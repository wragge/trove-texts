The RED PAGE
To a Caricaturist
To force the private soul grow public by a face
Known ev’ry where, but ne’er before with all the
springs,
Bolts, keys, and catches, drop-locks, winding
wheels, and cogs
Revealed to vulgar gaze; that each man for himself
May see that quaint machine whereby false smiles
are made,
Rolled eyes and clockwork tears or countenances
screwed
To just abhorrence of an ostentatious vice.
How curious to mark for one fleet breathing space
That oil-soakt hinge which throws the fringed lid
of shame
(So well assumed) down to the earth when devils
talk—
All this dost thou, and more. . . . The world thy
bitter brain
Fears with an anxious hatred, for chaos travels
Eddying in thy wake. . . . Friends see in friends
their foes,
And open foes grow friends by contrast to their
friends.
O, whither shall they run? . . . Death cannot
rescue them
If thou, who e’en can penetrate the grave, were by.
The whited stone would blush to tell its common
lie.
HUGH McCRAE.
The American Novel
American novel, with its
1 fashion-plate heroine beaming at us
from the cover, its illustrations in
lordly color, its beautiful type, and its
immediate appeal, is nowadays the stand-
ing dish at all our libraries. Let us
adventure among the strident best-sellers
in quest of a work of art.
\t>
Out of the unromantic night, out of the
sombre blurring January fog, came a voice
lifted in song, a soprano, rich, full and
round, young, yet matured, sweet and mys-
terious as a night-bird’s, haunting and elusive
as the murmur of the sea in a shell. . . .
Hillard, genuinely astonished, lowered his
pipe and listened.
And the tired novel-reader, taking up
The Lure of the Mash, the latest best-
seller of Harold Macgrath (Bobbs, Mer-
rill, Hew York, per G. Robertson) knows
that Hillard will chase and capture and
marry that multi-adjectived voice. Books
of this kind are evidently written for the
jaded mind of the American business-
man, or the lush sentimentalism of the
American girl. You do not have to
think; the novelist does not venture on
character development or indeed on any-
thing except a mildly exciting plot. The
inveterate novel-reader can guess the end
of every chapter—which is subtly flatter-
ing to Harold Macgrath’s cloudy-minded
public. And Harold does pile it on !
Ah ! but her eyes were blue; blue as
spring-water in the morning, blue as the
summer sky seen through a cleft in the
mountains, blue as . . .
And, lest you should get puzzled and
drop the book, Harold lets you partially
into the secret behind the mask ; but he
is careful to keep the tricks of plot
pleasantly conventional and the denoue-
ments happily familiar. And, for the rest,
the reader who is about to visit Italy can
find in this much-padded story, written
by a cunning man for adult-children,
enough descriptive passages about that
Dago peninsula to save him the purchase
of a Baedecker.
The inevitable (American) Winston
Churchill is too wise to stray from the
broad track that leads to the best
seller, and his latest, Mr. C'reiue’s Career,
(Macmillan) keeps steadily in the middle
of the macadamised road. He conforms
to the well-worn formula of the popular
novel. He takes a man and a maid,
whom everybody but their stupid selves
knows will wed in the last page. He
places between them a villain named Cir-
cumstances, and not till the click has
gone for the dropping of the curtain does
he allow the hero to run the villain
through and clasp the maid to his
bosom in the limelight, to the
chime of wedding-bells heard “off.”
The Circumstances vary—but the most
useful recipe is to take a popular question
of the day, and sandwich the love-scenes
in between. So you hurry through the
Circumstances in order to reach the
kisses. Thus you are spared any anguish,
for you know that the hero will get the
heroine anyhow. Thus you know that
you are buying a happy ending—in
this book you are even buying an account
of the wedding, which is generous of
Winston. The Circumstances in this
case are the shady politics of one of
America’s United States, where the
machine runs the legislators, and the
railroad boss works the machine. It is
a pleasant tale, cynically told, in all
essentials the Average Popular Novel,
rather well done.
\»>
We handle sterner stuff in Holman
Day’s King Spruce (Harper, per Dymock’s
Library), a stirring tale of lumbering in
the Maine woods. Exciting things hap-
pen, and they happen all the time, and
most of the characters speak in staccato.
Here, for instance, is the gentle heroine
in casual chat with her millionaire father:
“You want me to marry that bland and
blessed son and heir. But I’ll not do any
such thing. . . . He isn’t the man I want for
a husband ; and when John Barrett’s only
daughter tells him that with all her heart and
soul, I don’t believe John Barrett is going
to argue the question or ask for further
reasons or give any orders.”
John Barrett isn’t. But it is only fair
to state that the things that happen in
the Maine forest demand the staccato.
The novelist has the excuse of abounding
incident if at times his tone is too forced,
if, as a whole, the book is written at too
shrill a pitch. The yarn is cleverly con-
structed, without loose ends, and robustly
handled, with psychological insight and
a varied assortment of clear-etched
characters. It gives a picture of Ameri-
can lumbering methods that is graphic,
and, with due allowances for the necessi-
ties of romance, possible and true. Most
interesting of his pictures is that of a
group of inter-bred and but half-human
wastrels, degenerates of Cretinism, who
dwell like outlaws in the forest depths.
He had thought there could be no worse
in human guise than those he had seen. But
this huge, hairy, shaggy, almost naked giant,
cowering against the side of a shack with all
the timidity of a child, marked a climax even
to such degeneracy as he had quailed before.
“Mind in him about five years old,
and will always stay five years old,” said
the guide, pointing to the wistful, suffering
face. “Body speaks for itself. Look at
them muscles ! I’ve seen him ploughin’,
hitched with their cow. ...”
“An animal ! ” Wade gasped.
“ Not much else. Afraid of the dark, of
shadows, and women, mostly. Once a
woman scared him in Castonia, and he ran
away like a hoss, draggin’ the jumper. Old
Jule hitched him to a post after that.”
\f/
And Holman Day writes with a
psychological truth rare in the popular
novel. Here is his situation of the man
who at last gets his enemy into his power
—and doesn’t know what to do with him.
“ It all goes to show that in this world most
men don’t do what they think they’ll do,
when it comes to a big matter. I don’t
want to kill you, now that I have you where
I want you. It would be like batting a
sheep to death. ... It seems funny to think
that way, after all the thinking I’ve done
about what I would do to you.”
And here is his matter-of-fact summa-
tion of a dramatic climax :
An imaginative man might have seen the
new spirit of the woods facing the old.
But there were no imaginative men there
—there were only men who chewed tobacco
and wondered what it all meant.
The main defect of the yarn is the
apposite manner in which the characters
turn up at the right dramatic time ; but
this, in a popular novel of incident, is
bound to happen. King Spruce, from this,
very fault, would make a fine drama.'
And the quaint “ It’ll-Get-Ye Club,”
composed of the men who have been
maimed and rendered useless by lumber-
ing accidents, with their humorously
pessimistic comment, would act as the
chorus of that drama. It is a virile yarn,
and will be widely read.
vl/
But in The Coast of Chance, by Esther and
Lucia Chamberlain (Bobbs, Merrill, per
N.S.W. Bookstall Co.), we come to the
end of our quest of the real American
novel. This is a delicate, subtle thing, a
strange gem exquisitely wrought, the
paradox of a detective story concerned
rather with character analysis than with
incident. Yet it is supremely exciting.
But in the method of this story there is
real cleverness, and in the character
studies we meet real people, subtly and
intimately drawn. The style is lucid and
exact, the manner delicately influenced
by the literary craft of the inevitable
Henry James. The book is so admirably
written, without an ounce of padding, that
it cannot well be judged by quotation.
The plot has to do with the theft of a cele-
brated ring ; but the people fit the plot,
and the novel is a piece of even texture
throughout. The characters are alive and
real, hinted at with apt phrase rather
than described. It is a popular novel
done with cunning craft; and the secret
of the plot is admirably kept. If this is
a first novel of the Chamberlain ladies,
they have caught the manner with a
rattier surprising aptitude. We expect,
after S. E. White and Jack London, to
find in America virile novels like King
Spruce; but this feminine and subtle
thing, The Coast of Chance, is an unex-
pected discovery among the raucous
horde of best sellers.
The Poet Elucidative
Somewhat pained, J. le Gay Brereton
furnishes some helpful clues :
With the appearance of J. le Gay
Brereton’s Sea and Sky comes a Red Page
review, kindly, feminine and graceful. The
critic has an eye for form, and, when she
praises, her praise is worth having. Beyond
the form she does not penetrate far. For
her Brereton’s “ message ” —is the term not
yet out of fashion ?—is “elusive ”; and since
it eludes her, she suspects it is non-existent—
“Brereton, having nothing to say, says it
charmingly.” In a sense, none of us has
anything new to say ; but if to the expres-
sion of old thoughts we give a personal tone,
the artistic result is new ; and this writer’s
note is his own, and not, as the critic
hints, Tennysonian. He says some things
which, though as ancient as truth, are yet
new in Australian poetry. Even in
theme he appears to have chipped
at some new ground. An English critic
has said of the section named Oithona, “I
know nothing in literature that deals with
the same theme,” namely, the antenatal ex-
istence of a child in a dream-world brought
into view by the desires of her parents, and
the influence of that child upon their emo-
tions. Throughout, Brereton transmutes
fact into dream, and he does it deliberately.
How else should he arrive at truth ?
\l )
At first glance, his book may appear a
fortuitous drift-pile of casual lyrics. On the
contrary, there is continuity and cohesion.
After a dedication in which he entrusts his
meaning to the elucidation of love, the
author, in a “Foreword,” gives the key to
his symbolism by explaining the title, Sea
and Sky. Then comes the body of the
book, divided into sections under significant
headings. In “Ideals” we have a warning
prelude and improvisations upon the twofold
theme—human love and the perception of
the divine. “ Shadow ” hints at a means of
escape from the coils of a cold materialism.
The shadow drifts by ; there are clouds that
melt, and there is sufficient thunder to clear
the air. Then, in orderly progress, we have
poems which proclaim, primarily, the delights
of courtship, nuptial love, and parentage.
But though there is no inclination to under-
value sensuous beauty and the “fierce unde-
niable attraction ” of sex, Brereton does not
“ wallow in a sensual sty.” Sex is a mystery
which he reveres, finding therein meanifig
beyond meaning. Phallic worship is no
obscene frenzy of the races which have
passed into flying dust, but a living creed.
There are still worshippers who hang garlands
about the honest garden god.
“ Through your eyes
I see an universe by love made whole ”
is no idle compliment.
if/
Surely, then, we may expect some reve-
lation—or at least some further sug-
gestion—of so stupendous and beatific a
vision. In its broad features it is
perhaps given least incompletely in
“The Silver Gull,” a celebration of a cos-
mic emotion and a vision of divine harmony
which it is impossible to describe in the
language of ordinary experience, though it
may be suggested with simplicity and clear-
ness by the use of poetic symbols. Here he
can only indicate very crudely the drift of
the poem. In his sympathy with the life of
earth-born creatures the poet identifies
himself with the bird of the sea,
whereby he sheds the wealth of the
world and wins the treasure of poverty,
which is freedom. In exaltation of spirit he
is borne from one plane to another on the
spreading wings of universal sympathy. He
is the world-enclosing air and all within it.
All vital energies are his, and, despite variety
of expression, all alike are good. Yet the
imagination can transcend all bounds, and at
last he attains identity with the spirit of joy,
“unbodied, supreme,” from which all else
emanates. Still he flies with the sea-bird.
The higher does not destroy, but transfigures
and intensifies the lower sympathy. It is
merely the dream of a drunken man ; but
then he is intoxicated with the wine of
Dionysus, of which perhaps you have heard.
Other lyrics treat of separate aspects of
the vision and its relation to our daily
business. [And here, regretfully, space-con-
siderations compel us to delete an equally ela-
borate explanation of “Twain.” However —]
The household fire of earthly affection
burns with a clearer flame because we have
caught a visionary gleam of the tire which is
divine.
Enough—here are clues. If they are not
worth following, so be it. The question was
not whether Brereton had anything worth
saying, but whether he was retailing the
stock ideas of the daily versifier. And can
it be true that he is £ ‘ too domestic for the
taste of the general reader ? ” Does the
general reader really prefer the desire of the
streets to the love of a Beatrice who not only
may bless his eyesight upon earth, but will
lead him in an ecstasy from sphere to shin-
ing sphere ?
J. LE GAY BRERETON.
So the reader can take his choice. He
can read either the book or its explana-
tion.
—♦
“ Hell ” is the most exciting item in Fire
o’ the Flame, the daintily produced fourth
number of The Heart of the Bose (Lothian,
Melb.). It is Bernard O’Dowd who gives us
“Hell.” From his guide-book of the
locality we learn a number of interesting
facts, evidently gained at first hand.
“From the visitors’ point of view,”
he blithely begins, “the most awful
thing about Hell is the inability of its
denizens to recognise anybody who speaks to
them. .. . Indeed, one gets to think
that the rescue of those in Hell (which
will have to be done, if the universe
itself is to finally endure) will be most
easily effected by the injection of some
great Name into the brain-cells of the
Lost, for if they can utter It, they are
thereby brought into such direct connection
with the uplifting forces of the universe
that it is only a matter of time for
them to think Hell away, and be again.”
Well .. . Bernard ought to know. The
rest of Flame o’ the Fire is pretty little
poems by Australian bards. Despite the
literary slightness of this flaming little
magazine, we are glad to note the possi-
bility of a publication so eesthetic in a con-
tinent so prosaic.
Australian Architecture (G. Robertson), by
Robt. J. Haddon, a Melb. architect, is a
technical manual not for the general reader.
But the book is valuable to the student
because of its special application to Aus-
tralian conditions. Haddon’s sane ideas may
be indicated by this panegyric upon a brick :
Take a brick : an ordinary brick is turned out
reasonably square, uniform in color, with a hard
resisting surface. How should such an article be
treated ? It is obviously unreasonable to seek to
make a cabinet-work finish of it. To smear it over
with added color, to tuckpoint it with more or less
mock joints is, therefore, to destroy its natural
quality. It is a brick and .... must look what it
should look, strong and sufficient in itself.
There is no doubt that architecture in
Australia has been too long a senseless copy
of a style of building suitable to a damper
and colder environment ; and Haddon’s book
is but one indication (Art and Architecture
is another) that this continent is beginning
to evolve an architecture to suit itself. Mean-
time, every brick is advised be a brick.
Australia To-day is offering a prize of £25 for
“ the best poem on ‘ The Defence of Australia,’ ”
and another prize of the same amount for “the
best popular prose essay on ‘ Social Life in Aus-
tralia, its Advantages and Outlook.’ ’’ The poem
must not exceed 1000 words, and the essay 7000
words, MS. to be typewritten, and signed by a
pen-name only, and accompanied by the usual
sealed envelope, containing name and address.
Date of closing 2nd November, at 190 Flinders-

A WONDERFUL CURE
FOR INDIGESTION
REDFERN TESTIMONY.
“Each morning I woke with the consciousness
that something was not right,” remarked Mr.
William Johnston, of No. 127 Eveleigh Street,
Redfern, to a newspaper representative, who was
making some enquiries. Continuing he said : “I
felt as if I was in for a spell of sickness, and, sure
enough, those misgivings foretold what afterwards
happened. You see, the heat was pretty consider-
able where I was, up at Mole, seventy miles from
Warren, 115 deg. in the shade for a week at a
stretch being regarded as only a fleabite to what
could happen when the sun was in good form, and
too much of that sort of business gets on a man’s
nerves, and runs him down a bit, I tell you, and
I think I ought to know.”
“ Of course, because you are speaking from ex-
perience,” interrupted the scribe.
‘ < Exactly. There were a good few of us working
at an artesian bore, which ejected soda water —
without. I need scarcely remark, any whisky in it
—and too much soda straight is not good. In-
deed, it proved very bad for us, and as we never
got within reach of anything in the way of vege-
tables, it is only to be expected that the conse-
quences were very bad for the blood. Mine, like
the rest, was in a terrible state, sores breaking out
in all directions, and the flies were so troublesome
that we had to go away and sit in the dark to get
a little peace. The remedies I tried to put myself
in order with were of no avail, and my sufferings
became unbearable. When I sat down to a meal
I would get half way through when an attack of
retching always occurred, so no wonder my strength
fell off like it did. I became as weak as a kitten,
and, the work being laborious, I could not keep
going. Matters were about at their worst, when
the overseer went over to Bourke, and returned
with some Clements Tonic for the men, and I give
you my word as an honorable man, that after I had
taken but one bottle I felt a different being en-
tirely. The headaches that I had beforehand
were enough to destroy one’s happiness, without
anything else 5 but, besides, I had most of those
wretched symptoms which usually accompany in-
digestion. To begin with, my chest felt quite
clogged up, as though I had swallowed a lump of
dough that was clogging the breathing passages
and about my loins. I felt as if I had been beaten
with a stick—sore and aching. Again, under the
blades of my shoulders there were shap, pricking
sensations as if a needle were at work, and m
addition to all else, there was a perpetual feeling
of weariness as if I had run myself to death.
When getting out of bed of a morning, I would
have to hold on to it to steady myself, the dizzi-
ness being so great that I would have overbalanced,
and all the time I was going down-hill fast. My
weight was disappearing in a most alarming man-
ner, and I dread to think of what would have
happened had not Clements Tonic made its timely
appearance, through the kindness of our overseer.”
‘ ‘ He had probably used it himself on some pre-
vious occasion ? ” hazarded the writer.
“He said so, and swore by it. There is no med-
icine in the world to equal Clements Tonic, he
used to say, and, my word, he was right, for it
fixed us up splendidly. Its purifying effects on
mv blood cannot be too highly spoken of. Enough
to say that the sores soon disappeared, after which
I rested better. I began to. eat more freely and
regularly under Clements Tonic’s influence, and
the retching after meals became a thing of the
past. And if Clements Tonic cannot cure indi-
gestion quicker than anything else, I’m a Dutch-
man. It put me right out of touch with each
symptom belonging to that complaint in no time;
then it added to its wonderful work by steadying
my nerves, and giving me as much strength as a
man could wish for. Whenever I meet a person,
either man or woman, suffering in any particular
like I did myself, I just tell them what I know
Clements Tonic can do, as in my case, and if they
don’t go and get a bottle or two of that remedy,
then all I can say is, they deserve to suffer. Pub-
lish this any way you please.”

Erosion.
Ever to the high hill’s crest
Swept the winds from east and west,
Roared the gales from north and southward up
the mountain’s rugged sides ;
Winds from distant tracts and dunes ;
Winds from downs and hot lagoons ;
Winds from dark and desolation, where eternal
cold abides.
As of old they whined and wailed
As their restless blasts assailed
Beetling crag and riven boulder of the worn and
aged hill
That, in immemorial time,
Loomed a mighty mass sublime,
And, with rugged brows of granite, frowned on
its assailants still.
Never giant shall withstand
Beat of rain and sleet of sand,
Though his majesty be lifted, like a dome, against
the skies;
All the fretful winds that blow
Wreck and seek to lay him low,
Wear him through the endless ages, till supine at
last he lies.
He that loomed across the plains,
Lording over mountain-chains,
Crowned with snows against the sunrise, with his
head reared to the stars,
Shall in after ages shrink
Into nothingness, and sink
Down to levels of the waters and the silled river-
bars.
For against his dizzy crest
Sweep the winds from east and west;
Jealous of his exaltation chafe the old tormenting
throng;
Never giant shall withstand
Beat of rain and sleet of sand
At his stubborn bulk for ever, though he triumph
ages long.

The Trees in Collins-street.
The trees—the trees in Gollins-street
Are showing spots of tender green;
Shyly the New Year trappings sweet
Cling to the limbs of each wood-queen,
Telling the news that Spring is come
To us who pass on restless feet,
With eyes downcast and senses numb,
Beneath the trees of Collins-street.
The trees —the trees in Collins-street
Make colonnades of spreading shade,
Where She and I may sometimes meet,
Whilst branches by the wind are swayed.
The dappled shadows that they fling
Play on her gown, whilst I repeat
The joyous message of the Spring
Brought by the trees in Collins-street.
The trees —the trees in Collins-street
Are bowls of gold when April’s nigh,
And Nature with a gay conceit
Displays her wealth. The misers sigh
And wander thoughtfully to town.
At night the blue electrics beat
On many a radiant golden crown
High on the trees of Collins-street.
The trees —the trees of Collins-street,
Clad in their Springtime dress of green !
Oh ! slowly go our wearied feet
And a dear silence falls between ;
When the grey city lies behind
And we but faintly hear the beat
Of its great heart, sweet peace we find
Beneath the trees of Collins-street.

COLD CHARITY.
In order to mitigate the serious unemployed trouble in Great Britain the Admiralty ordered five new cruisers to be constructed by private shipbuilding firms. The
authorities also invited tenders for 14 large ocean-going destroyers at an earlier period, than they otherwise would have done, in order to give work to the men who were idle.
John Bull gives his famishing unemployed a cup of water, while his protected neighbor helps himself by the bucketful.

WHAT IS A SEAT OF GOVERNMENT?
The Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be
determined by The Parliament, and shall be within terri-
tory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the
Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the
Commonwealth, and if New South Wales bean Original
State shall be in that State, and bf, distant not dess than
ONF. HUNDRED SULKS FROM SYDNEY.— CICLUSe 125 Of the
Constitution.
The ballot of the House of Representatives re the
Federal capital site has created a difficult problem,
which was almost overlooked at first; it only rose
like a troubled ghost within the last few days. It
involves the settlement of the legal question,
“What is a Seat of Government”? and that
appears to be only a new and worse version of
the dreadful old conundrum, “What is a Place?
—a conundrum which has wrecked more legal front
teeth than any other of the day. In this instance
the craving to drag everything right up against
Sydney’s back door has been carried as far as can
be done with safety, and possibly a little farther.
Some ten years ago, by a disreputable trick, all
Queensland, Westralia, South Australia, the
Northern Territory, Tasmania and Victoria were
disqualified as possible Seats of Federal Govern-
ment. The N.S.W. State Legislature, at the in-
stigation of the Reid Ministry, demanded
that these places should all be set down as unfit
or unclean or accursed, or words to that effect.
But by way of some slight concession the said
State Legislature consented that Sydney and an
area 100 miles wide around Sydney should also be
disqualified. The Legislature at Sydney de-
manded the complete disqualification of Mel-
bourne and 87,884 square miles attached thereto ;
of Brisbane and the 608,497 square miles of ad-
jacent country ; of Adelaide and the 903,690
square miles ruled from that city ; of Perth with
975,920 square miles of land adjoining; and of
Hobart and the 26,215 square miles of terri-
tory of which it is the political centre.
This looked so like an attempt to dis-
qualify every place except Sydney, and to
regard Federation solely as a means of bringing
wealth to Sydney, that by way of a self-denying
ordinance the N.S.W. capital and 100 miles of
adjacent land were likewise barred out. It was a
most unsatisfactory compromise, but when the
N.S.W. Legislature annulled the popular accept-
ance;of the original Constitution, something had
to be done in the way of compromise.
* * * *
Now, in the intense desire to drag everything
as close as possible to Sydney, the N.S.W. section
of the House of Representatives has secured a
vote in favor of a Federal capital territory which
is to straddle right across the 100-mile line. The
votes which made a majority for the Yass-Can-
berra site were obtained by large general assur-
ances about a Federal port at Jervis Bay and
other things. The Sydney daily papers were
eloquent about the great superiority of Jervis Bay
as compared with Twofold Bay, the sea-outlet for
a capital on Monaro. They and the State Govern-
ment were both large and vague in their assur-
ances about the grant by the State of a liberal
area of land if the Australian capital were planted
at Yass-Canberra, and about an allowance of land
whereon to build a railway to Jervis Bay, and also
concerning a seaport there. If these promises are
carried out, the arrangement will necessitate the
Federal territory being a long, attenuated strip,
of which one end will be some miles outside the
100-miles limit from Sydney and the other end 13
miles inside that limit. And whether this arrange-
ment is legal or not will depend partly on the
settlement of the question : “What is a Seat of
Government?” and partly on the settlement of
another question.
If a Seat of Government is simply the building
in which Federal laws are made, then it is obvious
that the Yassberra-Jervis Bay selection would
be legal enough. In that case, in fact, it
probably wouldn’t matter if the Parliamentary
refreshment room was over the line, so long as
Parliament House itself wasn’t. If the Seat
means Parliament House and the Government
buildings in which is done the official Work
without which there would be no Govern-
ment at all, and without which Parliament
would be a mere abstract expression of opin-
ion, then also the Yassberra-Jervis Bay site
would be legal, provided care were taken
that no outlying official buildings slopped over
the line, and provided the Governor-General, who
is a necessary item of the Government and of the
Seat thereof,' didn’t want to live where he could
have a sea-view, and sea-baths on summer morn-
ings, and where he could run naked on the beach.
If the whole Federal city is the Seat of Govern-
ment, then all would still, apparently, be well, if
sufficient care were taken to put the city at the
legal end of the Federal territory. But if the Seat
of Government is the territory which is granted or
acquired for purposes of Federal Government then
the ’Berra-Jervis Bay site is wholly illegal, and in
the unscrupulous struggle to drag everything to
Sydney things have been dragged too far. It is
not merely a question of a capital; the term
“ capital’’"might be legally definable, or again it
might not. But a Seat of Government is a large,
vague problem and a new expression. It suggests
the whole area that the Government sits on, and
the Government may be held to sit officially
on the whole territory which is allotted to
it for governing purposes; else why was
the territory allotted ? The Seat can’t be
the mere area that the Government sits
on literally or in the plain, fleshy sense, for
then whenever the Government stood up there
would be no area at all, and a Government that
was standing up would have no Seat so long as it
stood.
The statement that the Seat of Government
is to be “within territory which shall have been
granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth ”
doesn’t help the matter. If the clause stated
that the Seat of Government should be in the
middle of the territory, and that round it there
should be a wide fringe which wasn’t Seat, the
matter would be fairly clear, but nobody antici-
pated, or provided for, the frantic greedy struggle
that has been made to balance the Federal City
right on the thin edge of Sydney in order to grab
all the trade, so there is no such definition. The
word “within” throws no light on the subject.
A snail is within its shell, but the contents of the
shell are presumably all snail. A ballet-girl is
within her tights, but unless she is padded the
contents of the tights are all girl. A man may be
within his rights, but it doesn’t follow that there
is room for another man within the same rights.
Also, seven devils may be within a man, but that
doesn’t show that there is room for another devil.
In fact, the man may be packed so tightly that if
he tried to hold another devil he would burst. And
in like manner, though the Seat of Government
is within the Federal territory, that doesn’t demon-
strate that the contents of the Federal Territory
aren’t all Seat, and if they are all Seat then the
promise of a Federal port at Jervis Bay was
almost certainly a reckless lie and an obtaining of
votes by false pretences. The State Rights press,
which desires above all things a mean little Aus-
tralian metropolis that will be completely over-
shadowed by the State capitals, of course brushes
this question aside in an off-hand manner. It is
quite natural that it should do so, for if a Federal
city came to be planted at Yassberra because of
the promise of a sea-outlet at Jervis Bay, and
because of the consequent chance of commercial
and industrial expansion, and that sea-outlet was
afterwards cut off by legal decision, no one would
be gladder than the Tory and State Rights
press. If any false promise could fix
the capital where it would ultimately become
a nlere appanage or mean suburb of a big State
city, the State Rights press would probably regard
the false promise as a good investment. It has
bitterly opposed the idea of a federal port, and it
it could, by a wholly unreliable assurance that
there would be a Federal port, bring the capital
where, in the end, there would be no Federal
port, it would have achieved its purpose. On the
other hand, to put the capital where it would have
a Federal port, about its title to which there was
no doubt whatever, would be contrary to the whole
State Rights policy. The confidence man who
sells a gold brick always wants to be sure it is a
brick, and if he sells real gold by mistake he grows
wild. So the State Rights press declares airily that
the Australian Government can just as well own
a port inside the Sydney 100-miles limit as
it can own a Custom-house at Sydney or a
bit of ground for an office at Parramatta.
The unfortunate difficulty is that, if the Aus-
tralian Government wanted a Customs house at
Svdnev or a bit of land at Parramatta for Seat of
Government purposes, it couldn't own any such
thing, because, just like Jervis Bay, these places
are within the forbidden 100-miles radius.
* * * *
Furthermore, it would require very deep thought
to decide whether Clause 125 means that the Seat
of Government (which may be only a part of the
Federal territory, or which, again, may be the
whole Federal territory) is to be not less than 100
miles from Sydney, or that the entire Federal
territory, apart from any question of the Seat of
Government, is to be not less than 100 miles from
Sydney. Let the clause be considered again in
all its uncertainty :
The Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall
be determined by the Parliament, and shall be within
territory . , ,
WHICH shall have been granted to or acquired by the
Commonwealth, and shall he vested in and belong to the
Commonwealth, and if New South Wales be an Original
State shall be in that State and be distant not less than
100 miles from Sydney.
The ‘‘which” plainly refers, not to the Seat of
Government, whatever that may mean, but to the
whole Federal territory. And if the “which”
continues to refer to the whole territory—as it
seems to do, seeing that no other “which” turns
up, then the whole Federal territory wherein the
Seat of Government is located must be at least
100 miles from Sydney. And in that case the
acquisition of votes for a Yassberra site on the
ground that it was to include a Federal port at
Jervis Bay, 13 miles inside the 100-mile limit, was
pure confidence trick, and was own brother to the
rich uncle in Fiji.
By wav of a side issue, the people who want to
strain the spirit and letter of the desperately hard
bargain which their Shylocic Government drove
with Australia rely on Clause 111 of the Consti-
tution, which says :
The Parliament of a State may surrender any part of
the State to the Commonwealth, and upon such surrender
and the acceptance thereof by the Commonwealth, such
part shall become subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Commonwealth.
On these grounds apparently N.S.W. can cede
to the Commonwealth Jervis Bay, or part of it, or
the bit of land leading to it, or any other place
inside the 100-miles radius of Sydney ; and so long
as the bit of ceded territory isn’t used for Seat of
Government purposes, and isn’t part of the
Federal territory ceded for Seat of Government
purposes, all will be well. But if it is used for
Seat of Government purposes, or is part of the
territory ceded for Seat of Government purposes,
all will be very far from well. In fact, all will be
sick and darned bad. Now the whole proposal of
the Jervis Bay cession is bound up with the
question of the Seat of Government. The scrap
of Bay which the grudging Wade proposes to
transfer to the Commonwealth is to be joined on
to the Seat of Government territory, and to be
part of it; and its cession has been made almost a
condition of the selection of the Yassberra capital
site. And even if, after much consideration of
the “ which ” in Clause 125, it is decided that it is
the Seat of Government (whatever that may be),
and not the whole Federal territory, that is to be
at least 100 miles from Sydney, the fact remains
that unless that Seat can be defined, and nailed
down at the legal end of the Federal territory,
and rigidly prevented from slopping over into the
doubtful end, the promised port at Jervis Bay is
liable to be snatched away from the Common-
wealth just as soon as the expenditure of much
good Australian money has made it worth snatch-
ing, and as soon as some enthusiastic anti-
Federalist feels like hiring a barristerial snatcher
to raise the point.
It is all a mean, miserable, sordid, grudging,
ungenerous process of grabbing at the last copper
whether it is an ill-gotten and dubious copper or
not. It was the N.S.W. Government which
asked the other States to join in a Federation.
When the N.S.W. people accepted the original
Constitution, which left the location of the capital
an open question, and which might ultimately have
resulted in Sydney being the chosen metropolis
of Australia," the N.S.W. Legislature nullified
their decision, and demanded that all the States
which it had invited to join it should be dis-
qualified as possible sites for the capital. The
other States assented, and in return it was pro-
mised that the Seat of Government, or the
Federal territory containing the Seat of Govern-
ment, though ” in N.S.W., was not to be
within 100 miles of Sydney. On top of
that came the new demand that the N.S.W.
Parliament should have a right of veto
as regards the site for the capital of all Australia,
even though the place selected might fully con-
form to the spirit and letter of the Constitution.
Also there rose the further demand that it should
decide the area of the Federal territory, that it
should control the Federal city’s water-supply,
and even that the Federal city should be so situ-
ated that all its trade should go to Sydney.
Finally, having secured the selection, so far as the
House of Representatives is concerned, of a site
at Sydney’s back-door, by vague and loose assur-
ances about a liberal grant of land and the grant
of a sea-outlet, the liberal grant of land proves, if
it is possible to judge by Premier Wade’s hints,
to be an area smaller than that occupied by
Brisbane and its suburbs, and the port shows
signs of shrinking to a mere bit of space for a
wharf ; and the title to even that scrap of beach
seems distinctly uncertain, because the port will lie
13 miles nearer to Sydney than the Constitution
allows. In fact, a whole lot of the promised ter-
ritory will be inside the forbidden limit and will
be held by a shaky title. It is a poor, shabby,
police-court-lawyer affair from first to last—a
business worthy of what the lucid Yankee slang
calls a “shyster,” the same being a term which
describes the down-at-heel practitioner who car-
ries his documents in his hat, and rises to address
his Worship on a profound technical point bear-
ing on a half-crown case about a dog. And all
this row and all this straining of the Constitution
are done in order that more population may be
congested in what is already the most congested
part of Australia. The county of Bourke, in which
Melbourne stands, had, at last census, 304 people
to every square mile, and considering that the
Victorian average was less than 14 people to the
square mile this was a shameful affair. But the
County of Cumberland, in which Sydney stands,
had at the same date 3(32 people to the square
mile, and considering that the average in iN.S. W.
was less than persons to the square mile that
was at least a three-times worse case of congestion
than even the Victorian instance. The clamorous
desire to place the capital of Australia where its
trade, by going entirely to Sydney, will swell the
most aggravated human congestion in this con-
tinent to something worse even than it is, is a
sorrowful business.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Private Landlord and the Small Federal
Territory.
There is a profound method in the apparent mad-
ness of those people who advocate tne restriction
of the Federal capital territory to a mere scrap of
100 or 200 square miles. It is a cash method, and
the madness has a solid financial basis. The
Federal city, even if it is planted in such an un-
favorable spot that it can’t become a very large
city, will necessarily, because of its official popula-
tion alone, be a place of some importance. Its
establishment will create a great increase in land
values—an increase almost certainly far in excess
of the monev spent V)}' the Commonwealth on the
city itself. " That increase will spread for a
considerable distance around the city. If the
Federal capital stands somewhere towards the
centre of a Federal area of, say, 2000 or
5000 square miles, the increase in land values
will probably spread over most of the
Federal territory; if the city stands on a
Federal area of, say, 150 or 200 square miles, the
profit created will spread far beyond its own terri-
tory, and much of it will be mopped up by the
adjacent State and the landlords thereof. That
is to say, the wealth created by the expenditure
of the money of all Australia will largely go to the
landlords of one State of Australia. N.S.W.
stands, in the matter of population, for about two-
fifths of Australia. If it transfers 1000 square
miles of country to the Commonwealth it will
still liave a two-fifths interest—equal to 400
square miles—in the transferred property,
so its actual sacrifice will be 600 square
miles. If it transfers only 200 square miles its
interest in the transferred property will be equal
to 80 square miles, so its sacrifice will be only 120
square miles. In no case is the sacrifice anything
like so large as it looks. In the construction of
the public works of the new capital (streets,
pavements, drains, buildings, etc.) let it be
assumed that the Commonwealth will spend
£s,ooo,ooo—one sum is as good for purposes of cal-
culation as another—in which case N.S.W.’s share
of the outlay will be £2,000,000 ; also, its interest
in the Federal property will be worth £2,000,000.
If Private Enterprise” spends an equal sum on
houses, warehouses, gardens, shops, fences, etc.,
and if the value of improvements bears the same
proportion to the land values which the improve-
ments create as they do in Sydney, the expendi-
ture of that £10,000,000 (of which N.S.W. will
have contributed in a taxpaying sense £2,000,000)
will create £8,000,000 of land values, of which
N.S.W.’s undivided share as a partner in the
Commonwealth, if the whole of these new land
values are within Federal territory, will be
£3,200,000. That is to say, on this basis N.S.W.
will pay £2,000,000 towards the construction of an
Australian capital, and the value of its interest
in the capital and in the land values
created bv the building of the capital
will be £5.200,000. It will share on a
population basis, exactly the same as the
other States, and it will have a special advantage,
inasmuch as the establishment of the capital in
N.S.W. will bring much profitable business to the
N.S.W. railways, while to those of Queensland,
Tasmania, S. A.’, and Westralia it will bring none.
But if the Federal territory can be cut so small
that a great part of the land to which its estab-
ment must give a new value will lie outside the
Federal territory, then it is quite possible that
out of the £8,000,000 of land values created by the
expenditure of the money of all Australia
£3,000,000 will lie over the border in N.S.W. In
that case Premier Wade S State taxpayer will
have contributed £2,00(1,000 towards the construc-
tion of a capital, and will have as a sec-off : (1) An
interest worth £2,000,000 in the Federal capital;
(2) an interest worth £2,000,000 in the land values
(total value £5,000,000) which the expenditure of
public and private money will have created inside
<he Federal territory; (3) £3,000,000 worth of
new land values in the adjacent parts of N.S.W.
created by the expenditure of the money of all
Australia on the Federal capital and territory ;
and (4) most of the railway profits (value un-
known) of the business created by the new city.
That shows a fairly large gain on the transaction.
As a contra , N.S.W. will have given up its State
sovereignty over a bit of land which, under
present circumstances, is a dead loss, seeing that
it doesn’t yield enough revenue to pay for roads,
bridges, police and sundries. The only tangible
asset N.S.W. is to give away is the State land
within the ceded territory, but then there is none
that is of any real account in a revenue-producing
sense. For all private lands in the ceded area the
Commonwealth is to pay. The demand for a
miserable, cramped little Federal territory looks
like a good move in the interests of the State’s
private landlord, but Australia isn’t bound to
make sacrifices for the benefit of any private
landlord.
♦
The Farmer and the Freehold.
The debate on the N.S.W. Lands Bill gave the
remnant of the old Tory party in the Assembly,
and the members who are not openly Tory but
would be so if they dared, a chance to trot out the
old threadbare assertion that the farmer with only
a State lease, even if it be a 999 years’ lease, will
fail, for sentimental reasons, to take the same in-
terest in his work as the man with a freehold.
This is supposed to be one of the high patriotic
reasons why the N.S.W. Government is going to
give the State leaseholder the right, inalarge, whole-
sale fashion, to buy his land right out. Another
and much less perishable-looking reason is that the
Wade Government has got into such a stupendous
spending habit that, even with a revenue that is
miles ahead of anything any previous State
Government ever enjoyed, it sees scarcity ahead ,
so it proposes to adopt the easy, thriftless method of
wholesale, yet surreptitious, land-selling. If a State
leaseholder is paying £SO a year rent, and he is
allowed to buy his land right out for £2ooo—well,
the present Government will enjoy the ini a
lump, and some future one will feel the loss of the
£SO a year, and it will be all right, for the present
Government, anyhow. That looks a simple and
obvious explanation, while the tale about how the
State’s tenant farmer is discouraged for Jack of
the freehold, and so fails to put his whole soul and
shovel into?fhe business, looks a simple and ob-
vious lie. If that discouraged farmer was the real
trouble, the first case to be dealt with would not


be that of the State tenant, who, as a rule, has a
low rent and an easy landlord, but that of the
often rack-rented tenant of the private land-
holder ; and the first anxiety would be, not to
give the State tenant a right of com-
pulsory purchase on easy terms, but to
give the right of compulsory purchase on easy
terms to the miserable private tenants around
Picton, Campbelltown, Bathurst, Berry, Tam-
worth—in fact, to every man who rents his bit of
land from the private owner. There is quite a lot
of that kind of man. A very few years ago the
area occupied by tenant farmers in the district
around Sydney was set down at 200,683 acres ; in
the Lower Hunter, 642,474 acres; South Coast,
460,300 acres ; North Coast, 381,594 acres : Cen-
tral Tableland, 640,652 acres; Southern Table-
land, 628,184 acres. Therefore, in the mere scrap
of N.S.W. that is convenient to Sydney there
were, six or seven years ago, nearly 20,000 tenant
farmers pining for the freehold on nearly 3,000,000
acres of privately-owned land. Surely the beauti-
fully sympathetic frauds who weep so much about
the sufferings of the lightly-rented State tenant,
and about his craving for the freeehold, and about
the necessity of giving him the right to purchase
his holding from the owner at a low fixed price,
might think of these heavily rented 20,000 farmers,
and the need to give them the right of compulsory
purchase at a low, fixed price from the Antills
and Hays and Macarthur Onslows and their
tribe. The spectacle of certain big landlords,
whose servile and hat-touching tenantry turn
themselves into beasts of burden and drag the
squire’s carriage when he comes home after spend-
ing the rents in Europe, and whose serfs train one
swift boy in every family to run like the Devil and
open gates when the great man is seen coming—
the spectacle of landlords like these urging that the
farmer should have the freehold of his own farm
is calculated to create a heaving sensation in the
stomach region.
That “Generous Area.”
The large and generous-sounding announcement
made by N.S.W. State Premier Wade that he
would act liberally in the way of a grant of land
for a Federal capital if a site in the Canberra
neighborhood was adopted seems to have now
boiled down into a definite offer of “ between 100
and 200 square miles.” Even if this means the
whole 200 square miles, the area will only com-
pare with some existing cities as follows :
Acres.
Brisbane and suburbs 195,200
Melbourne ~ ~ 163,480
Federal City,, ~ 128,000
Adelaide ~ ~ .. .. .. 99,358
Sydney ~ ~ 93,094
That doesn’t look like any very gorgeous liber-
ality, and in point of fact the liberality isn’t even
a tenth so gorgeous as it looks. The State cities
find it necessary to have huge areas outside
their municipal boundaries for water catch-
ments, water channels, reservoirs, outlets for
drainage, sewage farms and the like. Sydney,
and Melbourne, for instance, would never dream of
allowing their water supply to be controlled even
by adjacent municipalities in whose territory the
water is collected, much less would they dream of
allowing control by adjacent States. Certainly
Sydney and Melbourne have enough influence in
their respective State Parliaments to make it
reasonably certain that they could make adjacent
municipalities keep the city water supply clean, but
even that isn’t regarded as sufficient. The Sydney
Board of Water Supply and Sewerage and the
Melbourne Board of Works were created in order
that Australia’s two big cities should have abso-
lute control over their water and sewerage sys-
tems. The same rule applies to the Brisbane
Board of Water Supply. But Premier Wade
holds that a system of divided or outside control,
which would be regarded as an absurdity in a pro-
vincial city, is quite good enough for the Austra-
lian capital. Sydney wouldn’t trust Parramatta,
or Liverpool, or Campbelltown to do the
fair thing by it in the matter of water
supply, though Sydney’s vote in the State
Assembly is quite large enough to suppress any ob-
jectionable proceedings on the part of Parramatta
or Liverpool or Campbelltown ; yet certain State
Fright politicians profess themselves quite unable
to understand why the capital of all Australia
shouldn’t be willing to depend on the State Legis-
lature for its water, the same to be clean or dirty,
scant or abundant, as the State authority feels in-
clined, though the said capital won’t have a single
vote in that State Legislature, and will have no
more direct legal control over its deeds or mis-
deeds in this line than if it were a foreign institu-
tion. It is a curious example of inability to put
oneself in the other fellow’s place, or of a violent
resolve not to consider the other fellow’s point of
view, or even to allow that he is entitled to possess
a point of view.

The Angels and the Decayed Meat.
The failure of George Reid’s motion of censure
in the House of Reps, was not a mere defeat —it
was a rout. Reid fled in wild disorder, leaving
behind him his baggage and his disorganised
forces, and saving only his Dry Dog and his eye-
glass out of the wreck. Since then the one or two
papers which still cling to Reid’s fallen fortunes
have tried to find satisfaction in pointing out how
iniquitous it was of the Forrest-Knox-Irvine
party not to stand' by Reid, and how degraded it
was for the Labor party to stand by Deakin, and
how degraded it was of Deakin to be thus stood
by, and how, in short, the House was divided into
two sections, the angels and the decayed meat, and
Reid’s slim minority was the angels, and the de-
cayed meat was everybody else. But the plain and
obvious reason for Reid’s failure was the utter
fatuousness of his case. In a general way, the
malcontents complained :
(1) That the Deakin Government raises far too much
revenue, and thus grievously oppresses the people.
(2) That it ought to return even more money than it
does to the State Governments (to do this it would have
to raise more revenue).
(3) That it returns too much to the State Governments,
and thus leads them into extravagant habits.
(4) That it proposes to return less to the State Govern-
ments, in order to find money for Defence, Old Age Pen-
sions, the taking over of the Northern Territory, etc.
(5) That all these things are urgent and necessary, but
that they shouldn’t be done with money “ taken from the
States.” A strange, mad idea rages in certain quarters
that the Australian Government should raise the neces-
sary funds by taxing Egypt, or Bolivia, or some such
place.
(6) That the Deakin Government is extravagant.
(7) That in its shameful and cheese-paring economy it
has starved the postal and other services into a condition
of utter inefficiency.
(7) That the fact that the Deakin Government has been
able, through this excessive economy, to pay the State
Governments, temporarily, very large sums over and
above the three-fourths secured to them by the Braddon
clause, gives the States a claim to equally large, if not
larger, sums in the future. At the same time, it is the
duty of the Deakin Government to find a huge sum of
money wherewith to put the Post-office in order, and at
the same time it ought to reduce taxation.
(8) That the proposed beginnings of the Defence
scheme are so small as to be ridiculous. They show an
absurd craze for economy. Also, they cost too much
money. Universal military training should be accom-
panied by universal payment. Also, the compulsory ser-
vice should be voluntary. At the same time, the cost
should be reduced—also increased. Further, the naval
subsidy to Britain should be greatly enlarged, and there
should be reductions in expenditure. What is wanted is
less outlay and more liberality, also not so much money
and more of it.
(7) That the Northern Territory should be taken over
at once without costing anybody anything. A good
transcontinental railway should be built instantly—
gratis. This railway should take the most direct track
through Victoria, N.S.W., Queensland, South Australia,
and the Northern Territory, so as to provide bee-line
communication between Melbourne, Adelaide, Port
Augusta, Sydney, Brisbane, Townsville, Port Darwin and
other places. It should go round by Kalgoorlie in a
straight line, and pass through the electorates of Bunt
and Wade and Fuller and Johnson on the way, and
traverse the property of “ Wingbn ” Abbott.
(8) That the Deakin Government should at once take
over the State debts on lines that will satisfy all the State
Premiers, and that it should get on faster with public
business, and not attempt to stifle freedom of debate.
There were other items also, and the whole affair
made a very large indictment, only the indictment
wouldn’t hang together. The men who said the
Deakin Ministry was too long wouldn’t vote with
those who said it was too short, and those who
said it was too broad wouldn’t vote with those
who said it was too narrow, and the men who de-
clared it was too thick preferred to support it
rather than join with those who said it was too
thin. So the attack went to pieces almost before
it was started, and covered the originators of the
movement with confusion.

The Country Toiler’s Wage.
It is a cold day indeed when the Pastoralists’
Review cannot raise a lament about the shortage
of country labor. In its September issue, the
poor old Review is more than usually puzzled
over the circumstance
It is an unaccountable fact that so many unemployed
exist in Australia while there is so much work to be done.
The cry pervading the rural industries is the scarcity of
labor, while in the cities one of the great problems of the
hour is in connection with the unemployed.
And apparently the questions of wages and hours,
and living conditions, never enter the head of the
Review ; or its alleged fact would not seem nearly
so unaccountable. The rural industries which,
according to the Review, are crying out for labor,
do a fair portion of their crying in the adver-
tising columns of the daily papers, and it invariably
sounds like this :
■VVyANTED, for the country, good man, understands
* ’ horses and double-furrow plough. Wages 20s.
per week and found.
ANTED, dairy-hand. 15s. and found.
TY7ANTED, man for station, must understand sheep.
’ ’ 20s. and found.
The hours aren’t specified, and “ found ” generally
means a, coarse and monotonous diet with an
unduly large proportion of treacle in it, and a
“doss” almost anywhere. In the city, on the
other hand, an ordinarily smart man, if he picks
up a trade, can get from Bs. to 10s. a day; and,
if he is only a pick-and-shovel wielder, he has a fair
chance of 7s. per day. He has no Sunday work,
does only eight hours toil per diem, and usually has
Saturday afternoon off. So when the Review
moans that—
One of the heaviest brakes on the wheels of Australian
development is the scarcity of labor of the right kind,
the Australian working man replies, in effect, that
quite the heaviest brake on the wheels of Australian
country development is the scarcity of wages and hours
and accommodation of the right kind.
If the squatter-friends of the Review, likewise its
farming acquaintances, would agree to pay decent
wages, and to generally improve the conditions of
country labor, there would soon be an end of the
scarcity of “ the right kind of labor;” and some
day very soon, let us hope, Wages Boards will see
that they do these things whether they agree or
not. Shearing, for example, is fairly well paid
for, and there is never any trouble in getting
plenty of good men. They come from far and
near. If anything like the same treatment were
meted out to the average bush worker there would
be such a rush for billets that a considerable
number of squatters and farmers would be trodden
underfoot in the scrimmage unless they got up
trees. When the Commonwealth gets control of
industrial legislation it will certainly pass a law
enforcing fair wages and fair hours and fair
accommodation. Then the rush will set in, and
the land magnate who has cut down all the trees
in his neighborhood will be sorry he was so reck-
less with the timber.
Bogus Subdivision of Big Estates.
Next month, so it is announced, Rupert Clarke,
Victoria’s affluent baronet, will sell 10,000 acres of
land within 16 or 20 miles of Melbourne—land
which has been locked up against settlement ever
since the first beginnings of the hamlet of Bear-
grass, which became Melbourne in course of
time. The land is to be divided into farms of
from 100 to 640 acres, so the proceeding really
looks like a little bit of close settlement. Unfor-
tunately, there is no guarantee at all that it will
be anything of the sort. The Victorian State
Legislature—which, in such matters as this, is
mostly the House of Rich Landlords—is so much
afraid of offending the immense land-shark that it
wouldn’t on any account whatever compel him to
cut up and sell his property in order to make room
for settlers. That is a villainously selfish, yet fairly
understandable attitude. But the State Legislature
goes further than that, and in its desire not to offend
the person (possibly unborn) who may be a stu-
pendous land shark by-and-bye it refuses to do
anything to prevent the aggregation of new big
estates. Therefore when a great landlord sells
10,000 or 20,000 acres in desirable allot-
ments, there is nothing to prevent one person
—who possibly may have 20,000 acres already—
buying all the desirable allotments, in which case,
to all intents and purposes, the land isn’t so much
cut up after it is cut up as it was before it was cut
up. So much of this is done that, though a certain
languid and voluntary process of cutting up has
gone on for 30 or 40 years, the small country land-
holder of Victoria has decreased all the time, and
the big one has increased. If, away back in the
’sixties, the lands of Victoria had been graded
according to their fertility, and it had been decided
what constituted a good living area in each district,
and it had been enacted that no m*n who already
possessed that area should acquire any further
land, also that the man who possessed less than
the specified living area or who possessed no area
at all should not acquire more than the fixed living
area—if that had been done 40 years ago Vic-
toria would now possess a lot of close settlement
that it has missed. If the State even passed
such a law now it would, in a year or
two, have a good deal of close settlement which,
as things are, it doesn’t seem likely to possess till
the Federal progressive land-tax comes along.
The scheme suggested above would certainly be
half-hearted and apologetic, yet even in its half-
hearted way it would do a great deal, and do it
without any new land-tax, or any compulsory
resumption, or any violence done to that sacred
and tremendous joss, the existing landlord. The
result would be that every time a big landlord
wanted money, and sold a few thousand acres of
land to get it, that area of land would
be cut up and sold to small holders, and
it would remain cut up for ever. In many places
even the sale of a 1200-acre farm would be impos-
sible under such a law —the farm would have to be
cut up into four 300-acre farms, and each of them
could be sold only to a person who has, at present,
no farm at all. Perhaps the great but flabby
Bent might be induced to consider this matter.
He is afraid to propose a progressive land-tax lest
he lose his job. He is afraid to propose a system
of compulsory resumption of big estates lest
he lose his job. He is afraid to let things
slide lest he lose his job. He is afraid of the
Country Party and the big landlords on one side,
aijd he is scared to death of the democratic Age
on the other. As a compromise (and he loves
compromises)—also as something to go on with
and as a means of postponing the loss of his
political skin, which will otherwise assuredly be
drying ere long on the Age’s fence — Bent might
try his hand at a measure providing for the limit-
ation of future estates. He couldn't make a
worse mess of it than he did of his Valuation
Bill.
The Case of Flynn.
Paris Nesbit, K.C., of Adelaide, as fair a lawyer
as ever put horsehair on his head, has taken up
the case of Myles Flynn, a prisoner under
sentence of 20 years in S. Australia. Having
petitioned the Governor to re-open the case,
Nesbit has now printed a pamphlet so that the
public may know the facts of the business. The
K.C. never acted for Flynn and doesn’t know
him, but he happened to be in Court while the
case was being tried ; in fact, there were two men
accused, and Nesbit appeared for the other one.
Chief Justice Way tried the case, and when
the jury came out and said that it had
doubts about Flynn, a constable (besides
18 others) having sworn to an alibi, the
Chief Justice remarked that the constable
and the accused were fellow-countrymen. There
wasn’t any evidence on that point; but as the
constable’s front name was Joseph Francis and
the accused’s was Myles, the Chief Justice evi-
dently reckoned that it was safe enough to put
them both down as Irishmen. If, however, an Irish
policeman isn’t to be trusted where another Irish-
man is concerned —and the Chief Justice’s remark
must either have meant that or it was meaning-
less —then what is the Chief Justice doing that he
doesn’t start a crusade for the purifying of the
police force by clearing out every Irishman from it ?
The case, however, does not rest wholly on that
point. There was a cloud of witnesses who spoke
to the same effect as the constable —namely, that
Flynn was miles away from where the highway
robbery was committed when it was committed.
And there are other circumstances in his favor.
Lawson, the other man, swears positively that
Flynn was not his mate. “ I would not
be in the shoes of anyone responsible for
Flynn’s conviction, or, with a knowledge of
the case, for his retention in confinement, for all
the money in the universe,” Paris Nesbit, K.C.,
wrote a year ago; and he is evidently of the same
opinion still. That opinion alone is worth a good
deal; the facts upon which he bases it are worth
more. Thousands of people in the State have a
most uneasy feeling with regard to the case ; and
nothing short of a review of the circumstances
will remove that feeling. Even the possibility of
wounding the keen sensibilities of Chief Justice
Way ought not to be enough to burke that
inquiry. It is better to find out that even the
Chief Justice has erred, and to repair the wrong,
than to feel that he has probably erred and to
refuse to repair the wrong. It is better to be
reminded that even the Chief Justice is human
than to have an uneasy feeling that, rather than
admit it, the State is prepared to shut? up an
innocent man for 20 years.
More Coalition.
William Kidston, Premier of Queensland, went
out and politically hanged himself one day last
week. He may last a long time after being
hanged, but he did the deed none the less. In
other words, he coalesced with the Philp party
the worst affliction and disgrace that ever fell
upon the great northern State —and now presum-
ably its gods will be his and its misdeeds will be
his also. The prospect ahead of the State
looks gloomy. Queensland has got back
to the two-party system, which is the fetich
of the daily press, and Australia’s experi-
ence in the past has been that the two-party
system, when it is arrived at by compromise and
coalition, is a curse which has no redeeming
feature. The Service-Berry and Gillies-
Deakin and Bent-Peacock coalitions in
Victoria produced three Ministries whose
records call aloud for burial. The Parkes-
Robertson and Carruthers-Twaddell coali-
tions in N.S.W. were better, but not much
better. The Stout-Vogel alliance in Maoriland
is still an unpleasant memory. The Griffiiavraith
combination in Queensland buried two political
reputations that had once been great, and the
Mcllwraith-Nelson combine which followed
was almost as bad. When the coalition consists
of two parties with widely-divergent policies, the
result is generally easy to foresee. The Liberal
half of the party prevents the Tory half going in
for actual retrogression—which is a pity, for the
more rapidly it filled up the measure of its iniquity
the sooner would the community be rid of it. The
Tory half prevents the Liberal half making any
progress, and a period of utter legislative stagnation
sets in. Yet the coalition must do something to fill
in time, and the easiest thing is to devise “a
vigorous Public Works policy ” and borrow lots of
money. By sheer bribery and corruption the
coalition keeps in power while the loans last.
Then there is a great smash and a perfume like that
of a long-drowned elephant that has burst; and
at the best there follows a long period of bitter
economy while some patient, indefatigable plodder
of the Turner variety is cleaning up the ruins.
All these wretched shifts and expedients are a
sacrifice to the silly English joss of Party Govern-
ment. If the Ministry were elected by the House
at the beginning of a new Parliament, and held
office for good or evil for the duration of that
Parliament, it really wouldn’t matter whether
there were two parties in the House or twenty.
Coalitions are the fruit of a corrupt tradition
that a House of Parliament should always
be divided into two factions—the one which has
office and doesn’t care how it keeps it, and the
one which hasn’t office and doesn’t care how it
gets it. The new Queensland combine will almost
certainly bury the political reputation of William
Kidston six feet deep ; and it can only be hoped
that it won’t dig up the political reputation of
Robert Philp, for to have that thing above
ground would increase the death-rate. How long
the new arrangement will last is a mere matter of
conjecture. In Victoria, the incapacity of Labor-
leader Prendergast kept the Bent-Peacock
combine in office for quite a while. In N.S.W.,
the incapacity of McGowen keeps the Wade-
Twaddell combine in office. In Queensland, the
impracticability of David Bowman is relied upon
to keep the Kidston-Philp or Philp-Kidston
Ministry, or the Phidston Government or the
Kilp Cabinet —its proper name won’t be known
for certain till we see its first policy statement-
in office. This is the period of unwholesome
coalitions in Australia; three-fourths of the popu-
lation is governed, in a State sense, by them.
Labor leaders of the calibre of Thomas Price
could certainly upset two of them at short notice,
but leaders like Price are rare. Labor, in addi-
tion to having a policy which appeals to its own
direct following, badly wants a policy which will
appeal to a great mass of people outside its own
following. If it declared itself in State politics as
the absolute anti-borrowing party and the con-
sistently pro-Federal and anti-State Frights party
it might scoop in enough new votes to lift it into
office. The public grows scared of loans and tired
of State Frights.

A Freetrade Newspaper, and its
Leathern Hide.
During the last 10 days the allegedly Freetrade
Sydney Telegraph published four column-long
articles demanding Protection —for itself. Some
extracts follow :
Once, not many years ago, the favorite daily occupation
of a section of Federal and State politicians, who for
the time being possessed great power, was to seek means
by which they could attack the more influential portion
of the newspaper press of this State. . . . Privileges held
for nearly 20 years by the press, in common with the
public, of New South Wales were precipitately cut off.
Reduced to simple terms, the above means that
the people’s representatives began to argue, “ not
many years ago,” (1) that if the Telegraph
really thought Freetrade and free competition
the boons it said they were every morning in its
leading columns, it wouldn’t mind a dose of the
boon itself, and (2) that the granting of the said
boon to the Telegraph would save N.S.W. a heap
of money per annum. Having pondered for a
time over these facts, the people's representa*
The Vision From Tsushimo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Last night to me
Came a ghost from out the sea—
Came a spectre from the sand,
And it took me by the hand,
Ere it led
My uneasy spirit forth
To the dead.
Years had gone by
Since I’d laid me down. The sky
Seemed a sky all smeared with blood;
The black, sluggish Harbor flood
Mirrored fire,
And the wounded called to God
From the mire.
Straight to the tide
Led my silent, awful guide,
And he beckoned me to come,
Whilst the tapping of a drum
In the sea
Sounded in my stricken ears
Horribly.
Still played the drum,
As if bidding me to come,
And it called unto my soul
With its stern, insistent roll
Till it said :
“ Haste, O Soul, upon thy way
To the Dead ! ”
Numb —cold and numb—
At the calling of the drum,
Straight I stepped into the sea,
Where there came a dream to me
Of the Lost.
Said the drum : “O Spirit, see !
’Tis the Cost! ”
Deep in the sea
Marched the Men of History,
Steadily as seamen should,
Where each drowned captain stood
By his ship,
With his Russian sword again
At his hip.
Ranged rank on rank,
Where each shattered vessel sank,
Did the sailors take their stand,
Stern and bloodless on the sand
In review ;
And each captain looked upon
His dead crew.
Guns, sunken guns,
Where the Asian current runs,
Dreaming ever ’mid the sand
Of a bright, unguarded land
To the south.
Would that you could boom the word
Mouth by mouth —
That the iron lips of Hell,
With their flame and screaming shell,
Will pronounce a sentence dread
On a careless Nation’s head
Lest we arm.
Would to God that you could crash
That alarm !
Guns, vanquished guns,
As the tide of Mem’ry runs,
Do you dream of sunlit seas
And the smoke that with the breeze
Weaved a pall,
When in insolence you frowned
Down on all ?
With the waning moons and suns
Do you ever dream, O Guns,
Sunk in sleep,
Of the pride that once was yours
Ere you found upon the floors—
On the dark eternal floors
Of the deep—
The grey wisdom of the grave,
Learnt by ghostly king and slave,
Serf and lord,
That the Sword alone can sate
From the Sword.

tives aforesaid decided, with a good deal
of unanimity, to do away with the highly
Protective f ree-earriage-of-N. S. W. -newspapers-
by-the-Government arrangement which the
Telegraph had enjoyed for so many years. Now,
after several years’ experience of its own fiscal
policy, the Telegraph proprietary finds there is
nothing in the Freetrade doctrine—as applied to
itself. It asks that the Blessing shall be taken
away from it. It clamors for Protection against
the S.A. and Victorian and Queensland news-
paper concerns, and for a concession in the nature
of a yearly bonus to enable it to compete at a
huge advantage with the country press of N.S.W.
The Telegraph Go. wants to be “a mushroom
industry.” It hankers to “flourish in the rank
and unnatural atmosphere of Protectionism”;
likewise to be a “hot-house plant,” and “a pri-
vately-owned concern which is bolstered up at the
expense of the general public.” The “ keen, pure
air of Freetrade ” is, in the opinion of the Tele-
graph Co., a good sort of air for other businesses.
For its own part it demands very passion-
ately the thing its leader-writers have been
damning for years past as “ ruinous to enterprise,
self-respect and progress.” And the co. asks
for something more. It pines for the profits (a)
of the country press, (h) of such of the press from
the other States of the Commonwealth as pene-
trates over or comes within the neighborhood of
the N.S.W. borders. Its sternly anti-Socialistic
gorge rises at the reflection that the Socialistic
Railways of N.S.W. don’t provide what it terms
“a readjustment of trains” (which, to employ
simple terms once more, signifies a gratis special
service) in order that it may arrive (free of charge)
at Newcastle, Bathurst, Orange, and other widely-
separated towns in time to greet the folks there
with- their matutinal rasher, and thus cut into the
profits of the N.S.W. papers published in those
towns. Also it wants the State railways to
carry it, and the State employees to handle it
(all free of charge), so that it may strike the dis-
tricts on the Victorian and Queensland borders
before any other newspapers get there. If these
requests are granted, the Telegraph will rest and
be satisfied for a while. And in the intervals of
leaping upon the “ pernicious and insane doctrine
of State Aid,” and “the foolish wickedness of
puffing-up.private industries by legislative inter-
ference,” it will have a kindly word or two for
the administration which is responsible for giving
it Socialism and Protection. It takes an uncom-
promising Freetrade and Anti-Socialist journal of
the Telegraph’s stamp to display such brute
illogicalness and live.

Anti-Sosh and the Fake Thereof.
The Women’s Anti-Sosh Congress, just con-
cluded in Sydney, provided, perhaps, the most
striking instance of the devious methods of the
party that has been put forward for some years.
Fully one-half of the papers read and the
addresses delivered were obviously not composed
by the persons who purported to be the authors,
and had cross-examination been permitted, most
of those who dealt airily with intricate subjects
would have been hopelessly fogged. In one or
two instances, at least, the matter supplied by
one person was delivered by a second, on behalf
of a third, the second being chosen for histrionic
purpqses only. Since its last congress, Anti-Sosh
has learned something, and this time it put its
best ankle forward, in making a glorious dis-
play of feminine loveliness, and the average
session looked like the last lap of a
Beauty Competition, or a Commemoration Day
at Helena Rubinstein’s skin-food college.
Formerly Anti-Sosh women’s congresses were
dreary functions, in which gaunt, elderly females
in ill-fitting clothes droned over confused matters
for hours, mixing up State and Commonwealth
powers, and demanding reforms which were
granted by Edwy about A.D. 435. But all that
has ended. Anti-Sosh to-day is a magnificent
affair in which the elderly, gaunt female is thrust
as far in the background as possible, and the pub-
lic is regaled by an assortment of beauteous dam-
sels as glorious as tight-fitting, skirts and open-
work stockings can make them. Goo-goo eyes of
the most expert type are used for all they are
worth, and the value of casting these occa-
sionally towards the reporters’ table is not
overlooked. Taking it all round, there is
a strong suspicion that the whole affair was
staged-managed by J. C. Williamson. To be a
show girl in the Anti-Sosh theatrical combination
will in a year or two be ranked among the learned
professions, and the illusion will run little chance
of being blown out, so long as the stars of the
Brisbane Congress are drawn from Hobart
and Perth, and so on. Likewise when some
damsel paralyses the Melbourne Congress (run
under expert theatrical management) with her
40in. bosom and her tan stockings and her paper
on “The Effects of Corsets on the Political
Economy of Thibet,” nobody there will guess that
she had stepped right out of a George-street
vaudeville show or a Pitt-street bar. There are
illimitable possibilities in Anti-Sosh if it continues
to follow on these lines, and the Labor party
seems doomed unless it hires Maud Allan and
Pansy Montague to step across and pose in the
interests of Trades Unionism.
The Cow and the Child,
Lately the N.S.W. Public School Teachers’ Asso-
ciation sent out this inquiry to teachers in the
Cow country:—
How many children are considered unfit for instruction
by reason of their dairy work?
By way of a start, it got four replies, giving in-
formation that works out as follows :
Total Number Number
of Unfit for
Scholars Enrolled. Instruction.
1 .. .76 .. 7
2 .. 47 .. 19
3 .. 60 .. 9
* . 58 ..11
Total 241 .. 46
So, in the Cow country one child in every five, or
thereabouts, is pronounced unfit to receive in-
struction because of the excessive physical strain
put upon the baby population in the milking yards
and at the cream separators. Others besides
this 20 per cent, are no doubt subjected to the
same physical strain ; but they don’t show it—
yet. The worst cases, the association is told,
come from the farms worked on the “shares”
system, which means in plain language that it is
in order to provide the landlord with his tribute
that the unfortunate children of the helot are
being turned into something not far removed from
mere brutes, and stunted brutes at that. For
years Australia shied off a problem in relation
to one rural pursuit. It was assured that
without colored labor the sugar-growing business
was impossible. Finally it tackled the trouble
resolutely, having made up its mind that, though
the sugar industry was valuable, a White Aus-
tralia was more valuable still. So the semi-slave
labor of the black and tan had to go; and now
the industry, instead of wilting, thrives as it never
throve before. Something of the same sort will
have to happen with regard to dairy-farming.
The butter industry is valuable, but an enlight-
ened citizenship is more valuable still, and an
enlightened citizenship is out of the question
when such shocking tasks are put upon the grow-
ing child—the citizen of the future —that he is
physically unfit to receive instruction in the
schools. Not enlightenment, but inevitable degra-
dation, lies along that track. If the butter
industry necessarily involves this sort of thing,
then the price is too great, and the butter industry
must go. But the child-slave is no more indis-
pensable to the butter business than the black
slave was indispensable to the sugar busi-
ness. In fact, he or she is wholly super-
fluous at the Cow job. Remove from the
back of the poor little child-slave the land-
octopus, and most of his burden will be gone. In
some cases a parent’s inhumanity and greed may
be responsible for the grinding tasks set upon the
child ; but mostly it is the landlord’s tribute that
drives the whole Cow family to brutalising labor.
Nothing, then, will do much good except reliev-
ing the family of that tribute. The mere exchange
of the Cow-man’s position from tenant to landed
proprietor will do very little good so long as the
capital value of the land is made as high as
rules in most districts to-day. The unfortunate
child can be brutalised just as effectively in the
struggle to pay interest as in the struggle to pay
rent. The whole basis of land values is fictitious,
simply because the supply has been cornered ;
and the State that thinks more of its thousands of
children than of its mere handful of rich men and
the other handful of rich absentees will have to
attack this fictitious state of things with an axe.
For a start, a healthier public sentiment with
regard to land values must be cultivated; and,
instead of the country throwing up its hat at the
sight of its lands mounting up pound by pound in
value, it must be got to regard high values as a
curse, and as merely a means by which those
who own land and money lent on land extort
more from those who use the land. An acre
which has been valued at £lO won’t carry the
fraction of a goat more or grow the fraction of an
oat additional if its value is forced up to £2O or
£4O bvadvertising, booming, and market-trickery;
all that happens is that the owner can extort
twice or four-times as much out of the user,
while if the user buys, and mortgages the
holding in order to do it, he has to pay twice
or four-times as much interest. And in the
struggle to do that his children are condemned to
a slavery which deadens their brains and stunts
their bodies in the appalling manner described in
these school reports.

The Vicissitudes of Adolphus.
The political burlesque that has held the boards
at Melbourne Exhibition Building since July 2of
this year shows signs of drawing to a close.
The public has long since wearied of it, but the
star actor persists in bounding and capering before
empty benches, or to the jeers and scoffs of his
fellow-performers. His latest disaster is the re-
signation of MacKinnon and Peacock the
former allegedly because of the milk-and-watery
nature of the new Land Valuation Bill; the latter
because of ill-health. In Peacock’s case there
was probably the added inducement that a brick
was about to fall, and a brick hurts less if you
are not underneath it. MacKinnon’s case is piti-
ful. He is understood to be a capable, honest man,
with democratic tendencies and a clear perception
of the crying need for a land tax ; yet. though he
was aware of Bent’s notorious shiftiness, he
accepted honorary office under such a leader, and
when his own special piece of work—the Land
Valuation Bill—was disowned and thrown aside,
he still held on while men mocked. But he
speedily found there was no limit to Bent’s
folly, and, finally, he threw it up in disgust. Had
he grasped the chance when it came he might
have been State Premier within a week, with a
fair following and the friendly neutrality, if not
the cordial co-operation, of the Labor party. Now
he has to win his way again. As for Adolphus,
his political days are numbered. Whether he
survives his present troubles or not he is im-
possible any longer. His public gambollings and
prancings fail to amuse ; his promises no longer
distract; his muzzling of possible competitors or
opponents disgusts; his inaccuracies weary.
Even his comic songs are no longer taken seri-
ously, He used to be tolerated because his finan-
cial policy worked out in a fairly-satisfactory
way ; yet there has been a good deal of juggling
even about that. He wasn’t content to appear to
be doing fairly well; he must pretend to be doing
vastly better. And of late his financial policy
seems to have gone to the dogs. In practically
everything apart from finance, Bent hasn’t had
even the merit of doing fairly well; yet he has
pulled through by intrigue and make-believe,
often-times of a shameful character; and Victoria
can put up with the discreditable pretence no
longer. The career of Adolphus lies behind
him ; and the sooner Victoria bangs the door the
better for what little self-respect the Assembly
has left.

Cablegrams from England.
The amazing industrial and commercial downfall
in England suggests that the bottom is falling out
of Freetrade very suddenly at last. Among the
things reported are these :
(1) British trade, during the first eight months of 1908,
was £72,000,000 less than for the first eight months of
1907.
(2) Coal exports increased by £2,000,000 (otherwise the
slump in trade would have been £2,000,000 greater than
it was). The increase in the export of coal simply meant
a tendency backward towards the status of a primitive
community which supplies raw material for the use of
more progressive manufacturing States.
(3) Wages paid in Britain for the first eight months of
1908 were £15,000,000 less than in the corresponding
period of 1907. Some estimates make the slump even
worse.
(4) The number of unemployed among trades-unionists
rose to an estimated 10 per cent.
(5) The total number of male unemployed was esti-
mated at 645,000.
(6) A hunger strike reported in London. A hunger
strike seems to be a device whereby a multitude of men
decide to sit down in a public place and there die slowly
of starvation in order to draw public attention to their
misery. The police broke up the hunger strike.
(7) The hop industry having been practically ruined by
unrestricted foreign competition, the hop-workers organ-
ised processions through England to draw attention to
their wretchedness.
(8) Tremendous downfall in shipbuilding. One great
shipbuilding firm, with £2,000,000 worth of plant and
machinery, was reported as not having a single order—
not even an order for a punt or a skiff—on hand.
(9) E. Smith, a member of the London County Council,
urged that body to try to find work for the unemployed.
The starving multitude in the gallery cried “We are
hungry.” Police were sent for to remove Smith. Tre-
mendous struggle with Smith—who seems to be a good
fighter.
(10) Orders given in haste for the building of new war-
ships to find work for the unemployed.
(11) Offer made to take large number of unemployed
into the army, and give them food and a trifle of pay while
doing military manoeuvres.
(12) Mr. Burns, president of the Local Government
Board, said that within the next few months it would be
necessary to spend more in charitable relief than was
spent during the whole period of the Lancashire cotton
famine of the American Civil War days. He added that
no legislation to deal with lack of employment would be
introduced this year.
(13) The same John Burns reckoned that the job of
dealing with the question of poverty and distress will
probably occupy 100 years. And if Freetrade lasts, it is
more likely to occupy 1000 years. Meanwhile, the beef
and soup that are 100 years off look very remote.
(14) Thorne, M.P., having lost his head at the sight
of the distress which Freetrade seems powerless to
remedy, urged the unemployed to rush the bakers’ shops
and get bread anyhow. A summons was issued against
Thorne, M.P.
(15) Grayson, M.P., was hauled out of the House of
Commons by the Sergeant-at-Arms for growing excited
over the sufferings of the unemployed.
(16) Verdict of coroner’s jury, “death from lack of
nourishment,” or words to that effect, growing un-
pleasantly frequent.
(17) Numerous by-elections ; Tariff-reformers returned,
as a general thing.
The explanation of it all seems to be that the
growth of manufactures in the great Protectionist
countries, such as the United States, Germany,
France, Russia, etc., has at last put the world’s
supply ahead of the world’s demand. That pro-
duces a curious state of affairs. In the United
States, Germany, France and Russia the producer
has his local market secured to him by Protection,
and he has in addition as much of the outside
market as he can get hold of. But the British
producer hasn’t got his local market secured to
him by Protection ; he has just as much of the
British market as he can get in competition with
all the world and just as much of the outside
market as he can get in competition with all the
world. So when supply gets ahead of demand all
the world over, it is a cold day for Bull,, and but
for the fact that a number of his colonies and
foreign possessions give him a preference in
defiance of all the doctrines of Freetrade, the day
would be a shade colder than it is. Meanwhile,
as a side issue of the case, the anti-Defence crowd
in Australia might ask itself if it isn’t a low-down
thing to rely on a nation which has struck such a
patch of ill-luck as this to supply most of the men,
money, ships and naval capacity for the protection
of Australia.

This letter comes to hand from Melbourne :
The Editor Bulletin. —ln your issue of this week there
appears a paragraph supposed to emanate from a well-
informed source. From first to last the paragraph is a
tissue of misstatements. John Wren bad no more to do
with the Carlton selection than yourself. In the first
place both the president and secretary of the Carlton
Branch of the P.L.C. were candidates for selection—both
popular officers. The selection body, consisting of mem-
bers of the Carlton Branch of the P.L.C. who were
financial members of not less than three months’
standing and all affiliated unionists residing in the
electorate with a similar qualification, gave Solly
an absolute majority on the first count, the selec-
tion being presided over by two specially ap-
pointed officers of the Central Executive, and I have
not heard one word of adverse comment regarding same
from any candidate or his supporters. As regards John
Wren’s participation in the selection, or the subsequent
fight which ended so gloriously on Friday last, it is too
absurd to seriously consider. I have never had the honor
of even speaking to John Wren in my life, but I am sure,
judging from what I have heard of the man, that we
would not have been put to such sore straits to finance the
campaign if he was personally interested in the struggle.
As regards Mr. Wren’s nominating Mr. David Gaunson,
he may have done so for aught I know to the contrary or
care. All Ido know is that Mr. Gaunson was the first to
announce his candidature, and that before even the
Labor selection was made. If your correspondent was so
well-informed as he pretends to be regarding Labor
politics in Victoria, he would know- that there is no
chance for members of a two-up school or anybody out-
side the ranks of organised labor to participate in the
selection of a Labor candidate ; but probably the whole
effusion is prompted by the working of an evil mind ever
ready to cry stinking fish and injure the movement,
which, however, is proof ag-ainst any such attacks.
C. J. Buckley, Secretary Carlton Branch Political
Labor Council.
James A. S. Brown, Returning Officer at Selection.
In reply to which The Bulletin’s correspondent
didn’t profess that John Wren went to the meet-
ing and openly nominated Mr. Solly, any more
than he professed that a Standard Oil Trust mag-
nate would be seen openly influencing a U.S.
politician in the public street in the middle
of the day. But most probably he, like
many other men, strongly believes that the
Victorian Labor party has got into a
state of general subservience to Wren, which
made the fact that Mr. Solly was, or was reputed
to be. the friend of that awful alleged “Demo-
crat ” a big influence in his favor. And the tone
of admiration in which the above letter alludes to
the ex-tote-shopkeeper doesn’t tend to dispel
ideas of that kind. The writers regard it as an
“ honor ” to speak to Wren.

The latest developments of. the Smith-Lyne pro-
blem are interesting. Miss Grace Watson, the
very remarkable lady who seems to boss the
incoherent league of female Anti-Socialists,
alleged publicly that she and a Mrs. Smith once
called on Treasurer Lyne, and that that rude,
discourteous man coarsely addressed the lady over
and over again as just “Smith.” Lyne denied
the charge, and telegraphed to Miss Watson for
particulars. He got no answer at all from the
highly-discourteous lady, but later she made a
statement to a Sydney daily paper to the effect
that she hadn’t, like William Lyne, the Common-
wealth Treasury behind her out of which to pay
for her private telegrams, so she had to
reply through the press. The veiled sugges-
tion that Lyne annexed public funds with
which to pay for his private telegrams
looked a fairly mean business, and the
hint that Miss Watson, who apparently could
afford to live at one of the most expensive
hotels in Sydney, was only debarred from tele-
graphing full particulars of “Mrs. Smith”
through lack of the needful shilling or so, looked
ridiculous. Possibly it was also the want of the
necessary 2d. which prevented the lady sending
Lyne full particulars of Mrs. Smith by letter, and
possibly it was simply the want of Mrs. Smith
that prevented her giving full particulars to the
press when she had the loan of the ear of that in-
stitution gratis. Finally the S. M. Herald broke
ground in a new place with this paragraph :
The little controversy between Miss Grace Watson and
Mr. Lyne has entered another stage. Miss Watson has
given to us IN CONFIDENCE the name and address of the
lady who was addressed as plain “ Smith ” by the Minister,
and she is quite prepared to take the matter further if he
desires it. The charge of discourtesy is not only re-
peated but amplified, and the evidence bearing upon it
should be interesting if Mr. Lyne presses his contention
to a vigorous conclusion. We understand that the name
and address of “ Mrs. Smith"’ have been also given. in con-
fidence to the Melbourne Argus.
Miss Watson, it seems, is “quite prepared to take
the matter further ” if Lyne desires it, but all the
demands of Lyne that it should be taken further
evoked no response. And now it seems she has
furnished the name of Mrs. Smith to the Herald
“in confidence.” Why furnish the name as a dark
secret when she has already said the name is
Smith ? All this delay is calculated to rouse
suspicion. If Mrs. Smith had been produced at
once people might have believed in her. If she is
only dragged to light after long delay, there are
debased characters who will say that there has
been time enough to hunt up a person of loose
veracity who will say she is the Mrs. Smith in
question. And it isn’t advisable to give a handle
to debased characters like that.
—♦
The State Rights person has at least one consola-
tion amid all his woes ; and when the High Court
unanimously decided that the Deakin Govern-
ment was right about the Surplus Revenue Bill,
and that all the State Frights were wrong.
N.S.W. Premier Wade, on behalf of himself and
Bent and Evans and the rest, trotted out the
ancient political dope once more :
The framers of the Constitution, and those who voted
for Federation, I am sure, never contemplated such a pos-
sibility.
They must have been a deep-thinking lot, the
377,988 people who voted for the Federal Con-
stitution. According to Carruthers and Wade
and Bent and Newton Moore and the other
small local fry, these people looked ahead, and
foresaw everything, and contemplated everything,
and always they contemplated the way the State
Fright crowd contemplates. On every point,
from the wire netting steal to the attempt to
leave the Commonwealth with no money for
Defence and other urgent purposes, the defeated
anti-Australian finds consolation in saying that
anyhow the people who voted for Federation
thought the way he does. But though these
377,988 people are still mostly alive and able to
show their views by driving Deakin and Lyne
into oblivion they remain torpid. They take no
notice when Wade is so kind as to tell them
exactly what views the whole 377,988 of them held
nine or ten years ago. It is good of Wade; or
possibly it is darned impudent of Wade, but
anyhow nobody pays any attention.
Said Sydney Telegraph in a frenzied article
(22/10/’08) dealing with Reid’s recent censure
fiasco :
But when a leader is handicapped because he repre-
sents the dominant sentiment of the leading State in the
Union, as Mr. Reid undoubtedly is, it becomes time to
ask what Federation is supposed to mean. Even the few
DKAKiN-ites that are to be found in this city make ani-
mosity to New South Wales the test of what they are
pleased to represent as the true Federal spirit. In any
question between this State and the Commonwealth, or
this State and any other State, they assume that New
South Wales must be wrong, and for it to assert the
rights guaranteed to it by the Constitution is to provoke
sneers and sarcasms.
In another column of the identical issue in which
the above appears are the division lists of the
motion referred to. An analysis of them shows
that, taking N.S.W. members only, the voting
was as follows
For Reid’s motion (including pairs) .. .. 11
N.S.W. members against Reid’s motion .. .. 15
Thus there was a majority of four N.S.W. repre-
sentatives against the motion which the Tele-
graph avers was opposed out of hatred for
N.S.W., and against the man whom it had the
brassy “front ” to put forth as “representing the
dominant sentiment of the leading State.” Re-
gard the case another way. Of those who sup-
ported Reid (of N. SW.),
The members representing other States totalled.. 14
The N.S.W. members who were for him totalled.. 11
So that not only did a majority of N.S.W. repre-
sentatives vote against N.S.W. Reid, but Reid (of
N.S.W.) received more assistance from members
of other States than from his own ! What is the
basis, then, of the Telegraph’s new Ma State
grievance ?
The man far out is a good, reliable democrat all
the time. As a case in point, the local branch of
the Amalgamated Workers’ Association of Wes-
tralia at Barrambie sends a cheque for £lO 10s.,
and 3s. to cover exchange, as its contribution
towards the Kingston Memorial Fund. ' The
population of Barrambie is only about 50 men,
women and children all counted (dogs are extra)—
so the local membership of the A. W. A. must be
almost infinitesimal and the subscription per head
is very large. The Gazetteer says, briefly, that
Barrambie is 670 miles north of Pertly which
seems to imply that it is almost on the Edge of
All Things, and it can’t be found on any map in
this office. Kingston didn’t belong to the same
State as these Barrambie pioneers ; in all proba-

bility hardly any of them ever saw him ; and,
moreover, he is dead, and it is wonderful how
soon dead men are forgotten in a general
way. This subscription goes to show three
things in particular : (1) That the Labor man is the
most generous person in the community when an
occasion turns up which is worth being generous
about. (2) That he doesn’t bury his friends so
deep as most men do. Even the fact that Kingston
was so completely incapacitated for years before
his death that he couldn’t so much as crawl to
Parliament House to put in a word for the
Democratic cause which he had so much at heart,
hasn’t made his friends forget him. And (3) it
shows that the Labor man is the real Large Aus-
tralian, who takes no account of State prejudices
and State limitations, and to whom a good Aus-
tralian is a good Australian whether he comes
from Hobart or Port Darwin. The Bulletin
sends a friendly greeting to the A.W.A. at Bar-
rambie, and has sent out for a new map with that
little township on it. A place like that ought to
be on the map even if it had a population of only
20 instead of 50.

Coming so soon after the Women’s Anti-
Socialist Conference, “Diana of Dobson’s” (at
Sydney Royal) produces a distinct shock. It is a
shamelessly frank argument on behalf of a mini-
mum wage and industrial legislation generally.
Ten years ago the heroine of it would have been
hissed, as an Anarchist, from the boards of any
theatre frequented by the well-to-do classes; at the
least she is, undoubtedly, what the modern Con-
ferencer would call a “Socialist.” “Diana of
Dobson’s ” is a deadly shaft directed at those who
cling to the idea that the United Kingdom is a
bearable, much less a pleasant, place for the work-
seeker. This play, written by a Londoner, and
accepted by British critics as a faithful reflection
of contemporary industrial conditions, establishes
the amazing fact that a young, healthy, edu-
cated, and sober man, with no “encum-
brances,” and all the will in the world to
work, is liable in the Cold Country to starve to
death. The playwright would have adhered more
closely to the eternal verities had he made his toil-
seeking hero something other than an ex-Guards-
man and a cadet of a noble family. The half-
penny press of London constitutes itself a special
providence for the purpose of shepherding originals
of rank when they go forth on the trail of manual
toil. In real life Captain the Hon. Victor
Bretherton would not have been more than an
hour pursuing a pick and shovel job ere the Daily
Mail would have had a scare-headed account of
the phenomenon “set up” for next morning’s
paper. Thereafter offers of music-hall engage-
ments and lecturing tours would have rained on
the Captain like golden bricks, and he would have
left his bench on the Embankment for a bed at
Claridge’s. Diana’s lover should have been repre-
sented as the offspring of a moderately prosperous
member of the middling classes. Then the re-
sulting happenings would have followed quite
naturally.
* * * *
Diana is an employee at Dobson’s, a big
London millinery establishment. She has been
there for six years when the play opens, and by
strict attention to duty has achieved an income of
ss. a week, less deductions. The other young
ladies in the employ of Dobson also draw ss. a
week—when they don’t draw 3s. or 2s. 6d. They
are more or less satisfied with their lot. Not so
Diana. She cherishes no gratitude towards Dob-
son ; in fact, she despises and reviles him. She
says things about Dobson’s business methods
that are calculated to make the worthy folk
who yearn to see the working-classes “ keep in
their place,” and desist from selfish clamorings
fora “ living wage,” shudder disgustedly. Sud-
denly Diana learns that she has been left a legacy
of £3OO. Forthwith she goes “fanti.” She ad-
dresses painful truths to Miss Pringle, forewoman,
and decides to repay herself for the penury and
joylessness of her girlhood with one whole month
of gay, well-fed, decently-frocked Life. So she
goes to Pontresina, in the Swiss Engadine, and
there meets Bretherton and his match-making
aunt; and one Grinley, a loathly knight who is
in the same line of business as Dobson. Both
Grinley and Bretherton propose to her under the
delusion that she is a wealthy widow. Grinley
she rejects with contumely, to the delight of the
audience (his Private Enterprise principles and
practices have rendered him abhorrent to the
latter); but Bretherton has won her heart, and so,
womanlike, she tells him her life-story. It is a
severe shock to Bretherton, and, in the anguish of
the moment, he does not behave as well as he
might. Diana accuses him of fortune-hunting,
and taunts him with his worthlessness and
incapacity. The last act reveals Brether-
ton striving to earn a crust by the labor
of his own unassisted hands. He has not taken
to work-hunting of necessity (he has £6OO a year
of his own), but for the sake of his self-respect.
He wants to see whether he is really the econonii-
-eally valueless unit Diana said he was. He is in
the act of finding that she spoke sooth when the
lady herself happens along—also destitute —and
the two make it up and “return to civilisation,”
to live on Bretherton’s income.
* * * •
The part of Diana, disillusioned shop-
lady, fits Tittell Brune like a glove. This actress
does not handle stage nuances over-convincingly,
but in the portrayal of the honest, slightly
humorless type of young person, with the mini-
mum of “nonsense” about her, she is in her
element. And so her Diana is a joyous and life-
like study. Thomas Kingston presents a Captain
Bretherton who improves as he goes on. The
genuine Guardsman who took to walking with an
aggressive stoop, and arms violently waggling and
squared at an unnatural angle, and who in other
respects comported himself like a newly-fledged
remittance man, would be “ragged’’out of his
regiment before he attained to a captaincy. The
Bretherton of Kingston did things in Act 11. on
last Saturday night that would have driven his
brother-officers —had he ever possessed any—to
put jam or treacle on his beautiful hair. But as
the play wears on, Bretherton’s exasperating
“ lift ” wears off, and he becomes a natural and
attractive young man. Gregan MacMahon’s Sir
Jabez Grinley is a vulgarly unpleasant trader of
the conventional sort; and Mrs. Brough supplies
an artistic portrait of a match-making aunt. The
staging and mounting are excellent.

By “10-2-4” :
Both the Sydney dailies agree in greeting “Diana of
Dobson’s,” the new Theatre Royal production, with the
faintest praise possible considering that the show is
numbered among the “ good advertisers.” Said the S.M.
Herald (26/ll)/’08)
“For the cause of its very phenomenal success in
London one would be inclined to look to the audacity
of the first scene.”
This is tantamount to saying that London audiences
are so prurient that they would flock for months to a
play that showed a few young women in a dormitory.
The Telegraph reckons that audiences don’t like to hear
“didactic deliverances on the injustice of social conditions
and the tyrannies of sweating employers,” and it considers
Diana a “small-minded person.” Wherefore this thusness?
The explanation is simple. Diana is a breathing, moving
and speaking tract in advocacy of Sosh. She is a live
woman, taken out of a world where industrial legislation
of the sort the local Anti-Soshite denounces as “in-
famous ” and “ anarchistic ” has not yet fully penetrated,
and is presented before the eyes of people who can only
think when they are faced with object lessons. Diana’s
dreary lot is calculated to make folks sympathise with
the sweated shop-girl, though they never gave that luck-
less young person’s existence a thought before. And the
path between sympathy for the sweated and approval of
what the Herald and Telegraph denounce as Sosh is
very short. No, it is not surprising that the Anti-Sosh
papers decry “ Diana of Dobson’s’’ somewhat.'

Two of the Cherniavskis are ‘ * dear little
fellows” and the third is “a fine youth.” The
youngest is 12, the eldest is 17. In point of
numbers the appallingly-musical family of Cherni-
avski is like most of the Russian Hebrew families
that have been chivvied out of Czardom. There are
grown men and women and babes in arms in these
families, and the units all seem capable of acquiring
wads of academic paper or of mastering any musical
instrument. The baby of the Cherniavski tribe,
aged two years, tears off her bib with rage and
throws her “ comforter ” at her astounded family
when one of her 12 (or 15) brothers and sisters
plays half a tone flat in the domestic symphony.
A babe like that must be a great joy to a chivvied
family !
A Grand Piano Underneath the Bough,
A Gramaphone, a Chinese Gong, and Thou (Baby)
Trying to Sing an Anthem off the Key—
Oh, Paradise were Wilderness Enow !
The Russian Yid baby, instead of getting appen-
dicitis, gets Tschaikowskyitis. Then it goes on a
tour as a wonder child, and later settles down as
a great teacher. The three Cherniavskis brought
here by Mr. Edward Branscombe, and now
appearing at Sydney Town Hall, are startlingly
ahead of their ages in their management of their
respective instruments —violin, ’cello and piano.
The pianist—he is thirteen years young—is the
best of the bunch. He and his twelve-year-old
brother wear wide white collars, knickers, and
Paderewski hair that has surely been tongsed.
All the motherly hearts in the audience went out
to the white-collared pair. Mrs. Marie Hooton,
a pleasant contralto with an attractive platform
manner and appearance, and Mr. Percival
Driver’s baritone enlivened the programme.

“The Belle of Mayfair” and her entour-
age at Sydney Cri. abandoned London W. on
Tuesday night, and are now putting in an all too
brief Wednesday-to-Friday at The Hook of Hol-
land. The maidens and their attendant cavaliers,
bloques, etc., do much the same things when they
are in Holland as they do when they are in Mayfair,
but they perform their feats so prettily that it is
worth journeying even that long distance to view
them. On Sunday they leave the Hook for the
city where the Wrongs come from, andtheMaState
is getting her hankies back from the wash accord-
ingly, and making preparations for a perfect gust
of sobs and misery.

“The Merry Widow” is coining just as
much money for J. C. Williamson now as it did
in its first week at Her Majesty’s (Sydney); it’s a
very slack night when everybody who wants to
get in can find enough room even for a hang-over.
Carrie Moore finishes her share of the business on
Friday ; then Miss Ohls arrives and wears the
gay weeds in the other’s place—wears them for
three weeks or more. By that time Margaret
Anglin will be back with something more ambi-
tious than Sydney has yet seen her in ; but which
of the Williamson houses will put her up hasn’t
yet been finally announced.

Johnson, the Banger, shows his muscles
working under a skin that shines as brown satin.
Then he rains blows on a harmless ball and anon
he spars with a curate-like trainer. All this goes
on at the Sydney Glaciarium, where West’s
Pictures take the eyes of large audiences. The
recent great R.C. procession, which intended to be
Eucharistic and caused such alarms and excursions
amongst those of other faiths in London, is filmed,
and shows a colossal caterpillar of humans boring
its way through dense swarms of onlookers.
Humorous pictures are interspersed just to keep
the corners of the aggregate public mouth turned
up.

“ Two Little Sailor Boys ” will occupy the
heaving deck of Sydney Palace for the last time on
Friday night. On Saturday Jo Smith’s Aus-
tralian drama, “A Miner’s Trust,” will be paid
over the footlights to an expectant audience.
The play deals with the old “digging” days
when our forefathers didn’t seek their fortunes
clad in red Crimean shirts, but in any old shirts
that came handy, and when the bullock dray
sped through the land like a demented snail.

At Sydney Lyceum Mr. Spencer lias
rushed backward per flickergraph across the
wastes of Time to the days of the Yankee Civil
War. Then he hustles to England, where the
great Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes slides
down the stocks into the water, and shows the
grim outlines of the most powerful war machine
afloat on the seven seas. Then away to Constan-
tinople, when the city of the Sultan is a mass of
flame, and the pariah dogs, Turks, Armenians,
Greeks, and other wild animals fly in silent but
realistic terror before the conflagration. Stam-
boul being switched off, the audience finds
itself running lightly through Paris and paus-
ing for drinks at each place of historic
interest, and thence to the winter sports at Lyons.
The world spins round, and the gazer is back in the
Triassic period among the haunts of Pre-Adamite
man. The microscope having been comman-
deered, the balancing evolutions of the ordinary
blue-bottle fly prove that undesirable insect to be
a balancer and tight-rope walker of parts and high
degree. The moving picture has become an in-
stitution, and threatens to play a leading part in
education and the dissemination of news. In the
adjacent future nobody will buy the daily news-
paper. He will just wander into the daily cine-
matograph hall and see what has occurred.

The Bulletin paid its weekly visit of
inspection to Sydney Tivoli the other evening,
and made the acquaintance of Duncan’s Scotch
Collies—some 11 dog-humorists with beautiful coats
and tails like expensive ostrich feathers. They
skip and jump in an accomplished manner, and
one pup even somersaults ; but they are most im-
pressive as musicians and actors. Seated on
chairs, behind small harmoniums, they play care-
fully with their paws “The Blue Bells of Scot-
land.” The somersaulting pup has to paw the
last note of the melody, and the thoughtful way
it eyes its instrument before it gently presses the
keyboard is a joy to witness. The same dog plays
the part of the chauffeur in a motor-car tragedy,
and when something bursts with a loud report it
jumps off the seat and crawls underneath the car
quicker than the average motorist. The other
big turns of the show are the three McGregors,
Osborn and Brooks, Abdullah’s Arabs, Barnard’s
dolls, Ted Kalman, Fanny Powers, and the four
Rosebuds. At Saturday’s matinee J. W. Rickaby,
a comedian from London, and Frank and Jean
Latona, from Noo Yark, will face the Tivoli
music for the first time.

Perhaps the point most really remarkable
in “ The Red Mill,” which has had a triumphant
week at Adelaide Royal, is the way in which
Sherras and Miss Olive Godwin take as merely
mature sentimentalists two parts which were
clearly written as elderly absurdities. Still their
singing would easily condone a much bigger crime.
Singing is not the strong point of theco,; dancing
is. Miss Fan Dango floats, and Ford and Leslie
flounder and fall and flop all over the place. It is
the first time Leslie has had the chance really to
dominate a stage, and he fully holds his own with
the amazingly agile Ford. For “ The Prince of
Pilsen ” the co. is strengthened by the dropping
in of Myles Clifton and Miss Ada Murphy, but
the stay of the Prince of the place the beer is
named after is to be very brief. At the Town
Hall, the Welshmen, making heavy play with
hymn tunes, have gone out with a blaze of piety
and national enthusiasm.

To-nighfc (Thursday) is the concluding
“ Twelfth Night ” at Her Majesty’s, and the end
of Miss Margaret Anglin’s season in Melbourne.
The revival of “Twelfth Night” was a happy
managerial thought. The house was crowded,
and the multitude appeared to find more pleasure
in this fairly-good performance of the ancient
comedy than it would have been likely to get from
another presentation of the leading lady in a
modern emotional drama of unreal life. To them
who take their Immortal William very seriously,
the present revival may have seemed wanting
in traditional Shakspearian manner. From the
general point of view, it was none the worse for
being nothing to rave about. No part of the per-
formance emphasised the inferiority of other por-
tions. It had its tit-bits and prime cuts, but, on
the whole, the joint was consistently underdone.
AT WIRTH’S CIRCUS.
BABY PASTORE
AND HIS LITTLE
BROTHER.
Viola, as personified by Miss Anglin, is
every inch a girl, and a frankly feminine young
spinster at that. If she fell in love with the languid
nobleman who sent her with messages of hopeless
passion to the other girl, Miss Anglin didn’t let
the audience see her falling. She concealed her
feelings underagirlv demeanor, and one thought of
her as being dressed up in boys’ clothes for a lark.
She was more charming and light-hearted than
some previous Violas, yet even less convincing
than most of them. Her “ disguise ” offered the
Duke Orsino and the Countess Olivia no possible
excuse for not seeing through it at a first glance.
Also her twin brother resembled her in about the
same degree that a stale potato resembles a fresh
apple. Consequently when the Countess insisted on
a sudden marriage with the male twin, the
audience reckoned she had discovered that
he wasn’t his sister. Miss Alma Vaughan
played Olivia with quiet effectiveness and a fine
pair of eyes. Toby Belch and Aguecheek (Fitz-
gerald and Stirling) avoided exaggeration as a
rule, and missed the full force of their characters
all the time, but in several respects they were
stronger than their colleagues in the broad-comedy
department. Dion Titheradge, youthful and un-
furnished in his clowning, partly redeemed his
failure with a pleasant singing voice that came
in useful at the end ; whilst Miss Susie
Vaughan’s conception of Maria was unsatisfac-
tory every way. In George Titheradge’s
realistic performance of Malvolio, the stiff-backed
steward, the one thing lacking was the pompous
personality that should go to justify the victim-
ising of him. He seemed insufficiently offensive.
He was fairly inside his character, but he didn’t
make it large enough. All the same, the fine
quality of his humor was a revelation to people
who had seen Malvolio’s vanity buffooned in
previous productions of “ Twelfth Night,” on the
same stage and at the Princess'.-!. Kolker, as
Orsino, was almost as picturesque as the scenery,
which earned sundry bursts of applause.
* * *
On Friday night the Dramatic Fund is to
get an interesting benefit at Her Majesty’s. The
Savage Club has undertaken a production of
“Society,” and the brightest of the club’s ama-
teur talent, assisted by the arts and graces of its
lady relatives and friends, will appear in one con-
secutive performance of Robertson’s comedy.
On Saturday comes Julius Knight in “The
Scarlet Pimpernel,” for the first time in Mel-
bourne. Miss Ola Humphrey and a William-
sonian company will be associated with the long-
lost Julius on this occasion, and the box-plan is
being ticked off with appropriate eagerness.
** * *
The tail end of the ballad-opera season at
Melbourne Royal looks somewhat limp and des-
pondent. Last week “The Bohemian Girl” was
staged with so much ill-success that two important
changes in the lady portion of the cast were
promptly announced. The bill for Wednesday
was “Les Cloches,” with Miss Stella Gastelle to
the fore; and, for the last two nights of the
season, “ Maritanathe “East Lynne” of the
lyric stage—is to resume duty. After which, on
Saturday, Miss Madge Mclntosh, Harcourt
Beatty, Gaston Mervale, and the rest of the
company which played in lurid drama at the
Royal long months ago, will reappear, clothed in
18th century costumes and in their right minds,
to play “She Stoops to Conquer.” Recent re-
vivals of Shakspeare are believed to have cleared
the Melbourne air and created a demand for such
intellectual matter as “She Stoops” and other
old-established comedies. Anyhow, Melbourne
is to have a series of them during the next seven
weeks.
** * *
At Melbourne Olympia, on Saturday night,
T. J. West crowded in his usual momentous
assortment of pictorial facts and fatuities. Of his
array, “ Paris from a Balloon,” was interesting,
in that it showed how little —bar Paradise and
Gehenna—is safe from the inquisitive picturo-
grapher. As for the film, it spread out that
essentially frivolous village in a queer plan—inter-
sected by streaks of roadway; punctuated by
parks, houses, chimneys, and etceteras; and freely
dotted with insignificant specks, which were
vehicles and humans. Another picture professed
to reveal how Mr. Burns and Mr. Johnson train
for their pugilistic encounters. If the film could
have possibly exhibited them training for news-
paper interviews, the audience would have been
stunned by their stamina.
** * *
“ Human Nature ” is progressing favorably
at Melbourne King’s. Nell Temple—served up
with panting majesty by Miss Duggan—continues
to rescue her unutterable Fwankie from the paws
of the baby planters, and that more matured
nipper, Dick, despite his growing delirium, still
has the gumption to throw his seven in about 79
agonising positions. Moreover, Laurence Dunbar,
who is always so languid, lanky and select, has
added to his aesthetic suitings and affluent
moustache a whole wad of Imperial chin
whisker, and has all the solemnity of newness.
“Human Nature ” is a weird medley of novelties.
However, to-morrow (Friday) evening sees its
finish, and Saturday is to witness a revival of
“The Midnight Mail,” on the usual completeseale,
at three, two, and one.
Who says there are no Australian drama-
tists? One of them, who calls himself “Karta”
on his programme because his name is Carter,
has accomplished six pieces for the stage—
melodrama, two dramas without the melo, a
dramatette and a comedy, exclusive of his
latest effort, which is seemingly a dramaling.
This was performed to a packed audience of
admiring friends at Furlong’s room, Royal
Arcade (Melb.), the other night. Its title
is “Destructo, ” and the story (in one
solitary act) deals with the invention, by
a military person, of a terrible explosive
which plays the name-part. One of the
amateurs concerned in this serio-comic
entertainment was Mrs. Maurice Dudley,
whose clever acting would be certain to cover
a multitude of sins.
The Baines’ troupe of one star and about
a dozen assorted starlets having clattered out of
Melbourne Bijou, that playhouse reopens on
Saturday night with Edwin Geach’s co. in “ The
Woman Pays.” According to preliminary an-
nouncements, the play solves the great i human
problem : “Is Marriage a Failure?”
* *
At Melbourne Princess’s, closed since the
death of Herbert Flemming, the spry and tuneful
folk who ran “The Red Mill ” a while ago will
reappear on Saturday in “ The Prince of Pilsen.”
Melbourne has not yet seen the potentate in ques-
tion, but his principality is associated in the
public mind with lager bier, and a refreshing
musical outbreak is expected.
*K- * * *
Ada Crossley returns to Melbourne on
Saturday (which happens to be Derby Day) for the
purpose of singing in “ Elijah,’’ at the Town Hall.
Thenewly-formed Vic. Festival Choral Society will
provide the chorus for “Elijah,” and a professional
orchestra will have Leon Sametini for its leader
on this soulful occasion. On Cup night and the
following afternoon Ada Crossley and the co.
give farewell concerts before making for Ade-
laide and the West.
* *■ *
At Princes Court, which is nowadays
Wirths’ Park, the circus and menagerie of those
distinguished landowners will rage and roar until
further notice. An exhaustive appreciation of
the circus appeared in last Bulletin. There
is nothing new to remark about the
Wirthian enterprise this week, except that
the odor of menagerie no longer penetrates
to the place where the -elephants gambol
together and the clowns mingle their little
jokes. The lion, the unicorn and kindred beasts
of prey have their cages in the open since they
were domiciled in the Park. Fresh air from
Heaven blows cool upon their fevered tails.
When the leopard puts his chin into the sawdust
and glances stealthily upward through the bars of
his prison he can sometimes see the Southern Cross.
Under these cooler conditions the polar bear is
recovering his appetite, and if the management
were to provide him with a pailful of iced drink the
animal would probably feel almost happy.
** * *
The company at Melbourne Opera House
has lost the Stavordale Quartet and found Burt
Shepard since last Bulletin. Otherwise the
only difference in the programme is the mention
of last nights as regards Mignonette and the
Baboons. The length of their lastness is not
stated.

IN TROUBLE.
Five thousand foot police and 200 mounted men
guarded the precincts of Parliament House, London, to
prevent a suffragette rush. — Cablegram.
MEMBER OF HOUSE OF C OMMONS: “ Why, it’s just
as if we was the Czar!”
The barque Fifeshire sailed out of New-
castle (N.S.W.) with a cargo of coal, and fled
2500 miles over the ocean until it found a nice,
comfortable reef. Then it sat down with a bump
and the crew took to the boats and rowed away to
an island, where they found a Chinaman called
Moses. Stripped of its newspaper trimmings,
the Fifeshire wreck is a simple story with a prom-
inent Biblical character hovering uncertainly in
the background, and a few thousand years hence
earnest searchers after the Truth will be found
fighting amongst themselves as to which version
is the correct one—the bulrush or the Fifeshire.
Unless a big gale has happened along since the
crew took to the boats, the Fifeshire is still bolt
upright in mid-ocean with the rags of its sails
flapping disconsolately in the wind. As the
mariners left, the Fifeshire looked less like a wreck
than a patient ocean hen who was trying to hatch
out a setting of reef eggs and make palm islands
of them.
Archdeacon Potter was very wrath with
A. Kookaburra Peacock, Chief Secretary (since
resigned), for allowing the Rev. Geo. Gladstone
and another dismissed Anglican parson the
privilege of continuing to perform marriages.
“Your action seems to me to be in direct opposi-
tion to the Church of England authorities,” wrote
the infuriated Archdeacon. It is hard to eliminate
from the Anglican clerical mind the idea that its
Church is licensed to boss the holy job in these
parts. Peacock replied that so far as his office was
concerned marrying was a civil business, and he had
merely given the gentlemen in question civil
appointments that had nothing to do with the
Church —which, by the way, in such circumstances
is never civil.

Before the time expired for making claims
on the Vic. Railway Department on account of the
Sunshine disaster, no less than 50 summonses were
served, including 24 for the full amount allowed by
law (£2000), and one for £5OOO. These claims' only
account for 14 deceased persons ; and, as the De-
partment is known to have already paid certain
claims in full, probably it has already “parted”
quite as much as the £74,398 it is now being sued
for. There were altogether 44 killed and over 300
injured, and as this writer knows of one case
wliere a passenger got £lO for a trifling shock and
a torn overcoat, and another where a victim was
invalided for a week—and spent the time fishing
and flirting at a country resort—and was then
solaced with a trifle of £OO, he reckons Tait’s next
balance-sheet won’t look too healthy.

“Hamer” : When the Clerks’ Union gets
out a report on the prevailing conditions of clerical
employment in Sydney, the details will make the
revelations in the Shop Assistants’ Arbitration
case seem almost tame. Quite a number of people
are supplying the Clerks’ Union with information,
and some of it is interesting. For instance, one
big importing firm which employs a staff of
women clerks pays the one in charge of the
four others the staggering salary of 12s. 6d. per
week. Details of the wages of the other four
women are not given, because apparently what
they get is not worth mentioning. Another
importing firm—the importing firms are far and
away the worst sweaters —has a clerk who, after
20 years’ service, rose to a position of trust and
importance, and a salary of 255. per week! But
there was balm in Gilead for that preposterous
Croesus, because recently the firm raised his screw
a princely half-a-crown “on account of the in-
creased cost of living under the tariff.” Also,
there are records of clerks who, as a regular
thing and quite apart from overtime, are expected
to work from early morning to 7.30, and up to
9.30 on Saturdays. No wonder the clerks who
occasionally write to the papers and say that they
get £2 10s. or £3 a week can’t see anything to
growl at. They are the Fat Men, the Bloated
Aristocrats, of the business; and the Fat Man
never can see anything to growl at —except the
rank ingratitude of the lower orders.

Architects are foretelling disaster to the
new Melbourne central railway station. Appar-
ently to save initial
expense, Tait is con-
structing the inner
wall of the long build-
ing, not of brick or
reinforced concrete,
but of Oregon studs,
covered with Oregon
boards, covered again
with zinc sheeting,
and covered again
with two coats of
paint to represent
brick in places, marble
in patches, and gran-
ite in spots. Of
course it is sham and
shoddy, and when the
zinc sheets warp and
buckle, as they will
in summer, it will be
very unsightly shod-
dy. But the worst
feature is the danger
from fire. As built,
that long, high, nar-
row building is practically a flue with an ideal
natural draught, and once that pine facing catches
fire all the water in the Yan Yean reservoir won’t
put it out.
At Banana (Central Q.), a family feud
similar to that which raged in mediaeval times
between the Montagues and the Capulets, and
having points of resemblance to the unpleasant-
ness that for many weary years marred the lives
of the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, flaunts itself in
public places, and refuses to lie down. The pro-
moters of the feud are one Carter and a photo-
grapher named Kirkman. The feud broke into
the local police court recently, and was respon-
sible for the following litigation '• —
W. R. Carter v. G. Kirkman. (Plaintiff charged defendant
with striking him with a heavy whip.) Defendant fined
£2, and 4s. 6d. costs.

Even if ib were true —which it doesn’t
seem to be—.that Treasurer Lyne addressed Miss
Grace Watson's friend Mrs. Smith as plain
“Smith,” there would be some excuse for his con-
duct. Supposing the same lady had been maid to
one of Grace Watson’s rich Anti-Sosh friends at
Toorak she would have been called “Smith”
quite as a regular thing. And if she had been
kitchen toiler at the same place she would have
been called “Mary Ann.” Miss Grace Watson’s
Anti-Sosh friends at Toorak are so lacking in
manners that “ Smith ” or “ Mary Ann ” is quite
common with them.

Waybaclc Queensland has come forward
with a special, exclusive, home-grown grievance.
Very few townships have more than one doctor ;
and when he is called away—on a law case, for
instance—the township just has to take any old
medicine that it happens to have on hand ; and as
occasionally the con-
sequences haven’t
been satisfactory, it
wants the Govern-
ment to appoint a
relieving doctor who
will drop in at such
times, and deal out
drugs in due form.
At Bouliasome time
ago, it is mentioned
by way of illustra-
tion, a couple of
men were com-
mitted to stand
their trial on a
charge of having
killed a blackfellow
at Bedourie. The
Boulia doctor ex-
amined the abori-
gine’s bones and
gave evidence as to
the cause of death.
Subsequently lie had
to go right away to
Charters Towers for
the Criminal Court
trial. There were
six or seven patients, some of them seriously
ill, in the local hospital, yet he had to leave
them to do the best they could for three
weeks. Last month at Wmton, another one-
doctor town, typhoid was very prevalent, but the
place was ten days without a physician, as the
local man had to go to Charters Towers in a
Supreme Court case. Places such as Cloncurry
and Georgetown, where mining accidents are
always a possibility, are often days without their
doctor, who probably is away explaining things
about a corpse to a jury at Norman ton.
A Bendigo (Vic.) jury has given £75 libel
damages to John Neeld, commercial traveller and
birdicide, who shoots pigeons under the romantic
name of “Locksley.” The defendant, a publican,
had accused him of being in league with the
books when he did murder most fowl, and
of making money—making Loeksley’s Haul
in fact —out of the alleged conspiracy between
him and Moses. This attempt to cast a
slur on the untarnished honor of his dead
bird roused Locksley to anger, hence the proceed-
ings. The jury’s decision clears Locksley of all
suspicion save that of being a habitual pursuer of
a heartless and callous game which ought to be
made punishable with three months in gaol.
Luck occasionally comes the way of the
poor sailorman, as witness the North Coast
(N.S.W.) boat Noorebar, which in August last,
running down the coast, found £40,000 worth of
property in the shape of the big steamer Komura,
sugar-laden, drifting on to the rocks near Smoky
Cape, with a broken tail shaft. Dozens of vessels
pass Smoky every day, and it was the Noorebar’s
luck to be the first to see the lame duck’s rockets.
After a heavy and risky tow the two vessels
reached Newcastle, and the rescuers promptly
fired a writ at the rescued. After a tussle in the
courts the little coasting boat gets a verdict of
£2OOO. Most of it, as usual, goes to the company,
which did nothing but spend a little extra on coal;
still the skipper gets a year’s salary (£250) for one
night’s work, the mate and engineer each get a
£5O-note, and the inferior ratings cut up £250
among them.
THE CUP THAT CHEERS (THE
BOOKMAKER).
A. man for whom the Victorian police had
vainly searched for 10 days strolled into the
Melbourne watch-house the other evening,
and, after getting himself arrested, told a
most amazing narrative. He had been manager
of a suburban pawnshop, and disappeared
on October 6; also £lOOO worth of household
treasures and coin disappeared at the same
time or soon after. His tale was that, being
in the city on October 5, he encountered two
strangers, who urged him to go with them to
Mentone, in Bent’s electorate, and price some
diamonds they had for sale. He said they had
some drinks, then went to Mentone, where they
had more drinks—several more drinks —and after
that he knew no more till he found himself in the
scrub next morning. Then he missed his keys,
and learning from the papers that the pawnshop
had been raided, became afraid to return. Also
he narrated that he had wandered about the scrub
in that locality for the whole ten days without
anvthing to eat or drink. It was a large size in ex-
planations, and takes a deal of swallowing ; but
still a lot of unusual things have happened in
Bent’s electorate.
THE AD. IRRESISTIBLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A firm of auctioneers offers for sale residential blocks
at Kogarah, setting forth in the advt. that they are
“ situated close to the premises of Mr. Joseph Garruthers.’’
You may talk of Swanee Rivers and of old Kentucky
homes,
Of the Fauburg of St. Martin and Lhe mansions of Mayfair,
Of the bosky dells that track you through the lines of
many pomes,
Of the water fronts of Mosman, and their beauties rich
and rare ;
But the very best credential
Of the site that’s residential
Is to hear a loud shrill yapping as the weeds you daily
hoe,
For he’s got the best position
Who is near a politician—
So come along to Kogarah and live near Joe.
The views are quite magnificent ; the soil is just the
thing,
The ground is nice and level, and the blocks are broad
and deep ;
While the drains are simply perfect, and the flowers in
early Spring
Throw a perfume o’er the landscape where the songbirds
trill and cheep.
But these things are merely' trifles
To a tower as big' as Eiffel’s
To the fascinating facts that make our hearts in rapture
glow ;
For there’s chances to erect a
House from which to look on ’Ector—
So come along to Kogarah and live near Joe.
For, if you’re an early' riser, you can get a glimpse of ’Ec.
In the backyard as he’s standing with the soap beside the
tap.
You can see that chief unbending as he bends to wash his
neck,
And on Saturday's and Sundays you can listen to the yap
When his speeches he’s rehearsing,
And the Commonwealth he’s cursing,
And your blood runs cold to hear the awful tale of Sydney’s
woe ;
For with drama we’ll provide you—
There’s Bland Holt laid on beside .you—
So come along to Kogarah and live near Joe,
N.S.’.V.

A REAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY.
WILL those British Australians who are
willing to voluntarily give £1 per year to
build an Australian Navy from (as far as possible)
Australian material, to be victualled by Australian

“ Bondite ” makes a few remarks concern-
ing the impertinence of certain young persons who
presumed to criticise their betters
Bitter experience had a lot to do with the Anti-Sosh
Women’s Congress refusal to meet Mrs. Macnaniara, of
the Sydney Socialists, in debate. The Anti-Sosh League
in Melbourne, which is the head and forefront of the whole
weird body, encountered trouble a couple of years back
over that same kind of thing. Its hired lady lecturer
had been doing a round of the suburbs, and her stunts in
Toorak and Malvern and St. Kilda hadn’t left a dry eye
in the whole assemblage. Then the Council got reckless
and decided that it was up to the lady-lecturer to get busy
in the industrial suburbs, and impart the elements of social
science to the lowly factory girl. Collingwood, it decided,
would be a nice place in which to start the Uplifting pro-
cess, and the hall was filled to the doors with Emma and
Jane and other damsels. Both the lady lecturer and the
secretary felt sorry for these poor girls, who had ob-
viously swallowed all that was told them by the rude,
brutal Socialist, and, in their blind and heathen ignor-
ance, had probably voted the Labor ticket. The lady
lecturer made the speech easy to understand, as be-
fitted the audience, and did her best for a solid hour
and a half. There wasn’t an interruption. The
girls seemed deeply impressed, but she was afraid it was
only stupidity ; and, with a view' to helping them out of
their darkness, the chairman announced that she would
now answer any questions the ladies present might desire to
ask. “ Right,” remarked a smart-looking Emma in busi-
ness-like tones as she stepped forward from the back. “ I
would like to ask the lady the name of the Socialist
writer she was quoting when she said that bit about
women being the property of the State, to be distributed
among the males by a department.” There was a hurried
confab between the lecturer and the secretary, and at
last the former explained that the quotation was from
Snitehski, the eminent Polish Socialist, 'writer. “Excuse
me,” interposed the questioner, “Snitehski is an
anarchist, and that quotation was taken from his work,
‘The Fallacies of Socialism.’” There was an awkward
pause. Then a voice was heard from the rear of the hall:
“I would like the lady to explain why she confuses use-
value with exchange-value. The distinction is one of the
most elementary economic facts, and entirely disposes of
the greater part of her argument about the relation of
productivity and wages.” There was another confab and
another explanation, a trifle more shaky and confused
than the economics had been. It was hardly finished
before a third Emma arose in the body of the hall. “ Will
the lady say from what part of Karl Marx’s works she
obtained the quotation about the marriage tie. I have
read all Marx’s works and I can’t place it.” The chairman
beamed delightedly as he saw a chance. “ Perhaps it has
not been translated,” he suggested. “No,” replied
Emma ; “ but I read all Marx’s books in German.” There
was no more asking for questions. The secretary moved
a hurried vote of thanks, and signalled deliriously to the
man at the gas-meter to lower the lights. Thereafter
Anti-Sosh restricted its efforts to Toorak and St. Kilda,
and the industrial suburb had to seek its humor on the
kerbstone as of yore.

Judges on circuit in the backblocks are
sometimes a good deal worried about the midnight
reposefulness of their lodgings. One of them
lately put his head out of his bedroom window in
a western N.S.W. town and feelingly expostulated
with two young people vJko were vowing eternal
affection on the footpath underneath. “I have
most arduous duties before me to-morrow,”
pleaded his Honor (there was a larceny case on
the list), “ and do please let me have a sleep.”
Another threatened to cancel a publican’s license
if he didn’t silence some singers in a neighboring
room. Their Honors should congratulate them-
selves that they did not do circuit 30 or 40 years
ago. In those days most pubs kept open all night
at court time for the refreshment of lawyers, wit-
nesses, criminals, etc., ahd were noisily and fight-
ingly open besides. The late Chief-Justice Alfred
Stephen tells of losing sleep for three nights
running owing to the drinking, fighting, dancing
and singing that went on in the rooms about him.
And in much more recent years a minor Judge,
who went down in his dressing gown and spoke
with unusual pomp to a crowd of tank-sinkers in
the bar, was suddenly upended and flicked with
the bar towel'where the tank-sinkers thought it
would do most good.
THE SAD, DEAD PAST, AND THE

His experience in this State, and his continued atten-
tion to the working of the Federal Treasury during the
best part of a decade, have constituted him a leader in
finance. —Daily Paper.

South Australia is discovering that the
worst use you can make of a man may be to put
him in gaol. A local M.P., who went wrong two
years ago, was the one person who had made a
systematic effort at stopping the Coorong from
silting up. Since his compulsory retirement, says
the Board of Agriculture, the Murray mouth is
50yds. wider than it was; two enormous sandhills
have disappeared; and a small boat can hardly
pass where there used to be 30ft. of water. “In
a very short time the mouth will be probably four
miles wide, and so shallow that it will be possible
for a pedestrian to wade from Middleton to
Kingston, a distance of nearly 90 miles.” The
Surveyor-General agrees, and Government action
is to be taken to save that fisherman’s paradise, the
Coorong, which is an enormous lagoon running
eastward from the Murray, just inside the sea-
shore.

The strip of soup between Port Mel-
bourne and Williamstown (Vic.) is churned up by
the most vivacious ferry service on earth—
when it runs. Sometimes, however, it
doesn’t run, but is scratched for many en-
gagements. There are, or ought to be,
four palatial, but tired, old sea monsters
conducting the service, though three of
them have lately been on furlough. Two,
the old Gem and Bald Rock —the latter a
superannuated green paddle veteran from
Balmain, which went Cabbage-gardening
when Sydney declined to stand it any longer
—have been out of the public eye for some
months on account of old age or acute
dementia, or something, while the other,
the Queen, lias been in dry dock for a
considerable time, suffering from pains in
the joints ; so the ’Town-to-Port or Port-
to-’Town passenger has been rushed across
the stew in a genial little tub with a motor
engine, which is always ready to spring
some violent excitement upon the passen-
gers. Occasionally it knocks off work en
route, and it takes quite a heap of time
and profanity to induce it to resume its
labors. Once—and that was just recently
—it struck work when within a few feet
of its berth at Port Melbourne, and only
some hastily-flung ropes saved it from
utter demolition against a dead end. For
the rest of the day it was defunct to the
world, so that the momentous Melbourne
Ferries Service Co., which owns the foolish
vehicle, had to hire a steam tug to carry
on the traffic. It seems about time that
State Enterprise hired a hearse to carry off
the co. without providing compensation to
its widows.
The National Mutual Life Association
people—the late Colonel Templeton’s office—got
a surprise the other morning when they found a
£lO,OOO libel writ waiting on the doorstep. Life
assurance offices get used to all sorts of claims turn-
ing up (even the man who is passed as a specially
select “life” to-day is liable to appendicitis or
orange-peel on the footpath to-morrow), but libel
writs don’t often come their way; those things are
the comfort and salvation of the newspaper man,
who otherwise wouldn’t have a thing in the world
to think about. Randolph Bedford, it seems, made
a few remarks about the Citizens’ Life people,
especially with regard to their industrial assurance
business, and the National Mutual is alleged to
have passed the remarks on to the world. Bed-
ford says he feels annoyed about the turn affairs
have taken, because it looks as though the
Citizens’ don’t believe he has got £lO,OOO. Judg-
ing by the counsel engaged, the National Mutual
isn’t going to take it sitting down ; and mean-
time, for the other office’s greater comfort, the
Citizens’ intimates that, whatever damages it
gets, it is going to pay them over to the industrial
policy-holders—the people whom Bedford said he
felt sorriest for.
The Sydney rockchoppers, in spite of
Wade’s Act, are striking again. The rock-
choppers are the men who cut tunnels through
the Hawkesbury sandstone whenever water and
sewerage or any such work is being carried out.
Theirs is one of the most dangerous and un-
healthy occupations known in Australia, and the
men who undertake it can dictate almost any
terms. Last year they intimated to the em-
ployers, chiefly the Water and Sewerage Board,
that they would only work for six hours a day.
They struck, and they got their six-hours day.
They wanted more for six hours than they used to
get for eight. Another strike, and they got their
higher wage. Various small strikes have occurred
since, and last week one member of their union was
found breaking the union rules. He was fined, and
the Water and Sewerage Board found it convenient
to hastily pay the fine. The secretary of the union,
however, told the secretary of the Board that
he wasn’t going for the cheque ; the cheque would
have to be brought to him. The Board’s secre-
tary swallowed this, but when a laconic message
reached him to remove the offender, the secretary
refused. Whereupon every chopper on the
Water Board’s contracts downed tools. The
Board talked of prosecutions under Wade’s Act,
whereupon every rock-chopper in Sydney and
suburbs dropped his tools also. The various
contractors are looking round helplessly for
more rock-choppers, but can’t get them.
Rock-chopping lias mighty little to recommend it
as a means of earning an honest coffin ; and if
there’s anything in the law of supply and
demand, which the daily papers talk so much
about to workmen, then it is pretty obvious that
even now the conditions are depressing enough
at the price. If rock-chopping had any points
about it the short hours and the wages would
bring a swarm of applicants.

“ F.” : The train service from Caulfield on
Cup Day was delayed to admit of the State
Governor and suite being accommodated with a
“special.” Hundreds of people who hoped to get
away before the last race was run, found a saloon
carriage with engine attached, drawn up at the
platform in readiness for his tardy Ex. Mean-
while, for his precious “special” the line had
been cleared. In Victoria, rather more than in
the other States, perhaps, the railway system
dances attendance upon distinguished “dead-
heads,” of whom Bent is the most frequent cause
of inconvenience to the public. And how the
railway servants of the public kow-tow to these
non-productive passengers ! Verily, there is more
rejoicing over one free passenger than over ninety
and nine mere persons who have bought their
tickets.

LJ was once so fair,
-4L The skies were ever
tender then,
The clouds that laced the
horizon ’were
Suffused with kindliness
for men,
And sea and air, and sky
and tree
Bent hearts of friendliness
to me.
The gods were living, all

The wanton birds sang
wonder lays,
The blossoms brake from,
sheer delight,
And beauty couched in
many bays;
But Love that sat with me
has flown,
And now I sit and brood
alone.
The sky is an infernal
glare,
The clouds roll up in
senseless drill,
The sea is flat, and dull,
and bare.
The cursed birds are
never still;
The lisp of waves along the
shore
Js an intolerable bore.
The twisted ti-tree looks like bones
Of ghastly cripples dead and gone;
The spiky grass, these gravel stones
Are beastly things to couch upon;
And as for Nature's brooding trees —•
Well, she can stow her sympathies !

Of green hills bending to the sea ;

IMPOLITE OR IMPOLITIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Rev. Mercer, of Tasmania, is evidently far from
convinced that chivalry always prohibits the laying on of
hands in the case of a woman. Lecturing at Melbourne
on chivalry and politeness, he said : “ I have met a woman
who would be a match for Tommy Burns. I trembled
greatly. I felt that even in a fair fight I might not have
a chance. The problem arose—Should I hit her ? ” The
Bulletin concludes from the fact that Bishop Mercer
doesn’t struggle around on crutches that he decided not
to hit her, or that, if he did hit her, he did it suddenly
and then ran hard.
And still the problem grim returns—
If he confronts a woman new,
Who’s got a punch like Tommy Burns,
And who for war and carnage yearns,
What should a gentle bishop do ?
If woman’s sensitive and weak,
Is clinging, tender, young and slight,
To kick her hard and make her shriek,
Or smite her on the other cheek,
Would be a course most impolite.
If, on the other hand, she’s out
With mighty fist and half a brick,
Is prone to bang, and bite, and clout, >
Then for a bishop soft and stout •
That course would be impolitic.

THE PREMIER’S INEBRIATES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When theN.S.W. Assembly was counted out last evening
the Premier’s Inebriates Bill was being discussed. —
Sydney Daily Paper.
By all the Furies and the Fates
Who govern empires, reaims, and states ;
And by Beelzebub who sates
The thirst of fools and runagates ;
I rise to ask as one who hates
The humbug which he contemplates—
Who are those poor unfortunates,
The Premier’s Inebriates?
Should he who wearisomely prates
Of sacrifices, and who “ slates,”
Rebukes, reviles, and oft berates
The actions of the other States,
And he who from the Estimates
The deepest woe anticipates,
Be classed with those degen.rates,
The Premier’s Inebriates?
Is he who virtuously inflates
His bosom and reiterates
The same old story, and relates
How ginger-ale oft elevates
Our aspirations, and abates
The thirst for beer in kegs and crates —
Is he among those profligates,
The Premier’s Inebriates?
Are they whom Charles educates
Till they are finished graduates
In censuring the'sister States,
And whose abuse one’s conscience grates—
Are they whose whine.perpetuates
The rancor it precipitates—
Are they those poor unfortunates,
The Premier’s Inebriates ?

From “ Bunny Bill ” :
Pore old “ Oict! ” He gets sum rummy idees inter his
brane reeeptiekle at times. He ses (B. 1/10/’C>B), “ should
he” (meanin’ a blo-fiy) “ buzz in large numbers on a hot
summer day when other sentient things are decorously
comatose ”* (wot disgustin’ langwidge, enyhow), “the
cocky will predict a fall of rain within three days and be
right every time.” Lawd only knows whare “Oict”
gained his iggsperience with big game frum. I’ll bet
enythink he’s never bin out campin’ or boardin’ at a see-
side coffee-pallis. I’m an aged an’veneerable man now,
an’ my eggsperience has shown that th’ blo-fly gets out
his buzzer ’nd starts buzzin’ on th’ first day that gives him
eny hope of summer follerin’ on. Shood he start later,
well, he’ll keep on buzzin’ like L, th’ hole three weeks of
flamin’ drj' wether that usually follers ; an’ then th’ rane
cums. “ Oict ” must’ve started takin’ an interist in blo-
fiies about the eighteenth day. Enyhow, the only re-
liarble rane-sine I can tell him of is one handed
down from my grate-grate-grandfather. Take, borrer,
or acquire an ordinary respectible, suburbin waterin’-can.
Place it on a plot uv newly-turned earth. About two
yards distant fix up alance-wood fishun’-rod with th’ butt
end about six inches in th’ ground. Greeze the inside uv
the can with salid oyle, ’nd havin’ attached a cord ter
th’ top joint uv th’ rod, tie the other end to an ordinary
lady’s hare-brush (with tortus-shelled back preferred).
Next take a length uv skippin’ rope belongin’ to a school-
girl uv 13, attach same ter th’ back handel uv th’ can, an’
chuck the other end over th’ lowest boughs uv a ring-
barked bamboo tree. Havin’ filled th’ can with water,
place a pare uv steel-rimmed spectickles with one glass
missin’ upon th’ front dore step. Then place a cucumber
in your top vest pocket. Take your pipe firmly between
th’ teeth ’nd haul on th’ rope till th’ can’s well off th’
ground. A slight shower is almost sure t’ toiler.
BAD LUCK.

on nothing but brandy .”
MR. JONES: “Just my blessed luck. I was un-
conscious all the time.”
CUTTING THE PAINTER.
“ Edyson ” : Reading some of the facts
about child-life in the backblocks, provided by
that N.S.W. sub-committee of the Public School.
Teachers’ Association, I am reminded of an
experience of my own in the Goulburn district? of
Victoria. I was resting and recuperating at
Coy’s, and late one night went ’possuming with a
native. At about midnight we came upon a
small boy,- who might have been nine, messing
about with rabbit traps on a hillside. I invited
the youth’s confidence. Wasn’t it time a kid like
him was in bed. He said there was lots of time.
He was going to turn in when he had fixed them
traps and skinned a “ string of kittens.” How
far was it to his home ? “ Oh, not fur ; not more’n
five mile.” Returning, we struck the same
youngster on the same hill. It was now about a
quarter past five, and the working boy was
gathering the early rabbit. “Now, look here,”
I said, severely, “haven’t you gone to bed yet?”
He regarded me with scorn. “Cripes !” he said,
“d'yeh think a bloke lives in bed? Why, I’ve
on’y jist got up.”
Some recollections of Black Brother ;
During the trial in Brisbane of the officers of the black-
birder Hopeful, charged with murder, the writer saw a
South Sea Islander, with bushy, lime-bleached hair
bunched round his head, in the witness-box, leaning
forward, looking gravely with wide-opened eyes at Chief
Justice Lillev. Among the questions asked before he was
sworn were these: “You good boy?” “Yes, I mis-
sionary boy.” “You know Jehovah?” “Yes.” “Did
you ever see Him?” “Not before to-day,” replied the
witness, reverently regarding the wigged and gowned
Judge.
The next witness for the prosecution was Messiah, the
ship’s cook, an educated American negro. Chubb, counsel
for the defence, asked him why, when the Hopeful, on its
way to Townsville, was boarded by men-of-war officers,
he did not complain to them of the tragedy. Messiah
replied : “ It occurred to me to do so, but it also occurred
to me that if I did, when the Hopeful got to Towns-
ville the ship’s cook would be missing.”
Then said Chubb : “ Have you ever heard the line of
Shakspeare, ‘ I can smile and still be a villain ’? ” “Oh,
yes,” replied Messiah, “I thought of it when I saw you
smiling at me this morning.”
And then Chubb sat down feeling worse.
“ Flinderino ” : Cooktown is the home of
the Australian curiosity shop. Every second
business establishment in the town is a
miniature museum. (The hotels are in between.)
A display of aboriginalities is on view in almost
every shop window, and is good bait for the visit-
ing tourist from the south, who always carts away
an assortment of King Billy accoutrements. The
dealer in curios has for sale boomerangs, waddies,
woomeras, nulla-nullas, dilly-bags, stone axes,
dug-out canoes, paddles, armlets, native fishing-
nets and lines, firesticks, several varieties of
spears, painted shields, grass girdles, ear and nose
ornaments, head decorations, charms, and dozens
of other sundries. The only aboriginally that
has to be ordered two days ahead is a corroboree.
Incidentally the shopman sells all sorts and sizes
of shells, pieces of coral, beche-de-mer, pearl
shell, tortoise shell, sharks’ teeth, stuffed alli-
gators, cocoanuts, burra-burras (match-box beans),
and a host of etceteras. All these things the
curiosity man collects at the blacks’ camp and
from the crews of beche-de-mer luggers. He
usually pays for them with plugs of cheap tobacco,
trash pocket-knives, or some other rubbish.
“ Dandalup ” writes in anger :
It made my blood , boil and my reserve vocabulary to
exhaust itself considerably when I read “ 10-2-4’s ” par
(B. 24/9/’08) re the “ Englishman in Australia” who told
the Sydney Evening News “ that Australia had no sea-
fishing for amateurs off its coast, as in the English
Channel.” I have fished in almost every State of the
Commonwealth, and my labor has been rewarded with
much spoil. Only last November I spent, with four com-
panions, three weeks on a fishing trip up the Westralian
coast about Geraldton, Shark Bay, Bernier Island and
Carnarvon. Two days after we first dropped our lines
my fingers were raw—the effect of pulling the fish aboard.
(Two 141 b. schnapper on your line in five or six fathoms of
water is no easy work.) Although, owing to very rough
weather, we only spent three daysin actual fishing during
the cruise, we caught over 650 fish, including schnapper,
cod, jewfish, tailor, and many other kinds. We also got
eight sharks, but they are not counted. My share totalled
over 100, and I’m oniy an amateur fisherman when com-
pared to some men who fish off that prolific coast. Most
of the schnapper landed were over 101 b. in weight, and
some weighed the scale down at 201 b. These big fellows
are called nor’-westers, and are beggars to pull. When
we arrived back at Geraldton we had over two tons of fish
on board, and I guess even then we left a few behind us.
Heaps of fish have been caught off the Westralian coast
and sent up to the goldfields on ice, and there are many
men even now making £4 to JEIO per week at the fishing
business. The Australian coast, and especially that of
Westralia, I consider a fishermen’s paradise. Finally,
this English Johnny who fabricated to the Sydney
Evening News is a liar.
A SIGN OF FESTIVITY.

SO-AND-SO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(With apologies to Brunton Stephens' “ Celestial Chef")
’Twas a night of hot December, ninety-odd degrees from
zero ;
Pierce mosquitoes held high revel, and the moon was
mooning low ;
When upon the scene came cringing what I’m pleased to
call my hero —
Just a squat and ugly Ohow —by name we dubbed him
“So-and-So.”
He came sidling to us sideways, like a rooster scenting
battle.
He was hideous, with a face as hard as any anthracite ;
And a form of curves and contours liable to frighten
cattle—
As he slid into our vision on that hot December night.
We were mouthing over ghost-yarns, and occasionally
shivered
As we gazed into the darkness past our small mosquito
fire;
So that when into the light there peered a face a-grin
and livid
We were tempted to vacate, without delaying to inquire.
But he ventured forth so humbly, and his slippered feet
so slowly
Dragged and scraped along the ground as we sat gasping
in a sweat ;
And his ugly face was grinning, and his aspect seemed
so lowly
That within my midnight visions I can view him even yet.
“You want cookee?” was his question;—and we rose
and clasped him to us,
And we wept huge tears of welcome for the joys that
were to come.
“ Walk right in,” we sang in chorus ; “ walk right in—
we guess you’ll do us.
And we’ll have meat-pie to-morrow and a pudding of the
plum.”
“You give wagee?” was his query; —and we lovingly
assured him
That a king’s remuneration should be his, and nothing
less.
And with pledges and by promises we angled and we
lured him;
And e’en dared within our joy his filthy pigtail to caress.
He seemed sinless as an infant; and his eyes wentheav’n-
ward turning
As he begged us modestly our bonafldes to produce.
And we set his pigtail bobbing, and his piggy eyes
a-burning,
As we waved huge golden nuggets in his countenance
obtuse.
O we passed a pleasant evening on that hot night of
December,
As he vowed in pidgeon-English friendship, love, and
faith eterne.
And at supper-time he made us savory cakes to long
remember,
With a subtle hint of spice to start our stomachs on the
yearn.
O we went to bed delighted with the promise of the
morrow;
And we chuckled in our wisdom as we mused on So-and-
So ;
Of the pork-pies and the puddings—things to give sur-
cease from sorrow ;
And we went to sleep expectant, with our stomachs all
aglow.
In the morning, 10, he called us—had the tea and toast
a-steaming;
All his walnut face a-shining as he watched our glad
surprise.
All his infantine emotions in his coal-black eyesa-gleaming
As he set before our gasping selves as many hot meat-pies.
O we fell with zest upon them, never asking whence their
coming :
O our teeth played royal battle with the juicy hunks of
meat;
While he sat aside a-smiling, with his finger-ends a-strum-
ing,
And his almond eyes down-looking in a manner quite
discreet.
O what could we do but trust him ? O what could we do
but leave him
In proud charge of our belongings as we went to work
the patch?
Telling him our ev’ry secret, so as not to gall and grieve
him
With a hint of hard suspicion—this pure soul without a
match 1
So we swung our picks right gladly, and we chanted songs
right gaily
As we hauled the buckets brimming to the chanty of
“ Yo-ho! ”
And commented on the fact of fancy cakes and puddings
daily,
And adjudicated on the points of priceless So-and-So.
But the working hours dragged slowly, and our stomachs
waxed a-weary
Of the waiting for the twilight, when he promised we
should dine.
O we never grew so hungry as the day lagged long and
dreary,—
As our longings went to thee, celestial spirit superfine !
When we reached the camp we hailed him : “So-and-So,
dear friend, come hither 1
Let us feast our gaze upon you, and our teeth upon your
pies.
Saffron friend, we pray, come hither’’—only echo answered
“ Whither ? ”
As we searched with growing zest, and gazed askance in
our surprise.
But he came not, —O he came not 1 sweet and stately
Chinese lily !
Tho’ we called with voices drooping, and our spirits
waxing sore.
So we lit the same old camp-fire, and we boiled the same
old billy;
And we feasted on the same old bread and dripping, as of
yore.
Then it came to us so slyly, in the sugar-pot concealing ;
Game upon us in an agony of grief and cruel woe ;
Just a little note of parting, by its folded end revealing,
J ust a billet-doux of friendship from the truant So-and
so.
“Friends and brothers,” ran the missive; “tho’ an
Eastern son celestial,
By best college education have I learned the Western
wiles ;
Left behind me all my native tricks —so lowly and so
bestial;
Gathered ’round me all the glory from the city’s highest
styles.
“ I was ‘ stony ’ —so despairing, I was forced to ‘ raise the
breezes’;
It was time I did the mandarin in Sydney city’s streets ;
So I struck your camp at sunset, and wheezed out the
same old wheezes
As I’ve wheezed them o’er and o’er upon the same old
country beats.
“ But, dear friends, you were so easy, that I thought my-
self a-sleeping;
And I feared to swift awaken and discover it a dream ;
So I pity took upon you—placed your gold in safer keep-
ing,
Just to prove to you, my brothers, that things are not
what they seem.
“ Just to help me on my journey, I purloined your horse
at starting—
Don’t say ‘ steal ’; ’tis such a nasty word I—l know you
will not mind.
And the pies you ate with gusto—weep a tear-drop at the
parting,
For I guess if sought till Doomsday, Tom, the Oat, You’ll
Never Find 1
“Just a word, my friends, concluding: Let this be a
lesson to you ;
Learn that China, when she starts, is just the ’cutest
cuss alive.
If you train the wily heathen he’s in duty bound to ‘do ’
you,
To instruct you by your teaching just how many beans
make five.”
O we cursed him and his offspring 1 O we tackled his
ancestors
As we raged around the camp-fire on that hot December
night ;
And we sent him to the region where his soul must be
asbestos
If it stand the sultry climate, with the bonfires all
bedight.
In the morning by the sunrise softly, silently we
vanished :
For we’d worked the patch to death, and So-and-So our
fortune had.
Thus we set across the ranges grim, like patriots long
banished,
And we humped the lonely road to Sydney city “ on our
pad.”

“ Flitiderino ” : A couple of years ago the
boxer hat was unknown in North Queensland. It
is said that a hard-hitter did show itself in Cook-
town late last century, but the wearer was pur-
sued by a mob of blacks armed with stone-axes
and dinner forks. However, the bowler, which is
the most senseless sort of hat to wear in a semi-
tropical climate, is now to be seen in hosts in the
Northern towns. A canefields ganger togged
himself up the other Sunday to go and do the
Romeo act. With saddle on his arm he gaily
vaulted the paddock fence and whistled up his
trusty steed. Blossom came at a trot, but the in-
stant it beheld its master it did a back somer-
sault and bolted in the direction of Africa. Bill
followed the noddy all over the place for an hour,
and grew desperate. His language became the
color of a murdered sunset. He had called the
scared animal 10 different kinds of a cow, and
was about to throw up the job in despair, when one
of the onlooking canecutters suggested that he
should take off his hat and plant it. Bill
tumbled. With his brand new hard-hitter hidden
behind his back, he walked quietly up to Blossom,
adjusted the saddle, and rode off to meet Juliet.
“E.A.” : “Henry Phelthatt’s ” descrip-
tion of how a bushwoman determines the real age
of an allegedly twenty-one-year-older is very
exact. The bushman’s genius for irrelevant detail
is quite as pronounced. The other day a horse-
man galloped down the road with excitement in
his whiskers and a wild glare in his eye :
“ Bill Somers’ Tom’s lorst in the scrub. Goin’ fer the
perlioe,” he shouted to a cobber in the way.
The cobber was unsatisfied.
“Here, Jim ! Hey I" he hollered.
Jim pulled up. “ Bill Somers’Tom ? Lorst f That be
d—-d.”
“By cripes, ain’t he I’’ said Jim, knowingly. “ ’E’s
lorst, all right.”
“ You don’t say ? ’Ow old wuz ’e ? ”
“Well, I can’t say exackly ’ow old ’e wuz, but you
know that there mare o’ mine ?—well, she wuz risin’ two
w’en ’e wuz a nipper. You mind the time we took them
wethers out to the mountains? That’s 17 year come
next shearin’. Well, I bought her off Paddy Shea (’im wot
used to ’ave the store w’ere Mick Nugent keeps the
pub). It was the day I swopped that there ’alf-bred kan-
garoo dawg ”
Cobber (brightly intelligent): “Not the big feller
wot got ripped that day we wuz musterin’ them steers fer
Bairnsdale ? ”
Jim (delighted): “ Y-a-a-i-i-r-r-s, that’s the cove.”
Cobber (equally delighted): “ That be d—d ! ”
Jim : “ Well that’s ’ow I reckon ’is age, anyhow, becus
that there mare wuz on’y a foal. I see ’er first standin’
over be the big gum where they used to ’ang the beasts
afore it wuz struck be lightnin’ in that big storm just afore
lamb markin’. It wuz the year that cove come up from
Goulburn an’ bought the mob o’ weaners—d’yer mind ?
The cove ” (growing excited) “ wot shouted the bottle
w’en we delivered ’em over ? ”
Cobber (thoughtfully, but with a little doubt) : “ Y-a-
-a-i-i-r-r-s.”
Jim: “ Well, that’s’im." And during the next 15 minutes
Jim managed to drag in the missus and the kids, the old
sow, one heifer, most of his dogs, the dead years and the
entire population ; and he had reached the woodheap
before he remembered that Bill Somers’Tom remained
lost, and galloped madly off again with the gale in his
whiskers.
A FRENCH TOURIST IN AUSTRALIA.
“Ze silly laughing asses, I vill destruction zem.”
A Westralian bushman was lately operated
on in a Perth hospital for appendicitis. In the
offending appendix were found 40 small balls of
solder, and some fragments of quartz. Bill
Wayout wasn’t a human ostrich ; he was simply
an eloquent example of the Tinned life. A long
course of tinned fish, tinned milk, tinned fruit,
tinned vegetables, and tinned dog had resulted in
this collection of solder. As to the samples of
quartz, they probably stuck to Bill’s damper
while it was cooking. The bush party has re-
covered to return to his tinned life ; but he hasn’t
any appendix now to catch the stray bits.
“ Polstan I allow that it is fairly re-
markable that some men can tell the time
to the minute without the aid of time-
pieces, and under any circum-
stances ; but more remarkable
still is the manner in which
birds and animals roll up
at meal times. Are they
merely ruled by hung-
er, or can they tell the
time ? There’s an old
white cockie in this
town that flies off to
bring his boss home to
dinner so regularly
every day that the
townsfolk set their
clocks by him. The
boss may be late or
early, but cockie is
there to the second. A
neighbor of mine had a
big yellow hound that
used to send up a wail
like the burst-up of Hades
at exactly four o’clock every
morning. I broke him of the
habit with a Winches-
ter at last. He w'as
a useful dog if you
wanted to catch the
early train, but as
I never wanted to
do that, I had no
use for him. Be-
sides, there was no
early train to
catch if I
had want-
ed it.
A MAN OF WEIGHT.
GINGER: "Ain’t yer goin’ to ’ave a toss, Cobber?”
COBBER: “ Toss! Blime, d’yer fink a man’s
goin ’ to be a kid orl his natural? I per-
scribes to Tatt.’s! ”
“Gilrooney ” : I have been voyaging down
the Darling River (N.S.W.) in one of those crazy
little steamboats that smoke, and fuss, and
whistle, and excitedly thresh the mighty deep
into foam without getting much further ahead.
And I have become familiar with certain signs.
For instance, when the captain (and there’s
generally about three of him on a Darling
River boat) stares intently at a well-
trodden pinnacle near the water’s edge
on the eastern bank, he is about to back-
paddle, swing to, and cast anchor, to
deliver a pound of tobacco to a lonely
fisherman. When he gazes violently at
a high, precipitous bank, which no uni-
nsured goat would attempt to climb, he
is pretty certain to stop for two hours to
cut and take aboard firewood for the
engine. (All the easy landing-places
have been denuded of fuel years ago.)
When the whole three of him manipu-
lates the steering wheel with one hand,
and holds his nose with the other, a
camel-team has just left Thargomindah
(300 miles away in Queensland) for the
Cooper or the Thompson. And when
the three captains, the cook, the crew,
and the pet kangaroo all hold their
noses with every hand they’ve got, and
let the boat steer itself, a river wool-
scour is somewhere within 50 miles. A
wool-scour, it might be mentioned, is an
appalling catastrophe. A man who
works about a wool-scour is Lost. The
smell of wool gets into his soul and turns
it black, and the yolk of wool enters his
language and turns it blue, and the
density and general cussedness of wool
impregnates his understanding and
makes it thick, and in the end he thinks
and acts like the wool-scour itself. P.S. —All
this valuable information is hereby offered gratis
to the “N.S.W. Tourist Guide”—and itcan have
the plug of tobacco as a bonus, and the precipitous
bank as an honorarium, and the camel smell as a
subsidy, and the wool-scour fragrance as an ever-
lasting annuity. It is too much knowledge forme
to hold in one lump.

“ Kati-Kati,” re rabbit extermination
Does any disease exterminate? Humanity has been
ravaged by deadly diseases all along, yet man is as great
a pest as ever. Disease tends to prevent overcrowding,
and removes the weak. The strong easily resist attack,
or become immune. The potato disease does not exter-
minate the potato. In unfavorable weather drops fail,
but the next year potatoes may be as cheap as ever. I
have had them die down with the blight in the autumn,
and come up again in spring and do splendidly. Again,
the groundsel is very subject to a fungus disease. In the
garden we see it die off all over the place, yet enough
always seeds to keep the place fully stocked. How would
it be for Australia to specialise, and become the rabbit
farm of the universe ? The climate seems favorable. The
only fence necessary would be the ocean. Devoting their
whole energies to the care, catching and killing of bunny,
the native born would soon develop the lissome limbs of
a cat, and the jumpiness of a kangaroo, so that trapping
and shooting would be superseded. Best of all, it would
be necessary to import everything but rabbits, and G.
Reid would die of joy.
• * * *
J. M. Hudson (M.L.) : Is it known to
science that mussels tame crabs ? On these coasts
every mussel keeps house with a pet crab. The
crab’s office is apparently to supply eyes for the
company. When the suckful schnapper ap-
proaches, the crab draws back into the shell,
thereby giving the mussel the office to bang the
front door. Ido not know whether the mussel
has adapted a special breed of crabs for this
purpose or whether it simply incarcerates and
trains young crabs that are wandering about. The
crabs are light in color and globular in abdomen. It
is possible they are pale from incarceration
(and deferred hope) and bloated from inactivity.
Why the crab doesn’t devour the mussel is a
mystery, but it is probable that the mussel has the
power of bringing pressure to bear on its partner
if the latter misbehaves. Practically every
mussel has a crab and no mussel ever has more
than one crab. The crabs have no shell, their
abdomens being quite round and soft and about
the size of a small pea.
“ Wrock ” : The Australian game of foot-
ball has pushed its way into some remote corners
of the Commonwealth. I witnessed a match re-
cently between a team of blacks from the Cum-
meragunja Mission Station (N.S. W.) and a band
of cookies’ sons from south of the Murray. The
collision took place on the N.S.W. bank of the
Big Trickle, and the spectators consisted of a great
muster of gins and piccaninnies from the station,
two or three kangaroos and a kookaburra. The
’roos and the ’burra viewed the proceedings from
afar. The enthusiasm of the barrackers was in-
tense. The gins, in their excitement, rushed far
’bailers to “ Bog into it, Cummera! Tear um
out on the playing space and urged the dusky
down white pfellar.” &
When the ball, by any
chance, came their way
the shady supporters,
young and old, turned
tail and lit out for the
big gums that formed
the boundary line. The
Cummera boys bogged
in with great zest, but to
no purpose. The weight
of the farmers carried all
before them, and the
score at half-time showed
—Whites, four goals six
behinds ; Blacks, nil.
After the interval they
bogged in some more.
The barrackers strenu-
ously advised the ebony
athletes to “ Fer Gawd’s
sake, git a goal!” But
the brawny cockies fell
upon the dark host with
great slaughter, and
piled up many points. In
the final quarter the local
All Blacks gathered what was
left of themselves together and made
a big effort, but they failed to get within
scoring distance, and the Cow-Punchers ran out
winners by six goals ten behinds to nothing.
Three cheers were given for each side, the kan-
garoos streaked for the horizon, and the gins and
small fry crawled sorrowfully homewards, hurling
abuse at the umpire who, in their opinion, was
“ no plurry good.”

Explorer “Larry” Wells, who returned
to Adelaide a few weeks ago from the Northern
Territory, after a couple of years’ hard trigono-
metrical survey work, brought with him some
splendid samples of cotton which he found grow-
ing wild at Kathleen Falls, on the Flora River,
70 miles from the Pine Creek railway station, and
50 miles from the Katherine telegraph station. The
cotton bushes had grown from seed-pods carried by
black brother from Old Delamere, on the Aroona
Creek, where Dr. Browne’s employees had previ-
ously experimented. The natives took the pods for
corroboree purposes, and the seeds dropped
under a tree a few yards from the river. Wells
says the clump was 20ft. in diameter and 10ft.
high. The rainfall thereabouts is from 50in. to
70in. a year, and the water goes over Flora Falls
at the rate of 100,000,000 gallons in 24 hours. A
good flow is continuous throughout the year, and
Wells made enough observations to satisfy him
that the land could be easily irrigated, and that
there was a large area suitable for cotton-growing.
“ Victor Wynne ” : Allow me to hold forth
on the theme of the N. Queensland stinging tree.
It is soft and succulent, with large, round leaves,
on which are the minutest of bristles. It looks
harmless. Touch it, however, and you learn
the difference. It stings without any trouble
through a stocking, and even through light
clothes, and one experience of its bite makes
the victim wary for life. The pain is ex-
cruciating for an hour or two. A nip on the
hand causes a painful swelling under the armpit,
and one on the leg ensures a like disturbance in
the groin. The affected part will irritate for days
and weeks, and on bringing it into contact with
cold water the sting can be felt often for months
afterwards. Cattle will brush past the stinging
tree without injury, but with horses it is some-
how different. The stinging tree cost many
a good steed his life in the early days
when pack teams travelled from the coast
to the Atherton and Herberton districts. The
horse is liable to brush up against a tree on
the edge of a narrow track. Wild and frightened
at the sudden pain, it rushes headlong into the
scrub, and probably encounters more stinging
tree. Finally, blind with agony, it rushes into
trees and fallen logs, and eventually becomes
completely entangled in tenacious lawyer vines
and dies from exhaustion. There are numerous
cases of men, while working in the scrub naked to
the waist, being stung, and in some instances the
victim has had to be strapped down to prevent
him running amok. In my opinion the State
ought to offer a reward for the scalp of the
stinging tree.

“ L’Fou ” writes about the Martyrdom of
Cow :
I know Cow is regarded as a pampered joss to whom
sweated worshippers are sacrificed, and to sympathise
with her argues yourself a pal of Belial. But here (on a
big, casual sort of dairy farm, where breeds are mixed
enough to please even a Smith) I am haunted by the faces
in the yard. If I was bear-drawer Lindsay, or that
feline expounder, Souter, I’d specialise in cows. There
are possibilities in cow physiognomy if people could only
get past their prosaic traditions. There is the new heifer,
wild-eyed and graceful as a deer, nosing the fence
for a chance of escape. There is a sanctimonious
old bovine that gets up mothers’ meetings all over the
paddock, and an aggressive cow with broken horns that
just as regularly disperses them. There is the ethereal
group, thin with a thinness not of this world, and with
more than a hint of tuberculosis ; the Spiteful cows that
surreptitiously gore their neighbors; the placid, benign
animals we all hear of, and a score of other types. But
over all is the sorrowful blank look that is “ past caring.”
I don’t know whether it is the eternal dragging at the
milk-fountain, or the constant forced motherhood, or the
dogs, or the mud, or what. And it isn’t a drought-stricken
herd with an improvident owner who has been trusting
to luck. The same mournful aspect may be observed
when the animal is in front of the biggest armful of
lucerne ever cow gazed upon.
But it is these spring nights that make me real maudlin
sentimental. Then a line of bereaved mothers congre-
gate around and bellow in varying piteous keys for their
offspring, and the hungry calves (which don’t take to
hand-feeding right off) reply in a minor key of desolation.
If there is a cessation of the misery, it is broken by the
jangling of wire fences as a horned head tests their
strength, or by the dog barking and rattling his chain.
And through it all—and through the papered-hessian
walls—Mr. Oreamcans and the whole Oreamcans family
snore peacefully, as if no heart-broken mother 'were
padding restless up and down beyond the fence, and no
cold calf with but a straw to lie on were fretting in the
unstilly dark without. The Martyrdom of Cow is a very
real martyrdom indeed.

A SIMPLE PRESCRIPTION.
Said to Cuke Rheumatism, Kidney Trouble
and Bladder Troubles.
We know that the readers of this paper appre-
ciate good advice, and we are glad, therefore, to
be able to publish the following from a prominent
physician.
It is astonishing to know the prevalence of
kidney trouble and other diseases, such as rheu-
matism, bladder and liver troubles, which are
almost invariably caused by weak kidneys. It is
said on good authority that fully one-third of the
people in Australia who have reached the age of
maturity are more or less afflicted v/ith kidney
trouble in some form. The most dangerous
feature of this disease is the fact that many
people have it without their knowledge, and con-
sequently neglect it until it has reached a danger-
ous stage.
The least symptom of kidney trouble, such as
backache, must be given prompt attention, and a
good reliable treatment should be taken, until
every trace of the disease has been eliminated.
Wg are glad to be able to give our readers a pre-
scription which we have seldom known to fail in
any case. It contains no harmful ingredients, is
pleasant to take, not expensive, and can be
supplied by any good chemist. It is as follows
Tincture Gentian Compound, one ounce;
Syrup Rhubarb, one ounce ; Liquid Barkola Com-
pound, one ounce ; Syrup of Ginger, five ounces.
Take a teaspoonful after each meal, and one at
bedtime.
We are glad to publish this prescription, as we
know it will help our afflicted readers who give it
a fair _ trial. If taken continuously for a few
weeks it will be found to be an almost absolutely
certain cure for rheumatism,, kidney and bladder
trouble, backache, and all allied complaints.

A down-Soufch Parliament struck a painful
coincidence the other day. A former legislator,
who now looks upon the wine when it is red or
any other old color, stalked into the President’s
gallery in the Legislative Council Chamber with a
nxed glare in his rosy eye; and at the same
moment the Clerk announced that the subject for
debate was the Inebriates Bill. The ex-legislator
supplied the necessary awful example.

duction to the Syme biography are interesting.
Deakin's judgment is that Syme wasn’t the im-
placable person he has been often pictured.
‘A fierce adversary,” he says, “yet I do not
remember any vendetta that he was not willing to
conclude if openly approached, and hardly an
enemy with whom he remained continuously on
bad terms.”
Governor Le Hunte had the chance to stay
for an extended term as Governor of S. Aus., but
had to say “No.” He will leave behind him a solid
popularity amongst children and country folk ;
for lie has visited more schools and more town-
ships than any other man who ever held the vice-
regal job in the Wheat State. He does best at
Show dinners and such like functions, for,
although a wretched speaker, he is “a plain, blunt
man, who talks the sort of stuff that the farmer
likes to hear—about cabbages, pigs and the price
of oats.
Barrister Percy It. Waddy, one of the
well-known cricketing brotherhood, has abandoned
the law and taken up in its stead the Town
Clerkship of Deniliquin. In the matter of law-
abandonment the young man has extensive
precedent to back him ud. The list of barristers
who have chucked up their Chambers and taken
to other jobs than Bar-breasting is as long as a
bill of Costs. But in another respect the new
Town Clerk has established a record. He is the
only holder of the office in N.S.W. who is legally
entitled to keep his skull hot with horsehair.
Ex-Sergeant R. R. Ware, who, 40 years
ago, was in charge of the police at Maryborough
(Q-)> has been celebrating his 80th birthday by re-
counting the story of the discovery of gold at
Gy in pie in 1867. James Nash, the discoverer,
marched into the police office and dumped down
on the table a bag of nuggets. Nash had been
working on the Calliope, but met with an acci-
dent, and had to go to the hospital. On re-
covery he made off towards Gympie. The
prospects looked well, but for fear that he
might cause hardship by attracting men to
another duffer, he raised no commotion about
his luck till he was satisfied that the field was
good. Then Ware and others inspected the new
claim, and had a dig at it themselves. Amongst
thefindswasas7oz. nugget discovered by Ware him-
self. On that the news was given out at Mary-
borough. Ware ran short of miners’ rights in no
time, although he had 100 on hand, so he used
ordinary foolscap. Before he got any sleep he
had issued 1100. It was a memorable rush that
followed. A single ship from Maoriland brought
900 passengers.
Melb. ’ : Lately-deceased Bromley,
M.L.A., was the financial ruin of Maurice
Brodzky and his Table Talk. Yet Brodzky is
alone to be blamed. The paradoxical saying is
that when the man who never makes a mistake
makes one it is worse than anybody else’s.
Brodzky published a senseless, profitless libel on
Bromley. It is said that an apology would have
settled this. However, the obstinate man in-
sisted on fighting, and was cast in heavy damages
and Costs. This knocked him out. He said to
me, “ I’m a ruined man,” and that was all about
it. Table Talk was sold up. Brodzky first came
before the public about 30 years ago, in a Jewish
amateur performance of “Not a Bad Judge.”
Then he got on the Herald. He married Miss
Leon, daughter of a Geelong pawnbroker, and it
was her little dot that started Table Talk.
Brodzky told me that he fought on the French
side in the Franco-German war.
“Monty” Faithfull, who died
in Sydney last week, was something of a solicitor
(his firm was Iceton, Faithfull and Maddock), and
more of a sportsman. There was hardly any
branch of sport at which “Monty ” didn’t excel
at one period or other of his 61-year-long life.
Old-time cricketers talk with bated breath of his
bowling performances. He could have played for
his native land against England, on his ball-
hurling alone, had he wished it. He rode, drove,
card-played and raced with enthusiasm. He was
one of the best field-shots in the State. Also he
was a deplorably good hand at pigeon-slaving.
With his tall, soberly-clad figure, and his solemn,
benevolent-looking, side-levered face, he looked a
curious anomaly as he stepped to his far-back
mark at the N.S.W. Gun Club’s traps. The
spectacle was vaguely suggestive of a parson call-
ing for strong drink in a pub. Nevertheless—or,
perhaps, accordingly—the club made him its presi-
dent, and he held that office to the end.
The death of Yaiben Solomon removes the
finest beard from S. Australian politics. It was a
black and glossy bush, and the owner was proud
of it. S. Australia probably owns more public
whiskers than any other State. It is time imme-
morial since it even had a clean-shaven man on the
Supreme Court Bench. The greatest of its Judges
for 30 years past, Way and Boucaut, never shaved
at all. (By the way, the clean-shaven Judge is fast
disappearing in other places, too; only Barton
represents the hairless tradition on the High
Court Bench.) For over 30 years S. Australia has
also, with one exception, grown whiskers—and
mostly a full crop—on its Premiers. John
Downer was the one exception. Price, Solomon,
Kingston, Playford, Colton, Boucaut, belong to a
longdine of Premiers who never had to get up 10
minutes earlier and pull their faces out of shape.
Of this lot, Solomon was probably most jealous of
Colton ; but in his political days Colton’s jaw-mat
was more like a long silver tail. And no doubt
the prevalence of whiskers in S. Australia doesn’t
merely happen ; the bushy face tells a good deal
of the population’s bucolic character, and of its
general disinclination to spend much time on its
personal adornment.
SPATTERED AUSTRALIA.
The leaders of the Orange body in the several States
are working- energetically to further the object of estab-
lishing an independent Orange party in the Australian Par-
liament.— Daily Paper.
STRAY VISITOR : “So you are the celebrated White
Australia? Bless my soul, you are the most
colored person I ever met!”
Died last week, at Kiama (N.S. W.), where
Parkes’ ghost used to flap its wings over the Blow-
hole every election-time, Dr. Kinross, for 25 years
I rincipal of St. Andrew’s College within the
University of Sydney. He was a profound
scholar in the droughty regions of philosophy, and
could split a hair into seven lectures on the
slightest provocation.
k inal adjustments of David Syxne’s posses-
sions show him worth just on the edge of a
million. On June 13, 185(1, David bought at
McCombe’s auction mart, Melbourne, the Age,
Weekly Age, Leader, and the Age jobbing
business for £2OOO, on terms. Money was scarce
among newspaper men, so Svme, then a mere out-
sider, secured a bargain. The materials were
valued at £l5OO, so copyright and goodwill went
for £5OO.
The lately-deceased Vaiben Louis Solomon
once threatened to punch Kingston's head, and
was very near making the attempt. That was in
the S.A. Parliament, and the betting was 5 to 1
he would be killed if he tried the experiment.
Kingston in those days was a bitter orator, and
. Solomon’s Northern Territory Times had lost
three Chinese advertisers, so Solomon’s temper
was somewhat sour. Solomon’s first and last
Ministerial office was the Premiership of the
Sudden Ministry, which lasted seven days. His
elevation, instead of mellowing him, set his nerves
on edge ; by the fourth day of his greatness he was
an embittered man, and enemies sprang up like
blades of grass. At the first Federal election
(1901), when S.A. was a single constituency,
returning seven Representatives, Solomon got in
as sixth man behind Kingston, Bonvthon, Glynn
Holder and Batchelor. At the 1903 election he
contested Boothby against Batchelor, and there
was no more Sudden Solomon in Federal politics.
In 1905 he recaptured his old N. Territory seat in
the S.A. Assembly. The Territory had two
members for 1070 electors, as compared with
Adelaide’s four members for 27,179 voters, so
Solomon represented bare spaces mostly.
By this paper’s Oldest Inhabitant:—
Mr. 11. M. Faithfull, the “Monty Faithfull” of the
University cricket team of 30 years ago, when Tom Gar-
ret, Tommy Iceton, Joe Coates and other cracks were at
the game and taking high rank with bat and ball, died on
Thursday, after a long illness, at his residence, Elizabeth
Bay, Sydney. He was aged 61 years. Mr. Faithfull was
grandson of William Faithfull, who was connected with
the old New South Wales Regiment in the early days of
the colony. It was quite by accident that he found him-
self in Sydney instead of in Spain. He had enlisted with
the intention of joining some regiment then fighting in
the Peninsula, but was tagged on to tne N.S.W. (or Ruin-
selling) Corps; which, after all, was for the best. On
leaving the regiment he became manager of Colonel
Foveaux’s properly, and eventually settled on the
Ilawkesbury. In 1804 he married Miss Susannah Pitt,
whose family had just come to the country. One of the
sons, William Pitt Faithfull, settled at Springfield, near
Goulburn, and there “Monty” was born, his mother
being a Miss Deane, whose family came to Australia in
183/. Monty was a student of St. Paul’s College, and a
graduate of the Sydney University. In the early
’seventies he was admitted as a solicitor and went into
business with his old club-mate, Thomas H. Iceton. The
latter died last May. Mr. Faithfull married a daughter
of “Old Tom” Buckland, a director of the Bank of New
South Wales.
Old F. C. Brewer, printer, reporter and
journalist in and about Sydney for about 70 years,
received congratulations the other day on achieving
his 82nd birthday. He is now blind, but, like
Milton, sees clearly with the mind’s eye. His
articles of indenture show that he began the
printing craft under Edward Smith Hall, of the
Monitor, a pen-fighter of the early days. Hall
—Monitor Hall as he was called—paid fines for
libel when he could and went to gaol when
he couldn’t. Wentworth, then beginning at
the Bar, took up the ancient printer’s distresses*
and with Justice Dowling on the Bench, turned
the tables on Hall’s enemies. Hall gave up being
a chronic defendant, and started to proceed
against his prosecutors. In the first action the
verdict for Hall against R Bench of magistrates
for,malice brought £lO ; the next, against Hely,
Superintendent of Convicts, £25; two actions
against the Rev. Ralph Mansfield realised 40s.
each ; another action against Mansfield proved
worth £5O, and an action against Archdeacon
Scott panned out for £25. By this time it began
to be recognised that the Archimedean lever was
hitting back, and the supercilious powers of the
day acquired a sudden respect for Hall.
“J. Gr.” : Be
Winifred Janies,
authoressof “Bach-
elor Betty” (men-
tioned in B.
8/10/’08). The au-
thoress is a sister to
Cyril F. James, a
young Bendigo law-
yer. Cyril is about
the only Freetrader
that is left at
Q uartzopolis.
When Max Hirsch
had a brief reign
as M.L. A. for
Mandurang, Cyril
James was his
right-hand man.
Cyril contested the
Bendigo Federal
seat five years ago,
against sitting-
member John
Quick. Dave Smith
(Labor) also had a
shot for the seat.
James got an awful
beating by both
Quick and Smith,
and just managed
to scrape together
enough votes to
save his deposit.
It was an open
secret that had it
not been for Cyril
James, Dave Smith
would have wal-
loped John Quick;
a lot of Smith’s
friends voted for
Quick at the , last
minute to avoid
any chance of the
seat going to a
Freetrader, and so
John got 6020 votes
against D a v i d’s
5704. At the last Federal
elections Cyril James went to Melbourne and con-
tested Melbourne Ports. Out of 31,592 voters,
exactly 791 gave him a vote, and he left his deposit
with the Philistines. When Cyril James is not
spouting Foreign-trade or- Single-tax, he does a
bit of Bible-thumping, being a Methody local
screecher of some sort.
The N.S.W. Premiership is now officially
considered to entitle the holder to someminor sort
of Imperial gaud, should his hunger and thirst take
that direction. G. H. Reid looked another way
when the ribbon was dangled, but Twaddell and
Wade, though mere neophytes, dream of it. It
was thought that in Carruthers’ case a few old
things would have stood in the way, but the
British authorities have long ceased to mind any
few old things like that. Of the old-time Premiers
William Forster and James Squire Farnell were
the only ones to escape, and in Farnell’s case the
amazing story is told that it was Mrs. Farnell who
made her husband promise to say “No” if he
were ever given the chance to say “Yes.”
“ Eegeebee,” from a Sydney suburb :
That par. (B. 24/9/’OS) relating to the wealth of the Dud-
ley estates in Staffordshire (England) is as true as gospel ;
and, as might be expected, the ways and means by which
said wealth has been amass d are those of the wily and
the wicked. This scribe has good authority for know-
ledge of many a ruinous strike caused by the avarice of
the grandfather of the present earl, and one of the most
disastrous in the history of British labor was that which
occurred in the middle ’fifties, when the ironworkers of
one of the Staffoidshire estates had their miserable pit-
tances of 3s. to 3s. Cd. per day reduced 3d. all round.
The men, aroused by the iniquity of a proceeding
which threatened to make their wretched lot one
of utter misery, struck at once, and in less than
a fortnight more than 30,000 had joined their
ranks, and all the coal mines and iron works
in the county closed down. Deputations were met
with the agent’s unvarying reply that the estates could
ot *ly afford to carry on under the proposed reduction,
yet subsequent events proved that the mines alone netted
almost uncounted thousands for the capitalistic skinflint
who owned them. The men held out until reduced to a
condition of absolute beggary. Thousands tramped
throug h England, begging food and clothing ; many were
literally starved to death. Capital won the day, and the
men returned to work, six months later, under the new
and reduced order of things. More than one old emigrant
of the early ’sixties, now living in N.S. W., remembers the
Dudley Ward ironworkers’ strike.

Ho ! tie me a gage to my saddle-bow,
And fill me my drinking-horn ;

Then saddle me up my brave brown mare
For the quest of COUNTESS Smith.

This bank didn’t have the thorough cleaning- up that
some of them had after the great crisis, and there
were a lot of remnants to attend to afterwards. The dis-
closed earnings for some years were therefore poor. They
may have been actually better than the accounts showed ;
in that case the excess was used to write down values
that were sti 11 regarded as fictitious. Circumstances have
favored the bank. As late as 10 years ago the balance-
sheet showed an item “ Other real estate, at cost (less
£108,098 written off), £430,774.” Gradually that relic of
wild times has been got out of the road, either by sale or
by being written off out of profits, and to-day the
item stands—“ Other real estate, at valuation, £61,745.’*
Over £150,000 of this unsatisfactory item has been got rid
of in the last three years. Recently, having pretty well
cleaned up the “Other real estate” item, the bank has
been attending to the “Bank premises” account. For
years it stood at about £459,000 ; in the pr st.*uo balance-
sheet it stands at £437,307, and another £„000 has been
appropriated to write it down further. (By the way, since
various sums have been appropriated to write down
premises, why present the balance-sheet item thus—
“ Real estate, consisting of bank premises, at cost to the
Bank, £437,307 ”?) The bank’s earnings are still not so
large as to suggest that the assets are by any means
under-valued, and certainly the bank premises account
can do with a lot of pruning yet; but it is obvious that
much effective cleaning up of old wreckage has been done
in the past few years.
Profits calculated on the basis of capital and re-
serves combined have lately been as follows :
Mar., 1905 .. £4 9 7 p.c. Mar., 1907 .. £5 17 1 p.c.
Sept., 1905 .. 4 9 1 „ Sept., 1907 .. 6 0 1 „
Mar., 1906 .. 5 1 3 „ Mar., 1908 .. 5 1 5 „
Sept., 1906 .. 5 910 „ Sept.,l9oB .. 517 2 „
The last three lines are erratic ; apparently there has
been a pretty considerable shrinkage. But really the
fact is that during the last two terms profits have been
bitten into for various special purposes :

' ‘ ’ \ mises account.
As far as the accounts show, there has therefore been a
continuous upward movement in the matter of profits ;
it is only the special appropriations that spoil the look of
things to some extent.
Movements during the past 12 months* have
been as follows :

As in most cases, there has been an increase in
advances; in this case, however, there has been
also an increase in deposits, and that hasn’t been
a general experience. In the aggregate, Victorian
deposits (quarterly average for 11 banks) have
shrunk from £36,829,221 to £35,499,732 in the past 12
months; or, excluding Government deposits, from
£33,716,603 to £33,159,509. The National has, however,
its connection outside Victoria, and that has levelled
things up. On Sept. 30 it held 29 per cent, of its bor-
rowed money in liquid assets—a moderate proportion ; it
wouldn’t be satisfactory to see it go lower. In that
respect the Victorian banks seem to be disposed to take
more risks than those of the other States. Still, though
a bank needs a good cash holding to meet a sudden crisis,
two things govern the ultimate safety of the depositors’
money : (1) The proportion of shareholders’ funds to total
liabilities; (2) the quality of the non-liquid assets. As
to the former, assuming that the capital and reserves are
intact, then this bank only owes an almost exact £5 to
every £1 of the shareholders’ money; and that £1 consti-
tutes a very good insurance fund—a better fund, of course,
than if it had to protect £7 of depositors’ money.

The foregoing record starts from the half-year when the
ordinary shareholders got their first taste of dividends
after the boom smash. When that trouble happened,
part of the debt to the public was compounded for pref.
shares, of which there are 31,184 paid to £9 15s. each
(£304,044); the balance of the capital is in ordinary
shares—77,27B paid to £1 155., and liable for another
£2 10s. The pref. shares take the first 5 per cent. ; then
the ordinaries come in, but they all share alike if over 5
per cent, is paid. When the'pref. shares have got 14
divs. of 7 per cent, or more, their preference as to capi-
tal ceases ; but they still continue entitled to their first
5 per cent. As the above list shows, they haven’t yet
scored one towards the necessary 14 divs. of 7 per cent.
Except in one line there have been no great
movements during the year :
Sept., 1907. Sept., 1908.

The total debt to the public is thus £3,212,381; and the
liquid assets amount to £823,756, which represents only
26 per cent, of the liabilities. It is quite true that the
proportion of fixed deposits is rather large ; but even so
the percentage of liquid assets held by the bank
is too small unless there are special circumstances which
the accounts do not disclose. Considering that so much
of the available funds is at work, and that the bank has
very nearly £6 of the public’s money for every £1 of its
own in the business, the profit earnings are just moderate
they are certainly not so large as to suggest that the
assets are undervalued or that there are other hidden
reserves in the cupboard. The recent profit figures, on
the basis of capital and reserves combined, have gone like
this
Mar., 1905 .. £7 11 11 p.c. Mar., 1907 .. £8 3 8 p.c.
Sept., 1905.. 7 1 6 „ Sept., 1907.. 7 2 4 „

The reserves are moving along satisfactorily, but there is
still a good way for them to go before the capital can re-
gard itself as safe. Apart from the liquid assets there is
£2,977,296 out at risk—-in advances, premises, etc. If
that lot does not realise £2,977,296, then the share-
holders’ funds (capital and reserves) have to stand the
racket. Now the reserves represent only lOd. in
the £, or a trifle over £4 in the 100, of those
risks ; so that the shareholders’ reserves, which con-
situte the assurance fund for their capital, is only
capable of protecting the shareholders’ risks against
a slump of a shade over 4 per cent. Of course, this is not
enough for safety. That, however, is looking at the
matter from the shareholders’ point of view. The
depositors’ point of view is quite different. His capital
is protected by the shareholders’ capital as well as the
reserves ; so that he has a protection of about 24 per
cent. In other words, every asset (other than the cash,
etc.) could shrink from £124 to £lOO before the depositors’
money would be in danger.

Formed in 1888 this bank arrived rather too late to get
into the same trouble as most of the others. It had a
paid capital of £300,000, and by March, 1892, it had only
£433,678 of deposits. Moreover, it had always maintained
a large reserve of liquid assets ; so, having in consequence
a comparatively small proportion of advances, it was not
hit so severely by the slump in values. It had when
the trouble arrived practically only £2 of non-liquid
assets to every £1 of its own funds, while several other
banks had as much as £6 and £7 at risk for every £1 of
their own money. The Royal, a comparatively new bank
and possessed at the time of nothing much in the
way of prestige, was thus able to pull through without
locking up any deposits ; and that fact ought to make one
think. There is a tendency to go on piling up deposits
in banks which already are heavily weighted with them.
In some cases, the bank does something on its own
account by getting in more capital, and thus giving the
depositor more protection ; but there isn’t any sign that
the average depositor wants the bank to do it—from all
appearances, he would rather put his money into a bank
where the deposits are huge in proportion to capital and
reserves than in one where they are moderate.
* * * • •
. The Royal pulled through, then, not by penal-
ising depositors in any way, but by wiping out its re-
serves, by dropping dividends for four years and then
resuming them at 3 per cent., and finally by cutting its
capital down from £300,000 to £150,000. Since then
it has made steady progress, and throughout
has made large additions to its reserves. Further, con-
tinuing the same careful policy, it now issues 100,000
shares at 2s. 6d. premium ; this (a previous issue of 50 000
at ss. premium having been made) brings up the capital
to the old £300,000. Even without the new capital, the
debt to the public was only £4 3s. for every £1 of the
shareholders’ funds. That was a very substantial insur-
ance fund from the depositors’ point of view ; and the
inorease of capital makes it more substantial still.

Owing to the ebbing of the boom-tide, the deposits have
shrunk, while more accommodation has been sought by the
public j one result is that liquid assets now represent
only 29 per cent, of the liabilities to the public, which is
much less than this bank usually maintains. Still, the
directors no doubt had in view the early arrival of the
new capital. The earnings continue very good. These
figures show the return calculated on the basis of capital
and reserves combined :
Mar., 19C5 .. £7 16 6 p.c. Mar., 1907.. £lO 010 p.c.

Sept., 1906 .. 10 3 7 „ Sept., 1908 .. 10 1 8 ”
Assuming that only interest actually earned and recover-
able is taken credit for, these figures suggest that there
can’t be many unprofitable lines on the books. And the
return for the last two terms would be rather better than
they are but that fairly extensive head-office alterations
have been paid for out of profits not included above.

This bank is gradually pulling itself out of its difficulties.
Though it wrote off £1 per share, and called up £2 10s.,
making the shares £6 10s. paid, it never had a complete
cleaning up ; so that it unquestionably had a large
amount of bad debts to make good out of earnings. This
was not a satisfactory policy to adopt; it kept a lot of
fictitious figures in the balance sheet, and the necessity
to gradually work off the old dead horse practically com-
pelled the bank to show less profits than no doubt at
times it was actually making on current business. It is
highly probable that that same condition of things still
exists. The bank has invariably paid in dividends
in recent years almost the whole of the dis-
closed profits; and if the disclosed profits have
been the real profits, the management would
deserve to be spoken to very severely for laying by so
little. Looking at the table above it would certainly
seem that the Royal of Queensland’s was an improvident
management whose only concern almost was to pay divi-
dends ; yet there is very good evidence that it is 'by no
means that sort of management. The truth most likely
is that, knowing that there are no real reserves at all,
since the capital is not intact, the management hesitates
to pile up reserve " figures ;so it uses undisclosed profits
to write down the assets which ought to have been
written down out of capital long ago. The misfortune
is that, while this is being done, you get no idea of what
the real profits are : also you have no idea of the size of
the hole which still remains to be patched up.
On the basis of capital and reserves combined,
recent profits have been as follows :
Dec., 1904 .. £3 13 5 p.c. Dec., 1906 .. £4 2 11 p.c.
June, 1905 .. 314 1 „ June, 1907.. 4 5 5 „
Dec., 1905 .. 315 7 „ Dec., 1907 .. 412 7 „
June, 1996 .. 316 4 „ Sept., 1908.. 411 9 „
Owing to the issue of pref. capital, which apparently can
be taken up at any time, the last two or three lines are
only approximate. In a case of this sort, since there is
every reason to believe that the balance-sheet figures
don’t mean exactly what they say, one has to trust the
management to a very great extent. Presumably all
that the management intends to do is to give a general
indication of the way things are going, and the hint con-
veyed in tiie figures which work out as above can only be
one thing—that the assets are now a much more produc-
tive lot than they were.
The figures for two recent periods compare like
Dec., ’O7. Sept., ’OB.

Premises, etc. .. 63,712 63,458 Dec. 254
The balancing days have been altered lately ; the Royal
in that matter took a step which others might well
follow. The liquid assets represent a substantial 38 per
cent, of the total debt to the public. The capital is now
£492,252 ; this is made up of £454,994 ordinary capital
(£6 10s. per share paid), £11,458 ordinary prepaid capital
(this carries the ordinary dividend), and £25,800 pref.
capital. Even allowing for considerable over-valuation
of assets, the creditors are well protected by reason of the
large proportion of capital. On the published figures,
there is only a shade over £2 of the public’s money to
every £1 of capital and reserves; but some of that capital
is not supposed to exist. The market says the £6 10s.
shares are worth £4 15s. That means a discount of
£194,870, reducing the capital to £369,759 and wiping
out the reserves. Assuming that that represents the real
position, then the shareholders’ funds would still be equal
to £1 for every £3 3s. of the public’s money ; and the
security for deposits, etc., would still be very good indeed.

A few months ago Tiie Bulletin said that Tooth and Co.,
Ltd., would be issuing some new shares soon ; and,
though it was subsequently explained that the directors
had not dealt with the question in any way, it is still
pretty obvious that something of the sort is more than
probable. True, some of the big Tooth-family holders on
the other side of the world have, it is fairly well known
to brokers, been selling a large parcel of these shares;
but that is understandable enough. Anybody who lives in
England and is interested in breweries could hardly
have felt anything else but a bit nervous a few months
ago during the anti-beer excitement; and, in view
of the special licensing courts in N. S. Wales, they
probably concluded that the same anti-beer excitement
raged in N. S. Wales. There certainly is enough danger
in the air to lead to brewery investments being included
in the risky class, along with gassy coal mines, gun-
powder factories, wayback sheep stations, and such like ;
still, as far as they have got, the best of them are not
doing too badly. And Tooth’s is distinctly among the
best of them. It went along very cautiously in the
matter of paying dividends ; and its position (apart from
the general brewery risk aforementioned) has been made
one of unusual strength. This comparison shows in a line
or two the aggregate movements since September, 1900
Sept., 1900. Sept., 1908.

Less debts to public 10,938 21,276 Inc. 10,338
£378,134 £591,865 Inc. £213,731
This represents an increase in liquid assets of £159,863 in
eight years, notwithstanding the steady 8 or 10 per cent,
dividend. Moreover, in the same time book debts have
been reduced from £210,037 to £204,763; and though
that, of course, may be due to debts having been paid
off, it is also possible that it is due to undisclosed profits
being used to severely writedown everything that looked
at all like a doubtful debt. As a general thing, £5OOO
per half-year is appropriated to cover depreciation of
plant and machinery. Something besides is apparently
written off and charged direct to profit and less ; but the
amount is unspecified. The various items have moved
recently as follows :
1900. 1907. 1908.
Debts to public .. .. £10,938 £17,478 £21,276

Profit on brewing, rent,
etc 113,562 145,731 168,451
Management, wages, etc. 74,611 86,843 100,547
This, to some extent, is an amplification of the figures
previously given. It shows the gradual reduction of pro-
perties, goodwill, etc.; yet it will be noted that profits on
brewing, etc., don’t shrink, from which it, seems fair to
conclude that it is only in the books that properties,
plant, etc., have shrunk. Practically there is only one
point at which you can tap these accounts without
getting the impression that they are wonderfully solid ;
and that lone spot with the hollow sound about it is the
goodwill portion of the lumped item mentioned above.
How much goodwill stands for there is no way of finding
out; and it is as likely as not that it is kept there on
general principles, and for the sake of appearances. For
it doesn’t always pay to appear too prosperous.

For many years, from 1898 onward, this co. represented
Newcastle as a place with a thirst so even that if it had
been frozen over it could have been used as a skating
rink. Year after year just enough profit was disclosed to
pay the 4 per cent. div. and allow £3OOO to be written off
freeholds and plant—mostly £2OOO off freeholds and the
other £lOOO off plant. The fact, no doubt, was that the
co., which set off with too much paper (representing
goodwill) among its assets, had loaded itself up with
depreciated properties and doubtful debts ; and year by
year it had to make a large provision on this account.
Gradually the total of book debts has been worked down ;
and probably a great deal of old bad debt has been
replaced by newer debt, which so far looks and smells
better. This shows the movement in that and some other
respects:—

Receipts 61,716 52,922 54,371
Expenses (including- pro-
vision for bad debts).. 48,623 37,400 39,618
Sundry debtors stand for £26,175 less than they did seven
years ago ; how much of this has been paid off and how
much has been written off there is no way of telling.
It is a, good movement in either case. The amount of
goodwill in the lumped item “ Properties, buildings,
machinery, plant, goodwill, rolling stock, etc., £227,478”
is not ascertainable either ; and that is a weak point in
the situation, and no doubt largely explains why these £1
shares are quoted at anything from 10s. to 125., in spite
of the alleged reserves of £48,565. If the assets were
worth 20s. in the £ they would cut up for 235. lOd. per
share instead of about the market valuation of lls. 6d.
It seems to be a case where a cleaning-up is called for.
The position at present is that the public values this pro-
perty at a trifle under £150,000, while the balance-sheet
figures represent it to be worth £298,565 ; and either the
public or the balance-sheet is right off the target. And
when the public observes that for 11 years no more than an
annual 4 per cent. div. has been paid, and very little more
has been admittedly earned, then the public is justified
in saying that prima facie it is right, and the balance-
sheet is wrong. Which isn’t a satisfactory conclusion to
have to come to regarding any balance-sheet.

This curiously-named but consistent dividend-payer has
lately had its 21st birthday. Stray balance sheets avail-
able go back to the early ’nineties, when 5 per cent, was
being paid. The capital was then £9124 ; there have been
small increases since, and the capital now stands at 10s.
short of the level £lO,OOO. Ten years ago 5 per cent, was
still being paid ; ditto in 1900 ; but two years later 8 per
cent, was available. The co. has consistently written
down plant and rolling stock ; 5 per cent, is written off
the former and 10 per cent, off the latter each half-year.
The occasional bigger writing down shown above is in
connection with the freeholds. The co. has steadily built
up its holding of properties—presumably hotels—out of
undivided profits. This comparison shows how various
items have moved :

It appears to be a safe little business run on careful lines
■ —assuming, of course, that one regards investment in
pub. property nowadays as safe business at all. For the
pub. property £750 is pretty often paid for the building,
and £1250, or more, because it is licensed to be the habita-
tion of a beer pump ; and as one can’t be very sure what
will happen in these times to the beer pump, pub. values
are in constant danger. And even if nothing happens to
them, practically every brewing co. in the country has
to dip its hand into the till and pay something substantial
to a defence fund.

The old Federal is a-going it. It made a big splash during
the boom and a bigger splash when the boom broke and
the Federal fell with the others. In 1892, when the un-
pleasant splash occurred, it owed £389,939, chiefly money
received on deposit. Then for 13 long years it kept its
nose to the grindstone, but in 1904 it reckoned that it was
about time to look up and see if there wasn’t some new
business to be got. There were then on the books pro-
perties and other assets valued at £122,839 ; so a new
society was formed, with a capital of £96,351, which left
nominally £26,488 of reserves. The subsequent proceed-
ings are partly indicated above and partly below :

Properties in possession.. 54,071 32,924 26,252 20,124
Cash balances .. .. 4,779
The properties in possession were taken over from the
old society ; and there has been a fine clearing out here,
and at a profit, too, as the first table shows. Of the
property now in possession £7992 is vacant land; there
has been a fair reduction of that item since 1904, but not
proportionately so large a reduction as of the buildings
item. On the average the properties (including land)
bring in a shade over 3 per cent, gross ; the advances,
however, show about £7 Is. 6d. per cent, on the average
—and they don’t call for any outlay in rates;
moreover, the mortgage hasn’t got any gutter that leaks,
and it rarely requires a new door-handle. The wisdom of
exchanging the foreclosed properties for mortgages when
the opportunity offered is, therefore, pretty obvious.
What may happen to those mortgages in the future no-
body, of course, can say for certain ; but on present
appearances, and judging by the return they give, there
isn’t much the matter with them. The liabilities are still
not large, though they are increasing; so far, however,
the deposits total only £B996—most of the balance is
overdraft. No doubt deposits would be welcomed, and
there is excellent security for them ; but, in spite of that
excellent security, the society would probably find it a
good deal easier to get in public money if it put by more
to reserve, and wasn’t in so much hurry to rush up its
dividend.

Naturally, with such a small business, the loss rate is
uneven, and consequently the profits are erratic ; a couple
of fires more or less than the average makes all the differ-
ence. Generally speaking, however, the co.’s experience .
is favorable. In the past five years its premiums have
totalled £29,958, and the losses have been £10,622; so the
losses for five years have been only 35'4 per cent, of the pre-
miums, and there are only a couple of Australian offices
which can show results like that. On the other hand,
the expense rate is fairly high—the inevitable result of

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best solid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be
glad to supply further information to those interested.*

All philosophic works, and Holy Writ itself,
teem with warning of the uncertainty of life. Deaths by
natural causes have been pushed far down the years of
civilised life, but with the increase of that very civilisa-
tion the liability to accident has enormously increased.
The railway, the ferry, the tram, and the murderous
motor car inevitably cause thousands of people to place
their lives and limbs in the hands of entire strangers, of
whose ability they can have absolutely no knowledge. It
would seem, therefore, to be only common-sense to guard
against the financial consequences of misadventure by
taking out an accident and sickness policy with the South

The underwriting profit last year was thus £1569; and
only a shade under that much was added to the reserves.
For the previous few years the whole of the dividend was
paid out of interest; which means that more than the
total amount by which the premiums exceeded losses and
expenses was added to reserves, for the further protec-
tion of policy-holders. In five years the premiums have
exceeded the losses and expenses by £7450, while the
additions to reserves have been £7652 ; so that the
shareholders have not absorbed [uite all of even the in- •
terest earned by capital and other funds. However, the
dividend has now been put up t step, so it will probably
take a bite out of the under 'riting profit for a time.
The weakest feature of the cc.’s finance is that nearly
everything the co. has is out on mortgage ; and if any-
thing large and unpleasant struck the co. it might have
considerable trouble in speedily realising its securities
without making a serious loss. There are 37,500 shares
in the co. paid to £l, and liable for another £4. It is a-
very tidy liability for shareholders to carry about with
them ; but the reserves now amount to very nearly £1
per share, and that is a good insurance policy against
calls.

The recent labor crisis in Broken Hill surprised
some of the more conservative mine managers. A week
or two before the crisis the men talked about the im-
pending struggle over the wages agreement as calmly as
though they were ordering steak and onions ; and if any
eager individual mentioned “ strike” they simply smiled.
But no sooner had the word to “down tools” gone forth
than the whole body of workers bristled like the fretful
porcupine. It was boiling water that was in the pot.
And it is still boiling.
* * * *
Broken Hill people have become tired of asking
“ When is the British going to start?” Asa matter of
fact, when the mine was first closed down, the directors
intended to reopen when lead got to £l5 a ton. But
time has beaten the market, and lead doesn’t show any
sign of rapid recovery ; and now the directors are faced
with a labor trouble. So the probability is that the
management will continue pegging away at the develop-
ment in TJhompson section, and leave ore-extraction and
the arrangement of a contract for the sale of concentrates
to the future—which is always full of promise for a
mining man.

An inquirer named Beale, who seems to have
done his work carefully, has compiled a comparative
table of the position of the Boulder, Horseshoe, Ivanhoe,
and Kalgurli, which shows (1) that during 1905, 1906 and
1907 the four mines treated among them 2,082,198 tons
for £5,991,026, and distributed £2,677,500 in dividends ;
(2) that the present ore reserves approximate 9,000,000
tons, as against 8,500,000 three years ago ; and (3) that
the ore now in sight is sufficient to last 4J years at the
present rate of reduction.

Associated Northern (W.A.) has taken an
option on the Harbor Lights at Leonora. Some time back
8., M. and 00. took this show on appro., but after spend-
ing £ll,OOO they refused to buy it. Several lodes have
been exposed, and the Northern Co. intends to put in a
few bore holes to see how they shape in depth. So far
about 12,000 tons have been taken out of the property for
an average gold recovery of 12dwt.
Westralian State mining engineer Montgomery
visited Southern Cross the other day, and dug up the
interesting fact that, though Fraser’s is one of the oldest
and most constantly worked mines in the West, its
deepest shaft is only down 366 ft. To date this show has
produced £678,000, and its shareholders divided £24,000
in the ’nineties. Later on the shutters were put up, and
later still Vincent Shallcross, Boulder Hamilton and a
few' other wideawake persons came along and picked it
up for a few’ thousands. Since then they have got their
money back in tributors’ royalties, and a bit more
besides. Every now and then the local paper gets
annoyed over the dawdling, and asks the Government to
shake Shallcross and party up. So far, however, they
have escaped molestation. Fraser’s certainly has possi-
bilities if worked on a big scale ; but as this would neces-
sitate the expenditure of say £lOO,OOO, and as a doubt
exists whether the recoverable contents of the ore are
sufficient to justify such an outlay, capital is shy of the
proposition.
Peak Hill Goldfield (W.A.) shareholders are in a
bad way. The present Board took over 400 acres of ground,
representing £300,000 (the par value of the shares). It
has since issued £25,000 in preference shares, and has
pawned the area for £50,000 to the first debenture stock-
holders ; and now it has practically handed the whole lot
over to a few persons termed prior lien bondholders for
£10,004, of which the co. had at a recent date only re-
ceived £2501. If, as London papers state, no bondholder
can be legally compelled to pay anything further, this
means that the prior lien lot has its thumb on the whole
of the assets of the co. in return for the application
money. Unless things improve enormously shareholders
are pretty certain to be left out in the cold.
* * * *
Santa Claus, at Randalls (W.A.), is again on
the sick list. Some months ago it was estimated that
200,000 tons of payable ore were in sight above the 200 ft.
level; but since then all the money in hand, as well as
that derived from two calls and a crushing, has melted
away ; and the estimate is looking queer. This paper has
repeatedly said that the co. is more likely to want a
coffin than a strong room, and it still sorrowfully clings
to that opinion.

A syndicate, of which Charters Towers Mills is
the back bone, has been prodding the bowels of the earth
alongside the Mount Morgan deposit. After sending the
diamond drill through formations typical of the big mine,
the core brought up ore from 1200 ft., corresponding to
over 900 ft. vertical depth. The possibilities of the dis-
covery are great, and developments should be full of
interest.
* * » *
Charters Towers is in for a lot of exploration
involving hard work and a string of calls. The
Day Dawn reef having been proved in No. 7 level nearly
halfw'ay across, the New Brilliant Freehold has now be-
come the objective of the Brilliant Blocks. Its shaft has
been sunk below the Brilliant formation, which of late
years has given the Blocks an existence. The Towers is
famous for rapid shaft sinking, and Manager Harris,
lately of the Mexican, w'ho has taken over the New Bril-
liant Freehold, is the man to make things willing.
Whether the Day Dawn is a distinct formation from the
Brilliant has been much discussed, but the important
question is whether this series of ore shoots extends much
further east. With a face of stone 4ft. wide at the end of
No. 7 level, 520 ft. from the boundar3 r , the inference is
strong in favor of continued developments.
* * * ■*
East Mexican, Charters Towers, reported an
improvement in No. 5 level just before work was sus-
pended, owing to a machinery overhaul; and with No. 6
also at a standstill the market requires more proof that
No. 5 has at last intersected a main ore shoot and not a
patch, though a patch often means something more solid
further on. New Brilliant Freehold had also to stop
driving for want of compressed air. No. 7 was looking
well, and No. 8 on the improve. A rise above No. 8 seems
to have got through the poor zone, in which this level
for the most part has been driven. If No. 8 entered a
long shoot of ore similar to that in the upper level it
would inspire more confidence.
* * * *
Brilliant Deep, Charters Towers, is crosscutting
at a vertical depth of 2413 ft. on the track of the diamond
drill, which it was expected'to verify. But the reef was
very flat, so the borehole gave a misleading ’ idea of the
width of the reef. All the same, the market produced by
the good assays has not collapsed. Bonnie Dundee, which
pays a sixpenny div. next month, has an improvement in
the main level; but there are poorer prospects at the end
of No. 2 East intermediate. This mine has a good block
of ground to work, and a second, div. may follow. The
Buby crushed 474 tons for 13600 z., which is better than
the expected £8 per ton. The deepest level (No. 8) is in
60ft. east of the underlie, with 6in. of heavy mineral stone
in the face. The end of the Western level, however, has
only leaders in the formation. A sixpenny div. has been
declared.

“Billycan”: What has become of those good
judges who considered the No. 7 level in Mills United,
Charters Towers, was better than the No. 6 or No. 8 level
(B. 3/9/’08)? Quite a number of other things alleged by
those “ good judges,” re .the upper levels of Mills United
near the Mexican boundary, will yet be found all wrong.
Holders of Mexicans can rest assured that, just as No. 7
level is better than No. 8, and No. 6 better than No. 7. "o
will No. sbe better than'No. 6 when it is brought '. or on
to the right tack. It is interesting to note that, although
two levels and sundry crosscuts were necessary to pro-
spect and work Mills United and the Freehold, one poky
level is considered sufficient at No. 5, East Mexican, and
timid shareholders are induced to part with their
scrip because there is no reef in this level. An-
other very amusing incident is that a survey has
been ordered before the reef has by means of a crosscut
been located at the No. 5 level. That a survey under
such conditions is likely to be misleading is as obvious as
the probability that it will bring shares back to a splendid
buying price. It is marvellous how a few judicious sales
by the Mexican “bear” and a little extra limelight on
the poor prospects of the No. 5 level can hold Mexicans
back, whpn a magnificent crushing taken from their
foundations is so necessary to keep Freeholds good in the
market.

“Phoenix”: Two pars (8/10/’08) refer to the
reefs at the Two-Mile, Gympie. The Homeward Bound
and the Peter and Paul are mentioned as showing coarse
gold ; and, what is far more important, it is added that
the slate beds in which they are being worked are iden-
tical with the prolific slates of the famous Phoenix reefs.
After all these years, and the enormous amount of capital
and labor uselessly expended in testing the deep ground
in that locality, it is very gratifying that the Phoenix slate
should be discovered there and that prosperous times are
in store at last. But who is the authority for stating that
it is the Phoenix slate ? The second bed too ! The slate
formation of the Phoenix, Smithfield, Monkland and
Glanmire reefs have a gradual incline (similar to a coal
seam) in settled country, and are from two to three miles
distant from the Two-Mile. Besides, whilst these reefs
were well-defined and gave regular payable crushings for
years, the reefs at the Two-Mile were barren at a depth,
as the patches of gold-bearing quartz were got from the
shallow workings. The Bristol, Sadowa, London (the best
of the group), Chatsworth, Canadian, Homeward Bound,
Peter and Paul, and Hibernian were all of this character,
and the gold obtained near the surface was sunk in
testing the deep ground. The Peter and Paul (recently
floated into a co.) was . always next door to
a duffer, and, although referred to as showing coarse
gold,, its shares are still quoted at Is., with no buyers.
A reef showing coarse gold in the Phoenix second slate-
bed having no buyers at Is. —what are local residents
thinking about? There are some mighty shrewd specu-
lators there, too. The reports which have been published
re Great Northern almost make one’s month water ; yet
shares can be had for Is. 9d. —and no buyers. Now, Ido
not profess to be able to see through soiid rock any far-
ther than others, and should like to see a revival in the
prosperity of the locality ; but when informed that reefs
are showing coarse gold in the old settled slate forma-
tion of the. Phoenix, and then when I see the shares going
begging at,a paltry “bob,” I conclude that something is
wrong somewhere.

The product was a 47 per cent, matte, containing 14
tons of copper. (Note that the charge contained 40 tons
furnace bottoms. How much of the 14 tons of copper
came from this? And what of the ore supplies?) In
Welch’s stopes the ore is a “ little low grade in places.”
Judging from the above figures, it is doubtful whether
ore of a “little low grade ” is worth smelting. Develop-
ment Work has been suspended except at one point in
Welch’s. Fluxing ore seems to be the only material
there is plenty of—very desirable stuff too, if there is
anything to flux.

Unless something bad happens to the metal
market, Smith’s Greek (N.Q.) will probably re-open at the
beginning of 1909. If, as alleged, the ore is worth 2£ per
cent, tin, it ought to be a payable proposition if run in
the right wav. Mining has been done for 10s. ; milling
should not cost more than 10s. at the most; and, allowing
ss. for transport, realisation, and various expenses, there
would still be 10s. left on the 355. ore. The chief
stumbling block is the inefficient plant, which, although
costly to work, gives no satisfaction.

Croydon (N.Q.) has had still another set-back
owing to the poor opinion expressed by Government Geo-
logist Dunstan regarding the prospects of the Highland
Mary and Bennion’s Block. In the Highland Mary they
have to find stone ; in Bennion’s gold-stone was certainly
found beyond the break which up to that time had
marked the end of the field ; but Bennion, who tackled
the job single handed, was driven out by water. Now,
however, pumps are at work, and 84,000 gallons a day
are being got out; and within a few' weeks—by the end
of the year, at any rate—the shareholders who have had
to hand out 11 penny calls in quick time will get some
idea of the run they are likely to have for their money.
Their chances are not as horribly gloomy as the atmo-
sphere of the field, which is in a pitifully dead-beat state.
In the six months to the end of the first week in
October, Cathcart (Vic.) received £12,651 from gold won,
and spent £11,003, which showed a gross profit of £1648
for the term—a poor result in view of all the unprofitable
work that had been done to make ready the ground
which has lately been worked. From "first to last,
under this co., the outlay has been £38,248, and
the gold W’on has contributed only £26,446 of
that total. No mine has had more puffing; the
people who, bought at high prices W'ere induced to
forget all about the 20 years during which it had been
proved a heart-breaking sink for money. 8., M. & Go.
for a time had the idea that it was something else ; but
they dropped it. The people who follow'ed had the luck
to strike a good patch ; possibly they knew of its existence
beforehand. Judging from the way shares have been
supplied, it is very doubtful, though, whether some of
them ever had any confidence that it was anything more
than a patch.
» * * *
Cathcart has to pay on roughly 50,000 shares ;
and, seeing that ounce dirt for six months, with the
benefit of work done by 8., M. and Co., only led to the
earning of £l6OO profits, it is evident that divs. won’t
roll in. The mine is now stranded for nearly three
months to let the wash drain. Drives across the leads
from Nos. 4 and 5 shoots are reported to have collapsed,
due to the rotten ground. If so, the whole plan of work
wants re-modelling. The main level should be pushed
ahead and a block of the lead cut off 1000 ft. long. This
should be allowed to drain, and then tackled. To go on
as now rheans working the wash so wet that, even under
favorable circumstances, all the gold will be wanted to
pay exes.
•*■ • *
Latest figures from Duke and Main Leads,
Maryborough (Vic.), support all former experience that
well on the way to £lOO,OOO is needed to get a big deep-
lead mine going. This is how the money went at the
Duke and Main Leads: Machinery, £i8,000; wages,
£47,000; ' fuel, £17,600; ironmongery and timber,
£lO,OOO ; mine itself, £4505 ; and management, £3414.
Now the mine is in swing an idea can be got of what’s
ahead. First, the wash at No. 1 shaft has been tackled
seriously, so there is over 1000 ft. of fairly well-drained
ground to work. The wash at No. 6 rise is somewhat
patchy, and with a lot of cement. Still the average
grade of the dirt, so far, is nearly 17dwt., which leaves a
margin of profit. The co. is now financial and has a
strong Board to keep funds straight. Heavy outlay goes
on at the old Main Leads north shaft. Here the dirt is
worth under 13dwt., so that it is touch and go between
profit and loss. Things are not very encouraging at this
point, but luck may come when deep ground is got in the
west branch drive.
* •* * *
Maori Queen, Bright (Vic.), has always been a
dredging beauty that people squabble over. ’Way back
in Langford’s time it was boomed as big as the Briseis
Extended, and then it pretty well burst. The co.’s plant
is as old as dredging at Bright, so a new dredge is being
got to shift 7000 cubic yards a week. Why there should
be a fuss over the co. again just now no one is quite
clear, unless the reason is a lust of power by some of the
newer generation of shareholders. Costs with the old
dredge pan out at nearly £6O a week, while gold won
averages 28i0z., leaving a profit of a shade over £5O a
week, exclusive of renewals. The co. has tacked 65 acres
to its holding, and now has 410 acres to work, out of 460
held. It wants, not one new dredge, but two.
♦ * TT *
Forest Creek, Castlemaine (Vic.), put in a satis-
factory half-year with its two plants, considering that
No. 1 was short of water and in tough ground. Now it
goes into Hundredweight Gully, and better gold should
be ahead. Six acres gave 10670 z. This is a better average
than is got at Bright with the dredges, as the buckets
used there cannot get into the crevices and cracks. On
the other hand, costs at Castlemaine are twice as heavy
as they are at Bright, owing to the scraping and cleaning
work. Castlemaine dredging is less profitable than it
was, and there seems no chance of a revival, as most of
the good spots have been turned over—really for the last
time now.
• * * *
Surplus, £7 13s. sd. This is the mite that the
Briseis Extended (Tas.) flings on to the table to show that
the last copper has not been spent. As £6 10s. of that
sum is represented by outstanding calls which may not
be paid, the surplus comes down to £1 3s. 5d., or just
about enough for a round of drinks. With various trim-
mings cutoff, the position is—Tin and gold, £1664 ; debts,
£1943. This is not so bad as it looks, because a lot of
dead work has had to be paid for, the barge is
on good tin where the bores showed none, and pug
and clay have gone out of the face. The bottom drifts
don’t seem to have been turned over by any prehistoric
miner, and once a new blower is put in they should add
to the returns. There should be at least six months’ clear
run ahead, and as there is “ Up-lads-and-at-’em ” methods
about the management nowadays, the market would like
to see the show have a turn of luck.

A Melbourne co. is still nursing those great
Blythe River iron deposits to which Alex. Montgomery
drew attention when he was Government Geologist of
Tasmania. Years later, when William Jamieson hatched
his scheme for establishing iron and steel works some-
where near Sydney, preferably on the Parramatta,
the Blythe River deposits were to be the source
of supply ; but that great project fell through,
and by way of a 16th half-yearly report chair-
man Jamieson now merely has to say: “ Until
either a Bonus Bill or suitable tariff is passed, our policy
must remain one of inaction.” The co. has about £5500
in hand, and it reckons that that will see it through until
Australia wakes up. Meantime, the Lithgow (N.S.W.)
works, though they have got Government contracts at
special prices, find that the foreign imports are still
strangling them so far as general orders are concerned,
and this week 300 men have been put off temporarily.
* * * *
“Quidam”: Apart from the bad people who
steal gold and the worse people who illicitly buy it, there
is a steady feeling of resentment in Victoria against the
Gold Buyers Act and the politicians who passed it. No
one who knows anything, and who has no axe to grind,
denies that a great deal of gold stealing has gone on, and
apparent^'still is going on ; but what rankles is that the
outcry against gold stealing should be used as an excuse
for extracting more revenue from an industry which was
already shedding about as much as it could spare. For
instance, there are in Victoria hundreds of men run-
ning little cyanide plants, either employing labor
or doing their own, and against whom there has been no
suspicion or hint of gold-buying. From these very small
men there are various gradations, up to the big mining
cos. ; and almost without exception the reputation of the
proprietors was spotless. Under the Act, however, in-
stead of receiving licenses to smelt their gold at a nominal
fee, each license carries a fee of £1 per annum, and if a
cyanider has two or more plants, he must procure a
separate license for each plant, while if the area is not in
his own name (as would be the case were he a lessee or a
tributor, as he often is) he cannot obtain a special license
at all.

Seecomb, a contractor at Dunolly (Vic.), while
sinking a post-hole the other day, unearthed a 440 z.
nugget. It was in this district that Victoria’s largest
mass of the precious metal was discovered, and then also
the finder was sinking a post-hole. Leeson was the finder,
and the nugget was the Welcome Stranger, which brought
£9OOO. There seems to be luck attached to post-holes.

A very substantial English co. is being formed
to work the Woodside gold mines (S.A.). A few shares
have been put aside for Adelaide consumption, but it is
said that flotation in London was assured anyhow. The
success that the Kittieoola mine (Reedy Creek) has been
getting lately has turned English attention favorably to
the often-abandoned mines in the S. Australian “Hills”
country. Metallurgist Opie, who abandoned the Mitchell
River gold-antimony proposition under the remarkable
circumstances already described, is now managing the
Kittieoola.

Miss Clara Kleinschmidt, a Lobethal (S. A.) girl
of 18, for whose contralto voice Ada Crossley prophesies
great things, is to have the same distinction as Gilbert’s
Duke of Plaza Toro, and be floated into a company. Ade-
laide, always ready for a promising gamble, has put up
£lOOO to take her to Europe. In return, she binds herself
for 10 years to the shareholders, her total earnings to be
thus allotted : (1) The first £3OO a year for herself ; (2)
the next £lOO to go in reduction of capital; (3) of every-
thing above that the shareholders are to get one-fifth as
profit.

“ G.M.H.” (who is a girl) writes :
The quaint assaults upon Socialism made at the just-
dispersed Women’s Congress remind me. During the last
Federal elections I was staying in Gippsland (Vic.). The
station dames of those parts, when not engaged assailing
each other’s moral characters or making patchwork quilts
for the Chinese mission, used to discuss politics and read
“papers” on “ The Keeping Down of the Working Classes,”
and so on. As election day approached politics took pre-
cedence over slander as a topic of conversation, and the
Chinese quilts were laid aside. The atmosphere grew
quite electric. I asked the leading politician of the band
who she meant to support one day. “ Oh, I shall vote by
the Argus,” she said. “You know the Age is for the
Labor party.” The spirit of untruthfulness entered into
me, and I replied : “ But the Age and Argus are both
run by the same man. They only take opposite political
sides to be sure of getting everybody’s pennies.” The
poor old thing got quite hot and unhappy. “Well,” she
said, miserably, “if that’s so, I sha’n’t vote at all.” There
were five worthy dames at the least in that district who,
to my certain knowledge, “ voted by the Argus.” They
all believed that, if the Labor man won, the banks would
be invaded arid looted by scoundrels in bowyangs, also
that their homes would be destroyed and the Christian
faith displaced in favor of atheism. And in the end the
Labor man did win—and the curious thing is the banks
are intact, and the local homes still stand, and religion
has not been injured or even assailed. Wasn’t it funny—
or was it sad ?

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, October 27, 1908.
My Dear Arint,—
Miss Grace Watson has gone back to Melbourne,
leaving Sydney dizzy at the recollection of the
amount of work and pleasure she was able to
digest. (River picnics, morning teas and garden
parties come under the label “pleasure,” I
suppose.) She has nothing to complain of as
regards Sydney’s press. It treated her conference
well, but with a tinge of amused tolerance. Con-
sidering the ridiculous ‘ ‘ Mrs. Smith ” yarn, it could
hardly do otherwise. The delegate from Jeetho,
in Gippsland (did anyone ever hear of Jeetho till
now ?), was a good dresser, and exploited a peach
of a Merry Widow coat. Another delegate from
(xippsland was good to the drapers here, and wore
pretty frocks, and some of them (the delegates, not
the frocks) had their hair waved to the minute. In a
pause of the conference work Dr. Arthur handed
over a number of letters from English women
who were said to be desirous of emigrating to
Australia, and to these inquirers Miss Watson will
reply. . One girl who wrote said that she and her
sisters lived in a village of 800 inhabitants, and
there wasn’t an unmarried man in the population.
I here were several families, seven strong, of
grown girls, nice young women who would come
under the awful designation of “ladies.” The
writer further explained that domestic service for
her and ner girl friends would mean ostracism in
their own country, but they would willingly under-
take that or nursery-governessing in Australia,
bhe wanted information and guidance. There
must be thousands of this sort of girl in caste-
ridden England, and if the Eeague will but
send Miss Watson and her friend “Mrs. Smith”
there to yard them for Australia, this country will
forgive the League for some of the horribly foolish
papers that were perpetrated here under its name,
and which it couldn’t even read intelligently.
That much-paragraphed person, Mr. Arthur
Mahaffy, passed through Sydney last week on
Ins way to the Solomons, where the boiled mis-
sionary is kept on the sideboard. Miss Beatrice
Gnmshaw went by the same vessel—the Moresby.
All well-frocked Sydney went to “Glen-
J-rrah, to Mrs. Bertie Kelly’s garden fete in aid
-A.ll baints Church, WoolJahra. One hundred
beautiful sovereigns were realised.
A crowd of well-known Sydnev-siders leave for
foreign parts at the end of the year. The Darleys
are going, so are the “Fiona” Knoxes, and their
house will be taken by the Macarthur Onslows.
Mrs. J. 1. loohey is another intending goer. To
balance these departures, the Lucas Tooths will
return to Sydney at Christmas. The lady is said
to wear the latest in clothes.
A fellow passenger of Lady Dudley’s is Mr.
Lroctor, the gentleman who is supposed to have
started his voyage with the intention of appro-
priating that blessing in skirts, Carrie Moore.
Mr. Henry Montague Faithfull, who died last
week, was the father of that ornamental damsel,
Miss Pearl Faithfull, who used to act the good
fairy sister by Grace Palotta. Her stature and
her fathoms of fine red hair make her a huge
success in theatrical tableaux of the “Queen
Elizabeth” and “The Sea Hath its Pearls”
variety, and in mere human or fleshly tableaux on
sea beaches where bathers breast the surf and
swallow pints of ocean, and come up gasping.
The above mention of Queen Elizabeth reminds
me that films showing that ruddy Queen and her
beautiful rival, Mary of Scotland, at different
phases of their wild career, are on the screen at
West s Pictures. When Mary is escaping down a
desolate mountain slope after the battle of
Langside, Elizabeth, correctly dressed and
ruffed, but not hatted or crowned, rushes up
with a horde of minions and helps to take the
g ? l G en ' haired one P risoner - But it is at the trial
of Mary (according to West) that we see the best
stage effect. Elizabeth, well in the foreground,
presides at the trial (West treats history as glaziers
do putty), and after the sentence Mary marches
down, draws herself to her full height of
about nine feet, clenches her little hand
across her black velvet bodice, throws up
her chin, and looks contempt and defiance
at her rival. You can almost hear her hissing the
word “Ginger!” Once in real life I saw one
woman cut ’ another. It was done after the
best traditions of factory girldom. The cutter was
a small fat party, and she jerked her short skirts
and her chin sideways with a simultaneous move-
ment, and at the same time pushed up her lower
lip, and cast down her eyelids as if she meant to
drop them on the floor. Then she said “Honk ”
like a motor car. The “cut” party, shaking with
inward laughter, did not recover in time to reply
“Toot.”
Another film shows Johnson, the colored stoush-
merchant. As Lady Dudley has presented him
with a breast-pin for being the best-dressed man
on board the liner on which she travelled, he
really must be threatened with intelligence.
Perhaps he appeared at the ship’s fancv-dress ball
as a cake-walker. In that character he would
probably deserve the pin. Johnson’s “ high ball ”
talk at Fremantle is a beautiful pretence of per-
sonal feeling against Tommy Burns. Squires and
Burns talked as if they didn’t love each other
even in step-brother fashion, but the night after
the fight Mr. Squires dined with Mr. and Mrs.
Noah Brusso. The incident was not mentioned
by the Society papers.
The stork’s beak-1 uggage deposited last week
with the Alec Gordons (she was Miss Margaret
Thomas) was a son.
The most striking bit of young womanhood at
present decorating Sydney ’is Mrs. Gouriet, wife
of Victor Gouriet, who gets himself up like an
old faun to play the Ambassador in “ The Merry
Widow.” Slie isn’t of the starved type on which
the empire or directoire gowns hang to such un-
speakable advantage. Her favorite fixings are
pale tan frocks, cerise edgings, and a black hat on
wonderfully red hair—just such a head of hair as
Lovey Mary wears in “Mrs. Wiggs.” Lovey
Mary’s may have been a wig, but, if so, it was the
wig of the Cabbage Patch, and a beauty. But
Mrs. Gouriet’s is undoubtedly the home-grown
article.
An imposing group of distinguished merchants
came together at the Australia Hotel on Monday
afternoon to tell Mr. A. H. Norman, of Gavin
Gibson and Co., of their sympathy with him
in the recent vexatious litigation into which
he had been forced. Mr. David Storey,
from his eminence in the chair, made
a genial and sympathetic speech, and the toast
of the guest was supported by Mr. Alec Thomp-
son, of Mosman, who incidentally mentioned that
the musical growth of Mosman was mainly due to
Mr. Norman’s efforts. The presentation of an
illuminated address and a gold watch backed the
appreciatory speeches.
Most of Sydney’s pretty young women who
can afford it are exodussing, or have already
exodussed, to Melbourne for the Cup. A few
will enjoy free board and “scoff’’with friends
(Mrs. Herbert Marks, for instance, is to be put up
by the Willy Kellys), but the majority are hasten-
ing to long-booked rooms in the Yarra-side
hostelries.
Dr. Tange, of Mosman, was married last week
to a Mosman pretty—a Miss Harden.
Lady Cynthia Almina Constance Mary Need-
ham, who is about to wed Viscount Villiers, ex-
Governor Jersey’s eldest son, is daughter of
Francis Charles Needham, who, as Viscount
Newry, visited Australia in the ducal Edinburgh’s
suite in the ’sixties. When here he was heir to
bis grandfather, Earl Kilmorey, an Irish peer of
County Down. He came into his kingdom in
1880, so F. C. Needham is now Earl Kilmorey
himself, which same is pronounced Kilmurry, and
don t you forget it. The rather ancient peer (he
is 66) is said to have 46,000 acres of land. It is
understood that the meek shall inherit the earth,
but they seem to have to wait a long time before
coming into their property, and meanwhile the
Kilmurry class is using the earth for all it is
worth.
Sir Harry Rawson and suite put up at Coolan-
gatta on their trip through the South Coast dis-
tricts. Coolangatta is the ancestral seat of the
Hay family, and a very pleasant place to sit down
in it is, too, by all accounts. Apropos of which I
often wonder if ourGovernorsand their hosts realise
that in these fleeting visits minor history is being
made, and a theme given for unlimited lying on
the part of future generations. “ Here,” one con-
ceives young Mac Smith saying haughtily to some
upstart friend a couple of hundred years hence,
is the Blue Room. It was at this identical table
my ancestor won four bob from the State
Governor of the day. The Governor’s name was
either Carrutliers or Bigwood; I have for-
gotten which. The game was a now extinct one,
named Bridge. The Gov. settled with an I 0 U,
which he never redeemed. There it is in the
frame over the electric stove. We would not part
with it for a fortune.” And so on. When Charles
11. insisted on butting into some loyalist mansion
during the troublous period of his life, and so
laying the owners open to proceedings for harbor-
ing him the while he made violent love to anv
skirted thing that crossed his grip-radius, the
romantic interest of his presence went unap-
preciated. The same remark applies to Queen
Elizabeth, Henry VIII., and other sovereigns who
sped from place to place and put up at their
subjects’ abodes in the intervals of speeding. It
is to be hoped that our indigenous nobility with
the example of history behind them will not err
in this fashion. The cigar the contemporary vice-
regality said he’d be blanked if he smoked, the
old and useless pair of boots that he stowed
furtively behind the wardrobe ere departing,
the pool-ball which he drove through the billiard-
room window in an earnest attempt at a “long
pot,” will all have points of absorbing interest to
coming generations. The modern who aspires to
win the regard of posterity will attend to these
matters.
I looked in at “Diana of Dobson’s” just in
time to hear the bounder knight of the piece
ask Diana “’Ow would you like me for a
usband ? ” and didn’t find Miss Brune a bit
objectionable in the part of the London shop-
girl. She looked well, too, frocked in buttons and
some brown, clinging, silky material. Buttons to
right of her, buttons to left of her, both
arms outlined with buttons from shoulder to
wrist, buttons at the back of her waist, and
before her from neck to skirt-
hem. She looked quite pretty, and if she didn’t
wear a cabbage of blue ribbon under her
ear she would look prettier. It thickens her neck
and has naught to balance it on the other side.
Yet if she wore another chou under the other ear
she d look like a pony when it wears those rosettes
which we know so well in equine garnishings.
Mrs. Brough—a cerise and blade Mrs. Brough—
looked stronger and better than of yore ; and
Kingston is it possible any man, even in London
society, could look and act so like an imbecile and
not have a keeper lurking in the shadows of
Aunty’s drawing-room?
A mostly feminine audience was asked, on
Saturday night last, to credit that Diana could
frock herself in Paris gowns and things from
head to foot on the paltry sum of £3OO, and be
able, moreover, out of the change to put in a
month at a hotel in the Swiss Engadine. The
idea is as preposterous as anything that has yet
been written in an Anti-Socialist “paper.”' A
Doucet, Redfern, or Worth confection is liable
at any time to cost a couple of hundred
pounds on its lonely own. It could
not possibly come to a maravedi less
than 25 or 30 sovereigns cash down. “Paris
models ” in the way of blouses vary between five
and 10 guineas. Hats touch the 20-guinea mark
with appalling frequency, and no self-respecting
establishment on the correct side of the Seine
would dream of stocking one of less intrinsic worth
than a five-pound note. A female with shaky
grammar and a desire to be taken for the possessor
of £3600 a year could not inhabit a Swiss health
resort with less than (say) a dozen frocks and a
like number of skull coverings. Remains the
question of boots, shoes, convincing toilet-table
fixings, jewellery, and above all, “undies.” The
last item alone would, at a moderate estimate,
swallow up half of Diana’s £3OO. There are
but two brands of “undies” known to Parisians
—the right sort and the “other sort.” The
“ other sort” are moderate in price, but the wear-
ing of them by a travelling widow, genuine or
shaln, is tantamount to social felo de se so soon as
the other maids’ maids shall have inspected them,
and reported on their quality at headquarters.
The right sort are the most ruinously expensive
items in all haberdashery. Provided Diana’s
trinkets were the cheapest class of Parisian goods,
she might conceivably have got the collection she
sports nightly at the Royal for between £5O and
£lOO. But I doubt it. Anyhow, the modern
health-resort frequenter is an expert judge of
paste, and a shameless hand at begging the sus-
pected gaud from its owner, and—under a hypo-
critical mask of admiration—subjecting it to a
rigorous examination. No; Diana never fitted
herself out and achieved that glorious month on
£3OO. It is one of the few intelligence-scorning
items in a clever play.
The name of Diana reminds me that I’ve just
read Mrs. Humphrey Ward’s latest, “ Diana Mal-
lory.” Diana is such an impeccable gentlewoman.
And she couldn’t be a Mrs. Ward heroine if she
wasn’t puddling in politics. But it is a book that
holds, and the writer is at her best when she’s on
the analysis of human motive. Also Diana has
“ deep blue eyes,” then she has “short-sighted,
intense brown eyes.” It is useful to be able to
change your eyes to match your frocks and hats.
Good news for the melomaniaes: Katharine
Goodson will play with the Amateur Orchestral
Society on her return to Sydney next month.
At the Musical Festival meeting in the Town
Hall, H. N. Southwell fired a bomb in the shape
of encouraging letters from some great guns of the
musical world. The new G.-G. agreed to be-
come patron, and in rapid succession letters
were read from Lady Northcote (with a fiver),
Kubelik, Canon Duckworth (who wrote from
County Cork), Melba (whose letter had a world-
known coronet on top), Lady May Trefusis (well-
regarded as Lady May Lygon), and from
Dolores, who sent four pages from Amsterdam-
four pages of common sense and kindliness, say-
ing she would feel it an honor if the committee
would accept her services to sing at the opening
concert.
Someone writing about the frocks of Alice
Crawford (the Bendigo actress in London) in a
new play mentions that one of her gowns has
buttons from the throat to the hem. Which
reminds that the blue silk matinee gown in which
Ada Crossley made her last appearance in Sydney
had big, blue silk buttons set closely together back
and front, from one pole of the garment to the
other.
Some interesting criticism of actresses’ com-
plexions appears among the London advts. of
Helena Rubinstein, that remarkable Russian girl
who started a skin-food business in Australia, and
has extended it to all the big cities of the earth,
seemingly. The advt. professes to quote from a
lecture given by the skin-food lady before a
Viennese Society of Actors :
Now while I have already mentioned that the fineness
of the skin-fabric of actresses is a noteworthy fact that is
largely due to the abundant lubrication it receives, it
would, speaking with all frankness, be a vain endeavor to
look for healthy, fresh skin-color among them. And this
leads us to the con. of the grease-paint question. The
lubricants used, being inert, inactive, bland, and in-
different substances, not only fail to stimulate the skin
to properly throw off the injurious effects of the pig-
ments, but they depress and flatten it. as it were. This
circumstance more than anything else in the theatrical
life is responsible for the typical tired face of the actress.
This Suggestion of cause for effect is merely inci-
dental to an advt., and, possibly, is specious non-
sense, but it certainly gives the “actress” face a
true complexion. With few exceptions the stage
woman who has passed 30 is a tired or faded
looking charmer. And this appearance is doubt-
less due, mainly, to the grease she rubs into her
face skin, and which serves to fill up the pores and
give a fineness to the “fabric,” as the advt. de-
clares. But there remains the question as to
whether grease by any other name will act differ-
ently towards the complexion. It may smell
sweeter in its character of skin food, but it con-
tinues to be grease.
“ Mario ” writes from Brisbane :
The day this gets into print, or is published in the dust-
bin, the Chelmsford lord and bis liege lady, flanked by the
smileful Verney, will be in your midst, going in search of
the Cup that cheers when the favorite comes in first, and
groans miserably when it doesn’t.
It’s a queer, topsy-turvy world, and most things seem to
happen “ reversally speaking,” as the lady remarked in
“ Davy and the Gobelin.” Therefore, it is not strange to
find that among the energetic people who are to reform
the milk trade, save the babies’ lives, and strike terror into
the heart of the destroyer of the infant Australian,
few have ever possessed a nearer infant relative
than a nephew or niece. Spinsters, doctors femi-
nine and single, doctors male and single, and mar-
ried doctors who are “without encumbrance,”
as Ann Gwendoline of the kitchen is expected to be else
she won’t get the job, and a few celibate clergy are in
the van of the battle and the forefront of the feeding-
bottle. It’s the same with the new Child Study Associa-
tion, which teems with unappropriated treasures and
clergy (can this be the cause and effect ?), while in the
local Ministering Children’s Deague there are more
bachelor-ladies than infants.
The Chelmsford lady presided over an erratic meeting
of the said Child Study Association this week, and
listened with patience and resignation to a long-wdnded
paper on how to train the young mind. Judging by the
manners of her own infants, however, she could give the
lecturer points.
Rumor is strong again this week touching the matter
of a master for the newly-acquired marble halls in
London, which constitute the premises of the Agent-
General for Queensland, and some say that handsome
Mrs. Joey Bell will yet attain her ambition and reign
therein.
Among Brisbane visitors to your harbor side this week
are Mr. and Mrs. Sc-hleussener. The latter was better
known until Wednesday last as contralto Haidee Lamb, a
sweet-voiced singer who somehow never got her full
share of recognition. And, talking of such things, I hear
that a certain local girl doctor, who is at present attend-
ing the Medical Conference, is about to throw up the
medicine bottle and the amputating implements in favor
of the domestic sausage machine. She does this at the
earnest request of a brother in the profession.
Attorney-General Blair (or he was such up till Friday)
opened the picture show of the new Society of Artists in
the crumbling walls of the council chambers. It’s a
strange show, wherein the very good and very bad
are jumbled together cheerfully. That the bad is bad
there’s no denying, and a portrait of James himself belongs
more or less to this category ; but the good spots are very
good indeed, and the work of Wirth, Elliott, and others
is refreshingly Australian, and cheerful Australian at that.
On the whole, the show proves the seriousness of the loss
sustained by the old society, while in point of popularity
it beats the ancient institution hollow.
Quite a lot of voyagers are turning their faces home-
ward this month. Miss Winnie Hicks and her father,
as wdl as the Collins clan-which has been buying Miss
hiHnn Ma t°u S Palnte(l ° hma at the Franco-BriUsh Exhi-
bition will cross over to America and reach home per the

things are not what they seemed, and they really look as

Mrs. Kidston, Premieress of Queensland, had a special
suiprise packet awaiting her upon her recent home-
coming. A maid had been installed—a luxury the frill-
less, domesticated little Scotchwoman had never previ-
ously possessed. She had hitherto done all her own
housework.

PIANOLA
PIANO.
“ Never in my whole life have I received a present which gives me so
much pleasure.”— From a recent letter which is typical of many.
The pleasure derived from a Steck Pianola Piano begins with the very moment it is placed
in the home. It continues each and every day of the year. The whole family can enjoy it, and
even the giver himself will take pleasure in it.
The popularity of the Steck Pianola Piano as a gift is witnessed not only in the great
demand for it, but also in the many imitations with which the market is now crowded, yet none
of which contain the important features that have made the Pianola the standard instrument of
its class throughout the world.
The Pianola Piano is an upright piano of the highest grade, and in addition contains within
its case a complete Themodist and Metrostyle Pianola, the only Piano-playing device endorsed
by the greatest living musicians.
It can be played by the fingers on the keyboard in the usual way.
It can be played by means of a Pianola action within its case.
There is nothing to move up in front of the keyboard. To change the method from hand-
playing to Pianola-playing it is only necessary to slide back a panel in the front of the case and
insert a perforated roll of music. ... ,
There is no outward indication which catches the eye to distinguish the Pianola Piano trom
the heretofore type of Pianoforte. . . ,
A cordial invitation to call is extended to everyone who may be interested in hearing tne
Pianola-piano, irrespective of any intention of purchase.
If unable to call, write for Catalogue C. It will be sent free for the asking.

The Vic. Minister for Public Works had
one of his slack days lately, so a few of the Vic.
country shires took an opportunity of looking him
up, just for old acquaintance sake. There were
13 of them in all, and, while spouting apropos of
nothing, or something less than that, thev were
struck with an idea. It was sudden and unanim-
ous. It had occurred to them that, while they
were on the premises, they might as well ask the
Government for a trifle. It was probably more
from habit than necessity, but here is the trifle :
Mildura, £250, road works ; Tungairiah, £lOOO, road
repairs ; Omeo, £ll5O, bridge repairs ; Avon, £5O, road
works ; Sebastopol, £250, channelling ; Upper Yarra,
£4090, roads and bridges; Newham, £2OO, bridge;
Benalla, £lOOO, road repairs; Chewton, £9OO, roads and
bridges ; Mfc. Franklin, £l5O, road; Woorayl and Nar-
racan, £707, road ; Mirboo, £1675, roads ; Buln Buln,
£3220, roads and bridges, and £5OO, drainage works.
That was all. They merely requested that the
city taxpayer should make them a present of
£15,142j and, as Bent wants every vote he can
secure, they will probably get it. Adolphus must
placate them or burst his boiler.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 26, 1908.
My Dear Yarrik,—
The announcement of the death of Mrs. John
Grice, mentioned last week, was a most regret-
table error. It can only be hoped that the lady
will now enjoy an. extra long and happy life, by
way of compensation for the mistake.
Henley on the Yarra is growing. It had the
benefit of perfect weather this year ; but that was
not responsible for all. The crowd was thousands
bigger than before, and the innovation of shunting
houseboats and reserves to the other side of the
river gave the swarms room not only to
tnove, but to show-off. The women’s frocks
went almost one better than those they displayed
at the races. The far side of the river—owing to
steady years of honest improvement—is now a
grassy terrace, with rose gardens and shrubberies
within, and the fine tan curve of Alexandra
avenue without. It all made a beautiful
and un-Yarra-like approach to the houseboats.
These have grown in .number and gorgeosity.
Even the backgrounding rocks that wall the summit
of the terrace put on Henley garniture. They
are covered with that tenacious little creeper that
only shows its flowers in the sun. Children call it
“ pig face.” I struggle with its true name, which
is Mesembryanthemum, because, like Meso-
potamia, it has a comforting sound. Anyhow,
the mesem-etceteras roused . themselves in the
glorious sunlight to colors like soft Persian rugs
hung over the balconies of Heaven. Grassy ter-
races and beautiful frocks and the heaps of pretty
girl had not only this wall for a frame, but also
the green upward sweep of reserves and gardens
that hold Government House on their summit.
The Carmichael,Governor people had a houseboat
on their blue-and-golden own. The Alexandra
Club—which is the high-toned Woman Club—
covered its watery abode with vast derangements
of red, red roses. ' The Australian Club wore
pale, anaemic blue. Mrs. Donald Mackinnon
and Mrs. L. K. S. Mackinnon had rival
boats on either side. The Wallabies just
shrieked in yellow—hot, mustardy yellow.
The Bohemians gave a modest,little echo in pale
primrose with lilies round about. The Medical
Congress boat—with a heavy list to port through
having too much grey matter on that side—
.shouted in red—blood red. The medicoes like the
color; it reminds them of well-paid operations.
And so on went the houseboats, way round the
curve.
The small craft on the river were every-
thing and anything—smart little motor launches
that whizzed about ; boats weighed down with
girl till they draggled their decoration petticoats
in the water; paddle canoes and everything
that would float, decorated in some carnival
way to hide the clumsy old timbers. The just-
returned Clegg girls' drooped on pink cushions
dressed in Early Victorian gear—but the boat was
plain Bill and undecorated, and the languorous
maidens looked forlorn and out of their .century.
The smartest motor launch out was the Ermerance.
I took its name and number in order that I
might report its disgraceful behavior. , It
was the only boat without a girl. In fact,
it was chock-full of Man—black crow-like
man—and it dashed past everything else
like a swallow. No one Seems to have discovered
yet who was the magnificent Titian-haired
goddess in Wedgwood blue who lounged among
blue and white cushions under a blue parasol.
She and the lucky man who rowed her had the
boat to themselves, and there were some few
glasses pointed that way. The Athertons, with
much red about their furbelows, had Jack
M‘Comas rowing. Otto Linden’s beauty daughter
sailed in pale cool blue, with Harry Whiting as
attendant swain. Sporting Bob Whiting was
hosting on the Athenaeum Club houseboat,
the most perfectly-appointed craft on the river.
It was bedecked in blue and brown by day, and
showed masts and headlights and an outlining of
blue and gold electrics at night. The pretty
Chicago girls wore blue and brown, and ladled ou t
the cooling ice or “something warmer.”
Much visiting went on from one boat to another,
and the Savage Clubbers, who have their coming
theatrical show to advertise, took possession of an
effective strip of terrace for their tent—a terrifying
place with scalps and masks and clubs and horrid
knives hung at the entrance.
At night, Henley forgot it was playing on the
plain old brown Yarra. All the terrace was
lighted, and on the slopes deck-chairs spread
themselves like yacht sails on a holiday after-
noon. A huge searchlight played about to help
craft in danger, and the houseboats blinked in soft
radiance. The big masses of crowds on the unre-
served off-bank looked like a mosaic or a carved
wall of white faces and color. On the river there
were no spare inches, except round some sputter-
ing, spitting rockets that had a base in the centre.
Everybody on the small craft alternated the
slow shove down the crazy carnival stream with
supper parties on the houseboats. It always
meant climbing a bridge of intervening boats to
get there. It was the night of the Petticoat.
The girl who was not trimly clad shoeward or
without something particularly fetching and frilly
in underskirt simply had to moan in a back seat.
Yet in the daytime Fashion has doomed the fasci-
nating ruffles of Petticoat. It exists no more
with the sheath of day dress, and tights and silk
socks push it into the background at night.
But it had its revival at Henley.
The Athenaeum Club added to its other hospital-
ities by engaging half-a-dozen motor-launches for
tripping its guests down the river, and a fascinat-
ing little boatload of singers in mask and domino
was anchored at the steps to make sweet music.
I think I recognised Baritone Turner, and a red
mask and domino sounded very like the warble of
Topsy Conn. They had violins to accompany
them, and even a small pocket affair that may
have been a harpsichord.
The inaugural meeting of the Medical Congress
on Monday afternoon was at the University. The
meeting that followed in the evening was a semi-
social affair in the Town Hall. It was social in-
asmuch as womenkind were invited. They all
sat in rows on chairs and listened to Governor Car-
michael, Minister Swinburne, and President Pro-
fessor Allen talk at length against a background of
important medicoes —a grim black wall on the
platform. Lady Carmichael and Mrs. Prof. Allen
sat at their feet. Wives and medical husbands
filled the hall to its farthest wall, except in the
south gallery, where nurses, like a host of white
angels, sat arrayed in white uniform and a sancti-
fied odor of iodoform. The night was as cold as
the top of a charitable iceberg. The paper Prof.
Allen read was long—very long. It was also in-
teresting—fascinatingly so to those who could hear
—but the voice did not carry well to the back bal-
conies. Some people, wedged in there with cold
feet and ears spread out like angels’ wings to
catch something of the discourse, got tired and
sneaked out quietly to a warm Vienna Cafe
supper. They had just got gaily to work on a
devilled bone when another medical contingent
sneaked in. Then more contingents arrived, all
with cold feet and a wild cry for a devilled bone.
The local medical fraternity has been extensively
dining its visiting brother-in-saw during the Con-
gress. Clever Surgeon Moore, who tops Collins-
street, gave a big dinner t’other night. Daven-
port, that most sporting of medicoes, gave a
20-guest-power man-dinner at the Athenaeum
Club of which filtered tales drift to envious
feminine ears.
The Carmichael Governor has been a frequent
and most welcome guest at many of these Man
dinners. His Governorship hath a soft and pretty
wit with his slow speech.
President Prof. Allen and Mrs. Allen gave a
be-a-utiful party at the University on Friday
evening, in honor of the visiting “ meds.” The
reception room was the wide, open stretch of the
grounds clothed in soft, mild moonlit night—the
paths and the trees and the lake made just visible
by thousands of soft-colored electrics. In this
mystical light quite a thousand well-dressed
women trailed pale silky draperies. The men
were sombre silhouettes. Gowns and hoods were
taboo, and in their conventional black and gleaming
white attire they looked like a herd of melodrama
villains. The dull black crush hat of every impor-
tant medico from far and near was collected there.
What became of the conglomerate patient this
last week it’s hard to say; but he probably died, or
got quite well. It was a great chance for those
patients who had been on a fair way to recovery.
They were left free from interruption. Guests
who had no soul for lighted gardens and grey,
ivy-clad walls, had a brilliant concert in the Wilson
Hall to fall back upon, and supper in the Conserv-
atorium. The Conservatorium Hall, once the
Museum and stony tomb of long-dead bones,
rejuvenated its grim self with a mile or so of pink
poppies, and an orchestra that lilted the latest
waltz.
Professor and Mrs. Allen received Everybody
on a scarlet carpet,under an awning just outside
Wilson Hall. There were a couple of thousand
or so of guests and the avenues were lit with an
unbroken line of acetylene motor eyes. The
Carmichael Lady, attended by her lord in black
and white, was a graceful presence in blue—
sapphire-blue cr6pe that had silver tissue to
mount it. The Wrixons were there, the
better half in purple. Big John Forrest brought
his lady, muffled in furs and wraps—all that ap-
peared to the naked eye was the top of her head
and a gay little wreath of silver leaves. There
are some beautiful women among our doctors’
wives. They were all at this party, in their most
fascinating frocks. The women doctors them-
selves are not too keen on worldly dress, but
Dr. Helen Sexton looked quite striking in a
classical cloak of dark blue covering a white dress.
At the concert, Conservatorium girls quartetted in
song and white gear. Miss Hesketh Jones
warbled, and Alberto' Zelman played divinely in
solo, and with ’Cellist Hattenbach. Hattenbach
mentioned incidentally that he is going to bring
his big fiddle to bear upon a Beethoven concerto
with Rita Hope, when that bright young pianiste
gives her show at the Town Hall next month.
The Congress of the medicoes has been respon-
sible for a furious outbreak of Garden Party.
Toorak caught the complaint in its direct form.
Unfortunately sleet and hail and rain assailed the
garden movement. I should like to record that
the Fraternity and its aggregate wife, being
authorities on hygienic clothing, attended these
wet functions in bathing suits, and took vigorous
exercise and a warm rub-down afterwards, but I
can’t. The authorities upon the exact way to live
wore the idiotic frockcoat and the plug-hat that
holds a quart of rain when it is turned the wrong
way up, just like uninformed mortals. And their
wives dragged soggy chiffons over the grass, and
exposed their pneumonia areas through trans-
parencies, and sat in damp, dainty shoes while
they ate the cold, cold trifle and the chilly ice-
cream. So one’s faith in the learned gentlemen
who have been discoursing so eloquently on up-to-
date health measures all this week is reduced to
the quantity that is less than nothing. Ah, me !
as the old-fashioned maiden raves in the novelette
wherein the beautiful young Countess de Slump is
imprisoned in a fortress by her cruel uncle.
Ada Crossley’s houses have been steadily grow-
ing. Her final vocal outpouring, on Thursday,
packed the Town Hall to the point at which there
was standing room only—and the organ loft over-
flowed with angelic, white-robed woman choir.
Throughout the season Miss Crossley has worn
such a series of wickedly fascinating frocks as one
could scarcely hope to see outside a ballet. One
of them was a pink as tender as a baby shell,
glowing into a luscious rose where the light darted
through its texture. A yellow sheath, with no-
thing to spare, had fantastic dragons climbing and
clambering all over the premises. One night the
lady was green from her shoe tip to the summit of an
osprey hat that shouted like sudden spring. Miss
Crossley has now gone east to the land where the
Big Trees grow, and where the soft air of the hills
turns every milkmaid’s voice into melody. The
Big Tree Land is the birth-place of the songstress,
and she has taken her wonderful frocks and her
wonderful smile and her voice and her husband to
stagger the natives and the woolly bears with
wonder.
Margaret Anglin leaves us at the end of the
month for Adelaide. She has two weeks’ engage-
ment there and four nights in Ballarat to follow.
On November 21st she is due again at Sydney
in “The Taming of the Shrew.” She stays
there a month, then she and sister Eileen leave by
the Mongolia. They propose to land at Port
Said and travel to Cairo for a fling before journey-
ing on to the Thames-side city. From December
the lady means to make one long vacation until
September of next year. Manager Nethersole
has booked her for the Hollis-street Theatre, at
Boston (U.S.A.), for that month. She is to
appear in “ The Awakening of Helena Ritchie.”
Clarence Weber’s Victorian Health and
Strength College is expanding into new and
larger rooms, with up-to-date fittings, that rejoice
the heart of the modern Hercules. The new
college had a double-barrelled opening ceremony
last week. There was a night for men and
another display—mildly tempered and more
clothed—to which ladies were invited. The
amazons of the classes were to have exhibited on
the ladies’ night, but when men appeared as
escorts, most of the muscular ones shivered into
modesty, and refused to “ expose,” as the French
say. Nevertheless, some muscular young men
in very thin clothes went through jiu-jitsu exer-
cises and marvellous feats of “ lifting,” and fired
the ambitions of soft and flabby ones among the
onlookers. Weber himself spent the time in
graceful flannels between a womanly Guild expo-
sition in the Masonic and his own classes.
As well as classes for mere male man, Weber
has a school for girls—adoring creatures who go
through their jiu-jitsu as rites before a shrine,
and are glad from their top hair-pin.down to their
boots when they discover the steadily increasing
suppleness and improvement of their figures.
A physical culture girl is adaptable to all the
new;-figure changes that fashion flings at cringing,
subservient women.
Poor old Herbert Flemming is dead. Flem-
ming, despite his ill health, was always cheerful.
“Just wait till sunshiny weather comes again and
I’ll be tip-top,” were his hopeful words. Sun-
shine’s been late in coming this year, and the
good soul went under, hopeful to the last. On
more than one occasion he had been on the point
of dying in his dressing-room, within ten minutes
of the curtain rising on a comedy in which he
presently went on and played his part.
Percy Grainger has again distinguished himself
—this time his feet are the performing members.
Last visit he walked some incredible distance jn
Maoriland within some remarkable period. This
time he has been doing the same sort of business in
Victoria. From Yarram to Sale, a 46-miles step, in
11J hours, is an allegro furioso performance. And he
finished allegro risoluto over loose sandy soil to a
capital audience of cyclists and hoof-padders.
If any man says the distinguished player is handi-
capped with, his name of Percy and his golden
hair—well, that man hath sought an invention.
Which is the Biblical manner of intimating that
he has been bowled out.
Mr. Roderick Murchison, that most amiable
and hospitable squire o’ dames, came back by
the China from far places. He was welcomed ’
with heartfelt joy by any number of widows and
confirmed spinsters and nursery belles. The
vivacious old gentleman makes a hobby of being
a dear to nice youngsters, and a perfectly sweet
person to the relict who is charming but lonely,
and the maid who isn’t as young as her prettiest
sister.
Mrs. Janet Clarke is commencing to feel some-
what perkier. After all her trials of the flesh,
she is sufficiently recovered to be chaired and
carried to a sun-warmed balcony from which she
can look at the world for an hour or so. She is a
changed Dowager these days. The jetty hair shows
touches of white, and the clever, energetic face is
a grey mask in which the black eyes look three
sizes too large. But the lady’s pluck and cheer-
fulness have never failed, and she means to be on
deck again before Christmas, and probably she’ll
arrive there looking as handsome as ever. Courage
can work wonders.
A farewelling tea was given in The Chicago to
Mrs. Fred Danby, a most popular dame with a
Voice, who goes to try her luck in the West. The
pleasant Henry Butler, as spokesman for her
friends, presented the departing one with a purse
that held close on a hundred golden guineas.
From “Rosna,” in Adelaide
Our Exes, went moting to Mount Gambier last week,
and spent a few days with the Clarkes, of Mount
Schank. The Mayor and corporation, and the local
slice of our leaning army, and all the celebrities the
town could show, met them, and sang anthems at
them, and they even survived the excitements of the
Mount Gambier Show. It was a sort of a farewell visit,
and, before they left, the viceregals ran up the Mount,
shook it kindly by the crater, and said they were
pleased to have met a real volcano, even though it was
moderately *dead. The town presented his tall Ex. with
an address. He’ll be able to paper his ancestral castle
with the addresses that have been thrust at him.
The Bony Personage with the Scythe was busy in
Adelaide last week. There passed out V. L. Solomon, the
jolly member for the Northern Territory; architect
Bayer, of Glenelg; and Mrs. Charlie Hamilton, wife of
the medico, a charming woman who could be ill-spared.
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
is having a busy time over the tramway business, and
Mrs. Ennis roams the landscape daily, keeping hours that
amount to cruelty to woman. While the electric lines
are being planted the old horse ruins run on single lines,
and the consequent overcrowding is enough to make a
horse’s mother weep for her child. Mrs. Ennis lately
spent one whole day on the kerb in front of the City
Baths, that being the place where the poor, rackety
steeds come in for most maltreatment; and she has her
inspectors stationed all over the place. She has even
succeeded in persuading a throng of North Adelaide folk
not to use the horse cars, but to walk back and forth
until the new vehicles are ready.
The Kindergarten movement grow T s apace, and the
latest report shows that every day more infants than can
be accommodated are clamoring for admission and pound-
ing with their feeding-bottles on the door. There are
three free kindergartens with 150 kiddies, and 17 nice
girls are being trained for the work by the young
principal, Miss de Lissa. Mrs. Percy Morice, wife of the
Parliamentary Librarian, is the energetic secretary and
prime mover, and anyone who is bowed down with
shekels is advised to communicate with her.
The marriage of the Charles Angas’ daughter Beryl
and ex-aide Captain Ryder occurred at St. George’s,
Hanover Square, Fogville, last month, the deed being
done by Bishop Harmer, erstwhile of this See. The
bride wore white, satin brocade and had six brides-
maidens and two train-bearers. The benedict has a
brother who is a journeyman earl : he kindly vacated
one of the ancestral castles so that the pair might honey-
moon therein. Also, there are about eight titled sisters
in the family. The Tennyson twain were among those
present.
Adelaide folk, gazing on the sweet countenance of
Olive Godwin at the Royal, can’t cease to marvel. When
she was here last year, and the appendicitis fiend had her
down and was sitting like a big oak bookcase on her
chest, nobody thought she’d ever charm the multi-
tude again. The authorities reckoned hers was the
largest case of appendicitis they had ever struck, and her
recovery is considered something out of the common dog-
trot of events.
Muriel Matters, the Adelaide elocution girl, who went
seeking laurels in Bullopolis a few years ago, has turned
suffragette. She spends her days addressing indoor and
outdoor meetings, chalking pavements, and in other
equally in tehee tua l pursuits, but whether she has reached
the altitude of being gaoled yet we do not know.
Yours affectionately,
J OHANNA.

CONTINENTAL SQUARE TREADS.
The new Continental Square Tread Model de Course Motor Tyre is the
heaviest and strongest pneumatic tyre in the world to-day. It is so
designed that the rubber thickness reaches its maximum strength where
strength is most needed, viz., on the tread. The wear and tear falls
precisely on that part of the tyre best able to stand rough usage. The
defensive powers ” of the tyre have been massed in just that position
where the road attack is severest.
CONTINENTAL ANTI-SKID LEATHER TREADS.
The new Anti-Skid Leather Tread Continental Motor Tyres have been
specially designed to meet the requirements of stony road and wet weather
conditions. The leather is cured to the rubber by a secret steam process—not
a chemical process as is usually employed—and it is impossible for the leather
to cause any trouble by lifting. This new type of Anti-skid Continentals
reaches the highest point ever attempted in non-skid devices. Motorists
who have tried and tested the new tyre are loud in their praises of it.

RHEUMATISM.
Cubed by Dk. Williams’ Pink Pills, and the
Proof is Hebe.
Nothing better demonstrates that rheumatism
is a disease of the blood than the fact that it is
hereditary in certain families. It may not develop
until conditions of cold and dampness favor it, be-
cause Nature is always fighting to keep the body
in health. When disease does get the upper hand
the rheumatism is seated in the blood. A remedy
that will revitalise and renew the blood is the
simplest and best means of relief.
A remarkable instance of the value of Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills in this disease is shown by
the cure they effected in the case of Mr. James
Walker Peacock, St. John Street, Pyrmont,
Sydney.
“I had rheumatism off and on for about two
years,” he said. “I was attacked from the neck
to both hips, across the shoulders and down the
arms. Every now and then I’d have to knock off
work and lay up at home. At times I could
hardly move in bed; at other times I could not turn
my head nor move my arms. It was a great
trouble for me to lace my boots; bending at all
gave me a great pain. 1 was rubbed with turpen-
tine and various liniments, but I only got ease for
a time. Every rubbing made the parts so tender
that I could not bear anyone to come near me.
The least movement and I suffered fearfully. I
could only walk very slowly, and very often I was
so stiff that it was all I could do to drag myself
along. I never knew when an attack was going
to take me. Perhaps I’d go to bed all right and
wake up in the morning practically unable to
move. I’d be like this for days before I’d get a
little ease. I might get a sudden bout when work-
ing and have to come home and take to my bed.
My mates can tell you how I couldn’t get my coat
on with the pain ; I had to get one of them to just
throw it across my shoulders. Often the pain was
so fierce that it took me all my time to keep from
singing out with it I went off my food com-
pletely and lost weight fast. I went to a doctor
and took his medicines, but I can’t say that I got
much better. A friend of mine in New Zealand
told me to give Ur. Williams’ Pink Pills a trial.
I did. and it was marvellous the way they cured
me, and they cured me for good, too, for I have
never had a return of the rheumatism since. My
health in general is excellent.”
A Warning.
It’s important to note that Mr. Peacock was
cured by the genuine Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills,
not by something that the shopman says is
“ just as good.” We’ve never heard of a “ just as
g»od ” imitation curing anyone, so insist on get-
ting Dr. Williams’. They are sold by most
chemists and storekeepers, or if not locally obtain-
able will be sent direct by the Dr. Williams’

POLITICAL
POINTS
Two Queensland Ministers, anyhow—
Peter Airey and George Kerr—have fired their
portfolios back at State Premier Kidston, and
refused to touch any Philp coalition - with a long
pole. And there is still hope that some more
may follow their good example shortly.
With the minting of its own silver and
copper coins, Australia will come into some pro-
fits which it should have enjov’ed long ago.
According to official estimates, 'the profit on
£1,000,000 worth of minted silver, after replacing
worn coins, is about £440,000. The profits on
£lOOO worth of copper coin is, roughly, £5OO, with
copper at £6O per
ton. The total
currency will re-
turn about £36,000
per year.
THE YASSURER A CAPITAL.
Colonel Ryrie (who represents the district in the N.S.W.
Assembly and lives in it) savs that the land between Can-
berra and the coast is so poor that “it would not materi-
ally matter how much of the country we give to the Com-
monwealth.”
“You can have it, you know. It's no earthly
good to us, but it's good enough for Australia."
Up in Queensland, where the Tory and
black-labor crowd says the white man can’t work
owing to the excessive heat, the cane crop lias
been badly damaged by frost. There seems to be
a discrepancy somewhere.
Melbourne Age is in a painful position
with regard to Victorian politics. The paper is
done with Bent, and is writing him down daily, but
apparently it has no one to put in his place, and
certainly it has no party to fill the Ministerial
benches. Prendergast is there, of course ; but the
Age hasn’t yet brought itself to take on a Labor
party with Prendergast as Premier. At the two
recent by-elections it therefore couldn’t barrack
for anybody, because the candidates that weren’t
branded Bent were branded Labor. What the
Age is going to do about it isn’t clear ; it is under-
stood to be praying hard for somebody to turn up
as a leader.
Sickness causes a loss of both time and
money. You lose the time and have the expense
of medical attendance, entailing’ a double loss.
This can be avoided by using some reliable remedy
at the first stage of the sickness. The purchase of
a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic, Cholera and
Diarrhoea Remedy often proves a profitable invest-
ment, for, by its use at the first appearance, any
unusual looseness of the bowels, a severe attack of
diarrhoea or dysentery may be averted, that might
otherwise compel a week’s cessation from labor.
Every household should have a bottle at hand. It
never fails and is pleasant to take. Get it to-day.
It may save a life.*
The velocity of the Victorian Lands
Department calls for a special speed
gauge. Lately—which, in the Depart-
ment’s system of reckoning, was two
years ago—a person residing at Moe ap-
plied for 1200 acres of land, paying at
the time £2O for survey fees. Subse-
quently he was informed that the neces-
sary papers would be ready in a month or
six weeks. He hasn’t heard anything
further since. Indeed the matter has
been so long receiving attention that he
has been wondering whether anything has
happened to the attention. Probably it
has. The last this paper heard of it was
in connection with an application from
Noah for a lease at Ararat. And then it
wasn’t any too fresh.
When Australian Governments
which harbor that expensive item of
curious haberdashery known as the Black
Rod found the public gorge rising at the
continued appointment of an Usher to
look after it, they took to disguising
the objectionable office by tacking on to it
other offices of some little real use. N.S. W.
was the first to play this game, and Black
Rod still lives and draws a spanking
salary there. Now the Australian Govern-
ment gazettes G. H. Monahan as Clerk of
Select Committees, Usher of the Black Rod, and
Secretary of the Joint House Committee, at a
salary of £475, thus sandwiching the condemned
ham between an upper and lower layer of apparent
bread.
The Parliamentary Committee that is in-
quiring into the question of Victorian Govern-
ment importations struck a suggestive fact the
other day. Premier Bent, when challenged as to
the excessive railway importations, had laid before
the House a return setting forth that the total
railway importations for 1906-7 amounted to
£8969. The Customs Department, however, in-
formed the investigating committee that the rail-
way importations for that year amounted to
£64,644 worth of dutiable goods, and £66,793 of free
goods, or a total of £131,437. As the committee
couldn’t for the life of it make £8969 and £131,437
tally, it pondered hard. Then it recollected that
Adolphus was Minister of Railways, and—well,
Victoria has begun to know its Adolphus.
Considering the futile way Britain sits
down and looks at its unemployed, the Commons
need not have been so uppish with the White-
chapel Hebrew who cast a bunch of papers from
the strangers’ gallery, and invited the members to
read his scheme for dealing with the problem.
The cable says that the Jew was “ejected and
admonished ” —presumably whilst his papers were
being removed with the smoking-room tongs
wielded by the Usher of the Murky Pole. In the
present chaotic condition of British legislation,
the Commons is not entitled to reject any sug-
gestion without exhaustive inquiry, and this reck-
less casting of Solomon out of the Temple may yet
prove a most expensive indignity.
Another of Adolphus Bent’s little land-
transactions has got something the matter with it,
and isn’t thriving. A while back he
bought the Maribyrnong Estate, osten-
sibly for closer settlement. But the
Closer Settlement Board declined it en-
thusiastically at the price Bent had
paid for it. Then Bent said he would
cut it up for workmen’s homes, but
that was as far as that project got. At
present the land is temporarily used for
grazing, but when the Bravbrook Coun-
cil asked the occupier for his rates, he
asserted that he was only a “ permissive
occupant” and knew nothing about
rates, and anyhow, as it was State
land, it wasn’t rateable. Now the
Council is worrying the Closer Settle-
ment Board, and is asking Bent what
he is going to do about it. And all
Bent can say is “ Dunno.” The number of things
he “dunno” now almost equals the number of
occupations he said he followed when he was
young.
Premier Bent’s new Yic. Land Valuation
Bill, in place of the one he recently withdrew
because the Country party barked, is
such a trifling- circumstance as to be
hardly worth noticing.' It merely
orders the municipalities to make a
valuation which shall set forth (a) the
nature of all improvements; (b) tiie
unimproved value of the land ; (c) the
improved value; and ( d ) such other
particulars as may be required. The
Minister of Public Works is to pay
half the cost, and if he doesn’t ap-
prove of the valuation, he may order a
fresh one ; or, if he fails to get satis-
faction then, the Governor in Council
may appoint valuers to do the job
honestly. Notwithstanding the new
valuations, the endowments to munici-
palities are not to be interfered with ;
and the most valuable feature of the
earlier Bill—the power given to the
Valuer-General to resume estates at
the owners’ valuations—is dropped
overboard altogether. But as that is
almost certain to be what will happen
to the whole Bill, the discussion is of
little consequence. In fact, nothing
that Bent does nowadays matters
much. His political working days are
done.
Herbert Parsons, about the ablest
of the younger members of the S. A.
Bar, who accompanied Premier Price
on his recent tour through England,
will probably run for the late “Vabe” Solo-
mon’s Northern Territory seat in the State
Assembly. His father was a former Govern-
ment Resident there, and also represented the
place in the Assembly. Parsons has money
through his relationship with millionaire Angas,
and he is a son-in-law of Advertiser Bonython ;
also he is a law-partner of Glynn, M.H.R., and
served his articles to Kingston.
STATE FRIGHTS LOGIC.
Dr. Cullen, in opening- the case, said it was laid down
in the Constitution Act that the Treasurer of the Com-
monwealth shall ascertain each month the balance of the
revenue over the expenditure, and shall pay that balance
to the States as surplus revenues.
Mr. Justice Isaacs said in this case Parliament had
voted £250,000 for the defence of the country, to be ex-
pended in not a remote future. It had not yet decided
on the form of the expenditure, but said it wanted the
money, and yet Dr. Cullen said that money was surplus
money.
Dr. Cullen: It is, until the money is expended.
—High Court, N.S. W.v. Commonwealth.
CHORNIC CADGER: “I tell yer, I claim every
cent in your pocket!”
BILL: “ Don’t be foolish, old man. It's mine,
and has to carry me through the coming year."
CHRONIC CADGER: “It's, yours? Well, I like
that! When you've got money it's mine, an’
it ain’t yours unless you've spent it!”
David Gaunson, the blusterous solicitor
who itries to cover his hopeless Toryism with a
glaze of Democratic sentiment, couldn’t even save
his deposit at the Carlton (Vic.) by-election. He
was there, seemingly, to split the Labor vote so
that the Bent candidate might get in, but the
Labor vote didn’t split worth a cent. 8,. H. Solly
won easily; the Bent.ite (who got 927 votes)
tagged along some distance behind; and David
Gaunson, with a miserable 82 supporters, was hull
down on the horizon, and his angry countenance
couldn’t even be descried with a telescope.
“ K.” writes ;
Labor-organiser Scullin, who denied (B. 8/10/’08) having
said that “the dairyman with a large family is a curse,”
has suffered simply from over-condensation. I happened
to be at the meeting where the alleged statement was
said to have been made. What Scullin stated was that
one of the worst evils of tenant-farming (which he
denounced) was the fact that it consisted largely in the
sweating of children. The farmer with the largest family
was able to offer the highest rent, so that that farmer was
(instead of the blessing he ought to be) really a curse. At
the same meeting Scullin hurled his righteous anathema
at those farmers (and his meeting was in the heart of the
leading dairying district of the Commonwealth) who
sent their young children into the milking-yard,
and so spoiled them physically and mentally.
Scullin courageously added that, though saying
these things might lose his party a few votes,
he intended to say them all over the Victorian Western
district. Of course, he was perfectly right. All over the
district named there are large families, either as tenants,
or on the share system, or simply on contract, which are
being sweated unmercifully by the rich landlords. And
it is an evil that is steadily growing, for though the
families are increasing in number, there is no increase in
the, area of cow-country. It is perfectly obvious that a
man with eight or ten strong sons and daughters can,
when the sons and daughters are willing to work simply
for their food and clothes, pay a lot higher rent than
the man who has to hire his labor. God knows, country
labor is cheap enough, but it is never so cheap as the son's
and daughters (especially the daughters) of the tenant-
farmer. So The Bulletin is hereby requested to restore
Scullin’s curse, and to print it in capital letters.
THE WOULD-BE POT BOILER.
AUSTRALIA: “ Say, Wade, old man, it's no good
you blowing up that fire. It'll never blaze
up enough to make the pot boil.”
“I’ll follow the Bent Government to the
bitter end,” said David Gaunson. in support of
his candidature at Carlton (Vic.) the other night.
“ Take the first mourning coach, Davy,” replied a
sepulchral voice from the chairs.
Ihe good dictum of Australian High
Court Justice Barton, when giving judgment in
the Surplus Revenue cases, the other day :
The Commonwealth is not the mere agent of the States
to handle part of their revenue, and take a dole for its
work ; that is not any part of the purpose of a national
Government, especially one to which the Customs and
Excise have been assigned, with exclusive control as to
imposition, collection and management. As well might
we foster the assumption that exists in some quarters,
that the Commonwealth is an alien body, an invader in
Australia without rightful foothold on her soil, lacking
citizens to enjoy the national protection and defend the
national rights.
October 21 was busy day at Moree
(N.S.W.) lands office. Eight settlement leases
are available in the district; and no less than
1200 applications were lodged and £12,500 fees
deposited before the office closed. The winning
marbles will be drawn as soon as the details can be
arranged. Meanwhile Wade’s Bill to put down
sweeps is getting along nicely, and the daily
papers are still satisfied that the demand for land
is being quite well supplied without resorting to a
graduated land-tax.
P.M.-G. Mauger has been quietly carrying
out reforms in the Post Office, while the Postal
Commission was busily trying to recommend
them, wherefore that body is aggrieved. In cor-
respondence with the Prime Minister, it is said to
be complaining that Mr. Mauger deals with
evils which ought to be left untouched until it has
delivered its formal curse upon them. Obviously
its fear is that Mauger will anticipate it to such
an extent that its beautifully-drawn-up report,
in about 4708 folios and a morass of language,
will miss the ’bus or the four-wheeler or the
Cobb’s vehicle, or something.
MAORILAND ELECTIONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Whip up the votes ! The battle day is here,
The General Election draweth near,
The air is shrill with candidates and beer.
J. Ward is curled and oiled to meet his fate ;
Large of moustache, and of a sprightly gait,
He putteth on his blandest smile of state.
The Massey pipeth in the wilderness
Of settlers’ wrongs, loud howling for redress,
And Tory watchwords of deep cussedness.
The leagues of Anti-Bung are on the trail,
The hosts of stricken Beer make doleful wail,
The air of battle has grown very stale.
Wild hair and whiskers waggle on the stump,
But no one really seems to care a dump
Who gets the job to mend the parish pump.
Here is no issue worth a tinker’s curse,
Save who can best protect the public purse.
Ward’s pretty bad ; the others might be worse.
A mighty lot of things need badly doing,
A mighty lot of nasty things are brewing ;
But who’s got time while borrowed cheques we’re blewing ?
Here ends the lay ; and will you please observe,
If politicians have less sense than nerve,
We’re getting just about what we deserve.

THE WEAKEST LINKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
il.liout much searching, it is easy to recognise in the
eltort.s to belittle State Governorships and urge their
abolition a set determination to promote the detachment
ot Australia from the Empire.—Argus.
You’ll kindly note the lesson clear :
The links that keep the Empire whole,
And cause Australia to adhere
To Mother England, are the queer
Old gents who come here, spic and span,
To posture at so much per an.
They may he dull—they often are ;
They may he weak —it happens so ;
But if we banish them ’twill mar
The mightiest Empire known, and jar
It all to bits, the Argus thinks
(Lor’ save it if these he the links !).
The proposition’s fairly plain.
I know it true. You’ll please observe :
The strength of any rope or chain,
As gifted experts will explain,
The strength is of its weakest strands—
And so the Argus understands.

WORMS IN CHILDREN.
A Veky Prevalent Complaint.
In very young children much of the irritation
and fretfulness is often due to the presence of
worms. Restlessness, fitfulness, sudden starts and
wetting the bed during sleep, hardness and ful-
ness of the belly, irregular movements of the
bowels, excessive secretions of saliva from the
mouth, are invariably indications of the irritation
caused by worms.
In older children the same symptoms are pres-
ent, but more distinctly defined. Grinding of the
teeth, violent movements of the legs and arms,
and undue flow of saliva, which causes frequent

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The last race of the last day at the recent Caul-
field meeting- has been pointed to as proof of the neces-
sity for an amendment of the starting-gate system. Here
was a case in which the field should have been recalled
for another start, as in the days when the flag was in
vogue. Some of the horses were practically out of the
hunt the instant the others got going, but because the
gate had been raised at the starter’s command, and the
gate is officially supposed to be fair beyond question, the
victims of this ragged dispatch couldn’t hope for the ad-
vantaged horses to be called back. Some of the starts
nowadays are worse than the worst that ever happened
when the man with the flag bore all the responsibility for
his mistakes. The fact that the best and the medium
ones are better than they were of yore is no satisfaction
to the owners and backers of horses which somehow get
left when the machine rises. These cases of palpable in-
justice couldn’t occur if a steward with a big bell were
stationed on a perch 20yds. above the starting post, with
instructions to ring a very ragged field back to line. The
quick beginners will always sprint away in front, but the
others should get going on fairly level terms.
The Victoria Derby, which has been the
public trial of several Melbourne Cup winners and placed
horses, is this year regarded as a match between Parsee
and Alawa. There are others—notably Monobel, Tiercel,
Baw Bee, Lord Nolan, and Mother Goose—that might run
much better than is expected in the Derby and start at
a short price for the big handicap next Tuesday. Thus
far Parsee looks a very good thing for the Blue Ribbon,
for he beat Monobel and others easily enough in the
A.J.O. Derby, and cut down Alawa in the Caulfield
Guineas. The latter proved himself a smart three-
year-old by subsequently winning the Eclipse
Stakes (11 furlongs), which performance suggests
that the thick-set son of Malster is a stayer,
likely to make a bold bid for the Cup. But
just as much, or more, may he said for Parsee on the
strength of his brilliant victory at Randwick, nor is there
any visible reason why Baw Bee, Monobel and Mother
Goose should not also be equal to a two-miles journey.
As to whether the best of the three-year-olds can beat
the best of the older Cup horses on w.f.a. terms or there-
abouts, there has been very little comparative “ form ” to
swear by. The position is this : The merits of Parsee and
Alawa have not been fairly tested by the older horses
that are now backed at short prices for the Cup. On the
other hand, Monobel, Baw Bee, Mother Goose and
co. have been made to look small potatoes by
Mooltan, Peru and Maranui. Therefore, if Parsee
and Alawa aforesaid run first and second for the
Derby next Saturday, the other three-year-olds will look
smaller potatoes than ever, whereas if one or more of
them perform brilliantly in a fast-run Derby— i.e. , beat
Alawa and stretch the neck of Parsee —the performance
will indicate improved “ form ” and a chance in the Mel-
bourne Cup. The writer takes Baw Bee and Monobel to
be of the improving- kind, and reckons that either of
them is worth backing at very long odds for the Double
event —Derby and Cup. All the same, the Derby tip is
Parsee 1, Baw Bee 2, Monobel 3, Alawa 4. The colt that
won the classic event at Randwick should do likewise at
Flemington, but this is not to say he is worth backing at
short odds for the Double. The chances are against any
three-year-old winning the Cup this year.
How often do the youngsters have the better of
the veterans in the two-mile handicap ? Last year Moun-
tain King, the Derby winner, finished third for the Cup.
In the previous year, to be sure, Poseidon and Antonious
ran first and second for both events. But we have to go
back to 1904 to find a Derby horse (Blinker) placed in the
Cup, and back to 1902 for the ease of Abundance, who
won the Derby and was third in the Cup. In 1900 the
Derby winner, Malster, ran second for the Cup, beaten by
another three-year-old, Clean Sweep. In 1899 the
double was won by Merriwee ; in ’97 Auruna was
placed in both events; in ’96 Newhaven won the
double; in ’95 Auraria won the Cup after being
placed third in the Derby, and in ’93 Carnage ran second
for the Cup after winning the blue ribbon. It seems,
then, that one of the Derby horses gets placed for the
Cup, as a rule. That one is usually the winner of the
classic piece of haberdasher}'. Sometimes two of the
Derby horses get placed again on the following Tuesday,
but these times are rare. And sometimes the best
juveniles are not good enough to get a look in at the
finish of the Cup.
The writer presumes that Mooltan, all going
well with him meanwhile, will win the Melbourne Stakes
next Saturday, and finish first or second for the Cup. The
others to be considered are Peru, Tulkeroo, Destinist,
Dyed Garments, Post Town, Welcome Trist, Maranui, Sir
Aymer, Delaware, and the two that run foremost in the
Derby. Dyed Garments is bound to run respectably in
any two-mile race, but he has never before been handi-
capped as high as Bst. 91b. in first-class company, nor has
he ever been as elderly as now. These things may tend
to make him Dead Garments. The Sydney Cup winner
may be considered somewhat out of it this time. He is
overweighted, like Destinist. Sir Aymer is fancied, firstly
because he represents Earnshaw’s stable, and secondly
because he split Mooltan and Maranui in a vv.f.a. race
over 12 furlongs. The “ form ” is impressive only on
paper, for Mooltan won as he liked, and some of the
others were not galloping for their lives. Sir Aymer ran
badly in the Caulfield Stakes, his staying power is
doubtful, and it is only his light weight that
recommends him. Should he make a bold bid in
the Melbourne Stakes next Saturday he will be
a strong fancy for the Cup, but in the 'meantime there
are a number of “ ifs ” in his case. Post Town and
Delaware are possibilities rather than probabilities.
Welcome Trist has run one good race this season, when
he won the Coongy Handicap from Wooroona, who
afterwards won the Moonee Valley Cup. Were the Trist
an approved stayer, the writer would fancy him a bit,
but his stamina is very doubtful, and Maranui should
beat him at the weights. Between Maranui, Peru and Tul-
keroo there is positively nothing to choose, assuming
that the Maorilander can go two miles. The other two
are unquestionably equal to the distance, for they fin-
ished first and second for last Australian Cup, with
only a length between them. The four-year-old Peru,
having improved considerably meanwhile on the w.f.a.
scale, has to allow the six-year-old Tulkeroo 91b.
for the beating he gave him last March. Lately
we have seen Peru run a moderate second to Mooltan in
the Metropolitan, and Tulkeroo run a closer second to
Maranui in the Caulfield Cup race. Each of them mcits
his recent conqueror on improved terms in the Melbourne
Cup. Youpay your money and you take your pick.
Seeing that Peru happened to meet and beat
Maranui in the Metropolitan on worse terms than he will
meet him on next Tuesday, the writer prefers Peru to
Tulkeroo, who was beaten by Maranui at Caulfield. And
he prefers Mooltan to Peru, notwithstanding the
burden of 9st. 121 b., which will lie heavy on the con-
science of that consistent performer when he comes to
the last furlong of the Cup journey. Perhaps he is not
“ a glutton for a distance,” as the hard-faced gentry would
put it. For that matter, Carbine w T as not a glutton, in
the full sense of the term. Mooltan, on paper, comes
nearer to the all-round excellence of Carbine than Poseidon
did. Last year, with a light weight up, he ran Melodrama
to a head for the Epsom mile in lmin. 38$sec. Then, with
a lighter weight, he beat Apologue half a head for the
Metropolitan—Apologue giving him 221 b. In the Mel-
bourne Cup, a month later, it was Mooltan who gave
Apologue weight—2lb.—and ran him pretty close. The
extra weight and extra distance made little or no differ-
ence to him last year. His performances at Eandwick
this month were brilliant, his heavy weight for the Cup
will be only 101 b. more than he carried when he
beat Peru and Maranui (who will also have to
put up some extra pounds), and all the time
he is said to be improving with every gallop.
Among the horses from four years old and upwards,
this honest son of Positano and Dilisk stands in a class by
himself. He looks equal to giving all the required
poundage to Peru and Maranui. He is seriously
threatened by nothing save the possibility that Sir
Aymer is a good stayer, in which cage a difference of 2J
stone in his favor should enable the English horse to beat
the top weight. There is, of course, the other possibility
of a clinking three-year-old .or two coming forth to
battle. But The Bulletin, going to press a week before
the Cup is run, is all in the dark re the question of clink
or no clink in the Derby field, therefore this prediction
reserves the right of changing the name of Parsee for
something else, if something else happens to win the
Derby. Here followeth the prediction
1. Mooltan.
2. Peru.
3. Parsee.
4. Maranui,
with Baw Bee as the best of the 50 to one chances.
If the youngsters that ran behind Zilka in the
Breeders’ Plate at Randwiek were a fairly good lot, the
Maribyrnong Plate also should go to that speedy filly.

William Day, probably the oldest of English
turf identities, died last month. The son of a horse-
trainer, he started life as a jockey, riding the winner of
the Ascot Gold Cup some 70 years ago. As a trainer he
must have had more than 40 years’active experience, and
in the “plunging” times, when his father and brother
trained a long string of gees at Danebury, wily William
carried on a friendly rivalry with them at Woodgates. It
sometimes happened that the two stables provided all the
entrants for a race at a small, tony meeting in their
neighborhood. Whilst the guileless public made a market
on the event by backing all the nags “ right out ” with
the “list” bookmakers in London (who at that time
plied their trade openly in Farringdon-street), the Days
W’ould choose a winner out of, say, two intended
starters, and having backed the dead sure thing
through their commissioner, would scratch all the others.
But these family arrangements were only minor considera-
tions in William Day’s business. He had a special talent for
bringing off big handicap coups with “dark” horses.
Mystery was a passion with him. Still he managed after
a time to lose ground in the training business, despite his
cleverness. For some years he did nothing of conse-
quence, but in 1881 he scored a great double event, the
Caesarewitch and Cambridgeshire, with Foxhall, for the
American ovyner, J. R. Keene; and the trainer won
enough money to confirm him in his resolve to retire
from business. William Day at that time was a very old-
looking little man of 59, but he lived to be 85. Soon
after his retirement he published his first book—“ The
Racehorse in Training,” and in 1886 he brought out his
“ Reminiscences of the Turf,” a book of anecdote and
gossip which promises to live as a classic in sporting
literature, and whereof another edition will probably be
published on the strength of the old man’s death.
With idyllic weather and firm wickets, Mel-
bourne Pennant cricket furnished some almost interest-
ing displays on Saturday last. Melbourne’s struggle with
Northcote was less than heroic, the former winning
easily by an innings and 39. Although the wicket was a
piece of perfection, Armstrong and Hazlitt, bowling un-
changed throughout the afternoon, took all the ginger
out of Northcote’s defence, that team’s total compilation
being only 96. P’ran, which defeated the almost invincible
East on the first innings, might have very easily made it a
straight-out win. East, which closed i ts second in nings with
five for 143, left P’ran with 110 to win, but, mainly owing
to the languid batting of Healy, the P’ran total stopped
at 6 p.m. with 103 for five wickets—eight short of victorjL
The end of the discussion between South and Richmond
supplied frantic excitement for an audience of about four
men and a dog. South, requiring 214 to win, looked as
if it had victory assured with three wickets to
spare, but Richmond bowler Kelly confiscated the
last three sticks practically for nothing, and
Skinner’s suburb lost by three runs, Carlton’s
victory over Fitzroy was notable for the first-
named’s unpromising commencement. Requiring 179 to
win, it at one stage of the game stood at only 36 for five
wickets, but some fine, vigorous batting by Warne (65),
Delves (31) and Fontaine (44) pulled the match out of the
conflagration. Carlton won by nine runs on the first
innings. University’s eclipse of Essendon by an innings
and 28 was scarcely in the nature of a surprise. The
students, who had one down for 95 on the previous Satur-
day, increased their score to 219 for four wickets,
declared their innings closed, and dismissed the ’Dons on
their second attempt for 116. As for the duel between
St. Kilda and North Melbourne, it was settled in favor of
the latter by a margin of two wickets and 16 runs on the
first innings.
Either there are some amazing batsmen
operating- in Sydney second-grade cricket, or the bowling
in the lower division is unusually defective. Consider
some of the scores on Saturday : Chapman, of Mosman,
101 ; Carroll and Langley, of Newtown, 104 and 135, both
not out ; Beveridge, of Randwick, 158 ; Smith, of Glebe,
200 ; Janes, of Balmain, 106. Six century-makers on the
job on one afternoon.
* * * *
The first-graders, the same afternoon, failed to
produce one century among them, although one of them
got aggravatingly close when A. Loudon, of Redfern,
smacked up 97 before Sullivan got him out l.b.w. After
Loudon the next best was the 87 not out of Pite, of
Sydney, and 78 by Richardson, of the same club. Satur-
day was the second consecutive occasion when Pite, the
chronic not-out, carried his bat. The previous Saturday
he shouldered his timber for 118 against Middle Harbor.
Evidently this is the season of the colts.

S.A. and Victoria have been playing a big
“ correspondence ” chess match, which is a weary affair
stretching out over long months ; indeed, the closure had
to be applied at last, and fully a quarter of the games
arbitrated on. The chief interest of the match was its
great size—32 a side—and the fact that S.A. won by 36£
to 27£. McArthur, for S.A., won both games from Grant
at the top board, Belcher tying with Gundersen at the
second.

“ Smell ”.- I rise to say a word on behalf of a
downtrodden and much-abused cult. I refer to the paid
motor-driver. Is it our fault that silly old ladies crossing
the road will sprint wildly back when within two feet of
the pavement and get into the centre of the road right
in front of the car as soon as they hear the horn tooting?
Can it be honestly said that the driver is to blame when
young ladies stop in the middle of the street until they
see on which side he is going to pass them, and then
trustingly run in the same direction. Yet for these
things we are blamed. And how we are reviled ! I, my-
self, the most careful of drivers, have been hailed as
“ road hog,” “ body snatcher,” and when I was addressed
as “ dog-squash ” I thought I had struck the bed-rock of
opprobrium. But I hadn’t, for in Brisbane, when the near
presence of the Law compelled me to crawl along at six
miles an hour, a dirty-faced, misbegotten brat, who ought
to have been at school, in gaol, or out of the world, drove
a dilapidated goat, attached to a box on wheels,
alongside, and addressed me. “ Hulloa, travellin’
stinker!” he yelled, coarsely; “I’ll race yer to the
Valley fora tray.” Really,. I am surprised so few children
get hurt—l mean murdered.

Owing to a smash-up at Bathurst (N.S.W.)
sports, the crack wheeler, George Horder, also F. Hagney
and Maorilander J. Summers are on the shelf for repairs.
Horder has accumulated much gravel rash, Hagney has a
broken collarbone, and Summers carries three fractured
ribs. The crack cyclists are a dwindling band.

At Hawthorn (Vic.), last Friday, ex-cyclist C.
St. Vincent, who is apparently possessed of more leisure
than “ savvy,” attacked the world’s skipping record for
1000 skips, and having got the beast by the wool or the
ear or something, knocked 4secs. off it—smin. 13secs.
The previous best, of smin. 17secs., was held by F. Con-
nor, of America, which address this paper admits is
vague but is sufficient for the importance of the subject.
Now that Australia holds the records for club-swinging,
piano-punching and skipping, it is about up to some
weak-minded but strong-limbed person to assault those
for thumb-twiddling', standing on one leg, and so forth.
And when the records for these strenuous exercises have
been caught, some still more deliberate individual can
have a shot at the record for leaning against a post.

Things will get exciting when the road hog of
this generation takes to air-motoring. It was cabled, the
other day, that the occupants of the collapsing balloon,
when the Gordon Bennett race started in Berlin, “cut
away 32 bags of ballast from a height of 4000 ft.” “ The
incident,” it was added, “shows how safe ballooning
really is.” Safe? Rather ! A mere bag of ballast,
dropped from a paltry 4000 ft., wouldn’t hurt anybody—
so long as anybody didn’t happen to be underneath it.”

For the first time since the season opened
Sydney sailing men, on Saturday, got the breeze they
love. It blew delightfully from the N.E. and the
amphibians revelled in it. It was the first yacht race of
the season and the craft flew the Sydney Yacht Squadron’s
burgee. The Thelma, a yacht designed by Sydney naval
architect iWalter Reeks far back in 1889, suddenly re-
appeared under control of G. Lloyd-Jones, and downed
all the later comers, including the fast-running Awanui
and the cloud-raking Rawhiti. The Thelma started on
six minutes’ handicap, Rawhiti on three, and Awanui
was, of course, on scratch. Awanui, rushing through the
water, finished first, leading Rawhiti by 3min. 22sec.,
which was ahead of Thelma by lmin. 41sec. But the
adjustment of the handicap made Thelma winner by 57sec.
In the open-boat section, things were exciting,
and Sydney Flying Squadron’s two heats and a final were
full of incident. Ben-my-cree went under at Shark
Island, andMaritana turned over at Point Piper. In the
first heat, Arthur was streaking along in great style when
a sudden earry-away brought it to a standstill, and Scot
rushed to the front and stayed there till the finish, with
Eileen and Oweenee in pursuit. In the second heat,
Pheasant got to the front from the jump, and continued,
with Donnelly and Evelyn behind at the winning line.
The final provided a great finish. Pheasant, which was
leading, crowded on extras to get away from Scot, which
was coming up very fast. But the effort was futile. Scot
again scooted to the van, and relegated Pheasant to
second place. Evelyn was third. Six other clubs held
races that were more or less exciting.

Apparently swimmer Beaurepaire knows how
to look after himself, even if it entails being unpleasant.
Which is a good thing. It seems that the Glasgow gentle-
man who was looking after Bogey’s Scottish engagements
had arranged to match him with Taylor, the English and
Olympic champion paddler, over 440yds. at the annual
gala of St. Bernard’s Swimming Club, Edinburgh. But
when Bogey arrived at the city of the Tolbooth he
declined to enter the water with Taylor. He offered to
streak over the distance against Taylor’s time, but swim
with Taylor he would not. Beaurepaire’s reason was
that, in a previous event,'; a half-mile struggle which he
won and in which Taylor was runner-up, the latter so
persistently bumped him that Beaurepaire vowed he
would never compete with him again, and, very properly,
he kept his word. If more athletes would take the same
stand it would do a lot to check the spread of Yankee
sporting tactics, which are becoming more or less general.

S.A. Football League has an annual medal for
the most brilliant and fairest player (the daily papers
added “and most gentlemanly,” but this is officially
denied). What would happen if the fairest player was
not brilliant, and the most brilliant player wasn’t fair,
seems doubtful. And then neither of them might be'
gentlemanly; they might both drink out of the finger
bowl. Anyway the medal has just been awarded—on the
vote of the umpires, who should be good judges—to
Tierney, who admittedly has all the good qualities, and
whose bald head has dominated the ruck of West
Adelaide (and incidentally of all the teams that “ West ”
has bumped up against).
The defeat of Joe Grim, iof Philadelphia, at
Sydney’ Gaiety last week by Arthur Cripps, the Australian
middleweight champion, confirmed the suspicion that the
“ Iron Man from Philadelphia ” is a pugilistic ignoramus.
His ignorance of fistic science is almost as.great as his
capacity to endure punishment, and that, is bey’ond all
precedent. If he only knew anything about even the first
principles of his trade he would be a world-smasher, con-
tinually’ confronted with the problem of where to bury
his dead. He swings blows that would make an ox totter,
but as they never by any chance get home, no one is any
the worse. One of them, delivered with judgment and
precision, would not only have ended the fight with Cripps
instanter, but haye sent his head whizzing'among: the audi-
ence. The defeat is not likely to injure Grim professionally.
Win or lose, he will be a profitable draw, for as a mounte-
bank and a clown he can give even George Reid many laps
start and beat him easily. He is a joke and a farce, but a
dangerous one. He rushes to the attack like a Free-
trade manufacturer rushing a Protective tariff, and if
only one of the cyclone of blows he delivers reaches a
vital spot, it is going to be a long good-night to the
other fellow. Curiously enough, if the other fellow
can anticipate the attack, Grim becomes moment-
arily helpless, and a straight left on the nose com-
pletely breaks up any idea of “ going mad.”
In the fight both men started cautiously enough.
Even Grim tried to be serious. Was he not up against a
champion? He received smashes and drives on the
mouth, the point, the neck, and bowed with courtly
foreign grace in acknowledgment; and then suddenly
clinching, walloped Cripps behind the ear right round his
neck. He showered blows down the back, and whacked
and beat the Australian all over the hinder part, from Han
to Beersheba. Cripps in his agony clawed wildly for a
grip of that destructive right, and when he got it he held
it tight. Towards the middle of the scrap Cripps dis-
covered that his best defence was to get in the first blow,
and he landed some beauties, which knocked the Yankee-
Italian’s head right back. But Grim never heeded them
—they seemed to produce no effect. Once Cripps smote
him a right hander on the mouth, crashed a straight left
on to the chin, and then bashed him heavily on the
top of the nose with the right—three knock-out
blows in quick succession. And still Grim was 6n his
feet, apparently unhurt. In the 17th round Grim began
to whirl his arms like flails ; in the 19th he went mad;
and in the 20th he was absolutely baresark. Cripps slung
boxing to the winds and unashamedly hung on to him,
embracing the Italian round the waist while a delighted
audience howled to him to kiss the Roman. But Cripps
hung on, and waited breathlessly for the gong to sound,
and all the while Grim jerked and bashed and struggled
to get free. With a desperate wrench he got loose, and
aimed three blows that would have burst open the gate
of a city, but they didn’t come within inches of Cripps.
Then the gong sounded. The referee pointed to Cripps.
Grim vaulted lightly over the ropes down among the
audience, and vanished without giving the hoped-for
speech.

When he arrived at Adelaide Johnson promptly
denied having “ opened his head ” on the subject of
Burns, and complained that the newspaper men were
trying to foster ill feeling between himself and his
opponent. If all the boasting and killing of Burns with
his mouth that has been attributed to Johnson is merely
newspaper invention, it is time some newspaper men
were in gaol; for the big black has been held up to scorn,
hatred, ridicule and contempt as a loud-mouthed
braggart. Writer met Johnson when he was in Australia
before, and certainly saw nothing of the boaster about
him. Quite the opposite, in fact, and when the reports
of the mouth butchery began to come through, most
people who had met Johnson wore a pained expression.
They had not expected it of him.
* ♦ * *
“J.”: A consideration of the Cripps-Grim
battle last week convinced me that those papers wrong
Grim who treat him as a pugilistic joke. Cripps is the
cleverest man at or near his weight that Australia owns.
Good judges opine that he would give T. Burns himself
something of a battle. Yet at no stage of the whirling
contest the other night was Cripps altogether at his ease.
There is danger in the Philadelphian’s very unconven-
tionality of attack. His oppone l i never knows what
sort of hit Grim is going to v"'gh in with next;
neither does Grim. If one of Grim’s wild lashes
connected unchecked with an adversary’s head it
would probably knock that portion of him into
the gallery and leave the rest to be counted out in
the ring. Cripps knew too much to undergo that experi-
ence in all its awfulness. But he endured some nasty
jars, nevertheless. Grim is extraordinarily clumsy in
all his movements, and in his battle with Cripps he was
made to appear even clumsier than he is, by contrast
with the other’s beautifully correct pugilism. But there
is method in Grim’s clumsiness ; a certain amount of it
is, not improbably, assumed. His footwork, which is by
no means bad, quite belies the weird arm-waving in which
he indulges. There is no question about Grim’s right to
the title of Iron Man. After about half-a-dozen
rounds, Cripps got quite tired of shooting wicked
body-blows into the Dago’s stomach and ribs,
(since the said blows produced no effect whatever),
and opened out on his opponent’s face and head. Grim
seemed to positively like it. After pokes in the jaw and
eye that would have acted like chloroform on a normal
human being, he smiled affectionately on Cripps and
clamored for more. For all the 20 rounds which the
contest went he skipped about, and thrashed the air and
Cripps’ head, neck, back and shoulders with flail-like
blows unceasingly, and yet when it was finished he
vaulted gaily over the ropes and cantered to his dressing-
room like a released two-year-old. Of course, he wasn’t
knocked out, or anywhere near it. No mortal fist will
achieve that feat in our time. It will require a six-
chambered revolver at close range.

Another foreign reputation that was uncomfort-
ably buried in an Australian grave on Monday night last was
that of Patrick O’Keefe, who drew a six-round scrap with
W. Papke, the man who broke up Stanley Ketchell, who
was to have killed Burns when he returned to the U.S.A.
E. Williams acted as sexton, and had a weary and painful
time of it at Melbourne Cyclorama, where the interment
took place. A feature of the contest was the rushing of
the building by the push, which declined to pay, and
swept in like a wave, carrying doors, ticket-takers and
police before it. O’Keefe received a lot of depressing
circumstances, which lasted 15 rounds. Then the police
interfered, and the referee gave Williams the verdict on
points. Williams’ ribs and midriff were much deteriorated
in the in-fighting, and he was about the most uncomfort-
able victor who has appeared in an Australian ring, but
O’Keefe’s walloping was none the less decisive.
A ORAY-FISH FANTASY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Great Mooltan was one of my fancies,
I also respected Peru,
And was fond—very fond—of the chances
Of Trist and the stout Tulkeroo.
But last night put an end to my doubting;
Past asleep on the sofa I fell,
And was wakened by somebody shouting
Monobel! Monobel! Monobel 1
Up to then I had talked of Sir Aymer,
Dyed Garments, Post Town and Parsee,
And had backed Alawa (he is gainer
Than old Delaware or Baw Bee);
By a man who is wise in his scheming
I’d been told Maranui looks well,
But now I am all the time dreaming
Monobel 1 Alonobel 1 Monobel!
Yes, it sounds like the name of a hallad,
But it stands for the name of an ’orse.
I had supped upon crayfish and salad,
And my mind, as a matter of course,
Was concerned with the Cup, when a babel
Of voices was rent by a yell
Which appeared to come “ straight from the stable ”
Monobel ! Monobel! Monobel!
Lord knows I am not an ascetic
In touch with the spirits of grace,
And never a vision prophetic
Has guided my pound on a race ;
Yet I, who have e’er been a scoffer
At Cup dreams, am bound by a spell
To accept what the bookies may offer,
Say, thirty-to-one Monobel 1

G. GILLICATT, Esq., of BILAMBIL
CREEK, TWEED RIVER, N.S.W. .writes
“My daughter lias been continually im-
proving regularly, although it was a very
severe case.”
REV. HENRY GAINPORD, ADELAIDE,
S.A., writes : —“The Earoscope Aural
Kinetics have wrought a marvellous change
in my hearing, and the distressing noises
have all ceased.”
MRS. ELIZA CJNCLES (68 years of age)
257 RILEY STREET, SURRY HILLS,
writes:—“The noises have all gone, and
my hearing is perfect now'. ”
The well-known REV. O. P. FOSTER
writes For the last 25 years I have been
paying heavy doctors’ bills, until they pro-
claimed my Deafness and Head-Noises in-
curable. I have now used the Pure
Natural Aural Kinetics of the Earoscope
for three weeks, and am delighted with it.”
J. A. lIODGKINSON, Esq., the well-
known Retired Foreman of the Govern-
ment Locomotive Works, PORT MEL-
BOURNE, VIC., writes :—“I am pleased
to inform you that my deafness is cured,
and the Head-Noises have disappeared.”

Pure Natural Aural Kinetics
Why remain Deaf, or suffer from Ear Troubles,
such as Head-Noises, Ringing in the Ears, Dis-
charging or Inflamed Ears, Nervous Headaches, or
any other complaints arising from the imperfection
of the Aural construction, which sooner or later
are sure to lead to Deafness !
Perhaps you have tried many treatments in vain,
or the doctors may have failed to do you any good.
This is no reason for you to give up in despair. No
case of Deafness or any other complication of the in-
ternal mechanism of the ear could be satisfactorily
cured with medical or electrical treatments. Probing,
syringing, or spraying in the ear (so much in vogue
amongst the old-fashioned treatments) only aggra-
vates the delicate nerves of the ear, and frequently
tends to make the trouble advance to a much more
severe stage. This is the reason why the “ EAROS-
COPE ” has created such a sensation in the scientific
world, as it contains no Drugs, no Chemicals, and no
Electricity, but simply Pure Natural Aural Kinetics,
which are applied by yourself right at your own
home, wherever you may reside.

Jim Currie, Queensland mail contractor,
horse-owner, bookmaker, and anything else that
happened along, has gone to his last settling.
Few men were better known in Western Queens-
land in the days of big cheques. He used to run
the mail between Longreach and Winton, but he
went for higher game afterwards. He owned the
horses Arthur, Delaware, Sailor Boy, Frolic, and
Residue. In his younger days he was a ped who
made money out of his heels. He and Billy Clarke
used to set traps for the tugs in the West. Currie
once struck a fencer’s camp on the Bulloo, where
there was a man who talked loudly about his
sprinting abilities. Currie gave him syds. in 100
for £5O a-side and annexed the stakes. On
another occasion Joe Julian, smarting at a defeat,
followed Currie out to Welford with a runner!
Julian was £2OO poorer when the race came off.
Currie entered for the first Sheffield at Longreach,
and was surprised to hear that he was placed on
the 15yds. mark. He bought himself in the Cal-
cutta, worth £lOO, and took all the money going
at 10 to 1. It was a great win for him. But when
he went to Melbourne he found there were others
there, so he went down slump by slump, and
finally an abscess on the brain finished a fight that
for a long while had been going seriously against
him.
The Sydney University chemistry profes-
sorship, vacated by Dr. Liversidge, has been
given by the Senate to Dr. Fawsitt, a lecturer in
Glasgow University. It was expected that the
choice billet would go, if not to an Australian
graduate, at any rate to a man from one of the
Australian Universities. But Sydney ’Varsity
Senate is keen on importations. It imports the
lesser lights for lectureships, and, no matter how
hard they may work, when the professorships are
vacant it imports afresh. This policy drives away
the ambitious younger men. Thus E. Kilburn
Scott, the electrical engineering expert imported
a little while back, is said to be getting ready to
quit. The Sydney ’Varsity Senate is too much
for him.

BLACK DESPAIR
RIDES AWAY
before Mother Seigel’s Syrup. You
know that despair—the depression
and despondency which come from
constant headache, pain after eat-
ing, sickness, nausea, sleeplessness
and dizziness. Such constant
troubles make life almost a curse to
sufferers. But Black Despair rides
away, and the shadow on your life
is lifted, by Mother Seigel’s Syrup.
It is a purely vegetable remedy
which acts directly on the stomach
and liver, and thus removes the
cause of all these troubles —Indiges-
tion —a disease which takes many
distressing forms, and is responsible
for nine-tenths of human misery.
It cured Mr. Driscoll (who now lives at
42, Mount Street, Pyrmont, N.SAV.) of
acute indigestion many years ago. Writing
on March 18 th, 1908, he says : “ I remain
absolutely free of my old troubles and can
eat, work, and sleep as well as any man. I
cannot be sufficiently grateful to Mother
Seigel’s Syrup for having restored to me
my lost heal tn.”

Private Enterprise can be a cheerful bri-
gand even when it doesn’t try. A while ago a man at
Etheridge (N.Q.) wanted a truck of maize. He bought it
at Atherton, and had it sent down on the Queensland
State line to Mareeba at 4s. per ton. There it had to be
put on to the Chillagoe Co.’s line. It went to Almaden
(the section over which the rates are fixed by Govern-
ment) for £2 ; total so far for 97 miles, £2 16s. But Pri-
vate Enterprise is still building the line on from Alma-
den, and as Private Enterprise affirmed that it doesn’t
have to adhere to the fixed rate (50 per cent, over Govern-
ment rates) until the line is completed, Private Enter-
prise calmly charged £l2 for the next 83 miles—£9 4s.
more for 14 miles less railage. Fortunately the man who
wanted the maize wears a limber leg with a large-sized
boot at the end of it, and he kicked so hard that Private
Enterprise was quite surprised, and hauled down the
rate from £l2 to £B, which is still over three times more
per mile than the State charges.
The Mari on the Land has a lot of time to think.
Last year Maoriland passed a law prohibiting the import-
ation of fruit which was not accompanied by a certificate
that fruit fly did not exist within a mile of the orchard
where the fruit was grown. Some of the Parramatta
orchardists succeeded in getting on the list of “ clean ”
orchards, and were able to ship fruit to M.L. at high
prices. But the N.S.W. Government Inspectors got
suspicious when they found that one grower was
exporting twice as much fruit as the inspector had seen
hanging on his trees. Then things were probed, and it
was found that the grower had been buying cheap fruit
from “ dirty ” orchards and selling it at high prices as
his own, on the strength of his Government certificate.
Not only was he plainly guilty of obtaining money under
false pretences, but he was exposing every orchardist in
Maoriland to fruit fly, and every one in N.S.W. to the risk
of having his produce wholly shut out by that angry
State. And the only punishment was the cancelling of
his certificate. People have “ done ” a long spell in a
carefully-enclosed place for much less.

The Australian —that useless fellow who can’t
make a clothes-peg—has been inventing again. Manager
Paddle, of the Ple.vstowe Sugar Mill, near Mackay (Q.),
has devised a sand-filter for dealing with sugar-cane
juice after it leaves the subsiders, the result of which is
said to be a reduced volume of molasses, less invert sugar,
and an improvement in vacuum pan work. The sugar
business, up to a certain point, has been shamefully abo-
riginal—the inevitable result of employing' cheap colored
labor—and the more improvements that come, the more
firmly will the industry be established as a white man’s
concern.

The “Old Soldier ” talks about wool in China :
—J. B. Suttor, the N.S.W. Commercial Agent, has got
hold of a yarn that the Chinese are going to clothe their
troops in woollen, and are putting up a mill between
Pekin and Kalgan, whence people start to cross the Gobi
Desert. “The necessary machinery has been ordered
from England, and may be expected to arrive in about a
month’s time.” When Younghusband was in Kalgan in
the late ’eighties, on his way to Yarkand, he found there
an active white agent collecting the wool of the two-
humped Bactrian camel for treatment in a mill in the
neighborhood. Welby, who crossed Tibet from Kashmir
to Pekin, was carried down the Hoang'-Ho in one of a
great fleet of wool-laden boats so numerous as sometimes
to cause serious blocks in the great river. Welby re-
peatedly remarks in hisaccount of his journey on the num-
ber of sheep always in sight on the “ Chang,” or table-
land of Northern Tibet. The expression, “sheep always in
sight” occurs constantly in his book. My own experience
on the N.W. frontier of India, 20 years before Welby’s
time, is that there was then a very large trade done by
the Tibetans across the border in coarse blankets and
woollen cloth of their own make. Make no mistake, John
Chinaman is not so simple as not to know all about wool
and woollen clothes when it suits him to savee, whatever
the guileless Commercial Agent may say.

The Socialist Co-operative Society of Victoria,
which runs a general store in Melbourne next door to where
Torn Mann used to clank the chains, seems to have gone
sailing in unexplored waters, and to have landed it doesn’t
quite know where. Its secretary being recently charged
with annexing 6s. 6d. and 25., the chairman of the special
committee appointed to overhaul the books explained
that the Society hadn’t launched the proceedings, but
was fully persuaded the discrepancies were merely clerical
errors. The Court was impressed, but reckoned it ought
to have a little more information. “ Well, sir,” said
the co-operator, “when we started the Society we
decided not to follow the usual lines. Consequently,
money would be handed over in the street, and
no receipts would be given. We thought we’d follow out
the Socialistic principles ; but the committee found it
impossible to trace many amounts through the books ; in
fact, it couldn’t feel absolutely sure about many small
amounts.” The P.M. agreed there was a good deal of
probability about the absence of sureness under such cir-
cumstances, and said that, as there was manifestly no
case against the secretary, he had better go and have
another try at straightening up his books. It says whole
volumes for the honesty of these Melbourne Communists
—not Socialists—that their store has been running about
two years and hasn’t “ gone bung ” yet. There are evi-
dently no importers in that society.

South Aus. has dredged up a new industry.
Recently a Parliamentary party went to Port Broughton,
on Spencer’s Gulf, and one of the speakers at the in-
evitable banquet produced some fine samples of fibre, and
spoke hopefully of turning it into an industry of consider-
able dimensions. The fibre is got from the sea near the
Port, and takes dye well. Experts have reported that
mercerised material of great value can be manufactured
from it; and another said he was getting ready to
use it for binder twine. Several well-gilded men of Ade-
laide are pushing the business along.
Suttor, N.S.W. Commercial Agent in “the
East,” is throwing up his hat because the Straits Settle-
ments imported £45,546 worth of Australian frozen meat
in 1907, an increase of £23,000 over 1906 ; and he is cheer-
ing on Australia to do better next year. But Australia is
beginning to have its doubts, and starts wondering
whether it wouldn’t pay it better to have chops at a
ha’penny or so cheaper for its own breakfast.

Behold, my dinner fields are waving green ;
These shall sustain my heart till I become

London , July 18, 1908.
Australian Pianos.
ONE of the many results of the Franco-British
Exhibition is to further impress us with the
enormous agricultural and mineral resources of
Australia, and incidentally with the present attainment
of her manufacturing industries. Although the pro-
ducts of the last-named are.not graphically represented
by exhibits, with the commendable exception of pianos
by Messrs. Beale & Co. and harvesting implements of
the Meadowbank Co., they total an annual output of
=£80,000,000 and give employment to 240,000 of the
still sparse population of the Commonwealth.
Prom official publications it will be seen that there
has been an enormous increase in the quantity and
variety of manufactured articles since the federation of
the States and the imposing of a Protective tariff. It
has been the aim of the Government to foster the manu-
facture in Australia of all that her people require, both
in necessities and luxuries, and doubtless the recent
increase of duties will prove a further stimulus to the
present manufacturers, and attract others.
The practicability of Englishmen is proverbial when
circumstances call out their best, and this could hardly
find a more striking exemplification than in the achieve-
ments of Messrs. Beale & Co., who have established a
successful piano manufactory in Sydney. They have
already produced upwards of 10,000 instruments, and
sold them through their own retail organisations.
Anyone wh.o knows the manifold difficulties to be
overcome in the making of a high-class instrument, will
readily appreciate the exceptional attainment of this
pioneer firm in what seems destined to become a great
industry at the Antipodes.
The fact that Messrs. Beale & Co. made and sold to
the public 1700 pianos last year proves that they have
found a large demand. This, as a natural sequence, is
largely the result of the satisfaction engendered by the
use of the thousands of Beale pianos previously sold
throughout the Commonwealth. Under new-world con-
ditions they have in fourteen years acquired a pro-
ficiency in construction which is usually considered
possible only after the accretion of decades of experi-
ence, tradition, and practical experimental development.
Previous to their becoming manufacturers to any
great extent they had sold at retail in Australia over
12,000 pianos of nearly all makes, and had become
thoroughly conversant with the characteristic qualities
of each. As none of the manufacturers of the world
had thought it worth while to patent their individual
improvements in Australia, despite the fact that there
was a large trade from there, this firm had an unre-
stricted field in adapting whatever there was of practi-
cal value to them. It is significant, however, that the
very heart of their instruments is their own original
creation. Indeed, they have been fortunate in invent-
ing and perfecting an iron and steel tuning system, of
which the iron wrest-plank forms an integral part of the
frame, which resembles an iron harp. By this means
they secure absolute rigidity, a greater length of string,
and higher tension—results impossible of attainment
under the prevailing system of employing a separate
wooden wrest-plank. This new' method affords an
opportunity for a slightly different disposition of the
stringing in laying out the scale, and secures a full,
round, brilliant tone, enriched by perceptibly increasing
the volume. Another invention is the patent hitch-
pins, which, by an original and ingenious method, are
cast in the frame itself, and are immovably attached
thereto.
In speaking of this Beale-Vader patent, the firm
says : “ Our invention is simplicity itself. Instead of
introducing a wrest-pin from the front, driven into the
wood like a nail, we introduce a steel pin from the
back, fitted nicely into a hole drilled in a solid metal
plate, which is part of our solid metal frame. The pin
has a conical butt fitting a conical shoulder in the
drilled hole. A tension screw (or stud) presses the pin
against the shoulder, thus controlling the pin and im-
parting any desired tension. The strain of the pin is
taken up securely by the iron frame, and all the vibra-
tion of the string is conserved. This system facilitates
the work of the tuner, and the string will remain per-
manently at any desired pitch.”
It is the aim of the firm to make every detail in their
own factory, thus controlling the quality of the materials
and workmanship, and ensuring that each instrument
will sustain the high standard achieved by them. The
large demand for their pianos has fostered a spirit of
enterprise, which has enabled them to overcome what
have been almost insurmountable difficulties and taught
them the important lesson of self-reliance. Being far
removed from, and not always satisfied with, the supply
of “parts” of the piano, they found it expedient to
devise machinery for making their sconces, action stan-
dards, pressure-bars, castors, pedals and other parts.
They found that by making them they were sure of
their quality and consequent durability.
Messrs. Beale & Co. have published a pamphlet which
gives many illustrations of the processes of manufacture.
This and a splendid catalogue of their instruments,
which is printed in three colors, will be sent to
anyone interested. Several of the illustrations are
given herewith.
Those who have seen Messrs. Beale & Co’s manu-
factory—and they are many, from the Prime Minister of
Australia down to the commonef— say that it is a model
one, and that the various machines and appliances for
the processes of construction are superior in every
respect. Numerous musicians have also given like
endorsement, and two of the directors of Messrs. J.
Lyons and Co. were much impressed during their recent
visit. These gentlemen personally inspected the fac-
tories.
Every department of their large factory at Annan-
dale, Sydney, is fully equipped, and in many instances
machinery is employed that has been invented and
made by the firm in their own shops. Among these are
the facilities for casting their patent combined metal
frame and wrest-plate, and their original automatic
machines, one of which, for example, makes ornamental
thumb-screws from metal blanks cast in the foundry.
It grasps the blank, turns it, faces it, drills a hole in it,
makes the thread, and cuts it the right length.
There are thirty departments embraced in the process
of preparing the materials and manufacturing. These
include the quay and yards at Rozelle Bay, for receiving,
stacking and open-air seasoning of timber; shelter
sheds for dry timber and the factory ; modern kilns for
seasoning by heat and moisture ; iron foundries electri-
cally fitted ; brass foundry, for brass and bronze
fittings ; blacksmiths’ shop ; iron shops, for drilling,
turning, fitting, grinding, screw working, and for pro-
ducing the plant; shop for enamelling, brass finishing,
and metal polishing, veneer sawing and slicing, drying
by patent system, matching and preparing and laying
by a patent method from three to nine plies ; timber
machining shops for the manufacture of all wood parts,
joiners’ shop, scale-drawing department, cabinetmakers’
shop, French polishers, carvers, keyboards, action
making, frame making, action fitting, case fitting,
regulating, polish finishers, tuning and intoning,
packing and shipping.
The firm acknowledge the hearty co-operation of their
workmen, whom they claim are second to no other
craftsmen in the world. They have been quick to learn
and to adapt to new conditions their former experience,
and their distinct individuality is reflected, much to
their credit, in their work. Their employees number
over 300 in the factories, and their annual disburse-
ments for wages in the making and selling of the
instruments are over They have branches in
every city of the Commonwealth, and do the whole of
their selling through these. Their pianos have been
unequivocally endorsed by the most eminent men of
Australia.

AT POVERTY POINT.
Herbert Flemming, who had been broken in health for
two or three years, died last week at Menzies’ Hotel, Mel-
bourne. His age was perhaps a little more than 53, but,
anyhow, he passed out long before his time. A mighty
fine athletic-looking fellow was Herbert Flemming in his
young Australian days when he played ingenuous lovers,
lurid villains, or elderly character parts for “ the Firm.”
The writer remembers him as the “juvenile lead” —a
quite godlike figure—in “ The Parvenu,” at the original
Princess’s Theatre, Melbourne, nearly a quarter of a
century ago. His association with the Broughs and
Boucicault dated back to the first Australian production
of “ The Magistrate,” after which he appeared with
Charles Warner at the Royal and the new Princess’s.
Never a conspicuously clever actor, he was always effect-
ive, and when his personal appearance got a fair chance
the girls thought him lovely indeed. Sometime in the
early ’9o’s he went to England, and was next heard of
hereabouts as a manager in S’Africa. He had been some
14 years away from Australia when he returned—a stout,
weather-beaten Flemming—bringing Mel. B. Spurr with
him. Spurr’s entertainment was a remarkable success,
and manager Flemming made so much money by it that
he was presently able to go back to England and organise
the Brough-Flemming co. In the meantime, Spurr had
died in Australia. In “ The Walls of Jericho ” Flemming
made his first and best appearance with his co-manager,
but even then he was beginning to be a sick man. It was
an ill-fated firm. Brough died, and for a while Flemming
carried on the business under the old names, acting,
when his health permitted, some of the parts that his
late partner would have filled. Then, at the expiration
of the partnership period, Flemming went again to Eng-
land, and came back to make a fresh start with a com-
pany of his own, which was playing at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s the night before he died. He was to have appeared
in “ Simple Simon ” two nights later. With him, as it
had been with Brough, the worries of the actor hastened
the manager’s end, and, like Brough and Spurr before
him, Herbert Flemming went very near to dying on the
boards.
“ Sceneshifter ” : I am glad to see the Beatty-Mclntosh
co. Is going to revive that fine old-timer, “ She Stoops to
Conquer.” I have kindly memories of previous revivals
of the comedy, which Oliver Goldsmith originally called
“ The Mistakes of a Night.” Remember Louise Pomeroy,
Marie de Grey, Mrs. Bernard Beere, Mrs. Robert Brough,
and Mrs. Brown-Potter as Kate Hardcastle. Of the five,
I give the palm to Mrs. Brough. Mrs. Bernard Beere,
who staged the comedy twice at Sydney Criterion in 1892,
after the Royal fire, was too tall and stately for the
character, and it was very difficult to account for young
Marlow’s folly in mistaking so elegant a creature for the bar-
maid of a wayside inn. However, the ‘‘English Bernhardt,”
as I have heard her called, played with spirit in this scene,
and I well recall the demure tones of her reply to Marlow,
“ Nectar? nectar? That’s a liquor there’s no call for in
these parts. French, I suppose. We keep no French
wines here, sir.” Generally speaking, Mrs. Beere’s man-
ner was too polished and town-bred. Her Lady Teazle
was more convincing. Louise Pomeroy, a ’Murkan star,
who first visited this country in the ’eighties, and who
was a ravishing Cleopatra at Sydney Royal in, 1882, in-
cluded Goldsmith’s comedy in her repertoire. I saw her
in it at the now defunct Queen’s Theatre in Princes-st.,
Dunedin, where she had the support of her hubby,
Arthur Elliott, also Charles Hall, as Hastings, J. G.
Joyce as old Hardcastle, and Blanche Lewis (now the
wife of Albert Norman, Bland Holt’s erstwhile stage
villain) as Mrs. Hardcastle. A fine comedian, J. J.
Kennedy, who figured with Billy Hoskins in a memorable
revival of “ The Comedy of Errors,” was Tony Lumpkin.
What a treat was the Brough-Boucicault version in four
acts ! Percy Lyndal was the lover, Bob Inman his pal,
Leopold a comical Diggory, William Holman (still with
us) was Sir Charles ; Bob Brough made a glorious Tony,
and his mother, Miss Rorner, a perfect Mrs. Hardcastle.
It was in 1896 that the Bellew-Potter crowd played the
piece, but La Gown Trotter was rotten. Charles Berkeley
made a fine Tony Lumpkin, when he got a show at the
character.

LITTLE BOY IN CHARGE : “ Conic along , gents.
Better luck next time. ’AVE another shy!”
Harry Rickards has left his English estate, where for
the past few months he has lived a life of rural ease amid
cows, milkmaids, lambs, goats, and other phenomena
of the sort which he had till recently only encountered in
the form of stage props, and embarked for Sydney. Harry
is now only a showman by spasms, as it were. He has
prospered so exceedingly in the past few years that he has
been enabled to leave his various “ houses” in the charge
of managers, and be that for which Nature, in all likeli-
hood, originally designed him—a grand old British squire.
Henry is to be entertained at a concert and supper by the
local citizens on his arrival, in recognition of his services
to Art, his geniality, and other alleged achievements and
qualities.
“ Sceneshifter ”: The revival of the seldom-acted
“Twelfth Night” by Margaret Anglin recalls a few
memories. It was superbly done by Musgrove’s company
at the Sydney Royal in 1903, with W. H. Denny as Mal-
volio, Dora Rignold as Viola, Maud Milton as Maria, Nora
Kerin as Olivia, Athol Ford as Sir Toby Belch, Oroker
King as Sir Andrew, and Charles Kenningham as a sweet-
voiced clown. Boiled down to three acts, and graced
with lovely scenery and costumes, this revival seemed to
promise a long run, which it didn’t have. Two or three
weeks was all Mussy could get out of his edition de luxe
of the Bard’s comedy. In 1882, at the same theatre,
eventuated Louise Pomeroy’s notable production, in
which she proved a splendid Viola. Her support included
Herbert Flemming as Sebastian, Theo Hamilton as Sir
Toby, J. B. Steele as Malvolio, Harry Leston as Sir
Andrew, J. Musgrave as the clown, Lena Ellis as Maria,
and Jessie Gray as Olivia. Alfred Clint made a big
feature of the scenery, and a very pretty dance closed the
comedy. In Maoriland, Louise Pomeroy doubled the
roles of Sebastian and Viola. Another ’Murkan star,
Janet Warldorf, played “Twelfth Night” in Melbourne.
Augustin Daly, the one time big Yankee manager, was a
great and original producer of Shakspeare. He did the
comedy in three scenes—Olivia’s House, the Duke’s
Palace and Olivia’s Garden, and repeated each. Daly did
not adopt the usual Elizabethan setting, but laid the
scene in a classical period. The court of the Duke of
Illyria was a picture of magnificence which might
have suggested the palace of Antiochus the Great.
Irving played it at the London Lyceum in 1884, but it
was a bitter frost. The Thames almost froze over because
of it. Much of this was owing to his original misconcep-
of Malvolio. During the brief run he entirely re-con-
structed the character, and in the mad scene no longer
grovelled on the stage and caught straws. He, as the
situation really seenjs to demand, stood up, erect and in-
dignant, as a man unjustly deprived of his liberty would.
Irving overloaded the five acts of his version with
gorgeous scenery, there being no less than 16 changes,
most of them heavy “ sets.”
“ Lyre ” : Re the National Opera Company. “ Bohemian
Girl” follows “ Maritana.” Balfe (1808-1870) and Wallace
(1814-1865)were contemporaries and rivals. “The Bohemian
Girl” came in 1843, “ Maritana ”in 1845—a glorious pair
indeed. Wallace’s delicious ballads show thought and
polish. Balfe seems to have composed more freely, in
spontaneous rills from the fountain of melody, and indeed
he gave himself no time to think. How different the
troublous vagabond life of Wallace from the steady pros-
perity of Balfe, taken by the hand by all, from
Rossini and Cherubini onwards 1 His multifarious
operas were Italian, French and English. What
mountains of fine music evaporate ! As for Wallace,
I cannot help thinking he was a bit of a Munchausen. I
knew a man who knew him in Sydney. He seemed to be
only a humble music teacher. He was little more than a
lad when he arrived there, aged 21, in 1835. How did he
go sheep farming? Then it seems to me his life was
saved by the Maori chief’s daughter because he composed
an opera, in London, in the “Pocahontas” vein, called
“The Desert Flower.” Why did he go whaling? His
musical genius was enough to carry him along even in
such remote places and times. His travels all over India,
before the railways, must be exaggerated. Also his
tobacco and piano speculations, etc., in South America.
Who vouches for him ?
“Melb. “She Stoops to Conquer” is underlined at
Melbourne Royal. Goldsmith’s masterpiece and Sheridan’s
“ Rivals ” are the finest of racy English comedies. “ The
School for Scandal ” ranks higher, but is comparatively
French and artificial, with its crystal brilliancy and impos-
sible epigrams. When “ She Stoops to Conquer ” was first
placed in rehearsal, the two best actors in the company
threw up their parts as Tony Lumpkin and Marlow.
They said it was unmitigated rot. Everybody
prophesied failure, as with Sothern in “Our
American Cousin ”at the London Haymarket. Mathews
(not acting there at the time) saw a notice in the green-
room, “ Rehearse ‘ She Stoops to Conquer’ To-morrow.”
He persuaded manager Buckstone to force “ Our Ameri-
can Cousin ’’ahead. Buckstone and Sothern each made
£30,000 out of it. When Barry Sullivan managed the
Melbourne Royal he posted a notice, “ ‘She Stoops to
Conquer’ Next Saturday Night.” Charley Young, cast
for Lumpkin, protested he had not time for study,, and
left the establishment. Richard Stewart, Nellie’s
father, was immediately engaged, and found no diffi-
culty with Tony. It was one of Ooppin’s crack parts.
Rogers and Lambert both excelled as Hardcastle, and
Mrs. Phillips, mother of Hans of that ilk, was an ideal
Mrs. Hardcastle.
“C.S.G.”: Over the exuberance of the peanut-laden
youth who sits in Sydney Tivoli gallery these times, a dark
cloud, or smudge of misgiving, lies heavy, like a damper.
The cause, alas, is not far to seek. Irving Sayles is fast
losing the deafening blast of rag-time voice that he once
exploded nightly. His old ear-splitting howl is a
mere ghost of its former self. The very orchestra, which
at one time, when Irving’s “ turn ” was next, stood on its
hind legs and pawed the air with an exulting medley of
tumultuous sound, is now hushed and grave. It heralds
him with th e piano, not to say the pianissimo , stop on.
The spectacle of an outrageous voice slowly fading to
normal proportions makes the gallery feel sad.
“ S.S.” : One finds the reason of Miss Anglin’s liking for
“Zira”in Act 111., where she gets her great chance to
“pile it on,” and she piles it as if it were a pyramid
instead of a mere drama. The agony of Zira’s encounter
with Ruth Wilding is long drawn, but Miss Anglin saves
it from tediousness by her tremendous energy and fine
play of emotion. In the hands of 99 actresses out of 100
that lingering recrimination would fall flat, but the Anglin
saves the situation with great vigor, and the mere con-
sumption of physical energy probably excuses the heaving
bosom so much in-evidence. But, all the same, I had the
comment of a gallery neighbor on another big American
ringing in my ears : “ Lurnrne, she’s er great actress 1
Look et the play of her chest!” Large chest expansion
is as mucfi a feature in an actress as in an athlete.
“Hiphen”: I have a suggestion to make to producers
of emotional plays. It is that each emotional-looking
female who enters the theatre should be presented with
a small packet of cough drops. T’other evening I went
to see “The Thief.” After one act I began to think I
had made a mistake and had wandered into a consump-
tive sanatorium. Finally I came to the
conclusion that I had struck a theatre-
night of the One Lung Club or the Weak
Chested Association. But it was just
ordinary audience, for another night at
“The Truth” it was exactly the same.
Every tearful situation aroused a verit-
able avalanche of coughing. It was quite
a study. I gave up trying to listen to the
dialogue and started classifying the
coughs. There was the small, shy scrape
of the timid maiden lady. There was
the dry, husky rasp of she with the
doubtful past, the certain present and
the most uncertain future. There was
the pathetic little wheeze of the girl who
had that day quarrelled with her lover
in just the same (or nearly the same)
way as Margaret Anglin had fallen out
with Kolker. Loudest of all was the
strenuous bark of the stout lady who
hung ecstatically over the gallery-rails,
with the lemonade bottle slipping un-
heeded from her nerveless grasp. It was
all very interesting indeed ; but I had
not gone there (and paid) to collect and
classify coughs and keep them bottled
afterwards. Nor do I preserve dried
coughs pinned on cards as some people
do butterflies. lam not a collector. I only wanted to
hear Miss Anglin, and I couldn’t.
“Snell” : A young- Australian singer was suddenlj’’ ele-
vated from the ruck during the run of “ The Lily of Killar-
ney,” at Melbourne Royal, and put in some excellent
work without getting any newspaper credit. The im-
ported principal fell ill, and Rufus Ferguson was called
upon at shortest notice to essay Danny Mann. He had
not understudied, and had no preparation beyond what had
come through an observant eye and an attentive ear, but
he stepped into the pare gaily enough, and made good.
His Danny went brightly for two or three nights. The
press wasn’t looking, but the gallery got on to it.
Philip Wirth, of the Circus, had a cruel disappointment
the very day he returned to Melbourne from his latest
trip to Europe. In Berlin, or somewhere, he had fixed
up a star engagement with a man who dived 40ft. through
the air (all diving begins in the air by the way) on to an
inclined platform, striking it so exactly “flush ” with his
chest and outstretched arms that he slid down the soaped
surface without hurting himself—as a rule. The plane
was about 30ft. long, and by the time the rapid traveller
reached the bottom the audience had enjoyed a lovely
thrill. The feat was everything that Australia could wish
for. It would have revived memories of the intrepid
Peart (of Fitzgeralds’ Circus) who used to dive from a
giddy height into a canvas tank of water, until he struck
the edge of the tank with his chest and died of shock to
the system. On his way out to Australia Phil Wirth
dreamed of letters in the newspapers protesting against
the unwholesome excitement appertaining to the
dangerous performance of the man who dived upon the
greasy platform. He also prayed that Providence might
spare that hare-brained individual for a long engagement
in this country—for the sake of all parties concerned.
Alas ! On the very morning of his arrival in Melbourne a
cablegram informed Wirth that the diver had met his
death in Berlin the day previously. He had hit the edge
of the inclined plane instead of the flat thereof. By delay-
ing the catastrophe a few weeks the unfortunate daredevil
could have given Widths’ the splendid advt. of arranging
a public funeral for him—with the Circus band, mounted
on the six elephants, playing the “ Dead March” at the
head of the procession, and the giraffe bringing up the
rear.
“ Sceneshifter ”: It is a daring thing to introduce a
re-incarnated Christ as leading male on the London
stage—a stage that 10 years or so ago would not permit a
Sydney parson's Biblical play to be produced for fear of
“shocking the religious-minded.” J. K. Jerome’s new
piece, “The Passing of the Third Floor Back,” does it,
however, nightly at the London St. James’, and no one
takes offence. Forbes Robertson, of the beauteous voice
and the impressive presence, plays the Saviour. His role
is to mistake vice and humbug for virtue and truth —to
the confusion of the former qualities. It is a subtle and
original stage idea that one would not have looked for
from the cockney Mr. Jerome.
“Sideshow”: One of the few interesting baritone warblers
in Melbourne is Claude Hall, the amateur actor and re-
citer. Hearing him for the first time at Glen’s Concert
Hall the other night, I was struck by his artistic render-
ing of several pretty little “drawing-room” songs. He
knew exactly what he could do, and he did it admirably,
which is more than can be said for the young lady who
was giving the concert. Another pleasing item was a
violin solo by one Du Boulay, a tall, swarthy, young Aus-
tralian, who went abroad for his training, and was now
making a first appearance in Melbourne.

R.D. (South Africa): The Cape Times doesn’t know its
subject. The sugar “bounty” (so-called) was £335,916
for the financial year to 30th June, 1907—not £573,000.
That is to say, the Government collected £546,653 in
sugar excise, and remitted £335,916 as “ bounty,” so that
it was £210,000 odd in pocket instead of being £573,000
out of pocket. As the cane grown increased from
I, tons in 1902 to 3,950,340 tons in 1907, Australia
is feeling quite satisfied with its anti-Kanaka policy.
And as each State is credited with the excise on' the
sugar it uses, and debited with its share of the “ bounty,”
the tale about other States having to pay “hundreds of
thousands” to support the sugar-growing States is sheer
rubbish Shrimp: Sorry it isn’t good enough

Prepared to defeat the world’s champion
By treacherous foul play.
The Russian appealed to the Referee,
While cheers and applause
Rang out for the American
Who gouged with his claws.
Bruised, bleeding, and half-blind,
The Russian sank to the mat,
And declined to resume wrestling
With the wild human cat.
The match was a grim farce,
A bloodthirsty display.
Gotch won the contest
By loathsome foul play.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
E.R.M. : Picture of man eating soup gave us the ex-
hausted sensation. Picture not very artistic and joke
not very g00d.... H. Moorhead : Regret they are quite
unsuitable P. G. : Illustration not strong enough to
support extremely feeble jest... .Olave Ayliffe : There
are things about j’our picture that are better left unsaid.
... .G.B. :In your sketch you have accomplished an un-
precedented feat: you have libelled both Bent and Reid
as to their looks.
Some deadly results have been got at the
Port Melbourne rifle ranges from a new explosive
called Pomeroid. Martini-Henry bullets weigh-
ing 372 grains were charged with 13 grains of the
explosive and fired at oil drums, empty or filled
with water, at heavy piebes of timber, and at
boulders, and the cheerful substance blew them
all to pieces. Also a bullet fired through a canvas
target exploded on that slight resistance. John
Pomeroy, the inventor, considers he has arrived
at something good, and if Australia had only its
arsenal and ammunition factories in going order it
would be in a position to keep that good thing for
itself, and so cause possible enemies to think twice
before landing once.

KUGELNANNS
PURE /lERBAL SKIN SOAP
IMPORTANT ANALYSIS. I
ARTHUR B. CHATER, Fellow of the Chemical Society; Examiner in Chemistry
to Queensland Pharmacy Board ; Public Analyst for City of Brisbane.
Analytical Laboratory, South Brisbane, July 12th, 1905.
Messrs. H. E. KUGELMANN & CO.
D ear Sirs, —Having made an analysis of “ H. E. Kugelmann’s Pure Herbal Skin
Soap,” I find it to be an absolutely pure Soap, containing no free Alkali, which has an
injurious action upon the human skin. It should therefore be suitable for application to
any human skin, or for use as a dentifrice. It also contains extracts of medicinal herbs
which the proprietors claim as a trade secret, and to have a curative effect upon the skin.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) ARTHUR B. CHATER.

” • .j.
Gentlemen, —I have made a careful analysis of a sample of “ Kugelmann’s Pure
Herbal Skin Soap," which I find to be composed of vegetable oils and fats saponified
with pure alkali.
It contains no free alkali nor any substance deleterious to the most delicate skin.
The perfume and color are both of natural and harmless plant origin, neither having any
trace of animal or poisonous materials.
Having powerful but non-poisonous antiseptics thoroughly incorporated in the process
of manufacture, this Soap possesses healing properties which will remove diseases of the
skin and restore it to a healthy condition.
It is a beautifully-finished article, comparing favorably with similar imported Soaps,
and it used regularly as an adjunct of the toilet, it will assist in keeping the body in
health, and will have a pleasing, soothing effect on the skin.
Yours faithfully,
F. H. MOLESWORTH, F.C.S., F.G.S., M.5.C.1., London,

ROM the stand-
point of the In-
terstate tourist,
Queensland is
full of interest.
It is more—it is
full of wonders!
From Brisbane to Thursday Island
it has enough scenery of the imposing
with ;? rd<l, ' 1 t ° l m:lke Ule tripper drunk
th ltl T ! ; '- Lin - the truest
' ° ' tC!UI Jesa,d aho "t it is that it doesn’t
;; und-,t inebriates ! The mind reels with the
beauty of it, while the sight is, in a loose way of
speaking staggered with its opulence. With the
chest of soils and a tropical climate, with
• 16 P ar t‘eular forms of tropical growth,
. tre ®. and creeper and flower, growing
>n prodigious luxuriance, its effect upon the
Stranger is easily understandable. To-day there
are men going to Queensland to take up land,
■ ,• t the same time, the steamers of the Five
ompanies are taking an increasing number of
tourists. But the tourist traffic is not as great as
it might be-perhaps because the inhabitants of
the bouth have yet to learn a lot about their
northern countrymen and the land they live in
Victoria and New South Wales are muffii better
known to the bulk of Australians, just so much as
most are more familiar with Sydney and Mel-
bourne than they are with Brisbane
Brisbane is a small town to the southern eve
which is used to largeness in city growths, but it
is a bright one, and nicely situated on a bunch of
bids, through which the Brisbane River crawls
■in the shape of a tortured snake. There
are views to be had there which are
worth stealing in a pocket kodak; and
t lere are air and good sunshine to keep the
spirits out of cold storage. Also, there are
plenty of life and heaps of amusements,
ranging from high drama to sea-pad-
dhng; so the visitor is in no danger
of expiring from utter nothing-
ness. Moreover, the deep sea
steamers of the Five Com-
panies can wander up the
stream right into the centre
of the city’s digestion, so to
speak, and lean up against
the buildings in Queen-street.
An improved river has led
to that improved navigation. By dredging
a-nd by the construction of training walls,°the
river is now damp to the depth of 24ft. at
lo w tide—thus allowing big boats to paddle up from
More ton Bly in about two hours. The convenience
to the passenger is obvious. He steps ashore and
boards a tram with as much facility as he would in
bydney or Melbourne. And, talking about the
trams, Brisbane has a service that will surprise
the dictionary into its best efforts. The whole
city is linked up in a mesh of rails, and the trams,
which will only suspend motion at street corners
or white posts, fly along the roadways like scoot-
ing comets. Threepence will take the passenger
right through the city from one side to the other
while penny sections save those people who only
want to travel short distances from com-
plaining about extortion. By the trams, one
goes anywhere m Brisbane. Such largely charm-
ing spots as Breakfast Creek, Dutton Park
Mt. Coot-tha, Toowong and the Western Suburbs
are all reached by those swift public vehicles;
whde, even within the city itself, they’re as
handy as may be. Public buildings, leaning to
compactness and dignity rather than to grandeur,
Brisbane has like any other city of importance.
The Parliament Buildings in George-street, and
the Treasury Buildings in Queen-street are fine •
while others, such as the G.P.0., are at least
worth a tram-ride. Gardens and parks, wherein
the tired stranger may get an idea of the luxuri-
ance of the local foliage, are plentiful. The
Botanical Gardens, on the wedge of earth that
steals out into the river, so to say, are valuable
for their big collection of tropical and sub-tropical
plants and, on. warm days, are as enticing
as cool bars. Other gardens are Albert Park
with an observatory tower, providing a spacious
bird s eye view of Brisbane; Musgrave Park a
gay resort, with cricket pitches and lawns for
respectable games such as bowls; and the Acclima-
tisation Society’s Gardens, wherein may be found,
despite its battlemented name, a great show oF
Queensland orchids. Outside fhe city itself, one
can easily knock a large cavity in a week in ’visit-
mg and recording. One can go out to the Enog-
gera Reservoir, picnic if need be. (it’s a favorite
picnic spot), or just lounge around and praise the
view, which is idyllic—if it’s nothing else!
-Nudgee, with its pineapple gardens and sea-
jeach ; bandgate, a seaside resort, similar in
popularity to St.. Kilda or Manly; Red-
cliffe, another attractive resort on Moreton
ii ■ , old ?™ ek ' »'ie of the sources of
the. .Brisbane Water Supply, and set in a fistful
of forest-grown hills and gullies; Brookfield,
notable for its strawberry and orange cultivation-
all of those are within a few miles of the city, and
may be visited at the price of two or three
shillings per head. And that doesn’t exhaust the
list. X here are others, but, by keeping to the
them 010 "’ ' vds ’ tor won t trouble any about
After Brisbane there is still a whole State to be
considered, but unless the stranger has about a
century-and-a-half to spare—and he can’t do that
without neglectinghis business or pursuits a trifle—
he won t have time to study it in detail. But, given
two or three weeks, he can see quite enough to im-
press him, and can then take the balance foreran ted.
if he s wise, he’ll board the boat again,“and go
upward to Rockhampton, which is a wee bit back
from the coast at Keppel Bay. Rockhampton is
interesting, in that it is adjacent, or rather not
tar distant from the great Mount Morgan gold
anc \, c ?Pf! er . mines, in themselves worth the trip
north if their is nothing else to look at. The city
is itself up-to-date, comfortable, and inviting:
the principal city in a large church diocese ; and,
like other Queensland places, full of luxuriant
gardens. If Rockhampton is enticing, Mackay
a few hours journey away, is equally so.
Une of the principal centres of the cane in-
dustry, it may now be seen in the middle of its
season which extends from July over the latter
half of the year. Those who take interest in
great Australian industries will feel impelled to
have a look over the cane mills and watch the
manufacture of sugar. Even Bowen and Towns-
ville may be visited, time and weather permitting,
as they won’t fail to surprise. Bowen is noted for
its many extensive orchards and its pastoral
pursmtSr-whilstTownsville, the commercial capital
of INortl.i Q.,.and the port of a
vast area of mineral and
toral country, won’t be
found by any means
disappointing. Other
places could be men-
tioned',' but if the
visitor sees all that
have been touched
upon he’ll find
that ' his trip will
be crowded with pic-
turesqueness and
things new. ,

" INSECTICIDE “
THE- GREAT INSECT DESTROYER


When the piano duty was before the Aus-
tralian Parliament the lying yell of the Freetrade
gang was that such a duty would be nothing more
or less than a subsidy to Beale and Co. There
wasn’t enough piano business in Australia to sup-
port more than one factory, even if we could make
pianos in Australia, which, of course, we couldn’t,
though we were doing it all the time. Also, if we
made pianos, it would not be a genuine manufac-
tory, but merely the fitting together of imported
parts. And so on and so forth ad, lib., regardless
of the fact that in the only existing Australian
factory almost everything was made on the pre-
mises, down to the screws and pins. On
Friday last, at Richmond (Vic.), the foun-
dation stone of Mr. Wertheim’s piano fac-
tory was laid down, in the presence of
a distinguished company which included the
great Tommy Bent. So within the year Australia
will have two big piano factories in full blast, and
the chances are that more will follow. The duty
on pianos is 30 per cent, general and 25 per cent,
preferential. So far the duty has not had the
effect elf closing up the fountains of Australian
music, jas foretold, and the weary night-hawk is
still soothed on his homeward way by the strains
of “ The Merry Widow ” waltz and other classic
pieces. But the d.uty has made it more profitable to
manufacture pianos in Australia than to import
them, and they are being manufactured accord-
ingly.* '
1 he person who fills up the bottle of the good
brand with inferior liquor struck a cold time in
Victoria recently. The Court fell tooth and nail
on two liquid vendors who filled up with an
inferior article bottles bearing the trade mark of
Dixon and Co.’s largely-demanded O.T. punch.
“ O.T. i” as everybody knows, is one of the drinks
of the gods, and is frequently used by Zeus him-
self as a nightcap, and the caitiffs who use its
bottles to dispose of an inferior article are liable
to a minimum fine of £lOO. Caitiffs had better
make a note of this.*

According to recent estimates, the British
unemployed number 15,000 in Manchester and
Salford, 12,350 at Liverpool, 12,000 in the Tyneside
towns, 10,000 at Sunderland, 11,000 at Sheffield,
and about 20,000 at Glasgow. The local Labor
party proposes as a remedy a reduction of working
hours, so that more ants can get on to one bit of
meat or more men live on one bit of work. But
if the bit of Work which now supports 10 men is
made to keep 12, either their wages (which are
low enough already) must be reduced, or else the
cost of their product must go up. And if the cost
of the product goes up, it will be still less able
than it is now to compete, under Ereetrade con-
ditions, against the imported article, and increased
foreign competition will tend to take the bit of
work away altogether. Then, instead of support-
ing 12 men or 10 men, it will support nobody.
On page 11 appears the advertisement of
a well-meaning but soon to be disillusioned man
who proposes to raise an Australian navy by
voluntary contribution. He hopes to get at least
one pound per annum from each Australian adult
during the year, with which to provide the Aus-
tralian Government with the means of construct-
ing a battle fleet. Australia has tried the volun-
tary business in many ways, and in every one of
them it has failed to justify itself. It has tried
voluntary defence, with disastrous results. It
has experimented with voluntary municipal
cleanliness, and the undertakers have been
kept busy. It has tested voluntary education,
and the victims of it are hewers of wood and
drawers of water even unto this day. And now
this patriotic individual proposes to try voluntary
battle-fleet building. It is up to the advocates of
the voluntary business to dig deep into the depths
of their pockets and send the money along in
shoals, for if ever a country needed a battle fleet
it is Australia, and if ever the voluntary or
Private Enterprise system had a chance to justify
itself it is this one. Supporters of the idea are
requested to send no money at present, but to
communicate with “Rangitira,” Box 247, G.P.0..

Suffered Incessantly for a Year—
" They were Very Large and Pain
was Dreadful —Could Hardly Bear
Clothing—Health Much Impaired.
WAS ABSOLUTELY CURED
BY CUTICURA REMEDIES
“I have to thank Cuticura Reme-
dies for completely curing me of one
of the worst attacks of boils it is pos-
sible to imagine. I suffered from
boils incessantly for a year, and I was
So unsuccessful in trying remedy after
remedy that I began to despair of ever
getting my system clear of this dis-
tressing ailment. My shoulder and
back were principally affected. Any
one who has had a single boil knows
how dreadfully painful boils are, so it
will be evident how much I suffered
when I tell you that I had four large
ones. They would be a long time com-
ing up and so very painful all the time
that I could hardly bear my clothes
on. They were very large, one on my
back extending to the size of a five-
shilling piece, while the smallest was
as big as a sixpence. My health suffered
much as the result of the attack and I
got info a very run-down condition.
After I had tried other means without
any benefit, I read of a cure by Cuticura,
and though I had not much faith, I
thought I could not do any harm in
trying Cuticura Soap. So I bought
a tablet and after I had washed the
affected parts a few times I noticed
such a great improvement that I de-
cided I could not do better than try
the whole Cuticura Treatment. I got
the Cuticura. Soap, Ointment, and Pills,
and my progress from that time was
truly wonderful. A great change for
the better took place almost immedi-
ately and now, well within three months
from when I started with the Soap, I
can pronounce myself absolutely cured.
Cuticura Remedies have got the disease
right out of my system. I am ex-
tremely grateful for the great benefit
I have derived, and I wish most ear-
nestly to recommend Cuticura Remedies
to every one troubled with boils. I
shall never be without Cuticura Soap..

The Truth Must Stand.
You know the proverb, “A lie has no
legs ” —it cannot stand when put to the test.
If the public try an article advertised to
possess certain merits and the advertised
merits are found to have " not a leg to stand
upon,’’ that article cannot gain in the public
favour. Sunlight Soap has steadily gained
in the public favour from the date of its
•'ntroduction, and long ago it attained, and
: t continues to maintain, its pre-eminent
position amongst Soaps of having the largest
sale in the world.
A good example is set

o
The immense number of orders for
Frootoids, sent by post direct to the Pro-
prietor, is convincing proof that the
Public appreciate their splendid curing
power over the above-named complaints.
Frootoids are elegant in appearance and
pleasant to take; they are immensely
more valuable than an ordinary aperient;
they remove from the blood, tissues, and
internal organs, waste poisonous matter
that is clogging them and choking the
channels that lead to and from them.
The beneficial effects of Frootoids are
evident by the disappearance of headache,
a bright, cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient medi-
cine to take when any Congestion or
Blood Poison is present, or when Conges-
tion of the Brain or Appoplexy is present
or threatening. They have been tested,
and have been proved to afford quick
relief in such cases when other aperients
have not done any good at all.
Frootoids act splendidly on the liver;
a dose taken at bed-time, once a week, is
highly beneficial.
A constipated habit of body will be
completely cured if the patient will on
each occasion, when suffering, take a dose
of Frootoids, instead of an ordinary
aperient. The patient thus gradually
becomes independent of Aperient Medi-
cines.

Britain's Alleged Horse-Sense.
A Lord Somebody, who seems to have sounded
Parliamentary opinion on the matter, declares
that the British Government would get the sup-
port of /5 per cent, of the House of Commons if
it were to table a Bill for the encouragement
of cavalry horse-breeding in Britain and the
prohibition of 'horse exports from the country. The
policy of Protection in certain small matters
appeals to the dullest Freetraders. They can
understand how unwise it is to let the local manu-
facture of horses decline for want of Government
support, even as they understand the absurdity of
permitting cheap American hops to imperil the
respectable old industry of hop-growing in a coun-
try famous for its beer. But, whilst they would
willingly exchange “freedom” of trade for “restric-
tion” of trade as regards hops and horses, they shut
their eyes and ears to the fact that a little clique
of mine-owners is robbing the country of its coal
possessions and selling the fuel to foreign navies
and manufacturers. An embargo on the exporta-
tion of gee-gees.is desirable, but it should be pre-
ceded by a full stop to Britain’s foreign trade in
coals. And that is something not to be thought
of by the House of Commons. The millionaire
mine-owners would bring their wide range of in-
terest to prevent any such un-Hinglish interference
with the liberty of the subject. Likewise the
mighty body of ship-owners would rise in their
fat wrath to oppose it. The miners who pick and
truck millions of tons of coal for annual export
would also be horribly indignant. Government
restriction of Britain’s madness in that respect is
out of the question thus far. Horse-breeding is
quite another story. Many of the noble persons
who own the earth would gladly take a personal
interest in the production of big-boned steeds if
the State gave them a bonus on the output and
the War Office [laid £4O a head for the animals.
And that’s how it happens that 75 per cent,
of the House of Commons members are pre-
pared to rob British trade of its .freedom in one
particular line. They are willing to apply the
principles of wicked Socialism to one industry for
the sake of the common weal, 'out they couldn’t
think of abating their antagonism to Tariff Pro-
tection and Socialism in general!
♦
“D.M.W.” writes from Maoriland :
The political atmosphere of Maoriland is a great dent 1
more electric than it has been for years past. In a feu
months there will be a general election, the first sinci
one-half of the present electors became qualified to vote
in which the large personality of Richard John Seddon
will no longer count. No one can really gauge popular
feeling. The Ward Government is much spoken against
in many electorates that were intensely, blindly attached
to Seddon. As a reactionary force, the Farmers’ Union,
will probably make itself felt. The Labor party is pro-
foundly dissatisfied, although far from being united in
opinion and aim. There are large new organised Labor
forces in rural districts, whose vote is practically an un-
known quantity. The Cold-Tea party, with its‘demand
for National Option and shutting of pubs by
the vote of a bare majority, is now fairly
in politics, and thousands of electors will sink
all their other political opinions in order to slay Mr.
Publichouse. The Ministry itself rouses no enthusiasm
and inspires little confidence. There is a steadily-grow-
ing uneasiness with regard to its finance. The opinions
of its members are so much at variance as to create a
large distrust of their policy. The whole constitution of
the Cabinet is felt to be based on a series of compromises,
and the holding of office is to each Minister of far
greater importance than adherence to any political
principle. So much is this the case that the Leader
of the Opposition might comfortably accept a portfolio
without more sacrifice of anything in the way of con-
viction than the rest of those who form the Ministry.
Whether the electors will tolerate a continuance of this
state of affairs or not remains to be seen, but not very
much in the way of choice is left to them. Massey stands
for a good deal that is reactionary, but he professes a
wholesome hatred of borrowing, and that may bring him
votes.
Ward, to meet this danger, throws out an immense
programme of roads and bridges. But they are mostly
loan money roads and borrowed bridges, and the country
begins to wear a really alarmed expression on that subject.
“ Kamarooka ” writes
The Victorian Government makes a good thing out of
deluded selectors who take up bits of the 2,000,000 acres
of State lands Bent says he has on hand, and then when
the deluded settlers find that the land is no good and
leave it in disgust and with curses, the Government is
the richer by the survey fees paid on the abandoned land,
and then baits are held out to catch other deluded
settlers to take up the same land and again pay survey fees
on it. And if the second lot of settlers also find that
they have a piece of sterile desert and throw it up, they
lose the money they paid for survey fees, and so on. A
case in point is what is knowm as the Whipstick scrub, a
big area of State lands a few miles to the north of
Bendigo. About 40,000 acres of this were thrown open for
selection some four years ago in 200 and 300 acre blocks.
There was a terrific scramble on the part of cockies’ sons
and others to get a block, and the successful applicants
gleefully pulled out of their pockets cheques for £8 and
£lO apiece, which were handed over to the Government
in liquidation of the survey fees. The settlers, having
paid their tenners, bogged in like a mob of hogs on a
jamboree, and tore up the scrub, and tore in crops of
w’heat and oats, and then started to bog in and fence
their blocks, befoi the crops got too high. But after
they had shoved in a lot of posts and did various odd jobs
about the place, they went and had a look at the crops.
And when they looked they saw' no crops. Then they
waited a few months before they looked again, but still
there were no crops in sight, although the scrub
which was rooted out was growing again like the
Lfevil. So the first year passed, and it was a
dead failure for the settlers. A few', wiser than the rest,
said the land was no good to man or beast, and cleared off
it. The others said that they would have another go, so
they stopped, and rooted up the new crop of scrub,
and rooted in a new crop of wheat and oats,
finding time in the meanwhile to hand out a few
morepoundsto the Government for rent. The second
season was a bigger failure, if possible, than the first for
the wheat and oat crops, but the new crop of scrub was
taller and strong-er than ever. This was enough for most
of the remaining settlers, and with a collective curse they
packed up their belongings, and left the land, and their
visions of an earthly paradise upon it. Now', the same
land is again being advertised for selection, and the
survey fees are set down at from £8 to £lO for each block,
but nary a word about the fees having been paid onc»
before
“F.R.”: One of the most persistent cries of the
Tories who oppose compulsory cutting up of large
estates is that it will have a ruinous effect upon
our wool production. Even if it were true that
sheep would decrease in numbers, there is not
much in the argument, as cultivation is far more
remunerative than jumbucks. But, as happens
usually with Tory statements, this argument has
neither top nor bottom left when the facts are
ascertained. Victoria has cut up sundry big estates
during the past five or six years. Yet the Govern-
ment Statist now announces that the sheep have
increased from 11,455,115 in 190 G to 14,140,734 in
1908 (March). And the Statist unkindly adds that
“almost the whole of thisincrease (over 2,500,000)
is accounted for by the man who owns less than 2000
sheep.” And it is reasonable that this should be
so. In pastoral matters, as in agricultural ones,
the man with the gigantic holding seldom gets the
best out of his land. There is “ intense cultiva-
tion ”in sheep as well as in vegetables. Many a
big station might multiply its jumbucks by three
if it were cut into small areas—and multiply its
men by twenty or fifty.

DRUGS!
WHY don’t yon stop it? You are still doctoring, but changing doctors does not cure
you. You are trying one medicine after the other with the s tme disgusting disappoint-
ment. You are a “ medicine doser,” and the only change in you. condition is for the worse.
Why don’t you stop this medicine habit? Why don’t you avail yourself of
the modem remedy? Proceed on Nature’s own lines. Use the life-giving, healing,
strengthening forces .of Electricity ! This is the electric age. You can see on every
hand the wonders of Electricity. You don’t need doctors ; you don’t need medicine,
for medicine cives no nourishment. You DO need Electric Life Force. Use it as we
apply it and you will be well, strong and happy.
Nearly every ailment which afflicts humanity, outside of contagious diseases, is due to the breaking-
down of some vital organ. When a certain part fails to do its allotted task the entire human
machinery goes to smash. The only way to regain health—even life—is to rebuild the weak part
which has caused all the trouble by obtaining a new supply of vital electric energy. This can
only be properly done with the new improved
DR. McLAUGHLIN’S ELECTRIC BELT.
There is no disputing the virtue in Electricity as a cure for weakness and pains. The brainiest doctors living now admit it, but there has
been a doubt that anyone had mastered the best way of applying it. The doctor’s battery is crude—shocks too much, and at best can only be
applied for half-an-hour at a time, which is not enough to do any good. Those other machines in a doctor’s office never reach the trouble. . .
Electricity, as applied by DR. McLAUGHLIN’S ELECTRIC BELT, is the modern, up-to date method. No shock, no burning or
blistering, and you wear it for hours at a time while sleeping or during the day.
£5OO REWARD.
We guarantee every Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt sold by us to give a powerful current of
genuine electricity which can be instantly felt, and we will forfeit <£soo to anyone proving
the contrary.
“Is a quick and lasting cure for Debility, Weakness of all kinds, Varicocele, Rheumatism, Weak Back, Sciatica,
mbago, Indigestion, Weak Kidneys, Failing Memory, and all evidence of Break-Down.

CURE.
Coughs, Bronchitis, Pneumonia,
Pleurisy, Asthma <fc Consumption
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its splendid healing power. Sufferers from Bronchitis, Cough, Croup
Asthma, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and rapid relief; and to those
who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It is most comforting in allaying Irritation
in the I hroat and giving Strength to the Voice, and it neither allows a Cough nor Asthma to become chronic, nor Consump-
tion to develop. Consumption is not known where “ Coughs ” have, on their first appearance, been properly treated with this
medicine. Do house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose or two is generally sufficient, and a complete
cure is certain. y

Food
The more delicate the state of health, the greater the
prostration from severe illness, the greater the need for
Benger’s Food.
To “start the stomach” after prostration, great exertion,
sickness, or enforced abstinence from food, use Benger’s Food.
Amid the uproarious demand for more
money made by Melbourne Hospital minions of alj
grades, the honorary doctors are beginning to
think hard. The Think makes them ponder the
desirability of asking for a rise in their own non-
existent salaries. They work for nothing except
glory and experience. As boys they left school
to become medicos. That meant five years at
the University (if they were lucky enough or
brilliant enough to pass successfully each year).
The majority of them were toiling at Pa’s
expense. Following this came the impera-
tive walking of the hospitals for necessary
experience at no pay a year. Only an extra-
ordinary person could earn more than tuppence
outside and alongside this work. No wonder
medicos want to charge when they grow feathers
on their wings ! They have waited long enough
without any real affluence coming to them.
How charming is the seriousness with which
the Briton takes the Society convention ! In the
London Daily Mail; one Lady Grove writes a
thrilling “special column ” on Visiting Cards and
what to do with them. She knows “a colonel
of exalted rank” who has a wife. The two were
doomed for a space to live in a provincial town.
The neighbors called. Now occurred what Lady
Grove cites as
an admirable example of delicate consideration for the
feelings of others, where the convention of their own
particular world was set at naught by a generally inac-
cessible couple in the tactful effort to diminish the dis-
tance between themselves and those they were brought
into daily contact with.
The degraded provincialists
almost invariably had their own and their husbands’
names jointly inscribed on one piece of pasteboard 1
Not so, of course, the exalted ones.
The colonel and his wife naturally had their names on
separate cards.
It was a ghastly situation. The Colonel and his
wife were faced with the grim alternatives
of (1) hurting the provincialists’ feelings by return-
ing their calls with cards which were correctly
inscribed, or (2) having fresh cards printed in imi-
tation of the provincialists’ cards, and jettisoning
social self-respect in the cause of kindly tact. A
brief struggle, and kindliness won. With jaws
doggedly set, the devoted pair went forth one
afternoon with cards on which, despite the rank of
the owners , their names were jointly inscribed !
It was not the proper thing, but it was magnifi-
cent. It was also humorless ; but that is a bulls-
eye which Lady Grove misses by a mile or so.

Retired.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE owns a little villa
Beside the Sydney shore,
This grizzled, grey, old skipper,
Retired, and sixty-four.
I often see him sitting
On his verandah chair,
The sea-wind gently blowing
About his foam-white hair.
Before him spreads the Harbor ;
And, telescope to eye,
He watches, late and early,
The ship-procession ,by. <
And spar and mast and funnel,
And engine, sail and screw,
They speak to him the language
Of that great world he knew.
They tell him of the countries
That lie so far away ;
The messmates and the cronies
Of his departed day.
His wife is sleeping yonder,
He laid her down at sea ;
A long-gone captain’s daughter,
A captain’s darling she.
And oft, I know, his glasses
Grow filmy with the dim,
Sad memories and longings
The brave ships bring to him.
He knows them all by number,
And most he knows by name ;
The whither of their going,
The whence their cargoes came.
And oft I see him pass ng
His hand across his eyes,
When hoot the outward sirens
And high Blue Peter flies.
The ports that they are bound for—
Ah, these he knows right well,
The light and buoy and beacon,
The foghorn and the bell.
He sees, in mind, the coastline,
He sees the storm-swept bay,
And down the foggy channel
He feels a cautious way.
He sees the docks of London,
Where once his lading he
To cheer his merchant owners
Delivered faithfully.
In dreams he sees the Indies,
In dreams he doth behold
The coasts of California,
The fevered Coasts of Gold.
The Cape and Horn, in fancy,
He beats around again,
In sunshine and in starshine,
In clear and calm and rain.
The clipper roads, he knew them
The infant days of Steam—
And ships, long dead, forgotten,
Go drifting through his dream.
Along that wide verandah
He paces to and fro ;
And with him walk the shipmates
Of years and years ago.
He hears the homing chanteys,
And on the poop he stands,
With ready crew beneath him
To follow his commands.
He dresses and he strips her,
He lays her course once more
From Boston to the Foreland,
From ’Frisco to the Nore.
I doubt not he is ready
His final Port to win ;
I doubt not that St. Peter
Will let the old man in.
His papers all in order ;
His manifest clear writ,
With many goodly items
Set down, in gold, on it,
One day he’ll take his passage
To that Uncharted Shore
Whence neither crew nor captain
Re-voyage evermore.

Dodgewick’s Divorce.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DODGEWICK never approaches me
from the front. He leaps on me from
the innermost recesses of a private bar,
or drags me backwards out of a crowd and says,
“Look here, old man, I’m in an awful hole!
Have you got any money on you ? ”
Dodgewick never specifies any amount. He
waits until he sees how much I’ve got, and then
borrows it until salary day. I don’t think Dodge-
wick has been paid any salary for at least 18
months, because up to now he owes me about £23. I
don’t mind that so much, because I earn an enorm-
ous living by being a clerk and can afford to be
generous to Dodgewick. It is the load of family
trouble he heaps on me that I object to.
Dodgewick seems to think that I take an in-
terest in him. He told me one night that the
only souls who ever gave him any sympathy were
barmaids and myself. Dodgewick seems to re-
quire more sympathy than any man who has
lived since the barmaid was invented.
Last night, at seven o’clock, as I was going into
the Royal, I was seized from behind and lifted
into a dark corner. Any ordinary man would
have concluded he was being garroted or ar-
rested. I just said, “ How much do you want,
Dodgewick?”
He sobbed on my collar and said that he didn’t
want money —he wanted sympathy.
I said, “Well, come in and see Lottie.”
Dodgewick choked down a sob and said that
Lottie was a painted woman.
I said that I’d always thought the painted
ones contained more sympathy than the other
sort.
Dodgewick said that he wanted my sympathy—
also my moral support. He said that his wife
wanted to get a divorce, and that I was to come
along and stop her. He seemed to take it for
granted that I could stop her.
Up to that moment I didn’t know that Dodge-
wick had a wife. I didn’t even know he had a
home. I never met him either going to or com-
ing from it, and he never alluded to anything of
the kind in his conversation. Therefore I was
astonished.
I tried to ask some questions, to get some de-
tails, but Dodgewick caught me by the arm and
hurried me along towards Chancery Lane, where,
I was given to understand, Dodgewick’s wife and
another lady were waiting with the family lawyer.
I asked Dodgewick what they were waiting for.
Dodgewick said they were waiting for me 1
“But,” I gasped, as we stumbled and rushed
together up Little Collins-street, “ where do 1
come into the story ? ”
Oh, don't talk,” he wailed, “don’t talk, for
God’s sake! I told them you’d explain every-
thing.”
“ But what have I got to explain ? ”
“Oh, for God’s sake don’t ask me! They’ve
been going into my past life ever since four this
afternoon, and I’m all kite high unless you back
me up and explain how things are ! ”
“ What things ? ”
“Everything! Smooth ’em over—tell ’em it
will be all right. Eix ’em up any way you like, so
long as you break up the meeting ! ”
“Dodgewick,” I said sternly, for I saw there
was no escaping it, “why didn’t you come
to me before ? It isn’t fair to call me in at this
late stage of the proceedings. Why didn’t you
come to me before ? ”
“I did!” he answered. “I’ve been round
town five times since four o’clock this afternoon.
I stop in that office and listen to those women
having hysterics until I can’t stand it any longer.
Then I tell them I’in going out to look for you.”
“Dodgewick,” I said, “have you told those
women that I’ll”
“ Here we are ! ” he said, and dragged me up a
dark hall-way. Before I had time to adjust what
thoughts I had on hand, Dodgewick rushed me
along to the door, flung it open, and pushed mein
in front of him.
I stood for a moment contemplating the scene
before me, and I must admit I was never in an
atmosphere more heavily charged with emotion
than that was.
There was a tear-sodden woman in the last stage
of exhaustion sitting limply by a desk, behind
which sat the most wretched man I have ever seen
alive. These two I took to be Dodgewick’s wife
and her solicitor, and I subsequently found my
supposition to be correct. The second lady—who
looked as if she had been having uninterrupted
hysterics for a fortnight—l put down as the Diffi-
culty.
The lawyer stood up as I entered. “Mr.
Dodgewick,” he said, “I presume this is your
friend ?”
“Yes,” muttered Dodgewick. “This is my
friend Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson—Mr. Gadge-
snap.”
“ Gadgestack,” corrected the lawyer, angrily.
Dodgewick didn’t apologise. He just sat down
in a chair and mopped his forehead like a man
who has dropped a heavy burthen of trouble.
Both the women looked appealingly towards
me, and the distraught lawyer motioned me to a
chair and resumed his seat.
“ Now, Mr. Jolinson, ” he said, “if you will be
so good as to tell us what you know, we may be
able to get this unfortunate misunderstanding ad-
justed and then all will be well. Mr. Dodgewick
has assured us that you can explain everything.”
Mrs. Dodgewick here burst into tears. “Oh !
do explain everything,” she sobbed. “ Tellers nit
about it! Tell us everything! ”
“ Tell them ! ” said Dodgewick, in adiollow voice
behind. . /
“Be perfectly frank with us/’ pleaded the
lawyer. f
The Difficulty sniffed damply?—almost appre-
hensively—and said something about “hating to
be suspected, ” or “ selected, ’ ’ or something to that
effect.
There was a slight pause.
“Now, Mr. Johnson ! ”
It was the gong. I cleared my throat and
started to spar for an opening. Speaking in my
most deliberate tone, I said : “Before I make any
statements I would like you to tell me what it is
you wish cleared up. It is very difficult for me,
arriving as I do in the midst of your delibera-
tions ” ——
“ Quite so,” interrupted the lawyer ; “ I under-
stand ! You mean to say you would rather reply
to specific instances ? ”
“ Exactly! ”
He turned to his client. “ Are you agreeable
to that, Mrs. Dodgewick ? ”
“ Oh, yes ! Yes !”
Then to the Difficulty: “Are you agreeable,
madam ? ”
The strange lady sniffed again—defiantly this
time —and asserted that “nobody could say any-
thing against her.”
“Very good,” said the lawyer, turning to his
desk and examining his notes. He laid his finger
on one and looked keenly at me.
“Well, Mr. Johnson, we will take the evening
of June 25th last. Mr. Dodgewick says you were
with him that evening, about ten o’clock, in the
private bar of The Old Bull and Bush, where
this lady was then employed. Will you kindly
give us your version of what occurred tlhere? ”
I looked again at the somewhat crumpled lady
in the chair, hesitated for one brief second, and
cried in joyful amazement, “ Lottie ! ”
She looked up at me with tear-stained eyes and
gave me a pathetic, friendly little nod. “ Hello,
Kid,” she faltered.
Mrs. Dodgewick stiffened audibly. (The snaky
swish of her garments was the hiss of Virtue at
Vice.)
“Well, Mr. Johnson?”
I dragged myself together. “So far as I can
remember, I met Mr. Dodgewick that night some-
where about 10 o’clock. I generally used to go in
there for a drink on my way home. I think Mr.
Dodgewick was there when I came in.”
“ What was he doing?”
“My recollection is not very clear, but I think
he was talking to Miss Latitude here.”
“Yes, yes. Was his manner affectionate to-
wards her ? ”
(Dodgewick shuffled nervously behind me.)
“ His manner was friendly.”
(Dodgewick sighed with relief.)
“Was his manner only friendly all the time?”
“Well ”
“Yes, Mr. Johnson?”
“ Well, I would rather not ”
Dodgewick leaped to his feet and cried “Stop!”
The solicitor leaped to his feet and demanded,
“ Why should we stop, sir ? ”
(Continued on next par/e.)


MISHAPS OF
CHILDHOOD.
Healthy youngsters seem to be always “in
the wars" cutting and knocking themselves
about and sustaining bruises and gashes,
the sight of which often make their
mothers turn their heads in horror. Just
what every home needs is Zam-Buk. A pot
of this Balm and a bandage on a handy
shelf, where they are ready for immediate
use, save untold pain, time and money.
Mrs. C. Hedges, Cash Store, Ravens-
wood, Queensland, says: “I have used
Zam-Buk Balm on my little daughter for
cuts and bruises, and it gives me pleasure
to testify to its valuable healing qualities.
The effect of the first application was
very soothing, and continuing to apply
it, the child’s wounds were speedily
healed. I have also tested its powers on
myself for a deep wound in the foot, caused
by a nail, which obstinately refused to
heal, but Zam-Buk effected a thorough
cure. I have recommended Zam-Buk Balm
to my friends, and its success has been
equally pronounced.”
Every Home Needs Zam-Buk

only perfect Healing Balm, is invaluable

Beauty’s Favourite.
The article which excels all others
in improving the beauty of the sßin
is naturally and deservedly beauty’s
favourite. Tbis has been the
acknowledged and honoured
position held by Pears’ Soap for
nearly 120 years. It won, and bas
maintained tbat position by virtue
of its complete purity, and by tbe
possession of tbose special emollient
properties wbicb soften, refine,
and impart natural colour to tbe

PEARS
Matchless for the Complexion.
“Because, Mr. Gadgesnip, I want to have a
word or two in private with Mr. Johnson before
he goes any further."
The maddened solicitor banged the table with
his fist, and shouted, “It’s—it’s highly improper,
and—and I won’t allow it, and my name isn't
Gadgesnip or Gadgesnap—or Gadge —anything
else ! It’s Gadgestack, sir ! G-a-d-g-e-s-t-a-c-k !
Remember that!”
Dodgewick strode over to the table and banged
it in exactly the same place as the solicitor had.
“ I’m going to have a word with my friend John-
son, and I don’t care a d —n —no, nor half a d —n !
—what you or any other pettifogging fool says !
As for your name, Mr. Gadgepot, I’ll call you any-
thing I like or I’ll call you nothing at all. While
we’re on the subject, I may as well tell you that I
think your name is an absurd one. I think that a
man with a name like yours ”
The solicitor, white with fury, put up an ad-
monishing hand. “That is sufficient, Mr. Dodge-
wick ! No vulgar abuse if you please !”
“Can I have a word with my friend, then !”
“You may,” sneered the lawyer, sitting down.
Dodgewick made toward the door and beckoned
me to follow. We walked up to the end of the
dimly-lit passage, and there in the dusty shadows
Dodgewick seized my arm and whispered hoarsely
that I’d have to see him through.
I said, “Of course! Ain’t I seeing you
through now?”
“No,” hissed Dodgewick, passionately, “I mean
you must see me right through ! Johnson, this is
no time for any paltry fiddling help ! This calls
for a sacrifice, Johnson! It calls for a big sacri-
fice ! ”
I answered him in a cool, collected way. I said,
“Well, if you can’t get out of it any other way, I
suppose you’ll have to make some sort of a sacri-
fice.”
There was a pause, and then he reeled, and
gasped, and clutched me in an excess of horror.
When at last he spoke, his voice sounded like a
man soliloquising in a cave. “My God! John-
son, surely you don’t expect me to make the sacri-
fice ! .. , My God ! .. . Johnson, don’t trifle with
me ! This is no time for trifling ! ”
“ But ”
“Don’t attempt to joke about it, Johnson !
Remember what I’ve done for you ! You must help
me, man ! You owe it to mts ! ”
Owed it to him! My brain stopped at the very
thought. Good lord ! if there was one man on
earth of whose debt I was free that man was
Dodgewick. How on earth could I owe things to
Dodgewick ? How could anyone owe Dodgewick
anything? Hadn’t I given him half my income,
and three-quarters of my time, and all my
thought ? What more did Dodgewick want ?
And intuition whispered, “ Your reputation ! ”
I broke from his grasp on the instant, crying,
“ No, I won’t !”
But he seized me as I turned to fly, and implored
me to save him. He held me firmly by the arm,
in the dark corridor, and begged and prayed me to
do my best for him, until at last he hypnotised me
into a weary acquiescence.
He made as if to drag me back with him, but I
cried in anguish, “Hold on! What am I going
to tell them now l Tell me what I’ve got to say ! ”
“Oh, say that Lottie’s your friend, and that
whatever spying sneak it was that told the tales
has been mixing us up ! ”
“No ! ” I yelled, “ I won’t do it ! I want my
reputation. I haven’t got much, but”
“ Your reputation !” he hissed. “Yourrepu-
tation ! D—n your reputation ! What the Devil’s
the good of a reputation to you ? What use have
you got for it ? What use has any single man got
for a reputation ? I’m married, and I’ve got to
look out for this sort of thing, but you’re free !
Good Heavens, Johnson ! I thought you at least
were above talking tripe about reputations. A
single man has no more use for a reputation than
ne has for a parasol. Leave the reputations to
the women, my boy—they’ve got some use for the
d—n things. If ever you see a woman drop her
brolly or her reputation, help the poor girl to
pick it up—but for Heaven’s sake don’t try and
sport one yourself! They’re women’s toys,
Johnson, and they suit a man just about as well
as a picture hat would ! ”
“Nevertheless,” I answered.
“Nevertheless be d—d ! Now come along in
and square this thing up! . . . No, it’s no use
talking rot —you’ve simply got to do this forme,
Johnson! Don’t funk it, man. Pull yourself
together ! Remember you owe it to me! ”
He dragged me, protesting, to the door, and
pushed me into the room, saying in a loud voice
as he did so, “No, Johnson, no ! I cannot screen
you any longer ! ”
“Screen me!” I shouted, turning on him.
“ I don’t want you to screen me! ”
I never realised until that moment what a great
actor had been lost to the stage in Dodgewick.
He fairly blazed with virtuous indignation.
Pointing to a chair, he said in his sternest tones,
“ Well, if you don’t want me to screen you any
longer, sit down and tell these people what you’ve
just been telling me ! ”
But I revolted. I wasn’t going to sit there and
put a firestick to my reputation to save twenty
Dodgewicks. I folded my arms and said in a loud
voice that I’d be d—d if I would.
“Then Til tell them!” he shouted, indig-
nantly, and he commenced forthwith.
I had always known that Dodgewick was a liar,
but as soon as he was fairly started, I recognised
that he was an inspired one. With burning elo-
quence and passionate reproaches he explained
how it was he’d been mistaken for me. (I can’t
remember how he did it, but it sounded quite
feasible while he was talking.) He told, with
sobs, how I had borrowed large sums of money
from him, and how he had invoked the aid of Miss
Latitude —for whom I had a very great regard—
to save me from ruin.
At this stage I turned and begged Lottie
to tell the lawyer and Mrs. Dodgewick that
Dodgewick was telling lies. I nearly fell
off my chair with astonishment and rage
when, instead of supporting me, she gazed
reproachfully at me and faltered, “Oh, Kid, do
let us be honest with them ! We have nothing to
be ashamed of, dear ! Let Mr. Dodgewick tell
Mr. Gadgestack the whole story, and then per-
haps Mrs. Dodgewick will be satisfied that there
is nothing in these horrid tales ! ”
Before I could get my breath, the lawyer cast a
contemptuous look in my direction and said, “I
think Miss Latitude’s suggestion is a very wise
one, and that you had better let Mr. Dodgewick
tell’us the whole truth.”
I opened my mouth to reply, but Mrs. Dodge-
wick burst into tears and wailed that “ she knew
all the time I was keeping something back.”
I would have given all the wealth I pos-
sessed in the world and whatever prospects I
had in the next to have been allowed to shout
out the true facts of the case. But they wouldn’t
have listened to me. At that stage of the pro-
ceedings, and in that atmosphere of outraged
virtue, the true facts would have appeared merely
as a tissue of fantastic lies. Some such thought
struck me even as I reeled under the blow. I
gave one despairing look at Dodgewick, swollen
with wrath and indignation, and resigned myself
to the inevitable. From that on I let him say
what he liked, without interruption of any kind ;
in fact, I fell into a sort of waking trance, in
which Dodgewick was merely a remote noise. I
knew that he was tearing my character to shreds
and scattering it to the four winds, but was it not
a useless encumbrance? Hadn’t he told me so
himself ? Even supposing the thing was of any
use, what right had I to object if Dodgewick de-
cided its sacrifice was necessary ? What was my
mission in life? Wasn’t it to serve Dodgewick?
What use was it fighting against Fate ? None, of
course ! Then, of course, for me Dodgewick was
Fate ; so it was no use fighting against Dodgewick.
He annihilated opposition ; he defied the laws of
financial gravity, and borrowed money from all
sorts of impossible people. Virtue shrank to one
side whenever he passed, and Truth fled before
him. What use was it resisting ? None what-
ever ! I decided not to struggle any more, and
sank like a stone in a sea of thought.
* * * *
When I awoke the lawyer was clearing his
throat and Mrs. Dodgewick was alternately sob-
bing and exclaiming: “Oh, I never could have
believed it ! I never— never could have believed
it! ”
I jumped to my feet and shouted, desperately,
“ Well, don’t believe it ! It’s all lies ! ”
She dabbed her sodden wisp of handkerchief to
her eyes and wailed, “Oh, how dare you address
me ! ”
Dodgewick, from behind, commanded me to
“Sit down !” and the lawyer remarked furiously
that I was “ going on like a madman.”
Lottie looked at me with beseeching eyes, and
said. “Oh, Kid, do try and control yourself.”
“ Control myself !” I yelled. “Why should I
control myself?”
“ Because,” shouted the lawyer, pounding the
desk, “ because you’re supposed to be a civilised
gentleman, and not a savage. Bad as your con-
duct has been in the past, you are making things
a thousand times worse by your insulting conduct.
Remember where you are, sir ! Remember where
you are ! ”
Dodgewick said, in a voice like a bull, “Sit
down, Johnson ! ”
I sat down.
Then they resumed, the lawyer leading off.
“Mrs. Dodgewick, am I correct in assuming
that you regard Mr. Dodgewick’s explanation as
satisfactory ? ”
“ Oh, yes—yes ! I was a wicked, foolish woman
ever to doubt him ! ”
“Ah-h!” the solicitor sighed with evident
relief. “Then I take it that the matter is to be
allowed to drop here ? ”
“Yes, indeed !. . . Oh ! William !” (Sobs.)
Dodgewick shuffled his feet and made no reply.
Mrs. Dodgewick rose slowly, still sobbing, and
requested to be taken home at once. Dodgewick
—without a word or a look—brushed past me and
offered her his arm. Distraught as I was, I
noticed that he did it awkwardly. His pose was
angular and uncertain, and had no suggestion of
ease or grace about it. Probably he had not given
her his arm in many years. They trailed out
together, looking miserable enough, and the lawyer
held the door and stared after them with an odd
expression.
Then there was silence for a minute while he
came back to his desk and fiddled with piles of
papers. I was staring moodily at his white
nervous hands moving restlessly amongst the
tape-bound documents, and wondering what poor
devils were paying for them, when a miserable
damp sniff in the corner reminded me of Lottie.
I roused myself and remarked in a lifeless sort
of way, “ May I get a cab for you ? ”
She stood up, sniffed again, and pulled down
her veil over her face. Then I offered her my
arm and we went out, the lawyer again holding
the door open. Half-way down the passage a
sudden thought struck me, and I looked back over
my shoulder. He was regarding us with the same
inscrutable look. It had a shade of malignancy
in it.
Outside we found a cab. “Found” is the
proper expression, because we didn’t “ call” it—it
wasn’t the sort of cab anyone would call. The
horse was an utter ruin, and the vehicle itself,
under ordinary circumstances, would have been
preposterous. Just then it suited our mood, and
we climbed in and told the driver—who was an
evil-looking man with red hair and a crooked eye
—to drive to Angelotanko’s oyster saloon. He
unwound the reins and jabbed the ruin with his
whip, and the thing woke up and staggered away
in front of us.
Then I asked Lottie what she meant by her
conduct, and she laid her hand on my arm and
said, “Oh ! Kid, we had to save him, you know !
We couldn’t sit there and let that jealous wretch
of a wife of his ruin the poor boy’s life, could we?
Think of all he's done for us !” .
I was too limp to get in a rage, or curse, or be
astonished. I just sighed, “ What has he done
for us?”
Her answer was an essentially feminine one.
She replied, “Well Kid, I’m sure he always took
the greatest interest in you , and he used to give
me —oh, such lots of good advice ! Then, too, he
was always so kind and sympathetic ! I never met
such a sympathetic man in all my life —and I’ve
been in some of the best hotels in Australia.”
I let it go at that. Outside, the decayed horse
fell about in the shafts in an aimless, senile
fashion, and wagged his ears at the traffic. The
mannerism irritated me and I was on the point
of complaining to the cabman about it when an
enormous constable seized the absurd thing by the
head, and made it stop rocking itself to sleep, or
whatever it was doing. The evil-looking man
with the red hair got in a most fearful passion,
and he and the policeman engaged in a long,
stupid argument. I stood it as long as I could,
and then I helped Lottie to get out, and we made
through the crowd and walked down the street to
Angelotanko’s.
We went upstairs, and I ordered oysters for two.
When they came, we set-to and ate them in per-
fect silence —at least, I ate in silence. Every now
and then Lottie sobbed, and told me that I was
“a dear, good Kid” for making such a sacrifice,
but that I must remember all that Willie (she
called him Willie) had done for me, and that I
owed it to him !
I said nothing, but, when my oysters were
eaten, and the twelve shells lay empty and
desolate on my plate, I threw my serviette on the
dirty floor and stared up at the fly-spotted ceiling,
that hadn’t been painted since God-knows-when.
In the stillness, I imagined I heard a faint echo
of some distant commotion, and the whim took me
to go to the window and look out.
Far down the street, under the big are lamps, was
a small, black crowd. In the centre was a cab and
a horse, and close by a red-headed man was dancing
with a policeman, and pointing excitedly at an
oyster-shop I never go to on the opposite side of
the street.
I thought there must be a fire, or that they were
both mad, until I recognised the red-headed man
as the driver.
Then I remembered I hadn’t paid him.

DON’T HESITATE
when the moment arrives for immediate action. It is then that
“ the man who hesitates is lost.” Investigate. Decide. Act.
These are the phases of every enterprise that is to have a
successful issue. In a world where there is so.much that is
doubtful—which is so full of snares to catch the unwary
where you can so easily be robbed of wealth or health, it is
most unwise
TO PUT YOUR FAITH IN
any proposition without careful investigation. Supposing, for
instance, you feel run down, “out of sorts,” worried, sickly, or
depressed, you know well enough that you ought to take some
curative and tonic medicine. If you will inquire, you will then
learn, perhaps from one of your own friends, that in
PIUS
you have, ready to your hand, a positive cure for such com-
plaints as indigestion, constipation, all forms of biliousness,
and other disorders of the liver and kidneys, which, when
neglected, give rise to serious complications and injuriously
react upon the nervous system, making life a veritable misery.
Beecham’s Pills are a reliable medicine, which have attained
their present high popularity by sheer merit, and if you give
them a chance they will keep you in perfect health. You will
then realise the truth of the saying—

Arrives get ready for it.
The first and best move is to instal a reliable
Windmill, the larger the better, as it pays to
have a little over than not enough.
Get a Windmill, an easy-running one, with a
bearing on each side of the windwheel,
strongly built, having a large sail area, and a
simple balance gear (to take the weight of the
Eump rod, and prevent the J mill locking at the
ottom of the stroke).
Above all, avoid the Windmill with cog-
wheels, back gears and wind-jamming brakes.

eradication of prickly pear had been recently carried
out on the Scone temporary common under the
supervision of the Government Botanist. The ex-
periments included spraying by means of a Tyree
machine with arsenical solution of varying strengths
on different plots of land in the same locality. The
solutions were also injected into the top parts of the
plants and into the bulbs below ground. Where the
bulbs were treated it was found that the plants died.”
