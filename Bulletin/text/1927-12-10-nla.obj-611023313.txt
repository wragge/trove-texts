The Red Page
Australia
I.
WITH sad red hands the n'orther
ages died.
The nations, in a brotherhood o:
tears,
Tore kinship with the talons of their prid
Their tales of blood were landmarks o
the years;
And the long trumpets raged about the
ears,
Calling the vanquished from their fielc
again
To hard steel triumphs and the bitter chee
For barren retribution bought with pai
And ever Hope sat weeping in the dark;
But she was fairer than the dawning hil
When the white star lies like a fioatin
spark
On the musk-yellow of a light that spi!
Along the east, while night’s black thundci
mills
Grind in the clouded west the storm ou
blown.
Hope wept; but saw beyond the traitor il
The future singing on a silver throne.
Blown drifts of elfin music up the shore,
Like broken flakes of foam before tli
breeze,
Fell echo-sweet about the western door
Of men who gazed heart-open to the sea
They heard; they wondered. All gaun
mysteries
Crowded in spectral lights along the tide
What callings of a wizard harp w,ere there
W hat dreaming voice of lone Adventure
bride!
11.
LIKE swallow wings that follow summe
home,
Not knowing where her golden ligh
shall stay,
Their sails were spread, they gave to wine
and foam
A trembling trust that bore them fa
away.
League by slow league they found grea
lands that lay
By long warm seas where thronging citie
stqamed
And cloud-roofed peaks above blue bigh
and bay
Were sentinels of plains where harvest
gleamed.
Thereafter, in the sea-ways of the North,
Adventure dreamt of rubies and heapec
gold—
Gold for the iron of its faring forth
And rubies for the blood it could not hole
From the high smoking lust of manifold
Disaster in the path of wind and wave
Touched by the magic of a story told,
The sea became a bounty and a grave.
Asia and Africa the Spanish Main....
The seas half-dreamed beyond the utmos
land....
The land half-seen at sea and lost again..
Slow caravans on measureless pale
sand....
The misty El Dorado, mountain-
spanned ....
Blood-mottled charts where dagger-points
bad shown
The hidden sjlver-inines! Each eager hanc
Grasped with desire of all rich spoils un-
known.
Blood, piracy, black slaves! And then the
calm
Of strange things well discovered! Sobei
trade
Steered a straight course by isles of spice
■ and palm;
And the long glamor breathless wondei
made,
•Tarnished with common knowledge, seemec
to fade
Into brown merchant ledgers—a mere
name.
Men gathered Asian gold and unafraid
Saw the blood-ruby sparkle into flame
Coldly the teeming cities of the North
the hard bread of bitter circumstance
The world forgot its valorous tarings forth
Along the wild sea-path of bold romance;
The wider vistas narrowed to a glance
At charted realms. But war-horns blow-
ing still
The pride of England or the boast of France
With clamorous discord swayed the
peoples’ will.
Too crowded were the ways for that full
breath
That fires the pulses to the triumph song
Of life exultant over time and death.
The feet of thousands set the music
;
The §cho-vpices of the past too long
©ripd in the heart that felt the spectral
y^firs
Chill with their clammy wisdom. Yet the
strong,
Fair face of Hope was sweet amid her
tears.
There came a grey ship sailing from the
east,
One lonely keel upon a waste of sea,
To this brown shore that seemed the last
and least,
The place of desolation’s empery.
Sere was no violet mist of memory,
No flaunting city reeking of the spoil;
But earth and wind and the good sun were
free,
Crying a welcome to the sons of toil.
No wonder shook the nations at the word
Of new-discovered coast and shining land.
Only with lifted face some dreamer heard
A distant song his heart could understand,
Breathing a vision of broad forests fanned
By sweet warm winds, with room and space
for all
The splendid labor of an eager hand—
Thus softly did the voice of Freedom call.
111.
LET the great seas be thanked through
all their tides
For wind-swept distance and the
watery fear
That like the benison of God divides
This summer from the wintry northern
year.
Not for the pilgrim who shall sojourn here
The easy road of swift and safe retreat—
Here lies the way of exile lone and clear,
The long home path beneath the wan-
derer’s feet.
His home was in the forests of his choice
Who dared the parting of all thoughts
and ways.
To him who saw the vision, heard the voice
Of lone Australia all her nights and days
Were as the rising tide that softly sways
Beneath the ample magic of the mo,on.
The future drew him upward; no cold praise
Of the dead ages seemed a living boon.
The ancient land of narrow hedge and wall,
Filled well to the last verge of brook and
wood,
Seemed to his dreaming eyes too cramped
and small
To hold for wider years the greater good.
Though blood had dyed its furrows rood by
rood.
He recked not of the sport of mouldered
kings;
A thousand leagues beyond him where he
stood
Lay green with promise of the bloodless
springs.
Royal he felt in pulse and might of will
Who saw vast realms that toil might con-
quer spread
Far on before from shining hill to hill.
Broad summer plain to virgin woodland
■wed,
A thousand forests singing o’er his head
The wild sweet hymns of Freedom’s con-
tinent ;
He could not heed the voices of the dead,
Himself a living king with power unspent.
Who shall despise the day of little things?
The crash of mighty hammers shakes the
earth,
The sky is thridded with,mechanic wings,
Each hour a new invention springs to
birth,
Each flying moment round the world’s huge
girth
The circling spark shrills loud the might
of man.
Shall we forget for these the shining worth
Of that true axe with which the work be-
gan?
The great day is the day of clearer sight.
From many a Pisgah o’er this promised
land
Men’s dreaming eyes saw far in holier light
The bridges of the rainbow. High hearts
planned
Conquests no Roman eagle could command,
Nor Macedonian phalanx edged with fire
Of him whose will was a Promethean wand
To lighten Asia to the West’s desire.
For deeds that shake the world a trumpet
brays.
But they who build the shaken world
anew
Seek no loud herald to proclaim their praise.
As in those temple walls that softly grew
To sacred silence in a people’s view,
Deeds garbed in modest quiet are for
them
Who know the white Shekinah shining
through
The shadows of their heart’s Jerusalem.
But where m ail the years was match for
one
Who stood at dawn and heard the mag r
pie trill
To the first lightning glitter of the sun;
And, looking westward o’er the bright-
’niug hill,
Felt alt his heart upon a sudden fill
With prayer and praise to hear his axe-
strokes falling,
The first full voice of a new nation’s wi11...
A thousand homes >,a. thousand years were
calling I
The marching ligmes, whose drums are
childfen’s voices,
Whose banners are the camp-fire’s rising
smoke,
Whose trophies are the brown field that
rejoices,
The new-split rail, the oxen in the yoke,
These at a thought through mountain val-
leys broke;
And far and far the red roads in the green
Were marked in conquered miles for quiet
folk
Who reaped the harvest that their dreams
had seen
The cypress, warm with life in summer light,
Grew by the homestead walls and rough-
hewn gate;
The roses nodded to the blue wren’s flight;
The lyre-bird mimicked human sounds
where late
The kookaburra and his laughing mate
Were loudest revellers in the wilderness.
Over the corn the great sun walked in state
And the good rain came by to soothe
and bless.
But vast grey sorrows went by greenest
ways;
For peace in victory has many tears.
A shadowed loneliness of nights and days
W as heart-companion of the toiling years.
Weakening of firm resolve and hard-eyed
fears
And weariness that dared not seek for rest
And sounds of other voices in sad ears
Cried at the wheels that 'sought the far-
ther west.
Not for these paused the seekers of the
. dream.
Beyond the limit of the last home fire
Were plains and mountains and the calling
gleam
Of rivers and broad fields of new desire.
Behind, the feet might lag, the spirits tire,
The Jips grow silent in the solitude;
But marching hearts of men could still
aspire
To lonelier deeds and find the promise
good.
The Reasons, bland as love to beauty’s
youth,
. r . (jrc ' v harsh and sullen as an aged shame
wU' VeS *' oo hing in the despite of truth
While bitter lips speak curses on its name.
Days dark with smoke, the vanguard of
fierce flame,
Bound in a wind the sapless north made
wild;
sun ’ a sc blood and doom, became
Ihe torment of a land with death defiled.
horror of the burning came and went.
Ihe black trail passing scarce a league
away
Told where men fought in red despair and
bent
The raging evil from its quivering prey.
But still the hot sun ruled the drooping day
Until the day hecame a haggard year;
And the dry torture had no more to slay
Where grass was dust and hearts out-
ached their fear.
IV.
TIME, servant to the courage that en-
dures,
0 ermastered, ill by ill, each season’s
mood.
Labor and rich brown earth had countless
cures
For him who fought so well and still
withstood
The ruin that in some brief triumph rude
Could fill the boldest thought with primal
fears.
Flood, drought and fire! And yet the land
was good
With mother sweetness in the crowning
years!
What word shall here be said of praise or
blame?
They saw, they hoped, they triumphed at
the last.
Write this above the true home-dreamer’s
name:
“He made the future holier than the
past.”
But what of her whose lot with his was
cast—
The woman who should mother all his
race?
What dreams were hers at twilight when the
' vast
Tree-shadowed silence gazed upon her
face?
The woman heart beats nearer to the soil;
Her roots strike deeper in the memoried
ground.
What she endured of loneliness and toil—
Fears for the day, the morrow, the dull
round
Of household tasks within the narrow
bound
Of one small home in the great wilder-
ness—
No story stands, save that great record
found
In a sweet memory that her children
bless.
How swiftly in the clear bright march of
days
The children’s voices shouted down the
dead—
The dead who cried from graves set far
away
Under the beech and elm whose leaves
were shed
In all too iiarrow spacer Born and wed
And buried ip one village, spn and sire!
And now the strong grandchildiien’s souls
were bred
To spaces ampler than a king’s desire.
They dived in rocky pools, they galloped
far
In the green places of the grass -and trees,
They learned strange lore under high sun
and star,
Fearless they climbed the mountain’s
leafy knees.
The yellow summer and the flying breeze
Were mates of playtime—and the world
was play—
For stalwart kin of all free things we
these,
Born to the laughter that is truth mac
gay.
If there was recklessness in that gooc
laughter,
Hold their great reckless brother Sun
blame.
Perchance be sinewed limbs for pride hei
after
Who lit their wildest gallop with h
flame.
Ask of the trumpets that have blown the
fame
About the high winds of the circling se
Shall that true sun who loved them sink
shame
For deeds they wrought on far Gallipol
Who hears Australia in the cry of cities?
Who knows Australia in the bales o
trade ?
A thousand ages weep a thousand pities
For the pent streets that make nqw yea
afraid.
Australia lives where her true homes ai
made;
For homes, not houses, all the ages wait
In dreams of home were her foundation
laid;
Only her marching homes shall make lie
great.
Here bold adventure came with eager fac
And hopes high-tuned to the stark wore
of gold.
More valiant were the stalwarts in tha
race
For sudden wealth than iron knights o
old.
Surely of these the half has not been told
They broke the valley and they piercec
the hill;
And when the prize was theirs to have anc
hold
They looked beyond for triumphs greatei
still.
For when they saw the wealth of dreams
that shone
With each day’s sun across a continent
The tented host divided and moved on,
Still valorous with hope and ill content.
A thousand landmarks show the way they
went;
Their names are written deep in fallowed
loam.
They came for gold, but all their thoughts
were bent
Beyond that paler gleam to dreams of
home.
Turn all the wheels. Let there be whirring
spindles;
And with the crash of batteries shout the
praise
Of mines and moving industry that kindles
The pride of Freedom, mistress of her
ways—
Maker of all things. Let new seekers blaze
New tracks in the wide forest of new
thought
And find new valleys where the richer days
Shall frame a common good of all they
sought.
But, in the triumph of all mind and wheels,
Shall the first dream of Freedom pass us
by?
Dust of the ancient world is at our heels;
The broken chains and rusted round us
lie;
And, as the good blue smoke goes up the
.sky,
Beside the altar of our trust we stand
And swear again the purpose shall not die
That drew the exiles to this holy land.
Our dreams are infinite as time and space,
Outreaching stars and systems and the
gleam
Of Knowledge, with the lamplight on her
face,
Who draws each rainbow truth from the
dark stream
In nets of corded reason. The first beam
Of morning on the mountains, dewy, tense
With waiting life, is like our hope that
deems
The centre sways the whole circumference
V.
THERE is a cottage on a royal sweep
Of ancient hills girt all about with
trees,
Green orange groves above it ever keep
A scented sweetness tremulous with bees.
The father takes the babe upon his knees
And looks across the yellowing of corn
To far horizons, while a little breeze
Out of the dimpling of the grass is born.
The mother sets an arm about the twain;
And in her eyes is distance greater still.
The height of vision tender love can gain
When all dear simple things with light
a-thrill
Lie in the green caress of one kind hill.
Imperial Freedom in her sky-wide dome
Finds here the centre of her conquering
wall—
Her brows high in the stars, her heart at
home.
Oh, priesthood of the faith that loves and
grows
Beyond all faith by labor of strong hands,
The sacrifice is laid, the altar glows,
The shrine is Mecca to the pilgrim lands!
Blessed is he who toils and understands
The purpose of his spirit to be free!
Australia of the morning lives and stands
By her twin watchwords—labor, liberty!

Most fitting of all is the gift musical —the gift
of lifetime use, lifetime pleasure and lifetime
remembrance.
The melody in your heart on Xmas morn may
re-echo in the heart and home of some loved one
through your sapient choice of a musical instru-
ment from the House of Suttons.
Here, from the sublime to the humorous, are
to be found the glorious Cable reproducing
piano, and —in another department —the mirth-
ful Ka%oo !
Somewhere between these two limits lies the
ideal musical gift —of lifetime use .
Our whole organisation is at your service with
melodious suggestion and harmonious advice.
Call or write this week and make that
Christmas choice .

The Westinghouse Light and Power Plant
is easy to own and extremely simple to
operate. It completely does away with
the old-fashioned oil and gas lighting, and
the source of power not only provides the
cheer of bright, safe lighting, but proves
invaluable as a lessener of everyday
drudgery for washing, ironing, cleaning,
cooking and refrigeration.
The installation of the Westinghouse
Plant brings city advantages within the
reach of the farmer for lighting inside and
outside, and dozens of operations pre-
viously almost exclusive to townsfolk.
Cut out the coupon below, mail it, and
let us show you how easy it is to own a

ADAM AND EVE.—“GIB IT A BITE!"


At the Meadows.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I IFE is now no more a splendor,
■*—‘ As in early days it was,
At the Meadows, when the shadows
Crept across the barley-grass:
Since youth carolled, joy-apparelled,
Time has turned and turned his glass!
Memory is a magic thing
Potent as a fairy,
Back it brings them once again—
Rose and Maud and Mary,
Merry Ellen at her work,
Singing in the dairy.
Life is now no more a glory,
As it was in early days
At the Meadows, when the shadows
Cooled the forest-greens and greys,
And youth squandered bliss and wandered
Down the wild, enchanted ways.
Memory has the limner's art,
Paihting pictures rosy:
Maud and Mary both were dark,
Ellen coy and cosy,
Rose’s hair was angel-gold—
Sweet the girlhoo' 1 posy.
Life is now no more a spendthrift,
As it was on evenings fled
At the Meadows, when the shadows
Touched the saplings, green
and red;
And the drovers and the rovers
Welcome were to board and
bed.
Memory has a treasure-room,
Hoarding more than money;
Maud and Mary set the plates,
Ellen, bright and sunny,
Brought the bread and roasted
meats,
Rose the cream and honey.
Life is now no longer tinted
As in early days gone by
At the Meadows, when the
shadows
Creeping nigh, and yet more
nigh,
Wake tlie thrushes in the
bushes
And the swallows in the sky.
Memory has the dancer’s tricks,
Timing every measure;
Maud and Mary romped and
raced,
Mixing mirth and leisure;
Rose and Ellen danced a jig,
Filling night with pleasure.
Life is now no more a revel,
As it was in days of yore
At the Meadows, for the
shadows
Darken it from roof to floor;
And though laughter rise here-
after,
What has been shall be no
more.
Memory ! Where has Pleasure
sped,
Wholesome, sweet and airy?
Silent is the shadowed house,
Songless is the dairy.
Where have Maud and Ellen
gone ?
Where are Rose and Mary?

Commemoration.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
¥T was on a blazing afternoon
Jj of midsummer when I
heard this story, and it is
a necessary explanation of its
title to mention that the par-
ticular day was the 13th of Feb-
ruary.
On Commemoration Day all the
green playing-fields of the beau-
tiful park at The King’s School
arc speckled with white by flan-
nel-clad schoolboys and a
variety of men who once were
schoolboys, also. The first XI
plays the pick of the more recent
veterans, and other teams of a
lower grade meet, too; but the
most popular match for the
spectators is that between more
or less unathletic “sports” of
over 45 years and the diminu-
tive youths of twelve and down-
wards, who dwell in Governor Macquarie’s old
mansion on the hill across the river from the
school-house which Governor Phillip named
after Mr. Under-Secretary Rose, of H. M.
Treasury, when he first established an out-
post at Parramatta in 17SS. It is in this
contest that the Past and Present of the
school are brought most strikingly in contrast
—when 1875-95 disports itself flippantly
with the strenuous and serious-minded
juniors of this Year of Grace, who make up
in dignity, deportment and costume all that
is lacking of such things in their seniors.
We sat on a bench beneath a pine-tree,
not far below the remains of Sir Thomas
Brisbane’s observatory, and watched Youth
and Age contending in the shadow of the
old Georgian vice-regal residence. Peter
Mitclielmore is as cheerful a companion at
an Old Boys’ cricket-match as lie is in the
board-room of Mitclielmore and Company,
on the deck of his yacht in Broken Bay or
anywhere else. That wrinkled, sun-tanned,
humorous face, with its thatch of silver
hair and laughing, bright eyes, makes for
cheerfulness wherever it appears, and no
one can be in its owner’s company for even
a little while without realising that Life
and Death are merely good jokes. Ilis very
stout son was playing on the side of the
aged, and Peter found much delight in criti-
cising his son’s futile efforts to bowl a
flaxen infant whom bat and pads almost hid
from view.
“Well bowled, Jimmy.” he chuckled. “Oh,
well bowled ! That’s the stuff to give ’em.
Don't let him make his century. Well,
now"—in affected disgust—-“what do you
think about that? Dick’s going to change
the bowling. Doesn't give my bright lad
a chance. Poor little Jimmy!”
Peter Mitchelmore has had many
adventures, and doesn’t mind telling them;
so when he suggested that we should take
a stroll round the park, I hastened to signify
my willingness, hoping that one of his old
tales might be the outcome of it. We walked
round the higher bank of the tree-shaded
river, and presently, grumbling at the heat,
he subsided on to a seat near the Upper
Dam, and I sat down beside him. There I
got the story of the second-lieutenant of
11.M.5. Tortoise and Supercargo Mitchel-
more. The sun was low over Toongabbie
behind us before he finished tolling it, and
we went over to the school-house for tea.
“Do you know,” he said, “I’ve been think-
ing that it’s just about fifty-five years since
I first came to Commemoration as an Old
Boy. That was in ’72, and I’ve not been
at a great many since. The year after I
left school—Lord, it only seems the day
before yesterday! But I remember it well
enough—my word! And another one five
years afterwards, though it wasn’t held here.
It was celebrated in the Solomons. Stay
here and I’ll tell you all about it. It’s
damnably hot!
“Watching those little chaps at Old Gov-
ernment House reminded me of Charley Nott
—you’ll remember him by name, no doubt,
lie died a rear-admiral in the navy—not
QUITE.
“What are you doing here, Ronnie?”
“Looking for a wife!”
“What! Isn’t one enough?”
“Quite! It’s the one I’m looking for.”
so many years ago—-but when I knew him
first he was a little, red-headed shaver twelve
years old, and my bitterest enemy. I was
twelve months older, but we were about
the same size and weight, and in the series
of fights that took place between us during
the year that lie remained at the school—
before he left to join the navy—the honors
were pretty even. Sometimes ‘the Paddy-
melon’ —that was what he was called —-
would win, and sometimes ‘Spadger’—that
was me. But we hated one another like
poison, and were always perfectly willing
to oblige the rest of the fellows with a mill.
“I’m not quite sure to this day why we
disliked each other so much, and don’t think,
really, that it was for any better reason
than that the big fellows egged us on. I
was induced to insult his father by calling
him a ‘lobster,’ and saying that he was only
a tin soldier, and they had persuaded him
to state that my mother had been the daugh-
ter of an old ‘lag.’ These were terrible
and unforgivable slanders, when you come
to consider that Colonel Nott had won the
y.C. at the Gate Pa. and that my maternal
grandfather was old Commissary-General
Carron, who had been a tremendous social
gun in Sydney in the ’fifties, and was
regarded in our family as being but very
slightly less important than God Almighty.
Fearful things to say !
“Paddymelon's father was in command of
one of the regiments of the .garrison, just
before the Imperial troops were removed
from Australia, and had sold out and settled
down in Sydney, and mine, as I daresay
you know, was one of the leading merchants
of the place, with interests in the Islands
that were almost equal to those of Bobby
Towns himself. They were very good friends,
but that made no difference to us. We agreed
on only one point—mutual dislike to one
another.
“Well, Charley Nott was taken away from
school when he was between thirteen and
fourteen years old, and sent to England to
become a midshipman, whilst I remained
here until I was in my eighteenth year, and
then went into my father’s business—the
Island side of it. That was in ’7l, and he
kept me in the Sydney office for a couple of
years to learn the ropes before he sent me
down to the Islands to look after things
there.
“Of course, I must come up here and
swagger round a bit on the First Commemora-
tion Day after I had left school —a grown-
up man with downy whiskers, sumptuously
clad in the ugly clothing of the period, and
smoking a large and expensive meerschaum
pipe. And 1 regret to say that I foregathered
with two or three roysterers of my own
calibre in the evening, at the old Woolpack,
and got very tight. So tight that I didn’t
remember in the morning how I came to
have a black eye. I was still at the Wool-
pack in the morning, lying fully dressed —
with the exception of a coat and boots —
on a bed in an upstairs room. There were
splashes of blood on my shirt-front, and
my nose was very sore and swollen. And
I had, as I've said, a very fine black eye.
I must have been fighting, but for the life
of me I couldn’t recall anything about it
all. It was my first bad head of the sort,
and I felt very miserable. Repentant. Bil-
lions. Unhappy.
“About ten o’clock, Tom Mullins, the land-
lord, came and knocked at the door, as I
was washing. I sang out to him to come in,
and he came, and grinned at me, and handed
me a note in a sealed envelope.
“ ‘A very pretty little go in it was, Mr.
Mitclielmore —while it lasted,’ says he. ‘lf
you hadn’t both been so full up, it’d lia’ been
a sin to interfere. But I couldn't help it.
Couldn’t afford to let you break more than
two chairs. You were neither of you too
sure on your pins, but you didn’t do so bad.
Not half bad.’
“‘What was the trouble, Tom?’ I asked
him. 'How did I get like this?’ .
“ ‘Oh, don’t you worry, sir,’ he says. ‘He i
got as good as what you have. Two teeth
knocked out, and both eyes bunged up. There
wasn’t much between you. A nice young
chap, that Lootenant Nott. A Kirigy, too,
but before my time. Belongs _to his
Majesty’s ship Bobadil, what’s sailing to-
day for England. Most particular sorry he
was, he told me, that lie couldn’t stay an
see some more of you this morning. He
had to clear out before breakfast. We done
what we could for him, wi’ a raw beefsteak
for his eyes, but he won’t be much of an
ornament to th’ sarvice for a day or two, lie
won’t. He asked me to give you this, sir.’
“‘Good Lord!’ I gasped. ‘Was it Charley
Nott —Paddymelon?’
“ ‘That’s what they all called him, Mr.
Mitchelmore. That’s him.’
“I asked Tom Mullins what had happened,
and it seemed that Paddymelon—-Charley
Nott—had come into the hotel at midnight,
after a hilarious evening somewhere else in
Parramatta, in the company of a brother
officer, and also after the last train to Sydney
had gone, looking for a bed. He’d been to
the school, too, but, somehow, we hadn’t seen
one another. However, we weren’t long in
doing so at the Woolpack, and it seems that
we went for one another, unanimously, as
soon as we did. It must have been a pretty
willing go while it lasted. Tom said we
abused each other like bullock-drivers on the
spree before we shaped up, and
that, for a row that started out
of nothing, so far as he was able
to make out, it was as good as
anything he’d ever seen.
“ ‘Th’ lootenant was very
upset this morning that he
couldn’t wait till you were up.’
Tom said. ‘But mebbe th' letter'll
tell you some more, sir. And
what about breakfast, Mr. Mit-
chelmore? Will I send you some-
thing up here?’
“I told him I didn’t want any
breakfast, and. when he went
away, opened Charley Nott’s let-
ter. Dear me, I remember every
word! It was short arid to the
point.
“ ‘Dear Mitchelmore,’ it went.
‘You are a damned swine, and
the next time I see you I’ll
knock your head off. —Yours
truly, Charles Jffott.’ ”
The old man chuckled as he
lit a cigar, and leaned back on
the bench, obviously in the full
enjoyment of a pleasant memory.
“Well?” I asked him, pre-
sently. “And what happened
when you did meet—l suppose
you came across one another
again sometime? Did he knock
your head off?” Mr. Mitchelmore
laughed outright.
“No,” he said. “As a matter
of fact, he prevented it from
being cut off. Funny, it was—
oh, damn funny! I’m not bor-
ing you?”
I assured him to the contrary.
“The next time I came across
Paddymelon was five years after-
wards, and it was as curious an
encounter as two people ever
had. In fact, it would have been
so damn curious for me, if we
hadn’t met, that I wouldn’t be
here now. And a rum thing
about it was that the meeting
took place on Commemoration
Day, February 13, 1877. I’m
not at all like to forget the date.
Just look at my neck, here —
under the left ear. You can see
a scar, can’t you?”
He leaned his head over to-
wards his right shoulder, and
above the rim of his collar I was
able to make out, under the ear,
and extending from the angle of
the jaw almost to the hack of
his neck, white against the
leathery skin, a jagged cicatrice
that, in its original condition,
must have . been a fearsome
wound indeed. It made one’s
flesh creep merely to look at it.
“You see how that particular
Commemoration Day’s been
underlined in my memory?” the
old man laughed. “A man
wouldn’t be likely to forget any
impressions that may have been
formed about the time and place
that little memento was acquired,
would he? Well, I haven’t.”
“Moses!” I said. “The chap
who did that must have meant
nothing else but decapitation!”
“Exactly. That’s what he did mean, and
came damn near accomplishing. I’ll tell
you.
"We had a station at a place called Matea
Bay, in Gaudalcanar, where a man named
German Fred had been in charge, and had
•died—mainly, as I learned when I went
there to inquire into his disease, on account
of having come to regard trade gin as the
only reliable antidote for malaria. I found
the place in occupation by the natives when
I called there, on my rounds, in our schooner,
the Anne Mitclielmore —named after my
mother —and all that was to be gathered as
to Fred Hoffman’s end was that he was
‘altogether finish,’ and that his body had been
deposited on the outer edge of the reef that
fringes the bay. So I took one of my boys
from the Anne —a Gilbert Islander, whom
we called Stinking Jimmy—and went ashore
to stop there until the schooner came back
from the western end of the Solomons, in
order to re-organise the trade and straighten
things up generally, giving orders that an-
other chap should be brought back from a
bigger station we had in the island of
Florida to take charge at Matea Bay. So
off sailed the Anne, and I was left alone
there w T itli Stinking Jimmy, one of the best
chaps I’ve ever come across, black or white.
“The natives round those parts were
pretty amiable if they were let alone, and
had welcomed the establishment of the trad-
ing-station as some sort of a guarantee of
protection by the white fellers against the
sanguinary raids of head hunting expeditions


that occasionally afflicted the communities
along those coasts, from Vella Lavella or
New Georgia. We never had any trouble
with tli.em, and German Fred had built up
quite a good business, and run it very well
until the Square Face had got the best of
him. There’d been some looting of the store
when he pegged out —as was only to be
STILL AT IT.
MR. BUNNY: “What’s happened to that con-
ceited Cottontail fellow?”
MR. BUCKTOOTH : “Last I heard of him he
was down at the summer boarding-
house passing himself off as curried
chicken.”
expected—but the buildings were undamaged,
and I was soon able to get the establishment
going again, just as good as ever.
“To tell you the truth, I had rather wel-
comed that spell ashore, which was pro-
bably to last for six or seven weeks—for
one thing because I was sick of cruising
about in the Anne, and, for another, because
it seemed a good chance to do a bit of re-
cruiting for a plantation we had in Fiji,
near Suva, where we were badly in want of
labor. This lot of people about Matea Bay
hadn’t been much interfered with by the
Queensland blackbirders, and were a decent
lot, taken all round, who were willing enough
to become acquainted with a wider world
than Gaudalcanar, and not altogether work-
shy. German Fred’s house was quite a good
one, and he had left behind a well-stocked
library of mostly English books which would
help to pass the time. I settled down there
for a jolly good loaf, until the Anne Mitchel-
more should again drop her mudhook outside
the reef that made the bay into as pretty
a little lagoon as you’d see anywhere. And
the change of grub and opportunity for
exercise, to say nothing of the possibilities
of shooting and fishing, was just what I
wanted.
“Things went along quietly for about a
month, and I was enjoying myself first-rate
—loafing and reading, and doing a bit of
fishing or shooting whenever I wanted
NO OVERTIME.
THE Boss: “Well, aren’t you going to kiss me good night?”
THE TYPIST: “Have sense—it struck five nearly three minutes ago.”
variety—and the trade was coming in nicely.
Stinking Jimmy was a top-notch cook —that
was partly why I’d taken him out of the
crew of the Anne to keep me company. He
was besides the jolliest boy I’ve ever come
across in the Islands, and one of the best-
looking. He had a body like a bronze
statue, and a fine, open face that was always
wreathed in smiles. Nothing ever put him
out or seemed too much trouble. Upon my
soul, I was almost beginning to think that
the life of a trader in charge of an isolated
station like Matea Bay was the ideal exist-
ence. Solitary and lonely? I got a notion
into my head that the grumbles and growls
of the fellows marooned in such places were
all bunkum. And then, without a moment s
warning, disaster came. Game with a rush,
and I found myself facing annihilation in as
sudden a fashion as could well be imagined.
A beastly sort of annihilation, too!
“One morning-—it was the 13th of Febru-
ary, and I hadn’t forgotten the old school,
and made up my mind to tell .Timmy to
hoist the flag on the pole in front of the
house, by way of keeping up Commemoration
Day—l was shaving in the house, when I
heard Jimmy jump on to the verandah, and
call out for me to come quick. I could tell
from liis voice that something had scared
him.
“ ‘Peetee, Peetee!’ 1 heard him sing out.
‘Chris’ sake bringen gun ! Bad feller plenty
stop along lagoon. Quick feller, Peetee —
quick feller”
“I dropped the shaving-brush, picked up
my Winchester, and ran out to him. And
then, I tell you, I was scared —damn scared.
“First of all, I took a look at the native
village, over to the left as you faced the
bay, and saw that it was utterly deserted.
There wasn’t even a mongrel dog or a pig
left about the grass huts. All the people
had cleared out —taken to the bush and the
mountains. When I looked down the slope
towards the opal-colored lagoon, and the blue
strip of sea outside the reef, I saw why.
“There were three big war-canoes just
inside the narrow entrance through the reef
by which boats might enter the lagoon—those
big black craft, with curled-up richly-orna-
mented ends, all decorated with skulls and
mother-o’-pearl inlaid in the black-painted
woodwork, that used to have such a sinister
reputation in the Solomons years ago. You
might have seen one of them in the Mel-
bourne Museum? The sight of those craft out-
side the lagoon was quite enough to scare
away all the inhabitants of any of the
coastal villages throughout the group. Head-
hunters they were—-forty to fifty of ’em in
each of the big canoes. By the Lord, they
had me galleyed as soon as ever I set eyes
on them !
“It was a hot, still morning, and the yells
of those devils echoed, back from the wooded
hills behind the house in a way would make
your blood curdle. They came tearing across
the glassy surface of the lagoon, churning
it up with their short paddles, at a pace
that was something like a racing eight’s—
straight for the strip of white coral beach
curving round the bay that lay immediately
below where Jimmy and I were gaping at
them with open mouths, not a quarter of a
mile above the little landing jetty for boats
that German Fred had built. I went down
on one knee, and took a snapshot at the
leading canoe. A fellow standing up in the
bows flourishing a tomahawk got it, and I
saw him topple over into the water. The
whole gang of them let out a fearful yell,
and seemed to make a long, narrow, graceful
craft fairly skim oyer the water —as much
like a hydroplane as anything I’ve ever seen.
“I pumped lead at them till the Win-
chester’s magazine was empty, and then yelled
to Stinking Jimmy to come inside. We piled
everything we could against the doors, back
and front —it was a one-roomed wooden
shack, with a palm-thatclied roof—and
blocked the two little windows up with
mattresses. We might stand them off for a
bit, I knew. There were two rifles, and we
had plenty of ammunition, but I was as cer-
tain as could be that there was only one
end to expect. A white man’s head was no
end of a treasure, and these swine wouldn’t
easily be put off capturing it. I felt my old
nut already wobbling a bit loose on my
shoulders, and caught myself wondering what
sort of an ornament it would make hanging
smoke-dried in some savage chief’s collection.
It didn’t feel comfortable at all, I can tell
you. I knew it was only a matter of an
hour or two before they had us. Well, the
only thing was to make ’em pay as stiff a
price as possible for the trophy.
“I watched them through the crack be-
tween the young tree-trunks, of which the
house’s walls were made, where I had poked
in the barrel of my rifle. We kept on firing
-—.Jimmy knew our desperate situation as well
as I did, and after his first bit of a scare
was as cool as any cucumber—and saw
several of them go down in the shallow
water and on the beach as they swarmed
out of the canoes. Then they came racing
and yelling un the grassy slope, and a few
more of ’em tumbled in beans and lay still,
or crawled down towards the beach. But
they weren’t checked for a moment. They
came stumbling up towards the house, and
circling round on our flanks, until I could
see their beastly
faces and the yel-
lows of their eyes.
It was then I
realised the ante-
mortem feelings of
cattle or pigs in
the slaughter-
house.
“Just when I
knew it was all up,
and not much more
than a matter of
minutes, I saw a
sight to seaward
that made my heart
thump up against
my ribs. Suddenly a
small ship slid into
the dark-blue strip
of sea between the
reef and the sky,
and I recognised
her immediately as
11.M.5. Tortoise,
the patrol-schooner
that the Commodore
kept cruising about
in the Western
Pacific, doing police
work. I sang out
to Jimmy, and saw
him grin. I have
never forgotten that
cheerful grin: his
face was still wear-
ing it when next 1
saw it, but pool 1
Jimmy's woolly
head wasn’t wear-
ing his body.
“Then two or
three of them
began to fire at the
house with Snyder
rifles. I could hear
the thumping, big
bullets plugging
into the saplings
in the walls. I’d
just realised that
impression when
out I went. One
of the bullets, I
gathered after-
wards, had glanced
off something or
other, and skidded
across the top of
my head only
just ploughing
through three inches
of scalp, but stun-
ning me quite
effectually. That was all, so far as I was
concerned, for quite a while.”
He paused as he threw the stump of his
cigar away, and stood up.
“Come on,” he said. “It's pretty near six
o’clock, and we’ll be late for tea. Oh yes,
I’ll tell you what happened as we walk
across.”
We crossed the river over the low cause-
way of the Upper Dam, and climbed up the
steep baifks shaded with big gum-trees, until
we reached the flat behind the Parramatta
District cricket-ground. He finished the story
as we walked across the green levels of the
old racecourse towards the school.
“It was about mid-day when I came to
and saw Paddymelon Nott, in a white duck
uniform, staring at me, as he sat on a box
near the door. I was lying on a mattress
on the floor, and a doctor-man was bathing
my head —with some disinfectant stuff, by
the smell of it.
“‘Hullo, he’s come to!’ says this chap.
‘Lie still, old man, lie still, damn you, or
your blessed head’ll fall off. By George,
Mister Man, you’ve been pretty close to
losing it. He’ll do, I think, Nott,’ he says.
‘Do you wish to talk to him?’
“The young, red-headed officer got up from
his box," and walked across the room. He
stood staring down at me.
“Presently he spoke.
“ ‘Are you an old boy of the King's
School?’ he asked me.
“ ‘Yes,’ I told him —pretty feebly.
“ ‘Spadger Mitchelmore?’ he says.
“ ‘Yes,’ I whispered. I was very thirsty
and dry.
“He burst out laughing.
“ ‘Well, I’ll be damned!’ he says. ‘What
do you think of that, Pills? I’ve been hoping
to meet this chap for five years so’s I could
knock his confounded head off. And now’ —
“ ‘l’m much obliged to you, Paddymelon,’
I croaked.”

NARDADU, grandmother of Munga, was

the red plains under blue sky. Singing,
in a low wandering undertone, like wind
coming from far over the plains at night:

in the offal of a dead beast. There had been
a kill the night before. A stench of blood
and filth flowed through the air about her.
On an old hide rotting in the sun, a little
lizard lay quite still. Nardadu plucked over
a length of entrail and set it aside. She
reached for another, grey-green and dark
with blood.
A small squat woman, with broad square
features, wide jawbone, short hair in greasy
strands packed with mud and bound by a
dirty white rag, she sat there singing and
picking over all that was left of the dead
bullock. A gina-gina, blue for a length,
almost black with dust and grease, showed
her bony legs and feet. Her face all placid
satisfaction, the black sticks of her arms and
fingers swung backwards and forwards, dis-
turbing flies. Flies clung at the sunken wells

of her eyes; but she plucked on over the mess
of blood and dung, singing :
“Be-be coon-doo-100, coon-doo-100,

Across a stretch of ironstone pebbles the
buildings of Nyedee homestead were clear
in the high light of early morning. There
were trees round the long white house with
Verandahs where John Gray slept and ate
with his women and children. Megga had
planted the trees long ago, the tall dark ones,
those bushes with curds of blossom, and the
kurrajongs whose leaves were light green and
fluttering just now.
Megga had ridden and worked with John
when he first camped by Nyedee well. Tall
and gaunt and hard, she had cooked in the
mustering and droving camps, driven men
and beasts through long dry seasons. Eh-erm,
she drove John. He was still her little
brother.
Half a mile away Nardadu could see every
plank and post of the verandah; white hens
stalking across it; harsh green of cabbages,
onions, turnips surging beside the big wind-
mill ; the mill, its wheel and long fine lines
ruled against the sky; and the little mill on
mulga posts with gauge stuck out like the
tail of a bird. Coonardoo and Minyi came
out from the house for water. Slight,
straight figures in dungaree gina-ginas, they
moved slowly to the little mill. But it was
out of order—would not give water except
in a high wind.
White hens scattered and flew before
Megga as she came along the verandah, Meet-
chie behind her, John after them both. A
shrill screaming and flow' of women’s voices
reached Nardadu; the throb and peeper re-
verberation of John’s voice, as*. he came
between the women, throwing a wwd or two
before him. Small and stiff as chalk draw-
ings her people had made on rocks in the
hills, John and the two women rocked and
moved with sharp little gestures before the
house.
Nardadu knew what it was all about. She
had heard that screaming and quarrelling of
women and the anger of John’s voice so often
before. She smiled to herself and went on
with her singing. Winding and rumbling
through her, on and on it went, the eerie,
remote melody. Nardadu remembered her
mother singing that song. It did not belong
to Nyedee people. Nardadu had brought it
with her to Nyedee from beyond those wild
tumbled hills which stood on the edge of the
plain north-east. Her mother had sung the
little song to Nardadu when she was a
cooboo. Nardadu had sung it to Beilba and
Munga. Always it came fluttering out of
her when she was pleased or afraid.
She was pleased this morning *o have found
something she could cook in the ashes of her
fire to satisfy the hunger of Munga when he
came in from the dogging. All the men of
the uloo had been out trapping dingoes while
John was away. But John was home again,

The Drink Before You Go.
by Oscar Wallers
[Foit The Bulletin.]
TI THEN you roll your blanket neatly, and
1/1/ you tighten up the straps,
And you’re jeeling too downhearted to
say good-bye to the chaps;
When the lonely track is stretching out as Jar as
you can see,
And you stand awhile and wonder what the end
of things will be,
You will jeel a little braver ij jrom some old
mate you know
Comes a cheerful invitation to a drink before
you go.
You may lose the love of woman that you
thought could never die,
Fame may never pause to greet you, Fortune pass
disdainful by;
Youth’s pictures will grow fainter, but there’s one
you’ll carry far—
The words in mateship spoken, the hand-grip in
the bar.
In this world of toil and trouble it’s a heavy debt
we owe
To the careless brave words spoken o’er the drink
before we go.
When the goats are on the left hand, and. the
sheep are on the right,
And the sins you thought forgotten are dragged
starkly to the light;
When you’re feeling not too clever, and you’re
trying to look game,
And you’re wondering what will happen when the
Usher calls your name,
With a brave step and a firmer you will take the
road below
If there’s someone there to stand you to a drink
before you go.


and the men would be in soon. The old. high,
four-wheeled, single-seated buggy in which
John had come from Ivarara station, with
Chitali and old Tommy, still stood red with
dust out before the shed. Horses which had
drawn the buggy, rough hair streaked and
matted with dust and sweat, were feeding
beneath the acacias and mulga, beyond the
stockyards.
The little windmill would be mended.
There would be the good smell of meat
roasted on ashes in the evening air down
by the uloo. When the men had eaten, talk
would be made of dingoes—of wild dogs
caught, or too cunning for any trap. Won-
gana would make a song about a dingo, click-
ing karlies beside his camp-fire. There would
be singing—-singing and sleeping in the
warm, starlit darkness.
On other stations Nardadu knew, men of
the camp would not have gone dogging and
left their women at the uloo. Wiali! A
curse threaded the words of her song. But
Nyedee was not like other places. John Gray
left the uloo to the ways of the uloo. He
did not drink the whisky babba until lie could
not walk; or lurch, rolling and shouting; or
take oif young gins from the uloo. Megga?
Eh-erm-—Nardadu guessed Megga was re-
sponsible for that. By her will it was John
did not drink whisky until bis legs would not
carry him ; or take a gin even when old men
of the camp sent her to him.
Nardadu did not understand how a woman
came to have such power with a man that
her will should be stronger than his. But
Megga-—Nardadu understood something of
her and her will, having lived so long with
her. Had she not made men of the uloo
even wear wandy-warra, and the women
grass and leaves from a string round their
waists, before there were gina-ginas or
trousers and boots on Nyedee? But tliat
John should come under her will so —John
who was a man of men! Nardadu clucked
and threw out her hands in the native
gesture of surprise.
Master he might be of all the country
which lay before her old brown eyes, from
the wedge of red and yellow purple-riven hills
along tlie west to those wild and tumbled
timbered ridges north and east; beyond which
stretched the country of her people and the
buck spinifex flats, away and away inland.
Yet John he was to her; John the all-
powerful to be sure, giver of food and cloth-
ing, whose anger and boot you avoided; but
who laughed and made fun with you. good-
humoredly, when all -went well with him.
She had come through the gorge of Nyedee
hills with him—how long ago? Nardadu
could not count beyond three. “Plenty years,”
she would say it was since John Gray had
first brought cattle through the gorge of Nye-
dee hills, over there where the great kood-
geeda’s eye made a pool of fresh drinking-
water. Trembling, she remembered the great
silver lidless eve in the shadow of dark rocks.
How it had flashed at her, glimmered from
beneath the water when she went down with
her jindie! They had camped quite near,
and Warieda. her man, had sent her down
to the pool for water because he said the
koodgeeda would not hurt a gin. He had
made her sleep on the side nearest the pool,
too. How terrified she had been —plenty
years ago. when she first came to Nyedee
with John Gray!
Warieda, her man, had been speared over
there on the range by one of her own people.
Warieda’s brother had claimed her. She
bad grown Beilba then; and Munga was
Beilba’s son. Her eyes wavered to the creek
gums and burying-ground of the uloo, railed
places and mounds covered with bark and
branches. Her voice had the shrill anguish
of wailing for her daughter.
Now she was an old Avoman, had bulyas
on her hands, and led the women’s singing in
the corroborees. She had no husband to con-
cern herself about, only Munga, her grandson,
who shared her low humpy of boughs and hide
—and the cows. Nardadu was cow-woman
on Nvedee, drove the milkers from their night
wandering on wide plains where the wind-
grass was yellow, and acacias, in their young
green, stood against hills, blue, blue as the
dungaree of a new gina-gina.
While coolwenda was putting his slow
melodious notes across the vast spaces of
hill and plain, and stars were still in the
sky, she went scurrying after the cows, and
brought them through the Two-mile gate to
the yards, red heifers and calves, a huge
white cow who charged whenever she got a
chance, and the old red bull, lumbering and
sulky. Nardadu ruled the cows. A drab
gnomish figure in dirty gina-gina and the old
felt hat which had been Warieda’s, she
shambled swiftly over the stones, banging two
tins to make the cows hurry; proud of her-
self, of being on the strength of the station,
old woman though she was, cow-tailer.
She had not been away since first she came
to Nyedee. She had never been pink-eye;
but then none of the Nyedee people went pink-
eye. Other tribes came to pink-eye on Nye-
dee every year. There were corroborees, and
youths for hundreds of miles about were
made men in the wide-spreading scrub of
mulga and minnericlii which spread to the
foot of the dog-toothed range.
The hut of mud-bricks, baked in the sun,
on the place where Nyedee homestead now
stood —Nardadu had helped to build that.
After its walls were up Megga had not ridden
out with the men. She had stayed at the
hut to watch the sinking of wells, raising
of windmills and stockyards. Every plank
w-as set under her eyes; the windmills, with
their great wheels and wedge tails of blue-
grey ii’on, stretched taut against the sky.
Then camels bringing stores and sheets of
ribbed iron had come over the creek! Again
and again they had come, the great beasts,
so savage and evil-smelling yet led by a
little stick through the nose and rope reins,
bringing more and more sheets of iron and
painted w r ood, flour, sugar, tea, gina-ginas,
trousers, boots and hats for the men w 7 ho
went riding with John, pipes, tobacco and
boiled lollies. Such days they w 7 ere, great
days of bustle and excitement, from the
first fluting of the butcher-bird before stars
paled in the eastern sky until the sun w T ent
away behind the back of the hills.
The first room of mud-bricks w 7 as kept for
a kitchen and the new house grew 7 out from
it. with verandahs, doors, wire cages for
rooms. Megga bad sent old men, women and
children from the uloo to gather white clay
in a creek bed miles away and had showed
them how' to pain' the bouse. But to Nar-
dadu it still seemed that the long white house
among trees had reared itself by magic on
the floor of the dead sea. Far out across
the plains she had seen a mirage lying across
it, reflections of a house in the sky, and had
sung her song as a movin against evil, any
evil magic could do an old woman by stealing
her wits when she was minding cows by her-
self, far away from her kin and the uloo of
her people.
Megga herself had worn white clothes when
the house was finished. The gins washed
them, hung them out to dry and pressed
them smooth with irons made hot in the fire.
She had gathered about herself, too, china
dishes and pots which broke when you
dropped them, bringing down Megga’s wrath
as nothing had ever done.
Then the chickens came. Small fluffy crea-
tures Megga had loved and tended until they
were neat white hens, which if a dog killed
—Eli-erm, there was hell to pay!
Nardadu remembered the killing of one of
those hens by Midgelerrie, her own dog, a
brindle kangaroo hound, as dear to her
almost as Munga. There was no better
hunter on Nyedee; but he had pounced on
and devoured one of those hens. Lowering,
Megga, she remembered, had sent John out
with his gun and he had shot the dog. John
had told everybody in the uloo he would
shoot any dog if it ate Megga’s hens; but
Nardadu had never forgiven Megga for the
shooting. She did not blame John. He did
as he was told.
Nothing had been the same on Nyedee
NATURAL HISTORY FOR BEGINNERS.
“Why do hens cackle, Dad?”
“Because, my boy, they belong to the female species.”
since tlie chickens came. Nardadn believed
that Megga’s hens were the cause of all that
went awry on Nyedee afterwards. Nar-
dadu’s was not the only dog John shot because
he had eaten one of Megga’s hens. The uloo
bore Megga grudge because of her hens and
the dogs John had shot for eating them.
It was beyond anything natural to men and
women, Nardadu had decided, the way John
and Megga lived in their new house among
the trees, with an abundance of food and
clothing, shade from the sun and shelter
from the rain. They looked about them
with pride and contentment. John strutted
out from the house to the stockyards and
blacksmith’s shop, or stretched reading on the
verandah when he was not away mustering
or on the road with bullocks for market. And
Megga cooked, scw T ed, watched over her china
and sat on her chairs, teaching girls from
the uloo to scrub, polish, make gina-ginas for
themselves. Only two of the youngest gins
were allowed into the house, after they had
scrubbed their heads and bodies all over with
soap and water, every morning, and put on
fresh dresses. Other women from the uloo
were permitted to sweep round the verandah,
in turn, or to help with the washing; but
that was all. And always there were new
sheds going up. sheds for harness and tools,
a butcher miah. shade miah for the hens
even.
The station was growing and prospering.
John and Megga were growing old with the
station ; but still there were no children on
Nyedee except children from the uloo who
played about the stockyard and woodheap
sometimes. Down at the uloo they were
concerned about it. The old women sug-
gested that both John and Megga should be
advised to take a mate. But Megga. it was
agreed, was beyond the age of child-bearing.
The men asked John why he did not get a
woman. They did not understand his not
having a woman except his sister, who was
not a wife, to live with him. John laughed
and said he had been too busy making the
station to think about a wife and family.
Men of the uloo believed what he said. They
had seen him so often, after a day’s hard
riding, eat, and sleep as soon as he rolled
in a rug beside his camp-fire. They under-
stood he had thought of nothing but his
station and cattle for years.
But the seasons were good. It rained —
how it rained that year ! It had not rained
since on Nyedee as it had rained then. Nar-
dadu herself, and all the other old women
in the camp, had gone down to the creek
and beaten it back with green branches
when the muddy water swirled over its banks
towards the uloo. They had been kept
busy patching their huts to keep the rain
out. Grass was green on the plains in a
day or so; thick and deep in no time. The
cows grew fat. Nardadu clucked with plea-
sure over their milk and calves thick-set
and sturdy. Megga, busy and masterful,
directed everybody and everything, looking
stouter, more good-humored, every day. Since
the hens and chickens had come she seemed
to have nothing left to wish for.
John went off mustering after the rain,
taking all the boys, two or three gins and
most of the horses with him. The grass and
herbage everywhere made him gay and light-
hearted. He talked now and then in easy
familiar fashion with Chitali and the boys
as he rode along; or when they camped for
tlie niglit, lie by his fire, they by theirs,
at a little distance.
They were chasing breakaways in the back
hills when the boys came on tracks of wild
blacks from the other side of the range.
Nyedee boys said these were cousins of
theirs. John Gray visited the camp, talked
to the old men, and in the evening when
Nyedee boys were sitting, singing round the
camp-fire of the strangers, a young gin was
sent to John Gray's camp by way of courtesy
and hospitality to an honored guest.
Nyedee boys marvelled when she did not
return immediately as others had always
done from John Gray’s fireside.
And in the morning John had presented
the old men of the camp with pipes, tobacco
and a couple of blankets.
Somehow Megga had heard of it. The
boys talked when they got back to the uloo.
They had told their own women and the
old men, who chuckled, laughing, and smell-
ing what was to follow.
Megga had been angry with Minyi for
breaking a cup. Minyi, to make her angrier
and to take her mind off the cup. had told
Megga of the gin John kept by his camp-fire
that night in the Nyedee hills. Megga was
furious. The girls heard her talking to John
about it. John had been angry, too. angry
and sulky. lie walked up and down the
fence for hours afterwards. For many
nights he walked the fences, morose and
restless. Out on the run it was just the
same, the boys said. John did not sleep as
lie used to —threw wood on the fire half
the night, and walked about.
The blacks watched him fight out his
trouble. They knew well enough what was
fjie matter with him. His mouth took a hard
line. Nardadu had seen John striding back-
wards and forwards at night, sombre and
angry as her old bull when he went moaning
ami bellowing along the fences, separated
from the herd. John had scowled at every-
body who spoke to him during the day.
He could not break the habits Megga had
imposed on him; would not drink more
whisky than he did usually, or have gins
about him. But after he had been south
with cattle that year he brought back the
kurrie.
She was with him in the old high buggy
he had driven over from Karara in, and
John looked as pleased with himself as
Megga had looked when the new house sat,
all built-up and whitewashed, on the plains.
He had got what he wanted.
And Megga! Nardadu saw Megga’s face,
as though by lightning, so bleached and stiff
it was. Megga had not known John would
bring this other woman with him to Nye-
dee. He kissed Megga and said:
“I’ve got a surprise for you, Meg. This
is my wife.”
Megga did not speak, while the other one
laughed, saying in a high, singy voice:
“My name’s Margie!”
John went on, as if he had done something
as much for Megga’s sake as his own:
“It was getting a bit lonely for you, Meg,
with no white woman to talk to. You aud
Margie’ll be company for each other.”
Nardadu could see and hear them still as
if they were corroboreeing before her.
Megga, ’ fat and d.umb, in front of the girl
on slight, bare-looking legs; Meetchie —
which was the uloo’s way of saying “Mrs.
Margie”—in her light frock and hat, holding
a red sunshade; John between them, proud
and pleased with himself.
They were delighted with the kurrie at the
uloo : delighted and excited by her light,
brijfhtly-colored dresses, patterned with
flowers; her necklaces, high-heeled shoes, the
■songs she sang, aud the tookerdoo she gave
them, sweet stuff covered in brown, sticky
loam. John himself stepped with a jaunty
kick and swing as he walked; his eyes
laughed out at you. Nardadu gurgled and
chuckled after him, and men of the uloo were,
very satisfied. Nobody worked very much
in those days; and John was easy to get on
with. lie went about whistling in a queer,
tuneless way. Nardadu had even heard him
trying to whittle her own little song:
Be-be coon-doo-100, coon-doo-100.
Hotv the gins laughed, and he with them,
though Nardadu black-
guarded him furiously
when he took her calves
oft' their milk too soon, so
that the kurrie should
have plenty of cream and
milk in her tea! Black
tea was all the gins ever
tasted. But the chatter
and giggling round the
woodheap where they
drank their tea and ate
their hunks of bread and
meat and jam when it
was suspected why John
was concerned about milk
for the kurrie!
He was angry if Nar-
dadu did not drive the
cows through the Two-
mile gate. Useless to
explain, she was afraid
of a narlu who haunted
the mulga thickets beyond
the gate—the narlu who
had led Warieda from the
tracks and hunting-
grounds of his people,
along the dog - toothed
range. John laughed and
joked with her good-
naturedly enough, but he
would have the cows
taken where the grass
was good. To be sure,
he had sent Munga to
mind the cows with her,
and such days they had
been for Nardadu and her
grandson, out there on the
wide plains, yellow with wind-grass, or in
the dove-grey mulga thickets, under blue
skies, she teaching Munga how to pick-up
tracks, and the movins against evil spirits
and bullets; to find water, snare bungarra
and dig for coolyahs.
Good days! Only in Megga’s face the
satisfaction faded, and the kurrie became
wan and sickly in the hot weather. Nobody
saw her during the day; but in the evening,
when the sun had gone down behind the
hills, she wandered about the verandah and
garden. Wandered, wailing and complaining
about the heat, the dust-storms, flies and
mosquitoes. Up and down she walked; wept
and lamented.
John was very tender with the kurrie in
her weakness and sickness; as kind as he
knew how to be, trying to soothe her when
she cried, “Take me away from this dread-
ful place, John. I loathe it. Life here, it’s
so bare, and hard and ugly!” although it
hurt him to hear her talk like that about
Nyedee. Nyedee, with its wells and wind-
mills, comfortable homestead, garden and
bathrooms ! What more did a woman want 1
Against Megga, though, he would hear no
word or complaint. She was mistress of
her brother’s house: had always been ; would
always be, he said. She cooked, was store-
keeper. accountant, provisioned the parties
of well-sinkers, fencers, musterers, rationed
the blacks, and saw the gins kept the house
clean and in order. There was nobody like
her. Two men could not do what she did.
She knew every well and windmill and what
stock they carried. Megga must go on as
she had always done. Meetchie could never
do what she did; but she was his bourd-
gergia, his little green parrot, his love-
bird.
When Meetchie went away to have her
baby the days flowed on at Nyedee as they
had always done. Long, quiet days, filled by
the riding out or riding in of John and the
boys with cattle or horses; the arrival and
departure of gangs to repair windmills, sink
new wells, make fences, while Megga baked
bread, prepared the meals, salted meat after
the first day of a kill, figured in her account-
books. sewed, worked in the garden, read
and slept. .
Meetchie came back with her baby, bring-
ing cretonne dresses and sweets for the gins.
There was a new. older, more obstinate look
on her face. She did not wail so much or
sing so often; but soon the end of the
house was regarded as hers and the baby s.
Within a few years there were three child-
ren in those rooms at Meetehie's end of the


house: one a girl with hair the color of the
tasselled mulga blossom, a little, fleet, wild
creature who watched the plains for dust of
John’s horse when he had been away and
ran to meet him when the gins cried: “John
cornin’!” No horse on Nyedee would have
let John take the child on his saddle, or
have stood while she flew up by his stirrup ;
but always John dismounted to meet his
daughter, gave his reins to one of the boys,
and, catching her up in his arms, carried her
home on the back of his neck, his face as
childishly joyous as hers.
But Megga and Meetchie barely spoke to
each other. Years only deepened the ani-
mosity between them, although Megga loved
the children as though they were her own,
and Meetchie knew she loved them.
As Nardadu looked at it, the house seemed
to be cramped down over one of those dark,
slimy, fungus growths which poison the air
about them. At the uloo, when the women,
quarrelled and fought together, their shrieks
drifted away ; bad feeling was lost in a day
and forgotten. But there, in the house,
misery and bitterness crouched and clung.
You knew they were about when you went
near the place and saw the women —Megga’s
face set to her contempt and repressed indig-
nation ; the young wife’s face moody and
resentful.
For ten days’ tramping there was no
other building like this John had made in
the bed of a dead sea ; no other house under
those wide, blue skies ; no other white women
to talk to each other but those two.
John left the house to the women as much
as possible. He was out on the plains and in
the hills for weeks at a time. The shadow
lifted from his face as soon as he was out
of sight of the homestead, although he cried
out in pain and anger sometimes as he slept
under the stars.
The conflict which had been going on for
years took a step forward when the kurrie
seized Megga by the throat with her fierce
white hands and would have crushed life out
of her had not John come between them.
Then Megga had gone to live in the old store-
room near the creek.
Meetchie said she could do all Megga had
done. She would cook, manage the house-
keeping, order stores, provision the camps,
feed th« blacks. For months she worked to
convince John she could do as well as Megga ;
but she could not. She had neither strength
nor liking for what she had undertaken;
she struggled on, overburdened, distraught,
screaming at the hens and the gins, losing
her soft young beauty, becoming almost
insane in her weariness and discontent.
John took as much as possible out of hev
hands. But bread would not rise, store-
orders Avere forgotten, tucker-bags lost. He
was cross and impatient. Why couldn’t
Meetchie have left Megga run the place as
she had always done? The station could not
afford to have its work messed up in this
way.
And Megga. living alone in her hut by the
creek, sat gazing over the plains, day after
day, strong, capable hands idle before her;
the light gone out of her eyes. Deprived
of her work, what had she to live for? She
had given everything she had to the station,
helping it to grow. She had reared and
trained it, as she had John. And the seasons
were going from bad to worse. Would it
ever rain again? She could see, and John
knew only too well, how he Avould need her
to relieve him of all the little odd jobs he
did noAv round the homestead in the dry
season ahead. He would have to be out on
the run, moving cattle from well to well,
wherever there was a picking, all through
the blazing heat and dust-storms.
Nardadu could hear them talking over at
the house, Megga, Meetchie and John. Their
voices came to her, clashing and clanging
against each other.
“Your sister means more to you than I
do !-”
“What is it you want now?” John’s
voice that was, surly and menacing. “Meg
has left you the house. You want her to
clear off of Nyedee, is that it?”
Meetchie made a long wail of grievances.
Megga was always interfering, setting the
children against their mother, and the gins
would only do as she said. Meetchie had
told Coonardoo to catch and kill a hen for
the children’s dinner, and Megga had said
no more hens were to be killed. It was
always the same. If Meetchie told the gins
to do one thing and Megga told them to do
another, they obeyed Megga. “Either she
goes or I go!”
“Turn my sister out for you?” John
shouted. “Not on your life ! She went to the
hut of her own accord. But further she
shan’t go.”
John had left the house and was striding
across the red earth and ironstone pebbles
towards Nardadu.
Beside the little windmill Coonardoo and
Minyi, who had been listening to and watch-
ing the quarrel, turned to get Avater. There
was no wind : the mill-fans, hung motionless.
Coonardoo, climbing wooden stays of the mill,
swung the wheel; Minyi pumped, and filled
the fire-blackened kerosene buckets. Two
slight, straight figures, buckets on their
heads, the girls moved slowly back to the
house.
John walked to the shed before which the
buggy was still standing. Nardadu had
her affections, superstitions. They stirred as
she watched John coming from the house
towards her. His back was as straight, he
SAvung along with as steady, direct steps as
when she had first knoAvn him, although his
body had thickened and swelled in the white
moleskin pants and faded blue shirt beneath.
But the face under his wide liatbrim, fatter,
redder, was sullen and heavy now; the blue
of his eyes, burned deeper for the years out
there on the plains working cattle under
bare skies, held only passion and defeat.
The beat of his heels and spurs, as they
clicked on the pebbles with a little silver
tinkling, made Nardadu shiver. She remem-
bered she should have been away beyond
the gates with her cows; that John would
shake his fist and yell angrily, if lie saw
her. Her song quavered into a queer, gurg-
ling laughter.
But John did not see her. He Avas calling
Chitali and old Tommy, who had driven
over from Karara with him.
Nardadu listened. John told the boys to
put horses in the buggy again.
When the buggy drew up before the house
Meetchie hurried forward and climbed into
it. John lifted the children in beside her.
He took the reins and they drove away.
Megga, standing on the verandah, watched
them go. Nobody called to her. The buggy
whirled off in dust.
“Wiali!” Nardadu muttered, getting to her
feet. Her instinct, sure and sensitive, told
her Megga had won—and lost —in the fight
which had been going on so long in John’s
house. Megga had got back the place and
work which were hers and driven the kurrie
off.
But John had brought the kurrie to
Nyedee because he wanted a kurrie. And
there were the children. Had he not loved
and played with his children as men of the
uloo loved and played with their children?
More than ever now he would wander along
the fences at night, like that sulky old bull
from her herd; his face turn to Megga as
it did this morning; misery and bitterness
crouch under the long, white house, with its
back to the blue, wild hills.
# * * *
Against the sky-film, thin, clear blue, soft
as the ashes of mulga and mirmerichi, dust
moved.
A cry rose in Nardadu’s throat. She
watched that dust grow against the sky and
the edge of mulga scratching the sky. The
ragged tail of horsemen swept out from it.
Men of the uloo were returning from the
dogging.
They swerved in a wide curve towards
the stockyards, young horses before them.
Nardadu could see Munga in charge of the
packhorses—Munga on his white horse,
ginger with dust; packhorses before him.
The bay mare, a bucket lashed to her back,
made for the troughs, and Munga, after her,
rode her off. The swing-in of dark, slender
legs and flying tails through red mist of
dust; bodies of men and horses joined, free-
flying, galloping; all wildness and grace!
Nardadu exulted. The horseman her Munga

she had to feed him from her fire that night,
as though he were a man!
The song of her gladness trembled, ranged
its bird notes and went wandering out to

A Swarm of Locusts.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DAN PEBERDY, 14 years old and
nearly six feet high, a lathy, immature
growth aided in its general appear-
ance of childhood by the thin pink face
bearded with yellow down and lighted by
very innocent blue eyes, made of himself a
horse —a wild horse that galloped over the
bullant nests that collandcred the road to
school. Not only did he gallop ; he pranced,
pannaded and stampeded ; he ground his boot-
heels fiercely into the entrances of the ant-
nests and destroyed Ant-town, escaping
before the bullants could seize him, and
leaving them impotent, though angry, in the
ruins of their city.
Ten minutes of this violent acting of wild
horses in the thin, dry, heated air brought
him to a temporary standstill of weariness.
He slackened to a walk and then to a slow’
lounging through the park of turpentine-
gums. The pleasant din of the cicadas at
last brought him up all standing against a
great tree, its trunk spotted with the green,
yellow and black insects, their rubefacient
protruding eyes apparently blinded by their
own drumming, their transparent wings
folded at the ends of their backs. And Dan
Peberdy listened to their mullionous noises,
which are all variants of their own song of
gratitude to the sun. Dan translated it as
he dreamed there in the half-shaded heat
and forgot school in listening to the long
chant-royal of all, broken by the occasional
and recurrent sestina of an individual sing-
ing of white sunlight and heated rocks and
quartz glare:
“Blessed the sun
And the haze of the heat,
Smoking the runnels
Shallow in granite,
Boiling the water
In pools of the rock,
Reddening the ironstone
To incandescence.
Gleam of the quartz-reef
Pitiless white;
Snake on the black rock,
Lizards in furnace dust,
Thank and applaud.
We of the summer,
Glad of the white fire,
Praising the sun.”
Dan Peberdy, being now done with dreams
and become materialistic, caught six of the
loudest of the “locus’es” and distributed them
in his pockets, so making them dumb. The
harmless creatures suffered hell in the dark-
ness of the pockets, and Dan added to their
misery by repeating his imitation of a bolt-
ing horse over the last row of bullant nests,
arriving at school with a last loud war-
whoop.
In school he attended to his duty, and his
duty was tin 1 biggest, greenest, most ruby-
eyed cicada. So that while the girl scholars
in the front row chanted the rivers of Russia,
the green insect found himself in a sun-ray
and began to sing like the spark in wire-
less —
“The Volga, the Dnieper, the Don, the Dniester
Tadada—da —da ; tadada —da—da —tada —da—da.”
“Aha!” said the one-armed schoolmaster.
“Come out, Peberdy.”
So the unhappy Dan “came out,” and
being commanded to empty his pockets pro-
duced several “locus’es,” dying; and the big
green fellow took the creases out of his
wings and flew through the window and back
to liberty in the turpentine-gums.
Then the cane said swish to the air, and
Dan Peberdy suffered exceedingly.
* * * *
At the age of twenty-five Dan Peberdy,
slight, well over six feet high, the down cm
his face strengthened to yellow silk, the blue
eyes still innocent as they would always be,
went the way of almost all flesh and mar-
ried. His girl was 22, dark-haired, dark-
eyed, with the boyish figure of the athletic
girl. Her people were poor old failures, and
had learned the art of extracting a living
from the world without working by a gentle
art of self-depreciation which enlisted pity
and protection.
On the last day of his bachelorhood Dan
took his girl to a bazaar, and the amateur
fortune-teller there insisted on telling his
fortune —which was all the easier because
the fortune-teller knew all the parties and
admired Dan, being therefore a little jealous
of Dan’s girl.
“I see,” she said, having given him the
usual performance of crystal-gazing to re-
store confidence in this open scoffer —“I see
a green field. It is corn.”
“Good-o !” said Dan, and was bold enough
to continue:
“The com was springing fresh and green
And the lark sang loud and high,
And the blush was on your cheek, Mary,
And the love-light in your eye.”
“This is no joking matter,” said the crys-
tal-gazer. •
“And iny name isn’t Mary, either,” said
Dan’s girl.
“A field of corn.” continued the crystal-
gazer. “The field is you.”
“Much obliged,” said Dan. “Am I 640
acres or a half-section or a Pong’s garden?”
“Oh, do listen!” said Dan’s girl with irri-
tation. For she believed in everything she
couldn’t prove and therefore disbelieved in
nothing. “I don’t care if I am super-
stitious—there’s no sense in laughing at
warnings.”
“When both of you are quiet I’ll go on,”
snapped the crystal-gazer. “The corn grows
to the ear, and then there is a cloud comes?
and withers it. Not once but many times—it
is a swarm of locusts. They eat the corn,
and it grows again, but more weakly each
time, and the swarm of locusts eats it down
at last, until there are only withered
stalks.”
“And all that means what?"
“Your life will be prosperous, taking it
altogether, but beware of a swarm of locusts.”
“Locusts?” laughed Dan. “Locusts?
They’ve done me all the harm they ever
can. I’ve been walloped to a standstill
for having ’em in my pockets at school.”
And he did the wise thing—turned from
locusts and the symbol of himself as a
field of corn devoured, and went to the busi-
ness of life: courtship and bridal and mar-
riage and begetting.
* * * *
Dan and his girl bought a house that
looked to be easy of acquisition because pay-
ments were long deferred. By and by they
discovered that long-deferred payments nr- 1
tne hope that inaketh the heart sick. They
would have been easy but for interruptions.
Their contentment was suburban like their
house; and Dan should have been hajljpy
because his quiver was full. Small head
after small head progressed from the breast
to the little chairs around the table; Dan’s
girl took on a matronly, comfortable air,
and accepted Dan as a commonplace of her
life, whereas he had begun by being its
wonder. And whereas at the beginning he
had been the object of her protection, and
she had held from him little worries and
defended him against the gentle cadging of
her people, now she handed some of her
troubles to him —edged them to his shoulders
and then slipped from under, and helped
the gentle cadgers with a softly-insistent
“Poor father! So unlucky, isn’t he?”
There came a time when to save “poor
father” Dan mortgaged himself and saw
the time-payment system of house purchase
further deferred. The years passed without
effort on time’s part, and Dan struggled
through with Ahem, continuously baulked
of his ambition to win to debtlessness and
a clean sheet. The gentle cadgers gave up
life in their native self-depreciatory way, and
that squared their accounts and left Dan
the deficit. If he, by luck, made enough
chance money to lure him on to new hope,
there awaited at home or around the corner
some new demand. He found that of his
kindliness was born a family of egoists,
daughters of the liorse-leech —all but one who
had inherited his facility in giving, wherefore
she was elected to all positions of sacrifice.
Without the parties knowing it there was
set up an inoffensive alliance _of the
besieged—father and daughter against the
egoists. These were seven and were as
seventy times seven in their demands. The
bear would be branded and trained to draw
a waggon if he were as quiet as a horse, and
the monkey escapes work only by biting and
refusing to understand orders.
I have seen, palanquin-bearers in Canton
who had by long callousing of bearer-straps
achieved great warts on the shoulders near
the neck. Beginning as a sore the wart had
grown into a knob good to support the strap.
On the character of Dan long oppression had
grown such callosities, and he bore all that
came his way so easily that the removal
of necessity for sacrifice would have made
him uncomfortable by loss of habit. Begin-
ning with a calf he at last carried the bull;
and demands were about to be made on him
to increase his strength so that he should
carry a locomotive.
The children married, and new sons- and
daughters-in-law came to increase the weight
he thought he had lost. Dan girded himself
up to meet it, saw the last chance of getting
square with responsibilities and the world
outside, and became a drifter to the respon-
sibility furthest removed, while being the
abject slave of the nearest demand.
And he and the daughter who was of
the same kindly sensitiveness as himself,
and ready to bear everybody’s burdens, at
last made the tremendous discovery that two
unselfishnesses produce many egoists, and
that the protectiveness of one strength is
the father of many weaknesses. Dan could
see families whose heads he had arraigned
for hard-heartedness finding pleasure with
honor in children who had learned to swim
by finding themselves in deep water.
Once he told the other half of the in-
offensive alliance about the crystal-gazer and
the swarm of locusts and laughed at it as
an idle superstition. “No enemy or stranger
eats me,” said Dan —“only the people I
love:”
Dan was in error. Great is Allah, and
that which is to be will be.
Dan’s exercise of unremitting work had
strengthened him; he seemed to thrive on
trouble. And then resiliency left him in a
moment; the bow bent too far and the bow
cord parted. Trouble had harped too long
on the G string.
Paralysis laid him aside for years, and
the one born in his likeness was his only
stay. His trouble taught the others no
new unselfishness —at least no new unselfish-
ness for him. When the tree falls none
seek to nrop it, but rather desire to cut it
up for firewood. And there were new lives
around them—new little kings who knew not
Joseph. So then the daughter who was
like him failed early as he had failed late
—died in fact, and absolutely; not partially
as he had done.
At last his long wait for the new friend
that had taken early the other half of his
inoffensive alliance came to a crisis, and
Dan was dying. Recent memories departed,
to be replaced bv the memories of childhood:
cicadas drumming in the turpentine forest ;
himself galloping over the nests of the mani-
acally angry bullants; himself suffering at
school while the great green insect pressed
the agonising creases from liis transparent
wings and flew out to liberty. With the
noises of their song of the heat in his
ears, Dan opened his eyes and looked at the


garden outside filled with summer and heard
from the room beyond the relatives parting
his vesture without casting lots.
“That’s mine.”
“No, that’s mine—mother gave it to me
years ago.” •
“Well, that’a mine.”
“No.” said a third voice, “that’s mine.”
Dan’s habit came back to him. “Let ’em
all have it,” he said, and stopped to listen
to a new noise in the garden—new-born
cicadas in the turpentine-gum singing of
heat and light and courtship and marriage.
“A swarm of locusts,” said Dan to him-
self and died by mere effluxion of time.
Snakes on the black rock,
Lizards in furnace heat
Thank and applaud ;
We of the summer,
Glad of the white fire,
Praising the sun.
And Dan lay there quiet and shrivelled,
the mere wing-case of a man —a field
stripped and withered. It is a tragedy to
be born green.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE one tiling of which the little old
hirty felt surest in all the world was
that no one could possibly save her
from her impending fate. Wildly her eyes
went to the garden beyond the small window,
the garden that had been her haven of peace
and happiness for half a century, as if she
were searching for the ghost of one of those
who had so lovingly guarded her in bygone
days. Surely there was one to come to her
rescue now ! But no, even the loved ghosts
—and they came often to her in other hours
—kept hidden within the shadowed past.
Out there in the garden the summer wind
went gambolling among the leaves of the
high fig-tree that she and her boy-husband
together had planted fifty years ago. It
was a very old tree, yet not so old by a
score of years as she herself. She looked at
it again suddenly envious. There was no
one at hand with ultra-modern ideas burning
to transplant it to greener pastures, to
insist upon rejuvenating it, to forbid it its
sacred meditations.
Her tearless eyes smarted. They had
grown old together, she and the tree, in the
self-same corner of the world, and to it was
given the happier lot.
She left the window and went wandering
about the wood-lined cottage of many mem-
ories.
Memories were sure poisons, her daughter
Daisy said.
Daisy was middle-aged, but very modern,
the wife of a busy modern man and the
mother of two particularly up-to-date young
people. She might arrive any moment now,
her mission being to take her little old
mother into her own care for the rest of
her life —to remove her from these scenes
that kept her memory so green, or, in her
own words, that kept the poison circulating
in her veins.
The old lady stopped at the silent hearth.
That was her chair, this his. and he came
back to it of an evening still, put his feet
up by the mantelpiece, smoked his old brown
p'pe and nodded placidly whilst she talked.
She was very sure he came back, for they
had settled it together long ago that whoever
went first should return at quiet hours
to the old easy chair.
Had they not gone together for half a
century or more until one year ago, when
he had suddenly let go, and left her lonely.
Her poor old man !
His slippers
were there in his
clothes - cupboard
ready for rest-
times ; his hat was
on its peg in the
back hall; his pipe
and the paper
spills he had used
for lighting it,
there at his own
end of the mantel-
piece. At her end
was the knitting
she had not taken
up again after the
old pipe had last
been laid down.
Oh, how could she
go away from it
all! She felt she
would leave blood
tracks along the
way w T hen they
dragged her from
her home and its
ghosts and its
memories.
Fifty years and
more ago he, her
young lover, had
built this home
with some little outside aid, and they had
gone into it before it was much more than
half-finished, being eager to begin life
together.
Five and forty years ago and a little son
and daughter had made merry music in this
earthly Eden, and she and her husband had
toiled early and late to win comforts for
them while yet it was day.
Twenty years ago and the little daughter
had slipped away into a garden of Eden of
her own to help another boy-husband and to
rear young lives.
Ten years ago—a long, long decade—and
her son had gone away oversea to win a
place in a city of the Old World. And then
she and her husband had “settled down” to
grow old together.
And one year ago. before they had really
begun the growing old. as they imagined it
should be carried on. he had tired quite,
suddenly one night and slipped home first.
Paving her alone with the shadows and the
silence.
But it was all to end now—to-day. they
said. Daisy. her modern middle-aged
daughter was coming to take her away to
live out her days in a busy suburban home
away from ghosts and memories —to be
“guarded and minded.”
She pressed her thin little hands over her
eyes, compressed her lips into their most
stoical curves, and called all the defences of
her nature to protect her from herself. And
at last she attained to steady eyes, straight
shoulders, firm mouth, hard voice.
“I have decided, Daisy, I shall not go
with you,” she said. “I have much to do.
No, lam never lonely! I shall not go.”
The words rang out defiantly in the silent
room; but sharp upon the last of them came
the sound of wheels on the path outside and
the call of a motor horn.
“Oh!” she cried, and went hurrying into
the hall to fling open the front door.
There was the car, and the chauffeur was
leisurely turning the wheel to bring the cum-
bersome thing as near to the front step as
possible. Yes, and there was Daisy in a
dustcoat and with motor-veil tied snugly
under her chin. She stepped forth and stood
for a long minute absorbedly studying the
face of the little house with its open door,
its casement-windows, its generous veran-
dahs.
In the days of long ago, and once upon a
time, she had played dolls and mothers
upon that verandah ; had run in and out of
those doors; had tumbled down these steps—
in happy pinafore days of long ago ! Yes,
and had crept for comfort from sorrow
and oppression into her mother’s arms; had
fallen to sleep on her lap!
Now she looked at the face of the old home
and shrugged her shoulders, and then she
looked at the face of her old mother and
smiled humoringly.
“Mother !” she said, slowly mounting the
steps she had so often tumbled down, “it’s a
queer little relic, isn’t it?”
“Well, dearie!” said the old lady, and
smiled diplomatically. “Yes, it’s a queer
little old place!”
“But you’re not ready!” said the daughter.
“That’s bad. We’ve no time to spare. I’ve
an appointment with my tailor this after-
noon and I’m due at my club at four. Where
is your suitcase? Come and pop on your
hat and coat.”
By now they w T ere walking along the
small hall, the old woman with her gallant
grey head very high and her shoulders quite
straight; the young one with a vexed smile
barely showing about her well-schooled lips.
“Daisy,” said the mother, over her shoul-
der, just casually, “I’m not going with you,
after all. I’m perfectly decided. Nothing
can move me. I was just going to send a
telegram to you. I’d sooner die.”
Daisy wheeled abruptly from the open
sitting-room door and turned into the bed-
room. She opened a cupboard.
“Here’s your hat,” she said. “Now look
alive, mother dear. Look alive.”
She put the hat on the grey head with a
firm hand and, opening her handbag, drew
out a black motor-veil.
“Stand still,” she said. “Wait till I tie
you up—the wind’s enough to lift one bodily
from the car when we go hard.”
Her mother clasped her hands wildly and
her face went grey.
“I’d sooner die—-I’d sooner die. Your
father comes of nights. I can’t leave him to
wander alone about the house. I’ll die,
Daisy, if you pull me up by my roots.”
A high commanding voice rose higher.
“You promised,” it said. “Now say no more.
You’ll go daft if you stay any longer alone
with your ghosts !”
“You took me at a weak moment, my girl,”
the mother pleaded. “We all have our weak
moments.”
“Mother!” said the younger woman, “if
I carry you off by main force you are going.
See?” And she began fastening doors and
windows.
Her mother, following her, came to her in
the sitting-room and stretched out her arms,
the thin, yellowed wrists showing below the
white pleated lace at the cuffs.
PROOF OF IT.
“Heigh, heigh! That razor of yours ain’t very sharp.”
“That’s remarkable, sir. I coulda swore I cut a hit orf’n your
chin with it a minute ago!”
“Your father comes and goes. Daisy,” was
her cry, and the slow tears rolled down her
wrinkled cheeks. “He was here last night
and I can’t let him come and find me gone.
Don’t tell me he isn’t lonely. He’ll be
lonely till I go, too. He comes and goes,
Daisy, in and out of all the rooms, in his
slippers.”
“Mother, you make me creepy!” chided
the daughter, and her brisk movements and
harsh voice closed her mother’s lips.
She almost lifted her mother, now inert,
into the car. “It comes of living so much
alone,” she murmured. “Now, from this
moment, you are my little girl. The first
lesson you must learn is obedience.” She
began fussing over her, tucking the rug about
her and so on.
And then she suddenly stooped and kissed
the tragical old face, feeling foolish to be
so moved.
* * * :!:
A quarter of a year later the old lady
lay a-bed at eight o’clock on a bright and
sunny morning awaiting permission to arise
and put on her clothes —she who was used
to being astir with the birds and busy over
household concerns.
Her glance wandered d’sconsolately around
the beautiful guest chamber, now known as
Granny's room. The black oaken suite must
have cost quite a hundred pounds; the warm
thick carpet was such as she had never had,
and rarely seen before in her life, and the
luxurious easy chair simply invited one to
be lazy. Besides these guest-room furnish-
ings, modern and in excellent taste, two pic-
tures, quaint with the quaintness of time
long past, had place—probably as concessions
to old age. The one depicted a buxom lad
and lass lovemaking by a stile; the second,
the same healthy-loqking couple walking arm-
in-arm from a church, having obviously just
celebrated their rustic wedding.
Pettishly the old lady turned from the sen-
timental scene to gaze longingly upon the
neatly folded staca of clothes that she so
desired to don. But well had she learned
the lesson of obedience to the commands of
the lady of the house! When the morning
WON’ERFUL MEMORY FOR MUGS.
“I ain’t any good at rememberin’ names, but onct I see a mug!”
“Yus, me too, especially with the frorth on.”
was only at seven, the bright face of her
grand-daughter had peeped in at the door,
and a gay, laughing voice had said:
“Granny, mother says you’re not to put a
foot out of bed until she has overhauled
you.”
“Oh dear, oh dear!” the old lady had
wailed, and her voice had gone trailing off
into a sob. “I did so want to get up early.”
But there was none to hear, the laughing
girl having run off to her morning bath. It
was now eight o’clock and the first glory
had slipped from the young day, the first
glow from the old lady.
By her bedside, on a daintily set tray, was
her almost untouched breakfast. There was
a bowl of milky peptonised food and a plate
of arrowroot biscuits.
A glint of almost savage anger lit her
eyes, but before she could find intelligible
expression for her disgust, the handle of the
door was turned and Daisy, the busy mis-
tress of the house, walked in.
“Good girl!” she said airily. “I was
afraid you might be up before I could get
to you.”
The old lady looked at her very sus-
piciously. “Why shouldn’t I get up if I
want to?” she asked fretfully.
“Any cramp?” asked Daisy gravely.
“No? Any headache? Any pain anywhere
about you?”
Her mother sat up in bed. “I’m quite
well,” she said. “I want to get up. I
want to work. Oh, I want to work.”
“You are never going to work again,”
said her up-to-date daughter. “You must
leave all that for the younger folks. My
theory is that after GO we ought to be saved
all trouble and be treated as little children.
Now I’m your mother, let us say, and I’ve
got to be obeyed and”
“For pity’s sake no massage to-day,”
begged her mother.
“No. No!” said Daisy soothingly.
“And no more of that electric vibratory
thing?”
“No. No!” said Daisy again.
But the old lady plainly was somewhat
distrustful. “And no more of this peptonised
stuff.” Then recklessly : “And no more nuts,
or sour milk, or tonic wine or”
“Now!” warned Daisy, looking severe.
“But a little bit of bacon and a fried egg
and a cup of coffee, and for lunch a bit of
brawn or maybe some cheese or”
She spoke coaxingly and yet with suspic-
ion showing plainly behind her persuasions.
“If you think I am going to let you put
yourself out of this life through wild diet-
ing, you are very much mistaken,” Daisy
answered. “Now listen. I’ve a new doctor
—quite a new man, with the freshest Euro-
pean ideas —coming to see you this morning,
and I’m going to fluff your hair and put you
into a silk dressing-jacket and”
But her mother had sunk back upon her
pillows and was crying piteously, “Go away!
Go away!” just as if she were a little girl
of 30.
But he came, the new doctor with the
freshest ideas. The old lady lay quite still
and let him prod her, and ask her questions
and suggest answers to them. One would
have sworn that she was just benumbed by
this early-morning happening—not even
Daisy could have dreamt of how marvel-
lously quickly her thoughts were working.
Finally the great man sat down by the
bedside, and with unction drew up a brand-
new scheme of living and of diet for this
quiet-looking patient.
But it was a sorry-sounding scheme.
There was to be massage, with half a dozen
other queer-sounding treatments. And the
diet! Everything she hated most in food
and drink was to be given to her, and none
of those dainties for which she had such a
weakness were to be permitted her.
Also there was a sinister hint of a minor
—quite a minor—operation.
But the old lady lay still with serene eyes
fixed upon their animated faces.
❖ ❖ ❖
The one thing the gaunt, lonely man felt
surest of was that there was no one now to
care whether he lived or died.
He lifted his eyes to the night-filled
heavens, and the pale stars seemed to light
recesses of his being, so that his memory, a
drugged half-dead thing, aw T oke from its long
sleep and stabbed him till the tears of pain
blurred his eyes. He had gone away a young,
strong man to make good, to win fame arid
bring home laurels to lay before his own old
people. And he had failed, failed to make
good—even after striving for years and years.
Then he had tired, and just drifted, one of
earth's derelicts, to all seeming; alone in the
world.
But the call of the old home is a strong
call. Two months ago he had set out, in
an immigrant ship, for Australia, osten-
sibly to begin life all over again in a young
land of sunshine and hope—in reality, said
his heart, to look upon the faces of his own
people before they should have passed
hence.
It was no hard matter to find the old
home. It stood there in no way altered—
no, not by so much as a change in its color-
ings.
And all the years that had passed; years
that had seen him change from a youth full
of ardor and ambition, to a world-weary
and hopeless man!
The trees, he saw, had grown older, the
hedges thicker', the shrubs denser, more
beautiful; otherwise all things about the
little place seemed to have just been sleep-
ing.
From a neighbor he learned how matters
had gone—learned how the young son had
gone away and become a big man in some
other land; how the daughter had married
and done well for herself; how the old
couple had tarried here, ever busy, ever
happy, with their fruit-trees and their bees,
and flowers and poultry, not care-ridden, and
not overburdened with riches; then how the
old man had fallen asleep one night, and
how the old woman had stayed on all alone,
until the daughter had come in her car and
shut the casement windows, drawn all the
blinds, put a padlock upon the gate and
taken her mother away.
“You could hear the poor old thing crying
and begging to be left to die here,” finished
the neighbor. “But the daughter would have
her own way.”
At the ending of this story fire burned in
the stranger’s heart.
* * * *
The little old lady stole into the shadowy
garden alone. She had had her massage and
her vibratory treatment: she had had her
Russian culture and her grated nuts: she
had had her mild exercises and those tiring
heel-toe ones.
Everyone else was out. Most important of
all, Daisy was out. She had gone to a
meeting of ladies interested in getting funds
and making plans for founding a Home for
Old Eadies.
Daisy’s mother stole into the garden
almost tiptoe. She had a small suitcase in
one hand, and in each of her cheeks burned a
scarlet spot.
She was running away. Running away
at 74!
She remembered reading a poem which
spoke of God walking in a garden, and as
she hurried along now, with the light step
of a girl, it soothed her to tell herself that
lie was walking by her side.
“It seems the likeliest place in all the
world for Him to choose to walk in,” she
mused. “But I think my garden would have
pleased Him more than this stiff place!”
Still, it was good to tell herself that He
walked with her, “for,” said she with a dry
sob, “I’m a lonely old woman, and there
is no one to stand by and save me.” No
one in all the world! No one!”
She came along to the gate and, pausing
there, was a gaunt man in shabby clothes
that hung slackly upon him—a poor-looking
man, who had known suffering, as any could
see.
She caught her breath, she who had been
thinking of God walking in a garden, she
who had felt most utterly alone.
At the same moment they started forward
and ran with a cry into each other’s arms.

Moon Forest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LIKE a great cat the engine purred
Soft and content.
Drugged with her speed, we spoke no word
As through the steel-bright noon we went,
Till unaware we crossed the fine
Invisible dread borderline
Between man’s sphere and Elfinland.
Through such a forest as might stand
Upon the blind side of the moon,
For thirty miles the car took flight.
The engine’s croon
Was all the sound Ave heard, in spite
Of that hot wind that lashed the trees —
And twisted elfin shapes Avere these:
Leaves grey-green, silver-blue and pale
Bronze, like a living fairy tale.
Pale stood the forest in the heat,
Pale shadows huddling at the feet
Of the smooth tree-trunks wliitely fair
Or moon-splashed silver; here and there
Grey remnants of some tattered dress
Hung loose on that white nakedness.
Yet to a seeing eye as gay
As they Avere scant the colors lay;
Red lacquer twigs, and starred with tight
The pallid boughs were tipped with bright
Gold lacquer buds, to break who knows
Into what cloud-flower, what moon-rose?
Except the trees no living thing
We saw, save twice or thrice a wing—
A scarlet, blue and emerald flash
From earth to bough ; a parrot-splash
Gay as the tAvigs; so brightly lit
We hardly could believe in it.
Only the silent restless trees
Mile after mile
In their unfatliomed ecstasies!
Now and again the sky Avould smile
Aloof and frail the branches through,
A patch of Heaven, egg-shell blue.
No help there! Not that this wild place
Was hostile, but it held no trace
Of earth’s accustomed tolerance.
The leaves kept on their frantic dance
As up the moon-pale track Ave sped
Over the hill,
Down through the silvery glades ahead.
They held no friendliness, but still
When, dazed, we turned about to go
Back to the fields that all men know,
That cankering load within the mind
Not all our speed could leave behind
Was lightened somewhat in that place
By arts transcending time and space.
For this was no enchanted wood,
Enchantment’s very self it stood,
Silent and pale to vanish soon
Back to the uplands of the moon.

DOROTUEA MACKELLAR.
The Guile of Grandma.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
GRANDMA was staying at Edna’s home.
The dear old lady was periodically
shunted from one of her devoted mar-
ried daughters to another, staying a month
with each of her large pre-Stopes family,- but
usually managing to sneak a few weeks over
her official stay. Of course, her devoted
daughters loved her, but an old lady was a
bit of a nuisance in the house of a grown-
up family. So they shared her out through-
out the year, though there weren’t enough
married daughters to carry her on from
January to December. She eked the year
out, however, with an occasional visit to
one of her few old friends left, and boarded
in the intervals between family Ansits.
Grandma Avas really no trouble in the
house, she was too old—or too cunning—to
do anything for the family. She used to be,
she said, an exquisite darner of stockings,
but her eyesight was fading, and she really
didn’t like to ask any of the family to be
continually threading her needle. She bore
the reputation, too, of being able to make
the most exquisite scones ; but when the par-
ticular daughter with whom she was staying
hinted that Grandma might show her ancient
skill at this polite and useful accomplish-
ment, Grandma always declined. She wasn’t
accustomed to these new gas-stoves and these
electrical contraptions. Give her an old
firewood oven and she would guarantee to
turn these things out as she did in the old
days. Unfortunately, nowadays, they used
gas-stoves; and, frankly. Grandma didn’t
know anything about them. Grandma knew
many a thing besides making scones.
To Edna Grandma was inconceivably
ancient. The flapper used to wonder why
she kept on living; she couldn’t get any-
thing out of what Avas left of her life; yet
she seemed quite content and even cheerful.
It was simply awful! There she was. like
a gnarled old image, sitting so still, think-
ing, thinking. What on earth had she to
think about? What joy could she conceiv-
ably have now? Yet Grandma was quite
alert, and when it was time for her to be
shunted to the next married daughter, she
always contrived to be too ill to be shifted,
and she was quite content to put off her
departure till she felt a little- better. And
she used to confide in whatever daughter she
Avas staying with at the time that Lizzie,
the next in turn, was the one girl that she
did not get on with.
“Don’t trouble, my dear,” she would say.
“I’m quite comfortable here.”
A gay young thing like Edna, of course,
had no use for Grandma. But Edna pitied
her in her loneliness; and one evening, Avhen
by some mistake there was nothing doing
and Edna was bored stiff with the family,
she made her way into Grandma’s bed-
sitting room, the worst in the house. She
found Grandma sitting up in bed, with her
nightcap—it couldn’t be called a boudoir-cap
—on her thin locks, and her treasured old
Bible beside her. Edna, however, was sharp
enough to notice that the Bible was upside-
down. and that, half-concealed by the cover-
let, there was one of those “Flaming Flap-
pers” novels peeping out.
“Oh, Grandma!” gasped Edna, “you don’t
mean to say that you read that sort of
book! You’re much too old to be trusted
with that. I’m ashamed of you! What
wouid mother say if she caught you at it?
At your age. too !”
Grandma smiled. “I’ve been looking into
the book of youth,” she said, picking up
“The Flaming Flapper.” “I suppose, Edna,
this is the sort of thing that is going on
in your generation all over the world? It’s
quite interesting.”
“Oh, that’s a bit over the odds, that book.”
Edna apologised for the millions of flappers
in the world. “We’re not as hot as all
that, but we do love to read about it.”
“So do I,” mused Grandma; “but. my
dear, it doesn’t surprise me in the least.
Girls will always be girls, though you call
them flappers nowadays.”
“Of course you’re dreadfully shocked,
Grandma?” said Edna.
“Not shocked at all, my dear. In my
days” Grandma looked almost wicked.
“If this book really tells the truth, I become
more and more certain that nothing really
changes in life; and here you young things
are thinking yourselves the last word, while
all the time you’re just imitating us fifty
years ago, and not taking the wonderful
opportunities that are opening to you.”
Edna gasped.
“You’ve all got to come to it —marriage,
I mean—some time, somehow; but with all
your wiles you’re not getting married off as
we got ourselves married off when I was
a girl in crinolines. You’re seventeen, my
child, and you’re only a child still, a baby.
Have you got anybody in your eye yet? At
your age I had had several affairs, and was
deciding which of the eligibles I would snap
up. There were plenty of eligibles in my
young days; but I don’t see any hanging
about you. Those boys of yours, what good
are they to you? Take you to dances and
all that; spend their money on you—what
little they’ve got. But are any of them able
to provide you with a comfortable home and
pay for your upkeep for the rest of your
life? Men do that, you know, if you know
how to manage them. And that is just what
you don’t know. Oh, you think yourself
marvellously knowing; but when I remem-
ber what I knew about the weak points of
young men, and how wickedly I took advan-
tage of them, you are in the beginners’ class,
my child.”
Grandma smiled a crafty smile.
“You see,” the old lady went on, sitting
up in bed, “you flappers give yourseNes awaj r
THE TRAGEDY.
“Terrible the way Simpson is drinking lately!”
“ Yes. Always by himself.”
—and no female should ever do that. Look
at you! Look at the amount of leg you
display in the streets, and even in the ball-
room ! If you’ve got ankles all the way up
or calves all the way down, you can’t dis-
guise them. You actually parade them!
You put all your goods in the shop window.
And your figures!”
“Mine’s all right,” protested Edna, and
so are my calves.”
“Yes, but in my days, every girl had a
perfect figure. We took precious good care
about that. You may laugh at the crino-
lines we all wore; they were certainly un-
comfortable, but they were designed for a
deep and crafty purpose. It was the crino-
line that gave us our perfect figures. As
the shape of our limbs couldn’t be discovered,
the poor dears of my time assumed that we
Avere all angels. Nowadays a girl walking
down the street shows herself exactly as she
is. For all the covering she wears she might
as well be in her nightdress. What is there
left to be seen of you when you go out for
what you call a jazz? And there you are,
without any mystery left! You’re just a
boyish-looking chum —not a puzzle to be
solved.”
“But those uglv crinolines!” Edna pro
tested. “However could you put up with
them?”
“All." sighed Grandma reminiscently,
“that’s where you make your big mistake.
We girls showed just a hint, just a provoca-
tion that led the poor wretch on. And you’d
be much better off, my dear, if you took to
crinolines again, or even bustles. Don’t
despise the crinoline! We girls knew
exactly how to mangge them. You have
no idea of what a crinoline could reveal, for
one exciting instant, when it was managed.
And that glimpse of forbidden underwear
was, you can take it from me, more exciting
than when you cross your limbs on a tram
or a ferry-boat. We showed only a forbidden
inch or so ; but it measured infinitely more in
the young man’s imagination.
“And we didn’t go in for sports; we knew
better. Oh yes, it’s delightful to watch you
young things hitting balls across the net and
playing hockey with big heavy sticks; but
what man would be stirred the least bit
when he sees his partner all perspiring and
flurried and leaping about? They may win a
championship but they don’t win a man.
I’ve seen you young things on the golf-links.
You haven’t got to plus-somethings yet; but
is there anything less attractive than hitting
a ball I don’t know how many yards? I’ve
seen photos of these golf champions, and
I’m sure nobody ever proposed to a golf girl
on the links with her toes turned in. Now,
croquet was different. We just fooled with
the game; but the flirtations that we so dis-
creetly had on the green! Why, when I was
a girl I could play quite well; but do you
think for one moment that I showed that I
could? It flattered the poor man. I’ve been
taught how to play croquet dozens of times by
different partners, and I always was so grate-
ful to my man for the hints he gave me. I
was only a poor young female. Would a
golfing girl give away a single stroke when
she was playing with the most eligible young
man in the club? No, she would stimpy him,
or something—l don’t know anything about
the stupid game.”
“But if you’ve got a good figure,” pro-
tested Edna, “you ought to show it; and I
can’t see how you dear old things ever got
a chance.”
Grandma chuckled. “We knew how to
manage a crinoline,” she darkly said. “Now-
adays you flatten yourselves out, though you
know as well as I do that you simply can’t
do it. Girls are not built that way. You’ve
got curves, and no matter how you build
your dresses, you can’t get rid of them. And
if you could, where would you girls be? My
dear, there is something peculiarly attractive
to the male sex about curves. The poor
thing hasn’t got any, and naturally he loves
them. In my days we specialised in curves.
What was our tight waist for? It was to
emphasise the curves it made—above and
below. You laugh at the bustle, but it gave
us curves! And you think that our tiny
waists were ugly and absurd, don’t you?
But what is a waist for but for a young man
—and an old! —to put his arm around?”
“Yes,” said Edna; “but what did he strike
when he did? Hard whalebone!”
“Well,” admitted Grandma with a smile,
“in my time he couldn’t help but be attracted
by our waists. He knew just where to grab
her. It invited him to grab her. But you
girls have lost that attraction; you’ve done
away with your waists. And let me tell you,
Edna, that waists were given us because they
afforded the best grip for an embrace. We
girls couldn’t escape, even when we wanted
to. I’m not sure, but I think the word you
use now is ‘clicked.’ Well, my dear, we
clicked.”
Edna was half-persuaded.
“And now,” Grandma continued, “you’ve
even got rid of your hair! Oh, yes, shingles
are neat and save a lot of trouble; bur
they’re not in the least romantic. No, my dear,
it’s a bad look-out for you. What have you
got that will get you a husband now? And
you don’t even go the right way about it. How
many proposals, real proposals, have you had,
child? None, of course. Why, at your age.
I had had three. Any girl of seventeen who
hadn’t had at least one was regarded as
unfortunate. If she lasted till twenty with-
out an offer she began to get apprehensive.
I don’t wonder, though. You modern up-to-
date girls don’t know the way to go about
getting a proposal.
“You pride yourself on being so capable, so
athletic, so fond of strenuous play; but none
of these attributes mean proposals. Why,
you’ve actually discarded the best means of
all. My dear, have you ever swooned V”
“Ever what?” cried Edna.
“Swooned! We were taught to swoon —
at the right moment. Without the polite
accomplishment of swooning we’d never have
got our husbands. I don’t suppose you even
know how. At the first tender word all
you’ve got to do, when mother had told you
he was the right man, is to throw yourself
into his arms and faint away. In our days
we girls were so susceptible, you know! The
least hint of a male would so flutter us that
we had to be supported in a manly embrace.
The rest depended upon the girl—and usually
the girl could be depended upon. It’s quite
easy to do, too. It puts the man in such
an embarrassing, but such a delightful, posi-
tion that he can’t help himself. I wonder,”
mused Grandma, “what effect a real Early
Victorian swoon would have upon the modern
young man? It should be worth trying,
though I’m too old to try it myself. Why
don’t you try it, my child?”
“But I don’t know how,” protested Edna.
“No,” smiled Grandma, “that’s the
troubles of all you young modern things;
you don’t know how! But there, Ido believe
that I am getting sleepy. I’ll just finish this
chapter of ‘The Elaming Flapper,’ though I
really don’t think she can tell me anything.
Good-night, dear—and practise swooning!”
Grandma did not see much of Edna for a
few days. Edna was out every night, on
her lawful, or unlawful, occasions. Then
one night there was a light tap at the door.
Grandma glanced at the clock. It was after
one. There was only one member of the
family that kept up so late.
“Come in !” she softly said.
The bedroom door was cautiously opened ;
and there, posing in the doorway was a vision
of sweetness. Grandma’s heart fluttered as
she took in that radiant loveliness. It was
another Edna, an Edna flushed with excite-
ment and softly bewitching.
But her dress! Edna had come from an-
other epoch, from another world. She was
wearing—and oh, how
charmingly ! the crino-
line gown of the Early
Victorian era.
“It was a fancy-dress
ball,” she eagerly ex-
plained. “I was too bmy
getting the damn thing on
to show yon before I went
to the dance. And I had
to keep the car waiting
for half an hour while I
got the set of the skirts
right. The poor boy had
to sit there and watch the
meter piling up the shil-
lings. But nothing mat-
tered once we were at the
ball. And, oh, how distin-
guished - looking Colin
looked with his choker
tie and the mudguards on
his cheeks ! But the funny
thing was that my dress
changed me completely.”
“So it does, my dear,”
beamed Grandma.
“Oh, it wasn’t the
dress, though everybody
loved it; but it. was my-
self. I didn’t know my-
self at all. I felt as if
I had gone back, back to
your young days. Gee,
when Colin gave me a
cocktail I felt that I
shouldn’t! It didn’t seem
right, somehow. I had to
have two more before I
got over the feeling of
doing something wrong.
Colin told me that he had
never seen me so demure
before. Demure! That
was what he called me!
Just fancy me demure!
But I couldn’t help my-
self, really. You know,
Grandma, that I love to
be held tight by my part-
ner, the tighter the tliril-
lier; but in this sort of
thing it simply can’t be
done. I felt I was just
floating around like a
snowflake or some other
ally thing. Something
had got me; and I
couldn’t get away from it.
And all the time I could
see that Colin was look-
ing at me in a sorter
startled way, as if I had
been changed into somebody else. And with
that crinoline shimmying around my knees
I felt that I had gone right back to —to what
you were at my age.”
“I wasn’t as pretty as you are, my dear,”
said Grandma.
“Old model, I suppose; but I’m the latest
chassis. And do you know. Grandma, I
was quite shy with Colin ; and he was shy,
too ; Funny feeling, being shy at my age,
isn't it? And once when Colin, who was
quite uneasy over the change in me,
started to tell me the latest story,
I took the poor boy by surprise—
I believe I blushed! And he flushed, too —
never knew Colin could do it—and he never
told me the end of the story. Seemed
wrong, somehow.”
Grandma reminded her that there had
been stories, the latest ones, in her time,
too. There always were, she said.
“We were both a bit excited, I know;
but. of course, I never let him know how
mushy I was feeling inside. Like a school-
girl ! Colin kept telling me how sweet I
was: and if I had tried I couldn’t he
cheeky; but I simply didn’t want to be.
Yes. Grandma. I managed that switch of
the crinoline all right. I had done a lot
of practice in sitting down, sinking down,
rather, into the couch, just to let him see
a glimpse of- —of -what you used to wear
under the crinoline. He said. ‘What pretty
ankles you have!’
“Fancy a man admiring a girl’s ankles to-
day ! He knows more about knees. But
just that fleeting glimpse I gave him seemed
to cheer him up immensely. And when we
were sitting out, of course, he couldn’t pos-
sibly sit next to me. All the rest of the
couch was taken up by my crinoline. But


Colin did his part quite as if he had been
an Early Victorian all the time. He went
round the back of the couch and leaned
over. Those tight waists do emphasise the
top part of your figure; and, Grandma, the
Early Victorians had opportunities that the
boys don't get to-day. We pretend we haven’t
got any figure; but, in those days you
couldn’t help having one.
“And then he leant down and told me that
he had never guessed how sweet and simple
1 was. He had no idea I was so charming.
I didn’t know it myself until I saw myself
in the glass.
What made us such pals,’ he said, ‘was
that you were such a good sport. It didn’t
matter what I said to you, or what you said
to me, did it? You are always on for any
fun ; and the faster the fun was the better
you liked it, didn’t you?’
“And I told him that I didn’t really like
that sort of fun, but I only did it because
all the other boys and girls did it. All those
gay nights and all the parties left me dis-
satisfied somehow; they seemed so empty
when you looked back upon them; and,
really, we girls did do the silliest things.
But I liked simpler things, like flowers and
concerts, and staying at home, helping mother
with the knitting and the washing-up, and
making clothes and playing the piano, and
cooking—l told him I was a wonderful
cook.”
“But you never even make scones!” pro-
tested Grandma.
“No; of course not. A girl hasn’t
time for those things, has she? But that
was how I really felt to-night; I couldn’t
help it. I suppose it was the dress. When
I think of the demure, simple thing I was all
the night, I can’t understand it at all. But
Colin seemed to like it —must have got a bit
mushy, like me; and he told me how hard
he worked at the office, and how well
he was getting on, and how he would
like to settle down and marry a nice
girl—none of the jazzy cocktail crowd that
never thought of anything but gaiety. But
he asked me where he could find such a
girl; and I looked down meekly and....
waited.
“Yes, Grandma, it was all so wonderful in
that sitting-out place. I told him I was tired
and just wanted to talk sensibly with him.
But there was one thing that worried me—
my waist! It’s all very well being an Early
Victorian, provided you’ve got an Early Vic-
torian waist. I was that squeezed in that
I thought I’d burst something. There were
moments when I felt quite dizzy in those
dreadful stays.”
“Yes,” said Grandma: “I’ve known girls
faint right away.”
“Swoon?” asked Edna. “Well, I felt
almost like it. It seemed worse when I
was sitting down, until at last I had to get
up. I was feeling hot all over. Colin must
have noticed how flushed I was, though I
kept on powdering. I stood there as he came
quickly round from the back of the couch.
I just felt I couldn’t stand it any longer.
NOW WHAT DID THE GIRL MEAN?
“Oh, it’s not so difficult. I just had one lesson.”
“Good Lord! I shouldn’t have thought it!”
when Colin looked at me with a sort of
protective look and whispered, ‘Sweetheart,
I love you !’ ”
“Oh, Edna. I’m so glad!” whispered
Grandma. “You had an offer?”
"I wasn’t surprised— not really,” Edna
admitted with an actual blush. “Somehow
I felt it coming. It was either that or my
poor waist-line.”
“Did he go on his knees?” Grandma
eagerly asked. “We girls always liked it
that way.”
“Oh, Colin hadn’t time for that, for the
next thing I did was—ain’t it absurd? —
was to —to swoon !”
“My dear.” said Grandma, “I did not
know how clever you could be! It wasn’t
everyone of us who could bring off a swoon
at the exact right moment.”
“Yes,” said Edna sadly, “but I’ll tell
you dinkum what really happened. I didn’t
mean to swoon, though I’d have tried to if
I had known how. The silly feeling of being
shaky came over me all of a sudden. It was
all that Early Victorian wasp-waist. It nearly
cut me in two; it nearly stopped my circu-
lation or something; and. Grandma, I just
felt to him, and lie grabbed me.”
“Yes, he would,” mused Grandma. “And,
of course, you were helpless in his strong
arms ?”
“Not much,” said Edna. “But the funny
tiling was that I liked it. I hate being kissed,
really; it’s so mushy. But I suppose I was
only recovering.”
“And then?” asked Grandma.
* * * *
Whish !
Something gave!
There was a sound of the tearing of
material —a sound that Edna had never heard
before, except when the comedian sat down
in tight trousers in a musical play.
“Good-oh !” she gasped. “They’re busted !
Gee. it’s good to breathe again !”
“But it was worth it, my dear!”
Edna took a deep breath. “Was it?” she
asked. “I don’t know. It was all right
while it lasted, but there, you see, it couldn’t!
We girls aren’t built that way. And some-
how, now that I can breathe again, every-
thing seems different. The funny feeling has
worn off. You know, with those mudguards
of his, Colin did look rather a freak. I didn’t
know it at the time; but I see how silly
it all was. And I guess when he wakes up
to-morrow he’ll want to drop it, thank good-
ness !”
“But surely the young man will expect”
began Grandma.
“I’ll ring him up to-morrow,” decided
Edna, “and tell him it’s all off. And that’s
that.”
Edna was herself again.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A CROWD is undoubtedly the largest
and most powerful magnet in the
world. When I see people—even
total strangers—hurrying from all sides to
collect round a motor-accident, a lire or a
bargain-sale, I am immediately stopped and
drawn by some diabolical attraction to the
centre of the uproar. I cannot, however,
much as I may try, pass obliviously on my
way; before I quite make up my mind what
to do, I find myseir one of the noisy particles
of a group. So it was natural enough when
I saw people stopping near by in George-
street that afternoon that I, too, must stop
and inquire what was happening. There
was no need to inquire, however. I had no
sooner paused than I saw the cause of all
the scurry and laughter.
At the corner a gentleman was seated
in a revolving-chair, one of those heavy iron
chairs that big business magnates lounge
about in. This fellow was waving furiously
at passing taxi-cabs, but there was nothing
particularly remarkable in that; people are
in the habit, more or less, of shouting at
taxi-cabs, either to call or abuse them ; but
this man was dressed in nothing except a
two-piece bathing-costume, a grey felt hat,
a collar and tie, socks, suspenders and shoes,
lie wore no coat, no trousers, no shirt. He
was most indecent.
Suddenly a taxi answered his call and
drew up to the kerb, and as he turned to
jump in I recognised him. It was my
friend Bracken.
“Bracken !” I shouted. “Bracken ! Stop !”
He gazed round suspiciously as he heaved
in the revolving-chair, possibly afraid I was
a creditor. Then a look of relief overspread
his face and he swung open the taxi-door to
allow me to enter. I pushed my way soms-
how through a large crowd and sat beside
him.
"Drive to the nearest beach !” he shouted at
the driver, and the car began to move off.
"I hope you’ve got the fare,” he growled
at me, “because I haven’t.”
I nodded. It was worth a taxi-fare to
discover the reasons for his strange costume.
“What’s the big idea?” I asked. “Adver-
tising the lunatic-asylum or a new comedy
film ?”
“Neither,” he snarled ; “it’s because of that
damned Korkum.”
“What’s Korkum been doingV”
“Everything!” he growled. “I’ll cut his
throat when I catch him.”
I cannot tell if it were perversity or a
sense of humor in
the motor-ear that
made its works up-
sctat that
moment. At any
rate, it broke down
an d the driver
pulled up hurriedly.
Immediately a com-
pletely new crowd
collected, while the
driver leaped out to
repair the damage
as quickly as pos-
sible before a traffic-
cop caught him. 1
do not like being-
stared at, especi-
ally in the com-
pany of a gentle-
man with no trou-
sers, and I blushed
to find some • giggl-
i n g shop-girls
amongst the crowd.
So I leaped out and
joined them an d
stared and smiled
with them as non-
chalantly as pos-
sible. Bracken
shoved his infuri-
ated head out of
the window and
abused ns all, while
I pretended never to
have seen him before.
There was evidently not much wrong with
the car, for it was all right again in a few
seconds, and I had just time to leap back
before it went off.
“You dirty dog!” shouted Bracken. “It's
bad enough leaving me to face a mob of
grinning hyenas alone —but to join them and
laugh back at me!”
“Now, now,” I soothed him ; “tell me all
your worries. Start from the beginning and
stop calling me names, or I won’t pay the
fare.”
My threat was enough. After grinding his
teeth impotently and muttering something
I didn’t quite catch about people who ought
to be shot, he sagged back wearily.
“It’s a long story,” he said, shaking his
head in a melancholy fashion, “and a most
pathetic story. It begins at Bondi and ends
in this cab.” He paused as if to choke
something that was trying to bubble out
of his mouth, and after working his face for
a moment or two in all the anguish of remem-
bered wrongs, he continued: “You know I
love swimming, and this summer, happening
to have a few quid, I decided to rent lodgings
at Bondi. I paid a fortnight in advance,
and it was lucky I did ; this left me with
enough cash to enjoy myself with. Now,
my idea of enjoying myself is the usual
one—to get drunk as often and happily as
possible. For three days I lived in Para-
dise, but then for the remaining eleven days
I didn’t have a bean to spend;
“Now I must wander from the point for
a while to describe my lodgings, or rather my
room. It was crammed full of furniture and
enough junk to stock half a dozen Old Curi-
osity Shops. There were millions of odds-
and-ends, dirty lumps of bric-h-brac and old
pots—particularly pots. There were flower-
pots, china pots, brass pots, tin pots
Japanese pots and I don’t know what-
nots. The whole place was a nightmare with
’em, and I lived in constant terror of smash-
ing a few every time I took a step. The
place jingled like an aviary of birds when a
motor-’bus passed outside; and they were
the pride of the landlady’s crabbed old
heart. She wasted all her maternal instinct
on those pots. She cleaned ’em as though
they were bombs and liable to explode if
touched, I dare say she even kissed ’em when
I wasn’t looking. Once I drank beer out of
one that looked something like a pint-pot
that had been through a train smash, and
I thought she’d have murdered me for it.
Tiie way she went on you’d think it had
been her beer, and I would have got the boot
there and then if I hadn’t paid in advance.
As it was she contented herself with putting
grass-seeds in my bed and cayenne-pepper
in my tea, for I had breakfast there as well
as board —that is if you can call a skimpy
plate of toast and two cups of tea that
tasted like boiled water dipped in varnish
breakfast.
“Now, don’t run away with the delusion
that this was a large room. It wasn’t. It
was like an anchorite’s cell. Two people
literally couldn’t move in it. One of you
had to back out first round the table if the
other wanted to get to the door.
“Now the stage is set. Enter the drama.
It began the morning I woke up to find
I hadn’t a halfpenny to my name. I was
lying in bed searching my pockets when it
came to me. An inspiration. I leaped out
of bed and dressed without waiting for break-
fast. The only difficulty was to decide on
the pot. I finally chose the smallest as the
easiest to redeem, and carried it off triumph-
antly to the nearest pawnbroker. I only got
two-and-six for it. but as that was the price
of four mugs and a packet of cigarettes I
was happy. That is. I was happy until
the next morning, when the old landlady
arrived with my cayenned tea and rounds of
toast. I got nervous the minute I saw her
eye wandering round the room, and to dis-
tract her attention I began chatting about
sharks and things. Then she spotted it. Nho
let out a shriek that sent me up in bed like
a rocket, shaking in every limb.
“‘Whhhhat’s the matter?’ I quavered.
“ ‘My Ming vase !’ she squealed. ‘Where
has it gone?’
“I pretended to be immensely relieved and
crawled back to bed. ‘That’s all right,’ I
said airily; ‘I lent it to
interested in these things. 111 get it back
this afternoon.’ ~ ...
“Then she went for me well and truly, ana
although. Dicky. I’m a strong man, I confess
I quailed before her. She threatened po ice
and murder if it wasn't back by three
o'clock; and then, after spilling all my tea
on top of my toast, she buzzed out, slamming
the door so hard that every vase jingled m its
place with terror. I smoKed my last cigar-
ette and pondered the matter. It I wanted to
get that vase back by three I’d only one thing
to do. I did it. The next biggest vase was
furtively taken round to ‘Uncle-; dear old
‘Uncle’: I must be about his favorite nephew
after all these years.
“YER NEEDN’T WORRY ABOUT SHARKS—THE
ALLERGATERS KEEPS ’EM AWAY.”
“The next morning she had hysterics on
the doormat. ‘That Celadon cup was worth
a hundred pounds !’ she shrieked. Of course
I Knew it wasn’t, and it was no use my
telling her that it was only valued at three-
and-fourpence by experts. That would only
have made matters worse. So I did the one
thing possible ; I pawned the next biggest vase.
The following day I had to pawn the next
biggest to retrieve what I was told was a
Ilizen porcelain, valued at a thousand quid.
This went on for quite a while. SSvres fol-
lowed Hizen, and Delft followed Sevres, and
so on, until I had reached the largest, and
the old bird began to get used to it. She
used to pop in every morning and shout
triumphantly: ‘lt’s the Yangtepoodlums to-
day !’ and feel quite happy at having spotted
it. like a game of hide-the-thimble. I believe
she began to enjoy it. But the largest vase
beat me hollow. The only way I could get it
out was to pawn all the other vases.
"So I pawned ’em all and retrieved the
ugly Japanese thing, covered with storks and
pagodas and thin-legged women in bath-
robes, and the old lady had a fit when she
saw the nicely bare room. If she hadn’t
been used to these little junketings I swear
she would have murdered me, what with
the hullabaloo she set up and the way she
jumped about the floor. As it was she gave
me half an hour to get them all back again,
and unless I pawned that large vase once
more the only thing I could do was to give
‘Uncle’ my two suits of clothes. I couldn’t
face the woman in one of her fits again,
so I pawned the two suits. They were
all I had and I was left in my bathing-suit.
That wasn’t so bad at Bondi if it hadn’t
rained. But it rained for two whole days
and was beastly cold, so I had to lie in bed
and starve all the time, pretending to be too
sick to get out.
“When the storm was over I wandered
off down the beach to see if I couldn’t pick
up a dropped purse in the sand. Instead, I
picaed up old Podgy Jones. He was dragging
a thick overcoat winch had become a nuis-
ance in the heat now that the rain had gone,
and it didn’t take much trouble to induce
him to lend it to me. Clothed in that, for
it fitted me literally to the ground, as Podgy’s
nearer seven than six feet, as you know,
and with a clean collar and tie, with boots
and socks, I looked eminently presentable
and went to town on a tram after pawning
Podgy’s scarf, which I’d also borrowed.
“And now comes the villain. I had hardly
arrived in town when I ran into Bill Kor-
kum. He seemed very cut up about it all,
and after shouting a few mugs promised to
lend me a spare suit of his own. Delighted,
I followed him to his office, little suspecting
that the human heart was capable of such
base treachery. I was no sooner there than
he induced me to discard the overcoat to try
on this suit that wasn’t there. He then
ran away with it, and returned with his two
typists and showed me off to them as though
I was a prize pig or something. The girls
stood and giggled until I thought I'd go
mad.
“As a matter of fact. I did go mad. I
chased Korkum with a ruler into his private
office, where he locked himself in. I ranged
the outer office like a caged animal, snarling
at the two typists, who cowered against the
wall, clutching their palpitating breasts, and
occasionally I threw ash-trays and ink-
stands at Korkum’s locked door. At least
I had the consolation of scaring some of liis
clients away.
“But then I heard him ringing for the
police. That scared me well and truly: so
I bolted. I bolted into George-street looking
for a taxi-cab.... And that’s where you
found me.”
To my utter shame. I confess that I
burst out laughing. Bracken looked so
disconsolate, sitting there in his two-piece
costume. I roared, holding my sides.
“And where did you get this?” I asked,
kicking the revolving-chair.
“That?” He grinned maliciously. “I took
th-t from Korkum’s office. By. Jove, it was
heavy. You try to lift it.”
“Whatever did you take it for? Revenge?”
He looked at me and chuckled. “Revenge
be hanged,” he grinned. “That’s to pawn
to get rqy clothes out.”

The Little Town.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHERE the road goes winding down,
Shaded by the arching trees,
Lies a little hillside town,
Little town of memories.
It was there our hopes were formed ;
It was there our dreams had birth,
And it was from there we stormed
O’er the ramparts of the earth.
Restless are the ways we tread
In the larger world to-day;
Barren are the roads that led
From that township far away.
We no more, as in the past,
Dream of glory and renown ;
All our dreams return at last
To the little hillside town.
Youth must dream, and youth must yearn,
Youth must follow glance and gleam,
Till at last we come to learn
That a dream is but a dream;
Till at last we come to know
We are nearer love and truth
Where the lamplit windows glow
In the township of our youth.
O’er the earth we venture far,
North and south and east and west,
But we find our guiding star
At the end of all shall rest
O’er the road that wanders down,
Shaded by the arching trees,
To the little hillside town,
Little town of memories.

Ask Peter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DAWN was just breaking. Small pencils
of light filtered through the dark
eucalypts, and, striking across the
scarred flat, threw into odd relief the mounds
of yellow earth around the long-deserted
claims. As the dawn wind came whispering
through the bush, old Peter Thompson, stand-
ing at the door of his slab hut, pulled his
hastily-donned trousers a trifle higher, and
shivered apprehensively.
“Poor old Jimmy Donovan’s dead,”
repeated the tall, overcoated figure standing
before him.
A smile flickered across Peter’s face.
“Glory be! ’Tis the best news I’ve heard
this many a long day, Mr. Bennett.”
The hotelkeeper thrust out his lips sud-
denly, and then drew them in slowly. “Well;
you’re a rum ’un Peter, and no mistake. I
thought you and Jimmy were mates here
years ago.”
“So we was, Mr. Bennett; so we was —-
thirty year ago. Lots of things happened
since then.”
Bennett nodded. “He died just about an
hour ago. I’m a light sleeper, and I heard
a funny sort of sound—a choky sort of
sound, you understand —coming from his bed-
room. I hurried in to him, but he was
breathing his last.”
“Ah!” said Peter, inhaling slowly. “He
didn’t say anything, now, did he?”
“He did —just two words: ‘Ask Peter.’
And then he dropped back dead.”
“Is that all? H’m! Strange. ‘Ask Peter —-
what? H’m!” Peter frowned thoughtfully.
“So,” continued Bennett, “I thought yon
EVIDENCE IN BLACK AND WHITE.
“C’mon fer a swim, Snowy.”
“Can’t; muvver won’t let me.”
“Aw, she wouldn’t know.”
“Yes, she would. It’s me barf night.”
might like to be one of the first, you know,
to see him. And then I thought perhaps
you might take on the job of digging the
grave. It’s hard sinking up there in the
old cemetery, and the young fellows won’t
take it on ; but you’re used to it —fossicking
and mining all your life. Besides, it’s worth
three pouud ten to you.”
Peter nodded. “All right, Mr. Bennett;
just wait till I gets dressed, an’ I’ll come
along with you.”
Within a few minutes the two men were
following the road into the town, the one
long-striding, young, but ponderous and
heavy-jowled; the other old and stooped,
with creaking joints, shuffling with noisy
steps. The publican wore a heavy overcoat;
a green woollen scarf was wound around
his neck, for it was cold when he started out
to tell Peter Thompson the sad news; and
a cloth cap was pulled well down over his
eyes. The elder clasped his faded blue
dungaree coat close up to his scraggy throat.
The knees of his trousers were padded with
rough patches, each patch stained yellow—
the trade-mark of an old fossicker. A
weather-beaten, shapeless felt hat, threaded
around with a leather lace let in through
slits in the crown, came well down over
his brown, almost emaciated face, the
wrinkles partly hidden by the stubbles of
a week-old grey beard. A full white mous-
tache shaded the lialf-humorous twist of his
thin lips, although a pair of piercing grey
eyes under pendulous white eyebrows still
contrived a twinkle now and then. Over
his shoulder Peter carried two. mining-picks,
and Bennett trailed a spade in each hand,
as they followed the track winding in and out
among the sunlit yellowy-grey dumps of
earth, washed into regular mounds by the
rains of many years.
“You know, Mr. Bennett,” said Peter,
breaking a silence of some minutes, “Jimmy
Donovan an’ me was great mates thirty
year ago—mates for years an’ years, ever
since we was boys.”
“Yes, so he told me.”
“He didn’t tell you anything else, now,
did he?” Peter repeated anxiously.
Bennett shook his head.
Peter Aviped the back of his hand across
his nose and sniffed. “We had a nice little
claim back there at the Four Mile” —he
waved his arm behind liim —“an’ we was
doin’ well out of it. I Avas married at the
time—been married about two years. You
didn’t know that now, did you?”
Again Bennett shook his head.
“Ah, then Jimmy Donovan didn’t tell you
everything.” He leaned over slightly and
Avliispered: “He took her away from me,
Jimmy did. They went to the West—Cool-
gardie, or somewhere there. I never fol-
lowed ’em up.” He sighed; and then raised
his voice. “An’ now, by crikey, he has the
clieek to come baca here —here, mind ! Comes
foolin’ round my little bit of slioav up
Avhere the old Wet lead used to be. Wants
to speak to me. Me, Mr. Bennett!” Peter
raised his clenched right hand threateningly.
“By crikey! I chased him off with a pick-
handle, I did.” His voice quavered, and
trailed away into confused murmurings, and
then ceased abruptly.
In silence they passed along the footpath
of the only remaining street in the tOAvn
that once held thirty thousand diggers and
their followers, going first by one delicensed
hotel, occupied by two sleeper-cutters and
their families, then past a large, vacant
allotment, until they reached the picket-gate
leading to the side verandah of the Post-
office Hotel and Store. Bennett opened the
gate and motioned Peter to enter. Peter
propped his picks against the fence; Ben-
nett placed the spades beside them, and
they tiptoed along the brick floor, and turned
quietly into a wide side-passage in the old
weatherboard house. Midway along this pas-
sage they paused, and, dropping down a
step on the right hand side, Avalked stealthily
along a narrow, dark passage flanked by the
doors of six small “single” rooms.
At the last door on the left, Bennett
stopped. “In here,” he whispered. “The
women’ll have him laid out by this.” He
turned the knob, and with a nod invited Peter
to enter.
They stared down at the still features of
the dead man, his scanty white beard twisted
beneath the white linen jaw-band that was
tied under the tweed cap covering his head.
Bennett pulled a two-foot rule out of his
pocket, spread it open with a flick, and ran
it over the sheet covering the body. “Five
feet six,” he muttered. “Better make it six
feet.” And Peter nodded. He understood
the implied refei’ence, but somehow he
couldn’t speak; not in the presence of the
body of his old mate.
They stepped out into the passage, closed
the door softly, and walked quietly up to
the higher cross-passage.
“Now, what about a drink?” suggested
Peter.
“No,” answered Bennett shortly. “Have
your breakfast first. It’ll be ready in the
kitchen, and then get to work as soon as
you can. I’ll send you up a jar of beer
and some lunch later. I’ll have to get on
the ’phone to the police. There’ll have to
be a post-mortem and an inquest before lie’s
buried.”
“Ah, I didn’t think of that,” said Peter.
Then he snickered. “Jimmy never liked
bearin’ of post-mortems, and now”
Bennett stopped him with a frown. “He
told me the other day he had no relatives.
I suppose that’s correct?”
“He was an orphan, an’ no brothers or
sisters ; but” —Peter lowered his voice—“they
might have had children, you know.”
The publican pursed his lips. “I don’t think
so. He never mentioned any in the three
weeks he’s been staying here. Anyway, his
lawyer will know. He was in seeing him at
Nagambie three days ago.”
“That’s the day before I chased him with
the pick-handle ! H’m !”
But Peter was thoughtful as he stepped
down on to the back verandah, and passed
into the kitchen. “Ask Peter—h’m!” he
murmured. “Ask Peter—what?”
Another generation had arisen since Jimmy
Donovan had gone to the West; still the
news of his death spread rapidly, and at
one o’clock when the policeman arrived with
a tired J.P. and the doctor, in the latter’s
dilapidated car, there was a good muster
of timber-getters, whose fathers and grand-
fathers had been diggers and miners when
Spring Creek was a town —when Jimmy
Donovan and Peter Thompson were mates.
Bennett led the officials into the bar parlor
and set whisky and glasses before them;
and the doctor and the policeman duly pre-
pared themselves for their gruesome task.
By the time they were primed, Peter, hav-
ing finished his job, had come back to the
CONFIDENCES.
“My son’s a credit to me.”
“Lucky man! Mine’s a damned liability.”
hotel on the front seat of the hearse that
carried the shining oak-stained coffin. He
had met the driver on the road as he was
returning from the cemetery.
Peter’s nose was buried in a foaming mug
of beer—not the first nor the third—when
over the rim he caught sight of the doctor
with his faded brown bag leaving the parlor.
“Aha. doctor!” he said gaily—“goin’ to chop
poor little Jimmy open?”
The doctor grimaced, and passed inside,
and the policeman, frowning heavily, followed
him cheerlessly.
Peter wiped the froth from his moustache
with a sweep of his thumb, and banged
the glass pot down on the tin-covered counter,
“The drinks are on me, boss,” he called to
the barman, “an’ mine’s beer.” He dropped
a handful of silver on the counter, and lean-
ing on his elbow, surveyed the groups of men,
all talking, standing in the cheerless, brown-
painted bar-room. Mug after mug and glass
after glass were filled from the big barrel
standing on the counter, as groups broke
apart and the men jostled laughingly forward
to partake of “Peter’s shout.”
“Up with your glasses, boys,” shouted
Peter, now swaying slightly on his feet, “an’
drink hearty.” He waited until every glass
was in the air level with his own. “Drink,
me boys, drink,” he cried—‘Damnation to
Jimmy Donovan !’ ”
Peter’s beer was half finished before he
noticed the ominous silence. Pie pulled the
mug away from his lips, and stared at the
astonished men, whose untouched glasses now
rested on the counter, or hung low in their
hands. Not one of them knew the dead man
personally, but he was known to them by
name from their fathers, among whom he had
lived and worked. The barman nervously
fingered the spirit bottles on the shelves
benind the bar, and watched Peter out
of the corner of his eye.
“Ha!” snorted Peter angrily. “You won’t
drink it, eh? Then be damned to the lot
of ye!” And he banged his mug down on
the counter, slopping its contents into a
frothy pool, and lurched out of the door. The
barman shifted the mug, rubbed a greasy
cloth over the beer-stain, deftly gathered up
Peter’s change and slipped it into a cigar-
box under the counter. And the drinkers
resumed their drinking with more talkative
fervor.
Two hours later it was a mostly hilarious
crew that gave the smiling doctor, a sick-
looking young policeman and a disgusted
J.P. a rousing send-off and then followed
the mortal remains of Jimmy Donovan up
the road past the school, where the scholars
at play clambered on to the wire fence to
view the uncommon spectacle. First came
the gloomy plumed hearse, the undertaker
black and erect under his shiny silk hat; im-
mediately following was the priest’s buggy
with its pair of high-spirited ponies pulling
hard on the reins; then, on foot, Bennett,
steadying Peter Thompson, followed by some
thirty men, their faces assuming a mock-
serious expression, and their stumbling foot-
steps making confused tracks in the dust
of the road.
Two hundred yards past the school the
funeral procession turned to the left into
the bush, and followed a seldom-used track
in and out among the trees, down a small
gully, and up a rise to the cemetery. The
graveyard was old and dilapidated. Many
of the early wooden memorials of past pio-
neers had rotted away. Some small stone
ones stood at drunken angles above unkempt
graves. Dry tussocks of grass dotted the area
with swaying, rustling, grey daubs. Outside
towered the dark ironbarks and the straight-
barrelled yellow-jacks, casting grotesque mov-
ing shadows over this home of the dead. A
jackass, perched on the rusty pulley-wheel
mounted on a rotting beam above a great
heap of gravel and clay just outside the
cemetery-gates, looked down into the crumb-
ln-g shaft below and chuckled mournfully.
Peter, acting-sexton, swung the two white
gates open, and alongside the priest, in sur-
plice and cassock, stalked solemnly down the
weed-covered drive to where the new grave
showed stark and yellow in a patch of
sunlight. Bennett selected six of the most
sober, and they lifted the coffin from the
hearse, and bore it with solemn footsteps
to rest above the gaping hole on two pickets
torn from a fence around an old family
grave. The others shuffled around and stood
in a semi-circle, staring gravely at the
coffin ; and the priest hastened to recite the
service for the burial of the dead. The under-
taker adjusted the long webbing bands under
the coffin, the pickets were pulled away, and
slowly four men lowered the casket.
Peter stood opposite the priest, directing
operations with his hands. “By crikey!” he
exclaimed wrathfully. “It’s stuck. How
long is the coffin?” he demanded of the under-
taker,
“Six foot six!”
“Didn’t Mr. Bennett tell you six feet? I
made the grave six foot three on the bottom
to be on the safe side; an’ now look.”
“Sssh !” admonished the undertaker. “It
was the only one I had in stock,” he wliis-
pered hoarsely—“couldn’t get another quick
enough.”
“Never mind, Peter,” said the priest;
“lengthen the grave afterwards.” He finished
the service and hurried away, for he had
a twenty-mile drive home and other urgent
engagements to fulfil. Bennett went with
him, and most of the crowd drifted back to
the hotel.
A few remained, and the coffin was raised
and put aside. Peter scrambled down into
the hole, and struck savage blows at the
end with his pick. Just as angrily he flung
the clods on to the heap above, and then
climbed up again.
“Have a drink, Peter. It’s hard work
that,” suggested a swaying friend holding out
a whisky-flask invitingly.
Peter lifted his hat, and wiped the sweat
from his brow with the hack of his arm.
Then lie reached out and gulped down the
spirit, drawing a long breath of satisfaction
as he handed it back.
For the second time the coffin was lowered,
and again it stuck, the foot this time being
about eighteen inches from the bottom of the
grave. With an oath Peter flung himself on
to the coffin, and stamped on the unoffending
timber.
“Come out of that, you fool,” ordered the
undertaker. “It’ll have to do. Shovel the
dirt in. He won’t know if he’s straight or
crooked. Shovel it in.” And he too departed,
Willing hands put Peter aside, and the clods
of earth were quickly tumbled down on the
untroubled human clay below,
When the mound was finished and patted
down neatly all around, Peter suddenly
roused himself from another pull at the
whisky, and, rushing from the shade, stamped
u p and down upon the sods. “And that’s
the end of Jimmy Donovan, hoys!” he
shouted.
There was a new car standing in front of
the hotel when Peter and his companions
came down the road talking and laughing.
Bennett met them at the side verandah gate,
and beckoned to Peter. “Here,” he said,
“Jimmy Donovan’s lawyer’s inside there, in
the parlor. He wants you.”
“Me?” questioned Peter, tapping himself
on the chest with his forefinger. “Me?” he
repeated in surprise. “What’s he want me
for?”
“Don’t know. Better go and see,” answered
Bennett shortly.
Peter straightened his shoulders, pulled
himself together, and followed Bennett along
the verandah for the second time that day.
Bennett pointed to an open door, and Peter
stepped inside.
Half an hour later Bennett found him
hunched on a seat just outside the parlor
door, staring in misery at something in
his hand. On the brick floor between his
feet lay a letter half out of an envelope,
"I hear poor old Jimmy left you every-
thing he had, Peter.” said Bennett cheerfully,
“About a couple of thousand. Some mate,
eh?” .
Peter stirred uneasily, and opened wide the
palm of his hand. Look. He pointed to
a gold locket that framed the faded photo-
of a young woman. That’s her. She
left Jimmy, too -after six months.” And
then the locket shut with a sudden snap,
as he looked up with despairing eyes. “He
asked me to forgive him, Jimmy did That’s
ae to tell you: Ask Peter to
f° r^7 e me ; P^ 01 ’ °bl mate, Jimmy.
And he choked, and his face dropped
between Ins shaking hands— I toasted him
to Hell, an stamped on his grave.”

The Sea-Eagles.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I.
WHERE the land slides into the sea
And is no longer land but reef and
shoal.
A wavering line divides uncertainly
Water from earth; and that’s my dangerous
goal:
Thither I journey by a paper road
Riding upon my pen, till I shall find
Somewhere hidden behind
Horizons of my mind
This the sea-eagles’ country, this the waves’
abode.
It is a strange, indefinite place:
No eye could trace
Where the division is, where it is air,
Where earth, where water. Even in calm
bays
Closer than bolt to socket ocean fits
Minutely into crevices everywhere,
Or runs out along tiny, jutting spits
Or pierces narrow slits.
No eye can tell
Where the upleaping waters conquer and
quell
New colonies, or where the wind has made
On some impetuous raid
Invasion of the ocean, ’ carrying sprays
As captives up the unseen passage-ways
Into the heart of space.
And sometimes I have thought:
“Only the water knows
Where its own boundary goes.
Some day it will forget
And will rise up to flood
City and plain and wood,
Then up beyond the snows
Till the last peak is caught
In a green hunting-net.
Not in an angry mood,
But puzzled and distraught
Because it cannot find
The limits it had set
In times gone from mind
To its own wanderings.
It will submerge mankind—
Merchants, beggars, kings.”
11.
Here’s the sea-eagles’ country;
there they hang
High in the dazzling air, and
there they sweep
On still wings over the disputed
place,
But far above the claimants, far
above
Crushed pebbles and torn spray
and ragged deep.
Faintly they hear the waves as
slow these move
Curling and breaking smoothly,
with calm grace,
But never touch the rocks nor
taste the tang
Of salty air such as the wind
hurls back
Where ponderous hills thrust
shoulders heavy and steep
Into the foaming wash, the
whirling wrack.
And they have always liung
there, always ridden
Upon the liquid sunlight like
great swimmers.
I think they breed there, that
their nest is hidden
On a gold cloudbank where the
sunrise glimmers;
Nay, that they never die, but
at the last
Sweep flaming through the sun-
set’s carmine portal.
Their wings still motionless and
poised and vast,
Royal.. . .immortal. ...
111.
I was a boy when I beheld them
first.
It was midsummer; and the day
Lace-like on cliff and headland
lay
In feathery hazes wherethrough
burst
The weather-ruined shrubs and
trees
That struggle on the barren
heights
To keep their foothold when the breeze
Blows bitterly from all the seas
To storm the land on arid winter nights.
I saw majestic rollers curl and smoke
And heard their thunder when they broke;
I watched them race with foaming lips
Such as have greedily mouthed poor luckless
ships;
I saw them tumbling to the shore
Through perilous shallows, and I heard the
stroke
That the land grimly bore.
High overhead —the very spirit of summer
Poised upon wings—the mighty eagles waited
To give me welcome, me the latest comer
To their broad, savage kingdom. On they
wheeled
Above the purple haze and took their way
With quiet strength unabated
Beyond my vision’s field
And where I could not follow.
Far out across a distant bay
To some spell-guarded hollow.
IV.
Ah! but perhaps I saw them earlier than
that.
Before time was or any life or thought:
Primal, unhurried eagles wheeling above the
darkness
Whence matter, time and distance would be
brought,
Wheeling in light above unquarried turmoil,
The first things made,
Surveying sombrely the undesigned to-
morrows,
Uncaring, unafraid.
The eagles wait for ever over the wavering
coastline
Because this place,
Being not land, nor air, nor deep sea-water,
Ts still their home in uncreated space;
Anil they, still wheeling, still the same
unhurried
Warders of chaos, guardians of the dawn,
Wait for the moment when the dark shall
swallow
The crowding worlds that once it sowed like
spawn.
V.
Or if not then I saw them when the world
was new,
Perhaps through Dampier’s eyes these
southern seas among,
Or in remoter times when cities were but
few.
When half the world was yet unknown and
half our songs unsung
And men lived closer to the earth, since
earth was blithe and young,
And being closer to the earth, closer to the
stars;
We had not lost our childish zest
For smashing prison bars,
But eager still for some new quest
We followed danger gaily,
And took our pay and earned our rest
Though Death was with us daily.
Color and action: these were ours:
Laurels and myrtles: wreaths and flowers.
As. free men bloodily we fought
For Liberty, and ever brought
Liberty with us to the field,
With fortunate Joy which could not yield. . . .
And Life...which yielded often enough—
For Life, though built of rugged stuff
(Nature and Courage), yet would feel
The falling mace, the biting steel.
Lungs like our own draw vital breath.
Our visions have not come to death;
In other hearts they triumph on.
Men do not change for good or ill;
And hearts Tike ours are living still. ...
The wild days nevertheless arc gone,
And gone the eagle's savage brood,
Barbaric drums that shook the wood,
Arrows and spears; and further still
Are clubs or empty hands that kill.
And our fierce loves and fiercer lusts.
THEY COULDN’T FOOL DAD.
PASSENCER: “Yes, that’s the South Head Light over there. It goes in and out every few seconds.”
DAD: “Yairs, but I’ll bet they don’t save much oil by that.”
Our villainies and dagger-thrusts,
All these are fled ;
And we are dead —
Unmoving geologic dusts.
And the first ships that clove the waves
Barnacles cover in deep caves.
Their masts are broken; and their planks
Are long since rotted, like their gear.
And cunning crabs witli naval ranks
Have manned them now for many a year.
Who. looking forth into the morning.
Would hope these days to see far out.
Tempests and unknown terrors scorning,
An open ship, a brave sea-scout,
Shields at the sides back from the bow
And flashing oars and white, wide wings?
She turns the foam up like a plough !
A shouting company of kings!
Why these have gone, who knows, or how?
There are no Vikings, though, no pirates
now.
VI.
The city street is filled with dust of noise:
Fragments of cracked-off sounds blown grit-
tily up
Into the life men drink from this vile cup—
A poisoned wine that chokes the throat and
cloys.
And other dust the demon town employs
To grind into its victims: actual grime
That smears their bodies, dust of cheating
gold,
The dust of shattered faiths they could not
hold,
And dust stirred by the wheels of speeding
time.
I know too well these dusts that soil the
heart.
Many a time in the great, hurrying mart
My mind was clogged with dust; I could
not see
What beauties yet remain, untouched, apart,
Such as the lights along the pavement-ways,
Bright dresses, and gay girls, and masonry
Defying solidly the vanishing days.
VII.
We, like the world, have grown
Beyond what we have known
And have outlived our clearer, simpler youth,
Though for a while I cheat
Time with a vain deceit
Of flowing words and fancy strong as truth.
Not enough are fancy and words;
I must go out again to see
Tn very fact those fatal birds
Whose images are haunting me—
Birds of flesh and beak and feather,
Actual monarchs of air,
Real, and hovering there
High in the gleaming weather.
Not enough it is
Thus by a song to have brought
Dreams out of the past,
Shadowy images,
Conjured shapes of a thought
Soon to be overcast —
Soon thrust
Under the city dust.

ROBERT D. FITZ GERALD.
Horse Hunting.
[FOR THE BULLTIEN.]
HORSE HUNTING in the Australian
bush is most times a wearyin’, back-
achin’, dog-garn business—a pursuit
to put your eyesight to a sharper test ’n any
specialist could make, and fit you for runnin’
long periods at high speed on an empty
stomach. For tryin’ out your knowledge
of busheraft and the habits of the horse
as learned by that super-animal in the School
of Nature, or for showin’ up what a poor
dud you are, who ought to be back in
the nursery or runnin’ round tli’ smelly city
collectin’ orders for mouse-traps, there is
nothing anywhere to compare with it.
Let’s say your stage is set on an area
of Government lands, where mountain ranges
and great green scrubs seem to stretch and
roll away to the end of the world: you'll
want a pretty accurate knowledge of the
entrance and exit places, and be able to
take your cues from the sun and the scenery
’fore takin’ to horse-huntin’ in them theatres,
The game doesn’t stand for dare-devil dashing
down mountain sides, or through jungles of
myall an’ brigalow and vine scrubs with a
long knife in your hand. Enough of all that
and perhaps more than enough’ll come when
the hunting is over, an’ the hunting can’t be
over till you’ve spied your horses. And say,
for illustration, that a brown mare with a
white foot who strayed or was stolen from
you three Christmases before has suddenly
come to light again, bein’ seen a couple of
days recent by Mountain Jim runnin’ with
other horses of all kinds of brands, some
with none, away down on the head of Dingo
Creek, all of ’em gone wild as Hell! There’s
no doubt the mare’s your lost property. Moun-
tain Jim read your brand on her—T2D on
th’ near shoulder—and Mountain Jim never
falls over the brand on a horse, though once
or twice he went near failin’ over the
mounted police. She’s fat as a forced hog,
has grown a long mane out there, an’ her
tail is sw'eepin’ th’ ground. That’s Brown
Lady for sure—eight years old now—that
you wouldn’t have taken twenty guineas for
at the time that someone took her for less
than the asking. And someone, maybe, who
was sorer in need of a smart mount than
you was yourself.
So in a flash-back Brown Lady has come
right into your life again, which was more
than she might have done if she was a
woman. You get broodin’ and figurin’, and
she goes down on your stock-list again as a
homestead chattel. She’s a windfall, and
already you see two buds on your income-
tax where only one was sproutin’. Though
you’re in a soft bed in a fair good home
you don’t sleep near so sound that night as
the cattle-dog who’s outside on half a cow-
hide. Because you’re goin’ to ride out first
thing in the morning, soon as the milkm s
finished, to the head of Dingo Creek, and
hunt for Brown Lady—that’s why. Your mind
is workin’, calculatin’ your chances of findin
her an’ bringin’ her home. You’ll have
thought out a scheme by which you ve
caught her and lost her again several tunes
over long before the last fiyin’-fox has left
your strugglin’ orchard, which is most his
orchard, anyway, and then you'll want to
indulge your imagination some more on the
financial aspect of her before dozing right
off.
Though you don’t get more than forty
winks you'll be the first out and about the
homestead, and everything’ll be goin’ different
with you. The old milk-cows that’s been
al’ays agreeable to just stand in the bails
chewin’ cud while you pulled their teats and
stripped them dry, sayin’ nothing, only press-
ing your head into their flanks, are all rest-
less and tryin’ to squint round the bail-post
at you. They can’t make out why you’re
whistlin’ and liummin’, and on your account
get upset and can’t let all their milk down.
Th’ missus, who was excited when the news
was brought about Brown Lady, begins now
to let the barometer drop. She wonders if
the mare is worth the bother and worry of
losing a day from the homestead to hunt for
her, and wishes you had engaged Gumleaf,
the half-caste, for the job. And all the time
that her barometer is droppin’ she’ll be slicing
away at the bread-loaf and the corned round
on the breakfast-table, putting up a parcel
of sandwiches for you. She’s known you
to go horse-hunting before, and remembers
how you came home with the moon —tired,
stiff, bad-tempered and dog-hungry. So she
adds bits of cheese and plugs of cake and a
few more sandwiches to the parcel till the
lot, when it’s wrapped up, bulges out like
a bull-pup who’s stolen all the Christmas
butter. A parcel of sandwiches that gives
points to an over-fed bull-pup isn’t likely to
find accommodation in a saddle-pouch in com-
fort ; so in a sweating hurry you undo the
parcel and discard the cheese and the cake
and crumple the Illustrated News around
the sandwiches again, as if they
was gone bad, and off out with
’em ; and, callin’ back over your
shoulder not to expect you home
before sundown, you make for
the stable.
’Most every out-back Aus-
tralian homesteader has at least
one good horse who is a loyal
mate of liis. A sound, good-
tempered, tractable animal,
broad of forehead, bright of eye,
wide of nostril, deep-chested,
hard-hoofed and swift as the
eagle. You’ll possess such a
one; a well-set, clean-limbed,
kindly beast called Greygown.
Ilis reputation was made on
the cattle-camps, and he’s
known to horsemen far out on
the great grey plains of the
West. For it doesn’t follow that
because a homesteader ain’t yet
made his pile he doesn’t own a
top-notch stock-horse that’s in
good form and condition. By
instinct and intelligence Grey-
gown gets you this morning that
there’s to be a big day, with
something to account for at the
end. If there’s been any doubt
in his mind it’s gone when you
cross the homestead boundary
and head for the steep, blue
mountain range, where the
white cliffs glisten and the
peaks are poking out through
the early morning mist. Leanin’
forward as he swings along,
strong as a lion under you.
you’ll clasp his glossy neck
with your arms and talk joy-
ously into his ear, telling him
what you’re expecting of him.
And while you echo your
thoughts to him, of Brown Lady
and Dingo Creek, he’ll keep at
the canter without canoodling
with the direction. Some horses,
like humans, when you’ve a
tough job on for ’em, don’t
seem to know the way to it
and show no more sense of
direction than a barndoor fowl.
So just to put yourself sure of
him bein’ up to concert-pitch,
you’ll sit up in the saddle, take
a short hold of him, and, givin’ him the
urge, will let him out on top gear for a
couple o’ hundred yards where th’ goin is
good and level. You’ll be content, before
you can steady him down again and the
rataplan of them hoofs of Ins has gone out
of your ears, that once he gets a sight
of Brown Lady her days of wandenn
in the wilder: ess at sweet will 11 be num-
bered.
There’ll be eight mile o’ forest to throw
behind you before coinin’ into full view of
Red-gum Gap. wliich’ll be the only pass you
know' of to take you through those rock
walls: then down the range on to the head
of Dingo Creek. Other passes there’ll be,
but the secret and safety of ’em. or other-
wise, ’ll be known only to the marsupials an'
wild dogs. Away from all that, however,
you’ll not be out on any exploration stunts
for the benefit of migration liang-arounds and
city umps who come behind. You’ll be on a’
errand that’s profit an’ loss, and lookin’ a
sight more like profit than loss,
Goin’ through Red-gum Gap you’ll ease
up to pick your way. an’ you an’ Grey-
gown’ll be thinkin’ in telepathy, keepin’ your
eyes out for rock-slides an’ earth slips that
might let y’ down over bumpy precipices
where there’s no Red Cross to take care of
casualties. Just the actual goin’ through
won’t be one of the seven wonders, of course;
but goin’ down to what’s below’ll be seven
wonders all in itself.. There’ll be tracks to
follow if you want to, numbers of them; but
only the Lord could say for sure where any
of ’em’ll lead you to if you follow them with
anything like the faith you follow your reli-
gion’, for example—unless you’re a politician,
’Way down under will be panoramas of God s
own Australian scenery rollin’ before you
like ocean waves and extendin’ farther than
you’ll be able to look. Above it all will he
eagles lookin’ like sparrows, with spread-out
wings soarin’ round cuttin’ the figure eight,
with their heads tucked under on the look-
out for somethin’ dead, or somethin’ livin'


but helpless to swoop down on an’ slay! A
noble bird is the eagle; he comes next to the
crow.
But the scenery or the eagles won’t take
up much of your thoughts for long, knowin’
they’ll be in sentimental and safe hands.
You’ll want to be done with sliidderin’ and
feelin’ giddy ; you’ll want to be gettin’ down
on to Dingo without a broken neck. So you’ll
sit well back in the saddle and slash at th’
scented wattle boughs for wantin’ to blind
you and smother you an’ chloroform y’ all
at the one time. And when Greygown starts
progressiu’ on all fours without ever movin’
a muscle, an’ pullin’ up where there’s a bit
of footin’, with a grunt and his hind hoofs
jambed against his front ones while his
rump’ll be sittin’ back agen a wall of loose
soil, you’ll first try to think of your prayers,
in which you never was word-perfect, and
then you’ll feel glad and thankful because
you’ll know he’s come to the end of a sec-
tion, and is only takin’ a breather ’fore
lookin’ to see if it’s wise to change bearin’s.
Picking his wav down that range, sidlin’
and slidin’ with list, on his back, takes it
out of a horse no matter how good or clever
he might be; —an’ it takes it out of a man,
too. Just how much it’s jarrin’ his shoulder-
blades you won’t quite know till one day
you’ll feel him movin’ tender and proppy
when canterin’ ’long a road. Then some
other day, without gettin’ any warning, you’ll
find him hitting the ground a wallop for
no reason at all that you can see. You’re
in too big of a hurry, anyway, rollin’ yourself
clear of him and the saddle, to see any-
thing. After that he’ll be gone in the
shoulders.
But you’ll be down the range now; so,
recognisin’ old landmarks and figurin’ the
lay of the land, you'll conclude that the
head of Dingo Creek is on the next gorge,
a couple o’ mile across. The head of most
creeks that start in the ranges have as many
branches to them as a fig-tree, and all of
them sandwiched in spurs and ridges and
layers of rock. And it’s only by the water
that you can tell which of them is the real
creek. So now you’ll start horse-hunting in
earnest. You’ll be on the look-out up and
down on both sides of you, and straight
ahead. Your optics’ll search every openin’
and streak of daylight that shows through
the forest; you’ll scan the side of every ridge,
and follow the shallow gullies. You won’t
think of puttin’ Greygown out of a walk, but
he’ll be steppin’ it out brisk and cautious
from gully to gully and ridge to ridge; his
ears’ll be pricked and he’ll be watcliin’ for
horses —nothin’ else. When a prowlin’
goanna scurries his hardest for a tree, or a
pair of gazellas leave cover and bound off to
get out of reach, he won’t appear to see
them. Not even an old-man kangaroo that’s
meditatin’ under a tree on the vanishin’ of his
tribe since all manner of bushmen took to
carryin’ rifles, and suddenly rises up to his
full height and stares at you more in terror
than ferocity—not even that will take his
attention. It’s horses he keeps lookin’ for.
THE COST OF POPULARITY.
PEGGY: “And how’s your fiancee nowadays, Hubert?”
HUBERT: “Rotten! Hates me like poison. If I DON'T
marry her she’ll sue me for breach of promise; and
as soon as we ARE married she’ll start to divorce me.”
Along a new-worn track are some rounds
of tell-tale horse-dung—dropped there not
longer than yesterday or the day before,
You’ll know they’ll be pretty fresh because
the big blue flies are still interested. Grey-
o-own’s quick eye’ll take it in. and he’ll know
all that it means and you’ll feel him give
a bit of a jump. You’ll run that gully up to
a dead end, and come back along it again,
It’s years, perhaps, since you’ve seen such
Ion 0- green grass—if you could only shift it
to the homestead! But it’s not for performin’
miracles vou’ll be riding about that country of
deep ravines, terrible gorges and wallaby
brush So vou’ll keep on making for this
hill and the next one, looking over into
sheltered nooks and hollows, the likely-looking
haunts for horses.
All the while you’re sort of conscious of
the feel of a stockwhip in your right hand,
\t intervals it touches your right foot. It’ll
be company in a way for you. and so far
vou won’t have cracked it. or flicked it at
■i o-oanna wrigarlin’ up a tree, or even at a
silTy butterfly that’s cornin’ flutterin’ to meet
you. All tiie time your left hand’ll be
workin the bridle-reins automatic-like. Not
that Greygown’ll want such guiding, though
there’ll be differences between you now and
again, but it’ll keep you in harmony with
each other, like, your hand pressed light on
the waist of a good partner’ll make her wise
to the way you want her to fox-trot through
a crowd and keep you movin’ as one.
Presently you’ll edge round a belt of
vine scrub to peer over into a hollow like
the land of Canaan that Moses was shown,
where there’ll be a cleared patch and a
Moreton Bay fig spreading its branches in
the middle of it. For some reason —not that
you’ll want to get down and sleep under it,
or have an idea of hanging yourself on a
limb of it —you’ll make for that fig. You’ll
be right near to it, throwing glances up at
the dense foliage where the fruit is yellow-
ripe, and parrots are trapezin’ and screamin’
for the sheer joy of being parrots, when sud-
denly an animal that’s been dozing behind
the trunk’ll swing away from it, nearly
tumbling over himself with fright. Greygown,
too, ’ll get such a surprise that he'll bound
back, then feel ashamed on seeing what it
was startled him. For there, staring at you
with a pair of dim, sunken eyes, liis head
covered with brush seed and fallen wattle-
bloom, is a poor old horse little more than
a bag of bones! His old tail, that nearly
all the hair has fallen out of, tries to go up
in the air as the spirit of other days comes
back to him, and he’ll show a will to snort
at you for intrudin’. Instead, he capitu-
lates and nickers a friendly greeting to Grey-
gown. You’ll look the old chap over, amused
and curious. His back has sunk in like the
roof of a deserted shed; his
withers and hip bones are stick-
ing up like the steeples of a
church; the color of him has
faded; his head’ll seem to be
the biggest part of him; and
yet, though he’ll be a dog-garn
scarecrow, you’ll see he’s got
the frame of what was once a
well-made moke. You’ll figure
him a good old has-been; and
while you contemplate him he’ll turn round,
and his brand’ll catch your eye. Then you'll
take the name of the Lord in vain in utterin’
your surprise. “Old Bandolier —Harry Gro-
gan’s stock-horse !” And you’ll nearly let fall
some tears. Then your brain’ll be flooded
with memories of that old skeleton before
you, pensioned off, waiting for the last call!
“Poor old Bandolier !” You can’t help being
soft-hearted, for you’ll be thinking of the
times you saw him carrying Harry Grogan to
the head of stampeding mobs an’ wheelin’
them —and of what lie looks like standin’
there now! So you’ll speak to him at last
as if he was a man, calling him by name.
Wakin’ up, quick, on the sound of it, the
old chap’ll think it’s Harry again, and’ll
whinny to you with a sort of lump in his
windpipe. “So long, old fellow!” There’ll
be a lump in your throat, as you’ll be
leavin’ him, for, after all, a horse is a
horse. But when you’ll look back, before the
forest closes behind you, old Bandolier’ll be
gazing pathetic after you,
and may be in them dim
eyes there’ll be a couple
of big tears, for a horse
when the end is near can
feel lonely ’way out there
as well as a man.
It’ll be gone about two
o’clock now, and you’ll
hit a trail that’s tattooed
with prints of liorse-
hoofs, and your heart'll
jump. You’re on the
track of the mob at last!
You’ll run that trail
down off the high ground
in a hurry, knowing it’ll
lead to the water. You’ll
know, too, there’ll be a
good chance to drop on
them there about that
time if the mob isn’t in
the habit of watering at
streak o’ day and making
back to high ground to
graze. Apart from them,
Greygown is looking
pretty hollow, and you’ll
be feeling a gnawing and
emptiness at the stomach
yourself, for it’ll seem
nearer twenty-four hours
than eight since you
rushed down that break-
fast.
Just as you figured,
that trail, after leading
you down off a long spur
where all the small
stones’ll be kicked off,
will take you to the water
—'a big long hole, deep
and blue and clear right
to the bottom; it'll make
you feel it was meant for
mermaids and gold-fish to
live in, not for horses and
wild beasts to drink and
muck round. There’ll be
oaks and cedar - trees
shading the top side of
it, where it’ll be walled
in by a rock cliff, and
you’ll see the blue sky
and the moon shining
up at you. You’ll gaze long into it,
thinking how you’d like to have it, too, at
the homestead, and dropping out of the
saddle you’ll invite Greygown to quench his
thirst before getting down on your stomach
to it yourself. The thirst that’ll be on
you would be worth a couple of florins to a
city dope inhabiting a lounge bar. Grey-
gown, with sweat dried and caked on his
flanks and chest and shoulders, ’ll stretch out
and shove his nose right under, with a foot
of the bridle-reins as well; and he’ll make
more noise over it in his hurry to take all
lie wants before the hole goes dry than a
tableful of harvesters would make over then-
soup. Of course, you won’t let him take all
he wants; you’ll call time, and lead him off
to the shade of a tree, high up, well out of the
way, where he can nibble at the grass while
you take the sandwiches out of the pouch,
feeling certain that the missus was right,
after all. about the appetite you’d have, and
you find now that the cheese and cake
wouldn’t be in the way. After accounting
for the crumbs you’ll be lying there in the
shade, propped up on your elbow, lookm
down on the waterhole, and dreaming. The
girths’ll be slackened, and Greygown’ll be
cropping away at the grass, now and again
stamping his foot down hard to let the silly
ants that'll be worrying him know the weight
of it. You’ll have taken your hat off; the
cool breeze’ll be fanning the heat out of
your forehead, and there’ll be a feeling of
THE ONE THING HE MISSED.
CLUB PORTER (to homing drunk ): “Hat,
overcoat, stick, and gloves. Have you
got everything, sir?”
SOZZIED ONE: “Yesh, everyshink, exshep’
(hie) ’scushe for zher wife.”
peace and contentment come over you. Grey-
gown’ll stop cropping tlie grass. His. head’ll
go up, sudden, like a railway signal, and’ll
stop up. You’ll know lie’s got something in
his eye, and you’ll be on to your feet quick and
standing at his head. It’ll be no false alarm.
Greygown’ll lift his head an inch higher.
His eyes won’t move. Then there’ll be a
string of horses winding steadily down oft
the long spur to the other side of the water-
hole. Their heads’ll be drooping, and
they’ll be watching the trail. Greygown’ll
put more power into that stare of his, and
his tail’ll start lifting unbeknownst to him.
You’ll stare too, drawing quick, short breaths,
then you’ll tighten the girths quicker than
you slackened them. Down’ll come the horses,
one on the heels of the other—one, two, three,
four; you’ll count up to twenty, nearly all
bays and browns; but there’ll be a grey and
a roan amongst them, and one’s a cripple, a
bay thing that's had its shoulder frac-
tured by a rifle bullet, or a sapling, long
enough ago.
Now they’re lifting their heads and you
can see they’re wild as hawks. Some of
them are scarred from their jaws to their
tails where they bumped the timber or
tumbled into rock gullies in a mad hurry
to keep clear of their enemy—man. Nearer
and nearer they’ll be coming to the water,
and Greygown’ll begin to get excited and
start champin’ the bit. Your eye’ll settle
on the second last one —a clean-limbed,
superior-looking animal —and your heart’ll
give a jump and start beating in your throat.
That clean-limbed one’ll be Brown Lady,
chummed up with that wild, darn lot o’
nondescripts, got be chance.
A couple of moves from the edge of the
water the one in the lead, a wily old mare
too flash to have any more foals, ’ll stop
to look about with her eye full o’ caution.
The others’ll follow suit. None o’ them’ll
see Greygown or you because you’ll be
higher up, and the tree shade’ll keep you
from being conspicuous. Everything’ll seem
0.K., and so into the water they’ll splash,
knee deep. Under’ll go their snouts, they’ll
all be in line; their necks outstretched, takin’
in water like a line o’ pumps. The roan
one, who’ll have drawn number eight or
ten marble, ’ll be hurling it down so fast
that he’ll have to pause for breath. And
while his head is lifted, and mouthfuls tinged
green with chewed grass’ll be dribbling back,
you and Greygown’ll move, and come right
into his picture. Laws, he’ll have seen the
Devil for sure! His head’ll fly round over the
backs of the others and his body’ll try to fol-
low in a frantic hurry to get out of the rank
and off. His mad plunges’ll strike terror into
all o’ them and the noise they’ll make falling
over themselves in that water and churnin
it up’ll outdo a steam-boat crawfishing off
a sandbank. They’ll all get out wet all
over, and plunge up the bank after the
roan, who’s led the way. Then they’ll stand
well back holding their heads high, their
tails up, taking sniffs at the air, and staring
in every direction —except yours.
But the roan blighter, he’ll be starin’ in
wild astonishment straight across the hole
at you. A lanky-legged filly that’ll never
have been in a yard’ll let go a snort, and
give a gallery-trot round, planting her feet
down like a dancing-girl giving an exhibition.
Then 'an old brumby-mare’ll lower her head
and give it a shake, indicating her belief
that it’s all a hoax, and’ll start jauntily
back to the water. Most of the others 11
start following her. But that roan’ll nearly
take a fit. With his eyes still on you hell
let off three snorts like an engine blowing ott
steam, and fly round in a way that 11 make
those others, Brown Lady included, scatter
earth and stones about, and bump each
other, and get their legs tangled up like
worms in a tin, in their haste to retreat
again.
All the time you’ll be figurin’ what’ll be
your best plan of getting Brown Lady. To
try to run such a mad mob single-handed
in that country’ll mean mighty hard gal-
loping, and perhaps crippling a good horse
—and then not getting her. So the only
tactic left to you’ll be to take to her as
if you’d come down out of the clouds to
race her oft - the earth, leaving all the others
slide.
You’ll he on to Greygown then in a jump.
They’ll all spot you before you’ll have reached
the saddle, and Lawd! how they’ll stam-
pede, crashing and cracking the timber like
lightning banging and ripping it up. Grey-
gown’ll seem right-down glad to be after
them. He’ll take the dry part of the creek
in a bound, springing like a marsupial, and
up and over the bank. And now you’ll haye
to prove yourself. You’ll be crouchin’ In
the saddle, your hands light on the reins,
the stockwhip hanging from your arm, when
Greygown in the wake of them’ll cut; them
all down and rattle in amongst the bunch.
You’ll be a bomb-shell that’ll put panic into
them. Like kangaroos when the dogs get
amongst them they’ll scatter and go for
their lives in twos and threes. You’ll have
Brown Lady set in a glance, and you’ll be
at her, shouting, yelling as if you hated her
and was out to head her on to the biggest
tree standing and watch her break her neck.
Now it’s only Greygown and her for it.
She’s got breeding and was wonderful fast
before she went bush ; still, you’ll know that,
with all things equal, a horse in the saddle
is too many for one that’s free. But
she’ll have advantages in that broken coun-
try, and commences right off to show you
a point. She’ll know the tableland that’s
grown over with black wattle —dt’s the refuge
of wild horses —and she’ll decide on getting
to it. You’ll be pressing her, and she’s
coming to a belt of cursed wallaby brush.
There’ll be a track through the brush which
she’ll know of. It’ll lead up to the tableland
of black wattle. She’ll hit the track square
and vamoose into the brush. You’ll hit the
brush in a dense part, crashing into it, and
coming out on the other side without your
hat. most of your shirt ripped away, and
bruises and scratches all over you. You’ll
have lost sight of Brown Lady. But in
rounding a brace of washaways she’ll be
on view* again, doubling to it like a grey-
hound, the hot steam blowing from her nos-
trils. You’ll send Greygown at the brace
of washaways to short-cut her. It’ll be reck-
less ; but he’ll clear them. Blundering at
the second one, he’ll he at her again—worry-
ing her till she changes her mind on the
last turn of the trail to the tableland, and.
wheeling suddenly, ’ll make down for a
stretch of level country on the creek. Grey-
gown’ll wheel with her, and down the slopes
thev’ll rattle it out.
Now you’ll remember you’ve got the stock-
whip on your arm. If you can get near
her to loop the double of it round her neck
you’ll know 7 she’ll think of the catching-rope
she was choked down with when being
broken, and won’t fight against it. Horses
don’t forget the touch of a catching-rope on
their necks. It comes back to them like
the touch of a vanished hand. You’ll see
the clear, open level ahead: then you’ll
fumble with the whip while they’ll be
carving it out stride for stride. You’ll press
your heels harder to Greygown. He’ll stretch
to the feel of them. Brown Lady’ll be
heading a straight course. He’ll draw on
her, and draw on her. His head’ll come
up to her flank; then to her shoulder; then
level with hers. And then you’ll hang across,
shove the double of the whip over her neck,
slick, slip the handle and the thong through
the double, and leaning back in the saddle
you’ll pull her with one hand and handle
Grevgown with the other. In a hundred
yards they’ll both be slowing down together,
and Brown Lady’ll he thinking of the
catching-rope.
Next thing she’ll be standing, trembling,
and blowung like a bellows, while you hop
off, convert the whip into a halter and
* * * *
You’ll be riding for hours under the moon
that night, and when th’ missus, pacing th’
verandah since supper-time with baby in
her arms listening for sounds of horse hooves,
calls out. “Is that you, .Tim —have you got
Brown Lady?” you’ll reckon it’s you all
right.
STEELE RUDD.


Home.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YV/HEN I die my soul will go
Homing to the land I know;
For that strip of narrow earth
Holds for me the whole world’s worth.
Overlong I’ve been away.
“Home!” I’ll whisper—“ Home to stay!”
Swiftly then my soul will seek
All the grandeur of the bleak
Little rugged land of mine,
Where the wind is wet with wine,
And beneath the cloud-flecked dome
Every rood of it is home.
There my yearning soul will see
Mountains of white majesty ;
Feel the keen, unwearied wind
Through the singing tussocks thinned,
And shall hear ’neath birches tall
Chuckle of a waterfall.
In the lush green bush remote
I shall hear the liquid note
Of the tui, drop by drop,
And upon a discord stop;
Practising his son? again,
Still he chokes liis. harsh refrain.
'Neatli a branch-embroidered sky,
Through the bracken shoulder-high
I shall wander in the noon
Listening to the lulling croon
Of the water, drip by drip,
Seeking my companionship.
From the gullies will be lent
Wafts of memories—-the scent
Of the flax and bracken green,
Busli-glades filled with perfume keen,
And the miles and miles across,
Honey-sweet with golden gorse.
Wide expanse of plain and hill,
With the old Alps watching, will
Welcome me; and blue-gum trees
On the plain will paint a frieze,
With a skylark, heaven-higli,
Pelting music from the sky.
Eagerly I shall go back
To the muddy old bush track
Shadowed by the tree-ferns tall.
With the robins’ frightened call,
And the children in the cool
Riding bare-back from the school.
Almost have forgotten been
Flax-leaves’ bayonets of green
And the regiments of pomp
Of the raupo in the swamp,
With a cabbage-tree grotesque,
Like an eastern arabesque.
I shall seek out each by each
Every tarn with sandy beach
And the hidden lakes among
Where I played when I was young,
And the gorges taciturn
Shadowed by the gaunt cliffs stern.
Every silver shingle reach
Has a haunting song to teach,
And the granite ridges roar
As the swirling torrents pour
Over cataracts of foam—
These, all these, have called me home!
NOT AT ALL A NICE PLACE FOR A WRECK.
SHIPWRECKED SADIE: “George, this is going to be a hateful place. My nose is freckled
already.”
Ever-changing is the scene ;
Spring-time changes grey to green;
Poplars set the plains afire;
Oak-trees are an autumn pyre.
Seasons with God’s colors play—
England is not far away!
Overlong I’ve been away;
Now my soul comes home to stay;
Though I’ve wandered far and far,
Still she shines for me, a star.
Life has sundered us apart—
Now my homeland holds my heart.
N.s.w.
ARIHUR H. ADAMS.
The Ghosts of Brogan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]1
“NrOU may be right,” said Jacobs dubi-
ously, “but I can’t see it. He'
doesn’t seem to me to have a single
human instinct.”
Williams tamped the glowing bowl of his
pipe reflectively. He was slow in thought
and speech as well as in movement.
“Maybe you’re right,” he said. “I can’t
say that I like him. There’s nothing like-
able about him—yet. But there will be,
you 11 see. I reckon I have been handling men
lou ? enough now to know one when I see him,
and this chaps darned good material, lies
young yet, and all he knoivs is work. He’s
stung by this new-fangled efficiency stunt.
But lie’ll wake up some day and see that
there’s more to a man than the SAveat he
" “ofl
™ , ,iiS'Toe” e dOCS ' be “ m “ ™
“Maybe.”" Jacobs was far from con-
vinced. “But what I want to know is, what’s
going to happen to Brogan in the process?”
Williams was silent. This was a question
which he had been evading.
Brogan, in old Edwards’s time, had been
a good place to Avork on. Edwards was one
of the old sc hool—a capable, practical stock-
man, Avitli a fist like iron, the Devil’s oavii
temper, and a flow of language which Avas
the terror and envy of his teamsters. Yet
bis men liked him, and stuck to him. His
temper was merely a pose—the bark of the
o ld watch-dog—-and behind it Avas a nature
four-square and all Avliite.
He uever ovenvorked his men, and he was
seldom in a hurry when there was need
for haste he didn l have to drive them. Slioav
them tne urgency, and he was a man avlio could
keep up to them. Apart, therefore, from
the rush seasons times were easy. He
b'elie.ved in carrying full staff the year round,
and j le held to his opinion stubbornly in spite
0 f opposition from the economy-loving head
office down south. Only his own trained
men, he held, could muster Brogan clean ;
and his musters bore out so thoroughly the
Avisdom of his contention that the head office
ceded him his staff. Most of his men, from
Williams, the overseer, down, were old and
bad long periods of service on the place. They
Avere men of his own breed; good men every
onc 0 f them; not fast, perhaps, but thor-
-oUgh, and, above all things, trustworthy.
Edwards was old—his connection with
Brogan ran to half a century—and for the
past ye ar he had been failing. Consequently
it w as no surprise to anybody when the com-
pany retired him at the end of the drought.
Tooth and nail he had fought it; fought Avith
the dogged, unyielding persistence with
Avliich he had fought its predecessors for half
a century. He had emerged victorious, but
tired.
Everyone had hoped that Williams would
get the management. He had been overseer
on Brogan for 30 years. Had they but
realised it, this in itself was the strongest
reason Avliy he should not get it. You can’t
put in a spell of service of the kind his
was without receiving more than one offer
of management during the period. Wil-
liams had had scores—both from his own
company and from others—but he wasn’t
built for it. He was a stockman pure and
simple. Financial responsibility and the
thousand and one cares of management Avor-
ried him. There are hundreds of his type
in the bush ; splendid men in every way,
but to whom a man on top is essential.
Responsibility, with none to share it, would
kill them in a month. In many cases they
are the actual managers, the puppet in the
office merely giving the final seal of autho-
rity to the thing which they propose—the
seal they shirk and cannot give.
So the company sent Peters up. Peters
was one of those born-genius chaps whom
nothing can keep down. He had joined the
company as a jackeroo at eighteen; at twenty
he was overseer; now, at barely twenty-four,
they put him into Brogan. His record got him
the job; that and his economy. He had no
influence.
From the first there was no doubt as
to his making good—the man was a machine,
a tireless, nerveless, automaton of relentless
efficiency. Equally there was no doubt of
the change in Brogan. Peters’s motto was
“One hundred per cent, on the job all the
time.” “Stone” Peters they had christened
him at Numra, the place he got his overseer-
ship on. and the name had stuck. It suited
him. He was hard and cold, inside and
out. Even in his jackerooing days he had
never been popular. He didn’t drink —it
impaired efficiency. He didn’t join in the
skylarking, simply because he was obsessed
with his one blinding passion for work. He
never relaxed; never became human. Yet
he had his good qualities. He was patient
and civil, and less even-tempered than of
no temper whatever. And he feared neither
man nor beast. Even this saving qualify
could not make him more than tolerated,
however.
He came at a slack time, just after shear-
ing, and by the end of the first week every
man on Brogan realised that the great
change had come. His method was direct,
THE CONNOISSEUR.
“And so you go to school, now, Timmy?”
‘“Aw, yairs.”
“And do you love your teacher, darling?”
"Pooh! No fear! She’s not a bit my style!”
forcible, yet left no loophole for complaint.
The first morning he asked Williams
what the men were doing. “Just poking
about amongst the stock,” was the reply.
Peters said nothing, but caught a horse
and rode out alone. He came back about
sundown and sent for Williams.
“I noticed,” he said, “a lot of things that
want doing. There are sucker-growths on
all the fences. Get the men out to-morrow
and have the stuff cut off, and have the fences
cleared ten feet at the same time. I believe
in cleared fences for roads and fire-breaks.”
“But the teamsters are still carting wool,”
Williams reminded him. (These jobs in
Edwards’s time had always been done by the
teamsters, the black-
smith and casual
hands. The stockmen,
he held, had enough to
do to look after the
stock and ride the
fences.)
“You’ve got plenty
of men here,” Peters
told him. “Get that
crowd out of the huts
and the jackeroos out
on it. It’ll be good
exercise for them. The
boundary - riders out-
side can give a hand,
too, as the work gets
round to their fences.”
Of course, the men
were sore. They had
had, as usual, the
worst time of anyone
during shearing, and
they hadn’t seen the
huts or had a Sunday
for two months. This contract meant at
least another two months camped out. Wil-
liams, in response to a direct hint, went
with them, and liked it no more than they.
The third day Peters rode up and watched
them for a few minutes. Then he got off,
borrowed an axe, and started in. He made
the pace a cracker all that day, and didn’t
knock off until nearly dark. He knocked
up three of the jackeroos, and the old men,
not being in trim for axework, felt the strain
badly.
The next day, and the next, he came out
in the car first thing in the morning, and
worked with them all day. He didn’t com-
plain ; he didn’t interfere. He simply drove
them by his own example. And they fol-
lowed —as he knew they would.
They finished the fences, and he turned
them on to the bore-drains and had them
cleared. That done, he kept them cutting
burr on the stock-routes until it was time to
put the rams in. Nor was this the only
field of his activities. From the office down,
110 department was spared. Jacobs, the book-
keeper, had to discard his neat and spidery
hand-written correspondence in favor of a
typewriter, which he didn’t understand and
which kept him up until all hours of the
night laboriously picking out letters. The
correspondence, too, doubled and trebled,
and the filing system Peters introduced —
there had never been one before —nearly
drove the old man mad. The blacksmith found
himself with enough heretofore discarded
gear to keep him busy for twelve months.
The teams were put on delving, cleaning
tanks, making fire-breaks: anything he could
find in the way of hard work. Even the
cowboy he gave two paddocks to ride.
He himself worked hardest of all, so tjiat
none could find a word to say against him.
They could only submit to being driven;
and driven they rvere. From daylight to
dark the fierce pace never relaxed. They
were old, and by the time the rams went
in the continual tear at fever heat was
telling its tale.
Things really started from that muster.
First of all, Peters disagreed with the way
in which the paddocks were handled, and
introduced a more scientific system of his
own.
“The way you’ve been mustering,” he
told Williams, “is against the configuration
01 the country. This way you should be
able to go over most of the paddocks a
second time where before you only went
once.”
Williams said nothing, but the muster was
a failure. The old way of handling the
paddocks had been evolved by Edwards and
Williams from a close study of the habils
of the Brogan stock, and it paid better than
the configuration of the country. Williams
had generally sent a man out the day
before, too, to see where the stock were
running. This Peters stigmatised as waste
of time and unnecessary.
Tney got the worst muster they had had for
years, and the air was stormy.
Peters, though he could not, of course,
join the camp, formed the habit of riding
about the paddocks, which made everyone
uncomfortable. Then one day, cruising about
as usual behind the musiterers, he found sheep
on old Joe Bryan’s beat. When he got to
the camp at mid-day he sacked Joe.
Things looked bad. Joe had twenty years
on the station to his credit, and had always
been known as a good man. Of course, he
was getting old, and maybe his eyesight
wasn’t as good as it had been ; but he had a
smart dog that wasn’t likely to let him miss
much. Nobody doubted that the sheep
had come in on to his beat behind him —
which may happen to the best of musterers.
Everyone reckoned that it was because the
muster had been a failure and Peters wanted
an excuse to shake things up. That is, every-
one did except Williams. He watched Peters
narrowly, and, as he told Jacobs afterwards,
he failed to see a trace of elation or satis-
faction. “No,” he added, “he’s come up to
scratch again, hang him. I hate him drop-
ping Joe, but, all the same, I can’t help admir-
ing the way he did it. There was nothing
personal in it. He simply reckoned it was
Ins job, and he went through with it more
justly and fairly than I ever could. I tell
you he’s a man, and the making of a darned
good one too, when he finds the human half
of him that’s missing.”
“I got my doubts,” Jacobs replied scepti-
cally, “but if you’re right then the sooner the
‘submerged half’ gets afloat the better. Other-
wise,” he added significantly, “there’ll be
precious few of us here to see it.”
Later events seemed to prove him right.
After the muster one of the periodic
retrenchment pleas came up from head office.
Peters showed it to Williams. It was the
first he had received.
Williams read it through, and tossed it
on the table contemptuously. “Same old
cry!” he said. “I thought one was about
due now.”
“Do you mean to say,” asked Peters, “that
these letters have come up here before?”
Williams glanced at him suspiciously,
“in Edwards’s time,” he said deliberately,
“they came up every three or four months
as regularly as the seasons. And they went
where they belong—into the waste-paper
basket.”
“But the company!” objected Peters in
amazement. “Did they stand that sort of
thing?”
A illiams smiled. “You’ll find the com-
pany’ll stand a good deal when they know
they’ve got a good man,” lie said. “Besides,
there’s really nothing in it. Some idiot with
a retrenchment bee brings it up at a direc-
tors’ meeting, or running costs increase a bit.
and that’s the result. They’ve got sense
enough to see, though, that a man or two
more or less on the books is small beans
compared with the dividends and musters
a man like Edwards shows; and if he makes
a point of it they’ll give in every time rather
than risk losing him.”
“I see,” said Peters, quietly. “Of course,
it all depends upon the point of view. In

T is the East which appeals so strongly
to travellers and particularly to Austra-
lians. And there is no land more typical
of the East at its best than Ceylon. With
its gorgeous scenery and luxuriant
tropical vegetation, its palm-fringed shores, its ancient

my opinion the company is right. We are
overstaffed. In fact, I may tell you that
even without this letter I had every inten-
tion of retrenching as soon as I’ve got the
place into decent order.”
Williams leant forward in his chair. He
had an impulse to go over and put his
hand on Peters’s shoulder and say, “For
God’s sake, don’t do it. lad.” What the
result would have been will never be known,
One look at the hard, confident face of the
younger man stifled the impulse as soon as
it was born. He rose and turned his back,
When he spoke, without turning round, his
manner was curt, his voice curiously tone-
OH, THESE BROTHERS!
Dorkik: “I shall marry whatever man I please — there!”
Brother Bill: “Well, have it y’r own way. All the same, / liate to think of you as
an old maid.”
less. “Have you decided yet wlio you’re
paying off?”
“Practically.” Peter’s voice was calm—
inhumanly so, it seemed to Williams. For
an instant his faith in the man wavered.
“Time enough, though, to go into that later.”
There it was again—that damned efficiency!
He was afraid some rumor of it might leak
out, and make them less willing during their
last days! Williams ground his teeth as he
stumped heavily out. How little this young-
ster knew or understood these men ! Then
a sudden access of rage possessed him, and
he cursed this cub manager ; cursed him for a
soulless fool; him and the company whose
word to him was law. And then he prayed.
Not as the good know prayer, but a fierce, bitter
prayer, demanding that this wrecker should
learn in time of the deeper things in life;
of the values that lie above the mere sordid
piling-up of gains; of the service that
transcends all recompense and leaves man
ever debtor unto man. His world —the world
he knew—was falling, and he saw himself
falling with it; sinking down amid the shad-
ows of a great anu splendid past.
Shortly after this, Frank Hews developed
one of his periodic thirsts. His, of course,
was no isolated case. The majority of old
bushmen must have their yearly or bi-yearly
spree though tne heavens fall. Nearly all the
Brogan hands were the same, and Edwards,
with the innate sympathy of one not alto-
gether free from the suspicion of being a
fellow-sufferer, had borne with them. He
had cursed their going and cursed their
returning. And he had cursed still more as
with rough skill he nursed them back to
sanity and a workable condition through,
and over, the subsequent d.t.’s.
Not so Peters. Drink was anathema to
him. He could not understand these men,
or feel with them as Williams could. He
told him bluntly that if any man went he
went for good. “I’ve little time for drunks,”
he said, “and less to waste on nursing them
after they come back. If they turn up ready
for work, well and good ; if not, then they go.”
“You’ll have to sack most of them, then,”
said Williams grimly.
“That’s as may be,” was the ominous
reply. “I’m not at all sure the place
wouldn’t be the better for a new mustering
staff.”
That night he showed Williams the list
of those whom he intended to pay off. There
were six; six of the oldest and longest-
serviee men on Brogan.
Williams read the list through in silence,
reached into his pocket for a pencil, moist-
ened the point, and added his own name.
He passed it to Jacobs, who, rather to
Williams’s surprise, also added his before
returning it to Peters.
“You mean this?” he asked Williams
sharply.
“I can’t bluff.” was the slow reply.
Peters was silent for some time. He real-
ised that affairs had taken a serious turn. To
get rid of half a dozen old men was a differ-
ent matter to losing the company’s best over-
seer and a long-trusted book-keeper, and he
realised that the view taken of it by head
office would be vastly different. In fact,
there was no absolute certainty that he could
“get away with it.”
“I was going,” he said finally, “to give
these men notice to-night; but, perhaps, in
the face of this, it would be better to wait.
Of course, the whole thing could be settled
from the head office; but as three of the
directors are coming up shortly on a visit of
inspection I think a better plan would be to
wait until then. That will save any mis-
understanding, and both sides will get a fair
hearing.”
“I agree,” said Williams simply. He real-
ised, and even old Jacobs had to own, that
this was more than fair. In a correspondence
with the head office, and without the under-
standing of the position which a study of
the conditions on the spot would give, it was
obvious that Peters would have a tremendous
advantage. That he should forego it was
another proof to Williams that his faith in
the man was justified.
They kept the affair a close secret. Wil-
liams persuaded old Frank to forego his
spree for the time-—no easy task this, but
there were few things these men would refuse
him.
So matters lay until the directors arrived.
Two of them were city men; the third, the
oldest, a one-time cattle man.
In the office on the third night after their
arrival, in the presence of Williams and
Jacobs, Peters laid the matter before them,
simply, barely and justly.
When he had finished, the oldest director
turned to Williams. “This,” he said, “seems
rather an extraordinary attitude on your part,
Williams. Are we to take it that your
resignation is simply an effort on your part
to defy the authority of the manager?”
Williams shook his head. “No,” he said.
It isn’t. I’ve got nothing against Mr.
Peters, and I don’t want to interfere in the
working of the place in any way. I’m simply
keeping a promise I made to myself.” He
paused ; then in response to a look of inquiry
went on: “I’ve been on Brogan altogether
30 years. During that time I’ve seen stations
all around change from the old days and the
old ways. I’ve seen them turn from big,
happy families, bound together with a hun-
dred ties, to soulless, money-mad machines.
But I’ve never been on one of those. I’m
too old now to change, and I promised my-
self long ago that when Brogan went the
way of the rest I’d leave. That’s all.”
The youngest director tipped the ash off
his cigar and leant back in his chair. “It
seems to me,” he said, “that Mr. Williams —
and Mr. Peters, too, for that matter—is
making a considerable fuss over a very little
thing. The oosition, as I take it, is simple
enough. If these old men aren’t competent
to do the then we must get others in
their place. We can’t let sentiment inter-
fere with business.”
There was a moment’s silence. Then
Williams rose slowly to his feet and towered
over the group at the table.
“I take it, then,” he said quietly, “that
my resignation is accepted?” The three
directors stirred restlessly, but nobody spoke.
“I’ll be sorry to leave Brogan,” he went
on after a pause, “but glad that I
won’t be here to see it change. For”—he
glanced at the youngest director —“I don’t
agree with you. I don’t think a station can
be run like a machine, for one thing—especi-
ally one of the age of Brogan, and with its
traditions. And for another, if you can’t
let sentiment interfere with business, then. I
say. to hell with business! I’m an old man,
and I don’t pretend to know these things.
No doubt you’re right. But,” he added, turn-
ing to Peters, “wdiat I do know, and what
you don’t, is what Brogan means to these
men. and what these men mean to Brogan. I
was here before you were weaned —and these
men were here too. Can we be blamed if
we look on you as an interloper? As a
destroyer of all that is best in our lives?
What do you know- of this place? What do
you know of the blood and sweat, the toil
and hardships of these men that have gone
into its building? For you can’t build sta-
tions like businesses—though you may run
’em like that now. They’re built of human
lives. There’s no ‘cog in a machine’ about
them. Every man you’re going to fire has
put more into the nlace than the company
can ever pay. Do you imagine their wages
pay them for what they’ve done? Blood
and sweat, health, youth and vigor these men
have given to the building up of Brogan.
Do you imagine they did it for their miser-
able screw? Do you think you can buy
allegiance such as these men have given this
place? Go out and try.... But I forgot.
Y'ou are trying. And I tell you that before
the year is out you’ll be looking in vain for
loyalty, or willingness, or conscience in the
flash youngsters you’ll stack the place with;
aye, and you’ll be cursing the day you drove
the old men out of Brogan. Your youngsters
will work all right; perhaps they’ll even
stand up to the pace you set —while you’re
looking on. But will you be able to trust
them as I can trust any of these men here?
To leave them a week or a month or a year,
and still know that every beast under their
care is getting the same treatment as if
you were there, or better? Again, I say,
perhaps they’ll stand your pace. More likely
they’ll tell you to go to blazes and get a
crowd of blacks! These old chaps can't
stand it; but they’ll try—yes, and you know
it, for you trade on it. You’re killing them,
but, by God, even you’ll admit they’re dying
game!
“And yet you talk about dismissing them
for incompetence! Them! Why, man,
they’ve forgotten more about this game than
you’ll ever know! They can’t stand your
modern hustle now; but I’ve seen the time
when every man of tnem’d kill you in half
a day! And why can’t they stand it now?
Because they’ve given their life-blood to the
place, just as they’ve risked their lives for
it, times over;, just as others of them have
given their lives..’.. Did you ever,” he
leant forward, suddenly tense and menacing,
towering over Peters, “go over to the sand-
hill at the back of the house? Ever see the
mounds and slabs there? Eight of them
there are. Did you realise what they stood
for? Eight lives given for Brogan. Man,
I tell you you might as well deny those the
space they occupy as drive these others from
the place they hold! Those found death;
these risked it just as often !
“You’ll tell me that it’s all in the day’s
work; that you run the same risks yourself
and think nothing of it. True, and I’d be
the last to suggest that every man who
runs the ordinary station risks should be
guaranteed a home for evermore on that
account. But that isn't these men’s claim.
These are smart men, competent men, men
whom any station would be proud of —as
long as you let them take their time. And
more than that.” He plucked the list from
the table before the younger man. “Every
man on this list has a separate claim on
Brogan; a claim that no duty can cover,
and that the company can never repay.
There’s no currency in some things.
“Frank Hews! You were going to sack
him the other day because he wanted to go
for a spree. What knowledge have you of
the ways and wants of such a man as
Frank? lie’s a diffierent species; one
of a different world. I remember the
day he came over here, 25 years ago. He
was over six feet then. lie doesn’t look it
now. That was before he got the rheumatic
fever which has left him almost crippled
ever since. And how did he get it? Saving
two thousand Brogan sheep in the 1910
flood! He was camped on an island for a
week, never dry, and his only tucker meat
grilled over a wet fire. He could have swum
his horse out any time, but he’d , have had
to leave the sheep. So lie stayed. He’d
do the same again if it happened to-morrow
—and if he knew you were going to sack
him next week it wouldn’t make the slight-
est difference. All the bushmen aren’t gone
yet, thank God! It took him a week to

—and Brogan. And they never asked or
got a penny extra for it.
“You call them drunken! Maybe they
drink. Maybe they need to. But tliey can

sake of the place. Chances are that if they
hadn’t done so in the ’Ol drought Brogan
would be in other hands by now which

draw. Do you mean to say they didn’t want
a spree in all that time? Do you mean to
say they didn’t realise that at any moment
we might go smash and their wages be lost?
Were these men working for money then, or
can money repay their work? They believed
in us, and they trusted Brogan. And their
work and their wages pulled us through.”
Williams paused and swung a look at
the four men in front of him. He was car-
ried away—beside himself. The room was
very still. “And now,” he said, and his
voice rang out harsh and bitter, “because
I won’t stay to see that trust repaid, to
see the last fortress of the old generous days
crumble before the march of the modern
business machine —because I won’t prove
traitor to the ghosts and memories of
Brogan, but choose to go out with the rest
of my breed, you have the damned and
hideous cheek to ask me if I’m trying to
defy the authority of the manager!”
He sat down heavily in a silence that
could be felt. The oldest director sat for-
ward in his chair, liis hand shading liis
eyes. Twenty years of traffic and bargain-
ing slipped away, and the ghosts of a long-
dead past crowded about him. Once more
lie saw with the bushmen’s eyes; his hand
clenched on an imaginary rein, and his
knees tingled to a strange, new-old longing
for the feel of a horse’s straining sides.
On either side of him the city directors
sat silent and very still. For once the sor-
didness and the dross had been stripped
away, and they grappled with great realities;
glimpsed the life of this man whose presence
seemed to fill the room more poignantly than
had his voice. (Or was it, perhaps, the crowd-
ing ghosts of Brogan?) Their own lives and
souls were suddenly revealed to them, and
comparisons were illuminating and humiliat-
ing.
Peters sat staring, unseeing, at the paper
in front of him. On his face was the look
of a man suddenly awakened. For him
there was no shell of ignorance to mitigate
the revelation. He saw in a blinding flash
—and every word of Williams hammered
it home with devastating force —what manner
of trust was this which had been given into
his hands. Ho saw the network of toil and
sweat and danger, of courage, sacrifice and
devotion which had gone to the making of
this place, which was woven into its very
fibres. Saw and shuddered at his responsi-
bility. The shudder seemed to rouse him,
and recognition dawned in the eyes staring
at the paper. It was head-office’s letter
of retrenchment. He snatched it up and
crumpled it savagely in the ball of his hand.
But before he could rise the oldest direc-
tor, roused by the noise, had forestalled him.
lie rose, reached across and took the letter,
smoothed it out and glanced at it. Then
slowly, deliberately, he tore it across and
again across. “I move, gentlemen,” he said,
and his voice was curiously soft and deep,
“that the staff of Brogan remain as at
present constituted.”
“Carried,” said his two colleagues in one
breath.
* * * *
Late that night Williams, returning from
the store, saw a figure moving in the moon-
light towards the sandhill. Silently he fol-
lowed. From behind a tree, when he arrived
there, he could see the tall silhouette of
Peters before the little cluster of graves.
Peters stood still, his head bent upon
his breast. Suddenly he straightened and
looked around. His hand moved slowly
upward to his forehead in an unconscious,
curiously pathetic gesture; semi-reverence,
nemi-salute; dropped to his side again. Then
he turned and strode to the house.
Williams watched his retreating back till
it vanished amongst the Then he. too,
turned towards the graves. “A hundred pet
cent, man,” he muttered. “A hundred per
cent, man.”

The Masterpiece.
[For The Bulletin.]
WE were sitting in the bar-parlor of
Fenton’s pub after a few days’ duck-
shooting up north, Stansfield, Orr
and I.
Stansfield, a disgruntled newspaper man,
was talking of the dead-grey level of our
modern literature, and the need for a new
shining genius.
“Looks as if we haven’t got it,” he said,
knocking a pipe against his heel. “Genius
will always out. It’ll burst through some-
how.’'
“Possibly there is good stuff written that
the Avorld never sees,” said Orr thoughtfully.
A fussy little man, Orr, with a school-
inspector’s job behind him. “Who knows
Avliat significant outpourings have had their
beginnings in some lonely out-back spot? To
go up in smoke, perhaps.”
“Good for you, old boy,” I thought, but I
said nothing, sitting back and listening to
the swish of pepper-boughs on the roof and
the little intimate noises of a country
pub.
So I sat back and thought, until I could
see again the big-boned form of David Jef-
fries, Avith its loose-hanging clothes, his
broAvn hair that stuck up on top in a queer,
coarse whorl, and his perpetual air of being
lost and expecting someone to find him a
way out. And I saw Rosalie
May, with that fragile, elusive
essence of her that was like the
beauty of a white tree in blos-
som, and the lissom figure that
had earned her a place in the
front row of many a musical-
comedy ballet.
It was on a windy spring
morning that she burst in upon
my untidy upstairs office—that
man’s place with its smell of
ink, and papers, and smoke.
“What have you done with
David V” she demanded breath-
lessly.
We looked at each other over
the table, and my eyes hardened.
I realised for the first time what
an unequal light it was going to
be tor the boy we loved —she for
his body and soul, I for his
genius.
“Sit down,” I said, and she
sat gingerly, her waole body
quivering under the thin silk she
wore, her darkened eyes never
leaving my face.
“And now?” she said with
that odd little bird-trill in her
voice.
I looked at her calmly and
impersonally, as a man of fifty-
seven may look at an attractive
girl of twenty-three. “I have
sent David away,” I said, “to a
quiet place where he can work
in peace and get back what he
has lost. A few years ago, as
you know, Rosalie, he gave pro-
mise of genius. Only a few
stories, and a play that was a
nnancial failure. But every-
thing lie wrote bore the unmis-
takable sign. Since then, what
has he done ? Nothing ! Drib-
bled away a tiny income,
mucked round with women—
especially one woman”
“Meaning me,” said Rosalie
with her aloof grey eyes staring.
“You needn’t be delicate.”
“Meaning you,” I agreed im-
perturbably. “You would seem
to have strangled effectually
every inspiration except the
more or less necessary one of
love.” I spoke drily, and I
looked down at the " blotting
paper, because 1 felt that her
face had suddenly lit up. "I
love that boy. It is almost as if
I have seen in him the burnt-
out fires of my own poor powers kindled
again. I banked all on him, told him that I
would make it my business to push on any
thing that he produced. Last week I sent
him away. It’s a lonely little bush township
on the Gippsland coast. I spent a summer
there once. A tiny, uncomfortable shack,
but the local hotel will serve him with neces-
saries and the place is alive with game. He
has a gun and a physical appetite. Genius
requires food when it is young. He left
fired with enthusiasm.”
“You would t°ke him away from me!”
hurst out Rosalie, and her eyes blazed in
her white, oval face. She was the primitive
woman now, ready to fight tooth and nail
for her man.
“You must leave him alone,” I barked. “A
year at least.”
“I may not even write?” she asked stonily,
and I told myself with some disquiet that I
had never seen such a look on any woman’s
face before. It was as though she looked out
and beheld her world in ruins before her.
With David gone her very existence had
ceased. I wondered for the moment how I
dared assume the position of mighty judge
and arbiter, and set intellectual accomplish-
ment beyond all human affection.
She clenched her badly-gloved hands in a
passion of grief.
“You do not understand,” she moaned. “I
have no life apart from his. Look what I
have missed! He would have married me,
but I made him wait. I wanted it to be per-
fection when it came. And now !”
She Avas incoherent. Her words ran on
bitter-sweet and meaningless. Her agony ran
deep down into me, as I watched the door
furtively, praying that no one would come
in.
, “You may write,” I said at length, grudg-
ingly. I gave her the address, which she
snatched from me. “You understand! Play
fair !”
She kissed my hands sickeningly and pro-
mised, her eyes raised to the ceiling.
But I had reckoned without David him-
self. Two months later a letter came.
“Old sport,” DaA T id Avrote, “I’ve not done
a stroke. Women are the devil, as you have
remarked frequently. They’re a drug, and a
man Avho has been used to a drug is helpless
without. If I had Rosalie here !”
I felt sick Avith disgust and apprehension.
In the wake of the letter came Rosalie, radi-
ant in a pink frock that was a challenge in
itself.
“I’m going to live with David,” she trilled.
“He wants me.”
I asked her if she had thought of what
people Avould say—of the primitive arrange-
ments in that out-back place—everything.
“Nothing matters,” she said triumphantly.
“No one Avill know where I am. I’m out of
a shop at present, but I’ll tell the landlady
that I’m in the chorus of a country troupe.
Pouf! I shall disappear. I will not be
noticed. I am nothing !”
I felt curiously defeated as she turned and
waved an airy kiss, the little silver bag at
her wrist jangling like sleigh-bells.
David’s letters came at intervals through
the summer. They were the letters of a
happy man. He said that they fished to-
gether, swam and walked ; that the sea was
like blue-bells mirrored in ice; all sorts of
foolishness. He wrote of Rosalie. Rosalie
was Avonderful. “In the night she sews, with
her shining black head bent over some absurd
sewing, and I work. But I don’t seem to
have struck anything Avorth while yet.” In
later letters I sensed the vague unhappiness
of a man with a bitter hunger that would
not be appeased. That was a good sign,
I considered. But at the same time I had
a queer premonition of trouble. I resolved
WHEN FATHER DOES A JOB.
tliat I would •go down and see things for
myself.
On a windless autumn day I left Mel-
bourne for Swallow’s Hollow. It was a
long journey, made up of interminable waits,
and ending with a rattling coach and a
monosyllabic coachman. As I came out of
the dark forest within sound of the sullen
sea, dusk lay over the Hollow, and I had
the impression that I had left the world
behind.
I went straight across to the shack, a lean-
ing structure at the side of slim, wind-
battered gums. There was a woman near the
door. She was chopping wood laboriously
and inexpertly, her hair falling into her eyes.
I watched her push it back impatiently, and
raise the axe again doggedly.
“Rosalie!” I said doubtfully, as I went
over the soggy ground.
She turned, and I saw the fear that was
in her thin, tanned face.
“I’ve only come to see you and David for
a night,” I laughed.
She smiled with relief, and pointed to the
door. I went inside. It was smoky there.
The stove drew badly. The walls were un-
lined, and the rain had trickled through,
making fantastically-outlined maps on the
greenish boards. The furniture had been
made of boxes, and there was a rough couch
in one corner. David got up from this as
I burst in, big and boyish and brown, with
the same mad whorl of hair on the top of
his head, the same whimsical air of a lost
child.
“Old John!” he cried with obvious de-
light. “I say, sit down !”
We talked while Rosalie cooked a dinner
at the stove, her eyes red-rimmed and
watery from the smoke. But there was some-
thing different in David. Some of the vital
essence of him was gone. He seemed jumpy
and anxious.
“Cooks for me as though I were a big
chief,” he said. “Spoils me.” And I could
have hit him for the smug satisfaction in
his voice.
During the meal —stewed rabbit —her eyes
never left his face. David seemed oblivious,
though once when her hand touched his Avith
deliberate intent I caught a look of irrita-
tion, and Avhat Avas almost a flare of hate,
in his dark eyes.
“You’ve done nothing, boy!” I said re-
proachfully.
“Nothing but achieve happiness,” lie said,
giving a glance at the Avoman, who flushed
Avith delight. “We lived out of doors all
the summer. I had a few ideas, but they
Avere gone before I could capture them. ’
He put his collar up because the wind was
blowing through the cracks, and Rosalie
started up quivering, and thrust another stick
of wood on. “I’ll write in bed now.”
Our conversation was curiously futile. It
was as though we skirted round what we
most wanted to say, David and I. Reason-
ably early the two of them retired to the
inner room, Rosalie with a Madonna look
on her face and a guttering candle in her
hand. And I slept badly on the couch in
the corner.
“Get it done,” I shouted to him as I went
out to the coach next morning. “I’ve pinned
everything on you. Don’t let me down at
fifty-seven!”
“During the Avinter,” he muttered irrit-
ably. “Long nights. Long nights !”
Rosalie was hanging on his arm, but he
Avas quite unconscious of it. I had the feel-
ing that as soon as I was gone she would
heave a sigh of infinite relief. Amazing little
Avoman Avith her immense capacity for lov-
ing ! She was his drudge, his slave, yet she
was richly content.
During the winter I
heard occasionally
from David. He never
mentioned Rosalie. I
pictured him living in
Hell, struggling to
express what was in
him, beaten always by
the allure of the
woman who held him
against his will Avith
the implacable tyranny
of her nearness. Pic-
tured their tempestuous
passions hate and
love, and hate again, a
vicious circle.
At the end of the
winter, after a long
silence, word came. It was an incoherent
letter, barely decipherable. “The thing is
done,” he wrote. “It is a novel. I feel
that I have written finis with the last drain
of blood in me. Come and see.”
I smiled at the imperious summons, but
went. On this second journey it was more
difficult to get through. It was bitterly cold,
and the sea when we came out near Swal-
low’s Hollow was the color of stone. I was
appalled by the stark ugliness of winter
there. It was like looking at a withered old
woman destitute of clothing.
Crossing the hollow. I went up to the
shack. David was sitting brooding in front
of the fire. There was a wild light in his
eyes as he turned round.
“It's great, old John!” he whispered, run-
ning his hands through his hair.
“I know,” I said, and I promptly went
back to the little pub on the headland, and
brought food and bottles for a celebration.
“Where’s Rosalie?” I asked later, when
I could keep quiet no longer.
“Oh, she’s gone,” he said flatly. Then he
looked at me with a whimsical look. “Women
are the very devil, as you’ve often remarked.”
I nodded, wondering, yet relieved at her
absence. He was averse to my seeing the
manuscript that night, so I went off to bed
early, and shivered wakefully till near morn-
ing under the inadequate rugs.
Next morning we walked out on the windy
headland. David did not appear to be listen-
ing when I talked.
“Funny effect the sea,” he said once, lean-
ing over' the smoking surf. “It calls like
a woman, don’t you think?” .
“I suppose so,” I said impatiently. Rut
my imagination is atrophied now.”
'He gave me the rough typescript of his
book that night, and went off to bed, leaving
me alone. I began to read with avidity.
I had not read many sentences before I
perceived that he had taken Swallow s llol-
low for the setting. The hero of the piece
was David himself. Here he was a psychic
surgeon dissecting his soul pitilessly. I got
a clear picture of a man torn between the
physical need of a woman and a clamorous
hunger for self-expression. I saw them liv-
ing there through that dark winter, the two
of them, felt something of the terror and
bitterness and the despairing passions that
had surged in that Avind-swept shack. I saw
Rosalie, with the sheer young beauty of a
white-blossoming tree, clinging to him like
a lost thing—Rosalie May, whose only
faculty was loving.
With the sea-wind drumming the window
I read on to the slow, inevitable unfolding
of tragedy. It terrified me, this thing. It
was superlative genius. The wind dropped,
and in the sullen silence that followed I
clenched my fist as if I strung myself against
a blow. I read how David had wearied of
the unequal struggle, hoiv Rosalie’s lure
had made him mad, and he had killed her
Avith a piece of green sapling that had lain
by the stove.. He described the journey
down to the sea, with the slight body in his
arms growing heavier and heavier, and his
last act of throwing it heavily-weighted in
a dark sea-pool.
“The sea —it calls like a woman, don’t you
think?” I heard him say, and I remembered
liis eyes.
I burst through the mesh of horror that
enveloped me, and Avent into the inner room.
He was getting up off the bed, and smiled
at me naively.
“Great, isn’t it?” he asked me, with a
cunning, sidelong look.
“Man, you killed her!” I gasped. “Rosalie!
My God!” , .
“I knew you’d 'deduce that,’ lie said
quietly. He sat rocking, his torn shirt hang-
ing over his pyjama trousers, his hands
covering his eyes.
“I had to do it,” he whispered crazily. _ I
couldn’t work. She would come and twine
her arms round my neck every time I took
a pen in my hand. I hated her—hated her
and loved her. My brain went blank one
night. I killed her—from behind. She didn t
know. I carried her down to the . sea—
dear little Rosalie, with her black hair and
eyes like grey water. No one will ever
know.”
I rustled the papers in my hand, and swore
at his blindness.
“You’ve written your death-warrant here,”
I said. “No one knowing you and Rosalie
would read this and not question. There
was a cousin of hers, a paper fellow, asking
about her the other day. No, by God !”
I felt suddenly aghast at what I was about
to do.
With his torn pyjamas flapping about him,
he followed me into the other room. I
groaned as I flung the white mass, of papers
in the fire, and they went up in sudden,
glorious flame. I felt that I was murdering
the soul of genius there.
“I shall never write again,” screamed
David. He leaped on me, and I saw his mad
eyes, but I was ready for him.
He left with me next day, obeying me
with the unquestioning obedience of a child,
when I outlined a programme for him.
I saw him off on the boat a week later.
He stood on the deck, looking down at me
Avith a brooding resentment under his tremu-
lous smile. I had saved his life, perhaps,
but I had destroyed that which had made
his life worth having! He could not forget.
I never saw him again. Someone is. said
to li ave come across him in the Argentine a
few years ago. He may be dead now.
$ $ #
The face of David was still with me as
I looked across the bar-parlor at Fenton s
pub. . . . . .
Orr w T as still whittling away at his sub-
ject.
“By the way, I often wonder what be-
came of that young Jeffries,” he said rumin-
atingly. “Bright youngster who never justified
his early promise. He ought to have written
a masterpiece!”
“Perhaps he did,” said Stansfield cynic-
ally. “One of those hypothetical master-
pieces of yours! The kind that never see
the light of day.” He looked across at me
with a knowing look in his pouched eyes.
‘‘That pretty girl Rosalie May disappeared
somewhere about the same time, according
to a cousin of hers —reporter on the Star.
Perhaps they are together now somewhere,
laughing at the futility of noble futures,
when present love can be had at such little
cost.” ,
“Perhaps,” I agreed vaguely, and I signed,
thinking of Rosalie May Avith that fragile,
elusße essence of her that was like the
beauty of a white tree in blossom.

Would be thinkiir you're a lady,
An’ showin’ me my place;
You with your ruddled mouth.
An’ the dye-stuff on your hair—
Is it you would be talkin’, then,
To an ould woman there?
You to speak of modesty! —_
An’ I’ve known you standin’ bare,
Nothin’ on your naked back
But a little twist of hair;
All them painter fellas round —
Not a body there but men—
Is it you that would be talkin’
To the ould woman, then !
With your two-dimensioned world,
Measured up in sex and money,
A lot of help you’d give a man
In times that weren’t sunny !
An’ if his touch had lost the thrill
Ye’d strip him down, bone-bare,
And leave him —broken-hearted —
An’ you’d go without a care!
Why, the ould skin on your face,

Bristol Town.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DIVERSE the craft that drew to berth
What time the centuries sped by:
High Roman prows by slaves oared in ;
Frail coracles to ships ally.
Invaders stark, and fair and dark.
Have swarmed the Channel at their will;
Have conquered men and maids in spite
Of lightning sword and fleshing bill.
O sailor sons of seamen bred
In north fiords and southern bays!
O fighting spawn of fighters led
Across pirating water-ways!
Bristol Town! Bristol Town!
0 ships sail out to far renown!
O ships sail out, and crews go down,
And hearts heat sore in Bristol Town!
Diverse the traffic of the town
What time the years and years fled round :
Came kings in state, by arms held safe ;
Came monks afoot, in gospel bound;
And rolling stones that grew not moss,
But live the hour the minutes bring;
Came all the pomps that beauty leads,
The flotsam that sets hawks awing.
O soldier sons of soldiers bred
In highland glens and lowland plains!
O fighting spawn of fighters led
Through northern mists and southern rains !
Bristol Town! Bristol Town!
Crusaders rode icith visors down;
Crusading youth, hy sword or gown,
Along the roads to Bristol Town!
And still the breed finds its way home:
From Anzac came the youngest blood
Across the furthest leagues of sea
To fend its port from alien flood.
Their feet have walked its olden road :
Their eyes have seen its highest spire;
Its famous dead, who loved its ways,
Have lit their souls with high desire.
O younger sons of soldiers bred
In highland glen and lowland plains!
O fighting spawn of fighters led
Through northern mists and southern
rains!
Bristol Town! Bristol Town!
Our sons have walked, icith helmets down—
Crusading youth, in tunics brown —
Along the roads of Bristol Town.
On their long tramp to Bristol Town
Quick march the ships from wave to wave:
And Bristol sons, in steadfast haste,
Tread, day by day, their fathers’ grave.
The Channel lights guide them well home ;
The pilot craft guard well their way:
And down to welcome back their brave
Come —who can say? Ah! Who can say?
O sailor sons of seamen bred
In north fiords and southern bays!
O fighting spawn of fighters led
Across world-old pirating ways!
Bristol Town! Bristol Town!
O ships sail in from far renown!
0 ships sail in: the crowds go down,
And hearts beat high in Bristol Town!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TOM LONELY’S fine store at the top of
Brazier-street looks down upon a ’Loo
that is not the ’Loo of other years.
Most of the broken streets are mended now,
and an abundance of paint has changed those
that are not. But it is still a slightly sullen,
watchful place, lazy and secret as hereto-
EVEN AUNTIE COULDN’T DO IT.
“I’ve had. such a bit of luck! My aunt has promised to meet the whole of my
obligations.”
“But, dear, she can’t marry ALL the men you’re engaged to.”
fore; Tom, who knows practically every-
thing between William-street and the docks,
knows also that the paint and the mending
have made no real difference. Clifford
Mimbles doesn’t sit on the gate of the coal-
yard on Sunday mornings now. perhaps; but
that. is a concession more to the fact that
Cliff is married and a father than to the
irritating slick prosperity of his view from
the gate. Spiky Stott still works in the
bookshop, unconscious of any radical change
in the ’Loo; and Coaly Mimbles, Clift's
young brother, has gone up country and
doesn’t care what the ’.Loo looks like.
On this Sunday morning it looked dead.
That is, it looked dead everywhere but in
Mrs. Wales’s place in Palmer-street. On
week-days this was a laundry ; but on Sun-
day mornings it was, up to 10 o’clock, a
battlefield. At 10 o'clock all the Waleses
departed for Newport; and presently that
dusty, lazy, careless peace descended upon
Palmer-street once more. Mrs. Wales, in the
conduct of both her laundry and her house-
hold, was an arbitrary woman; her self-
imposed duty drove her to spend every Sun-
day with her mother and father at Newport,
and, further, to drive her family before her.
The raucous clatter of this duty with its
attendant unlovely details of half-completed
toilet and bullied weeping children made the
battlefield effect. No neighbor was quite
certain where Air. Wales was; but on Sun-
day mornings Palmer-street in bulk agreed
that if it was Long Bay or even Bathurst he
was lucky.
The old man sitting in the kitchen looked
up as Airs. AYales’s completed head came
angrily into the doorway. A diffident, half-
terrified smile flickered into his eyes.
“Now look, Aloonier,” she told him,
“there’s a bit o’ cold beef in the safe —not
much, but it’ll do your appetite. If it don’t,”
she menaced him. “there’s a bit o’ rabbit at
the back o’ the top shelf.”
“Merci, madamc ” — AI. Meunier’s hands
flashed out in deprecation, “you trouble too
much.”
“Well, yer must eat, mustn’t yer, and I
shan’t be ’ere to wait on you ’and an’ foot,
shall I? You know where the tea an’ sugar
is, an’ ”
“Carm on, mum,” a voice called from the
passage. “It’s gone ten.”
“Shut up, Guy; I'm puttin’ yer grandfer
right for the day. Now look, Aloonier —don’t
leave the ’ouse and don’t let anyone in.
Liz an’ me’ll clean up to-night when we get
home. All you got to do is to smoke yer
pipe an’ get yer grub.”
The tide of instructions flowed over the old
man’s head as it had flowed, it seemed, for
millions of Sundays. Presently the tide
ceased and the strident clamor fulminated to
the banging of the door. This was the last
shot, heralding the lazy peace. For all this
day now Alonsieur Adolphe Guy Meunier
was alone.
He sighed and looked round the room,
seeming to come to life in the blessed silence.
Causelessly, a vision of his mother's kitchen
in Rouen crossed his memory—the deep wide
fireplace, the stone floor that was so cold in
winter, old Eugenie stooping over the fire.
For a moment memory possessed him. He
saw the notary’s office under the brow of the
cathedral and himself a pupil there in a
high-waisted coat. 60 years ago. He saw
Uncle Jacques’s farm and a blushing dream
of beauty under an apple-tree in bloom, as
she, too, was in bloom. He saw the gradual
ruin of the years that followed, the departure
of his son for Australia, the death of the
dream of beauty. The bleak ruin had closed
round him when his son, who had married
in Sydney, invited him to come and live
with them and had sent his passage-money.
There had seemed a small ray of hope in
this; his annuity of £5O would make him not
entirely dependent on Raoul, and Australia
was famously a wonderful place. But pre-
sently the ray had been extinguished; the
influenza epidemic had killed both Raoul and
Alary and had left him and young Guy. who
was a baby «then, to the shambles of this
house in I’almer-street. Mrs. Wales was
Alary’s aunt; and in return for his annuity
she gave him and his grandson a home.
AI. Meunier rose stiffly to his feet; he must
get a cup of tea. Without doubt it was a
home; there was food and shelter. But a
cloud of listless hopelessness was upon him;
he moved purposelessly about the small, dirty
room, without interest, almost without life.
Day followe.d bitter day in Mrs. Wales’s
house—nagging, strident, terrible days. But
what would you—he was dependent; Mrs.
Wales did not fail to remind him often that
he and Guy cost twice his pound a w T eek to
feed. He was worthless; an old encum-
brance. He could do a little, a very little.
to justify his existence by taking parcels 01
laundered clothes to customers; but other-
wise he w-as a nothing. There was the grave,
of course; but the grave came as it came
that could only be an accident of. God, beau-
tiful haven as it appeared.
He drank his cup of tea, half-fearing the
sudden return of Mrs. Wales and a loud out-
cry that lie should be drinking morning-tea
as if he were a lord. Young Guy was a
stranger; and that perhaps was well. He
had no softening atmosphere of the old staid
house in Rouen, where everything was done
for you, to defeat his young Australian liardi-
THE MODERN ULYSSES.
hood. He had been absorbed into the young
Waleses, went to school with them, was a
’i.oo boy with them. What had he to do
with an oid derelict from France? Yet
some little link with life, some tie with this
vanishing world
M. Meunier shut away his memories and
put his cup and saucer in the sink. To-day
was Sunday, the day of escape. In his tiny
room he took an old frock-coat, trousers,
waistcoat and a clean shirt from the ward-
robe and laid them carefully on the bed. He
went down the stairs again and had a very
thorough wash in the laundry, returning to
the serious business of dressing to go out.
Mrs. Wales and her admonitions did not
cross his mind. That air of listless resig-
nation, of defeat, gradually passed as he
dressed; by the time his collar was buttoned
to his satisfaction a debonair old French
gentleman smiled back at him from the fly-
blown mirror. Ultimately, a stately old man
with obviously a quite good idea of himself
opened Mrs. Wales's gate and walked with
just a faint suggestion of swagger down the
street and round the corner. The watchful
’Loo no doubt saw’ and admired him, though
the streets were still empty and dead in the
sunshine.
Half-way across the Domain he was met
by another old gentleman who saluted him
with every mark of respect.
“Bonjour, Monsieur Adolphe,’’ this old
man greeted him, bowing and raising liis hat.
“How do you find yourself to-day?”
“Well enough, Turpin, well enough. And
you?” M. Meunier received his companion’s
respectful greeting with dignity, but cordi-
ally. Old Turpin wms the son of Uncle
Jacques’s bailiff at Rouen ; it was from Tur-
pin’s son—who, alas, had fallen in the war—
that Raoul had got the idea of coming to
Australia. The old chap, who lived with his
daughter-in-law and was desperately poor,
had followed his son when the downfall of
the Rouen Meuniers was complete. Of
course, his connection with the Meuniers
was—well, what it was. But one observed
the conventions with cordiality. Old Turpin
spoke French; and for that, on this day of
escape, Monsieur Adolphe was eternally
grateful to him. Besides, he embodied the
old life —ah, bon Dial, the old life!
On every Sunday, the weekly day of
escape, this little promenade to some shadow
of the old life took place. Across the Domain
and a corner of Hyde Park, into a narrow
sunny arcade the old men went, arriving
finally at the Cafe Edouard. Here white
tablecloths and table-napkins, gleaming sil-
ver and vases of flowers greeted them; cour-
tesy and respect from Edouard, the vivid
chatter of madame, supreme cooking—a glow
descended upon the old men. This was their
sanctuary against life and the years,
their sanctuary from the laundry and a
rough, incomprehensible house. Here they
were themselves once more, in the old life
and the old land.
The escape was achieved not without diffi-
culty and self-denial. Monsieur Adolphe re-
ceived half a crown a week from Mrs. VV ales
for his tobacco and pocket-money; but if you
live from Sunday lunch to Sunday lunch at
the Edouard it is not hard to reduce your
pocket-money for the dead days between to
sixpence. A meal at the Edouard cost two
shillings; poultry 7, of course, was -s. fid., and
was naturally seldom achieved. But for two
shillings one remained there for an hour or
an hour and a half, safe in the old life. He
imagined that Turpin had to practise some
similar self-denial; but naturally Turpins
affairs were his own. At times M. Meunier
was not so desperately hard pressed for his
two shillings; sometimes a sympathetic cus-
tomor rewarded Ins delivery of a laundry
parcel with threepence or sixpence ; once ne
had received a shilling—a glorious day. ne
had managed poultry on that bunday wnen
it at last came round. And this weeK pio-
mised well. Mrs Lawlor, m the neyv Hats
in Brazier-street, had promised himr two'Shii-
lings on Friday. Of course, the wa S
a bad-tempered dog was perhaps—hut wnat
would you? It was life. And there was
Edouard. But what was it this old Turpin
was saying?
“I regret, Monsieur Adolphe." The old
fellow put down his coffee-cup with an air
of embarrassment. “But I cannot lunch
here next Sunday. I know that”....
“Do not distress yourself, my dear Turpin.
Why can you not lunch here on Sunday, if
I may ask?”
“But certainly, monsieur. I regret, but I
—I cannot afford it for next Sunday. After
that, of course, as usual. But not next Sun-
day.” . ,
M. Meunier waited. This certainly was
matter for regret. It was not for him to
inquire, but perhaps Turpin would inform
him; they were close friends, and a little
sympathy when help was impossible could
not be out of place.
“Noel approaches, monsieur; and I have
the habit every year of making two small
gifts, one to my daughter-in-law and one to
my grandson Henri. These I must buy this
week; and I fear that. I must add to their
cost the sum that I put aside weekly for my
lunch. You understand that I would not
forego the honor”
M. Meunier waved his hand in depreca-
tion and remained for a long moment deep
in thought. Mrs. Lawlor’s ill-tempered dog
crossed his mind, and the six days between
now and next Sunday. Each day was a day.
.... Presently he rose and took down his
hat.
“It grows late, my dear Turpin. Edouard
will perhaps need our table. Shall we take a
little promenade?”
liaising his hat under the rose-window of
St. Mary’s Cathedral, he turned to Turpin.
“I beg. iny dear Turpin,” he said, “that you
will give me the pleasure of your company at
lunch at. Edouard’s on Sunday next. We will
has poultry on this occasion, since I am to
have the honor of being host.”
* :!: *
The week started well. A parcel of col-
lars taken to Mr. Brady, the tobacconist, was
astonishingly productive. A waiting customer
glanced up at the diffident figure at the
counter.
“Mick’s shaving,” the man said. “What's
that —laundry?”
M. Meunier bowed. “One shilling and
tenpence to pay,” he said.
The waiting customer glanced at him
again, at his clothes and his boots. “I’ll
pay it and collect off Mick.” M. Meunier
smiled and bowed once more, handing the
customer twopence change. “Could yer keep
one down, Mr. Moonier?” the customer asked
suddenly.
This was incomprehensible ; but its corol-
lary was a shilling. “Go on, ’ave it on yer
own. I ’ad a good day Sat’day. 1 got to
wait ’ere for Mick to force me beauty, else
I’ll miss him.”
This was good. With Mrs. Lawlor’s dog
on Friday and the tobacco half-crown on
Saturday, the poultry at Edouard’s on Sun-
day was safe, and with sixpence for con-
tingencies. If the week went on like this
there might even, who knows, be a cigar for
Turpin and himself!
But the week didn’t. Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday were entirely unproductive.
No matter; there remained Friday and
Saturday; the poultry was safe, if the
cigars must go.
The jealous gods had not done. On Fri-
day the lady in the flat opposite Mrs. Law-
lor’s opened her door and took the laundry.
“Mrs. Lawlor’s away for the week-end. Mr.
Moonier,” she told him. “She left a message
that she’d be glad if you could come and

do that little job for ’er next Friday instead
of to-day.”
He reeled down Brazier-street. This was
a kick below the belt. He was contracted
to poor old Turpin for poultry; and he would
be sixpence short of the ordinary lunch....
And only Saturday to pass....
In the kitchen at home he found Clifford
Mimbles, a symphony in grey from his suede
slums to the black pearl in his tie-pin. An
intolerable young man, who seemed in some
mysterious way to be connected with Mrs.
Wales’s husband, so long and unaccountably
DTD HER BEST.

an absentee from his household. Indeed,
this evening he came with Christmas gifts—
a little early, as he explained, since he had
to go to Adelaide on business on Monday.
His gift for M. Meunier was a tin of
tobacco.
The significance of this was not apparent
at once. But Mrs. Wales’s husky voice cut
across tli e tide of French gratitude, and made
the situation abundantly clear.
“Goodo, Cliff,” she said. “Now, that’s
real thoughtful of yer, in more ways than you
think. You can do without yer ’alf-dollar
this week, Moonier. Yer boots are a dis-
grace ; I’ve got to get you a pair be Christ-
mas, an’ that ’alf-dollar ’ll just come in
’handy. Yer saved me life, Cliff.”
M. Meunier froze in his chair. “But,
madame,” lie protested, “I cannot do with-
out”—
Madame menaced him, her eyes narrow-
ing. “That’s right,” she said ominously.
“Grudge me tli’ bit o’ luck that’ll put some
boots on yer feet. I feed yer, bed yer and
clothe yer for next to nothin’, an’ Gawdblime,
yer stick me up for ’alf a dollar that yer
don’t want. Yer’ve got more tobacco in
that tin than yer smoke in a month.” She
came closer, peering down into his white
face. “Not a tray-bit do yer _ see till to-
morrow week. You got a hide,” she added
in husky murmuring scorn.
* * * *
In his room he looked at the tin of
tobacco. All was lost. The world could do
no more to him now. There was old Turpin
looking forward to his poultry the day after
to-morrow, to the honor of being the guest
of Monsieur Adolphe; and Monsieur Adolphe
had one shilling. Disgrace and ruin! A
French gentleman and his guest! Happily,
the day had been too much ; the deep sleep
of exhaustion and disappointment intervened.
Saturday dragged out its weary hours. M.
Meunier became, for the duration of the
dreadful day, a drunkard in imagination and
hope. Surely something, some wild chance,
would come to his aid ; he would rescue some
child of wealthy parents, find some money
in the street, receive a cable from Rouen. . . .
But the hours went leaden-footed by, and
none of these chances came to pass. Instead,
the dreadful night fell, full of ghosts and
silence. He took his pride down into the
pit, wrestled with it, and was victorious. On
the morrow, at 10 o’clock, when the house-
hold was safely en route for Newport, he
must walk up the hill to William-street and
confess to old Turpin that they could not
have poultry together at Edourd’s on that
Sunday.
But the gods were still at work. At
10 o’clock Mrs. Wales’s massive head came
round the kitchen.
“You’ll find yer broken meats in the
safe, Moonier,” she said. “Oh —and you’ll
’ave young Guy, yer precious grandson, fer
comp’ny to-day. ’E’s not too good, an’ I’ve
told ’im to stop in bed instead of cornin’ to
Newport to-day, where ’e’d only be a nuis-
ance. See that ’e gets ’is tucker, will yer?”
The bottom of the world fell out as the
roar of the departing household culminated
and gradually ceased. No lazy peace fol-
lowed it, but a blind horror. This last
was the foulest blow. Nothing could save
his honor now. Not only could he not take
old Turpin to lunch, but also he could not
’•ijform him. Guy, that bitter stranger of
nis blood, would tell Mrs. Wales of his
leaving the house, and all his Sundays of
escape would vanish. It was the end, the
end of all things !
The noise of a bump sounded from the
floor above. Heaven! Perhaps the boy
had fallen out of bed. Poor child!
Here was his grandfather lamenting a mere
question of honor. He hurried up the stairs.
The boy was washing. “Hullo,” he said.
M. Meunier came into the room. “You
are then not ill, Guy?”
“Not me. 'Arry Turpin, who’s the boss
of the Blue Feather Push, asked me round
to see his cinema to-day. I’d be likely to
go to Newport with the old girl instead,
wouldn’t I?"
M. Meunier said nothing.
"Yer see, 'Arry’s—well, 'e’s somebody up
at the school all right. An’ when hi' asks
a bloKe to see his cinema—well,
lie means it.”
A faint glow touched M. Meu-
nier’s cold heart. Never had
Guy addressed so many words
to him, and words of confidence.
The gate clanged below.
“Why, ’eye's ’Arry Turpin now
-—I wonder what he wants.”
Guy was across the room and
down the stairs. M. Meunier,
following more slowly, heard
him at the door.
“Who?”
“Monsieur Meunier your
grandfather, Guy.”
“Oh, Mr. Moonier. Righto. But what
for?”
“A message from my grandfather to
him” M. Meunier had reached the hall.
Turpin? Ah the English pronunciation —
this was the Henri that Turpin spoke of.
The boy at the door saw him and raised his
cap. “Bonjour, monsieur. Mon grand-
pere cst desole. II m’a dit ”....
The rippling French flowed on, balm to
M. Meunier's spirit in both its matter and
manner. Old Turpin had fallen 1 and
wrenched his ankle; he was heart-broken
and begged forgiveness; but was confined to
liis bed and therefore could not possibly
lunch with Monsieur Adolphe to-day.
Henri ceased, raised his cap. and bowed.
He turned to the open-mouthed Guy. “See
you this arvo, Guy,” he said, lapsing from
the rippling French as he clanged the gate
again.
“Gee,” whispered Guy, “I never knew
he c’d talk that lingo. My word!”
“Why not? He lias a French grand-
father.”
Guy grinned up at M. Meunier. “This is
where you miss yer swell Sunday feed.”
M. Meunier stared at him. “Oh I know—
I’m not such a fool as I look. I wouldn’t
let on to the old girl, o’ course; she’s too
much of a nark. But let you an’ me go
over an’ get a bite at your joint. I’ll shout
—Cliff slipped me a half-note for Christmas
Friday night. Are you game?”
Later, then, that stately old gentleman
crossed the Domain, not with Turpin, but
with his grandson. Passing the rosery the
boy turned to him.
“How about you teaching me this French,
Granno?” he asked.
FRANCIS BRIEN.
The Nigger.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“T T 7 7ELL, I dunno,” said Joe, “you may
yy be right. But the poor cows have
always given me a fair go.”
“I have read,” asserted the Englishman,
“that they are the lowest type of humanity.
Etlmologically they are thousands of years
behind the most depraved African niggers.”
“I dunno what that means,” mused Joe,
“but I do know that many’s the time I'd
’ve lost meself or the old mare and died of
thirst if it hadn’t been for Jacky there.”
“I have read,” the Englishman broke in
again in his most didactic manner, “that
they are absolutely not to bo trusted —that
it is suicidal to allow them to walk behind
one. They might tomahawk one at a mo-
ment’s notice.”
“Oh damn your reading,” Joe grunted.
“Nobody gives the poor sods a fair deal.
The only tomahawking I ever read of was
done by Red Indians; yet writers refer to
them as the ‘Noble red man.’ No black ever
yet did half the cruel things the Indians
did. Did Jacky or his cobbers ever put
a man on an ant-heap? Ood knows there’s
plenty about. Look here! For years we’ve
done ’em dirt, we’ve stolen theirland. we’ve
stolen their gins and worse. We’ve hunted
’em and herded ’em and put ’em to starve
on a few acres of land and tossed ’em a few
mangy blankets, and we expect ’em to say,
‘Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!”’
“But,” protested the surprised English-
man—for this was a surprising outburst
from Joe, who was usually a taciturn
monosyllabist—“look at their depravity.
Look at your Jacky now. Drunk! On
stolen rum 1”
“For God’s sake, man, stop your reading
and study ’em a bit,” snapped .Toe. “1
tell you they are not as black as they look,
and not half as black as they’re painted.
Jacky is drunk because he can't hold half
as much as some of the cows who slander
him and drink more in a week than he
does in a year. And he stole it because lie
couldn't get it any other way, which is a
damn sight better reason for stealing than
some of the city sharks who’ve robbed me
could give.”
Even I was astonished by Joe’s outburst,
and the Englishman froze to complete silence.
“Froze” is, of course, the wrong word;
nothing could have been less possible. We
were camped in from Darwin, and the heat
was almost unbearable, All the moisture
seemed to be oozing from one’s body in
order to leave skin, muscle and bone, which
seemed the only components of Joe and
Jacky.
Joe was the usual “Dinkum Aussie,” over
six feet tall, hard as nails, tanned like
leather, improvident to a degree and gener-
ous to a fault, loyal friend and tigerish
enemy. .Tacky was the other Aussie. Blacker
than your blackest hat, black
eyes shadowed by the tragedies
of centuries, a good-humored
grin that showed teeth the Win-
ter Garden might sigh for in
vain, and prehensile feet a
gorilla might have envied. The
Englishman was a plus-four
gentleman with more money
than sense, who could think of
nothing more worthy than pur-
suing weird sport in weirder
places —in this case shooting
buffalo because he hadn’t done
it before. Joe was there because
selling the hides was his pre-
sent means to some obscure end.
Jacky because Joe was his universe—followed
with the same unquestioning faith that a
starved and oft-beaten dog gives to some-
one that is unexpectedly kind to it. I be-
cause I was that übiquitous nonentity, a
telegraph clerk, tailing at the heels of any
adventure calculated to lessen the tedium
of foreign service. There we were, camped
beneath some mighty gums that raised
stark trunks from the anthills and looked
more like Dore’s transformations than real
trees.
Hot as it was it would be quite cold
before dawn, and this fact accounted for
the small bottles of rum which caused
Jacky’s delinquency. Tea may be the bush-
man’s drink, but when one must be on
the move for an hour before the first streak
of dawn tinges the sky, a stiff rum saves
a lot of trouble and an extra blanket.
A shooting expedition without dogs seems
a lopsided affair, but in the Territory many
things are different. When you find your
buffalo you do not stalk and shoot from a
safe ambush. You must ride out boldly,
gallop side by side and shoot him from
the saddle, if you fail to kill. .. .
Well, there we were in camp. No tents,
no elaborate paraphernalia. The pack-horses
were needed to carry the hides back to Dar-
win, and two good hides are about as much
as a pack-horse can manage. The scene
was eerie enough to provide the .thrills I
ached for. An ’ Englishman surfeited by-
culture ; an Australian virile with rude life;
SHE DIDN’T WANT THE NEIGHBORS TO TALK.
“I think I’d better mend the holes in that shirt, George, before
anyone sees us.”
an aboriginal survivor of a primitive people;
an onlooker at life’s game. Jacky sprawled
by the fire with a fatuous grin. The Eng-
lishman and Joe had their blankets well
pulled up and a sort of cheesecloth bag
over all as some protection against /the
vicious mosquitoesi and sandflies. I sat
with my back to a gum-tree and mooned at
the fire, dreaming what the morrow and
other morrows might bring ere the day 1
would drift back to that enchanted harbor
where the ferries make magic trips to Manly
—a dreamland of soft arms and softer
words. .
So the conscious slipped into the uncon-
scious with scarce a borderline; and it
seemed that almost before I was asleep
•Tacky was shaking me back to life and a
sense of aching limbs. Nothing fatuous
about Jacky this morning. He was vibrant
with a knowledge of the wild unsensed by
us.
“My word,” said Jacky, “plenty crocodile
been walk about. You smell um?
I could smell nothing, and said so,
although at times when the crocodiles have
been very close their musty, musky smell
was unmistakeable.
“Been walk alonga creek all night, ’ stated
Jacky. “Big pfellar empty belly. You
hear um bark?”
And now I remembered a sort of barking
noise, somewhere midway between a fox and
a kelpie, that had been woven into the woof
of my dreams.
“I don’t like the idea of crossing the
creek before daylight,” said .Toe. “Some of
these crocs, are big chaps, and several times
they have dragged horses into this stream.
“Surely not,” protested the Englishman.
“The thing’s bally well impossible, you
know.”
“My oath, it’s not,” spluttered .Toe, as a
stiff rum almost took his breath away. “I’ve
seen ’em do it. Nothing’s impossible to a
croc. The flaming swine’ll grab a horse by
the nose and pull like a bulldog on a bit of
rag.”
Still, we decided to chance it. Jacky led
the way—more because iie knew the crossing
than because of any braggadocio on his part
or lack of courage in the others. The water
at the fording-place was only a few feet deep,
but it was all in a muddy swirl, with deep
water on both sides of the crossing. .Tacky
was twenty yards out in the stream, with five
yards separating him from Joe and another
five yards between Joe and the Englishman.
The moon had just come from behind a big
cloud, and I was about to enter the river
with the pack-horses, when a fearful com-
motion in the water ahead made me pause.
A huge crocodile had seized Joe’s horse by
the nose and was standing half out of the
water in its endeavor to drag the horse
down. Joe must have dropped his rifle as the
horse reared, but he whipped out his revolver
and we could hear the bullets rattle on the
croc.’s armor-plated hide, without the
slightest apparent result. Then .Toe hurled
himself out of the saddle and kicked at the
crocodile in impotent fury. Ilad it not been
for the grim seriousness of the thing I could
have screamed with laughter at his ridicu-
lous efforts against the foul monster.
Suddenly the croc, released his hold on the
horse and with a swerve of the head fastened
on Joe’s gaitercd leg and, upsetting his bal-
ance, threw him face down in the water. The
Englishman shouted with horror, but his
courage was of the blind, bulldog variety,
and he fairly threw himself from his horse in
the path of the advancing crocodile. A cro-
codile may seem clumsy on land, but in the
water he moves with lightning rapidity, and
in a flash he turned aside and with a sweep
of the tail hurled the Englishman amongst
the horses.
I was almost paralysed by the rapid
sequence of events and could do nothing.
.Tacky was the only one who kept cool. He
had his rifle ready and wheeled his horse
to face the crocodile, but apparently he was
unable to use it. As the croc, dived into
deep water, with Joe making ineffectual
attempts to get upright, Jacky called out,
“All right, boss!” and, standing upright in
his saddle, dived headlong into the muddy
stream in the wake of the crocodile, and not
a second later.
The scene was
indescribable. I
don’t know exactly
w liat happened.
The horses were
rearing and plung-
ing ; the water
was being thrashed
in a dreadful
turmoil. Before
I reached the
Englishman he
had recovered his
footing and his
horse. The other
two horses splashed
past me to the
shore, and almost
at the same instant
the crocodile reap-
peared quite close
to us. It still had
Joe seized by the
leg; and sitting
across its neck was
Jacky, his prehen-
sile toes holding on
in some marvellous
fashion, and his
two thumbs stuck
deep in the brute’s
eyes. The English-
man and I simul-
taneously seized
Joe by an arm, and
.the brute either re-
leased him or we
dragged him from
those terrible jaws
as, trying to get
away from that
painful gouging
from Jacky, it dis-
appeared again in
the muddy swirl.
After an inter-
minable moment, as
we stared at the
spot, up popped
Jacky alone. Al-
most without paus-
ing for breath, “By
cripes, that water plurry cold! Any rum
left, boss?” he said.
“You shall have a bottle,” said the Eng-
lishman.
“Make it two,” said Joe.
We found that Joe wasn't much hurt, after
all. The croc.’s teeth had ripped and torn
the heavy leather leggings, but no bones were
broken.
A couple of hours later the Englishman
said, but with an awed respect in his tones,
“Look at that, nigger! He's drunk again.”
“Well, I dunno,” said Joe, “He may be a
nigger, and he may be drunk, but, ’struth.
he’ll do me!” . ' . .........

Maroochydore.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE is a way made wonderful with
beauty
Of flame-trees burning by the sheltered
streams;
But habit forges fast the chains of duty,
And now I find that way alone in dreams.
The shimmery haze beyond the drowsy
distance,
Wavering beyond the drifts of grey belars.
Comes back to me in sleepy, slow persistence
Beneath the misty chill of southern stars.
Often my heart turns back from tears and
treasons,
To one far home beyond the foothills
brown,
When Queensland suns wax fierce in sere,
dry seasons,
And friendly-eyed the Queensland stars
look down.
Often the voice of alien waters falling
On alien shores repeats the old-time lure,
Bidding me listen to the lone wind’s calling,
“Come back, come back to lost Maroochy-
dore!”
Maroochydore, heart of the North, my mother.
Fain would I go by windy bend and reach,
To where the north-coast combers break in
smother
Of sheeted foam along the yellow beach ;
To watch the blue Pacific flinging faster
Her mile-long legions thundering to the
shore,
The crested hosts that curve to white dis-
aster
In rainbow wreckage at Maroochydore.
he high winds on the headlands of the ocean
Across the dunes and thin sea-grasses dirge.
Mingling the music of the wild air’s motion
With ancient strife of shelving reef and
surge.
And low winds in the lazy camphor-laurels
un radiant dawns blow fragrant after rain,
When spring triumphant with old winter
quarrels
And flaunts her flags on quickening ridge
and plain.
Here in the endless strife of streets and
alleys,
Fret of the market-place and dusty din,
Is scanty thought of blossom-mantled valleys
In hills of home when August days begin.
Wind in the casuarinas, when star candles
Light the long corridors of night’s dusk
halls,
Where late the slim moon stepped with silver
sandals—
My heart is weary for your madrigals
The grey east lightens to the morning
weather,
Flinging her flames of rose o’er land and
sea.
Home of my love, my heart and I together
Have kept our wistful tryst with memory.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE was something mean, yet tenaci-
ous, about the very mud that clung
to his boots. He squelched steadily
along the road. It was raining—a rain
that suggested that it always had been
ALWAYS THE SAME, THESE MEN!
“Do you remember that time, dear, before we were married”
“Yes, of course I remember that time—it’s my happiest recollection.”
and always might be. A car honked down
the hill behind him and came to a stand-
still as it drew abreast.
“Have a lift, mate?”
* There was something of a snarl in the
swagman’s response. “Yes, Smith, it’s me.
I was coming out to see you.”
The swagman looked up sharply at sound
of the voice. He stared at the driver of
the battered car. It was the driver who
spoke first: “Why, it’s Dave Denham!”
“Why, that’s great! Glad I met you.
Jump in.”
Denham took his seat as though ponder-
ing, “Is he glad to see me? Why the Hell
should he be glad to see me?”
The rough track took all the driver’s
attention. Little was said till they stopped
at a sagging gate.
“This your place?”
“Yes; meet my country residence!”
Neglect and struggle were written all over
the farm; but Denham viewed it apprais-
ingly, with greedy eyes.
When they had garaged the car under
a tree Denham said: “Suppose you know
why I came?”
FINANCE.
“I don’t beliepe she’s nearly as well off as she pretends to be.”
“No, I fancy she’s overdrawn her account a bit.”
“No. Never mind details?. Glad you
came at all.” Smith was a debonair, care-
less cocky.
“Never mind details ! You like a bloom-
ing squatter—and me tramping the roads!
Me, your old mate! I’m going into details
—details of a little business about Armis-
tice time. I did two years’ quod for it—
what you ought to have shared.”
Smith countered: “Well, what does it
amount to? We both embezzled a little
Government property; which was sure to
get embezzled, anyhow, the muddle things
were in. You were found out. I wasn’t.”
“Yes, and why wasn't you found out?
Did it never strike you' I could have landed
you in the jug, too?”
“ VVouldn’t have done you any good,” Smith
said.
“An', mind you,
it ain’t too late
now,” Denham
went on, ignoring
the remark.
Smith looked
startled.. “Aw,
come now, that's
too strong. When
a man’s living de-
cent, to drag up
the only crook
thing in his life!”
“Only crook
thing? Yes, but it
was enough to
start y’ making yer
fortune.”
Blowed if I know. I didn’t get a hun-
dred out of it all told.”
Bali ! said Denham, in disbelief. “Here’s
you living- in luxury”—the sweep of his hand
took in the little weatherboard house with
the paint peeling olf, and the partly-cleared
hills behind. “I’d never of heard of you
# ,? r an acc ident wot has taken weeks
to foller. Here’s you rich and prosperous,
and me, your old mate, languishing in gaol
and tramping the roads. With me chilblains,
too.”
"I 1 ? I not put you in gaol.
And I did not give you chilblains.” The
farmer was speaking coldly now.
“An’ I didn’t put you in gaol—yet,” Den-
liam retorted. “I want a hundred pounds.”
A hundred!” echoed Smith. “I haven’t
got it.”
“You could easy raise it.”
“Man. I couldn’t. Everything’s mortgaged
tip as it is. I’m just living from hand to
mouth, not much better off than you.”
“You’d be worse off in gaol,” Denham per-
sisted.
“Aw, rot!”
“If you let me have that money, bygones is
bygones.”
“I toll you I can’t. What’s the use wast-
ing time arguing—-and the cows waiting and
all? Rut you’ll stop a few days?”
“I’ll stop till I get that hundred quid,”
Denham said sullenly.
Smith started the evening chores with Den-
ham at liis heels like some importunate small
boy -repeating liis claim over and over again
and pointing out to Smith sources of realis-
able wealth. By degrees Smith told him that
the land wouldn’t be paid off for another
o 5 years. The Repat, had a lien on
the potato crop, too. Also Repat. owned the
cows. And the separator wasn’t paid for.
It was dark at last when the round of
small jobs was done and they came in to
get tea. The missus, Smith explained, was
away in town. She had had a chance to get
back to the shop job she had had before she
was married, and with next to nothing com-
ing in she’d been glad of it. Smith lit the
nre and laid the table by spreading a news
paper at one end and setting cutlery and
plates, a loaf of bread, a tin of jam and
some butter in its shop wrapping. Then he
Put some meat to sizzle in a pan. And a?
the while the voice of Denham, like an m-
droned on in his blackmailing
effort.
“I’d be sorry as Hell to put the perlice on
to you after all these years,” Smith heard
him saying. “And there’s the missus. George.
I or her sake. I’m askin’ you for the last time
to fork out.”
Goaded to file end of endurance, George
flopped the steak on to the table and faced
his tormentor.
“And for the last time, Dave, I tell vou I
haven’t got it and can’t get it. But I’ll do
the next-best thing. I’ll make the farm over
to you, lock. stocK and barrel, just as it
stands, and walk out. You can carry on,
being raised on a farm like me. I’d just as
soon get a job in town.”
Denham gulped, a gleam of triumph in his
greedy eyes.
“You mean that?”
“Of course, I mean it. Here, wrap your-
self round some grub; then we’ll go over the
books and things, so you will know just where
you stand.”
Fortified by the meal, Smith dumped the
dirty dishes into a large tub where appar-
ently other dishes had been soaking for a
week. Then he got out the “books and
things.” They consisted mainly of scraps of
paper threaded on a foot or so of fencing-
wire.
He commenced to disentangle documents
from the file. “These,” indicating the first,
“are the butcher’s and storekeeper’s accounts.
That’s plain sailing.”
“Paid?” said Denham.
“No ; plain owing! Nothing off them for
six months I explained to you about the
land. You have only got to keep up the
payments and interest for thirty-two years
and it’s yours. One’s due now. by the way.
There’s this circular about it.”
“An’ what about meeting it?” asked Den-
ham.
“I’m transferring everything to you,”
Smith explained patiently. “You’ll write
down and pitch the best story you can
about that.
“This here’s a notice about poisoning rab-
bits. Everyone's got to do it on the same
day. That’s next Friday. I meant to get
the poison trail ready, but it’s been too wet.
You’ll get it done in time if it takes up.
There’s a stiff fine if you don’t.
“Then I told you the separator is a t.-p.
affair. She’s got less’n another year to go,
and then that’s over. Here’s a statement says
instalments overdue or something—you bet-
ter see about it; it’d be a pity to lose her
now.
“This notice is about shire rates. If they
aren’t paid by June 10 you won’t have
a vote; and if you don’t vote for West, your
neighbor, he won’t stand that fence any
longer.
“Ho, here’s a thing’s been coming regular
for a week or two now. It says ‘if pay-
ment is not forthcoming pigs will be seized.’
Don’t you let ’em worry you—them pigs
died of swine fever the week they was
bought. Still, you want to be careful. There’s
that sow and litter I got off West—-they
might make it a case of mistaken identity
or something and seize them.
“Then there’s these cows I got through
the Repat. Some of them have to be paid
for next month and some don’t fall due till
spring. The only cow that's freehold, so
to say, died in the gully last week.”
Denham had listened patiently. “Well,
it’s a fine little crop of debts you raised,”
he said. “Now what about the assets?”
“Well, there’s always the cows, of course,
for a steady income,” said Smith brightly.
“Since Christmas I must have cleared two
pound a week on cream. O’ course, it all
depends. Butter may go up or it may go
down. Feed’s pretty scarce.”
“Ain’t a drought on?” put in Denham.
“No, she’s raining all right. But if the
frosts set in too soon things won’t grow.
If you have to buy fodder you may make a
loss all winter. But if things go all right
you ought to get a pound or two steady.
Only, mind, you mustn’t neglect them cows
a day. Milk them regular five a.m. and five
p.m. And be clean about it or you’ll lose
your license.
“Oh, that reminds me. You’ll have to
take out a new one. But that won’t
run you into more’n about a quid.
“Here’s a shire notice about noxious weeds.
Blackberries and ragwort is terrible in the
top paddock. You’ll be summoned if you
don’t get them out this month.”
“Dot of time I’ll have,” grumbled Denham.
“You won’t have too much. You’ll have
to go like blazes to get some crop in now
the weather's turned. But those weeds' is
what you’d call imperative.”
“An’ you tell me things is like that an’ you

Denham.
“Well, it ain’t exactly me own, either,”
admitted Smith. “A bloke what had paid a
bit on it transferred it to me on account of
some money he owed me. That reminds me:
I promised the agents to pay a bit off the
time before last. You want to see to it, or
they’ll be taking her back. And there isn’t
a decent horse on the place.”
Denham received this in silence. He
reached out a resigned hand. “Bet's see that
bankbook.”
“It’s about euchred,” Smith apologised.
“But I’ll have to draw a cheque for a tenner
before I go. I must get my fare and some
clothes. I’ll ask the store to cash it and
you can fix it up with the bank after.
“I’ll get away in a day or two. Lucky I
had the papers and all here so it’ll be plain
sailing for you. We’d better see a lawyer
to-morrow about the transfer. I’ll set the
alarm so we can get finished up early and
go into town.

“Well, old girl, not exactly. But when I

prosperous, too.”
The alarm went off faithfully at 4.45 next
morning. But Dave was already half a mile
on the road to New South Wales. Speared
to the table with a fork was a brown-paper
bag bearing the message:
“You can pay your own blanky debts.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
W/HEN, in the blaze of morning, at the
portals of the day,
The bows go threshing outward, the
dull seas drum the beam,
Tis oh ! to hold a rover heart and take the
sailor-way
And watch the houses on the hill die
downward, gleam by gleam!
The hatch is snug, the log is out, the deep-
sea course is clear
For realms of topaz, myrrh and spice and
lazy, palmy lands;
And while the breath of fair Romance drifts
inward down the year,
The skipper rams a stubby pipe with
brown and knuckled hands.
For skippers feeling ruther peered;
The last trip hadn’t paid;
.The owners had keen “somewhat grieved'’
And spoke of “better trade,”
“Insurance, wages, famine freights” —
The skipper stamped below,
And wished them all where Davy waits
And icorn-out steamers go.
Calm eyes beside the throttle-valve stare
downward through the night
Amid the fume of hissing heat, the maze
of moving steel ;
They mark the lift and throw of rods and
keep them moving right
To fling the weight of spinning force
behind the lurching keel.
For Scotty knows the simple signs: the little
grunts and squeaks;
Th(> falter of the measured beat; the
wrenching as she swings :
The whinnying of spouting steam that hour
by hour speaks
Of twenty horses running wild between
the piston-rings.
And being quite a canny Scot,
Through level seas and warm
Tie lets her out another knot,
And eases down in storm ;
For through the patient nights and days
lie feels within his soul
The challenge of the ocean ways
Against the price of eoal.
So on the ledger of the sea the tousled
trampers toil;
From Sydney town to Zanzibar the page
is open w r ide;
They debit Smart Appearance with the price
of paint and oil
To coast the figured columns home adown
the credit side:
The hand that moulds the Empire wields
the tiller and the pen;
And east or west across the world,
wdiere’er the course is laid,
They bring the newer message to the hearts
of city men—
The mystic maiden named Romance goes
arm-in-arm with Trade.

BOYCE BOWDEN.
The Salesmanship of
Aaron Stubley.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AARON STUBLEY stopped his tractor
in the corner of the paddock nearest
the homestead, climbed off the driver's
seat, washed his hands in kerosene drained
from the carburetter, and, after a cautious
survey of the distant buildings for lurking
implement-salesmen, made his way home-
ward. It was little past four o’clock, but
Aaron was going out for the evening, and
the importance of the occasion called for
special preparation.
Aaron was a product of the bush, long,
lean and bearded. For twelve years he and
his brother had lived together and worked
together in a state of single blessedness. As
he was now middle-aged and seasoned to the
discomforts of bachelorhood, Cupid should
have left him in peace. But that unlicensed
game-law violator took aim at him and suc-
ceeded in inserting a dart beneath the
stringy-bark that was his exterior. At the
age of forty-three Aaron Stubley found him-
self in love for the first time in his life.
Reaching the homestead, Aaron looked
about him for signs of his brother. “Sam!”
he shouted, putting his hand to his mouth.
“Sam, here a minit. Want y’!”
A murmur came from the barn and pre-
sently Sam appeared. Save that he was
beardless, Sam was like his brother, tall,
thin, wiry and inclined to slouch with shoul-
ders bent.
“What’s th’ matter, Aa-ron?” he drawled.
“Tractor gorn bung again?”
Aaron shook his head and hesitated. “You
—you ain’t wantin’ th’ car to-night, are
y’. Sam?” lie asked. “I was tliinkin’ of
takin’ a run down to Sam Mudford’s place.”
There were no secrets between these two.
For over three months now Aaron had been
making weekly trips to the Mudford home.
Sam grinned at his brother.
“No,” he replied, “I ain’t wantin’ th’
car. Think you’ll ask her to-night, Aaron?"
“Oh, I dunno,” said Aaron, “mebbe. If
1 gets an openin’.” He paused at the door
of the homestead. “I’ll be makin’ a drop
of tea.” he called, “ ’bout ten minits.”
Having put a kettle on and washed himself
with a great deal of splashing and blowing,
Yaron slowly donned his courting regalia. As he
moved about the room he muttered to him-
self a little speech he had prepared. Satisfied
that he was at last word-perfect, he laced
up his boots and left for the living-room.
Over their tea, while Sam sat against
the open doorway on a kerosene box, his
elder brother spoke to him on the subject
of love.
“Th’ trouble with this courtin’, Sam,” he
said, “is that a feller may have all th’ gift
of th’ gab in th’ world, but as soon as he
gets soft on a tart an’ gets within ten
yards of her he finds he ain’t got no con-
versation left. Y’ never bin courtin’, so
y' don’t know. It’s a fair cow. I starts
off in th’ flivver wmek after week full of
things to say, an’ as soon as I get near
.Sousan Mudford all I can do is grin at her
an lie-haw ’bout th' rain or th’ flamin’
wheat! But lis’n, Sam.” he continued nerv-
ously. “I got to be able to talk, see? So
I bm practisin’ a speech. Er —what y’ think
of this, Sam?”
Aaron stood up and, heedless of the con-
densed-milk tin in liis hand, waved his long
arms at tli e meat safe.
“Mrs. Mudford, Sousan,” lie ejaculated.
Lis’n. I come here to-night to talk business
to y’. For some time I bin hesitatin’ to
tell y, but the time has come to be out-
spoken. I love y‘, Sousan Mudford, cripes
I do, an’ I’d like to marry y’. What say
we give it a go, eh?”
“Cripes, Aa-ron,” said Sam, “it sounds
good-o. She can't go crook on y’ if y’ ask
her like that. Only y’ wave your arms too
much —she’ll think you been spottin'. An',
Aa-ron”
Sam hesitated. Since the purchase of their
machine lie had taken up a sub-agency for
tractors, and made occasional sporadic
attempts to sell them to his neighbors. Mrs.
Mudford, he had heard, was in trouble with
the battered specimen left behind by her
deceased husband.
“Well ?”
“Mrs. Mudford could do with a new trac-
tor. If y’ get a chance, jes’ mention I got
th’ All Steel agency, will y’? An’ mebbe
y' could leave some of them lists on tli’
table. They got my name oil ’em.”
Aaron reached for his hat and snorted.
"Huh! Likely! Give us a go, Sam. Ain’t
1 got enough on my mind a'ready?”
“Oh, all right,” muttered Sam. “S’ long,
Aa-ron.”
Sam Mudford had converted liis wife into
a widow two years previously by a slight
error with a tin of arsenic. Sousan Mud-
ford, at tln> time of his death, had struck
Aaron as being just an ordinary, stoutish
little woman. But as time went by her
clothes became brighter, her figure and fea-
STAKES IN THE COUNTRY.

JACKY: “By cripes, yeh. Ehery stick of it.”
tures more youthful, her voice and eye
softer. Before he fully realised what such
phenomena meant Aaron’s subjugation was
complete.
Ten miles divided the two farms, and
though, as usual, Aaron had set out fairly
confident, before he had gone half-way he
began to have serious misgivings about his
ability to recall the words of his address.
These misgivings developed into certainties
as he neared his destination, and only the
fact that his approach could be seen from
the homestead kept him from turning and
bolting ingloriously homeward during the
last half-mile.
The evening started in much the usual
manner. After giving Aaron a friendly wel-
come, Mrs. Mudford brought her sewing out
on the verandah and listened patiently to
his nervous laughter and agricultural re-
marks, until the mosquitoes presently drove
them indoors. There Mrs. Mudford taught
him to play patience with an old pack of
cards until supper time, when an obscure
maid brought in cocoa and sandwiches. Sup-
per removed, Aaron found himself sitting
within a yard of his charmer on the horse-
hair sofa.
Desperately he tried to collect his wits,
to remember the words of his speech. He
was hot and nervous, and the fact that there
seemed to be helpful pauses and silences
between the widow’s remarks made him feel
worse. But at last he was aware of words
issuing from his mouth.
“Mrs. Mudford. Sam,” he croaked. “No,
not Sam. Mrs. Mudford—er, lis’n. I come
here to-night—-I bin hesitatin’—l bin” -
The widow sat very still. “Yes. Mr. Stub-
ley,” she cooed helpfully. “You came here
to-night”
“Yairs.” grinned Aaron, cracking his
knuckles convulsively. “I come here t'-
night to tell y’ somethin'. I—l come on
business. I —for months an’ months”
His courage and wits left him at the
same instant, leaving him utterly stalled.
“Meant to tell y’ before,” he gasped. “Y’
—y’ got a flamin’ lot er rabbits in th’ pad-
dicks, cripes y’ ’ave!”
Mrs. Sousan Mudford sighed and, after
murmuring something Aaron did not catch,
glanced at her wrist-watch. Aaron picked
up his hat and, with a curt farewell, made
for the door. He groped his way to the
auto., muttering and cursing. Viciously he.
stepped on the throttle and made for home.
"How y’ make out, Aa-ron?” his brother
asked when he entered the door. “Will she
have y’?”
Aaron shook liis head sadly. “I dunno,”
he replied, “I never asked her. I forgot
them words, Sam.”
Sam grinned unfeelingly. “Yous a fine
bloke with a tart!” he exclaimed. “Gripes,
I'd do better myself!” He paused as an idea
struck him. “Tell y’ what, Aa-ron. Why
don’t y’ write to her? She could read it if
y’ printed it. An’ y’ could enclose one of
them tractor lists as well. That's what I’d
do, Aa-ron.”
But already Aaron had decided on a course
of action. “Not me!” he cried. “I made
a bit of a fool of myself t’-night, Sam, an’
I either got to speak up now or give in.
Well, I’m goin’ down again t’-morrer, see?
An’ if I don't make Sousan Mudford sit up
an’ lis'n, my name ain’t Stubley!”
Next evening, determination gleaming in
his eyes, Aaron made for the Mudford home-
stead. He could now say his piece back-
wards if necessary. “Come here t’-night to
talk business. .. .bin hesitatin’ speak....l
love y’, Sousan Mudford, cripes I d 0”....
lie muttered. “-’Strath, I couldn’t forget
them words now if I was paid to!”
Boldly and noisily he approached the house
and ran his ancient auto, under the imple-
ment shed. With a shiver his engine pro-
tested and relapsed into silence. As he
stepped out Mrs. Mudford came to meet
him. a faint air of surprise in her smile.
“My!" she exclaimed, after shaking hands.
"I must be gettin’ popular, Mr. Stubley.”
She indicated another car with a wave of
her hand. “I got another gentleman inside
come to pay his compliments.”
Aaron stared, but the car-was unknown
to him.' Experience had taught him that
when strange gentlemen in strange cars call
on farmers to pay their compliments they
generally carry order-books with them. So
lie grinned knowingly.
“What’s this coot's line?” he queried.
“Drills or binder twine?”
Mrs. Mudford shook her head. By her
manner Aaron was aware he had made a
bad start. “Mr. Stubley,” she replied, “thank
you. this gentleman is not after orders. It
is Mr. Quirk.”
“Mr. Quirk, is it?” said Aaron. “Le’me
see, that’s th' cove bought old Pedlow’s place,
ain’t it? Used be in th’ machinery line, so
they tell me. Made money an’ retired —
yairs, I heard of him.”
Then a vague presentiment that all was
not well entered the wooer’s soul.
“Payin' a friendly call, is he?" he queried,
glancing keenly at the smiling disturber of
his peace.
Mrs. Mudford nodded. “Yes. He said he
felt it his duty, seein’ we were to be neigh-
bors. Such a nice man, Aaron ! But come
and meet him. Don’t forget the name—Mr.
Quirk. Mr. Sliedley Quirk.”
Aaron followed the widow meekly indoors,
and there the vague fears he had entertained
developed. Mr. Shedley Quirk was a dap-
per, well-dressed gentleman with a clean-
shaven face and assertive manners. There
was a city spruceness about him, from his
well-cut hair to his neat, shiny shoes. He
greeted Aaron with the easy assurance of a
host entertaining poor relations. Suspicious
and jealous, thwarted in the object of his
call, poor Aaron watched and listened, and
very soon his worst fears were realised.
There was no doubt about it, Mr. Shedley
Quirk was doing his accomplished utmost
to win favor in the eyes of Sousan Mudford.
A never-ending stream of words poured from
liis lips and arranged themselves into pho-
netic entertainment; the telling of one tale
seemed invariably to remind him of half a
dozen more, and the more this wizard of
monologue talked, the more Aaron’s hopes
fell and his anger rose. He was verbally
eclipsed. In vain with his own poor frag-
ments of rhetoric he attempted to stem the
tide of damage that was sweeping on. Mr.
Shedley Quirk’s voice rose and fell and went
on and on like the babbling brook. The
widow laughed and blushed and was charmed.
And Aaron sat almost unnoticed, a mere
shadow in the background.
In the vain hope that Mr. Quirk might
make an early departure Aaron lingered on
until after supper, but at last he could stand
it no longer. Smouldering internally, he
picked up his hat. But he was not defeated
—yet. After shaking hands he beckoned
from the doorway.
“Mrs. Mudford,” said he, “here, want y’
a minit.”
Mrs. Mudford went to the door, but ignored
Aaron’s attempts to coax her further. To
add to his discomfiture he was aware ME
Shedley Quirk was pricking up his ears.
Nevertheless, angry but determined, Aaron
made another attempt to say his piece.
“Mrs. Mudford, Sousan, lis’n. I come
here t’-night to talk business to y’. For
some time- —f’r months an' months—l bin
hesitatin’ to tell y’—l—y’ ”
Mrs. Mudford smiled kindly and com-
menced to close the door.
“Oh,” she said, “the rabbits? You told
me about them last night, don’t you remem-
ber? So kind of you to bother. Yes, I had
the poison-cart out to-day. Quite sure you
can see? Good-niglit.”
For over a week Aaron went about his
ploughing a disillusioned, disappointed man.
What was the use of hoping, of further faitli
in his ability to declare his passion? He had
failed to mention the subject nearest his
heart in a normal manner, and
he had failed utterly with his
carefully - prepared memorised
declaration. His courage, his
mem o r y and his powers of
speech had all let him down in
the hour of need. There was
nothing left but to erase the
image of Sousan Mudford, and
try to regain the old content-
ment of things as they were,
and live in peace. No further
effort would he make to voice
his love.
This resolve was strengthened
later by vague reports that
reached him of the widow hav-
ing been seen out in Mr. Quirk's
car; and so, for several weeks.
Aaron toiled on with tractor
and mallee roots and tried to
forget. But in vain! His love
was too strong, and curiosity to
learn more got the better of
him. He must find out for him-
self if the reports regarding his
rival had any foundation. He
must make one more call.
He spent much time in look-
ing for a good excuse, for he
did not mean to give Mr. Quirk,
should he be present, an oppor-
tunity to smile at his discom-
fiture. He hit at last upon what
appeared to be a sound idea.
Sam was still making occasional
abortive efforts to sell tractors
to his neighbors. Aaron would
make this an excuse for calling;
he would try to sell the widow
one of the All Steel machines —
she would have to purchase a
new one soon, so why not buy it
through him? He could offer
her sound advice in the matter;
she might even admire his
enterprise and business ability.
Becoming enthusiastic with
the idea, he spent much time in
perusing Sam’s leaflets, and ab-
sorbed all their contents. Feel-
ing at last his knowledge of
salesmanship would stand the
lest, he once more donned his
( ourting regalia, and drove down the old
familiar track.
Mrs. Mudford was surprised to see him.
But she welcomed him gladly. “My!” sin-
cried, “wherever have you been, Mr. Stub-
ley ? It seems ages and ages”
“I bin busy,” cut in Aaron. He was
charged with the sales-talk of the tractor
leaflets, and anxious to commence lest his
memory fail him again. lie cleared his
throat.
“Lis’n, Mrs. Mudford. I come to y’ to
make y’ an offer. Fixed as y’ are, tli’ farm
is too much for y’, an' th' time has come
to look about y' for ways an’ means of easin'
y' burdens. Sousan Mudford, in makin'
y' th’ greatest offer a man was ever priv'leged
to make, I come to y’ backed up with a
well-merited reputation for plain, honest
dealin’. If y’ accept my offer, I can guaran-
tee satisfaction, happiness, prosperity, an'
th’ end of drudgery. To run this farm
profitably and economically y’ need more
power and th’ aid of them that is willin'
to help y’; them that is willin’ to insure for
y’ your future welfare. Sousan Mudford, y’
will never regret acceptin' what I have to
offer, so what d'y’ say—will y' give it a
go ?”
For answer Mrs. Sousan Mudford crept
into Aaron’s long arms. “Darlin’,” she mur-
mured—“oh, whoever taught you to propose
so nicely! Of course I’ll marry you; but
oh I was so afraid you wouldn’t have the
nerve to ask!”
Ten minutes later Aaron Stubley regained
his voice. “But, Sousie dear,” he whis-
pered, still slightly curious as to the fate
of his rival, “what —what happened to tli'
Quirk bloke?”
The widow's voice was charged with scorn.
“Oh, him!” said she. “I don't never see him
now. D’y’ know what? You were right all
the time. After lie got himself on a friendly
footin’ he brought out an order-book an'
tried to sell me a tractor! Him and his
friendly calls!”
“Oripes!" said Aaron. “Ain't it a cow
where them fellers get their nerve!"

The Ballad of the Ship’s Bell.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BACK from the tidal river’s mouth
There hangs the old ship’s bell
And he who would be rowed across
To where the township’s grasses toss
Must ring, and ring it well.
“Ho, boatman, ferry me across!”
“Hi, boatman, row me soon!”
Yet it has pealed through stormy nights
And lived a hundred fierce sea fights,
Aboard The Silver Moon.
Out from the white-streaked sandy spit,
The Silver Moon went down.
And by the grace of the dear Lord
Were only five good souls on board,
And only four to drown!
Old Rill the bos’n, brown and dried;
The cook, who signed on late;
And able seaman .Tim Lemaire
(He left two bairns with yellow hair),
And Jan, the Swedish mate.
Old Captain Hans was saved alive —
Black sorrow score his name!
For he deserted all his crew,
Deserted ship and honor, too,
To barter death for shame.
And aftertimes he lived ashore,
A mollusc in his shell
And ran the ferryboat across,
To where the township grasses toss,
When people pulled the bell.
Within his lonely hut he sat,
And when the sea ran high
, He’d think of Bill the bos’n old.
And Jim Lemaire, strong-armed and bold —
The men he’d left to die!
i
For twice two years he live<J his life,
Until that wild, black night
When (fisher folk still tell the tale)
The sea was lifted like a veil
And spread in seams of white.
And loud above the towering wind,
Above the screaming shore,
He heard the ringing of the bell,
Like chimes rung jangling out of Hell,
Sounding on evermore.
“Who rings the bell?” He stumbled down,
The river-flood was wide,
And crowded on the moving beach
. Were fishers shouting each to each.
“Who rings the bell?” he cried.
“None rings!” a sea-drenclied fisher laughed
Above the ocean’s swell.
“There’s only wind and waves to hear!”
But still he looked and cried with fear:
“Who stands behind the bell?”
Old Bill the bos’n waited there
Against the sandy dune,
A spectre risen from the sea,
With slimy weeds about his knee,
All glistening in the moon!
With many a groan the captain pushed
His boat from off the sand,
And rowed the ghostly sea-tliing back,
Shrouded in spume and flying wrack,
And set him on the sand.
“Who rings the b.ell?” lie cried once more.
Against the splintered skies
Stood Jan the mate, with sea-kelp hung,
Pulling amain the brazen Tongue,
Watching with sea-picked eyes!
“God save my soul!” The captain blenched
And plied again his oar,
And rowed across his spectral freight, *
The dripping form of Jan the mate,
And set him on the shore.
FUR’S HE COULD SEE.
MAWTHER (immediately after mid-day gorge): “What do ’ee fale like ’avin’ for tay,
faather?”
FAATHER: “Well, mawther, ef me feelin’s doan’t change, I shan’t want nawthin’ more
’s long as I live.”
And still the bell rang harshly out,
And none could hear but he.
“He rows for naught,” the fishers cried,
Tossing their heads from side to side.
“His wits are in the sea!”
.
•Who rings again? His voice was hoarse,
For there stood seaman Jim
(Fle d left two bairns with yellow hair) ;
Beside him, ringing madly there,
The cook, dark-drowned and dim!
, .
Across the lapping flood lie pulled;
His frozen hands were sore,
His staring eyes were black with fear,
Gliost-voices gibbered in his ear.
“Ho, pull you, pull the oar!”
And breathing hard he struggled on,
As though he dared not stay,
Until the last of that dread crew,
Old Bill and Jan the other two,
Had gone their awful way.
Then casting down his oars he stood,
His shoulders to the tide,
And strangling something in his throat
Fell down across the flooded boat,
And said his prayers and died.
Still stands the bell in wind and rain,
And folks still love to tell
How Captain Hans one howling night
Rowed thrice across, no fare in sight,
And sped his soul to Hell!
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.
Gunner Gunn.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ r "T , HE living image of you—and you
I stand there looking as though you
would like to disclaim him! You
men ! But I know you—l’ll guarantee you’re
as pleased as Punch! Well, there he is!
You’re a proud father—and uoav your re-
sponsibilities have commenced!”
To the night-nurse, no
doubt, the situation was a
familiar one ; it was only to
be expected that she would
be conventional. But this
was my first experience—and
I remained standing awk-
wardly there, still peering at
my new possession.
Was it the sight of that
bald little head, that young
old face, this realisation of
fatherhood what Avas the
reason? For, as I stood,
there flashed to my mind the
long-forgotten figure of Gun-
ner Gunn.
“Gunner Gunn!”
Joe was his Christian
name, but few of us seemed
*,to know it. Doubtless a
familiar cry partly accounted for it; he
came to. be known as Gunner Gunn. Not
Joe Gunn; you understand.
It was at Tel-el-Ivebir that he joined the
battery. He created something of a stir
the afternoon he arrived, one of a small
party of reinforcements. That Avas after,
sweating conspicuously in the strong Egyp-
tian sun from the exertion !of carrying his
kit-bag, he had removed his Digger hat,
thereby disclosing a round little head, pump-
kin-like in its baldness. How had a stumpy
little old cove like this managed to enlist?
AVe began asking each other. At first, with
his Digger hat set at that jaunty angle,
his smooth face framed neatly by that
tiglitly-drawn cliin-strap, our new comrade
had deceived us.
As I see it now, we Avere mostly young-
sters in our sub-section then—more than a
fair sprinkling of ex-Citizen Force trainees
amongst us. It was, perhaps, unfortunate
for him that Gunner Gunn should find him-
self attached to our sub-section; for it soon
became patent that few, if any, of us had
anything in common with him. In fairness
to ourselves, though, I must say that most
of us made overtures of friendship to him.
But the new arrival did not respond; far
from being of a companionable nature, he
Avas pig-headedly reticent. Not a spark
humor in him; a somewhat morbid little
man; and on the rare occasions they turned
your way, his watery eyes would regard
you with almost complete disinterest. When
he spoke his abnormally-large Adam’s apple
would pop out and in in so ludicrous a
fashion that it became a positive strain to
regard him seriously.
A great deal of his life had been spent
on Kalgoorlie ; lie was a widower—cursed
with more than the average curiosity, my
perseverance rewarded me with these dis-
coveries only. By then we had long known
that Gunner Gunn had a son—a corporal
in the corresponding brigade of infantry,
all 0 f us knew. We knew, we knew!
Apparently Gunner Gunn’s one interest
i n life—his one topic of conversation, at all
events—was his son. “As game as Ned
Kelly. I tell you. my boy Bert!” We came
to regard it as inevitable; almost with the
regularity of reveille, it came. At first we
would humor him ; but how sick and' tired
we became of it—“my boy Bert!” We
could not help showing it. too—so many of
us were really only youngsters at the time.
Gunner Gunn. There was a name for
an artilleryman! No artilleryman needs
assurance on the point: we were genuine
enthusiasts then. And the tragedy of it
for Gunner Gunn was that he did not share
our pride in our cherished 18-pounder, that
perfect little masterpiece of a gun. It
seemed incredible, but it was true; and,
stung by our disinterest in “my boy Bert,”
he admitted it himself. “Gunner Gunn!
and he don't give a damn for the gun!”
someone on our detachment remarked.
It was scarcely flattering to us, Gunner
Gunn’s full admission. Not content to re-
main a looker-on while worrying over the
safety of his son, he had enlisted with the
sole object of being near him. His feet
“cracked up bad" ; “the infantry—they were
the boys”; but he would never have been
able to stand the life of an infantryman, so
lie had done what he considered the next-
best thing: he had joined the corresponding
artillery brigade. Since he had joined the
battery he had endeavored to “claim” his
son; but Bert “wasn’t too keen on horses,”
and had remained with his battalion. “The
infantry - the footsloggers they’re tin'
boys!” We did not disagree with Gunner
GIVING THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.
DAD: “Reckon most o’ them young girls’ legs must ha’ growed since that notice was

Gunn; but it was hardly flattering to us.
If lie went so far as to imagine that the
artillery was a “cushy” job, a few months’
experience of active service in France—we
were under orders for France then—would
disabuse him of that idea.
We had occupied quite a number of—and
been dislodged from a few—battery posi-
tions before Gunner Gunn obtained any ex-
perience of battery work in the field. Slow-
moving, disinterested, his mind for ever
wandering from liis job, he was held in
little account; and, had it not been for the
severity of our casualties, he would have
remained permanently in the waggon-line.
It was a considerably depleted gtm-dctaeh-
ment that he joined at that desolate position

and conditions there—although the shelling
was comparatively slight- were wow, than
any we had encountered up to that tune.
It cannot be said that we welcomed Gun-
nor Gunn; but, in recognition of his age,
we gunners did what we could to lighten
his load. We offered him the driest spot
in our humpy, but we did not press the
invitation. He preferred to occupy a vacated
one-man humpy, apart.
On our detachment we took turns about
at gun-laying—all except Gunner Gunn.
Sergeant Weston did not care to entrust
liim with that responsibility; fuse-setting,
yes; he was slow, but he was sure—let
him stick to that. He complained a little
of deafness, but he got on far better than
we had expected—all of us were agreed on
that.
“As game as Ned Kelly, I tell you—my
boy Bert!” There were so few of us there;
it was such a small circle; already we had
had more than a surfeit of it; and it got
on our nerves worse than ever before.
“Bert’s battalion’s moving up to-night
Bert’s battalion will be relieved to-morrow.”
Close by the batterv a duckboard-track led
up to the thinly-held line: Gunner Gunn
would spend a great deal of his time watch-
ing that track.
“The infantry—look at them—they’re the
boys * Hullo! No • thought that was Bert!”
When Bert’s battalion was occupying the
front line Gunner Gunn c rather touched our
hearts, his agitation was pitiable to watch.
More than once I had visualised the possi-
bilitv of it • had wondered how lie would
take it—and it came about. He learnt of
it himself—from a stretcher-bearer coming
r.nt from the line
“Tliev got Bert last night out on
natrol ‘ a whiz-bang all to himself!”
That was how, in dull tones, his watery
(wes upon us. Gunner Gunn told us the
news. “Bert! Bert! As game as Ned
Kellv mv boy Bert!” It did not grate on
our nerves then; we were genuinely sorry
for Gunner Gunn. I wonder what each of
ns thought’ It was Sergeant Weston who
hrnto the silence
“Bad luck. Joe! Bad luck!” He had
gripped Gunner Gunn’s hand : and we found
ourselves doing the same. Weston was act-
in” as batterv-sergeant-major at the time—
the B S.M. was on Bligiity-leave— and he
follow’ed' up his somewhat blunt expression
of sympathy by suggesting that our bereaved
comrade should return to the waggon-line
for a short spell. But Gunner Gunn would
have none of that.
“No; I’d rather be here, here with the
hoys,” he said. It was a graceful concession
to us.
A stunt was to take place at 2200 that
night; there were several hours to go; so
we whiled away the time playing poker in
the flickering candle-light. Sergeant Weston
had insisted that Gunner Gunn should stand
down on this occasion; he had given him
rather more than a double dose of rum; and
Gunner Gunn had retired to his humpy.
Although it was poker we were playing,
the hours seemed to drag by. At last Bombar-
dier Jones—he was acting as our No. 1 at
the time —gave me a nudge.
“Ten to ten. Better slip up to the gun-
pit, Frank, and see if everything’s jake.”
Pocketing my electric-torch, I crawled
out into the night, and floundered through
the mud towards the gun-pit. On reaching
the ammunition-stack I pulled up in mysti-
bed surprise: there—again—that movement
of a light! Someone was in the gun-pit.
Strange! I moved forward and entered the

it seemed,
it was high time I declared myself.
“Hullo, what’s the game?” I asked, switch-
ing on my torch.
Though somewhat hemmed in by that
cramped position, he spun round quickly
enough. Momentarily I recoiled, completely
startled by the unexpected fire in those
watery eyes, the grim line of that mouth.
It seemed an age before he spoke, still
fixing that hostile glare on me.
Get to Hell out of this, Barker!” His
tone, its thickness, was almost a
snarl. “You re not wanted here. I m at-

Here was a strange situation; and what
made it more difficult was the fact that,
although li e smelt strongly of rum, the un-

into the pit, against the gun-trail. The fall
must have bruised him ; he whined in pain,
It had been unavoidable, but I was sorry
that force had been necessary, as I con-
tempilited him lying there.
Battery! Action !”
Suddenly, bringing me sharply to realisa-
tion of my responsibility came Sergeant Wes-
Bin s megaphoned roar. Soon Bombardier
Jones, followed by the rest of the detach-
A BIT TOO QUICK.
“Why don’t you speak to her ?
“Oh, she’s over the odds—appearing in the Divorce Court with some of the confetti
still in her hat.”
ment, came scurrying into the gun-pit.
Quickly I explained the situation. In the
meantime, Gunner Gunn had picked himself
up on to his feet.
Bombardier Jones continued to regard
him blankly. “Better get out of this—your
orders were to stand down,” he at last said.
For a moment I thought that Gunner
Gunn was about to strike Jones; his arms
were still raised, but his lingers were twitch-
ing in defeat.
“Curse you! you’re a lot of narks, the
whole damned pack of you!” he cried shrilly
with eyes afire —for the moment only. For,
without further ado, he shuffled out of the
pit.
“Bert! Bert! They did me out of it!—
they did me out of it!” I caught that —and
it sounded like a sob.
“No. 4 gun, there? What the hell’s the
delay?” That stirred us to action; soon we
were warming up to our job.
It must have been an hour later when we
turned in for the night. A biting cold wind
was penetrating the humpy and 1 found
myself unable to sleep. Most of the time I
had been thinking of Gunner Gunn ; my nose
was still paining me, but I was feeling sorry
for him; he had just lost his son, and he
was out there alone in the cold. Out there,
in that miserable little humpy, he would be
awake—thinking of Bert. With a revenge-
ful spirit he had gone to the gun-pit; and
we had robbed him of his opportunity—in
the interests of those infantrymen ahead.
Was he still thinking harshly of me? I won-
dered. In my water-bottle there was still
more than a drop of rum; I would slip
across with it and give him some.
A minute or so later, torch in hand, I
bad reached his humpy. Poking my torch
forward I found —and the discovery struck
me with a strange chill —that the place was
empty! Further, his blankets had not been
disturbed. In the darkness I sang out his
name aloud. No answer came. A thought
then struck me: had he gone to the gun-
pit? Hurriedly I made there. The gun-pit
was empty. After wandering about, flashing
my torch fruitlessly here and thei*e, I made
back. No; he had not returned.
Alarmed now, I debated the matter. Natu-
rally enough he would curse at being awak-
ened at this hour; but Sergeant Weston
should be told. I decided. He was occupy-
ing the B.S.M.’s dug-out, and I made for
the spot.
Outside the entrance I psiused not a
little startled, for a queer, groaning sound
came from within. My nerves all taut, I
thrust my way into the dug-out. flashing
my torch before me. There came a rustling
of blankets; and in a flash I had centred
the light full on Sergeant Weston’s face.
Instantly I drew back, so distorted was that
face with fear! In one swift movement
Sergeant Weston had forced himself upright
in his bunk; now his right arm was reach-
ing out towards a ledge above him.
“It’s all right. Sarge!” hurriedly I said.
“It’s only me—Barker!”
“Christ! I must have been dreaming—
thought—thought—thought you were a
Hun!” Weston had forced a laugh. “Was
just reaching out for the ‘squirt’, too!
Now, that’s damned funny!—where’s that
revolver gone?”
“Ah!” Involuntarily the exclamation
escaped me.
At that Weston regarded me questioningly ;
he had now recovered from his fright.
“What’s the trouble? What do you want
to come and wake a man up at this time of
the night for?” he asked.
“It's Gunner Gunn,” I explained. “I’m
afraid he’s missing—can’t find the beggar
anywFere.”
Somehow I could not keep my eyes away
from that ledge on which Sergeant Weston
kept the B.S.M.’s revolver. He noticed this,
and turned to me sharply.
“What! You don’t think” he began.
“I don’t like to think it of any man ; but
you seem to be thinking so. too.” I answered
him. “The bom.’s told yon about that affair
in the gun-pit to-night, I suppose? Rather
a morbid cove, Gunn; and now that his
son’s gone. .. . Anyhow, what do yon think
about it?”
Weston pondered the matter. “Of course,
I could turn the whole battery out in half
a jiff; but, except that we would know
more definitely, there’s nothing much to be
gained from that. I’ll tell the C.C. first
thing in the morning. Poor old Joe —let's
hope it’s not that!”
Morning at last came. But it brought
with it no sign of Gunner Gunn or of that
missing revolver. All sorts of conjectures
were made; every likelihood exploited.
It came from an unexpected quarter—news
of Gunner Gunn. With breakfast long over,
and matters still at a standstill, we wel-
comed the appearance of Snowy Bates, one
of the “spooks” (signallers) from C.Pip.
Snowy was coming down for rations; and
his manner seemed agitated as he hurried
towards us along the frozen duckboards.
“Didn’t know whether t’ go back t' C.Pip
and tell ’em there first —the C.C.S.’s about
half-way, y’ know,” breathlessly he began
as he reached our little group. “ ’Struth,
y’ could uv knocked me eyes off with a
stick, I was that surprised!” We attempted
to console ourselves in patience; we all
knew Snowy.
“Th’ A.M.C. sergeant picked out me red-
and-blue color-patch as I passed by the
C.C.5.,” Snowy then went on. “‘Hi, Dig.!
One of your chaps here—mighty bad, too.’
he sings out t’ me, and calls me in. ‘Who
the devil could that be?’ I thinks t’ meself.
Anyhow, I goes in, and there on a stretcher,
with a blood-stained blanket over him, I
sees Gunner Gunn! I bends down over
him an’ he seems pretty near gone.”
Snowy drew a breath. “I knew yous was
all lookin’ for him down here—'Weston sent
us th’ news that he was missin’, over th’
line. ‘How did he get here?’ I asks the
A.M.C. bloke. ‘That’s th’ funny part of
it,’ he says t’ me. ‘What’s an artillery than
doin’ out at night on his pat maloiie in
No-Man’s land? For that’s where th’ patrol
picked him up—with a number of machine-
gun bullets through his guts and a revolver
in his hand!' There now, ,what d’yons
make of that?”
We said nothing; but all of us thought
that we knew.
“While I was talkin’ to the A.M.C. cove,”
after a pause Snowy went on, “I hears a
gaspin’ sound. There were several wounded
fellers there, but, lookin’ down, I sees ir
was Gunner Gunn. His bald little head
seemed funny-like; an’ his Adam’s apple
was thumpin’ up an’ down like a piston. ‘I
got one of tli’ swine—l got him !’ I hears
that. An’ then —you’ve heard it often
enough, but I tell yer it struck me differently
then —‘As game as Ned Kelly, I tell yer—
my boy Bert!’ With that, he gives a long
sigh an’ stiffens out. It kind o’ knocked
me t’ see him lyin’ there. ‘Poor old Joe!’
I thinks t’ meself. ‘A damned poor gunner,
maybe; but he’s managed to get nearer t’
th’ Huns than any of us !’ ”
Little was said in the battery during the
rest of that morning. Early in the after-
noon, seeking some distraction, I set out on
a search for firewood. It was while I was
fossicking about near the duckboard-track
that a couple of infantrymen, coming out
from the line, hailed me and asked me for
a match. They belonged to Bert’s battalion.
I saw. from their color-patches.
“That was stiff luck about Corporal
Gunn,” I remarked, by way of making con-
versation.
At that they looked at each other —rather
questioningly, I thought.
“Why, what about Corporal Gunn?” one
of them asked.
“Out on patrol—a whiz-bang all to him-
self.” a little puzzled, I answered.
“Oh, that!” They spoke almost in unison.
“That wasn’t Corporal Gunn; that was
Corporal Dunn. Dunn—not Gunn.”
“What!” I almost hissed the word. But
they seemed not to have noticed. Something
had tickled the fancy of one of them. He
laughed aloud as he turned to his mate.
“Corporal Guqn ! That cold-footed squib !
That dug-out king!” <
They returned me my box of matches.
Then they left me standing there—speech-
less, motionless, with my heart going out
to that father of fathers, Gunner Gunn.
HORTON BROOKS.
The Call of the Pack
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MAN and beast glared threateningly into
one another’s eyes. Yet hardly a man.
Midway between the two. For his tribe,
who carry on the inexorable riddle of exist-
ence in the Bad Lands which fringe the
west coast of Cape York Peninsula, are
hardly yet even in the Stone Age. Their
greatest contribution to science is the jagged
piece of quarto with which they operate on
the young buck when initiating him into war-
riorhood, and the sharp splinters of quartzite
which form the wicked barbs of their war
spears. Their simple cooking utensils are
of bark, their weapons of wood made hard by
slow roasting in the fire.
Now Murooroo, initiated warrior of his
tribe, with a broken leg and one arm crushed
beneath a boulder, lay pinned in the dry
gully-bod and glared back at cold, yellow eyes
which sneered into his own.
Three dainty birds with fan-shaped blue
tail-feathers twittered very busily in a honey-
suckle bush, a glistening black snake slith-
ered gracefully over a crinkly tuft of grass,
insects hummed in the bright early after-
noon air and all the warm life of the great,
hard-hearted bush went serenely on.
Murooroo did not waste time in reviling
his unskilfulness in stepping on the Pneiy-
poised boulder which had overbalanced be-
neath his weight and crashed with him to the
gully bottom. His brain was not by many
centuries developed for such detailed
thoughts. But it could reason the chances
between life and death.
Could the dingo kill him? Could he kill
the dingo? His hunting spears had fallen
beyond his reach. He could use one leg and
one arm. Was the dingo too cunning to
come within reach so that he could suddenly
sling leg or arm around it and sink his bone-
crushing teeth deep into its hairy throat?
For a long motionless hour the dingo glared
at the black man. Through its baleful yellow
eyes its brain, so very near akin to that of
the savage black animal pinned beneath the
stone, slowly calculated all his strength, all
his weakness. Then, lifting high its prick-
eared head, it sniffed the air’s message long
and carefully. Satisfied, it edged a little
closer to the black man, dropped on its belly,
laid sharp head upon outstretched forepaws,
snarled into the glaring black eyes with its
own unblinking yellow eyes of savagery and
t —waited.
The hours slipped by- Soon soft black
shadows enveloped the gully. A dull pain
hurt the black man’s head as he tried so hard,
and for the first time in his life, to think.
He had boastfully left the hunting-party to
kill much game by himself. They had

MISTRESS: “Sarah! I found my under-skirt in your trunk.”
SARAH : “Just fancy, and it was only the other day you thought you had lost it."
laughed derisively. They would miss him at
the camp-fires to-niglit. But fear of the
Spirits of the Dead would keep them from
looking for him. At the first flush of the
Sun-god they would be on his tracks. Quickly
they would find him—but only his tougher
bones would be left if the pack came.
Murooroo’s gleaming eyes suddenly stared
hard at the dingo’s gaunt flanks. The gully
became quite dark and very silent.
A light, a new light, shone suddenly from
the wild man’s eyes. A pleasant, unknown
thrill ran through his body. From the birth
of thought had come slow understanding.
From understanding, hope.
The dingo’s flanks were very hollow. The
ribs stood out hard and taut, almost like
those of a dead thing. It was famishing. But
it had made certain of its meal. Otherwise it
long since would have called the pack. It
had only to wait. It would not call the pack
now as the night wore on. That would mean
lighting for a small share of the meal.
The dingo, its eyes balls of living flame in
the darkness, dragged on its belly a little
closer. The. black man bared gleaming white
teeth, and a low, half-fearful, half-triumph-
ant rumble came from deep down in his
throat.
Back in the gloom of the stunted timber a
mongrel was loping over the dark earth. Its
nose was to the ground and it was following
tracks. Now and again it would stop short,
the bristles from its mangy scar-striped body
rising stiffly erect along its back, the fangs
gleaming in a noiseless snarl, the red-rimmed
burning eyes fearfully piercing the darkness
ahead, to right and left, to left and right, and
behind. Then on again on noiseless pads,
only to halt fearfully once more at the
scent of something crossing the tracks.
To the gully bank from where the rock
had fallen the mongrel crawled upon its
belly, head pressed to the ground, flaming
eyes searching the blackness below. It saw
the back of the crouching dingo first, and a
shiver of fear ran from the stiff bristles on
its neck along the knobby backbone.
The dingo had crawled in a semi-circle
around the black man. Its instinct told it the
savage was almost helpless but would live
long. But hunger gnawed fiercely at its
lean flanks. The provoking odor of the meal
so near filled its nostrils.
Murooroo, twisting his neck as the beast
crawled past him, knew it was getting on
the boulder side, behind his head, where he
could not use his good leg, where his good
arm would be of the least possible use and
where he could not keep his eyes fixed upon
its instant movement. One quick spring, one
clash of those sharp teeth across his throat
and he was done.
Throwing his hand behind his head the
black man clawed a hole in the earth and
lowered the back of his head into it. This
stretched back his neck. But he laid his
claw-like hand across his throat and snarled
in defiance as lie saw he could now watch
the dingo. Again he tingled with that
strange feeling, half-fearful, half-exultant.
Inch by inch the dingo crawled on its belly
nearer and nearer, but slowly, very slowly.
And down the bank fifty feet behind crawled
the mongrel, its belly quivering with the fear
it dared not whimper.
For two hours the blazing yellow eyes
shone into the twisted eyes of the black man,
his lips bared from the stretching back of
his neck. No movement from the dingo, no
movement at all. No quiver of eyelid, no
twitch of nostril. Just the burning eyes, the
gleam of half-hidden fangs.
But the mongrel, crouched close behind,
drew in noiseless breath for the spring. It
sensed the stiffening of the dingo’s tail, the
tautening of the tendons of the hind legs
drawn in well under the bunching body.
The mongrel sprang a quarter-breath
before the dingo. Its fangs snapped at the
dingo’s back as both animals crashed on
Murooroo’s head.
The surprised dingo leapt and was gone
as if on wings of lightning.
The black man threw his arm around his
hunting dog’s body, and mouthed it and
cried its name again and again.
From high on the bank the dingo looked
back over its shoulder, then stopped, sharp
nose in the air. To its twitching nostrils
came no other scent of man or beast; only
the crooning black man below with the mon-
grel stretched across his chest.
Long the dingo watched motionless. Then
it sat slowly on its haunches, lifted its head
to the starlit skies and howled. A long-
drawn, mournful howl that swept many
miles over the silent land to echo in distant
rock-walled gorges, a melancholy howl that
floated far over the low hills end down the
scrubby creeks out on to the great open
plains.
Murooroo, closing his eyes, lay back
against the cold earth and shuddered. It
was the call of the pack.

Captain of His Soul.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE silence broke.
Since the jury had filed in and the
foreman given its verdict of guilty,
silence had been unbroken in the court save
h.v the even voice of the Judge pronouncing
the formal sentence of death. The young
pale-faced prisoner at a touch on his arm
turned to leave the dock, and almost simul-
taneously his Honor’s wigged head disap-
peared as he went down the steps from the
bench. The departing crowd buzzed and
shuffled as it flowed into the' sunlight—the
drama was over.
John Linsay, seated at the Bar table, tied
Ins papers together, rose, hitched up one
side of a frayed and faded gown and made
Ins way out. He acknowledged a nod here
and there, as lie listened apathetically to the
solicitor walking at his side: "1 thought you
hail the jury with you till the summing-up.
You made a good fight, hut don’t you think it
was a mistake to put him in the box? It was
a weak story; didn’t sound even plausible.”
i “To me its weakness was its strength,
Chisholm”; and with this paradox they
parted.
Reaching chambers, Linsay tossed his
papers on the table and with a sigh of
relief, throwing aside wig and gown, seated
himself in a time-worn saddle-bag. He was
on tlie shady side of fifty, and twenty years
of criminal practice had told on sensitive
nerves. Why, he often asked himself, had
he not taken up the Equity side? After so
many years of crime and criminals one ought
to be hardened. He wasn’t—never would
be. He had his temperament from that mys-
tical old father of his who loved to probe
beneath the skin of things. “Remember,” he
had said, “that under the surface acts there
may lie urges and impulses begotten of the
blood of the past and but ill-controlled in the
present.” That poor young devil—of course,
he would not he hanged, hut it meant years
of imprisonment, brooding, thinking, brood-
ing. Now a Bill Sikes was a different pro-
position—just a dog in a kennel. He did
not think beyond the day. So young to go
in, so old to come out. Left two kiddies,
too. He rose and went to the cupboard
under an old-fashioned Victorian bookcase-
ugly and solid, like facts —and filled himself
a stiff peg from a bottle of whisky.
A rap sounded on the door and he tossed
off the liquor hastily. As he said “Come in”
the door half opened and a head was thrust
in.
“Not engaged?”
“No, just about to have a pipe.”
“Then I’ll join you, old man. Got a few
minutes to spare before lunch, and after it
I’m off to golf. Been in your court all the
morning. You gave your man a run ; did it
BANG WENT TWO SHULLIN’.
“I’ll bet that was an expensive coat, Mac.”
“Hoots, yes. I had to dine at a two shullin’
restaurant to get it!”
well, of course, but that sort of defence
doesn t . appeal to nie, Linsay. Gantree
skittled it when he summed up. It seemed to
catch some of the jury, though—there was
one chap especially. But the facts were too
much for you.”
“Do you know them, TregarthenV”
“Well, I heard the greater part of the
evidence yesterday and to-day; then there
was your own speech. Briefly they seemed
to me to be these.” He paused to waste
more matches on a sulky pipe.
Tregarthen, a much younger man than
Linsay, was possessed of ample means,
played in liis profession with the common
law and gave his serious attention to golf.
He prided himself on having a lucid and
logical mind; qualities, he said, the many
exigencies of golf had cultivated. Having
refilled his pipe and started it satisfactorily,
he seated himself in the chair at Linsay’s
littered and untidy table.
“Facts seemed to be these: The chap had
a wife not too easy to live with. Hanged if
I think any of ’em are easy to live with!
She was a good sort in the domestic way,
but with the deuce of a temper ; seemed to
have frayed-out nerves—overworked I sup-
pose—and at times got a bit over the odds
On the morning of the trouble they Quar-
relled about something.”
“A mere trifle,” interposed Linsay.
“Yes, a trifle. It was at the breakfast-
table. She rose abruptly and went to her
bedroom. He followed her. She became
violent, so your man said, and struck him
three times; then he seized her hands and
she shrieked. The little maid in the kitchen
heard the row and sneaked up the passage.
He opened the door and the inquisitive kid
heard him say "I could kill you, damn you ;
you make my life a hell!”
“The words of an overwrought man. Many
A DISGRACE TO THE PROFESSION.
“How long have you been married to Dad, Mummie?”
“Nearly fourteen years, darling.”
“Oh dear, you must have a dud lawyer!”
such words are uttered without any serious
intention at their back,” commented Linsay.
“Well, _to me, old man, they suggested
that getting rid of her had a place in his
mind —a sort of mental gestation. He did
not return till very late that night. I think
the girl said it was very unusual ?”
“Yes, he was a clerk in a warehouse on
a regular salary and handed over practically
the whole of it to his wife. She managed
all their household affairs and was rather
a dominant personality, I should think. If
he resented it he seems to have suppressed
the emotion —and that in itself was danger-
ous.”
“Shutting up the tiger, eh? Pity he hadn’t
some vice to let it loose on. Well, that
night when he did come home he used his
Yale key, but found the hall door bolted
inside, so he got in at the kitchen window
and went straight to the bedroom. The little
maid had heard him break in and lay scared
in her bed. Then she heard them quarrel and
an awful scream from her mistress and then
another; after that a sort of shaking noise,
so she said. Then, though she lay awake
till daybreak, she heard no more till her
master opened the hall door and went out.
After that the sergeant came back with
him, and a medical man was sent for and
certified death by strangulation. The man
made no statement.”
“Beyond,” so the sergeant said in evidence,
‘I never meant to kill her,’ and the sergeant
added, ‘He was very quiet and seemed
dazed.’ ”
“Well, Linsay, I think that’s about all
—and a very clear case to me. If a man
cages up a tiger, he’s got to keep him in.
His tiger, his peril.”
“You’ve said nothing about the man’s
statement on oath.”
“No, and personally I think it was a
mistake to put him in the box —and the
Judge didn’t give much weight to what he
said.”
“I believed it, Tregarthen. He went home
with the full intention of making up the
quarrel. After wandering about the streets
and through the park he saw the open door
of a church —a week-evening service—and
there in the half-lit building, acting under
an emotional impulse, he tried to straighten
things out.”
“Yes, I remember that; even if the evi-
dence hadn’t been so strong, that bit of cant
would have damned him in my eyes.”
“Human nature is a queer thing, Tregar-
then, with strange spiritual cravings in it.
Most of us live within ourselves, lonely souls,
and I have sometimes thought it so designed
that we may send out longing thoughts
to a God who knows and understands. Make
us feel we need Him.”
Tregarthen realised a sort of indecency
about this kind of stuff —like putting an
ecclesiastical window in a pub. Why didn’t
Linsay stick to the facts?
“He returned home eager, so he said, to
forgive and be forgiven.” Linsay continued.
“Scarcely had he entered the room when his
wife renewed the quarrel. Whether design-
edly or not, she distorted simple happenings
into acts of subtle cruelty and lashed him
with her tongue unmercifully. When he ap-
proached her she shrieked at the top of her
voice. He put his hand upon her mouth,
fearful lest she should rouse the neighbors;
she pulled it aside and shrieked again. Then
he caught her by the throat. He remembered
looking down on her face and his fingers
closing on her neck. The rest he said was
a blank till reason returned to him and he
knew that he had killed her. That’s his
story.”
“Yes, and it doesn’t cut much ice with
me. WhatV> a man for if not to control
himself? The facts all point to a deliberate
act.”
“But he took no steps to cover it up.”
v “The fools very rarely do —or if they do
they make a mess of it. This irresistible
impulse business, Linsay, is all tripe. If
men are going to let impulse master them
and sniffle that it’s irresistible, then the best
thing to do is to hang the lot of ’em for the
security of society. The backbone of all
ethics and all religion is self-control. That’s
the beginning and the end of the whole bally
gospel. Anyhow, I don’t see how you’re
going to know. I remember reading in some
text-book that it is not permissible to speak
of uncontrollable impulse. All we can know
about it is that the impulse was not con-
trolled ; we can’t know if it could have been.
That seems to me to hit the mark—a clean
bull’s-eye. Now, I must trot, as I’ve an
irresistible impulse for lunch. Join me?
No?”
As Tregarthen’s springy steps grew fainter
down the staircase, Linsay pulled out his
blackened old pipe and slowly refilled it.
“'Fine thing to be captain of your soul,
sonnie, fine thing,” he thought; “but what
about the poor, devils of mere privates?”
* * * *
Tregarthen sat alone at din-
ner. He had not yet seen
liis wife. Her maid said she
had been instructed to tell him
that she was very tired, having
been in the city shopping all
day and wished to be excused
from dinner and be left undis-
turbed to rest —an unusual mes-
sage that made him raise his
eyebrows. After
the meal the two
children came in to
kiss him good-
night. Then he
went to his snug
den, the home of
derelict furniture, a
few book - filled
shelves and odds
and ends. It had
a comf o r t able,
shabby homeliness.
Carrie had not in
her domain the art
of combining ele-
gance with ease,
and one cannot
sprawl in the pre-
sence of the im-
maculate.
He was ponder-
ing his wife’s mes-
sage as his eyes ran
idly over the even-
ing paper, when a
visitor whs an-
nounced. The maid
said the gentleman
had sent in no card
nor given any name,
but stated his busi-
ness was import-
ant. He was shown
in and Tregarthen
rose to meet a
middle - aged man
who stood in the
door in an attitude suggesting apology for
the intrusion. Having disposed of his hat by
hanging it on a broken-legged statuette of
Pandora, he seated himself opposite Tregar-
then.
“Have you seen Mrs. Tregarthen, sir, since
she came home?” he asked.
“No, I’m sorry to say she’s not quite well,
so I have not disturbed her.”
“Ah,” said the visitor, “I wish you had,
sir: it would have made things easier.”
“Indeed, in what respect?”
“I am here on a very delicate matter in-
deed, and —er- —naturally feel some hesitation
in approaching it.”
“Does it concern my wife —directly?”
“Yes. directly.”
“Is it any scandalous story you have to
tell, for if”
“Oh no, no; nothing of the kind you sug-
gest.”
“I don’t suggest anything.”
“Certainly not; this is-—er —purely a mat-
ter of business which concerns her and, of
course, you.”
“Well, what is it? Why be so mysterious
about it? Let me have it.”
“The fact is, sir, that one of the gentle-
men we employ for that purpose—by the
way, T represent Halifax and Sons; you have
had an account with us for many years.”
“Oh yes, the drapers.”
“Well, this gentleman had the unhappiness
to discover in Mrs. Tregartlien’s handbag
an article of no great value which he had
reason to believe she had not—er —received
in the usual course of business.”
Tregarthen rose and stood in front of the
diplomat.
“I’d be glad if you’d drop your confounded
tact —as I suppose you think it —and speak
out straight. Do you mean to say my wife
stole something from your dam’ shop?”
“I’d rather put it in the way I have. I
hope you appreciate my reason for coming to
you at once. The fact is, my firm is becom-
ing— er—a little impatient of the frequency
of these —er —irregularities—l speak gener-
ally—and even talks of putting all of them
in the hands of the authorities.”
“Are you after blackmail?”
The representative of Halifax and Sons
rose. “I regret that you have so grossly mis-
understood me. I; came to you remembering
that you are a customer of the firm —as your
father was before you—-and realising what
exposure would mean to your family.”
Tregarthen looked at the man. He seemed
sincere. Perhaps he had been hasty with
him.
"Sit down,” and he resumed his own chair.
S"I apologise, and accept your assurance.
Well?”
"The firm would like to know your view.”
“My view! There can be only one view.
Any article my wife took she intended to
purchase, and you will charge it to my ac-
count —whatever the article may be.”
“Is that a general instruction?”
“Absolutely; your firm wholly misunder-
stood my wife’s action.”
“I think Halifax and Sons will appreciate
that fact —and guard against it.”
Tregarthen bit his lip at the innuendo as
the diplomat retired.
“God!” and lie shrugged up in the big
leather chair, feeling limp and sick.
Half an hour later he rose and went to his
wife’s room. Crossing the floor he bent to
kiss her as she lay on a couch, her head on
a tiyisted cushion turned from him. lie sat
by her side and tried to make his voice as
easdal as he could.
“A man called from Halifax and Sons.
Know anything about it?”
He heard sob, her head pressed
into the cushion.
“Carrie, what induced you to do it?
Didn't you realise what you were doing—
tthieving?” The word hurt as it passed his
lips. “If—if you had been some poor wretch
tempted by what you could never buy, some
little flapper fascinated by a ribbon—well, I
could understand. But you—you who can buy
all you need, and far more—why—why?”
“I can’t tell you ; I don’t know. I can’t
understand it—now—the awful folly of it.
It was just lying there where I could touch
it. I seem to feel it on my fingers now and
—felt I must have it. No one was looking,
so I thought, and in a flash I had it in my
handbag. It was done in a second, and I
stood there half paralysed as it dawned on me
what I had done. It—it was—like drowning,
for I thought of father and mother and you
and the kiddies—and I was a thief! Then
I wanted —oh, so desperately!—to get it back,
but I couldn’t; everyoite then seemed looking.
THE THINGS A GIRL HAS TO DO!
“I had a dreadful experience yesterday. I had to rescue Jerry
when he was teaching me to swim!”
The girl at the counter had gone. I couldn't
move. I felt just rooted there. Then the
shop detective came up and asked m e to go
to the office. John, I can’t—l can’t go on.”
He knelt by the couch and smoothed her
tossed hair with a gentle hand, sympathetic,
understanding. So this was what Linsay had
been trying to get at—the breaking-point, a
mastery beyond our will!
* * * *
The Court had risen early, and Linsay and
Tregarthen, about to cross the crowded street,
met on the footway.
“By the way, Linsay, I’ve been thinking
over our discussion, and perhaps I was a bit
dogmatic. There may be something in your
‘irresistible impulse’ business—anyway, it’s
open to argument.”
As Linsay climbed the stairs to his cham-
bers he rubbed his chin and screwed up his
eyes as he reflected: “I wonder what’s hap-
pened to Tregarthen? Yesterday—to-day—
h’m! Doesn’t seem so damned cocksure of
his captaincy of souls.”

The Toymaker.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LITTLE son Robin comes running to play
With liis silvery swan that swims away,
A magical creature of joints and wheels,
With a crimson beak; and Robin peals
Wild delight as his swan sails by.
But I am a fool, for I listen, and sigh....
Oh, sigliing’s a f011y.... It swims so well,
That lovely, laughable, carven toy.
But the lad who fashioned it went through
Hell,
Through Hell and back when the world ran
red.
In his sombre eyes I tally the dead !
Little son David is calling to me:
“Come, look at my fish!” Oh, merrily
Waggles the tail of the gay red fish
With its gleaming fins And I wish, and
wish....
Oh, wishing’s a folly, and tears are vain;
Neither tears nor longing can call again
Hale old days for the lad who takes
Terrible courage, and fashions a bird
With a jaunty eye and a tail absurd
To pleasure a child! The laughter shakes
In the slim brown throat of a madpap boy.
For a shattered soldier has made him a toy.
There by the side of the wheel-chair lurks
A rapscallion Punch, and his little wife
smirks.
Hands that have sweated and striven in
France,
Pulling the strings for a puppet to dance!
(Daring his ’plane in the track of the sun,
Dicing with Death and a stuttering gun—
Oh, dreaming’s a folly and visioning’s vain !)
Soldier-man with the toys that jig,
Does memory turn when your eyes are big?
With your restless hands will you checkmate
pain,
Carving a toy, that a child may sing?
Shaping a bird with a frosted wing?

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CAROL, young Dave Camden and I lay
on deck and watched the rise of a late
moon in a perfect autumn night. A
good dinner, a satisfactory evening’s enter-
tainment and the faint lap of dark water
against the side of the yacht, all contributed
to a feeling of drowsiness.; yet none of us
made a move towards bed.
We were at anchor in Sydney’s exquisite
harbor, more exquisite by night than day,
for a myriad dancing lights make a carnival
of the darkness.
Carol, wealthy derelict, was making the
most of his last years of vagabondage. llis
yacht had seen almost the four corners of
the _ earth, and on the morrow we set sail
again, having added Dave Camden, Carol’s
ward, fresh from college, to our genial crew.
We had just celebrated Dave’s twenty-
first birthday with a dinner party, and the
last of our guests had departed shorewards.
Presently Carol broke the sileqce in that
quiet voice of his that had such power to
grip the most casual audience.
“Strange thing, but in the case of almost
every man, scoff as he may, it’s a woman
who shapes his destiny.”
“Hackneyed philosophy,” Dave commented
lazily.
“Maybe,” Carol agreed, “but none the less
a fact. There’s a strong element of truth
in all banality, you’ll find.”
“Oh, well, I’ve yet to meet tlie lady who's
going to interfere with mine.” Dave
stretched his long legs comfortably and lit
SAFETY FIRST.
“Wot makes yer think yer won’t ’ear from th’ bloke that promised to find yer a job,
dad?”
“I give ’im a crook address.”
a cigarette. The flare of the match showed
Carol the health in the dark young face.
“No?” he said, his tone gently satirical,
“Twenty-one to-night, aren’t you, lad?”
Dave laughed good-humoredly. “Oh. I
know there’s lots of time. Anyhow, when
it is a case of ‘thus are the mighty fallen’
I hope it’ll be for someone like Mrs. Gaynor.”
“You liked her?”
“Rather! Sweetest, happiest little woman
I’ve seen.” Dave’s verdict was fervent.
“Good thing she’s nearly old enough to be
your mother,” Carol laughed.
“And what about Gaynor?”
“Yes, lie seems an awfully good sort, too.
I liked him and he was jolly nice to me;
but there’s something queer about him.” He
hesitated. “‘Something repressed and un-get-
at-able. Seems funny for a chap of his age
to have retired —he can’t be more than forty-
live?”
“About that: and it’s a good many years
since lie left the military. Barry Gay nor-’s
father left him pretty well off, and I think
he dabbles in shares ; but his whole business-
in life has been to protect Pamela from any-
thing that was liable to interfere with her
happiness.”
“Well, he appears to have made a pretty
successful job of it. She’s as fresh and un-
spoiled as a girl. .It’s almost pathetic the
way he watches her.”
Carol nodded. “Such happiness is rare,
and it generally costs a good bit one way or
another.”
I knew what was coming, and felt dis-
tinctly uneasy. Carol was staring absently
at Dave and didn’t seem to hear some mean-
ingless remark I made.
“I don’t think you’ve ever heard me speak
of Ivan Gaynor,” he began slowly. lie
was Barry’s younger brother. We lived next
door to the Gaynors in Calcutta in the old
days, and I knew them all as children. Old
Gaynor was a wealthy shipowner and as
hard a customer as I’ve met. Even in the
days when he was caught red-handed in
the inevitable small-boy crime of rifling the
pantry, Ivan was a quibblex - . I can remember
one occasion in particular, and the youthful
scorn of Barry and myself, when, though
still with the incriminating crumbs round his
mouth, he stammered something about the
cat! Of coui’se lie was punished as usual,
partly for the actual theft, but more for seek-
ing to implicate the cat. And so, through all
the years I knew him, lie went on denying
figurative cake-crumbs.
“And yet lie was not a coward. It was
a lamentable streak in an otherwise line
nature, and arose largely from a shrinking
nervousness, probably inherited. He was
painfully sensitive, and if lie found himself
in an awkward position where an evasion
of the truth offered a way out, he always
took it. Anything to avoid an unpleasant
scene—lie simply couldn’t help himself!
The worst of it was he would do it over
the most trifling things that really didn’t
matter; so of course when he went to school
his weakness was soon discovered, and he
suffered mercilessly for it. I could tell
you of a hundred instances, and if I seem to
be making much of this it is because the
point of my story depends on your thorough
understanding of Ivan Gaynor’s nature.
“If there had been anyone with time and
patience to devote to his early training he
might have been a genius. But his father
was, first and last, an efficient business man.
There was no room in his world for the
artist, the dreamer or the philosopher, and
Ivan had a touch of all three. John Gaynor
only once departed from the rule of liis life
when, in a rare emotional lapse, he married
his beautiful wife. There was nothing effi-
cient about charming, irresponsible Pene-
lope Gaynor, and she gave final proof of
it by dying just after Ivan’s birth. Per-
haps if she had lived she might have under-
stood a nature that was so like her own ;
for, as Ivan grew older, his resemblance
to her became very noticeable. But to liis
father, qualities that had been irresistible in
the mother were merely contemptible in her
son, and he became wrapped up in his elder
boy. Barry was the most lovable lad I have
ever known, wonderfully good looking, bril-
liant at anything In? attempted, blessed with
the strength of his father, and with his
mother’s charm. Very early he discovered
his power to attract, and he made the most
of it.. At college and as a young man he
was idolised, with the result that Ivan grew
up in the background, sensitive, reserved
and full of a feeling of his own iniquity. His
own little world treated him with a slight!v
pitying contempt, the rest of the world passed
him over as negligible,
“Old John Gaynor sent them both to
Sandhurst as soon as they left school, ignor-
ing Ivan’s absolute unsuitability for* the
Army. ; His idea was that it would make
a man of him. Well, perhaps it did.”
For a moment Carol seemed lost in his
own thoughts. Then, abruptly, he took up
the tale again.
“It was while they were at the barracks
WELL MET.
“My doctor sent me; here to get thin.”
“Mine sent me here to pick up some jut!”
“Gracious, how fortunate !”
that they met, and both fell in love with, old
Colonel Grey's daughter—the inevitable
woman, you see! Pamela, as I remember her
then, was the sweetest, grey-eyed, auburn-
haired young thing that ever upset the
emotional balance of a whole regiment. Fresh
and simple, straight from school in England,
what more natural than her swift surrender
to Barry Gaynor with his irresistible charm
and a brilliant career before him? He liter-
ally swept her off her feet, monopolising her,
almost from the moment of her arrival, with
a laughing confidence that defied his rivals.
“Barry was as popular in the Army as he
had been at school, and everyone, from the
Colonel downwards, watched the affair
indulgently and. spoke of them and tlieir
youth and beauty as made for one another.
It Wasn’t till the engagement was actually
announced that I accidentally discovered
Ivan’s silent and hopeless love for her. I
don’t think Pamela knew anything about
it. > As- far as I could see she scarcely
noticed him, and if she knew of his failing
it did not' make her any the less kind to him ;
I think lie would have preferred her scorn
to her indifference.
“There was a big garden party at the
barracks to celebrate the engagement, and
after tea I went up to the mess for some-
thing. As I opened the door I saw Ivan
leaning against one of the windows at the
other end of the long room, evidently watch-
ing the: fun below. The younger set had
formed a ring on the lawn, dancing and
singing round the engaged couple. Barry
was holding Pam.’s two hands in his. and
the words of the childish song floated clearly
up to us in the gay young voice:
* ' “See this pretty little girl of mine’’....
It was all so youthful—the green lawns,
the girls in tlieir muslin frocks, the lads
in uniform.
“Ivan was too absorbed to notice me, and
there' was no mistaking the expression in
his eyes. I had always liked him, perhaps
understood him better than others, and sud-
denly I felt an immense pity for him.
Consequently I said in my gruffest voice,
‘Hullo, old son, why aren’t you down be-
low ?’
“He swung round, coloring painfully, and
muttered something about letters to write.
Not quibbling that time, mind you—only
the impulse of a sensitive nature to hide
its hurt from another.
“‘Seem happy, don’t they?’ I said pur-
nodding towards the pair in the
ring. ‘Well, it’s the best thing you could
wish them,’ I went on as he didn’t answer.
'She’s worth a lot of happiness; let’s hope
she’ll always get it. eh?’
“‘Yes, of course,’ he said stiffly.
“So having proffered my veiled comfort,
I departed and left him to make what he
could of it. Things went on thus for
about six months, then Pamela tripped off
to England to collect a trousseau for a
wedding in the near future.
“Nothing was further from our thoughts
than sordid tragedy; even Barry himself
does not seem to have had the slightest
fear of it.
“It was just at dusk, after a sweltering
summer day, that, passing Barry’s rooms, I
heard one sharp cry—a woman’s voice—and
then a sudden tense silence. I stopped
abruptly, and something in the hot, sinister
air made me aware of tragedy.
“Ivan and I reached his door simultane-
ously—and hesitated. Then I pushed it open
and we stood trying to take in the signifi-
cance of the scene. It. seemed quite unreal
to raft, like a stage tableau where everyone
is forbidden to so much as breathe.
_ “Barry stood against the mantelpiece,
absolutely motionless, staring down with
horror-tilled eyes, on u crumpled ligure at his
feet. He didn’t seem to notice us till I
spoke to him. Then, *0 God!’ he said dully
—-‘O t God!’ over and over again. The
woman lay face upwards, apparently quite
dead; and then I, saw a small boy of four
or five crouched behind an armchair, watch-
ing us with solemn brown eyes.
“Ivan sprang across and shook Barry
violently. ‘For God’s sake, Barry, what does
it all mean?’
“Barry seemed quite * dazed. ‘l’ve killed
her. of course, I’ve killed her,’ he kept mut-
tering.
“I pushed him into a chair, and mixed
him a stiff nip.
“‘Now, something’s got to be done, and
done quickly,’ I said. ‘Try to tell us clearly
what’s happened.’
“By degrees I dragged the story out of
him.”
Carol paused and knocked his pipe out,
with a slightly unsteady hand.
“The same old thing, of course, you think.
But it wasn’t.... quite.... and, anyhow, it’s
not the main theme of my story. It appeared
that when he was nineteen, still almost a
schoolboy, he had somehow met and fallen
wildly in love with this native girl. She
must have been pretty then, though she had
aged as quickly as women of her race always
do.”
Dave made a sudden gesture of disgust.
“Don’t look like that, boy. Remember they
were both just children. Barry, full of
spirits, and probably swayed by the romantic
glamor of the thing, in a country full of
life and color. And there’s this about it:
it Avasn’t just trifling. He really meant it
at the time, and married her secretly, afraid
of his father and the danger to his military
career. Then, after a year or two, disillu-
sion set in; and the girl, apparently tired
of the unsatisfactory secrecy, disappeax*ed
—went back to her people, I suppose. At
any rate, for six years Barry neither saw
nor heard of her. In that time he had almost
forgotten the affair. Then came Pamela —
and temptation! Oh, I know it’s inexcus-
able ; but I can’t help making excuses for
him. His love for Pam was the real thing,
and belonged to his manhood. No one knew
anything of the other. It seemed as though
it was done with, it was so easy to take
what the present offered: and Pam was
very sweet—enough to tempt any man. So,
after the first struggle and a few desultory
attempts to hear of his wife, he seems to
have put it right out of his mind, and left
the rest to luck. Luck had always been
with him, and, foolishly, he trusted her!
Then came the sudden reappearance of his
wife, and the small son he knew nothing
about. It was a clear case of blackmail,
urged to it by her menfolk. She’d had a
pretty rough time, from w'hat she told Barry,
despised by her own people for her alliance
with a white man, and her attempt to get
hush-money was to placate them.
“According to Barry’s somewhat incoherent
description, she finally became demonstrative,
and Barry, in his new-found love for Pam.
felt nothing but a sickening disgust and
shame. Unconsciously, he pushed her away
from him more violently than he realised,
and she fell, striking the back of her head
against the iron fender. I’ve heard, and so
have you, of more than one such simple
case.
“Barry finished his miserable story with
‘Of course, it’ll be a case of manslaughter?’
“ ‘l’m afraid so,’ I said, and we were all
silent, having nothing adequate to say. The
small boy began to cry, and I lifted him
on to my knee.

Bill’s Soliloquy
" Blast this Chris’mas business!
Why a bloke can't wear a bathin'
soot to play at Santy Claus, I dunno.
A coupla more miles in—a 'undrcd
in the shade—an' damn little shade.
If it weren't fer the Old Court I
promised the boys I'd chuck the job
—blime a bloke’s a mug, aint 'e?
Fancy runnin’ round the country in a
rabbit-trimmed flannel nightie an' a
blinkin' nightcap ter kid the mob it's
a 'oliday. 'Oliday—'ell!
Still I suppose Chris'mas is
Chris'mas and the Old Court sort of
evens things up —so 'ere goes.”


“Then, suddenly, Ivan sprang to his feet.
“ ‘Pamela !’ lie exclaimed. ‘What are you
going to tell her?’
“We had all of us forgotten what it would
mean to her. Barry lifted miserable eyes.
‘God knows,’ he said, and broke into deep
and horrible sobbing. His nerve was abso-
lutely gone.
“While I was wondering desperately what
to do next, Ivan took command. He, who
was usually so diffident completely domi-
nated us.
“He shook Barry’s shoulder sternly. ‘Stop
that!’ he commanded. ‘Pull yourself together
and listen to me. I did this.’ He waved his arm
comprehensively. 7 did it —do you hear?’
“It took us a moment or two to grasp
his amazing purpose.
“ ‘Don’t be a damn fool,’ I gasped. ‘You
can’t do a thing like that.’
“ ‘Yes, I can,’ he said. ‘lt’s quite simple.
THE BETTER HALF.
Boss: “Be careful Billy, that horse is only half
broken.”
BILLY: “Cripes, tinkit must be front half.”
You go straight and report to the senior
officer —it’s your duty as the discoverer of
this mess. When he comes, I confess. That’s all.
Everybody will be ready enough to believe me
—for once,’ he added, a little bitterly.
“ ‘But, good Lord, boy, you don’t know
what it means? Court-martial —disgrace—
probably worse, if they find you guilty.’
“I looked desperately at Barry; it was
up to him, and he showed his metal. He
had pulled himself together, and faced Ivan
with blazing eyes.
“ ‘Whatever else I may be I’m not a
coward,’ he said. ‘I got myself into this,
and I’ll suffer for it. When Carol reports,
I’ll do the confessing.’
“Ivan stood his ground. ‘lt’s not for
you,’ he said quietly. ‘lt’s for Pam. She’s
so young and innocent—so—so dear,’ he
stumbled over the words. ‘You love her,
and so do I; but it’s you that she loves.
Therefore it’s you who must be saved for
her. If you’re not a coward, do the harder
thing of the two and keep quiet.’
“ ‘But I can’t. You’re mad. I can’t take
her, and go on—see you probably shot, for
niy’ he broke off trembling violently.
“Ivan bent over him, gripping his shoul-
ders, his face indomitable in its grim pur-
pose.
“ ‘You’ve just got to do it, for my sake
as well as for hers. I don’t matter, and
I want her happy. Do you understand?
You’ve got to keep her happy all her life,
and God damn you if you ever tell her the
truth of this.’
. “Barry collapsed will liis face buried in
his arms, and for a moment you could almost
hear our heart-beats.
CANINE.
REG.: “ Don’t go yet—the evening's but a
pup!”
CLARICE: “May be —but I’m dog tired.”
“Then Ivan turned to me. He was quite
calm. The power of sacrifice possessed him,
as it can some emotional natures.
“ ‘Go and report to Major Hardy. We
can’t keep it quiet, and it's pretty rotten
arguing—in the presence of death. Better
take the kiddie into my rooms. We can
decide wliat’s to become of the poor little
beggar later.’
“It was the hardest thing I’ve ever had
to do. Yet what else could I do? It wasn’t
for me to destroy a sacrifice like that, on
my own responsibility.
“When I came back with Hardy, Ivan
was lying in the chair, and Barry was
standing at the window with his back to
us. 1 wondered how he would go through
with it. For me it was like discovering
the thing again—a recurring nightmare.
“Hardy stepped into the room.
“ ‘Good God, Gaynor! What’s the mean-
ing of this?’
“He addressed himself to Barry; but be-
fore he could turn Ivan lifted his flushed
face and began to stammer. ‘l—l—
didn’t’ he began. ‘Oh ! can’t you see —
I—l’ He buried his face in his arms
again.
"It was quite enough. The Major was a
stern and just man. I saw his face harden,
and a look of contempt grow in his eyes.
He knew Ivan’s
failing, and those
few halting words
established his guilt
as nothing else
c o u 1 and have done.
Trying to quibble
out of it! thought
the Major, and con-
demned him in-
stinctively. He bent over the dead woman,
then sent me for the doctor. I didn’t come
back. I couldn’t face any more of such a
tragic farce.
“Next day they court-martialled him.
Miraculously, it was saved from publicity.
Ivan made a confession, not detailed enough
to arouse suspicion—I told you, he was
something of an artist. Poor lad”
Carol’s voice broke slightly, even after
many years.
“They decided it was a case of man-
slaughter, and partly for Barry’s sake (the
irony of it!) and partly owing to the extra-
ordinary circumstances, he was allowed to
carry dispatches to an isolated post through
one of the northern passes. At that time
it amounted to certain death, and was pro-
bably an unprecedented thing in the Army.
“He rode away at daylight one morning,
and I went with him to the foothills. We
talked spasmodically of mundane matters
till we came to where the road twisted down
a steep ravine. We reined in. Ivan said :
“ ‘Well, we’d better part company here.
I’d like to ask you to do something for
me, Carol.’ He paused awkwardly.
“ ‘Anything you like, old man.’
“ ‘Well, you might take charge of the
kid, will you? It’s supposed to be mine,
you know.’ He laughed a little. ‘There’s
enough money of mine, and I’d like it to
have a chance in life.’
“ ‘All right, I’ll see to it,’ I said huskily.
“For a few moments we sat watching the
sun rise on a perfect morning. Then : ‘Oil,
well, I’d better be going,’ he said, and held
out his hand.
“ ‘Good-bye, old son,’ I answered, and
tried to tell him through the grip of my
fingers what I couldn’t say in words.
“I watched his lonely figure ride into the
sunrise, and that’s the last I ever saw of
him.
“All the way home I couldn’t help thinking
that, all through his life, people had doubted
his word, sometimes justly, sometimes un-
justly ; but when he told his biggest lie,, not
a soul doubted that he spoke the truth!
D’you get the irony of that?”
“But, good Lord!” Dave burst out, “it
was wrong altogether from start to finish.
What a hell Barry’s life must be —living
one long lie. It would have been better to
chance Pamela’s innocence and liappinessihan
to have robbed Barry of his manhood —which
is what it amounted to.”
Carol glanced at him quickly.
“I’m glad you think that. So do I—now.
But we were all young in those days; it
had to be decided on the moment, and Ivan’s
idealism dominated us, unnerved as we were.
That is why you noticed something repressed
and un-get-at-able in Gaynor. He left the
Army soon after his marriage—couldn't
stand the associations —and came to Aus-
tralia. He has kept his word —Pamela is
happy.” .
We were all silent, trying to sift it out
for ourselves.
“And the little boy?” I asked, because I
felt that I was expected to.
“The son,” Carol said simply, with his
eyes fixed on Dave, “I brought to Australia
when I, too, left the Army, and put to school
in Sydney. He is twenty-one to-night, and
I have told him of himself in such a way
that he may not judge too harshly. I gave
him Barry’s mother’s name of Camden,” he
finished quietly.
NIREE MOORE.
The New Rush.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was the morning after the Last Judg-
ment. St. Peter had had a heavy day.
and roused at last, in no good humor, to
an insistent knocking on the pearly gates.
A summons at this late day surprised the
good saint. All the sheep had been mus-
tered, according to the books. Surely the
goats hadn’t started playing up Elsewhere.
Probably the usual vacuous ass had missed
the ’bus. What a life!
St. Peter slammed back the gates on their
hinges and looked out angrily.
The long slope of the road below him
was thronged with men. Old mostly, and
silent and worn men, of all ages, with cloth-
ing of many climes and fashions. Most o£
them carried swags; all of them round tin
dishes and small pickaxes. For a moment
the saint and the assemblage gazed curiously
at each other.
The silence was broken by a large, fat
man who had been carefully “specking” the
golden threshold with his sheath-knife.
Wiping this on his moleskins, he returned
it to his belt and spoke up.
“We’re th’ ’weightchasers,” he said. “Dig-
gers an’ prospectors from any old where.
Where th’ likes of us hung out it waSjn’t
too easy t’ hear that trumpet of yours. Some
of us tumbled to it, though, an’ after we’d
had a miners’ meetin’, an’ th’ boys’d cleaned
up their boxes, we pulled out for here.”
The gatekeeper had begun a dazed refer-
ence to the congestion within, when another
of the crowd chipped in.
“We all got our miners’ rights,” said he,
waving his, “an’ pedigree an’ performances,
too. iCheclc ’em off with your card-system,
me lad. You’ll find nothin’ against us as
white men.” %
Hurriedly St. Peter ran through tlieir
papers. It was as
they said. Their
record of -.self-
denial, self sacri-
fice, matesliip and
heroic endurance
outweighed all else.
Yet it was with
misgiving that he
waved his hand to-
wards the open
portal. “Get into
it,” he said. “You’ll
find plenty of
‘dead-houses’ down
by th’ lake. But
be careful how you
chuck out th’ empty
bottles. Th’ angels
don’t wear bluchers,
y’ know.”
About noon
Peter’s earlier mis-
givings were con-
firmed. A seraph
messenger volplaned
on whistling wings
to the inside door
of the lodge with
a message requiring the saint’s immediate
attendance at the Lake-shore Boulevard.
Arriving in hot haste, the sight that met him
bore out his worst fears.
The golden pavement was studded
pegs and the golden shore of the lake was
similarly divided out, and here and there
some of Peter's acquaintances of the morn-
ing were taking levels along the streams of
milk and honey, evidently with the idea of
cutting races. Everywhere dour and confi-
dent members of the contingent were stand-
ing starkly by their pegs, while winged
cherubimic police with feathers obviously
ruffled regarded them with disfavor.
A splendid figure in shimmering mail
pushed his way through the throng. A little,
white-bearded man rushed up to him. “A-r-re
ye th’ YVar-r-den, thin?” he shrieked.
“You may call me that,” said St. Michael,*
calmly.
“Will, thin,” said the little man, dancing
as he spoke, “Oi’m Tommy th’ Jockey fr’m
th’ Ould Gira. Oi’m tellin’ ye, if one av
thjm turkey-polis comes meanderin’ round
me pegs, Oi’ll land ’im a ringabeller on th’
nose. This is new ground, wor-r-kable be
shovel an’ box. They’re tellin’ me ye give
a man a fair go here. So mind me, n&w.”
In spite of the turmoil and confusion, the
Warden could not but admit that; the in-
vaders were well within their rights. But
he had a few words aside with St. Peter,
which sent the worthy gatekeeper back to
his post bristling with indignation. This
was not lessened by an unceasing sound of
knocking as he neared home. With a smoth-
ered benediction he swung the gates open
and looked out to see what Fate had this
time assigned him.
Outside stbod a lean and solitary indi-
vidual. In spite of an air of neatness and
good grooming, he was unmistakably of the
same clan as the morning’s invaders. Tired
of waiting for the saint’s return he had
established a little camp by the gates. A
black billy was bubbling over a small fire.
Close to it lay a swag with the inevitable
dish, shovel and pick in close proximity.
The newcomer smiled disarmingly and
opened the conversation. “Good-day, mate,”
he said. “Just heard of th’ rush. Any
chance of getting in?”
“Not on y’r life !” growled the exasperated
Peter; “I’ve had enough roarin’-up f’r one
day over your sort; you can go t’ —the
Other Place.”
“Steady th’ Buffs,” broke in the urbane
stranger. “Have a heart. What’s biting
you, anyway?”
“Biting!” roared the now apoplectic
Keeper of the Keys. “B-biting! Why, a
whole mob like you. I put ’em through on
th’ nod this morning, and now they’re tear-
iffg,,th’ place to pieces.”
" The new v arrival seated himself on the
threshold, and considered, while he rolled and
lit a cigarette. “I’ve an idea what’s up,”
he said at last. “What is there in it for
me if I get rid of ’em for you?”
“You'll have a tough job,” said the molli-
fied saint. “But do it, and y’ can write
your own ticket inside.”
When the urbane one strolled down a little
later, lie found the invasion preparing to
settle down into camp for the night. He
was at once hailed as an old acquaintance
by many of those standing about.
“You’re late, Les,” said one. “But anyone
’d trust you to yap yer way in any time.”
“Too right,” said another, coming up.
“Where from this time, me lad? We’d all
tipped you’d landed in the Other Place.”
"Not exactly,” said the smiling new-
comer. “It was Edie Creek, though.”
“Any ‘boys’?” asked the first speaker anxi-
ously. ;■
“Not a one. They all downed loads at th’
fork where the roads separate for Up Here
and Down There. Then they bunked off, and
took their loads with ’em.”
“Stiff,” said a short, red-haired man stand-
ing by.
“Not so you’d notice it,” said the other.
“The fact is” —he lowered his voice—“that’s
what I’ve come up to see you about. Here,
Mat, Klondyke, come over here. Don’t let
the others know it. I got the office coming
up. They’ve struck it so rich Down Below
that this place is just a tucker-sliow besids
it. All you have to do is to get th’ ground
out of th’ gold ; not the other way about,
as we’ve always had to do.”
By this, time there was a crowd ten-deep
about the, speaker, and it was increasing
every second.
“W’at’s th’ water like there, mate?” cried
a dubious voice from the back of the ring.
“A bit short, so they tell me,” said the
newcomer, rolling another cigarette. “But
tli’ soil’s loose and fine, and it’s all dry-
blowing work. There’s always plenty of wind,
and some of you W.A. coves ought to score.
Climate’s a bit hot, but there’s plenty of fire-
yiood.”
“An’ what erbout th’ Guv’ment?” asked
someone, else. “This lot’s a bit ’igh and
might#”’!;
“Gddd-o, I hear,” was the reply. “Not too
particular about small matters; mostly old
B.N.G. hands.”
The man who had asked the last question
turned away and began to collect his camp
gear and roll his swag. Others followed his
example in increasing numbers. With a
THE SUPER-OPTIMIST.
glance at the little groups eagerly consulting
together, the informative newpomer threw his
cigarette-butt to a cherub who was fluttering
about on the look-out for it, and returned to
St. Peter’s lodge.
“All serene,” he replied to the saint’s
eager inquiry. “Leave the gates on the latch.
Tli’ whole boiling’ll be gone by morning.”
“What about cornin’ inside, yourself?” said
St. Peter. “Have a feed with me, an’ a yarn
an’ smoke after.”
“Thanks,” said the stranger, “but my
camp’s all fixed outside. In the morning, per-
haps. ‘Nighty-night,’ as tli’ Bedroom Story
cove says—so-long.”
Tired as he was, St.iPeter’s slumbers were
fitful. All night long the tramp of march-
ing feet went past the lodge, and the gates
swung incessantly on their creaking hinges.
It was late in the morning when he awoke
with a start. Shamefacedly he scrambled
out of bed, remembering his guest. On his
way to the half-open gate lie glanced over
his shoulder. The invasion of the day before
had vanished utterly from the golden streets
and shores. Municipal employees were pull-
ing up the pegs and relaying the gold-block
pavement. Block-cherubs were busy with the
rubbish. Full of gratitude, the kindly saint
threw open the gates.
“Comp on,” he cried —“what about a bit of
scran?”
There was no answer. Wonderingly St.
Peter’ gazed out on the evidences of a hastily
abandoned camp, in which a little heap of
grey ashes still smouldered.
Ilis deliverer had himself joined the New
Rush.

Grafton.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN Grafton the lovely,
In my own countree,
They caught old Time a-speeding
And hung him on a tree—
A very bad example
For everyone to see.
And I am going there now,
To the old, old town,
Where the purple-crested islands
Of hyacinth come down;
Where the river’s running blue now
And the reeds are growing brown;
Where jacaranda’s purple
At dawn and blue at dusk,
And the corn has caught the yellow
Of the sun upon its husk;
Where every yard’s a garden
Of color-song and musk.
Aye, I am going there now
To look upon the street
That’s carpeted with flowers
To dull the noise of feet,
And overhung with branches
To cheat the dust and heat.
It’s north and north I’m going
To my own countree.
To the sweet town of Grafton
To lie beneath a tree,
To lie there a-dreaming
With my heart hack in me.
And maybe there beside me
Will lie the lad who died,
The golden-hearted fellow
Of the fine eyes and wide —-
The lad I lost in crossing
To this far south side.
Yes, I will go to Grafton,
In mv own fair land,
From the blare of the city
To the still, soft strand—
Aye, I will go to Grafton,
And she will understand :
And she will wake her quiet
To walk her ways with me.
And morning and evening
Will give me melody
Of blossom-bells swaying
Through the whole countree.

CECIL MANN.
Scented Soap.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WILLIAM DURANT, corpulent and
opulent, mining magnate, pastoralist
and owner of the strong Melbourne
Cup fancy Brown Windsor, stepped from his
car and with a companion entered the
Middleton pub, midway, more or less, between
Win ton and Boulia, on the outside edge of
Queensland.
“We’ll have a wash, a drink and lunch,”
said he. “In fact, we’ll have two drinks:
one before the wash and one before the
lunch.”
After the first visit to the bar Mrs. Public-
house showed them to a room, -peered in the
washjug to note the amount of water it
held, shook the dust out of the towels, ran
her apron round the rim of the wash-basin
and left the room.
Durant poured the water from the jug,
sluiced his hands and reached for the lump
of soap lying in a broken saucer on the
side of the table. Absently he lathered his
hands and suddenly stiffened, sniffed and
smiled.
“Kerosene soap,” he said. “It’s years
since I smelt it.”
“W T liy the smile?” his companion asked.
“You’ve a keen sense of humor if a lump
of kerosene soap can tickle it.”
“It wakens memories,” Durant explained.
“It’s strange, y’know, how a sound or scent
brings back things which happened, say,
twenty years ago. I’ll tell you about it
while we’re waiting lunch.
“I was broke at the time. I’d done a turn
of droving and a bit of fencing. I’d run a
sweat wheel, hawked patent medicines,
opened a gambling school down on the
creek, and rouseabouted in a shed. My
last bit I’d done in backing tails against a
fellow who was spinning two heads. Long
Joe, the carrier, picked me up about fifteen
miles down the river from Longreach and
gave me a lift to town.
“Wealth is a matter of comparison. Long
.Toe gave me a quid when we got to the
’Reach, and with that .solitary note I felt
I owned the town.
“The races were on, the annual Show
Meeting, when all the wealth and beauty of
the district met, when those who had pro-
tended they had more, and those who hadn’t,
like myself, were out on the have.
“Long Joe left his waggon and team
down on the river. That was most incon-
venient for me—l had only a quid, not.
enough to pay board, and the river was four
miles from town. I made my camp at the
waggon, keeping anyone from running away
with it and, while there, seeing that the
ants didn’t eat all the food in the tucker-
box. But it was a long way to town, and
the racecourse was another mile .or more
further on. To reach the course in time to
have a look at the morning gallops I had
to get up about three, have my breakfast
and walk five miles.
“After the second day T found I could
lie in till four, attach myself to some team
of horses coming back from the track, make
myself important, talk big and chance getting
breakfast at a pub. Sometimes it worked.
Other times Joe’s tucker-box stood an
assault when I got back to the waggon.
I didn’t worry about the afternoon exercise,
and I didn’t turn up at the Show.
“There was a bit of a school of hazards
after the first day’s races and I went back to
the waggon that night with no more than I
had when Long .Toe picked me up. I’d*
chanced a dollar on the tote that day on a
horse called Rippling Rufus, lost it, got
half a crown for helping harness a four-in-
hand —this was before the days of motors in
the West —and I’d been passed another half-
dollar by Tom Shultz, a fellow I’d helped
some time back. I did a whole pound in ai
the hazard school.
“But, in spite of doing five bob on him. I
couldn’t help fancying Rippling Rufus for
the big race the next day. I’d been round the
stables, picking up what I could, but a hen
couldn’t have scratched enough from the
Rippling Rufus mob to fill her gizzard. I
liked him. But what was the good of liking
on nothing?
“After a hearty dinner of wind pudding I
followed the' mob out to the course on the
second day. Just as I was starting, looking-
for a chance to get a lift instead of tramping
in the dust, a John chatted me. He tapped
me on the shoulder and asked to see my
visible means of support.
“ ‘l’ve left me bank-book down in me swag,’
I said : ‘but I’m fair rolling in wealth.’
“ ‘lf y’are not out of town by this time
to-morrer, me man,’ says he, ‘it’s up under
the Dog Act y’U be. Now don’t give me
any of yer slack or y’ll come now. Get on
wid you.'
“I had twenty-four hours to show visible
means of support, and there was a goods-
train leaving in the morning at six-thirty.
Eleven o’clock was the passenger-train; but
that was too risky. The goods-train always
had a string of waggons; it pulled up for a
few minutes opposite the goods-slied, and it
wouldn’t be searched till Barcaldine. At
Westbourne, about five miles this , side of
Barcaldine, it slowed down when passing the
scour, giving a man a chance to hop. There’d
be a feed there even if there wasn’t any
work. I had to make good that day at the
races, starting from nothing, or it was me
for the rattler in the morning. I went out
to the course. The Lord only knows what I
intended to do or who I intended doing.
“Long Joe, looking over the fence, saw me
and I chatted him. He passed me his ticket
and 1 sneaked into the stand enclosure on
that.
“For the same reason, I suppose, that a
THE TRIER.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you are looking so blue about—I’ve promised you I’m
going to try and learn how to love.”
“Yes, but- you didn’t tell me I should have to watch you taking lessons from the
whole darned ship’s company.”
hungry dog has another look at a bare bone,
I strolled over to have a look at Rippling
Rufus. There was a bit of a crowd round
his stall, and on my way down I was
blocked a bit while they cleared —when you’re
holding nothing, and with the Dog Act
barkin’ at y'. ain’t the time to push in and
elbow people out of your way. I stood back
and waited.
“In front of me there were a couple of
fellows looking like money from the mint.
“‘I tell you,’ one was saying, ‘that Chil-
lagoes are a good thing. They’re sixpence
now, and I give you my word they’ll be
three and six in less than a month. The
Government’s going to buy ; and when that
gets out the price’ll go like wild-fire.’
“One of the fellows turned, saw me look-
ing and nudged his mate. The other fellow
had one look at me and sniffed.
“ ‘Oh, him !’ he snorted, and went on with
his talk.
“Other people edged away and gave me a
chance to have a look at Rippling Rufus.
He was a chestnut, a blaze down his face and
two white feet. I can see him now as I
tell you of it. And of the two of us it’d
take a lawyer and a beauty judge to say
which looked the more miserable.
“Rufus was standing right, his eyes were
bright enough and keen, but he looked the
picture of misery. His hair was all turned
the wrong way, like a French hen caught
out in the rain—he looked like a bad dream
come true. And he was the horse I’d
fancied for the big race! He was the rock
I was using as a foundation to build me a
recovery, and on the chance of that freak I
reckoned I’d dodge jumping the rattler! I
never did like the smell of a scour in work.
I don’t know whether it was the thought of
the scour, smell at Westbourne playing on
my empty stomach, or whether it was the
look of Rufus, but I felt sick straight away.
“During the running of the three races
before the big un I’d managed to stow away
eleven and six. I had a drink with Long
Joe, him shouting, and that left me. enough
to have a ticket on Rufus, if I wanted to
murder me money, to have another drink on
my own and to pay a bob for a ride back to
town. I’d chance getting supper somewhere,
and then it was me for the rattler in the
morning.
“Rufus trotted out and did his preliminary.
The wise ones giggled as he came oiit, rear-
ing and playing about like a nervous horse
will, and the books opened up at eight to
one. Tripole was favorite—even money and
hard to get. Rufus did his prelim., swung
round and trotted back down the straight in
front of the grandstand. He locked crook
before he come out, but now he was like a
futurist’s nightmare. He was a lather of
foam, and everywhere the sweat was wet on
him, which was all over, the froth stood out
like the top of a queen pudding. He came
pretty close to me, where I was leaning
over the rails, and as he trotted past I made
tracks for the tote.
“I had work to do, and I got to it with
both hands. Rufus was still a virgin on the
tote, and when I asked for his number, push-
ing in me ten bob, the tote clerk smiled.
Then I looked for Long Joe. I talked —the
words ran from me in a crystal stream of
eloquence! Whatever else I’d ever done,
and whoever else I’d helped to do, I’d never
scaled a friend. Long Joe lent me, a quid.
“By that time Rufus was at tens. I put
that quid in the sink and looked for Tom
Shultz. With the practice I’d had on Joe I
was able to spring a better tale on Tom.
He lent me two notes.
“Rufus was at fifteens by this time, and
I knew there was a fall coming. I bustled
round and give a lifelike imitation of a
busy man. I borrowed from all I knew till
they dodged when they saw’ me coming, and
then, for.the first and last time in my. life, I
turned urger. I touched the big punter of
the town.
“ ‘What is it?’ says he, letting me know by
his manner that three and a half seconds
was my limit.
“When I told him Rufus he laughed.
“‘Listen!’ I says, quick. ‘Listen to the
books. Two minutes ago he was fifteen. Hear
’em now' callin’ tens. Get your money in
quick. Put a wad on him ! Soak it! Splash
it! This is the chance of two lifetimes!
Never, since y’ left yer baby’s cot, has easy
money come lookin’ for y’ to pick it off the
trees.’
“I told him a lot. more, my words running
on top of one another and catching up with
each other when I stopped to take breath.
And then he said he’d chance a bit on him.
“A bit, did I say! I trotted beside him,
and when we got to the betting ring . I’d
worked him to chance fifty!
“And all the time the price of Rufus is
coming down. Tens, eights, sixes, fours,
twos —four to one Tripole—and by the time
the fifty was landed the average of it worked
out at about fives. I’d done my work, I’d
spread my net, and I waited for my harvest
to bloom.
“Rufus, decorated like a wedding-cake,
was playing up at the barrier, making a
fool of himself generally. And every time
he swung round there was a splather of
foam sent floating in the air.
“They’re off! For a second or two my
heart stood still, then it jumped up into my
throat, threatenin’ to choke me, and then it
went well. \
“Rufus was lying third, pulling two double
and racing as easy and quiet as Mary’s
little lamb. At the six he went to the front,
and that was the end of the section. Rufus
come in, makin’ no mistake, and the judge
hoisted his number. The ‘All Right’ flag
went up, and the books shouted sweet music:
‘l’ll pay Rippling Rufus.’ ”
Durant stretched himself and chuckled.
“By jove,” lie continued, “that _was a
coup. Tim Davies, the most secretive and
cunning trainer in the West, had Rufus then,
and that was the trick he worked. All sorts
of rumors floated about, and all sorts of
theories were given. Only two men knew —
he and I. With the two hundred won I
stalled off the policeman who threatened
me under the vag., bought Chillagoes at
sixpence, sold them in less than a month for
two and nine, and since then Well, you
know how things are with me !”
“But what was the trick? There’s Mrs.
Public-house getting ready to ring the bell
for lunch. What was it?”
“It was just a fluke,” Durant explained.
“When I was a youngster another boy and I
went to wash a pony. To make a good job of
it I rubbed him lightly with a damp bar of
kerosene soap before commencing to wash
him. Both of us were called away before
we’d applied the water. When we came
back in about an hour’s time, after the
soap had dried, the pony looked like a
feather-pillow oozing its stuffing. His coat
was turned the wrong way, he looked like
a visit to the infirmary and fit for tin' old-
age and invalid pensions.. And as Rippling
Rufus trotted back down the straight after
doing his preliminary, and just as he passed
me, I got a distinct whiff of kerosene soap!”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I SWAM back to consciousness through
a black sea of horrid dreams and opened
my eyes to a dazzling sky which made
them ache. I quickly closed them, and
began to think, my mind troubled, but my
memory clear. That morning early, or per-
haps the day before, we had charged the
Turkish trenches. I remembered stumbling
across rough ground and falling twice, only
to rise again and plod breathlessly along,
with familiar figures on my right, and left.
Then suddenly I was alone in an inferno of
noise, and as a cold feeling of terror came
into my heart I felt a jarring shock and
then —blackness.
I had been hit, then; and I wondered
about my mates, if they were still alive.
I did not feel hunger or thirst, nor was I
conscious of pain, but I wondered if I was
badly hurt, and tried to lift my head. This
I could not do, but I could turn it sideways,
and again I opened my eyes. A foot or so
away there lay another man, a young officer,
badly hurt, as I could see, and moving his
head and moaning.
Between us, near my elbow, there lay on
the ground a small bottle of iodine, from
the field dressing, a familiar enough object;
and I thought of the advice of a troopship
M.O. to use iodine promptly if wounded. I
tried to reach my hand towards the bottle,
and found that I could not move. It is a
terrible feeling to have the will to move
a limb yet not to move.
The bottle of iodine, so close, tormented
my thoughts. The young officer, lying near,
was racked with pain and thirst, and he
was crying for water, but I knew nothing
but the passionate desire to grasp the bottle
in my fingers. I felt that if I could but
do this everything would be well with me,
and I struggled to lift my hand. Then a
wave of nausea engulfed me and I sank
again into a deep sleep.
When I awoke it seemed like afternoon,
and I felt a small and nagging pain in my
head; I found that I could lift it a little, and
opened my eyes and looked around. The man
lying next to me had turned upon his side,
and his eyes were fixed upon the bottle of
iodine, towards which his hand was slowly
moving.
“That’s mine!” I muttered thickly.
He looked at me and grinned a little. I
saw liis hand slowly moving towards the
bottle, his fingers outstretched.
“Blast you.’’ I said, “that’s mine!”
I struggled and struggled to move, and
nearly fainted again as I felt my right
arm move. So now it was a race between
us, the officer and the trooper, both sorely
stricken, for the tiny bottle which to our
inflamed minds possessed such vast import-
ance! The glaring sky blazed down, aloof.
I did not care now if I lived or died, but I
must have the iodine to pour upon my
wounds. I twisted my head as far as I
could, and glared at him with hate and
jealousy, all the time striving desperately
to reach the bottle with my creeping hand,
which moved in jerks, a fraction of an inch
at a time.
My rival was getting closer to ~he tiny
thing than I, however, and. despite alter-
nate waves of nausea and blackness, I
struggled on. lying there motionless except
for the slight movements of my hand. Glar-
ing still at my opponent. I fancied him, too.
almost fainting: but there was something
like triumph in his eyes as his look encount-
ered mine.
Further his hand crept, faster than I could
move, until a bare half-inch lay between i!
and the bottle. I knew now that I could
never reach the iodine, and I wept peevishly
in disappointment. No triumph appeared now
in the grey face so close to mine, and I watched
again his groping fingers, now almost touch-
ing the neck of the bottle. I thought glee-
fully for a moment that he was going to
miss it: then, his eyes on mine, his fingers
closed around it.
I stared, hating him beyond all imagining:
then, with a quick effort—he pushed the
bottle into my hand!
Six weeks later I woke in a London hospi-
tal bed. But I never saw the officer again.
Perhaps he died there at Lone Pine.

Two Towns.
TWO towns in one town,
Flagged both with stones,
One full of living men.
One full of bones.
That town of live men
Keeps its streets clean ;
No trailer on the stones,
No grass between.
That town of dead men
Lets the boughs blow,
Lets silver urchins bud,
Lets daisies grow'.
Yet all the quick folk,
w nun their days pass,
Sloven of boughs will be,
Slattern of grass.
Ail those astir now,
Tidy and blind,
End under silver buds,
Feckless and kind.

The Renegade
CROM little house to little office stool
He turned his steps, a pilgrim pitiful,
Who owned no beauty in the budding day,
Nor grace in tapered trees that, trembling,
sway
Back from the warm, soft ardor of the
breeze.
Like maids grown fearful of sought
ecstasies.
He saw no wonder in the youngest green;
He saw no wonder in a world washed clean
By skyey waters and the wind’s wild
broom—
He who once wove liis dream on Nature’s
loom!
He went his way, nor any wonder heard
In the inspired piping of a bird;
Nor knew the worth of wonder till he came
On gods enchained by man, by man made
tame ;
At senseless, hurtling car and thund’ring
train
He stared in stupid pride, and stared again ;
And saw (God save him!) beauty on a
throne
In a dead wilderness of labored stone.
But I have seen, when other men were far,
His tired eyes lifted to a distant star;
And I have seen—and I would see no more—-
The hurt lost soul of him, when_ on some
shore
The singing waves their siren-message sped
To all that he had hoped was cold and dead.
From little stool to little, heated house
lie will retrace his steps, a homing mouse,
With thought of warmth and little belly full,
He who once thought to wander with the
gull;
He goes in dreary ease, with dull esteem
Of dull men, guerdon for a murdered dream.

The Voices.
HE “chucked it in” beside the long, dry
track
And watched the shadows as they crept
Across old wheel-marks, climbing whitened
gums.
With fitful sleep, forgotten days came back.
Night passed; and waltzing with a clinging
hand
The brazen breath of cold, grey dawn
Came plucking at his scanty rags, to join
A clumsy whirl of madness on the sand.
Up from the earth where hungry he had
lain.
Though dazed with belly craving food.
Tie rose and cursed to greet the new-born
glare,
Another dreadful day—and slogged again.
Once more came night, bringing an early
moon
To watch him stumbling on the endless plain,
A dying man, delirious and dewed with
sweat.
The saltbush whispered to the wind, “Not
yet?”
And softly came the answer, “No—but soon !”

BUSH-DREAMS uiui sea-dreams of lons
ago,
Of knights and Crusades and triumphing
right,
Of jesters twirling on lissome toe,
And angels of God in shining white
Turn all to a fleer, Don Quixote youth;
For humor is always bought and read,
You who dreamed that the aim of all was
Truth.
For you’re eating your heart,
You’re eating your heart,
You’re eating your heart for your daily
bread.
Did your thoughts like homing bees fly to
God
One Spring when you walked with arch-
angels seven,
And the early flowers as they burst the sod
Were each a censer that flamed to Heaven
Paeans of joy that you were chosen
To follow the path where His feet had led.
Catch the Spirit’s gleam though your soul's
long frozen,
For you’re eating your heart,
You’re eating your heart,
You’re eating your heart for your daily
bread.
Did you catch Romance on a wind-swept hill,
When the broom was heady and lupins
sweet;
Did you dream that the world stood shyly
still,
That the lips of lovers might lingering
meet?
Quick while the scent yet grips your throat
And the pulse still stirs that you thought
long dead,
Catch up your pencil and make your note,
For you’re eating your heart,
You’re eating your heart,
You’re eating your heart for your daily
bread.
Did you dream of a house so starkly set
On the bank of a river brown and wide?
Did you hang its casements with daffodil
net.
And greenly cushion its broad fireside?
Did you plant the borders to find that day,
When you thought that joy lay for ever
dead,
Not you, but some other would keep them
gay?
Re-live the agony ere it’s fled—
You're eating your heart,
You’re eating your heart for your daily
bread !
The secret sin and the secret shame,
Your Garden of Olives, your crown of
thorn,
Now time has blurred grief’s withering
flame,
And blunted the edge of man’s fierce scorn ;
Sweat blood again in Gethsemane,
Cry out to your God who still hides His face ;
Savor the night when your burst heart
bled,
Then fashion a poem that stabs fiercely—
You’re eating your heart,
You’re eating your heart for your daily
bread !
Friends all, when in decent graves we lie,
And the candle’s burned, and the prayers
are said,
Will we know any difference, you and I.
Who have eaten our hearts for our daily
bread?

The Shower.
SINCE dawn the laughing clouds have
chased
Blue gleams across the sky—
Oh, day of stormy sun and breeze,
Of changing, glittering fantasies.
Are you more glad than I?
I look upon gold-chequered heath
By a peacock-colored sea,
White tea-tree branches weighed with flower,
Massed wedding-bush that builds a bower
Of star-wrought ivory.
I hear the larks in climbing praise,
The cuckoos' velvet call,
The midget wrens that must rejoice,
And a blackbird’s lialf-articulate voice,
The loveliest of all.
The wind scoops diamonds from the waves,
The tea-tree drips with pearl;
Up pathways whence October came
Their high-held coral-pink and flame
Watsonia flags unfurl.
There’s not a bird or blossom heart
But wakes a throb in mine—
You day of gold and white and blue,
Say that you love my love so true,
it with a sign !
Cool kisses brush my upturned face
In benediction swift!
At once the day is ten times fair
When crystal buds through all the air
Burst into water drift.
No cloud dims Heaven’s glorious eye,
The shower has passed again ;
But for a moment, flashing free,
Cod from his nearness smiled on me
In fine, sun-silvered rain.

The Meadow.
HOW sweet it w r as in fairy time to wander
there, just you and I,
Among the drowsy clover-heads be-
neath the pearly morning sky ;
You w'oro a little gown of blue to match the
hare-bells growing there,
And I a shabby suit of brown which often
held a ragged tear;
Our laughter drifted on the breeze that whis-
pered in the eglantine,
All through the golden summer days, when I
was yours and you were mine.
We used to gather perfumed briar, and many
a rosy flower-chain
We wove to deck the lattice gate to lure the
wee folk back again.
We did not hear them come, but saw the
Avhiteness of their dancing feet
And glimpsed the silver of a wing among
the dewy grasses sweet.
Nor did we see them go, yet sensed the pass-
ing of a joyous wind
That smelled of dreaming mignonette, where
lazy bees their treasure find.
And you and I were left alone beneath the
friendly glowing moon
To gaze across the gleaming grass, which
fairy feet had left too soon;
And when at last we reached the gate and
turned once more, hand clasped in hand,
For one last look on what we called, in
whispered words, our fairy land,
We saw the sapphire hare-bells swing first
up, then downwards out of sight,
And knew they pealed a golden chime to bid
us both a last good-night.
All through the days that followed on, the
gods of laughter loved us well,
And played with us beneath the sun till
purple shades of evening fell.
Within our meadow flowers shone and mag-
pies piped to us their lays,
While with a richer melody the thrushes
sang of springtime days.
The sweet briar berries turned to brown
which in its turn flamed ruby red,
And joyously with needles bright we strung
them on a cotton thread
And looped them on your sun-kist arms and
bound them in your dusky hair,
Or knotted them about your dress to hide the
shabby places there;
Then as you stood against the hedge and
shyly peeped among its green
I bared my head and bent the knee, and then
and there proclaimed you Queen.
You reached a gracious hand to me and
smiled your sunny little smile
And cried, “Ah, then if I am Queen, you
surely will be King awhile?’’
But that was in the long ago when we were
children, you and I;
And now I’m waiting all alone beneath the
pearly morning sky.
(How sweet the breeze in fairy time that
whispered in the eglantine,
All through the golden summer days, when I
was yours and you were mine!)
I gaze across the gleaming grass to where
the hare-bells, w'et with dew,
Are surely pealing joyous chimes because
they know I wait for you!

Rings.
ON my neighbor’s hands are rings,
Oostlv little jewelled things—
Sapphires like a blue-bird's wings,
Diamonds, faceted with light,
Turquoises and rubies bright,
Blent in lovely sliimmerings.
Not a sparkling gem have I
My toil-worn hands to beautify,
Or in my jewel-case to lie;
No Orient pearls of lustrous sheen,
With opals color-ripe between,
Or soft-lined lapis lazuli.
But all the day my glad heart sings,
For round each finger softly clings
A wealth of tiny, glistening rings;
No gems of trade —I have instead
The ringlets on my baby’s head.
Such winsome, golden, precious things.

Vale!
THAT this should come to me who love
the gold
Of humblest field-flower, by the world
unseen ;
To whom the rose-lipped clouds of even unfold
A thousand beauties in their pearly sheen !
Never again to see! Only the night
Unlit by stars, unsilvered by the moon,
Moving in dark and unrelenting flight
Across the blueness of my sky at noon.
Some precious months—at most a wing&d
year—
To store within my thirsty soul and brain
The beauty of the things I hold most dear,
t\ hose glory I shall never see again.
How I shall plan each day! To see and hold
Each treasured vision that mine eyes may
keep
When sight has gone, and grey is one with
gold,
And fairest waking-time is one with sleep!
I shall be there to greet the earliest day,
To see the sun a band of ribbon fling,
And loop the islands far across the bay
To these brown beaches where the sea-
weeds cling.
At evening I shall see above the trees
The clouds like tired ships at anchor lie,
Safe from the boist’rous frolic of the breeze.
Within the harbor of the quiet sky.
Only the dark will homeward turn my feet ;
Even I grudge the hours that sleep de-
mands.
Time for that afterwards! But, oh, how
fleet
Kun through the glass the unrelenting
sands!
Out of this chaos comes a thought to me —
That, never seeing, yet a Face I know
Holds all the beauty of Eternity,
The peace that only love can e’er bestow.
This will I hold to when the dark shall
creep,
Like some spring-tide of ruthless, moving
sea
Across my sands of sight. This will I keep—
The inward vision that remains to me.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SIX months ago the Gentlemen’s Hosiers
and Mercers in Kaley-street had been
a bright little up-to-date store. It was
one of a row acquired by Joel Egelbaum, a
soft-goods warehouseman and buyer of old
properties as a side-line. It was Egelbaum's
custom to fit up and stock such shops with
goods to suit the tenant—on terms that
suited himself —and, a mercer’s being a profit-
able proposition, he found two young men
who, having nothing more to lose, agreed to
give it a run. They had opened in the
autumn, and the bright hose, smart shirts and
ties made an oasis in a desert of drab
dwellings, and the placard telling the passers-
by that "What is shown in our windows
to-day will be in the city next week” did
not raise the derision you’d suppose. But
toggery that looks classy in April looks
passe by September. The windows bore
a meagre and stretched-out appearance.
Shirts that usually shrink coyly into their
folds, displaying to the public but a small
portion of front and a pair of cuffs, were
hanging their full uneven length, and
“Military Sox” that had formed fours on
the flat of the window were now ranged
in single file. The interior was vast and
empty*.
Monday evening the shop was closed ; the
elder partner had been to the city on a
futile quest to obtain some spring goods on
credit.
“What did you get?” asked the other.
“Nix, Mark; these damn wholesalers got a
nark on us—wouldn’t trust me with a bone
collar-stud.”
“Egelbaum’s blocked us, I expect. Did
you try him?”
“Nothing doin'. Said he wanted to see
the color of our money before we got another
penn’orth from him. Reckoned we was no
better than cheats —nearly insulted me, he
did. Something’ll have to be done or we’ll
be out on our ears before we know where
we are.”
“I ain’t craving to stay ; this rag line's no
game for fly chaps,” replied his partner.
"They were the times, when we went into
the Backblocks and shlentered the yokes!
Remember the nice bit we cleaned up at
Bilboo races. 'The open life, and free,
Flaunel-flowers in the bush, Wattle on the
tree.’ ” carolled Mark.
“You wasn’t so shook on the bush when wo
were in it; and, anyway, it ain’t what it
was—the yokes ain’t biting these days.”
Lew was some years older than his com l
panion, and the open life and free held no
glamor for him; the safe and respectable
was all lie desired now.
“Well, I don't see anything in paying
Egelbaum four quid a week rent and twenty
per cent, too much on tin 1 goods and furni-
ture.”
“He never got it, so what yer kicking at?
And we was doin’ all right till you went
to liandwick and dropped all our bundD
on”
"There you go, always whipping the cat.”
“Well, something’s got to be done. Sup-
pose you get engaged, Mark?”
“What for? There’s nobody I want to
get engaged to.”
“That’s good then. What would you say
to a nice widder, a German lady?”
“I'd say so long.”
“You don’t know what yer chucking. You
ain’t thinking.”
“If it’s such a good spec, why don’t yer
take it on yerself?”
“A fat charnce I’d stand. But you, now.
you’re young and smart and slioin,” coaxed
Lew
“She may not have me. Every woman
ain’t struck on good looks,” demurred
Mark. “Anyway, you ain’t so much older.”
“Quite a bit I am. I reckon when you
was putting hooks and hangers on yer little
slate I was putting ’em on ladies' mantles.”
“What she like to look at?”
“She ain't a surf-queen, lout she’s tail-
got a good carriage, as they say.”
“A good car'd be better. Who is she?”
“She’s a Mrs. Bloom—Rose Bloom. Nice
name, ain’t it?”
“Pity ter change it. How'd you get to
know her?”
“I met her at my cousin Leah’s. So much
jewel’ry I never seen outside a pawnshop
winder.”
“You didn't say what sort of dial she's
got.”
Lew was not apt in his similes. “I didn’t
notice much. She’s got nice eyes, like —
like brown raisins in a suety puddin’.”
“Gord !” gasped the fastidious Mark. “It’s
no go. Lew; I ain’t marryin’ a suety
puddin’.”
“Did I say about marryin’?” asked Lew
craftily. “I said to get engaged.”
“Don't it come to the same thing?”
“Not with you it don’t, or you'd be mar-
ried to that girl at Bondi : or the flash
piece up in the mountains; and”
“All right! All right! I ain't a Mormon
trust. Suppose—l only say suppose—l did
get engaged to this Mrs. Bloom, I don’t see
how it’ll do us any good.”
“It would, worked proper. If Egelbaum
thought you was goin’ to marry a rich w'idder
he’d wait a bit longer for his account and
maybe come over with some spring stock.
And perhaps Mrs. B.’ll get int’rested and
take a share in the biz, and tve’ll get goin’
ail right again.”
But the rosy vision of the elder man was
only a dark cloud to Mark, till suddenly he
perceived a silver lining—silver-grey to be
exact, and it belonged to a new spring suit.
“I’ll think it over. But I got to get some
new clothes.”
“What’s the matter with yer pinhead
woosted cleaned and yer blue serge pressed ?”
“Can’t yer see me gettin’ about with a
rich widder cleaned and pressed. I’ll have
one of them bluey-greys and a soft felt hat
to go with it. and two or three fine-stripe
shirts” ——■
“If yer take three shirts outer stock we’ll
have to close up one of the winders.”
“Don’t worry, we ain’t got none in stock
like I mean.”
“Don’t forget yer Oxford bags,” reminded
Lew in line sarcasm.
“I was cornin’ to them —flannels and a
sports-coat.”
“Merslmgger, pore chap !” said Lew, touch-
ing his forehead. “Imagines lie’s the Prince
o’ Wales. Ramblin’ a bit ago about flannel-
flowers an’ now it’s flannel trousis.”
WHEN AFTER IS BEFORE.
DAD. “I don't believe he wants to buy any sheep really. I believe he just comes after
dinner.”
MUM : “Why, he always comes just before dinner, father!”
DAD: “Well, isn’t that what I said, mother?”
Neither ridicule, sarcasm nor plain argu-
ment could induce Mark to moderate his de-
mands. “No suits, no suitor” was his ulti-
matum. Moreover his watch would have to
come out if he had to cart that widder round.
He’d want to know the first minute he could
shunt her. Lew gave in. “Good-bye the bit
I urns keepin’ in hand for the Spring meet-
ing,” lie said bitterly. “But see here, Beau
Brum, yer don’t start dolling yerself up till
you’ve met her and come to an under-
standin’!”
“Make a meet then, you're the shadcan.”
On the appointed evening Mark was loung-
ing at the door of the shop. Though he was
awaiting the arrival of the lady of his part-
ner’s choice, his thoughts were entirely sar-
torial. The new' suit would do if Nathan
could ease out that break under the left
shoulder-blade. The “Borsaleener” was a
ringer for the Duke's, and he’d have a
hardhitter as well. If lie could wangle
“Is dis nomber eight?”
His prospective fiancee! The prospect did
not please. Standing beside her he felt
dwarfed, for the lady was an 0.0.5. and the
mercer barely medium-sized. He piloted her
inside while Lew hurried forward to make
the unnecessary introduction. She glanced
round the bare shop.
“We’ve had a sale,” Lew explained.
Mrs. Bloom nodded. “Yer’ good sale.”
Lew noted then and after that, though her
words were few, they were always to the
point.
They went into the living-room, where Lew
set out refreshments. As the chair Mark
placed for the widow groaned beneath her,
so did he groan in spirit. True, not all the
ladies he had favored with his brief regard
had been beautiful; still Mark had never
yet squeezed a hand that took sevens, nor
put his arm round a forty-four waist. “It's
goin’ to be a short engagement,” he decided.
Lew was intent upon showing off all
Mark’s points. “Tell Mrs. Bloom the story
of the Rabbi and the trifer butcher—it’ll
make her laugh, Marky.”
“Know anything for Saturday?” asked
Mark instead.
“You shouldn’t be talking about races to a
lady,” chided Lew. He hadn’t pumped her
about betting, and Mark might be putting
his foot in it.
“Sh’pose,” said the lady. “Everyone talks
about der racing. Dere’s a horse called
Motor-car.”
“Never heard of it. There’s one Auto may
be running at”
“Dat’s der von ; it will vin.”
“Never!” said Mark.
“It vill. I know r . Vot price could you
get.?”
“Twenty to one, easy.”
“Ver’ well,” said the widow, taking a ten-
pound note from her purse; “put dis on for
me for venever it runs.”
Mrs. Bloom did not stay late. While Mark
went for a taxi Lew completed the negotia-
tions. He found the widow most trusting
and liberal. She did not inquire too closely
into Mark’s bank balance —which was non-
existent —nor show any wash to examine the
books —that were never kept. Probably, her
first husband having been quite old enough
to be her father, she sought to balance the
score with fate by taking a second nearly
young enough to be her son, and considered
youth and good looks a fair exchange for
money and maturity.
Mark did not know if courtesy demanded
he should see the lady home, and if it did he
wasn’t going to; so after tucking her into the
taxi he went back to his partner.
“She’s a good sort,” Lew began, “and
when you’re married”
“I never said I’d marry her. I’d sooner
go through the Bankruptcy Court.”
“No Bankruptcy Court for us boys! Who
d’.ver think we are—Ant’ny Hordern's ?
What’ll happen is this. Egelbaum’ll send
down the truck, with that great goy who
was once a pug—him with the broken nose —
and he’ll sling everything on it, and if we
would want as much as a change for our-
selves he’ll hand us something that’ll keep
us in Sydney ’Orspital fer a month.”
Mark put bis fate to the touch. “We’ll
toss for it. Heads I’m booked, tails I’m free,
best two out of three.”
The coin was spun and twice showed
heads.
Lew was jubilant. “Now, that’s settled.
Marky, we’ll have a conf’rence. I must say
she wasn’t sweet about putting a lot into
this place, but she’ll buy a garage or some
good goin’ concern. Now, I ain’t askin’
anything for the intro.; all I want is we
shall go on bein’ pardners, and I don’t think
fifty-fifty would be too much.”
“Fifty-fifty stouslies on yer dilly kop
wouldn’t be any too much,” roared Mark.
"Oh, yes. I’m to be loaded with a fifteen-
stone widder you’ve wished on me, this
liosebloom—Gordelpus ! —and you’re to roll
round free as a spare tyre and take half.
Like Hell!" Lew closed the conf’rence hur-
riedly.
* S: * *
“What do you know about this?” said
Hark, coming in with some sporting papers.
"Three of ’em arc tipping Auto fer the Fly-
ing.”
"Well, you’re on velvet.”
; Mark shed his assurance. “I ain’t Lew,
I’ll tell you the truth. I had nothing else in
me mind but to get the best price I could on
Auto when I spotted Bedelia.”
“Oi, oi! A slioin punter, my pardner!”
“She looked a winner, was well backed,
she went out at five to two and”
“And romped home at a quarter ter three.
I know yer winners, and why didn’t yer tell
Mrs. B.?”
I meant to, but she was so set on this
!darsted Auto I let it go—didn’t think he had
a chance. Gord! It’ll be running in a few
minutes. You were brought up froom; can’t
yer say a prayer?”
Forgot em all. And, anyway, I never
knew one that’d pull a horse.”
Lew,” said Mark that evening, “my
Rosebud 11 be here in a couple of shakes,
so I m beating it. Give her the strength of
the Auto sliermozzle and get it over before
1 come back.”
Mark was gone before Lew could give
him the strength of his tongue. At the top
of the street lie bumped Doris. Doris
served soft drinks and cigarettes at the
shop on the corner of Ivaley-street, where
Mark was a frequent customer. She had
big brown eyes, trimmed with lashes to
match, and wasn’t one of those outsized
creatures who make a man feel like tuppence
ha’p’ny. in their company. She confided to
Mark it was her night off and she had
arranged to go to the pictures, but her
girl friend had slipped her up, and she
was that disappointed she could cry. A
girl felt a fool going back home again, but
she couldn’t mooch about by herself. The
brown eyes looked up appealingly from under
those long lashes. The poor little thing claimed
liis sympathy. Mark forgot the weightier
claim now on her way to Kaley-street and
promptly offered his escort. He got home
in time to miss his fiancee, but had to face
Lew’s upbraidings.
“Why didn’t yer come back? She wasn’t
very sour.”
“She’s worse when she’s sweet, that’s
why.”
“You should be ashamed to treat a lady
that way. You fergit she ain’t some short-
skirt flapper you’ve got a date with.”
“I don't fergit, that’s the trouble.”
“Well, you take care how you play fast and
loose with her. Rich widders ain’t hanging
on trees fer you.”
“One I know could be fer me.”
Doris’s good-night kisses were still warm
on his lips and lfad gone a bit to his head :
and thereafter he saw her pretty often, but
not on. the widow’s evenings.
Coming unexpectedly one night, Mrs.
Bloom found Lew alone. He was arrang-
ing the windows. The business having
benefited by a little ready cash, Lew was
making two shirts to show where only one
had shown before.
“Marky’s out. He’ll be that sorry to miss
yer!”
“Yah! I saw him talking mit a leetle
sliicksli at der top of der street.”
“Some gal he met by chance.”
“Und lie takes to der pictures by chance?”

150 Automotive Engineers
Could Agree on an Ideal Car
Wouldn’t you like to own that car?
They

The Metropolitan Section of the Society
of Automotive Engineers held a contest
in January for the design of an “ideal
Car.’’
1 50 automotive engineers competed for
the prize. The specifications submitted
by the contestants were synthetized into
a composite set of specifications for an
“Ideal Car” —that dream of all engineers
-—that hope of all automobile owners.

It has neither a four-bearing crankshaft nor yet a three but a seven-bearing
crankshaft, as has the Flying Cloud.
It has a bore and stroke neither more nor less than x sin., but exactly the

The pistons are not cast iron they are aluminium, as are those of the Flying Cloud.
It has neither a worm-gear final drive nor a hypoid gear final drive but a spiral

In almost every detail the Flying Cloud speci-
fications are exactly similar to those of the
Engineer’s Ideal Car. This partly explains
the phenomenal sales of the Flying Cloud in
America since its introduction in January
last.
Named after the well-known American
Clipper, the Flying Cloud, famed in the middle
of last century for her speed and graceful
lines, the Flying Cloud car brings to motor-
dom a new idea of car performance.
The Flying Cloud is a pleasure car, low slung
with clean sweeping lines, capable of ex-
tremely rapid acceleration and high sustained
speed. This car will give to every motorist that
“something” which his own good car lacks.
Four Wheel Internal Expanding Hydraulic
Brakes, Hydraulic Shock Absorbers on all

Vibration Damper; Motor-Rubber Floated at
four Suspension Points; Full Balloon Tyres,
Bumpers front and rear; Bodies in the Conti-

Refinements hitherto found only in the most
expensive cars are standard equipment of
the Flying Cloud.

“I'll run fetch him,” said Lew uneasily.
“Nein,” said Mrs. Bloom decidedly. “Look,
I haf brought a ring that was my husband’s.
I vant my next husband shall vear it.” She
slipped it on Lew’s finger, a fine single-stone
diamond ring.
A pang of envy troubled Lew. “It’ll have
to be made smaller fer Mark,” he said, tak-
ing it off.
“Nein, keep it, if you like.”
“But you said for your next husband.”
“So,” said the widow, and smiled. She
had a pleasing smile, and to Lew’s thinking
was altogether desirable. Well, if Mark was
mug enough to throw away his good luck,
others——
His arm slid round her waist and did not
find it too ample. The widow was well con-
tent.
When Mark kissed Doris good-bye that
night she told him archly he might take
another, as it would probably be the last;
her regular boy was coming from Newcastle
and might think it a bit over the odds if
he found her going about with another
fellow.
Mark had often to employ much craft
and many lies in getting out of his various
entanglements, yet he was not at all pleased
that the lady in this case had relieved him
of the necessity. What a fool he had been
wasting time and money on a sly little hussy
who had another feller in tow all the time she
was stringing him along; and to risk losing
the widow for her—he must have been dillv !
His thoughts as they turned to his fiancee
were more kindly now. Here was someone
worth while —that fond of him she thought
the sun shone out of his face. Wasn’t
jealous, like most women so much older; let
a feller have lots of rope. But he wasn’t
going to play up any more; he’d get married
and settle down. By the time he reached
home he was shaking hands with himself at
his easy get-out.
He slept late next morning and woke to a
strange silence. No sound of Lew getting
breakfast ready, nor of the door opening to
admit a chance customer. He jumped up.
Where could Lew be?
A billhead on the table caught his eye.
and he turned it over. “Rosie and me.” he
read, “are getting married to-day. Rosie
says she wants fer her husband to run after
her and not other girls. I give you the biz-
ness and you should do all right if you
keep away from the gees. Rosie says to
keep the diamond pin she gave you and the
gold links — Lew.” There was a P.S.: “Jam-
pot’s got a charnee in the Cracker jack Stakes
at Campo Park Saterday.”
Wearing the bluey-grey with the “Borsa-
leener” perched on his curly head and twenty
good quid in 1 his pocket, Mark felt well
equipped for the road he meant to travel.
He passed into the street and, closing the
door for ever on dull shopkeeping, turned to
follow the more attractive occupation known
as “living on the game.”
* * * *
In the back vard of a weatherboard house
on Sunbaked Flat a young man was chop-
ping wood. Between every stroke he cursed,
none the less heartily that liis tea depended
upon those logs being chopped and stacked.
He was unkempt, his boots were past patching
and his clothing as frayed as his temper.
A little girl ran out with a letter. He
opened it: —
Dear Mark, —My cousin Leah’s boy, the eldest one,
says he seen you in Sunbaked Flat. I reckon you
wouldn’t mind ter come back to Sydney. Rose has
bought me a going concern, a shootin gallery with
movin ducks and seterers. There’s room fer another
here, a good sprooker like yerself. If so be yer
want ter come you’ll find a money order. I’d have
liked to have writ a cheque, but Rose reckins they’ll
change the M.O. quicker.—Lew.
Mark straightened his back and buried the
hatchet in the logs without knowing his
action was symbolical.
“I suppose,” he said, “a proper pal lets
bygones be bygones to give a cobber a helping
hand. So I’ll go to Lew, as it seems he
needs me; but consid’ring he’s got the widder
and everything that by rights is mine, I
don’t think fifty-fifty is asking too much. And
before I even begin to talk biz he’ll have to
spring me some new clobber.”
MARCO.
Two Bottles and a Lady.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tile poignancy of grief for the son who
had found a grave in France had long
softened into a sorrow that was almost a
joy in its beauty; but always that badge on
the coat of any man stirred her sympathies.
“How sad !” The exclamation was forced
from her. A feeling that she ought to speak
to this poor fellow warred with her natural
timidity, and conquered. She moved along
the seat until opposite to him; then, leaning
forward, she timorously touched his hand.
“My poor young man,” she said gently,
“isn’t it a terrible thing that you should
be in this state?”
He looked up dazedly.
“Born here,” he said shortly. “Goo’ old
Noo Shoush’ll do me.”
“I mean in this condition. I had boys
myself who were soldiers, and one of them
died. Think,” she said softly, “what your
dear mother would feel to see you like this!
You have a mother?”
“She’sh dead !”
“You poor, dear fellow!” breathed Mrs.
Molloy.
The Digger’s tears were soon floating on a
tide of beer, and they ran down his cheeks
under the pressure of this sympathy. Mrs.
Molloy herself was transformed into his
mother; soft, consoling sympathy, gentle re-
proof, she gave him.
He suddenly remembered his stop.
“Here, misshush,” he said, as he rose;
and he planted his two bottles upon what
little of a lap Mrs. Molloy’s stoutness had
left her ; “I’m goin’ to givsh up. Goo’-bye,
dear lady : an' God blesli you !” Awkwardly
he gave her hand a firm clasp that was
almost an embrace as he stumbled off.
Mrs. Molloy’s face flamed red as she
regarded the parcel on her knees: then, in
an embarrassed and stealthy manner, she
put the bottles beside her on the seat, and
with relief that the next stop was hers,
MRS. MOLLOY was a prohibitionist, but
she w r as the sort of woman who would
much sooner wash the wdiisky adver-
tisements from the hoardings rvitli her tears
than snatch them down in violent protest.
Her big, bulging bosom heaved with real
sadness when her eyes fixed on the drunk
with the returned-soldier’s badge who fell
into the tram, and, having dumped his parcel
—obviously two bottles of beer wrapped in
brown paper—on to the seat, sagged in an
affectionate manner beside them.
THE EPICUREAN.
FIRST ISLAND BELLE: “Has your boy got refined tastes?”
SECOND ISLAND BELLE: “I should say so! Why, he wouldn’t dream of eating a
missionary below the rank of a bishop.”
stepped off the tram as the conductor made
way for her.
“Here, missus; you’ve left your parcel,”
called the conductor; and, turning at the
imperative call, she found the two bottles
thrust into her arms. Mrs. Molloy had no
time to reflect that he might have been a
Boy Scout and probably regarded this as
his one good act. She felt she could hardly
drop the bottles in the street, and the con-
ductor and his tram were gone before she
recovered her speech. She was most con-
scious as she moved away with flushed face
—and the beer parcel—that someone had
made a remark that “The old girl likes her
beer.”
Her passage to the office of her daughter,
who ran a typewriting business, was a
path of shame; she was overcome with horror
at the possibility of meeting someone who
knew her.
“It’s your own fault, mother,” said her
daughter severely-—she was the severe type—
“you will go talking to these disreputable
people.”
“I’m sure he wasn’t disreputable, my
dear; only foolish,” expostulated her mother.
“Still, the unfortunate affair is over now.
I can leave the dreadful things here, and
they’ll be removed with the rubbish in the
morning.”
“You certainly will not /” said her
daughter sharply. “Do you think I'm going
to have bottles of beer standing round the
office for my clients or my girls to see? And
what would the cleaner think of me?”
Her mother looked piteously at her, im-
pressed by her argument.
“There’s the liftman ; you might give them
to him. I know he drinks,” said the daughter,
a touch of scorn in the addendum.
There was balefulness in the liftman’s look
as he took them down ; lie aild Miss Molloy
had not got on well together. The elder
lady hesitated nervously until the ground
floor was reached.
“Do you drink?” she asked, as he waited
with the lift-door open.
“What the ’ell's that to do with you?”
he asked in reply.
Mrs. Molloy fled after her daughter, who
had superciliously left her to her fate and
was waiting in the doorway.
"Oh. mother, you must get rid of that,”
she said.
“I know, dear,” said Mrs. Molloy, near
the verge of tears.
“Put them down behind the door,” sug-
gested Miss Molloy.
It seemed a good idea; but, although
stooping was rather a task for Mrs. Molloy,
she found that her daughter left her to do
it herself.
“’Ere! You carn’t leave parcels there!”
Mrs, Molloy straightened herself with a
guilty start, and, half turning, saw that
the surly liftman had come out with a sus-
picious air, and was watching. Still with
the bottles, she hurried out like a shooed
fowl.
Outside she almost collided with Mrs.
Button, who was a co-memb.r of the com-
mittee of the Women's No License League.
“My dear, I’m glad to see you, but I’m
in a terrible hurry. I’ll be along to your
party to-night, dear. I notice you have the
same ideas as myself: we believe that drink
should be wiped out. but it is only dutiful
to provide for the tastes of our husbands’
friends in our own homes,” gushed Mrs.
Rufton, her eyes resting on the dreadful
parcel. “I always tell Mr. Rufton to bring
home what lie thinks necessary. Now,
darling, I must be off.”
Mrs. Molloy was a loyal lady, and the
inference that her husband was leaving it to
her to bring home the beer distressed her.
In normal times it would have made her
indignant; but all other feelings were sunk
into one of dismay that the circumstantial
evidence against her was so overwhelming.
“Mother, I have a telegram to send,” said
her daughter, coldly. “You had better go
on, and I’ll meet you at the boat.”
Helplessly Mrs. Molloy let her go. To
thus desert her mother was like -Florence.
When her daughter met her outside the
ferry wharf. Mrs. Molloy was still nursing,
witli a red face, and eyes in which gleamed
tears, the two bottles. She had had a dreadful
series of adventures. Getting into the tram
she had found herself suddenly facing Mr.
Dunlop, president of the Central No-License
Committee, who, whilst he spoke to her in
an unusually uncordial manner, had allowed
his eyes to rest every minute or so upon her
incriminating luggage. His manner was so
accusative that she felt that' any attempt
to explain the situation would seem like
puerile prevarication. She got off the tram
after travelling only a couple of blocks.
Dropping the beer into one of the wire
waste-receptacles, although the idea came
to her with bright hope, proved no good.
She had stood beside the basket, resting
her parcel on the edge while she glanced
around furtively to see that no one was
looking before she dropped it in. Then she
hurried away as if pursued by a devil.*
She w r as. He was a bright boy who chased
her with the parcel, obviously puzzled and
as obviously waiting for his reward. In her
confusion she gave him sixpence and
thanks.
“The old man might've been narked,” re-
marked the youth, with a friendly grin.
Then, mixed with the phantasmagoria of
faces which seemed to be all regarding her
beer-parcel, was the terrible incident of
the crowd she met coming out of a bar.
They looked like men who would accept
beer without question.
“I’ve got a couple of bottles of beer here,”
she began, timorously, standing before one
of them.
“No good to me,” he returned, and then,
with a note of virtuous indignation in his
voice, he said: “I’m a respectable man with
a missus of my own ; an’ it’s shockin’ ter
see a respectabie-lookin’ old woman like you
goin’ on like this. Anyway, if I icas that
way inclined I’d choose a young woman,
an’ ”
But with a horrible realisation of how
she had been misunderstood, and with flaming
cheeks Mrs. Molloy had fled.
She got no sympathy from
her daughter.
“Oh. you’ve still got
them!” said Florence, snap-
pily. “Well, come on, we’ll
get home.”
The quick way in which
she walked ahead separated
her —with obvious intention
—-from her mother, who,
losing her and nursing a
new idea as well as the
bottles, waited until the rush
had gone. The man at the
season-ticket gate knew her.
“I’ve got two bottles of
beer here,” she said, desper-
ately. “You can have
them.”
“Let me have a look at
your ticket,” he said, firmly.
Used to being passed as a
remembered face, she had to
put the bottles down while
she held up the traffic and
groped in her purse for her
ticket.
“I thought you might not
have renewed, and was try-
ing to bribe your way
through,” said the gate-
keeper, with no apology m
his manner. “It’s been done
before —with a beer-bottle
filled with water.”
Mrs. Molloy had desperate
ideas as she hid away in an
obscure corner of the boat,
where, with evident unwillingness, her
daughter joined her. . .. ,
“Give it to one of the engineers; they re
a drunken lot,” prompted Florence.
The man with the oilcan was civil enough
when she approached.
“No thanks, missus,” he said, m response
to her stammered offer. “I can buy all the
beer I want.”
She retreated before the rebuff, and her
cheeks flamed anew when she heard him talk-
ing to the deckhand.
“Cheek these prohibitionists have!” said
the engineer. “They’ll do anything to spoil
a man’s taste fer beer. The old bird doesn t
know that I know she’s a leading cold tea-
ite ; and she comes along trying to palm off
a coupler doctored bottles to kill the
taste.” , , „
Mrs. Molloy didn’t wait long enough to
hear the deckhand's reply: “I’d have taken a
risk anyway!” With an almost demented
rush she moved to the side of the ferry and
hurled the beer overboard.
Molloy himself had not Mrs. Molloy’s
antipathy to liquor.
“That’s deuced awkward,” he said when
he heard the story of his wife’s woes.. “I’ve
asked Morley to come to-night with his wife;
and he’s a man who doesn’t, think, he’s been
well treated unless lie’s given liquor. I
thought it best to prepare Mrs. Rufton
for the presence of b er in the house to-night
bv explaining about Morley; and when she
told me. that she met you bringing some
home I didn’t worry about getting tlm bottles.
Nice mess you’ve landed me in, haven’t you?”

Youth in Love.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
EARLY this morning it was, and dark
As I trailed the drowsy cows,
I saw her break like a strange bright flower
On some broken tea-tree boughs.
She lifted her hand and scooped the last
Pale dregs of the Milky Way,
And washed her cheeks and her brow and
throat
Till they gleamed like the dawning day.
She had filched a brush from an old red fox,
A comb from a golden cock,
And curled her hair till it spun and frothed
To cover her scanty frock.
She tore a strip from the morning wind,
And wound it about her throat,
And pinned the fluttering azure ends
With a thrush’s pointed note.
She rouged her mouth with a rosy cloud
Plucked from the branching east.
And laced her sandals with thongs of hide
From the long-dead winter-beast.
“Who are you, what are you, fairy-child,
That you make your toilette free!
Swiftly she smiled, as she turned to go,
“I am Youth in Love,” cried she.
“The earth is mine, and the sea and sky
And the skies beyond the sea,
Flowers and starlight, dawn and cloud —
They have all been made for me.
“I am the Flame that a thousand floods
Never can capture or bind;
I am the song of the morning star
Sung to the flute of the wind.
“Death shall fall on his sickle’s edge, and
The seed of the sorrow-tree
Shall rot unscattered when I shall meet
My lover who waits for me.”
I tried to turn from those soft, mad eyes,
That blasphemous, golden song;
I tried to chant a rebuking hymn
In rhythms of right and wrong.
But blame ran clear of that boundless smilf
That magically guiltless air;
And all my hymn as she left me was:
“Oh ! grant that he’ll find her fair.”
VICTORIA.
GEORGIA GIVERS.
The Dark Bird.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘‘That fella Cafferty got a truck,” he said,
pursuing his own line of thought. “I could
bring him here—two-—t’ree days.”
“And I’m to stick here till then?” grunted
Bradley.
“More better you wait,” said Johnny
impassively.
It was the only thing to be done, and
Bradley knew it. He was merely bluffing
himself when he imagined he could do the
eighty miles in the saddle with his injured
leg, even if Johnny were willing to walk.
And Johnny was not willing. That was
obvious from the dull, mulish look in his
eyes and the sulky droop of his jaw. Some-
thing had snapped in him, as Bradley had
always known it would snap if bad luck
dogged them any further.
“All right,” he said, with all the cheerful-
ness he could muster; “I'm the Jonah this
trip. You take the horse and push on.
And tell Cafferty lie’s on forty quid if he
can get me into the township within three
days. .. . Hdw much water can you leave
me?”
There was only a quart between them, but
Johnny was willing to leave it all. In
his excitement at the thought of pushing on,
he was quite sure he could find water for him-
self by the track. He chattered away as he
made Bradley comfortable, and the moroseness
that had settled on him for the past few
days disappeared like dew in the morning
sun Wasn’t there something sinister in
the fellow’s eagerness'to get away? Hadn’t
the heart of a chicken when it came to a
crisis !. . . . Why hadn’t he taken a white man
THIS is the dead finish,” said Bradley,
as he sat among the spinifex and
shingle, looking at his broken leg.
But then he had said the same thing
before in much the same tone. Once when
the last two packliorses had got away from
them, and once when they had found only a
dark scum and a couple of dead turkeys in
the Collabri soak after painfully making
their way back to it. They had stayed out
too long in the dry belt —that was the truth
of the matter. When he was on metal Brad-
ley could never leave it till he had explored
the ground thoroughly, and this time he had
made sure of his find; but the specimens in
liis saddle-bag did very little to lighten his
mind now.
The injured horse was threshing the
ground feebly ten yards away, trying to rise
to its feet.
“Shoot that poor brute,” Bradley told the
half-caste. “It’s no use to us now except
for meat, and I hope to God we don t have
to come to that. I’d swap the whole carcase,
anyhow, for another quart of water.
When the shot rang out he began to take
stock of the situation. It was fifty miles
across country to Jensen’s cobalt show, but
it would be little use getting there. Jensen
hadn’t even a dray; besides, he had probably
made back because of the dry spell. L
would be safer to push, on over the eighty
miles to the township, if only he could sit m
the saddle. And Johnny could walk, helping
him on and off.
But the thought of that journey over the
spinifex and shingle, with the one horse
between them, gave him a sick feeling.
throbbing in his leg, which they had managed
to set roughly, made him want to lie still.
“Well, what d’you think of it. Johnny?”
He asked the half-caste, “Bad, eli?”
The half-caste squatted beside him and
looked vaguely at the sun, which was drop-
ping toward the bare, metallic ridges. \\ hat
he thought was quite evident. After all, it
was Bradley who had crippled himself and
killed his horse, not lie. And it was Brad-
ley who persuaded him to wait out so mug,
when every instinct told him he ought to be
getting back.
THEY'LL EVEN PAINT PICKSHERS.
DAD: “’Struth, Dave! Some blokes’ll do anything so’s they won’t haveter work!”
with him for a mate? Doherty would have
snapped at the chance to come out with him
on half-shares.
“Send that brumby of yours along as fast
as it’ll • travel,” Bradley said on parting.
“And don’t forget you’re on something good
as well as Cafferty.”
Almost before lie knew it Johnny was a
speck on the edge of the tawny plain, and
there was a sense of emptiness'around lum,
a silence he could almost feel in his bones.
The swollen red ball of the sun seemed to
burst gently on the rim of the metallic ridge,
and spill its liquid light over the stony
earth. Along the line of the dried-up
watercourse stunted river-gums rose up
stifflv, their boles white as chalk and then-
foliage a yellow amber. The round balls ot
the spinifex looked like porcupines, eacli
separate and detached.
Bradley was unpleasantly conscious of the
dead horse, ten yards away from him.
There was something aggressive in the way
its lean neclc was stretched out along the
ground and its lips thrust back from its
bared teeth. It had always been a cranky
brute, and he had a feeling it was sheer vin-
dictiveness that had made it stumble on the
top of the rocky bank and crash over.
“Well, it’s dead, and I’m still alive, he
told himself with a queer chuckle, “so we’re
quits, anyway.’’ ~,
Then he settled himself against the saddle
and made himself comfortable for the night.
Between dozing and waking he assured
himself that if he got out of this venture
safely he would leave the spinifex behind
him for ever. No tomfoolery this time ! _ He
had always burnt his money too quickly
when he made a strike, so that at fifty he
was still battling. There were the thousands
he had made out of his wolfram show on the
Westralian border—where were they now?
After those years of plugging across the
desert behind the camel-teams he had been
ripe for a spree, and he had had a good one.
Bangkok, Singapore and the treaty ports of
China! Dim visions floated across his
mind of those few vivid months. He had not
been drunk all the time—-he had brought
back a load of memories, if nothing else.
One of a train going across Java —swampy
widths of rice, water-buffaloes, men and
women bathing in brown, sluggish rivers.
But he would get something more than
memories out of his strike this time.
The sun was hot on his face when he
awoke, and the ants had begun to gather
round the brownie Johnny had left beside
him. They were fiery red ants that had
an acrid smell when lie crushed them with his
hand. He shifted his position slightly, but
lie could not move far, for liis leg was a
heavy weight to drag after him. Since they
had set it in rough splints he had hardly
been conscious of it at all, but now a dull
fire began to burn around the broken bone.
It brought a dry feeling to liis throat, but
he was determined to hoard his little store
of water. ~ , .
“Got a long way to go yet, lie told him-
self. “A damn long way even if Johnny
turns up all right.”
It was then he saw the dark specks in the
sky that always filled him with loathing.
Crows! They were making with sure
instinct for the dead horse. A little latei
lie was aware of them gathering around
warily, their harsh caws filling the still
air, and their wings seeming to darken the
sky. One setttled on the dead horse s rump
and then flutterd away; another took up its
perch on a dry gum in the bed of the water-
course, the whites of its eyes showing as it
cocked its head. Bradley collected a little
heap of stones to throw at them, muttering
weird, fantastic curses to himself the while.
“That’s mad,” he told himself. “Take a
pull on yourself, Bob. They don’t know
what you’re calling them.... But why
shouldn’t they, after all? They’re devils,
not birds.”
There was something almost human about
the cheekiness of one that kept flying down
to settle on the horse’s head, dapping its
wings for a moment and then flying away.
Curiously enough it reminded Bradley of the
half-caste. Why had he let the half-caste
go off after Cafferty? He had given him a
hiding ten days before for letting the pack-
horses go unhobbled, and Johnny was the
sort of half-caste that never forgot anything.
T-Ie had a shrewd head on him, too, and knew
the value of the outcrops of ore they had
discovered. Why shouldn’t he lie low for
awhile, and then make a bargain with one
of the other prospectors?
Bradley’s suspicion of Johnny grew like
a rank fungus all the long afternoon while
lie watched the crows round the dead horse.
It fastened on him with certainty during the
night, and made him feel -tentatively for
the little bottle of capsules he had always
carried in a pocket of his undershirt since
the days he had done a perish on the Ord
River. There were some things a man could
not endure twice! He fell into a doze just
before daylight, and when lie woke the ants
were swarming round the remains of the
brownie, and the horse was staring at him
through a pair of empty sockets. The dark
birds gathering round were cheekier now.
“You’ve got to get away from here,” he
said to himself late that day. “That bit of
a ridge half-a-mile away—you could make
it if you tried.”
The ridge was a hump of metallic rock
rising from the spinifex plain like a whale’s
back from the sea. Once there, Bradley
knew he could command an outlook for
nearly twenty miles, and get a glimpse of
Calferty’s truck an hour before it arrived.
It was sheer force of will that carried
him the first hundred yards, for the broken
stones cut his knees and the sharp spikes
of the spinifex tore at his flesh. After-
wards, for he knew not how long, he
crawled spasmodically as though in a
dream, urged on by the feeling that the
crows were following him, and that it was
from them he must escape.
Gone was the illusion that Cafferty would
come for him! Gone —quite gone now ! It
was the crows his mind was fixed on, and all
liis remaining strength was put forth in the
effort to beat them. He had spilt the last
drops of his water, and he threw the empty
bag away. Impulsively he was beginning
to tear off his shirt when he remembered
the capsules near his skin. No, he musn’t
lose them! They were his talisman against
the crows.
Half-way up the ridge he lay back
exhausted, the plain beneath swimming under
liis gaze like a turbulent sea. He had
cheated those black devils —for awhile, any-
way—though their cawing was still in his
ears.
And then, far away in the sky, he became
conscious of one of them, bigger than. all
the rest. It grew even while he watched it —
grew and grew....
An obscure terror began to shake him,
blotting out his reason, paralysing his will.
The dark bird was making directly for
him, with monstrous wings outstretched, and
a triumphant cawing.
Bradley plucked at the inside of his
shirt, the veins standing out on his temples.
Fear had taken possession of him now, an
overwhelming fear that submerged his flicker-
ing love of life. This leviathan among crows
—he had seen it in his troubled dreams!
And he remembered the eyeless sockets that
had stared at him when he woke.
Something was drumming in his ears; it
was almost as if his heart was pounding
there. His eyes were misty and bloodshot,
but he could see the dark bird in the skies,
swelling ominously as he watched it.
Claws that would meet in his flesh, and a
dripping beak that would tear and rend!
With a convulsive effort he swallowed a
couple of capsules and fell back, shutting
his lids down tight so that they should blot
out the terror that was coming 0n....
And still it came on, swooping around
as if looking for a place to alight. Its wings
were spread out stiffly, and its eyes seemed
to be searching the ground.
On a smooth strip of plain, hidden from
the twitching man on the ridge, it came
finally to earth, and the pilot, a quick-eyed
young man, turned to the half-caste in the
cockpit.
“Now scout around, Johnny,” he said.
“No time to lose ! If this is the place where
you left him he can’t have gone far. I’ve
got to start out on my mail-run in a couple
of hours’ time.”
But the man on the ridge had started out
ou another journey before they found him,
lying with his face to the ground so that
liis eyes should be hidden from the dark bird.

Digging.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MEN digging: men with picks and men
with shovel and spade,
Forcing roads through the jungle, planting
the seeds of a town,
Learning in thirst and hunger the way that
a home is made;
Old men bowed and weary, young men
lithe and brown.
Men digging out in the desert for water they
cannot find;
Men digging for gold in the ranges, men
digging for coal in the mine;
Men “digging-in” in the trenches, stung with
lyddite, and blind
With blood running down to their eyepits,
penned in the mud like swine!
Men digging in convict gangs, foul and
broken, and cold
To the shame of the clanking irons. Men
at the evening hour
Digging in quiet garden, breaking the whole-
some mould
With a vision of great trees rising, or the
fragrant birth of a fiower.
Men digging in the Valley of Kings, amongst
the rubble and stone,
Finding a Pharaoh’s death-mask or the
armlet of a queen ;
Men digging for ivory-turtle’s eggs on a
northern beach and lone ;
Men digging in graves of memory for a
treasure that might have been.
Men digging for early Saxon coins in the
barrows of British dead;
Men digging the routes of railways (white
tents on a wattled lea) ;
Men digging by shell-raked hillsides, with a
blue sky overhead;
The lowly beds of their cobbers on the
shores at Gallipoli.
Men delving by Grecian ruins, soaked in
lonian sun,
With libations spilled on a seedling that
will wax to a burdened vine
Where a flame-locked Bacchus has wandered
with his leopards sleek and dun—-
This is the earthly goblet that is meet for
the godlike wine!
Wide-liatted coolies digging by the paddy
fields at dawn,
When over the bronze roofs curls the mist
like the finger of a ghost,
And the snakes of light in the water are the
young that the dark hours spawn.
While the dreams he digs from the lilies
are the things that lie prizes most.
Blue-eyed children digging on the wet and
shining sands,
Building sturdy castles that the tide will
sweep away,
And a white-faced woman watching, with
empty, restless hands.
Digging a Spanish castle from the shat-
tered shards of day.
Scholars digging in calf-bound hooks, spotted
with tears of Time,
Making a pick and shovel of the brains
that Nature gave.
Scooping a key to knowledge from a tangled
shred of rhyme—
Oh, these be the lucky diggers at the door
of Aladdin’s cave!
Men digging amongst the oat-grass where
the acres of wheat shall rise;
Men going hack to the land again, and
seeing God in the blade;
Men with eyes on the turning sod that yet
remember the skies —
Man, the eternal digger, for whom the
earth was made!
Men digging for truth, to find it in the daily
task well done;
Men saving a world in the trenches; men
saving themselves by the soil;
Men digging a path to glory that leads to
the rising sun ;
Men shaping those splendid highways that
are only made by toil!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Dan Kelly, Brother of Ned.
A PLAY IN ONE ACT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Going home in the dusk from the township
We passed an old man with his dog.
"Good evening,” said we, and “Good evening,” said
he,
Then turned down a track by a log.
And somebody said, “Well, who’d think it?”
And “What would you think then?” I said.
“Why, that man going home with his dog,
Going down on the track by the log,
He’s no one but Kelly, the Kell}’’,
Dan Kelly, the brother of Ned!”
-— “N.Q.” in The Bulletin.
Scene : The men’s quarters on a sheep-
station in New South Wales. A slab walled
room: On the right the open fireplace with
fire burning low. Suspended oner the fire a
blackened kerosene-tin with the brew of tea,
kept hot as a standing refreshment. On
the far sidle of the fire, a seat, drawn up
angle-wise to it. In the centre a solid,
plain wooden table with tin dishes contain-
ing, one a cold joint, another bread and a
third sugar. To the left {rear) shelves with
dishes and some of the Cook’s equipment.
Another small table with two seats forward
on the left. All the furniture of the room
is of the home-made bush pattern. The
entrance door from outside is in the left
upper corner. Another door to the sleep-
ing quarters is on the right.
The time is evening. The Cook, at the
left end of the big table, with a steaming
dish before him, is washing up after supper.
Joe, a, young station-hand, is sitting at the
same table reading a newspaper. Hounds of
a. distant concertina are heard, occasionally.
.Toe : How about a game o’ draughts, Dave ?
Cook : You stick t’ this game of dryin’ off,
young feller, for a bit. W’at’s it like
outside, Dave?
Dave: Might rain before long. We’ll get it
fer the muster to-morra, sure as eggs. If
it starts to-night I expect it’ll bring in
that old sundowner who’s camped on the
creek. Has ’e been in fer rations?
Cook : Not yet, but don't fret. He’ll leave
’is card on me before ’e goes. Boss says
we’ve got to go easy on rations. Too
many of these blokes on the tramp. “Give
’em a feed an’ pass ’em on,” ’e says. My
sentiments, too.
Dave : Well, I'd probably agree if I was
cook.
Joe : He’s a rum old battler. 1 heard ’im
mutterin’ an’ talkin’ to ’imself, so I went
along to take stock of ’im, but as soon as
I began arskin’ ’im questions ’e shut up
tight.
Dave: What did you say to ’im?
Joe : I arst ’im where ’e come from and
he jus’ pointed to the sunset over ’is
shoulder —like that. Then I arst ’im who
’e was.
Dave : And I’ll bet he told you 'e was Dan
Kelly.
The outer door opens and the Swagman
enters, a quaint old man with white hair
and beard and a figure bent with age and
much walking and swag-carrying. Ills
clothing is the usual weather-beaten outfit
and his old felt hat has a border of strings
with pieces of cork dangling round the rim
-—his “fly net.” He carries his rolled
blanket with billycan and pannikin attached
round his shoulder. He is evidently in the
habit of wearing his “fly net ” at all hours
regardless of day or night, but he puts up
the front of it as he addresses the Cook.
No one takes any particular notice of him
and he goes straight to the Cook, as the man
in authority.
WHEN OTHER LIPS!
MAIDEN AUNT: “Shocking exhibition! Oh — h — h, shocking!!”
GAY NIECE: “Yes, Auntie. Why, I could do better than that when I was twelve!”
Swagman : G’ day.
Cook : G’ day.
There is no cordiality on either side so
far and no sort of encouragement, or offer
of hospitality, to the stranger. The Cook
and Joe continue their washing and Dave
reads his paper. The Swagman dumps his
burden deliberately.
Swagman: You’re cook, ain’t ye?
Cook : Oh no, I only do this as a ’obby,
jus’ to learn the fine art o’ liousekeepin’,
like they teach the kids in the schools now.
But his satire is lost on the Swagman, who
turns to Dave.
Swagman : He’s cook, ain’t ’e?
Dave: Well, it ain’t always We
generally calls ’im the “poisoner. but
you better be careful how you talk that
way.
Swag (turning to the Cook) : I knew ye
was. I know a cook when I see one.
Cook: Well, you ought to by now, I sh’d
judge. What can I do for y’, Mister
? I didn’t catch yer name.
Swag : Ye can give me a camp an’ a bunk
fer to-night, anyway.
Cook : Any other order, Mr.—er —Kelly ?
Swag : Ain’t my orders. I saw. yer boss
this afternoon an’ ’e told me if it come
on to rain I could come and camp ’ere.
That’s orders enough, ain’t it?
Cook: I don’t notice that it’s started rain-
in’. yet—anything worth speakin’ of.
Swag: Didn’ expec’ me to wait*an come m
swimmin’, did ye?
Cook : All same to me if y’ swim or come m
yer whaleboat. I’ve got you on me ands
anyway, so welcome to Bucken am Palace
(waring a hand round . the room). Had
anything t’ eat? You re a bit late.
(He points a hand of invitation at the
food on the table.) .
Swag (with friendly alacrity) : That’s the
word, Cookie. I c’d do with a bite. Get
on with yer work. I know me way about.
He takes his swag to the fireside and
dumps it there, detaches a pannikin, dips a
fill of tea from the receptacle over the fire
and returns to the table.
Cook: Want any tools?
He picks up a knife and, fork.
Swag: Well, I’ll just ’ave a -plate for style.
Don’t want any knife an’ fork, unless yer
mutton’s OS tmudi as old Hungrvgut’s

He cuts himself a slice from the joint and
then a hunk of bread and sits on the form
by the fire eating Ms
food awkwardly with m old-f shioned clasp
knife taken from his belt,
silence for a few moments Cook and Joe
finish then drying opeiati nr. ?
Joe i ( OITIO on, Dave, let >s liave tliat o
Dave: Well, you set the board out.
Joe goes to the smaller table and docs so.
Cook : 1 expec’ you fellers ’ll be out all day
to-morra fer th’ muster—daylight start.
Aleans I’ll ’ave t’ be up in tli’ dark cuttin’
up tucker fer y’ and fillin’ y’r billies.
Dave : Well, if 1 got *t’ be up at daylight I
ain’t goin’ t’ sit up playin’ draughts.
Joe (petulantly pushing the board aside):
Oh cripes! 'it's always like that, jus’
w’en I thought of a move w’ere I c’d beat
y’ on that double-corner move o’ yours.
Dave: Well, don’t ’ave it on yer mind to-
morra, Joey, or you’ll be missin’ a few
sheep in tli’ single corners of the paddick.
an’ that won’t be healthy w’en the boss
finds ’em.
The Swag pauses in his gustatory work
and addresses the Cook.
Swag : Not a bad bit of meat that, Cook.
Best I’ve ’ad for a good while —or else
it’s the way you cook it.
Cook : Ar! Now yer gettin’ quite polite,
eh?
Swag (good-humoredly) : Always be civil
t’ the cook, that’s my motter —the only
one I got. Pretty good bread, too. You’re
a class baker as well. I c’d do with a
bit o’ that an’ the meat —on the road to-
morra.
Cook : Ar!
Swag : An’ a handful o’ tea an’ sugar.
Cook : Ar!
Swag : An’ enough flour fer a damper w’en
y’r bread’s done.
Cook : Look’s as if I was goin’ t’ be busy in
the mornin’.
Dave (to the Swag) : Come far to-day,
Dan ?
Swag (suspecting another satirist ) : Up
from the bank of the crik alongside.
Ife points over his shoulder.
Dave : Ar! Quite a long walk.
Swag: I’ve done all the walkin’ I want
t’ do in me time, and I got plenty in
front o’ me.
Dave: All the way down the rivers from
’ere t’ Adelaide, I expec’?
Savag: An’ back agin—more’n once.
Cook : You oughter write one o’ them guide-
books for travellers.
Joe: He does ’em on the station gateposts.
The Swagman disdains to notice and con-
tinues drinking his tea.
Dave: You’re gettin’ too old for that game.
Why not take the old-age pension and a
rest ?
Swag ( angrily ) : Damn yer old-age pen-
sions! I put in fer one an’ 'ow did they
treat me? Arsks me t’ prove who I was,
where I was born an’ w’at I been doin
all me life. Wants references t’ character
—jus’ as if I was askin’ fer work.
Cook : Fair insult that.
Swag : But I don’t want yer pensions. I’m
independent—independent—understand ? I
don’t want no favors. (He pauses again
and makes significant demonstration with
the empty pipe and patting of his pockets.)
Anyone got a bit o’ terbacker t’ spare?
Dave passes him a plug and he cuts off
a piece with , the clasp-knife. He does not
cut it up, hut retires again to his seat ,
mumbling. He carefully transfers the hit of
tobacco to his pocket and helps himself to
more tea.
Marsh, the station-owner, enters from
outside. He is an elderly man with a short
grey heard. He limps slightly on one
leg and, as is common in such cases, more
pronouncedly after sitting in one position
for some time.
Cook : Evenin’, Mr. Marsh.
Marsh (giving a nod in acknowledgment) :
1 just came in to remind you chaps that
we start the muster first thing to-morrow.
Looks like a change of weather coming,
and my barometer (rubbing his knee)
tells me rain is about. Beats all the
official forecasters hollow. Perhaps to-
night., but sometime to-morrow —you’ll
see. By the way, did that old sundowner
come in? (The Cook points to the fire-
side. ) Ah, there he is! I told him to
come in if it started to rain.
Cook : He’s beaten the rain by a few hours,
or else ’e forecasted it cornin’ a bit earlier
than you do.
Marsh: Never mind. Give him a bunk.
I suppose he’s had a feed?
Cook (nodding assent ) : We’ve caught a
real old hatter this time, I
think, Mr. Marsh.
The Swagman is still mutter-
ing to himself.
’Marsh : Ah ! What’s he mumb-
ling to himself about?
Joe : Got a touch o’ Darling pea,
I think.
Dave : Fancies ’e’s Dan Kelly.
Mars h ( uncomprehending ) :
Dan who?
Dave : Dan Kelly, the brother of
Ned. You know the old super-
stition of these travellers, Mr.
Marsh? Dan Kelly, according
t’ them, escaped from the
burning hotel at Glenrowan
and is supposed to be wan-
derin’ about the bush ever
since. Every other old hat-
ter’s got the delusion that ’e’s
the real Dan Kelly. The busli
tracks are full of ’em. I've
met about a dozen of ’em.
Swag ( morosely and looking up
suddenly) : I ain’t Dan Kelly.
Davs ( pacifically ) : Never mind,
Dan. No offence meant. You
can be whoever y’ like.
Swag: Well, I ain’t Dan Kelly.
•Joe: Then if it comes to that.
who might you be?
Swag : I might be Gawd
A’mighty, or Judas Iscariot,
but I ain’t either of ’em.
You’re as bad as them old-age
pension pepole. Want t’ know
everything.
Dave ( soothingly ) : Never mind,
Dan. Be as mysterious as y’
like. It’s your affair an’ not
ours.
Swag: There ain’t any myst’ries
these days. What you call
myst’ries is only to frighten
kids with.
Joe: Then you know a real one?
Mixed up in it yourself, per-
’aps?
Swag: Ar! I c’d tell y’ things
as ’d surprise ye.
He stops to enjoy the sensa-
tion of arresting all attention.
Joe: Well, give us a sample.
Swag : And have a pup like you
callin’ me a liar?
Dave: Don’t take any notice of
’im. We'll keep ’im civil to y’.
The Swagman seems appeased ,
hut waits a little longer as if in
douht, or in order to whet
curiosity.
Swag: Did ye ever ear o the
mystery o’ Blackduck Bend .
No one answers for the
moment. Marsh comes closer, his interest
fIVOH, 9 C(I
Joe (irrelevantly) : Blackduck Bend?
Where’s that? Down the creek somewhere?
Dave: I think ’.e means Blackduck Bend
Station on the Warrego, in Queens.and.
Big sheep station. I shore there two years
ago. „ , .
Swag: No it ain’t. You never shore at
Blackduck. It’s cattle.
Dave (nettled) : ’Scuse me, but I did. lliey
shore forty thousand that year an 1 cut
out two thousand myself.
Swag (contemptuously) : Two thousand
bandicoots! It’s cattle I tell ye.
Dave: An’ I say it’s sheep, you old goat.
I oughta know, when I shore ’em.
Marsh (interposing) : You’re both right, if
used to be cattle. It s sheep now has
been for the last twenty years.
Swag : Ar, maybe! Times is changed. I
ain’t been there for forty-five year.
Marsh (keenly interested) : Did you say
you were on Blackduck Bend forty-five
years ago?
Swag: No. I wasn’t on the station —not
workin’ there, but I could tell ye some-
thin’ about it. But (hopelessly) what s
the use?
Dave : He’s got me beat. Forty-five years is
a lot before my time.
Marsh (to the Swag) : But what do you
know about the place? What’s the mys-
tery you’re hinting at?
The Stvag does not respond.
Dave : I remember now I heard some old
hands up there talkin’ about some sen-
sational happenin’ in the early days—a
bushranger shot, a murder, ’r something
like that.
Swag : There wasn’ no bushranger, there
wasn’ no murder, but nex’ thing to it.
(The listeners evidently consider it. policy
to let the ancient ramble on at will.)

Did ye ever ’ear o’ Jim Riley, the king
o’ the cattlemen?
Dave : Cattlemen? I know the “Cattle
King,” as they call ’im, but ’is name isn’t
Riley.
Marsh : I think he means cattle-duffers. His
way of putting it sounds more romantic.
Cattle-thieves were plentiful and often very
daring in those days. (To the Swag.)
Jim Riley, eh? (Scrutinising him closely.)
Is that who you’re supposed to be?
Swag (sulkily) : I ain't supposin’ anythin’.
I’m tellin’ ye.
Marsh: But, unfortunately for your story,
Riley was killed there—caught red-handed
and shot—so they used to say.
Swag : Shot but not killed. Tha’s w’ere
they're all wrong. .
Marsh (with a laugh) : Oh, I see. It's
another version of the Dan Kelly legend.
You were shot but escaped to the bush and
recovered—and you’re still going strong!
Swag (angrily) : I tell ye again I ain’t Dan
Kelly.
Dave (always the pacifist) : All right, Dan.
Joe: You’ve recovered from bein’ shot, any-
way. Sure you didn’t have to get out of
afire, too?
Swag (unappeased) : You damn young fools
think ye know everything and ye don’t
know, anything. (Sulkily.) Find out the
rest y selves and be damned t' ye!
He goes back to the fireplace to the
accompaniment of muttered “ Damn fools,”
“ I’m a liar, o’ course,” etc.
Marsh (rising) : Don’t bait him, boys. Let
him have his own way. It’s a harmless
enough delusion. Now, you’d better go to
bed so as to be out at daylight to-morrow.
I’ll look after this old fellow. I'll stay
and have a smoke with him.
The Cook, Dave and Joe go out with an
exchange of “Good nights” with their boss.
Marsh pulls a seat over near the Swagman,
takes out and lights his pipe. The Swagman,
observing, takes out his oion pipe and does
through the ritual of examining the empty
bowl and searching his pockets. Marsh
passes him a plug. The Swagman cuts off a
piece and proceeds to cut it up, using his
clasp-knife awkwardly, Marsh not observing
him for the time.
,
Marsh . So you re Jim Kiley, the cattle-
duffer, eh? Well, well! What put that
idea into your head? Never mind. I sup-
pose it’s as good a yarn as the Dan Kelly
one —•—• (He stops abruptly, his eyes
riveted' to the old man’s tobacco-cutting
opei’ation.) Where did you get that knife?
Swag: That knife? It’s an ol’ friend—best.
friend I ever ’ad, though I can’t use it
properly now. Ye see my hand won’t
(He makes a feeble flourish with it,' when
Marsh quickly grabs him by the wrist.)
Marsh : Drop it!
Swag (in astonishment as he lets the knife
drop) : Hey, what’s the matter, Mister?
Marsh (still holding his wrist) : Nothing,
nothing. I didn’t like the way you were
flourishing that knife. ( Scrutinising the
Swag’s open palm.) How did you get that
wound in your hand? (Looking at his
neck.) You've got another scar there, too.
That’s odd ! That’s odd!
Swag : Same shot, Mister. Through me hand,
an’ into me neck. That’s what laid me
out for dead an’ accounted fer the rumor
that I was killed. But I wasn’t, ye see.
Damn near thing, though. (He chuckles
LEFT TO THE CURATE.
HOSTESS (to Curate at the children’s party) : Shall you give them your song now, Mr.
Meekin, or shall we allow them to enjoy themselves for another half-hour?”
satanically, then suddenly) How’d you
come to know anything about it?
Marsh (casually): Oh, I often heard it
talked about—old-time sensation—mysteri-
ous affair altogether. I’m old enough to
remember the case. _ I was one of those
who thought Jim Riley had been killed.
But please tell the story in your own way.
The Swagman is in no hurry , however.
lie loads his pipe, takes out a, matchbox and
shakes it at his ear. Marsh accepts the hint
and passes his own box. The Swagman
lights up, transfers matches from the box to
his own and hands back the borrowed box.
Marsh : Well?
Hut the Swagman. like most storytellers.
likes to hear first the other man’s account and
correct him authoritatively.
Swag : W’at was the version of it you ’eard?
Marsh; Something like this, as well as I re-
member. Jim Riley or you (if it was you)
had rounded up some station cattle in the
scrub and was busy cutting out the ear-
marks.
Swag (enjoying the celebrity) : An’ that’s
the very knife as I was doin’ it with.
p ve stuck to it ever since.
Marsh: Ah!—and a young station over-
seer surprised yon. I forget his name,
it doesn’t matter.
Swag: Bertram. I won’t forget it in a
hurry. (Gesticulating with the knife in
a sudden burst of passion.) Only let me
set eyes on ’im again, an’ by God!
(Arresting himself.) Go on! Go on!
Marsh: Er—no one knows exactly what
happened.
Swag ( excitedly ) : I can tell ye. That
young fool rides up and challenges me
with a revolver, just ’s if I was a bush-
ranger. Calls on me to surrender. He
was mounted an’ I wasn’t, but I pulls
’im off the saddle an’ we closes and grap-
pies oil the ground. I ’ad this knife in
me hand an’ I let out an’ landed ’im a
stab in the thigh.
Marsh; In the knee it was, a much worse
place.
Swag: No, Mister, in the thigh, just ’ere
(indicating the spot on his own leg). He
shoved ’is revolver in my face. I put me
hand in front of it an’ ’e fired point blank,
I.didn’ remember any more till I come to
j n the ’ospital a hundred mile away. But
it wasn’t me brave overseer what brought
me in.
Marsh: I suppose someone found you where
you fell.
Swag : Yes, lucky fer me. Pretty near
bled t’ death, I was.
Marsh : What became of the young over
seer?
Swag: Tha’s part o the mystjery. He
disappeared—never seen again—in them
m, yway. , suppose e thought e d
knled me an made a bolt.
Marsh: Make allowances tor him. He was
Umug and inexperienced and, I suppose,
panic-stricken. ,
b ' VAG : j don l blame im. I d ha done the
same in is place. It must ve looked Hike
murder. 1 erhaps lie got away into the
scrub an died of the wounds I give im,
though it ain’t very likely. Nobody
knows. I’ve never seen ’im since, though
j been lookin’ for ’im all the time—-off
au > on.
Marsh: 'Well, you were taken to the hos-
pital. Wliat then?
Swag : 1 got better by degrees, but I heard
they had a warrant waitin’ fer me soon
as I was well enough, so I shammed a hit
worse than I was till I felt fit enough to
leave, then one night I slipped out of the
’ospital and got well away over the
border (pause), an’ I seem to ’a've been
goin’ ever since. They never caught me
an’ they never caught that overseer
neither. I don’t believe they ever really
tried for either of us.
Marsh: What makes you think that?
Swag: Why, don’t ye see? They ’ad no case
against me without that overseer fer a
witness, and he’d bolted, an’ as fer ’im.
they didn’ want t’ find ’iin—though I
daresay ’e didn’ know that.
Marsh : Did you ever hear what became of
him?
Swag: No, Mister ( venomously ). If ’e’s
alive I hope to find ’im some day. If V.
died in the scrub the crows picked ’is
bones clean. Good enough for ’im if they
did. Good enough by all that’s holy!
Marsh : I understand he got away safely.
It looked to him like a murder or man-
slaughter case. He never knew but what
it was, so he changed his name and made
a fresh start a long way off—did well, I’m
told. He always thought he had killed
Jim Riley—never knew better till —till
long afterwards. But that stab of yours
handicapped him. That wound in the knee
with your knife.
Swag (correcting) : Not in the knee. In
the thigh—just ’ere.
Marsh (with a gesture of helplessness) :
Well, it handicapped him a lot. Stopped
him from mounting a horse on the near
side, for one thing, and caused lots of
inconveniences like that.
Swag (as before) : Good enough fer the
cow! Look at that hand. Every time I
try to cut terbacker or close it on anythin’
au’ can’t do it I think of the time, when I
can drive this knife into his carcase.
(Gesticulating with it.)
Marsh (grabbing his arm) : Look out what
you’re doing with that knife! (Fcremp-
torily) Put it down or I’ll take it away
from you. (The Swagman reluctantly
returns it to his belt.) It’s time you for-
MIXED FARMING.
“It’s a wondex you don’t get rid of your bull-cow, sir, and, go in for another of these
pullets.”
gave him for tin'", lie was only trying to
do what he thought was his duty.
Swag : Duty! Shootin’ me like a dog!
What ’arm ’ad I done? What was a few
calves to the big station? They’d never
ha’ missed ’em. And up comes that damned
young fool, flourishin’ his revolver with
“Surrender! I arrest you!”
Marsh : Single-handed and without a war-
rant.... That was foolish, I admit. You see
cattle-stealing seemed a serious thing to
the owners. You thought lightly of it.
That 'young overseer didn’t. But it made
him .more prudent for the future, and I
daresay it reformed you, too.
But the Swagman disclaims a virtue, just
as he objects to the imputation of dis-
honesty.'
Swag : No, it didn’t. You don’t give up the
game as easy as all that. Once a cattle-
duffer is like bein’ once a priest. I got
in with another gang down south later
on. They nabbed me an’ landed me in
quod for that, but they didn’ know any-
thing about that Blackduck Bend busi-
ness, so I got off fairly light as a first
offender. First offender! (He chuckles
■ over the irony of it. ) Me, the king of
the Warrego cattlemen !
Marsh : Well, the overseer of Blackduck
wasn’t responsible for that.
Swag : I ain’t so sure. He drove me there
w’ere I struck trouble. (Implacably)
But it don’t matter. (Holding up his
hand) He’s responsible fer that an’ I’ve
got to get even if it takes all the life I
got left. But I s’pose it’s no good. (His
tone fades into hopelessness.) I’m an
old man. I’m getting’ feebler and can't
see as well as I useter. I doubt if I’d
know Jim if I saw ’im after all these
years. (A pause) I expect I’ve changed
a bit meself if it comes to that.
Marsh : You —you probably have.
Swag: I got to go on me own, too. It’s
no good askin’ people questions. _ They
jus’ laugh, good-natured like, an’ give
-foolish answers. All they say is, “Poor
old hatter! Thinks lie’s Dan Kelly, the
bushranger. Give ’im a feed, humor ’im
an’ pass ’im on.” (A pause) An’ they
don’t always gimme the feed either. So
I. just got to go on walkin’ about the
country, lookin’ on me own.
Marsh : Good God ! To think of it! You

quite needlessly, as it happened ; you nurs-
ing your vengeance against him every
time you try to use your right hand and
he cursing you whenever he tries to mount
a horse. The wasted years ! The folly !
The irony of it!
Swag (unmoved) : He ’ad the best of it.
Marsh : The best! Thinking for years that
he carried the responsibility for murder,
or at best a foolish homicide.
Swag : More fool him.
Marsh (very earnestly) : Perhaps, but
that’s not a fair way to look at it. Why
should you waste what’s left of your life
in a foolish pursuit of revenge that you’re
never likely to get—which would be no
satisfaction to you if you did get it. Why,
I’ll wager that that overseer—if —if he
knew that you were still alive, would be
glad of it
Swag (with a sinister grin) : So would I,
Mister, if I only knew where to find ’im.
Marsh : Oh no, no! That’s not my mean-
ing. You know better than that. Get
rid of that stupid grievance that’s nearly
as old as yourself. If you did find him,
it’s odds on that lie would be really glad—
ready to shake hands with you in token
of forgetfulness of wrongs. Why can’t you
show that spirit? Come! Be a sports-
man. Give me your hand on it and say
that you forgive him.
He extends a hand frankly to the Swag-
man, but the latter only holds up his own.
Swag : Ye mean ivell, Mister. Ye mean
kindly, I know, but that hand’s no good
now fer shakin’ hands with. (Shaking
Ibis head) I been thinkin’ over it too long
an’ it’s too late t’ change me ways now.
Besides (with a wicked chuckle), ’e’s ’ad
the satisfaction o’ thinkin’ me dead an’
I only got the satisfaction of lookin’ fer
’im. An’ Buckley’s chance o’ lindin’ 'im,
it seems. (A pause) An’, after all. ’e
did come off best, lie damn near killed
me, an’ it was nothing, after all —that
stab I give ’im in the thigh.
Marsh ( jumpin'j up irritably and rubbing
his knee ruefully) : Damn your obstinacy!
It was in the knee. (But the Swagman,
shaking his head and muttering “Lies!
Lies! Everythin’ I say’s lies.” “Old hatter
with Darling pea” and so on, is paying no
attention. Marsh limps to the door R. and
calls.) Dave! Come here. (Dave enters.)
Look after this old fellow. Find a bunk for
him and tell the Cook to start him on the
road to-morrow with a good ration of
meat, tea and flour and any other thing
he wants. He isn’t Dan Kelly, after all.
but— —
Hie touches his head significantly and
Dave smiles with understanding. The Swag-
man has become suddenly alert again icith
the instructions for his benefit.
Swag : That’s the way to talk, Mister. Hold
on till I get me bedroom furniture. (He
picks up his swag.) Much obliged t’ ye,
Mister. You’re real kind to a traveller —
kinder than most of ’em, by a damn sight.
I don’t bear you any grudge, anyway.
Good luck t’ ye, an’ good night.
He starts to follow Dave out.
Marsh: Good night (rubbing his knee
again). Get to work at daylight to-morrow
Dave. It’s going to rain like blazes. I’ll
finish my smoke here and put out the
light.
Dave: Very well, Mr. Marsh. Come along,
Dan.
Swag (following) : I’m cornin’, but I ain’t
really Dan Kelly, y’ know. I been tryin’
t’ explain t’ everybody
The rest is lost as he disappears through
the door. Marsh lights his pipe and sits
smoking in jwofound reflection.
(The curtain falls.)

Seven Months to Go
Within a week of the announcement of “The Bulletin’s” £1 700
Prize Novel Competition, the first bundle of MS. arrived at the
office; and since then it has been joined in the safe by a few others.
But these are works, of course, that the writers had on hand; they
rushed them along to get early in the queue for the £5OO first prize
that is to be awarded within a few weeks of the closing of the first
competition on June 30 next. There will be second and third prizes
of £l5O and £5O respectively; and a minimum of £lOOO will be
distributed in prizes during the following two years.
From what “The Bulletin” can gather, the candle or some
other light is being consumed in a hundred back-country homes m
Australia in a laudable effort to win the £5OO and all that it means
besides in the way of fame and profit; and no doubt almost every
professional and semi-professional story-writer in Australia will
“have a shot at it.” There is one thing in particular
competition which seems to be generally approved—no man’s style
(and no woman’s) is cramped. The competitor must be either
Australian-born or bona fide resident in Australia (Australia mean-
ing also Maoriland and the South Pacific), but beyond that there
are practically no limiting conditions. The story need not even be
Australian in setting, though “The Bulletin” will be horribly dis-
appointed if the competition does not produce many printable
stories with an Australian background.
The competition has attracted a great deal of attention in
England and in the U.S.A.; and in England especially the size of
the prizes has been commented upon wonderingly. Incidentally,
many complimentary things have been said about “The Bulletin”;
but that doesn’t matter. One large American firm has got in early
with an offer to publish the prize story, and it suggests terms very
alluring to the winner; but, while this is very gratifying, no arrange-
ment of the sort will be entered into beforehand. The successful
writers can make their own arrangements with both European and
American publishers; the profits on such book publication, by the
way, will belong wholly to the writers.
Naturally "The Bulletin” hopes that the competition will pro-
duce a fine crop of great stories; and, to that end, if anybody desires
any further information about the competition, “The Bulletin”
will be glad to supply it.

The money at 4 per cent. (Pass-Book Account) can be with-
drawn up to £5O daily, or the whole in a few days.
The money at 4£ per cent. (Deposit Stock) can be withdrawn
on notice up to 6 months for £lOOO.
Facilities for Tourists and Holiday Makers.
A depositor in the State Savings Bank of Victoria, before
visiting any part of Victoria or other State, may arrange with
the Branch at which his account is kept to have money available
at call at his place of destination.
By taking advantage of this concession a depositor can over-
come the difficulty of obtaining identification in the town where
payment is required to be made. The necessity for carrying about
money in excess of immediate requirements is also avoided.
There is no fee for withdrawals at towns within Victoria, but
if payment is made in another State in the Commonwealth a small
charge is made. The following Banks act as Agents for the State
Savings Bank of Victoria in other States, viz.:—
New South Wales. . The Government Savings Bank.

We and the Family.
“The Bulletin” and Its Programme.
We have been making some experiments
in The Bulletin Office this year. Four
new features were introduced. First, we
wanted to do more for the men on the land.
They are scattered over the whole country
and can’t conveniently get together to ex-
change ideas and experiences. The Bul-
letin, being the one paper which goes to all
parts of Australia, decided that it must be
the vehicle for farmers everywhere to swap
ideas. The section was started with one
foundation principle: its single object was
to make the farm pay better and thus turn
it into a more desirable place of residence
for the farmer and his family.
* * * *
The co-operation of every scientific expert
in the service of the Agricultural Depart-
ment was secured; but, above all, The
Bulletin wanted to hear from the prac-
tical man who could help his brother out of
his difficulties or assist him in improving his
harvest or his clip. The response was
splendid. In the nine months since the sec-
tion was started contributions have been
received from over 1100 wheat, wool and
fruit farmers and men engaged in connec-
tion with these industries.
If any farmer believes he has some infor-
mation which is not generally known, and
which he believes it would be a good thing
for others to know, The Bulletin’s Man
on the Land Section will welcome him
cordially. Four-fifths 'of the matter found
in the average farmer’s paper is of no
practical value. We want every line in
The Bulletin’s farm section to be a real
help. We want to make it the farmer’s
“offsider”—the best and cheapest “offsider”
he ever had.
* * * *
At the same time The Bulletin realised
that it was in a position to get information
about a thousand things which it was diffi-
cult or impossible for the individual reader
to investigate. Especially are the man and
woman in the country handicapped. They
want to know something—whether they can
do this, whether they can’t do that —but
they don’t know to whom to apply for the
information. The Bulletin doesn’t know
everything; but with its prestige it can find
ourmany things it doesn’t know. It there-
fore set up a Service Department, and,
judging by results, somebody should have
done it long ago. Apparently nothing that
The Bulletin ever did was so popular.
In one week over 1400 communications
reached the Service Department. Con-
fessedly, this involves a great amount of
work; but it is willingly done. What has
really amazed The Bulletin has been the
warmth of the co-operation of experts who
have been consulted. They have not been
content to give perfunctory answers; they
have shown a splendid desire to be of public
service. The Commonwealth Meteorologist
(Mr. Hunt) ; almost every professor of the
Sydney University, but more particularly
Professor Vonwiller (Physics) and Dr.
Woolnough (Geology) ; the heads of Gov-
ernment Departments, and more particularly
Mr. Ross (N.S.W. Under-Secretary of Agri-
culture) and his staff; the secretary of the
Sydney and Melbourne Stock Exchanges—
to those and a hundred more the Service
Department is indebted.
* * * *
And the service rendered has gone far
beyond the mere answering of questions. One
illustration will serve. A few months ago,
just as the grapes were forming in the
vineyards along the Murray valley, a wide-
spread frost occurred. It looked as though
the crop was ruined ; and very many of the
growers are ex-Diggers with very small
rpeans. That good friend of the Diggers,
Mr. F. G. White, of Broken Hill, heard at
once of the disaster, and wired to the Service
Department; could it suggest catch crops
so that these chaps might be carried over
the year? The N.S.W. Agricultural Depart-
ment was consulted, and within 48 hours
not only was an inspector on his way to
the Murray Valley, but communication had
been opened up between the departments of
the three States interested. Such prompt
action makes one realise that Government
offices are not all Red Tape.

It need hardly be said that part of the pro-
gramme for the coming year is to improve
and extend this Service Department. As
those who have made use of it are aware,
whatever it does it does without any charge
whatever.

The two other new sections introduced were
the “Smoke-oh” page of frivolity and “The
Little Sisters,” devoted to a brief survey of
events in the smaller capitals seen through
the eyes of women. They have both justified
themselves. There have been weeks, in fact,
when The Bulletin has been rather proud
of its “Smoke-oh” page ; and at this time of
day it takes a pretty good page to produce a
feeling of that sort.
* * * *
Apart from the new sections, there have
been changes—or, rather perhaps, develop-
ments. These have been most marked in con-
nection with the illustrations. The roll of
artists co-operating has been extended; and
it will be extended still further. During the
latter part of the year some remarkable deco-
rations of verse have been contributed by
Jardine, the Australian artist in New York.
One from his brush will be found in this num- <
ber. Others will be printed during the year.
B. E. Minns, the incomparable delineator of
the Australian abo., whose “Gib It a Bite” i
graces the front page of this issue, also re-
turns to Th\ Bulletin. Arrangements have
been made \ith other artists new to The
Bulletin to further strengthen this side of
the paper; mid one or two who. have
not of late been represented will rejoin the
staff of contributors during the busy year
that is ahead.
* * * *
It can therefore be safely said that The
Bulletin drawings will reach during 1928 a
general level never approached in the past;
and that is a good deal to say, remembering
that men like “Hop,” Phil May, Lindsay and
Low have been members of the staff at
different times.
* * * *
Mention of “Hop” recalls the “Hop Mem-
orial Number.” It was so great a success
that the issue of special numbers will be
considered in the future. For two there has
been a long-continued demand. One should
be published at Easter; the other in time to
catch the Christmas mails overseas. A very
well-known Australian in London writes:
“The Christmas Bulletin will not reach
me till the end of January ; and I want a
taste of Australia, such as only The Bul-
letin can give me, with my Christmas din-
ner.” We must see what we can do about it.
jjc *
But the most important development of the
year will be the arrival of the serial. Five
months ago The Bulletin announced that in
order to encourage long-story writing in Aus-
tralia and by Australians, during the next
three years it would give prizes of at least
£1700 for novels, copyright to belong abso-
lutely to the authors, but first serial rights
(for Australasia only) to attach to The
Bulletin. Naturally no announcement ever
made has attracted more attention among
writers in Australia than the offer of a £500
first-prize for novels submitted by June 30
next, with other prizes totalling £1200 ; and
this paper has good hopes of being able to say
that it has received a large number of works
well entitled to serial publication.
« * * *
The prize stories more suited for publi-
cation in the Woman’s Mirror will be
printed in that astonishingly successful paper.
That the Mirror should have achieved a cir-
culation of over 120,000 in less than three
years, and that it continues to grow, is proof
enough of the excellence of the plans on which
it was built. For the present there seems
no reason why they should be changed in
any way. The Woman’s Mirror will go on
as it has been going, improving as it grows;
in particular the offer of such substantial
prizes for novels will doubtless provide it in
the future with serials of outstanding merit.
That a paper of the quality of the Mirror
can be produced and sold for threepence is,
of course, largely due to the advertising sup-
port it has received. So great has been the
demand for space that some weeks before
Christmas it became necessary to close the
doors for a while to new applicants.
There have been, incidentally, some
developments so far as the advertiser is con-
cerned. The conclusion was come to that
the advertiser who paid large sums for
space in The Bulletin and the Woman’s
Mirror was entitled to all the publicity
the papers could possibly give him; and
with that in mind these papers proceeded
to advertise themselves widely throughout
Australia and the Pacific Islands, including
New Zealand. The Bulletin and
Woman’s Mirror are now extensively
advertised in over 100 Australian papers
alone; and their own advertisers must get
benefit from this in a wider publicity.
* * * *
The “Wild Cat” Monthly is the third of
the regular publications from The Bulle-
tin office; and of the three it has made the
greatest strides during the year. Its circu-
lation has more than trebled, and in a cam-
paign planned for the coming year it is
expected that it will be again doubled. Aus-
tralia has more investors in proportion to
population than any other country in the
world, even though the majority be investors
to the extent only of having Savings Bank
deposits. An exceptional proportion are also
insurance policy-holders. Twenty-two shil-
lings and sixpence may seem a good deal of
money to pay for a monthly magazine for
a year; but if it will keep a man from put-
ting his little all into a very doubtful life-
assurance office, and point him the way
to a sound investment, it is money very
well spent. Too often the small investor
doesn’t think it worth while to inform him-
self about financial matters, with the result
that the go-getter with the doubtful shares or
bonds or allotments to sell invariably knocks
at his door. The “Wild Cat” Monthly
is designed to protect every class of inves-
tor. It is twice as valuable as it was a
couple of years ago, and it is not half as
good now as The Bulletin wants it to be.
The coming year will see large improvements
in it—improvements which the expected
increase in circulation will greatly simplify.
# * * *
The Bulletin publications have always
got nearer to their readers than most papers
ever do. This has been largely due to the
fact that The Bulletin reader is always
invited to be a Bulletin contributor. As
J. F. Archibald used to say, every man has
one story to tell. There is something that
everybody knows better than everybody else.
The Bulletin and the Woman’s Mirror
want those stories, those special little bits of
information. Through their various depart-
ments they also want to help their readers iu
their difficulties. They want to be, and they
are, something more than vehicles for collect-
ing sixpences and threepences. They are not
humbugs: frankly they believe that this
policy will win them even larger circula-
tions than they enjoy to-day. The question
: simply is can circulation be got best by sen-
sation or by service? With a very few
exceptions the papers of Australia, daily and
weekly, are trusting to sensations —to
“stunts,” as they call it. The Bulletin
: puts its trust in service and has never had
any doubt about the result.
