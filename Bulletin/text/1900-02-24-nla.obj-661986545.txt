ANTHOLOGY —Greek, anthos, a flower;
legem, to gather wherefore Alice
Meynell calls her anthology, “The
Flower of the Mind.” If the good
lady would permit her temperament to be
seen merely in the collection—in the hues,
and scents, and arrangement ! But she will
pluck out stained petals (as she thinks)—she
will omit the verses and passages which do
not please her private taste—and so will
insist on misrepresenting the minds whose
flowers she plucks. Palgrave was as bad in
his arbitrary way—lopping and altering to
suit his early-Victorian maxims and morals.
Concede that in a “ popular ” collection you
cannot, always print the lively Elizabethans
and the loose Cavaliers as they were origi-
nally printed ; but you can at least add a
note of regret for their too-mucli, or your
too-little. And the Rev. H. C. Beeching,
whose anthology is perhaps the most satis-
factory of all, can omit half-a-dozen lines of
Marvell's “ To His Coy Mistress ” without a
hint of loss.
Professor Arber—that famous grubber
among old books and manuscripts, and re-
printer of forgotten worthies, has a greater
reverence for the written word and the
author’s privilege ; and he cuts, apparently,
as little as he can help. His ten volumes of
anthologies, of which five are already issued
by the Oxford Press, will afford presumably
the best view of English lyric poetry so-far
obtainable. He takes his authors by histori-
cal periods ; and gives you a Shakespeare
anthology, a Jonson anthology, a Dryden
anthology, and so on—getting his titles from
the leading poets of his periods. And as his
volumes are well printed and bound in cloth
for only half-a-crown each, the series can be
honestly recommended to poetry-lovers.
“The Dryden Anthology,” one of the
'-volumes latest to hand* covers the period ©f
the Restoration—the time of England’s
lyrical afterglow. The young intensity, the
magical imagination, of the mighty Eliza-
bethans were no more ; and instead of the
poetry of nature and the lover in the grove
came the poetry of artifice and the lover
at the court. There was learning, and
leisure, and the mode of France swayed all
who came within its influence. Charles Rex
led the way of easy morals, and a troop of
lyrists followed in uneasy metres—for the
French dress did not accommodate it-
self too well to the stiff angles of the
sombre English mind, joyous almost in
spite of itself. Everybody’s mistress ex-
pected a tripping measure in celebration
of her bright eyes, or white bosom ; and as
often as not she retaliated in kind. It was
a gentleman’s part to rhyme as well as he
rode ; and the graces of amorous verbiage
were cultivated almost as much as the graces
of L’Ainour herself. And withal it was a
manly age, even if the manliness was running
to seed. The stern and virile virtues had
been tried and refined in the long wars
of the Commonwealth ; and minds retained
a residue of heat to fill their fervid verses.
There was no more Shakespearean linnet-
singing by a brook, to a star ; yet the linnet
caged and preened piped brilliantly of lovers’
passion and a'lover’s feverish delights. It
was an afterflow with a hectic flush, maybe ;
but the light has lasted, and the throb of
the lyre still thrills.
Professor Arber’s “Dryden Anthology”
keynotes on Dryden naturally—on Dryden
master of the artificial Muse, and just com-
ing to his noon-age at the Restoration. Ten
years later he was Laureate, and faithful to
the king who fed him ; but there was
always too much intellectual admixture
in Dryden’s lyrics. Andrew Marvell, maybe
more sophisticated, seems yet to cull a more
fragrant blossom of emotion. Avoiding his
better-known pieces, has not this a dainty
flavour ?■—of Ametas and Thestylis making
hay-ropes—
Ametas. Think’st thou, that this love can stand,
Whilst thou still dost say me “Nay !”?
Love unpaid does soon disband ;
Love binds love, as hay binds hay !
Thestylis. Think’st thou, that this rope would
twine
If we both should turn one. way ?
Where both parties so combine,
Neither love will twist ; nor hay.
Ametas. Thus, you vain excuses find ;
Which yourself and us delay !
And Love ties a woman’s mind
Looser than with ropes of hay!
Thestylis. What you cannot constant hope,
Must be taken as you may I
Ametas. Then let’s both lay by our rope;
And go kiss within the hay !
But it is John Wilmot, Earl of Roches-
ter, who is the type of the Restoration lyrist
—dead at 33, but crowding into his short life
more passion, more emotion, more pang of*
pain arid pleasure than half-a-dozen devout cits,
could boast on turning up respectable toes
at respectable 72. The moralists are dis-
gusted with himx-but he lived. He was
born in the spring of 1647, was a scholar
and traveller in his teens, and before he was
twenty was fighting the Dutch with a gay
courage which made men marvel. When he
came back to Court he diced, wenched,
swore, fought, and wrote with the best of the
roystering brotherhood; and—perhaps—re-
pented on his deathbed—when there was
nothing else to do. And he wrote this for
Sylvia—
I promised Sylvia to be true ;
Nay, out of zeal, I swore it too !
And that she might believe me more,
Gave her in writing what I swore.
Not vows, nor oaths, can Lovers bind 1
So long as blessed, so long they’re kind !
’T was in a leaf ! The wind but blew;
Away both Leaf and Promise flew !
George Etherege, the dramatist, was a
bottle of the same vintage, but not from the
same cuvee. He carried the English melan-
choly with a light hand—
TO A LADY,
Asking him how long he would love her.
It is not, Celia, in our power
To say how long our love will last!
It may be, we, within this hour,
May lose those joys we now do taste I
The Blessed, that immortal be,
From change in love are only free !
Then, since we mortal Lovers are,
Ask not, How long our love will last ?
But while it does let us take care
Each minute be with pleasure past !
Were it not madness, to deny
To live; because we ’re sure to die !
And this is no less neatly finished with the
antithesis—
Ye happy Swains, whose hearts are free
Erom Love’s imperial chain,
Take warning, and be taught by me,
T’ avoid th’ enchanting pain !
Fatal the wolves, to trembling flocks !
Fierce*winds, to blossoms prove !
To careless seamen, hidden rocks!
To human quiet, Love !
Ely the Eair Sex ! if bliss you prize.
The snake’s beneath the flower !
Who ever gazed on beauteous eyes,
That tasted quiet more ?
How faithless is the Lovers’ joy !
How oonstant is their care !
The Kind, with falsehood do destroy ;
The Cruel, with despair !
There are Prior, and Otway, and George
Granville to reckon with ; but pass to Sir
Charles .Sedley, “ iiotoriousest for debauch-
ery and wit ’’—and in virtue of a dozen
songs immortal. For he wrote
Ah ! Cloris ! that I now could sit,
And
Phillis ! men say, that all my vows
And
Love still has something of the sea ;
From whence his mother rose.
And all the other tender pieces that two
centuries have cherished. This is no less
well known, but
Not, Celia ! that I juster am,
Or better than the rest!
For I would change, each hour, like them ;
Were not my heart at rest ! ’
But I am tied to very Thee,
By every thought I have !
Thy face I only care to see !
Thy heart I only crave !
All that in Woman is adored,
In thy dear self I find !
For the whole Sex can but afford
The Handsome and the Kind !
Why then, should I seek farther store ;
And still make love anew ?
When Change itself can give no more,
’T is easy to be true !
It is not possible to surpass that.
Then the gay D’Urfey, who rather wrote
in the mode than lived in it—
Some thirty, or forty, or fifty, at least,
Or more, I have loved in vain, in vain !
But if you ’ll vouchsafe to receive a poor guest;
For once, I will venture again, again !
How long I shall be in this mind, this mind,
Is totally in your own power !
All my days I can pass with the Kind, the Kind;
But I ’ll part with the Proud in an hour !
Then if you ’ll be good-natured, and civil, and
civil;
You ’ll find I can be so too, so too !
But if not, you may go, you may go to the
Devil;
Or the Devil may come to you, to you !
And ’fc is time to end this roundabout,
passing even Nahum Tate’s “ Hurricane,”
and a score of other famous pieces. Close
with the best tobacco-poem extant—and the
author unknown ! It was published with
music in a “Wit and Mirth” collection,
1699.,
Tobacco is but an Indian weed,
Grows green in the morn; cut down at eve.
It shows our decay.
We are but clay !
Think of this, and take Tobacco !
The Pipe, that is so lily-white,
Wherein so many take delight,
Is broke with a touch.
Man’s life is such !
Think of this, and take Tobacco !
The Pipe, that is so foul within,
Shews how Man’s soul is stained with sin.
It does require
To be purged with fire !
Think of this, and take Tobacoo !
The Ashes, that are left behind,
Do serve to put us all in mind,
That unto dust,
Return we must!
Think of this, and take Tobacoo !
The Smoke, that does so high ascend,
Shews you Man’s life must have an end.
The vapour’s gone !
Man’s life is done !
Think of this, and take Tobacco !
Circular received —
Mr. Arliss Andrews has pleasure in presenting for
review this copy of “ Aurelia,” by Arthur Maquarie, the
published price of which is Is. Note.—Mr. Arthur Ma-
quarie, who is an Australian and a B.A. of the Sydney
University, has recently been much quoted in London,
where he has gained appreciation both in prose and verse,
and one of his poems has been set to music by Sir
Alexander Mackenzie. His first literary effort to appear
in the public press was honoured with a place at the head
of the “Bards from the Backblocks” column in the
Sydney . Bulletin. The accompanying short poem
(“ Aurelia ”) was written in Spain.
It might as well have been printed in Spain-
though there is no reason why it should be printed
anywhere.
When David Mitchell, who is by way of being
a millionaire (of books), offered to bequeath his
library to N.S. Wales, he conditioned a special
trust to preserve them ; and it seemed a good
occasion to remodel existing trusts. So a short
Act discussed N.S.W. Art Gallery and
Public Library together, in a manner of
speaking ; and a Leg. Council friend of
the Art Society interpolated a clause permitting
them to nominate two trustees-to balance the exe-
crated protagonist of the Society of Artists.
Julian Ashton (there may be better artists round
about, but none with better brains) has long
renounced, deferent to clamour, the privi-
lege of selling pictures to the Gallery which
he trustees ; and the trustees of the other
Society —— could do no less. Couldn’t
they ? The Art Society nominated Lister
Lister and Arthur Collingridge, and specially
resolved that they might continue to sell pictures
to the Gallery over which they are placed in
authority. There was, it is alleged, a tacit un-
derstanding that they should not sell, and they
say they will not; but, O, the hold they give the
enemy ! —who has a move in reserve, by the way.
For the gate is opened to all the old strife which
it closed.
Obituary notices of R. D. Blackmore have
stressed the superiority of “Lorna Doone” with a
note of wonder; and it is true, as alleged, that
other of Blaokmore’s romances show an equal
skill. The difference is that V Lorna Doone ”is
based on fact, and has the vitality of fact;
“ Cradock Nowell ” and the rest are invented, and
are only the shadows of fact. Nothing, nothing
like a basis of life to rest a living story on. Lack-
ing the real D’Artagnan, Dumas would never
have created that unimaginable Musketeer. Then
“Lorna Doone ” has the two obvious elements of
romance in the highest degree. Romance in-
weaves strength with beauty. Blackmore took
the giant strength of Jan Ridd and married it to
the fairy-beauty of “Lorna Doone” —and a good
deal of the rest went without telling. But Lorna,
whom he imagined, is always less vital than girt
Jan, whom he described on the basis of tradition.
Add the smack of the Devonshire soil —the taste
of the. Devonshire cream —and you have the where-
withal of semi-perennial charm.
Whisper, spring-wind softly singing ;
Whisper in my ear,
Respite and nepenthe bringing,
Can the goal be near :
.Laden with the dew of vespers,
From the fragrant sky ;
In my ear the wind that whispers,
Seems to make reply
“ Question not, but live and labour
Till yon goal be won ;
Helping every feeble neighbour,
Seeking help from none;
Life is mostly froth and bubble,
Two things stand like stone :
Kindness in another’s trouble,
Courage in your own.”
Gordon therefore may either use the inverted commas to
show he is in effect quoting what the wind whispers, or
again that the lines are not original. He uses quotation
marks in two other places in same poem. As to the old-
lettered variant with “ mainly ” for “ mostly,” it was first
pointed out —as occurring over the mantel in a room of a
great ancient house at Windsor —through an article on
“A Hying Ghost” in The Speaker for Aug. 19, 1899.
Surely, setting aside the question of inverted commas not
meaning he.was quoting—is it not possible for the mantel
motto to have been copied from Gordon’s poem itself—
-1866- For Gordon’s admitted references to the sources of
his quoted lines, as instanced in “ A Preface and a Piracy”
from E. A. Poe—and elsewhere—hardly warrant one
accusing Gordon of actual bare-faced plagiary on evidence
such as you mention.
Well, you sec, it was “pretty Fanny’s way” (see
R.P. 22/5/97). But Gordon was only arraigned;
he was not judged. Perhaps somebody will tell
us the apparent date of the Windsor verse.
The Bookfellow.
THE COFFIN-SHIP.
They patched her topsides here and there —they could not
patch beneath :
Her timbers were a rotten pulp inside their copper sheath ;
The shipwright swore to the carpenter, as the carpenter
looked askance,
“By God 1 there’s never a bolt will hold': the must
take her chance !
Her keel’s adrift, and her bilges shift—to call her ship is
a shame ;
But the sailors’ lives are the owner’s risk—let the owner
take the blame!
We ’re paid to paint and potter around, and we ’ll paint
and potter her well;
It’s none of our business where she goes—let the go
to hell 1 ”
They patched her topsides here and there ; they dumped
the coal-freight in:
And every ton was another blow t<3 sever her bones from
her skin ;
She’d spued her oakum in the dock, she sprung a leak in
port,
A child could have read her doom of dread—but sailors’
sight is. short;
For a sailor’s life is a reckless life, and Jack must smother
his whim:
When women and liquor have eaten his pay, he’s articled
,—sink or swim !
Nine times in ten he’s safe again, and the tenth time
he ’ll pull through :
The eleventh time is the Devil’s own time—and the coffin-
ship gets her due.
They shipped her crew of reckless men ; they towed her
out to sea,
With her quaking hull.and her shivering spars; that
groaned of the grave to be ;
She had been a good-enough ship in her day, but her day
had long since ceased,
And the old hulk sung her dirge as she flung a desperate
head to the East; —
Wallowing in the trough of the waves, lumbering like an
ox,
With her sticks astrain till they yelled with the pain, and
no more lift than a box ;
While the captain watched by the ripping side, and said,
with his red face pale,
“ If she sings her psalm like this in a calm, what ’ll she do
in a gale ?”
The lighthouse hardly winked its last before the forehold
rose :
They manned the pumps and split their hearts to raise
her ducking nose ;
The boats were rotten as the ship—they sweated at a raft
. Till a black wave found her waterlogged and drove the
wretches aft;
Her bows were weltering in the seas, her stem was shiver-
ing high,
They heard the coals go thundering, and knew the end
was nigh ;
They cursed the owner and the craft, and braced them-
selves to drown,
And ’twixt a flurry and a sob the coffin-ship dived down.
The owner vents a chastened grief—God’s will must be
endured,
The sailors’ children cry for bread—but they were not
insured;
The owner eats with appetite, and drinks the best of
wine—
. The y’ve done with appetites who gulped their last long
drink of brine;
The owner’s bed is softest down, and all is to his whim,
Yet they sleep sounder in the ooze who ’re sacrificed to
him •
And I swear that theirs is the happier fate, who gave
their lives for his coal —
They only sank with his rotten ship, he swims with his
rotten soul.
"The Dryden Anthology.”
’Tis Woman makes us love!
’T is Love that makes us sad I
’Tis Sadness makes us drink;
And Drinking makes us mad !
ANON.
Writes E. Wilson Dobbs—
Regarding reference to Gordon’s (so-called) plagiarisms
in issue of Feb. 10, the lines in question—with “ mostly ’’
for “ mainly ” (Gordon’s own variant) are often printed
with modernised spelling in English periodicals—without
author’s name—as a sort of motto. As example, see
under “ Two Things ” in a booklet called “ Home Chat,”
1 for Feb. 12th, 1898. Gordon may thus have utilised them
from some old ballad. As originally appearing in “ Bell’s
Life in Victoria” for Nov., 1866—and in all subsequent
editions of G’s poems—this penultimate verse of “ Finis
Exqptatus ” is enclosed within quotation marks. The
lines run-
THE OLD MAWS WISH.
If I live to grow old (for I find I go down !)
Let this be my fate in a country town !
Let me have a warm house, with a stone at the
gate ;
And a cleanly young girl to rub my bald pate !
May I govern my Passion with, an absolute sway!
And grow wiser and better, as my strength wears
away,
Without gout or stone, by. a gentle decay !
In a country town, by a murmuring brook,
The ocean at distance, on which I may look ;
With a spacious plain, without hedge or stile,
And an easy pad-nag to ride out a mile.
With a pudding on Sunday, and stout humming
liquor,
And remnants of Latin to puzzle the Vicar;
With a hidden reserve of Burgundy wine,
To drink the King’s Health as oft as I dine.
With Plutarch and Horace, and one or two more
Of the best Wits that lived in the Ages before;
With a dish of roast mutton, not venison, or teal,
And clean, though coarse, lirten at every meal...
With courage undaunted, may I face my last day;
And, when I am dead, may the better sort say,
“ In the morning, when sober ; in the evening,
when mellow :
He is gone, and has left not behind him his
fellow !
For he governed his Passion with an absolute
sway !
And grew wiser and better, as his strength wore
away,
Without gout or stone, by a gentle decay.”

WHAT IS CATARRH ?
n
M EDICATOH
OATARRH is inflammation of the
w lining membrane of the nose
and adjoining passages. If this in-
flammation is not arrested it invades
the passages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the sight and
hearing, destroys the sense of taste
and smell, renders the breath offen-
sive, breaks down the affected
tissues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the small
frontal bones of the skull. The putrid
discharge passing through the lungs
and stomach causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want relief and
cure? If so, try our great remedy. It
has no equal.

What looks like originality, but is only
another instance of the hold “ shop ” has on the
minds of some people, is the recent gruesome
suicide of a London baker. After baking a batch
of bread he appears to have become suddenly tired
of the awful monotony of dough, got into his oven
and secured the door, undressed himself and laid
down on a bag. Being a careful baker with a
reputation to consider he evidently regulated the
heat to suit the circumstances, and when found
was done to a turn, or as the cheerful papers
reported it “ with a light brown er 't all over.”
HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
niav be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. Yor may have attended various hospitals and had
jiedical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CURE YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured.
Send at once for

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“His” Grievance!
When Rome had reft with impious hand
The wives and maids of Sabine land,
All right and justice spurning ;
The injured nation gripped the steel
And marched along to battle-peal,
For blood and vengeance burning.
The night before they drew to Rome,
The warriors from a distant home
In soldier-wise uproarious,
Were wild of speech, and loud and long,
For each was bent to right his Wrong
By valiant fight and glorious.
But one there was who walked apart
With sighs that seemed to rend his heart
And words of bitter railing ;
It grieved his gallant comrades sore
To note the weary look he bore,
His sorrow unavailing.
“ ’Tis sure a wight,” the warriors cried,
“ Who also lost his tender bride
The time of our disaster ! ”
They spoke him kindly, bade him cheer —
“ To-morrow hails a vict’ry dear,
And Rome a Sabine master ! ”
The soldier slowly raised his head,
“ ’Tis true, my comrades dear,” he said,
“ I fiercely hate the Roman.
I hope to meet him, steel to steel,
And make his perjured bosom feel
In me his fellest foeman.
“ I know the Wrong that fires your brain,
The stolen spouse and virgin train
The hearth and home forsaken ;
But Pve a heavier score to pay,
For by some chance that fatal day,
My wife was never taken ! ”
Brisbane.
P. LUGTIG.
The GreyhounD of the Moon.
They harry the wild Antarctic,
They sweep the still lagoon —
The Chargers of the Ocean,
The Greyhounds of the Moon.
They follow her round the Planet
In a lon-/ unending siuin / ;
They break on the sandy beaches,
And this is the song they sing
We have come from the Uttermost Ocean,
We have followed the changing sphere
From island unto island,
In the wake of the marching year.
We have plunged in the Roaring Forties,
A thousand leagues from shore :
We have raced round the world for ages,
We will race for ages more.
We have ridden past lone Kerguelen,
We have washed the Golden Gate ;
We have dashed up the bleak Lolander
As we surged through Foveaux Strait.
We have fretted the Falkland Islands
Since the Falkland Isles were born ;
We have cast the wrecks on Agulhas,
And the icebergs on Cape Horn.
Where the burning mountain’s beacon
Lights up the midn 'g'it sky,
Where the sperm whales all assemble
And the albatrosses fly,
The whaler, fleeing northward
From the long midwinter night,
And the floes that crash and splinter
Acknowledge our sovereign might.
We stretch from the Pole to the Tropics—
From atoll to iceberg drear,
Below us lie the cables,
Above, the steamers steer ;
We carry the white-wing’d wool-ships,
We hurry the Homeward Mail,
And we bear the ’Frisco clippers
On the long Pacific trail.
We have come from the Uttermost Ocean,
We have followed the changing sphere
From island unto island,
In the wake of the marching year ;
We harry the wild Antarctic,
We sweep the still lagoon—
The Chargers of the Ocean,
The Greyhounds of the moon.
A. E. CURRIE.
New Version.
I made a song to Love—
And Love in kingly might
Unbent and said:
“ Thy song hath pleased me quite,
What wouldst thou have ? ”
I answered, “ Give me sight.”
He gave, and 10, 1 saw
The fool his breath had bred
In shape of me ;
I made a dagger red
With blood —but found
’Twas my own heart that bled.
Then where his praise was spoke
I raised a song above
In his despite,
But powerlessly I strove ;
For he sings ill
Who says harsh things of Love.

war is over. Possibly they won’t come
about just then—after every war there is
going to be a stupendous re-organisation of
things, but, as a rule, the weariness of large
bodies asserts itself, and the re-organisation
is postponed till a more convenient season.
Still there always comes a time when it can
be postponed no longer, and if this time
isn’t the time in question it looks something
very like it. Britain is beginning to talk
seriously about a conscription now, and
about adopting the hated military servitude
that weighs down continental nations, and
dropping a whole lot of its boasted freedom
overboard. Also, it is beginning to talk of
many other things that used to be abhorrent
to British ideas. The dire necessity for
becoming a great military power is fairly in
sight, and a very pleasant fool's paradise has
burst, or is going to burst, or at least is a
good deal cracked.
• • * *
For the first time in two centuries or so
Britain has gone into a serious war without
an ally. Certainly it didn’t look like a
serious war to begin with, and it shouldn’t
have been one, but it proved to be one all
the same. It was also a war in which the
British navy could do no actual fighting.
The enemy was just about the smallest
civilised nation on this earth, with little
money as well as few men. Despite all that
has been said about the great wealth which
the Transvaal Government derived from tax-
ing the Outlander population the annual
revenue of both the Boer States put
together was only about half that of
N.S.W., and the Boer population of both
States isn’t half the population of Sydney !
They are vastly less fitted in visible
resources to give back-talk to the big-
gest empire on earth than N.S.W. is. Even
the small revenue they have is mostly of
recent date. The Free State has never had
an income of over £400,000 a year. The
Transvaal was in the same situation till the
gold discoveries, and the whole revenue
which it collected in all the years since then
is just about equal to what Britain spends on
defence in a single year of peace. The im-
mense armaments and the immense array of
mercenaries which the Transvaal is said to
possess can’t be so very large after all, for
the means to purchase them has always been
wanting. A country whose revenue has
never been more than a quarter that of
Belgium, or nearly half that of Holland, or
more than half that of N.S.W.—which
stands about on a par with Norway and
Switzerland, and doesn’t even approach
Victoria, and which had very little revenue
of any kind till a few years ago, can’t very
well have built up such stupendous defences
as the Transvaal is often credited with.
• * • »,
And now that these two flyspecks have
kept Britain at bay for four months the fact
has become obvious that the British army,
as armies go nowadays, is small potatoes and
few in a hill. In Napoleon’s time it was a
reasonably large army as compared with
those of Continental Europe. Now, when
Britain meets even a very small enemy who
can force it to fight wholly on land, its forces
appear to be wretchedly inadequate. By
reason of the enormous spreading of the
Empire, and the ceaseless earth-swallowing
of recent years, the number of enemies who
can force Britain to fight them on land grows
constantly larger. Also, the spread of rail-
ways is constantly making the big Empire
more accessible by land and less defensible
by sea. Some day Russia, which is
practically unapproachable by sea, must
needs compel Britain to fight on land
in Asia, and Russia is jn’obably worth
the two Boer Republics 12 times over and
something to spare. The last gaudy war
episode in British history was that when
Britain and three other nations spent two
years taking one Russian town, and that was
a coastal row where the British navy was of
some service. So Britain, having built up a
huge empire without making any adequate
arrangements for its defence, begins to talk
at last of the necessity for conscription or
some sort of compulsory military service.
It may not come just yet, but it is coming
almost to a certainty.
* * * *
Already the British Government sees its
way to a necessity for spending £.10,000,000
a year more in defence, and even this scheme
is declared to be a mere makeshift and
wholly inadequate. If the defence bill
piles up very much higher something will
almost certainly happen to the great Free-
trade policy merely through the need for
more revenue, for the burden of direct
taxation is already very heavy and can’t
stand indefinite increase. The millennium,
when the British national debt will be
all paid off, and the appalling burden which
Britain accumulated at the beginning of this
century by trying to act the part of a father
to Europe in general will be cleared away,
seems to be postponed for a while, and the
necessary increase of armaments may further
postpone it. Hitherto none of the great
States of Europe has shouldered the immense
contract of trying to be a great sea and land
power at the same time, but now Britain
appears to have run up hard against the
..necessity of being both. Or if it hasn’t yet
actually run up against it, the time can be
foreseen when the necessity will certainly
arise. And when considering the need for
a greatly enhanced army it may also be
necessary to consider where that army is to
come from. In the days of the Napoleonic
wars Ireland and the Scotch Highlands and
the English agricultural districts supplied
Britain’s best troops. They have all been
more or less depopulated since then. Rich
Jews and rich Gentiles, imported Germans,
and Americans who made vast fortunes in
pork have bought up Highland estates
wholesale, and given Britain’s best fighting
material notice to quit so as to make room
for sheep or grouse or deer. Also British
noblemen have fired out their own country-
men wholesale for similar reasons. Some-
body in Poland made a desert and called it
peace. The Highland landlord made a
desert and called it a grouse moor. Out of
its intense regard for the rights of property
and the maxims of Freetrade, the British
Government has allowed short fat foreigners
and others to eject from Britain a great part
of Britain’s best defenders. Some day the
need for suppressing the old British nobility
and the rich British landowners as disloyal
institutions will have to be seriously con-
sidered.
» • * *
As another result of the present trouble
in South Africa, Imperial Federation is
again beginning to come in sight in an
uncertain sort of way. Sundry Australian
politicians, with little discretion and a great
rush of military manoeuvres to the head, have
been allowed to lay it down as an axiom
that it is now Australia’s duty to
bear a large and cordial hand in all Britain’s
wars, be the cause good or indifferent.
They have even gone further and at-
tempted to lay it down as an axiom that
it is treason and base disloyalty to have
any doubts about the goodness of any cause
in which Britain is involved. And a very large
section of the community has accepted both
ideas in a time of wild excitement, and gone
into many public-houses in ferocious search of
people who looked as if they disagreed with
them. If these ideas continue on top it seems
reasonably certain that Imperial Federation
is coming sooner or later. The honor and
privilege of taking part in all British wars
will naturally suggest the equally notable
honor and privilege of taking a hand in the
foreign policy which makes these wars. The
country which wants to take part in shaping
the destinies of the empire by doing the
commonplace job of carrying a heavy gun
and a lot of ammunition and a bag of pro-
vender on the field of action isn’t likely to
stop there. It is almost certain to want to
go further and help shape these destinies on
a larger scale. Then Australia will carry its
share of the burdens of the empire regularly,
instead of doing a casual lift when it feels
that way, and its regular share is estimated
at about £2,000,000 a year, with more to
follow as population increases. Already this
country’s willingness to bear a hand has
induced sundry British authorities to point
out that £2,000,000 a year is the amount
Australia ought fairly to contribute, and one
or two Australian politicians have declared,
at banquets and elsewhere, that the idea is
very reasonable, and the remark has been
well received on the whole.
* * * •
It begins to look by no means certain that
a time may not come when Imperial Federa-
tion will be the less of two evils. If it is to
be a question of Australia taking part in all
British wars without any voice in the making
of them, or of doing the same with a voice
in the making of them, the latter is
certainly the more dignified arrangement. If
it is also the more expensive—well, Aus-
tralia has risen up so extensively to declare
that it doesn’t mind the expense when the
interests of Britain are involved that it
can’t seriously object to that. If an arrange-
ment is made whereby Australia has to
supply troops as a matter of duty and plain
business, it has this advantage over supply-
ing them voluntarily—there will be less frill
about the proceedings, fewer speeches, less
pomp, glory, drink, banquet and upheav-
ing of small men to pose as the parties
who saved the empire because they
donated a horse with a dubious fore-
leg. And if Australia is going into the
contingent business as a continuous thing,
there is this much to be gained by sending
plenty of contingents : Where 1000 contin-
genters are liable to be offensively and arro-
gantly drunk for many days on their return,
40,000 of them would doubtless be reason-
ably sober because there wouldn’t be enough
people to buy drink for so large a number,
and being so much more common, they
would also be much less arrogant.
* » * •
In one way and another it certainly looks
just now as if the little Boer scramble was
going to produce a great many changes for
its size. Certainly it seems to have brought
the possibility of Imperial Federation nearer
than it ever was before. Australia at pre-
sent is in the mood to do almost anything.
By way of a casual sign of the times it
is worth noting that the A.N.A., that
organisation which is so surprised at being
born in its own country that it has formed a
great league and covenant by way of record-
ing f he fact, has began to talk over the
proposition that the time really has arrived
at last when a permanent legislative union
with Britain is called for. If the Salis-
bury Government had a feasible scheme of
Imperial Federation ready now, when the
popular excitement is still at red heat, almost
anything might happen—even an agreement
to pay £2,000,000 a year as our share of the
Imperial defence bill. Certainly if popular
frenzy keeps up to boiling point much
longer it is almost certain that Australia will
do something remarkable and permanently
unusual, and joining an Imperial Federation
looks about as probable as many other
follies.
Queensland—a Suburb of Asia.
Queensland just now is very like a meerschaum
pipe in the process of being colored. The popula-
tion was not long ago white, but the gradual
mixture of Malays, Chinese, Javanese, Japanese,
Kanakas, and the rest, is gradually turning it to
a warm brown chocolate color. A Geraldton
(N.Q.) correspondent gives an idea of how things
are done in that wettest township of Australia.
At Geraldton, on the Johnstone River, N.Q., there are
two main industries—first, that carried on exclusively by
Japanese, called by someone the oldest trade in the
world ; secondly, gambling, which is chiefly in the hands
of the Chinese, though the Malays have particular games
fancied by the Javanese coolies. The most profitable way
to use land is to rent it to Japanese or Chinese for either
of these industries. There are games for all tastes and
pockets. Fantan is for those who have received their
wages. But you can gamble with the smallest sums.
To meet the requirements of schoolboys there is a set of
tickets price only threepence. The prizes for these vary
from sevenpence for one lucky daub to ten pounds for
the whole ten. The schoolboy who gets sixpence hurries
to his favorite “John” and buys from him two tickets.
He comes to school through “ Chinatown ” in the morn-
ing, places his money at investment, and at the mid-day
recess calls on “John” to see if a dividend has been
declared. More often than not there is none ; but the
boy does not draw all blanks. About twelve months ago
a little boy’s mother gave him a shilling on his birthday.
With this he bought four tickets, of which one gained 355.
Train up a child in the way he shall go.
* • * *
The public school is in Chinatown, so that the boys may
not have far to go to the gambling-den. Within a hun-
dred yards of the school fence are at least seven gambling-
houses on one side of the street. On the other is a perfect
labyrinth of gambling-banks, Japanese temples of Venus,
and Malay boarding-houses. It is no unusual thing to see
numbers of boys in this maze. The Malays, less expert
in the art of fraud than the Chinese and Japanese, play
games which seem to give the novice a fair chance.
Accordingly, some Europeans may often be seen playing
with them, and the boys come to look on, and to be
initiated into all the mysteries of Asia.
* • * •
Young white girls love to watch the athletic contests
of the Japanese, and they do not all come from the im-
mediate neighborhood of “Chinatown.” Many are led
thither by the Salvation Army. Soon after dinner on
Sunday the big drum beats near the Japanese quarters,
greatly to the discomfort of the gamblers. As there ig
no Protestant church in Geraldton. many mothers who
would not otherwise think of allowing their children near
the Asiatic quarter on Sundays (they cannot help their
going there to school during the rest of the week) permit
them to go out with the “ Army.”
* * * *
There is in Geraldton a newspaper called the World
and, from the number of races that inhabit the town, the
name is not altogether inappropriate. The eloquent
editor is never weary of vaunting the natural beauties of
the country round. Nature has furnished Geraldton with
two hills ; upon one is the R.O. church ; on the other the
Joss House. From the Joss House you can see a prospect
which you cannot get from Sydney Post Office tower.
Thick as holes in an ant-bed are a collection of hovels, out
of which hundreds of black, yellow, and brown people
swarm. The cabins are all low, built of rough shingles
and the boards from old cases. Only in the street are
they roofed with iron ; at the back they are covered
with wood or grass. There are no windows.
* » • *
These huts are built most thickly along the banks of a
creek. The “ sanitary accommodation ”is ! Close
to the street the person going into one hovel rubs
against the office i belonging to the next. Two or
three buildings at the junctions of two streets are cut
off from the rest. Here four saplings are stuck in the
ground ; the roof consists of sheets of bark and the walls
of pieces of tents and bags. This serves for a Japanese
temple, a boarding-house out of which twenty Coolies
may sometimes be seen to come, and a Chinese' “ bank.”
It is commonly believed (though the writer cannot vouch
for it) that some of the land on which the buildings are
crowded most closely together belongs to the Q. Govern-
ment, and is leased to residents who sublet it to its
present inhabitants. Why not? What else does Boodle-
wraith exist for but to fill its friends’ pockets.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Piece of Paper With Some Ink On It.
Premier John Porrest, of Westralia, and his
mentor and blind guide, Hackett, both laugh de-
risively at the goldfields’ demand for fair Parlia-
mentary representation and at the Goldfields’
Separation movement, just as equally dull persons
laughed at the possibility of a revolution in
France, or of a locomotive travelling on rails. In
fact, everything new moves some dull person to
laughter. Forrest and Hackett, and the other
dull people, have a childish faith in the defensive
virtues of a bit of paper with some ink on it. The
W.A. Constitution says the Queen may grant
separation at her pleasure. The Colonial Boun-
daries Act says that separation shall in no case be
granted without the consent of the local Legisla-
ture —the one which is stuffed by the representa-
tives of F orrest’s pocket-boroughs. And Forrest
and Hackett, being confident that the latter
Act overrules the former, are content. If
the piece of paper with ink on it decides
in their favor they feel satisfied and safe,
and they go on refusing the goldfields even
a fifth of their fair share of Parliamentary
representation with a light heart. Yet the British
Parliament, which passed the Colonial Boundaries
Act, may also repeal it, and if sufficient occasion
arose it probably would do so. That is one
danger of which the two dull persons take no
sufficient account. And there is another one of
which they take no account at all. Underneath
the constitutional movement for Separation there
already exist the beginnings of another move-
ment. There always is one movement under-
neath another in suoh cases. If the British Par
As It Was in the Beginning.
Ablaze the Heavens shone with light and glory,
the happy laughter of an angel throng
Rang out among the hills of Paradise, and echoed
down the tide an angel’s song.
But Lucifer, black-browed and lowly muttering,
curseth the music of the heavenly choir.
“ Curse on this ceaseless calm, these fadeless
flowers—all, God ! that I might follow my
desire! ”
Straightway the music ceased, the glory faded,
the stricken daisies drooped upon the sod,
And the black shadow of a mighty sorrow sat
brooding on the face of Heaven’s God.
“ And what is thy desire, oh, Discontented—
what lackest thou for thy delight in Heaven ?
Speak thy desire, and, by the love I bear thee,
that which thou seekest shall to thee be given.”
Then Satan spake—“ These fair and fadeless
flowers, the changeless glory and the radiant
throng,
Are gall to me, oh dead and changeless ages ! Ah,
Gop ! ah, God ! it is for this I long—
To fashion for myself a world where beings shall
- battle on through years of changing life,
The strong to match the strong ; my being thrills
to watch the wondrous chances of the strife.
“Ah, for the spirit of a being striving to rise, to
conquer, and to overcome,
Not like this throng of angel hosts about thee
content to circle round one mighty sun ;
But I would hold a world of mine own making
where though a being climbed to dizzy height,
There still should something be to lure him on-
ward, some greater battle yet for him to
fight.”
“ Have then thy wish ” —the voice of God was
speaking—“have then thy wish and since it
must be so,
Lucifer, most proud and most beloved, the eyes
of God shall follow as ye go.”
Then Satan turned him from the home of God
with all its glory loathsome to his sight,
And through the crystal gates he shame-faced
strode into the outer darkness of the night;
There mightily he wrought with all his power till
earth and sea to their completion ran,
Until his dream sprang to fulfilment and a world
laid bounty at the feet of man.
Then Satan cried aloud in ecstacy: “Strive ye
and strain in all the ways of strife—
’Tis thus alone ye tread the paths of Gods, ’tis
thus alone ye know the gift of life.”
And so men strove, the strong still rising higher,
the weaker in the dust were forced to lie,
Until with breaking hearts they called for succor,
and calling vainly gave it up to die ;
Then God called unto Satan: “See ye this—is
this thy great dream’s thrice accursed goal ?
Lo, unto these who suffer in my sight I give the
gift of an immortal soul.
These mortals who have suffered for thy sake
when I did weakly yield unto thy pride,
Shall come unto the glory that ye scorned—and
not in vain shall they have lived and died.
“Time and again I came into their life —suffered
with them in all their narrow ways,
Tasted with them the bitterness of strife, and
feared with them the coming of the days,
As Buddha did I wander through the East,
teaching of Love unto the sons of men—
And when Prometheus suffered on the rock thy
God in mortal body suffered then ;
The Galilean, He whom men called Christ, who
yielded up His life in bloody pain,
He was thy God, and in the name of Love I yet
may come again and yet again.”
C.P.Q.C.


liament does not grant Separation and the Forrest
crowd still refuses the Goldfields anything dimly
resembling fair representation, the men who are
organising this second movement propose to get
Separation by the simple process of separating.
This is a chance which so far no one appears to
have seriously considered. The Goldfields have a
considerable population, and it has the great
advantage of being a concentrated population.
They could probably raise a larger force of large,
muscular men in a day than all the rest of W.A.
could get together in a week. If they got
really angry they could separate in an informal,
off-hand, low-comedy sort of way at any time, and
if John Forrest sent all his available forces
against them, they could either buy over the forces
by offering them a higher salary and an extra plug
of tobacco, or else disarm them and pour “ shy-
poo ” over them in sign of friendship. The engi-
neers of this subterranean idea are already taking
stock of the fact that the W.A. Contingent, now
away in the Transvaal acquiring a large and cheer-
ful contempt for peaceful methods, and helping to
assert the principle that the Outlander should have
equal Parliamentary representation with the Boer,
consists mostly of Outlanders, and it considers
that they may be put to unexpected uses when
they come back if the grievances of the W.A.
goldfields are then still unredressed. And, for the
rest, they go on the fact that, even without them,
the Goldfields could turn out enough real men to
take peaceful possession of the country and the
Parliament, and to disfranchise Bunbury and
Perth, and stand Fremantle up on its ear. And,
after all, the principal force that the Forrest
crowd has to set against this is a piece of paper
with some ink on it.
Wanted: A Stringent Building Act.
Spruson, M.P., has written to the N.S. Wales
Health Department, recommending the destruc-
tion of certain filthy hovels in his own electorate
—Gipps Division, Sydney. Now, “destruction”
in the matter of architectural obliteration means
the measure of justice meted out to absolute
unsafety—to filth, very, very seldom, though the
threatenings of the rat plague may operate in
wholesome terrorism in this connection, and impel
the authorities to condemn houses on the ground
of unsafety which are filthy but substantial. Syd-
ney is one of some dozen world-spread cities
which have grown up in the last hundred years,
and it is about the worst built of them all. A
crying need is a stringent Building Act, which
would give the central authorities absolute power
over the architectural present and future of the
city. The three requirements are safety, sanita-
tion, and beauty. No one should be allowed to
build as he likes. The horribly monotonous repe-
tition of terrace upon terrace, rows of exaggerated
pill-boxes in which dwell pallid people, ministers
■distinctly to the spirit of ugliness. The man who
■erects a shanty insults and outrages his neighbour
as much as if he struck him a blow on the eye ;
and the law should be put in operation to curtail
his opportunities for wickedness. In any closely-
packed Sydney suburb you will see, in row after
row, suffocating little houses, breathing into each
other’s faces, standing in undrained and unchan-
nelled streets, with ghastly back-yards arear, while
in front of each little man-kennel is a feculent
pool full of fever germs. The country around is,
perhaps, bleak, bare, and sandy, but adown the
slope over which the drainage runs, when the
stagnant pools overflow, the ground is green with
the greenness that grows only upon the grave.
But the crying residential horror is the wooden
house, the weatherboard cottage, always evidencing
the ravages of Decay’s enclutehing fingers, worm-
eaten and inflammable. The wooden tenement
is a relic of old colonial days, and a relic easily and
profitably to be dispensed with. All wooden
buildings should be pulled down, and none should
be permitted to be erected in the future. Brick
and stone should be the only materials used in
building, with as little woodwork as possible. The
abominable paling fence should be replaced every-
where with stone or urick walls, and should never
be repaired—and thereby perpetuated. Suburban
Sydney is a rats’ nest of insanitary, eye-affronting
wooden shanties, perfect fire-traps and life-traps.
It must be fresh in almost anybody’s recollection
that the terrible Redfern fire was nearly a holo-
caust of an entire district, and it broke out, and
was fed, by closely-packed wooden buildings.
The ideal Building Act should be given an
absolutely free hand in dealing with that suburban
monstrosity, the terrace. JSo contractor should
be permitted to lay a brick before the design is
approved by a central authority whose dictum in
matters of architectural taste should be final.
“Gonmade the country, and Man made the town,”
has been said with some approach to correctness.
As far as Sydney is concerned it might be
with greater truth remarked, “ God made
the Harbor, and Man spoiled the site.”
The people of Sydney breathe the atmosphere of
the commonplace, the tawdry, and the banal.
Indeed they are sunk so low in an aesthetic sense
that it is hardly possible to sink to a lower depth.
Their school-houses look like prisons, and child-
hood is from the very first immersed in something
like a cross between a lock-up and a fortress. The
young man and the young women are reared in
the weatherboard-cottage with the galvanized-
iron roof, or in the red-brick pill-box that forms
one of a dozen of similar pattern. What chance
has any sense of Beauty to develope in such
an environment ? Hideousness, squalor and in-
convenience are everywhere rampant; the while
things are going into a rut of petrified iniquity.
A stringent Building Act, stringently adminis-
tered, is the one thing needful by way of remedy.

Tasmanian Great Western Syndicate.
Premier Lewis on Tasmania’s Great Western
Railway syndicate:—
To see a railway connection between the southern por-
tion of Tasmania and the western mineral fields is one of
our sincerest wishes. The Great Western syndicate re-
ceived the right to construct this railway as long ago as
1898, and, at the same time, obtained liberal concessions
of land and of water power. It was then promised that the
money was available, hut up to the present little has been
done, and the construction of the railway seems as far off
as ever, while a large area of land has remained locked up.
Last session, the representative of the syndicate returned
from London, asking Parliament for certain amendments
to their Act and further rights, promising that, if
obtained, the company would proceed with the
work forthwith. These the Parliament sanctioned,
the company getting the most liberal treatment.
But even then they were not satisfied, and approached
the Government to take up £200,000 worth of debentures
on the terms of a prospectus which virtually put into the
promoters’ pockets almost a million of money in shares
and cash. The Government, though in no way fearing to
risk the payment of interest on the sum asked for, could
be no party to any such transaction, which might have
been used to induce others in England to take up the
debentures and shares upon the faith of the Government
becoming in a way partners with them. The concession
will lapse next August, unless the promoters commence
the work in a substantial manner, and in the event of the
■concession lapsing the Government will be prepared to
submit proposals to assist to a limited extent any bona
fidfe company formed solely for the purpose of construct-
ing the railway.
Spj according to Premier Lewis, he proposes to
begin fooling with another land-grant railway
syndicate, and all the bitter experience of the last
one is wasted on him. Which induces this paper
to arise for the severalth time and put this plain
business proposition to the men who do these
strange muddles on an island off the Victorian
coast. If a syndicate, which will < almost
certainly have to pay 5 per cent, interest
on its borrowings, can build the Great Western
Railway profitably, provided it gets a grant
of a million acres or some other amount of land to
help out its revenue, couldn’t the Tasmanian Rail-
way Department, which can raise money at 31 per
cent., build it a great deal more profitably if it got
the same grant of land to help out its revenue—
and then the country would get the profit ? Has
the Tasmanian railway management ever been so
much as asked if it could undertake to make the
line on these terms ? If the railway department
wouldn’t undertake to build the line profitably
without a land-grant, and the co. undertook to
build it loithout a land-grant, there would be every
reason to let the co. have the job. But to let the
co. build it ivith a huge land-grant because the
department can’t do it loithout one is a foolish,
illogical, rule-of-thumb proceeding, and an out-
rage on common sense.
O
Poor Higgins.
Last week’s discomfiture of Higgins was about
the most contemptible experience that a Vic.
Assembly has ever enjoyed. Five days previously
Higgins sprung a surprise upon the House by
giving notice of a motion to the effect that the
M‘Lean Govt., not being a representative Liberal
Govt., is unfit to hold office now that “the near
approach of the Federal elections renders of
supreme importance the solidarity of the Liberal
party.” The dismal equity lawyer was under-
stood to be taking action by arrangement
with ex-Premier Turner, and for the next three
days the M'Lean Ministry looked likely to die
young. Nobody could give any patriotic reason
why Higgins, after furiously hurling Iris “ humble
negative” at the Federation Bill and joyfully
assisting to throw Premier Turner out, should be
anxious to put Turner back again in the
interests of Federation, but on the other hand
nobody saw any particular reason why M 'Lean
and co. should not be thrown out in their turn,
therefore the intervention of Higgins was treated
as a deserving joke. But on the fourth day the
Tory Argus upset the Liberal show by reprinting
a speech uttered by hasty Higgins in the early
days of Contingent discussion, when it wasn’t
quite high treason to have doubts about the abso-
lute justice of the British cause in South
Africa and everywhere else. Obviously, the
present jingo “ feeling of the country” would
not tolerate Higgins after that. The re-
publication of his forgotten speech served to
remind the Liberal party that it could not con-
sent to get saved by the lawyer member for Gee-
long. There was no help for it but to repudiate
any verbal promise of support that Turner
or Peacock might have given. The safest Liberal
policy, under the circumstances, was to leave
Higgins to his fate. So when lie rose to attack
the M ‘Lean Govt, lie started with a confession of
his own absurdity in the matter, and went on to
admit he had merely united the Liberal party in
a stern determination not to support Higgins.
Then he was proceeding to withdraw his motion,
but some one pointed out to him that lie had
never moved the motion, and it didn’t need with-
drawing. So the motion withdrew itself, an* 1 the
M‘Lean Government still lives.

The Bushmen’s Muddle.
The New South Wales Bush Contingent is fast
getting beyond the stage of a public joke. Even
in its earlier and more respectable days the best
that could be said for it was that it was a clumsy
and stupidly mismanaged affair. At the beginning
the business of selecting the bushmen lay with men
some of whom didn’t know a bushman when they
saw one, and the business of selecting the horses
lay with men some of whom knew a horse with
reasonable certainty from a dog. Then there was
the demand for “ references” from squatters, and
some squatters began to pay off old grudges
against good bushmen who were unionists by
refusing them the almost necessary reference, and
giving it to cheap blacklegs whose chief
qualification was their willingness to work
below union rates. There was the rushing
of the Bushmen’s ranks by city hard
cases who knew little more of the bush
than can be seen at Moore Park ; the selec-
tion of men who could neither ride nor shoot, and
who paid other men to ride and shoot for them ;
the unspeakable muddlement which allowed this
personation to pass undetected until the public
taught the management something of its business
by pointing out the swindle ; and the appointment
of city lawyers and such-like as officers. There
was frantic confusion about money matters;
the persons who have charge of the fund sub-
scribed by the public didn’t see their way to part
with the precious coin for along time, and Sydney
was pervaded by penniless, accepted Bushmen
who couldn’t get a copper to go on with. There
was the other muddle by which men were ex-
amined and accepted at country towns, and gave
up their billets or sold off their properties and
came down to Sydney to “join”—only to
find that the Contingent was full and that
they had been accepted by mistake. But
the last muddle and disgrace of all is that the
inflated persons who are disbursing other people’s
money over this business reserve to themselves the
right to throw out, without any explanation, men
who have passed all tests satisfactorily and been
accepted. It doesn’t only reserve the right to re-
ject men who got in through personation in the
riding and shooting tests —these men are presum-
ably discharged with a very sufficient reason given
—but to throw out anybody and everybody, and
to do it without stating any reason. One man re-
cently ejected had given away to friends and
relatives nearly £2OO worth of property because
he couldn’t take it with him, and he had neither
time nor facilities for selling it except at a great
loss. He gave away, in fact, nearly all his worldly
belongings in his misguided enthusiasm for shoot-
ing at complete strangers in Africa. And he is
by no means a solitary case. The men who are
“ fired ” without visible reason seem to be mostly
alike in one respect —they are real bushmen who
have made disrespectful comments on the manage-
ment of the alleged bushmen who run the show. It
seems to be a case of men who can ride and shoot
getting the “ run ” for making remarks about the
unspeakable system which has filled the ranks
with men who can’t shoot and who can only fall
off. The great initial mistake lay in allowing any
private persons to play at raising troops. The
Government is the only institution which should
be allowed to raise troops. However badly it may
do it private enterprise does it a vast deal worse.

Seven Days Shalt Thou Labor—
And do all that thy master requires of thee—at his
price. This is the new Commandment which the
Seakable Victorian House of 48 Rich Land-
proposed to embody in the Tramways Amend-
ing Bill. After the Assembly had passed a mea-
sure providing for a week’s work of 48 hours, with
payment at time-and-a-ouarter beyond that limit
up to GO hours, the stolid Four Dozen shelved it
by postponing the matter pending inquiry. Then
the co.—apparently suffering from an unaccus-
tomed spasm of prodigality—offered to concede the
matter of overtime, at the said rate, provided it
was distinctly and concisely stated in the Bill that a
week’s work meant seven days of eight hours each.
The brassy assurance of the awful co. will be fully
perceived when its position is carefully considered.
Section G 2 of the 1833 Act states that the “ days of
labor shall be eight hours . . . but any person
may work overtime for special payment ” up to GO
houra per week. Also, managing-director Clapp
and secretary Spkigg both admitted in their evi-
dence before the Royal Commission of Enquiry
that the Act required an eight-hour day, but they
claimed a seven-day week, making 5G hours in the
week. This wa3 in face of the fact that the
old A.ct of Charles 11., of blessed memory,
prohibiting Sunday - labor, excepting works of
necessity or charity, was in force in Victoria in
’B3, and so remains to this day. The Sunday
trams can hardly be considered necessary as they
only start at 1.30 p.m., and the whole of
the charity in the case that charity which
always begins at home —is monopolised by the
directors and shareholders. Moreover, even
accepting Clapp’s statement of the case—a large
order—the co. has repeatedly broken its agree-
ment, for the Act stipulates eight hours per day
and that overtime may be worked for special pay-
ment, yet the co. compels its men to work 10
hours per day one week, and 9 hours per
week-day with G on Sunday the next.
Furthermore, it has coolly and persistently
ignored the “ special payment ” proviso; for
every trip that every employe does is paid for
at the one ordinary fixed rate, no matter whether
it be over the 48-hour or the SG-hour limit or not.
There is no such thing as “special payment” in
the tramway service. In making this extrava-
gant offer the perfidious co. said no word as to
wages, which would presumably remain as
at present; so that, practically, the men
would still be worked GO hours. The gaudy
offer amounted to an increase of wages of
£1 13s. 4d. per cent., on condition that the men
bound themselves to work seven days a week,
any week and every week, Sundays and holidays,
without rest or respite ! The House of Landlords
enthusiastically accepted the company’s proposal,
and returned the Bill to the Assembly, which
body, being in its right mind at the time,
perceived the insidious attempt to place a
seven-day-a-week law on the Statute Book and
insisted on the 48-hour clause. Thereupon Messrs.
Levi, Embling and Co. again returned the Bill
with scorn and contumely, with the 7-day clause.
The Assembly again stood to its guns and so the
Bill was lost. Which, under the circumstances,
was the bast tiling that could happen. It is better
that the men should work for a while, under pro-
test, as it were, an illegal GO hours a week, than
that the 7-day week should be legalised and the
Day of Rest abolished by Act of Parliament.

The Australian J.P.’s sympathy with crimes of
brutish violence is apparently incurable. A more
than usually remarkable case is reported from
South Melbourne. Three young fiends broke, late
at night, into tne house of an elderly man —a com-
plete stranger—stunned him with an iron bar,
knocked down his aged wife and kicked her till she
was insensible, and brutally assaulted his son. _ If
they had broken in with the apparent intention
of stealing something it would have been called
burglary, and they would probably have got five
years. If they had been found in the house after
breaking in, and had run away on discovery, with-
out showing any desire to steal anything, it would
have been assumed that they intended stealing
something, and they would almost certainly have
got two years. If they had been found in the
house—having got in without any visible break-
age—they would at least have been a case of
“illegally on the premises”; and that, as a
possible offence against property, is worth three
months any day. But there was an extenuating
circumstance in their case. They had nearly mur-
dered two aged people out of sheer brutality.
And in consideration of this redeeming feature
they were let off for burgling a house, for smash-
ing property, and for being illegally on the
premises, and two of them were fined £5
each for plain assault, while the third was
ordered to pay £l. Also there was £1 2s.
cost. J’s.P. Thistleth waite and Smith,
who sat on the bench, went out of their way to
denounce the assault as “most brutal and unpro-
voked.” Yet the three get far less punishment
for breaking into a house at night and committing
three fiendish assaults than they would be liable
to for breaking into a house at night and not
assaulting anybody. The assault is actually, in
the view of the dreadful Australian J.P., a virtue
which helps to counterbalance the offence of
breaking in.

Evex the once-democratic Adelaide Quiz has got
hold of the stupid Tory catchword of the moment.
It lias doubts about the loyalty of Basedow, M.P.,
and says:—
This is a serious accusation against a member of the
Legislature who dram money for his services from the
Queen he indirectly reviles..
And yet the Queen never gave Basedow or any
other politician a penny for liis services ; it is the
Australian taxpayer from whom they draw their
money. And everybody knows she never
gave them a penny. And the Queen isn’t
such an inflated fool as to say that she pays
Basedow or any other politician or public
servant. Also, the lie and grovel does her
no good ; probably it doesn’t even please her.
But it makes a lot of sensible people feel disgusted
at their grovelsome fellow-creatures, and some of
the disgust that is felt for the Tory idolator
reacts on his idol. The unmanly grovel of the
Tory crowd is the real cause of “disloyalty.”
The Queen is herself an unobjectionable
and harmless personage ; it is the people who
abase themselves before her who are objectionable.
The only way to keep a large section of the com-
munity from unmanly abasement is to remove
what it grovels to, and that is the chief reason why
republicanism exists. Also, it is the chief danger
ahead of royalty. Some day sensible “ loyalists ”
will have to consider the necessity for suppressing
extreme loyalists for their disloyalty, on the
ground that their intense worship and degradation
makes a very large number of people feel sick, and
thus indirectly undermines the Throne.

A N.S.W. teacher’s letter to Sydney Evening
News (13/2/’00):
Sir.—Can you inform me what is to be done with the
Public School Teachers’ Patriotic Fund ? If the men for
whose relatives the fund is being raised return safe and
sound, is the money to be returned to the teachers by
whom it was donated? I ask this, as I know some
teachers who, if they died to-morrow, could not leave £1
a week to their wives or little ones. Teachers are com-
pelled by the departmental authorities to pay into this
fund. I was speaking to a teacher, who has an invalid
wife and six children, and he has to pay rent and for the
service of a help in his home. For such a man to be
compelled to contribute to the Patriotic Fund means that
he is simply robbing his family by paying monthly dona-
tions, so that the families of the men in South Africa can
have U a week, while his own wife and children could not
have tl a week if he cannot leave it to them. These
women for whom the fund is being raised have free
quarters, and their husbands’ pay. Teachers are as loyal
as any other branch of the community, and are willin'*- to
donate to the best of their means. But why should
teachers be coerced any more than any other body of citi-
zens f Mr. Perry tells them that he will receive any
communication, anonymous or otherwise, of their loyalty
or their disloyalty ! The I.ynb Ministry is passing some
good measures, but acts like those 6f Mr. Perry blast
them in their infancy. It is a monstrous and iniquitous
piece of coercion on a body of free and loyal citizens
Yours, etc., ONE OF THEM.
When N.S.W. Parliament meets it would be
highly advisable to appoint some Judge of the
bupreme Court as a commission to ascertain
exactly what measures were used by the Cow-
Shaking Government to raise money among its
employes for the Patriotic Fund. The prospec-
tive widow of the Australian who is killed in
Africa is already one of the best-provided-for
widows in Australia (unless somebody embezzles
the fund), and if the Cow-Shaking crowd has been
m any way coercing ill-paid employes to stint their
wivesandchildren, and further diminish thealready
scanty provision which they can make for their
own prospective widows, in order to further ex-
pand the Fund, this striking evidence of patriot-
ism ought to lie made known. Also, if the teachers
in Minister Perry's department have been prac-
tically forced to contribute out of their small
salaries,-it ought to lie made known that Minister
PthillY has contributed an equally large proportion
of bis big one. How much was Mr. Perky’s own
donation ?
Tiie Victorian House of 48 Rich Landlords was
in reasonably good throwing-out condition in
the latter days of the session. Victoria’s House of
Landlords is the boss tlirower-out of Australia,
and the democratic bills that have been sent up by
the Assembly fly out of its front door like rain when
it gets into good working order. Higo ins’s clause
in the Land Bill giving the Government power to
compulsorily repurchase large estates for closer
settlement was cut out and rejected, and the
Tramways Bill flowout bodily. Yet even the stodgy
Vic. Council moves. It is approving now of things
that it shuddered at ten or twenty years ago; it will
approve tenor twenty years hence of things it shud-
ders at now. Its business is to waste time, to be 20
years behind the age, to be a cowardly totterer on
the brink, and to make the Assembly pass a
measure six times before its slow intellect under-
stands it. But in the long bitter end it admits
over each measure that it has been the usual
ignorant backward kind of ass for 20 years or so,
and does what it has refused to do for over lialf-a-
lifetime, and then proceeds to block the next thing.
“ Zip ” complains :
One of the most foolish practices in connection with
the contingents is that of putting non-riding volunteers
in amounted troop. It is a cruelly obvious fact that an
awful percentage of those forming the mounted corps of
all the provinces have done all the riding they ever did
in camp, and they came there as innocent of horseman-
ship as a dead policeman. Yet these men are gaily in-
cluded in a force that has to depend entirely on its
horsemanship for its efficiency and usefulness. The
Imperialist johnnies are wondering in a hazy sort of way
why it is that Australia has not been extensively used as
a recruiting ground for light mounted infantry, and they
prophecy that, in the near future, this class of troops will
be largely recruited from here. But their specula-
tion and prophesy would be squashed beyond recognition
if they were afforded a glimpse of the ordinary
flying Gilpin at riding exercise. To see an embryo
Roberts on a charger with his concertina trousers
divorced from his socks by several inches of calf, holding
manfully on to one rein and the crupper, and with a
fierce determination to sacrifice every inch of skin to the
saddle rather than fall off, is a sight guaranteed to
remove the aforesaid haziness. Putting this well-
meant apparition on a horse is simply adding in a
criminal manner to his chances of becoming food for a
Boer bullet, because a rifle is an entirely superfluous
article when all his energies and most of his available
arms and legs are occupied in frantically retaining his
seat on a bumping quadruped.

“ The war is causing a fierce war here,” writes
The Bulletin’s London correspondent, “and the
result, thank the gods of all creeds and races, will
surely be the reconstructing out of sight, and
memory even, of the fungi-grown, senilely-
doddering War-office—the red-tapeworm of Bri-
tish Government offices. Its maxim has been
during this campaign (1) conceal reverses, (2) tell
a portion well sub-edited, (3) and lie about the
rest. ’Tis certainly a blind ill-managed parent
that Australia is backing up with her men and
money, and even the most patriotic here are so
utterly disgusted that they do not know whom of
those in authority to rend first. Meanwhile the
theatres have slumped like dust before a ‘ brick-
fielder.’ The Savoy, Cecil, Carlton and other big
cafes and hotels are practically empty. The halls
with programmes full of patriotic numbers, are
trying to keep one hair on top of a depressed bead
above water; and the whole feminine world is knit-
ting soldiers’ night-caps and socks what time hus-
bands and others eat half-cooked meals to the tune
of * The Absent-Minded Beggar.’ ”

It apparently never occurs to Westralian Premier
Forkkst and his owner, Hackett, that while
their anti-Federal policy and their policy of
refusing anything like adequate Parliamentary
representation are driving the goldfields on to
desperate efforts at separation, they are them-
selves fooling with nothing less than absolute ruin.
A favorite theory of the anti-Federal party is that
the goldfields can’t separate, because, if they did,
the new province would be a province without an
adequate water-supply anywhere within its
borders. But, even then, its position would be
vastly better than the old province from which it
separated. Water can generally be found some-
where ; money, as a rule, can be found nowhere.
Such a vast proportion of Westralia’s borrowed
money has been, spent on works in the older parts
of W.A. that, if separation took place and the
debt was divided, the bit of W.A. that was left
would be utterly ruined. The revenue would
mostly go with the goldfields. The trade would
mostly go to new ports, and leave Perth and Fre-
mantle deserted. Perth would decay again to its
old status as an overgrown village mooning drearily
by the Swan River. The mint would be deserted.
The railways, of the old province would cease to
pay. Bunbury would perish, or nearly so.
Foil rest’s property and the bricks and mortar
of brother Alice would slump hideously. The
old Westralia would bo left with a huge debt and
practically no revenue. It would be the most
utterly ruined province in Australasia, if not the
most utterly ruined State in the Southern hemi-
sphere, with less resources than it had in the days
before gold was discovered, and about four times
more liabilities. Compared to its difficulties in
the way of finding money, the difficulties of the
new Westralia in the way of finding water would
be nothing, or less than nothing. The Forrest
crowd, in persistently kicking its only real asset,
the goldfields, is fooling with the worst kind of
ruin that ever threatened an Australian province.
And it does it gladly, cheerfully, out of pure blind
cussedness, with the fatuousness of that class
which rushes in where angels fear to tread, and
the happy smile of the drunk who smokes on 9
barrel of gunpowder.

“Trilby” replaced “ Tess ” at Sydney
Royal last Saturday, owing, the programme says,
to circumstances which make the occasion an
extremely interesting one to playgoers. As there
is nothing in the performance about the Bush-
men’s Contingent this remark is less understand-
able than it might be. Trilby is the girl we are
all getting: used to who appears in Act I. fur-
nished with that necessary equipment for a
modem heroine a Past. Tess’s Past being
only a skimpy little affair she is repudiated
a good deal on all sides, but Trilby’s personal
charms being of a wider scope she has four
or five persons offering respectful marriage to
her ; likewise Little Billee, who is almost another
person. Which is a lesson to the rising woman to
go in for the thing properly as only a woman with
a good strong Past is capable of any Future. The
Girl With a Past is becoming so commonplace a
feature of modern drama that this scribe sees the
time approaching when the dramatist who intro-
duces a neroine without one will be hailed as a
brilliant and original genius, and people will dis-
cuss in newspapers whether Girls Without Pasts
are really like that and can possibly be as interest-
ing and agreeable as they are depicted on the
stage. Trilby, chewing bread and sausage and
waving white feet in the air, is a more natural
kind of character than Tess, but she is set in less
natural surroundings. Her picture-frame is a
certain atmosphere of virtuous immorality and
chaste vice peculiar to the Latin Quarter —as
known to fiction. The Latin Quarter as known in
real life is said to be a good deal more sordid.
* * • *
Most of the characters are mentioned in
the programme as first-timers, which probably
accounts for the joyous freshness of the grisette
dance in Act II. —the sort of dance which makes
young skittish maidens of 40 long to break from
the decorous d.c. and join in the furore. Tyrone
Power has the glittering eye and the dirt and the
sardonic laugh and the tree-top hair of Svengali all
right. His complexion boasts the waxy whiteness
of the girl who eats chalk to make herself look
nice; the girl you read about in those solemn
little pamplilets which tell girls not to do things
which they never dreamt of doing, but proceed to
do after they have been told not to. The villain-
ous laugh of Svengali is different from the villain-
ous laugh of Alec D’Urberville : the actor who can
sport several varieties of villainous laugh has a
great future just in front of him. Also, Tyrone P.
Svengali has a certain baleful vigor which makes
him really impressive. Miss Edith Crane gets
curiously away from the Trilby likeness in the last
acts, when she wears a white silk dress of such
length that she walks up and down it several
times after she has been reproved by Small Bill.
For the rest, she is realistic, and sports two nice
feet, and finally dies pleasantly by slow upheavals
on to her drawing-room sofa. If she had lived she
would have had to marry Little Billee. So she
died.
* • » •
Mr. Atholwbod, as Gecko, sends a distinct
wave of pathos across the footlights, and Cecil
Ward gives a neat representation of the stage
Frenchman who breaks out into “Tra-la-la” on
small provocation. Trilby’s voice—which is, this
time, Miss Maud Dalrymple—is a nice enough
organ, but when one considers that a woman who
could anyway represent the voice the Svengalised
Trilby is supposed to possess, wouldn’t be letting
it out eight times per night as the mere accessory
to a medium drama, there is a fair argument for
dropping the song out altogether, and letting it
be as inaudible as the songs of the other singers.
They perpetrate unheard music, and why Trilby
should be audible while they are not is a thing
wrapped in gloom. Besides the voice, this paper
advocates the heaving out of Little Billee. There
has never been a satisfactory Billee. The audi-
ence refuses to take Trilby’s fiancee seriously. In
fact, he is a character so difficult that there is
probably only one man in the world who can
play him really well, and that man hasn’t been
found yet. But The Bulletin would like to see
George Rignold try the part.
** * *
Her Majesty’s (Sydney) is closed this week
but there is to be a great re-opening on Saturday.
On that occasion the oft-going-to-depart George
Rignold appears once more in a farewell season of
“ Henry V.” with Misses Linda Raymond and
Emily Hughes, also Howard Vernon, George
Laun, and other favorite artists, in the cast.
* * * -#
At Sydney Lyceum the management con-
tinues to put the right man rightfully into prison,
after which he retrieves the past by finding a
large and yellow nugget, which is so obviously on
the surface of the ground all the time that the
wonder is no one ever found it before. The sort
of nugget which lies about in this casual fashion is
liable to grave suspicion, as the nugget of real life
is of a more retiring disposition, and requires
a liberal amount of digging. There is this
reliable difference between the real and the drama-
tic heap of gold: the stage heap is there, and
the real one, as a rule, isn’t. The hero, besides
his easy find, is likewise to be congratulated on
having imported a large-size American log hut
into his Australian settlement. Why an Austra-
lian should build his hut on an American plan is
another mystery. Charles Reade’s story is
usually remembered by reason of an unclerical
clergyman, who tries the pi-isoner’s punishments
to see if they are bearable or not, and beguiles the
prisoner in the Dark Room by conversation
through the key-hole; but to an Australian
audience the play depends largely on the mopoke,
and the laughing jackass, and the large yellow
nugget aforesaid. These and various other details
will probably keep it going for some time yet.
** * *
At Sydney Criterion, Miss Rochester is
doing good work with a full, rich voice, and Phil.
Goer takes the place of Irving Sayles. The
Caddam Woods revels benefit by the change.
Charles Seel, the man with the loose jaw, seems
looser in the jaw than ever now. The Macarte
Sisters show great physical strength and molar
endurance, but the memory of the three pretty
Keziahs is still fresh, and the audience doesn’t
enthuse over the square-built sistern as it might
otherwise do.
** * m
The gentleman who makes more or less
lightning changes at the Criterion Theatre is as
toothless as a three-weeks’ child. Rumor says
that Ludwig voluntarily gave up a fine set of
teeth in order to facilitate change of facial expres-
sion. He also possesses a glittering glass eye, but
it is not stated whether that also was assumed in
the cause of his art, after the manner of the classic
philosopher who blinded himself in order to think
better. By the way, the Criterion audience is
getting quite mild in its loyalty. On Thursday
night, last week, it didn’t favor Ludwig’s Kruger
with a single hiss, while, at his representation of
Queen Victoria, only a fourth of the audience
tumbled to their feet, and half of these pretended
they got up to look for their hats or admire the
view. It was a pacific audience ; however, it hit
Harry Rickards with a penny after he had told it
not to, so that is something.
*# * *
“Briton and Boer,” adapted in some
places from Rider Haggard’s “Jess,” and partly
made up of recent war journalism and popular
British theories of cause and effect in Krugerland,
has come to fill a want at Melbourne Alexandra.
Seriously speaking, the one-sided want that Dam-
pier’s hotch-potch supplies is a deplorable develop-
ment of “ patriotism.” Audience ought to hunger
for truth and justice in stage dealings with the
Boer question—but they don’t. Moreover, they
would not recognise the truth if it were put before
them by a Dutchman or an archangel; nor is there
a Dutchman (or Britisher) living who could write
an unprejudiced drama on the question aforesaid.
Consequently, Dampier’s topical fiction, in five
acts and numerous discharges of firearms, is a
pardonable outrage committed from respectable
business motives. It will pay for its powder and
smoke, anyhow.
* * • •
The Boers at the Unlock include an abbre-
viated Paul Kruger, and a perky little Cronje—
Black Cronje on the bill—who makes himself
absurdly unpleasant, but often gets belted for his
pains. Also, there is a gory Boer-villain engaged
in capturing the enemy when the enemy is not
taking him prisoner, and the great ambition of
this sanguinary battler is to carry Jess’s younger
sister by storm. Meanwhile, Dam pier stutters
amidst the mystery in the kliarki character of a
sublime Bwitish idiot engaged to a widow
in the ambulance department, and when
lie discovwers that the lady is not suffer-
wing from a cork leg he loves her all the inoah,
doneherknuw. Somehow the war in South Africa
gets tangled up with the escape of Jess and her
Anglo-Australian brother-in-law-elect, owing to an
unnatural rising of the Tugela River at the insti-
gation of General Joubert, whereupon the wicked-
est of the Boer spies is shot by mistake, and the
relict, who hasn’t a cork leg, smites Cronje’s nose
with a rolling-pin. The last act but one was not
over before 11 o’clock on Saturday, so the adven-
tures of Jess and her sister’s young man have
probably been curtailed. As a matter of fact,
Jess makes the war go slower than one cou!d
wish. She seems to hamper the British advance on
Pretoria and delay the arrival of the Victorian
contingent, which is the signal for the Boer forces
to surrender. All the same, the gallery-patriots
are content to overlook the gloomy heroine for the
sake of British valor and the tumultuous foolish-
ness of proceedings in general. They feel that
they are getting full value for cash. Miss Lily
Dampier, who makes a rather startling re-appear-
ance as a plump, matronly Jess, is vaguely under-
stood to sacrifice her affections in the interests of
sister Rose. Mrs. D. is the widow with two
genuine legs, and Alfred Rolfe, F. Appleton, and
John Forde are frequently busy during the cam-
paign. Oom Ned Holloway perpetrates a pass-
able caricature of Kruger down to the waist, and
young Howard Smith is a clever-spirited libel on
Cronje. Also George Buller, as a Kaffir who
swears weird vengeance on his Boer boss, deserves
favorable mention in The Bulletin’s despatches.
* * *
Mrs. Andrews, interesting little advocate

Athenaeum Hall on Monday (26th). Mrs. A. has
been keeping dark for quite a long time. It seems
years since she discussed Paul Dombey, William
Sikes and co. on the same platform, and got the
sweetest of notices for her highly-respectable

Widow O’Brien, alias J. F. Sheridan, a
woman with a well-known Australian past, will
resume her old place in the rocking-chair at Melb.
Royal next Saturday. Sheridan disguised as a
man has been only a moderate success, and the
departure of “ The New Barmaid ” on Friday will
not agitate Melbourne to any extent. The frigid
respectability of the young person who sells drinks
across the bar is disappointing to a city which had
reckoned on getting a tow-haired Tottie of doubt-
ful character and alcoholic tendencies. As a
novice at the business, she is not altogether untrue
to nature, but the public would prefer a well-
seasoned siren, with a bright mechanical wink in
her other eye. An unsophisticated barmaid is
merely a sad mistake that soon profits by experi-
ence, and in comparison with her older and
tougher self she is not worth staging.

“ Little Red Riding Hood,” as mentioned
last week, is to appear at the Princess’s on Satur-
day (24th) under Williamsonian management.
Very few weeks back J. C. Williamson took a long
farewell of his old home, but Melbourne will feel
none the less glad to see his big show because it
was not expected. And the fact that it has been
running since Xmas in Sydney amounts to an
ample apology for the pantomime being late.

The latest news at the Bijou is last nights
of Tom Costello and G. W. Hunter. The creaky
raconteur in the blue trousers will racont
for the last time on Friday, says the advt., in
which case his little illustration of King Solomon’s
wisdom will probably be appropriated by the
nearest nigger-comedian. Costello is to withdraw
himself next Tuesday, or thereabouts, so somebody
will, no doubt, come along in the meantime to
keep the programme in good average condition.
The Transvaal War pictures have come out clearer
since the first night, and the unpleasantness of
getting wounded and bandaged for the country of
one’s alleged ancestors, is now shown with con-
siderable effect on the screen.
“ Quex ” : Poor Lambie was so eager to
get on the warpath that refusal of his services
would have broken him up. The papers will pro-
bably find it necessary to impress upon their men
the necessity for self-preservation. A war-re-
porter’s first duty is to furnish “ copy ” for his
paper, and he can’t do that when he’s dead.
“ I d(Ri’t want an editor who is a thinker,
or a writer, but one who can put commonplace
ideas in pompous language.”— Proprietor. “To
begin at the beginning is not a good maxim in
journalism.”— Smalley. “ A journalist is a man
who prints ink on paper.”— Bismarck. “Journal-
ism is good if you can get out of it soon enough.”

The Royal Agricultural Society of N.S.W.
is goiim to have a glorious show this year; and
Sec. W ebster has already grown several inches in
the chest through adequately describing the im-
mensity and splendor of the attractions he offers.
And the least thing that this country can do is to
gratefully attend in a body and pay, pay, pay
every day, for 10 days, at the gates ; or grab some
of the £4OOO to be given away in prizes. Cham-
pion horses and cattle will receive splendid prizes;
and the harmless but necessary pig, fowl, and dog
will receive the ribbons and medals where deserv-
ing. Also a wood-chopping contest is down for
those who believe in Gladstone’s motto—an axe at
any price.*
It’s sickening to hear the whoop now for
Tommy Atkins : he’s a hero, a little tin god. But
in the piping time of peace no respectable English-
man would be seen in his company. The finger of
every loafer is pointed at him as the fellow too lazy
to work. In his own country, pubs openly refuse
to serve him, and won’t allow him about the place
lest he, being an infected animal, should drive away
trade. Eating houses ditto. Certain parts of the
theatre are barred him. No respectable girl, if she
wishes to keep her place, dare be seen with him ; if
she marry him she is disgraced—far better to have
married a sweep. His pay barely keeps him, and
if he has the cheek to marry, his wife must work
(wash or char) to keep herself. And when this
war is over he will again be the pariah and moral
leper he was after every other war. The thin red
line is a fine thing in poetry, but in real life when
no war is on, the average Englishman wouldn't
touch it with a long pole.
Sydney Daily Telegraph’s San Francisco
correspondent writes that the South African war
occupies first place in American public attention
and that—
English Conservatives are deceiving themselves as to
the sentiments ot the American people. Undoubtedly in
circles close to the Administration, for special reasons,
and among the financial element, whose interests are
closely affected by the events in the Transvaal, sympathy
is felt with the British Government. There, however,
such sentiments cease. The resistance opposed by the
Boers has aroused the latent feeling in favor of the Repub-
licans, until it is now dominant throughout the country.
Within the last week the subject has come up in Congress,
and two resolutions—one antagonistic to Great Britain,
and the other favorable to the Boer cause—have
been adopted. Senator Hale, of Maine, was the author
of one of these resolutions, and, in supporting the second,
made a speech which has attracted general attention
throughout the States. Hale took direct issue with
Secretary Balfour that the South African war had knit
together every branch of the English-speaking race. “ I
deny, sir,” declared Hale, with great feeling, “ that the
American section of that race is in sympathy with Great
Britain in the South African war to stamp oiit the liberty
of a people. I deny that the American people are to be
tied to the chariot-wheels of war against the South
African Republics. And when the leader of the
Conservatives in the House of Commons asserts
that he should he met by some disclaimer from
this side of the Atlantic.” Hale, who had asserted his
belief that the war being waged by Great Britain was the
most fatal blow that had been struck at human liberty
in this century, went further than to deny American
sympathy with the war on the Transvaal, placing its
entire responsibility on Joseph Chamberlain and his re-
puted interested backers. “ I do not believe,” said
Senator Hale in conclusion, “ that the English people are
in favor of this war. I believe that the great Queen, on
bended knees, has prayed that the war might be averted.
I do not believe that the great Premier of England favored
the war. It was the act and movement of a sharp Cabinet
Minister, engaged with gold speculators, who favored the
war.” A pro-Boer meeting of large proportions was held in
Washington, at which many men prominent in the nation
were active or passive participators.
The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Owing to Absent-Minded Beggary and other
things several provinces are in desperate need of money
just now, and Maoriland has also sold £300,000 worth of
4 per cent. Treasury bills with a two years* currency in
London. But the strange thing is that Maoriland realised
£IOO 7s. 6d. per £IOO, whereas, for exactly similar securi-
ties with the same currency, New South Wales only got
£99 10s. and Westralia£9B. So either Maoriland managed
things much better or else the London market estimates
that \\ estralia’s credit is good enough to borrow at £5 per
cent., N.S.W.’s at £4 ss. 3d., and Maoriland’s—the best of
all—at about £3 16s. 3d. Yet Maoriland is evidently also
afflicted with the idea that the local investor is a poor,
mean, common animal who shouldn’t expect to get as
much interest on his money as the English one. When
the Maorilander has money to invest, the Government is
willing to sell him Consols bearing 3.1 per cent, interest,
and even of those it won’t sell more than £250,000 worth
in any one year. But when it wanted to raise money at
4 per cent, to aid the Bank of New Zealand it put the
loan on the London market, and now that it has a security
bringing in £3 16s. 3d. per cent, to dispose of that also
goes to London. The idea of letting the local outcast
have a chance to buj' the high-interest-bearing securities
never occurs to the Seddon Government. And it never
seems to occur to any other Government, either. In S.A.
Harassed Holder is offering 3 per cent, for 12 months
loans, and that weary local preacher man couldn’t get
them in London under 4 per cent.

At the half-yearly meeting of the Queensland
National Bank, recently held in Brisbane, it was men-
tioned that next July or thereabouts the first repayment
of 6d. in the £ is to be made to private reconstructed
depositors. This won’t reduce the visible liability to
private depositors as shown in the balance-sheet; it is in
reduction of the ss. in the £ which was nominally written
off the old reconstructed private deposits to make the
accounts look a little more like square, but which is
to be repaid out of profits—the liability which isn’t put
among the liabilities in the balance-sheet, in consequence
of which the liabilities in the balance-sheet are not the
real liabilities or anything like them. It was also men-
tioned that the directors had voted on their own responsi-
bility £250 of the money which the widows of some
rained shareholders are in such need of to help the widows
of Queenslanders who may be killed shooting at perfect
strangers in South Africa. They didn’t deduct this from
their own fees apparently. And there was a small row
about London proxies. The London proxies, it seems,
are cabled out in cypher to the directors. They are not
submitted, like other proxies, to the scrutineers before
they are used in the election of directors, that the scruti-
neers may guarantee that they are all right. No under-
standable reason is assigned for the refusal to let them be
inspected. And these more or less concealed proxies ap-
parently make it possible for the directors, in almost
every case, to re-elect the retiring directors and appoint
the auditors and run the whole show on their own.
Which is a solemn state of things for an y depressed or
low-spirited or suspicious shareholder to think over. The
directors, of course, believe that there is no reason why
anyone should suspect their management of being in-
capable. Which is true. There was also no reason to
suspect the last management of being incapable till it was
too late.

The Sydney lan* 1 -dealing co. of Richardson and
Wrench, which sells j our house for you if it is at all sale-
able, reports a half-year’s profit to 31st December, 1899,
of £2071. A dividend at the rate of 5 per cent, per an-
num amounts to £ISOO ; another £SOO is written off good-
will, and the remaining £7l, added to £343 previously on
hand, leaves £4L4 to carry forward. When this concern
was floated into a company in 1889 with a capital of
£OO,OOO, all paid-up, almost its only visible asset was the
goodwill of the great land-dealing business carried on by
the old private firm of Richardson and Wrench. This ac-
counted for £57,5u0 of the £OO,OOO. It has now been re-
duced to £51,900, so £SOOO has been written off in 10J
years. As the paper asset diminishes and the visible
assets correspondingly increase (the co. has now £11,715)
accumulated cash), Richardson and Wrench, Limited,
should be an improving concern, unless something very
bad and unexpected happens to the land and house deal-
ing business.

A little insurance concern, not much known
outside the circle of its own business, is the Australasian
Plate-Glass Insurance Cos., (head office, Melbourne). The
paid-up capital is £SOOO, and there is a reserve-fund of
£2OOO, the result of 31 years careful and unobtrusive busi-
ness. For 1899 the receipts (including £372 from interest
on investments) were £2768. Losses were £745 and
expenses £IOOS, leaving a profit of £lOlB, equal to over 20
per cent, on the paid-up capital. The usual dividend of 8
per cent, is declared, absorbing £4OO. Altogether a solid
and prosperous little company.

It is only necessary to read the reports to learn
what horrible cats the Victorian London-owned mines are.
Should London pull out no better with the Deep Lead
Mines —the Victoria Estates, etc. —it will soon be impos-
sible to float a Victorian mine in London, and the sooner it
becomes impossible the better. An enormous amount of
money is being spent on these alluvial properties in pump-
ing and other plant. The London and Globe Finance Co.
(Whittaker Wright’s concern) has taken a hand in them,
but even its failures are more numerous than its suc-
cesses. N.S.W. is very little better ; Myalls United is
working at a loss. Gallymont is a fairly good thing for
the tributors, but has been a terrible disappointment to
the co. Gibraltar, although turning out about a thousand
ounces a month, is making no money. The Wentworth
Mines seem to have pretty well petered out. There are a
number of others which never were any good from the
start, and are still in that unsatisfactory condition ; why
they continue working is a mystery.

Of £loo,ooo—and £1.112 brought forward makes IS,-36
available. Very few concerns in the precarious, wool,
cow, and pastoral property business can show returns
even distantly approaching this nowadays. A dividend
of 8 per cent, absorbs £BOO3 ; £4OOO is written off the
valuation of the co.’s freehold property, which makes a
total writing-down of £26,014, and reduces the paper
value of the property to £153,500; £2500 is added to
reserve fund, making it £60,000 ; and £4236 is carried
forward. This concern paid 10 per cent, from its incep-
tion in 1882 to 1885 ; 6 per cent, from 18S6 to 1804 ; 7 per
cent, in 1595, and 8 per cent, since then. The chief visible
reason for this prosperity and the absence of the usual
reconstruction troubles is that Harrison, Jones, and Dev-
lin had no debenture-holders to reconstruct; it does a
small and highly profitable business on its own capital
instead of a large and ruinous one with a million or two of
borrowed money. Its chief drawback seems to be that it
started with ail immense mortgage on its premises—as
late as 1593 this liability stood at £IIO,OOO ; and though it
has since been reduced out of profits to £87,000 it is a
healthy mortgage even now. And another curious feature
is the paper asset “Goodwill £40,000.” Certainly there
is a reserve-fund of £60,000 to set against it, but why the
co. doesn’t write off the foolish paper asset, and call its
reserve-fund £20,000, which it really is, passes under-
standing. Goodwill as an asset is one of the most unsatis-
factory things in business. A company seldom wants to
sell it till it is winding up, and the only time this asset is
really wanted it isn’t there.
* * • ■*
The Carlton Brewery (Melbourne) showed a
profit for 1899 of £15,524 —equal to the splendid return of
almost 60 per cent, on the written-down capital of about
£27,000. The last three years’ profits have been :
1897 £3550 1899 £15,524
IS9B £5646
This is dating from the time when the Carlton had its
great cleaning-up. Since then the improvement has
been very rapid, and the almost-lost institution has been
rapidly getting on its feet again. The trouble ahead is
that the Carlton owes some £785,389 to debenture-holders
and mortgagees ; the debentures, which are the largest
part of this huge debt, mature in 1902 ; and the
co., by reason of the enormous depreciation in
the boom-burst days, hasn’t anything like £500,000
worth of assets just now. If the debenture-holders want
their money in 1902 it is dead certain they can't get it. If
they are content to renew for 29 years or so, anil take the
interest regularly in the interim, it is almost dead certain
that they will get their money. The accumulated profits
and the probable recovery in the value of the big co.’s
great mass of depreciated public-houses would put things
right by then, or some years later, or sometime. So far,
however, the debenture holders have proved themselves a
hard case to deal with.
The Carlton Brewery Co.’s present terribly top-
heavy position is as follows :
Liabilities. Assets.
Capital, paid-up .. £27.072 Cash, Plant, I’roper-
Debentures .. 680,084 ties, kc £458,716
Mortgages.. .. 104,705 Shortage .. .. 386,581
Sundry Debts .. 32,836
£845,297 £845.297
The co. makes its shortage much less on paper bv insert-
ing a paper asset— “ Goodwill, £150,000,” but. Ihe good-
will of a concern which is in such st raits is a thing about
which the less said the better. The real shortage is
£386,581. A year ago it was £402.105, and two years ago
it was about £408,000, so there is a steady and very
material improvement. If the co's creditors give it time it
can evidently work off the deficit by degrees ami pay
everybody, if they don’t give it time, and there is an
immediate realisation, they will prohahh get about 10s.
in the £, and they will lose much more than the share-
holders. whose capital is nearly ail lost already. It is
certainly a rather curious situation for a brewery which
is earning the splendid profit of nearly 60 per cent, to be
thus tottering on the verge of utter bankruptcy.
M ‘Cracken’s City Brewery (Melbourne) which
12 months ago was beginning to look a little better, has
put up tlie second-worst year in its very bad record. The
losses for 1889 were £23,904, which compare with some
previous t ears thus :
1891 Profit £45,711 1896 less £35.874
1892 „ 30,345 1897 Profit 1.002
1893 Loss 4,600 1898 Loss 9.158
1894 „ 10.406 1899 „ 23,904
1895 „ 22.923
(Melbourne Age, by the way. in one of its wilder moments,
called the loss £40,216). The figures are certainly bad
enough, though even they might be worse. The gross
profits were £61,477, and ordinary working expenses were
£62,581, so ends would very nearly have met had it not
been for the heavy burden of £22,500 forinterest at 4.) per
cent, on £500.000 of debentures. This debt was incurred
in 1888, when the concern was floated into a company
twice as large as the business warranted, if M’t'rai ken’s
had remained just the same humble concern it was it
would have been a paying affair even in most of the
recent bad years. Or if the shareholders had put up
£500,000 more capital instead of burdening themselves
with a huge liability which must be met in good times or
bad, their brewery would have paid its way and given a
small dividend occasionally, with a prospect of improve-
ment later on.
After ’9(5 it was decided to have a general clean-
ing-up, and £250,000 —half the paid -up capital—was
written off to provide for bad debts, losses, and deprecia-
tion. Since then another loss of £32,060 Itas accumu-
lated. The only apparent hope lies in paying off some of
the debentures, overdrafts and mortgages—4J per cent,
debenture-interest is a hopeless burden t hese times, and
presumably the overdraft and mortgages are at an even
heavier rate—.so the call of £250,000 has been made with
another call of £250,000 in prospective. The first call of
£250,000 has so far produced rather less than £BO,OOO. and
quite possibly it will not yield much more. A more or
less reliable Melbourne paper talks of the next call of
£250,000 yielding£so,ooo in all. There has also been talk
of raising £40,000 by an issue of preference shares, lint
the trouble is that all these devices are quite insufficient.
They aren’t likely to produce over £250,000, and over
£660,000 is wanted. The balance-sheet can be compressed
as follows:
Liabilities. Assets.
Capital paid ..£329.365 Cash in Trust Ac. £72,006
Sundry debts .. 26.422 Various assets
Overdraft .. .. 49,972 alleged value .. 017,409
Debentures and In- Shortage .. .. 32,060
terest .. .. 6Q5.625
Mortgages.. .. 99.096
Other ad vances .. 10,095
£1,021,475 £1,021,476
If the co. could find £665,688 and wipe off all these
mortgages and other borrowings it would probably have a
very good and profitable brewery left, but the uncalled-
capital was never more than £500,000 and the attempts
to collect £259,000 of that have panned out as above. Or
if the co. could persuade its £665,688 worth of creditors
to take the brewery and business and call things square it
would be a blessed relief.

sheep got his tail singed in the sunset, was the accumula-
tion of the last 10,000 years or so, and it has already been
eaten out. And now it is goat country pure and simple
unless some squatter likes to stock up with salamanders.
Is the salamander saleable just now .

Chairman Griffiths, at the half-yearly meeting
in Adelaide of Eleanora Gold and Antimony Mining Go.
(Hillgrove, N.S.W.), stated that: “ The operations of the
co. for the half-year showed a loss, owing mainly to the
yield of gold not being sufficiently high.” 00. ‘ gone to
the bad £2OOO 10,192 tons crushed for only 29390 z. gold
giving £10,418. Total yield from all sources £13,007.
Victory Forest Reef G.M. Cos. is a cruel disap-
pointment to scrippers. Stock bought some time ago for

“ Passed through splendid wash but does not prospect

Mt. David (X.S.W.): For the year, 5448 tons,
2987 0 z., value £11,577. No divs.; but directors have con-
fidence that the returns will improve. They always have.
In this case, they have it in face of the fact that the
returns have been steadily going down.

During its life of a little over 20 years the
Bendigo branch of the Miners’ Association has returned
to its members £39,794 in accident pay; £10,384 has gone
to the widows and children of members who have died
from injuries received in mines ; and strikes have ab-
sorbed only £7988. A great part of the last-mentioned
has been in respect of troubles outside the district.
Star of the East (Sebastopol, Vic.) which paid
its last dividend, if writer remembers aright, in March
’95, now makes its 123rd call (3d.). Also it is reported :
“ Stone somewhat below the average.” Yet the average
has been low enough of late.

There is trouble brewing around the well-
boomed Waverley (N.Q.) tin-mines. Companies only
employing enough men to hold ground. No sinking
is being done, for an obvious and rather painful reason :
the lodes apparently don’t go down, and what there is on
the surface has been much overestimated both as regards
quality and quantity. Locally it is commonly believed
that the machinery will never be erected, and the bottom
must drop out of the show soon. Writer knows the
ground ever since the prospectors found it, years ago, and
barring a few rich surface patches, there never was any-
thing to warrant large expenditure, especially as the in-
credible roughness of the country and the out-of-the-way
position of the mines makes working extremely costly.
For instance, carriage front nearest railway-station £8 per
ton ; only water about 800 feet below mines in a creek ;
no grass for miles around (even now in the wet), and no
timber handy. Hene Tekel 1 Also Upharsin 1 Likewise

Latest Q. gold rush is 25 miles south of
Coen, and C'oeti is somewhere up Cape York Penin-
sula. Specimens vary from 2ozs. to 1000 alleged-
very much alleged. Find supposed to be identical with
“ Lead Man's Secret.” for which various parties have been
searching for the last eight years. Name arose, or said to
arise, thus: A sick miner reached Cook town Hospital in
the moderately long ago, and in return for wardsman’s
kindness showed latter swag of rich specimens and
endeavored to draw a map of the locality, but died before
he could finish it. Since then hundreds have wandered
after the Eldorado. Hamilton, M.L.A. for the district,
was one of them. The present find is probably no relation
to the Secret, for Queensland is a large hot place, and
strange myths grow there as well as alligators.

Federation Cos., Croydon, a Bull concern, is now

petent management. Local Mining News consistently
condemned manner of working, and was, as usual, con-
demned in turn for “ trying to injure the field.” At
length. London directors sent an experienced mining
manager from the Towers, to inspect and report. Result:
Discovery that nearly £6OOO had been wasted, co. £2OOO
in debt, and only alternative liquidation.

which a co., formed by E. H. T. Plant, of Charters Towers,
are putting down a deep shaft. Also, diamond drill is
being put down by a private syndicate to test Rand’s

This will be a great test time for Croydon.

Lvall Tharsis : “There is now a great deal of rich
bornite throughout the ore body, including a seam 2ft. in
thickness, similar to the famous ore worked in the North
Mt. Lyoll. It has the appearance of increasing in size as
depth is attained.” The same old wheeze. Suppose the
seam was 4ft. below, and they were rising on it, would the
public hear anything about the diminishing appearance?

Mt. Lvell last month treated 23,051 tons of ore.
The average copper value was only 2’49 per cent; silyer
2'63 ; gold '099. This lower grade copper the manager
attributes to the fact that the systematic working of the
excavations required the extension of the open cuts to-
wards the north end of the ore bodies where the ore is of
lower grade than the average. Since then it is alleged the
grade has risen. It is plain to anyone looking at the Mt.
Lyell huge deposit that the ore lying against the hematite
body is much heyond the average value. It is in the
immediate vicinity of this hematite body that the richer
sulphides are worked and the gold and silver contents are
also greater. A portion of the hematite is also worked
for its gold contents.

Dundas (Tas.) is a good example of the
“busted” mining town. When the West Coast had
its silver boom a few years back Dundas was exploited,
the badgers shooed out of their holes, pubs, built, and
things tvere “locomotive.” The trifling fact that the
mines produced no silver didn’t matter —at boom time.
But the boom went the way of all booms, and Dundas
slumped. Now it is a place where the few inhabitants
make a living by borrowing a pick and shovel to look at a
lode. Its streets are thickly peopled with goats and the
used-up horses of Zeehnn. Now and again a horse dies in
the main street, whereupon all the male portion of the
population who happen to be awake hitch ropes on to the
carcase and drag it to the nearest abandoned shaft.

From this it would seem that the returns given to
the shareholders were accurate until April. But
in May it would seem that the shareholders began
to be systematically informed that the mine had
yielded vastly more gold than it had really produced.
This went on till August, by which time the shares had
gone up from £lB to £2B 10s., and the shareholders had
been apparently informed of the production of 4U,0000z.
more gold than were really produced. Surely there must
be some explanation of this 1

Great Boulder South. From the story told in
London at the general meeting last month by Zeb l>ane,
this co. has found some small gold-hearing veins in (he

The Financial Times (London) attributes the
great collapse in Westralians to the want of highly cap-
able mining managers and metallurgists, such as the big
mines of the Rand have long commanded, heavy taxa-
tion, severe railway rates, and incompetent control in
London, which control had always more regard to the
market than to the mines. Lovely to read this after the
slobbering encomiums passed on Kalgoorlie managers and
metallurgists when things were booming beyond their
worth.
The Sulphide Reduction new process claims
to have solved the sulphide problem in a practi-
cal way' and heyond all dispute. The Ashcroft
people did likewise, but found a terrible fly in the
ointment after wasting about £500,000. The new process
has treated a consignment of Mt. Reid ore, base because
of a high percentage of zinc. It will be remembered in
sorrow and anger that the same thing was claimed to
have been done in England by Ashcroft with a large con-
signment of Broken Hill sulphides. Anyhow, this com-
pany is selling its rights like hot cakes, and it is now
proposed to am ilgamate with the French co. with a
capital of £500,000, which will be turned into £1,000,0 )0
when occasion warrants. Shares are selling at a premium,
and everyone went away from the meeting in London
recently with the assurance that the sulphide problem
was absolutely solved at last.

H. C. Callahan, general manager of the Lake
View Consols and consulting engineer to the Ivanhoe
Gold Corporation, arrived in Sydney by the Moana on
Sunday and is now on his way to Kalgoorlie. It now
transpires that he took a San Francisco steamer to Hono-
lulu intending there to pick up the Canadian Pacific
steamer, but on its arrival it refused to take on any
passengers in consequence of the plague. 11. C. C. had
then to return to ’Frisco and put in quarantine-time
with the result that instead of being ori the’field at the
end of December, he cannot get there till the end of
February. During his enforced and unexplained absence
all sorts of y'arns have been spread about him, including
one that he was not likely to return at all. All on
account of the slump in the share-market, for which the
manager, under any circumstances, is always made re-
sponsible, so far as that great asinine public is concerned.
Lake Views fell in two or three months from £26 to £ll,
They'have, during the last few weeks, risen from £ll to
£ls, and should they rise another £5 Callahan will again
be encircled with a halo of public admiration.

“The earliest information” complaint by Aus-

London directors of several W.A. mines be in possession

the facts are allowed to leak out in Sydney, Melbourne,

their manipulation of the markets before we know the

Since the London Critic, Hess’s paper, changed
to a purely financial journal, its most distinguishing
feature is the “ Directory of Guinea Pigs.” Up to date it
has pilloried over 200 and given the details of over 2000
cats which they directed, and so far in alphabetical order
only the letter G has been reached. The list is already
out in book form, and when the alphabet is complete the
volume will be as big as a family Bible, while its informa-
tion should be invaluable. The writer can imagine
thousands of people looking up the Directory' of Guinea
Pigs when names are emblazoned on prospectuses.
Concerning recent remarks that miners have an
idea—“ superstition ” somebody calls it—that accidents
are most common underground in the early morning.
Where there is a night shift they certainly' are. It is
doubtful, though, whether atmospheric changes have
anything to do with them, though that is what many miners
ascribe them to. The cause, more likely, is in Diemen them-
selves. In summer especially the miner who lives in a
galvanised iron humpy, with seven youngsters crying
most of the time, only sleeps in patches ; and if he isn’t
bright in the early morning when he ought to be asleep
(and it’s a pretty drowsy atmosphere in the 1000ft. stopes)
it is no miracle. Yet the miner who can’t keep bright
while working among “ soapy-heads ” or running faces is
pretty sure to be taken out some morning in sections.
Mayor Billson, of Albury (N.S.W.) de-
siring another year in the chair, took the occasion
of the aldermanic election the other day to obtain
what may be called a mayoral referendum. The
names of the three would-be mayors were submitted
to a vote of the ratepayers, Billson heading the
poll with an almost 2 to 1 majority. This is the
first time such a referendum has been held in
N.S.W. ; the law makes no provision for it and
the result binds no one. But, as Billson says :
“Such an expression of the ratepayers’ opinion
will powerfully hint to the aldermen whom they
should elect.” Once more—why not let the rate-
payers elect the mayor ? In many country towns
the ratepayers have very little rational amuse-
ment, and it is a sin to deny them the harmless
joy of electing their own Billson. All mayors
should bp named Billson.

SOCIETY
A wealthy Australian merchant and pillar
of the Y.M.C.A. recently received much ap-
plause for a magnificent donation to the
war fund. Simultaneously the wages of the poor
women making coats in his big factory were re-
duced from 2/1 to 1/9 per coat. Despite all efforts
the philanthropist could only be induced to com-
promise at 1/10, and the sweated unfortunates have
resumed work to make good the amount (and more)
of that “munificent donation.”

IN THE AGE OF THE NEW WOMAN.
1ST NEW MAX: “My dear, who is that extra-
ordinary creature on the sofa talking to

2ND NEW MAN: “Oh! a recent arrival. He's a
bundle of affectations, too athletic, rational, and
all that. Quite too dreadfully effeminate for

One Q. contingenter had curious luck.
The Commandant had decided that married
men with more than two children should
not be allowed to go to the war. When the would-
be soldier of the Queen left home he was the father
of only two children. He was duly accepted and
passed all the tests. On the morning of em-
barkation he received a telegram from Ins wife to
the effect that he was the father of three
children, and therefore his trip was off. The
authorities had also been apprised of the increase,
and just before the troops fell in the happy but
enraged father was called aside by the officer and
informed that he must be discharged.
A feeling has arisen in Melbourne that the
Post Office clock is tainted with disloyal opinions.
That implement plays a large assortment of tunes
including' “Gorsave,” “Rule Britannia,” “Home
Sweet Home,” “ Last Rose of Summer,” &c. The
jingo crowd is pleased with “Gorsave” and
“Rule Britannia,” but it wants the other music
expelled to make room for “ Soldiers of the
Queen,” “Sons of the Sea,” the dreadful jagged
lilt of the “ A.-M.-Beggar,” and the other weary
horrors that shriek in the music halls in these loud
days of gore and foolishness. And if this matter
isn’t attended to there may be trouble, for P.M.G.
Watt is the responsible man, and Watt voted
against the first contingent, and only painted him-
self bright red when he got a portfolio. Therefore
Watt is subject to suspicion, and needs to sing
the “ A.-M.-Beggar” at least every hour to clear
his character.

The Australian small boy improves. A
nine-year-old, whose parents are on the land near
Colac (Victoria), packed his handkerchief and
went off to join the Bushmen’s Contingent the
other day. Subsequently his irate sire pursued
him through the bush on a horse, whereupon the
youngster took to the hills, and made for a gully
impassable to a horseman. The father dismounted,
tied up his nag, and continued the chase; but
again the rising generation was too many for him.
The kiddy doubled on the pursuer, and, securing
the horse, rode off, and was not heard of for
several days. When the dear child was discovered
he had sold the horse at Panmure, and with the
proceeds was painting the town red as high up as
he could reach by standing on a chair. He was
arrested for horse-stealing (the father had bor-
rowed the nag in the first place), and when last
heard from young hopeful was out on bail, and
the proudest kid in all Christendom.

A fair proportion of the Vic. Bushman’s

justify their inclusion, but the acceptance of about
a quarter of the men in it is a howling farce. The

Some of the so-called evidence collected
by the Creswell-Tichborne Commission is the
merest foolishness. For example, Mrs. Bridget
Wines, widow, stated that in 18G9
she was courted by a sort of a
foreigner who bore “most, if not
all, of the marks” which
the eal Sir Roger had
concealed about his person,
and who told her lie was
si nobleman’s son, having
run away to sea from Stony-
hurst College when he was
14, after which he visited
Valparaiso, and was aboard
the Bella when the (un-
authenticated) mutiny oc-
curred, &c., &e. The real
Roger Tichbome never
saw Stony hurst till he was
17, neither did he ever run
away to sea. He started to
travel for the benefit of his
aristocratic health at the
age of 24, and next year lie
booked a passage by the
Bella, bound for New Fork,
and the Lord knows what
happened to the Bella. And as
for real Roger’s alleged tattoo
marks, it is quite probable that tlie
Ticlibome family witnesses invented them for the
purpose of confounding the impostor Orton at the
famous trial. Other witnesses swore they had
never seen, nor heard of, such marks.

“ C.M.G.” : Was in the baths at South
Melbourne the other day when a sixteen-stone
citizen taking aquatic exercise in the hope of
reducing his wilful waist suddenly lost his
equilibrium, and began to roll about in the water
like a barrel. He was too fat to sink had he had
sense enough to keep his head shut, but he com-
menced the usual absurd effort to drink the bay,
and was fast drowning when a perky boy of about
eight years seized on him and began to haul
towards the steps, looking for all the world like a
sugar-ant pulling an omnibus. Then three or four
men went in, and the job was taken off the
youngster’s hands. The stout one was taken out,
and pressed and drained. Presently he sat up
and began to take notice, and then interest was
diverted from him to the amazing urchin, who was
sitting near, mother-naked, and snivelling miser-
ably. “What’s the matter, my lad ?” asked one
of the rescue party. “Ye dirty lot o’ sneaks 1 ”
wailed the little hero, “ what id yer take him from
me for when I was gettin’ along orl right ? P’r’aps
he’d’a’gi’me a bob.” Even the very small boy
knows the average size of a stout man’s gratitude.
Rockhampton (Q.) Record published two
telegrams side by side, the other day, from the
little ink-spot town of Barcaldine. One was to
the effect that the local Patriotic Fund had
reached £l5O. The other stated that the local
hospital, which last year treated 1289 patients, had
been so much neglected of late that the total
funds were only £B. It is the same everywhere.
The money subscribed to the Patriotic Fund is
mostly robbed from charities, and the real
widow who is with us now is deprived of her little
dole to keep the possible prospective contingent
widow, who is already about the best-provided-for
kind of widow in Australia.
The perennial National Guard case has
been re-opened in a Sydney Police Court by old
George Republican Dibbs summoning ex-full-and-
complete private Byrne for neglecting to give up
trappings valued at £5 odd after having been sum-
marily discharged. Byrne says he wasn’t lawfully
discharged according to the muddled Volunteer
Act of the province, and he refuses to give up the
property until he is so discharged. He has now
been fined ss. “ with the option,” his objections
being over-ruled by the Stipendiary. The case
turns on G. Dibbs’s right, or want of right, to
summarily and verbally dismiss a N.S.W. soldier
without bringing him before the commandant on
some definite charge of “misconduct,” and giving
him a chance to answer it. The question, in
short, is whether the National Guard belongs to
the man who publicly cursed the Commonwealth
Bill or to the people of N.S. W., who have paid for
its arms, its belts, and its finery? Stipendiary
Mair says, in effect, that it belongs to the eminent
Bill-curser.

The usual leper was unearthed the other
day in a Queensland sugar port. Not that that
matters much. In the same town seven or eight
supposed lepers “ batch ” in some dens down a
by-street. They are only “supposed,” because
they allow no one in their hovels, and they only
come out in a soft, noiseless way on moonless
nights, and no Government official calls round to
inspect. The rent is thrown out of the window—
how it is earned no one knows, but it is thrown
out right enough.

The Melb. tram-conductor, when he got a
living wage, kept himself clean and neat. Now
his uniform consists mainly of long hair, dirty
linen, and patches. The other day several ladies
of uncertain age got a severe shock when a con-
ductor walked the car with a considerable-sized
flag of distress flying from a rent in his exhausted
pants. If the bosses won’t pay a living wage,
then for shame’s sake they might supply their
employes with a large bag apiece to wear over
their other clo tlies.

A divorce-court audience has no soul to
appreciate true heroism in a respondent. At
Melbourne last week, the mother of eight children
applied for severance of the marriage-tie on the
ground that her husband, after 20 years of
domestic happiness—as happiness goes—had left
her for a much newer girl. And the fickle fugitive’s
letters to his wife were read in court. He told her
she had always been a good woman, and he still
loved her, in the sense that he looked forward to
meeting her in Heaven—where marriage doesn’t
count. But he also loved his new girl Kate, and
intended to stick to her, because she was otherwise
friendless and alone, and all that sort of thing.
A lot of laughter,” “loud laughter,” and “con-
tinued merriment ” greeted the reading of these
honest epistles. Here was a man who could give up
a good woman and eigh t children in response to a
natural desire, and write “Dearest wife, —Get it
through as fast as you can and as cheap as you
can, and the court roared as though he were a
low comedian saying “Damn it!” Orthodox

There comes a fairer moment, dear;
How does this climax strike you ?
Clasp hand in mine ; I stand, not kneel,
With « My true friend, I like you.”

MY IDEAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the sunlight Alters through
Dim green branches, I remind me
When the pain is all behind me
And Life’s splendid gift was—You.
When at night the moonlight streaming
Steeped our hearts in Love’s young dreaming
W r hen your eyes on me were beaming
Doubts were few.
When the curlew’s plaintive song
Came to warn that Life had sorrow,
What to me meant Love’s to-morrow,
W r hat to me that Love was wrong.
Thro’ the boughs the wind was sighing,
Sadder came the curlews crying,
We but knew Time’s wings were dying—
Youth is strong.
What to me that grief is real,
What to me that she has left me,
What to me joy is bereft me.
Now I know I could not steal
All that made her worth the winning.
I could not have loved her—sinning.
Slowly round God's wheel is spinning
My Ideal.

A thrilling shark incident happened last
week at Coogee (Sydney). The fish was dozing
peacefully in about 4ft. of water when a lady
bather took a header and landed on his back.
They were both surprised. A screaming female
whirled her wet white limbs up on the rocks, and
an alarmed fish got up steam and put out to sea.

MISTRESS (engaging cook): “ What is your objection to sleeping on the ground-
floor?"
C OOK: “ Well, I’ve always been used to a decent bed, and I ain’t going to sleep on no
floor for nobody!”
Court case at Ballarat, last week, who had appa-
rently seduced and abandoned a young woman
after deluding her by a mock marriage, was
characterised by Judge A’Beokett as “ utterly un-
worthy of belief and an absolute liar.” Next day
a horse which had apparently heard of the case
kicked him so violently on the leg that he had to
be taken to the hospital, a very much damaged
ndividual.
Baron Brassey was the only Victorian
Governor who didn’t sign official documents.
“Uncle Tom’s” hand grew so unsteady from
hitting the ground when he fell off things that he
had a rubber-stamp made, so that one good punch
would accomplish the desired effect. Even with
this assistance, many of the papers on which le
Government of the country hinges bear the
stamped signature at all angles. A few even pre-
sent it upside-down, and there are one or two rare
documents where the signature occurs in the
middle of the verbiage, and trails m a long wavy
smudge, extending thence to the proper spot.
“ Uncle Tom ” was a bad shot, and if he had been
bombarding a town instead of a document he
would never have hit anything, save the hospital
now and then.

The society of good people who poke their
noses into things is again on the war-path in Mel-
bourne. In couples the good, long-nosed people
scour the gardens and parks in the dusk, and just
as ’Arry is telling his Mary Han what a regular
devil he is, two pairs of gig-lamps are fixed on him
and a voice like a rat-tail file says : Young
people, will you take a tract ? ” Unless driven off
the kopje there and then, they deliver a lecture
with an unwholesome moral, snort a bit, and glide
away. The substance of the tract in general is the
Bad Man, the Once-Virtuous Girl, and the Baby.
Every week these gig-lamps report progress to a
company of other hard-faced people with similar
green spectacles, and tell the Horrid Things they
have seen. Then all the thin, hard-faced people
rise up and polish their green spectacles with a
trembling hand, and say how glad they are that
they are pure and virtuous, and not like the un-
couth but comparatively harmless ’Arry—who,
after all, was only telling Mary Han a fairy tale of
valor about an alleged person that he licked in Col-
lingwood. * * •

On Mrs. Sydney Burdekin’s grounds on
the Hawkesbury was celebrated, the other day, the
98th anniversary of Ebenezer, the oldest Presby-
terian church in N.S.W.—in fact, in Australia.
Ebenezer was the first church of any denomina-
tion in Australia built wholly by voluntary sub
scriptions. It is still in good repair, and promises
to last another century.

“ both to Bai-

dently even

the dredge they always win, unless it is
a very young and frisky dredge. However,
things are better than they were, for the apple-
shaped boat, which was reputed to be 28 years
old, was sold lately. The writer has a vague idea
that it fetched over £lOO.
Launceston (Tas.) Examiner tells a story
about a Tasmanian J.P. who, hearing that a
certain inhabitant wasn’t quite convinced about
the justice of the Transvaal war, paid a, local
ruffian a sovereign to assault him, and promised to
acquit the ruffian immediately if the case came into
court. It may possibly be true. The Tasmanian
J.P. does many remarkable things, and public
opinion is so brutalised and debased just now by
jingo violence that the average jingo paper would
applaud a little thing like that.

What ought to have been a strong tragic
situation was spoiled the other day by bad stage
management. A young Sydney woman and her
husband had quarrelled and separated. She grew
despondent over the matter. One day she got
into a cab and told the driver to take her to her
old home, and when he got there to call her hus-
band out. Then she took poison, and if she had
taken the right kind of poison, and other things
had fitted in, her dead face would have stared at
her husband when he put his live one into the cab,
and it would have been a notable episode. But,
after the manner of her kind, she speculated in
carbolic acid, and her cries in the cab made the
driver abandon all previous arrangements and
drive furiously to the hospital, where the patient
died. And even if she had gone home her hus-
band wasn’t in at the time so they wouldn’t have
stared at each other across the cab door after all.
This is the true story of the prize absent-
minded man of a south Sydney suburb. Many pre-
vious instances of mental abstraction are charged
against him, but the latest is a record. About five
weeks ago his wife died, yet the other night a be-
lated neighbour, who takes the same size in hiccup
as Blank, was surprised to see that gentleman
stealing in at his own gate in the small hours and
crawling cautiously on the verandah. There he
removed his boots, imploring himself at intervals
to keep quiet. Then lie opened the door with the
loud and clumsy caution of a belated bear, left it
open, crawled upstairs dropping his boots all oyer
the place and calling out to himself to keep quiet
and not waken the wife, fell down once or twice,
set fire to his tall hat at a gas jet, and vanished
with intense care into the bedroom. He had for-
gotten that his wife was dead.
* * « *
Even now it is very seldom that a week
passes without a rumor going round Queensland
that “important discoveries” have been made in
the matter of the Gatton murders. Nothing ever
is discovered, but the good old rumor totters per -
sistently on the mental horizon, and even at this
late date strangers occasionally go into the fatal
paddock and stare at the grass, as if they expected
the earth to open and a clue to rise, like Lazarus
from the dead.
A case of just retribution was witnessed
the other day at Manly, near Sydney. A young
lady and a young man were strolling towards the
boat. They were both affluent-looking ; the lady in
particular was a curled and bangled darling with a
great mass of soft, fluffy brown hair. The sun
lingered in these brown tresses, and the girl
looked like a daughter of the gods. Behind them
a stout, middle-aged, motherly-looking woman
was trotting, also boat wards, with a large parcel.
Just as she caught up to the pair the girl’s glorious
mass of brown hair fell off and bounced on the
pavement. The girl strolled on unconscious, with
a short, scanty tail sticking out underneath her
hat—only that and nothing more. The motherly
one picked up the hair, concealed it in her cloak
and ranged alongside. In her kind-hearted way
she meant returning it surreptitiously, so as not to
shame the owner by drawing her companion’s
attention, but the girl blighted her before
she had whispered two words: “I don’t know
you,” she said, haughtily; “Please, do not in-
trude.” The motherly one still tried to speak.
“ Really,” said the bangled one, cutting her short,
“You are a most intrusive and obnoxious person.
George, this woman is begging or something.
Send her away.” Then the old lady blazed up
and threw opippunction to the winds, and held

out the mass of curls publicly at arm’s length. “ I
was not begging,” she said, in a voice that rang
half-way down the Corso; “I only desired to
RETURN YOUR LOST BACK-HAIR. HERE IS YOUR
hair.” George turned ghastly as his eye fell on
the skimpy tail at the back of his best girl’s head,
and then at the mass of brown tresses in her hand.
It was evident that an illusion had vanished.
After waiting a few seconds he spoke in hard
tones: “I think, Julia,” he said, “that you for-
got to thank this lady for her kindness in return-
ing your back-hair.” And Julia, with the hair in
her hand, said something in a broken voice—
possibly to the effect that she wished the old lady
was dead.
TWO MELODIES!
Brisbane.
Two melodies my lady plays,
Though one ye never hear ;
The first she strikes from yonder lute
In silver notes and clear ;
The other comes from tender string*
That tremble at her will ;
And I— I know whose bosom throb*
To bursting when they thrill.
Such magic in her music lies,
Such deep impassioned call,
That both her songs are blent as one
To hold us here in thrall ;
With one she sways the list’ning throng
That lingers gently near,
And me she bends beneath the spell
Of one ye never hear 1

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She wax the Ball-room Belle,
said all —
And there reeve many there
to see —
At that Vice-regal festival
Of grace and chivalry.
The men admired her, young and old ,
And wise and foolish, fresh and stale;
But she was as an iceberg cold,
And as an iceberg pale.
With scornful glance and queenly air,
She gazed upon the glowing scene,
As if a queen indeed she were
Arid men her subjects mean.
One man alone of all the throng
Kept far aloof from her the while ;
And, as she proudly swept away,
Surveyed her with a smile.
Had he wdh hopeless love gone mad?
Or was his cynicism forced?
Not so—not nearly so; they had
Been married—and divorced.
And so, while conquests marked her
track,
He merely smiled to think that she
Had two large warts upon her back
And was bandy in one knee.
CREEVE ROE.
A MAN’S FORGIVENESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You ask me to forgive you, sweet,
You kiss me through a mist of tears,
While even now the bitter words
Ring in my ears.
Do I forget the yielding mouth
Can utter words with serpent’s sting.
The dear wet eyes look scorn and hate
And misery bring.
Ah, clinging lips 1 ah, loving eyes !
Of course I kiss away your tears,
While all the time the bitter words
Ring in my ears.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, February 20, 1900.
Mr Dear Mvee, —
At the Bushmen s racos on Friday Society ro-
gathored amicably after a long absence. In the
V R lx>x MrsDarley and .Mrs. Mackenzie sat
side by side like two big sisters, in dark blue
foulards figured in white ; and the Misses Darley
shivered m white drill suits and black hats The
newest bride, Mrs. Stanley Kyrie (w. e Miss Maud
Mackenzie), was the brightest figure of the Acting-
V. R. set, in hergoing-away suitof navy doth with
sailor collar of pale blue, and big black hat with a
touch of blue among the feathers. Among other
dressers, I noticed many pretty country girls who
scored heavily by knowing the Mush Contingent
better than the town girl ; Mrs. MaoArtlmr Ons-
low, a tall figure in white-flowered silk with aeorn-
flower sash and the big black hat without which
we are nothing ; pretty Miss Maggie Cox, in a
striped black-and-white tailor-made ; Miss Inez
Bensusan, in a red toque and short jacket and
blue-and-white skirt ; Mayoress Harris, in a novel
cream-laco jacket over a black frock.
Women showed an inclination to break through
conventionalities and hug the gentlemen in kliarki
without an introduction. Several women who
believed they were being carried away by patriot-
ism cornered some of the best-looking busbies.
1 heir conversations always opened with, “ Are
you glad you’re going to the war ? ” The Bushies
looked as if they thought they were. This question
is put to them by every second woman who visits
the camp, and is apt to bring oil that tired
feeling.
A useful little worker for the Absent-Minded
Cause has been Dorothy Vane. She sang very
nearly £3OO out of local pockets through the Pan-
tomime season. In town on Saturday morning
she was looking quite done-up in a paio-grev suit
and sailor-hat. In one way, at any rate, she is
one ot the least disappointing actresses going, for
she has only been out of tlio bill twice in upwards
ot two years opera.
, I TORfl sQme verses somewhere the other dav
about Those Who Stay At Home.” Charming
verses, insinuating that those who stav behind
have just as grievous fighting to do. That’s easy
to understand But it’s hard to distinguish
between the rights of those who cut and kill for
England s sake away in the Transvaal, and those
who stay at home to do it. Two men in Victoria
quarre led over the war last week, and one killed
the other. A carer home, a little son of Colonel
Maul, of Soudan distinction, fought for the British
in the back-yard last week, and blew his eye out
with a tiny cannon. All the little boys at
Longueville are much affected by the story but
whother they won’t go and try to do likewise is a
little doubtful.
The dangers of being a patriot < Or should I
saybeing a Mayor ? lam a little hazy on the
subject myself. In Maori land lately a local
Mayor was speaking at a patriotic meeting. “And
the widders and h’orphans.” he said. “Think of
the widders and h’orphans.” A little further on
And all those widders and fatherless h’or-
phans, cropped up again. His next breathing
space was broken with another touching hurst
about the fatherless children and the poor, un-
provided-for widders.” As everybody feels sorry
for widders and h’orphans, that meeting would
have been quite ready to share the Mayor’s dis-
tress only that all the Contingent alluded to were
unmarried men.
After the tremendous inroad the Patriotic Fund
has made on people’s pockets it will not be sur-
prising if local charities find themselves without a
blanket this winter. Already they are beginning
to agitate. The first to move the wind is St. Yin-
cent’s Hospital ball, always a popular hop. A
preliminary meeting will be hold at the Hospital,
Darlmghurst, next Thursday, 22nd instant, at
11a.m.
I hear Sydney is going to have the Hopes per-
manently. Lady I rancis has been house-hunting
all over the place for the last week. She says
Sydney suits her. Rumor says she is goiit" to
appear here professionally before very lon*'. °At
any rate she and her husband have taken°a fur-
nished house at Potts Point for the winter.
Another pretty new-comer is the second Miss
Moss-Davis, from Maoriland, who married the
second Mr. Moss from Sydney. She has just
arrived among us in all her bridedom and is raisin"
a vast deal of admiration.
Speaking of Maoriland, Rolf Boldrewood's
pretty witty daughter, Miss Vera Browne, has
just become engaged over there to an Kmriishinan
named W. H. Peach. Mrs. and Miss Browne
were doing the baths at Rotorua, met Mr. Peach on
their travels and the engagement happened very
speedily. “ Robbery Under Arms 1 ” Special
edition, for home consumption only.
I hear that a society engagement—between a
gilded eligible and a pretty, dark-eyed belle—
broken off a year ago, has just been mended
up and set going again as smartly as ever. Also,
a good many people will be interested to know
that an engagement is announced between Mr.
]S ugent Robertson, well-known as a writer and a
heaver of huge wedges of protest against mediocre
play-actmg, and Miss Mercy Murray, a graduate
of Sydney University with a decided gift for
elocution.
It is alleged that Lord Hopetoun is likely to be
Federal Governor, and Victorian women are pro-
testing that if they had known Federation would
mean Lady Hopetoun coming amongst them again
they would have fought against the great union.
The lady was unpopularity personified and her
husband’s hardest work was trying to atone for his
wife’s undisguised contempt for tho people
amongst whom she had come very reluctantly. It
may he that site has learnt a good deal in the past
live years, for she never had a London season till
she quitted Victoria. She was a verv raw
Governoress. It was as a “freezer ” that she shone
most markedly. She would sit on the dais at
balls, alone, or with women whose chairs were
placed well out of the ice-belt, perhaps as a dis-
couragement to chat. If addressed, she would
reply with a cold smile, or a monosyllable.
Persons who attended a certain Highland ball
during the Hopetoun regime, have not forgotten
the Governor's dancing of a national dance with a
girl who was the champion dancer of the High-
land clan, lie danced with enthusiasm, snapping
his fingers and kicking high—regularly enjoving
himself. But when he went back to the dais"and
his wife, what a change came over his Beauchamp-
like face (he was then very like Little Billee).
The consort was talking in a low tone ; her fine
eyes were snapping. If she was not giving it to
Adrian Louis for “making an exhibition of him-
self,” then the onlookers were much mistaken.
He danced no more that night.
Perhaps if Lady Hopetoun had some centuries
of pedigree behind her the Victorians would liavo
stood her Vere de Vere attitude more patiently.
But ennoblement and the evolution of De Molcyns
from Mullens are incidents of this century.
“ Trilby ” at the Royal on Saturday, showed its
title clear to being called a popular play. A seeth-
ing house, crowded everywhere, gathered to
admire. It seems like last century smeo we had
a top-dressed circle. Mrs. “ Seppie ” Lew was in
pale blue against black hair—a lovely combination
with diamonds and roses about the corsage. Mrs.
Hugh Dixson was also in blue. Mr. John Storm
Kingston, who would surely have made such a de-
lightful little Billee, sat next to Mrs. Kingston, nee
Miss de Lara (sister of Isidore de Lara, the com-
poser), a brunette in a smart long grey overall
cloak, with turned-over white fur collar. Mrs.
Bethune, in black, sported a glorious diamond
necklet and pendant; and a handsome young
artist brought things back to their daily level by
walking about under a white helmet. He was
mistaken for a bush-brigader, but observed that
he was not going to the war, because he had to
stay at home and fight the rumor that ho was
going to be married.
'I he gods are all very well, in their way, but in
other people’s way they’re a nuisance. On
Saturday a restless seethe broke out as soon as
“Trilby” started. One voice called out “ Weary
V illie” in a way that made little Billee squirm,
and nearly upset Edith Crane’s gravity. When-
ever she kissed Billee, the gods kissed too. Also,
they nearly “upsplit” her death scene. At the
end they sent up a frantic appeal for Trilby, but
In Iby was too indignant to come before the
curtain.
All the caste is new except Edith Crane as
1 ruby and Jennie Brennan as Bebe. Tho former
looxed exquisitely lovely in her opera frock of
some thick white silken stuff, closely embroidered
m fine silver. Tier dying gown was of aceordeon-
pleated white silk, with loose lace sleeves that
didn t altogether hide her white unwanted arms.
1 was so glad to notice that her dreadful cough
was better, though her voice, with its charming
modulations, is still a little hard. Miss Jennie
Brennan’s pale-pink silken Bebe, the clever high-
kicker. was all too brief a part for the bouse.
Mrs. Braey made herself useful as the landlady,
but broken French isn’t her strong part. Ro"se
Musgrove, in scarlet and black, might have been
repeating her “Geisha” French girl down to tho
little red shoes.
As for the men Little Billee again demonstrated
the impossibility of a boy of Bdlee’s own age
playing that part. Mr. Victor Dougall brought a
round black bead, round blue eyes, and a “colonial ”
voice to bear on the character, but he didn't bring
with him any suggestion of a genius for drawing
met. I want to see Kingston as Little Billee.
The woman next to me said she wanted to see His
Ex.. Anyway, Edith Crane’s beauty is a big mis-
fit beude the spruce youth who looks as if he
may break out at any minute with “ Any orders
for the butcher?” And Tyrone Power takes
several coats of weirdness off Svengali as,Reuben
Fax played him. He dies more brieflv, and is
aided by a naturally strange hollow voice with a
remarkable carrying power.
Maud Dalrymple—a pupil of the gifted
Ernest Truman—is the invisible “Ben Bolt”
warbler. Her voice is a sweet contralto, but it
sounded too near, and made you think of a. sing-
ing-lesson, so studiously was the warbling clone.
Miss Regina Nagel’s lovely, touching notes were
all very well, hilt, unless the Trilby voice is really
exquisite, the best art would be to leave “ Ben
B.>lt ’’ arid those wonderful golden notes to the
imagination.
Which reminds me that one is invariably disap-
pointed when a play talks a great deal about
somebody’s wonderful beauty, or wonderful voice,
or wonderful magnetism. Svengali's marvellous
playing, for instance. Tyrone Power is only
the outside of an amateur. He runs up and down
the piano with much cleverness, certainly, but
the cleverness consists in bis cunning wav of
hiding what lie cannot do. And Napoleon!
Enter Napoleon, exit all one’s Napoleonic faiths.
If ever your youth returns to .you, Mvee, and you
break into play-writing, do write a play in which
the hero—Cromwell, for instance—never appears.
Let us hear of him, and feel him, and just miss
seeing him all the way through, blit for art’s sake,
and common sense’s sake, and sentiment’s sake,
don’t bring him on the stage. Besides, think of
all the actors you might put into such parts.
No woman can live to-day without a white lace
veil. Surely the embroidery on some of tho
fashionable ones has been suggested—as to design
—by Maori tattooing. A lady who has just
returned from Maoriland, »vturs a veil—the em-
broidery of which exactly follows the lines and
curves of tattooing on the chins and jaws of chiefs
of high rank. All the same, the veil was neither
boug.it nor made in the land of the Moa and white
Heron. It came from Paris.
Rumored that Kipling is running an involuntary
zoo of himself. Another consequence of his men-
dicant ditty. When the people round his place
have an hour and a half-crown to spare, they give
the latter to a cabby, carter, or other vehicle-man
and instruct him to drive slowly round Rudyard's
garden walls till the value of the money is ex-
hausted. The cabbies and carters down Rudyard’s
way are getting into the millionaire stage, and the
sig.it of a number of heads barely visible above the
walls slowly circling round and round, happy
when they catch the gleam of Rudyard’s spectacles
or the echo of some gentle swear-word, is said to be
a beautiful and instructive sight.
A Home authority relates as a startling fact
that Marie Corelli is insane. As Dr. Johnson
said of Hannah More, when she left the ticket,
“ very chaste, only 7s. (id.,” upon her party tur-
ban, “ very true, but who doubted it ! ”
1 have been reading a lot of books lately, and
from them all I make this deduction. The golden-
haired heroine is going out of fiction! Even
writers are beginning to know too much, and the
innocent maiden of twenty-two with the shining
yellow hair won’t wash—metaphorically speaking,
that is.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“Government Mouse (Melb.) is in the hands of
the decorators. It is being ‘done up’ for the
Governor-General. Consequently his Semi-Excel-
lency Madden plays at royalty at his private house
at St. Kilda. and occiisionally at Mount Macedon.
'i he * procesh ’ at the closing of Parliament started
front St. Kilda. to the great joy of the neighbors,
and the neighbor’s dog, and the adjacent small
boy.
“The beams of Lieut.-Guv’nor Madden at the
Patriotic Race Meeting fairly outshone the sun.
His smiles were spread lavishly like a dust-
sprinkler on a wet day. and as form’s pink button-
hole it «1 ic 1 n t leave the bonnet-blooms a chance.
Lord Dicky, being new to the Bland One’s service,
could not keep in step, and either hopped for-
ahead or slouched disconsolately behind.
His Ex. held sweet concourse with Janet Lady
Clarke under a big black umbrella, and later lie
helped to escort the lavender lady in the Club’s
\.R. luncheon cloister for afternoon tea. When
she came out. lo! a posy of blush-pink roses
nestled under her chin, They were the first oasis
in the mourning desert —the very first touch of
color the small-waisted widow had allowed herself.
By the way, the lavender gown was of foulard,
with the usual dicky arrangement of white lace
and chiffon.
“The palm fans that one sees the Naicest flut-
tering these times were ‘shaken’ from Caulfield
on the blistering Saturday (10th) of the initial
Autumn (?) meeting. Any number of the fans
had been provided by the club committee, and, as
there was no printed notice to return, everyone
spirited them homo.
“ Talking of 4 printed ’ notices. At one of last
Tuesdays Bourke-street Chiffon Shows placards
appeared on all the new frocks hearing the
museum injunction ‘ l>o not touch.’ The
fashionable firm was driven to this step by the
persistent way in which amateur needle-dodgers
fingered and turned over and sometimes tore the
flimsy creations. Now, the heads of the depart-
ments the ’aughty black-dressed dignitaries—
perform patrol duty, and anyone infringing the
order will presumably be exiled on to the outer
pavement.
“Melbourne's military mania still rages. At
the M.C.C. ground (Saturday, Feb. 17) a war-
feverish couple, whose two tiny cadet sons offici-
ated as collectors, absurdly paraded their baby boy in
regulation kharki, his halo of yellow Huff peeping
out under his martial sombrero, while rifle,
bayonet, leggings, etc., weighed down the chubby
lnulg’Bt till he niutinier] ,*mfl tiriishefl tin* campaign
in mummy’s arms. It was a perfect <!av and m..-t
people looked nice. On the track, ‘nut-brown
1 ullidge in white and crimson sash was pictur-
esque, and. as heretofore, Martin’s fair hair and
pale-blue suit went well together.
When Cor’ Save struck up. the Lieutenant-
Governor’s party proceshed deliberately to the
centre of the Oval. One good thing about the
Maddens m office ! They give you the worth of
your money. No premature hiding in the
vice-regal box, forgetful of the fact that, having
allowed themselves to be billed as draws, they're
bound to face the music.
“ Janet Lady Clarke showed up well as she
stootl talking to the new Commandant. Slim and
erect in black toque and lilac-silk frock, she was
the belle of the bunch. General Downes, with his
big, grey moustache, looked brisk and soldiorlv in
serge suit and soft hat. Some people describe
this grey-liaired grafter as a eobwebhed antique.
Anyway, he's less unwieldy, if not so handsome,
as predecessor Hulled-Smith. Even that other
much younger candidate for the ex-Chief’s shoes,
favon*(i tor family reasons by local Naicest, shows
far more symptoms of bow-window waistcoat than
Ins successful rival—the alleged ‘slippered pan-
taloon.’
“ At .the sports, the Madden and M‘Eaeham
ladies, in light toques and transparencies, looked
the worse from afar for their too-juvenile colors,
neither boasting the straight back and trim waist
of the lady of Cliveden. At close quarters, mind
you, John Madden’s liege lady has the prettiest
face of the trio, while the Mayoress holds a trump
card m her bonny yellow hair, but figure, deport-
ment, and carriage are worth more than rubies to a
society leader. Lady Brassey was a case in point.
When we knew her, the sometime Hon. Sybil de
vere Capel was worn, sallow, grey-haired, with
teeth hopelessly out of drawing. Nevertheless,
thanks to fine eyes, good clothes and a dis-
tinguished bearing, she more than held her own,
and was invariably the most elegant figure on
view no matter what local belles, fine-dressers
and high-steppers entered the lists.
“ Tile Lieut. -Governor, the Mayor, lawyer Leon
and other committeemen, frock-coated and gloved,
looked oppressively dressy, considering that the
occasion savoured of athleticism. Aide Nevill
wore, for him, an unusually effective grey suit,
which in the cold South wind gave a comfortable
buttoned-up air. The fitted back had a sliort-
waisted way with it. When tjhe boys of the old
brigade affected double-breasted, swallow-tailed,
high-waisted coats, they also sported high hats,
big enough to slip down to their ears. I daresay
we’ll live to see roomy top-pieces in vogue again.
“ Our one and only Cardinal journeyed from
Sydney to Melbourne last Friday to open the new
li.C. church at West Melbourne. At Albury H;s
Eminence changed into the sumptuous state car-
nage usually reserved for the Governor, and arrived
at Melbourne in great dignity. Luxurious refresh-
ments were sent up from Melbourne with the car-
riage by Mr. Anderson, M.L. A., so that His Red-
Hattedness should not faint by the way. And it
is pleasing to record that Patrick Francis Card,
arrived in good order and condition.
“Miss Eily O’Hara—the big, bouncing daughter
of the doctor—elected to have her marriage with
Mr. Rowan put through with very little fuss.
Only relatives were invited, and owing to the
Patriotic race-meeting commencing at the same
hour, the old ancestral families were otherwise
engaged in any case. Lady Madden and youthful
Miss Leslie represented the salt of the earth.
Miss O’Hara’s friends came forward handsomely
with cheques. ’Tis said that the Chief Justice’s ran
into three figures, and they weren’t the figures of
£1 Is. (id. either ; also the others from relatives, far
and near, totted up to a nice plump sum. The
more pious members of the Stephen clan (who
sport tno blue ribbon of denial) donated a prayer-
book and a Bible.
“ Miss May Harper, just engaged to one of the
young Taylors, of Toorak, and Euston Station
(X.S. W.) is the only daughter of the former mem-
ber for East Bourke, and the grand-daughter of
that jmmeer of Victorian Presbyterianism, the late
])r. Cairns. The latter’s wife, still intellectually
vigorous and alert, has long ceased to find any
novelty in the possession of great-grandchildren.
Old Mr. and Mrs. Harper, the bride-elect’s pater-
nal forbears, also lived to be great-grandparents,
only dying last year within a few months of one
another. The future Mrs. Taylor is tall, slight,
and still in her teens, with bright black eyes, and
small, proud, handsome face. All Dr.” Cairns’
descendants, by the way, have the knack of
marrvingand giving in marriage. Another grand-
daughter, Miss Alice Muir, is to face the ceremony
in a month or two. and an old maid is an unheard-
of thing in the connection.
“Surely, the Rev. Mr. Me Swaine of Brisbane,
who volunteers as Queensland war-chaplain is too
old for tlie billet. The kindest and, possibly, the
pluckiest of men, he must be sixty or upwards,
and plump as they make ‘em. Shaking hands
with him is just like nestling your paw into a pat
of butter, minus the grease.
“ Poor Mr. Lambie, the first Victorian killed in
the war. was a “ ladies’ man,” in the sense that
women liked him and appreciated his gentle genial
manner. There was something attractive, too, in
the pallid, wistful, old-young face and slight boyish
figure, in juvenile short jacket and incongruous
tall hat. Africa must have seemed a scrubby,
grubby spot to Lambie, for the home lie left
behind him in a Melb. suburb is a dainty nook—
a picturesque cottage mantled with creepers and
surrounded by flower-beds and home-made
ferneries,, the pet hobbies of its departed owner,
who also found time to play melodiously on the
flute.
Y ours affectionately,
GOULI-GOULI.

The commander of the Vic. Bushmen’s
Corps is Captain Dobbin. Astounding to learn that
there can be a Capt. Dobbin outside of Thackeray’s
“ Vanity Fair.” But the name seems to fit the
billet. Gee up !
By, the recent death in London of Francis
Lewis Shaw Mere wether N.S.W. Treasury bene-
fits to the extent of £9OO a year. Mr. Merewether
was N.S.W. Auditor-General for a term and car-
ried a £9OO pension into private life.
Mrs. Kruger is chiefly described as being
an over-fed and adipose virago. Nearly every
British paper has published screeds from various
lady globe-trotters describing Mrs. Kreer as the
worst-tempered and most hostile lady it had ever
been their lot to meet. Still, Mrs. Kreedjher
seems to have some gentle forethought about her,
for when President Krugger’s statue was designed
Mrs. Kri-her suggested that the top of his bronze
belltopper should be hollowed out and kept filled
with clean water for the sake of the little dicky-
birds.
Tim MTnerney, the Victorian captain,
wounded and taken prisoner at Rendsburg, South
Africa, is a solicitor in private life and a partner
of his brother, Dr. Tay Pay MTnerney, warden
of the Melb. University. He was the first to take
advantage of the Act qualifying a managing clerk
of 10 years’ standing as a solicitor. Also he has
been a more or less military character since 1890.
Tim’s capture is about the best thing that could
happen to him, for he is over 6ft. high, and built
in such proportions that any respectable Boer
marksman could kill him to a dead certainty at
lialf-a-mile.
“The German Emperor during his recent
private visit here, ” writes The Bulletin’s London
correspondent “ removed many nasty impressions
concerning his hungry desire for ‘ sending wires ’
and the moral effect he created improved the
pound-a-week city German clerk’s position fully
£1 19s. a year. William is certainly full of life
and humor, even in face of the perpetually
gloved left hand on the end of his withered
arm, and that unpleasant, actively-eruptive ear.
He is a ‘ boss ’ in the ‘ bossiest ’ meaning of the
word, and punctual as the ‘eight o’clock rush.’
But his and your punctuality are one and the same,
he waits for none and none have to wait for him.
P’raps when all is considered it is his fun which
saves him from being a consummate prig, for
wherever he is oscillating there is genuine laughter
all round. Bill speaks purer English than Albert
Edward and the ‘ th’ baulks him but intheslightest.
He shoots with his right arm only, does it well,
and carries his useless limb in a masterly, un-
obtrusive manner.”
Papua’s Bishop Stone-Wigg who, notwith-
standing considerably shattered health, plans out
further hard work among the dusky islanders,
proved himself a man of courage during his
first year in Brisbane. Brisbane’s least
respectable quarter was the property of /
the former Bishop, Tuffnell, a wealthy
old absentee who employed ex-
Premier Dickson to collect the
rent.s The Rev. Stone-Wigg
examined the Bishop’s slums
and alleys, and, after many
expressions of horror, started
a society to “convert Bishop
Tuffnell’s tenants.” As the
tenants were piebald and
cosmopolitan, he employed
kanaka missionaries, as well
as men and women of his
own color, to attack them
with prayers and brass-
bands. But most of the
tenants were hard cases,
and the work didn’t prosper.
Tuffnell died fabulously
wealthy.
Last year much was
heard all over the earth of one
Hooley, who might have dropped
out of public notice but for the
Bankruptcy Trustee. When Hoo-
ley broke, he publicly declared
that he was going to pay 20s. in
the pound, that his estate would
show a surplus of half-a-million,
and that when everybody had
been paid he was going into the
House of Commons. It now
seems that the claims against
the estate amount to over a
million-and-a-quarter, more than
double the amount estimated by
Hooley; so far the amount
realised is considerably under
£lOO,OOO. It is doubtful if the
estate will ever pay more than
3s. in the pound. If Hooley ad-
heres to his resolution to be in
the general election for next year,
it will be necessary for him to find
over £600,000 in the meantime. How
long is it since the advertising meteor pre-
sented that service of gold plate to St. Paul’s
Cathedral, for the faithful to take the Hooley
communion out of ?
Sydney journalist Cyril H. Sandham, who
last week died suddenly of heart failure, was in
several respects a remarkable man. Originally a
naval officer, and afterwards a Queensland racing-
official, Sandham—like so many men who, so to
speak, gravitate into journalism—combined great
literary versatility with a comprehensive general
knowledge, and was always relied upon by the
paper with which he was principally connected
for satisfactory copy at the shortest of notice upon
almost any subject short of Chinese metaphysics.
Slightly Mephistophelean of aspect and somewhat
cynical of philosophy, Sandham was nevertheless
at bottom essentially a man, and will be missed
by many who, like the present writer, knew him
too intimately to take the husk for the kernel.
Oscar de would seem from some
recent files to be still going strong in London on
the agricultural and pastoral outlook of Australia.
When he lived in Queensland there was no stop-
ping him on that double-barrelled theme. He was
M.L.A. for a Northern and afterwards for a
Western constituency, and the same speech ap-
peared to serve him all the time. With Morehead,
then a giddy young thing, and Lumley Hill he at
one period ambitioned the overthrow*of both
Griffith and Mcllwraith. He was the first to
extensively settle the Diamantina country and he
still owns station property out there.
“ Paradis ” : Major Macready, son of the
tragedian, is referred to in the war news from
South Africa. Macready married for the third
time very old, and sets down in his journal his
rapture at the birth of this little major. Barry
Sullivan, in Melbourne, had a Macready in his
company, under that name, said to be a son of
the tragedian, and like him in the face, but with
no talent. He only acted “John, a servant,” or
something like that, not even ascending to the
dignity of “Charles, his friend.” Barry Sullivan’s
Macready could not be accounted for in the bio-
graphy. He seemed to come from nowhere.
The economic tendency in Australia is ever
downwards. There are places in Sydney where
you can get a decent meal with wine for 9d. nowa-
days, and in accordance with this almighty
tendency the big dogs of the bar are glad to reach
out and seize even such small things as District
Court Judgeships. Twelve months ago Rogers,
Q.C., saw a vacant seat on the District Court
Bench and took it with all his might. And now
Mr. C. G. Heydon does the same thing. And
yet, there was a time when those gentlemen and
much smaller gentlemen would have met the offer
of such a position with a cry of wounded dignity.
Captain Machattie, who goes to Africa
with the Bushmen’s Contingent,, if it ever gets
away, has been 20 years practising medicine in
Bathurst, where his father also practised for 50
years. Captain Machattie was President of the
Federal Convention held in Bathurst four years
ago. It was a challenge thrown out by his father
whioh determined the bushrangers Ben Hall,
Bourke, Vane and Gilbert to raid Bathurst in the
early 60’s. This led up to the attack on Keight-
ley’s at Dunn’s Plains, on which episode was built
the myth of Mrs. Keightley’s ride for the £5OO
ransom. And out of that again grew a drama
from which Australia is not likely to recover for
many years.

Once, when Parkes was
out on a political trip, about
half a dozen cookies and
their wives and little Bill,
their offspring, also the
house - dog, as-
sembled at a
wayside station,
and cheered as
the train passed
through. “Hisup-
?ose,” remarked
arkes to a Sydney D. T. re-
porter who had been in England— ‘* Hi suppose this
is the sort of demonstration they make in Hingland
when Mr. Gladstone is passing through a town ? ”
“On a smaller scale, of course, Sir Henry,” an-
swered the indiscreet pressman. “You know
nothing habout it,” snapped the vain old man—
“nothing at all habout it!” And he never for-
gave that reporter-
C. J. Roberts, N.S.W. Leg. Councillor,
one-time Postmaster-General, but best known as
boss publican, goes to London for a season. When
in the Lower House he was a devoted Parkesite,
and often, going to a Cabinet meeting, put his
cheque-book in his pocket. As a politician he
was unobtrusive, even when Minister, and regu-
larly went asleep on the cushions of the Assembly
at 11 p.m. He was the youngest and most lavish
Mayor Sydney has had.
Dear Bulletin.— Leichhardt was a Dutch-
man or German, or something, and consequently
“ unpatriotic.” What the devil is the meaning
of this latest expedition to look for the dis-
loyal person’s bones ? If they are found I
vote that they be burned by the common
hangman. Likewise that Von Mueller’s
bones be dug up and sent away to
Europe in disgust. Also, it would be a
fair thing if the Sydney suburb which
is named after the disloyal explorer—
who doubtless went out to Cooper’s
Creek as a Boer spy—should change
its name to Victoria.—A.G.
The kanaka has a head

left him with a buzzing

Such an accident would mean certain
death to a white man, but Billy Mallicolo re-

j mas w ho died in Dunedin the

Before the union Maoriland

Dick was member for Dune-
din in ’59, and soon after be-
came a member of the little
Provincial Government, and
for some years he and Walker
and Cutten and Harris
and other forgotten
characters bustled
about a good deal
on the ant-hill of
Otago politics.
After the aboli-
tion of the pro-
vinces he drift-
ed to the larger
ant - hill at
W ellington,
and was a dry,
arid, honest,
painstaking
mediocrity in
the Hall and
Whitaker Min-
istries. After
that he drop-
ped out of
public notice.
He was a tall
thin man with
a stoop and an
intensely serious
o o u ntenance,
and when he
wasn’t in politics
he did something
for a living in a
small office in
Dunedin. Writer
never knew exactly
what it was, but
these were bad
days in Dunedin,
and almost every
alleged business
man sat mooning in
a small office by
himself, or accom-
panied by a share
of an office-boy, and
counted the flies on
the wall for a living.
Some of the
Australian Congrega-
tional people, back
from the interna-
tional conference
in Boston, tell of
meeting “ Dr.” J.
A. Dowie, formerly
of Melbourne, who now
runs a thriving faith-healing
business in the cultured city.
Dowie admits that he is making money—says he
has got well into the five figures already—and he
drives as good a pair-horse team and carriage as
his city sees. Yet Boston is supposed to be a place
of intense mental elevation, where everybody
wears spectacles, and has a forehead that bulges
out like an awning, and carries the Encyclopaedia
Britannica in 24 volumes under his arm.
“ A-theos ” puts in his little speak about
a rather unimportant person who died -lately a
long way off: —
There is another and more presentable side of the Mar-
quis of Queensberry than that which you sum up in the
words : “ One way and another Q. contrived to be a
highly disreputable personality.” He at least had the
courage of his opinions, and it was because he dared to
avow his sympathy with agnosticism by becoming the
head of a sister Freethought organisation to that of which
Charles Bradlaugh was the chief, and not because he
had been divorced (under Scotch law, by the way) from
his first wife or knew the rules of boxing, that the
hypocritical peers of Scotland refused to re-elect
him a representative peer. It is customary enough for
religious journals to make accusations against Free-
thinkers for trade purposes, but we may well look with
surprise when the stories originate in the secular press.
Though personally unacquainted with the private life of
the late Marquis, I venture to affirm the belief that the
great agnostic leaders in England would never have pre-
ferred him to the position he held had there been any
suspicions as to his character, as they well know that the
Church organisations would be only too quick to make
use of any scandal as a weapon of attack. They could find
no occasion against Bradlaugh or Ingersoll, and the fact
that they never attempted to use Queensberry’s name in
this way either is sufficient to show that they had no
evidence to go on.
Robert Colquhoun, one of the fnost despe-
rate criminals in Australia, escaped from Yatala
(S.A.) prison lately. Colquhoun was, years
ago, a prosperous Melbourne tradesman, in a
shop of his own, but be took to owning property
that didn’t belong to him, and, after a few
sentences, became one of the famous gang of safe-
breakers, headed by Williams and Montgomery.
When these two men of enterprise were hanged
at Sydney, the leadership fell to Billy O’Neill, a
big, masterful man, who successfully planned a
certain famous steal of £3OOO worth of tobacco.
The tobacco was traced, and Colquhoun completed
the chain of evidence by squealing vigorously.
O’Neill got seven years, and the informer himself
was sentenced to four years, and was told by the
J udge that his conduct only aggravated his offence.
He was, however, released within a week, and
made for W.A., where he soon got seven years for
burglary. He had served only a few months when
he broke gaol, and went to Adelaide, to fall in
with a ten-year sentence there. He had completed
about 18 months of this term when he got away.
Colquhoun is commonly supposed to be the man
who put a large consignment of bullets into the
neck of Melb. detective Me-rcer, though the charge
was never proved.

“Malle”: Came across a ghost of the
past recently in the shape of a red-shirted digger
rocking a cradle in a creek. The old boy re-
counted how he and his mate once came across a
Chinaman in the Lambing Flat locality, who had
just wound up a bucket of wash-dirt. ' They
wanted to inspect dirt, but the Chinaman elbowed
them away and said, “Nosavee.” Whereat the
mate, “ who was a bit hot-tempered,” threw the
heathen down the 40-foot shaft on top of another
yellow delver, and hove the nail-keg of dirt down
after him, and then left, leaving the rope on the
brace. “I’ve often wondered,” soliloquised the
ancient, “ how them blessed Chows got out.”

“Luck ” : Re luck of drunks and children.
Once trained a black mare for a bush publican in
north-eastern Victoria. Was absolutely the most
vicious animal I ever struck, and I didn’t strike
her often. It wasn’t safe. I was the only one
that could handle her at all, and in nine months I
got kicked twice and bitten half-a-dozen times.
Couldn’t put a horse in the next loose-box or she’d
kick the partition out. Would even kick if a
stranger came within three yards of her stall.
One day a lot of threshing-machine men got on
the spree at the pub. I left the door of the
stable open for a few moments and when
I returned, heard someone in the stable say-
ing, “Whoa (hie), ol’ gal.” Looked in, and
there was a drunk stroking her all over, and she
feeding away and taking no notice of him what-
ever. _ Told man to come out, and he came. Next
morning mare kicked me, with her usual affa-
bility, and broke two ribs. I think vicious horses
like to have beer breathed on their hind-quarters.

“ W.M.F.” : Here is something new to
me. Other evening rode to a dam to give my
horse a drink. Was surprised to see scores of
bees buzzing round wildly and helplessly on the
surface of the water. Looked for trie cause and
found each bee held down by a little black water-
beetle. When the bee is floating on the water,
drinking, up darts a water-beetle, seizes him by
the leg close to the body, and hangs on. Bee
buzzes round and round trying to get his sting to
work. Beetle knows his business and simply
hangs on till bee is drowned. Then he sets to work
to feed on as much of the bee as is not pirated by
other beetles. Similar performance to that of the
devil-devil bug, which makes a circular, funnel-
shaped hole in the sand or dust for ants to fall in,
and then hangs on indefinitely. But with the bug
his capture is private property.

•’Pelican”: Strange
that, with a long snake
experience in many
parts of Australia, I
nave never seen the
much-talked-of “back
spring.” The “fore
spring” I have seen
plenty of; snakes
simply draw them-
selves back in a suc-
cession of small “ s’s”
and when ready stiffen
the muscles, I presume,
and come out straight
in front or laterally as
they please. Have dis-
sected a large black
snake that I killed in a
swamp, and got out live
frogs which were O.K.
save that they looked a
bit dazed. Never found
any live prophets in a
snake—but I am mak-
ing a mistake. It is
the whale who is the
prophet-eater.

“ Trotter ” writes from Gunnedah
(N.S.W.)
Six dry summers, and seven months without a shower
is the order of things here. The land is as dry as a pair
of boots in Sheol. Country all around as devoid of
grass as a Sydney tram-motor. The average temperature
for the past few days have been 100 in the shade, and at
the time of writing 112. Furniture is too hot to sit down
on, and I have stood up for six days. A man on the
Plains lost 400 head of cattle in one night; they got into
a paddock of thistles which they devoured eagerly and
died. They had been eating wooden fences for weeks
previously and food broke them up. The Namoi is
practically dry, and you can hear the smell of it a mile
away. Water is undrinkable—except boiled—and the
tanks are teeming with strange beasts. You swallow 18
beasts in an average drink. A man is thirsty all day long.
Local option man Boyce ought to come up here for a
month or so, and I guess he would soon change his
opinion. Yes! they drink all right here and getting
drunk is the chief pastime. lam a nomad and par-
ticularly averse to sameness, and when you hear
“warm!” “hot!” “very hot!” “devilish hot!” “hot
as h I ” all day long as the day progresses, the weari-
ness of it settles on your soul. There is no shade on the
plains except when you conceal yourself behind a
mosquito.

“W.”: Apropos several things. As an
infant I was devoted to my nurse—a coal-black
Dyraaba gin. Used to clasp her round the neck
and kiss her; follow her to camp, squat at the
fire and gnaw a ’possum bone, or a ’guana tail,
with much satisfaction. Yet —to-day the sight of
a gin makes me sniff involuntarily and deviate.

Again, my father loved drink, which in the end
so requited him that, in trying to avoid a hole
that wasn’t there, he fell into one that was, and
was killed. Yet I could never drink even beei’,
and absolutely loathe spirits. Have never been
drunk, nor even “merry” ; and xny constitution,
on doctors’ evidence, is exceptionally strong.
Which upsets one theory of the temperance advo-
cate.

Strange no one rises to protest against
that most hideous of all bush curses—the horse-
bell. Strapping a bell on a horse’s neck on
letting him go at night is a habit contracted by
the Australian before the era of fences. Ii these
times most horses are fed, and therefore loaf about
the camp, but the bell is dangled on them just the
same. Even when camping about a town the
Australian hangs the blastiferous bell on his moke,
quite indifferent to the fact that he is thereby
depriving dozens of people of their sleep. If you
drive the bell-ringing brute away from you the
owner considers it a personal affront, almost call-
ing for violence. His belief in the absolute right
of his accursed beast to ring a big dinner-bell in
your ear at any hour of the night is something
pathetic.
No use howling against the camel.
Boulia (N.Q.) has been drought-stricken
for months, and of late famine-stricken
also. Neither horse nor bullock team
could relieve it. T’other day, the arrival
of a camel-team saved the place from
sheer starvation. Curse the Afghan driver
if you like, but, till the flying-machine
arrives, it’s folly execrating the camel.

“AlexM.”: I can believe “Yam” (B.
17/2/’00) about that vet’s system of canine
therapeutics; because, as a lad, I used for several
years to earn a quarterly half-sov. by “ curing” a
maiden-aunt’s pug of the effects of too much
banquet. Used to be handed over to me, a bloated
monstrosity, hardly able to waddle ; whereupon,
to begin with, I would give him every day for a
week (on the quiet) a. “scrap” with a diminutive
hero of an Irish terrier, and the way the combined
funk and exertion used to take the blubber off
puggy was a caution. During this week of war
and woe I fed the patient sparingly ; but, when he
began to show some ability to keep his end up, I
knew it was time for about a week of nearly abso-
lute starvation. Then a third week of moderate
diet would put the final polish on him, and I’d
send him home in light marching order and as
frisky as a kitten.

Long ago, before the war, there was a dis-
tinctly famous Absent-Minded Beggar in Two-
wharves. He was a young three-quarter-caste
named Tommie Pipeful. The timbergetters called
him “the cove without a memory.” He lived at
the blacks’ camp ; and his English vocabulary
was very poor save in swear-words. There it was
as plentiful as rabbits. Because of his grotesquely
defective memory, he was the worst messenger in
all the Big Scrub. He would repeat the pith of a
message over and over again—and forget it while
so repeating. One day he was sent by Willie
Jimmie Jimmie (the blacks called the latter for
short “ Jimmie-two times-twice ”) to “Ruggy”
Ned’s mill for a cross cut saw. Tommie went off
repeating vigorously “ Karose-cut-sore,” etc., etc.
When he saw “Ruggy” Ned, he said, “Willie
Chimmie Chimmie bin wanta lenda dat pfella—er
dat pfella—oh, baal, mine tink of it bimeby.”
“Haxe?” “No.” “Hadze?” “No.” “Maul-
unwedgez?” “No not dat pfella.” “Oh,
well, what does he want, Tommie?” “Baal,
mine fogit hiss plurry name. You know dat pfella
got plurry sharp teeth. Him—him—van an’ come
back agin like dis,” and Tommie Pipeful ran to
and fro on the floor making dismal noises as if he
required to be oiled. “Oh, Hogan’s ghost ! He
wants th’ crorss-cutsaw, Tommie.” “ Yowi, dat’s
da pfella.” Tommie carried the saw down to his
gun yah ; but by the time he got t' e r he forget
for whom he had borrowed it, and w. ile he was
trying to remember this he forgot that he had bor-
rowed anything.
“Eller”: The squatters around Narrabri
are very dissatisfied with the Govt, for not making
a start with the rabbit-proof fences to Yarraldool.
They state rabbits are increasing rapidly. If the
Govt, will take my humble advice it wiil waste no
more money this way. A rabbit-proof fence
makes little or no difference to bunny. He. climbs
them like a cat and moves north—rabbits always
have a tendency to move north— until the next
fence is met. Then he goes over that.

“E.K.”: We camped down in Snake
Valley, me and Ginger, alongside a water-hole.
Ginger played his mouth-organ ; I smoked. After
a time heard a queer hissing and rustling, looked
round, and, by gad, there was a whole army of
snakes,_ up on their hind legs, bobbing up and
down, in and out, dancing to Ginger’s music. 1

WATTLE FLAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When I was digging in the hills—’way up on Wattle Flat,
A parson came to straighten us—a little one at that.
He told us we should sling the cards, and give the liquor
best—
And oh ! ’twas grand to hear the way he’d chuck it off his
chest!
Said he : “ My friends, you’re going to hell—damnation’s
very near.
You are a blanky Godless lot —you wretched slaves of
beer!
Give up your Sunday football now—avoid the flaming
pub—
And let’s improve, our minds and start a parlymsnt’ry
club.”
We reckoned that he’d struck a patch —if none would act
the goat;
And met the follering Friday to decide “ Should Women
Vote?”
The chaps rolled up to see the fun—and girls! Each
brought his own.
A bit of skirt, the parson said, would give the thing a
tone.
He wouldn't take the chair—he thought ’twas best for
one of us.
So we elected Ratty Bill—who took it with a cuss.
He always sunk a duffer, when he tried to talk— but, still,
He’d stoush a blooming bullock, so we all respected Bill.
And then the parson pitched it strong about our sisters’
rights.
But Bli-me Joe, he reckoned only them should vote as
fights.
“That bars you, then!” was my remark —which ter-
minated Joe’s.
It ain’t the chaps as flash their dukes that flglit the

Then .nick the Giant started with, “ The man’s a rotten

“ You mustn’t swear,” the Speaker said—“ You’ll break
the blanky rule.”
“When I’m wanting infermation,” said Mick, “of any
sort—
Of course, I’ll take it from a man that’s got a shingle
short.”
“ I’m boss,” said Bill; “ they’ve put me here to carry out
the law—
Sit down, and put yer flute away—or else I’ll break yer
jaw.”
Mick started poking it again—but ere he’d said it all—
The pair of them, in willing holts, were rastling for the
fall.
It was a lively argument, and, long before its close,
A dozen keen debaters were a-dressing ayes and noes.
The little devil-dodger was a-yellin’ for the p’lice ;
But we were holding down the trap to let ’em fight in
peace.
There’s whips of self-improvement in a parlyment, no

A Well-Known Railway Worker.
Mr. Harry Gibson, a well-known railway official,
ever takes an earnest if quiet interest in all that
pertains to the welfare of the state or individual.
Thus, so popular is he amongst his fellov.
workers that when he was found to be missing
from their ranks for some considerable time, his
absence occasioned great conjecture.
A reporter was sent to elucidate the mystery,
and this is what Mr. Gibson told him.
‘'Missed me from my old haunts, have you?”
said he. “Well, it has been this way. Until
lately I have not been able to get about as I used,
for my joints swelled to a great extent and became
very stiff. If I moved at all they gave me the
greatest pain. Every bone in my body ached with
rheumatism, but my shoulders, arms and legs were
the worst. At night the pain kept me awake,
liven in fine weather I suffered agonies, which
increased when it rained. As the dull, wearying
ache gave place to sharp twinges upon the slightest
movement, I did not get about much.
“ Acting upon a friend’s advice, I tried Dr.
Williams’ pink pills. The first box relieved me
and four boxes cured me. The stiffness in my
joints completely subsided, and I am active and
strong and can get about as well as ever. It is
nine months since I have used Dr. Williams’ pink
pills, and I went through last winter without one
twinge.”
The last statement shows that Mr. Gibson has
been cured permanently (otherwise the pains would
have recurred before this). Dr. Williams’ pink
pills cure permanently because they act on the
cause of disease, not on the mere signs and symp-
toms. As a blood-builder and nerve tonic they
are unequalled ; the numerous cures they have
performed prove this. These include paralysis,
dysentery, consumption, bronchitis, weak heart,
chronic dyspepsia, insomnia, ladies’ ailments,
debility, anaemia, etc. Obtainable from Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Co., Queen’s Place, Sydney,
two and nine per box, six boxes fifteen and three,
and from chemists and storekeepers. But mind
you ask for Dr. Williams’, for these are the kind
which Mr. Gibson used. *

to leave hastily to catch his horse, which pulled
away and cleared out. On the way back he saw a
crow rise from the camp with something that
glittered in the sunlight. Tumbling to his loss he
galloped after the “parson,” waving his arms
about like flails and objurgating in a gummy and
profane manner in the hope that he might scare it
into dropping the set. Casual swaggies who
pas ;od during the chase had the monotony of the
track brightened by the sight, and were satisfied
they had seen a rabid crow-crank who would kill
a good horse in running after a single bird. A
wire-fence beat the horseman, and the bird flew
on to plant the seeds of another Taranganba or a
second mountain mystery in the ridges. Now the

his eye, and feelingly adds half'-a-crown a week to the rent.
That is to say, he increases tlie value of his proputty by
£5O, and charges the other person 12) per cent, interest
on the money. Then he writes a letter to the Argus com-
plaining that a new burden of taxation has been dumped

In one town in the Woolly West there have been
recently seven fires in rapid succesiion, with a loss of
£20,000 and one human life. A spark from a shooting
star set fire to one place, and in another some rats got
drunk on kerosene and then had a snack of wax matches
—and the rest was easy. Again, at a drapery bargain-sale
the goods were going off so fast that the heat thus gener-
ated ignited the premises ; and in yet another case a
burning ember is supposed to have floated 500 miles from
a fire in Brisbane and set light to a grindstone, which in
turn caused the destruction of the establishment*.

bars lately the landlady was bemoaning the cost of the
counter-lunch. “In meat-pies alone we get through 60
dozen a week in this house, and this exclusive of sausage-
rolls, &0., and such things as bread, cold meat, hot
corned beof, and so on. The people look for them, and if
they don’t get them they won’t como.” While the lady
was talking one customer had three good cuts at a pig’s
cheek, two sausages, bread, tomatoes and onions—and
then she left for fear the spectacle would prove too much
for her good nature.

“ Elle ” : Have often heard of putting newly-
wetted corn in tight boots to stretch them, and have
found it answer admirably. Pilled a bottle with corn the
other day and wet it, and it burst the bottle. Have a
theory ii >w that there must have been wet corn in the
banks in ’.16, and they burst through it swelling up. How
much corn would it take, do you think, to break a gaol ?

Fitzgibbon, the autocrat of Melbourne Board of
Works, lias been badly defeated by a Chow idolator. The
worshipper of graven images runs a garden on the banks
of the Yarra, in which the asparagus is urged on its wild
career and the tomato springs up like the devices of the
ungodly. From time unknown the pagan has irrigated
his garden free of cost, and it was only recently that the
official brain “dropped” to the fact and fixed a water-
meter upon the premises. But the yellow man ingen-
iously tinkered with the indicator so that the quantity of
water passing through the meter was not registered. And
the garden flourished. After much deep thought the
Board detected the ruse, and a metal liood was placed to
fit tightly over the meter. This was held in position by
iron chains, the couplings being taped and sealed so that
any manipulation might be readily detected. But the
cabbage cultivator was equal to even this emergency. He
secured a stamp whose impression so exactly resembled
the board's seals that for a time the officers failed to dis-
cover that the Asiatic was regularly breaking the seals,
removing the chains, lifting the metal hood, blocking the
indicator, and surreptitiously irrigating his carrot
patches. When Fitzgibbon heard of this latest iniquity
the plumbers went forth and removed the water service
from the garden altogether. The resourceful Mongolian
now pumps water from the Yarra on to the melons and
asparagus beds. The board is quite cross over the matter,
and has worn the office law-book to rags hunting up
statutes to compel the pig-tailed one to pay for irrigation,
but so far the Chinaman is well ahead.

W.A. Premier Forrest is the newest kind of
mining expert, as witness this extract from a recent W.A.
Hansard :
The Premier : A reef could be dredged just in the same
way as soft stuff, and work of the kind could be seen at
Fremantle.
Mr. Kingsmill: But the reef would have to be blasted
first.
The Premier :No ; without blasting at all. Dredges
were so strong now that a great deal was being done in
this way at Fremantle without blasting.
Mr. Gregory : It would be a most inconvenient way to
work a reef.
The Premier : It appeared to be a capital way.
Mr. Gregory : How deep would a dredge be able to go ?
The Premier : A dredge would follow the reef to a
depth of 30ft. probably.

Four youths recently sued in Melbourne
District Court for wages and arrears
owing to them by a firm of elec-
trical engineers. Some months ago
the parents of the boys paid a premium
of £5O each for them to acquire a
knowledge of electrical engineering. J!o>
the lads allege that they were kept in blissful ignorance of
the business a,nd spent their time doing plumbing work
and odd jobs in the bell-hanging line. They played cards
or amused themselves anyhow they could when' business
was slack and it was a long time between bell-hangings.
Query: Isn’t it about time the premium business was
abolished? The firm which yearns after “youth with
premium to be taught the business ” is mostly the firm
which has very little business to teach the youth.
Artist A. H. Fullwood.
Artist A. H. Fullwood has turned his studio in
Paling’s Buildings into an exhibition of oil and
water-color paintings, black-and-white work,
pencil drawings and etchings—in all about 150
subjects. A catalogue has been prepared, the
pictures have been docketed, and the public is
invited to drop in and buy, for Mr. Fullwood has
definitely decided to leave Australia for fresh
fields and paddocks new. Albert Henry Fullwood
is 35 years of age, and was born in Birmingham.
As soon as he could wield a pencil he "went
to the local art-schools, and was a contemporary
student with W. J. Wainwright, R.W.S., Walter
Langley, R. 1., and several other well-known men
in the world of art. While still in his teens, or
barely out of them, he exhibited in many of the
principal exhibitions in England. When'2l years
of age Mr. Fullwood came to Australia,' and
worked for the local press. After a year of this
experience, “ The Picturesque Atlas ” was laid
upon the stocks, and he was attached to the staff
of that publication, and worked over the greater
part of what is recognised as settled Australia for
three years. Mr. Fullwood has also represented
the London Graphic for about eleven years,
during which time many of his drawings of
Australian current events have appeared. He has
from time to time contributed to the pages of The
Bulletin. Amoung the pictures now being ex-
hibited are several sketches of “Old Sydney”

artist.

“bits” of the city that have disappeared and are
disappearing—representations of scenery from
Maoriland, Tasmania, Sydney Harbour, “Up-
country,” etc., and a capital etching of the “Black
Horse at Richmond —a celebrated honey-moon
resort in the early days. There are several
pictures of historic interest, too, notably a large
water-color of a now defunct erection—to wit,
the old bridge at Mosman—an old whaling
station ; a black-and-white of the great Federal
meeting in the Town Hall, Sydney—the original
drawing of the picture reproduced in the London
Graphic; and the “Royal Tar” leaving Sydney
for Paraguay—another Graphic original, repre-
sentative of the New Australia movement. Two
large pictures of merit are a view of the Hawkes-
bury River, and a big interior entitled “ Bad
news from the Seat of War.”

A PRECOCIOUS CHILD.
W ARRNAMBOOyL, Friday.
The’little fellow named. Richardson, who
■was charged at Colae with stealing and dis-
posing 01 a pony for £4 afc Garvoc, visited
the Warrnambool races -last week, and
stayed the night at one of the hotels in ,the :
town. He left early the next morning,
having booked by train through to Colac.
During his stay he showed himself very
self-possessed for a boy of nine, but his
youthful instincts were not kept totally

Christian’s Protest : Sentiment noble. Verse
only medium.... 11. Clifton : Sorry you take it so seri-
ously. The ink-bottle isn’t much of a trade to long- for at
best..'. .A.D.E. : “Nocturne” well-written, but hardly
enough in it, and the thing the old man called the cook
isn’t publishable... .Chaput : Feel like saving something
severe, almost insulting:. ..Absent-Minded Beggar : The
local A.M. Beggars didn’t pay their bills before leaving,
and you got left John F. : It isn’t poetry—only a
mechanical stringing together of bid rhymes!... Helen
B. : Very slender trifle—almost bony Joe Rocks : Too
rocky. Dynamite par. will do W.J.C. : Don’t enthuse
over letters from Hell B. Outtrim : Thanks
Gobung : Humor of that stamp has been so hard-worked
that on'v exceptional brilliance would now “carry” it.
F.-a.x clynH. : Mildly platitudinous.... E.S. : “Tram”
should have.had either more “story.” or cleverer hand-
ling — Planet: Won’t ornament Bulletin firmament.
lndi : Dull and prosy Eunella : Not dramatic
force enough to condone the somewhat conventional
pathos M.W. : Graceful enough, but no novelty or
force L. M‘D. : May touch-up for type Caniiro :
“Patriot” rather thin in places. Will weigh.... Per-
suasion : Perspicuity of style depends so largely upon
perspicacity of nrnd that books can do little more than
teach what to avoid. You might try Abbott and Seeley’s
work on English composition... .P.F. : Have cut you
d own to about one-fourth, and removed the foolish sneers
founded on the fallacious assumption that the man who
doesn’t agree with the people you agree with must be
wrong.... Bark : May be. There’s certainly no bite in it.
J.O.D. : Have you had snakes in your boots, or are
you going to have ’em?....A. Walker : (1) The British
Government bought Cape Colony, inhabitants and all,
from Holland. (2) A large body of Dutch “ trekked ” into
the wilderness beyond British territory, and founded
Natal, the Orange Free' State, and the Transvaal.
Britain annexed Natal. Later it annexed the Orange
Free State, but gave it up and acknowledged its inde-
pendence in 1854. Annexed part of it again (the Diamond
Fields) in after years. Annexed the Transvaal Republic
in 77, and gave it up in’Bl after the defeat at Majuba,
when the republ c resumed business again. The conven-
tion made in 1881 admitted British suzerainty. It lasted
three years. In 1881 a new convention was made in which
the word suzerainty was not mentioned. The annexation
of the Transvaal in 77 was made largely owing to the peti-
tion of a small body of British residents in the country
Splur : Looks wonderful enough in manuscript—mostly
by reason of the writing. Wouldn’t look much in print.
...J.S.M. : Terrible war-horse poem... .L.M.D. : “Briggs”
hardly “ gets there ” E.K. : Indian ink, bristol board
an 1 any pen that will make clean, firm lines 8.0.8. :
Rather undressful item W.L.B. : “ Life blood ” won’t
r.iyme to “ man’s blood.” Also other objections Jeff :
Gave up at end of Bth verse E.E.R. :Re Lancer poem.
(1) They r didn’t all volunteer ; (2) they aren’t “ in it every
time ” —in fact they missed most of the big fights ; (3) it
isn’t a specially “bloody war”—up till now the destruc-
tion done in the whole war doesn’t begin to compare with
the slaughter done in one day at Waterloo ; (4) also the
Lancers haven’t “on each breast a large V. 0.” V.C.s
aren’t brought round in a cart and shovelled out John
Stanmore: Nearly good enough Patsy: “Autograph”
will d0....R.R. : Written in ’5l and only moder-
ately good for its age I. Weester (a subscriber):
We like to hear a good, loud, vigorous howl. Howl
again.... Alias: Suggestion already in type Horse-
tralian : Dunno... .E. 0.1. : First two verses good.
Then there is a falling off... .N.J.O. : Will probably use
“Out of the Past.”.... A.L. : “Ben’s Spree” good but
too slight A.L. : Neat little bit; may use S. &S. :
Will make par, 0n1y.... A. J.O. :No strength or distinc-
tion. ... Ruthie G. : Weak sentiment in weak verse....
W.M F. : “ Lovers,” will consider Winda : Could have
been made much more of dramatically Ben W. : Too
elaborate and stilted Stiggins : Send it along; it will
get a fair “show.”... .Ruperto: But to call a man a
traitor proves nothing... .Lucy P. : Some originality and
force. What you lack is experience Signa : What we
could decipher wasn’t worth deciphering T.P.K. :
Question 1. Nothing of the kind on record ; though
attempts have been made, by inoculating horses, °to
obtain a protective serum. 2. Yes; they can co-exist.
Prodigal: Not worth printing A.A.G. : “Kid,”
crude, and generally unsatisfactory. Other better, but
too long in the wind, and too much littered with Maori
words Eugene P. F. : Little skill in the handling.
G. Over: Badly muddled. If the woman wanted a
divorce, why should she employ a detective to watch
Herself? ... .H.M. : Will consider.... .Cvmbal: You don’t
tinkle worth a cent Sallie B. : “Can I think ear
awhile comand?” No, Sarah—not even if you
could spell Darby: One good line —“The wide
white ways of God.” Hope you didn’t steal that!.
Geo. S. : Only worth paragraph G.B. (Brisb.) : Resi-
dence in N.S.W. before marriage is practically unneces-
sary J.A.W. : Unusable C.P.N. : Only drawing-
room album verse P. 0.0. : Gleams of rugged energy
here and there, but the “ bush idle ” is a failure on the
wh01e.... Q. : This eternal boasting about what the Aus-
tralian troops are going to do is sickening. The French
yell in ’7O about how they were going to Berlin was
nothing to it Wap-wo : Two excellent verses, and then
an unfortunate tailing-off Anti-Bulletin : Certainly
The Bulletin has the effrontery to have its own opinions
The other kind of paper is the one that hasn’t any, but
says that a thing must be right because the British
Government says it is—the kind whose conscience is kept
in somebody else’s tail-pocket The Foundling: Un-
printable Alice : Can’t make head or tail of poem
Lorna Doone : Received with thanks.. J.A P • Con-
sidering verses... .0.P.Q.0. : Will print “As in the Be-
ginning.” “ Forerunners ” excellent.. ..Narranghi Boori :
Fenny in the Slot ” too rugged Plymouth Sound :
Good verse, but the Magdalen biz. doesn’t want any poetic
encouragement in this country Willow : “ Schreiner ”
rejected. T’other rejected worse Helen B. : Will print
“Ideal.”....lrish O. : Much better let it alone—tor
a number of good reasons.... Wroogemong: Good literary
style, but plot thin and not too wholesome Non-
Jingoist: Nobody knows whether Britain has held a
suzerainty over the Transvaal since ’Bl. The suzerainty
was provided for in the ’Bl convention. The convention
of ’Bl abolished that of ’Bl in many respects, but it
neither formally abolished, or confirmed, or even men-
tioned the suzerainty Melbourne: Yes, they are
“afraid to come out in the open.”... .An Australian
Thanks R.W. : Some verses of your ode herewith :
H. Ingemann : Rejected with things that are better
left unsaid—E.L.M. : Hardly up to high-poem mark
R.R. : “Memories” and “Parted” both very pretty
verses that ripple musically over a bed of very old sub-
jects. Such themes as “ days of long ago ” are very trite.
.. ..Uloola : Good verse, but war poems are growing a
little wearisome... .N.R.G. : The prospective widow of
the man who has gone Boer-hunting is already ten times
better provided for than the average widow of the aver-
age miner, sailor, lumper, &c., who is killed in the course
of his work. This crying out for more grease for the
already fatted cause is wearisome, especially when the
money is mostly made up by reducing subscriptions to
charities quite as deserving and in much greater need
A.H. : Not up to Bulletin mark, but not without pro-
mise. .... Ida : Rather pretty—but mawkish and unreal.
Cecil W. : Well-written and pathetic. May use
R.B.W. : But sentimentalism is not sentiment—except
in so far as it is sentiment about sentiment. The one is
spontaneous ; the other, second-hand and factitious
Claypan : Won’t consider anything so abominably scrib-
bled John W. : Commendably curt; may use
Count B. : Hardly' up in point of handling... . .Barb W. :
Absolute rubbish Fleetwood : True enough, but not
new. And the people who swallow such yarns are mostly
asses to begin with Yel : Good stuff in it, but bad y
arranged, and too long Zulu : Humor too obviously
pumped-up..... Marian S. :If you used shorter sentences
you wouldn't tie yourself into such weird syntactical knots
Wirrup : Accept our blessing—and refrain. We are
very weary of Kruger-poems Chummie: Laudable effort,
marred by grievous lack of skill and experience Wjil
J. : Traces of power, but you misuse common words and
violently outrage probability H.D.P. : A neat little
nothing... .Willie M. : Embodies the cold, cruel truth,
but lacks power of presentation Bertram: Flarn-
marion, the distinguished astronomer, points out, re that
century question, that the 100th cent is as necessary' to
the dollar as the Ist cent. Just the illustration The
Bulletin has used over and over again ; and, though it
doesn’t require a “ distinguished ” anything to grasp
such a simple fact, the' noble army of muddle-
heads will probably accept Flammarion’s authority....
Hairpins : Pun about Joe Chamberlain and Joe Hannes-
burg received with moderate curse.... Judas Jones: Many'
bright spots in “ L. Brown,” but metre too erratic anil
theme too steep....V. : Sorry to disappoint you, but
“ Chookv ” Fowler is hardly'worth the trouble...*. O.M. A. :
Not a strong enough trifle Bul-Bul: “What is the
literary' gift?” Broadly’ and briefly, the power of
sa.ying something worth hearing in a manner worth
listening t 0... . P.T.F. : “Immolation” approaches the
hysterical in places, but otherwise strong. Will
consider... .W.A.D. : Will print “Cross-line 8e11”....
Magnet: Pretty, but odes to mountains need to be more
than that. The long-metre, blank-verse poem which
starts “ O thou ” something or other is difficult to handle.
. ...G. (Yarrahdale) : Not unusual enough. ..Old Colonist:
“ Solicitor Smith ” instead of “Mr. John Smith, solicitor,”
saves space. That’s a 11.... Mill Phay : A.-M. Beggar pic-
tures, jokes and poems are now a weariness to the flesh
and a ton of lead on the spirit.

BRUMMY BILL: “ Why can't then send the bloomin
police to the war and give a bloke a charnst? ”
They’ve horsemen without number,
Like the bloodhounds in the slips
Their arsenals forge thunder,
Their dockyards vomit ships ;
They and their offspring allies,
Wh )’JI kill at their command,
Will cover all your valleys,
And darken all your land.
Old man, what are you doing ?
What’s now your great intent ?
Whan were such hosts on ruin
E'er by the devil sent ?
Think as the tempest gathers
Round your little ones and wives,
Stout Dutchmen saved their fathers
Their freedom and their lives !
Think when the shells are falling
Thicker than summer rain,
Your memory recalling
The locust hordes of Spain,
More foes than could be reckoned
Darkened their hollow land,
For not one single second
Did God withhold His hand !

Sleep When Work is Done.
Dining' the late summer (189 G) I passed several
weeks in a foreign city nearly 700 miles further
1 i than London. We had about ten days
n Cense heat, and for six nights when it was worst,
a ao not think I slept as many hours altogether,
xne resulting nervous collapse was simply awful,
j ~ Oram reeled and I con’d neither understand nor
a° anything rightly. I walked, as the good Book
111 a vain show. ” What a blessed thing is
Meep ; how destructive, how killing to lose it.
in healthy sleep the nervous system is inactive
tOe brain and spinal cord.
a >e body lies quiet, the muscles relaxed, the pulse
tower than when we are awake, and the breathing
, us ' s >'«quent but deeper. Then nature —wise
'eepcr of the House of Life—proceeds to renew
tbe energies expended through the day. To miss
tins renewal, even in part, is to tread the edge of
insanity and look into the mouth of death.
-Methought I heard a voice cry, ‘Sleep no
VI Macbeth doth murder sleep!’” So said
- lacUoth himself; but there is a power which
murders more sleep than ever did Duncan’s
assassin ; and to that Mrs. Beattie alludes when
she says of her daughter, “ She got no sleep.”
T *■;!* May, 1891,” writes the lady, “my daughter
Aie.itia fell into a low, weak condition, and could
not get up her strength. She had no appetite,
and what little food she took gave her great pain
at the chest and side. She got no sleep at night,
and became very nervous and low spirited.
As time passed by she grew weaker and more
aVi’ an<l vve t'D'Ught she would never get better.
-A. doctor attended her but none of his medicines
seemed to suit her case, and for two years she
continued to suffer.
“ One day she read in a book about Mother
oeigel s Curative Syrup and what it had done for
others. She got a bottle from Mr. Nicholls,
chemist, Donegal Place, and after taking it began
to improve, being able to eat, and her food
agreeing with her. After having used this medi-
cine a short time she was strong and well as ever,
and has since been in good health. For a long
t ime 1 myself suffered from weakness and indiges-
tion, and seeing what good Mother Seigel’s Syrup
had done I took it and was completely restored to
sound health, You may use this statement as
you like. (Signed) (Mrs.) Maijy Beattie, 23,
Inmty Square, Belfast, August 14th, 1896.”
•‘ln the early part of 1894,” writes another, “I
began to suffer from indigestion. I had a poor
appetite, and all food gave me pain at my chest
and a gnawing feeling at my stomach. No
matter how light the food I took I had paiii and
sick headache,
‘bur over a year I was tormented like this,
when Mr. John Weir, living in this place, told me
how he had been cured by Mother Seigel’s Syrup,
and recommended me to try it. I did so, and
soon all pain left me, and I have since enjoyed
good health. I know many persons residing in
this district who have often been benefited by
taking the same medicine. Often in my shop I
hear persons say what it has done for them. You
arc a.t liberty to publish this letter. (Signed) Alex
\v ilson, General Merchant, Castlewellan, New-
castle, Co. Down, Ireland, Aug. 15th, 1896.”
Indigestion or dyspepsia destroys the power to
sleep by starving, and thus weakening the nervous
system. Indeed the whole body starves, and is
thrown into profound disorder. Food may be
taken into the stomach, but. as people constantly
say, “It does no good. ” No ; but in a sense it
does harm. Fermented, soured, undigested it
develops poisons which act upon the system some-
what as a pestilence does upon a community,
flesh is lost, strength gives away to trembling
weakness, courage is supplanted by fear, and life
is dreary and desolate. That Mother Seigel's
Syrup should be able to cure a disease so common
and so terrible is reason for gratitude to us all.
For the healthy work and sleep.
“ With a little more experience, Bovill
will be the worst Judge on the Benoh.” — Ballan-
tine.
Septimus A. Stephen, whose London lec-
ture on “Sydney—Past and Present” is going
the rounds, was seventh in the family of the late
Chief-Justice, C.-J. Stephen was father of 18
children—nine boys and nine girls. Nine were
bom to him when a barrister, and nine when a
Judge. He had nine by his first wife and nine
by the second. Nine were bom in Tasmania and
nine in N.S.W. Five sons and four daughte.s
were born in Hobart, and four sons and five
daughters in Sydney. Two of the boys were
twins, and two of the girls. By the way, why
does not “Seppy” Stephen allow his father’s
autobiography to see the light. That would be
Sydney—“ Past ” at any rate.
“ Old Jack ” gossips concerning some old-
time N.S.W. litterateurs:—
“ Kendall’s letter to Harpur deals with Stenhouse as a
critic; his memorial verses deal with him as a man."
Thus “ Red Page ”of 28th Oct. But those who suppose
that poets—especially of Kendall's build—write memorial
verses, or critical sneers, because they are saturated with
conviction of the fidelity of their motives, want to go to
school. Kendall, of all men, could work up a spurious or
artificial enthusiasm, which would take this shade or that
ae«)rdin»-to his humor. When his humor hadn't been
sufficiently stimulated it was inclined to rail at the hand
that gave. Indeed, that was the poor devil’s prevailing
humor. Weak, vain, childishly sensitive, and without
the capacity of being contented with his gifts, but afflicted
with an itch of envy of those who possessed higher, Ken-
dall was always eating his own heart. By the way, when
present writer first met him he was eating pork pies and
drinking rum arid water, in the Currency Lass tavern.
Also he was writing a “poem” called “Manasseh ” —a
noble apostrophe, which he asked me to read and then
presented to me. The grease-marks of his fingers linger
still on the paper. I once found Kendall in pawn in a
Waterloo pub. Had stuck up drinks, and Mr. Public
House had collared his boots and hat as collateral se-
curity. “If even I were to write his epitaph, dear boy,”
said the poet, tearfully, 11 he wouldn’t take it in exchange
for my boots." “ What’s an epitaph ?” demanded Bun<'.
“ A lie on a gravestone,” said Kendall. “If you give me
my hat and boots I’ll tell the biggest lie about you that
imagination could devise." “ You’re a rum un,” said the
publican. “ Here you are; ” and he handed over the hat
and boots. By the way, the “boots” were slippers.

“ H.” : The case in which Edward Gibbon
Wakefield, afterwards so illustrious as a coloniser
in South Australia, Maoriland, and Canada,
served three years’ imprisonment for abducting
an heiress, is worth some detail, being almost
unknown. It was in 1826, Wakefield being a
young widower. His first marriage had been to a
supposed heiress, but it appears he was taken in,
and his heiress had no money. He lived in Paris,
where his young step-mother came on a pleasure-
trip. She told him she had found him a real
heiress, sweet Ellen Turner, 15 years old, only
child of the Cheshire sheriff, who resided on his
Estate of Shrigley. Wakefield had never seen or
heard of this girl. Nevertheless the abduction
was at once planned, the stepmother being the
brain of the whole affair. Miss Turner was cap-
tivating and described as intelligent, notwith-
standing the stupidity with which she acted.
Wakefield had no money, but the indispen-
sable step-mother went to a money-lender on
a Sunday, and borrowed £l5O, representing that
it was to liberate a relative arrested for debt.
The first thing Wakefield had to do was to extract
Miss Turner from the four Miss Daulbys. These
gorgons kept the Liverpool boarding school at
which Miss Turner was. By an incredible con-
catenation of successful lying about family cir-
cumstances of the Turners, Wakefield persuaded
the eldest and presumably most discreet Miss
Daulby to relinquish custody of the girl. The
next step was to persuade Miss Turner that she
must marry Wakefield, to secure payment cf
£60,000 to her father, who was alleged to be in
dire monetary straits. All this reads like the plot
of a bad novel, but is absolute fact. They went
off to Gretna Green, and were married.
Wakefield stopped, according to the evidence,
at the mere ceremonial, but had the girl
in his possession for a week. They went
next to Calais (France) where the explosion took
place. Miss Turner’s two uncles and the family
solicitor had got on the scent. They saw the
pair looking into shop windows and laughing.
The next step was tracking. them to Madame
Quillac’s hotel. Here an infuriated uncle burst in
upon Wakefield, Miss Turner not being present.
After much violent language Wakefield brought
her in. She clung to him at first, but hearing of
the deception, and the agony of her father and
mother, she rushed to her uncle’s protection,
vowing she would never look on Wakefield again.
Apparently she never . did, except in their
encounter at the Lancashire assizes, where he was
convicted and sentenced, together with his brother
William as an accomplice. The stepmother
escaped punishment, though also convicted. In
Newgate Wakefield studied up colonial questions.
Thus the carcase yielded honey, or at least
history.
Ex-M.L.A. Tommy Walker, whom Syd-
ney, Melbourne and other Australian centres
remember with mixed feelings, orates Sunday
nights in Perth on the virtues of John Forrest,
horrest in his recent tour frequently referred to
lommy as a remarkably eloquent and convincing
orator “the finest speaker I have heard any-
W j r -o” If Tomm y gets into the W.A. House
and Big John lasts, Westralia may yet be bossed
by the mutually admiring pair.

POLITICAL
POINTS
A. J. Wilson, of the Investors’ Review,
estimates that the war is costing Great Britain
£2,000,000 per week.
“ Now is the time for the long-talked-of
morning Protectionist paper in Sydney,” was said
to a member of the Lyne Ministry the other day.
“ The Daily Telegbaph is doing very well,” was
the reply.
Vic. A.N.A. at Tts annual congress is to
deal with a proposal to admit Britishers-born of
five years’ Australian standing to membership,
and to change the name to The Australian
National Association. Thus does the new Ass
rise from the old one’s grave.
Five of the W.A. Transvaal contingent
came to grief the other day—one killed and four
wounded. They included two Victorians, one
Cornstalk, one Englishman and a West Indian—
not a Sandgroper amongst them. About the
scarcest individual in the Sandgroping contingent
is the Sandgroper himself.
The Vic. Education authorities have been
holding an indignant inquiry into the case of a
female teacher, who, it seems, expressed her sor-
row that there should be any war. The results
are not quite certain yet, but it is expected that
the lady will be let off with a warning to walk the
chalk line of strict loyalty in future, and say she
is Sarned glad of the war.
Ex-Premier Dickson left Brisbane the
other day for England, bearing letters of in-
troduction to Newcastle-on-Tyne people from
Thomas Glassey. The anxiety displayed by the
latter politician to be in some way identified with
every movement bearing the Q. Govt, brand is
amusing. As for stump orations and organising
missions (as in the days of yore)—T.G. knows them
no longer.
Another effort will be Ifiade in M.L. Par-
liament next session to remove the embargo from
sweeps. It is considered that Bill will have a better
chance this time in Lower House, at any rate.
Previously it has been sat upon in only a gentle
sort of fashion. The amount of bullion sent from
the province to- Australia since prohibition of
these little gambles would about buy both Islands.
But if sweeps are allowed, why shouldn’t the
State run its own sweeps ?
“Vic.”: The fund for'the widow and
orphans of John Hancock, M.L. A., could do with
more than a little assistance from other provinces.
It may be just my private delusion, but I hold
that Hancock would have proved second in value
to no member of the Australian Labor-party.
Anyhow, he served this country with all his might
while he lived, and now he is quite as dead as any
soldier who can possibly be killed ~ out Boer-
hunting, and quite as worthy.
Official utterances on same day of last
week: Premier Lyne—“N.S.W. Agent-General
will not be a commercial man, but will be assisted
by a commercial man”; “Minister for Mines
Began—“ Our next Agent-General must be a com-
mercial man.” But what does N.S.W. want any
Agent-General for ? In a few months more there
will be one A.G. for all the five federated pro-
vinces. To appoint a local A.G. now is simply to
give some friend or hanger-on a possible claim for
compensation.
The unexpected thing which was named
Higgins didn’t really happen in Victorian politics
after all. The Turner party decided not to sup-
port Higgins’s motion of censure on M‘Lean, and
the bald one, having no party of his own, didn’t
move the vote after all. The spectacle of the anti-
Federal Higgins wanting to throw out the anti-
Federal M‘Lean so as to help Federation, didn’t
seem to appeal to anybody. So Higgins darkened
the subject by a long, obscure explanation and
then dropped it.
The International Labor Conference
which met at Sydney to draw up a Federal pro-
gramme decided, among other things, that it
believed in the principle of old-age pensions. But
when a rash member proposed that the necessary
expense should be defrayed out of revenue the
conference wouldn’t hear of it. It evidently
wasn’t quite sure that even old-age pensions
shouldn’t come out of loans and be called a “ per-
manent and reproductive work,” and it declined
to commit itself.
Victorian P.M.Gr. Watt upended himself
and said that he was hostile to the despatch of the
first crowd of Boer-hunters (he was then only Watt,
Nothing), but he regarded his share in the des-
patch of the second one as the proudest
act of his life (he was then Hon. Watt, P.M.G,)
In the present state of popular frenzy Watt, if he
hadn’t approved of the second contingent, would
have certainly gone out of the Ministry on his
bright young ear. So he wisely hung on to his
portfolio and approved.
The voice of Ahab, who was a wise king in
Israel years ago :
Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as
he that putteth it off.
And the voice of Hassall, M.L.A., who is an un-
wise member of a Cow-Shaking Government in
New South Wales :
The Australian troops . . . had taken the Boers in
hand, and the Boers would find to their cost who they had
to deal with before the Australians were done with them.
He only wished he could go right into the thick of the
campaign with a good strong force of Australian bush
riders behind him. If so, he would guarantee that the
result would be a revelation, not only to the Boers, but to
all the world. The first thing he would do would be not
to charge them in the front in the regular army style of
doing that kind of thing, but would make a raid into the
country behind entrenchments and cut off their supplies.
With a sufficient number of the right kind of Australians
he would undertake to shake every horse, cow, calf, and
sheep within 100 miles of wherever the Boers might collect
their forces.
ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
RECRUIT: “I hear, sir, you
want recruits?”
CAPTAIN: “ Yes; hut
did you not yet your
discharge about a year
ago?”
R.: “ Yes, sir; but I was engaged to
my girl, and the regiment was going to England."
C.: “ It’s going to the Transvaal now.”
R.: “ I know, sir; but I’m married now, sir.”
“ H.G.” : The further the war progresses
the further the British War Office exposes either
its hopeless incompetence or its utter corruption.
The latter seems to be the more likely. An Aus-
tralian inventor, who left for England some
months ago with a model of a new slaughter
machine and £5OO cash, returned sorrowfully the
other day, as his means wouldn’t suffice to square
even the office-boy of the department. The way
that Ashton’s magazine-rifle has hung fire in Eng-
land, after the exhaustive and very satisfactory
trials, is another instance—to say nothing of the
refusal to look at Ashton’s high explosive at any
price, the prolonged silence about Alcock’s
position-finder, the value of which has been
mathematically proved, and the shelving of Body’s
submarine torpedo-boat. These things indicate
that somebody is making a nice little bit out of
the British taxpayer.
G. H. Reid, having returned to Sydney,
has laid down his fighting platform so far as he
(being always in the provisional state) ever lays
down any tiling, except himself when he is going
to sleep. He claims most of the Lyne legislation
and finance as his; but he won’t own the Early-
Closing Act at any price. He says:
Such of the Sydney papers as I have seen suggest that
the expected has happened, and that what might have
been an unmixed blessing—for the object of the Act is
one of the noblest —is being tainted by its injustice, and
discredited by its imperfection. I suspend my final
opinion upon the working of the measure until I can
judge for myself.
In other words, Reid hasn’t had time to decide
yet whether the small shopkeepers who are agitat-
ing against the Act have a majority behind them
or not, and he is once more waiting to see how the
cat jumps. G. Reid has had one eye on the cat
and the other on his victuals all the days of his
life.
One or two members of the N.S.W.
Cabinet are in favor of meeting the impending
war-bill by increasing the tax on incomes derived
from property from 6d. to 9d. in the £. Such a
tax, if maintained for seven or eight years, should
about cover the bill, provided the war doesn’t last
very much longer. But a multitude of the people
who helped to make the war will be dead before
eight years have passed, and a multitude who had
no voice in making it will be liable to taxation
before then. Moreover, if the present military
and loyal fervor keeps up, Australia may have
another war or two on hand long before it has
finished paying for this one. The short way out,
and the honest way, is to put the income-tax up
to Is. in the £ and get rid of the lamentable bill
quickly. If the people are patriotic enough to yell
and not patriotic enough to pay, their patriotism
isn’t worth much.
EDITOR (to applicant for the place as descriptive reporter): “Have you (jot a fragrant fancy
and boundless imagination, young man? ”
APPLICANT: “ For twelve months I have written up interviews with persons who were cured by
Boiled Eggs for Exasperated People. ’
EDITOR: “ Consider yourself engaged, young man, at your own terms.”
An intelligent and honest kind of jingo—
the town clerk of Hawthorn—has suggested that
every local government body in Victoria should
levy an extra rate of id. or Id. in the £ in aid of
the war fund. Considering that such a large
section of the Victorian people throws up its joint
and several hat—not to speak of the rest of its
clothes - for the war, this business-like proposal to
start paying for it even in a small way ought to
meet with the approval of everybody. Yet
strangely enough it doesn’t seem to have met with
the cordial support of anybody.
The Sandgroper Government sends Parker,
Q.C., to England at large expense to “watch the
passage of the Commonwealth Bill.” As Westra-
lia has absolutely nothing to do with the Common-
wealth Bill, Parker, Q.C., will presumably stand
outside Parliament House, Westminster, and look
up at the windows while the Bill is going through.
It is about the only way he can watch it. Still, he
may be John Forrest’s 42nd or 27th cousin, and
he, perhaps, requires change of air at the public
expense. All the influential people in W.A.
require occasional change of air at the public ex-
pense.
There is a tendency for wages to go up in
Victoria owing to the departure of so many men for
the war. This fact was the subject of remark the
other day by an alarmed member of the Legisla-
tive Council. “But surely,” he exclaimed, “for
reasons of patriotism, men will never ask for a rise
in wages at a time like this ! The man who asks
for a rise because of the shortness of labor at this
time is a damned traitor to his country ! ” “ What
of the man who reduced wages because of the
abundance of labor ? ” said the other. Then the
M.L.C. got angry, and called the other a Boer spy,
or something to that effect.
A few days ago ex-Preinier Reid made this
apparently innocent remark :
The civil servant who honestly believes that England is
engaged in an immoral campaign should no more be
silenced than t, who conscientiously believe that the war
was absolutely necessary.
It seemed a perfectly innocent observation in
defence of the most elementary principles of
liberty and free speech. Yet the grovelsome
Australian Star was roused to frenzy, and
yelled in great headlines “ Treason in the Service,”
“ Applauded by Mr. Reid.” So freedom of
thought, which was all Reid contended for, is
Treason nowadays, and the doctrines of the Inqui-
sition are in full-blast once more, or in as full-
blast as the Cow-Shaking Ministry and its organ
can manage.
Tasmania’s new Premier tells a great
truth:—
Renewals and repairs of roads, bridp-es and jetties have,
in spite of many protests, been from time to time charged
to loans. This is, in my opinion, an improper proceeding.
Once a work, of whatsoever nature, has been charged to
loans, any renewal should be made chargeable to revenue.
The principle we shall seek to adopt is to maintain out of
revenue, to the full value of the amount expended on it,
such assets as have been constructed by loan money.
It is a good, honest idea, only it has taken a very
long time to get as far as these first rudiments of
honesty. And, having got thus far, is Premier
Lewis prepared to pass an Act making it illegal
and punishable for any Government to charge
patches and repairs to loans ? Having found out,
in however small a way, what is right, is he
courageous enough to so arrange things that the
right policy shall be the permanent fixed policy of
the country ? When a Government finds out to
its great surprise that burglary is wrong it makes
burglary illegal. When it finds out that the mis-
appropriation of loan moneys is wrong, why not
make that illegal also ?
“Clipper” Paton, the democratic can-
didate for ensuing Hobart election, has just had
a lesson from what P.O. Fysh used to call “the
Tasmanian mob.” Paton was Holman’s chairman
when that eloquent anti-jingo was mobbed by a
crowd of “ patriotic ” hoodlums in Hobart recently,
and his dreadful sin has found him out. Attempted
to address the electors on the democratic platform
at the local Town Hall and was howled down. He
stuck to Lis task bravely for half an hour, but as
he couldn’t even hear himself speak, he de-
cided to give up the attempt. Men-o’-wars-
men from the Squadron were present in force,
but the cowardly unfairness of the proceed-
ings appealed to the soberest of them so
strongly that some half-dozen brawny tars formed
a body-guard and probably protected Paton from
personal violence. When Hobart’s large en-
lightened free citizens have to take a lesson in
decency from men-o’-warsmen, the “loyalty” of
that dreary village must be something too dread-
ful for respectable people to associate with. Still
“British fair-play” came on top that time. It
was British fair-play that kept Tasmanian hood-
lumism at bay.

R. BRASIER HE THUY, Principal Agent


Melb. Herald is struggling to popularise
barley water, and points out that Lord Brassey
had it prepared for his use daily. Barley water
the reader is assured, is extremely nourishing.
How explain Lord Thomas’s falling off, then?
In Brunswick (Victoria), the town whore
the Orange and Green shindies are, a local
householder recently painted a verandah-post
yellow. He meant to make it a bronze green
(paint green over yellow and partly rub off), but
when he was still in the first stage of the work an
indignant navvy with straws m his hair and three
pints of beer in his head interposed with a cry of
rage : “ What the ‘L d’ye mane by puttin on that
bl ash ted color?” he demanded warmly. the
artist explained that he was going to put green on
top of the yellow. “Is that it ? ” said the mollified
warrior. Begorra, come an av a drink, ino
bhoy or a dozen if ye want them. Come on. But
wait till I spit on the post.” And he expectorated.
“ E.K.” : Been reading a lot of the latest
books, newest style—all creeping things: hospitals,
gaols, madhouses, and so on. But not one on the
bone-yard. Could not some of your good! men
spend a night in one and write? Call it—“ Tomb-
stones that talk in the night.” (N.B.—“ Ships that
pass in the Night” is written on a consumptive
hospital—a very funnv book.) The tall, thin stone
could tell a story of how she lingered and wasted
away, and her dear children ditto. Then
the little fat stone that laughed and told inquest
stories. The Humor of the Post Mortem. Also,
the stone cut off in his prime could be made chip
in, with some witty remarks on sudden deaths
he d seen, and dear little Arthur (in stone —age 5)
might moralise and let off a hymn and a pious
reflection. The public don’t want to laugh—they
want to creep. The above is new—the idea—not
the corpses. Also, it is creepy—not to say crawly.
The Fearful Summer Heat
m the Australian Back Country
ENERVATES THE STRONGEST MEN AND WOMEN.
An Interesting Case Illustrating the Virtues of Clements Tonic*
THE CASE OF MBS. ANNIE LEESE.
(Reported for “ Redfern Times.”)
'Not far from the Exhibition Building our
reporter found No. 37 George Street,
Redfern, the residence of Mrs. Annie Leese,
a well known fashionable dress maker.
The lady chanced to be at home and
received her visitor with every courtesy.
“I have called on you, Mrs. Leese,” said
the journalist, “ for confirmation of a state-
ment that has reached me :—That fpr a
long time you were a great sufferer from in-
digestion or dyspepsia and made quite a sen-
sational recovery by taking Clement’s Tonic.”
oat is quite true,” replied Mrs. Leese.
“ '' ould you be good enough to give me
the details ? ” asked the reporter.
_ “ Certainly; and you may be sure the
circumstances are such that I am never
likely to forget them. We were living at
Nyngan at the time, a town with a fearful
summer heat and most uninteresting
surroundings. I think these circumstances
combined to start my malady. First the
great heat, next, the want of exercise, for
there was no inducement to go driving or
walking in that bare, monotonous place.
And I am quite aware that in my sedentary
profession somephysicalexerciseisabsolutely
y to preserve good health. My
Bickness came on gradually, and for some
time quite unperceived, and for a good time
after the first symptom of trouble I gave
it no thought or attention—l have always
been careless of myself in that way. At
last the insidious trouble could be no longer
I recognised that I was in a ;
very bad way. My whole digestive system
seemed to be thoroughly disorgan'sed and
run down. After eating, or trying to eat,
I experienced all over niy body a fearful
sense of fulness hard to describe in words.
It was as though up to the throat I was
distended to the point of bursting, a stifling,
straining sensation with pain in the neck.
And on my chest there was a feeling of
great weight as though au immense load
lay there trying to suffocate me. At my
back, between my shoulder blades, there
was a constant dull aching pain, and lower
down there was another intolerable pain ia
the right side below the ribs. But this was
not enough—my cup of misery had to be
filled to the brim ; my head constantly
ached and to my disordered vision all
outward objects seemed to go round and
round in endless revolution. My days and
nights were passed in misery and despair.
Then I would long for food with the desire
of great appetite ; but when it was brought
and waiting for me I could not eat it.
And how I longed for rest, for a good sound
sleep once again, and escape, if only for a
little time, from my pains and miseries ;
but the sleep would not come. Daily I got
steadily worse and worse, my mind filled
with gloom and dreadful forebodings, I
came to that pass as to utterly despair of
myself and the future.”
“ What remedies did"' you seek, Mrs.
Leese ?” encpiired the reporter.
fy“ A doctor treated me for some time,
trying first one thing and then another, but
none of his medicines gave me any
permanent * relief, my malady seeming
altogether beyond his skill. -Then I tried a
variety of remedies so numerous that now I
could not count them. It appeared I was
doomed, that in the whole world nothing
would cure, that my state was beyond
human aid. It chanced one day that my
husband had a fortunate inspiration—he said
to me:—‘Why don’t you try Clements
Tonic? you have heard what a splendid
medicine it is, and what wonderful cures it
has effected; perhaps it would cure you.’ ”
“ And did you take Mr. Leese's advice ? ”
enquired the reporter. , *
“Yes, and thankful I am to say I did,
for when I had purchased a large bottle and
toon after I experienced a wonderful relief
from all my suffering, and a change so
sudden for the better that was hardly
credible to anyone who had not experienced
it. And a 3 I continued taking Clements
Tonic iny serious troubles diminished.
The terrible feeling of inflation, that had
almost stifled me, subsided and troubled me
no more ; the dull pain between my shoulder
blades passed away. My appetite returned
to its normal condition and I could eat and
drink with relish. About the same time
my headache left me, also the disordered
vision that caused all objects in my range
of vision to appear whirling round. Before
taking Clements Tonic the slightest worry
was disti’essing to me, causing violent
headache, arising, without doubt, from my
shattered nervous system ; hut now I was
so braced and strengthened that this
symptom passed with all my other troubles,
and I was once more my old self again.”
“Then I may count you, Mrs. Leese,”
enquired the reporter, “as one of the large"
majority who swear by Clements Tonic,? ”t
¥ “ You may. I know what it can do, and
what it has done. I have constantly
recommended Clements Tonic to my friends
and customers in all cases I thought it
would benefit.”
“ “ May I make this testimony public, Mrs.
Leese? ”
“You are very welcome, and you may
add that I shall be pleased to confirm my
wordstoanyperson whomayread what I have
said, ayd who will take the trouble to call
at my residence.”

Red Bird Crank Bracket.
Found only on
1900 Model
Red Birds.
•As illustrated, the complete bearing is in a steel barrel, which holds the cups
in perfect alignment. Thus the bottom bracket bolts cannot distort the bearing
cups and cause them to run tight. The cups are designed so the axis of the balls
and axle are parallel, and the balls run in a continuous oil bath.
The cranks are secured to axle by means of a hexagon taper, which is further
secured by means of a cap screw.
The cranks cannot possibly work loose as with other forms of attachment.
This is another part where the Red Bird is years in advance.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Interprovincial bantam - scrap, Wal. M‘Kay
(Vic.) against Bert Weekes (N'.S.W.) at Golden Gate A.C.
(Sydney), Saturday night, proved a hashing, hanging,
crashing bout. It lasted 80min. (20 rounds), and was full
of fire the whole time. From the beginning till the fifth
of the term had expired it looked a guinea to a goose-
berry on one, and he the Smellbourne iittle-’un. Bert,
however, came along here with a clatter. Then there
were two in it for a while, and, by-and-bye, only one
again, hut t’other chap now. They stood toe to toe and
poured out thumps heavy and fast. Wal. rushed and
VVeekes uppercut him fiercely and often. Both men
reeled from the force of the punches, but came again
chockful of vim. They got together, hooked, ripped
and swung till the animal in the hundreds of excited
onlookers fairly howled. M’Kay’s optics gave pal-
pable evidence of the wear-and-tear of the fray.
Half-a-dozen times he hung out signals of distress
and seemed on the verge of going under, but grit and
ring-cunning of the highest quality saved him, and he
weathered the storm long enough to recuperate and
make Weekes wince some more. The last round was
fierce ; each made for a knock-out. Close, hot fighting,
clinches and quick breaks occurred a dozen times till the
end, when the referee gave his decision to Weekes, and
the crowd endorsed it.
* • * •
“Old Timer”: Had a look at second match
between Australian top-rung bantams Bert Weekes and
Wal M‘Kay on Saturday night. M‘Kay’s hard old mug
and stockv-built frame were in striking contrast with
Weekes’ tall, lean, fragile-looking figure and boyish face.
On appearances it was any odds against the latter. M‘Kay
hadn’t the condition he had before ; Weekes was better.
M‘Kay was a known quantity to Weekes this time, and
the influence of his long list of 70 battles without a knock
out did not weigh worth a cent, consequently Weekes got
to it charged to the brim with confidence. The gruel
served out on both sides was of the hottest and thickest.
Streaky-formed Bert’s capacity for taking punishment
came as a revelation. Vicious short-arm smashes in the
ribs did little more than shake the attenuated object of
impact up momentarily and leave a big red blot on the
clear white skin. Weekes has the knack of hitting, he hits
straight and quick and consequently hits effectively every
time. He would have been the champion in his division
ten years ago when we had champions here; what must
be said of him now compared with the very poor material
in evidence 1 Worth mentioning that both were weighed
at noon on the day of the fight and each brought the beam
to 7.9 exactly.

Champion 9-stoner Tim Hegarty, and cyclist-
trainer Billy Williams, are matched to fight in Sydney at
9st. 61b. on March 19. Saw Billy have a willing and cor-
dial spar with Otto Cribb at Seale’s Gymnasium on Mon-
day afternoon. Place was filled with sports. Old-man
Billy’s condition was a long way below requirements, but
he shaped well; still it looked as if the flag hail only to go
up and Otto would have outed him. “ Cribb’s too husky
and heavy for me,” said Billy afterwards ; “ but I’ll settle
Hegarty—see if 1 don’t.”

Sydney Bocks crack light-weight “Cocker”
Tweedie, he of the American figures of speech and the
nose-twang, gave a taste of his quality at Melbourne last
week. Willing Jock M'lvor was the subject operated
upon. Jock set a cyclonic gait from “ go.” Brain-
wrecking left jabs in the neighborhood of the breathing
apparatus (during round two) started the gore on both
sides with a lively flow. After that, though Mac kept
coming strong and forcing matters (apparently insensible
to Cocker’s battering) the Sydney man did all the effective
work and scored points till referee (Tut llyan) gave up
reckoning, knowing that nothing but a knock-out would
win for the Victorian bruiser. Jock was spread-eagled
three times in the tenth round, but came up so full of
energy that he managed to lay Tweedie out once. The
uproar here was paralysing. Mac. caught it so hot and
strong in the eleventh round that his back bumped the
boards with a resounding bump thrice successively. Then
the crowd screeched “ Take him away ! ” but he wasn’t
going to be taken away. The gritty Scot was allowed to
stagger, lurch and sprawl till Tweedie got the come-hither
home and laid his man out limp. Ned Cullen will be
Cocker’s next vis-a-vis, and then Tim Hegarty, if Tim is
not otherwise engaged and will waive that weight stipula-
tion.
Yankee mail Moana brings details of the fight
in New York last month between Son-of-Ham Geo. Dixon
and Terry M‘Govern for the bantam-weight champion-
ship of the world. The attendance was enormous.
Money had to be refused. Said that gate reached 24,000
dols., of which sum winner got 9000 and loser 3000.
Promoters, managers and other hangers-on came in for
the balance. M'Govern won in eight rounds. He went
for the body at the outset, sending both hands home with
telling effect. Dixon adopted Englishman Pedlar
Palmer’s methods and played into M‘Govern’s hands by
rushing. The pace was terrific for four rounds.
M‘Govern proved absolutely irresistible ; he bore in
with cyclonic force as strong as a bull and full of
fight. Dixon stood an awful rain of thumps. In the
eighth 3mins. he was a horizontal nigger eight times and
limp, bordering upon lifeless. His manager then skied
the sponge amid a scene of intense excitement.
JPGovern’s latest battle supplies a true line on his go with
the English wonder. Pedlar Palmer, last year. British
sports argued that M'Govern’s win was one of the luckiest
flukes any Yankee ever had. Outcome of the fight, with
the colored phenom. gives matters a different complexion.
Dixon ranked among the cleverest pugs, the world has
seen. He is now in his 30th year, and he has been on the
top rung since 18, while M'Govern won’t be 21 till next
month. Last-named is probably as good already as ever
the black was.

Letters by Monday’s American mail tell that
whilom Australian pug.-marvel and world’s premier
feather, Griffo, has come down with a crash again.
After taking Griff from the lunatic asylum “ Gentle-
man ” George Dawson (also from this quarter)
tended him like a mother, togged his charge in gay
apparel, and sent him away to the hot springs to build
up. Griff met two crack Yanks —Lewis and Kenny—in
quick succession and gave them no hope. Both were
limited-round goes. Frequent flashes of the Sydney
Rocks winder’s old-time brilliancy brought the house
down. As before he didn’t seem capable of landing a
stiff punch on the man he was fighting, but it is equally
true that the man he was fighting couldn’t land any sort
of a punch on him. Later, Griffo got a fat screw' for a
week’s showing in a Chicago theatre, but the adulation of
the push settled him, and, less than a month since, he
was reported in a chronic condition of drunk and alto-
gether beyond pulling round.

The big guns of pugdom — Jim J effries and Jim
Corbett—fight for the world’s supremacy on 15th prox.
First-named says he’ll give sailor Sharkey another chance
a fortnight later, and will take Bob Fitzsimmons on four
weeks afterwards. A huge order this to execute in
12 months —and Jim Jeff talks of doing it in two. Odds
are that Sharkey won’t get another opportunity to maul
and wrench the carcase of the Los Angeles giant, nor will
elongated, auburn-haired Maoriland Bob be allowed to
reverse that very fishy-smelling result of a year ago if
Jeffries can help it, and he’s master of the situation.
* * » *
“ Griff ”: One who knows present bantam
champion pug. of the globe (M'Govern) says he’s a
thinker—he fights his own way, body-blows are his forte,
he is tireless, swift as a tiger, and crafty, and prefers to
shoot a volley of short-arm punches over the heart
in a mix-up. When he dons his verdant togs and
faces an opponent, the modest smile fades into a look
of seriousness which, later, gives way to one of grim
determination. No time or energy is expended in upper-
cutting the atmosphere or pounding the wind ; it’s all
real right down biz. from the jump. He goes for his
man straightway and bangs like a lost soul pounding on
the door of Paradise. Mac. is intuitively a financier.
“ Since I started fighting 2£ years ago,” he said recently,
“ I have made 25,000d01., and am worth 18,000dol. to-day.
Out of my winnings I’ve provided a home for my mother
and my two brothers, and one in Brooklyn for the wife.
Much of the money has been made backing myself. I’ve
never smoked, drunk, or chewed.” The Yankee freak
will probably tackle the feather division after this.
Cheap and nasty novice tourneys are surfeiting
Sydney patrons of the pug. game. Metropolitan and
Golden Gate Associations are running one each now for
the 8.7 section, and giving away 80 sovs. prize-money.
The fighting, as a rule, is of the crudest. Seventy-
five per cent, of the competitors are so unfit that they lie
down, dead to this sphere for the time being, from the
effects of their own futile efforts, rather than the stoush
dealt out by the other man, who, in many cases has no
stoush concealed about him. Few heats extend over two
rounds —most end inside one, and many fail to last half-a-
minute. Clues (only such in name) find novice affairs
exceedingly profitable biz. Money given is trifling as
compared with “gate” realised, for the scrapping sees
several nights through. Worst of it, and what palls more
than aught else, is the fact that the same old adamantine
chivvies and unsocked and dirt-encrusted extremities are
in evidence tourney after tourney, and the same old
ancient odour arises from the cognoscenti always present
on 35., ‘2s. and Is. nights. The prawn-like ones are
away at the “two-up” school, when the tariff is lifted
to 55., 3s. and 2s. for something bearing the imprint
“ extra special.”

N.S.W. nags Blue-Cap and Parthian got home
at Caulfield on Saturday. Former remains in Melbourne
now, having been bought after his race for £l5O by Bal-
larat trainer Scobie. W.f.a. race St. George Stakes proved
a veritable gift for the Grand Flaneur—Arclieress 3-year-
old Parthian, who came home eight lengths to the good,
absolutely on his own. He looked about the most
solitary horse in creation. That arch-deceiver Bobadil
started first favorite and pulled up behind the whole
field. May be that Bobby has seen his day, but
writer doesn’t think so ; he must have put up something
out of the way to find So much support. Parthian is now
a boiling-hot favorite for the Australian Cup, wherein he
will hump 8.7, and looks unusually good. Five to one is
the best offer against him. Owner “ Tom ” Muir bought
the whilom Chipping-Norton nag at V.1t.0. Spring meet-
ing from chairman “ Bill ” Long, of the A.J.C., for lfoOgs.,
and has won two good races with him since. Said that
Parthian will go to England ultimately, but just now he
has engagements in Australian Cup, V.R.O. St. Leger,
Champion Stakes, and A.J.C. St. Leger to fill. He was
bred at llobartville (N.S.W.), where La Belle-Seneschal
colt. Bar One (half-brother to the sensational Marvel, and
winner of two-year-old race at Rosehill, Sydney, Saturday),
first saw the light.

Pilgrim’s Progress—Zeph colt Palmer’s win of
rich Futurity Slakes (200.0 sovs.) at Caulfield, on Saturday,
was about as big a reversal of form as has been sprung
upon the longsuffering punter lately. He ran almost last
in Oakleigh Plate a week before, when Isaac Mo would have
allowed you to name your own odds about him. He
might not have given you the odds after you named them
for I. Mo has reserves of caution, but he would have let
you name them right enough. Seven to 1 was the best
available on Saturday—a ton of money going on. St.
Albans 2-year old Kinglike, by Wallace—Bonnie Rosetta
went out favorite but could get no nearer than fourth
—Olaf filling second and Songbird third positions. Present
owner, young Jimmy Wilson, bred Palmer and trained
him privately at Queenscliff, that quarter noted for dark
’uns. Melbourne Cup winner, Merriwee, frinstans. Which
reminds writer—turf scribes are telling about it having
“ leaked out ” that Merriwee’s Australian Cup chance is
none too good, the nag having “gone off.” But backers
shouldn’t he scared —nothing “ leaks out’’from Queens-
cliff that isn’t wanted to leak.
• * * *
“Tote”: He Bulletin par, 10/2/’OO, concerning
Saraswati-The Watchdog biz at Warwick Farm (N.S.W.)
previous Saturday and consequent greasing of that
already very fat sow, the shop double-layer. Something
similar happened at Bushmen’s Contingent Races (Rand-
wick) Friday last; also, same two nags and owner were
involved. This time the double—The Watchdog and War
God—had been backed in shops ; not Saraswati and War
God as at Warwick Farm. Saraswati and The Watchdog
were let loose in Contingent Handicap. The Watchdog was
heavily wagered on at fives, while Saraswati went to tne
post a rank outsider (Tucka Tucka Smith is said to have
won 200 to 10 about him), yet Saraswati finished half a
neck in front of his stable chum who came as if fired from
a catapult, but came just too late. If time (1.14) may be
accepted, The Watchdog’s Newmarket chance looks par-
ticularly rosy, as he was one of the last to get away and,
at the end, shot out from almost nowhere. Saturday at
Rosehill (Sydney) races Saraswati, humpingOlbs. less than
it won with on Friday, started a red-hot 6 to 4 favorite for
Sprinters’ Handicap over same distance as Contingent
Handicap and finished about last in a field of nine and in
2sec. slower time than that put up the day before.
The bookmaker is a hard-faced person, with a
business jaw. The average backer, when he has a
win, opens out and plunges, but the more a booky
wins the less he is inclined to take risks. At Rose-
hill, on Saturday, after four consecutive red-hot favorites
had gone down—in two cases to unbacked outsiders—the
books' opened out on the February Handicap and reck-
lessly volunteered to “ take ” 5 to 4 about St. Clare, or
bet 4 to 1 bar one. The public backed St. Clare at this
price, and Bombshell, an outsider, straightway went out
and won the event amidst much joyous yell from the
Ring. Then the books cheerfully cried—“ I’ll pay this
winner 1 ” (they always loudly offer to “ pay this winner ”
when there’s no paying to speak of to do—otherwise
they keep quiet) and offered open-heartedly to lay 3 to 1
bar two for the Final Welter.
But the most surprising case of “remarkable im-
provement ” in a horse Sydney has seen for months is
that of Aberdare, winner of the hurdle events at Rand-
wick and Rosehill on Friday and Saturday last. About a
month ago Aberdare started in a hurdle race at Canter-
bury and labored in a long last, Tiie Bulletin at the time
referring to him as an “ indescribable quadruped,” and
commenting on his feebleness. In that short month,
however, he has built up into, despite his fiddle-head, a
really good stamp of a horse, and has developed a whirl-
wind.finish, his end-up when he downed old John Rid at
Randwick being brilliant. Aberdare won’t want to im-
prove at this rate much longer to get near Grand National
form.
* * * *
The Boer who catches Uproar, the winner of
the Bushmen’s Contingent double at Randwick on Friday
last, will need to be mounted on a good bit of stuff.
Uproar won the first race, carrying list., in the excellent
time of lmin. 20sec. ; and in the second event, carrying
the steadier of 12st. 101 b., he ran his six furlongs in
lmin. 21sec. A. Battye, the old-time crack horseman
who goes with the contingent, had the mounts on Wan-
garah and Wyalong West, both red-hot favorites, but he
could only run second in each instance to the speedy
Uproar.
• * • *
Uproar is rather well-known to Sydney pony-
race followers, who invested on him on Friday
to a man. Uproar promised big things amongst the
dog - sized horses until the Kensington stewards
decided to give him a spell. The spectacle of a
disqualified pony winning a “ superiah ” A.J.O. double is
interesting. Apropos of aforesaid Bushmen’s events, the
horsemanship of the common privates was noticeably
superior to that of the officers. Uproar was beautifully
handled in the first event by Private Walker, and there
was nothing wrong with Sydney poloist Lieut. “ Billy ”
Cope’s steering of him to the van in the Commandeer
Plate, but the efforts of the spangled ofHcers-in-general
were not brilliant. One of them, on a good sort of nag,
had a go at Uproar opposite the stand, but stopped
flogging to fix his cap on straight.

Bar One, winner of the Nursery Handicap at
Rosehill on Saturday, is a remarkably promising half-
brother to the great Marvel, lie is a brown colt, big, but
a regular baby, whinnying in the paddock like a great,
over-grown foal, and spreading himself round promiscu-
ously when galloping. When the pressure was p >
however, he finished straight as a dart, and nalloped
what there was to beat in great style, although he was
carrying a cwt. too much condition.

Kelso’s cast-off old brown gelding, The Captain,
by Robinson Crusoe —Marie Louise, came mirier the
hammer in Sydney t’other day, and was knocked down
at 17gs. He will probably end his days between the
shafts of a cab or something worse—but, then, there is
nothing worse. The ancient nag, with Sam Cook s colors
up, won at the first time of asking—nine years ago-. He
has figured in 150 races since, and only scored 11 times.
In 24 starts (season ’97-’9B), The Captain never got home
once, and, last season, onlv landed the loot twice out of
35 runs. Looks as if the old chap is going to have a cut
at meetings outside the pale ; he was entered for a four-
furlongs event at Forest Lodge (Sydney) recently. 1' : , tn (N

“Tassy”: A steeplechase run at Chudleigh
(Tas.) lately produced some old-timers. Winner was 14

remarkable that “ leppers” last so long on the turf.

ened up, means his Highness the Maharaja of Patiala.
When this potentate travels his initials are brought after
him by freight train. He is 28, keen as the keenest on
sport, and a reported top-rate horseman. He owns an
immense stable of racers, hacks and hunters, and is
a mighty pig-sticker before the Lord. ’Twas Patiala
that recently presented a high-class Arab charger to Lord
Bobs. In addition to his other qualifications, he is

“Scrip” : Reason why so many small owners
don’t know where next week’s oats are to come from is
that their gallopers are only mediums, and they’re not
clever enough to “ place ” them properly. Also, some so-
called trainers should be scavenging instead of handling
frisky thoroughbreds. Know a man who served me with
milk nine months ago—been in the cow business all his
life —now set up as a public trainer. He says : “ Send
’em round,” and round they go ; the boy jockey does it
all. Owners are satisfied apparently.
M.L. punters who operate with the irrepressible
“ walking tote ” do so when two horses
belonging to one owner are bracketed on the legalised
machine. Latter pays out on both ; the walking gent on
the winner only.

A very dressy individual of affluent appearance
sauntered up to a fashionable jockey on an Australian
course the other day, and asked about his mount’s chance
in next race. Jockey winked his blind eye, and inquired
if he would “ stand in ”if he gave a good tip. Agreed to.
Told inquirer to back, say, Nobbier for all he was worth.
“My moke,” he said, effusively, “is stiff.” The good
thing came off with satisfactory financial results. But
that jock never rode his own mount again ; it happened
to belong to the dressy person, who raced under the rose,
and who also changed his trainer forthwith.
A good field went out for the chief event (15
bags) at a Maori oats-meeting a while back, a noted brown
man’s horse being a hot favorite. It got beaten by
a neck, and the Maori judge said, “ Nummer seven win.”
But the owner of the g’ood thing, a six-footer of ferocious
aspect, yelled—“ No fear ! My horse win ” ; and the
crowd capsized the cart which did duty for a “ box.”
Then the judge admitted he was wrong. But that night,
when the brown men were drinking, the owner of No. 7
stole the oats and sold them to an adjacent fanner, and
there was so much trouble that it has been decided to
strike the 15-bag' event off the programme in future.

In the hurdle-race at the Bushmen’s Contingent
meeting at Randwick, Havelock was a hot favorite, but
after fighting for his head for the best part of the journey
he died away to nothing before entering the straight.
Coming for home, John Rid looked all over a winner, but
Aberdare cut him down and made an easy win. On the
following day, at Rosehill (Sydney), the public made John
Rid, who was on 61b. better terms with Aberdare, a strong
favorite again at 6 to 4, but Aberdare ran much the same
race, and beat John in the run home.

In Sydney “club” cricket on Saturday, Pad-
dington put up a good performance by getting rid of
Central Cumberland for 106, but C.O. put up a better one
by gathering in 6 Paddington wickets for 72. Trumper,
Noble, and Mackenzie, for the latter club, only knocked
up 23 among them. “Hopeless Alick’s” share being-
nil. Mary Ann Noble, however, collected 6 C.O. wickets
for 39, and Trumper snared 4 for 58. It isn’t often that
these two players make an all-round failure. In other
matches, East Sydney compiled 256 against last year’s
cracks, North Sydney ; W. Camphin, a sturdy bat, getting
69 of them. Hopkins, for North Sydney, got 5 for 75.
The improving Leichhardt colts got rid of Waverley for
218, to which smiter Percy Pemell subscribed 76, and
Syd. Gregory a “ blob.” Leichhardt lost 3 wickets for 61,
ex-tennis-champion Curtis knocking up 20 not out
prettily. Redfern heaped up 282 against the hopeless
Burwood team, Arthur Hanigan brutally assaulting the
ball for 05.

Jack Lyons reckons that he will be jigging again
next year. “ I’ll be up with the best of ’em,” says

varicose veins, and athletes may as well aim the sponge

but bis injured side is still a source of trouble, and he
can’t handle a bat at present.

splendid phy 7 sique and have seen something of the bush.
Their cycle ride from Mount Magnet to Melb., a couple of

ley must come out atop twice to achieve that distinction.

Five - hundred yards swimming supremacy of
the Cornstalk province, at Bronte (Sy 7 dney), Saturday
went to boy Dick Cavill, who swam superbly, and
touched the finish with three yards of the fluid you mix
with your whisky between himself and Craig (220yds.
champion of the continent). Craig was eight yards away
from Bond (owner of the J-mile anrl 1-mile premiership of
N.S.W. and Victoria respectively). Time (0. 52 1-5) is
a new best for this section. Freddy 7 Lane’s 6. 59 2-5 pre-
viously held pride of place. For purposes of comparison
may be mentioned that the world’s amateur fastest is
6.45, and professional 6.28). Cavill could have travelled a
bit quicker had it been necessary, but it wasn’t. All
three men placed finished inside standard—7.s.

Sydney League of Wheelmen’s acetylene-gas
contests ended Monday 7 night. A big crowd rolled up.
Jackson (Vic.), from scratch, got away with the final of
the Bushmen’s wheel race, with Rowlands (S.A.), 100yds.,
second, and Joe Megson (N.S.W.), scratch, third. Inches
only separated the trio. M.L. champion Sutherland
annexed “The Chenhall ” (named after a Sydney solicitor
who dabbles a bit in the game) mile from scratch, bril-
liantly 7 beating Bob Walne (Q.), also on the same mark,
by 7 20yds. Cobar (N.S.W.) Larry Corbett (75yds.) was a
good third. “Muskett” 10-miles scratch race—the big
event—fell to the colored Victorian crack, Gordon, who
finished as if fired at Kruger from a gun. Jackson was
6yds off second, just licking R. Lewis. All three hail
from the same province. Time, 24 33 2-5.

Champion cyclist E. Reynolds, picked to repre-
sent M.L. at Paris, walked off with the one, three, and
five-mile cash events at League of Maoriland’s champion-
ship meeting t’other day ; while brother W. Rey nolds
secured the three and ten mile amateur championships.
Reynolds the elder is in great form just now.
The much-boomed pedalling game has decayed
greatly in M.L. The admixture of pro. and lily-white
amateur racing is suggested as the cause. Taking them
all round, too, the pros, are a comparatively poor lot,
and the public won’t pay to see “ arranged ” races. Last
championship meeting was a sick affair, both from a
racing and attendance view point.

A by-law passed by Christchurch (M.L.) Coun-
cil has elicited some very breezy observations. C.vclists
must toll bell when meeting or overtaking another cyclist,
or a pedestrian, horse, or vehicle, and when crossing
streets. They mustn’t “ ride without handles ” —a knock
at conceited prigs who bowl along with hands off handle-
bar —and short-cuts round corners are prohibited, a
graceful curve being demanded. Apologies for lights
will be severely sat on ; real good lighthouse affairs are
wanted. The Cathedral City 7 is now a tinkling hell, and
action is to be taken against demonstrative bikists whose
clanging of large dinner-bells has brought them under
the category of public nuisances.

“Reo” writes: “C.M.G.” (B. 10/2/’OO) won-
ders why cyclists don't get killed by their fa.ls when
racing. Answer—condition. Same with jockeys. Let
an average man fall from a horse and he spends a term in
bed, but a jockey can have a horse roll over him and
bruise him from head to foot, and, bar a broken bone, he
is right in two or three days.

“Melb.” : At the A.N.A. fete, I stepped up to
the Exhibition dome by night. Perhaps the only 7 cities
with a more central view-point of elevation are Boston,
from the gilded cupola of the State House, up to wliiph
everything slopes, and Milan, where the cathedral is such
another hub, similarly visible from all points of the com-
pass. At night the Exhibition dome, buried in air, was
above me, while all around was the ocean of lights, and
the strains of music welled up from beneath. How sur-
passingly beautiful was the view of the Coliseum, so to
speak, below, electric-lighted, with its thousands of spec-
tators, and a dozen cyclists, in jockey colors, whizzing
round in a cluster. Tyres on the asphalt sound at that
distance rather like the patter of the hoofs of racers on
the turf, though more subdued.

recognising that motor-paced contests are popular with
the public, have inserted a 3 Miles Paced Tournament in
their programme of sports, to be held .at the Melbourne
Exhibition building at Easter time. The best of our
cracks will be invited, and the fact that a big prize will be
given to the winner will produce a struggle between
Messrs. Walne, Martin, Jackson, Beauchamp, Sutherland
and Mutton that should be worth travelling miles to see.
The tournament will be paced by the Dunlop motors,
which gave such an interesting exhibition at the recent

“ The Pelican ” sends a sporting item : Saw some
unique sports t’other day at Golden Lyre Hotel. The
tournament was snakes versus men. First event was a
flat race, straight course, 80 links long. Combo, an
“even time” nigger of the district, was favorite, though a
fine specimen of tiger snake almost shared the honor.
The race is easily described. For 40 links Combo led, but
the effort was too much, the “ tiger ” outstaying him and
winning a desperately contested race on the post. Both
competitors were completely exhausted. The three

Will any Australian ever repeat Geo. Giffen’s
great feat of heading both batting and bowling on an
English tour? The most likely emulator is Noble, as
Crumble is getting old, and his muscles must be stiffen-
ing. Vet even Noble’s chance isn’t promising, as he is an
erratic bowler, and the Britishers can puli his slow stuff.
All this shows that the Giffen gap in Australian cricket
hasn’t yet been filled. It is only when a champion retires
that his value can be adequately estimated.
The next English team will probably be without
some of the men lovers of the game hoped to see. Major
Poore, who headed last season's averages, and C. B. Fry,
who performed so well against Darling and Co., have gone
to South Africa, the latter with the Imperial Yeomen ;
Capt. Wynyard is under orders ; Fox, the Oxford wicket-
keeper, has been bitten with the fever, and enlisted
in the 6th Dragoons ; Lord Harris has also volunteered,
and, it is to be hoped, will be satisfied with Kruger’s
umpiring. Likewise, it is cabled that, owing to the war,
the proposed tour is off for the present.

The Britishers and their institutions die hard..
Mr. Arthur Coventry, the English starter, is still sceptical

anxious to prove themselves unwise prophets.

At an evening entertainment once in a small Lanark-
shire (Scotland) town a very mild amateur tenor made a
wild attempt at “My Pretty Jane.” An old farmer was
asked what he thought of it. “No bad,” he replied,
“ but a h’ard ane Sims Reeves sing it, doou in Glesca, an’
he wiz fully as entertainin’.”
When the Italian Opera Co., which the late Martin
Simonsen brought here about the beginning of ’B7, was
voyaging from Sydney to Melbourne, the steamer, on
rounding Wilson’s Promontory, shipped one or two seas.
The tenor Lazzarini was observed standing at the saloon
companion, looking very pale and forlorn. Someone
asked him if he was sick. “ No,” he replied, “I no seek.
My vife seek. I frightened..”
Charles Arnold when last heard from was about to play
“ What Happened to Jones ” in Capetown, and had
announced his intention to take the co. to Kimberley
before leaving for Australia. Probably the next announce-
ment will be that Arnold has decided not to play in
Kimberley owing to the prevalence of the Boer plague
north of the Modder River.
Thus a Poverty Pointer to a Bum.etix man:—“Of
course, actors, not having ‘ stiddy jobs ’as a rule, and
being an improvident crowd that stays out late at night,
frequently falls into arrears at hotels'and places, and give
Mrs. Landlord worry and sleepless nights. But I particu-
larly object to the continual assumption that the landlady
of the actor’s hash-entrenchment is a tough case with a
heart of old red sandstone, who locks up "the backward
artist’s trousers, or holds his person pending settlements.
As a matter of fact, I have found them all the other wav.
Here is a case in point. I was staying at a house in Carl-
ton last year, and was soon a month behind, and promis-
ing to increase the delay indefinitely. Did my landlady
lock me up, or take steps to hold my belongings ? Not a
bit of it. Four nights running I noticed a ladder reared
against the wall under my window. On the fifth night I
took the hint. Now, the juxtaposition of that ladder and
my window was no accident; it was a polite intimation,
and if I ever have a fortune left me by ,1 11 pay that
woman, if only as a reward for her exquisite delicacy.”
Barry Sullivan, the tragedian, held himself in high
esteem. A super, in the old Theatre Roval, Melbourne,
having offended him, was dismissed. The wretched man
fell on his knees before the theatrical magnate and begged
for mercy. “Kneel not to me,” said the lordly actor,
“ but to one ” (pointing to the heavens) “ who, perhaps,
is mightier even than I.”
When Louise Pomeroy, the American actress, was per-
forming at Melbourne Royal, she was greatlv smitten
with the charms of curly-pated Herbert Flemming.
One night she fainted between the acts. Some friends
gathered round her and anxiously debated as to whether
they should send for a doctor. The fair tragedienne
instantly revived and said with considerable asperity :
“ Certainly not; send for the man with the god-like
head ! ” And they all knew the individual she required.
Herr Bandmann—-the Gennan actor who lately pursued
the plain red cow over the fragrant hills of Cali ornia—
was fond of carrying a sharp-pointed sword instead of the
ordinary stage implement. In the last act of “ Othello ”
he once attacked Emilia (Mrs. Steele) with such vigor that
the weapon entered the lower part of her back, eliciting
screams which made some of the audience rise, and fly
from the premises. She recovered from her injuries in a
few days, Imt it was a narrow escape and Bandmann was
a badly-terrified German for a minute or two.
About 17 years ago, when the advt. of the person “with
a view to the above ” was less common than it is in these
times, a now well-known actor was stranded in a cold and
holy Maori land city, and desperately hard-up. The only
visible way to raise the wind was by getting up a big
benefit to himself, and the cold and fioly place didn't, i s
a rule, spend much money on benefits. But he raked tl e
people in by this wicked device : An agony advt.—almost
the first of the kind in these parts—was inserted in tl e
local cause of public gloom—** Young lady, handsome,
plenty of means, desires to meet young man.' Matrimony
no dial object." The last clause might mean anything or
nothing, but the local pietists assumed that" it meant
everything, and rose in fury, and it blew a gale of shocked
he-cats down Princes-street. There were indignant letters
in the local press, and the curse that was delivered from
the local pulpit isn’t quite cool yet. But the answers
rolled in, among them letters from local magnates and
preachers. They all “desired interview.” The wily one
replied to them all, making an appointment in the circle
of the theatre on his own benefit-night, till he saw the
circle would hold no more. Then he made appointments
with the rest in the stalls. And he had a great benefit—
one that the holy city remembers to this day.
Some people won’t be content with less than the Uni-
verse. A couple of years back Barnum and Bailee's
** Greatest Show on Earth ” was formed into a companv,
with a nominal capital of £4l)o,orxi, and for some time
found a happv hunting ground in the provinces of the
United Kingdom. In 1S!)S the profits were £113,343-
more than 25 per cent ; but in 1899 a long continuance of
bail weather brought them down to £37,428. This
paltry dividend of about 9 per cent, was not good enough
for the directors and shareholders, so they are going to
try Germany this year. They won’t have it all their own
way there though, for Germany has always been strong in
circuses. Writer remembers the two big Berlin circuses—
Renz’s and Salamonski’s—with their double, and even
treble, companies, so that one could go on successive
evenings and see each time a different performance. It
was nothing out of the way to see 100 horses standing idle
in their stables.
Not generally known that local scenic artist, Brunton,
is an expert swordsman. When he was assistant to Wm.
Glover, at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, they used fre-
quently to appear together in the duel scene of the Cor-
sican Brothers—Brunton’s Chateau Renaud to Glover’s
Fabien—and their fencing was a thing to remember.
Two notable deaths in the English theatrical world at
Xmas time were the passing hence of pretty Dorothy
Dene and Mat Robson. The latter, a good low comedian,
with a one-time comic “catch” in his throat (a trick
never quite reproduced by his numerous imitators), was
the son of the original Robson, the man whom all the old
identities swore by when Johnny Toole was still a young
favorite. Toole, at his best, was said to be but a poor
successor to Robson in characters of the Paul Pry and
serio-comic class.
The war has been a godsend to some small theatrical
people who had the good luck to be in the Transvaal
when hostilities commenced. One or two persons more
or less connected with the stage sought the bubble advt.
by being “ murdered by the Boers ” while endeavoring to
get out of the country m order to fulfil engagements else-
where at stupendous salaries, and declared themselves
afterwards quite unable to imagine how the reports got
about. _ One of the “ horrid Boer murders ” which caused
spine wild Australian Jingoes to demand the public execu-
tion of the Boer leaders when captured by way of satis-
faction was only the harmless, unavoidable puff of an
American funny man named Charles Edwards. Edwards,
who is now pkyinjf in London, got himself stain in an
extra-stupendous manner, and his mangled remains
appeared in English cablegrams.
Cora Urquhart Potter’s doctor haB made her give rip
reciting at the London Empire. The tobacco-smoke, she
says, irritates the eyes, nose, and throat of an artist. It

out.

“Melb.”: The tedious tussle of the dramatic elocu-
tionary and musical contests of the A.N.A. has evoked
some genuine talent. Heading the reciters, Eileen
O’Mara, a budding vision of loveliness, with a hayrick of
magnificent tumbled hair a little too much over her eyes,
showed that she also possessed a mind directly she ojieiied
the gates of her mouth and persuaded her sweet voice to
walk out of them—look at that now I Also, Miss Burrows
flung- herself into Juliet in a moment. But the daring and
dashing soliloquy was that of the girl Smith, who out-
Geciled Ward in declaiming a bit of D’Artagnan. The sing-
ing tournament evoked Lily' Henr.v, who swept the board.
A smallish, ungrown, straw-haired, Johnny Coleman-look-
ing girl, her deep contralto was like a hammer on a bell.
Another Crossley in embryo, though her organ, like
Regina Nagel’s, has a painful Australian quality of mono-
chrome, the essence of Marcus Clarke’s Melancholy of the
Bush. I don’t like it, but it hits hard. There" is in it
somewhat of the bullock-bell. On the piano, a sort of
really gifted Crummies’s infant phenomenon, named
Hilda Baker, tackled the “Caprice Aerien” with all the
assurance and intelligence of an Arabella Goddard. Miss
Cussen’s “ Saltarelle ” was an example to show that the
girls don’t all carry about only mackintoshes and goloshes
and cray'fish in violin-cases.
The Newskv troupe comprises Zinaida Londowitsch,

healthy.
“ F.” puts in his curse :—“ Simonsen did not discover
Harding. Riccardi it was who induced him to join him
in the production of the ‘ Sorcerer,’ which was followed
by ‘ Pinafore,’ first production anywhere south of the
line. Charlie was only 4!) when he died. lie was never
voted ‘ not too bad ’ in Auckland ; he was worshipped
there, and had the purest baritone in the world till he
‘forced it up’ to sing tenor parts. Riccardi used to be-
seech him not to spoil ‘the best baritone I ever heard,’
but he went his own gait. In style and appearance a born
Don Csesar, he could only sing the music by using the
’ head notes.’ Had Wallace made the rollicking Don a
baritone Harding w'ould have kept ‘Maritana’ alive as
long as he lived to sing in it.”
Johnnie Sheridan advts. in Melb. dailies the other week.
“Did you ever see John Sheridan and Gracie Whiteford
in tragedy ? No, their names are associated with bright,
pleasant, sparkling,” etc., etc. And yet Sheridan’s Lady
Macbeth would probably be more amusing than anything
he has .yet done.
“ F.” : Tom Fitz Gerald’s great unhappiness will be that
he can’t send “hob” wires all over Australia from ’Ome.
Flash Tom n. ver writes a letter : he is too lazy, and then
a wire looks 1.-eehanded. He will spend 15s. on a wire to
convey some information that can keep for a month, and
that one page of letter-paper would carry for twopence,
and then economise the rest of the day. Telegrams are
his one wild extravagance, riot, bust, and all the rest.
He is a telegram-drunk. Dan, on the contrary, neither
writes nor wires—he just comes. And Daniel would give
the boots off his feet to anyone he was told he once knew,
and do it secretly, as if it was a crime.
The breezy letters of “Banjo ” Paterson,
in S.M. Herald, stand easily first in interest
among Australian press correspondence from the
seat of war. And their (to put it mildly) non-
Jingo tone is so noticeable that the public is some-
what astonished to find them printed in such a
quarter. When at Capetown “Banjo” visited
the world-famous Olive Schreiner, sister of the
Cape Premier and authoress of “ The Story of
an African Farm,” whom he found to be dark,
short, strongly-built, brisk, and bright-eyed. Mr.
Paterson proceeds :
It may be news to many Australians to hear that in the
Cape Colony there are more people against the war than
for it, not necessarily Boer sympathisers, but people who
think that the war should never have been entered upon.
When our troops landed from Australia we were as-
tonished to find that the Cape Colony was so much
against the war. The local papers that were for the war
were all clamoring for the arrest or dismissal of Schreiner,
the Premier, but when the House went to a division
Schreiner had a majority behind him, and Schreiner has
always declared that England is not justified in this war.
Olive Schreiner was not long in stating her views to the
present writer. She talks rapidly and energetically, em-
phasising her remark's with ' uplifted finger. “ You
Australians and New Zealanders and Canadians,” she
said, “ I cannot understand it at all, why you come
here light - heartedly to shoot- down other colonists
of whom you know nothing —it is terrible. Such
fine men too —fine fellows. I went to Green Point and
saw your men in camp ; oh, they were fine men—(These
were Colonel Williams’s A.M.O. troops)—and to think
that they are going out to kill and be killed, just to please
the capitalists 1 There was one officer—oh, a fine man, so
like a Boer, he might have been a Boer commandant.
[This was no doubt the burly, blue-eyed Surgeon-Colonel
Williams.—Ed. B.J It is terrible—such men to come and
fight against those fighting for their liberty and then-
country. The English Tommy Atkins goes where he is
sent—he fights because he is ordered ; but you people—
you are all volunteers ! Why have you come ? . . . You
say that England was at war, and you wish to show the
world that when the mother country got into a war the
colonies were prepared to take their place beside her?
Yes, but you ought to ask, you ought to make inquiries
before you come over. You Australians do not under-
stand. This is a capitalists’ war ! They want fio get con-
trol of the Rand and the mines. You have nothing
like it in your country. You have a working-class
that votes, and that cannot be bought to vote
against its own interests ; but, in the Transvaal,
there are just a handful of Boer fanners, a small, but
enormously wealthy, mine-owning class and their depen-
dents—professional men, shopkeepers, and so on, and the
rest are all kattirs.” “Why didn’t the Boers grant the
franchise?” “It was not really wanted. I was in
Johannesburg a few months before the war broke out,
and hundreds of men there said they would not forego
their British nationality for the sake of voting as a Boer.
They are all nomads, wanderers, over there to make
money, and if Oom Paul had gone on his knees and asked
them to accept the franchise they would not have
accepted it. They would not relinquish being British
subjects. But the capitalists insist on getting hold of the
mines, and all the white people are so concerned with
them, their interests so depend on the mine-owners, that
they must go along with them, and now they want the
franchise to take control of the mines from the Boers. It
is a monstrous war, and England will regret it ;
is it just to take the country from the Boers for the
benefit of the speculators? For years this war has been
worked up—all sorts of stories have been printed of the
Boers and their ignorance and their savagery. They are
all lies. I was a governess among the Boers for years, and
no kinder people exist. They are clever, too. Young
Boers go to England and succeed at the Universities ;
they become doctors and lawyers and politicians. It is
much like Australia from what I have read. They are
such hospitable people. Oh, this war is a terrible thing ;
it will be a war of extermination.” “ What do you think
will be the end of it?” “ There will be no end. The Boers
are fighting for life or death, and they have no idea of giv-
ing in. If they are beaten back into the Free State and
the Transvaal that is just the time they will be most dan-
gerous. When the English get to Pretoria with their
army they will then be in a worse position than they are
now. They will have hundreds and hundreds of miles of
railway line to defend, and even if the Boers are scattered
and beaten, they will still fight. The Boer women
now are heart and soul for the war. The Boer
farmer is a curious man. He marries earlv,
usually about IS or 19, and there is not one
man in the army against you but has his wife and child
somewhere. And those wives and children are reaping
the crops and working the farms, so that their husbands
can go to the war. After Elandslaagte, where the Boers
were defeated, one Boer went home. His wife said,
‘ What has happened ; are you wounded?’ ‘No.’ ‘ls
the enemy fled?’ ‘No.’ ‘Well, back you go to the
laager, and fight with the rest.’ Another old man, of 75,
when he heard of the defeat, rose up and took his rifle.
‘I am going to the front,’ he said. ‘ Why, you cannot
see,’ said his grandchildren. ‘ I cannot see at iOOO yards,’
he said, ‘ but I can see well enough at 100 ;’ and off he went
in a Cape cart as he was too old to ride. The small boys
at school at the Capetown schools have all been brought
back to the farms to fight—boys of 14 and 15 are in
the ranks. And all of these people have their
relatives all through Cape Colony; and they are to
be butchered, and the English soldiers are to be
butchered, to suit a few capitalists. It will benefit no
one else. The effect of this war on South Africa will be
everlasting; we have such a large population here who
feel that the war is unjust, and they will never forgive
the English people for forcing it on. ‘ Perhaps the memory
of Majuba Hill had a good deal to do with it? I cannot
think so—the English are not so narrow as to treasure up
memories of a small thing like that. But now it is a long,
terrible war that is before us, and the Boers will be more
dangerous after a few reverses. A few defeats will not
crush them ! When the English get to Pretoria then
there will begin the trouble.” Whatever may be the cor-
rectness of Olive Schreiner’s views' there is no doubt of
her sincerity She says openly what most, or at any
rate very many, South Africans think, arid it is
always well to hear both sides, so I have put down
without comment exactly what her views were.
After an interview with her one comes away with a much
more lively and human interest in “ orir friends the
enemy.” If tilings are as she says, if the Boers are going
to make it a war to the bitter end, then England has a
sorry task before her. If the Boers scatter and break to
the mountains they will be practically' unreachable, and
the English people are too humane to care about levying
reprisals by destroying their homesteads and leaving their
wives and children without shelter. The result will be
that even after the war is over a large force will have to
be kept in the country to maintain order, and with the
Cape disaffected there will be serious trouble for poli-
ticians after the soldiers have got through with their
work. One is more inclined to hope that after a defeat
or two the Boer, sensible man that he is, will come in
under English rule, and rely on the forbearance of that
Power rather than maintain a hopeless struggling fight
which will only prolong the misery of the present war.
THE MODERN COLOSSEUM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This world’s a theatre. Just now
The stage is set beyond the water,
Whereon the actors make their bow.
The play’s entitled “ Awful Slaughter.”
To make your nerves all crawl and creep,
The play each day with horror hits you;
And then the prices are so cheap—
A penny every day admits you.
Two hundred thousand actors fight
On plains and kopjes, camps and trenches ;
The slaughter goes on day and night,
And blood the wide arena drenches.
It’s very sad and very bad,
But as war never will be missed hence,
You take it, as ’tis to be had,
To give a spice to your existence.
You wonder what the troops will do,
And what will be the General’s caper }
It gives a pleasant interest to
The cables in your daily paper.
You have a friend who rushed pell-mell
To volunteer, and off has trotted ;
And, though, of course, you like him well,
You speculate il he’ll lie potted.
With slaughter here and slaughter there,
And more to come, you fill your head full:
You like to see your paper bear
The message of the penny dreadful.
If Boers slaughtered all they took,
Twould horrify the British nation ;
But think how sweet ’twould be to book
The tingle of each huge sensation.
And when to Fate the Dutchmen bow
We’ll offer up a loud Te Deum,
And pray God for another row
To fill our modern Colosseum.
BINDYL.


About eight yebrs ago, a bouse in a Mel-
bourne suburb (portion of a property then in liti-
at P™ e ) tell into tho occupation of a
daughter of joy who. until the other day, lived
fiLL^\V re 1l ob °ay,being legally entitled to
But, now that the aforesaid litigation
13 ended, a Melb. lawyer, armed with power of
attorney, undertook the job of eviction with a
storming party of one policeman, two bailiffs, one
solici tor s cleric, and one estate - agent’s ditto,
•trouble being anticipated from the lydias’ “gintle-
min funds, one of the bailiffs, a seasoned old
warrior with a game leg, was sent on in advance
to -Knock the door, and, as soon as it was
opened, up rushed the others and commenced to
haul the furniture out into the street. Meanwhile,
the damsel w\o had opened the door gave the
alarm, and soon a battle-royal was raging in the
hall and front parlor. The “gintlemin frinds”
hadn t turned up, but the defence was neverthe-
less m capable hands. Crockery, chairs, tables
and pictures flew around merrily, while the
lawyer a clerk struggled on the floor under a large
and violent female, who pounded him till he
howled for mercy. The crowd that quiokly
gathered cheered both sides impartially until
the combatants paused for breath, whereupon
the lydies attempted to effect by blandish-
ment what valor had failed to accom-
plish. But out they had to go, and, having
nowhere in particular to make for, they proceeded
. hold an auction of their ejected chattels.
Bidding was brisk, and, as soon as a few articles
had been sold, one of the lydies was despatched
for liquid refreshments. At intervals, the per-
spiring garrison would heave out another bed or
washstand, to be also put promptly under the
hammer. Every moment the fun waxed more
furious, and the crowd increased until the entire
street was blocked. At last the bobby, who had
retired to report, returned with another constable
and a cab, and the whole bevy of now wildly
hilarious Totties were run-in for being disorderly
and for not having an auctioneer’s license.

To Here Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and 1 sent for some of your ALFA LINE
REME 1)1 E<, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two years ago.
I also t- ; ed your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which eomp.etely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALKALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, hut to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN.

Dear Sir. —I can truthfully assert that since using your

constituents, and 1 will do the same to all whom I hear
complaining of rheumatic attacks. With kind regards,
I have the honor to be, yours truly,

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,—Having suffered for some time from a com

advice, with no effect, I one day was fortunate enough to
pick up one of your books in the bush. I was thus in-
duced to try your Aifaline Remedies, ana their effect W’as
magical. I have often since recommended them to my
neighbors, all of whom have felt the oenefit as well as
myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,
as several doctors had given me up, as my husband can
testify.—Yours truly, (Signed) Mrs. H. SMITH.

Sth. Murwillumbah, Jan. 4, '99.
Herr Rassmussen, Sydney.—Dear Sir,—Having just
finished the course of Aifaline Blood Pills and Aifaline

they have effected a complete and permanent cure, al-
though previous to trying them I had tried three different

gratitude, you are perfectly at liberty to publish this short

A Cold Prospect.
A very important point for the consideration of
Australian Tory politicians will arise whene'er
the Commonwealth Parliament is_ formed. Ihe
Tory politicians of the various Upper Houses
the Levis and Embungs and their kind—all resist
the reform of their local Upper Houses upon a
democratic basis on the ground that the ruck, the
common, objectionable ruck, shouldn’t be allowed
either to sit on these august institutions, or vote
at their elections, or have anything to do with
them whatever. Their theory is that an U pper
House is a high and noble institution, breathing a
pure and elevated political atmosphere : and the
mass of the people are coarse and ignorant, and
wear thick boots and ill-fitting clothes and are
foolish-and muddy and accursed. Yet when these
lofty souls want to get into the I ederal benate or
House of Representatives, as very many of them do,
they can only manage it by appealing to the class
j which they have always scorned and declared to be
unfit to be trusted with full political power. Loth
Federal Houses will be elected on the basis of One
Man One Vote, with no property qualification for
members. So Levi and Lbkne/.eu W mn. and
their species, if they want to rise to the dignity of
being Federal Senators, have simply to tell the
people this: “We have always said you were too
Ignorant and gross and hobnailed to be fit to elect
an Upper House. Therefore please give your
votes to the men who have habitually aimed mud
and derision at you. We still say that you are
unfit to sit in, or have a voice in choosing, the
State Legislative Councils, and we will do our
best to keep you there. Kindly express jour
sense of the truth of this insulting estimate of j ou
by supporting us.” And the people will presum-
ablv answer with a loud voice and a loud bad egg
“ N<>.” The existing lory M s.L.G. who want to
qualify for billets in the purely democratic * ederal
Legislature will have to do something, and do it
in a considerable hurry, to prove that they are the
sort of people any sane Democracy would want to
elect as its representatives. If they consent to a
reform of the existing Leg. Councils on the lines
of the Federal Upper House the people maj
thereby gather that they are men who can be
trusted to look after a democratic 1 ederal Consti-
tution, but otherwise they will almost certainly
have to remain behind in obscurity. And . tate
Legislatures will be very obscure places, where
the rain of titles will fall as thinly as the ram in
an old-man drought, and their members will be
very moderately “lion, within the province, and
have a hard back seat at public functions, and the
lofty Federal member will only see them with
difficulty when he meets them, and will have to
think awhile before lie remembers whether thej
are M’s.L.C. or only town-clerks.
Out of 20 dairy-hands in a place only J.i
miles from Melbourne, only four knew the name

one knew the real meaning of “ Door hut H "ere

Messrs. H. Potior and Co., 24 Royal

commemoration of the departure of the Bushmen s
Contingent. The obverse bears the head of the
Queen and the inscription “ ISWI British Fraiis-
vaal War” ; the obverse the Hgure of a bush-
ranger ’’suddenly alarmed, reining m Ins battle-
steed, and shading his glittering'eye with his ham

The famous name of Mick Simmons is
now branded on several of tbe handsomest shops
in Sydney; and the name has Ijecome svnonynious
with up-to-dateness and attraction. -The display
of pipes and tobacco is something for a sightseer
to dwell upon with pleased and astonished eyes;
while the variety of flavors and excellence of
brands is bound to please smokers and 11011-smokers
the world over. Mick Simmons is coming well
to the fore, too, with jewellery, table cutlery,
walking sticks, purses, wallets, card cases, dressing
cases, and a hundred other fancy goods of hand-
some style and finish ; and costing so small a
price that no one minds parting up for the bargain.
As a supplier of sporting goods Mick Simmons
stands first for quality, variety and completeness
The tennis goods are a grand lot; the cricket
goods are as good as W G. Grace ever saw ;
while the boxing gloves, dumb bells and Indian
clubs commend themselves to those gentlemen
who are anxious to make their niaik in life.
Some time ago Professor Schenk burst into
the ring of the great ones of the earth with a
theorv for the arbitrary determination of human
sex. He published lus book and boomed loudly,
and' was employed by kings, councillors, jockeys,
and the rest of the salt of the earth. When the
boom was at the loudest, the Czar of all the
Russias employed him to ensure an heir to the
uneasy throne of the Romanoffs. It was said that
the Czarina did not wish to have a son ; the idea
of bringing a son into the world to be tormented
by Nihilists'terrified ber. She is alleged to have
deliberately reversed Schenk’s treatment ; any-
h >w, the heir turned up a daughter. 1 lien Schenk
slumped badly. Now lie has gone bung altogether
He has been chief of the Embryological Institute
of Vienna University for 28 years and when Ins
boom subsided to a mere cracked noise, the
faculty reached for bis hair. I bey investigated
his alleged discovery, and then subjected the boy-
maker to a “disciplinary examination, and re-
commended that he be sacked and pensioned for
advancing a frivolous idea as a scientific theory.
The Minister of Instruction could not find it in
his heart to deal roughly with one who had pre-
scribed for the Russian Empress, and lie begged
Schenk to complain of old age and apply for a
pension. Schenk accordingly grew old su.ldoiilj,
aud applied to be pensioned off. Winch he
promptly was.

empire and the power thereof. But of all the attiilmtes
of empire, mere greatness is the least admirable ; and of
all the P attributes of power, truculence the meanest. Irue

Impossibly the moral of the foregoing.
Bill Copley (“Turncoat Bill”), of S.A. j
Parliament, has got the loyal disease so badly that
he and Labor-member Guthrie lately swarmed
into the Government House premises and hauled
down the S.A. flag. Bill claims that only the
British ensign should hang there, and that the
presence of the S.A. flag is a sign of disloyalty
and of a desire to disrupt the Empire. The
beastly Australian emblem has been waving from
the banner at Government House for about two
years without any serious complaint, but the war
filled Bill Copley with a desire to assist the
Empire in some way that would get in the papers
and cost nothing. And it struck him that insult-
ing the flag of the province which pays his salary
was as good an idea as any.

The Queen publishes an interesting article
alleging that the sudden appearance of an army of
foreign youths has just about sol veil the servant-
gal problem in the Motherland. They are general 1 y
spoken of as “German waiters” but are said
to really consist of Germans, Poles, Swiss,
Italians, and Hungarians. They work for low
wages, almost no wages, and many of them are
said to be in receipt of constant drafts from their
own country. Their ostensible reason is that they
wish to learn the English language. _ Why they
should resort to humping coal upstairs, blacking
Ik tots, and beating carpets for less wages than the
ordinary servant girl in order to learn the language
strikes even the old cattism of the Queen as
peculiar. The admiring pen-woman remarks : “ l
have seen foreign domestics who looked like gentle-
men in disguise,” In 18114 the French found the
cheap domestic and low-priced clerk problem
suddenly settled the same way. When the
German armies rolled through France in 70 they
knew exactly the resources of every village
and city they came to, and were always in possession
of the most perfect local knowledge, and were
never led into any traps. They seemed to know
the country better than the French themselves.
Bv-and bye many French merchants and gentry
recognised their old domestics and scribblers in
positions of authority in the invading ranks, and it
struck the French national intellect that thecheap,
educated, foreign clerks and low-priced male
housemaids were military spies who had carefully
mapped out the country and its resources to give
polish to Moltke’s strategy.

For more Than One Hundred fears
SOAP
has maintained its supremacy in the face of the whole
world’s competition. Such a record could' not be
achieved without cause. Temporary successes are com-
paratively easy, but for an article to maintain its popu-
larity generation after generation it must appeal to
something more than passing fancy. This is the case
with Pears’ Soap. It is, and always has been, an honest
product. Everywhere abroad it has found a place in
public favour equal to that for so long held in England.
Men and women alike find it good and reliable. The
man who has once tried Pears’ Soap in the form of a
Shaving Stick wants no other, he takes it wdth him on all
his journeys. The woman who travels and fails to take
a supply of Pears’ must put up with substitutes until
her burning, smarting skin inexorably demands the
“ matchless for the complexion.”
Too Lonesome.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Star, referring to the case of a widow who received
a sum of money from a relief fund on account of the death
of her husband, says that she married again, was deserted,
and was thus “ left penniless and doubly alone.” Un-
happy female.
Her case was the strangest
In history known,
The poor widdy woman
Left “doubly alone.”
When light-hearted people
Were laughing at ease,
A-moaning she sat, with
Her hands on her knees.
Her money was squandered
And times they were bad
AlaC for the widdy—
Two hungers she had.
Two thirsts she had also,
A brewer would buy ;
But, ah ! for the widdy,
Her tongues remained dry.
The cold wind it filled her
Two empty insides;
She wrung her four hands, and
She rocked her four sides.
“Woe’s me !” she cried sadly,
With two-barrelled moan,
“ To be a poor widdy
Left doubly alone ! ”
For whether she stayed in
Her liu, or went out,
Two grim Lonesomenessea
Were always about.
One Lonesomeness dark on
Tne other one sat —
Like a large-size black hat on
A smaller black hat.
She died, and, I fancy,
Her last words they were
That two Lonesomenesses
Were too much for her.

A remarkable case of will-paralysis oc-
curred the other day at Gympie (Q.). A young
miner, fooling with gelignite, held a plug with
inch fuse in left hand and lit it. Changed it then
to his right, and found himself unable to drop it,
though perfectly aware what would happen if he
did not do so, and warned by the shouts of his
companions to let go and come away. Held on
like a hero till the explosion came and took off
four fingers and most of his palm. Can’t explain
anything except that he was nearly breaking his
immortal soul trying to drop it and it wouldn't

The Funerals of Malachi
Mooney.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A number of Bungaree farmers, called from the
fields, stood bare-headed about the sick-bed in
attitudes of grievous constraint. Mrs. Mooney,
seated on a low stool, wept sluice-heads, with
wailing and querulous protestations. She had
been replenishing the fountain of tears with
whisky, and now cherished a great grievance
against Malachi for dying, and the time chosen,
and the manner thereof.
“There’s hwhisky by the jar, min,” said the
dying man in a thin wheeze. “ Be dhrinkin’.”
Hogan gravely assumed authority over the
jar, and filled up for the company with judicial
impartiality.
“Good luck to ye, Mullocky,” said Hogan,
raising his cup.
Malachi waved his thin hand in expostulation.
He was beyond all chances of fortune in this
world, and knew it. Hogan temporised.
“Good luck to ye, Mullocky, pwhere ye’re
goin’.”
“ How dar ye doi, Mooney—how dar ye do id ? ”
wailed Mrs. Mooney, throwing her apron over
her head, and rocking her body to and fro.
The company drank with one action, quite
military in its precision, and then looked towards
Malachi Mooney for further orders, and Malachi
lay peacefully, happily dead with a smile on his
lips, and the half-drained mug in his wasted
fingers.
“Oh, ye divil! t’ be dyin’ on me like dthis,”
moaned Mrs. Mooney under her apron. “I’m
disaved in yeh, Mooney! disaved! disaved!
Whurra whroo ! ”
Presently, perceiving that Malachi was beyond
argument, she lifted up her voice and filled the
house with dolorous cries, and wailed dutifully
and monotonously far into the night, when the
chant was taken up by eerie, wrinkled old crones,
smoke-dried grandmothers lent for the occasion by
sympathetic families from the four quarters of the
wilderness.
What a wake that was! It lasted all night,
and right up to the time fixed for the funeral.
There was no end to the willing drinkers, and no
limit to the whisky. Indeed, the miraculous
manner in which tiny kegs, loaded to the bung,
rolled from under the bed on demand, confirmed
the local opinion that “ Mullocky ” Mooney had
more than a finger in the snug still, the smoke
from which curled so artfully up from a charred
trunk on Peter’s Hill, and was thoughtfully given
a supernatural origin by the neighborly people of
the district.
The funeral was advertised to move from the
home of deceased at 10 a.m. sharp. It was a long
march to the Ballarat old cemetery, and an early
start was deemed necessary in consideration of the
fact that Hooley’s funeral, which happened a
month earlier, had been fined for furious driving,
by reason of the anxiety of the mourners to reach
the graveyard before closing time.
The vehicles began to arrive at seven in the
morning, the farmers and settlers driving, and
their wives and “childer” loaded in behind. A
funeral was a “trate” that didn’t happen every
day, and it would have been considered a sin to
deprive the “byes” and “gurrls” of a bit of
“ enjymint ” that cost nothing. But many of the
mourners had been at Mooney’s all night, “ kapin’
the carpse company,” and daybreak disclosed a
baker’s dozen scattered about the farm, sleeping
where they fell. One hung over the dog-leg fence
“ fprninst ” the house, like an old shirt, with down-
swinging arms. Canty, recumbent against the
butt-end of a gum, rigid as a stump, slept so pro-
foundly that the old guttural Brahma-pootra had
perched on his bald and awful head, and was
defying creation with senseless repetitions of his
cracked clarion. Others reposed curled against
the house, and several dotted the paddock like
quaint hieroglyphics, objects of wonderment and
noisy speculation to the familiar pigs.
Michael Morrissey was the first to drive up.
Michael was to occupy an honourable and respon-
sible position at the head of the procession. He
had generously offered the use of his trap as
hearse, and it was appropriately draped for that
solemn office. This vehicle was an American
waggon, and it had been roofed over about two
feet from the floor, and was ordinarily used for
the conveyance of meat, Michael being a butcher.
There was a door at the back, and just room
within for Mooney’s coffin. Quinn’s trotter,
The Imp, was in the shafts. The Imp had
been borrowed for the occasion because he was
the only black horse in the district; but although
his complexion was satisfactory, his disposition
quite unsuited him for so grave a duty. He was old,
and had a semi-bald tail; but there was a peculiar
and aggressive jauntiness about the beast altogether
out of harmony with his years and the situation in
which he found himself. He held his head high,
and pricked his ears, and his tail had a perky ele-
vation that exhibited the bald butt to the worst
advantage, and excited popular derision wherever
he went.
When the friends of the late Malachi Mooney
arrived, they walked reverently into the room
where Malachi still lay on the bed amongst his
monumental candles, and gazed on him for a
moment with pensive sadness, as in duty bound.
“Poremahn, he have the peaceful shmile on
him.”
“ He have, he have.”
And after repeating the sentiment several times,
with nodding heads and much wise clicking of
tongues, having paid their respects to the dead,
they withdrew to the kitchen, and devoted them-
selves to the whisky.
The coffin had been delivered, and stood on two
bush stools in the kitchen, decently covered with
a black shawl. Mrs.. Mooney sat at the foot,
adjacent to a pannikin, and continued to upbraid
Mooney for his inconsiderate conduct in dying,
and “ lavin’ a lone lorn widdy.”
The funeral moved at 11, when it was quite cer-
tain that only one baby keg remained. This keg
Morrissey took with him on the improvised
hearse, as a wise provision for the first half of the
journey, which lay through a barren land.
Many of the mourners had to be helped into
their vehicles, and after the start many remained
in only by a miracle. Morrissey led the way, The
Imp stepping along with a frivolous kind of a
four-footed jig that robbed the cortege at the out-
set of any pretence to dignity. O’Connor’s old
waggonette followed, O’Connor driving carefully,
strapped down, and Mrs. O’Connor and the
“ widdy ” occupying the back seat. Then came
Clark in his spring-cart, driving The Imp’s rival,
Colleen. After him two or three miscellaneous
vehicles, and then a long string of wood drays,
each in charge of an unnaturally rigid and solemn
Irishman perched on a candle box, and each con-
taining one or two women and three or four children,
the former squatting composedly on the bottom of
the dray with their substantial feet swinging out
behind. A dozen sleepy, unshaven, unshorn agri-
culturists brought up the rear, riding two abreast
on large morbid horses that shuffled moodily
through the dust with drooped heads and sagging
under-lips.
The women in the drays maintained a shrill
conversation along the line, but for the most part
the men observed an owl-like decorum until the
Travellers’ Rest was reached, that is if the
puffing of abbreviated black clays be not con-
sidered derogatory to true reverence. Meanwhile,
the day being hot and the way dusty, a couple ol
short halts had served to drain the keg on the
hearse. It was a gritty, drought-stricken funeral
that descended upon the Travellers’ Rest, and
when it moved again it left the wayside inn as dry
as a powder-mill, having drunk up everything in
the bar, and demolished the water-butt.
And now a great spirit of unrest took possession
of many of the mourners, and there was much
whooping and many manifestations of a wild and
unholy desire to convert the procession into some-
thing like a steeplechase. The Imp was stepping
out gaily with his deceitful double-shuffle, game
as a pebble despite his age and infirmities, but it
was Clark with Colleen who led the breakaway.
Springing up with a whoop and whooroo, Clark
whipped his mare alongside the hearse.
“Morrissey,” he cried, “I can bate that
bumble-footed ould crock to the Pint beyant fer
tin bob! ”
“Ye can’t!” roared Morrissey, all the sports-
man stirring within him.
“Ye loi!” Clark fairly shrieked, laying the
whip on.
Michael lashed The Imp, and the veteran,
scenting a contest, snorted defiance, and hit out
with all four afflicted legs at once. Then, bound-
ing over ruts, jumping the boulders, rocking and
rearing, the two vehicles went thundering through
the dust, Colleen leading and The Imp following,
flinging wide his legs with the action of a startled
tarantula as he rushed down the hill, his body
working with the antic spasms of two pigs in a
bag.
The other drivers flogged their stolid horses
into unwonted activity, and in this way the mad
funeral, strung out a mile long, tore through one
affrighted township, scattering sows and suck-
lings, goats, dogs, poultry, and shrieking children,
raising a dust that blotted out half the landscape,
and filling men and women with a wonderment
that lasted many days. Half a mile beyond, The
Imp, with a triumphant tail and starting eye-
balls, flung past the Colleen with a rush and a
roar, neatly carrying away Clark’s near wheel,
which went humming ahead down the well-worn
track.
Morrissey obtained control over his blood horse
and succeeded in pulling up about a mile further
on, and there he waited for the rest of the funeral
in a humble and contrite frame of mind. The
procession arrived in sections, the heavy horses
spent and reeking, and the mourners coated
thickly with powdered clay that caked rapidly in
the sun on their perspiring faces. The women,
particularly the stout ones, tumbled and bumped

MISS MARY TRELOAR.
When a woman’s back aches from morning till
night, when she feels all worn out after every bit of
work, when it is torture for her to stoop or bend
her body, when she has headaches and dizzy spells,
it is a sure sign that her kidneys . are not acting
properly. ICXrie acid and other poisons that ought
to be taken out of the blood by the kidneys are
being left in, and are carrying disease into every
part of the body, ... .
It is not safe to trifle with kidney disease.. Ihe
backache may g© axway for a time, but it will not
stay away unless you get at the cause and heal the
kidneys. To show what backache leads to, and
how to cure it, we quote from the letter of a lady
•of South Australia, -which should be read and
heeded by every woman of Australia.
“ For some years :my back has troubled me . a
great deal. The paiin was a shifting sort of pain
that would be first iin ithe small of the back, and
then up between :the shoulders, and down in the
loins. These pains-were so bad that I could not
move about, stand up or sit down, without suffer-
ing an increase of pain. I could not get relief
even by lying down. Gradually I noticed certain
■other signs of kidney trouble. The secretions
from the kidneys became irregular, and unnatural.
As these last symptoms were dangerous they
alarmed me, and like so many others I also began
to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and I must
say with splendid results. . They have done me a
world of good. My back is better, and the kid-
ney secretions are now natural. You are at
liberty to use this as you see fit, and I give you
authority to publish it for others’ benefit.
“(Signed) Miss Mary Treloar, Knox-street,
Kapunda, South Australia.” (Miss Treloar’s pic-
ture is given above.)
When your kidneys are not doing their work, it
will be manifested by pain or dull ache in the
back, rheumatic pains, sciatica, sediment in the
urine, scanty supply, scalding irritation in passing
it, obliged to go often during the day and to get
up during the night, uric acid, sleeplessness,
nervousness, irritability, sallow, unhealthy com-
plexion, puffy or dark circles under the eyes, loss
of energy and ambition. If your water when
allowed to remain undisturbed for twenty-four
hours, forms a sediment or settling, or has a cloudy
appearance, it is evidence that your kidneys and
bladder need immediate attention.
If you have any of the above symptoms, Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills will set you right, and
cure you. We will gladly send you the names of
thousands who have testified to what Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills have done for them.
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS

Eczema.
Ever have any irritation of the skin ? There are
many forms of it, any of them bad enough to tax
your patience. Hemorrhoid, a plague of the
night; no rest for the sufferer from this complaint.
Eczema, too; hives don’t sound dangerous, but
they cause much misery to those unfortunate
enough to be troubled with them. Doan’s Oint-
ment is “a wonder” for any such trouble. No
troublesome irritation of the skin can resist its
healing, soothing influence. We know it, and
lots of Sydney people know it now.
A nurse, residing at 428 Jones-street, Ultimo,
states : “I have been a sufferer from itchiness of
the skin for some time. I did not know the cause
of it, but it irritated me very much indeed. I
have cured many skin complaints for other people,
but I could not get anything that was good for my
■own ailment until I used Doan’s Ointment, which
J procured one day when visiting Newman’s Phar-
macy in King-street. I think I must have used
'most everything for such troubles, but Doan’s
-Ointment is best of all. It cured the itchiness
which I suffered from entirely and almost imme-
diately.”
The lady gave us these facts twelve months ago,
: and now she speaks further upon the subject: “A
year ago I gave you a testimonial regarding the
medicinal properties of Doan’s Ointment. I have
used this Ointment for various purposes since, and
noticed its splendid curative powers, and must
acknowledge that it is the finest remedy for skin
diseases I have ever come across. It seems to cure
permanently in every case, and its quick effects
are simply marvellous.”
Doan’s Ointment is splendid in all Diseases of
the Skin, Eczema, Piles, Hives, Insect Bites,
Sores, Chilblains, &c. It is perfectly safe and
very effective.
Doan’s Ointment has been tested in so many
ways, in hospital work, in private practice, and
has proved so successful that a special arrange-
ment has been made by which all readers of The
Bulletin who have not already tried it may
obtain a sample pot free by mail by sending us
their names and addresses and a penny stamp to
pay postage. We know that this ointment will
cure these affections, that it will cure them abso-
lutely, and we want you to know it. It is per-
fectly unnecessary for anyone to suffer from Piles
or Eczema for one moment. Doan’s Ointment will
cure them absolutely, but do not take our word for
it; send a penny stamp for a sample box. The
large size box is sold at 2s. 9d. per box (six boxes
15s. 3d.). If you cannot obtain it locally from
your chemist or storekeeper, same will be posted
on receipt of price by the proprietors, Foster-

Bulletin.
out of all knowledge and restraint, were loud and
fierce in their complainings, and the men agreed
that it was “ ondacent ” and “ agin religion ” to
conduct a funeral at a hard gallop. So Michael
led away again, holding his trotter hard, and pro-
ceeded as reverently and demurely as was possible
with such a horse and so much whisky.
Matty Clark was reported unharmed, and busy
fixing a skid in place of the lost wheel. It was
expected that he would turn back, and be no more
a disturbing element in his neighbor’s funeral.
The procession travelled into the outskirts of
Ballarat without any further misadventure. In
fact, most of the drivers and several of the ladies
were asleep, and the weary plough-horses drowsed
along at their own gait. The Imp, in spite of the
apparent sprightliness of his action, was a very
slow walker, for the reason that he generally
dropped his hoofs in almost the spots from which
he had just lifted them, and sometimes behind.
But at this point, cries of warning and of won-
dernment and disgust ran along the line, and look-
ing back, Morrissey beheld Matty Clark in the
distance, erect in his cart, gesticulating like a
maniac, and rapidly over-hauling the funeral.
Matthew had fixed a sapling under his trap for a
skid, and on this and one wheel he presently
rattled up alongside the hearse again, oblivious to
the threats and expostulations of the mourners.
“ Mike Morrissey, ye divil ye!” yelled Mat,
red, panting, and furious, “to the cemmethry fer
a quid ! ”
“ Niver a won av me,” replied Morrissey, hang-
ing on to The Imp.
“ Yis, be the powers !” roared Clark, shooting
ahead, and slashing viciously at the hearse-horse
as he passed.
Michael clung to the reins, and hauled with all
his might, but The Imp was not to be denied.
Squealing shrilly in reply to the challenge, he
broke into his old, ungainly, link-motion combina-
tion of canter, amble and trot, and spread himself
all over the road in pursuit of Colleen.
A couple of horsemen put their nags to a gallop
to head-off Matty Clark, and in this way the
funeral broke in upon Ballarat, careering down
Humphrey-street, and stirred the city to its
depths.
Fortunately Colleen was headed just before
reaching the main thoroughfare, and Daly and
O’Mara seized upon Matty, who was a small,
bristly Hibernian, and fought like a peccary. They
they got him down and tied him up. Then, after
throwing their turbulent captive into the cart,
O’Hara sat on his chest and led the horses, and
Daly, driving Colleen, now blown and humbled,
took up a subordinate position at the tail of the
procession ; while the funeral, which had paused to
collect itself once more, moved on, followed by a
delighted crowd of children and many envious
adults.
Many astonishing funerals had come up out of
Bungaree into Ballarat East, but Malachi
Mooney’s funeral was the most weird and wonder-
ful that ever invaded any town on the Australian
continent, and news of it seemed to have electric
passage through the place. The improvised hearse
with the well-intentioned effort to rig a pair of
plumes of cock’s feathers upon it, the strange,
jocund horse that hauled it, and the great, red,
clayed-up, hairy, wild-eyed Galway man driving,
were alone sufficient to have brought the whole
population into Bridge-street ; but with the added
attractions—the awful procession of drays, their
dusty, kiln-dried occupants, and the last vehicle
riding jauntily on its. skid, the funeral simply
stopped business, and took possession of the town,
and drew the people after it in crowds.
Morrissey had the reins wound about his wrists,
and with his heels dug in and his eyes obtruding
and all his faculties intensely concentrated hung to
The Imp. The matrons still swung their stout
feet, and here and there a worn-out mourner
slept in his dray, Heffernan and Moore with their
headssuspendedover the tail andtheirmouthsopen.
The police followed too ; .and eyed the procession
dubiously, half-inclined to arrest the whole f uneral;
but by exercising the severest self-restraint and
the greatest cautioij the mourners contrived to
pull through, and arrived at the cemetery with
the coffin in good order and condition at half-past
four.
After the usual preliminaries the coffin was
carried to the graveside by four of the late
Mooney’s most intimate friends, and, considering
all things, their progress down the path was not
as devious as might have been expected, but they
landed the pine casket with a dump that produced
the greatest sensation of the day. The coffin lid
had not been screwed down, and it slipped to one
side, making a revelation. There were many
cries and much commotion when it was seen that
the coffin contained packages of sugar and tea
and miscellaneous groceries, and nothing more.
Malachi Mooney was not there ! Consternation
sat whitely upon every face, and the women
crossed themselves vigorously.
“He’s bin slipirited away !” wailed the “ widdy.”
“ Did annywon see us dthrop him ? ” asked the
dazed Morrissey in a small, awed voice.
Flynn remembered now having packed the
groceries in the coffin the day before. He it was
who carted the casket out from Ballarat, and
having goods to carry at the same time, packed
them into the “ piner ” for “ convanience,” and by
reason of the thirst that' came upon him and
possessed him for two days “ disremembered
lvirything aftherwards.”
In truth the late Malachi Mooney still lay
undisturbed upon the bed in his humble home in
Bungaree, and the last of the yard-long candles
guttered in the brass-sockets at his head. The
cor/fSe had been forr/otten !
And this is how Malachi Mooney came to have
two funerals.

lonely, Mother dreaming of old times when her
boys were babies. George’s ’possum, crawls
dejectedly on to her knee. Billy’s magpie struts

snore heavily. It begins to get dusk).
The Father : Time to see about the horses.
The Mother : Time to see about the supper.

Mother finds her way to Willie’s room—Willie,

It’s about you, too. Ought to be cheerin’ readin’.

to-day is Mrs. Cameron from Boolibooloo. Her
six sons have all gone to the war, and she may
well take first place among all the proud mothers
of the day.” What do you think of that now ?
The proudest woman in Australia, her mind

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Her eyes reflect her own blue skies,
With far-off dreamy reaches ;
Her cheeks have caught the russet dyes
Of pomegranates and peaches.
Her breath hath savour of the scents
That her own bush doth lavish,
Her smile hath magic that dements,
Her lips have sweets that ravish.
Her golden hair the sunbeams curl,
And play about its tresses ;
Oh ! Nancy is a winsome girl
Bred of the sun’s caresses.
Her draperies have cunning art—
In blue she is a darling,
In white she plunders every heart,
In anything she’s charming.
She is not vain, nor too precise,
Her blush betrays but pleasure,
She loves whate’er she deemeth nice,
And takes it in full measure.
She is not coy nor very bold,
She hath her fine-wrought armour,
She will not every grace unfold
To any smooth-faced charmer.
She must be wooed by gentle arts,
And won by fond caresses;
For manly men and honest hearts
A weakness she confesses..
Nor will she be convention’s slave,
My free, my winsome Nancy ;
She roams at large like any knave,
And culls the flowers of Fancy.
She is a daughter of the Snn,
Her heart hath caught its brightness- p
The race for her hath but begun,
She treads on airy lightness..
While from the old she gleans the new,.
She is not deep, nor shallow ;
God keep her modest, brave, and true,.
With love our lives to hallow.

_ **My son, whose picture I send you, was taken very sick, became languid,
losing his appetite and seeming to lose all energy. Apparently he did not have
hardly any life left in him. He was so weak he would become unconscious
at times. He also had large swellings in his neck. I was greatly worried
over him. I took him to the doctors with no satisfactory results.
“I then resorted to Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, remembering that my sister derived
a wonderful amount of good from this same medicine.
“After a few days my boy’s health began to improve, his appetite returned,
and he gradually lost his extreme languidness. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla acted as a
grand tonic upon his whole system, and he soon began to scamper about like
other boys. I attribute his wonderful , recovery solely to the fact that he took
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and took it in time.”
This is the experience of Mrs. Arabella Graham (whose son’s portrait is given
above), of 73 Station St., Petersham, New South Wales. It is also the happy
experience of thousands of mothers all over the land. And it is the reason
■why Ayer’s Sarsaparilla has been named
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
It brings color to white lips and plumpness to pale cheeks.

PASTEURISED
BUTTER • • •
The same remarks that apply to milk apply equally to butter. Pasteurised butter is made from the very finest
cream, consequently the butter has a fine aroma that only Pasteurisation can give. There are a few, we are
to say, only a few, idiotic folks who will not be convinced of the value of the process ; but it is satisfactory
to know that these are getting less daily. The difference in price between Pasteurised, beautifully-flavored butter and the
ordinary make is only 4d. per lb, It would pay consumers well six times this difference. Heads of households should insist
that their grocer supplies Pasteurised butter, and if he will not, send your orders to US, and we will deliver it at your doors.
Good butter such as we have described is appreciated always, whereas at afternoon teas or for ordinary use
at any price. The famous “ Berry ” brand Pasteurised butter can be obtained only from this Company.
