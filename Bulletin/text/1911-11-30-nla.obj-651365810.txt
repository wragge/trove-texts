"Wawa-koo”
Gaze reverentially upon this word. It
is sacred, the most remarkable word in all
the ages of history and back beyond history.
It is (as near as we can get) the first poem
in the world.
So, at least, the erudition of A. S. Mac-
kenzie, Professor of English and Compara-
tive Literature at the Kentucky University,
has led him to believe. His book, The Evo-
lution of Literature (Murray, per Lockley
Library), is the first text-book of a new de-
partment of science which he has termed
• literatology. He is attempting to study
literature solely as a social phenomenon, as
one of the subdivisions of anthropology, the
science of man. The scope of this new
science of literary art may be easily defined
by a list of some of the definite problems that
by this method of study may be solved. A
few suggested by the author are:—
“If language is the medium of literature,
how did language arise? Why do children
rejoice, in a nursery rime and show less in-
terest in a prose version of the same narra-
tive? Is there any connection between child
games and the ballad or. the drama? How
did it ever occur to man to institute what
we call poetry? What is it that makes the
appeal of poetry so. unique, so universal?
Was music earlier than poetry? Why does
communal dancing decay in civilised society ?
What was its connection with poetry and
the drama? What was the earliest form of
poetryV Did prose arise before poetry?
What are the laws of prose rhythm? Why
are there certain favorite numbers in the
ballads and other forms of literature? In
what ways has journalism influenced litera-
ture? What is the essential difference be-
tween Oriental and Western literature, or
between ancient and modern? Is modern
drama decadent? Why is the novel so popu-
lar at present? As science increases must
art decrease?’'
Professor Mackenzie has not answered all
these questions, but he has suggested the
metbod of study that may lead to the an-
swers ; and he argues that the scientific
viewpoint of literature, with its intelligible
survey of the past, may tend to suggest and
develop forms of literary art which have not
hitherto occurred to man.
J*
Since we have no specimens of prehistoric
literary art, and no likelihood of unearthing
any, w T e must turn for assistance to ethno-
graphy. Prehistoric man has vanished, but
here and there still exist sheltered tribes
that are practically in the stage of develop-
ment characteristic of our prehistoric ances-
tors. It is to these tribes that we must go
in our hunt for the first poem. The litera-
ture of these hunting tribes has the best
chance of enshrining it. Probably the most
backward of living races are the Kwai or
Bushmen of the desert of Kalihari, in S.
Africa. They are merely a remnant of the
real aboriginal stock of S. Africa. And
among this tribe we discover the first poem.
Let Professor Mackenzie describe it:—
“It is a one-word poem, traditional and
inarticulate. Surely here w*e are not far
from the genesis of unwritten poetry or
folk-song. The dancer sings the word:
Wawa-koo.
“At the same time and in the same measure
the communal chorus sing:
Aye-o.
“Each of these embryonic poems is sung
again and again for hours.”
So here we have, approximately, the first
poem ever written. At Bulletin rates its
price would be one half-penny; but no tribe,
not even if composed of Bulletin poets,
would have the slightest chance of singing it
to the editor for hours. Modern poems are
not paid by the hour.
But this poem, so ancient that the mean-
ing of the words is lost, while having many
claims to being the oldest extant, has com-
petitors. One of these is sung by the same
also for hours, but it betrays evidences
of plagiarism in the chorus. The prehistoric
Roderic Quinn sings the words, “Lok a tay”
for hours, and the chorus keeps on replying
“Aye-o.”
These are one-word poems, but not there-
fore to be despised. There is a traditional
two-word poem, sung by the Botocudos of
Brazil, probably dating back to prehistoric
times. It runs thus :
Calani-a-a ,
Calani-a-ha.
“It is surely natural of us to expect
poetry to begin with one word rather than
with one hundred.-/Grant that the word is
merely exclamatory, does it not express feel-
ing? Grant that it is a verbal expression of
feeling, and we are shut up to the con-
clusion that in this oral symbol of feeling
lies the potentiality of lyric art. When the
‘Aye-o’ of a Kwai chorus or the ‘Amna aya’
of a Greenland community is set free, back
of it i$ the human consciousness which de-
fies analysis. Such a word or phrase is a
nucleus which in the course of time gathers
to itself companions, and becomes the loft-
iest expression of the human spirit.”
But the author suggests that, after all,
there were probably earlier poems, poems
that were not of one word, but of none. “In
one sense,” he says, “poetry is earlier than
articulate speech. At one time men may
have been speechless, but we cannot con-
ceive of a time when they were unable to
communicate with each other by gestures
and cries, by bodily and vocal movements.
Perhaps the earliest sounds were neither ar-
ticulate nor rational.” Thus the “O !” and
“Ah!” of British ballads, and the “Hooch!”
with which the Scot punctuates his reel- are
examples of the earliest prize poems of an-
tiquity. When a Scot, swung back by the
skirl of the bag-pipes and the motion of the
dance to his forgotten barbarism, feels called
upon to remark “Hooch!” at frequent inter-
vals, he is but repeating some great poem
that once stirred his prehistoric ancestors to
wild orgies of emotion. He has forgotten
what “Hooch !” means, but once it must have
meant something, and something vital. Per-
haps it is just as well. But “Hooch!” goes
up, with “Wawa-koo,” into the class of the
prize-poems of the prehistoric. Another vic-
tory for Scotland!
“Artistically there is a world of differ-
ence between the one-word verse of African
hunters and the poetry of a cultivated man
like Poe. Genetically, however, there is a
resemblance which may be clearly seen in
‘The Raven.’ The ‘Nevermore’ of this fami-
liar poem represents both the form and the
chief theme, for each stanza is but an
elaboration or variation of the key-word.”
Having settled the first poem, let us seek
the first epic. It comes from the same tribe
of Kwai. Translated, it informs us that:
Raselepe hounded like a lcid;
He hounded like the kid of an antelope.
This is the primitive heroic poem, a sort of
incipient epic. Another example, from an-
other tribe, has perhaps a better claim:
The headman —he fears no one.
This, of course, is sung for hours. These
are the only epics discovered among the
primitive tribes; and there’s a reason.
“The study of language seems to indicate
that a sense of group personality was the
earliest phrase of human consciousness. The
primordial personal conception is not singu-
lar but plural. . . .This linguistic theory
points back to a time when man was accus-
tomed to think, not from the individual but
from the collective standpoint. .. .At the
outset of his career man thought in terms of
his group rather than as a distinct indivi-
dual.”
The reason why the heroic lay is so rare
among primitive peoples is not because
heroes were scarce, but because the person-
ality .of the clan means more than the per-
sonality of any individual. There were no
individuals in prehistoric times.
Now, for the first short story, also' con-
tributed by the yellow-skinned Kwai of S.
Africa. It takes the form of a prayer to a
god :
Kaang! is it that thou dost not care for me?
Kaang! lead me to a male gnu.
I like much to have my stomach filled;
My eldest son, my eldest daughter, like to
have their stomachs filled.
Kaang! bring me a male gnu under my
arrows.
Even in those days it seems there was a
“Bellerive.”
S
But, before poetry, there was the dance —
the oldest of all the arts, as it is the earliest
in the history of each human being. The
whole social life of primitive man centres
round the dance; and the dance introduces
us to rhythm. Why is it that rhythm stirs
us?
“In listening to rhythmic sounds we are
not apart from but part of the rhythm. The
source and pleasure of rhythm lie deeper
than speech or culture; it satisfies a sub-
conscious need.”
Under strong emotion if is scarcely possible
to keep still. There is, indeed, a subtle con-
nection between motion and emotion. Para-
doxically the feeling of pleasure or triumph
is a sort of disguised pain; and our emotion
seeks an outlet in muscular movement.
. “There is a vital and necessary connec-
tion between emotional states and motor
sensations. We never experience any in-
tense emotion without becoming conscious of
bodily change. Thus the dance is a second-
ary manifestation of that desire of all
living things to increase pleasure and to
relieve pain. This is the fundamental motive
of all human activity... .Dancing arose not
because man desired to perfect himself in
hunting, fighting or magic, but simply be-
cause it was a means of enhancing pleasure
or forgetting pain.... Man could leap or
dance before he could sing, and he could
punctuate the dance with ejaculations be-
fore he felt confident enough to coin words
wherewith to tell a story in the form of
verse or prose.”
So from the quickening sense of rhythm came
the slogan, which is the germ of the war-
lyric and the patriotic hymn. The author
states that, among the hunting tribes, no
war-songs are more spirited than those of
Australia. Drama, in the simplest sense,
implies no more than significant bodily move-
ment. So we come to the answer of the
question whether poetry is older than prose.
“No matter how crude it may appear, oral
narration must have evolved later than
dance-song, whose simplest form is nothing
more than a rhythmic utterance of emotion.”
Lyric verse came before the simplest possible
prose.
These early lyrics are chiefly concerned
with the cow. The Dinkas, of the Eastern
Sudan, for instance, sing verses to the bull:
The white hull, shining like the sun, is a joy
to the women.
llis horns are like the masts of ships.
The ruler of the world delights in him.
His hump is so high that it towers above the
high grass.
And that bull is my aunt’s '"id she is giving
him to me.
The Fijian, however, is more interested in
the mosquito:—
Hark to the lament of the mosquito:
“Well it is that they should die and pass
onward,
“But, alas! for my conch shell [the human
ear] that they have taken away.”
Hark to the lament of the fly:
“Well it is that they should die and pass
onward,
“But, alas! they have taken away the eye
from which I drank.”
Why is the refrain in verse so popular?
Simply because it is originally the inarticu-
late dance-chorus, and, therefore, lies deeply
imbedded, in our ancestral subconsciousness.
So. rime is but a manifestation of that repe-
tition that pleased the Kwai so much that
he sang his “Wawa-koo” for hours.
“The ceaseless chanting of a single verse
inevitably produces the simplest" possible
rime, and it is this crude monorime which is
heard in the Central Australian fire-chant,
the Queensland lament and the Y r edda arrow T-
cliant. In primitive rime the tonal endings
are identical. . . .There is no valid reason for
supposing that one race of people invented
rime, and that all the others borrowed the
invention.”
“It is not difficult to believe that metre
had its origin in the cadence of the dance,
short measures being at first universal be-
cause they were best adapted to the simple
expression of simple feeling. They were as
natural as breathing.”
Such are some of the conclusions reached
by Prof. Mackenzie —enough to prove that
the new science of Li teratology needs its
patient investigators. And the world of
literatpre can never be grateful enough to
this Kentucky professor for having dredged
from the depths of time the first lyric—that
euphonious inspiration, so uplifting, so
poetic, so chaste, that distilled essence of all
the epics, all the ballads, all the sonnets in
the world—“Wawa-koo.”
D. Fraser Lumsden, who, under the pen-
name of “Lionel Laggard,” wrote a good
Australian story in Sweet Isabel of Narra-
goon, is now responsible for Love and Life
(Digby, Long). His hero is a parson with
a past, a habit of preaching, soliloquising
at length, writing verse and keeping a dull
diary. However, occasionally he gets
drunk. The story opens in Wales and ends
in Australia. It has a good conventional
plot, but is written without style, and with
no sense for deleting the unessential. A
passage like this, for instance: —
“ ‘But come, dear, let us go for a stroll.’
“Nancy quietly put on her hat and ac-
companied Mr. Tom. They went shopping.
“The Rev. William Gale and Nancy visi-
ted Mr. Cochrane, who was the proprietor of
a jam factory, and spent a very eqjoyable
evening at his house.”
There is very little subtlety in the char-
acterisation, and even a person of the name
of Jupiter Judkins fails to live up to his
name. But it is interesting, not solely from
the fact that half the book deals with Austra-
lian life.
The Peter Pan Picture-booh (Bell) is
now available for 3s. 6d. net —which means
more in this benighted continent—-with all
the charming color illustrations. Just the
book for the Christmas kiddie.
A Touch of Fantasy
To a person with a matter-of-fact mind
the triumphs of Science mean only a more
intimate knowledge of a Dirty Drab world.
Such a one has never known the glow and
exaltation which come to him who sees Life
as Dose Pink through the illusions of Youth.
Wisdom has no rewards which can compen-
sate the latter for the loss of that
brief Vision, for it is better to have
lived for a time in a Pool’s Paradise
than never to have had a glimpse of any
paradise at all. .. Imagine, then, an aver-
age tepid, myopic young njan, suddenly pro-
vided with a pair of spectacles, through
which he sees the romance latent in reality,
and something of the beauty and the wonder
of the of which he had previously
been unaware. There you have the be-
ginning of an interesting situation, which
Arthur H. Adams has developed in A Touch
of fantasy (Lane, per Sydney Book Club).
Almost the first thing these magic glasses
do is to light a raging fire of love in the
hero’s breast. It happened at Mosnian Bay,
where an accident threw the lady into his
arms. She is a tea-room girl, and, accord-
ing to her friends, “hot stuff.” To the hero
she is, of course, the Madonna, Mona Lisa
and Helen of Troy in one —and, after all,
she marries him.
It is a capital fantasy, worked out in
terms of reality, with a lightness of touch
which is admirable. The weakness of the
story is in the realities. The boarding-
house in which the hero lived as a bachelor
might prove the truth of Stephen Leacock’s
axiom, that all boarding-houses are the same
boarding-house ; but the old “hens” in it are
unsatisfactory. The magic glasses should
not have so quickly affected Robjohn’s ideas
about Economics—a subjective matter. They
are convincing, while they enable him to see
beneath the surface of others, so that;
It seemed as if mankind, shut up on
its lonely spinning globe, had always, deep
down, beyond its surface differences, a basic
fund of human kindliness, a broad comrade-
ship for its own kin. Life had taken the
masking individualties that we wear, and
torn them from our faces, letting us see be-
neath our disguises the grave smile of ten-
derness on our brothers’ lips.
The story of Robjohn’s married life is
full of interest for all who are or ought to be
married, and the end is a fine touch —not of
fantasy, but of human nature.
B.S.
Arnold Bennett
With lo novels, seven fantasies, two
volumes of short stories, three dramas and
eight volumes of belles-lettres to his credit
Arnold Bennett has won for himself a sure
place among the first five living writers
in England. The other four? Hardy, Wells,
Galsworthy, and Bernard Shaw. But make
your own selection. His art is that of a
slow, deliberate, patient realism; he de-
pends little on the cunning of a well-con-
trived plot; his method is to build up a
character and evolve an atmosphere with
almost niggling little touches, till his con-
ception stands out, rounded and solid with
no indication or mark of the craftsman’s
tools. He really belongs to an earlier genera-
tion. He deals for preference in the mid-
period of the last century; he has not the
passionate modernity, the swift look into the
future that marks Wells and Galsworthy
And his best work is local, confined within
the dull precincts of “the five towns.”
In Clayhanger he told, with his peculiar
delight in the delineation of the sordid side
of old age and his unique insight into the
chaotic mind of youth, the development of a
diffident youth, ending the book at the
moment when he wins the love of Hilda
Lessways. And now Hilda Lessways (Me-
thuen, per Dymock’s Library), the pro-
mised complement of Clayhanger, makes
its appearance. And “the later history of
Hilda Lessways and Edwin Clayhanger will
form the theme of another novel.”
In Hilda Lessways Bennett tells an
already told tale from the woman’s point of
view. It would be thought that such an
attempt must be dull. A proof of Bennett’s
art is that it is not. Hilda’s story is even
more interesting than Edwin’s. In the man’s
story Hilda always appears to him as a
heroine, for it is the man looking on the
woman he loves, while he, of course, appears
with all his faults thick upon him. And in
Hilda Lessways we see the woman idealis-
ing this youth, whom we have learnt is
made of the common stuff of humanity,
while Hilda exposes herself to us in all her
crudity, her foolish susceptibility and her
weakness. And yet we see quite plainly
why it was that two men fell so in love with
her.
Hilda Lessways is noticeable for Bennett’s
analysis of the strange ferment that puberty
sets going in the mind of a young girl.
Always She felt intensely “the romantic
quality of existence,” even in the most com-
monplace moments. To her, in her exalta-
tion at walking with the first man she had
been thrown into contact with, the sight of
a passing policeman was “beautiful.” And at
another matter-ofrfact interview with the
man, simply because “he looked firmly at
her, with a peculiar expression”:—
Suddenly she felt all her slimness and
fragility; she felt all the girl in herself and
all the dominant man in him, and all the
empty space around them. She went hot.
Her sight became dim. She was ecstati-
cally blissful; she was deeply ashamed.
She desired the experience to last for ever,
and him and herself to be eternally move-
less ; and at the same time she desired to
fly. Or-, rather, she had no desire to fly,
but her voice and limbs acted of themselves,
against her volition. . . And she was
ashamed of her shame, and furious against
the childishness that made her frown, and
lower her eyes, and escape out of the room
like a mouse.
Of course, the book is full of insight into
humanity. Here, to conclude, is a general
observation that seems as if it might be
true : .;.
All six women had the feeling, which
comes to most women at a certain moment
in each day, that life had, for a time, de-
teriorated into the purposeless and the
futile; and that it waited, as in a trance,
until some external masculine event, ex-
pected or unforeseen, should renew its virtue
and its energy.

SANACINE prevents the wasting and tearing of the Tissues that occurs in violent colds, clears
away the congested phlegm, and speedily allays irritation and inflammation of the respiratory
organs, and strengthens the linings of the throat and nose. Coughs, Colds, Influenza,
Lung Weakness, Head and Chest Colds, Throat Weakness and more virulent forms of colds
immediately yield to the vigorous curative action of Sanacine. A few doses taken in the early
stages diminish the severity of an attack, and a rapid cure is assured.

Nervous Breakdown
CURED IN THIS CASE BY
CLEMENTS TONIC
Nervous Breakdown or Nerve Debility often baffles the best medical skill, and
is often pronounced incurable. Here is a case cured by Clements Tonic. Read it.
No. 6 Post Office Place,
South Melbourne, 2/7/’x'i.
CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“ Your tonic is one of the quickest Nerve and Brain cures that
ever was known. I tried all kinds of doctor’s medicines, and got no
relief, but I have from your tonic. I was that weak at times a child
could push me over. I couldn’t sleep ; I used to listen to the clock
striking hour after hour ; now I can sleep at once. I think my case is
one of the worst I ever heard of. To tell you the real truth, I CAN
HARDLY MYSELF BELIEVE THE RELIEF I HAVE GOT
FROM THOSE TWO BOTTLES YOU SENT ME. Before I
got your tonic I was going twice a week to the Melbourne Hospital,
and there were a lot of people there with the same complaint. I went
to the Hospital to see them; they all told me FIOW WELL I WAS
LOOKING, and asked me what I was taking. I TOLD THEM
CLEMENTS TONIC, and strongly advised them to try it. They all
promised to get it and try it. VVhat a relief the sufferers will get,
judging by myself. “ (Signed) W. G. SIMPSON.”
Those persons who suffer from Anaemia or Poor Blood, Constipation, Indigestion, Sickness
after Eating, Irregular Heart Action, Nervousness, Sick or Neuralgic Headache, Nervous
Breakdown, caused by over-study or business worries, Kidney Irregularities, should use
Clements Tonic—because it acts at once upon inactive functions and gives them new nerve
force. It rapidly makes men and women healthy. The mission of this medicine is to create
health. ALL STORES and CHEMISTS SELL IT, so that all may obtain it.


A Tonic Free from
Alcohol
Are you pale, weak, easily tired,
and do you lack nerve power?
Ask your doctor if Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla would not be good for
you. He knows, and will ad-
vise you wisely. Not a drop of
alcohol in this medicine. T t
puts red corpuscles into the
blood, gives steady, even power
to the nerves; and all without
stimulation. Make no mistake.
Take only those medicines the
best doctors endorse. Ask your

BONNINGTON’S
IRISH MOSS.
Most chemists and retailers will give you
Bonnington’s Irish Moss directly you ask for it.
Here and there, however-, you will find one who
does not maintain the dignity of the profession,
and who will try to sell you a substitute, on
which he makes a larger profit. You know the
insidious argument, “Yes, I stock Bonnington’s; but have you tried my own
mixture ? It is ‘just as good.’”
Allow no one to deceive you. There is no remedy so good as Bonnington’s
Irish Moss. ’

A Well-Rounded Bosom
Is the Pride and Joy of All Women.
No woman need remain flat and undeveloped, thin. and
miserable. Your weight can be increased, and bust developed
to normal. It is done for hundreds of others, and can be as
readily done for you. If your bust lacks development and
firmness, and your afins, neck and Shoulders are thin and
scrawny, even though your face is pretty, you invariably take
second place to your more fully-developed, full-bosomed asso-
ciates in your own social set. It will always be so unless you
correct the imperfections in your figure. Send a 2d. Stamp
for a Free Sample of Dr. Falliere’s Flesh-Food, and our free
book which tells how. Flesh-Food is harmless to use, and the
treatment rapidly and permanently develops a poor figure to
normal. Thousands endorse it. Full particulars free.

Docking Time.
’Way North is the loom of the South ’Ead light
(O-ho ! for th’ Sydney girls!)
Ah! Polly and Sue, with your eyes so bright—
Full speed! Let us pass where the foam gleams
white,
Where the sea on the South Reef curls!
A month in port, for it’s docking time ;
A month, and with two months’ screw!
And the spree I’ll ’ave will be more than prime,
For I’ll spend my brass to the final dime
With the girls of Woolloomooloo!
I’ve took my trick on a lime-juice ship,
I’ve travelled to Gawd-knows-where,
I’ve chilled my nose in the Arctic snows,
And toiled in the tropics’ glare.
With cracker ’ash and with dandy funk
I’ve built up the inner man,
And salt-horse “j’int” and my “pound and pint”
Doled out by the lime-juice clan!
One time I shipped with a scanty kit —
Two shirts and a pair o’ moles —
And two-pun-ten was a month’s screw then,
A curse to their lime-juice souls!
The old man corfed w’en ’e signed me on,
And tried not to show ’is glee.
From this I guessed that the old slop chest
Was lyin’ in wait for me 1
The upshot was w’en the trip was done,
Th’ skipper ’e ’ad me set.
’E give a corf w’en ’e signed me orf,
And said: “You are in my debt.”
Those rotten days I ’ave left be’ind;
Those ships I ’ave left as Well;
For now I graft on Orsetralian craft —-
The rest they can go to ’ell!
No more I’ll take of my “pound and pint”
In clipper ship, tramp or scow ;
I’ll hug th’ coast, and be proud to boast
That I’m. an Orsetralian now 1
The ’arbor seems like a fairy bower,
The moon she is silver white ;
Ah! Polly and Sue and Liz and Lou,
I’ll give you a treat to-night!
The Sydney lights they are shuttin’ in,
We’re swingin’ round Bradley’s ’Ead ;
I’ve left my screw in Woolloomooloo,
And feel like a man ’arf dead.
Yes, every bean of my ’ard-earned pay
I’ve spent in my drunken sport;
And wot is worse (and it makes me curse),
No liquor I’ve brought from port.
Oh! the South ’Ead light like a star ’as set,
For our ship is ’eadin South;
Now ’er bows dip under, ’er decks are wet;
But, ah ! little girl, I can feel it yet—-
Your last kiss on my ’ot, dry mouth!
(South-and-by-West!) I should give it best,
And I should be feelin’ blue!
But I’ve got no grief on my manifest!
’Oo cares?- —while the world ’as grog o’ th’ best
An’ there’s girls in Woolloomooloo !
AT SEA.

Song in the. Sunset.
A lone light from a fading hill,
Flutters in mists that pass
Through twilight’s perfumed offering
Of rain or sun-warmed grass,
Wide seas of amethyst, and faint
Grey silhouetted hills,
Crimsonly gold peninsulas,
Blue bays the slow sun fills !
While flooded rest engulfs these roads,
This pageantry of night,
What cries across the broadening peace?
Faint flowers that long for light?
What sings where far cloud-empires ride
In seas of changing gold ?
Do sunset’s chorused colorings
Drop song upon this wold?
Does the dim roll of homing drays
Speak to me where I stand?
Or the translucent hurrying
Gauze wings of faery-land ?
What tingling rapture constantly
Calls softly down this air?
I have not known such delicate
Sky-music anywhere!
Through sunset’s falling blazonry,
Through silence and far sounds,
What mystic psalmist magnifies
The peace that here abounds?
Truly, it is my leaping heart,
It is my heart that sings,
Only because she looked on me
With eyes that speak all things.

Reminders.
Do you remember those dead days
When we discovered (this is
Our secret still) that mayonnaise
Went very well with kisses?
Do you remember how we fed
On pleasant toys and ballads?—
Which recompensed, let it be said,
For passing dearth of salads.
Do you remember how I made—
Lord, how the memory rankles !
Glad sonnets, you disturbing jade,
To your delicious ankles?
Do you remember how I swore,
When first I chanced to win you,
That with each kiss I loved the more
The tender heart within you ?
Do you remember how you’d scold
When’er I seemed to doubt you,
And how my dearest dreams 1 told,
And all I thought about you ?
Do you remember who betrayed
My trust, and left me lonely?
You did. But somehow I’m afraid
That still I love you only.

greatest fights ever known in the history of boxing.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tiie Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves ) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be re-
fused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the
publishers. The right to reproduce or translate any
part of the contents of this number is hereby ex-
pressly reserved by the publishers.
The Editor will carefully read and, where prac-
ticable, acknowledge in the “Correspondence” col-
umn all contributions submitted, whether in the
form of Political, Social or other Articles, Verse,
Short Tales or Sketches (those dealing with Aus-
tralian subjects, and not exceeding two columns in
length, or, say, SOOO words, are specially accept-
able), Paragraphs, Letters or Newspaper Clippings.
All communications ivill be regarded as strictly confi-
dential.
Tiie Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS.
when the address is specified and stamps are en-
closed. But no MS. ivill be returned, or preserved,
unless these conditions are observed. When MS. is
forwarded without stamps for return it will be un-
derstood that the copy is to be destroyed if not ac-
ceptable. Personal applications for return of MS.
cannot receive attention. Tiie Bulletin desires,
further, those sending MS. to distinctly understand
that it is not responsible for the preservation or
transmission of MS.
To Amateurs in Black and White.
Anyone supplying to The Bulletin original
humorous or other topical drawings in line or wash,
of sufficient merit and interest and adapted for
direct reproduction, or any interesting photograph
illustrative of a current event, will be paid for same
on acceptance. Any picture containing a good idea,
but unfitted for direct reproduction — i.e., any pic-
ture which has to be re-drawn —will be paid for as a
suggestion only. The conditions under ivhich such
artistic contributions will be received are those

ABOUT SOMETHING WITH A STEAD-
ILY INCREASING HEAD AND
DIMINISHING LEGS.
It was noticed, long ago, that man was fur-
nished with language to conceal his
thoughts. After a similar fashion, in three
at least of the Australian States, he was
furnished with railways in order that he
might be further, to all intents and pur-
poses, from an outlet for his exports than
he was before he had any railways. The
natural purpose of railways is supposed to
be the opening up of the country and the
giving of short and ready access to the out-
side world; but in N.S.W., Victoria and
S.A. —especially in N.S.W. and Victoria —
the builders of State-owned lines have re-
versed the process. In "the early days there
was no land communication except by road,
and foreign trade was done by small vessels
which could enter almost any kind of bay or
river and tie up to any old tree if necessary,
even as they once did at Circular Quay,
Sydney. Then all ports were much the
same, just as are all boarding-houses, and by
reason of that fact settlement _ promised to
spread in a fairly equal fashion over the
country. But presently railways came to
pass, and it was discovered to be possible,
by making lines to one favored outlet and
not to others, to give the one outlet a huge
preference and divert the trade there, to the
immense prqfit of local landlords. Then, as
vessels grew larger and the old casual
method of tying up to a tree became obso-
lete, i't was found possible to give the
favored port a further preference by fur-
nishing it with conveniences for the recep-
tion and loading of big ships, and giving the
other ports" no such facilities. So the ne-
glected harbors stood for a smaller and
smaller proportion of the trade, and in some
cases their old trade vanished altogether.
The districts they represented received a
smaller and smaller proportion of the new
population. Sometimes they, received no
new population at all. Sometimes they lost
the population they used to have. Their
natural coastal outlets can still have cargo
hauled to them by road as of old, but thd
advent of railways has reduced the cost of
haulage all the world over, and goods,. ex-
cept in the case of some special high-priced
varieties such as wool, can no longer stand
the cost of the old methods. When it was a
case of road haulage competing with road
haulage everywhere, the consumer had
to pay the bill, whatever it was, but
now things are changed. It is still possible
to drag produce short distances to the un-
railwayed ports, but they can only collect
from a narrow area, and it doesn’t pay hig
ships to go in for mere scraps of cargo, even,
if the owners cared to risk their costly
vessels ■ in places where little or no pro-
vision is made for them. Moreover, the
roads have often fallen into decay, the
people are few and disheartened, and the
overwhelming influence of the big cities has
got them down. Thus great parts of
N.S.W. and Victoria —often the best parts
—are either stationary or retrogressive.
* * * *
The preliminary census figures go to show
how the big cities are still eating things up
in the three States which have made Con-
gestion an especial fetich. Some of these
figures are as follows: —
Increase op Population, 1901-1911.
Three Congestion States.

Or the figures may be compressed thus: —

and Tas. J ’
These returns, of course, require some ex-
planation. Greater Melbourne has a smaller
population than Greater Sydney, yet it
covers nearly twice the area, and Greater
Adelaide, which has less population than
either, is the biggest of the three. If the
boundaries of Sydney were laid out on the
same generous lines as those of Melbourne
it would take in a lot of populous town-
ships that now stand outside, and would be
a far grander sample of congestion than it
is. Then, New South Wales made an earlier
start than either Victoria or S.A., and had
spread its population over a wider area be-
fore the commencement of railway building
enabled it to blast the outside ports and the
outlying districts with the policy of drag-
ging everything to Sydney. And, moreover,
it has for over 100' years been working
great coal’ deposits on the coast —a circum-
stance which puts it in a different category
from its two neighbors. It was possible to
shut up old wool ports like Jervis Bay and
Port Stephens, and force the wool to go to
Sydney ; for the sheep’s overcoat, an article
that fetches a good deal per lb., could stand
the railway freight. It was impossible to
drag all coal to Sydney for shipment, be-
cause coal, an article which fetches not. very
much per ton, couldn’t stand needless railway
freight. So the great port of Newcastle had
to be allowed to live, else the coal trade
must be abandoned and Sydney left to burn
timber and cowdung, and under these cir-
cumstances the policy of trade congestion
was slightly relaxed. Still, if N.S.W. was
somewhat left behind in the' race for the
honor of being the biggest congester of
everything into one centre, it has certainly
caught up most of its leeweay. And if what
is called Sydney, instead of covering only
05,259 acres, embraced 163,480 acres like
Melbourne, or 168,000 acres like Adelaide, it
would take in so much extra population
that it might possibly win the congestion
laurel of all the world by a nose.
This is, within an infinitesimal fraction,
how the three unwise States and the three
other States stand according to the recent
census: —
Out or Eveey 1000 Population the Number Included
in the Capital City Is
S. Australia ..473 I Queensland.. .. 232
Victoria .. ..450 Tasmania .. ..199
N. S. Wales.. .. 387 | Westralia .. .. 195
Roughly speaking, one-third of the popula-
tion of the Commonwealth is carefully and
purposely crowded into 700 square miles of
ground, and one-sixth of it—the' population
of Sydney and its environs—is compressed
into ‘ less than 150 square miles. That
leaves 2,974,431 square miles for the other
five-sixths. There is nothing else like it on
the face of the earth.
* * * *
This is another record of the progress of
the three States with big cities, set in their
order of congestion

Every census since 1871 thus shows that
more thah half the new population gained
by S.A. was somehow shoved into its big
metropolis. Adelaide is a very beautiful
place, but, all the same, this policy doesn’t
soern healthy. The case of Victoria comes
next: — , „

1901-11 .. 95,651 18,830 114,481
The stupendous city growth of Victoria in
1881-1891 naturally led to the stupendous
Melbourne burst of 1892 and 1893. The
head became so big—mostly with borrowed
money—that the small stomach below
couldn’t feed it, and the infinitesimal legs
underneath couldn’t hold it up. And Vic-
toria is now going back into the old evil
ways, regardless, of the lesson of 1892-3. In
three decades out of the last five, Melbourne
has swallowed far more than half the new
population that accrued to the State. In
fact, it has now got to the point of swallow-
ing S 3 per cent, of the new population,
which is the worst case of avoidance of land
settlement on the Australian record —pos-
sibly on the world’s record, save in cases
where war chased the rural population
into the towns in quest of safety.

New South Wales, as heretofore pointed
out, had more of a struggle with its policy
of dragging everything to the capital than
its two neighbors. It never could kill New-
castle because of the coal trade. It has
more good harbors that had to be _ blighted
and destroyed than Victoria, and it has a
longer coast-line to prevent big ships calling
at. When the building of State-owned rail-
ways came into vogue as a means of in-
creasing the commercial remoteness of the
far northern or southern settler, there was
more old and remote settlement to be dis-
couraged than in other States. Moreover,
for many years Victoria built railways fast
while N.S.W. built them slowly; until very
recently the small State had more mileage
of line wherewith to drag things to Mel-
bourne than the big one had for purposes of
similar draggage to Sydney, so the small
State was the more successful dragger.
Moreover, as already mentioned, the best
efforts of N.S.W. to put all its population
into Sydney have not shown up so well on
paper as they might have done, because the
boundaries of what is called Sydney are so
limited. Still, there is hope for the old Ma
State. It is now building railways very fast
and congesting things into one city like the
very devil. It has at last reached the point
where its big city absorbs more than half the
new population, and the increase of the
N.S.W. people outside Sydney is less than it
was between 1871 and 1891, and hardly any
more than it was away back about 1851.
In other words, N.S.W. has got fairly into
its stride as a discourager of country settle-
ment.
* * * *
The three States with the increasing
heads and the diminishing legs have shown
remarkable steadiness in the pursuit of the
enlarged cranium that leadeth unto destruc-
tion. From 1871 onward this has been the
record: —
Out of Every 10,000 People the Capital City Has
Contained
S.A. Victoria. N.S.W.
1871 . .. 2303 2827 2734
1881 .. .. 3711 3281 2993
1891 .. ... 4159 4305 3386
1901 .. .. 4475 4113 3590
1911 .. ~ 4730 4500 3870
On the other hand, Queensland has followed
with some measure of consistency the policy
of allowing every district the most direct
possible communication with its natural
port. It hasn’t followed it so consistently
as it should, for the vested interests of
Townsville and Rockhampton, both very
hopeless and badly-selected waterside
places, have been allowed to sit hard down
on the claims of vastly superior rivals at
Bowen and Gladstone. Still, Queensland
has built important lines striking inland
from four separate points on the seaboard,
and one or two smaller lines from less im-
portant points. It is quite content that
Brisbane should only hold 2320 out of every
10,000 people as compared with 2379 twenty
years ago. It never congested much, and it
is reducing the congestion it once possessed.
It has a more widely-diffused population,
and is doing more to settle its outlying
regions than any of its neighbors. And one
notable result is that it now shows a larger
percentage of increase than N.S.W., Vic-
toria, S.A. or Tasmania.
* * * *
It is always possible to turn a blessing
into a curse by vicious management. Even
bread may lead to suffocation and water to
drowning. N.S.W. and Victoria in particu-
lar have made all the curse they could out
of their State-owned railways. They have
shamefully degraded and corrupted a great
and noble idea until it seems as if a time
was coming when many people would wish
that the noble idea had never been born or
invented. Private railway companies, in-
tent only on sordid gain, would have built
their own roads just as willingly to Port
Stephens and Twofold Bay and Western-
port and Portland as to Sydney and Mel-
bourne. They would have made them as
straight and probably have run them as
cheaply as if they led to any other place,
and thereby they would have encouraged
settlement where now is desolation. They
would have built wharves wherever there
seemed to be money in the business. On the
other hand, politicians, not looking for pro-
fit from the railways, but using them as a
means to buy the support of selfish and de-
graded city papers and traders and land-
lords, have deliberately turned them into a
means of diverting population from a vast
area of country and laying it waste. They
have even used them, by an iniquitous policy
of differential rates, as a means of destroy-
ing manufactures outside the State capitals
and compelling country industries to move
to the capitals. The cities get their reward
in overcrowding, noise, suffocation and ex-
orbitant rents. The more remote country
districts get their reward in emptiness,
poverty and rabbits. It requires a vast and
dangerous borrowing policy to keep the
game going, but the borrowing policy goes
on vigorously, and the work is achieved
somehow. The population figures of the coun-
try districts for 1911 are not available, but
those for 1901 showed that 13 counties in
Victoria had been losing population and
that 44 counties in N.S.W. were in the same
situation. The great ambition of the rulers
of N.S.W., Victoria and S.A. seems to be to
drag the people off the mountains and the
plains, and out of the small towns which
can breathe the air of the mountains and
plains, and to make them superfluous city
drapers. Even if they can only make their
people city drapers at a heavy less .they
would rather lose money than not make
them metropolitan drapers.
* * * *
How far this process of making the na-
tional head larger and larger in proportion
to the public stomach and legs can go on
without the legs giving way and letting the
head down on to the hard, hard ground no
one can tell. There is no other country in
the world where the head is so enormous in
proportion to the digestion and the ex-
tremities, so there is no precedent to go
upon. But what we do know is that the
worst financial smash in recent Australian
history happened in Melbourne just after
that city had made the biggest effort at
swelled head in all Australia’s records. It
is also worth noting that S.A., Victoria and
N.S.W. are again making special efforts in
the same direction, and that N.S.W. has
just achieved a measure of success _in the
enlargement of the end it wears its hat
upon that it never attained, or even ap-
proached, before. So it is natural to look
for some kind of a fall or breakage shortly.
THE COMMONWEALTH BANK AND THE
McGOWEN-WADE COMBINATION.
A Government bank is a fixed item on the
Labor programme. Yet, when a Federal
Labor Government attempts to carry out the
idea, the State 1 Labor Governments of
N.S.W. and S.A. are two very angry insti-
tutions. McGowen, Labor Premier of
N.S.W., is so especially like a wet and in-
furiated hen in this matter, that he proposes
to bring the matter before the Premiers’
Conference, and combine with the Tors Pre-
miers of Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania
against the Federal Labor Government.
His grievance is the proposed Savings Bank
branch of the Commonwealth Bank, which
must either compete with or swallow up the
State Savings Banks. Yet, if the embittered
McGowen would only emerge from the bee-
hive of his State animosities, and consider
the subject calmly, he might see that it is
hardly worth while sooling his enemies on
to his friends in this manner, and that there
is room for calm negotiation. The situation
may be summarised thus: —
(1) A Government Bank for general purposes is
coming. The Labor programme demands it. McGowen
and Co. have been wanting it for many years,
in theory, at least, just as they clamored in theory
for less borrowing. Perhaps they don’t really want it
very badly, but they had to clamor in theory. Now,
there are four ways of running the Commonwealth
Bank.
(2) It may have Offices in the big cities only, and
be for very long a small and rather unprofitable
shadow of a bank, just as Yassberra is to be the
mere shadow of a Federal capital.
(3) It may, as The Bulletin has suggested, ar-
range to buy up some of the very big joint stock
banks, in which, owing to the fact that the recovery
from past misfortunes isn’t yet complete, there would
be little to pay for goodwill—concerns like the Com-
mercial of Australia, Queensland National, and Aus.
Bank of Commerce. This would give it a wide
and profitable connection immediately, and it might
do a Savings Bank business as well. Curiously
enough, McGowen and Co., who seem to be purely
hostile and not at all helpful, haven’t said a word in
favor of this scheme.
(4) The next way to make the Commonwealth
Bank a widespread and profitable institution, is to
use the post offices as country branches, and depend
largely on a Savings Bank business to cover ex-
penses while working up a general connection.
McGowen and Co. object to this like the very devil.
(5) The last alternative is to leave the Savings
Bank business, to the States, and to open branches
all over the country, and enter into a costly compe-
tition with existing banks, for business which is
already insufficient to go round. That might end
by wrecking some of the weaker private institutions,
and starting a panic, and it would almost certainly
make the Commonwealth Bank a losing concern for
a long while. McGowen and Co. offer no audible
objection, either to this possibility or to No. ,
though both would almost certainly be disastrous to
the Commonwealth Bank, and help to bring the
great principle of collective ownership into disrc-
pute. #
Assuming that the Australian Government
sticks to its decision to go into the havings
Bank business, it is eminently reasonable
that it should want to use its own post offices
as agencies, instead of lending them to tne
State Savings Banks, and doing its own
business in a tent. In that case, there are
two courses open to the State Saving
Banks. They may hand over their busi-
nesses to the Commonwealth, or they may
open offices of their own alongside the post
offices in country towns, and run as rival
shows. If they do, there will be a double
set of expenses to cover, and the pronts win
be so diminished that neither institution ma.
be able to pay much interest to its deposi-
tors for a while. It will be an all-round
sacrifice to State cantankerousness or can-
tankerosity. Of course, the Commonwealth
is almost certain to eat up its rivals in tne
end It will win, because the convenience or
being able to do savings bank, postal, tele-
graph, money order and postal note busi-
ness, in one building, will appeal to the pub-
lic There will almost certainly be a steady
withdrawal from the State institutions, and
McGowen and Co. will have to rush round
and realise securities in haste, and perhaps
at a loss, to meet these withdrawals. Ihe
Tory press of Sydney points out earnestly
to Premier McGowen that, when the
N.S.W. State Savings Bank has to
leave the Post Office, to _ make room
for the Federal concern, it could be
run cheaply by arranging with the Bank
of N S W. and the Commercial Banking go.
to act as its agents. In other words, the
Tory press urges him to enter into an all
ance with Private Enterprise, in order to
make Federal Public Enterprise unprohtable,
and to do this in the. noble cause of Separ-
atism, anti-Federalism, hostility to Australia,
and hatred of the only Legislature in Aus-
tralia which rests wholly on universal sut
frage. If this is done, it ought to mean tne
political death and burial of McGowen.
Holman and Co.

The base of the trouble appears to be
that, in this matter, as with the pubm
ownership of land, many State Labor politi
cians only give sufficient perfunctory devo-
tion to their own principles to enable them
to keep their seats. There are magnificent
chances in N.S.W. for the State ownership
of at least two new cities, but. to all sugges
tions of the sort, the McGowen Governmen
presents the blank stone wall of a great
silence. There was a magnificent chance tor
the Federal ownership of one great city, but
the leaders of the McGowen party were with
those—like Carrutiiers and WADE—wno
preferred that the publicly-owned Bedew
capital should be a mere village. And. on
the present question of public banking,
McGowen is found seeking the aid ot

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Old Truck Shortage.
One day last week Melbourne Age pub-
lished two articles in the same column, cue
headed, “The Harvest,” and the other “Im-
ported Rolling Stock: Will it be Ready?”
They were closely related, though it is pos-
sible that they got together by accident. In
the days of Tait, the v. onderful Canadian
genius who “made the Victorian railways
pay,” there were great economies, also there
was a wonderful series of big accidents. ,
Some of the economies were effected by
saving money in the repair of the permanent
way. Some were done by saving wages and
overworking the men till they wet.' liable,
through sheer weariness, to let any old train
go by under old conditions. Then there
were economies in the repair of old rolling-
stock and savings in the building of new
rolling-stock. There was also miscellaneous
cheeseparings of one kind and another. So
now Victoria is frantically building trucks
and locomotives to drag the next harvest to
market, and as the run-down stock wants
such sudden and wholesale replacement that
the local works can’t do all that is wanted
in time, 40 locomotives are to be imported,
and the department spends most of its time
praying that they may arrive before the
wheat rots. As the Age put it: —
The explanation given by the Railway Commis-
sioners in May last, of their decision that it was
necessary to import 40 locomotives, at a cost of
£185,220, was that the supply of new trucks, by
which it was hoped to avoid a repetition of the waste
of the last harvest , rendered an increase of locomo-
tives imperative.
In other words, the railways were
reduced to such a point of dilapidation that
a lot of last year’s harvest was lost. Now,
in the frantic rush to repair the muddle,
£185,220 worth of work is to be lost to
Australian artisans. But, meanwhile, the
damage has been done. The Victorian
wheat farmers have apparently come to the
conclusion that, there isn’t much joy in
having a record crop and seeing a lot of it
rot on their hands because of the muddle-
ment of imported railway officials and the loaf-
ing of an incompetent Premier. So they have
sown 105,510 fewer acres with wheat this
year than last. That makes still another
loss to the State. Of course, it makes no
difference to the unspeakable Tait, who is
gone, or to the unspeakable Murray, who is
drifting, or being shoved, untidily out of
office. But it matters a lot to Victoria.
That State has difficulties enough without
any needless additions to them. Its popu-
lation keeps growing, and, as the
crowd of business on the lines near Mel-
bourne increases, it takes four trucks to do
the work formerly done by three. And when
there are only four serviceable trucks where
there used to be five, the agriculturist’s out-
look doesn’t improve with the onward wal-
lowing of the years.

Asking for Inefficiency.
According to the Australian Medical
Gazette (20/11/T1), Colonel Purdy,
M.L.’s Director of Medical Services, said, in
his presidential address to the Medical Con-
gress :
There is no sense in training up a soldier to fight,
and, when the day of battle comes, finding he is unable
for physical reasons to do so. A youth of 18 must
have absolutely no weakness of constitution in
order to make an efficient soldier, for he has not only
to march many miles in a day, but he has to carry
a fairly heavy equipment, at least 30 pounds
weight (the regular soldier carries a 601 b. kit), and
after a march of many, miles he may have to fight.
The exigencies of modem warfare demand a very
high physical standard of fitness. At a Wellington dis-
trict Camp, I had several opportunities of seeing men
being trained in the attack, and I am quite satis-
fied that only men of the very highest physical
stamp can possibly stand the modern methods of
warfare.
What is Australia doing to procure men for
its citizen army “of the very highest physi-
cal stamp”? The aqswer is: Dashed little.
Certainly many thousands of boys are being
physically trained, and the health of the com-
munity, which is to say the health of our future
defenders, is being protected by law, so far
as plague, diphtheria, small-pox, typhoid
and various other serious diseases are con-
cerned. There is even a tendency to go fur-
ther in this respect. Only last Friday, for
example, Sydney Telegraph, learning that
a city barman had been discovered pulling
the beer-pump while in the last stages of
phthisis, remarked agitatedly :
The interests of society unquestionably demand
that the consumptive who has become simply a
walking magazine of infection, and even many not
so far advanced in the disease, should be segre-
gated.
Compulsory segregation—regardless of the
liberty of the disease-stricken subject—and
compulsory notification —regardless of pro-
fessional etiquette—are enjoined by law
and successfully enforced in the case
of all the deadlier diseases but one. And
that one is the very disease which a country in
possession of an embryo army should tackle
with particular vigor. Syphilis, the scourge
which has wiped out more battalions than
any gun that was ever invented, is still
the spoilt child of the household of pain.
Humanity’s lesser afflictions are leapt at
and strangled on sight, fortunes are cheer-
fully lavished on cancer research, sanatoria
for consumptives, and so on, but this most
far-reaching and horrible of diseases is al-
lowed to rage practically unchecked. The
inexcusable feature of the tragedy is that, of
all serious complaints, syphilis is perhaps the
easiest to control. There is no doubt that, if
the various States of the Commonwealth
were to make it a notifiable disease, and
see that their health officers and others reso-
lutely followed that legislation to its logical
conclusion, this would become, in a com-
paratively short time, as rare a horror in
our midst as small-pox or plague. If the
reform did no more than dower the Com-
monwealth with an army of “the very
highest physical stamp,” it would be worth
a million times more trouble and money
than it is likely to cost. And the only ob-
structions in the path are the wicked Wow-
ser idea that there should be a hell on earth
for those who sin (a theory which disre-
gards the fact that, as often as not, this
particular hell is inhabited by innocent wives
and children and others), and the Tory, or
time-is-not-ripe person, who fights every re-
form to the last ditch, as a matter of habit.
This continent is so situated that it can be
clean from end to end, if it wishes. How much
longer does it propose to cling to its leprous-
ness?
The Cases of Hall and 'lali and Spratt.
The N.S.W. Select Committee, which is in-
quiring into the High Rents of Sydney, is
certainly getting a lot of information, though
it is hard to say what use it may make of
the substance when its research is finished.
One day recently, it struck two interesting
witnesses —Tall and Hall. Afterwards,
it struck Spratt. Tall was a locksmith, and
Hall a photographer. Tall had occupied
the same premises for 25 years. For 24
years he paid £2 10s. a week. During the
25th year the rent bounded up to £4 10s.;
then £6 10s.; then £7 10s. He thought
this tall enough, but apparently there is no
guarantee that the damage won’t presently
leap up to £l2 10s. The marble halls of Hall
had been rented for 10 years at (1) £2 a
week; (2) £2 10s.(3) £3 —that was four
years ago; (4) £6 10s. a week; and Hall
had to pay a bonus of £lOO to get his ten-
ancy renewed even at £6 10s. Yet Hall had
only 15ft. frontage, and, like Tall, he was
located in the quiet upper section of Hunter-
street, Sydney. Spratt, in the same peaceful
and backwashy locality, told a very similar
tale. He paid £2 10s. a week until Novem-
ber last year. Since then, the price had
whooped up to £3, and then £4 10s., and
finally to £6 10s. Of course, Tall and Hall
and Spratt pay these rents because, if they
don’t, someone else will, and they will have
to go out and leave their business connection
behind them. 'When one-sixth of the popula-
tion of a continent is planted in one city,
competition for good business sites in that
city must be tremendous. Naturally, these
people, and all similar people, have to raise
their charges in order to meet these extra
rents. And that raises the cost of living,
which, naturally, leads to an all-round de-
mand for increased wages. Meanwhile,
banks and other institutions which live by
lending money, have either to lend on the
new and stupendously increased valuations
of the premises of Tall and Hall and
Spratt and their kind, or else go out of busi-
ness altogether. And when the boom bursts,
these institutions will be left as they were in
1893, and a lot of harmless people will won-
der where their savings have gone to, and
there will be another slow, hungry, lament-
able process of recovery—not so bad as the
last one, because there isn’t so much foreign
capital in the country, but bad enough. The
rents of Tall and Hall and Spratt can’t
keep on rising at the present rate without
some kind of a breakage. So far, there is
no hint that the committee sees a remedy
ahead; it is merely listening to the monot-
onous tale of the ballooning of rents. The
figures seem to suggest that the building of
one or two new coastal cities with the State
as sole ground landlord might be a good in-
vestment —in fact, they suggest quite_ a
gigantic possible revenue in that direction.
But the present N.S.W. Government appears
to be so complete and abject a. slave to the
old private landlords of the big city, that
there is little to hope for in that direction.
It spends its time inquiring into what every-
body knows already, and learning what the
community is already aware of. By the
time it has finished, the problem will be just
as unsolvable, along the present lines, as it
was when the investigation began. Of course,
the problem will solve itself to some extent
if left long enough, just as an old building
solves itself in time by falling down.

The Accessibility-to-Sydney Fetich.
A few words from “Henri Singemoine” :
A custom has grown up among the Sydney State
Frighters in the Australian Parliament of estimating
the value of pretty well every place in the Com-
monwealth according as it is close to, or remote
from, the mammoth city on Port Jackson. Expert
opinion declared that Monaro was the best available
site for a Federal capital. Public opinion, wise to
the facts that Monaro has the climate of a health
resort and the finest water supply in N.S.W., agreed
with the experts. The crowd that represents Sydney
interests in the Federal House found, however, that
the place was not close enough to the tail that wags
the N.S.W. dog; and it looks as though the political
centre of this continent will be at tlry and barren
Yassberra. The same crowd has agitated to such good
purpose, that the principal naval base is to be at
Sydney harbor, and it is now protesting furiously
because the Naval College is to be on a headland at
Jervis Bay (which is 87 miles from Sydney), instead
of on a similar headland at Port Hacking, which is
15 miles from Sydney. In the circumstances it is
instructive to draw attention to the example and
experience of England in the matter of naval bases,
naval colleges and things. The R.N. College, at
Dartmouth, has been deliberately placed ,by the
authorities in the most inaccessible spot possible.
The embryo mariner has to journey from London to
Kingswear (five hours in the train), be ferried across
the Dart, and, on arriving at the other side, cart
himself and his gear to the top of the tall, bleak
hill on which the college is situated. The visits of
relatives are tolerated, but not welcomed. The idea
is that the collegians should be as far removed from
the pomps, vanities and distractions of the outer
world as though they were at sea. If it were sug-
gested to the Admiralty people that a better scheme
would be to train the boys within cooee of a great
city, and in the centre of some popular tourist re-
sort, where the hoot of the motor-car and the snort
of the pleasure-launch resounded day and night, and
where Sunday was mostly a day of drink, flirting
and fishing, and the rest of the week likewise in a
slightly modified degree, the answer of the Admiralty
people would probably be contemptuous, if not
violent. In brief, in the eyes of those who are not
blinded by the accessibility-to-Sydney fetich, the
deadliest reproach against the Burraneer site is its
nearness to the beer and blanky and hilarity of the
city trippers, who swarm to Port Hacking and en-
virons. One of the advantages of Jervis Bay is that
it is remote from such things. As regards the drag-
ging of the naval base to Sydney, the example of
England is again useful. In the dim past, when
British commerce was more or less in its infancy, a
naval base was made at Portsmouth, because of its
remoteness from trade. Southampton was nothing
then, but during late years it has grown a huge
mercantile tonnage—a thing never calculated on
when Portsmouth was selected. As a result, the
adjoining waters are becoming more perilous for big
vessels every year. The luxury of having a naval
base up against a teeming commercial centre has
already cost the Admiralty the Gladiator; and the
recent ramming of the Olympic by the Hawke was
due to the same thing. Together, these mishaps will
cost Britain considerably more than £1,000,000;
and there are plenty more in the offing. The ram-
ming of priceless warships and mammoth liners will
begin in Sydney harbor as soon as Australia achieves
a fleet worth mentioning. The unpatriotic Sydney-
ites in the Federal House know this, just as they
know that a hilarious ; camping and picknicking re-
sort is no place to discipline boy-sailors at, and just
as they know that no city of any consequence or
beauty’ can arise on the arid steppes of ’Berra. But
they do not care.

As between Premier Ward and Opposition-
leader Massey, it is really difficult to tell
what the present Maoriland election is about.
Massey declares that Ward is a frantic and
dangerous borrower, and, at the same time,
he admits that he has voted for every Loan
Bill which Ward has introduced. So, appar-
ently, Ward is the blot, and Massey is the
kettle, or else Massey is the pot and Ward
is the coal-scuttle. The most interesting cir-
cumstance is the possibility of a great up-
heaval in favor of National Prohibition. That
would presumably mean that all bars, brew-
eries, distilleries, private bottles, flasks,
drinks, thirsts, shouts, hiccups, jim-jams and
festivities would be made illegal from one
end of the archipelago to the other. Maori-
land would then be about 1300 miles from a
pub, and for once Prohibition would have all
the trial it could ask for. It never did in
Maine and other dry States of the U.S., for
there Was always a land frontier and a keg of
alcohol just over the border.. But with the
next drink 1300 miles away, a truly Pecksnif-
fian island could give its principles a run for
the.r money at last. There wouldn’t even be
the smell of a cork to be heard through the
longest-range telescope —unless some ruffians
started private distilleries among the Alps
or in the fastnesses around the great lakes.
This shows the world’s estimated produc-
tion of gold in five-year periods for the last
40 yeaj-s:—
1871-75 .. 27,955,068 oz. IS9I-95 .. 39,412,823 oz.
1876-80 .. 27,715,550 „ 1896-00 .. 62,234,698 ~
1881-85 .. 39,973,773,, 1901-05 .. 76,732,498,,
1886-90 .. 27,306,411,, 1906-10 ..105,701,290,,
The tremendous increase in production dur-
ing the last few years has been due, mainly,
to the remarkable developments in S’Africa
and Westralia, but largely to the discovery
of chemical means to leach the gold out of
tailings dumps which had been accumu-
lating for centuries. There is room for in-
terminable argument over the effect that this
vast increase in production has had upon
prices; but it is at least pretty generally
agreed that gold, being a much more com-
mon substance than it was 20 years ago,
can’t be expected to be worth as much —ex-
cept for the payment of old debts. In other
words, it is a perfectly natural thing that
prices should move up, since gold, which is
our one standard of value, is a much com-
moner article than it was. The large,
heavy, unintelligent hoot of the daily paper
is aimed at labor unions and “socialistic
legislation” for forcing up the price of com-
modities ; but prices would have sprinted
up even if there hadn’t been any labor
unions, and if the Parliaments had consisted
only of B. Smith and N. Bayles.

A letter from “Sinnik” :
What a painfully embarrassing job George Reid’s
would be for one who hadn’t made a life study of
the great art of Yes-No !
A few days ago, the cables reported him as ex-
plaining to a London audience that the British
Liberals and others who had termed _ the Austra-
lian system of universal service “conscription” as a
means of discouraging emigration to this country,
were distorters of the truth. A few years ago
“Liberalism” in Australia professed the same views
as regards universal service that the British Liberals
do now. And George Reid was their leader, and the
most forceful blitherer of them all concerning the
“un-English” principle of “conscription” said to be
involved.
Last week, Reuter mentioned that Reid had as-
sured a gathering of London financial magnates that
there was nothing crude or revolutionary about the
policy of the Australian Government. The Govern-
ment, he said in effect, consisted of moderate-minded
and enlightened men, who could be relied on to do
the right thing by Society and the Empire every
time. Yet, in 1906, he based his whole claim to
office on the argument that this same band of Federal
politicians consisted of anarchists, disloyalists and
bursters of the marriage-tie.
Two days later, the one-time assailant of “Social-
ism” was found defending Australia’s socialistic
railway system as against the Private Enterprise
railways of England; and on Monday he assisted en-
thusiastically at the launching of Australia’s first
big battleship—one of those vessels which he, in
common with W. E. Johnson and Willy Kelly,
used to claim would be employed ultimately to
blow the British navy to perdition.
Obviously, a Tory politician isn’t suited for the
billet of High Commissioner. The ceaseless banquets
which he is forced to make of his own words, con-
victions, etc., do more damage to his reputation than
the remainder of his duties do to his digestion.
“White Boy” : The Yellow Pup is chafing
on his chain once more, and his dolorous
meat-howl will be a feature of the next
N.S.W. elections. The immediate cause of
the trouble this time is the appointment
of Trefle and Dacey, both R.C.’s, to Min-
isterial position in the Government. Natur-
ally, the Sydney press is horrified at the
influence of Rome, and sees in the appoint-
ments an abject acknowledgment on the part
of the Caucus that an implied compact, at
least, was bound up in the block vote given
to Labor at the general elections of 1910
by the Papists. Indeed, about the only
thing the sectarian-mongers have not dis-
covered is what tangible benefits the R.C.
Church can get out of the appointments,
even supposing, for the sake of foolishness,
that they were made as a quid pro quo. I
never heard that Dacey had ever expressed
the propriety of gilding the Cardinal’s pal-
ace at Manly at the public expense, nor that
Trefle, as Agricultural Minister, is likely
to sow Hyde Park with potatoes for the use
of St. Mary’s opposite. Still, you never
know ; and, in case of accident, the walls of
Derry are being set blazing in 27 different
places.
*
The attitude of the Tory press towards the
N.S.W. Government, in connection with the
Hosicins iron and steel firm, is very charac-
teristic. This firm had a contract to supply
the State Government with steel and iron
under certain conditions, and it also received
a bounty from the Australian Government
under certain conditions. Both Governments
were entitled to inquire if the country was get-
ting its money’s-worth in goods and in the de-
velopment of a young industry.. An inquiry
was held, by a man highly qualified for the
position, a Scottish expert who knew nothing
of our politics, and cared less. His report
was to the effect that the N.S.W.. Govern-
ment was not getting good value for its
money, and that the Australian people were
not getting value for the bonus paid. The
State Government has intimated that it in-
tends to cancel certain contracts with the
Hoskins people, and now there is a howl
that the firm has not had British trial.”
This gag about a British trial grows weari-
some. If somebody contracted to do some-
thing for the Sydney morning papers, and
the papers reserved the right to cancel the
contracts when they thought fit, would they
have a British trial, whatever that may be,
to decide whether the contracts should b£
continued once they (the papers) were con-
vinced that they were not getting, their
money’s worth?

The waily tale of “Hermes” :
I rise to call the attention of the long-suffering
public to the doings of the Amalgamated Stiggins
Society. The A.S. will have to be dealt with. Some
time ago, six small boys, who had wagged it from
Sunday-school at Parramatta (N.S.W.), were found
on the grass in the park, listening to the band. The
churches, which have been damning one another for
centuries, suddenly dropped all their hatreds, and
formed the Parramatta Branch of the Amalgamated
Stiggins, and collectively demanded of the council
that it should prevent the band playing in the park
on Sunday afternoons, and luring Sunday-school
scholars into the fresh air. The council was weak
in the back at the time, and spoke to the band, only
to find that the majority of the people seemed to like
to have the music there. Then it suggested a com-
promise, and ordered the band not to play before 4
p.m., by which time the Sunday-schools would have
finished their deadly work. The band refused, and
played on, defying the council and Amalgamated
Stiggins to prosecute. Nothing happened, except
that some of the parents, whose youngsters had
wagged it, said that, after all, the kids were pro-
bably better in the park, listening to good music,
than hearkening to the Rev. Chadsniff in the stuffy
Sunday-school. At the latest, the council was under-
stood to be trying to urge Premier McGowen to do
something in the matter, and James, the Landlord,
is darkly suspected of belonging to some branch of
the A.S. himself. Then there were the Manly out-
rages, which are widely suspected of lying at the
door of the local branch of the Amal. Stig. The
Stigginses strongly object to surf-bathing, and a
little while ago the life-lines were cut into 20ft.
lengths. No arrests were made, the evidence not
being strong enough. Later, the casualty room of
the surf club was broken into, and all the whisky
kept there to revive half-drowned people was stolen,
and as the Stiggins’s antipathy to der-rink is well
known, this was probably the work of some emissary
of the local branch trying to put it down. What
branch of the Amalgamated Stiggins N.S.W. Chief
Secretary Flowers belongs to is not known; but it
is apparent that he is an office-holder or something
of the sort. Mr. Flowers recently turned his at-
tention to photo, plays, and forced a iabbergasted
picture company to chop to pieces a specially starred
film, because the bad man of the picture story was
shown kissing another man’s wife. It was a most
fortunate thing for Melba that he did not see
“Samson and Delilah,” or he might have blown up
in the theatre. It is a billion to a huckleberry that if
the opera is ever filmed, and shown in Sydney while
he is in office, it will be slain with both official feet.
The censoring of films has reached such a point now,
that unless it is eased off, it will be necessary to
have Mr. Flowers kidnapped on his way to Sunday-
school, taken to a dark room, and kissed by 17
strange married women.

The announcement that Premier Murray
w T on’t retire after all leaves the Victorian
“Liberal” party in a curious tangle. First of
all, there was the electoral campaign, and
while it was on the Murray Government
was held up by the daily press as a strong,
progressive, strenuous organisation, and
Murray himself as a sort of savior of the
country. The Government won, and it was
announced that Murray had resolved to
retire. There arose among the papers which
had supported that eminently tired person
an undisguised readiness to let him retire.
They were sorry in a hurried sort of way,
but they didn’t urge John to remain. Then
it was suggested that he should be made an
Agent-General or a Rhodes scholar or
something—at least, some profitable billet
was hinted at. With brutal frankness it
was explained to Murray, by some of his
own enthusiastic supporters, that he was
too weary and useless for any such billet.
Now, just as The Bulletin goes to press, it
is announced that the infuriated Murray
won’t retire at all. So now the question
arises: Is the savior of the country, who
rescued it so valiantly from the jaws of
Prendergast, to be shoved out by force?
Or is the tired politician who was too useless
to be made Agent-General to be allowed to
stay in?
J. A. Millar, Maoriland’s Minister for
Labor, who, a while ago, talked of retiring to
the shade of his own cabbage, now mentions
in a campaign address that he has the “hon-
orable ambition” to succeed lou Ward as
Premier.
Melbourne Trades Hall Council has dreams
about the establishment, by the Australian
Parliament, of a National Building Society,
with a capital of £3,000,000. It seems about
the maddest time in all creation for such a
speculation. If the Government is standing
by with £3,000,000 to buy up the ruins of
the present institutions when the boom
bursts, that should be a much better
business.
According to the cable, Ernest Terah
Hooley, the one-time tremendous financier
who gave a gold communion service to St.
Paul’s Cathedral, is accused in London of
obtaining £2OOO by unwise pretences. There
was a time when it would have seemed in-
congruous to accuse Hooley of obtaining
less than £1,000,000, but his especially gor-
geous star set a long time ago. Hooley was
a garish person in his day, yet there is a
certain pathos about the idea of a lion being
proceeded against in his old age, charged
with misappropriation of a pie.
In nearly CO years the S. Aus. Assembly
had only had five Speakers, until Harry
Jackson arrived, the other day; and even the
five included “Johnny” Bray, who was in
the chair for less than two years. C. G.
Kingston’s father —George Strickland, but
universally known as “Paddy”—lasted 16
years; he was the first, and in many re-
spects the most notable, Speaker. Jenkin
Coles sat through 21 years. He was a bit
of an anomaly. Personally, he was the
friend of scarcely a member of the House;
officially, he was friends all round. Curi-
ously the Irishman and the Irish-Austra-
lian, alleged on bad grounds to be hot-
headed, have made the best of Australian
Speakers—Terence Aubrey Murray, and
Peter Lalor, and Joey Bell, and “Paddy”
Kingston, and Charles Gavan Duffy, and
Francis Murphy, and Charles McMahon.
And if Jenkin Coles wasn’t an Irishman he
was born in the St. Patrick pub in Sydney
away back in the early ’4o’s.
About an amusing old person:—
Senator Simon Fraser, who turned up again in
Melbourne this week, after another trip to Europe,
bids fair for the doubtful distinction of the Grand
Old Orangeman. Simon will be 78 next year, and he
is still going strong. Pretty soon, he will be com-
paratively young-looking for his age, having passed
the stage in sectarianism where it interferes with the
digestion. He was not more than 55 when he paid
2000 guineas for his portrait, by Millais, which re-
presents him—it is the most artistic bit of por-
traiture in Australia —as a rugged, brown ancient,
with a rueful countenance. His suspicions concern-
ing “Rome” must have gnawed his vitals at that
time. Simon the Yellower is neither Australian nor
Scawtch. He was born in Nova Scotia, and came to
this country as a youth. Traded in taters, built
bridges, and got a cut in a big railway contract.
Then he bought a station property in Queensland,

The Titheradge matinee will happen this
(Thursday) afternoon, at Her Majesty’s (Syd-
ney). It commences at 1.30 sharp. The show
will be about the biggest of its kind that the
city has ever witnessed, yet it can hardly be
big enough to suit the merits of the case.
Those who can’t get in, and it is hoped they
will be many, are invited to be present by
cheque, bank draft, cash, postal note or
other tangible sign of esteem for one of the
finest actors that Australia has ever met
with. These worldly goods may be addressed
to Mr. Lachlan Beaton or Mr. Leonard
Dodds, c/o the Royal Agricultural Society,
Ocean House, Moore-street, Sydney. The
Bulletin doesn’t think much of Dodds as a
name; it is so short and sudden. But it will
look admirable —even heavenly—on an enve-
lope containing £lO or more.
“THE GIRL IN THE TRAINAT
THE SYDNEY CRI.
Sybil Arundale, the
Petitioner in the
comic opera divorce.
W. Tallettr
Andrews , the
new tenor, who
is being divorced
nightly.
A revival of “The Sign of the Cross,” that
irresistible medley of religion, bellow-drama
and eroticism, is luring the multitude to
Sydney Royal, these nights. The role of
Marcus Superhumanus is played by William
Desmond. Desmond is a typical American.
He would be completely at home as Mr.
Barnes of New York, Mr. Potter of Texas,
or Mr. Buffalo William of Cherokee Creek,
Comanche County. His dramatic metier is
to do brave deeds on the quiet, so to speak,
and blush to find the limelight on them ; to
rebuke his enemies in a gentle drawl in pref-
erence to an agitated howl; to be warily
discreet, unemotional, whimsical, humorous
—in brief, he possesses pretty nearly all the
characteristics that the flamboyant Roman
gentleman, whom Wilson Barrett was so
well equipped to portray, does not. He
looks the part well enough, being a fine figure
of a man ; yet, even here, he is under a han-
dicap. He either makes up badly or not at
all, as a result of which he looks no more
beautiful on the stage than he does off it—a
dreadful mistake m the Marcus variety of
role, and one which Julius Knight (say)
would have died sooner than perpetrate.
Miss Dorothy Dix is a lovely and spiritual-
looking Mercia; and Miss Susie Vaughan,
Miss Alma Vaughan, Miss Annesley and
Miss Dorothy Brunton are excellent in their
various ways. J. B. Atholwood’s Nero is
the ablest bit of character-acting in the pro-
duction. Almost, for the few fleeting mo-
ments that Atholwood holds the stage, one
gets a semblance of an illusion of an Im-
perial Roman. Ambrose Manning (Glabrio)
is another w T hose work calls for a subdued
cheer; and the same remark applies, more or
less, to Winter Hall, Cyril Mackay, George
Bryant, F. Cambourne and the scenic
artists.

As faintly hinted or adumbrated last week,
the “Nicola” show opens at the Palace on
Saturday. Nicola is described as an illu-
sionist, psychist and prestidigitateur ; also as
the “Prince of Conjurers,” and the “Napo-
leon of Magic.” And if he likewise proves
to be the Hannibal of Mystery, the Caesar of
Wonders, and the Alexander-Cortez-Pompey-
Nelson of Marvels and Incomprehensibility,
this paper won’t turn a hair. It doesn’t see
why he shouldn’t be all these things and
more besides.

“The Girl in the Train” is still in the
train at the Criterion Theatre, and every
journey the vehicle is crowded, like John-
son’s wondrous contraption on a Saturday
night or the tram car that staggers into the
O’Sullivan railway station what time the
homeward bookkeeper fights his weary way.

At West’s, in Sydney (the Glaciarium),
“A Victim of the Mormons” has been pour-
ing cold shudders down Sydney’s spine dur-
ing the week. Next Saturday, “The Chris-
tian” stalks across the screen and postures
for the eternal welfare of Glory Eugenie
Quayle Duggan.

The launch of the Commonwealth’s battle-
ship Australia is now demanding the atten-
tion of the patriot at the Lyric and Colonial
Theatres. As the country keeps on import-
ing even small coasters from oversea, the
first slithering plunge of a big, locally-built
fighting ship may not be seen by the
present generation. So it is hereby advised
to go along and view the noble performance
at second hand. The arrival of Pug. Sam
Langford and champion cyclists Ivor Law-
son and W. Mitten is an interesting but less
magnificent spectacle.
** * *
Next Saturday, at the Lyceum, a phan-
tom Nellie Stewart will Hit across the
Spencer screen, and offer oranges, without
any substance in them, to a ghostly Judge
Jeffreys. The fine costume drama was re-
cently acted by Nellie Stewart and her co.,
and filmed for Spencer’s in a special studio,
at Wonderland City. The picture is 1000yds.
long, and an hour wide, and the makers
assert they have crowded the whole entran-
cing story into it.

The Du For Trio of male dancers, now at
the Tivoli, provide some smart and elegant
footwork; but their singing must not be
criticised from the grand opera critic’s emin-
ence. Their chief job is stepping, and they
don’t go sky-piloting amongst the top notes
any more than they can help. Comedian-
mimic J. P. Ling shares the centre of the
bill with Johnson and Dean, the joyous
cullud pussons; Ridiculous Recco, the 'bur-
lesque acrobat; and Hanvarr and Lee, the
comedy juggling pair, with the cool, green,
golf links setting. Baritone Ossipoff sup-
plies some good, showy vocalism, to the
finished accompaniments of Miss Zoreema;
and Vaude and Verne assist in the good
cause of amusement, by grilling slowly be-
fore the footlights.

Bert Gilbert is starring at the National
Amphitheatre, just now, and the place has
not suffered such a sensation of repletion
after the evening meal since it started busi-
ness. _ When last seen, Gilbert was • imper-
sonating an elderly gentleman under the
spell of alcohol, and doing it like one who
had observed such phenomena through many
microscopes. Miss Beaumont Collins is still
playing her sketch, “The Leaves of Mem-
ory,” amid loud applause, sobs, etc., and
there are some good musical apd acrobatic
items in the bill.

, Alfred Hill will launch a new composition,
his Sonata in A minor, in St. James’s Hall,
Sydney, on December 1. Miss Palmer’s con-
cert will be the occasion.

“The Chocolate Soldier” will finish his
caramels at Her Majesty’s (Sydney), in a
week’s time. Then the grand opera co. will
come back —on December 11 —and stay for
a fraction under a fortnight. “Romeo and
Juliet” and “Aida” are regarded as certain-
ties for the brief season, and there may be
one or two others in which this co. has not
hitherto been heard in Sydney.
** * *
11. B. Irving, at Adelaide Royal, has
struck a season of warm evenings. At-
tendances at first nights have been big, and
the smaller ones on off nights enthusiastic.
Irving’s study of senility as Louis XI. is
fine, but he produces the hereditary inarticu-
late bellow in moments of agitation. The
final night in “The Bells” brought a scene of
wild enthusiasm. The rest of the co., who
made such a shallow impression in “Ham-
let,” showed better as the season went on.
At the Tivoli (which mostly has the roof off
these evenings), Harry Allister gives some
good impersonations. Gladstone, Edward
VII., and the Pope are, perhaps, his best,
and Roosevelt the weakest. McLallen and
Carson have come back to skate, and Clark
and Hamilton have a good turn. The King's
bill is strong chiefly in acrobatics. West’s
and Wondergraph are both promoting beauty
shows per film. Several of these houses are
making arrangements to spend the summer
in the open air
“ DAME NATURES,"
AT MELBOURNE
ROYAL.
The old aris-
tocrat, Prince
de Chabran
(J. Plump ton
Wilson).
The forthcoming J.C.W. panto, is to be a
very weighty spectacle. The inseparable
scenic artists —Coleman and Geo. Upward—
get to the painting room at Her Majesty’s
(Melb.), with the milk, or thereabouts, and
leave it some time before midnight. Scenery
for “Sinbad” has kept them hard at it for
weeks, and there are a few more miles of can-
vas to be covered between now and December
23. This panto., apparently, will keep more
people employed in shifting mountains, rivers,
castles, fairy forests and shipwrecks than
any previous production of its annual char-
acter.
$ $
The opera season, seemingly, is to l.e
somewhat abbreviated in Melbourne. On
the afternoon of Saturday (9th), a mixed
programme will invite the local populace to
roll up to Her Majesty’s, and lire its last
volleys of wild enthusiasm over the season’s
grave. This week “Rigoletto” and “Otello” —
the latter for one performance only—will be
added to the repertoire. Last week, “Romeo
and Juliet” and “Lohengrin” were the new-
comers, but already those respected identi-
ties have, in J.C.W.’s battered caravan-
serai, abode their hour or two, and gone
their way. Others, such as “Tosca,”
“Faust” and “Samson,” are gone to-day and
here to-morrow, as the late Widow O’Brien
would have moralised. Nothing is certain in
this life save advance bookings and receipts
at the door, all else being variety and vexa-
tion of the financial spirit.
* * * *
“Romeo and Juliet,” having Melba for its
heroine, drew the multitude. Moreover, the
production was almost as good as new to
the majority, for, although Gounod’s opera
was sung by the German co. a few years
back, it was out of their line, and the per-
formance left no impression. Last week’s
performances are remembered with grati-
tude. Gounod’s work —never quite rising to
the Shakspearian occasion, or falling below
respectable mediocrity—is full of melody and
movement. Well staged and dressed, it
needs only an interesting Juliet to make it
a fairly charming opera. And Melba is
always an interesting impersonator of these
young parts. Apart from her vocalism, she
is a great artist, if not a great actress. Her
Juliet has something of girlishness almost,
and she does all things handsomely. Juliet
looks born to purple and fine embellish-
ments, whereas Romeo McCormack, even
in their most illusive musical moments, has
an air of being overdressed. Still, the
tenor’s warble entitles him to much of the
fuss which the lady makes about him.
Burke, as Count Caoulet, is a cold, tall,
tuneful parent, Scandiani a tame Mercutio,
and the interpolated page of the bounteous
Cisneros is a spectacular attraction as well
as a good musical item. The minor parts
are usefully dealt with by Miss Buckman
and others. Kaufmann, too, as the Friar
(who is among the principals) has a sad
and holy facial expression which would help
him to be altogether satisfactory, if his
sympathetic basso notes were honestly ut-
tered. But the unassuming Kaufmann, an
artist in all other respects, sings from the
back of the throat or somewhere, and
sounds as though he were pouring out his
feelings through a muslin strainer
“Lohengrin,” last Saturday, brought Wag-
ner into the procession of composers, and
put him in his proper place at the head
thereof. The slightly augmented orchestra
was sometimes at odds with itself, and the
rest of the performance and the extra double
chorus failed to achieve all the musical and
dramatic effects that one listened and looked
for and got when more practised conductors
were in charge. Nevertheless, “Lohengrin,”
with all its faults of execution, was the
grandest opera of the season. This was
understood to be a great improvement

on what Marshall-Hall conducted in Syd-
ney, though it offered no artistic explanation
why the angular Conservatorium enthusiast
should be asked to undertake a theatrical
job in which he has had no experience to
speak of. Melbourne retains reverential
memories of “Lohengrin” in English and
German. In the matter of tout ensemble
the present revival in Italian comes only
third on the roll of honor. Parts of the
uneven performance are fine all the same,
and, being imposingly clothed and mounted
as of old, the Wagnerian poem shines with
a spiritual light even as the dulcet strains
of “La Boheme” smack of the world, the
flesh and the garlic. The supernaturalism
of “Faust,” and the scriptural pretensions of
“Samson and Delilah,’ look very fraudulent
compared with the mysticism of “Lohen-
grin.” When the son of Parsifal slays
his adversary by merely sticking the point
of his magic sword into an appropriate or-
chestral remark—why, the Holy Grail is
converted into a solemn fact. E!ut no mat-
ter. The Elsa of the forceful Wayda was
rather disappointing, apart from her occa-
sional discordance with the orchestra.
Often she was charming, but not always was
she It. Zeni filled the undemonstrative name-
part surprisingly well, considering that he is
choice Italian, and the Frederic of the versa-
tile Scandiani was so admirable that it
seems unfair to pronounce the Ortruda of
Cisneros even more admirable. They are a
brilliant pair of evil persons. One thinks
of them as Mr. and Mrs. Macbeth. Edmund
Bourke is a severely respectable King—a bit
too much on the elderly side, with a doleful,
drooping moustache. Burke’s distinct lean-
ing to despondency appears mainly in his mo.
this time. Christiani was an efficient
Herald, and all the people aforesaid sang
their best or nearly so, when not interfered
with. For instance, the long third-act dis-
cussion between Elsa and Lohengrin—con-
cerning ivho he is and what he is, and how
they came to be newly married. Both ar-
tists were excellent in this. The realism of
their scene lost some of its weight, however,
in the next act, when the alleged corpse of
Frederic (slain in the bridal chamber)
moved its feet as though suffering from corns.
Un to then, the present writer had felt cer-
tain that Lohengrin did actually kill Frederic
during the pause in his matrimonial dispute.
At the King’s there are two more nights
of “The Prince and the Beggar Maid,” and
then comes a revival of “Camille” for a
week. Miss Duggan and Roy Redgrave
should be able to draw many quarts of tears
in a week from emotional supporters of
Anderson’s theatre, who have always loved
the drama in question, and are apt to call
it “Camel,” because it gives ’em the ’ump.
A new first part is the only recent novelty
at the Opera House. Bert Levy, the Kas-
racs, Zelini. etc., are doing as usual; also,
Bam Mayo is back for a short farewell season,
during which he will chant his lays and re-
sume his former attitude.
THE REAL
ARTIST, AS
SEEN IN
“DAME
NATURE ,”
AT MEL-
BOURNE
ROYAL.
The Repertory Theatre makes its new be-
ginning at St. Patrick’s Hall, on Monday
next. After three consecutive performances
of Ibsen’s “Rosmersholm,” there will be a
pause for one night only, and “Chains” will
happen for the first time on Friday.

According to the programme, Herbert
Darnley is responsible for “His Majesty’s
Guests,” a musical burlesque that trans-
pired at the Princess’s (Melb.) on Saturday.
It seems a sad waste of effort on Herbert’s
part, when one considers that he might have
devoted his talents to constructing artificial
teeth, or making cushions out of cigar bands.
The best that can be said of the amorphous
catastrophe is that, following “The Swiss
Express,” it is like a speech by breezy Jim
Page, after an oratorical monody by Jatv-
bone Webster. The play mostly concerns
the efforts of a number of John Hops to
avoid the trouble and danger of arresting a
number of Bill Sikeses. At intervals, sev-
eral persons intone sentimental ballads, but
the nearest approach to love-making is pro-
vided by a curate who is precipitated into a
state of blithering ecstasy when asked by
the leading lady to remove a tight shoe from
her shapely foot. Most of the show’s weight
is supported by Robert Whyte, who is Ser-
geant Lightning, the boss J. Hop. Although
much of his humor is calculated to make the
judicious howl like a Lost Soul on Judg-
ment Day, there are several bright gleams in
his performance. Anyway, he shines more
brightly than anyone else, although every-
body works hard to make the affair “go.”
Wilfrid Hilary and Miss Edith Jefferies
make a couple of fairly ornamental crook
’uns; Miss Connie Emerald hustles through
a freakish part, and wins approval with her
dancing; and George Story’s curate is not
utterly accursed, so to speak.

“A Doll’s House,” adapted from Ibsen’s
play, transpired at Spencer’s Melbourne
show-place on Saturday. It is a lively item,
and disposes, in two or three minutes, of a
subject that Ibsen took two or three hours to
argue. An excellent picture displayed a
notable method of catching salmon in Swe-
den, while “Through the Wye Valley”
showed a bit of Britain where Nature never
tires of being charming. This week Spencer
harrows the feelings with his locally-pro-
duced “Life of Rufus Dawes,” a film adapta-
tion of Marcus Clarke’s novel.
v *l* »'* q*
A mixed bill of black and white and Ivine-
macolor films drew a throng to the Melbourne
Glaciarium on Saturday. The black and
white pictures are hardly worth mentioning
beside the new productions in “natural
colors.” Of these “The Birth of Spring
Flowers” made a great impression. The
flowers pass through all the stages from
blithering youth to doddering age in the
space of half a minute or less. Another fine
picture was “The Launch of the Olympic,”
and a review of troops by the King and the
Kaiser suggested that in these films of pomp
and pageant the art of Kinemacolor is seen
at its best.
No reasonable citizen asks for anything
more profoundly frivolous in al fresco enter-
tainment than the Follies have been giving
at Taits’ open-air theatre, at St. Kilda( Mel-
bourne) Esplanade. There are seven Follies,
without counting ’ the pianist, and three of
them amount to “dreams” from the audi-
ence’s point of view, and are probably pretty
in private life. The girls have voices and
style, and delightful front names (such as
Phyllis and Mona), whilst the four men in-
clude two positive humorists and a pair of
sentimental ballad singers, one of whom
seems addicted to groaning inwardly. The
concerted numbers are neatly perpetrated,
and the moral tone of the performance is
above suspicion.
“Dame Nature,” at Melbourne Royal, con-
tinues to present a French play, in an Ang-
licised form, to the intelligent admirers of
Ethel Irving’s refined acting. A number of
unintelligent admirers, also, are present every
evening, and these laugh merrily when the
weeping Lolette mentions the word “shirts,”
although the reference to shirts is poignantly
pathetic. Perhaps the misplaced laugh of
the stupid people explains why the play has
been given an ending which is superficially
happy and essentially false. Stupid patrons
of better-class drama must be catered for, and,
considering that the last act of “Dame
Nature” is a sop to stupidity, it will pass as
an artistic composition.
Chinese crews are growing wild, inflated
and bumptious since the Chow revolution
started. The second pigtailed trouble which
Sydney Harbor has seen within a very few
days happened last Monday, on the Netherlee,
where the mariners started “shooting up” all
the white men within reach. None of them
are dead yet. But that isn’t through any
goodwill on the part of the mariners.
The Maoriland elections have been fixed
for December 7, and the man who will be the
most thankful person in the Loanly Islands
when they are over will be Premier Ward.
Joseph has been burning the candle at both
ends, and the middle, for too long in his
desire to do 10 mto’s work, and, unless he
puts the brake on hard, the chances are that
M.L.’s record of sudden death amongst its
Premiers will °-et another advertisement.
This paper cordially invites Joseph to be
no party to any such proceeding.
Poring over the figures of the recent Weary
State election, Melbourne Age made the up-
setting discovery that, in the city electorates,
90,566 Labor votes returned 12 members,
whereas 89.52 S “Liberal” votes got only eight
representatives. This, of course, is wholly
immoral, but it would have looked cleaner if
the Age had decried the far worse irregu-
larity whereby 83,800 Labor votes in urban
and country electorates got only seven mem-
bers, while 168,027 “Liberal” votes were re-
warded with no less than 36. This is the re-
sult of the plan whereby the 7406
electors of Daylesford, for instance, get as
much representation as the 18,720 of Flem-
ington or the 20,610 of Hawthorn. As a
matter of fact, accoramg to the number of
votes polled, Labor should have 25 represen-
tatives instead of 19 in the new Assembly.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Australian visitors who stay at London “private
hotels” are liable to adventures. One such caravan-
serai, in the St. Pancras quarter, was recently
raided, and among those whose sleep was disturbed
were a Church of England vicar and “an Australian
barrister named Marshall.” Both vicar and bar-
rister testified that, as far as their knowledge and
observation went, the place, which was managed by a
lady of 75, was icily respectable. On the other
hand, the police witnesses affirmed that the “hotel”
was used by certain frail Florences of their acquaint-
ance. The Judge took the word of the vicar and
the “Australian barrister named Marshall,” the jury
found the lady not guilty, and the St. Pancras
Borough Council, which sanctioned or suggested the
business, had to pay all costs. It is very suggestive of
“The Magistrate,” in which Mrs. Brough used to be
captured in the raid on the hotel. Her husband,
who escaped by the window, and ran 14 miles, pur-
sued by the police, sat on the bench next morning
with a black eye, and, not being responsible for his
actions, sent his wife arid Titheradge to gaol for a
fortnight without the option.
The cable rumor, since contradicted, that Sarah
Bernhardt was to marry a Flemish actor, 41 years
her junior, recalls her visit to Australia in 1890, when
she was a child of 45. At that time the tall and
beauteous young Darmong, who played Antony to
her Cleopatra, was reported to be her heart’s delight.
He cayaliered her everywhere, and posed .as the
fiancS. The late Myra Kemble tackled Bernhardt as
to the truth of the rumor that her pet leading man
was to lead her to the altar, and Sarah smiled at the
suggestion. “My dear friend,” she.said, “1 am old
enough to be Monsieur Darmong’s mother,” or
French to that effect. Now, well over 60, she has
been wrongfully charged with meditating a partner-
ship with somebody young enough to be her grand-
son. On the Other hand, Ellen Terry, Lady Randolph
Churchill, Baroness Burdett-Coutts and Adelina Patti
are notable satires on the hypocrisy of their
commonplace sisters, who affect horror at the mar-
riage of an elderly male with a blushing flapper.
The attitude of a commonplace old lady is due to
the fact that Hymen gives her no hope.
Died last week, John Gordon, one, of J.C.W.’s best
knowri and most effective scenic artists. He was born in
London, but came to Australia early with his parents,
and learned the business from his father, George
Gordon, who travelled here with the London
Comedy Co., under Garner. G. S. Titheradge was a
member of that co. John Gordon was but 39 when
the curtain fell.
“Harrison O” : In the Melba opera- co.’s production
of “Romeo and Juliet,” the performers in most of
the parts were physical misfits. It did not carry
conviction to see Scandiani (looking extremely
“fit” and capable of taking care of himself) killed
in a duel by Quesnel, whose Tybalt was a particu-
larly small and frail-looking warrior. Melba was
a matronly Juliet and McCormack an unromantically
obese Romeo. Rosina Buckman was an obviously
youthful old nurse; and Eleanora de Cisneros, as
Stefano, looked less like a page than a complete
volume.
Apparently N.S.W. Chief Secretary Flowers, who
has been carrying on a crusade against all but the
mildest forms of kissing in cinem. films, has been
weeping up the wrong tree. While he was having
the cuddle taken out of foreign and locally made
films, the -Amurkan Injun was allowed to burn down
houses galore, in these pictures, much to the excite-
ment of the local juvenile imagination. In fact, two
youngsters at Kurri Kurri (N.S.W-). were so ex-
cited that they donned paint and feathers, and.
starting out on the war-path, set fire to and burned
down a real house. They were fined ss. each. So
now Flowers is wiping the sweat from the great
upstanding cliff of his brow, and wondering if he
has not taken on too large a contract altogether.
“Jean Sibi”: Recently went up at the A thence,
Paris, Monsieur Pickwick, an ungovernable French
farce adapted from Dickens’s “Pickwick Papers.”
The show runs to five acts, but is mostly a collec-
tion of cakewalks and innuendoes. There is a cake-
walk after the Christmas dinner at Manor Farm, and
Jingle, an incredibly Parisian figure, does a cake-
walk and sings a song. Mrs. Bardell is suggested as
a bit of a hussy, with an illicit affection for Pick-
wick. Most unwarrantable of all, Rachel Wardle
is supposed to have passed purple moments in the
company of Jingle. The author, it seems, had no
use for Stiggins and old Weller. Probably finding
that the pair didn’t lend themselves to immoral
adventure, he left them out.
Baritone Bottoms is returning to Melbourne with
three or four years of Italian culchaw in his estim-
able warble. Bottoms is the Bendigo boy who ap-
peared in operatic scenes of yore under Conservator-
ium management, and was billed as Ben Digo because
his proper name had a basement sort of sound. He
had a richer quality of voice than either of the prin-
cipal baritones in the Melba Opera Co., anyhow. If
it has profited by Italian experience in opera he
might make an impressive re-appearance anon, as
Signor Tops.
Mrs. Cisneros and some members of the Whiting
fry were motoring at Mount Macedon recently, and
nearly took a short cut to the heavenly choir. The
vehicle turned turtle, and tried to leap on them with
all its weight, but just missed.
Gaby Deslys, the pretty Parisian friend of Manoel,
the Chucked Loyalty of Portugal, is lightly referred
to as “Her Majesty” on the boulevards nowadays.
She has just secured a New York engagement at
£4OO a night (or less), and, to keep herself warm in
her new job, has taken along' a small wardrobe,
which includes “80 stage dresses, 48 cloaks, and 40
hats; also, 05 packing-cases, packed with sundries.”
A few small souvenirs were forwarded to the col-
lector of kings and crown jewels. Mixed up with
the parcels and flowers she found a motor-car, a

A furnished castle and a set of golf links were un-

From the Great Smoke: Bringing old comedies up
to date, and re-dressing them in 20th century fash-
ionable garments, is good business when it is well
done. London’s latest musical comedy, “The Spring
Maid,” is really Oliver Goldsmith’s “She Stoops to
Conquer,” with a garnish of lively music, splendid
scenery, expensive dresses and gorgeous uni-
forms. On the first night at the Whitney
Theatre, the audience tried to keffp one eye
on the stage and the other on the conductor,
Max Bendix. Instead of sitting in the conductor’s
seat, Max pranced between the orchestra and the
front row of the stalls, disdaining a baton, and
furiously conducting with both hands. It vaguely
suggested that old story of how the rest of the camp-
ing-out party found Marshall-Hall standing on the
rock at midnight, dressed in his wild hair and his
shirt, and conducting the thunderstorm. The gallery
didn’t like it, and said so. After the fashion set
in “The Merry Widow,” there must be a waltz in
every musical comedy now, and the one in this
piece, “Day Dreams,” haunts you for days.
“J.F.H.”: Carrie Moore for threepence! She was
not quite as cheap as that in her native Australia.
Neither is Melba, who sang to a huge sixpenny
crowd at Blackpool, the most popular seaside resort
in the north of England. We must go to England
to hear our favorites on the cheap. Carrie Moore,
at latest, was doing a turn at the Bedford, a London
suburban twice-nightly music-hall, with a threepenny
gallery. Tittell Brune is also in London suburbia
—at the Coronet, Notting Hill—playing lead in
“The Woman in the Case.” She is now billed, or
bills herself, as “the Great Australian Actress” —-
which shows that “Australian” is a better advt.
for an actress in England than “American.” This,
when you come to think of it, ought to make many
a poor-Australian gusher over the imported article
feel pretty mean.
“Ami”: Hilda Spong, just back with laurels and
things all over her, was one of the sweetest Titanias
I ever saw in George Kignold’s production of “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream.” George was Bottom on
that occasion, and Cyril Iveightley, Drury Lane’s pre-
sent leading and beauty man, was another member of
the cast. Close up, in point of charm and merit, was
the somewhat later Titania of Norah Kerin, the Jewess
with the Hibernian name.
Melba, it seems, cabled to Saint-Saens an inti-
mation that his opera, “Samson and Delilah,” had
been successfully boomed in Australia. Consequently,
the composer wrote to Melba desir ng her to “thank
all the great artists who have made my work a
triumph,” and his letter has been duly paragraphed.
What a woman of business is the only Melba!
Harry Rickards got large obituary notices in the
London papers. His age was mostly given as 65;
but “Tristram,” of the Referee, thinks the figure
nearer 75. “Tristram,” who knew Rickards as far
back as the early ’6o’s, when he made a hit with a
song entitled “Oxford Joe,” was with him a few
evenings before his death at the Coliseum, watching
and applauding Albert Chevalier, whom Harry was
very anxious to secure for Australia.
Little Weedon, an ex-Gaud Mayor of Mel-
bourne, is about the saddest busy buzzer in
the city these times. Dean Phelan declares
that the Catholic vote unwillingly ejected
him from the State Parliament because he
had turned Wowser on the Bible-in-State-
scliools question, and, furthermore, Weedon
suffered the awful indignity of being beaten
on the preference count by a person named
Farthing. Also, he feels that his precious
title assisted the result. Somebody flooded the
electorate with cards advising voters to sell
the Knight for a Farthing, or put a Farth-
ing in the slot and get out a Knight, or
words to that effect. It makes poor little
Weedon feel that he went very cheap.
From London: —
When Lord Dudley decided to go to Australia, as
Governor-General, three years ago, London was
amazed. The salary was £lO,OOO a year less than
he had been getting in Ireland. The new job offered
no opportunities for gaining distinction, since the
G.-G. is notoriously pretty much of a puppet in the
hands of his Ministers. The theory that he wanted
to economise carried no weight. It costs more to
give the numerous small entertainments which Syd-
ney and Melbourne expect, than the few big affairs
that satisfy Dublin.
Now, a more or less likely explanation of the
mystery is being whispered about. In 1907 Edward
Vll.’s bronchial and other troubles began to grow
acute. The doctors warned him that he badly needed
a change to a warm, dry climate, preferably that
of Australia. It was suggested that public alarm
would be soothed if it were explained that he was
visitiner the Commonwealth owing to his burning
love for his Australian subjects, or some diplomatic
tarradiddle of that sort. The Dudleys were among
his most intimate friends —the people, of all others,
whom he would wish to entertain him during his
stay. So far as Lord Dudley was concerned, the
arrangement looked promising. If a mere Australian
Mayor earned a knighthood by giving a reception to
the heir-apparent to the throne, an English Earl
might reasonably expect a dukedom for looking after
the Sovereign himself. So all hands Were pleased
and expectant, and the Dudleys came to Australia.
The King died, and immediately everything was
changed. The disappointed G.-G. lost all interest in
his job, and started to dream of resignation.
“Society,” infuriated at the absence of balls and
dinners that was distinguishing the Dudley regime,
started searching round for bricks to hurl at the
G.-G.’s character —its invariable habit when its
mouth is not stopped with food and drink. The
absurd divorce lie was set going. Dudley, who had
practically arranged his departure, had to alter his
plans, and live the scandal down. When he did get
away he was a very dejected potentate, who had
gained nothing but an unmerited flood of libel and
slander, and wasted three years doing it.

In the characters he has played in Melbourne, Mr.
Blank has always played the gentleman. His Bill
Smith, art student though he is, associate of reckless
livers and models though he is, is always a gentle-

Let coarse plebeians snarl and rave,
With bitter venom pent,
The answer to each gibing knave
Is: You assail a Gent.
What though his Art be not the kind
That folks term Heaven-sent!
Carpers should bear this point in mind :
He is a perfect Gent.
Mayhap his voice suggests the scream
Of calico, when rent:
Who cares? His tones melodious seem
To those who love a Gent.
Crude work is pardoned on the spot:
Aye ! hearty cheers find vent,
When Blood offends—such is the lot
Of each true actor-Gent.
And thus we get this striking fact:
The Stage is neatly blent
Of Common Blokes who merely act,
And those who act the Gent.

A kinematograpliic target is the invention
of Charles Sutherland, of Melbourne, who
lately lured Senator Pearce and other hon-
orable Reps, to the Engineers’ Depot on
Yarra-bank, to witness a demonstration of
the novelty. The “kine” target is the cutest
of things. Little soldier figures move about
against a landscape or seascape background,
and shoot at the assembled targeteers from
cover. When a marksman’s bullet strikes
the target the figures stop, and the result of
the shot is marked by a point of light—the
picture being darkened for a moment.
Sutherland’s novelty seems bound to become
popular. It appeals to the murderous in-
stinct of the rifle shooter, and is equally edu-
cational and amusing.
NEEDLESS
LABOR.
THE SPORT (bitterly): “ Why did you tell Miss
Browns on that I was an ass?”
THE GIRL : “I didn't tell her. I took it for
granted that she knew.”
The fact that Campbell Nairn Moir, who
has been arrested and charged with the mur-
der of old Henry Trevascus, of Sydney, is a
mere married youth of 22 or so, has set a
lot of amateur detectives thinking of the
futility of either the police or the criminal
classes. The fact tnat he is alleged to be a
dentist’s assistant is also an annoying cir-
cumstance'. Old hermit Trevascus was found
very dead in his room in an ancient rabbit-
warren of a building at Glebe, Sydney. He
hadn’t gone out for days to buy his usual
solitary loaf, and a notice on the door said
that he was away at Goulburn, and wouldn’t
return for some time. Among his belongings
was found a letter from a man who professed
to be a dentist, with metal for sale. Assum-
ing that any intelligent criminal would give
a wrong account of his occupation, many
people assumed that the writer, if found,
would prove to be an elephant-trainer, or a
local preacher, or a tram-conductor. Yet the
man whom the detectives have roped in is
alleged to be something in the dentistry line.
If he is the right man, it seems to suggest a
grievous capacity for muddlement. And the
fact that the detectives, having got hold of a
letter from an alleged dentist, went looking
for a dentist instead of a whale-fisher or a
tailor shows either that they know crim-
inals to be a simple lot, or that they are a
simple, ordinary lot themselves. Again, there
was a story about how a thud was heard in
Trevascus’s room —presumably the thud
which the deceased made when he fell —and
how, immediately afterwards, an agitated
young man rushed into the shop downstairs
and borrowed a piece of paper. Later, he
rushed in again, and wanted a larger piece of
paper. Presumably, he wanted the paper so
that he might write out the notice which was
found on the door—the one which explained
things to inquirers, and secured the mur-
derer a start. According to all the rules of
the game, this rushing and conspicuous per-
son should have been a woman, or
else a middle-aged man, carefully dis-
guised so as to look young. He was,
apparently, trying to draw attention to
himself and impress his apparent youth on
the people he met, so he should have been
trying to impress them with a bogus identity.
On the face of things, he was either dis-
guised or an ass. A disguised person is hard
to find, while an ass is easy, and the police
took the line of least resistance, and assumed
that he was an ass. They reckon that their
inference was correct, and if it is, a lot of
the joy will be knocked out of the Sherlock
Holmes variety of literature.

“Brass Button”: Why is it that
there is only one man from whom
absolute infallibility is demanded? It
isn’t because the shipmaster’s mistakes
result, or may result, in loss of life.
If an accident happens to the ship under his
charge it doesn’t matter whether any one
is corpsed or not —he is hauled up and his
certificate is suspended. The bitterest pill is
not the loss of his job for the months of sus-
pension, but the absolute damning of his
whole career. No extenuating circumstances
save him. He may have been on the bridge
in dirty weather for 24 hours on end, and
then have been simply driven to turn in and
leave the ship in charge of a junior; yet if
the junior makes a mistake, and pokes an-
other vessel in the ribs, or bumps into a
rock, it is the skipper who has to stand the
racket. That skipper may be the finest
sailor afloat. He may take his ship voyage
after voyage through death-traps without
end; but all that counts for nothing against
one mistake. Fogs, unexpected or unusual
currents, a careless or incompetent hand on
the lookout —nothing counts. Is there any
man in any job so cruelly handled? A
judge or jury may condemn and hang a man
who is afterwards proved to be innocent.
The Judge isn’t punished or reprimanded
or even tried for his mistake, and no jury-
man’s name is struck off the rolls. But the
captain—Crucify him !
Last week, the N.S.W-. Court of Sea In-
terrogation, sitting at Newcastle, said, in a
calm, horsehair voice, it was strongly of
opinion that, when the course of the little
steamer Port Stephens was altered, just be-
fore it shot the breakers, most of those on
board were asleep. The first mate admitted
having.left the coaster to steer itself while
he went below and shook the helmsman.
That person, he says, didn’t answer him, and
failed to turn out until an hour later. The
helmsman appears to have rolled up eventu-
ally in an advanced state of yawns, and to
have draped himself on the wheel in the
moonlight. The next thing, the little vessel
was steeplechasing inshore over the breakers
at right angles to its proper course. A
retinue of sharks attended it to the beach
and gazed reproachfully over the stern; but
the crew just slid over the side on to the
dry sand, and wondered how the blazes the
ship had done it. However, it was its last
performance. Last week, the big seas
punched it further inshore, and it was aban-
doned as a wreck. The master has been
found guilty of navigating without due cau-
tion, and is to show cause, on December 4,
why he should not be suspended in a ham-
mock for six months on full salary. At
least that looks a more sensible conclusion
than the proposed unpleasantness about the
weary mariner’s ticket.
“J.F.H.’s” note from London about a
“' e has
“Charley B.” a. the .allots call him, otherwise
Lord Charles Beresford, is reputed to have upset an
alderman in the streets of Sydney one Saturday
night, when he was on shore-leave with several other
larky middies. A more creditable feat of “Char-
ley’s,” when he was in Australian waters, was his
ascent of the highest mountain in the New Hebrides
which deed is on record in the Transactions of the
Royal Geographical Society. “Charley” has for
years been at daggers drawn with Admiral Lord
Fisher and the ruling clique of the Admiralty. In
a book just published here—“ The Betrayal”—he
goes for Fisher and Co. like a buck nigger after a
white boxer. Among other things he alleges that,
because he felt it his duty to point out the rotten
state of the navy, he was ordered to haul down his
flag as Admiral m charge of the Channel Fleet a
year before his tune had expired. “The Betrayal”
is a record of a 10 years’ fight with the Admiralty
“to secure adequate defence of the country and Em-
pire,” and it is making something like a blaze for
the moment.
DECLINED WITH THANKS.
MAN OF THE HOUSE (to departing charwoman): “Here's a pretty good pair of old pants
of mine. Perhaps you might know of someone who’d be glad to have them .”
CHARLADY (indignantly): “Excuse me, sir, but the ladies and gents as I knows don't
wear second ’and pants.”
When the Lord took a sudden dislike to
Eli, He dealt it out to that misfortunate
Hebrew in a way that made the ears of all
who heard it tingle. But the way the Lord
dealt it out to Eli was child’s play com-
pared to what will probably happen to
Chang, the Manchu general in charge at
Nankin, China. The rebels recently ran
short of ammunition, and Chang > scored a
win which he couldn’t follow up (though
a better man wouldn’t have stopped for a
trifle like that), because he had only 20,000
men against about 35,000 pigtailed republi-
cans. So, having spare time on his hands, he let
his hordes loose on the people of Nankin,
because in the mass they sympathised with
the new disorder of things. After filling
the streets with dead and wounded, his
hilarious followers set fire to the town, and
for the second time within a century Nan-
kin was just about wiped out, and 140,000
people left homeless. Even the women armed
against Chang after that, and the very dogs
fought him. But four times in a week he
beat republicans women, and dogs. Now
he is surrounded, his ammunition is running
out, and his force of over 20,000 men has
shrunk to a terrified gang of 10,000. Even
if he wins four more battles he will be lost,
for he will have no army left. Then the
story of what happened to Chang will be
written at length, and the things that Hap-
pened to Jones won’t be a circumstance to
it. Jones, of the Comedy, lost his coat-
tail. Chang, unless he flees to the utter-
most ends of the earth, is likely to lose
everything that makes a coat-tail worth
having.

“Jack Shay”: The motor-hog puts in some

smooth thoroughfare, where there is little
traffic —just the place where the motor
animal can get up speed and go along with
a great disturbance of wind in front, a roar
all around, and a pillar of dust behind.
There is a “walk past churches” law on
Sundays. Why not a “walk past, hospitals”
law for every day of the week? And let the
buildings that have to be walked past be
painted red, so that the strange hog cannot
pretend ignorance of them; no other build-
ings to wear the crimson hue, under heavy
penalties.
“Brass Button”: The White Star liner
Belgic, which has just been put on the Aus-
tralian run, has flown three flags and wal-
lowed under three aliases. It was built by
the New York Shipbuilding Co., so by birth
is a full-blooded Yank. In those days when
you called out “Mississippi” and whistled,
the ship barked and came to you. Later on
it was taken over by the Soc. Anon de Nav.
Belge-Americaine of Antwerp, and changed
its name to Samland. Finally, the White
Star bought it, and painted up “Belgic” on
the front door This is not the only horse of
its kind in the White Star stable. The Cre-
tic used to be the Leyland liner Hanoverian.
The Gothic was first a White Star boat of
that name, but it was sold to the Belge-
Americaine Co., and re-baptised Gowthland.
Then it was bought back by its old owners,
and resumed business in its original capa-
city. Now, if one of these ships gets a
drink or two on board and is asked for its
name and address it has to scratch its head
and do a long think.
THE CLEANSERS AND THE CLEAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At Wellington (M.L.), to-day, the Rev. Mr. Erwin
said the Church was suffering from the curse of re-
spectabili ty.—Arg us.
The Church is nice and clean and trim,
It wears the smartest bib;
The parson (east an eye on him)
Immaculate and glib,
His surplice wonderfully starched,
His coat supremely right,
His eyebrows accurately arched,
His hands so clean and white.
And, outdoors, in his dusty shirt,
The grimy sinner shifts the dirt!
The pastor prates of “cleansing sins,”
Of “washing white as snow” ;
And bright and clean as new-made pins,
Sits each contented row.
No speck of dust rests on the pews;
The carpets of the aisle
The ladies’ dainty little shoes
Can’t possibly defile.
And at her tub in easy call
The washerwoman washes all!
The Church is only for the blessed,
The bright and shining ones
Who quite respectably are dressed,
Earth’s fat and favored sons.
In goodly cleanliness the toffs
Take quiteSa holy pride.
The tireless highway cleaner coughs,
And sweeps and shoves outside —
The murky, much-despised machine
That, cleansing them, can ne’er be clean.
VICTORIA.

“Tiaki” looks upon the wine when it is
idiotic: —
Some eight or 10 years ago, one W. G. Lamb, of
Masterton (M.L.), determined to compete with Euro-
pean wines (which, in many cases, are merely the
washings of grape pulp, doctored and dyed to imi-
tate the genuine article). He planted eight acres
of choice vines, and after years of solid appF cation,
his labor was rewarded by a smiling vineyard. For
some time the inhabitants of the surrounding district
were able to enjoy the genuine article at 2s. 6d. per
bottle, as against 6s. per bottle for the imported
“pinkev.” Then No-License happened along, and
Lamb, "in order to be certain of his legal position,
had proceedings instituted against himself for sell-
ing liquor in a No-License area. Previous to the test
case it had always been held that No-License did not
prohibit the making and sale of wine by an estab-
lished vintner, but the Chief Justice held that the
making and sale of wine in the “dry” district was
illegal. The only alternative was to erect a depot
in the nearest license town, and have the goods
stored and sold from there. Practically, it amounted
to this; Lamb’s neighbor, wishing to buy a dozen of
port, must select his dozen, see it off for a jaunt in
a cab, cart or wheelbarrow to Carterton (the nearest
license town), and have it brought back to almost
the very place where it was despatched from, be-
fore he is allowed to draw a cork. These harassing
restrictions knocked the stuffing out of a once flour-
ishing local industry, and the eight acres of vines
have been rooted up. Another result of the Court’s
rlecision was that the State farm and other viticul-
tnral institutions had thousands of pounds worth of
planted-out vines left on their hands, as vintners de-
clined to stand the risk of No-License being carried
in their localities. Meanwhile, foreign wine, which
very frequently isn’t wine, is pouring in with re-
newed velocity, at the old high nrice.

“Hercules Battleaxe” throws his mace
through the window and howls his protest: —
A number of sedentary people in sad, black gar-
ments, presided over by a venerable archdeacon, got
together in a clump last week, until they formed a
sort of blot. The blot murmured for awhile; then
gradually the blemish on a fair city vanished, as if
some great hand had held the corner of a blotter to
it and sucked it up. No trace remained on the
meeting spot; but, next morning, the daily paper
was stained with a brief paragraph which stated
that the new crusade against Tattersall’s sweeps was
further considered yesterday at a meeting of the
social questions committee, and that the following
motion had been carried unanimously:—
“That this committee will be prepared to sym-
pathetically consider further legislation by the
Commonwealth Parliament with a view to the pre-
vention of the circulation throughout Australia of
Tattersall’s circulars, and to co-operate with other
churches in a general agitation against a continu-
ance of the Tattersall’s lottery in Tasmania.”

Adelaide bas a citizen who is given to
argument. This is his latest: As he sat in
a “toast-rack” car, the conductor on the
footboard asked for his fare, but couldn’t
reach him. Neither would he pass down his
fare; he had once lost money that way, lie
said, so the conductor must come for the
coin. The conductor said he would have
to tread on ladies’ feet to do that; and, any-
way, he wasn’t allowed to leave the foot-
board. Finally, the motor man was called
in, and the defendant was removed, still
protesting that he wasn’t offending, and
would like to pay, only the conductor must
come to him. For the “assault” he claimed
£450, and a court has given him £35. The
only permanent result is likely to be a fresh
by-law added to the Trust’s already long
lisi.

The fact that another coroner has consid-
ered it his duty to denounce the medical eti-
quette that prevents one doctor attending
another’s patient, in ease of sudden collapse,
suggests that the time is ripe for raising
Cain. In the scheme of things doctors hold
a high position, and, apparently, as a class,
they are getting the mountainous cranium.
It looks as though the community will have
to do something in self-defence. At the
present time, one can rage from one end of
Sydney to the other on a Sunday or a Sat-
urday afternoon, and not find a doctor avail-
able, except a few enthusiasts who devote
their spare time to reading. And yet it
ought to be possible to arrange that a suffi-
cient number will be on duty in strategic
positions, so thdt the whole city will be gar-
risoned, so to speak. The community has a
right to demand that medical assistance shall
always be reasonably available, and that
blithering idiocy about butting into another
man’s practice shall not be allowed to jeopar-
dise life. In fact, doctors should be
licensed, and, if they wilfully do anything to
jeopardise human life, or fail to do any-
thing that might save it, the license should
be cancelled or suspended. You suspend a
solicitor’s certificate; when he runs the trust
funds on the rocks, and a captain is liable to
be. struck off the rolls when he lures false
witnesses on a lee Shore. Why shouldn’t a
doctor be disqualified if he steers his patient
so badly on a calm night that his innards are
left stranded underneath a lighthouse in the
Full Court, for instance?
The Vic. railway department's gravitation
scheme has gone seriously wrong. The mar-
shalling yards at Tottenham and Wallan, on
the Northern and North Eastern lines, are
almost completed, and the rails were about
to be laid on the “shoot” at North Mel-
bourne, when the blessed bank, built on what
was once part of the West Melbourne
swamp, began to sink into the alluvial ooze.
Also, it keeps on sinking, and for all anyone
can say may disappear into the bottomless
pit before it stops. Considering its' many
disasters of late years, it looks as if there is
a well-grown Jonah somewhere in that de-
partment.

“Melb ” writes about an old estate
The cutting up and auctioning of George Coppin’s
Pine Grove estate has just been effected, somewhat
hastened by the demise of Mrs. Rignold, who was a
Miss Coppin. There are still a number of the family
left, and it is found best to realise. This is the second
Coppin subdivision. When James F. Palmer, Legis-
lative Council President, died, about 40 years ago,
Coppin bought his fine estate by the Yarra, re-
christened it St. James’s Park, and cut up and sold
it at a high profit. The names of its little streets
perpetuate the various members of the Coppin family.
This was the first cut-up of a Melbourne family
estate, and appears to have led the way for the pro-
cess in regard to every other. The delusion of
wealthy men, in the earlier time, was that they
would establish mansions and grounds to continue
intact with the family. This has been frustrated in
every case, such as Palmer’s, O’Shanassy’s Tara at
Hawthorn, Glass’s palace at Flemington (Glass
broke), Moore’s Charnwood at St. Kilda, Browne’s
Como at South Yarra, Jackson’s Toorak, McCoy’s
Maritima and McMillan’s Landcox at Brighton,
Clarke’s Cliveden at East Melbourne, Sargood’s
Rippon Lea, Martin’s Banyule at Heidelberg, and
poor little Fawkner’s Pascoevale. I had the pleasure
once of visiting Coppin at Pine Grove. He had an
immense and mysterious statue of Shakspeare under
the verandah. It was a wonder to the public how
he held on at Pine Grove, after the shock to his
Melbourne bank, when Harwood and Stewart were so
dreadfully ruined, and when Greville floated up so
remarkably, leaving £13,000. Coppin’s creditors
must have been merciful, in view of his noble con-
duct on a former occasion. He went insolvent in
Adelaide about,, 1849. After he had made the rise
with G. V. Brooke, and when years had elapsed,
he gave a banquet to his creditors. Every creditor
found a cheque in full payment on his plate. So
Coppin must not be called the Artful Dodger with-
out reservation.
On her own evidence, there was a lady in
the Melbourne Divorce Court, last week, who
ought to be worth £lOOO a year as Public
Discoverer of Clues. She married in 1902;
and after four years’ bliss (or otherwise) at
Dookie, the man faded away. She presently
located him in Camperdown, and followed
him; but he vanished without kissing her
good-bye. She next heard of him at Bala-
clava, and promptly packed up her two chil-
dren and other belongings, and followed him.
After that, the leg-weary woman pursued
him to Stawell, Yarram and goodness knows
where else. Finally, her persistence got on
his nerves, and he gave her £2, and took a
ticket for Maoriland under an assumed name.
She smelt out the plot, and took passage for
herself and children in the same steamer.
He was annoyed, and remarked upon the
wetness of the sea; but she risked it, and
went on to I O U land, where she picked up
his tracks from place to place, just as in Vic-
toria, only more so. Ultimately, her legs
gave out, and she got a maintenance order
for 17s. 6d. a week, which he ignored. Then
she got a warrant, and he disappeared; and
this time she let him go. She got her decree,
and probably deserved it. #
“W.C.M.” in his anger:—
I want to protest against the habit of bring ng
food and drink into railway carriages. So soon as
the train gets a move on, out comes food ot some
kind. Babies get biscuits and cakes. The flapper
in the corner chews chocolates and a Charles Garvice
novel; and the middle-aged females drink bottled
tea and consume seed cake and their friends;/ reputa-
tions. They all make noises with their mouths. In
the smoking carriages the usual flask of bad whisky
circulates, often with sandwiches. The combined
flavor of chain-lightning, smoke and sultry stones
makes the air thick enough to cut. A man got in
at Junee with beer, biscuits and corned beef, and
from there to Sydney he rang the changes on beer,
beef and biscuits, biscuits beef and beer, and tpe
champing of his jaws as he consumed beef, beer
and biscuits is with me every time I enter a train.
Next time I go a journey I’ll travel on a stock train.
The Office Tirate writes :
Things are getting over the odds. Not long ago,
it was alleged that Australia was building a fleet
to blow Britain’s navy out of business. Later, it
was declared that Prime Minister Fisher had an-
nounced his intention of hauling down the British
flag, and, presumably, unfurling the old Rattlesnake
banner of South Carolina, or some such emblem
Not long ago, too, a howl of execration hit the kennel
of the dog star, when it asseverated that Canada
was talking of leaving J. Bull for Uncle Sam. But
it remained for Scotland to break into open revolt
It is the truth, the fact and the whole blighted
verity that the following appeared m last month s
issue of the Fiery Cross, issued in Edinburgh.
(The Cross is published with the object of promoting
Caledonian Home Rule, and restoring tne Stuart
family to the throne) :
The Clans are out, the Cross of Fire
O’er crag and glen has past;
O’er Highland cliff and Lowland mire
The Call is speeding fast.
“Our Prince has come: returned once more
His father’s throne to save.
Soon, soon, the cursed German gore
Our claymore’s edge shall lave . ,
Now, What does Bruce Smith and the Wimmin s
Patriotic League propose to do about a paper whicn
describes the existing royal family as cursed German
gore” ? * * *
Victoria's police are at present being
harassed by a woman who didn’t know it
was loaded. Some 15 years ago, when she
was plump and pleasing, she married Fong
Sin or words to that ettect, a Klistian Chow
who wore Australian clothes and no pigtail.
Sin attended the Filly Buk-stieet missions,
and otherwise wore the yellow flower ot a
blameless life; also, he prospered exceed-
ingly, so that he presently ran a cabinet-
making factory of bis own. Fast year he
decided to indulge in a holiday trip to China,
so he hypothecated the factory, sold" up his
home, placed his wife in lodgings and de-
parted. Of course, he sent his wife no re-
mittances, but she presently got a letter from
him, telling her that he had decided to stay
in Hong Kong, or some other unpleasant
place, and so would not have the joy of see-
ing her again. But he wished her the best
of luck, and a life strewn with pleasures.
Furthermore, he assured her he. would daily
pray, and he desired her to do likewise, that
they should meet in Heaven and talk things
over. The lady who didn’t know it was
loaded realises, however, that she will prob-
ably be very hungry before that time ar-
rives ; also, her last summer’s hat is dead
out of fashion, and her best boots refuse to
be a support to her any longer, bo she calls
upon O’Callaghan to go to China immedi-
ately and rescue her husband; and, the more
O’Callaghan tells her that he cant, the
more the lady tells him that he must.

The luck of the drunk —and the baby. A
Portarlington (Vic.) auntie took a 16-
months old nephew out in the perambulator,
and, of course, trundled the cart to the not-
far-off cliffs, which thereabouts are between
50 and 60 feet high. Dropping her handker-
chief, she left the perambulator and ran
back. The perambulator being on a slope, of
course took it into its head to make for the
edge and went right over. It descended
straight, bumped, and out fell baby. No
bones were broken, or other injury done. Ex-
actly the same thing will never happen to
that baby and auntie again.

That' the cigarette habit is taking an alarming
form was proved on Saturday night, when a young
woman of about 25 years of age was found wan-
dering about Centennial Park in her night attire. —
News item.
Drunk with the tender cigarette,
She took the starlit way,
Where all the grass with dew was wet
After the broiling day ;
Her face was rather white and set,
But all her pose was gay.
Her tender feet were swift and light,
She moved in circles wide,
Her clinging robe was soft and white
As raiment of a bride,
And all her tresses in the night
The lustrous stars had dyed.
She seemed a sweet and simple thing,
. Soft as a petalled flower,
Or some white dove that on the wing
Moves o’er a cypress bower,
Or like the downy clouds of Spring
That laugh before the shower.
Yet, though her feet with dew were wet,
No pleasant word she spake,
But some large sigh of long regret
Her bosom seemed to shake,
For having smoked a cigarette
She felt her heart must break.

“Ivangarooster,” on a matter of urgency.
“Quineecha” gave some interesting information re
Kangaroo Island, and its discovery by that intrepid
battler Flinders (pity he didn’t name it Flinders
Island), but he missed a lot of other points which
are of interest, particularly in regard to the strate-
gic position of the island from a defence point of
view. It is not very widely known that Nepean
Bay," protected by a sand-spit nine miles long, is a
safe and spacious harbor, which Nature evidently
specially prepared for a naval base. Admiral Day
Bosanquet, on the occasion of a recent visit, re-
gretted that Admiral Henderson had not seen it.
Also, it is a great pity the Minister of Defence has
not paid it a visit. Dowered with a glorious climate
and set in the most picturesque environment, it has
only come under notice during the last five years,
and has been consistently despised and neglected by
the S.A. Government.
The island supports 1364 people, 50,000 sheep,
1000 horses and 1000 cattle, and exports large
quantities of yacca gum, eucalyptus oil, skins, and
the finest malting barley known to commerce. A
sample of it recently beat the world at the Brewers
Exhibition. Hundreds of thousands of acres of
second-rate land are amenable to treatment with
superphosphate, and will be brought under, cultiva-
tion in the near future ; in addition to which there
are patches of river flats equal to anything in the
Commonwealth. But it is from a defence point of
view that the island is most valuable, and the sug-
gestion has been made that it would be possible for
the Commonwealth Government to acquire it from
S.A. Local legislators have no landed interests
there, so there is no land boom, and the Australian
people could very possibly drop on a real bargain,
the true value of which will only be recognised
when the Adelaide-Port Darwin line is put through.
Adequate defence must be found for the southerly ter-
minus. It appears that the Mikado’s Government re-
cognises this, as some 18 months ago the Jap cruiser
Aso anchored off American River, and her boats
were very busy for over 12 hours, ostensibly “fish-
ing” ! If the powers that be don’t give this matter
early and serious thought, they will do a mighty lot
of unpleasant thinking a bit later on.

After all, who does own this mottled

“The Pariah”: Is there any man who
leads a mote leisurely life than the small beef-
fattener? About his most strenuous brand of toil
is the buying of “stores” and the selling of “fats.”
Sometimes he has' to mend a fence —through inability
to get someone else to do the job. But that, is
about the limit of his toil. Know one champion
work-evader who has 320 acres of hill blocks, and 108
acres of river flat which grow luxurious strawberry
clover. He doesn’t milk, and he buys his mutton'
from a neighbor three miles away. He won’t kill any
beef, but if anyone nearby does, he’ll buy some. -He
will even sell a beast and buy back portion of it
dead. His labor consists of getting into his best
suit and a stiff collar for sale week. Every day he
meanders round the paddocks, and when he comes,
home tells Bill that such and such a post or wire
wants attention. Our camp bought some potatoes
from him, and I went to see why they , hadn’t ar-
rived, He led me on to the potato-corral, and dumbly
handed me the apparatus necessary to capture the
tuber in its native haunts. He called round at the
camp one Sunday at dinner-time. We did . not invite
him in. We were afraid he would ask us to cut up
his meat and feed him with a spoon.

Walter Lucas. Burns Philp’s Island man,
writes:—-
The Solomon Island pars which have recently
appeared in the “Abo.” page, show that the Copraliars
are quite as imaginative as the Australians, and I
have been most interested in their contradictions.
As “Beachcomber” was, years ago, a well-known
nom de plume of mine, I had, during my recent
Island trip, to disclaim any connection with the
inaccuracies lately appearing under that title. But
the limit is reached by “Sacul” (B. 9/11/’ll), whose
label is a very palpable effort to hang his state-
ments on my hatpeg. Whether it is that his own
name is one that is profoundly disrespected even
among the Islands, or is so obscure that any old
borrowed (nom de) plumes are preferable, is an
arguable question ; but I cannot afford to risk being
fathered with any fantastic anonymities which may
perhaps appeal to “Sacul” as likely to provide pay-
able copy. Hence this' disclaimer.
“Jimmie Pannikin,” in reply to “Locust” :
I did not say that the “civic sense” is yet de-
veloped in Australia as it has been in other coun-
tries ; but the new syllabus has done much —and
is going to do very much more —in cultivating the
“civic sense” in our schools and out of school. I
have inspected scores and scores and scores and
scores of town and bush schools in whose play-
grounds no litter is allowed ‘to accumulate, and at
which all scraps of lunch-papers, food, fruit-peel,
etc., are put every day into home-made garbage
tins, and burnt. Weeds and refuse from the dower
gardens, vegetable-beds, experimental plots, etc., are
put into compost pits, and made into manure. All
waste paper from the lavatories and tanks is
saved for the gardens and ornamental trees, shrubs
and vines. Many schools have progress committees,
vigilance committees, supervision committees,
decoration committees, etc., whose members
take a real and robust pride in carrying
out works that help the schools to be the
orderliest, brightest, cleanest places in the district.
The elections to these committees are often con-
tested very keenly. In numerous wise ways our
Australian schools are developing civic sense, self-
government, love of order and cleanliness, and an-
tipathy to waste. .
“9-3-11”: “J.J.C.” (B. 26/10/’ll) talks
through his ear when he says that mud is the best
antidote for the bite of a stinging tree. I also
advise him not to try the cold-water cure. If a
man is stung badly, he can feel it for two or three
months every time he dips the affected part in
water. And mud is no better than water. He also
says cattle eat the atrocity. Wrong again. Cattle
merely eat the smooth-leaf species, whose leaves only
bite when the tree is young. There is another
species, which grows in the scrubs around Nambour
and Yandina (Q.). Bushmen around those parts call
it the Gympie nettle. It has a large, broad leaf, and
lives two years. The only antidote is the cungevoi
lily, which is found along the river banks, and in
almost any place the Stinging fiend inhabits. Direc-
tions for use: Break a piece off the lily and rub
the affected part with it. I have never known the
natives try any other cure, if the lily was any-
where adjacent. The cungevoi is also an infallible
remedy for the sting of a “bull-rout,” the small
devil-fish which demoralises the brackish water in
most of the Northern rivers. If a “bull-rout” gets
at you, and there is no antidote handy, you can pre-
pare to go baresark with pain.
“Agrieola”: Am willing to have a side
wager with “Condamine” that a yellow box log will
burn longer than belah. Four years ago, in the
Tumbarumba (N.S.W.) district, a ring-barked yellow
box was blown down, and was subsequently fired.
Week after week it burned, despite heavy rains,
smouldering slowly along the trunk and each arm in
turn. Twenty-six weeks from the, day it was lighted,
the last inch of the last branch left its scorch mark
on my finger. Throughout the six months of its
consumption, the total amount of rainfall .was 18
inches, and, for, months after the last spark had
died out, a phantom tree of white ash sprawled
itself upon the landscape.
NIGHT IN THE BUSH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ten! And a tumbling, moth comes down, in a flurry
of creamy white.
With a palpitant body, all furred and brown, in
a blundering, crazy flight,
To find delight in the smellful flare that scatters its
light around
On the jam-tinned bark of the “table” there, in the
midst of a murk profound.
Ten! And the hurricane lantern smokes at the crest
of its sulky flame,
And Bill sits down with a straw to coax his pipe
to play the game',
And from a tattered scrap of print draws food for
his mental, needs,
While crowds of things that creep and bite crawl
round him as he reads.
Twelve! And the dim, untented fire flames up
from its cinders black,
With the fitfulness of a dulled desire, or the speed
of a hired bush-hack,
And Bill, he takes a drink of tea, and a snack of
damper grey,
And' sits, with his last pipe drawing free, and broods
on the coming day.
Twelve! At the edge of the gully-pool, where he
wallows in weedy slush,
The somnolent web-foot, careless, cool, in a heaven
of reed and rush,
Cries to the stars from his tangled deep, with a
solemn, occasional “plunk!”
And heavy with sleep the toiler Bill goes stumb-
ling to his bunk.
Three! And-a dingo moans and mows at the rising
moon, and prowls.
In the dark the plaintive blighter goes all up and
down and howls
Like a lost pub-soul on an Outback spree, far away
from the counter-lunch,
Draining the dregs of the jamboree in the clutch of
a fantod-bunch.
Three!. There’s a chill in the dewy air, and the
flitting hoot-owls call.
And, raising the wakeful bunk-bird’s hair, murmurs
of creep and crawl
Sound in the darkness; the drowsy creek-drums in
its smothering green,
And the • sleepless gums, they stir and speak quaint
pieces in between.
Six! And the lark, with a rousing shout,' begins
his morning hymn,
And Bill, awaking, lurches out, with a, stubbled
chin and grim.
And reaches a hand for his crumpled slacks —but
his drooping spirits rise
When he goes for firing, with his axe, to where the
deadwood lies,
For six it is! And the lovely dawn burns glorious
in the sky,
Arid Bill considers, with stretch and yawn, the rol-
licking birds go by—-
He: sees the gorgeous East, ablaze, and the green of
- grass and tree,
And slaps himself on the chest, and says: “This is
the world for me!”

Extract from The Insurance Observer, London
(4/11/1910). —“Combined Assurance: When the rates
quoted by The Colonial Mutual Life for endowment
assurance policies are examined and compared with,
those generally charged for ■ contracts of a similar
description, one’s belief in the future of this enter-
prising departure becomes stronger. A ‘combined’
policy, carrying the right ,to participate in profits,
can be had for about the same amount as has usually
to be paid for a contract which does not include
Accident and Sickness benefits.”*

“Hullo”: There are a lot of* questions
worrying me, for the answers to which 1 look in vain
in the “Abo.” columns. Here are a few of the things
that keep me awake during these long, hot days:—
(1) How far can a man spit? (For statistical
purposes, 1 am anxious to compare the distance spit
by a bullocky, and by the llama in the Zoo. The
latter animal made a record on me last Tuesday.)
(2) What is the greatest diameter of a swelled
head? (Actors excluded.)
(3) How many eggs a day can a hen lay when
doing her darndest?
(4) What is the slowest journey on record?
(Snails and congested stock trains barred.)
(5) What is the longest non-stop cursing record?
'"T intend to enter if this is not printed and paid
for.)
(») What is the greatest distance between
drinks ?
“Phil Harum”: Here is a record that
should make the mouths of the cow cockies on the
N.S.W. North Coast water. A farmer in the Peak
Hill district owns a half-bred Jersey which has had
three sets of twin calves in less than two years. In
September, 1909, twins were born, which she reared.
In the following spring she again had twins, but
one died ; and recently she again produced a strong
and healthy couple!:. Each lot were pairs—a gentle-
man cow and a heifer.
“Davalle” fires off his loaded mouth :• —-
Despite the whole crowd to the contrary, I agree
with "Sappnire Smith,” that tne Australian cocky
is fully justified in standing afar oft wlien motor or
steam tractors are on sale, and I’m speaking with
nve years’ experience of the brutes. At the present
time, 1 am driving a 20-li.p. Yankee motor engine
and I’ll wager I can do more work, and do it
cheaper, with 10 horses. To start with, it cost
a:500, whicn would pay for 12 good nags and har-
ness ; then it costs about Is. 6d. per ploughing acre
for petrol, besides the cost of labor, lubricating oil,
etc. And when you have paid that, you can start to
meet repairs, which are'the greatest cost of all. My
experience of the Yankee machine is that it is
thrown together anyhow; certainly it is not made
to stand the stump-jumping and stone-bumping which
the lay of this country demands. Let me drag
“Vagabond” in here, and tell him that the tractor
will not do any work that a horse can do; also,
it does have to be fed, watered and groomed. It
w T astes an hour every morning while it is being fed
with petrol, oiled and cleaned. As for water, it
uses 100 gals, a day in winter, and in summer the
water has to be changed every hour. Even then, the
cylinder touches 200 deg. i’. “Vagabond” further
said that the tractor does not need a staff of grooms.
Let me inform him that, whereas cocky’s groom
staff generally runs to one per 20 horses, and his
pay about £1 a week, the same cocky, with a
tractor, would require an experienced driver and a
blacksmith. Why a blacksmith ? Because there is
always some part of the engine or plough to mend, or
be fitted with spare parts (for which parts the
cocky pays through the nose). And what’s the use
of talking about doing all-night runs, even if the
machine would stand the continued strain, without
two or three experienced drivers? I’d like to say,
too, that when the machine is working reapers, it is
much slower than horses, and is not so economic in
getting the crop. “Vagabond” can also have my
share of the tractor for hauling wheat, since it won’t
do more than two miles an hour with 10 tons up on
a hard, level road. I have had a tractor stuck in
sand near Rainbow (Vic.) for three days, and here
(Bute, S.A.) in mud for a fortnight. You can’t
tell me anything about these traction devils. I
have driven American, British and Australian speci-
mens in four States of the Commonwealth, and I’ve
learned their steam and motor habits in most
classes of work on the land. At the present time, I
am working a 13-furrow plough, which is the biggest
in S.A. The next biggest is a 12-furrow imple-
ment at Cook’s Plains, where it is ripping up a few
acres of the alleged Ninety Mile Desert. But, take
good, sound advice, and leave the tractor on the
agent’s hands.

“Tommie J.P.”: Re “B. de 8.,” “Mallara-
poonie” and the matter of adopting aboriginal place-
names. The nom-de-nigger is sometimes hot enough
to burn the paper it is written on, and some sand
and saltbush sages assert that bush fires are often
caused that way. I knew a mulga maiden, a pretty,
well-educated, Irish-Australian, whose front name
(I can’t conscientiously call it her Christian name)
was, and is, a label of bastardy in aboriginal lingo.
She was the fifth child born in happy, honorable
wedlock. Her parents decided to give her an un-
common name. They did. Another fair gidyea-
girl had a front monniker that was an unchaste
invitation; but, when she learned the true meaning
of that mulga monniker, she dropped it for good.
Our aboriginal place-names, actual and proposed,
should be severely edited by a committee of eminent
philological authorities with no misdirected sense
of humor about them.

“Pick”: If “Barringtun” (B. -9/11/’ll)
wants to find the real antidote for the poison of
the stinging-tree, he’d better look in the sap of that
vegetable hornets’ nest. A strip of inner bark,
rubbed upon the burning spot, relieves the pain of
the sting instantly, and gives the recording angel a
chance to find his matches and light up.
“Bubbles”: Edward S. Sorenson (B.
2/11/’ll) writes on tent and camp, and dotes on
them. There are hundreds of men knocking about,
he says, who would not ex-
change their humble and di-
minutive bit of calico for a
tuck-pointed villa or a man-
sion. Just so. But then,
again, there are hundreds
who would. And there are
hundreds more who would,
but, knowing there is no
hope, “kid” themselves they
wouldn’t. Give them a
chance, though, and see what
would happen. We hear a
lot about the Call of the
Wild, and the free and
glorious bush life. Well, it
is there for those , who like
it. Why don’t people quit
their tuck-pointed villas and
mansions and embrace it?
For my own part I have had
just about 40 years of it, and
I love it so little that I’ll
swap —Edward S. can have
my tent and the snakes and
the mosquitoes, and the various breeds of ants;
also the blackfellow, and the dog with the tonsilitis
and the hairless dog, and the dog with the night-
mare. He can also have my brittle lizard, and I’ll
throw in my tent dreams of being a millionaire.
He’ll find them unsatisfying; but that will be his
funeral, not mine.
“Mr. Ocky” : For a place that is over-run
with lizards and scorpions, it would be hard to beat
the You Yangs, the three-peaked hills near Little
River (Vic.). There is scarcely a spot on the slopes
of the hills that is not alive with the creatures. The
lizards, which outnumber the scorpions by about
three to. one, are' mostly big, angry-looking things,
and have often been taken for alligators by the un-
initiated. It is almost impossible to shoot a single
lizard ; five or six generally come within the line of
fire, and pass from life to death in company. (Shock
seems to kill them as effectively as the bullet.)
They are on every, tree, rock and post, and have long
since realised that it is useless ■ for them to be shy
of the stranger, as the good hiding places are already
full.
“Nunawading”: A window in Bourke-
street (Melbourne) shows the skin of a tiger snake,
14ft. 2in. long, shot by E. Fitzgerald, of North Mel-
bourne. It is claimed to be the biggest “tiger” ever
seen. I never thought this snake grew to anything
like the length. However, you can measure for
yourself.
* * * *
“Agricola”: The “knotty pine” to which
“F. De Mutt” alludes (B. 9/11/’ll) is the “Murray
pine” of the Riverina, and also the “cypress pine”
of the Government specifications. As far as my ex-
perience goes, it is the best white-ant-resistant timber
going, but it is quite incorrect to say that the pest-
iferous varmints never attack it. I have found Mur-
ray pine logs with any quantity of ants on fixed de-
posit therein, and if they will devour the logs they
will inevitably gnaw the sawn timber. In my
opinion the ants will not sample the timber until
the resin or turpentine, to which they object, has de-
parted from it. There are few aged buildings of
Murray pine in this district (Riverina), but car-
penters have told me of two Murray. pine construc-
tions where the white ant had become thoroughly
domesticated, and was boiling the billy. The wood,
however, is so rarely attacked that, in this part of
the country, it has practically displaced all other
timbers in Government contracts. Partly owing to
its ant-resisting qualities the price of Murray pine
has gone up nearly 100 per cent, during the past
few years, and it is now the dearest timber on the
market.
“Nelson”: It has been said before, but
it is worth repeating, that the cow-cocky is not the
only sweater of children on the face of the Australian
earth. I know an old corn and pumpkin cocky on
the Mulgrave River, back o’ Cairns, who will take
some forgiving. In fact, I propose to nominate him
for the kid-sweating championship. One broiling
day in December I struck his holding. He was re-
clining in the sun, overseeing the work of four
small people, ranging in age from seven to 13 years.
Two of them, little girls of about seven and nine
years, were carrying water from an adjacent creek,
and pouring it into a large cask. The elder had
straps over her shoulders, to which were attached
two half kerosene tins ; the younger was fitted with
two large-sized billies. Close by, an under-sized
girl, of about 13, was fencing—yes, fencing! She
toiled sullenly at the hard ground, and couldn’t be
roused to further exertion, even by the bawled
orders and curses of the big proprietor, who ex-
plained to me that he “could get a man’s work out
of ’er.” Across the paddock a small boy was
ploughing with two old gnd poor horses, amongst
weeds that were almost 6ver his head. Rater, I
passed him, where he battled:; along bravely, urging
the animals at the top of his thin voice. I have
never forgotten that picture, and I never will, and if
the Commonwealth ever legalises lynching, the next
boat will find me hustling north with -a rope and a
few reliable friends.
“Flinderino”: I came across the scanty
remains of an ancient vessel, embedded in the sand
on the ocean beach at Yeppoon (Central Queensland).
Crayfish Dan was sitting on the doorstep of his
humpy near-by, so I stalked over and asked him
whether he knew anything of the history of the
dilapidated sticks. He knew- all about it. A gang
of French convicts had built the craft secretly, at
New Caledonia, many years ago, and in it had made
their escape from their island jug. After a tem-
pestuous voyage, lasting several weeks, they landed
on the Australian coast, but of the 17 who had
embarked on the craft only nine remained. The
rest had, one by one, been eaten by their starving
comrades. A few days later I was again on the
beach, and found another old salt mending his nets
alongside the decaying ribs. I obliged him with a
pipeful, and he told me the true yarn. The remains
were those of a schooner that came up from Sydney
in the ’so’s, with a search party, which was to go
inland and look for' Leichhardt. The schooner was
driven ashore at Yeppoon, and the expedition was
attacked by the blacks and speared to death. The
blood-thirsty aborigines held a cannibalistic feast
and corroboree the next evening. 1 mentioned
the matter at the hotel that night, and bought the
correct narrative on the instalment plan, paid in beer.
The wreckage belonged to a Spanish galleon that
was cruising around Australia before Captain Cook’s
time. My own subsequent investigations convince
me that the historical bundle of sticks was origin-
ally Boadicea’s yacht, and took part in the attack
on the Spanish Armada, and was afterwards sold as
a coal hulk at Botany Bay, but, unfortunately col-
lided with the Flying Dutchman off the Queensland
coast, where the crew, being prohibited immigrants,
were massacred by the Customs.
“What?”: I agree with “Leo Lear” (B.
26/10//11) that “Pick’s” 34-year-old posts are mere
youngsters when compared with some of the older
specimens in existence. I know of some ironbark posts
and rails within 14 miles of Singleton (N.S.W.)
which were split and erected as a boundary-fence in
or about the year 1850. Since then the timber has
been taken up, re-cut and re-erected three times, and
to-day is in a marvellous state of' preservation. Also,
some blue-gum flooring boards cut three years later
are still trodden by the descendants of the pioneer who
originally laid them. Perhaps it is worthy of mention
that white ants have honored pld age, and left these
timbers unmolested, even though woodwork in the
immediate vicinity has been totally destroyed.
«
From London Times (15/9/T1), being an
addition by Robert Young, editor of the
Japan Chronicle, to the annals of a race
which believed in the talk of Peace So-
cieties, and spurned the idea of naval or
other defence: —
Mr. Yang Ki-tak, an educated Korean, who form-
erly acted as native editor of a British newspaper
published in Korea, was arrested on a charge of fraud
in connection with the National Debt Redemption
Fund—a fund raised by Koreans with the object of
repaying to Japan the loans made to Korea, in the
naive belief that when this was done the Japanese
would retire from the country. Mr. Yang was
thrown into prison, and bail was refused. When the
trial took place the case against him broke down
entirely, and he was released. . . . He was imme-
diately re-arrested and charged with conspiring against
the life of the Governor-General. Not a particle of
evidence appears to have been discovered or pro-
duced to justify the charge, and it was abandoned.
The charge was then altered to an offence against the
Peace Preservation Regulations; the specific offence
charged was that Mr. Yang organised a plan to send
Koreans to West Ohientao, the territory on the
borders of Korea belonging to China, about which a
long dispute as to proprietorship was recently
settled in China’s favor. . .The Procurator advised the
Court to sentence Mr. Yang to penal servitude for
two years, and the Japanese Court gave judgment
accordingly. This political prisoner will, therefore,
have to serve a term of two years’ hard labor in a
Korean prison; and the conditions and crowded
state of these prisons may be judged from the fact
that the latest official report issued admits that every
five prisoners had to be content with one- tsubo of
space—in other words, in a climate where the tem-
perature ranges well into the 90’s in the summer,
five men are packed in a space of Oft. square, where
they eat, live, and sleep.
Australia’s personal interest in the above
lies in the fact that the fate of Yang Ki-
tak, of Korea, may be the fate of John
Brown of Victoria, or Bill Smith of N.S.
Wales, if the Great Trouble comes before
the Commonwealth boy army has had time
to grow up, or its infant fleet a chance to
develop into something worth while.
Though Fat doesn’t now dare to openly
disapprove of Wages Boards, he still hates
them as much as ever —and turns them to
unfair advantage whenever he can. Thus,
the Argus lately investigated the matter of
groceries, etc., found an all-round increase
varying from 5 to 20 per cent., and promptly
put it down to Wages Boards. The grocery
Wages Board only made its determinations
a few months ago, and the increases given
were so slight that they averaged no more
than 5 per cent, on the previous wages bill,
and less than 1 per cent, on the turnover.
The hours have not been lately reduced, so
the extra pay doesn’t account for a 5 or 10
per cent, rise in the prices of such articles as
sugar, flour, rice, sago, tapioca, barley, bis-
cuits, etc. One cause of the increase—which the
Argus carefully disremembers —is the land-
lord's habit of raising the rent on the slight-
est provocation, or on no provocation at all.
Other circumstances worth noting are (1)
that prices have been going up for years;
(2) that even in Freetrade Britain the rise
in the price of necessaries has been so great
that strikes and riots have lately ensued.
Surely even the Argus doesn’t imagine that
Victorian Wages Boards have shoved up
prices on the Old Kent Road, London, where
the late Harry Rickards knocked ’em long
ago.

Macmillans, in London, were to publish,
at the beginning of this month, a book by
Ralph Durand, based on Francisco Barreto’s
unsuccessful attempt to found a great Por-
tuguese empire in S’Africa. Durand is a
Sydney man who first got into print with
short stories in The Bulletin 12 or 15
years ago; but this is his first venture into
big work.
“Sardonyx”: The most remarkable figure
of the departing Manchu dynasty of China
was Keen Lung. Up till his time Man-
churian rule had been mild as milk. No
blood-spilling, no oppression, no foreign ag-
gressiveness. But K. Lung changed all that.
He crushed a Mohammedan revolt in Kam-
Shu hy simply exterminating all the Islam-
ites in the province. He made war in all
directions, and made it well. He grabbed
eastern Turkestan, carried the sword into
Burmah and Cochin-China, thrashed the
Ghurkas, subdued the Nepaulese, marched
almost to the gates of Calcutta, very nearly
came to blows with Britain, and got a leg-
in in Thibet. And in his spare time he wi;ote
poetry by the ton. The strenuous life killed
him at 83, after a reign of 59 years. He
passed out in the historic Irish year of

There are some men to whom the land
must seem an unnaturally solid and still
substance. One of them is Captain H. E.
Greenstreet, the commodore of the New Zea-
land Co.’s fleet, now on his eightieth round-
the-world voyage in the Remuera. He must
have looked every sort of sea in the face from
his bridge, and in his heart he probably
longs to live a moveless life in a suburban
street and watch the man opposite water the
garden with a hose at sunset. Grizzled sea
captains who have spent their lives picking
up lights and dropping pilots are always
suspected of secret yearnings like the above,
home attain the desired house and flagstaff;
the great majority seem to travel the green
streets and purple meadows of the sea till

A good man’s obituary:—
Harry Hedley, veteran cricket scribe for Melb. Age
and Leader, concluded his innings the other day. He
reported the England v. S. Aus. match in Adelaide
and was on duty for the first two days of England v.
ia, but on the Sunday he took to his bed, and on
the Monday, just as the two teams were sitting down
to lunch, Hedley was given out. He had been “Mid
Un tor about 30 years, and in the early ’Bo’s, when
Australia was mad on cricket, he went to England
with Murdoch’s team, that their lightest sneeze
might not pass unrecorded. Like all historic fol-
lowers of the world’s slowest-going game, Hedley
was a good sort and a simple soul, whose heart
stayed young.
Died in _ Sydney last week, after many
years of blindness, F. C. Brewer, who began
to tread the Inky Way of N. S. Wales as
far back as 1836. For three years he was
on the Monitor; then he went into the
feydney Herald office, and that was 10
years before the Fairfaxes came into the
business. At various times he was nearly
everything— except a decent penman; like
many printers who turn pressmen, he
churned out copy that suggested centipedes
m convulsions. With Sam Bennett, who
afterwards founded the Evening Blood-
stain, he was printing overseer; he was
theatrical critic, sub-editor, night editor,
London correspondent, and finally was put
in charge of the Echo —the Fairfax even-
ing sheet for which he and Heney, now of
the S. M. Herald, turned out editorial
notes that began at any old place and ended
at nowhere in particular, and in between
were allowed to wander where they liked so
long as they didn’t tread on the toes of any-
body that mattered.
Joseph Pepper, just dead in Adelaide, at
92, helped Colonel Light to lay out the city
wherein he died. Afterwards, he was with the
surveyor-explorer Darke, and only just
missed going on the expedition in which the
latter was blotted out by the blacks. Pepper
always stuck to South Aus., and helped in
the beginnings of many things.
It is vaguely remembered that there used
to be a man named Wood in the N.S.W. As-
sembly A reward will probably be offered
tor information as to what lias become of
him.
C. T. Madigan, sledger, surveyor and
assistant geologist to Mawson’s South Pole
party, is South Australia’s newest Rhodes
Scholar. Mawson met Madigan in London,
and promised to help him in getting his resi-
dence at Oxford postponed if he would join
the expedition. Milner, in charge of those
matters, agreed to hang things up for two
years, so Madigan will return to Oxford—
icebergs permitting—when the expedition
has sailed home again.
Westralian Minister “Tommy” Walker,
when in Sydney, anticipated an idea out of
which showmen are making a great deal of
money now. While in the N.S.W. Parlia-
ment, in the early ’9o’s, he wrote and pro-
duced a tragedy, “Marmondelle the Moor,”
m which he played the leading part. As a
dissolution was looming, and things were a
bit mixed, Walker conceived the idea of a
travelling theatre, tent, with a proper stage,
auditorium, dressing rooms, etc. He got to
the point of consulting the Fitzgeralds, of
circus fame, when the House dissolved, and
rather to bis surprise, he was re-elected for
the Northumberland district. Since then,
Sara Bernhardt, in America, and several
showmen out here, have played, and are
playing, drama in a tent, at the mercy of
the elements, while Tommy Walker has got
in out of the wet, as it were.
The obituary of “Billy” :
“Billy” T. Jones, formerly of Ballarat, but after-
wards of Britain, went the way of all sports last
week. Billy’s luck and shrewdness in mining and
turf speculation originated in Ballarat. He was a
boy-employee at the local aerated water factory of
.Rowlands and Lewis, but his earliest flutter in min-
ing made a rich man of him. Thereafter, noted for
getting on to the good things, he became “Lucky
Billy ’ —a kind-hearted little Jones, with a thick
tongue and a hard head. He was already an Angli-
cised Australian before he won the Melbourne Cup,
with Bravo, in 1889, and six years later he made
his home in England. He held a half-share in the
Flying Newhaven, his partner being William Cooper.
After that sensational animal had carried off the
V.R.C. Derby, Melbourne Cup, and other events, as
a three-year-old, in 1896, the owners shipped him to
Britain, and won some big stakes with him. New-
haven was the last of Billy’s horse-links with the
land he sprang from. He might have further tested
his luck by sending a few English horses out to Aus-
tralia to be trained, but, strange to say, he cut the
connection finally 15 years ago. Punters of old al-
ways expected a . fair “go” when they backed Billy
Jenes’s yellow with black diamonds, and, as far as
the owner’s intentions went, there was no cause for
complaint. It was not the fault of Billy (then in
England) that Bravo started stiff for the Caulfield
Cup of ’B9, trainer Tommy Jones having quietly
given the horse, a long gallop in the early morning,
so that he might miss the penalty of success at
Caulfield, and be all the more likely to win the Mel-
bourne Cup a fortnight later. It is an old racing
story, how jockey Mick O’Brien, reckoning Carbine
a sure thing for the Melbourne Cup, hoped to win
the Caulfield on Jones’s horse, and was baulked by
the wily trainer, with the result that Carbine, in
the Melbourne Cup, could only run second to the un-
penalised Bravo. Next year, when the champion nag
scored his great victory, poor Mick O’Brien, stricken
with consumption, was not able to take the mount.
Behold, this is the miserable story of
David Soong, native of China. Sixteen
years ago he forsook paganism, shaved his
head and became a Christian. A little
later, he became a Scotchbyterian parson.
When Moy Ling, another Chow reverend,
who was boss of the Wesleyan Mission in
Lillie Buk-stleet, Melbourne, passed out,
David left the Chowbyterian fold, became
a Methodist and was appointed to the
vacancy. The congregation, however, did
not welcome the new shepherd unanimously,
and half of it left the church. Four years
ago, David assisted to bring a countryman
to Australia under false representations. A
long time afterwards it was found out, and
an action was threatened. The State al-
leges that David gave Gabriel, a customs offi-
cer, £2O not to prosecute. Gabriel reported
this to the Department, and a writ against
David was issued, returnable on November
23. On Sunday, November 19, David went
to church in Lillie Buk-stleet earlier than
usual, and, when the Sunday-school pupils
straggled in later, they found him hanging
by the neck from a rafter. He had torn a
bit of window cord from the wall, climbed to
the roof, and thence dropped his bundle.
Two days later, the Age death column con-
tained a brief notice beginning: “SOONG.—
On the 19th November (suddenly).”
Senator Walker, who is a bank director
by trade, sees the good old days departing:—
Nowadays, there does not seem to be the kindly
feeling, the sense of honor, the esprit de corps among
employees that there used to be. In my time, 7
never knew a bank officer object to work after hours
if the necessity arose, and extra pay was never heard
of.
Exactly. Now, Senator Walker was born
on Leith Walk, Edinburgh, 70 years ago.
And he started banking in Sydney 51
years ago in the days when his bank was
content with much smaller dividends than
it wants now. The city was then a place of
about 80,000 people. The bank clerk could
get a decent cottage, for a few shillings a
week, so close to the bank that he could go
home for lunch; he hadn’t to pay 255. a
week for a very moderate sort of place five
or six miles away, and get there by hanging
on to the frenzied tail of Johnson’s tram-
car. Nor did he find great representatives
of Property like T. Walker raising his
rent twice in a year. In those old days
people like T. Walker were content "to
collect a mere fraction of the rent they
want now, but apparently T. Walker
thinks that no one should develop the
financial craving save men of his own class.
And, by the way, T. Walker was, it would
seem, a dissatisfied man. lacking in esprit
de corps, for he presently chucked the old
bank to take a better job in a new one.
Presumably, he wanted extra pay, or per-
haps he didn’t like the long hours. Then
something—perhaps desire for still more pay,
or a craving after an easier job, or lack of
whole-souled devotion to his new bank —sent
him to his present position.

Asa dividend of 21 p.c. is apt to make some of the
people out of whom it is made wonder whether they
are not paying too much for their whistle, this co.
changed the look of things in the easiest manner
possible: it formed a nominally new co., with a
capital of £200,000, one-half of which was paid out
of the old co.’s accumulated profits. The other
half represented the old co.’s paid capital. Thus,
without the shareholders putting their hands in their
pockets for a penny, the capital is doubled, and what
was a 21 p.c. dividend becomes one of 10* p.c.,
which doesn’t shriek so loud and attract so much
undesirable attention to itself. The original co.
was formed in 1878, with a capital of about £21,500,
and apparently all the rest of the £200,000 has
been provided out of profits. To the original share-
holders the present 12 p.c., therefore, gives an amaz-
ing return. There are few things that pay so well
as a fire insurance office, once it gets through its
teething. But the infantile mortality is dreadful.
All through its career this co. has had heaps of
confidence in itself, and fortune has favored the
brave. This shows how it has pushed:—

The loss rate of the last few years has been below
the average, partly because of tne good times, partly
perhaps uecause of the accident and other new
branexies of business that have been organised. Both
in fire and marine insurance good times undoubtedly
make a difference. With trade booming, people
take fewer risks with their business premises: the
insurance, they know, wouldn’t restore what they
would be out of pocket through loss of trade. (This
latter risk is being more or less covered nowadays by
so-called insurance of profits—a line which is well
worth consideration at the rates now charged.) Also,
fewer premises are unoccupied; and unoccupied
premises liave a bad habit of conflagrating. As to
marine business, the shipping trade is so good that
owners and captain are much more inclined to hang on
to a vessel in difficulties, rather than abandon it and
its contents to the underwriters. It is, no doubt,
much the same with accident insurance. In dull
times a cracked finger would mean a claim; under
present conditions a man has to have a broken
neck, or thereabouts, before an employer will sug-
gest that he’d better take a spell. From all of
which, and other things, it may be fairly assumed
that the present profits of this and other insur-
ance cos. are as abnormal as those of most other
trading concerns.
This co.’s ratio of capital and reserves to net
premiums is as 160 is to 100. The British offices’
average is 164 to 100. The Colonial Mutual is,
therefore, just about as strong as the average British
office; but, as the Australasian offices are usually very
much stronger, it is to be hoped that the directors
will now put the peg in and decline to raise the
div. until, by the accumulation of reserves, the ratio
is lifted to at least 200 to 1&0. The assets appear
to be a very excellent lot: those in liquid form (pub-
lic securities, fixed deposits and cash) run to
£266,067. This policy of keeping the bulk of the
funds liquid is to be highly commended. Naturally
it means a comparatively small interest return—
a shade under 4 p.c.—but especially in a business
liable to want large sums at short notice, there are
plenty of advantages to set against that.

But there’s something else. Hitherto the co. has
not shown any reinsurance fund' or reserve for un-
earned premiums; now one of £40,000 drops into
the balance-sheet. It is a most proper thing to
make some deduction from the year’s net income, on
account of the new policies written during the year. If
a risk begins on September 29, though a full year’s pre-
mium may be paid, it is clear that only l-365th
part, or thereabouts, of the money has been earned
during the year; consequently the net balance should
be transferred to a reinsurance or unearned-premiums
account. And, as the business increases, and the
amount of risk running into the next year grows,
that reserve should be added to. Apparently, this
co. had something resembling a reinsurance reserve
before: there was an item last year, “Sundry credi-
tors, amounts owing for reinsurances and claims,
£40,391,” and it can be said pretty confidently
that a contingency fund of some kind was included
in this total. At the same time, to build the newly-
specified reserve up to £40,000, it is understood that
a large bite was taken out of the past year’s net
income—larger, no doubt, than would have been
taken out had the fund previously had a formal and
separate existence. The true profits for the year
may, therefore, be safely taken to have exceeded
the £33,959 shown above. Moreover, £4003 has been
written off “furniture and plant.” No doubt the
office doormats have had a lot of wear and tear
during the year, and general manager Felton, who
is a verv important part of the plant, has had a
long illness; all the same, doormats are still pretty
eneap, in spite of Socialistic legislation, and it is
hoped that the general manager will return to work
as good as new. Hence, the £4003 written off looks
exceedingly liberal.
The co.’s business has grown very rapidly under
good, vigorous Australian management. This illus-
trates the progress and some other things:—

kike most Australian cos., this one had a very favor-
able loss rate in the past year. The growth of busi-
ness has been so extraordinarily rapid that, though
the amount paid in dividends has been small,
the funds (reserves and capital) have not been able
to keep pace with the r'sks. At present the ratio of
premiums to total funds is as 137 to 100, and that
is on the weak side. On the other hand, the risks
appear to be well distributed, and the assets are
as liquid as could wish for: public securities
total £ 00,673, and cash and deposits £149,503.
So clean’ is the balance-sheet that office furniture
has been written down to nil. Moreover, though the
securities are so gilt-edged, the interest is more than
sufficient to pay. the dividend ; so the entire under-
writing profit is available for reserves—in other
words, to further guarantee the policy-holders that
the claim-money will be there when it is wanted even
should some hitherto unheard-of disaster strike this
and other insurance offices of Australia.

This co. was formed in 1878 with the very modest
paid capital of £10,000; the other £102,345 of
present capital and reserves has been provided out of
profits Every few years there has been a distribu-
tion ; last year Is. per share was paid up in that
way on the 150,000 £1 shares, making them 7s.
paid ; this year something bigger is done, 25,000
new shares being issued paid to 75., equal to a bonus
of Is. 2d. on the old shares, or nearly 17 p.c. This
is, of course, in addition to the dividend. Fortu-
nately, this bonus money is not taken out of the
business; the only difference is that, being trans-
ferred to capital, it would thereafter, in ordinary
cases, carry dividend. The Mercantile Mutual’s divi-
dend is, however, calculated in an unusual manner,
though in a manner which has something to recom-
mend it; an amount equal to 20 p.c. of the fire
premiums is divided in equal parts between the
shareholders and the policy-holders. The growth of
the total dividend depends, therefore, not on the
increase of the capital, but on the growth of the fire
business. This produces one anomaly: the share-
holders don’t get any direct benefit at all from other
branches of the business, though of late years indus-
trial and burglary insurance has been added, and a
live stock department is being organised. This may
explain part of the big increase in the past year’s
additions to reserves, because the whole of the profits
from the new branches are apparently available for
that purpose.
Still, the chief factor in the year’s abnormal profit
was an exceptionally low loss rate. This shows: -

1911.. 86,808 21,957 40,090 25'2 „ 46‘2 ”
The high expense rate 'in 1908-9 was partly due to
the organisation of the accident, employers’ liability
and other branches, and the consequent necessary
alteration of the head office premises. Now, with
those branches organised, the side-lines can evidently
be worked at comparatively little expense. Whether
the co.’s old and phenomenally low fire-loss rate can
also be maintained is another matter; certainly last
year’s figures are more phenomenal even than usual.
Obviously it is the cream of the business that the
Mercantile Mutual takes; and while there isn’t cream
enough for everybody, some of the others contrive to
make still larger profits by attending to the much
greater bulk of milk. Actual payments to share-
holders have been so uniformly high that the co.’s
financial strength, compared with its risks, isn’t any-
thing extraordinary; paid capital and reserves are
only 129 p.c. of the year’s net premium income, the
latter being the handiest measure of the year’s risks.
The share-register is, however, exceptionally strong,
so the uncalled capital is no doubt good. Of the
funds, £71,451 is in city property and mortgages,
and £56,183 in “deposits and debentures”—an un-
satisfactory way of putting things, since “deben-
tures” may mean almost anything. The interest re-
turn last year was £4194, which was only about 34
p.c. on the average amount invested—a low return,
which probably means that a very small charge is
made against the co. for the use of the Pitt-street
office premises. The result of these small earnings
is that half the div. has to come from underwriting
profit, and that naturally cuts into the amount
available for reserves, wherefore the additions to the
latter haven’t, as a rule, been as solid as they might
have been. Which is another way of saying that the
shareholders seem hitherto to have been rather too
much concerned about getting big dividends to-day,
and rather too little about lying "the foundations for
very much bigger dividends to-morrow.

The authorised capital is £IOO,OOO, in 20,000 £5
shares, paid to £1 10s. Down to last year the
paid capital had been £15,000, in 10,000 shares.
Then another 5000 shares were issued at a premium
of £l, and the net amount of the premium has been
added to reserves. The last line of the table shows
£364 written off. This includes £IOO written off
leaseholds, as usual ; the amount might, no doubt,
just as well be deducted from profits at once, be-
cause sums put by to a leasehold sinking fund are
really a rent-charge. As to the other £264, a re-
serve appeared 12 months ago—“ Safe deposit sink-
ing fund” —but has now faded out. The profits of
the business have increased very remarkably during
the past few years. The big spring in S. Aus. pro-
perty values must have helped the co. This and all
other trustee cos. live mainly on two commissions
—one single charge on the capital value; the other,
an annual charge, on the annual value. There has
been a remarkable jump both in capital and annual
values in S. Aus., and both have brought grist to
i Also, the co.’s business has been
steadily growing. This shows the amount of trust

Probably the business has grown faster than even these
figures suggest, because latterly it must have been
much easier to realise properties and wind up cer-
tain estates. For the proper performance of its ob-
ligations under the trusts, the co. gives the security
of its capital and reserves—a bond into which a
private trustee is never expected to enter. These
guarantee funds are invested as follows: Public
securities £20,090 ; freeholds and leaseholds
£24,197 ; the balance in advances to estates and
sundries. Last year interest earnings amounted to
£1525 more than enough to pay the 8 p.c. div.,
leaving the whole of the profit from the trustee busi-
ness to go to the reserves for the further protection
of the co.’s clients.

Farmer and Co.’s business in Sydney goes back be-
yond the memory of the Oldest Inhabitant; and
when the present co. was formed to buy it in 1897
the purchase price was about £293,000. To raise
the necessary capital, 150,000 ordinary shares were
issued (the vendors took all this lot) ; and about
£66,660 of the balance of the purchase money was
paid in 6 p.c. cumulative pref. shares. The public
subscribed the rest, also on cum. pref. shares. The
present capital is £200,000 in pref. shares and
£156,230 in ordinaries. For many years there was
practically no dealing in either stock in Australia;
then the prefs. reached this market, and latterly the
ordinaries have got into circulation—the Australian
investor being naturally anxious, as usual, to show
how utterly he despises his favorite creed that the
country is going to the dogs, and that the only safe
thing for him to do with his money is to either bury
it in a jam tin or invest it in Kamschatka. So long
as the ordinaries were in the original hands, no at-
tempt was made to equalise dividends; what profit
was left after the prefs. were satisfied was mopped
up, whether it was much or little. Consequently,
when the outside public began to look in, there were
no reserves worth mentioning, after deducting the
£30,000 represented by goodwill on the assets side
of the sheet. A public quotation having been got
for both classes of shares, it became obviously de-
sirable to equalise divs., otherwise the shares would
be liable to become a handy counter for the mere
market gambler. That meant establishing reserves
under favorable conditions of trade; and excellent
progress has been made along that road during the
last four years.
And there has been much progress that isn’t
visible. Thus, great improvements (from the trader’s
point of view, anyhow) have been made at the co.’s
very fine central premises; yet, whereas freeholds
and plant stood in at £234,681 in 1908, the item is
now down to £226,529. From this it may be as-
sumed that the whole of the great cost of the altera-
tions has been borne by current profits—has been,
in effect, charged to working expenses, notwithstand-
ing that there must have been some disturbance of
trade while the alterations have been in progress.
On the other hand, Sydney can’t always expect to be
in a position to tell its wife to go to Farmer’s and
hang the expense ; yet if Sydney didn’t hang the ex-
pense with half its recent enthusiasm, it is plain
that Farmer’s would still be in a remarkably good
position. Last 12 months, for instance, after pay-
ing for the buildings and other extras, and provid-
ing for the pref. div., there was enough left to pay
17J p.c. on the ordinary capital. There is room
for a good shrinkage there without pinching ordin-
aries. And the more the reserves accumulate the
safer, is the prefs.’ investment, and the less likely
is the ordinaries’ bite to go below a reasonable thing
even in gloomy days. As to the safety of the prefs.’
investment, it has already been mentioned that. aDart
from stock (£169,275), the co.’s freeholds and
plant are valued at £226,529. On the freeholds
there is a plaster of £80,567. The co.’s only other
liabilities are trade debts ( £28,143) ; and,
against that, after providing for current divs., the
co. has £97,397 in liquid assets, mostly cash.

Now we probably know just as much about it as we
did before we started. These accounts are not pub-
lished for the purpose of giving information. All
that one is entitled to assume is that things have
been a good deal better this year than they were
last; and as last year they were good enough to
warrant a 71 p.c. div., this year they probably war-
ranted more. But the directors were evidently too
modest —or something—to pay more. The position
is certainly one of (say) delicacy. There is talk of
an Australian jam combine, ring, monopoly, or such
like. Of course, there isn’t any such thing. There
are quite a dozen separate concerns. All that has
happened is that this co. has secured all or most of
the shares in all but one or two of the biggest of
them. They are thus separate businesses, with a
single management. This co.’s accounts, conse-
quently, don’t show any godwill at all. But the
subsidiary cos., if they published their accounts,
might show something very different. Asa matter
of fact, when the co. was formed, Flack and Flack,
of Melbourne, valued the assets of the various con-
cerns at £308,672 ; and as £400,000 was paid for
the businesses, £91,328 was really paid for goodwill.
Besides that £400,000, another £IOO,OOO of capi-
tal went to purchase shares and interests in other
businesses; and probably some of that is goodwill,
too. Now, each of these concerns makes up its own
(unpublished) accounts, and declares its own divi-
dend ; and naturally all that this holding co. shows
is the aggregate of the dividends received. A, B
and C may be cos. whose stock is owned wholly by
this co. A may make £15,000, and decide to pay
away only £IO,OOO, using the other £SOOO to write
down something or other. B may make £20,000,
and decide to pay away £10,000; and so on. This
co. would show only £20,000; the fact that £15,000
additional profit was made, wouldn’t be even hinted
at in its accounts. Or, again, the various cos. might
conceivably be run in a wild and irresponsible man-
ner. The £IO,OOO div. paid each by A and B might
only be scraped together by running the plant to a
standstill, and providing nothing whatever for re-
newals. That would mean smash in the end; but
until the end came, the people who really owned
the properties, and who are entirely dependent on
them for their profits, would not necessarily know
a thing about the impending trouble. It is a ques-
tion of putting implicit trust in the management. It
knows what is happening; from the very nature of
the concern, even the general body of shareholders
in a holding company of this kind is not expected to
know. The investor bandages his eyes, buys a pup
and a piece of string, and thereafter goes around
with a label on his chest: “I am trusting to the dog.
it you find me in the gutter you’ll know what has
Happened. It doesn’t, however, follow by any
means that the dog will lead him into the gutter.
It may just as likely lead him up to the butcher
shop, where the juiciest steaks are.
All this will suggest that there is some risk some-
where. What is the danger? Why are things or-
ganised this way ? Evidently, in an attempt to
dodge any law that might be made for dealing with
trusts or Combines. Perhaps the directors over-
estimate the danger. There are people who regard
the Labor party as mad dogs, that will bite at any
trade combination on sight. The party isn’t likely
to do . an ything of the sort. If concerns in one line
of business combine to prevent waste, any sane party
will approve of it, and that sort of combine deserves
its profits. It is when the concerns combine to
squeeze unfair terms out of producers or consumers,
or both, that any sane party ought to disapprove
with its heaviest, sharpest axe.

After buying almost precisely the same quantity of
salts and senna for 18 months, Sydney seems to
have plunged lately. True, it may be possible to
take figures like this too seriously; for the remarkable
uniformity may be procured by the simple process of
, more or less the balance-sheet mixture
iFL i ii. Stocks on hand, plant and fixtures, etc.”
What that etc.” may mean was shown in February,
1910, when it was explained that “portion of the
co. s investments, previously included in the general
item, Patent Rights, etc.,’ has been applied to the
purchase of a property in George-street, near the
G. 1.0., for £50,600.” If the co. wants to hide
some profits, it can thus easily do it —-there are
plenty of stockings into which the money can be
dropped. In August, 1909, the co; owed £5365, and
besides anything it might have hidden amongst
Stocks on hand, plant gnd fixtures, patent rights,
etc.,” it had £16,226 of cash and book debts —a
surplus of £10,861. Excluding a £17,000 mort-
gage on the new freehold, the present surplus is
£24,531. Probably the £13,670, by which the
position has improved, represents the 18 months'
surplus of profits in excess of dividends. Still, this
paper isn’t going to be cock-sure about the matter.
This, however, is quite certain: the co. has been ex-
ceedingly prosperous. Seven years ago it owed
£18,716, and had £35,000 in freeholds. To-day it
owes £24,429, or only £5713 more, and has
£92,150 in freeholds. And it has also added nearly
£20,000 to its bank balances and book debts.
Whether this has been done out of profits wholly, or
whether it has been done partly by the sale of assets,
this paper doesn’t know. But it would be surprised
to learn that “stocks, plant, fixtures, etc.,” are
worth any less now than they were seven years ago.
“Patent rights” appear to have been either disposed
of or written off entirely.'

And £IOOO has been divided among employees as a
bonus during thp half-year. Things have been going
wonderfully well with the co. Originally, it was
wholly, or almost wholly, a carrying concern, doing
business chiefly in the back country. Then it de-
veloped a produce business, and latterly it has gone
in much more extensively for merchandise of the sort
the back country calls for. The three things work
in together; and exceptionally good seasons —com-
bined, no doubt, with very good management—have
done the rest. Business is carried on now in N. S.
Wales and Victoria; in the latter State the co.
trades as the McCulloch Carrying Cos., Ltd. Form-
erly it traded also in Queensland; but, probably
owing to difficulties of supervision, the co. three or
four years ago sold out of the Northern State. The
capital for many years stood at £70,000, in 28,000
shares of 50s. In 1910 the co. issued 4000 bonus
shares ; now the directors promise to “seriously con-
sider,” before the next half-yearly meeting, the issue
of another 4000—one in every present eight. This,
of course, would mean that the 10 p.c. div. would
call for £4500 per half-year ; and on recent records
that looks easy enough. Certainly, there hasn’t been
any notable growth of visible reserves during the last
few years; but £25,500 has been written off in 3A
years, and while some of that has come off plant and
properties, a great deal of it has been put to a con-
tingency account, which no doubt means an internal
reserve—a very proper provision to make, consider-
ing the good times the back country has had lately,
and the bad times it is quite likely to have soon.
As usual with people who do much business with the
back country, the co. has pretty heavy book-debts;
the total has increased lately, though very likely it
will be considerably reduced after the wool and
wheat harvests have gone to market, and Jumbuck
and his neighbor, the wheat cocky, have fingered
their cheques. This shows how various items have
moved in 10 years:—

also big profits under favorable conditions ; and there
is every indication that the co. realises the gloomy
possibilities, and makes provision accordingly.

This is the cheerful society which, not feeling very
well in 1892, thought it migh as well give its
figures a buck-up ; so it called in some valuators, had
its premises revalued, and promptly wrote up its
reserves by about £16,000, bringing them to about
£86,000. By these and other pleasant methods it
succeeded, even so late as 1892, in getting off a
new issue of shares at a premium of 2s. 6d. The
gum on the receipt stamps was hardly dry before the
bubble burst, and the gas has been escaping ever
since. As usual, the big end of the trouble was
that the society had borrowed a heap of money and
put it into more or less unsaleable things which
refused to earn any interest; so the shareholders’
capital has had to go in feeding the creditors. And
even then the creditors have had to make some
concessions; thus they were promised 5 p.c. interest
at first, but were subsequently (1894) practically
dragooned into taking 2) p.c. In 1898 that arrange-
ment was renewed ; and since then the funeral cortege
has cantered towards the cemetery like this: —
1898. 1910. 1911.

So in 13 years £219,734 of assets (book value)
have paid off £173,617 of debt. There still remain
debts amounting to £165,588, and, on the record of
the past 13 years, those will consume £209,000 of
assets (book value), leaving (say) £150,900 for the
shareholders; and if that sediment is worth as
much in the £ as the assets already sold, it will be
worth about £125,000. Or, if it is thought that
more recent results should be taken as a basis of
calculation, here they are: In the past two years
£38,638 of assets have paid off £27,948 of debt;
and at that rate the £359,902 of assets on hand
should be worth £260,000, or enough to pay off
the debt and leave £95,000 for shareholders. The
recent record is therefore less satisfactory than the
more remote. But when the shareholders will get
that £125,000, or £95,000, or so —if they ever get
it —this paper doesn’t know. If it has taken 13 years
to pay off £173,617, it may take almost as long
to pay off the other £165,588; and then share-
holders may begin to get some liquidation dividends.
The present nominal capital is £231,490. On a
business-like revaluation of assets, that amount
would probably be reduced by at least three-fourths.
Great Cobar published a quarterly report
in London at the end of October, and now we know
why shares slumped so badly. For three months, to
the end of September, the “estimated value of metals
produced, subject to costs of refining and realisa-
tion,” was £153,194. Costs (including £6OOB for
development, and £7186 for purchased ore) were
£117,120. That left £36,074 to cover refining and
realisation, management exes., and debenture interest.
The output was 1880 tons blister copper. Refining
and realisation would cost £6 per ton = £11,280.
Add £3OOO for management exes, and £11,250 for
debenture interest; total, £25,530. That would
leave £10,544 to cover depreciation and provide
dividends on £925,000 of capital. If the whole of
that profit were available for shareholders, it would
be a very small mouthful- —-less than 5 p.c. p.a.—-
but, unfortunately, there is the redemption of deben-
tures to be provided for.

Prop, and Block 14 got the ore at the surface; the
others, north and south, finding the surface poor,
thought their luck was out. But just when Block 14
was getting out of the ore, the North and the South
were getting into it; and they have a long way to
go yet.
B. H. South, with its eye on its friend the North,
pays a 2s. div. and a 3s. bonus. That makes £90,000
for the half-year, or £905,000 altogether. Sydney
once practically owned the South, and, after the
manner of Sydney, where mining ventures are con-
cerned, let go just when it should have held on.
In metal mining there isn’t a city Australia with
such a fine capacity as Sydney for missing the right
’bus and catching the wrong one.
The high price of tin tempted some Syd-
ney people to make an appeal for funds to reopen the
old Ottery mine, in the New England district
(N.S.W.), and to probe the Wallaroo, Mac-
donald and other shows.- The lode was fol-
lowed down to 600 ft. in the Ottery, and, be-
tween 1883 and 1905, the 84,210 tons of
vein-stuff gave nearly 250.0 tons of oxide;
but values were poor in the bottom. The veins in
the other shows are narrow.. The appeal for _ funds
would probably have been more successful if the
promoters had been more modest; but, in any case,
the £IO,OOO which was to have been put to the
credit of the co. wouldn’t have done the work neces-
sary to really prove the properties.
Kyloe (N.S.W.), came in for a little more
attention last week, when copper looked up. Taking
the metal at £SO, the gross value of the ore raised
in a recent average week was £3 10s. per ton; 362
tons of 5.6 p.c., value 565., were milled; 87.9 p.c.
of this was extracted in concentrates —remarkably
good work. Put into £ s. and., the mill extraction
(flotation plant included) was worth 435. per ton.
The richest ore is shipped without milling. But
Kyloe is badly placed for cheap working, being miles
from rail; and though it turns out nearly 1000 tons
of copper a year, it makes hardly any progress at
present prices. It would be worth while calling
n a tip-top copper man to consult as to whether the
best policy is bein~ pursued.

The star feature of the Ida H. meeting,
held in London on October 16, was the chairmans
announcement that a monthly distribution of 24 p.c.,
equal to 30 p.c. per annum, was to be started right
away, and that a bonus would probably be paid at
the end of the current financial year. Unless the
mine fills out a good deal, this extravagance will
soon have to stop On present appearances there is
no justification for it. • # *
Announced that the Associated Northern
has decided to complete its option on the Gimlet
South Extended at Ora Banda (W.A.). General
manager Roberts estimates the value of the low-
grade oxidised ore in sight at £2 o° ,oo°, of which
£70,000 is reckoned clear profit. No opinion
proffered as to how the sulphides are
An outlay of £130,000 on equipment, development
and extraction has to be faced before it can be de
finitely settled whether even the oxidised ores carry
the profit it is now do. *
Blighted hopes have made the Havilah
Co.’s heart sick, and the Board in Melbourne is con-
sidering the advisableness of treating the remaining
pay ore and accumulated slimes, and then giving the
mine best. A buyer would be welcomed, but the
sort that is content with a show with little or no-
thing visible left in it, isn’t easy to get hold of in
Westralia at present. # #
Hainault (W.A.) cleaned up 62,332 tons
during the financial year just ended, for a return
(after paying charges for realisation) of £83,b8/.
With one or two sundries there was a total revenue
of £83,763. Costs and administration exes, absorbed
£60,477, and after writing off mine development
(£13,229) and plant depreciation (£5450), a bal-
ance of £4607 remained to credit of profit and loss.
The carry-forward from the previous year increased
this credit to £12,722, but the payment of a 6d.
dividend has since lopped £3750 off this amount.
Estimated ore reserves remain as they were 12 months
ago, namely, 100,000 tons, assaying 28s. The man-
ager cheerfully observes that the great bulk of the
ore blocked out is situated on the eastern side _ of
the property, which locality, he remarks, promises
further satisfactory 'discoveries the future.

Greenfinch and other claimholders at Wes-
ton’s (W.A.) are to be given a chance. For months
past they have chirruped about what the district
could do if it had water; now the laying of a 6in.
pipe from the goldfields main, six miles distant, has
been sanctioned by the Minister, subject to the
Greenfinch Cos. taking all the water from this source
for two years. In all probability it will be dead
long before that period expires. #
Murchison Associated is having another
shot at its old Day Dawn cast-off in W.A., and is
sinking"a shaft on a reef which a tributor found for
it. The ore started off rich, but became patchy;
nevertheless, “great hopes are entertained” of some-
thing worth having in depth. The main workings
are also receiving attention, and a shoot, from which
some energetic persons extracted £15,00 worth of
gold some time ago, is to be further prospected.
* * * *
Yuanmi and Oroya-Black Range (W.A.)
banded themselves together on November 27. The
agreement arrived at is that the Yuanmi takes over
the assets and liabilities of the other co. as from Oc-
tober 1, 1911, with the exception of the 140,000
shares in the Yuanmi, which the Oroya-Black Range
received for its half-share in the Yuanmi property
when it was first floated. A further 60,000 shares
will be issued by the Yuanmi, so that Oroya-Black
Range shareholders will' receive one share m the
Yuanmi for every share now held. As in the case ot
the Lake View and Oroya Exploration combine
“Hail Columbia” Hoover, assisted by F. A. Govett
and G. P. Doolette, was the moving spirit behind the
scenes. # *
Three months ago it was suggested here
that Mount Morgan ought to call somebody in for
consultation. Naturally, perhaps, the management
didn’t rush the suggestion; but, as things were
getting no better, or only getting better very slowly,
Audley Smith, who had done fine work at Mount
Perry, was brought in, and he has been putting Ins
experience into the work for a month past The
trouble isn’t exclusively in the metallurgical depart-
ment; in fact, though the ore reserves are so great,
it is in regard to the supply of the right ore m the
right quantities that most trouble is occurring at
present —barring a recent accident at the blowers,
though that is only a passing trouble. Mount Mor-
gan took on too many big jobs at once, and, while
its plans looked all right, it doesn’t seem to have
had command of enough wide experience to provide
for all the adjustments that became necessary when
things didn’t pan out just as they were expected to
do. But things will work out all right in the end;
the co. has the ore, and it has the means to get
everything necessary to handle the ore.
The Chillagoe’s sampling of the New Ein-
asleigh has resulted in business: the co. will buy it
for 175,000 Chillagoe shares, paid to 95., and £35,000
in cash and second-mortgage debentures. Chillagoe
is at present in 1,000,000 shares, so a few thousands
more are neither here nor there. True, Chillagoe has
never paid its shareholders a dividend, and there
isn’t one yet visible on the horizon; but what can
Einasleigh do ? It is almost bound to send its ore to
Chillagoe for treatment, so it evidently comes to the
conclusion that, if anybody makes money out of the
mine, it will be the Chillagoe Cos. Taking that
view, it can’t be worse off as a part of the Chillagoe
Co., and it may some time or other be a good deal
better off. No doubt the £35,000 payable in cash
and debentures is to get rid of the co.’s own I 0 U’s,
which amount to about that total, and were becom-
ing rather troublesome.
... * * *
The Oaks Rush and Acorn (Q.) directors
very sensibly decide to amalgamate. The proposed
new concern —the Oaks Amalgamated—will have
250,000 shares of 4s. each, but 30,000 of them will
be reserved. Of the lot to be issued 100,000 will be
fully paid; 60,000 will go to the Oaks paid-ups
(share for share), and 40,000 to the Acorn paid-ups
(also share for share). The 130,000 contributings
will be issued, share for share, to the holders of the
contributings in the present eo., on payment of 4d.
They will then be paid to Is. 10d., and will be liable
for 2s. 2d. The £2000 cash to be got in will pay
for more mill plant and cyanide works. The reserve
shares will no doubt be used to buy contiguous blocks.
The amalgamation ought to mean much greater
economy; and it’s really a case for treatment on a
big scale with low costs, because, though there are
rich patches, the bulk of the stuff is low grade. It
is figured out that the Oaks Rush, which owns the
battery, etc., will get £5500 more than the Acorn;
but these figures needn’t be analysed too carefully.
It is enough that the scheme should pay both cos.
handsomely, and that the basis seems very fair.
* * * *
Charters Towers has been having another
brisk gamble, 28,840 shares being put through in a
week on the local Exchange ; but they are all low-priced
stocks. The scramble to get into things that have
been off the dividend list for years is due to a revival
in the Bonnie Dundee, Marshall’s Queen, Kelly’s Queen
Block and Brilliant Central. Marshall’s and Kelly’s,
after a very long spell, are paving sixpenny divi-
dends, and, although the ore reserves are limited,
there is local confidence that things will keep good
for a while. This will mean that the outsider will
come into the market. Then the Towers will sell
out, and once more make a tidy profit and be happy.
* * * *
Star and Thomson, Walhalla (Vic.),
stands for pluck. The co. worked out its shallow
shoot of stone, and got £20,000. Then it to
punch a tunnel into a hill 1000ft., to see how_ things
looked at depth. It got the reef where it was
expected, with gold showing. The strength of the
stone, presumably, lies north, and the pick is now
pointed that way. In these days of small things, Wal-
halla is feasting its eyes on the gold showing plainly
in laminations.
* * * *
The New Specimen Hill puffers at Dayles-
ford (Vic.) do their duty. True, a hunk of stone was
lifted out of the claim by John Bull and his prede-
cessors, and they ought not to have thrown up the
sponge when they did; but, at the very best, New
Specimen Hill was and is a low-grade show. Any
patches now got in, the bottom levels have to be
taken out, carefully, to keep up a 6dwt. average, for
no Daylesford mine ever fattened up yields with
stone got at depth. Further, if New Specimen Hill
did happen on to a bit of stone earlier than was
reckoned on, it is no reason why people should plunge
in the claims pegged out, north, south, east and
west.
North Frenchman, Daylesford (Vic.), ap-
pears to have struck the famous Heobuni Mineral
Spring. Hepburn, in particular, and the Daylesford
district in general, has been prospering, as a tourist
resort, on the strength mainly of the old spring that
yielded a flow of about 150 gallons an hour. The
Daylesford municipality reserved many acres of hill
and dale thereabouts, and spent £1000 on a pavilion,
where visitors drank the water, and dealers captured
it in cylinders. Baths were built, and a Melbourne
syndicate was formed to further exploit the cold
water cure. But, all the time, there was a haunting
dread that one or other of the adjacent mines would
cut into the mysterious watercourse, and burst up
the show. This, seemingly, has happened at last.
The spring finds no outlet at the pavilion, the baths
are closed till further orders, and Hepburn is mourn-
ing its loss. At latest, the mine manager was con-
sulting with his directors, who appear to be masters
of the position. If their legitimate quest for gold
is to be interrupted, and the hole they have made
is to be refilled for the purpose of forcing a small
water stream back to its original line of procedure-
well, how about compensation? Meanwhile, there is
no certainty that the seat of damage has been truly
located, or can be properly repaired in any case.
Nothing is certain save (1) the old Hepburn Spring
has run dry at the place where it formerly ran wet
and gassy, and (2) North Frenchmen shares were
quoted last week at —buyers, twopence.
Bendigo has lost the doubtful honor of
Holding the world’s deepest gold mine. The Vic.
Consolidated went down 4600ft. ; but, according to
the American Mining and Engineering World, at
the St. John del Rey Co.’s Morro Velho mine, in
Brazil, a 17th level has been driven 4926ft. below
the collar of the main shaft. As to industrial metal
mines, the Tamarack’s No. 5 shaft (owned by the
Calumet and Hecla Copper Co.) is a few inches
over 5280ft. deep; that is to say, a shade over a
mile. The same co. owns the deepest inclined shaft;
it crawls down the conglomeratejfor 8100ft.
The “passing” of a div. this quarter by
the Mount Lyell Co. is the first time such an acci-
dent has happened since 1897. At the shareholders’
meeting in Melbourne, an attempt was made to
draw chairman Bowes Kelly on the subject of the
superphosphate works, into which the co. has put a
quarter of a million. Were they not paying, and was
that one reason for passing the dividend? The
chair answered that the works were paying, but not
a drop more information would he yield.
Scamander Copper (Tas.) is out of debt;
so it prints a pretty, pink leaflet by Geologist Twelve-
trees, to bewilder and encourage those who hope
that the east coast of Tassy has for them a hidden
Mount Lyell. Some of Twelvetrees’s sentences are not
very cheerful. Thus: “The outcrop, like that of
many copper lodes, has a poor appearance.” This
hasn’t been sub-edited out of the reprint; and the hon-
esty that lets that go induces one to accept the later
statement that a shoot of ore, 400ft. long, is waiting
to be proved. The formation is pyrites in a quartz
gangue, with a little zinc and arsenic. Copper has
averaged about 10 p.c. in the ore bagged for ship-
ment, but, naturally, that won’t be the worst grade
available. Tassy thinks there is a show in the mine,
and so has put P. A. Byrne on the Board to prick the
Melbourne crowd into active call-making and cheap
mining.
Frank B. Powell’s report has set J. Bull
sniffing after P. P. Cook’s Northern Territory Mines
and Exploration preserves, on the McArthur River
(N.T.). Powell would not testify to “a greater than
Broken Hill,” as prospector King suggested, but he
certified to big outcrops, splashes and slugs of galena,
and some choice assays. This olla podrida, he thinks,
might be made into a delectable dish. When Frank
B. Powell thinks there is a sporting chance, London
is game. P. P. Cook, wily old fish, didn’t rise to
the first cast. So another slice of Fatman’s bait went
on to the hook. Then P.P.C. floated up, and took it
as nicely as his morning tea. What it all means is
a new co., with 5000 shares of £10 each; 2000 are
to go to the Melbourne crowd and to current option
holders; 1000, at £10 each, are to be paid for partly
in cash; an option over another 1000 is to be given
for nine months, at £15, and the last 1000 for 12
months, at £20. To a big London firm, the placing of a
neat little thing like this may mean coining money,
especially if the diamond drill hits a bit of ore. As
the “originals” were not disposed to fork out £4 a
share to test the leases, the Melbourne management
is to yield up gracefully the moment it has the. Bull
offer absolutely “firm.”
Tin: Don’t think either of them is an in-
vestment. No. 2 may 1 be a fair speculation.
“Will the undertaking pav?” The economical
handling and transport of ores, fluxes, coal, coke,
merchandise, etc., in or about mines, factories or
warehouses, very often solves the problem. W. and
J. Lempriere, of Melbourne, as agents for Bleichert
and Co., can give useful information on this subject.
The Bleichert firm has several aerial ropeways work-
irg in Australia, or in course of erection, and will
soon have at work, near Sydney, one of the largest
electric “Telpher” plants in existence. Special
electric and other cranes and mono-rail conveyors
can be procured from the same firm.*

The most modern, simple and effective Vacuum
Slimes Table is the “Wilficy.” It is continuous, and
consists of a revolving drum which is partly submerged
in a tank of slimes or material to be filtered. The
drum is covered with a filter cloth supported on
grooves on the drum, which are connected by means
of holes to the interior to allow the liquid to be
withdrawn. Through the trunnions at the ends of
the drum the vacuum pipe passes to the interior.
This pipe connects with the interior of the drum,
through which the liquid and air are withdrawn by
means of a vacuum pump. The filtered slime is re-
moved by a simple apparatus placed at or below the
level of the pulp in the tank. So that directly the
cake is removed, the surface of the filter cloth as it
revolves is immediately re-immersed in the pulp
ready to receive a fresh cake, thereby preventing the
sucking in of air, and consequent loss of vacuum
between the time the cake is removed and a fresh
one is forming. The residual liquid in the slime
cake is removed by distributing water over the sur-
face of the semi-dried cake. Owing to the fact that
the filter is circular in form, it will be seen that it
is continuous in operation, and has no complication
of valves to get out of order; furthermore, work is
being done continuously during the whole revolution
of the filter drum. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have the sole manu-
facturing rights of this filter.* [2

Extract from The Insurance Observer, London
(4/11/1910). —“Combined Assurance: When the rates
quoted by The Colonial Mutual Life for endowment
assurance policies are examined and compared with
those generally charged for contracts of a similar

The way to keep boarders is
to feed them well—as a matter
of fact, 1 find it hard sometimes
to get things as good as 1 would
like them to be. As regards tea,
however, I’m alright—l’ve been
using Robur for years, and 1
must say that I’ve never been
disappointed in a single packet—
sometimes I’ve found the tea a
little broken perhaps, but then,
it’s such real good tea to drink,
1 don’t mind that.
The No. 2 Grade is what l
use, and l never hear a grumble
about it. I’ve tried other kinds
of tea some were weak, and
had hardly any taste, and
others were bitter, and left a
horrible taste in your mouth;
but Robur, if you make it
properly, is always nice, and it
saves quite a lot of money in
a year.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, November 27, 1911.
My Dear Arini. —
The entertainment in which Miss Nellie
Stewart is collaborating with Hugh D. Me-
In tosh for the benefit of the Sydney Hos-
pital, premises some novel features. A vast
wooden floor (62,000 ft. of it) is to be put
down at the Stadium, free of charge, by a
charitable timber co. On it a cricket match
will be played by well-known theatrical
ladies during the afternoon of December 20
in the evening, up to 10 p.m. everyone who
is anyone at all in the world of smite and
concussion will spar with everybody else
who is any person whatsoever in the same
sphere. And at 11 p.m. a huge open-air
ball is to begin. The Stage intends to par-
ticipate more or less en masse, likewise a
section of the Church; and it is possible
that there may be a leavening of the Flesh,
the Devil and other well-known old identi-
y the Flesh is not there personally, it
mH be present in spirit. Government
House will be invited and offered an ornate
box and supper, and it is also proposed to
build a Melba box and request the heavenly
songstress to inhabit it during the revels.
Ihere will be a lot of other boxes for those
who care to do the Hospital the good turn
ot buying them, but the largest and most
scrumptious will be the above-mentioned
brace, lhis sort of ball, whereat, in thea-
trical parlance, the front and back of the
House and all the patrons thereof fore-
gather, while Society sits aloof and observes
their gyrations, is common enough in Eng-
land and on the continent of Europe, but
here it amounts to an innovation. Given
decent weather, the hours should be chased
on flying feet on the 20th by all that this
possesses of fair women and brave,
gilded men and youths and the pursuit
should last till daylight or thereabouts.
The Australian Women’s Handicrafts’ So-
ciety lias been successfully showing its
wares—stamped leather, lawns and lingerie
otc. in St. James’s Hall. The Handicraft
Y\ omen will have closed up shop in that
selection before this reaches you, and will
again burrow in their cellarette under St.
James s Chambers. Before putting up their
shutters in the Phillip-street haunt, they lured
Eady Chelmsford, the Cullen dame, and vari-
ous other dames with large and bulging
purses to meet together one afternoon last
week. Ihe musicai trio, Miss Emilie Lam-
bert, Miss Kitty Burton and Miss Edwards
(on the platform) smote the listening air
with voice, violin and piano as part of the
entertainment.
A solitary sentinel, the brand-new Aide de
Moleyns, did melancholy goose-step duty, on
a lone patch of floor, the while his lady in-
spected infants’ garments, gussets, herring
bones and other mysteries of the home-made
stitch. The Martyrdom of the Man de
Moleyns, occurred from 3 p.m. to about 4.30
p.m on the same day, but he seemed to feel
as if it had endured till two days after to-
morrow. He was suitably dressed, and wore
an expression of mild anguish. At 4 pm
after drifting up to the chair rail of Lady
C., and drifting back to his old patch of
floor, the victim became restive, and the
goose-step was more fortissimo. Torn from
his fellows, a stranger in a strange land, the
unhappy De Moleyns, stranded amongst
women s fixings, was last seen in the vicinity
ot a table covered with fine needlework.
Mrs. Pritchard Bassett, as president of the
V omen s Handicrafts Society, pours sweet
oil and other lubricants into its committee
wheels. Most of the work shown by this
Society last week, notably that of Miss
Mary Makinson, Miss Richards, Miss Crack-
nell and Miss Leist—touched high water-
other hand, some of it was
indifferent, and two-thirds of the exhibits
were priced too high. “Small profits and
quick returns” has been the foundation-
stone of every business success in this water-
front. The Handicrafts can’t live on well-
buttered paragraphs—they want to sell their
wares.
~.T i h e. s ?ciety of Artists’ show in Queen
Victoria Markets ripped itself open one day
week, without the assistance of any
official tin blade. A mass meeting of specta-
tors hummed round the Norman Lindsay,
Julian Ashton, J. J. Hilder and Hardy Wil-
son annuals A perfect lady, armed to the
eyeballs with a lorgnette, was like a fly on
tanglefoot when she sidled up to the mystic
beauty °f Hardy Wilson’s fantasy “Domain.”
fehe lifted one foot to escape, sank back on
the other, and stuck fast on the edge of the
Grecian buildings which architect Hardy
W. has erected on the painted shores of
Bradley s Head, and other leafy arbors that
tali into Sydney’s blue bay. A heated argu-
ment raged round the family history and
foreign politics of the dream-Domain. Then
the Lady of the Lorgnette put both feet into
the problem, and remarked : “It’s the Sydney
Domain, taken a very long time ago.”
Women painters make a good display at
the Society of Artists’ fine brush-ware show,
b lorence Rodway’s studies of children —little
Iheo W underlich, for instance, with his golden
thatch combed up; and Isobel McWhannel’s
agricultural pursuits—“ Seed Time,” as an
inducement to go on the land with a plough
may be quoted with acclamation. Also’
there is Eleanore Hunter’s fishing smack ; and
Ruby Winckler’s bump of originality pro-
trudes in the brilliant splash of color cata-
logued “Magi’s Shadow Show.” Add Mil-
dred Lovett’s portraits, and you have a really
good answer to the Twain small-boy ques-
tion, ‘What are girls good for, anyhow?”
For nine years or more, the Women’s
branch of the Empire League in these parts,
fondly believed that it helped the British
Lion to flick his eyelashes and lash his tail
in the face of foreign foes. The Men’s Em-
pire League was profoundly impressed with
its own assistance to the same weary but
titanic beast, and considerably less impressed
with the ladies’ efforts to shore up the king
or brutes. Strained remarks occasionally in-
dicated that the tail would eventually be
rent asunder by the combatants if they didn’t
amalgamate into one local blend. So the
“s aggregation—Mr. Bruce Smith, Mr.
Y\ llliam McMillan and other warriors
lowed the Women’s Empire combination, con-
sisting of Mrs. Hugh Dixson, Mrs. Rutter and
many other veterans. Now Peace spreads its
Wings over the crash of eggshell china, and
the British Lion has hurriedly snatched 40
winks.
Dr. Grace Boelke slogged for nine years as
hon. treasurer of the now defunct Women’s
Empire Brigade. She retired from these
labors about five months ago, when the rival
leaguers had agreed to smite Bull’s enemies
instead of each other. To express their
thanks for Dr. Boelkg’s service, 40 or 50, or
perchance 52, persons conspired together to
hand the lady a gold watch bracelet, last
week, in the house of Mrs. Greig-Smith, who
filled the invaders with light refreshments.'
Mrs. Rutter rendered first aid to the presen-
tation rally, and Mr. McMillan unloaded a
cargo of pleased observations.
The game which didn’t occur on Saturday
between the English cricketers and N.S.W.
drew a waiting crowd to the brink of the
Gricket Ground. Two false alarms glued
enthusiasts to the outside gates, and a break-
ing sky at 3 p.m. cheered long-distance trav-
ellers. The band remained dumb, and the
occasional policeman—hailed with unusual
joy as a sign that something was going to
happen—took an airing on the deserted
lawns, lhe members’ stand had an occa-
sional rush of two or three persons to its
seats, and a crowd of four was the most
riotous event of the day.
Members who bad gone early (to tne
cricket match that didn’t happen) to avoid
the tumult, the noise of the captains and the
shouting, supported themselves from the in-
terior of fat hamper baskets. Sometimes a
vast assemblage of quite six persons would
bolt down the stand steps and hang over the
fence that divides the pale-green members’
seats from the pale-green cricket ground. A
group of Englishmen, who were patting and
prodding the glad grass near the pitch, feel-
ing how wet it was, or how fast the fodder
was growing up, caused this outbreak. At
tour o clock, the rioters went home without
leaving their names and addresses with the
police.
An Australasian society which was nearly
washed away by the Coronation flood, is now
gh ™ nd faM y dp y on the upper reaches of
the lhames encampment. It clambered into
view hanging on to the coat-tails of John
McL-all and Australia’s Dr. Morrison—who
writes of Pekin pigtails to Bull’s Times. The
infant society cut its first teeth some time
this month.
The Christmas appeal is floating round
amongst the hearths and homes of the kindly
disposed. The hills and valleys of Hyde will
resound with three cheers if the large and
healthy cheque books of the prosperous turn
over a new leaf to help St. Brigid’s Orphan-
age in those parts. One hundred little or-
phans will also clap their hands —like the
little hills—and hop for joy, if Santa Claus
has some Christmas packets up his sleeve to
make a big bulge in their stockings. The
gentle Sisters of Mercy, who wipe away the
tear from the orphaned eye in St. Brigid’s
flower-trimmed home, ask for help—in money
or kind—-to give the youngsters a Christmas
treat. The orphan stocking is already hang-
ing on the cot rail with its mouth wide open.
Chief Medical Officer Ashburton Thomp-
son has whisked another finny illusion into
the salt sea waves. For uncounted years,
the brain-worker has been melted to tears
over Sydney’s dearth of fish. This marine
exhibit, as occasionally seen on the frying-
pan of the suburban kitchen, has always
been treated with respect as a builder up of
grey matter. Now Dr. Ashburton Thomp-
son smites the fish tradition with learned
deductions, and coldly remarks: “Fish is not
specially or directly suitable for those who
are engaged in brain work,” etc. Augustus
Superbus, who encouraged his wife to buy
costly schnapper—because it helped his gi-
gantic brain to unfold at his office desk-
may now have to slake his intellect on cold
mutton or any other handy breakfast Mrs.
Superbus can fill him up with, at half the
cost.
Judge Mitchell’s wife and daughter
quitted the Government Residency in the
Northern Territory by the St. Albans last
week, and will put in some part of the sum-
mer at the Grosvenor, in Sydney.
Mrs. Ivor Etherington (formerlv Winifred
Gullett, of this city) has added a small
daughter to the population of Colombo. So
that old Portuguese city of red soil and green
foliage is looking up.
Percy Hunter, the brisk and optimistic
Director of Immigration, has bounded ashore
from the gangway of the Zealandia, after
fleeing through U.S. and other oversea parts.
Mrs. M. Forrest, the Queensland writer of
verse and fiction, has been holiday-making in
this harbor-bound city for two or three
weeks, and flits back to Brisbane about the
time this meets your intelligent and pene-
trating glance.
James Ogilvie Grant, Maoriland’s native-
born Earl—Oamaru was his birthplace and
his tather is said to have once occupied a
plain and useful billet as lamplighter in that
town—is alleged to be on the gilded edge of
a large windfall under the will of the late
Caroline, Countess of Seafield. The Sea-
held coruscation didn’t carry with it great
bullion, and James Ogilvie Grant hung up
his coronet without much frill, at Oamaru
for choice. Now comes the news of a likely
rush of bullion to the Seafield head—said to
hi a i e , , llead that won ’t be easily knocked
°ir its bal a nce. Death, who meddles with
earls, dukes and other beerages, wiped out
the seventh Seafield, in 1881, and pushed his
°“ over * he , h ° nzon three years later. In
1088, a ninth Seafield Earl passed out, and
made room for the distant kinsman—the
public official of Oamaru. He speedily
tell asleep with his fathers, leaving James
his son, to wear the golden hat. Countess
Carohne is said to have left James half a
million of money.
Scenic artist John Gordon, whose fields,
flowers, waterfalls and shady trees grew on
the scene cloths of the J.C.W. theatres, and
.were nearly as large as life, and twice as
natural, has passed out. Death has been
officiously body-snatching some of the best
in this city, during the year which now drags
t le eleventh joint of its weary tail across the
calendar.
Even the cable, with all its condensation,
inds room for a streak of pathos now and
lor instance, London had a heroic
suffragette demonstration a few days ago.
, e sun was darkened with bricks and the
sky was blotted out with flying road metal,
fchops, restaurants, post-offices, Government
offices, private houses and Ministerial resi-
dences were attacked promiscuously. News-
paper establishments were wrecked. Rocks
rebounded like grasshoppers off politi-
cal clubs. 1 late-glass windows were two a
penny, and no elderly retired colonel could
put his bald cranium through the shattered
casement to see _what the trouble was about
without being hit on his dome of considera-
tion with a frying-pan or a pound of dirty
grease. There were 220 arrests (all ladies)
and among the “lumbered” was :■ —
Miss Billinghurst, a cripple, whose hands had been
lashed to a tricycle.
Poor Billinghurst—unmarried, not able to
throw anything, washed hither and thither in
the crowd, incompetent to even find her
handkerchief if she desired to sneeze; and
finally run in ! She cuts a pathetic figure in
that tale of riot.
Unless Sydney’s Town Hall is filled to its
last keyhole, echoes shriek under its organ-
pipes and wail amongst its ancient Aus-
trian chairs. Nellie Stewart—who got her
usual uproarious welcome—recited at Mrs.
Slapoftski’s farewell concert the other even-
ing, and the hall, being only comfortably
hiied in its body, and less so in its arms, legs
and galleries, the Echo family went on its
habitual evening burst. It buried the
’Actress and the Nun” (at St. Peter’s gate)
before their time, and it killed Banjo Pat-
erson s “Amateur Rider” in a frenzied shriek
from an unlicked Echo cub who hid himself
under the eastern gallery.
The singers champed their bits under simi-
lar outrages. Mrs. Slapoffski was at her
best, however, and the beautiful aria,
Ritorna Yincitor” (Aida), was too much
for the Echo riots. The “Rigoletto” quartet
—Mrs. Slap., Miss M. Barton, Mr. Harry
Neil, and Mr. A. Appleby—came too near
the recent operatic show of “Rigoletto,” and
Harry Neil’s tenor climbed the stairs afar off
from the McCormack silvery balloon ascent.
Une ot Mrs. Slap.’s encore numbers, “The
Last Rose of Summer,” dropped its fragrant
leaves in sweetest song. Most complimentary
concerts suffer from a rush of amateur chorus
singing. Mrs. Slap.’s concert escaped this
damage, and bore up nobly under too much
band as its solid frontispiece.
Soprano Lily Mackenzie Seton flitted over
to Fogland from this settlement, a few
months ago. She turned up in Bullopolis,
alive and well, at one of the Austral Club’s
weekly voice and cake spreads.
The youthful Dorothy Cumming, who
struck the age of 18, the other day, followed
this assault on Father Time by rising up
behind the footlights. The girl joined H. B.
Irving s disjointed walk co. before it strutted
out ot Sydney, rfhe passed beyond the Irv-
ing atmosphere—thick with Hamlet’s sighs
was melted down into the Melba opera
aviary—then joined the Ethel Irving “Dame
Nature co. Dorothy hopes to die soon, as
Beauty in the second act of Hilda Spong’s
foregathering “Every Woman.” For a young
person of 18, she has walked the earth to
some purpose.
On most fine afternoons in the week an
expectant crowd sprinkles the pavement out-
side Challis. House. Its objective is a
notable _ tourist car, which wears speckled
side-whiskers of oranges and their green
leaves, as an emblem of its fixed resolve to
travel through the groves where the mandarin
blooms. At least, it did wear this garniture
but it s been moulting its foliage till the
other day, only a stem remained. When the
orange crowd departs to rubber-tyre the
face of Nature, the pavement party props
itself against the Tourist Department’s plate
glass, and patiently gums its attention on to
the oil paint display inside. This serves as
a pick-me-up after the heated reflection of
tlic potted tourist, who furiously resents
being treated as an exhibit.
n Gnu* MUier Ward ' s songs lifted the
v iv r i f? l l dd TT n I Morris Pianoforte recital in the
X.M.L.A. Hall, on Saturday night, out of a
dull rut, where it threatened to stick like an
overloaded waggon.
The youthful Carl Morris, who is on the
wing to Europe in search of more technique
is a pupil of Miss Yvonne Leverrier (Mrs’
Lharvin). Carl shows acute symptoms of
careful training, and grips the keyboard with
considerable skill—notably in brilliant move-
ments. But he appears to lack “tempera-
ment —a curse the pianist must conceal
about his person. If Carl Budden Morris
shakes himself together, .and wakes up out
of his present placid slumber, he may do
things of consequence later on. The Chopin
Concerto (with two pianos) was the boy's
chief success on Saturday night. The grace-
ful Isabel Ilamsay, at the second piano, really
bred this concerto into life, by her delightful
performance. Consular bodies rested their
diplomatic feet on carpet squares at the
Morns farewell, and the flaxen hair of Mrs
Armand, with the black roof of Consul-Gen-
erai Armand, were entirely surrounded bv
other diplomatic locks.
on Th , e ha . nd out the news item that
i 0t the Maoris who went to London to
show at White City frolics during the crown-
ing uproar, are going to anchor in the Great
log. I lie disapproval” of Maoriland’s Pie
Commissioner Hall-Jones, whose advice
ought to have carried several tons weight
hasn't been able to combat the influence of
the wandering Rangiuia. This person is
not connected with the Maoris whom the
feydney syndicate backed. Rangiuia seems
to e nave tethered the seceding 20‘to the City
ot the Great Ram. Whether Maggie Papa-
kura is amongst those who will leap off the
Somerset when it ties up to the wharf at
this side, deponent knoweth not.
A dead whale is reported to have climbed
ashore on to the Salvation Army rocks near
Manly’s long wash. As I write, the animal
is one of those who, being dead, yet speak-
eth, and his remarks are greatly in excess of
the speed limit.
According to the gospel of the Tailor and
Cutter, Man is going to hit back at Woman,
who has snatched his clothes —ties, collars
waistcoats, etc.—for some years. He is
plunging in feminine buttons —delicate fan-
cies to trim his new silk “waists,” which run
to poplin in faint tones of salad green, blush
pink and mustard. His trouser tops have
long turned up to reveal his beautiful socks,
and his soulful eyes are liable to soon look
out at his dressy rival, Woman, from under
the shady balcony of a crinoline straw hat.
Hurried word comes from Isaak Walton,
junior. He’s been whipping the waters of
the Snowy and Thredbo, down on Monaro
and remarks: “Trout are so plentiful and
hungry that they eat grass on the banks, if
the fisherman doesn’t rush the fly down their
throats.”
Yours for all time,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, November 27, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The G.-G. Denman kiddies —Hon. Tommy
Denman, aged six, and Hon. Judy Denman,
aged 4\ —assisted by little Miss Fuller, the
daughter of the Vic. vice-regals, were the
centre-pieces in a proceeding at the Mel-
bourne Children’s Hospital, the other Mon-
day. The foundation stone of a surgical pav-
ilion had to be laid, with the usual ceremon-
ial foolishness, and these exalted youngsters
were engaged, as a trio, to do the deed that
is ordinarily done by a full-blown figure-
head. Thus, the hospital committee found
excuse to present three silver trowels, and
not one silver trowel to three holy guests,
and not one holy guest—which was a “per-
fectly beautiful novelty,” as a strenuous
member of the W.N.P. League remarked in
a tone of ecstasy. The momm’ers of the in-
fant performers led the applause, together
with Lady Barttelot (whose two young hope-
fuls tried hard to dissemble their envy of the
trowelled three), Lord Dick and other suite
mates. Even the weighty Frank Madden
felt the exceptional charm of the occasion,
and gave fanciful expression to his delight.
He addressed the stone layers as “dears,” and
told them that their workmanship suggested
deep experience in the art of making mud
pies. Whereat the kiddies laughed. The
Madden remarks having closed in a blaze of
facts and figures, another gentleman referred
to the “importance” of the part played by
the distinguished nippers, and Lady Denmaii
thanked the committee for placing such im-
portant work in. the hands of Tom and Judy
—not forgetting the little Bridget.
The recent general elections nearly ran
off the course, because someone had dropped
a bit of red tape. A clerical error in the
writ was discovered at the eleventh hour,
and it required a fresh signature by State
Governor Fuller to set it right. His Ex. was
at that time near Warrnambool, on the roof
of a horse. He was motored frantically
across country, hustled into a train and
shoved into Premier Weary’s arms, at Mel-
bourne, on the stroke of midnight, on the last
day possible for the declaration, or whatever
it was. The chief regret of the hustled Ful-
ler was that he had been forced to miss a
kangaroo drive on the Lindsay run, where
great mobs of the bounding animals feed and
hop. Lady Fuller drove through creeks and
over hills to the round-up, while the recalled
Governor rode like the wind towards the
waiting car.
One of the interesting relatives of the
G.-G. Denmans is that Richard Davey, who
writes about the Tower of London, Lady
Jane Grey, and other dead or moderately-
perished topics. By marriage, he is an uncle
of the G.-G., his wife being Eleanor Denman,
granddaughter of the man who defended
Queen Caroline. On his own side, he has
curious historical connections. His mother
was a daughter of Patrick Boyle, once secre-
tary to Elizabeth, the illustrious Duchess of
Devonshire. Ilis aunt, another Boyle,
wedded John Thelwall, the orator, reformer,
and friend of Lamb, who edited the Cham-
pion, composed the ingenious “Song Without
a Sibilant,” and was tried for high treason
in 1794. Davey mere, was a treasury of re-
collections on various celebrities of her
period. Her friends included Harrison Ains-
worth, Charles Dickens, G. P. R. James,
and other literary characters; and on one
occasion she danced witn the first Napoleon.
It is darkly hinted that she left some absorb-
ing gossip, which her son will one day put
into a volume of memoirs. He, by the way,
is now inhabiting the three-storeyed pile on
the Grand Canal, Venice, where Wagner
revised his “Parsifal,” and subsequently
died.
Lady Grey Egerton, once the absentee
wife of Baronet Clarke, is now best described
in England as a political pamphlet in a tailor-
made. She puts in her spoke at meetings of
the upper masses, and is regarded as an “in-
fluence.” Recently she addressed a large
crowd at Chester, England, on the topic of
Home Rule. The lady was against Home
Rule in all its branches and developments.
Pretty Louise Smith is to play the bride’s
part at St. Peter’s, Eastern Hill, at an
early date. The prospective bridegroom, Mr.
Dyer, of U.S.A., is both wealthy and bene-
volent. Moreover, he is an uncrowned mon-
arch —the “Linoleum King” of commerce.
Two bridesmaids will follow the dainty bride
to the altar ; but only two old friends of the
family are to be bidden to the wedding feast.
The engagement is the outcome of a board-
ship acquaintance, for twice in her travels
to Europe the clever Louise met the matured
widower as a co-passenger.
Theyre Weigall,' who died at Brighton last
week, was one of the oldest residents of the
district. He saw the place grow from a few
scattered homesteads, at whose back doors
King Billy and his relatives were frequent
callers, to its present .magnificence. He was
curator of the estates of souls who had
taken passage to Charon, and also ranked
as head of the numerous and brainy Weigall-
a’Beckett clan. As the landlord of many
small houses, he was an inflexible person,
whose glance struck cold to the heart of the
roof-hirer, who had rashly asked for a new
copper. (There is a brand of tenant who
makes it a rule to ask the landlord for some
repairs or improvements every time he calls ;
so the landlord, if he be a meek person, grad-
ually loses his nerve, and hates the job of
collecting the rent. Some of them feel it so
much that, rather than be subjected to the
ordeal, they never call at all, and die in pov-
erty with thousands of pounds owing to
them.) Chief Justice Higinbotham (whose
portrait, blue-eyed and benevolent, smiles
from the wall of the local library) and Theyre
Weigall were close friends and allies ; so it
goes without saying that the lately deceased
Brightonian was a man of good principles.
Of his five sons, three are doctors and one a
barrister.
Reggie Bright, he of the blue eyes and
the snow-white roof, sold his household gods
some time ago, and went to England to end
his days in the peace and quiet of his sister’s
roof-tree. Now he has returned suddenly,
looking for a climate that is fit for a fine old
gentleman to live in.
Mrs. Geox-ge Stevenson, widow of the late
George Stevenson of “The Lane,” who died
last week, was a mother in Israel as the
saying goes, inasmuch as she gave 17 children
to her country. She was a pretty woman and
greatly liked. The Stevensons originally
owned the John Simson mansion, at Toorak,
but later they faded out to Malvern.
Daughter Ernestine was the favorite com-
panion of the Cumming-Clarke-Grey-Egerton
lady.
De Cisneros and her following, on one of her
nights off, filled two boxes at Ethel Irving’s
show, “Dame Nature.” The large lady was
muffled in a purple twilight cloak, like the
Delilah wrappings wherein she kept tryst with
Samson of Israel. Little Axarine moved in
her shadow; while understudy Ranzenberg
climbed to the upper box, and there spread
her cherry-colored mantle to the four winds
of approbation.
Ethel Irving, as the model in “Dame Na-
ture,” spends half the first act with her back
to the audience. The is grey, and
shows a glimpse of bare neck. A rose-
studded turban is the summit of the toilette.
She shames her snobbish husband by her
Bohemian ways in society, but she is always
as dainty a little vulgarian as may be. Her
incidental, “Oh, Hell!” has a fresh young
charm, though it suggests that Lolette’s
middle age will be a tenable thing for the
man who shares it.
One Wayback dandy did “Romeo and
Juliet,” and spread himself proudly in the
foyer of the stalls at intervals. With a con-
ventional dress suit, he wore tan boots, a
flaring tie, and a wide panama hat.
At the Grand, the other day, Mrs. Jansen,,
in a red velvet dress, gathered together the
Melbourne Operatic Society to say good-bye
to Freddie Beard. Besides food and chatter,
there was singing and other music, includ-
ing the Cool Drink Sonata, played with bits
of ice on glasses. Freddie unbent, at last, to
reveal an unguessed talent for Chevalier’s
coster songs. Before Chevalier took to the
halls, Beard toured with him as accompan-
ist. Mrs. Jansen became imbued with the
same unconventional spirit, and sang a
piquant Spanish song. Arral sang the same
ditty in a cheeky mood one night, in the
Town Hall. Beard has been a most fare-
welled person. The Jansen party was fol-
lowed, on Wednesday night, by a drawing-
room concert given by his students, in the
Masonic Hall. The State Governoress was
to have been present, but Macedon is a far
cry from the Masonic, and she couldn’t
manage it. In the absence of Lady Fuller,
the leading figure was Dame Forrest, in a
dress with some droopy shoulder lace. On
Saturday, the Victorian Festival Choristers
stroked their Beard, and there still remained
the sighs of St. Pat’s choir for him to res-
pond to.
Manager Meyer, of Williamson Ltd., back
in Melbourne after a Westralian trip, is now
making preparations for the return of the
Asches. He complains that he has been in
Melbourne three years running, but missed
the Cup each time, his duties keeping him
just too long- on the road to see the gallop.
Meyer and Count de Cisneros were like as two
peas before the hot West tanned and thinned
the former’s plumpness.
Melba makes a plump and pleasing Juliet.
The dress in which she charms Romeo in
the first act is what the Philistines in the
other opera would call a “bobby dazzler.” It
is a silver sheath that clings and ripples and
shimmers. It gives you the impression that
Melba has to be poured into it from the top-
end where the lattice of diamonds is. There
is not the slightest suggestion of the trouble-
some hook about the masterpiece. A side-
cut near the knee is laced together with
cords, and the grey satin underthings might
be tights. No one can understand Juliet
falling in love with Romeo’s clothes. At
first, he js a white and purple blot with very
scarlet lips and an inadequate mask. How-
ever, in the balcony scene, he becomes an
angelic voice encased in purple velvet.
The Arts and Crafts people are making a
bid for the Christmas-present-buying crowd
with a general sale that stretches across the
calendar from November 28 to December 23.
They were surprised to find that a demand
had set in before the show opened. The
demanders were the people who wanted good
Australian presents for relatives and friends
in Europe, for which place the last Christ-
mas mail leaves in November. The Arts and
Crafts have taken the hint, and will profit
by it next year.
The Greens have invited proud parents
and friends to watch the pupils pirouette in
the Masonic Hall, on Saturday, December 9.
The annual ball has always been a severe
crush in the vast Town Hall. The compres-
sion will be stupendous in the smaller
Masonic.
Miss Ethel Webb invites ladies only (male
medicoes counting as females in this matter)
to a demonstration of true physical culture,
on Friday next. Lady Fuller and the Ad-
miral’s wife will sit in the seats of the
mighty. The lecture is to be highly concen-
trated, and just a few girl cult examples will
demonstrate in abbreviated bathing gowns.
Hence the necessity of giving the dear kind
doctors a monopoly of the treat.
There were alterations in the cast of last
Thursday’s performance of “Tosca.” McCor-
mack was replaced by Ciccolini, who lacks
the Mac warble, but wears, in its place, a sad,
sweet moustache. Edmund Burke appeared
as Scarpia instead of Scandiani. Burke’s
Scarpia was less wicked, and not so real as
Scandiani’s; but he sang splendidly in
Italian, and he showed more of the ’aughty
courtliness of the hardened potentate when
making advances to the Tosca, who sent
forth screams of melodious agony, in an
unduly ornate gown and a blaze of dia-
monds. Wayda, of course, was the lady.
The G.-G., with a large contingent of gentle-
men helps, occupied a box; and Melba,
gowned in black, sat, mostly with Dick
Nevill in attentive attendance, in the front
row of the circle. After the murder of
Scarpia, the G.-G. sent a Help round to say
that he would like to discuss the tragedy
with her, so she floated into the vice-regal
compartment, and remained there till closing
time.
Beatrice Lockhart (who used to be Bea-
trice Phillips, of Sydney) has composed two
songs, “Love’s Pleading” and “If,” the words
being supplied by Ivy Bendixen Ghugg. Both
ditties are very melodious.
Miss Asquith Baker held a successful ex-
hibition of paintings at her studio last week.
She did not make it a rule that hatpins had
to be surrendered at the door, although she
would have been justified, since her charming
brain child, “Sweet Sixteen,” had a quantity
of paint scratched off her cheeks, when she
was flaunting her beauty under the chaper-
onage of the N.S.W. women artists.
The sweet-faced Christine, who was warmly
applauded in Paris, and had her work
hung in the Salon, comes of an able-
minded stock. Her deceased father and the
present British Prime Minister shared a
grandfather between them.
The inter-State tepnis carnival, on the
Albert Ground, which finished on Saturday,
included the Denman lady and Private Secre-
tary Vernon as competitors. They played in
the Mixed Doubles ; but, after two perform-
ances, described as “attractive,” they were
beaten by two common mortals. Society
dutifully followed the G.-G. lead to the
courts, and fined itself an immense amount of
afternoon tea without the , option. Lady
Denman put in a busy week-end. On Satur-
day, she opened the Campbells’ successful
garden fete at Ottawa, played in the Doubles,
and then went on to the polo match at
Kooyong. Next morning she attended
church as usual.
Every year, the' Automobile Club gives a
country run and picnic to the children of the
hospitals and homes. Last Saturday, about
60 decorated cars and lorries whizzed round
the. beach road to Mordialloc, and emptied
their loads on a comfortable pleasure ground
fitted up with a whirling merry-go-round, a
Punch and Judy, and much food and drink —
not to mention strawberries pnd ice cream.
There were altogether 400 small, shouting
guests, each of whom spoke ip a lordly way
about “our car.” The youngsters played
with the expensive, grown-up oil toys, the
little girls proudly spreading their skirts on
the cushions of the tonneaus, while the little
boys fought one another for possession of
the sacred steering wheels and levers. Su-
perior “shovers,” who would pot tolerate
interference with their machines on ordinary
days, stood by and smiled benignantly while
the little people dulled the brasswork with
hot hands, and left dusty traces with their
boots. . Presents were distributed by the ton,
and Miss Rand presented each of the 400
with a new shilling. As the procession was
speeding towards home and bed, one child
remarked from the depths of luxurious
cushions that he preferred a motor to a van.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
M rs ; a fi' er Bagot gave a garden party at her
Aldgate house last Saturday. Her friends were
charmed with more than mere tea and sundries, for
the Bagots boast one of the show gardens of the
Hills. Its cool freshness was delightful after a
stuffy day on the plains, and a still more stuffy
journey through the tunnels of the Hills railway.
The Governor and Captain Walker have been ab-
sorbing ozone, at Kangaroo Island. Also, Mr. Dutton
gathered up his crew and some coal and provisions
the other day, and went for a three weeks’ cruise in
his yacht. These are straws which indicate which way
the sultry breath of early summer is blowing.
Government House is itself again ; in other words,
Miss Bosanquet and Captain Fletcher are back from
Melbourne.
Lawyer Burton Hardy, who was married recently,
is honeymooning at Victor Harbor.
Mr. H. J. Morrish espoused the youngest daughter
of popular “Jimmy” Aldridge last week. The Ald-
ridge horses are known to every racegoer in the
State. The wedding took place at St. Luke’s —an
old city church —and afterwards there was a recep-
tion at Richmond Park. Bridegroom Morrish is a
well-known amateur singer.
The Glenelg Sailing Club broke open on Satur-
day, and a goodly crowd looked on and sustained it-
self with refreshments, the while, in the kiosk at the
end of the Glenelg j'etty.
The normally somnolent hamlet of Robe is sizzling
with excitement just now. The cause is a sensa-
tional slander action, whose dramatis personae are
well-known local folks. From a tangle of “did”
and “didn’t” the outsider learns that the real
trouble was an undesired engagement and certain
anonymous letters, the authorship of which, it is
alleged, can be clearly proved.
The Irvings have gone, and we are the sadder for
it. Adelaide admired them almost as much off the
stage as it did on it, and would have fed them, free
of charge, day and night, had the distinguished
mummers been willing. But then there is a limit
to the eating capacity of the most distinguished
mummer.
By the way, “Louis XI.” proceeded under difficul-
ties on Monday night. D. and J. Fowler’s bulk
store caught fire about 9.30. When the audience
heard the news it started drifting out,-arguing, no
doubt, that Louis was there for six nights certain,
while the fire was a purely one-night stunt. The
actors looked sick, like the silver-tongued orator who
w’as deserted by his spell-bound audience on account
of a dog-ngnt transpiring in the next street.
L. J. Reidall our Rhodes scholar of 1908—is home
again. He s a cousin of Mrs. Harry Dutton, one of
Adelaide s fairest women.
the wrangle over the proposed moving of Govern-
ment House continues, and Treasurer Vaughan an-
nounces that the Rostrevor estate is under considera-
tion. Rostrevor lies at the foot of the Hills, near
Marialta, and was at one time the home of the Ross
Reids. It is now owned by other Reids, who hail
trom Victoria.
Died on Saturday, at Burnside, Miss G. E. Clark.
She did a lot to make the work of the State
Children s Department a success, and was one of the
first to agitate for proper care of the children of des-
titute parents. Also, she wrote prose and verse of
some merit.
A suicide t’other day displayed a creditable sense
of the fitness of things. He shook off his mortal coil
in West Terrace Cemetery. Your average self-
slayer has an exasperating habit of severing his iugu-
lar, or blowing his head off, bang in the middle of
an expensive new carpet, and in some cherished
apartment which no one wants to have crowded with
Horrible Associations.
On Saturday, the Governor and other notables as-
sembled in the banqueting-room. at the Town Hall,
to say good-bye to Dr. Mawson and his partv. The
usual remarks were made; only as the guests were
leaving for an unusual destination, the remarks were
a shade less usual than they usually are. The ex-
plorers departed by the Melbourne express, and there
were more good-byes at the railway station. The
party includes our latest Rhodes scholar, who
reached Oxford only to turn back and jpin in the
expedition.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

SLEEPLESS
WITH SCIATICA.
Feverish Nights of Suffering
With a Bad Attack*
This Man tells How he Drove
it from his System with
Dr* Williams' Pink Pills*
An attack of Sciatica causing him many
sleepless, feverish nights was endured by
Mr. Henry Wilkins, of South Fremantle,
W.A., until he drove the complaint from his
system with Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
Mr. Wilkins is a wonderful old man of
over 80 years, who now enjoys splendid
health, works about the garden, - and has
good sight, hearing and memory. He lives
with his married daughter, Mrs. M. Mala-
caki, on the Hamilton Road.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have been found
to be of great benefit in treating Sciatica,
because it is a nervous disorder, and they
have proved of great value in toning the
nerves. When interviewed by a reporter,
Mr. Wilkins said :
“I had a very nasty attack of Sciatica a
few years back. In out-door work I would
very often get wet to the waist, going
through rushes and blackberry bushes, and
I suppose this was the original cause. It
took me slowly at first, and then increased
quite rapidly. I did not lie up with it, I
never would when ill, unless absolutely
necessary, and I have generally enjoyed
splendid robust health. The pain was very
great. I could hardly walk, in fact I could
rarely go out, and I would have to press, my
hands to my hip; that was the part chiefly
affected. I dreaded the night time, for as
soon as I got settled warm in bed the pain
would start worse than ever, and bring on
retching. I would just have to lie and bear
it. I could not close my eyes until the
attack eased off, and then I might drop off
into a doze. The sweat just poured out of
me. I was so feverish, I was always long-
ing for water to drink. Sharp pains like a
knife thrust would go through the hip. I
became a bit pulled down; I could not eat
or relish my food. At last I tried Dr. W il-
liams’ Pink Pills, and gradually the Sciatica
was driven out of my system, and I am
thankful to say has never shown the least
sign of coming back.” ,
The price of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills is
2s. 9d. per box, six boxes 15s. 3d., and if you
have trouble in getting them send a postal
note for amount to the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Co. of Australasia Ltd., Sydney, and
they will be sent post free by return mail.

The failure of Victoria’s weary Premier to
move a finger towards harbor improvements
was brought right home to his own particu-
lar constituents last week. A coastal steamer
with 900 tons of Newcastle coal aboard had
to fool around off Warrnambool all night
waiting for high tide to bring it into port.
The lighthouse signalled the captain that a
ship drawing 16|ft. would be likely to ground
in the channel if it attempted to get through.
The incident will hasten a long-talked-of ex-
penditure of £150,000 in making Warrnam-
bool a more approachable inlet.
“J.R.”: Works Minister Griffith
(N.S.W.), moved by the reproaches that
have been heaped on Cockatoo Dock, has
appointed a new Board of Management,
which he described triumphantly to an in-
terviewer as follows :
The Board now contains the most expert engineers
in the whole of our public service, and they are sup-
plemented by the assistance of the gentleman who
is now president of the Civil Engineers’ Association.
To put it shortly, the chairman is an ex-
naval officer, then there are two harbor en-
gineers, one railway construction engineer,
one locomotive engineer, and an electrical
expert, with the President of an Institute
of Civil Engineers thrown in. Iu fact,
there are most of the elements requisite to
provide a convulsion.
A MAORILAND MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S
ELECTION DREAM.
TITANIA : Opposition Press.
BOTTOM : Conservatism.
TITANIA : “Thou art wise as thou art beautiful.
Oh, how I love thee! How I dote
on thee! ”
In the N.S.W. Assembly:— -
Mr. Speaker (to Contradictory- Wade) : The hon.
member must not go into tedious repetition.
Mr. Wade: I disclaim a-ny suggestion on your part
that I have been guilty of repetition of a tedious
character.
Same Man (five minutes later) : I must refer, for
the sixth time, to the argument I was endeavoring
to establish a quarter of an hour ago.
Even J. C. L. Fitzparrot hasn’t a better
record !
Little Dr. Arthur, one of the henchmen
of Gregory Wade, V.C., appeals to the emi-
grant in an article in “Australia To-Day,
1912.” Looking for arguments to persuade
Hodge and Podge to come this way, he finds
this clincher: —
The present Prime Minister of Australia was a
Scotch coal miner, and his Ministers were mostly
working men. And the Premiers and Ministers in
several of the States have also been working men,
who, by their ability and perseverance, have won
the confidence of the public!
Thus little Arthur declares that the Labor
party has gained what his own crowd has
lost.
The most absolutely conservative of the
Victorian constituencies is Evelyn, which
has returned “Father” Cameron to the Leg.
Assembly an unbroken number of times in
38 years. This time, Cameron had three
opponents who cherished the delusion that
Evelyn was growing fickle. But “Father,”
aged 81, scored about 1000 votes more than
his three audacious rivals lumped together,
and the old gent skipped hack to the House
remarking, that the confidence of his con-
stituents had flattered him.
The S. M. Herald the other day admit-
ted that it is a rotten bad prophet:—
Everyone 1 recollects that when the Labor party
first climbed into office there were dire predictions
as to the effect their rule would have on securities.
We were told that capital would leave the country,
that employment would be scarce, that profits would
decrease, and that generally we would encounter a
period of industrial paralysis. These gloomy fore-
bodings have not been fulfilled. It is true that some
capital has left the country, but employment is
more abundant than ever, and profits have never be-
fore been exceeded. Where those who predicted a
period of stagnation failed was in attributing too
great an influence to political affairs.
But how ingenuous the Herald is! It
didn’t shriek these predictions at the top of
its voice. Other people said so—“we were
told.” Still, there’s no credit for the Labor
party; it doesn’t really matter, it seems,
what pplitical party is in power. In that
case, Heaven only knows why the Herald
should go to so much trouble to kick or nag
a Labor Government out of office.
Many a time and oft has Willy Watt,
while leading the Legislative Ass, thanked
God that he was not as other men are, that
members of his party were not caucus
bound, that they had no pledge, and that in-
dividuals had a perfect right to vote accord-
ing to their consciences. In view of these
assurances, it was natural for Norman
Bayles, Toorak’s darling, to vote against
the Government occasionally. And it was
just as natural that the no-pledge Govern-
ment should remember the past misdeeds of
Bayles, and endorse Cornwall, the other
Liberal. Hereafter, “Liberals” will know
what “the right to vote according to con-
science” means.
The local Railway Com-
misioners are mixing the
same dose of trouble for Vic-
toria that the Gas Co. lately
mixed for Sydney. They de-
cline to have any truck ex-
cept with their own em-
ployees. This means that
the employee of the work-
man, who is paid to look
after their interests, isn’t re-
cognised by the Commis-
sioners, though the latter,
after all, are merely them-
selves the employees of the
people, paid to look after
their interests. In the Gas
Co.’s case, the secretary was
an employee, and when the
management sacked him, of
course the employees thought
that it was because he was
their paid union officer. As
a matter of fact, it wasn’t;
but that didn’t stop the city
being reduced to darkness,
and all the gas engines being
thrown out of gear. After
that incident, some big em-
ployers dropped the old con-
servative foolishness of “re-
fusing to recognise outsid-
ers” ; they saw that that gun
was liable to kick horribly.
But,. apparently, the Vic.
Railway Commissioners
haven’t had sense enough to
see it yet, and the Weary-
Watt Government backs
them up in their folly.
Willy Kelly, Joe Cook, Hedges and other
Federal statesmen are bitterly opposed to
the Commonwealth Bank proposals because
the future “caucus-ridden” politician may
take a bite out of it. It is probably too late
in the day to propose that publicly-owned
railways should be abolished; but suppose
Willy Kelly, Joe Cook and Hedges throw in
their free passes just to show their bona
fides.
From a man in Western Victoria:—
Labor-leader Prendergast has done his dash. He
had the chance of his life against the discredited
Murray Government, and he missed it by miles. He
is quite unknown in the country districts. During
the fray he only left Melbourne once. Then he
spoke from a pub balcony at Port Fairy—and Labor
lost the seat. He has no energy, no initiative, no
punch, no anything.
“ LIBERALISM'S ” FEDERAL
PROSPECT.
While the Caucus was recovering from the shock
it sustained at the Referenda, however, the Victorian
elections gave it another galvanic surprise. The
significance of the victory at the Federal general
elections had been greatly exaggerated.— Daily
TELEGRAPH ( triumphantly ).
The elections proved the great importance of the
women’s vote.... By continuing the splendid pro-
gress they have already made, the Liberal women of
Victoria can clinch for their party a victory at the
next Federal elections.' — Melbourne Argus (hope-
fully).
THE WEIGHTY ONE : “ But, madam , you have
merely killed one small insect!”
SHE OF THE SLIPPER : "No matter! It just
shows how you’ll be squashed the next
time I hit, so there!”
Senator Walker still hammers away at his
proposal that the State Governments of S.A.
and Westralia should present the Common-
wealth with a wide strip of land along each
side of the Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie railway.
And the idea is eminently commendable —
provided N.S.W. will present the Common-
wealth with a wide strip of land on each
side of the Yassberra-Jervis Bay railway. If
there is any shred of consistency about
Walker, he should see this point.
ASIA—1911.
[For The Bulletin.]
“The East bowed low before the blast
In silent, deep disdain” —
At least, she did in days long past,
But now she raises Cain I
n.s.w. O.O.O.
From a confirmed Laborite: —
N.S.W. Minister Griffith appears to have gone bare-
sark on brick-works, to the neglect of everything
else. He takes up whole evenings in Parliament
pushing this, a comparatively small matter, and,
meanwhile, he is supposed to have several Bills
prepared, beside which the brick-works business is
only a flea-bite. For example, there is the municipal
property franchise question, which Labor ought to
deal with in a hurry; the necessity of giving ade-
quate powers to the shire and municipal councils;
and, last, the establishment of a Greater Sydney
Council, to deal with the problems of Sydney com-
mercial and traffic congestion, which are costing the
whole State quite a heap per annum in sheer waste,
because the railway does not go to the wharfside, and
the merchandise has to be carted in between, and
has to wander up toilsome and unnecessary hills, and
down into deep valleys, at great expense. Mr.
Griffith is looking through the thick end of the
telescope at his departmental chances. To be the
author of a Greater Sydney scheme would give him
a bigger reputation than the successful flotation of
50 brick-kilns —which, anyhow, don’t need the
brains of a Minister. An intelligent clerk of works
could run them easily.
“Snell” recalls an election: —
For the first time, at a general election, the
women of Victoria had the privilege of heckling the
candidate, as full partners in the concern. Still,
women have not been wholly inactive in the past.
I remember one candidate, for Ballarat East, who
was followed about by a large, attentive woman, who
supplied him with instructions in public places. On
the occasion of his last address to the electors, he
was asked by an intelligent and independent citizen if
he was in favor of one-man-one-vote. “I am in favor
of one-man-one-vote,” he replied, most emphatically.
Up shot the female. She shook an admonitory fore-
finger at the candidate. “No, you’re not,” she said.
“You’re not in favor of one-man-one-vote.” “But —-
but,” stammered Blanker, “the committee said”-
“You’re not in favor of one-man-one-vote,” per-
sisted the matron. The candidate yielded. “Very
well, then, gentlemen,” he said, “I am not in favor
of one-man-one-vote. I submit to the will of the
majority. That lady is my better half.” He lost
his deposit.
The Argus is in the place where it is de-
manded of conscience to speak the truth;
but it likes to choose its own time for put-
ting itself to that discomfort. On Novem-
ber 21—well after the elections —it pub-
lished a leading article exposing the shame-
less political bargaining which took place
just before the tussle, with the object of
shunting Murray into a billet and making
Watt Premier. It enumerated all the jobs
that might be offered to Weary John, and
showed his unsuitableness for all of them.
Concerning the Agency in London it said:—
The tale has been told for years that the State
needs, in the Agent-General’s Office, a “hustling”
man of affairs. The Premier’s best friends would
“grin” to hear him described as an energetic, in-
ventive Agent-General.
And, again
Public positions which require vigorous and ex-
pert administration are not to be made a conven-
ience for tired politicians.
Yet this is the man whom the Argus fought
for as the head of a “vigorous and progres-
sive party.” He won’t do as Agent-General,
but he was quite fit to be Premier.
N.S.W. Minister Carmichael has skied his
portfolio under unlucky circumstances.
Campbell Nairn Moir, the young man who
was arrested in Melbourne, charged with the
murder of Henry Trevascus, of Glebe, Syd-
ney, the mysterious old man who dealt in
and boiled down stolen property, is his
nephew. The lad will be tried, and he may
be convicted, and if
he is convicted his
case will comeVbefore
the Cabinet for con-
sideration. So, look-
ing a long way ahead,
Carmichael rec-
kons tnat the honest
thing is to get out of
the Cabinet early.
The Weary Govern-
ment has been in
office for nearly three
years, and has
kept intermittently
talking about its tech-
nical education propo-
sals ; yet, so far, all it
has actually accom-
plished has been to re-
duce the annual grant
to the Melbourne
workmen’s College—
the only general es-
tablishment of its
class in the State. The
College Council de-
clares that hundreds
of students have to be
refused admission be-
cause of the lack of
accommodation and of
funds to pay the
necessary tea c h ers.
With technical educa-
tion thus neglected,
and proper instruc-
tion of apprentices
practically non-existent, Victoria is los-
ing its place as a manufacturing State,
and its trade will steadily fall a more and
more easy prey to the foreigner.
In mishandling the Commonwealth Bank
Bill the Opposition really ought to make up
its mind which lie it will tell. One moment
it alleges that the Governor will be a despot,
who will be utterly independent of Parlia-
ment ; the next moment it says he will be a
mere tool who will allow his ear to be bitten
by politicians, who in their turn will have
their ears bitten by constituents; and this
picture of a despotic worm or autocratic
caterpillar is so vivid that it is disturbing
our sleep.
THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A boy named Sun Lee was charged yesterday with
having attempted to bribe a police constable in
Cairns. —Queensland News Item.
In Cairns, the constables (we read)
Are very, very good indeed!
In vain old Satan spreads his lure —
The Cairns policeman’s heart is pure,
And bribes have no effect, of course,
On members of the local force!
In other towns we needn’t name
There have been instances — Oh, shame !
Where constables have given way,
When they were shown that it would pay.
Ah me! I do not care to speak
Of this, but Human Nature’s weak;
And that is why, when all is told,

BILIOUS ATTACKS.
UNABLE TO WORK, BUT DR. MORSE’S
INDIAN ROOT PILLS BROUGHT
INSTANT RELIEF.
Probably there is no complaint so common
as bilious attacks. Men, women and children
are subject to them, and while they last li e
is made miserable. They are accompanied
by sick headaches. The liver is not doing
its duty. That is the cause, and as soon as
the liver receives the proper assistance, the
digestive organs move along smoothli again.
For this complaint Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills are unrivalled. They get at the cause,
which is the liver. “I have frequently suf-
fered from severe bilious attacks, writes
Miss Sybil Slingsby, TO Abercrombie Street.
Redfern, “and violent headaches, which in-
capacitated me from work. I found, how-
ever, on taking a dose of Dr Morse’s Indian
Root Pills on retiring at night, that 1 would
be quite well the next day. I cannot speak
too highly of them, and willingly recommend
them to others. You may use this if you de-
sire.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
“Har”: F. R. Foster takes the eye as the
best batsman in Warner’s team ; and the figures thus
far justify the opinion. Against S. Aus. the youthful
player banged a century ; the Victorian bowlers also
had a century debited against them; while a well
played 22 (and out to a brilliant catch by Gregory)
was the reward of the first innings against N.S.W.
Foster is vigorous, and his style is the hand-
somest on the English side. Of course, style is
not everything, and when the final figures are up,
it may prove that somebody with a much more
camel .ike fashion of play has produced better re-
sults, but Foster is good to look upon when he smites
and gives value for the money. *
Warner’s team has struck hard luck early.
The skipper is in hospital, ill enough to keep him
out of action till after the first Test at Sydney, on
December 15. George Gunn is also in dock, nursing
a broken hand —the result of collision with a ball fur-
nished by Minnett- on the first day of the N.S.W.
match.
Refreshed by an easy victory over S. Aus-
tralia and a difficult one over Victoria; the English
XI waded into N.S.W. at the Sydney Cricket Ground,
last Friday. The dampness of the wicket put off
the start for a while, and when the spin of the coin
favored Trumper, the N.S.W. captain heathenishly
presented the other side with the first use of the strip
of mud and soft earth. And'* the M.C.C. gripped the
bat all the rest of the afternoon, scoring 151 runs
in 203 min., for the loss of only four wickets —a
repetition, though with better excuse, of the funereal
methods pursued in the other States on the way
round. Gunn’s 50 runs in 129 min. in the mud was
good; albeit, he was lucky at being twice missed by
Hordern when in the twenties. Mead’s 41 in 145 min.
was tdo slow and weary for any adjective to fit it,
yet it was something to stay in at all under the
muddy conditions. The other batsmen were in long
enough to make a tall score ; but they left little for
the pencillers to worry about. At the same time, the
first day’s play threw into the limelight tile poor
quality of N.S.W. bowling on a wicket where it was
easy to turn the ball.
On Saturday, the moist condition of the premises,
after a drizzling shower, kept the players in the
pavilion or the bar or some other cool spot, and a
crowd of 8000, lingering damply outside the gates,
saved its money and whiled away the time throwing
advice at junior players in Moore Dark, dm cue
weather conditions were better on Monday, and
England lifted the score to 238 before the curtain
dropped on the innings—the last six wickets only
adding 87 runs to the total, of which Woolley piled
up 43, Foster 22, and Sundries 19. Of the N.S.W.
trundlers, Cotter finished with the best figures—four
wickets for 45 runs, and the pace and accuracy were
both good when the conditions were such that a
foothold could be found. The balance of the wickets
were divided between Hordern (three for 62) and
Folkard (two for 45), and, generally, the proceed-
ings weren’t anything to glory over. The sorry
point about the bowling was that Cotter gave away
four no-balls and Macartney and Minnett one each.
The N.S.W. innings was as flat as a Salv’army band,
Trumper and Macartney went out lor one run eacn,
and McElhone failed to score at all; but Gregory
(the young old man) piled up a lucky 66. Barbour
scored a slow and meritorious 37. Minnett hatted
heartily for 52 (not out), and Bardsley piled up 24.
At the close of time, eight wickets had dropped tor
198 runs —an even worse predicament than that of
the Englishmen at the same stage. The drought
broke again on Tuesday, in so firm and persistent a
fashion that play was impossible all day.- As the
game is limited to four days, and two of them have
been lost, that flat and dreary object called a draw
was inevitable.
* * * *
South Australia had its reputation rubbed
in the mire well and good for the third time this
season, when the Cabbage Gardeners downed its
representative eleven by an innings and 135 runs
to spa re Vic., in its first knock, compiled 553, a
large job, which shows that, so far, the influence of
Weary has not extended to the cricket arena. South
Oss replied with the fury of a turned worm, to the
tune of 232, and, following on, added only 18b. the
main feature of the rout was Armstrong’s score ot
250. Allowing for two chances which he gave, it
was a clinking display, and satisfied the crowd that
the fast bowling of Time is not perceptibly wearing
out his pitch. It was quite in accordance with his
habit to commence the season’s big matches with
small profits and quick returns, his books, up to this
deal with S.A. showing only 9, 13, 0, 9. The two
latter entries were in account with the firm oi
Warner and Co., but business on that scale is not
likely to be continued. The big man s score of 250
marks his record in inter-State play, his previous
best being 231, which was also served, up to South
Oss three years ago. His record score of 438 was
made in club cricket in Melbourne. Seitz, who also
ran into three figures (101), in Vic.’s one innings,
played stylish cricket, but he might have been caught
at 10, if the S.A. slip men had thought of it m time.
The match seems to provide reasonable support, it
more was necessary after the innings walloping it
received from Warner’s outfit, that cricket in South
Australia is in a bad way this season. Oertainiy, the
bowling has been made to look as if a change would
do it no harm, no less than 1096 runs having been
slashed off it by the Englishmen and Victorians in
two innings, which works out at an average of about
50 runs per opposing bat. As for the batting, it has
not been much better than the fielding and the work
in that branch has been of a quality calculated to en-
grave on the records nothing more enduring than a
stagnant egg. Armstrong, for instance, was given
two lives before being finally caught by Mayne—once
aT°73, and once (dead easy) at 209—and a complete
list of all the mistakes would require the services of
a tally clerk. If improvement is not shown by S.A.
before 7 the match against Ma, goodness knows what
will happen. * * *
Vic batsman J. N. Seitz has a liking for
Sa' bowlers. In the first match, played a few weeks
ago and won by Vic. with four wickets in hand, he
ufle’d un a centurv; last week he scored another
two solFd facts which buttress his chance of a place
the Australian XI. If he were not so slow in the
field, the chance would be considerably improved.
Five years ago, when the Melbourne
Cricket Club was beaten in its effort to snavel tne
control of Australian cricket, and constitute itself
the Marylebone C.C. of the Commonwealth, it fell
further in the soup than it thought. It was given
its fair share of representation when the V.C.A. was
constituted, and also the right to nominate one
member of the Board of Control; but that was mere
shadow, inasmuch as it is always in a minority in a
place where the majority rules. The other day a
young Tasmanian batsman, named H. O. Smith,
came across the Straits, and, settling in South Mel-
bourne, applied to play with that team under the
district cricket scheme. Before he got a chance to
don flannels, ah emissary of the M.C.C. took him
and planted him in a city coffee palace, and invited
him to play with the big club. The V.C.A. execu-
tive, however, curtly ordered him to play with South,
which he did. The M.C.C. appealed to the V.C.A.,
which upheld its executive —the M.C.C. delegates
alone dissenting—and that, should end the argument.
The club applied in August last to be allowed to
enter the pennant competition, and, though the ap-
plication came very late, was told it could do so on
the ordinary terms, i.e., take a defined district and
give up its right to a special delegate on the Board
of Control. It refused these terms, and wanted extra
consideration, that it might keep itself in the lead-
ing position. Now it perceives that if it isn’t to
get any rising new players, and can offer no induce-
ment, by pennant chances, to others to join its play-
ing ranks, it is liable shortly to become a thing of
naught, a mere lessee of a paddock, which a con-
trolling body may take over some day.
The benefit performance arranged by Hugh
D. Mclntosh at the Stadium (Sydney) last Monday
night, in aid of the dependents of the men lost in
the steamers Rosedale and Macleay, panned out
£4BO, and the only person who had a bad word to
say for the charitable act was one Mrs. E. A. Blow,
State President of the Wimmin’s Ker-ristian Temper-
ance Union. She wrote to the press to allege that
“prize fighting is not only inimical to the best in-
terests of our city, but that...it is altogether un-
worthy to be associated with the high ideals of
charity.” As she expressed no objection to young
girls cadging in the streets and hotels from strange
men, and using their Eve-bequeathed allurements to
obtain hard cash for charity on Hospital Saturday
and such like occasions, presumably she favors that
method. Which shows one more of the peculiar
kinks in the religious mind.
The postponed disturbances between Jack
Reid and Sid Sullivan and Piccato and Higgins will
(d.v.) take place at the Stadium on December 2 and
December 6 respectively.

“Gaul”: I see Langford told the M.L.
reporters that referee Eugene Corri should have de-
clared his last fight with McVea a win instead of a
draw, and that on Boxing Day he proposes to com-
pletely exterminate the Pride of Paris. The odds
are that, far from exterminating McVea, Langford
will get licked on the 26th. Consider the circum-
stances. Langford depends for success mainly on
his amazing punch and his capacity to stand still
and take punishment. (He has a theory that a
boxer’s hands and arms are meant for hitting
purposes alone, and, accordingly, he does not
even attempt to take punches on the gloves
or arms.) In Paris the two champions fought
in a small, primitive ring, with small, primi-
tive gloves. On Boxing Day they will battle in a 20ft.
enclosure, floor-coveted,' and padded as to the sup-
ports which hold the ropes. And they will use big
gloves. Obviously, the change will be all in McVea’s
favor. If Langford couldn’t put McVea out with the
punishing little gloves that are used abroad, he is un-
likely to damage him much with the pillow-like
affairs that N. S. Wales insists on. Of course, one
of Langford’s terrific smites may land fairly, in which
case it is all over with McVea. But mainly it looks
like being a boxing contest, and in the matter of
boxing ability, McVea is admittedly the smaller
coon’s master, every time.
“D.”: A feature of the reception to the
visiting band of boxers, which occurred in Sydney on
Monday, was a stark defiance hurled at the goloshes
of Wowserdom by Mclntosh and other speakers. It
appears that Stiggins and the rest of the brethren
who, though they have never seen a boxing contest,
insist on representing it as a loathly spectacle, which
contains most of the worst features of bull-baiting
and cock-fighting, are to be fought hard, politically
and otherwise. There are big possibilities about the
scheme, if a skilful organiser is only found, with
sufficient energy to push it along. The local kill-
joys are an insignificant crowd numerically, though
they have a useful gift for blatant noise. It is in-
disputable that the abolition of boxing is but a
minor plank in their dreary platform. Racing, surf-
ing, picture-shows, Sunday trams and trains, and a
hundred other popular institutions would go if the
Wowser had his way. Once it is understood that
an organised sporting vote is straining in the leash,
avid to lodge itself against the candidate, whatever
his political views, who is committed to the Wowser
ticket, there should be an abrupt slump in ultra-
sanctimonious Parliamentarians, aldermen, etc. Of
course, the business of getting the vote together is a
sizeable one. But there is nothing insuperable about
it. Nine males put of ten cordially hate a Wowser,
and the local girl, as her education improves and
her outlook on life becomes enlarged, is getting to
think the same way. In fact, the time is just about
ripe for a movement that shall make the Stiggins
ticket as unpopular as Freetrade.

“Vulcan”: One C. Gorman, a Victorian
motor cyclist, recently tried conclusions with the
Weary State’s railway system—with ludicrous results
for the system. Running from Ballarat to Melbourne,
his actual riding time was lhr. 56min., just one hour
under the Adelaide “express’s” time over the same
distance!

N.S.W. League of Wheelmen, after chew-
ing the cud of reflection, has decided that £5OO is
quite enough for the first prize in the six days’ race,
promoted by the J. D. Williams Co. for January 1,
at Sydney Cricket Ground. So a slight redistribu-
tion of the money has been made. The same amount
is put up, but it is spread out somewhat differently.
The second pair will divide £2OO, the third £lOO,
the fourth £75, fifth £5O, sixth, seventh, and
eighth £25 each team, and all unplaced teams com-
pleting 1800 miles will receive a bonus of £lO.
Already seven teams have nominated, of which Ivor
Lawson and Mitten claim to represent the U.S.A.;
McNamara and Corry, N.S.W.; Rodgers and Sulli-
van, Queensland; Goullett and Hehir, Victoria;
Hemy and Crook, the town of Forbes (N.S.W.) ; and
Grenda and Walker are Tasmania and Victoria com-
bined, just as Coroneo and Redford represent an
amalgamation of the Ma State and S.A. Come to
think of it, barring the first pair home, they will all
earn their money. It’s a better game to watch than
take part in.
* * * *
The N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union made a cheer-
ful hee-haw of itself by forbidding members of the
Motor Cycle Club of N.S.W., an affiliated body, to
take part in the big dispatch relay ride from
Adelaide to Sydney, which is being organised by the
Dunlop Rubber Co. The sole reason is that some
of the foot cyclists are admittedly professionals, so
any amateurs taking part, ever so remotely, in the
same upheaval, will be disqualified. The motor-bike
clubs of South Australia and Victoria have not for-
bidden their members to take part, and, as there are
enough motor-bikists outside the club to do the job,
the dispatch will be carried through all right. And,
for that matter, a number of members of the club
have signified their intention of keeping to the
arrangements made, and taking the consequences.
But, although this insanity will not affect the Dun-
lop Rubber Co.’s great test, it may possibly make a
hole in the Cyclists’ Union. Many motor-bike people
were previously convinced that their club would do
better if they had a governing body of their own;
and this Thomas rot has convinced them that the
time is ripe. The dispatch ride is not a race between
individuals at all; but a test, to discover whether
foot-bikes, power-cycles or motor-cars are the best
implements for dispatch work in time of national
stress. There isn’t a prize of any sort to be awarded.
The only gaud is a plain medallion, to be presented
to every rider in every section to prove that he took
part in the test.
W. Tormey, the N.S.W. motor-bikist who
knocked 14hr. 40min. off the record between Mel-
bourne and Sydney, had a fairly rough time of it.
Big as was the hole he made in the record, it would
have been larger had he not got held up after leaving
Yass, owing to his lamps failing. He had ridden
somewhere about 90 miles in the dark, and, when he
slithered down a bank, and stopped with a crash, he
decided to stay where he was and wait for daylight.
His troubles started early, for he was. not 10 miles
from Melbourne when he collided with a cow. When
he got to Goulburn he could hardly keep awake, and
was quite knocked up. But Tormey is tough and
well seasoned, and he pulled himself together for
the final effort, and struggled through. He rode 575
miles without rest or sleep, and covered the distance
in 34 hours, equal to nearly 17 miles per hour.

J. D. Williams announces an increase in
the prize-money to be splashed round on the Six
Days’ Race at Sydney, in January next year. The
first prize in the week-long grind will be £7OO, the
second £2OO, the third £5O, the fourth £3O, the
fifth £2O. And on top of all this loot it is an-
nounced that a special prize of £lO will be given to
the teams . covering 1800 miles, and free board and
residence will be provided for the competitors. Alto-
gether, the bait hung out is tempting enough to
bring the whole cycling world to Australia. Ivor
Lawson, \Vho calls himself “the speed merchant,” is
on board' the Zealandia, accompanied by J. W.
Mitten, who is quite an unknown man in Australia,
but a flier of some parts in his ain couiitree. Lang-
ford, the apostle of peace, is also on the same boat.

The tennis carnival in Melbourne discov-
ered no new top-notchers, though there was a surfeit
of good players from which to choose Brookes’s part-
ners in the Davis Oup matches. First came the
inter-State matches, in which Ma and the Cabbage
Garden stood about level, but the latter’s possession
of Norman Brookes gave her aslight superiority.
At the finish, Ma had won five Doubles rubbers to
Vic.’s four, and five, in the Singles, to the other’s
seven. Totals: Ma, 10 rubbersViei,, 11. The
Weary State’s second team, though it boasted two
promising youngsters in E. E. Herring and G. L.
Patterson, was no match for South' Aus., which an-
nexed 14 rubbers to Victoria’s seven. The Weary
State ladies had things all their own way, one team
extinguishing the Croweater girls by 10 rubbers to
two, and another a team of Apple Island demoiselles
by 12 rubbers to nil. On Monday began the struggles
for the Singles and Doubles Championships of Aus-
tralasia, and the ' Ladies’ Singles and Doubles and
Mixed Doubles Championships of Victoria. As, day
by day the weaker ones were weeded out, it was
seen that Brookes —swift to decide, quick to antici-
pate, unerring in timing and skilful in manoeuvring—
stood in a class by himself, while Heath, Rice,
Lycett and one or two others led the rest of the
field. At the end, Miss L. Addison won the Singles
from Miss G. Wilmoth; Misses Gyton and Le
Neveu the Doubles from Misses L. Addison and A.
Watson, and the same little Miss Gyton and R. Lycett
the Mixed Doubles from Miss Stewart and A. Camp-
bell. In the Australasian Singles_ Championship final,
Brookes gave no chance, to Rice (N.S.W.), and
won in straight sets (6 —-1, 6—2, 6—3). In the
Doubles Championship final the same Brookes, with
J. J. Addison, encountered Heath and Lycett, and,
very largely owing to Lycett’s resistless attack, the
latter pair won. The plump Miss Waxman, who
moves gradually, but gets there with dead certainty,
annexed the Ladies’ Schools Championship for the
second year; and, in conjunction with schoolboy B.
D. Wilson (owe 30) defeated Private Sec. Vernon
and Lady Denman (rec. 3), in th,e semi-final of the
Mixed Doubles Handicap. At the end of the games
Brookes chose A. W. Dunlop, Heath, Lycett and him-
self to represent Australasia in the Davis Cup fight
with America, in M.L., at Christmas. On Monday,
however, Lycett announced that, for business reasons,
he wouldn’t be able to go to M.L. Whereupon
“Horrie” Rice was asked to fill the vacant niche. At
latest, Rice intended to accept, provided business was
willing. As at present constituted, the team is a
good one —as good, say some of the cognoscenti, as
could possibly have been ’got together.

With the Dunn Challenge Shield results
before them, the big dogs of N.S.W. amateur athletics
did not take long to nose out a representative team
for the Australasian championships meeting in
Maoriland next month. In less than three days the
selectors had picked six athletes and a manager.
Taking it all round, it was a good selection out of
the material available, but there is a general com-
plaint that there is a serious omission in the matter
of long-distance running. Practically the team hasn’t
a long-distance man in it; while in the matter of
jumping, it is as strong as the State can afford. It
includes all the best jumpers, as far as
they can be ascertained, although it is quite possible
that there are plenty of fine, athletic young fellows
who could clear a higher fence if a bull were in pur-
suit. But the trouble is that the selectors and the
bull are never together at the psychological moment.
The longest-distance man in the team is W. F. Pat-
tinson, of Sydney University, and his achievements
are only of the 880yds. order. At present he holds
the State record for 440yds. and 880yds. Barring
the failure to find a good long-range runner, the
team, on form displayed, is absolutely the best that
could have been chosen, and does the selectors proud.

The howl, not to say bellow, of the Wow-
ser, that the abolition of the bookmaker would merely
result in a wild, general plunge on the totalisator
(provided there was one in the vicinity), seems t:o
receive a wretchedly poor advertisement from the
advance sheets of the Maoriland Year Book. For
the year ending March 31, 1911, the money planked
on the machine amounted to £1,933,534, which is a
decrease of £96,892, compared with the previous
year, when the bookmaker was very much more rau-
cous in the land. And racing has decreased to the
extent of 36 race days. The rise of the Government
tax, from 1$ to 21 per cent., brought into the State
revenue £48,338, as against £29,645 for 1909-10.
Melbourne Cup meeting is usually re-
garded as a carnival of horse, but when one begins
to probe into it, the shivoo was as much a carnival
of automobile as anything else. On every day of
the meeting the management was worn out with the
task of finding accommodation for at least 800 cars,
and on Cup Day no less than 830 cars were packed
into the inner and outer paddocks at Flemmgton.
At a low estimate this means that on Cup Day there
were £350,000 worth of automobiles in the pad-
docks. Now, where does the horse stand in com-
parison ? * *
It’s difficult to know whether to regard
Hackenschmidt as a sport of purest ray serene, or as
a howling joke. From his palatial quarters in the
HStel de Louvre, Paris, on September 27, Hack-
issued to the world’s press a statement re his recent
defeat by Gotch, the Yankee. Boiled down, his state-
ment is that, while practising on board the Olympic
with Dr. Roller, his left knee went out of joint. It
had no chance of being well in time for the ’rastle,
but, as to refuse to go on meant ruin to the pro-
moter, Hack decided that he must make some sort of
showing. To safeguard his backers, he demanded
that all bets should be declared off, and then he
went into the ring to be chawed up. Gotch chawed
him up in short order* It is pleasing to learn that
the great wrestler’s leg is now on the fair way to
recovery. So, for the next few months, he will
browse through Europe, leading the pleasant life, and
dreaming of victories to come, for at the present the
big fellow has no idea of retiring from the game.
Last week, Dick Arnst aimed another
offer at the head of Ed. Durnan. He is willing to
go to Toronto and raise a dust over the world’s scull-
ing championship, provided the exes, are lifted to
£250 —£150 was previously offered by the Cana-
dian’s backers. And, of course, there is to be a satis-
factory arrangement about “gate.” A reply is now
awaited. At the same time, Arnst notifies that Eng-
lishman Barry can have a race on the Thames, pro-
vided he puts up £750 expenses before Richard
begins to pack his port; and as Barry’s backers
won’t go beyond £5OO, and Barry will not come to
Australia, no matter what inducement is held aloft,
that match is apparently right off. There are com-
paratively few “gate” possibilities on the Thames,
anyhow. *
The Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron handi-
cap, on Saturday, proved a very easy thing for Mr.
Jones’s Thelma. Five yachts joined in the flying
start; it was only an alleged flying start, the weak
south-east wind being too languid for anything but a
mosquito to fly in with any energy. However, the
Thelma caught what breeze there was, and lolled to
the front in a weary way. And there it stayed till
the end, winning by 3inin. llsec. from Culwuila and
Yeulba, in that order. Thelma is doing well this
season.
The first section of the inter-State swim-
ming carnival (under the wing of the N.S.W.
League of Swimmers), began at the Municipal
Baths (Sydney), on Saturday, when plungers from
S. Aus., Maoriland and Bananaland dived for the
spoil. The big event of the afternoon was the first
part of the all-comers’ championship, over 110yds.,
with O. Dickman (N.S.W.), after a joyful race,
won with inches to spare from A. R. Harrower.
The ladies disported themselves in a couple
of handicaps, before the admiring gaze of
that superior and sometimes supercilious animal,
man. A side issue of the afternoon was a
bundle of disqualifications for swimming too fast —
otherwise, “breaking the time.” When competitors
entered, they had to sign a declaration as to their
previous best times in similar events, but, appar-
ently, many of them forgot what the previous best
was, and they mostly forgot in one direction —pos-
sibly with a view to getting better handicaps—and
the previous bests were punctured so consistently
that the authorities had an extra busy time slaying
competitors. Of 15 heat winners during the after-
noon 13 were officially corpsed for their hurriedness.
The handicapping of competitors on their own simple
faith in their swimming speed isn’t along the lines
of improvement in the sport, and knocks endways
any hope of record times creeping on the slate;
therefore, the controlling body would act wisely if
the innovation was presented to the undertaker.
The dead and unmannerly whale which
lately lumbered ashore at Dee Why, near Manly
(N.S.W.), was a sore trial to surf-bathers, and for a
time a favorite sport was practically off. Not only
did the rancid monster pervade the air, but it at-
tracted multitudes of sharks, so it was a double-
barrelled drawback. At low water, the derelict was
apparently the property of the Sal. Army, for it
rested on Army land. At high tide, when it was
a-wash, it seemed to belong to the Harbor Trust, or
the Chief Secretary, or the Fisheries Department.
But no one claimed it. Finally, some wise hero took
his life in his hands, and holding an antiseptic table-
cloth to his nose, set the blubberous visitant on Are.
It blazed magnificently for a while, and was still
smouldering when this issue went to press. Still, it
is feared that some tons of remnants will remain.
For later information see the S. M. Herald s On
the Land” column. #
The Sydney swimmers are raging about
the delay iri collecting a team for the Olympian
games at Stockholm, next year. Stockholm is a
long way off, and the Olympiad will start in Juij ■
so it is argued that it is time the Amateur Sporting
Federation, which represents the Olympic Council
in these territories, got a move on- And there is
something in the idea. The best way to choose the
men would be to get the names of all those who can
go, and then start a series of elimination matches.
Then we should be certain that the continent would
be well and truly represented. Probably the ques-
tion of finance has something with the^aela^.
Sydney Swimming Club will send a team
to Auckland (M.L.) to hold a series of contests with
the Waitemata Club, which is the boss crowd of
swimmers in the Ricketty Isles Among its mem-
bers are the giants of Maoriland swimming. Natur-
ally, the Waitemata crowd desires the majority ot
events to be individual contests, and also very
naturally, the Sydney club is anxious that the pro-
gramme should consist entirely of team contest..
Writer’s opinion is that it should consist of both.

What agony—what suffering and despondency Piles create.
And how tew are the remedies which give lasting relief. Oint-
ments, salves and other outward applications are of no avail;
sometimes alleviating the pain temporarily, but oftentimes ag-
gravating it.
The direct way to relief and cure is to take Murphy’s Pile
Pills. They work Nature’s way by cleansing the system of all
impurities, healing the affected parts, restoring the health; they
give instant relief, and unfailingly effect a permanent cure. They
are non-aperient, perfectly harmless, ajjd equally effective in
either recent or long-stancyng cases of internal and external
Piles.

SOCIETY OF ARTISTS’ SHOW.
Last week, at the Queen Victoria Markets (Sydney),
the Exhibition of the Society of Artists was thrown
open. It was not formally opened by the Governor
or Gaud Mayor, like a tin of pickled rhubarb or a
box of sardines, but blossomed out spontaneously
like a spring flower, which shows that even the intel-
lectual can overcome the habits of barbarism. As
an exhibition it is an improvement on that of last
year, as last year’s was an improvement on that of
the year before; so that, assuming improvement con-
tinues each year, the long-debated question, “What is
Art? is in a fair way to be answered definitely.
The secretary of the Society of Artists will nail it
on the door of the Spring Exhibition in the year
blankteen hundred and thingumbob, in the simple
woids: “Gallery now open. Admission, Is. Cata-
logues free.” The last concession is bound to come;
and counter lunch may yet have to be thrown in.
It could be tried now with advantage, in view of
the few people who visit the exhibitions of Australian
talent. Even free beer would be justified ; and, with
free beer, Art would take its proper place in the
affections of the populace. However, this year’s show
will have to pull through the heavy track of Indif-
feience without more help than it receives from its
own strength. The fine work done by the Lindsays,
Rodway, Hilder, Lambert, Blamire Young and
Ambrose Patterson alone presents good reason why
the exhibition should receive attention and encourage-
ment.
The black and white section is mostly Norman
Lindsay, so excellent that even the trustees of the
National Gallery have, at last, been brought to a
knowledge of his skill and artistic sense. Two of
Ins exhibits “Home Again” and “Alexander,” have
been purchased, at the paltry cost of 24 guineas, but,
good as they are, they do not represent the character-
istic work of Lindsay as it should be represented in
the permanent Gallery. “Home Again” depicts a
couple of long-ago sailors, returned from the Strange
Seas, with the curious treasure-trove beloved of the
fo c sle, being welcomed on the landing-stage by the
women of the period. Lindsay has marked with
unique hand the expression of his characters—on the
faces of the men, the rough joy of home-coming, and
the pleasure of giving away their curios and sub-
stance even to trollops; on the faces of the women—
the eternal Tambers-down”—the cajolement born
of the desire of loot. It is a fine example of the
artist s power. The other work of his purchased by
the trustees, represents Alexander heading a charge of
cavalry against Darius, or somebody who appears
marked for trouble. But the most characteristic
work of Norman Lindsay is “The Argument,” an
illustration of Rabelais’s creations, who moved round
the knees of that outsize in philosophic giants,
Pantagruel. The picture adds to Lindsay’s reputa-
tion as a satirist of the human emotions, and it will
be interesting 1 to follow its future movements.
Lionel Lindsay exhibits nine or ten etchings, of
which five, representing portions of Old Sydney
have been purchased for the National Gallery. Each
is a gem but none is better than a study of Miller’s
Point, which was not bought by the trustees.
Another picture acquired, for the Gallery is a
nater-color by J. J. Hilder, entitled “The Dry
, a f°° ri ‘ ** lmpresses the visitor even more than
fn whioh h i ISland ” last year - The ™nner
IXth,, V' eeS / 1 ” IVer throi, £ h noonday haze
above the sun-burnt grass stubble, is an almost un-
forgettable lesson in delicacy.
t qUi^ e adifferent type is Ambrose Patterson’s
bold treatment of Oollins-street, Melbourne-another
Gallery purchase. The very business of the street—
m spirit of its activity depicted
n the half-finished skyscraper—impresses itself upon
the onlooker until he almost expects to hear the
clang of a tram-bell, or see a stout, perspiring citizen
suddenly disappear from the sidewalk into an ad-
jacent drinkery.
Of those artists whose efforts did not meet with
the full approval of the trustees, choice of interest
goes to Florence Rodway’s pastels, and the best of
these is the head of Hemy Lawson’s little son. In
its way. it is as striking as Longstaff’s picture of the
father. Like that fine drawing of boy Wunderlich, it
was merely lent to the exhibition, in her ambitious
oil-color portrait of Miss Rose Scott, Miss Rodway
made the mistake of not presenting the Rose Scott
that the public knows, but introduced an older,
sterner Rose Scott, minus those touches of .fluff and
color without which no Rose Scott could possibly
be complete. “The Model,” a nude, is a bit raw —
that is to say, the painting is a bit raw—but it
isn t as naked and unashamed as another in its
vicinity by Harley Griffiths. He has entitled it
On the other hand, his small canvas,
“The Bay,” is charming.
Absentees George W. Lambert and Arthur Streeton
are on the walls, the former with a technicality
named “The Shop” (lent by Hugo R. Meyer), and
the latter with a couple of water-colors of no more
than passing interest. Lambert is more Lambert-like
in his bigger canvas, “The First Voyage to Aus-
tralia” (“three vessels weighed anchor from Lima on
that memorable day”).
Quite a considerable portion of the exhibition is
made up of loaned canvases, amongst which appear
a couple of alluring fans by Charles Conder (de-
ceased), and a sketch of Bronte beach by the same
skilful brush.
The other exhibitors will have to go short in these
strenuous times, when there isn’t sufficient space to
speak the truth even about that beautiful artist,
Charles Gregory Wade; but Julian Ashton deserves a
line for his nude in the black leggings, and The
Bulletin proposes to forward it as soon as the
week’s washing is brought in. Ruby Winckler illus-
trates Omar Khayyam with the same tints as danced
in the glass of the old pub expert (he knew nearly
as much about pubs as the Oldest Inhabitant). W.
Hardy Wilson and Isobel McWhannell are happy in
their characteristic color handling. Thea Proctor’s
fan isn’t as good as Conder’s, but anybody who loses
it for that reason has got money to burn. Blamire ,
Young deserves a handful of praise for his rich color : :
work in “The Silver Dish,” and, probably, two other
canvases hung in a dark corner. And Mildred Lovett
(miniatures), E. Gruner, George Clint and one or
two others have not altogether wasted the year.
There are also several misguided people whose
efforts to bring discredit on their surroundings have
been fairly successful, but, owing to the approach of
the peace-and-goodwill season, they are merely
cautioned. Next year, if they are still on the pre-
mises, they will be lured into the cupboard behind
the stairs, and carefully butchered.
Bert Levy, the Australian black-and-white
man, has wisely developed his talent for
Jewish portraiture, and his acquaintance
with Jewish institutions, since he left these
parts. New York Herald lately published
a number of striking drawings, wifli descrjp-
tl7(Uetter'press by Levy > under the heading
of Submerged Scholars of the Ghetto.” In
this and other such work, Levy appears as
the. interesting specialist—-the handsome Jew
insisting on the picturesqueness of the
Hebrew race. He talks of having often wan-
dered into the Ghetto societies for the study
ol Hebrew literature, “grateful that my
Jewish face and blood gave me the privilege
to sit and sketch among them,” and, as an
Austrahan, he regrets that this country has
no Ghettos, and no notion of the Jew who
possesses a soul above monish matters.

<Weakness
was cured by
SCOTT’S
Emulsion
which the Doctor had or-
dered. Mr. George Schwebel,
28 John Street, Erskineville,
Sydney, N.S.W. writes (2nd
July, ’10) that:
“My son, aged 4, caught a cold, which
turned to pneumonia and pleurisy, and
he was left very iveak, pale and sickly.
gs
THE DOCTOR SAID :
' Scott’s Emulsion was a
grand medicine, and would
do my son a lot of good. ’
After the first bottle he was
much brighter, so I con-
tinued, and it has done more
for him than anything ever
did before. He is now ivith-
out an ache or pain, full of
life and energy, and likes Scott’s Emul-
sion so much that he is always eager to
take it. ”
Scott’s Emulsion is an
excellent remedy for weak-
ness of every sort, whatever
its cause. Scott’s Emulsion
is the only emulsion which
has ever received the cordial
approval of the medical
and nursing professions the
world over for building-up
strength. Because of the
CERTAINTY which the
world-wide reputation of
Scott’s Emulsion assures
you, buy Scott’s Emul-
sion in preference to other
emulsions, which do not
offer this guarantee.

NERVE AND BRAIN FOOD.
The only remedy for nervous complaints.
WHY DRUGS AND TONICS FAIL.
The habit of attempting to “whip up” the jaded
nervous system, or to stimulate the flagging and ex-
hausted brain to forced activity, by means of drugs,
medicinal tonics and alcoholic stimulants is one of
the most useless and mischievous practices, calculated
to work infinite harm to brain and nerves by the in-
evitable process of reaction.
Wherever Nervous Disorders exist there is a clear
demand for Nerve and Brain Food —a demand that
can only be met in one way, viz., by supplying the
brain and nerves with the substance by which alone
they can be nourished —in other words, this substance,
Lecithin.
The problem is solved by ANTINEURASTHIN, the
only preparation which presents an efficient percent-
age of active Lecithin unaffected by chemical action
and in an easily assimilable form.

Bert Levy reports a disconcerting experi-
ence at a Melbourne bar, the other day. With
half an eye to the sweet usefulness of adver-
tisement, he broached the subject of black-
and-white art in conversation with the quite
nice’girl who had served, liis nomintoxicant.
She talked 'prettily about Art, and touched
gently upon Culchaw, and presently she
whispered to another Hebe at the other end
of the bar. The other one fetched yet an-
other, and Bert Levy enjoyed the feeling of
one who is being furtively doted on. He
tilted his straw decker, and played the in-
teresting stranger with earnest unconscious-
ness. Then the first girl leaned across the
bar, and murmured: “Excuse me —but aren’t
you Mr. Alf Vincent?” He replied: “No,
bv Heaven! Why this mistake?” And the
damsel confusedly explained : “We knew that
Mr. Vincent was an artist, and we heard he
was very handsome.” Bert, hurt to find that
his own fatal beauty had been scoring under
a false impression, protested that whereas
Vincent also was very handsome, he had
never succeeded in raising a beard. Then he
stuck a cigarette between his silken mo. and
curly chin foliage, and practically slew the
three graces with the best picture pose in his

Bibendum on Tyre Fashions.
As a practical motorist, have you ever been struck by the extraordinary
divergence of opinion which our many competitors exhibit legarding the
correct design for the tread of an all-rubber cover? Look at the adjoining
“ pictures,” taken from issues of various motor papers. It is a
fact that most other t>re companies base their claim upon public affection
because their tvres are manufactured with a special form of tread,
guaranteed to perform all sorts of wonderful feats.
Why?
It would seem that they are trying to please customers much in the
same way as a picture dealer who. in exhibiting a picture set in a showy
frame, diverts the attention of the purchaser from the real object—the
picture itself—by enlarging upon the merits of the frame.
But where does the value lie? In the painting itself or the frame?
The very fact of such a great variety of fancy pattern tyres proves
conclusively that none of these patterns is correct. Either one pattern is
the best, and shuuld be universally adopted by every tyre manufacturer
throughout the world, or all are unnecessary. The only redeeming leature
I can see is that they serve as an advertising point for pushing sales ; in
Which case we must say that the tyre manufacturer has not the interest
of his clients at heart.
He ought not to say : “ Now, here are a few of my assorted patterns.
I haven’t the ghost of a notion which is the best; it is for you to make your
choice.” What he should say is: “I have experimented with all sorts
and shapes of tyres, and this is the model I have found to be the best;
consequently Ido not manufacture any other design. If I did I would be
deceiving you.”
If the grooves on one tread are good, then how can the ribs on
another be equally good ?
And what happens to all those lumps ? At the outset they sppport
the whole weight and bear the driving strain; then, after a time, disgusted
with having so much work put upon them, they quickly disappear.
Result? A plain tread cover.
Again, have you ever compared the thickness of a Michelin Square
Tread with a grooved or fancy pattern cover ? Measured from the bottom
of the grooves there is nearly of an inch less substance than in our
Square Tread; and, in the case of another, if we measure the tread at its
thickest part, we find m/m. as opposed to the 18 m/m. of the Michelin
Square Tread, i.e., T V of an inch less substance.
. You must not be surprised then if they last a shorter time than a
Michelin Square Tread; and yet some of these tyres cost you more than
you would pay for one of our Square Treads. Then, to revert to our
original comparison, why pay more than the picture is worth because of
the ornamental frame ?
Was I not right when I said it was purely a huge piece of advertising
bluff?

HEAD AND FACE
ONE MASS. OF SORES
Was Ashamed to Let Anyone See
Him. Could Have Torn Flesh Off
with Scratching, Suffered 7 Years.
Tried Everything, ‘Cuticura Soap
and Ointment Certainly Cured Me.’
"About seven years ago, I got eczema and
have had it nearly every winter, off and on,
since then. My head and ears, nose, lips and
chin were one mass of sores, and I was
ashamed to let anyone see me.
My head, ears and face broke
out with scabs, and when I
touched them the water ran
from them. I could have torn
the flesh off myself with
scratching.
‘ ‘ I read of the Cuticura treat-
ment in the paper, and I
thought I would try the Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment. I
sent for some and after I had
washed myself two or three
times and applied the Cuticura Ointment,
they eased the itching. I continued with the
Cuticura Soap and Ointment for about three
months, which I found cleared my skin won-
derfully. I had suffered seven years and had
' tried ever so many things all to no advantage,
until I tried the Cuticura Soap and Ointment,
and was entirely cured. They made my skin
soft and beautiful, everything being cleaned
away. My skin is now quite clear, and there
has been no indication of the sores coming
back. I shall be glad for any sufferer from
skin trouble to hear of this, for Cuticura Soap
and Ointment certainly cured me.” (Signed)
Thomas Barry, 10, Reservoir St., Wardley,
Durham, Eng., Jan. 13, 1911.
To go through life tortured and disfigured
by itching, burning, scaly and crusted skin
and scalp humours is unnecessary. For
more than a generation, warm baths with
Cuticura Soap and gentle applications of
Cuticura Ointment have proved successful
in the most distressing cases, of infants,
children and adults, when all else fails.
Cuticura Soap and Ointment are sold through-
out the world. A liberal sample of Cuticura
Ointment, with a 32-page book on the skin

If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“half” will then be seen to have the appearance

only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.

The Inky Way.
“B. de D.”: Queensland Times, whose jubilee
has just been noted (B. 19/10/’ll), has now and
then been guilty of extra-good work in the way of
producing news. One of the best of its efforts was
during the great flood of ’9O. For three days, Bris- j
bane and Ipswich were separated by a torrent miles
wide. The railway was covered for most of the dis-
tance. Several hundred Ipswich people who earned
their crust in Brisbane, had gone there, and been
unable to return; and the telegraph wires were
down, and nobody knew what had happened to the
swamped capital. The Q.T. resolved to find out.
One man was despatched on horseback, with instruc-
tions to get to Brisbane at any cost, if it could be
done within three days. Simultaneously, an open
boat was chartered, and two men and W. Kippen,
one of the proprietors, pushed off. They were all
good swimmers, but this would have been no use if
anything had happened to the boat. They got to
Brisbane after a long fight, and rowed up Edward-
street, to within a yard or two of the Courier office.
There they got all the news, and told the Courier
people how it fared with Ipswich. Then, as they
could not row back against the current, they started
to walk and wade and swim the 30-odd miles, which,
with necessary deviations, stretched to between 40
and 50. Thev set out early on a dark, moist morn-
ing, and landed, a sleepy, slimy, hungry, tattered
party, at 10 o’clock in the night. The stuff was at
once put into type, and by midnight Ipswich knew
what had happened to Brisbane. The horseman went
about 30 miles to the north looking for a north-
east passage to Brisbane, and then, having decided
by rough estimate, that fully 1000 miles would have
to be covered to reach the city per nag, he turned
homewards.

jury tired, and brought in a verdict of ‘not guilty.’ ’’
Of course it meant “retired,” but it got nearer the
truth by the comp.’s method.

“Condot”: In his meandering and interesting par.,
“Scribe” (B. 21/9/’ll) expresses the belief that
No. 1 of the Melbourne Advertiser, published by
Fawkner, is irrecoverably lost. This is not so.
There is one copy in the possession of the descend-
ants of Captain Lonsdale, and an old number of Mel-
bourne Notes and Queries, published by William
Archer, has some extracts from it. James Bonwick,
in “The Discovery and Settlement of Port Phillip,”
issued in ’56, reprints the contents of the first issue
of the Advertiser. It was published on New Year’s
Day, 1838. The first leader begins grandiloquently:
“We do opine that Melbourne cannot reasonably re-
main longer marked on the chart of advancing civili-
sation without its Advertiser. Such being our im-
perial fiat, we do intend, therefore, by means of this,
our Advertiser, to throw the resplendent light of
publicity upon all the affairs of this new colony,
whether of commerce, of agriculture, or of the arts
and mysteries of the grazier. All these patent roads
of wealth are thrown open to the adventurous Port
Phillipians. All these sources of riches are about
(or already are) to become accessible to our ad-
venturous colonists of NOUS.” Fawkner announced
that, until further arrangements could be made; the
paper would be a small advertising sheet, and would
be given away to householders. There is one good
news item drastically reduced: “Report has reached
Melbourne that Cammerfield, the murderer, who was
sent from Sydney to point out where seven men were
said to be murdered, has killed the two constables,
and one soldier who had him in charge, and is now
at large in the bush, well-mounted and armed. A
party of volunteers, we learn, are gone in pursuit.”
There were only nine issues of the Advertiser- in
manuscript, the tenth being in type of varied font.
In the Melbourne Museum is the old wooden press
which Fawkner got from Van Diemen’s Land, where-
with to print his little rag.

“Harrison O.”: An anthology of the hundred worst
Australian poems might include a selection
from Mr. Arthur Bateman’s “Poetical and Dramatic
Works.” Mr. Arthur Bateman at present resides in
the Fog, but he accuses this country of being his
home. His “Works,” which were lately published,
include a bush epic, “Reuben and Violet” ; and be-
fore the female partner rides off, her: female parent
addresses her thus-
“ ‘To-morrow,’ said the mother, ‘you may go,
But not to-night, there is no fear, I know ;
I am not afraid of any girlish wrong,
You are not now a child, so go along—
Select your dresses and your underwear,
And I will send them on by carrier.’ ”
Douglas Sladen couldn’t do better than that even if
he tried another poem on the virtues of condensed
milk.

“Galleryite”: When the Postal Rates Bill was be-
fore the House of Reps, a strong fight was put up
on behalf of the Australian writer and Australian
printer. Jo. Thomas made one of his last blunders
as P.M.G. when he framed this Bill. He allowed
the 4d. per Boz. concession on reviews and maga-
zines, etc., printed and published in the Common-
wealth, but he discounted this by saying nothing at
all about the publications printed from stereo, blocks
made in England and America. This, of course,
made the concession apply to printing from foreign-
made stereo, blocks. Fenton moved an amendment
to provide that the publications to which the con-
cession should apply must be “wholly set up” in
Australia. Jo replied that, in the interests of the
magazines and the reading public, he could not ac-
cept the amendment. Spence, Higgs, and others who
know something about the Black Art, tackled him,
and, finally, Thomas, seeing that defeat was inevit-
able, accepted the amendment, and it was put through
on the voices.

“Orient”: I again appeal, as I did before the
Chinese revolution broke out, for direct telegraphic
communication with China and Japan. It is absurd
for us to take the English estimate of the value of
news from “the East,” which is our North. Here
we are dosed every day with a long screed about the
unpleasantness in Tripoli, comparative tripe to us.
We want, or ought to want, very full intelligence
from China. Positively, our cablegram suppliers re-
gard it of less importance than doings in London’s
aristocratic back kitchens. Keep your globe with
Australia on top, and see who are our neighbors;
and then let us have our news accordingly.

For real hustling helter-skelter, there is nothing
in Australia to compare with the London Gazette,
the official organ of King George and the Imperial
Government. On September 27 it came out with a
“special supplement” of 44 pages, containing a full,
true and particular account of the Coronation—just
three months after the expensive fiasco.
* * * *
“Motley and Tinsel,” a serial which started in
Lloyd’s Weekly News, was withdrawn after the
first few chapters had been printed, because an actor
owning the same name as one of the characters con-
sidered himself libelled, and a generous jury gave
him £2OO damages. The authoress, a lady named
Prothero, has now published the story in a book,
with the names of the characters changed to G. B.
Shaw, G. R. Sims, Barry Pain, Robert Barr, W.
Pett Ridge, and Chesterton. They aU consented to
the sacrilege in order to try to show this particular
law what an ass of a law it is, and to explain to it
that a better statute could be made out of cat’s
meat.

“Bookware: Stevenson, while in Sydney, published
his shilling book on Father Damien. The present
value of an original copy is £25. Talking of col-
lectors, American millionaires rushed up the prices
amazingly at an auction of the collection of one
Huth, in London, a few weeks ago. Some of the
biggest prices were paid for literary relics which
Huth bought the cheapest. A letter by Bums, which
brought £490, cost £l2; a letter by Fielding,
£lOl5, cost £l2; letter to Johnson by Goldsmith,
£280; by Defoe, £245; by Anne Boleyn, £315;
by Queen Elizabeth, £365; by Catherine of Arra-
gon, £800;, by Mary Queen of Scots, £1025 (Huth
gave £2 for this). A letter by Wesley fetched only
£10; one by Luther, £495; and another by Mo-
zart, £B2. Yet this last script was one of the most
interesting of all; it told how Fraulein Weber’s
father had forbidden Mozart the house. He married
her, all the same.


The Last Chance
of buying the new Encyclopaedia Britannica at the minimum price is
offered to=day to readers of the “Bulletin.” The annexed order form
must be posted on or before Saturday, December 9, to the Press of the
University of Cambridge (England). To save time it may be sent to
the Australian office, 9 Bridge=street, Sydney, where the various
bindings may be inspected. The price will be raised at midnight
and the increase will be permanent. To-day the minimum price of
15s. lOd. per volume is still in force, and a single payment of one
guinea will bring you the 29 volumes, the balance being payable by
monthly instalments (see order form). But to secure these minimum
terms the order must absolutely bear a post=mark not later than
DECEMBER 9.
Opinions of Australian Buyers.
From the Hon. A. A. Davey, M.L.C.
“The Encyclopaedia Britannica contains
a wealth of authoritative and up-to-date
information on, apparently, every subject
of human interest. The arrangement of
matter leaves nothing to be desired ; it
is adapted to the requirements of the busy
man. The wisdom of the world is boiled
down, yet presented without undue restric-
tion of necessary detail ; it is a, library in
itself. The light India paper bound in the
flexible covers, with the beautifully clear
type, makes the handling of the volumes a
pleasure.’’
From Mr. Jas. Allan, M.L.A., Governing
Director of Messrs. Allan and Stark, Ltd..
“ I am fully satisfied. The Encyclo-
paedia is a mine of wealth —-containing an
abundant supply of the latest discoveries
and general knowledge—a great storage
of power.”
From Dr. R. Hamlyn Harris, Director of
the Queensland Museum.
“As regards my opinion of the 11th
Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica,
very little need be said, because it is a
work which speaks for itself, and is too
well-known and too highly appreciated
throughout the whole world to need any
eulogistic terms applied to it. It is like a
light in a dark place, casting its rays into
the innermost recesses of the mind.”
From Mr. J. G. Reimann, Elder Conserva-
torium of Music, Adelaide.
“ Although the prospectus caused one
to expect a great deal, I feel that the
work fulfils more than is foreshadowed)' in
the prospectus. lam very much strjick
with the ample treatment Music as an;art
receives, and with the splendid paragraphs
devoted to the various instruments (or-
chestral-and otherwise), and the excellent
diagrams and illustrations provided in
each case.”
From His Honor Judge Heydon, Judge of
the Industrial Court.
“ I wish to express to you the great
pleasure which I derive from my new En-
cyclopaedia Britannica. For reference it
is most satisfactory, and for reading it is
delightful. It is really wonderful that
such an immense mass of information
should be conveyed in so interesting a
way, packed in so small and convenient a
space, and obtainable, at what seems to me
so reasonable a price. I look at it every
day with increased satisfaction.”
From Mr. Thomas Fraser, Civil Engineer,
North Sydney.
“ The Encyclopaedia Britannica is an
invaluable work of reference to all, es-
pecially to those whose work lies in the
region of the applied sciences, and I cannot
imagine how any professional man can do
without it. To my mind the greatest
feature of all in the last edition, the 11th,
is the fact that all the volumes are prac-
tically up-to-date, and that means that it
is worth more than many libraries to those
who are engaged in the profession of engin-
eering, or any of its numerous branches.”
From Mr. H. R. Treatt, Accountant,
Cobar.
“I have read every page of the prospec-
tus with interest, and was thus constrained
to have the complete set. I have already
gotten about £3 or £ 4 worth of inform-
ation therefrom, viz:. ‘Hydraulics’ and
‘ Weirs.’ ”
From Mr. M. A. Martin, General Manager,
Haymarket Permanent Land, Building,
and Investment Co., Sydney-
“ I find it replete with reliable informa-
tion condensed and clarified by competent
authorities. The India paper and flexible
binding are a great advance on any: previ-
ous work of reference.”

IN BANANA LAND
When Minister Paget visited Taroom, four
blushing damsels interviewed him, and told
him they simply would not get married until
they could take their honeymoon trip by
rail. Evidently Paget took the matter to
heart, for he turned the first sod of the
Taroom branch a week later, and received a
wire from the exulting quartette: “Prepar-
ing trousseaux. Best thanks !” The Denham
crowd evidently now includes “inducements
to matrimony” as a legitimate object for
loan expenditure.
Government Printer Cumming has, in
about two years, transformed the State
Printing Office into a live, up-to-date con-
cern, doing all the Government work, and
earning about 12i per cent, on capital in-
vested. In times past, the office was a deadly
example of doddering incapacity; and Pri-
vate Enterprise is so annoyed at the change ,
that it waited on the Treasurer, the other
day, and implored him to. suppress somebody.
“The Government Printing Office,” said
Barnes, “is now a hive of industry!” “That
is just what we complain about!” replied
the deputation indignantly. Had Barnes
given the deputation any encouragement,
Bullocky Bill had arranged to drop in with a
protest against the railways, which inter-
fered with his business, and he proposed to
implore the Government to suppress Com-
missioner Evans, and let the enterprise just
run itself.
Minister Macartney, proposes to deal legis-
latively with that thorny question, the leas-
ing of State lands to aliens. But a bigger
trouble in N.Q. is the leasing of private
lands to the Asiatic. North Queensland is
a brain-racking anomaly. It leases its acres,
to the Chow, patronises the Jap. laundry,
deals with Chinese bakers, and yet sends
Labor men to Parliament. And the West is.
the same. In Hughenden, some years ago,?
stood a sign :
J. DRURY,
WHITE MAN,
BAKER.
In the heart of the most radical Labor con-
stituency in Queensland, a tradesman found
it necessary to advertise that he was not a
Chinaman. The Chinese bakers, however,
went on flourishing—on the custom of
Labor men’s wives.

E. Pugh, who came to Bananaland as tar
back as ISSB. His brother, Theophilus, was
well-known on Brisbane’s Inky Way halt a
century ago, and another brother, .Thomas,
was for years sub-editor of the Melbourne
Argus. Theophilus was the founder of
“Pugh’s Queensland Almanac,” which cele-
brated its 50th anniversary a year or so ago.
Deceased was in the Bananaland Public Ser-
vice for many years, but, of late, had been

“Don Q.”: Some details of importance
were overlooked by the writer of a recent
Bulletin paragraph concerning our now
somewhat famous Belmont tramway, muddle.
For instance, the Railway Commissioner, m
the first place, reported dead against the pro-
posed line. Also, the Phidston Government,
when in power, refused to advance the Bel-
m'ont Council any money for the line; but
per medium of Minister Barnes, a loan was
eventually fixed up. Then, Splash went
£l2 000, Swish followed £5OOO, a few weeks
later Bang went £2OOO, and the contraption
isn’t running yet. Things must be pretty
hot when even Barnes starts to. denounce the
precious Belmont Council, which is in liis

own constituency. He asked it some very
nasty questions when it weighed in for the
last £2OOO, particularly as to how it came
to sink £lBOO on a locomotive when a £l2OO
engine, built at the Ipswich railway work-
shops, could do better work. Also, he ex-
pressed a wish to have the council’s engineer,
in a 24ft. ring for 30min. The council
pleaded that it had relied entirely upon its
engineer, who was an outside consulting en-
gineer, and, although he was repeatedly re-
quested to turn up and explain things, he
failed to materialise. Belmont might have
learnt a lesson from the mess Rockhampton
made of its tin-can tram system. Even the
French engineer, brought out specially to
run the ■ rocky contraption known as the
Purry Steam Motor, is throwing up the
sponge at the end of the year. But there are
tons of things you can’t teach a tuppenny
local council, and the chief of these is sense.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The wind that sweeps from the deeps untold,
It pipes i’ the spray, and the birds give answer ;
The magpie’s voice is a flute of gold,
And the light twig trips as a fairy dancer;
The clouds that scud on a silv’ry wing,
Call out, “Come on!” to the wand’rer gay,
And the pulses beat and the heart doth sing—
“lf J<?y Will fiddle, then I will pay!”
The bulrush bends o’er the blue lagoon,
And the ripples laugh like a gay deceiver ;
The wild-fowl skim in the sunshine boon,
And the hawk that swoops is a festive reiver;
There’s a song i’ the grass and a song 1’ the tree,
And a song i’ the breast when the breezes play,
And the scrub-tops rustle tumultuously—
“lf Joy will fiddle, then I will pay!”
I take no stock i’ the grimy town,
Its grim, grey walls, and its highways dusty;
I care no whit for the flaunting gown,
For the toiling brain and the heart so rusty ;
Its puling saint and its peddling sin
May chop and change in the ancient way—
They touch me not. When the light laughs in,
“If Jpy will fiddle, then I will pay !”
What else remains if the day should rise
In a radiant sweep of rose-lit splendor?
And the bush is reft of her dark disguise,
And bathed in lines of a dawning tender ?
What else is left when the bell-birds clear
Peal out the notes that the scrubs embay ?
And the cups are full i’ the bursting year?
If Joy will fiddle, then I will pay!
QUEENSLAND.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, November -25, 1911.
My Dear Tiiargomindah,—
The latest vice-regal interest centres
around Muckadilla, where his Scotchellency
has recently been "taking the waters,” as a
cure for those twinges of rheumatism which
fall indiscriminately on the just and those
whose characters won’t stand inspection. On
the occasion of the last assault, the Chieftain
packed up his portsammy, his A. Decamp,
the Government Analyst, and his (the Mac-
gregor’s) missus, and bolted for the place
where the antidote rises out of the earth.
The short stay in the West was brightened
by a visit to Eurella station, where the
hospitable Donald Fletchers did their best to
riemove the taste of the Muckadilla brand.
News reaches me from Lloyd Georgeville
of the marriage of Miss Hore, a sister of the
rector of Beaudesert, who recently tripped to
England with his tall and fair other half.
Miss Hore came to Brisbane to attend her
brother’s wedding, when Lord Chelmsford
deliberately gave away the bride. She was
a personal pal of his lady’s, and the very
exclusive few bidden twirled the platter at
the old Government shack. The Hore bride-
groom, also, is a parson, and the presents
included a picture from Princess Alexander
of Teck. The exact kind of picture wasn t
mentioned.
Lieut.-Col. Chauvel and his pretty girl
wife and wee sons leave to-day for MeL
bourne. Mrs. Chauvel has just recovered
from a severe attack of pneumonia, so severe
that, for a time, her life was despaired. So
it is a shadowy beauty we are forwarding, but
the cargo of good wishes which accompany
the lady will help to ballast the steamer.
The Lieut.-Col. was farewelled on Friday
night, by fellow officers of the United Ser-
vice, at 'the club rooms. On the same occa-
sion, the other barrel of the gun was loaded
with good wishes, and fired at Lieut. Roland
Bowen, of the naval forces, who has been
ordered to move on to Thursday Island. The
Lieut, will be greatly missed in social circles,
for he was an expert squire ofj, dames and a
good dancing man, two virtues .in these days,
my dear, second to none but riches.
Mrs. Jopp, by way of doing honor to her
daughter (Mrs. Chauvel), tea’d a surfeited
plutocracy on Thursday, being aided and
abetted by another daughter, Dora, who will
shortly fly south for the rest of the summer.
Anyhow, that is what she said. My own
opinion is that we’ve got it all up here.
The wedding of Robt. Corachie and Miss
Vida Harley, on Wednesday, united two 9f
our comtnercial houses. Harley, sen., is
one of the foremost members of the
Ancient Order of Enslaved Bricklayers, and
has lived so long at Norman Park and East
Brisbane* that he remembers when a tame
goat could have leaped over the State debt,
whereas now nothing but a wild aeroplane
could manage it. The bride is a stately
girl, with a very fair share of the family
looks. There were the usual orange blos-
soms, bridesmaids, relatives and other appur-
tenances which go to make up the complete
wedding. Next week, another knot-tying will
engage general attention. In this suit one
of the pretty O’Hagan sisters, a niece of the
late “Dinny” Keogh, will appear as the
plaintiff, and Crown-Solicit-or Tom McCawley
as the defendant. Costs will be on the
highest scale.
With the Mawson expedition goes Leslie
Blake, a peg in the Queensland Government
Survey Department. Although he is not
very ancient, being less than 30 years of age,
he has had plenty of experience, and won t
be found least of the brains of the party
when it gets to work in the old planet s ice-
chest.
The Woman’s Club, under the presidency
of Mrs. Telegraph Lewis, has had a suc-
cessful and almost strenuous year. Papers
with an educative aim have been gravely dis-
cussed, and, for aught I know, much good
has resulted. Personally, I always arrive in
time for the coffee —they make it well, and
ladle it unsparingly —but on Thursday
evening, as there was no educative or other
ulterior dullness afoot, I went bright and
early, and joined m the revels.
A flutter of quite unusual poundage and
dimensions has been caused by a whisper re
the engagement of the widow of a wealthy
pastoralist to a politician whose legal learn-
ing and raven locks are the envy and admir-
ation of the ladies’ gallery. Every refreshery
in the city buzzes with excitement, particu-
larly because, last year, the self-same raven-
locked politician, according to that old un-
reliable gossip, Rumor, was liable to wed
the widow’s daughter.
Cupid took advantage of that Wool-
cock-Williams wedding last week, to do
a little work in the vicinity, as a result of
which Titian-haired Winnie Benbow, who
returned a few months ago from Fogland,
has promised to adopt the name discarded
by the bride. Herbert Williams is the man,
but he doesn’t seem down-hearted.
For once in a way, we have been given a
new show before it appeared in your city—
even though it was put on as a memory test.
The play was “Inconstant George,” by the
Plimmer-Denniston co. The night I was
there the house saw the. subtle French whim-
sicalities as through a smoked glass, darkly:
but everybody could see and admire the glad
rags with which the feminines of the co.
arrayed themselves.
Died, on Wednesday morning, Mrs. J. D.
Henry, formerly Mabel Sinclair, whose wed-
ding ring had hardly had time to adapt itself
to her finger. A fall from a balcony three
years ago in Hobart was the long-postponed
cause of death. The unfortunate lady, who
was a clever musician and a keen tennis
player, was on the point of leaving for her
new home at Cloncurry, when the oldest
home of all opened its door to her.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Queensland’s big labor prison at St. Hel-
ena jumped with excitement the other day.
Two prisoners had escaped. The place was
turned upside dowm. Guards were set, and
the neighborhood was searched. As two days
went by, the stranger in the distant places of
the State had the cold eye of suspicion
turned on him by the Law. Policemen
moved up mysteriously to street corners, and
peered doWn into the hazy distances. Then
some genius thought to look under a table in
a shed in the gaol—and found the missing
circumstances. Whereupon the evening
paper’s Great Sensation dropped dead.
! Mackay, where the rum comes from, has
been staring pop-eyed at a cannon which is
believed to have belonged to Captain Cook’s
ship Endeavor. It is sft. long, and 12in. in
diameter at the breech, is of a hexagonal
shape at the muzzle; and. is inscribed with
the letters “G.R.,” a crown and the figure 3.
It had been used, for nobody knows how long,
as ballast in the ketch Dart. The Dart was
bought by a white man from some Japanese,
who alleged that the Binghis had found their
aged cannon on a reef, near Cooktown. If
it ever was Cook’s, he no doubt jettisoned it
when his vessel ran on the Barrier Reef, near
the mouth of the Endeavor .River.

Extract of a letter
from the late Manager,
“Motor Transit Com-
pany of Australia,”
Glen Innes: “During
the time I was manag-
ing ‘The Motor Transit
Co. of Australia,’ we
had plying between ~ , ,
Glen Innes and Inverell an 11-16 Clement-Bayard Car, which we purchased as second-
hand. We did about. 60,000 miles with her up to the time of my leaving (she is still going
well). Nearly all the running was done between Glen Innes and Inverell, over the famous
Waterloo Range, some of the grades of which are one in six. The Car was invariably
overloaded, and was given very little care; but in the face Of the bad usage she received
at our hands she stood up wonderfully well, and the only repairs that were effected
were two ball races for road wheels and a set of new valves.” Call and allow us to
explain the reason why our prices for Cars generally, Commercial Lorries and High-
wheel Buggies will be found to be 25 per cent, lower than the usual Sydney quotations.

Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its splendid
healing power. Sufferers from Bronchitis, Cough, Croup, Asthma,
Hoarseness, Difficulty of Breathing, Pain or Soreness in the che£t,
experience delightful and rapid relief, and to those who are subject
to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure.
It is most comforting in allaying Irritation in the Throat and giving
Strength to the Voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to
become chronic nor Consumption to develop. Consumption is not
known where “ Coughs ” have, on their first appearance, been
properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without
it, as taken at the beginning, a dose or two is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.

Shotgun Cartridge
“NEW R IVAL»
Made in America by Experts.
The effectiveness of your gun is enhanced by using good
cartridges in it. If you have not used “New Rival” car-
tridges, do so next time you go shooting and you will then
understand why they are sold in such large quantities.
These cartridges are made in America, where there is more
shooting done with the shotgun than in any other country.
They cost more than other makes, because they are worth
more; and they are worth much more to you than the
slight difference in price. Every shot counts when “ New
Rival” cartridges are used, and you realize your fulljskill.
SOLD BY DEALERS EVERYWHERE.
ICILMA SHAMPOOS.
TOO MUCH or TOO LITTLE washing ruins the hair. The ICILMA shampoos allow
you to clean the hair WITH OR WITHOUT WETTING, just as your hair needs it
—a wet shampoo with ICILMA SHAMPOO SACHETS every two or three weeks,
and a dry shampoo with ICILMA HAIR POWDER whenever the hair is dull, dusty or
greasy, and wetting is inconvenient. Both ICILMA shampoos contain the wonderful
ICILMA elements which benefit and beautify the hair. ' ■ ■ -- ■

Nine men out of every ten in the Mel-
bourne Tramway Co.’s uniform now carry
on their watch chains a little gilt badge. A
few months ago, the wearer of such an
article would have been incontinently
“fired.” For it is the union medal of the
Australian Tramvcay Employees’ Associa-
tion, and a species of defiance to the forces
of monopoly—a symbol of the fact that its
owner has the power behind him to secure a
decent wage. Some day 90 per cent, of the
selerks will number a union badge among
their belongings; but not just yet. And,
meanwhile, their wages are going to remain
bad—aye, putrid.
Britain has been steadily widening its
property franchise for years, till at last it
seemed as if a time might come when every-
body who owned two chairs and a pair of
hoots would have a vote. Now, by way
of a complete novelty, adult suffrage with-
out property qualification is spoken of. It:
is amazing how the Cold Land has lagged
behind in this simple matter. Forty years
ago, the South American republic of Colom-
bia not only had manhood suffrage; it had
gone further, and had so far recognised
the equality of man as to enact that “all
Colombians over the age of 21 shall be con-
sidered as generals of the republic.”

‘HE good name of the mother country is
bound up in AVON MOTOE TYRES.
The home folk who run their cars on
AVONS are not looking any more for the per-
fect tyre, because the manufacture of AVONS,
always at the top notch of modernity, is conducted on the
principle that not the most scientific machinery can make silk
purses out of sows’ ears; that the strength, endurance and
speediness demanded of the motor tyre must be derived from
material of the finest, deftly handled.

Valves, Hose, etc., specially adapted for use in the tropics. Contrac-
tors to the principal State Railways.

WHY YOD CAN TRUST MY
FREE CIGAR
TRIAL
■ I
£Z4A/Y\ t
ALMOST everybody knows about my eflorts
to make Cigar-smoking popular in Aus-
tralia.
My FREE CIGAR TRIAL is this:—l’ll send
you a box of 100 DIADEMAS for 22/6 —equal, as
they are, to any 6d. Cigar on the market; really
worth £2 ss. per 100 —and you can smoke 5 or 6
of them. If they aren’t as good as any Cigar
you have ever tried, send the remainder back to
me, and I’ll refund your money in full, without
any charge for those you've smoked.
dsf
Now, I want to prove to
you how straight this offer is.
You might think—“ Why
doesn’t he send the box up
without any money, and let
us send the money on when
we’ve tried the 5 or 6 and
found them as good as he
says, or else return the
balance then ?”
I tell you right off, I’d like
to do that. But that would
put all the trusting on my
side —and I've got to make a
living.
I know nearly every man-
jack ofyou would act straight
tb me if I did make this offer.
But you know as well as I
there are some who would
get the Cigars, and let me
whistle for the money.
I know there’d be only a
few who would do this; but
I sell my Cigars so close to
cost—cutting off all the ware-
houseman’s, traveller’s and
retailer’s profits—that these
few would cripple my scheme
altogether. That's why I
can’t do it and give the same
Cigar value as I give to-day.
I know you’re trusting me
in sending down the money
before you get the Cigars.
But you’ll get the Cigars
right by return post, never
fear. You can smoke sor 6
of them, and if they’re not
as good as you expected,
you can send what are left
right back. I’ll return your money —every
penny of it, with no deduction whatever—
and even here you needn’t only take my word
for it.
I have my banking account at the Com-
mercial Bank of Australia Limited, Melbourne.
The General Manager there knows all about
me and my way of doing business. He’ll vouch
for me; and you can refer to him before you
send any order at all to me. 'that's proof of my
squareness, isn’t it?
Sit down now and send me 22/6 to-day, and
I'll forward you a box of 100 DIADEMAS—
Cigars that I promise are equal to any 6d.
Cigar sold in Australia—made from clean, long,
straight Brazilian leaf, and rolled in the finest
Java wrapper.

BILIOUS SUBJECTS
are generally victims of Constipation, that root evil of so many
terrible afflictions ; but they are “ bilious subjects ” no longer when
they adopt the famous Cockle’s Antibilious Pills as the standing
household remedy, now in the
Second Century of World-Wide Renown.
Cockle’s Pills, which doctors of six generations have taught the world
to use and esteem, have no harsh, coercive action on the sluggish orgac:;
they gently stimulate, soothingly strengthen and encourage, the natural
organic functions, at the same time thoroughly cleansing the system and
purifying the vital fluid. There is nothing to equal Cockle’s Pills for
this perfect cleansing, reinvigorating, purifying combination of results.
It is marvellous.

10 YEARS OF
sfdg
HEART AFFECTED, AND BREATHING WAS DIFFICULT.
SISTER AND BROTHER RESCUED
fsg
MRS. INGRAM, who tells
of the health - restoring
powers of Bile Beans.
BY BILE BEANS
“ about 10 years 1 was subject to acute
I * attacks of indigestion which pros=
trated me for days together,” says
Mrs. M. Ingram, of Crown St., Woolloon=
gabba, South Brisbane. “Violent headaches,
dizziness and pains in the back caused me
awful agony. Palpitation alarmed me very
much. Breathing at times was a difficulty,
and I felt as if I was suffocating. Biliousness
also attacked me, and altogether 1 was in a
terrible plight. When 1 had almost given up
in despair I commenced taking Bile Beans on
the advice of my brother. In a short time
this splendid medicine gave me ease, for the
pains were quickly relieved, all flatulence
banished, and the awful sensations round my
heart gradually disappeared. By continuing
with Bile Beans 1 was able to eat with
comfort, my Liver was strengthened and I felt better in every way. After
a full course of Bile Beans 1 had a complete return to health, and no longer
did I feel despondent or weary. I have much faith in Bile Beans, for they
cured me in a wonderful manner.
“My brother, referred to above, became very much rundown and soon
was a martyr to debility. Commencing to take Bile Beans, he was glad to
find that the first few doses brought much relief, and by persevering with the
splendid medicine he was soon completely cured, and now enjoys the
best of health.”
Bile Beans are un-
equalled 'For headache,
indigestion, constipa-
tion, biliousness, bad
breath, debility, that
tired Feeling, lassitude,
lack ofenergy, anaemia
and female ailments.

Annual
THE Annual of 19x1 is the twenty-first issue, and is better
than any of its predecessors—indeed, an unexampled
production. It is on similar lines to the last, which met
with such extraordinary popularity with the public, and will
comprise .
SIX intensely interesting and
attractive Stories
from the pens of eminent living writers, including George
R. Simms, Max Pemberton, W. Pett Ridge, Dick
Donovan, Fergus Hume, F. T. Bullen, each specially
written for this Annual ; and, as usual, the tales will be
beautifully and extensively illustrated, among the artists
being Frank Dadd, J. C. Dollman, Harry Furniss,
Will Owen, Charles Pears, R. Caton Woodville.
The entirely new feature commenced last year has again
been introduced, viz. :
FOUR Full Pages of an Illus-
trated Song, in Colours,
facsimiles ot the Original Water Colour Drawings, depicting
in the most artistic manner the descriptive verses of the
famous old humorous Devonshire song, “Un r le Tom
Cobleigh.” These special pages are a most diverting
innovation. The Annual will be, as usual, accompanied by
3

A Bag of Tools.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IHAD watched the pomp and glory as
the King went proudly by,
And I saw the braid and tinsel with a
cold unfeeling eye.
For a man with weighted shoulder trudged
obscurely through the crowd —
Aye, he bore the saw and hammer whilst
they cheered full long and loud!
And I said : “i/e bears the sceptre, though
the crown be on the brow
Of the person ornamental whom the fools
are cheering now!”
He is truly King and Ruler —what can
pomp and tinsel do?
But the workman is the Master who shall
shape the world anew !
With the axe and saw and hammer, with the
pick and spade and bar
Rules the Workman o’er creation, and the
cities builded are!
Vain indeed are braid and tinsel, but with
chisel, drill and plane
He hath raised the nations truly, and shall
raise them yet again !
And the tools upon his shoulder are a symbol
that I know —
Kings and Queens may have the glory, but
HE makes the Empires grow!
Crowds mav shout and men may maffick
when the King and crown they view ;
But the Workman is the Master who shall
build the world anew !
Ye who seek the world’s salvation where the
Kings and Princes are—
Ye who hail the mighty leaders and the
Talkers near and far ;
Put your trust upon the' Master who is
clearly King indeed —
Will ye leave the certain refuge for the frail
and broken reed?
For the Man Beneath the Tool-Bag makes
the world’s achievements glow,
And the King and all his glory are not
worth a hammer’s blow!
Who can work and who can labor?—here is
earth’s salvation true ;
For the Workman is the Master who shall
raise the world anew !
Kings have passed, and their successors bear
the sceptre and the crown ;
But-the world without the Workman owneth
neither ship nor town !
For the Man Behind the Anvil puts the
fleets upon the sea;
And the King who cannot labor wins no
stirring hail from me !
Fools may cheer the pomp and splendor, lift
their plaudits long and loud ;
But mv heart is with tne Workman trudging
nameless through the crowd!
He it is whose hand puissant brings the
Nation safely through—
Aye, the Workman is the Master who must
form the world anew !
Ye who watch the pomp and glory, see the
Truest King go by—
He whose hand is to the labor—ye have
housed him in a sty!
’Tis the man with weighted shoulder who
deserveth best the crown;
But ye give him scantest pittance though he
buildeth ship and town !
He who bears the saw and hammer wins no
plaudits from the crowd ;
But I say he builds the Nation while the
King prepares its shroud !
He is truly Lord and Ruler — though his
wage he hitter rue,
Still the Workman is the Master who shall
shape the loorld anew!

Farm Life in Northern Jungles.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THEY were men of grit and stamina
who first faced the jungles of northern
New South Wales, when there were
no steamers or railways to carry off their
produce, and the wild tribes that flourished
everywhere in the neighborhood added a
strong flavor of danger to the enterprise.
Time was, when one could ride from sun-
rise to sunset on the Richmond and Tweed
rivers and never see a fence, where now
swing gates and painted, homesteads meet
him on every hand. Vast forests, where the
bellbird’s note and the coo of the pigeons
resounded, have given place to waving fields
of corn and cane. Macadamised roads cross
and re-cross each other where only an odd
cattle pad guided us a few years ago; and
bridges span the creeks and gullies where
our bullock teams were bogged, and we rode
up to the saddle-flaps through mud and
slush. One teamster “corduroyed” a bog on
the Tatham-road with smothered bullocks.
The leaders turned when the waggon had
sunk up to the bed, and, getting entangled,
were buried and smothered before they could
be released. At another place, where a
bush bridge, made of rough logs, spanned the
high banks of a creek, a teamster was cross-
ing when his leaders swung round and went
over. The whole team was dragged down,
and more than half of them were drowned in
the deep water, many of them huddled under
the wrecked waggon. It was no uncommon
thing either to have to ride through several
miles of' 1 mud and water on the main roads,
and that' within sight of what are now large
towns. The struggling farmer, in want of a
few shillings, had often to battle through it
with a slideload of pigs, potatoes or corn,
wading bare-footed alongside his team, and
now and again hanging on to the side of his
inelegant conveyance to readjust its equil-
ibrium, or frantically poking up his live
stock when the water rushed in and threat-
ened to drown them.
The farm that, didn’t make our fortunes
was let, like a good many others, rent-free
by- the station for the sake of having it
cleared. A rough, two-roomed house, with
walls of split slabs, earthen floor and a
shingle roof, was the first improvement. A
fence across the bight, enclosing part of the
scrub, followed months lafer. Timber was
plentiful, but farmers built sparingly in
those days, being content with the roughest
habitations imaginable. Boors were made of
split pine palings, having plenty of daylight
over the top; shutters of the same material;
both being fastened with wooden pegs,
which, when not in use, hung to the door-
post by a strip of hide or a piece of cord.
Beds were also made of pine battens. Some
of the more fastidious settlers went in for
spring mattresses —made of round timber
and fencing wire. Chairs were unknown,
the universal seats being rough stools, made
with, a slab and four round legs. A couple
of sawn blocks stood by the fireside, and
there the Old Man smoked his evening pipe,
and told yarns of the blacks and the gold-
fields, intermixed with sundry reminiscences
of the “Old Dart.”
Saturday was a busy day—for me. There
was the cask to fill—with buckets of water
carried from the river up a bank 300yds.
from top to bottom. It was a sort of fatigue
duty; it fatigued me, anyway. And there
was an armful of tea-tree bush to get from
the One-Mile - Swamp, to make the new
broom with. These brooms were about Oft.
in circumference, with a young sapling-
thrust through the centre for handle. With
care, they lasted a whole week. By that
time the leaves had died, and were easily
broken off, so that the broom left more litter
behind than it swept before it.
Sunday morning was generally spent in
shooting around the swamps and lagoons.
Occasionally, we all walked down to the next
farm, five miles distant. None of us kept
carriages at this time. On the following
Sunday our neighbor and his wife, followed
by half a dozen bare-legged children and
three or four dogs, would return the visit.
It was in this way we kept some sort of
grip on civilisation. We also had a neigh-
bor some miles above us. He came down
occasionally at night-time to play cards—
when there was no husking to do; and Uncle
would return the visit the following week,
plodding home somewhere about midnight.
The loneliness of that place is with me
yet. The distant ring of the axe, and the
peculiar cry of the cat-bird, gave it an im-
pressiveness of its own. The scrub began
within a few yards of the door, growing-
thicker and darker as it extended into the
bight. The first work was to clear the un-
dergrowth and vines with brush-hooks. All
the small growth is brushed in the jungle,
low branches are lopped, the vines that twine
into the tops and lace the trees together are
cut at the roots, and severed where they
cross the ground. These include the tena-
cious lawyer-vines, that cling- like tiger’s
claws to anything that touches them. Thous-
ands of little hooks and needle points wait
for the slightest contact of the unwary, tear-
ing the clothes to ribbons, and lacerating
hands and arms. Thorns and stinging trees,
myriads of mosquitoes .and hordes of leeches,
help the lawyer-vines to make the work in-
teresting. Enveloped in deep gloom, the
pioneer clears the way steadily into the
heart of the jungle, while the startled wal-
labies bound over the decaying leaves, and a
thousand scrub birds call to him from the
tree tops. The brushing is about the easiest
part of the work. It is clean and light,
'though subject to many annoyances. When
it is done, one can walk comfortably through
the scrub, and the way is clear for the swing
of the axe.
Felling the scrub is slow and laborious
work, and at times attended with consider-
able risk. The small trees are merely
nicked, the larger ones are cut partly
through. Perhaps half an acre or more will
be done like this ; then a big tree is cut down
and carries the lot crashing to earth in one
tangled mass. Trees beyond the boundaries
of the axeman’s operations are torn and
broken also by the far-reaching tentacles
that hold -them, branches tumble down in
showers, and vines snap and recoil with a
vicious swing. The axeman starts to run
for safe ground as soon as his giant begins
to sway, and thence till the cracking ceases
he watches the tree tops around him with
quick and ever shifting glances. He never
knows, in a vine-bound jungle, whence a
limb might • come. Half-dazed ’possums
scramble from the wreck, the squeaking of
young birds is heard, and broken nests and
eggs are everywhere. Here and there, per-
haps, a stripped trunk will be left standing,
or a small, tough sapling bending over the
mass of greenery. These take some trouble
to reach before they can be cut down. Then
another patch is commenced, and so he goes
on till 10 or 20 acres are down. This has
to remain a long while to dry, and, in the
meantime, he works in some other quarter
of the scrub, so that there will be a green
wall between the two patches when the first
is dry enough to burn. The very look of
that huge patch drying in the sun is encour-
aging to the new settler, and he works
harder than ever on the next.
Very little of the big timber is consumed
in the first burning-off, and the blackened
logs lie thickly across each other all over
the ground. A road is cut down the centre,
wide enough for a dray to pass through when
the time comes to bring in the crop. Cross-
cutting the huge, black logs and levering
them aside is heavy work, and takes weeks
to accomplish.
Then the crop is put in. A bucket of seed
is soaking on the road, and, with a bag-
pouchful in front of him, and a long narrow-
bladed hoe, the farmer starts along his first
row, running it as straight as possible from
road to river, digging the hoe in at every
stride, and dropping four grains behind it so
that the earth will drop back. Only about
half the ground is thus planted the first
year, the other half being covered with tim-
ber, over which he climbs all day, finishing
at night as black as a chimney sweep. His
rows are usually as straight as were those
of the new-chum hand who steered for the
brindle cow that was feeding along on the
outside of the field. Still, corn grows as
well in a crooked row as in a straight one.
They had heroic hearts, those early farm-
ers, to face the prodigious pioneering work
that confronted them on every side. They
were unconventional people, for the most
part. So much so were some of them, that I
have seen men dressed in pants of sugee-
bag, and shirts made of flour bags, the
brand in broad letters still visible across the
back, in cases where it could not be hidden
conveniently on the tail. Hats were home-
made, cabbage-tree and calico forming the
principal material. As for boots, one mem-
ber of the family wore them regularly—-the
Old Man; and his clod-squashers were
patched with hide and wire as long as any-
thing remained to "hold by. The overcoat
(Continued on next page.)


HOW TIRED I AM!”
No one knows the suffering some women quietly endure.
They think it is only natural for them to have pain in the back,
throbbing headaches, dizzy spells, rheumatic twinges, irregular
heart, and to feel tired and worn out before the day is half
through. And so they bear up as best they can, in patience
and without complaint, never thinking they can be cured, never
suspecting the kidneys as the cause of their illness.
But it is not right for women to be always ailing, and the
best proof of this is given in the outspoken statements of Sydney
women who have been made well, and kept well, by Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, the great kidney and bladder medicine
for men and women, old and young. D oan’s Pills gently heal
the tired, overworked kidneys, and when the kidneys are well
they take out the liquid poisons which cause the above
symptoms, as well as bladder disorders, gravel, dropsy, rheu-
matism, lumbago, and wasting away.
Backache and Kidney Trouble Cured.
Mrs. Iv. Helmka, 27 Ada Street, Pyrmont, Sydney, says:— “About 13 years ago I caught a severe cold,
which flew to the small of my back, and seemed to affect my kidneys. My back was lame, and when cold
weather set in the pain would be dreadful. When I worked the sewing machine my back ached worst, and
I could never stay at it for any length of time. Having a large family to sew for made it very hard for
me. I heard of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and sent for some. Relief came almost immediately I
started to use them, and now my cure is perfect.”
Nine years later Mrs. Helmka sa^s: —“The above statement is quite true, and my cure has stood the
test of time, for I have been well for over nine years.”

was a bag, having a head-hole at the top,
and arm-holes at the sides. Those of them
who are still alive write cheques nowadays,
, ... , ’
and drive around with buggy and pair; while
the granddaughters bang the piano and
paint the old homestead (from photos in
grandmother’s album), and their brothers
fire J’s.P., shire councillors, vice-presidents,
successful exhibitors at the local show, or
something equally noteworthy. Uncle has
been immortalised. A crossing on Blind
Greek is named after him.
From daylight to twilight was the com-
mon working day. A coo-ee was the signal
for breakfast or for dinner. Some used
cow-bells. We had one at the start, but a
wall-eyed cow we bouglit lost it in the big
paddock. If the work were at the bottom
of the farm, dinner was brought down to
save time. Sometimes a bit of sheeting, or
an old shirt, was hoisted on the clothes-prop
wlien the planter was beyond coo-ee. It was
a time of happy relief when the flag went
up, or “mother called to dinner.”
Weeds grew quickly after the burning off,
and, when the corn came up, it was a race
between it and the wild growth for suprem-
acy. Then every row had to be chipped,
Occasionally, when there was much rain, a
second chipping was necessary. Then the
farmer had a respite until the corn was ripe,
albeit he had to protect it from the attacks
of pademelons, parrots and cockatoos.
That, however, is part and parcel of the in-
dustry.
Then came the pulling, of which the “mis-
sus” had to do her share. The stalks were
bent down, the cobs broken off and thrown
into heaps about 20 yards apart, about eight
rows being thrown into each row of heaps,
These heaps were afterwards bagged, and
the basrs carried out over the endless logs
to the road, whence they were carted to the
barn. After about four years, when most
of the timber and stumps had disappeared,
the bags were carted from the rows, which
dispensed with a lot of laborious lumping,
Finally, the cart was driven along by the
side of the standing corn, and the cobs were
thrown into it as they were pulled, which
was another big saving of labor. The husk-
ing was done at night, in the winter months,
when the cold compelled one to work hard
to keep the blood in circulation.
When the straddles are full the threshing
commences. The old-fashioned Yankee-
brand of hand-machine was a brute to turn—
and an imperfect brute. Much of the grain
was left on the core, and had to be rubbed
off by hand. A lot of the threshed corn,
too, had to be sieved to clear it from fluff
and dust before bagging. It required at least
five persons to keep the concern going. One
saw that the feed-box was always full, one
turned the handle, another fed the machine,
and two kept the cores clear and raked the
grain back. Women and girls took their
turn all round. The bagging was done while
the “missus” got the meals ready and washed
up, and the sewing and branding was mostly
done at night—with more threshing, if time
permitted. A good many bags were also
sewn during the alleged “smoke-o.” The
average farmer never allows any time to
run to waste. An incident came under
my notice one day that impressed this very
forcibly on my mind. An employee was in
the habit, while chipping corn, of stopping
for about five seconds at the end of each
row to light his pipe. At last the farmer
approached him. “I don’t mind giving you
an extra bob a week, Tom,” he said, “if yer
keep a-chippin’ ’stead o’ stoppin’ to strike
matches. Strikin’ matches takes up time.”
Shipping the bags of corn was a pleasant
diversion. Our wharf was half a mile from
the barn, where the bank was short and
steep. Two long skids were fixed from the
top to the landing, and down these the bags
were run. The skids oecame so slippery in time
as to require a man on guard at the bottom
to steady the bags. One day a new-chum
deck-hand, on his first trip up the river,
stood in front of the skids waiting his turn to
carry a bag on board, lie allowed the bag
to come down full force against the cross-
piece at the bottom, with the result that it
broke away, and the newchum stopped the
flying bag with his stomach, and immedi-
ately after took a header back into ;the
river. Another day the engineer, stepping
unsteadily on the gangway, toppled into the
river, bag and all. The farmer laughed for
a week over the new-chum’s misfortune, but
he always swore when he thought of the
engineer. He had lost him a bag of corn.
However, once the corn was shipped, there
was much satisfaction to be derived from a
trip to town for the settling. It was my
pleasure to accompany Uncle on these trips
r—to show him the way back, and to catch
his horse and hold it when he fell off. Har-
vest time only came once a year, and the
liquidation of the accumulated debts had to
be commemorated somehow. It is no un-
common thing to be without money for sev-
eral months at a stretch on a farm. Luckily,
an order sent up or down by the steamer
was always honored. The captains were
courteous. A flag hung out on a stick was
the only signal they wanted to come in to the
wharf; and, if an empty kerosene-tin was
suspended over the water on a pole, they
knew what was meant; they boat-hooked it
aboard, and brought it back full of treacle
next day.
Farm life is always a hard life; yet, if
the farmers of those early days had to toil
harder than the men on the same ground do
to-day, they lived proportionately well, and
yet at little cost. Ground corn made good por-
ridge for breakfast, and boiled green corn
gave a flavor to the salt meat. Vegetables
were plentiful, once the scrub was down ; and
fish and game were to be had in sight of the
hut any clay in the week. Wild fruits grew
there in abundance ; and we made pies and
puddings with tomatoes, gooseberries, nas-
sion-fruit, blackberries, etc. There was
always plenty of fresh milk and butter, wild
honey, and bacon and eggs.
After the demolition of the scrub, the axe
figured no more in the farm work. Our
only implements were brush-hooks and hoes.
Weeds grew thickly and luxuriantly after
the corn was pulled, reaching a height of
seven or eight feet. These were cut down
with the brush-hooks, and fired when dry.
Occasionally, in dry seasons, we had to sus-
pend operations until the weeds grew suffi-
ciently for a good burn-off, without which
we could not plant. It is here that the
ploughman has the draw on the man with the
hoe.
EDWARD S. SORENSON.
The Slayer of Individualism.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
COMMONWEALTH legislation was
not yet in its stride, and the yells of
the Absentees who felt a Federal
Land Tax as a thing not far off filled the
Australasian Club and overflowed into St.
Mary Axe. Men whom Australia had made
rich vilified the country that had fattened
them and bit the hand that fed them. And
having had my usual 10 minutes of plain
speaking after lunch, I left the Stinking
Fisn Party and went West and met Martin
Walsh by Piccadilly Circus. Martin had an
engagement with a South African-Maori-
lander-Irishm'an, and persuaded me to join
him in his duty call.
“He do be very, welty,” said Martin;
“rich as Burglar’s Gully at Kurnalpi, an’ he
do be mean—mean as a boozer thryin’ to
shpit. Come, you, an’ write him out of his
meanness, an’ put in his full name.”
I said something about the law of libel,
and Martin said the law of libel was a dam
silly t’ing, and he went to the duty-call at
Bloomsbury.
The mean man lived in a dingy house in
a back street behind the eastern side of
Russell Square—a house whose little break-
neck stairs had been carpeted, apparently,
about the time of William and Mary. The
air was full of strange odors —partly
Asiatic, and partly old cheese, and partly
the smell of Whitechapel trousers ; and the
ancient carpet was so far trodden into the
floor that in places it had become a mere
insanitary stain. The casements were small,
but to make up for that there were many
little and very dingy window panes in each
sash, and through an open door I saw a
small room where the ancient wall-paper
was peeling off, and showing efflorescences
of damp as of blue and green carbonates of
copper.
The subject of Martin’s duty-call was as
mean-looking as the house. I met a hard-
faced North of Ireland man who had been
Bessemerized in Africa and Maoriland. He
had a very unforgiving countenance, and he
pressed on us bad whisky in an ostenta-
tiously large bottle—quality sacrificed to
quantity.
Then he showed us some rough diamonds
in their matrix, and talked. The hard-faced
man under the coldness of his susceptible
whisky thawed —became frank—even openly
boastful and self-advertising. “Yerra,” said
he, “I med money in Sout’ Africky. I wint
there with a pound, an’ kem away with
seven thousand. Bekase I worked. Five
pound a load they ped us —did the comp’ny.
Little claims they wor ; an’ if the dirrt fell
into a claim from the next claim ’twas
belongin’ to the claim it fell into. The other
min they had Sundays off, an’ they niver
worked holidays. I did! Phwat was San’
Pathrick’s Day t’ me : Would San’ Path-
rick give me the menavellin’s of a sugar bag?
Not he! Whin the other min wint off worrk
I undthermined their claims on the boun-
dhry, an’ their durrt fell into me ground.
He —he —he —he ! —take some whisky, Mis-
tker. It does ye more good if ye take a
little. Don’t write annything about this;
but, if ye do, moind ye shpell me name
right. Me furrst name is Thomas. . . Yis-
yis-yis. Wan Sunday whin th’ other min
was at church or drinkin’, I picked undher
a good face, an’ a hundhred load fell into
me claim. He—he —he—he ! Five hund-
thred pound ! He—he—he ! More’n three
load fell on me—but ’twas no harrm. I dug
meself clear—an’ five hundthred pound
’twas. He —he—he !
“Another Sunday I unthermined two
sides an’ tuk out eight hundthred load a’
Monday. . . Wesht Afriky, ’tis no good. ’Tis
little gowld there is there. . . . The mishn’-
ries do shpile the place. Thim blackfellies
do get too know’n. . . . ’Tis the mishn’ries
make everything dear. . . . An’ them black-
fellies do get so know’n —they shpit at the
white man whin he be look’n’ th’ other way.
Wan time there ye’d give a naygur two
bright new ha’p’nys for a worn five shillin'
piece, an’ he would take it an’ bless you.
Now the mishn’ries make ’em too known,
an’ they’ll ax you for two single shill’ns for
a five shill’n bit. At laste they did whin I
left there.
“After I leave AfNky I go to Maoriland.
’Twas 15 years ago that. I have a gintale
bisness there—livin’ loike a gintleman. . .
Never soilin’ me ’ans. . . . ’Twas money-
lendin’ on pianners, wit’out bill-a-sale. . .
Oh! ’twas the gintale bisiness. . . Poor
people that do be proud payin’ anny in-
threst. Tin per cint. per wake I got from
thim. They’d pay annything to borrow
money saycret. . . An’ no ixpenses. No
office—no rent. .. Me office was the shtrate,
an’ the posht off us. . . An’ whin I lent money
’twas done in the borrower’s ’ouse, or we
wint into a pub, an’ the borrower he had to
pay tin shill’ns for the agreement that I
used to buy printed for t’rippens; an’ the
borrower had to pay for th’ drinks, too, thin.
He —he—he !”
We looked at the hard-faced man with
great disgust; but he was oblivious of criti-
cism, and went on.
“But the Democratic parrty they
shtopped me with Socialistic legisla-a-ation.
They put up a Bill to limit inthrest, an’ me
gintale bisness was done. So thin I kem to
London. . . I wo-o-n’t go back, ayther.
They’ll have no more chance t’ dhrive capi-
tal out of th’ counthry, if I know ’t. . . .
I’ll put the whisky away, me byes. . . Oh 1
’tis the English Gov’mint will have to teach
thim people in Maoriland not to dhrive
capital out o’ the country, shpilin’ trade, an'
breakin’ up th’ Impire. Yerra! dhrivin’
capital out o’ th’ counthry.” . . .
“Oh !” said Martin as we walked through
the thick soupy dusk down to the Fleshpots
of Soho, “give min like that power over
other min, an’ then God help the wurruld.”
Put a few hard-headed legislators help the
world more than a baker’s dozen of conven-
tional Deities.

£ooK Well After Yourself
If you consider for one moment how completely your comfort, happiness and success
in life are dependent upon the possession of health, you will realise how unwise it is
to allow yourself to get run down or to neglect to take steps healthwards the moment
you find yourself suffering from any complaint likely to impair your powers or sap
your vitality. Without degenerating into a faddist or becoming unduly solicitous
about yourself, you should, nevertheless, exercise continual watch over yoqr
health, and at the first appearance of any warning symptoms set about to remove
them. Remember that you may keep free from disease and remain hale and hearty
by means of an occasional dose of Beecham’s Pills. A very great number of the ills
that flesh is heir to have their rise in the digestive system and consequently the
surest method of preventing ill-health is to
TaHc
from time to time a digestive tonic of the proven efficacy of Beecham’s Pills. This
medicine cleanses the system, cures and prevents dyspepsia, keeps the liver and
kidneys in order, and regulates the bowels. At all times you can confidently rely upon
Bccchatn’s pills.
Sold everywhere in boxes, price HJh (56 pills) <S 2/9 (168 pills).

•Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I coiild see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the Epgldsh so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This led him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
Prepared- I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
