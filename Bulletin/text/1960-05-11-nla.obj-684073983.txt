PRIESTLEY ON LITERATURE
J. B. Priestley is quick to point out
in an introduction that his 500-page
Literature and Western Man (Heine-
mann) is not, strictly speaking, offered
as a literary history (“although at a
pinch it could serve as one”). What
prompted him to write it was his con-
viction that
ours is an age of supreme crisis,
when the most desperate decisions
have to be made, and that some
account of Western Man, in terms
of the literature he has created and
enjoyed, might help us to understand
ourselves... .and to realise where
we are and how we arrived here.
So it is very much an extended essay,
pretty personal in its judgments (“I
am the Western Man I know best”),
intended to make an extra-literary
point. It would be useless, then, to
complain about the scant attention
given to, say, Jonson, Milton, the meta-
physical poets. Dry den and Pope; the
absence of Lewis Carroll, Buchner and
Claudel; or the neglect of Australian
writers (Robert D. Fitz Gerald is
bracketed with Frederick Macartney in
a single side-glance at this country),
Priestley’s chief concern is necessarily
with writers whose influence has been
felt not only in their own countries
but throughout Europe, and with
tracing through them the shifts in the
relationships between literature and
society from the Renaissance to World
War 11.
This relationship he explains
throughout by a simplified (over-
simplified?) application of Jung’s
depth-psychology, frequently referring
to archetypal symbols and the inter-
workings of the conscious and uncon-
scious minds in art. Some time after
the Renaissance, he argues, literature
lost its superb internal balance be-
tween introversion and extroversion,
classicism and romanticism, conscious
and unconscious expression—as em-
bodied in the works of Rabelais,
Shakspeare, Cervantes and Montaigne
—and ever since, apart from isolated
figures in every age, it has been drift-
ing further and further away from the
centre of society.
In the 17th and 18th centuries it
became too public, too devoted to the
pursuit of reason and consciousness,
and this one-sidedness produced a
reaction from the neglected and
repressed unconscious which led to the
excesses of romanticism. In the 19th
century the weakening of religion and
the rise of industry drove literature
into confusion and division. The age
was “remarkably rich in great talent,”
but there was no longer any agreement
on what literature should do and be;
more and more writers adopted abso-
lute one-sided interpretations of life.
But somewhere in this age can be
found
almost all the ideas that have shaped
men’s lives during the present cen-
tury. The catastrophic outer world
of our age is the confused and angry
inner world of the nineteenth
century dramatised on the largest
scale.
In other words, literature is now
more divided and further away from
the fruitful centre of society than ever.
Reflecting our attempts “to compensate
for some failure in consciousness,” it
has become over-introverted, concerned
chiefly with exploring the recesses of
personality, neglecting the outer world.
It is a literature for specialists, mean-
ing little or nothing to the mass of
people—“the very people in danger of
losing true individuality to the collec-
tives of our time . . .”
Such a literature —though it produces
a Yeats, a Proust, a Thomas Mann —
cannot restore the balance. A new
religion is needed, and for that we
must hopefully wait. Meanwhile we
can only “challenge the whole de-
humanising, de-personalising process”
of our time “under whatever name it
may operate”;—
We may need much more to estab-
lish order, justice, real community, in
the outer world, and may not our-
selves find the right healing symbols
for the inner world, but, just as a first
step, we can at least believe that Man.
lives, under God, in a great mystery,
which is what we found the original
masters of our literature, Shakspeare
and Rabelais, Cervantes and Mon-
taigne, proclaiming at the start of
this journey And if we openly
declare what is wrong with us, what
is our deepest need, then perhaps the
despair and death will by degrees
disappear from our modern arts.
But isn’t this last exactly what
modern literature is trying to do?
Priestley evidently doesn’t think so; and
this brings us to what is the main weak-
ness of his book. He is prudently
reluctant to pass definite judgments on
any writer still living; and in order to
keep some sort of perspective he has to
end his survey at 1939. This tends to
fragment his picture of modern litera-
ture and what it is doing. One Would
like to have his full views on. say,
Robert Graves, Orwell, Angus Wilson,
Sartre, Camus and Brecht (about whom
he is exasperatingly non-committal).
The mere naming of names gets us
nowhere, and much has happened since
the ’thirties. One must be pardoned for
suspecting inevitable but unadmitted
gaps in the author’s astonishingly wide
reading as well as a certain lack of
sympathy for the younger poets and
novelists.
But when all this has been said we
are left with what Priestley has given
us, and that is a great deal. His book
is a bold, entertaining and liberating
restatement of the value to us, here and
now, of the literature of the past. He
is especially refreshing when he talks
of the writers —Shakspeare, Cervantes,
Montaigne; Moliere, Fielding,
Dickens ; Tolstoy. Chekhov. Yeats—in
whom he finds that fruitful balance
between public and private expression
that is essential to all great art; and
even while he is shrewdly chipping away
some of the snobbery that has gathered
around such reputations as Stendahl,
Flaubert, Gide and Joyce he reveals
unexpected insights into their qualities.
Indeed, the range of his sympathy
is so wide (who would have expected
him to see as much as he does in such
“dark” writers as Ibsen, Strindberg,
Kafka and Faulkner?) and his whole
approach to this forbidding subject so
skilfully marshalled as to make the
reviewer feel that the objections he has
raised to this book are merely niggling.

DUGONG
Dugong lumbering by the big ship ;
Sighing suggestively, till seamen think:
These might be the old fat wives
Of salt-junk sailors. The hare-lip
Dugong with pig-eyes that grey-blink
As they roll over, leading lady-lazy lives
Of too-fat mermaids. The dugong belong
To a legend and are thought lost,
Nearing extinction. Not they. The men
Who hunted them, the aborigincds, long
Since are lost; still, here, the ghost
Of charmed Ulysses might sail, chained,
again,
As long as this were midnight, roll its eye,
Unseeing, fall in love at their fat sigh.

S.A. Architecture
Architecture in South Australia

rises to so important an occasion.
Admitting that “It has not been the
aim to illustrate buildings over the
whole period of the State’s history” the
book, apart from a very few representa-

properly to cover Adelaide’s famous
North Terrace, still less to deal with the
beautiful old German stone and pise

the mansions of the squattocracy nor

MOSCOW'S DILEMMA
TTHE Prime Ministers’ Conference in
A London is running its usual course.
The leaders of the small new nations
turned up full of fire and zeal to right
the wrongs of color and do-down the
tyrants of South Africa. The older
hands calmed them down and went
on according to protocol. Presently
the great questions at issue, the plans
for the Summit Conference, the secrets
of defence and alliances, would be dis-
cussed.
Then the press-relations men would
move in, each with his particular little
axe to grind, and presently, as ever,
would make sufficient bricks out of
straw to satisfy the curiosity of a public
—a curiosity sated already by peerings
at Mr. Chessman in his death-chair and
at the Royal bride and her bridegroom
at Westminster.
It did not need a prophet to discern
—in the light of past experience—that
a week after the conference began it
would transpire in Canada that Mr.
Diefenbaker was the reincarnation of
Socrates, that in India Mr. Nehru was
an Asian giant, that Mr. Menzies was
the dominating figure in world politics
in his own country, and that in South
Africa Dr. Verwoerd’s deputy had
justly won the title of Louw the Lion.
This invariably happens upon the
revelation of such of the discussions as
it is thought politic to give forth, and
which, in substance, invariably adds-up
to nothing of importance whatever.
This, however, doesn’t mean that
nothing is done at these conferences.
They are the meetings that hold the
Commonwealth together, thrash-out
differences, concert policy, provide a
safety-valve and make defence, diplo-
matic and trade plans and adjust
relationships.
They are outspoken as a general
rule, and they are dissimilar from the
conferences of Communist Powers, in
which, judging by the reports issued,
the debates seem to consist (outside
the instructional expositions of policy
and intention by the Russian leaders
and their stooges) of cries of “Hail
Big Brother and All His Works.”
'T'HIS London conference is more
important than usual, taking place
so soon before the Summit Conference
on May 16..
It is important that Mr. Macmillan
shall go to that conference with the
solid backing of at least the great
nations of the Commonwealth and be
able to speak for all of them.
Chou En-lai has done the world a
good turn by assuring that, for the
first time in a world conference, this
is likely to be possible, for even
Nehru, hitherto always detached, has
changed his opinions, and is no longer
convinced that stroking the Chinese
leopard will make him purr.
The gravely hostile reception of
Indian legislators and public of Chou
En4ai showed both Chou and his host
plainly what Indians now think of the
intentions of Communism, which is
facing its final test.
The Summit Conference will follow
not only the Prime Ministers’ Confer-
ence in London but a Communist con-
ference and the Nato conference in
Instanbul, where the students, rioting
against their own Government, took
time off to cheer for Nato and
“liberty.”
The decisions of the Nato meeting
were arrived at with unusual clear-
cut unanimity, and leave little doubt
but that there will be a solid West
arrayed on the Summit.
It is obvious that Khrushchev in-
tends to attempt to create division,
based on France’s fears of Germany,
and on an accord with President Eisen-
hower and President de Gaulle on a
regal level by the assumption of the
mantle of the ageing Voroshilov, who
has been titular President of the
U.S.S.R. for many years past. His
new office of Head of State would
make him the equal of President Eisen-
hower and President de Gaulle and
senior in diplomatic precedence to Mr.
Macmillan.
The shooting-down of an American
aircraft, the reorganisation of Russian
Communist control and the thunderous
abuse, pessimism and threats from the
Kremlin as a prelude to the meeting tell
their own story.
It has become more certain each
week that Khrushchev has been mainly
concerned with Germany, not with an
agreement for world peace and dis-
armament, which is a practical impossi-
bility so long as Russia and China
remain Communist, since peace with
capitalism is directly in opposition to
the destructive principles of dialectical
materialism as taught by the Com-
munist theory.
What he has been aiming for is firstly
the use of Summit discussions as a
bargaining-point from which to legalise
his control of Western Europe right up
to the Elbe; next a rider leaving it open
for him to press his conquests into a
West Germany discredited and
snatched into no-man’s land from
under the wing of divided Western
Allies.
This he will not achieve. If he had
had any hope of making progress the
clumsy institution of collectivisation of
agriculture in East Germany, which
has catapulted thousands of refugees
into the lap of the West each week for
the past month, and his even clumsier
threats of what he intends to do if the
West does not agree to East Germany
being made a permanent satellite State
of Communism, dispelled it.
The Instanbul Conference stood for
an all-German plebiscite supervised
by the United Nations or great Powers
to decide Germany’s future as a whole,
with the right to self-determination,
union or separation, for both East and
West. It reaffirmed that the Allied
troops must be allowed to remain in
Berlin pending settlement. And there
is a clear nine-point programme on
disarmament—reasonable but difficult
for Moscow to accept.
/"\N the whole, no agreement in any
way effective can be come to at the
Summit, under present circumstances,
worth a row of beans, save on Berlin
and the future of Germany. And this
will be the test of the Communist
bloc’s sincerity and readiness to agree.
It will be no more.
It is increasingly evident that the
balance is shifting to Asia. China,
which already has intruded into the
affairs of Africa, is the determinative
in disarmament and on the issue of
where aggression is to end. The
threat is there for Russia as well as
the West.
With the vast and rapid increase of
population, China must soon burst its
bounds if it is to improve its standards
of living and feed and clothe its people.
To do that it must either intrude force-
fully into Russian territory or destroy
some of the more helpless peoples of
South-east Asia or some other contin-
ent and replace them. It is logic that
because of China, Russia dare not dis-
arm, apart from its own aggressive
plans.
China already has a population equal
to 170 per square-mile, on Peking’s
official reckoning, including desert and
cold northern lands.
Agreements for world peace, especi-
ally when one of the parties is headed
by dedicated Communist Govern-
ments which believe it a mission to
destroy capitalism wherever found, are
likely to be mere empty and delusive
talk. Just about as delusive as the talk
of allowing China into the United
Nations.


SKY THE LIMIT?


PLAIN ENGLISH
Khrushchev Prepares
The expectations of the cynics that
Khrushchev would make special pre-
parations to ensure the failure of the
Summit Conference in an atmosphere
detrimental to the Western Allies is being
realised.
As a gesture to impress the simple-
minded of the West with the superiority
of Russia as a workers’ paradise, he
announced the abolition of income-tax
and the impending shortening of the
working-week.
The abolition of the taxes, he remarked,
was “only possible in a Socialist State,
since it is the people themselves who own
the means of production.”
The week has been allegedly short-
ened before, but this act of clemency
to the toilers has always been followed
by a sudden burst of volunteer eagerness
on the part of the proletariat to work
longer hours than ever for the glorious
service and welfare of the Workers’ Only
Fatherland.
Those who do not volunteer to scab
on the official hours, and work in week-
ends and other times free, are apt to
find themselves low down on the
preference-list for vacations in holiday-
resorts, permission to take part in sport
or to go to football-matches or enter-
tainments. The more reluctant observers
of the Government’s shorter hours are
even apt to find themselves going on a
long journey to somewhere north-east
of Lake Baikal.
The point about the abolition of taxa-
tion which Khrushchev does not
explain to the workers of the decadent
West is that it is not possible for a
Government to run without revenue,
especially when it has a huge military
Budget; and that if it doesn’t take it out
of the workers’ pockets one Way it takes
it another—in the shape of higher prices,
fares, cheap labor or in some other way.
In plain fact the Soviet citizen is more
heavily taxed in relation to his resources
and in more ways than any other citizen.
With Khrushchev’s announcements
allegedly representing “the springtime of
joy” for Russians was brigaded a signifi-
cant set of changes and events. First the
ancient Voroshilov was removed from the
Presidency and replaced by a Khrush-
chev secretary. Then the Communist-
party central organisation, the real
government and policy-maker of the
U.S.S.R., was reduced from 10 to six.
All the military commanders-in-chief
were suddenly replaced.
The summary of these changes was
that the U.S.S.R. was virtually geared
for war-type government, under a tight
Communist-party dictatorship, while the
fact was being covered-up with lavish
promises of good times to come.
On the whole, what is happening in
Moscow carries the implication that
Khrushchev intends to force the Berlin
issue and is gearing-up for the use of
force. The organisation at headquarters
is created.
The central war-dictatorship has been
created. The pretext has been created.
The Russian public have been promised
something which they will never get so
as to generate anger against the United
States for denying it to them.
Governor-Genera! and Press
[l'toih ‘'Collins Street”]
Lord Dunrossil invited half-a-dozen
Melbourne newspapermen real re-
porters, not mere managing-editors or
directors —to have a yarn with him at
Government House, where he stayed, and
it seemed to me, standing there before
the bright fire in a study while he sat
on the arm of a chair, that it must have
been a gesture quite characteristic of
him.
The new G.-G. is an informal man
with a natural dignity in every line of
his spare frame. He was dressed in one
of those generously cut English tweed
suits that was not new —dressing the
G.-G. suitably for each occasion is quite
a problem, I was told —and, compara-
tively, the formal suiN of the press
looked rathe/ stuffy.
Most of us, like Lord Dunrossil,
drank beer. Our guards were up at first
with the very distinguished newcomer,
but after a couple of the very large
glasses of beer with our disarming host
they were soon lowered.
It was not a formal press-conference
or interview in the accepted sense, and
the talk was chiefly of comparatively
unimportant matters protocol, photo-
graphy and such —but the British breadth
of outlook that Australians are at last
—slowly—acquiring was evident when
he talked of how large Australia was,
and how much larger the Empire.
“There are differences throughout the
Empire,” he said. “Consider my native
land, Scotland. The Highlanders and
Lowlanders have differences, and there
are differences between the Highlanders
and the Islanders, and between some of
the Islanders, too! Yet love of humanity,
if it is real,” he added shrewdly, “should
begin with our neighbors.”
I guessed this was a hint that the self-
confessed Lovers of Humanity ought to
start with Australians, not Russians.
He also welcomed the great migrant-
intake here because the newcomers
brought new crafts, techniques and arts
as they had to Britain, especially
southern England, centuries ago.
He led the way outside for a photo-
grapher to take some pictures and bent
his long frame obediently to the young
men’s requests; he is an ardent photo-
grapher himself. Then he had to return
to dress once again for an official dinner.
Every Post a Winner
[From Canberra]
Whirlwind tours to remote areas in the
past couple of weeks by Country-party
Leader Jack McEwen have sparked-off
renewed rumors that he is again seriously
contemplating contesting the leadership
stakes in the coalition parties.
The only way McEwen can ever hope
to become Prime Minister is to turn
Liberal, after which his chances would
be better than most.
Within the first two weeks of taking
over the reins as Acting P.M., McEwen
was off to Central Australia and then to
the remote areas of south-west Queens-
land.
In both areas he discussed man-to-man
the problems of the people in those areas
and indicated the Government’s attitude
to those problems.
The “locals” were elated at the visit,
the first by a full-time or acting P.M. for
some years.
This could be the first step in a cam-
paign to win support not only from
within Government ranks, but from the
people themselves for a man with Prime
Ministerial aspirations.
Espionage
The shooting-down of an unarmed
American aircraft, admitted by the U.S.
State Department to have been “prob-
ably” engaged in obtaining “information”
inside Russia, at the express orders of
Khrushchev seems to have arisen from a
blunder which played right into his ready
hands.
It appears that the machine was piloted
by a civilian, and, according to the
Russians, was on a flight at great height
from Pakistan to Norway. It was at
first suggested that it had been
brought down in the region of the
Turkish border, where the Russians un-
doubtedly have been using a decoy beam
to lure machines off their courses. But
later it turned out to have been over the
Urals, 1200 miles inside Russia.
There have been confusing reports from
both sides, including some about how
the aircraft was brought down. But it
seems that the pilot bailed-out after his
aircraft was hit by a guided missile and
brought along with him radio-photo-
graphs and other materials which showed
him to be a spy ; and on Russian reports
he must have been as talkative as a
schoolgirl.
His operations professedly have
shocked the Kremlin deeply—the same
Kremlin which has honeycombed the
world with spies, which secured its know-
how to build nuclear weapons by spying
which involved the subornation of
nationals of other countries and, worse
still, refugees who had been given
sanctuary in the United Kingdom and
the United States to betray their bene-
factors.
Even when Russia’s salvation was being
achieved through the provision of war
material by its Western allies, it had a
vast network operating.
The Gouzenko trials, the Rosenberg
trials which led to the execution of the
principals in the United States, the Petrov
Commission inquiry and all that lay be-
hind it have cumulatively proved that
Russia has always had a world network
of espionage and has had no scruple in
using it and in going far beyond mere
collection of information which it is
prudent that a country should have about
potential enemies.


It has been, and is, deliberately engaged
in world-wide espionage, coupled with
sabotage and subversion which have been
carried into the innermost of the offices
of those who have shown themselves
most friendly to it.
The Victimised Landlord
[From “C.S.”]
That downtrodden race, the landlords
in Victoria, have had another slap in the
face because of political expediency:
the Bolte Cabinet has decided to abolish
retrospectivity in rent-increases granted
by the Fair Rents Court, and by its
decision to set-up a committee “to
advise what can be done to help pen-
sioners to whom increases mean hard-
ship” has given the court a broad hint
that hardship should be considered in
assessing rents. /
I- have been watching the court
operate in recent weeks. It works almost
to. a formula. When a party applies for
a determination, a valuer, of the Fair
Rents Board examines the property,
establishes its current market-value, and
the court then fixes a fair rent at a
per cent, net return, allowing for all
outgoings, such as insurances, rates,
collections and depreciation of 1| per
cent, on weatherboard and one per cent,
on brick. The 5j per cent, is about , the
mortgage-rate of the Commonwealth
Bank.
Considering that 7 p.c. on unsecured
notes is available at times from com-
panies of such tonnage as 1.C.1.A.N.Z.,
five-and-a-half is a poor return; and
the F.R.B. formula is based on the
supposition that the landlord will collect
his rent every week of the year, that
there will be no defaults, and no periods
in which the property is unlet.
One of the applicants was a landlord
who had retired in 1940 and bought a
block of four flats at St. Kilda. He
occupied one, and the rents of the others
(£lO 10s.) he reckoned on providing him
with a reasonably comfortable old age.
He has made a number of efforts to
get a fairer rent, and on this occasion
they were raised to £5 55., giving him a
gross return of £l5 15s. In terms of the
purchasing-power of the basic-wages of
1940 and 1960, he is left a very poor
man.
The loss of retrospectivity in land-
lords’ applications may mean that instead
of getting a fairer deal from April 1,
when the amendment to the Act was
timed to begin, they will have to wait
for many months, because of the large
number of applicants and the necessity
to value each property.
Pensioners are in a special class, and
there is some evidence that old people
have been forced to agree to rent-rises
because they were led to fear that if they
opposed them they would be taken to
court and ordered to pay retrospectively,
a financial burden beyond their capacity.
In the pensioners’ cases I heard, how-
ever, I was left with reservations. Sworn
evidence was not given in any of them,
and I was doubtful if all the incomes
in houses where the tenant.was a pen-
sioner had been given, and in others it
seemed to me that the clothes worn by
the relatives who appeared for the old
people were much more expensive and
newer than those worn by the wicked
landlord whom they were asking the
court to order to subsidise their parents.
One of the advocates told me that in
many of the houses his firm controlled
the tenant was a pensioner, but it was
a very prosperous household, and that
very few pensioners lived alone in houses.
One of those he interviewed told him
she could not afford to pay any more
rent because she was going to Queens-
land for a holiday for six months to
avoid the Melbourne winter -and spring.
Ghosts
Though Dr. Evatt has gone from the
political scene he has left behind a ghost
of the past in the form of Mr. Allan
Dalziel.
Mr. Dalziel was Dr. Evatt’s Fidus
Achates for 20 years. He was a law unto
himself who made his own political state-
ments and wrote chiding telegrams to
the Prime Minister.
He had critics, but they usually seemed
to come to a bad end. One of them
was the unfortunate A. M. Blain, M.P.,
who, when in uniform during the war,
received a letter from Mr. Dalziel, as
secretary of a body called the Legion
of Christian Youth, in which he was
informed that a necessary incentive to
Australians to enlist would be the insti-
tution of a “social order totally different
from the present”; that it was “to Russia
the people look for a practical example
of what cap be accomplished.” Mr.
Dalziel asked: “What better way could
the Government show their sincerity
than to implement social legislation now,
using Russian principles as a basis?”
All that happened when Mr. Blain
asked questions about these views, ex-
pressed by a writer who had become
private secretary to the Australian Minis-
ter for External Affairs at a later stage,
was that somebody rose in the House
under privilege and accused him of
having used his Parliamentary pass while
a p.-0.-w. to get special favors from the
Japanese and that when a Select Com-
mittee was appointed to inquire into the
utterly groundless charge, Dr. Evatt took
the chair, held the inquiry in private and
the libeller got off scot-free. Mr. Dalziel
continued on his own sweet way. But
the Federal A.L.P. executive by resolu-
tion ordered that a special effort —which
succeeded —be made to defeat Blain in
his seat.
Mr. Dalziel became one of the
martyrs whose troubles impelled Dr.
Evatt to appear before the Petrov Com-
mission when the Petrov papers dis-
closed that he had a code-name with the
M.V.D. officially approved from Mos-
cow.
Before the commission he admitted
that he was a frequent visitor, “in the
course of his duties,” to the flat occupied
by several Soviet officials and that he
became “very friendly” with one of
them, Nosov.
The commission found no evidence
that he had given any information of a
secret or confidential character to any
Soviet official.
When Dr. Evatt left office as leader
Mr. Dalziel was the only member of
his staff not provided for. The Labor
party was not anxious to have him, but
Mr. Haylen, a kindly soul, decided to
give him work (he says) in his office in
the Sydney Parliamentary Rooms at £lO
a week paid out of his own pocket.
That the Labor party took exception
to this—one of its leaders, Gough Whit-
lam, to such an extent that he wrote to the
Prime Minister protesting—was due not
to any suspicion of Mr. Dalziel’s Leftism,
but to the fact that he was supposed to
be writing critical articles about Labor’s
leaders in the “Century,” the organ of
Mr. J. T. Lang.
This he blandly denied, but the dis-
pute reached such a point that it seemed
as if Mr. Whitlam, or Mr. Haylen, not
Mr. Dalziel, would take the rap and
a “summit” (or peace) conference be-
tween Calwell and Whitlam and the
N.S.W. Executive officers had been
called, though what for nobody seemed
sure. Calwell was firm that it was not
to discipline either Haylen or Whitlam,
but said it was merely intended to
smooth ruffled feelings and to discuss the
“activities of Mr. Dalziel.”
Mr. Dalziel has faded out of Mr.
Haylen’s office, making the conference
unnecessary. But his retirement does not
finally lay the ghost. He is resigning, he
says, from the A.L.P. to stand for Dr.
Evatt’s old electorate of Barton as a
“Christian Socialist.”
The incident, trivial in itself, provides
a not very pretty picture of the con-
fusion and opportunism, the quarrels and
schisms that beset the unruly and un-
cohesive mob that calls itself a “Labor
party.”
Animal Exports
[From “Muggra Way”]
Although the kangaroo is part of our
national coat-of-arms the animal is cer-
tainly a pest in parts of the outback, and
its numbers must be reduced. Even the
most enthusiastic shooters or consumers
of kangaroo-tail soup, however, surely
wouldn’t approve of a recent incident in
New York in which a live kangaroo
figured.
The unfortunate animal was “donated”
by a concern called Animal Talent Scouts
to assist in publicising the Cancer Crusade,
and was led up Madison Avenue by two
women dressed in “Jcangaroo clothing.”
On the way, with photographers in attend-
ance, a dog hopped out of a parked
car, nipped at the alarmed kangaroo, and,
in the words of the “New York Times,”
generally treated her as if she were a
mailman.
A policeman and a bystander tried to
separate the animals, but (again accord-
ing to the newspaper) half-a-dozen photo-
graphers yelled, “Hey, mister, get out of
the picture, will ya?” Finally the dog was
pulled away, and the kangaroo was got
into a convertible and driven off.
The cause may have been a good one,
but the treatment of the Australian
animal was a bit poor.


Society
AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS
At a function to honor the turn-
ing - off of a gentleman from one
of the topmost positions of the public
service the stereotyped reference to his
“unblemished record” brought a twinkle
to his eyes. His file had been endorsed,
“No promotion for five years,” follow-
ing his bibulous and belated return with
a colleague from the tea-time break of
unpaid overtime. As they had been
seconded only a few days to the depart-
ment they strolled unwittingly into the
women’s room. Before shrill feminine
protests they fled, one to his boarding-
house and a sleepless night, the other to
a doctor-friend’s surgery, from which he
emerged with a certificate attesting judge-
soberness. The tribunal next day awarded
the shrewd one a fiver fine and a bar
to promotion for five years ; the
unresourceful miscreant got off with a
severe reprimand.—“Wynbal.”
+}<■ ♦+<■
“Patti”: That we should live to see
the day! Here’s a verbatim quote of a
speech made by a football-coach to his
team at half-time: “It’s not clever to
swear at or abuse the umpire. These men
are not fools ; they are top League
umpires. They know the game. If they
say it’s a free-kick, it’s a free-kick. Just
shut-up and play on.” What next!
♦l* * *>
“Wog”: During the heavy rains a hole
about 4ft. across and 2ft. deep appeared
in Flinders Lane (Melbourne) in front
of my place of business. I rang the
City Council and suggested that a car
could easily fall into the hole in the
blinding rain. An hour later a utility
was just so trapped, and some men were
trying to lever it out with long planks.
I noticed the name on the side: “Melb.
City Council.”
♦j* »*♦
“Seascan”: The new 14,000-ton iron-
ore freighter Mount Keira, about to
commission at Whyalla (S.A.), is a very
clean ship: for a crew of 47 men she
has 32 bathrooms, six washing-machines
and a permanent swimming-pool.
*X* ❖ ♦>
“Kune”: An elegant Melbourne
spinster-secretary who has conducted for
years a one-woman campaign to save the
city’s stray cats from starvation is telling
friends a joke on herself. Several nights
a week, armed with a small suitcase of
chopped meat, she sallies forth to a
rendezvous with cats; her route takes
“You remind me of a picture I once saw called ‘Still Life'.”
her into some of the city’s murkier lane-
ways, where she’s become a well-respected
nocturnal figure. Occasionally a sympa-
thiser will offer her cash towards the
meat-bill, which the lady usually and
thankfully accepts. One such donation
(a pound-note) came the other night from
an employee of a club somewhere along
the cats’ supper-trail. Standing on the
steps of the club, he had handed-over
the note and was telling how fond his
old mother was of all cats, when another
employee came to the door to tell him
he was wanted urgently. He bounced
up the steps, faced-about at the door-
way and, with a dozen or so passers-by
within earshot, yelled to the cat-lover:
“So long, lovey. And remember —every
time I see you there’s a quid waiting for
you! ”

“R.A.M.”: It was most appropriate
that a' plane from Geraldton to Perth
was a Friendship ; the passengers
included Mrs. French, Mrs. Italiano and
Miss English.
❖ ♦>
“S”: As they grow older and stouter
the Melbourne newspapers also have got
staider. They reported the famous and
fiery Percy Cerutty, the outspoken ath-
letics coach, in a TV-interview, but left
out the essence of Cerutty, who was being
tackled about a statement he made in
N.Z. that women were out of place in
the Olympics because nobody wanted to
see muscle-bound, unfeminine women.
One of the panel murmured that a noted
Australian girl athlete was a nice little
thing. “How do you know?” demanded
Percy. “Have you seen her stripped?”
The pained silence made him realise this
was a little indelicate and he amended it
to, “1 mean, have you seen her in her
bath?”
❖ ❖ ♦>
“Ardoyne”: Latest hire-purchase peril
(B. 27/4/’6O) is “the package deal”: one
Victorian firm offers a 21 in. TV, auto-
matic washing-machine, clothes-dryer,
mantel-radio, record-player and room-
heater, all for 47-bob a week. I totted-
up the cost—slightly over 500gns., not
including interest-charges. The advertise-
ment didn’t state how long paying-off
500gns., plus interest, at 475. a week
would take, nor what would happen in
your fuse-box when you had the whole
bang lot going at once. But it did
suggest a few extra appliances that could
be added to the package to make your
home really complete.
TAKING THE WATERS
“During a debate on whether swimming in
.Sydney Domain baths was healthy, Alderman
Gil Roper said that an old woman who swims
there regularly takes a glass of water front!
the baths every morning as a health drink.
Drink to me only with thine eyes
If we’ve run out of wine,
Or leave a kiss within the cup —
But never Harbor brine.
The thoughts that from the Harbor rise
Are too, too, too divine,
But might I of its nectar sup
l think I’d stick to thine.
Some aged lady, for a whim,
Drinks Harbor brine, I see,
As giving her a hope that there
She may not withered be,
But even thou therein rqcryst swim
And send a cup to me-
lt still will only smell, I swear,
More of itself than thee.

Anzac Day, 1960. The crowds in-
specting the thousands of wreaths
on the Cenotaph have been moved
back, and Martin Place is clear to
the footpaths, the official party gather-
ing for the first Sunset Ceremony in
Sydney. Enters from the Pitt Street end
a tall, rather untidily-dressed man, too
erect for stone-sober, straight down the
centre of the road, his eyes fixed ahead,
his step firm and martial. Fifty paces
from the Cenotaph he halts abruptly and
stands stiffly to attention. For a pause
he remains perfectly motionless, eyes
front; then with the precision of a color-
party he moves off again, marching like
a Guardsman. He skirts the Cenotaph,
passes three rather bewildered-looking
policemen, one after another, and oppo-
site the exact centre of the monument
snaps to a halt. As though at the crack
of an order he makes a perfect right-
turn, clicks his left heel into position
and stands rigidly to attention. A short
military pause, then his right arm sweeps
up ; for just the right length of time he
holds a salute, before cutting the hand to
his side with the speed of a flashing
scimitar. Another smart, soldierly turn,
and he' marches stiffly back the way he
came, his erect carriage and straight
course a marvel of mind over matter. —

“Sister Ell-ell”: The most amusing Old
Grey Mare, matron of a busy country
hospital, fetched-up here in Adelaide for
the Anzac March. It appears she has
regular argument with the boiler-stoker
at the hospital, and the doctor said, “You
two will still be arguing when you go
Down Yonder, and he’ll have the edge on
you, because he has his ticket!” “Far
from it,” the matron said. “When I see
him there I’ll say, ‘This is what you
have your ticket for, so get cracking,
and remember, there’s no overtime
here !’ ”

“Irving”: Mention of squeegees and
the military ranks allowed or constrained
to use them (B. 20/4/’6O) reminds me.
As staff-sergeant, I demurred that n.c.o.’s
don’t do fatigues when, a camp-hospital
patient, I was detailed by a ward-sister
to grab a bucket and squeegee and report
to the kitchen of the sisters’-mess. “Do
as you’re told!” a W. 0.1 fellow-patient
gritted in my ear, as he grabbed a
bucket and mop and enthusiastically
departed kitchenwards. I followed to
find, in the mess-kitchen, several other
n.c.o. patients filling buckets from two
10-gallon kegs. Then, each with a
bucket, squeegees carried at the slope as
pure camouflage, we filed through the
moonlight in the direction of the creek,
the off-duty sisters bringing-up the rear.
In the course of the decorous good time
had by all, we learned that because of
a tiff between the sisters and the officers
of a nearby regiment the officers had
declined a scheduled party. We enjoyed
our roles as porous pawns in the game.

“Jock”: When I met-up with Smithy
in this year’s Anzac Day march in the
city I remembered the time he was a ser-
geant in one of our night-raids in France.
A raid must be streamlined (a phrase we’d
not heard of then) and there must be
exact co-operation between infantry and
gunners ; the barrage must come down
at a predetermined hour, remain there
a few minutes, then move on to the
reserve line and finally form a box
“Haven't l married you before somewhere?"
around the trench-system to be assaulted.
Raiding infantry were required to reach
No Man’s Land at a set time and
rush the enemy trenches at zero -plus-
x min. Watches were usually sent to
brigade h.q., where for 24 hours they
were checked and rechecked. On the
night of the raid, when the checked
watches arrived, Smithy, a bucolic type,
scanned the watch on his wrist. Look—
there s no - - - synchronising-stuff on
my watch. Smithy mightn t have been
as learned as the others but what a
soldier. *
“Patti”: Reaction of New Australian
mother when she surveyed her new son
in his cot was rather alarming—she wailed
and wept and hung over him, all the
time pouring out a torrent of completely
incomprehensible words at me. I was
relieved at the arrival of her husband
who spoke a little English. Weeping,
Momma turned to him, and he also
looked at the cot in dismay, peered to
read the card attached to the top, then
patted her reassuringly on the shoulder,
whffe in broken English he made smiling
explanation to me. How was I to know
that in his language the word “male”
means “sick”?

of S.A.’s inner-suburban hotels which
makes a feature of smorgasbord

inquired again, and were told to go
through to the dining-room, where we
found the depleted smorgasbord . . . My
hostess was telling her ma-in-law about
this, and ma-in-law, a frequent luncher-

we should have slipped a tip to the recep-

Orphan School Farm
to St. Thomas’s
By DAVID ADAMS
ON April 22 the last three-
mile gap between
Badgery Creek and
Kemp's Creek on the
old Orphan School Road was
tar-sealed, and an area of
delightful hilly, spotted-gum
country that has long been a
favorite with Sydneyside
motorists not afraid of a dusty
road will now become a scenic
highway possessing no terrors
for even the most immaculate
car-owners.
The Orphan School Road is
a very old road —older, prob-
ably, than the Great Western
Road (built in 1815) between
Parramatta and Penrith, with
which it runs roughly parallel—
and is nowadays generally
known as the Mulgoa Road.
For a century or more it was a
gravel-and-corduroy road, and
a very good one as gravel roads
go, but motor-cars and gravel
roads are not suited to each
other.
Tar-sealing of the road had
proceeded fairly well up to
about 1951, but the old bridges
at Kemp's Creek and South
Creek were low-level timber
structures, with corduroy ap-
proaches, liable to flooding in
wet weather. So completion of
the tarring was held-up for
nearly 10 years until new
bridges were built at higher
levels and the road regraded
here and there.
Impetus has been given to
the work by the activity at the
Warragamba Dam; the road
represents the shortest way
through Wallgrove and Wal-
lacia to Warragamba. It will
also provide another route
from the Bankstown area,
through Liverpool, to the roads
leading across the Blue Moun-
tains.
The road gets its old name
from the fact that it ran from
the Orphan School Farm- to-
wards Mulgoa, the, country of
the Cox family.
Soon after leaving the
Orphan School grounds, which
were originally a grant of 13,700
acres lying between Cabramatta
Creek, Prospect Creek and the
Cowpasture Road, and taking
in present-day Bonnyrigg, parts
of Cabramatta, Fairfield,
Smithfield and Prospect, the
road ran through Cecil Park
and Macquarie Farm, grants to
Judge Advocate John Wylde
and Thomas Wylde respec-
tively, and then by A. E.
Kemp’s property Mt. Vernon,
part of which has recently
been subdivided near Kemp's
Creek.
Then on through the original
grant of Badgery’s called
Exeter and now known as
Badgery’s Creek township. On
part of William Johnston’s
grant on the northern side of
the road at Badgery’s Creek the
Sydney University Experimen-
tal Farm is now a landmark,
with its turkey-nest dams a
monument to the work of
Geddes.
On meeting the Bringelly
Road at Luddenham (John
Blaxland’s old grant) there is a
short turn to the left, and then
a road runs on to Wallacia and
Warragamba. Mulgoa is
slightly to the north of Wal-
lacia.
The Orphan School grounds,
granted in the first 10 years
of the nineteenth-century, were
originally intended as a farm
to help support the orphan
schools in Sydney and Parra-
matta. Macquarie in 1810
mentions passing through the
orphan-school farm on his
way to the Cowpastures ; but
the 13,700 acres did not remain
intact for long. In 1827 and
1828 the grant was subdivided
and sold to private interests.
One of the few relics today is
Orphan School Creek, which
ran through the grounds, and
which is crossed on the Smith-
field Road at the El Rancho
drive-in, near Bossley Park.
A considerable part of the
grounds was afterwards taken-
up by Maltese market-gar-
deners. It is generally low-
lying country with a maximum
height of about 100 ft. above
sea-level, whereas across the
Cowpasture Road, at Cecil
Hills, the Prospect ridge rises
to 450 ft.
Once the chief suburb nearby
was Smithfiekl. Today Smith-
field seems to be disappear-
ing under encroachment from
Fairfield and Merrylands.
With the tar-sealing of the
road between Badgery Creek
and Kemp’s Creek a bitumen
roadway now runs from War-
ragamba and Wallacia through
to Parramatta without at any
point touching one of the con-
gested roads or highways. This
is possible by reason of the
almost direct run from Bonny-
rigg through Smithfield f o
Merrylands. Some of the
Smithfield stretches could do
with widening and regrading,
with a new bridge here and
there, but it is bitumen all the
way. The, route could soon
become a major alternative
traffic artery as the big area
between Campbelltown and
St. Mary’s develops towards
the Nepean and the Blue Moun-
tains.
Tn his diary on November 28,
1810, Governor Lachlan
Macquarie wrote:
At J past 6 a.m. Mrs. M. and
myself set out in the carriage from
Parramatta, accompanied b - y the
gentlemen of our own party and
Mr. Gregory Blaxland, to prosecute
my tour of inspection of the
interior parts of the Colony. We
passed close to Prospect Hill, and
by the Devil’s Back to Mr. Bayly’s
farm near the South Creek; we
halted here a little while and
admired very much the situation
of Mr. Bayly’s farm and the neat-
ness of his barn and stockyards;
thence passed across the South
Creek to a small farm belonging
to Mr. Gregory Blaxland, at whose
farm we halted to breakfast.
In travelling over the “Devil’s
Back” Macquarie would have
been negotiating the hilly
country on the Orphan School
Road, near Cecil Park, once
known locally as Judge’s Hills
because it was granted origin-
ally to Judge Advocate Wylde
and Judge Barron Field (at
Hinchinbrook). “Mr. Bayly’s
farm” was Henry Bayly’s,
alongside E r s k i n e Park
(across South Creek from
Gregory Blaxland’s Villiers
Farm), and known today as
Bayly Park.
Nicholas Bayly had a hold-
ing of over 2000 acres ad-
joining the Badgery property
of Exeter, and including the
junctions of Kemp’s Creek and
Badgery’s Creek with South
Creek. The homestead of
Fleurs, on the road between
Kemp’s Creek and St. Mary’s,
is on the old Nicholas Bayly
grant. Leeholme is on the old
Blaxland property, next-door
to Villiers Farm, on the Lud-
denham Road; it was from here
that Blaxland, with Lawson
and Wentworth, organised their
party for the crossing of the
Blue Mountains in 1813.
The new all-bitumen Mulgoa
Road will take more visitors to
historic St. Thomas's Church,
on a hill above the road at
Mulgoa. It is now 129 years
okb The foundation-stone was
laid by a daughter of Sir John
Jamison in 1836, and the church
was consecrated by Bishop
Broughton in 1838.
The lands for the church
and rectory were given by the
Cox brothers. The first rector
was the Rev. Thomas Hassall,
of Denbigh (Cobbitty), the
“Galloping Parson, - ’ whose
parish stretched to the South
Pole.
Now the original shingle
roof, which was covered many
years ago with corrugated-iron,
is rotten and leaking badly.
So much water-damage is being
done to the church that a new
roof is urgently needed. Archi-
tectural experts have advised
that this should be of charcoal-
colored concrete tiles which
would harmonise well with the
honey-colored sandstone.
“The cost of this new roof
will be at least £600,” says the
Rev. John F. S. Campbell, act-
ing-rector.
It is a large sum for the
Mulgoa parishioners' to pro-
vide; but surely little enough
for motorists visiting the area
(and the church) to find
amongst themselves over a few
weekends. (Cheques, incident-
ally, should be sent to the St.
Thomas’s Mulgoa Building
Fund, The Rectory, Mulgoa,
N.S.W.).
In the churchyard at Mulgoa
are buried several Coxes,
Nathaniel Norton of Fairlignt,
Surveyor-General Allister Mac-
lean, and many others. Early
parishioners were Gregory
Blaxland, the Lethbridges, the
Kings and, of course, Sir John
Jamison,


POLITICAL PONTS
Having formed Seato to protect the
South-east Asian countries, it is now
proposed to form Neato —Japan, South
Korea, Formosa and the Philippines -
to guarantee the North. Unfortunately,
judging by the proceedings of U.N., the
only body with real potency is Veto.

Student pranks are usually viewed
with tolerance in Sydney as in most
cities, and although student humor is
rarely as witty as its perpetrators
imagine it to be allowance is made for
youthful exuberance. Every now and
then, however, high spirits and so-called
ingenuity go too far. There was nothing
amusing or clever in the removal (with
accompanying damage) of the sculptured
mermaid from the rocks at Bondi.
Vandalism is the only word for it, and
the young men responsible would do
themselves and Sydney University more
credit if, instead of pluming themselves
on the engineering prowess displayed in
hacking it from its base, they put their
brains to work to meet the cost of
restoring or replacing it.

Allan Dalziel, secretary and confidante
to Dr. Evatt while leader of the Federal
Labor party, says of the new leader,
Calwell, and his deputy, Whitlam:
They want to be loved by the enemies

as they reach out in a pathetic attempt to
gain the spoils of office.
Well, he should know; but they
seem to have strange ways of going
about it.

At the conclusion of his visit to Papua
Indonesian Ambassador Helmi com-
mented that Australia was doing an
excellent job in the way of preparing the
people of New Guinea for eventual self-
government, but he warned that world
opinion might force Australia to grant
independence before the people were
ready for it. He assessed the situation
pretty well when he said that as more and
more African colonies became independ-
ent there would be more pressure on
Australia over New Guinea and that “if
you speed-up independence you will get
undesirable results.”
The customary attitude of Indonesia
and most Asian countries has been that
every colonial territory should be given
independence immediately, little regard
being given to the stage of development
of individual territories, or their fitness
for self-government.
It is difficult not to think that Dr.
Helmi’s thoughts were on the Dutch end
of the island rather than the Australian.
Before the end of the year Papuans will
be in the majority in the Legislative
Council of Dutch New Guinea, which
will put them closer to independence than
the natives in the Australian territories.
Indonesia wants to incorporate West New
Guinea into its island empire without
any intention of ever granting self-
determination.

In the debate on the off-course tote

The Labor Opposition, which in the

off-course tote bill because it did not
provide for cash betting and was now

T abor’s pet plan for a Greater Sydney
' in which the whole of the metropoli-
tan area would be under the control of
one big council has been dragged out of
cold-storage again. Feelers are out for
a kind of half-way stage with the City
of Sydney swallowing half-a-dozen other
municipalities, North Sydney, Mosman
and Willoughby being merged into one
and Manly being married to Warringah
Shire. Several of the councils involved
were marked for extinction in the 1947
orgy of amalgamations, but they cam-
paigned strenuously and saved their
bacon. It looks as if they’ll have to fight
the battle all over again.
Opposition-leader Askin says that if
Heffron goes ahead with the plan the
Liberal party will pledge itself to re-
verse the legislation if returned to office
at the next election.

Queensland Opposition-leader Duggan
had a rowdy meeting when he delivered
the A.L.P. policy-speech in Brisbane on
Wednesday night. He devoted much of
his speech to criticism of the failures and
shortcomings of the Nicklin Government,
which he accused of breaking 14 elec-
tion-pledges. A eulogy on the work of
past Labor Governments brought him
the reminder from the audience that
“that was under Gair.”
Chief points of his own programme
were better schools, a higher school-
leaving age (15, to be raised later to 16),
restoration of the “high standard of free
hospitalisation that prevailed before the
advent of the present Government,” a
State bank, three weeks annual-leave (the
issue on which the Gair Government
fell), equal pay for women and a 35-hour
week (as an objective). Nothing to set
the Brisbane River on fire or to fill the
electorate with enthusiasm for a Duggan-
led A.L.P. Government.
Calwell gave the meeting his blessing,
his presence and some light entertain-
ment, but as he has helped lead Federal
Labor in five consecutive defeats, his
appearance on the platform could
scarcely be taken as an omen of victory.

Fidel Castro has nominated his

a mad nation that wanted the responsi-

of economic and political chaos.
THE BREATH OF SPRING


It’s an old saying that distant fields
appear more green,„ but according to
a member of the South Australian Legis-
lative Council an Adelaide estate-agent
has been making sure his fields still look
green when viewed close-up. The M.L.C.
claims that this enterprising bloke
sprayed green dye on the sand and dead
vegetation of sandhill subdivisions he was
trying to sell on the coast south of
Adelaide. Probably the agent was merely
trying to make the land look like the
pictures the commercial artists had drawn
for his advertisements.

Albert Monk is the latest in the field

should it? The law is there to be
enforced, but the A.C.T.U. believes that
it should be enforced only against one
side. Monk threatens employers and
courts with “serious consequences.”

“Mugga Way”: Nasser's men made a
fearful mess of the Anzac Memorial at
Port Said in 1956, and the bronze
statuary group, now at Albany (W.A.),

damaged, and the base is badly distorted.
Melbourne sculptor Raymond Ewers
doubts if the group can be repaired, and
has suggested it should be remade. The
original miniature model is held by the
Australian War Memorial in Canberra,
and a new full-scale model can be made
from this, for casting here or, if neces-
sary, in Europe. It is intended that the
complete memorial will be erected on
Mt. Clarence, overlooking the Sound
from which the First Contingent sailed
in 1914.

In the 20 years to 1958-59, direct taxes
in Australia rose by 1203 per cent., taking
nine per cent, of the total income, com-
pared with 4.6 per cent, in 1938-39.
Still, savings have increased from
5.1 p.c. of the income after taxation to
8.5 p.c. These figures were produced by
Melbourne “Herald” Research, which
also announces, with some fanfare, that
Victorians are the wealthiest people in
Australia, with an average income of
£499 a head compared with £497 in
N.S.W. and an Australian average
of £4BO.
Considering the long-held belief that
Melbourne is the financial centre of
Australia and the recent phenomenal
growth of the Victorian capital and
some of its satellites, the £2 a head by
which Victoria has pipped N.S.W. is
surprisingly small.

/Communists are certainly busy in this
country. First Victorian Railways
were disrupted—the A.R.U. has a Federal
Communist control seated in Victoria.
Next W. Parkinson took a hand to pro-
duce a strike in coal. Then the seamen
burst out in lawlessness and rowdyism
and defiance of the courts. And last
week the wharfies, having been fined
£5OO for contempt of court, decided to
throw all ports idle in protest.
All this is in line with the presages of
the Tokyo transport conference organised
a few months ago by the Communist
W.F.T.U. and attended by Australian
delegates. And it might prove curiously
apposite to Russian proceedings when
the history of 1960 is written.

Sir Garfield Barwick’s latest bill pro-
vides a penalty of a £5OO fine or two
years’ jail for illegally tapping a tele-
phone or retailing information gained by
legal telephone-tapping. Some Opposi-
tion members will pass this blithely with
clear consciences: they get their infor-
mation about their enemies by clairvoy-

Dan Curtin could have known (if they
did) that Menzies had promised an
appointment on the Arbitration Court

Burns Commission. It is proposed that
the Fijians (42 per cent, of the popula-
tion) should be encouraged to enter com-
mercial life, and make their own con-
tribution to the economic development
of the island. There are also proposals
for improved distribution of land among
the 374,000 population, and for the
strengthening of present industries and
the introduction of new ones. Cost of all
recommendations would be nearly

balance. Overseas loans raised totalled
£42 million, “the best result since the

Treasurer Holt. “Best” is perhaps not
the most appropriate word in this con-
text, but at least it is nice to know that

“Joanne”: Newcastle City Council is
in a quandary over a bequest by the late
William Longworth, local businessman
and philanthropist. He left the Long-
worth Institute, in Scott Street, in the
hands of trustees to be administered as
an art-gallery, herbarium and meeting-
place for cultural and patriotic groups.
Now the trustees have died, and the
building isn’t being used for these pur-
poses. The council wants to put the
institute to a use in harmony with the
spirit of the bequest and the Local
Government Department has told it that
the property can be resumed for a
nominal sum. So far so good ; but the
Crown Law authorities have ruled that
this can’t be done unless the building
is required for some purposes associated
with council activities. Lord Mayor
Purdue, who is also Independent M.L.A.
for Waratah, is considering a special Par-
liamentary bill to enable the city to give
effect to its wishes.

A.L.P. executive has said officially that
the Communists engage in propaganda
for the “sole purpose of defeating the

of a foreign Power,” it shows how far
Labor is prepared to go to record its dis-

“5X5960”: The passing of Lt.-Col.
H. G. Loveband (B. 27/4/’6O) brings
back memories of his service as Q.M.
of the 2/7th Field Regiment, R.A.A.
Everybody knew “Lofty,” and everybody
liked him. A big man, he carried himself well
and looked exactly what he was —a tine
Regular soldier. But there was a genial air
about him, so that nobody ever felt that they
were faced by unyielding regimentality, and his
reproofs, though they went home, were always
tempered with good humor. There are many
stories about “Lofty” Loveband, most of them
funny and all kindly. He didn’t put-up his
War I ribbons until the transport was safely
out of Fremantle on the way to the M.E., when
no base-wallah could inquire too closely into
his age. (He wasn’t alone in that—the Regi-
ment also had “Saltbush” from Ist A.L.H.,
and “Whiskers” from the Camel Corps.)
My own favorite story about him concerns


the time in 1941, when the regiment was
stationed near Buq-Buq, where, incidentally,
he made a gallant attempt in very rough seas
to rescue a drowning soldier from the
Mediterranean.
Our Ford one-tonner “Survey 2,” with a
five-man crew of regimental surveyors on
board, had gone out on. a night job beyond
the F.D.L.s and been put out of action by
running over a mine. Nobody was hurt, and
the crew got home safely by walking carefully
in the vehicle-tracks. “Survey 2” was left in
the middle of a minefield, which in daylight
was covered by enemy guns, and couldn’t be
salvaged, so the Survey crew were told to
put in a kit-shortage report. This was too
good a chance to miss, so naturally the whole
party, regardless of whether they rode in
“Survey 2” or not, put in for everything they’d
lost in the last year or so. When the list
was presented to “Lofty” he hit the roof.
“A bloody three-tonner couldn’t have carried
that lot,” he roared, “but it’s a good story.
I'll pay it.”
Vale, “Lofty.”

About 10 years ago the role of
trouble-shooting foreman in the circus-
film “The Greatest Show On Earth”
went to a tall, powerfully-built young
actor with a jutting jaw, high cheek-
bones and piercing eyes set deep under
bushy brows. This proved a shrewd pick
by the casting-director, for that foreman
fairly exuded an air of easy authority
and restrained strength; and it was
patent that “strong” roles would come,
his way. Charlton Heston has been doing
such roles ever since, so convincingly
that, just as he was the obvious choice
to play Moses in “The Ten Command-
ments” made by Cecil de Mille, he was
also a monte for the title-part of “Ben-
Hur” when director William Wyler put
General Lew Wallace’s Biblical epic on
the stocks —the role that won Heston
his Oscar for the best actor of last year.
Now in Australia as guest of Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer, the studio that made
the film, for personal appearances at
OSCAR
charity - previews, he hailed originally
from Illinois and is a university-
graduate of easy and fluent conversation,
his geniality still undented even after a
battery of sob-sisters had done him over
at the Sydney cocktail-party where Lahm
got this impression of him.

parents, he served in the Zulu War of
1879, and in the Boer War. He walked
about half-a-mile from Linkside Rest

afterwards, as guest-of-honor at the
R.S.L. luncheon, responded to the toast.

Former Sydney policeman Ken Neate
turned-up in Melbourne to rehearse in
a hurry for the leading role in the
Elizabethan Trust Opera Co.’s produc-

his return he had been singing with the
Strasbourg Opera.
John Brownlee encouraged Ken Neate
to study overseas, and in 1940 he went
to the U.S., since Europe was at war,
but his bank was light, and when it
petered-out he joined the Royal Canadian
Air Force, with a bomber's job.
Although his home' is now in Paris,
he was a ranking singer at Covent Gar-
den for five years. His tenor will be
heard in “The Magic Flute” as well as
“Butterfly” during the Sydney and Bris-
bane seasons.

“P.J.G.”: Last met in London, where
he was U.K. and European rep. for
8.C.P.A., working in an office near Vic-
toria air-terminal and based on a com-
fortable home in Dulwich Village, Ben
Cochrane is certainly what used to be
called “air-minded.” After years of
globetrotting, which included six return-
trips between Australia and London and
more than 40 different places of abode,
he’s now Queensland manager for T.A.A.
Sketched above, Cochrane was born in
Sydney, studied pharmacy at Sydney
University, and ran his own business
for three years until joining the A.A.M.C.
on the outbreak of War 11. Afterwards
he joined Qantas, opened offices for them
at Townsville and Perth and had an
eight-month spell as manager in New
Guinea. His first overseas move came
when he went to Ceylon to establish a
Qantas office in association with
8.0.A.C. Back in Australia he had some
dabbling with imports and exports and
another go at pharmacy ; but by now
the air had really got him. He became
an early T.A.A. traffic-superintendent in
N.S.W., was later assistant-manager and
airport-manager, transferred in 1949 to
B.C.P.A. for his job in London, was
back in Australia in 1955 as Australian

traffic- and sales-manager for T.A.A.,
based on Melbourne, and took-up the

Major the Hon. Robert Lindsay, Scots Greys.
In War I, as a memorial to her husband, she
turned her London home into the Robert
Lindsay Officers’ Hospital—the first privately-
run hospital in the war. She made her home
in Westralia in 1926, breeding Clydesdales,
Hungarian ponies and sheep.
In Sydney, at 71, Leopold John Simonson,
managing-director of M. Simonson (Sydney)
Pty., Ltd. He was bom in Victoria, and was
old enough to appreciate the aftermath, in
suburban Melbourne, of the economic crisis
of 1893. As a youth he went on the land, then
joined the family business. A good mixer and
a keen golfer, he was a member of Roseville,
Elanora and Killara clubs, as well as of
Bowral.
In Sydney, at 55, Victor Charles Bradman,
brother of Sir Donald. On the board of the
Berrima District Hospital for more than 12
years until 1957, he had been hon. treasurer
for 10 years, and was also a Mittagong shire-
councillor and in 1954-55 shire-president, as
well as having been for 17 years president of
the Berrima District Tennis Association.
In Melbourne, at 80, Ernest J. L. Bremner,
who crossed from New Zealand as an engineer
in 1900, became inspector of gold-dredging in
n.-e. Victoria, sales-manager of the Morwell
State colliery and later consultant-engineer of
Australian Portland' Cement. Father of one
of the Australian stage’s most charming musi-
comedy stars, Marie Bremner.
In Mornington (Vic.), at 66, Baden Arthur
Morris, a Victorian State Electricity Com-
missioner since 1957. A consulting-engineer
and also farmer, he was a Digger of both wars.
In Sydney, at 78, Thomas Joseph Lawlor,
musician, bibliophile and photographer. Noted
as a pianist in many parts of the world, he
finally settled in Sydney as an orchestral
conductor. His photographs of Sydney, Can-
berra and of his home-town of Wellington
(N.Z.) were widely known, and he had just
completed a history of photography at the time
of his death.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Yes, it may be a parrot-fish, but it can't talk.
Tn our far - northern town the same
people comprise most of the com-
mittees, including those of the Inland
Mission and Turf Club. A certain
liberality of outlook allows the organist
to place a casual 10 - bob on the
favorite on Saturdays provided he is
there with the goods at early service
on Sunday mornings, but the real cream
was skimmed by the onlookers when the
chairman got his notes mixed at the
annual meeting: “Now, ladies and
gentlemen, I think three-hundred pounds
would be a suitable donation —no. No,
that is the Turf Club, of course. In this
case, seeing that it’s the Mission, perhaps
five pounds would be a suitable amount.”
And later on: “At our meeting next
Saturday-week no less than seven clergy-
men will be present, and” —turning over
a page —“your committee has been able
to arrange for twelve bookmakers to
field Excuse me ; I must have missed
a page there somehow.” —“Benbow.”

“Q. Ree” (Fiji): The very hot cus-
tomer, his shirt sodden with perspiration,
came into the Indian barber’s. The
barber gesticulated at the shirt and at
the chair. The Fijian took off his shirt,
wrung it out at the door, dried himself
with it, and sat in the chair in just his
shorts, and had a haircut.

“Crow Eater”: Visitors to S.A. travel-
ing along the Mount Barker Road will
miss an old familiar landmark —it was
known by everyone as the Big Gum
Tree, and stood opposite St. Saviour’s
Church at Glen Osmond. But age, and
especially the ravages of borers, had
made it a hazard, and the Minister of
Roads has been forced to order the axe,
“with sincere regret.” Seeds from the
old-timer were obtained before execu-
tion-day, and these are to be planted at
suitable spots along the Mount Barker
Road. It is likely that a commemorative
plaque will also be erected close to the
Big Gum Tree site.

“Barwon”: “Amdee” (B. 20/4/’6O)
can tell the marines that danger from
falling coconuts is negligible. On
Morotai in 1945 some of us were housed
in tents set over inch-thick board floors
raised about Ift. above the ground. A
fair-sized ’nut fell one night, pierced the
tent, went straight through the boards,
leaving a rather neat hole, and then
buried itself to ground-level in the earth.
For some hours afterward the sleeper

THE SERMON OF THE BIRDS
[As narrated by Alexander Vesper]
[Alexander Vesper is a caste-aborigine ot
the Gullivul tribe of the Casino-Lismore-
Kyogle district of N. S. Wales. He is the
best narrator and repository of the mythology,
tribal life, religion and lore of the aborigines
I have encountered / in this State. He is 70
years of age, upright and able-bodied. He
scorns the pension and still works at bush-
work: fencing, clearing, etc., for which he
is well-known in the district. He will point-
out to you the fences and stockyards he has
built. ' /
I believe that, in other circumstances, Alex
would have been a great story-teller and poet.
He must certainly be descended from an
aboriginal poet. Taking down a story from
I was clearing thirty or forty acres once
out in the western range near Nightcap
Mountain.
And as I was working l heard a gathering
of crows
singing out in a jungle gully. Their
clamorous cries
drawed the attention of all the other
birds.
Jackass and butcher-bird, soldier-bird,
sparrow-bird,
scrub-robin, magpie, the black and the
white cockatoo, *
they all flew down to the crows in the
jungle-gully.
And l followed after their clamor, and
in the midst
of all the splendid excitement of the birds
I heard one feller was singing above them
all.
It was the lyrebird, the mimic of all the ‘
scrub.
And they held this beautiful sermon for
half an hour.
him is an easy matter. His language Is ft
glorious mixture of precept, imagery and
cadence from the English Bible and aboriginal
oral literature. He is deeply religious in both
these sources and will not be parted from
a leather-bound, tattered old Authorised
Version of the Bible which he carries with
him and from which he preaches and illustrates
his discourse. At the recent conference on
the aborigines, held at Newport, Sydney, Alex
spoke for “The redemption of my people.”
Striding up and down, waving his Bible, he
delivered himself like a fiery Isaiah. The poem
is an example of his narrations which, I feel,
in other circumstances, he would have put into
verse himself.—R. R.]
The birds would stop and listen a while,
but still
that beautiful voice, the lyrebird, would
keep on singing
and draw them and join them all to a
chorus again.
And as 1 stood there and listened, the
Scriptures was
hitting me all the time. That sermon
seemed
like the prophecy when Christ shall come
and summon
the birds, the valleys and hills, the moun-
tains and ocean
to sing in praise of the grace and the
reckoning day,
and the beauty of earth in the splendor
that He created.
And I went back and told my people of
what / had seen,
and the sermon of praise I heard in the
mountain range.

suffered recurrent bouts of the ducks-
and-drakes every time the gap in the
boards crossed his vision, and for the
rest of his service on the island applauded
the efforts of the Jap p.-0.-w. who re-
luctantly climbed the trees to cut the
bunches away with machetes. As the
sleeper concerned, I’m still slightly
coconut-happy after 15 years of the
comparable peace-time hazards of street-
crossing, refereeing football and driving
on Sunday afternoons.

“Murray Swagman”: The bloke who
wanted an eggcup because he needed
something to bathe his finger in (B.
30/3/’6O) reminds me of the chap who
cut a hole 18in.-square in the paling-
fence of the yard. This enabled the
kelpie bitch to get out for exercise, but
stopped the cows getting into the yard.
When the bitch had pups, it became
necessary to have an outlet the pups
could get through, so he cut a smaller
hole about Bin.-square.
* * * *
“Brick E”: Our early Australian
builders knew that slate or marble made
durable and attractive thresholds at front
and back doorways ; but those materials
were imported and expensive, so sand-
stone was often used as a substitute.
Today in scores of old houses may be
seen doorsteps that have been hollowed
to convexity by nothing more than the
daily passage of bootleather across them.
More recent years brought concrete and
terrazzo, and, with the object-lesson of
the older buildings, no experienced,
conscientious builder would use sand-
stone for doorsteps. Then came the
modernist. Today, some of the younger
architects are specifying as a feature in
their upper - bracket homes sandstone
thresholds! Experience teaches; but
apparently it only teaches two genera-
tions. The third has to learn it all over
again.
* * * *
“Hinemoa”: Totara-trees with girths
up to 24ft. have recently been dug out
of volcanic-ash which resulted from the
eruption of New Zealand’s Mt. Tarawera
74 years ago. The timber is in sound
condition, and Maori craftsmen are now
transforming some of it into carvings
for a new meeting-house being erected
at Lake Rotoiti, near Rotorua.
* * * *
“Sevenelms”: The kookaburra is
usually solitary in foraging unless some
dramatic tocsin, such as a loudly falling
tree or crackling bushfire, summons the
mob to a galaxy of grub. Vocally he
does perform solo, but in duet or trio
really makes the welkin ring. In late
dusk the kookaburras separately wing-in
back to camp with beaks ajar already
flexing vocal cords with bass chuckles.
Then comes the chorus, not of strident
individual cachinnations, but a blending
of parts to compose a melodious and
haunting Last Post. With due respect to
artistic licence, may we note that old
brushback has appeared lately in The
Bulletin in odd poses. He cannot sing
except when his open throat is aimed
almost vertically skyward and his tail-
piece jaunted 45 degrees to his base line
of perch, and when perched his ample
waistcoat will overlap his landing-gear.

“Bowra”: The newly-formed Cunna-
mulla Historical Society is seeking early
records and stories of the early days of
South-western Queensland. Instead of
burning old papers, diaries and records,
persons in possession could send them to
the society for indexing and storage.
The wishes of donors to restrict public
access will be strictly observed.

“Laetitia”: I was idly throwing scraps
of my lunch to a solid 9in. lizard, and
with each of my shortened casts it was
becoming more venturesome. Came the
stage when, to reach the latest titbit, it
“ Where's the fire?”
had to cross a pile of dead twigs. As
it did so there was a scurry in the twigs.
The forager appeared to rise and quiver
in the air for about two seconds, then
flop dead, and I saw that it was held
in the clamped jaws of a middle-sized
death-adder. After killing the deadly one
I found that all the scales on the lizard
had been disturbed, and that cause of
death was a broken spine. Goes to show
the snapping-power of the adder’s jaws,
which had to be distended to their limit
to grasp the victim’s belly.
* * * *
“Miss M.”: The spotted-pardalote,
lately on the wing in these pages, is
sometimes called diamond-bird, dyke
or ground-diamond, but, as it isn’t a
finch, there’s no justification for call-
ing it “diamond-sparrow.” The bird com-
monly so-called (with Cayley’s blessing)
is that strikingly handsome finch, often
seen in aviaries, with the brilliantly-red
rump and broad black band across his
white weskit. Also known as Java-
sparrow or diamond-firetail, he nests in
low scrub or bushes (thorny for choice),
and occasionally in odd corners of that
massive pile of sticks that an eagle calls
home. He may often be seen around
the nesting-area at other than breeding-
seasons. Where his range extends far
inland, to parts where summers are long
and spring seasons often dry, he follows
local bird-custom and nests according td
rainfall rather than time of year. Little
or no nesting takes place during a
drought, but. good rain in February-
March, with ensuing plenitude of food,
may result in a breeding-season lasting
all autumn.

“Rangitaiki”: Here’s one armchair-
expert whose efforts aren’t to be sneezed
at. A Bay of Islands (N.Z.) man, his
home is 200 ft. back and 100 ft. above a
channel. He fixed a stout post at the
water's edge, connected to his house by
a wire, on which a pulley runs. His line
runs through the pulley, with sinker,
trace and hook hanging free. The weight
of the pulley carries the tackle to the
post, and down goes the sinker. Hauling
up a fish brings the pulley back to the
starting-point again. Anglers may snort,
but this one does get fish.

Sevenelms : Surely Gravelsnatcher
*6/3/ 60) would not expect us to
t^iat ca£ hiP u J, the name of a
Moluccan oil-tree known to Far East
commerce for 1000 years, and even to
Europe for 250 years, would be in any
Australian tribe’s vocabulary other than
through contact with Malay or Chinese
traders! The implication was so obvious
that I didn’t bother stating it. Durable
bentwood boat-knees are valued by any
seagoing people, and the brown tea-tree
is plenty bendy. Malays for centuries
came and got them, or traded for them,
from Australian coasts, and so the
aborigines would acquire the word. I
don’t think it’s an abo. word in any
dialect—and that’s what I said.


An old Thursday Island dweller,
told me how he and his mates
put an end to the myalls’ pillaging of
their stores during a trepanging venture
on Arnhem Land. One night, knowing
they would be waiting handy in the
scrub, he mixed a lot of carbide with
the wet beach-sand near the lean-to in
which supplies were stored. Then, stand-
ing in the centre of the gas-impregnated
circle, he dropped a match, thus illumi-
ning himself against the tropic darkness.
“The effect was so startling,” he told
me, “that it even scared me mate a bit.
The yells from the boongs as they lit-out
were blood-curdling, and we didn’t see
’em again.”—“Stultus.”

“Q. Ree”: There are no “wee beasties”
—except perhaps hornets—in the Fijian
canefields, and the cane isn’t fired, as in
Australia, before cutting. Burnt cane is
paid for at a lower rate than unburnt
cane —in fact, one way of scoring off
an enemy is to throw a few lighted
matches into his canefield.
* * * *
“D.P.L.”: A bushman once told me
that black-cockatoos always flew in odd
numbers. Over the years I have found
this true on too many occasions to be
mere coincidence. Anyone struck the
same oddity?
* * * *
“Stromlo”: Sydney papers published
photos taken the first day of a baby
rhino, born at Taronga Park, and one
announced confidently that the babe
weighed a mere 901 b. How was that
figure assessed? Mumma would certainly
have destroyed any reporter or zoo
official who tried to get the youngster
on the scales. The theory is that the
infant was photographed at long range,
and then viewed by an expert through
binoculars and pronounced normal. The
textbooks disclosed that an average
baby rhino, weighed 901 b. at birth, so
putting two and two together they
made 90.
* * * *
“Wandana”: I had always thought
that the “ ’Ghan” express, running on
the North - South railway, got its name
because of the number of Afghans
located round Marree in earlier days.
Another version has just reached me,
though: that really its title was the
Gahan express, named after the first
Commonwealth Railways Commissioner.
Various writers have associated it with
the turbaned camel-riding brigade once
so familiar. Which origin is correct?
* * * *
“Spin”: Birds fly astonishing distances
for water. One Centralian bird
is reputed to fly 200 miles for a drink
each day; and although I’d have to see
that proved I’d credit some birds with
flights of 100 miles. A Westralian
naturalist who studied bird-movement at
Queen Victoria Spring, in sandhill coun-
try north of the Nullarbor Plain, arrived
"No, Tim—I'm just window-shopping."
at a time when the soak was dry and
saw budgerigars passing it and heading
south. As the nearest known water was
at Zanthus, 40 miles south, it was
assumed the birds had that much further
to fly on top of the distance they’d
already travelled. That’s being repeated
daily all over the “dead heart.” Any
detailed account of desert-exploration in
Australia reveals that although the party
may at times go for days or weeks with-
out striking water, there's seldom a day
passes without a report of a bird being
sighted. Granted that birds and animals
will find water where most humans
won’t but my point is that, although
there are huge inland areas where you
could be pretty certain there’s no water,
there are very few places in Australia
where there are no birds. Even birds
which make best use of dews must some-
times travel far for a drink.

“Yeno Ham”: At least one magpie
at Orange (N.S.W.) is keeping up with
progress. A member of the local model-
aircraft club was demonstrating his
radio-controlled craft when mag. stepped
on the gas and joined in, keeping within
a few feet of it until it glided-in. Maggie
made a perfect two-point landing beside
it a few seconds later.

Up at the top of Yorke Peninsula
(S.A.) Kadina and Wallaroo are
making preparations to celebrate the
centenary of the discovery of copper
thereabouts. Half-q-century ago the
district carried four newspapers to cater
for the thriving community—Moonta’s
“People’s Weekly,” the “Kadina and
Wallaroo Times,” Kadina’s “Plain
Dealer” and the “Yorke’s Peninsula
Advertiser,” employing a vigorous style
of journalism. Those were the days when
you hadn’t travelled unless you’d been
“up t’ Monta,’’ had seen the well-kept
cemetery where Courting couples paraded
along the tombstone-walks on Sundays,
or had met “Cap’n Handcock,” regarded
by Cornish compatriots with a degree
of reverence somewhat higher than
accorded the reigning sovereign.
Another notability I recall was “Jimmy
from Heaven,” who generally wore a
Beaufort coat and a long beard, and who
made valiant but vain efforts year after
year to obtain a Parliamentary seat. The
“Cousin Jacks” whom Oswald Pryor
portrays faithfully in his Bulletin
sketches were great musicians and
vocalists, and brass-bands and choirs
flourished. Mining has been very quiet
up Wallaroo way for a good many years,
however, and oldsters are bringing out
their old photos and other relics for the
Adelaide Department of Mines, which
will be staging a special display of the
“copper-towns.”
South Australia, by the way, was the
first of the Australian colonies to make
mining history, when silver-lead lodes
were found in 1838 about four miles
east of Adelaide in the hills round Glen
Osmond ; the first shipment of silver-lead
ore went away somewhere' about 1841.
In 1844 one John Hill ran the Miners’
Arms, advertised as a “new and delight-
ful domicile,” where there was a good
larder and indispensable liquid require-
ments, and from which visitors could
visit the Glen Osmond Wheal Gawler
and Wheal Watkins mines nearby. To-
day the old mine-shafts and tunnels are
used for wine-storage.

THE L. J. HOOKER EMPIRE
/“\n evidence of the latest
L. J. Hooker takeover,
Mr. Hooker seems to have
immense faith in the future.
And Mr. Multi-millionaire
Buckland seems to have im-
mense faith in Mr. Hooker.
From a small estate-agency
at Maroubra Junction, Sydney,
32 years ago, Leslie J. Hooker
now directs the biggest real-
estate organisation in the Com-
monwealth (annual turnover in
excess of £2O million), and it is
now about to acquire the
largest cattle-station in Aus-
tralia —Victoria River Downs
—plus a string of other proper-
ties in the N.T., W.A., Queens-
land, N.S.W. and Victoria, in
all aggregating more than
11,000 square-miles.
The big station and stud-
property deal is with William
L. Buckland, of Melbourne,
and his associated cos. Kanim-
bla Hall, a block of 104 flats
in Potts Point, Sydney, is
included in the transaction.
No substantial new cash is
required to finance the huge
deal, though a figure of £5.7
million has been placed on the
properties. Nor will a share-
placement be immediately
necessary.
The takeover will be effected
on July 1, and a cash payment
of £1 million is then to be
made. But in the taken-over
cos. there is substantial cash
in hand, as well as profits
accruing, and these items, Mr.
Hooker says, will provide most
of the million.
The balance of the considera-
tion is being satisfied by giving
Mr. Buckland the right to take-
up (and pay for in cash at ss.
a share) 5,000,000 Hooker
shares in July, 1967, and
3,000,000 in Jqly, 1968.
On exercising these options
(which are said to have been
valued for the purposes of the
deal at 11s. 6d. each) the
Buckland interests will sub-
scribe £2 million to the Hooker
capital in cash.
These unusual and ingeni-
ous terms of sale mean that
the Hooker organisation will
have the income of the proper-
ties for from eight to nine
years before having to meet
dividends on the £2 million
allotment of shares.
Hooker’s have already used
the “options” method of
finance, and there are 3,428,158
“You don't have to smile at the camera."
of these floating round, as well
as over 7,500,000 ss. ords.
TI/Hen all the options are
exercised, including the
latest issue, Mr. Hooker says
that paid capital (without,
apparently, taking into account
the Royal Exchange deal, now
in the course of completion)
will be £5.7 million in 1968,
plus whatever other capital-
expansion takes place in the
meantime. The current 20
p.c. div.-rate would call for
£1,140,000 on that figure. Mr.
Hooker is confident that, “with
a continuance of the present
economic climate,” the divi-
dend will be comfortably
covered.
By far the biggest and most
spectacular takeover yet
attempted by the Hooker
organisation (Victoria River
Downs is a long way from
Maroubra Junction), the beef-
cattle deal follows closely on
the offer by Hooker’s for the
shares in Sydney Exchange Co.,
Ltd., at a price of £625,000
payable in cash or shares at
the option of the different
vending shareholders. A big
modern hotel is to be put up
on the Wool Exchange site,
while reserving space for the
continuance of wool-auctions.
Other recent activities within
the Hooker group include the
purchase of several Sydney
properties in the vinicity of
Angel Place, Ash Street and
Pitt Street, comprising a large
area in the heart of the city.
At the end of March
Hooker’s also acquired a 75 p.c.
interest in G. H. Thomas Pty.,
Ltd., builder, of Parramatta
and Wollongong, for £380,000,
of which £87,520 was payable
in cash and the balance in
221,100 Hooker ss. shares. The
Thomas concern is a modernly
equipped, large-scale home-
building contractor now build-
ing 1000 homes a year, and
being geared to produce 2000.
Apart from these takeovers
and projected deals, the Hooker
organisation comprises:
L. J. Hooker, Ltd. (the real-
estate co.), which has been expand-
ing rapidly by takeovers of small
suburban real-estate concerns and
by opening its own branches in
N.S.W., Queensland and Victoria.
Hooker-Rex Co., Ltd., engaged
in the subdivision and development
of metropolitan and seaside estates,
including areas on the Queensland
Gold Coast and at Headland
Heights (Sydney North Shore). It
is also interested in regional
shopping-centres and home-units.
Rex Investments, Ltd., operat-
ing a chain of a dozen or so hotels
in Sydney, Potts Point, Canberra
and St. Marys. All have the name
Rex in their titles.
Hooker Finance Co., Ltd.,
formed in 1959 to finance the pur-
chase of real-estate, especially
finance for the small-home or home-
unit purchaser. This co. is to be
expanded and listed on ’Change,
the parent retaining a 45 p.c.
interest.
Australian Landtrusts Pty.,
Ltd., the pioneer landtrust pro-
-moter in Australia, which, since
business commenced on July 6,
1959, has been doing a very brisk
business.
Mainguard (Australia), Ltd.,
was bought as a realisation/pro-
position, but it still has several
operative projects, including Festi-
val Records Pty., Solar Salt, Ltd.,
Capricorn Freezers Pty. and R. N.
Hoskins Pty.
Accommodation Australia, Ltd.,
operating several motels in N.S.W.
and the A.C.T. It is planned to
have 12 motels operating by the
end of 1960, and sites for others
are being acquired.
Constructors (Engineering and
Industrial), Ltd., acquired partly
for the tax value of its losses. Its
name has been changed to Town
and Country Development, Ltd.
City Investments, Ltd., a Bris-
bane real-estate investment co.
acquired this year.
Australian Wool Brokers and
Produce Co., Ltd.* owning sheep
properties in N.S.W.
C.G.A. Fire and Accident
Insurance Co., Ltd., of which
Hooker’s will own 50 p.c. of the
£650,000 of paid capital and most
of the balance will be subscribed
by Sydney Guarantee Corporation,
Ltd. (This is not a Hooker sub-
sidiary, but an investment.)
During the year to June 30,
1959, consolidated net profit
of the L. J. Hooker Invest-
ment Corp. group was
£266,923, equal to 32.2 p.c. on
average ord. capital.
(Paid capital at June 30 last
was £1,056,197, of which
£20,000 was pref., the rest ord.
By March this year it had
grown to £1,612,822, with
400,000 options to convert into
ss. ords. on July 31 this year
still outstanding, and 3,028,158
to convert in July, 1964. Apart
from the Sydney Exchange and
the Buckland cattle-empire
takeovers, it has increased
further since the March total.
Nominal capital is to be raised
from £5 million to £2O million.)
■pOR the past three years L. J.
■*- Hooker Investment Corp.
has paid a 20 p.c. div., and
interim for the current term is
at that rate. Consolidated re-
serves at June 30, 1958, were
mainly those derived from
takeovers, and a year later the
principal reserve was one of
£1,167,136 resulting from

asset-revaluation. Total re-
serves at June 30, 1959, were
£1,586,568. At that stage the
group had £3,099,732 of
borrowed funds and other
creditors of £858,158.
Following announcement of
the Buckland takeover L. J.
Hooker ss. shares sold at 265.
6d. Purchase at this figure
gives a return of 3.8 p.c. on a
20 p.c. div. basis. One thing
necessary to maintenance of a
20 p.c. dividend, and to ultimate
improvement, will depend on
the management seeing to it
that there is not, in any year,
too much “dead” property on
hand, not yielding income
while it is being remodelled
or rebuilt, and at the same
time costing the co. interest
or dividends.
The employment of
“options” in takeover trans-
actions has done a lot to over-
come this possibility, though
the method could also tend to
over-glamorise earnings tem-
porarily if new assets become
fully reproductive before the
options are taken-up.
The toast to Hooker’s in
their large new ventures is:
“Good luck—and good diges-
tion ! ”
Active But Selective
A ustralian sharcmarkets
have again been busy, but
a more discriminating approach
is being adopted by investors.
Although record prices con-
tinue to be paid for stocks
which are known to be making
increasing profits and to be ex-
panding (or diversifying) their
activities, the market still looks
hard at anything that has a
doubt about it, and for this
reason continues to be a bit
sceptical about textiles, al-
though the woollen group now
seems to be doing better. An
exception has been the case of
John Vicars’s £1 shares, which,
since they were pointed out in
B. 16/3/’6O at 255. have moved
up to 295. 6d. Shares in Taub-
man’s, the paint people, have
continued to be depressed
around 10s. and to yield over
6 p.c.
The Sydney construction
and/or real-estate groups have
a soaring market for their
shares. This applies to Lend
Lease, the Clementson com-
panies, Pioneer Concrete, the
Hooker co., Ready-mixed Con-
crete, Australian Blue Metal
and Blue Metal Industries.
After touching 90s. B.H.P.
shares have quietened to 86s.
6d. There is still much specu-
lation about a new issue. Some
think the co. may possibly
make greater resort to debt
finance than has been the case
to date.
National production figures
show superphosphate output,
which took a knock in 1958-59,
to be slightly better this year,
with particular improvement
over the last few months. Vari-
ous fertiliser companies in dif-
ferent States should benefit.
Union Carbide
■popuLARiTY of transistor
radios must be giving the
earnings of Union Carbide
Aust., Ltd., a boost. The
co. incorporates the Australian
business of Eveready, the bat-
tery people, as well as Timbrol,
Ltd. Union Carbide is also
interested in petrochemical
developments in Australia; it
is erecting a polyethylene plant
[adjacent to the petrochemical
undertaking of Vacuum Oil
Pty., Ltd., at Altona (Vic.)],
which is scheduled to start
operations in the first half of
next year.
All told, the Union Carbide
group manufactures a wide
range of products, including
agricultural, industrial and fine
chemicals (embracing hormone
weed-killers, deodorants, wood-
preservatives, paints, disinfec-
tants, plasticisers, asphalts,
flooring-tiles, and DDT), dry-
cell batteries, ore - grinders,
metal rollers, etc.
Union Carbide (U.S.A.) has
a 60 p.c. interest in the Aus-
tralian co., and this affiliation
is of great value on the techni-
cal side.
The co. is one of those in-
teresting concerns which do not
disclose their tax provision.
Shown in line at £440,866
last year, net profit was equal to
20.2 p.c. on ord. capital of
£2,150,783. The ord. div. was
kept at 10 p.c. There has been
no change in paid capital since
1958, but in 1959 a private
debenture-loan of £3f million
was arranged to finance the
Altona project.
The co.’s £1 ords. at £5 each
are an interesting proposition
for three-year holding, even
though the present yield is only
2 p.c. The co. has a greater
visible growth potential than
many other low-yielding stocks,
and by 1961-62 the new poly-
ethylene plant should be hav-
ing its effect on earnings.
A. P. Herbert on Take-
overs
Tn the course of moving a
vote of thanks to the chair-
man of the Savoy Hotel, Ltd.,
at the annual meeting in Lon-
don on April 22, Sir Alan
Herbert touched on a subject
now very much alive in Aus-
tralia :
During the year, I believe, no
attempt was made by any of the
great cuckoos of the business
world to “take-over” any of the
Savoy hotels or enterprises, nor to
eject our respected directors from
their nests. I notice a welcome
calm in the cuckoo world —and
about time, too. I was beginning
to fear that one of these property
magnates would offer to take-over
St. Paul's Cathedral, which undoubt-
edly stands on undeveloped
property, and might well make way
for a much more profitable block
of offices.
While the chorus of cuckoos was
at its height, I was considerably
shocked by a great many of the
comments in the press, the City
columns, not only what I thought
was excessive adulation of the
giant cuckoos. That, of course,
could be attributed to success of
any kind these days; I am thinking
more of their advice to share-
holders.
I know that few citizens, few of
us, perhaps, invest our money for
purely charitable reasons: but when
we have invested it, it seems to me
that we acquire not only rights
but duties.
During the cuckoo season, the
City columns, with very few excep-
tions, assumed that the shareholder
was a purely selfish person, only
governed by motives of cupidity.
"He was advised to sell or not to
sell, or wait before selling, purely
for his own advantage, that is,
without thought for the opinions
or interests of the workers in the
industry, the traditions of the par-
ticular business, or the place in
society which it held or anything
else.
Well, I think that, without being
too goody-goody, we ought to
think about those things; and the
shareholders of the Savoy can
proudly give evidence that they do.
Last year, Mr. Chairman, you
reminded us of the great assault of
cuckoos on the Savoy. I think
it was six years ago. You said, L
remember; “We were supported
in this struggle by many loyal
stockholders who did not sell their
stock despite the high price to
which it rose in the market, and
therefore it is with a quiet feeling
of satisfaction” —a characteristically
modest expression—“that I can say
that, without selling the Berkeley
Hotel or the site of it, or con-
verting it into offices (as we were
told we should have to do to justify
the market price) those stockholders
who supported us have done far
better than those who sold, and,
even ignoring two capital-bonuses,

their stock is worth more in the
market today than the highest it
ever reached during the struggle.”
So that, apart from anything else,
virtue, you see, has its own reward.
Well, that, I suggest humbly,
within reasonable limits, should be
the spirit of the shareholders. I
cannot speak for all of yours, sir;
but I can assure you, for myself
at least, that if the king, the
emperor, of all the cuckoos offered
to me all the gold in Africa, or,
far more attractive, all the women
in Hollywood, I should still tell
him to proceed to a suitable
destination.

TVIEW ZEALAND’S wool receipts
' this season could exceed
last season’s figure by £25 mil-
lion if the present average price
is maintained, says the chair-
man of the Wool Commission,
Mr. G. A. Duncan.
Addressing the Electoral
College of the New Zealand
Wool Board he estimated that
this season’s production of all
wool would be 565,000,0001 b.
—an increase of 4\ per cent,
on last season’s 540,000,0001 b.
Up to March 9 this year
986,000 bales of greasy wool —-
70 per cent, of the expected
total for the season—had been
sold at auction in N.Z. and
London privately.
The overall average price
was 45d. a lb. ex-store, which
was 25 per cent, more than
last season’s average price of
36d. a lb.
The looked-for lift in wool
prices that began at the close
of last season had been main-
tained with very little irregu-
larity during the current season.
In those circumstances the
commission had not been called
on to support prices at the sales,
except on ordinary style, and
occasionally on good Merino
and quarter-bred fleece and
oddments where its floor-prices
for these wools had been fairly
close to market prices at the
South Island sales.
Hard Liquor
An order formally fixing the
rate of duty for gin and related
liquors made in N.Z. at 90s. a
proof-gallon has been gazetted
The rate for imported gin and
similar liquors is 120 s. a
gallon.
The order includes “gin,
geneva, schnapps, vodka and
other basically-derived white-
spirit liquors as may be ap-
proved by the Minister.”
All spirits are subject to
price-control at both wholesale
and retail levels, and it is ex-
pected that the Price Tribunal
will formally fix the price of
the N.Z. product before it is
marketed.
This may be a year away.
The distillery company is await-
ing a large still for its premises,
which, like the three rectifying-
stiils to process raw liquor, is
being made in England.
The distillery company con-
sists of a large number of
wholesale houses throughout
N.Z., together with the major
British distillers—the Distillers
Co., Ltd., Seager Evans and
Co., Ltd., and Gilbeys, Ltd.
There will be three rectify-
ing-plants, representing the
overseas companies, where
Seager’s, Gordon’s, Tanqueray,
Gil bey’s and associated brands
will be produced.
. The capital of the N.Z. com-
pany is £300,000, and the
project will probably cost, with
working-capital, £500,000.
Relaxations which will allow
further imports of assembled
motor- cars, motor - cycles,
motor-scooters, and certain
classes of C.K.D. (unassembled)
commercial vehicles during the
current year have been an-
nounced by the Minister of
Customs, Mr. Boord.

Stage and Music
Opera in Melbourne
TThe opening three perform-
ances (all within the space
of a week) of the Elizabethan
Trust Opera Company’s Mel-
bourne season were not with-
out their paradoxical moments.
As the accompanying weather
chilled-off alarmingly (drop-
ping from summery warmth to
near freezing-point) the operas
got noticeably warmer; as their
appeal became more seemingly
“popular”—Richard Strauss
giving way to Verdi, who in
turn gave way to Puccini —the
audiences grew thinner; and as
the music and dramas became
generally simpler, productions
tended to become clumsy and
confused.
The opening production,
“Salome,” was without a doubt
the Company’s outstanding
artistic success so far. Based
on Oscar Wilde’s play, this not
particularly “approachable”
opera—Strauss’s almost bar-
baric score is notable for its
rich sound-textures, its often
startlingly “human” expressions
of emotion, but never for its
melodic line —was raised to a
rare plane of excellence.
From every point of view
Joan Hammond gave a mag-
nificent portrayal of Strauss’s
libidinous, necrophilic Salome,
and it was she who commanded
the performance (as, of course,
anyone playing Salome should)
from beginning to end. Un-
expectedly, not the least praise-
worthy feature of her work
here was the unselfconscious
and utterly convincing way in
which she disposed of the
Dance of the Seven Veils.
Of the other roles, the most
impressive was Robert Allman’s
Jokanaan, who had all the
starkness of a primitive carv-
ing as he hurled, by means of
a splendidly resonant baritone,
his curses at Salome.
Dr. Karl Rankl led both the
Victorian Symphony Orchestra
and the singers with superb
control, bringing out all the
power, hard brilliance and
detail of the score, at the same
time giving tension and drama-
tic shape to the libretto.
Similarly, Stefan Haag's pro-
duction, unusually imaginative
in conception, and visually a
glory, was in every way com-
plimentary to the progress of
this strangely dramatic music.
The company’s work' in
GALLERY EXIT
“Rigoletto” was not nearly so
impressive. Among the chief
defects was the inconsistency
of Eric Clapham’s conducting,
which allowed too much free-
dom to the singers (most of
whom oversang) while holding
the orchestra’s reins too tight.
The result too often was a
watered-down and lifeless ver-
sion of Verdi’s wonderful
work.
As the Duke, Donald Smith,
with a rich, finely controlled
tenor, added lustre to an other-
wise uninspiring production.
Puccini’s little-known group
of three one-act operas, “The
Trittico,” had more to com-
mend it. Despite the incredibly
melodramatic nature of the
plot and the incongruities of
the set (an ill-defined barge on
the Seine) the wonderful lyrical
flow of the music, with Dr.
Rankl once again in control,
came through clear and un-
hampered while Robert All-
man (Michele), Joyce Simmons
(Giorgetta) and Gregory Demp-
sey (Louis) sang with assur-
ance and emotional conviction
in the three main roles.
Of the remaining two operas
—each full of typical Puccini
sentiment; a sentiment which
miraculously always manages
to steer clear of sentimentality
—the most effective was “Sister
Angelica.” Valda Bagnall here
brought to the name-part a
purity of tone and feeling
which seemed much more
in keeping with the con-
vent setting than certain
aspects of the staging—for in-
stance, the uneasily mobile
Madonna, which, for some
obscure reason had to move
forward (very shakily indeed)
at the end to answer Sister
Angelica’s pleas for forgive-
ness after she had taken poison.
The company’s Sydney
season, in which the same
operas will be performed, is to
start at the Elizabethan on
May 21.

Speaight’s Shakspeare
In his farewell recital for
the Elizabethan Trust at Syd-
ney Assembly Hall, Robert
Spea i g h t’s “anthology of
Shakspearian interpretations”
showed how clear blank-verse
could be if you let it fall into
its phrasing and considered
the end-stoppings as part of
the phrasing. Here was the
answer to those who, anxious
to “modernise” Shakspeare, or
to propitiate alleged prejudice
against verse-speaking, run the
lines on and flatten clear poetry
into unintelligble prose.
Such a long description as
Enobarbus’s speech from “An-
tony and Cleopatra”—“The
barge she sat in, like a bur-
nished throne”—which for the
book-reader tends to fade,
after its superb opening, into
a sort of catalogue, can be
brought alive by such a voice
and phrasing as Speaight's into
a picture full of color; lines
over which the reader might
pass gain force and significance
from being spoken as they were
meant to be heard. It is a
delicate thing, blank - verse;
when Speaight occasionally
fluffed a word, as was natural
with so many excerpts out of
context, the whole passage
flopped; when he read one or
two pieces at a lectern, com-
prehension was almost com-
pletely lost.
One would not say that this
dinner-jacketed recital gave the
full flavor of acting; as Shy-
lock, Henry V, Enobarbus,
Macbeth, Hamlet, Othello,
Lear, Prospero, etc., Speaight’s
main effect was of clarity and
music.

The Winds of Change
It seems obvious, from the
symbolic breeze that blows up
off the river at the end of
his “Hot Summer Night” in
Wapping, that playwright Ted
Willis registered a change of
atmosphere in London before
Mr. Macmillan made his
famous African observation.
Jack Palmer is a good union-
secretary, a stout feller who has
devoted his life and undoubted
energy to furthering the cause
and interest of his workmates.
Indeed, his point of view, his
utterances and attitudes tend to
make an Australian audience
wonder if by chance they have
misread their programmes;
until Frank Stevens turns-up to
discuss a tender situation aris-
ing in the union over a
Jamaican member.
Jack argues Frank down,
heedless of the temporising
comments of his father (a good
union-man in his day) or the
interruptions of his wife Nell:

A. MACKEY Acting Registrar
Jack is a man of principle,
and nothing—no, nothing—
can be allowed to interfere
with any man’s rights, white
or black.
At this point his daughter
Kathie appears outside the
front-door with Sonny Lincoln,
a sensitive Jamaican youth
whose diffidence will not allow
him to enter the house or
declare his love for Kathie,
though the girl, equally in love,
does her best to encourage him.
Presently, confronted by
realisation that her daughter
means to marry a colored man,
Nell Palmer bursts through the
restraints of barren years dur-
ing which her husband has
devoted himself entirely to
union-affairs, leaving a frus-
trated wife to constrict her own
world to daydreams of her
daughter’s future. Whipped
by his wife’s fury, Jack has
now, for the first time in his
life, to face the clash between
principle and personal interest;
even more, personal duty, as
his wife sees it.
In this play the dramatist
never deviates from individual
conflict into the morass of
propaganda. The development
of character remains pre-
dominant; this is a crisis in
the Palmer family, the situation
is their own situation, the prob-
lem theirs. Only by unspoken
appeal to common knowledge
of current affairs is any wider
implication projected. This
serves to accentuate rather than
lessen realisation of the com-
plex difficulties involved; we
are made aware that however
nations may settle between
themselves the explosive color-
question, in the event, what-
ever the tint of our skins, the
problem remains a personal
one.
No general solution is
offered. Out of fury, heart-
break and searing words the
Palmer family reach a troubled
calm; but we have been shown
the plight of their friend Judy
Gomez, a white girl married to
another Jamaican, and we can-
not go home comforted by
dreams of a happy future for
Kathie Palmer and Sonny Lin-
coln.
Bernard Shine, producing for
the first time, made a notable
success of this play at the
Perth Playhouse. Sensitive un-
derstanding, admirable timing
and controlled tension created
a polished performance.
To distinguish amongst a
capable cast is scarcely war-
ranted. Allen Terrie gave
conviction and strength to Jack
Palmer as he progressed
through dogmatism, bluster,
and self-realisation to some
measure of human understand-
ing. As Nell Palmer, Joan
Bruce brought sympathy to a
harsh part. James Bailey’s
minor role of the old man pro-
vided him with opportunity for
a distinguished interpretation of
subtle and tender old-age. And
Michael Laurence lent simple
dignity to the diffident but
manly Sonny Lincoln.
H.D.-B.
A.B.C. Competition
In the N.S.W. finals of the
A.B.C.’s Vocal and Concerto
Competition the singing-section
was limited to two competitors,
both contraltos —a unique
occasion, as baritones and
sopranos outnumber other
voices by about 5 to 1. Both
were of rich quality, but the
winner, Yvonne Minton, nar-
rowly shaded her opponent in
her treatment of legato and
phrasing.
She sang Delilah's boastful
“O Love, From Thy Power”
with well-judged distribution of
tonal weights, bringing off some
good sonorous chest-notes and
getting high in the range with-
out strain. Diane Holmes sang
an aria from Handel’s “Julius
Caesar” with feeling for the
despair that streams through it,
but under stress found a few
notes slightly off-pitch.
The concerto winner was
pianist Rhondda Gillespie, who
gamely tackled the rarely-heard
Concerto No. 2 by American
composer Edward Macdowell,
and did it with a telling dynam-
ism. Time and again she
demonstrated her ability to
build big climaxes in the bass
so that they seemed to grow
naturally out of the foregoing
material; and, for a five-footer,
they carried a lot punch. But,
sheer force apart, she also
showed in the more subdued
stretches an impressive subtlety
of approach.
Not far behind her was
Robert Cuckson, the most
youthful competitor, who gave
a virile and intelligent account
of the taut nerves and stringy
sinews of Bartok’s Concerto
No. 3. The high commenda-
tion he received will give him
a possible chance to contest the
Commonwealth finals in July.
Two other pianists also
played admirably, though fail-
ing to gain a place. They
were Beryl Potter, who showed
style in playing the open : ng
movement of the Rachmaninoff
Third Concerto, and Albert
Landa, whose reading of two
movements of the Brahms
First captured no little of this
music’s profundity.
The Sydney Symphony
Orchestra was directed by
Joseph Post, who, with Tibor
Paul and Dr. William Lovelock,
comprised the panel of judges.
AFTERTHOUGHT
Nothing after all is really
rose-like
But a rose.
And if I should find it your
analogue,
That’s where the analogy lies.
Oh, no doubt you’re something
like,
You and the bud promise a
sensual delight
And perhaps share a skin-
texture :
But the analogy is something
other.
As some flowers set me think-
ing of a rose,
But it never reminds me of
those,
So you’re present like a whirl-
pool,
Everything drawn to a centre
that’s utterly still.
And like too in that since I
don’t live in the house;
All I can do is lean on the
fence and gaze.

Prints and Drawings
There is a great deal of non-
sense talked about the un-
importance of drawing these
days; but every genuine artist
knows that if you can’t draw
you are just not an artist; as,
if you can’t control an iambic
pentameter and a rhyme, you
aren’t a poet; and as, if you
can’t play the piano—you can’t.
So it is good to see at the
autumn exhibition of the N. S.
Wales Society of Artists at
David Jones’ (Sydney) that
drawing and design persist un-
daunted; whether completely
naturalistic as in the flowing
lines of Thea Proctor’s nudes,
more elusive and stylised as
in Jean Appleton’s landscape-
study, or more abstract as in
Roy Fluke’s spirited designs.
Because of the quality, the
variety and the lack of stridency
this is a particularly pleasant
exhibition to wander through:
noting Herbert Fugelman’s
spacious “Darling Harbor,”
Dorothy Thornhill’s “Turon
River,” Ronald Steuart’s “Seed-
pods,” Noel Counihan’s “Re-
clining Nude,” Strom Gould’s
delicate “People,” a couple of
nudes by Santry, some curious
black - and - whites by Maxi-
milian Feuerring, Arthur
Murch’s white rabbit, Guy
Warren’s mad-hatter appropri-
ately nearby, and a couple of
early sketches by Dobell,
especially “Reading Rabelais.”
But what particularly in-
terested this commentator, since
it is always stimulating to find
an established artist with some-
thing new to say, were the
tinted drawings of Arthur Evan
Read and George Lawrence.
Both,'in oils, tend to be turgid;
both in their less ambitious
little sketches here are fresh and
attractive.

to do your own packing in all-steel, weather-proof, pilfer-proof containers that
are easily lifted on and off trains.
Then there’s bulk loading now available to 69 centres in N.S.W, and
giving next-day delivery to places as far distant aS Armidale, Dubbo, Parkes
and Wagga Wagga.
We certainly don’t stand pat on our record of 105 years in the transport
business, but seek to meet the changing conditions of the changing times.
Whatever the freight, whether it comes from factories, mines or pastures, we
can help consignors in a great many ways. Let us show how we can help you.

surely be between what might
be called the “medico-realists,”
who would insist on calling a
spade a spade in portraying
the not-so-pretty aspects of
humanity, and the “surgical-
idealists,” who would seek out
beauty at any cost, straighten-
ing an irregular feature here,
elongating a neck there, and
generally improving the regret-
table imperfections of Nature.
How disillusioning, then, to
find that the British Medical
Association Art Group’s first
exhibition in Melbourne con-
tains nothing bu f country
scenes, flower-studies and sea-
scapes—not a nude or a full-
length portrait in sight!
Anything a disillusioned re-
viewer says must be suspect,
Here, however, are his obser-
vations (diagnosis?) for what
they’re worth: The B.M.A.
painters are an extroverted
bunch (the findings of psychia-
try don’t seem to have had
much effect on their art: Dali,
likewise, has had no obvious
influence); they have no truck
with modernity as such; they
stick close to the traditional
points of view. Technical
facility is something few of
them possess; what might be
termed a healthy amateurism
triumphs.
Films
A Sydney Handful
“Quiet Flows the Don”
(Gala) is the third part of the
Russian trilogy based on Sholo-
kov’s monumental novel. The
time now is 1919-20, when the
Don Cossacks were battling
the Reds to retain their auto-
nomy. Like its predecessors,
the film projects events cogently,
draws character-portraits of
distinction, and is directed
throughout with imagination
and insight. It is concerned
less with politics than with
people and their interwoven
lives, and a few bodies hit the
dust beside the great river
before the unhappy hero
Grigori seeks philosophically
to remake his life from the
ruins of his domestic hopes.
The acting, as in the earlier
films, is excellent.
“On the Beach” (Regent)l
Even such a skilled hand as
Stanley Kramer's cannot gener-
ate the suspense needed to
electrify this version of Nevil
Shute's novel about the destruc-
tion of mankind by radioactive-
fallout following a global
nuclear war. The feeling of
horror at the last stand of the
human race in Melbourne just
doesn’t burgeon. Gregory Peck,
as the U.S. submarine-com-
mander who elects to take his
ship and his doomed crew back
to ’Frisco to die, does his best
with the material allotted him;
Fred, Astaire, Ava Gardiner
and Anthony Perkins are also
involved.
“Edge of Eternity” (Lyceum):
Though marred at times by
melodrama, there is some sus-
pense and rewarding excite-
ment in this story of mysteri-
ous murders on the edge of
Colorado’s Grand Canyon
culminating in a life-and-death
struggle on the roof of a cable-
car strung across the gap.
Cornel Wilde and Victoria
Shaw fill the chief roles.

The WILDCAT
COUMN
Industrial Acceptance Holdings, Ltd.
r T'HE volume of business increased last
term, topping £BO million (up about
£lO million), but rising motor-vehicle
insurance claims and expenses, higher
salaries, stamp-duties, etc., had an
adverse effect on the group’s net earn-
ings. Hiring charges were not increased
to match the mounting operating costs,
but I.A.H.’s chairman says that it may
be “difficult to continue this policy in
the future.”
Often described as the largest Aus-
tralian h.-p. finance-house, Industrial
Acceptance Holdings, Ltd., operates
throughout the Commonwealth. The
group finances hire-purchase transactions
with motor - vehicles, farm - equipment,
machinery, furniture, domestic-
appliances, etc. The I.A.H. organisation
has two operating insurance subsidiaries
within its framework (Ajax Insurance
Co. and Surrey Insurance Co.) to serve
both the group’s h.-p. customers and out-
side clients, writing fire-, accident- and
general - policies. In addition, I.A.H.
holds the share-capital of the Union
Building Society, one of the three largest
building-societies in Victoria.
The A.N.Z. Bank is the co.’s trading-
bank assoc Tate and holds a 14 p.c. share-
interest in I.A.H.—a relatively modest
stake compared with other similar
finance-cos. and trading-banks ties.
Last year, outstandings increased by
£15,737,834 to a massive £75,336,224.
Group gross profit from trading (includ-
ing earned insurance premiums) was
£622,903 higher at £11,289,064. Earn-
ings from general investments brought-in
another £67,386 and sundry income
grossed £86.853, totalling £11,443,303 (up
£701,990).
During the year under review there
was a steady increase in the premium-
income of Ajax Insurance Co., Surrey
Insurance Co. and Union Building
Society, but underwriting results were
adversely affected by heavy claims
in motor-vehicles department. The co.
says “it is apparent that premiums for
this class of business are inadequate,”
due to the increasing density of road-
traffic and rising costs of repairs.
“Efforts are being made to bring the
premiums to a realistic basis.”
Operating expenses were £702,565
higher at £6,039,971, including insurance
claims paid and outstanding. Total costs
increased by £1,071,011 to £9,616,895,
swallowing-up most of the fatter gross
earnings. Included were provisions for
depreciation (£53,451, up £9001) and
taxation (£1,127,223, down £231,214).
Consolidated net profit for the year
ended December 31, 1959, slipped-down
by £387,399 to £1,808,030:

* Subject to intangibles, written out of the accounts
in 1957. f 10 p.c. prior to formation of holding co.
and 8J p.c. afterwards.
After satisfying the unchanged pref.-
div. requirements, this was equivalent to
an earning - rate of 21.3 p.c. on the
average ordinary capital, compared with
28.9 p.c. in the preceding term, and 34.8
p.c. in 1957, 29.3 p.c. in 1956, 33.4 p.c.
in 1955 and 26.7 p.c. in 1954.
The consolidated net profit was
claimed after calculating unearned h.-p.
income at £9,748,393 (up £2,391,011) or
12.9 p.c. of total outstandings (12.3 p.c.
in 1958).
The steady 16f p.c. dividend on the
slightly higher ord. capital absorbed
£1,366,666. Reserves received £381,364,
and also benefited by £200,000 share-
premiums, £31,200 capital-profit on take-
over of the Union Building Society, and
£6513 tax overprovided in the previous
term. There was a net loss of £2515
on disposal of capital assets, leaving dis-
closed reserves and undistributed earn-
ings at £6,918,155, free of intangibles.
This supported a paid capital of
£9,200,000, in £1,000,000 6 p.c. cum

During the year the co. issued 400,000
ss. ords. at a premium of 10s. each in
acquisition of the Union Building
Society in Victoria, bringing subscribed
capital to its present level.
Last term was marked by another
big increase in notes and debentures,
which leapt by £13,452,796. Total h.-p.
outstandings, debtors and stock jumped
by £15,737,834 to £75,336,224. The ratio
of borrowings (excluding creditors, up
£576,753 at £3,201,933) to outstandings
was 62.2 p.c. at balance-date. The true
ratio was somewhat higher, because of
the inclusion of stock and debtors in the
overall figure for outstandings shown in
the balance-sheet.
Outstandings represented 92.98 p.c. of
I. total consolidated assets (93.4
p.c. in 1958 and 94.1 p.c. in 1957). The
proportion shows a slow, continuing
downward trend. The ratio of share-
holders’ funds to borrowings was 2.9 to 1.
Cash, Commonwealth bonds, deposits,
prepayments, etc., amounted to
£3,613,403 (up £855,326). Freeholds in-
creased by £359,259 to £1,279,537.
Net tangible assets-backing worked
out at £l6 2s. 4d. for the prefs. and
9s. 3d., for the ss. ords.
I.A.H. remains in a strong position
as far as financial structure and
earning-power are concerned. The two
successive falls in profits and earning-
rates are indicative rather of the general
trend in the h.-p. industry in Australia.
Profits are levelling - out because
earlier successes attracted a lot of
new capital into the game. Competition
has become very keen, operating costs
have mounted and margins have edged-
down.
Rising motor-vehicles registrations-are
an encouraging factor. Although the
co.’s subsidiary motor-vehicles insurance
business is encountering some difficulties,
the basic financing of car-purchases con-
tinues to be profitable. Diversification
moves are under way.
The volume of business handled in


the first three months of the current
term to March 31, 1960, is greater than
in the corresponding previous period.
Outstandings now exceed £BO million.
At the last sale in Sydney the ss. ords.
changed hands at 15s. 3d. a unit, for an
immediate yield of 5.5 p.c. on the basis
of the steady 16f p.c. div.-rate.
Mary Kathleen Uranium, Ltd.
Under an agreement effected in March,
1955, between Rio Tinto Mining Co.
of Australia Pty. [now Rio Tinto Hold-
ings (Australia) Pty.], Australasian Oil
Exploration, Ltd., and the Walton-Mac-
Conachy Syndicate (original discoverer
of the Mary Kathleen uranium field),
Mary Kathleen Uranium, Ltd., acquired
the Mary Kathleen uranium leases
situated between Cloncurry and Mt. Isa
(Q.). A.O.E. subsequently sold its interest
to Mary Kathleen Investments, Ltd. [now
Kathleen Investments (Aust.), Ltd.].
Division of interest in M.K.U. is as fol-
lows :
Rio Tinto Holdings (Aust.) 51 p.c.,
Kathleen Investments (Aust.) 35 p.c.,
Walton-MacConachy Syndicate 7 p.c.,
and nominees of Rio Tinto Holdings
(Aust.) Pty. 7 p.c., part of which interest
has now been disposed of on ’Change.
M.K.U. has contracted with the U.K.
Atomic Energy Authority to supply 4500
short tons of uranium - oxide, the con-
tract providing, inter alia, a small
premium for early delivery the
premium was at a maximum during
1959. Successive reductions will elimi-
nate the premium by the end of 1962,
the first reduction applying as from last
January. The contract price works out
at somewhere between £A.4O and £A.45
million gross, depending on dates of
delivery. This would indicate a price of
£A. 10,000 per ton of uranium-oxide ; the
exact figure is still an official secret.
Supervised by Rio Tinto, construction-
work began early in 1956. Total cost
of development was then reckoned in
the vicinity of £lO million. It has actually
run to around £l3 million. Large sums
were advanced by Rio Tinto (5 p.c.
unsecured) and the U.K. Authority
(secured). Rio Tinto arranged an over-
draft.
Under the terms of the mortgage,
M.K.U. may not pay a div. other than
the first 5 p.c. of any pref. div., unless
a sum equal to the gross amount of the
div. is at the same time applied to the
reduction of either the co.’s bank debt
or overdraft or its indebtedness to the
U.K. Authority and to Rio Tinto in
respect of moneys advanced in the ratio
of four parts to the Authority and one
part to Rio Tinto.
Production of uranium-oxide com-
menced in June, 1958, well ahead of
schedule. Five months later M.K.U.
delivered its first shipment of oxide.
Profits have been spectacular.
In its first full operating year, to
December 31 last, M.K.U. milled 479,990
short tons of ore (226,000 short tons in
the previous seven months) with head-
values of 3.361 b. per ton (3.071 b.). Over-
all recovery, 90.48 p.c. (86.3 p.c.), pro-
duced 1,452,1361 b. (562,0001 b.) of
uranium-oxide.
Gross revenue was £6,475,267
(£2,566,818); mining, milling and admin-
istration costs, etc., were £2,386,248
(£1,035,472); interest on loans and over-
draft was £365,133 (£114,080). Operating
profit worked - out at £3,723,886
(£1,417,266). The co. made no provision
either for depreciation or taxation —
profits from uranium-mining are exempt
from tax liability up until June 30,
1965:

Two ord. divs. were paid during the
year —Is. 3d. on May 22 and Is. 6d. on
November 17, absorbing in all £781,506
and representing in aggregate 110 p.c.
return on face-value of scrip.
M.K.U.’s issued capital is held in
5,683,678 2s. 6d. stock - units and
1,580,400 20s. 8 p.c. cumulative redeem-
able pref. shares. Pref. divs. totalled
£80,401.
The prefs. are held in entirety by Rio
Tinto and were issued last term in part-
satisfaction of the long-term loan.
Profits not specifically earmarked,
and taking prefs. into considera-
tion, are equivalent to 266 p.c. of ord.
capital. This suggests the possibility of
a much higher div. than that distributed
last term. Indication that the div.-rate
will in fact be raised follows the latest
handout of Is. per stock-unit made last
February. Divs. will in future be con-
sidered at three-monthly intervals.
Reserves rose in all £2,861,979 to
£4,279,245, and include £2,336,000
(£708,000) set aside for repayment of
long-term loans and £128,000 (nil) set
aside as prescribed by statute, being a
sum equal to the amount applied in re-
deeming prefs.
Streamlining of the milling process has
already brought considerable savings in
costs. The co. proposes further develop-
mental works. Construction of a new
dam, the co.’s second such project,
should begin shortly. Water-supplies,
indispensable in the extraction of
uranium-oxide, are at present dependent
to too great an extent on the vicissitudes
of an unreliable rainfall.
The massive nature of the undertaking
is already visible in these figures:

High profit-earning has already altered
the debt-structure spectacularly.
What of M.K.U.’s future? World
shortages of uranium have given way
to world surpluses.
The co.’s contract with the U.K.
Atomic Energy Authority cuts-out in
1964, if present delivery rates are main-
tained, and there is every possibility that
they will be maintained, if not increased.
Certainly a continuity of supply is
assured. Proven ore reserves must now
be in excess of the equivalent of 10,000
tons of oxide, and the co. is confident
of further significant additions as indi-
cated by diamond-drilling to the north
of the present ore-body. But will demand
be sustained? Will M.K.U. be able to
sell its product on the open market? At
the moment legislation prohibits export
of uranium-oxide from Australia above
25001 b. to any one purchaser-country.
“If, however, we are to become signifi-
cant suppliers on the open market, it
will be necessary to liberalise the existing
export policy.”
From a competitive point of view,
M.K.U. is fortunate to be one of the
cheapest producers of uranium-oxide in
the world. The co. is competent to
compete for and secure overseas con-
tracts, provided artificial restrictions
presently in force are removed. Japan,
with a large-scale nuclear-power pro-
gramme in progress, has already evinced
considerable interest in the co.’s product.
Three sample lots of uranium concen-
trates were shipped to Japan last year.
The Australian Atomic Energy Com-
mission has an option on a significant
tonnage of the co.’s future production,
but it is not yet known whether the
option will be exercised. The advent of
nuclear power in Australia would seem
to assure a domestic market for Mary
Kathleen.
In the meantime, earnings continue
their sharp upward acceleration. Net
operating profit to March 31 last was
£1,064,554, compared with £764,259 for
the corresponding quarter of 1959. In-
vestors, discounting the problematical
future of the co., but confident of con-
tinued divs. at least until 1964, are pay-
ing a high premium for the 2s. 6d. stock
units. They fetched 395. 9d. on Sydney
’Change last week.
Yates Seeds, Ltd.
TZj 1 arnings have fluctuated considerably
since the Sydney-registered Yates
Seeds, Ltd., joined the public list in
April,. 1951, but its dividend record has
been steady.
The co. is well known as a grower
and merchant of vegetable- and flower-
seeds. The 77-year-old business has also
built-up an impressive trade in various
agricultural seeds, nursery-supplies and
assorted gardening-items.
Consumer-demand in the first half of
last term was said to be rather slow and
prices tended lower, but business picked-
up in the final six months. Turnover and
cost figures were not disclosed, but ex-
penses were “carefully controlled” and
“slightly lower.”
Consolidated net profit for the year
ended February 29, 1960 (the sub-
sidiaries balance in October and Novem-
ber), edged-up by £1496 to £39,166, after
setting-aside £16,038 for depreciation

On the assets side the most
notable changes were in stocks
(down £21,688) and book-debts
(up £23,155 at £140,341), in-
dicating a better turnover.
Net tangible assets gave a
backing of 345. 7d. for each
f.-p. 20s. unit of the unchanged
one-class capital (£258,015 in
ords.).
During the year a third sub-
sidiary joined the Yates family.
Guy Yates Pty. was absorbed
on undisclosed terms.
Better trading conditions pre-
vailing in the second half of
last year have continued early
in this term, improving the
general business outlook. The
board expects a “satisfactory
level” of profits.
At the last sale in Sydney
the scrip was traded at 38s. 9d.
a 20s. unit. The immediate
return is 5.2 p.c. on the basis
of the steady 10 p.c. div.-rate.
Hopkins Odium, Ltd.
First listed in Melbourne in
August, 1952, Hopkins
Odium, Ltd., acquired the
£76,875 share-capital of Apex
Belting Pty., manufacturer of
machine-belting, etc., in return
for 400,000 10s. ords. Of
these, 100,000 were later put-
up for public subscription at
par.
Since then, a one-for-four
par-issue in 1957 and small
issues to the staff-fund have
raised the one-class capital to
£260,000.
Apex Belting Pty. continues
as the operating subsidiary,
producing leather-, rubber-
and rubber-canvas transmis-
sion- and conveyor-belting
under the popular “Apex” and
“Brammer” brand-names.
Thus far, Hopkins Odium
has given a creditable perform-
ance. Earnings have fluctuated,
but a steady 10 p.c, s div.-rate
has been maintained since
1954.
Sales reached “a record-
high level” last term. Turn-
over was said to be 1\ p.c.
above the previous year’s total.
However, consolidated net
profit for the year ended

The result was arrived at
after providing £25,598 (up
£3679) for depreciation, pay-
ing higher interest on capital-
borrowings and setting-aside
£25,876 for taxation (down
£1187).
The fall in profit was
ascribed to increases in
depreciation write-offs and
higher interest-charges, aggre-
gating £8350.
The earning-rate on the
unchanged average ord. capital
slid-down to 16.7 p.c. This
compares with 17.6 p.c. in the
preceding year, and 23.6 p.c.,

Interstate Oil Limited
Interstate Oil, Ltd., in-
corporated in Victoria
in April, 1955, has an area
in the vicinity of Innamincka,
in the north-east of S. Aus-
tralia.
Interstate Oil holds approxi-
mately a third share-interest
in Frome-Broken Hill Co.
Pty., Ltd. In addition, a 5 p.c.
share - interest (25,000 $1
Canadian f.-p. ords.) is held in
Humber Barrier Reef Oils
Pty. which has a permit to
prospect a section of the Great
Barrier Reef (Q.).
An issue of 2,000,000 ss.
ords., one-for-one at par
(underwritten by Consolidated
Zinc Pty.) lifted paid capital
to £1,000,000 in ss. ords. in
July, 1959. Recently, nominal
capital was increased to
£2,000,000, but the board says
no new share-issue is intended
in the immediate future.
Interstate Oil showed a net
loss of £2448 in the year
ended December 31, 1959,
compared with a net profit of
£4289 earned in the preceding
term. Lower income from
interest on securities (down
£3490 at £5872) and higher
administrative expenses, etc.
(up £3247 at £8320), were the
joint causes. Real interest in
the co., however, lies in its
oil-searching associates.
The liquid position improved
following the share-issue.
Liquid assets were £149,895
higher at £317,916 (including
£300,000 in short-term securi-
ties). Against this, external
liabilities amounted to £2956
(up £1781):

The “most significant result”
of Frome-Broken Hill Co.
Pty. (a one-third interest) was
achieved in the Portland-Cape
Otway area (Vic.) where a
seismic survey, commenced in
1958, was followed by selec-
tion of a site for an explora-
tion-well near Port Campbell
(Vic.). Drilling began on
September 9, 1959.
Several cores of a thick
section of marine-mudstones
penetrated in late November,
1959, at the bottom 1300 ft. of
a total depth of 5718 ft., showed
the presence of small quanti-
ties of gas. A subsequent open-
hole drill-test produced “a
strong flow of gas which
analysis later showed to con-
sist mainly of hydrocarbons
with a high percentage of com-
ponents in the ethane-pentane
range.”
In January, 1960, several
sandstones between 4463 ft. and
5928 ft. were tested, “all except
one producing water contain-
ing gas in solution.” During
these tests petroliferous gas
was produced at rates up to
4-million cu.-ft. a day. There
was a significant amount of
condensate. After several days,
pressure dropped and salt-
water came in, showing the
well to be non-commercial.
Further seismic surveys are
in progress to determine the
location of a second explora-
tion-well.
Humber Barrier Reef Oils
Pty.’s stratigraphic test-drill on
Wreck Island (Q.) failed to
show oil or gas. A gravity-
survey is to be made of the
Swain Reefs (Q.)
At the last sale in Sydney
Interstate Oil’s scrip fetched
18s. 3d. for each ss. ord. unit.
Funds needed for further
exploration were described as
“adequate” for the immediate
future.

From Herbert Holman
'TTravel for pleasure is such
an important element in
the economies of Western
European countries that the
O.E.E.C. has seen fit to publish
a report on tourism.
How many temporary
“foreigners” are there in Europe
during a year? The O.E.E.C.
puts the figure at the staggering
total of 40-million “arrivals,”
in 19 countries, bringing gross
receipts of $3OOO million and
net receipts of $lOOO million.
Traditionally, countries have
encouraged tourists as an aid
towards balancing external pay-
ments, but tourism is now con-
sidered to stimulate a variety
of activities and to percolate
into hitherto unexpected
avenues of trade.
The United Kingdom which,
with Germany, shows a nega-
tive balance on comings and
goings, spends as much as
£820,000 a year on publicity
alone, while France and Swit-
zerland spent £BOO,OOO and
£675,000 respectively.
Some 2\- million Britons
spend their holidays abroad,
mainly in Spain, Italy, France
or Switzerland, but Italy is the
most popular for Europeans as
a whole, having attracted eight-
million in 1958 (and as many
day-trippers) and gained a net
balance of $4lO million —enab-
ling a payments surplus in
current account to be achieved
for the first time since the war.
Second is Germany, with
4,750,000 arrivals, Spain and
Austria following with
3,500,000 each. Prosperity in
Germany accounts for one-half
of Italy’s visitors, more than
one-half of Austria’s and one-
third of Switzerland’s. Britain,
formerly Europe's dominant
traveller-nation, is now in
third or fourth place; in fact,
more Americans visited France
or Greece than did Britons.
One of the problems, of
course, is the drain on foreign
exchange, which cost Germany
the equivalent of $490 million
and Britain $430 million; but it
cost the U.S.A. $1460 million.
The American Government
have countered with a recipro-
cal campaign (1960 is to be
“Visit U.S.A. Year”) and ex-
pect some 600,000 visitors.
Despite the potential growth
of. the tourist industry, there is
anxiety among Britain’s 1400
or so travel-agents. Accord-
ing to “Financial Times,” this
year’s lavish campaign has
proved disappointing.
Holiday travel remains a
luxury, and has to give place
to other commitments, such as
the cost of paying for and
maintaining the inevitable small
car and the increasing weight
of hire-purchase involvement.
But some enterprising agencies
are doing good business by
arranging for rented villas in
Italy and Spain. It is also
understood that Channel
Islands and U.K. resorts are
expecting a bumper season.
Market Pointers
In one very dull and enervat-
ing financial period (a mood
for which the Chancellor of the
Exchequer was largely respon-
sible) there were two interesting
announcements.
“The Times” launched yet
another share-index —or, more
strictly, a series of linked in-
dexes —with a hint to the effect
that the only other daily index
of industrial shares, the 25-
year-old “F.T. Ordinary,” is
not quite as up-to-the-minute
as it might be. [“lt is certain
that if (it) were being con-
structed again today with the
same purpose as before, it
would cover a different selec-
tion of securities.”]
There are, in fact, eight in-
dexes, of which the “A” in-
cludes 150 securities; these are
subdivided into “B” (50 very
large companies) and “C” (the
rest); 43 producers of capital-
goods are isolated from “A” to
form index “D,” and another
43, this time producers of con-
sumer-goods, to form “E”;
commodity, goldmining and in-
dustrial preference shares are
the remaining three.
Professor M. G. Kendall,
who is the brain behind the
project, states that indexes have
three main functions: as
economic indicators, as a stan-
dard for portfolios and as
guides for timing of investment
decisions. The new ones will
be weighted arithmetic aver-
ages (not geometric, as with
“Financial Times”) and will be
prepared daily by electronic
computers.
The second project is cer-
tainly bold. It is the attempt
by two actuaries to estimate
the “present value” of leading
equities. These two investment-
managers have spent some
years studying the profit-earn-
ing prospects of individual
companies and have, inter alia,
reached many conclusions on
share-selection which are of
value to all investors, not least
to those who look first for pos-
sibilities of capital appreciation,
It is interesting to note that,
out of the 17 shares selected,
in 10 instances the market price
exceeded the “estimated aver-
age future value (next 5 years)”,
This figure suggests that the
market has over-discounted the
growth of 1.C.1. by 20 per cent,
and of Marks and Spencer and
Unilever by 15 per cent,
These gentlemen make no
claim that their method is proof
against all vicissitudes, but
affirm that it has been of use
to them in two ways—by en-
couraging more thorough ana-
lysis of company figures and
by the independence it gives
them in making investment
decisions when other factors
(undue pessimism or optimism,
for example) influence market
trends.


In Peace-and War
Time to Think
By JOHN FOUNTAIN
Unemployment and war,
both admittedly undesir-
able states, have this
incidental advantage for
many people caught up in them
—there are, off and on, splen-
did opportunities to sit down
and think.
Filling-in a period between
jobs, sitting here about 50 miles
from Sydney looking out a
window at a gap in the rain-
misted mountains (and back
at the typewriter; and back
at the mountains again), I
realise 1 haven't thoroughly
indulged in the exercise for
years ; not since I was in the
Army.
The world, in the guise of
buses, trains, pay-envelopes
and deductions from same, has
been too much with us these
last few years ; getting and
spending—with a chronic and
galloping gap between the
two —have filled our minds
with a froth of trivia, leaving
the things worth thinking
about mostly submerged.
Those things are there, right
enough, and now and then we
see them, but in the meantime
there’s the bus to catch, those
monthly instalments to meet,
these proofs to be read . . .
That's the way it’s been with
me —and that, I suspect, is how
it is with a good many more.
There's always the danger that
the wash of triviality will erode
the solid stuff clean out to sea,
eventually.
I'm not advocating early
retirement, even for myself. It
is, I concede, necessary to com-
pete when you can’t afford to
do anything else, and if your
livelihood depends on working
in a city, Sydney is, I suppose,
as good a one as any to com-
pete in. But sitting here in
the surprising peace of a strip
of bush within easy motoring-
distance of Sydney tends to
throw certain things into sharp
relief, and, inevitably, the mind
swings around to that other
time when there was leisure to
look, so to speak, back and
forward and across; in
patches ; sandwiched between
slices of quite violent activity ;
during the war.
'T'he war I’m thinking of
began in 1939 with the in-
vasion of Poland by Germany,
and ended, if I remember cor-
rectly, with the dropping of an
atom-bomb on Hiroshima and
the presentation of Poland to
Russia. After Korea, Malaya,
Suez, and one thing and
another,’ it seems a long time
ago—until you sit down and
think about it.
Enlistment was voluntary, as
it had been in World War I,
and the men who joined the
Second A.I.F. early in the piece
were, I suppose, a pretty fair
cross-section of Australia,
taking into consideration the
Army’s preferences in age and
physique ; all trades and pro-
fessions represented, and just
about every shade of political
opinion.
They were, by and large, a
good type—although that idea
took time to sink in. Most of
us, when we first joined-up,
had no standard of compari-
son. At first all was confusion,
a ferment of activity. This was
not one of the periods when
we had time to think.
But thoughts did sort of
sneak up, among the hustle and
saluting and the rather feverish
gaiety, the scramble of final
leave and the cheerful, silly
songs. Remember them?
“Run, Rabbit,” “Roll Out the
Barrel,” “Kiss Me Goodnight,
Sergeant-Major,” and the rest.
Sobering thoughts prompted by
the Army’s questions about
next-of-kin, the implications of
“meat-tickets,” curiosity con-
cerning the mechanics of war-
fare. Pointing a and
banging a kerosene-tin in imi-
tation of a machine'-gun was
all very well, but would that
sort of thing really impress the
Germans?
Wait till you get to Pales-
tine, our instructors said
soothingly, the fair dinkum
training starts there. Well, that
was all right. We went back to
banging kerosene-tins . . .
AR clearing the Heads, after
embarking in darkness.
Something final about Sydney

Kenzie said, half-grinning.

No comment. Waves and
waves of no comment We
were all a bit thoughtful that
morning . . .
. .
e were thoughtful again—
a different “we”—rattling
over a high road, snow glitter-
ing around and far below us,
our canvas - covered two -
pounder wagging behind us
like the tail of a hysterical
retriever.
This picture evoked by a
note from John McTigue, in
which, apropos of nothing at
all, he refers to “That freezing
bath in the waters from Mount
Olympus. Remember it? It
was while we were en route to
the Monastir Gap.”
Remember it! It was one of
the peaks of living. Intoxicat-
ing, like that dance in the snow,
waiting for whatever fantastic
amount of tanks was due
through the pass in 35 minutes
precisely.
John was our sergeant. Now-
adays he sells insurance, lives
in a flat at Edgecliff, Sydney,-
and plays bowls at Double
u . T , T .
ran, yah, lm an Indian,”
sang our mad sergeant, running
and leaping. “Yah, yah,
Indian,’ chanted the gun-crew,
round and round the dug-in
two-pounder, leaping like de-
mented ballet-dancers, a
lunatic ririg. Warmed by the
special issue of extra-special
rum and by something else—
leadership, perhaps.
Because, looking back, it
wasn’t insane at all. Com-
pared with the encouragement
offered his troops by an
infantry c.o. in the same
campaign it was highest
military wisdom. A Chur-
chillian speech, about how
happy they’d all be to die
where they stood . . . and the
loot-colonel, stout fellow,
doubtless meant every word of
it. But the timing was wrong.
Night; bitter cold ; the cold
creeping up from legs to
stomach ; everyone tired ;
everyone, before the exhorta-
tions were over, thoroughly
depressed. If you’re not a
Churchill or a Henry the Fifth,
perhaps it's wiser to give eve-
of-battle oratory a miss.
The dance in the snow, like
that splendid splashing in the
iron-cold water of Olympus,
did us the world of good. Stuck
out there, one gun-crew, we
needed cheering-up. A look-
out kept an eye peeled for the
tanks, which didn’t come that
day, anyway, any more than
the seven companies of
German infantry we were later
advised to expect. That’s right,
seven companies—that's what
the lieutenant said, as he wished
us luck and waved us good-
bye. Into his ute and off to
visit another gun-crew, out of
sight behind some frozen
lump of mountain . . .
W Ap FEN SS, miles back where
vv they had no right to be,
finally put us in the bag,
the whole battery, caught
in an ambush at night. Not a
cheerful episode. Adding-up,
like so much in that part of the
war, like the campaign itself, to
waste.
Waste of time, waste of
opportunity, waste of lives,
waste of some first-class fight-
ing-material, officers and men.
Isolated acts of resolution,
like John McTigue’s capture of
a machine-gun position, Goldy
Kinnear’s capture of the
German officer in charge of the
Waffen SS party—wasted be-
cause they didn’t make any
difference.
One aspect of the whole busi-
ness summarised in a little
scene by the roadside next
morning. A bedraggled group
of us lined-up, guards on the
wings, a knot of German
officers opposite. A German
major asked for the senior
officer to step forward. He was
Doug Crawford, our battery
commander, a Queenslander,
as were the majority of men in
our unit, the Ist Anti-Tank
Regiment. Asked his name and
rank, Crawford gave them.


Unit? Crawford braced him-
self (with some reason ; a few
hours before a number of our
wounded had been systemati-
cally shot) and said firmly he
wasn’t prepared to answer that
question.
“Then I’ll tell you,” the
major said, and did. Unit,
brigade, and a lot more.
Another scene that morning,
at a field dressing-station,
where a cheerful, blond young
surgeon, red to the elbows, did
what he could for both lots of
wounded, briskly and impar-
tially, and asked, candid blue
eyes wide: “But tell me, why
did you wish to fight against
Germany?”
Why? So far as the country
was concerned, our elected
leaders had made the decision.
What it amounted to, I sup-
pose, was following England's
lead —after, no doubt, due con-
sideration and the weighing of
a mass of competent opinion ;
at least, one hopes so. But
that’s what it boiled down to
—Mr. Menzies would hardly
have declared war on Germany
if Mr. Chamberlain hadn’t
done so first. Because of
certain words uttered by Mr.
Chamberlain in London, by
Mr. Menzies in Canberra, we
were there in Greece. Although,
of course, we weren’t com-
pelled to be there. We were
free agents, volunteers. The
German surgeon knew it.
That, in part, was what he
was driving at. It was some-
thing that intrigued, and some-
times annoyed, a good many
Germans.
But, in the first place: Why?
Because of Poland? After
what has happened to Poland,
that reason has a wry sound.
But Roosevelt and Churchill
hadn’t yet handed Poland over
to Stalin, so it seemed fairly
valid then. Russia and Ger-
many were still uneasy allies,
America was neutral, Aus-
tralian troops weren’t needed
at home because, presumably,
there was no serious threat
from Japan.
So here we were in Greece,
on a campaign that was the
fruit of Winston Churchill’s
fertile brain, with, no doubt,
the approval of the Australian
Government; and because the
Australian Sixth Division,
some crack New Zealand units,
British armor (Tank Corps and
Hussars) and infantry and a
great number of base troops,
technicians and the like, and
much valuable material were
here, Wavell’s entire strategy
in North Africa went to pot.
It had been brilliant so far, a
miracle of improvisation for
which Wavell got small thanks,
but it couldn’t sustain the
diversions to Greece.
Poland? Sanctity of pledges?
Maybe. True, the lightest read-
ing of history indicated that
nations seldom, if ever, permit
the most solemn undertakings
to seriously conflict with self-
interest, but maybe there was
something in it —the world
might be turning into a better
place. We were young enough
to give the world the benefit
of the doubt.
Economic rivalries, balance
of power? Maybe again. Not
that a recognition of the fact
of a stony-hearted Realpolitik
at work makes any difference
to individual responsibility.
Assuming, for the sake of
argument, that the modern
State is a sort of pirate ship,
if you live off the booty—i.e.,
accept the benefits of the State
—you can’t decently be squeam-
ish about repelling boarders,
or even joining a boarding-
party.
Although, to be sure, it does
seem hard when those who
don’t risk their skins in these
little skirmishes get a lion’s
share of the swag. And it
seems elementary common-
sense, in that kind of craft,
that the crew should have con-
fidence in the skipper and
know his destination . . .
/jetting back to personal
” reasons: Why?
There was McKenzie’s ex-
planation, clearing the Heads.
There was that of a good
friend of mine, who had lived
illegally before the war and
hoped to do likewise, on a
larger scale, after, but had
declared a sort of amnesty for
property-owners for the dura-
tion: Travel broadened the
mind.
The one from another friend,
a socially prominent grazier.
Drinking in the Australia, in
Sydney, he saw his brother
enter, booted, plumed and
spurred, an officer in the Light
Horse, and asked him if there
was a circus in town. Brother
said, No, there was a war on
—pity he couldn’t find some-
thing better to do than hang
round pubs and racecourses.
Friend said rudely—and some-
what unfairly—that if he was
thinking of donning uniform
he’d join the A.1.F., not the
Boy Scouts (the Light Horse
was militia). Brother said he’d
be surprised if the A.I.F.
accepted him, but, if he did
get in, he’d probably spend
most of his time in boob.
Friend said that’s what you
think, caught a taxi, and en-
listed. He finished the war as
a private, without a red line
in his pay-book, as he said
proudly. He died soon after he
came home, his physique weak-
ened by heavy work in a Polish
coalmine on top of the rigors
of Crete. He was a very good
soldier,, and a gentleman in
situations where being gentle—
that is to say, civilised—was
extremely difficult.
There were all sorts of
pressures and reasons, includ-
ing unemployment—lo per
cent, of Australia’s labor-force
was unemployed in 1939.
At the field dressing-station
I saw a boy I knew, an infantry-
man, and he was dying. Why
this made such an impression
on me I would have found it
hard to say—people had been
dying around me all night—but
it did. For one thing, he was
very young. I had been a big
boy, he had been a little boy,
at school, and that was where
I had last seen him. By rights
he should have still been there,
I felt obscurely, sitting for his
Leaving, perhaps, at the end
of the year.
I had always thought of him ?
as a rather funny little boy,
and this seemed to make it
worse. I felt he had been
cheated —not simply of life,
and the promise of his years ;
that was self-evident —but of
some sort of recognition that
was his due. Our esteem had
gone to a different type of
boy, the dominant personalities,
the athletic heroes. And while
a good many of these were
carrying all before them back
home, this boy was dying be-
side the muddy road to Fiorina,
quietly and very bravely.
Nothing like this thought-out
at the time, of course. Simply
a startled recognition, and
moving on. Even now the
thought is a bit ragged around
the edges, but it has kept
bobbing up, in one form or
another, ever since . . .
'T'here is a type of man, and
a good type, whom war
doesn’t seem to harm. It may
even round and complete him.
Even if he’s physically de-
stroyed, a matter of private
grief and some public loss, his
death seems, in a sense, fitting.
He has, anyway, lived.
There are others who, for
one reason and another, seem
to get the worst of both worlds.
Perhaps nothing can be done
about it —war, possibly, only
dramatises the notorious
injustice of nature. Justice,
after all, is a human concept,
of which, under optimum con-
ditions, we only get a rough
approximation.
Another type, who seem to
have all the equipment neces-
sary for moderate success in
peace or war, by concentrating
their energies in civilian
channels, have gathered large,
perhaps disproportionate,
rewards. There’s an assump-
tion nowadays that to say this
is bad taste, but, as a phe-
nomenon that has modified
national life after two world
wars, the rise of this class de-
serves more than passing men-
tion. Whoever calls attention
to it is in danger of being
accused of jealousy, or bitter-
ness, and, of course, no one

PAESANO
By "NIMROD"
Michele jumped down
into the mullock-
chute. The noise of
falling rock on steel
ceased; the clatter of the
cracker also stopped; even the
revolving screens rumbled to a
halt and the rubber belt was
still. The six men on the
crushing section stopped work,
grateful for the stone that had
jammed the outlet from the
mullock-chute.
The stone-pickers leaned
against the guard-rail, rolled
cigarettes, drank water and
talked. Michele jerked at the
offending rock with a bar;
Domenico de Pilato staggered
sulkily up the slope of the yard-
wide belt carrying a five-gallon
waterbag.
“What’s wrong with you,
Pontius?” called a little man
from the top end of the inclined
conveyor-belt. “You act as if
it was your first day instead of
your last. I’d be jumping with
joy if I was you.”
De Pilato didn’t answer.
Everyone knew that the pump
was on the bottom of the
pool; that the water stank; that
there was little enough of it
for them and none at all for
the mine. And anything else
was none of their business.
The rock which had been
blocking the mullock-chute fell
into the truck below with a rush
and a thump. Michele stepped
back onto the steel edge of the
chute, wiping the sweat from
his brow. The driver, from his
platform at the top of the belt,
pressed a button. The cracker
sprang into action; the revolv-
ing screens started with a
rumble that quickly became a
rattle as the asbestos-bearing
stone began to pour out of the
cracker; the stone-pickers
pulled on their leather gloves
and bent again to their work.
The noise reached a cres-
cendo until they were shut off
by a wall of sound. The limit
of their world was a 3ft.-wide,
endless path of broken rock,
uniformly grey with dust and
smelling of the clay of the
underground, flowing past at
60ft. a minute. From this they
had to pick rock in which
there was no seam of visible
asbestos, letting the rest flow
on through the cracker into the
mill. The mullock was dumped
in a chute behind them.
■pROM this chute Michele now
_ ran lightly down the mov-
ing belt and grabbed a shovel
to clean up the fallen rock from
the ground below. De Pilato
saw by his pursed lips that he
was whistling although he
couldn’t hear the tune. He
watched him moodily as he
stepped from rock to rock and
followed his movements down
to the Ross chains, inches-thick
links whose movement con-
trolled the flow of ore from the
big bin up above them onto the
lower end of the picking-belt.
He was still whistling.
But then, Michele was a fool.
He was always happy because
he didn’t know any better. He
had even been happy here on
the picking-belt, the lowest-
paid and most monotonous
work on the whole asbestos
mine.
And now the boss had offered
him a job underground at three
times the money.
Michele had refused. At
first. He said he was going
back to Italy with de Pilato.
“But why?” asked the boss
whom they called “The Red.”
“You can’t get the money in
Italy that you can here!”
“Mio paesano!’’ was all
Michele could say, shrugging
his shoulders and grinning.
“The Red” had watched the,
two of them as they had moved
off to work.
“Paesano!” he had heard him
say to the sampler. “Them
dings is like that. Always
stick together. It means some-
thing like mates or cobbers.”
But this morning Michele
had changed his mind. He had
gone back to the office and
accepted the job offered. And
he, Domenico de Pilato, son of
Pietro, was working his last
shift. He would be going back
to Italy alone.
Next week Michele would be
one of the miners. Domenico
used to watch the miners as
they went up the path to the
mine every morning and after-
noon; watched them again as
they returned at the end of
their shift, those in front hurry-
ing like boys to be first in the
showers; others stumbling down
like tired horses, not caring:
and the stragglers running to
catch up.
Their work was hard, but
once it was over they had a
good life. First away in the
bus back to town. Always
plenty to spend at the hotel or
two-up. No double shifts; no
weekend work. They made
enough without that —three
times as much as they did with
doublers and weekend work
thrown in.
It had taken him six months
to save £l5O. Some of the
miners saved that much in a
month. Six months to get his
fare back to Italy. Michele,
too. They worked every double
shift they could get. Every
afternoon they went to the
office to find out whether any-
one had missed the afternoon
shift. They worked every Fri-
day night they could and every
Sunday when they could get the
chance. Friday and Sunday
meant overtime.
“Pontius Pilate,” the boss
called him, “and his mate, Mick
Kelly; first cousin to Ned.
I’d hate to meet the pair of
you on a dark night,” he used
to say; “you’d cut a man's
throat for sixpence! The hun-
griest pair of bastards I ever
saw.”
But he, de Pilato, wasn’t
hungry. He liked to spend
money; he liked parties; he
liked a game of cards. But he
was eaten-up with hatred of
this place and drove himself to
work so that he could get out.
Himself and Michele.
'T'he flow of rock on the belt
in front of him fined down
to a trickle of tailings..
De Pilato looked up. There
was no more ore coming down
behind the Ross chains. He
caught a glimpse of red hair
over by the change-rooms.
From there “The Red” could
see every man working on the
picking-belt. In a second or
two de Pilato saw him come
from behind the shed, heading
straight for the belt.
His usually brown eyes were
browner still with anger and
frustration. The ore was low
in the bin and it was hard to
keep up a steady flow. He saw
Michele standing-by without
his miner’s helmet.
De Pilato couldn’t near what
the boss was saying, but he
could see his lips moving with
straight-lined force and he
knew that he was telling
Michele to put his safety-hat
on. He would be saying, “I’ve
told you before to keep your
hat on! One of these days
one of you scroungers will stop
one and I’ll be in the cactus.
Keep your hat on if you want
to keep this job.”
Then he strode away.
De Pilato felt a tinge of
satisfaction at the discomfiture
of his paesano. He knew that’
“The Red” wasn't worried
about the hat. Production was
his trouble. The mine had
been without water all morn-
ing, and without water the
miners couldn't bore into the
rock with their jackhammers,
so that now the mill would be
without ore if they didn’t send
a train quickly. Just the same,
it was good enoQgh for
Michele, who was a fool who
took unnecessary .risks.
The other went back to the
chains still whistling. If it
could be possible, he was
happiest capering around like
one of his mountain goats; he

cleared the mullock-chute for
fun, he ran up and down the
belt for the same reason, and
now he was clambering up the
chains.
Even on those Saturdays
and Sundays when they hadn't
worked Michele had loved to
climb the slopes of the gorges
and the rocks that overtopped
them. He, de Pilato, preferred
to loaf beside the pools in the
bottom of the gorge, or to
float on the surface watching
the black kites doing the same
thing in the upper air.
For a moment he forgot the
roaring, vibrating mill, the
dust-laden air, the dirt and the
stone, as he remembered the
pellucid water, the color of the
sky, the cliffs, the trees and the
stillness.
Once he had tried to paint
pictures of the rocks and hill-
sides of his native Umbria.
He felt for it, he was simpatico,
but he had not the skill.
But now you did not heed
skill: the other day a Pole
had showed him a camera, one
that would take a picture in
front of you in the colors
before your eyes. You no
longer needed to know the
science of color and the art of
applying it. The little box
did it for you.
And de Pilato could have it
for £100! That was two-thirds
of what he had in the bank.
One-hundred pounds was six
weeks’ work or more. Just for
a little box. But de Pilato
was a realist —he put the
thought away. He knew he
could not have that camera.
On moved the day. With
his head down and his
arms working automatically,
like pistons, Domenico was
free to feed his resentment
against
tinged with envy at the good
prospects that the underground
job offered.
If he had only had that
chance himself he might have
stayed another year or two
years to save enough to buy
a farm and vineyard in his
native province. A man' in
Italy with £lOOO or more could
live like a padrone. He
thought of all the things
Michele would be able to do.
And his friendship came very
near to hatred.
But his thoughts and
dreams were distracted. A
rumbling from the line that
ran along the cliff-face 50ft.
above told of an ore-train
approaching—the first for the
day. Even so, that didn't
account for why the little man
yelled like that. And why did
the others stare? Why did
they all start shouting down
the belt? He shrugged. These
Aussies—they were always
shouting. They were very
excitable.
Then he looked in the direc-
tion towards which they all
yelled. He saw the Ross
chains swinging. This meant
that Michele had climbed
them again to coax down the
last of the stone in the ore-
bin. Within a minute they
would empty the first truck
into the empty bin. The stone
would fall straight down the
chute past the swinging chains.
A foot appeared near the
bottom of the chains, groping
for a hold on the steel frame-
work. Up above, the little
electric loco, had pulled into
position. The pickers on the
belt were shouting up at the
loco.-crew. The crew took no
notice. The galvanised-iron
roof hid them from sight;
they wouldn’t hear above the
noise of the mill.
Then Michele’s cheerful face
appeared from behind the
chains. He grinned foolishly
up at his friends waving to
him—and waved back.
“Porca Madonna !” de Pilato
swore, jumped onto the belt
and ran towards Michele.
From up above came the
rumble of the first truckload.
Exactly at that moment the
first stone struck Michele. De
Pilato reached him in the next
minute and dragged the limp
figure off the belt onto the
ground.
The infirmiero came and
took Michele away in a jeep
to the hospital. He was still
unconscious when he left.
■jyTEXT day de Pilato went out
on the morning bus to
the mine office to get his last
pay.
“The Red” was waiting for
him when he arrived. He gave
him his envelope.
“You off on today’s plane?”
he asked.
De Pilato shrugged his
shoulders and turned his hands
palms upwards.
“Your paesano, eh?” asked
“The Red.”
De Pilato didn’t answer.
“It'll be a while before he’s
back at work,” said “The
Red.” He gave de Pilato a
quick look. “I don’t suppose
you’d take the job we offered
him yesterday?”
“Scusa ?” said de Pilato,
sparring for time.
“That job . . . Underground
. . . You want it?”
De Pilato wanted to think.
He put his hand in his pocket.
Then suddenly he nodded his
head vigorously. “Si! Si! I
try for a while!” he said, still

Who's Who in "Century's" Jesf-list
White Ties and Black Tales
When The Bulletin adopted its
present size three years ago
Sydney “Century” wisecracked
that it was “now twentieth-
century in format, but still eighteenth-
century in politics.” This was fair enough
comment from a paper which was
founded by Jack Lang, and which still
carries the Big Fella’s name over its
front-page leader. After all, The
Bulletin wasn't exactly flattering to
Jack in the days when his word was law
in N. S. Wales Labor politics.
“Century” itself has always been care-
ful not to specify, which century it repre-
sents, and it has often been difficult for
its readers to be sure which part of the
Labor party it supports.
In the beginning this was simple
enough ; it was designed to further the
cause of Lang and his followers. With
the disappearance of Lang Labor from
active politics its mission became rather
clouded, and although at intervals it still
prints notices of the annual meeting of
the “Australian Labor Party (Non-
Communist)” there is never any sugges-
tion that that body is a resurgent force
in either State or Federal politics.
“Century” has long been on the list
of The Bulletin’s favorite light-
reading. Untrammelled by any strict
party loyalty, it is able to throw its brick-
bats around with joyous abandon. Back
in the days of the Chifley Government
it instituted a weekly “open letter” to
the Prime Minister, couched in a banter-
ing style which at times succeeded in
being clever satire. When Menzies
became Prime Minister the feature was
continued, the only change necessary
being the .substitution of “Dear Bob”
for “Dear Ben.” Elsewhere in the paper
Menzies is “The Great White Father."
Readers of “Century” have to master
a simple code before they can fully
understand what they're reading, but they
soon get to know that “Awful” is short
for “Awful Arthur,” otherwise Federal
Opposition-leader Calwell. Similarly,
“Handsome Harold” is Federal Treasurer
Holt ; “Blowhard Billy” is N.S.W. Health
Minister Sheahan ; “The Man of Dis-
tinction” is Labor Senator McKenna ;
“Dr. Bob” is N.S.W. Premier Heffron.
Most of these names are of long stand-
ing, but in recent times a newcomer has
crept into the jest-list. This is “White
Tie and Tails,” otherwise E. G. Whitlam,
Labor’s new Deputy-leader.
Brickbats
Tn the final stage of Lang’s active poli-
lical career —he was M.H.R. for Reid
1946-49 and unsuccessfully stood for the
Senate in 1951—Chifley and Calwell were
his pet hates in Canberra, and Federal
Labor policy was generally under fire
in “Century.”
After Ben Chifley died and Dr. Evatt
was elected leader criticism became
much more selective. Calwell and
McKenna could be kicked hard and
often; so could anyone suspected of
Grouper tendencies. Charles Morgan,
who threw Lang out of the Reid seat
in 1949, was a fair target, and “Dilly
Dally” Daly could always be sure of an
adverse mention. So could “Little Boy
Lost” Stewart, who won the Labor
nomination for Lang (the Federal seat,
not J.T.) when Dan Mulcahy died.
In the N.S.W. Parliament, former
Premier McGirr always rated good
notices, but Cahill, Heffron, Sheahan and
Gus Kelly couldn’t take a trick.
Originally the “Century’s” brickbats
were neatly packaged in wittily decorated
wrappers. Nowadays the wit begins
and ends with the label. There also
seems to be a small and select plugola
list. It would be almost as hard to find
in “Century” files a harsh word about
Dr. Evatt as a kindly reference to Awful.
For Ward there is never anything but
praise, and the same may be said of
Haylen, Cairns and Clyde Cameron.
There has been much conjecture as
to the identity of the man who writes
the weekly article bearing J. T. Lang's
signature—almost as much as there was
concerning the authorship of his “auto-
biography,” Why I Fight. The innocent
suggestion that possibly J. T. Lang writes
them himself' is likely to provoke the
retort, “Yes, and I suppose you’d say
Joynton Smith used to write Why l
Publish ‘Smith’s Weekly.’”
Pen-friends Anonymous
/Curiosity is also expressed as to the
authorship of unsigned articles and
paragraphs in “Century.” That well-
known knowall, Common Belief, has
been saying for some time that Leslie
Haylen, M.H.R. for Parkes, is one of the
Great Unknowns. Haylen hasn't denied
it, though one would think that as a man
pledged to be loyal to the party-leader-
ship he would be eager to dissociate
himself from a paper publishing such
writings as:
Awful Arthur made a poor showing in
his speech on the South African crisis.
He is a political ignoramus on international
affairs, and whoever briefs him on those
subjects is no better informed. (8 /4/’60.)
The idea that Awful Arthur would
rejuvenate the Labor Opposition once he
took-over the leader's job has been shat-
tered. Caucus has never been so splintered
by factional intrigues and personal hates
and rivalries. (8/4/’60.)
White Tie and Tails Whitlam is becom-
ing more of the boy around the place
and less and less of the Party Deputy-
leader. (8/4/'60.)
Politically it could be said of him
[Whitlam] that he went through the Uni-
versity with his ignorance unimpaired.
(25/3/’60.)
Similar gems of unflattery stud the
pages of every recent issue of “Century,”
In the March 25 issue, of 12 pars, under
the heading “Canberra Circus,” nine
were devoted to denigrating the two
Labor leaders.
In contrast with the tone of these
items are the paragraphs (at least one
each week) extolling the sterling quali-
ties of Leslie Haylen —his common-
sense, his devotion to Labor principles
and his knowledge of defence and
foreign affairs.
It is clear that somebody in this
“Century” likes Haylen. His Parliamen-
tary colleagues, are probably the best
judges whether that somebody is Les
himself.
Another person nominated by Messrs.
Furphy and Hearsay as a “Century”
contributor is Allan Dalziel, for 20 years
Dr. Evatt’s private secretary. Calwell’s
takeover of the Doc's job didn't include
Dalziel, though it did include Joe Fitz-
gerald, Evatt's other secretary, a fact
which drew from “Century” bitter com-
ment on both Awful and Fitz.
Wrong Address?
I ast week all this seemed to be
flaring-up into one big bust-up. The
story was that Whitlam had written
to the Prime Minister complaining
that Dalziel, although no longer on
the Commonwealth payroll, was still
using the Federal members’ rooms in
Sydney, and that Minister for the Interior
Freeth had explained that Dalziel had
been doing electoral work for Haylen
and was entitled to use his office.
Trouble was forecast in caucus over
Whitlam's action. Putting it in
“Century” style, they didn't like White
Tie and Tails running to the Great White
Father, instead of to Awful Arthur or
to caucus. A dressing-down was pre-
dicted for White Tie and Tails.
Next came a report that Haylen
was to appear before a special com-
mittee of the A.L.P. to answer charges
of disloyalty—the committee consisting
of Calwell, Whitlam, and the president,
secretary and assistant-secretary of the
N.S.W. branch of the A.L.P. Haylen,
it seemed, was to be asked to explain and
to cease his association with Dalziel.
On Friday it was announced that
Dalziel would leave Haylen's employ-
ment at the weekend (at his own wish);
Calwell said no charges had been laid
against Haylen and he gave the impres-
sion that the reported “inquiry” was
really to be more of a friendly chat. At
the weekend there was doubt whether
even the chat would take place.
One truth, apart from all rumor and
hearsay, at any rate emerges from
the “Century” pars.—the bit about
factional intrigues and personal hates.
Inquiry or not, it seems that black ties
are indicated for someone ; but it isn't
clear yet who’ll be wearing ’em.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Flemington-on-mud
The odd showers and the
bitingly cold wind reduced the
crowd at Flemington on Satur-
day well below the 30,000 or
thereabouts which is now
normal for even unimportant
meetings at Melbourne’s city
tracks. Nobody wanted to
parade the lovely lawn, and at
one stage the frozen band
was valiantly performing to an
audience of two very small boys
and their infant sister.
With the Nationals in view
Hillwood's run in the Barkly
Hurdle was interesting. The
five-year-old Woodburn geld-
ing was having his first start
since winning last year’s Grand
National Hurdle, and the
double-figure odds suggested
he was a long way from being
at his top. And so the race
proved. Hillwood looked dan-
gerous from the half-mile to
the furlong-post, when he was
carting the field up to the
leader, Contador, but the very
heavy going took its toll, and
Hillwood only struggled home
into third place. With that run
under his belt, he will be worth
backing at his next few starts.
Hillwood’s run in no way
detracted from the merit of
Contador’s win. Only a four-
year-old, Contador was
having his first essay at
the jumping business. He took
the lead with a mile-and-
a-half to go, and cleared
his jumps like a veteran, to
coast home a winner by six
lengths. The display reflected
the twelve-months schooling
Joe Mulcahy has given Con-
tador. According to their views
expressed after the race, Mul-
cahy and owner D. J. S. Mac-
kinnon believe that Contador
will not be seasoned enough
for this year’s National. Hill-
wood, however, was only a
four-year-old when he won last
year.
Experienced racing men
said at Flemington that they
could not recall when the track
had been so heavy. It took
Fiero 1.20 to run the six fur-
longs of the first Dover Handi-
cap, but it took his opponents
considerably longer. Fiero’s
“Gol the gaff ready , Herman ?”
victory—by an official 10
lengths ; it looked a lot more
*—was one of the easiest wins
ever recorded down the
straight - six track. Fiero is
a three-year-old gelding by
Orgoglio (irrip.) from Rarcamba
by Helios (imp.) from Denis
Pop bv Denis Boy (imp.) from
Lady Pop.
On a day like last Saturday
it’s just as well to throw one’s
form-book away. On the face
of it, Djarrah did not have
much chance in the second heat
of the Dover Handicap, hav-
ing been easily beaten by Star
Banner at Warrnambool
earliep in the week, and Star
Banner had finished down the
track in the first Dover. All
that notwithstanding, Djarrah
cleared away to win on the
bit by six lengths. Djarrah is
trained at Warrnambool by
Kevin Lafferty, whose big
team of horses have had things
pretty much their own way in
the Western District for the
last decade. Lafferty brings a
lot of horses to Melbourne,
and he returns home with
spoils from the city more often
than not.
Incidentally, the Warrnam-
bool fixture at which Djarrah
was defeated was the three-
day Grand Annual Meeting,
one of the most interesting and
enjoyable fixtures on the Vic-
torian Calendar. Alec Fullar-
ton —now a trainer, but a few
years ago a fine Cross-country
hoop—trained Mudeet for his
wins in the two Steeple races,
the Brierley and the Grand
Annual itself. Fullarton
rounded-off a very pleasant
week by preparing Tinto to
win the Grassmere Steeple at
Flemington. The Grassmere
will probably be recorded in
the oddities of racing, because
the distance was reduced from
its advertised two miles and
half-a-furlong to 15 furlongs,
the stewards having decided
that the ground approaching
the first fence was unsafe.
Rules of racing in Victoria put
the minimum distance of a
steeplechase at two miles, but
a hastily-convened meeting of
the V.R.C. committee waived
the regulation. Tinto is owned
by Bill Graham, treasurer of
the Moonee Valley R.C.
It was mentioned here last
week that old Buzzie seems to
have webbed feet, and that
looked the case as he made
hacks of his opponents in the,
14-furlongs Cardinia Handi-
cap. Buzzie cleared-out at
barrier - rise and splashed
through the mud with all the
enjoyment of a small boy ; at
the finish his nearest opponent
was 10 lengths down the track.
Maori Prince, who showed a
lot of dash in the Sydney Cup,
found the reduced distance and
drop in class, in the mile-and-
a-half Terrace Handicap very
much to his liking. He carried
8.13 —a thumping weight in
the conditions —but always held
a prominent position and won
well, despite a strong chal-
lenge from Carbonella over the
last furlong. A year ago
Maori Prince won a hat-trick
of races at Flemington ; obvi-
ously he prefers winter going.
If ever a horse looked like
the logical favorite for a race,
it was Rising Rocket in the
Koorlong Handicap. The
Helios gelding had given a great
performance in the mud at
Moonee Valley the previous
week to defeat one of Aus-
tralia’s best wet-weather gal-
lopers, Malarno, and he duly
won with ridiculous ease. He
has now won three in a
row, and while the tracks are
in their present state he could
win more.

Sydney Racing
Heavily - backed Jack’s
Count was left the best part of
a dozen lengths at the start of
last Saturday's Warwick Farm
May Handicap. Mulley chased
after the field, overhauled
the back-laggers, was in the
middle group at the “six,”
and beat a few home. Tough
luck all round, because Jack’s
Count, in line for a hat-trick,
evidently had his head caught
somehow in the barrier. Com-
pass won the race, his first for
about 17 months, from North
Row and Yarrawin. N. Sell-
wood rode with his usual
skill to bring about a long
overdue change of luck for
connections of the Channel
Swell gelding.

races, among them running
fifth to Investigate at Rand-
wick after being second-last of
24 starters at the half-mile;
he had fairly flashed home
behind the placegetters.
Ridden by Jack Thompson he
won the Carlita by five lengths.
Time was only moderate, but
there was a strong head-wind
over the final furlong-and-a-
half. Black Hawk’s sire, Able
Seaman, has had many winners
in New Zealand, including the
three two - year - olds Sweet
Wren, Miss Able and Cruising.
Able Seaman won races- in
England at up to 12 furlongs.
Stylish Officer is one of his
best progeny.
Pan II (Fr.) had two winners
at ..the Farm Forest Echo
(favorite) in the Juvenile
Novice and Panic (20-to-l) in
the Three-year-old Novice.
Five days earlier at Newcastle
Forest Echo had set up a big
lead in a two-year-old sprint,
but had run right off the track,
and Primrose Lane beat him
easily. King of the Castle
again found six furlongs too
short; he could win at seven
furlongs or a mile.
«» • • •
Panic has now won a couple
of races and been placed a few
times, and maybe her best has
yet to be seen. Barry Leroy,
a country apprentice having his
first city ride, rode a deter-
mined - looking race, even
though the filly did cover a
lot of ground. Panic was one
of the last of the 21 starters
in the early stages, and was
still a long way from the
leaders at the home-turn, but
Leroy brought her with a fast
run down the outside to win by
half - a - length from King
“you don't have to keep THAT still Waiting for ducks."
Pharaoh and Lady Webb.
Harrier came from a long way
back for fourth money. Leroy,
who has ridden 26 winners in
the Moree district, where he's
apprenticed, is on loan to
Randwick trainer Harry Plant.
Panic’s pedigree points strongly
to staying power.
Greater hadn’t won a race
for the best part of two years
until he surprised in the War-
wick Flying, the six-year-old
Newtown Wonder gelding de-
feating favorite Front Cover,
with French Descent, also
heavily backed, in third possie.
Midget apprentice Colin
Underhill’s 71b. - allowance
brought Greater’s weight down
to 6.11. He took-on Front
Cover from the start, and that
didn’t suit Harry Plant’s free
mover, who rather likes things
his own way. French Descent’s
third was only so-so.
Rosehill trainer Tom Ken-
nedy placed Empress Fay right
when he took her out of the
Flying for a run in the Moore-
bank Handicap, under Welter
conditions, and she landed a
plunge which had reduced the
odds from eights to 9-to-2
second-favorite. Backers had
no worries, the four-year-old
mare travelling like a winner
all the way, and easily defeat-
ing favorite Exemption, with
the consistent Sea Hound third.
New Zealander Somain, backed
from fourteens to sixes, never
flattered supporters.
* * *
Randwick trainer Reg
Harris waited a long time
between wins, and then found
his runner, Ulola, a 7-to-4-on
favorite for the midweek
Canterbury Park Two-year-old
Maiden for fillies. Harris has
prepared many winners over
the years, and in this change
of luck had at least the
pleasure of seeing the filly
clear-out from opponents.
One more winner for Star
Kingdom (imp.), she’s from
Renewal by Veilmond from
Parapet by Brueghel (It.).
Winner of the same day’s
Two-year-old Maiden for colts
and geldings, Wire Service
balanced things in a way by
being at the opposite sort of
odds. Trained by Jack
Daniels, he’s a Globetrotter
(imp.) colt from Tiff by Talk-
ing from Lady Crag by
Felcrag (imp.).

The Trots
Victoria’s crack colt Opal
Chief beat Sydney champion
Soho Rose by three lengths in
brilliantly winning the final of
the N.S.W. Sapling Stakes at
Harold Park last Friday night,
running the mile in Austral-
asian record time, 2min.
6 4/ssec. Soho Rose made up
a lot of ground after
being slowly away, drew level
with Opal Chief, who was
doing it comfortably in front,
a couple of furlongs from
home, but couldn’t sustain the
run against such a good colt.
The win was Opal Chief’s
ninth in a row, the fine run of
success including the Victorian,
South Australian and N.S.W.
Sapling Stakes —a record right
out of the box. Victorian two-
year-olds have now won the
N.S.W. race five times since
1950 . . . Heats of the N.S.W.
Pacers’ Derby commence next
Friday night, with the £4OOO
final on the 20th.

Other Sports
“Insider”: Rugby Union
selectors’ choice of Ken Catch-
pole to captain N.S.W. was a
rare tribute, and it also showed
they are looking to the future
—he would be the only player
to captain N.S.W. after but one
season in grade football, and
he’s only 20. Something out of
the bag as a half-back, he is
strictly under the guidance of
Wallaby half-back and coach
Wal Meagher (Randwick), with
the result he's now a
brilliant match-winning half.
Four League clubs have already
offered him four-figure sums to
join them, but Catchpole won't
be tempted. He wants to finish
his studies at Sydney University
and tour the world with Union
teams. After that, maybe, he’ll
give consideration to pro.-foot-
ball offers.

remarkable record to his credit.
In 63 fights he has never been
on the canvas, or been in a

to intervene to save him from
unnecessary punishment. His

Svoronich has turned-down a

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
BRITAIN'S MISSILES
Commenting on the British
Government’s decision to
scrap its Blue Streak inter-
mediate-range ballistic missile,
the Defence Correspondent of
London “Sunday Times” notes
that “the British missile pro-
gramme has now reached a
point of categorical decision”:
“It is difficult to see how
the overall expenditure on
missilry by this country during
the past 12 years can be less
than £5OO-million sterling—it
may very well be more. What
have we got for that expendi-
ture?
“The first three of the five
weapons at present operational
were devised for a single task
—to bring down the high-
flying, high-speed bomber. To
achieve that objective we com-
mitted precisely the error for
which our services have
caustically criticised the Ameri-
cans. We divided our effort
three ways to meet individual
service wishes.
“Remember that these are
not simple missiles but missile-
systems, each with its indivi-
dual complement of target-
acquisition-radar and homing-
devices. To produce them,
three teams from our relatively
small pool of appropriately
equipped scientists and tech-
nologists have been withdrawn
for 12 years from alternative
fields.
Systems Suspect
“The systems they have pro-
duced are of suspect value.
Seaslug, the naval missile, is
clumsy in appearance and has
a relatively short range. It will
not in any case become
genuinely operational until the
completion of the related
shipbuilding programme at
least two years from now, by
which time it must inevitably
be obsolete.
“Thunderbird, the Army’s
mobile anti-aircraft weapon, is
officially admitted to be sus-
ceptible to known radar
counter-measures.
“Bloodhound, the R.A.F.
counterpart, emplaced in two
sites in East Anglia, lacks
speed and is alleged to be
severely affected by weather-
conditions.
“It would appear, then, that
three separate programmes
have after 12 years failed to
find a solution to a single initial
problem.
“That a single solution
might have been possible is
suggested by the fact that the
Americans with Talos have
developed a weapon with at
least a comparable range,
almost certainly a greater
hitting-power, and the capa-
bility of being used both at
sea (for which it was devised),
on land, and as an effective
surface-to-surface weapon.
“There is another unsatis-
factory aspect. Because of
the inordinate time taken to
produce these relatively simple
weapons, the original require-
ment has altered drastically.
The development of the stand-
off bomb makes it in a high
degree improbable that enemy
aircraft in any major war will
need to come within range of
missiles of the Seaslug variety

hope of delivering by British

ing to blame the divisions
between the services. But the
real trouble is that the whole
programme is misguided. Co-
operatively the services might
have produced more efficient
defence-weapons; but they
would still have been valueless,
because attack has far out-
stripped defence.
“So long as it was a question
of bringing down the maxi-
mum number of attacking
bombers, orthodox defence-
weapons—fighters, ground-to-
air missiles, air-to-air missiles
—had some point. But the
moment it becomes necessary
to bring down all intruders,
whether flown-in or rocket-
propelled, then even the most
elaborate orthodox defence-
system must break down.
“If the best ground-to-air
missiles available were to be
spaced every few miles around
the English countryside at a
cost of uncountable billions,
with every citizen in the coun-
try deployed to man the bases,
we still could not be sure that
one stray H-bomb would not
slip through; and one could
be enough.
“There is an unanswerable
case, then, for abandoning the
attempt to make defensive
weapons designed to bring
down enemy bombers or
guided missiles. And the case
against throwing more millions
into the pursuit of an offensive
missile, capable of lobbing
H-bombs into Russia, is almost
as strong—and for the same
reasons,
Uncertainty the Deterrent
“What will deter the Rus-
sians, or anybody else, from
starting a nuclear bombard-
ment is uncertainty. They
would need to be 100 per cent,
sure that no bomber can fly
over Moscow ; that no nuclear
submarine can emerge from
under the icecap and demolish
Leningrad. And they cannot
be 100 per cent. sure. They
cannot even be certain that,
at this moment, some nuclear
weapon is not concealed in an
apartment in a Moscow
suburb, waiting to be set-off
as a reprisal (the exact locality,
after all, matters little pro-
vided the bomb is dirty
enough).
“Accurate missiles are not
essential. The threat is suffi-
cient. Even if it were insuffi-
cient, of course, there would
still be an unanswerable case
against the policy of the

independent deterrent, on
strategic as well as on econo-
mic grounds.”
While agreeing with this,
London “Economist” holds,
that it “is not to say, as the
anti-bomb campaigners say,
that Britain should abandon
its nuclear weapons altogether ;
since we know how to make
H-bombs, there may well be
a case for continuing to make
them for a collective Western
stockpile.
“Nor is it to say that we
can straightaway cut-down our
defence-bill. Effective inter-
dependence with our allies
would certainly be cheaper
than effective independent
deterrence (if that were pos-
sible, which it is not) ; but
whether it would cost us a
penny less than the £l5OO
million a year that we have
recently been spending on
ineffective national defence and
Nato is a much more open
question. The answer can be
determined only by the needs
of true collective defence, and
here technological advance
may not work on our side.
“There is an evident danger
that if and when America can
rely on the deterrent power of
intercontinental missiles for its
own immunity, it might
become less ready to take
risks for the safety of Europe
than when it depends on
European bases. This is some-
thing that British policy should
seek to guard against at any
cost.
Britain and Europe
“One obvious moral is that
every possible measure to
fortify the American alliance
must be relentlessly pursued.
But a second way to mitigate
the danger would be to throw
British technology behind the
deterrent power of Europe as
a strong military entity in itself.
“For some years past it has
seemed an obvious course for
Britain to co-operate with our
allies in mounting the deterrent
on the Continent —where it
could be mobile and where the
shorter ranger to Russia would
make the use of existing
missiles (or those that are near-
certainties) far more prac-
ticable than present dreams
about Polaris.
“The problem that Britain
faces is exactly parallel with
the problem with which
General de Gaulle is now
grappling at Camp David. If
Britain does not at the eleventh
hour take the lead in develop-
ing a collective deterrent on the
Continent, it may come about
anyhow- —and then the day
may come when Europe has
a valid deterrent and America
has a valid deterrent, and
Britain enjoys splendid isola-
tion with a fleet of ageing
V-bombers and a wastepaper-
basket full of plans. This
might delight the unilateral
disarmers ; but it would be an
extraordinary denouement for
Conservative defence-policy.”
Malayan All-clear
'T'he ending of the 12-year-
A old state of emergency in
Malaya, which is to become
official on July 31, is seen by
London “Daily Telegraph” as
“a singular triumph for Tengku
Abdul Rahman, the Prime
Minister, whose Administration
since the grant of independence
in 1957 has been a model of
firmness and moderation.
“Yet while due tribute should
and will be paid to the present
rulers of Malaya, justice de-
mands that a lion’s share of the
credit shall be given to those,
British and others, who fought
the Communist terrorists in the
jungle for nine long years
before ‘Merdeka.’
“How hard th&t fight was
can be judged from the emerg-
ency’s toll of more than 10,000
lives, including those of some
2000 policemen and service-
men and 2000 civilians; more
than 6000 terrorists have been
killed.
“It was the great upsurge of
national spirit under the
dynamic leadership of Sir
Gerald Templer that turned the
tide; nor should we forget the
spadework done under his pre-
decessor, Sir Henry Gurney,
himself a victim of terrorist
murder.
“It would be rash to suggest
that Malaya’s Communists are
crushed. They will revert to
tactics of infiltration and sub-
version, and here they may be
more dangerous than in arms.
Moreover, the neighboring ter-
ritory of Singapore, with its
predominantly Chinese Left-
wing Government, remains a
question-mark.
“But a phase has ended, and
ended in unqualified victory.
A deliberate and determined
attempt to capture an Asian
country for Communism has
been defeated in the field. It is
a useful reminder that not all
the problems presented by
nationalism can be solved by
appeasement.”
However, notes London
“Economist,” the present Ad-
ministration does not intend
“to rely wholly on normal
processes of law” to keep the
country clear of Communism:
“The Constitution is to be
amended to give the Govern-
ment the power of preventive
detention without trial —and
thus what was always supposed
to be the most detested feature
of colonial rule becomes a
permanent institution of an-
other independent Common-
wealth State. It is a pity, but
British liberals are getting
hardened to it.”
Also, the same paper adds,
“Malaya is a plural society, and
the experiment under which the
three races live together is still
new. The Chinese community
is. getting stronger and qualify-
ing for the vote in ever larger
numbers, while Malay progress
is still slow.
“Tension between the races
is therefore latent, and the
Government evidently feels that
it cannot entirely disarm. What
effect this will have on the
appeal of Communist propa-
ganda remains to be seen.”
Brasilia
/Commenting on the opening
of Brazil’s new capital—
situated in. what was previously
uninhabited country about 600
miles inland from Rio de
Janeiro,, the former seat of
government —London “Finan-
cial Times” notes that “the
building of Brasilia has been
written into the Constitution of
Brazil since time immemorial”
and that “it would be churlish
as well as philistine to judge the
new capital by the strict
criteria of the cost-accountant.
“In any case the statistics
evidently do not exist for a
precise judgment along these
lines. But even if they did —
even if a firm basis existed for
an assessment of the cost of
Brasilia so far —it is not easy
to see how these could be
translated into a meaningful
accountant’s appraisal of the
position.
“Who is to say whether Can-
berra has proved a profitable
investment for the Australian,
or Ankara for the Turk?
Decisions about capitals can-
not be taken on business
grounds alone. They may well
be justified (after the event) if,
by acting as a focus and
symbol of new popular aspira-
tions and a new order, they are
able to release latent forces of
advancement and enterprise
among the people. This was
particularly true of Ataturk’s
new capital at Ankara. There
is a reasonable long - term
chance that it will happen in
the case of President Kubils-
chek’s Brasilia.
“Nevertheless, it has to be
conceded that the establish-
ment of a new capital does
nothing to solve the pressing
economic problems which
Brazil, along with almost all
other South American coun-
tries, is now facing. It does
nothing to check the country’s
galloping inflation: if anything,
it is likely to increase it. More
generally, the problem of com-
bining economic growth with
stable prices will probably re-
main to be solved long after
the last Government office has
been established in the new

capital. And as the present
Argentine Government has
found, to the loss of its elec-
toral popularity, the austerity
measures when they are even-
tually taken tend to be ex-
tremely painful.
“What Brasilia might con-
ceivably do, however, is bring
home to the capital exporting
nations, and particularly the
U.S., the vast growth-potential
of the Brazilian and South
American markets.
“There is considerable irrita-
tion in the South American
countries with what is regarded
as neglect on the part of Wash-
ington of the underdeveloped
areas at its back-door. Political
considerations and the appar-
ent popularity of Senor Castro’s
regime in Cuba apart, it would
be a great mistake if the inter-
national business community
were to continue to overlook
South America, especially since
the recent moves to establish a
common-market there.”
Japanese
Design Centre
To people who believe that
the Japanese have no gift
for original industrial design
but are mere copyists, the open-
ing in Tokyo of the Japan
Design House should, notes
Bradford “Wool Record,”
demonstrate “that the Japanese
can, in fact, institute expert in-
dividual designs of their own
which owe little or nothing to
ideas originating elsewhere.
“The Japan Design House is
intended as a permanent exhibit
of representative indigenous
products which show clear
evidence of good design and
quality. An offspring of
J.E.T.R.O.j the Japanese Ex-
port Trade Promotion Agency,
which has branches in many
parts of the world, the Design
House is subsidised by the
Japanese Government to the
extent of 5-million yen.
“One exemplary condition
which must be adhered to
before any article may be
shown,” the same paper adds,
“is that the design shall be
original. If doubts are cast on
originality the exhibit is im-
mediately withdrawn.
“An elaborate card-indexing
system is said to be one of the
best features of the scheme,
giving instant details of what
is made and the names of
makers of many thousands of
industrial products and con-
sumer-goods.
“Used in conjunction with
the textile-design centre in
Osaka and the pottery-design
centre in Nagoya, the Japan
Design House should do much
to improve the reputation of
Japan in the export market, for
it is undoubtedly realised now
in high places in that country
that piracy of design exacts a
big price in lost national good-
will even though it may afford
to an individual a quick im-
moral profit.”
Red Population
the “New York Times”:
“Soviet statisticians have
been projecting population
trends at home and abroad 15
years into the future, and they
don’t like what they see.
“That seems a fair inference
from an article the head of
the Soviet Central Statistical
—London “Observer.”
“ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS PARTICULAR MISSILE
WAS VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY.”
Administration, V. N. Starov-
sky, has recently published.
Powerful forces are at work to
reduce still further the Soviet
birthrate, he notes, listing
such factors as the declining
number of women who will
enter the fertile-age brackets
in the years ahead and the
increasing urbanisation of the
Soviet population.
“Since Mr. Starovsky’s
article was printed in the organ
of the Academy of Sciences
many of his readers were un-
doubtedly sharp enough to see
that the data he presented
show that not only is Com-
munist China’s birthrate and
rate of natural increase higher
than that of the Soviet Union
but that Peking’s still relatively
high deathrate offers substan-
tial possibilities for reduction,
with consequent acceleration
of its rate of natural increase.
“Five years ago, Mr. Starov-
sky noted, Premier Khrush-
chev said that even if the
Soviet population were to
increase by 100-million persons
to 300-million or so, that
would still be little. The reason
the Soviet Union’s chief
statistician, looking ahead to
1975, felt called upon to
remind his readers that Premier
Khrushchev wants more babies
becomes apparent if we do a
little calculation based upon
Mr. Starovsky’s data.
“His discussion suggests that
over the next 15 years annual
Soviet population-increase will
probably be between 3-million
or 4-million persons, equiva-
lent to a 1975 population-range
of roughly 255- to 2.75-million
persons. But Communist
China’s population, even if it
continues to rise by only 2 per
cent, annually, would be well
over 850-million persons.
“Put another way, the pros-
pective population-increase in
Peking’s land between now and
1975 could well be about as
great as the present Soviet
population. But the Soviet
Union has roughly three times
the land area of its southern
neighbor. The contrast
between the two nations’
wealth in resources and popu-
lation would seem something
worth meditating upon, and
not only in Moscow and
Peking.”

Manchester “Guardian”: “A
repertory-theatre director has
cut out every reference to South
Africa from a Noel Coward
comedy, and has replaced them
with references to Australia.
He explained: “If I had left it
as it was, it would have been
in very bad taste.’
“Oldham Repertory Theatre
Company is presenting Noel
Coward’s ‘Present Laughter,’
which is about an actor prepar-
ing for an African tour.
“The director of produc-
tions, Mr. Carl Paulsen, said:
‘My main concern was with
good taste. I was not happy
about presenting a play full of
wisecracks and references about
South Africa. So I changed
every mention of that country.
This is not a political gesture,
although I am as horrified as
anyone else at recent happen-
ings in South Africa.’ ”

London “Daily Mail’’: “The
plan for a Channel Tunnel is

it comes to anything must
depend upon the approval of
Governments and the confi-
dence of investors. But the
fact that it is being seriously

indicates once again that Britain
is drawing ever closer to
Europe.
“There are already several
important cross-Channel links.
One is the cable for the
exchange of electric power
between Britain and France.
Another is Eurovision. A third
consists of scientific collabora-
tion. Within the past few
weeks plans have been outlined
for Anglo-French co-operation
in aircraft production, missiles
and electronics.

that only the largest, most self-
contained nations can stand
alone.”

New York “Herald Tribune”:
“If the Algerian revolution
ever had any claims to the
sympathy and respect of out-
siders it was not as a military
undertaking but as an expres-
sion of nationalism and self-
determination such as has
swept most of the former
colonial world. And when the
present F.L.N. leadership seems
more concerned with perpetuat-
ing its own role and transform-
ing itself into the new Algerian
governing class than with taking
the steps that can lead to self-
determination, outsiders may
be pardoned for doubting both
the motives and direction of
the rebellion.”

London “Spectator": “It is
surprising how little attention
has been paid here [Britain] to
the broadcast made by M.
Debre, the French Prime Minis-
ter, when he returned to Paris
from his brief visit to Algeria.
This was the first time that the
i’s had been officially dotted
and the t’s authoritatively
crossed of President de Gaulle’s
declaration last September of
the policy of self-determination
for Algeria.
“Secession, declared the
Prime Minister, means parti-
tion. In other words, if the
Moslems of Algeria wish to
govern their country in their
own way they are to be denied
the ports and the productive
capacity that would make that
economically possible. The
colons, on the other hand, are
to be rewarded for their intran-
sigence by being granted the
richest region of Algeria and
spared the economic responsi-

“Spectator”: “Cyprus, when it

island has only half-a-million
inhabitants, but it will beVthe
only Middle Eastern State
which is uncommitted in the
Middle East’s private cold war,
and so worth capturing for
either side. It will be the seat
of the only remaining British
bases in the Eastern Mediter-
ranean, bases from which, pre-
sumably, British intervention
would be directed in the event
of any further flare-up in the
Middle East in which Britain
came to be involved, either in
protection of her own interests
or as a result of her treaty
obligations. It will stand in
need of technical assistance in
developing its adequate but
largely untapped resources, and
as development proceeds it will
constitute a worth-while market
for consumer-goods and light-
industrial equipment. And as
long as the cold war persists in
the Middle East, Cyprus will be
the obvious listening-post for
both sides.”

London “Sunday Times”:
“We [Britain] have much to
learn from France in respect
of our attitude to Germany.
General de Gaulle has con-
tinued his predecessors’ policy
of friendly relations with West
Germany, France’s neighbor
and ally in Nato. The French
have been far readier than we
have been to forget old hates
and fears; they believe the
young democracy next-door
should be encouraged by friend-
ship and confidence, and not
soured by constant suspicion
and abuse.
“For us to suppose that it is
to our disadvantage, perhaps
even dangerous, that France
and West Germany should
form a close relationship is
antiquated nonsense. Britain’s
policy should be to develop
close, friendly relationships
with both France and West
Germany. It is to be hoped
that General de Gaulle’s in-
spiring utterances in London
will give an impetus to this kind
of thinking in Britain.”

wants that; we’re all terribly
afraid of labels.
In my own case, I can only
hope the accusation isn’t true.
Difficult to know, of course
-—there’s a bit of the-fox-with-
his-tail-cut-off in most of us.
On the other hand, the fields
in which this sort of success is
most conspicuous politics,
finance, administration are
not ones to which I’d normally
aspire. I'd go so far as to say
that writing is one of the few
trades (surgery, for a qualified
man, is another) in which war-
experience can be of direct,
commercial value. The fact
that I haven't, so far, made a
conspicuous success of it is
beside the point. The lure is
there. It helps to keep you
going, like a pug's conviction
he’ll make the big-time. If
confidence doesn’t crack,
there’s always a chance of
writing a best-seller . . .
“Diding up to the Monastir
the two - pounder
wagging behind—they weren’t
any good against heavy tanks,
anyway ; after we were in the
bag they switched to heavier
stuff —we were thoughtful be-
cause we knew, everyone in
the regiment knew, that the
campaign was foredoomed.
You only had to look at the
map. All Jerry had to do was
move his armored divisions
down through Yugoslavia, and
that was that.
The Yugoslavs might hold
him? Ha-ha! That was the
last war. Later, when we saw
something of the Yugoslav
Army’s equipment, we knew
how laughable it was, even
without the internal troubles
that flared-up at the time of
the invasion. Croat against
Serb, other groups more or
less embroiled ; Albanians
raiding across the border.
Real warriors, the Albanians,
they had a crack at everyone.
A crowd of them were brought
into Nish, in Serbia, when we
were there, turbaned fellows
unpopular with Germans and
local population alike. Later
I heard they had all been shot.
This was the Balkans.
Not that the Yugoslav
soldier couldn’t fight. But, like
us, he wasn’t equipped for
modern warfare. In fact, he
was much less well-equipped.
Not long before that an
Australian politician had
visited the Middle East and
said something absurd about
how well-equipped the Aus-
tralian troops were. An Aus-
tralian general reminded him
of it, after the war, in a signed
letter to a Melbourne news-
paper, so there’s no need for
me to labor the point. It’s
sufficiently established, I think,
that we were not well-
equipped, and that that mem-
ber of Cabinet was talking
dangerous nonsense.
T ater, in the long spell of
*- J thinking we had in Ger-
many, we tried to apportion
the blame. We fairly early got
over the stage of wanting to
shoot the generals, and sorted
out the politicians.
All shades of political
opinion were represented, as
I’ve said, and at times party-
feeling ran strong. But in the
free-for-all everyone got a
hearing, particularly if he
shouted, and the final con-
sensus of opinion, I think, was
that both political parties had
been almost criminally negli-
gent. They were. Perhaps
they still are.
The last is a sobering
thought. Because, back there
in the Stalag political-clubs,
after kicking the politicians
around a bit, we finally got to
thinking that perhaps we, per-
sonally, had been a bit to
blame, too, since we’d elected
them —those who had a vote. I
hadn’t yet voted, and, if I’m
not mistaken, I was particu-
larly virtuous about what I’d
do with it when I got back.
Strangely enough, we weren’t
disposed to blame Churchill
for Greece. We—my particu-
lar group, anyway—had been
sure the campaign was a mis-
take, but after we were cap-
tured we persuaded ourselves
there was some master-stroke
of strategy involved which we
couldn’t comprehend. It was,
perhaps, an endeavor to con-
vince ourselves we had served
a useful purpose. Besides,
Churchill was a symbol of
resistance, of eventual victory.
How a man manages to be
that to a nation is one of the
mysteries of mass psychology,
but he was. And a man who
could win a war could be for-
given for losing a campaign.
For all that, the working-
class Tommies were realistic
about Churchill. I was a little
shocked to discover that, at
this early stage, they were
calmly planning to vote him
out of office after the war. He
was a proper old Tory, really,
they said —and you felt that
they were secretly delighted at
his Toryism, as a manifestation
of a forthright personality.
They felt they knew where
they were with him. They felt
confident he was for winning
the war first, with party loyal-
ties a bad second. After the
war —as you were! There was
something impressive about
this weighing of issues, at that
time. Our own discussions of
Australian politicians were
more acrimonious . . .
Oymbol of victory or not,
Greece was a mistake. The
notion that great men don’t
make mistakes is a growing
modern superstition, and a
dangerous one. A spread of
the cult of personality, per-
haps.
The Greek campaign was a
mistake, most of all, for the
Greeks. There is something
magical about that land —a
total, perhaps, of its history
and the light—and a delightful
simplicity about its people,
who, poor as they are, under-
stand the art of living. They
have a zest for life—which,
perhaps, is the reason for their
ancient insistence on balance,
harmony, the golden mean.
They needed it as a corrective
in art, for they were a passion-
ate' people. They could have
gone on fighting their gallant
little war with the Italians for
a long time. Then we arrived,
and were hailed as deliverers.
Then the armored columns.
Churchill's old regiment, the
4th Hussars, was in Greece,
incidentally. Later I met a
few of the 4th Hussar boys
(their steeds were light tanks).
Randolph Churchill hadn’t
gone to Greece with his unit.
Later he parachuted into Yugo-
slavia and conferred with Tito,
which had the effect of switch-
ing Allied support from the
Serb Royalist, Mikhailovitch,
to the Croat Communist,
Tito. Taken all round, the
Churchill family’s influence on
the Balkans in War II wasn't
happy . . ,

we did in Germany was sit
around cursing our leaders and
our fates. We did many things,

To answer, off the cuff, that
common question, “What was

the majority, by surrendering
some liberties, ensuring others,
all perfectly demonstrated, as
that marvellous old Greek,
Plato, had explained it; as he
had dryly commented on the
loyalty that binds bands of
robbers and soldiers, decreas-
ing as it expands.
The great men in Germany,
in my opinion, were not the
spectacular ones. Of the Aus-
tralians I knew, John Mc-
Tigue and lan Sabey were two
who exerted great influence.
There were others of the
same stamp, of proved physi-
cal courage, whose moral
courage and integrity made
them leaders. It’s my opinion
you find the same type
scattered throughout the armed
services, and through the com-
munity, but opportunity
doesn’t always discover them.
A Bulletin contributor, a
British Regular Army officer
and the son of a Regular Army
officer, in a paragraph men-
tioned that in his father’s day
an officer who went on the
staff was considered “ambi-
tious.” There was something
of the same psychology in the
ranks of the Australian Army,
I think, regarding promotion,
which partly explains why
some first-class officer-material
never got commissions, and
why some incompetents did.
Another factor was the age-
level —some splendid leaders
were not exactly wasted, but
not fully utilised, as n.c.o.s,
because they were a few years
too old.
John McTigue I have singled
out. lan Sabey, an Adelaide
journalist before the war, was
a W. 0.11. At T Beach, before
he was relieved by Major
Carey, a Tank Corps officer,
he organised and led a brisk
rearguard action in which
practically a brigade was in-
volved. The reason is rather
disgraceful —he couldn’t find
an officer to do the job.
Morale was at a low ebb. lan
raised it. He raised and sus-
tained it every day he was a
p.-0.-w.
When he came back he
charged an officer —who, in
the meantime, had been pro-
moted and decorated —with
desertion in the face of the
enemy. What happened makes
an interesting story, which he
tells in a book he wrote. The
last I heard of him he was
chief public-relations officer
for T.A.A.
There is no point in reviving
the disgraceful side of the
Greek campaign, except as a
warning. Because there could
be another war ; troops could
go into action again, on ill-
advised campaigns, poorly
equipped, some of them
scarcely trained, some badly
led.
Picking leaders is a difficult
job, admittedly—one sees it
more clearly in retrospect. A
general was once kind enough
to explain to me —after the
war —on a Manly ferry, how,
of necessity, those on top can
only look quickly at certain
externals. And then you never
know until the test comes.
But something could be done
about training and equipment,
and it’s more than likely, if the
test comes, these will be found
wanting, again.
It’s the sort of thing one
can’t be dogmatic about with-
out inside knowledge, which I
don’t pretend to have. But it’s
the sort of thing a lot of us
promised ourselves we’d take
an interest in, when we came
back —I can’t say I’ve done
that, either. Nor have most
of my friends. But interested
civilians can, at least, ask
questions.
I did have a spell in the
C.M.F., and that wasn’t
reassuring. There were some
excellent Regular Army officers
and n.c.o.s, any amount of
keenness, but a sort of nervous
twitch, with which I was
unpleasantly familiar. Some-
thing wrong up top. One week
we were embarked on one
scheme of training ; next week
that was scrubbed. Again,
there was a waste of effort,
waste of enthusiasm.
Which recalls, among other
things, an “Other Fellow’s
Mind” item by “Ex-R.S.M.”
on training-methods, in which
he said that the tendency is to
do everything with a weapon
except fire it. That was my
experience, during the war and
after. As a contrast, there was
the sight of German troops,
when a convoy was held-up,
blazing away at petrol-tins.
They were well-trained troops,
and could handle their
weapons . . .
T>ut war, after all, is only
** one side of the question. In
those long talks we had, just
about everything was debated,
including politics. I had two
impressions: one, that the
average Australian was a
pretty sound fellow ; two, that
there were many things that
we would have to take in hand
when we came back.
I can’t say we have. I’ve
looked hopefully at some of
the younger M.P.s, but so far
I’ve seen no evidence of elec-
tric political vision. I’ve waited
for some of those natural
leaders I’ve known to make
their mark in public life, but
none of them has. Perhaps
they’re not that way inclined.
Perhaps the rest of us have
been to blame for not taking
enough interest.
I’m not advocating govern-
ment by ex-soldiers, or cabals
from ex-servicemen organisa-
tions. But the proportions
seem to be a bit lopsided in
the political field—against ex-
service.
Perhaps part of the reason
lies in the general emphasis
on the returned serviceman to
“fit in,” when he came back ;
to “adjust himself” to civilian
life ; to conform. Maybe a few
things in civilian life needed
adjusting.
Another factor, I think, is
the deep scepticism many men
acquired for the printed word.
After all, we were subjected to
a pretty solid dose of propa-
ganda, some thick as lard,
some subtle ; and some of the
stuff that passes as political
comment strikes us as puerile.
I can admire the professional
dexterity of a writer who gets
a news-flash about an indus-
trial dispute and sits at his
typewriter and dashes-off a
leader condemning a wicked
strike, but I can’t understand
anyone taking it seriously.
Any more than I can see how
the leader by his opposite-
number across the street, con-
demning a wicked lock-out,
can be other than rubbish.
How do they know ? What
facts have been investigated,
when the papers are on the
street so soon after the event?
Dut these, perhaps, are only
** excuses. The tools at hand
have to be used. Most of us
have been too lazy, or too
busy, to use what knowledge
we have gained, sometimes
painfully.
Taking it all round, it’s a
pretty good country, and won-
derful things could be done
with it. But to pretend every-
thing is wonderful, now, as
some well-meaning peeole do,
strikes me as silly.
Everything isn’t well with
defence ; everything isn’t well
with development, particularly
a part closely linked with
defence —rural development.
All sorts of ingenious rea-
sons have been given for the
lag in home-building, but there
is a lag—in a country which
escaped the immediate damage
of war. And usury has gained
an unhealthy prestige.
Looking back, the two big
things done in this country
since the end of the war on a
Governmental level have been
the immigration-scheme and
the Snowy Mountains Scheme.
Both started by one Govern-
ment and continued by another.
Which reinforces my opinion
that, boiled down, there isn’t
a great deal of difference be-
tween the main parties when
there is commonsense and
goodwill on either side.
The tendency to fix labels
on people is a dangerous one.
One reason why I think war-
experience is an asset to a man
in public life is that it is
harder to think that a man
who wears a different sort of
collar to work, does a different
job, is an enemy of the
working-class, or a dangerous
radical, after the shake-up of
service-life.
It also, I think, makes men
less sensitive to criticism.
Sooner or later, in the Army,
you learn that life doesn’t
revolve around you. That, at
least, has been my experience.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Engineers tell me that rail-
roads are much more costly
than roads; then there is the
upkeep, loco.-sheds and strikes
(roads cannot strike). Nowa-
days more people outback
travel by car than by train;
also, the big trailers can take
more freight. You ought to
see the trucks and cars that
use the Alice-Darwin bitumen.
In every way roads for the out-
back are more convenient than
railways.
I am glad that Tilghman
raised the point of crossing
those big Lake Eyre rivers in
flood-time. There is some talk
of making a road from Mount
Isa to Alice Springs, and I
expect they would have to cross
the Georgina somewhere about
Uandangie, where the river is
enormous in flood-time. The
problem can be met in this
Beef-cattle
I disagree with D. C. Tilgh-
man (B. 27/4/’6O) that the
beef-cattle industry’s need is
fo>- railways.
The fundamental fact to
grasp about this industry is
that it is backward and waste-
ful. The real problem is one
of low rate of production.
Beef-growers must learn to
fodder-grow their cattle, then
they will understand why roads
are better than railways.
We don't necessarily need
cattle-trains; we need local
killing-places for airborne beef,
the blood and offal to be
turned into fertiliser to top-
dress the soil.
“I wish you'd stop tracing my husband !”
way, when you understand the
nature of those rivers. They
don’t flow along in well-defined
channels, but in a series of
billabongs and flooded plains.
Hence the name Channel
Country.
We will have to build a weir-
road at the lower end of one
of those waterholes, where the
river converges. The road
would serve a double-purpose—
a roadway and a weir to store
water in the enormous water-
holes. This water could be
used for sprinkler-irrigation.
Tilghman mentions Win-
dora. I know the town well
and the bridge over the Cooper.
In fact, I unofficially opened
that bridge some years ago,
and I suggested to the engineer
that they ought to have made
it a weir-bridge. What an
enormous storage of water
would have been there!
Michael Sawtell (N.S.W.).
Spell As You Please?
“Doynest” (B. 27/4/’6O) is
right, of course, in stressing the
need “to teach children to read
fluently and to write good
English.” It is important that
reading, oral and written ex-
pression and spelling should be
closely related; but the teacher
will have little success if he
depends too much on incidental
learning—one of the dangers of
this idea of correlating sub-
jects, particularly in the case
of spelling.
However, I can’t agree that
there is any evidence to support
“Doynest's” claim that those
taught reading by a “Look and
Say” method spell better than
those taught by phonics. lam
not convinced that the method
used for teaching reading has
any great influence op spelling,
although Fles c h, in Why
Johnny Can't Read, published
in America a few years ago,
argues that phonics pupils make
better spellers.
“Doynest” refers to English
as a “hopelessly non-phonetic
language.” This widely - held
view is simply not true, even
though English is much less
phonetic than other languages.
If he cares to have a look at
his own first two paragraphs he
will find that most of the
words he used —75 per cent, on
my count —are spelt and pro-
nounced according to fixed
rules.
Reference to the spelling
superiority of the junior clerks
of a generation ago over those
of today surely supports
Flesch’s view, stated above,
rather than “Doynest's.” It is
“Look and Say” which is the
modern method, not phonics.
I don’t know when the
former supplanted phonics in
Australia, but suspect it was in
the late ’thirties, following the
1928 publication in America of
Gates’s influential book New
Methods in Primary Reading.
Queensland has just intro-
duced “Look and Say.” It has
the reputation, I understand,
for being the last State to adopt
modern educational techniques,
which perhaps accounts for its
relatively high standards in
reading, arithmetic and spell-
ing.
Spelling must be taught
directly, not merely incident-
ally, using all sensory chan-
nels, and prescribed lists based
on frequency-counts of the
words children need to write.
Interest is indeed the most
important factor in learning,
but, if this is difficult to arouse,
repetition will achieve moder-
ate success.
Repetition is unpopular
these days, personal lists
of errors are favored in place
of set lists. These are almost
useless on their own, except in
the hands of the bright, en-
thusiastic pupil.
Finally, “Doynest” exagger-
ates, I think, the English in-
difference to spelling in the
16th and 17th centuries. Uni-
form spelling began with Cax-
ton's introduction of printing
to England and, according to
Webster, was almost achieved
by 1650. In support of this
view is the fact that Tyndale,
in his version of the Lord's
Prayer (1526) spelt over 70 per
cent, of the words as we do.—
K.A.L. (N.S.W.).
Eyes, Ears and Poetry
I agree with Douglas Stewart
that an “image is something
one sees” (B. 6/4/’6O), and
question “8.E.D.” (B. 27/4/’6O)
for questioning that reviewer
for wondering what “aural
imagery” means.
In my opinion there’s no
such thing. An image created
from something heard may be
formed only by aid of one or
all of the other senses —never
by the sense of hearing alone.
In short, you may become
stone-deaf yet remain highly
imaginative. Lose any of the
senses of sight, touch, smell, or
speech, however, and your
mind’s eye becomes impaired
to the full extent of your
physical loss.

Events are moving so rapidly these days that
it is well sometimes to pause and reflect how fast
the currents of modern life are running.
Let us look at the past fifteen years. Take
1945 as aLase. How close in memory it seems —•
and yet, in circumstance, how different from now!
We were then approaching the victorious end
of a war; had not begun to accommodate ourselves
to the problems it left behind.
Atomic power was a theory for the testing
in guarded laboratories. Uranium and other
radio-active ores had less value than clay.
All aircraft had propelled - engines, and
faster-than-sound flight by jet propulsion—if it
was mentioned at all—was dismissed as a dream.
To have foretold then that before 1960 the
Earth would have been circled by man-made
satellites, a rocket would have been sent to the
Moon, and astronauts would be training to travel
in outer space, would have been an invitation to
scorn. Yet those things have come to pass.
It has not been a march, it has been a racing,
this procession of events in the post-war years. And
the achievements I have mentioned are only some
of the larger signs of what men are attempting
and recording in our time. In less dramatic but
equally important fields, these years have been
productive of other remarkable advances for
human good.
My purpose in recalling this is to emphasise
that we are in an age which, even by the standards
of centuries to come, will be marked as one of the
most extraordinarily fulfilling in human history.
And here is my point: This still flashing period
embraces the very years when Australia is coming
up to a quick maturity. Time and the fruits of
human attainment combine to give us an
incomparable opportunity in developing a country
of such rich resource.
Should we need any perspective thought to
fortify our faith in Australia’s future, this is it.
fact, be a false and meaning-
less term.—P.O.M.C. (N.S.W.).
Poetic images can be classi-
fied according to the sense to
which they are directed (sight,
hearing, smell, taste, touch,
etc.). Those are, in fact, the
five senses comprised in the
adjective “sensuous.” There
are also kinaesthetic images,
which evoke images of move-
ment. All, of course, are visual,
in the sense that they are
evoked principally by sight in
the act of reading poetry
silently; or primarily aural if
the poetry be sounded by read-
ing aloud. You have practic-
ally the whole box of imagery
tricks in Rupert Brooke’s “The
Old Vicarage, Grantchester.”

Darwin Chinese
First award of the University
of N.S.W.’s newest degree,
Master of Technology, went to
a student of pure Chinese
blood, P. G. Pak Poy, a 27-
year-old traffic-engineer who
had previously obtained a
Bachelor of Engineering at
Adelaide University and is now
an assistant to the S.A. High-
ways Department's traffic-en-
gineer. A brother, Dr. R. K.
Pak Poy is a brilliant research-
pathologist, just returned after
a year’s study in England.
Incidentally, many descen-
dants of Chinese who came to
the Northern Territory in the
’eighties are proving valuable
citizens. They are “dinkum
Australians” in every sense of
the term. The contribution
they are making to our national
life makes one wonder whether
it would not be enriched if we
permitted a few more to enter
and settle—D.C.T. (N.S.W.).
Parents or State?
Statements made by Vic-
toria’s Chief Secretary in in-
troducing the bill to set-up a
new State Department of Social
Welfare indicate an earnest
attempt to solve the widespread
problem of juvenile
as well as to effect needed
reforms in social welfare.
The proposed department is
to have three sub-branches,
dealing respectively with family
welfare, youth welfare, and
Hamilton Hume
I strongly disagree with the
picture of Hamilton Hume
painted by Frank O’Grady
both in his novel No Boundary
Fence and in B. 13*/4/’6O.
In 1946 I typed-out every
reference to Hume at the Mit-
chell Library, obtaining photo-
stats of those that were too
lengthy; I also copied every
reference to him in the Yass
“Courier” from 1858 to 1873 ;
later I acquired a complete set
of Historical Records of Aus-
tralia. So my knowledge is
more-or-less first-hand.
O’Grady alleges that the
“Plain Statement of Facts” was
written when Hume was old
and senile. He is wrong on
both counts. The “Plain
Statement” was written in
1855, when the author was 58
and in full possession of all
his faculties. A later edition,
edited by J. J. Brown, was
published in 1873.
On May 2, 1873, the “S.M.
Herald,” in a- sub-leader on
Hume, dealt with a corres-
pondent’s claim that its
obituary had been tainted with
partiality. This leader strongly
supported Hume in his argu-
ment with Hovell, concluding:
“We believe that the one we
adopted [i.e., the “Herald’s”
view] must be that one which
the future historian will follow
on every known principle of
criticism [“Herald’s” italics].”
Another fact which dis-
counts O’Grady’s claim that
Hume was badly educated and
somewhat uncouth is that he
won the affections of a lady
of gentle birth, Elizabeth Dight
—this in a period when social
distinctions were pretty
marked. One can hardly
imagine her family approving
of the match (as they did) if
Hume had been illiterate and
uncouth.
All Hume’s letters point to
a standard of education at
least as high as that of the
average Government official
of his day. They are well
written and quite grammatical;
if his mother were his only
tutor, she taught him well.
Nor can I agree with
O’Grady’s comments on Henry
O’Brien. Knowing a little
about Henry I can’t imagine
him crawling up and stabbing
a man in the dark, even if
the victim were a bushranger.
Shoot him in fair fight, yes,
but not the knife in the dark.
That weapon was used by
Irish kerns, not by men of
O’Brien's birth and breeding.
I realise that O’Grady has
written a novel, and not a
serious work of history or
biography ; but one can write
a novel, and take some licence
with historical fact, without
distorting the picture of the
principal character.

prisons, each under its own
director; there is also pro-
vision for “divisions of re-
search and statistics, training,
probation and parole.”
There’s no question of the
need to widen the State’s
powers in regard to neglected
and delinquent children and
youths. During the past four
years an increasing number of
children have been committed
to the care of the Child Wel-
fare Department, either for
delinquency or because they
were in need of care and pro-
tection, the Chief Secretary
said.
Reasons were, he added, that
the child population was in-
creasing; more cases of child-
ren inadequately looked-after
by parents were being brought
to the attention of the depart-
ment or the courts; and—as in
most English-speaking com-
munities —there had been an
increase in juvenile delinquency.
The youth-welfare division,
it is proposed, will be respon-
sible for the treatment of all
delinquent youths; children’s
courts will be empowered to
commit persons between the
ages of 14 and 17 to youth-
training centres, and other
courts will be enabled to com-
mit older offenders (up to 21)
to youth-training centres, if
“the nature of the offence and
character of the offenders made
it appropriate.”
State youth-training centres
to cure juvenile delinquents?
I suppose the State must try
“What are you using for bait?"
something; children and youths
who come before the courts,
whether for reasons of parental
neglect, vandalism or crime, are
a problem for the State. But
can anyone really believe that
compulsory attendance at a
youth-training centre for games,
group-activities and hobbies,
with personal guidance thrown
in, will set right what has been
caused by years of bad ex-
ample or neglect in the home?
The prevalence of divorce,
the couldn’t-care-less attitude
of many parents towards their
children, the increasing tend-
ency of husband and wife to
put material possessions above
a balanced home-life, the
squandering of income on
liquor, gambling and luxuries
—-all these are contributing
towards the making of juvenile
delinquents (i.e., potential
criminals) out of boys and girls
who with proper home environ-
ment and example would be-
come good citizens.
In stating that “an important
part of the department’s work
would be keeping the family
together and preventing child-
ren from becoming wards of
the State,” the Chief Secretary
seems to have recognised that,
fundamentally, delinquency-
prevention is a job for parents,
not for the State. And he
added that “this would be
effected by financial assistance,
guidance and education of
parents in their obligations.”
It seems that sooner or
later the community must come
to grips with this grave social
problem. Not only the State
but all who lead and influence
public opinion and private con-
duct —churches, schools, busi-
ness, newspapers, radio and
television —will have to do
their utmost to awaken our
consciences. The alternative is
painfully obv i o u s. —D.J.G.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY IM SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
NATURE v. NURTURE
By W. G. WHITTLESTONE
Qome years ago Dr. John
Hancock carried - out a
most interesting experiment
using identical-twin cows. He
was trying to answer a ques-
tion debated for hundreds of
years: Which is more import-
ant, the inheritance of the
animal or the environment it
has to live in? Put bluntly:
Breeding or feeding?
I have told in earlier articles
why identical twins are so
important for scientific work:
One pair of twins comes from
a single egg, so they have
identical genetic make-ups.
This means that any differ-
ences are due to environment
and makes them ideal experi-
mental material.
Hancock planned his experi-
ment to include three types of
environment: one, average for
New Zealand ; the second
above average; and the third
below. This was done by
dividing a 26-acre block into
14 even paddocks, which were
then subdivided in the ratio
Addressing the Graziers’
Federal Council, an
Australian Meat Board
representative said that
Japanese orders lor
Australian mutton in
carcase form has risen
from five tons last year
to 1000 tons this year.

greatly reduce the risk
of fly-borne infection.
10:10:6. The above-average
treatment involved one of the
“10” paddocks plus silage and
hay ad lib. and concentrate
at the rate of lib. to every
51b. of milk given. The average
cows had a “10” paddock with
silage and hay ad lib., but no
concentrate. The below-
average cows had a “6” pad-
dock, which meant that they
got only 60 per cent, of the
pasture given to the others.
They had silage and hay at
the rate of 60 per cent, of that
eaten by the average-group.
The treatments were more-
or-less parallel to the sort of
thing you would find in prac-
tice. The above-average group
had the environment of
pedigree-cattle farms, where
the farmer was out for maxi-
mum production in order to
make his pedigree stock look
pretty good. The average-
group was treated as well as a
good New Zealand farmer
would treat his cows—really
above average. The worst
group represented an over-
stocked farm.
The experiment ran for
three years, so that the animals
had on the average a fairly
typical climatic environment.
They were rotationally grazed
to follow standard New
Zealand practice. Fifteen sets
of twins were used and these
were split as follows: Five
sets between above-average (A)
treatment and average (B)
treatment; five sets between
B and below - average (C)
treatment; five sets between
A and C.
Daily milk-samples were
taken and fat and casein
determined ; daily milk-weights
were recorded.
In a short article it is diffi-
cult to give all the details of
this important experiment, so
I will deal only with the high-
lights.
The first surprise was that
the cows on the A-treatment
averaged 4211 b. butterfat (aver-
age maturity-equivalent) as
against the New Zealand
average of 3001 b. Now, the
twins were just an ordinary
collection of average cows ;
quite representative of the
typical New Zealand herd. In
other words, better feeding
brought a collection of
ordinary cows up into the class
of over 4001 b. of fat a year.
It is easiest to think of the
results in percentages so I
have set the following figures
out to show some of the most
important effects:
Milk-yields
The B-group produced 84.1 per
cent, of the milk produced by the
A-group. The additional concen-
trate increased production of milk
by just on 16 per cent. Over-
stocking (C-treatment) reduced
milk-production by 9 per cent. It
the overstocked cows had been
given the best (A) treatment they
would have increased their milk-
production by 25.8 per cent. These
results suggest that in good New
Zealand pasture-conditions the
average cow is not able to produce
up to its potential capacity. Further-
more, overstocking or underfeed-
ing will reduce the production of
a cow despite its inherited ability
to produce well.
Butterfat
The B-group produced 82.5 per
cent of the fat produced by the
A-group cows, while the C-group
produced only 70.9 per cent. The
C-group cows produced 89.9 per
cent, of the fat given by the B-group.
In other words, fat-production, like
milk-production, is a matter of
feeding. B'utterfat-percentage, on
the other hand, was not greatly
affected by the treatments. There
was only 0.11 per cent, difference
between the A’s and the B's and
the B's and C’s, while the A’s
and C’s showed only 0.21 per
cent. Calculated as percentages
of the percentage of fat these
differences are: between B's and
A’s, 1.8 per cent.; between C’s
and B's, 1.8 per cent.; between
C’s and A’s, 4.5 per cent. Thus,
within the range of this experi-
ment, environmental differences did
not have much of an effect on the
quality of the milk measured- by
fat-content.
Casein
In these days, when everyone
is talking about “total solids’’ or
“solids, not fat, in milk,” it is
interesting to look at Hancock’s
figures for the effects of environ-
ment on casein in milk. The
B-group produced 82 per cent, of
the casein produced by the A-
group, while the C's produced even
less—7o.6 per cent. The C’s pro-
duced per cent, of the casein
produced by the B's.
Evidently the nutritional level
had a marked effect on total casein-
production of these cows. The
differences in casein percentages
are, however, quite small. A-B
differences were 0.07 per cent., or,
as percentages of percentages, 2.8
per cent.; B-C differences were
0.03 per cent., or, as percentages
of percentages, 1.2 per cent.; A-C
differences were 0.10 per cent., or,
as percentages of percentages, 4.3
per cent.
Looking at the effects of the
three different environments on
milk-quality expressed as fat-
and casein-content, it is appar-
ent that concentrate-feeding or
overstocking of average cows
in New Zealand pasture-
farming conditions had a very
small effect on milk-quality.
There was a most fascinating
case of inheritance affecting
very strongly the production of
a cow. One pair of twins in
the experiment had “under-
shot” jaws. This defect made
it hard for them to graze on
short pasture, because their
teeth were, so to say, too far
away from their noses, and
they couldn’t get a bite at the
REPORT' FROM CROHAMHURST
(28/ 4/’60)
South-east Queensland should have reasonably good
rains during May. Falls should be moderate in part of the
central highlands and the Maranoa, though poor elsewhere
in the State. The eastern half of Queensland should have
heavy rains in June, with flooding on the coast south of
Mackay. Except during August, rainfall is then likely to
be poor until November.
N.S.W. should have general rains during May, with
heaviest falls on the Central and South Coasts, on the
Southern Tablelands and part of the South-west Slopes and
in the central western districts. Serious flooding is likely
in the eastern half of the State. The rains should continue
in June, with further flooding in the central and southern
divisions.
Victoria should also have general rains in May, with
heaviest falls in west-coast districts and in East Gippsland.
Rainfall looks like being patchy in June, although reasonably
good rains are indicated for July.
The agricultural areas and west coastal districts of
South Australia should have good rains during May, but
rainfall may be poor elsewhere. Moderate patchy rains are
likely in June, with general rains during July.
The agricultural areas of Western Australia should
have moderate rains during May, with good falls about the
Fortescue and West Gascoyne. Rainfall is likely to be
moderate around Eucla and in the north-east, but may be
poor elsewhere.

short grass. It so happened
that this pair of twins was split
between A and C. The twin
on the good grass and con-
centrate did quite well, but
her unfortunate sister packed-
up early in the season on the
short pastures of treatment-C,
because she could not get
enough to eat. This is a spec-
tacular illustration of the way
environment and inheritance
can act on one another.
Another point of interest is
the ranking-order of the twins
for yields and fat-percentages.
The ranking-order was high
even between A’s and C's for
total production, while for
percentages of fat and casein
it was very high indeed. What
this means is that compara-
tively good cows remain com-
paratively good even in a
tough environment, while if
conditions are extra good the
better cows will still remain
better than their fellows in the
same environment.
The most practical points
which emerge from this study
are the great accuracy of twins
for this kind of work and a
clear demonstration of the
importance of environment
over inheritance. High-
producing cows on a pedigree-
farm where they get the A-
grade treatment will probably
only give a C-grade response
in a C-grade environment.
The differences in production’
between commercial herds are
most likely to be connected
with the management of the
farm, and not with the genetic
make-up of herds involved.
Bonnier, the great Swedish
dairy - authority, puts the
genetic effect at about 7 per
cent, of the variations between
herds —the remaining 93 per
cent, being due to environ-
ment.
Obviously immediate im-
provement in production will
not come from paying fancy
prices for handsome bulls, but
for improving the management,
so that cows are fed and
milked more effectively.
Keyline Comment
P. A. Yeomans’s “Keyline
Comment” No. 3, just pub-
lished, contains an excellent
account by Professor J. Mac-
donald Holmes of an address
he gave at the 121st Annual
Conference of the British As-
sociation of Science at York
last September. He was at-
tending the conference in his
official capacity as Professor of
Geography at Sydney Univer-
sity and mentioned Yeomans’s
The Challenge of Landscape in
the course of his address:
The members began to take an
interest at that late hour of the
day and realised [that] here was
something new, seemingly sound in
principle, simple in execution,
economic in application, negligible
in financial commitments; and
obviously likely to yield a profit.
There were some questions. The
Key line idea was well 'received.
S.r Dudley Stamp, one of
the most distinguished scien-
tists present and Chief Adviser
in Rural Land-use to the British
Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries, 1943-55, held the
book aloft, says Professor Mac-
donald Holmes- "and com-
plained that I had been too
modest in my assessment of it.”
In an article entitled “Con-
servation or Development?”
P. A. Yeomans puts clearly and
irrefutably his side of the con-
troversy raised by a remark
made in the course of a lecture
by E. R. Smith, Principal
Engineer, N.S.W. Water and
Irrigation Commission, and
published in “Wool Technology
and Sheepbreeding,” mid-year
issue 1959, to the effect that the
Keyline Plan “does not appear
to be either economic or
efficient in the use of water.”
He also answers another com-
ment, which may or may not
apply to Keyline, made by E.
S. Clayton, N.S.W. Soil Con-
servation Commissioner, by
giving his own ideas about the
philosophy and practice of soil-
conservation. As part of a dis-
cusson between adherents of
orthodox and progressive
theories, this article is im-
portant and should be read by
all interested in Australian
land-development.
Road-transport
“K. Mac”: In a comparative
table “1.H.G.” (B. 20/4/’6O)
showed road-transport as being
more costly than either rail- or
air-transport for goods and
cattle. If his figures showing
loss (or subsidy required) were
correct, then'the sky would be
full of planes, while our cars
and trains would be going to
Japan as scrap-iron.
He erred, however, in charg-
ing road-hauliers with the
whole cost of interest and
maintenance for sealing exist-
ing roads and constructing new
roads over a total length of
1257 miles, when such vehicles
would comprise only about 20
per cent, of the road-traffic.
In my opinion automotive
engineers both here and abroad
have concentrated too much on
designing vehicles suitable for
the big trade in densely settled
areas. Consequently large
transport-vehicles suitable for
areas like the Northern Terri-
tory have been neglected. The
cattle road-trains of 30-head
capacity, which “1.H.G.” uses
in his calculations, are far too
small. Ten trips to carry a
mere 300 head is ridiculous,
Imagine a station situated 600
miles from a~ meatworks or
seaboard and turning-off 6000
cattle a year. A round-trip
would mean 1200 miles, and
200 road-train trips would be
needed to lift all the cattle—a
total of 240,000 miles a year,
With such tinpot vehicles road-
transport could never be
economic,
We should do something to
set automotive-engineers think-
iiig. If Canberra offered, say,
a £30,000 reward for the design
of a road-train with capacity
for at least 130 bullocks,
engineers might concentrate
their inventive attention on the
subject.
Why can’t road-trains be
made considerably wider than
at present and given the right-
of-way along the crown of the


highways? Why can’t each
prime mover be made to pull
six trucks instead of three?
Engineers could probably give
a score of reasons why such
things cannot be done, but let
them bear in mind the con-
siderably greater problems
scientists had to overcome
before they got satellites into
space.
A carrying-capacity of 130
bullocks would need 46.15
trips to shift 6000 head, and the
mileage would be reduced to
54,380 per year. That would
be a big improvement, and
would whet our ambitions for
something better. No doubt
those responsible foj: defence-
measures would be keenly in-
terested in the success of large-
capacity road-trains.
Hoof-care
“Dinny”: A healthy horse
turned-out on good grass in
a well-watered paddock can
be ruined through deformity
of the feet. Inattention to
hoofs can cause this, and may
also cause lameness and pos-
sible infections of the legs, if
bacteria enter through cracked
hoof-walls.
Well-shod horses are not
immune, either, because
growth is not restricted by
shoes. These become loosened
when hoofs grow beyond
them, and then, if torn-off,
they are likely to take the
edges of the hoof.with them.
Unless hoofs are rasped
down neatly there's likely ttx
be chipping and splitting, which
may mean long treatment to
bring them back to a condition
that will allow shoeing.
Overgrown hoofs can cause
accidents when horses- are
galloping in the paddock for
exercise, because they make
the animals less surefooted.
Hoofs grow quickly and
sometimes reach a stage that
needs attention in a few
weeks.
Irrigating
Riverina Soils
“H.A.L.: ” People travelling
through the Riverina often
wonder why the landowners do
not establish irrigated pastures.
There is plenty of water and the
land is level, making flood-
irrigation merely a matter of
throwing up check-banks.
But those who live there
have the answer. When irri-
gated, the grey and brown
alkaline soils form a surface-
crust, which prevents water
from penetrating. The scien-
tific explanation is that the clay
contains sodium, which causes
it to form very fine particles
These swell when wet, and the
clay then becomes watertight.
Tests had shown that gyp-
sum, at the rate of 2} tons -an
acre, would cure the trouble,
but this would cost £lO an
acre, making it hopelessly un-
economic. The C.5.1.R.0. Divi-
sion of Soils, however, has now
made one of those “break-
through” discoveries whose
eventual results, like that of
correcting trace-element defici-
ency, have no foreseeable limit.
Dr. J. P. Quirk, of the
C.5.1.R.0., working in collabo-
ration with Dr. R. K. Schofield
at Rothamsted (Eng.), carried-
out the basic research on these
alkaline clays, then sought an
inexpensive means of making
them permeable to water.
The best way to do this was
to make the clay flocculate —-
that is, make the particles
gather into large aggregates in-
stead of small ones. Experi-
ments showed that this could
be done by adding a small
amount of electrolyte (soluble
salts) to the irrigation-water,
instead of topdressing with big
quantities of the same material.
J. L. Davidson collaborated
with Dr. Quirk in field-trials
on Falkiner Memorial Field
Station, and it was found that
scwt. gypsum was sufficient for
a quantity of water that would
flood an acre of ground to a
depth of 3in.
Finely ground, the gypsum
will dissolve, and when the
water it’s in is used for irriga-
tion the clay flocculates into a
coarse aggregate, the water
penetrates, and good stands of
pasture can be established and
maintained.
If the experience of Hum-
phrey Kempe, of Lindsay
Point Station, downstream from
Wentworth, is a guide, then
once legumes have been estab-
lished the character of the soil
will soon change to a loose,
rich loam, as its nitrogen-level
is raised.
Kempe found that no agri-
cultural implement yet devised
could break-up the cement-
hard subsoil on his bluebush-
flats. The best that could be
done was to scarify the surface
sufficiently to allow Japanese-
millet to be grown as an initial
crop, and eventually the fine
roots accomplished what no
implement could do. They
penetrated the hard-pan, and
when they decayed they left
minute holes down which irri-
gation-water could permeate,
to moisten the subsoil and allow,
clover to grow. By fixing
nitrogen in the soil, these
clovers then turned clay to
loam.
Riverina experiments indi-
cate that gypsum dissolved in
the water for the first irriga-
tion will bring about a similar
transformation in the almost
equally heavy clays there, in
due course the Snowy Scheme
will be sending a great deal of
additional water for irrigation
down the Murray and Murrum-
bidgee, and, thanks to this
C.5.1.R.0. break-through, some
of this extra water can be used
to start many thousands of
acres of Riverina land on the
way to becoming as productive
as the irrigated areas on Hum-
phrey Kempe’s property—and
visitors declare that these are
as lush as anything in Holland
or Denmark.
Panama-disease
“Wilga’': Queensland's fruit-
marketing committee-of-direc-
tion is looking for a new type
of hardy banana, tough-
skinned, not “rubbery” and
easily grown in existing con-
ditions.
During hot, humid weather
existing varieties ripen too
quickly, and an estimated 50
per cent, of the bananas deli-
vered to market-agents have to
be dumped, because they will
not “hold” in a satisfactory
condition until they reached the
consumer.
The most popular variety,
Cavendish, introduced from
China and Samoa over 100
years ago, is so sensitive to
handling that marks and bruis-
ing are almost a distinguishing
characteristic. Lady-finger (also
a general favorite, and the only
variety that may be grown in
the Greater Brisbane area be-
cause of its resistance to
bunchy-top) ripens very quickly
when mature. It is, however,

covered—in particular when

OUTSTANDING
HADDON RIG TEAM
TO FACE BIDDERS AT
1960
SYDNEY RAM SALES
98 Haddon Rig rams—s Special Stud Rams,
45 Stud Rams and 48 Selected Rams—were
chosen on 20th April to represent Australia’s
premier Merino Stud at the Sydney Ram
Sales in June. The Stud is more than satis-
fied with the quality of the team, and is
quietly confident that buyers will share its
high opinion of the rams.
The five Haddon Rig “Specials,” together
with 25 Studs and 28 Selecteds, will be
offered by Goldsbrough Mort & Company.
20 Stud Rams will be offered by Dalgety &
Company, and 20 Selected Rams by Elder
Smith & Company. Before they go under
the hammer some of these rams will com-
pete in the Macarthur Sheep Show.
Last year’s Haddon Rig team set a very
high barrier for its successor. Haddon Rig
sold the top sire (£3885), secured the “best-
ever” average for Studs (£693) and took top
aggregate for the 20th consecutive year.
However, there are strong indications that
1960 will be another “bumper” year for
Haddon Rig; 2875 ewes realised 25,515
guineas at the first auction sale ever held
on the property. March deliveries of Flock
and Selected Rams reached 3124 —the
highest in the Stud’s 78 years. Before you
make a bid at the Sydney Sales remember
that over 200 Studs and many more flocks
are already profiting by Haddon Rig Blood.

subject to Panama-disease.
Gros Michel, a first-class fruit,
excellent for growing in the
tropics, is also affected by the
disease.
The presence of Panama-
disease is shown when the
margins of lower leaves turn
deep-yellow and later go brown
and dry-out, while the stalk
collapses and the leaves hang
round the stem. The interior
of the corm becomes discolored
by numerous brown or black
lines running through the white
tissue.
The trouble is caused by. a
fungus of the Fusariun family
able to survive in the soil for a
long time. It will spread to the
suckers through the tissues
connecting a diseased plant.
There’s no chemical control
for the disease, so precautions
must be taken. Get suckers of
all susceptible varieties from a
district free from the disease,
and plant them in new ground,
where the trouble has never
occurred. The disease can be
carried by infested soil on
boots or farm-implements or
from diseased portions of
plants. All infested stools
should be dug out completely,
cut into small pieces and burnt
on the spot. All implements
used in cutting must be steri-
lised in a formalin-solution or
passed through a flame before
using again.
Paperwork
“Kune”: Latest commodity
threatening the dairy - cow's
menu is newsprint. “McLean’s,”
the Canadian national maga-
zine, reports that British
Columbian Professor of Hus-
bandry A. J. Wood is ex-
perimenting successfully with
paper-pellets, to which other
nutrients are added, as cow-
fodder; because paper has, says
the journal, as high a propor-
tion of cellulose (basis of vege-
table tissues), as hay. Goats,
of course, have known the
fodder-value of paper for cen-
turies!
Humpyback-disease
“Mulga”: Humpyback
affects sheep which eat the
quena-nightshade (commonly
known as wild-potato), a small
perennial plant between 9in.
and 12in. high, which dies
back in winter but shoots
afresh from the roots with the
first spring-rains. This plant
bears purple or blue flowers
and a small fruit, about the
size of a cherry, which turns
yellow when ripe.
Humpyback usually appears
in the summer, but can occur
whenever the plant is preva-
lent. Sheep affected by the
disease stand with their backs
humped, and tremble violently
in their limbs. The condition
generally appears when the
sheep are driven in hot
weather. It’s a problem if it
comes on during the shearing-
season, when flocks have to be
mustered. If affected sheep are
driven they usually collapse
and die, but if allowed to rest
they generally recover very
quickly. As the trouble is
made worse by heat, shearing
will help towards recovery.
General practice is to allow
affected animals to drop out
of the muster and bring them
by truck to the shearing-shed
after they have rested. When
shorn they then have every
chance of recovery.
Farm Hints
“Andy”: Out of sight, out
of mind —that’s sometimes the
fate of isolated windmills. A
few hours spent in tightening
boits and nuts, and oiling where
necessary, could prevent the
risk of waterless stock in the
back-paddock after a violent
storm.
“Univa”: Drums of fuel
lying in the open should be
tilted to prevent rainwater
entering through the bung.
No matter how tightly the
bung is secured water will
otherwise find its way in,
owing to contraction or expan-
sion caused by weather.
“A.C.T.”: Spark - arresters
for tractors are being tried-
out at the Australian tractor-
testing station at Werribee
(Vic.) with the aim of prevent-
ing bushfire outbreaks. The
Victorian Country Roads
Board is leading the way by
insisting that engines of all
new plant muct be fitted with
arresters tested at the station.
Lessening of tractor-noise and
the testing of devices claimed
to prevent tractors rolling over
or tipping up are other matters
being looked into.
“J.J.A.”: When foxes raid
lambs by climbing netting
fences, find the posts they climb
and set a rabbit-trap on the
top, with the edge of the tongue
opposite where scratches come
up the post. Tie the chain
securely to the wire, and be

From G. Masters (W.A.): Dill-
seed is certainly essential if
cucumbers are to be pickled by
the brine-dill method (B. 23/3/’6O),
otherwise they are just ordinary
pickled cucumbers—a great differ-
ence. Dill-seed is obtainable from
seedsmen. In Perth’s outer suburbs
it grows wild.
Information Sought
Information on John Mackay
and his discovery of the Pioneer
River; also, if he married and had
descendants.
John Mackay was born at Inver-
ness (Scotland) in 1839, migrating
to Australia in 1854. In 1860 he
left Armidale (N.S.W.) with a party
at the request of (Sir) Arthur
Palmer to find suitable pastoral
country, his route being across the
Darling Downs to Gayndah and
Rockhampton and thence to the
“I’m just experimenting, dear.”
Burdekin River. Turning east to
the coast his party discovered a
river which they named the Mackay,
but later renamed the Pioneer.
Followed an unsuccessful
attempt to establish a station called
Green Mount near the river the
following year; then the cutter
Presto arrived at the river-mouth
with stores, and the survey they made
was sent to the Crown Lands Office
in Brisbane, after which the mouth
of the Pioneer River was declared
the point of entry and given
Mackay’s name. After spending
the next 20 years or so at sea
Mackay was appointed Harbor-
master at Cooktown, a post he held
for six years. In 1901 he was
appointed Portmaster and chair-
man of the Marine Board in Bris-
bane, a position he held till his
death there in 1914. The Austra-
lian Encyclopaedia, which details
the above, makes no mention of
his marriage.

What is syndicalism ?
It is the doctrine of government,
a development of trade-unionism
(Fr. Syndicat, trade-union), its aim
being the abolition of Parliamentary
government and capitalism and the
substitution of trade-unionism as
the controller and owner of each
particular industry. It rejects the
Socialist view regarding the collec-
tive ownership of industries and of
the means of distribution of their
products.

“I'll let you into a secret — I'm going back this Way!”
New Recordings
Two Great Voices
One of the finest singing-
records made since the advent
of LP is that issued by Decca
on 12in., Operatic Arias, Joan
Sutherland (LXTA 5531).
Those who heard the Sydney
soprano when she won the
“Sun” aria and Mobil Quest
competitions 10 years ago will
scarcely be prepared for the
magnificence, not only of her
voice, but of her art. On this
pressing, which ranges over 40
minutes of some of the most
difficult aspects of coloratura
singing, hers must be rated as
one of the great voices of the
century. Effortlessly produced,
and of superb timbre, it has
amazing agility, and her control
of tone in every register is of
facile mastery.
The performance that
had almost every critic in
England and Europe at her
feet was “Lucia di Lammer-
moor,” and two arias from the
opera are included here, the
“Regnava nel Silenzio” and the
celebrated “Mad Scene.” It is
this latter exposition of alter-
nating serene and dramatic
singing, capped by an outburst
of vocal dimentia to make your
ears flap which constitutes the
highlight of splendid song-
making. Other arias (which,
though off the beaten track,
are replete with engaging
melody) comprise one from
“Linda di Chamounix” (also
by Donizetti), and one each
from “Ernani” and “Sicilian
Vespers,” both by Verdi. She
.is ably supported by the Paris
Conservatorium Orchestra
under Nello Santi.
The other singer is the
Mexican mezzo-soprano Oralia
Dominguez. Hers is a voice
not only of great quality but
of a really remarkable range,
used here well over three
octaves, with never the faintest
sign of straining after effect.
And, for a voice of such depth
and weight, it is astonishingly
flexible.
Like Joan, Oralia gets away
from the hackneyed in her
choice of aria. There are
florid but acceptable excerpts
from Donizetti's little-known
“La Favorita” and two from
almost - forgotten Rossini
operas, “Italian Girl in
Algiers” and “La Cenerentola.”
There are noble songs from
Verdi’s “Don Carlos’’ and
Cilea’s “Adriana Lecouvreur ”
Concessions to the more popu-
lar taste are the “Habanera”
and the “Seguidilla” from
“Carmen” and that delight and
despair of the fiigh-voice-
throwers, the “Una Voce” from
“The Barber of Seville.” In
all these the beauty of voice
is a perfect match for that of
her features reproduced on the
record’s sleeve. A 12in., it is
from Philips on Deutch Gram-
mophon (LPEM 19 179). The
Bavarian State Opera Orchestra
collaborates.
An interesting release from
Coronet is Delius’s Hassan
(KLC 2691), written as inci-
dental music to Flecker’s play.
Like his “Sea Drift,” which
also employs chorus and solo
voices and instruments, this
work is strongly evocative of
scenes and characters, and it is
fitting that Beecham, the man
who first made Delius’s music
known, should conduct the
Royal Philharmonic Orchestra
and the 8.8. C. Chorus. The
reverse side has the same com-
poser’s orchestral suite, “Over
the Hills and Far Away.”
Johann Strauss’s operetta
A Night In Venice is a
pleasant little 7in. E.P. from
Philips (402 103 NE) which
has several competent soloists,
backed by the Vienna Sym-
phony Orchestra, in excerpts
from this work, which is in
the usual vein of light Strauss
melody-and-waltz confection.
From Coronet is another
7in., Oscar Levant (KEP 190),
in which the pianist puts his
nimble digits over De-
Falla’s “Ritual Fire-Dance”
and Debussy’s “Golliwog’s
Cake-Walk,” the more leisurely
“Malaguena” and the dreamy
“Clair de Lune” of Debussy.

Three for Dancers
Dance - band leaders from
three countries contribute to
this tuneful collection of
rhythm and melody. Fiesta
(PI 4001 R), a 10-in. disk
from Philips, is a programme
of Latin American dances —
rumbas, mambos, merengues
and cha-cha-chas —played with
the zing and abandon such
numbers demand. But the man
who gives the beat is neither a
gaucho nor a caballero, but a
Belgian, Francis Bay, who also
slides a wicked trombone
among the brasses. Several
older numbers “Andalucia,”
“Tico-tico” and “Rumba negra”
are shuffled in among the newer
pieces; all are presented with
exuberance and enthusiasm.
Frenchman Franck Pourcel
and his orchestra are respon-
sible for Dance to the Violins
(H.M.V.—OELP 5030), a col-
lection which also includes a
strong Latin American bracket
—three boleros, two tangos
and a mambo —but is balanced
with Parisian slow-foxtrots and
waltzes. For good measure
there’s the quickstep “Nick
Nack Paddywhack,” which may
seem rather out of place on a
bill-of-fare otherwise French
and Spanish, but which really
fits-in just as neatly as it did
into “The Inn of the Sixth
Happiness.” For 10 years
Pourcel’s string-orchestra haa
been one of the best known in
Europe.
In contrast to Pourcel’s violin
and Bay’s trombone, Coronet’s
contribution to the dance-trio,
Romantic Waltzes (KLPB4B),
is presented on the Hammond
organ, with Ken Griffin at the
keyboard. A round dozen of
evocative tunes with evocative
names, among them “Waltz of
the Roses,” “Masquerade,”
“Drifting Back to Dreamland”
and “Melody of Love.”


Women's Letters
SYDNEY
What a week it has been for excite-
ment! The Royal Wedding, of course,
was its peak. The most wonderful thing
of all was the fact that we in Sydney
could have a TV grandstand-view of
every part of the ceremony and proces-
sions without moving from our sitting-
rooms. This, less than two days after the
event!
Princess Margaret’s choice of wedding-
dress seemed absolutely inspired. All the
sparkle and sumptuousness and panoply
served as a foil for the beautiful sim-
plicity of her white silk-organza gown.
Her veil, bound with the organza, will
probably start a fashion, but it was quite
a departure not to have had a veil over
her face at any part of the ceremony.
An engaging glimpse of the bride was
caught by TV-viewers after the return
to Buckingham Palace. She was seen
“jumping up and down for joy” as
members of the Royal Family greeted
her. This skipping and jumping was quite
a feature of films we have seen of her
as a little girl. It was nice to think she
felt the same way on her wedding-day.
Another appealing touch was the choice
of bridesmaids’ dresses. Copies of her
own first evening-dress (which was said
to have been her father's favorite dress),
they paid a gentle tribute to his memory.
☆ ☆ ☆
The wedding was celebrated in Sydney
with a dinner-dance at the Royal Com-
monwealth Society, where guests saw
a preview of the film: “Princess Mar-
garet, This is Your Life,” which had been
specially flown out to the U.K. Office
of Information. Colonel and Mrs. Colvin
entertained a large party which included
Dr. and Mrs. Neville Morgan, Mr.
Laurence Hope (U.K. Trade Commis-
sioner) and Mrs. Hope, Mr. and Mrs.
R. W. G. Nagle, Colonel and Mrs. Nyman
and Miss Rowena Vining. In Mr. and
Mrs. Fred Daniell’s party were Mrs.
David Lindsay and Mr. and Mrs. W.
Broadfoot.

American members of the Sydney
community must have been what they
called “bushed” this week after all the
ceremonies and social functions that cele-
brated the Coral Sea victory. (“Bushed”
in American means “tired out,” not
“lost” as we interpret it.)
☆ ☆ ☆
A lighthouse winked a light in the
foyer of the Trocadero to set the motif
for the Coral Sea Ball, which was
attended by about 900 guests, all bright
and richly dressed. The guests-of-honor,
Admiral Herbert G. Hopwood, U.S.N.,
and Mrs. Hopwood and the Premier
and Mrs. Heffron, were greeted by Mrs.
lan Jacoby, wearing silver lame re-
embroidered with pearls and rhinestones,
and Mr. and Mrs. R. Keith Yorston.
Mrs. Orray Taft, wife of the American
Consul, set the American style in tur-
quoise poule de soir, and Mrs. Ken
McCabe (president of the American
Women’s Club) looked charming in blue
nylon hail-spotted with white.
One of Sydney’s promising players in
the repertory field is Robin Lawlor, who
has a part in the Ensemble Theatre’s
current production, “Orpheus Descend-
ing,” and will play also in their forth-
coming production, the gay comedy
“Lullaby,” by Don A pell. In this she will
play the mother, “a middle-aged, rather
domineering type." Robin has always
been cast for these older roles despite her
youthful appearance, and says she wel-
comes the experience. Her ambition is
eventually to make acting her full-time
career. Photo by Montgomery Dunn.
Crowds mobbed film-star Charlton
Heston in quite the approved fashion
at the gala-premiere of “Ben-Hur” on
Thursday night. The facade of St.
James Theatre, always gay, was particu-
larly so for the occasion, and on the
balcony of the Supreme Court opposite
girl-pipers—all lace and plaid and bonnets
and buckles —sounded their Scottish airs
in the glare of floodlights. The
Governor and Lady Woodward were
welcomed by Mrs. Bill White, whose
committee had organised the premiere
in aid of the Royal Institution for Deaf
and Blind Children. After the conclu-
sion of the film a champagne-supper
was held in the mezzanine-foyer of the
theatre.
On Wednesday night Monte Sant’
Angelo ex-students held their annual ball,
nine debutantes being presented to his
Grace Bishop Carroll (the girls were
voted “the prettiest of the season so
far”). Mrs. Roma O'Reilly, president
of the ex-students, received the guests,
and Miss Mary McCarron, wearing a
lovely model in tones of champagne and
brown, was matron-of-honor,

Then, of course, there were the Uni-
versity students and their pranks on
Commem. Day. It was a great pity that
just a few spoiled the general standard
of fun and amusement which gives the
city a light-hearted laugh at least once
a year. The students were dressed in the
funniest ways they could think of, but
their efforts were rather diminished by
the fact that the ordinary fashions to be
seen any day of the week in Sydney
streets are so carefree and zany. This
Letter approached two supposed students
for a copy of “Honi Soit” before getting
one from an Abominable Snowman. The
first two, in black and red stockings, were
just plain citizens, it seems.

The State president of the Penguin
Club of Australia, Mrs. A. B. Napper,
presided at the 12th annual State con-
vention held during the week, “the guests
included Mrs. Jean Ellis (co-founder and
Federal president of the Club, who was
greeted by Penguins from near and far
who quite filled the C.W.A. Auditorium
at Potts Point), Mrs. Gwen Morton
Spencer (another foundation-member),
and Mrs. Max Halliday.
The subject of the convention was
“Australia’s Place in the British Com-
monwealth of Nations,” and the four
members who demonstrated the value of
the club’s training in public-speaking
were Mrs. L. Schultz, Mrs. R. H. Ryan,
Mrs. Douglas Anderson and Mrs. John
Palmer, of Port Kembla. The latter, with
a group of South Coast Penguins, drove
home in the moonlight after the meeting.

A new note for layettes is the brushed-
wool tartan pram-cover in white, blue,
pink and yellow, which is the only
colored item in the all-white layette which
the Queen has accepted from the Hand-
Knitted Wool Council. The council’s
gift, which might be a good guide to
mothers who want to provide for their
baby like a prince, includes eight vests
(all crossover styles), three sleeping-bags,
eight pilchers, eight pairs of bootees,
three complete pram-sets, a number of
cardigans and jackets, a shawl, an unusual
Shetland-sweater knitted in traditional
stitches, three pairs of rompers and a
pram-cover. The patterns for nearly all
the designs have been put into leaflet
form, so it should not be long before
many mothers are knitting them up for
their own babes.


The death of Miss Una Clift at the
weekend took away a most distinguished
woman from our midst. She was a
wonderful organiser for the Australian
Ladies’ Golf Union and for the N.S.W.
LG.U., which during her 47 years of
presidency increased from 13 to 281 clubs
and which raised, under her guidance,
£40,000 for the Australian Comforts
Fund during World War 11.
But it is not alone for her public work
that Miss Clift will be remembered. Here
is an extract from Duke Tritton’s Time
Means Tucker, speaking of a time around
1905, when he and a mate sought work
at Breeza, the Clift homestead. It speaks
for itself:
“We spoke to a young lady whom we
found to be Miss Una Clift. She was
very pleasant and took us in to the
manager, but he said they seldom em-
ployed any casual labor. Then Miss
Clift took us to the homestead-kitchen
and asked the cook to fill our bags. When
this was done we went to the station-
store, where she issued the travellers’-
nations.”
MELBOURNE
Princess Margaret being president of
the Victoria League’s Young Contingent,
that body held a party to celebrate her
Royal Highness’s wedding. Air-Vice-
Marshal A. L. Walters proposed the toast
of the Princess and her consort at just
the time when the Princess,was due to
leave her mother’s home, Clarence
House, for Westminster Abbey. One of
the features of this pleasant party was
the icecream wedding - cake surmounted
with a crown, also in ice-cream. Mrs.
Waiters accompanied her husband, wear-
ing a mink coat and a high hat made of
swathings of black tulle. Another
honored guest was Senator Ivy Wedg-
wood, who was with her husband, Mr.
Jack Wedgwood. Senior vice-president
of the V.L., Mrs. Guy Bakewell, was
with her husband, and other vice-presi-
dents at the party were Mrs. Robert
Hamilton and Mrs. Frank May. Specially
invited for the occasion were young
officers from the U.S.S. Helena, and in-
cluded Lieuts. M. Hoppe and Bill Tilger,
and Ensign Steve Leggatt. Guests were
received by Y.C. president Max Chap-
man, and among members present were
Tatyana Firth, Pamela Middleton,
Denise Booth, Dianna Holyman,
Margaret Beck, Mary Carter, Eve
Fascon, and Diana Moore (from New

Displayed in the foyer of the Gros-
venor Theatre on the night of the gala-
premiere of the film “The Royal Ballet”
was one of the frocks worn by Dame
Margot Fonteyn during one of her
dances, and a pair of her ballet- shoes.
Every seat had been sold for this per-
formance, and proceeds were given to
the Royal Academy of Dancing (Aus-
tralian branch). As Lady Tait, president
of the organising-committee, is overseas,
her place was taken by Mrs. Allan Wynn,
who was accompanied by her husband,
Dr. Wynn.
In the audience were Sir Frank and
Lady Selleck, Mrs. Ken. Luke and her
small daughter Jennifer, Mrs. L. R.
Buxton (her full skirt of grey quilted-
silk was allied to a matching embroidered
evening-sweater), Mrs. John \ Teague,
Mrs. George Weir, Mr. and Mrs. Eric
Lampe, Sir Frank and Lady Richardson,
Mrs. G. R. Stevenson, Mrs. F. Shipton
and her daughter Sandra, Mrs. Lindsay
Plant and Mrs. T. G. Jones (smart in a
black frock and white mink stole).
Attractive programme-sellers were Ann
Curtis and Prue Elder. Committee-mem-
bers present were Mrs. Leo Curtis, Mrs.
lan Miller, Mrs. A. Abrahams, Mrs. Erl
Grey, Madame Le Bas de Plumetot, Mrs.
T. S. Carlyon and the Misses Eileen and
Jennie Brennan.
Although she has five children to care
for and a large house to run, Mrs. Curtis,
wife of city councillor Leo Curtis, still
finds time to devote to community pro-
jects. She is president of the 80 auxiliaries
attached to the Royal Women’s Hospital,
is on the Your Opportunity committee,
works for the Blind Babies Appeal and
is on the board of management of the
Try Boys Society. She is also a member
of the parents’ association of Loretto’s
Mandeville Hall. Mrs. Curtis was an
active member of the group which
organised the gala-night of the film “The
Royal Ballet,” which helped the funds of
the Royal Academy of Dancing. She
is chairman of the women’s functions
committee for World Refugee Year.

A most delightful party was that given
by Rear-Admiral F. J. Becton, com-
mander of the U.S.N. Cruiser Division 5,
in the wardroom of his flagship, U.S.S.
Helena. A matey air was struck imme-
diately by the officers, who gave hosting-
assistance to their chief by guiding guests
down steep companionways and along
the winding corridors, wearing name-
tabs. There were many exclamations of
wonder as guests viewed the beautiful
silverware stored in a huge glass cabinet,
and at the magnificent silver punch-bowl
from which a delectable fruit drink was
served. Earlier in the afternoon Rear-
Admiral Becton had called on the Lord
Mayor, Cr. Bernard Evans, who returned
the call by accompanying the Lady
Mayoress to the party. Highlight of the
party was the surprise singing of Helena’s
glee-club, formed by a small number of
the ship’s ratings, and among the items
was a perfect rendering of “Waltzing
Matilda.”
Sir John Latham, president of the
Australian - American Association, was
given the naval honor of being piped on
and off the ship. Also at the party were
Surgeon Rear-Admiral L. Lockwood,
R.A.N., and Mrs. Lockwood ; Commo-

whether sufficient of the most attract-

are placing their houses in their set-
tings ; or sometimes, as in other plates,
it is demonstrated that even if the
house itself is not essentially attractive,
at least the view from the picture-
windows is.
But too often —disconcertingly to a
reviewer very much in favor of the
more elegant contemporary styles—the
few photographs of colonial mansions,
contrasting with many of the modern
houses, simply convey the impression
that our ancestors lived in palaces
while we live in matchboxes . . . and
indeed there can be no doubt that the
future is going to find many of our
houses just as hideous as we find those
of the Victorians.
A final disadvantage that must be
mentioned is that there is no letter-
press whatever—only photographs—so
that the reader misses all the additional
pleasure that can be got from historical,
personal and architectural notes.
One imagines, from the selection of
photographs and the copious advertise-
ments, that the book has essentially
been planned to show the work that
different architects, builders and trades-
men are doing at the moment. Thus
the South Australian patron, at least,
should find it a useful guide if he is
thinking of building a house or a
factory; and architects and builders in
other States may be interested to com-
pare notes. And for the rest, though
with the limitations mentioned, it does
give some sort of survey of South
Australian architecture.
Beaurepaire of Melbourne
As the title suggests, Sir Frank
Beaurepaire, of The Will to Win, by
Graham Lomas (Heinemann), was a
champion both in swimming and busi-
ness. Son of a British migrant who
was a grocer in Melbourne, an hotel-
manager in Canton, and later pro-
prietor of large boardinghouses and
a pub in Victoria, young, Beaurepaire
went to Albert Park State School, Mel-
bourne, and, having been taught to dog-
paddle at four, and not having the
pennies to go regularly to Stubbs’s sea-
water baths, conducted his earliest
swimming-practice, with a modifica-
tion of the trudgeon-stroke, in the sea
near where gasworks and distillery
drains were discharging. At ten, he
had a year in bed with rheumatic fever,
and against doctor’s orders went back
to swimming.
For an account of Beaurepaire’s
swimming-career, Lomas relies almost
completely on a series of “Sporting
Globe” articles by R. M. Collins, who
managed Beaurepaire’s world - tour
in 1910, a thorough and readable
account of Beaurepaire’s swimming
both at home and on his many trips
abroad in which, as Lomas summarises
it, he became an Australian- and a
world-champion, established 14 world-
records. made a record by representing
Australia in three Olympic games
(1908, 1920 and 1924) where, though
never a gold medallist, he took six
final places ; held the record for the
number of places where he had swum
competitively (N.Z., South Africa,
Canada, U.S., England. Ireland, Scot-
land, Wales, France. Belgium, Ger-
many, Sweden, Finland, Hungary and
the Hawaiian islands), and for having
established records and won champion-
ships against allcomers in every country
he visited.
The lustre Beaurepaire’s great tour
of 1910 brought to an Australia
unawakened to “Boy” Charlton and
the long line of champions to come was
celebrated with a grant of £250 from
the Victorian Government, which was
criticised in England as infringing his
amateur status. In 1911 he was booed
in Sydney when, aftdr the exertions of
his greatest year, he lost races and
practically collapsed ; and his becoming
an instructor in swimming and physical
education to the Victorian Education
Department was considered to make
him professional enough to be barred
from the 1912 Olympics, although the
Victorian Chief Justice gave it as his
opinion that he was in law still an
amateur.
With the war, he had to resign his
commission after an appendicitis opera-
tion. He went abroad for the Y.M.C.A.
as physical-culture expert, organised
Australian Rules football on Salisbury
Plain and entertainments in Armen-
tieres, was mentioned by Monash as
“my head Y.M.C.A. representative,”
and the result of his physical-education
programme was assessed by others as
“particularly felt after the Battle of
Messines Ridge.”
After the war, removed from pro-
fessionalism into selling insurance, he
made such a comeback in swimming
as to be selected for the 1920 Olympics;
and it was on the boat back from the
Games that he met Russell Taylor, a
Canadian returning to Australia, where
he had been working with a Sydney
company, to start a tyre-repair service.
Neither of them unaware of the value
of Beaurepaire’s name in ready-made
publicity, they agreed on a partnership,
dropping the obvious “Ty-re-paire” for
“Advanx” when the company was in-
corporated in 1921. occupying a
cramped wedge-shaped shop in William
Street. Sydney. Beaurepaire had a
practical talent for salesmanship, as
was noticed by a motor-cycle salesman,
George Lloyd, who was to become
Lord Nuffield’s representative in Aus-
tralia:—
“It was his habit,” said Mr. Lloyd,
“to note down the numbers of cars
on which there were bald tyres so
that he could follow-up the owners
and persuade them to have the tyres
retreaded. In those days it was a
simple matter, though possibly not
entirely ethical, to obtain the names
and addresses of car-owners by get-
ting in touch with the motor registra-
tion branch.”
In 1922, the Beaurepaire name
gained new lustre from his bravery
when at Coogee Beach he jumped off
the rocks into the surf to help Jack
Chalmers bring in Milton Coughlan
who had had - one arm torn off by a
shark and the other hanging by a shred,
and in the same year, after he and
Taylor had considered opening a
branch in Melbourne, they parted com-
pany, and the Beaurepaire Tyre Ser-
vice was started in Melbourne—Beaure-
paire and his wife’s brother, Oscar
McKay, of the Harvester McKays, put-
ting in £5OO each.
Amidst the early struggles of the
little company, its amusing row with
the coachbuilding firm next door over
cluttering-up the footpath with cars be-
ing retyred which led to its getting a
building opposite, Beaurepaire had his
last tour as Olympic representative, in
1924. By 1928 he was in the Mel-
bourne City Council, on his way to
becoming Lord Mayor (1940-42); and
in 1933 he advanced from repairing
tyres to making them brand-new, by
which time he was so well regarded that
R. G. Menzies was advised to put his
WITH A WRINGER FOR
ROSEMARY DOBSON
Fine as they’d look in those dark tresses
Laurel chaplets are out of fashion ;
The truth today is, poetesses
Tall as they are with grace and passion
Must set up house and cook and scrub,
Half a housewife and half a singer,
Like wild swans over the washing tub :
So let my tribute be this wringer.
‘Nullum quod tetigit non ornavit’ —
It runs on jewels while you have it;
And when you turn those rhythmic
rollers,
Mixed with the silks and shirts and
collars
S'!ay poetry too, washed bright and fine,
Come out and dance on your clothes line.

money into the Olympic Tyre Company
when it was being formed.
The new tyre-company made its way
against competition from established
international firms, and at the begin-
ning of World War II had installed
machinery, much of it of Australian
manufacture, to make rubber-covered
wire-cable for the first time in Australia.
By the end of the war it had manu-
factured about 250,000 miles of field-
telephone cable, and in a little over a
year from beginning production was
producing 50 types of cable for the
services. The company also contributed
to the war-effort the services of its
general-manager, Charles S. Butt, as
Commonwealth Rubber Controller.
The last phase of this biography, as
it grows so quickly from small business
to industrial empire, shows Beaure-
paire as the instigator of Melbourne’s
Olympic Games. There is evidently
some question of “the steps taken by
Mr. Aitken and Mr. Tanner in 1946”
—but, says Lomas, “I am told on good
authority that he [Beaurepaire] is
believed to have influenced both these
gentlemen in their interest in getting
the Games for Melbourne.” Finally
there is the account of how Melbourne
University’s plan to get leading sports-
men to contribute £lOO each to bring
out the athletic coach Franz Stampfl
grew into the £250.000 Beaurepaire
physical-education centre at Melbourne
University, which was opened in 1956,
some months after his death.
But Beaurepaire, who had foreseen
so many contingencies and built so
many empires, had foreseen and built
the foundations of even his posthumous
fame. Graham Lomas, the Manchester
man who in 1954 became advertising
and publicity man for the Beaurepaire
companies, found himself in demand,
day by day, ostensibly to discuss busi-
ness, but in fact to be indoctrinated as
the Beaurepaire biographer. He has
done a good job. It is a biography
which will not be read for its literary
style, in which men used to dictating
“Yours of the tenth to hand and in
reply will say” are seen preparing them-
selves in their best bibs and tuckers for
quotation ; and where, except for a
statement that Beaurepaire was sad-
dened because of the need for caution
in his friendships, finding that few
people love millionaires Tor themselves,
assessment of the man must be made
on the facts and between the lines. But
for those who look at such huge estab-
lishments as the Footscray factory
opposite page 131, and wonder how one
man could have done it all in 35 years,
it is a careful and detailed answer.
Cooking as Explanation
The second cookbook by Alice B.
Toklas. Gertrude Stein’s friend and
companion in Paris, Aromas and
Flavors (Michael Joseph), seems to
have been ghosted by an American
woman’s magazine journalist, Poppy
Cannon, who contributes an amusing
introduction on how the book was put
together, and speaks with no little pride
of having persuaded Miss Toklas,
whose cooking is superfine in quality
but primitive in method, to use the
electric blender, some of whose pro-
ducts are mentioned here (although
with cake-mixes Miss Cannon was less
successful).
Gertrude Stein wrote plain but ate
fancy, if these recipes were part of
her menus. They are mouth-watering
merely to read, and except maybe on
feast-days, or after a good day at the
races they will have to stay taken as
read for at least one reader, as the two
chapters, “Cooking with Champagne”
and “Cooking with Cognac” will per-
haps suggest. Moreover, Miss Toklas
is not of the party which says that as
soon as you cook wine, it doesn’t
matter what its quality might have
been: “The better the wine,” she says,
“the better the sauce.”
One has already, however, delighted
one’s family with her “Chicken
Marengo,” which she says is “not quite
the classic recipe”; and some of her
biscuits, cream muffins, cakes and
desserts look—well, nice enough to eat.
Her Pistachio Ice-cream, for instance,
her Maraschino Ice-cream, her Snow-
ball encrusted with Violets . . . which
reminds one of her chapter on Ratafias,
or flavored brandies:
Infuse lib. of violet-petals, no
stamens, please, in 1 quart of
brandy . . .
Story Prizes
A prize of 100-guineas for the best
short-story received each year for the
A.N.A.’s quarterly journal, “Anapress,”
is offered by the Victorian board of the
association, and a fee of £lO 10s. will
be paid for each story published. There
will also be a short-story competition
for school-children between the ages
of 10 and 13 years and between 14
and 17 years, with prizes of £5 ss. for
the best written by a boy and a girl in
each group.
The judges will be C. B. Christesen,
Alan Marshall and a member of the
Victorian board.
The Mandarins: Simone de Beauvoir
(Fontana). The story of what happened
in literary and political circles in Paris
after the Liberation. The author
should know what she is writing about,
because she was born above the Cafe
de la Rotonde in Montparnasse and
must have lived all her life in the sur-
roundings she describes, emerging as
one of the leaders of the Existentialist
movement after the war. The novel
itself is long (763 pages), but well trans-
lated. It won the French Prix Gon-
court.
A SONG AND A DANCE
The lean man of the desert speaks:
Your hearts are stale from greed and
care.
O come out in the desert air
And wash your hearts in the desert creeks
For love comes when the heart is bare.
We piped to you, but you did not dance :
We sang you dirges, you did not weep.
Another came with wine and bread
And sat down with a prostitute,
For she loved much though her sins were
great.
Come eat and drink with us, he said,
For the tree is known by its fruit.
We piped to you, but you did not dance ;
We sang you dirges, you did not weep.
For a dancing girl they lopped one’s
head,
And nailed the other upon a tree,
And laughed till the tears ran down,
For we
Can tell this tree by its fruit, they said,
And give the lie to his mockery,
We piped to you, but you did not dance ;
We sang you dirges, you did not weep.
