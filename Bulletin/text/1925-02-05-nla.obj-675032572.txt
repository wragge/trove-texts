The Red Page
H. G. Wells and the Pedagogues
The underlying principle of our educa-
tional methods is still the system of rewards
and punishments upon which depended the
Dantesque theocracy of the Middle Ages. It
is founded upon the infallibility of a master
as a source of all knowledge and the pos-
sessor of the wondrous power to make an
unfaltering distinction between right and
wrong, what is good form and what is “not
cricket.”' He is not an elder comrade in the
adventure of life, but a timid Mussolini.
Upon this medievalism (which is some-
times alluded to as the great and glorious
tradition of the past) has been grafted the
competitive principle of industrialism,
popularly supposed by those who have trans-
ferred their allegiance from Genesis to
Science to have its sanction in that con-
venient law‘of nature, “the Survival of the
Fittest.” The earnest enthusiasm of Dr.
Arnold of Rugby, who strove to make his
pupils Christian gentlemen and governed
his school on the principles of the Old Tes-
tament, has proved to be the foundation of
the modern worship of athletics and good
form. The utilitarian outlook of last cen-
tury brought in scientific and technical
studies and drove out the futilities of Latin
and Greek verse composition. It is obliga-
tory in our competitive times upon every
secondary school to obtain results in the
examination chamber which has replaced the
thumb-screw and the rack of the Dark Ages.
Putting upon one side all fond illusions,
success in the examination lists is commonly
regarded as the acid-test of teaching effici-
ency. The awarding of marks and prizes
(beautifully bound and bearing the school
crest) has superseded the rod as an artificial
stimulus to the acquisition of knowledge,
no longer generally looked upon as an end
in itself, but merely as a means to greater
and more material rewards.
Then there is discipline. Compared with
the savagery of Christ’s Hospital it has
become a thin and waterish diet. Boys, how-
ever, must be kept quietly receptive, like
fledglings in a nest, so that the. master may
imprint upon the white page of memory the
nicely prepared scraps, and tips, which must
be faithfully reproduced in the examination-
room to obtain good results. To-day no hon-
State public school can afford to do badly in
sports, so there has come into being that
latest of school paradoxes, “Compulsory
Games,” which, it is confidently alleged, de-
velop both muscle and character. The school
must also set a tone in straw hats or other
badge of distinction, and in straw-hat manners,
for no scholastic institution following in the
wake of the English tradition has ventured
since the time of Dr. Arnold to ignore the
virtues of conspicuous respectability.
Into this pedagogic paradise has intruded
a serpent, a tempter, or rather a whole nest
of serpents, in the form of psycho-analysis,
the playway, self-government in class, the
Dalton Plan, and (last of all) a monster
self-styled “paedocentrieism.” To make
matters more troublesome, Mr. H. G. Wells
butted in last year with “The Story of a
Great Schoolmaster, being a Plain Account
of the Life and Ideas of Sanderson, of
Oundle,” a headmaster to whom there came
a unique opportunity. ,It must be added that
Mr, Sanderson had the combination of brains
and courage to seize the opportunity and
achieve success. Sanderson’s education was
obtained first in a parish school. He was
never proficient in any sport, and yet he
developed character. He became a student
teacher in an elementary school, and
obtained a scholarship at Durham Univar-
sity, where he did well in theology and
mathematics. He passed at Cambridge, took
a fairly good degree in mathematics, and
finally did well in the Natural Science Tripos.
Before he, went to Oundle he was physics
master at Dulwich College. He was a fine,
energetic, buoyant personality with a great
and abiding faith in his ideas. His great aim
was to interest boys in their work, replacing
the competitive motive by the more vital
stimulus of interest in the work itself. Here
is an extract from his gospel contained in a
speech delivered by him in London before
the Reconstruction Council :• —
Everyone feels that competition destroys the crea-
tive, inventive life. And yet the spirit of eompeti-
tion holds sway not in commerce only nor in diplo-
macy, but in the schools where the methods are
largely competitive, possessive... AVe claim that
scientific thought should be the inspiring spirit in
school work. Science is essentially creative and co-
operative, its outlook is onwards towards change, it
means searching for the truth, it demands research
and experiment, and does not rest on authority.
Sanderson’s great objective was to link the
life of the school to that of the community;
to stir the imagination of boys by an appeal
to their creative energies, not to deaden it
by the forced imposition of authoritative
teaching.
This,' then, is the type of man of whom
Mr. Wells writes with enthusiastic admira-
tion. One would have thought that school-,
masters would have welcomed such a con-
tribution to pedagogy. The contrary ap-
pears to be the case, if one may take seri-
ously the semi-contemptuous references to
Mr. Wells’s book made in the course of
several speech-day discourses. The reason
tor this hostility seems to lie not in a wish
to depreciate the work of Mi*. Sanderson,
in a dislike of Mr. Wells him-
self. This novelist, prophet, biologist, theo-
logian and philosopher was himself once a
schoolmasterT It is more correct to say that
he has never ceased to be a teacher and
preacher who has had the presumption to
take the whole world of me pi for his class.
It is possibly this assumption, and the scant
respect with which he has itreated the high
scholasticism of the English, public schools,
that makes, him so hateful t)o the pedagogic
nourished upon the iticeties and in-
hibitions of the classical traditions. His
eyes are more on the futu re than on the
past. Moreover, he has uttered bitter criti-
cisms which have gone lionne. Did he not
say of the great English schools that “the
general scholastic atmosphei’e admits of no
inspiration at all”? And, a;fain: “Have we
no heroic or original school! ;eachers? What
part do our leading headings ters play in the
intellectual world? When does one see
freshness or power in a schoolmaster’s dis-
course ; does one find schoolmasters caring
keenly for fine or beautiful things ? Who
does not know the schoolmaster’s trite, safe
admirations, his thin, evasive enthusiasms
for cricket, etc. —his timid refuge in ‘good
form,’ his deadly silences?”
Two admissibns in the last issue of the
Australian Teacher, published by the
Teachers’ Guild of N.S.W., are pertinent
comment upon the strictures of Mr. Wells.
The first is in the editorial: —•
No earnest teacher can rest satisfied with what
we cannot dignify as the tendency, but must stig-
matise as the drift, in the educational policy of the
non-State schools. During the last ten years the
general body of teachers has shown a declining in-
terest in the themes and methods of education.
The other is a remark in the address of the
retiring president of the Guild, with refer-
ence to a course of lectures upon education
recently delivered in Sydney by Professor
Adams of London :
To many practical teachers the lectures must have
been unsatisfying. But this was due rather to the
nature of the subject. A strong bias in favor of new
ideas would have aroused antagonism.
It is this deadness which alarms those who
earnestly desire the continued existence of
educational institutions outside the State
schools. Yet no institutions lacking enthusi-
asm, or inspired merely by fear, can further
life. Hope and enthusiasm, not fear, are
the creative principles in human affairs. To
use the words of Bertrand Russell: “It is
because modern education is so seldom in-
spired by a great hope that it so seldom
achieves a great result.”
A. N. USHER.
Three Viewpoints and a Fallacy
Three new books “out of the East” that
may conveniently be considered together are
Western Civilisation and the Far East, by
Stephen King-Hall (Methuen) ; The Clash
of Color, by Basil Mathews (Edinburgh
House P'ress) ; and The Military Side of
Japanese Life, by Captain M. D. Kennedy
(Constable).
The first, by a man who has lived in close
contact with many of the persons and events
he speaks of, is a survey of the greatest
historical drama of modern times, the redis-
covery of Further Asia by the West. When
the seafaring Portuguese reached Canton in
151 G they did not realise that China, the
land of Tsin, was the same country that the
overlanding missionary friars centuries be-
fore called Cathay, a name which the Rus-
sians, who approached China via Siberia,
still use. They thought it was a new dis-
covery, and they and all the European
nations that followed them presumed upon
the superiority that sea-power gave them to
bully and exploit the huge, inert country
as the pioneers of the landway had never
dared to do. Aggression foSowed aggres-
sion down to modern times. Then a
startling event took place. A group of
islands, ranged on the flank of Asia in much
the same way as the British Isles flank
Europe, had been forced out of its self-
chosen policy of isolation by the visit of an
''American ship. Its statesmen, realising
their country’s weakness and how Europe
was enslaving China, set deliberately to work
to forge out of their mediaeval material a
modern nation that would be strong enough
to withstand the threatened impact of the
West. In due course their weapon was
sufficiently tempered, and China was the
handiest to try it on. With one voice
Europe prophesied that the big nation would
detour the small; but 400 million pairs of
enraged, chopsticks were impotent even
against the moderate armament of Japan.
An alliance with Britain gave the hustling
parvenu a fresh breathing-space ufitil she
felt strong enough to look for higher game.
Again the Western critics went astray when
the little islanders tackled Russia and laid
the great continental bogey that had given
European statesmen nightmares for two
generations.
When the West wiped its eyes clear of the
slaughter of the Great War and turned them
once more towards Asia, it might easily have
imagined, like the Portuguese voyagers, that
it was discovering a new world. The decen-
tralisation of anarchy had hurried on the
industrialisation of China, and civil war
had provided her with an army of millions.
The Western Powers still claimed their
privileges, but their heyday was over. With
Germany, Austria and Russia China had
resumed relations on terms of perfect equal-
ity. Japan had become a hive of modern
industry and the first military Power in
the Pacific. It was a close season for the
European concessionaire. Japan tacitly pro-
claimed a Monroe doctrine for Asia, while
claiming as a moral right liberty for her
multiplying people to expand. Behind
them both was Russia, which had never
lost touch with the East, and was
still master of the landway. The net result
of contact between the West and Furthest
Asia had been the creation of modern Japan
and the birth of a Westernised China, coun-
tries with high birth-rates and populations
for ever on the increase, which for the first
time in their history are acquiring the
to use force in the pursuit of what
they believe to be their .iust demands. The
author of “Western Civilisation and the Far
East” ends his vivid story on a note of
hesitating altruism and suggestions for re-
moving some minor points of friction.
Not so the author of “The Clash of
Color.” He has a robust philosophy. Paint-
ing his picture on a wider canvas, he visual-
ises the coming conflict, not only between
the East and West, but with Africa mixed
in as well. He quotes the diabolical words
hurled at an audience of 20.000 negroes by
Marcus Garvey, native of the West Indies
and creator of the African Communities
League. “The bloodiest of all wars is yet
to come,” said Garvey, “when Europe will
match its strength against Asia, and that
will be the negroes’ opportunity to draw
the sword for Africa’s redemption.” The
solution of this bigger problem, at which
the minds of white men might well be stag-
gered, is to be found, Mr. Mathews thinks,

It is a relief to turn to something con-
crete and detached. The author of the thir
volume, Captain M. D. Kennedy, after bei g
wounded in France, was detailed by the
British War Office to the Japanese Army as
a Language Officer, an accommodating 1
stitution by which the various armies keep
each other advised during peace of the Into
improvements in the art of war. Kennedy
is not a propagandist but a technical man.
He casts a cool, discriminating eye over the
Japanese army in the field m Siberia, Man-
churia, Korea and Northern China, and
records its operations and the foibles of its
personnel with an engaging air of cntica
detachment. He finds the Japanese soldier
lacking in resource at times of stress, imi-
tative and without initiative, but actuate
by a fanatic loyalty and a tradition (still
existing amongst British officers serving on
the Indian frontier) that self-destruction is
better than surrender. He finds all classes
in Japan believing that Japan must win an
outlet for her increasing numbers; and lie
discusses the military chances of a great
Pacific war. .
All three observers portray a world in
which population pressure is rapidly reacn-
ing the bursting-point. The humanitarian
hopes that by agreement, concession and soft
words an overcrowded planet can keep itseit
divided into water-tight compartments. I lie
militant Christian proposes to dash the bar-
riers down and extinguish the differences o
race in a religious confederation. Ihe soldiei
stolidly looks at his friend the enemy s rifle;
then lifts his own down and polishes tne
sight. There is, however, a fundamental
fallacy in all three books. They each be-
lieve that the problem of a country that is
crowded can be solved by a country that is
not crowded. They imagine that if Japan,
for instance, could transfer 10 millions of
her human surplus to Australia, Japan s
problem would be solved. In a sense they
feel it is the duty of countries like Australia
to provide some such solution. They ignore
the fact that the average increase of any
people, taken over long intervals, is less than
2 per cent, per annum, and that the poten-
tial increase of the species, when its natuial
fecundity is unchecked by population pres-
sure, is more than 6 per cent. glance at
a shilling interest table will tell the reader
how long it would take Japan to replace her
emigrated millions and reach the same condi-
tion of congestion as before. Unfortunately
statesmen do not usually consult interest
tables when they “think imperially. i
their country is small and overcrowded they
threaten or cajole; if it is large nnd empty,
like Australia, they apologise and let things
slide While this fundamental fallacy re-
mains rooted in all international relations,
the simple viewpoint of the soldier seems
the safest.
FENG-SHUI.
Blake After Many Years
“What think you of Blake r may well
be asked of a reader who, beginning with the
“Golden Treasury” selections, presently ex-
tended his purview to the Aldme Poetical
Works,” and by degrees to the "1 rophetical
Books” and the huge mass of commentary
that surrounds their text. That Blake has
come to stand for something else than mere
poet is shown by the Oxford edition, which
shies only at the reproduction in toto ot the
three major prophecies. His “mere poetry
we may take as classic; what of the some-
thing else” ? How stands it with Blake
the mystic, the prophet, the symbolist?
The first two aspects we may profitably
neglect; hut symbolism decidedly falls with-
in art and literature, and this aspect we may
profitably discuss, if we can thereby get any
nearer to determining a much-used and much-
debated, but seldom defined, term.
Symbolism involves what may develop into
a philosophical or mystical theory of the
universe, as constituted by ‘correspon-
dences,” analogies, spiritual kinships of signi-
ficance. As a poetic theory and practice,
it implies a sense of the necessity to clear
out of poetry all simile and metaphor which
can be catalogued under those mere terms of
ornamental rhetoric and to present only the
one organic image, which is the necessary
and only possible vehicle of the organic
(not merely systematic) unity of inter-
orbed significance which is the content of
poetry. The form is thus constituted, as
all true form is, from within.
Now let it be observed that, though such
a condensed statement may sound portentous,
there is not implied any breach with the
high tradition. As a philosophy, symbolism
is prepared to justify itself like any other;
as art or poetry, too, neither can it claim
to transcend that universe common or acces-
sible to all, nor should it set up any heresy in
face of the catholic faith in the indissoluble
oneness of beauty and significance of soul
and form. I do not think that Blake, or his
most distinguished follower, W. B. Yeats, has
set up any heresy; but their practice has
often been such as, in less strenuously disci-
plined minds, might be conducive to scandal.
More important is the matter of Blake’s
myth. As poetry, after all, is a sophisticated
product, and as symbolic poetry is a highly
elaborate kind of poetry, we cannot refuse it
the use of any of the dialects, or (say, rather)
higher vernaculars, of poetry—on two con-
ditions : first that it renew, not simply I'epeat,
them; secondly, that there be no excessive
divagation from the oecumenical sense of
literature.
To come at Blake through his follower :
When Yeats employs Celtic mythology as a
symbolic vehicle he runs the risk of being
charged by those who know it with sophis-
ticating it; by those who do not with resur-
recting things long lost from the general
mind of poetry. In my opinion, he goes free
of both charges. But, in his best symbolic
work, “The Wind Among the Reeds,” that
Red Hanralian and Michael Robartes who
appear in the titles are merely a vexation.
To know who they are, and what they are
meant to be, we require to know their sagas;
that of Ilanrahan (originally O’Sullivan
Rua) their maker has written, that of
Robartes he has withheld. And we cannot
say that in either case we are much better
or' worse off for the comprehension of his
poetry. With Blake, the case is
The symbolic vision is presented to u , _ '■
in terms of poetic imagery, but in a mytho-
logical system invented and elaborated tor
the nonce. That is to say, the symbol ceases
to be essentially beauty, and becomes a scnpt,
a language to the acquiring of which we
must direct our first attention, to the inter-
preting of it our next. The poetry comes
through often enough to reward us during
our toil; but, kind for kind, is there any
difference in that from Wordsworth. .
For it is not merely the reader who is
crushed by the mythological system ■ it is
Blake’s own inspiration as well. In elahorat-
ing all that vast machinery he forgot that,
while certainly “Exuberance is beauty,
minutely pigeonholed systematics is a differ-
ent thing, and that to art as well as to logic
Occam’s famous law applies; Entia non sunt
multiplicand praeter neoessttatem. Cer-
tainly one sees the enormous effort to advance
beyond the narrow compass of the minor
prophecies, where the system could not dis-
play or explain itself, and past the scrap-
book capharnaum of “Jerusalem,’ into the
epic amplitude of “Vala.” But one also feels
the strain. And while the system demanded
a large scale for its working, it was at once
too complicated and too monotonously self-
repeating to furnish forth an epic. _
The mythology is a hybrid thing. It
purports to be a transcript of vision; it is
a polemic against Swedenborg and a professed
improvement of his system; and, in the
long run, as Swedenborg could not dissociate
his “correspondences” from Scripture, neither
could Blake his Zoas, States and Spaces.
And he often has his dreadful reward. The
following, for instance, has indeed its mean-
ing (“Jerusalem,” 71) :
Peachey had North Wales, Shropshire, Cheshire and
the Isle of Man.
His Emanation is Mehetabel terrible arid lovely upon
the Mountains.
Brertun had Yorkshire, Durham, Westmoreland and
his Emanation
Is Ragan, she adjoined to Slade, and produced Gonorill
far beaming.
But it is not even that parody of the Bible
which Nietzsche attempted in Zaratliustra;
it is Blake’s parody of himself.
What is the result? Our judgment op
Blake must practically coincide with that
of Swinburne. Intemperately and foolishly
as Swinburne put it in the preface to his
second edition, there are two Blakes. And
for our purposes we may state it thus, that
the more Blake is controlled by tradition the
purer and more valuable the beauty he
brings forth; but, when he abandons him-
self to belief in the literal truth of his in-
spired visions, the more does he tend, not,
as was once thought, to madness, but to in-
coherent pedantry. We may see it in his
designs. See how he gains when lie is con-
strained to turn from the ornamentation of
his own text to the “illustration,” say, of
Milton’s “Nativity Hymn,” Dante or Job.
The vision is there, and unmistakably Blake’s
own; but how the necessity to follow the
words of another re-acts on his powers ot'
design and both strings them up and refines
them! The following passage is from a
poem which really belongs among the “Pro-
phetic Books” and requires, if not commen-
tary, at least as much hard thought as any
of them; but compared with their general
style does it not gain, even in energy alone,
from the discipline of a stricter measure? —
When I had my defiance given
The sun stood trembling in Heaven;
The moon, that glow’d remote below,
Became leprous and white as snow ;
And every soul of men on the earth
Felt affliction, and sorrow, and sickness, and dearth.
Loss flam’d in my path, and the sun was hot
With the bows of my mind and the arrows of thought.
My bowstring fierce with ardor breathes ;
My arrows glow in their golden sheaves;
My brothers and fathers march before;
The heavens drop with human gore.
CHRIS. BRENNAN.
The Devil and Science
Few readers can pretend to that direct and
personal interest which “C.McL.’’ shows m
the foibles of Luther’s Devil (R.P.
15/l/’25), even though ‘'we owe it to Luther
that a doctor in Sydney is now able to dis-
cuss scientific truth and let the. mediaeval
church go hang.” Fewer still will address
themselves to the task of determining why the
church of the Middle Ages should hung
itself, either literally or liturgically, because
of what a twentieth-century doctor may say
of its reputed antipathy to science.
The results of this latest “post-mortem
are not revelatory of anything that escaped
unprejudiced historians in the past... Fol-
lowing Hartmann Grisar, “C.McL.” pro-
nounces Luther to have been “totally igno-
rant of natural science.” He was that, and
more. It is a commonplace of historical
criticism that, at the very time, a
Pope was patronising the writings
of Copernicus, the German ex-monk was call-
ing him “a fool” for having turned astronomy
upside-down. It is conceivable, nevertheless,
that by breaking away from Papal dogma—
though he was soon to be enmeshed in
dogmas of his own making—he set in motion,
somehow, forces which will ultimately en-
sure the long-promised (and long-delayed)
triumph of Science over Religion. If Eng-
lish has a meaning, such is the only infer-
ence to be drawn from “C.McL.’s” remarks
in this connection. It is a pleasing fancy,
and much has been said about it.
Until a few years ago there was no sub-
ject under the literary sun about which more
solemn nonsense was talked and written than
the hostility that was supposed to have
existed between scientists and theologians in
the Middle Ages. Now, however, that writers
of history have given place to historians, the
“man in the street” —the lineal descendant
of Macaulay’s schoolboy—-has no better ex-
cuse than a University lecturer for perpetu-
ating a fiction that marred the old-fashioned
text-books. It is no longer safe to confuse
medievalism with obscurantism, and by suc-
cessive false steps to deduce an essential
opposition to liberty of thought; and for the
simple reason that, in a period amazingly
prolific of men of genius, most of the leading
scientists were ecclesiastics, and all, clerics
and laymen, had the generous and constant
support of the Popes. Nicholas de Cusa
was a canon; Copernicus was befriended by
Clement VII.. and his book treating of the
Pythagorean idea was dedicated to Paul 111. ;-
Clavius and Kircher, renowned as astronomers,
belonged to an Order whose members wel-
comed Kepler to Gratz and Ingolsdadt after
his condemnation at Tubingen; Columbus,
Eustachius, Varolius, Malpighi, Vesalius
(“The Father of Anatomy”), and Guy de
Chauliac were all Papal physicians; Albertus
Magnus, the only scholar to whose name is
irrevocably attached the title “Great,’ was
a Dominican; Roger Bacon was a Francis-
can • and Galileo was buried in the robes of
the Third Order of the “Little Poor Man.
The list might be extended almost indefi-
nitely, but enough has been said to show that
there is something wildly wrong with the
argument that “Papal dogma” precluded the
possibility of untrammelled scientific re-
search. The one thing the mediaeval church
required of its members was that they dis-
tinguished between ascertained facts and
pretty theories. That this was, and is, quite
in accord with the best thought of every age,
from Aristotle’s to our own, is emphasised
in the following words of Dr. Thomas
Dwight, late Parkman Professor of Anatomy
at Harvard: “True science demands that
theories should not be given as facts, nor
working hypotheses revered as laws. This
is the plain course of sense and honesty. Un-
fortunately this is so often lost sight of that
much lias been palmed off on the public as
science which is but its poorest counterfeit.”
All dogmas are the same in this respect.
Freud or Jung, or even “C.McL,” might
have aired his theories in the Middle Ages,
but only as theories. The schoolmen were
trained observers; and the secular arm. was
strong.

The Message About the Cros.s, by C.' J. Cadoux
(Allen and Unwin). This message, in the author s
opinion, is but feebly given in the Christian church
of to-day, not because it is regarded*'hs unimportant,
but because so much of the traditional language in
which it has been conveyed has become meaning-
less. He sets himself the task of reconstructing, not
the historical details of the story, but the meaning
of the event in the mind of Him , who was the
central figure.

“Command,” this author is sure of an eager public.
“Race” is a simple enough story of a group ot
families in South Barnet before motor-cars and
factories and Progress surged over the fields and
sucked them into the whirlpool that is London. A
bit of home life; a bit of “chapel” ; shopkeepers;
striving young men and women —in short, the m-
gradients which make a Race: all these has the
writer sketched strongly an an invigoratm 0 and
amusing novel. . ,
Builders of Peace, by H. M Swanwick (Swarthy

gives an account of the growth, vicissitudes and
achievements of the Union of Democratic Control.
Founded soon after the outbreak of war, and having
as its principal sponsors Ramsay Macdonald, Charles
Trevelyan Norman Angell and the recently dead
E D ‘Morel, the Union has accomplished no refoims
worth mentioning, but claims to have educated public
opinion and to “stand as a challenge to the doctune
of a narrow nationalism.”
In the Land of Youth, by James Stephens (Mac-
millan). Mr. Stephens is one of that band of literary
men who have done so much in recent years to
explore the legendary past of his country. His
volumes of Irish fairy tales, Deirdre, The Clock
of Gold” and others, have made his name familiar
to all lovers of Irish-Celtic folklore. This recent
contribution has all the charm of its
and, like them, is lightened by touches of quaint
humor. Thus: The night is dark, and on the eve of
the feast of Samhain demons are about. King Maeie
offers the prize of a gold-hilted sword to him who
will dare to go abroad. Nera, the youth, accepts
the challenge, and goes out on the adventures which
make up the material of the story. He finds a man hang-
ins* from a tree who had been sentenced to death 101
crime “You are not dead?” said he to the man above
him. “Not out and out,” the man replied; when
they were hanging me I was very thirsty, and ever
since 1 have been too thirsty to die. ho Nera took
him down and, carrying him to a house, propped
him up and gave him water. The man drank thiee
buckets dry. “That’s not a bad drink, said heia,
“and if you’re not satisfied ’tis because nothing wilt
satisfy you. Come back to your torment, my soul.
So he took him back to the tree and strung him
up again. “Do you feel any better now, my
darling?” “I feel splendid, said the outlaw, 111
be dead in a jiffey.” Nera left him there ‘ swinging
easily and buoyantly.”
❖
From Arthur Lynch, the brilliant Austialian
ex-member of the House of Commons who fought
on the Boer side in the w r ar of 1900 and thereabouts:
Touching the letter of “Rio” (B. in
“My Life Story,” now published, I have taken the
opportunity of stating my point of view with
reference to the South African War; I am content
to leave it to the judgment of good Austialians.
All through my life I have been guided by principles,
such as “Fair Play” : “Reward to Merit Only ,
“Democracy, not Hereditary Privilege.” Most men
agree at once—till it comes to putting these maxims
into practice. I did not flinch, but pursued them
to the end, and for that offence I have endured years
of misrepresentation, disparagement and difficulty.
What I thought about the origin of the war is now
accepted generally even here in England It was
artificially prepared by the insolvent Chartered Com-
pany with the connivance of Chamberlain, to rob
the Transvaal of its mines in order to balance
accounts: and all sorts of abominable means were
used to deceive the British people and to create
hatred against the Boers. I saw a young Republic
being downed in the interests of a wicked Imperialism,
and I did what I could to defend it. In spite of
what “Rio” says, Australia as a State was not
implicated; but in his desire to create a wrong
impression he says I fought against my own country-
men. Imagine for a moment the desperate pel u
to Australia of this rising, in defence of their
freedom of a small nation of farmers thousands of
miles away! No! When a man stands at the bar,
in defence of his own name and his life, he has a
right to appeal to principles deeper laid m human
nature than claptrap, fraud and prejudice. How
could I fight against my own countrymen when one
of the great impelling motives in my whole career
has been the ever-abiding hope of doing something to
bring honor to Australia? I appeal as an Aus-
tralian to Australians, to their sentiments of democ-
racy and of fair play.

In making his dream a fact,
Burroughs held rigidly to his high
ideals of precision and accuracy.
He was a bookkeeper —one of countless thousands
doing the most monotonous of work —adding, subtract-
ing, multiplying and dividing figures.
Certainly many others must have realized that two
and two always totalled four, that five times five
always equalled twenty-five and that three from ten
always left seven. But William Seward Burroughs,
working in a small Auburn bank, saw in that absolute
inflexibility of numbers the fact that here was work for
machines rather than for men!
With a half-formed dream of a figuring machine in
his mind, Burroughs left the Auburn bank and sought
out the machine shop of Joseph Boyer in St. Louis.
Here he brought to completion the first practical adding
and listing machine to be successfully applied to figure
work in all lines of‘business.
It is a long way from that humble St. Louis machine
shop to the present Detroit institution that is Burroughs’
greatest monument —but a way made straight because
those who control the destinies of this institution have
always kept faith with the ideals of its founder.
Today the chairman of the Board of Directors of
the Burroughs Adding Machine Company is the same
Joseph Boyer to whose little machine shop the inventor
Burroughs first came. And A. J. Doughty, the young
apprentice-mechanic whom Boyer assigned to assist
Burroughs, is now vice-president of the company.
During the forty years since William Seward Burroughs gave business
its first adding machine, the Burroughs Adding Machine Company has come
to be a world-wide organization, serving business everywhere through its
sales and service organizations. It now employs more than 10,000 people;
it has branch factories in Nottingham, England, and Windsor, Canada.
Today, the Burroughs Company manufactures adding, bookkeeping and
calculating machines —each in a wide variety of styles and sizes. But Bur-
roughs has never been content merely to build machines. It has continually
analysed and studied the figure problems of business—anticipating figuring
needs and devising systems and methods by which business men every-
where may reduce costs and increase efficiency.
Today—business, large and small, in all parts of the world draws upon
the rich experience and great resources of the Burroughs organization for
counsel and assistance in the solution of its figure problems. This helpful
assistance is yours for the asking.
Telephone your local Burroughs representative and obtain expert assist-
ance and advice upon the problems peculiar to your own individual business.
You can do this without obligating yourself in any way. It is a continu-
ation of the valuable service first rendered to business by William Seward
Burroughs. Why not avail yourself of it —today?

The Watchers.
All spick and span the liner goes
South-eastward through the Heads;
A wake of foam behind her lies,
A sparkling road she treads.
From raking funnels, fresh with paint,
Thick rolling smoke is poured,
As bowing low her shapely head
She greets her Ocean lord.
Seaward she steams, though landward set
Seaward and sea-sent tide,
While o’er her silver seagulls wheel,
And wide-winged gannets glide.
Her brass-work glitters like new gold;
Sunlit, her steel-work shines;
The waves wash smoothly down her sides
In undulating lines.
Her topmast wears a silken flag,
Wind-blown and floating free;
A porpoise shoal with glossy backs
Shows her the way to sea.
As swaying, swinging, to the swell,
She heads away from land,
Upon the cliffs above the Gap
Two fond farewellers stand.
Fond watchers, hiding side by side,
As she goes rolling by,
With waving handkerchiefs aloft,
They signal her “Good-bye.”
Betwixt her and the sea-washed coast
Miles grow, waves fall and rise,
But still the patient watchers gaze
With set and steady eyes.
Hours pass, day dies and grey twilight
The far horizon dulls;
Landward the wide-winged gannets speed,
Landward the silver gulls.
Lights spring to life on height and beach,
Lamps shine and beacons burn ;
Night falls, the liner fades from sight,
Homeward the watchers turn.

Fulfilment.
A star is up at the top of the pine
And you are down at the foot;
Shall I climb the tree to pluck the star
Or feast with you on the root?
Shall I, in climbing, dizzy and lost,
Fall while the bright birds fly,
Scorched by the light of a lonely star,
Or gorge with you....and die?
Maybe the light of my eyes will rise
And blaze in the midnight blue;
And down in the depths of earth I’ll turn
My cold, cold lips to you.

The Bird.
A year ago Life caught a bird’s wild soul.
Within her cruel hands it weighed as light
As thistle-down poised on a breeze for
flight
Towards unguessed gardens with a secret
goal.
Life caged it, boasting proudly that it throve
Because with broken spirit it would stand
Without a tremor on her ruthless hand,
Trained to believe its keeper’s name was
Love.
We are Life’s captives in drab garments clad,
Who once with wild bird-song went sing-
ing far.
The joy that was our loss she counts her
gain;
For Life confuses sweet things with things
sad.
With the red rose how many souls there
are
Whose songs die daily on a thorn of pain?

Transmutation.
The city sleeps in stone.
Drenched with dim quietness,
O’er her, in warm caress,
Translucent night has thrown
One dream-dark tress!
Sweetheart o’ dusk is she,
Who day-long recked of naught.
Night’s fragrant lips have brought
Her haunting mystery
Beyond our thought!
She, whom day ne’er could tame,
’Neath her dark passion’s power,
Like some enchanted flower,
Blooms in chameleon flame
One golden hour!

The Orange Grove.
I know a pleasant garden
That looks upon the sea;
And it.is full of oranges,
A hundred to the tree.
All day beneath the houghs I lie
And watch, set bright against the sky,
Among gold globes and dark green leaves,
The silver web a spider weaves.
All day there is the sounding surf,
The happy smell of sun-sweet turf,
And I can lie in waving grass
And watch the drowsy moments pass.
I waken at the set of sun
When the hills darken one by one
And pluck an orange from the tree,
And pause to eat it leisurely.
’Tis good when all the stars come out
And fireflies glow and crickets shout
Along the homeward path to foot,
My pockets crammed with golden loot!

A PLATFORM SAID TO BE NEW.
Although individual resolutions of the Mel-
bourne Conference crept into light a day or
so after they were adopted, the 1924-27
Federal Labor platform, in its complete
form, was withheld from publication for
nearly three months. Perhaps it was thought
to require more carpentry, seeing that a
general election is not far off, but if so the
carpenters did their job clumsily. Plank 7
of the “fighting platform” demands “naviga-
tion laws to provide for the protection of
Australian shipping against unfair competi-
tion.” Such laws have been in force since
March, 1920 —unless, indeed, it be the un-
fair competition of Moscow that was thought
of —and a full and particular criticism of
them may be obtained from any Tas-
manian not blind or dumb. There is
a cry also for “Commonwealth train-
ing establishments for returned sol-
diers” (25,000 Diggers have received voca-
tional training already), and for a “repatria-
tion scheme to be definitely brought into
operation” (the Repatriation Department
dates from April 8,191 S), “the first instal-
ment of £22,000.000” (£144.000,000 had been
spent on June 30) “to be placed in the hands
of the Board of Repatriation Trustees forth-
with.” Apparently this obsolete stuff was
retained because the delegates, wanted to
make a bid for the returned-soldier vote and
couldn’t think of anything fresh. The “fight-
ing” platform contains 18 planks, one of
which is our fraudulent old friend Restric-
tion of Borrowing, and attached to it is a
“general” platform which, in some respects,
is tediously repetitive. Maintenance of a
White Australia, the first plank of the fight-
ing platform, re-appears as the second plank
of the general platform. Abolition of the
Senate is mentioned three times. This par-
ticular proposal is especially interesting to
the inhabitants of the smallest State. Their
struggling industries having been wickedly
injured and their tourist traffic well nigh
ruined by the Labor navigation policy,
it is now suggested that they should be de-
prived of six of their eleven Commonwealth
members —that the Federal system, in short,
should be destroyed. One can imagine the
enthusiasm with which the abolition of the
Senate will be championed by the Labor
candidates in the Speck next year.
* * * *
There is an occasional mention of Aus-
tralia in the platform, but huge sections of
it (or them) might have been constructed by
a hairy gentleman in Moscow for use in
Bokhara or Azerbaijan. “The socialisation
of industry, production, distribution and ex-
change” is declared to be the “objective,” and
it is the Red Russian “objective” likewise.
Banks and “principal industries” (including
agriculture, presumably) are to be “nation-
alised” and run after a fashion by boards
“on which the workers and the community
shall have representation”; and these boards
are to be subject to a “Supreme Economic
Council”—so called because it will De
superior to Parliament and, when Socialism
is in full bloom, will make that institution
superfluous—just as in Russia, where Par-
liaments were abolished in 1917. And lest
the farmers shy at the proposal to national-
ise principal industries, they are promise! a
Federal Bureau of Agriculture, a Rural
Credit branch of the Commonwealth
Bank, “the encouragement of co-opera-
tion, more up-to-date methods of marketing
our products, a comprehensive system of
water conservation and irrigation,” and
other old props, mostly stolen from the Coun-
try party, although there is one addition
which is perfectly original—“the extension of
the Commonwealth Shipping Line for the
purpose of securing cheaper freights on the
carriage of our products, both inter-State
and overseas.” Considering how the mari-
time unions have been behaving during the
past three months, and that the Common-
wealth Line, charging the same cargo rates
as the privately-owned steamers, managed to
lose £2,797,000 during the last two years for
which accounts are available, the new item
is superlatively humorous. On immigration
the Conference might have been expected to
say something definite, seeing that Australia
is struggling with the beginnings of a pro-
blem caused by the locking of the American
door against hordes from Southern Europe.
Even a suggestion that the U.S. quota sys-
tem should be copied would have been some-
thing. However, the delegates contented
themselves with the familiar whine that “the
present immigration policy of the capitalist
Governments is directed to flooding Australia
with cheap labor,” and with the dreary
old counsel of perfection that “land, housing
accommodation and employment he provided
for overseas immigrants before they are in-
vited to come to Australia.” The fact that
thousands of immigrants not of our race
are coming uninvited and without asking for
any such concessions was ingloriously dodged.
On military subjects the platform is
vague in some respects, engagingly frank
in others. It is allowed that there must be
“adequate home defence against foreign
aggression, but what is meant by
‘ adequate” is left to the imagination, nor fs
it stated, whether Australia is to co-operate
with Britain and the other Dominions or
play a lone hand. Submarines and
“adequate” above-water craft are, however,
proposed; also “air forces, depdts, etc.,” and
“land forces, fortifications, etc.,” and mines.
And in order that the land forces may be
as efficient or as inefficient as possible, the
Defence Act and the Constitution are to he
amended as follows :
Deletion of all clauses relating to compulsory
training and service.
Abolition of trial by court-martial where civil
courts are available. Any sentence imposed by court-
martial to be subject to review by a civil court.
No penalties to be imposed except in pursuance
of explicit enactment.
Intended regulations to be publicly advertised,
and regulations to have no effect till before both
Houses, either of which may veto.
Limitation of professional soldiers to necessary
instruction and administration and working staff.
Abolition of military oaths.
And by way of a final Kerensky touch: —
Abolition of distinction between commissioned and
non-commissioned officers.
Recognition of the principle of election of quali-
fied candidates as officers.
Salutes and other useless discipline to be abolished.
There is to be “no employment of or inter-
ference by soldiers in industrial disputes,”
and there is to be “punishment of Minis-
ters and other persons for breach of this
provision.” Presumably the punishment
will be specially drastic if Ministers try
to prevent a Government railway or line
of steamers being seized by a body of revolu-
tionaries in accordance with the “take and
hold” doctrine adopted by the Trade Union
Congress in 1921. Citizens on completion
of training are “to retain arms delivered to
them during training”-—this to enable the
revolutionaries aforesaid to be trained and
armed for the take-and-hold campaign,
while the Government will be gaoled if it
resists. “No Australian is to be conscripted
for military service overseas,” not even in
Maoriland should that country be attacked
as a jumping-off point for an invasion of
Australia. A force thus constituted, in-
spired, trained and officered would doubt-
less be serviceable to Socialism of the revolu-
tionary sort, but a foreign foe who meant
business would find it easy. As Kitchener
said of another improvisation, it wouldn’t
keep out the Salvation Army.
THE SMALL TOWNS.
When Julius Cassar began to develop a
policy for the Roman Empire on a grand
scale, the chief thing that was wrong with
the Italian peninsula was the loss of rural
population. The freemen were gradually
fading away, crowding into the overgrown
cities or seeking adventure in distant lands
which had come under Roman dominion.
Though (Aesar himself attempted something,
it was left for Augustus to restore the bal-
ance of town and country life; and it is
probable that the main explanation of the
success of the early Roman emperors was
that the basis of Italian national life was
sounder under their rule than it had been
during the last century of republican govern-
ment. The reasons for the desertion of the
farms and villages before the time of Augus-
tus were very similar to those which operate
now. The growth of luxury had been great;
the shows of the city were many and of bar-
baric splendor; the money-lender was very
busy and his usury soon forced the farmer
who lived beyond his means to sell out. In
addition there had been many proscriptions,
which included the small men as well as the
big; for each small man followed the politi-
cal faction of his richer patrons. Virgil
himself had been a victim of such proscrip-
tion until his farm was restored by Augus-
tus. The re-establishment of a reasonable
balance of town and country life gave the
State a new start which enabled it to resist
all the disintegrating influences within and
without for four centuries; and it is reason-
able to suppose from the historical evidence
that such a balance is the most essential
thing for the permanence of any community.
Certain it is that the States like Carthage
and Palmyra which were merely trading
centres and clearing houses on a large scale
had a very brief period of real wealth and
success. National life is rooted in the soil;
and where there is not enough soil it can
never be made up for by an increased quan-
tity of bricks and mortar.
* * * *
The desertion of the rural districts is more
or less a feature of every white man’s coun-
try to-day. It has been partly caused by
the decay of village life. That decay began
with the growth of railways and has been
more and more evident since the coming of
motor traffic. ' The minor industries which
kept the village alive are no longer needed.
The country blacksmith depended largely
upon the horses he shod; the coach-builder
found enough repair work in a small district
to keep him going; the saddler and harness-
maker had a shop next door. There was a
general store, because in the days of horse
traffic goods could not be conveniently carried
far in small quantities; and the people who
ran all these little concerns, together with
the local farmers, were sufficient to keep a
baker, a tailor, a dressmaker and possibly a
carpenter. These, with the local publican,
made the village. Life there was dull,
but, as a rule, wholesome; and most villages
dreamt of ultimately becoming important
towns.. A few of them have realised their
dream, but most are being wiped out. The
motor-car does not cast a shoe, does not seek
village repairs, does not even pause for a
drink, but whirls by in a cloud of dust to
some larger place where petrol is stored and
there are picture-shows and possibilities of
listening-in. This accounts for some of the
falling off of rural population, but not for
all, nor even for the larger part. The main
cause is the attraction of city life itself, the
determination to lead a more exciting, easier
and cleaner-handed existence than is possible
on the farm. Though the city excitements
are cheap and dearly purchased at the price
of the rugged independence of the man on
the land, they look attractive enough to one
who has endured the monotony of bad sea-
sons and the bitterness, of small returns. No
doubt there are some better reasons than
these. The educational advantages of the
city are great; and there is also the consider-
ation of the doctor and the hospital. But
whatever the causes operating, the unpleas-
ant fact remains that the drift to the city
is steady and continuous and that, though
here and there we may find a politician ready
to talk about it, as W. M. Hughes did in
Sydney last week, no serious effort has been
made to arrest it.
* * * * -
It seems improvable that the smaller vil-
lage in its old shape will ever be restored.
There is no likelihood of the motor-car dying
a natural death, but there is a possibility of
the aeroplane creating a new kind of village.
The power of cutting down distance irre-
spective of roads is very likely to cause places
of amusement to spring up at spots where
there are good landings and which are central
to a district of 10,000 square miles or so.
Such villages, however, would do little to
restore the balance of rural population,
though they might assist in making the most
lonely farm or station a more attractive place
to live in. A more important aspect of the
question is the position of the smaller towns
which have succeeded in passing the village
stage and are not likely to be destroyed
utterly by motor traffic. Many of these have
shown considerable life in organising carni-
vals to advertise their existence; and re-
cently the competition among them for the
establishment of big industrial works, like
the Ford concern, has shown a possible road
to a form of decentralisation which is every
way worth while. The main efforts towards
decentralisation —however long politicians
contrive to shirk the issue—must in the end
take the form of opening a larger number of
deep-sea ports; but the creation of large in-
land towns would go some distance towards
solving the most acute of our national pro-
blems. _ Each such town with a genuine
industrial life of its own woull require a
surrounding area of cultivated land to sup-
port it; and the small mixed farmers of such
an area might easily combine all the advan-
tages of rural and town life. An increase
in the power of local expression might help
to bring this about. Already the local govern-
ing and other bodies possess some enthusi-
asm ; but to spasmodically beg for the
patronage of the promoters of large indus-
trial concerns is not enough. With greater
powers of local expression and of local gov-
ernment such concerns might originate in
the districts themselves and pride of industry
might become the keynote of a stronger citi-
zen life. The States are artificial divisions,
but the small towns—which aspire to be big
towns —are real centres called into existence
by the real conditions which surround them.
To foster all such realities should be the
settled Australian policy.
A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY.
Dropping into Rockhampton after a year's
absence, a new notice-board caught my idle
eye outside that ornate Customs House
which broods over days of pre-Federation
glory. It was inscribed “Commonwealth
Health Laboratory,” and as no dragons
barred the path I wandered in to see what
it was all about. The old bonded store at
the back of the Customs House looked
strangely young in clean brickwork and
fresh paint, new windows glittered in its
walls, and a hum like that of a separator
came from within. Where in ancient days
the chief Customs serang was wont to hand
over his high-stepping horse to a bowing
myrmidon was a concrete yard with many
guinea-pigs behind wire-netting, and some
supercilious-looking rabbits. A young man
in a long white coat came across the grass
plot, and I explained myself to him as an
Australian who would like to know what
a Commonwealth Health Laboratory was,
and why. No, I wasn’t a doctor, but one
wlio’d seen a lot of tropical lands, and had
even shared some of their less disreputable
diseases. Yes, I’d had malaria —all three kinds
of it, and two of them at once. First ex-
perience of malaria was in North Queens-
land. He grinned. “Mine, too,” quoth he.
“Come in. I want to ask you some ques-
tions.”
We passed in to a spacious place which
gave the same impression of undefilable
cleanliness as does the starched presence of
an efficient hospital matron. A faint odor
of chemicals hung in the air, and the hum-
ming noise was louder. “Centrifuge,” said
the young man. “Whirls out the germs.
That? Incubator. Keeps the germs we
w'ant to grow. That little gadget automati-
cally regulates the temperature. That oven
affair is for blood specimens we want to
test for syphilis—Wassermann test. There’s
our media-making room. The germs we want
to cultivate live on broth or jelly in test-
tubes with a plug of sterilised cotton-wool
in the mouth to keep the air-germs out.
There’s a spare lab. room for the hookworm
men, or for any special work. Yes, doctors
can come here and work, if they observe
some simple conditions, and pay for the
material they use. We opened this little
show in April—any amount of work ever
since. Now I want some information about
the North.”
He got it —all I had. It was like a cross-
examination by a lawyer, and I felt that I
hadn’t got a secret left in my physical life.
Then he admitted casually that he had been
over a large part of the North himself, look-
ing for malaria for the information of the
Tropical Institute at Townsville. He had
found his malaria, too —it found him, lie
said. “Did it ever strike you what a dif-
ferent sort of country the North would be
if we had malaria on the usual tropical
lines? Pasty, pot-bellied children ; haggard,
weary mothers; everyone going down and
out every now and then with fever?” It
never had, and it was a subject to ponder
over.
I came in again. Also I hunted up in-
formation about Commonwealth Health
Laboratories, principally from a little
yellow-covered magazine called Health.
issued by the Commonwealth Department
of Health. The Rockhampton lab. is one
of seven, the others being at Townsville,
Rabaul. Toowoomba, Lismore, Bendigo and
Port Pirie. Another will be open soon at
Kalgoorlie. Each is a fully-equipped modern
laboratory, with a specially-trained medical
officer to run it, and a trained assistant to
help him. They are operated by the Common-
wealth Department of Health through its divi-
sional offices —my Rockhampton discovery,
for instance, gets its supplies and general
working directions from the Commonwealth
Health Office in Brisbane. If any of them
wants special assistance in any kind of
laboratory work the officer can get it from
the big Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in
Melbourne. If he wants help in matters of
tropical disease, he can get it from the In-
stitute of Tropical Medicine in Townsville.
The Serum Laboratories and the Tropical
Institute are both run by the Department,
so there is a constant interchange of infor-
mation, and the medical officers in the more
remote laboratories are able to keep up
with scientific progress. There seems to
be an inexplicable absence of red tape about
it all.
Their plan of work is equally definite.
The first job is that of examining speci-
mens for the local doctors. The modern
doctor can no more give his patients the full
benefits of modern medicine and surgery
without the help of a laboratory than an
aviator can drop bombs on an enemy with-
out an aeroplane and all that stands behind
it. Without it he can never be really sure
that a particular kind of sore throat is not
diphtheria, or that a woman’s swollen
breast is not cancer. The laboratories
are in places where they can be reached
easily by rail and mail —Rockhampton is at
the junction of the Northern railway with
the 500-mile spur that stretches out to
Blackall and Longreacli. If a doctor out
there wants a specimen examined all he
has to do is to send it along, and in a day
or two he will get a reply by letter or tele-
gram. If it is a case from a public hospi-
tal it costs nothing. If it is a private case
a moderate fee is charged, on a fixed
schedule, of which a copy is sent to every
doctor in the district.
The next job is public-health examination
work, such as that required by a medical
officer of health who finds a suspected
case of diphtheria or typhoid. He
wants to know for certain, so that steps
may be taken to protect others. If it is
already spreading the doctor wants the
laboratory more than ever. The water-
supply or the milk-supply may ho suspect
—only the laboratory can tell whether tlm
suspicion is well founded or not. Queens-
land has good reason to recollect its plague
experiences, and rats found dead, especi-
ally about a seaport, need to be examined
in case they have died of plague. Only the
laboratory can make quite sure. When
patients have become convalescent from diph-
theria or typhoid, they may still be carry-


mg _ germs—again the laboratory. The diag-
nosis of certain cases of syphilis can ouly
be surely made in a laboratory. The same
holds with hookworm and filaria. Malaria
diagnosis is another laboratory job. Any
special diseases which prevail in the neigh-
borhood get particular attention. At Ben-
digo and Ivalgoorlie, for instance, powerful
X-ray plants are installed for the early diag-
nosis and study of miner’s phthisis.
Over and above these the health labora-
tories carry out a lot of other useful duties.
If mosquitoes are a nuisance or a source
of danger, the laboratory is ready to give
a hand by finding out breeding-places and
species, and advising how they can be best
dealt with. The Rabaul laboratory has
solved the whole question of malaria-pre-
vention in that town. Before it was started
nobody had even identified the species of
mosquito which was causing the trouble,
and nobody knew where it was breeding.
As they get specimens from all over big
tracts of country the laboratories are in the
best possible position to get—and to give
to the local health authorities —early infor-
mation of any commencing or developing
epidemic. They keep touch with the hospi-
tals and help with advice on pathology. In
the tropics they keep tab on malaria, filaria
and other tropical diseases. Also, each of
them is a depQt for supply of the various
vaccines and serums manufactured at the
Commoi)wealth Serum Laboratories, and they
always nave on hand stocks of such essen-
tial things as fresh antitoxin for diphtheria.
In the days of not so long ago many a poor
kid with diphtheria got a rough spin from
being filled with imported antitoxin that
might have been on a chemist’s shelves for
years.
Why doesn’t Australia advertise things
like this a bit more? If America started
anything of the kind it would never be off
the movies or the cables, as another illus-
tration of American superiority. I confess
that my only recollections of a Common-
wealth Health Department had to do with
having to get up at an ungodly hour on
board ship, and being looked over by a doctor.
I asked my Australian doctor-scientist.
“Don’t know,” he said. “Anyhow, we don’t
talk much about ourselves in the Depart-
ment. Hard enough to get through the
work without having to make up bouquets
to throw at ourselves.”
I’m not throwing any bouquets. I’m just
telling of something which surprised me.
For, after all, if you went looking for evi-
dence of an honest desire and definite pur-
pose to help Australia, about the very last
place you would think of looking into would
be the old bonded store at the hack of the
Rockhampton Customs House.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Can Arbitration Awards Be Enforced?
In those early ’nineties when “the war
against strikes” was begun in Australia, the
great difficulty in the way of compulsory
arbitration was foreseen. How were a thou-
sand or two men who disapproved of an
award to be compelled to obey it?
Rarely had the union concerned any money
that might be forfeited ; and imprisonment of
a thousand members was out of the question.
Faced with this difficulty the N. S. Wales
Parliament, which pioneered this class of
legislation in Australia, was driven back
upon Conciliation—it decided to see whether
it was not possible to arrange settlements of
which both parties approved. The method
was so little of a success that Arbitration
was again pushed to the front, and one after
another Parliaments turned their blind eye to
the great flaw in the scheme—the apparent im-
possibility of getting large bodies of men to
honor distasteful awards or orders of the
Courts. For years we just muddled through ;
again and again the weakness in our plans
for “the peaceful settlement of industrial dis-
putes” was exposed, but we put up with it
because, though often they failed, they some-
times succeeded. The position has, however,
grown steadily worse as the unions have
fallen more and more under the domination
of irreconcilables whose avowed purpose in
many cases is to defeat Arbitration. The
outcome is utterly unfair both to the em-
ployer and to the third party in every dis-
pute, the general public; for the employer is
within easy reach of the law if he breaks an
award or an order, while the general public
has to bear the expense of the machinery of
Arbitration while denied its benefits. In the
circumstances it is not astonishing that there
should be a clamor for the entire sweeping
away of a law which is so one-sided in its
operation. But before the community can
agree to anything of that sort a much more
resolute effort must be made to discover a
means of remedying the one great defect in
the machineryfor, after all," it is no more
than a defect in the machinery—the prin-
ciple is as sound as ever it was. What has
to be discovered is some form of security
which the unions can put up. A money
guarantee might serve if it could be got; but
it might not be available when it was most
wanted; and, anyhow, the bond would pro-
bably not be very effective —the interest of
each member in it would be too small. A
better plan might be to require three bonds-
mQi—the president and secretary of the
union and one member of Parliament: the
president and secretary of the union con-
cerned for certain; the other might be in-
cluded with advantages though whether every
union could secure a Parliamentary bonds-
man is doubtful, and it might be unfair
to deny a union an award for failure to
secure a bond which it could not command.
The bond in any case should not involve
the risk of forfeiture of money; not directly,
at any rate. It should simply mean that,
in the event of a union failing to obey an
order of the Court, its secretary and presi-
dent would automatically cease to be sec-
retary and president, and would be disquali-
fied from holding any office in that or any
other union for a period of three years. If
it is practicable to make an M.P. a bonds-
man to require a Parliamentary bondsman
—he should m the same circumstances lose
his seat, and be also disqualified from sitting
or being elected for three years. And of
course it should be a punishable offence for
any union to pay money to any disqualified
person or for any disqualified person to
accept money or other payment from a union
during his period of disqualification. This
would probably have a much larger effect
than either threats of de-registration or
actual de-registration. It would at least tend
to make the two most influential men in the
union determined advocates of ! obedience to
the law. If they are not such advocates they
have no right to be officers of a body enjoy-
ing great benefits from and under the law;
and the law will be only protecting itself
by removing them. If, on the other hand,
their union disobeys an award in' spite of
their advice and entreaties, then the law
will do no unjust thing when it removes
them from the head of a body they
have failed to lead into law-abiding paths.

Theodore’s New State.
Premier Theodore, of Queensland, has come
out with a proposal that all Northern West-
ralia and the Northern Territory above lat.
20 should be formed into a new State, with
a Provisional Government to run it until it
is ready for a Parliament. Such new State
would have an area of 400,000 square miles,
and its projector suggests a Commonwealth
loan of £20,000,000 to “develop and populate” it,
the development to comprise a railway from
Derby (W.A.) to Camooweal (Q.), several
branch lines, and modern harbors at Derby,
Wyndham and the mouths of the Victoria
and the Macarthur rivers. It is not on record
that Mr. Theodore has ever seen the region,
but he is confident as to its suitability for
sheep, cattle, dairying, cotton and general
agriculture; and he might have added that
his Government thought so highly of the
iron-ore deposits at Yampi Sound that it
paid some thousands for options when it
planned to establish steelworks at Bowen.
There is no mention of the North-South
railway in the programme of development. If
the idea is to deprive South Australia of this
national work by extending the Derby-
Camooweal proposal south through Queens-
land it won’t do at all. The Labor Premier
may be innocent of any such notion, but in
view of his past suggestions that the agree-
ment with the central State should be de-
parted from the South Australians have a
right to feel suspicious. The political future
of the N.T. between the 20th parallel and
the S.A. border is another point on which
information is lacking, nor does Mr. Theo-
dore give reasons for his belief —if it be his
belief —that 400,000 square miles of territory
with 10,000 white inhabitants or less can be
transformed by an expenditure of £20,000,000
into “a well developed, well populated, pro-
gressive and prosperous State.” It has cost
more than £20,000,000 —£620,000 more on
June 20 —to resume land and build rail-
ways for the soldier-settlement scheme, with
its tragically large percentage of failures,
and £14,442,000 has been advanced besides.
Perhaps if the author of the scheme
travelled across his new State, start-
ing from the Barkly Tableland and
visiting Darwin, the Katherine, Wyndham,
Yampi Sound, Broome (which he seems
to have left out of his calculations) and
Napier Broome Bay (of which the R.A.N.
thinks so highly and where a Scottish syndi-
cate is after a big concession), he would
modify his proposals or suggest alternatives.
And the Commonwealth Government might
do worse than offer him the opportunity to
acquire this first-hand information, seeing
that he is likely to be disengaged for six
months. It is something new for an Austra-
lian politician to try his hand on a construc-
tive policy for the neglected parts of the
Commonwealth, instead of dividing his
thoughts between the selection-ballot and the
races, and the innovation should be en-
couraged.
♦
Are We Downhearted?
By one who thinks we needn’t be:—
The faults and shortcomings of humanity are
not to-day hid under a bushel. The jeremiad is the
vogue. Indeed, it may be some subtle psychological
reaction from the prevailing note of pessimism which
renders that curious salutation, “Cheerio!” the most
popular of modern English farewells. Anyone so
disposed may daily read, or hear, some dissertation
upon the stodgy futility of the churches, the appalling
lack of home-life, the vanity, extravagance and vul-
garity of the women, and so forth. The list, which
is familiar to everybody, can be—and generally is—
extended till all is blue. Given one of its doleful
items, the rest must, follow as the night, the day.
These cold blasts of criticism have the inevitable
effect of making people wonder if a great deal of
this invective is not mere conventional claptrap.
Or if, at all events, it is not being considerably
overdone. Nagging, as a means of intensive culture,
is understood to be out of date. Schoolmasters have
arrived at the sane conclusion that to overlook, as
far as possible, the glaring, sunflowerlike failings of
a child, and concentrate upon its recessive, modest-
violet virtues, is the way to evolve healthy self-respect.
May not the same method be beneficial to children
of a larger growth? Give a dog a bad name, and
no fortune-teller is required to forecast his fate.
Human beings are apt, the world over, to resemble
each other. “We fancy men are individuals,” says
Emerson. “So are pumpkins; but every pumpkin
in the field goes through every point of pumpkin
history.” The term “race” is only a convenient
appellation for a number of men and women. Not
being marooned on tropic isles, we all have re-
curring opportunities of appraising our fellow-crea-
tures. And can you not, even yet, instantly recall a
young girl who is a gentlewoman, some youth
who is both steady and industrious, and some home
to the stability of which affection has contributed as
obviously as the architect? If, “in a contemplative
fashion, and a tranquil frame of mind,” we survey our
immediate circle of acquaintances, it is probable we
shall subscribe to Disraeli’s famous, if somewhat
hasty, resume of the then brand-new Darwinian
theory and declare for the angel as opposed to the ape.
These, however, are naturally private sources of
reassurance. Here, then are three instances, taken
from press-cuttings, which throw a strong spotlight
on the characters of a man, woman and child, the
respective units of our race. The first incident
occurred at a suburban station, and this version is
condensed from the newspaper report:—
Numbers of passengers who had alighted from a
down train were horrified by the sight of a young
woman stretched at full length across the uptrack.
Attempting to cross the rails, encumbered with
many parcels, her foot slipped and she had fallen
on the line. At that moment an up-train rusheel
swiftly round a curve in the line, and bore down
on her. The motorman threw on his brakes hard,
but the momentum was too great. The bystanders
expected to see the girl killed, but at the last moment
a young man rushed forward and dragged her into
safety.
Not a long story, but one fraught with some issues.
A man here risked life and limb for a woman he
had never seen before, and was never likely to see
again.
The narrative of a woman’s swift and magnificent
decision reached here in an English cable:—
Mrs. Sarah Smith was carrying a child in a street
at Hull when the brakes of a farmer’s motor-car
failed. The driver shouted a warning, and the
mother, realising the danger, faced the car with her
back to a wall, holding the baby over her head.
The car crashed into the mother’s body and head,
and she was crushed to death, but the baby was
saved.
Finally the case of a little girl, which was sub-
sequently brought under the notice of the Royal
Humane Society. The family dwelling caught fire,
in the absence of the parents. Twin children of
two were imprisoned in the burning buliding. Irene,
the elder sister, plunged into this furnace and suc-
ceeded in bringing one child out. As she rushed
back for the second one, a quantity of blazing stuff
descended upon her, and she was herself badly
burned. In spite of which “she successfully carried
her living burden to safety.” Irene was 10 years
old —an age at which many contemporaries are still
playing with their dolls.
These three, apparently quite ordinary people, even
in this melancholy, berated, post-war period, could
rise to an occasion, with an absolute disregard of
self. Not “saints with soup-plate haloes” either;
but precisely the sort of persons we pass every day
in the street. Nor are .these isolated instances. A
similar collection might be made any month in the
year.
It is highly probable that not a little of this so
prevalent despair of humanity arises from hasty
generalisation. A sermon, preached not long
before the war, made the listeners feel that the
young men of Australia must certainly be briskly
engaged in town-planning a future Sodom or
Gomorrah. Yet only a few weeks later the whole
world was thrilled by the miracle of the Gallipoli
landing. George Meredith says philosophy bids
us see we are not so pretty as rose-pink, and not
so repulsive as dirty drab. Rose is the color of hope,
anyway, and transparent; opaque drab is like a pall.
“Upon my word,” wrote R.6;5., “we are a brave,
cheery crew, we human beings, and my admiration
increases daily—primarily for myself, but by a
roundabout process for the whole crowd ; for I dare
say they all have their poor little secrets and
anxieties.” That, surely, is the trumpet note we
need to hear to-day, rather than all this canting
whine of disillusion.
Felt Hats from Italy.
The Tariff Board was told the other day by
a Victorian manufacturer that 50 p.c. of the
plant in the Melbourne felt-hat mills, in
which £500.000 has been invested, was idle
for want of orders. The secretary of the
trade union stated that not one of his mem-
bers, 1000 in all, was “working much more
than half-time.” Facts equally discouraging
were presented on behalf of the Sydney
branch of the industry when the Board was
taking evidence in N. S. Wales. Yet the
Commonwealth’s requirements in felt hats
could be fully supplied by the Australian fac-
tories, and were so supplied (military de-
mands also) during the war. It is the old
story of an inadequate tariff and an unin-
structed public opinion. Although the Aus-
tralian article is of good quality and is re-
tailed at a moderate price (an importer in-
formed the Board that the dearest Austra-
lian fur-felt hat in the shops is £1 cheaper
than the cheapest Stetson), the manufac-
turers are fighting a losing battle in their
own market. In one year imports of foreign-
made felt hats jumped from 16,537 dozen,
valued at £145,652, to 38,336 dozen, valued
at £293,852. Italy alone increased its con-
signments from 5562 dozen fur-felt hats,
valued at £41,364, to 11,801 dozen, valued
at £87,272. Wages are much lower in Italy
than in Australia, and hours of labor are
longer, while dyes, hatbands, bindings and
the like cost considerably less. Because
of these advantages the Italians are increas-
ingly formidable competitors of the Austra-
lian manufacturer in his own Commonwealth,
although the fur in their felt hats is of Aus-
tralian origin (it practically all comes from
the Australian rabbit), and although this
country is supposed to have a Protective
tariff. They have got such a footing in the
Australian market that they are in a posi-
tion to sell some lines at a minimum of profit,
or even at a loss, knowing that if local fac-
tories are starved out they will be able to
recover their losses with interest. And they
are aided in their designs by soulless im-
porters, unpatriotic shopkeepers and irra-
tional purchasers who swallow the yarn of
the bad Australian behind the counter, if not
bad Australians themselves. Nobody can
blame the Italians for trying to get all the
trade they can, but to send £IOO,OOO p.a. or
more to Mussolini’s country for hats made
of Australian rabbit-fur when hats as good
or better, the produce of our own factories,
can be obtained for a very moderate outlay
is a reflection on this nation’s sanity. The
tariff on wool-felt hats is 15s. per dozen Brit-
ish and 255. per dozen foreign; on fur-felt
hats 245. per dozen British (or 35 p.c.) and
365. per dozen foreign, (or 45 p.c.). Obviously
the duties are too low and will have to be sub-
stantially increased. Nevertheless, the state
of Australian industry is such that no tariff,
short of prohibition, can be effective unless
it is accompanied by a general policy of pre-
ference to worth-while Australian articles
offered at a fair price. That goes for indi-
viduals, associations, local bodies and Gov-
ernments, Commonwealth and State, and
applies to all manner of Australian products,
including hats.

What J. Bull Doesn’t Know About
Australia.
James Barrett, a well-known encycloptedic
doctor of Melbourne, lately made his con-
tribution in the United Empire to the en-
lightenment of Father Bull as to tropical
Australia and the future thereof. He put
his case in three propositions:—
Tropical Australia is a mighty good land for the
white man, also the white woman and the white baby.
What it wants is removal from direct political con-
tiol, and administration by a Commission or by chart-
ered companies.
And it also wants some form of freehold tenure,
the leasehold arrangement being a freak and a failure.
About the first assertion there is no shadow
of doubt. The Australian who takes the
trouble to know the subject at all is unani-
mous that the North is a white man’s land,
and he is the only person in the wide world
whose opinion on the matter is worth much,
because he possesses the only big stretch of
tropical country in which, through scarcity
of the cheap nigger, white men set out to
do their own hard work at the beginning of
things, and found that they could do it with-
out loss of health, comfort or dignity. The birth
and death statistics even suggest that the
North is a better land than the South. But
the splendid gifts of Nature are practically
the only ones Tropical Australia ever re-
ceived. The most fortunate part of that
region is about 400 miles from the seat of
its particular Government by the best avail-
able route, and quite ordinary parts are 2000
miles away, and till a beginning is made at
the breaking-up of the big States this mon-
strous absentee system will continue. Some
of the absentees are even greater fools than
they need be. In 785,000 square and very
empty miles of the great North, old Govern-
ments of cranky theorists decreed that no
land should be given away or sold to set-
tlers. Now the settler, especially the small
one, has a love for the freehold which can
no more be eradicated by argument than the
poisonous teachings of Karl Marx can eradi-
cate love of country. The Irish variety will
fight an empire for an acre of it.
The land-sale policy (with the neces-
sary precautions against excessive hold-
ings) has at least the advantage that
a holding can’t be totally abandoned
without someone, whether the original owner
or his successor, leaving behind him a certain
amount of capital, and his dislike for doing
any such thing helps to make population per-
manent. In this respect the leasehold fails.
Statistics have an aggravating habit of being
too far behind, and those for land settlement
are only up to 1922. For the two States
with the pure leasehold theory the figures
are remarkable so far as they go :
Queensland.
Land Alienated Held under Unoccupied
or in Process Lease or except by
of Alienation License the Crown
(Acres). (Acres). (Acres).
1920. .25,681,580 325,853,774 77,584,646

Northern Territory.
1920.. 476,556 143,274,151 191,366,093
1922.. 476,556 134,488,526 200,151,718
The net result is that in the two leasehold
divisions of the Commonwealth the area occu-
pied by nobody save the Crown increased by
32,276,437 acres, while in the five States
where freehold is permitted the Crown area
diminished by 1(1,751,719 acres. The Crown
is a respectable tenant, but it pays neither
rent nor taxes, and it grows neither wheat
nor wool, and it often destroys neither rab-
bits nor thistlesso the fact that it is coming
into its own again in Queensland and the
Northern Territory is not satisfactory. So
the doctor’s third proposition appears as
sound as the first one. But the idea about re-
moving the tropic belt from “direct political
control” and so on is silly frill and meaning-
less guff. Indirect political control is only
the control that already exists filtered
through an extra set of place-holders; and
there is no such thing as government by com-
panies, unless the companies have the right
to make their own laws, nigger-labor laws in
particular. If British public opinion is to
have any good influence on Australia, as
people like Dr. Barrett appear to think pos-
sible, it should be instructed that the urgent
requirements of the North are (1) as much
self-government of the plain familiar State
variety as the present population admits of;
(2) the freehold system, to attract a more
settled population than cane-cutting nomads;
(3) a real transcontinental railway (one is
enough to begin with), such as the United
States opened in 1869, and Canada in 1886,
to bring population, so that there may be
more self-government. To which it might be
added that a conspicuous present obstacle to
progress is a Frime Minister who is too un-
enterprising to re-establish the freehold sys-
tem in the Territory though he believes in it;
whose idea of the pace of a relief expedition
is one mile per day ; who is capable of spend-
ing weeks thinking how to rescue a batch of
marooned holiday girls from a handy island;
and whose lack of the pioneering instinct
suggests that he was meant to be a useful
and conscientious mayor in a crowded local-
ity. With these facts before him, J. Bull
might begin to get a grip of Australia’s bis
problem.

Harvest Home.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Chicago wheat pit to-day was a scene of
squirming, shouting, gesticulating Bedlam.” — Cable.
A spoken word, a thrill of distant wire,
A sudden babel of a thousand tongues!
The fingers clutch, the eyes take sullen fire,
Fat voices toil to speech from heaving
lungs.
Coats are flung off, sleeves rolled, the fight
begins;
And there are fortunes for the man who wins.
Hunger has wrought to fury in grey lands.
Where revolution, grown too mad to think,
Has rushed upon a nation with red hands
And given earth her noblest blood to drink;
But here each frenzied throat that bursts a
collar
Buys up prospective hunger at per dollar.
Upon the breadline in the northern cold
Men shiver on their pinched and frozen
feet,
But in the wheat-pit there is trampled gold
And that is wasted which no man may eat.
For there men play amid the heat and noise
With Famine and pale Want as fortune’s
toys.
Somewhere the gods of harvest sit and weep
For olden joys upon a happier soil,
Where reap-hooks flashed the yellow bread to
reap
That Nature yielded as a gracious spoil;
They sang the harvest home in that gay
strain
Whose lingering echoes in all hearts remain.
But now, forlorn of melody and wit,
The grain is hustled to the waiting truck;
And gross “bears” grappling in a roaring pit
Trust to their paws and lungs for harvest
luck.
Which shows the distant reader at a glance
The scope and magnitude of man’s advance!

line from Darwin to Borroloola, 700 miles.
For the whole distance there is no Govern-
ment depot where supplies can be got by
the natives other than the Government
cattle-station at Oenpelli, on the Alligator
River. Here, however, there are few natives
that ever require rations, as the district
abounds in game and fish, with other
native foods in abundance. Arnhem Land
also has a good supply for the greater part
of the year. But at certain times the
natives of Coburg Peninsula, particularly
the older members, have to scratch hard to
keep a bit of kidney fat stowed away inside.
These old people, being unable to travel,
would have a very rough time of it if it
were not for the flour they get from a couple
of friendly trepangers on the coast. Within
the last couple of months Jimcrow, the
last of the aborigines who remembered the
British settlement at Raffles Bay, died at
the camp of one of these men. To my
knowledge Jimcrow (so named by the
redcoats) has been a pensioner of a tre-
panger for several years. Frequent appeals
for supplies for these old folk have been
fruitful of a fine crop of promises, but the
only thing that has eventuated has been
the issue of three Government blankets on
one occasion, and another time a couple of
501 b. bags of flour were sent along. These
items were only supplied on the white man
agreeing to transport the stuff free in the
cutter in which he takes out his own annual
supplies. I know there are mission stations
along the coast, but with the exception of
the C. of E. Mission at Groote Island rations
are supplied only to the inmates of the mis-
sion or on the production of so much manual
labor by the recipient; and the old folk are
thus ruled out.

Britain and the Soviet.
All the news from Russia is of increasing
flurry and fluster in official Communist
circles. The new Government, which desires
to go back to the raw methods of 1918, is
haunted by internal and external ghosts, the
latter being mainly British. Perfidious
Albion, under the Baldwin restoration, is
accused, not only of refusing to lend 50
millions to the Soviet, but of making friend-
ships with border and non-Bolslievik States.
Both charges are probably true, but why tbe
ghost-haunted regime should fuss about them
is hard to see. Possibly it is just beginning
to realise the stupendous dimensions of its
failure to capture Great Britain, especially
England. The crash couldn’t be set down to
the Zinovieff letter, though there was much
fuss about that document, for propagandist
documents of the sort have been as common
as lunatics in Bedlam. It was simply that
■when Macdonald’s Laborism proved to be
Sovietism the Cold Country became aroused.
And the way it went to the poll, even more
than the state of parties after the poll,
showed how aroused it was. Majorities, of
10,000 and over are rare in the little British
constituencies, and at the 1923 election Eng-
land, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
produced only 10 of them. Seven were
scored by Laborites and three by Conserva-
tives. The biggest was a Labor majority of
13,697. In 1924 the aroused community went
to the poll with such vim that there were
no less than 48 majorities of over 10,000
votes, and of these 42 were Conservative
majorities. Five candidates of that party
scored the record majorities of 58,354,
32,990, 27,904, 25,315 and 25,006 respec-
tively. The party which founded the Man-
chester school of Freetraders, and which, less
than 20 years ago, had a majority of 356 in
the Commons over all other parties com-
bined, became a remnant, lurking to a great
extent among the outlying rocks and Celts of
Cornwall, Anglesey, the Hebrides and Shet-
land, where the hairy ponies grow. The
majority therefore probably represented the
return of England to the Protectionist faith
as well as an anti-Moscow revolt, for even
the Liberals’ belated renunciation of Bol-
shevism didn’t save them from disaster
while they adhered to Cobdenism, and while
there were Protectionists to be voted for.
The heroic downfall of the two parties which
showed traces of friendliness for the Soviet
must have convinced Moscow that it had
done much toil to small purpose; and now
panic or shell-shock seems to have seized its
bosses —they see a Baldwin conspiracy lurk-
ing behind every bush. Yet Baldwin has
certainly as much moral right to extend a
hand to democratic little republics like
Estlionia, Finland and Poland as Macdonald
had to take the bloodstained paw of the Mus-
covite monstrosity; and he has a much
greater numerical right. But that doesn’t
make the monstrosity any easier in what it
mistakes for its mind.
Miscegenation and Morocco.
Some of the disadvantages of mixing your
blood with your hereditary enemy are exem-
plified in the rcc.tnt doings in Spanish
Morocco, where the Moors have been stretch-
ing themselves again and feeling their
muscles. Their quarrel with Don
rado has lasted for upwards of 12 centuries,
but the fierceness of the squabble has not
prevented the two races mingling to such
a considerable extent that parts of Spain
have become almost as much African as
European and display various typically
Moorish traits. This has given their dusky
antagonists a big advantage in the argu-
ment. A fiery, fitful energy and a crazy
fanaticism distinguish the people of the
desert, whose history resembles more than
anything else the meteorological record of
a duststorm. Much has been made by Euro-
pean writers of Arab civilisation, but it
was a wild and whirling business, with the
constructive intentions of a willy-wah and
the civilising capacity of a cock-eyed bob.
It left no monument in human institutions,
and, though it picked up a few odds and
ends of Greek culture, as a whirlwind picks
up somebody’s hat in passing, it moved on
and left them lying somewhat battered about
the brim. Its science soon degenerated into
astrology, and its literature, where it was not
theological, was a matter of roses, perfumed
fountains and fat and unctuous houris, dis-
turbing to the senses but unsatisfying to
the mind. It could not even build a house
of its own. but delved excitedly amongst
the remains of Roman architecture for its
material. Its twisted columns and arches
turned sideways and upside-down express
its restless spirit but do not embody any
structural principle. It is possible that
THE CIVIC SPINNING-JENNY.
“The Sydney Municipal Labor policy includes the spending of £3,000,000 on new electrical works,
wholesale resumptions for alleged public purposes, and the purchase of a coal-mine.”
THE SHOWMAN: “Put your money on while she’s spinning, gents. You get all the prises.
We only get a hit of commission now and then.”
Spain in its great days, when it felt so
magnanimous that it refused to claim the
whole world but insisted on sharing it
equally with another European Power, could
have dealt with an insignificant onslaught
like the present one before breakfast; but
Spain’s great days appear to be over, not
because of economic or religious factors so
much as by racial deterioration. In her
days of power the land of bullfights claimed
a large proportion of Nordic blood, and even
after the Moorish admixture the northern
element remained relatively large. The best
blood of Spain was poured out on European
battlefields or was drained aw r ay in her
empire overseas. That empire eventually
struggled out of her relaxing grip; but it
has always remained in close association
with the mother country. It is to hold
intact the last link with her old dependen-
cies that Spain is struggling so fiercely to
retain her little remnant in Morocco, which
is as significant to her as the Suez Canal
is to tbe British E.mpire. Spanish Morocco
was to have been the terminus of a rail-
way that was to cross the African continent
to a point nearest to the Spanish republics
in South America. A grandiose scheme of
fast liners across the few hundred miles of
ocean separating the two continents sup-
plemented by a railway ferry across the
straits of Gibraltar was to bring Madrid
once more in close touch with her old pos-
sessions. Racial factors, however, are stub-
born things, and even this effort seems to
be too much for the debilitated giant. Her
failure is making France and Britain con-
sider the advisability of stepping in and
assuming control of the strip of territory
that remains to her before it slips out of
her nerveless hands.

bout S. Australia’s housing scheme :
The first homes erected under the S. Australian
Government's housing scheme (a thousand are to
be completed before the end of June) have got their
tenants. They are on the Mitcham foothills; here
a model township of five- an 1 six-roomed houses, in
14 designs, with a rule that no houses of similar
design shall adjoin, and on 50 x 150 lots on which
the fruit trees and vines of the old estate have been
preserved, has sprung up magically. Each occu-
pant will have to put up less than £1 per week
to pay the principal and interest in 42 years; and
a specially laudable feature of the scheme is the
preference given to applicants with families. No
would-be tenant with less than two children is given
a chance; 209 of the successful applicants have five
or more chifchrcn—one has 11 and two others 10
each. Altogetror, as far as cne can tell now, in
the 1000 new houses there will be 3500 children.
There seems to be a distinct possibility of the
scheme turning out that rare thing, a successful
Government venture. Whether success would have
been possible without the co-operation of Private
Enterprise is quite another matter. Contractor
Joseph Timms, who has had a lifetime of experi-
ence in these matters, undertook to do the work, in
the belief that mass production would help him
through, at £636 15s. per building. Heaven knows
what the sequel might have been had the Govern-
ment tried to do the building itself.

“Feng-Siiui” : Cabled reports of the com-
pletion of the long-deferred trial of EzUre,
modern Japanese pirate, inspire thoughts on
the character of Japanese judicial and other
psychology. Three years ago Ezure char-
tered a vessel and set out to sweep the seas.
He swept them of two Russian ships and
onte Chinese, whose crews he massacred to a
man. Returning home he divided his loot
with a syndicate of business men who had
supported . him financially, and he was
arrested with a famous geisha enjoying his
well-earned ease at a fashionable watering-
place. In his defence he pleaded that his
equilibrium had been upset by the thought
of the Nikolaevsk massacre, in which a
Japanese garrison, which had no business
there, was slaughtered by Russian irregu-
lars. The appeal was so popular that it has
taken two years to get a conviction. Simi-
lar examples were the sentences passed on
Captain Amakasu, who took the noted
socialist leader Osuoi, his wife and a small
child to a police-station, and there strangled
them ; also the murders during the earthquake
by soldiers, police and “vigilants” of several
hundred Koreans, and of large numbers of
Chinese mistaken for Koreans. In each case
the usual plea of over-heated patriotism re-
ceived sympathetic consideration. A one-sided
newspaper controversy raged round the
trials, and sentences of from six months to
three years were imposed, “the execution of
sentence being suspended.” It will be in-
teresting to see if the death-penalty demanded
by the Procurator for Ezure is carried out.

“Weaver” : Isn’t it time the Law began to
insist on accurate and less misleading
names for textile fabrics? The old decep-
tion of applying the term flannelette to a
loosely-woven cotton material with “agi,-.
tated” nap is still persisted in; and many
of the new names are quite as misleading.
For instance, fuji is tightly-twisted hard-
wearing silk cloth that is made from the
waste silk remaining after the reeling of
cocoons. But “fugee” and “fujee” are mer-
cerised cotton imitations of fuji. Tussor, or
tussore, is real silk, but strong and uneven
and fabricated from “wild” cocoons. “Tus-
sora” is just cotton, creamy-tinted. Crgpe
de Chine was once a delicate, filmy, “elastic”
silk cloth requiring special looms for its
manufacture. Now the name has been ap-
plied to most things short of a jute wool-
sack. In the knitted trade more especially,
fibre silk-—a highly lustrous imitation of the
real thing, at one-fifth the price—has come
into great vogue. It has certain merits, but
it isn’t silk. Australia’s biggest textile firm
spells this silk “sylk,” which is, all things
considered, a decent and candid differen-
tiation.
♦
“Jamwood” : Cases of anthrax due to in-
fected shaving-brushes keep cropping up. In
one reported to the Vic. Health Depart-
ment the other day the patient had used
a brush marked “British manufacture, guar-
anteed free from anthrax,” and bought at
a Melbourne auction-room. Whether the
deadly thing was really a British article, or
was made in Asia and fraudulently stamped,
remains to be proved. A Sydney man was
infected by a brush which also bore the
legend “British make, guaranteed free from
anthrax” —this label was printed on paper
and gummed on the box. Inquiry showed
that the brush had been bought at a subur-
ban fancy-goods shop; it was one of a lot
of six dozen obtained through a Sycfhey
agent from a Melbourne importing firm
specialising in cheap foreign goods. All
were similarly labelled and came out of the
same box, but the handles were of three dis-
tinct shapes. Two makes were pronounced
harmless, but washings from brushes iden-
tical with the one that had infected the
purchaser killed a guinea-pig. Since re-
cords began to be taken in 1920 about 50
Australians have contracted anthrax in this
way (in N. S. Wales alone there were 14
cases in one year and 11 in another), and
personally I have given up using brushes.
Very good shaving-creams are being made
in Australia, and a sufficient lather can be
worked up with the fingers. For those who
dislike the finger treatment there are germ-
proof rubber brushes, also made in Aus-
tralia.

“G. Whizz”: “G.D.M.” (B. l/l/’25) re-
marks that Japan and the Soviet are in joint
possession of Sakhalin. He is in error; the
brown man still holds the island. Likewise
he retains important fishing rights (won in
1905) which practically mean the domina-
tion of the Siberian coast. But the Japanese
are the last people on earth to be fitted for
the colonisation of Siberia. They are, per-
haps, the most tuberculous race on earth,
and their horror of fresh air is amazing to
one who notes their love of bathing. So
consistent has been their aversion for high
altitudes that, as “M.G.S.” states (B.
8/l/’25), Hokkiado, the northernmost
island of their own group, has been almost
left to the large crustaceans that are canned
there. The Tokio Government actually pro-
posed some time ago to bring Danish farmers
out to cultivate it. As for Sakhalin, they did
not even know that it was an island till one
Nevelskoy sailed all the way irom Kron-
stadt and charted it. When one considers
the large admixture of Malay blood in the
Japanese their failure as sub-Arctic colonisers
is not surprising. Down in tropical Hawaii
it is quite a different story.

POLITICAL
POINTS
There was a rush to man idle Australian
steamers last week, most of the seamen re-
cognising that the latest fool-strike, like its
forerunners, had only injured themselves,
their fellow-unionists and the general public.
In isolated cases there were mischievous in-
cidents for which the “talce-and-hold” gang
were responsible, and the danger of de-regis-
tration and cancellation of the Arbitration
award still hangs over the union. But, gen-
erally, the return to work is a welcome sign
that Communist influence is waning.
Though they may die hard and make a lot
of trouble while they are doing it, the Com-
munists are certainly losing ground at the
moment. Ryce and Houghton, Walsh’s
henchmen in Westralia, have been badly
beaten in an attempt to get on the Perth
A.L.P. executive. Smith, general secretary
of the Australian Railwaymen’s Union —the
same who went to Moscow early in the piece
—is resigning, and his retirement looks bad
for the newly-imported Chapman, whom he
worked into the secretaryship of the unfor-
tunate N.S.W. branch, and who straightway
suggested an irritation strike on approved
Moscow lines. Also, union after union is
seceding from the Communist-bossed Sydney
Trades and Labor Council. Equally signi-
ficant in its way is the statement of Hollo-
way, secretary of the Melbourne Trades and
Labor Council, that his body will co-operate
with the Prime Minister if the latter “makes
a genuine effort to bring our industrial laws
up to date.”
The demented Soviet, having failed to Bol-
shevise Britain, has now declared its pro-
ducts black. Having few factories of her
own, and what she has being in the unin-
structed hands of an unintelligent bureau-
cracy, the boycott is the nearest thing the
sprawling Republic can get to a protective
tariff. It is the same infantile expedient
China msed against Japan, Japan against
the United States, and Indian nationalism
against Britain. The net result is that the
boycotter pays higher prices for the same
commodities from other countries and loses
the boycotted country as a customer for
his own productions.
Soviet Russia and imperialist Japan have
signed an agreement which is evidently
Tokio’s reply to the U.S. naval manoeuvres
and the decision to go on with the Singapore
base. Whether those proceedings are moves
or counter-moves will be related in due
course. The Soviet account is that the agree-
ment is a step towards a Russian-Jap.-
German alliance against the British Empire
and the U.S.A. And that is precisely what
our imported trouble-makers, with their
poisonous “class-war” and their sullen hos-
tility to the White Australia policy, are
helping to bring about.
Irvi ne , C.J., of Vic., struck form at the
A. IS .A. fgte luncheon in Melbourne on Foun-
dation Day, and his speech—a hosanna for
\V bite Australia—put every other utterance in
the shade. Bruce contributed something that
might have been arresting on recasting the
Arbitration law, but it was. a prepared state-
ment which he read, ahd the effort was
“BACK TO WORK!”
feeble by comparison. Irvine’s scornful refer-
ences to constitutional upholstering, and hi.s
claim that the real framework of the State
rested upon fighting power, got a grip on
the gathering. His warning to place no de-
pendence upon any new spirit of universal
philanthropy in the world showed*.,that he
has no illusions aboiit the world’s <fnost ex-
pensive debating society. He ventured the
prophecy that J. Bull would not throw the
White Australia policy on the table for the
arbitrament of any international tribunal.
Once indulgently regarded as a whim, that
doctrine, he affirmed, was now regarded by
leaders of thought as the keystone of Im-
perial policy.
W. M. Hughes, ex-Freetrader and so many
other things, has discovered that there is
“a great and urgent need” for helping the
secondary industries, since “many of them
are in serious straits” and the tariff “no
longer serves.” It is a pity he didn’t make
the discovery seven months ago, when the
House was sitting and his mind was stored
with images of what the Fordney-McCumber
tariff had done for the IJ.S.A, Had he come
out strongly for tariff revision then he might
have got something done before Parliament
went into recess. Instead, he relapsed into
a sullen silence, broken only by querulous
criticism of the Government on small-beer
issues. This belated zealot for Protection is
unconvincing.
Although proportional representation
obtuins in N. S. Wales, and four of the five
North Shore seats are safe for the Fuller
Government, a body calling itself the North
Shore Electoral Council has had the effront-
ery to select five Nationalist candidates.
According to the S. M. Herald, “about 70
delegates were present” (there are nearly
70,000 names on the electoral roll), and 36
delegates or thereabouts selected Dr. Arthur,
M.L.A., A. E. Whatmore, E. S. Marks, E. E.
Salmon and W. H. Wood —the last was
Chief Secretary in the Wade Government.
Among the rejected were Burrows. Mayor of
Mosman; Samuels, Mayor of Manly; and A.
A. E. V. Reid, who represented the electorate
in the last Parliament and just missed in
1922. Presently, no doubt, the North Shore
Electoral Council will pile impertinence on
impertinence by telling the 70,000 electors
that they are to vote in a certain oi’der of
preference and no other. The Progressives
are honorably distinguished from the two
machine-ridden parties in that they neither
conduct pre-selection ballots nor discriminate
officially between one of their candidates
and another. It ought to be remembered to
their credit on election-day.
Eloquent evidence of what Protection will
do for an industry is supplied by American
dye-manufacturing concerns. When the
Great War broke out the industry in the
United States was so negligible that returns
did not even figure in the list of manufac-
tures. In 1916 the first of the duties on
imported dyes was instituted by Congress;
last year the value of the industry’s pro-
ducts amounted to £18,000,000; and impor-
tation of dyes from outside had practically
ceased. Australia had a similar opportu-
nity, but let it slip, and to-day almost every
ounce of dye used in the Commonwealth is
brought from overseas.
“Sandy Creek”; A mournful commentary
on the fatality of this blastiferous northern
climate is the report of the Statistician of
the Warwick (Darling Downs) district, who
has been percentaging the corpses of his Cali-
phate for 1924. This is what he makes of it.
In a total of ISO deaths, 27 per cent, had
passed the 70th post—7o to SO years, 12
males and 11 females; 80 to 00 years, 13
males and 8 females; 90 to 100 years, 5
males and 1 female. Top score, 96, was
credited to Roderick McLeod, of Terrica sta-
tion, a pallid infant who came to the Downs
in 1843, when he contracted the bad habit
of never sleeping outside if he could get
under a tree, and whose national anthem was
“Wool an’ ’ides an’ taller. Taller an’ ’ides
an’ wool.”
The Public Services of N. S. Wales missed
their opportunity the other day when a man
was brought in from another department to
take the second place in the gaol service,
with a view to giving him the first place very
soon. They made no protest whatever,
though this sort of thing is grossly unfair to
the men within the department concerned,
besides offering a premium for log-rolling and
wire-pulling. Now the Water and Sewerage
service is seething, word having been passed
round that a man from the Public Works
Department is likely to be given the job
of Chairman of the new Board —a position
for which there are said to be qualified men
within the present Board’s service. These
outside appointments nearly always have a
nasty smell, and few things are better cal-
culated to make the men in Government
employ cultivate political friendships and
trust to them rather than to hard work and
faithful service.
A £3,000,000 proposition :
Since Tammany regained control of municipal
Sydney the expected has been happening with a rush.
Under an arrangement made in 1922, the Council
gets electricity in bulk from the State Railway
Department and sells portion of the supply to 40
suburban municipalities. The contract is advantage-
ous to the Railway Commissioners, who are having
a hard job to make ends meet, and the Council has
found it uncommonly profitable—so much so that
it is in a position to either lower the cost to the
consumer or reduce the rates. But for reasons which
have been “explained” in a cloud of words by the
Lord Mayor, Paddy Stokes—being an ardent Socialist,
he is against Government control of electricity—the
Labor caucus has decided to cancel the arrangement
and build a £3,000,000 municipal power-station,
waste of capital and current being immaterial. This
policy was condemned in advance by an engineer
from Manchester, who was brought here expressly
to give the Council his advice, but it has the
enthusiastic support of Alderman Burke, who gets
part of his living by hanging round racecourses, and
who admits having had a friendly drink with a
capitalist just after the latter had insulted him, he
alleges, by suggesting a bribe. And in Sydney
Labor politics one Alderman Burke counts for more
than all the engineers in captivity.
When various sites on the Monaro (N.S.W.)
Tableland were inspected for closer settle-
ment some time ago, Bibbenluke, regarded
locally as the pick of the plateau, and up
for sale, was rejected as unsuitable. There-
upon it was surveyed into blocks and sold
by auction on January 15. At an average
price of over £6 per acre, the whole of the
big holding was purchased—by men who were
mostly large landholders already. About
15 years ago 16,000 acres of the station
were resumed by the Government, and some
30 genuine settlers acquired blocks of
from 300 to 700 acres. In the intervening
years most of them have made good. In the
face of this it would be interesting to know
why Bibbenluke wasn’t bought as a closer-
settlement area.
“O. Gull” : One of the Queensland Labor
party’s bright schemes for the deliverance
of the masses from their oppres-
sors is a wandering institution
known as Liberty Fair. Camou-
flaged by a merry-go-round for the
youngsters, the Fair embraces
various gambling devices, which
are operated by Trades Hall offi-
cials “for the benefit of local hos-
pitals.” I have never seen or
heard of an ordinary statement of
receipts and expenditure, but I
suppose it is all right.
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Bour-
chier, supporters of the Labor
party, propose to lend the Strand
Theatre, London, free on Sunday
nights _ “for the expression of
Labor ideals, not only by speech,
but by music, art and drama, in
an attempt to satisfy the unsatis-
fied cravings for beauty here and
now, as well as pointing the way
to a civilisation where bread and
beauty will be available for every-
body.” The question to be settled
first is: Who is “everybody”?
Does “everybody” include only
the 40,000,000 of Britain’s pre-
sent population, or is it to in-
clude the 200.000,000 who would
arrive per birth-rate and fast ■
steamer as soon as free bread and
free beauty were available for
“everybody”? Unless the amiable
philanthropists have a bottom-
less bin of bread and beauty, or
some method of limiting the sup-
ply of everybodies, a doubt arises
whether eventually there will be
enough bread and beauty to go
round.
A sinister incident of the Fitzroy (Vie.)
by-election was the Labor threat to declare a
number of pubs “black.” Blackburn, the
Labor candidate, has t.t. sympathies; his
opponent, Boell, breezily announced that he
was totally opposed to prohibition and
favored extending the hotel hours. Not un-
naturally a number of hotelkeepers displayed
posters of the man who was showing himself
such a robust champion of the trade. Labor
thereupon threatened a boycott of the offend-
ing taverns unless the signs came down, and
threw in a threat that employees o%bakers,
butchers, grocers et al. would'be called upon
to refrain from delivering supplies. The
warning had its effect, and the offending
signs disappeared. The secretary of one
Labor organisation described the capitulation
as “a triumph for organised Labor.” It is
really a triumph of organised tyranny.
Wouldn’t Labor supporters squeal like a
slaughter-house full of stuck pigs at any
similar trespass upon their own right to do
or say politically what they like?
Aid. Burke and his fellow “Labor” mem-
bers of the Sydney City Council are agreed
that the government of the city by Commis-
sion would be a very bad thing. They prefer
government by commission-agents.

“You must wake and call me early’’-—no, I think
I’d rather keep
(When it comes) that morn of gala with a little extra

With what exultation we will breast the bar,
Featuring a peck of troubles
Evanescent as the bubbles
When the good old world lobs back to sterling par!
Some there are go “back to Bathurst,” and there
haunts me still a song
On the rapture of returning unto Croajingalong.
But there’s few who may experience that illimitable
bliss,
Whereas every sturdy Briton will participate in this.
From the Orkneys to Kerguelen, from Uganda to

What a thrill will permeate us on that

From Fuller in his Ministerial car
To the chap who spreads the City

Won’t there be a merry smile
Wreathing everybody’s “dile”
As our little world climbs back to
sterling par !
Will it lower the cost of living? Will
the Treasury in a flash
Start redeeming and cremating greasy
piles of paper cash?
Will we have, at least on payday, in
the pockets of our pants,
Sovereigns once again to jingle? Ask
the pundits of finance.
Ask the learned commentators who
habitually range
From the currency’s vagaries to the
problems of exchange.
But, let no glum vaticinations mar
The pleasant frame of mind in which
we are;
No Jeremiah’s views
Discount the gladsome news
That the world is tramping back to
sterling par.
(Courage, friends, the day is coming
when we’ll know the war we won.
Feel convinced we strafed the Kaiser,
well assured we biffed the Hun:
See the chariot of progress, in the mud
so long that stayed,
Once again careering smoothly ’long a

Long the years of tribulation, hard the
times, one must allow,
But the goal for which we struggled
is a trifle nearer now.
When a fellow’s hitched his waggon to a star
He must disregard the frequent jolt and jar,
And this world of ours is whirling
Quick and lively back to sterling—-
Do you get me ? —waltzing back to sterling par!

only nine, and one of the third generation,
who followed the family proclivity for early
marriage three years ago, has so far failed
to augment the population. The old people
went for a trip to England months ago;
their return has disclosed tliajt the lady who
would have been a great-grandmother if
her descendants had done the fair thing by
her has only missed the bonus by having
her brand-new baby born abroad—appa-
rently the trip was not unconnected with
her condition and the event. The admir-
able matron was 16 when her first child
was born; and, although for a woman to
become a mother at 56 is not a record, it
must be one for a new-born intfant to have
a sister who has reached the age of 40. The
near-cliildless descendants regard the occur-
rence as shocking; but it has given their
friends great joy. * #
“Claude de Tropic” : All the. long-distance
marches weren’t done in khaki; some were
merely for the right to wear it. In the
A.I.F. I met a Gulf (N.Q.) prospector who
had set his face Sydneywards to enlist in
the same battalion as his brother. Having
no negotiable assets he walked 600 miles,
and earned sufficient on the way to pay his
train fare for the rest of the journey. There
was a man named Davies with an even more
interesting record. Wishing to see his
father in Melbourne before he enlisted, he
left Merauke, in Dutch New Guinea, where
he was plume-hunting, and travelled by
lugger to Thursday Island. Thence he
worked his passage to Cairns, and with ss.
in his pocket started to walk to Melbourne,
doing odd jobs on the way and getting an
occasional lift. Part of the distance be-
tween Townsville and Brisbane he covered
by temporarily attaching himself to a circus,
and part on a horse presented to him by
a patriotic farmer in the Mackay district.
Reaching Brisbane lie changed his mind
about 'proceeding further [south and en-
listed there.

“Black Watch”: I can vouch for the fact
that the major-general of one Highland divi-
sion in France did not think the homing-
pigeon was a success. When the Highland
Brigade, in July, 1916, opened the Somme
offensive, at the taking of Longueval and
Delville Wood, the pigeon-carrier went over
with my battalion. While the Hun was put-
ting over every description of shell and his
machine-gun fire was doing very deadly work,
the carrier crept into a shell-hole to write
a message. Having written it and fastened
it to the bird, he let it go, never thinking
that he or the bird would survive the shell-
ing. At Divisional H.Q. all was bustle and
anxiety, no message having been received as
to whether the battalion had reached its
objective or been wiped out. Major-General
and G.S.O. 1 and 2 were stamping up and
down when a very tired and dirty pigeon came
flying back to its roost. G.S.O. 1 made a
dart at the bird, tore off the message and read
the following to the General: “Am fed up
with carrying this ruddy bird.”
“Pink Tape” : The defendant in a recent
wife-beating case at a Melbourne court
brought with him a ponderous tome which
suggested that he was going to give the J’s.P.
some points in law. The massive volume,
however, proved to be merely the family
Bible, from which the accused sonorously
rolled out text after text to show that it
was a husband’s duty to chastise his wife
if she failed in obligations undertaken at the
altar. From the way the appropriate pass-
ages were marked and the leaves dog-eared
it was obvious that the reader had been mak-
ing a life-study of the subject. However,
after it had been elicited that the wife’s sins
were mostly such infamies as the neglect to
make toast for breakfast, the defendant, at
least 20 years older than his consort, was
fined £5. Whereupon solemnly warned
the Bench that it was interfering with‘ the
sanctity of marriage, and defiantly pro-
claimed his intention of administering fresh
correction to his wayward spouse for her
rebellious conduct in bringing her lord and
master to court.
“X2X”: Touching the alteration by a
chemist of quantities in a doctor’s prescrip-
tion (B. 29/l/’25). Australian usage de-
mands that the “scrip” shall he compounded
exactly as written. Even in the rare cases
where a doctor accidentally prescribes dan-
gerous or risky doses, or includes two or
more incompatible drugs, the rule is that
the dispenser shall not attempt to . adjust
the error without communicating with the
doctor. For a chemist to alter a prescrip-
tion on his own responsibility would be
exceedingly dangerous. What might look
to him like an unduly large or unusually
small dose of some drug may be demanded
by some special condition quite outside the
chemist’s knowledge. I can recall one case
in which a friend of mine prescribed a
quantity of a drug which was only, about
a tenth part of that usually required in
such cases. The dispenser took it upon
himself to decide that the amount was too
small to do any good, and. after telling the
patient so, increased it fivefold. The patient
happened to be in a condition in which
any but minute doses of the drug in ques-
tion were exceedingly harmful, and the
altered mixture brought about effects which
nearly killed him and retarded his recovery
by months. The matter was reported to the
Pharmacy authorities, who sternly censured
the dispenser, and at the time laid it down
that under no circumstances does a chemist
possess the right to make any alteration in
a prescription.

was everywhere. The waste ground by the
station which in the war-days harbored a
canteen was dank with it. Flags hung
moist and still. The men’s moustaches were
beaded with moisture, and the women’s hair
was rats-tailed. The streets were slushy.
Most of the shops were shut, for Armistice
Day in France is a fete day. In the Rue
Victor Hugo, at the end of which the cath-
edral loomed faintly, a flower-shop was open,
its window full of wreaths tied with bands
of tricolor in memory of “les soldats morts
pour la France .” Outside the cathedral a
blind beggar rattled a tin pannikin. Inside
some very old priests were chanting; a small
acolyte was fidgeting. Against the choir,
towards the still unrepaired east window, an
old man and his wife were praying. Other-
wise the cathedral was deserted. But some-
one else had been there, for among the arti-
ficial wreaths of immortelles and iaurels, on
the pillar commemorating the Australians
and Maorilanders, right in line with the
glories of the north and south windows, was
a bunch of fresh wattle.
“Ellae”: “Flicker’s” Oxford man (B.
8/l/’25) reminds me of a Sydney girl, a
quaint survival of grandmamma’s young days,
who shared a typiste’s job with me lately.
I told her one after-
noon I wanted to go
early, and would “bite
the chiefs ear for half
an hour presently.”
Her horrified recoil
and the “I c-couldn’t
quite think what you
meant” that followed
my explanation plainly
showed she had been
apprehensive that I
might start on her next.

“Chotta Peg”: There was certainly a
“New North Wales” on the maps before
Cook’s time (B. 22/l/’25). I have “A
Modern Geography,” by Pat. Goi'don, M.A.,
F.R.S., published in London in 1719. The
writer says: “Under the title of Terra
Arctica, we comprehend all those northern
countries lying either entirely or mostly
within the Arctic Polar Circle. The chief
of these are Greenland, Spitsberg, Nova
Zembla, Terra de Jesso, New Denmark,
New North Wales. Of these we know little
more as yet than their bare names.” There
is no mention of a “New South Wales” any-
where in the book or on the maps contained
therein. One of them does show, however,
the region round the Antarctic Circle as
“The Land of Parrots, or Terra Incognita.”
Can anyone throw any light on that? By
the way, the “Terra de Jesso” referred to
seems to comprise the more northern of the
Japanese islands.
“Ping Hsu” : The credulity of the Asiatic
is something to wonder at. Singapore has
just had a glaring example of it. In connec-
tion with a new water-supply scheme some-
body started the rumor that little children
were being kidnapped and offered up as a
blood sacrifice to appease the “dragon
spirits.” Feeling ran
high until one day
somebody shouted “kid-
napper” after a pass-
ing Tamil who had
just come to Singapore
on a visit. A crowd
of excited Chinese
chased him around the
town, and the unfor-
tunate man, in an
effort to escape, jumped
into a motor-car. He
was dragged out and
barbarously done to
death with sticks. The
Malay driver got away,
but the mob vented
their fury on the
vehicle, which they
wrecked. All this in
broad daylight in the
heart of a big city!
There is a lesson for
Australia in this,
especially as the next
turn of the wheel may
give the League of
Nations the right to
interfere in immigra-
tion questions.

“Tauwarra”: The

does not encourage
Brown Brother to wear
European clothing, so
when my cookboy held
up a pair of my pants
a trifle past their
prime and offered to
buy them I refused to
do business. “Besides,”
I added, with a glance
at my waist-line, “they
wouldn’t fit you.” “No
fear, taubada!” re-
turned the lad. “This
one terrousers he good
fella fit; plenty timi I
hin try ’em.” There is a vacancy in my
establishment for a cook.
“Nikko”: A Maori]and girl had a trying
experience the other day when there was a
hasty postponement of a big wedding on
account of the non-appearance of the bride-
groom, due by the Sydney boat. His failure
to materialise was not explained until nearly
a month later. Then it transpired that in
Sydney, while returning from a tailor’s to
the hotel where he was staying, he had been
knocked down by a car and taken off to
hospital suffering from concussion. In his
pockets there was nothing to help identify
him, and two weeks of partial unconscious-
ness caused more delay. He turned up
eventually, and after a quiet wedding he and
his nerve-wracked bride slipped off to a
secluded health resort to recover.

ventures at Portland (Vic.), but that doesn’t
prove settlement. I submit that the credit
for that is rightly assigned to Ilenty: quite
enough evidence is preserved at Portland to
prove that, and a tradition still lingers about
the church built by Henty and the first ser-
vice conducted by the old pioneer himself.
When he reached that portion of the ritual
where the minister and congregation kneel,
and the latter solemnly repeats the former’s
words, a whale spouting in Portland Bay
caught Henty’s eye through the open door.
His old instinct asserted itself; and there
followed something which isn’t in the prayer-
book. “There she spouts!” came spontane-
ously to the pastor’s lips. “There she
spouts!” dutifully repeated the congregation.

“Mary Russell then got behind witness, and the

“Toujours le politesse.”—French proverb.
I’ve always admired the French warrior who,
In Fontenoy s melee, his rapier drew
And cried, as the tension was stretching to burst,
“Come, Messieurs the English, you’ll please to fire
first.”
Some will have it the story’s the other way round;
But, I take it, you’ll always be sure of your ground
If you mind your good manners in moments of stress,
And recall the old saw about le politesse.
If, as possibly chances, the reader has been,
In the army, the centre of some shocking scene,
Where a brass-hatted, turkey-tabbed base-wallah toff
Has gone through the process of telling him off ;
Why, then, I am sure he will quickly agree
The experience called for profound strategy;
And he probably wangled escape from the mess
By fixing his thoughts upon le politesse.
On the cricket field, too, when your score’s yet an
“egg,”
If a “straight break” connects with your white-padded
leg
And, in instant response to the enemy’s shout,
An asinine umpire yells, raucously, “Hout!”
Why, that, I’ll admit, is a trying ordeal,
But to high aspirations you must remain leal.
Have “nothing of interest” to say to the Press;
Remember the rule about le politesse.
Or let us take billiards, a game that is prone
To wreck any temper, as most men will own.
Yourself and your rival are 98 all,
When he runs to the hundred by potting your ball!
If you murder him then, by a brainstorm bemused,
Under “great provocation,” you may be excused.
But men have been hanged and for very much less —
So just dwell on the tag about le politesse.
Yet, if it should happen to come to the worst
And you do brain the brute, but your version rehearsed
By eminent counsel conflicts with the view.
Of a thick-headed jury of good men and true,
The prospect’s unpleasant and lacking in hope,
When the one end in sight is the end of a rope;
Still, resolve Mister Ketch with your charm to im-
press,
And “turn off” in the odor of le politesse.

“Percy Pawnticket”: A “View Mat.” ad.
has been figuring in a Melbourne slander
case. The trouble started when a woman
alleged that ail old friend had “got her hus-
band through advertising for one” ; and then
the story slowly unfolded itself. Some years
ago three girls put an advertisement for a
husband in one of the dailies. They had
plenty of opportunities for marrying, they
told one another; but, as they also told one
another, it would be so amusing to see what
answers they got. Of course it was amus-
ing; and they much enjoyed the laughs some
of the letters gave them. It would have
been tactful to have forgotten the whole
business when, only a couple of months
later, all of the girls married men whom
none of them had known two months sooner;
but, apparently, not one of them did forget
it. Hence the allegation, when a quarrel
occurred, that one of the ladies had caught
her spouse through the newspaper columns;
and recriminations along similar lines finally
resulted in a slander action.

stranger still, we could not only hear but
distinguish the orders which were bawled
aboard the monstrous craft. Actually, in-
side the range of a human voice, the atmo-
spheric conditions were magnifying a pass-
ing vessel to thrice real size. On that same
passage some masses of electrified gas
perched upon two or three of our spars, and
illumjned the ship as if she were focussed
by a searchlight. Ilad an atmospheric en-
largement of that illuming been observed
from another ship, the phenomenon would
have appeared even more startling than that
glimpsed from the Bacchante.

“Caractacus ’: With characteristic assur-
ance a Melbourne architect, commenting
upon the disintegration of the foundation
piers of London St. Paul’s Cathedral,
blamed Christopher Wren for permitting a
method of construction at which a modern
cheap contractor would balk —or words to
that effect. Yet Wren’s work, cheap and un-
sound as it is (a rough masonry shell filled
with dry rubble, now gone to powder), has
lasted nearly 300 years. Melbourne has a
St. Paul’s of its own, completed in the early
’seventies—a mere 50 years ago—-of which
the visible “window-dressing” exterior is
crumbling away in flakes; and doubts are
expressed whether general construction has
been well enough planned to permit addi-
tion of the central spire which it is the
ambition of the Cathedral authorities to
erect. St. James's, a little older in origin
but rebuilt about a decade ago. was so ill-
designed that it could not stand the ringing

taken a subtler revenge, and inflicted upon
the unknown the consciousness of everlast-

“Saaedi”: Yes, some burglars certainly
do business in bullheaded fashion (B.
15./l/’25). Three presumably amateur
crooks who recently selected a N.S.W. town-
ship as their scene of operations began by
“borrowing” a sulky. Arriving in the early
a.m. hours, they pulled up at the back of
one of the stores, forced the door and car-
ried out the safe. Placing it in their con-
veyance they drove about a mile out of
town, where they pulled up, and after con-
siderable labor blasted their cargo open.
The contents consisted of merely a few shil-
lings ; what annoyed the storekeeper most
was that the burglars should have wrecked
so much good steel for such a trifle. The
keys, he pointed out plaintively, were hang-
ing on a nail in the store about six inches
above the safe.

“Val Jameson”: An old prospector wrote
to me a while ago:—
I applied for the old-age pension to enable me
to try my luck once more, and to assist me through
to a new state of independence, but my request was
rejected on the grounds that “it has not heen
proved that your income does not exceed the statu-
tory limit'’ I have no income; but having placed
all I po? in tools and provisions to go prospect-
ing, I a,n now in the unenviable position of becom-
ing a pauper at a gallop in this my last venture.
But Fortune followed the footsteps of the
worthy prospector on his “last venture,”
and his latest report is contained in a wire
from the Northern Territory—“On tin.”
“Fana”: The threat of the N. S. Wales
Dental Board to regard advertising by a
registered dentist as “infamous conduct”
and to strike the offender off the register
has come like a thunderbolt to a section of
the profession. Among doctors, of course,
advertising has always been forbidden,
but dentists have been wont to regard
the practice without marked disfavor if not
with entire approval, so that hundreds of
toothsmiths are in the habit of noisily pro-
claiming their special virtues and abilities
through raucous newspaper advts. and in
other ways. But some have been going too
far, among them the individual who was
accustomed to hold parades, headed by brass
bands, thnough the streets of the couuti-y
town in which he temporarily hung out his
plate. If the Board puts its threat into
operation, some practitioners who are in
receipt of large incomes will suffer; for
advertising in dentistry can be made exceed-
ingly remunerative.

“Down SJputh”: The dear old rector of
our parish recently passed away. He was
one of the* old school, and, being somewhat
limited by the liturgy of the Anglican service
in extempore prayer, made up for
it on less circumscribed occasions,
and gained almost as fine a reputa-
tion for being “powerful” in suppli-
cation as the more lusty-lunged min-
ister of the Methodist Church
further down the street. On one
such occasion an elderly and some-
what stiff-jointed parishioner
groaned as he hoisted himself with
difficulty from his knees: “I wish
the rector wouldn't insist on giving
God so much general information.”

“Jobber”: Some Diggers may
have forgotten their debts lightly,
but I remember one glorious excep-
tion. He was an old regimental
cobber, but I hadn’t seen him since
the evacuation until we bumped in
Blighty. Over the inevitable
“spot” we yarned of the early days,
when he suddenly produced a little
book, and began searching the
pages. Then he said: “Do you re-
member seein’ me in Groppi’s with
a shiela one night?” I told him
that I had seen so many in Groppi’s
(and elsewhere) with shielas that
I was not prepared to swear I had
noticed him in particular. He per-
sisted. “But this night when I was
there you come in with a shiela —
and a bonza she was too—and don’t
you remember me telling you I was
broke to the world, and would you
spring 50 disasters, and you come
to light? Now don’t you remem-
her?” At this stage a great light
seemed to burst on me, and visions of magic
nights in Cairo came floating across my
pewter. I remembered, and pocketed a very
welcome 50.

“Herodot”: A curious omission in the
Victorian law was recently discovered by
a solicitor who had defended some Chinese
charged with running an opium-smoking
joint. After convictions had been registered
and fines inflicted, Mr. Costs applied to the
Bench to direct the return of his clients’
opium-pipes which the police had seized.
He pointed out that there was nothing in
the Act to warrant the confiscation of these
implements, and a bewildered Bench, after
a short consultation, was forced to agree—
to the great joy of the Chows, for good
opium-pipes are extremely scarce and worth
anything from £5 upwards. The N. S.
Wales Act provides for the confiscation of
all the apparatus, including even the lamp
with which the drug is “cooked” and warmed
before it is smeared over the inside of the.
pipe-bowl.

“Harold Hardupp”: It was disclosed in
a recent criminal prosecution that a woman
of Cessnock (N.S.W.) collected sovereigns
in jamtins, which she hid under her
house; there was £750 stowed away
when the robber discovered the
hiding-place. Such homely • safe-
deposits were frequent enough after
the bank smashes of the early ’nine-
ties. In those days there was a
wood-and-coal merchant at Padding-
ton (Sydney) who used to pickle-
bottle his money and hide it behind
a fireplace until he had enough in
hand to lend on mortgage. He died
wealthy, but never ran a banking-
account. A fixed deposit much
more difficult to locate was in a
Fitzroy (Melb.) cottage. The old
inhabitant thereof was reputed to
be well-in, yet left no tangible pro-
perty when he died except the cot-
tage itself. A disappointed heir
was having the place renovated a
couple of years later when over a
thousand sovereigns were discov-
ered embedded in the rough plaster of the
kitchen wall.

“Sixenate”: One of the most imposing
memorials in a southern cemetery has an
even more interesting history. Ostensibly it
honors the memory of a doctor's wife; really
it attests the discomfiture of the lady’s rela-
tives. These made trouble between the pair,
alleging that the doctor had married for
money; the result was a separation and a
bitterness that the wife carried with her
to the grave. She may even be said to have
carried it beyond there, for by her will she
devised to her husband only as much money
as he might think proper to expend on a
changed to dismay when they saw the scale
monument; the rest of the estate was to go
to her relatives. The latter’s jubilation was
upon which the medico was honoring his
wife’s memory. He managed to expend the
entire fortune on the affair, sinking the last
few hundreds in a trust to pay for the
upkeep of a light which is continually
burning in the gorgeous pile. The baffled
beneficiaries invoked the law to stop the
extravagance, but a Judge decided that the
disconsolate husband was within his rights.

“Mako”: Talking of marriage services
(8.. 15/l/’25), isn't the Jewish the most
sensible of all. The bridegroom solemnly
undertakes to work for his bride. I don’t
think that word has a place in the services
of other churches.
“Billy See” : Claiming kinship with vice-
royalty seems to be a habit in
A constable doing the rounds of Govcrih-
ment House at 5 the other morning dis-
covered an individual dressed in the uniform
of an aide-de-camp sitting comfortably in
that exalted personage’s office. “It’s all
right, constable; you can go off duty now
I’m here,” wms the greeting. But the con-
stable called a footman, and after an agitated
conference the stranger was challenged about
his identity, and promptly disclosed himself
as the Governor’s son. The footman had
his doubts, and my lady was called from
bed to settle the question. The audacious
individual was ultimately awarded two
months’ hard by a scandalised beak: he
admitted climbing the wall and pinching
the aide’s clothes. The newly-arrived Cam-
pions didn’t seem much disturbed, though
they are probably wondering whether this
sort of thing is a regular part of their job.
“Bo Aim” : I can quite understand a sen-
sitive soul like “S. Gumm’s” (B. 8/1/’25)
being irritated by the rubbish that is in-
flicted on our ears by those theatricals who
tell of their impatience to revisit our sunny
shores, and how firmly they have resisted
the most persuasive lures that England’s
greatest managers could offer. But are they
any worse than those Australians who, after
a trip abroad, air their views on every social
and economic problem that has for cen-
turies worried the countries they have seen?
They discourse on the prevailing and future
fashions, and how nice everyone was to
them. They met everyone of note, but add
that, after all, there is no place like Aus-
tralia (for credulity). The trunks of
clothes they have brought back, the send-
offs and welcome-homes they received are
too innumerable to mention. Of course, we
know why we are told all this ; they would
tell anything rather than the plain unvar-
nished truth, which in many cases would
read something like this:—-
Mrs. S. Nobb has become very bitter since her
trip abroad, and when asked what sort of time she
had, said, her eyes filling with tears, “Oh: don’t
ask me—it was rotten. I wish I had never gone.
Everybody was so rude to me, and I got dreadfully
squashed wherever I went. Did I meet any celeb-
rities ? No, I did not! I spoke to one in the street
one day and got the biggest snubbing I ever received
in my life. Although I wasn't presented I saw the
King and Queen on many occasions, and always made
a point of smiling at the latter, until one day she
pointed me out to one of her escort, who approached
"THE COOK AND THE CAPTAIN, TOO."
“All the officers and n.c.a.’s were skittled.
I had to he captain, lieutenant, ser-
geant”—
“O-o-oh! Did you have to blow your own
trumpet, too?”
me so threateningly that I considered it wise to
retreat. Did I get this dress in Paris? No fear,
this is one I took away with me. I bought no frocks
in Paris; 1 can get them made here cheaper, and,
besides, I’ve got only this one suitcase. Yes. I
daresay the same old crowd that specialises in send-
offs and welcome-homes will be waiting to hand me
a few of the latter.” And picking up her luggage
she went down the gangway to meet them.
THE NEW HOUSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The days were full of yellow dreams,
The nights of scented fire ;
We wandered by the haunted streams
That all men’s hearts desire.
A playmate moon would run in cloud
A race above the trees;
The noonday made the crickets loud
To drown the hum of bees.
And when the violet twilight fell
A star serene and white,
Or some far tinkle of a bell,
Could bring us new delight.
Beneath our heels crisp timber spoke
In wooden whispers faint;
We breathed the sweets of fresh-cut oak,
Of sleek cement and paint.
And it was joy to run and beat
The knockers on the door,
Or feel beneath our sliding feet
The carpet kiss the floor.
Beside the broad verandah rail
You stood, loose-gowned and fair;
I saw the little moonbeams pale
Go dancing through your hair.

Regularly a clamor arises for the munici-
palisation of this co.’s business. And just
as regularly the shouting and the tumult
die; and the Board declares the usual div.
and prepares its case for the next onslaught.
During 1923 the strike on the Maitland
coalfields tied the co. into knots so far as
supplies of good gas-making coal were con-
cerned. In desperation it had to buy at
high prices from as far afield as England.
It bought some of the Commonwealth’s
stock “at grass” at Newcastle —to its sor-
row. The price of gas was lifted temporarily
to Bs. 6d. per 1000 cubic feet, and the pro-
duct raised such howls from Toorak to Fitz-
roy that the Lawson Ministry fell over itself
in its haste to respond to the noise. The
two bills it launched showed the effects of
the haste. Then Lawson went out and
Prendergast came in; and, later, Labor went
back to its usual place and the present
Nationalist-Farmer Government took over.
And the co. is still undisturbed. Regula-
tion sooner or later seems a certainty : much
more of a certainty than purchase. Under the
Metropolitan Gas Act of 1878 the Councils
have the right of purchase ; but the Price, if the
“replacement or reconstruction value” is
accepted as a basis, inevitably must be so
great as to discourage attention under that
clause. Of course, the Government may also
purchase; but with the long list of horrible
examples of State ownership in mind, that
course will not appeal to the electorate,
especially in view of the very large , sum the
State has spent on the more or less competi-
tive electrical undertaking.
The 1923 bill specified a standard div. of
8 p.c. and a standard price. Doubtless a
better considered measure will provide, as
in the N.S.W. Act, for the adjustment of
prices according to production costs, and
will restrict the provision for depreciation
or amortisation. No limit was prescribed
in the old Act. and the management put
large amounts of profit into works that fairly
could have been charged to capital account.
That meant that consumers, in addition to
supplying the co.’s shareholders with robust
divs., gave them new revenue-producing pro-
perty amounting to hundreds of thousands,
so that there has been and is, additional to
visible reserves, the substantial internal re-
serve consisting of works paid for out of
revenue. Here are the figures since 1914: —

Not all could fairly have been charged to
capital; in the past year, for instance,
£15,000 (or more, perhaps) was for the
replacement of a worn-out gasholder. But
it would be easy enough to show that over
many years practically all extensions of
mains, plant, etc., were provided for in
this tvay.
Much has been made of the big divs. paid
by the co. The highest was 214 p.c., but that
was long ago. More important is the string of
13 p.c. divs. since 1913, and last half-year’s
15 p.c. But calculated on their total funds
the return to shareholders amounts to only
5.2 p.c. Every issue of new capital has
been at a stiff premium:—

The insistence on the 13 p.c. ignores the
striking fact there disclosed: that share-
holders, in addition to the capital so-called,
have provided £027,738, for which they arc
entitled to a return. The co. has never
watered its stock by so much as a shilling.
The price charged in 1913 was 4s. 7_d. per
1000 cubic feet; it is now Os. Bd., wtili the
likelihood of a reduction to Os. Od. on March
T> Over that period coal has increased
from 14s. lid. to 325. lid., and labor costs
by 77 p.c., so that the 38 p.c. advance in
price must be accounted reasonable. Last
year coal was not so costly, but 1923 was
the strike year in which the co. had to pay
big prices to keep the retorts working. Re-
venue was a little better: —
1923. 1924.
Cost of coal .. .. .. £671,139 £595,952
Revenue from gas .. .. 1,234,256 1,333,121
Revenue from residuals .. 285,952 284,970
At present the co. produces over five million
gallons of tar annually, and the Board holds
that, with a new site, the entire tar output
could be distilled and the distillate treated.
This, it declares, would add to revenue and
permit of a reduction in the price of gas.
The exploitation of waste products ought,
of course, to be keenly encouraged. The co.,
however, needs a new site with deep-water
frontage, not only to do this work, but to
permit of more economical coal-handling; to
provide for expansion in manufacture; to
allow for greater storage space for coal; to
permit of the transfer to one area of the
plant at present crowded in S. Melbourne,
W. Melbourne, Fitzroy and Tooronga. In
1918, speaking before one of tbe many in-
quiries, the co.’s chief engineer, J. N.
Reeson, said that even with the undesirable
extensions at Fitzroy, the co. could supply
its customers for only a few years. _ Over
six years have passed, and the co. is still
carrying on with its crowded, scattered
plants. It has sought amendment of the
Act governing its financial operations so
that it might raise capital sufficient to pur-
chase a site and centralise operations—akin
to the move of the Australian Gas of Sydney
to Mortlake. It has, in fact, picked a site
at the mouth of the Yarra, where 80 acres
could be reclaimed suitable for its purpose.
It "estimates that it will need £5,000,000 to
finance the move and provide for the expan-
sion of Melbourne in the next five years.
That is big money. Needless to say the co.
asks for security. The investing public has
bought shares at heavy premiums because
the co. was considered to be protected by
tbe Act of ’7B: and the co.’s debenture stock
has been purchased by trustees. Any new
Act must protect the interests of share-
holders and debenture-holders wdio bought
with those guarantees in mind. If Parlia-
ment fixed a standard div. of S p.c. on the
capital ascertained by a valuation of present
assets, the co. would find no difficulty in
raising the funds required. Its present posi-
tion is :

ments and cash .. 271,894 381,027 406,214
The co. has some smudged pages in its
career: it has raised prices when quality
and supply were at their worst; it has, on
occasions, given inferior gas and inefficient
service. But almost without exception these
faults have been due to labor troubles at
some point between mine and meter; and.
naturally perhaps, the suffering consumer
has hit the nearest head —which generally
proved to be the co. and not the real authors
of the difficulties. On the other hand, in
1922, which year was strangely free from
labor troubles, it voluntarily reduced the
price Bd. per 1000. which represented a gift
to consumers of £.136,000.

This cog in Melbourne’s big beer-machine is
sharing in the prosperity of the Trade. Last
year the return from its holding in Carlton
and United Breweries. Ltd. (it has 14.860
prefs. and 102,500 ordinaries) was £17.402.
During the year it increased its prefs. from
£5125 to £17,305 ; its interest in ordinaries
is £102,500, as it was at the beginning. On
the birth of the Combine the Castlemaine
brewery was closed, and the co. in return
got an allotment of shares which included
a certain amount of watered stock: because
of the water the reserves are described in the
table as nominal. The return from the Trust
has moved to record levels. Last year it
was £17,402, a few pounds more than in
1923, £5542 in advance of the 1920 figures
and almost £7BOO greater than the return in
1909. The reduction in the Castlemainc’s
div. rate is due, of course, to the gift issues
of 1922 and 1923, which inflated capital by
£67,587: thus last year’s 10 p.c. meant a
distribution of £4844 more than the 10 p.c.
of two years previously. And, at that, only
60 P-c. of disclosed profits was distributed.
Balance-sheet movements indicate the pro-
gression :

Cash, etc. .. 77 443 35,393 55,393
That, including the realisation of proper-
ties, which the Combine didn’t take over, is
very good for three years and remarkable
for seven. Apart from the holding of C. and
U. B. shares (£119,805) the co. now has
£113,592 net, nearly all of it in public secu-
rities, cash and mortgages, equal in all to
13s. per share. But while the position is
much more comfortable than it was, a 10
p.c. div. looks a rather stiff proposition ; for
£17,500 is 50 p.c. more than the total profits
were in any year prior to 1922, and three
times more than they reached in sbme years.
It is true that the Combine was putting a
good deal into improvements in those years ;
also the co.’s own earnings, apart from the
Combine, must now be a few thousands
greater than they were. Still the State will
have to maintain a very lively thirst to make
the present 10 p.c. a sure thing.

The popularity of this stock is due to the
co.’s modest capital; and the modesty is
due to the circumstances of the co.’s birth.
There was a time when the N.S.W, Western
coalfield’s other name was Poverty, and it
wasn’t till the Lithgow Coal Association
was formed and the marketing organised
that any profits worth mentioning were
made. Since then the railways have pushed
out and Protection has brightened up the
manufacturing outlook; and, though West-
ern collieries have never been in a position
to get big prices and are not likely to, the
modest capitalisation of this co. has enabled
it to show remarkable results. Even now,
though £30,000 was “returned” in cash to
shareholders a year ago and the capital
reduced to £60,000, the co.. before paying
the current div., had £39,638 net of liquid
assets: —

Liquid assets .. £23,424 £75,085 £42,172 £40,804
Liabilities . . 1,108 2,570 2,246 1,166
Surplus .. £22,316 £72,515 £39,926 £39,638
The co.’s liquid assets are thus £32,877 less
than they were 12 months ago. _ That is
to sav, after paying back the £30,000 of
capital, liquid assets have been drawn upon
to the extent of £2877 to (1) pay £13,500
in divs., and (2) pay for any additions that
have been made to plant. What additions
have been made isn’t ascertainable, but
they don’t seem to have been important.
Since the whole thing must come to an end
some time, and since provision ought to be
in progress all the time for complete re-
turn of capital, the 12 months’ history isn’t
as dazzling as the market has got in the
way of expecting it to be. Shares are now
nominally 13s. 4d. each: the market, how-
ever, insists on valuing them at more than
twice that figure. In addition to its mine
the co. has brickworks. A dozen years ago
these cost £12.500. They now stand in the
books at £4554. For some time the return
from the investment was poor; but in the
past 12 months the net return has been
£ll28 —say. 25 p.e. on the capital now re-
presented by this investment —less, perhaps,
a small proportion of the overhead exes.

In the past five years this well-handled co.
has made £68,031 and paid its shareholders
£35,811; so it has put by £27,820, or an
average of nearly 7-J p.c. of the capital p.a.
Especially in view of the fact that the five
years include the rather disastrous 1921,
when stocks had to be written down, the
figures suggest that the 10 p.c. is very safe.
Last year the lay-by was equal to nearly
9 p.c.. and that was notwithstanding some
disturbance of trade owing to a printers’
strike in Perth and the transference of the
Sydney business to a new factory. Things
afe therefore apparently getting no worse;
and a less conservative Board might have
talked about an issue of bonus shares be-
fore now- There is fairly keen competition
in the trade; but on past records this co.
is well able to look after itself. As to the
security for capital this shows the position :

The “shares in other cos.” represent this
co.’s holding in the Westralian business:
it paid only 5 p.c. last year as against 7
the year before, though something may have
been put by. The co. has extended its Mel-
bourne factory and set up another in Syd-
ney during the year, and it has had to run
into debt only another £3OOO or so to do it.
Goodwill no longer figures as an asset; and

£lBl7, or about 7 p.c. on the book value at
the beginning of the year, was written off.
The item stands now at £80.422 ; and as the
capital is £75.000 there, is far less in this
fixed and generally dubious asset than most
manufacturing concerns have to show.

Though the volume of trusts in hand is not
disclosed, the directors say that more people
than ever before have notified that the co.
is to step into their shoes when they are
dead. This hunt for new, and at present
unproductive, business is costing a few
pounds, so that, taking all circumstances
into account, the current return is very
good—net profits have been a mere shade
under 10 p.c. p.a. for the four years past.
Meantime the capital is thoroughly secured.
Practically, as required by law, the whole
of it is in Vic. Government 8 per cents.;
but revenue is getting more help from the
steady accumulation of profits, which are
in Commonwealth stock. It is a handy
little investment with nice possibilities.

Twice reconstructed and weakly-financed
North White Feather Co. (W.A.) is nego-
tiating in London for the sale of 68,289 un-
issued shares in the hands of the liquidator
of the old co. A year ago shareholders re-
ceived one share credited as 3s. 6d. paid for
every three previously held, but this recon-
struction didn’t bring in much cash. At
one time North White Feather and its neigh-
bor, White Feather Main Reef, were regular
gold-producers, and gave between them about
a million sterling. The former now mines
in a half-hearted way ; the latter has long
since abandoned operations.

Wiluna Gold Mines, Ltd., has been raised
from the dead. Through want of funds it
gave up the ghost in 1913, and in the pres-
ence of gloomy creditors its corpse was
handed to the liquidator. Under the latter’s
care the body showed signs of life, and its
vitality lias since gradually increased. Now,
as everyone lias been paid in full and the co.
feels well again, it proposes to resume busi-
ness.

The Westralian Government proposes,
when funds permit, to do some diamond drill-
ing at the north end of Kalgoorlie. Many
rich patches and occasional payable deposits
have been found there, but no large mines.

Warrants substantial State expenditure on
bbreiitde prospecting in any unproved part of
the Kalgoorlie field. In fact, it should have
been provided for long ago.

Unlucky Lanarkshire (W.A.) has thrown
up its option on the old Mt. Burgess, to which
references were recently made on this page.
The co. has tried and turned down three
shows to date. The first at'Hampton Plains
was officially described as valuable, the
second was billed as another Edna May,
while on the strength of a report that Mt.
Burgess had values good enough for a market
flutter £3OO deposit was paid. The co. is
still questing.
Announced at the Associated meeting in
London last month that that co., Gt. Boulder
and Associated Northern each held an eighth
interest in the Wiluna Mines Option Syndi-
cate which A. H. Collier recently formed in
London to open up arid prepare the Wiluna
Mines for flotation. Speaking at this meet-
ing Collier said that practically all the Kal-
goorlie cos. had come into the syndicate.
Experts, he said, reckoned that for every
100 ft. in depth this property would produce
250,000 tons of ore of a recoverable value
of at least £3 per ton, and that 30s. at the
most would be swallowed up in costs and
loss In residues. John Waldington, chair-
man of Gt. Boulder, who also spoke, said he
had heard that the show was likely to de-
velop into a very big thing, perhaps a second.

From London :
Associated Gold Mines of W.A. is dividing its
assets into three parts for distribution among share-
holders. One part, consisting of the old Associated
mine at Kalgoorlie, stores, cash in Westralia, share in
Wiluna option and £15,090 additional working
capital, will be transferred to a mining co., and
Associated shareholders will receive one paid 4s.
share for ever} 7 share now held. The second part,
consisting of 148,841 Iveeley and an equal number of
Vipond shares, will be distributed among shareholders
in the proportion of one Iveeley and one Vipond for
every four shares now held. The third part, consisting
of the remaining assets of the co. and including
approximately 16,800 Huronian Belt shares, 226,000
Iveeley shares, 271,000 Vipond shares and con-
siderable cash and cash assets, will be transferred
to a mining and finance co. in which Associated
shareholders receive one paid Bs. share for every
share now held.
Golden Victory Co., on the advice of “a
well-known mining expert,” has forsaken gold
for silver-lead mining, and will in future be
known as the Angas Co. Golden Victory was
one of the scores of hand-to-mouth Adelaide
cos. which flourished for a time during the
Hampton boom and withered when the slump
came. Its latest spec, is at Thackaringa,
near Broken Hill, the place from which the
first ore ever sent away from the Barrier
was broken. That ore, by the way, never
reached market. It was carted to Menindie,
on the Lower Darling, for shipment, but the
vessel sank and the ore was not recovered.
The near-surface ore at Thackaringa is
mostly line galena.
George Lindsay writes rc “R.N.W.’s”
account of Dunn's Wealth of Nations: —
Here are the facts. I sold Dunn a string of
camels I had brought overland from Port Augusta
(S.A.), and the Afghan driver, Azzim, went with
them. One afternoon Dunn and Azzim returned to
Coolgardie from a prospecting trip, the camels loaded
with rich specimens, which they lodged at the Bank
of Australasia. Dunn refused to speak, so I inter-
viewed Azzim, who told me that he had sworn on
A 1 Koran not to divulge the location. After allaying
the old chap’s suspicion, I asked him if there was
any water near the find. He replied that there was
none; they had to get it from Raeside soak. That
was enough. I hurried off and arranged to borrow
Jack Eastwood’s racehorse The Spinner at sundown.
By this time news of the find had spread over the
camp, and an excited mob followed me wherever I
went. To mislead them I started a game of billiards
at De Baun’s pub, slipped out the back door the
first opportunity, jumped on Eastwood’s horse, and
rode for Raeside soak. I landed there after midnight.
Some well-sinkers wanted to know what I was after,
so I pitched a tale about being bushed, slept at
their camp till daylight, s-neaked out, caught my
horse, and hunted for Dunn’s tracks. I found them
leading northward, and followed them at a hand
gallop till I came to the find, where Dunn's
brother was washing a big nugget he had just found.
He was amazed to see me, but I didn’t stop to talk.
1 pegged out 24 acres to the north of Dunn’s claim,
and was running down to peg the south end for
David Lindsay, my brother-in-law, when Jack Eastwood
and Tom Hardy came galloping over the ridge and
beat me to it. They had received a tip as to the
location from a man who had seen Dunn cross
the track near Mt. Burgess. Just as they finished
pegging, hundreds more came clattering over the
ridge, so I was only just in time. I sold my claim
to Lord Fingall and his partner Myring soon after,
but before Lord Fingall could get to London to
float a co. the Wealth of Nations, after producing
£lO,OOO worth of gold for Dunn, suddenly petered
out. As for Palmer, the N.T. blaekboy mentioned
by “R.N.W.,” I brought him over to the fields with
me. He was with mv partner, Joe Tregear, when
he found a reef whose richness caused old Joe to dance
a Highland fling with joy, but that is another yarn.
New Langi Logan, Ararat (Vic.), an-
nounces once more that it is on “profitable
wash.” Profitable to whom? Shareholders
have never had a div. On January 14 the
166th call of Bd. on 100,000 shares became
due, making 475. 7d. paid up. In other
words, shareholders have put £238,000 into
this gutter, which has not returned them a
penny. The last bull flutter came along soon
after scrip had fallen to lid. —towards the end
of 1922. A gradual absorption of cheap scrip
was followed by glimpses of “profitable
wash.” In January four fathoms yielded
560 z.; and by mid-year 4oz. stuff was the
rule. In July George Bryant tipped 9000
fathoms available, and in October the yields
were 400 oz. a fortnight from 2oz. 17dwt.
dirt. Still no divs., although scrip had been
pushed up to 13s. and some healthy brokers’
commissions netted. Bryant had usually been
a good tipster in the adjoining Cathcart
Central, a consistent div.-payer on 2oz. :#uff.
But his 9000 fathoms proved a mirage in so
far as New Langi development was con-
cerned ; and soon the market petered dis-
mally in unison with the disappearing re-
turns. It is true enough that for a quarter
of a century bulls and bears in Ballarat and
Melbourne found the Langi Logan wash
among the most in its class, and
that the town of Ararat owes half its exist-
ence to one of the worst stringers in the
history of Australian gold questing; but in
the mining sense profitable wash has yet to
be broken into in the workings.

Australian Oil Investments, Ltd., Mel-
bourne, has issued a remarkable prospectus.
Capital is £500,000 in £lO shares, £lO.OOO
in fully-paid shares to vendors, £240,000 of
shares in reserve. Vendors are to take 1
p.c. of the cash capital subscribed '.by the first
issue of £250,000 worth of sharqs, so there
is a sporting chance they will get £2500
cash. Ten per cent, of the cash capital may
be used to pay flotation expenses. The whole
of the money subscribed, less preliminary
exes., will be handed to a trustee co. to
invest in State or Federal stock or deben-
tures, and the interest thereon will be used
for drilling for oil. So there is ,not likely
to be any drilling until whatever - capital is
subscribed earns its first interest. The idea
is to use the interest for drilling and pay
back the capital to shareholders at the end
of seven years. It is a wild scheme. Why
should a man be required to have - £lO.OOO
before he can invest, say. £5OO in, such a
co.? And why. above all. should ‘lie pass
over control of his capital to an outsider?
And why should the 1 p.c. be collected on
that capital? The directors may. go to
allotment on applications for £I2JOOO in
shares. No directors are mentioned, but
Venezuela, Baku and Mexico are referred to
casually.

Kangaroo Hills (Q.) tintield has brought
forth a promising silver-lead show, near
Ewan, worked by Reddie Brothers, who have
sunk 35ft. on it. Quarto veins carrying
galena have made into solid sulphide, and
at present they are gouging out £l2 to £l5
a ton ore. A level which has been driven
at 30ft. gives them no backs, but it shows
a lode varying from Ift. to 3ft. wide for over
40ft. Silver-lead lodes are almost a novelty
on this field, although galena and copper,
the latter particularly, have been found in
the tin-lodes there.
Shaft No. 34 on Mt. Isa leases, sunk in
the search for the northern continuation of
the Rio Grande lode, proved successful. The
superintendent reports that the shaft is in
ore averaging 23 p.c. lead and soz. silver.
North Queensland has done remarkably
well out of tin the last couple of years, and
Stanhills is the next field that is likely to
get a boost from the present good prices.
Chloritic tin-lodes are a characteristic of this
field, but unfortunately they all seem to make
poor outcrops. A number of these have been
tested lately, and ln-ospects are turning out
surprisingly well, as at least half a dozen
have opened up lodes anything up to 6ft.
wide and carrying up to 10 p.c. values to a
depth of 50ft. There is room for a lot of
prospecting work on this field, and, though
these lodes are nothing to get excited over
yet, there are decidedly good chances for the
tin-miner.
Herberton (N.Q.) mills last year treated
13,869 tons ore for 700 tons black tin valued
at £102,374, an average of £7 7s. 9d. per
ton. The outlook for the current term is
governed by the price of tin, but present
levels are profitable.
* * * *
“Investor” makes some comparisons:—
Finney’s Hill (Q.) should east an eye at the
returns of a tribute party that worked the adjoining
property of the Brisbane Silver-lead Co. In 1923
this was leased on tribute for 12 months by two
men; they sank the shaft and drove 120 feet to
cut the main ore body. A small winding plant,
poppet head and a treatment plant had to be
erected. This work was done in record time. The
treatment plant was a wet gravity mill of 10h.p.,
consisting of rolls, jig and a AVilfiey table. They
secured the services of a competent man for the
milling. The result was that the first product was
750 bags of ore weighing 46 tons and assaying 62
p.c. lead and 83oz. silver; gross value, £l2OO.
This was sulphide taken from 120 feet. The mill
was worked 108 hours for this return, and from it all
initial costs were cleared. The tributors had a
trial run of 16 hours on second-grade carbonate ore
from a dump on the surface ; 43 tons of dump dirt
were treated and produced 84 tons of concentrates,
assaying 60 p.c. lead and 68oz. silver. For the
last return (Feb., 1924) the mill was worked 165
hours and treated 474 tons for 64 tons of dressed
ore assaying (carbonates) 60 p.c. lead and 68oz.
silver, and (sulphides) 62 p.c. lead and 81oz. silver.
Compare the above figures from a 10-h.p. plant with
the co.’s present 100-b.p. plant, which produces 500
bags of concentrates with the turn-out working 132
hours per week.
Dr. Wade’s statement in Melbourne that
there was no “commercial showing” (oil and
gas) in Queensland, except possibly the Roma
wet gas, breaks no new ground, and merely
expresses the geological opinion held
there for several years past. What the
public would like to know is his opinion of
the “commercial showing” at. Roma.. Dr.
Wade certainly devoted more time to it than
the Anglo-Persian personnel and other visit-
ing experts in the past. Possibly he prefers
to see R. E. Allan’s completed log at Orallo
before making any definite pronouncement.
Dr. Wade spent a day with Arthur Morry at
his Woolston bore, but Morry is busy fish-
ing in it for lost tools, and hasn’t even a
film of oil to offer anyone at present.
* * * *
Of the two recent supposed oil-finds in
Queensland, that at Quilpie has turned out
a dud • the Longreach bore has a faint ghost
of a chance. L. C. Ball caustically remarks
that there are no indications whatever of
oil at Quilpie. At Longreach the Council
bore has been giving off a petrol odor with a
slight gas emanation. C. C. Morton collected
samples, and these will be tested immediately.
Even if these yield traces of oil the only
thing that can be done is to shut off all water,
which will be a ticklish job now, or put
down a fresh bore to see if there are any
commercial possibilities. Several areas have
been taken up by early birds on the offcliance,
and Longreach district commands geological
respect because several artesian bores there-
abouts have thrown up fragments of inspis-
sated oil.
* * * *
Crown, Mudgee (N.S.W.), finished its
third crushing, 316 tons giving 59oz.—almost
as poor as the previous 950 z. from 746 tons.
W. H. Gundy advises that for the present
only one shift should be worked at the mill,
and that only the best-looking stone selected
from the south workings should be fed to it.
It is a sorry business compared with the
rose-colored reports quoted in the prospectus
and the bulletins issued in the first year.
* * * *
Bundi Tin Dredging Co. still fails to
justify its prospectus, the return sticking at
10 tons a fortnight from 19,000 to 20,000
yards. There is not much to spare above a
pound in this average, whereas Waring’s
boring chart said 26055., that of White 250 z.
and manager George Poole* vouched for
310j5. in 10 acres at the head of the valley,
where the dredge is operating. Just before
his death the late T. H. Martyn wrote that
lie was disgusted with the bad start and
subsequent obstacle race, but was convinced
that “Bundi Valley is full of tin, and we
shall get it.” The prospectus did not take
stock of the. submerged timber and driftwood
which has hampered operations.
* * # *
Bribbaree (N.S.W.) reports having treated
101 tons for 200 oz. for the first fortnight
Avorked in 1925. The stopes being opened
u]» carry from a foot to two feet of 2oz.
stuff, and so the battery should maintain its
average yield for a while. The trouble is
that tonnages are too light for an SO,OOO
share register.
Lake MacDonald (S.A.) is the main
source of Australia’s gypsum supply. The
deposits are enormous, and extend around
the lake and back from the shore for several
miles. At present they arc mined only to a
depth of 3ft.—beyond that they are impreg-
nated with salt. The mineral is of very fine
quality, and cos. exploiting the area are
working at full pressure. The booming build-
ing trade provides the principal market.

The last Englishman known as the Earl
of Oxford—the title which H. H. Asquith,
Britain’s Liberal leader, takes—was Alfred
Harley, son of the fifth earl, and only sur-
viving brother of Lady Charlotte Bacon,
Byron’s “lantlie.” The sixth earl died at 44,
in 1853, when the title under the second cre-
ation became extinct. A niece of the last
lord resides at Walkerville, near Adelaide,
and has passed her 90th year. She is the
widow of Chas. Burney Young, pastoralist
and politician of S. Aus., and youngest
daughter of Lady Charlotte Bacon, who lived
in S. Aus. for 12 years. Harry D. Young,
S. Aus. M.P., is a grandnephew of the last
Earl of Oxford, and so is his elder brother,
ivho is a clergyman at Bath (Eng.).
Bruce, speaking at the A.N.A. banquet,
claimed to be “the first Prime Minister to
employ all Australian-made articles in his
Cabinet.” And none of the Natives put in
a word for their old leader, Alfred Deakin,
who really earned the distinction in 1907.
After the English-born Tom Playford quitted
the Defence Department in January of that
year, Australia was ruled for nearly two
years by a Ministry of Australians: Deakin
(born in Vic.), Lyne (Tas.), Forrest
(W.A.), Ewing (N.S.W.), Chapman
(N.S.W.), Mauger (Vic.), Groom (Q.),
Keating (Tas.), Best (Vic.) and Hume Cook
(Vic.). Nor is the Priminister’s contention
true of his present Cabinet. Pratten is a
Bristol man, and Neville Howse comes from
Zummerzet.
Through Chief Justice Cullen’s retirement
from the Bench, Robert McMillan (W.AQ
becomes by length of service senior r T.Lf
Justice in Australia. As he recently had his
67th birthday, he is also the oldest of Uem.
Street (N.S.W.), Murray (S. Aus.), Nicholls
(Speck) and McCawley (Q.) are Australian
born, and so is Adrian Knox, Chief Justice
of the Commonwealth. Irvine (Vic.) was
born in Ireland and McMillan is a Londoner.
Sir George le Hunte, just dead at 72, had
one streak of bad luck in his otherwise mildly
successful career as an official of the British
Colonial Office —it was his fate to
succeed Sir William Macgregor as Gov-
ernor of British New Guinea, now
called Papua. A good-looking, pleasant-
mannered Cornishman, Le Hunte came to
New Guinea, like Macgregor, from Fiji;
but a slight lameness prevented him from
carrying on the exploring work of his pre-
decessor. He was too easy-going to be quite
a success in New Guinea, and he made mat-
ters worse by importing English officials;
but later, as Governor of S. Australia, he
was a genuine success.
Saul Solomon, of Northam (W.A.), who
entered his 90th year on January 15, is bale
and hearty. Joseph, his dad, lived to over
a hundred. Saul was born in London and
came to Vic. soon after the gold discoveries,
pie was an alderman of Adelaide for many
years, and a member of the S. Aus. Parlia-
ment in 1887-90, defeating Tom Playford for
E. Torrens. There were 11 lawyers in the
S. Aus. Assembly when Solomon sat there:
only two now—Barwell and Denny.
A record majority for a secretary at an
A.W.U. election was scored at the Mel-
bourne conference by Ted Grayndler. When
Donald Macdonell died, in 1912, Grayndler,
who had been secretary of the Victorian -
Riverina branch, was promoted. The. union
had 40.000 members then: it now claims
330,000. Grayndler was one of the first
members of the old Shearei's’ Union when it
was formed at Ballarat as a result of an
advt. inserted by David Temple; and he
was through the big battle with the Machine
Shearers’ Union later on. This year his
majority for his job ran to over six thousand.
He has been a stickler for arbitration, and
because of his untiring war-work for the
many thousands of A.W.U. men who served
overseas he was nearly—very nearly—
0.8. E.-ed. There is no harder toiler in Aus-
tralia; he is travelling nearly half his time,
and a second-rate “commercial” with a twen-
tieth of his responsibility would laugh at the
screw and allowances he gets.
Dead at Auckland (M.L.), at the age of
74, Charles Ranson, manager of the North-
ern Steamship Co., who took over that con-
cern when it was about to be wound up and
its shares were unsaleable at Is. 6d. Under
Ranson the original fleet of eight vessels grew
to over 40, and the derelict became a decent
div.-payer. His hobby was racing: he raised
the first £lOOO stake offered in M.L., the
Wanganui Cup, and was for many years a
steward of the Auckland Racing Club.
R. D. Meagher, man of many parts, who
bore without eclipse a 30-years’ disqualifica-
tion from the roll of N.S.W. solicitors, likes
to put a polish on the ugly things of the
police courts. Recently he was defending a
seaman for broaching a case of something
or other. Says Meagher :
“My client did not fall into such a wrong-doing
like the flicker of an eyelid. No! He was borne
on the vortex of an irresistible current. When he
was five years old he lost the guiding and nurturing
hand of his mother. A few years later, when boys
of his own age were wearing the peaked coats and
glossed collars of Etonia, his child’s neck was
decorated with the itching sweatrag of the foetid
fo’c’s’le. His Alma Mater lay among the grimed
crews of many a trackless track that lay by Ind.”
The “one month hard” of the beak brought
all hands to earth again.
Morris Symonds is giving £5OOO to the
Hebrew University at Jerusalem. It is the
first known contribution of Australian Jewry
to this institution, though plenty of Ameri-
can dollars have gone that way: the Uni.
is to be opened this year, with Einstein as
one of the professorial staff. Many Jews
believe that this University will in time
make Jerusalem the world’s educational
centre. Morris Symonds is a wealthy Syd-
ney man who has been for some time past
a liberal donor to all Jewish activities in
the city where, he made his fortune, begin-
ning it in a second-hand furniture-shop. '
J. Kitchen and Sons lost their chairman
of directors when J. 11. Kitchen died the
other day in Europe, whither he had gone
to look for health. A Melbourne native, he
was a branch manager there at 21, and later
went to the Cold Country to set up the
firm’s shingle. Returning in 1902, he was
instrumental in the absorption of the Sydney
Soap and Candle Co. into the Kitchen pro-
prietary.
E. W. Hawker, M.A., LL.M., F.G.S., the
S. Australian pastoralist who took up metal-
lurgy as a hobby many years ago, was 75
last week. His dad was the late G. C.
Hawker, M.A., founder of Bungaree and
other S. Aus. stations ; his son, E.W., married
a daughter of Chief Justice Stawell of Vic.
MARR, M.H.R., lately Government Whip,
who has been given a place in the Fed-
eral Cabinet.
A. C. Willis, who may or may not be made
a Labor Senator by the Fuller Government,
was the functionary who during the 1917
strike dealt with the applications for “per-
mits” to ride on “scab” trams and trains.
Applicants were generally union secretaries,
pickets and such anxious to set about their
good work with clear consciences.
A good Australian went west lately in
Kent (Eng.)—Colonel L. G. Mac Donnell,
M.D. His death was the result of heart
affection, a legacy from Gallipoli. His mother
is a sister of Lord Incliiquin. The colonel
was well known in the central west of
Queensland, and as M.O. in charge of the
military hospital at Kangaroo Point, Bris-
bane, where his kindness to the Diggers won
many friends.
John Lowther surveyed Fowler’s Bay,
Eucla, Bundaleer, Canowie and Belalie in
his and South Australia’s youth. With
Goyder he went through hostile blacks to
Darwin, and worked on the overland tele-
graph line. He made a raft once from the
tailboards of a number of Government tip-
drays, and ferried his party across swamps
and swollen rivers round about Daly Waters.
He would have gone down with all hands on
the Gothenburg if he had not been so well
entertained at Darwin’s only pub that he
was asleep when the vessel left. In 1894,
alone, he travelled overland from Port
Augusta to Coolgardie, an unprecedented
feat. Now from an altitude of 85 hale years
he prophesies that the N.T. has as great a
future as he has had a past.
J. B. Ronald, Presbyterian meenister, who
was a member of the first Federal Parlia-
ment, has had his appointment as a regis-
trar of civil marriages cancelled by the Vic.
Executive Council. When he had no longer
the right to tie knots because he was not
engaged in regular church work the Chief
Sec.’s Department gazetted him under Sec.
18 of the Marriage Act —the provision which
enables the Gov.-in-Council to appoint or
remove civil registrars. “Non-compliance
with the requirements of the Act” is the
reason given officially for the cancellation.
So the old chap, who has methods of his own,
has got one more knock to add to the number
he has suffered in the last 20 years.
The passing of Alfred Moses, sec. of Mel-
bourne Softgoods Club, caused many a twinge
of regret. Nature designed him for the job
he held: he must have known as many people
as the most popular of Senators, and he had
a wonderful memory for faces and voices.
The metropolitan committee of the Vic-
torian A.N.A. which runs the Foundation
Day fete at the Exhibition has for its chair-
man J. A. Cohen. Greeting Governor Strad-
broke, who was principal guest, he said he
thought it apt that one of his name should
have the chance of congratulating his Ex. on
the victory of Night Patrol in the Wil-
liam Reid Stakes at Moonee Valley on the
previous Saturday. The Earl later on ex-
plained that he hadn’t contracted the habit
of racing in Australia. It had been in the
family blood for a century at least.
Professor William A. Haswell, an Edinboro'
Scot, came to Australia in 1879, and was
soon Curator of the Bananaland National
Museum. Next, 43 years ago, he was ap-
pointed Demonstrator of Zoology, Compara-
tive Anatomy and Histology at Sydney Uni.,
and soon after Professor of Biology and
Botany. A prolific writer, he published
books on zoology and other subjects. Retir-
ing from the Uni. after 27 years, he took
things quietly till the end, at one year over
the allotted span.
Frank Grose, who comes back to his native
city as organiser for the Sydney Y. Emma,
is remembered by many a First Div. Artil-
lery Digger. He was “one of the boys,” as
distinct from the Y. Emma rep. who consorted
with brass-hats. On one occasion he held
up at a cross-roads a crack Pommy regiment
which tried to cut in "between the tail of the
brigade and Frank’s couple of limbers laden
with Y.M. stores. Frank spurred his de-
crepit old hack, Flyblow, in front of a snort-
ing, swearing majah and refused to budge
until the last packet of Y.M. cigarettes had
rejoined its unit. Grose could make an en-
tertainment out of a shell-shocked piano
and a feed out of a cup of cocoa. He put
his adventures into print in “A Y. Emma
Bloke.”
“Adamascus”. Mention of Justice Lut-
wyche, Queensland’s first Supreme Court
Judge, recalls one unusual r6le (unusual for
a judicial luminary) in which he figured.
His Honor was on his way to Rockhampton,
with an array of legal talent, to conduct the
trial of one Griffin; and when the steamer
called at Gladstone the Judge was served
with a writ for a substantial amount. He
had banqueted the Duke of Edinburgh when
that sprig of royalty was in Queensland, and
had contested the caterer’s account, main-
taining that the charges were too high and
the catering poor. The case was heard later
in Brisbane, and the Judge had to pay up.
One can imagine Lutwyche’s ruddy face
gleaming with indignation as he submitted
himself to the rigors of cross-examination.
Mount Pleasant, Bathurst, the _ burial-
place of Sydney’s just-dead pathologist, Dr.
Jamieson, is a historic spot. The 3rd Buffs,
commanded by Colonel Stewart, arrived in
Sydney in 1823, On the retirement of Gov-
ernor Brisbane on December 1, 1825, the
Colonel was Acting-Governor for 19 days
awaiting the arrival of Ralph Darling. (Bris-
bane had left a number of men under sen-
tence of death, to be dealt with by his suc-
cessor. Stewart reprieved the lot.) Before
leaving with his regiment Stewart had
secured, as was his right, the estate which
he named Mount Pleasant. On his return
from India, having obtained the rank of
major-general, he occupied the property, liv-
ing in a cottage home with a “round house”
as guardroom at the gate. On his death a
roomy vault was constructed on the top of
Mount Pleasant, and a team of bullocks was
employed to haul the coffin up the hill. The
present house was built by the General’s
eldest son, who died a short time ago at a
few years short of a century. Mrs. Jamieson
is a grand-daughter of the old Buffs’ com-
mander.
ARUNDEL ORCHARD, director of tin
N.S.W. State Conservatorium of Music.
A genial sportsman is lost to Adelaide in
Magnus Wald. Always at the waterside on
the business of the S.A. Stevedoring Co., he
sailed the cutter Magic in races, but mostly
on cruises. His chief monument is the Yacht
Squadron, for which, as secretary, he got
hundreds of members and a luxurious club-
house on the Esplanade at Semaphore—the
latter replaced a shanty on the Port River
bank. He lived to be 61.
OUT WEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The stars, the wondrous stars we knew, still light
the Western plain ;
The wattles, hung with pearls of dew, grow green and
gold again;
And somewhere west of Dandaloo
The drovers’ sweethearts drovers woo,
And station horses mooch along with hunched backs
in the rain.
It hasn't changed. The homestead roofs are gleaming
in the sun;
The horning ring of weary hoofs still knell the day
that’s done;
And further out from Boggabri
The old bush people live and die,
And tell of early struggles and of fights they lost
and won.
In little things you’d notice change, but, taken large
and long,
The level plain, the mountain range, the crooning
biliabong
Are just the same as when we trod
The dusty track artd found that God
Was sometimes very kindly to the outcasts of His
throng.
The older folk are mostly gone across the Great
Divide,
But still the young ones coming on have whips of
pluck and pride.
They haven’t learnt that going slow
Will help the starving crops to grow,
Nor waving bloody banners will replace the stock
that’s died.
They haven’t learnt to spurn a mate because he's
down and out;
They haven’t learnt that windy prate’s a remedy for
drought;
They’re honest as the prads they ride;
They’re straight and true, with nought to hide;
They’re every one Australian with a heart that’s good
and stout.
TOM WALSH.
It doesn’t matter what they say or write about the
West,
The spirit’s living there to-day that fits Australia best,
And still will live when distant years
Sweep present joys and present tears,
With those who share and shed them, to the last
unbroken rest.
So long, old friend, the good work’s done: the far-
reflecting flame
Of pioneering battles won, of strife that leaves no
shame,
Has touched a nation with its light,
And we who see her coming might
May turn our eyes to westward and thank God it’s
still the same.
VICTORIA.

BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“U. K. Lyptus”: I have gathered a parcel
of allegations for and against the marsupial tiger,
but never met a coroner w T ho has held an inquest cn
the defunct. From where Hartley’s Creek debouches,
circa 30 miles north of Cairns (N.Q.), it’s three
miles to its precipitation per waterfall from the
FORGOT HIMSELF.
“’Ow d’yer come to lose yer job, mate —did the boss catch yer
loafin’?”
“No, the union seckert’ry caught me workin’.”
Coastal Range and the commencement of the lawyer-
vine scrub. What with stiiiging-tree, fish-hook,
saucy Jack, grappling irons and barbed, thorny impedi-
ments, apart from the lawyer-vine, I doubt whether
a completer outfit of entanglement could be discovered.
In one portion of this maze I spent four days, and
the best part of my carcase, in negotiating about
two miles. At the north-western declivity of Mount
Mar, where a landslide has inundated the landscape,
a previously unheard voice of the jungle came to
my ears. As near as I can describe it, it bore a resem-
blance to the roar of a furious lion, accompanied
by an orchestra of cassowaries, and continued inter-
mittently nearly a whole afternoon. Adam Hamilton,
a scrub explorer of 30 years’ experience around these
parts, related a similar experience that befell him
25 years ago at the head of Hartley’s Falls. Some
weeks subsequently, on the partial healing of my
lacerations, I made another effort to penetrate from
a more northerly point to the Black Mountains,
when, on the slope of a precipitously banked creek,
I encountered a track resembling in all other respects
that of an oversized lion, or tiger, with the excep-
tion of the abnormal imprint of the claws, which
extended between seven and eight inches from the
toepoint. As the scrub surface is composed of
humus and loose leaves in all stages of..decay, the
following of tracks was an utter impossibility. The
Veivers Brothers, bred and born in these scrublands,
and thorough bushmen, whom *1 consulted, could
shed no light. The tree-climbing kangaroo is dis-
qualified from the argument, and my 40 years’ experi-
ence as an explorer and prospector in every isolated
part of this continent can vouch that neither the
track nor the noise belongs to any known quadruped.
Peculiarly weird noises emanate from intertwined
trees grinding with the motion of the wind, but
as no aerial movement disturbed the scenery, that
theory must be rejected.
* * *. *
“Ornitli”: Can any of the Council tell us
whether it is the male or the female emu that tends
the young birds until they are able to fend for them-
selves ? And is it usual for the old bird to put
up a fight in their defence when molested? While
motoring near Narracoorte (S.A.) recently, a party
put up an old bird with several young ones. The
old bird, finding it impossible to attract or drive
the chicks off the road, turned on the car and vici-
ously attacked the occupants.
* * » *
“Simon II.” : When I was a kid I had a
fox-terrier. He was a noted snake-killer, and was
successful if left alone. He got into holts with a
six-foot black snake one day, and a retriever pal of
his gave a hand and helped to mix things to such an
extent that, the snake got hold of the terrier by the
ear, and held on until I killed it. .1 was 10 years old
at the time, and, a recent lesson on the treatment of
snakebite being fresh in my mind, I cut off half the
dog’s ear, sucked the wound, and carried the dog home
a distance of three miles. The dog and I wept in uni-
son on the journey. The dog recovered, and resumed
snake-killing. He was bitten by all kinds fully a
dozen times afterwards, and, like “Golub’s” pup (B.
l/l/’25), used to make for the nearest water and be
in it for 10 or 15 minutes. He died of old age. It
used to be a theory that if a female dog was bitten
by a poisonous snake and recovered, her progeny
would be immune. Perhaps “Golub’s” pup had that
sort of mother.
* * * *
“Gouger”: In parts of N.Q.’s tropical
jungles there grows a fairly small shrubby tree which
at certain seasons of
the year exudes glo-
bules of the purest
gum. The stuff is
nearly transparent,
some of it like crystal
tears with the sun
shining through. This-
gum is easily dissolved
in water, and is used
thus in place of gum-
arabic. I gummed my
mail with it for years,
and men living in those
out-of-the-way parts
use nothing else where
a strong gum is neces-
sary. I wonder if it
has any commercial
value ? In ' the old
world they have from
time immemorial been
to a lot of trouble
and expense in procur-
ing gum-arabic. Long
before Pharaoh’s ambi-
tion rose to the Pyra-
mids, the Gyppos were
using gum, which the
Egyptian fleets brought
from Aden as far back
as the seventeenth cen-
tury b.c. It reached
barbaric Europe in
1340, brought b y
Italian merchants trad-
ing between Egypt and
Turkey. At present
the world probably uses
more gum-arabic in a
year than it did in 100
years before the uni-
versal use of paper.
Why is it that this
tree of our own tropi-
cal lands, with its valu-
ale gum product, ii»
not put to commercial
use when there is a
greedy world market
awaiting it ?
“H.V.E.” : I have struck a very pale-grey
snake on a Monaro (N.S.W.) bluff covered with
volcanic stones. This reptile may have been the
lead-colored snake, but the color is usually darker.
There are two other records of lead-colored snakes
occurring in that district; one was about four feet in
length. This species is solid-toothed, and therefore
harmless. Again, in a South Coastal (N.S.W.) scrub,
I just missed stepping on a pale grey snake about
a foot in length which promptly glided under a log
too heavy to shift, and it thus evaded identification.
There is, too, a grey whip-snake. There are about
34 non-venomous and about 64 venomous Australian
snakes so far recognised by science, many forming
single examples only, so that very little is known
of their range, maximum lengths, etc. If “Tully-
Banyan,” armed with a large pickle bottle, would
frequent the locality where he saw his “white snake”
(B. 11/12/’24), he might give a new specimen to
the scientific world.
HIS CLEAN SHEET.
THE BEAT: "I'll say this fer meself, lady , I owe no man anythink.”
“X2X”: Although the horse is more given
to kicking than biting, there are few worse wounds
than one inflicted by its teeth. Because of the
manner in which they are placed in the jaws, they
become locked in the flesh of the victim, so that
when a proper grip is secured they do not come
free of the flesh when the horse lets go. The result
is a gaping wound, the flesh being generally torn
badly along both sides; the same kind of injury
is caused when a stab is inflicted with a j)air of
closed scissors and the latter are opened within the
wound. Recently a doctor in a country town in
N. S. Wales showed me photographs of the arm of a
boundary-rider who had been bitten by a young
horse he was breaking in. The flesh was torn from
just above the wrist almost up to the elbow; it
had been necessary to insert more than 50 stitches,
and the injury took seven months to heal completely.
“Yarrum” : Wliat lias the Council to say
about this lot? Pat Egan, of near Merriwa (N.S.W.),
had a couple of apricot-trees—the best bearers in
the district* —growing in his lucerne patch. Thinking
they were hindering the crop, Patrick cut one tree
out. That was three years ago, and the tree left
hasn’t borne fruit since. I expect somebody to
talk inoculation; but the best apricot-tree I can
think of is at Haberfield, and it is the only fruit-
tree in the yard.
* * * *
“Moe”: The shrub mentioned by “Stooks.”
which burns while green when a match is applieo
to it (B. 8/l/’25), no doubt does so because of
the presence of resinous gums. Such vegetables are
by no means uncommon. New Guinea has a small
tree which will take Are in the same manner ami
remain alight sometimes for days, its gums burning
very slowly. At the same time they give out a
pungent odor, which can be smelled from afar. One
variety of Australian gum will sometimes burn
in the same way: the oil in this vegetable burns
with a thick smoky flame. The curious thing about
it is that the wood-tissue of the tree does not'catch
alight.
* * * *
“Reka”: “Tarago” (B. 15/l/’25) is right:
animals do reason. Recently someone threw out a
lump of sopped bread for the sparrows. A minute
later our old cat, who would scorn sopped bread as
food, was seen carrying it across the lawn. He
placed it carefully in front of a geranium bush, and
secreted himself behind the shelter; in other words,
set a sparrow-trap—-and got two birds in as many
minutes!
* * * *
“Velu”: My idea is that the main thing
in combating ropiness in bread is to see that your
bread is slightly acid in reaction. This can be
accomplished by adding five ounces of glacial acetic-
acid or three bottles of vinegar to 2801 b. of flour.
Another important factor is quick cooling after the
bread comes from the oven; it should also be stored
in a well ventilated and, if possible, cool place.
Finally, all the utensils should be thoroughly
cleansed with a hot, strong solution of washing-
soda before and after baking.
* * * *
“Pick”: For the construction of bush
musical instruments, Bert Watson, a Bombala
(N.S.W.) bandsman, may be awarded the baton.
The main portion of his home violin consists of
two kippered-herring tins. He has a mandolin
fashioned out of a cattle-pumpkin shell, and his
masterpiece is a banjo whose body is a cork-lined
hard-hitter hat. From each he can unwind melody
worth going miles to hear.
* * * *
“Troophorse” : Remarkable discoveries re-
suited from the recent
cruise of H.M.A.S. Ger-
anium on the Great
Barrier Reef between
Townsville and Cairns.
For six months this
warship has been cruis-
ing in search of un-
charted reefs, and inci-
dentally collecting new
varieties of fish, sea
snakes, crabs and coral.
Accompanying the ves-
sel was a seaplane, and
with its aid some 800
square miles of ocean
between Townsville and
Cairns were searched
with the greatest cate.
Several reefs hitherto
unknown were dis-
covered ; and it is ex-
pected that some of the
marine specimens ob-
tained will prove to
be varieties so far un-
known to scientists.
Among these is the
“Chinaman fish,” which
weighs four to five
pounds and has narrow
Oriental-looking eyes.
Some say the flesh of
the fish is poisonous,
but several of the
officers had a hearty
meal off one or two,
and are still alive.
Tall yarns of sharks
are told, but really big
monsters of this family
were actually seen.
Some would measure
30 feet.
* *
“Wainui”: For the most thrilling aerial
combat I plump for a battle royal between a M.L.
sparrow-hawk and a ground-lark. The sparrow-hawk
preys on small birds, and the ground-lark is about
the only one which can elude its attacker. The
lark is quick, nose-diving and turning and twisting
with remarkable suddenness and at great speed,
while the hawk is clumsy and no match for its oppo-
nent when it comes to a question of manoeuvring.
It takes time, too, for the hawk to get up speed,
whereas the little lark can be in the 100-m.p.li.
section in a few seconds. To see two of these Maori-
landers fighting recalls mid-air combats between
Avros and De Havilands.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: “Gouger” notwithstanding (B.
8/l/’25), no mainland Australian black ever used
tobacco in any form till the white man came,
though some tribes used the narcotic pitchuri ; the
evidence of early explorers on that point is incon-
trovertible. The York Peninsula blacks whom
“Gouger” describes as smoking from the bau-bau,
or bamboo tube, probably learned the trick from
the Papuanised abos. of the Torres Archipelago; at
any rate, though two or three varieties of tobacco
grow wild over most of Australia, the blacks have
never shown any knowledge of its properties or
of its preparation. It is doubtful, too, if the coastal
Papuan, with the betel-chewing habit, was a
smoker in his primitive days. The mountaineers,
cn the other hand, being without betel-nut, grew
REJUVENATION.
“Come on, Uncle —what about a beauty-spot
before you go to by-bye ?”
and smoked tobacco, and barter may have led to an
exchange of the two habits. Tobacco was known
in “the East” ages before Raleigh’s day, and
probably came to Papua with the Malay traders.
Some of the tribes of Borneo and other parts of
Malaysia, notably the Dyaks, use the communal
bau-bau pipe of the Papuan.

MCDONALD’S WIFE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
McDonald’s wife was ill indeed,
And Mac himself was scared
Rest Fate, neglectful of his need,
Should fail his frenzied prayers to heed,
And she should not be spared.
McDonald's wife was ill and weak;
Her plight was sad to see.
But still she smiled —she could not speak—
To see the mighty Mac so meek,
So full of misery.
But we, who could not help but know
The terrors of the life
That Mac had ventured to bestow
So many weary years ago
Upon his hapless wife,
Though charged by all we held most dear
To pray, at Mac’s request,
Decided not to interfere
With that which was, it would appear,
Her only chance of rest.
Weeks passed; the crisis came and went,
And, nearing there one day,
We heard Mac roar, as if he meant
To show us all that to repent
Was not McDonald’s w r ay.
Smiling (we came to offer aid—
Che still was far from well),
She faced him, frail but undismayed:
'“Although it was for death 1 prayed,
At least I’ve had a spell!”

“Te Wliare” : “Pick’s” Monaro bird of evil
(B. S/l/’25) is not easy to identify by so slight a
color description. The only bird which at all fits
the bill is the rare grey goshawk (Astur clams'),
which is mainly a coastal district species, and in-
habits densely timbered and scrubby country. I have
seen this predatory fowl twice only. In one instance
the bird dashed at great speed at a company of
big crimson rosellas (late “crimson parrot”) which
were feeding on wattle seeds near by. The
is savage, and would not, I think, if out of its

BINGGI: “By cripes, boss, that pheller nothing wantem open gate all right!”
latitude, hesitate to prey on sheep’s eyes and lambs’
tongues. It has a somewhat raven-like appearance,
especially when hunched up on a bough, meditating
evil. None of the raven, crow or crow-shrike
family, owing to their different coloring and mode
of flight, fit the description of “Pick’s” strange
fowl. There is also a white goshawk, another rare
species. I have seen it once only on Monaro; it
was then perched on top of a tall dead tree. In
this instance the coloring is pure white, but the
grey goshawk is slaty-blue in general coloring, with
white underparts, finely barred with grey. All the
goshawks prey to some extent on small snakes, rats
and mice, and in this respect do good service.
* • * *
“Wei-rimee”: Binglii’s well is not easy to
locate in dry country when it is in the ground, or
is a small rock hole with no trail leading to it;
but sometimes the well is up a tree, and then it. is
harder to find than a native-bees’ nest. A clean
tree with a good hollow running down from where
the main branches fork is chosen, and soft mud
or clay is dropped into it until there is a -water-
proof bottom about 2ft. thick. Tiny channels are cut
in the bark of the limbs, and bark and grass are
arranged so that in rainy weather the water running
down the branches converges into the hollow. In
dry weather the top is covered, and the bark and
grass removed. Subsequently, when Binghi comes
there with a thirst, his gin climb 3 up the well,
lowers a vessel into it with a string, and gets) him
, a fine cool drink.
* * * *
“.Tesmond”: I don’t know about w T ild
rabbits doing -without water, but tame bunnies cer-
tainly do not require any. Our pair of white rabbits
have not had a drink for six months, and during that
time the doe has reared three litters. Not cne drop
of water or milk has been put in the hutches, yet all
are thriving exceedingly.
* * * *
“H.W.F.”: Ever play leapfrog with a
crocodile? It is quite exciting. Four of us lately
went on a fishing trip to Constant Creek, about
10 miles north of Mackay (Q.). We were drifting
down the creek in a flatty and were under a six-
foot mudbank. Jack had got ashore to poke into
a crab-hole, and I was standing in the centre of
the boat to watch the result. All of a sudden a
rushing noise came from the mangroves immediately
above us, and a croc. , that I’ll swear was 15ft.
long jumped square over the top of us, passing
within a foot of my head, and landed in the
water with a splash that nearly swamped the boat.
We saw two the following day, and were within
50 yards of one big feller, but as we hadn’t a
rifle, and nobody wanted to pat him on the head, we
just passed on.
* * * *
“Nitric”: Tell “Bodge” (B. 15/l/’25) he
can remove that swarm of bees from the side of
his house without pulling the place down. Bore
one or two holes in the wall near the “ceaseless
murmuring drone” that keeps him awake. Take
a medium-sized syringe and fill it with liquid
ammonia (obtainable at any chemist). Then gently
press the bulb of the syringe, at the same time
listening for the cease of the drone. The ammonia
is pungent enough to remove a swarm of death-
adders, and it is a gas which diffuses rapidly, so
that it will soon spread over the infected area.
Ammonia syringes now replace the old-fashioned
smoke bellows once used by apiarists.
“Ilomfrey Beale”: The worst thing that
can happen to a Motu (New Guinea) native is to
die with an unpierced nose. For ordinary evil there
is no punishment, it being merely undevelopment
that will decrease with the progression of the years,
until eventually superseded by full righteousness. But
to wilfully refrain from having the nose pierced is a
defiance to the spirits, and anyone so offending goes
when dead to Tageani. Tageani is a sphere where
there is little food and no betel-nut. A child’s nose
is pierced at about the age of
sevtn. Should the infant die
suddenly before the job has been
done the parents perform the
operation on the corpse, and
“prayers” are said and offerings
of pig’s fat made, it being believed
that hesitancy may otherwise be
shown about admitting the spirit
to Raka —the place of plenty. In
the case of the illness showing
any signs of proving fatal the nose
is pierced as a precautionary mea-
sure, no matter how young the
sufferer may be.
* * *
“Phoney”: I confess that
my experience with the product
of various mission stations in
Northern Australia had left me
with a strong prejudice against
their methods of “educating” the
blacks. Hence there was no one
more surprised than myself when
there came aboard our southern-
bound boat at Derby (W.A.) a
colored passenger, one “Jim,” wdio
was as likeable as Uncle Tom of
“Cabin” fame, and with much
the same manners and disposition.
Soft-toned and respectful, he made
the hard-drinking meatworkers
look quite unlike the heirs of
all the ages. Jim was on his
way to a conference at Perth,
where he was afterwards to be
used as a prize exhibit of the
refining influences of mission work.
He satisfied me, anyhow, that all
the love and labor spent in the
different trading ventures of
Christian .teachers is not wasted.
One swallow doesn’t make a sum-
mer, of course; still, it is “one
up” on the common belief about
converted Bmghis.
“R.F.L.”: A party of fishermen of which
I was one, at Farmer’s Point, Facing Island, Glad-
stone Harbor (Q.), on December 20 hooked and got
into shallow water a tiger shark which measured
over 14ft. in length and over 3ft. across the back.
While lying stranded she was delivered of twins,
and upon being cut open 49 more babies were dis-
covered. They were over 2ft. long, and were hale
and hearty, and were apparently on the point of
being born. They were a bad-tempered lot, and
snapped at everything. Is this 51 a record shark
family ? There was one undeveloped foetus. The
stomach of the mother shark contained the head,
2ft;. Gin. long, of a hammer-head shark, and lots
of feathers, apparently of sea-fowl.
* * * *
“Sax"’: When everyone was presenting the
mosquitoes with best Christmas wishes, I tried tli 1
dodge of letting them bite unmolested, it. being
claimed that they thus suck away most of the poison
they inject. It was completely successful in my
case, there being none of the usual after-irritation.
With more biting, too, there was naturally less
buzzing. Yet others in camp proclaimed the method
a flat failure. What is the Council’s verdict?
* * * *
“Jake”: “T.lv.T’s.”: mention (B. 8/1/2 5)
of stewed ’possum as good tucker recalls the tooth -
someness of another of our interesting fauna. Has
he ever tried young emu? Capture and slaughter
one about the size of a plain-turkey, and it makes
an excellent meal. I haven’t had t lie courage co
try a full-grown cock.
* * * *
“The Bale” : “Fox” wants to know about
a very large termite found in the white-ants’ nest.
She is the queen, and the body is bloated with eggs.
She lies in the royal chamber of the termitary ; the
door which allowed her entrance is much too small to
allow her exit. She is surrounded by her bodyguard
of workers, and outside these is a circle of soldiers,
•who are easily recognised by their large black heads.
She has a busy time of it, often laying GO eggs per
minute.
* * * *
“Wainui”: The Maori had a belief that
the long-tailed cuckoo changes into a lizard during
winter. Henare has often told me that, with the com-
ing of autumn, the bird loses its feathers, and the
shape of its body changes; living in cracks and
crevices, and sleeping most of the time, it thus passes
the winter months. With the first touch of summer,
however, its feathers sprout again, and slowly its
shape returns to normal.
* * * *
“T.P.”: A man here brushed a “taran-
tula” from his arm. Thereafter the limb swelled,
and, after treatment by a local surgeon, tortured him
for a fortnight, which time he spent, aided by
friends, in finding and squashing these spiders, whose
only aim in life is to devour flies and smaller vermin.
I believe the creature in this case was out for the
gore of the insect which really did the damage.
Will the Council speak a word for a harmless, long-
legged friend, wrongfully named after the European
tarantula, whose bite is s harmful to man?
* * * *
“8.5. A.” : Spilsby Island, one of the Sir
Joseph Banks group, about 25 miles from Port
Lincoln (S.A.), is the place for Cape Barren geese.
A returned soldier living there has sent out an
SOS to sportsmen to come and destroy the birds,
as they are making his holding untenable. He built
a large dam, which the winter rains filled, but the
FRENZIED FINANCE.
“I don’t know how I’m going to balance the petty eash
this time, sir.”
“Tut, tut, Perkinson, how’s that?”
“Well, sir, I swallered sixpence, an’ I’m sixpence in and
sixpence out.”
geese took possession of it, and are so polluting
the water that stock will not touch it. Flocks of
about 500 are common, and as it is estimated that
a goose can eat as much grass as a sheep, and is
particularly fond of wheat and barley crops, the
bird is no friend of the farmer. They are splendid
eating, but, according to regulations, the lessee of
the island is not allowed to market them.
THE PIG TOWN PIONEERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Now Pigtown is a pious place
Upon the River Ilogg,
Just twenty miles from Come-to-Grace
And ten from Devil’s Bog-;
And there they dwell, and sometimes die,
In sanctity and tears,
The heroes of the days gone by,
The Pigtown pioneers.
It happened, in a recent past,
The leader of the band
Came up from South and, cunning, cast
His eye upon the land.
The river flats a promise showed;
It needed but a look
To see the prospect fairly glowed
Like Canaan in the Book.
They crossed the Jordan in a dray—
A bullock-dray at that—
And sonic selected Moab way,
And some by Joshua’s Flat,
Two cousins took Zeboim Beiid,
A nephew picked on Saul —
To give geography an end
The}' got it nearly all.
They double-crossed the Philistines,
And in the land-court fights
They fixed their frequent survey lines
To block Amalekites ;
And then began, like pious men,
To marry and beget,
And as these ribald lines I pen,
Praise God ! they’re at it yet.
The scrub they burnt, the tall trees felled ;
And as they worked and prayed,
By constant impulse thus impelled,
Right good, of course, they made.
Where stood in tattered warps and woofs
The early tents of Shorn,
It. lifts to-day its iron roofs —
The New Jerusalem.
Though Huns may fall and Franks arise,
Serenely through it all
It stands four-square unto the skies,
The Pigtown Bible Hall.
There Brother Brush (who sold last year
Two hundred head of pigs)
Comes of a Sabbath morn to hear
The -words of Pastor Higgs.
And all the Brushes and the Catts,
The Cantwells and the Barrs,
The owners of the river flats,
Turn up in traps and ears;
And when the Word is rendered in
The tones of Pastor Higgs,
They group together, freed from sin,
And talk again—of pigs.
S O S.
“Shay, d’y ’ think this bloke's sober ’miff to
pick up my hat?"
A golden pig upon his chain
The elder Cantwell wears,
A sign that Industry again
For wealth a man prepares;
A token that by sowing maize
And feeding it to swine,
A man may end respected days
As father of his line.
’Twas Cantwell pere from South who came
And saw the land was good,
The Patriarch of Pigtown fame,
A Cantwell of the blood.
Three grunts for Cantwell let us give !
Filled full of wealth and years,
Long may he reign, long may they live,
The Pigtown Pioneers!
VICTORIA.

Phones Cen[?] 1522, 1533.
Memories of great soldiers, scientists,
actors and royalties entertained, of pomp and
splendors of the past, were looking for a
home at 15 minutes past 1 on Sunday morn-
ing when Melbourne’s civic heart went up
in smoke and flame. At least, it seemed to
he going up in flame, and what wasn’t burn-
ing threatened to be washed away in the
torrents of water that the firemen were pour-
ing on the blaze within a few minutes of
the first alarm. Still, when the fire died
down the fine old pile, which dates from
1870, looked just as usual, save for a few
smuts on its dignified visage. It was its
internal economy that was deranged, and the
big organ, made by William Hill and Son,
the famous London builders, at a cost of
£20,000, was a heap of fluttering ashes. Fos-
sicking amongst the embers soon after day-
break, Alberto Zelman, the conductor of the
Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, clutched all
that was left of a conductor’s stand to his
bosom. It had resounded to the raps of
many distinguished batons, including those
of Yerbrugglien and Prof. Marshall Hall.
Included in the ashes were the long line
of portraits of 16 civic heads, Mayors and
Lord Mayors since 1886. In their last
agony they were seen to turn pale, and beads
of sweat broke out on their aldermanic
brows; then they melted or crumpled up
and crashed into the flames. Luckily the
city’s archives and a later gallery escaped.
Late theatregoers watched the spectacle,
and 500 guests of the neighboring Victoria
Coffee Palace, mostly in slumber-suits with
coats or tablecloths flung over them, were
unwilling lookers-on. During a tornado there
are pears to gather, and thieves got busy in
the abandoned bedrooms. One refugee even
had her purse snatched from her.
the panic.
Where Melbourne’s big noises, including
Galli-Curci, are to find a roof until the ruin
is repaired or replaced remains a question
The Australian Church has offered its taber
nacle and organ in the meantime.
The handsome little Athenaeum Theatn
was filled on the first night of the three-ac
water-front comedy, “Cappy Ricks,” and
judging by the flattering murmurs of tin
crowd the box-office is in for a strenuous
time. The world loves a laugh, especially when
it is on the sugary lips of romance. Stalls and
circle were massed with colorful theatre-coats
and well-groomed heads. Vivid head-band-
ages of georgette made the shingled sex look
as if an aesthetically-minded nurse had admin-
istered first aid with the remnants from a
bargain counter. State Governor Stradbroke's
coming had been heralded by a red carped
blazing on the threshold—-how this touch of
pomp doth make all democratic hearts re-
joice! With vice-royalty was daughter
Helena, in blue. One of the well-groomed
heads , aforementioned belonged to Mrs.
Watson-Robertson, who had come with
friends to see daughter Elspeth take her first
plunge as leading girl. And nicely she did
it, too, in a frock of string-colored voile,
with a front-apron effect hemmed with blue,
and blue banding the neck and sleeves. In
Scene 11. she tripped on more confidently, in
a ravishing frock of orchid mauve crepe,
with a frilly skirt and embroidered bodice;
and she took her last curtain and an arm-
ful of garden stuff in almond-green. Ethel
Paige, as the inimitable Cappy’s secretary,
wore a neat little turn-out in brown with
a white band running down the side and
another round the neck-top; she ended up,
as the bride of the Cissy from N’Yark, in
cinnamon-colored silk and flounces. Manager
Frank Talbot bustled round wearing the
smile managers wear when the rush on the
box-office sounds louder than the roar of
Niagara Falls.
Mothers carrying pop-eyed infants in their
arms, with big sister wiping the nose of little
sister behind, jostled the brasscaps, gold lace
and smart chiffons in the queue two thousand
strong that crawled sinuously and to slow
music up the aisle of Hobart’s Town Hall to
grasp the hands of the O’Grady and his
womenfolk. Premier Lyons, his wife and
Ministers were there to give an official bene-
diction, but it was the proletariat that took
Tasmania’s first proletarian Governor to its
ample bqsom. The crowd thrilled loyally
when Josie Miles’s voice lifted above the
buzz the 5 home-made anthem, “Hail to Our
Land,” which had been composed by G. M.
Lobban and 11. G. Gillon; and when the
same singer released the strains of “Land of
Hope and Glory” deafening applause trod on
the heels of the last note. In a remote corner
a hardened anarchist was weeping loudly.
After the cake and tea had been duly circu-
lated the floor was cleared for jazz, into
which the O’Grady daughters plunged with
democratic zest. Vice-regal pomp, however,
reasserted itself when the gubernatorial umt
beat an official retreat between a. double line
of decorated officers of both services.
Social Melbourne still betrays with ill-
bred yawns its unfashionable emptiness.
But as the weather refuses to warm up suffi-
ciently to justify an overdraft of seaside air,
the best-known are trickling back. February
should see a brighter Melbourne, while. the
autumn race season promises a pale revival.
Toorak’s social superiority is endangered by
the domestic-servant shortage. The gay little
afternoon at-liomes are almost, as extinct as
the gigantosaurus or Mr. Asquith. Not even
our best-incomed can afford to staff their
domestic quarters efficiently ; and even it
they could there is a deficiency of dancing-
men. Emancipated schoolboys help to fill the
gap; but the older youths tend to leave the
dance field to their dads and uncles. At a
young people’s whirl the other night the
bloodless male creatures declined to saunter
through the jazz more than at most three
times in the evening, and the sweetest girls
were compelled to find partners of their own
sex. “If the wretched boys had even con-
descended to sit out the dances with the
girls,” wailed the distracted hostess, it
would not have been so awful.”
The Hawthorn Church of the Immaculate
Conception was filled to the back pews when
Phyllis Dureau and Vincent Cahill took each
other for better, for worse. A prophetic
hand had treasured up some exquisite old
lace since Phyllis’s babyhood. Sisters Lorna
and Edna and Nan Tunbridge, all a blush
of palest pink georgette fringed with ostrich
fronds, ; ’maided; and John McCauley and
Kay Dowling, from Balranald, were charged
with the surveillance of the ’groom. The
bridal party and those bidden motored to
South Yarra and 9 Darling-street for the
cake. Mr. and Mrs. Dureau received their
guests in a setting of pink blossoms and light
shades, she wearing black satin inlaid with
gold, her head thatched to match, and a posy
of red roses. The ’groom’s mother lighted
black crepe with a bunch of pink roses.
This is the latest picture of Amy Castles,
who goes off in March to Europe under
Daniel Meyer’s management. Amy begins her
farewell season on the 21st in Sydney Town
Hall, and we shall not hear her again
for years. Of all the prima donnas Australia
li:.s produced Amy Castles had the most glit-
toring artistic
success; no
other was one
of the Court
singers of
Franz Joseph
in the Opera
II o.u s e of
Vienna. For
two years pre-
vious to the
war Amy was
alter nating
soprano with
Selma Kurtz.
With four
years of her
brilliant con-
tract still to
run, the war
came to Cen-
t r a 1 Europe,
a n d artistic
uiccesses there-
in were less
than the dust beneath the wheels of a gun-
carriage. When Amy was first being sent
to Europe, she decided to include in one of
her Sydney programmes an “Ave Maria” by
pianist De Beaupuis. Early one morning the
musician called at the hotel where the young-
ster was staying. Amy, just coming from hex-
bath, rushed into gown and slippers and
nearly tumbled into the sitting-room in her
eagerness not to keep the composer waiting.
Again and again De Beaupuis played and the
girl sang. Eater when De Beaupuis reached
home he said to his wife: “I did not know
I had composed a great work till I heard
that little, untrained girl from Bendigo sing
my ‘Ave Maria’!”
Melbourne’s luckiest motorists are the
pigeon-pair and their driver whose car on
Foundation Day went over the edge of the
road on the Black’s Spur, Dandenong
flanges, and was smashed in the gorge below.
All three occupants were tossed out as the
car went over, but the scrub against the cliff-
side held them, and they scrambled back vvith
no injuries worse than scratches and bruises.
Since motor-cars came into fashion the drive
bevond Healesville up the Black’s Spur and
out has become very popular; yet, though
with its dips, heavy climbs and sharp turns
it gives more excitement than a switchback,
the road is still mainly unfenced. Surely a
Government with a proper regard for people’s
necks would have provided protection before
this.
The C. H. Hendersons welcomed Y. B.
Trapp and his popular golf-champion wife
back from their trot round the globe with
a sumptuous dinner at Menzies’. As a neat
little compliment to Mr. Trapp’s enthusiasm
for Australia’s great timber asset, the usual
flowery trimmings were replaced by a minia-
ture forest planted with lilliputian gums and
other native trees. In case the meaning
should be missed, it was guilefully labelled,
“Conserve Our Forests.” ' Among those bid-
den to the feast were the Herbert Sargood
pair, Mrs. Trapp’s brother (E. T. B. Bar-
nard) and his wife, Mrs. Walter Coldham
and daughter Sybil, the Fred Tatham widow,
Amy Kennedy, Estelle Lempriere and Bill
No all.
Here is a self-portrait of that clever little
Victorian artist, Marion Jones, now visiting
Melbourne after spending four years in
Europe. Even
in that brief
time she has
managed to
paint her way
into Paris and
London exhibi-
tions. Marion,
who is a Ben-
digo girl and
a daughter of
Mr. and Mrs.
Douglas Jones,
was a National
Gallery pupil
and before
wrapping a tra-
velling scholar-
ship round her
paint-box, had
achieved some
local fame.
Her scholar-
ship picture.
“Cui Bono?”
was Hung at the Koyai Acauemy Deiore ii
came to Melbourne. Twenty-seven English
newspapers bombarded her for interviews or
photos on the morning after her portrait of
ex-G.-G. Lord Novar looked on the fashion-
able crowd that comes to say “Haw” on R.A.
opening days'.
Melbourne begins to think seriously of
rounding off its Public Library, Art Gal-
lery and Museum. Architects’ designs,
for which prizes are offered, must be in by
March 11. Anything costing up to a quar-
ter of a million may be projected, the Gov-
ernment having undertaken to feel in its
pockets for £50,000 of the amount; and the
architects will have the whole of tlieLatrobe-
street and the Russell-street frontage to work
upon. The main frontage to Swanston-
street is complete; but recently the old iron
lions were adjudged too decrepit for any
further guard duty at the entrance. The
joins of the metal had cracked apart, and
the gaps were so big that, with a little
assistance from himself, a down-at-heel citi-
zen found sanctuary near one paw for a
precious bottle of beer whilst he went in to
have a read. He was observed salvaging his
property after the library closed.
Alex. Burnet, of Longreach, came down
from Queensland sunshine the other day to
keep an appointment with Bonnie Jean
Stewart at the Malvern kirk. Bonnie, who
was led to the tryst by her stepfather, S. J.
Clarke, easily justified her romantic front-
name in shimmering draperies of white and
gold with a jewelled band and orange blos-
soms anchoring her bridal tulle. Dolly Rowe
and Mavis Allison, in frocks of almond-green
georgette, painted hats and posies of green
and mauve, were her escort, and brothers
.Tack Stewart and Alan Burnet guarded the
’groom. Mr. and Mrs. Clarke had the wed-
ding feast at Carlyon’s, where the artistic
hand-painted name-cards, the work of Hope
Canney, elicited applause. Mrs. Clarke host-
essed in black georgette and autumn-tinted
beads, while the bridegroom’s mother pro-
vided a rival glitter of black paillettes.
The widow of the late Mayor Swanson is
floating off on an English trip aboard the
Osterley with her sister and the two young-
est Swanson daughters, Alice and Nan. The
women who had worked on committees and
otherwise during the Swanson regime used
St. Kilda Town Hall on Thursday afternoon
to cheer the lady on her way with tea and
song. Mrs. S. Jacoby handed over the col-
lective good wishes and a dressy cabin eider-
down quilt convertible into a leather-covered
cushion, and the Mayoress of St. Kilda (Mrs.
Levi), Mrs. Archie Black and Mrs. Rankine
added some verbal posies. The hall blossomed
like a shady gully with gum foliage starred
with scarlet lights. Dr. Bartolini, Mrs.
George Haines and Minnie Mitchell warbled,
and Natalie Dawson sat on the piano stool.
Does the new Earl of Oxford have to
recognise all the descendants of the former
holders of the title as part of his family, or
are the said descendants obliged to fold the
new lord to their aristocratic bosoms? If
so Henry Asquith will have plenty of Aus-
tralian ties. Several of the Bacon family
are still in Adelaide. One Bacon grand-
daughter is Viscountess Dupplin, mother of
the Earl of Kinnoull. Her mother was a
Tasmanian Gresley. The Viscountess loomed
large in England a couple of years back
when she despatched her son to Africa with
suddenness to save him from matrimony with
a widow lady.
Captain the Hon. Henry Brougham, son
and heir of Lord Brougham and Vaux, who
came by the Mooltan for a tonic of sunshine,
is cutting the dose short to keep a date in
England with an attractive American widow,
Mrs. Mac Neil, who was a fellow-passenger
as far as Ceylon. Arrival at the spicy isle
threatened to nip the romance in the bud,
but apparently absence made the heart grow
fonder, for as the ship was ploughing its way
through the Indian Ocean the wireless sud-
denly crackled and the fether thrilled to a
winged question, thrilling again later to the
right monosyllabic answer. After honey-
moon in the Broughams’ Riviera chateau, the
pair may come back to the gum-trees at the
end of next year to wander through the
great heart of Australia. The prospective
'groom has or had relatives of the name in the
Mother State; poet Rod Quinn got his ex-
perience of the mulga and the saltbush on
their Far-West station many years ago.
Mildura has been farewelling the Howitt
pair, who have addressed their household gods
to Melbourne. He will take up the secre-
tary’s pen of the Amateur Sports Club. He
comes of a family of quill-wielders in one
way and another. His mother was of the
McCrae tribe which has given several artists
and writers to this country.
Commander Haggard, the Geoff. Symes’
son-in-law, has been called to England by the
death of both his parents. His youthful wife
and baby daughter follow later.
Mitchell Tovell, who has been no detri-
ment to the Launceston Scots’ College for
the past 12 years, has now sold his intellect
factory, and will take a rest from pedagogy
for a while. He was a Brighton boy, son of a
late doctor of the seaside suburb, and a
grandson of the pioneer woolgrower, Mitchell,
of Albury, and so is closely related to the
Humes and Huons of the history books.
Mrs. Agar Wynne and her widowed
daughter, Mrs. Manser, are having a wed-
ding tea in the Wynnes’ St. Ivilda parlors
on February 20. The tea-drinking is to' pre-
lude the marriage of Mrs. Manser’s elder
girl, Peggy, and Reginald Knowles Kemp-
ton, who will be linked up quietly on the
following Monday.
Madame Buesst, who crossed to England
three years ago to take little granddaughter
Isolde back to her parents, sends a coo-ee
to the effect that she hopes to be back here
at the end o/f the year. Son Aylmer, now
conductor of the British National Opera
Co., is anxious to return to the southern
sunshine with his two small daughters, too.
Their mother died early last year.
James Burton Turner was the richest man
of Fiji when lie died in Auckland a few days
ago. His home outside Suva houses a col-
lection of island curios that any museum
might covet. The best of them he lately
presented to Auckland, where a wing is
being added to the Museum to house them.
His private collection included more than
the relics of warriors and cannibals. He
had a craze for getting hold of the posses-
sions of notorious criminals, and if you could
dig up something or other that belonged to
Deeming you could be sure of a liberal price.
J. B. Turner’s elder daughter married Alport
Barker, who owns the Suva Times, the
Pacific Weekly and a few kindred island
papers. His other daughter is Mrs. Warren
Bell, formerly of Canada, now of the U.S.A.
A note or two from Adelaide:—
S. Australia will have a feminine representative in
the Queensland Griffiths Cup contest. Napier Birks
has entered Lady Sid in his daughter’s name. The
Rymills will be the other contestants from this State.
The Mayoress’s rooms at the Town Hall have been
vibrating to the clatter of cups and fond farewells.
Prospective over-seas travellers include Mrs. T. A.
Corbin, Dr. Violet Plummer and her sister, Mrs.
Sidney Reid and Mrs. George Fraser. Mrs. Glynn
and Mrs. L. A. Jessop and their daughters and the
T. Crases are joining the exodus.
The Leslie Anderson estate has panned out at
£ 90,000-odd. Tne pile that T. R. Bright abandoned
was a mere £12,000.
After a final afternoon of skurries and ball races
at the Clare racecourse, this State’s polo ponies
retired for a well-earned rest while Mrs. E. \V.
Hawker handed the prizes they had won to their
riders. A silver rosebowl went to secretary S. H.
Ayers for good deeds done. First-prize honors in
the events that admitted feminine competitors fell
to Mrs. C. L. Colley, Miss Doris Smith and Miss
Audrey Morphett.
Another Test-match casualty was W. J. Gunn, an
ex-State school teacher, who was an inter-State
cricketer about 1900. At the time of his death he
was president of the East Torrens Club. He caught
a cold watching the hoodoo match, and it turned to
pneumonia.
The old home built close to West-terrace, Adelaide,
within a year or two of the city’s foundation, by
G. S. Kingston, has just been condemned and is
being demolished. Kingston assisted Light to lay
out the infant city, and later became Speaker of the
Assembly and father of C. C. Kingston, and it
was there and at Brighton that Charley and brother
Pat were brought up. The housebreakers report
admiringly that the limestone walls are two feet
thick, the floors and fittings of solid cedar, and the
mantelpieces marble. All downpipes and gutters
are cast-iron, and the roof has yielded about two
tons of lead.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOVES
That song-maker of all the world, Robbie
Burns, had a birthday on Saturday, and
friendly but ill-advised hands had strung in-
effective bunting around him and his plough
in the Domain against the hour of his levee.
By three in the afternoon a hantle of Scotties,
a pipe bancT and some politicians had gathered
around the singer. Surely the piercing blue
eyes of the dark-browed poet twinkled to
hear the dry-as-dust catch-phrases of the
first two speakers, obviously as familiar with
his songs as they are with Mars. But when
the third mounted the base of the statue, then
the Scot in the, front row—by his torn coat
and sun-green hat he could be picked for a
dreamy Highlander and none of your bust-
ling Lowlander —sighed with content and
fastened his thin soles a bit more firmly into
the half-melted asphalt. Around the drive
near the statue swung a motor-car deckel
with white ribbons, and in it a bride on her
way to the church. Kiddies, towels under
their arms, on their way to the baths, stopped
for a minute or two. One small boy, cap-
tured by a phrase, refused to go on with
big sister, and waited to the end, a wiry
terrier beside him. A legless soldier in a
side-car came to pay his respects —Heaven
knows through what hell Robbie Burns had
given him a hand. And all the time the
speaker who loved his poet was living again
the triumphs and the .sorrows of the man,
even to that bitter cry in the hour of
his neglect: “Jean, Jean, a hundred years
from now they will think better of us!’’
Then with a final skirl of the pipes the
Ploughman Poet was left gazing through the
blue penumbra of the afternoon on a vista of
greeny shade and sunlit lawn ; the spires of
St. Mary’s helping to create an atmosphere
not unlike that of the Edinburgh across
which he flashed in his great hour. And
one wondered if, a hundred years from now,
under some noble mass of sculpture, flying
wide the banner of his “My Army, Oh My
Army,” Australians will foregather to the
glory of Harry Lawson.
Oil-magnate Robert Waley Cohen, K.8.E.,
made his bow to Sydney Jewry on Sunday
afternoon, when the Council of Jewish
Women booked him for a reception at the
Carlton. Dr. Fanny Reading—-the grand
young woman of the Maccabean Hall —did
the honors, and clothed soft speech and
silken-smooth organisation in slim black
frocking and wide black millinery. The
drawing-room of the Carlton was crowded
with rich dresses and pretty girls, though
there was a noticeable absence of “society.”
The guest of honor and his colonel brother
drank their dish of tea at a table on which
masses of pink roses swooned, and made
pretty speeches to the members of the Coun-
cil grouped about the same board. The Oil
King is a six-footer, very broad in the shoul-
ders—rather a Norse type. Plis enthusiasm
is music, and during the afternoon Mischa
Dobrinski’s fiddle sang exquisitely for him,
and Ella Goodman raised a clear soprano
The two brothers are ardent Zionists.
Mrs. Norman Fitz Herbert, who with her
colonel husband is visiting her sister, Mrs.
Pledley Hardman, is as intrepid an explorer
as the much-discussed Rosita Forbes. She
and Colonel Fitz Herbert have journeyed in
out-of-the-way places in Asia and Africa, and
have lived months on end in Alaska. Asked
what were the greatest marvels she had dis-
covered in a life of wanderings, the little lady
immediately replied: “Beavers and the Holy
Land.” She has watched the beavers build-
ing their two-storey dwellings, and Jerusalem
the golden has her still in thrall.
The Sinful City will harbor the annual
brow-knitting of the Country Women’s Asso-
ciation this year. Last year it was staged
amid the bores of Moree, and the ladies
decided next time they’d much rather sur-
round themselves with the distractions of the
end-of-the-season bargains. Her State Ex.
will probably give the conference hey offi-
cial blessing, and the foregathering will cele-
brate its arrival in town by an evening
reception.
Visiting Sydney last week were West-
ralia’s one-time. Premier, Walter James,
Iv.C., and three of his nice-looking offspring.
Daughter Judy rushed off to Tasmania witlr
the first boat that put to sea after the strike
eased up, and father and the two brothers
were left to their piratical undertakings.
The souvenir-gatherer continues to glean
a harvest whatever the event. During the
cricket Tests nearly four dozen stainless
knives were taken from the dining-room of
the lady-members’ stand; and after Allan
Wilkie’s pastoral performance of “A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream” in the grounds of
the Girls’ High School, rows of cane chairs
vanished! As for the knives, the Man Next
Door pushes his head around the corner to
remark: —
’Tvvas passing hard to lose them,
These blades -without a spot.
There’s nothing to excuse them
Who souvenired the lot ;
That’s not the way to use them—
Emphatically not!
How did they go and whither?
To peggy-bags and grips?
Who was it cooed “Come hither”
And grabbed—like Gregory nips
The balls that slide and slither
Toward him in the slips?
Nor Monkey Brand nor polish
To keep them clean they need.
Can pumice-stone demolish
The deeper stain of greed
Upon the fingers dollish
That did the dreadful deed ?
The Professional Women Workers _ are
giving a Hallelujah lunch to-day to Kath-
leen Butler. Kathleen is the girl with the
big brain who is helping Dr. Bradfield build
the North Shore Bridge. In other words, she
has proved herself the super-secretary. She
has just returned with her chief from a tour
of U.S.A, and Britain in connection with
bridge-building. Farmer’s lounge at a quar-
ter to one is to-day’s tryst.
The irrepressible Mrs. Guy Bates Post
continues to obtain far more limelight than
her husband’s leading lady in “The Green
•Goddess.” Her latest, loudest outburst was
an impassioned address in the interests of
“our feathered friends” at the Preservation
of Wild Life Society’s annual meeting. The
lady made her points with excellent diction
and a good delivery, and was wildly ap-
plauded by the antagonists of the feather-
duster and the ostrich boa. But talking
about cruelty to dumb animals, what about
“The Green Goddess” itself? Surely nothing
is more dumb than the other actors when
Guy Bates is on the stage. The only chance
the three men and a girl get for a bit of
natural chat is when the star is “off” chang-
ing his monocle.
Bishop Alain, de Boismenu, whose diocese
is called Papuasia and includes the Strait
of Torres, is in Sydney to have an operation
for eye trouble. Born in France in 1870, and
educated at Antwerp, he joined the crusade
for Black Brother in 1895. Two years later
he was coadjutor to the first archbishop of
those parts, Louis Navarre, whom he suc-
ceeded the same year. His vicariate has 24
priests and 48 sisters, 16 of whom are Aus-
tralians. Twenty-two locally-grown girls

Herewith a Monte Luke picture of the
brilliant Hilda Rix Nicholas, taken just be-
fore her return to France last year. Since
her arrival in. Paris Mrs. Rix Nicholas has
held an exhibi-
tion of paint-
ings typically
Australian in
subject and
coloring, and
of these, the
cable tells us,
the French
Gove rnment
h a s bought
one, “In Aus-
tralia,” for the
Lux embourg.
This is the
greater honor
because the
artist was
already repre-
sented in this
national gal-
lery, as only
two other Aus-
tralian artists
are, Bunny
and Streeton. Hilda is the one sur-
viving daughter of Henry Finch Rix, of the
Victorian Education Department; and she
first left Australia in 1909. Her husband,
an Australian soldier, Major G. M. Nicholas,
D.S.O., was killed on the Western Front a
few days after the marriage.
Edith Fry, formerly of Sydney, has been
holding in London, in conjunction with Jessie
Gibson and David Neave, an exhibition of
pictures, which was attended by Lord Car-
michael, Edmund Barton’s widow, Lady
Northcote (who bought a water-color entitled
“Devonshire Cottages’’) and many others
whose names are familiar in Australia. Miss
Fry, who is now at work on a portrait of
dramatist John Drinkwater, Daisy Kennedy’s
second husband, will look up sailing dates
shortly. She feels she must come back to
her home-city soon.
Pretty dark-haired Elma Percival, of Rich-
mond, made history the other day when she
and her bridegroom, Henry Stratton Brown,
set out in an aeroplane in search of the honey-
moon. Bride’s brother, Captain Edgar Per-
cival, piloted the Cupid’s ’bus, and the moon
of delights was located at Palm Beach. The
knot had been tied at St. Stephen’s by Padre
W. R. Milne, of Richmond, and Elma whis-
pered her vows from a froth of silver lace
and snowy crepe Romain. This drew a long
train that blushed rosily in transit up the
aisle, while a veil of mellow old lace (it had
served the bride’s mother), cascading from
a coronet of orange blossoms, further charmed,
the eye. Twp ’maids, iu mauve and silver;
a small sister of the bride, in a souffle of pink
chiffons; and a miniature courtier, in black
velvet, in attendance on the principal’s train,
completed one of the prettiest wedding groups
the old Phillip-street marriage-centre has
known. Captain Percival best-manned, and
George Bryant was groomsman. The jollo
was at the Ambassadors, where the bride’s
mother hostessed in a glitter of beaded maro-
cains and black millinery. The bridegroom
comes from the Federated Malay States, and
there Mr. and Mrs. Stratton Brown will
make a home.
Sydney got another home-grown professor
the other day when L. A. Cotton, who has
been at a sort of half-way house for some
years past, was led to the Chair of Geology
so long filled
by Professor
E d g e wortli
David. Cotton
is one of the
latter’s “boys,”
and is a stu-
dent after his
own heart. He
was born not
m u c h more
than 30 years
ago in the
N.S.W. Far
W e st, hi s
father being
that Fran k
Cotton who
was in the
first great
Labor party—
he worshipped
at the altar of
Henry George.
There wasn’t
a member of that party, according to tradi-
tion, who could put things more lucidly than
Frank Cotton; and lucid exposition is one
of the son’s strong points, too. The portrait
is from May Moore’s studio.
A knot with a “Shore” favor was tied in
the chapel of the C. of E. Grammar School
the other night. Padre Davies 0.K.-ing tlie
vows. The bride was Helen Margaret Pull-
ing, of Bishopsgate, North Sydney; the
’groom, Jim Cunningham, of Lanyon, Quean-
beyan. The frocking of the principal and
her trainbearer was a symphony in ivory
and gold, and her maids wore creations in
lavender and silver. Douglas Scott, in ordi-
nary tailorings and suppressed excitement,
held the bridegroom’s hand. The toast was
drunk at Bishopsgate.
The Administrator of Norfolk Island,
Colonel E. T. Leane, squired daughter Mar-
jorie up the aisle of St. Philip’s the other
night, and at the altar handed her over to
Lieutenant E. Hagerty. Canon Bellingham
was the locksmith; and Petty’s staged the
reception.
Lieutenant Tom Taylor, R.N., who was
best man to Lieutenant Paradice when he
married Kitty Houston last week, has per-
suaded Kitty’s sister, Mona, to round off his
happiness with the right word. Another en-
gagement that savors of the vasty deep is
that of Molly Blaxland, chick of the medical
Walter Blaxlands, to Lieutenant Ross
Wheatley, R.N.
Austin Innes Anderson, nephew of knight
Kenneth Anderson, chairman of the Orient
Shipping Co., and himself one of the man-
agers of the line, did not know that, when
he booked his outward pasasge on the Orama,
he was entering the lists with Cupid. Cupid
plus Alison Lysaght, of Chepstow (Eng.),
was too much for him, and an engagement
on the high seas resulted. The father of the
bridegroom-to-be is Hugh Anderson, Master
of Cains College, Cambridge.
Lewisham put on its best bedspreads the other
afternoon in honor of contralto Kate Rooney,
when the “Blue” sisters gave a homecoming
party to the popular Sydneyite. Ex-pupils
from St. Vincent’s, Kate's old school, were
thick among the guests; and it wasn’t a bit
surprising when a Kate Rooney Cabaret in
conjunction with the Hospital’s Queen Com-
petition was arranged. This will happen at
the Wentworth on February 6, and the prin-
cipal dish will be nightingales’ tongues,
served, of course, by the homing songbird.
Incidentally, she is to appear at the yearly
17th of Ireland concert at the Town Hall.
The M.L. oarsmen who will presently
cross their bit of the Pacific to meet the
pick of the Australian eights on the Parra-
matta are to be entertained at a ball, w-liieh
Mrs. MeCree Johnson, of Mosman, is help-
ing to arrange. But not until the racing
is over. Rowing men in strict training are
not permitted such frivolities as jazz.
Two small warriors were deep in consul-
tation in Campbell-street, near Kirribilli
Point. “Yes,” said one, “but where’re we
to get the traybit?” “Well,” replied Machia-
velli, “what about cornin’ at Dr. Lucy Gul-
lett?” “Good-o,” assented the first. “She’s
sure to say”-—here his treble dropped two
tones in mimicry —“ ‘Sorry, boys, I haven’t
a threepenny; but how’ll a sixpence do ?’ ”
The Boy Scouts have a new secretary—
R. F. Bennett, old A.1.F.-er, of Melbourne.
At 42 Margaret-street, the Sydney H.Q.,
there is now a thriving Equipment Depart-
ment that supplies everything the 8000
Scouts in N.S.W. can want. Another hero
of 42 is Hartley Mac Allister: he handled
the contingent of 78 hefty Scouts who re-
presented these parts at the International
Jamboree at Wembley. These youngsters
won pride of place, and led the march on
the combined parades when 13,000 Bare
Knees from every corner of the Empire took
part.
The contents of one of the smallest cases
among the cargo of the Moldavia brought
excitement to the homes of three young
misses—M. Bradfield, Marion Dare' and
Katherine Butler. The package was con-
signed to Dr. Bradfield by Messrs. Dorman,
Long; and concealed among its soft packing
were 12 handsome specimens of the steel-
burnisher’s art, polished as if nickel-plated.
They are trophies made from the first plate
of silicon steel wrought expressly for the
North Shore Bridge at the Redear Works.
Each girl receives a paper-weight, inkpot,
paper-knife and ash-tray, the last inscribed
with her name.
The other day a Sydney teacher was giv-
ing an example of the intelligence test to
her pupils. The young Australians were
responding brightly and smartly to the sug-
gestion in the given word: “bread” brought
“butter,” “milk-sugar,” “traffic —cop.” Then
the teacher reached for higher planes. “Art,”
she cooed, and shrank before the roar of
“union !” that issued from 30 dinkum Aussie
throats.
Nichts and days in Brisbane:—
Hail Caledonia was the password at the long-
rlosed Theatre Royal when the Scotsmen helped with
a concert towards the setting up in Brisbane of a
statue of the immortal Bobbie. Agnes Kerr opened
tc a full house with “Success to Scotland.” There
was a pipe band and humorous stories about kilts,
and a Highland fling by some bonnie lassies, and
Jock Thompson of Cremorne sang “Scots Wha’ Ilae"
and boy piper McLalland, the champion juvenile
terror of the North, blew Scotch selections, and
the only thing lacking was a troupe of performing
haggises.
Sir Matthew, with H. M. Saunders in the ofßng,
saw the first day of the January meeting at Ascot.
The vice-regal tea party included the J. 11. S. Bameses.
the Glyn Connollys, Mrs. E. Iv. Tully, Mrs. Keyser
Barnes, Mrs, Cecil Palmer, Mrs. McDonald and B.
Bell of Ooochin. Mrs. Stanley Chapman was among
the smart dressers in navy with a black maroeain
coat. Mrs. Douglas Harding was in mastic and
turquoise, Marjorie Ricardo in navy and red, Feo
Beith in an almond-green coat and brown hat.
Archbishop Duhig has laid the foundation stone
of yet another church. St. James’s, Coorparoo, will
be in Roman style, of brick and stone. Five thou-
sand has already been promised towards the cost
of it.
The Cecil Palmers invited the Cecil O’Beirnes,
Mary Palmer, W. A. Douglas and others to Palma,
Rosa to say bon voyage to the Judge Shands, who
are going abroad.
Myrtle Power, of the fine voice that has been
heard on the J.C.W. circuit and at Cremorne and
Bohemia, said “I will” to Leslie Backhouse at St.
John's Cathedral. A lace and flower fan accom-
panied the bride’s white satin Paris frock. Carrie
Ruddle, in jade and gold, and Hilda Ive,
in pink and gold, ’maided. Betty Munro,
little Evelyn Fowles and Cleo Ruddle struggled
with the lengthy train, while wee June Munro, in
pink and gold, tempered the hard earth with roses.
Three hundred crowded round the wedding break-
fast at the Trocadero.
For the Anniversary Handicap day at Ascot macin-
toshes and umbrellas were the general wear until
the skies lifted, when Mrs. Stuart Murray’s ivory
silk with grey stripings, Mrs. Jack Cheshire’s pale
blue and white, Mrs. Charlie White’s cream silit
with navy and brown stripes,- and Enid North’s
navy silk and white budded out with others between
the showers.
Brisbane is to have a new club called the Savage,
limited to 500 of the brightest of our barbarians.
Meantime a really smart club , for really smart
people and not for highbrows is housed in King
House. What with the Authors and Artists’, the
Lyceum and the Older-established clubs, Foster
Fraser will be expected to revise his classification
of our capital cities in the next edition of his
Australian travel book.
For sheer audacity the thief who levied toll on the
Justice Department and certain members of the
Government deserves mention. . The legal officials
were playing a game of cricket against a team repre-
senting the Chief Secretary’s Department, captained
by the Premier. On the players’ return to the
dressing-room at the lunch adjournment they dis-
covered that their clothes had been conscientiously
gone through. Fortunately Attorney-General Mullan
was able to borrow his homeward fare from Mr.
Theodore. The latter was -£7 poorer than when lie
took the field, but he still had sixpence left. Which
sK'.-.-s that the thief wasn’t utterly heartless.

"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
Auctioned in Melbourne last week at the
instance of Wenke, the Sydney publican who was
reported to have bought him for 14,000 guineas,
Heroic was knocked down for 16,000 guineas to
C. B. Kellow, who used to be a racing cyclist and
has since made money in the automobile business.
The V.R.C., being satisfied that the sale was
genuine, has allowed the colt to be nominated for
the February-March meeting at Flemington.
Whether Kellow will get his money back remains
to be seen. This page has a notion" that Melbourne
over-rates Heroic, just as Sydney over-rated Beau-
ford. Certainly the Valais chestnut beat Gloaming
at w.f.a., but the old horse wasn’t at his best that
day; moreover, Wallace Mortlak#, who is only a
moderate, finished pretty close to the pair. Heroic’s
subsequent victories in the A.J.C. Derby and the
Caulfield Guineas were nothing to write home about.
A good horse unquestionably, but he has yet to
prove himself a wonder.
“Hamer”: Since Spearset won at Moonee
Valley on Jan. 24, he has been talked of as a .Derby
possibility. Prior to the Valley race, C. B. Kellow
had heard that the colt could be bought for £2500,
and. impressed with the youngster’s resolute finish,
he lost no time in trying to close, but Norman
Falkiner’s reply was “Too late.” Spearset is by
Spearhead—Francette’s Daughter, by Charles Stuart
(a wonderful two-year-old who did not train on) —-
Francette. It is a staying family with a liking for
Derbies, as Spearfelt and Shrapnel have shown.
No one who saw The Hawk win the
A.J.C. Challenge Stakes with lOst. 31b. would deny
him a chance in the Newmarket with lOst. 41b.
Whether he is lib. better than The Night Patrol
over six furlongs, or 71b. better than Whittier, is,
however, doubtful. Considering that Whittier beat a
very good Doncaster Reid with 9st. slb. on his back,
finishing lengths ahead of everything except Trimacre,
who had a mere 7st. 121 b., he is rather well treated
with 9st. 111 b.: much better treated than All
Siinslmie, who had 7st. 71b. in the Doncaster (he was
eight or ten lengths behind AVhittier) and has 9st.
m the; Newmarket. Friarsdale <Sst. 21b.) is the
?hly eight-stoner likely to trouble the topweights,
it they start, and there is nothing outstanding
among the lightweights, although Kidlaw (7st. 91b.)
may yet fulfil his early promise. Backwood heads the
Australian Cup list with 9st. 41b., and Lilvpond
follows ,'vith 9st. 31b. Neither has been harshly
dealt with, and the same applies to the Westralian
Mercato (7st. 101 b.), the Queenslander Seremite (7st.
'!“■) iind the V.R.C. St. Leger winner, Sandringham
(7st. 81b.). But perhaps Drongo (7st. lllb.) will
beat the lot it he doesn’t go off, as he did in
October. He is doing encouraging work at Caulfield.
Prince Tressady, who has Sst. 7lb. in the
Oakleigh Plate and Bst. 41b. in the Newmarket, dre v
attention to his prospects by his good gallop ill
the Welter Plate, with 9st. 81b. up, at Epsom (Vic.)
on Saturday. The strapping Tressady—Comely stal-
lion, though 50 to 1 in the betting, was never
further back than third, and had the lead in the
straight. Then Slianky (6’s), a gelding with a
large capacity for finishing stoutly over six and
getting weary at the end of eight furlongs, passed the
topweight and went on to win handily. The Martyr
was also in front of Prince Tressady where it
counts, but first and second are at their top, while
it. was the Tress&'dy horse’s first run for a long
time. There were inches between Intriguer (s’s),
Shepherd Queen and Answer at the finish of the
Epsom Handicap ; but in another length the positions
would hav<i been reversed. Intriguer is a queer
customer. He had run shockingly at Williamstown

five days before, but he was a soundly backed second
favorite on Saturday.
Only two of eight public fancies rolled
home at Moorefield (N.S.W.) on Saturday, and Mc-
Shortodds could count it a well-spent day. One
of the two was Peeka (Linacre —Miss Gunning;,
whose third consecutive success it was at suburban
courses. Peeka, who gave Toohey his second winning
ride (he had three during the afternoon), went out
at 7 to 4, but the disappointing Orage was at
shorter odds and carried a great deal more coin,
figuratively speaking. The Nursery proved an easy
thing, at 4 to 1, for the bi own Chrysolaus filly, Wirruna,
the first of the grey sire’s stock to win in Sydney;
her dam, Clatter, was a daughter of Brattle, a
Very good mare in her day. Ignition and The
Wraith were the fancied ones for the 10-furlongs
Moorefield Handicap, but the Positano pony,
Cesarion Chip (B’s), had a length’s advantage at
the finish from The Wraith, who was not well served
in the scramble for the turn. Polvere (6 to 4),
who won at Moorefield last month, made a good
thing of the concluding Welter, and lightened the
punters’ hearts a little for the weary journey home.
The 11-year old Bobaris, whom Perth once
thought capable of beating Eurythmic at w.f.a. has
added another flat race to his lengthy list*—the Welter
at Belmont Park. On the same day Gatwiek, winner
of the Trial Stakes, and quoted at 25 to 1 in the
ring, returned £64 10s. for 10s. cn the straightout
totalisator and £l3 Bs. on the place machine. If
W.A. tote methods obtained at Randwick, 50
p.c. of the fielders who infest that course, and some
of whom make a point of being hoggishly uncivil
to ten-bob punters when declining wagers or paying
out, would have to abandon their useless calling.

Joe Fox’s recent exhibitions in Melbourne
suggest that he is getting too old for the 20-round
game. He started willingly enough against Bill
Grime on Saturday night, but Grime nearly scored
a k.o. in the third round, and thenceforward was
always the better pug. Occasionally the holder of the
Lonsdale featherweight belt tried hard to belt rather
than be belted, and in the twelfth round he put
everything he had into his swings and hooks, in
the thirteenth, however, Grime punched him so hard
and so often that he would have been knocked out
for a certainty if referee Quirk had not stopped it.
The Englishman was still groggy when he left the
ring.
Sam Kahanamoku having established his
superiority as a water-sprinter to the Australian boys
now in the business, Mariescheh WehselaU, a
muscled damsel also from Hawaii, is showing that
there is an even greater gap between her and the
girls. In the 100 yards N.S,W, Championship at

About 7000 people saw J. O. Anderson
beat Gerald Patterson for the Australian la.wn-tennis
championship on the courts at Rushcutter’s Bay.
Anderson had defeated Hone and O’Hara Wood In
straight sets, but Patterson gave him a much tougher
argument, as the scores indicate: 11 —9, 2 —6, 6—2,
6—3. Patterson, especially in the first and second
sets, was right back to his best form, his service
and volleying being exceptionally fine. However, the
less temperamental J.O. exhibited all-round superiority
in the two concluding sets, and the Victorian lost
many points by double-faulting as his chance
slipped away. The men’s doubles went to Victoria,
Patterson and O’Hara Wood winning three straight
sets from Anderson and Kalms (6 — 4, 9—7, 7 — 5).
Miss Akhurst, the diminutive lass from Normanhurst,
was the star fan the distaff side, taking the
singles (from Miss Boyd), the doubles, with Mrs.
Harper, and the mixed doubles with Jim Willard.
Her work with Willard was extremely clever, and
experienced judges are of opinion that the pair would
be a match for any combination at Wimbledon. And
Coldham carried off the junior championship at the
expense of his fellow-Victorian Haege, who tried to
do too much during the tournament and paid the
penalty. Ooldham, however, is a very good youngster,
and Victoria can count on being strongly represented
in future inter-State tourneys when the Ballarat boy
and Haege have grown up.
'‘G.O.B.” : Although tlm football season is
still three months off, many country clubs are
advertising for representative Melbourne players to act
as coaches and help them to win matches by system
instead of by the bulloeky ways of the bush” As
the lure is anything from £6 to £10 p.w., with
the best available board thrown in, many front-
rank toeballers are leading an easy life among the
tall gums. League officials often protest against this
thieving” of their stars, and legislation is being
framed to stop it, but the indignant gentry them-
selves connive at the luring of men from other States.
During the League carnival at Hobart nearly every
prominent player in the Speck received a tempting
offer from some Melbourne club. As a result, Ivo
Warne Smith is to play for Richmond and Colin

bourne. Carlton tried hard to get Horry Gorringe.

“Shrewsbury”: The English Athletic
News recently sent its Northern Union (League)
“expert” to probe the All Blacks as to the iikelihooa
of ally of them playing the professional game in
England or Maoriland, and was told it was out of
the question. It is interesting to note how the
N.ti: game, lihable to rear its own recruits, sintie
jt. has no school tooting of ally sort, has to prey;
like a robber gull, on the breakaways and dis-
cards of the Rugby Union. Years ago, when Soccet
was becoming a great organised business in England,
the proprietary clubs were hard put to it for local
fecrUits anil had to send far afield for reinforcements;
In those days Scotland sihiply spawned fiii? Soccer
players, arid the spies of the Sohthrons used to
visit every book and coiner of the Lowlands in
search of talent. Methods of enrolment were those
of the pld-tinle leeruiting-sergeant. Plenty of beer
ql whisky and a signature to the contract and the
deed was dene. The agents were as popular with
mothers, wives and sweethearts as their military
exemplars; more than one got a father of a
doing when he was discovered, and had his prey
snatched from him into the bargain. The old-time
pro. had not the supervision and protection he
enjoys nowadays, and there was a good deal of
justification in the attempts made to prevent the
young Scot going from his native hills to the gilded
temptations of Blackburn, Bolton, Preston, Sheffield,
Birmingham and a dozen like Cities of the Plain.

Gilligan’s men won botli their matches
against Tasmania, the first, at Launceston, by 110
runs and the second, at Hobart, by an innings and
136. Sandham, Sutcliffe and Hendren made centuries,
the Surrey man’s scores in the two games being 110,
61 and 92. And in the concluding innings at
Hobart Howell took six wickets for 96. The fast
bowler’s return to form, and that of the Stiffen
batsman, will be welcome to the captain and will
make the remaining Tests more interesting if ttffi
pair are included, as they probably will be.. The
Englishmen formed a high opinion of G. Martin,
who, in the Launceston match, made 1.21 in isi
minutes, having gone in when five wickets were
down for 62. He hit 16 fours and did not give
a chance.

Although only Kippax and Scott, of the
regulars, were in the N. S. Wales XI that met
Mayne’s Victorians on the Sydney C. G., the visitors’
seven-wickets’ victory was quite an achievement see-
ing that the Ma Staters had made 614 in their
opening knock. The Gumsuckers’ first essay yielded
502, to which Liddicutt contributed 132, Willis 100
(the most brilliant effort of the match), Woodfull 81
and Hartkopf 56. Then Hendry (3 for 23), Hartkopf
(3 for 45), Blackie (2 for 29) and, Wallace (1 for
16) dismissed N. S. Wales for 152. of which Rock
got 51 and Kippax 40; and Woodfull (120 n. 0.),
Hendry (85) and Liddicut (28) did the rest, with
a little assistance from Tarrant, now very stout and
slow in the field. By virtue of this success, Victoria
will retain the Sheffield Shield for another year.
The finish came on Thursday evening, and a second
match between different teams (Ryder and Pons-
ford among the Victorians, and Collins, Bardsley,
Mailey, Oldfield, Andrews, Taylor and Kelleway in
the N.S.W. lot) was begun on the Melbourne 0. G.
at 2 p.m. on Friday, the late start being apparently
the V.C.A.’s retort to the N.S.W. C.A.’s refusal of
a postponement until Saturday. For once Collins
lost the toss, and Ryder (42), Ponsford (80) and
Love (40) gave their side a good start, Ransford
(44 n. 0.) and Atkinson (53) coming to the rescue
when three other wickets had fallen cheaply. The
innings closed for 295, and N.S.W, replied with
278, after Bardsley (65),. Collins (70) and Andrews
(54) had raised expectations of 400 at least; Keat-
ing bagged 3 for 33 arid Ray Ron 3 for 67.. Again
Ponsford (38) and Ryder (31) begaii auspiciously,
but Kelleway (4 for 35) .Mailey (3 for 56) alia
Hooker (2 for 26) made short work of the others;
and 155 was the miserable total when the last mart
was run out. Mailey bowled as he has rarely bowled
before in Sheffield Shield games; his record for ,thS
match was 8 for 159. Ryder gave the crowd a
thrill by sending Collins and Taylor back to the
pavilion in his second over, but Bardsley (59) and
Andrews (37) made a good stand and N.S.W. had
only 103 to get, with eight wickets in hand and a
good pitch to bat on, when proceedings were resumed
on Tuesday. It looked all over, but Gamble, the
fast bowler, got four good men cheaply, and N.S.W.
had an anxious half-hour before they won by three
wickets. The argument was settled in a trifle over
three days’ play, which shows that the pomp of
Test matches which last a week is ridiculous.
“Wink”: The fact that Victoria put two distinct
teams into the field for its matches against N. S.
Wales gave “Snowy” Atkinson his first Shield oppor-
tunity. “Snowy” turned it to advantage, too. When
the wickets were falling like the walls of Jericho
he stopped the rot, and his 53 in 45 minutes was as
dashing a bit of cricket as has been seen this season.
Even better than his batting was his skill on the
boundary, as there he is quite the best of Victoria’s
younger brigade. Had it been necessary, he could
have taken Love’s place behind the sticks,
for he has often Aunt Sallied with credit for the
Vic. Second XI. “Snowy” is the best all-the-year-
round athlete in Melbourne. In the winter he
captains Fitzroy, and is a spectacular half-back,
having all the determination for which his club is
noted.
“Past Grammar”: During the last two or three
seasons, the local cricket reporter has shown
a tendency to stray from the limits of the game as
laid down in the rules. Nowadays a batsman is
shown as being “thrown out,” though the rule
says explicitly and with much detail that he is
“run out.” If the recorder desires to give credit
to a smart fieldsman, he can easily do that in the
interminable preamble which now disfigures so many
reports of matches, without over-riding the regulaj
tions. Worse than that even is “hit on wicket’
(or “h.0.w.”) for the plain “bowled” laid down
by the Fathers. With pained astonishment I noticed
this last solecism in the S. M. Hekald in the account
of the Victorian-N.S.W. match. It is this sort ol
thing that has driven poor Lord Hawke off his
rocker.
ANYTHING BUT THAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
'‘Commenting on the third Test match, Lord Harris
said: ‘We lost by pure bad luck. It is largely a
matter of the toss and the weather.’ P. G. H.
Fender said: ‘lt is a great pity the team did not
have a bit of luck.’ London Evening Standard said:
‘We lost the toss, then half our bowlers, then the
batsmen were handicapped by minor injuries, and
so we lost the game and the rubber.’ S. F. Barnes
said; ‘That shower on Thursday afternoon, though
it made the wicket easier, proved fatal.’ ”
We have reached a gents’ agreement since the
memorable day
Foley’s Flat and Wirrabilly in a cricket contest
met,
And foregathered with their backers, later, to discuss
the play
In the pub at Wiley’s corner o’er the customary
wet.
First, the president of Foley’s mentioned that he’d
not detract
From his team’s superb achievement, but, of course,
they’d won the toss,
And the subsequent condition of the wicket, worn
and cracked,
Had undoubtedly contributed to Wirrabilly’s loss.
Then the vice, of Wirrabilly said he wouldn’t ha’
minded that
And to hurt the umpires’ feelings he would be
exceeding loath;
Though their ignorance had palpably assisted Folev’s
Flat,
Umpires seldom gave decisions satisfactory to
both.
Next a member of the losers drew attention to the
bat,
Which he said was twice as crooked as a dingo’ r
nether leg;
And a member of the winners said he’d eat his
flaming hat
If the ball was not as oval as a crimson emu’s egg.
Then we toasted both elevens that so gallantly had
toiled
Till the rafters shook with cheering; and the
night was nearly done
When the harmony was broken and the entente
cordiale spoiled
By some idiot’s observation that the better team
had won.
Now our oval may be patchy and our pitch be not
the best,
And there may not be a Ponsford or a Tate in either
club,
But the etiquette of cricket lias disciples in the West
And the general scrap that followed nearly wrecked
the flaming pub.
We have now a gents’ agreement which is honored
when we meet
By the gums of Wirrabilly or the oaks of Folev’s
Flat,
It permits remarks of censure on the coldness
or the heat,
And allows free condemnation of the scorers or the
bat;
Almost anything s assignable for failure or success.
One explanation only we have all agreed to shun.
Obviously it “isn’t cricket” the opinion to express,
When a match is played and over, that the better
team has won.

THE INKY WAY.
“Nimshi”: For my own part I like poetry in
tabloid form, i want to see through it and all around
it in a flash. Here is a prime favorite: —
“In the drinking-well
Which the mason built her,
Aunt Maria fell—
We must buy a filter.'’
Here is no superfluous verbiage ; and the most wooden-
headed reader cannot fail to visualise the situation,
and applaud the prompt solution of the duucuiry
presented. All, too, must admire the author’s skill
in cloaking the minor issue—whether Aunt M. is
now here, or still there. Works of genius often incite
such speculations, and, anyway, aunts are cheap
enough. Another of my favorites comes lrom
America
“He tried to cross the railway track
Before the rushing train ;
They put the pieces in a sack,
But could not find the brain.”
The harrowing thing ends there ; but I was so much
exercised upon reading it that (after wiping my
eyes) 1 got a wireless through to the editor n pair-
ing: if the missing—er—matter had since come to
light. The only answer I could obtain was “Search me. "
“The Deacon”: Just-dead John Stafford Northcote
knew newspaper production from both sides. Tas-
manian-born, he served his apprenticeship as a
printer on the Hobart Mercury, and then put in
three years on the S. M. Herald before turning
to the literary side. Five years of reporting on
the Evening News was followed by an engagement
in China on the Hong Kong Daily Telegraph.
Next came a spell of seven years with the Fiji
Times; finally, 15 years ago, he settled down on
Singleton (N.S.W.) Argus. He was 62 when he
signed the book.
“Notfarg”: William lielleway, grandfather of the
cricketer, was editor of the Clarence and Richmond
Examiner while I was graduating as printer’s devil.
Ivelleway pere was a great worker and a fluent
writer, especially on agricultural topics, and seeing
the potentialities of the Lismore district in the
’seventies started the Northern Star there. The
paper to-day is one of the most important country
dailies in the State. But old-man lielleway did not
derive the benefit he deserved from his venture, for
the city called, and he disposed of the property.
He finished up in the Government Printing Office.
“El Dorado”: Bean’s “Dreadnought of the Darling”
has ended her career, and now lies with her nose
just showing at Rotten Row, Bourke, the graveyard
of some half-dozen or more of her defunct cobbers.
Born as a barge 60 years ago on the lower rivers,
she was the prettiest model that ever graced the
Murray. Later she was promoted to the status of
a steamer, and held the position for over 40 years.
Then she suffered degradation, being once more
transformed into a barge. This humiliation appeared
to be too much for her, for on several occasions
she endeavored to drown herself. Her life was saved
a couple of times, but last year she made another
attempt and was successful.
“Hasen”: It lay on the waiting-seat in a barber’s
shop at Kobe, a violently illustrated paper, humorous,
topical and political. It was wholly Japanese, but
to each cartoon was attached a short explanatory
English translation as well as the long legend in
native hieroglyphics. Even the title was cheaply
Anglicised (or Americanised) into the Osaka Puck.
The spelling was a trifle erratic ; one cartoon showed
political factions “divissioning” the. spoils, and under
a crudely represented act of oblation it w'as stated
that somebody was “succurificing’' something. But
the label that gave me hardest to think touched on
the pet subject of Dr. Marie Stopes. This declared
that “Restriction of birth is necessary for the im-
proper increasemcnt of the title of doctors.” I’m
still thinking it over.
“W.C.T.”: Why do some writers persist in credit-
ing D. H. Lawrence with the authorship of “The Boy
in the Bush” ? Vance Palmer is the last to do
so (B. 8/l/’25). This is very unfair to Miss Skinner,
from whose pen four-fifths of the novel came. The
“Boy” was, in fact, within a few pages of com-
pletion when Lawrence visited the lady’s little hill-
side home at Darlington (W.A.), and the ex-war
nurse timidly suggested that he might look her
work over and tell her what he thought about it.
Certainly a deal is due to Lawrence for assessing
the value of the sketchy yarn, and no doubt he did
much to improve it. But Australian writers, who
ought to be the first to honor native talent, need
not divert entire credit of the book to a man
whose own works have already given him a niche in
the library temple.
“Morehead”: E. J. Brady mentions the cnly
telegram he ever received from Henry Lawson (R.P.
22/1/’26). I still remember one the poet handed
me to send. When I was a kid behind the ground-
floor counter at the Bulletin Office, an ardent admirer
of Henry’s works had sent a reply-paid request for
information about the date of publication of a
certain poem. After reading it, Henry called for
a pen and ink and wrote, slowly and almost painfully,
as was his manner, and gave the finished to
me to send away. It began: “Charlie Webb, Kal-
goorlie, or wherever you can find the crimson
blankard.” I suggested that the G.P.O. wouldn't
take the message in that form. Henry muttered an
inarticulate protest, but crossed out the last two
words and substituted “senseless cow.” I have
often wondered whether the telegram reached its desti-
nation uncensorcd.
“M.H.H.”: “Lao-Dah’s” criticism (B. 22/l/’25)
of the treatment of local scribes by the M.L. press
reminds me that at the age of 14 1 submitted a
short story to a sober weekly of Christchurch. A
week or two later I received a reply from the
editor professing his willingness to use the story,
provided it was offered gratis. He pointed out,
presumably to emphasise the generous way in which
he was dealing with me, that the mail which in-
cluded my effort, brought an inquiry from the
other end of the island as to whether they “charged
for insertion.” My youthful mind was duly im-
oressed; in those days a letter from a real, live
editor and the felicity of seeing my work and
name in print banished all mercenary thoughts.
But in later years I reconsidered my attitude, and
finished up with a migration across the Tasman in
search of more profitable fields.
“Seebee”: Harry Furniss, who has drawn his last
cartoon, once lectured at the Melbourne Athenaeum
Hall, and a yarn of his lingers in the minds of the
ancients of our Inky Way. To show the imperturb-
ability of Arthur Balfour (an Earl and a lv.G., now
alas!), he depicted an excitable Irish member asking
three questions in the Commons —(1) whether the
police had wantonly fired at scarecrows in the belief
that they were peasants; (2) whether the Government
would indict the police for murder ; and (3) whether,
being responsible for having in the force policemen
who would shoot scarecrows in the belief that they’
were human beings, he would resign and have him-
self arrested. Then came the courtly Balfour
carefully reading each question and replying that the
answer to each was “No.” In its humorous setting,
the yarn helped people to understand why Irish
members who differed strongly from Balfour and
called him nasty names did not really dislike him.
“Country Ped”: My young hopeful and his younger
sister rush the comic supplements of the picture
papers. Though the humor they find therein fre-
quently evades me, I saw no harm until the other
evening I found the pair gloating over some characters
pictured as riding on the bumpers of a motor-car.
Children being so imitative, I am expecting to read
any day of some misguided youth getting hurt by
emulating this trick. What is the use of trying
to inculcate the principles of Safety First when
such mischievous stuff is published? But last night
was the limit. Both children hurried to explain the
picture of their favorite character contemplating
suicide, which word the boy is just old enough to
spell; the drawing too truly showed its meaning.
If comic artists continue to abuse their privileges
in this manner, they will deserve to rank with
the “Deadwood Dicks” of old, and the lurid “crook”
movie-dramas of to-day, as unwholesome instigators
of juvenile delinquencies and worse.

Robust comedy, lacking the finer inflexions,
was served at the Melbourne New Athenaeum
when “Cappy Ricks” brought his ships to
port on Saturday night; and it went well
with an audience which was given many
opportunities to laugh. The play is just the
same sort of crude, shouting story of action
as Peter B. Kyne tells with success to
a large book audience, with a conventional
love interest to make weight—a conventional
love interest sustained by a conventional
hero direct from melodrama, and a girl to
fit. It gives nothing to think about; and
Saturday’s audience, being asked to do no-
thing but laugh, laughed heartily and seemed
to want nothing better —if there is anything
better.
* * * *
The irascible Cappy Ricks, who is sup-
posed to have forced his way to the presi-
dency of the Blue Star Navigation Co. by
bulldozing everybody with whom he con-
tacts, is discovered enraged by the conduct
of Matt Peisley, who, having by heroic sea-
man qualities and accident become mate and
then acting-captain of the barque Retriever,
refuses to be either superseded or bulldozed,
and brings the vessel back from Capetown
in record time with the hefty sea-captain,
sent by Cappy to make a patient of him and
take command, in the vessel’s sick-bay. Un-
fortunately for Captain Petersen he declined
to produce his papers to Peisley, and, nor
having seen them, Peisley is not guilty of
mutiny when, the Swede having started to
rough it, Peisley “does him up.” Returning,
Peisley leaves the sea and goes into busi-
ness (with the financial aid of a girl-partner

he does not know is Cappy’s daughter until
the last act) in opposition to the tyrant.
Of course the youngster beats him at his
own hard business deals in three acts,
through the dialogue of which easy-made—
and easy-lost—dollars jingle like castanets.
And finally mutual admiration and happy
matrimony, which smile upon the curtain-
fall.
* * * *
Curiosity, which had been whetted by the
entire failure of the management to make
any preliminary boost of the billed per-
formers, whose names were unfamiliar as
either American or Australian actors, was
satisfied by the discovery that the mummers
had been selected from companies touring
the Australian smaller towns. With the
material at their disposal they did very
creditably. “Cappy” Ricks himself was
shown as an irascible, conceited old man
whose real character isn’t indicated by his
tendency to froth over with shouts and in-
suits; Ward Lyons maintains the exacting
character well. As Cecil Pericles Bernhard
Donal Nicol made a success of an exagger-
ated dude, Herbert Stallard was a breezy
Matt Peisley, and Elspeth Robertson (a local
Repertory performer) did quite nicely as
Florence Ricks.
Last Saturday the triumphant Newcastle
Steelworks Band started a three nights’ sea-
son by filling Wirths’ Olympia, Melbourne,
with a large audience and the music of brass
instruments, the twin objects being to line
its own light pocket and show how it won its
championships in England. By the time the
programme was half-way through on the first
night the audience understood. The tone was
admirable, the balance excellent and the
ensemble so splendid that the sonority of a
fine organ under the touch of a master musi-
cian was frequently suggested. Particularly
fine was a Liszt item, arranged by Dr. Keigh-
ley, which had been the test selection at the
Belle Vue (Britain) contest, when the band
lifted, amongst other prizes, the “World’s Best
Band” trophy, a gold shield said to be worth
£2000; and there were some wonderful vivid
movements in Ketclby's “In a Persian
Market.” An Australian foxtrot, “Too-
woomba,” by Neil Mcßeath, was a minor
item; and, of solo items, “The Laughing
Trombone.” by Charles Dean, was particu-
larly good. The band, before it left Aus-

will carry the frills of the name-part, and
Alfred Frith will supply the rich gravy of

Ever since it started, “Cinderella” has been
running to two performances a day at, the
New Princess’s. Melbourne; and so far there
are no indications that either the energy
of the performers or the enthusiasm of the
audiences is flagging.
There has been another change of pro-
gramme at the New Palace, where the, “Mid-
night Frolics,” finishing at 11, appeal to
the suburban people who like the thrill of
the title but would shiver with horror at
the mere idea of having frolics in their own
homes at midnight. Into the new bill has
dropped Oscar Beck, a Norwegian tenor
with an appealing voice but no great know-
ledge of how to use it.
Something quite unusual in juggling is on
at Melbourne Tivoli, where Felovis is re-
sponsible for so clever an act that an occa-
sional break only draws attention to the
difficulties which-the performer beats.

Vernon is as good as ever.

“I Am the Man,” and “Worldly Goods” are

last week. It. at any rate, throbs with

Alfred O’Shea flashed all the facets of his
well-trained tenor before a Sydney Conser-
vatorium audience on Saturday, night. The
programme Avas chosen with discrimination
and served to exhibit the rich fulness of
his tone, as in the opening number. “Dai
Campi, dai Prati,” from Boito’s “Mefisto-
fele.” and its subtle gradations of. light and
shade, as in Terrari’s “Le Miroir.” Cae-
eini’s “Amarilli” showed poetic perception,
and the “Don Giovanni” encore was given
with fluency and freedom and established
excellent relations between the singer and
his audience. In brief, though the voice is
not a McCormack’s, it holds all the essentials
of success. A small group of' songs in our
native tongue included a new work by Alfred
Hill; the melody is arresting and pleasing
enough to deserve less commonplace words.
Ethel Sagasser, the coloratura soprano, had
an unusual first place in each part of
the programme; and she sang her opening
number, the Bell Song from “Lakme,” with
such sweetness and brilliancy as to win an
encore even in that unwarmed moment.
Moore MacMahon’s violin and Vern Bar-
nett's accompaniments were other features
of the evening’s music. Further concerts are
to be held to-night and on Saturday.

“So This Is London!” at the Sydney New
Palace, faintly recalls some verses Alf Aus-
tin wrote when he was poet laureate to
improve Auglo-Amerigan relations. They
featured a voice coming across the Atlantic,
long before the days of wireless :
Kinsmen, hail!
We severed have been too long.
Now let us have done with a worn-out tale,
The tale of an ancient wrong,
And our friendship last long as love can last, and
be stronger than Death is strong.
The difference is that in the play it is Uncle
of the waving goatee who crosses the herring-
pond to be comically disabused of some of his
old delusions.
Sol rises each morning brightly
From the waves where the bathers souse,
At s—or5 —or past it slightly ;
And “Ttosie O’Reilly” nightly

riotous efflorescence, will be transplanted

From the time the Six Brown Brothers
reached the Tivoli, Sydney has been keeping
late hours. The half-dozen are specialists
with the saxophone, which may be an instru-
ment of torture; but this sextette extracts
from it haunting airs of a surprising
sweetness. .Till Manners, who was discovered
by the Firm wasting her talents behind a
shop counter, sings a number of syrupy songs,
and does acrobatics on the high notes. .Till is a
game trier, and it is a pity she was lured
behind the footlights before her voice had
been sent to the laundry.
Phil Smith arid his colleagues at Sydney
Fullers’ have brightened up again, and their
newest revue, “At the Party,” is much better
than their recent efforts. The inimitable
Phil, as a butler, a dame and later an inter-
jector among the audience, is in fine fettle,
and scores two-thirds of the laughter. Linn
Smith’s Band continues to beef out jazz,
the “Mirth and Melody” of Armitage and
Hine is more mirth than melody; and the
stories of Charles Lewis are as fresh as a
primrose by the kitchen sink.
“Feet of Clay,” at Hoyt’s Sydney picture-
house, has a morbid climax, but it is pre-
ceded by an orgy of flashy scenes of fast
living. “Born Rich,” at the Haymarket, is
built on a threadbare text, and there is
enough liquid drunk during the sermon to
drown 11.M.5. Hood. “The Sideshow of
1 ,ife,” at the Empress, is W. J. Locke’s “The
Mountebank” told on celluloid. Andrew
Lackaday, the circus clown, who became a
brigadier-general in the British Army and
went back to his calling after the war, is
played by Ernest Torrance. “Turmoil,” at
the Strand, is badly balanced, and leaves one
with a feeling that the producers got tired
of their job before the finish. At the Prince
Edward “The Ten Commandments” is out
to beat “The Sheik’s record, and Mary Pick-
ford will be replaced by Fergus Hume’s “Mys-
stery of a Hansom Cab” —a home-grown pro-
duction —at the Crystal Palace next Satur-
day.
“The Listening-Insect”:—
It was an unthinking Providence that made earth
currents, the Aurora Australis, lightning and “wire-
less waves” out of the same material. When eager
amateurs put on their ’phones on Saturday night
in a million or so Australian homes to listen-in to
Uncle Sam, what they heard in their ears was like
what Tom o’ Bedlam heard in his head, and too
imaginative radists like myself expected the ether
momentarily to “look in on them with faces.” When
the loud speaker was switched on the uproar re-
sembled a German band disorganised by a small
boy sucking a lemon. In the infrequent lucid inter-
vals the platitudes of Australian Commissioner
Elder came hurtling in in such a fragmentary con-
dition that only a Hansard man could have sup-
plied the missing phrases.
This experience exposed the disabilities which
telegraphy of every variety is more or less sub-
ject to. Some ten years ago world-wide experi-
mtnts were made to discover the causes of earth
currents, which are one of the banes, and I remem-
ber watching ,in a lonely out-station in Borneo the
recording siphon of the Singapore-Hong Kong cable
slowly curving up and then down again under the
influence. The test lasted for 24 hours, and seemed
to show that the sun’s movements had something to
do with the phenomenon, which is like a mighty
inhalation and exhalation of the earth’s breath. On
the top of this slow breathing the cable signal rides
with as little perturbation as a ship rides over
an ocean swell. It is only when the movement is
rapid and irregular that it affects transmission, and
even then most of its effects can be screened.
When the Aurora Australis is shaking out its
splendors in southern skies, the siphons of Port
Darwin, Banjoewangi and even Penang in the Straits
Settlements fly off their instruments ; but this happens
only at intervals of years. Lightning is another
sort of animal. It is apt to be frequent and furious,
and there is almost always a thunderstorm raging
somewhere or other on the long route from Europe
to this country. It was an unlocated thunderstorm
that caused the fiasco of Saturday night.
Various devices have been employed on submarine
cables to sidestep the disturber, and it is usually
possible to work through the average atmospheric
unpleasantness without much difficulty. I have seen
an ordinary plate lightning-guard in a tropical station
sparking like a packet of crackers while the
instrument continued cheerfully at work. The
thermionic valve of the wireless outfit is, however,
infinitely more sensitive than the most acute of
telegraph instruments, and while it can pick up and
transmit a cough for hundreds of miles, it must
also pick up and place on record every flash of
lightning or stray electrical disturbance in the atmo-
sphere. That is why commercial wireless stations
“double up” when transmitting messages. If the
spear of the lightning hits the word when first
sent, it may miss the repetition. A lawless and
over-populated ether is the major problem of wire-
less ; but greater problems have been tackled and
solved before.

“W.J.P.F.”: Frank Charlton, operatic
oaritone, motoring with his wife and
some friends on Anniversary Day, was seized
with a spasm of coughing, and passed out
with tragic suddenness a few moments later.
His fine, open, cheery face testified to his
optimistic character; and the popular singer,
who was first heard in opera with the Rigo
and Williamson companies (1919), and later
in Sydney concert and picture-show work,
where he set a high standard of art, will
be much missed. The thousands will best
remember him for the “Kashmiri Song,”
which never staled in its innumerable repeti-
tions during the record screening of “The
Sheik” at the Globe (Sydney) in 1922.
Others will recall a vocal operatic quartet
of his. He was an Australian artist, pos-
sessing the necessary vocal equipment and
stage presence, who would have gone to the
top in grand opera but for the handicap of
limited opportunity.
“Hamfat”; Thinking perhaps that the
Melbourne Age critic had not done his full
duty, the man who set up that paper’s
Theatre Royal advt. did it for him. At all
events, this part of the advt. reads like a
terse criticism :—-
MAURICE MOSCOVITCH
In the Tense and Thrilling Modern Drama,
“THE OUTSIDER.”
“Tickets Please”; The habit of “trying it
on the dog” is coming into fashion in Aus-
tralian theatrical business. “The Lady of
the Rose,” a pretty musical play with a
weak cast, had a trial spin in Brisbane.
Josie Melville is to give “Kid Boots” its
first show in Adelaide. One suspects a lack
of confidence in Josie’s ability to rival the
success she made in “Sally” and “Good
Morning, Dearie.” Everybody who has been
charmed by the little lady’s work in Cin-
derella parts will certainly wish her luck.
“Lysander”: There was nothing about
Moscovitch’s Melbourne season to impress
him with the intellectuality of that city’s
playgoers, and if the success of Wilkie in
Shakspearean production was the lure which
brought him from his safe London East-end
and Jew York Greenwich Island he must be
feeling a bit “had.” His unique and masterly
Shylock simply slumped, and had to be re-
moved before the lesser intelligentsia realised
it was properly on. The melodramatic “Out-
sider,” with its heaving of half-bricks at a
class-conscious profession, went a little
better, but not well enough for the Firm to
risk another month of Moscovitch. Insis-
tence of Sydney upon an immediate visit of
Shylock is the reason given for the sudden
close —it is as good a reason as any other.
Yet “What Money Can’t Buy”—the play
already advertised to succeed Ragatzky’s
heroics but withdrawn —-was probably, the
type to retrieve a middling season by giving
Melbourne the sort of play it wants. “What
Money Can’t Buy” is by the author of
“Bought and Paid For,” Need any more be
said?
“Demetrius”: Melbourne as a theatre-
going community must be a. continual prob-
lem to “entrepreneurs,” especially if they tak»
their cue from critics and first-nighters.
Consider Mulcaster, who could act and had
one worth-while play; Asche, who, despite
weight and temper, is still a fine artist;
the Pounds girls and Charles Austin, head-
liners in their own sphere of London; Mos-
covitch, a genius in his special line; and
Hicks, also rated a genius by Cosmo Hamil-
ton. Their seasons ranged from the dis-
appointing to the disastrous. And Law-
rence Grossmith played to many an empty
bench —to more empty than full in "Quaran-
tine.” Melbourne’s playgoing level is Muriel
Starr, Emelie Polini, Gladys Moncrieff, Dot
Brunton, George Gee, Alfred Frith and Nellie
Bramley. In what does not much matter; the
player, especially if given a “luv-ully” part
with heroics in it, is the thing. So we have
Maud Fane simpering back from her farm
in Surrey. What is the betting that she
is not seen in a “request" revival of “A
Night Out” within two months?
“The Deacon”; A section of the Sistine
Choir is setting off on another Australian
tour. Paganelli and Faccliini will be the
principal tenors, as before, and Monsignor
Rella is expected to be at the wheel again.
Special costumes are being constructed in
Rome for the tour, which will open in
Sydney about the beginning of May.
“Stallite”: “Charlik” (B. 22/l/’25) is a
little wide in his reckoning when he refers
to “A Night Out” as the musical version of
Pinero’s “The Magistrate.” “A Night- Out”
ARTISTIC MODESTY.
"And was it actually your own creation?”
“Good Lord, no! The little beast teas always there. I merely took the superfluous
marble from around it.”
was adapted by George Grossmith and
Arthur Miller from a French farce; the
music was composed by Willy Redstone,
now conducting for the Firm. “The Boy,”
equally well known in Australia, was the
play that was based on Pinero’s comedy.
“Hamfat”: Edmund Fisher left a queer
register of bad actors. A substantial cudgel
of wood, it has accumulated names during
the last third of a century until it is now
well covered. For a merely poor actor a
small nick is cut against the name; a bigger
cut is given to a bad actor; and the worst
of mummers has a small sprig driven in
near the blazon of his infamy. In New York
not long ago an Australian dropped into a
performance of “Sweet Nell” and saw Les
Stark —an actor who, very amateurish when
in Australia, has made a genuine success
abroad—playing the old-timer who has some
reminiscent lines. In a jocular spirit the
Australian had a replica of “the stick”
made and presented to Stark at a mum-
mers’ club. The way Stark took the jest
showed that he had overcome his old stiff-
ness.
“A.P.”: Galli-Curci made her London
debut at 35. Front-rank vocalists seem to
get to London at a later age than in the
long ago. In the ’eighties there were Calv 6
(28), Melba (29) and Ternina (32). The
dazzling Malibran started in the foggy town
a century ago at 17, and her sister Viardot-
Garcia a few years later at 18. Grisi was
23, Patti 18. Jenny Lind 27 and Titiens 27.
Nowadays the fame of a Co vent Garden or
Albert Hall night is much less attractive
to the soulful young prima donna, who lives
for her art, than the pure delight .of
warbling to pork and pig-iron millionaires
in the U.S.A.
“Phillum Up” : I note sundry joyful pars,
to the effect that the gifted perdoocer
acquired by the biggest firm of Australian
picture-proprietors has “almost completed
his first Australian film.” As the gentle-
man was brought to this continent from
Los Angeles, there being, of course, no home-
grown product competent to undertake the
job, one is hardly surprised to find that the
title of the story is “Painted Daughters,”
or that one of the principal scenes is “a
bathing-pool at a large private house.” How
delightfully Australian!
“Merton”: Some members of a moving-
picture co. were enacting a street scene.
The idea was that a case of beer should
tumble off a passing lorry, comic touches
being provided by the wandering glances of
a “reformed” Salvationist as he smelt the
spilt malt and hops, and by the efforts of
his missus to bring his attention back to
the hymn. It was a hot day, and the scene
was shot to the admiration of a few loafers
and a small boy. But when the latter
grabbed a bottle that hadn’t been broken in
the fall and made off for his life, it was
too much for the thirsty actors. A conflict
of emotions was registered on their mobile
mugs. “Cut,” snapped the director to the
operator; and he freezingly addressed the
culprits. “If you gentlemen will kindly
restrain yourselves while we shoot that bit
again,” he said, “you can look in the gutter
afterwards and see if there’s another bottle
that isn’t broken.”
“Lud”: Beerbohm Tree never got off a
brighter witticism than when he propounded
the conundrum, “When is a Repertory play
not a Repertory play?” and answered him-
self with, “When if is a success.” The
rule disqualifies Eden Phillpotts's “Farm-
er’s Wife.” Produced originally (1916)
by* the Birmingham Rep., it was reck-
oned good repertory stuff —that is to
say, there was no money in it. In
March last year, how T ever, it was brought
to the London Court Theatre, wdiere, under
Granville Barker’s direction, Bernard Shaw
had become a paying proposition. The
piece has now been running nearly a year,
and lots of people think it is the best enter-
tainment in London.
“P.X.”: R. O. Blackman, Sydney’s most
enthusiastic admirer and student of Pinero,
has produced a book, called “Enchanted
Moments,” containing the most brilliant
flashes of dialogue from his hero’s 30 plays,
Blackman, who earns a crust in the Bank-
ruptcy division of the N.S.W. Supreme
Court, broke the news of bis crime to Pinero
nearly a year ago; and Sir Arthur not only
jiromptly told his old friend —they have been
steadily corresponding for years—to go ahead,
but put him into touch with his own pub-
lishers. Ileinemann. Of course there will be
an explanatory introduction. The first copies
are due in Australia in a few weeks.
“Schnorrer”: Recently, for the informa-
tion of a contributor who mentioned that a
Yiddish play had been presented in Sydney
five years ago, I stated that performances
are given in the international Jewish .tongue
several times a year. I have since learned
that the Maccabean Yiddish Dramatic
Society is to present “De Emessa Kraft,’ 1
by Jacob Gordon, at the Maccabean Hall,
Sydney, on Saturday night. The Jewish
Sabbath finishes, of course, at sunset, and
that allows the event to take place without-
violating the sanctity of the day; but the last
rehearsal has to be held on Thursday to keep
on the right side of the Torah.
“Hamfat”: I was reading a puff-par. about
Galli-Curci, a par. which related how seats
for her London concerts had been booked
nine months in advance, when somehow I
thought of Dan Barry. It was in Mudton,
which is a day’s journey by coach from
Bustedville, that Dan’s voice floated into my
ears for the first time. “This great galaxy
of theatrical stars, engaged without regard
to expense,” he said in his highflown way,
“was so popular in London that a requisition
signed by 20,000 people was handed to me
asking for our triumphant season to be pro-
longed. But my arrangements were made.
Australia was expecting me, and not even
the mighty world metropolis, with all its
entreaties, could hold me. And to-night this
great combination is here to entertain you
in Mudville.” I can hear still the wild ap-
plause that greeted him.
“Cliarlik”: A great British comedian con-
temporary with Charles Mathews and J. B.
Buckstone was Henry Compton (1805-72).
Compton’s son Edward formed a costume
comedy eo., and toured the provinces for
many years; David Garrick was his best
part. Edward’s leading lady was liis wife,
Virginia Bateman, the youngest of three
sisters—the eldest gave Henry Irving his
great chance at the London Lyceum. The
third generation is represented by Edward’s
son, Compton Mackenzie, the novelist, and
Fay Compton, the actress, known here by
the fine screen version of “This Freedom.”
Fay has just signed a contract with the
Gaumont people, who produce British films,
at the largest salary yet paid to a screen
artist in Britain. Films in which she has
scored heavily are “Claude Duval,” lan
Hay’s “The Happy Ending” and Brandon
Fleming’s “The Eleventh Commandment.”
The Gaumont output is not large, but it is
good, and its scope is to be increased, which
is good news to people fed up with the self-
conscious chest-heavers who bore us. in
Yankee atrocities,
“The Deacon”: Allen Doone (real name
Eddie Allen) has repatriated himself to the
U.S.A., whence he will no doubt let himself
loose once more on a long-suffering public.
Doone, in his relentless pursuit of the oof-bird,
made every cat in his employ catch several
mice. Even his treasurer, Frank Kenny,
son of Sydney’s veteran property-man, was
often interpolated into the interludes with
which Doone spun out liis thin shows. One
night the usual hangers-on were enjoying
a joke in the wings while the Spokane path-
riot was mashing Maureen McGillicuddy in
a “pretty” scene. Presently the love-making
was broken off. “Say, is that you laughin’,
Kenny?” Doone asked in an Irish whisper
from the stage, unable any longer to bear
the thought that somebody was wasting the
time that he, Misther Doone, had paid for.
“No, it ain’t me, Mister Doone,” said the
stampeded Kenny; but the hint sufficed for
the gang in the flies.
“E.T.”: Horace Hodges, who is playing
the John D. O’Hara role of “Lightnin’ ”
Bill Jones for the new J. C. Williamson com-
bine at the London Shaftesbury, is no
stranger to Australian playbills. The clever
little mummer was a member of the first
Wilson Barrett company. He, in fact,
started liis • career with Barrett and stayed
with that industrious actor-manager for
many years, during which he found time to
write plays with two other members of the
crowd—T. W. Percyval and Edward Irwin.
Their first piece, “Sunday,” proved a money-
maker here as elsewhere, though the author,
“Thomas Raceward” (a combination of sorts
of their Christian names), was quite un-
known. Later Irwin dropped out, and
Hodges and Percyval, under their proper
names, scored another success with
“Grumpy,” which, like “Sunday,” has been
staged all over the world. Hodges, by the
way, is not making his first appearance as
“Lightnin’.” He played the part throughout
S. Africa a year or two ago.
“First Old Man” : Harcourt Beatty very
nearly succeeded in booking rooms at the
Royal Oak, Wellington (B. 29/l/’25). Hav-
ing arrived in the windy city to play King
Charles 11. in “Sweet Nell,” with Nellie
Stewart, he entered the portals of the ex-
clusive hostelry with confidence and a toy
spaniel—which also appeared in the play-
under his arm. Just when lie was on the
point of registering, old Sam Gilmer saun-
tered along the vestibule and caught sight
of the animal. “What can I do for you, sir?”
he inquired suavely of Beatty. The mummer
just as suavely replied that he would like to
make the Royal Oak liis home during his
season in Wellington. “Well, sir,” said the
proprietor, eyeing the spaniel malevolently,
“I don’t care much for dogs, and I don’t
care at all for actors.” Not in the least per-
turbed, the jaunty “Harky” replied: “A lot
of people don’t.” Then, raising his hat with
his disengaged hand, he backed out.

A conscientious band should have,
In these progressive times,
Alarm-clocks with insistent tone
And slumberers who stir and groan,
To point “Alas! those chimes”;
A rabbit-o or bookie bawling
With raucous voice and high,
To stress “Somewhere a Voice Is Calling,”
And oh, how gladly I
Would have the “Dead March” every day
If I could be the one to say
Which artists were to die.

iHE HABIT of
JL cleansing the teeth
can be a good or
a bad one. It depends
entirely upon the
dentifrice used.
It is a bad habit to
use gritty pastes or
powders, which whiten
the teeth but wear
away the enamel and
make way for decay.
The twice -a * day
Kolynos habit—recom-
mended by Doctors and
Dentists—preserves the
delicate enamel whilst
cleansing the teeth in
the most effective and
economical way.

Murtagh /Murphy, Deputy-Commissioner
of Land Tax, who has just completed halt
a century in Vic. public service, began as
a telegraph messenger in the days when
each State managed its own posts and tele-
graphs. It has been only in the last 15
or 20 years that he has had a share of the
cake; he had the bread and water of the
service during the other 30.
“8.E.”: Touching the comfort-statidards
of some of our new immigrants. Was re-
cently staying on a' farm in the s.-w. of
W.A., where some newly-arrived Italians had
secured a clearing contract. Their total food
supplies during the five'weeks consisted of
bread, onions and salt. And they looked
as well-nourished and fit at the completion
of the job as at the beginning.
“Hopalong”: Some recent pars, about
tired husbands remind me of an occasion
when I was delivering a load of firewood at
the residence of a fairly hefty wharf-lumper.
Rudely awakened by the rattle of blocks as
I pulled out the pin of the tipdray, he came
forth to inspect his purchase. The wood was
not the best quality, I’ll admit, but I was
hardly prepared for his opening comment.
“How the ,” he demanded, “d’you ex-
pect a woman to cut that stuff?”
“Jake”: During the last few months in
Bananaland a certain amount of attention
has been attracted towards Surat owing to
the withdrawal from regular service of the
last of Cobb and Co.’s coaches and the sub-
stitution of an up-to-date motor vehicle. The
maiden effort of his Majesty’s mail per motor
car was made through mud which offered
an effective resistance. As a last resort the
bogged mailman had to commandeer a horse
and ride back for his old liorse-coacli in
order to complete the journey. How the
horses must have grinned through their
collars!
“Der Jong”: That the Afrikander fully
anticipates that the time is approaching
when Australia will place an embargo on the
export of her unique merino strain is evi-
denced by the news that Sir Abe Bailey,
the Jo’burg millionaire, has purchased. the
Tasmanian Zara stud of fine-wool merinos,
lock, stock and barrel. The transmission of
the Zara stud will mean the establishment
of an Australian merino colony in S’Africa,
where the Australian merino can be bred in
purity without the necessity of perpetually
going out of the country for flock replenish-
ment. If Bailey’s coup does not convince our
sheepmasters and the Federal Cabinet of the
necessity for shutting the door, nothing will.
Churchill in a new phase:—
John Simon, wittiest of British Liberal politicians,
said a good thing recently at the expense of “that
brilliant but erratic personality who is now Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer.” He declared that there
was “a new piece of jazz music called the Winston
Constitution: you took a step forward, two steps
backward, a side step to the right, and then re-
versed.” Nevertheless, Churchill has made the hit
of his crowded life by fixing up an arrangement for
the distribution of the German reparations payments
under the Dawes scheme. A feature that interests
this country is that Australia is to get £425,000 in
the first year and more later—that is, if Fritz
doesn’t default again. Now the newspapers publish
a story that it was Churchill’s plan, submitted to
Baldwin when the Ramsay Mac Shuffle Ministry was
on its last legs, that led to his appointment to
the Treasury, an' appointment that puzzled most
people.
“Nikko”: It’s amazing what bluffs can
be worked on the public. While a woman
and child were waiting to cross the road at
Randwick the other day a newspaper deli-
very-car swung into the kerb on the wrong
side and knocked against the child. The
mother protested, and declared that the car
had no business there; the youth in charge
retorted that it was his privilege to drive on
the wrong side when delivering papers. No-
body present being in a position to dispute this,
the woman, who might fairly have put in
a claim for damage to the child’s clothing,
at any rate, allowed the car to go without
even taking the number. There seems to be
a general opinion that a doctor may drive
how and where he likes, but this is the first
time I have heard of a newspaper delivery-
van claiming to be above the rule of the
road.
“Nitric”: There seems to be no end to
these super-sweet substances. The latest
product of the laboratory is sweeter than
saccharin, which itself is several hundred
times sweeter than sugar; a pound of
it is estimated to be equal to a ton of
ordinary mill crystals. A Japanese chemist
Furukawa, established its wonderful proper-
ties when he prepared it from the essential
oil of the Japanese plant shiso (our
perilla). Although a carbohydrate, as all
sugars are, its chemical structure is quit,
unlike that of the sugars. This interesting
class of super-sweet substances includes
dulcin, another coaltar derivative, half as
sweet as saccharin, and glucin, a hundred
times sweeter than sucrose. A. new chlorine
compound is 300 times sweeter than the
C.S.R.’s output. Curiously, a slight change
in the constitution of the molecule of this
compound produces an intensely bitter sub-
stance.
“Machete”: No less than nine traders were
fined at Newtown (Sydney) on a recent
morning for giving short measure or light
weight. They included grocers and other
shopkeepers, as well as a milkman and a
wood-and-eoal merchant. The highest fine
was £5, although it is quite likely that the
profits in some of the cases would have made
a £5O penalty negligible. Short measuring
and snide weighing are getting a lot too
common. “Leaning” on the scales is a favor-
ite trick; I recently watched an Italian
gentleman trying to make half a pound of
mushrooms weigh a pound by this method.
The scales were in an obscure corner behind
the counter, where our Latin and Greek
shopkeepers usually put them. Three or
four attempts to keep the buyer’s end of the
scales down failed so conspicuously that
the manipulator went through the motions
of adding more mushrooms, and he was just
turning round with the bag when he saw he
was being closely watched. The industry
with which he proceeded to put something
approaching correct weight in the bag was
humorous. Nineteen buyers out of 20 don’t
know when the man they are dealing with is
a convicted swindler and must be watched.
They ought to be warned of it: every con-
victed thief, ought to be obliged by law to
keep a notice of his conviction posted on
his window for six months.

Correct Street Lighting
Adds Beauty
MANY of the inventions of man mar nature’s beauty. This
is not true of Electric Light. It brightens the dark cor-
ners of the city and brings pleasure to the heart by its efful-
gent glow. It is man’s substitute for sunshine, a light without
waste, entirely consuming the force that feeds it.
The Westinghouse engineers, not content with giving elec-
tricity for utility alone, have also embellished the mediums
through which it is furnished to harmonize with their sur-
roundings and fit into the picture as something beautiful be-
sides useful. This was the thought that led to the adaptation
of the graceful Corinthian columns for street lighting.
Westinghouse street lighting is a system of correct and
ornamental illumination.
In arranging for the distribution of its products in Australia, Westinghouse will be
pleased to hear from firms interested in acting as* distributors.

FARMERS SHOULD NOTE THAT
“CLETRAC” has stood the test of
time! —proof positive of its lasting
qualities and mechanical excellence. But
it is in performances that “Cletrac”
has such amazing advantages over
others. A Tractor that replaces 8
horses on the farm, works 365 days
annually, if necessary, and runs on
kerosene —at half the cost of horsefeed
—is an asset to any farmer. These
accomplishments are only part of
“Cletrac’s” utility. Pumping water —
cleaning tanks—sawing wood —thresh-
ing grain and hauling are all jobs that
yield to the “Iron Horse that Never
Tires.”

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
B. Aim: If you value your life don’t send
a newspaper such eloselv-typed stuff again. Some
offices keep a gang of men specially to kill con-
tributors and correspondents who commit this
atrocity... .R.E.8.; Some dreadful lines ; for example,
“It needs, therefore, in consequence”... .Parish
Clerk: Too trivial.... Brum: According to the latest
figures in this office (mostly 1922-23) steam is still
more used in Australian factories than electricity—-
steam 55 p.c.; electricity, 33 p.e. Gas, oil and
water (4 p.c.) account for the balance... .J.X.:
(and 200 others): The ring has been kept for
Bedford and Grist... .C.L.S.: Well, why shouldn't
Bedford be an M.P. “out here”? Jones is an M.P.
in there.... Tv.: But at least five-sixths of Bulletin"
readers wouldn’t have seen the original article. .. .
Fergus G., R.M.S., Old Shako: Glad we don’t have
to use... .C.Q.: One verse knocks loud:
Young men that were in Grandpa’s day
Worked harder then than we do now.
They never drank nor spent their pay;
(They often wished they could, I trow).
But when they got their weekly screw,
They carried it straight home to ma.
Now! that’s a thing we seldom do,
We’re not so good as was Grandpa.
....Fishguard Bov: Dan Morgan was borninN.S.W.
in 1831 and was shot by John Quinlan, at Peechelba
station, 20 miles from Wangaratta, on April 9, 1865.
G.S.A.; The matter is slight and ihe shape a
bit untidy... .V.M. (Burnie) : Doesn’t get to any-
thing D.P.M.: “Virgil” is so nearly good that
you should make it entirely so. The metre will not
stand all that straining... .G.A.L.: Your rain is
rather mirthless water... .8.D.T.: They are too
slight and frail.... Jake: Hasn’t enough force
8.1. K .: Not for us H.C.H.: It’s a very ordinary
remark, but why write it to look like verse?....
Twilight: They don’t get near. .. .W.R.D.: Too
thin... .A.R.N.: Falls far short. .. .P.J.R.: Not
quite L.V. (S.A.) : Very dreary. .. .liid M.: It
doesn’t make much of a yarn.... Mary H.: Poor
stuff.... Learner: Doesn’t quite work 0ut.... E.M.E.:
“The Brow” misses. . . .L.H.R.: Both fail. . . .W.F.J.;
No, it is not poetry. It is commonplace tortured
into verse... .R.S.: That sort of thing is too easy
to do well, and no doubt for that reason has been
worked to death. .. .G.A.D.: You set the scene, but
your characters have nothing to say....H.M. (Port
Melbourne) : The method is new and the verse original:
He believes in total sobriety
And will talk about early piety;
He is fond of his own notoriety,
This erratic man known as Worn Talsh.
He has a peculiar method of treating
His disciples by stopping their eating
And proclaim a very big meeting
To hear the rich voice of Worn Talsli.
He has travelled in many districts,
And knows all about weevil.v biscuits,
And will talk quite a lot of statistics,
This marvellous man Worn Talsh.
He likes you to think of his heroism
Of the martyred man when in prison
When quoting of government with derision,
This Bolshevik man Worn Talsh.
. ...A.L.D.: They imitate a good deal and the ideas
are young and extravagant; but if that is your age
there is hope for you... .Callan Park: The adventures
of Miss Insomnia leave us cold; but it might be
sold somewhere else. ... Scherzando: Not quite well
enough done; and “ate” is not pronounced “et”....
Reg B.: The verse is pretty horrible, as any verse
must be that begins by trying to rhyme “clean”
with “being”. .. .Coaster; “The Blue Wren” deserves
something better than to have such jagged verse
hurled at it. .. . Alastor; It has the lumber and jolt
of a bullock-waggon loaded with all the flowers of an
aboriginal muse.... Jayem: We don’t want to dis-
courage you, but the lines couldn’t be much worse.
....Bellerive: That’s the stuff, with a real punch
in it:—
“Shiver my timbers,” cried a tar,
“Your hellish pranks we’ll check,”
When -the brutal captain felled a lad
Aboard, the vessel’s deck.
“Darn you for a mutinous skunk,”
Was the frenzied chief’s reply,
When upon him pounced the crew—
He’s time had come to die.
Fiercely for lie’s life he fought,
But he’s efforts were in vain ;
They hurled he’s bleeding carcase
To the reptiles of the main.
The captain’s grim and sudden end
Did doom the tossing ship ;
The stricken wretches realised
She’d never brave the trip.
Lost upon the trackless surge,
As clouds above did frown,
The winds wailed through her riggings
As she foundered and went down.
....Alfred D.; Not enough in the “chows” for us.
. ...S.W.P.: Not much demand for that sort of
thing here. .. .H.P.R.: The yarn is not thrilling and
the handwriting almost got us down... . Riverina:
Wants revising and is worth it ... .E.A.8.: Doesn’t
strike us hard enough.... K. S.A.: It seems to lack
sincerity... .Paula V.: No mirth in it.... A.D. (Haw-
thorn) : “Restitution” is too bald a narrative to hold
much interest.... Marco: Should have smarter hand-
ling'; might be worth while then....F.W. (Chats-
wood) : Well enough told; but so 01d.... Lesley W.:
As thin as the hound of Lazarus.... Z. V.W.: “Ted’s
Mother” is too frail.... J. 5.8.; Sorry, not much
improved.... Fawks P.: Poor sort of yarn with no
particular point. . . .S.E.L.: Nothing there. . . .R.N.W.:
You are wrong in your dates; Marmion was not
W.A. Minister for Mines “when the 1895 boom set
in” ; Wittenoom held the job from Dec., 1894, until
1898. And several State batteries (not merely
public batteries) were crushing long before Gregory
became Mines Minister; the Tuckanarra (Murchison)
plant, for instance, was officially opened in March,
1899... .Perth, W.A.: It is not necessary for a co.
to be registered in any State to claim for debts
contracted in that State. But a creditor in one
State has no garnishee rights over the wages of a
debtor, even if the debt has been contracted in that
State, who receives his money from another.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
S.M.: Almost anyone of the same age could have
done it....G.W.: Your constable is easily amused.
Perhaps he hadn’t heard the joke a million times
before... .T.W.: We can’t tune-in to any of
them.... E.H.: If the ship isn’t a toy ship and the
parsons aren’t dwarfs, your lady is at least 12
feet high. She is also considerably out of drawing
in various nooks and corners. There is no market in
this office for badly drawn female colossi at present.
. ...L.McR.: Diagram of a fence bisecting three
uninteresting people into two equal parts; the fence
obviously introduced to conceal your inexperience
of hands and feet. It isn’t a fince wc would take
a long tram-ride to see, either. .. .L.MeK.: What
mausoleum did you rifle for that moon-sun jest? And
what is the semi-circle, anyhow?... .C.H.C.: We can
almost smell the drains in that back yard H.H.:
Idea doesn’t quite tempt us.

Our Auditors’ Certificate
is given here—
BRISBANE. 18/12/24
We certify that we have
counted the suggestions in
connection with the REX
CAMP PIE COMPETITION and
the Number is forty six
thousand two hundred and
Public Accountants.
It speaks volumes for the wonderful
popularity of Rex Camp Pie when
such wonderful response was given
to our request for suggestions for a
new name to replace Rex Camp Pie.
The result surpassed all our expecta-
tions.
Owing to this phenomenal response, it will be
necessary for us to postpone the announcement
of the judge’s decision to March 31—this year.
HOUSEWIVES know full well that Rex Camp Pie is the only genuine article
1 being made from a secret recipe solely in our possession. It has won its
way into thousands of Australasian homes. The reason is that the raw materials
in all “Rex” products are superior to those used in any factory in the world,
iJ.JL Ull iVVA J.
and there is nothing Tacking in skill and experience in their preparation.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Tarago”: Fritz has travelled far along
the trade route since he ceased supplying
our burial squads. The other day in a
“Diggers’ hairdressing saloon” I noticed a
pile of razors in the window with the legend
“Real German Hollow-ground Razors” in
gold lettering on the cases. And the Repat.
Department had supplied the money for the
stock!
* * * *
“Fordson”; “D. Mac’s” fill Is. 7d. from
65 cows may be somewhere near a record
for a midsummer month; but it is no-
where near the size of the cheques dairy-
farmers got a couple of years ago, when
butter was 2s. 4d. per lb. I don’t know if
it’s a record, but my dad made £ll7 from
32 cows one month, and I think others made
as high as £4 per cow.
* * * *
“Roundsman”: Only one of the 278 Vic-
torian bankrupts who iiled schedules last
year described himself as “a gentleman.”
Possibly he was as near the truth as the
companion in misfortune who wrote himself
down “an entertainer.” The list of failures
was beaded by laborers (22) ; close up were
builders (18), and then cab- and car-drivers
(11). There were no politicians or news-
paper editors. Apparently nobody would
trust them.
* * * *
“Hawser” : What looks like being a world's
record tow will begin shortly, when two
Dutch tugs will start to drag from Adelaide
to Rotterdam tiie City of Singapore, which
was gutted by fire at Port Adelaide last
April. The City is engineless and practi-
cally an empty shell; the pull is estimated at
13,000 miles. But they reckon that nearly
double the towage bill will be saved by hav-
ing the vessel reconditioned in Holland in-
stead of Australia.
* * * *
“7PN”: The other day when Theodore
officially closed the railway gap between
Townsville and Cairns, the usual statisti-
cally-inclined person arose to remark that
ffie longest one-way ride now procurable in
Australia was from Chillagoe (Q.) to Meeka-
tharra (W.A.). Actually, the rails go on
past Chillagoe a few hundred miles to
vmarleston, formerly Finnigan’s. I don't
know who Finnigan was. Possibly he kept
a pub once. Anyway, the place was Finni-
gan’s for about 40 years before it was
Charleston.
* * * *
“Sturt” : The motor-’bus is receiving lots of
backing in S. Aus. The Adelaide Tramways
Trust, finding the opposition of the privately-
owned ’bus serious, is considering a fleet of
ils own to run outside the area of the tram
lines. Also Webb, Chief Railways Com-
missioner, has accepted tenders for a fur-
ther batch or them, admitting frankly that
thousands of people seem to prefer road to
rail these times. But how the Commissioner
is going to pay the interest or wipe off the
debt on the railways by catering for that
preference isn’t obvious.
* * * *
“The Oyster” meets an old friend:—
Anchored in Salamander Bay—the deep-water inlet
in the south shore of Port Stephens, which once
upen a time was to have been a naval base—float
two dismantled hulks; a third reposes on the bottom,
with no hope of resurrection. The last is all that,
remains of H.M.S. Psyche, recently towed to the
spot to ■ do the work the survivors still carry
on as repositories for piles and other big timber
which are periodically hoisted into the holds of
steamers and transported oversea. One of these two
is what is left of the old paddle-steamer Brighton,
which for about 30 years voyaged between Sydney
Cove and Manly as the crack vessel of the Port
Jackson Co.’s fleet. • Her two funnels and big paddle-
boxes were as familiar to wayfarers along Our
Beautiful Harbor as Pinchgut; the sight of her
the other day, minus both these characteristics,
recalled a period when a tin bucket and a wooden
spade on Manly Beach meant ever so much more than
a visit to the surfsheds does nowadays. It is a sad
ending to an honorable career; still to finish up in
the midst of some of the most beautiful scenery in
Australia is a better fate than has fallen to the lot
of many a crack clipper now peddling' coal"in"bailin'*
Harbor and Woolloomooloo Bay.
A SARTORIAL BAROMETER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A flippant world has dubbed them Brown.
They live next door to me;
And past my window, up and down,
’Their kids race joyfully.
Young Jimmy has some brand-new pants,
His face is wondrous clean;
A new frock helps to light the glance
Of five-year-old Irene.
And so I guess their old man’s got
A decent job to foot that lot.
Alas, those pants have lost their sheen,
And Jim sits on a patch ;
But still his face is wondrous clean,
Well combed his ginger thatch;
And ironed well is Reny’s dress
(It seems to hide the mends).
Yet somehow now I seem to guess
. All good jobs have their ends.
But Mrs. B. with hope is “bright—
Those kids are still a pleasant sight.
Tiie weeks on leaden feet go by.
Jim’s grubby face is thin;
His tattered trousers make me sigh—
Oh, thank God for that pin!
And Irene’s curls are tangled now—
She’s on the downward slide;
Her ragged dress the fates allow
Her form somehow to hide.
Once more their message com-is to me—
All hope 'lias died in Mrs. B.
Then 4 lo! upon a sunny day
Jita’s gay voice fills the air t
His tattered breeks have slunk away; \
He boasts a brand-new pair.
Miss Irene’s hair is curled and bright,
Her new frock is a dream.
Again they make a pleasant sight,
Their smiling faces beam.
I read the message through my pane—
Their old man’s working once again!

FIFTEEN New Studebaker cars are now being
shown throughout Australia and New Zealand.
They embody entirely new features of design. They
set new standards of performance. They offer increased
comfort. And they establish motor car values which
are without precedent.
The Duplex—an entirely new-type car
Originated and developed by Studebaker —the new
Duplex body combines the airy free-
dom of the open car, with the protec-
tion and comfort of an enclosed car. Yet
at the price of an open car! And with-
out the added weight or cost of a closed
car. The dual advantages of the Duplex
body are obtained by overlapping roller
enclosures, which make it possible to
convert the Duplex from an open into
a closed car, or vice versa, in thirty sec-
onds. Simply raise or lower the en-
closures without leaving your seat. This
is an exclusive Studebaker feature.
Beautiful Ne<w Design
All the new Studebaker models are dis-
tinguished by high, nickel-plated radia-
tors; straight bonnets; and broad, deeply
crowned mudguards. All models are
equipped with full size balloon tyres. A partial list of
equipment features includes: tyre carrier with lock;
combination stop-and-tail light; automatic windscreen
cleaner; glare-proof visor; foot-operated cowl ventilator;
gear box lock; large massive headlights, and a one-piece
windscreen. Instruments include 8-day clock, speedom-
eter, petrol gauge, oil pressure gauge and ammeter.
They are mounted under glass in an oval group.
Lights are controlled by a lever on the steering wheel.
In 30 seconds —
The Studebaker Duplex can be
changed from an open to an en-
closed car or vice versa. Simply
lower the roller side enclosures —
without getting out of the car. This
is an exclusive Studebaker feature!
Greater Power Finer Performance
The world-famous six-cylinder Studebaker engine—in
unit with the clutch and gear box —is even quieter,
smoother, more flexible and more powerful than ever
before, Advanced design, plus careful workmanship
and the finest materials assure conservative operating
costs. All surfaces of the crankshaft are perfectly ma-
chined to exact dimension and balance. The newly
designed force-feed oiling system provides maximum
lubrication efficiency.
New Ease of Operation
Easier gear changing; new clutch action;
new steering gear, especially designed
for balloon tyres; larger, more powerful
2-wheel brakes, with 4-wheel hydraulic
brakes of an entirely different design,
optional at a nominal extra charge.
New type emergency brake is operated
from the dash.
Greater Comfort —Greater Value
The new Studebaker cars are longer and
roomier. Especially designed springs
and deeply stuffed, genuine leather up-
holstery co-ordinate with balloon tyres
in giving maximum riding comfort.
Added to their other qualities, the new
Studebaker cars offer remarkable motor car values.
The £12,000,000 Studebaker factories which man-
ufacture these cars complete, eliminate the profits
of middlemen and thus make possible the unparal-
leled values offered by the New Studebaker models.
The new Studebaker is here today! And no matter how
sweeping your ideas of what a motor car should be,
this car will satisfy you. See the new Studebaker
cars today!

“Table Salt”: Apropos of a controversy
at present agitating longshoremen as to
when wire rigging was first used on sailing-
ships. Can any real salt tell me how many
ropes there are on a full-rigged ship?
Clara Sophia Sweet, just dead at the Old
Colonists’ Home in North Fitzroy (Vic.), was
a daughter of Captain Francis Barnfield,
who was a surveyor with Colonel Light, the
man who laid out Adelaide in rectangles
and gave it a girdle of parklands.
“Stellsby”: Re parsons and ex-parsons. A
Melbourne solicitor wearied of piloting briefs
to the Stryvers of Selborne Chambers, and
took to piloting souls heavenward instead.
He stuck to his new calling for awhile, then
had a row with the Archbish., unfrocked
himself and reverted to the pursuit of Costs.
Richard Harding, the dressy young man
who came to Australia in ’22 as secretary
to the British Cotton Delegation, and wrote
the voluminous “Cotton in Australia,” has
taken to purchasing the fluffy stuff instead
of writing about it. As buyer of raw cotton
for George A. Bond, the pioneer Australian
cotton-spinner, he will operate in Queens-
land.
“8.8. C.” : The Lithgow (N.S.W.) pair who
celebrated their golden jubilee lately must sit
behind Mr. and Mrs. R. White, of White’s
Hill, Brisbane. Married one Christmas Day.
at 18, this pair are now 80, and during 60
years ,in Queensland have called in the
doctor only once ; that w r as when one of Mrs.
White’s sons arived in a tent while her hus-
band was away.
A. E. Hefford, who comes to M.L. as the
new Government fisheries expert, is a noted
English authority on piscatorial politics.
For the last nine years he has devoted his
attention to fins, fresh and salt, with occa-
sional incursions into shells. After holding
several important posts in England—he is
M. Wales —and being loaned abroad, he
has accepted the M.L. offer to look after the
destinies of its hapuka and rainbow trout.
If H. E. Winterbottom, secretary of the
Chamber of Manufactures in Adelaide, were
cast up on a desert island he would organise
a show of shellfish. In his younger days
he lent a hand to run the city’s annual shows.
During the w r ar he helped with “Australia
Days” to bring half a million pounds into
patriotic funds. Now he is getting down to
the huge task of organising the big All-
Australian Exhibition which is to open in
the Churchy City in 1925.
“Jobber”: Sydney Telegraph states that
newly-appointed Chief Justice Street, who
was born in ’63, is of the fourth generation
of Australians on one side and of the fifth on
the other. My paternal great-grandfather
arrived on the Sirius as an officer of the
102nd Regiment in 1788. I was born in
’B3, and am hence of the third generation
of the native-born. If Justice Street is 20
years older than I, and is of the fourth, they
must be much briefer generations, for his
forebears couldn’t possibly have been here
before mine.
Records? A lady known to the Brisbane
police as the North Quay Mermaid made
her 311th appearance the other day. The
P.M. let her go on the understanding that
she would take the pledge. The Newcastle
(N.S.W.) police have a client whose score
(although not quite so good as the Brisbane
Mermaid's) knocks out Ryder’s—it is some-
where near 270. When she appeared for the
201st time she asked for a discharge—“l
was celebratin’ me second century,” she said.
The Law smiled. It is an easily amused ass.
Launceston lost a good citizen when 81-
year-old Robert Bennell died. For 50 years
he was a member of the Launceston Fire
Brigade and for 25 was superintendent.
Many good saves were due to his work. When
the steamer Flinders caught fire outside
Tamar Heads, the brigade and its plant
were taken down in the tug Tamar, and got
the better of the fire just when the skipper
was preparing to scuttle the ship. Yet fire-
fighting was only a side-line of his: his
father set up a house-decorator’s business in
the town’s earliest days, and his boys carried
it on.
“T. 0.1.”: A propos the Romance of Gold
(B. 15/1 /’25). While Edmund Hammond
Hargreaves was battling for a pension, I was
deputed to obtain a photograph of the old
gold-finder for a weekly paper. I found
him in lodgings at Forest Lodge, bed-ridden
but far from feeble. Shortly afterwards
a pension of £250 a year was awarded him
by the N.S.W. Government. He had re-
ceived some thousands of pounds years before
in Government rewards for his discoveries
in N. S. Wales and Victoria; nevertheless,
but for the pension he might have died a
pauper.
“El Verdugo”: The Territory is talking
of nominating R. W. Mallam, the leading
solicitor in Darwin, to supplant Harold
Nelson in the House of Reps. Mallam is a
kind soul with a bitter tongue, who keeps
much to himself in private life. No lost dog
or liard-up human is in need of a practical
friend when Mallam is about, and no poten-
tate lacks a nickname. One ruffled dignitary
who is known far and wide as the Pink
Mouse is said to owe his sobriquet to him.
Mallam long stood behind the Labor party,
but he isn’t so sure of it nowadays, and if
he enters the House he will probably stand
upon a non-party platform, of which self-
government for the North will be the essen-
tial plank.
Rev. E. R. Carpenter, Th.L., who has just
been ordained and given the job of Registrar
of the Diocese of Riverina, is a Melbourne
young man who should make a popular and
liberal-minded addendum to the parsonry of
N. S. Wales. While swatting up the Flood
and the Ten Commandments he supported
life by driving a quill in the Vic. Railways
Dept., incidentally keeping his hand in by
assisting Father Barclay, son of novelist
Florence, to sprinkle the incense at Ex-
tremely High St. John’s, in Latrobe-street.
He whs a simple footslogger in France, and

ftalSral “"Beauty
lo Shin and Hair!
That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot be imitated can bo
obtained by regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary toilet
soaps do not assert this influence. Many of them contain free alkali, which
tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the best ot such
soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin. _
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing, antiseptic balsams as
Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment of skin affec-
tions is known throughout the world. Simply use Rexona Skin and h acial
Soap regularly once or twice a day, and see if it does not quickly soothe and
cleanse the pores, lessen the tendency to pimples, and leave the complexion
clear, fresh and velvety.

GREEN.
WHERE the young grass was greenest
and the shade
Wrapped us about with secrets
we would lie
Close locked, nor heed the flying hours,
Watching the thread of sunlight which had
strayed
Across your hair, was thrilled and half-afraid
To see its brown turn flame. Above us high
Through the dim vault of trees the waiting
Called'us in vain from our enchanted glade.
Then was the Earth a green one and the days
Aglow with wonder at the spell we wove
To shield our love from harm—the wizardry
Of Youth a-courting in the flowery ways
Of Spring! Dear heart, how well we jearned
to love „ ,
When all the World was green for you and
me!
GREY.
Dull little hopes, which never dare to dream
That they will know fulfilment melodies
In minor'key and vagrant memories
Of small things half-forgotten —a dark stream
Of phantom shadows in the misty gleam
Of lamplight through the rain and reveries
In silent woods when dusk is on the trees.
Grey are these things—grey as my heart
they seem.
Rain on the roof; and dripping from the
eaves
Your small voice throbs and moans its weary
dirge,
Crying for grief and fear as once I cried.
Almost I envy those wet-shining leaves
Stroked by your gentle hands and long to
merge
My grey heart in that mournful world out-
side.
BLUE.
Blue of the valleys, infinite and still,
Color of dreams —the dreams of those who
wait
Knowing that beauty only, soon or late,
Slow, silent and omnipotent, can fill
Man’s sad heart utterly; blue of the hill
Always beyond—beyond; blue of the great
Untrodden land which none may desecrate —
The mind of childhood without thought of ill.
Blue of the valleys, luminous and strange!
Our little lives are nothing to your spell;
As the blown wisps of cloud we vanish too.
Vast mystery beyond our groping range
Of sight and understanding, we do well
If we but learn the glory of your blue!

P. O’R.
The Crossing-over of War Sang.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AMBITION was in the blood of War
Sang. Had he been content in his
own beloved China, or even in Canada,
all would have been well. But War Sang
desired to live in the United States of
America, where there was wealth for all, if
the tales were true that drifted out from the
Chinese already there, and where every man
could become a citizen of the country.
In vain his friends tried to make him
change his mind. The perils of crossing
over the border would be great, they said.
War Sang agreed and smiled. Had not he
and six others laid under the coal of a tramp
steamer, breathing through a reed, and only
been dug out twice to be fed during the long
voyage from Hong Kong to Vancouver?
What could be harder than that? There
were wealth and honor over there, under
the Stars and Stripes. They were worth
risking much to get. And there was the
future too. War Sang half-closed his eyes
as he dreamed of the future, when he would
be a citizen of the United States, with a
wife and family: when his childi'en would
be American-born citizens, fit to hold the
highest post in the land. War Sang scarcely
dared even to think of his great dream—
that some day a son of his might be Presi-
dent of the United States.
The smugglers of men told War Sang and
the other three Chinese who wanted to cross
that it would cost them each 500 dollars., cash
down. And they must swear to obey every
order and submit to whatever hardship came
without crying out. They promised.
For days they rode in a closed motor-
truck, right across the plains and mountains,
down to the great lakes, for the border would
be crossed by water, and at night.
It was cold on the lake shore. Wind with
an arctic edge to it swept across the sea of
fresh water, making their teeth chatter. They
were a little sad, too, for the bootleggers told
them that here they must separate. They
were to cross in fishing boats, each fisherman
taking one Chinese; but they would be able
to meet again at an address which was given
them where a countryman of theirs kept a
chop-suey joint at Duluth. They savvied.
Anything would be better than standing,
chilled to the bone, on the cold shore of Lake
Superior.
A fishing-boat with a quiet engine swung
out of the gloom and pushed her bow up on
the beach. War Sang went first. The fisher-
man helped him aboard and told him to go
down into the cockpit, out of the wind. The
boat slid away, heading south for the Ameri-
can side, her engines running very softly,
for the Customs officers were very vigilant
here. It would be a long trip, but once they
were over the dangerous part the engines
would be opened out and the boat would
show her heels.
The fisherman talked with War Sang. He
asked him where he came from. When War
Sang said Canton, the man became reminis-
cent about a Chinese girl he met when he
was in a Yankee barque trading out of San
Francisco. Did War Sang know her? Fuey
Kee was her name. War Sang nodded. Her
father’s silk shop was near his father’s pork
shop. She was pretty old now, War Sang
said: there were nicer girls in Canton than
Fuey Kee. But War Sang’s dreams were of
San Francisco; the name of it was like a
song to him. There were many Chinese
there, and that w r as the city to which he
meant to make his way, where he would
settle and have a "wife and home.
They had been running slowly for about
an hour, when the fisherman stopped the
engine to listen. What he heard made him
get out a sack and tell War Sang to crawl
into it. In case the Customs men came out
he could impersonate a sack of fish. War
Sang obediently got into the sack and lay
huddled at the bottom of the boat. But the
man was becoming more uneasy. He tied
up the sack’s mouth with a piece of rope,
hauled it on to the half deck at the stern,
and told War Sang to lie still and, if an
alarm came, to say nothing. Should the
Customs launch stop them, he told War
Sang, he "would lower the sack over the
stern, but leave War Sang’s head out of
water, so that he could breathe. It would
be cold, but it would not be for long. Then
he restarted his engine and crept along in
tliG darkness.
Presently the sound of a fast launch came
clearly, and a bright light shone on the port
side. It was too late to make a dash for it.
“Keep still,” the fisherman said. He
lowered the sack over the stern and made
the line fast.
A big boat loomed up ahead, sweeping
round so as to head off the fisherman in case
he decided to trust to his speed. The Cus-
toms men steered to run alongside, and their
high-sided craft slid and bumped against the
fishing-boat’s gunwale.
“This is the United States you are in,”
a loud voice hailed. “What’s the big idea
to-night?”
“Just coming over for gasoline,” the fisher-
man told the officer. “They have raised the
price on us again in Canada. Were you
expecting someone else?”
“No, you are the man we’re after. We’ll
just look you over.”
A man in a mackinaw and seaboots clam-
bered on to the launch and began to turn
over everything in reach as though he was
looking for contraband liquor.
The fisherman’s hopes rose. Evidently
they were looking for bootleg, not for aliens,
such as Chinese. Somehow the thought of
Fuey Kee, the Chinese girl of Canton, kept
coming up, and it softened him strangely, so
that by association he felt sorry for War
Sang. Ilis fingers touched his sheath-knife
at his belt, and he moved casually nearer
the stern where the rope was made fast. But
he did not attempt to cut it. He would give
War Sang a chance. In the darkness the
searcher might not see it. But still he
might. So the fisherman was ready, for he
did not intend to be caught with a live
Chinese hanging over the counter.
With a quick movement the Customs man
was beside him, suspicion in every action.
He knew the game of smuggling-in Chinese.
“What’s that line got at the other end of
it?” he asked.
“Nothing. It’s only a slack line.” The
man-smuggler cursed inwardly that he had
not cut it.
The Customs officer took hold of the line
and tugged. It came away in his hands.
He fell over backwards, half-recovered and
clattered down into the cockpit, cursing.
The fisherman’s eyes stared in amazement.
The knot that held War Sang had slipped!
“God ! What a lucky thing !”

Sovereign Hill.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SOVEREIGN HILL forty years ago was
bald, scarred, pitted with shafts and
tunnels, and encrusted witli heaps and
ridges of the erupted mullock of the Golden
Point: of Ballarat. What fortunes were
scraped from the shallow leads of its flanking
gullies and gouged from the quartz-reefs of
its foundations! Deep under its eastern
slopes, from north to south, some. Midas-
finger of creation’s days had trailed the
pencil-mark of the famous Indicator, along
which the gold hung in the.stone like bunches
of grapes.
The glories of the alluvial days had long
departed, but quartz-mining was in its
prime; and the Speedwell on the north, Nor-
mandy on the summit, and Woah Hawp
group on the south of the hill enriched their
shareholders —and, alas! infected their toil-
ers with the slow poison of miners’ disease.
Stock Exchange directors, legal managers
and so on boomed, flourished and waxed fat.
The miners slaved and sweated in foul air,
imperilling life, limbs and lungs, and raised
big families on £2 ss. a week.
Still, they were halcyon days for us kids.
We took our bread and dripping, when Dad
was out of work, cheerfully enough, as long
as the quantity was right, played and fos-
sicked among the old workings on holidays
and whenever we could “wag it” from school,
and donned without fuss any garments de-
vised for our use, childishly ignorant of the
bitter struggle of the old people to rear
their sons and put them to some trade, some
calling, anything almost but mining. Grim
necessity generally drove the elder sons into
the foul depths, but their sacrifice often en-
abled the younger ones to escape.
We lived just behind the old Speedwell,
where Dad worked, so close that the roar
of her batteries used to keep visiting rela-
tives awake at night. To ws, of course, the
noise was like the ticking of a bedroom clock.
If a stoppage occurred through the night
the sudden calm would awaken every one of
us. Dad’s workmates lived near by, and in
time the old vampire sucked the youth and
life-blood of them all. They were old men
at fifty, and a few more? years saw them
totter home from the shaft-mouth for the
last time.
Pioneers of the ’fifties were plentiful in
those days. Dad was one of them, and so was
his brother Jim, who lived at Mount Plea-
sant. Uncle Jim was a kindly, white-bearded
old bachelor, a great yarn-spinner when,
after an occasional Sunday dinner with us,
he and Dad sent their memories back into
the roaring days. Fights and fortunes won
and lost, bushrangers and the gold escort,
the Melbourne coach flying along Main-road
to the tune of “Wait for the Waggon,” Lola
Montez and her horsewhip, Eureka —well,
Deadwood Dick and Buffalo Bill were floored
and forgotten when Uncle Jim got going.
But the tale that gripped us hardest gen-
erally came last, because the argument oYer

A Fair Warning

Frequently the first sign of kidney trouble is a slight

Tis well to pay attention to the first sign. Weak
kidneys generally grow weaker, and neglect is often
dangerous. People in Australia place reliance in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. This tested remedy
has been used in kidney trouble for years, and is recommended all over the civilised world.

Mr. Jas. C. Struck, Yugilbah, 4 Eurella Street, Burwood, Sydney, says:
“Seven years ago I was very ill with a bad attack of disordered kidneys. I
suffered excruciating agony from backache and was at times so bad that I
could hardly move. Everything I had to do was a trouble, and I was miser-
able and depressed. The kidney secretions were thick and cloudy and
contained a red sediment, and my ankles swelled to twice their usual size.
I went on suffering in this way for a long time, nothing I took doing me any
good, but at last I got the right remedy, and that was Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. After taking two bottles of these Pills I felt much relieved,
and by the time I had finished eight bottles I was completely cured and felt
a different man.”
Ten years later Mr. Struck says:—“Thanks to Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills I am still free from backache and kidney trouble.”

its ending led Mother, the peacemaker, to
change the subject to current affairs.
In the Spring of ’57 Dad, Uncle Jim and
a partner known as Sailor Tom discovered
a small tributary lead running off from a
worked-out open cutting on the north slope
of Sovereign Hill. The wash averaged only
a few inches in thickness, but was wonder-
fully rich. It ran straight back into the hill-
side; and, as the ground above was loose
and broken, the party drove a tunnel in the
hard sandstone underneath and took the
wash from above, thus saving the time and
trouble of heavy timbering. They named
their show the Centurion, after Tom’s old
ship. By the end of November they had
driven 70ft. or 80ft., and the weekly clean-
up had averaged sixty ounces from the start.
Then the wash suddenly thickened to about
?»ft. The gold was “like plums in a puddin’,”
as Uncle Jim used to say. It went in like
that for about 4ft., and then as suddenly
petered out in a solid wall of sandstone.
It was the finish. But that last pocket
yielded just over 1200 oz. of solid, water-
worn gold.
It was Saturday afternoon when they had
the big clean-up; so the partners had to
mount guard over their stuff till Monday
morning. The gold, in twelve canvas bags,
was stored in the far end of the tunnel;
the tent was pitched near its mouth, and
they divided the night into three four-hour
watches. They told no one of their “strike,”
although it was well known they were on
good gold.
Saturday night passed quietly. On Sun-
day, at midnight, Dad went off duty and
Sailor Tom went on. And that was the last
seen of Sailor Tom. Uncle Jim awoke at
daylight, realised in alarm that his call was
nearly an hour overdue, and roused Dad.
Tom had vanished; also seven of the gold
bags. And then and there Dad and Uncle
Jim started their twenty-five years’ argu-
ment. Dad had great faith in the missing
partner, but Uncle held (with good reason,
it seemed to us) that no outsider could have
passed the tent, carrying the gold and Sailor
Tom, without being heard or leaving some
trace. ' (
They went to the police, and the whole
camp was ransacked, but all they learned
was that another digger had vanished on
Sunday night—a West Indian known as
Black Sam, a sawn-off giant with a reputa-
tion as dark as his hide, and a steel hook
in place of a left hand.
Dad said the nigger had murdered Tom,
hidden the body and skipped with the gold.
Uncle Jim maintained that the missing ones
were partners in the robbery. The strangest
thing about the whole affair —and here the
disputants were in agreement—was that a
pne-armed bigger, as broad as he was high,
could disappear so suddenly and never be
heard of again.
• Dad never struck it rich after that,
although he tried dozens of other fields, and
ranged as far away as the Palmer and
Charters Towers. Now, within half a mile
.of the old Centurion, he was on wages, toil-
•ing to support a wife and eleven youngsters.
The tunnel was still there, the overhead
timbers rotted and falling, floor piled with
debris, but a favored haunt of ours on Satur-
days and holidays; in fact, it was only our
burrowing and scraping that kept the old
excavation from being blocked up altogether.
We were solemnly warned of the risk of these
operations, but even the buckle-end of Dad’s
belt failed to overcome the fascination of
our favorite game—“reconstructing the
crime,” as the evening papers say.
Also, when “saving up” for Christmas, we
used to plant our fossicking equipment
(cradle, dishes, pick and shovel) here. In
dry weather payable wash was obtained by
sweeping, with a yard broom, the roads
round the Golden Point School, and even
the school ground itself, mostly at early
hours before Authority was astir. Just up
the gully from the tunnel was the old post-
office dam, where we did our cradling and
panning-off—-dumping-place this for all the
unwanted dogs and cats of Golden Point. It
was full of “crayfish,” and in summer was
our handiest swimming-hole. They used to
sniff our hair when we got home, suspect, on
a hot day; and then it was the strap for
us, and a lump of brown soap and stern
orders to get in the tub under the tap and
scrub out some of the odor. How we escaped
typhoid is a mystery. We must have been
tough.
It was the last Saturday before the Christ-
mas holidays, and we were toiling like small
coolies to accumulate the few shillings needed
for the Christmas Eve orgy and the picnics
and fishing trips to the lake and gardens.
The day had been broiling hot, and occa-
sional dips in the murky waters of the dam
had delayed our clean-up till late in the after-
noon. Bulging black clouds rising from the
west and a rumble of thunder awakened us
to the need for hurry. Joe and I were in
the far end of the tunnel, stowing our things
away, and Jim was waiting at the mouth,
when a white blaze of lightning and crash-
bang of thunder shook the hillside. The
candle-end slipped from my fingers, and black
darkness swallowed us.
“Bill, Bill, I’m blinded!” screamed Joe,
and the same terrifying thought came to me.
I struck a match, and the brief gleam brought
mighty relief. We could see! We stared
each into the other’s frightened face, and
then around into the close darkness. There
we saw something that chilled our momen-
tary joy to a fresh terror. Between us and
the entrance a big fall of earth had blocked
the tunnel altogether. We were buried alive.
As the match flickered out we huddled to-
gether, sick with fear. I clearly recollect
that my first thoughts were not of this world
but of the next; and my expectations in
that direction were distinctly gloomy.
Stephen John Penhallurick, superintendent
of the Sunday-school we attended, when Dad
had time to convoy us to the door, wasted
no time in picturing for us the joys of
Heaven; but his verbal etchings of the place
prepared for young demons who threw stones
on the roof during ch|>ir 7 practice, chewed
“stink-nuts” (wattle-seed) in Sunday-
school, and didn’t know Jonah from Goliath
left little to the imagination. .
But fatalism was never a strong point
with the native-born. Thoughts of Old Nick
and his barbed hayfork drove us (I grieve
to confess) not to prayer, but to attempts
to dig our way out. The air was still fresh,
and our stock of candle-ends sufficient for
an hour or more; so we clambered to the top
of the mound and picked and shovelled as
we never had before. We both believed that
brother Jim was safe, and it comforted us
mightily to think that he was free to sum-
mon help. As we heard afterwards, this is
just what he did do. Thinking that the
whole tunnel had collapsed, ho tore off
through the rain and tliunder-claps, and,
finding Dad and big brother Charlie at home,
had them and a neighbor at the rescue work
within twenty minutes. But before any sign
or sound of this came to us, we stumbled
on that which, though it gave another jolt
to our sorely-shaken nerves, led to the solu-
tion of the old Centurion mystery; or, rather,
as much of it as will ever be divulged before
Judgment Day.
Our excavating was slow work at first,
as the loose stuff kept sliding down from
above; but suddenly we broke through, not,
however, into fresh air and blessed daylight,
but into an old drive running off at right
angles to the tunnel, and a foot or so above
it. Small as we were, we had to stoop to
enter it. It was as dark as the hole we had
loft, and the air, though good enough to
keep the candle alight, had a queer smell
that reminded me of toadstools. We groped
along for a yard or two without sighting
the end, and then Joe, who was in the lead
with the candle, gave a startled yell and
backed into me. You can guess I backed
too—backed so swiftly that I fell into the
tunnel. Next second Joe landed on top of
me.
“What was it, Joe?” I chattered, as we
lay shivering on the mullock.
“A skeleton !” said Joe. “A man’s skeleton !
I saw the skull.”
“Light the candle, Joe,” I quavered.
“Can’t,” said Joe. “I dropped it; and it’s
the last.”
After a while, as w T e cuddled together in
the pitch dark, a faint sound seemed to throb
through the ground beneath us. At first I
thought it w r as the beating of our hearts,
but it steadily grew louder —a regular thud,
thud, thud. Then a pause; then the thud,
thud, thud again.
“What’s that?” I whispered.
Joe did not answer for a second or two.
I knew he was listening, ear to the ground.
Then I felt him spring up. “Come on, Bill,”
he shouted. “They’re digging us out.” And
we fell to work like two fox-terriers at a
rabbit burrow.
It was not long before the glorious light
broke through, and we yelled to them that
we were all right. We heard one cry, and
scrambled out to find Dad lying in a heap,
with Charlie and big Bill Webb leaning over
him. They were all stripped to the waist,
and the sweat on them glistened in the candle
light.
“You young devils!” panted Charlie. “Get
home out of this. Dad’s fainted.”
Poor Dad! He didn’t get over it for days.
In fact, our guilty consciences know that
he never got over it. That shock aggra-
vated the deadly effects of the deep mining,
and it was not many months before he had
to give up work altogether. But next morn-
ing, when Joe told him about the old drive
and the skeleton, it was all mother could do
to keep him in bed. “Sailor Tom; it’s Sailor
Tom,” he repeated. So one of the young-
sters was sent flying for Uncle Jim, and
early on Monday morning he and Charlie
opened up the old workings.
But Dad was wrong. It was not Sailor
Tom. At least not that one. There was
no left hand among that little mound of
bones and cloth-shreds—only a rusted steel
hook where the hand should have been. The
body lay face downward, feet towards the
tunnel, as if he had tripped and fallen full-
length with the heavy load. And close along-
side, so close that the mouldering canvas
was mingled with the bones, was the load—
not an ounce missing!
Fifteen feet further on they came upon
another crumbling frame—Sailor Tom's,
without a doubt. There were liis big silver
ring and the rusted remains of his knife and
revolver, the latter loaded in every chamber.
Through the top of the skull, towards the
back, was a clean round hole.
“Bullet?” said Charlie, pointing; but
Uncle Jim shook his head. “No,” he said;
“no shot was fired in the tunnel that night.
It would have sounded like a cannon in that
space.”
Then, without another word, he went back
to the other skeleton and picked up the rusty
hook. Returning, he slipped the point of
the hook into the hole in Tom’s skull. It
ran in easily, right to the bend. You see,
something of Black Sam’s reputation had
flashed back to Uncle’s memory.
Charlie’s eyes and mouth open in horrified
comprehension. “Th’ black devil!” he
gasped.
Thus, once more, long-hidden murder
came out.
Somehow, Black Sam had become aware of
the old workings that, unknown to Dad’s
party, had pierced so close to their tunnel.
It was quite impossible now to locate the
outlet, as all the shafts in the vicinity had
fallen in years before; indeed, they were
worked out and abandoned before the Cen-
turion was opened up. But it was easy to
guess how the murderous nigger had wormed
his way to the roof of the tunnel, removed a
slab or two, and, waiting his chance, dropped
like a steel-clawed panther on poor Tom
below. That was plain enough; also the
removal of the plunder, the hiding of the
body and the replacing of the slabs.
There was only one point that puzzled
everyone—miners, coroner, police: one ques-
tion that is likely to remain unanswered T
the end of time. What killed Black Sam?
What stopped him, so suddenly and effec-
tively, in the hour of his success? There
was no sign, not the slightest clue, to found
a theory on; so you can theorise for your-
selves.
The recovered gold made things more com-
fortable for poor Dad’s last few months;
but what pleased him most of all was the
fact that the great argument was settled
entirely in his favor—his staunch faith m
their old partner, Sailor Tom, was vindi-
cated.
