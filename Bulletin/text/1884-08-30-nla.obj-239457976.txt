What is Socialism?
This is a question which has lain in our
mind for many years. We do not yet feel
ourselves competent to fully elucidate it.
Socialism has an extensive literature of its
own. Its principles, as we understand them,
are co-temporaner-us with organised and
recorded thought. They are discoverable in
the social laws of Moses as recorded in the
Hebrew Scriptures, recognisable in the
philosophy of Plato, prominent in the
moral code of Jesus of Nazareth, scattered
through the idealisings of More; and, later,
glimmer amidst the works of the French
Encyclopcedists; and, in modern times, find
strong and coherent expression in the works
of St. Simon in Prance, Las-
salle and CarlMarx in Ger-
many, and, still more recently,
in pamphlets and brochures
by Hyndman, Morris, Camp-
bell, and a rapidly increasing
host of other writers in Eng-
land. Our list is, doubtless, as
incomplete as our knowledge.
Henry George, however, is
not a Socialist, although the
designation has constantly been
flung at him as a term of
obloquy. In a recent English
publication, we observe a
Socialist writer remarks : “ I
object to Henry George, not
because he is a Socialist, but be-
cause he is not a Socialist.” The
objection to George seems to
be that he halts on the thresh-
old of necessary reform, and,
while offering a genuine remedy
for some of the evils of exist-
ing society in his plan for
national appropriation of all
land rentals, he errs in in-
sisting that his remedy is a
panacea—a cure for all social
evils. The thorough-going So-
cialist contends that, while
George’s remedy for the evils
of landlordism is effectual for
those evils, there remain un-
healthy relations between Capi-
tal and Labour which would
still disorder the entire body
politic, even were the cancer of
land-monopoly extirpated.
* * *
We heartily wish that more
competent and more fully in-
formed teachers than our-
selves would undertake the duty of inform-
ing the public what the true meaning and
significance of this growing system—Social-
ism—are. But during all the years that we
have ourselves awaited and expected in-
struction through the medium of the local
press, we have received worse than none.
We have read intermittent sneers scoffs,
which even our own imperfect acquaintance
with tne subject enabled us to perceive
were not justified. In short, all arts have
been employed to disgust readers with the
name and idea of Socialism, while sedulously
keeping them ignorant of what Socialists
have to say for themselves. A superficial
acquaintance With the ideas of St. Simon,
learned from sundry brief summaries in
English magazines; a frequent study of the
laws of Moses, embodied in the Old Testa-,
ment; and a constant and appreciative study
of the principles of Jesus of Nazareth,
as recorded in the New Testament, have
been, until very recently, apart from re-
flections original to ourselves, almost our
entire field of information. With the tone
of Continental Socialism we are, conse-
quently, but slightly acquainted, but we
have been at the pains to procure some of
the most recent publications * by the Eng-
lish Social Democracy, and it is from their
contents, combined with the Bible, that we
propose to draw our materials for this
article.
• • •
In the first place, then, we will explain
as well as we can what all the trouble
is about. People naturally want to
know how there came to be Socialism
and Socialists at all: what their complaint
is, and Avhat their objects. Briefly, the com-
plaint is that the existing organisation of
society is all wrong; that it is antagonistic
to natural laws; that it is an organised an-
archy, maintained by force and fraud; that
it combines the maximum of human suffer-
ing with the minimum of true personal ad-
vantage. In more exact terms, the Socialists’
contention is that the inequalities of con-
dition—of wealth and poverty—created and
maintained by existing legalised systems,
are contrary to natural justice. Wealth, as
the exceptional advantage of individuals,
they sharply affirm is maintained solely by
The Robbery of the Poor.
• • •
This is the subject of Mr. Campbell’s
essay. He finds his text among the Proverbs
of Solomon, “Rob not the poor because he
is poor.” This, Mr. Campbell remarks,
seems, on the surface, a very extraordinary
exhortation. Men are told not to rob those
who have nothing to be robbed of, and they
are apparently tempted to do so by this very
fact that there is nothing to rob. Mr. Camp-
bell proceeds methodically. First, he de-
monstrates that there are poor in England
whose penury seems irreconcilable with the
idea that they have not suffered foul play.
He reviews the conventional explanations
of the existence 6f the desperately poor.
“The poor are drinkers,” say the Temper-
ance people, “and so from temperance plat-
forms the people are told by the rich and
well-to-do . . • that they must really re-
form their habits, and not leave their feui
and desolate abodes for the gin-shop with its
glittering attractions.” Again, they are
thriftless. The grim satire of the Bari of
Derby, who enjoys an income exceeding
£170,000 a year, telling the poor of England, in
a speech at the Mansion-house, that it is their
duty, everyone of them, to live within their
means and lay by something every year, “as
he, by much restraint and self-denial, we are
to suppose, contrives to do,” is pointed
out. Next, the country is over-populated !
So cry the Malthusiaus and the advocates
for emigration,
“Perhaps,” writes Mr. Campbell, “no one sur-
passes in insolence these two kinds of reformers.
Neither have the faintest idea, or apparent desire
to obtain the faintest idea, of what number of
people the land of England can maintain, under the
conditions laid down by the Almighty Maker of
them and it. Get rid," he cries, “of every super-
fluous person in the land, by all means; but, per-
haps. before you talk any more about that, you
win the goodness to find out and settle who
the superfluous person is.’’
And he indicates pretty clearly that the
superfluous person is more likely the idle
non-producer than the producer and
worker. Again : “The poor must be better
housed,” cry another class. “The State
must take the matter in hand, and provide
them w‘ith fit accommodation at the lowest
possible rent.” Of course, if land and
wealth escape their due proportion of taxa-
tion, this remedy would simply burden the
rather poor with the cost of accommodation
for the very poor. But Mr. Campbell
simply remarks —
“Very well. But will any one kindly inform me
what he thinks should be ‘the lowest possible
rent ’ a woman earning sixpence a day, or a man
one shilling and flvepence, pap he to
pay ? ”
Brushing aside these futilities, the writer
cries, “ What is the root of the matter
then ? ” and answers—
" What but this: As a people we have forgotten
God. We have forgotten what Justice means.*
w e have made and passed laws, not as to us seemed
just, but as seemed expedient. We have sought,
dealing man with man, not the just thing, but
simpiy the gainful. And as a net result and out-
come of it all, our laws and the accepted constitu-
tion of society are such that there is going on
throughout the length and breath of the land, in
thousands of tho subtlest and cunningest of ways,
unchecked, unheeded—nay, applauded and ap-
proved of—that which the Hebrew sage of old
warned his fellow-man against—the robbery of
the Poor by the Rich, simply because they are
Poor!”
Next comes the demonstration. What
have the poor to be robbed of ? is an obvious
inquiry at this stage. The reply is, in effect,
they have their property. The property of
the poor ? Nonsense! A definition is re-
quired. What, then, is property, if the poor
are among the propertied classes ? Mr.
Campbell professes to discover that econo-
mists have not yet provided a definition,
and proposes one of his own. Property, he
holds, is that which is proper
to a thing, part and parcel of
that thing, and which cannot
be dissociated from it without
it being destroyed in its dis-
tinctive nature. This seems
exact. We talk thus of the
properties of a magnet, of oxy-
gen, of steel, and so forth. With
respect to a man, the term is
evidently inapplicable to any-
thing external to his own
being.
“ A man’s property, in its simplest
meaning:, is all that rests within bis
own frame, all the powers of body
and mind which by nature are his.
These are all that a man can call
‘ his own,’ to which no one but the
Almighty Giver can have a prior
claim.”
This being “private property,”
what are its rights and what is
“common property?” Access
to such things and opportuni-
ties as are necessary for the
sustaining and renewing of soul
and body. That is the definition
of natural rights, and of com-
mon property. Nothing very
monstrous, so far.
»i • *
Here, then, we have ex:act
propositions. Personal pro-
perty is what, belongs to each
man s body and mind. Com-
mon property is what Nature
has provided of material things
which are necessary for the
sustaining of life. The natural
rights of man are simply the
rights of access to these
material things—in other words,
the right of living. Hence,
the right of living being equal in
all men, the right of access to the material
things which are necessary for the mainten-
ance of life is equal to all. If this be ad-
mitted, then is private property in land
condemned, since land is one of the material
things which have in them the life-maintain-
ing faculty, just as air and water have. This
is, in fact, Henry George’s main conclusion,
arrived at by a distinct line of argument.
i*i
But now comes a fresh departure. Sup-
posing the right of man to have access to
material things and to produce from them
by his labour, articles of use, were not
denied him, George holds that all would be
well. The Socialists dispute this. They say
men might still be robbed of their labour.
They declare that men arc so robbed. And

they assert that it is to denial of their com-
mon rights and to robbery of their labour
that the hopeless poverty of the many is
jointly attributable. Here, therefore, we
arrive at the conflict between Labour and
Capital which Hbnjiv George regards as in-
essential, the political economists of the old
school as unavoidable, and the Socialists as
criminal. At this point we resume our
quotations from Mr. Campbell; —
“ These conditions being thus recognised, a man
is entitled, by duly exercising his powers upon any
portion ot this common property, to produce any
commodity or natural wealth in a form ready tor
us . . . . If another man desires a similar com-
modity, l*t him go to the common-wealth and pro-
duce It for himself; or, what is the same thing,
let him ask tho other to exchange it for its due
equivalent.”
That due equivalent will be some other
article upon which an equal amount of
labour has been expended—the “natural”
value being common to both. This is honest
exchange. No one is the gainer over the
other. One man can become richer than
another only to the extent that he is more
laborious, more apt, or more thrifty. Such
persons will have, rightly, more claims than
others upon the general wealth, because
embodied in tnat wealth is more of their
labour, or more of the fruits of their personal
property, their abilities.
+ * ♦
Now, as Capital is simply stored-up Labour,
under these conditions the industrious, thrif-
ty, and able would be the capitalists of
society. But no one would be much richer
than another. That is, considering a simple
state of society. But invention steps in. A
machine is conceived and constructed which
can, with one man’s guidance, produce what
ten men’s labour was previously required to
produce. This machine is (say) an improved
kind of loom for the spinning of cotton shirt-
ing. The community has hitherto had all its
wants supplied by ten men who have been
paid in proportion to their labour. The
machine in the hands of one man produces
all that is required; and, as only one man is
to be maintained, the product can be ex-
changed at a oneaper Tho other nine
spinners are starved out. The one man
receives nearly as much as heretofore had
been paid to ten. Cheapness creating de-
mand, he erects a second machine, and
offers wages to one of the nine to work it.
As there are nine iqcn anxious to get the
occupation, they bid against one another,
and he who offers to take the smallest pro-
portion of his true labour value gets the
post. The machine owner now has two
looms at work, equal to twenty men’s labour,
and expends only his own labour and half the
value of his hired assistant’s He pockets the
other half as part of his gain. He has thus
“robbed the poor because he is poor.” But
■his success excites rivalry. Other machines
are made, and competition bi-tween capital-
ists sets in. Society, then, is for the first
time distinctly benefited by some saving
effected of the cheapness of production be-
ing allowed to purchasers. Meanwhile, a
starvation class is beiog created among the
displaced weavers. Want and hunger have
begun their ravages. They are followed by
envy, recklessness, negligence at work,
thieving, despair. Society begins to require
gaols, police, and slave-drivers styled over-
seers. And all this they have to pay for.
Against their gain by cheapness of produc-
tion has to be set-off their lossby demoraliza-
tion and misery'in their midst.

Despite our moat strenuous efforts to con-

through our.subject. We have not yet an-
swered the which appears at the
head of this article. 3kor can we hope to
even approximately do justice to the expo-
sition with the sp&oe just now at our dis-
posal. At this stage, therefore, we will
break off, deferring until our next issue the
further elucidation of tho extremely inter-
esting problems under consideration.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Splendid Reception.
The return of Sir Parkes is, to some
creatures, like the return of Summer. He is the
luminary of thsir existence. Deprived of his light,
they languish in torpidity and obscurity. At the
touch of his rays, they are warmed and quickened
into life and motion, and begin to squirm and
•wriggle from their holes and and to
creep again uncannily before the eyes of a shud-
dering public. On this Saturday, a public banquet
is to be given to the patron .saint of creatures of
the kind. Names which have been almost for-
gotten, and which the people of New South Wales
would fain forget altogether, except it were to
point a moral and adorn a tale, come Into print
again; published with the pretecs on t at the
grovelllngs and homage of their d sgraced and
contemned owners can confer something other
than indignity upon any man whom they brand
with the blister of their approval. Sir Henry
Parkes is a man of talent. Granted. His talents
are of the order which deserve admiration and
esteem. Not granted. Has he so ordered his life,
has he so employed the gifts of Providence, as to
be a type for fathers to indicate to their sons-a
model for imitation, an example to be heaved
aloft and held up for the edification of the youth
of Australia? Only Providence can endow a man
with talent; so that the fact that Sir Henry
Parkes is clever'suppliesno reason why he should
be loaded with distinction. Our young men
cannot become gifted by emulating. But Provi-
dence leaves to man the employment of its en-
dowments. Is it, then, the use that Sir Henry
has turned his gifts to, that the ban lusters would
fain have our young men emulate ? Are they, as
fathers, or as elders of the people, desirous of say-
ing, let your life be as his; deserve by similar con-
duct a like reputation as to your dealings with
your neighbour; be such a man in regard for your
word, be such a man in regard for your obliga-
tion; earn such a reputation lor integrity in pri-
vate life, and disinterestedness in public affairs;
study to leave, like him, your mark in the public
records of your country; be known, like him, for
the self-sacrificing devotion of your career: como
to be favoured, like him, by the attachment of all
that are despicable among public men—do these
things and you will do well ? We shall observe
with interest the tendency o: the speakers, and
how they will reconcile with their dedre to hold
up their idol as an example for the present and
rising generation, the circumstance that ho re-
turns, after having sacrificed to bis personal ag-
grandisement his duty as a public man, during
one of the most momentous crises in the affairs of
this colony which has occurred during the past
score of years.
A Noble Cause.
We observe with admiration that an effort is being
made to work up another meeting on the case of
—Andersen, Esq.— a gentleman who has been a
good deal before the public of late. The free and
enlightened persons who howled at the last meet-
ing, are much aggrieved that the Government has
not adopted their suggestions, and the fact that
the magistrates who dated to sentence the saintly
Andersen to the penalty of the law have not been
dismissed, and that the “ pusillanimous ” constable
who in the most cowardly way interfered with the
enjoyments of Mr. Andersen and his ladyfiiend
has not been flogged, as suggested at the meeting,
has aggravated these persons beyond endur mce.
We fully sympathise with them. The only point
they have gained sj far i* that the Governraenl
intend, when printing the papers connected with
the case Of their interesting protegfS, to omit all the
gross indecencies In 1 he evidence. To include these
in the printed papers might outrage the delicate
susceptibilities of Mr. Andersen, and the reflntd
feelings of his lady associate. The inclusion of these
details might, on 1 he other hand, have the outrage-
ous effect of inducing people to believe that the
magistrates were fully justified. And what a
scandalous injury to Mr. Andersen that would
be! The suppression of th se parts of the evi-
dence will necessarily have the effect of convinc-
ing everyone who reads the half of the evidence
which Is printed that Mr. Andehshsn never did
anything disgusting, since nothing of a disgusting
nature is to be published. We would recommend
that if these carefully expurgated papers be pub-
lished In time, they be read at the proposed meet-
ing, and the absence of ady testimony of filthy
conduct will then serve to justify a resolution that
the magistrates be Hogged and dismissed, and that
Mr. Andersen be appointed to fill one of the
vacancies as some compensation for the outrage
he has suffered, and as a slight testimony of the
appreciation felt for his pure and lofty character.
The other position might be ottered to his lady
friend, who has, we believe, been flung into a
loathsome dungeon for her share in the adventure
which has conferred fame, and, we trust, will give
fortune by compensation, to her fond lover. W*
think It hardly fair that so much should have been
said of Mr, Andersen, and so little of the lady
It is true she has not, like him, been flogged: bui
—this should weigh with the meeting—she de-
served to be quite as much as he did. Why should
so Interesting a character be neglected ? Interest-
ing ? Certainly. The woman w ho has been loved
by the high-souled Andersen cannot but be inter-
esting; also, noble.
The "Times’” Morality.
The French have apparently emulated at Foochow
theexploitsof ourownNavy at Alexandria. With-
out any formal declaration of war, but simply after
notice given by the Admiral in command of the
fleet, they have bombarded the forts and the city.
The London Times, with extraordinary Pharisee-
ism, has charged the French Admiral with violat-
ing the rules of civilised warfare. The charge
seems accurate enough; but there is something
revoltingly hypocritical in the assumption of the
Times that we are in a position to pose as moral-
ists. If the bombardment of Foochow was just a
sickening massacre of Chinese, the description
equally fitted the bombardment of 'Alexandria
and the rout of Tel-el-Kebir by British forces.
The resistance at Foochow seems at least to have
been more effective than the resistance at Alex-
andria. The loss on board the French fleet is
given at six men killed, which is a ‘‘sickening
slaughter” as compared with the casualties on
board our own fleet at Alexandria. We had only
one man killed. The French had als > a gun-boat
injured, and a torpedo-boat sunk. We had no
vessel injured and no boat sunk. Much of the
Podsnappeuy of the Times and similar papers is
due to the fact that it has been fashionable to
represent war as a noble and inspiring business,
whereas, it is, in its essence, simply the black-
guard violence of nations-ruffianism on a large
scale. In its essence, it is brutal, foul, and treach
erous. To deceive an enemy is one of the highest
talents of a great Commander, and the secret ot
victors has generally been the art of making every
one of their battles an unequal one. Students of
history are aware that the successes of Frederic
the Great and Napoleon—taking two modern
examples—were almost invariably gained by de-
ceits. That is to siy, by amusing their adversaries
with expectation ot attack in one direction, and
then overwhelming them with superior numbers
at a point left weak. There is no chivalry in war.
There is cheating, and brutality, and ruffianism.
And it is true that the French have conducted
themselves with brutal violence towards Foochow.
They have gone to the length of killing Chinese,
and have committed arson, and assault and bat-
tery. They weren’t particular about giving notice
when they would begin, nor were they nicely deli-
cate about the moment of leaving off. This is
horrible and revolting. But at least there was no
incident so shameful as the offer of a reward for
the head of Osman Uigna by our Admiral
Hewett at Souakim, aud, above all, it is not so
horrible and revolting as the shameless and un-
blushing hypocrisy of the Times’ moral indig-
nation 4
Several Berlin journals are inclined to
look on the proposed approprlasion on the east
coast of New Guinea by the Australian Govern-
ments on behalf of England, as a measure specially
devised to forestall Germany.
Queensland’s proposal to adopt the Cana-
dian military system is a wise one, the Dominion
defence force being by far the most economical,
as well as the most efficient, of British colonial
armies. The sooner New South Wales follows
suit, the better
A Spanish Socialist journal denounces the
defection of one of its contributors by the follow-
ing paragraph, which has at least the merit of
candour:—“ We beg to inform our readers, with a
feeling of indignation, that M. Arostigild bus
ceased to belong to our staff. He has written to
our editor to say that, having inherited a sum of
6000 piastres from a relative, be considers his new
position as incompatible with our doctrines.” We
suppose he meant that their doctrines were incom-
patible with his new position.
The French Chambers, sitting in joint
congress, have decreed the Republic inviolable,
and declared members of ex-ruling families in-
capable of holding the Presidentship. This throws
the burden of illegality upon any attempt of the
Comte de Paris, or Pion-Plon, or Victor to come
forward as a candidate. ’Tis, perhaps, a pity that
this course should have had to be adopted, Aet it
may have been done to avoid needless bloodshed.
As to the chances of success of either a Royalist
or an Imperialist pronunciamento, they are inllni-
tesimal, seeing that tha ‘‘new model” French
army is Republican almost to a man.
Country Money for City Lands.
(From the “ Illawarra Argus.”)
lu the course of a few weeks the railway line,
which connects Sydney with the wealthiest agri-
cultural and mineral district in Australia, will b«
opened. That line is the one known far and wide
as the Illawarra Railway. It is a fact within the
general knowledge that during the past ten years
nearly £6,000,000 of good, solid money has been in-
vested in land and buildings On the old railway
suburbs of Sydney. Huge areas of splendid land,
which for years had lain Idle, have been divided
and and built upon, till now the me-
tiopolis of Sydney may be said to te joined right
Through her populous suburbs to Parramatta.
Along the line there is a continuous growth of at
least ten miles, and there is Scarcely afoot between
Homebush and Parramatta that has not been sold
for building purposes, and which, in ten years
more, will be a succession of thriving townships.
And it can safely be said with regard to these
huge investments that there is hardly one in
a thousand that hasn’t exhibited a solid In-
crease in value. Nearer the city, the major-
ity of investments have Increased 1000 per
cent. The opening of the Illawarra railway line
offers just the same. If not improved, advantages
to people who were not fortunate enough to se-
cures sites on the old railway lines. The Angio-
Australian Investment, Finance and Land Com-
oany, one of the w- aithi< St In Sydney, has secured
on tlie Itlawarralire, the largest estate yet offered
to the Australian public oa subdlvmon. This
splendid estate is only twelve miles from Sydney.
L'his is a few minutf s’ run in the train to and Irom
business in the city, and the Company have re-
solved on a far more liberal plan of subdivision
than yet attempted. A great deal of mischief, it
is now seen and admitted, has been done in the old
railway suburbs by reason of the small building
site?, which tend to dwarf the general character
of he suburban residence; but the Anglo-Aus-
tralian Company have decided not to have less
than two-acro blocks, and there will be also three-
acre and five-acre blocks, on this great subdivision
now announced. This will be a guarantee to any
man investing that there will be an improved style
of building in the vicinity of this investxent, and
it will be very surprising if, in the course or a
couple of years, this subdivision is not found to
be the basis of the best-planned and wealthiest pt
all the suburbs of Sydney. And the Company, m
making these subdivisions, have resolved on a plan
>f na* me f s which is certain to meet with uni-
versal adop ion. The Company wi 1 not require
aeposits, uor will interest be charged. A fair
profit only will be charged on the whole subdi-
vision, and this has been found to work out so that
ou the two-acre blocks only Us. 6d. per month will
be required; 21s 9d. on the three-acre blocks, and
;«s. 3d. on the five-acre blocks. This is by far
the most liberal plan yet devised, and it is
not surprising to bear that hundreds of ap-
plications are already in. The announcement
of the subdivision has particular interest for resi-
dents all over the interior of the country. Duricg
the past tbr e years a great deal of surplus ooun-
ry money has been gradually finding its way into
the Sydney land market, and the most substantial
results have been noted. City property always
idvances in value teu times faster than those of
the inland centres—a natural result of the greater
growth of the metropolis in population. Hence, a
lotel-keeper, store-keeper, farmer, grazier, or
other business man puts a portion of nis savings
in city and suburban blocks, and the interests on
his money have been ten, twenty, and even fifty
times the profit greater than if allowed to remain
in a bank. Some thousands of blocks on the Par-
ramatta River, overlooking the chaini i m aquatic
course, are held by country residents in both N.
S. Wales and Queensland: and the same fact is
noticeable with regard to the subdivisions on the
>ld line of railway. The subdivision now an-
nounced by the Anglo-Australian Company,
besides being the largest and the most liberal
Is also the best that can be offered the pub
do of these colonies. The land to be sold
will form beautiful river side residences, and
the existence of droughts is unknown, so that all
kinds of agriculture may be adopted throughout
the subdivision. The Illawarra line opens up the
vast coal districts of the South Coast, and brings
the metropolis within a short run of the matchless
grazing, farming, and butter-producing ar ; as of
Wollongong, Kiama, &c. Hence the certainty of
a great traffic on the new lines, and the certainty
likewise of extensive building operations and
increased values for land. Country readers of
this article are invited at once to make the fullest
inquiries as to this great subdivision: and plans.

Fred. Pollock has opened the newly-
built Academy of Music, Adelaide, with tne
Pollard kids. Miss Flode Lome is the star:
she is chaperoned by her Mamma. A corres-
pondent considers “the Academy may or may
not prove a fortune for the enterprising Pol-
lard.” This is a very sate conclusion to come to!
The Academy, by the way, belongs to a slop mer-
chant and a photographer. The old hall, it will be
remembered, was the scene of a certain comme-
dian’s triumphs—only cut short by the vanman who
won the “magnificent suite of furniture,” nightly,

Minstrels have been having a great time, giving
entertainments for what they call, with some
vagueness, “ Local Charities.” We once knew an
amateur Minstrel troupe that always played for
charity. Only the charity began at home—and
stopped therp. Mr. A. Von Davans is the business
manager. Von Davans is probably Schleswig-
Holstein for John Evans. Zulu Thompson is do-
ing the usual stroke at Port Elizabeth (S.A.), and
forwards us some papers. It is funny exhi-
biting a Diorama of the Zulu War to the
Zulus; but it will be funnier still if some of
them call out in the middie of the entertainment,
“Not a bit like it.” It ap ears, loo, that Vernon
Reid has climbed up as far as Inverell, with C. J.
Tyrrel, Miss Tessie Horan, and other tremendous
performers, and it is set forth that Mr. R. Crabb,
G.S.V.t). (another crusher!), has been lecturing
on " Happy Homes ” at Morpeth, &c. Mr. C. does
not charge at the doors, but makes a collection
“to defray expenses.” Unselfish creature!
Cobar has lately been enlivened by a sword-swal-
lower and a snake-charmer. The swallower is said
to be a Hindoo. This reminds us of the “ African
Sword-swallower,” at Mr. Crummies’s farewell
supper, “who looked and spoke remarkably like
an Irishman.” — “Professor Heller” (of Ballarat)

He advertised the usual thing—presdigitation and
a present for everybody. It turned out that he
couldn’t do any tricks, and the gifts “ hadn’t ar-
rived”; so, to quote Alf.’s telegram, the people
rushed at him for their money, only “to find tne
police escorting him to the Globe Hotel, under a
running fire of such words as ‘swindler,’ ‘fraud,’
‘ Ballarat impostor,’ ‘ Drag him through the mud,’
&c,” This gift business has been rather overdone
lately. Ben Allah spoiled the market. But he was
a genius at it, and he could conjure. He’d adver-
tise to give away a kind of Tower of London re-
galia, showing the fleshing diamonds and gloam-
ing coffee sets in the window of a popular
tradesman. Then he would show, distri-
bute the tin - brooches, pin - cushions, and
penny - whistles, and before the audience
had sufficiently recovered from surprise to
give vent to indignation, Ben was ensconced
in his buggy, scampering away in the moonlight.

The Granville people have been giving a con-
cert in aid of St. Marks, in the School of Arts

and is historic chiefly on account of its possessing
four porters who won Jones’ sweep a year or so
ago. The star of the concert was a Mr. Marvin,
who, the Cumberland Independent says “ has a
voice” (it can’t, then, be Mervin,) “and knows
how to use it,” Mr. M'Manis, we believe, sang
with much applause, “ Sweet olden days,” and the
“Brave hold hoak,” while Mrs. Gowanlock elec-
trified the “push” with “My Je-ane,” and “The
Smugu-ugular.” The performers consider the
concert to be a complete artistic success... The
Baldwins, this reminds us, did Parramatta to indif-
ferent biz., lately. A local “cricket” says: “The
Professor, during the evening kept the audi-
ence alive with his witticiss (sfc), which were
of the most amusing character.” . Oh, and the

of singing “The Midshipmite,” “with a bad cold,”

“ to say the least is Hickstroardinary.” And you’ll
about die with disappointment when you read
that Dr. Clune has been lecturing in the City of
Oranges on his travels in England, Ireland, Scot-
land, and Wapping. The Government supplied
Dr. Clune with his travelling expenses, it will be
remembered, last small-pox time; but they had to
get a writ in order to persuade them. The doctor
lectured for the Sisters’ Parramatta Infants’
School. Dr. Clune chose the Tonarle (as Caron
used to call it) for the scene of bis triumphs; and
the next attraction there will be Madame Marius
and Miss Eva Thompson, who give a “mat.” on
the 2nd prox —Miss Marie Lanyon has been doing
big things with J. L. Hall, in “ She Stoops to Con-
quer,” at Hobart. Miss Jessie Grey used to be Mr.
Hall’s leading lady, but she is now adorning an-
other sphere. “’Twas ever thus.” Duncan
Macallum writes us a scintillating letter about the
Royal Comic Opera Company, which seems to be
composed of “Miss B. A. Lambert, Miss Bessie
Royal, Miss Lily Boleyn [111], Miss Carrie Sulman,
Mr. Vernon Reid, Mr. C. H. Templeton, Mr. Chas.
A. Tyrrell, Mr. A. Magney, Mr. P. Stuart, Mr. G.
Rocks:” and the “musical conductor is Mr. George
Tallis Trimnell.” [!! I] Duncan says that they have
made lots of money, and gives it us straight that
Vernon Reid has “a banking account.” It seems
that Vernon Reid had an offer to sing the tenor
part in “ The Merry Duchess,” but declined on
account of the overflow of bullion at GJen Tnnes.
. . Blood will flow soon. The Yass Courier noti-
fled that the Lawton Minstrels gave a “ pleasing
entertainment.” The same paper also states that
Miss Amy Rowe gave “ The White Squall." We’d
like to see Lawton again—even if he sang “For I
had but eighteenpenoe.” — An American musical
criticism:—“ As a singer she can just wallop the
hose off any that ever wagged a jaw on the boards.
From her clear, bird-llke upper notes, she would
canter away down to the base racket, and then
cushion back to a sort of spiritual treble that
made every man in the audience imagine that
every hair on his head was the golden string of a
celestial harp, over which angelic fingers were
sweeping,”
The Vogrichs.
On our front page will be found the portraits of
Herr Max Vogrich and his wife, whose musical
talents are now as familiarly known as household
words throughout Australia. They are young,
too—this gifted couple—Herr Vogrich having just
succeeded in leaving the leg of a table and walking
to his mother the year that Nicholas started on his
tour to Constantinople; while his wife didn’t see
the light for a good ten years afterwards. The
Herr comes of musical people, his father having
been conductor of an orchestra. We shall not
dwell on young Max's precociousness—how he
played the big drum at three, the trombone at
five, and the moutn-harmonioon at seven. It is
enough for us that these accomplishments—harm-
Uss enough in themselves, though fiercely pro-
vocative of murder in crowded neighbourhoods—
were given over for ever when young Vogrich
settled down to the study of composition, har-
mony, and the piano. He appears to have studied,
played, and composed everywhere, from Lapland
to the Alhambra, winning praise wherever he
went; but even now, in his calmer moments, he
thinks the happiest days of his life (we’ve not
spoken to him since his marriage) were when he was
blowing in vain down his trombone at Leipsic—the
stolid-looking little German-sausage concealer be-
side him having stuffed a cork down the instru-
ment. In 1881, he came to Australia with Wllhelmj,
and has been here ever since, playing, composing,
teaching, directing, and making himself agreeable
all round. Here he met his wife, who had just
discarded skipping-ropes and taffy, and possessed
—there’s no mistake about this, at all events —the
sweetest voice ever heard in Australia. Alice
Rees was her name, and Stawell, in Victoria, her
birth-place. How the noise of the crushing-
machines in that quartz town didn’t crack
her voice before she got through her first
reading lesson—“The cat has a rat,” or “The
rat has a cat is to us a mystery. How-
ever, she pulled through, and became, while in
her teens, the acknowledged songstress of Aus-
tralia. Her voice is as clear as a silver flute.
When she lays herself out to fetch a note, that
note might just as Wellcome down off its perch
and give in. The Vogrichs are settled in Sydney,
where they teach and intend giving occasional
concerts: and if the Sydney public really relish
music of the best sort, those concerts will be
packed.

is the first of the Spring crop. Unfortunately, it
got lost before we could work it off. Think the

this morning. The opening lines—the only ones
we remember—were delicate and suggestive:—
“ Along the groves,
With St. Mary’s coves,
I used to amuse myself.”
Yes, Carl; poetry is your line. You supply it, and
we’ll supply the dogs “J.L.T.”: Your leasing
proposals appear sound,but the teachings of Henry
George have not yet made sufficient progress in
Australia to justify us hoping for the introduction
of measures based on a denial of the right to pri-

it’s absurd to see silly girls neglect plain duties in
order to acquire a smattering of music or French,
particularly when this smattering is only intended
for vulgar show. But if you limit woman’s sphere

the De Staels and Goddards you are condemning
to commonplace, if useful, lives, when they might
be delighting mankind ? . ..“R.X.”: The lines are
commonplace. There’s not a touch of real poetry
about them. . “Threno-psycho”: We do not give
your verses, but we entirely agree with your sen-
timents regarding the “lash.” Its introduction
during the last quarter of the nineteenth century
was a huge blunder, and we consider deprives us
of all right to becomingly criticise the atrocities of

“ A.B.": Yes, always write on both sides of the

they will say they don’t, but they do. We've
actually seen a ‘ compo ” fall over his case, and
knock a leader into “pie” with gratitude on

training school. Of course, the chances are he’ll
fire you over the verandah, but he might happen to
be in good humour through seeing the candidates
lying beads and tails over the desks, hunting for
the vanishing point dropped from a string of
decimals on the black-board. If you catch him in
such a joyful moment, he might tell you what
“ Wilkinsism ” was. He knows. N.B.—Don’t for-
get to bring a blood-hound and the shaft of a

Mdme. Rita and Mr. J ohn Radcliff give a
lecture-concert on Thursday evening September!.
Mdme. Rita is a soprano of high culture, and Mr.
Radcliff is simply the greatest living flautist. He
lectures, and illustrates by playing every instru-
ment in the flute line, from the Pandean pipes up
to the perforated shin-bone of the last organ-
grinder he has killed. And Rita sings. There's no
shin-bone about her singing either. Their’s is
going to be an exceptional concert, and may not
be repeated. Radcliff; and Mrs. Radcliff didn’t
come here because Sydney concert platforms are
preferable to the boards or the orchestra of the
Royal Italian Ogera, and they are not going to
stop for ever.

And, lying on the table before us, is a let-
ter from Mi. James M. Costello, of Miller's Point,
stating that a concert is to be given on the 10th
prox., to aid in raising a fund to build an addition
to the Ophthalmic Hospital at Moore Cliff, Miller's
Point. Mr. Costello gives us the date all right,
and tells us that Annis Montague and Charles
Turner are to assbt, but he forgot to state where
the concert is to be held, hence we can t tell you.
THIS IS THE SORT OF THING TO TAKE

The late Charles Reade’s “ copy ” once

she never was more amiable or more elegantly

made in the islands of tho Pacific. It will then, in
all probability, bo published simultaneously in
Russian and English. This important work may
Oe preceded by a biography of M. Miklouho-Mac-
lay.” Apropos, the prettiest specimen of natural
history yet collected by the Baron comes from
Watson's Bay.
It is probable we are on the eve of one of
the greatest revolutions in tho world of thought
that has occurred since the age of Aristotle. Mr.
Ploton has been keeping quiet some time, and, it
1 1 rumoured has written a letter home direct to Mr.
.Spencer with a view to taking him out of winding.
His reply will be eagerly looked tor, but will take
some time to reach here—some time. Mr. Spencer
does not grapple with such opponents in a hurry—
not in a hurry.
In Cobnhill for July, there is a story
about Taglioni. The great dancer had a horror of
short skirts; and it appears that on one occasion
the Emperor of Russia went into the stalls to
satisfy himself of ihe fact that It was Impossible
to see her knee On one occasion one of her ad-
mirers suggested that she should shorten her dress
“just a very little. ’ "Signor,” replied the dan-
.sense. “I do not dance for men, 1 dance for wives
and daughters.”
The Rev. Mr. Munro, of the Scottish Free
Church, has i’eaigned because permit sion has been
given to ooiigi’egaUqna by the Ase ombly to use
instrumental music, which Mr. Reay holds to he
“ detrimental to the best interests of true religion.’’
We have heard of much damage being done by a
“kisto’ whustles.” Hadn’t thit Victorian station
master, who let the two trains collide and kill
people, the other day, neglected his duty to attend
“choir-practice ? ”
For all-round servility, London Figaro
takes the largest bun. Listen to this:— *'Prince
Albert Victor, the eldest son of the Prince of
Wales, is expected at Heidelberg. He will live
with the well-known historian. Professor Ihne, who
has been ordered to engage him a German valet.”
Ordered! If this be true—possibly ’tis only
Figaronian-and Ihne complied, German profes-
sors must bo nearly as toadylsh as aro nine-tenths
of their Oxford and Cambridge brethren.
The only public act the late Duke of Wel-
lington was reallv known for, was for presenting
a return-d transport at Court. The Judge who
had tried the man recognised him in the Crush
Room, and the gentleman who so ardently wished
to cultivate the society of Royalty was igno-
miniously turned out. Like Pip’s patron, Mag-
wich, the returned gentleman, had made “ a
powerful sight of money;” but then, you see,
Australian squatters were not so much in request
with crowned heads then as now. Otherwise
There it is again. Worse than doctors! A
Madame Pascalet attended the singing classes of
Ismael, the retired tenor, at Marseilles. Well,
Mons. P. found out that the Professor used to kiss
Madame Pascalet every time she went there, and
this news caused him considerable reflection. He
made enquiries, and found that Ismael was wont
to take his wife to the local Coogees and Bondis,
and has demanded a separation. We have resolved,
since wo learned this intelligence, to keep our eye
on the man who comes to teaoa our family the
key-bugle.
Tawhiao is “ doing it brown ” in London,
where, not knowing how to pronounce his name,
tney have christened him “ Taffy ” tor short. He
has been taking turns round Hyde Park in the
Life-Guards’ drag. At a reception, the King said
to those present that, “although his face was
black, he hoped he had a good heart.” We're
ready to swear that the parson who interpreted bis
speech put him up !o that meek remark, which
wo have heard hundreds of times at Methodist
exhibitions of converted touth Sea niggers and
Government aboriginal-station tea-meetings.
Spurgeon’s congregation recently pre-
sented him with a cheque for £1750, on account of
a little testimonial. He stated that “£1000 would
go to pay debts on the Jubilee house. The balance
would go to purchase a life-governorshio at St
Thomas’ Hospital, to almshouses, to the Poor
Ministers’ Fund, to colportage, and the purchase
of mangles and sewing-machines tor the necessi-
tous.” Well, he can afford it. If some of our holy
crowd tumbled into a similar piece of good for-
tune, they’d give nothing away but “ cheek,” ar d
call for a collection when they’d worn out the box-
iron.
Wc are sorry that Mr. F. R. Barlee, au ex-
premier of Western Australia, is dead. We didn’t
know him, but the decease of eminent men always
gives us pain. It makes us think of when our
time is to come, what a deal of inconvenience we
shall be put to. Another Barlee, brother of
F. R, this reminds us, died not long ago.
He was a journalist and short-hand writer.
He once got hold of a confiding printer
and brought out a publication called Once
a Week—which he published -once a week too
often. Some one called it Barlee-water, and then
it faded.
The Echo, the London radical evening
paper, congratulated the opponents of the Fran-
chise Bill in the House of Lords on the fact that
“Lord St. Leonards, who is a staunch Conservative,
will be liberated from gaol in time to record his
vote in favour of the resolution of Earl Cairns
Gall! Apropos, when his Lordship was brought up
to receive sentence, he came in the gaol-van. But
it is only fair to say that even the Radical news-
papers think the case against Lord St Leonards
was to an extent trumped-up, and that his offence
would have been amply punished by a tine, espe-
cially as he happens to be pretty hai’d up.
Nice thing ! Here’s Mr. Warburton Stent
sending his wife to Kreuznach, (in Germany,
Alfred), for the baths, accompanied by her
daughter, and escorted by General Low, and from
inquiries subsequently made, the daughter was
taken away, and “ these proceedings instituted.”
When the husband confronted his wife and the co-
respondent, she merely said she would “cast her
lot” with General Boom—we mean Low. Now,
how old do you think the General was ? 70 nett.
And this reminds us, that Madame Ferdinand de
Lesseps has — but after all, we don’t see . At
the same time, it’s rather curious that
Labouchere says “ an attempt is being
made to introduce into England the culture of the
Bartlett pear. It is a fruit that tempts every one
to take hold of it, but inasmuch as it overflows with
juice at the faintest handling, it is not popular.
This leads me to presume that the pear is named
after an ancestor of Mr. Ashmead-Bartlett, who
overflows with talk at the very faintest handling.
The Yankee farmers call it a ‘slobbery’ fruit,
and prefer what is known as the Clingstone or
Gladstone peach. We, too, prefer the Glalstone
to the Bartlett.” Ashmead-Bartlctt is the Yankee
gentleman who became Mr. Baronees Burdett-
Coutts.
This, from the Standard’s agony column,

The Queen is anxious for the early publi-
cation of the first instalment of Lord fhacons-
fleld's papers. “But,” remarks Truth, “ what-
ever is published will, of course, be most carefully
edited, or I suspect that the Queen would be
slightly astonished at the bitterness with which
Mr. Disraeli inveighed against the Court for many
years, and particularly against Prince Albert, who
greatly disliked him, and who, If ho had lived,
would have done his best to paevent him from
being Prime Minister. 1 wonder whether Lord
Rowton will publish the correspondence which
passed when, contrary to all precedent, Mr. and
Mrs. Disraeli were not invited to the State balls
and concerts.”
So F. H. Temple-Blaekwood, Dufforin’s
Earl and not Louise's consort, goes to India, in
succession to Ripon. Dufferin is lireworky, but
he has brains, aud is no bigot. If he does no worse
than Ripon, he will do. If he does no better than
Lytton and Northbrook, he will be a failure. The
fact is. as Bright says, tno place of the Viceroy of
India is too high, his powers too great. The duties
of the post are far greater than any human being
can adequately fulfil; the result being that the
peoples of India are neglected, while the ser-
vices ” aro coddled. Ripon saw this, and struggled
to remedy it, and failed, for in a matter ot this
kind a half success is scarce a whit better than
total failure. A largo measure of decentralisation
is the need of Hindustan.
FUNNY, VERY!
“Mr. Salomons was counsel, yesterday, for
a company who were the defendants in an action
for damages caused, it is alleged, by sparks or hot
ashes dropping from a locomotive engine, and the
learned Q.C. convulsed the court by remarking,
‘ We had the best spark arresters, ladies ex-
cepted.’ ’’—Lyre.
Oh. let him crack his little “ wheeze ”
To which but “ Wholesome Pun would stoop;
Such bosh will ever small minds please,
When “ set off ” by a “ jury-droop.
But, if this stuff, to perpetrate,
Elsewhere the Counsel were at pains;
The joker would be asked to state.
The hind of dog that stole his brains.
Mar wood, the late lamented English exe-
cutioner, once told this story to a small and select
company in a bar-parlour:—“ When I first com-
menced this business, I was rather in a fix, for my
missus was inclined to be religious; so when she
asked me why I was away from home so muco, I
told her I had been appointed registrar of births
and deaths for the district- She appeared satisfied,
so after two or three jobs I began to feci comfort-
able. I came home one night from an execution
at Newcastle, and, as my supper wasn’t quite ready,
I put my black bag (containing the rope and straps)
on a chair and came over here just to have a glass.
When I wont back she placed a nice steak before me.
‘ Haven’t you got any vegetables, Sally?’ I asked.
Taking a large covered vegetable dish from the
oven, she placed it on the table, remarking ‘ There,
William, I hope you will now enjoy your supper.’
Imagine my dismay, when, on raising the coyer,
my eyes rested on my rope and straps cut up Into
small pieces. The cat, or rather rope, was out of
the bag: and, before I could recover from my sur-
prise, she was out of the house, and it was months
before she would live with me again.”
We see that Mr. Cornwell, Secretary to the
Irish Post OlHce, was arrested by Meiklejohn, who
got into trouble through conspiring with Dru»-
covich and Palmer (those three men, the crack
inspectors of Scotland Yard) to rob a fool of a
woman named the Comtesso de Goncourt of
£10,000 by means of confederates, who are now
doing long terms of imprisonment. Meiklc-
john has, therefore, it seems, been taken
back in the service. Druscovich is in the
service of the Porte; and it was rumoured
that Palmer was in Australia under another name.
Cornwell, it will be remembered, brought a civil
action in Dublin to assert his innocence respecting
certain rumours; but he came out of it deplorably.
It was proved he consorted with men who were in
the habit of ‘‘going about in drag” (women's
clothes) ; and he was known in his set by the
soubriquet of “The Duchess.” The case against
him was very cleverly worked out, and he went
all to pieces directly. Now, it was mere rumour
that led to Cornwell’s arr-st in London: yet ru-
mours of a very extraordinary kind appear to
attract no official attention in Sydney.
“On three or four occasions,” blows Bu-
chanan, “I sat with him (the Philosopher of Chel-
sea), when no one was present but our two selves,
and never shall I forget the genius and power of
the man displayed in conversation. There was no
preaching, or lecturing, or ostentation of any kind.
His grand original thoughts f.nd ideas flowed away
from him in a natural stream of the finest talk I
ever listened to, public or private. Every power
he seemed to possess and wield with eas?. Wit,
humour, grotesque fun, terrible explosions of
scorn, a magnificent power of illustration, with
occasionally beautiful touches of the pathetic: all
these powers he exercised without the slightest
effort and with perfect conversational ease.”
O prophet of fustian, why give yourself away for
naught? How could any fellow, even a Thomas
Carlyle, terribly explode with scorn or flatulency,
or be grotesquely funny, “ with perfect conversa-
tional ease?’’ And why n t, while you were about
it, have told us tho exact propulsive power of his
number 19's? But what a picture, Thomas and
David by their own two selves —Auster at the ft.et
of CEolus learning the art of windbagism!
When “Edinburgh” was Admiral-Super-
intendent of Naval Reserves, he was ordered, with
his squadron, up the Baltic, under the orders of
Vice-Admiral Hood, with the Channel Squadron.
Hu remonstrated, though to no purpose, resting
his protest on the desirability of the Reserve
Squadron going on an independent cruise. Now,
however, that Edinburgh bosses the Channel
Squalron, he doesn’t see matters from the same
standpoint. The other day, when “my lords”
ordered the two squadrons to take their midsum-
mer cruise, Anthony Hoskins, who now commands
the Naval Reserves, objected to occupy a subor-
dinate position with an independent fleet—Edin-
burgh having assumed that he was entitled to take
the command of both squadrons—and Anthony
won bis point, to Alfred’s extreme vexation. And,
talking of Edinburgh, H.M.S. Vivid (the Devon-
port admiral’s steam yacht), whilst conveying him
to pay a visit down Plymouth Sound—but you
know tho story. And, talking of that lubber

Two facts, made public in these columns
about a couple of years ago, were recently com-
municated to the Argus by a London correspon-
dent and by “ The Vagabond.” respectively. Firstly
teat the late Adam Lindsay Gordon was not the
author of “ Voices from the Bush,” a poem attri-
buted to him by the compiler of Massiua’s edition
of his poems; and, secondly, that the verses be-
ginning—
“ They say that poison-sprinkled flowers
Are sweeter in perfume
Than when, untouched by deadly dew,
They glowed in early bioom,”
which are also printed as Gordon’s in the edition
referred to, are taken from Professor Aytoun’s
“ Bothwell,” and were included in Gordon’s works
merely on the strength of the fact that they were
scribbled, in the poet’s - handwriting, on the back
of a playing-card taken from his pocket after his
melancholy death. “ Voices from the Bush ” was
from the pen of Mr. Mowbray Morris, once a
Government House official at Adelaide, and lately
dramatic critic of the Times; and it was originally
published in an Adelaide paper.
That celebrated litigant, Mrs. Weldon, who
is to the English courts what the late Joseph Bragg
Slack used to be in Victoria and Madame Lotti
Wilmott was in N.S.W., said a neat thing the other
day in the Court of Queen’s Bench. *■ Gnder the
Married Women’s Property Act,” she observed,
“it seemed a woman might possess property of
any kind but her character.” And when the Judge,
alter she had spoken for several hours, asked her
how much longer she wt s going to be ? she replied
“ My lord, I never can tell a remark which, of
course, occasioned much laughter. Mrs. Weldon
has, regardless of the maxim that a man who is his
own lawyer has a fool for a client, always “per-
sonally conducted ” her own case. Perhaps, how-
ever, the adage in question does not apply to
women. Anyhow, the lady has so far been extra-
ordinarily successful in litigation. But she has
just commenced to learn that even a pretty and
l andsome woman—she is neither in any very
marked degree—can by constantly wagging a
rather rough tongue, and at the same time shelter-
ing herself beneath the privileges of her sex, be-
come as cordially hated by judges and jurymen as
she apparently is by several of those with whom
she has gone to law.
J udging from the way she shaped at the
start, Mrs. Oscar Wilde bids fair to knock all the
[esthetic stufiing out of her limp old man in some-
thing less than the proverbial three rounds. Slip-
ping across to “ Paree,” on their bridal tour, poor
Oscar caught a most infernal attack of the “Oh,
rays,” and, as he leaned over the steamer’s side the
doubled-up bridegroom called his bride to his side,
and exclaimed, between the acts, “ Darling, do not
grieve for me. I am—whaaoooop— I am dying,
deah; but there is a better— whoooo—whooo-oop
—a better world than this. See that you seep my
—hoooo—ah—whooop—my memory green, dearest,
will you not ?” “ I will, indeed,” replied the sob-
bing spouse; “and 111 have your grave kept
green, too, deah. Not one of those horrid, vulgar,
staring colours, but a nice, ripe-gooseberry green,
with terra-cotta palings, and such a duck of a
canary’s - gasn coloured tombstone, with a
monkey’s-smile su rah silk inscription on a scorched
banana ground. You just die, deah, and I’ll make
your grave the envy of every corpse this side of
the equatorial line.” This struck Oscar as carry-
ing enthusiasm for high art just a trifle too far,
and he accordingly girded up his loins, and took
soda-with-a-dark-bottom until he planted his
daisy-masher on what our own Andy would call
“ terra firmer.”
Earl Cairns, who moved the rejection of
Mr. Gladstone’s Franchise Bill, is one of those law-
yers who has graduated through chicanery into
piety. As a rule, a successful lawyer turns pious
as he nears his latter end. His conscience troubling
him, he seeks to ease it by bargaining with Heaven,
as men of notoriously bad Jives hope to avoid
damnation by bequests to build churches and con-
vert t he heathen. Ex-Lord Chancellor Cairns has
been so busy with the law and the prophets that
his domestic concerns have fallen into a state of
deplorable anaichy. His zeal for the conversion
of the negroes has lef him no time to look after
the morals of his chitterling heir, Viscount Gar-
movie. While the father has been slumming and
psalm-singing, the son has been toying with
actresses. The old man is of that type which in-
terprets the Scriptural phrase, “In my Father's
house there are many mansions,” as meaning there
is a House of Lords in heaven, and that, therefore,
it is right there should be artificial grades of
citizens on earth. The ex-Lord Chancellor is and
looks a pronounced snob. Born of humble parents
—his father kept a huckster's shop in the North of
Ireland—and having obtained a certain position, he
lo’es no opportunity of displaying his contempt
for the order from which he sprang. Moreover,
he is a pensioned pauper of the country to the
tune of £5000 per annum.
In the English Court of Appeal a motion
was made on behalf of Lord Colin Campbell for a
rule for a new trial in the case of Lady Colin
Campbell v. Lord Colin Campbell, on the ground
that the learned Judge of the Divorce Court had
misdirected the jury, and that the decision was
against the weight of evidence. The direction of
the learned Judge was to the effect that the com-
munication of disease by a husband to a wife with-
out informing her beforehand that he was unwell,
was legal cruelty. The husband and wife in
October, 1881, became engaged after a three days’
courtship. They were married the folio wing year.
Lord Colin Campbell at that time being out of
health, and it was arranged between them that
they should not sleep together, as it was forbidden
by the medical gentleman Lord Colin, on the
wedding tour, was accompanied by a hospital
nurse, who passed as ' ady Colin’s maid. In the
following year, according to Lord Colin’s case, a
dispute of a different nature to that raised in the
divorce case arose between the husband and wife,
and Lord Colin alleged that for the first time Lady
Colin suggested that she had cause to complain of
what had occurred after marriage. Their lordships
intimated that they would read Lady Colin Camp-
bell’s evidence in private, and then give judg-
ment. She is the daughter of Blood (Blood, Wolfe,
and Co.), the big brewers, and lie is eon to the Duke
of Argyll, and consequently brother-in-law to
Princess Louise. He shouldn’t have let her know
his secret. “ Blood will tell.”
When the great Dublin libel case (Corn-
wall v. O'Brien; was tried, Mr. O’Brien appeared
for plaintiff, and Mr. Justice O’Brien presided. So
that the O’Brien clan were in it pretty extensively.
The plaintiff was permanent secretary to the Dub-
lin Post Office, and the unmentionaole crime im-
puted to him by defendant, who is the editor and
proprietor of the Nationalist journal United Ire-
land, was, singularly enough, similar to that for
which a prominent Melbourne postal official was
recently tried. The making of the accusations, no
doubt, arose to an extent out of the bitter hosti-
lity entertained by the Nationalists against Eng-
lish officials in Dublin, but it was nevertheless
fully proved in court that the charges were true,
and a verdict was returned adverse to the plaintiff,
who has left the country. The existence of a hor-
rible state of immorality was disclosed during the
investigation, and the Nationalist members, with a
view to following up the advantage gained in
Court, urge Government to take criminal proceed-
ings against the parties concerned. The return of
a verdict for defendant was celebrated in Dublin
by processions and band-playing. The detective
who so successfully worked up O’Brien’s case was
Meiklejohn, the man who was some years ago sent
to prison with Inspector Druscovitoh, at the time
that accomplished officer and Mr. Froggatt, the
well-known London solicitor, got “ into trouble.”
Mr. O’Brien was fined £500 by the Court for com-
menting on the case while it was sub judice, but in
view of the verdict s iven it has been decided not
to press for payment of the penalty.
When about to leave Sydney, Archibald
Forbes told us all—or, perhaps, it wouldn’t, be cor-
rect to say that, as we didn’t all patronise his lec-
tures—that he was going to get married again. He
had the shockingly bad taste to inform his
audience, in as tender accents as he could muster,
that he was going away to “a great happiness”—
and so confirmed the newspaper rumour as to his
prospective second matrimonial venture. Well,
Mr. Archibald Forbes isn’t married yet, though he
left us a long while ago; and we now hear, on whst
should be very excellent authority indeed, that it
isn’t at all likely he will be soon, if indeed he is
ever again, a Benedict. Which only shows you
how imprudent it is, when you mean to get
married, to say anything about it in public. Some-
times, when you have made up your mind as to
matrimony, it is imprudent to let into the secret
even the girl you have selected. Sometimes again,
it is terribly dangerous to let her father know any-
thing as to your intentions, especially if he chances
to be an athletic gentleman of forty-five, who
weighs thirteen stone, and generally wears shoot-
ing-boots. Apropos, there has been in London
considerable excitement as to the grave charge of
plagiarism made in Adelaide against Mr. Forbes,
who is accused by a correspondent of the Adver-
tiser of having deliberately paraphrased a Times
article in a description of the London law-courts
printed under his own signature. Mr. Forbes’s
version of the matter—and there are sometimes
two sides to a question—has not yet been made
public in London, but the other version has, for
the Engineer has republished the two articles side
by side, and printed slips of them have been freely
circulated in the literary clubs.
Young Lord Savernake, who has just mar-
ried Miss Dolly Tester, of the Empire Theatre
(who, it seems, was only cne remove from a ballet-
girl), has just got what he was looking for; It’s
not difficult to prophesy his fate. All his grooms
and footmen will now have to be over sixty and
married (not that (hat makes much difference, now
we think of it!), and he will call in none but
female doctors. Of course, lots of stories will
reach him of the “pros.” she was mashed on at
various times ; how she bad followed this one
home in the snow; pawned her jewellery for that
one; of the nicknames she had; and even, through
the medium of spite and jealousy, he will learn all
the Ignoble secrets of the dressing-rooms; he will
be told the “ fake ” she did in this dance, and the
“frost” she was in that piece, until he will wish
he was dead—and she, too. And when he enters
his Clubs, chappies who “ have known the party ”
will grin behind their newspapers before welcom-
ing him; and old warriors, who only a few years
ago had “ tipped ” him at Eton, will openly call
him a d young fool. And what sort of a place
will his house be? It is said that Helen Faucet
(Lady Theodore Martin) has always made members
of the profession welcome at her house, and you
can kiss the bo°k on it that Miss Dolly Tester will
do the same. Only, as it happens, the class of
actors and actresses which Lady Martin receives,
and those which Lady S ivernake will invite, will
be of a totally different character The Empire
Theatre, by the way, where they were producing
with great splendour, was Tawhiao’s
favourite resort, chiefly on account of the anato-
mical character of the entertainment. So he must
often, we suppose, have gazed w th rapture upon
the symmetrical limbs of the present Lady Saver-
nake. The Alhambra he also much affected, and
had “atime” one night in the green-room, much lo
the amazement of the ballerinas. The New Zealand
party used to have the Royal box, and never “ part
a copper.” They are, we may add, doing London
under th • auspices of the Aborigines' Protection
Society I! 1
Sir John Hay—not our Sir John Hay—in a
letter to the Times, complains, with good reason,
of the favouritism shown to Lords Wolseleyana
Alcester as compared with the meagre recogni-
tion accorded to General Graham. A lot of facts
have come out in England which render even still
more inglorious the “great victory” won by
brawny Englishmen, raised on roast beef and plum
pudding, over wretched darkies, living on sherbet
and water-melons. For instance, one fact is that
at Tel-el-Kebir, the English troops were as numer-
ous as, even if they did not outnumber, the Egyp-
tian forces ; another fact is, that the celebrated
“midnight charge” at Kassassin, was a mere
brutal slaughter—it was not a light, but an abso-
lute battue of blackfellows. The military parade
of Lord Wolseley in Egypt was child’s play, but
the two battles won by General Graham by hard
and desperate fighting against a determined and
resolute foe, showed bravery of no ordinary kind.


The Test of Actual Trial. — This is
what proves the merit of a preparation. The pro-
prietor of Green’s August Flower, knowing- its
valuable properties, meets this test boldly by pre-
paring sample bottles of this remedy, which are
sold at 6d. This enables doubters to try its virtues
at a trilling expense. August Flower is a panacea
for Dyspepsia and all disorders of the Liver, in-
cluding Biliousness, Indigestion, Side Headache
Costiveness, &c., &c. Three doses will relieve any
of the above, and a faithful use will certainly cure.
No medicine in the world has ever given such
proof of its merits. Druggists recommend it with
perfect confidence and physicians prescribe it
regularly. Price for full-sized bottles 3s. fid. Sold
by all druggists.
»Court influence” accounts for if. all. The bat-
ting” of Alexandria and Tel-el-Kehir were as in-
glorious as they were for our army bloodless.
What other motive, it is asked, could there have
been than the glorification of the Duke of Con-
naught, who, as the calculating Wolseley took
rare to inform Her Majesty, instanter by tele-
graph, “ led his brigade bravely,” &c. The Court
would seem to care very little for sterling merit;
rank, position, and influence are the one prevail-
ing thought in its mind. Nothing could be more
scandalous than the case of Lord Chelmsford,
*• whose gross incapacity and negligence caused
the defeat of the English in Zululand, and the
massacre of a whole regiment; yet, Lord Chelms-
ford has now been appointed to the lucrative sine-
cure of Lieutenant of the Tower, through the in-
fluence of the Court.” The uns.Hlor-like blunder-
ing of “ Admiral ” Prince Leiningen (who has been
only two and a half years at sea) “ consigned three
persons to a watery grave„in the Solent,” yet this
Koval personage is now going to hoist his Hag at
the Nore, despite the superior claims of scores of
gallant olficers. 1 he “ glaring imbecility ” of Gen-
ial Burrows lost us the battle of Maiwand, in
Afghanistan, and led to the slaughter of the 66th
Regiment. He is still unrewarded, and it is sug-
gested that someone should whisper in the Queen’s
ear that he looks with a jealous eye on the favours
neaped upon the other incapables.
Mr. Henniker Heaton’s story concerning
his intervie v with the Frenchman who, having
found his wife unfaithful, killed her lover, whose
liver he fried and forced her to eat, is good up to a
certain point. But it goes too far. Henniker
surely doesn't wish one to believe that any well-
educated Frenchman who had ever dined at the
Trois Freres ” would have been guilty of so great
an outrage upon the laws of cuisinerie, to say
nothing of the offence against politeness involved,
as to adopt so brutal and so English a method of
dealing with the foie d'amant in question. The
Gallic gentleman was, it seems, on account of his
little “adventure,” transported to New Caledonia,
but was on his way back to La Belle France a free
man w en Mr. Heaton chanced upon him. We
remember having road in Figaro about a French-
man who, when acting as host, left the room to
prepare some coffee, and, on returning, found his
guest kissing his wife. That Gaul also took a
culinary revenge, though of a somewhat different
sort to that of the gentleman who, according to
Mr. Heaton, gave to the erring lady a friandise
concerning the proper preparation of which there
is, we hope, no competent'authority in London,
save His Majesty King Tawhiao. He didn’t kill the
lover. He merelv drank the guest s cup of coffee
and shouted: “ThereI I have my revenge! I
have taken all And then there is the
story of the other Frenchman, who, having sur-
prised his wife in the embraces of an Englishman,
broke his rival’s umbrella and jumped on his hat,
exclaiming, “ Hurra! I have had my revenge! It
is raining much, and he will soon have to go out!”
One can just credit these anecdotes, but unless
Hr. Heaton assures us that the wife of hia friend
was an Englishwoman and accustomed to Sydney
boarding-house cookery, we must respectfully but
tirmly decline to believe the story, which is even
less credible than that told by Winwood Reade
about a certain Princess of Central Africa whose
habit it was to embrace a lover one day and eat
him the next. In short, we cannot, without at
least a cartload of additional testimony, lend our
endorsement to a “ romance of real life,” ivalling
in grimness that attached to the fiendish Count-
does he come from “ Haddon Hall,” or from
Irving’s “ Tales of the Alhambra who one day
at table asked his wife “ how sh j liked the dish she
had just eaten?” and, on being told that “it was
very sweet,” coolly informed her that “It should
Indeed have been sweet, for it was the heart of
your lover, Raoul de Courcy.” There’s no poetry
about the liver. Henniker should have made
toe Frenchwoman’s wife eat her lover's heart.
The dapper Morgan, of Queensland, had,
the other day, a “bone to pick” with an English
solicitor. The latter was about six feet two, but,
though W. P. M. is only five feet six, he has a
broad chest and a square jaw. He smilingly en-
tered the office of his English friend, a smug, well-
to-do, gentlemanly rascal, who makes £10,000 a
year by his profession, and said, “ How do you do,
Mr. Pnggit? I see that that business is finished,
and now that is completed I have very great
pleasure in coming here, and expressing my
opinion concerning it.” The bulky Mr. Priggit
here looked up, and as he saw that Morgan’s eyes
were dancing, and that Morgan was “ washing his
hands with invisible soap,” and looking ex-
tremely pleasant, he (Priggit) likewise looked de-
lighted, as if in anticipation of the forthcoming
compliment. “Yes,” continued Morgan, “1 have
very great pleasure in expressing my opinion, Mr.
Priggit; for you,” and here Morgan's face clou ed
as the sky clouds in a tro Heal thunderstorm, “ are
the d est scoundrel I ever met in all my ex-
perience, even though I have lived fin North
Queensland. Yes, sir, you are the biggest liar and
tho paltriest thief i have ever met inside or out-
side a door wearing a brass plate. No, you need ’t
call your clerks and messengers to have me re-
moved, for if you put your lying lips to th t
speaking-tube I’ll put my fist through your scull,
and grind your bones on your own door-vtep.
You tried to ‘ have ’ me. and you didn't suc-
ceed. Good morning, Mr. Priggit, good morning.”
On another occasion, Morgan interviewed a
firm of London engineers with reference to
some work he wished done, and the head of the
establishment made a deal of difficulty about the
matter, remarking at the same time: “However,
if there's a firm in London that can do the job,
we’re the people, for we've been established since
the time of Henry VIII.” “ Did you know Henry
VIII.?" asked Morgan, without a smile on his face.
“ No,” aus wered tne alleged engineer, who thought
that in Au tralia, where Morgan came from, they
might not teach history; “I’m talking, not about
myself, but about my firm.” “Ah, I see. But,
never mind,” observed the little man; “I think
your firm are a bit too old for me. uood-bye.”
Morgan is still uncivilised, though he has been
fifteen months in England. He was at the orna-
mental water in St. James’ Park the other day,
when a man came up and aoked him the way some-
where. “Go round this water-hole,” replied the
Queenslander, “and turn to the right when you
got to the other lagoon.” Such is the deplorable
condition to which a man is reduced by living in
the wilds of the North.
Everyone has heard of—for it has been
well advertised — that stupendous volume of
twaddle, “ Lady Srassey’s Cruise of the Sunbeam,”
the gentlest thing that can be said about which
is that its style reminds one of Her Majesty’s ex-
quisite literary ventures. Speaking of the Bras-
seys, a correspondent of an English paper writes:
—“Tom Brassey is as thorough and out-and-out a
nobody as a man can well be. His father managed
to make a fortune, and some few years ago left his
son, the present * Sir Tom,’ a stupendous fortune
in land and funded investments, and an annual
income greater than that possessed by many a
duke. Then Tom marripd a fashionable wife with
plenty of push and gush. He was plain Mr. Brassey
then, and she a simple 4 Mrs.,’ but she made up her
mind she would not let things stay in that way
long. She was bound to have a title. If she was
not a lady in realiry and in accordance with the
accepted rules which govern Society and the Eng-
lish definition of one, she would be made one by
law. So she set to work doing all sorts of things
to get her name into the papers and make people
talk about her. Tom bought a place down in
Sussex, as close to the edge of the grand old estate
of the Earl of Ashburnham as he could, and put
up a great, vulgar, staring house o i it,.a house
that is the laughing-stock of the neighbourfiood,
and an eye-sore to everyone of taste who passes
within view of its exterior. In deference, most
likely, to their lack of any progenitor who came
over with the Conqueror, they called the place
Normanhurst Court, But its name is the only an-
tiquity it had. The carpets were new, the furni-
ture was new, the frescoes were new, the carriages
were new, the family silver was new as the most
recent dated 4 Hall ’ mark of the Goldsmiths’ Com-
pany could make it, and the crest which decorated
it was the latest invention of the obliging gentle -
men who conduct the affairs of the Herald’s College,
nut that did nut matter. The Brasseys were new
themselves, and that made it all right. So down
to Normanhurst Court they went and installed
themsilves. The county people did not seem to
lake to them at all, and, like the Sassoons, when
they began their social career at Brighton in 1870,
they had rather uphill work at first. The Ashburn-
ham family, whose magnificent park of centuries’
growth the aspiring windows of Normanhurst
overlooked, set their faces against them at once
and refused to recognise them in any way. People
of less push than Mrs. Brassey would have been
crushed by the succession of snubs to which she
was treated by the members of this most ancient
of English families. But Mrs Brassey did not care.
Regardless of refused invitations and no return of
hospitalities, the Brasseys kept on entertaining and
giving dinners to whoever would accept their hos-
pitality. Mrs. Brassey knew howto attract men,
and if you get the men of the house into your
clutches, the rest of the family will soon follow.
Dinners cooked to perfection, and wines of the
rarest vintage flowing like water, will not stay long
unnotic d in these days of sensual gratification,
where palates and stomachs rule where heads and
hearts used to do. The county magnates—except
the Ashburntiams, who have always kept aloof—
and people of importance in the neighbourhood
bega to thaw. Bach week the newspapers con-
tained increasing lists of great people who had
dined at Normanhurst, and dined in a manner
they seldom dined anywhere else. Invitations,
heretofore ignored, were now things to seek; and
people who dined once were only too glad to come
again—as long, at any rate, as the chef remained at
his post, and ’55 Chateau-Margaux and Perrier
Jouet magnums were uncorked without stint. All
the way from Marlborough House, the Prince of
Wales sniffed thearoma of the Normanhurst Court
cuisine and the bouquet of the Chateau-Yquem,
and he soon signified his willingness to t.ame a
time for a visit there. What mattered it to him if
the man at the top of the table was a * mushroom
of hasty growth’ and his wife an over-dressed
woman, it the sauce tartaro tasted as well, and
there was none the less crust to the port? Under
such circumstances, it is rather a shame to think
that the house where he stays or accepts enter-
tainment has its social status tlxed, and that other
people of more refined and proper tastes have in a
sense to accept his judgment of peoole as one to
follow. However, since then the Brasseys have
gone on daily becoming more popular and talked
about. Mr. Brassey went in for politics, and was
returned a member of the House of Commons for
Hastings at the last general election, and when Mr.
Gladstone formed his Cabinet he made Tom Rras-
sey ihe Civil Lord of the Admiralty, the one whose
duties go only to victualling ships and things
like that. In 1883, Tom Brassey was made a
baronet. Mrs. Brassey’s fondest wisu was con-
summated. She was a ‘ Lady ’ at last. Doubtless
she took all the credit of the honour to herself.
She fancied her ‘literary ’ ways, her famous yacht
Sunbeam and ‘ Cruise ’ from her own pea had mot e
to do with the acquisition of the long-coveted
title than anything else. But the fact of the matter
is simply this: Brassey, like hundreds of lately
made lords and baronets who have preceded him
in the first step, gained the distinction because of
his wealth. In these days, let any man who is un-
commonly rich go into politics and show an apti-
tude for them that would be considered but
mediocre ability in a poor man, and let his life be
fairly moial, decent, honest, and upright, and he
will sooner or later be made a baronet or peer. A
baronetcy is generally the first honour given.
Money is power, and Prime Ministers, who have
the making of peers in their hands, know how easy
a blatant leveller is turned into a stanch adherent
of monarchy and firm supporter of Royalty by the
simple conferring of a peerage or baronetcy. It is
curious how quickly a title will change a mau. At
ab events, Tom Brassey was made a ‘tir,’ and now
he is to be made a 4 Lord.' But whatever he was,
or is, or will be in name, in reality he is a man
who would never have been heard of if it had not
been for his money. When such men are made
noblemen, what must one expeffl And yet it is
an astounding fact, when one comes to look into
it, that many of the families which we are accus-
tomed to call 4 great,’ and which still retain under
their ancient titles a place in the peerage, are re-
presented at their heads by men who have no more
blood-right to the family cognomen than has a
man named Smith to be called Jones. This is the
kind of thing which shakes one in one’s precon-
ceived idea as to the stability of 4 family,* the
purity of blood, and the directness of lineage of
the British nobility, and make one think, after all,
what are the odds if men like Brassey do get in
among them? Brarsoy, at least, bears .his father’s
name. That much can be said for him. And if he
lacks the polish and refinement of such men as the
Duke of Richmond or the Earl of Macclesfield, he
can seek consolation in the reflection that the first
of his line was neither the illegitimate son of
Charles II., by Louise de Querouailie, a passie
mistress of Louis XIV. of France (as wa j the first
Duke of Richmond), a Lord Caancellor of
England who was fined £30,000 for corruption in
office (as was the firs: Earl of Macclesfield).”

and Peter Campbell), we are beginning to hjve
grave doubts on the score of John the Baptist.
The point chiefly to be considered is—did he go
and preach In the wilderness clad in a raiment of
camel's hair and live on locusts and wild honey; or
did he utter his ministrations got up in an elon-
gated “ banger,” and reside in the Coffee Pa'ace of
the period? We are constrained to think he did
the latter, and that an ex-waitress there had her
own reasons, subsequently, for demanding his
head upon a charger. Herod, too, had probably
found out that there were always plenty of £1
notes in John’s P.O.-box, and that all the physic he
used yearly for the natives was a bottle and a-half
of condemned pain-killer, and, therefore, lost all
sympathy for the evangelist; but, even then, as
the theory goes, he still held his hand. But, no
sooner did the King behold that John, not content
with hp.ving blossomed all at once into the “cele-
brated lecturer, journalist, a.ud free-thought ex-
ponent,” announced himself as an “auctioneer and
land agent” into the bargain, than his Majesty
yielded to solicitations of the ex-waitress (now
in the ballet) and straightway ordered the decapi-
tation of John and the presentation of his head
(with strict injunctions to “ bring back the plate ”)
to the lady. We shall be happy to debate this sub-
ject with any sober person over the rank of a
Dean.
Far away in northern Lismore we have a
literary brother whose heart Is sad because of the
burden of the Press. Here is some of his bitter
irony:—"The newspaperman is always the spoilt
pet of the public—as he gets everything for
nothing—and clothed in purple and fine linen,
lives upon pound cake, drinks champagne, and
enjoys his butterfly existence while it lasts—as
those the gods love generally die young—or should
he get old or troublesome, and take to writing
leaders about the Mud Age, or other disagreeable
topics, he is generally pole-axed, or sent to the
lunatic asylum.” After reading which it will be
apparent that editing papers on the Richmond
niver is a few times more unsatisfactory as an oc-
cupation than bees’-nesting in a wood full of
wasps. It makes a man cynical and sarcastic,
which no man should be. Cynicism and sarcasm
have a tendency to sour the stomach and derange
the digestion. Telegrams are the chief trouble of
this Lismoro editor; he can’t get them until the
facts they convey have recoded into the dim and
mythic era of history. But, being a man not easily
daunted, he came down to Sydney, and, meeting
some leading Lismore residents here, asked them
to go with him to the Postmaster-Oeneral. They
refused, evidently not caring—so he says himself—
“to be seen in company with a newspaper man.”
Fancy there being anybody in Lismore with
dignity enough to be damaged by being
seen with a wielder of the Archimedean lever I
Yet ho is quite right. We have met
such people ourselves, and have noticed that
they always manage to keep respectable company
except on a tine day. Then then cannot (let rid of
their shadows! The Lismore litterateur, however,
to use his own forcible expression, "faced the
forlorn hope alone.” He goes on to say: "After
being shown the way upstairs by the gentleman in
uniform who paces the portico at the ueneral Post
Office, we asked an official if we could see the
Postmaster-General, but were informed he could
not be seen that day. We then asked to see the
next in authority, but were informed that he had
gone for a holiday. We then asked to see the next
in power, and after being spoken to rather sharply
by the messenger, who evidently thought we were
looking for a Government billet, we were shown
into a room where an official was seated—whom
we found much more civil and po’ite than bis
subordinates outside, even though we were not
dx-essed in the latest masher costume, and did
not sport diamond rings on every finger.”
This is very pretty writing in its way and a striking
proof that the best quality of rum made on the
Richmond River is not exported. But it also re-
veals that the writer knows but little of the way
in which the woi-ld is governed when he expects
Govex-nment officials to be civil and polite. They
are not paid to be civil and polite. They are paid
to pick their teeth and pare their nails in the in-
tervals of bluffing the public. Also because a
member of Parliament boards with their aunt. So
that we are not surprised to read the result of the
interview. We quote again: “Returning our
thanks for the kinuness shown us, we retired, feel-
ing that alone we did it; and have since reaued or r
reward, as wo have the satisfaction of finding by
experience that these Press messages now come
worse than over.” Of course. Precisely. The
Lismore editor should have got somebody who
possessed influence with the messenger to intro-
duce him to that dignitary, who would have intro-
duced him to the counter-clerk, who might have
had strength enough to point out the chief of the
counter-clerks, who, perhaps, would have sent a
boy to show him the next in authority, who, perad-
venture, would have told him to' go to blazes, and
so settled the matter at once. That’s the way
busiciss is done down here.
WHY WE DIE
Before The Alloted Period
of Threescore Years
and Ten.
( Hall's Journal of Health )
What person of mature years does not at this
season involuntary go back to childhood’s days,
when Spring cleaning applied as well to our inter-
nal structures as to the household, and the purifi-
cation of the blood, of the accumulated distem-
pers and impurities of the year, became a duty
which brooked neither argument nor delay? What
doses of sulphur and molasses, of salts and senna,
of dock and dandelion, of sarsaparilla and winter-
green, and many other nauseating possets, remark-
able only for their horrible taste, we used to take
every spring! Whence the custom or the autho-
rity for this annual purification of the blood we
know not, but the necessity lor it seems so firmly
established by the practice of our best physicians
and the education of generations that we may
feel safe in accepting it as extremely beneficial, if
not actu illy necessary. This, however, wo do
know, that, whether existing as an impurity of
the blood or as a constii utlonal weakness trans-
mitted through generations, there exists in certain
familioj and individuals a debilitating element that
undermines the constitution, saps its vitality, and
renders life prematurely brief. The old etox-y of
the two brothers is a case in point. John led a life
of exposure, smoked and drank to excess, lived
high. Kept late hours, never thought of caring for
his health, and died at ninety-three, in lull pos-
session of his faculties to the moment of dissolu-
tion. James was brought up under more favour-
able auspices. He was taugnt to be temperate In
all things, to eschew tobacco and liquors, to be
careful in diet and exercise, to avoid exposure,
and to rise early and retiroearly. In consequence
of which he died in hearty old age, floated with
the coatings of ninety-live years.
We speak of such people as having strong con-
stitutions; and we are right. The more we inves-
tigate the matter, the more firmly will we adhere
t j this c-.nclusiou: that it is the amount of vital
energy born in a man that enables him to live the
full turee-score years and ten. Now, what is this
vital element? Blood, undoubtedly, since it is
this fluid that nourishes the system and maintains
the life of its several parts. In this blood, handed
down through generations, or self-incurred, exists
an element of weakness or debility, which we call
consumption, scrofula, rheumatism, or kidney
disease, because it assumes the form of each in
turn, or in dilferent families; but, by whatsoever
name it may be known, it is a vitiating poison,
that infests the blood and circulating fluids, and
weakens the delicate machinery of iito. Insidi-
ously it develops itself year after year, fastening
on tuij organ and then on that, until the vitality
or resistance of the patient is gone, and death en-
sues. The inheritance of this impure taint is so
widespread among all nations and peoples that,
could all the plagues which have devastated the
earth be combined as one destructive force, they
could not create a tithe of the misery and suffer-
ing for all time and generation inflicted by its in-
heritance and dissemination.
Its direful effects may be noticed in the slender
figure, lackin <• proportions ; small, weak, and
crooked limbs; pale countenance, often of trans-
parent wh'teness, sometimes with a hectic flush or
unnatural redness of the cheeks; sometimes a yel-
low color about the mouth, blue rings around the
eyes, which are usually large, and of a bluish-
white, particularly when tending to the lungs; the
eyelids are frequently swollen, Inflamed, ana dis-
charge viscid matter; the nose is swollen, red, or
shloing ; the teeth are unnaturally white or
covered with foul secretions; tho breath is fetid;
the bowels irregular, tho stomach sour, and the
appetite capricious, at one time feeble, at anotner
ravenous; the muscles and flesh are soft and weak;
or it round and full, fail, through inherent weak-
ness, in performing their olHces without fatigue;
the limbs and joints are weak; indifference, indo-
lence, and debility, with Incapacity tor prolonged
mental or physical exertion, mark the daily life of
the person; the powers of the mind of the scrofu-
lous or disease tainted may be at-times brilliant
and strong, but not enduring; the body may be
capable of great effort, but of short duration. It
is undermined, sapped, and debilitated by a poison
that rankles in tho blood, bones, and tissues, that
permeates every avenue of the body, that robs
the brain, the lungs, the llvor, the kidneys of their
proper nourishment, and saturates them with a
contaminating fluid that rots out their vitality,
Ailing the body with foul corruptions. Thus it is
often without the knowledge of the subject that
cancer, canker, consumption, ulcerations of the
liver, kidneys, and uterine system, rheumatism,
neuralgia, chronic pains and 1 inflammations, fe-
male disorders, internal ulceration and decay,
dropsy, dyspepsia, emaciation, and debility fasten
upon the system and pave the way for a rapid de-
cline. The presence of the virus r-ndors the
system less able to combat infectious or malarial
diseases, to resist prolonged mental or physical ex-
ertion or serious accidents. Tho blood having no
longer the power to nourish and sustain, the de-
pressed condition of the electrical or nerve force
invites disease, and the system becomes a ready
prey to epidemics, malarial fevers, and prostrating
influences
My materia medica is simple, wholesome, and
sensible. It consists of three articles—nutritious
aud easily digested food, plenty of fresh air and
exercise, and Outicura Resolvent. The Resolvent
is a combination of new and original medicinal
a?ents. by Weeks & Potter, chemists and drug-
gists, Boston, assisted by the late Ur. Gray.
It is scientific and positive in its action. In forty
minutes it may be detected in the blood, saliva
sweat, milk, and urine, proving that it has made
the entire circuit of the fluids of the body. Hero
it meets with the corrosive elements, constituting
blood poisons, chemically unites with them, form-
ing harmless compounds, which gradually pass
from the system. As a blood purifier, diuretic
and aperient lor tho purification of tne blood anu
i ha curing of constitutional humors, as well as for
the purpose of a Spring medicine, no medical com-
position or so-called blood purifier, or sarsaparilla
syrup of modern times, can compare with it. As a
sue, innocent, aud efficacious compound, unsur-
passed in activity and power, 1 recommend the
Cuticura Resolvent to all who are constitutionally
weak, or subject to maladies originating in impure
or tainted blood. It combines four great proper-
ties in one medicine, acting at once upon tne di-
gestive organs, blood, kidneys, and bowels. Ftr
those who wake with sick headache, furred
tongue, biliousness, dyspepsia, torpidity of the
liver, constipation, piles, high-colored urine
inflamed kidneys, feverish symptoms, and
other congested conditions requiring a speedy
gentle, and safe aperient and diuretic, nothing in
medicine cm possibly equal it.

ORIENTAL GOLD
Is the latest discovery of Science and the grandest
achievement of the alchemist s art. It looks like
gold, it is as heavy as gold, and 1th more enduring.
None but an expert can detect the difference, and
then only by the severest teste. Ornaments made
from this new composition arc equal In design and
general appearance to those made of the finest
18-carat gold, and yet wo sell them at but a tithe of
the Cos t of the genuine goods.
Remember that we do not pretend that Oriental
Gold is anything but a composition of pure metals;
but we do allirm ihat it is so perfect an Imitation
ot the sterling golo as to almost defy detection.
Jewellery made of it may bo worn anywhere, and
the closest inspection willonly strengthen thecon-
victlon that it is real gold. So perfect is It, and so
large has our trad s become, that jewellers through-
out the colonies are complaining of the dullness
in trade, and are constantly writing to us to secure
our goods for their own customers. Hut as we are
Sole Agents for these colonies, we prefer to deal
directly with the public. All of our Oriental Gold
Jewellery is made to our order, and is stamped
with our trade mark. You can order anything
from a Scarf Pin to a Watch and Chain, and It will
be sent Post Free, and at our risk, on receipt of
price.
SPECIALLY OBSERVE.
Should you be dissatisfied with your investment
after inspecting the articles, re-pack them at once
and send them back to us. If this is done within
two days—or where mails are few, by the first post
after receipt, and the articles are not injured—we
will return ihe money, deducting only the trifle
expended on postage. You can keep any one
article and return the rest, and we will refund the
money for the articles not retained. Fair dealing
is our motto, and we bind ourselves to give satis-
faction. Examine our catalogue, and sendin your
order for what you may require.
N.B —We find that, through an error on the part
ot the manufacturers, we are overstocked with
Brooches, and for the purpose of making a rapid
clearance of that lino of Goods, wo will send to
any customer (post free, if at a distance) on receipt
of Five Shillings (5s.), a really exquisite Oriental
Gold Brooch, equal in design, finish, and appear-
a ice to & Five Guinea Brooch ot the sterling metal.
This offer holds good for a few weeks only, and is
made as much for the purpose of advertising our
Oriental Jewellery by sample as for any other
reason ; for the Brooches will keep, and they are
of the latest design. “To see is to want,” Is a
saying so applicable to our goods, that it pays us.
in the long run, to forward to any person a sample
Brooch at cost price. Examine our catalogue, and
write to us or call on us for what you may desire.

th /n 1 wondering if “ any of them fellows is him ;
8 nt Belch was not to be seen. The managers had
aim bidden away In the coal-hole under the stage
* him dark until the right moment came.
They were afraid, perhaps, he’d slope with the
memento without making a speech, and they
that if he did once get awav and regain his
hnat in the bay there wasn't anything round this
b “r, of woods could ever catch him. bp they
Sent him locked up until the first interval came
nnwhen Mr. Musgrove or Mr. Garner (we don t
know them apart) appeared before the curtain
innl and announced that he took great pleasure
to the audience Mr. William Beach,
champion of the world. &c.. &o. Of course, every-
Sv yowled like a democratic convention of tom-
o+a and then the orator went back to the wings,
loosened the hand-cults, and led the prisoner lorth.
It was a trying moment for the hero of the
Parramatta. During his long colonial career, he
had always borne a reputation above reproach and
had enioved the conlidence and respect of his
friends. 'Now he was compelled to confront that
each one of whom seemed cla-
mouring bfs blood. Crest-fallen, with eyes on
the floor, and his right hand in his pocket, he stood
there the picture of repentance and despair. Could
his heart have spoken, it would have said, I m
onrrv I beat him. I didn’t mean to. It was an
accident. If you let me off this time, I won’t do it
again.” Still the populace seemed clamouring for
revenge. The victim’s face flushed. Finally his
Hsrht hand was withdrawn from his pocket. It
sought his ear. which it rubbed gently, as though
somebody was talking about it. Then he leaned
nVer sideways, reached down and scratched his
loff leg It was a picture for a painter. Unally, a
screech from the gallery that sounded as if some-
hod? had trampled on the devil’s tail, brought the
eves of the culprit to bear in that direction. The
gods met his gaze and inspired hum. Then the man
who had introduced him proceeded to pass sen-
tence upon him It was quickly oyer. For the
tirst time the prisoner's lips parted. He spoke.
The silence of death reigned in the theatre. Men
„nd women held their oreath to catuh tne first
words that might fall from the unfortunate man s
Hob. It was only a whisper and tew could catch it.
But these wore the words, “ I wish to h -11 was
out of this.” Then in a louder voice he exclaimed,
“I don’t know much about soeakiu’, but when it
comes to rowin’. I’m all thar.” This was too much,
if was more than human nature could endure.
One Ion s deep toned growl of vengeance swelled
«o from the pit, only to be augmented as it reached
the dress circle, and capped with a hurricane of
screeches from the gallery above. The audience
arose as one man. A rope was quickly brought,

The boss is always hopping on to our neck,
tlut perhaps you would like to know something’
about “The Merry Duchess,” which was put on at
the Royal last Saturday night. You would ? Well.
•‘The Merry Duchess” is a new comic opera by
George U. Sims and Frederick Clay. Nellie Stewart
nlaved in the title role, and the production of the
mece was signalised uy the first appearance iu
Sydney of Mis- Grade Plaistead, and the first ap-
pearance with the Opera Company of Messrs.
Philip Day and Mans Phillips. There isn t much
plot to the piece, but what there is of it runs like
this The Duchess of Epsom Downs is the daughter
of Sir Lothbury Jones. She has a favourite mare
called Damozei. who has won the Derby and is
entered for the St. Leger, Freddy Bowman (Hans
Phillips), the great English jockey, is booked to
ride the mare, and the Du°hess has fallen desper-
ately in love with him. An attempt is made to
poison the mare O' the eve of the race, but this
doesn’t “ connect.’ and, as a last resort, the touts
persuade Lord Johnnie (Fettle Browne), whose
servant Fred Bowman really is, to claim him tor
another horse. Lord Johnnie is also in love with
the Duchess, and she has promised to marry
him if her mare is beaten tor the St. Leger.
She hopes to win, for she wants to wed
the loekey; and, of course, is in more trouble than
an old maid with a man under the bed, when Lord
Johnnil claims the successful rider for his own
horse At last Lord Johnnie relents, and then the
touts insult Freddie, until he strikes one of them,
and the police lock him up lor breacn of the peace.
The infuriated populace, led on by the Duchess,
storm the cal iboose, and poke the door down with
their walking-sticks. Freddie rushes out, skins

wins the race. And right here we wa-at to tell you
that the set-mery with which the piece is mounted
is worth going to look at. The one representing
the cornfields at Muddleham was particularly real-
istic but the gleaners were dressed in entirely too
gaudy costbme for the occasion. The Doncaster
racecourse, too, was so cleverly represented that
in the race scene the field of horses were seen to
get away w 8 ell together with Damozei forging
ateadilv a-head until she came around at last
winner of the race. This was as neat a stage trick
as we have seen in many a day. or night t ither, and
nothing but the fact that Beach is Champion kept
ui from getting up and offering six to one on tue
chestnut. * * •

Grade Plaisteacl was received with ap-
plause and a shower of bouquets. The shower
wasn’t particularly showerful, lor the flowers
were handed up from the orchestra; but they
were pretty and fragrant, and that’s all you want
in bouquets. Sydney play-goers always receive
a new celebrity witn open arms, and there wasn t
a man in the audience who wouldn t have received
Grade that way it he could. If you weren t out
on Saturday night, wo must tell you that Miss
Plaistead isn't much bigger than a small bottle ol
champagne, but she's just as lively and sparkling
when she gets in front of the footlights And she
sings ever so prettily. Wo liked her best in the
bird song in the opei ing scene, wheu she trilled
away like a thrush with a broken leg, until we
almost wished we had an empty cage somewhere
to put the little warbler in and spirit her away to
some enchanted isle where nobody but us should
ever hear her sing. But there A man always
does seem to prefer what he can’t get, and doesn t

constancy of human nature; but we don't exactly

No, we haven’t; but MissIPlaisted oomes
from America, you know, and every time we see
an American lady we can’t help thinking of the
old mountaineer’s daughter that we once tried to
court over in Colorado. She was rather a healthy-
lookm? damsel, six feet tall, and could shoot a
rifle or skin a de«r with any man on the new dig-
gings. And she had red hair, but that didn’t mat-
ter. After a fellow’s been in the Rocky Moun-
tains a month or two, he’s got an anpetite for any-
thing. Her name was Sarah (“ Sal,” for short), but
we used to like to think of the time to come, when
love should mellow her practical nature to such
an extent that we needn’t fear to call her our Little
Mountain Daisy. We didn’t dare do this at the
outset, for she was right on the muscle, and it was
generally believed that she could “ put a head j
on any man in the camp. One day, when we
couldn’t stand it any longer, we sat down and
wrote to her. Our letter ransomothing like this:—
The golden banners of retreating day
Are faintly moving o er the mountain’s crest.
The blazing monarch of the skies has swept
Beyond the horizon of sight, and left
A purple kiss of love upon the cbeek
Of each proud daughter of the Snowy Range.
Fantastic shadows glint and glance along
The lines my eager pen pursues, and in
Their carol wild and free 1 caich again
The magic light that dances ever in
Your roguish eyes and sends a holy gleam
Athwart the gloomy cavern of my soul.
How strange it seems that I should love; for I
Had thought myself a misanthrope To me
All men and women were alike, and in
My blindness all were bad; but by some spell—
Some secret magic of your own - new-born
EmoGons thrill my soul to bid Despair
Look up and put new sinews In the arms
Of Hope. Once I had thought to climb the hills
Of Truth, and walk with kiuored spirits there—
The dizzy heights where none but beings of
Immortal faith and courage dare to tread.
To taint to fall, to fail of all I hoped
Was but the just and proper sequel to
My halting faith. To-night my noart is sad:
My soul, like some dark night-bird, wings its way
A-down the steeps of life, where scattered lie
The fragments of full many a joyous dream
Of love. And there ’twould brood. But you have
come
To drive away the vulture of regret.
Now once again my doubting soul looks up;
Ambition thrills my palsied nerves, and I
Can dare again the cruel storm-bursts of
An adverse fate. Will you not grant your love
And prayers to bid me God-speed in the race
Which lies before ? May 1 not bind your soul
To mine by ties of love so strong tbat no
Untoward blast can shatter any dreams
Of gladness that the years may bring to us ?
If so, I'll storm the citadel of Fame
And place the banner of eternal Joy
Upon the turret-top of Truth.
We awaited the answer with all the anxiety of a
man who expects to catch the small-pox. The
next day it came. We hastened awav to our cabin
with beating heart, and tore the yellow-covered
missive open. It read as follows: —“ Young feller.
You ar eviduntli a Tenderfoot. You hain’t ben on
the diggin’s long null to sit down on a cactus bush
and eat a cold dinner without grumblin’. Until you
kan do thet, you hain’t no business makln’ up to
Sal williams. Besides thet, ther seems to be some-
thin’ ailin’ of you. Suppos’n you try Varmifuge.
Chub Newett, as keeps the gin ral store, says as
how it’s powerful in cases sich as yourn. Yours
in a horu, Sap Wiliuams. P.S.—Next time you
come snootin’around our place, I’m goin’ fur to
sick Towse on yer.” It is needless to state that we
didn’t go “ snookin’ around ” their place any more.
But we were younger than we are now, and
not half so careless about being laughed at. So
we sold out our claim, and the next day found us
on the overland coach bound for Carson City.
But, there. We’ve gone clear off again, and
haven’t told you anything about the opera yet.
Well, there are Fanny Liddiard, Ida Osborne,
Philip Day, Edwin Kelly, W. H. Woodfield, and a
host of others, about whom we may tell you some-
thing next time. What you want to know is
whether it’s worth going to see. It is worth going
to see, and bids fair to run longer than any of the
pieces previously presented at the Royal during
the present season.

If Dion Boucioault wasn’t the son of a
Moonshiner, he ought to havo been, for a host of
his favourite characters are so thoroughly Im-
pregnated with the spirit which made Moonshin-
mg not only possible, but positively enchanting,
that one cannot help wondering from whence he
derived his subtle power of description, if not
from breeding and early experience. One of his
best characters, to our mind, is Conn the Shaugh-
raun, the hero of the play of that name now on at
the Opera House. We told you about this piece
last week, and how Jenny Lee played In the title
role. For several nights the litile actress was ill,
and Harry Leston took her place. You remember
lo’s of things that you nave seen Harry do, no
doubt, but you )1 never forget him as tne Tipsy
Passenger in the " Silver King.” Harry can play
Conn, too; but after you have seen Boucicault
himself, Grattan Riggs, and A. O. Miller in the
character, you don't care to see any other man
attempt it. But you do grow interested in Jennie
Lee’s rendition of the part, for you can’t help re-
membering all the time that she is a little woman,
and it is amusing to watch her efforts to be a man.
The first night she gave us a sort of combination
of Jo, Sam. Willoughby, and the Grasshopp“r,
wrapt in one, and made immensely funny by
the brogue and carriage the actress assumed.
We don't know why it is that Jennie Lee
plays best in male characters; but we do know
that if we were as pretty a little woman as she is,
we wouldn’t be a borrid man at any price, nor
look like one for love or fame. But tastes differ,
and the world has been standing half-bewildered
ever since that eventful morning when the .old
woman kissed her cow. The cow doesn’t seem to
understand it yet, either; but cows were not built
for philosophy, Milk is more iu their line.

George Forbes played Captain Molyneaux
very mm h after the style of George Forbes You
wouldn’t hardly beiieve it, perhaps, but we are
getting to like Mr. Forbts on the stage. This is
not because he plays so well, but because we have
a curiosity to see what he will do with each new
part assigned him. We have a suspicion that
George knows as well as anybody that he can’t act
a little b.t; but be seems to like the stage, and the
public tolerate him, probably for the same reason
that we do—it humours him and amuses them.
There is this that we must say for Mr. Forbes.
When.be has a long engagement at any theatre,
and is suddenly cast out of any new piece, we miss
him like a front tooth. The stage don’t seem right
unless he comes on sometime during the evening.
After we get used to hi n, we actually believe that
we would sit and watch him play Hamlet, rather
than not see him at all : and you can, or rather
can’t, imagine what George would do with Ham-
let. Oh, by the way, we had almost forgotten to
remind yoo that Mr. Forbes has written a new
comedy, "The Phiiantropist," which is to be played
for the first time on any stage at the Gaiety
Theatre on Saturday evening ot thi- week. And
this will bring back to us a number of old favour-
ites and friends. Wybert Reeve will re-appear, so
will Maggi Knight, Miss Bessie Palmer, and Lillie
Bryer. Yes. and there will be Harry_ Lesion,
Edwin Palmer, the redoubtable George ,hims<.ll,
and a hand-cart lull of smaller fry. We are going
to see his piece, for Lord Loltus and his lady have
nroraised to be there, and they are always scolding
because of late we don’t seem to want to app ar in
public with them. But we can assure both you
and them that we haven't intended to appear
neglectful or discourteous. Our reason all along
has been that, whenever we used to go to the same
place as the Governor, we got all the attention,
and we couldn’t bear to see his dear old face
shadowed over by a fueling of lonilness and
neglect.

We told you last week how well we liked
James Carden’s Corry Kincheli.and Oily Deering's
Harvey Duff. Well, the programme has been
changed, for 8om° reason, and Mr. Franklyn bas
assumed the role of Duff. And a genuine duffer he
is in that part, for he can’t play it any more than
our step-uncle can, and be keeps a saloon on tho
outskirtsof Hamburg. Mr. Arthur Rodney, too,
was rather a •'frost ” as Robert Fflliott. Rodney
looks like Henry Irving, and, on occasion, can
imitate him ratber cleverly, but that doesn’t make
him a finished actor by any means, as is shown by
the tact that he can't play the Fenian for sour
apples. There is too muen of the “lah-de-dah”
about him for a Fenian, and that seems to come so
natural to him that he doesn’t appear abli to
throw It off before leaving the dressing-room.
With the exception of Jennie Lee, we failed
to discover any improvement either in the cast or
the acting. Jennie has evidently been reading Thk
Bulletin between the lines of the play, and lat-
terly has been giving us a creation more like Conn
and less like Jennie Lee. We weren’t pining for a
change, you know, for Jennie is good enough for
us pro or Conn; but the interests of true art must
be concerved.

Oh, yes; and if we hadn’t met Monty
Brown, we should have forgotten to tell y< u that
“ The Shaughraun ” gives way on Saturday night
to the "School lor Scandal," which will be pre-
sented at the Opera House by the London Comedy
Company, of whom Marie de Grey is the bright
particular star, with Mrs Chippendale as principal
satelite; and the evergreen, or red, lather, Mouty
Browne as agent. Miss de Grey didn’t have very
good luck over in Adelaide; but that is owing to
the fact that our Southern sister is just beginning
to cast off her swaddling provincial clothes, and
won’t countenance anything that doesn’t first meet
the approval of c'yduey. You remember what a
“ frost ’’ Sheridan’s " Fun on the Bristol ” was down
in Melbourne ? Well, that was all because the
piece wasn't put on hero first, and we hadn’t a
chance to pass an opinion on it. You’ll see that
when the Widow O’Brien goes back to Melbourne,
she’ll get the warmest reception of anybody ex-
cept Genevieve Ward. Now, we have our repu-
tation, and what is better, perhaps, our peanuts, to
stike that our prophesy proves correct; that is, of
course, providing Sheridan takes his play to the
Bijou or the Victoria Hall. But we must getaway
from the Opera House and “ The Shaughraun ’’ for
the present, for we hear the Juveniles “ peeping"
away up at the Gaiety, and we want to see what
sort of a house they’ve got, and how they handle
"The Pirates of Penzance.”
*» * «
You have seen “The Pirates,’’ of course.
A much-quoted writer has said: “ see Venice and
die.” That may be sound advice in a beautiful
locality like Venice, but if you take our tip for it,
you’ll not want to die when you see Stanley s
Juveniles attempt “The Pirates of Penzance."
Ton'll want to live long enough to dance on the
graves of the daily critics who told you the per-
formance was worth going to see—was, in fact,
inimitable and thorougnly surprising. Of course,
it is only a very small proportion of the public to
whom we now address ourselves, for the vast
majority of play-goers have grown accustomed to
the twaddle in the dailies, and have found out that
they must either go themselves or read The
Bulletin before coming to a conclusion as to the
merits of a play. We must tell you that we don’t
like the children as pirates; but in the Panto-
mime, with whicn the performance closes, they
are quite entertaining. We liked them so well in
" Jack the Giant Killer,” that we almost made Mr.
Stanley a proposition to adopt t ein; but as we
heard he would want to be included, we gave it
up, and the Juveniles are still under his charge.
It we had them, we should go around taking con-
tracts from big warehouse firms to rid their estab-
lishments of ruts. Then we should train them up
a little further in "The Pirates” and take them
around to play the piece in the cellars. If that
didn’t kill the rats, we should be greatly disap-
pointed; but we are so flrmly convinced that It
would that we are willing to take a benefit If we
lose.

Dolly Itufaan looked pretty as the Major-
General, and Amelia Hodge was passing sweet as
Mabel. Amy Child’s Frederick was a sort of
hybrid performance that wouldn t have been
powder enough, &c., had it not been fur hei
pleasant face ana really excellent voice. But
again little Walter Harman carried away the show-
cases of the bakery. He is the cutest little scamp
we ever saw on the stage, and the first thing his
folks know we ll be making a second Charlie Ross
of him. The beauty of his acting is that he studies
out all his business himself, and is quite indepen-
dent of the stage manager or the prompter. Such
precocity was what prompted us to steal pigeons
when a boy, and to " raise ” cheques later on. By
and bye we are going to stand lor Parliament, if
we can find out in which district the weakest—beg
pardon, we mean the honeetest— man now hails
from. If you have followed us, you know that
“ The Philantropist ” is to be put on at the Gaiety
on Saturday evening of this week. So we’ll bid
good-bye to the juveniles, hoping that it may be a
long time before we have occasion to spank them
again.

Miss de Grey and company open at the
Opera House on Saturday, in toe " School for
Scandal." Kiss de Grey is an actress of the Langtry
type. The new star has a singularly picturesque
appearance. Mr. Monty Browne la her agent. He
has a singularly picturesque appearance also. So,
it will be seen from tho outset, that the show is
generally attractive. This is a spec, of Messrs.
Allison and Rignold, and the toga of glory has
fallen on Monty as their representative. And, by
the way, Monty has a pretty little daughter who
plays in the company under the name of Miss
Fanny Montague, and whom the S.A. Register
butters ad. lib. With regard to her pourtrayai
(oh, Alfred !f of Angie Gordon, it says:—"This
gushing young party was most pleasantly por-
trayed by Miss Fannie Montague, who made a
decided hit in the character, and was frequently
and not undeservedly applauded.” Pretty this,
isn’t it ? But not so pretty as Monty Brown with
a watch-chain all over his waistcoat and a nine-
inch smile.

We like to give a new organ a show; so now
for the Melbourne Era, which is also several other
things we have not time to set down; and is edited
by “Hotspur," whoever the deuce lie is. The paper
is more sporting than anything else, and in order
to show “ Hotspur’s ” infinite judgment in aquatic
matters, we give entire his boat-race tip, which
appears in the second issue : —
: Hanlan and Beach on Saturday. It's:
:all over. Put every cent you have on:
: HANLAN,
; He Can't Lose. :
After this, if “Hotspur” will kindly forward us,
in future, his selections on the principal events, we
shall be happy to give him a percentage on our
winnings! In size, the paper is big enough to
wrap up sixpenny worth of hard-bake in, but not
large enough to hold a quart of walnuts. Its
phraseology is somewhat original. For instance:
“We saw Mrs. Templotoi, Charlie, Vernon Reid.
Tyrrell, and all the crowd in town on Monday,
looking so horribly Vanderbiltish [!!!] that we
wished we were in the * push ’ to go with them
overland to Sydney.” A supplement is published
in this number, exactly the size of a restaurant
bill of fare, and contains a communication from
Sydney, sent by the immortal orator who was so
crushed at Foley’s fight. [“ You may have road it
in the Melbourne Sportsman.” Yah! Booh! Kill
him 1 Whoosh!] A sample of the Era’s dramatic
criticism is worth quoting. Here it is:—“ We will
not Individualise the performers [their italics];
suffice it to say that the only one who didn’t de-
serve hanging was the little girl with the lavender
stockings.” What, however, goes even further to
assure the success of this gorgeous publication
than the items we have quoted, is that they publish
the stalest wheezes as original matter, and on the
front page. Everybody knows the retort on Ward
Beecher when he stated that he never spoke
authoritatively of a place unless he’d been there.
Well, in trying to localise this item, the gifted
editor commences as follows:—“While talking to
a number of gentlemen at the Theatre Royal bar,
a well-known divine remarked,” &c. [!!] On the
whole, we think that th; Era is a very nice little
paper; but we consider that, before many numbers
are out, there will be a very strong flavour of
leather about the staff-shoe-leather.

artistic manner in which he used to grease the
machinery. Frank was a stalwart-looking fellow
and the best-liked of all the boys. He never
affected much style; but there’s one thing certain
—he looked fifty per cent, bettor in his canvas rig'
when down in the well of the machine, than he did
when solemnly driving to town in the frock coat
and bell-topper of civilisation. We believe Frank
will make a name yet, in the old country—pro-
bably as a diplomat. For we are sure his success
whatever it is, will not be unconnected with

“ The glories of this glittering scene,
And watch the dance’s mazy ring,
And feel I’m every inch a king,
And scrutinise each loose-hung locket,
And nimbly whip it in my pocket;
Whilst royally I twirl my stick.
And in my pouch six watches tick—
What more can man desire on earth ?
I’ll now give way to joy and mirth—
A cup of wine! Oh, for the eyes
That in King Charley’s revelries
Were wont to sparkle night and day
And turn Life’s weary tolls to nlay!”
“You’ll join me, sir ?” a stranger cried,
“ I will, though scarce my lips be dried—
A toast-the fairesi fair, Nell Gwynn.”

A bigger set of toadies than are to be
found in our legislature, could scarcely exist.
We have seen a bright young member—a
poor barrister, perhaps—speaking logically and
to the point; and all the while constantly
Interrupted by a collection of jays,’ who
ought to be chopping wood with a blunt axe;
while, let some ponderous titled ass or “influen-
tial citizen ” get up, he may meander along to any
extent he pleases; the unutterable rot he perpe-
tuates being onl / interrupted by a few fawning
and slavish “hears!” Let them say what they
like, they are all Cupids in their hearts.

WHO HE WAS.
“ You go my way ?’’ (Oh, thunder! ’twas
The most inf ernal weather I)
“ If so, good stranger, say, because
We’ll take a cab together.
Upon his face we didn’t dwell
(We’d been for a small outing;
But yet we carried very well
The dread effects of shouting).
We called a cab, and both got in—
Now mark, we are no cowatd I
But shuddered, as with a dark grin,
He said, “lama Ho ward I”
We gazed at him and then beheld
A face, to put it mildly,
That, if one rather to it held,
He would not love it— wildly.
He laughed a laugh that so lacked glee,
It was more like a sob, sir;
“I see,” said he, “ you don't know me—
Well, I am Nosey Bob, sir.”

It’s astonishing how many satisfactory ex-

We have it on record that whenever the
editor of a paper uses (D.V.) often, he is nearly
sure to be a D.V. himself.
Dan. Smith terms “flaggelator” “flog-
gerator.” We forget at what hotel he put up
when he landed. Let’s see!
The Rum has an article—“ What is Colonial
Wine?” Well, somet'rnes it's a mystery; but it
generally isn't colonial wine.
We suppose Alfred would be offended if
Her Majesty conferred upon him the Order of the
Thistle. Thlnu, and you’ll laugh.
Ikey writes, gravelv : “ Mrs. Smyrke was
Interred at the expense of this society.” What a

In cricket, there is just an “ I ” of a differ-

Now that the Quirindi people are out, it

A gentleman in Forbes recently, while

The Herald says, in a sub-leader: “You

The Morpeth Times is glad that “a little
new blood will be infused into the Council.” With
the present European outlook before us, we rejoice
at this.
We can snap our llugersjat the mention of

has just decided to shoot every year for a Silver

The Cooma Express says that many men
who have come into the country for work have

Whenever you see a woman come to throw

“You can never get head or tail out of

English v. Cooma Express was a libel

We wish the Redfekn Times would issue

It has never transpired, by the way, who
the stabber was. From the lengthened “re-
ticence” of the police, we begin to think it, must
be somebody very “ well connected ” indeed.
Justice is said to be even-handed. Under
present arrangements, in this country she is very
often left-handed. It is certain she is not light-
handed, but not so clear that c he Is not light-fin-

“The law for the rich and the law for the

Did you ever hear Alfred’s essay on the
bee? “No!” Well, here it is “T e be is biger

perceptible by this that his scholastic course was
completed.
The ArmidaTjH Chronicle says that The
Rcleetin ”is beginning to find there are some
men of wit and education out of Sydney.” Yes,
dear boy: but only a little way out. We live in
the suburbs.
It’s epidemic. Mark this wire (our italics):
—“Anna M. L. Potts, MD, is having crowded

Tomkins recently bought a yacht, which
he christened “Tne Swallow,” but after the ex-
perience of a few trips he says the name is most
inappronriate, as ths boat always makes him do

In the interview between Admiral Miot
and the Hova plenipotentiaries, the French com-

In a country newspaper office. “ Do you

The Bennett-Mackay cable between Europe
and New York was designed for the special benefit
of the N. Y. Herald. An application to have it
duplicated in the interests of the Corowa paper
is under consideration.
R. A. Proctor has written an article show-
ing that an exploration of c tves, and underground
woraings generally, points to a time when all the

It was kind of the landlord to say that he
wouldn’t press the late Mrs Smyrke for rent. If
he had put the bailiffs in! Well, if he had, he
could have only seized the occupant, and that
would probably have saved her life.
We wonder who that dull dog is who writes
the Herald’s Brisbane letter. By the way, there
is a good deal of similarity in his style to that of
the solid man who dates from Paree. This, wo
presume, is merely a coincidence.
“ The Marquis de Leuville has recently
presented his fiancee, Mrs. Leshe, with a diamond
coronet, tho central stone having been in the pos-
session of the de Lsuvilles for 400 years.” Well,
it was only her due. She “ got it out.”
She remarked at breakfast time that she

“Why,” once saida man to one of the pro-
prietors of the Maitland Mercury, “do you print
your paper in so many sneets ?” “ Well, the fact
is,” said the proprietor, shutting the immense
door of the Iron safe with a clang—“ the fact is,
they like it. It looks more."
Certain bones of the tiger species were
found at the Pish River caves, lately. The savants
say this is a clear proof that this country was once
infested by animals of this description. Well, per-
haps so; out there was certainly a tiger lost from
a circus not far from there once.
A girl in England drowned, herself lately
because her young man, Charley, loved her no
more. Tbe jury returned a verdict of suicide
while in a state of unsound mind. Rather! The
girl who would drown herself for a person called
Charley must have been very mad indeed.
A military man laughed at a timid little
woman because she was alarmed at the noise of
the cannon whan a salute was being fired. He
subsequently married that timid little woman, and
six months afterwards he alwa\s took off his boots
in the hall when he came home late at night.
We understand that, at the next general
election, Mr. Copeiand will make his few electoral
“remarks” at Armidale. Funny thing at Arrai-

Scene: Bal'-rootn. Swell, to pretty widow
(having broached com try-house visit': “Do you

So much has been said now about Civil
Service embezzles gelling off easy because they
; were “ well-connected,” that they say the latest
one is not to be prosecuted chiefly because he Is
confoundedly ill-connected. As the Honorable
; Mr. Lucas would say, there are compensations in
| everything.
He was a well-known German, and on a
hard puller without a curb he was affording excel-
lent amusement to his friends. A friend rode up
and called out, “I say, Fallenoffenheim, what are
you doing to-night?” “Don’t speak to me!” ex-
claimed the troubled Teuton; “don’t you see I am
busy riding?”
Some amiable lunatics are "going about,
we believe, making an effort to resuscitate Sydney
Punch. In conjunction with this intelligence, it
is a somewhat significant fact that the Hon. F. M.
Q C , has just requested and obtained six
months' leave of absence from tne senate of the
Sydney University.
Kea.’ly all the houses in the little 12s. a-
week 1 erraces have pianos now; and, what is worse,
nearly all the young ladies ot the families have a
taste for simring. A favourite lyric with them, we
notice, is “Fill the gobling— let it spiarkle;” while
the fathers and brothers very much affect “ The
brave old hoak.”
When David Belasco (his name is probably
Johnson) was called before the curtain after the
first act of h s play “ May Blossom,” at the Madi-
son Square Theatre, he fainted. It has since trans-
pired that the whole thing was adapted from the
French, and another man adapted it. No wonder
ha fainted. His little conscience!
“ Some Hebrew manuscript about 700 years
old has been presented to ihe Sydney University.”
One of our most valued contributors doubts the
genuineness of the MSS., and offers to produce
recent MSS. written by a Hebrew, concerning
which there can be no dispute. His terms for
entering into ttie controversy are—ball.
Henniker and an Irish member were look-
ing on when the head of the Duke of Wellington’s
statue was unscrewed. “ Why it’s hollow ! ” said
the former, in a tone of surprise. “Yes," re-
marked his companion, and then—smiling blandly
on H«nniker —added wickedly, “ Nature often
works in the same way as the bronze-caster.”
Irish humour is still alive. A gentleman
who, in the exercise of his rent-requiring func-
tions, encountered circumstances which destroyed
one of h;s eyes, blew off part of his face, and irre-
movably deposited a bulletin his skull, isdescribed
as having been “ unpopular with his tenants.”
Both he and his wife were found dead in bed.
Thus Alfred on the result of the Beach-
Hanlan boat race:—“ The gratifying result was
made known at the Evening News office fully
half an hour before the news was received by any
other person in town. Crowds of people thronged
the International Hotel, ami flatlg denied the truth
of the message; but as the time wore on, other
messages were received, and the colours of Beach
were hoisted at tho International, cheer after cheer
rang forth from the excited crowd for the Austra-
lian,” etc. 1 he italics are ours. The excited crowd
had seen the Nooze before, therefore comment is
needless. But why this public admission, Alt'.?
“ What you want is the nationalisation of
your land,” said a bar-room orator to a crowd of
farmers. “How's the manure sold?” asked the
oldest man in the room, inviting the speaker to a
drink. Wiping the foam from his lips, the old
dodger said, “ Ah, that’s it. That’s what I want to
know. But the paper I seen it in said it was the
best top-dressing ever found out.”
“ If there is one characteristic of the age
that is more conspicuous than another as exhibit-
ing the essentially vicious drift of our modern
civilization.it is the rare for wealth,” observed a
hungry Domainer, as he refused a shilling to go a
half-mile message, and strolled around for the
first haul of orango-pcel and sandwich-crusts in
the park.
A home paper says it appears from statis-
tics that “life on board shin is a kind ot training
ground for officers, on leaving the navy, to become
clergymen.” The reason is very obvious. The
naval officer finds that, great as is the favour with
which he is regarded by the fair sex, the curate is
even more popular. Therefore, he becomes a
curate.
“ What is the use of all this shameful sacri-
fice ot human life in this bloody butchering of
Arabs and Egyptians ?” demanded a Market Wharf
politician, as ne mingled water with his whisky on
Friday last. “Damiflno,” reolied a disconsolate-
looking duffer near him; "it don’t seem to raise
th’ price o’ pigs a bit, so far ez 1 kin see—now,
does it ?”
“ So you say you can write for anything,”
mused an editor to a beery applicant for a re-
portership, who waa awaiting a reply while the
critical gaze ran down his copy. “I can.” was the
confident reply. “Then t'llgiveyou a show,” said
tho editor, pointing to the basket and pitching in
the agonising screed; “send in plenty ot copy—
for that.”
Herald: “ E.Y. — You doubt me, though
dearer than life to me.” Of course, she does, since
she saw you with the other girl. Come, hurry up,
E.Y., and let us know (not necessarily lor publica-
tion) which is really dearer than life to you-the
young tobacco-twistress with the red shawl, or the
svlph with the carbuncle ponum who does the
milk-walk ?
“ A party of four young (sic) were sup-
posed to have been lest (sic) .in the bush in the
northern part of the colony of South Australia,
have been found, all well, by a large search
party.” From Alfred, of course! This is one
result of all the staff going to the boat race, and
leaving the managing editor to do all the fine
raiding himself.
A storekeeper living in a place called Slap-
up, advertises in the Monaro Mercury that he
wishes to call In all his outstanding- debts. We
should think so I The lyre I—

The Salvationists finding, when applied to
for “tucker” by those in want, that the “ Lord
will provide " is pretty well played out, have now
another elegantly holy gag. Le void “ The Onlv
Shelter: Christ] is the omy shelter of the soul ih
trouble.” This would almost convert a houseless
hungry man on a wet night —we mean, convert him
from his transient belief in the Harmy, and send
him out collecting lumpsof road-metal.
“ The number of female physicians at pre-
sent practising in Russia amounts to 350, ot whom
there are no fewer than 100 in St. Petersburg it

The Continong is pretty smart.
Oh, that, indeed, must bo conceded;

Of “ dropping down" so'lom e ewe did,
A rather obscure member of the Legisla-
ture, much be-saituonad, knocked in the a earlv
hours of the morning at the door of th Woolloo-

Thorshi lived here.” “So you do,” Slid the set"
geant. And so he did, until next morning. “The
case was heard in the magistrate’s private room ”

The disaffection amongst the Melbourne
warriors seems to be due to the fact that many
have not got their uniforms, and have to
make their daily onslaughts on the canteen in
moleskin pants and dungaree jumpers. They all
wish to be led into the deadly breaches—the deadly
regimental breaches. (Registered.) [We cannot
really see anything either serious or arguments
live in this.—Ed. B.]
There’s a picture in this week’s Tamworth
News, and u one seems to know exactly what it
purposes to represent; whether it’s Josephs’
country house, me Escurial at Madrid, a new d«

Villa Nevada, or a wholesale boot-manutaetorv
We wish Jos< phs would elucidate. Tnis mystery

So one of the ancient Parramatta River
wheezers went on the rocks, and another Parra-
matta wheezer came to the rescue, with the fol-
lowing brilliant effect:—“She was badly steered,
also, the result being that she ran into the Osprey,
knocking that steamer higher up on the roots and
going ashore herself.” The Parramatta wheezers
have no boats: so here seems a very good show for
a frtsh-water Grace Darling.

Granny’s mission, just at present, seems
to be disingenuous reflection upon the conduct of
the French whoso republican proclivities she can’t
abear. The Foochow bombardment, she tells us
(with complacent ignoring of what occurred at
Alexandria), was a violation of the usages of
civilized warfare, and yet we haven’t heard that
Courbet offered a reward for the head of the
Chinky generalissimo.
We have just learned, by telegraph, that
Ballington Booth of the Harmy and Captain
’Oward are coming to Sydney next week. One
plays the violin and the other the concertina.
These musicians, with Happy George on the drum,
the Converted Fireman on the cornet, and Hallelu-
jah Bob on the bassoon should form an attractive
quintette. We should say they would be a great
success—at the cat-scaring business.
A Barnsley cottier, aged 21, whe had quar-
relled with his sweetheart, drowned himself and

I commit myself to a watery grave. ”
In Sydney, it is generally the poor devil’s relatives

A Bundaberg ethnologist has discovered
that the Scotch and the Jews were once Identical.
This is a pleasing testimony to our cleverness.
Over two years ago we wrote, apropos of some-
thing we can't remember now—“To the saying,
‘Scraich a Russian and you’H find a Tartar,’
might be added another—* Scratch a Scotchman
and you’ll find a Jew.’ ” The Scotch frequently
find themselves Jews; it is their national failing.

On the first night of his arrival at a Cara-

One of the Herald boat-race men has the
following:—“ He [Hanlan] seemed very fit, and
showed, in all his actions, whilst waiting fora start
that he was prepared to row a great race.” This
is the recognised “aquatic copy.” Any innova-
tion upon this would.probably bring the writer
into exceeding unpopularity with rowing men; an
event, we suppose, that would break any hearts
but ours. For our parts, we are aweary of these
eel-punchers ”
They wouldn’t let a bushman into a house
not long ago, at Brunswick (Vic.), and so he came
back after a bit and just fired the place. When
arrested, he said it was bis playful little way of
triving a lesson in hospitality. This action is much
admired among swagmen, who appreciate its noble
motive. The pri oner is probably, judging fiom
tbe refined ferocity of the act, of Oriental descent.
But we really cannot say. All we know is that his
name is Maloney.
After the carving lodger had backed the
knife into a saw over the leg of a fowl which had
travelled so well in the days of his flesh that he
had none left, he sat down perspiring. Then the
bird rose from the dish, and from his headless
trunk came the ghostly words: “ Who’s that rub-
bing a candle on my leg ? I can’t see very well
without my head. Why can’t you let me rest after
I’m dead ? Can’t you start on the stuffing ? It’s
inside, somewhere.”
We read that in Algiers, fearing the recur-
rence of hostilities such as happened during the
recent anti-Semetlc riots, the Jews keep their
houses shut, and have no intercouse with the outer
world. This is lucky for such Algerians as have
bills of sale on their furniture; but it’s very rough
on any artless “sports” who have backed tne
wrong horse, and haven’t the needful wherewith
to meet the Algerian Ned Jones at the local Tat-
tersall’s on settling day.
What is sacred music? “Desist,” ex-
claimed an indignant mother to her son, when one
Sunday afternoon she heard issuing from the
drawing-room piano sounds incompatible with
her Sabbatarian ideas. “ But, mamma, dear,” an-
swered the son, “the piece is called ‘The March
of the Jewish Priests.’ ’* “ Oh! very well,” replied
the mater; “ If it is anythin? to do with priests it
must be sacred, so pray continue.” We consider
this a most delicious story.
Apropos of the unpleasant condition of
the bath and other accommodation of the hotel

pondent asks:—
“ Where and oh where is our little—See move—

With his work out short, and his screw cut Ion?,
Whore and oh where can he be ?”
Curiously enough, we met Mr. Seymour outside

mansion; and, chuckling softly, says: *‘It takes
me to do it.” By the way, in the next Ministry,
there is not the slightest doubt that R. B. will be
Minister for Justice. We’ve seen somebody’ like
Mr. Smith somewhere, and we can’t make out who
it could be. Apollo, most likely.
They loved one another dearly, and they
were out walking in the dewy eve. “The doctor
came to-day, Edwin, dear,” said she, mildly. He
dropped her arm as though it had been red-hot,
his leatures turned ashy pale, the perspiration
stood in beads upon his forehead, and staggering
back he hoarsely gurgled—“ Which doctor.” She
whispered the name. “ Oh, if that s the case,” he
replied, “of course, I—” And they continued
their walk, in the dewy eve.
R. B. Smith, Esq., M.P. for the Hastings,
has bought a new mirror. It is 20ft. x 18ft. We
saw twenty men hoisting it into his gilded man-
sion last Saturday. Peeping in, we saw the under-
butler dusting the armour of Cupid's ancestors in
the halt. We tapped her on the shoulder, and said,
“ What does your master want that enormous pier
glass for, Jane?” She looked round surprised.
“To shave with,” she said; “t'other one worn’t
large enough, so it has been put in the libery.”
Alfred has endowed the Newsboys’ Bri-
gade with a flfe-and-drum band. This will come
in handy for the evening parties, and will save the
expense of the cornet and violin —not to mention
the wear-and-tear of the Erard. We understand
that it was only when he heard of the flfe-and-
drum business that Chris, banded in his little mite.
Talking of Cnris, we •■aw a portrait of him, the
other uay, at the photographer’s. He looked all
gloves. But, perhaps, he’ll grow into them in
time.
A widow of 84 committed suicide at Vienna
a short time ago. She evidently thought ihere
was no use in waiting any longer for a husband.
You wouldn't find a Sydney widow guilty of such
foolishness. When she finds herself growing too
■old to allure by her personal attractions, she starts
a boarding-house for bank-clerks. The conse-
quence la that In course of time one of them owes
her for three months’ board, and she takes his hand
in payment. A much better plan, this, than suicide
—for the bank-clerk.
“Tickets,” cried the guard, to two beetle-
browed young candidates for the gallows, who
were perched on the tram; “tickets, now.” “I'm
’Anlan,” said the first; “I travels free.” “And
t’m Halcock, his fields admits,” says the other; “ I
travels free, too.” The guard was very busy then,
so he passed on. By and bye, he returned. “So
you’re Hanlan and Alcock, are you ?” “We bar.”
“ Well, then,” said the guard, deliberately, “ 1 m
going to kick Hanlan, and to lock Alcock up.”
They found a sixpence.
“A morning with the Rothschilds ” is the
heading of an article that runs through many ot
the country papers. It is generally put in the
funny column, and is evidently the handicraft of
a man who had to sit down on a candle-box and
write for breakfast on the fly-leaf of the Family
Bible that he was afraid to “pop.” If, howev< r,
he actually did interview the old millionaire, as he
says, he ought in all honesty to give us “ An Even-
ing outside the Kothscbilds,” and some idea of
how their boots are toed.
The Redfern Bancroft intimates that
Lord Noru anby has tee . r c ived vlth “oien

to the resident housekeeper. This reminds us i ha.
Lady Normanby was cordially hated by the Vic-
torian ladles who frequented Government House.
Ic is reported that after her first reception in
Queensland, she detained one oi the lady visitors,

O’Mulligan, do you all come from Botany Bay ?”
Here’s the flowing bowl slopping all over
the floor again. Speaking of the recent Land Bill
shivoo, the South Australian "Tizer says: “At a
quarter past 1 the Speaker left the chair for re-
freshment. When the House resumed, the Speaker
was unable to take the chair.” For length, breadth,
depth, and general massiveness of construction,
that’s about the most successful libel we have ever
struck since the sultry day that Mrs, Potlphar went
for the innocent, unsuspecting Mr. Joseph. Sir
Toby has the ’Tizer clean over the Supreme Court
“ pocket ” this time.
A corpse was in one compartment of the
train from Maryborough to Ballarat, and a newly-
wedded couple in the next, whereupon the News
has this profound comment: “Thus the brightest
and darkest pages of life were brought closely
together.” We pass over the bold and dashing
metaphor which makes death a page of life, be-
cause it’s the News’ own monopoly to attach no
meaning to anything, and to call a horse a hash-
spoon if it comes more readily to the tongue
(which it does, by the way), but what we want to
know is what that young couple have done to be
reminded that the dead man next door has the best
of it ? Won't they find it out in good time ? Oh,
cruel!
It is rough on the journalist, who has no
real memory for the incidents he encounters, and
bo constructs one by the aid of an expensive note-
book with a morocco cover and solid silver bind-
ing, to find towards the end of the week, when
printers are clamouring for "copy,” that the only
information which that magnificent volume will
disgorge consists of fifteen feminine addresses,
tbe record of some utterly unpayable bets, and a
cabman’s number in nine figures, with a struggling
statement underneath: “email summons him for
refusing more than his fare.”
Dr. Ducrot, of Maitland, must be such a
funny man. He publishes a Proclamation in the
Maitland Mail. Here is a little of it: “ Whereas
information has been communicated to me this
(Thursday) morning, August 7th, a.d. 1884, that
the Society of Guilds have proposed the name of
the said Louis Ducrot, M.D., as medical officer for
their Lodge, the said Louis Ducrot, Doctor of
Medicine, does hereby solemnly declare that no
Society in Maitland could drink Ms medicine,
because they are not able to pay for it.” This
refers to the Druids. What the Druids will have
to say about the matter will appear in another
chapter.
They want a clergyman at Norfolk Island,
and a Mr. Mills writes to the Times that it would
oe “ a charming retreat for some clergyman.”
Tuere is no rush for the billet. We regularly read
ttie s. M. Herald’s Norfolk Island letter, and have
yearned to get to that land of excitement. Here is
a specimen of the giddy whirlJanuary : A
schooner appeared off the coast; name unknown.
February: Tbe whaler osprey watered and left.
March: A leading resident is suffering from a sur-
feit of oysters. April; No mails since 1847. Is the
French Revolution commencing ? At ali events,
we are safe down here. Is it true that gold has
been uiscovered in Australia ?”
That “ Yorkshireman ” in the Sportsman,
or somethihg, ia a wonderful prophet. Here’s his
tip for the boat-race:—“ Should Banian, therefore,
be ‘ the least bit off,’ the Championship of- the
World might be in danger.”—
We’re lost in admiration quite!
That's the way to get along,
Because you know, if you're not right,
You cannot possibly be wrong.
This feat is truly grand and great!
Can you, will you, dare you say

Our speckled hen is going to lay ?
Here’s a bit of jam from the agony column
of Tuesday’s Morning Muffin:— “ Bright and
pretty, admired, reproachful thoughts, Inatten-
five, fearing blame; recognised too late, dearie;
have spoken ; comprenez ? Longed-for oppor-
tunity thwarted; no sunshine yet; disappointed;
fate inexorable. M.” This is a “cypher” ad.,
and having worried out the key, we find the plain
English of it read :—“Ceme home, you dirty,
drunken, loafer, Gilhooley, and work lor your
starving wife and children. The police are on your
track. Baby’s got the chicken-pox, and Matilda
Ann’s gone to ive with the nigger cook at the
boiling-down establishment. Come home, you
wretch, come home.” That “ busts ’’ the “ bright
and pretty ” business all to pieces.
The wife of a selector named Paul sum-

It would be interesting to know what
course would be open to Stephen Murphy suppos-
ing his ease were a good one, and that he obtained,
as he alleges he did, a verdict against the
M.U..I.O O.F. The Chief Justice tells him that
the Supremo Court has no jurisdiction, even if the
case he a good one— but that statement probably
only means that Murphy mustn't expect the Court

Why don’t these enormously rich people
here set the example to the close-fisted aristocracy
of England, and give a few hundreds each to the
poor I But what’s the good of talking ? We once
gave regularly to the poor for three years. Every
morning, on our way to the office, we used to give
3d. to a blind beggar. One afternoon, however,
meeting him, we said, airily, “ Ezekiel, would you
like an order for the play ?” “ Yes, and thank you,
good master,” replied he, quietly. Then a dark
and bloody suspicion came over us, and we stopped
his allowance. Just—as we are informed—as he was
going to set up his carriage.
Granny’s Melbourne correspondent sneers
at the memory of Wilson Gray, who, he says, was
a confessed failure as a politician, “so he went to
New Zealand, got made a sort of a Judge, and there
gave up the ghost.” If the value of political effort
may be judged by its seminal effects, Gray was
not a failure as a politician, though he missed
clutching the golden keys and shaping the whis-
pers of Victoria's Vico-regal throne. The sort of a
Judge he made was such that his memory is re-
verenced in New Zealand as that of a conscientious
and just magistrate—so truly reverenced as not to

A man in Kempsey, recently while work-
ing a tank for his master fell into it. It was near
the end of tho week, and, being a full-bodied man
he Imparted quite a flavour to the supply. The
owner was formerly very particular about this
tank* but now he has generously placed it at the
disposal of the tovfm. The town have declined to
deprive the tank-owner, and this fact deserves to
be chronicled as the first instance of anyone ih
Kempsey refusing anything. The enemies of the
tank-man say, however: that his offer was only a
blind to beguile the people into emptying a tank
of water possessing an aromatic aroma of
moleskin. Doubtless if “Cupid” were applied
to, even though he is in the Opposition—for who
could resist his blandishments ?—the Government
hydraulic pump would be sent up to aid the noble,
free, independent and conscientious elector-

It is really astonishing how apparent trilles
disconcert some people's arrangements. There is
little Golightly Smith thoroughly knocked over by
a pink bonnet. We believe it was pink, but we
won’t swear to it; we saw it, but we can’t describe
it. If we were to say it was made of flowers, it
would not be altogether right; if we were to con-
sider its construction due to the presence of lace,
we should be equally wrong; if wo ventured on
the ribbon theory, we should he bowled out to a
dead certainty ; in fact, anything like a conjecture
as to its composition would be utterly futile. It
was a delicate, delightful, downright duck of a
bonnet fashioned in fairy-land, and made up of
etherial nothings nto a beautitul something, for
the purpose of adorning a pre ty face, and up-
setting little Smith's equilibrium. Hut Smith says,
“ Bonnets wear out, and he’ll soon have to get
another one to keep thing.- sweet.” Well, he has
only one thing to do—go to Anthony Hordern and
Sons, the Palace Emporium, Haymarket.*

SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
Matterson, on Friday last, was boated by
J. Dodd, of North Shore.
At latest, F. Archer had this season won
133 races out of 373 mounts.
“ Black Charley ” Reynolds holds the
“best on record” for the Parramatta Champion
Course—30min. 8sec.
Peter Newton intends “doing” Tasmania,
New Zealand, and then ’Frisco. At the latter place
he will probably be “ done.”
Is it Beach, or his backers, who are so
anxious for a six months’ spell? From the little
we have seen of the champion, we fancy he will
find six months rather too much of a good thing.
The Wanderers’ Bicycle Club had a road
race from Petersham to Parramatta on Saturday
last. Pearson won in 56min., Dodds finished se-
cond, and Gill third, A pleasant day was wound
up by Mr. Hill fairly inundating the club men with
Krug.
In the football field on Saturday last,
University defeated Balmain by 19 points to 3;
N wtown defeated St. Leonards by 9 points to 6;
and at Bathurst a weak Redforn team suffered
defeat at the hands of the locals to the tune of 18
points tc 5.
The victory of the Australians over the
Gentlemen of England at thefOval in the second
match, was, says an English paper, due to the un-
seasonable prevalence of Midwinter, just when
the bowling of the English team ought to have
been most summary.
The last time the Prince of Wales shot at
Huntingham, he missed ten pigeons running,
though he was allowed the use of two barrels.
Perhaps the bad marksmanship of Albert Edward
accounts for a little of the Princess's anxiety to
put down pigeon-shooting.
The Bur wood-University football squabble
still remains in abeyance, and we understand the
matter has been placed before the Union, The
dispute will have to be decided sooner or later,
and we cannot see the utility of allowing it to
remain over for any length of time.
The Herald man who did the boat-race
talked of Beach balancing his boat in line style
“ through the gauntlet of water, wind, and Tomki; ”
also, of the " magnificent hydratmos ” of the
south wind. Surely, this was the result of running
the gauntlet of too many whiskies, with too little
of the hydratmos of the pump.
Hastings was kept very quiet for the
Hawkesbury Handicap, and the stable made no
end of a pot over his—except to the lucky few-
unexpected win. Young Kelso had anything but
a gay time of it, as he lost a stirrup Rather during
the running, which accident no doubt accounted
for his running across Bonnie Bee at the distance.
Notwithstanding the number of first-class
boat-builders on fihe shores of Port Jackson, it
seems a peculiar thing that one of our suburban
rowing clubs should think of sending to Mel-
bourne for a four-oared outrigger. Possibly, if
Donnelly and Sullivan, Dodd, and Messenger were
to put their heads together, they might raise a
boat approaching the standard required by the
suburbans.
On 6th July Charley Cheese and Redmond
Condon met within twenty miles or Cambridge, to
contest in a prize-fight for a purse of £50. They
stood up at ten o'clock, and after nine-two rounds,
lasting two hours and twenty-five minutes, the
affair ended in a draw. Condon was terribly
punished about the head, and was quite blind
towards the finish, whilst Cheese’s hands were com-
pletely gone.
A prominent and popular footballer again
broke his collar-bone on Saturday last. The little
misunderstanding between a couple of seamen
last week, when one left the field of battle minus a
thumb, was a mere flea-bite compared to the
roughness of the play. One up-tbe-line player,
who has been in a chronic state of skinned nose
since the season commenced, once again managed
to peel his nasal organ.
Pretty cool, the TiMES’’suggestion “ that
Hanlan, Beach, Wallace Ross, and Teemer should
row in a match on the Thames in the autumn.”
Not for Joseph! oh, dear no! Races of this de-
scription will be confined to the Parramatta for
the future. We might send the Clarence River
voungster home, if they want to see something a
trifle above their own calibre. Shade of Chambers
and Renforth, how have the mighty fallen!
The N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union rajes £to be
held next Saturday, will, no doubt, proven very
enjoyable afternoon’s sport. But are they not
making a big mistake in holding frequent race
meetings of this description? The English Union
confines Itself to races for amateur championships,
and we think the New South Wales body would do
well to follow in its wake. The Onion races
should be few and far between, and the endeavour
should be to make them the meets of the bicycling
season.
The Bur wood-Wallaroo match on Satur-
day proved a hard-fought affair, and it was un-
doubtedly the match of the season so far as the
onlookers were concerned. Burwood won by a try
to nil, Petit making the only score of the day. By
the way, a prominent University man, among the
spectators, was loud m his opinion as to the fair-
ness of the touchdown. Under the circumstances,
he would have shown better taste had he kept his
opinion to himself.
Sid. Edwards steered his brother from the
bo w of the Leveret, arme * with a red flag and a
fog horn, and Hanlan’s fright from the Tomki
must have been as nothing beside the shock given
to Matterson when the unexpected first blast from
Bid. burst upon him. However, the instrument
was not required for a lengthy period. After the
first mile, the race was a fog-horn conclusion in
favour of the Clarence River man. [Very obscure
—requires explaining,— Eu. B.|
From England we learn that the 50-miles
professional bicycle championship, run for at
Aylestone-road Ground, was won by F. Wood, who
covered the distance 3 h. 47 min. 3l)tec., and made
a “best on record.” From 35 miles the record-
beating commenced, the following being the
leaders and times for each five miles:—25 rams,
Wood, Ih. 17 min. 25sec.; 30 miles, Lees, Ih. 33 min.
30sec.; 33 miles, Lees, 1 h. 50mln. 4Jseo.; 40 miles,
Battensby, 3h. lOmin. 14sec.; 45 miles. Battensby,
3 h.38 min. 58sec.; 50miles, \V oo4, 3h.47min. 30sec.
Friday last concluded the most successful
meeting of the Victorian Coursing Club. For the
Victoria Plate, Mr. W. B. Rounsevell’s Red Hind
beat Mr. G. Whittinghara’s Whilda (late Hazel) in
the deciding course. Mr. J. Wagner’s Rhodanthe
beat Mr. W. M'Culloch’s Moss Rose, and carried off
the Vice-president’s Plate; the Sunbury Stakes
fell to Mr. G. Whittingham’s Wild Teddy, which
beat Mr. J. B. Scott’s Scissors in the decider; and
Mr. W. M'Cultoch's Mistaken beat Mr. T. Daley’s
Moonee Valley King (late Esau) for the Consola-
tion Stakes.
A foal six weeks old, in mere frolic, in the
presence of three witnesses, jumped over a close-
cut thorn hedge 5ft. lOin. in height and 3ft. wide at
top, with up-hill take off, and a ditch on landing
side (base measurement, 13ft. 3in,). The feat was
done apparently with perfect ea;e aswellassafety,
and took place at Tredington, Gloucestershire.
Martin Loughlin, who is in England, should keep
his eye on this foal, which, when a three-year-old,
will, no doubt, bo able to take Tommy Corrigan
over an eleven-foot fence stuck on top of Govern-
ment House railings.
At the International meeting in England
between the Manhattan Athletic Club, U.S., and
the South London Harriers, in the 100 yards, J. M.
Cowie, of the 8.L.H., defeated the Yankee repre-
sentative in 101-8 sec., making the beat time ever
credited to an English amateur. The Yankee flyer
Myers, about whose status as an amateur such a
dust has lately been raised, ran away with the
quarter-mile in 49 3-5sec; W. Snook defeated the
Yankee representative in the 1330 yards, in 3 min.
101-5 sec.; and in the mile he was again successful,
covering the distance in 4 min. 27 sec. L. E. Meyers
won the half-mile in 1 min. 55 3-5 sec.
The rival champions had travelled over
the first mile, and Hanlan was preparing to play
the cat-and-mouse game with the Dapto terror,
when a long-legged slab-sided party from the
States squirted a pint of tin-tag essence over the
boots of the man in front and observed: “Waal,
boys, I guass Mistur Haanlan’s goin’t’ call up t’
thet thare little pub. on th’ hill an’ hev a taste o’
doxology juice, an’ then he’ll come down an’ wait
along stream fur Mistur Bavch.” Mistur Hanlan
didn’t have to wait long. And, talking of this,
reminds us that a well-known city medico was
universally credited with having netted from £3000
to £9000 on Beach. He regrets to say, however,
that be didn’t have 9d. on the event, and that he
receives a gross of begging letters every morning
on the strength of the rumour.
Some time since, in commenting on the
fact that, in reporting the recent amateur cham-
pionship athletic meeting in England, the news-
paper men had quoted the betting on the principal
events, we stated that our amateur meetings had
not quite come to that pass just yet. However,
we find that the evil is not really so far off as we
thought. Books are now made on the principal
bicycling events, and the odds are posted daily at
a certain shop in town. This is a matter the Union
should put their number tens down on with a
vengeance. Where heavy betting steps in, it is
pretty sui’e fraud will accompany it, and honour
and fair play will take their departure.
There were a tremendous number of drags
at the Oxford-Cambridge cricket match, but the
majority of them were, to quote the words of a
swell with much collar, “ in the occupation of
shoddy people who went there to swagger.” The
lessees of these imposing conveyances provided
luncheon on a very large scale, and their servants
were kept going all the afternoon in supplying the
claret cup. As a guide to friends, the names of
the people were written on large placards that
were suspended from the roofs of the coaches.
And this served to advertise the people referred to
as persons of fashion. It is a brave thing to sit in
a public place on the top of a coach which is
labelled with one’s name. Especially if one drinks
champagne from silver mugs.
Poor old Granny continues to send the
religious reporter up to do the boat races, and, as
a natural consequence, her accounts of them still
appear a little mixed. She gave the time of the
Hanlan-Beach race just a minute too slow; but
sue outdid this trifling error when she gave the
first mile in the Matterson-Edwards affair as 7mln.
45sec., notwithstanding that thei men shot Blax-
land s in 6min. 35sec. “The buoyant carriage of
the Clarence iRiver sculler gave evidence of an
overflowing energy” is not bad, and a very
pleasant departure from the stereotyped style of
aquatic reporters, but we don’t exactly see it. The
Noozk evidently copied their report from the
“tea on the tables at six” account, as they dropped
into the same error with regard to the time taken
for the mile.
The Glebe Rowing Club had a little excite-
ment on in Blood and Entrails Bay on Saturday
last, when Messrs. Drew and Smith rowed a skiff
race from Young’s Wharf to the Club shed, for a
new hat and the iove of the thing. The race arose
out of a recent row-off to see which of the two
sucking Hanlans—we begjpardon, Beaches—should
represent the Club at the recent M.K.C. regatta,
wuich uveal w. s rowed off in rather an unsitisluu-
tory manner, after dark. On Saturday last, Smith
soon drew out a lead, and in rather a risky man-
ner took Drew's water, leading his man by a
length nearing Glebe Point Wharf. A heavy sniff
from the abbattoirs appeared to give Drew fresh
life, and he almost picked his opponent up; but
when the spurt died out. Smith increased his lead
and made an easy victory over Drew, who ap-
peared short of condition.
The rowing fever has caught even Larry
Foley, our champion middleweight—or heavy-
weight either, coming to that—who has purchased
the wager-boat built by Donnelly and Sullivan
for Hanlan. Beyond removing Hanlan’s trotter
cases and substituting a pair of number nineteen?,
the work will suit the versatile Larry to a T, and
from this out we do not suppose he will be quite so
fond of cracking a skull. A la the ex-champion,
the gentleman who so deftly put Abe Hicken in
his little cot intends shortly to give an exhibition
of his prowess in his new purchase, after which he
intends to fly at some big game—maybe a shark.
Larry is only waiting to have a little more swim-
ming practice, and then he Intends to give the
proposed exhibition. Larry’s first performance
will be going in one side of the shell and out of
the ether, a trick he claims even Hanlan has not
performed in public.
To-morrow week will be rowed the Inter-
colonial Amateur Outrigger race between W. G.
Brett of New South Wales, and A. F. Sharland of
Tasmania, for a valuable trophy in the shape of—
but, we’ll fill this in after we get a look at the pot.
Both men were out on Friday last, and after taking
a good deal in hand, rowed down with Matterson
and Edwards. Brett rowed in his old taking style,
getting along seemingly without any exertion, in
great contrast to the Yandemonian, who puts his
back into his work with a will, and effects the
Hanlan dash at the finish of the stroke. Brett
comes from the Hanlan stable, and Sharland from
the Beach ditto, which means roast turkey and fizz
v. plain victuals and a pint of stringy now and then.
The Beach stable has carried off the double so far,
but, fit and well, we expect Brett to spoil the treble
by defeating Sharland from end to end. By the
way, we heard a well-known aquatic man took
£5000 to £500 and backed the treble—Beach, Matter-
son and Brett. Mr. Brett should feel flattered at
the interest the backer of the treble now takes in
his welfare.
On the first day of the Hawkesbury August
meet. Dr. Cortis’ Despatch carried off the Hurdle
Race; Paul cantered in for the Public Auction
Stakes; Bartro made an easy win of the Guineas,
his stable companion, lolanthe, a length away,
second, and Lord Exeter, another length away,
third; Rapid defeated Princess of Lome for the
County Purse; and the Maiden Plate saw Tremando
to the fore, Cairngorm, half a length away, second,
and Prince Imperial third. The second. Handicap
Day, brought together a big crowd. The Hawkes-
bury Produce Stakes fell a victory to Reginald,
half a length from lolanthe, Cairngorm third; for
the Hawkesbury Grand Handicap, Blazes, Bonnie
Bee, Privateer, and Hastings were all in a lump at
the distance, Bonnie Bee was the first to show
with an advantage, but Hastings, with Kelso up,
came with a grand rush, and defeated Bonnie Bee
by a length in 3 min. 36%sec , Blazes, half a length
away, third. The Two-year-old Stakes fell to Cairo,
Evie second, Eagle Grange third; Nepicailina de-
feated Tempo by a neck for the Members’ Handi-
cap; Howlong made an easy win of the Disposal
Stakes : and Boscawen defeated Merlin for the
Ladies Bracelet, Tramp third.
He sat, a lonely man, in the corner of a
smoking carriage last Monday week. Generally
he loved the lively sally, the cheery greeting, and
the newsy gossip of the day; but this time there
was something the mailer with him, and his sole
amusement was a cough. “ Good morning, sir,”
to the first man who came in; “I believe that th«
constitution of the world ” “ Hold on a
minute, sir,” was the frenzied reply; “do you
believe it was rowed on its merits? ” “I was just
reflecting,” he said to the next smoker, “ on the
fleeting nature of time.” “ Time,” he said; “ why,
aren’t you satisfied with 30.28 ? ” Wearily turning
to an aged man, he said, “ Should this Federation
” " Don't tell me, sir,” was hastily jerked out;
“I believe it’s a money-making swindle! Hanlan
could never—” “ Hi, Sam, my old cock,” roared
three clerks who tumbled in at Newtown, " what
do you think now? Hand over, sonny; 30 381s the
little trick.” Then turning to a solemn grocer,
whose grizzled brow showed long and arduous
vigils over an erratic sugar market, he desperately
risked a joke at the trade. He said, “ What are
your views as to the result of the match?” and
the aged one, with a twinkle of the eye, said. “It's
natural enough. The beach has done a good turn
to the sugar, and now the ‘sugar’ goes to the
Beach.” We were about to emulate Herr
Schunke’s feat, and leap from the train, when the
ticket-collector entered the car, and looking
round with a dazed eye, called, “Beach —no,
hang it; tickets, please.”
Put a girdle round about the earth in
forty minutes, Mr. Shakespeare? Well, we should
whisper in an undertone and sing mighty small
indeed if that was all we could do in this enlight-
ened age. Now, for instance, we had a bit of a
boat race over here on the 16th, and, on the 18th,
the Melbourne Age comes along with the follow-
ing “ wire ”: “ London, 16th August.—The news of
thw defeat of Hanlan, the Canadian sculler, bv
Beach, of New South Wales, on the Parramatta
River, at Sydney, on Saturday, has excited the
greatest astonishment throughout England and
America. In both countries it is generally be-
lieved that Hanlan’s unexpected defeat must have
been the resu'tof some accident." Kindi •• otservo,
Mr. William, that the cablegram announcing the
squelching of the “Amurrukin Bind o’ Freedom”
by a back kick from the Invincible emu’s hind lea
was sent from Sydney to London at 6 p.m. on the
IQth, and it must have reached London in time to
be flashed over to the crumpled up Noo Yorkers
the same day, because, you see, the Age's return
message is dated the 16th also. Allowing for the
time occupied in getting tho Yanks to come to
and then explain to eacb other exactly how the
whole thing happened, we find that the news
travelled back from America to London and from
London out to the Melbourne Age in exactly six
houx-s. The average time Reuter takes to wire
home and get a reply is twenty hours, but intellect
conquers time, ana the Age conquers intellect
Try another lot of “tangle,” Mr. Shakespeare—do.
The first half of the English racing season
is roughly reckoned to end with the Ascot meet
and the returns for the first half-year show that
Archer, for the twelfth time in succession, ia far
away at the head of the list of the winning horse-
men. His record up to the Ascot close shows that
he has scored 95 successes against 131 failures
Admitting that the “ Tinman ” has the pick of the
mounts, and rides whenever and wherever he
thinks he has a show, the figures are still pheno-
menal. Wood, who is a most industrious rider
also, comes next to Archer, with 49 wins and 143
losses—that is to say, he has ridden about 1 winner
out of every 4 mounts. 8. Loates, the next on the
list has ridden about 1 winner out of everv 5
attempts; he has been in the pb skin 183 times
has lost 145, and won 38 races. Cannon's average
is [excellent, as nearly as possible 1 in 3; he has
scored 33 in 73 mounts. Little Martin, the infant
prodigy, is a trifle off his record, showing only
7 firsts out of 86 tussles. Cannon’s wee bill for
steering Little Duck in the Grand Prlx came £900
exactly; and, apropos of this, home papers inform
ua that Cannon’s v alet is very indignant at a para-
graph which appeared inthe Paris Morning News
to the effset that, after the Grand Prix, the Ducdu
Castries presented his master with four notes of
1000 francs each. “ 1 spent more than that myself "
said the valet, proudly. “ Cannon’s valet” is good
and we can now believe the story which says that
Sir ’Enry Parkes recently declared that if he
couldn’t be an angel, or a professional beauty, he
would like to bo a professional jockey. And he is
just about as fit for one thing as the other.
The Matterson v. Edwards match caused
no little excitement amongst aquatic men, and it
is a long time since we saw so much money flying
about at a second-class boat-race. It was stated
that the Clarence River boy had, with a tide under
him, broken 30 in a trial over the full course, and
his friends were jubilant accordingly, laying 5 to 2
and 3 to 1 on him freely. Edwards won the toss
and took the Southern shore, although we fancy
he took all the worst of it, as no tide to speak of
was encountered until the mile point was passed
and the Victorian had to drag over the flat to Uhr’s
point The two men rowed about ten stone and a
half, Edwards, if anything, having a pound or so
the best of it. The four sculls dipped together
and Edwards almost immediately showed to the’
front, gradually Increasing his lead until at Uhr’s
point he must have had nearly a length to the
good, which he lengthened out sufficiently to cross
over and take Matterson’s water half way to Blax-
lands. Edwards, by this time had commenced to
tire, and the Clarence River lad drew up till the
nose of his boat just overlapped Edwards’ stern,
and in this position they shot the mile in 6 minutes
35 seconds. A shrill blast then came from the
Admiral, Matterson’s steamer, which was evidently
the “office,” as he pulled round Edwards with
the greatest ease, and leaving him very much
as he liked, widened the gap to some eight
lengths at Putnoy. Edwards pulled a game race to
the bitter end, but Matterson merely played with
him over the remainder of the course, the judge’s
flag dropping at 33min. 35sec. Matterson is a wiry
customer, but to look at his good-looking face,
white skin, and almost womanly appearance, no
one would take him to be the stayer he is said, or
rather has proved to be. We understand Matter-
son is going to puli another race, and then lay up
till he thickens out. The “other race,” should it
be arranged, will probably be with his fellow
river man, Donald M'Donald; and, although Mat-
terson has proved himself an out-and-out good
youngster, he will, no doubt, find M'Donald game
of a very different calibre to the men ho has msde
such easy victims of. To our liking, the best bit
of rowing Matterson showed on Friday last was
when he did his preliminary canter. He threw
more swing into his body than ever we saw before,
but directly the race commenced, he relapsed into
his old style—reaching out with a clean grip of the
water only excelled by Hanlan, but after that
pulling a lot with his arms and meeting bis sculls
at the finish, his body never going back of the per-
pendicular. Should the youngster develop a swing
in the next two years, it is hard to say where game
will be found too big for him.
We notice Mr. Deebles, in a letter to the
Evening News, has come down a month, and
states Beach is willing to row Hanlan for £500 in
five months’ lime. If Beach alone had been con-
sulted in the matter, we feel pretty sure he would
rather have rowed Hanlan on the Saturday fol-
lowing the race, than wait five or six months.
Whetoer the Tomki interfered with the ex-oham-
pion’s chance, no one on earth but Hanlan can say;
but his reputation as a fculler is such that we may
rest assured both in England and America the
general belief will be that the Tomki, and not
Beat h, defeatedjthe Canadian—hard lines as it un-
doubtedly will bo for the Australian. A great deal
is made of the fact that Hanlan kept Trickett
running alter him for a return match; but, look-
ing at the two ca s es impartially, can they be con-
sidered analogous? Hanlan defeated Trickett from
end to end without a shadow of a doubt, whereas
Hanlan has certainly a good show for complaint,
be he right or wronf, at the manner in which he
was interfered with by the Tomki. That Hanlau
was short of condition, we firmly believe. We at
the lime disbelieved the yarn that on the Sunday
preceding the race he partook cf plum-pudding
swimming in fizz ?nd porter, but wo have since had
it on good authority that he did put himself outside
a plateful of this filth. If our information was cor-
rect, he must have betn about fit enough for a
trip across thebay to Gladesville. As for his work,
to our mind he was too fond of 100 yard spins and
loafing about on tee water, while Beach was doing
honest work over the full course. However, we
suppose they will meet again sooner or later—
sooner, we trust—when it is to be hoped the Tomki
will be where she is most suited for—on an ocean
trip—and that, should the Australian again be suc-
cessful, he will win it in a manner that will not
give our American cousins the possibility of a
bubble. Hanlan has hitherto pulled about list.,
but, if he goes through a preparation on tho Parra-
matta such as our scullers believe in, we do not
think he will step into his boat an ounce over Idst.
7lb.—rather light, certainly, to tackle such a 13st.
t'ger as Beach. That Hanlan is a good three
lengths in a mile better than Beach, the Austra-
lian’s greatest admirers must admit; and should he
get into tip-top condition and get a sufficient lead
to take a breather after the first mile burst, it
does not appear to us quite a certainty that he will
not take the championship back to Canada with
him.
Gall! Well, we should rather say it was.
As long as the hired assassins of the London Press
considered Mr. Murdoch and his merry, merry
men fit subjects for their fiercest invectives we
could rest content; but now that they have em-
ployed their “ corner men ’’—their drivelling idiots
who sling their bald-headed, unmeaning trash for
so-called comic journals, and thereby fill their
lunatic asylums with gibbering, jackass madmen—
now that they have engaged these dull dotaids to
point the finger of scorn at “ Our Boys,” we teei
desperate enough to rush out, and take to either a
monastic life or a 99 years’ bout of intoxication.
Bear gently with us as we quote the sarcastic cna:
of one of these screech-owls, who says— “Another
of those unpleasant episodes which now regularly
mark the preliminaries of all matches in which tne
Australians are engaged in this country took place
at Lord’s to-day. The first objection of tne
colonists was the curt refusal to play, unless bom
the M C.C. umpires were changed ;or nominees 01
the visitors (two N.S.W. men who—by accident, 01
course—chanced to be upon the ground). Atrei
this, two totally new wickets were pitane
to suit Messrs. Spofforth and Giflen, and tne
whole of the pavilion was placed unreservedly m
OFF FOR A MONTH.
WIFE (in alarm): “GREAT HEAVENS I I’VE MISLAID THAT LITTLE TIE I ALWAYS
WEAR WITH THIS DRESS, AND 1 KNOW IT’S IN SOME OF THESE TRUNKS. NOW DO
HURRY AND FIND IT FOR ME, FOR I’M SO AFRAID WE’LL MISS THAT BOAT I”


the disposal of the Australian colonists now in
London. The English captain having won the
toss was about to send in Messrs. Grace and Steel,
when the Australian captain, amid approving
cheers from his own men, objected to Mr. Steel’s
bat. This having been gauged and found correct,
Mr Murdoch objected to Mr. Steel himself; that
gentleman, it was urged, having made the bowling
of the Australians his particular study, his pre-
sence on the English side was a manifest injustice
to the colonial team, who were loud in their de-
mands for British fair play. Seeing there were
20 000 present, who might proceed to acts of vio-
lence if the Australians declined to play, Mr. Steel
made way for Mr. Studd, and the two men were
actually proceeding to the wickets when the Aus-
tralian captain again intervened, and said that
before commencing the match he must ca'l on the
M C.C. to guarantee that there should be no ex-
pression of public feeling in favour of the Eng-
lish, or adverse to the Australians, and that all
such cries as ‘Go it Jumbo,’ to Mr. Bonnor,
Bully for ithe Jiittle bandicoot,’ to Mr. Ban-
nerman, &e., be at once suppresses, these things
eeing apt to unduly excite the extremely ner-
nuu 8 of the delicately-reared Colo-
mais. This being agreed to, the match was about
m oegm when Mr. Murdoch stepped out once more
ana requested that the match should be played at
me Orleans’ Club, before visitors Invited by the
Australians only, as the presence and effluvia of
nh- v . classes was most offensive and strongly
onjected to by several most distinguished ladies
and gentlemen from Darling Point and Colling-
thi 0 * a matter of sheer impossibility,
me Australians threatened to start for home by
me next steamer unless the match was entered as
£ ame iu favour of themselves, and this
7~' of course, consented to in order to avert the
mo+catastrophe. Later advices declare the great

thJ 68 * 8 Domination of the home team is left to
vrmi^ 8tralian captain, who will also select the

Insults such as these can be wiped out by ber-lud
alone, and our War Department should at once see
about placing the Wolverene on wheels and trund-
ling her along to blow those blarstid Britishers off
the face of the earth entirely.
From the “ Journal of Thomas Raikes,
Esq., 18311817”: “Lady H.’s description of the
cholera in Russia was really frightful; but the
remedy used there with constant success was 20
drops of laudanum and 20 drops of spirit of am-
monia in a wine-glass of peppermint-water, which
never failad of success in the first instance.” Per-
haps the microbes of cholera have an educated
taste, suitable to the nineteenth century, and ob-
ject to remain in the company of a person who
smells of peppermint.
From an English paper“ An engineman.
from Chesterton, familiarly known as • Mad Jack.’
arrived home in a very wild state from drink, and
commenced to dig a hole in the garden, in which
he proposed to bury his wife. Mrs, Rowley (Mad
Jack’s wife), being in good health, did not assent
to this proposal, but her husband forced her into
the garden grave, and when she would not lie
down quietly and be buried, hit her a brutal blow
on the head with the spade. Owing to the unwill-
ingness of his wife to proceed against him, ‘ Mad
Jack ’ escaped with a fine.”
A cheery bigot who worships the Presby-
terian God in St. John's Church, Wellington, N.Z.,
deprecates the idea of Christians insuring premises
—as believers, they should commend the buildings
to the protection of the Almighty. This kinder
reminds one of precious Mr. Rutherford, who
opined that it was a heinous sin to counterwork
God by seeking to cure sickness. “ One should
have,” said be, “a sort of gladness in boils and
sores.” The Wellington ass, doubtless, similarly
supposes that it would be profanity to seek to pro-
vide against an act of Almighty arson.
A good yarn is told of a wealthy station-
owoeron t)je tyestepp border of Queensland, Some
years ago he was out on the run one day, accom-
panied by a stockman. They had taken "o tucker
with them from the station, and as the afternoon
wore on the hired man commence! to grumble.
Quoth the boss, “I wouldn’t give a d— tor a man
who can’t live on grass for a day or two.” “ Well,
I ain’t goin’ to do that; so we'd better part com-
pany,” said the stockman. According'y he was
paid off next day. A short time since the boss was
driving down to Birdsville, and one evening
brought up at a fencer’s camp, where he concluded
to stop for the night. Before taking his horses
out ot the buggy, however, he discovered that his
hobbles were missing. Thinking he might be able
to borrow a couple of pairs from the fencers, he
walked over to the camp, and addressing himself
to the only man visible, the following dialogue
ensue!:—“Good evening.” “Good evenin’, sir.”
“Could you oblige me with a couple of pairs of
hobbles till to-morrow ?—I’ve lost mine.” “ Sar-
talnly: here y’ are,” (producing three pairs). : ‘Oh,
tnanks, but two pairs w 11 bo sufficient.” “You’d
better take the lot.” “ But I don’t require them."
“ Oh, yea, yer do, boss! Yer so d fond o' grass
yer’ll want a pair for yerself, cos I’m d if yer’ll
get anything here in the tucker line.” It was his
old stockman.
In the way of piety combined with resig-
nation to “the will of the Lord,” the noble Hiber-
nian can concede many points to all-comers, and
then haul in the prize. Sometimes, however, an
exception turns up, which, according to the best
authorities, goes to prove the rule. There is a
story told of a farmer living up Queanbeyan way
who rejoices in the Celtic patronymic of O’Sorae-
thing-or-other — a man in what may be called
“purty aisy circumstances,” or, as he aptly de-
scribes the situation in speaking of his social
position. “ I’m a farmer, and a purty sthrong
farmer at that:” meaning, of course, that he is on
the verge of squatterdom, but not altogether re-
cognised as such. Old O S. is the proud father of
as line a family of boys and girls “ as you’d wish to
clap eyee ou especially t&0 two eldest boys, who
were the apples of the parental eye. One of the
young men, however, was cut down in the flower
of his youth, the loss being keenly felt by the old
man; and, shortly afterwards, the other boy was
taken ill, and his case was considered very critical.
It was an anxious time for old O’S.. and meeting a
neighbour one day who inquired kindly after the
health of the young man, the affected parent re-
plied, with some emotioa, “ Oh, then, ’tis very bad
intlrely he is; and if it should plaze the Lord to
take away poor Mike as well as the other one,
begorra. He can take the lot of them.” Thus.
you see that there are times when even pious resig-
nation fails to fill the book.
The special who is doing Queensland
Sugar and the Kanaka for Granny is a quaint
mixture of Conservative and Radical. Me believes
in nigger labour, and thinks that coolies should be
introduced under conditions that would prevent
their entering into competition against the white
man outside the canetields. He is a firm believer
that the planter is the best friend of the kanaka,
to whom £18 for three years’ hard labour is (or
ought to be considered by the islander) a princely
remuneration. But, whilst staunch to those com-
mercial interests whereof Granby is a buttress,
ho is, singularly enough, rough on the parson.
“Whether,” says he, “the gospel of hard work-
earning broad by the sweat of the brow—is not the
best civiliser of the kanaka is a question I leave
to others; but if it bethought desirable to Chris-
tianise the boys, I would like to know, as a matter
of curiosity, why it should be deemed absolutely
necessary to carry out the conversion of the
kanaka on his native Island, and absolutely of no
consequence to attend to his spiritual wants when
he becomes a labourer on a sugar plantation ? . .
. . There is not, that I am aware, the slightest,
the faintest attempt made by the ministers of
religion here to Christianise the kanakas on the
plantations. I do not know of any cases whatever
in which they visit the kanakas.” For our own
part, we conceive that this non-visitation by the
minister of religion must be the one measure of
sweetness in the kanaka’s slave life up North,

If “ three removes are as bad as a fire,” it
certainly has not proved so in the case of the
Sydney Owl O uh; and the fact is only another
proof of how th<se old ad«gos yet knocked over
every ti ne they are tested in real life. There's
that humorous proverb about “honesty is the
but we will go slow; for we are honest ourselves.
And although that particular line of policy has
not as yet pushed us very tar up in the world, still,
in the interest* of morality, we will not discour-
age others. If you took ah the rich men in
Sydney has their policy but there; we really
must stop—it is dangerous to meddle with these
time-honoured maxims. We had better leave them
alone, all except the one the Owls have so com-
pletely upset. Th°ir removes have marked an in-
crease' of success every time, until at last the Pro-
testant Hall became too small—to say nothing of
its ridgy floor. For their opening hyginx of this
season, t he Owls chose the new Masonic Hall The
gallery there is so convenient and cosy, and alto-
gether th<re seemed to be more room, notwith-
standing the large company. In taking the chair,
their president, Mr. G. W. Tate, announced that
the Owls being a social body. Intended to have no
programmes—the inference being that pro-
grammes tend rather to cliquishness than to foster
a social feeling among friends. So they do. For
those who go for no other purpose than dancing,
the programmes are convenient, and enable them
to secure the best partners, but there is likely
to be more general friendliness without them.
In the concert, too, the charm of speculation
was added to the pleasure of expectancy. Messrs.
Shepherd and viaxted did most of the accompany-
ing. and the opening song was Herr Von Sandon’s
“Galatea.” Miss Maggie Alderdlce, who looked
dainty enough in a tucked white lawn with a bird
at the throat, sang a serenade nicely. Signor
Giammona accompanied himself as he sang
“ Mamma, No,” and Mr. Ward gave “ Out on the
Deep.” Dr. A. Burno recited “Casablanca,” as an
English, Scotch, Irish, Frenchman, or a dude
would say it—the last, of course, being in a lan-
fuage seldom heard out of the Zoological Gardens,
t was a clever and well-studied performance.
“ Queen of the Night ” was trilled by Mrs. Solo-
mon, a pretty brunette, who would have looked
even more so had she raised her bright eyes now
and then. A catchv quartette by gentlemen—
“The Three Chafers”—was well sung, and when
the four singers suddenly stopped in toe full flow
of their melody, solemnly looked at one another,
and then walked off the stage, this ending was
effective enough to cause an immediate encore.
and the piece was partly repeated. Herr Francik’s
violin selections, ac mmpanied by Madame King,
were sweet, and afterward? “Shrike” chanted a
comic song Mr. 8. James gave " I heard a voice ”;
Signor Vittorini rolled out “The Bugler” with
great spirit, every word being heard with power
and distinctness. “ Vashtl,” by a lady followed,
and then Mr. Harry Leston gave a recitation in his
rich native language—which he naively calls
“Italian.” After an uproar of applause, became
on again, and gave “ The Controlling Influence of
Drink” with equal success. “Yellowhammer”
piped a ba lad, and then refreshments were passed
round, and dancing began. It would be quite an
open question who wore the handsomest dress,
but several in the room might have a claim.
Mrs. Griffin wore one, an ivory ottoman
broche, trimmed with white plumes and line
lace, and the skirr. in their silky flounces
edged with lace, and all dotted with large golden
pompons. Mrs. Solomon wore another delightful
creation, of garnet broche, panier bodice, and
cream corded silk skirt, bunched with artistic care.
Mrs. Joseph’s costume was beautiful, being all
satin, the cardinal bodice glimmering above a
lovely amber skirt, with a su tpiclon of pink in it.
Its brunette wearer could dance, too. Mrs.
Burnc’s cream brocade, with a flash here and there
of faint purple ribbon, was another source of
admiration. But the married ladies did not mono-
polise all that was good. A little blonde looked
well in white, with strawberry ribbons; a clever
dancer was all in tile-coloured Fatin; a really rich
drees was all of blue broche, with high collar and
broad bands of white beading whic ■ gave it a
brilliant finish; a Redfern young lady wore a nice
ivory broche and veiling skirt; and a handsome
§lrl, who kept her head the wrong way when
ancing, wore a very pretty toilet of deep blue
satin, with front breadth and hack drapery of ecru
figured silk, ecru gloves. A Prymont young lady,
with short h dr done like a boy’s, was chdrming In
her blue, the veiling skirt flounced upon one side
and the other side draped with satin panier from
the bodice. A North Shore visitor was very lovely
in clover-pink veiling, with finest white lace edg-
ing, and white flowers in the hair. Madame King
wore a rich apple green satin, decked with red
flowers, and covered with black net. The hyginx
closed about 3 a.m.

Early in August, the grandest wedding
took place that has ever occurred in New Cale-
donia. It was the wedding of Miss Higginson,
eldest daughter of tho “Nickel King,” with Mr.
Pellaton, engineer of the Company. Nearly 400
guests were present to demolish a lunch given at
4 p.m. in the large room adjoining the town hall.
The purveying was done by Mr, Bonane, steward
of the clu , champagne, Clicquot, and the finest
w nes were freely flowing, and the bridal cake was
a monument of confectionery genius. The hall
was specially decorated and upholstered in a way
seldom equalled in the older colonies; and the
dresses of the ladies were brilliant enough for the
salons of gay Paris itself. At 9 o’clock the ball
began, with tho band from He Nou playing dance
music, and two hundred ladies whirled around to
its strains. All the old colonists were there. Mr.
Higginson not forgetting one of them in his broad
invitation, he being one of the oldest himself.
Everyone was glad to see Mrs. Porcheron, the
wife of the late Mayor, an aged lady, who looked
like tho mother of all. Altogether, Mr. Higginson
made it a grand affair. Ten years ago, ladies were
a scarcity in Noumea. Now, the rising generation
is beginning to outnumber the males, and anyone
who saw them tint night would say that the
growing belles bid fair to rival in beauty the fair-
est of their Australian sisters.
* * •
Balmaia School of Arts was, on Friday, the
scene of the Collingwood Cricket Club’s second
annual ball, and a pleasant one it was. Only a
few months ago, the club changed its colours from
crimson to the yellow and black also taken by the
rowing dub, and made famous by Beach, and so
the new colours were worn by a lotof members on
Friday with a considerable amount of pride. Mr.
R. Neilson, hon. sec. of the C.O.C., though not
great in stature, is one of the demons of the dis-
trict “ behind the sticks,” and, in the ballroom, as
genial a fellow as ever looked after the comfort of
the ladies. Flags, and a large “ wel.ome ” worked
in purple rosettes, adorned the hall, the floor was
prepared, and Shapter’s band kept striking up the
music from 9 o'clock till nearly 5 in the morning.
After filtering through the dressing-rooms—the
ladies' being distinguished by the luxury of a look-
ing-glass and the gentlemen's by having no seats,
which teaches them to roost on one foot while they
shoe the other—the company was found large
enough to quite fill the hall, and gay enough to
turn the head of anyone bnt a thoroughly har-
dened reporter. The young men of Balmain are a
singularly blessed fraternity, not only because of
the festive scenes gladdened by beauty’s presence
in which they so often revel, but because they
themrelves are the objects of so much tender
solicitude from the native girls. On this occasion,
the gallery was full of gills, quite, more than full;
and no one supposes that girls come to look at one
another. If they didn t come to look at the young
men. what d d they com * for ? Every time there
Is a dance in the School of Arts, there is a proces-
sion of Balmain girls up to the doors; those who
can. get in; those who can’t, stand outside and
gaze io with modified pleasure. Even in Paradise,
all the angels cannot get inside at once, and it s
just the same at Balmain; so they crowd round
the doors. There were some capital dancers to
be whirling through the throng ; none
better than a local young lady in dark blue
velvet b >dice, over a flowered skirt of white India
muslin. The cousin of a well-known bicyclist from
Darling-street was neat and cheery lu a red-ob cled
black net dress: and from near the Council Cham-
bers came a young lady looking well in a nice
cream veiling costume, which was elaborated by a
number of orossbands sloping seductively off to
one side, and some pink ribbons here and there
Miss Herring danced airily in her pink; and Misses
Prout in cream. Two Darling-street sisters ca ve
—one in ruby and pink, the other in cardinal and
pink was a shade lighter in dress, but no one was
lighter in dancing than either. Misses Neilson
looked extremely nice in white lawn and blue
riobons, io keeping with their fresh and brigm
young faces; and Miss Wilkinson had managed a
p ouliarly neat fit in her peacock bodice «nd tasty
cream veiling skirt. A striped lavender dress of
sensibly light material for dancing was worn by
Miss Flynn of Newcastle, who had brightened it
with raspberry-coloured broche, and altogether
made it and herself very charming. A little bru-
nette in blue satin and white lace from Beattie-
street was a favourite; and a young lady from
Kegnolds-street, enjoying her maiden ball, looked
as pretty as heart s desire in her pure white dress
and dainty flowers. Another pretty girl was Miss
Barrell, In white tinselled grenadine and straw silk
skirt—a single Barrell, who is sure to go off. An
evcol ent supper provided in the large back room
by Oldlan.

When Oscar started knee-breeches he was
laughed at. But Oscar laughs last. Men are really
recognising that they are sightly and convenient.
The spread ot athletics has had much to do with
this. Footballers wear them everywhere. Old
country tourists walk in them. Bicyclists can
hardly tolerate any other. They are the really
correct wear for tennis playing. In many old
country places, sea-side towns, and even in cities,
they are at this moment recognised as conven-
tional morning wear. It is but a step for them to
become conventional evening wear. To object
that all men have not good calves is forceless.
Everyone knows that, and everyone would soon
become used to actual demonstration of the fact.
Moreover, our forefathers wore them, just as our
lady ancestors wore huge hoops; and if the less
sensible be revived, the more so can be at any
time. But, why suppose ? They are now actually
seen in London drawing-rooms in the evening.
They are the coming change, to vary the long un-
disturbed monotony of man’s dress suit. We only
wanted to break the news gently.

“ May tears never dim the lovelightof her eye,
May her life be all Spring weather ”
was the pretty wish of Gerald Massey to his wife
many years ago, before he took to grey hair and
spectacles, and while a long way off from the tem-
ple gate of fame. No bride could leave the altar
with a prettier prayer from the hearts of her
friends, and numbers of them wished it, though
they may not ha ve said it in the graceful poet’s
words, to the bride who was the centre of attrac-
tion on Wednesday week, the 30th, in St. George’s
Church. A large assembly of ladles, all “nods
and becks and wreathed smiles,” as usual on such
happyjoccaslons, gathered to witness Miss Fanny
M’Leod married to Mr. David Carnegie Simpson
(resident engineer, Cootamundra railway), and the
church was elaborately decked with greenery.
The aisles were arched with leaves, and a massive
cable depended across from one gallery to the
other. The service was read under a large arch of
foliage, interwoven with white roses * nd lilies,
and from the top hung a horseshoe on a bridal
ribbon. At half-past one, the bride, a sweetly
pretty girl, entered on the arm ot her father, Mr
John M’Leod, of Dunvegan House, Ultimo, Her
dress was a dead white ottoman silk, beautifully
made, with long train edged with simple
frilling of lace, and the front of skirt flounced
with Limerick lace; the wreath was of orange-
blossom and jasmine, and the tulle veil finely
broidered. The bride also wore a seed pearl
brooch given by the groom, a handsome diamond
bracelet the gift of Messrs. M’Credie Brothers,
and a gold bracelet presented by Mr. Kahlo, The
bridesmaid*. Miss Christina M’Leod, Miss Jessie
M’Credie, Miss Maggie Neilson, and Miss Beatie
Donald, were a quartette of beauties whose entry
caused a rustle through the church. They wore
skirts of pale heliotrope silk with kilted edging,
bodices and drapery of heliotrope nun’s veiling
caught up with violet velvet rosettes; poke bon-
nets lined with violet velvet and trimmed with
violet pansies, "nd the pale heliotrope ribbons were
fastened In a large bow under the chin with gold
brooches given by the bridegroom. In the wno'e
of these dainty bridal dresses, Miss Walker’s artis-
tic taste produced a harmony of colour and effect
that would have delighted the soul of Gerald
Massey himself. A number of family relatives
were among those present in the church, and some
really beautiful costumes were displayed. Mrs.
John M’Leod, the bride’s step-mother, wore a
handsome seal-brown dress ot ottoman cord com-
bined with brown and gold brocade, and bon-
net with brown feathers to match; her aunt,
Mrs. Forbes, wore a brown and old gold,
with brown velvet bonnet and tuft of old gold
feathers ; Mrs. M'Kay, also au aunt, a black cos-
tume and black lace bonnet. Mrs. John Harris
wore dove silk and heliotrope broche with long
train, cream lace pelerine, and pretty bonnet to
correspond with her dress; Mrs. James Barnet, a
very rich black satin, with trimming of black and
gold, black bonnet to match; Mrs. Matthew Harris,
velvet broche in a pretty shade of deep grey and
ardoise, white lace cape, bonnet with tuft of pink
feathers ; Mrs. Charles Kahlo, a black broche
velvet, stylish and rich, bonnet matching; Mrs
John Taylor, a prune satin dress trimmed with
gold lace; Mrs. Donald (Newcastle), a fine black
satin dress, with cream and pink bonnet; Mrs.
Neilson (Wallsend), ahandsome black broche, with
cream bonnet; Mrs. Noble, a nut-brown satin and
broche. with cream lace bonnet; Mrs. T. H. Saps-
ford, a shot-silk costume of amethyst and gold
tints, very tastefully made; Mrs. Cullen, a
pretty dress of chocolate brown, with trim-
ming of chocolate and gold brocade; Mrs. Alex-
ander Dean, a costume of that pretty grey
known as ecosse, bonnet the same; Mrs. W. Smith,
black broche dress, and small hat tufted with pink
feathers—her fairy ike little daughter, with long
flaxen hair, wearing white cashmere, and a large
Leghorn hat with wheatear trimming. Mrs.
M’Donald (Balmain) wore a rich black satin dress
and a cream bonnet; and Miss M’Donald a delicious
dress of apricot pink veiling in the Mary Anderson
style, with cream hat and feathers. Miss Maggie
Smith wore one of the most recherche costumes
there, a skirt of cardinal satin, kilted, and polo-
naise of smoke-coloured cashmere; straw hat,
with bouquet of deep red daisies. Mrs. H. Creer
adopted a ladylike costume of dark-brown velvet
and broche; and Miss Creer a dark shade of elec-
tric cashmere, princess bonnet, and gloves to
match. Mrs Purkis wore a costume of brown
cashmere, and velvet bodice: Mrs. Frank M’Leod,
a dark grey, with broche of two shades forming
the trimming; Miss Maude Turner, a ruby cash-
mere and cream lace. Miss Bella Watson looked
stylish, and as lively as usual, in a pretty
checked silk dress, and straw bonnet with apricot
feathers; her sister wearing a peculiar and very
trying shade, only redeemed by a very pretty
bonnet. Miss M. M’Credie’s fawn cashmei-e was
brightened with bouquet of deep-red poppies at
the throat, large hat similarly adorned. Misses
Jackson, three sisters, looked neat and nice in
pretty fawn costumes; and so did Mrs. Hammond,
in a brown dress relieved with primrose silk; and
Mrs. J. M’Donald, in prune silk and cream bonnet
with marabout tufts. Miss Kahlo wore a hand-
some costume of cocoa-brown cloth, set off with
cardinal; and Miss Dean, a checked grey silk, with
satin vest front and skirt tablier of deep sea-blue.
Miss Bradbury’s dress was a nice black satin, and
her small hat trimmed with ruby velvet and paie-
pink tips. Mies Sutherland also wore a neat black,
of silk, and a quantity ot mauve gossamer. One
of th** most stylish costumes was that worn by
Miss Weekes, an animated brunette; it was of
white cashmere, with a feather ruche down the
breast, and the plain skirt was bordered with
rows of gold braid, with which, and golden
butterflies, the bodice was also ornaqjented;
gold bonnet trimmed with white gauze and
golden butterflies, long tan gloves. For break-
fast, the company drove to Nithsdale Rooms,
where Callaghan had spread tho tables, and some
merry speeches were made. The Rev. G. Sutner-
land, who had performed the ceremony neatly
described as “ collecting all the heart’s sweet ties
into one knot of happiness,” was proposer or tne
“ Bride and Bridegroom.” and the “ Bridesmaids
were proposed by the best man, Mr. J. B. M Kenzie
—the other gx-oomsmen being Messrs. Bell, Wood-
ward, and Taylor. “Absent Friends,” ‘ Host and
Hostess,” and other toasts all came in turn, and
the feast was livened by the music from a band
provided by Mr. Needs. After breakfast, the
temptation to stroll into the ball-room adjoining
was too great to resist, and two or three hours
dancing followed. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson started
for their honeymoon to Moss Vale and Melbourne,
amid a shower of good wishes from their many
friends.
* * •
A very enjoyable entertainment, under
tho auspices of St. Peter’s Ath etio Club, was held
in the local Town Hall on the evening of Tuesday,
12th lost. The chair was occupied by Mr. W. Ed-
wards, the Mayor, and there was a large attend-
ance. Some choice selections were played by Mrs.
Neil, and the Misses LeeJer, Turner, and Guide;
and the vocalists were Messrs. Fewings, Clark,
Davenport, Elliott, Barry, Leeder, and H. Llpp-
mann, all of whom sang with spirit, and obtained
encores, Messrs. Bidwell, Halverston, and Smith
recited. During the Interval, the ex-Mayor, Mr.
Judd, presented the prizes to the winners at the
recent sports gathering, held on the St. Peters
cricket ground.

The seventh of the Newtown Private
Socials was held Friday last in the Oddfellows’ Hall,
Newtown. Over thirty couples put in an appear-
ance, the fair sex, as usual, having a majority.
Petersham sent a pretty blonde, Cavendish-street
represented by two capital dancers, two sisters
from Wilson-street looked charming, a lady from
the city (In the vocal line) danced well, York-
street represented by about the best dancer in the
room, Alice-street sent three sisters, all capital
dancers, Paddington sent a jolly brunette, Pitt-
street a pretty blonde, Glebe Point a charming
blonde in cream and lace. Bent-street the ever-
obliging little lady, Stanmore Road two sisters,
splendid dancers. The music was splendid, being
in the hands ot Kopff and Austin. As these Socials
are growing in popularity, the next, on 17th Sep-
tember, will, no doubt, be one of their largest
gatherings.
The Town Hall, Petersham, was on Friday
the scene of another of those pleasant reunions
which have so distinguished that pleasant little
society, La Coterie, since its birth. On this occa-
sion, however, La Coterie took a higher flight, the
entertainment consisting principally of a farce
and a drama. “Xoi on Parle Fran9ais” was the
old familiar friend that made us laugh, if only
from the force of old associations. When we were
a boy but, there! we will keep in the present
century; life’s too short for recollections. Major
Regulus Rattan, by Mr. C. Alderdice, was a very
creditable performance; and so was the Victor
Dubois of Mr. Tom Godbolt. Mr. Spriggins, in the
hands of Mr. P. A. Jenkins, also came in for a good
share of approval. But the sterner sex was
crowded out in this little arrangement, the ladies
doing all the trade. There was Mrs. Spriggins -
delineated by a talented lady, whose nom de
theatre, Bella Clava, enveloped its wearer in a veil
of mystery which we yearned to penetrate, until
we heard there was a “ Mrs.” at the beginning
of it, when all things became dark. Miss Wilson
enacted the part of Angelina Spriggins with
ease and gracefulness; and Miss Williams was a
vivacious Julia. There is a maid-of-all-work
in this piece —Anna Maria —which character
found a charming expositor in Miss Gregory.
We have since ceased to wonder why it was
that cerfain dukes among our ancestors sought
Cinderellas as their brides. How true it is that
the greatness of genius will assert Itself, whether
it be the parlour or the kitchen great! A piano-
forte solo, very ably rendered by Miss Turner—
who, by the way, also contributed the overture
with much success—hyphened the farce on to the
the second piece, “ The Chimney Corner,” a con-
ception which revealed the peculiarities of three
generations of Probitys in an amusing manner.
Giving place to the dames —of whom, in this piece,
there were two—it is to be stated that the fair
anonyma before referred to acquitted herself
most successfully as Patty Probity, while the
Grace Emery of Miss Wilson was distinguished by
the same consistency which marked this lady’s
previous perfoimance. Mr. Tom Godbolt’s re-
presentation of old Solomon Probity was of a
character rarely seen among amateurs, and his ob-
literation of self in the whimsical nonogenarian
deserved the approval it met with. Mr. J. T.
Craven as Peter Probity, Mr. T. W, Beves as
John Probity, Mr. John Barry as Charles Chetty,
and Mr. E. Fewings as the detective Sifter,
were all good in their several parts. With
a little more care, the histrionic talent
of La Coterie ought to come out strong.
The entertainment was witnessed by a large and
fashionable audience. On the descent of the cur-
tain, dancing was commenced by the majority,
and, with the musical assistance of sundry gifted
amateurs, the evening was concluded in an enjoy-
able manner. Many tasteful costumes graced the
room, amongst which may be mentioned those of
the Misses Alderdice, composed of white grass
cloth; Miss Leeder, in white tarletan and cerise;
a lady from the Glebe in a cloud of pink, whose
dancing was perfection. Two visitors from the
city in blue and wnite did sad execution in one
particular corner; and a little lady of Croydon
looked very charming in similar colours. One
exquisite figure was adorned by a pink satin dress
with deep lace flounces. The wife of a prominent
M P. appeared in black silk, trimmed broche,
and cream lace. Two ladies from the South-
ern city looked very pretty—one in helio-
trope satin with flounces of the same mate-
rial edged with cream lace, and wearing flowers
at the throat and breast; the , other simply
attired in pure white, tastefully enlivened by
coloured ribbons. A beautiful little dancer from
across the road bewitched in a pink cashmere
princess robe cut low at the throat, with a bunch
of flowers at the breast. From Ashfleld came a
sprightly belle robed in a sea-green costume flow-
ing with lace, cut low on the neck and fixed up
with flounoings edged with the same material. A
noted singist from over the water looked very
stylish in a black broche satin. The hall was de-
corated by a plentiful dado ot wall-flowers, who
appeared to find more pleasure in looking on than
in venturing on a floor which was certainly not in-
vitingly smooth. Amongst them could be noticed
the ladies belonging to the parties of more than
one popular associate of the club, whose absence
from the revolving crowd was much lamented. It
is observable that Beach’s colours are not much
worn by ladies—perhaps on account of their ter-
rible conspicuousness—and we looked yearningly
and almost in vain for some sign of sympathy with
the Champion. But, when twinkling feet were
growing fewer, we sighted the familiar hue on the
becoming toilet of a lady who hailed from the
scene of the victory. We don’t know why we ner-
vously accused the ribbon of being pink, or why
we tried to break her arm, or tread on her feet, in
a vague anxiety to distinguish ourselves before
her. We only know that when she went, the
“gold turned to furze blossom,” and we closed
our note-book sadly and went, too.

Next, Wednesday the annual St. Vincent's
Hospital ball takes place in the Exhibition Build-
ing, and, from the number of tickets already out,
the committee look for a really good festivity.
Even those who do not usually go to such affairs,
might well break their rule tor so excellent an
object, for St. Vincent’s Hospital is one of the in-

The TOWKSHTP of WESTMEAD is situate on

about acres of beautifully undulating land,
sloping towards the Park, and the soil is of the
richest pos-lble description It was formerly
known as Oakes’ Orchard, and the orange trees
are still on the ground, yielding luxuriant crops;
but land in this locality has become too valuable
for orchard purposes, being needed for the exten-
sion of the to n of Parramatta. The Proprietor
of the Estate has, upon the Auctioneers' recommen-
dation, decided to r.ell this township in small allot-
ments, on such terms as will come within the
means of struggling respectable working men,
lathers of families, and others. The Allotments,
as will be seen by the plan, are all carefully laid
out, in such a manner as to afford every facility
tor drainage, and thus preserve the salubrity of
the locality, and avoid the mistakes which have
been made in nearly all the suburbs near Sydney
(which threaten to become more unhealthy than
the City of Sydney itself.) The streets have been
laid out 68 feet wide, as provided for by Act of
Parliament. The price of these allotments, after
the llrst auction sale, will be from £33 to £40 each,
and the terras of sale are £L deposit and the re-
mainder by quarterly payments of £1 each with-
outlnterest; the title is Torrens’Act. Shouldany
buyer desire to pay for bis allotment at any
earlier time than the above terms specify, he will
be allowed a discount at the rate of 5 per cent, per
annum. Westmead is admirably placed for the

It is close to the large and rapidly incrcasingtownsi
of GrAnville and Parramatt i, and in the centre of
the large orchards for which the district is so
famed. Employment is abundant, and there are
openings for numerous industries, while even for
those engaged in business in Sydney the railway
tares are so cheap, and the trains from Parramatta
so frequent, that there is every inducement for a
family to live in this healthy district, rather than
pay a high rent in the crowded city.

'ji'he festivities to mark 1 he railway open-
ing to Glen lanes were as great as the importance
of the event demanded; but they were not all
j y. The weather was biting cold, rainy ana
snowy. Visitors poured in by hundreds, till beds
'wetC above ftfl price. A pound sterling was a fre-
quent offer fra bed, and five shillings was gladly
•paid for lodging room on a boarded floor for a few
short ttoisy hours of the night. On the Tuesday
meaning of the opening, three crammed trains
Went from Armldale with the latest batch of
visitors, and the enthusiasts waiting for them on
the Glen Innes platform had the full benefit
of a heavy shower of sleet, followed by snow.
The Ministerial party was met and cordially
welcomed by Mr. F. Ufz, Mayor of Glen lines,
and taken in procession to Tattersall’s Hotel.
Cripps’s banquet was attended by 350 persons, and
the waiters ever since are awe-struck when the
name of a Glen innes man is mentioned, Mr J.
Martin proposed “The Governor of the fairest
most beautiful portion of; Her Majesty’s
dominion.” We consider this a pretty strong
blow of the Glen Innes trumpet. There were
only fourteen other toasts proposed. During the
feed the principal seat gave way, and the Mayor
and Minister Dibbs rolled ignomiuiously under the
table. and wore extricated amid much unfeeling
laughter. At night, a ball took place in the engine
isheu, at which a lea Innes girl and a Tamworth
beauty divided the honours. It was a remarkable
ball in many ways, but chiefly because the gay and
festive people who went to it wore their ulsters
and hats in the ball-room, and those who could
fight best got most supper. There was one brief
"onslaught of the local gentry, and the supper
withered away, leaving not one piece of cake
•upon another to reward the ladies who braved
the ley passage from the ball-room in search of
’sustenance. The merry wind swept through the
airy hall, and up through the half-made roof, and
raged round the gasoline lamps that flickered
over the cheerless scene; clouds hid the bare and
shivering shoulders of the northern belles from
their admirers’ eyes; an air of dispirit brooded
over the company, and many stole disappointed
away from a ball-room that was invaded by such
borean blasts. Outside one door, the locomotive
pit had been carefully left uncovered, and a num-
ber of influential men, including the Hon. Dibbs
and some heavy, members of Parliament, success-
fully tumble! therein in a way that provoked
them to use]Anglo-Saxon language of the strong-
est kind that's made. A fair pine floor was put
down, the Town Band played pretty well, and the
ball closed at 4 a.m.

„ Sydney, Wednesday.
DEAREST BeLle,—Did you observe in 1 at week's
cablegrams that Liszt, tne musical composer, had
been afflicted with total blindness? Poor fellow!
How we used to hate his name when we were at
school, and had to practice his compositions by
the hour together! And it was only when wo hud
leftschool, and were no longer compelled to labour
through his “Rhansodle,” etc., mat our hatred
Changed to admiration of his genius, and it gradu-
ally dawned upon us that the great ra-n had other
objects in view when writing his difficult music
than that of plaguing poor school girls. They say
that when Wagner died he (Liszt) was almost
heart-broken, so perhaps that has something to do
with his blindness.
You have often hoard Madame Cbarbonnet-
Kellermann speak of her great master, Mons. Le
Couppey, of the Paris Conservatoire of Music.
Well, the other day. one of Madamo’s Sydney
pupils went over to the Continent, and, whilst in
Paris, called on Mot}#. Lo Couppey, who, w.ien ho
understood whose pupil she had been, received
her most cordially, invited her to play to him, and
pronounced her performance to be a credit to his
best beloved and most intelligent pupil, Mademoi-
selle Alice Churbonnet. So you see oven in Paris,
where there are si many fine musicians, Madamo's
talents were acknowledged and appreciated; and.
as everybody here knows, she is one of tho lew
first-class performers who has the art of imparting
her knowledge to others.
The principal themes of conversation this week
are the three forthcoming concerts and—small-
pox. Last week, it was nothing but the Hanlan-
Beach boat-race. And, oh I it was so funny the
other night at the Royal, when Beach was pre-
sented with a gold watch by Messrs. Williamsoc,
Garner, and Musgrove; he did look so awkward,
and seemed to wish himself -■nywhere but where
he was. When he tried to speak, be first scratched
the back of his leg and then his head, and at last
blurted out that he wasn't much of a speaker, but
when it was a matter of rowing, why, he was all
there. Modest, wasn’t it? And then he tried to
pull his fore-lock to the audience, but as he hadn’t
any to puil, we had to take the will for he deed.
But what roars of enthusiabm came from the
people! Now, I wonder—I Jus' wonder—it any-
thing like the same demonstrative enthusiasm
would have been shown had little Willie Sheppard
(he used to be little Willie, you know, dear, when
he went to school with us a f< w years ago), who
has this year taken rank as Senior Wrangler at
Trinity College, stood in Beach’s place. 1 fear not,
as this is undoubtedly an age of muscle; brains are
a secondary consideration. But, about these con-
certs. Don’t you think it very foolish to crowd
them all into one week ? The worst of it is, thev
am all to be so good that we positively cannot
afford to lose one of them. To-night is the Vogrich
concert; to-morrow, the Rita-Radcliff, and on
Friday night the Metropolitan Liedertafei are to
give one for ladies and gentlemen, which, I hear,
isjto be better than anything they have yet given
Our only plan will be to lake a good long siesta
each day, so as to be fresh and ready to enjoy the
music at night.
“The Merry Duchess” is such a bright little
opera, and was given for the first time at the
Royal on Saturday night. I am half sorry that
I promised to tell you what I thought of Miss
Grade Plaisted, the new star, tor opinions are so
varied concerning bor. For instance, when she
first made her appearance on Saturday evening
Ned exclaimed “By Jove! isn t she pretty?” I
replied that 1 didn’t think so. “Then you girls
never con see beauty in anybody but yourselves.”
“Oh, yes, we can.” I replied; “Fanny Liddiard is
pretty, and Nellie Stewart has a kind of saucy
prettiness of her own, though her nose is rather
small.” “ Well,now (afterthe birdsoug). perhaps,
Mab, you will allow that she can sing?” “Yes,
she can sing,—though, for my part, I prefer a
steadier voice, where the tremolo is only heard
occasionally.” “ The tremolo ! why that's just
what I liked about it—it’s part and parcel of the
song.” “All very well, Ned, my boy, but, if I’m
not mistaken, we shall hear it all through the
opera.” He wouldn’t believe me, but I was right,
dear. Still, for all that, Miss Plaisted is an acquisi-
tion, and her acting is very bright and natural.
Tbe dresses in the piece are very handsome. Nellie
Stewart, as the Duchess, wears a brocade of fawn
colour and crimson, fawn felt hat with cdmmn
plumes. I never saw Miss Liddiard looking so
sweetly pretty as she did in a pale heliotrope
satin, with cream hat, and feathers to correspond
with the dress. It was a charming costume, and
suited her admirably. In the circle there were
also many handsome toilettes. There was a pair
of black Jace dresses with short sleeves and enor-
mous bouquets on the left shoulders. But I never
like to see two dresses exactly alike—it looks too
much like a uniform, and shows want of idea on
somebody’s part. A French white silk jupe was
worn with a black velvet bodice laced down the
front and cut square. The sole ornaments were
small gold b. ads round the throat and in the hair.
A black silk grenadine, copiously besprinkled with
large crimson chenille pompons, was worn by a
dark lady, and looked very rich and stylish. A
novelty was a full bertha of real violets worn with
a white satin dress, and extremely pretty it was,
too, and the perfume from the violets was ex-
quisite. Men are always finding hideous names
for our fashions. What do you tnink they call
those long loose ». raceful Jabots? Kangaroo
pouches! How are we to wear them alter that?
Too bad, isn’t it?
In Brisbane they are far more Continental in
their ideas than wo are here. It is no uncommon
thing at a c rtain fashionable watering place to
see ladies and gentlemen in becoming bathing cos-
tumes make for the sea just as naturally as if they
were all going for a str oll. And whr not ? The
ladies seem to prefer blue serge trimmed with
crimson braid and Tam-o’-Shanter caps to match
for their costumes, though I hear lhat this year
they are going to be still more gorgeous. As for
the gentlemen—well, I have nothing to do with
their fashions, but I have no doubt they look ex-
tremely beautiful in their sea-side apparel as
beautiful as nature will allow.
Fancy what horrid things they are saying of our
cricketers in England! That they don’t behave
like gentlemen when they are getting the best of
the game, and that they don't seem to realise what
bad form it is to exult over the misfortune of each
antagonistic batsman as be is dismissed Is there
bit erness in these complaints, I wonder? Or is it
that “ our boys ” are really forgetting themselves?
I don’t believe the latter a bit, but I do believe
this—that the English are very, very spiteful.
, Some man has been writing an article in one of
the home papers, advocating the practice of kiss-
ing acquaintances of both sexes when bidding
“ Good-bye,” &c. He says that lips were made for
kissing, and we should not neglect to use them;
but in case every other argument fails to over-
come our scruples, he is mean enough to say that
the girls who object to hissing are eithe*’
too prudish or too painted. Now, I don’t
know how you feel about it, but 1 think I should
just bate a man wbo could writ© such dreadful
things of U8—SO cowardly and far-fetched I Why,
he simply spoils his own cause hy giving publicity
to such ungallant, not to say stupid, idpas. How
many of us are there who wouldn’t willingly stand
the odium of being dubbed either painted or
prudish rather that kiss every man, or, what is
worse, every woman, of our acquaintance ? There
is only sting whei’e the cap fits.
Here comes my faithful Kniehtwith bouquets for
to-night’s concert, and, oh! ihev look so lovely, I
really must leave off in order to indulge him with
half-an-hour’a email talk as a reward for his
thoughtful generosity.
Addic, addlo.
yours ever.

A MEMORY.
The heart of Zachary Barry is sore within
him, and will not be comforted, because the Vic-
torian Banner Is no more. The cause of Us
death he gives unconsciously in one phrase: it
took the same platform as the Protestant Stan-
dard.” We remember the birth of the Banner:
it flickered into the world as feebly as it flickered
out. We were at lhat time engaged in waking to
ecstasy the living lyre'of a suburban paper, which
was largely patronised by personsof literary tastes
—in the trunk-making line. It was not a very
lucrative occupation, but it was great fun, for all
that. Ah I we were gay young dogs in those days
(only four years ago— whisky and chicken-hazard
age a man very fast), and little thought the wmra
of life would turn so soon to vinegar. But this is
weakness; let ua proceed. The paper came out
only once a week, so that our task was compara-
tively light. After the Council-meetings were re-
ported in full—they had to be reported in full
because most of the aldermen were advertisers,
and if one saw his speeches were cut down he
- would immediately withdraw his advertisement —
there was only the leading-article to come, which
the proprietor always wrote himself—under per-
petual protest, however —and we had to fill in the
rest of the paper. The proprietor was a hearty
old gentleman, with white hair and a face like the
rising sun, only redder, and a laugh like a jocular
thunder-clap. He belonged to the good old school
of editors, who had to be locked up before they
would put pen to paper. His delight was to slide
out when we were not watching and sail down
town to see his political friends, who were many,
and talk over the situation. There is always
a “situation” in Victorian politics. It was a
highly interesting sight to see him standing in
the midst of a group of stout old gentlemen—very
podgy pillars of the State, indeed—haranguing
them upon the burning question of the time, and
emphasising his remarks by poundingjon the pave-
ment with a stick which had a ferule as big as a
horse-shoe. A very hearty old gentleman, indeed.
All this time we would be in the upper room at the
office, spinning out stanzas to Delias, Lesbias, Zoes,
and Chloes, under cover of which classical names
it was our pleasant fancy to make amatory ad-
dresses to the Marias, Maggies, Mary Janes, and
Julia Anns of our acquaintance—addresses which,
now r hat we are comfortably married into a board-
ing house business, we have no hesitation in ad-
mitting were generally received with a coldness
bordering on apathy. Generally, but not invari-
ably. There was the rosy-cheeked daughter of
the butcher over the way, who used to peep slyly
at us through links of sausages, and who, when
our signals became too demonstrative, would hide
herself behind a hind-leg of mutton, or shyly
retreat into the shade of a ham. Ah, little rosy-
cheeked butoheress, who throws kisses at you
now ?—who watches to see your round arm grace-
fully stretched to cut down a “ pound of that?”—
who wakes in the morning from a dream of those
lips of yours redder than the juiciest steak ? Who ?
Perhaps the Flying Pieman. Eheu! So, one by
one, our romances tado away from us on the dusty
ways of life. Not soon shall we forgot thee, O
little soft-eyed maid of the meat-mart I Not
soon, either, shall we forget thy bluff and
honest old father, who, when he discovered the
correspondence which we used to carry on
across the street by telephone-an ingenious ar-
rangement of jam-tins and twine, the fruit
of our own invention—came across with a
carving-knife in one hand and a meat-saw
in the other to procure information with regard
to the nature of our intentions. An illiterate old
gentleman was he, or he would have known that
Hell is paved with such intentions as those with
which he went away satisfied. But Jet us draw a
veil over these memories. They belong to the
past—to the days that are no more. Yet have we
one consolation in knowing that we have lived not
all in vain, and that if we missed a butchery we
made sure of a boarding-house. Well, it was a
good time we had then, though we thought but
little of it. Ah, ces beauxjeurs quandj’etais si mal-
heureux! When we were not writing love-lyrics,
we were embellishing police-reports, or eulogising
the enterprise of some new advertiser, who had
opened a green-grocery in our midst with a stock
of half-a-dozen withered cabbages, a sack of spike-
eyed potatoes, a few bunches of wizened celery,
and a small assortment of other aged vegetables.
In this we saw an evidence of dash and spirit
which we were sure our readers would accept as
another overwhelming proof of the flourishing
condition of our suburb, and its attraction for
capitalists as a Held for commercial speculation.
After wnting this, we would drop in casually on
the green-grocer, and see how it had affected him.
It rarely affected him to a pitch of enthusiasm that
might not bo measured by mangel-wurzels, or, if
we preferred them, onions. We generally pre-
ferred onions, as we were fond of onions in those
days. Onions and rum. Now we care no longer for
onions. There was with us as co-editor and co-
labourer in the ways that were dark and the tricks
that were vain, a gentleman from Tipperary, with
a small moustache and a generous smile—one of
whose many affable caprices it was to get up in the
middle of the night and practice upon an unholy
Instrument he called a trombone. Ho was a sort
of demoniac somnambulist, but the devil always
left him in the morning. It was a theory of the
editor’s son—one of the most cheerful fellows we
ever met, and one of the most striking Images
of the “ Knight of the Kueful Countenance ”
— that our Tipperary confrere was punished
in this way at night for the liras he told
during the day. And he certainly told lies
enough to justify the supposition. Speaking of
the editor's son, reminds us that whenever he
took a religious tit, which he did occasionally, it I
invariably wound up with a seraphic spree. His
intoxication then took the form of Lara-like gloom
and Satanic obstinacy. He would coil himself
round the crank of the press and defy his Creator
in a manner that shocked even us. On these
occasions we could only disengage him with a
crow-bar and get him to bed with a windlass. But
he was a most estimable young man when not in
his hiccups—so we didn’t much mind the trouble.
Thunder! We have almost forgotten the Banner,
which perhaps matters the less, as we suppose few
remember it by this time—except the shareholders.
It is a strange thing, is it not, how a mere word—
the mention of a name—will call up the ghosts of
the past from the deep Hades of the brain ? There
is no statute of limitation to lay them. Well, when
the Banner was started, two whlte-chokered and
bilious-eyed gentlemen of the Rev. Aaron Yollop
type came to the olfleo every day to write it. They
sat in the upper room at the same table with us.
As a consequence, blasphemy would be rife at one
end and piety at the other. To do ourselves and
our Tipperary friend justice, we must say that the
balance was generally on the side of blasphemy.
Of course we were decorous enough to utter our
profanities under a whisper, but they were ail the
deeper for this enforced repression. It is needless
to say that our opinions were the exact opposite
of those held by the reverend gentlemen. Anyone
looking at the table above might have seen some-
thing like this written on a slip at one end: “ His
Holiness the Pope is, we hear with profound regret,
in a very feeble state of health. The faithful will
join together in praying the Almighty to spare to
the Church the life of one of the most saintly of
the long line of saintly characters who have filled
the chair of St. Peter.” At the other end jhe
would have read something after this fashion;—
“ The beginning of the end is at hand. Antichrist
is at his last gasp. The Man of Sin totters on his
throne. The Beast with the Seven Heads is dying
in his lair The Pope of Rome is perishing by
inches in the heart of his palace. The true fol-
lowers of Christ, who defy the devil and all his
works and dance upon the nootrine of Rome, will,
we know, join together in thanking the Almighty
for thus visiting with His wrath one of the most
crafty, unscrupulous, and impious tyrants that
have ever disgraced a position that has been dis-
graced since tne beginning.” In the intervals of
writing, wo used to send out the beer-jug. The
clerical scribes looked coldly upon this custom at
first; but one day when our triend, in a burst of
Tipperary generosity, asked one of them to take
a glass ot beer, he replied that “the day was hot,
and he thought he would.” And he did. And the
others did. Then two jugs used to go out regu-
larly. and the Banner gained much thereby. But
the post is going. (N.B.—We live out of town,)
Well, all we have to say in conclusion is, that we
think the Banner was ruined by drink. The
editors couldn’t stand it. And it is our great glory
to think that we led them astray.
Some ferocious sentences were passed last
Devon Quarter Sessions. Five prisoners were
sentenced in the aggregate to thirty-live years’
penal servitude for such comparatively trifling
offences as stealing respectively two ducks, four
bullocks, seven fowls, an apron, and three small
pieces of jewellery.
M. Pasteur’s experiments with the virus
of hydrophobia are going on with unbroken suc-
cess. He has thus far experimented on 57 dogs,
19 of them mad, and 38 bitten by them under
uniform conditions. Out of these 38, half had been
previously innoculated, the other half not. The
latter, without a single exception, died with un-
mistakeable signs of hydrophobia, whereas the 19
others are about and as well as ever.
At a menagerie at Wrexham, Wales, a
keeper playfully tapped Nero, a lion, on the nose.
Nero resented the familiarity by at once seizing
the hand of the attendant, who endeavoured by
terms of endearment to make the animal let go.
Instead of doing so however, Nero placed one of
bis immense paws upon the imprisoned arm, and,
seizing it nearer the elbow with his jaws, he vio-
lently dragged the arm further through the bars,
and with a jerk bit or tore the limb in twain close
to the elbow joint, and then greedily devoured
that portion of the arm and hand he had thus ob-
tained possession of. However, the keeper will
recover.
It was nothing but proper that the Queen
should confer the Garter upon the boy Prince
Georg© of Wales, seeing that It is an Order that
has long ceased to be a distinction worthy of a
man’s acceptance. Like the Order of St. Michael
the Archangel, instituted by Louis XI. of France,
which came to be so indiscriminately conferred
that it got nicknamed “ Collier a toutes hetes," the
Garter will soon come to be known as the “De-
coration for any high-born Inincompoop.” The
only thing to be really feared, is lest some day a
man who has rendered great services to the coun-
try should be Insulted with the offer of enrolment
in the most noble company of gartered faineants.
That would be too bad.
Marino, the Italian carabineer, shot for
murdering an officer, after conviction became so
prostrate that it was thought he would die before
execution. When led up to the fatal chair, he
threw himself down and screamed, half unoonoious
from fright, while convulsively shuddering. Ap-
parently he derived but little comfort from the
unremitting consolations of the priest. Upwards of
5000 spectators went to the place of execution ns if
to a race. Marino fell instantaneously, two balls
piercing the brain and six the lungs and heart.
Immediately after the removal of the body the
people rushed to dip their handkerchiefs in the
blood. A medical student took possession of some
of the scattered brains.
The molly-goodie who serves up the Cun-
dletonnews for the Manning River Tract says,
with what he Intends for withering sarcasm:—
“We are now blest with billiard and bagatelle
tables in the town, and last but not least, a skittle
alley to improve the minds and morals of our young
men. Our Licensing Bench seem determined to
give ample scope for pleasure seekers. Of course,
no gambling will be allowed in the above places.’"
And why not a skittle alley? Does the M. R.
Tract’s “ own correspondent ” think because he
is virtuous there shall be no more beer and skittles?
A good square game at skittles is a healthy amuse-
ment, and if the exercise induce a craving for a
modest quencher, what for no? Hang all hypo-
critical Puritanism.
The Bathurst Free Press thus poses im-
partially anent the gate-money riot:—“That the
Australian team as a whole Intended to fight for
money, quite as much as for honour and glory, no
one can doubt, and they may have shown a greed
that was distasteful and reprehensible, but the
Britions (sic) should have punished them for any
wrong-doing in a manner more dignified and more
in keeping with the character for ‘bonnie play’
which they have hitherto enjoyed. After this
occurrence, it is plainly to be seen that it is neces-
sary for even Britons to be reminded
‘ That of the great, neglecting to bo just.
Heaven in a moment makes a heap of dust.’ ”
Which reminds us, somehow, of the story of the
husband, who, when a fierce Algerine sunstroke
smote his wife in a moment into a heap of calcined
dust on the floor of his verandah, rang for his ser-
vant and told him to bring him another “ B. and S,”
and sweep up his missis.
The world makes few graver mistaken than
in supposing a man must necessarily possess all the
cardinal virtues because he has a big dog and
several dirty children. We know a butcher whose
children are not merely dirty—they are fearfully
and wonderfully besmirched by the hand of an
artist. He has, in addition, a big dog with a bias
towards dropsy, who flies at you across the street
with such celerity that he outruns his bark by a
full second, and you are aware of your danger
only after his teeth are buried in your leg. And
yet the father of these children and the owner of
this dog is no whit better, to all appearance, than
a baker who has clean brats ana a mild poodle. He
is not even a good butcher; he hacks a ribs and
lacerates a sirloin. He talks through his nose,
which turns up to such an extent that his voice
passes right over your bead, and you have to get
on a table to tell whether he Is slandering his dead
mother or swearing at yourself. If that man
possessed a thousand young ones, exaltedly nasty,
and dogs enough to form a sub-Atlantic cable of
German sausage, you would find it difficult to
make us believe in him. In fact, we look upon the
big dog test of morality as a venerable mistake-
natural but erroneous; and we regard the dirty
children as indispensable in no other sense than
that they are inevitable.
Did we eat one another There is no
doubt about it. The unwelcome truth has long
been suppressed by Interested parties, who find
their account in playing sycophant to that self-
satisfied tyrant, Modern Man; but to the impartial
philosopher it is as plain as the nose upon an
elephant’s face that our ancestors ate one another.
The custom of the Fiji Islanders, which is their
only stock-in-trade, their only claim to notoriety,
is a relic of barbarism; but it is a relic of our bar-
barism. Man is naturally a carnivorous animal.
This, none but green-grocers will dispute. That
he was formerly less vegetarian in his diet than at
f (resent, is clear from the fact that market-garden-
ng increases in the ratio of civilisation. 80 we
may safely assume that at some remote period
man subsisted upon an exclusively flesh diet. Our
uniform vanity has given us the human mind as
the lie plus ultra of intelligence, the human face
and figure as the standard of beauty. Of course, we
cannot deny to human fat and lean an even greater
superiority over beef, mutton, and pork. It is
fdain that our meat-eating ancestors would think
n this way, and, being unrestrained by the mawk-
ish sentiment attendant upon high civilisation,
would act habitually upon the obvious suggestion.
A priori, therefore, it is clear that wo ate our-
selves. Philology is about the only thread which
connects us with the prehistoric past. By picking
up and piecing out the scittered remnants of our
language, we form a patchwork of wondrous de-
sign. Oblige us by considering the derivation of
the word “ sarcophagus,” and see if it be not sug-
gestive of potted meats. Observe the significance
of the phrase “ sweet sixteen.” What a world of
meaning lurks in the expression “ she is sweet as a
peach,” and how suggestive of luncheon are the
words “tender youth.” A kiss itself is but a
modified bite, and when a girl insists upon making
a “strawberry mark ” upon the back of your hand
she only gives way to an instinct she has not yet
learned to control. The fond mother, when she
says her babe is almost “good enough to eat,” 1
merely shows that she herself is only a trifle too
refined to eat it. These evidencesjmight be multi-
plied ad infinitum; but if enough has been said to
Induce one human being to revert to the diet of i
his ancestors, the object of this paragraph is ac-
complished.
Touching that colossal American statoo of
“Liberty enlightening the World,” of which we
so lucidly, so learnedly, so exhaustively, so—[Here,
this isn’t the Down and Gumtrke Jernil.—Ed.
B.] —well, anyway, to which we alluded in a recent
issue, it appears that there is a big hitch just at
present over the erection of a pedestal. Herein
lies the difference between the Amurrikuns and
ourselves. We erect a pedestal first, and then go
nosing about afterwards to find a statue that will
fit it; the Amurrikuns first catch their statue, and
then hang out subscription-lists to buy a pedestal.
The amount required to erect a foundation for the
great Bartholdi statue is over a quarter of a mil-
lion, and the amount scooped in up to the present
date is only a paltry one hundred thousand dollars.
This statoo, by the way, is the gift of the French
nation to America in commemoration of some-
thing or another that no one remembers anything
at all of now, and the people of New York are
lamenting that a six-barrelled earthquake didn’t
swamp La Belle France the moment she first
thought of making such a present. Luckily, how-
ever. the spirit of enterprise promises to pull the
New Yorkers through, and the proprietors of a
patent medicine have benevolently offered to do-
nate J#5,000 to the fund provided they be allowed
to place upon the base of the pedestal the word
“Castoria in job-type letters, the said word to
remain in situ for one year. This happy thought
has opened up a whole world of similar ideas, and
it is now reckoned that instead of being a white
elephant to the State, Bartholdi’s great statue will
prove to be a most important source of revenue.
For example,providing the “Castoria” genius is
allowed to decorate the pedestal with his Inspired
ad., announcements touching Mother Buncombe’s
eye-water could be plastered over the colossal eye-
lids for 25,000 dollars per annum also; tooth-
powder and neuralgic cures could be tatooed
round its jaws; chest protectors could cover the
breast; liver pads could be hung in festoons lower
down; coim and bunion removers might decorate
its feet, whilst round the flowing folds of the
drapery could be carved the dread legends, “ What
is this disease that is coming upon us? Like a
thief at night it steals in upon us unawares.”
“ Down again. Try our seven-and-sixpenny pants.”
“ Ask your bootmaker for Clump’s patent boot-
protectors, and be sure you get the right brand.”
And as we don’t exactly see why America should
have the sole monopoly of this brilliant idea, we
respectfully suggest that R. B. Smith form, him-
self into a select committee to deal by that lump
of granite at top of King-street even as the New
Yorkers are about to deal with the 141-ft. effigy of
Bartholdi’s champion goddess.
History repeats itself simply because hu-
man nature is the same yesterday, to-day, and to-
morrow week. As it was in the beginning, so will
it be in sec via scculorwn, tg wit, that the army
contractor shall be a damned rogue and the com
missary official his aider and abettor. During the
Egyptian campaign, as of old in Marlborough’s
time and Raglan’s time, there was muddle and
worse than muddle—brickbats served as forage to
the charger, musty bread served as rations to Mr
Thomas Atkins, delay, peculation, waste—the re.’
suit of it all being a K.C.B.-ship to the commissary
and a fortune tor the contractor; while for Mr
Atkins it meant the thorough undermining of his
constitution, and the pleasant prospect of a year
or so on a pension of sixpence a day, arid the rat-
tling of his pauper bones over the stones from the
workhouse to the cemetery. “ Only the other dav
(says a London paper) wo read of a man who was
wounded at the Redan receiving 6d. a day for two
Sears, and at last dying in a workhouse. Now we
ave a survivor of the famous charge of Balaclava
dying in a County Hospital, his pension of six-
Sence per diem having lasted only two years after
e left the army.” Yes, it’s everlastingly true that
Tommy Atkins is
“—Jest the grist thet’s put into War s hoppers
Leftenants is the lowest grade that helps pick un
the coppers; H
The Ginerals git the biggest sheer, the cunnles
next, and so on,
Tom never gets a blasted mite of glory ez we know
on.”
In days when the rights of Chairmen are
questioned, and the Lord knows what powers mav
be claimed for a Speaker, it is a juicy thing to
know that Adelong is alive to the situation
Patriotically do we immortalise Mr. Spencer Groves
of Tumut.and reluctantly do we forego any allusion
to Herbert of that ilk who now writes in the Con-
temporary. We’ll oven be more learnedly gener-
ous for once, and say nothing of Grove’s Correla-
tion of Physical Forces, but, just for the sake of
Tpby (Punch being dead), quote him in full
Listen, Taylor, and fancy a Chairman like this in'
the turbulent halls of Adelong while you can
barely get a hearing in Maequarie-strect;—“ a
Model Chairman: \t the excited meetings re-
cently held at the Royal Hotel for the purpose of
nominating a new progress committee, Mr. Ken-
dall, as chairman, certainly proved himself the
right man in the right place. The remarkable pa-
tience, rare tact, and judicious firmness, coupled
with the most courteous demeanour, which he dis-
played in the discharge of his onerous duties, won
for him not only the hearty thanks of the respec-
tive meetings over which presided, but the warm
respect of the whole community.”
Competition among English dentists is
now so keen that you can buy half a set of teeth
for £1 Is. In many dentists’ windows you see
placards calling your attention to “Our Guinea
Jaw Which reminds one that an animal, known
in commercial circles as “ The Guinea Pig.” is at
present overwhelmingly plentiful, and that, in
floating a company, you can. for a consideration
be enabled to place on your advertised list of
directors titled individuals, the mere mention of
whose names is sufficient to extract money from
the pockets of those who love a lord. The English
“Guinea-pig” is a person very different from the
Sydney Guinea-pig.” In Sydney about 10.45 a.m
you see silvery-haired, fresh-coloured, well-shaved
old boys, in black coats and carefully toned white
waistcoats, either wending their way across Hyde
Park on toot or being driven down town by grimy
servants in antediluvian shandrydans, “ to attend
the board meeting.” These old fellows, though
they grasp up all the directors’ fees, aren’t in abso-
lute want of them. They are disgustingly rich,
and they attend board meetings because they are
largely Interested in bank stock, and like to look
after their own investments. In England, lords
dukes, and even princes, become “Guinea-pigs”’
because they are hard up. So many of the nobility
are hard up, that there was more than a mere spice
of truth in the observation which a satirical paper
the other day put into the mouth of a title-hunt-
ing heiress, who remarked that a certain nobleman
‘was pretty rich—for a lord.” Very recently
the writer became aware of a case in
which a man who thought about floating a piece
of pastoral property was told by a go-between
that he could have the Duke of on the board
for £1000, and that an introduction to Prince
would cost 500 guineas.” The Duke, it was added,
would for that sum go on the board for certain—
that could be guaranteed-but ’twould be neces-
sary for the squatter, in dealing with the Prince, to
pay down £525, and take his chance as to whether
or not he’d have to fork out an additional £1000 or
so on account of His Royal Highness. Some very
eminent “Guinea-pigs ” of high rank in the aristo-
cracy have played out their little game to such an
extent that the mere mention of their names in
connection with a financial enterprise is sufficient
to provoke the eloquent expressions, “Phewl
Ouf!” But, to return to the dentists. When the
face has fallen in, owing to the jaw having long
been toothless, these gentry remove the depression
by moans of india-rubber springs, which are both
technically and commonly known as “ plumpers.”
Everything is false now-a-days. Bracelets are
often as hollow as the hearts of those who wear
them. Hair, teeth, embonpoint, tournure, are all
frauds; so that the female form divine is a thing
Which owes its charms unto the arts
Of Worth or David Jones,
Who, to deceive the guileless swain.
Too oft do deck mere bones,
And fleshless maids with waspish waists,
Sylphs’ figures freely give—
Maids tar too seraph-like for earth,
Because too thin to live.
Matters were bad enough when, in kissing your
girl, you had to do it gingerly because of the
rouge. They were bad enough when, after Kissing
her, you were debarred from smacking your own
lips, because she might think you were enjoying,
not the abstract kiss, but the more concrete gly-
cerine. Once upon a time, the breath of Evan-
geline was “ sweet as the breath of kine that feed
in the meadows.” Now, the breath of the maiden
of Grand Pre is redolent of Plorida-water or
“ cachou aromatise.” Once the lovely tremulous
elasticity of Belinda’s cheek was due to springy
muscles, to bounding arteries, and an unstained
skin. To-day, or rather to-night, she proceeds to
lock the door and soak her grinders in a tumbler
of water ten minutes after she has presented for
the vespernal salutation of poor trusting Reginald
at the front gate a cheek which derives its interest-
ing pallor from rice-powder, and its rotundity
from india-rubber “plumpers.”
WONDERS OF THE AGE.
Why is it so many people are never satisfied ?
Their homes are marvels of comfort and luxury
friends are generous and affectionate ; they are
educated and refined, capable, not only of enjoy-
ing, but of imparting happiness to others ; yet
they are dissatisfied, miserable, and, really without
intending to do so, make others miserable. Their
blood is impure, they have taken a heavy cold, or
they are bilious. A few doses of Emil Frese’s
Hamburg Tea would remove all obstructions, and
enable them to enjoy, with renewed zest, the plea-
sures they are now compelled to forego.
FOR THE GUIDANCE OF OTHERS.
Glenmore Road, Paddington,
_ 14th January, 1884.
Gentlemen,—Some few weeks since I was so
severely affected with indigestion as to render my
rising each morning a matter of difficulty and
pain on account of severe pains in the back; and
it had just become necessary for me to take a holi-
day from my work, for the performance of which
I was by no means lit, when a friend mentioned to
me the benefit he derived from the use of Ham-
burg Tea. In the hope of getting some relief, I
used it myself, the result being that I was myself
in three or four days, and have not suffered since.
My friends have advised me to write this for the
guidance of others, and you are at liberty to make
what use you please of this.
Yours,
JOHN KELLY.

AFTER THREE MONTHS’ use of Cuticuba
Remedies, and twelve years of as constant
suffering from Humor of the face, neck and scalp
as was ever endured, I can say that I am cured,
and pronounce my case the most remarkable on

I have stopped men on the street who were afflicted
and told them to get the Cuticuba Remedies
and they would cure them. This is why I am so
grateful to you, for I believe them to be the best

“ Gents: I
have never before given

willing to encourage the use
of an honest remedy. I am
so pleased with your Hair Brush
that I deem It my duty to write
you recommending It most cordial-
ly. My hair, about a year since, com

coming bald; but since using the Brush a thick
growth of hair has made its appearance, quite
equal to that which I had previous to Its falling out. I
have tried other remedies, but with no success. After this
remarkable result I purchased one for my wife, who has been
a great sufferer from headache, and she finds it a prompt and
infallible remedy. A. C. Bridgeman,D.D

Madame Bayabd, 7 Southampton street, , writes: —
_ . , , _ , October 2,18*2.
Before going to bed, as much for the sake of health as of beauty, it is only right to* ai tend to several little things of the toilet; well brush the hair;
abstain from using pomade, as it sometimes proves injur ious to hair which is already too greasy, while it soils the linen of the bed, and gives a dirty
look to inside of the hat, and if ladies would but freely use Dr. Scott’s Electric Hair Brush, night and morning, the most stnbborn hair can be
rendered smooth and glossy, beautiful, soft, and agreeable, while the Brush will also assist its growth, and remove scurf.
Dr. NirseojLSON PiiiCK, M.B.G.S., Moont Pleasant, Deeds, writes: — A patient of mine has been using Dr. Electric Hair Brush, she having

be glad if you would send me one.

NEVER previously did any piano win such a I old

Its introduction Our competitors have no doubt
done their level best to rival ua—blazoning forth
their bald imitations with a tremendous flourish
of trumpets. What result have they to show,
excepting 1 to point to the gradual death of all their
offspring? The reason is soon found. Inferior
instruments, with showy exteriors, have been
brought forth and attempted to bo foisted on the
public. But the right-thinking public will have
none of them. The consequence is that the
Sales of the Mignon Piano
have Trebled.
THE MIGNON PIANO
Has tbilnd its way Into every town almost of all
the colonies-in Victoria aha New South Wales,
from north to south ; to the far north of Queens-
land ; in Now Zealand, from one end to the other
of the islands. In South Australia and Tasmania
THE MIGNON
can be found, and its name is really a household
word.
THE MIGNON PIANO
is the people’s favourite,
THE MIGNON PIANO
for its size defies all would-be Imitations.
THE MIGNON PIANO
is guaranteed to withstand any climate in Australia.
THE MIGNON PIANO
is the cheapest, because the best.
THE MIGNON PIANO
can be hadHon very easy TIME PAYMENT.
THE MIGNON PIANO
excels all similar pianos for first-class work and
richness of tone.

Hair Vigor
fesidfes, With the gloss and freshness of
youth, faded or gray hair to a natural, rich
broWn color, or deep bhtek, as may he desired.
By its iVse' light or fed hair Way he darkened,
thin hair thickened, and baldness Often 1 ,■
though not always, cured.
U checks falling of the hail 1 , and sthim-
rate? a weak and sickly grovvtli to vigo:*; It
fire vents and cures scurf a’lid dandruff, am.
Keall nearly every disease peculiar to the
«?c'alp. As a Ladies’ Hair Dressing, the
Vigor is unequalled ; it contains neither oil
nor dye, renders the hair soft, glossy, and
Silken in appearance, and imparts a delicate,
agreeable, and lasting perfume.
, IiTr. CV Pi B RICHER writes from Kirby, (>..
July ;i, 1882: “ Last fall my hhir commenced'
falling out, and in a short time 1 became
nearly bald. 1 used part of a battle of
Aver’8 Hair Vigor, which stopped the falL
iug ot the hair, aud started a new growth,
have now a full head of hair growing vigor-
ously, and am convinced that but tor the
use of your preparation I should have been
tetirely’bald.”
S: $t. So'wEX, proprietor of the McArthur
( Ohio) Enquirer, says : “Ayer's Hair Vigor
is a most excellent preparation for the hair.
1 speak of it from my own experience. Its
use promotes the growth of new hair, and
makes it glossy and soft. The Vigor is also
a sure cure for dandruff. Not within my
knowledge has the preparation ever failed
to give entire satisfaction.”
Mr. Angus Fairbairn, leader of the
celebrated “ Fairbairn Family ” of Scottish
Vocalists, writes from Boston, Mass., Feb. 6,
1880 : “Ever since my hair began to give sil-
very evidence of the change which fleeting
time procureth, I have used Ayer's Hair
Vigor, and so have been able to maintain
an appearance of youthfuluess — a matter of
considerable consequence to ministers, ora-
tors, actors, and in fact every one who lives
in the eyes of the public.”
Mrs. O. A, Prescott, writing frem 18 Elm
fit., Charlestown , Mass., April 14. 188:2, says :
n Twd yefftrif ago about two-thirds of my hair
came off. It thiiUfed very rapidly, and I Was
fast growing bald. On using Ay Ell’s Hair
Vigor the falling stopped and a new gfoWtli
commenced, and in about a month my head
was completely covered with short hair. It
has continued to grow, and is now as good as
before it fell. I regularly used but one bottle
of the Vigor, hut now use it occasionally as
a dressing.”
We have hundreds of similar testimonials

cal ot US Vatltle;

the coffins in the window. If we P+hfra'nn

too long to black-lead the leaders. P e
with the utmost good humour; and, ** that
moment, the Coogee tram stopping, handed her
in. “Ah,” she said, when seated, this is very
pleasant, even luxurious. There’s a navvy In the
other corner, and an old woman, with two red
herrings in a paper, opposite. Ah, here comes a
boy eating bread-and-treacle. I suppose a do#
get y In directly. What a good thing I refused a
seat on Captain M‘Musket's drag for this delight-
ful entertainment.” During this harangue all he
did was to stroke his long yellow moustache, show
his white teeth, and, unavailingly, endeavour to
start the usual small talk. Nearing Kandwlck, he
produced a bag of tarts. “ Have one, hesaid
**1 can’t afford, she replied, glancing at
her gauntlet gloves, “to pay los. 6d. tor
a penny tart.” “I am sorry,’ he remarked
(eating one), “that you wont have some, for
I went a long way down George-street to get
them fresh.” ‘ I see you spare no expense,
she said, hysterically. ‘ No, he , replied, after
consideration: ’‘I’m pretty liberal, take me all
round.” She gave a slight groan, after which
there was a long pause. At length she said, in a
kind of desperation—” How are we going back i
“By the ’Inis,” he said, with a smile. Then she
squeezed herself up in her corner and said no
more. Arrivedjat the hotel, he called for brandy-
and-water and a cigar for himselt, and the sherry
of tho country for the lady. He then commanded
that within three-quarters of an hour be served
steak and fried potatoes and bottled porter.
«stay! don’t go, waiter,” cried the lady, as he was
departing: “is there such a thing as tripe in the
house ? ’’ “No, Miss,” replied the waiter; we ve
no call for tripe here.” “No cow-heel, either,
waiter?” “No, Miss.” “I’m sorry for that, was
the smiling rejoinder, “ because when I come out
with a gentleman ” (great emphasis “he usually
calls for tripe and cow-heel. That will do, waiter.
“Thank you, Miss,” and he went out with a puz-
Bled air. A walk before the banquet did not very
much improve things, though she could not help
noticing that he looked very picturesque as they
walked along the cliff. The dinner was little
more of a success than the walk. The gentle-
man ate grilled steak and drank bottled porter
with an air of great enjoyment; while the
lady, declining steak, crumbled a piece of bread,
and ostentatiously rang the bell tor a glass of
water. This the waiter brought up with the cheese
and celerv, and the lady was rather surprised that
the servant dl l not cast scornful looks at her com-
panion, who commenced on those viands imme-
diately. The gentleman wound up by a terrific
draught of porter out of a large glass mug; then,
wiping his lips on his napkin, smacked them with
an air of great enjoyment, Now, Miss Zoe, said
he. rising; “ come along.” “ Bu^but— thei bill,
she faltered. “ Oh. never mind the bill, said he.
She sank into a chair. “ He has no money to pay
It.” she sobbed; “ oh. why did I ever come t Then,
fearful of being held responsible by the waiter.
She tripped hurriedly down after the gentleman.
He was watching for her (suspicious circumstance)
at some distance from the hotel. “ Sit down, he
said, almost roughly, pointing to a seat; I have
something to say to you.” She made a feint of
saying that she would go on Sunday afternoon and
hear him in the Domain, but somehow there was
no ring in the sarcasm. “Now, listen,” he said;
“ you belong to a silly class of young women who
live simply for effect. You would like to hkve had
tough fowl which you could not have digested,
and bad champagne which would have made you
Blok, instead of what I ordered—simply for effect.
You would have preferred a buggy and pair along
the shrieking tram-line-slmply for effect;i you
would have liked me to have made myself ridicu-
lous by a lot of meaningless attentions—simply
for effect. All this, my dear, is hollow. I could
have brought you down in a buggy and pair; I
could have given you a barn-yard fud of fowls,
and you could have swum in champagne, had I
chosen. But I did not. I wished merely to dis-
cover if there were a sensible, straightforward,
honest girl in your paste-board and watch-metal
world. I find there is not. You do not know my
right name. There it Is, on my card. My carriage
Is yonder. It waits to take you to Sydney. Good-
bye. I am going back by the’bus.” Saylngwhich,
he raised his hat very slightly, and strolled a,way.
When he had gone, she glanced at the card. It
■was that of one of the richest men in Australia!
Then upon the Spring breezes there floated, in a
rhythmic cadence, the words—
“Missed him I D
Trade was brisk on the trains on Saturday
morn, and the Redfern platform v*as thronged
■with a very mixed assortment of passengers, when
a lady who looked like the cnaste Susanna’s maiden
aunt came tripping along, leading a poodle that
was of the female persuasion, and in a decidedly
interesting way, indeed. Calling one of the porters
—a verdant new-chum—one side, the lady begged
him in a whisper to purchase a ticket for her four-
legged companion; bur the porter, after running
here and there confusedly, managed to get back
just as the train was about to start, and told his
fair customer of the disappointment. Noticing
that Johnny-come-lately had a kindly face, th?
lady smilingly observed, “ It's too late now: but if
You like, I’ll make you a present of my poor dead
Mora. Be kind to her, sir. for my sake.” Then
Bhe stepped into a car full of fashionables; the
train moved on, and the grateful porter, hanging
onto the step, roared out, “Begorra, mam, Oi 11
luk afthur her jhist az if she was th’ turst lady in
th’ land. And luk here, ma’am, ye’ll not go short,
alther, for Ol'll send you a pup as soon as iver she
has wan.” And all this time, Mora's former owner
looked indignantly at her fellow-passengers, and
■wondered wnoever that horrid, low man could be
addressing. As if she didn’t know, you know.
Little Bailey has a friend—one solitary

feel when Bailey left that he hired a black boy
named Tommy, a fresh-run Myall, to sit out in the
bach -yard with him on a log and pitch circus-
poster yarns to him just as his gay little bantam
companion used in happy days of yore. This new
Mus Achates was a simple-minded child of Nature,
but bad so far conformed to the usages of polite
society as to consent to wear a cotton shirt and a
pair of moleskin breeches, both articles being at
the time of his engagement about seventeen
shades darker in hue than their dusky owner.
Not being aware of the limited nature of the
heathen's wardrobe, the mistress of the house
ordered him to take his shirt and pants into the
kitchen «nd tell Bridget, the general utility lady,
to have them washed immediately, A few minutes
after this there came a succession of shrieks and
yells from the back premises that would have
scared the soul out of one of the mummied
Pharoahs, and on rushing out to ascertain the
cause, the stark naked form of Tommy was seen
shinning over the fence while Bridget accelerated
his movements with the business end of a ciothes-
nron Finally, the lord of the soil got clear, and
then turning round, the indignant slavey ex-
claimed, "Oh, holy Vargin, mam! but its nairly
dead wid th’ freight I am, fur that baste av a nay-
tur ioosht walked inter me kitchm wid his bnches

in the creek after dark now, but Bridget declares
she has had the “ pulpertaehln ar the heart ’ ever
pinue that dreadful morning.
“Extensive preparations are being made
in London to receive the cholera,” says a morning
paper; which is pretty nearly as clever as thb re-
mark made, not long since, by an alderman—
“Gentlemen, infestuous disease is riding rampant
through the district,”
Mrs. Amy Barnett, of New Jersey, recently
cut her three babies’ throats and then her own.
She screamed out that the devil had told her to do
it. Then she (we hope gracefully) died. At about
the same time, in London, a postman stole a 55-
note out of a letter. When arrested he stated that
the Lord told him to do it. Both these parties
were members of the Harmy. Mrs. Barnett did
not immediately connect her unfortunate contre-
temps with the tuneful body alluded to, but the
postman distinctly Informed the Judge, that the
“Captain” of his district had told him that if he
didn’t wear the uniform of the Harmy he would
never go to Heaven! He wore it for one night,
and, as a preliminary step to glory, he went to
gaol.
A most lady-like, becoming toilette is here shown, of mauve shot-silk, with a
collar two inches high, made of red velvet, and trimmed with light coffee-coloured
laoe. A small three-cornered kerchief of the lace is put round the neck, the ends of
which disappear under the jabot. The latter is of lace, gathered close several times at
the upper edge, and mounted on a band. At the lower edge, the jabot is gathered
once more, and closed with two rows of lace, put one above the other; small silk
pendants are fastened on the jabot, and trim the edge of the bodice like a fringe.
Th® above shows a pointed velvet bodice, trimmed with a satin pleating, set on
with lace falling over; corresponding lace ornaments the sleeves and slit, which is
about three inches deep. A Moliere fichu, made of lace material, hides the button
close in front, and is adorned at the throat and waist with bows of satin riPPop* TPUl
police, worn ov$r a rich lace skirt, is very effective and stylish.
