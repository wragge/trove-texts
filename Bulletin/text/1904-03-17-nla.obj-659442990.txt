Look on this Picture -and on That
JpORGETFUL of the lessons of history,
ignoring the teachings of science, bent
on gratifying their selfish desires and on
pursuing social advancement, they are
seeking to follow the dictates of a narrow
reasoning, and blindly imagine that, in
raising the standard of their own physical
comfort, they are smoothing the path of
life for themselves and for posterity, while
leaving to others the creation of that
posterity for which they profess to be so

" Follow My Leader."
(AS A GAME FOR ILLUSTRATORS. )
LOOKING through recently, with two or
three fellow-students, a fairly complete
collection of the published work of several
celebrated illustrators, we came to the
conclusion that they—in their comparatively early
work,at all events—had very completely borne out
a statement made by Kipling in a letter, part of
which was published in The Bulletin a few years
baok.
“We all steal from one another,” he wrote,
“it’s part of our business.” Now, although many
famous writers have freely confessed how much
they owe to brother authors, leading illustrators
apparently have been less open about that sort of
thing. After all, though, we must remember that,
in the case of the writers, they speak for them-
selves, whereas of the illustrators we are thinking
of—or two of them at least —those who inter-
viewed them speak for them.
FIG. I.— From Regnault's Animal Studies.
FIG VI.— By Du Maurier, in Punch, March
11, 1865.
There is a well-known passage by R.L.S. in
which he mentions his literary debts; and, by the
way, in Harper’s Magazine (June, 1888) there is
this sentiment from one of R.L.S.’s lettersNo-
body had ever such pains to learn a trade as I
had, but I slogged at it day in and day out, and I
frankly believe (thanks to itty dire industry) I
have done more with smaller gifts than almost
any man of letters in the world.” This same “dire
industry ” is characteristic of the four great illus-
trators we are especially discussing—Chas. Keene,
Linley Sambourne, Phil May, and Raven Hill.
And one takes it that a sentence in an article
about Mozart which appeared in the Sat. Review
lately is exactly applicable to them also: “Mozart
was the most completely original of all the com-
posers, and like all highly original men, he owed
much to his predecessors and contemporaries.”
And again : “ He mastered the technique of Bach,
of Haydn, of Gluck ; and in his glorious passionate
youth set to work to use for his own ends all that
he had learnt.” But why, we-wonder, are illus-
trators, who are as'completely original in their line
as Mozart was in his, so chary about acknowledging
how they have helped themselves by not only
looking at but also closely copying bits in the
wofk of t h e i r predecessors and contemporaries ?
*
Less reticence in the matter might be helpful to
younger workers “ Per-hkps—p’r’aps not ”
it is a difficult question that. Anyway, the
fact remains that Phil May used to talk—accord-
ing to more than one interviewer—of having
studied, but not copied, Caran d’Ache; but a
Sydney barrister, very keen in art matters, has
something to say on this head. His admiration
for May’s work is intense—he watched for it
before the brilliant „ artist’s Bulletin period—
and owns some pencil studies made for
various Bulletin drawings, which are simply
marvellous for their delicacy ; but he is not
blind to the fact that May’s memory was
playing him false when he told Arthur Lawrence
(Idler, Dec., ’96): “ I never, at any time in my
life, sat down—as I am afraid a good many young
fellows do now—to deliberately copy another
man’s work.” On the contrary, this collector’s
natural love of getting at evidence in questions of
this sort has resulted in his being able to point to
a case where May copied Caran d’Ache almost
line for line through a whole series of sketches.
This in 1886.
Six years later we find that splendid pen
draughtsman, Schlittgen—whose work in Flie-
gende Blatter is really a feature of that delightful

ME-UP.
FIG. VII. —By Linley Sambourte, in Punch, March 7, 1868.
little gaper—copying May just as closely. That
is, almost line for line. And we can hardly
suppose that “the bookshelves of Caran d’Ache
heave beneath the weight of English and
American unbound comic papers ” for the sake
of the work in said papers being merely looked at
now and again,

Marys little lamb used—-according to the Scotch
reciter—to follow her about most perseestently,
and it is in that same manner Raven Hill and the
other illustrators in question go to Nature ; but it
would appear they ate at the same time willing to
take help in so doing.
It. reminds one of what W. M. Hunt so insists
on in that splendid little book Talks About Art—
for, with all his constant advice about going to
Nature, we find sentences like this: “Copy
Albert Diirer and Hans Holbein for accuracy and
form. Then draw them from memory, and then
make them apart of yourself.” ... “I’ve told
you over and over again whose works to draw
—Michael Angelo, Raphael, Albert Diirer, Hans
Holbein, Mantegna. Get hold of something of
theirs ; hang it up in your room ; trace it, copy it,
draw it from memory over and over, until you
own it as you own ‘Casabianca’ and ‘Mary had
a little lamb.’ ”
But returning. In an interview (Idler, Sept.
’95) with the late Gleeson White, Raven Hill is
made to say much the same, as to Keene and him-
self, that May affirmed about Caran d’Ache and
himself. On second thoughts, it would probably
have been a case—re copying—of “What, never?
—well, hardly ever,” as warbled by the cap-
tain of H.M.S. Pinafore. And having thus got
round from Art, Music and Literature to
the Drama, perhaps we may add that it

isn’t altogether strange that to some collectors
instances of the kind here illustrated should
remind them of a bit in The Silver King —the
bit Redwood and Hans Phillips used to play so
capitally in the eighties. “ Borrowed the money?”
exclaims Father Xmas. “ Yes,’’ replies Mr.
Henry Carkett. “ Are the judges very rough?”
“Oh, brutal—perticlar to young gents as borrows

MEMORANDA
Notes and Queries remarks that every word or dog has
its day, and this day of fiscal (in England). People
who a year since hardly knew of it now roll it on
their tongues like a confection. “ Not long ago the
female keeper of a registry office informed a customer
that the fiscal conditions of domestic service had en-
tirely changed.” Long, long ago a notorious Australian
embalmed the word in a concise election forecast—
“ More Popery than fiscal.” But he could n’t spell fiscal.
The tendenc3' of Lond. journalism is marked by an (un-
authoritative) announcement that The Daily Chronicle
will presently reduce its price to \d.
Some reproductions of etchings by Chas. Keene, in
Feb. Scribner's, are worth looking at. Spielmann as
critic seems to have uncommon flair, and no measure in
his judgment: his swans are swans, but he insists that
they are phoenixes, and all the time. In The Smart Set
mediocrity is nickel-plated...not heavily enough to de-
ceive. These minor Americans are perfect ladies and
elegant gentleman with a sawdust stuffing ; and even
the writers with a red corpuscle (King Charles has rested
quite a while) like Theodosia Garrison seem tamed to hide
it. “Felix Carmen” (F. D. Sherman) is seen squaring
the rhymer’s circle—
To Ver 1 sing—that is, to Spring
As Latin poets write it —
She comes with mirth and song to earth,
And scatters flowers to light it. . .
So, in these times of vernal rhymes,
I toss this verse to thrill Ver,
With, joy to see how nicely she
Supplies a rhyme for silver !
A large and interesting water-colour, by A. H. Fullwood,
“The Selector’s Home,” is shown in Beard, Watson and
Company’s window, George-street, Sydney. A typical
hut mellows in purple coastal atmosphere, and verisimili-
tude is carried as high as a decoy parrot on a sapling-top.
The result is quietly charming. The picture is being
subscribed for in shares—the winner to be decided bv
lot.
William Watson proses in an Amer. of “ The
State Discouragement of Literature ’’—although he re-
ceives a Govt, pension of 100 L “in consideration of his
merit as a poet.” A bit of his heart on his sleeve :
“ Thoughtful rfeaders, the true lovers of books .. . still
prefer a dignified style [like mine], a style that has breed-
ing'and a pedigree [from Matt. Arnold] ; they are still
content with the great decorum of a long-descended
[from Wordsworth] art ; they have not yet wearied of the
best. .. In regard to poetry especially, they have
the gbod sense to wave away the critic.. . with so little
love of the great old writers that he cannot bear a modern
[like me] who reminds him of them. It is not those
readers who slight the ritual and ceremonial of the muse
[and object to me embracing her in a dress suit and
starched collar]. It is not those who applaud a paraded
contempt for form and accomplishment." In other
words, since the difference between Wordsworth and
myself is rather in my favour, why will people persist in
praising one W. W. and appraising the other?
Some .years ago. an Eng. maga. printed a picture of
N.S.W. Govt/. House stables as Govt. House : and N.S.W.
tamely endured the affront. But in January last, when
The London Argus by mistake printed a picture purport-
ing to represent the Bath Hotel at Felixstowe, and’reall.v
representing somebody’s stables, the proprietor of the
hotel sued for libel and recovered damages.
Herbert Spencer’s will directed that, after cremation,
his ashes should be buried “ without any species of reli-
gious ceremony ” “in the unconsecrated part of the
Highgate cemetery,” where he had purchased a grave—a
proper and consistent protest against funeral mumblings
and mummeries and the prehistoric habit of the patter-
cove.

Dear Sirs, —There is nothing that gives
me greater pleasure than showing or
speaking of the great benefit I have re-
ceived from wearing one of your Belts.
For seventeen years I was a cripple, almost
a burden to my people, and a perfect
misery to myself, in fact I was what you
might call a useless man. I tried a good
many doctors, but got no benefit from
their treatment. My boys subscribed £5
for me and got me to Sydney, where I soon
got the Belt. I wore the Belt pretty regu-
larly for from five to seven hours each day
for about three months. My neighbors, like myself, were more than
surprised at the great good I was receiving from the use of the Belt.
I thank God my footsteps were directed to your Institute, for I am
positively a new man altogether. I remain,
Yours faithfully, CHARLES SHEPHERD.
WE GAN
GIVE YOU
The same Benefits these men and
thousands of others have received.
12 Lofts Avenue,
KEW, VIO.
Dear Sirs, —I must say that your wonder-
ful Belt is my best friend, for you know
when I came to you first I was looking
miserable and worn, but I can now say that
I have worn your Belt for three months
and it has improved me wonderfully. I
eat, sleep, and work better, and I find my
life a pleasure. I find your little book
speaks the truth, as your Belt has cured
me, and I am doing my best to let every-
one of my friends know of my great cure.
As for leaving it off, as you were saying
m
some people do, I have not left my Belt off for one night since I got
it, and Ido not mean to for some time yet. I hope every person
with a Lame Back as I had will take my advice and get one of your
Belts, for they speak for themselves more than anybody can.
Yours etc., A. E. PAGRAM.
You can be made Strong and Vigorous. You can get back Health and Happiness.
WE know that no man remains a weakling or suffers the pains and discomforts of life ; because he wants to ;we are sure that you want to overcome
every indication of early decay that has shown itself on you. We don’t think the man lives who would not like to feel as big and strong as a
Sandow, and we know that if you have a reasonable foundation to build upon we can make you a bigger man than you ever hoped tq be. We
want you to know that—you who can’t believe it, and we want you to have our Book, in which we describe how that we learnt that manly
strength was ONLY ELECTRICITY, and how we learned to restore it ; also we want to tell you the names of some men who will tell that when they
came to us they were physical wrecks, and are now amongst the finest specimens of physical manhood.

Dear Sirs, —I am pleased to let you know
that lam in the best of health. I have not
worn your Belt for about six weeks uow,
and I think lam all riirht. The suspensory
did what you promised, and now I feel a
heat all through my body. I got wet
through, and did not feel the ill-effects
from it that I used to. You may book me
as cured, and the Belt is as good as the
day I got it. I take this opportunity of
thanking you for the great relief you have
given me.
I am, dear Sirs, yours truly,
CHARLES DICKSON.

Dear Sirs, —I have much pleasure in in-
forming you, in answer to your inquiries,
that I am now, after wearing your Iligh-
Grade Belt for two months, completely
cured. My back is quite strong, and the
pains I used to suffer from have entirely
left me. I shall be only too glad to see or
correspond with anyone with reference to
your treatment, as I have been most cour-
teously dealt with since I first put myself
under your care. Again thanking you,
I am, Gentlemen, vours faithfully,

BAD COMPLEXIONS
Dry Thin and Falling Hair and Red
Rough Hands Prevented by
CUTICURA SOAP
MILLIONS use Cuticura Soap, assisted by Cuticura Ointment,
for preserving, purifying, and beautifying the skin, for cleans-
ing the scalp of crusts, scales, and dandruff, and the stopping
of falling hair, for softening, whitening, and soothing red,
rough, and sore hands, for baby rashes, itchings, and chafings, in the
form of baths for annoying irritations and inflammations, or too free
or offensive perspiration, in the form of washes, for ulcerative weak-
nesses, and for many sanative, antiseptic, cleansing purposes which
readily suggest themselves to women, especially mothers, and for all
the purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery. Cuticura Soap com-
bines delicate emollient properties derived from Cuticura Ointment,
the great skin cure, with the purest of cleansing ingredients and
the most refreshing of flower odours. No other medicated soap is to
be compared with it for preserving, purifying, and beautifying the
skin, scalp, hair, and hands. No other foreign or domestic toilet soap,
however expensive, is to be compared with it for all the purposes of
the toilet, bath, and nursery. Thus it combines in One Soap at One
Price, the best skin and complexion soap, and the best toilet and
baby soap in the world.
COMPLETE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL TREATMENT FOR EVERY HUMOUR,
Consisting of Cuticura Soap, to cleanse the skin of crusts *” d
thickened cuticle; Cuticura Ointment, to Instantly allay Itching, inflammation, and
Irritation, and soothe and heal; and Cuticura Resolvent pills, to cool and cleanse the

rashes, and irritations, with loss of hair, when all else fails.

Ayer’s
HairVieror
You know the story—how good
Qnoen Bess, pointing to the beautiful
liair of a peasant girl, said, “There’s a
real royal crown. I would trado my
golden one for it.” That was long ago.
Now you can have a “real royal crown”
of your own, simply by using Ayer’s
Hair Vigor. It makes the hair grow
thick and long and stops it falling
out.
When your hair is rich and heavy,
and when the (losest inspection fails
to detect a single gray hair, you will
certainly look a great deal younger,
and you will be much better satisfied
with yourself, too. Isn’t that so ?

Various Verses,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sirona.
There is a story told
About a giant
Who in a tower old
Lived care-defiant.
He had no child or wife
To love with passion,
And yet he lived his life
In joyous fashion.
Th ,i y say that he was blind,
With one gift only—
The gift to hear the wind
Singing songs lonely.
He had the finer ear
That feels dawn glowrng
Through darkness, and can hear
The green grass growing.
Ere rosy-footed Spring
Brought golden hours,
He heard the murmuring
• Of coming flowers.
He lived afar from man
The tale supposes;
Up his grey tower ran
A rhyme of roses.
And, twining through and through
Porches and arches,
Nasturtium-trumpets blew
Bold battle-marches.
Once I was, for high cheer,
On sight reliant,
Now songs august I hear,
Like that blind giant.
You brought the Golden Key,
And have displayed a
New World of Dreams to me—
Enchanting Ada !
N.S.W,
VICTOR J. DALEY.
The Victim.
What was there to love? The strong brown arm,
And a certain smile in the eager eyes.
Does a butterfly wantoning deem it harm ?
If we charm not when we have power to charm,
The gods are lenient to lovers’ lies.
But I thought I only should make believe,
I would pass his time as I passed my own,
And if one of the twain were left to grieve,
It would not be I, for no day should leave
Regret to me that its hours had flown !
I said in my heart: “ ’Tis pleasant weather,
The wattle is fair on the topmost range.
If we find it sweeter to stand together,
Shall remorse outweigh by a single feather
The wish I harbor for love—and change?”
But now that the arms no more are tender,
And the hoof-beats dull into distance grey,
Shall I be for my sin my own defender ?
A woman must wait for what Fate shall send her,
And —how you smiled as you rode away !
You smiled, and I had no answering laughter.
Were you the victim, or I the toy?
I had played that there be no losing after,
Yet I won tears and you won laughter.
Ah ! how you smiled as you rode a way !
Q-
M. FORREST.
Par Away.
Far away, oh, far away !
Where the golden morning breaketh
Over purple summer seas,
Rippling, sparkling, in the bay,
Splashing softly on the strand—
On the shining, yellow sand;
When the reign of Summer waketh
In that distant summer land
Far away.
Far away, oh, far away !
Where the dusty road winds down,
Past where oak and willow trees
Dream throughout the drowsy day.
Where the snowy orchards lie,
Bridal-robed ’neath azure sky,
Winding on towards the town
Where the swift-winged sea-birds fly
Far away.
Far away, oh, far away !
0 ! the dainty garden bowers
With the great, sweet, yellow roses,
Sweeter than the scent of May.
O, the little sunny town !
O, the little white roofed town,
Sleeping through the quiet hours
By the hillside green and brown,
Far away.
Faraway, oh, faraway !
Setting sun behind the hill,
Flinging shadows dark and vast
On the waters of the bay,
While the wavelets kiss the shore,
Coming, going ever more;
Where the dusk is cool and still,
And the stars light heaven’s floor,
Far away.
I shall never see it more.
I have left it all behind
On the weary round of time;
Never see the shining shore.
Nor the road that windeth down
From the hillside to the town ;
Nor the scented evening wind
Swing the roses as of yore,
Never more.

WE have always given proof of anything that we
claimed for our Electric Belt, because we know
that there are people who claim a great deal more for
their remedies than the truth would justify. If you
want a remedy which will cure you, it seems wise for you
to take the one that has cured others. We have published
thousands of testimonials from cured patients, and we will
pay in gold for evidence showing that we have ever used a
testimonial which was not true and honest.

Tfie Finger Post to Health
This is an Interesting Story
for Liver Sufferers.
The case of
Mr. G. HEATHCOTE.
(by a special reporter.)
Sihce enlightened humanity requires that
the trials incidental to sickness should be
minimised wherever possible, and since by
kindliness and consideration much can be
done in that direction, a reporter called
upon Mr. George Heathcote, of Surry-
street, Waterloo, who willingly assented
to answer any questions.
“ Were you once a resident of Bunda-
berg, Queensland ? ” asked the pressman.
“Yes,” answered Mr. Heathcote. “I
was living there when it was necessary to
cross the bridge by boat instead of walking
over it, or, to be more explicit, during the
time of the great flood, and it was during
that exciting and disastrous period that my
blood was so impoverished through exces-
sively hard work for long hours at a stretch
that sores broke out on my hands and arms,
and my legs swelled terribly. Previous to
this I had suffered from fever and ague,
which left me very weak and shaky, and
for some weeks I noticed that my appetite
was falling off ; but I put that down to
fatigue more than anything else, until other
symptoms cropped up to show me it was
not so, but my liver and kidneys which
were responsible.”
“ What reasons were there to enable you
to arrive at that conclusion ? ”
“ Any number of them, one of the most
unmistakable being a nasty pain which
caught me here (Mr. Heathcote indicated
the part affected by placing his hand on the
small of his back). My back ached so in-
tensely that my wife made flannel belts for
me to wear, thinking that they would afford
me some relief. If I was doing anything
which caused me to bend down, the pain on
straightening myself was something terrible,
while walking also provoked great distress
and inconvenience. Other proof that my
kidneys were in a bad way was also in
evidence, and as for the rest of my ail-
ments—well, I hardly know where to begin
first. ”
“ Tell me a few of the most important—
those that are uppermost in your mind ? ”
“ Oh ! I have not forgotten any of them,”
was the quick response, “ especially the
heavy feelings in my chest, which made me
short-winded. After eating, a weighty sen-
sation appeared in that quarter, and before
I knew where I was my stomach began
swelling out with wind, which made me
very uncomfortable always, and at times
gave rise to sharp, cutting pains. The
sour gases gradually worked their way up,
and caused ine to belch, after which, and
until I took a little more food, I felt
slightly easier, but the same unpleasantness
followed each meal, however trifling. When
making my morning preparations for work
I used to feel as if I would like to go back
to bed again, as I was entirely devoid of
energy, and had no desire to attempt any-
thing. This languidness was due, no doubt,
to the restlessness every nig it. I could go
to bed feeling so drowsy that my eyes
seemed swollen for the want of rest, yet I
found myself awake the greater part of the
night, and when I got up my limbs were
all aches. Nearly every day I was dis-
tracted with intense headaches-, which ap-
peared to bring a mist before tny eyes, as
if my sight was failing me, and without any
warning my head became so giddy that I
had to take a rest till the sensation passed
away. Every month I was getting weaker
and more wretched, being continually be-
set w ith pains under my shoulder-blades,
which travelled right through to the heart,
and caused me considerable anxiety. The
white coating on my tongue explained the
unhealthy condition of my stomach, too,
and what I wanted was a real good medicine
to clear away all disorders and impurities ;
but in those days I did not know as much
as I do now, or I would have been out of
my troubles very quickly. I went from
bad to worse, and had arrived at that
melancholy and desperate stage when the
least and most simple thing excites a feeling
of irritation, and I am sure you will admit
that such a life of misery is not worth en-
during. Had I gone on a little longer in
that sorry plight I question whether I
would have been as sound a man as I am
to-day, for I was fairly in the grip of my
complaint, when, owing to the recollection
of some conversations between a few of my
friends, 1 hit upon the idea of taking some
Clements Tonic. I took immediate action,
as I firmly believed that further delay
would have brought irretrievable disaster
to my constitution.”
“ Your good fortune came at a very ac-
ceptable time, I should imagine ? ”
“ Yes ; and a very critical time, too, and
I regretted that I had not bought a few
bottles of Clements Tonic at the outset;
but we all have to buy our experience, you
know, although I intend doing all I can to
help other sufferers by letting them know
what Clements Tonic can do. Personally,
I can truthfully say that it generally re-
vived me from my lethargic state when I
had drank but a small quantity, and I found
myself rapidly improving. Clements Tonic
had a magical effect on my kidneys and
greatly relieved the pains about my back
and shoulders. This relief, coupled wi' h
the abatement of my headaches, had the
effect of making me feel more restful at
nights, and the sound sleep I got through
using Clements Tonic did me an immense
amount of good. My slumber was not in-
terfered with by dreams, and when I awoke
at the usual time for getting up I arose with
alacrity and hastened to my morning meal,
after which I was ready for work. It was
a marvellous change to be full of energy
and cheerfulness again, but the invigorating
properties of Clements Tonic were so re-
markable that I could not have restrained
my feelings of joy had I wanted to. Wind
never formed in my stomach after Clements
Tonic got to work, neither did my chest
trouble me, while in the matter of palpita-
tion the same medicine was equal to the
prevailing requirements. There is no
denying the fact that Clements Tonic
was wonderfully effective as a blood
purifier, for the sores were gradually
effaced from my hands and arms, and the
cause of my legs swelling—whatever that
cause might have been —was entirely re-
moved. My illness had considerably
affected my nerves, which became shaky
whenever I was disturbed, but to my heart-
felt thankfulness I must say that Clements
Tonic was as effective on my nervous
system as it was on my other deranged
organs.”
“ What was your appetite like then ? ”
“As it was soon after commencing on
Clements Tonic—very good, indeed, and it
has remained so ever since. But the
strengthening qualities of my newly-found
medicine surprised me, for although my
work was very heavy I always got through
it without feeling any ill effects from the
time Clements Tonic cured me, and I have
not once had the faintest return of any of
my old symptoms, in acknowledgment of
which I give you permission to publish my
story as it pleases you.”

The Gods and the Girls.
I There’s a toast that has waited proposing
Since the first wine was pressed from the grape ;
I ’Tis a toast better far than the prosing
I Of the King and the Crown and the Crape !
I There’s a pledge fit for men waits a drinking—
I ’Tis a toast set with bright eyes and curls;
I Set the hearts and the glass-rims a-clinking—
Fill them up I— To the Gods and the Girls /
’Tis a toast for a man’s heart to cherish,
’Tis a pledge for a true soul to sing ;
It’s a toast good to drink till we perish
And the arms cease to clasp and to cling 1
’Tis a toast for the strong and the loyal—
Who refuse it are outcasts and churls;
’Tis a hail to the ones truly royal—
So we drink to the Gods and the Girls.
Set a foot on the chair and the table,
Bring the best spidered wine in the bins ;
Now a cheer that shall half lift the gable—
Thank the Gods one and all for our sins !
For we owe them to Bacchus and Cupid—
They invented our vices, our pearls ;
Man without them is muddy and stupid—
Ho ! we drink to the Gods and the Girls !
’Tis a toast to the twin founts of pleasure—
A libation to Jove and to Love;
’Tis a toast for the vine’s purplest measure,
Poured out to the good Gods above.
He who drinks not is base and a varlet,
So we drain to Sweet Life as it whirls ;
Fill them now with a liquor of scarlet—
Long life to the Gods —and the Girls !

Blue-Eyes.
Do you remember long ago,
Blue-Eyes ?
We watched the Cook Strait rollers go
Into the East, where, all aglow,
The red moon swung so proud and slow
Into the rich, blue skies.
And we spoke softly, love—so low —
Do you remember long ago ?
Do you forget, Blue-Eyes ?
Do you remember how I swore,
Blue Eyes,
Tiiat I would love you evermore, *?
While there were stars on ocean’s floor—
While there were breakers on the shore.
To rush and roar and rise ?
Did you remember all I swore
And wonder why I promised, or
Did you forget, Blue-Eyes ?
I can remember nothing else,
Blue-Eyes,
But those sweet days by foam-flecked swells,
When we went gathering fluted shells,
Or dreamed *mid flowers in sunny dells
And heard the sea-gulls’ cries.
And, deep within me, something tells
That you, remembering nothing else,
Hare not forgot, Blue-Eyes.
We watched the seas together, Ah 1
Blue-Eyes ?
We saw the ships go driving far
Out where the restless currents are,
Yet something seemed my joy to mar—
I felt it throb and rise
In my hot heart; and then a star
Beckoned, and I went sea-ward ; Ah I
Do you forget, Blue-Eyes ?
Would you forgive me if I came,
Blue-Eyes,
And called you by that old, old name ?
Could I rekindle Love’s red flame ?
Would you be just the very same—
So gay and yet so wise ?
If I took all the bitter blame
Would you forgive me if I came ?
Have you forgot, Blue-Eyes ?
Do you remember ? Whisper low,
Blue-Eyes.
It seems so very long ago,
Dear, since we watched the rollers go
And heard the angry breakers throw
Their gray plumes to the skies . . .
It is so sweet, dear love, to know
That you remember long ago—
So long ago, Blue-Eyes.

The Defence Forces.
The Australian “defence” system takes the
opportunity of an outburst of war not far from
the back door of the Commonwealth to advertise
ts absurdity and proclaim its impotence. The
review held, the other day, at Hobart, when
there was a gaudy general, a gorgeous staff, and
some purple language, but no soldiery, was in one
sense an accident. But, nevertheless, it was an
epitomised description of the actual state of the
Australian military organisation. There is a
finely-clothed and eloquent general, a staff,
almost as beautiful as regards its clothes if
not its language; beyond them, nothing worth
speaking of—few men, no guns, a pinched
supply of rifles, mostly Britain’s obsolete
and cast-off weapons, and no adequate means
of manufacturing either rifles or cartridges. If
an enemy were to throw an invading force into
Australia, practically the only means of warding
off the attack would be to mobilise General
Hutton and launch him, armed with adjectives,
against the foe. If he failed to drive them back,
it is difficult to say what resource would be left to
the Commonwealth. In all probability, too, he
would fail, if for no other reason than the painful
ignorance of the average foreigner as to the
beauties of the English language.
* * * *
Yet the booming of guns in the China Sea
must awaken any Australian with a mind that can
climb above the cricket level to an appreciation of
the fact that a sense of security which goes so far
as to lead to neglect of the simplest precautions
against attack is no sense at all. By an expensive
naval tribute arrangement with Britain Australia
pays a share of tbecostof defending “the Empire, ”
but makes no provision for defending its own coun-
try. Byanexpensivemilitarysystemrunon Empire
lines under the advice of an Imperial officer, the
Commonwealth keeps in comfortable positions
certain imported and home-grown personages,
whose uniforms lend a brightness to social
functions, but is left without a real army of any
sort. There are men banded together in a Per-
manent Force, in “ Partially Paid ” and Volunteer
regiments, but they aro practically without arms,
and their chief occupation seems to be grumbling
at the personages before mentioned, or being
grumbled at by them. In one respect, and in one
respect alone, is the Australian military system
complete, and that is in regulations. There are
enough regulations in existence to run half-a-
dozen Napoleonic campaigns, and whenever there
is a complaint as to the efficiency of the military
machine a fresh regulation is drafted, by which
the D.A.M.F. is to report to the A.G.C.L.F.
through the D.A.G., instead of through the
C.O.D.F. as before.

Seriously, Australia is for all practical purposes
defenceless. And, defenceless as it is, it has
national aspirations and enacts exclusive legisla-
tion which may at any time bring it into conflict
with an armed enemy. Yet, supposing the present
naval and military muddle to continue until a war-
crisis came, it is difficult to see what attitude
Australia could take but a Chinese and prostrate
one. There would be no use in rushing against
modern rifles with road metal. The days are
dead vvhen a bill-hook or a stave with a stout
heart urging It on was a military weapon to be
seriously reckoned with. Supposing Australia
to possess a modern small-arms factory and
enough powder mills, it would have some
hope in a fight. With the fleet that it pays
for fighting someone else’s battles away in a
far sea, with its great cities in ruins for want of
protecting squadrons and batteries, it could still
fall back on its fields and hold them against the
wave of invasion. But even for that desperate
game there are no cards on the table. Under
present conditions Australia could not even
undertake a guerilla defence.
* * * *
It is a scandalous reflection on the national
Parliament that such should be the state of affairs;
no task could better claim the immediate atten-
tion of an Australian Ministry than the founding
of the elements of a defence system in the Com-
monwealth. To effect that there are necessary
three steps :
1. The establishment of a small arms factory, an
arsenal capable of turning out large guns, and ammunition
factories. (This is put as the first step because the main
essential is to get guns. Even a mob with guns would be
of some use ; an army, however nicely drilled, beauti-
fully dressed and vilely hair-oiled, without guns, would
b» of no use at all.)
2. A law to make every healthy male adult undergo
(without pay) the rudiments of military training, and to
encourage (with pay) a certain proportion of citizens to
train for the more technical tasks of a modern army.
3. The extension of the Undesirable Immigrants Act to
all military instructors from abroad, especially British
officers.
The programme contains somi contentious
matter, but it is the minimum needed for effective
reform. An army must have guns, and it must
make its guns in its own country, since it will not
be able to import them Yvhen they are most
needed. An army must have men, and in the
case of a small people inhabiting a large land,
every man must be enrolled to do his share in
preparing for the national defence. An army
must have a sensible, effective and economical
system of administration, and therefore must
keep at the farthest possible distance all British
instructors, for Britain, of all countries on earth,
muddles its army administration most abomin-
ably. The officer who is trained under system
which costs so much in clothes, polo, afternoon
tea, private theatricals, horse-racing, &c., that
only a rich man can be an officer, is of no use to a
country like this. Indeed it might almost
be hazarded that if the practice of import-
ing military commanders and instructors from
England wore abolished, all the other neces-
sary reforms would follow in due course.
What Australia does not want is an army
modelled on that of Great Britain. The latter
country maintains military forces chiefly for the
entertainment of lordlings, snobs and rich fools
who, without an army to play the fool with, would
be lonesome and would be always crying for their
mothers. As the British titled matron must go
into society, the army has been organised to keep
her cubs amused. Since the British people are
rich, and have a gigantic reputation as fighters in
the past to fall back upon, an army of the sort
that country indulges in is not immediately fatal.
Like Freetrade, it can be endured for a while.
But Australia is not rich, and has no great
fighting reputation to point to when a foe
threatens trouble. Consequently Australia wants
an army which shall be cheap, effective, and in
its organisation democratic. All these things are
utterly opposed to the typical British officer’s
notions, and therefore the British officer must be
kept as far away from the Australian army as
possible, if the necessary Whole Hog reform is
to be carried out.
* * * *
Whole Hog the reform would need to be to
change the present Australian muddle-and-cuss
into an army. The greater portion of the very
large sum now devoted to military purposes is
absorbed by “ staff officers.” Most of these are
something worse than unnecessary. A few mili-
tary instructors are required ; a few engineering
and electrical experts; beyond them, the
“staff officer” is a nuisance. An Australian
officer against whom allegations of misconduct
were understood to have been made wished to
ask for an inquiry to clear himself. He was an
officer of years standing, and a lawyer to boot,
but, after devoting some weeks to the task, he was
unable to find out how it was possible for him to
acquaint the proper people in the proper way
with his very proper desire. It was not the right
thing for him to write directly to the Minister for
Defence, to the Federal Commandant, to the
N.S.W. Commandant, or to the officer command-
ing his regiment. (It is practically never the
right thing to write directly to anyone under the
British army system.) The aggrieved individual
made several attempts to let the military people
know that he Yvished for an inquiry, but
all bis letters were sent back to him—
because of some informality. He asked how
he should proceed, and was told to “proceed
in proper form,” but he mever did manage to
learn the proper form. Another military man
wished to draw attention to the conduct of an
officer who was suspected of malversation. He
consulted every possible book on the subject and
several staff officers, and then found that his com-
munication was informal. And the British mili-
tary personage who reads a letter which has not
reached him quite formally is incapable of taking
any notice thereof. There is a tradition that an
English officer in India once received a telegram
from the regimental surgeon telling him that his
wife “ on the hills” had smallpox, and asking him
to send up a special doctor and nurse. But, as
the communication had not been sent through the
D.A.S.M.G. or some such person, the recipient
simply couldn’t take any notice of it. When,
later, he heard of his wife’s death from lack of
proper care, the message came through a non-
military source, and he was able, therefore, to
shoot himself promptly in non-official remorse.
The Indian story may not be true ; the Australian
instances are. That’s the work for which “staff
officers ’ are kept—that and a mean sort of spying
called confidential reporting, and general back-
biting and intrigue. The whole system of circum-
locution and of spying needs to be swept away,
partly because it is useless and expensive, partly
because it is mischievous.
• • * *
On citizen lines, without gold lace, feathers or
other flummery, with a general conscription
limited as to its time demand, with no snobbery,
no circumlocution and no British commanding
officer, an Australian army would not be
particularly costly, and it might be made
highly effective. There is excellent fighting
material in Australia—especially in the country
districts—and in many cases a very small amount
of instruction would convert the citizen into a
fighting man. The man who is a good shot and
a good horseman has gone most of the way to be-
come a good soldier. A great deal of the fight-
ing material is not available now because an Aus-
tralian of the right type hesitates to put himself
under the discipline of the present contemptible
military organisation; and what material is ottered
is made the worst possible use of. But a citizen
soldiery, sternly disciplined, but governed without
class snobbery, organised on the lines adopted by
the French Republic after the Revolution, would
attract the bush worker, the miner, and, to
some extent, the city mechanic and laborer, "’here
the present system seems to mainly draiv the snob
and the city loafer anxious to parade the bars in a
gaudy uniform. If in the course of events the Aus-
tralasian Government is re-organised on Radical
lines, The Bulletin hopes to see it grapple with
this defence question seriously. The Federal
Labor party showed that it bad the right grasp
of the position during the life of the last Parlia-
ment, and to any Government in which it shares
control might be Yvell entrusted the task of reform
—a reform running on three main lines : Aus-
tralian manufacture of Australian arms, universal
liability to service, and the training of the army
on Australian lines by Australian officers.
Certain Tory Doctors, Some Facts,
and a Lie.
“ To make the people breed you must sweat the
workers.” That is the one sociological conclusion
to which the N.S.W. Birth-rate Commission
triumphantly comes. On matters of medicine, on
statistical subjects, its conclusions and suggestions
are sound enough. It is when it strays from the
domain of exact fact to seek by induction the
ultimate cause of the prevention evil that it comes
to the curious decision that trades-unionism is
responsible. Passing over the truths that it might
have noticed, it flaunts that huge fallacy as
the result of its observation and reasoning.
A blind and stupid Toryism seems to have
dominated the majority of the Commissioners
where the inquiry touched upon the “ political ”
side, and to have prevented them from coming to
an accurate judgment of causes and remedies.
Not only in what it omits is the report faulty,
but in the remarkable falsehood which it parades
as a scientific conclusion. An astonishing thing
is that such a report should be put before the
public as a unanimous one. From gentlemen
such as Messrs. M’Laurin, Mackellar, Knox,
Littlejohn, Fosbery and Foreman a reasonable
judgment on a subject which is partly economic
and partly social was not to be expected. Some
of them are provided with a capacity to judge,
others palpably not, but all are so mentally
warped by stupid and unreasoning Tory prejudice
that their opinion on any sociological issue is
valueless. It is not, therefore, altogether sur-
prising to find those gentlemen committing them-
selves to such a statement as that trades-unionism
is responsible for a dwindling birth-rate in N.S.W.
But there were others on the Commission.
• * * *
Dr. Nash has, in the N.S.W. Upper House,
shown himself a Liberal, almost a Radical. Mr.
Holman, M.P., is a member of the Labor party.
Mr. T. A. Coghlan, as a State servant, can have
no public opinions on politics, but is too intelli-
gent and Yvell-informed a man to be a Tory.
From Mr. Hughes, ex-Mayor of Sydney, and
Dr. Paton, Government Medical Officer, some-
thing better was to be expected than an acqui-
escence in. the pitiably silly fiction that trades-
unionism is one of the origins of the social
evil which the dwindling birth-rate proves.
Why is there no minority report from these
gentlemen—no repudiation of an allegation
which is exactly contrary to whatever evidence
can be obtained on the point ? In the absence of
such a minority report they must take the re-
sponsibility of approving what is made public
under their names. It, is a heavy burden of
ignorance and prejudice to stagger under.
* * * *
The sentence in which the Commission ex-
presses its sentiments on the connection between
democracy and the birth-rate is not very distinctly
phrased ; if what has leaked out as to the pro-
ceedings of the commission is correct, it represents,
in a form modified from its primal savagery, the
doctrine of the prime old Tories (one gentleman
boasts that he would “ have rubbed it in much
more strongly ” if he had been allowed his own
way); but its meaning is clear enough :
Legislative regulation of the conditions of employment
has not, as yet, as far as can be traced by statistics, had
any tangible influence upon the birth-rate; but we
cannot overlook the fact that restrictive regulations of
trade, designed to abolish competition, effectually inter-
fere with the continuity of employment in many walks of
life, so that the income of those employed is more or less
precarious, and this cannot fail to indirectly discourage
the existence of large families, and the natural increase
of population which would ensue therefrom.
There ignorance and class prejudice speak,
and speak most clumsily. The accusation that
trades-unionism (“ restrictive regulations of trade
designed to interfere with the continuity,” etc.)
is responsible for the decline of the birth-rate is
put spitefully, and phrased so as to include a lie
within a lie ; for that trades-unionism “effectually
interferes with the continuity of employment ” is
just as much a falsehood as that the decline of
the N.S.W. birth-rate can be traced to any
interruption of the continuity of employment.
Not satisfied with that, the Tories seek to make
a vicious inference with the statement that as yet
such legislation as the Arbitration Act and the
Factories Act has not had any detrimental effect
on the birth-rate, as if it were practically certain
that the detrimental effect would arrive in the
near future.
* * * *
If the Commission had been capable of coming
to an honest conclusion on the facts before it, its
verdict as to the social result of the efforts of the
workers to improve their lot by combination would
have been exactly otherwise. There is no doubt
that trades-unionism, by shortening hours, by
raising wages, by insisting on sanitary comfort in
workshops, by discouraging the employment of
immature children at work which would stunt
their growth, adds materially to the productive
capacity of the population—makes the large and
healthy family more possible. It may be that
when trades-unionism has done that much, other
causes then fail, and the couple who through
trades-unionism have been protected from stunt-
ing in their youth, and are now' secured a
greater degree of comfort than would be
otherwise possible to them, do not add to the
population as they might. But that implies
nothing against trades-unionism, which has at
least taken them the long step of making a family
decently possible. Something of that truth peeps
out even in this Tory report when it is admitted
that the regulation of the hours and conditions of
female factory labor has bad a beneficial effect.
And when the members of the commission pro-
ceeded to suggest medical remedies for infant
mortality the Tory doctors, in the extent of their
medical knowledge, forgot their political ignorance
and actually recommended further State socialism
—in the direction of State education of mothers by
posters and pamphlets, State education of girl
children in the care of infants, State control of the
sale of infant foods, municipal socialism in the
provision of milk depots, and extension of State
hospitals and foundling asylums, and the State
system of boarding-out poor infants. I* v,out
when it wandered away from medical points a do
which it was well-informed, to probe into
problems of social philosophy, about which t
majority of its members were either ignorant,
prejudiced, or both, that the commission blu -
dered. The Tory majority would probably ha\
blamed trades-unionism and Labor legislation 1
it had been asked for an opinion on the causes ?
the bubonic plague. A scapegoat was thought to
be necessary, and, to a certain class, the Labor
party is scapegoat-in-ordinary. Some lories
blame the Labor party when their aged finders
fumble o\ er-long at their collar-stud in the morning.
» * » *
A truthful impeachment, if it is sought to
probe into the causes of the prevention
habit, would have to be directed, not against the
masses of the people, but the classes, the well-to-
do, going-into-society folk—the folk of the class
to which the majority of the Birth-rate Commis-
sion belonged. It is they who have set the fashion
in prevention, without having available as an
excuse that narrowness of means makes large
families inconvenient. It is against them that an
accusation of promoting race-suicide should be
launched. This fact is shown clearly enough by
the statistics embodied in the report. Paragraph
64 reads:—
The statistics collected from the information obtained
from the registrations of deaths during the quinquennial
period 1898-1902 afford the following comparison of the
respective average issue of marriages to the
occupations of the husbands who died within that
period:
In the domestic occupations (grooms, married
couples, etc.) .. 4"32
~ professional 4*59
~ commercial .. .. .. .. .. 4*70
~ industrial b'27
~ agricultural .. 6'28
These figures represent the average number of children
born to women, the great majority of whom were married
before there was any marked decline in the birth-rate ;
and, therefore, they do not indicate the expected average
issue of present-day marriages. Nevertheless, the Com-
mission have reason to believe that the proportionate
differences which the figures disclose will be maintained.
These differences in the average issue of the various
classes enumerated may be accounted f®r to a slight
extent b}’ difference in age at marriage.
The class which is least prolific is that engaged
in domestic occupations i.e., grooms, cooks,
station married couples, butlers, and so on. This
class is made up almost exclusively of the victims
of the well-to-do, who are forced to be sterile so
that their brats may not come between the wind
and the nobility of the rich. The average squatter
bans the baby on his run ; the married couples
that he employs must be “ without encum-
brances.” The fashionable rich in the cities
refuse all possibility of family life to their
servants, who must also be “without encum-
brances.” Next to this class on the list
of those parsimonious with children came the
professional people—the Maclaurins and Mac-
kellars and Foremans and the commer-
cial people. These are far less prolific than
the workers—the trades-union class to which the
Maclaurins and the Mackellars
charge the offence of which their own class is
guilty. The artisan and the agricultural worker
are, in respect of parentage, the most patriotic and
moral of all. Had the N.S.W. Birth-rate Com-
mission, after ascertaining the facts, progressed
from sound medical conclusions to honest socio-
logical inductions its report would have had much
influence for good. As it is, the blind Tory
stupidity shown in some portions, will probably
invalidate in the popular mind what there is of it
that is well-reasoned and truthful.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Abolishing 1 the Upper House.
Premier Seddon, of Maoriland, who has done
nothing remarkable for some little time, announces
his intention to get rid of the Upper House of his
State Legislature. Seddon may not be quite the
Democrat he was, but there is still the material of
a very sturdy and progressive Democrat about
Richard of Kumara, and his resolve to simplify the
needlessly bloated and cumbersome processes of
legislation is most commendable. Anything that
simplifies the processes of legislation, and abolishes
useless relics, excrescences, warts, frills, survivals,
and silly remnants, represents progress. Upper
Houses have long been recognised by all intelli-
gent persons as the superfluous lingering of an old
disused remains or misfortune. They exist in
many outlying parts of the British Empire because
Britain has an Upper House ; also there are
Upper Houses in many foreign countries solely in
imitation of the “Mother of Parliaments” at
Westminster. Yet Britain never deliberately
created its Upper House, and never went in
deliberate search for one. That body exists just
as a wart does—because it happened. England
has had a Parliament of one House, and also one
of four Houses ; it was the most casual kind of a
toss-up that prevented it finally settling down
with a Parliament of three Houses. Its bi-
cameral Legislature and its hideously incompre-
hensible table of weights and measures are alike
things of accident. The House of Lords does not
exist because it is supposed to do any good in the
way of legislation, or to be of any benefit
whatsoever to the people, but simply because an
hereditary nobleman is supposed to have an
hereditary and inherent right to legislate,
even though he may not be able to legislate
worth a copper. If Britain had no hereditary
nobility it seems reasonably safe to say that it
would have no Second Chamber. In Australasia,
this country having no dukes with an alleged
inborn right to legislate, we try to persuade our-
selves that there is an inborn right of legislation
in old worn-out tailors and unsuccessful cheese-
mongers, who are sent to die Upper House for
life and told to look as like dukes as they can.
Britain tolerates the peers of Argyll and Nor-
folk as law-makers because they are at least rem-
nants of history. There is a haze of old legend
about their names. The first of the Argyll race
that we clearly remember pursued Robert Bri ck
with kilts and bloodhounds and an unfriendly
expression, and the first Norfolk who looms up
very definitely in the ordinary man’s memory
found insulting and larrikin expressions pinned
on N to his tent at Boswortb telling him
that Dickon, his master, was bought and
sold. And because of these things N.S. W.
sends James Blanksby, who was something in a
building society, and Hepher, the tailor, to its
House of Lords to legislate for life, and tells
Blanksby to try to look like John of Lorn, and
Hepher to be as similar to Jockey of Norfolk as
his naturally unwarlike countenance will permit.
It is a pitiable and insulting joke —a sillv process
of guying an aged and infirm relative. The
nigger Emperor of Hayti didn’t “poke borak
quite so savagely at a foolish old British in-
stitution when he started his House of Lords
by creating a big buck African “ Duke of
Marmalade.” In Maoriland, as in N.S.W.,
the nominee Upper House has long been a
thing of pity. It consists mostly of cast-off


politicians who can no longer get any one to elect
tnem to the Lower House. When it dissents
rorn the Assembly it is suppressed ; when it says
Cll i°i t^ie Assembly it is useless —a cockatoo
could say as much as that. Premier Seddon has
wisely resolved to get rid of this silly and
disrespectful parody. And in doing so he at
least has precedent behind him. There are a
multitude of legislative bodies in the Bi’itish
Empire, and a full half of them, if not more, are
run on the one-House principle.
lioftus, Dailey, and the Soudan
Contingent.
** J-T.D.” writes : When the Soudan Contingent
returned to Sydney in June, 1885, “Hof’’im-
proved the occasion by giving us in The Bulletin
the well-remembered caricature of Lady Butler’s
picture, “ The Roll Call.” Dalley was on horse-
back as the general of the ragged remains of the
band of heroes. Augustus Loftus, just deceased,
who was Governor of New South Wales at the
time, was represented as an officer calling the
names. Loftus had a fowl between his feet.
This was a poetic touch, which reminds us that
the old gentleman made a bit on the quiet by
dealing in eggs and “fancy poultry.” Sydney
Telegraph in its obituary of Augustus Loftus
remarked: ‘ ‘ While Governor of New South Wales
he delivered at the departure of the Soudan
Contingent a fine patriotic speech, which wasexten-
sively quoted in England.” The speech referred
to was read by the feeble Augustus at Circular
Quay on March 3, 1885. It had been written
for the occasion by William Bede Dalley, who
was then aeting-Premier. Dalley stood at the old
Governor’s elbow and joined in the applause.
When the speech was printed in the papers,
everyone knew it was Dalley’s. No man knew
better how to blend playful humor with mock
heroics. Here is some Dalley as delivered by
Loftus
Countless as have been the occasions when the blood
and treasure of England have been poured out freely to
protect the people, to shield the defenceless, and to
maintain the right, there never has been one in which
humanity is more deeply interested in the triumph of the
arms of England than the cause which you are heroically
resolved to uphold by your valor. You will be greeted
in Egypt by the hearty welcome of thousands of
chivalrous soldiers who have never yet looked upon
such an action as yours. The eyes of your
gracious Queen will be bent upon your exertions,
and in every part -of the world where our
flag floats, men and women and children will
eagerly read of your exploits and pray for your suc-
cess. Soldiers, you carry in your keeping the honor of
this great colony which has made such splendid sacrifices
to send you to the front with an equipment of which
nations most practised in war might have been proud ;
and you will have the glorious privilege of helping to
maintain the honor of the Empire. In your ranks are
numbers who are voluntarily leaving the paths of for-
tune, worldly advantages, the comforts of home, and the
sweetness of domestic life for heroic service in a bloody
war in which already many brave men have been stricken
down. Soldiers, you leave us amidst the acclamations of
your fellow citizens whose hearts will be with you in your
camps and your conflicts —amidst an enthusiasm of
aflmiration and sacrifice unexampled—with the sym-
pathies of every true citizen of the Empire—
with our earnest hope that it may be your glorious
privilege to share in the triumph as in the service, and
to come back to us crowned with England’s gratitude,
as you are now encompassed with her sympathies.
Soldiers, on the part of your fellow-citizens I now say to
you—Farewell ! And may God have you in His holy
keeping.
The N.S.W. contingent did not strike a single
blow for the empire. It did not take part in any
engagement. Leaving Sydney on March 3, 1885,
the “heroes” were back at Circular Quay on
June 24. Six heroes had died of fever, over-
feeding and alcohol. Governor Loftus got off
another speech (written by Dalley) at the Victoria
Barracks. Said the Governor: —
It has been not the least gratifying circumstance in the
history of our enterprise that you have not been called
upon to exercise in any bloody engagement the courage
and devotion which prompted you to volunteer for the
defence of the empire. While this has been a source of
disappointment to you, it is a subject for our gratitude to
Heaven. All the duties that were laicLppon you you
have discharged with the instant obedience of good
soldiers and with the alacrity of gallant men.
A third speech written by Dalley was fired off
by Loftus at the citizens’ banquet to the returned
contingent at the Exhibition Building on July 28,
1885. Dalley spoke at the banquet, and compli-
mented the Governor upon his “eloquent and
elevating address.” Lord Loftus returned to
England in 1885. He was threatened with arrest
for debt on the mailboat. A couple of days before
the departure of the mail-steamer Dalley raised
the money among a few political and private
friends ; so there was no scene and no scandal.
♦
A Deputation.
A pathetic deputation waited, a few days ago,
on Acting-Premier Wise, of N.S.W. It repre-
sented the great mass of men who have been
thrown out of work through the loan money having
practically given out, and it wanted the Govern-
ment to find more loan money somewhere, and
invent more public works, in order to avert a
calamity. The deputation led to no definite
result. It held that the Government was bound
to find work for the people, and the Acting-Premier
forcibly disagreed, and there was a deadlock. The
whole proceeding was a sorrowful comment on the
insane policy of trying to keep a country pros-
perous by imports and loans, but both parties,
unfortunately, adhered closely to the present
effect, and nobody took any stock of the more or
less remote cause. The situation in N.S.W., and
to some extent, also, in" other States, is that
there is a very large section of the population
which depends wholly on loans for its existence.
If at any time Bull refuses to lend, Heaven only
knows, just at present, what is to become of this
section. While Bull will lend, it is understood
to be the duty of the Government to invent jobs
for this section of the community, and spend the
loan money on these jobs. The jobs don’t pay,
and the amount of interest on the State’s public
debt which is not covered by the revenue from
public works, and which has to be made good by
taxation, is now about £1,200,000 a year. If
Bull keeps lending, and N.S.W. keeps building
public works that don’t pay interest in order
to supply employment, the amount of interest
which has to be raised by taxation will
increase indefinitely, and the final result will be
insolvency. In any ordinary, well-governed com-
munity 1,400,000 consumers are able to supply
employment for 1,400,000 producers, but N.S.W.
.(and Australia in general) has acquired a curious
disease which seems to make it unlike any other
country. N.S.W. has suffered for years from the
idea that it is better to import things and
deprive its people of employment than to make
tilings and employ its own people; and having
thus carefully deprived the people of employment
it has spent many millions of loan money on hope-
lessly unpayable works to find employment for
the people. Acting-Premier Wise has frequently
voted for this policy. The people who are
now unemployed in Sydney have, to a great
extent, voted for it. Sydney Telegraph is
even now publishing wild and whirling articles
to the effect that if, say, £250,000 worth of
looomotives can be manufactured a little more
cheaply in England than here, it is a positive duty
to send the work and the money to England—and
borrow £250,000 to keep the local people employed
at something else, and pay £IO,OOO a year interest
on the loan, and find the same old unemployed
problem waiting when the loan is spent. The
Freetrade theory is that we shouldn’t produce any
manufactured goods unless we can produce them
as cheaply as our cheapest competitor. If the
theory was carried to its logical conclusion, then
we should grow no agricultural produce unless we
could grow it as cheaply as everybody else, and
borrow no money unless we could borrow it
as cheaply as everybody else, and build no
railways unless we could build them _as
cheaply as the cheapest of foreign countries.
But the Freetrade theory has struck against a
snag. It lasted while loans lasted. If they have
really given out, either the unemployed must
starve or remunerative work must be found for
them at making something. One way of finding
work is by letting the unemployed make a few
million pounds’ worth of the things we now im-
port ; even if they don’t make them quite so
cheaply at first as the foreigner can do, still it is
better to pay £1,100,000 a year for goods that
would otherwise cost £1,000,000, and lose £IOO,OOO
a year for a time, than to borrow £1,000,000 a year
to keep the unemployed going at unprofitable
jobs—and lose £1,000,000 a year indefinitely.
Sydney persistently returns men like Pulsford,
Neild and Gray to the Australian Parliament, to
holler for lots of imports and no local industries.
Have they anything to suggest out of the resources
of the importing gospel, as a means of finding
work for 5000 or 6000 unemployed ? If these men
shouldn’t make locomotives, what should they
make 1
Secret Commissions.
The old sore of secret commissions has been un-
covered again in Melbourne. A butter and
produce shipping co., having lost money lately,
proposed to reconstruct; and one of its creditor
firms objected. The co. hit back in an affidavit, in
which it alleged that the principal creditor firm
(in much the same line of business) had got on
better than other people because it had accepted
from the shipping co.’s a secret commission of 3
percent, on all freights paid through it as shipping
agent for actual producers. Subsequently, tne co.
which was in difficulties said, having found
out what the other firm had been getting,
it had itself demanded the same concession from
the shipping co., and had collected £lOOO. Now,
probably the co. in the difficulties doesn’t know
for certain what happened as between the
shipping co. and the other firm, but it ought to
know all about the £lOOO which it got itself ; and
the fact that it demanded the money because
somebody else had been paid, and got it, is very
strong presumptive evidence that somebody else
actually was paid too —the shipping co. would
hardly have handed out the £lOOO otherwise. On
top of that came action by the actual producers ;
they sent round for signature among the ship-
ping agents— their shipping agents, the people
whom were paying to get the best possible
freights for them—an affidavit, setting out that
the signatories had not accepted any such second
commissions. And six refused to sign it, or, any-
way, didn’t sign it. In all the circumstances it
may be regarded as practically proved, then, that
secret commissions have been taken ; whatever
firms haven’t taken them, it is pretty clear that
some have. And this has happened at a time
when the agricultural and dairying industry
has been in an unusually bad way, and when
every ounce of help that could be given it
was needed—when there has been a cry for
concessions from an already embarrassed State for
this very industry, and when Kyabramapootra
has crowed aloud for economy, and has in particu-
lar denounced “socialistic legislation” as the
cause of the State’s troubles. If there was one
lot of ’Pootras who crowed louder than others it
was the city middlemen flock —a flock which
always can be relied upon to be very severe con-
cerning “socialistic legislation” and the obstacles
placed in the way of Private Enterprise. And
this is the flock which is now practically
convicted of bleeding the farmer over
whose woes it lately wept ! While the
middleman has yelled for economy, he, or
part of him, has put into his own pocket a 3
per cent, commission, which, morally, if not also
legally, belonged to the very men whose cause he
was hypocritically championing, and for whose
hardships he was blaming everybody but himself,
and every system but the one under which he was
feathering his own nest. For as to the immorality
of second commissions there can be no doubt. It
is doubtful, in fact, where there can be a second
commission ; there is no doubt, though, that there
can be one commission and one bribe. A man
pays an agent to get the best terms he can
for him; if the party from whom the agent
is supposed to screw these terms also pays
the agent, it is proof that the principal isn’t
getting the best terms possible. If the shipping
co.’s could afford to pay the agent 3 per cent.,
they could afford to charge the shippers 3 per
cent. less. In. England the law in the matter lias
been pretty clearly defined ; in Australia, unfor-
tunately, it has not yet been. Possibly these dis-
closures may help matters on. In any case, they
ought to open the eyes of the Victorian farmer to
a suspicion of the real character of some of those
“ friends ” who ran him into his recent outbreak
of Kyabramapootrism.

A Commonwealth Exhibition.
The Australian Prime Minister, in reply to a sug-
gestion that population should be attracted by
holding “a Great Australian Commonwealth
Exhibition,” has been, very properly, non-com-
mittal and snubby. There is in public affairs
nothing more pathetic than the notion that pros-
perity is a plant that can be cultivated without
hard labor, that there is some short and easy
path by which a nation can become great
without grafting for its greatness. Australia has
this notion pretty badly. It was mainly responsible
for the borrowing policy, that robust folly which
had its foundation in the belief that the path to
the pawnshop is the path to progress, and that
Cohen of London in a benevolent person with a
nose, anxious only to help us “todevelop our magni-
ficent natural resources.” It, too, is responsible
for the present notion that the difficulties, to which
borrowing and land monopoly and the lack of
adequate Protection have brought Australia, are
to be solved by holding an “ exhibition ” —a sort
of agricultural show on a large scale, where the
foreigner will display the machinery which we don’t
n.ake and the cloth which we don’t weave; and
the Australian will show his wool and pumpkins;
and the confidence man will bring a rich and rare
collection of Fiji uncles, match-boxes and Brum-
magem diamonds to gather the harvest which is
ripened for him wherever thousands gather to-
gether. An exhibition, it is claimed, would
“advertise Australia.” But Australia has so
little to advertise that any stock-taking of its
industries must lead to unfavorable comparisons.
Canada, not much older in civilisation, exports to
Australia pianos, bicycles, various sorts of
machinery, cheese, furniture, and even poultry.
Australia should at least climb up to the Canadian
level of production before it blows a trumpet to
invite the nations to come and behold its indus-
tries. There is no such easy road as a “great
international exhibition ” out of the bad situation
which is shown by the smallness of the Australian
immigration figures. The causes of existing evils
must be faced—the locking up of the fertile coast
lands and the lack of manufactures —and cured.
Holding an exhibition under the circumstances is
like hiring a brass band to cure a case of typhoid.

“Private Enterprise” in a New Role.
Dear Bulletin. —What looks like an impudent
attempt to defy the law and to flout the “con-
tract ” provisions of the Immigration Restriction
Act is, to all appearance, being worked just now
by the locking-out bosses of the Outtrim (Gipps-
land) coal mines. A brief paragraph from its
local correspondent notified in the Argus of 2nd
inst. that “the six imported Scotch mine-bosses
had refused to fulfil their engagements, having
been urged thereto by the leaders of the
V.C.M.A.; but that there were signs that some
of them were weakening.” Next day the com-
pany’s legal manager denied that the men were
imported under contract they were merely
ordinary immigrants looking for work, he ex-
plained—and thereafter the Argus, perceiving it
had carelessly trodden on a very hot brick, shut
down on the whole circumstance and maintained
a loud silence. Now the facts in the case are
these : The Victorian union leaders got informa-
tion from Scotland, months ago, that Scottish
miners were being induced to go out to
Victoria to work in the Outtrim mines—from
which the Victorian union miners were locked
out at the end of ’O2, and which have been practi-
cally idle for over a year. The Scotchmen didn’t
say the emigrants were under contract, but that
six of them were coming out by the Orontes—the
famous six hatters, it will be remembered, came
by the same boat—and their names were given.
When these six men reached Melbourne, certain
Labor members and union leaders went on board
and interviewed them. They admitted they were
miners—not bosses—and that they came from
Scotland, but denied that their passages were
paid for them, that they were under contract, or
that they had any intention of applying at the
Outtrim-Howitt mine for employment at all.
That was 25th February. Five days later these
six miners, who all came out by the same boat,
and from the same place, had, with surprising
unanimity, found their way to the same small
township—Outtrim—and the Argus’ local corres-
pondent reported that they had declined to fulfil
their contract. The Argus man may have
made a mistake, but the surprising detail
about the affair—the thing that calls aloud for
explanation—is how six perfect strangers who, on
Thursday, had no intention of going to Outtrim
nor any knowledge of the place—on the following
Tuesday should have all arrived there, have im-
mediately been engaged to work, and have caused
such a stir by their final refusal to work. Of
course, it was carefully pointed out to them by
the Labor members in Melbourne that such a con-
tract as they were supposed to have signed was
utterly null and void, and could be broken with-
out fear of penalty, and that employers who con-
tracted such men were liable to a penalty of
£5O or three months’ gaol—but the Union
leaders could do nothing to move the Com-
monwealth Government while the suspected
contract was unprocurable, or if, as is shrewdly
suspected, it was merely a verbal one. The
Outtrim-Howitt Co. offers contract work to
all who will apply—excepting members of the
V.C.M.A. ; and, notwithstanding that it has
scoured the States for blackleg labor ever since it
brought its first train-load of riff-raff through
Melbourne last Eight-Hours Day, its monthly
output of coal for January last was not equal to
its average weekly output before the lock-out.
It has all along persistently refused arbitration,
and, as it must get more miners somehow or some-
where if it is to continue its existence, the direc-
tors were commonly supposed, as a last shift, to
have resorted to the trick of importing contract
laborers, sub rosd. And the Immigration Act
doesn’t make any provision for dealing with
suspected contracts when neither party will own
up to having made them.—F.

The cold-blooded Conroy, misrepresentative of
N.S.W. in the Federal Parliament, rehashed the
old wheeze last week that old-age pensions would
tend to destroy thrift among the people, and on
that very illogical ground he would oppose the
Federal Bill. No doubt Conroy is, at the same
time, virtuously angry that the same class of
people are restricting their increase. Yet lie is
trying to kill a measure that might possibly tend
to encourage working people to rear families.
What possible chance is there for folk with small
means to show an outward visible sign of their
having exercised thrift if they rear a family
of (say) six, give them decent food, and
keep them at school as the State de-
mands ? Even if work is continuous and health
invariably good, the house-father’s two or three
pounds a week cannot possibly stretch into much
of a surplus. And the house-mother must exercise
the keenest kind of thrift to save a little for the
emergencies that are sure to happen. So that the
thriftiest of the workers are only likely to keep
their heads above water in their best days, and in
their worst— God help them ! —the only hope for
them is that at 60 or 65—if they have managed to
escape gaol, and various other regulations have
been lived up to—there is a small sum weekly
available for the very short time still left to them.
Providing always that yapping politicians of the
Conroy variety cannot cut the amount out of the
Estimates some dull season as a matter of Reform,
and for the purpose of encouraging thrift,

The ratepayers of Melbourne city seem to have
done the right thing in electing one John
Gardiner (an old municipal identity) to be coun-
cillor in preference to a rival candidate, Curtis.
Having been duly declared non-elected, the irate
Curtis said he was now satisfied that nobody can
get into Melbourne City Council “unless he is a
Labor man to the backbone and a Roman Catholic
to the backbone,” after which he fired off the
satisfactory announcement that he would never
again apply for election. The shriek of Curtis
is an extraordinary fiction, considering that the
Council, which Curtis alleges to be Roman
Catholic and Democratic to the backbone, is
bossed by Malcolm M'Eacharn and graced by
the presence of Cornelius Job Ham. Curtis,
in fact, would pass muster as a compara-
tively harmless crank if he didn’t sound
like an agent for George Reid. What Curtis
was saying at the Carlton polling-place George
Reid was suggesting in the Federal Parliament,
and the Age next morning caught the public eye
with two cross-headings—“ Defeated Candidate’s
speech. Labor and Sectarian Influence Alleged.”
“Sectarianism in Politics. Mr. Reid and the
Labor Leader.” It was a nasty coincidence that
a pair of discredited spouters should have been
bidding for Yellow sympathy on the same night.

The Sydney Telegraph, last Monday, reported
in its Melbourne correspondence under the
heading “Threat to Public Servants”: —
Melbourne, Sunday.—The State Premier, Mr. Bent,
spoke to a large audience of farmers at the annual
Warracknabeal Hospital gathering to-day. . . . The public
servants, he was sorry to notice, had allied themselves with
the Labor party, and if they became disturbers by
political agitation, the Government would have to six
if something further should not be done with them.
The Victorian public servants were ordered by
the Irvine-Bent Government to elect representa-
tives of their own—therefore, they have to take a
hand in “political agitation.” And Premier
Bent, to all intents and purposes, according to
this report, threatens to corruptly use the power
with which he has been entrusted to punish them
if they agitate in favor of his political opponents,
and don’t vote for men that will support him. In
a less hopeless community this outrageous pro-
ceeding, supposing the matter to be correctly im-
ported, would place Premier Bent fairly within
reach ot the law, as an individual who tries to
influence voters by threatening language. What
it will do in Victoria remains to be seen.

The row between ex-Justice Stephen and ex
member of Parliament Griffith, of N.S. W., may
apparently be summarised thus : In giving judg-
ment against Griffith in a certain case Stephen
was rightly or wrongly reported (in view of the
surrounding circumstances, almost certainly
wrongly) to have made an outrageously false and
slandei ous statement about Griffith. When the
case was ended and all judicial relations between
the parties had ceased, Griffith asked the Judge
by letter to formally state that he didn't make
tne remark attributed to him. It was not a
demand for an apology, nor for a withdrawal: it
was really a request that he would assist in
making the paper retract a statement which
was equally a slander on Griffith and on the
Judge, for if the statement had been made it
would have been just as d.sgraceful to the man
who uttered it as to the man about whom it was
uttered. The Judge, in his tremendous and
A Plea for Sunday Trading 1 .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[At the Licensed Victuallers’ Picnic in Sydney on March
10th the President (Mr. J. B. Sutton) said it should not
be a crime for a poor man to get a drink on Sunday. Mr.
Owe’Sullivan, Minister for Works, responding to the
toast of “ The Ministry,” said he had always been in favor
of fair play for the liquor interests and he recognised
that men must occasionally have some liquor if they
wished for it.— Extracted from S. M. Herald report.]
I agree with J. B. Sutton
And endorse O’Sullivan !
And I do not care a button
If it angers any man !
Their remarks have brought conviction
To my mind that there’s a flaw ;
An unreasoning restriction
In the present Liquor Law !
It is true we may on Monday
Start to drink at 6 a.m.
As on every day (bar Sunday),
Still the Law I must condemn.
It is shameful, to my thinking,
Most disgraceful every way,
That we cannot keep on drinking
More than seventeen hours per day !
Though the Law may now command it,
Such a Law we should not he&d ;
I don’t know why people stand it—
No ! I really don’t,(indeed !
Hang such laws ! we do not need ’em !
That is why I write this rhyme.
people want is Freedom !
Give them Freedom all the time !
I’ll admit it is but one day
That hotels are told to close,
But suppose you’re dry on Sunday
(Not a hard thing to suppose),
Must you quench your thirst with water,
Or with lemonade, or tea ?
Why not have a beer-and-porter ?
Is this country really free ?
Though I can’t be called a glutton,
Or I hardly think I can,
I agree with Mr. Sutton
And his friend, O’Sullivan,
That this Law of Sunday-closing,
Which we surely ought to ban,
Grievous hardship is imposing
On the Suffering Working Man.
It is true, and I’m not sorry,
That a man on Saturday
Might arrange to hire a lorry,
Or a waggon, or a dray,
Or a motor car, if quicker
(Though a bit more apt to burst),
To take home a stock of liquor
To assuage his Sunday Thirst!
He could take home wine and brandy,
Schnapps and whisky, rum and gin
Any liquor that is handy
With a cart to stack it in !
He could take it by the bottle,
Or in cases, that is clear,
And to help to rinse his throttle
He could take some kegs of beer !
But as I am not omniscient,
I would ask O’Sullivan :
Would a drayload be sufficient
For a Suffering Working Man ?
Would it last him until Monday ?
If O’Sullivan says not,
Let us open pubs, on Sunday,
For the Liquor Law is rot!
Let the barmaids and the barmen,
And the bonifaces meek,
And the brewers and their carmen,
All Work Seven Days a Week !
They’re not worth consideration—
They are merely slaves, in fact,
Who require no Arbitration,
And no Early Closing Act!

grumpy dignity, refused. Later Griffith, like
many others, objected to the payment to Justice
Stephen of the Chief Justice’s salary while full
salary was also being drawn by the real Chief
Justice; and Stephen took the first opportunity
to betray in the papers the old private corres-
pondence with Griffith, and to cordially assure
the public that be didn't for a moment suspect
Griffith of opposing the payment of two Chief
Justices’ salaries merely because of that bygone
letter. Which vaguely suggests the generous
remark ascribed to an old-time candidate: “ I
assure you, gentlemen, that I don’t believe there
is any truth in the common report that my
opponent defrauded his aged grandmother of all
she possessed.” After that act of generosity all
the opponent’s efforts to prove that his aged
grandmother died before he was born went for
very little.

Does anyone remember, in the pauses of
getting his living and paying or evading his debts,
an essay of the late Robert Louis Stevenson in
which the boys of the boy Stevenson’s neighbor-
hood are described as going about after nightfall
with bull’s-eye lanterns strapped to their waists,
inside their coats. “ Have you got your lantern ? ”
was the dark, husky query when two of these em-
bittered conspirators met. “ Yes ! ” and the coats
would be unbuttoned and the lights displayed for
a second. There was no levity in the proceed-
ing, and the lads cultivated each a gloomy
frown and the hostile aspect of a fortress. On
the revival of the “ Sign of the Cross ” at the
Sydney Her Majesty’s, last Saturday, one person
at least recalled the memory and laughed. The
uusanctified mirth occurred at the point where
the two boss Christians, Favius and Titus, meet,
and, after exchanging mysterious Wilson Barrett
glances and hoarse Latin whispers, pull up their
sleeves and exhibit the sign of the cross (in
charcoal) on their arms. One simply can-
not take the “Sign of the Cross” seriously,
chiefly because the early Christian martyr seems
so unpleasant and sorrowful and needlessly husky.
We are quite willing to give him all the honor we
don’t want for ourselves, but we would much
rather have Marcus Superbus or Licinius to
dinner. Mercia isn’t unpleasant, hence she is the
cause of a lot of trouble. The most convincing
tiling in the present revival is Julius Knight’s
love-making. He has a good idea of how “the
brute aroused in the man ” would roar and rend
its prey. He folds his arms high up on the roof
of his chest at times, and the hang of his toga is a
marvel of skill. If the original Marcus wore his
with the same artistic but negligent.droop Mercia
must have indeed been unimpressionable. Maud
Jeffries plays the white-faced spiritual maiden
who goes about Rome bare - headed in so
beautifully passionless a way that one doubts if
the lions got any red blood and satisfaction from
their meals in the days of old. Memories af

and Johnston Weir as Licinius are well fitted.
So are Madge Hope as Poppea, Olive Noble as
Dacia, and Rose Pendennis as Berenice. Eardley
Turner is good in everything, and as the drinky

“The Face at the Window,” described as
“a remarkable detective story of real life,” was
revived at Sydney Lyceum on Saturday, in spite
of the State anxiety as to the birth-rate, and The
Face appeared framed in green limelight, and Le
Loup howled through a weird tin kazoo in the
distance, and the galvanised corpse sat up and
accused the villain with all the old success—
indeed, with more, for the gallery which
goes to Le Loup has, nowadays, learned to
imitate his noble howl, and works it
off at frequent intervals. The public thus
gets a good deal more howl for its money
than it did before. As regards the acting,
Robt. Inman gives quite a touch of life to Paul
Gouffet, but Willard’s comic make-up as Le
Loup detracts seriously from the horror of his
performance. His working garb as a murderer is
impressive enough, but his make-up as an Italian
chevalier is borrowed from a circus clown, and a
Horror should be a Horror always—not a
ludicrous object and a Horror in turns. When
Harry Diver used to do this sort of work he gave
it an impressiveness by his very sincerity and
consistency. Miss Guildford does as well as
anyone could in a colorless part, and Miss
Ethel Buckley is a fairly spirited humorous
relief. But Bert Bailey’s comic business
is becoming weary and mechanical. Of
course this class of play is not exactly
encouraging to originality, but actors should
make an effort to avoid falling into a rut—for
their own sakes, if not for the sake of the audience.
“The Face at the Window” will cast its green
and sickly horror over the Lyceum for a while yet.
It has achieved a certain popularity, and may yet
become an Institution —like “East Lynne.”

about as good as the good one ; Gregan McMahon
will be the good one, who is no better than the
bad one. Circumstances, however, conspire to
make McMahon appear to live up to a reputation
for owning all the domestic virtues ; chief among
these circumstances is Miss Bronton, who is an
awful aunt this time, instead of a fearful mother-
in-law as hitherto. O. P. Heggie, the Adelaidean,
who did good work formerly in “ The Message

a new patriotic song, is spreading himself upon a
new and gorgeous “first part,” which threatens
to be really different in some respects from other

some sort of a mechanical toy. Meantime, the

THE FLOOD TIDE.
The wondrous tale of Thompson we will won-
deringly sing—
Denny Thompson, known in Chili as the Dotty
Diamond King.
The story has a moral which is very old and
tough :
If the world believes you wealthy it will furnish
you with stuff:
If you’ve not got Thompson’s riches—well, his
name is good enough.
There’s a steamer bound for London, from the
Valparaiso port.
The passengers are mostly of the silent, super,
sort,
But two are lady-spielers, a Mama and Daughter
pair,
Who talk and dream of Thompson, the eccentric
millionaire.
For a secret, worth the keeping, in their mental
safe is stored —
The fact that Denny Thompson, King of Dia-
monds, is aboard.
Now he travels as M‘Naughton, and he roams the
quarter-deck
In a chronic state of liquor, with his boots slung
round his neck,
Until he ends the chapter of his shocking
jamboree
By jumping off the vessel when she’s ploughing
through the sea.
“Lord help him!” says the captain—“he can
get no aid from me.”
Then the younger lady-spieler, with her mother
at her side,
Assumes the rank and station of the Diamond
Monarch’s bride.
Believing him a dead ’un, they dissemble their
belief,
And speak of poor M'Naughton as the fool who
came to grief.
The pair of cute pretenders state that Thompson’s
coming soon
To their swell hotel at Brighton to complete his
honeymoon ;
They revel in expenses, but the landlord doesn’t
kick :
They order gowns and jewels, horses, carriages—
on tick—
Intending, should their creditors grow dubious
and shy,
To gather up the plunder and politely do a guy.
It happens that a stewardess, to save her Dad
from shame,
Conceives another scheme of working Denny
Thompson’s name.
She knows that all his baggage has been sent to
the hotel,
And thinks her own Young Man might pass for
Thompson very well,
Whilst she plays secretary and provides the
common sense,
He’ll need for raising money by this fraudulent
pretence.
So young man Clipps, and Polly, trip to Brighton
right away,
And find the lady spielers are already on tlie lay ;
And each pair knows the other for the biggest
fraud in life,
But silence suits them better than an internecine
strife
’Twixt a bogus Denny Thompson and his bogus
darling wife.
O! the joy of getting credit for whatever you
desire,
When you seem to walk on ether, though your
feet are in the mire !
The ladies—Heaven bless ’em ! —strike a Hebrew
for a loan,
And the masculine impostor makes ten thousand
on his own
By signing an agreement re the floating of his
mine,
And then he buys a racehorse. This is Polly’s
pet design ;
For her father owns a gee-gee who is entered for
a race,
And can win it (if he loses it means “ruin and
disgrace”)
Provided “Thompson’s” purchase isn’t jigging
for the stake.
So “Thompson,” quite unconscious of the risk he
has to take,
Agrees to scratch the favorite for Polly’s father’s
sake,
And the angry mob assaults him till his inmost
feelings ache.
In the meantime Thompson (proper) reappears
upon the scene.
He was fished from out the ocean ere the water
washed him clean ;
His togs are torn and tattered; there are hay-
seeds in the hair
Of that homeless, cashless, friendless, drunken,
dotty millionaire
When he comes to Polly’s father for assistance in
his plight.
Now, “the King’s” return is awkward, so, to keep
him out of sight,
They bid him seek seclusion by the peaceful Eng-
lish lakes,
With his boots upon his shoulders, just to keep
’em free from snakes.
There a villain tries to drown him (’tis the spieler
mother’s plan);
But this purchased desperado is a disappointing
man,
For his night attack on Thompson proves the
silliest of tries;
Himself is left to perish when the Flood Tide
waters rise,
And the other schemers mostly get rewarded for
their Lies.
When Thompson’s mine is floated for a million
pounds or more,
Which is five times what the property is worth,
He offers half the money to the fraudulent vendor
And reckons him his dearest friend on earth.
Thus the sin of wily Polly makes the fortune of
her boy,
And puts her father straight again, of course ;
For the old man’s bitter sorrow was converted
into joy
The day they worked their swindle with the ’orse.
Nor does the spieler daughter ever suffer from
regrets;
She leaves her wicked mother in the lurch —
And the cranky King from Chili duly liquidates
her debts
When she’s booked as Mrs. Thompson by the
church.
Alas ! poor, wicked mother! Of her daughter
now bereft,
Her world seems dark and desolate and cold ;
The other frauds are happy, she’s the only one
that’s left
To expiate the sin—of growing old.

“The Flood Tide,” at Melbourne Royal,

At Melbourne Princess’s the threatened
outbreak of excruciating merriment is happening
in moderation. “ A Stranger in a Strange Land ”
disarms criticism to a great extent by calling itself
a farce, or a laughing show, or an Aid to Hysteria,
or anything but a comedy. People who go to
laugh at this candid caricature of the orthodox
farcical comedy must take a magnanimous sense
of humor with them, and give it a liquid stimu-
lant, or a box of chocolates between the acts. The
alleged misunderstandings in “A Stranger” are
not supported by the least evidence of possibility,
therefore the girls who profess to mistake two
different Indians for a third different Indian, and
the men who say ditto to the girls all the time, are
screamingly funny in a serious way of speaking.
The attempt to make the audience laugh is itself
laughable at times when the endeavor doesn’t
score a legitimate success. And there are other
times when Willoughby and co. manage to give an
appearance of personal drollery to the farce, as a
farce.

Vulcana, likewise Atlas, are filling in a
few farewell nights at Melbourne Opera House.
Jennie Gray is a recent arrival; Mrs. Sims
Reeves, who has moderated her peculiarities, is
somewhat less recent; the other items on the pro-
gramme are pretty well seasoned. Russell, the
ventriloquist, seems to be amassing popularity as
he goes along, and to say this of a professor in his
antique line of business is to crown him with a
wreath of laurels.

Albert Friedenthal, the most popular
pianist of the non-sensational kind who ever
visited Australia, is shortly returning for another
tour. Friedenthal was out here just five years
ago—a quiet, fuzzy-haired artist, with a light
touch and a powerful magnetism. His concerts
were recitals unassisted by any other talent than
his own. Barring a ten minutes interval, he sat
at the piano and played, played, played pretty
well all the time, sometimes taking the encore
without leaving the platform. His one-man
entertainment lasted an hour and three-quarters
or thereabouts, and the audience was always loth
to let him go. It is easy to believe that this un-
pretentious pianist has performed with “astonish-
ing success ” in the biggest cities since he left
Australia. This country had heard nothing of
Albert Friedenthal when he first came, so his
success, under the circumstances, was amazing.

Atlas and Vulcana have left Adelaide
Tivoli, where the two Bells have come in and the
six Empire Girls have begun to give their well-
timed and collective kick. Atlas promoted a
weight-lifting competition among local youths
during his last week. But his speeches to the
audience were somewhat marred when it was
found that any casual reference to Pagel sent him
into a kind of frenzy. As anybody can call out
“Send for Pagel” or similar jests, the spectacle
of an excited Welshman dancing at the footlights
became painfully frequent. At the Royal, the
Majeronis are putting in a fortnight with plays that
are either new or old enough to seem so. The
brothers (one virtuous, one villainous) act easily
and well, and have efficient support from Maie
Nelson (why “Maie”?), Frank Vernon, and others.

1903 .. 45,559 14,518 1050 29,991 81,369
This fund is the nearest approach to a State Life Depart-
ment in Australia. The premiums are paid by the
miners (50 per cent., or 4£d. per week), the mineowners
(25 per cent.) and the State (25 percent.). The benefits
include funeral allowance, accident benefit, and a small
pension to the widow and young children of a miner who
has been killed by mining accident. The expense-rate
is exceedingly low, amounting to only £2 6s. Id. per
cent, of the total income. Part of the expense (office,
secretary, audit, &c.) is, however, borne by the State
without charge to the fund ; but even with this included
the rate would be extremely low, due to the fact that,
every mine workman being a contributor, noth ng goes
in grubbing up business or in collecting contributions.
The fund is administered by a small central board ; but,
as its members are also chiefly M’s.P., they take no fees.
Local committees, which attend to the distribution of
the benefits, are paid small amounts, totalling last year
£914. The accumulated funds in hand (£80,137) consist
of N.S.W. Stock and Treasury Bills £79,000, cash and
bank balances £ll2l, and £l6 in local committees’ hands.
The balance of reserves (£1232) is, as usual, made up of
interest and contributions due bv the Government.
Interest earnings (£2185) are not what they might be
expected to he ; on mean funds they amounted to only
£3 ss. lOd. per cent. Still, the investments are confined
absolutely to State securities.
The Fund is having the same experience as the
English companies had which lately went in heavily for
accident insurance after the passing of the English Em-
ployers’ Liability Act. At the start the workmen felt a
disinclination to go “on the fund,” and after they had
got on they got off with all speed. Very soon, however,
they found out, either that “ on the fund” wasn’t a bad
place to be, or that their employers did not want stiV! ,
limping men about their works; so both the percentage
of men on the fund and the term of disablement have
gradually stretched out. The N.S.W. experience has
been:—
Non-Fatal Average Amount

1901 .. 130-45 £2 2 6
1902 .. .. 146T8 2 5 9
1903 .. .. 164-9 2 8 5
In view of the rapid growth of funds, it has been suggested
that the benefits might be increased, as the Act permits
in certain cases; but the foregoing figures throw cold
water upon any such scheme. And there are other
figures pointing the same way. There are now 89 widows
pensioners of the fund, and there is no telling when they
will cease to be pensioners ; also there are already 28 ex-
miners who have become permanently disabled during
the three years, and who are also life pensioners. There
is a consequent rapid increase in the relief granted per
1000 contributors

Accidents. Fatal accidents.

The benefit in respect of fatal accidents is exclusive of
funeral allowance, which, of course, simply varies from
year to year with the number of fatalities in each year.
It is absolutely certain that it is too early yet to alter
the scale of contributions or benefits. In fact, it is doubt-
ful if a time will ever come when they can be increased.

Notwithstanding that, with three departments
transferred to the Commonwealth, the Owe’See last year
had a revenue of £11,532,133, or over two millions more
than there was five years ago, and notwithstanding that
it also borrowed £3,126,000 apart from what was required
in connection with resumed properties, it still wasn’t
able to spare enough to keep existing works in decent
repair. The Owe’See was so busy providing fidgetty and
hungry constituents with new roads and bridges that the
old ones were allowed to go to rack. Nothing falls to
pieces much faster than a neglected bridge; yet under
this heading, the Owe-See’s officer says in his annual
report—“ No painting was carried out, and many works
(of repail-), which should, for economical reasons, have
been carried out, had to be postponed for want of funds.”
The Government Architect makes the same remark
regarding his branch—a saving had been made “ un-
doubtedly at the expense of a considerable number of
buildings urgently requiring repairs.” How much
revenue would the Owe’See have to get before it would
be able to afford to keep public works in repair ? And
what’s the use of the Government talking of its “very
moderate deficit ” of last year when the “ moderateness”
of it was only achieved by saving the stitch that costs
nine ?
Of the £37,041,785 which the N.S.W. Public
Works Department has spent during the past 15 years,
£21,996,368 has been loan money. Of the £11,906,673
which it has spent during the past three years £9,358,258
has been borrowed. In the 15-year period N.S.W. leaned
up against Bull for 59 per cent, of its public works re-
quirements ; in the past three years for no less than 79
per cent, of them. Even if the money borrowed in con-
nection with the Rocks and other land resumptions is
struck out of the reckoning, 71 per cent, of the expendi-
ture has still come out of loans. And this expenditure,
of course, includes salaries of staff, repairs and upkeep as
well as money spent on new works.

N.S.W. Treasurer Waddell, who seems to be

Australia : over 600 of the tables have now been sold m

orders. It is only natural to expect that such a striking
improvement over all previous machines of similar object,
would speedily attract the attention of tbe minig

Without attempting to follow in detail its Pbenomcn
success, it will only be necessary to state that in the

has all been made at Ferguson’s General Engineering
Works, Footscray, and shipped to Tipton, in Staffordshire

It is rumored that Mt. Lyell (Tas.) No. 1 nest
of smelters is to be permanently closed, with a c °"® e 9Vf' 9 s
shortening of staff and dismissal of hands. A dividend
is probable within a few weeks. The picking-up in shares
is the barometer. The resumption of work at the South
Tharsis and Royal Tharsis flux mines means that there is
not so much ore in the North Lyell as was estimated. If
so, what a howling farce to amalgamate, except that it
gave the opportunity to the Mt. Lyell people to pay a big
cash dividend before the working of its own mine s low-
grade pyrites had eaten a lot of the co.’s liquid assets.

Crown Lyell, after scratching about, intends to

Lyell smelters.

r?Ted or original purchase. If there is any reason
able ground for this cheerful view, it is “up to” the See
Government to pass an Act providing that, after the
purchase money has been paid off, the revenue from the
resumed properties shall form a sinking fund for the re-
demption of other N.S.W. debts; or, if N.S.W. has no
State debts then, that it shall go into a public works
fund. In other words, the surplus, if there is one, should
form a general sinking fund, and be devoted to the re-
purchase of N.S.W. State securities, so long as there are
any to repurchase. In a small matter like this the
Government might as well back its opinion.

After struggling with it for some months the
pneumatic tube between the Sydney Exchange and
the Post Office has been given up as a bad job, and is
no longer in use. But it is still included among the
“permanent and reproductive works” for which the

partment spent £2313 of loan money on it last year alone.

N.S.W. Treasury has called for a return giving
the value of the various buildings and properties belong-
ing to the State, and the amount and cost of insurances
thereon. It is under consideration, remarks this note,
whether the Government should not insure its own pro-
perty in its own insurance fund. (It has cost already
some £5OOO to insure the Government steamer Victoria
alone.) The information is being laboriously collected,
but it remains to be seen whether vested interests will be
strong enough to nip in the bud this move towards a
State Insurance Department. Of course, there is but
one opinion as to whether it would pay the Government
or not; on the available evidence the profits would be
very handsome, indeed.

N.S.W. gets the money to pay its interest from
three principal sources. First, there are the net profits
from railways and from water and sewerage works. If
these are not sufficient, the balance has to be made up
chiefly from taxation. The amount of borrowed money
spent upon railways is 60‘9 per cent, of the whole bor-
rowings ; on water and sewerage, 14T per cent. —together
75 per cent. If, therefore, these water works and railways
meet even their own interest, there would be left only 25
per cent, to be made up through taxation, etc. The fol-
lowing shows what has actually happened during the past
few years:
Paid from Deficiency Percentage
Total Railway and Payable Paid
Interest. Water and S. from Taxa- from
Surplus. tion, &c. Taxation
1899 .. £2,310,771 £1,741,763 £569,008 24‘5
1900 .. 2,369,392 1,821,511 547,881 23T
1901 .. 2,429,982 1,880,807 549,175 22'6
1902.. 2,540,625 1,779,896 760,729 29 9
1903.. 2,746,765 1,412,890 1,333,875 49
Previous to 1899 the deficiency which was payable out o
taxation had reached 37'6 in 1892 ; but from that point
the tendency had t>een gradually downward, and this
improvement continued steadily through 1899,1900, and
1901. Then, however, the effects of the Owe’See’s big
borrowing policy began to show themselves. The
Owe’See alleged that the money was going
into reproductive works; now these figures rise
up and ask the Owe’See for an explanation. In three
years the amount of interest which is not obtained from
the works in which loans are invested, and which conse-
quently has to be made up out of taxation (or borrowings)
has more than doubled. From £547,881 in 1900 it
went to £1,333,875 in 1903. A country that hasn’t any
great natural resources which it can develop at less cost
than that, had better keep quiet about its resources and
try to develop something else that hasn’t so large an
appetite.
* * * *
Queensland local public bodies seem to have
regarded their debts to the Philp Government as just the
same sort of joke as the sugar co.’s did. Eight of them
obtained loans for the construction of tramways; and
only one of them, the Ayr, has kept its interest and
redemption payments going. The others have either not
paid at all or only irregularly. The Douglas shire council
borrowed £31,030 to build a tramway from Port Douglas
to the Mossman River, and now owes £3396 interest and
a lot of instalments on account of principal. Among
them the local bodies owe £12,000 for interest alone ;
and the arrears have latterly been mounting up at an
alarming rate. Several of the lines—the Douglas one,
for instance—serve remarkably rich country ; but, as the
owners won’t tax themselves sufficiently to keep the
accounts square, there has been nothing for it but for the
Morgan-Browne Government to point to the clause which
gives power to strike a special rate to wipe out the debt,
and to notify that that power will be used unless the bill
is paid.
* * * •
On the basis of population S. Australia is now
borrowing more rapidly than any other State except
Westralia, which is, in this matter, an apparently in-
curable lunatic. In the past four months £472,800 of
a per cent. Treasury bills have been successfully hawked
in Adelaide, and authority still exists to hawk £693,300
more. S. Australia has a population of only 367,000, so
in four months it has added £1 6s. per head to its
already crushing debt. For some years S. Australia and
Queensland were running almost neck and neck in the
race for the Biggest Debt on Earth ; but the southern
state now looks like an easy winner. In 1891 Queensland’s
total per head was £73125. 5d.; S.A.’s was then £62 9s. lid.
Ten years later, Queensland, through its increase of
population and only moderate borrowings, meanwhile
had reduced its debt per head by 11s. 3d.—to £73 Is. 2d.
South Australia, on the other hand, put up its debt by
£lO 7s.—to £72 16s. Ud. Its 10-year record was thus
£lO 18s. 3d. worse than Queensland’s. Philp’s heavy and
persistent borrowings in his later days gave Queens-
land an increased lead again ; in 1902 its total
was £76 Bs. 6d. per head, as against South Aus-
tralia’s £75 2s. lOd. As Queensland’s borrowings
have, however, now practically ceased, while South
Australia’s are going ahead with all the energy
that a premier expert in canvassing for small
orders can command ; and as, moreover, the
South Australian population is increasing much less
rapidly than that of Queensland, it is just about
certain that the southern State will own per head at the
end of 1903-4 the Biggest Debt on Earth. Whether Bull
Cohen will view this possession as much of an asset when
the State approaches him for the renewal of £6,250,000,
as it will have to do before the end of 1909, remains to
be seen. A debt of very nearly £l7 per head falling due
within the next five years would make a more responsible
Premier than Jenkins feel mighty uncomfortable

Sydney. It has branded itself “ The 20s. Gift, Ltd., and
is alleged to be doing a great business. The Catfirsti sells
Brown a book of five tickets for ss. Brown sells these
tickets for Is. each. The five people who buy them take
their tickets to Cat, Ltd., and for 4s. each they get also
each a book of tickets. Brown may then call on Oat,
Ltd., and receive 18s.-£l, less the Cat’s commission of
10 per cent. The same process goes on in each case.
When Smith, one of Brown’s customers, sells his five
tickets, and those five ticket-holders buy books for them-
selves at 4s. each, then Smith also can get £1 (less 10 per
cent.) at the Cattery. It seems a ridiculously easy way ot
“ earning ”£1 (less 10 per cent.). All the time, of course,
the Cat, Ltd.’s liability is mounting up. By the time the
sixth round is reached there will be 15,625 tickets out,
and the animal may be called upon to (less 10
per cent.) to the holders of the 3125 tickets of the fifth
round. Also it will already have paid over £7OO to the
holders of tickets in the first, second, third and fourth
rounds. Grave doubts have been expressed as to its
ability to do it. There is, however, no need to worry on
that score. This isn’t a game that will kill the Cat. lhe
Oat doesn’t have to pay any Brown or other individual
his £1 (less 10 per cent.) until his five victims have lodged
4s. each, or £1 in all. If four lodge 4s. each, and the
fifth doesn’t, then Brown doesn’t get any £1 at all; and
the Oat scores. Even if the five come in, the Cat still rakes
in 10 per cent.—it receives £1 and pays 18s. So long as
people can pass their tickets on, the Cat will only earn
10 per cent. ; hut when the end arrives and the holders
can’t get victims, then the Cat will score heavily. When
the 15,625 tickets are out, the Cat won’t have to P a y the
£3125 (less 10 per cent, which reduces it 10s.)
which they represent until it has been rushed for 78,125
tickets. No man gets his £1 until, through him, first hve
and then a further 25 others have joined in the gamble.
When a man buys five tickets for 4s. and can’t sell them,
then the Cat scores 45., and the man who sold this
other man his original ticket gets no £l. The chances of
missing the £1 are, in fact, so tremendous, while the
Oat stands absolutely on velvet all the time, that only a
very venturesome fool will touch the gamble. It is a
pity there isn’t a law to suppress this utterly useless
business, which is simply another method of preying
upon the producers of the community without giving an
atom of return, but for the present there doesn’t seem to
be. „ „
Sydney city treasurer gives a warning to those
person's with money invested in the liquor trade. Dis-
cussing the collection of city rates he writes . the
ratepayers, as a whole, have cheerfully fulfilled their
obligations, especially in business circles, other than
hotelkeepers ; these, as a class, are certainly in a bad
way, but whether it is because of one year s want of
trade or the accumulation of many struggles against
their environment Ido not venture to say. In my
capacity as city treasurer, I consider it part of my
duty to go very deeply into matters which affect tne
city’s bank balance. In this respect there have been
so many publicans applying for extension of tune to
pay their rates, and in very many instances the evi-
dences which have come personally before me of finan-
cial struggle have been so strongly proven, I am
convinced that there is an underlying influence other
than actual want of trade. The question is not for
me to solve. There are nearly 400 hotels in Sydney.
Is the number too great for the accommodation of
the people ? Is this a class of business which is not
fairly distributed, or are there conditions surrounding
a publican’s obligations which are not contained
amongst the liabilities of any other class of business ?
The fact seems to be that there is far more money sunk
in the liquor trade than can earn a decent return.
During the last few years, in order to “tie” houses
more thoroughly, the brewing co.’s have urged publicans
into a building programme of a bloated and Owe bulli-
vanesque character. There is really not the money in the
business to pay interest on these buildings, and on
brewery shares, and to allow the hotel-keeper a decent
living. , , , .
The extraordinary sequel to Col. Templeton’s
lone-drawn-out liquidation of the Melbourne Premier
Permanent Building Society threatens to provoke an
official inquiry into Its why and wherefore. Seems that
the end of the liquidation was only the beginning of legal
proceedings for the recovery of some ancient land boom
debts which Templeton set down as worthless so far as
creditors of the old society were concerned They were
sold at auction for £67 prior to the closing of the books,
the purchaser being one Taylor, who had acted as clerk
to the liquidator during 14 years of winding-up the
estate Now that Taylor is issuing writs against those
old debtors for the recovery of items ranging from about
a quarter of a million sterling to a few paltry thousands,
the question arises as to whether said Taylor can
possibly have bought a gold-mine for £6l. If it is good
enough for him, the ex-assistant liquidator, to squeeze
the old debtors in this way, how came it that Col. Temple-
ton left any blood in their liabilities before putting them
up to auction ? There is a fair case for an Insolvency
Court inquiry into the reason of this belated “ squeeze
Does accountant Taylor know that the nominal £700,000
of debts sold to him at auction are worth a lot more than
£67, and if Taylor knows it why didn’t liquidator Temple-
ton know it, and act accordingly ?

Envy hatred, and malice are raging in the
Stock Exchange of Melbourne over the new Board of
Works loan. One broker started off the mark early and
persuaded Fitzgibbon and his weaklings of the Board to
entrust him with the underwriting of the loan on terms
that set the mouth of every pawnshop owner watering—
a per cent, commission for getting other people to put
up money on practically a4J per cent, issue. Then came
the storm. First it was over a special quarter per cent,
allowance out of this com. This was fought out at a little
meeting of the broking syndicate which acts with the origi-
nator of the underwriting scheme. To his credit he held
on like grim death to the quarter, and, it is whispered,
got his way. Then, in the outside broking circle, a per-
fect hurricane raged over the whole loan. As the market
slumped the underwriter laughed, knowing that each
relapse was an obstacle out of his way, for the weaker the
market the more justified was the minimum of £9B. All
the howling against him, however, meant nothing. The
only way he could be countered was by the forming of a
rival syndicate to offer better terms But he had yarded
in all the big fry, and got the ears of the banks. So he
will score another triumph, and the ratepayers of the
metropolitan area will suffer.
Baker’s Creek, Hillgrove (N.S.W. ), last clean
up for a fortnight’s run was 150 oz. Manager SPGeorge
on this closed the battery till he heard from the directors
in Adelaide. Since then work has been resumed, but
with fewer hands. The manager is now developing the
lower levels ; if results are favorable, work will be re-
sumed as of yore. Tributors are, however, notified that
tributes will be let on the following terms : If stone
averages , sdwt. per ton ; loz., lOdwt., increasing
sdwt. for every ioz. Tributors who know what these
terms mean are keeping aloof, and talk of calling an
indignation meeting. All the same, many will take what
is offered. „

The rich chutes worked in former days by
Baker’9 Creek have gone into the New Hillgrove Pro-
Erietary Co.’s ground. This co., since reconstruction,
as done a lot of developing work by shaft sinking,
tunnelling, winzes, etc. The battery is practically com-
pleted, and will possibly start the middle of this month
and crush stone on hand. While this is being done, a
large air-compressor on hand will be erected. The erection
of the battery has dragged terribly. Scrip is locally held
tightly. At Hill grove, it is believed that a bear
crowd in Sydney doesn’t want the battery to start till it
can get all loose scrip from small holders. One local man
is said to hold 14,000 shares. The crushing should be
good, but the mine can never pay big divs., being over-
capitalised. Everyone in the place is promised a job
when the battery starts; many will be disappointed.
The place is overrun with city cadets seeking “practical
experience.” , * •
Eleanora mine (Hillgrove, N.S.W.) is now a
dilapidated wreck underground. Stopes have been
rooted all ways, and many of the levels are more or
less filled up with mullock. A local attempt made to
cyanide the tailings was a bad failure ; and the Australian
Gold Mining Co. has now the job on hand. The tailings
are averaging nearly 7dwt. to the ton. Last clean-up
from Eleanora vats, 2447 tons, yielded £1165 worth of
gold, and clean-up not complete.
Sunlight (Hillgrove, N.S.W.) is being worked
by tributors, who are making a good thing for the co.
and about wages for themselves.

«' M.C.” : Think there has been a miscalculation
with regard to the unprofitableness of handling B.H.
South Blocks ore (B. 25/2/ 04). Lead ore assaying 25 per
cent, with 4oz. silver per ton could be carted to one ot
the concentrating mills for, say, 2s. per ton. Most of the
Broken Hill co.’s are mining 15 per cent, lead ore with
lOoz. silver at a mining charge, exclusive of stores,
management, &c., of 10s. lOd. and upwards per ton.
The mill saves two-thirds of the lead (or 10 units), and
about half the silver (or about soz) ; intrinsic value (lead
at £lO, silver 2s. 6d.) 325. 6d. On the same basis of re-
covery, South Blocks ore would return 16 units of lead
with 2oz. of silver ; value, 375. Any of the co. s could co
better by buying South Blocks ore for 10s. per ton than
by mining relatively poorer ore. Notwithstanding this,
the South Blocks could not mine and crush its own ore to
advantage, nor could it mine and sell ore to another
co. at a profit. The whole secret of profit is economic
mining, and that the South Blocks is not down to as yet.
One other thing is certain : the South Blocks will not
require a concentrating plant for a long time to come.
The very worst thing that could happen would be an
imitation of the policy of the northern group of mines—
of a wasteful depletion of ore. Prospecting (for it is
nothing else at present) may disclose some ore good
enough to send direct to the smelter ; the shallow levels
have provided some surprises of that nature at Broken
Hill. Oxidised ore, rich in lead and valuable as a flux,
can, as a rule, be cheaply mined. A big find of such ore
would give the co. a lift. There is just the hope, perhaps
not a very big one, that “something may turn up, or
lead “ take a permanent jump.”
“ Sessil ” : Copeland (N.S.W.) mining field has
given a kick or two lately. It originally got a bad name
owing to the wiles of the untamed pussy, while of later
years the trail of the cocky miner has been over it. The
district is full cf lodes of varying promise, on one of the
biggest of which a number of parties have pegged out
above the Bowman River. A fair amount of work has
been done, and the reef, from 1 to sft., affords the most
promising development the field has seen for years. The
Upper Gloucester syndicate has a big body of fair grade
stone, which has averaged from 15dwt. to Joz. The lode is
proved to 250 ft. and is widening. Co. has a mile of tram,
way from paddock to water-wheel, and batter y of 5 head#
Pleasing feature of whole field is the available water
power. Jas. Irwin—who took £30,000 as a shareholder
from the Mountain Maid years ago—is back and about to
tackle the old lady once more. The Homeward Bound is
producing fair stone again; the Hidden Treasure has
crushed l2£ tons for an average of 4ioz. ; Grant and
party in the old Mint have raised several tons of very
rich stone ; the Prince Charlie has struck the old reef
100 ft. below old workings (same reef went from 15
weights upwards in the old days). So Copeland looks
like”reviving. Its great attractions : accessibility, cheap-
ness of provisions and splendid water-supply, and a
dimate. .

Mine-manager Sansom has left the Birthday
Tunnel, Berringa (Vic.). His successor is Hansen, of one
of the Bamganie shows. The two fields are most distinct
in natural features. At Berringa the lode formations are
wide and tremendously faulted, whereas at Bamganie
the lodes are narrow, and have not been proved to live
down. Meanwhile Tunnels find few sellers and fewer

The London-owned Duke United, Maryborough
(Vic ) after struggling for twelve months to make ends
meet and pay a quarterly 6d. dividend, has met better
ground, a patch of rich wash having been struck south of
the shaft and west of Sam Body’s old workings. As the
wash is making awav due west everyone is thinking that
it is a tributary of the Duke lead. Pinder, the manager,
accordingly has pegged out 8000 ft. of ground to the
south-west. The wash in the new ground is so close to
the old workings that it is a wonder it ever was missed.
Said that specks of gold show in it, so it is good dirt.
Pinder says there is 4000 fathoms drained ready for the
puddlers. This is not a big block ; but, if the dirt is rich,
it will sweeten up other ground north. W. A. Goldfields
people in London, who own the mine, sent a little fellow
named Jeffery out to control the Duke United, but he
struck snags everywhere—especially the Baillieu crowd—
and went back to London. Pinder then came out. He
is making a good fist of matters. W.A. Goldfields
(Wetherell and Stoneham) must be offering up prayers of
thankfulness in London atPinder’s success, as the W.A.G.
has had a hard row to hoe for many a day. Divs. from
any of their promotions will come in handy just now.
Bewick, Moreingand Co., too, will be duly appreciative
at the removal of an alluvial lame duck from the London
market just when they are preaching investment in deep-
lead # • •
The Main Leads North (Vic.) affair is not quite
settled. Out of the secret reserve of 3290 z. the directors
have appropriated 200 oz. for the purposes of a dividend.
Just work out the position for their benefit. The reserve
has been in existence while the co. had an overdraft. It
was in existence when shares were down to 6s. and when
people were quitting for fear of calls. What will these
unfortunates say 7—indeed, what is their legal position ?
M‘Crorey’s supporter, Hain, has shaken the dust of the
board off his feet, leaving the Harvey party triumphant.
Hick, who takes his place, ought to be an acquisition,
although it is not quite clear that his early training on
the Chalk’s qualifies him to perceive the full responsi-
bilities of a director. Public opinion is making it very
apparent that directors have to live up to their position
or their co. must go to the wall. Better yields are coming
from the mine, but the hojie of a lively market is not
great. M'Crorey must have some shares left, and people
don’t want to buy till he is out. He is not likely to tell
the other side when he is done.

New Dempsey, Gaffney’s Creek (Vie.), is
pretty well out of the market. The last dividend had to

Turned up lately, in a Melbourne court, a
reminder of the little Jook’s visit to Australia,
some time last century—or was it the year before
that ?—in the shape of a German sausage-maker,
who handed to the Bench a document from
Government House, stating that Hans’ sausages
were as filling and soothing to the stomach as the
British article, and that little York had much
enjoyed them. As the testimonial got Hans out
of a little difficulty about being on a strange
person’s premises, at least one man is grateful for
his Royal Nibs’ visit and his liking for the
mysterious edible that can’t be whistled to with
impunity.
DIPLOMACY.

“ Chass: Watched the fire-fighters at a
recent Ballarat fire. The railway men under the
stationmaster’s guidance ran out the railway hose
with lightning speed, and in a brace of shakes a
red-coated fireman was on the roof of a neighbor-
ing house with his squirt pointed at a blazing
window. But he had not calculated on Tommy
Bents economy, neither had the crowd. An
official turned on the pressure water, and in
a twinkling 50 jets were playing on the crowd
instead of on the fire ; while the rush of water
through the biggest rent in the hose knocked a
youth flat on his back. The crowd’s ironical
jeering of the railway hose and Tommy Bent
prepare one for the thud about June next.

The Victorian honorary magistrate is a
wonderful character in his small way. Lately at
Prahran (Melbourne), two factory inspectors
prosecuted a jam-maker on a charge of having a
loathsome and unclean factory. This was some of
the evidence:—
Thomas Powell, inspector of factories, stated that in
company with Miss Mead, inspectress of factories, he, on
19th ult., visited defendants’ business premises. They
were in a very dirty condition. In the canning, pickling
and pulping rooms there was a great deal of slush. Girls
stood in the filth—pulp, dirt and other matter. In the
pulping room four girls were standing in liquid matter an
inch and a half deep. The manager, Mr. Palfryman
shook his head, admitted that it was “ pretty had,'” and
Slid he would have it altered. On the stairs leading to
the dining-room there was filth ; in the dining-room
i'self it was impossible to see the floor on account of the
dirt. There was a bad smell in the pickling room.
That was a pretty good case, but suddenly the
chief J.P. began to give evidence from the bench.
He said that, at the invitation of the factory
manager, he had visited the place and found it
beautifully clean. Which he naturally would do ;
even the manager of the dirtiest factory would’
clean it up before in viting his friend, the J.P., to
come and look at it in order to influence him
in a forthcoming trial. The case was dismissed
by reason of the evidence given by the Bench to
itself when it wasn’t on oath. At latest Chief
Sec. Gillott was intending to carry this matter
further, so something unpleasant may happen to
the J.P. ; but nothing that may occur to him is
likely to be half as sudden as it ought to be. A
J.P. who, apparently, allows himself to be pri-
vately interviewed by a defendant on whose case
he is to adjudicate, ought to be struck off the roll
without further notice, and if a charge of mal-
feasance of justice will lie it ought to be thrown
at him without delay.

Woman is gradually emerging from serf-
dom. In the divorce court at Sydney, a few days
ago, a lady obtained a decree nisi on the ground
t lat her husband did not support her, that he
treated her with contumely and tore her clothes,
and that he used to burn her hair-brush in the
middle of the starry night, and wake her by
holding the flaming implement in her face. Tin's
not only terrified her, but also left her without
the means of doing 1 her back-hair in the morning.
On top of his other misdeeds, he demanded that
she should cut his toe-nails, and when she
declined to abase herself he used to kick her with
the uncut nails in bed. The Judge’s decision has
at least one definite, good effect. Woman may
now consider that she is not bound to prostrate
herself before a partially undressed husband and
cut his toe - nails. In Japan woman is still a
crushed being who only feeds with her husband
by his lordly permission, and who walks behind
him, and rushes to open the door for him ; but the
Jap may keep that social system for his own
consumption.

Australia will never be seriously concerned

away. The loss of 1000 families is worse than a
decrease in the birth-rate, yet the sort of people
who would follow so thin an impostor as Dowie
are not much loss. A thousand families of pro-
bable idiots are not a very valuable asset.

The A.N.A. board of
directors in Westralia recently
considered the advisability of
celebrating the jubilee' of
Eureka, occurring next De-
cember. Among the metro-
politan representatives, mostly
civil servants and importers’
clerks, the proposal failed to
find a seconder. On the e-old-
• ” wii uuc- gvma- 1
fields men held different views,
however, and out-voted the coastal
board members, thus committing the
body in Westralia to organise a
national Australian demonstration to
commemorate rebel Peter Lalor.
A minor collision between Sydney ferry
steamers, just investigated by the Marine Court,
resulted in astern reprimand to one of the masters
involved. The skipper had left the wheel while
he collected passengers’ fares. The only available
person to take the wheel was the raw deck hand
and another steamer popping out in front of him!
the boy lost his head and was run down. Now, if
the master does not collect the fares he is sacked ;
the ferry owners say they can’t afford another
system of collecting fares, so the fault is wholly
theirs. Yet nothing was said to them by the
comfc, which rested satisfied with threatening 1 the
luckless master with the loss of his ticket if he
came up again with a similar explanation. It is
a pity that the court doesn’t find itself struck by a
peremptory command to be in two places at a
time under pain of losing its billet if it isn’t there.
1 hen the court might be more reasonable. The
court is so slow that it takes it all it knows to be
in one place at a time. Sometimes it doesn’t
manage that, and often it is no use when it is
there—and not much ornament.
Sometimes, it seems, the Australian is too
modest to become a hero. While at a picnic a
young girl fell out of a boat on the Macquarie
River (N.S.W.), and was allowed to drown in full
view .of a crowd of young men and women.
Questioned afterwards, some of the young fellows
said that they were not good swimmers ; others
said they could swim, but “did not like undressing
in the presence of so many young ladies.”

N.S.W. officialdom has mixed itself up
over the Shaftesbury Reformatory for Girls, at
South Head. For economical and other reasons
it was recently deemed fit to close this old estab-
lishment, and it was so closed under the hand of
John See—at least, so John See imagined. The
inmates were removed to other institutions. The
furniture and fixings were handed over to the
departments that could best use them. The tele-
phone was cut off. The staff was appointed else-
where—except the matron, who was left “on
leave of absence,” until something could be found
for her, in charge of the building. Just when
everything was fixed up, a back-blocks magistrate
committed a girl thief to Shaftesbury. He had
heard nothing of the closing of the place.
Neither had the constable, who duly handed the
girl over to the matron, and she, though Shaftes-
bury was legally non-existent, took her in. She
could hardly do anything else. Here was a
situation ! The girl was not in Shaftesbury Re-
formatory, as that institution was wiped out. But
the law had committed her there, and, as a matter
of fact, there she was. The Crown Law office
people were appealed to in vain. So John See,
after proving to the satisfaction of himself that
the youngster was not really in Shaftesbury,
solved the difficulty by getting an order-in-Counci I
to take her out of it. Just when everyone had
sighed with relief at settling the question, word
was received that another girl, committed by
another up-country magistrate, had arrived safe
and sound at South Head. Then John See fled

It seems that Melbourne in general had
been looking at certain Mutoscope pictures with
an undiscerning eye. As far as the public could
judge from penny peeps, the Mutoscopes failed to
fulfil their promise of impropriety. “Why
Marie Blew the Light Out” was a bitter disap-
pointment; “The Temptation of St. Anthony”
didn’t go near to realising the worst hopes of a
sinful city. Melbourne, in fact, considered the
Mutoscope Co. rather guilty of obtaining pennies
under false pretences until a local detective seized
Marie the light-blower, and Tony the tempted,
and proved their obscenity to the satisfaction of
Panton, P.M., and other magistrates at the City
Court. One ordinary-minded “beak” couldn’t see
where the obscenity came in, but his opinion was
over-ruled by the Pantonic purists. A fine of £lO
was imposed upon the occupier of the premises
where Marie blew the light out, and Marie now
remains in the hands of the police pending an
appeal against Panton’s decision. Should that
decision be upset on appeal, Melbourne will
resume its original grievance against the Muto-
scope, but if the verdict of Panton is confirmed,
Public Morality will merely bewail the fact that
it was shockingly outraged without knowing it.

Kronheimer, the Hebrew gentleman who
offered £5OOO for the establishment of a consump-
tive wing at any of the Victorian hospitals, still
continues to get a good deal of fame out of “his
most generous donation.” At present the Kron-
heimer placard is hung on a picturesque dispute
between the committee of the Austin Hospital
and Tommy Bent. The Austin Hospital wants to
get the £5OOO and build a new wing for the treat-
ment of consumptives. Before he will give his
consent, Bent wants a guarantee that when the
wing is erected the Austin Hospital won’t come
at the Government for additional maintenance
grants. The wrangle has been going on for six
months, and it is getting on to Bent’s nerves—or,
at any rate, on to his meat. In an outburst of
anger he told the committee that Kronheimer’s
gift was more bother than it was worth, and that
Kronheimer had only given the money in order
to .obtain a sort of permanent advertisement.
VhiE aroused the Argus to indignation, and a
leader appeared taking Bent to task severely for
the gruffness of his language. The writer heaved
a bit of Shakspeare at Tommy, who replied in
kind, asking, “Shall quips and sentences, and
these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from
the humor of his career?” Bent quoting Shaks-
peare is like a pork butcher making sweet music
in the slaughter-yard.
NOT A CUSTOM HERE.

Judging by the frenzied appeals that Zion
is making for money, it seems as if Dowie might
get back to his muddy Paradise in Illinois to find
his church in liquidation. The cry which the
“Overseer-in-Charge” has issued to the Zionists
is to the general effect that the Cause is almost up
a tree and can’t pay its bills, and that unless the
Zionists hand over 20 per cent, of their earnings
to keep Dowie’s bloated speculation going, it is
impossible to say what may happen. The Bulle-
tin hopes it will be present to hear Dowie orate
the night Zion bursts. The language of that
short, thick man is terrible on very ordinary
occasions, but his shriek in presence of a really
large calamity should be an effort calculated to
turn a bullock-driver green with envy.

An unusual tale of prison repentance comes
from Westralia. Some months ago a thief, one
Abbott, got three years for stealing £2OO, which
he hid before capture and which remained undis-
covered. Recently the prosecutor died and left
his family in poverty. On the facts being made
known to the prisoner he volunteered to give up
the money, and led the police to King’s Park,
where the coin was unearthed from the foot of
the Soldiers’ Memorial. The usual prison repen-
tance is mostly a cheap one, but this seems
genuine. N.B.—Note that the stolen money was
naturally planted in the congenial company of the
Soldiers’ Memorial.

A Melbourne pickpocket who tried to loot
a gorgeous Chow of his trinkets fell in badly. Ah
Sam was parading Little Bourke-street with a
noble walking-stick, a diamond-set scarf pin, a
huge gold dog-chain and other jewels, when a man
pounced upon him, to find that the wily Chinee
had his jewellery sewn on to his clothes and
protected by an array of fish-hooks. The would-
be thief had his hand cut and his head broken
with the stick; and that was all his gain.

Methodist Church in N.S.W. at last
Conference showed a hankering after “en-
richment of service.” It wants to put on
ruffles and lace and knee-breeches, and
ritual, and have trills in its church music.
So progresses the evolution of all religions.
A religion starts with a preacher of wild,
hairy legs and fanatical zeal, who foams at
the mouth as he talks and sees visions as he
sleeps. Such a preacher tells of the joys of
the next world and inveighs against the
luxuries and the sins of this, and many
people follow him, either because they
haven’t a fair share of the luxuries and sins
and hope to even up things in the Hereafter,
or because they have had too much luxury
and sin and, their stomachs having gone
back on them, austerity promises a wel-
come change. That is the beginning of a
church. But by-and-by the novelty of the
thing wears off, and the original prophet is
succeeded by men who foam in a perfunctory
way, and the live frenzy of religion is suc-
ceeded by the cold, dead woodenness of
theology. Then the church drifts back to
the worldly path, and reckons that, after
all, it is best to make the most of this
world. And, to provide some substitute
for the old zeal, and the vanished hairy
legs, and the foam that has disappeared
from the smooth countenance of the plump
preacher, the church ventures on ritual arid
vestments and glittering music. Consider
the Scotchbyterianism of the wild moor
men of Scotland in the 17th century and
the Presbyterianism of Dill Macky’s ele-
gant knee breeches and lace ruffles 1 Con-
sider even—to take a creed with a much
shorter career—the Salvationism of 20 or
30 years ago as compared with the glossy
bell-topper of Booth to-day 1
H.M.S. Rapid is being paid off, having
been at last condemned as not class enough for
even an Australian warship; and so has been
lying in Farm Cove during the week flying the
“Paying-off whip.” This piece of Naval tom-
foolery consists of an immensely long narrow
white ribbon, which flies from the main topmast
far over the vessel’s stern and finally dabbles in the
water. While some distinctive signal was, no
doubt, thought necessary at Portsmouth and else-
where, in days gone by, when a crew was getting
its arrears of pay, a vital matter to many on shore,
the only excuse for clinging to the whip, to-day,
is the conservative nature of the navy, wherever
it is able to hang on to its foolishnesses.

The other day a Townsville (Q.) hospital
took in a Chinaman suffering from two wounds in-
flicted by balls from a pea-rifle. It was alleged
in the police court that one European youth had
said to another—“lt’s a dull day; let’s go and
shoot a Chinaman !’’ John himself averred that
the enterprising pair had demanded pineapples or
blood, and had shot at him promptly on his
, refusal to part with the fruit. The contiguity of
Asiatic aliens breeds a strange moral tone in
surrounding Caucasians.
The poor old hoss who puts in a hard life-
time pulling around a lorry, and looks forward to
an old age pension in the shape of a peaceful time
in a grassy paddock, is denied even that much
pleasure before departing from this weary life.

The advent of the somewhat democratic
Morgan-Browne Ministry has had at least one
satisfactory result up
North. Under the Con-
tinuous Ministry every
black-and-tan alien who
could borrow or steal a £lO
note got a hawker’s license
without demur. Now Ab-
dul Hooshta or Ram Bosh
has to be naturalised by
the Australian Govern-
ment before the local
C.P.S. will look at his
greasy tenner, and the pro-
cess is a slow one. As
a result, the white hawker
gets a fair chance, and
the new regime is cursed
in Siamese and Cochin
China, and Brahmapootra
and Mahunuddy, and all
manner of tea-chest lingo.

Bent’s railways (strictly so-called) possess
some oddities with great possibilities about them.
From Essendon to Broad meadows runs a short
train drawn by a loco, which looks like a pony.
One man stokes, drives, and looks after the road,
and is captain and crew all in one. From Colac
to Beeac a twelve-mile run is made by a “ Shang-
hai ” engine—no guard, the driver in sole charge ;
no lights provided in the carriage, and all book-
ing done at Colac. On the N.E. line a goods train
with a passenger ear leaves Essendon on Sunday
nights. The passenger car was built in England,
and imported by the Hobson’s Bay railway com-
pany. Bent dug this curiosity up, dusted it,
chipped off the rust, and it keeps upright.

“ H.” from Victoria :
Re Australian history for Australian schools (B. 6/2/’O4),
why also should children here read absurd verses on
English weather? InaMallee school, on a hot-wind day,
with the thermometer at 107, I have heard perspiring
infants repeat:—
“ The north wind doth blow, and we shall have snow,
And what will the swallow do then, poor thing?
Oh, do you not know, he i 3 gone long ago
To a country much warmer than ours, poor thing.”
N.S.W. Arbitration Court has decided
that it will not enforce the payment of levies
imposed for the purpose of carrying on strikes,
but may for lock-outs. The point was determined
in connection with the coal-mining trouble in
Victoria; the N.S.W. unions are helping the
men who are locked out.

John Davidson in Macmillan’s Magazine
on the Canadian prohibition town, Fredericton :
Whisky is sold as openly as tea. There is regular, and
apparently adequate provision for domestic drinking.
There are fifteen or sixteen places where drink is usually
sold and it can be obtained without any formalities. The
regular dealers, who are well known, are fifteen or sixteen
in number. They include all the druggists, most of the
hotels and billiard saloons, and some places that make
hardly any pretence of doing any other business. It is
all conducted in a perfectly straightforward way. The
worst effect is that the system has given rise to a large
amount of drinking among young boys of sixteen and
eighteen. No one can question what a boy is doing in a
druggist’s at the soda-water fountain. A lad of that
age would not dare to enter a saloon, except by stealth ;
but he can boldly drink in the most public way at the
soda fountain.
Prohibition thus doesn’t prohibit, though it checks
disorderly drunkenness; but, as a set-off to that,
It encourages juvenile drinking.
A letter from Longstaff shows what a
hollow fraud King-painting is. Longstaff, it
turns out, didn’t have a single sitting from his
subject until after he had painted the picture for
which ex-Gov. Beauchamp gave him a com-
mission, and which is intended for Sydney Art
Gallery. Even then he didn’t have a real sitting.
He took the painted and framed picture to
Buckingham Palace, the King rushed in, looked
at it, and said that the orders on the breast were
not quite right:—
I explained to him that I had not seen them, so conse-
quently could hardly be expected to paint them correctly.
The King* then turned to his equerry and instructed him
to “ send Mr. to me at once.” This latter individual
came immediately, bowing low. The King then asked
me what I would like. I told him that I wanted the gold
chain, the four orders worn on the breast, the sash, also
an elaborate gold chain worn round the neck, with an
enamel Maltese cross. The King, addressing the official,
said : “Get those for Mr. Longstaff at once.” Turning
to me, he said, “ Where would you like them ? ” to which
I replied, “At my studio.” The King said, “ Oh, very
well; be careful of them, and let me have them back
safely by Saturday.” He also gave orders for me to take
his military boots and spurs, and field-marshal’s hat.
So a picture of a king consists of an accurate
representation of gold chains, sashes, orders,
enamel crosses, military boots, spurs, and hat;
the man inside all this furniture doesn’t count.
The artist may draw upon his imagination and his
“ loyalty ” for that trifling detail. There are no
warts on the trimmings ; there may be on the one
that wears them. And kings, unlike Cromwells,
are not painted with warts.

“D.” :Be death traps. Many a church
has a large wooden screen erected inside the
door; this would, in case of fire panic, be imme-
diately swept against the opening, thus blocking
all egress. St. Mary’s Cathedral is a case in
point—one out of a multitude.
THE TEST MATCH OF THE FUTURE.
The future Australian team, if the pro-Chinese.
Indian-Kanaka crowds get their way. On a distant
hill a small object appears (a telescopic view of
which is given). This is the last white Australian
come from his mountain fastness to see what the
score is.
Trial Bay (N.S.W.) prison buildings, now
deserted, might surely be traded off to some
religious sect—some prophet or other who
could take his flock there and form a colony.
The prison cells are specially suited for religious
hermits; there is no township near to push its
lusts and vanities under the noses of the saints;
and the prison authorities might throw in some
rusty leg-irons, so that, any refractory adherent
could be chained up in a dark cellar or a tank.
As a working plant for a new religion Trial Bay
building has many good points.

A single issue of 141 N.S.W. newspapers
contained, according to the Royal Commission on
the birth-rate, 445 advertisements about how to
prevent this country’s essential infant. And
these papers used to claim, and most of them still
claim, that they should go free through the post
as public educators.

VVTien wake the dead on Resurrection morn,
And stir at sound of Gabriel’s golden horn,

Still in my arms, dream that it is not dawn.
Dream on, nor rise and leave me all forlorn,
For whom no life in heaven will then be born ;
Your fair white face by mine lie still and proud,
When the dead wake.
So shall we lie beneath some poppied lawn
And, smiling in our sleep, hold heaven in scorn.
We, who for all eternity are vowed,
Will stay behind the skyward-speeding crowd
And rouse but just enough to kiss and yawn
When the dead wake

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, March 15, 1904.
My Dear Arini,—
An interesting marriage-to-come announcement
is that of Staff-surgeon Chaworth Louis Nolan,
R.N., son of the late Dr. Andrew Nolan, of
Wicklow, Ireland, and Miss Helen Darley, of
Enniskerry, in the same county—-a niece of Chief
Justice Darley of N.S. Wales. Surgeon Nolan is
a nephew of William Saurin Lyster, of Australian
operatic fame. The latter was a son of Captain
Chaworth Lyster, and a godson of William Saurin,
a famous Attorney-General for Ireland. The
bride’s grandfather was also a lawyer, holding a
high office in the Court of Chancery in Ireland.
Lady Rawson’s galah parrot has not been re-
covered, in spite of the £5 reward. Mr. Share,
p.-s., and Mr. Robertson Clarke have got so used
to looking upward into tree-tops for the fowl that
they have acquired quite a devotional cast of eye.
They have, it is rumored on the worst authority,
climbed every tree in Rose Bay, spoiled £l5
worth of clothes, used £5 worth of language, and
finally, in desperation, think of asking the
Attorney-General for a search-warrant against
every person who has a tree on his premises where
a galah might be secreted. The bird did not talk,
I’m told, and it could not sing, and galahs are not
pretty, so why did Lady Rawson love it ? Perhaps
it was good, and had a sweet disposition. I saw
a galah, the other day, in Dutchy’s Monkey Shop,
at the Circular Quay end of George-street, which
I believe was the missing fowl. It had a down-
ward expression, evidently acquired through long
consideration of searching aides-de-camps from
tall trees, and it looked down at the same angle
at which the aides now habitually look up, which
is conclusive.
The Japanese Consul in Sydney is being
consulted by manager Vincent in the rehearsals
of the Jap play “Darling of the Gods,” to be
produced before Easter. It is a very difficult
play for European actors to accomplish. The
English woman walks erect with her toes turned
out, the Jap lady Has to progress with a stoop,
and inturned toes, and her elbows close to her
sides, and arms hanging so as to make the shoul-
ders as slim as possible. Then the sitting down
has to be learnt. Japs sit on their heels,
and if you want to find out how stiff and muscle-
weary this pose makes you, try it for ten minutes.
In drinking tea, women drink from the side of
the cup just over the handle ; men hold their arms
in such a position as to drink from the side of the
cup furthest from the handle. Then the sexes
kneel and bow differently. All these customs
bring into play, when Europeans practise them,
entirely unexpected sets of muscles. In Eng-
land, after half-a-dozen rehearsals, Beerbohm
Tree’s co. used to complain of being so stiff that it
could hardly crawl. And yet people who work
under Tree, and keep in that manager’s good
graces, are said to have solid crawling experience
In some English women’s papers I see
picture faces wearing the new three-cornered hat
—the hat like the headgear of Napoleon, Nelson,
and Dick Turpin and ,r Jnote that the
cunning artist has put a hint of the Napole-
onic type, or the kiss-me,-Hardy expression, or a
highwayrnannish look into the faces. They are
not the empty, young, pussy-cat faces that usually
go under the latest thing in millinery, and it is
wonderful how the slight, old-acquaintance mien
of hat and face prejudices one in favor of the hat.
Then one tries on the “tricorne,” and—well,
some of us are disillusioned. Talking of hats
reminds me that the young widow of a Sydney
barrister has set up as a milliner, with a
lovely lot of Paris models, in George-street,
under the style of Madame Louise. Soon after
her husband’s death the lady went in for a regular
millinery training at Sydney’s two principal
shops. , .
The “tricorne” is new enough but not so
day-after-to-morrow as the “Torpedo.” InLondon
and Paris some decadents are wearing hats trimmed
with snakes. Eve’s friend is made of tiny, shaded
feathers, in bronze green, which look like real scales.
Owls’ heads are seen on some turbans to be worn
with tailor-mades. Among the new millinery
now on view are some jaunty French felts turned
up all round with cream silk braid, and bird-
quilled front or side. A toque which might illus-
trate “Night and Morning” had silver roses
embroidered on cloudy black, with trails of
chenille and a black and silver osprey. Red hats,
with a crown as big as a harvest moon, and two
inches of brim if seen from above, and as wide as
some suburban pavements underneath, are evi-
dently going to have a great vogue. Emerald
green and navy blue are used together on the new
millinery ; and the new chiffon velvet—an ethereal
fabric —has got an artistic hold on a lot of toques.
Beaver cloth is another strokeable thing of which
hats are wholly fashioned, and its effect is wonder-
fully softening to hard faces. Some faces, you
know, are hard. Not every woman has a face to
fit the Swinburnism “made out of a rose.”
Women buying hats are interesting studies. An
American humorist tells of the daughter of a man
who “got on ” that she ceased wearing hats and
took to ‘confections.’ “Shebought them languidly,
three at a time.” A local “confectioner” says
that Mrs. Kelly (the American Madame Butter-
fly) is the easiest woman to hat she ever met,
because she knows at ten paces and without trying
on what will suit her. A few days ago she bought
three hats in five minutes. Most women would
make a whole forenoon job of it.
Curious how the “Sign of the Cross ” (put on
at Her Majesty’s on Saturday) is gushed over by
women (well, some women) and disliked by men.
The scene in “S. of the C.” that men select for
special sneers is one which appeals to women
(well, some women) —in which Marcus Superbus
chivvies the Christian maiden around his premises,
until a thunder peal gives him pause, and reminds
him of the brevity of his garments and the sinful-
ness of his intentions. Women (again, some
women) like their romance with broad effects.
In this play they get them broad and strong
and florid. A girl confided to me that
“ she hated Mercia for being such a snow-
ball, and that if she had been in her place
the after tragedy would never have occurred.”
Also, another young briar-rose confided to me
that she “liked Julius Knight’s playing of the
scene so much better than Wilson Barrett’s,
because the former catches Mercia occasionally
which Barrett never seemed to do.” Unsym-
pathetic missie ! She didn’t make allowances for
the fact that Wilson B. is an ancient gentleman
who hobbles on to the stage in elevators and
can’t be expected to catch any girl who is at
all active. After that, whilst taking standing
exercise at the back of the circle, a man friend
sized up the play as “claptrap and thunderclap.’’
Which was, I suppose, the truth. But the lives
of the majority of the women of Suburbia (it is
Suburbia which goes to the “Sign of the Cross”)
are so destitute of romance—the narrow things of
the house, and the teething, measles, whooping
cough and the rest pall so much—that they wel-
come the fierce, garish romance of plays like the
“ Sign of the Cross.”
It is a glittery play, and women, “like moths,
are ever caught by the glare” (at least, Byron
says they are), and the shining Roman soldiers,
and Roman eagles, the fasces, ourule chairs and
laurel chaplets revive one’s childhood’s dreams of
the grandeur that was Rome.
Not many well-known faces in the auditorium
at “ Sign of the Cross ” on Saturday. The best-
looking people seemed to be in the stalls. Two
very fair-headed girls down there had what looked
like something new in the way of theatre coats—
in chiffon velvet, ivory white, with ruffle on
ruffle of black and white chiffon and perpen-
dicular strappings of narrow, pastel-blue ribbon
velvet. Miss von Arnheim and a young Fairfax
wife—the former in white, with a half-crown of
green leaves, the latter in gauzy black —looked a
Howard Chandler Christy pair. Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan looked on from a box as if he
were Laying Ancient Rome, or thinking
what a splendid “resumption” could be got
out of the grove by the Cestian Bridge—the
place where the insanitary-looking Christians
met to sing “yims.” Two girls in front row of
stalls exhibited the new hairdressing. If it gets
to be popular it will prove as unpopular with men
as is the matinee hat. These girls had built up
their beautiful hair almost a foot above their
enterprising faces. It gave them a hair-brained
loolu
Mrs. Burdekin and a fine-feather group were
also boxers. It was this lady’s last public
appearance in Sydney for a year to come. She
and her one unmarried daughter and two sons are
now on the Orontes, en route to London, where
the boys will go to Oxford and Eton respec-
tively.
If you ha /e seen Miss Lilian Foulis’ portrait,
especially that one on the post-card “English Cele-
brities” series, you will be struck by the likeness
to Mrs. Maesmore Morris—the Mrs. M. M. of some
years ago. But the violinist’s face has strength
and character, and her large, heavy-lidded grey
eyes seem ever to be looking beyond, at some-
thing back of the morning star —beyond platform,
audience and all, far into the dim Where-may-it-
be where the box office receipts are being counted.
It was a look that Melba and almost every
visiting musical genius had. Bhe is a tall, dark-
haired lassie, Australian, though born in Scot-
land (her father was a Sydney doctor), and made
her debut at ten years. To-day, in her early
twenties, she is mentioned in company with
Kubelik and Madame Halle. Her great grand-
father, Isaac Nathan, was a composer of note,
who came to Sydney when it was a young city,
and they used to go to Government house in a
bullock dray and count their wealth by their
hogsheads of rum.
Miss Foulis comes here well-lettered to Aus-
tralian Governors. This week her cousin, Mr.
Charles Nathan, and Chancelloress MacLaurin
(who was a Nathan) are giving her and her
mother, who accompanies her, a primrose time.
Nevin Tait, who is managing for the 1000 guinea
Strad. girl, has had telegrams from Ada Orossley
telling of the crowded houses she had in S’Africa.
By the Ventura, which left on Monday,
went, amongst others, Mr. and Mrs. Rennie
He was for many years general manager
in Australia of the Mutual Life of New
York, and knew a good horse and a good
playwright well. She is a smart dresser, and has
continued to keep a neat outline of figure. She
went on board in a black gown and the very
latest of green torpedo hats, with a streaming
green plume, and two cheeky little white bows
like a man’s evening ties under the brim, and
wearing the (Hardy Bros.) opal pansy brooch
presented by the staff of the M.L.N. Y. Pretty
Mrs. Jack Antill and a number of the
chronic womeu-residents at the Australia,
where the Rennies lived for years, cheered
up the time till the deep would begin to
heave and the lady passengers beg the stewardess
to throw them overboard and end their sufferings.
Major Rennie, his late staff’s presentation gold
cigar-case between his fingers, was farewelled by
a shoal of the most un-Lenten-looking men I ever
saw. Major Rennie’s son succeeds him. An-
other departer was Mrs. J. C. Williamson, who
goes as far as Auckland to meet her husband.
Mr. Macleod, general manager of The Bulletin,
accompanied his two daughters, who have started
to do some Maorilanding and Hot Springing.
By the bye, Dr. Angel Money’s brass-plate is
again winking in the and the doctor
himself is well and fresh after his trip.
No one would ever guess from its unpretentious
front, of the splendid interior of Baumann’s new
premises in Pitt-street, opposite Hordern’s. There
is a ballroom floor laid on springs, with supper
and cloak rooms upstairs, and the banquetting-
hall, restaurant, private rooms and lounge will,
when they are in working order, help to make
Sydney life better worth living. The bagasse
ceilings, stained windows, and carved woodwork
and marble halls and walls (the marble, in various
kinds, has been quarried in our own country) have
all been wrought by cunning artificers. Mr. W.
Baumann went through Europe lately, and
brought back some wonderful things in the way
of stoves, and I am not sure that you don’t get
your potato cooked by radium.
A returned Londoner tells me that Sydney girl
Lena Brasch has a nice part—Rosy Sky —in Beer-
bohm Tree’s production, “Darling of the Gods.”
She has also composed two songs, one, “For
Thee,’’words by C. C. Bethune, to be sung by
Alice Hollander at St. James’ Hall ; the other
“ Hush, Dearie,” a lullaby, to be sung by Carrie
Moore at the first opportunity.
Kathleen, third daughter of late brewer Edward
Fitzgerald, of Castlemaine (Vic.) is to be married
next month in London to one Henry Arundel
Pentheney O’Kelly, of the 18th Hussars. That
name would stand a lot of uniform. Miss Fitz-
gerald was in Sydney some five years ago with
her sister, Mrs. Prendergast. Like the latter,
i'ie is fair and good-figured. Since her widow-
hood Mrs. Prendergast has lived with her sister,
Mrs. Gordon, in Vic., where Colonel Maria
Gordon is commandant of the forces.
An unaccountable cablegram from London is
to the effect that the Geelong Fire Brigade has
presented its bronze medal to the Hon. Charlotte
Knollys, for waking up the Queen when her
Sandringham house was recently on fire. This
statement is unaccountable in various ways.
What has Geelong to do with the matter, to
begin with ? Then why should Geelong, which
is usually a very slow place, and seldom
arrives till the middle of next week, be
so lost in admiration of a lady who rushed
(Geelong never rushes) and woke somebody up
(waking up is contrary to all Geelong traditions) ?
Again, is it so unusual a thing to wake up a
burning monarch that the proceeding has to be
encouraged with a medal containing at least six-
penn’orth of metal? And seeing that the business
of a fire brigade is to pour water over burning
objects, why should it go off its beat to interfere
with a different department of the business?
There are other mysteries, but these strike me as
extra mysterious.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“An Englishwoman, long resident in Australia,
has just returned from a jaunt abroad, and relates
her impressions of the Old World, revisited. The
Australians, she says, are the cleanest people she
knows—because everywhere else the water-tax
seems to be a bogy. In London she paid a
shilling a bath, in America a dollar. She asked
the Americans staying in the hotels, ‘ How ever
do you afford one dollar every day for a bath ?
Why that’s 28s. per week?’ They said, ‘We do
without baths.’ In certain French towns all the
water is carried from the public pump, and the
boardinghouse-keeper would go mad if boarders
used it for anything but drinking. In
England the returned wanderer found the
friends of her youth ‘Church-mad.’ Eng-
land, to-day, gets up in the middle of the
night for‘vigils.’ Fasting is fashionable, and, at
church, the curate grovels on the floor, so that
hearers can’t think of the service because of study-
ing the soles of his boots. The meanest person
met abroad was a French boardinghouse-keeper,
who enlivened every meal by talk of the gluttony
of English people. This lady provided for break-
fast a loaf of bread the size of a cart-wheel and a pat
of butter as big as a wedding-ring, and you had to
make the two disproportionate elements coincide
in a meal as best you could. The far-famed
‘ French coffee ’ proved a pale, straw-colored dis-
appointment. Madame provided no matches.
Boarders were expected to ignite their candles
from a light kept burning downstairs.
“ This newly-returned wanderer tells that she
took stock of Queen Alexandra at an Ascot race-
meeting, where the royal personage spent most of
her day bowing and smiling, puppet-like, in a
glass pen, erected by the Ascot management for
the display of show potentates. That day, the
aspect of the ‘Viking’s daughter’ ( vide Tennyson)
was that of an exquisite wax figure, magnificent
in long pelisse of ermine, and toque to match, a
tall osprey towering at the side. But observers,
knowing the pink-cheeked, blue-eyed, golden-
haired poseuse to be no marionette, but a flesh -
and-blood grandmother of various sorrows, saw
something weird in her belated youthfulness,
something pathetic in her mechanical smile. John
Bull and his womenkind rather decry Alexandra’s
insipid, if decorative, amiability. ‘ She’s a pretty
nonentity—not a patch on the plucky old Queen,’
say they, forgetting that, for 30 years, masterful
Victoria’s understudy was permitted to be nothing
but ‘pretty,’ and to do little, beyond reading
French novels and planning Parisian bonnets.
Even her children were less her children than
Royal heirs, born to suit the succession and sacri-
ficed to its exigencies. A story, widely circulated
in England, has it that Alexandra, then Princess
of Wales, wearing deep mourning for her lost
boy, went down on her knees in vain prayers to
her mother in-law when the latter decreed that
the suppliant’s surviving son must take up all his
dead brother’s responsibilities, private as well as
public.
“ The present Princess of Wales is not exactly
■popular in England, but she’s approved of. ‘May
is hard —like the old Queen,’ says current tradi-
tion. Her husband has little hold on the nation,
but, so long as his popular papa is to the fore, it’s
a matter of only minor importance that the heir-
apparent has inherited neither his mother’s looks,
nor his father’s spirits.
“Commandant Hutton’s fair dame flourished
the greatest dress of the Melbourne Club hop. It
was a diaphanous affair of soft silk veiled in fleecy
white chiffon, on which blazed out large opulent
flowers, their gold being matched by a sovereign-
toned bolero. The pale mint color of the hair
made for more cash effect, while the Hutton dia-
monds perched proudly on the golden apex. Two
other matrons. Mrs. Pursey Chirnside and Mrs.
Everard Browne made display of gems of the first
water, but they were all beaten by the glare of
the great bandeau of single stones that blazed
from Lady Northcote’s head-tresses. For my own
part, I am not so struck with the diamonds of
great size as are most of my sex. It seems to me
that a diamond should wink, prettily and con-
fidentially, at the on-looker, not glare at him (or
her) like the head-light of a tram-car.
“The casual yachting girl of these parts was
out tracking round after the Bona and La
Carabine in Hobson’s Bay on Saturday. A race
was supposed to be afloat, but after watching Mr.
Wallace awhile at the wheel of the graceful Bona,
with a business and a nautical expression in his
weather eye, and looking on the brothers Clarke
at the head of a great crew carelessly finger-
ing the steering gear of sporty La Cara-
bine, the yachting girl concluded that the
race was off. So far the sea-charmer of Hob*
son’s Bay has no special rigging of her own.
She is addicted to picture hats and open-air yokes,
to say nothing of deck-trailing skirts and fal-
lals. Not one of the second sex, either on the
cruisers or the steam-tug, was fitted up with proper
sailing-gear.
“Theatrical enthusiasts fix their glasses these
nights on the large star sported by a petite mem-
ber of the Williamson Co. That star has a long
history. And there’s more to follow.
“ Lord Northcote is much addicted to the quote
habit. All of his Australian speeches, so far,
have had poetic trimmings.
“Miss Lilian Foulis, who fiddles divinely (so
advance notices state) on a genuine Stradivarius,
is given the best credentials for amiability and
good manners by her fellow-passengers. She
practised four hours at a stretch, without a break
for the frequent ship snack, in her cabin, and then
brought fiddle and bow to the saloon whenever
requested.
“All the talk anent physical culture of the
Sandow type, and Melbourne’s open - eyed
wonder at it, annoys long-established dancing
teachers, whose practice it is to get the beginner’s
muscles hardened and limbs supple before
initiating the toes into the showy pirouette or
the festive barn-hop. ‘Why, all dancing is, in
effect, physical culture,’ says one dancing teacher,
‘and only the grossly ignorant can hail the
Sandow cult for women as a novelty.’
“The Northcotes are springing new frills of
office upon the populace. The latest surprise
is a pennant flying ahead of the driving Y.R.
procession. An outrider canters in front, bearing
the Union Jack in full sail before the Excellencies.
Down at Footscray, where the violent odors dwell,
when they saw this, the cottagers reckoned a circus
was coming; and Footscray was, on the whole,
not far out.
“ The absence of the widow of Cliveden from all
recent social events is attributed to her con-
cern at the serious state of Mr. George Cruick-
shank’s health. He is married to a daughter of
the deceased baronet, a step-daughter of the
widow. J' /
“The English fashion of a bakers dozen of
bridesmaids is being revived. The effect of a
great bevy of pictui’esque girl is doubtless very
fine, but Heaven help the afflicted bridegroom
who has to provide twelve or more golden souvenirs
of the event and a dozen or more perishable and
highly-expensive floral trophies.
“Mrs. Gilbert Wilson has been seriously ill, but
she is on the mend. She is a good sample of the
pale, smart dazzler that Brisbane boasts.
“Surgeon T. N. Fitzgerald has left his private
hospital to take his sick self to Colombo. For
weeks he has been endeavoring to drop his lancets
and give his health a badly-needed airing. He
left it a trifle too long, and almost had to abandon
the trip at Adelaide.
“There is a Mrs. Bulky Johnson. Toorak
learns the news in a grudging spirit. It seems to
be regarded as a duty that vice-regal private
secretaries should come single-handed to these
parts. Mrs. Bulky Johnson joins her husfcs&fV
next month. 1
“The next visitor to drop her bandbox at
Government House will be the sister of Aide'
Balmain—the one breezy member of the staff.
By the way, all the Northcote body-guard are
said to be crack polo players, and Melbourne is to-
see their Indian form of play shortly.
“Squatter George Chirnside is off on a long
trip this time. He does the land of the artificial
ham from north to south thoroughly, then joins;
Mrs. George in her Mayfair establishment. Vic-
toria will not see this landed proprietor for two>
years. But it will remit his rents regularly..
Possibly before he returns the Federal Parlia-
ment will have done something disagreeable, and!
the rents will be remitted less absentee-tax.
“ The Henley regatta, don’t you know, is to be-
a tremendous splash. House-boats on the smelly
Yarra are to hold the Northcotes as well as the-
more swagger of local clans. It is comforting to>
know that those who fall off the houseboats will,
find themselves on land. There won’t be any
room, on the Yarra, to fall into the water from a i
houseboat.
“A few fashionable Christian Scientist's induced!
a Society dame who is over-addicted to strong:
drink to join their brand of Faith. But Spiritu-
alism didn’t take the place of spirits, and the lady
now spooks and drinks.
“The latest joke of a saucy hostess is taken;
from the suggestion of the chippy authoress of
‘Jemima.’ In the corner of her invitation cards-
(where you mention your bill of fare) she had the
intimation ‘Men’ printed, instead of the usual
stereotyped ‘Cards’or ‘Dancing.’
“Daily advertisement columns promise fat for-
tunes to canvassers. Occasionally a really
taking, popular line spells success for the tout,,
and that without much trouble. Hereabouts-
a young widow does good business as traveller for
a summer corset, invented in Queensland, andi
warranted to ‘ wash and boil. ’ It’s made mostly
of washing elastic, and, in place of bones, there-
are pliable chain-wires that slip in and out on
washing-day without scissoring or needling.
“ A Melbourne bride-elect has been kept busy
telling her friends that she is not marrying
millions. ‘We’ll be cosy,’ she says with a bland
smile, ‘ but we won’t wallow in wealth. With so
much a year one cannot run motor-stables and a
swell stud. ’ Fancy having to stop the babble of
gossips by submitting the bank-book !
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.


YOU NEED A TONIC.
This is just the season when you need a tonic to brace you up—and the best tonic in the world is
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are not common Pills. They don’t purge. They have no action on the
bowels. They do one thing only, but they do it well—they actually make new blood.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are absorbed gently into the system, toning the nerves and filling the
veins with new, pure, rich red blood.
This is why they cure all ailments caused by bad blood—anaemia, indigestion, palpitation, nervous-
ness, neuralgia, headaches, backaches, rheumatism, general weakness and it regular health.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are purely a blood-building nerve tonic. They will give you new strength
and energy. Better start taking them to-day—they’ll do you a world of good.
“I used to be a ruddy-complexioned strong man,”
says Mr. McKay, of Rock Lily, “ but I became weak
and subject to fits of biliousness. I lost all appetite,
and my skin was as pale as parchment. Doctors said
I was debilitated and dyspeptic. Learning of the
virtues of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills in a case like my
my own, I tried them. A few doses brightened me
up. One box made a world of difference. Two more
boxes enriched my blood to such an extent that I
was able to digest my food properly and gain
strength from it. Now lam sound, healthy, and
hardy, and no amount of work can tire me. That’s
the truthful record of what Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
did for me.”

PERSONAL ITEMS.
The father of S.A. Assembly, William
Gilbert had his 75th birthday on Feb. 23.
The death has occurred at Ballarat (Vic.)
of Mrs. Sword, widow of the late Emanuel 3word,
and niece of novelist Walter Scott. She arrived
m Victoria in ’52, and was 74 years of age.
Of the three N.S. Wales barristers who
have just taken silk, Alexander Gordon is the son
of an old N.S. Wales Q.C., not long deceased.
Bruce Smith is the son of a sea captain, and Dr.
Sly the son of a Bridge-street financier.
Dr. Reville returns to Sandhurst instead
of resigning, as was expected, and the Cardinal’s
secretary thus misses what was taken as a good
chance to be appointed head of a wealthy diocese.
Dean Backhaus’ £120,000 is still locked up there.
George Throssell, who took up the Wes-
tralian Premiership in the Groper interest when
Bigjohn gave up the job in 1901, has decided to
pass out of politics. Forrest, Leake, Lee-Steere,
Throssell—soon there won’t be a trace of old
Groperdom left in the House.
Just died in Adelaide, aged 51, brewer
R. A. Stock. He was manager for E. T. Smith’s
brewery, and, on latter’s retirement, controlled
the whole business. He formed the S.A. Brewing
Co., of which he was the head, but was next door
to a Rechabite, and didn’t drink his own beer.
Premier James, of Westralia, is said to
contemplate reaching out for the Groper Chief-
Justiceship when it is vacant, which will be
shortly. The struggle for a “stiddy job,” as the
assistant blacksmith of “In Mizzoura ” used to
put it, is dreadfully keen among politicians.
The Bent Government in Victoria has
definitely refused to continue for Mrs. Graham
Berry the little pension which was granted by the
State to her dead husband. So far as the Bent
Government is concerned, the aged widow of
Victoria’s one-time grand old democrat can starve
or go to gaol.
Baronet Cooper, son of Sydney’s old
Dan’l, is credited with the ambition to be sent out
as next State Governor of N.S.W. The new
Cooper is an enthusiastic sport, and that is re-
garded as a valuable qualification. But how would
it look to have the State Governor prosecuting
tattered old men for stealing Christmaß bush on
his Sydney estates ?
“BIG JOHN ” FORREST, OF WESTRALIA.
A Sydney morning newspaper recently
described ex-Justice M. H. Stephen as the eldest
son of his father, which was incorrect. The three
eldest sons of Chief Justice Alfred Stephen were
Alfred Hewlett, in the church, born 1826 ; Mon-
tagu Consett, in the law, born 1827; and Matthew
Henry, in the law, born 1828, all seeing daylight
first at Hobart, Van Diemen’s Land.
Jacob Garrard (£7OO a year) has been
superseded as President of the Board of Water
Supply and Sewerage (Sydney). He will, how-
ever, be appointed as one of the Government
representatives on the Board at .£250 a year. As
Jake lives in his own house on the North Shore
line, is a teetotaller, and has a free life pass on the
railways he ma" be able to exist.
David Reid, the Albury cockie who bobbed
up the other day for his 83rd anniversary, conneets
the present with the days of Governor Brisbane.
He went to school to Dr. Lang, married into the
family of explorer Hamilton Hume, made two
speeches in Parliament, and started the first horse
race in Albury His branch of the Reids (an
English stock) has a habit of long living, two
sisters over 80 being still extant in Melbourne.
Dr. Todd, barrister, physician, lately
deputy-coroner, and the subject of official corres-
pondence between the N.S.W. Attorney-General
and Public Service Board, had a prototype in
Mudgee many years ago. Dr. Belinfante admini-
stered legal and medical advice, and “sat” on a
stiff ’un from time to time. He also went into
politics, which it is said Dr. Todd contemplates
doing. “ Rolf Boldrewood,” in his goldfields
warden days, grew several streaks of grey hair
fighting local battles with Dr. Belinfante. David
Buchanan wrestled politically with the many-
sided man. Belinfante was at last finally “ sat ”
upon by a rival coroner, a flooded creek getting
the better of him as he tried to cross with his
wife. The wife was saved.
“X.X.X.' Par in ** Woman’s Letter
(B. 4/2/’O4) about the death, at Balmain (Sydney) of
an old Countess who had lived for many years
incog., reminds me of other incog, title-bearers
eking out an existence in N.S.W. An Italian
Count sellsfruit in King-street; a Baron belongs to
an orchestra; a “My Lady” is a seamstress, amd
an heir to a baronetcy is a milkman. All genuine
cases, known to me personally but confidentially.
Have heard of others, but cannot vouch.
An interesting identity of Neutral Bay
(Sydney) is Mr. J. F. Mann, now midway between
80 and 90 years of age. Mr. Mann was one of a
party of explorers which went out over half-a-
century ago to search for Leichhardt, with whom
he was personally acquainted. Mr. Mann enter-
tained a very poor opinion of Ludwig Leichhardt
as an explorer. “He would lose himself in
George-street,” was the old gentleman’s terse
comment. Mr. Mann is related to the explorer
Thomas Livingstone Mitchell. Exploring runs
in his family.
Parson Kantopoulos, late ministerial head
of the Greek Church in Melbourne, who fell out
with his congregation over the custody of the
metroon (a book in which the births, marriages,
and deaths of the Levantine population of Melb-
is recorded), is a saintly-looking individual, with
thin, sallow face, great dark eyes, a full black
beard, and raven locks screwed away under a
skull-cap. Kantopoulos is short and slight, but
the style of dress he adopts—a long black gown —
attracts the attention which seems necessary to
the vanity of sky-pilots of whatever denomina-
tion.
The “taking of silk” by Gordon, Sly
and Bruce Smith, of New South Wales Bar,
will give long-looked-for vacancies to the plodding
juniors in the way of opportunities for the draft-
ing of pleadings and “second” briefs, which a
K.C. cannot accept. All the new recipients of
the badge were entitled to it years ago, but didn’t
like to renounce their incomes from pleadings.
The grumblings of the juniors probably hurried
the acceptance of silk. One thorn still remains
for the Equity juniors—they are aghast at the
tenacity of a leader who still refuses the purple
and drafts some hundreds of pleadings every year.
E. W. Hawker, ex-M.L.A., of South Aus-
tralia, has forsaken politics. He and his father,
G. C. Hawker, sat together in the Assembly,
just as old and young Parkes did in N.S.W., and
somewhat after the manner of Premier Charles
Cowper and his son, when the old man took
Charles Cowper, junior, into his Ministry. There
might have also been two Kingstons sitting
together in S.A. Assembly, but for the fact that
old George Kingston died four months before his
son entered politics.
Jack Conway (Vic.) is the only survivor of
the eighteen Victorian cricketers who played, on
the ground of the Melbourne Club, the first game
against the first All-England Eleven (H. H.
Stephenson’s). Stephenson’s team was here in
1862, beginning its tour on New Year’s Day. All
Stephenson’s men have passed over. There were
no “ashes” in those days—not even a cinder;
the Englanders won in a single innings, with 96
runs to spare. Then they beat 22 Cornstalks at
Sydney with 49 runs to spare.
Sacristan Patrick Langton, of St. Mary’s,
Sydney, was buried last week. Pat was a devoted
servant of Mother Church and a determined hater
of cricketer Coningham. When Dr. O’Haran, on
the day of the verdict in his favor in the notorious
divorce suit, approached St. Mary’s, leaning on
the left arm of Jack Want and on the right ditto
of Barrister Ralston, with Tom Slattery “doing
splendidly” in the wake, Pat Langton, from the
top of the main steps, sent up an Irish whoop
that could be heard in Sussex-street.
Sydney Evening News knighted Senator
Tom Playford, of S. Australia,- the other day;
yet the big fellow ought to stand out con-
spicuously as one of the precious few old S.
Australian politicians who have steadily re-
fused the daub. Not counting, of course
Sudden Solomon who was too Sudden to
have any chance, and the present Jenkins, who
isn’t ripe yet, Kingston and Playford are the only
two S.A. premiers for over 30 years who haven’t
taken a title. Playford resisted it even during
his lengthy spell as Agent-General—and that
billet is usually fatal. It is now nearly 30 years
since he first became a Minister and nearly 40
since he first entered the S.A. Parliament; and
he has kept his market garden going all the time.
The family of ex-Governor Loftus, now
deceased, were all-round as impecunious as
N.S.W.’s one time Excellency. The three houses
of the Elys, Rathfarnham Castle, Ely Castle and
Loftus Hall, went under the hammer to appease
creditors. Mr. Garbett is well remembered in
Sydney as a constant resident at Government
House, though only a few knew that he was a
bailiff sent out by creditors to seize a percentage
of the Governor’s salary as it was paid. Garbett
and Captain Loftus were close chums, the latter
making it appear they were blood relatives, but the
Governor never took to the “man in possession.”
Loftus did not sell vegetables, as is supposed (it
was Governor Belmore who made a bit that way),
but he sold fancy fowls regularly and got good
prices too.

The next time Joseph Foster, of Mel-
bourne, transgresses the law of property he’ll
probably annex something sizeable, say a man-of-
war or a mountain. A while back he removed a
bike and the law gave him two years, but
suspended sentence so long as he kept to a straight
path. But he slipped again, and, going through
a casual stranger, took him down for all he
possessed—a whole penny. Now Joseph has to
do the former sentence as well as three month's for
the “ brown,” and it must dawn on him that the
game wasn’t worth the candle.
One of the sad old stories of Bully Bent’s
career as Speaker of the Vic. Assembly relates to
a certain wet night when the House had mostly
been enjoying itself. Bent reclined in the Chair
of Dignity with his hands folded on his paunch
and liis wig hanging negligently over his off-side
ear. Nobody thought of taking Tommy seriously
except a young teetotal member who, having been
sat upon by the awful potentate, bleated his mild
protest: “Mr. Speaker, I disagree with your
ruling on the point.” “ Oh, well, it’s good enough
for to-night, anyhow, ” said Bent.
Premier Seddon ear-marked “The Wearin’
o’ the Green.” years ago as his special song, and
even the driinkest politician knows better than to
jump the item when King Dick is there. Welling-
ton medico Cahill, who returned the other day
from a trip round the world, was glorified at a
banquet, and Seddon and Ward were present.
Either by accident or malice a miserable beast of
a band came and stood outside while the dinner
was going on, and struck up the grand old tune.
Every face paled, and a frantic individual flew
out and struck the band like a cannon-ball.
“Stop!” he cried. “Good God! Mr. Seddon’s
going to sing that directly.”
“ Spring ” on insurrectionists :
When I heard that John Haynes was going to break up
the Australian Commonwealth it set me thinking (for I
love rebels) of the world’s great insurgents. They seemed
to pass before me in procession. Danton, the terrible ;
Robespierre, the inflexible; Marat, the implacable.
They converse characteristically—Marat sneering at
Rohespiere’s weak habit of hanging his portrait on his
bedroom wall. “Marat’s is in the sewers,” replies the
curled and bedizened Robespierre. Danton denounces
Marat as a wood-louse, and shrugs his huge shoulders.
“Sometimes a shrug of the shoulders makes the head
fall, Danton,” snarls Marat, darkly. Robespierre is pale,
grave, with thin lips and powdered hair, and unwrinkled
light blue coat. Danton is an untidily dressed giant with
hair sticking stiffly up. His powerful pock-marked face
has large, blazingeyes. His mouth has kind corners and
thick lips which partly hide large teeth. Marat’s clothes
and hair are greasy, his mouth large and repulsive, his
forehead almost nil, his yellow face is blotched, and his
eyes are blood-injected. A world-dazzling trio. Others
go by like phantoms : Saint-Just, pale, profoundly sad,
with mvsterious eyes; Washington, wise-looking and
troubled ; Cromwell, with his noble wart planted on
his person where thrones saw and feared it;
Jack Cade of princely bearing (whatever that is);
Bogdan Khmelnicky, the great leader of the Cossack
revolt of 1651, who made the Polish oppressors tremble,
and taught the wild and manful Cossacks how to cut,
slash, stab, kill. Then there were others : Bern, Dembin-
ski, Kossuth, and the rest of the Hungarians of ’4B ;
Wolfe Tone, Bolivar, Miranda, San Martin, Iturbide,
Hidalgo, Cola di Rienzi; Kolokotrones, Canarie, Miaulis
and their fellow Greeks ; William the Silent; Garibaldi,
the Maccabees; Mehemet Ali, and the other Ali—he of
Janina ; Pekah, the son of Remaliah ; and Jeroboam,
the son of Nebat; Moses, the Devil, and innumerable
mighty rebels of old, whom I could not enumerate. With
their pictures fixed in ray eye I rushed madly forth to
get Jack Haynes to lead me to the field of carnage.
After two days’ search, saw him on a tram. I carefully
leaned my umbrella against the wall, put on my spectacles,
and scanned his person for traces of impending bloodshed.
Then I dropped the specs, with a snort. He lead us in
revolt! He ! HIM ! Hee—haw !
Bruce Smith, since he crawled into Par-
liament on all-fours under the whip of the P.D. A.,
whining that he never sent his children to a R.C.
School (which, by the way, he once did), seems to
have lost any political scruples he ever had. He
remarked in the House of Representatives the
other night that so little work had the High Court
to do that one of the Judges " had gone on a four
months’ tour of S’Africa.” Deakin interjected,
“you know that is not true,” and the Spruce
Myth fell lamely back on the plea that “ one of
the newspapers said so.” Then he started raving
about the demand of Victoria that the Australian
capital should be fixed in Melbourne, and being
indignantly told that no Victorian member had
advocated such a thing, the Myth thought “he
had seen it in some party’s platform.”
The late Leslie Stephen was, perhaps be-
cause of his Australian connections, deeply inte-
rested in Australian literature. Harold Stephen,
politician and journalist, a cousin of Leslie’s, kept
him in touch with the literary happenings of
Sydney and Melbourne, and Leslie’s neatly-written
little comments were mostly amusing. He wrote
on one occasion, “ If Australia ever lays a literary
egg your cackle will deafen Christendom.” On
another occasion, the crabbed microscopic charac-
ters conveyed: “You people should write for
children ; read another century before writing for
men.” And on another : “ Fairly good work, no
doubt; fairly good work; but I like it a little
better when it’s worse, for then you will not keep
on thinking it excellent.” And always : “Don’t
tell anyone in Australia to come to London to live
by his pen.”
“Pucha” makes some feeling remarks :
Maoriland newspapers are raising a mighty cloud cf
dustaboutone Plunket.orßunker, or Hunky, orsomething
of the sort, who has been appointed Governor in the place
of time-expired Ranfurly. One paper talks about Plunket
as representing not only the “ wit and national vivacity
of Ireland,” but also her “glorious past history.”
Another paper tells us in its list of virtues of the new
Governor that his father was the famous Archbishop
Plunket, and thus gives the show away. Prelate
Plunket, or Flunkey, or whatever it is, was chiefly
famous in his day for rabid Yellow Puppyism. It was he
to whom Henry George referred in “ Progress and
Poverty” when he wrote: “That right reverend Father
in God, Archbishop Lord Plunket, turned out some poor
tenants of his who refused to send their children to a
Protestant Sunday-school.” As for the new animated
Rubber Stamp himself there is nothing to be said ; up to
this probably he has not hurt a snail, but it is sickening
to wade through all the treacle that the M.L. Times and
other papers write about him and others of his class. It
is time a few daily papers began to think like democrats
living in a democratic community. Such men as
Plunket, or Bunkum, or Blanky, or whatever the right
name is, are anachronisms in our day, just as some of his
forebears were in theirs.
THE PLAGUE.
“A case of plague was reported to the Board of Health
yesterday, the victim being a lad of 16 named Oliver
Goldsmith.”
" Here we are again! ”
About late ex-Governor Loftus :
Augustus Loftus in his time must have been a cut above
the average well-connected person who becomes attached
to embassies and legations and such things. Apparently
he got a reputation for possessing considerable brains and
a lot of tact—and he kept his character. When the short
sharp war between Prussia and Austria was imminent
Loftus was appointed British ambassador at Berlin, and
when Russia, after the Franco-German war, began to
treat Britain as mud, Loftus was transferred to St.
Petersburg, where he remained what time Russia in-
vaded Turkey, and “ the Great Macdermott ” bawled his
historic Jingo song to the pot-valiants of the London
music-halls. It was Loftus, the diplomatist, who had the
job of constantly assuring the Czar that Britain’s em-
blematical lion did not want to fight but would be terrible
if roused. By the time that Russia and Turkey had
finished making widows and orphans and European com-
plications Loftus was a veteran of 62, and a very tired
veteran at that. So he came to N.S.W. as Governor and
drew his salary during six peaceful years. Then he
returned to England and he (or his creditors) retired on
a pension. With his usual tact and ability Loftus drew
the pension for 19 years.

“ Curlew ” : Re “ breaking” young horses
(B. 12/11/’O3). Lived next door to a town
“ breaker ” once. The young’un was stuck in a
yard with dirt to eat and a scanty supply of water.
Three or four days of this made a pretty tame
moke; if he had strength enough left to lift a
leg, back again to the pen, for a few more days’
“taming.” Result: promising youngsters turned
into broken-hearted, dispirited cusses, too tired to
protest against anything except travelling fast.
Referred to in local mudslinger as “our very suc-
cessful horse-tamer.” He was all that ; but I
shifted camp. Couldn’t eat well with him next
door.

“T.L.”: Witnessed a fight between
several Dagos at a country pub. in Maoriland
recently. Said fight resembled a Rugby football
match with kicking in the scrums not barred.
One Dago was heeled out of the scrum, showing
unmistakeable signs of having been used in the
place of a ball, and exclaimed that he could not
fight that plurry language. Also, by way of
changing the subject, I saw the following advertise-
ment in a Maoriland paper recently : “Wanted, a
governess; must be a good milker.”

“ War E.” : The other day I inspected a
bank-owned property. The dwelling and out-
houses on it, spacious and well-built,
were falling to pieces from neglect,
yards and fences ditto ; a fine gar-
den had been destroyed by rabbits,
which were the only stock on a
heavily-grassed area. An elder-
ly married man was the “ man-
ager,’’and his salary had been
gradually reduced till it repre-
sented little more than board
and lodging. He and his
wife apologised for not ask
ing me to stay for dinner—
the meal was to consist of
bread and dripping—as the
bank had cut off the meat
supply when the price of
sheep went up! The “man-
ager ” informed me that
he had asked for permission
to put in some crop on
his own account. Peremp-
tory refusal. He asked for
a liorse and a few imple-
ments so that he could keep
fences in repairs. The bank
assented to the repairing
business, but regretted that
it could not provide the
horse or implements, and it
recommended its “manager”
to borrow them for the pur-
pose from his neighbors !
This is no isolated instance
of the policy by which
wealth - producing settlers
have been driven from their
homes by a foreign corpora-
tion, which leaves the places
mere wastes, fondly hoping
that the increase of popula-
tion and the consequent de-
mand for agricultural land
will secure it a profitable buyer.
“Curlew” :'Have often com-
mented on aboriginal’s persistent ,
dread of big camp-fires. Once heard
it put down to fear of bush taking
fire, inherent for generations, until it became a
national (?) characteristic. Fancy the tired feeling
has something to do with it. Notice same in
Assyrians, Arabs, <fcc., but their progenitors
weren’t afraid of setting the sand on fire or com-
busting the Euphrates. They simply required to
economise fuel. Another theory is that Jaeky-
Jacky brought the habit in his gripsack when he
toddled down from Asia, via Malaya, Sumatra,
&c. He’s got a fair grip of it now, at any rate.

“A.A.” : Can animals talk to one
another ? I have no doubt about it so far
as dogs are concerned. Had a collie slut
who acquired a decided taste for hen’s eggs.
Before anyone had a chance to gather them
in she had tracked the cackling hen and
scoffed the product. Not that she was at
all particular about the eggs being new-
laid ; I once located a deserted setting
through hearing the eggs “pop” as theslut
put her teeth into them. Finally, I kept her
a prisoner on the chain. Her kennel was
against the fowl-house as a protection from
native cats, and she used to peer in with a
disgusted expression, watching the fowls lay.
Then, soon after my small boy acquired a
terrier pup, the eggs commenced to dis-
appear again. The pup was supposed to be
above suspicion, but I determined to watch
him because he was always “ talking” to the
slut. At last I caught the pup coming out
of the fowl-house with his jaws almost dis-
located in the effort to carry an egg. He
carried the egg carefully up to the eager-
eyed slut, and placed it gently before her
with mutual complimentary wagging of
tails. He returned for another one —and
met me. There was one dog less that night.

“Ses”: A drover travelling from
the remote West to Charleville (Q.), re-
cently attempted to cross 1470 mixel cattle
over the flooded Georgina at Bedourie Cross-
ing. The mob started ringing in midstream,
and over 300 were drowned. A mistake was
evidently made in not taking a few over first
to the opposite bank. On a long swim cattle
will nearly always try to make back to their
fellows if there are none ahead of them ; or
they ring and smother one another. Have
seen men ride with swimming c itt’e,
strlightening them when they turned, aid
piloting them from bank to bank as they
would on land. Drawing-room drovers
generally bundle them into water in a packed
mob and let them rip. They often get over
without loss, and accordingly receive credi
for good management. Only cattle-men know
what unnecessary risks were taken, and how
the “ good management ” was fluked.

“ Cecil P.” : In response to an inquiry
from his teacher the other day, a N.S.W. school-
boy declared that “a man was a thing that cuts
wood.” O, wise young judge ! And how con-
foundly blunt the axe often is !
“ F.” : Explorer Thomas L. Mitchell, in
1835, discovered on the Darling an aborigines’
burial ground, called by the blacks Milmoridien.
Extensively laid out walks intersected the graves,
and mounds were planted with
beautiful shrubs or trees like
mourning feathers. “Civi-
lised man,” said Mitchell,
“ could not have displayed
more taste in beautifying
the resting-place of the
dead.” Can any of The
Bulletin’s way - back
readers identify the spot?
AN OBJECT OF TERROR.
GARDENER : “ Yes, mum, the birds are very bad
this season, they play up something awful
with this new garden.”
OLD LADY : “ Well, John, couldn't we rig up a
scarecrow?"
GARDENER : “ Lord bless ye, mum, I believe they'd
come jest th ’ same if you went and stood there
yourself.”
One can’t get a much closer call than
came the way of a White Cliffs (N.S.W.)
opal-gouger lately. They don’t timbei the
shallow rabbit-warrens in which the gem-
gouging is done, and up to now the diggers
have had extraordinary luck in mostly being
somewhere else when the workings started
to cave in. One of them, M‘Donald, was,
however, caught the other day as he was
tapping the roof of an old drive ; the stuff
buried him until only his finger-tips were
exposed. White Clifts crowded down to
dig him out; but it took a long while, for
the working space was small, and more
stuff kept falling ; and it was a solid hour
before the man’s face was exposed, and
another hour before his body was let loose.
And still he was alive ; the mullock had
fallen about him loosely, and hadn’t stopped
up his nostrils, and he got enough air to
just keep him going. There was a some-
what similar case a few years ago in a
Broken Hill mine. A creep took place,
killing three or four men; and another was
missing—he was pinned under a thick flake
of rock. They expected to take out a
mangled miner when they got this rock
away ; but, instead, he was alive and appa-
rently unhurt —his body had just fitted into
a slight cavity in the flake. The papers
said at the time that the man had had a
marvellous escape ; but perhaps it would
have been better if he hadn’t, for within a
few weeks he had become a complete phy-
sical and nervous wreck.

“ A.P.R.” : The vilest crustacean
that wears scales is the Castlereagh cray-
fish. Soon as your fishing-line is cast he
seizes the bait and consumes it at his leisure,
after which he carefully hangs the hook
■on a snag, so that the line will be broken
in detaching it. The cray-fish presumably re-
gards you as a benevolent lunatic, who sits up
all night just to feed him; and this idea is
annoying, especially since he drives away all
other fish. Farmers detest cray-fish, because
they burrow underneath the embankments of the
dams, eventually destroying them. The cray-
fish is also a vile cannibal, who will chew at a
piece of his father (used as a bait), before the
parent is cold.
“ Owl-light ” on our natural resources
(written before the late rains):
Scene—Backblocks pub ; a few clouds about the sky
and a dust storm looming' up away in the west. Tuo
selectors sitting under the verandah deploring the
drought.
First Selector : “ My paddock is swept clean away and
every hoof is dead.”
Second ditto : “ My house is banked all around with
dust three feet deep.”
Publican (stepping out and looking at the skv
critically): “1 think we will have it before long; the
wind is in the right place and them clouds looks
suspicious.”
Colonial experience Johnnie (who arm o<l in the coach
that morning brand new from England) : *' Baye Jove 1
What evah is that ?” pointing to the big black du-t storm
now slowly rolling towards the pub from over the plain.
Selector : “ That’s a selection.”
Johnnie : “ A what? ”
Selector : “ A selection, o’ course.”
Johnnie : “ Baye Jove ! How tewibly black. Where is
ifc going ? ”
Selector: “ Struth ! Yer green. Didn’t yer never
hear of our great natural resources ?”
Johnnie : “ Well, ah, yes, I did ; I heaid Mr. Wise
before I left England speak of them. Is this one ?”
Selector : “ O’ course it is.”
Johnnie : “How stwange.”
And then the selection rolled over the town and all was
silently buried for two hours.

The forest of Robin Hood was a quite
insecure refuge compared to the forest of varie-
gated thistles that surrounds Moree (N.S.W.) at
present. The black-soil plains have sent forth a
dense growth that averages about 10ft.. in height,
and which in many places forms an impassable
barrier for miles. Horses won’t face it at all.
Provided the local law-breaker beats the pursuing
police to the wall of thistles he is then lafe ;
accordingly the thistles are acquiring quite a
population. Cave-dwelling having gone out of
fashion so long ago, it’s about time thistles got a
turn, and evolutionists should give their serious
attention to the possibility of the Australians
becoming a thistle-dwelling race in the near
future.
* * * *
“ War E.” : The average sheep-farmer
seems to be about the most picturesque baron the
continent. For years he lied about his lamb-
marking percentage ; then the man who made up
the statistics began to inquire how the discrepancy
between “returns” and reports came about !
Then the sheep-man got to work on the “ average
weight” of his clip, but the financial institution
inquired where the rest of the wool had gone.
The sheep-liar wasn’t beaten yet— nd lie’s on safe
ground this time. The weight of fleeces cut from
his few “ extra special studs ” is going up rapidly.
The highest I’ve seen this season is a ewe 3U.lt.
and a ram 561 b. ! Just fancy a merino carrying
half-a-cwt. of wool round ! Wouldn’t mind bet-
ing it’ll be half-a-ton next year.

When the law first came in vogue in N.Q.
that blackboys had to sign on with their em-
ployers for a certain period, Tomkins was very
wroth that he, a white man, and a man of property
—he owned a small team of horses—should he
forced to enter into a contract of any kind with a
nigger. But the sergeant of police told him it
was inevitable. “ All right,” grumbled Tomkins,
“ but all the same it’s a crying shame that l should
have to bring meself down to the level of a dashed
aboriginal like that.” The papers were filled in

and the pen handed to Mr. Tomkins. Mr. Tom-
kins cleared his throat violently and at last blush-
ingly admitted that his education had been ne-
glected and lie could only hold the pen and
make his cross, which he did. Then Binghi was
called on to hold the pen and make his mark.
“Oh, thank you,” said Binghi politely. “lean
read and write.” The sergeant poured water oyer
Tomkins, and when he came round he said:
“Eddication has ruined this dashed country.”
IN PREHISTORIC DAYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the Dodo gladly gurgled out his prehistoric la3 r ,
And our early relatives were mostly beast;
When the earth lay dark and silent ’neath the first dawn
clouds of gray,
Long before the golden sun rose in the east;
Then the early tribal ladies gaily pranced upon a rock,
And their flowing manes of hair waved in the wind,
And the prehistoric baldhead who objected got a shock
When they hit him with a stone axe from behind.
They had very little comfort, had the people who came
first—
As a rule, they had to eat the entrees raw ;
They who couldn’t catch their dinner, prehistorically
cursed,
But each party waved the implement he wore ;
If some unsuspecting neighbor came wand’ring gently
by.
Dreaming happy dreams of his suburban cave,
Someone rolled a boulder on him, with a half-regretful
sigh
For the sudden end of one so young and brave.
They were vigorous and simple were our relatives of yore
And, of course, the early ladies did their best,
But if Pa got argumentative, and forgot himself and
swore,
Well—Ma tripped him up and sat upon his chest,
While the family would go on sadly gnawing in the dark,
Wondering how they could possess so little pride,
But would recollect with pleasure as they hacked at the
cold shark
That the weapons of the push were kept outside.
They knew naught of care and comfort, our relatione
long ago,
They had neither summer drinks nor thoughts nor cares.
And they flirted with each other sitting waist-high in the
snow,
And the only things that saw them were the bears.
There were neither plagues nor poets—only rending earth-
quake shocks,
No distractions, like mere work or problem plays.
All was giggle and flirtation in a world of sullen rocks
In the good old jolly prehistoric days.

ITEET HE AT THE HARBLE BAR.
' l Hugh Stone ” : I knew
a man in a wild mountainous
district of N.S.W. whose imi-
tation of the dingo’s howl was
so natural as to deceive the
animal itself. He used to go
up in the range with his rifle
and draw the dingoes to him
by imitating their melancholy
utterance. Then there would
be a dead dingo. Crossing the
range one clear moonlight night
he started howling. Imme-
diately he got a response miles
down the range. For an hour
he howled walking down the
mountain to meet his rival,
and the rival howled walking
up. In a clear patch he halted
and gave what he thought
ought to be the final howl, and
levelled his gun. A minute
later a neighbor who had ac-
quired the same accomplish-
ment stepped into the open,
levelled his gun, and howled.
It was nearly a tragedy.

“ Werrimee ” : The bird
which “Vinco” (8., 25/2/’O4)
calls a mutton-bird is the pied
erOw-shrike, or black magpie
(Strepera graculina). It is
also called the fruit-eating
magpie, though it feeds largely
on carrion, and is just as de-
structive among com as crows
are. In some places it is called
the mutton-bird, but is more
widely known as the black
magpie. Very plentiful on
the northern rivers of N.S.W.
The common magpie (Gymnor-
hina tibiccn) is known as the
piping crow-shrike, or black-
backed crow - shrike, and is
principally confined to N.S.W.
Though the common magpie,
black magpie and butcher-bird
belong to the one family, and
are generically called shrikes
or butcher - birds, they are
specifically different and bear
very little resemblance to one
another. Australia has nearly
30 different shrikes. The mut-
ton-bird (Nectric brevicaudus)
belongs to the water-fowl, and
is very numerous among the
southern islands."
“Waler”: Be the in-
crease in shearing-rates: In
nearly all pastoral and farming
work rates have fallen steadily
within the last 20 years—fenc-
ing, clearing, harvesting, etc.
There was a time when clearing,
i.e., grubbing for the plough,
was paid for by the inch ■ — a
penny an inch for trees. For
instance, a tree 3ft. was
reckoned at 35., and so on.
This was merely for getting the
tree down ; the burning off
was a separate contract. Men
will now clear an acre for what
a few trees brought in those
days ! A clever dodge in grub-
bing then was, when you struck a tree with
tremendous roots to follow, to dig a hole alongside
and throw the earth on to the stump. The holes
had to be left open for inspection. The hole
alongside always passed—for a time.

“Deeby”: An immense destruction of
small fish occurs when the Macquarie and other
western rivers are in flood. As the water recedes
the hollow ground at the feet of the big gums on
the flats or false banks is filled with dead fish of
various species. Was once travelling by the
Lachlan, when I noticed off the track what
appeared to be a newspaper flapping in the wind.
Investigation proved it to be a stranded 101 b.
cod fish lying in a pool of water nofcvmore than
2in. deep. It had been lying in that shallow pool
for at least 24 hours. Wonder how long it is
possible for a fish to live under these conditions,
allowing the crows keep away.
ALMOST DEAD.

don't see why the editor-in-chief of a Great Daily should

“ J.A.C.” : Be curious “shingles.” There

’possum and a whole lamb inside. These goannas
did not butt against trees to ram their food down
—none of the surrounding timber bore any marks
of violence. I understand one goanna helps the
other. The goanna is remarkable for a very stiff
tail —in which he differs from the Australian
Eleven.

“ K.N.T.” (a woman) writes from a far-
back W. A. town as to aborigines’ protection :
I had for some years an intelligent little aboriginal
child. She was motherless, and her father was a tracker.
After giving her to me, he left the district. When the
girl was seven years of age a white man, or rather devil,
ruined her, and for two years I tried to cure her of a
loathsome disease, but without success. I applied to the
aborigines protector, and he warned me against “ harbor-
ing an aboriginal.” When I told him I could not and
would not hunt the girl away, as she would surely die,
he wanted to know what that was to me. He said,
“ Whip her away into the bush and let her die.” That is
aborigine protection as practised in W.A.

“G.M. ’ : Re par in Bulletin (21/l/’O4)
about two tourists meeting a Maori in the
Waikato district, between Waikaremoana and
Te Aroha. Waikaremoana is in the Wairoa dis-
trict, Hawke’s Bay. This reminds me that a
friend of mine was walking in the Gippsland dis-
trict, between Mildura and Hopetoun, when he
met a black carrying a message-stick. After two
hours’ close study my friend discovered that the
stick was a message from King Billy of Gippsland
to the chief of the Bourke-street tribe, saying that
Russia and Japan were going to war because
Irvine excluded the six hatters. It also had a
drawing of Reid on it in a kneeling attitude,
apparently wooing the Labor party. I know this
is true, because I met the black the following
morning just round the first corner after you pass
Hades, about six miles from Bourke and close to
Bill Jones’ public-house.
WASHING UP!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When you’re young and full of push,
And you’re living in the bush,
Far away in timbered country wh»re the neighbors are
not thick,
Oh ! the time that cools your heat,
And that knocks you off your feet,
Is that day of dire misfortune when you have the missus
sick !
’Tis the small ills, wise men say,
That drive happiness away—
’ Tis the irritating trifles that fill Sorrow’s bitter cup !
And you’ll own this doctrine true,
When, besides your work to do,
There's the housework for the missus, and the job of
washing up.
With a confidence sublime,
You resolve that every time
You have meals you’ll wash the dishes—keep the crock’ry
clean and bright.
You prefer things to look nice ;
So you do it—once or twice !
Then at morn and noon you leave it—you will wash the
lot at night!
And the stuff accumulates—
Oups and saucers, also plates—
But you promised, so you do it, ere you have a bite or
sup!
Though when one has held the plough,
It seems paltry, anyhow- -
Not a bit like manly grafting, is the job of washing up 1
So you clean up what will do—
Just enough to see you through ;
Then you put off washing any while there’s clean ones on
the shelf 1
And the missus, it is plain,
When she’s up and out agan,
Will discover you have used up all her little stock of delf 1
As you older, wiser grow,
All that’s needful you will know
Is a knife, fork, plate (one only), with a spoon, maybe,
and cup !
And I reckon him a man
Built on an heroic plan,
And deserving of a statue, who can patiently wash-up !

L.R.P. : One pretty good verse ; two very
weak ones.... Arlic : Verses set forth (1) that we lost the
dashed “ ashes ” fairly ; (2) that we aren’t going to
grumble or try to excuse ourselves over the blessed
“ashes”; (3) that we wouldn’t have lost the miserable
“ ashes” only for the weather. Blow the “ashes !....
Boomfogle : Bulletin’s opinion is that if a domestic who
could get 17s. is willing to take 7s. so as to be called a
“ lady yelp ” she deserves 4s. 6d. If the skilled workman
who now makes £3 a week wanted to live with the boss
and pretend to be one of the family, the chances are that
he would only get Cs. And he would deserve 3s. 9d

less Si: Some good lines in “ If, but too many bad

tin staff, and it is dressed just as a Freetrade Ministry
might dress ; wherefore he assumes that, wherever
possible, it patronises imported goods. As he never saw
a Freetrade Ministry (i.e., one which practised Ireetrade)
in Australia, how does he know how such a combination
would dress7....J.F. : Proposal to ca.ll the Aus-

protected N.S.W. tobacco to the extent of Is. 9<l. per lb.,
and had the front to call that Freetrade, it might be best
to ask them about the matter J.H. (Mosman’s) : Will
print “Tin Trunk.” Jeparit: Too slender an item
Alice J. : “Honor” is tod gruesome, and with a crude,
ill-punctuated gruesomeness... .Harrie N. : Too rambling,
and no definite plot. An old man talking promiscuously
on horseback about cattle-stealing, and then being killed
by his horse falling on him isn’t exactly a story .. . .G. W. :
“ Game of Poker” has very' little interest Silly Billy :
You reckon that, with the “ weather table ” published in
that quack medicine pamphlet, “we will be able to do
without” Government meteorologists. Quite so. Notice
your fool of a “weather table” says that if, in winter,
new moon, full moon, or first or last quarter “ happens”
between 2 and I a.m. snow will follow. How often does
snow follow at Rockhampton or Sydney? And there
isn’t a mention of a drought, or a southerly buster, or a
hot wind, in the whole list.

moderate down to the thing that calls for cuss language.
....Mervyn: One joke is very weak. The other is an
old Bulletin joke with a hopelessly inappropriate illus-
tion attached. Any joke can be illustrated after a fashion
by drawing Jones and Brown, and explaining underneath
that Brown is telling Jones the joke H.S.S. : Below

the soft part.
“On the arrival of the steamer he was welcomed by
about 40 local adherents, many of whom were treated by
him for various ailments. He lightly touched the
affected parts.”
“ The affected part ” was very apparent in the
case of most of the adherents, and the wily Elijah
had no difficulty in “ touching the spot.” This
case was considered pretty hopeless.
“ Hugh Stone ” writes :
When I was a State teacher I was once appointed to a
mountainous district, the home of a sang of bush-
rangers who finished life’s short histor3' on the Darling-
hurst gallows. The old feeling which had caused the
brothers to make war upon society in the sixties was still
in the new generation when I arrived in the nineties.
They did not settle quarrels by a stand-up fight or ail
appeal to a police court, but they got even on each other
bv damaging stock, fences, and crops. I remember on
one occasion two female neighbors had the usual feminine
difference. No 1 vowed vengeance on No. 2, and one day,
when the latter came home from a visit, she found a
well-bred chook, with sundry well-bred chicks, all with
necks screwed, laid artistically along the doorstep as a
sign that it was to be war to the knife. I lived on a sort
of volcano, for I reckoned my time would come some
day, and it did. I had to report a grand-nephew of one
of the dead bushrangers, and the eruption began. A
valuable horse that never had the roving spirit in him,
suddenly disappeared, and though I had police and black
trackers after' him, I never saw him again. Almost
everything else disappeared by degrees. At last the
place grew so untenable that I also disappeared. I
believe this strange midnight method of hen-and-horse
warfare still survives in those parts.

REFORM WITHOUT REVOLUTION.—
The great and particular merit of Hunyadi Janos
is that it relieves without discomfort, in other
words, it effects reform without revolution. This
is because it is the best and safest natural
aperient.*
During the last twelve months there have
been twelve convictions for murder in Westralia,
and the convicts have been all Japs, Chinese,
Afghans, and other aliens. Yet White Australia
has to pay for the gallows, and the rope, and the
bear-grease on the rope, and the Nosey Bobs’
wages, and the wear and t >ar of gaol, and all the
other sundries.
Twelve Years of Indigestion.
Doctors Advised Operating.
A Remarkable Cure by Bile Beans.
“ About nineteen years ago,” says Mr. Henry
Speer, a blacksmith, of Lvnch-street, Young,
N.S.W., “I first felt the symptoms of indiges-
tion. The pains I experienced were terrible, and
would completely double me up. I consulted
several doctors. They all agreed it was an
aggravated form of indigestion, and one told me
that I would not live four hours unless I got ease
from the pain. Another doctor advised operating,
but this I would not agree to. All the doctors
could do for me was to administer morphia and
opium to deaden the pain. I was under the
doctors’ hand for many years, attending them
regularly, until ray patience was exhausted.
About seven years ago, hearing that Bile Beans
had cured many cases of indige-tion, I decided to
give them a fair trial. After having taken them
regular v for a month or six weeks, I noticed a
great improvement in my condition. Thus
encouraged, I persevered with the Beans, and was
effectively and thoroughly cured. It is now five
years since I had an attack of indigestion, which
I think can be taken as a guarantee that the cure
is permanent. Where life was once a burden, it
is now a pleasure, and altogether I feel a different
man. I have now been a resident of Young for
seven vears and am consequently well-known.”
Bile Beans are a permanent and speedy cure for
biliousness, headache, indigestion, constipation,
piles, debility, female weaknesses, nervousness,
bad blood, bad breath, anaemia, insomnia, loss of
appetite, and in fact, all ailments that owe their
origin to defective liver action. Bile Beans are
obtainable from all medicine vendors, price

Business, Robbery, etc.
“ Chasselas ”: “ Eiddal ” (Bulletin 25/2/’O4) is
mistaken if he thinks I hold a brief for cheap Yankee
lines of machinery. What I want is a stiff import
duty to exclude Yank and German goods, so that the
money at present going to enrich foreign manufacturers
will be circulated in these States. All Yankee goods are
not the cheap and nasty sort “ Eiddal ” mentions.
Present writer has a Canadian binder which has done
good service for 15 years, and is still going strong. Yank
malleable castings, however bad, are superior to and
lighter than the heavy, crude, rotten castings manu-
factured locally. Fortunately, good Australian makers
use little cast, knowing they can’t rely on it. But why
not manufacture our own malleable castings, and make
them good enough to lighten the splendid machinery
turned out by local firms ?
* * * *
It was a German who first thought of making
firearms without screws, and the Mauser people turned'
out a repeating pistol which was composed of pieces
which dovetailed into each other and were finally held
together by a spring-pin. Once the spring-pin was
removed the whole weapon could be
taken to pieces with the forefinger
and thumb in ssec. and put together
in a very few seconds more. Now
the detachable bike has come.
The parts dovetail, and can be
taken apart and packed in a case,
which is carried on the top frame
bar, and which measures 29in. by
Sin. The idea of the inventor was
to save cyclists the special charges
levied on their bikes by railroad
and ferry companies, but the in-
vention has turned out such a
success that the military authori-
ties of five nations are testing the
thing severely with a view to
adopting it for infantry. The gain
in mobility would be enormous.

“W.S.T.”: Much nonsense
is printed from week to week about
the extent and richness of the
N.S.W, fishing grounds. As a
matter of fact, the supply of first
quality fish is small and variable.
Bar the alleged “ salmon ” and sea-
mullet (the former bad as a food*
fish, and the latter coarse and
tasteless except when in roe),
there are but few net-fish obtain-
able. A few whiting can still tie
caught, but the dainty flounder
and garfish seem to be things of
the past, and the river mullet is
getting ever scarcer Of line-fishes
we still have schnapper, bream of
various kinds, flathead, and jew-
fish, the last often figuring as
schnapper on the menu of the fish
shops. But with the exception of
“jewy,” it would not pay to fish
for these varieties oilier than from
a picnic point of view. We have no
banks to fish for cod ; the dainty
and swarming herring of Northern
seas is entirely absent; the floun-
der of Tasmaiiia-Maori waters is
poorly represented ; the trumpeter
and barracouta are too far away ;
and pilchards come and go only at
three or four year intervals.
Where, then, are our “magnificent
fish resources?”

Australia’s best-known col-
lection of stamps, owned by W. F.
Petterd, of Launceston, Tas., has
changed hands ; £2500 was paid
for it through a Sydney agent,
Walter Hull. Petterd has a mania for collecting
things ; he has or had fine collections also of minerals
and natural history specimens. There used to be a
story that one Australian mining expert, sent across
to report on the then newl.v-discovered Zeehan and
Dundas fields, some years ago, for a big fee, got no
further than Launceston, where he wrote a much-quoted
monograph on the strength of Petterd’s collection and a
yarn with Montgomery, the Government geologist.

“Yes,” yarned the boss of the hosiery depart-
ment working overtime, “ when I joined this warehouse
we had a Distressed Employees’ Fund, and anyone who
joined and got hurt could draw on.it. I was a mean
little nipper in those days, and wouldn't join, and conse-
quently got a rough time, but 1 held out. At last I had
an inkling that the town entry-room clerks, were up to
some mischief, so I hurried to the sec. and paid my first
sub. of 3d. per week. Then I went down to the entry
room, and old , who was boss of that part then, con-
veniently turned his head, and the boys bustle 1 me into
the biggest wheeler (like they do the new chums now)
and bounced me horribly. The result was that my arm
was broken. I didn’t split, but told the manager I’d
fallen downstairs. I had to go to bed for some weeks,
but that didn’t hurt much, and as I drew full screw I
didn’t mind in the least When I went back I said to the
boys in the entry-room • * I’m going to draw ex’s, out of
the fund for that accident. ‘You’re not a member,
though,’ someone said. ‘Who said?’ I asked quietly.
You go and ask the secretary.’ And when they did
they told me I was too smart for the entry-room and that
I ought to be a traveller. It was 3d. well speculated.
What do you think? But the worst of it is that I’ve been
a member ever since, and haven’t had a blooming illness.”

Advt. in a recent S.M.;—
CJMART GIRL, 13 or 14, train light Gen., for Coll., 2
° ad.,lch.,g. h., 10s. m., ref. E. G., P. 0., Waverley.
The struggle to get the whole story into a sixpenny
notice.
“Bengalla,” from Gippsland : Down our
way harvest commences early—September gener-
ally. We gather it in with tomahawks, and
bind it in bundles with string.v-bark ties. Our
crop is the only one which this heavily-tim-
bered country will produce with facility
in the early stages of settlement, and con-
sists of the bark of the black wattle.
Notwithstanding its astringent qualities,
we live and thrive upon it ; and, when
prices go up to £7 per ton, talk freely of
taking up more land. The wattle, in-
deed, has been the main factor in settling
hundreds of men with large families and
small means upon thousands of acres in
this section, as it has afforded them the
means of living while engaged in subdu-
ing the dense forest. When Irvine came
into power, we selectors generally re-
garded his policy of economic reform
with favor, and said that revenue must
be raised even if the individual suffered ;
but when he reached for us by proclaim-
ing new and drastic provisions for wattle-
stripping on Crown lands —which, in
practice, meant handing over to the
Treasury about half its gross value per
ton—we" were unanimously of opinion
that the liberty of the subject was en-
dangered and his territorial rights
ignored. Naturally we regard the fluctu-
ations of the bark market with interest,
and our spirits rise or fall as the price
goes up or down. At the beginning of
one season prices ruled very low, and
a poor selector, holding over 2000 acres
heavily cropped with bark, and, to a less
extent by sheep, got the bulge on his neighbors by con-
tracting to supply a local tanner with a large quantity of
bark at a shade over current rate. Stripping and delivery
went on merrily until, suddenly, prices went up with a
bound. Then stripping went on, but delivery (to the
local tanner) ceased. The selector, as a Freetrader,
logically sold in the dearest market, notwithstanding
frequent applications from the tanner, and continued to
do so for two seasons. The tanner, getting tired of moral
suasion, had recourse at last to legal pressure ; and this
brought the selector to explain things. He endeavored
to arouse the tanner’s higher feelings (they were both
Wesleyans). Could he, knowingly, add to the weight of
the cross he (the selector) was then bearing ! The tanner
said he could, and added £9O costs to it, and got his
bark.

“ Petramos ” writes of a new tooth-ache cure :
Jones and Brown, dentists, occupied adjoining shops.
Jones engaged a man to wear a uniform and stand
outside and direct suffering humanity his way, and
Brown copied the idea; wherefore there was trouble,
Jones threatening to sue Brown for infringement of the
Molar Extractors’ Copyright Act. But the commis-
sionaires were affable persons, and in a little while
got on all right together, and agreed to divide cus-
tomers, so that neither would lose his job for not being
as smart as the other. Things progressed favorably
until Smith, a third extractor, started business dose
by, and engaged a man to stand outside also. The
third man dressed like a dilapidated constable, and wore
a padded chest. One day a small woman, from Farback
apparently, paused, and gazed vacantly at the three pain-
less establishments, and the cheap imitation of the Law
endeavored to escort her to his boss ; hut the Jones man
took a hand, conveying in innuendoes that Smith was an
unregistered quack. The Smith man called the Jones
man fancy names, whilst the Brown man stood peaceably
in the background, content, for the time being, to remain
the Jones man’s sleeping partner. The old lady became
excited, for she was dragged first one way, then the other.
AN ADVENTURE WITH MUNGINDI
MOSQUITOES.
Suddenly the Smith man smote his rival on the stum-
mick, and the Jones man punched back, landing on the
padded chest. The lady politely stepped aside so as not
to hinder the fight. Five minutes later, whilst the Jones
mail was on his way to the local hospital; and the Smith
man (minus his chest) was gathering pieces of his lost
manhood off the hard, cruel pavement, Brown’s emissary
sailed smilingly up to the old lady and asked her to step
Brown’s way. But she uttered a sudden ejaculation of
delight: “ I’d forgot all about it. Watehin’ those fellows
it must’ave stopped.” Brown’s man was disappointed.
He was an Irishman, and considered he'd stayed out of a
fight without remuneration.

“S.T.S.”: I don’t know Mr. Mephan Ferguson
from a crow. Is the fact that he advertises in The
Bulletin any bar to my rejoicing over a par. just found
in a Birmingham paper? They seem to think a lot of
his steel pipes in the Black Country, chiefly because the
36 inch article can he made 28 feet long, requiring far
fewer joints than the local cast-iron pipe, which I
remember as running to about nine feet. To the
patriotic Australian, it is a refreshing change from the
usual order of things to read of “ headworks at Mel-
bourne, with a branch near Birmingham,” and that “ a
plant and several skilled men have been brought from
Australia.”

Two leading Broken Hill business houses have
made a new departure in the transport of goods from
Adelaide. Recently 130 tons of groceries and draperies
arrived in Broken Hill via Menindie, from Adelaide.
Other similar loading is now at Menindie awaiting camel-
carriage to B. H. The lan led goods cost £4 ss. a ton
from Adelaide The freight by rail would be £6 10s per
ton. On third-class goods a saving of £3 and even £4
can be made by using the river. Unfortunately, there is
a river only now and then.
THE LIGHT COMEDIAN.
BUSKIN : “By Jove, Sock, you ’ve piled on flesh

“ Logo ” : Was told years ago by a Scotch
attorney who lived near Balmoral that the late
Queen Vic. and her Consort were not a happy
couple, and that Albert more than once threatened
to leave his royal wife and live permanently with
his brother in Germany. The limb of the law
longed to have charge of the prospective divorce
proceedings.
THE OLD MACHINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tis a dingj' little office in a western country town,
Where I toil from morn till night to earn my keep ;
Where the dust drives through the doorway from the
highways bare and brown,
And piles up in the passage inches deep.
There I sit behind a screen,
Typing letters —always typing—on the creaking old
machine.
In the blazing heat of summer days the laden teams go
by,
Almost smothered in the clouds of dust that blow ;
And it’s “ Hi there, Satan ! Come up, Snow ! ” I hear the
drivers cry
To the bullocks, plodding heavily and slow.
Then I fold the faded screen,
But in fancy through my mem’ry runs the rhyme of the
machine.
I was wont to think the homestead ways were dull, and
bush-life plain ;
But ’twas freedom, and the mountain-streams were cool;
And I’m longing every day to see the old folks once
again,
But the time goes by, and I’m upon the stool
Forgotten and unseen,
So I send them Christmas greetings written out on the
machine.
Yet there’s one bright ray to cheer me through my weary
daily round ;
Just outside the office-window I can see
Standing tall a id straight, and casting forth its branches
far around
An exile like myself—an old gum tree.
An l it keeps my mem’ry green,
While I’m tapping for my daily bread upon the old
machine.
W.J.W.
Lack of Initiative.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ No,” said Tom, addressing a small but attentive
audience on the verandah of the Lake View ;
“there are some men who don’t know what
gratitood is.”
It was almost a judicial utterance, and coming
from Tom practically concluded the argument;
though Saul was heard to murmur discontentedly,
as if he thought the decision might still be upset
on appeal. He was not noticed, however, and
Tom continued :
“Now look at Harris! Will anyone here say
there could be any gratitood in Harris after the
way he treated me ? ”
“ When was that ? ” asked Saul.
“When was that?” said Tom in an injured
tone. “Why, don’t you remember, when Harris
stood for the Kangarookery ! Wasn’t I his secre-
tary ! Didn’t I get him the best of 800 votes !
Didn’t I work morning, noon and night for seven
weeks, and wasn’t I darned well sick of the whole
business ! And then for a fellow like that to say
I was lacking in inishative.”
“ How did he form that opinion?” said Saul
loftily.
“He never formed it ; he just jumped at it.
Anyhow it was years before I got rightly over
that election. I was kind of dazed afterwards.
Couldn’t collect my wits. For seven weeks I’d
gone the rounds witli Harris ; I knew the people ;
I knew the country. All the lads at the woolshed
said that they’d vote with me, and the chaps at
the sawmills were with me to a man. Then my
brother-in-law, J. J. Jenkins—you know, the
cove that married Kate—he owns all the houses
on the east side of the township, and I tipped him
the wink. And the baker—you know Hayes, the
fellow that married Sal —he owned most of ’em
on the west, and I tipped him the wink ; and my
brother-in-law Jenkins was in with the raisers of
fat stock up the river, and he tipped them the
wink ; and the wheat-growers on the flat told me
straight that they knew nothing about politics,
but if there was one man in the electorate they
respected more than Hayes, it was the man Hayes
would support for Kangarookery.”
“So you tipped them the wink,” said Saul in-
terrupting in a distinctly disrespectful manner.
“That’s not the case,” said Torn. “Hayes
tipped them the wink.
“ Of course Harris’s family and my family were
old friends, and when Harris asked me to stick to
him I promised I would stick to him ; betides,
Harris said he’d get me a Government billet, and
as I wasn’t exactly cut out for work I reckoned
that that would suit me very well.
“ Still, I soon found when I started cuivassin’
for Harris I had the most tremenjus job tint a
white man ever took on. It broke m ; up, it got on
to my nerves, it laid me out, in a manner of speak-
ing ; an’ yet he’s the fellow that will tell you now
that I’m ‘lacking in inishative.’
“It was awful,” said Tom. “Every man,
woman or child we met, whether he was above or
below the use of reason, parent or kiddy, old
or young, he always had the same greeting. He’d
open his mouth at him like a horse with the
lampas, and say, ‘H’ are yuh ? ’ He used to say
that he would insinuate himself into the good
graces of the people, and that all the electors of
Kangarookery were pleased with him inquiring
after their health like, hut it was awful for any
one that was with him always. He got that way
that wherever we went lie always wore that grin,
and I used to be afraid, when I moved a bit in the
trap or turned round sudden, that he would I reak
out with his ‘H’ are yuh?’ And the gibberin’
and the noddin’ got that awful that, cornin’ in of
a night after a hard day’s canvassin’, I used to be
afraid to look at bin:, and even when I wasn’t
lookin’ at him I fancied I could see his jaw
working. And the consequence, of course, was
my nerves got unstrung. It dragged me down,
and yet” (here Tom raised his hand with solemnity)
“that is the man that says I’m lacking in
inishative. Lacking in your grandmother, 1 say.
“The whole thing turned on Wattle Elat;
I could see that plain enough. I had every vote
counted, and I knew that if we could nab the
blokes in Wattle Flat we were right. We left
Wattle Flat till the day before the election, then
we drove aci’oss twenty miles through the timber.
Harris said that he was determined that Wattle
Flat should carry the impression of his virtues
fresh right up to the polling-booth. I know I’ll
carry his bloomin' impression all my life. I’ll
never forget that day in Wattle Flat. It was a
beautiful day The wattles were bloomin’, the
bees were hunimin’, the grass was green, and
them little yeller flowers were shinin’ all over the
ground along the road. But it was a terrible day
for me.
“When we got among the houses it ’ud be,
‘ H’are yuh ? ’ this one, and ‘ H’are yuh ? ’ that
one. Supposin’ we pulled up at a pub. it would
be ‘ H’are yuh ? ’ everyone. If it was only a
bloomin’ Chow diggin’ a potato patch, you’d think
Harris and he had been schoolmates. The grin on
him never used to wear off, and I got to feel like
he was snarlin’ at me, and I fancied every minute
he was going to bite me. It was a hard day’s
work, and I was glad when night came on and we
started for home. I reckoned we were just about
safe, perhaps a vote or two to spare. I was
soothed. Harris’ face settled a little as we got on
the lonely bush road. I was happier than I had
been for weeks, but if I had known what I had to
pass through, what 1 was to suffer for this very
man, I’d have—well, I’d have committed suicide
at any rate. It was a lonely road, and night had set
in when we left the Elat. We were about two miles
out, and we were going slow. Harris was tired,
I was tired, the horse was tired. We were just
about Harris’ Gully (that’s why it is called Harris’
Gully, on account of what happened there that
night). The track is narrow, and there s scrub
all round, and big trees. Then we came to a bit
of open ground. I was listless like at the time,
and I fancy Harris was dozin’ All of a sudden,
it happened.”
“ What happened ? ” asked Saul.
“ I’d rather you’d let me tell my story in my
own way,” said Tom, casting a withering glance
at his interrupter.
“ The timber cracked to the left of us, and two
old-men kangaroos broke through, crossed the
track, and made to get away over the clear
ground. I was startled, and I near fell out of the
trap, when I heard Harris shrieking through his
teeth, ‘H’ are yuh ? ’ At the same time he leaned
forward, pulled the reins out of my hands, cracked
the whip and started the neddy across the patch
in the ways the ’roos had gone.
“At that moment Harris leaned forward, the
wind blew his whiskers aside, the moon shone
through his teeth, and he gibbered at me and
fixed me with glittering eyes and sang out : ‘ You
fool, don’t you know that them gentlemen are
eligible for voters’ certificates?’ ”
“ I suppose you laughed a bit ? ” put in Saul.
“You s’pose wrong. I wasn’t that way in-
clined. My head swam. I saw the moon whirl-
ing in the air. I realised that I was driving
furiously across country with an insane candidate,
and I just fell out of the trap. My head struck
on the metal and the wheels went over me. I
came back to consciousness the day- after the
election.
“Harris? He was found two days'after the
election on a gum stump. He was quite nood,
and was wavin’ his hands to a native bear, and
saying something about being acquainted with
local conditions, and if lie was returned lie would
further the interests of the country while having
due regard to the industries of tli4 town. And
in between times he was saying ‘ H' are yuh ’ to a
locust.”
“But how did the election go?”
“We were beaten by one vote, and when T met
Harris after he recovered I told the stoopid idiot
that our two votes would have put us right if he’d
only stuck to the track and let them ’roos alone.
He just said it was easy to make excuses,
but everybody knew that the election was lost
owing to my lack of inishative in not approaching
them two settlers.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
Australian Treasurer Turner, struggling
with the State Treasurers over the finance tangle,
might have inwardly quoted Tolstoy: “The
State is the evil.”
Announced by the Government represen-
tative in the Senate that the Deakin Cabinet will
claim a Federal capital territory of 1000 square
miles. It ought to claim 5000 square miles, but
even 1000 is something to go on with.
Holland, after a long course of Freetrade,
has now a Bill before its Parliament for the estab-
lishment of a Protective tariff in a small way.
There are very few worshippers of the Freetrade
Joss left now, and this threatens to make one less.
Wilks, N.S.W. M.H.R. for Londonderry
and the Yellow Pup and Dill Macky’s calves, in
the House : “ The man who raises sectarianism is
a diabolical scoundrel.” “A diabolical scoun-
drel ! ” Thanks to Mr. Wilks for the description.
Irvine and Shiels and Bent got on
famously last year; the rush to go somewhere
which didn’t enjoy the blessings of their rule was
overpowering. In the latter six months Victoria’s
losses by excess of sea-departures over arrivals
reached 7994.
Chief Justice Madden of Victoria has let
in one undesirable Chinaman for what looks like
a very weak reason. The customs officer started
to dictate to this Chow 50 words in English as a
test, but as the Chow couldn’t comprehend any
one of the first ten words he left off in disgust.
The Court held that he should have read the other
40 words, even though Asia was gazing at him like
a blank wall and plainly understood nothing, and
Ah Foo comes in on that technicality.
The “employers’ conference” must feel
pretty bad at not being able to blame the Labor
party for putting into the Federal Constitution
the power to legislate with regard to industrial
troubles. Except Trenwith, perhaps, there wasn’t
a single Labor man in the Convention ; and it was
not Trenwith who proposed this item—it was
J- H. Howe, a member of the Conservative party
of S- Aus., and a mining director. When one
reflects upon the constitution of the Convention,
one can’t help marvelling at the broad liberalism
of the thing which it produced.
FIRED OUT.
THE INTERJECTOR (who was a Methodist clergyman): “I shall only leave
this public meeting when I choose, or when expelled.”
MR. DOWIE: “Would you like to be carried out?"
THE INTERJECTOR: “If you do carry me out I shall take steps-”
Two ushers then seized the clergyman by the shoulders and started to
bustle him down the stone steps leading into Swanston-street.
Boston (U.S.A.)has rejected 80 Yorkshire
immigrants, as they might become a charge upon
the State. The’Murkans object to Britain dump-
ing its halt, lame and blind on their shores.
The Six Hatters case, which supplied George
Reid with so much platform pabulum, was not a
circumstance to the Bostonians.
“R.” writes :
It is incontestable that every Englishman and likewise
every Australian should abhor the Russians and maffick
for their defeat. Do they not live upon such degradirigly
filthy food as candles, train-oil and decaying mammoths
and are they not strangers to soap? Do they not main-
tain oppression and cruelty to the lower races ? And isn’t
there gold in their country, just as there was in Boer-
land ?
Harry Allan, brother of Frank Allan “ the
bowler of a century,” gave to a meeting of
Victorian public servants the following descrip-
tion of what the Public Service M.L.A. ought to
be:—“ I think we should select a man from out-
side the service. He should be a lawyer for
preference-one that will not behave himself too
well.”
N.S.W. Government resisted the tempta-
tion to make another political appointment to the
Sydney Water and Sewerage Board, or to continue
to sanction the scandalous job by which G. H.
Reid appointed the incompetent Jacob Garrard
to the post. An expert engineer of the Harbors
and Rivers Branch, T. W. Keele, has now been
put at the head of the board.
One of the most fearful results of the
Morgan Government’s retrenchment transpired at
Rockhampton (Q.) during the hearing of the Mac-
donald case. Judge Power, being in want of a pen,
had to send his Associate in quest of one. “ This
is what comes, ” remarked His Honor tragically,
“of having no tipstaff !” And the great heart of
Bananaland quivered with sympathetic indigna-
tion.
The Tory party in Federal politics is
striking some snags. The Melbourne election, at
which Malcolm M’Eacharn beat Dr. Maloney by
a very narrow majority, has been declared void,
and the matter is to be fought out afresh. Also
big landlord Blackwood seems in a fair way to lose
his Riverina seat to J. M. Chanter on the ground
that a large number of votes for Chanter were
wrongly declared informal.
Britain’s alien population is making itself
a nuisance in a new way. Recruiting officers
complain that they are pestered with applications
from indigent aliens for admission to the militia,
membership of which has a cash value. Extra
precautions are suggested as necessary to prevent
the militia being swamped by shambling Russian
Jews in the clo’ trade and all manner of miscel-
laneous aliens of dubious fighting capacity.
Another “Federal extravagance” lie
knocked on the head. Last December’s election
(including the N.S.W. State Referendum) only
cost £46,119 for 1,893,586 electors, as against
£56,331 which the thriftless States spent in
taking the opinions of 974,594 voters in ’Ol. The
economical Philp Government actually spent
£12,342 in ’Ol to do less work than the Common-
wealth Government accomplished for £6515.
Tax-dodging in Queensland isn’t nearly as
profitable as it used to be. The State Govern-
ment having indicated that its dealings with the
looal government bodies must be on a strictly
business basis, the latter are beginning to
give hints to the same effect to their own con-
stituents. Under district court warrants the
Toowong town council the other day auctioned
47 pieces of land on which rates hadn’t been paid
for years.
The Stinking Fish cry travels far. Thus
the Kansas City Journal :
Australia is rapidly losing population because of
business demoralisation caused by the Government
catering to organised labor. Australia seems to be
almost as badly union-ridden as Chicago.
Chicago, by the way, has lately increased in
population more quickly than any other city in
the world, and is the place least afflicted with
“business demoralisation.” So there’s hope for
Australia yet.
George Reid yes-noes in a pitiably clumsy
way nowadays. When he was raging in the
Representatives against the clause under which
the Six Hatters were not excluded, a query was
thrown at him as to why he supported the clause
when the Bill whs before Parliament. The Owner
of the Dog blandly replied that he only supported
it “as a matter of negotiation.” Which remark
seemed about as full of meaning as if he had sup-
ported the clause as a matter of Dutch cheese or
on account of the equator.
The history of the but-
ton industry in the United
States evidences the fallacy
of the Foreign-traders’ con-
tention that Protection in-
evitably means increased
cost to the consumer. Prior
to the M'Kinley tariff the
United States relied ex-
clusively upon imports for
its button supply. On the
imposition of the duty of
30 per cent, the price of
buttons immediately leaped
from 30 cents to 80 cents
per gross, and remained at
that for awhile—until local
factories were established.
Then the price rapidly
dropped until the buttons
that used to cost 30 cents
per gross under Freetrade
are sold at from 18 cents to
25 cents per gross. Result
of the duty—cheaper but-
tons than before the duty,
and employment for some
10,000 workmen in the fac-
tories alone. Australia has
already struck this same
experience with matches
and various other things.
All the members of the
Legislative Council of
Papua are Government offi-
, cials, and any ordinance
the Administration deems desirable is passed
without dissent. The Australian Government
should see that a reasonable number of non-official
members of the community are appointed to the
Council. It might result in better advice being
given to His Excellency than under the present
one-man arrangement.
Jawbone Neild is lecturing the Sydney
dailies for their persistent allusions to J. H.
Symon as “ Leader of the Opposition ” in the
Senate. Jawbone styles himself as “ Senior
Senator,” because he secured the largest number
of votes polled at the recent elections. He even
styles himself “senior among all the members of
Parliament in His Majesty’s dominions,” or some-
thing like that. The time will probably come
when Neild will rush out wjldly in his cocked hat
and style himself senior archangel.
Cabled that in Johannesburg, under free
and enlightened British rule, our colored fellow-
subject is to be put in gaol if he is found walking
on the footpath. As an inferior being, our
colored fellow-subject, who is supposed to have
been set free under the British flag, is to take a
subservient position in the gutter. Will Spruce
Myth, who is so angry because we don’t give the
nigger all the rights he is supposed to enjoy else-
where under the blessed Flag, please make a
note of our colored fellow-subject ?
AT THE COMMONWEALTH CIRCUS.
The feature of Mr. Keid’s speech was its strong de-
nunciation of the merchants of Sydney who met the
other day and denounced advanced legislation and the
Labor party. The point of interest to members was
what the deliverance was to be taken to mean. Mr.
Reid at the elections cut himself off from the Labor
party, and after the elections the Labor party, at a
caucus, declared that they could not accept a coalition
with him at the head. Mr. Reid, himself, now attacks
the merchants in Sydney, who denounce the Labor
party. Mr. Reid will probably await developments. This
seems at present to be his aim .—Daily paper.
Ist. Spectator: “My word, ain’t that Reid good
at them somersaults ? ”
2nd. Spectator : “ Yes, and can’t he keep it up.
That’s 298 I’ve counted, and ’e don’t seem
likely to stop.”
The attitude of the National Ass in respect
to the Adelaide trams is that, whereas it will agree
to the State buying them, it will not consent to
the State electrifying the system or working it
afterwards, as the Ass dreads “an increase in the
influence of the Trades Hall party.” As the Ass
absolutely dominates the Legislative Council in
S.A.. it will be seen that the prospects of complete
nationalisation are not rosy. The idea is to lease
the trams to a private company. Then instead of
being horse trams they will be Ass trams.
N.S.W. Public Works Department will
shortly, it is reported, be placed in charge of a
commission so far as construction works are con-
cerned. The commission will have the same inde-
pendence as the Railway Commission, and will be
instructed to put an end to all political influence
in the carrying out of State works. There is,
however, no proposal to do away with the political
influence which secures the initiation of unneces-
sary works to conciliate the member for Dog
Hollow ; and that is the greater evil.
Little while ago N.S.W. Electric Tele-
graph Department was presided o\er by a
superintendent (£BOO a year), an assistant-superin-
tendent (£7OO a year), and a general manager
(£OOO a year). To-day the same work is per-
formed by one plain manager, an old-time
operator, at about £5OO a year, and the general
public fails to note any difference in the working
of the department, except that things are going
slightly better. The Federation is certainly
strong on administrative economy.
W.A. Laborites are not resting. Labor
nominees will contest 36 at least of the 50 seats in
the State House. Even Bunbury, sacred to
Groperdom as the birthplace of Bigjohn, is in
danger of desecration, whilst Northam and
Albany, two old strongholds of the reactionaries,
are being assailed with fair prospects of success.
Under the new re-distribution there are 16 gold-
fields seats, and 14 of these are certainties for
Labor. The other two (Boulder and Menzies) are
held by Ministers, and a Minister’s position,
solidly fortified by loan money, is a pretty tough
kopje to rush.
“War E.” wants to wake up N.S.W.
Lands Office:—
A little more about that Ganmain Reserve (N.S.W.).
Something under half of it will be available for selection
within a few days, and already applications are pouring
in from all parts of this state, Victoria, and even South
Australia. It is ideal agricultural land, covered with a
luxuriant growth of grass, on which a few sheep are lost.
There is an ominous silence concerning the bigger por-
tion of this reserve, and if somebody does not soon give
the Lands Department a vigorous kick it will fall asleep
on its desk whilst a foreign financial co. sneaks away
with 20,000 acres of splendid country. Strange that the
Lands Department fails to see how much better for the
country it is to establish 30 families in place of one
boundary-rider! But dust blinds a lot of people some-
times.
.Nicholas Hawken, M.L.C., states what is
exactly the opposite to a fact in a letter on the
shearing labor question to Sydney Telegraph :
The A.W.U. is the grouping of the nomadic system of
shearing of times fast going by, and that of the M.S.U. is
the grouping of the resident system of shearing, which is
now stationary, and a true advance on the old nomadic
system, which was principally romantic in its lambing-
down incidents, and only defensible under uncivilised con-
ditions. The M.S.U. seems to be composed of resident
settlers and sons of settlers.
The truth is that the M.S.U. was directly orga-
nised by a shearing “contractor ” (under the con-
tract system a team travels round from shed to
shed taking off the clip at an agreed rate, the men
being paid weekly wages by the contractor),
whilst it is the A.W.U. which is mainly recruited
from the stationary worker who relies upon a
month or two’s shearing to help him through the
year.
“Marque Reel” : I think the W.A. Labor-
party is making a mistake in opposing Minea
Minister Gregory at the coming elections. Gregory
during his term of office has done more for the
worker in a practical way than any other M.P. in.
Australia. With his public batteries hundreds of
men have been enabled to make a good living out
of shows that they would have otherwise been
starved out of. He has also proved that State
enterprise can be carried on at a profit, even after
reducing charges to customers—in some cases more
than 50 per cent. I recently heard him say that
it was his ambition to see miners working then
own shows and keeping the money in the country
instead of sending the profits to London. I paid
40s. per ton for crushing ; then after the State:
battery was erected, had it done for 14s. Gregory
is a democrat with a tendency towards socialism,
and should not be opposed by the worker.
If the Age does not want to completely
lose prestige as a director-general of Victorian,
politics it should stop trusty henchman J. L.
Dow from standing for Parliament any more.
Dow goes out to brave the storm of every general;
election held in Victoria, and the other day
thought he had a “sure thing ” in the Donald and
Swan Hill seat vacated by Agent-General Taver-
ner. But Dow went down even worse than usual,
with bottom place among the three candidates,
and despite the usual good whoop-up by the Age.
When that paper finally alienated the working
man, and made a bid for the support of the Argus.
farmers, it made the mistake of its life, and if it
wants to cover up that mistake it had better start
by muzzling Dow and chaining him to the desk on
which he churns out his agricultural articles.
Dow’s cake is dough.
Perry, N.S.W. Minister for Education, is
trying to inculcate a spirit of self-reliance. The
Sydney Telegraph reports him thus :
Mr. Perry says that he always tries to instil into them
(school children) a spirit of independence and self-help.
As an instance of this, he mentions that applications have
frequently been received from teachers for appliances to
enable object lessons to be taught, but he has always in-
formed the applicants that the better plan was for the
children to obtain the funds by holding some sort of
entertainment.
This is very proper, as the rising generation will
need all its self-help to meet the obligations
incurred by Mr. Perry and his colleagues. But
couldn’t the Minister exercise his influence over
the rest of the Cabinet and get it to have a scrap
or two of self-reliance? If the teacher could show
his scholars the adjacent bridge which the
Government built without running to Bull for the
money, that would be something like an object
lesson.
Spruce Myth, at Sydney women’s branch
of the Empire League, the other day :
Australians must, if they desired the welfare of the
Empire, show respect for the rights and feelings of their
fellow-subjects. The late Queen had guaranteed to the
people of India, at the time of the peace treaty of
Lucknow, that her Indian subjects should henceforth
enjoy equal privileges with all the other subjects of the
Empire. The people of Australia had belied that
promise, and treated the Indian people as unfit to mix
with the Anglo-Saxon race.
Well, when Biitain itself carries out Queen
Victoria’s promise, and allows its Indian subjects
to “enjoy equal privileges” with other subjects,
of her Empire, it will be time enough for
Australia to think about it. At present, while
Britain declares that its Indian subject is such an
inferior person as to be unworthy even of a voice
in the management of his own country, Australia
cannot be blamed for thinking that he is an
inferior person, and refusing to be seen in his
company. In fact, Australia is loyal enough to
believe that Britain knows its Indian subject
much better than Spruce Myth does.

ALGY : “And yet, after all, my dear, they are-
not so rare as one might he led to imagine.
Why, I myself have HEARD of a lady in
Waverley whose second eldest sister had one
not more than eight years ago.”
“ Marque Reel ” from Kalgoorlie (W.A.) :
The Kalgoorlie Miner has been giving Prime Minister
Deakin advice re the encouragement of immigration, and
its first cry is “ Down with Protection.” Now, this is
what puzzles me. I have been working in W.A. for some
years. This extra-protected State is the best of the
Australias for the worker, yet every year some of
my mates leave here for still more heavily-protected
Maoriland, and after getting there they advise their
former mates to come. These are not the ne’er-do-wells ;
they are the men who have put in a few years
stacking up some beans, and now want bo go to the best
place to make use of the vegetables in question. It
makes me think sometimes that there is something in
Protection, after all.

Liver Complaint, Indiges=
tion and General
Weakness all Succumb to
VITADATIO
Dear Sir, —I wish to add my testimony to the value of
VITADATIO. For over five years I was a great sufferer
from Liver Complaint, Indigestion, and general Weak-
ness ; I was unable to follow my usual occupation, and
for three years had been under several medical men ; I
have also taken courses of almost all the well-known
patent me Jicines without any beneficial results. Whilst
living at Maryborough, about two years ago, I heard of
the wonders being performed through the agency of
VITADATIO and, after making enquiries, I decided to
give it a trial, which I did, with the result that at the
present time I am fully restored to health and feel it my
duty to let others know what VITADATIO has done for
me.
I will be glad to answer any enquiries about my case
personally or by letter, which must have stamped
addressed envelope enclosed.
I remain yours gratefully,
WILLIAM STEWART DRUMMOND.

Premier See would have earned more than a
little approbation had he called the N.S.W.
Assembly together to rescind the resolutions under
which the Public Works Committee goes on
flouting public opinion and grabbing from the
Treasury. The seven members plead that they
must keep on investigating impossible schemes as
Parliament directed the investigations to take
place, and thus the simplest way out would be for
Parliament to meet again and quash what is
admittedly a scandalous imposition. On the
other hand, if the Committee sincerely wished to
end the costly humbug, enough members could
voluntarily retire to leave no quorum. As things
are going, the £69 a month drawn by each member
for compiling reports that will not be read, and
that can have no effect if read, stands as an in-
dictment both of the Ministry and the Committee.
Retrenchment of a few clerks lias no meaning
while the gang of seven, with £l7 a week each,
faces the public. The Assembly members of the
committee draw Parliamentary salaries as well.
A mild reaction having set in against the
brutal treatment to which Victorian public ser-
vants have been subjected by the Iceberg Govern-
ment, Premier Bent is beginning to hedge. He
has caused it to be put around in a muffled sort of
way that he is not averse to allowing the public
servants their increments this year. During the
late race week in Melbourne he sent out a
memorandum to the heads of departments asking
them to arrange a half-holiday for the staff. Also,
he is busy flying a kite in respect to the re-engage-
ment of some of the engine men who were dis-
missed from the railway service in consequence of
the strike. All this is happening just at the time
when the public servants are thinking hard over
the stamp of man to be sent to Parliament to
represent them. A meeting of the service decided
that whoever was elected should sign the Labor
pledge, and Thomas Beef would fain persuade the
service to think better of that.
Attention is directed to the excellence of the
metal polish Solarine. This is recognised as the leading
metal polish in the United States. By using Solarine less
labor and material are required to polish metals than
with any other substance, and the result is a beautiful
lustre, which is permanent. It has the advantage of not
wasting by evaporation, and contains no grit or other
harmful substances. Messrs. N. Guthridge, Ltd., 71

The Maori system of land titles (as many
as 200 owners may be concerned in a quarter-acre
section) is the brown man’s best protection from
the importunities of the land-hungry white.
Much good land is still held by the Maoris in the
north island, between Hawke’s Bay and the Bay of
Plenty, that would have long ago been mopped up
but for the impossibility of finding half the owners
sober and of one mind, or even of finding out who
half the owners are.
According to a cablegram from London :
In reply to a deputation, Lord Milner said he would
stake his reputation that for every 10,000 colored laborers
imported to the Transvaal 10,000 whites would be added
to the population in three years.
It is a pity Milner hasn’t something more valu-
able than his reputation to stake. Let him look
at the adjacent Natal and see how things
worked out there. In the last year for which
figures are available, 1900-1901, Natal’s white
population diminished by 1130, while its Asiatic
population increased by 4016. The Asiatic isn’t
finding work for the white man in Natal; instead,
he has got to the point where he feels capable of
crowding the white man out.
Pumpkin Smith’s scoff that B. R. Wise
“couldn’t get an elective seat in the N.S.W.
Parliament,” is a clumsy lie. Wise represented
one representative for 11 years and gave it up to go
among the Fossils and get them to put through his
Arbitration Bill (which they did, and the Fossils
have been kicking themselves in a mild and pre-
historic manner ever since). The unreliable state-
ment also recalls a bygone election incident,
when Pumpkin urged a N.S.W. electorate to
return him instead of Barton, on the ground that
Barton was too great a statesman, and too much
interested in the welfare of all Australia, to keep
a constant and efficient eye on the local culvert.
On the other hand, Pumpkin assured the electors
that he (Pumpkin) was just the humble parish
insect whose eye would be glued on the local
culvert all the time. The Pumpkin Smiths of
Australia get many elective seats in that manner,
while the man with a big outlook fails, through
inability to get down to the Pumpkin level.
The Tory Arcus on the Labor members in the
Australian Parliament:—
The Homes bear the aspect of all that is buoyant and
hopeful and self-satisfied. How can a young man avoid
being pleased with himself who has been redeemed from
the slavery of seven-and-a-half hours’ manual work per
day, raised to a salary of £8 per week, and instructed
that he has nothing to do but wear his Sunday clothes
all the week and assist to make laws? Officially the
young Labor member holds that Australia is going to the
dogs, and that there can be nothing satisfactory about it
till everything is changed. But he cannot assume an
appropriate appearance of gloom.
Which is a cad and bounder’s way of throwing
political mud. Subtract from the £7 15s. a wee k
the Australian M.P. draws, election and travel -
ling expenses and cadging exactions, and there is
a very bare living wage left—a poorer wage on the
whole than the man would get in a mine or an
office. The Argus knows this as well as The
Bulletin does. But the Tory crowd in Australia
has no imagination, no education, and little sense
of decency ; it is always justifying Higinbotham’s
gibe—“ the wealthy lower orders.”
*
Some people are hard to please. Though his co.
got an award in its favor which has been most
loyally obeyed, the chairman of the Broken Hill
Proprietary Co. said, at the half-yearly share-
holders’ meeting in Melbourne, the other day,
that “it is a grave question whether legislative
interference between employer and employed,
such as the Arbitration Act, serves much good
purpose.” Yet it is a dead certainty that, but for
this Act (and the hope of it even before it came),
there would have been a strike at the Broken Hill
mines long ago. Before the Labor party got into
Parliament with strength enough to push through
this Act, the B.H. Prop, mine was laid up through
strikes three times within four years—once for
four months at a stretch. And the Government
had to “ interfere ” then just as much as it “ inter-
feres ” now ; in one case alone the “ interference”
cost over £20,000 for special police protection,
courts, etc. It always has been the case, curiously
enough, that the men who gibber most about
“ State interference between employer and em-
ployed ” are the first to whistle for the police when
a strike occurs.


A significant sentence from the speech of
Henry Butler in handing over Iceberg Irvine’s
reward for bis political labors on behalf of the
Tory element of Victoria : “You did what was
required.” Exactly, He did “what was re-
quired” by the Fatmen, and the Fatmen duly
paid him. Irvine saved his face to the last. He
took the illuminated address and his wife took the
cheque for £2050. It somehow recalls a far-back
episode in Australian history. A great, calm,
hairy “constitutional” statesman was once
offered a cash testimonial when departing for a
holiday, and refused it with a shocked expression.
His soul was outraged. But be allowed the purse
to be given to a female relative, and it was duly
presented on the ship as they were leaving. Ihe
statesman made some appropriate and digmhed
remarks about the Constitution. Then as the
vessel got away a slight scuffle was .observed
between the great calm statesman and his female
relative. The pillar of integrity was recovering
the money.

Most people in S. Australia seem to have
been born or arrived in 1850 or thereabouts. Ex-
Premiers Kingston, Cockburn, and Holder all
date from that year ; so does Gordon, who held
one or two Ministries up; Bonython, of the
Advertiser, is 18 months older ; Premier Jenkins
came along in 1851; and Thomas, of the Register,
the same year.
HEARING AND HOW TO KEEP IT.
An instructive article on “ How to preserve the
hearing, and how to cure Deafness ” appears in
the last number of the “Review of Ear, Nose and
Throat Diseases.” Anyone whose hearing is fail-
ing should send for a free copy of this Medical
Journal, a number of copies having been sent
out from London, England. All you require to
do in order to obtain a copy is to send your name
and address to : —“ Review ” c/o Box 241, G.P.0.,
Sydney. With the “Review” there is also a
report form by means of which anyone can obtain
free advice by post.*
The Inky Way.
It is hoped by the tired directors and shareholders in
the New Zealand Times that the appointment ot
Sydney Jenkinson, sub-editor of Melbourne Argus, as
manager and literary supervisor of Wellington’s big
morning daily, will send that most unsatisfactory paper
ahead. Mr. Jenkinson is to receive £7OO a year for three
years, and £lOOO thereafter. The Times has only paid
three dividends in goodness knows how many years. It
nas always been unfortunate, and as a literary production
it is the most wooden in the State. Abie men don’t get
sufficient inducement to stay on its staff, and even very
mediocre reporters look in for a month or so only to skip
elsewhere. Once upon a time it was thought that a cer-
tain journalist would stay because he was going to marry
the editor s daughter, but a few weeks after the wedding
he also flitted to another billet.

NEW ARRIVAL : "By Jove. What a magnificent sunset. What a glorious effect.”
OLD HAND: "My oath; it's BLANKY fine, isn’t it?”
Perth Morning Herald has a reporter who is let loose
on mail steamers now and again. He turns up in an hour
or two with a series of interviews, mostly with pursers
and stewards. Herald the other day solemnly printed a
column of the views of a cook on one of the French boats ;
cookey assured anxious Westralians that there wasn’t
going to be any trouble in China. Another time it had
an “ interesting interview ” with a German ship’s barber
on the fiscal question—only in the paper he was described
as “ one of the qfficers” of the G.M.S. Sauerkraut.

“ 0.K.” : Wrongly stated that bright, seniceable
pressman Donnelly “ developed consumption when
roughing it in the service of the Argus.” He was cough-
ing badly before he came to Melbourne from Shepparton
(Vic.) and got a position on the Argus staff, after which
his health improved for a while under the influence, ap-
parently, of a quack medicine. Then the night work
began to tell on him, arid finally the sick man retired to
an Adelaide sanatorium to see what six months’ rest
would do for him.

Alleged that the reporter of a New York “yellow”
journal got this memo, of instructions one day from his
chief: —“ A prominent wealthy young fellow named
Stuart was up in the West Side police-court for drunken-
ness this morning. He pleaded to have his name kept
out of the newspapers for fear that his mother would hear
of it. She has heart trouble, and he says the shock would
kill her. Go over to her house at ——■, West Seventy-
second-street, and tell her about it.. See if you can’t kill
her. We need news.” Fortunately, so the story goes,
the lady turned out to be at Syracuse.

The Tientsin (China) Courier is a model of caution.
Recently an enormous fish of some unknown species was
caught off the coast, and was cut up and sold. The
Courier stated that three hundred people who had eaten of
it died suddenly, and many others were seriously ill. Then
it remarked, with a commendable desire not to jump at
conclusions, that “ possibly the fish was poisonous.” The
S.M. Herald should hire that Tientsin Courier man. He
is just the grave, thinkful man that the Herald wants.
“G.”: “Jimmy” Thompson’s chat con-
cerning the old days when there was no
cable, and the mail steamer brought the
monthly budget ot English news to Albany
ou oe telegraphed from there (8., 25/2/’O4), recalls the
time when the budget was landed at Circular Quay, Sydney.
There was great rivalry then between the Fairfax faction
and the newly-formed news agency, Greville and Co., and
all sorts of dodges were played to get first hold of the tele-
graph wires. On one occasion Langley, then shipping
reporter on the Herald, hired a horse to ride from the
Quay to the old telegraph office (then over tailor Savage’s
shop), and Greville s stock fell considerably as William
mounted on the wrong side of his moke. But Greville’s
agent, little A. J. Gray, was equal to the occasion, and
darting in front of Langley’s horse, he suddenly opened
his umbrella under its very nose. The horse made a
backward plunge that landed it and its rider in the
hp r fishoH nd b f e A ore kangJey and his precious packet could
telegraph nuntlr? char ‘ ered a cab and reached the

I had thrust on me “ The Gov.-General arriving ” (at the

“Arrival of Gov.-General” (at A.N.A. sports), and
“ Arrival of Vice-Regal party ” (at I forget what), not to
mention “ The Gov.-General coming up the terrace," etc.
Each picture is the same picture of a small man stepping
out of his carriage, and a selection of fat persons pulling
olf their hats hastily. That’s why I’m tired. Dash the

Several London papers have lately adopted the “hidden
fortune” game as a method of advertising (it has been,
in a way, imitated by the Sydney cycling people, who
offer to give away cheques in the street to persons
producing one of their advertisement). Paris Matin in-
troduced the method in 1903, hiding vouchers for £1000;
by reading a story in the paper you got hints as to the
whereabouts of the valuables. Since then several London
papers have followed suit. The proprietors buried the
money by night in a lonely part of England, and the
serial story about a hidden treasure which commenced
immediately after supplied the indications in an obscure
way, and people who read the indications wrongly dug up
several counties in quest of the loot till it looked like a
general revival of agriculture. The game is dead now in
the country of its origin ; the French police stopped it as
a lottery.
THE TEMPTER.
MURPHY: “ Y’ old scoundrelsh — y' fill ’em up's
fash’s I empty ’em. I’s my impresshion y’
want to get me drunk — (hie)!”
(I “ Nym ” tells what may be truth or may be Sapphira :
“Thewai’s of the Australian author are not all beans.
Joe Furphy ('Tom Collins’), the Vic. literary iron-
moulder, tank-sinker and bush-whacker, has had his
little troubles since his book, ‘ Such is Life,’ swamped the
booksellers. Joe has been the recipient of letters from
the four quarters of the prlobe. Some writers praise,
others blame, but the multitude have written to tell the
author how they would have worked out the plot if they
had written the book. The worst trouble was in store
when the new year was born, for Joe became the recipient
of a proposal of marriage from an admirer, who availed
herself of the Leap Tear privilege to lay her wealth and
herself at the author’s feet. His ready pen lagged con-
siderably as he wrote declining the honor, owing to the
trifling fact that he had a good wife living and daughters
old enough, but too modest, to propose themselves.”

“Scribo ”: Andrew Bent’s Tasmanian newspaper,
published in 1817, was animated by these beautiful
aspirations. “We desire to encourage the cloudless
Eromise of rectified communion, rejecting each effusion,
owever splendid, of degenerated ouriositv and perverted
genius, of misanthropical acerbity and calumnious retro-
spection.” But it was an anti-climax to conclude ; “We
hope to publish with the aid of a man and a boy.”
• * * *
Donald, who is representing the Sydney D.T. at the
China war (he had a position on the China Mail, Hong-
aonfi', and offered to go forward at his own expense),
writes in his first war letter :—“ In order to be able to
move with the troops and view the engagements I set
out for Tokio to-day. Thence my movements will be
guided by the sword, and I will make with all speed for
where the war is thickest.” This high-flown but well-
meaning youth will probably find that, in that country of
tremendous distances, war is about as “thick” as two
blades of grass in a square-mile paddock, and he will get
there much more reliably if he is guided by the victual-
waggon instead of the sword.
You can differentiate between a mean and a generous
district by the pars, in the local newspaper. The district
where John Smith “left at this office some magnificent
specimens of the Bon Chretien pear ” is all right ; the
place where “we were shown yesterday by Mr. Tim
Jones a very large watermelon,” etc., is to be avoided.

Significant headings from an English paper—and a
friendly paper, too :

libels, occur in the headings.

“ Shellback ”: Melbourne paper war maps are all
wrong. The editors should walk down the street when
they can find time and visit Donne’s, where a fine chart
of the scene of operations can be obtained for about a
dollar. Also they might give some hard-up sailor man
acquainted with the locality a job to keep them posted
up in details, and thus avoid making ludicrous errors.

Sydney H. Jenkinson, who has been day sub. on the
Melb. Argus for over 20 years, goes over to Wellington
(Maoriland) to manage and edit the Times. Jenkinson
came to Victoria from the boiling springs country, where
he had been a schoolmaster. He was a valuable sub., and
built up a great reputation during the boom by throwing
out good copy to make room for big, highly remunerative
advertisements. The management used to say “ Jenkin-
son is the only man who seems to be able to make room
for all the advertisements offering.” And it was true ;
there was nothing ever written that. Jenkinson wasn’t
capable of rejecting to make space for a land sale notice.
A brother of his was appointed to the Maoriland Legis-
lative Council by Seddon,
“Alcinous”: The brightest gem in Australian news-
paperdom is undoubtedly the Brisbane Telegraph.
Editor Woolnough is an ex-parson, with a capacity for
metaphysics and a consequent knack of talking in
parables. He fights terrible battles with himself in his
leaders as to what is crime and why education is
demoralising. Sometimes he issues from the contest
victorious, with his victim (himself) underneath ; some-
times he is badly beaten by the victor (himself) on top,
but generally the struggle ends in a draw, both of him
being injured. The paper claims the largest circu-
lation in Queensland. Giving the devil his due, the
average issue would contain the latest news if it only
came out two days before its headed date, though as
regards its anti-Federation wail, it has not yet reached
Ist Jan., 1901, and its black-labor politics are awav back
in the dark ages. No special articles by local writers are
allowed to desecrate its pages, but it has about the best
pair of scissors in Australia, and its gum-pot is like the
widow’s cruse and faileth not.
THE PROTEST OF THE PIPE AND GLASS CLUB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]

perfume,
We were drinking-, in the golden even glow ;
But, alas, the company was not what it used to be

And our President arose and said : “ Brethren, I suppose
You know well what we are here assembled for?
We wish strongly to protest”—here he struck his grand
old chest—
'•’Gainst this cruel Japanese and Russian War.
“ When the nations go to fight with their bayonets
shining bright,
And their trumps and drums, and banners flaunting gay,
Bo they know, or do they care, for the woe they cause
elsewhere,
And the humble little industries they slay?
“I, myself, as you know all, earn a pittance sure, if
sinall,
Writing yarns re birds and reptiles, and so forth,
But no paper will from me purchase Natural History
When Unnatural History’s making in the North.
“ Our friend Tityrus looks pale as he sits and sips his
ale—
Well he may, for when the sword-blades rasp and ring,
And the armies fight and bleed (in the papers) who would
read
(Or would print) his ‘ Gentle Art of Gardening.’
“ There’s another friend I see—who will buy his Poetry
When the wild beast on the readers is let loose,
When the Press shall shout and shriek and shall like a
shambles reek
For his rhymes of love and dove who will find use ?
“ VV’hen the nations go to fight with their bayonets
shining bright,
To themselves it may conceivably be plaj'—
But, alas, my friends, I fear they care nothing for us here,
Nor for all the humble industries they slay.”
In the low-roofed tavern-room there was silence sad and
gloom,
Yet, somehow, I half expected blood would flow—
But, ah me, the company was not what it used to ba
When the Pipe and Glass Club met there years ago.

THE POET MULLIGAN.
[For The Bulletin.]
Once on a time there lived a man
Who went by the name of Mulligan ;
This Mulligan had a poet’s brow,
And a poet’s soul—and he owned a cow.
Now Mulligan’s verse, it took the bun
(The cow he stole from a neighboring run);
It is true that he wasn’t a bard of fame,
But he poured forth verses just the same.
One day the cow to his humpy strode,
And chewed and swallowed his master ode—
The ode into which he had thrown his soul—
She chewed and swallowed that great work whole.
And then she died, and her soul arose
To the place where the soul of a good cow goes,
And there she knocked, and a Presence cried :
“ You can’t come here with a pome inside.
“ We don’t object to your bovine soul,
But we do to Mulligan’s—part or whole ;
You must go and get frizzled and grilled and fried
Till of Mulligan’s soul you’re purified.”
Then the soul of the cow went down below
To the red-hot spot where the coal-fires glow,
And the Ghoul who there at the portal sits
Said : “ Mulligan can’t come here in bits."
Then the soul of the cow with a logic keen
Said: “ What are you givin’ us ? What d’ye mean ?
The soul of Mulligan, whole, was throwed
Into that chewed-up master ode.”
But the Ghoul he laughed and said : “ If so,
He never had very much soul to throw ;
It won’t pan out a grain to the cow,
And to smelt it out wouldn’t pay nohow."
Then the soul of the cow began to moo,
And said : “ Pray, then, what am I to do 1"
And the Ghoul he said with a frizzly hiss :
“ Dunno 1 Dunno 1 But gerrout of this 1 "
Then the cow she turned disconsolate,
And wandered away from the blazing gate—
And that was a hundred years ago,
And what became of her I don’t know.

Constipation.
More chronic disorders are traceable to constipa-
tion than all the others combined. It is like
stuffing up the sewers of a great city. All the
impurities are forced back into the system, caus-
ing an endless amount of suffering, weakening the
stomach and preventing the proper digestion and
assimilation of food. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills stand alone as the best remedy for constipa-
tion. They get at the cause, cleansing and purify-
ing the entire system. They assist Nature in the
discharge of all her functions. Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills are a positive and permanent
cure for biliousness, indigestion, constipation,
headaches, sallow complexion, liver and kidney
troubles, piles, pimples, boils and blotches, and for
female ailments. Packed in amber bottles, and
sold throughout Australasia.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
“O.K.”: “Mud” cricket shows, firstly, the
individual resourcefulness or helpfulness of the batsmen,
and, secondly, it marks a distinction between the charac-
ter of the English and Australian fieldsman. The latter,
ic s-ems to me, is the more cool and alert when chances
are frequently happening in unexpected places. He is
not so easily flustered as the other man when the un-
looked-for chance comes straight towards him, but he is
not quite so quick (experienced?) in judging the flight of
a ball for which he has to turn and run. Six and a-half
innings in Test matches have been played at Melbourre
this season on a wet, treacherous wicket, Australia
getting the better scores because the visitors missed the
greater number of catches. As regards the howling
strength of the two teams, there was practically nothing
to choose. Sixty odd wickets were taken alto-
gether, and there were only seven individual scores of
more than 20 runs. Trumper and Tyldesley, and, in a
less degree, Foster showed a distinct superiority over the
other men. Tyldesley, the only batter who achieved
double figures at each attempt, made one score of 62
without getting any concessions from the field. Trumper
had the highest aggregate—74, 35, and a “duck”—but
he was twice let off before he had begun to knock up his
74. Noble (31), Duff (31), Foster (30) and Hopkins (25)
were each of them favored by exceptional luck, neverthe-
;less they seemed to deserve all they got in comparison
with several faint-hearted potterers who were trying to
■“ play the game ” — i.e., the fair weather game—the only
.game they know how to play. I would call Rnight the
most utterly hopeless of these careful batsmen on a bad
■wicket. He scored three “ ducks ” and a 2 in four tries.
’The veteran Trumble was almost as tame as Rnight.
Hirst seemed incapable of wise strokes, and of the others
who did at least try to do something, little Rhodes
'Showed the most discretion in his hitting. I heard it
[remarked, about 1000 times, that none of the batting on
.these wet pitches was real cricket. The play was too
full of incident. The runs and disasters came too rapidly.
Real cricket is a slow compiling of long scores by both
• sides. Give me unreal cricket every time.
* * * *
For some time on the Monday afternoon and
Tuesday morning of the fifth test match, the wicket was
in the proper state of deadness to suit any fast bowler
who adopts the first principle of his business, and tries
.to hit the stumps with a straight-pitched one. Cotter,
and then Hirst, beat some of the batsmen by the mere
pace at which they rocked ’em in. It was a treat to see
the wicket shattered, or one stump sent flying out of the
ground. Cotter, for a while, bowled dangerously, and
men were caught off him through hitting at balls which
might have been left to bounce high over the wicket,
with a chance of going for 4 byes. Later, he was able to
keep the leather low, and Foster and Rnight were suc-
cessively knocked out in the old-fashioned way. The
quickness of the ball deceived the eye. YY'hen the Aus-
tralians came in, Hirst, with his second delivery, banged
Cotter’s stump out of the ground, and his first ball next
morning spoilt the great Trumper’s wicket. “Scientific
defence” has discovered no sure way of dealing with a
fast ball which, being pitched in front of the batsman’s
reach, catapults straight for his wicket. How is he to
“ place ” it accurately when he can’t strike it at all ? And
if pace can beat the bat on a dull wicket, what sort of
chance would science have against a new variety of
round-arm ball that skimmed the ground at “ lightning ”
speed? To see a few stumps shattered by fast, straight
balls is to conceive the possibility of a round-arm, or even
an under-arm, bowler who could get 10 for 0 on the
hardest pitch—the harder the better, if the artist had
the trick of putting in bailers at an express rate.

Clem Hill is 27 on March 18 and George
Giffen 43 on March 27. The latter has now been definitely
shunted from S.A. first-class cricket so far as Claxton and
Hill, his brother selectors, can manage the shunt.

Under-arm bowler Kinkade, playing for Pyr-

Sydney first-grade cricket grew a remarkable
crop of centuries on Saturday. There were five matches,
and four of them saw the hundred passed. Pite made
137 for Sydney against Paddington, and was still going
strong at stumps draw. Mackay slogged 149 for Burwood
against Redfern, before he was stumped by Baines off
Johnson. Farquhar had bashed 126 off University for
Central Cumberland when Mackay caught him off one
from Futter ; and Mackenzie had painted 109 on the
scoring-board for YVaverley against Leichhardt-Balmain,
when the end came through Carrick stumping him off
Sullivan. All this looks very well, and moves men to ask
why should Australian test teams have tails, but then
what would the scores have been had the batsmen faced
Hirst, Braund, Arnold and Bosanquet?

The tour of the Warner team in Australia will

The persistently aggressive bookie who stalks
on to private racecourses and bets, despite the club’s
prohibition, is making Maoriland beaks tired, and two of
him were lately gaoled for a month without the option,
at Christchurch. Other cases were listed to follow, when
counsel for defence suddenly rose and suggested that the
regulations against the fraternity were “ unreasonable,”
and it wouldn’t be a bad idea if the cases were adjourned,
in order that a decision might be obtained from the
Court of Appeal on the subject. This was eventually
agreed to, though the necessity for doing so wasn’t
apparent. The assertion that by-laws passed against
undesirable persons—illegal tote odds-layers, spielers,
and the riff-raff of the turf—are “unreasonable” is
amusing.

Sport Royal, after winning the Ballarat Cup
from a respectable field, with 9st. up, seems to have a
rough outside chance for Sydney Cup with Bst., including
the penalty. At the recent Y.R.C. Autumn meeting
visitors from YVestralia had a lot to say about Sport
Royal, and the horse was well liked bv the touts, although
he didn t appear to be quite himself. Hickenbotham has
evidently improved Sport Royal since he came back to his
native place from the West a few weeks ago. Given a
little more improvement, this stayer should pay expenses
at Randwick in one event or other. He may not be fast
enough for the Cup, but he’s a racehorse accustomed to
carrying big weights on the goldfields.

The latest horse-racing yarn cotnes from Colab
(Vic.). A local resident having dreamed Mairp for the
Newmarket, went to bed again with visionary intentions
and dreamed that he saw F.J.A. winning the All-Aged
Stakes and Emir winning the Champion. Backed the
three for himself, and advised his friends to follow his
spook tip. It is now proposed to turn the Colac seer into
a limited company and break the Ring on the strength of
his information.

The Sydney correspondent of the Australasian
remarked pleasantly—not to say sympathetically—of the
racing at the recent Warwick Farm meet: “ It is only to
be expected that byes will be run at this stage.” As long
as the “ respectable ” press continues to treat dishonest
running as a pardonable offence, it is only to be expected
that the Turf will get dirtier every year.
* « * *
The handy Mairp is a strong argument against
early racing for horses. As a 2-.vear-old in ’96 Mairp
never saw the post. He ran only three times in ’97 and
twice as a 4-year-old, since when he has run 80 races
winning the Newmarket in his tenth year.

Likely that Scottish King will not sport silk
again ; his break-down in the Champion Stakes was worse
than most people imagined. The suspensory ligament in
the off fore-leg gave way, and at the moment of writing

seeing that the continent is just now so poor in w.f.a.

First forfeits (Monday) for the big things of the
A.J.O.’s coming Autumn meeting thinned the Doncaster

Famous English amateur runner, Sid Thomas
(up to a few years back the best at his game the world
over, since YV. G. George), is coming Australiawards in
quest of matches at 3, 5 and 10 miles. Thomas fell from
prominence through becoming a professional and having
fewer opportunities for racing. Hard to think where he
can be accommodated unless Maorilander Huckstep,
Queensland Smith, or Victorian Lynas takes up the gage.
Thomas has covered 3m. in 14.24, 5 in 24.53 3-5, and 10 in
51.30, but that was over 10 years ago.

Mr. R. F. Pickering writes: “ Mr. Eyre
Pickering has been shooting pretty straight of late.
YVithin the last fortnight he has won the * Double Rise'
at Botany with eight kills out of ten, and tied with Mr.
R. A. Hill for the Garrett testimonial, with 30 kills each,
without a break, both on the 27J yards mark. Altogether
during the last two weeks, he has accounted for 90 birds
out of 95.” There’s a pretty record of wanton butchery 1
This alleged “ sport ” is a cruel, wicked business without
one solitary redeeming feature or streak of manliness
about it. The man who kills pigeons at 27J yards will be
of no more use as a rifleman in time of warthan the ancient
kitchen-maid who wrings the neck of the Sunday-dinner
fowl in a dark, evil-smelling back yard. If Mr. Pickering
even ate the pigeons he murdered there might be some
justification for the wanton slaughter, but no man eats
90 pigeons in one week. Pigeon-shooting is a form of
amusement which should be suppressed by law.

Ped. racing by night has “caught on” in
Queensland. Races, with prize money ranging from £l5
to £lOO, are now run regularly at Brisbane, Gympie,
Ipswich, Toowoomba, the Towers, and other places,
illuminants being electricity, “ Ritson light,” or gas.
Novice handicaps are included at some meetings, and the
local kid, with his pants rolled up, is now mostly engaged
in sprinting over the landscape, in order to get into

Maoriland is threatening to send J. Arnst,
winner of last year’s Dunlop YVarrnambool road race, to
France to uphold the tui feathers in the great Paris-
Bordeatix road contest. If the money required (esti-
mated at £500) can be found he will go. Premier Seddon,
who is an enthusiastic sport and once threatened to send
away footballers at State expense, will probably justify
Government assistance Qn the ground of advertising the

If cyclist Taylor isn’t careful there’ll be a big
slump in his repute for holiness before he gets away from
Australia, and rabbit-fronted parsons will cease to arise
and preach sermons on him as a black and brilliant
reproach to the YVhite Australia policy. Major holds a
unique position ; he is the best cyclist here, he is
under a contract which practically prevents his disquali-
fication, and to biff him out of the programme would
practically ruin the big Sydney meeting. So the alleged
holy one can do pretty much as he darned well pleases.
All of which is a double-barrelled reason why he should
be extra circumspect. Yet his riding in the “Peter-
sham ” scratch five mile event was most reprehensible.
He looked round three times while passing the members’
stand, he wobbled dangerously for the other people, he
was fined £5 for interfering with MacFarland so that Mac.
had to retire from the race, and after the contest he was
seen on the green wrangling with the long white rider in
a manner which indicates that, although the Lord took
special care over the preparation of Major’s legs, the
making of his manners was badly slummed.
♦ * * *
The best race of Wednesday night, the first of
the Sydney Thousand meeting, was the “ Petersham ”
Five Mile scratch event. Eighteen started, and after
doing a lap were sent off to a flying start. A terrific
tussle for the lap prizes made the pace hot till the last
few laps were reached. It was a picturesque event. The
lamps shed a green glare. The riders, in as many colors
as a crazy quilt, went by with a swish that sounded
like the rain on a roof. Three-quarters of a lap
from home M’Donald made a tremendous bound which
put even Taylor’s meteoric leap in the shade, but the
dark rider bent down and glided up alongside. Then the
great long figure of MacFarland whizzed through the
green light, and 15,000 people stood_up and yelled as the
white American shot past the dark one. Then there was
a clang, MacFarland swayed, and rode off into the grass,
and the rest of the bunch came past the stands with a
swish. On the outside a man in a red guernsey was
coming up like a bird, but seemed to be unable to pass
the darkie, and Taylor, with the sweat lying in layers
along his black face, turned his head round and glared at
him, and then bent down to drive his pedals with all his
soul. Downing, the second man, was ten paces behind,
and close to him, only a few inches away, Don Walker
was third.
* * * •
The Mosman one mile handicap saw some good
racing. Floyd MacFarland won his heat from scratch in
2min. 0.1-ssec. In the next heat F. A. Murphy, of Vic.,
who was on the 90 mark, covered the remaining 1670yds.
in lmin. 51.1-ssee. Major Taylor, far away on scratch,
without pacing assistance, never got a look in,
and failed to qualify. In the final, Walker, Farley,
and M’Donald paced MacFarland splendidly, and
the front men did the same for one another just
as energetically, and the result was a savage tussle.
The front men took Plunkett of Maoriland along at a
tremendous pace, but the YValker crowd brought Mae-
Farland up to them half a lap from home and left him to
his own efforts. He swept round the bunch, and
Plunkett came away with a bound. Then, while women
waved umbrellas and screamed with excitement and men
yelled like an asylum full of deranged “ bottle-ohs,
MacFarland rushed past the struggling Maorilander and
finished three lengths ahead in lmin. 49sec., a new world s
competition record.
Farley’s win of the “Balmain” Five Mile
scratch race Saturday night was one of the brightest
things lately seen on the S.C.G. track. The main bunch
Were mooning along, with Major Taylor somewhere about
the tail end, all grimly determined not to do any pacing,
and saving themselves for an almighty rush at the finish.
In the fifth lap Burton, Chalmers, Farley, and Payne
rushed to the front and broke away like motors.
Chalmers fell back immediately and disappeared into the
main bunch, which reckoned the three in front were only
going for the lap prizes. The three paced one another
alternately till Payne dropped out ; the other two
went on until they had gained three-quarters of a lap on
the field, and kept leading alternately. A mile from
home the field began to spurt in a vain effort to overtake
the runaways. Taylor led for a lap, and then others
made momentary spurts till Filsell, of Victoria, went to
the front; but it was too late. Farley and Burton were
fighting out the finish between them, 60 yards ahead, and
all the back bunch could do was to compete for the honor
of third place, which Taylor took with his usual jump.
It was a good race, but the time (lOmin. 52 2-ssec.) was
slow.

The League of Wheelmen officials were active
at Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday night. The
second heat of the YVoolloomooloo Handicap, an amateur
half-mile event, saw the whole 10 starters disqualified for
the rest of the meeting for collusion. This cheerful
thoroughness should have a salutary effect on riders.

When lightweight champion pug Bob Turner
and crack Sydney welter Blackmore, scaling 9.12 and
10.6 respectively, shaped at the Sydney National S.C.,
last week, the hall held a record crowd (possibly 2000),
jammed into every corner available, and completely
blocking up all exits. Hundreds were refused admission,
and most of these, including the usual hundreds more
who take up the same positions always when a big fight
is on, stood in the street, on the pathway, or sat on the
kerbstone, and patiently waited and watched for bulletins
until the struggle ended. Blackmore had expressed con-
fidence in his ability to win inside three or four rounds,
and betting people laid 2 to 1 on him. Directly the gong
sounded, Turner, full of faith in himself, forced things,
and, before the third round ended, offers to bet even
money he would win were plentiful, and later, odds up to
8 to 1 were available. The struggle was fast, vigorous
and sustained. Blackmore’s hooks were as much in
evidence as ever, but his most dangerous one, that
which has gained every fight for him—the left
for the jaw—found its way barred by a bony
fore-arm fend, rigid and upright, so that it pro-
tected the jaw capitally, and, no matter how hot the
situation or what position his body was in, Turner, cool
as an iceberg always, rarely shifted his crude but very
effective and well thought-out guard. Blackmore hooked
the ribs hard with right and left, often and heavily
enough to settle most ordinary men, but the blows had
no effect on Turner’s fighting ; he still came, and always
with the same amount of ginger. By-and-bye the light-
weight’s left side, from just below the armpit to the
waist, showed red as raw meat and bled in parts ; yet he
kept going, and operated so effectively that people
marvelled at his vitality. Time after time Blackmore
was completely baffled, especially when Turner met his
unusual clinging tactics by punching away with both
hands. Four times, perhaps, Turner slipped through
getting the spilled water in his corner on his shoes, but
he bounced up instanter and into the thick of it as fresh
as at the start, and the close of the 20th round saw him
declared a victor. Blackmore never looked a winner
once.

Lightweight champion bruiser, Bob Turner
(himself not yet 21 and a father), has five snowy-
headed younger brothers—all instinctive pugs. With
two small brothers of Australia’s champion welter, George
Johns, they give daily shows in a Pyrmont paddock with
the gloves that the late Otto Cribb' and Snowy Sturgeon
fought their second fight in, and charge the youth of.the
locality, who roll up in strong force, a ha’penny for
admission. The Turner family numbers eight boys
altogether—two older than Boh—and the whole lot, from
the smallest up, are fighters to the core.

Fight between heavyweights, colored Tas-
manian Mallee Jackson and Victorian Joe Cullen, at Her
Majesty’s, Kalgoorlie, t’other day, was an earnest bridse.
Cullen, tallow-hued and flabby, showed poorly compared
with the big colored man. This bulldoggy scrap, w ch
only lasted three rounds, provided more fight than -0
rounds of most championship battles. The punishment
and force, and the frequent stirring situations, were
remindful of the Choynski-Joe Goddard four rounds
slaughter at the old Sydney Gymnastic Club 14 years ago.
They mixed furiously without thought of evasion. .In
the second round a right on the jaw dropped Cullen like
a log, and he was down twice again, and stretched his
opponent out once before the three minutes ended. The
last was a hair-raising round ; they rolled into eich other
like demons gone mad. The finish came through Cullen,
dazed and done but spunky as a bull ant, hurling
himself at the enemy and, as he bore in, crossing the
right and dropping his man with a heavy thud. The fall
shook the last shred of strength out of the black and he
remained prone, while the winner was so badly rattled
that his knees sagged and trembled and he had to' be
guided to the dressing-room. It was the most vimful
fight ever seen in the West.

Rapidly-advancing Fort-street (Sydney) repre-
sentative, L. Murray, easily won Australasian schoolboy
swimming supremacy in i. 3 2-ssec. This is faster than
anything same lad had done before, and it is interesting
that in each of his last three 100yds. races he has im-
proved l-ssec. in a week. No schoolboy ever before
travelled so quickly a sprint trip.
“Nat.”: Display of diving at big swimming
carnival Saturday was remarkable—especially Wickham’s.
From a 30ft. high platform one of his headers was as
regular and well controlled as the flight of a huge bird.
Springing out he seemed to poise momentarily and, then
turning with legs rigid and the whole body well set,
struck the water at a beautiful angle with no more noise
or splash than the slash of a sword would occasion. It
was magnificent and could not possibly be excelled.'
Wickham, with such a performance, would easily win the
high diving championship of the world, but can he
repeat it ?

In sunlight and sea green they battled for the
half-mile championship of Australasia at Farmer’s Baths,
Rushcutter’s Bay, Sydney. Around the sides stood the
expectant crowd, and the glitter of bright costumes and
garish hats lit up the dark recesses. B. Reran, O. N.
Smith, R. Cavill struggled for N.S.W., W. L. Harris alone
upheld Victoria, while Queensland was represented by
D. Gailey and F. W. Springfield. They struck the water
in a line, and then the three N.S. Walers shot to the front
and swam abreast till Reran forged in front by yards and
behind him trailed Cavill, with Smith following. At
170.vds. the solitary Victorian dropped out, and the
Queenslanders were far in the rear. Cavill made spas-
modic spurts, but Reran cut through the water with a
clean, graceful motion. Cavill floundered, he seemed to
try to tear the water apart and kick himself into the
cavity, while the other went through it like a needle
through silk. His limbs worked with rhythmical
regularity, and at 600yds. he had left the champion
six yards to the bad. Cavill spurted, he struggled,
he tried his “ crawl ” stroke, but he lacked condition,
and ever the other streaked on, increasing the distance
between them till he touched the ropes ten yards in front
of the beaten champion. They shook hands in the water
and then climbed out, and Reran learned that he had
beaten Cavill’s world record by 20 3-ssec. having done the
distance in llmin. 29 4-ssec. Cavill lives in the water,
trains on peanuts and hop beer and only comes out of
the harbor to sleep. Reran, who works at the carpenter’s
bench on the Sobraon, swims twice per day and does the
half mile twice a week and has no peanuts or hop beer.
Judging by the result hop beer and peanuts have a
demoralising effect on champions. Sydney' was lucky on
Saturday ; it saw two world records beaten. The other
was the mile competition bicycle record which was
wrecked by MacFarland at Sydney Cricket Ground in
the evening.

“Plunge”: Have gone through Keran’s lap
(50yds.) time in his world record - breaking swim of
Saturday, and find that at 400yds. his 5.3 broke the
previous best (Englishman Jarvis’ 6.13 1-5), that at
500 yards his 6.23 3-5 beat Englishman Nuttall’s 6.24 1-5.
Reran did 600 yards in 7.45 (better than Jarvis’ 8.3), and
occupied 10.28 in covering 800 yards, while the prior
fastest was Jarvis’ 10.58 2-5.

Second Australasian Swimming Championship
carnival, at Newcastle, Monday' night, saw Cavill turn
the tables completely on Reran, who, though he displaced
“ Dick” at 60yds. and led by a yard at 90, lost his posi-
tion 60yds. further on, and, from a yard to the good
then, Cavill had an advantage of 4yds. (and more in
him) at the end. Reran was second, only a yard
in front of his “coach” (Bob Craig), and got out of the
water badly tired. Perhaps Reran is going stale, or did
Cavill’s high-tension pace in the early part break him up?
Time (2.31 1-5) is 1 2-ssec. faster than the previous Aus-
tralasian best (Cavill’s) accomplished last year, but
2 3-ssec. slower than the world’s record (Lane’s) made in
England two years ago.

After the last police raid upon gambling
schools at Broken Hill, and when heading ’em was
unhealthy for a time, the double-headed penny became
of no further special use, and gradually got into
circulation. Most coppers in Broken Hill sooner or later
pass through the local newspaper office, whose publisher
made a collection of the sinful coins. Within five months
he had gathered out of his cash 11 with either two heads
or two tails. It was good proof that the police hadn’t
got a move on any too soon.

Geelong was the rendezvous of the Yic. fire-
men’s holiday-making this year. Here, as usual, the
laurel was not always for the swift, nor the pewter trophy
for the strong. Notwithstanding stringent rules, the
brigade with brains and luck gets home in the various
gambols on the track. In the teams’ events, &c., wet
hose are used ; less time is lost through the Geelong
water —which, like the inhabitants of the Pivot, is on the
lingering side —percolating slowly through the hose.
But the brigade that has “pointers” with patience
enough to run a few bucketsfull of soft soap, or a few
bags of shot well-lubricated with graphite through the
hose a few times before starting afield, will gain more
seconds in the run down and the overflow than the com-
bined enthusiasm of all the firemen on the ground would
gain if not accompanied by these aids. Luck and
wrinkles bring joy, and shatter hopes all along the pro-
gramme. Disqualifications for such lapses as running
with a short hose (the cussedness of the average hose,
which shrinks feet at a time with no apparent cause, has
passed into a bve-word in red-coat circles), leaving the
couplings loose, &c., &c., are mere details in the lottery.
It is a lottery, and owing to the malignity of inanimate
objects, the first to the fireplugs are generally last, and
the last are first. Soon—next year, probably —the pic-
turesque red-coats will march ’neath the glare of the
torches no more, for the Fire Brigades Board has decided
the firemen’s dress uniform will henceforth be of blue,
and the crimson jackets are to be reserved for use at
fires.

Tell him how Australia prized it,
How its dearest blood baptized it;
Then the Silken Bonds draw tighter—
Tell him how our hopes are brighter ;
Mention how our crops are growing,
How our barns are overflowing ;
Twos and threes our flocks are bearing
(Be of calves and lambs unsparing)—
Proof all this, please say, of course is
Of our natural resources—
“ Marvellous recuperation ”
“Certainly the coming nation”

Don’t attack him violently);
“Land’s just flowing milk and honey,
But—it’s rather short of money."
(Broach it so, and deftly snare him—
We have done enough to scare him).
Tap him where his store of cash is,
Raise a trifle on the ashes ;
Help us, Warner, Ring of Cricket—
Ours the money, yours the ticket,
Do Australia this good turn :
Pawn the ashes and the urn.

N.S.W. Government has acted on one
recommendation of the Birth-rate Commission
very quickly, and by a proclamation declared
forfeit at the Customs all articles known to be used
solely for prevention. This is a power which a
State Government has, though the Customs Depart-
ment is administered by the Federal authority.
During the hearing in Rockhampton (Q.)
of the terrible M‘Donald case (in which M‘Donald
and wife were found guilty of the wilful murder,
by deliberate ill-usage and neglect, of M ‘Donald’s
daughter) it came to light that, previous to his
second marriage, the father had never in any way
maltreated or neglected his child. The step-
mother, while her step-daughter was dying, un-
cared-for, by inches, noticed one of her own
children unwell, and sent her off immediately to
Brisbane for medical treatment. No doctor came
near the other, although she was a mass of sores,
suffering from a broken wrist and fractured ribs,
and other injuries. The father announced his
child’s demise to the police thusly : “Sergeant,
God’s will be done ! My dear daughter is dead ! ”
Isn t there a Danish proverb that says: “The
child who gets a step-mother gets a step-father as
well.”

Extract from the speech of the Mayor of
Ballarat city, one Richard Pearse, at the feed
given by the Chinese Bo Reong Society to coun-
cillors and jaypees of the City of Statues: —
When the Chinese became Christianised and inter-
married with Britishers, the fear of war throughout
the world would be groundless, as they would be able to
defy the other nations. God made the Emperor just as
much as he made him (the mayor), and he asked them to
drink his health.
Our Imperial destiny— -a bastard Chow-British
race!
Mr. Deakin, when seeking a new com-
bination, should have turned his thoughts to that
great supporter of enterprising _ vigor, D.C.L.
Whisky, the incorporation of which beverage, in
properly regulated instalments, would impart more
strength and backbone to Ministerialists than any
other ally. As wisdom is the best guide to success,
so is D.C.L. the surest aid to wisdom. D.C.L.,
The Whusky of the Brainy.*
M'Millan’s place as deputy-leader of the
Dry Dog party in the Reps, will be filled by either
Dugald Thomson, of N.S.W., or Glynn, of South
Australia. Glynn was reckoned a Radical at one
time; nearly everybody who is something of a
sportsman (Glynn is a dashing rider after hounds)
can be reckoned a Radical. Certainly, he had
good land-tax views, too ; the name of him —
“Paddy”—probably had something to do with
that. It was partly the Paddy and partly the
land-tax views that turned the Assembly district
of Light against him two or three times. Glynn,
besides speaking with a most beautiful brogue,
rattles along at the rate of 200 words to the
minute, which made him absolutely unintelligible
to the little German farmers who swarm in that
district. All that they could make out was that
he was going to do something with their land,
and his enemies spread the idea that he was going
to take it from them, and down Glynn went every
time. But he’s P. M'Mahon Glynn, B. A., LL.B.,
now, and nobody suspects him of Radicalism in
these later days.
Premier Seddon got into a very perturbed
state of mind recently through a paper publishing
the fact that he and others had gone on a fishing
excursion in a Government steamer on the Saw-
bath. The Wellington Ministers’ Association
gathered up its shiny coat-tails and passed a
resolution a quarter of a column long condemning
the big man in its choicest style for scandalising
the community, and for using the people’s boat to
accomplish his vile design. Seddon defended
himself violently, and cast fish about in all direc-
tions, but there is no doubt that he has trodden
on a pretty large public corn in this matter.
Alec Marks, formerly Japanese Consul in
Melbourne, is now in America engineering a big
deal in brown meat for Bolivia, where the J ap coolie
isata premium. A. Marks is oneof the wealthiest
men in Australia. He and two brothers left
Melbourne about 45 years ago, just after the gold-
fever had subsided. They arrived in Japan with
a small capital and became the first wealthy
foreign firm in the Chrysanthemum Kingdom.
Their first great rise was made in buying up much
Japanese silver coin and shipping it to America.
The Japs, who were then in a barbarous condition,
knew nothing about using alloy in their coinage
and in their primitive way used to put more silver
in their yen than it was nominally worth. The
three brothers soon became merchant bankers,
each brother carrying on business in different
centres. They had their own vessels for trading
between the islands, and on one occasion, whilst
Alexander’s two brothers were on a voyage, a
squall struck their ship and they were drowned.
Alexander inherited all the property. After
making a fortune Mr. Marks returned to Mel-
bourne and married a daughter of Edward Cohen,
who was Commissioner of Customs in J. G.
Francis’ Ministry. His wife died and left him
two children, a daughter, who is married to a
Cohenor at Tam worth,, and a son who married a
daughter of the Chairman of Directors of the
Commercial Banking Company—another Cohenor.

S.A. Supreme Court had a delicate point
to decide recently A lady booked from Port
Adelaide to Fremantle by the Kanowna was
observed, when she got on board on December 19,
to be in a very “interesting” condition, and the
captain refused to take the risk of conveying her.
So she had to lose her passage and stay where she
was till her child was born (which, after all, was
not till February 5th) and then she claimed £99
damages from the A.U.S.N. Co. Verdict against
her, confirmed on appeal ; so that the term
“dangerous illness” stands as a definition of
pregnancy ; and the birth-rate may consider itself
at a discount.
/A backblocks’wife recently celebrated her
golden wedding in circumstances which showed a
genuine Mark Tapley spirit of cheerfulness under
difficulties. The husband was not present, but
the old lady took the head of the table and served
out the refreshments. A neighboring cocky pro-
posed the health of the couple, and the wife
responded, telling the company that the old man,
in his last letter, said he was well and happy, and
wished to be remembered to them all. The old
man was serving a sentence in Goulburn Gaol for
horse-stealing.

“F.C.” : The pestiferous small boy who
can never go a straight message is always causing
mischief. T’other afternoon a vision of loveli-
ness, in a green underskirt and lace frills, was
standing on the lowest step of Melbourne G.P.O.
awaiting someone. She tarried a while, and as
the minutes passed and the appointee didn’t pass,
the biting of her lip and the tapping of her foot
augured a gusty time for him when he did tran-
spire. A youngster happened along swinging
a billy. He belonged to. a neighboring
restaurant, and was going for the cook’s beer. In
returning, instead of using the level street, he
must needs go up and down the Post Office steps
to save the corner. As he descended, another
imp, hastening from the stamp-window, collided
with him, and the pair slithered down right
against the ankles of the waiting damsel. The
stamp boy picked himself up and “got” with-
out stopping to argue points ; but the beer
boy tried to rescue his billy, and in doing
so got under the lady, who sat on him,
weightily. The billy—well, there wasn’t any
billy; it was just a flat piece of tin ; and as much
of the beer as didn’t go down the boy’s neck ran
into the damsel’s shoes and soaked into her nice
green underskirt. The ribald onlookers shrieked,
whereupon the enraged lady took her parasol and,
still sitting on the youngster, lambasted him
enthusiastically for the space of two minutes.
Then he squeezed himself from under the mass of
angry woman and cleared with the ruins of his
billy, while his chastiser stepped on a tram and
rode home, dripping “booze” along the street.
It was a regrettable episode all round, especially
the loss of half a gallon of good liquor, and some
good young man —the one who should have
arrived but didn’t —will have a hard time over it.

Re Australian Cup. Of 42 races 9 only have
gone to N.S.W. reps. Latest winner (Marmont) is the
aged gelding which gained such distinction over the
jumps last autumn, when he appropriated five events
right off and subsequently annexed V.R.C. G.N. Hurdles,
afterwards the Doutta Galla Hurdles, and, later still,
Y.A.T.O. G.N. Hurdles. Present season saw Marmont
sporting silk a lot in flat races without doing much till
V.A.T.O. meet, few weeks back, when he squelched a
good field in Bond Cup (l£m.), but failed to draw weight,
and Proceedor got the coin. Marmont is by Wellington,
son of Panic, from Lady Gay, by Neckersgat from Fille
de Joie, by Gang Forward from Levity, the imported dam
of Don Juan, whose Melbourne Cup 31 years ago was a
sensational win by reason of the big pile of shekels the
nag’s owners (including whilom King of the Australian
ring, Joe Thompson) landed. Latter stages of this year’s
race were particularly fast. Final mile occupied only
1.42 i, and last 6fur. I.lo}.
• • • •
The more the racing authorities multiply by-
laws and regulations the greater are the facilities offered
for objecting to winners. The last M.L. Racing Confer-
ence ordained that only holders of jockeys’ or apprentices’
licenses should be allowed to ride in races. Whether this
rule was to supersede a previous one relating to ap-
prentices wasn’t stated, and this murkiness is making
trouble. The old rule reads that apprentices mustn’t
ride until they have been apprenticed one year, and then
only with the consent of their employers ; further, that
they can ride in any race, “ except as hereinbefore speci-
fied.” Whether the new rule includes the year limit and
the stipulation about employers and the “ hereinbefore
specified” and is merely an addition to the old one
neither man nor horse can tell. Amid this confusion the
owner of Convoy threw a bombshell at the racing com-
munity sometime after the Wellington Cup by objecting
to Gladsome, the winner of that race and also of the R.O.
Handicap, on the ground that jockey Jones was un-
licensed. As the mare has won quite a number of big
races this season with Jones in the saddle the point
almost amounts to an earthquake. If the owner of
Convoy proves his case the arrears of chaos will be
tremendous.
• • • •
The one time inconsequential Maoriland racer,
Bulawayo, who was tried at pony racing at the end of
December last, and within a week proved himself a Car-
bine among the miniature steeds, was saddled for
Dunedin Cup (sUosovs.), t’other day, and beat a field of
seven with ridiculous ease, putting up 2m. 36 2-ssec. for
the mile and a half, a record for the race. The N.Z. Cup
winner, Canteen, and the flying Gladsome (9st. 81b.)
figured among the starters. Bulawayo, who is a well-
bred nugget, had 6.13 up.
• * * *
This season has been remarkable for the Autumn
failures of small and early three-year-olds that were
“cracks” in the Spring. F.J.A., the little fellow who
ran brilliantly, and appeared to be fully up to w.f.a.
requirements, in the Toorak Handicap and V.R.C. Derby,
is shaping like a second-rater of late. Sweet Nell is now
hardly recognisable “on paper” as the filly who got away
with Caulfield Guineas and Cup. Lord Cardigan, the
Melbourne Cup winner, is a somewhat diminished hero.
Two big colts, Scottish King and Emir, have come on
whilst the others have gone back or stood still, but thus
far they don’t look likely to distinguish themselves in the
Sydney Cup under first-class test weights.
* * * *
Four horses remained in after final acceptances
of V.R.C. St. Leger. And the Age picked two as pro-
bable winners. When a sporting organ has to select half
the field to win a race, it is time it abandoned the effort
to tip winners and tried to tip a dray.
• * * •
Recent V.R.C. meeting was remarkable for the
success of Wallace blood. Seven races went to that
sire’s credit, and through a doubt as to whether he or
Bill of Portland is responsible for the existence of Mar-
tinique, the credit of that filly’s triumph is divided.
Grafton is a good second with 4 winners, then came
Malvolio and Wellington, 2 each. Results place Emir
top of the season’s 3-three-olds. Messrs. J. Wilson, jnr.,
and A. Wynne lead winning wners with two firsts each,
and the most fortunate of the riders was R. Lewis (3),
and W. H. Smith, J. Mason, and Barden (2 wins).
• • • *
Melbourne’s lately deceased sporting solicitor,
Mr. O. D. Halloran, was a mighty punter. Considering
that he was a V.R.C. committeeman for 22 years he ought
to have known better ; but General Report says that
during the last few years he lost to the bookmakers not
less than £40,000. Of course, in these matters the General
is known to be a thoroughly unreliable person with a
tendency to exaggeration. Under the name of C. Denis
the dead sportsman owned such pretty horseflesh as
Bohemian, Gladstone, Dowry, Eugene, Britomarte, and
others.

Australia is threatened with an invasion of
Rugby footballers from British Columbia. Judging by
our past showing against Maoriland, we won’t make a
decent breakfast for the Columbians on this side ; but a
match between them and the Maorilanders ought to be a
sight for the gods. The Columbians play amid the snow,
and there have been cases where the ball has cracked
and had hunks kicked out of it through being frozen
hard while the game was in progress. The average
British Columbian is about 6ft. 3in. high, broad in
proportion, and fitted with a kicking apparatus which
puts a mule to the blush. One of the most terrific
contests imaginable would be a match between the
Columbians and the Bailey family of Taranaki district
(Maoriland). The Baileys can put a fifteen of their own
in the field, and the baby of the crowd is sft. lljin. in
his socks, and has been known to pot a goal against the
wind from the half-way mark. To relate the heights and
doings of the rest of the family would be to bring the
veracity of The Bulletin into question.

S. A. Football Association, which last season
played on the Adelaide Oval “ for the last time,” has
just made good its threat by arranging all its programme
for the coming winter on outside grounds. “ Gate ” is,
of course, the trouble. Up to about 15 years ago, foot-
ball was not allowed on Adelaide Oval ground, as it was
supposed to damage the turf, and' inter state matches
were played on the now-neglected Kensington Oval (in
S.A. every recreation ground is an “oval,” in both name
and shape). The spread of the electorate system has
created good playing enclosures at Norwood, Port Ade-
aide and (Jnley ; the Exhibition Oval, though central,
is somewhat small for either cricket or football. Figures
of the dispute are as follows : Cricket Association gets,
as landlord, 20 per cent of the gross takings, and for the
new season asks 25 per cent. Footballers will give only
20 per cent, of the net receipts.

“ Australis” : The Melbourne street urchin has
evolved a new gamble, or rather a variation of an old one.
It is played enthusiastically and universally. Was
puzzled by the enormous demand of the small boy for
cigarette-cards (the card with a picture of a glaring
female on it enclosed in some packets of cigarettes) until
I saw 10 or 15 kiddies gambling with them in King-street.
The game is simplicity itself; all that is needed is a wall
and a supply of the cards. These are flipped with finger
and thumb up against the wall, the player kneeling on
the kerbstone while pitching. The one whose card falls
nearest to the wall gathers all cards and tosses them up
preferably in the teeth of the wind. All landing picture-
up he gets, whilst the others toss m order of proximity
for the remainder. The rules of pitch-and-toss govern
the game even to the “ barring ” of a bad “ spin.” It is
a sight to make the angels weep to see these boys, some-
times in groups of 20, gambling with feverish earnestness
while the language used surrounds them with a purple
haze. The game is gradually spreading to the State
schools and is rapidly placing a fictitious value on the
daubs which form the gambling medium. The day of the
wax-matchbox top, with which the writer gambled in
boyhood, seems gone for ever, its place being taken by
the more awkward and less easily procurable “ cigarette-
card.”

"Mots”: Have recently observed the genus
goffer” in his haunts. Many of him may be seen on
Sunday morning in Albert Park, Melbourne. They run
in all shapes and dimensions, but are mostly either of the
George Reid robustiousness of proportion or of the lath-
like flexibility of Lord Dick Nevill. The short, fat indi-
vidual generally wears check-patterned knickers, which
pan out about one check to the square foot; the tall and
narrow one wears stripes. The fat player stoops down,
obscuring a large portion of the horizon and nearly
bringing on a fit of apoplexy, places a small hall on a
heap of earth, makes several feints at it with a club, and
then hits one mighty stroke, and you hear the square
pattern on his knickers breaking up in all directions. If
the hit is a successful one the ball travels fully five to ten
yards, and the lath-like person (who usually wears eye-
glasses) drops down on his hands and knees, and with
nose close to earth inspects the spot to which it sped. If
the hit is unsuccessful the cows browsing close at hand
start off at a gallop, shocked by the awful language of the
man in the big checks. The players then solemnly pick
up their clubs, coats, camp-stools, sideboard, cruet-stand
and other furniture, and proceed to follow the ball with
the light of a tremendous purpose in their eyes, and the
cow with its tail standing up disappears over the horizon.

“Scrip”: Strayed into a sixpenny bar t’other
Saturday afternoon to analyse the contents of a bottle
with a new label, and discovered some working men
arguing about Cornishmen and fight. (The Maoriland
wurkin’ mahn always monopolises the toff bar on pay
days, and spends the money he has kept from his old
woman like a prince.) “ Cornishmen are no d good,”
said an excitable little man with a face like a paralysed
jam jar.” “ What ’bout Bob Fitzsimmons, the fighter ? ”
asked a chap in a big collar which resembled a white boa-
constrictor coiled round a hospital. “He’s the excep-
tion," said the little cove as he planked his flagon on the
bar. “ I know him ; I taught him how to fight, and how
to find the heart in three tries.” The crowd grew
interested. “ I showed him new punches, so I did ;
but, as I was saying, I know St. Stephen’s Church in
Glasgow, I’ve been in Warsaw' and Trinidad, and I hit an
American once for sneezing on the British flag, but
Cornishmen are no d good.” Someone here expostu-
lated, but was urged to silence. “ But I know a fightei
who is going to ring the bell on the world. He is neither
English, Irish, nor Scotch (Cornishmen are no d good),
and he can hit a 3501 b. punch, so he can. I’m teaching
him. He’s a buck nigger, with a heart as big as a sheep
station, and he’ll plane chips off any man living, including
Cornishman Bob Fitzsimmons, but, as I said before,
Cornishmen are no d .” He said no more, as a plunk
on the nose sent him down, and he had to be
carried out. “Did that chap really teach Fitzsimmons
here?” I asked one of the party. “Never saw him in his
life ” was the reply.

“ Glonoin ” : Why doesn’t one of the Sydney
boxing clubs get up a heavyweight novice tourney for
coal-heavers and such ? If the big men were encouraged
we might possibly produce a world’s champion again.
More than likely that, within next day or two,
turbanned champion ’rastler of Australia, Buttan Singh,
will be matched, with M.L. top-rung performer, R. J.
Scott, for £lOO aside. Scott wants the struggle at Grey-
mouth (M.L.), St. Patrick’s Day, but it’s hardly likely the
Hindu will agree ; there’s not enough time to get ready.
Seott will find the alien a tough customer—he is strong
as a Pagel and lissom almost as a contortionist.
* * * •
Is two-up fascinating? It attracts Sydney
people so much that they play it all night. There’s a
coffee-stall, with some spare space at the back, and a hole
in the wall for known customers, with right of ingress at
all hours. And in Melbourne, on the Yarra, just below
the end of Rensington-road, a narrow-necked peninsula
gives standing-room to a crowd of 40 to 60 men each
Sunday. They are guarded by four sentinels—one on the
neck of the land and three river-wards.
“D-Population.”
“Filius Crucis, ” who wrote recently on the
subject of “ Depopulation,” writes this time under
a new heading:—
. Which, if not much of an improvement on “ Depopula-
tion,” the title to which you demurred, seems however to
be the idea of most of the countries that have abjured
Rome, for they nearly all rank below their rivals in
birth-rates and proliiicness. The great exception,
Germany, is as regards two-thirds of it, Catholic, and it
is in its latter description of Empire that we find the
most notable increases. I ruefully enough admit that
vou make a strong point when you furnish figures to show
that in death-rates the scapular, etc.-believing-innations
are as inferior as in the two items animadverted on they
are superior, but I think you hardly show your usual
justice when, to swell this hygienic particular, you put
in your list of Protestant and Catholic peoples
Maoriland and Australia, for. with their mere
suggestions of populations, and large areas, they
must necessarily show better as foes to the gentle-
man with the scythe than places like Belgium,
Portugal, and Italy. These latter and their congeners
also have large poverty-stricken populations, so that
mortality must work fearful havoc with them They,
however, all show a marked improvement in life condi-
tions, so, in a comparatively short time, their slaughters
of innocents will be less noticeable, while advents of
fresh cherubs will as surely increase, too. Fervently
Catholic Ireland, it may be noted, has nearly 700 cen-
tenarians in it; England, with nine times its population,
but about 300! In your list of 17 countries the Pro-
testant total seems to be unfairly increased b.v Germany
appearing twice (as Protestant); once it is as Prussia
(births per 100,000, 3612); then it is Germany (births per
100,000, 3596). A duplication of this Empire into Pro-
testant and Catholic segments would give the real thing
all right. For a final word I positively must say I think
your contention that Greek Church countries ought not
to be counted as Catholic ones is a weak one ; the respec-
tive cults are as similar really as Salvarmism is to Con-
venticlism, a doctor to a surgeon, or a paper contributor
to an ass. ' '
To which The Bulletin - replies briefly that
“ Filius Crucis ” is mixing things up. In
showing the birth-rate of Protestant and R.C.
countries, The Bulletin put down Germany
(apart from Prussia) as mostly Protestant, and
with 11 Protestants to six Catholics it is so.
“Filius Crucis” would do much better if he
complained of Switzerland, which has a very bad
birth-rate, being classed with Protestant States,
seeing that it lias a much larger R.C. per-
centage than Germany. As for the attempt
to prove that Catholic countries have a
better birth-rate than Protestant ones by
including Russia, and claiming that the
Greek Church is really R.C., this is rather thin.
The Popes have hurled the brick of excom-
munication too violently at the Greek
Church for that theory to pass muster. At all
events, if the Russians are Roman Catholics, it
would be safer to break the news to them by tele-
phone or anonymous post-card. Russia isn’t
in a good temper just now.

“Straggler”: Re Maoriland Health Depart-
ment (“A Woman’s Letter,” B. 11/2/'o4)—if
Ward s address to the Science Congress claimed
any superiority for M.L. methods of food inspec-
tion, he was a bit audacious. M.L. has no syste-
tematic supervision of food supply at all. It
probably has the statutes and the machinery, but, if
so, they work only in spurts and patches. Meat
and butter are in some degree under inspection ;
for two or three of the larger cities exercise fair
control over the slaughtering and sale of meat,
and butter factories are liable to odd visits from
Government inspectors. But the great bulk of
both those products passes from producer to con-
sumer without any supervision at all. The same
may be said of fish, fruit, and bread. The open
shop-front of the butcher, the greengrocer, and the
fishmonger, still offer hospitality to the fugitive
microbe, and uncovered dust-carts help it on its
way. Provisions of various kinds are still exposed
on the sidewalks. The dairyman of Maoriland is
probably somewhat more sanitary than he used to
be, but the tuberculous cow may still contaminate
the whole output of a factory, and the farmer’s
consumptive family may still handle and distribute
milk and butter.

“ John Gilpin” discourseth about the declining
birth-rate:
Tiie 15u;,1k tin’s idea of instilling into the average
Australian his duty to the nation as regards population,
by waking in his soul a patriotic or national sentiment,
etc., reads real funny to one. of the common herd. I lent
your ariicle on the above to a woman of ordinary in-
telligence to read, and when I asked her what she
thaught about it I only got for reply a very tired smile.
To make a man a patriot, you must first make him love
his country, and to make a man love his country you
must make the said country lovable. Now Australia at
present is not at all lovable, from my point of view. I
suppose I may consider myself as belonging to the
“common people” who are supposed to trot out the
future generations. Hence my views.
To beget children it is almost necessary to be married
—one ought to be at any rate ; but the present
state of Australia morally forbids such a luxury to
the average toiler, for the simple reason that his earnings
are insufficient to comfortably maintain a wife. (Note
the word comfortably. The average Australian likes to
be comfortable ; indeed comfort and patriotism mostly
go together.) Hence the declining marriage and birth-
rate. Every man would like to be a father, and every
woman a mother, but in the present state of affairs I am
“ not taking any.” Why should I? Am I not pushed
enough as it is to eke out an existence? I consider it
would be criminal for a man in my position (and there
are thousands in the same boat) to attempt to rear
children, and it is a stubborn fact that there are thou-
sands of men and women, married and unmarried, who
look at the question in this light. It is a practicable view
and a sensible one also. As long as Australia is governed
in the interests of the money-lender and Rebecca Bull
and Co., the Australian birth-rate won’t go up worth a
cent, but will decrease from purely natural and other
causes, which will be a sad thing for Australia. This
country may yet want all the Australians it can get.
Tb- re is only one remedy. Australia must wake up
and commence to be Australian. It must find employ-
ment for its people, not by cutting prickly-pear or clea'r-
ing seruh lands, but by a thumping protective tariff,
thereby promoting industries such as iron and steel
works, cotton mills, and others too numerous to mention.
The great drawback in this country is the difficulty in
obtaining constant employment. The man out of work
finds it hard to get in, while the man who is in finds it
mighty hard to stop in. Overcome this state of affairs
and Australia will become full of national sentiment of
the right sort; and the birth-rate will go up in such a
way as to “ stagger humanity.”
Give us employment, constant employment ; and I for
one will marry, become a patriot, and attempt to remedy
the failing birth-rate. Also, Australia must not lose sight
of the facts that there is not a food-stuff used on the face
of the earth that can’t be grown here, and that almost
every metal is found in some part or other of this terri-
tory. The raw material is here ; the labor is here.
Utilise these, and there will then be no need to appoint
commissions whose report, in nine cases out of ten, does
not go within coo-ee of the root of the evil.

The natives of some of the Pacific Islands
are very superstitious in connection with their
dead, and resemble the Maoris in this respect.
When a small schooner, named after a defunct
chief, was wrecked at Atiu a while back, the
natives got the cargo ashore and then demolished
what remained of the vessel by fire. Even the
anchor, chains, etc., weren’t retained, but were
taken out and sunk in deep water. Idea was that
as the chief was dead his boat was dead also, and
if they divided' the salvage the spirit of the
departed would curse them for ever, and they’d
be struck by lightning, or all their teeth would
drop out, or something.

It is said that Bewick, Moreing and Co. are to
retire from the management of the Lake View Consols
and Great Boulder Main Beef (W.A.), in the belief that
these mines prospects are practically nil. It was recently
stated in London that the Main Beef’s reserves were nearly
depleted, and that what ore remained was unpayable.
This was promptly denied, but the fact remains that, in
1902, the co. worked at a loss of 2s. a ton, and it is a cer-
tainty that last year’s results were still worse. The Lake
View must be looking very hopeless if 8., M. and Co.
voluntarily resign from the management. The weakness
in the scrip may be ascribed to their secession.
* * * *
It is current report that most of the bosses of the
Great Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) are to be fired out.
Inis is said to be on account of the management having
handed over to the Lake View Consols their tailings for
filling in the stopes, whereupon the Consols people re-
them, and, it is alleged, found they were worth
lzdwt. per ton. If the rumor is true it would be hard on
u y -V n iu ene . r £ e tic shift boss, who kept the mine going
while the nominal boss was seeing the world—supposing
rL nn were included. Anyway, it would be absurd to sack
an underground. boss, who merely superintends the
mining, for a mistake possibly made in another depart-
ment. Bumor has it that Fred. Morgan, one of the
numerous brothers who help to run the Golden Mile, is
to run the show. It is also said that Frank Gardner has
lost control of the mine.
* * • *
B° u^er (W.A.) main shaft is now down
to 1100 ft., and exploring from this level will shortly be
started. The crosscuts at 900 ft. are still proceeding, but
nothing of any value has so far been encountered.
Except as a gambling counter, the scrip is valueless, as
here often stated. The lode worked in the early days
underlaid west into the Associated, and no lode of any
value has been discovered on the eastern side of the
property. The Brown Hill, Brown Hill Extended, and
the Oroya East have spent thousands trying to locate
an eastern lode, but all, so far, without any result. The
country is, apparently, outside the gold belt, and is
never likely to be any good. The co. was last recon-
structed in June, ’O2, with a 2s. 6d. assessment, and there
is still an outstanding liability on the scrip, which may
be called up at any time. There are 85,000 reserve
shares, but they are about worthless, as they can hardly
discount Whi ' e the 80rip is c l uoted afc 80 per cent.
* * * *
.fe“ M » r S aret > -Bulong (W.A.), made a profit
of £3lBB during the last half-year, most, if not all, of
which came from the levy on tributors. The co.’s new
acquisition, the South Gippsland, at Vosperton, has
proved a frost, and is now being worked at a loss. If
things don t improve there, the manager, Joseph Davies,
threatens to abandon the show. This property was
acquired by the co. after it had been tested with a
r m ,', n S r , od > and the chairman’s faith in divining rods
should get a nasty knock in consequence.
■ ™ mors are afloat regarding the Asso-
ciated (W.A.) One is that the property is to fall into
the hands of Bewick, Moreing & Co., and that Gleisbergis
to he replaced by Bigelow, now in charge of Lake View
Consols. There is still no definite news of the Oroya
chute bub, apparently, Bewick, Moreing & Co. are quite
satisfied of its existence in the Associated, or they
wouldn tbe so eager to capture control. The recent fall
m the scrip may have been engineered by people who
want to get in cheap, but it is more probable that the
fall in international stocks has forced Continental holders
(who are predominant) to realise.
* * * *
The reason of all the rumors regarding changes
of management in the Associated, Associated Northern,
and Northern Blocks Syndicate (Kaigoorlie) are now
apparent. The offices of all three concerns have been
transferred to 20 Copthall Avenue, the abode of Bewick,
loreing, and Co. As B.M. and Co. rarely, if ever, retain
old officials it is pretty certain that both Gleisberg and
Bobei ts will be relieved before long, and new importa-
tions take their place. The next big grab may be the
Perseverance including probably the Boulder Deep Levels
ana South Kaigurli, which are at present under the same
management.
* * * *
Iyanh° e Junction (W.A.) is putting through a
310-ton ciushing. As is not uncommon with Adelaide
companies, the announcement is immediately followed
by a call of 6d. per share. This, in itself, is enough to
make one sniff at the show. The call comes as a surprise,
as the last call was made only about a month ago. Aus-
tralian shareholders appear to be even more long-suffering l
tha,n their brethren in the Great Smoke when they allow
calls to he made on the eve of what they allege is to be a
payable crushing. Manager Johnson may be a good
miner but results, not reports, are what' shareholders
should insist on ; and, so far, the results have been nil,
and it won t be at all surprising if the present return is
very poor. This Ivanhoe Junction has been running
for years, and shareholders will get a pleasant surprise if
the show now turns up trumps.
Victory United, Cuddingwara (W.A.), has an-
nounced its second crushing as 45 tons for 41oz. 9dwt.
Ihe Murchison press is very sarcastic over the result-
quotes all the optimistic reports issued on the property
and suggests that a meeting of local shareholders be held
to investigate. Anyone who knows the wavs of Adelaide
management will not, or should not, be surprised at the
result. Nearly every Adelaide-controlled company has
issued scores of dubious reports.
* * * »
Great Fin gall, Day Dawn (W.A.), appears to
have got into a poor zone at No. 10 level. Both drives
north and south, have been extended about 200 ft., and
the grade of ore is much below the average. The
north averages lldwt. except for the last 20ft., where
1* , has declined to sdwt. The south drive averages
f ° r the first 100 ft., and only 6Jdwt. for the second
100 ft. So far, the pay chute at this level is thus
less than 300 ft. long, and the grade of ore much
under the usual 25dwt. average so far treated,
ihe first extra 20-head of stamps, which were
expected to start by the middle of February, only
commence work about the middle of March. The further
exploitation of No. 10 level will be watched with interest
if not with anxiety.

During February, Ravenswood (N.Q.) treated
2323 tons for 40050 z., the best since last August The
largest contributor was the Sunset, the boss mina’of the
New Bavenswood, Limited, about the only English co
that has won a div. on the field. An additional 4441
shares have been issued to the shareholders at £5
bringing the capital up to £40,000. It is proposed now
to split these into 200,000 shares of 4s. each. Last year
the company paid 15s. in divs. (75 per cent, on the £1
share) ; but as sales are supposed to have been made at
£lO, those that bought at that price realised only 71 per
cent., which isn’t the same thing. The multiplication of
scrip is obviously to help the market. Although not
registered on Q. ’Changes, shares were quoted once.
Secretary Kift, from London, and general manager
Wilson offered first £lO and then £lO 2s. od. ; but no one
in the room had any to sell—although a lot wished they
had at the price. The property embraces the Sunset,

reefs ; but the backbone is the Sunset, which averages
with concentrates, about 35dvvt., and the sands “are
valued at lOdwt. They raise about 1300 tons a month
The Grant crushes about 30dwt.; but it seems from the
returns that they only have annual crushings of about
250 tons. The whole field is suffering from a big boom
and a bad burst. Grant and Sunset Extended, which
was expected to “ bottom on the Sunset footwall lode in
500 ft. ” {vide prospectus), stopped at 920 ft., and is now
opening out on a reef cut at 505 ft. When it was cut it
was merely a leader “showing the proximity of the main
lode,” but as nothing better was got below, its import-
ance has been enhanced considerably by selling brokers.
The Bavenswood reefs are of high average value, but
their existence at a depth and the persistency of the
chutes have yet to be proved.

Tributors at the once famous Burra copper
mine (S.A.), which the co. deserted 30 years ago, have
got into an ore branch from which good returns are
coining, What became of the Burra ore deposit has
always been a mystery. Officially the co. went on the
assumption that it was a big surface deposit, while old
hands hold that it was fed by fissure lodes which ought
to be found. The melancholy mine and town have been
repeatedly threatened with revivals, so S. Australia has
long since left off taking much interest in these announce-
ments ; but the fact that ore is actually being produced
marks this “revival ” as something out of the ordinary,

The unlucky Anglo-Australian Exploration Co.,
formed in 1894 and reconstructed in 1897, since when it
had paid no div. up to the end of 1903, broke the mono-
tony then with one of Is. 6d , which left it with only £3OB
to carry forward. And it might have been better if it
had not been able to pay that div., seeing that it was
mostly profit made out of the sale of 11,670 shares in Mt.
Boppy, which is now on the up-grade, wherefore the
A.A.E. Co. is probably sorry it sold. Still, according to
London reports, the Anglo-Australian did not go out of
Mt. Boppy to the extent that was supposed, and still
holds 38,174 shares. The cash (apart from profit) got out
of the sale has been put into an Indian venture.

The Atlas feat of supporting Yulcana on one upraised

A silly little Melbourne publication is responsible for
the statement that Florence Young has developed “con-

The passing round of the hat to allow some song-bird
to keep its beak supplied with seed has become a mono-
tonous ceremony in Australia lately. A refreshing break
away has been made by Miss Maggie Farrell, of Stawell
(Vic.). She has a voice, and her friends took up a collec-
tion. Now the money is to be divided among charities,
as she has decided not to pursue her studies—she gets
married instead. <
There’s a movement on foot to send another singer

raw.

“ P-C-” : The intention of Pope Pius X. to reform the
music sung by R.C. choirs is not a new idea at all. As
far back as 1564 another Pope Pius—the Fourth—formed
a sort of Commission of Cardinals to inquire into a
similar trouble and stamp out the abuses that had crept
into the musical services of the Church. Some musical
cranks of those early days composed Church services of
canons, rounds, and the like, which were simply Chinese
puzzles m a musical way ; others would take a popular
air and use it as the foundation for a whole Mass, and
there is a Mass of that time still extant in which the
s^ou * s “Alleluia, Alleluia,” and nothing but
Al'elllia” from the first bar to the last. The result of
the labors of Pius was a Mass composed by Palestrina
which is considered a model of its kind even at the pre-
sent day. r
Theodore Kremer, who, according to. London Daily

_ r !‘? jeon Brodsky ” : A letter just received from Mr.
William Archer, to whom I wrote for advice concerning
an Australian National Theatre, suggests that the best
way to start is with municipal theatres in Melbourne and
Sydney. He thinks the cash difficulty the least of all
A manager, actors, repertory, and traditions will all be
very hard to obtain.” The repertory will certainly offer
its problems for solution, but it and the traditions can
stand over. The absence of a past in Australia certainly
militates somewhat against the creation of an artistic at-
mosphere (who was it said that there was nothing 1 as unin-
terestmg as the woman and the country without a past?)
but then we shall have the chance of avoiding much
error which is encrusted in a lot of European tradition.
Of the four difficulties mentioned by Mr. Archer, the one
that seems the greatest to me is that of the actors. I
doubt if at the present moment we were to get a theatre
for purely art purposes, whether we could get together a
good enough company. At present the plays produced
m Australia mean nothing, and consequently an actor’s
success is conditioned by his personality, his looks or
something else that does not count as art. The sooner
therefore, we can get a new school of young men and
women, with a broad general knowledge and some real
enthusiasm for art, to train for the stage, and to train
only in good plays, the better. Valuable work can be
done m this connection by amateur clubs;
More than half the country members of
N.S.W. Assembly more or less learned their fate
on Tuesday morning. The new electorate boun-
danes are not absolutely fixed, objectors being
offered 14 days in which to convince the Commis-
sioners that some other plan of distribution
would be better; but serious changes are not
likely. The Newcastle and Maitland group will
lose three members. Some of the old electorates
are carved up among three new ones. Thus
on?, ,P art of Waratah is tacked on to
Wickham, another part on to portions of
East Maitland and Wallsend, and a third
on to Kahibah. Newcastle West is cut
U P the same W; W- Wickham, Kahibah,
and Newcastle East remain intact, with frag-
ments added to them. If the man whose old
electorate is left in this way has any “pull ” this
arrangement will be good for Fegan (Wickham),
Edden (Kahibah), and Dick (Newcastle E.). Either
“Pa” Brunker (East Maitland) or Gillies (West
Maitland) will, it seems, have to be crowded out.
Outside that district Grafton (Premier JSee’s dis-
trict), Armidale, Glen Innes, Tenterfield, and
Ballina are left whole; while Lismore, Tweed
Richmond, Raleigh, Inverell and Uralla Walcha
are sliced up. In the Far West there is slaughter.
Broken Hill loses one member ; Cann’s district is
left; but Ferguson and Williams will have to
fight for a combined Alma and Sturt. Wilcannia,
Condoblin, Cobar, Barwon and Bourke are thrown
mostly into two electorates, with Bourke and
Cobar as centres ; and it takes most of Went-
worth, Hay and The Lachlan to make up another.
These Far West districts now return Cann
Ferguson, Williams, Scobie, Clara, Willis, Davisi
Macdonnel, Byrne, Carroll and Sleath—ll of
them, and six of them must die. In this case, if
the man whose old district is left intact has the
“pull,” the advantage lies with Cann, Scobie,
Macdonnel and Davis.
Resch’s Waver ley Brewery held its annual
picnic the other day, at Correy’s Gardens, Caharita. Mr.

portionately as the big brewery, but doubtless he wished

“ Hist ” sends along a legend
Re references to the effect of Vic. Black Wednesday on
Governor Bowen. He was the most astounded man in
Australia when he discovered the tremendous shock to
the public mind on the publication of the Gazette sack-
ing the civil service. His Ex. had been easily got round
by a promise of an additional vote for furniture, and was
so delighted with the windfall of tables and chairs that
he never gave his signature to the fateful proclamation a
second thought. A year afterwards, when feeling had
cooled down a bit, he threw his arms round the neck of
Gowen Evans, one of the Argus bosses, and begged to be
forgiven. Gowen smole a sickly smile, but said nuffin.
On leaving for England, Bowen made the tearful remark
that he had forfeited the good opinion of the only people
in the State whose respect he valued.
Seems to have been a very weepy Excellency, if
this yarn is based on fact.

“Vulcan”: In noticing Sir Montagu
Gerard’s book, “Diaries of a Soldier and Sports-
man,” London Times gives two extracts, which
show why Britain may look for the loyal support
of “our brown brother” when time of need
comes:
A subaltern gets into a railway carriage, where, to his
disgust, he finds a couple of Hindu gentlemen. He
quietly waits till the train is in motion, and then, as he
expresses it, “ fires them out of the door."
On another occasion, a petty rajah, going on a state
visit to Agra, takes his seat in a first-class compartment,
and is given a great “ send-off” by his subjects. On his
return the said subjects make for the first-class carriage
for him, but find him timidly crawling from a third-class
compartment, when he explains to the waiting crowd
that, on his way down, he was boxed up with a couple of
sahibs, all muddy from snipe-shooting, who made him
shampoo them the whole journey.
The hook is full of similar instances of how the
gentle sahib is encouraging our beloved fellow-
subject to stand by the Empire.

A muffled curse from Bunbury (W.A.) :—
John Forrest is looked upon with reverence by a great
many old Westralian settlers, particularly by those of his
native town, Bunbury, which, some time hereafter, will
no doubt appear in the school geography books as chiefly
noted for being Bigjohn’s birthplace. Some t’othersiders
were visiting Bunbury on one occasion, and soon became
tired of hearing about nothing but the deeds and misdeeds
of the burly knight. “That’s a nice allotment over
there,’’quoth one visitor. “Nice allotment! I should
think it is a nice allotment,” came the reply of the Bun-
burvite. “Why, I’ve played cricket with John Forrest
on the very spot. See the old fence there. I mind
chasing John Forrest—Jack Forrest, we used to call him
then—over that fence. I suppose he lepped four feet if
he lepped an inch.” Said one of the visitors, with bitter
sarcasm : “ I heard it said that once, when John Forrest
was a boy, his hat blew off in this town. I should like to
see the spot.” The old identity considered the matter
seriously : “ I disremember that, but I daresay it was the
time when I chased him. At any rate, 1 know he bust
his pants.”
“A.L.M.H.”: Can anyone tell me the
origin of the expression “ Miserable as a bandi-
coot ? ” I can follow the line of reasoning which
dubs a spiteful female a cat, and can also dimly
comprehend the qualities involved when one
gentleman calls another a cow, but the reason of
the bandicoot being a synonym for misery still
escapes me. He is a more than ordinarily light-
hearted little beast, and prances about at night
with a cheerfulness which at some seasons approxi-
mates almost to giddiness. He enjoys his existence
as much as most of us, and even if his habitation
is a hollow log, or, at most, a shallow burrow, he
is far from being depressed about it.
Dear Bulletin. —Strolling down the prin-
cipal street in , the other night, I happened
upon a ludicrous affair. A stout dwarf of a woman,
whose loose, fat face was the color of a tomato,
was severely belaboring a Chow. She had him
strung by his pigtail around a lamp post, and was
bashing him with the remains of a jew-fish ! After
she had belted him until you couldn’t discern
which was Chow and which was fish, the Wrathy
Wraith released him with a “Come on now, yer
old Chinkie ! ” Tne Chow smiled vaguely and
departed arm-in-arm with her. Then I noticed
that she had a wooden leg. A by-stander told me
thislittle romance: One night she came to the Chow’s
shop and demanded a long beer. He shoved her out,
but she refused to go. At last he weighed out 3d.
worth of pea-nuts and offered them. She was
grateful and came to live with him. But the
yarn spread, and every gutter-snipe jeered at
John and told him to go and get legally married.
John couldn’t stand the popular contumely, and
did so. On this particular night they had done the
Block, and someone had asked him how was
“ his illicit spouse with the wooden leg getting
on.” John turned indignantly. “Memallied—
plopperly mally—Plespertelian Churchee. Blully
P lallakin ! ” Then his wife told him to shut
up and come along, but he disobeyed and turned
and said “Blully lallakin” again. Whereupon
she hit him with the fish.—“X.”

Mr. PETE HUGHES.
. Known far and wide in theatrical
circles, Mr. Pete Hughes, who for
years acted as advance for Mr.
J. 0. Williamson, the famous entre-
preneur, suffered from Weak Kidneys
and Lame Back. He consulted the
Specialists of The Freeman & Wallace
Institute, became cured, and de-
clares :
“ Your Electro-Medical Treatment

from which I suffered for many
years. Your Electric ‘ lnvigorator ’

I ever anticipated. ”

Mr. Q. H. BERNARD was a sufferer,
and—to quote his words—“ a physical
wreck”—in 1902. Yet here is an
extract from his letters sent after a
few weeks’ treatment :
“ Ganmain Station, via Wagga.
“ 1 am, getting on steadily and surely.
My nerves are in a much better state
now. 1 am not now subject to those
severe frontal headaches. My brain is
quite capable of executing any reason-
able amount of labor offered it."
Mr. 0. D. HAILEY.
From Toorak, Victoria, Mr. C. D.
HAILEY chronicles his improvement
from chronic dyspepsia, from which he
was a great sufferer. In his reply to our
queries concerning his health, he
states:
“1 am netting on first-class. 1 have
n»t had better health for many years.
The medicine you sent me was the very
thing in every respect. I feel certain
that 1 will continue to improve, and
ultimately regain my usual health."

SICNOR CARLO DANI, the dis-
tinguished operatic tenor of the Ro.va
Italian Opera Company, Sydney, says
of the Electric “ Invigorator ” which
he wore:
“ I desire to inform you that, owing

changes, I tried your treatment , from
which I have obtained great benefit to
my muscular and nerve systems."

“Flabby Paul”: Our assistant-surveyor
is an advocate of White Australia, and when the
boss told him to go and survey a Chinaman’s farm
he was annoyed I and another were in his
party, and so we proceeded to the farm. Arriving
there, about half-a dozen hungry-looking dogs
rushed at us. Wo scared them off, and the a.-s.
gave one a kick that landed the dog five
yards away. This seemed to relieve his feelings
a little. A Chow came out when he heard the
row and said, “Hulloa, you messer?” The a.-s.
glared, and words failed him for 36i seconds.
Then his 25 years of experience in the Australian
language came into play. “You slant-eyed
yeliow son of a Boxer—you call me that again and
I’ll break your jaw ! ” “ Whaffor you swear like
that—you messer ? ” The a.-s. nearly took a fit.
Placing his theodolite on the ground, he spat on
his hands. The Chow retreated. “ Whaffor, me
no savee—you messer ?” The a.-s. rushed, and
the Chow did “even time” to his hut. We
followed to see the fun, and found the Chow at
bay, with an axe in his hand, the a.-s. dancing
round him. “Come out of that, you useless,
leprous streak of misery. Call me bad names,
would you ! I’ll drag yo.’.r miserable hide-bound
carcase round the hemisphere !” “Whaffor you
fightee me—me no talk longa you—me asken you
—you messer ; messer land for me.” Then the
a.-s. saw his mistake, and calmed down. He was
so much depressed thac he even spoke kindly to
the dog.

A tired fragment of irregular mental
habits—one Charles Anderson—lately set the
Victorian law a considerable problem in social
economics. 0. Anderson certainly didn’t intend
to do anything so harsh ; he was just a shiftless,
weary Port Melbourne loafer, whose children had
been cared for by the State because he was too
fatigued to maintain them. He owed the depart-
ment some £70 on account of the youngsters, and,
being summoned therefor, explained that he
hadn’t the money, wasn’t likely to have it, and
didn’t care whether he ever had it. He further
assureu the court that he had passed many happy
hours in yaol; that he there found restful seclusion
and freedom from worry as to his daily tucker,
and that the court would confer a favor on him by
“retiring” him some more. Being assured by
the police that this was strictly accurate,
and that C. Anderson’s constitution seemed
to require periodical spells of rest, the
court did its best to disoblige him by turning him
loose and cancelling the arrears. It was all it
could do, so C. Anderson, solely by reason of his
weariness, is above the law. An entrenchment of
exhaustion secures him from attack, and he retires
to his fastnesses of sleep. The Victorian law
only allows imprisonment in such cases, and C.
Anderson likes imprisonment, as a sheltered and
horizontal condition in which his food is
brought to him regularly, so he can scoff at the
statutes. If a gaol was also a huge factory where
profitable work was carried on, and C. Anderson,
during his incarceration, had to toil on the full
jump for nine or ten hours a day to earn money
to support his children, he would probably decide
that it was easier to work eight hours a day
outside. Then the law would distinctly “get the
bulge ’’ on C. Anderson. But the simple idea of
making our steel rails in gaol hasn’t reached
Victoria yet.

Lighthouse inspection as practised in
N.S.W. On a recent “tour of inspection” by
the Navigation Department along the N.S.W.
coast the “ picnickers ” arrived off the Heads of a

were straightway brought ashore by the local tug
from the Victoria, which remained outside. At
two o’clock Sunday morning they commenced in-
specting the lighthouse and adjacent cottages
with the aid of a small lantern. Aftera “thorough
inspection,” lasting about ten minutes, the party
returned to the yacht.

“Burglar Bill”: Bulletin writers on
weird spots never mentioned a haunted cell; per-
haps they never had one on their beat. A N.S.W.
country gaol had a haunted dark cell, and a dark
cell inhabited by a ghost is about the spookiest
place on record. You are locked in without a
light, and the ghost can rush through the keyhole
and biff you on the solar-plexus and dance away
again, while you lash out and hit thick atmosphere
that hasn’t been outside the apartment since the
gaol was built. A sleeping prisoner on two or
three different occasions was dragged off his
mat by the heels and pulled round the cell, and
No. 28, doing dark cells for abusing a warder,
came out with a black eye. One Good Friday
the gaol tough was in serving seven days, when
he started to yell like a regiment of bottle
collectors. When dragged out he informed the
warders and the prison doctor that the Saviour
carrying the cross had walked through the cell
and disappeared. The doctor cancelled the
remainder of the dark cell sentence, and the
tough was placed in the yards. He had twelve
months to do, but during that time he never came
before the visiting magistrate, so anxious was he
not to meet the Redeemer again. The man with
the black eye would never tell what a fight with a
ghost is like.

THE fIEANING OF THE TERM—
“ GOLD=FILLED.”
FEW people correctly understand the meaning of the term “Gold-filled” as
applied to our watch cases. Some seem to regard “ Gold-filled ” as a
form of electro plating—from which it is entirely different. Gold-filled
Watch Cases are intended as a substitute for solid gold, not only in
appearance, but in wear. A Solid Gold Watch Case is valued for its beauty—
for the gold look about it. The beauty and the gold-look are entirely on the
surface. The gold hidden away in the thickness of the case adds nothing
to its beauty, but does add greatly to its cost. To make a gold-filled
watch case an ingot of metal is placed between two ingots of solid 14-carat
gold, and the three are then rolled flat, forming a solid sheet with a thick out-
side of solid gold and a centre of metal. This centre adds strength and lessens
cost, but its presence cannot be detected unless the gold is cut away. It will
be seen that gold-filled has nothing in common with gilding or plating; the
former implying a substantial layer of solid gold, the latter meaning gold
deposited on the base metal article after it is made. Men who cannot afford to
buy a solid gold watch, and men who can afford to, but do not care to run the
risk of losing such a valuable article, are recommended to consider the advan-
tages attached to buying one of these Gold-filled Watches.

tion, definite, clear, and comprehensive. In order that it may be fully understood why
Warner’s Safe Cure
sures, as it does, all of the above-mentioned disorders completely and permanently, it must be realised
that each of them is but the manifestation of a diseased or inactive condition of the
KIDNEYS AND LIVER
If these vital organs are working freely and perfectly, none of the disorders in the list given can
afflict us. 1 Ins important fact will be fully realised by reading the following description of the won*
derful functions performed by the kidneys and liver.
The Kidneys filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine every day. In this
quantity of urine are dissolved about an ounce of urea, ten to twelve grains in weight of uric acid
wrL ether i_ W * t k other animal and mineral matter varying from a third of an ounce to nearly an ounce!
When the kidneys are in health, all this solid matter is in solution and is invisible. Directly the
kidneys, through either weakness or disease, become unfit to do their duty properly, a proportion of
the solid matter remains in the blood, becomes actively poisonous and causes us to suffer from uric
disorders such as Rheumatism, Gout, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Gravel
Stone, Bladder Troubles, and Bright’s Disease. A simple test to make as to the condition
of the kidneys is to place some urine, passed the first thing in the morning, in a covered glass, and
let it stand until next morning. If it is then cloudy, or there is a brick-dust like sediment, or if
particles float about in it, or it is of an unnatural color, the kidneys are not healthy, and no time must
be lost in adopting remedial measures, or Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some less serious but more
painful illness will result.
The Liver.— ln the liver various substances are actually made from the blood. Two or three
pounds of bile are thus made from the blood every day. The liver takes sugar from the blood
converts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able to again supply it to the blood’
gradually, as the latter requires enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is insoluble into
urea, which is completely soluble, and the liver also deals with blood corpuscles which have lived’their
life and are useful no longer. When the liver is inactive or diseased we suffer from Indigestion
Biliousness, Anaemia, Sick Headache and Blood Disorders. B
health of the liver and of the kidneys is so closely connected that it is almost impossible for
Che kidneys to be affected, and the liver to remain healthy, or vice versa.
nearly thirfcy ye f B since scientific research, directed specially to diseases of the Kidneys
and Liver, was rewarded by the discovery of the medicine now known throughout the world as
Warners Safe Cure. It was realised, at the outset of the investigation, that it was necessary

When Our Spine’s Had Time to Grow!
[For The Bulletin.]
We shall have a different country when our
Spine’s had time to grow,
We shall put a price on manhood when we run a
manly show;
We shall teach our little children that within our
bounding sea
There is room enough and work enough for such a
folk as We ;
We shall realise—l’m hoping—that our life must
be our own,
Not a feeble, poor possession of the land that
lends a loan ;
We shall realise —I’m hoping—we’ve a decent
plot to hoe
If we only buckle to it—when our Spine’s had
time to grow!
We shall have a sturdy nation —when our Spine’s
had time to grow,
Not a race of beery babblers all devoid of grit and
go;
We shall shake the throne of Tyranny and grip
the throat of Wrong,
We shall breathe a manly spirit in a poor and
sapless throng;
We shall run no more contented at our mother’s
apron string,
But, with Freedom’s aspiration, we shall rise on
Freedom’s wing ;
We shall laugh, in proudest scorning, at each
craven mean and low,
In the gallant time a-coming—when our Spine’s
had time to grow !
We shall feel this poor abasement—when our
Spine’s had time to grow;
How we duck at others’ bidding—how we dodge
a real foe.
We shall learn the manly lesson, with a new and
glad surprise,
That there’s little good in limping thro’ a rotten
lane of lies;
That it’s better for a nation and it’s better for a
man
To go marching to the forefront with an honest
rataplan,
Than to skulk behind another when the winds of
battle blow;
We shall truly, truly feel it—when our Spine’s
had time to grow !
We shall have no weary whining—when our
Spine’s had time to grow,
We 11 have done with poor repining—when our
Spine’s had time to grow ;
We shall rise up self-sufficient for the fronting of
the fray,
And the days of poor dependence shall be gone
for good and aye,
And the nations who neglect us as a feeble folk
and pale.
In their circle will receive us with a new and joy-
ful “Hail!”
And the paltry fears that fettered us to bondage
poor and low
.They shall part—and part for ever—when our
SPINE’S had time to grow !
Q.
P.L,
Seddon's Brass.
Arthur Griffith to The Bulletin :— Australia
is being 1 compelled to witness the sickening
spectacle of raging Jingoes like Seddon and his
crew, now that the slump in Jingoism has set in,
howling their protests against the importation of
Chinamen to work the Transvaal mines, when
every sane man knew that it was just for this one
purpose that the war was engineered by the mine
owners and their “ kept” press. As Seddon and
Co. are now pleading that they didn’t know it
was loaded, it may be just as well to show that
they did know, or, at any rate, should have known
all about it. The following are a few of many
public utterances of men in the know, published
before ever Milner forced his war on the Trans-
vaal:—
In his examination before the Industrial Commission,
before the outbreak of the war, Mr. Albu gave the fol-
lnte(estlng evidence upon the wage question
• ,■. native at the present time receives a wage which
is far in excess of the exigencies of his existence. The
native earns between 60s. and 60s. per month ”

assists us in bringing labor to this market."
bo much for Kaffir wages, now for white :
Are you of opinion that the wages paid to (white)
miners at the present moment are abnormal ? “ Yes.”
In an article in the Mining World, also prior to
the commencement of the war, appeared the
tallowing pregnant passage :
White wages have not been reduced in the past,
because the Outlanders desired to work together for
salvation, and any attack upon the white
laborers pay would have caused a split in the ranks.
MUST COMEDOWN! COnditions P revai >. WHITE WAGES
While the war was still in progress, and Seddon
organising and despatching contingents,
the Hon. P. Lets, M.L.C., had an article in the
.Nineteenth Century suggesting that
As there is now no Boer Government to prevent it, the
5""“° e .. r ° f Mines should import a few thousand China-
men to take the place of white miners.
About the same time Earl Grey, at a meeting of
the Chartered Company, speaking of South Africa
generally, said :
• T1 ?ey must dismiss from their minds the idea of develop-
ing their mines with white labor. P
J. A. Hobson in his book, “The War in South
Africa Its Causes and Effects,” published during
the nrst year of the war, says :
Put in a concise form, it may be said that this war is
being waged m order to secure for the mines a cheap
adequate supply of labor. This need has been a pressing
and a growing one. The last report of the Chamber of
rUt?nn SS** h l6 f natter thus : “ Under the permanent con-
dition of shortage of supply (of black labor) which has
prevailed, it is clear that under stress of competition the
tendency would have been to gradually increase wages ”
«< Car i- ? uccessf ully accomplished, and a
th r Batlsfa ctory to the mine-owners can be
reached, the first fruits of victory will be represented in
a large, cheap submissive supply of black and whit”
a -ii° r aa tte -n- ed such other economies of “ costs ”as
will add millions per annum to the profits of the mines

money of the people of Great Britain are being spent for

ing the South African press and political organisations.
engineered the agitation which has issued in this war are
the same men whose pockets will swell with this increase.
Now all of these were widely-published utterances
of admittedly representative men—they were
made and published either before the war broke
out or during its earlier stages, while we were
still despatching oontingeuts—so that the men
who sent these contingents must have known the
object and the obvious result of the war. That
these men should now claim popularity by pro-
testing against the fulfilment of the object for
which the war was waged is only a proof that
they think the electors are fools—and a pretty
fair proportion of them are. Personally I prefer
the attitude of our avowed Colored Labor party*
and I am almost inclined to admire the consistency
of Cakkutheks and his crowd, who gave a solid
party vote a few months ago against my motion
asking the New South Wales Assembly to protest
against the importation of Chinese miners to the
Transvaal. There is some merit in being con-
sistent, even if it be in a cheap labor policy.
The Brummagem Business.
When the Commonwealth Parliament has a spare
evening it might do worse than deal with the
frauds of the shoddy jewellery trade. At pre-
sent an Australian, buying Australian-made
metal ware, can have no official guarantee what he
is paying for; and, as a rule, about nothing else
that he buys does he know less. Not even the
most experienced buyer can tell whether what he
is paying for as 15 carat gold is really that or only
12 carats ; yet the difference in each ounce would
mean about 9s. The less experienced—which in-
cludes most people—cannot even tell whether
what they are buying is solid gold, more or less
alloyed, or only “rolled” gold—copper, most
likely, with a thin coating of gold over it. They
have to wait for 18 months or a couple of years to
find out the difference, unless they happen to
carry the article to a pawnshop meantime. And
naturally the jewellery business, being a traffic in
which fraud is thus so easily possible, is a traffic
to which swindlers pay particular attention. If
for no other reason than that, the public ought to
be protected—by the setting up of a Common-
wealth establishment at which articles of jewellery
might be tested and officially stamped. But there
is another reason. English-made jewellery can
be hall-marked; in fact, plenty of jewellery
made in Europe outside Great Britain, and
intended for sale in England or Australia,
is taken to England to be hall-marked. So
long, therefore, as foreign-made stuff can be
sold with this official guarantee, while no
such guarantee can be given with Australian-
made goods, the sale of the latter is prejudiced ;
and so the Australian Protective tariff fails to do
the work it ought to do. If Australia would give
its own honest manufacturers a chance to get the
same guarantee that the foreigner can get, the
last remnant of excuse for purchasing gold and
silver goods from countries which don’t themselves
produce either gold or silver, while we produce
both, would disappear. That would be one way
of doing the work, only it wouldn’t be doing it
all—it would simply provide manufacturers a
means to issue a State guarantee with their goods,
if and when they wanted it. The wise buyer
would, of course, demand the guarantee with
the goods; but buyers of jewellery are
not always wise, and the jewellery trade
shark would be pretty certain to invent reasons
why the hall-mark wasn’t there. The other way
would be to stamp all gold and silver ware,
giving the manufacturer or the importer no
option in the matter. The more or less sanguine
persons who deck themselves with tawdry
brummagem might feel hurt if their bangles
and brooches and other fixings were branded
h carat, and if they felt sufficiently hurt to leave
the rubbish in the darkest drawer in their homes
the landscape would not suffer in the least;
after a while even the persons themselves might
feel all the better for having left off their silly
little lies and frauds.
A woman on the subject of Australia’s empty
cradle :
Will you give a woman who has thought much about
the empty cradle, and whose own is designedly empty at
present, space to make a few suggestions. Whatever
may be said, it rests with us whether the cradle remains
empty. With those women who can afford every help
and yet refuse to take their share of the burden for their
country’s sake, I have nothing to do. But there are a
great number who cannot afford any outside help, only
bare necessaries, and those amongst them who think,
feel, as I do, perfectly justified in limiting their
families. The burden of several children, and keeping
them and a little home decent, is too great for one.
Why not, as.it has been made a State question, give the
woman a little help ? A band of State-paid mothers-
helps—what good they could do ! It is not only a nurse
just for the month that is needed, but help before, when
a woman is unfit for toil and suffers, and help after, that
she may sometimes have a few hours free from the dear
children who always are so exacting with their mother.
Such would benefit the children most of all. Much
has been written of the blessedness of maternity ; little of
how heavily “the curse of Evb ” falls on those whose
means are limited and uncertain, or surely men would
know why thinking women deliberately refuse to bear
a burden which they feel is beyond their power.
Which, after all, only bears out The Bulletin’s
contention when it published the article headed
“ Depopulation ” (25/2/’O4). It isn’t the question
of bringing children into the world, but of rearing
them up afterwards, which makes the difficulty.
The country with an immense death-rate has also
an immense birth-rate—there is no scruple about
bringing child No. 8 into the world when children
Nos. 1 to 7 are mostly dead and have ceased to
cost anything. After all, Australia has even now
the largest net birth-rate save one—the largest
surplus, in proportion to population, of births
over deaths—in the world, so things might be
worse. When there is more work for the people
—when Australia gets over the Pumpkin Smith
disease and finds work for its citizens in making
the things that it now imports—things will pro-
bably improve. It is impossible to have a large
birth-rate and the Pumpkin Smith leprosy at the
same time.

“Disloyal” England.
* INQO Bill,” a correspondent to the British
Australasian, maintains that disloyalty to “the
Empire ’’ i 3 a charge to be brought against Britain
rather than Australia. After instancing the
British toleration of the annexation of a part of
Papua by Germany, and of French convict settle-
ment in New Caledonia, “ Dingo Bill ” shrewdly
remarks:
The fact of the matter is that, out in Australia, they
are again feeling, what every Australian who visits
London must feel everyday of the week, that the Empire,
which the colonials have believed to exist, must remain a
thing of the future—or of the past—so long as Great
Britain persists in her open disloyalty. Australia is sur-
rounded by mementoes of the past disloyalty of this un-
reliable old country. A few years ago, however, it really
seemed that such blunders might be spoken of in the past
tense.
A good many of us certainly believed so. Those who
did not are now able to point to the swarm of Chinese
just about to descend upon the Transvaal, and say, “ You
fought for this.” They can run a forefinger along the
Alaska Arbitration Award, and say, “You fought for
this." They can point to the newest ally of the Empire—
a colored savage race, with a thin veneer of Western
civilisation—able to grapple with the strongest military
Power in the world ; they can demonstrate the possible
complications arising for the Empire out of such a situa-
tion, and say, “You also fought for this.” The precise
retort that would leave the colonial loyalist with a verbal
advantage does not ocour to me.
Other matters complained of are English press
slanders of Australia, and British contempt for
everything Australian bub its cricket, and this
home-thrust concludes:
If Great Britain were loyal to the Empire the fact
would be apparent in smaller things. The magistrate
who released a dangerous criminal on condition that his
friends despatched him forthwith to ** one of our
colonies;” would be promptly sacked. ... I hope that
when these islands assume their proper position of
insignificance in the scale of Empire, the dominant
colonial races will remember what is due to themselves,
and to the little spot from which they sprung. I feel sure
that no proposition will emanate from South Africa for
planting a Chinese colony in Cornwall, to work the
neglected tin-mines there ; nor are the Australians ever
hkely to seriously advocate the swapping of Ireland to
Germany for that part of New Guinea which was so
disloyally fooled away by their incompetent dominant
partner.

Hardly any nibbing with Sunlight Soap.
The Sunlight Maids say it’s child’s play.
Will wash anything, but to secure best results with least labor should be used
in the Sunlight way. First dip the articles to be washed in a tub of lukewarm
water and draw it out of the water on a wash board and rub the soap over it
lightly. Then roll them up tightly and lay u.ider the water. Leave them
there for thirty minutes and let Sunlight Soap do its work. Commence
rubbing the clothes l.'gh.ly on the wash board and the dirt will drop out.
Turn the garments inside out to get at the seams but don’t use any more soap.
No need to scald or boil a single piece and don’t wash through two suds.
Rinse in lukewarm water taking care to wash out all the dirty suds, then ring
out and hang out to dry. That’s the Sunlight way. It makes the clothes
snowy white.
Sunlight Soap washes the clothes ivhite and won't injure the hands.

MANAGER GARTH’S REPUTATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Y 7. H. Garth, the new District Traffic Manager
of Romahapa Section, was making a clean and
far-reaching sweep. He had shunted half-a-dozen
drunken station-masters from the Block Signal
zone to paltry country stations, where by no
means could they interfere with train-running.
Some of the non-paying country stations he had
closed up, removing the officers in charge to
sidings, which he converted into stations. If
there was anything in Garth’s “improvements,”
then the Old Man, who had just gone up a step,
ought really to have been dropped ignominiously
out of the service.
During the few weeks Garth had been on the
section he had established a reputation for dis-
covering things. The staff grew scared ; when-
ever it struck anything unusual it immediately
divined that it was a dark trick of Garth’s to find
out something. So the staff went warily, and
when it found sixpence over in its cash it
promptly made fourteen entries relating thereto
and reported the matter at great length and with
considerable promptitude.
Manager Garth was a stark, ruthless man. He
towered up head and shoulders over even Fluter,
the Traffic Clerk, who was in appearance reminis-
cent of a telegraph-pole. But with his great
height he combined girth, and when Garth
stalked down the platform or across the shunting
yard, Wagpoleof the Goods, who was classically
inclined, said he reminded him of Satan in “Para-
dise Lost.”
He started to shuffle the staff round as though
he were playing cards, and Knutsford suddenly
found himself torn out of his warm nest in favor
of Goods Agent Laurence, and sent to work hard
in the cool shade of Traffic Cierk Fluter.
* * * *
Mongataranui was a lonely little place just out-
side Puketapu Junction, and the only houses in
sight were distant homesteads. Why there had
.ever been a station-master there no one could
understand. Garth closed it the first week of his
reign.
Knutsford swung himself off No. 16, and
drank in the scented gale, for all round the station
were giant hawthorn trees and great sycamores.
1 lie beautiful hawthorns were all in blossom, red
and white alternately, and they ran away along
the main road till the double line dwindled into
one and was lost round the shoulder of the hill.
KnuisfonL had come out to remove the ticket-
cabinets, which had by some oversight been left
behind when the station was closed up. He un-
locked the door and entered the pokey little
office. It had a deserted, chilly look. TheS.M.
fiad only been away a week, and already every
corner was thick with cobwebs. With true British
instinct Knutsford first examined the till, to see if
any half crowns had been overlooked in the
abandonment; but naked emptiness stared him
m the face.
He unlocked the ticket-cabinets, and, in open-
ing them, dislocated a whole system of spider
webs. One huge, fatherly old' insect dropped
down within an inch of Knutsford’s nose to inves-
tigate, and, seeing it was a detested man, began
to ascend again with all speed.
ff° to Hades!” said Knutsford, hitting out
wi dly with his list of tickets, and knocking the
spider into the cabinet, where it disappeared into
a crack. Knutsford whittled down his penholder
and jammed it into the crack, and probed every-
,toP bnin£ fell out of the cabinet with a
1 tie cloud of dust. The spider had disappeared,
ut a little ptircel of dirty paper was jammed into
ttie space. As the sheets fluttered awav one by
note«. KnUtSf ° rd SaW tll6y W6re Colonial ' Bank £1
Knutsford snorted. So Garth was testing his
honesty, was he ? Well, he’d fall in. He made a
little parcel of the notes and put them in his
pocket, ihen he tied up the two cabinets, had a
fina! look round the office, and locked-up just as
oi j-j U ” ced her wklstle in the distance,
b, . f hdn t come to a standstill, but slowed down
sufficiently for him to pass the cabinets to Guard
i, .! e J and s , w "ig himself on board. Then they
rolled down the avenues of hawthorns and syca-
mores, till presently Bradley, went through the
carriages to collect Terawhiti tickets. Knutsford
cautiously lifted the trap-door of the right-hand
clog-box. An ominous growl made him let it down
with a bump. The left hand one was, however,
empty He put a mail-bag under his knees, and
carefully felt the sides and top for a cranny in
which to stow the notes. There was none, and,
as the guard might return at any moment, Knuts-
the package in the corner on the floor
of the dog-box and went back to the window seat,
intending to take it out of the box sometime in
the afternoon before the van again left Romahapa.
it there was any stern inquiry for the money in
the interval Mr. Knutsford intended to indig-
nantly demand an instant search of his person.
it was six p.m. before Knutsford got a chance
to go to the van, and by that time it was at
the platform on No. 31 South, and being rapidly
tilled up with parcels and baggage. The S M
the most perfect gentleman on the Maoriland
railways, was on duty, and somehow the van
never seemed to be empty for a moment.
Knutsford stepped inside. Guard Millar was
sorting his parcel invoices into the respective
station pigeon-holes. Knutsford got into the
window seat nearest the dog-box.
‘‘Where you off to?” asked the Guard.
1 m going out as far a'' Ballantyre 1 ” replied
the treasure seeker.
Well, get into one of the carriages—the S M
won t let anyone leave here in the van. You can
come in again at Ranelagh, if you like.”
~ y° u arc, ’’ .said Knutsford, getting on to
the platform just in time to meet two porters
navigating a savage bull-dog with window hooks
in his collar.
“Where’s he going to, Meredith?” he asked
the porter.
xr„ Po ? at r doesn ’t break loose and eat
Mil ar before lie gets there,” said the porter.
• it '«. n I they put that savage brute into the box
m which the money lay, a „d Knutsford decided
not to go to Ballantyre that afternoon. Popa-
tunoa was the terminus, 60 miles away, and it was
obviously necessary to wait till that dog had left,
even if the Crown of Great Britain and Ireland
was in the box.
* » * * -
When the train arrived at Popatunoa at 9.15,
Jimmy the Rake pompously informed Guard
Millar that he’d take any cur out of a dog-box,
and he wasn’t going to keep the van waiting all
night till the owner of the flaming dog finished
drinking. Then he lifted the inside trap door,
grabbed the chain, and started to haul the dog
into the van. The brute came out with a rush,
and Guard Millar took a flying loip from the van
just as the dog bit Jimmy the Hike for the third
time.
After this little excitement the lad porter
arrived to sweep out the van. He removed the
traces of Jimmy’s acquaintance with the dog, and
propped up the trap-door while he swept out the
box. The second dive of the broom brought out
the paper parcel. «
After the lad porter had opened that parcel and
found it to contain 22 Colonial Bank of Maoriland
.£1 notes, he sat on top of the dog-box and thought
hard for 20 minutes, and finally decided that it
was a trick of Manager Garth’s to test his honesty.
Having arrived at that decision he carefully tied
them up again, and placed them in the most in-
accessible corner of the dog-box, with a mental
reservation that if they came back again from
Romahapa they’d stay in Popatunoa.
Next morning Guard Millar, of No. 4 North,
Popatunoa to Romahapa, was rather astonished
to be boarded at a small siding, 20 miles from
Romahapa, by Mr. Knutsford and a bicycle.
After discussing the weather Guard Millar dis-
coursed fluently on the tremendous traffic in dogs.
He ascribed it to the rush of shepherds to the
North Island, because the squatters were all ex-
tending their runs. “I’ve got two blessed dogs
in each box this very morning, all going to Roma-
hapa.”
Mr. Knutsford cursed and then apologised, and
said it was sudden cramp in the right calf.
Millar went off to issue tickets to some passengers
from the last siding.
* * • •
When he got back Knutsford had disappeared,
although his bike was still in the van. Millar was
scared ; he rushed out on to the tail-board and
strained his eyes down the track to see if the
young officer had fallen out.
As he stepped back into the van an angry
inquiry—“ Are you there, Millar?”—made the
guard jump. He gazed stupidly round the van,
for the voice sounded muffled and far off, and
wondered if he was dreaming.
A volley of oaths and another frantic inquiry :
“Are you there, Millar ? Damn you ! why don’t
you answer ? ”
“Where the blazes are you, anyhow?” said
Millar as soon as he could speak.
“In the blanky dog-box ! Lemme out.”
“Well, I’m blowed!” said the guard : “Which
dog-box ? ”
This one, you fool!—the right-hand one.”
“ Well, if my van isn’t good enough to travel
in I’d try a first-class carriage, and not the dog-
box,” said Millar as lie cautiously opened the
trap-door.
Two collies shot out, and then Knutsford
dragged himself into view, and the collies were
recaptured and shoved in by main force.
“ What's the game, anyhow?” asked Millar.
Knutsford told him, and Millar promptly
demanded half the loot.
“ But I haven’t got it—it’s gone.”
“You were a fool not to tell me last night, and
we’d have had it all safe by this time; now Jimmy
the Rake or his lad porter’s got it.”
* * * *
As the train drew up at Romahapa platform the
S.M. stepped on board, and was horrified at the
dirty state of the van. He also complained that
the presence of dogs was distinctly in evidence.
Ten minutes later Sweeper Macguire received
orders to clean out F 203, and protested to the
S.M. about having to sweep out Popatunoa vans.
The S.M. was decisive.
“You go and obey orders—and pay particular
attention to those dog-boxes—they are very malo-
dorous.”
Sweeper Macguire worked on the dog-boxes so
viciously that he knocked the head off his broom
in one of them, and, much to his disgust, had to
get three parts of his body inside to recover it.
He found the broom-head against the wall of the
box, where a little brown parcel was concealed
under traces of dog. He pulled it out, and, when
he got into the sweeter atmosphere of the van,
cautiously opened one end of it.
He gasped; then a cunning smile overspread
his features. He understood now why the S. M.
laid stress on the dog-box. That officer meant to
bowl him out in an act of flagrant d'shonesty.
He fastened up the money and started for the
S.M.’s office. On the way doubt fell upon him,
and he slipped back to the van and again dis-
appeared, all but his legs from the knees down-
ward. As he emerged he made a careful note of
the number of the van. This time the notes were
in a crack in the dog-box roof.
* * • *
It was Guard Millar’s day off, and Jimmy the
Rake sat in the window seat of F 203. M'Kenzie,
the fisherman, had got in at Mertondale with 12
trout, and with many hiccoughs presented Jimmy
with a pot-bellied one. The other one to which
Jimmy had already helped himself reposed in
the right-hand dog-box. M'Kenzie was, he
reckoned, too drunk to notice one trout missing in
eleven.
They stopped at the platform with a jerk ;
M'Kenzie came staggering down to the van.
“ Whar’s ma fush, Jimmy ? ”
“Here you are, Mr. M'Kenzie,” said Jimmy
with all the affability he could muster.
“Thank ye, Jimmy.”
Then he counted them—one, two, three, and so
on to ten. He counted them twice, and then
staggered up to the van door and called out :
“Jimmy, you swindlin’ thief; bring oot ma
other fush. D’ye think A’m a fule ; bring oot ma
troot. A had 12 troots, an’ a gave ye a pot-
bellied one, an’ that’s one for ye and 11 for me ;
an’ a hae but 10 troots here the noo; ye son o’ a
border cattle lifter.”
Jimmy’s luck was right out. The S.M., who
was passing, turned, and, worse than all, the giant
figure of Manager Garth stalked down the plat-
form, the personification of dignity; it s wonder-
ful what a lot of dignity attaches to a corporation
if it is carried properly.
The S.M. turned to inquire the cause of the
trouble; and M'Kenzie, >ow thoroughly angrv,
told the story. The S.M. turned on t e guard
and asked what he meant by taking gifts from
passengers. The Manager came up and listened
attentively. Jimmy was sent to the guards’ room
to aurait the result of a search. They looked in
the racks, among the parcels, in the drawers and
the pigeon-holes ; but could find no trace of the
missing and the Manager decided that
M'Kenzie -must have made a mistake. That
sportsman was sitting on the top of the dog-box
blinking at them as they searched. When they
told him he had made a mistake he asked them
why they didn’t look into the box he was sitting
on. &
The manager smelt the box; then poked his
heaa out of the van and hailed a lad porter passing
wRh a broom and bucket. _
I want you to see if there’s a trout in either of
these dog-boxes.”
The youth got down on all-fours and searched one
box and declared it empty. Then he dived into
the other and immediately started to back out.
There was a sound of a sudden tearing of clothes
as the back of his coat caught in something, and
then he exclaimed, “This feels like it! ”
As he backed out into the light the Manager
grabbed at a parcel that rested between his
shoulders, and the S.M. took the paper parcel
frorn his hand and displayed the trout.
The Manager opened the parcel he had grabbed,
and whistled softly.
_** * *
Ten minutes later Manager Garth was back in
his office. Fluter, the Traffic Clerk, was out.
Mr. Knutsford answered the bell.
“ Knutsford, I’ve found out something ! ”
“That’s nothing new, sir !” said Knutsford.
Manager Garth smiled; he liked the reputation
he had acquired.
“But this, Mr. Knutsford, is unique. Fifteen
years ago I was clerk at Mongataranui—there
was a big trade there in those days; just as much
as I could keep pace with. One day the bank
cash, £22, all in Colonial Bank notes, mysteri-
ously disappeared. The S.M. said I must have
taken it. I hadn’t, and I promptly accused him.
He kept me in the office and telegraphed here. A
Relieving Officer came out, and my luggage was
searched, and I was sent in here next train. The
train after me brought the S.M., the Relieving
Officer taking charge. As the cash was in my
care I had to pay it. That S.M. was run over in
Romahapa the day he came in—which was
another reason why they made me pay it. To-
day I had occasion to search Guard Poulter’s van,
and I found a trout he had stolen from a pas-
senger; and, strangest of all, 22 Colonial Bank
one-pound notes, very old, very faded, and corres-
ponding in date to those lost at Mongataranui.
Will you please take steps to have Guard Poulter
arrested for stealing one trout and 22 Colonial
Bank notes. ”
Mr. Knutsford hesitated, and then he explained
briefly and to the point.
Manager Garth leaned back and looked inter-
ested. “These are my notes all right, and I’m
going to annex them—in fact, they are annexed,”
he said as ho stuffed them into his pocket. “ Per-
haps we’d better only disrate Jimmy the Rake,
after all. Now I’m going to find out the details
from the time you put ’em in the dog-box till they
came out on that porter’s back.”
And he did, with great tact and diplomacy ;
and his mana was great from Whangarei to the
Bluff.

Do not disregard the warning message of the back that aches ; stop it in time —for the ache
comes from the kidneys (which lie just beneath the small of the back), and distinctly tells that
uric acid poisons, and waste matter, are accumulating in your body. These are the poisons that
cause dropsy, Bright’s disease, rheumatism, bladder troubles, urinary disorders, diabetes.
Only kidneys that are in health can keep the body free from fluid pois( ns. The genuine
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills bring the kidneys back to health, cleanse them, strengthen them,
give them new life. With the first dose of this kidney medicine, the great work of driving out the
fluid poisons will begin in real earnest, and within a week or so rich, sweet blood
will course through your veins, the color will begin to return to your cheeks,
heavy eyes, aching limbs, weak back, sick headaches, sleepless nights, dizzi-
ness, and nervousness will be but a memory.
WOMAN S LASTING CURE.
MRS. M. MULLINS, 49 Hunter-street, this city, says: “For about three
years I suffered with Kidney Derangement. The worst symptom was a constant
Backache, which became more painful whenever I stooped much. I tried many
remedies for this complaint, and the results were anything but beneficial, but
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills permanently cured me. When I say ‘cured,’ I
mean that it is over twelve months since I used these pills, and I’ve had no return
of the old pain. I have advised many people to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
and all have obtained very good results from their use.”

The Pessimist.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I met him at the Anchor Inn,
The hero of my tale ;
While ’midst the smoke and vulgar din
Flowed fast the dubious ale.
There with a motley crowd, I saw
Him seated, well at ease,
A short clay pipe was in his jaw,
A pint pot on his knees.
His face was seared with many a line,
And o’er his features free
The rude trade-marks of wind and brine
Were stamped indelibly.
I longed to learn by heart what lay
Beneath that visage grim,
And in an unassuming way
Some questions put to him.
He took between his finger-tips
His pipe as black as coke ;
He drew one hand across his lips,
Then waved aside the smoke.
“ Yes, mate,” he said, “ I’m sailin’ still
In them old sailin’ craft ;
Of wind-bags I ’ave ’ad my fill—
Square-rigged an’ fore-’n’-aft!
“ Tried steam ? Not me ! I sticks to these
Old battlers. They’ave bore
Me over ’Orstralasian seas
This forty year or more.
“ Yer steamboats —bah ! I tell yer they
’As been this country’s curse ;
For who’ll deny since they’ve ’eld sway
That things is ten times worse ?
“ In those old days, when we was free
Good wages to demand,
They wanted us—they wanted me !
By men their ships were manned !
“ Sailors ! I tell yer they’re not fit
To pole an old mud-barge !
Yet everywhere they flourish its
An A.B.’s good discharge !
“ And every blarsted country lout
Must be a sailor bold.
They ship ’em, too, and chuck us out—
Real sailors, in the cold !
“ I mind me well the days gone by
(Glad days—shipmates o’ mine !)
While men was scarce an’ wages ’igh
For work we did not pine !
“ I’ve left an old Black Di’mond ship—
(They’ve gone now, one by one)
And on a Yankee took a trip,
For fifty pound the run !
“ Yes ! they ’ave gone behind the scenes,
And o’er Time’s edge have rolled—
And in their place are damned machines
With fair winds in the hold ! ”
I ventui-ed then the meek remark,
“What ship did last you know ? ”
He said : “ A little Hobart barque
I left, three weeks ago.
“They built their own ships there, about
The time when things did hum ;
And on the Derwent turned ’em out,
Good stringy-bark an’ gum !
“ And e’en to-day the Tassies feel
The pangs of Used-to-be —
They’ve crushed—these giant craft of steel —
Their one lone industry.
“ Ah ! mate, this bloomin’ country’s done ! ”
(A round, colossal tear
A-down his wizened cheek did run
And dropped into his beer.)
And then with providential tact
As he did pipe his eye,
I drew attention to the fact
His pot was nearly dry.
“Yes, mate ! I don’t mind if I do;
I’ll ’ave the same—ah, well !
This blessed country through an’ through
Is straightway bound for ’ell ! ”
He took the pint-pot in his fist
And wished me lots of cheer ;
And so I left my pessimist
Communing with his beer.

The Great Writer
[FOR THE BULLETIN.] .
It was Simpson of the Reflector, who sits in
his chair all day reading those silly proofs of
theirs, smiling absurdly to himself when he comes
across what he thinks is a good thing, and who
tells you that you can't read one of Carruthers’
speeches without recognising a great statesman—
you know whom I mean. Well, he first told me
the great Bollingsby tradition.
Discovered quite by accident, it seems. Only
an ordinary, respectable man at first, out Auburn
way somewhere. He happened to write a letter
of remonstrance to the paper re drains or some-
thing. Just about four paragraphs or so, but the
Ruskinesque English of it so struck the editor that
he wrote back off-hand begging B. to accept a
responsible position on the staff.
And from that day—-well, lie’s Bollingsby. That’s
enough ! To think such a man as that stood near
to being wasted on a bank-managership or some-
thing of that kind !
Why, journalism is the life’s breath of him.
Look at his memory ! Gives you day and year for
everything—all out of Iris head !
Has his own vast indexed collection of statistics
—ali put together by himself—half a lifetime’s
work, filling the shelves of a large room, and any-
thing under the sun can be looked up in a minute
or so.
Some said he kept half-a-dozen separate tables in
his study, each with its little library and each de-
voted exclusively to a particular subject, and that
classification and method were the trumps of
Bollingsby’s hand.
Others, again, scorned the idea that he was a
man of the sort that could be made or helped by
the everyday devices of the ordinary hack.
A University scholar, they‘said^ aca pa b] e linguist
and of vast readiner, he d little or no u&e ior tne
cyclopaedia, the dictionary, the thesaurus, and
such things—he carried all his data in his head by
virtue of his superb memory, and was a walking
chronological table of all ‘things-the literary
machine par excellence. You just wound him up,
set him to any theme, and forthwith, with no
trouble on his part, there arose a pile of neatly
written MSS. of first quality, at the rate of about
2000 words an hour.
Some said he did most of his work (like Hall
Came) on sheets of white paper, sitting up in bed
i?!rc«ri eei i 4 in the morning, throwing le
MSS. about the floor as he wrote-leaving it to
the servants to come and arrange the mental pro-
duct in bales in the morning
Others said he invariably did it all on 6 ne co s-
cap with a quill pen, m the train, with an ink-
bottle slung round his neck like an old-time rate-
coUector. • . , .t> n- . ,
Others again insisted that Bollingsby s paper
had a green tinge, and .hat he wrote mostly up
trees with a lead pencil.
Ihe backwash of envy didn t pass him by. His
rivals were agreed that he was very much over-
rated-tlmt his vivacity and sparkle was as good
as annexed from the French. But he continued
to be a cathedral tower among them all the same.
Those m the know sa'd. that even le on on
Times had tried to inveigle him away into its
service, but (as everyone said, rejoicing y) to his
great honor Bollingsby stuck loyallj to the lit e
crown that Australia had to offer and to his
original patron the Mercury.
A grand man to read and to read of, and for
his country to be proud of, but a grander man
still to know, they said.
I never knew him personally, but it was common
talk that the best of him came out in private-
the moral beauty of the home life was how
gossip put it. It, above all things, made your
mouth water to,know the man.
Bollingsby, in the beautiful villa that they said
he lived in at Malvern, surrounded by his wife
and family—the latter understood to be all sizable
daughters, and handsome—Bollingsby unbending
himself jn this charming home circle, singing in a
rich baritone in the good old English glees around
the drawing-room piano-what a picture !-some-
thing to east in the teeth of those who are always
on hand with a sneer at the respectability of
journalism.
one n, >y n waa wa l tln ? for someone at the
corner of Pelham-street when a man came along
unsteady and husky. “Jus’ help me home,” he
said ; “ chonly a stone’s throw and I don’t want
to get run in.”
“Where?” said I, thinking I might have time
to see him about a hundred yards, not more.
“Jus’ th’ other side of the square.”
We soon got through the square, but he k pt
on down Cardigan-street and into the next sq are,
so I roughly said, “ You said it was close.”
He gave me the piteous look a dog gives
you before you send him out of your back-yard,
He’d grown heavy, too, and I’d got to go on or
lay him down, for I am undersized and he was
huge and bulky.
He started a running fire of slobbering gabble :
“ Man’s frens dean knowim when lie’s drunk.
Name’sh good enough, too—Jack Bollingsby—
that’s good enough—think, ain’t it ? ”
“What?”

We were now across Elizabeth-street into North
Melbourne, and he was going strong—that is,
while I staggered under the weight he held the
rudder> and by a lunge to the rigbt or left would
make the route towards some objective or other
ah ead that he wotted of.
My appointineilt had vanished by effluxion of
time, but I was submissively dumb now with
th responsibility of the charge of the great Bol-
]ingsby
We # tto about the lowest part of North
Melbourne and were in a narrow at reet of wooden
and galvaniaed . iron houses. It being a hot night,
a j} tbe doors were open, and the inhabitants
sitting on the atepa .
Suddenly, without the slightest warning, in
tbe twinkling of an eye, the weight was gone
off me> and the man ad abot through into an
open doorway, where I could see his progress
wa(J at once taken in hand by a big coarse woman
with a muscular arm as the door shut with a bang,
“You beast!” I could hear her say as I stood
dumbfouilde d in the street,
But nQ Qne took fche s i ig htest notice of me, so I
just went on and brush ed off any remains of con-
with the great Bollingsby that might be
about my person, thinking the while about the
“home life”

SMILAX.
The Victorian temperance people, having
made a bargain with the liquor party some years
ago that hotels should be closed by local option
with compensation, now want to go back on their
deal. They came to Premier Bent the other day,
and asked that in future hotels should be closed
without compensation. One reverend member of
the deputation got very angry when Bent re-
minded him of the bargain. He declared hotly
that the temperance party had been misled. A
lot of decayed matter was also got off about the
barmaid, and a request was made that she should
be abolished, say by instalments spread over five
years. Nothing was said about what the abolished
one was to do for her crust.

We consider your medicines to be most reliable, especially in Australia,
"where the climate is so trying.”
Do you suffer from indigestion? Tired all the time?" Unfit for work?
And easily discouraged ? The trouble with you is you are being slowly
poisoned. The impurities in your blood are getting the upper hand of you.
Why not get rid of these poisons? You can easily do it with Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla. This splendid medicine purifies the blood, builds up the nerves,
and enables you to throw off that terrible feeling of depression due to a
warm climate.
Do not risk any dangerous experiments. Take the old reliable “Ayer’s”
Sarsaparilla, not some other kind. Look out for substitutes.

“ T.D.”: The most painful of all stage spectacles is
that of thte understudy who has played a leading 1 part for
a week or two during the star’s iilness, but has had to
shift back to the position of walking lady or gentleman.
This happens more frequently in comic opera than any-
where else. After her meteoric burst, the chorus damsel
is assertive for a night or two in order to let the people
in front know that she is ready to take over the prin-
cipal’s job as a permanency, in preference to the high-
salaried noodle now in charge, if only the audience will
rise up and demand that she be promoted to her rightful
..nosh,ion ; but she probably gets reprimanded by the
stage manager for getting out of her position among the
rank and file, or for “overdressing” her part, or some-
thing. Then she crowds herself away into a corner and
sulks, and that is the end o i the meteor, for thq
management ceases to take any notice of her, and as a
rule she quits the show within a month or two, and plays
principal boy in a country-touring company which has a
mournful habit of forgetting “ the ghost.” The male
understudy who has achieved temporary greatness just
stands and glowers at his “study,” saving his opinions
for open expression in his favorite bar later on. -
The most dreaded day of the year for the super-aesthetic'
manager of a Melbourne musical conservatorium is the
one on which competitions are held for the annual
scholarships. This event came off a week ago, and the
Proi is still walking about with the crushed and confused
air of one who has seen hell in a nightmare. The aspirants
for singing honors were many, and their voices were
various, but the worst thing about them was that the
majority came along with music-hall ditties about
Doreen ’ and "similar nice girls, whilst a couple thought
they had ascended to classical regions when they pro-
duced “Under the Deodars,” from the “Country Girl.”
But the piano students were even worse. One of them
thumped out the “ Hiawatha "■melody, and another, in
short frock and a clean white pinny, played “The
Maiden’s Prayer,” beloved of our piano-learning grand-
mothers. Also, her ma was present, and insisted on
pointing out the beauties of that delectable composition
to an anguished professor.
“Nym.”: A train-ride in Melbourne is a feast of flesh
nowadays. When men are wearing l overcoats and cussing
the .cold sou’-wester, dozens of women board the tram
dummies wearing blouses cut as low as their low-cut cor-
sets, the rest of their exhibition forms being covered with
an airy cobweb of lace—back and front. But Annette
Kellerman’s diving antics at the aquarium are the nearest,
and most modest, display of the nude Melbourne will ever
get without Mrs. Grundy's gamp being raised in vehement
protest. Annette is a shapely lass, girlish to fascination,
plump and nimble—but not the best swimmer I have
seen. For outline, gymnastic ability, and attraction
generally she is unapproachable; and the innocent
manner in which she threads her way through the crowd,
hanging by their eyebrows to the corky scenery round
her splashing pond, is refreshing—seeing the, scarcity of
her apparel. Puzzled my head, during Annette's exhi-
bition of “ form,” how she gets in and out of her skin-
tight, dark blue garb.
Frank Lincoln, the monologist who can mix a “cock-
tail” with his mouth, is just now serving as a curtain-
raiser at a London theatre. That is to'say; he gives a
half-hour entertainment before the comedy commences.
The golden age is only just beginning for variety artists.
They,getdigger salaries than they earned at the’alls a
few years ago, when prices were deemed extravagantly
high, and now the theatres are competing with the ’alls
for the services of the brightest artists.
A curious libel case was settled in England t’other day.
Plaintiff was a beauty actress who had "had her portrait
taken showing her beautiful teeth prominently. An
enterprising dentist saw the picture in a magazine or on
a po-t card, and, not knowing that it represented any one
in particular, used it as an advertisement. Some of the
front teeth were “ blacked out,” and the picture in that
state showed a fright of a face, Then with the teeth
restored it displayed the srpiling triumph of dentistry.
Original sued for libel, claiming that the pictures alleged
that her teeth were false, which they were not. Defen-
dant didn’t go into court but paid damages and destroyed
the advertisements, so the plaintiff didn’t have her mouth
inspected by twelve strange men on the jury.
When ‘ the much-travelled Smythe was lately in Tas-
mania, on his way to Maoriland to pilot Presbyterian
Parson Ewen on his Scotch lecture tour through those
islands, he struck Hobart just as Sister Mary Paul (Madame
Christian), whom he “discovered” 35 years ago, was
there for her health, broken down by much teaching of
young Melbas, Castleses and Crossleys. And talking of
Ewen : He was minister at Burwood (Sydney), some ten
years ago, when the town clerk killed the mayor and
himself, and the bodies had to be removed from the Town
Hall by the inspector of nuisances. Ewen preached a
dramatic sermon on the subject. That old sermon might
come in handy now as a popular lecture, “ Tragedies I
Have Known.”
Bland Holt, who ha* recently acquired a dog with a
large jaw, is following in the track of other mumniers.
Yarmouth used to do Broadway with a bull-dog
—though Yarmouth’s claim to be a mummer rested
mainly on the dog. Henry Lee’s Dane, which died last
year and was buried with an advertising tombstone above
it, paid its meat-bill by stage appearances. And Johnny
Sheridan used to drag a pup about with him a good deal
—Galled it the Shaughraun. Holt’s new animal requires
a man on a bicycle to give it exercise when it’s not wanted
at the photographer’s, or in the pony-cart with Bland
and Mrs. Bland.
“A. 8." : Geelong (Vic.) municipal theatre is not
proving the success anticipated; in fact, it is a frost.
It has not been used by a dramatic co. since the opening
night last October. The Geelongese are in a state of
panic at the result of their enterprise. They imagined
that the possession of a theatre called “His Majesty’s”
would make Sleepy Hollow a live town. Instead of
relieving the rates, the spec, does not pay interest on the
borrowed £SOOO. His Majesty’s is shunned by the few
visiting companies which -have the courage to go that
way. It is too expensive for them.
“L. 8.”: It is said that Henry Arthur Jo- es’s latest
play is the best he has done. “ Joseph . .dangled ”
seems to be a finer bit of work than “The Liars,” to
which it has some slight resemblance, or relation. In
“The Liars” the people are actually lying, and having
an uncomfortable time at the pumps keeping the water
under. In “Joseph Entangled” they are not lying, but
telling the precise truth, whioh no one will believe. The
members of the family are absent from their town house,
but the wife has to come down to town on urgent busi-
ness. Only the butler and housekeeper are on the
premises. The housekeeper attends to her mistress, who
goes to bed. Then enters a friend of the family, who at
one time had an attachment with the wife. He has lost
his luggage, and cannot very well put up at an hotel. The
butler, who was once his own servant, reckons the best
thing for him is to stay the night at the house. The
friend of family does so, and next morning he and the
wife, much to their surprise, mee't at breakfast. There'
are explanations, and even some love-making. They
agree to depart to their respective destinations at once.
But luck is against them, and people inopportunely turn
up. The wife and the friend explain the peculiar posi-
tion, and, of course, are politely disbelieved. Something
happens in the end to prove that the prospective respon-
dent and co-respondent were as innocent as new-born
babies or freshly-spawned alligators ; but there is a long
and complicated struggle before truth prevails, and it
prevails with great difficulty.
