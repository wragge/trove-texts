JACK LINDSAY'S SYDNEY
In The Roaring Twenties (Bodley
Head) Jack Lindsay goes on from “Life
Rarely Tells,” the Brisbane section of
his autobiography up to his 21st year,
to his Sydney years, from 1921 until
1926, when he went to London.
His main accomplishments during
these years were his marriage, the
establishment of the magazine “Vision”
and meeting a lot of people. Some of
the people, like Beutler the piano-
tuner and musical-instrument salesman
who composed advanced music, Pillig,
who made plaster-casts, a girl starting
as a dancing-instructress and the crowd
that gathered at “Betsy’s,” where
Brennan, McKee Wright, Unk White,
George Finey and others drowned dull
care, are most interesting for the back-
ground Lindsay is able to build around
them; what used to be called the
“bohemian,” what today would be the
“beatnik,” life of Sydney in the 1920
boom.
To the present reviewer, who never
met Jack Lindsay, and missed the set-
up he describes by several years, it is
still a faithful picture of a side of
Sydney that didn’t have to wait until
the depression to feel depressed:
Brennan, Pillig and Beutler might well
symbolise the stultified state of the
arts in Sydney at that time, or Jack
Lindsay himself, fuming in a mist of
music, philosophy, poetry and girls.
On the other hand, in the rejoicing
of Hugh McCrae, who fortunately
never needed much to rejoice upon, in
Leon Gellert’s being around, and in
Norman Lindsay’s being available at
Springwood, Jack Lindsay had some-
thing of solid Australian accomplish-
ment to reassure him; and in Slessor
and R. D. Fitz Gerald he met the best
young talent in Australia.
He writes with real affection of
Slessor, then a worried young journalist
newly married to an exquisite wife, and
of Fitz Gerald, happy enough to dis-
cuss poetry over coffee at Mock bells
while awaiting the business that comes
so slowly to a freshly set-up young
surveyor. Living, himself, with his
brother Ray in a practically un-
furnished room at ss. a week in William
Street, eating by meal-ticket (how he
got enough money to buy even meal-
tickets in those early days he doesn’t
really explain) in back-street cafes,
Lindsay couldn’t understand why
Slessor and Fitz Gerald went to work:
even today he seems to feel that Slessor
might have been a better poet if he had
given up the sordid business of earning
a living.
Yet in the end Lindsay worked as
hard as anyone; opposite the title-page
of this autobiography are listed more
than 60 books by Jack Lindsay, none,
altogether or separately, the equivalent
of the small book of 103 poems which
is Slessor’s life-work. Lindsay’s
account of “Vision” is a little subdued
because he realises this:—
The best things in “Vision” were
Norman's stories and Ken’s verse. I
was nowhere in comparison.
But that wasn’t so obvious at the
time. Moreover, there was this to be
said for Jack Lindsay’s daimonic essays
and enthusiastic poetry: that they
created an atmosphere where art could
happen—where, in fact, anything could
happen. The impact of his writing on
young imaginations was considerable.
One can remember, around 1929-30,
taking “Vision” in with Lindsay’s Lon-
don venture, the “Aphrodite,” and
wondering what godlike being this
might be, who actually understood
Beethoven in poetry and Nietzsche in
prose, and romped around in Sydney
parks in the moonlight with beautiful
girls without any clothes . . . Alas, that
girl in the park; she inhabits pages
175-179 of this autobiography; she was
very small and very young; they went
in fact and in ferries to Sydney parks
and bushlands at night-time; she was
passive, but he was afraid, and nothing
really happened ... It is as though he
had shattered an article of one’s
juvenile faith; there are things an
author should not confess, especially
his innocence.
There are a few other things that
needn’t have been mentioned; one can
understand Lindsay’s rancor against a
few of the critics of “Vision,” but what
John Dailey did to Henry Lawson
hardly justifies what Lindsay says
about John Dailey, and the terriw
stories Lindsay has to tell about aT
Brennan hardly need theft>
descant he plays on Brennan’s char"
ter. Maybe the natural charm of i
McCrae letters, with their f a l e
drawings, disarms the circumstanced
their production; and there is a simi]
charm in the stories about the yoj
musician he calls “Laurence,” and J
their invasion of actresses’ bedroom
with erudite discussions of music ani
poetry while the perplexed actresses
looked on; and there is a down-to
earth chapter on the painter Elioth
Gruner and his cottage at Tamara®
done-out in soft greys and blues.
Interpolated pieces by his brother
Ray, who died this year, remind one
how well Ray Lindsay could write;
unobtrusive, glad to be of service’
objective, a quiet, watercolor character
(in his writing), he opposes the passive
charm of an Aubrey to Jack’s more
violent and tendentious prose.
All-in-all. it is an honest pictured
bohemian Sydney in the 1920’5, of the
Artists’ Ball when it really was wild,
of the Kirtley Press printing by hand
what machines were too proud to
touch, the edges of its privations, boil
of money and of art, softened by tint;
We who now luxuriate in a great sym-
phony orchestra that produces no com-
posers. a multitude of art-exhibitions
that produce mostly wall-paper, and
television that produces what it pro-
duces, may even wonder whether our
present boom is any improvement on
the old one.

The Novel Orwell Hated
A Clergyman’s Daughter, no*
reissued by Seeker and Warburg, is
a novel of George Orwell’s nonags
(1935) —that is, of the period before
he began consciously to strive for that
fusion of political and personal pur-
pose which he described in a later essay
and which he rarely achieved in fiction
But why did he come to loathe it so
much as to refuse to have it re P
lished in his lifetime and to buy-u?
stray copies of it and destroy them;
“Looking back through my work
[he wrote in 1947] 1 see that it
invariably where 1 lacked a politic
purpose that 1 wrote lifeless book*
and was betrayed into purple P aS
sages, sentences without meaning
decorative adjectives and hum %
generally.” ,
This is a clue. “A Clergy® 2 ?*
Daughter” has all these faults,
unreal opening account of a day

When the season is good, the Railways carry to the giant
wool stores centred at Sydney, Newcastle and Goulburn, a
Golden Fleece more precious than any Jason ever sought.
For twenty-four hours in every day, on hauls averaging more
than 300 miles, it is serving the needs of this most important
of all Australian industries an indispensible link between
the man-on-the-land and his city broker.
But when drought places its dead hand upon the land, with
famine, thirst, loss and hardship following in its wake, a
lifeline of steel reaches out to bring succour to a parched
land . . . water to be carried to waterless towns . . . starving
stock to be shifted to better pastures . . . fodder to staunch
the flow of death . . .
The same railway lines that bring sustenance to a drought-
stricken land are the broad highways down which so much
of the State's primary produce passes on its journey to the
markets of the world.
Indeed, the development of primary industry in this State is one
in which the Railways has played and is continuously playing
a vital part.
That is why, in times of drought, the New South Wales
Government Railways brings relief along its lifeline of steel
not pausing in these crises to reckon in terms of profit
and loss.

THE MASK IS OFF
nrHE useful thing about the dramatics
of the U.N. Assembly meeting is
that it has brought the Communist
world to a showdown and placed it
on exhibition.
For several years what has been
developing has been concealed as
Khrushchev and Nasser and all the
world’s aspiring rebels and buccaneers
talked to each other behind their
hands.
Now, having assembled in the lime-
light, their relationships cannot be
concealed. And it must be a spectacle
to make Washington hang its head,
since the Suez affair, the last of a series
of massive American blunders, born of
inexperienced self-assurance, was the
starter for the “grab”-movement under
Russian direction which is now reach-
ing full flower.
Now it is having to fight, at a moral
disadvantage, an emboldened Com-
munist world, bent on pushing the
world-revolution and Russian conquest
to a victorious conclusion. What its
physical advantages may be remains to
be seen.
There is beyond doubt a pattern in
the events of the years since Suez, from
which the veil is only now being
stripped. The foreign elements in the
Cuban “Government,” or tyranny, or
whatever it is, tell their own story. It
is a Communist government carried on
under the guiding-hand of Guevara, an
imported Communist, with Castro as
its noisy figurehead.
Nasser, sitting quietly so far on the
fence, has played the Communist game,
gone to Russia for his finance, his ideas,
arms and technicians, while being care-
ful to play soft with the Americans,
who are his father and mother, lest he
court a slapped hand before he and his
northern allies are ready.
Nkrumah is playing a perfidious
game. He has fawned on the British,
squeezed everything he could from
them—even delayed the consumma-
tion of his republic so that his Minis-
ters and others could get a last 1 helping
of British “honors” before they turned
their backs on the West.
The Russians now have to their
debit, apart from the countries that
they have imprisoned by force behind
the barbed-wire of the Iron Curtain, a
good many revolutions which they
have helped to stir-up in the names of
anti-colonialism and “liberty.”
ThACH of these has produced the
same formula afterwards a
military tyranny frequently imple-
mented ,with lawless wholesale execu-
tions designed to intimidate, or with
the driving-out of opponents, with the
suppression of freedom of speech and
the press, or with dictatorships headed
by loud-mouthed pistol-toters like
Castro, who govern by the use of fear
and threat and violence under the
protection of the Kremlin.
Yet all of them, in terms framed in
Moscow, shout fiercely against the
“tyrannies” of the free West and the
need for the world to shake-off the
yoke of “imperialism”—which has be-
come so supine that its own press and
radio are.the chief weapons which the
Kremlin and its allies use in the cold-
war.
It is astonishing how implicitly
public opinion has been shaped to con-
form to the policies and objectives
stated clearly by the Comintern at the
conferences of the middle-19305:
In that period, as enunciated in
1939 by L. Sharkey, then and now
de facto head of the Australian
Communist party, quoting Stalin,
the Russian October Revolution
“created a powerful and open centre
of the world-revolutionary move-
ment which it had never possessed
before and around which it can now
rally and organise a united revolu-
tionary front of the proletarians and
of the oppressed nations of all coun-
tries against imperialism.”
The italics are in the original.
The Australian Communist Party
has always lauded the Stalinist admis-
sion that “by sowing the seeds of
revolution both in the centres of
imperialism and in its rear, by weaken-
ing the power of imperialism in the
‘mother countries” and undermining
its domination in the colonies, the
October Revolution has jeopardised the
very existence of world-capitalism as
a whole.”
In every country in which Com-
munism has had its foothold the same
plan has been in operation that was
laid down for the Australian Com-
munist Party by the Comintern, viz.,
that “all the industries that produce
arms for capitalist Governments, from
trousers-buttons to modern artillery:
the food industries without whU
army can move, and transport-!!?
time, railroad and motorl mu !'
penetrated and organised on tCI e
of shop and factory committees” 1^
In countries where there is M
heaven-sent propaganda mediuml!
the press of America and its ne ! I
agencies which feed and corrupt I
press of the world with falsity !
sensation, ruder methods are used „
Cuba. ’ asi |
Or, as in Ghana, where elections®
corrupt, the Opposition denied a he®
ing and its members sent to concen-
tration-camps, while its leader regaidt
—vide his autobiography, published a
year or so ago—the struggle of his little
country for independence “as part oil
a general world historical pattern”,,,
himself as a “vanguard force” whose
task is to “sweep the last vestiges of
colonialism out of Africa.”
The commission set-up some yean
ago after . disturbances at Accra to
investigate the workings of Nkrumah’s
party found that, “although modest ii
his admissions, he [Nkrumah] appear
while in Britain to have Communis
affiliations and to have become imbued
with a Communist ideology which oaf
political expedience has blurred.,,l
a working programme circulated k- jj
fore the recent disturbances we ta [
been inquiring into, Mr. Nkrumal L
boldly proposes a working programme
which is all too familiar to those who
have studied the technique of countries
which have fallen the victims of Com-
munist enslavement Mr. Nkrumal
has not really departed one jot from his
avowed aim of a Union of West African
Soviet Socialist Republics—and te
not abandoned his foreign affiliation
connected with these aims.”
AT the U.N. Assembly the mask*
now off. Many countries who*
leaders have been soft-pedalling ®
subject of the sources of their inspira-
tion are now faced frankly by Khrush-
chev and his backers with choice be-
tween openly yielding to Communis-
bloc domination of the world, throu?
the establishment of Communist wor
control in his three-member admmistr
tion of the United Nations, or taci ■
the prospect of open subversion ie
ing to violence and revolution.
It is no wonder that Mr. Me
has been provoked to the P oia
introducing a new Crimes Act an
his isolated statement concern » ,
Communism in Australia. ■,
The real marvel is that, W*
the objectives of the Communis P
for which its leadership * s usI JL e fli«

ment is so passive both in j a
keep Communist aims clearly h sub-

LAUGH, CLOWN, LAUGH!


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Forgotten Men
While the lights are on the figures of
the United Nations Assembly, the two
candidates for the United States Presi-
dency are bumbling along through the
stalest Presidential campaign within
living memory.
Even a joint debate between the two
contenders, face to face, had the appear-
ance of a contest between two lay-
preachers, though it was held in Chicago,
which usually makes a noisy setting, hard
on the temper of adversaries.
Both candidates have been walking
warily, and perhaps one of the reasons
for the advent of the Communist-Woe
leaders was to induce them to do so.
Though they are the most mobile can-
didates in history, air-services having
developed speed and versatility since the
campaign of 1956, they do not seem to
have absorbed the attention of electors
to anything like the same extent as previ-
ous candidates. Neither, despite youth
and vigor, has shown much personality
since the conventions. Their travelling
is precision-organised, their campaigning
regimented, and their equal youth a
common factor which gives them a com-
mon outlook that makes it difficult for
them to disagree politically.
Mr. Kennedy gives the impression, it
is said, of having overworked both his
voice and his frame during the tremend-
ous drive to secure nomination. He is
looked on askance by the Left-wing of
the unions, which are always the decid-
ing factor in some industrial States in
putting a Democrat into power. He has
to face the religious issue, which seems
to have put him on the defensive. And
the Kennedy millions are not a help.
On the whole, Mr. Nixon appears to
have the offensive, but he has not the
prestige, popularity or drive of President
Eisenhower. His assets are campaigning
experience and the lack of the Red back-
ground which developed in the Demo-
cratic party during the Roosevelt regime.
He has, too, an advantage in the Vice-
Presidential candidate Mr. Cabot Lodge,
who is even larger and more handsome
than Mr. Kennedy, a member of one of
the oldest (but only moderately rich)
American families.
He is known to every American with
a TV-set as the champion of the United
States in U.N. meetings, where he has
demonstrated for years a marked
capacity for making Communist -bloc
representatives look small whenever they
attack him.
He is proving, if anything, that he
might have been a better Presidential
candidate than either of the actual ones.
Mr. Kennedy’s offsider, Lyndon John-
son, is not nearly the same asset to his
chief. He smells too strongly of the
deep heart of Texas to appeal to the
olfactory nerves of a great part of the
North.
The public attitude seems to be devoid
of enthusiasm, and with not much more
than a month of real campaigning to go,
the electorate seems to feel that there is
little to choose between the candidates.
Normally the trends are pretty clear at
this stage, at least to the parties them-
selves, but this time the parties’ calcula-
tions are that there are still up to 18 per
cent, of voters undecided.
There seems to be a good chance that
the man who may win the election is a
visitor called Khrushchev, but not in the
manner he hopes. If he continues his
attacks on the Republicans and their
leadership and the Kennedy campaigners
cannot find a way of altering their line
he might easily turn the voting towards
Nixon.
At the moment the United States
seems outwardly more concerned with
Khrushchev and Castro and whether they
will succeed in leading the world than
in who is going to lead the United States
during the next four years.
"Granny" Rebukes Bob
It is not surprising that the Prime
Minister’s change-of-mind about making
a personal appearance at the U.N.
Assembly should annoy the Labor
Opposition. After all, by not going in
the first place he had robbed them of
the opportunity and pleasure of criticis-
ing him for making another overseas
trip. But worse than that, they, had
later spiked their own guns when, decid-
ing that one end of the stick was just
as good as the other so long as it was
used to hit Bob with, they criticised him
for not going. When he finally took
their advice they were rather at a loss
for effective argument.
“Sydney Morning Herald” felt no such
embarrassment. In its view, Menzies
should have gone in the first place
instead of sending Barwick, but, having
sent him, he should not have made an
eleventh-hour decision to go himself.
If that argument is sound as applied to
Menzies it should also apply to Mr.
Macmillan and New Zealand Prime
Minister Nash, neither of whom origin-
ally intended to go to New York but
who are both now there.
When the Prime Minister announced
that Sir Garfield Barwick would lead
the Australian delegation at U.N. there
was no talk of the session becoming a
Heads-of-State affair. The Barwick
appointment was announced on August
28. Khrushchev’s intention to go to
U.N. was not made public until Sep-
tember 2; his cheer-team, the Prime
Ministers of Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria,
Rumania, Albania and Czechoslovakia,
intimated in chorus the following day
that they would also attend.
At that stage there were no apparent
grounds for Australia being represented
by its Prime Minister. During the next
week there was press speculation whether
Eisenhower and Macmillan would
attend, but no decisions were made.
Barwick left Australia on September
15, and the same day it was announced
that President Eisenhower had decided
to address the Assembly. Macmillan,
asked whether he, too, would make an
appearance, said he would decide later.
His decision was not announce
September 23. In the meantime V"" 1
other Heads-of-State— Tito nL^ 1
Nasser, Fidel Castro, Indian
Minister Nehru and Canada’s
Diefenbaker had turned-up m r '
Walter Nash, of New Zealand kT?
his ticket the Commonwealth team ll8 *
almost complete, with Australia the ?
notable omission. e
Menzies’s absence in such cirj
stances would have seemed almost,
gratuitous as his attendance would u
been in the circumstances that exist!
at the time he appointed Barwick.
Adult Education
One of the chief successes of Colin
Badger as Victorian Director of Adult
Education has been to clear the mind ofa
substantial section of the public of I
esoteric and highbrow mysticism whicl
formerly surrounded ‘the arts for them
Badger, a Peterborough (S.A.) boy who
left school at 14 and was a bottle-washer
in Adelaide Uni. at 16, was befriended
by Professor Keith Hancock aid
graduated M.A. (first-class honors history,
philosophy) at 25. He spent a year study
ing the work of the Italian Old Masters
and was W.A. Director of Adult Edit
cation when he was appointed Victoria
Director of the Uni. Extension.
Since his appointment to Adult Edit
cation in 1947 he has contrived, despite
infinitesimal grants from the Govern'
ment, to take drama casts with good
plays, famous musicians and art-shows to
just on every part of Victoria.
Government education grants art
enormous, but Badger’s show has to
play second-fiddle to the pressing need
for more schoolrooms. Naturally enough
primary education comes first.
Currently he has been attending tli
Unesco conference on adult education
in Montreal with Arnold Hely, his Si
counterpart. They comprise the A»
tralian delegation, and both will sp
at the residential conference at Warbur-
ton (Vic.) on October 14, 15, 16, wW
is being conducted for —anyone i#
ested in Adult Education In A Changmg
World. That is a subject on wW
Badger, an outspoken educationist, shou
be at least interesting.

Two Canadian Commission*
Canada is acting on two matters übj
way that might commend itself tO , j
attention of the Australian f e j
Government. J
Mr. Diefenbaker has a PP?‘ n , te en ?
commissions. One is on the civil s m
which is the more commendable
it is a product of criticism w o
levelled at the service during «is P
in Opposition. ,
Opposition criticism and deman ,
inquiry rarely produce anymm! l y
the Opposition takes office,
case they have done so, and a ( ;
sion of three —a businessman, a


~ f r . en eral of the Dominion, and a
Wf Montreal lawyer—have been
vera| P®. g 0 into the details of service
nitration in order to suggest means
nme "Promote economy and recommend
Mr. ' 3 \ expenditures consistent with the
h tlls j enance of Government services and
f! liiir efficiency. .
J There have been suggestions that such
1 1 uiry might be set-up in Australia,
j. It he stock answer seems to be that the
I f of p.-s. salaries and of the actual
; w of the departments doesn’t
s( amount to more than a snippet of the
Lae Commonwealth overall expendi-
lure, Just a few millions, or tens-of-
millions, in fact.
What those who fend-off inquiry seem
,0 forget to say is that it is not what a
civil servant costs that matters so much
>1 tot what he spends, how he spends it,
lull, an( | what that spending does to help or
ft hinder the productive side of the
|bt economy.
B fhe limited probings of Professor
a Armand Bland, M.P., and his merry men
bo of the Parliamentary Committee on
iff Pablic Accounts have let a little start-
d ling daylight in on that phase of the
i question,
f A commission headed by somebody of
I the same capacity as the head of the
1 Canadian commission would do one of
two things—produce justification for
whittling-down Commonwealth expendi-
: tie or explain to somewhat mystified
leaders of the Estimates the extraordi-
i «y proliferation of first-assistant-secre-
■ toes, assistant-secretaries, deputy-secre-
taries and directors in most departments.
The second commission the Canadian
Government has appointed is directing
its efforts to the task of producing
recommendations to “contribute to the
further development of a Canadian
periodical press, consistently v/ith the free-
dom of the press.”

Premium Cars
More than half of the cars registered in
N.Z. today are more than seven years
old, and some 150,000, or one-third, are
pre-war. Many of these are uneconomic
from the point of view of parts and the
time required to keep them in reasonable
condition.
The Motor Unions are concerned be-
cause vendors of new cars demand trade-
ins at values far below their resale price.
Also, cars with low mileage are priced
higher than the new product.
In 1954 the value of motor-vehicles
imported, at £16,800,000, was 7.9 p.c. of
the total imports of £213 million. In
1955 the value rose to £21,900,000, but it
has declined since, and in 1959 the value
was £11,400,000, or 5.6 p.c. of the total
imports of £204,900,000.
Excluding trucks, the number of cars
imported has declined steadily since
1955, in spite of the increased population
and prosperity.
Approached b'y the North and South
Island Motor Unions recently, the Minis-
ter of Customs, Mr. Boord, indicated that
the amount of overseas funds available
was fully committed and any increase in
the value of motor-vehicle imports would
have to be taken from consumer goods.
The only alternative would be to dip into
reserves.
Pass Round the Hat
Those who climbed the dim flight of
steps to the Clarence Street (Sydney) attic
of the Fellowship of Australian Writers
on September 22 had an interesting
evening.
Against a dingy and solemn back-
ground, which could have served as a
setting for a secret meeting of the
Carbonari, a large and tame gathering
“met and welcomed” the two visiting
Soviet writers, Alexei Surkov (president
of the Soviet Writers’ Union) and
Madame Oksana Krugerskaya (a trans-
lator of Australian books into Russian).
One couldn’t help thinking that the
organisers were at pains to impress on the
visitors the dismal life which writers and
poets are forced to lead in capitalist
Australia. For sheer survival they are
forced to travel long miles to mow lawns
in the Caulfield Grammar School, under-
take such mean tasks as writing-up the
Myer Emporium, work on the wharves,
etc. The welcoming and farewell
speeches all had a deep whingeing note.
To stress the point, a hat was passed
round, in addition to the three-bob
collected at the door.
Madame Krugerskaya said that up to
July, 1960, 3,528,000 copies of Russian
translations of Australian authors had
been published in the U.S.S.R. ; she did
not mention any royalties.
Henry Lawson’s works sold 300,000
copies. Vance Palmer, Marcus Clarke,
Alan Marshall and Katharine Susannah
Prichard enjoyed the greatest popularity.
Some Australian prose and verse was
published in Ukrainian, Azerbajani and
Braille.
Mr. Surkov, a poet, is a good and
entertaining speaker, if also a first-rate
mob-orator and demagogue.
Some of the prize quips:
“Boris Pasternak was a good poet, but
his Dr. Zhivago was badly written”, and
was also a “blasphemous attack” of a
disinterested onlooker on “the sacred-
ness of the Soviet Revolution.” His
Nobel prize was “purely political.”
“Soviet literature has not yet thrown-
up a writer who could compare with
Tolstoy, Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoievski
or Gorky.” Surkov said that “Sholokhov
was the best living Russian writer, but
one of the nineteenth-century.”
Soviet writers “had been guilty of
accepting too much on faith.” Khrush-
chev’s denunciation of Stalin “left a
bleeding wound in Soviet hearts, a power-
ful lesson of history.”
Soviet writers “could write what, how
and when they liked.” But when it
came to getting it published “their free-
dom ended.”
Question-time was pretty dull. Surkov
gave a wobbly lectflre on “Socialist rea-
lism,” then criticised Soviet writers who
concentrated on writing spy-stories for
the children.
Finally a model of the first Sputnik
was presented to the Fellowship, probably
to remind those present “who got there
first.”
Helping Hands
Further extensions of the penal reform
and treatment of prisoners in Victoria is
forecast when the machinery proposed
in the new Social Welfare Act operates
in about six months.
The claim by the Acting Chief Secre-
tary last month that 99 per cent, of
prisoners were being returned to society
seems an exaggeration, but the latest
figures released by the Parole Board are
very impressive.
These showed that in the first two years
of the board’s operations 340 paroles
had been completed, 448 were still opera-
ting, 148 had been cancelled by re-
conviction and 32 had been cancelled.
Of 648 released in 1958-59, 126 were
under 21, 255 between 21 and 30, 181
between 31 and 40 and 86 more than 40
years.
These figures do not show a 99 per
cent, recovery-rate, but they are sub A
stantial, and even better than pro-
tagonists of prison-reform in Victoria,
whose ranks include some liberal-
minded high officials, dared to forecast.
The emphasis apparently has been on
releasing young people rather than keep-
ing them languishing in prison.
For the first two years of its opera-
tion the board, which is chaired by Mr.
Justice Barry, lately chosen as senior
Australian representative to the second
United Nations congress on crime-pre-
vention and -treatment, was hampered
by a scarcity of parole-officers who were
overloaded with work. Their success has
encouraged the Government to appoint
others.

JCriend takes a firm but friendly stand
with those hot-gospellers who try to
talk her into their religion. “I am per-
fectly happy in my own faith,” she de-
clares. “What right have you to be
happy in these troubled times?” snarled
the latest zealot before he slammed the
gate on a lost soul. —“Eke.”
“Bo”: Nothing has been more pleas-
ing to me than to find that the “weird

tralasian Post’s” poster this week —are
being practised with great enthusiasm by
savages, presumably those in Darkest
Africa. I ask but this: how the hell
did they find out that it was I who started
the practice of nibbling the navel to ward-
off the evil spirits of the V.-G.’s Dept,
and the parking-police?

“Penulis”: I join “5 G.R.” (B.
24/8/’6O) in his admiration for the
Gurkhas ; throughout the emergency in
Malaya there was no place quite so com-
fortable as the immediate vicinity of a
Gurkha battalion-h.q. I occupied a house
for nearly two years under threat of
terrorist attack ; the place was on top of
a hill whose base was circled by such a
camp—the atmosphere was one of perfect
security. But it is wrong to make the
Gurkhas responsible for the use of
Gurkhali by British officers; that was
part of the policy that made it compul-
sory for all officers of the British Colonial
Service to speak the language of the terri-
tory in which they served —and not
corruptly or pidgin-wise, either ; they had
to be fluent and competent to carry out
their daily activities without resort to
English. Promotion depended partly on
their examinations in the foreign tongue.
The gains in sympathy were immense,
and go far to explain the goodwill felt
towards Britain by ex-colonies now inde-
pendent, such as Malaya.

“Newsawk”: No doubt the eminent
cancer-experts have learned a great deal
from each other at their congress at
Melbourne University, but they can’t
teach one another not to smoke, despite
the dire warnings that issued (from
the non-smokers) during it. At afternoon-
tea time the atmosphere was blue with
the smoke of cigars, cigarettes and a few
pipes, and the reason there wasn’t any
smoking in the lecture-rooms was because
they have forbiddingly terse No Smoking
signs. Another warning by several of the
learned professors has been against such
overcooked foods as fries and grills ; but
tasty Australian grilled steak was one of
the favorite orders, and there was nary a
boiled fish, with a dessert of chewing-
gum, as a luncheon-order.

of a vibration, a throbbing roar that
creeps in the window and curls into your
consciousness and won’t let you sleep—
the air-conditioning plant on the ship
so romantically tied-up under your win-
dows. When you get to sleep at last,
you are wakened before light because
that same ship has decided to blow-off
steam. Oh, yes, it’s a wonderful posi-
tion and the view’s out of this world,

correspondence have to be numbered and
accounted-for, but carbon-paper and
stencils must be handled in the same
way. In large offices where security is
important one of the staff is made
responsible for carbon-paper, desk
blotters and the contents of wastepaper

the one who speaks English so well

just naturally has a bent for picking it
up. In 1941 on the outskirts of Beirut,
in the Lebanon, I noticed an Australian
private of engineers in charge of a

freely with them in a language which
certainly wasn’t Arabic, the major tongue

Why Murray Rose Wins
DIET FOR AN ATHLETE
By FRANK TIERNEY
A rE certain pages missing
{rom t h e orthodox
dieticians’ textbook? Is
diet an even bigger
in an athlete’s or a
swimmer’s regimen than might
be supposed?
The questions are suggested
ly the success of Murray
L in Rome’s Olympic
Games and the remarkable
of diet he did it on.
no doubt everyone
hows, he swam into first
to in the 400-metres, was
second in the 1500-metres and
fas a third-place medal-
winner in the 4 x 200-metres
relay. It brought his tally for
two Olympics (1956 and 1960)
to four gold-medals, a silver
and a bronze.
That’s not bad for a young
chap of 21—indeed he’s the
only swimmer to have chal-
lenged the supreme record of
American Johnny Weismuller,
who won five gold-medals in
two Olympics. Moreover,
tee’s a very close link
klween the pair of them.
Each of them trained on a
non-meat diet. \
There might yet be a link
of another kind. When Weis-
muller retired he became Mr.
hrzan of the films, and
Murray Rose has thoughts of
becoming a screen-star. But
back to our lettuces and bird-
seed . . .
Ever since Rose won his
wee medals at the Melbourne

Australian—
‘he average Austra-
lian athlete —is a higher-than-
average consumer of meat ; in
fact, his consumption of it is
exceeded only by that of
Argentinians and New Zea-
landers. Rose, for his part,
has never eaten meat, fish,
poultry or any meat-product
in his life.
But merely to state that
Rose is a vegetarian could be
misleading. There are special
elements in the diet helping
him to outswim his equally
well-trained rivals. His father,
Mr. lan Rose, and Mrs. Rose
have spent a fortune travel-
ling with their son to prepare
what he eats. For instance,
Mrs. Rose returned from
America in June and went to
Townsville to prepare his food
while he was in training, and
subsequently Mr. and Mrs.
Rose journeyed to Italy for the
same purpose.
Mr. Rose, in telling Austra-
lian team-manager Sid Grange
and myself about Murray’s
diet, traversed experiments and
investigations of 17 years. The
research, he said, led himself
and Mrs. Rose to believe that
the diet their son now lives
on has given him great stamina.
“It is correct,” said Mr.
Rose, “to say that in Australia
Murray is a pioneer of a
scientific food-reform move-
ment which is gaining support
and followers, particularly in
America, Britain and Europe.”
Asked why Murray pre-
ferred a non-meat diet, Mr.
Rose went back to the special
interest that he and Mrs. Rose
had taken in studying the
relationship between diet and
physical well-being.
“As a result of our studies,”
he said, “we brought Murray
up on a regime which not only
excluded meat but also
omitted many processed and
refined foods. Such foods,
made from white flour and
white sugar, form a big part
of the average Westerner’s
diet, but they do not, in our
view, contain the life-force
which real foods should have.
“Murray’s dietary regime
has been built around natural
foods. These include vege-
tables, fruits, unprocessed
cereals, honey and dairy-
products—all, wherever pos-
sible, in their natural form.
“For this reason, some
emphasis has been placed on
raw foods and a daily salad
of raw vegetables.
“We contend, as did Weis-
muller, that a primary problem
for an athlete is to avoid
acidity, because an acid-con-
dition of the blood is produc-
tive of fatigue. This poses a
problem, since any young
swimmer must have a high-
protein diet, especially during
the period immediately prior
to racing.
“Most protein foods, par-
ticularly meat, are high acid-
producers. Instead of meat,
Murray eats, as his main pro-
tein foods, such articles as
soya-beans, dairy-products and
especially millet, sesame and
sunflower-seed meal.
“Millet, for instance, is one
of the oldest and most nutriti-
ous foods known to man. It
is a completely balanced grain,
non-acid-forming, and rich in
high-grade protein, minerals,
vitamins and lecithin.”
Mr. Rose quoted the
American dietician, Lelord
Kordel: “Laboratory investi-
gations have proved that no
food is digested with as great
ease as millet. It does not
ferment in the stomach, caus-
ing digestive and intestinal
distress, as do foods and
breakfast - cereals made from
white flour and other devital-
ised grains.”
Mr. Rose added that two
other Americans, Professors
Osborn and Mendel, held the
view that millet contained a
richer store of vitamins than
any other cereal in common
use, and that it was the only
grain capable of supplying all
the vitamins needed for human
nutrition. He also quoted Dr.
John Harvey Kellog, who
declared that millet was the
only grain capable of support-
ing human life when used as
the sole item in the diet.
Experiments conducted on
the sunflower-seed and on
sesame had confirmed a simi-
lar nutritive value in other
directions for these two foods.
“Therefore,” said Mr. Rose,
“it is our view that if the
truth were known about these
three plant-foods they would
replace wheat, corn and rice
as our national cereals.
“It is perhaps not without
significance,” he said, “that the
Russians had their chefs pre-
pare a secret ‘porridge’ at the
Melbourne Olympic Games.
This ‘porridge,’ in our opinion,
contained the cereals we have
discussed, because their value
is known in Russia.”
Referring to Murray Rose’s
pre-competition training, Mr.
Rose said it had been found
that the ideal was a high-
protein diet until about a week
before a major period of
racing: “He is then changed
to a diet which is high in
carbohydrates and sugars. This
diet produces maximum
energy.
“Sugar, as everyone knows,
is important as a producer of
fuel. But the refined white
sugar which most people eat
has had the valuable minerals
and vitamins removed, and is
practically useless. Taken
liberally, in the way many
athletes take it, it is positively
harmful.
“So Murray has substituted
for white sugar and candy the
concentrated natural sugars
found in dried-fruits, such as
dates, raisins, figs, etc. When-
ever sweetening is required he
has honey or dark-brown
unrefined sugar.
“As sugar is stored in the
body in a form of glycogen
for many months, Murray
drinks a daily pint of freshly
squeezed carrot-juice for its
sugar and other valuable con-
tents. He also takes a pint
of fresh-pineapple juice.
“Like most athletes who
reach world-standard he eats
plenty of honey. We have
found honey one of the best
energy-producers of all. It is
99 per cent, predigested dex-
trose, and its energy-value is
rapidly available.”
Mr. Rose further explained
that Murray supplemented this
diet.
“We regard the most neces-
sary supplement as vitamin-E,”
he said. “Murray takes large
doses of this vitamin in tablet-
or powder-form.
“The importance of vitamin-
E in the diet of the athlete
does not seem to be properly
understood. Its effect is to
increase the blood-supply to
the heart and to decrease the
oxygen-requirements of the
muscle.
“Thus it helps the athlete

POLITICAL POINTS
At the United Nations Assembly the
outstanding features of the week
were Harold Macmillan’s address,
punctuated by violent outbursts and
desk-thumping by Khrushchev, Mr. K.’s
renewed attack on Secretary-General
Hammarskjold and an appeal by Nehru,
Nasser, Tito, Soekarno and Nkrumah for
an Eisenhower-Khrushchev meeting.
The British Prime Minister’s speech, as
glimpsed on TV, seemed a forceful and
sincere effort which probably gained in
effect rather than lost from the antics of
the Russian Premier.
• •
Macmillan was able to surmount
Khrushchev’s shouting and desk-thump-
ing with the typical urbanity of the
English Public School man—but there
was probably more to it than that. Under
the British Parliamentary system a poli-
tical leader is conditioned to taking
interjections and interruptions in his
stride. In what passes for a Parliament in
Moscow Khrushchev has probably never
heard a hostile interjection. He certainly
never did any table-thumping himself
when Stalin was boss.
• •
Heffron gave caucus a thorough
talking-to on the heinous offence of
“leaking” caucus discussions to the press
or public. The words “treachery” and
“traitors” were hurled around and there
were threats of expulsion from the party
for any who offended. And next day’s
papers carried a complete report!

Today (Wednesday) the white citizens
of South Africa will vote in a referendum
which asks them whether or not they
want their country to be a republic.
Prime Minister Verwoerd’s Nationalist
party urges them to vote “Yes”; the
Opposition (United party led by Sir de
Villiers Graaff) says “No.” If the argu-
ment was a straight-out contest between
voters of Boer descent and those of
British extraction it would be all over
bar the counting. The critical question
is whether all those who vote for Ver-
woerd’s party at general elections are
prepared, as he is, to “go it alone,” and
whether many U.P. voters switch on this
issue.
At the last general election the
Nationalists polled 647,468 votes and the
United party 503,635 ; Independents and
others scored 10,298. The figures aren’t
an accurate guide to the voting strength
of the parties, as 24 United-party candi-
dates were returned unopposed. Both
sides claimed that if all seats had been
contested they would have scored a
majority of aggregate votes.

Soekarno protested in the U.N.
Assembly that West New Guinea was “a
colonial sword poised over Indonesia,
pointing at our heart.” The oft-repeated
Soekarno charge that Holland plans to
use West New Guinea as a base from
which to attack Indonesia is ludicrous.
The gravest danger posed in New Guinea
is not that the Dutch will invade Indo-
nesia, but that they will leave New
Guinea before the local people are ready
to run the country themselves.

[From Canberra]
Legislation to give natives in Papua and
New Guinea limited rights of electing native
members to the Legislative Council was nicely
timed.
With the U.N. debate on the trusteeship of
territories imminent, the legislation will p
Menzies some good ammuniiton to use against
expected criticisms of Australia’s administration
and plans for ultimate self-government.
He’ll be able to tell the critics that in future
the elected membership of the council, includ-
ing natives, will have a majority of eight over
the civil-service appointees. This will mean
that the elected members will have the numbers
to force voting, instead of merely being a
voice in the wilderness.
M.P.s were agreeably surprised at the con-
tents of the bill as disclosed by Territories
Minister Paul Hasluck. It will take a lot of
wind out of the sails of the Opposition, who
have never been hesitant to have a crack at
the Government (and Hasluck particularly)
over the handling of affairs in New Guinea.
The Labor party will find itself hard-put
to oppose the legislation, which advances®
programme of self-government immeasurably

John Howse’s resignation from the

expected for some weeks, was announced
last Thursday, by which time three of
the four parties had chosen their candi-

for the endorsement. There were five in
the field for the.C.P. nomination ; it went
to another grazier, John England, of
Wilga, near Grenfell. The Labor candi-
date is L. Serisier, an Orange solicitor.

Although the Institute of Public Affairs
Victoria does not claim that these results
of a survey of Australian living-standards
over the last decade are the last word
on the subject, they are approximately
correct: There has been a substantial
advance in living standards; weekly
expenditure of an average family of four
has increased 15 per cent, from £2B ‘Bs.
to £32 10s. ; wage-earners, many busi-
nessmen and investors are better off;
fixed-income receivers, many professional
and salaried people and fanners may be
no better off and may have even lost
ground.
About half the increased expenditure
has been on houses, cars and durable
goods financed on terms ; expenditure on
food and clothing is smaller; as incomes
rise, less proportionately is spent on basic
necessities and a greater proportion on
comforts and luxuries. Real wages,
including overtime and over-award pay-
ments, increased by 23 per cent, between
1948 and 1959-60.

Max Ragless, the South Australian
artist, dropped into The Bulletin office
in Sydney to talk to other connoisseurs
of the Birdsville Track, having just
returned from his second painting-trip
to that choice area. This time he
branched-off into the Strezlecki Track,
which is a channel of Cooper’s Creek
BIRDSVILLE TRACK
best used, naturally, when the Cooper is
not running—and found it extremely
uninteresting. However, he was pleased
to recall that the Strezlecki was the origi-
nal Birdsville Track and that intrepid
shearers rode their bikes down it from
Queensland to S.A. in the ’nineties. Rag-
less’s paintings from the desert country,
which have included some unusual
glimpses of the mirage, have been popu-
lar both with the National Galleries and
the public, and one of them won the H.
C. Richards Prize in Brisbane. He is a
self-taught artist, well-known in both
oils and watercolors, and was born on
the land near Adelaide. At one time he
ran his own vineyard, but gave it away
for fulltime painting.

ABORIGINALITIES
■Oeference here to the term “wowser”
reminded me of Old Poohbah,
who bossed our back-country town in the
very early 1920’5. The R.S.L. was then in
its swaddling-clothes. Among the hand-
ful of returned men Old Poohbah was
the only one who publicly and privately
shunned the Demon Rum. We precocious
kids knew that Old Poohbah had a good
record in the Boer War and in-1914-18 ;
but he was a wowser, so, for his benefit
we sang, always in his hearing, a then-
current and ribald ditty commencing with
“If you mingle with the wowsers, by the
buttons on your trousers,” etc. Then a
drifter drifted-in, from nowhere, miracul-
ously drunk on arrival. He jabbered
words which 20 years later I found to be
Arabic. The drifter got drunker, with
mouthings and gesticulations which
amused us kids till Old Poohbah arrived
to kick the nearest juvenile behinds. At
♦I, a r j t
the Anzac ceremony a few days later the
Si; r er -, and wearing ,b oL ft 01d
Poohbah s suits, was on the platform.
Old Poohbah died a few years afterwards;
the drifter stayed to become mayor of
the town, farewell and welcome back
quite a few of the larrikin kids of 1921
who went overseas in 1939-45, and, until
he answered his last roll-call a year or
so back, to attribute, on every platform,
his regeneration to Old Poohbah, the
wowser. „ I don’t like the word. —

bheritt : Staying in Townsville (Q.) I
was out late several mornings in a row ;
what struck me was the schedule the
city dogs and roosters follow in their
nocturnal noise-making. The roosters
had always started the dogs, or vice versa,
so I had always thought. In Townsville,
though, the roosters had a little session
around about midnight, while the dogs
either slept or listened. Then, after an
hour or so of quiet, the dogs started-up,
and were allowed an uninterrupted go
for almost two hours. From about 4 a.m.
the chooks carried-on and no dogs were
heard until about the rising-time of
their owners. Is this peculiar to Towns-
ville?

Guinea are sent to Sydney by sea and
forwarded to Mr. Worrall to be “milked”
of their venom ; but as the voyage, with
attendant delays, may take a month or
more the snakes on arrival are either
in very poor condition or very dead. Thus
the small amount of life-saving anti-
venine produced is inadequate and very
expensive. Importation of snakes by

dispensation could not be granted, espe-
cially as his “snakery” is itself quaran-

there would be no difficulty if many of
the Papuan black’s victims were white

majority are natives he found that little
interest could be aroused on their behalf.
If it’s true that nothing but a little red-

of snakebite victims—only anti-venine
from the same species is effective —then
surely this is a case for applying that
basic tenet of the medical profession:

TN the group of lie-swappers waiting

morose and monosyllabic. His grievance
wasn’t his sheep dying of worms despite
fortnightly drenching, nor the sparseness
of his oat-crop (“reminds me of the
moustache I grew when I was thirteen”),
but the impossibility of destroying rab-
bit-harbor on the scrubby, boulder-
dotted granite-block where he battles to
make a living. As he says, he could
blow the whole property sky-high with
gelignite, and the rabbits would be
burrowing in the rubble before the dust
had settled ; yet, as the law stands, he’s
liable to be fined or jailed if the inspector
finds one rabbit on the place and Johnno
not, on that particular day, engaged in
suppressing it. As he’s bad friends with
our present inspector, that official isn’t
disposed to be lenient, and we could
see his latest fine was rankling with old

subject is confusing. E. Phillips Fox, in

the background. T. A. Gilfillan, in his

White Ensign of the Royal Navy behind
the central group, with the Union Flag
flying from a headland to the left of

is depicted. The Picturesque Atlas of

duced Gilfillan’s painting as a wood-
engraving, but made the mistake of show-
ing the Union Flag as it was from IP

when the banner of St. Patrick was
added. This engraving was further repro-

HASTINGS DEERING
FINANCE & INVESTMENT CO. LTD.
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS TO SHAREHOLDERS
jddress of the Chairman, Mr. H. Hastings Deering, to the Tenth Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders held in Sydney on 30th September, 1960.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is with pleasure that I have to present to you the
record of another successful year in our Company’s business.
The steady progress of our Company’s work is reflected
in an increase of 47% in business transacted this year
with consequent in-built prosperity. While this can be regarded
as good progress, it is but a step in the development con-
fronting the Company. Our resources and opportunities are
expanding.
In the history of the Company since its formation there
has never been a time when the prospect was so bright for
our financing operations as now, when the Ford Falcon car
has been introduced to the Australian market, an increased
range of Caterpillar diesel tractors is being handled, and there
is a high level of demand for A.E.C. trucks and buses and
other valuable products for which our associated companies
hold franchises. Any one of these developments would
ordinarily be considered a distinct advantage in the field of
finance in which our Company has been specially engaged.
Coming concurrently, they add up to a very impressive prospect
for the future.
Our business is soundly based. The products we finance
go hand in hand with our national development; cars, com-
mercial vehicles, heavy duty trucks and buses, agricultural
tractors and equipment and earth-moving machines. And the
franchises we service for our associated companies are world
famous in their respective spheres. Ford, Caterpillar, A.E.C.,
Hyster, John Deere, Lister can each claim to be world leaders
in their line. The quality of this business is all first class, and
'is growth in volume is well expressed in the increase of 47%
recorded in the past year.
In consequence, our net profit has again improved and
the amount of £90,107 disclosed in the accounts permits
Payment of a 10% dividend plus increases of £lO,OOO in our
General Reserve and of £2,811 in carry forward.
Additional resources became available progressively to
n ance this increased business. The Company’s interest rates
and conditions of acceptance of term deposits met with a
gratitying response in that deposits increased during the year
rom £640,270 to £1,445,226 —an increase of 125%. The
at 30th June, 1960, for each £lOO of deposits

e a good response to our prospectus.
Th
P r osperifv S f ttin f in which we ourselves now is one of
of the lor Aust ralia. Conditions are buoyant in all sectors
°nomy. Production is high, investment is active, and
obviously we are in a cycle of development that will take us
up to greater peaks of national performance. To the extent
that Australia grows, so must the operations of our Company
expand in financing the purchase of goods and implements
that will quicken the country’s development and make more
fluid its transport.
The Hastings Deering group of companies already has
a turnover in excess of £11,000,000 a year. The future turn-
over should be considerably enhanced with the advent of the
Ford Falcon car which in itself is a notable event in the
industrial, commercial and economic life of Australia.
JThe Hastings Deering group is the largest Ford dealer
in Australia and through its organisation and careful planning
for the extension of sales and service in Greater Sydney, is
in a position to take full advantage of the yield to be expected
from its long established Ford franchise.
Besides financing the purchase of Ford vehicles, the
Company has financed a considerable amount of equipment
to contractors for the Snowy Mountains project and other
public works.
In Queensland, the Northern Territory and New Guinea,
where our associate companies hold the valuable Caterpillar
franchise, major projects are under way in mineral develop-
ment and the search for oil, the large-scale clearing of
brigalow lands for settlement in Queensland, the building
of a network of western cattle roads, and reconstruction of
the Mount Isa-Townsville railway at an estimated cost of
£29-million. This last mentioned work is one of magnitude,
and contractors for the first sections are planning to begin
the laying of tracks in the second week in January, 1961.
These are some of the many indications of Australia’s
developmental growth in a time of sustained prosperity. There
is ample support for the confidence with which we can look
towards the present and future years, knowing that the service
we are supplying is linked with the “national drive” and that
as a Company we are geared to contribute to, as well as to
share in, the making of a still more prosperous Australia.
A form of finance now in operation on a wide scale
throughout Australia is the financing of properties. One of
our new activities will be this type of business directed mainly
to the Sydney Metropolitan area, where more than one
quarter of Australia’s entire population lives. High density of
population is a favourable factor in the economic operation
of a property financing service of the kind this Company is
able, with its knowledge and its growing resources, to provide.
It remains for us to address ourselves energetically to
the opportunities before us, and I am sure that in my
determination to do this with all vigour in the coming year
I have your wholehearted co-operation and support.
Our Company is well served by a loyal and competent
staff to whose faithfulness and efficiency I again pay tribute.
The economy of our administration is such that increased
business can be serviced with the minimum of additional
expense. I therefore look forward to the future with confidence
that we shall be able to continue to earn satisfactory profits.
I have pleasure in moving the reception and adoption
of the reports and accounts for the year ended 30th June,
1960, as printed, and will ask Mr. Rowe to second the motion.

ABSORBING COSTS
VIfARNiNGs that rising costs
(mainly labor costs, such
as the recent margins-increases)
could not for ever be absorbed
by the proprietary side of
industry have come from two
sources recently.
The directors of Wormald
Bros, have told shareholders
that the co. has so far absorbed
a good deal of the impact of
inflation, but there was a limit
to the capacity of any company
to absorb such increases, and
a continuance of inflationary
trends would inevitably bring
sharp rises in prices.
Chairman J. A. Forrest, of
Australian Consolidated Indus-
tries, told his shareholders at
the annual meeting that it was
a fallacy to think that increased
costs could continue to be
absorbed indefinitely, or passed
on, without seriously impairing
the capacity of industry to
compete, locally or abroad.
A.C.I. had been able to hold
down the selling-prices of its
main products through a com-
bination of increased turnover
and higher productivity.
Against these comments it
is interesting to have the ob-
servations of the Reserve Bank
governor, Dr. H. C. Coombs,
in his annual report:
In view of the increase in the
basic-wage and margins, some
increase in prices was probably
unavoidable, but it is disappointing
that the increase was greater ’ than
in either of the two preceding
years.
Regrettably, many sections of the
community are still accepting con-
tinued price-increases as inevitable,
and instead of resisting inflation are
looking about for new wqys of
protecting themselves from its
effects. At the same time, new
institutional facilities are encourag-
ing the belief that protection from
inflation is in fact possible. There
is a very real danger, however,
that in their attempt to protect
themselves, they will only aggravate
the price-rises.
There is no doubt that rising
prices are undesirable. Apart from
the unnecessary hardship imposed
on those sections of the community
who cannot pass on cost-increases,
they cause serious economic dis-
tortions and waste of resources.
It is not enough, however, to
avoid as far as possible any price-
increases in individual commodities.
If prices overall are not to rise,
the prices of goods from industries
whose productivity is increasing
rapidly must fall, to permit some
increases in goods and services
where the opportunity for produc-
tivity growth is much smaller, or
where costs are rising from exter-
nal causes. It is only in this way
that the fruits of economic progress
can be equitably shared.
The comments of the bank
governor, however justified in
general, are generalisations,
and it seems necessary to em-
phasise that, while margins for
skill in wage-rates are essential
to encourage increased produc-
tivity from each employed per-
son, a general increase in real
wages is not desirable every
time it looks as though some
increased productivity has been
achieved by industry as a
whole. More and more of the
fruits of increased productivity
should go back to the spot
where it originated—which was
in the outlay of ploughed-back
profits on modern capital-
equipment.
Therefore it is unreasonable
to expect industry to absorb
the burden of growing arbitra-
tion-court wages in cases where
they may have been unrealis-
tically awarded when set
against the capacity of industry
to pay for them and at the same
time provide for capital-replace-
ment and compete on local or
overseas markets.
The boom in share prices on
the Stock Exchanges has had
no relationship whatsoever with
company profits and dividends.
Shares have risen largely be-
cause of fears of further infla-
tion and because of an influx
of capital from the trouble-
spots of the world. In respect
of the dividend-income they
receive, most shareholders have
lost ground over the past
decade —quite differently from
the experience of the wage-
earner.
Many shareholders hang-on
to their scrip in hopes of pie
in the sky by-and-by. But
many of the companies in
which they are shareholders
are really scratching when it
comes to a matter of financing
new plant or replacing old.
Very few companies indeed are
free of the menace of capital-
erosion, and to ask them to
absorb wage-rises that have
very little justifiable economic
basis is a bit thick.
A Weakening Sharemarket
A fter touching a new record
peak for the year, when
B.H.P. shares, cum rights to the
bonus-issue, hit £5, there has
been a widespread weakening
in share prices (with B.H.P.
down to 935. 6d.).
A setback to recent pro-
longed buoyancy was overdue.
To put it in the tersest possible
way, investors seemed to be
banking on other investors
being prepared to accept still
lower yields than 2 p.c. on
favored stocks, since it was
quite clear from their financial
finessing that many company
managements were not likely to
pay suitably rewarding divi-
dends for years to come, and
were very interested in keeping
their shareholders happy
through market-appreciation.
For two or three years com-
pany turnovers and profits have
by no means kept pace with the
rises in prices of most shares,
and the result has been that not
only have yields from dividends
been slashed heavily, but earn-
ings-yield to market-price has
been similarly chopped.
It has been apparent from
any analysis that the share-
market boom was not based on
current earnings of the com-
panies concerned, nor upon
any likelihood of an early lift
in earnings to the point where
dividends themselves would
justify the payment of recent
soaring sharemarket prices.
Investors and speculators
have been paying for pie in the
sky, and banking on an inflow
of overseas funds' to keep the
Australian sharemarket bub-
bling buoyantly.
But it is always dangerous to
count on finding a bigger
sucker than yourself any time
you want to. He just isn’t
there when the pressure is on.
It is unlikely that the present
setback will bring an end to the
prevailing boom which sur-
rounds the sharemarket. But it

in . a 1 the true Picture
or the Australian economy is ’
one in which there are definite

expansion. And there has
been a past trend towards
irresponsibility in- bidding-up

of their earning-power or divi-
dend-yield.
One of the fundamental fac- !
tors which must be considered, i
long-term, is whether present
Treasury policy in respect of
taxation and arbitration-court
policy in regard to wages and
hours will ever allow profit-

Sydney ’Change Moves
Eive months ahead of
A schedule, Sydney Stock
Exchange has moved into
bigger, modern premises in the
brand-new 18 - story Royal
Exchange Assurance Building,
which extends through a city
block from Bligh Street to
O’Connell Street with en-
trances from both sides.
The ’Change is taking-up the
lower five floors, but some of
this space has been reserved for
future expansion and is being
temporarily sub-let.
The trading - floor covers
5000 sq.-feet. There are 600
sq.-feet of chalk-boards in
double-height section and an-
other 600 1 sq.-feet in single-
height section. Individual
acoustically - lined telephone-
boxes for all members are
located on the trading-floor,
which has been designed for
post-trading. There are separ-
ate call-rooms for Government
securities.
The press is provided with a
well-appointed gallery above
the trading-floor with tele-
phones, etc. A public gallery
adjoins the press quarters. On
the same floor are the chair-
man’s and the secretary’s
offices and the board-room.
The Research and Statistical
Bureau has a double-height
window-frontage at the Bligh
Street entrance.
Other facilities include a
printing-house with fast new
machinery, transfer - marking
service, radio-broadcast room,
private automatic branch tele-
phone - exchange and staff
amenities.
The hall is lined with Aus-
tralian white marble and im-
ported Italian mosaics.
Viscount Holdings, Ltd.
"Emphasis is put on two main
points in the prospectus of
Viscount Holdings, Ltd. One
is the tourist and industrial
potential of the strategically
situated Albury (N.S.W.) dis-
trict in the prevailing surge of
economic expansion in Aus-
tralia. The other is the oppor-
tunities offering in the motel
and associated businesses at the
present time.
However, the plans of the
co. do not stop at motels or
at the Albury district. One of
the most interesting activities
of the co. will be its linen-hire
service. Sheets, towels, pillow-
slips and the like will be hired
through approved launderers to
hotels and motels, thus saving
heavy initial capital-cost of
linen to motelkeepers and the
like. Experience in the U.S.A.
shows linen-hiring to be a pro-
fitable business. Distribution-
points are being established in
all Australian capitals.
The co. has definite plans
about the establishment or
acquisition of an engineering-
works in the Albury district,
with eyes on Snowy Mountains
contracts as well as local work.
Capital-outlay on this is put at
£50,000, which is the same
figure as for the linen-hiring
service.
Most of the initial capital is
earmarked for a 40-unit motel
at Albury, on the Hume High-
way, near the railway-station.
For this £134,000 has been set
aside. A long option over
adjoining land has been
obtained.
It is intended to build a first-
class motel with all amenities,
a survey in the U.S.A. having
shown that the better-type
motels have a higher and more
permanent earning-power. This
is important, in view of a
tendency by some promoters to
rush-up motels more as a
short-term spec, than a long-
term investment.
These activities represent the
first stages of the co.’s opera-
tions. Other motels and other
activities are foreshadowed,
including the building of home-
units at Albury.
A public issue of 915,993
ords. of ss. each is being made,
payable in full on application ;
4007 subscribers’ shares have
already been issued; and
80,000 are reserved for vendors.
The public issue has been
underwritten by Hattersley and
Maxwell and Ralph W. King
and Yuill.
On the proposed capital of
£250,000, estimated net profit,
after tax, is put at £30,900,
equal to 12.4 p.c. on capital,
and is expected to be ample to
cover an 8 p.c. div.
There is no payment for
goodwill or intangibles. The
sum of £36,500 (£lO,OOO of it
in shares) is payable for pro-
perty being acquired.

iifye pleasure of His
Company”
In Sydney Royal’s new show
lie gimmick necessary to all
Broadway successes falls be-
l»een the average good father
of the Penny Pringle strip and
He wicked stepfather of Lolita :
he is a divorced playboy father
who comes to take his daughter
' on a world-tour just as she is
about to be married next Satur-
day.
Cyril Ritchard makes an
urbane portrait of the ageing
playboy used to getting his own
way, either with charm or by
other means. He settles himself
r uninvited in the study of his
i (wife’s new husband in their
1 borne in San Francisco ; in a
j tort while he engineers a
fnarrel between his daughter
aid her young rancher fiance ;
and then, making love after
midnight to his ex-wife, is dis-
covered by her new husband.
At all points he has perfected
this well-known English type—
nodoubt from constant obser-
vation— from its cheery way of
walking over objecting faces to
'! s C °W stiffening when objec-
tions become threats.
It is something to say that
has almost as fine a finish
as Cornelia Otis Skinner, who
Ws the divorced wife and
r , such finesse, within the
mts of this quiet play,
esents the woman who has
K* c °ntent to round-out
h e as a club-woman but
iu l not fi u ‘ te sure > under
C L r 3 ter y °f her ex-husband’s
m a nd the memories of
their life together, whether she
is content or merely resigned.
Her woe and indignation when
she sees her ex-husband giving
her daughter the necklace of
emeralds he gave her, herself
(and every other wife he has
had), and always took back
again, is about the best bit of
comedy in the play.
As the daughter, Patricia
Kerr mixed innocence, anguish
“ Giovanni’s inspired again !”
and gaiety very creditably;
Kevin Colson made a
properly angry young bull-
breeder menaced with the loss
of his love ; Owen Ainley was
a comic old author with ad-
vanced theories about sex and
an increasing hope that sex
isn’t everything, who thinks his
granddaughter should be
allowed to see the world before
getting married; Grant Taylor
played the second husband with
well-restrained irritation; and
Edward Howell, as a San Fran-
cisco Chinese, let people in and
out when he happened to be
around.
Altogether, it is a smooth
play of middle-age, where
nothing that happens is more
important than that it should
go on happening; just as, in
the purring satisfaction of the
first - night Sydney audience
welcoming back one of its
world - famous actors, the
pleasure of Mr. Ritchard’s com-
pany was mixed with the
pleasure of still being alive to
see him after all these years.

“She Stoops to Conquer”
Judging from the relative
number of performances the
two plays have received in
recent years, “The Rivals” is
more popular than “She Stoops
to Conquer.” This is a pity,
because Goldsmith’s play is
clearly the better. His satire is
more subtle than Sheridan’s;
he has created characters where
Sheridan has provided carica-
tures ; and his plot needs far
less bolstering from fortuitous
circumstance.
It may well be, of course, that
this is only a 'matter of per-
sonal taste and that the extrava-
gance of “The Rivals” is the
essence of its success. Certainly
that is the quality which has
been seized upon by producers
as the impulse for the richly
stylised productions we have
become accustomed to.
The same formula, however,
does not hold with Goldsmith’s
play, and in the Melbourne
Union Theatre Repertory Com-
pany’s production this seems
to have been only half-realised.
Both the acting and the flow
of the play itself reveal here an
unfortunate conflict between
the declamatory and naturalis-
tic styles which mars an other-
wise excellent rendering of the
play.
Producer George Ogilvie has
approached his task with much
imagination and, particularly
in the minor parts, he has firmly
established characters whose
delightful ugliness and postur-
ing recall a Hogarth drawing.
The two most impressive
performances were given by
Malcolm Phillips in the famous
role of Mr. Hardcastle and by
Janne Coghlan as Kate Hard-
castle. Dfennis Miller makes
the most of a distinctly limited
role; Joan Harris gives her
usual dependable performance ;
Mary Hardy and Frederick
Parslow are also responsible
for some fine work, although
both offend now and then with
their tendency to belittle certain
aspects of their roles.

Winifred Atwell
Having shed some 701 b. of
surplus avoirdupois since she
was here last, the West Indian
pianist, almost sylph-like and
practically unrecognisable from
what she was, gave quick re-
assurance to her audience at
her opening Sydney Town
Hall concert last week that
neither her own special brand
of slick-fingered pianism nor
her sparkling personality had
suffered any corollary reduc-
ing. Quite the reverse, in
fact; extra physical vigor
seemed to give her fingers even
greater speed and control, and
her personality an added
value.
To show that there’s a
serious side to her music-
making, Miss Atwell dropped
into her programme thematic
snippets from Grieg’s Piano
Concerto and made a true
night-piece of Debussy’s “Clair
de Lune.” For the rest it was
syncopation all the way, with
a spot of off-beat jazz vying
with the conventional —and

Out of the Pocket
The director of Sydney’s
Pocket Playhouse, Norman
McVicker, has announced a
“three-stage plan” for expan-
sion of his theatre’s activities.
The company, he said, has
bought the present Playhouse
building and will close it after
the next production for “exten-
sive alterations,” including en-
largement of seating-capacity
and repositioning of the stage.
The company is also negotiat-
ing for the long-term lease of a
piece of land close to its present
location where it intends to
build a new little-theatre “seat-
ing between 150 and 200 for the
staging of major productions.”
This done, the present theatre
would be used for children’s
productions and workshop
activities, “At this stage,” Mc-
Vicker added, “the production
of Australian plays will be
undertaken by the workshop
group on a basis previously
unknown in Australian theatre.
Playwrights will be invited to
work with the workshop group
on their plays during tryout
performances. Worth - while
plays will then be transferred
to the new theatre for a regular
season.”
The project is to be financed
partly from present funds and
donations, partly by loan and
partly from a building-fund
which “provides for the pur-
chase of ‘bricks’ in the new
theatre at 2s. a unit.”
“As in the past,” McVicker
concluded, “the Pocket Play-
house will continue as a non-
profit-making organisation, all
work being done on a voluntary
basis.”
Artbursts
Gleghorn
It is extremely doubtful
whether, without the titles in
the catalogue, Thomas Gleg-
horn’s large black-and-white
abstracts at Sydney Macquarie
Galleries would evoke any feel-
ing of the Australian landscape.
Despite such titles as “Tropic
of Capricorn” and “Inland
Summer” they evoke, if any-
thing, recollections of wheels
and pistons and this artist’s
development from engineering.
But they are best regarded
simply as abstracts, not evoking
anything except what firm line
and bold black shapes may
evoke ; and as such they are
interesting enough, but essenti-
ally facile. Gleghorn’s most
rewarding departure in this
show is in the use of soft color
and gentler, more intimate
drawing in such pieces as
“Wheogo,” “Claypans” and
“Night Piece,” the last of which
has something of the soft
coloring of the reproductions
of aboriginal cave-paintings.
These paintings do, distantly,
evoke the landscape, and they
are pleasing in themselves.
Gleghorn has also been ex-
perimenting with the flat sculp-
ture of the bas-relief in small
designs of metal ; and if most
of these would need to be
brought up much larger before
one could decide to what extent
their monumentaiity offsets
their elementary mathematics,
at any rate “Captive Tribe,”
consisting of stylised metal
figures—which might have
come either from Henry Moore
or from the aboriginal “run-
ning women”—-s uspended
against a copper tray, is a
delightful little piece of work.
Melbourne Art
Samuel Byrne did not start
to paint until he was 66, in
the year he retired from the
job he had held since the age
of 15 —in a Broken Hill silver-
mine. Today he is 75, and
his first one-man show is cur-
rently on view at Melbourne’s
Museum of Modern Art.
Byrne has been called an
“elderly primitive,” and the
description seems apt enough,
though it must be added that
he owes not a little to other
primitives, notably Rousseau.
Like most painters without
formal training or long years
of cultivation behind them,
Byrne’s artistic ends are as
naive as his means. Detail
fascinates him. He refuses to
discriminate between what we
would normally consider the
relevant and the irrelevant.
He attempts to include every-
thing in a series of loving and
painstaking panoramic views
of the Silver City and else-
where, with the result that the
sense of the whole is often
missing ; we get the trees, but
the wood eludes us.
Nevertheless there is some
binding quality here, some
overall, integrating design—
like that we find in old, intri-
cately illustrated maps—and it
is from this that Byrne’s work
derives its poetry and power.
Most memorable of his paint-
ings are “Bobbin Head,”
“Flood Wrecked Bridge” and
“The Bushman’s Lone Grave.”
Gil Jamieson (also at the
Modern Art Museum) makes-
up for a coarse and erratic
technique with the strength of
his intentions and a real feel-
ing for the dramatic potential
of color. His subject is Aus-
tralian outback life, and he
seems to be striving for
descriptions of it that are
more literal than painterly.
Thus his work is often merely
illustrative, but it has these
other qualities—particularly in
such paintings as “Scrub
Dodgers at the Three Moon”
and “Burning Old Scrub”—
which must command our
respect.
John Stringer (Argus Gal-
lery) seems out to please rather
than enlighten: his painting is
marred by an odd impression
of “catering for all tastes”;
but perhaps this is because,
still a young man, he has not
yet been able to decide what
his artistic objectives should
be. And this could be a good
thing. The simple etchings and
drypoints reveal his unques-
tionable talents in a more
positive and assured aspect.

Also at the V.A.S, Bernard
Lawson does best when he
attempts least, as in his group
and single-figure studies. His
paintings this time are an un-
expected disappointment.
Lindsay Edwards, at Gallery
A, presents us with a series of
images of man. But it is man
in essence, deprived of the
familiar and reassuring exter-
nals. Each painting has an
individual force, though only a
vague, generalised and not-
easily-definable meaning. The

simplicity and boldness. A new
element enters Edwards’s art
when he turns’ to gouaches.
Here we find a warmth and in-
vention of design which con-
trasts oddly with his other
work. It is an exhibition which
is at once both difficult to enjoy
and hard to forget.
In David Armfield’s show at
the Australian Galleries the
appeal of his unpretentious
landscapes is immediate: there
is little challenge to anything
other than the eye. Armfield’s
conception of the Australian
scene is romantically tinged,
but unsentimental. When he
finds it necessary to enter sub-
jectively into the colors and
contours of what he is painting
he reveals a talent for simple
stylisation rare among Austra-
lian landscapists. This reviewer
was particularly impressed by
“Winter Landscape,” “Coota-
mundras,” and “Hillside at
Eltham.”
Drysdale
A retrospective exhibition of
paintings by Russell Drysdale
opens today (Wednesday) at the
N. S. Wales Gallery. It will be
reviewed on this page next
week, but in the meantime
should need no recommenda-
tion, for it is certain to be of
outstanding interest.

“Conspiracy of Hearts”
This Rank Organisation film
has warmth of feeling, com-
passion for the plight of
wretched children left as flot-
sam by the receding tide of
war, and gentle touches of
humor to offset its grimmer
episodes as it traces the deter-
mination by some nuns in a
convent in Italy, during the
steady Nazi withdrawal up the
peninsula, to save from a near-
by concentration-camp some
Jewish children whose fate they
have good cause to fear for.
They are helped by Partisans,
and the sequences in which
these are involved generate
some well-guided excitement.
The film gains considerably
from a sterling performance by
Lilli Palmer as the serene and
worldly-wise Mother Superior
who matches her wits and a
native shrewdness against those
of the Nazi commander (played
with a too-oily smoothness by
Albert Levan). Peter Arne’s
brutal lieutenant cuts away only
lightly from the stereotyped.

“Man on a String”
A running commentary pur-
porting to spill some of the
methods used by agents of the
U.S. Central Bureau of Intelli-
gence lends a semi-document-
ary air to this film, based on
Boris Morros’s Ten Years as
a Counter-spy, about a Russian-
born American film-producer
who has made himself useful
to Russian spies in the U.S. in
the hope of getting his father
and brothers out of Russia.
Offered by the C. 8.1. the
choice of jail or becoming a
counter-spy, he agrees to co-
operate, and when he learns
from his expatriate father that
his brothers were murdered by
the Communists he gets some
grim satisfaction from his first
assignment.
From then on, until his
escape from East to West Ber-
lin after having wrested vital
information from the Russians,
who have trusted him till they
get a tip-off, suspense is kept at
concert-pitch tautness.
Ernest Borgnine brings his
own brand of vitality to the
role of the man walking a
tightrope of double-espionage,
and he is strongly supported by
Kerwin Mathews, as one of the
guiding brains of the C. 8.1.,
and Vladimir Sokolov, as the
father.

“The Miracle’ *
Choirs, battles, bullfights and
storms dominate the sheer
visual entertainment of this
expensive semi-epic; and lest
anyone miss the point of the
title, minor miracles and coinci-
dences pop-up at regular inter-
vals.
Carroll Baker plays the lead
in the allegorical story of a
novitiate torn ’twixt two desires
—to overcome her imperfections
and become a bride of Christ,
and to yield to the flesh and
become the bride of the nephew
of (no less) the Duke of Wel-
lington (Roger Moore). Yield-
ing at the psychological
moment when she can’t reach
her lover, she falls in with a
band of gipsies, and when
shown a watch supposedly
taken from the lover’s corn,
stays and eventually coS
to marry one ot the bro 2

“The Miracle,” then, con'

pros and cons of the neces-
sary evils in a necessarily
imperfect world. The dual per-
sonalities are, of course,eventu-
ally reconciled when the lovers
meet again in the worldly
world, and Miss Baker reverses
her original choice, rejects the
real lover, and returns to the
nunnery. The Madonna and
the plenty she assures reappear,
and the point of the story is
deemed made and understood.

“All the Fine Young
Cannibals”
A slow-moving and tedious
inquiry into the love-lives of
four teenagers who have
rebelled against parental
authority and find, too late,
that the marriages they rushed
into have shaky foundations. I
It is made the more disappoint-
ing by overstatement and con-
tinual hamming by Robert

the guilty lovers who each
marry someone else. The only
thoughtful contributions come
from George Hamilton, as a

Bitumen and Oil Refineries (Aust.)
operations continued at an efficient
U and profitable level. Consolidated
earnings improved, arid a higher ord.
dividend was paid. Further expansion is
under way.
Bitumen and Oil Refineries (Australia),
Ltd., also known as Boral, was formed
in 1946 with powerful support from
Caltex, which originally had taken-up 40
p.c. of the ords.
In 1955 two simultaneous share-issues
(one-for-five bonus and two-for-five cash)
raised paid capital to £2,000,000. Next
year 500,000 7-8 p.c. 20s. prefs. (redeem-
able at the co.’s option at 225. 6d. each
any time between July 1, 1961, and June
30,2000) lifted subscribed capital to the
present level of £2,500,000.
Boral produces petrol, gas-making and
fuel oil and bitumen from a large modern
refinery at Matraville, near Sydney. A
wholly-owned subsidiary, Queensland
Oil Refineries Pty., runs a smaller
refinery in Brisbane and operates a bulk-
bitumen terminal at Townsville (Q.). The
income comes mainly from production
of bituminous products and road-
construction work. Similar activities are
carried on by W. B. Carr Constructions
Pty, another fully-owned subsidiary
operating in N.S.W. and Victoria.
The co. is now producing and market-
ing a wide range of solvents. A sub-
stantial interest is held in Petrochemical
Holdings, Ltd., which controls Paccal
(Petroleum and Chemical Corp. of Aus-
tralia, Ltd.) and Commercial Solvents
Pty., plus 45 p.c. of the issued capital of
Australian Petrochemicals Pty., recently
formed in partnership with Monsanto
Chemical Co. of St. Louis, U.S.A.
(holding 55 p.c. of the issued capital) to
Produce styrene monomer.
Australian Petrochemicals Pty. expects
0 commence production when its Silver-
*ater. (N.S.W.) plant, now under con-
duction, is completed in 1961.
'he refineries at Matraville and Bris-
une operated “continuously and satis-
ctorily” with higher throughput and
last year. At Matraville
riional product-tankage was installed.
Jjuipment, buildings, etc., were extended
and improved.
Consolidated trading profit for the year
ended June 30, 1960, was £503,749 higher
at £1,191,340, after providing £348,573
for depreciation and amortisation (up
£9259). Tax-provision at new co. rates
absorbed £491,200 (up £217,568), leaving
consolidated net profit £286,181 (or 69.1
p.c.) higher at £700,140:

After paying pref. divs. (£40,000) this
represented an earning-rate of 33 p.c.,
compared with 18.7 p.c. in the previous
year, and 15.2 p.c., 21 p.c., 23.2 p.c.,
31.6 p.c. and 37.8 p.c. back to 1954.
The ord. div. was raised from 15 p.c.
to 17} p.c. by a 2} p.c. “bonus-loading,”
and absorbed £350,000.
Reserves received £310,140, but were
reduced by £55,661 note-issue expenses

the staff fund. Total reserves and unap-
propriated profits were disclosed at
£1,569,747, free of intangibles.
The attractively presented consolidated
balance-sheet shows a jump in long-term
borrowings and an increase in the book-
value of fixed assets.
During the year Boral made an issue
of £2,000,000 8 p.c. registered unsecured
notes (repayable 1967 and 1971) to pro-
vide funds for the installation of the fluid
catalytic cracking-unit and ancillary
equipment at the Matraville refinery.

The petroleum and petrochemicals
industry in Australia is becoming increas-
ingly competitive. However, there is
scope for further growth as the national
economy continues to expand.
Boral’s scrip, sells at a heavy premium.
At the last sale in Sydney the 20s. ords.
fetched 87s. each, for an immediate
yield of 4 p.c. on the basis of the pre-
sent • \l} p.c. div.-rate. The 7-8 p.c.
redeemable cum. prefs. last changed
hands at 245. 6d. for each 20s. unit,
returning 6.5 p.c. p.a.
Net tangible asset-backing works out
at £Bl 7s. lid. for each 20s. pref. and
355. Bd. for each 20s. ord. on the con-
solidated accounts.
The co. intends to subdivide the ord.
capital into ss. units early in October.
Adelaide Cement Holdings, Ltd.
A delaide Cement is benefiting from a
steady increase in demand for cement
and cement products. Output is expand-
ing and earnings are rising.
Incorporated in S.A. in 1913, Adelaide
Cement Holdings, Ltd., controls the
operating Adelaide Cement Co., Ltd.,
which shares the South Australian
cement-market with the South Australian
Portland Cement Co., Ltd., based on
Angaston (S.A.). Following the reorga-
nisation of Adelaide Cement Co., Ltd.,
at the beginning of last term the present
holding-co. was formed, and shareholders
received an effective two-for-one bonus-
issue. Pref. capital (15,000 8 p.c. 20s.
f.-p. cum. prefs. at June 30, 1959) was
converted to ords., and Adelaide Cement
Holdings, Ltd., started-off with a one-
class paid capital of £918,750 in
3,675,000 ss. ords.
Brisk market conditions resulted in
a steady increase in earnings. The
accounts look a bit cagey, although con-
solidated figures are presented for the
first time. Consolidated net profit for
the year ended May 31, 1960, was dis-
closed at £151,441 (£16,291 higher than
the operating co.’s net earnings in 1959).
This was after paying all expenses and
directors’ fees, setting-aside a solid
£166,600 for depreciation (up £16,600
and providing £129,425 for taxation (up
£9425):

to an earning-rate of 16.5 p.c. on the
average new capital (50.5 p.c. on paid
capital before the reorganisation). This
compares with 44.6 p.c. earned in the
previous term, 36.7 p.c. in 1958 and 32.6
p.c. in 1957.
The tax-provision seems very generous
allowing for higher post-Budget co.
rates.
Shareholders received £76,537 p.c. in
divs. (8j p.c. on the new capital). Re-
serves benefited by £74,904 and were dis-
closed at £673,450, subject to £603,750
intangibles (surplus of cost of shares in
subsidiaries over the face-value), which
had appeared in the consolidated accounts
as a result of the reorganisation.
Of the £900,000 advanced by the State
Bank of S.A., £404,784 was outstanding
at May 31, 1960. The loan was originally
secured by a State Government guarantee
and debentures, and carried an interest
of less than 4 p.c. This had provided a
considerable source of cheap finance
while the co. was building-up its pro-
ductive capacity.
In 1959 the loan was converted to
a bank-overdraft. The present interest-
rate is higher than the original 4 p.c.,
but still well below the cost of borrow-
ing on the open market.
Except for the appearance of intan-
gibles the consolidated balance-sheet
shows no dramatic changes. Creditors
increased. Stocks were higher:

During the year the co. spent nearly
£400,000 on additional plant, machinery
and equipment. This includes the cost
of m.v. Maltara, used to transport lime-
stone from the co.’s quarries at Klein’s
Point, near Stansbury (S.A.). Formerly,
the vessel was on charter.
Other major items were an additional
cement mill and replacement of the
crushing-plant at the quarry by larger
and more modern equipment to cope
with the higher tonnage of limestone
now required.
“Although this expenditure will not
materially increase production of
cement, it will certainly add to efficiency
and assist in attaining an even flow of
output.” A second raw mill is being
installed.
At the last sale in Adelaide the ss.
ords. changed hands at 14s. lid. The
immediate yield is 2.8 p.c. on the basis of

Carrier Air Conditioning (Hold-
ings), Ltd.
/Carrier Air Conditioning (Holdings),
Ltd., was formed in 1958 as a holding
co. for the operating Carrier Air Condi-
tioning, Ltd., established in 1932 to
manufacture and distribute in Australia
and New Zealand air-conditioning and
other equipment under licence from
Carrier Corporation of U.S.A.
Since then, Carrier Air has become a
leader in this field. Population-growth,
a steady increase in the rate of building
and rising living-standards have ensured
an expanding market for the co.’s pro-
ducts. The co.’s earnings have been
rising slowly but surely despite brisk
competition. Carrier Air had an excep-
tionally good year in 1958 when the
earning-rate touched 46 p.c.
The co. now manufactures a wide
range of refrigeration-compressors, self-
contained space and room air-condition-
ing units, condensors, cooling- and heat-
ing-coils, fans and duct-work for use in
factory, office- and home-buildings,
mines, ships, etc.
Carrier Air contracts for installation
of its equipment and provides the main-
tenance-service. There is a growing
export-trade with New Guinea.
Rapid growth of the air-conditioning
industry, stimulated by favorable
weather conditions, has created a shortage
of qualified personnel.
Carrier Air is setting-up special train-
ing-schemes in air-conditioning for
engineers associated with the co. Con-
tinuous research is going on and close
contact is maintained with Carrier Corp.
of U.S.A.
At present the main production-centre
is located at Seven Hills (near Sydney).
Branch-factories operate in Melbourne,
Adelaide and Brisbane. Rising demand
has created a need for expansion of the
co.’s plant-capacity.
Plans are currently under way for
further extensions to buildings, plant and
equipment. A subsidiary, Spiro Duct
Pty., was incorporated in Victoria dur-
ing last year to manufacture circular
duct.
Last term trading conditions were
generally favorable. But competition is
increasing, spurred-on by the lifting of
import - restrictions. “Considerable
expansion” was reported in orders
received. Turnover increased appreci-
ably and “output was at a record level.”

f Effective rate on capital of Carrier Ait Con-
ditioning, Ltd.
The small fall in tax-provision seems
anomalous at first sight, but the co. over-
provided £3115 for taxation in 1958-59.
The current provision appears adequate
at ruling co. rates.
The earning-rate was 22.8 p.c. on the
average capital, compared with 22 p.c. in
the previous term and 46 p.c. in 1958 (on
lower effective capital of operating co,).
The div.-rate was steady at 12{ p.c.
(£111,458). Reserves received £91,607
and also benefited by £50,000 transferred
from provision for service and contin-
gencies.
The co. revalued land and buildings by
£65,892 following an “independent
valuation.” This raised the fixed assets
revaluation reserve to £120,000.
Carrier Air’s continuous growth has
called for more capital. Par issues in
1955 (one-for-two) and 1956 (one-for-
one) had raised the operating-co.’s equity
capital from £175,000 to £535,000. to
1955 the £50,000 pref. capital was con-
verted into 7 p.c. notes. A capital-
reconstruction in 1958 had resulted in
formation of the present holding-co-
with a paid capital of £891,668, the share-
holders benefiting by a virtual two-tor-
three bonus-issue.
Last April the co. made a one-for-nine
issue at 10s. premium on each ss. unit.
The issue was fully subscribed by J une
30, 1960, lifting paid capital to
£1,000,000 in ss. ords., but the new
funds did not participate in last term
operations.
The consolidated balance-sheet sho
a large increase in working-capital (h°
£459,544 to £802,551). Debtors, incit-
ing h.-p. debtors (the co. operates
own h.-p. sales-scheme) increase
£270,460 to £530,594. This include

'T'he Royal Agricultural
Society of Tasmania and
the National Agricultural and
Pastoral Society of Tasmania
(which is based on Launceston)
joined forces in organising
this tour for representatives of
the press and radio. It was
held on the eve of their two
annual Shows and sponsored
by the Shell Company of
Australia and Shell Chemical.
On the morning of’Septem-
ber 5 we assembled at the
Launceston Ansett - A.N.A.
terminal, were greeted by our
leaders and boarded a Pioneer
coach, captained by Len
Dunlop. Front-men were J. A.
(“Johnno”) Johnston, vice-
president of the Royal; John
Lyne, councillor of the
National; Ken Sands, Shell’s
sales-promotion officer from
Melbourne head-office ; Trevor
Gibson, Shell p.-r.-o. in the
Hobart district (who was
responsible for the tour’s
efficient administration); and
lan Hunter, of Shell Chemical.
Entally
Our first stop was at
Entally, former manor-house
of the village of Hadspen,
eight miles out on the Bass
Highway. This ancient home-
stead with its parkland,
lawns, flowers, kitchen-
garden, orchard, stables, farm-
yard, private chapel and 70-
acre farm—was bought by the
Tasmanian Government in
1950 and handed-over to the
Scenery Preservation Board
for development as a memorial
to the early settlers.
The house and its outbuild-
ings date from 1820, when
Thomas Reibey, son of
Sydney’s famous Mary Reibey,
first settled there. It was later
the home of a second Thomas
Reibey, former Archdeacon of
Launceston and Premier of
Tasmania, and has now been
refurnished in the style fitting
a wealthy settler’s estate —
neither subduing nor exagger-
ating the Reibeys’ influence,
but aiming to preserve the best
available specimens of an age
of craftsmanship and good
taste which ended with
Britain’s industrial revolution.
The early settlers were proud
of their ancestral belongings
and brought them to their new
land. So in the homestead at
Entally you will find classic
examples of English furniture,
wall-hangings, silver, china and
glass; in the outbuildings
there are carriages, saddlery
and farm-implements ; and all
were made by hand.
The interest of Entally lies
in a paradox. Superficially
English, it’s a monument to
Kay and Anne Stuart at Valmont, Whiteinoie .
the time when men of pro-
perty could live in Australia
like the foxhunting squires of
England. But there’s this
difference: in Van Diemen’s
Land, around 1820— though
never in England—acres and
labor were almost unlimited
and could be had for the mere
asking. You’d go a long way
in tlie Old Country before
you'd find such wealth of old
tradition gathered in one place
and all dated about the same
and I suspect that the
only other part of the world
"'here you would find anything
approaching this collection
"ould be in the southern
«es of the U.S.A.
The property, open to the
Mic every day, is maintained
l a team of hostess, caterer
and manager, with an outdoor-
aft of three. The board runs
small Corriedale flock on
Proved-pastures and makes
a minor, but
able, sideline. During the

With an average rainfall of
28 inches, this 2000-acre pro-
perty is mainly second-class
land with a northern frontage
on the Meander River. The
Archers took the place over
in 1893 and have developed it,
these last 20 years, from
virgin timber to permanent
pasture, sowing sub.-clover
(mostly Mt. Barker), white-
clover and rye-grass. Forage-
crops of Algerian-oats, turnips
and pasture-hay have been
conserved, and about 150 tons
of super, are used each year
for topdressing.
The Corriedale stud, regis-
tered in 1917, has done well
at Melbourne Royal. In this
year’s July sheep-sales a stud-
ram from Quamby Plains got
top price—s2sgns., which is
believed to be the highest price
ever paid for a Tasmanian
Corriedale at auction in Vic-
toria.
The team for Launceston
National is three rams . and
seven or eight ewes, but they’re
not showing at Hobart,
because that Show clashes with
shearing.
Besides this stud, the
Archers run a flock of Corrie-
dales and a herd of Devon
cattle.
Forest Holme
Two miles from Deloraine
we came to Graeme and
Beverley Davis’s Landrace-pig
stud. Here, on their original
150 acres, the Davis team
started mixed-stock farming,
with dairying and a few sheep.
Stud Suffolks, introduced in
1950, have done well.
Since then, though, they
have bought more land and
in 1957 Davis became (what he
calls) “the laughing-stock of
the district” by importing a
Landrace boar and two sows
from Northern Ireland. These
pigs cost him 1500gns. The
progeny sold well —he got
5000gns. for three Landrace
pigs in one day and has been
carrying the good work on
since.

Hotel, we moved to Claude

Exton House, Westbury, where
studmaster George Smith gave
us a look at some of the team

This was equivalent to an
earning-rate of 8.6 p.c. on the
average capital, compared with
5.3 p.c. in the previous term.
Earnings of the subsidiary,
Queensland Textile Co. Pty.,
amounting to £8651 (up £813),
were taken into account to the
extent of the £7500 dividend
received by the parent. Tax
provision, calculated at post-

Following the current trend,
Bruce Pie “after consideration
of independent revaluations,”
wrcte-up its book-assets by
£116,290. The revaluation “is
designed solely to give share-
holders a more correct record
of values of the co.’s assets. It
is not proposed that it be
followed by a bonus-issue of
shares.” The move probably
also serves as a defence against
potential takeover-bids.

provision) were higher. Stocks,

The board is optimistic about
future prospects, although con-
ditions in the textile and bed-
ding industries remain very
competitive. The co. is now
producing garments for the
summer trade. This has
achieved a more balanced out-
put in the knitwear-section, and
has reduced the co.’s depend-
ence on seasonal conditions.
However, the whole textiles
industry remains in a difficult
position due to high costs, keen
business rivalry and the con-
stant threat from imports pro-
duced under a lower cost-struc-
ture. Spectacular profits can
hardly be expected and the
sharemarket values the scrip
accordingly.

THE MANGO-TREE
By M. T. PEZET
Jean heard the shaking of
the mango-tree branches
and went to the window.
The young Fijian boy
who walked through her yard
every morning was there
again, taking more mangoes,
stuffing the front of his
patched khaki shirt with them.
She sighed. How she
gloated when she saw the five
mango-trees, all loaded with
fruit, for the first time, a few
weeks before. She had thought
she could feast on them, and
how generous she could be
with the neighborhood chil-
dren, though there seemed to
be plenty of trees in their
yards, too.
She had not realised that
the Fijians would not have her
own strict sense of property.
The houses were only separ-
ated by hibiscus hedges, with
gaps left for people to walk
through, and everyone who
went through the yard helped
himself to her mangoes.
Jean bought hers from the
door. She could have picked
them from the tree, but she
didn’t like green mangoes.
The Indians sold ripe common
ones for a penny each. She
didn’t mind the Fijians taking
the common mangoes, but one
of the trees was a turpentine-
mango, which she loved. Still,
she thought, I am in the
Fijians’ country and I don’t
want to do the wrong thing.
She mentioned it to her
neighbor, a Fiji-born woman.
“It hurts to see them taking
those lovely mangoes. Half
the time they don’t even eat
them,” she added. “Just take a
bite and throw them on the
ground for us to clean-up.”
Her neighbor snorted.
“Huh, why don’t you stop
them?”
“It’s their country and their
land,” she said. “I thought
that they must have a right
to them. I didn’t want to break
any unspoken law.”
Her neighbor laughed out-
right.
“Don’t be a fool. Tell them
to get out of it. They’ll put
it over you as much as they
can just because you are new
here.”
Jean was indignant.
“Do you mean to say that
they have no right to them at
all, Mrs. Smith?”
“None, unless you want to
give them to them,” was Mrs.
Smith’s reply. “They didn’t
plant the trees. They don’t
care whose land a garden is
on ; it’s who planted it that
matters to them. That’s why
they don’t care about taking
your mangoes. You didn’t
plant the trees, but still, they
ar e in your compound, and the
Fijians didn’t plant them
either.”
Jean walked thoughtfully
back to her house through the
gap in the hedge,

“You’re travelling by air,
which is fast and comfortable.
You’ll have a Fijian girl to do
the housework so you can rest
as much as you want. All in
all, I think you will be better
off there than here.”
It was six months now, and
she had begun#to make tbe
baby-clothes. She had been
afraid to start before then.
She glanced up. That Fijian
boy was back again at her

Jean went to the window.
“Go away,” she called. “You

He looked up, took two
more mangoes, and walked out
of the yard. When he joined
his friends, she heard them
burst out laughing. She
flushed. They were laughing
at her, she thought, and her
heart began to beat excitedly.
Calm down, she told herself.
Don’t get upset over silly
things like that. She began to
embroider the green leaves on
the jacket and gradually forgot
the boy.

to get the Fijians to leave her

National Product Up 8.1 p.c.
During the year ended
March 31 the value of goods
and services produced in New
Zealand brought the gross
rational product, valued at
current prices, to a total of
£1233 million—B.l per cent,
more than the total for
1958-59. This is shown in a
statement by the Government
statistician, Mr. J. V. T. Baker.
The national income, the
sum-total of rewards for
factor services rendered in
N.Z. and other countries by
N.Z. residents, increased to
145 million in 1959-60 —a
k of 8.3 per cent.
Of the three main com-
ponent parts of national
income, salaries and wages
increased from £560 million to
£594 million (a 6.1 per cent, in-
crease) ; company profits before
distribution rose from £llO
million to £llB million (7.3 p.c.

income increased from £247

in the k’i lan improvement
of
- mer million) is
naturally accompanied by a
far-reaching change in the
whole structure of economic
flows.
“The principal change has
occurred in the expenditure-
savings pattern of the private
sector, where personal con-
sumption has fallen from
62.5 p.c. to 62.0 p.c. of the
gross national product, and
parallel to this, private sav-
ings have increased from 6 p.c.
to 13.3 p.c. of private income.
“The share of personal
expenditure is thus well below
its post-war average (64.5 p.c.),
and savings are above the post-
war average savings ratio of
11 p.c.”
Trade-promotion
N.Z. should spend up to
£5 million a year for the next
five years on trade-promotion,
the Minister of Industries and
Commerce, Mr. Holloway
believes.
“Not all of the money
should come from the Govern-
ment,” he said. “Some should
be contributed by the producer
boards and big combined
export interests.
“I believe it would be the
best investment this country
could have,” he * said. “With
the possibility of changes in
the market in the United
Kingdom and Europe, right
now is the time.
“We have been too niggardly
in the amount of money we
have spent, not only through
the Government but through
other agencies. It would
enable us to make our mark
in the world.”
Meat
N.Z.’s total meat-produc-
tion for the year to September
30, 1960, has been estimated
by the Department of Agricul-
ture at 754,000 tons, compared
with 736,300 tons in the
1958-59 season. The principal
increase is in lamb, forecast
at 270,600 tons, against
255.400 in the previous year.
In recent years meat-produc-
tion has risen spectacularly.
For example, total production
in 1954-55 was 637,200 tons,
whereas last year it exceeded
700,000 tons for the first time.
Increases in lamb and mutton
are mainly responsible for the
expansion.
The figures for various types
of meat with those for 1958-59
in parentheses are as follows:
Lamb, 270,600 tons
(255.400) beef, 222,500 tons
(213.400) ; mutton, 162,900
tons (168,400); pig -meat,
40.400 tons (43,500); edible
offal, 34,600 tons (32,800); and
veal, 23,500 tons (22,900).
N.Z. this year has sold
frozen and chilled meat in 20
different countries, six more
than last year, and it sold
29,540 tons more.
The percentage sold to
markets outside Britain has
changed little, being 23.6 p.c.
last year, against 24 p.c. this
year.
The British market in the
1960 season took 263,323 tons,
compared with 242,161 tons
last year, or more than three-
quarters of the total produc-
tion for export.
Japan, which was sixth on
the list of N.Z. customers last
year, has this year stepped into
third place, now ranking ahead
of Canada. Japan this season
took 8799 tons, compared with
1273 tons last year. The U.S.
accepted only 45,737 tons this
season against 57,603 tons last
year.
Rental Factories
A number of applications
has been received from manu-
facturers for proposed Govern-
ment rental factories, but none
has yet been granted.
The Minister of Industries
and Commerce, Mr. Holloway,
has explained that the scheme
is not designed to provide easy
finance. Its purpose is to
encourage industry in centres
tfiat could not possibly hope
to have any otherwise and
where it is needed for social
purposes.
Decimal Coinage
A prediction that N.Z.
would have decimal coinage
by 1965 was made by Mr.
R. F. Wilson, a member of
the Decimal Coinage Com-
mittee, when addressing the
New Zealand Electrical Supply
Authorities’ Association secre-
taries.
At present N.Z. forms a
minority group, with approxi-
mately 4 p.c. of the world,
which still does not count its
money in decimal coinage. Of
these, South Africa is com-
mitted to decimal coinage, and
in Australia a committee has
recommended it.
In the case of N.Z. the
changeover is estimated to
cost £8 million to £9 million.


International Commission of Jurists' Report on Tibet
Khrushchev’s Colonialist Comrade
Colonialism, in the professed view
of Mr. Khrushchev, is dead and
even in those places where it isn’t
dead it should be, and, dead or
alive, he wants it buried forthwith.
Khrushchev makes no distinction
between types of colony—all colonialism
is imperialist aggression—or between
degrees of dependence. All dependent
territories must be granted immediate
independence. All “strongholds of
colonialism,” including possessions
and leased areas on territories of
other countries, must be “eliminated.”
And all nations must be called on to
observe provisions of the U.N. Charter
relating to respect for the sovereign rights
and territorial integrity of other countries.
Read in a political and historical
vacuum this statement would seem high-
souled and noble. Coming from the dic-
tator of the country whose iron heel
is on the neck of all Eastern Europe it
is at once ludicrous and terrifying in
its hypocrisy.
Fourteen of Khrushchev’s audience
were attending the U.N. Assembly as the
first representatives of newly indepen-
dent nations, all of them former colonies
or dependencies of European Powers
which were now prepared to accept them
as equals in international councils. In
addition the Assembly included more
than a score of other nations which
since the end of World War II had
achieved independence after having been
for varying periods under the control of
Britain, France, Holland, Italy or the
United States. No country represented
at the Assembly could be said to have
been given its independence by Russia.
An Khrushchev’s definition of
imperialism and colonialism it
would be impossible to exclude from
those categories vast areas of the
Soviet Empire. In the 19th century,
while the western European Powers were
carving-up Africa into colonies and
spheres of influence, Tsarist Russia was
extending its sovereignty over Central
Asia. All the territory conquered by the
Tsars is now ruled by the Soviet and to it
have been added the Communist satellite
countries under the nominal control of
home-grown Governments whose every
action is dictated from Moscow.
The satellites are represented at U.N.,
but the occasions on which they have
voted out of step with Russia tally
exactly with the number of times the
Statue of Liberty has jumped over the
Empire State Building.
Second only to Russia as a modern
colonial Power is its blood-brother Red
China. Like Moscow, Peking has not
only no intention of granting indepen-
dence to its colonies, but has every inten-
tion of extending its boundaries still
further, claiming every scrap of terri-
tory that was ever conquered or claimed
by imperial China—and more besides.
Within a few days of Khrushchev’s
call for the liquidation of colonialism his
spokesman on the steering committee of
the Assembly once more attempted to
sponsor the claim of Red China for
admission to U.N. He was unsuccessful
-—in Khrushchev’s view because of the
imperialist Powers and other countries
which are “the lackeys of imperialism.”
Tf Khrushchev is sincere about the duty
_ of all nations “to respect the sovereign
rights and territorial integrity of other
countries,” it is reasonable to apply this
test to his ally, China. If subscribers to
the Charter must obey it then surely an
intending member should be required to
show its bona fides before admission.
On this score there is quite recent evi-
dence available to members of U.N.
It was available to Khrushchev well
before he addressed the Assembly, and
it is in the form of a report of a legal
committee appointed by the Inter-
national Commission of lurists to inquire
into the actions of China during and
since the Red invasion of Tibet.
The International Commission of
Jurists is a non-governmental organisation
with consultative status with the United
Nations Economic and Social Council.
Its avowed purpose is to foster under-
standing and respect for the law. Its
president is a former judge of the
Supreme Court of India and its- members
include judges and lawyers of distinc-
tion from Australia (Sir Owen Dixon),
Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Burma, Canada,
Chile, Denmark, Germany, Holland,
India, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Nigeria,
Pakistan, the Philippines, Sweden and
the United States.
Last year, following a report by one
of its fnembers, Mr. Purshottam Trikan-
das.(senior advocate, Supreme Court of
India), on “The Question of Tibet and
the Rule of Law,” the commission
appointed a committee to inquire into
and report on aspects of the Chinese
occupation of Tibet; in particular
whether the crime of genocide had been
committed and whether China had
violated human rights in Tibet.
The committee’s report was published
in August. The committee was not
satisfied that the evidence produced
before it proved an intention to destroy
Tibetans as Tibetans, but it was satisfied
that “the Chinese in Tibet intended to
destroy as such a religious group,
namely, Buddhists in Tibet.”
The evidence shows that conspicuous
religious figures have been killed in an
attempt to induce others to give-up their
faith. It also shows that large numbers
of the new generation of Tibetans are
being transferred by force to an environ-
ment where the old religion of their parents
cannot reach them. These acts are part
of a general design to eradicate religious
faith in Tibet, and by so doing to destroy
the religious group. In brief, acts con-
demned as genocidal have been com ■
to destroy Buddhism in Tibet n ?' tted
intent is that there shall be no rIA
left there. De no Bu ddhist s
Evidence from Chinese official
showed clearly the intention to s t %
out Buddhism as a necessaV J
towards imposing Communism on P
masses. The committee says that if ?
Chinese stories of ruthless opp res ' '
the lamas in the name of religion
true, then “to weed-out this undesirable
feature would perform a service to
religion.” But evidence showed it !
not true and that the attack was o
principles as distinct from persons sun.
posedly abusing those principles. ,
Qverwhelming evidence is contained
, ln report of lamas and priests
being beaten, tortured, mutilated and
murdered. Monks sworn to celibacy
were forced to take wives, many who
refused being killed; images, holy p j c .
tures and sacred writings were defiled
broken and destroyed in public; young
monks were conscripted into the army
or put to road-work. Killings were
carried out by shooting, by drowning,
beating to death, hanging (one witness
testified that he saw five lamas strangled
by a rope “with a heavy image of
Buddha providing the necessary force”),
crucifixion, burning, vivisection or bury-
ing alive.
In addition to the specific crime of
genocide the committee found that the
Chinese had violated the human rights
of Tibetans in numerous ways. A few:-
• . By acts of murder, rape and arbitrary'
imprisonment; torture and cruel, inhuman
and degrading treatment; forcible trans-
fer of children to China and indoctrina-
tion of children against parents; large-
scale deportations; confiscation of
property; suppression of freedom of
thought, conscience and religion; the
exaction of labor under harsh and ill-paid
conditions. -
The committee held that
Chinese allegations that the Tibetans
enjoyed no human rights before the entry
of the Chinese were found to be based
on distorted and exaggerated accounts of
life in Tibet. Accusations against the
Tibetan “rebels” of rape, plunder and
torture were found in cases of plunder
to have been deliberately fabricated and
in other cases unworthy of belief for this
and other reasons.
The report of the committee is a docu-
ment of about 350 pages, and it includes
testimonies from hundreds of Tibetans
who escaped to India after the Chjnes
invasion. Only one of the nine signa
tories is a European (Rolf Christophs
son, secretary-general of the Norweg

seems reasonable to claim
( lJ Lady Sybil is the best

one °f the best seen out
many years. The ease of
r Wln m the £3OOO Edward
Manifold Stakes, run over one
mile at Flemington last Satur-
day, had to be seen to be
appreciated. She had won her
three races this time up prior
to Saturday’s run, and at level
weights looked a good bet. But
“Miss Edwards, you Were three minutes, twenty-five
and three-fifths seconds late this morning !”
it was not to be expected that
she could trounce another good
filly in Lady Major as
thoroughly as she did.
Geoff Lane quickly took up
the running on Lady Sybil and
the filly bowled along comfort-
ably to the home-turn. Given
a bit more rein, she cleared
right away to beat Lady Major
by 10 lengths, with the Sydney
filly Princess Delville third.
By Count Rendered (imp.) from
Cassiopeia, Lady Sybil was bought
in New Zealand by bloodstock-
agent Mel Marshall, acting for
Cyril Doody, for 500gns. In May
this year Doody sold the filly for
3000gns. to C. H. Buchanan and
his wife. No doubt Doody thought
he had obtained a good price, as
Lady Sybil had not won any race
of note. Now she would be worth
ten times her sale-price. She may
tackle the Victoria Derby, last won
by a filly—Frances Tressady—in
1923.

In some ways Nilarco’s de-
feat in the 12-furlongs Turn-
bull Stakes at Flemington was
even more unexpected than
Tulloch’s eclipse at Randwick.
At least Tulloch was beaten by
a class horse, but none of the
four runners opposed to
Nilarco had any suggestion of
w.-f.-a. class. Yet the Nilo
gelding, who had won the
Craiglee Stakes by eight lengths
at his previous start, finished a
distant third behind Aircraft
(N.Z.) and Joss Sticks.
Aircraft’s win was surprising.
It was his third run in eight days,
and in the others he had finished
nearer last than first. Aircraft
drops from the 9.6 he carried in
the Turnbull to 7.7 in the Caulfield
Cup.
Joss Sticks ran another good
race, and the advice given here
last week to have an interest on
him in the Cups is repeated.
New Zealand-bred horses
won three races at Fleming-
ton. Melody Man, successful
in the 13-furlongs Stand
Handicap, was the third of
them, and his win, gained very
easily, is worth remembering.
A six-year-old gelding by
Oman (imp.) from Broiefort
Melody, Melody Man was
racing first up since he ran
third in the Wellington Winter
Handicap last July, but his
track work at Caulfield had
been most impressive, and he
was one of the best-backed
horses in the Stand Handicap.
Trainer Peter Burgess is supremely
confident that Melody Man will
win the Caulfield Cup, and as the
gelding drops 111 b. from the 8.2
he carried on Saturday, there is
more than wishful thinking in the
trainer’s hopes.

Because there was a bad
patch of ground in the chute
that goes down to the straight-
six barrier, the 4^-furlongs
Maribyrnong Trial Stakes had
to be run around the turn.
Honor of winning the first two-
year-old race of the season, the
fillies’ heat ‘of the Mari-
byrnong, went to Royal Peal,
a filly by Bob Major (imp.)
from the imported mare Royal
Progress by Watling Street
from Sun Princess.
G. R. Nicholas, founder of the
Aspro empire, who died recently,
imported Royal Progress in 1949.
Tony Lopes trains Royal Peal for
“H. Alfred,” nom-de-course of six
Melbourne doctors, all of them
newcomers to racing. They can
diagnose more wins for their filly,
who raced very sensibly to score
by three lengths.

Standing at the Talindert
property of Sir Chester Mani-
fold, chairman of the V.R.C.,
Meadow Mist (imp.) has been
a most successful sire, but
there has been a feeling that
the grey stallion’s progeny are
not at their best on heavy
ground. The track was bad on
Saturday, but it did not pre-
vent the Meadow Mist breed
from doing particularly well.
The colts and geldings division
of the Maribyrnong Trial
Stakes was run in two heats,
and both were won by Meadow
Mist youngsters. In addition,
Shady Lea, second in the fillies
division, and Meadow Mead,
third to Royal Meadow, are
by Meadow Mist.
Royal Meadow, from Lulan by
Angus (imp.), who was also bred
by Sir Chester Manifold, might
have been rather lucky to win his
heat. The favorite, Trevira, had
a most unlucky run, before finish-
ing within ha!f-a-neck of the
winner. Trevira is a good type
of colt and will certainly win
races.

Wilkes (Fr.), Double Take might

Incidentally, Bill Williamson, who
arrived back in Melbourne last
Wednesday, after a successful stay
in the British Isles, won a race at
Caulfield last Thursday (Show
Day) and a double at Flemington
on Saturday. Melbourne punters
are glad to see him home.
An extraordinary feature of
the 10-furlongs October Handi-
cap (three-year-olds), a race
usually won by a good-class
youngster, was that both divi-
sions were won by maiden per-
formers. More surprisingly
still, both winners started
favorite. Actually the fields
were poor, and the winners,
Decade and Form, deserved
their successes. Each had en-
dured an unlucky run of minor
placings, particularly Form,
who had been in the minor
money at each of his previous
five starts. One usuallly looks
to the winner of the October
Handicap to be a Derby hope,
but that would be asking too
much of Decade or Form.

The Invitation Stakes at
Caulfield last Thursday was
one of the roughest races on a
Melbourne track for many a
day. The winner, My Peak,
escaped the trouble, as he was
out in front all the way—
ridden by Geoff Lane, who is
the best rider on a front-
running horse this writer has
ever seen. But the most im-
pressive performance in the
Invitation came from Webster,
who was in continual trouble
and should have finished closer
than fourth. Webster is a par-
ticularly high-class galloper,
and could well win a rather
uncommon double—the Too-
rak Handicap and Caulfield
Cup.

next Saturday—should add
further to what has been a fine
meeting, with the w.-f.-a.
Craven Plate (10 furlongs) on
the card, and the Canonbury
“Just sparring."
and the Widden Stakes for
two-year-olds as well.
Last year Travel Boy (10-to-
-9 favorite) beat Valerius and
Book Link in the Craven Plate.
Valerius is expected to run in
next Saturday’s race, with
Tulloch and A.J.C. Derby win-
ner Persian Lyric also likely
starters at time of writing, so
it could be packed with interest.
In the two-year-old trials
at both Rosebery and Rand-
wick Young Brolga won his
heats with half-a-dozen lengths
to spare, and he duly won last
Saturday’s Breeders’ Plate by
the same margin, and at that
was easing-up in race-record
time, 58f, a second outside
Todman’s Australian record.
Clearly, Young Brolga is one
out of the ordinary.
Owner Bill Longworth, chairman
of the Sydney Turf Club, paid
2800gns. for the colt at the Rand-
wick yearling-auction last Easter.
Like the same owner’s brilliant
filly Wenona Girl, Young Brolga
is by Wilkes (imp.). Satara, dam
of Young Brolga, is by Midstream
(imp.) from Chancel by Magpie
(imp.) from Chaptrel (imp.) by
Son-in-Law—on which breeding he
could develop staying power.
Satara is a sister to the good stayer
Euphrates, winner of £22,140 in
stakes.
Mattewai, who also won two
barrier-trials, stopped quickly in
the Breeders’ Plate after leading
into the straight.
Though the field was on the
small side, with only seven
starters, the £lO,OOO A.J.C.
Derby proved a most interest-
ing comes., Persian Lyric
emerging as best stayer, but
brilliant filly Wenona Girl
turning-out to be no match for
the colts over the 12 furlongs
(she finished last, after being
ridden a copybook race by
Nev Sellwood). Brisbane’s Le
Storm, who had struggled
home to wm m Novice com-
pany at Randwick a
earlier with much less weight,
surprised by finishing a very
good second. He could prove
a strong contender before the
spring racing is all over.
Persian Lyric, a very handsome
colt, is raced by his breeder, Jack
Mandel, in partnership with Mrs.
Mandel and their daughter, Mrs.
H. Abbott. Mandel declined
2700gns. for the colt at the Rand-
wick yearling-auction. By Persian
Book (imp.) from Lyrical Lass, the
colt has now won six races, and
first-money for the Derby was
£6900. He looks like adding the
Victoria Derby to his list, and
could make it interesting in the
Melbourne Cup, though his Vic-
torian engagements have yet to be
decided on. He gets his staying
power mostly from his dam, who
is related to Trivalve, Hall Mark
and Nuffield.
Before racing began at
Randwick on Derby Day many
punters took doubles on the
Caulfield Cup and Melbourne
Cup with Tulloch as the
second leg, but the champion
was well beaten by Valerius in
the 12-furlongs w.-f.-a. Colin
Stephen Stakes, with Bardshah
a distant third. Though there
were only four starters (the
other being Grand Garry, who
earned £5O for going round)
it was a most interesting race,
especially the final stages, when

it was a real change for hi
to land the rich AJC Eps 2
on the New Zealand five-year-
old mare Ma Cherie, a pony in
appearance, but winner in her
own country over both sprint
and long-distance courses-in
fact, before she came to Syd-
ney she won a two-mile race
at Trentham in 3.19. In her
two Sydney starts before her
runaway win in the Epsom she
hadn’t shown much to warrant
strong support, but she cer-
tainly utterly outclassed Satur-
day’s big field (22 starters).
There could be no excuse for
anything beaten in the Epsom.
Ma Cherie was 19th in the early
part and 10th at the half-mile.
She then started a brilliant run
and went on to win as she hkea,
with Boorala and Gregory low
nearest of the rest. Owned by he
breeder, T. Coltman, and trained
by A. R. T. Beale, Ma Cherie is
by Faux Tirage (imp.) t ronl

The Trots
At Harold Park last Friday
night Victoria’s Heroic Action
folio wed-up his H. P. Handicap
victory of the previous week
with a stylish win in the £lOOO
Free-for-all, in a field of Cup-
dass pacers. Sibelia, having
her first run this season, was
a half-length away second after
leading until a few yards from
the post. Bathurst pacer First
Kiss trailed Sibelia for the
whole journey and seemed un-
lucky in being unable to
squeeze between the other pair
nearing the post; as it was, he
was only a head away in third
possie. Favorite Apmat once
again lost considerable ground
at the start. Battle Fling regis-
tered the necessary win in the
Oyster Bay Handicap to bring
him into Cup-class. In a brilli-
ant finish from sixth at the bell,
he outstayed leader Redwin to
get the verdict by a head. After
losing ground at the start and
trailing the field to the bell,
Nobby finished very fast to
gain third money.

Other Sports
“C.S.”: Sorry to see “Veryl”
raising the old cry about Tre-
loar’s performance at Helsinki
(B. 28/9/’6O). If memory
serves correctly, one Sydney
daily had “Treloar Fails”
splashed all over the front
page. That certainly seemed
an exaggeration if one judges
by the photograph of the
finish, which showed that there
was about an inch separating
the first six runners. It was as
bad a failure as that of Larson
—or of Devitt, if you’re pro-
Yank —in this year’s closest
finish.

“Maros”: Winner of the
1960 Sandover Medal (W.A.’s
“Brownlow”), 24-year-old East
Perth and W.A. ruckman
Graham Farmer also won it in
1956. Runner-up was East Perth
and W.A. team-mate and close
friend of Farmer’s, Ted Kilmurray,
who won the medal in 1958. There
have been two triple Sandover
winners, Haydn Bunton and Merv
Mclntosh. In 1956 Farmer equalled
Mclntosh’s 1953 record of winning
the Sandover, the Tassie Medal (for
“best and fairest” in a national
carnival) and the Simpson Medal
(ditto in W.A.-S.A. games). In
1957 Farmer dead-heated with East
Fremantle and W.A. skipper Jack
Clarke for the Sandover, but lost
on a countback. East Perth has
promised to release Farmer at the
end of 1961; understandably the
club’s been hanging on to him,
though it has thereby denied him
the chances offered by several
V.F.L. clubs.

“Tom”: The injuries, even
deaths, suffered by New
Guinea natives when playing
Rugby League-leading two
native councils to pass resolu-
tions recommending the ban-
ning of the game for natives —
have not been primarily due to
the toughness of the play (B.
21/9/’6O). Proneness of many
natives to suffer rupture of the
spleen if tackled heavily is the
trouble. That’s why native
councils and Native Affairs
officers are tending to favor
Soccer. Most native football-
teams in the Port Moresby
area this last season played the
round-ball rod<»

“Tennisite”: If you were offered
£25,000 to plough-back into your
sport, or do as you pleased with
it, what would your reaction be?
Surely you would jump at the
chance of having this handy sum
of money put into your lap with-
out you having to do anything to
earn it! Well, that’s the proposi-
tion Jack Kramer has made to the
Lawn Tennis Association of Aus-
tralia and the States for his proposed
short pro.-tour of Australia next
February. He’s guaranteed £12,000
to the capital cities and £13,000 for
his country programme. Moreover,
his playing-plan doesn’t interfere
with the big fixtures here, because
these will have finished by the end
of January. The matter is to be
decided by the Lawn Tennis Asso-
ciation of Australia soon, and
opinion now is that a tie vote of
the States seems certain. Which
would leave President Norman
Strange in the position of having
to make a casting vote. Strange
won’t want that. He has recom-
mended to the States that they
play ball with Kramer. But if he
faces a casting vote, where will he
stand? Those behind the scenes
in tennis say there is much shilly-
shally. about the attitude of some
States towards Kramer. For
example, New South Wales has
expressed its opposition to Kramer,
against the wishes of its president,
but it is prepared to make a deal
with Jack if the L.T.A. of A. gives
him the green-light. The position
is the same in Queensland.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
NEW U.N.
/Commenting on the New
York meeting of the
General Assembly, London
“News Chronicle” sees the
United Nations “moving into
the centre of the international
stage and replacing the Summit
conference as the symbolic
meeting-place of power.
“There are three main causes
for the growing authority of
the U.N.: the new majority of
uncommitted members, the
nuclear deadlock of the mili-
tarily great nations, and the
Congo.
“When the year ends there
will be 25 African member-
States compared with 10 on
January 1. With the replace-
ment of Western - dominated
regimes in the Arab countries
and the cracking of Latin
America’s solid support for the
U.S., votes are no longer a fore-
gone conclusion in the General
Assembly. A great many
friends are there to be made,
and a great many peoples are
there to be influenced.
“At first this will make things
more difficult for the West. On
issues like Algeria and South-
west Africa the Western Gov-
ernments can expect to suffer
a rough passage. But in the
long-run, as the memory of the
old colonialism fades, the
menace of the new will be
better appreciated.
“This process has already
gone far in Southern Asia,
especially in India. The agony
of Tibet, Soviet imperialism in
Central Asia and the enslave-
ment of Eastern Europe are
skeletons in the Communist
cupboard which can be dis-
played to a larger audience than
ever before.
“Because the two super-
states are militarily muscle-'
bound, neither able to deploy
its strength without injury to
itself, they have to compete
economically, scientifically, cul-
turally and, above all, politic-
ally in the U.N. forum. Here
Russia and the United States

must seek to win the favor of
Tunisia and Burma, Venezuela
and Ireland. For all the propa-
ganda and polemics which
accompany the process of in-
ternational wooing 'it is a
potentially constructive com-
petition, far more hopeful than
the concentration on the arms-
race in the past.”
The same paper naturally
took heart from the Afro-Asian
stand on the Congo crisis in the
first week of the Assembly
meeting:
“The U.N. rescue-operation
cannot succeed without the
active support of the African
nations, whose troops form the
great majority of the U.N.
force in the country and whose
Governments are not tainted
with the suspicion of colonial-
ism.
“It is therefore of great
importance that the African
delegations in the General
Assembly have combined with
some Asian members in ex-
pressing their confidence in
Mr. Hammarskjold and - in
demanding that the U.N. should
continue its operations in the
Congo. The Afro-Asian reso-
lution rebuffs the Russians by
insisting that no military assist-
ance must be offered to the
Congo except on the request of
the U.N.
“A similar resolution was
victim of the Russians’ 90th
veto in the Security Council,
but by tabling this resolution
in the General Assembly Afri-
can States have shown that
they are not to be cajoled by
Mr. Khrushchev into indentify-
ing the U.N. with colonialism.
“The Communists are persist-
ing with their tactics of attack-
ing Mr. Hammarskjold. The
drip of vitriol of denunciation
has achieved its purpose before
now, but at least the voice of
independent Africa has warned
the Kremlin that the Congo
crisis is not to be an open door
to Communist ambition.”
London “Daily Mail” com-
pares the 15-year-old United
Nations with the former League
of Nations at the same age:
“Korea showed what the
U.N. could do, provided the
will to act was there. It was
the Americans who put life
into U.N. on this occasion.
The vigorous determination of
a great Power was something
the League never had at its
command.
“The U.S. also broke the
stalemate of veto by bringing
in its so-called ‘uniting for
peace’ resolution by which the
General Assembly can take up
a problem 24 hours after the
Security Council has vetoed it
off its agenda.
“Putting so much authority
into the hands of smaller
nations was something which
the originators of the UN
never intended. Its critics s i
claim it is ridiculous f or
small nation like Finland t
have equal voting-power with
for example, the United State ’
But although the voting- poWer
may lie in the Assembly wit
the small nations (now more
than ever) the power and will
to act still he with the big ones
“The smaller nations in the
Assembly have come to re-
semble a jury. On some issues
they tend to be biased, but the
necessity of retaining their
goodwill is a useful check on
the ambitions of the Power
blocs.
“The U.N. has marked-up
other successes in the struggle
to keep the world off boiling
point in the past 15 years. The
force which has kept guard on
the Israeli-Egyptian border has
stopped bloodshed and re
moved tension, even though no
political solution has been
found. In the Congo the
recent steps have so f ar
prevented development of a
situation which could lead to
another Korea.
“Through trying times U.N
has gained experience and con-
fidence. Unlike the League it
has grown stronger rather than
weaker. This is just as we,
for the future holds toug
problems, too. The sterne
times for the U.N. may
still to come.”

“JACKSUL,” BRISBANE
reply to Dr. Worsley’s Man-
chester “Guardian” letter
which opened last week’s
“Uncabled” item on the
Gluckman affair. The reply
continues:
“While freely admitting that,
on the face of it, the Austra-
lian Government was wrong
in excluding Professor Gluck-
man from New Guirjea and
that there have probably been
a few blemishes in its colonial
administration, I think it
worth arguing that its rule in
New Guinea has probably
been among the best and least
controversial of all colonial
rules.
“There has never been any
suggestion of white men ex-
ploiting the natives and, in a
country where political opposi-
tion is anything but voiceless,
there has never been any con-
troversy over major Adminis-
tration policy there ; only over
specific points.
“If there is a criticism it
is that the Administration is
excessively fatherly and too
anxious to shield its charges
from the wicked and hard
world. What does Dr. Wors-
ley consider the ‘much’ Aus-
tralia has to be ashamed of
in New Guinea?
“The condition of the rem-
nants of the mainland aborigi-
nal population is, of course,
deplorable, but in the last 100
years the sins of the white
community have been those of
omission rather than commis-
sion. It is simply that Stone
Age people were suddenly
thrust into the middle of a
modern community and no-
body tried hard or consistently
enough to help them to
adjust.
“The Australian Govern-
ment tolerates ‘principled dis-
sent from its owp viewpoints’
at the rate of thousands of
written and spoken words
daily. Some of Mr. Menzies’s
staunchest and most power-
ful newspaper allies, let alone
the Opposition, dissented from
his views quite volubly when
he was negotiating in Cairo.
Mr. Casey’s attack on J. B.
Priestley was made in detailed
context in a particular
instance ; he has not been in
the habit of ‘Red-baiting.’
“A recent Gallup poll
showed that (I think) about
55 per cent, of Australians
favored limited Asian migra-
tion of some kind. I suggest
that this shows just as many
‘liberal values’ as exist in the
migration policies of Ceylon,
Indonesia and the Philippines.”
"Free China"
'T'he Formosan Government’s
A arrest of Lei Chen (editor
of a fortnightly magazine) on
sedition charges is seen by
London “Economist’’ as a
“retrograde step that brings
no credit” to Marshal Chiang
Kai-shek’s regime or its claims
to represent “free China”:
“Mr. Lei Chen’s magazine,
ip common with a number of
other publications in Formosa,
is itself called ‘Free China.’
The charges against him arise
out of editorials, written after
Dr. Rhee’s downfall [in
Korea], calling for a cleansing
of the Formosa regime by
breaking the Kuomintang’s
virtual monopoly of political
activity, ending corruption and
curtailing the power of the
security-police, which is
headed by Marshal Chiang’s
son, General Chiang Ching-
kuo.
“Mr. Lei Chen’s real crime,
however, may have been his
participation in the prepara-
tions for a new Opposition
party together with Mr. Kao
Yu-shu, the very able former
Mayor of Taipeh, and Mr. Li
Wan-chu, publisher of the
newspaper ‘United Daily
fe ' vs -’
Mr. Li and Mr. Kao are
Taiwanese—that is, Formosan-
born ; the fact is significant.
About 18 months ago Mr. Li’s
newspaper ran a series of
articles questioning the basic
— N.Y. “Herald Tribune."
CACTUS.
assumption and raison d'etre
of President Chiang’s regime:
the doctrine of the return to
the mainland. The fact that
Mr. Li got away with it at
the time suggested that the
restrictive press law passed in
secret on June 20, 1958, was
not going to be as stringent in
practice as it looked on paper.
Mr. Lei Chen, however, seems
to have overstepped the per-
mitted mark in his ‘Free China’
articles.
“Mr. Kao and Mr. Li have
now called for Mr. Lei’s
release, and have announced
their intention to proceed with
the formation of an opposition
party. If their aim is to cut-
down President Chiang’s Gov-
ernment to its correct dimen-
sions they will have common-
sense on their side. More

jfst item m a solution of the
problem of our [the West’s]
relationship with the more-or-
!iSS revolutionary countries of
\sia Africa and America is to
p’from unilateral action to
jetion through the international
institutions.
“The second item is, I be-
lieve, to take the leadership of
the highly developed countries
in persuading them to accept
the principle that it is the duty
of the haves to finance the
have-nots in order that they
may break the vicious circle of
their backwardness. It is
highly important, in my view,
that this should be done ■as a
duty and not as a favor or as
I charity.
“The duty of the haves to the
have-nots is a new and great
idea often advanced by in-
dividuals but never as yet
adopted by Governments. It

Toronto '“Globe and Mail”
(Canada): “The way to deal
with Russia and China is not
hy trying to isolate them, but
hy being ready and able to
meet them anywhere in the
world openly, eompetitively,
dynamically—and to meet them
on our terms, not on theirs,
The failure of Western diplo-
macy these last half-dozen
years is that we have always
met the Russians and Chinese
on their terms ; we have gone
to the bargaining-table only
when forced to it by their
initiatives.
“Our attitude, in short, has
been defensive and negative,
* ts dealings w hh Russia and
China, in its whole foreign
policy, the West has been
ridden by fear. Now there is
in Canada, as in other coun-
tries, a great disquiet over the
failures, the defeats of that
policy. Yet in their platforms
the R e p.u b 1 i c a n and [U.S.]
Democratic parties appear to
be more inflexibly committed
to it than before,”

Harold Watkinson (Britain's
Minister of Defence): “The
whole range of our [Britain’s]
defence policy is an essential
part of the deterrent to war.
It must be considered as such,
and we should be gravely in
error if we do not seek always
to keep the right balance be-
tween its various elements,
whether they be conventional
or unconventional. The fact
that we have kept the peace so
far throughout this difficult
and dangerous period in inter-
national relations is proof that
the admittedly large sums spent
on defence have been a very
premium for an in-
surance-policy against the des-
truction of our civilisation.”

The water poured down them
and swirled away in the drain,
The Fijian boy continued to
take her mangoes, even in the
wet. The Fijians didn’t seem
to care about getting wet at
all, and Jean wondered how
many of them suffer from
rheumatism as they get older,
One afternoon, as the rain
was pouring down, Jean
walked back from Mrs.
Smith s house, and was almost
hit by a falling mango as she
walked past the tree. Looking
up, she saw the Fijian boy
she shouted. “How many
times have I told you to leave
that tree alone?”
He didn’t move.
“Get down! ” she yelled, the
rain dripping off her rain-hat
onto her face. “Can’t you
hear me? What’s your
name?”
He climbed down slowly,
looking sullen. ’
“What’s your name, I said?”
“Esava.”
“Now go away, Esava, and
don’t let me see you in this
yard again if you don’t want
me to get the police after
you,” Jean said.
Esava looked at her in-
soiently, an d slouched off,
muttering something that
sounded very like “Tikoloa.”
Jean was furious. Her heart
began its furious pounding
again, and the flush on her face
welled-up. She strode down
the path without picking her
way as she normally did. Her
sandals had plastic-rubber
soles, and as she trod pur-
posefully on the top step the
water rushing on the slippery
wood gave her no foothold,
and she crashed down the
steps onto the concrete path.
r J''HE pain, the rushed trip to
hospital, and the intense
disappointment and grief at
the loss of a perfectly-
developed son gradually turned
into a bitter personal hatred
of Esava. Her husband
couldn’t comfort her, but he
thought that she was just being
womanly and would eventually
get over it. Mrs. Smith, being
a woman, could understand
better how she felt,
“Esava didn’t mean any
harm,” she said, “He’s just a
normal Fijian boy, more of a
nuisance than a lot of them,
but what can we expect? He’s
too o i d f or sc hool, but too
young to start working for the
company.”

F an "unfortunate but
necessary phase—the irrespon-
sible adolescence of a people.
It will take one or two more
generations for them to “grow-
up.” They didn’t have the
magic of the Ndauvangunu
who still practised illegally in
many of the koros, but they
had heard enough about it to
be wary of it, although they
laughed sophisticatedly at the
older people’s belief in it, and
the tales they told of people
killed by the Ndrau-ni-kau.
Although the doctor gave
her as many sedatives as he
thought advisable, Jean was
not able to snap out of her
misery. Miserable day fol-
lowed miserable day. She
would have been better doing
her own work, but didn’t feel
strong enough. Atetha, her
rather slap-dash but cheerful
housegirl, did even the cooking
for her, so that Jean sat for
hours, just staring at the
mango-tree.
They heard over the radio
that a tropical storm was
building-up to the north of
Fiji. It was what Jean needed,
and for the first time in weeks
she took an interest in some-
thing outside herself.
She said to Mrs. Smith, “I
hope it comes here. I’d like
to see a hurricane.”
Mrs. Smith was indignant,
as any Fiji old-timers are when
newcomers want to see a
hurricane.
“You shouldn’t wish them
on anybody,” she said. “A
bad one is a terrifying thing.
And they do so much
dapiage.”
day the weather office
issued a Preliminary
Warning for Vanua Levu,
Taveuni, and the north-east
of Viti Levu. She went across
to Mrs. Smith to see what she
should do in preparation. Mrs.
Smith hadn’t done anything.
“But Wall’s place nextdoor
looks as if the hurricane has
already hit it,” Jean said.
“There isn’t a thing out.
Everything is locked away,
and they have enough tinned
food for a siege.”
Mrs. Smith laughed as she
said: “Oh, they’ve heard too
many hurricane stories. We’ve
always had time enough to
lock-up after they give the
Final Warning.”
Jean went back to listen to
the half-hourly weather
reports, but was disappointed,
as they kept repeating the
weather report of the early
morning. In the evening a
new report came in:
“The tropical storm to the
north of the group is deepen-
ing and moving slowly south-
east. Final Warning is now
issued to Vanua Levu and
Taveuni, and the Preliminary
Warning is still in force for
the north and east of Viti
Levu, extending on a line from
Mba to Suva.”
Through the night gusts of
wind blew at intervals quite
strongly. In the morning ther P
was a strong wind and 2
mangoes were falling f r l m e
the tops of the trees EvS
now and then there would £
a swish and a crash as th!
dead leaves fell from the coco
nnt-trees. Fijians going to '
work dashed into the yard!
and filled the fronts of their
shirts with mangoes.
Jean was tolerantly amm«i
at them. When young c hil
dren asked her if they could
have some mangoes, she told
them to help themselves. All
but Esava. When she saw him
walking along the street, she
walked out into the yard and
he went past with only one
glance in her direction.
The 6.30 a.m. broadcast
stated that the hurricane had
hit Vanua Levu and that the
Preliminary Warning still
applied to the north and east
of Viti Levu. Jean thought
the wind was very strong, but
Mrs. Smith said it was just
the edge of the blow.
The 8.30 a.m. bulletin sur-
prised them:
“The tropical storm has
deepened and is now moving
with increased speed in a
south-westerly direction to-
wards Viti Levu. A Final
Warning now applies to the
whole of Viti Levu.”
A sudden strong gust blew
some papers over the floor and
rattled a picture as the broad-
cast finished. Jean called
Atetha to help her close the
shutters when another stronger
gust blew the picture off the
wall, smashing the glass. Jean
picked it up and was care-
fully brushing broken glass off
it, so it wouldn’t be damaged,
when the first burst of rain
blew in through the gauze of
the back-doors, which rattled
and banged in the wind.
Hurriedly putting the picture
on the table, she rushed and
bolted the doors. The lower
halves of the doors were
panelled, but the top halves
were gauze. With no inner
doors, the rain swept through.
Then she helped Atetha close
the shutters. Many of the
bolts wouldn’t catch properly,
and she wished her husband
were there to help while they
struggled to hammer the
bolts home and the shutters
shuddered in their hands from
the wind. „
They scarcely had them a

s s ome of the wooden shutters
tanged irregularly on one
tinge until they, too, broke
and were hurled across the
yard.
Rain swept on to the beds
through the broken
stutters. It was barely pos-
sible to see through the win-
dows for the leaves blowing
against them. Jean looked out
one window on the protected
side and saw some men going
up to the powerhouse, crawl-
ing on hands and knees up the
till, their shirts and shorts
whipping about their bodies.
They could never have walked
in it.
Just then, she saw the iron
which had been banging
frantically on Walls’ fowl-
louse roof lift. It hurled
against the side of their house,
smashing a window. She
shuddered. The air was a
maelstrom of flying leaves,
branches, iron, timber and
rubbish. The back - doors
rattled loudly, but held, as
branches from the mango-
tree crashed down. The gauze
tore and a tree branch poked
inquisitive fingers into the
louse.
„ J ean heard Atetha call

ln§ ominously in one panel.

heave so much, and there
seemed to be not so much
noise. Then everything was
dead-still.
“Has it gone?” Jean asked.
“Yes, marama, but it will
be back,” Atetha said.
Jean went to a window and
looked out. The devastation
was appalling. In an hour, the
trees were almost stripped of
their leaves, as if autumn had
descended on the land. Fine
big trees were a mess of broken
branches. A big weeping-fig in
Wall’s yard was completely up-
side down in an obscene pose
with its mass of roots in the
air. Guava-trees and all the
banana-trees were down. Some
of the coconut-trees were neatly
decapitated. Others had just
broken leaves hanging down on
the lee-side. Some were half-
uprooted, and leaned over at a
dangerous angle.
Wall’s spare bedroom, which
jutted out as a peninsula on
one side of the house, leaned
in the same direction, all but
two or three sheets of iron
off the roof blown out of sight.
Whereas Jean normally was
upset at losing anything she
cherished, she looked at her
sodden books and a few
smashed ornaments without
sentiment. t
“Come on, Atetha,” she said.
“We must get busy and do what
we can before it comes back
again.”
They quickly put the un-
damaged books in a safe place
and did what they could with
the others. As they were
putting some things in a cup-
board against an inside wall,
they heard a wet crash and
rattling of saucepans in the
kitchen. They found a whole
caneite panel had crashed down
from the ceiling with the weight
of water on it, and fallen
against the saucepans under the
sink. The curtain which had
covered the open cupboard had
been ripped off long before.
“What a mess!” Jean said.
“I wish I could make a cup
of tea.”
The power had been turned
off at the beginning of the
storm and would not be
switched on for a long time.
They could see poles and wires
down in the street. Heavy
iron poles at the powerhouse
were bent over, and many
sheets of iron were blown off
the powerhouse itself.
Jean went to the cupboard
at the back to get some more
floorcloths. They were a sod-
den mess, but she took one
and went to the back-door to
wring it out. She couldn’t get
the door open because of the
branches.
As she turned to go into the
bathroom, she heard a low
moan. Turning around, she
stopped and listened but heard
nothing more. Atetha came
out to ask her something and
stood by the door. Jean put
her finger to her lips. She
joined Atetha at the door and
looked out. She could see
nothing but the mess of broken
branches, mangoes and leaves.
Just then they heard another
** sound.
“Sss. Ssss,” the usual
Fijian way of drawing
another’s attention.
Atetha pointed and called
excitedly “Marama! Marama!
Raitha !”
“I can’t see anything,” Jean
said. Then gasped. The water
lying under the mess was
crimson-tinged. She could
just make-out curly hair in it,
and patches of khaki showing
through the tangle of branches
and leaves.
“Quickly, Atetha, I think it
is Esava. We must help him.”
They pushed the door, but
only managed to open it a few
inches. Esava groane*d loudly

tremendously in his ‘recovery’
from strenuous exercise much
more rapidly than would other-
wise be the case.
“Vitamin-E is found chiefly
in wheat-germ, but since most
bread is made from flour from
which the germ has been
removed w ; e believe it is neces-
sary to take large doses of
vitamin-E in tablet-form, and
in the form of wheat-germ.”
Asked if he thought this
supplementary diet had helped
Murray in his three-medal
winning in Melbourne in 1956,
Mr. Rose said there was no
doubt that it had. “We believe
that Murray was able to
recover quickly from the
effects of five hard races which
took place over a period of
seven days,” he said.
Mr. Rose listed what he
termed a “very general” diet
which he thought gave Murray
the stamina necessary to
become the youngest competi-
tor to win three gold-medals
in Olympic Games swimming
(1956) and over greatly differ-
ing distances —i.e., 200-metres
(leg of relay), 400-metres and
1500-metres.
Here, then, is a listing of
what’s out, and what is
included instead, in this evi-
dently very efficient * athlete’s
diet:
Instead of meat, poultry,
fish and all meat- and fish-
products such as ham, fish-
paste, etc., the choice is
eggs, cheese, brown lentils,
soya-beans, lima-beans, nuts
and nut-products, millet, sun-
flower-seed meal.
Instead of white bread and
all products made from white
flour, such as biscuits, scones,
cakes, pastries, breakfast-
cereals, etc., the choice is ID-
per - cent. - wholemeal bread,
porridge, scones, cakes, etc,■
made, from soya-bean flour,
millet-flour, rye, bran and any
grain which has not been pro-
cessed or refined.
Instead of white sugar ami
all products containing it, si i
as jam, soft-drinks, candy, etc,
the choice is honey, dried-
fruits (such as raisins, date,
figs), raw brown-sugar, halva.
Instead of tea and coffee,tie
choice is fruit-juices, vege-
table-juices, unpasteurised milk
(preferably goats’ milk) and)
predominance of raw fruits
and raw vegetables of every
type.
Taking the diet is easy com-
pared to the problem of being
always able to buy all tie
ingredients, but his keen guides
—his parents—-manage to see to
it that “Mr. Seaweed’s” menu
is well and correctly suppW-

as they shifted the branches
slightly.
“We shall have to go out
the front way, Atetha,” Jean
said.
They ran to the front door,
which was on the side of the
house and leading on to a
small front landing. They ran
down the steps, which ran
parallel to the house, and
around to the back. Hurriedly
they moved some of the smaller
branches, but they were not
strong enough to shift the big
branch which pinned Esava.
Atetha ran to the laundry and
brought back the tomahawk
which she used to cut the
small wood.
She chopped away the awk-
ward branches just as the wind
began to blow in gusts again.
By the time it was sufficiently
cut down the wind was blow-
ing a gale and the rain pouring
down. Their skirts whipped
about their legs, and the hair
about their faces as they
struggled with the worst
branch. As they levered it up,
the wind caught it and dragged
it out of their hands, cutting
their palms. As they chopped
and dragged the branches,
Esava lay with his eyes closed.
Elis face was grey,- and only
the blanching of his face at
each stroke showed that he was
still conscious.
“Can you help us, Esava?”
Jean shouted.
He shook his head.
HThe back-doors were still
jammed with the rest of
the big branch. Atetha did not
wait to try it more than once.
She put her hands under
Esava’s shoulders and waved
at his feet to Jean. His
broken arms hung limply, and
as they dragged on the concrete
and debris, he groaned, the
sound being lost in the roar
of the wind. Jean put his
arms across his chest, then
lifted his legs as gently as she
could, under the knees. One
leg hung at an odd angle.
They carried him with their
clothes flapping about them,
until they reached the corner
of the house. There, Atetha
staggered as the full force of
the wind struck her. The
rain was now almost horizontal.
Flying branches and leaves
went hurtling past, with occa-
sionally a piece of timber or
iron.
Atetha shook her head and
motioned for Jean to crouch,
keeping as low as they could,
and hugging the side of the
house they edged their way
around the corner. Jean felt
as if the wind would scalp
her as her hair tore back, and
she had to keep her head low
to breathe. Now and again
they were unable to move at
all. Jean looked sideways,
peering * through her flying
hair, just as Wall’s extra-bed-
room collapsed.
The iron flew away, the
timber behind it. One piece
of iron crashed into an electric-
light pole and was wrapped
around it. The coconut-trees
that had been leaning so un-
comfortably in one direction
were now blown down in the
other.
When Atetha nodded, they
crawled forward again, slid-
ing Esava as best they could.
Timber and branches ob-
structed their way. When they
were almost to the steps, Jean
looked up and saw one of
the front gauze-doors rip off
its hinges. As she ducked still
further, it hit the wall above
her head, then hurled along,
ripping at her back with the
broken hinge.
The ascent of the steps was
even more difficult, as the wind
blowing through the gaps
threatened to throw them
down. Only Atetha’s bulk
saved them. Like most Fijian

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
* migration Benefits
s mmt this contention that
I is weakening our
Ji ties —of course it is, but
" Jis necessarily our loss?
" , don’t believe many his-
L ians would agree with the
lLy that large populations
l m ixed and unassimilable
jlfijns have been the downfall
jf e very great nation. There
jre few, if any, nations which
lave not had to contend with
invasion or migration in one
f jrra or another, and conse-
quently successive layers of cul-
lutes have been blended, in
many cases to the benefit of
he world.
Britain— which, by the way,
ad four centuries of Roman
ccupation —is paraded as an
(ample of racial unity. Per-
aps it is, though whether the
ardy northerners or the talka-
ve Welsh would agree is
lebatable. Anyway it was not
Iways so.
According to historian A. L.
lowse: “In genera], the effect
of the vulnerability of Britain
to invasion is that she has
always tended to present suc-
oessive strata of culture, and
very mixed population, the
atest arrivals being dominant,
nd the novel culture more
trongly marked in the eastern
'alf of the island than in the
western.”
The latest arrivals were not
assimilated, in some cases, for
"toy hundreds of years. On a
Prareful scale we are experienc-
es the same thing here. Many
European migrants keep strictly

South-west Africa
On October 5 the white
minority of South Africans
will vote in a referendum to
decide whether the Union is to
become a republic or remain
a dominion of the British
Crown. The result will not
“Bill's gone to a reunion and won't be home for DAZE!"
only decide the status of South
Africa itself; it may determine
also whether or not South
Africa remains within the Com-
monwealth —d epend ing, of
course, on the attitudes of
member-States of that body.
If the Union retires or is
excluded from the Common-
wealth, the question of the
future of South-west Africa
will again become hot; and,
not for the first time, it is sure
to loom large in the eyes of
international lawyers.
Lying between the Cape
Province of South Africa and
the Portuguese territory of
Angola to the north, and
having an Atlantic seaboard,
South-west Africa, with its
dreary and largely desolate
terrain, has been a subject of
international attention almost
continually since it was ac-
quired by the German Kaiser’s
Reich in the heyday of colonial
expansion; it had a certain
strategic potential and possibi-
lities of mineral development.
In 1904 a rising by the in-
digenous Hereros, a nomadic
people oppressed by German
colonialism, was put down so
thoroughly that of some 80,000
who revolted, only about a
fifth remained when the terri-
tory came under League of
Nations mandate in 1921 and
was subsequently handed to the
British Crown as trustee Power.
As a- gesture of confidence
in the South African Govern-
ment of that time, and as a
matter of convenience geogra-
phically, South-west Africa was
transferred to the Union as
trustee by consent of the
League, for the British Sover-
eign was also titular ruler of
South Africa.
With an acquisitiveness that
seems to run with newly gained
independence the South African
Government has twice within
recent years laid claim to the
former German territory as
her own right, and on each
occasion the claim has been
turned-down by the Court of
International Justice at The
Hague.
This claim has been based on
the contention that the man-
date given by the League of
Nations ended with the passing
of the League ; but the court
declared that the United
Nations was the lawful succes
sor to the League and that the
trusteeship was still extant.
Moreover, and this is worth
remembering, the judgment
added that the trusteeship or
mandate was given to the
British Crown, not to South
Africa.
It is this latter pronounce-
ment which directly impinges
upon South Africa’s proposed
annexation of South-west
Africa, and it will be interest-
ing to watch Dr. Verwoerd's
reaction should South Africa
become a republic, as seems
more than likely. Fred
Aarons (N.S.W.).
Archibald’s French Foible
As tactfully hinted by L. J.
Blake (B. 14/9/’6O), I perhaps
overstated my case when I
linked J. F. Archibald’s French
complex with the French-
derived word “Bulletin.” I
had overlooked J. F.’s brief,
inadequate and therefore tan-
talizing reference (in his
memoirs) to the choice of
name: “For The Bulletin the
name originally designed was
‘The Lone Hand.’ Circum-
stances conspired to prevent a
formal christening ...”
Nevertheless, the fact remains
that Archibald and Haynes
between them chose the present
name, from which emerges the
whimsical reflection that The
Bulletin can claim with
greater justification than Archie
could—to be of French descent.
As to when J. F. became
Julian, the earliest reference to
that name that I can find is in
his brother Joseph’s book of
news-cuttings. This contains a
clipping from the Warrnambooi
“Echo” of February 2, 1894.
It is a reprint of a “character
sketch” of Archibald pub-
lished in the “Review of Re-
views,” which was edited, I
think, by Henry Stead, son of
the well-known W. T.
The opening paragraph,
packed with misstatements of
fact, reads:
Mr. Julian F. Archibald, who is
the soul of The Bulletin, was

Most public hospitals, evei
in the country, now have up
to-date X-ray equipment aw
could earn considerable revenui
from it if they were permitta

ing. However, in the pas
couple of years private X-ray
operators have set-up in man)
country centres, and althouj
their fees are almost do#
those of the hospitals they an
born at Warrnambool, Vic., where
his father, an Englishman, was
inspector of police. His mother
was a native of France and a
descendant of a Jewish family.
She gave a Hebraic touch to the
anxious physiognomy of her son.
The only correct statements
in that paragraph concern his
surname, his second initial and
his role at The Bulletin.
As he apparently played
around for years with his
Christian-names and his ante-
cedents, it is difficult to know
when Archibald became Julian
and when he finally settled for
Jules Francois.
Another Archibald complex
was what Mrs. Macleod called
“his almost hysterical dislike of
capital punishment.” This
hatred —it was more than dis-
like —he carried to extraordin-
ary lengths on at least one
occasion.
A man was to be executed at
Wagga, and J. F., then on the
“Evening News,” travelled
there by coach with “Nosey
Bob” Howard the hangman,
and Howard’s assistant, who
were to do the job. When
the coach stopped temporarily
beyond Jun e e , Archibald
secretly took the well-greased
rope from the boot and hid it
in the bush. As a result,
Howard and his offsider had
to get a new rope and sit up
all night at Wagga to make it
sufficiently pliable.
Archibald again saw “Nosey
Bob” (who, by the way, lacked
a nose) just before the hanging
"No, madam , I can assure you that pressurised cabins of
jets have NOTHING to do with pressure-cooking."
of the bushrangers Moonlite
and Rogan. With William Mac-
leod, who was to do a sketch,
he interviewed Howard at his
Paddington home. This inter-
view, preserved in typewritten
form in J. F.’s book of news-
cuttings, must be the one that
appeared in the first issue of
The Bulletin. It is impishly
satirical. In it Archie took a
side-swipe at his old paper, the
“News,” just as years previously
he had taken a swipe at the
Warrnambool “Standard.”
Referring to a previous hang-
ing, regarding which Howard’s
professional work had been
publicly criticised, he made
“Nosey Bob” say: “You know,
sir, I’ve been badly treated by
the newspapers. The ‘Evening
News’ was too severe on me.
In fact I thought of taking
libel action against the ‘News,’
which is largely circulated
among my friends.”
I’m sorry I can’t agree with
L. J. Blake when he says it is
as Jules Feltham (Francois)
that Archibald will be remem-
bered. His surname will con-
tinue to be known, of course,
because of the Archibald Prize ;
but to the discerning minority
he will be remembered, I think,
as the Australians a l

Faith in the
Future
\
Beef is one of the “greats” in Australian
industry, and it is a sign of our national growth
that the cattle breeds paraded at this year’s
Brisbane Exhibition were so outstandingly high
in quality.
Queensland, of course, is the cattle State.
More than half our beef cattle are grazed within
its borders, which enclose an area two-and-a-half
times the size of Texas, the big cattle State
of America.
It is to -be expected that the best in beef
breeds should be shown there, from studs in
Queensland and neighbouring States. But even by
the high standards established in the past, it is
obvious that the influence of good blood is showing
plainer now in the quality of cattle being arrayed
in our national show rings.
The Santa Gertrudis and Hereford strains stand
out particularly, in recollection.
And behind these lines of ribboned champions
is the story of a fresh awareness of this country’s
enormous potential in the production of beef.
Research is allied to practice. While better animals
are being bred, big things are being done in the
field of pasture improvement. New interior roads
are to be built to link breeding and fattening
grounds, and increasing numbers of road trains
will be using them. More cattlemen are turning
to the building of dams and weirs and earth-tanks
for the watering of herds and the growing of
supplementary fodder.
The texture of the pattern is altogether strong,
but it will still need to have a long thread of faith
worked into its total weaving.
Millions more will be required to be spent —
by the industry as a whole, by individuals within
it, and by Governments —before Australia can say
it has reached a real “rate of potential” in its
beef industry.
But all the elements are here right now, to
enable us to produce the best beef in the world—
and to produce it in quantity for a world that will
be needing more and more of it with the passing
of the years.

If a hospital’s X-ray equip-

that of the private doctor, or its

would be a strong case for by-
passing the hospital; but, all
things being equal, it is clearly
to the financial advantage of
the hospital to get all the X-
ray patients it can, and the
Hospitals Commission should
encourage it to do this instead
of insisting that it divert the
most lucrative side of the busi-
ness to the private operator.
Anything that will render un-
necessary a still further in-
crease in the already high fees
for patients is of direct benefit
to the hospitals and to the com-
mission itself. — Peter Simple

Plans for A.D. 2000
Isn’t it time the Common-
wealth and States, in addition
to their annual wrangles over
funds, took a bit of time off
to sit down calmly and con-
sider what Australia’s needs
are likely to be in 40 years’
time so that adequate plans
may be made now?
If the Federal and State
people in 1920 had done some-
thing of the sort we might now
have better roads, uniform
railway-gauge and a good many
other things which are now
badly needed and almost over-
whelmingly expensive.
Power, water-supplies (in-
cluding the possibilities of de-
salination in S.A. and W.A.),
highways, aerodromes and
plenty of other subjects suggest
themselves.
Admittedly we don’t know
what new inventions are going
to change our way of life by
the end of the century, but
that would be a poor reason
for deferring any planning
now. We must have some idea
of population sizes, of the
number of schools and hospi-
tals and other services which
will be needed, of the amount
of foodstuffs we shall have to
provide for ourselves and for
export to our expanding Asian
neighbors, and of the trans-
port and communications needs
of that era.
Some estimates made now
may prove considerably astray,
but at least they would give
some kind of guide, amenable
to alteration when required.
Who will give a lead on such
a project? Perhaps someone
in the National University will
make some move. Charles
Meeking (N.S.W.).


THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Glycine Javanica
Glycine javanica, a legume
introduced from Tanganyika,
seems likely to help in im-
proving pastures along much
of the Queensland coast and
in some of the State’s beef-
fattening districts.
A creeping, vine-like peren-
nial, it grows prolifically
during late spring and summer,
and gives useful winter feed
in frost-free districts. Frost
cuts it badly, but in warm
weather regrowth quickly
shoots from the stems and
butt.
Easily raised from seed
sown in spring, summer or
autumn, according to locality,
the plant roots wherever the
nodes on the stems come in
contact with the ground.
Nodules, which store nitrogen
in the soil, readily form on
the roots. It grows well in
permanent pastures, where the
vigorous growth of the grass
shows benefit from the legume.
Experiments at Kairi
Regional Experimental Station,
started in 1949, with glycine,,
centrosema and other tropical
At the end of the
1958-59 financial year,
the number of regis-
tered sheep-owners had
jumped to 41,101 in
New Zealand. Of this
number, easily the
largest proportion, 9023,
ran flocks between 500
and 999 sheep, while
the next largest group,
6669, ran flocks be-
tween 200 and 499
sheep.
As we can see from
these figures, sheep-
raising must be a very
profitable business. And
one way that ensures
that sheep-raising is kept
profitable, is by using
the proven method of
castrating and tailing

legumes, have shown the pro-
duction of the glycine-planting
as greatly exceeding other
legumes in the trial. Although
ungrazed, this 10-year-old
stand produced nine tons of
green fodder an acre in the
August-December period.
Experimental results and
the practical use. of glycine in
“Say We gate-crash that fancy-dress ball and have a
go at the keg ?”
dairy-pasture have justified
strong support for more wide-
spread use of the legume on
the Atherton Tableland and
areas of similar soil and
climatic conditions. The plant
is nutritious and, though not
particularly palatable, is well
grazed by all classes of stock.
Testing of pasture-combina-
tions with glycine on a large
scale has so far been hampered
by lack of seed-supplies. It
flowers profusely in June and
July and the pods ripen dur-
ing September. Harvesting of
fully-grown green pods will
produce viable seed, so it’s not
necessary to wait for all pods
to dry in the field. Shatter-
ing occurs as they mature and
much seed can be lost. The
seed is about three times the
size of lucerne-seed —about
73,000 seeds to a pound.
Machine-harvesting at Ayr
has shown that an ordinary
header is quite suitable. With
a flail-type forage-harvester,
which can also be used, the
whole plant is harvested when
the seed 'is fully formed, the
material is dried, and the seed
removed by threshing through
an all-crop combine.
For farm-plantings chopped
glycine can be broadcast as
harvested, or it can be dried
before sowing. This saves
cleaning, and the broken
leaves and stems permit easy
distribution of the seed. From
one area harvested in this way
120 three-bushel bags of dry
material yielded 1401 b. of
glycine-seed.
To assist development of the
legume, seed has been distri-
buted to a number of growers ;
it’s also being produced at
R.E. stations at Milleroo,
Ayr, Kairi and Biloela, and
small amounts will be avail-
able for prospective growers,
who may visit the stations
between August and Novem-
ber and collect their own seed
from established areas.

The Elsdon Polwarth stud
was founded in 1935 —origin-
ally Merinos were run there
and a Polwarth flock was
started in 1923. The stud has
had success in the leading Tas-
manian Shows, winning 50
ram-championships: Hobart
Royal, 10; Launceston
National, 13 ; Longford, 14;
Campbell Town, 13. It has
also won seven horned cham-
pionships at the Melbourne
A.S.B.A. Shows since 1952.
Cheviots at Eskdale
John Lyne, of Eskdale,
Powranna, is Federal president
of the Cheviot Sheepbreeders’
Association of Australia and
has just been awarded a
Nuffield Scholarship. As
our leader on the first
day of the tour, keeping us
always up to the minute at
every place we visited, he had
already won our respect for
his efficiency and knowledge.
He even taught us to call his
breed “Cheeviots,” in the
approved Scottish-Border
fashion.
Naturally, we knew We would
find something out of the
box when we visited his pro-
perty. We drove into Esk-
dale 27min. late, and one of
our party had to settle-up on
a wager made the day before
(a shilling to be paid for every
minute we were late in arriv-
ing). Settlement was made in
lottery-tickets to preserve
John’s amateur status!
Actually, what Lyne had to
show us surpassed expectations.
We debussed in the yard,
where granary and stables
(built in 1832 of hand-made
red brick) and white-painted
post-and-rail fences imme-
diately set the tone of the
place. Looking across rich
alluvial flats towards the line
of willows that marked the
South Esk River and to the Ben
Lomond Range beyond, we
could see hawthorn-hedges
planted by the pioneers to
divide the paddocks, continu-
ing the note of trim orderliness
which characterises Eskdale.
The Eskdale Cheviot stud
was founded in 1942 with
sheep imported from New
Zealand and now has a breed-
ing-strength of more than 200
ewes. First Cheviot stud regis-
tered in Tasmania and second
in Australia, Eskdale pioneered
the showing of Cheviot sheep
in Melbourne, Sydney, Bris-
bane and Hobart, and has been
judged most successful exhibi-
tor at Melbourne Royal six
times and at Sydney Sheep
Show four times.
Lyne has entered sheep both
for Melbourne Royal and
Launceston National (a team
of five rams and five ewes at
Melbourne and one of four
rams and five ewes for Laun-
ceston). He has also entered
fat-lambs in Hobart Royal. He
uses a pair of former Hobart
trams to house his show-teams
while they are being prepared
for the Shows. Bought for £4O
each and hauled up to Pow-
ranna on a motor-truck, each
tramcar takes the place of a
building which would have
cost at least £5OO to erect.
Besides this stud he has a
commercial flock of 1100
Cheviot - Merino - cross and
Cheviot-Corriedale-cross ewes,
with 400 ewe-weaners. The
ewes are mated to Southdown
rams for fat-lamb production,
and more than 75 per cent, of
these are sent to market within
16 weeks of birth.

homestead we enjoyed the

Rams at Valleyfield
Seven miles west of Epping
lies Valleyfield, the property
of Robert Reginald Taylor,
famed for its Merino stud
which was established in 1919
on foundation-stock from
Winton.
The property was established
in 1823 by R. R. Taylor’s
great-grandfather, who was 62
when he sailed from Fifeshire
(Scotland) with his wife and
family and travelled in a con-
voy of bullock-drays from
Hobart to take-up this grant
on the Macquarie River. The
first homestead George
Taylor built was attacked by
bushrangers in 1824. The men
of the household drove the
bandits off by musketry, while
the women stood behind them
to re-load their pieces.
The foundation of the
Taylor flocks began when
Merino sheep were first
brought to Tasmania, main
introduction being about 1835
from the Forlonge flock of
pure Saxon blood. The sons
of George Taylor took-up
Winton and St. Johnstone as
well as Valleyfield, and this
pioneer family still own the
original holdings. At present,
R. R. Taylor has established
a stud-farm at Stewarton and
runs this and Valleyfield as
one unit.
There are no Valleyfield
sheep entered for either Show
this year, but the record of
the stud speaks for itself.
Valleyfield suffered badly from
floods this year and, hampered
by the wet weather, R. R.
Taylor explained that he
wasn't going to take us all over
the property. We had a look
at some of last year’s lambs
at Stewarton while he told us
about his rams. The homestead
is the second erected
on the property —all that
remains of the first is an
ivy-covered chimney now used
for a barbecue. It was built
in 1836 from sandstone quar-
ried locally and was originally
designed as a granary and
stables.
The Midlands
The Midlands Agricultural
Association’s Campbell Town
Sheep Show —Tasmania’s top
event —was founded in 1838
and is the oldest Show in the
British Empire with a con-
tinuous history. In fact, the
association is older than the
Royal Agricultural Society of
England and outdated by very
few —for instance, the Royal
Dublin Society (1749), the
Brecknockshire Society (born
1755, still going strong), the
Bath and West (1777) and the
Highland and Agricultural
Society of Scotland (1784).
At Campbell Town we spent
the night in the Campbell
Town Inn, which dates back
to the foundation of the town-
ship, and met lan Nicolson,
Cecil and Charles Parsons at Norton, Mandeville, Gretna.
a councillor of the Midlands
Association, his cousin Ewen
Nicolson, w h o’s assistant-
secretary, and Frank Keach,
of Ross.
Next morning we set-off
along the famous Campbell
Town Straight (the longest
stretch of straight road in
Tasmania and highly esteemed
by young bloods who want to
try-out their cars), and came
to Ross. Here there is the
famous “Four -’Ations
Corner,” bounded on one side
by a pub (temptation), on the
second by a church (salva-
tion), on the third by an
assembly-hall (jollification) and
on the fourth by a jail
(damnation).
Just over Ross Bridge we
came to Mrs. G. W. Reach’s
property, Roseneath, where
she runs a Merino stud
founded in 1947 on a draft of
Taylor sheep from Valleyfield,
Winton and Kenilworth. The
only woman to own a Merino
stud in Tasmania or to sell
at Victoria’s July ram-sales,
Mrs. Keach has had remark-
able success. One sheep from
her stud produced three suc-
cessive fleeces which gained
100 points in 1953, 99 points in
1954 and 98 points in 1955 at
Launceston National. In 1958
and 1959 the stud won the
Hollis Trophy (for the finest
fleece in aged-ram classes) at
Campbell Town, and this year
it took the T.A.A. Trophy.
Show-teams are always small,
this year’s being limited to
two rams and three ewes.
The property isn’t big—only
125 acres, she said —and apart
from 15 acres of lucerne and
another 15 acres sown each
year with Algerian-oats for
forage, it’s laid-down to
improved-pastures. There was
trouble this year in the April
floods, when Mrs. Keach had
to carry some of her rams to
safety through several feet of
floodwater.
Not far from the homestead
are the ruins of an old posting-
station, where they used to
change horses in the coaching
days. The spot is said to be
haunted by the ghost of an
old woman in white stockings
—though Mrs. Keach added:
“I have yet to see her.”

Afterwards we went out on
to the property—originally
70,000 acres, it’s now 10,000—
to inspect the Dennistoun
Polwarth stud, which was
founded by the late B. H.
Edgell in 1909 on Carr’s
Plains (Vic.) stock. This stud
has always been pure-polled,
and is showing three rams and
two ewes at Launceston and
Hobart. Rams from this stud
are also used to maintain Ik
standard of the commercial.
Polwarth flock, whose wool
provides the property’s main
source of income.
The Dennistoun herd of
Angus cattle is the oldest in
Australia, but has never been
registered as a stud because
its records were lost in a lire.
The cattle were brought to
Dennistoun in 1822 or 1823
by Captain Patrick Wood and,
as far as is known, the stock
remains pure.
About 30 per cent, of the
property has been plougne
and laid-down to a pasture-

and past the area which
suffered so severely from
floods earlier in the year.
Interesting features of this
district are the hopfields and

he roadside, protected from
tie wind by their belts of
poplar-trees.
We first visited C. J. Parsons
and Son’s property, Norton
Mandeville, three miles north
of Gretna, where Cecil and
Charles Parsons showed us their
Poll Hereford stud. This stud
was founded in 1958 with five
heifers from S. T. Hawkins’s

(N.S.W.), and a bull from D.

Bill Hamilton, president of
the Hamilton Agricultural
Society, and secretary Brian
Brain met us at Parkfield and
told us a bit about the develop-
ment of the Lawrenny Soldier

the Ouse Hotel and then
retraced our way towards
Hobart.
Chocolate and Fertilisers
Our first visit that afternoon
was to the model factory at
Claremont, where Cadbury-
Fry-Pascall Pty., Ltd., pro-
duce their famous milk-
chocolate, chocolate-bars and
-biscuits, and confectionery.
We were greeted by produc-
tion-director R. A. Smith and
advertising-manager J. W. C.
Wyett, assisted by W. G.
Wells, a member of the
management staff and Miss
D. A. Wyly, who’s in charge
of the women’s employment
section. We toured the factory,
being shown details of the
processes.
Last visit that day was to
the fertiliser division of the
Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Aus-
tralasia’s Risdon works. D. H.
Tuck, who showed us round,
explained the use of sulphur
and sulphuric-acid in the pro-
duction of fertilisers —super-
phosphate and ammonium-
sulphate. We were shown
what happens when the zinc
concentrate is roasted and
sulphur-dioxide becomes avail-
able for the production of
sulphuric-acid, and learned
about the operations of the
company, which now produces
over 100,000 tons of super.
annually.
That evening we stayed at
the Highfield Hotel, Hobart,
where we were the guests of
the Shell Co. and Shell

First visit next morning was
to N. Lucas’s property Mount

the Tassie Friesian stud. The
property carries 52 Friesian
cows (40 of them milked
through the winter), three
bulls, 40 yearlings, 20 calves,

What requirements must be
fulfilled by a wife seeking a divorce
on the grounds of desertion ? How
long do proceedings take and what
is the approximate cost ?
In such a case the desertion
must be without the wife’s con-
sent, without just cause, and must
extend for a period of three years
or more. Proceedings take about
six months if undefended, longer
if defended.
The wife must prove that she
was married; that she has com-
plied with the Act as to domicile
and residence (this is too compli-
cated to explain in full); that she
was deserted for three years and
upwards; and she should have
some witness to corroborate the
fact that she was so deserted and
remained deserted during the
period.
Cost varies from very little, if
she proceeds as a poor person, to
between £9O and £lOO if the matter
is undefended. If defended, it
would be extremely expensive.

What is the derivation of the
expression “furphy”?
The correspondent who asks this
question supplies the origin he has
always believed correct. That is,
that it came from the water-carts
used in the field during War I,
which were made by Furphy.
There is an interesting connection
between the surname and the word
as used to denote an idle rumor.
Joseph Furphy, who wrote for
The Bulletin in the 1890’s, and
who is best remembered for his
book Such is Life, used the pen-
name of Tom Collins, which at
that time meant—an idle rumor!
The term has often been used to
mean a white elephant, and also
it formerly had a suggestion of
the wowser:
Who never drinks and never bets,
But loves his wife and paj's his debts
And feels content with what he gets?
Tom Collins.
Who reads the “Herald” leaders through
And takes the “Evening News” for true,
And thought the “Echo’s” jokes were
new?
Tom Collins.
Eric Partridge says the term
originated from garbage - carts
(made by Furphy) used in
Army camps in Melbourne dur-
ing War I. This seems the
generally accepted explanation.
Army-camp rumors were always
said to originate in the latrines,
and if the night-carts were made
by Furphy then what would be
more natural than to call the
rumors “furphies”? Baker agrees
with this idea, and adds the
interesting information that it was
the abovementioned Joseph Furphy’s
brother John who started the
foundry (at Shepparton, Vic., in
1874) that made the metal-bodied
carts.
Information Supplied
“An Chuidh” writes: “Re the
origin of the word ‘fummy,’
Baker, in Australian Language,
derives ‘fummy’ from fomard,
but to the latter he gives neither
origin nor meaning. However, the
Scottish dictionary gives fumart or
foumart, meaning a polecat.”
Unlike the Celestial Fum (B.
21/9/’6O) the polecat is not a
particularly distinguished animal.
The “pole” part of the name comes
from the French poule, meaning
a hen, on which the weasel-like
beast preys. It lives also on mice,
rats, rabbits, eggs, frogs and
pigeons, therefore does seem a
more suitable ancestor for our
fummy than the mysterious creature
of the Orient.
Brief Answers
A.G.McD.: As such, there is no
White Australia law. White Aus-
tralia is primarily a concept; in
practice a policy based on the
Immigration Restriction Act of
1901 and the Colonial laws which
preceded that Act. Under the
1901 Act any immigrant might be
required to pass a dictation-test
of 50 words in any European
language. Various modifications of
the restrictions that upheld the
principle that non-European people
should not be admitted to Aus-
tralia for permanent residence have
been made, particularly with regard
to the admittance of merchants,
students and tourists, these modi-
fications usually being subject to
a time-limit. Wi ves

REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(22/9/'60)
Queensland should have light rain, mainly below
normal, in October, apart from isolated moderate falls.
However, there are likely to be good rains in much of the
State during November, with best falls along the south coast,
on the Darling Downs and about the Maranoa and Warrego.
There will probably be only light rain along the central
coast, on the Peninsula and in the north-western and far-
western districts.
In N.S.W. there is likely to be moderate rain along the
coast and on the tablelands in October, with light falls else-
where and dry conditions in the far-western districts. There
should be general rains in November, with best falls along
the North Coast, and on the Northern Tablelands and the
South-west Slopes and the plains area there. Apart from
good rains in the northern divisions, rainfall is likely to be
patchy in December.
Victoria should have light to moderate rains in October,
with better falls in November, especially in the northern and
central divisions. In December, though, rainfall will be light
and patchy.
Moderate rain is likely in part of South Australia’s
central agricultural areas and in the south-eastern districts,
but falls may be light elsewhere in the State and it will
probably be dry in the interior. Rainfall will probably be
light in November, apart from isolated moderate falls in
south-eastern districts and along the west coast.
The south-western agricultural areas of Western Aus-
tralia should have moderate rains in October, though rain-
fall may be light in the s.-w.-central north and poor else-
where in the State.

rare chance to hear one of the
greatest conductors of the age
—and one who has been inter-
preting Beethoven for 65 years
—half the time-span the Nine
have been in existence. The
Columbia Symphony Orchestra
performs.
Coronet has also followed
this with another Bruno Walter,
Beethoven Symphony No. 7
(KLC 2700). The Seventh
offers no soul - struggle or
cosmic utterance such as invest
the Third and Fifth. It is one
of the “relaxed” symphonies,
replete with pleasurable melo-
dies and infectious rhythms,
and here Walter pilots the same
orchestra buoyantly through
the terpsichorean labyrinth to
most engaging effect.
Another of Beethoven’s
middle-period efforts, and the
first “programme” symphony,
comes from RCA. In Beet-
hoven’s “Pastoral” Symphony,
No. 6 (L 16249) Pierre Mon-
teaux and the Vienna Philhar-
monic give a glowing account
of the sounds of nature and the
rustic delights which the com-
poser bent so ingeniously to the
symphonic form, complete with
calls of birds, real and imagin-
ary, clodhopping dancers and
a storm that was to breed a
whole stableful of imitators.
The Brubeck Touch
When Dave Brubeck toured
Australia he ,gave pure jazz a
revivifying shot in the arm, the
effects of which haven’t yet
worn away. Usually he plays
his piano with small groups or,
in more serious vein, with big
orchestras. In Cor o n e t’s
Brubeck Plays Brubeck (KLP
866) he does the solo stuff in
nine of his own compositions.
Syncopation is at the base of
all of them, with a dash of nos-
talgia. All listenable, and
smoothly played.

Christmas Pops
Every year brings forth a
fresh batch of Christmas songs,
but most of them fade before
the New Year arrives and are
completely forgotten by the fol-
lowing Christmas. Every now
and then one manages to sur-
vive and is gradually accepted
among the carols and tradi-
tional songs of Yuletide. In
The Merriest of Christmas
Pops (L 10910) R.C.A. has
collected a dozen of these gate-
crashers. Some of them are
now definitely on the guest-
list ; others are still thrusting.
In the former class are Irving
Berlin’s “White Christmas”
(presented here by Esquival and
his orchestra) and the war-time
“I’ll Be Home for Christmas”
(Ray Martin’s orchestra). In
less nostalgic vein are
“Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Rein-
deer” and “All I Want for
Christmas” (with Mimi Hines’s
vocals supplementing Ray Mar-
tin and Co.). Best of the others
are “The Christmas Song”
(Esquival and the Skipjacks)
and the rollicking “Santa Claus
is Cornin’ to Town.”

English Songs
The late Kathleen Ferrier, as
fine a contralto as England has
produced this century, gave a
broadcast - recital eight years
ago of 10 prime examples of
contemporary English song-
making by Villiers Stanford,
Parry, Warlock, Frank Bridge,
Vaughan Williams and Britten.
Collectively they point-up the
resurgence of English song-
composition which had been
in decline ever since Purcell,
and they offer strong contrasts
in their ranging from the sensi-
tive to the virile, with the folk-
motif close to most of them.
This recital was taped and has
now been put on micro by
Decca, A Broadcast Recital
(LWA 5353). Frederick Stone
accompanies Miss Ferrier’s rich
delineations.

Devotional Spot
Seventy young singers from
the Lutheran Augustana
College in Illinois form the
Augustana Choir, which in
R.C.A.’s Favorite Hymns
(CAM 37) delivers with fresh-
voiced fervor, excellent balance
and tone, and volume which
moves from a whisper to full-
throated forte with clear diction
all along the line, 16 of the
best - loved hymns. Among
them are “Rock of Ages,”
“Abide With Me,” the Doxo-
logy, “Lead, Kindly Light,”
“Nearer My God To Thee”
and the militant “Onward
Christian Soldiers.” Henry
Veld, the choir’s founder, is
the director.

White-and-gold was the color-scheme
chosen for the decorations at Ormond
Hall for the Town and Country Ball.
Lilies, gladioli, tulips and daffodils mixed
with greenery were arranged in large
white urns. Hosts and hostesses were
Mr. and Mrs. Rodney Davidson, Donald
Cameron, Fleur Mein, Jim Madden,
Quentin Madden, Anna Jensen, Malcolm
Brodie, Carol Jamieson (president of the
committee), Robin Ritchie, Belinda
Manifold, Donald Richardson and Jennie
Shaw. Guests-of-honor were Oppor-
tunity Clubs chairman A. J. Atkinson,

Greaves and Mrs. Greaves. Proceeds
from the ball were for the Ramsay
Mailer Opportunity Club. Mrs. David-
son’s full-skirted gown was of narrow
blue stripes on- a white-cotton- back-
ground, the bodice of white Swiss-
embroidery. An Egyptian touch was
given to the white-linen sheath-gown
worn by Carol Jamieson by a wide belt
and sash of brilliant multicolored checks
embroidered in gold. Virginia Camp-
bell’s long white French-lace gown was
embellished with tiny bows of powder-
blue satin, Fleur Mein chose pastel-
pink self-patterned satin brocades,
Barbara Davis aqua-blue Swiss cotton
embroidered in blue and yellow roses,
the skirt opening to reveal a yellow
quilted underskirt. Judith Storey’s
bouffant frock was made of rows of
hyacinth-blue nylon-ribbon mounted on
matching nylon. Anne Wilkinson’s
gown of apricot chiffon, cut on Grecian
lines, had opalescent sequins on the
bodice.

Coomaroo, the Toorak home of
Colonel and Mrs. F. H. Wright, was the
setting for the at-home they gave for
English visitors Lord and Lady Kinders-
ley. The hostess wore an apple-green
woollen frock which had the hipline
swathed in a lighter shade of green;
Lady Kindersley pinned a scarlet carna-
tion in the square neckline of her black
silk-jersey frock, which she wore with a
beehive hat of black tulle. Colonel and
Mrs. Wright’s son-in-law and daughter,
Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Marriott, and
their sons Heathcote and Harry, with their
wives were present, as were Lord and
Lady Casey, Sir John Latham, Sir Robert
and Lady Knox, Sir Arthur and Lady
Smithers, Lady Steele (her pretty hat of
lime-green roses swathed in veiling was
worn with a black frock), Mrs. G. I.
Stevenson (in black velvet with a pillar-
box-hat in soft brown), Lady Murdoch,
Dame Merlyn Myer, Mrs. H. F. Cres-
wick and Sir Sydney and Lady Rowell.
Making her first stage-appearance since
she returned four years ago from an eight-
year stay in England, Mary Ward is

In this season’s plastic fashions, seen
during a luncheon at the Hotel Australia,
soft tonings are the keynote. Shown by
Plastalon, raincoats which had the seams
electronically welded to keep the rain
out included those with white back-
grounds, printed with fine pencil-stripes
in various colors, or with tiny checks in
soft blues, greens, greys or fawn produc-
ing the effect of tweed. Two-toned
brown dots on a beige embossed-plastic
produced a pigskin effect. For those who
prefer a bolder note, emerald-green,

The Marillac Centre, which provides a
happy gathering-place for both the youth
and the aged in East Sydney, will benefit
by the October Spring Ball to be held
at the A.C.I. Ballroom on Thursday,
October 20. The Centre is run by the
Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de
Paul, who are familiar to nearly every-
one by their “butterfly” headgear, and
to the many hundreds with whom they
come in contact for their fine, generous
works. Tickets for the ball may be
obtained from Mrs. K. B. Murphy
(Kirrawee) or Mrs. Paul Nelson, 36a
Macleay Street.
Mrs. Ella Westwood, O.B.E., one of
Sydney’s best-known workers for social
causes, is particularly distinguished for
her contribution to the R.S.L., which goes
back to the days of World War I. Then
as a girl of 17, daughter of the T. J.
Allens, of Yass, she threw in her efforts
towards the Bob-In Fund for London,
and hasn’t diminished them since. She
is now president of the women’s com-
mittee of the R.S.L. Combined Services
Sub-Branch and vice-president of the
Anzac House Committee, and she will
accompany her husband, Mr. J. D. West-
wood, early next month, to the National
Congress of the R.S.L. in Melbourne, to
which he is the N.S.W. delegate. Photo

The L. J. Hookers threw a very
glamorous cocktail-party in aid of the
Royal Blind Society through the Black
and White Committee when they opened
the refurbished Carlton-Rex in Castle-
reagh Street last week. It was rather
hard to tell how many guests were there,
for they wandered upstairs and downstairs
and hither and yon, and the cocktail-
party seemed to be everywhere. Mrs.
Marcel Dekyvere, in a cream pure-silk
dress and a huge hat of brown organdie-
flowers, made a speech; so did the
general-manager of the Carlton-Rex, Mr.
J. E. Player, whose wife wrapped a
diadem-mink stole round her shoulders.
Mrs. Hooker wore a black cashmere
cardigan with white-mink collar over a
slim black dress. Mrs. Bruce McFarlan’s
hat of large pink silk-organdie petals
was just like a flower. A feature of the
party was the decorative food. Little
pastry-swans surrounded a large white
swan (potato?), a Polar-bear offered
caviare in a block- of ice, an illuminated
pearl in a huge shell shed lustre on the
oysters, Neptune and mermaids (lard?)
decorated the sea-food savories, and so
on. It was all very skilful and
attractive.

The three finalists in the N.S.W. section
of the Princess of Wool competition met
in Sydney on Thursday, and Miss Robyn
Hayne, of Gunnedah, was chosen, the
equal runners-up being Goulburn’s Anne
McQuisten and Margaret Winn, of New-
castle. Robyn is the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. W. F. Hayne, of Narrawarra,
Kelvin, via Gunnedah. She lives at home
and helps with the station-work, but
doesn’t claim to be able to shear a sheep.
She won £2OO for the semi-finals and is
eligible to compete in the national judg-
ing in Melbourne on October 31. The
chairman of the Wool Bureau, Mr. W. A.
Gunn, and the Director of Promotions,
Miss Nan Sanders, organised the judg r
ing. Anne McQuisten, co-runner-up, is
a Scottish girl only three years in Aus-
tralia but looking forward to making her
life on the land here, as she is engaged
to Robert McDonald, of Goulburn.
Margaret Winn was sponsored by the
Apex Club of Armidale, where she was
living at the time. She is an ex-student
of Ravenswood College, Sydney.

The little black dress was the choice of
the great majority of dancers at the even-
ing at Andre’s arranged by the social com-
mittee of the Opera House Appeal last
week, though the president, Mrs. Marcel
Dekyvere, and the organiser, Mrs. C. G.
Ball, both chose pale-gold shades for
their dresses. But Mrs. Victor Dekyvere,
Mrs. J. N. Kirby, Mrs. George Sample,
Mrs. G. J. Dusseldorp and Mrs. Alex
Slutzkin all chose black. The intimate
atmosphere of a night-club was quite a
change for many dancers, and all had a
happy time. The Opera House will, of
course, benefit.

Smaller homes, to get away from the
institutional idea, are the aim of the Dr.
Barnardo’s Homes today, Mrs. Rupert
Scammell told guests at the at-home and
musicale held at the Royal Common-
wealth Society’s rooms for Dr. Bar-
nardo’s during the week. This is to
increase the feeling of family-life that
is so important for the child’s sense
of security. Lady Woodward was guest-
of-honor at the party, where the musical
programme, arranged by Mrs. Harry
Twigden, was provided by contralto
Yvonne Minton, baritone Robert Colman
and pianist Enid Partridge. It was
interesting to see that Robert Colman
later in the week won the Melba
Memorial Challenge Trophy for the
men’s vocal competition in the City of
Sydney Eisteddfod.


country rectory seems to have come
from reading rather than from life ; the
long dialogue of the deadbeats in
Trafalgar Square is a purple passage
of the most self-conscious kind ; the
plot creaks with contrivances ; hardly
any of the characters come alive in
their own right or relate truly to one
another; and the argument of the
book, as Christopher Hollis has pointed
out in detail, is confused and uncon-
vincing. True, other early Orwell
novels suffer from such failings, but
none so badly as this one.
The heroine is Orwell’s only attempt
at a full-length portrait of a woman.
This is Dorothy, the self-torturing girl
who loses her memory, presumably
through overwork in her insouciant
father’s parish, and goes off hop-pick-
ing with tramps ; recovers to find that
a scandal built round her sudden dis-
appearance has cut off her return ; and
then, after some weeks of dreadful
dossing and begging, becomes a teacher
in a cheap private school, where she
remains until the scandal is cleared.
Although by now she is aware of hav-
ing somehow lost her religious faith—
the only justification for her slavery in
the parish—she decides that she can-
not break with the habits of belief ;
refusing an offer of marriage because
she hates physical contact of any kind,
she returns to the rectory, prepared to
go through the motions of faith because
parish work provides her with a shelter,
however grim, from an intolerable
and meaningless reality. Beliefs do
not matter:—
The trivial round, the common task
Will furnish all we need to ask.
This, then, is the “message” of the
book ; and it is a message the later
Orwell must have disliked even more
than the way it is argued. It is hope-
lessly confused, however, with another,
more important purpose : to evaluate
the effect of such terrible destitution
as Orwell himself knew when down and
out in Paris and London on a particu-
lar kind of character—one of shabby-
genteel upbringing who has a nagging
sense of guilt and an incurable incapa-
city for human contact.
Out of this uneasy mixture of pur-
poses the heroine emerges as a sort of
half-abstract illustration for a sermon
and a half-human victim of experience,
disappearing behind Orwell the essayist
so often that in the end we can no
longer believe in her.
It is no contradiction of all this to
add that “A Clergyman’s Daughter”
is well worth reading. Orwell’s fail-
ures have a way of being more interest-
ing than many another writer’s suc-
cesses, and not one of his books lacks
its share of excellent pages. In this one
we have the lively and graphic des-
cription of hop-picking in Kent; the
bitter comedy of life in the swindling
private school; Orwell’s usual com-
pelling thoughtfulness and concern for
human suffering; and, running all
through it like an undercurrent that
sometimes rises memorably to the sur-
face, a unique sense of loneliness—
the loneliness of one who is cut off from
the familiar world by terrible exper-
iences and is searching for a way back.
Island Entertainment
John Murray has reprinted Arthur
Grimble’s A Pattern of Islands in a
paperback with a romantic, not to say
lurid, cover of girls and palmtrees
which may increase its sales —if any
increase' on 450,000 is really necessary
—but which conveys a somewhat mis-
leading impression of the nature of
this fine book ; for if the story is
romantic enough in some of its idyllic
pictures of the natives and their love-
affairs, especially that of the prisoner

she was ill and then stole away to his

Penguins
A preface by Mary Campbell—very
well written and reminiscent for more
than one reason of the prefaces which
Mary Shelley wrote for her husband’s
verse after his death —has been added
to the Penguin Classics edition of Roy
Campbell’s translations of the Poems
of St. John of the Cross. It contains
a beautiful description of the old vine-
shrouded house in Toledo where they
lived in 1936 and from which Roy
Campbell met the Carmelite writers
who had investigated the lives and
texts of St. John of the Cross and
St. Teresa.
The outbreak of the Spanish Civil
War, in which his friend and con-
fessor Father Eusebio was shot in the
first few days, interrupted Roy
Campbell’s Spanish studies and it was
not until after he came back from
World War II that, “in a few months
of incandescent effort,” he did the
present translations.
But, however much this preface, with
Father M. C. D’Arcy’s illuminating
introduction to St. John, may predis-
pose the reader in favor of the little
book, it cannot be said that Roy Camp-
bell translated St. John successfully.
One does not need much Spanish to see
that there is a softness of language
and rhythm in the original which is
lost in Campbell's rather mechanical
versification. Compare
En una noche oscura,
Con ansias en amores inflamada,
Oh dichosa ventura!
Safi sin ser notada,
Estando ya mi casa sosegada
with
Upon a gloomy night.
With all my cares to loving ardors
flushed,
(O venture of delight!)
With nobody in sight
I went abroad when all my house was
hushed.
And if, as undoubtedly was the case,
there was that peculiar sunlit radiance
of the mystic in St. John such as we
find in the poems of Blake and Tra-
herne. Campbell was rarely able to
reproduce it. He is at ease only in the
more sensuous imagery of Nature and
love, particularly in “Songs between
the Soul and Bridegroom,” which is
most in accord with his own poetic, if
not his religious, view of life:-
O thickets, densely-trammelled,
Which my love’s hand has sown along
the height:
O field of green, enamelled
With blossoms, tell me right
If he has passed across you in his flight.
Women in Love, one of five additions
to the Penguin list of D. H. Lawrence’s
work, is often said to be his best
novel. Certainly his perceptions of
social and personal relations were never
more intense than they are in this
study of the loves of two Midlands
couples; nor were his anti-intellectual
values ever stated more richly, both in
direct terms and in symbols (it con-
tains the famous chapter describing
the attempts of the hero —a self-por-
trait—to shatter with stones the reflec-
tion of the moon in a pond).
The other Lawrence additions are
The Ladybird, containing the cele-
brated “Captain’s Doll” and “The
Fox” as well as the title-story; The
Trespasser, a rather young second novel
about a tragic affair between a married
man and one of Lawrence’s “over-
conscious” young women; England,
My England, a collection of early
stories, including the superb “Monkey
Nuts” and “Tickets, Please”; and
Twilight in Italy, travel-essays which
are all still very much alive.
Other recent Penguins and Pelicans
include; a selection of the poems of
Lorca (Spanish text with prose trans-
lation) by J. L. Gili; Came a Cavalier
by Francis Parkinson Keyes ; The Day
of the Fox by Norman Lewis ; Why
Evil? ; a Biblical Approach by John
James ; A History of Modern Japan
by Richard Storry; The Silver Sword
(Puffin) by lan Serraillier; and The
Hatter’s Ghosts, a non - Maigret
Simenon.
Fifty Pounds for a Dead Parson:
David Scott Daniell (Cape). Rustic
horseplay and murder in 19th-century
England. The novel is said to be based
on true happenings around 1805, when
a country parson quarrelled with his
parishioners over payment of the tithe
and was shot dead in broad daylight
by a jobbing-carpenter who hardly
knew him. Love-interest is stretched
to the limit and the old-world touch is
self-conscious and overdone. Inciden-
tally, the definition of village hierarchy
seems inaccurate. Who lived in the
great house and preferred Parson
Parker to his living?
