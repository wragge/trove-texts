“ Not the same as others."
Right from the time it first was used to cover a roof, Malthoid has proved its
undeniable superiority over all others.
Malthoid figures in specifications where durability and economy are demanded,
because architects have learned from experience which roofing is giving the
best service and is most satisfactory to lay.
No weather conditions affect Malthoid —neither heat, cold nor wet can -reduce
its efficiency.

Simple and Effective Methods.
By Olga Ajisdell, Special Correspondent,
London, Eng.
The Killing of Superfluous Hair.
It is easy to remove superfluous liair tem-
porarily, but to remove it permanently is
quite another matter. Not many women
know that for this purpose such a simple
substance as powdered pliemiuol may be
used, applied directly to the hair. The recom-
mended treatment is designed not merely to
instantly remove the hair, but also to event-
ually kill the roots entirely. Almost any
chemist could supply an ounce of plieminol,
which quantity should he sufficient.
Renewing Complexions by Absorption.
If your complexion is marred with sallow-
ness, moth patches, pimples or freckles, it is
useless to potter with powders and paints,
lotions, creams and things In an effort to get
rid of the trouble. Unless you have some
ability as an artist, you will mar your ap-
pearance still more. The new and rational
way is to take off the complexion itself, with
all its offensive marks. Just get some pure
mercolized wax at the chemist’s and use at
night the same as 'cold cream. Ilemove next
morning with water and soap, following with
dash of cold water. The mercolized wax
absorbs the half-dead scarf skin in flaky
particles, so gradually that no one guesses
you are treating your face—unless it be by
the result, which is truly wonderful. There
is nothing like it for bestowing a natural,
healthy and beautiful complexion.
A “Blackhead” .Secret.
Blackheads, oily skins and enlarged pores
usually go together, but can be instantly
corrected by a unique new process. A tablet
of stymol, obtained from the chemist, is
dropped in a tumbler of hot water, which will
then of course “fizz” briskly. When the
effervescence has subsided the face is bathed
with the stymol-charged water and then dried
with a towel. The offending blackheads, of
their own accord, come right off on the
towel, the large oily pores immediately con-
tract and efface themselves naturally.- There
is no squeezing, forcing, or any drastic
action. The skin is left uninjured, smooth,
soft and cool. A few such treatments should
be taken at intervals of thi-ee or four days
thereafter in order to insure the permanence
of the pleasing result so quickly obtained.
Don’t Have Grey Hair.
Grey hair is often a serious handicap to
both men and women while still in the prime
of life. Hair dyes are not advisable because
they are always obvious, inconvenient and
often down-right injurious. Few people know
that a very simple formula, which is easily
•made up at home, will turn the hair back to
a natural color in a perfectly harmless man-
ner. You have only to get two ounces of
tammalite concentrate from your chemist and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum to prove
this. Apply this simple and harmless lotion
for a few nights to the hair with a small
sponge, and the greyness will gradually dis-
appear. The lotion is neither sticky nor
greasy and has been proved over and over
again for generations past by those in pos-
session of the formula.
About Shampoos.
To quote an eminent London beauty
specialist: “The slimy egg cannot dissolve
the scalp impurities, but only adds to the
trouble by completely choking the pores with
animal matter.” The substance sticks, de-
composes, thereby causing the hair to assume
a dead, “dull color.” Avoid eggs (and soap
tool on your hair. Try the delightful pre-
paration made by stirring a teaspoonful of
stallax in a cup of hot water, It will bring
out new beauty possibilities in your hair,
will clear and prevent dandruff, and leave
that fine fluffy effect so much sought after.
It also removes excess oil or greasiness. [1

Bulletin takes your fancy, write to the

The Red Page
THE POET’S HOME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The rich man sat in tasseled ease
And read the poet's lines.
Strange songs of wonderlands were these,
Where, reaved from teeming mines
The virgin gold held crystal lamps,
And gold gleamed softly red
From ivory stairs, and marble ramps,
And chair, and gracious bed,
And glut of riches strew the mart,
The hall, the home with sumptuous art.
He read, of one white palace raised
In shelving gardens where
Quaint ivory nymphs their satyrs praised,
And sleepy pearls, more fair
Than maidens’ tears, were eyes for fauns
Of silver preciousness,
And little deer stepped on the lawns,
With ruby chains to dress
Their sleek, faint limbs, mid orchids’ gleam
As strange as faces in a dream.
And down the poet's page there wound
The march of ladies sweet
In diamonded fabrics bound,
With sapphires to their feet,
And lace-clad men with dainty airs,
And mares with sheen of silk
And opal gleam in matchless pairs,
And, mincing, white as milk,
The, hounds in gilded thongs at play
Tinked tiny silver bells all day.
The rich man rose, and went to seek
The poet’s poor abode,
Where spread the gutter’s feetid reek,
And sprawling in the road
His slattern children screamed and fought,
And from his scolding wife
The rich man straight the singer brought.
“Come, know the regal life,
The sweet of ease and wealth,” said he,
“And write the rare, rich verso for me."
The poet sat in green brocade,
Ho drained the golden bowl,
And vagrant little rhymes he made,
AVith not a note of soul.
The poet ate the rarest meat,
He saw the ladies tall
■ In shining robes, with little feet,
And tried to sing of all.
His song no pulsing rapture bore,
And presently he sang no more.
The poet saw the glow of gold,
The alabaster moon;
Each prize of art was his to hold—
He dozed before the noon.
The rich man took his hand again,
And by the hovel’s grime,
The squalling brats, the evil lane,
He set him down betime.
“Now God forgives, for I have led
You back to glory, friend!” he said.
VICTORIA.
EDWARD DYSON.
In the Fourth Year
Quite a library of literature about the end
of the war is growing up—literature about
the time when peace shall blossom afresh, and
Armageddon shall become a bee-farm, and the
tank shall lie down with the lamb. H. G.
Wells’s book isn’t the worst of the collection
by a long way, and he is a good, far-seeing
democrat in spots. He holds, to begin with,
that the horrors of war are really just begin-
ning. If man goes on devising implements of
destruction he will yet produce a tank that
will run like the east wind with an ostrich
shoving behind, and flatten out a century of
civilisation as it goes; and he will float a
fleet of airships which will blot out a metropo-
lis in one act if it happens to get there before
the opposition fleet, knows that it has started.
The speed of these craft will bring every big
city in Western and Central Europe within an
hour or a few hours of every other city, and
distance being destroyed the crowding
together of enemies will be intolerable. So
he outlines a very promising Federation of
Free nations —those that are republics, or
monarchies whore the king is only a life
president under another name'. It is not a
League he proposes, but a real Federation,
with a central Parliament which will control
the _ joint armies and navies and the
foreign policy, and keep peace inside
it 3 boundaries and have its own rev-
enues _ and its own President. Also,
which is most essential, it is to control, as a
sort of common property, like Canberra or
the Northern Territory, all those colored
possessions, such as Morocco or India or
Papua, or the one-time Hun Africa or the
Congo, which show no sign of being able to
run a republic on sane lines. They may be
held in trust after a fashion for their old
owners, but there are to be no tariff
wars or boundary wars among them; they
are to be managed by Federal troops and
police and officials, and no State is to arm
and train its nigger so that he may fight
against the other white man who owns the
other nigger.
Mr. Wells has a wholesome contempt for
kings; for royal marriages mostly with Ger-
man princes and princesses, which make all
royalties cousins barring Mohammedan
ones; and for the old dry polite supercilious
professional diplomatists. These latter he
especially scorns as the men who make
secret treaties like a lot of boy Fenians who
take a tremendous oath in a cellar and patch
up stillborn arrangements like that of Ber-
lin, where nobody knew the boundaries of
the different races they dealt with and
nobody except the Turk, who didn’t count,
knew the Balkan languages, and one at
least (Disraeli) was alleged to have never
seen a map of Asia Minor. Charles Lever
only drew a life-like character occasionally,
but his Lord Culduff, in “The Bramleighs of
Bishop’s Folly,” was alive —or at least not
more, than half dead. Wells’s description
of Victoria as tin l grandmother of Europe is
good, and his demand that sovereigns, if
there must be sovereigns, should marry
among their own people is eminently sen-
sible.
In contradistinction he shows curious
limitations. As a writer of books he carries

Today they’re friendly rivals.
Both have many friends ; both

All Westclox alarms are built

You’ll like Big Ben and Baby

The way to radiate happiness
is to he happy—the way to be
happy is to cultivate good health
An easy way to cultivate good health and happiness is to acquire
certain simple habits of life. The Kruschen Habit is a simple
habit—it is quite simple to drink a tumbler of hot water with a
half-teaspoonfui of Kruschen Salts in it every morning on rising
for a few weeks at a time. Yet this simple habit makes for
health and happiness as nothing else does—for it cleanses the
system, purifies the blood, and tones up x mind and body to the
acme of efficiency. “ The difference between an optimist and a
pessimist ”, it has been well said, cc is a dose of Kruschen
Salts ! ” Get the Kruschen Habit—persevere with it—and
prove this saying for yourself. It is the safe, sure road to health
and to the happiness that health confers.

“Wind Up.”
Long have I stood in the welter and thick
of it,
Braving the terrors and heat of the fray.
Sloshing the Hun till the blighter grew sick
of it,
Girt up his loins and skedaddled away.
Nor was I discomposed much by the bieeze
Kept it controlled with the greatest of
ease.
When my brigade suffered terrible losses,
When I was bathed in an ocean of gore.
When I earned dozens of all sorts of Crosses,
Choc’late-box ribbons and medals galore.
Did the wind rise with me? Perish the
thought!
Weather conditions behaved as they ought.
But came a time when my limbs lost their
virtue,
When my whole Cosmos was one aching
tooth.
When the dread slogan, “I’m not going to
hurt you”—
Slogan unloved in the Fountains ot
Truth —
Sapped my whole manhood and plunged me
in gloom.
Then rose the wind and accomplished m.\

There shall be no more waiting through the

For any written word of his again
That tells of peril passed, or victory’s gain.
And long as love and life and memory stays
There shall be no more watching through the
haze
For homing ships, with eager eyes astrain.
For all the shining sweep of ocean ways
Are set between us two, who loved in vain.
There shall be no more dreaming when the
dusk
With brooding wings falls grey, and com-

Of what the might of marching years may

Are folded in and buried deep with tears
Where memory stays with mignonette and

Dusk, and a little wind.
And a network of leaves across the moon;
Song and the shreds of an old-world tune
From the walled-out world behind!
Night, and a face inclined
To the dear deep blue of the plumbless sky;
Small stray waifs of the wind that sigh
Spent lives out in the grass—
So shall our own lives pass!
Shadow and stars —and, in shadow set,
The star of your cigarette!
Dark, and the web of night
Woven of all things old and new
(Changeless, ephemeral, strange as you!)
In the loom of the Infinite!
Starshine, and sharp delight
Of joy so deep that its deepness grieves!
Silence that holds in the silvered leaves
Fragments of all life gone—
So shall we pass anon!
These all, and, set in the midst thereof,
Life and a little love!
Screened in the leaves, and thus
Smitten with light, and with flecking shade
On his lifted arm and his white loins laid,
Turning his face from us
Poises Discobolus!
And there, in the fathomless pools of shade
By blackened boles and the lush grass made,
Slipped from the flesh, could I
Bodyless, drown and die
Only for you, who have rendered dear
All that has kept me here!
Showing in faint vignette
Glimmers your face from the nearer shades,
As, with your slow breath, flames and fades
The glow of your cigarette:
So, in my body set,
Hope that is life, or despair that is death.
Waxes or wanes with the beat of your
breath.
There is a love that spells
Pain—could I love it else?
Knowing the price, shall I scruple to pay?
Give me your lips—and stay !
Lean on my palm that slips
Under your head, while my eyelids kiss
Your own closed eyelids, and all that is
Trembles to white eclipse,
Slain on your eyes and lips.
Warm are your throat and your arms that
cling.
Broken the words of your whispering;
Fetter my body fast!
So would I die at last.
* * * *
Time sleeps—and there in the long grass yet
glimmers your cigarette!

Dodge Brothers
MOTOR CAR
It is about four years since it first became known that Dodge Brothers
would make complete motor-cars, instead of manufacturing essential automobile
parts, in gigantic volume, for others. The news travelled rapidly in the
automobile trade, and was received with an interest and respect that was
almost inexplicable, considering the limited circle to whom Dodge Brothers
were known by direct contact. Before Dodge Brothers themselves announced
anything concerning their car, thousands of Agents, including the shrewdest
and most important in all parts of U.S.A. and foreign countries, had applied
for territorial rights—because of the conviction that if Dodge Brothers were
to make automobiles, those automobiles would be “right.”
The progress of the Dodge Brothers’ Car throughout the world represents a
record achievement in the Automobile Industry.
This is the answer to those “Wise men of the East” ; those astute dealers from
near and far, who were able to see clearly into the future of a car conceived
and manufactured at the Dodge Brothers’ plant.

LATEST NEWS FROM THE SKY.
The coldness of Postmaster-General Web-
ster about the matter of airships as
carriers of mails, passengers and possibly
freight is the kind of frost that isn’t to be
wholly applauded nor yet wholly condemned.
The country doesn’t want Webster to rush
headlong into aerial navigation, for it has
never considered that rushing was his line
of business. It believes he and his colleagues
would rush with more expense than capa-
city. Also it is bound to consider that any
Government which seems possible among
their opponents would be a great deal worse,
and that State Governments and possible
State Governments are much the same, if
not more so. It is 50 years or so since any
Australian Cabinet had to seriously con-
sider the cost of public works, for the giddy
old loan, aided at times by the giddy old
land-sale money, paid the bill; so the habit
of efficiency and economy, died before most
current politicians left school. The instinct
wasn’t born with them —in fact the contrary
instinct was born with. them—and it is no
more inherent than deep drainage was in-
herent in a Hebrew nomad of the wilderness
period. Then P.M.G. Webster isn’t a young
and skittish experimentalist. He is too
mature to burst in haste out of an ancient
rut. Still the country must get out of the
ancient rut in time.
Air shipping is plainly the coming
device. It has advanced so fast dur-
ing the war years that a man who hasn’t
gone on a very recent tour of inspection only
knows of it in the same hearsay fashion
which he uses when knowing about the bones
of the megatharium. One of the things we
are aware of is that the express pace of the
sky-train is 90 miles an hour faster than
it was four years ago. and assuredly no
earth-train lias increased its. .pace from 60
to 150 miles an hour in the same time, or
any other time. It can easily travel at a
height of 10.000 ft. in the search for a calm
sea, which is several times the height con-
sidered feasible in an ordinary way when
the war commenced, and no steamship reaches
that elevation or shows any sign of doing
so. It is actually in use as a mail-carrier
in a small way. So many thousands of
machines are required for war purposes that
there are few to spare for other uses; still
the Briton and the Frenchman haven’t our
lazy idea that everything should be put off
till the war is over. Hence the noon mail
closes in Paris at 12.50 p.m. and letters are
delivered in London at -3.20 p.m. The
I. nited States, Canada, Italy and Sweden
also , have air-mails of a preliminary sort.
The mail-birds don’t necessarily drown if
they fall into the sea, being built also for
sea navigation. There are parcel and pas-
senger air-services in the Mediterranean
despite the war, for the lifting-power of big
machines has increased greatly and is still
increasing. The clipper of the clouds has
been used to take food and ammunition to
the front line when these essentials were
wanted much faster than they could be sup-
plied along the roads. A proposition has
been advanced by a great manufacturer in
the United States for putting 10,000 extra
aircraft into the service by some time next
year, and sending them across to the war
zone by their own power. Such a new force,
thrown into the scale, would be capable of
blotting out Hun cities at the rate of one
per day and making a sudden finish of the
weary business. In fact things are moving.
The airship is the only means of locomotion
which seems to have unlimited possibilities
ahead of it, for the prospects of the two-rail
train appear to be pretty well-known, and
the sea leviathan is already disqualified in
three-fourths of the world’s harbors. A
cheap express-train that will climb over the
Himalayas or across the African desert, or
a feasible Titanic that will float on the
Parramatta River, don’t seem possible. Still
less does an express train that will travel
on the Parramatta River or cross to Maori-
land seem possible, or a big steamer that
will economically climb the Blue Mountains.
The amphibious airship is willing to take
on both contracts, laying its permanent way
as it goes and carrying its tunnel under its
arm, and making its harbor almost any-
where as if it was an aboriginal camping
out. In fact it is willing to finish, at a day’s
notice, the great connection across Australia
from north to south, which has been an un-
finished concern and a sink for money for
over 30 years.
It is not good for P.M.G. Webster
to hasten too much or to hasten with-
out intelligence. He might commit the
country to crude and expensive experiments.
Also it is not good for Webster to hasten
too little, for even now Australia is spend-
ing as much as £14,000,000 a year (though
the scarcity of loan money has temporarily
reduced the pace) on very expensive and
often _ very crude and disastrous railway
experiments. Many of these railways—per-
haps all of them—may be scrapped before
the people now living, are all dead. And
though the building of railways can’t be
wholly suspended pending the arrival of the
railway’s successor, still that arrival
shouldn’t pend (at ruinous cost) a moment,
longer than necessary, evetu-jf WeTISFeR is
tired. Pjanding isn’t a cheap business, for
toe unsuccessful railway is a fixed loss; it
can’t shift from one route to another like
the ship—air or otherwise. Of course, air
navigation will be fought to the bitter end,
and ridiculed and contemned and misrepre-
sented by the Big City interests, for it will
be the end of the great congestion monopoly.
All the railways of a State can be made to
converge on Melbourne or Adelaide or Syd-
ney. But the crows of a State can’t be
made to fly to the Big City and nowhere
else, and the airship is a crow on a big
scale. What the new order requires is a
Postmaster-General who can fly, or at least
soar, in his imagination.
THE INEVITABLE USUAL.
As is usual —in fact it is so usual as to be
almost invariable—the thrilling feature of,
the N. S. Wales financial statement is the
public debt. It is now £142,508,693 (on
paper it is £10,076,000 more than that, but
a loan of that amount is repayable in Sep-
tember and the new loan to repay it with is
already on hand). So the progress of recent
years has been as follows: —
.Debt
N.S.W. debt. per head. Interest.
1910 ..£92,525,095 £56 13 2 £3,250,129
1913 . . 106,170,747 58 13 4 3,786,842
1916 .. 130,514,018 70 6 0 4,848,967
1917 .. 138,138,346 73 13 9 4,916,203
1918 .. 142,508,693 76 0 0 5,502,355.
(Estimate)
1919 . . 146,008,693 78 1 1 5,731,000
The debt per head for 1918 and 1919 is
rather in the way of an estimate, for popula-
tion isn’t a thing that can be calculated to
a day ; but the gross amount of the debt and
the gross interest bill are official figures.
The rate of interest goes up as well as the
total amount: —■
. Rate or Interest.
1910.. £3 10 3 p.c. | 1917.. £3 16 1 p.c.
1913. . 3 11 4 „ | 1918. . 3 17 3 „
1916.. 314 4 „ | 1919.. 3 18 6 „
So the Ma State’s credit was getting worse
even before the war. Now the deterioration
is likely to go on even faster. The State
had this great luck, that in the early years
of the war, when interest began to go up,
it had few old cheap loans falling due to be
renewed in a very high-priced market. But
in 1917 nearly £5,000,000 fell due, which
was bad. This year nearly £13,000.000 fell
due, which was worse. There are over
£11,000.000 repayable in 1919; an average
of about £5,000,000 per annum in 1920, 1921,
1922 and 1923: and in 1924 close on
£17,000,000 has to be borrowed to repay a
debt that now costs per cent. If the
interest rate is even 5 per cent., then that
one operation will add over £250,000 a year
to the public liabilities, and if the rate is
5h per cent, it will add £340,000 a year. Yet
there won’t be a copper more loan money to
spend.
Treasurer Holman is frank and explicit
about the awfulness of.the debt burden. He
divides the bill into interest on loan money
invested in business undertakings (“perma-
nent and reproductive works”), and interest
on loan money invested in things that aren’t
yielding, and never were expected to yield, a
copper—-the thinsrs that represent the shirk-
ing of lazy, dishonest, pampered folk who
wouldn’t pay enough taxes to cover their
ordinary bread-and-cheese expenses. The two
items appear thus :
Actual Estimate
1917-18. 1918-19.
Interest on money spent on
works which profess to pay
their way, but don’t quite
do so £4,412,701 £4,670,000
Interest on money spent by
way of pure swindle .'. 1,089,654 1,061,000
£5,502,355 £5,731,000
As regards the first lot the case is put in
this way: There is £257,299 more interest to
pay (the estimate will probably be exceeded)
in 1919 than in 1918 upon money invested in
business undertakings (railways, tramways
and sundries). In return for this the net
return from the business undertakings is
expected to increase by £28,736. Conse-
quently the new interest earned is roughly
one-ninth of the new interest pa*W, which
looks like paying £3 18s. 6d. and earning
6s. 9d. per cent. That is the “reproductive”
element of the case which is bad. The “per-
manent” element is possibly worse. Of
course a great many of the works are in the
nature of monopolies which can be made to
pay more or less by shoving up charges.
N. S. Wales is still borrowing for schools—•
which aren’t supposed to yield revenue, but
rather add to the bill for repairs—for dredg-
ing rivers, and for small vague things which
the statistician lumps together in his haste
as “all other purposes.” But that sort of
thing always happens.
Premier Holman isn’t unduly sanguine
about the N. S. Wales railways and tram-
ways :—■

That makes five years’ railway loss of
£1.201.768, less five years’ tramway profit of
£172,413. Net loss for five years, £1,029,355 :

1916 ..Loss 137,457 (Estimate)
1917 .. „ 403,991 | 1919 .. „ 404,132
So 1919 is expected to be a record year for
badness. Comparing the actual results of
1915 with the expectation of 1919 it seems
that the increase of earnings is £2,160,429 ;
the increase of working expenses is
£1,658,684; and the increase of the good old
interest bill is £972,681.
* * * *
So in five years things grow £470,936
worse. There were seven good years—l9o6
to 1912 — which ended as soon as the Hol-
man crowd got into its stride and began to
lash out. While there were surpluses they
were spent gaily. Dreary economists might
have bought up Government securities with
them in the open market —securities of any
Stete whichever happened to be cheapest—
and supplied the Railway Department with
a reserve which would supplement its in-
come, but the idea of a reserve would be
contrary to all N. S. Wales precedent. Rail-
way charges have been raised of course—by
aboiß 10 per cent., as compared with 25, 40
and 50 per cent, war increases in Canada,
the U.S. and Britain. The rise is only about
half enough to meet the emergency, but then
it is a rule in N. S. Wales to never more
than half meet an emergency, the theory being
that the Australian has only half the cour-
age of any ordinary person. The freight
charges were cut down about 50 per cent,
between 1895 and 1911, so the 10 per cent,
now put on is a mere trifle. Some countries
might have thought it absurd to sacrifice
revenue like this while it professed that it
couldn’t pay for a yard of new line without
borrowing the price of it, but there seems to
be a law against not borrowing in Australia,
and a Treasurer who is short in his defici-
ency is considered dishonest. As a side issue
it has been asserted that each year 2,000,000
tons of N, S. Wales freight are dragged 100
miles further than they need go in "order to
be exported from Sydney instead of from
some other place, the extra haulage being
thrown in at a great reduction or almost
gratis to prevent people complaining too
much. This fully accounts for the railway
deficit.
THE HUGHES WE ARE USED TO
AND THE HUGHES WE GET
NEWS ABOUT.
Supposing W. M. Hughes does come back,
after all the bombast and hot-air that have
surrounded him in England, someone. will
almost certainly be waiting for him on the
wharf with a dead cat. A dead lion would
be sufficient to express the situation, but
dead lions are scarce. W. M. Hughes,
unless he is wholly changed, has grown to
the dimensions of a direct insult to the coun-
try which handed out his absurd salary
and fed his monstrous vanity. His
frantic appeals for Protection —high Protec-
tion ; real strenuous Protection—in the Cold
Country mean that he really Relieves in Pro-
tection, unless, of course, it can be imagined
that lie has been manipulated to lure
Ma to her undoing. And what Australia,
waiting .on the wharf with the cat clasped
to its bosom, has to ask him is just this:
Seeing that he knew what was the right
thing to do and left it undone, was it
because he hated Australia and wanted to
do it every injury in his power? Or was it
because he thought it safer as regards his
billet and his remuneration to leave the
tariff alone?
Hughes has orated greatly in Buli/s
Country about the energy and fore-
sight of the Hun, who only started
building his big industries in the eighties of
last century, and in one man’s lifetime made
his country the second-greatest of the world’s
manufacturing centres, with a fair show of
being the very greatest if he hadn’t gone mad
in 1914. He has quite justly held the
Hun up to admiration for his indus-
trial policy. With incredible assurance
the Prime Minister has roped in laurels
by preaching the heroic gospel in Eng-
land and allowing people to imagine that
he is also the industrial super-man and
the dauntless prophet of progress. And
there is talk of raising a great subscription
so that this colossus of politics and tower
of strength and walking Rock of Gibraltar
may remain in the mother-land and hold
up the Empire presumably with his cheek.
Australia, the country that has liquidated
his political salary for 24 years, got in
return a flabby drifter in the ways
of imported shoddy, a non-committal person
who sank the fiscal issue. And Aus-
tralia, standing in readiness with the animal
already indicated, fully expects to get the
same sidelong apologist back again.
**• * *
England only knows Hughes talking at
large with no responsibility for carry-
ing out his programme, no portfolio at
hazard, and no electors to placate. And
England will probably remark in sadness,
when it hears of his reception here, that a
really great man is wasted on the unappreci-
ative “colonials.” Which will be rough on a
nation which has been buying a Stentor or
Boanerges ever since 1894 and only get-
ting an irritable little man of shifts and
devices, always nearly making up his mind
and never quite succeeding or else unmaking
it again. If the Commonwealth can onlv
hope for a return of the Hughes it is used
to it would be worth while to make him a
present of Australia House or the Canberra
Federal territory to stay away.
THE LOST SPIRIT OF CORTEZ AND
COLUMBUS.
The Premier of Victoria, at the One Big
City of Melbourne, being moved out of his
usual complacency by public or newspaper
comment, lately invited local bodies of one
sort and another to explain why all Victoria
except Melbourne is dying. He appealed
to municipal bodies, shire corpses, progress
associations, also probably to retrogression
associations and Y.M.C.A.’s and Shak-
speare societies and agricultural shows.
Their replies were of many dull and unenter-
prising kinds. They talked of lack of rail-
way facilities (when there are already far
more railway facilities than can pay axle-
grease) ; the closing down of country indus-
tries (without any reference to why they
closed down) ; the scarcity of roads (yet
there are good roads on which it is possible
to walk 10 miles without striking a human
habitation) ; and the existence of big estates
(despite the fact that the people with small
estates are selling out). And nobody in all
A T ictoria, not even the president of an out-
back brumby racing club, told the complacent
man in Melbourne that the curse of Victoria
is Melbourne itself, just as Sydney is the
curse of N. S. Wales, and any other soli-
tary bloated city is the bane of its sur-
roundings.
In every country population tends to con-
gest. round the big, busy seaports. Thus
the population of the counties of London
and Middlesex is about 40 times as dense
as the average of England, and that of
Lancashire three times as dense, and the
population of Lanark and Mid-Lotliian and
Renfrew beat the general average of Scot-
land about sixfold. The tendency to con-
gestion in coastal cities is aggravated when,
as is the case with Australia, the coast-line
is absurdly small as compared with the area
of the country. It is especially aggravated
where the richest mineral deposits are close
to the coast, and where the real interior is
scarce of rain and almost devoid of rivers.
And when, added to these natural tendencies
towards coastal congestion, certain fool
Governments get control of the railway sys-
tems and deliberately manipulate them to
force the population, that would otherwise
spread around the shore, into three great
cities, there isn’t much left for the rest of
the country to do save go bankrupt and
perish. To dwellers in the three great cities
this may seem rather desirable than other-
wise, but to anybody who loves Australia as
a whole it is a lamentable business. Aus-
tralia wants a decentralisation policy more
than other countries, because of its size and
its shape and its climate, and it has less of
it than any other country. In England,
much smaller than Victoria, it is reckoned
that centralisation is overdone because
almost half the population is crowded into
five widely-dispersed counties. In Scotland,
much less than half the size of Victoria,
half the population is condensed into four
widely-separated counties, and that is con-
sidered excessive. In Victoria, as in S.A..
more than half the population is in one city
-—not a county, but a blob inside a county.
And that city is eating up the outside popu-
lation, whereas in England and Scotland,
which combined are about equal to Victoria
in size, the nine crowded counties, bad as
they may be, are not devouring the remainder
of the people. They leave something over
for their neighbors.

The difference lies mostly in the railway
methods. In Britain railways belong to
joint-stock companies. This is democratic
in a sense, seeing that anybody can buy
shares in the companies with his own money.
In Australia the railways are public pro-
perty, in the sense that everybody owns a
share, bought with money borrowed from
somebody else; in other words, everybody
owes for a share. The joint-stock railways
have to scramble for a living on their own
merits. They can't afford to deliberately
ruin a good harbor like Portland or Cardiff
by refusing it communication, or by giving it
ridiculously circuitous communication, or by
killing its trade with hostile freights, merely
because the larger populations alongside
some inferior harbor like Melbourne or Lon-
don want it done and have hold of the
strings of government. On the other hand
the State-owned railways, or rather the
State-owed-for railways, do such freaks be-
cause the congested people alongside the
inferior harbors don’t mind making the whole
system a loss, so long as they make a little
special gain, they being able to tax the
whole community to make good the loss.
State ownership of railways as practised in
Australia is a great curse. It would be a
great blessing save for two things: That
the railways are really owned by a knot of
money-lenders who draw a guaranteed divi-
dend from them in good times and bad ; and
that they are managed by a knot of city
politicians in the interests of six cities,
which are only six spots on a very big


map. The country districts get just the
same as the nigger slave did on the old
Carolina plantation. Sambo’s allowance
was enough to keep him alive and fit to
work profitably for his owner. When he
ceased to be profitable the death of Sambo
didn’t matter.

Australia, as already suggested, is a coun-
try with very little coast for its size and
very few harbors for its size. Experience
shows that population will accumulate if
within reasonable distance of a good har-
bor and provided there is reasonable access
to that harbor. Hence population grows in
the county of Cumberland (N.S.W.) and
the county of Bourke (Vic.). Hence it
would grow in other places if Australia was
divided into 20 or 30 States, each with a
good harbor as its outlet. But these States
must have their own opportunity and make
their own future. There is quite a differ-
ence between the Constitution that a nation
makes and maintains itself and the one
that is handed out to it by a benevolent despot
who alters it or takes it back when so
inclined. .-Melbourne and Brisbane made
themselves by breaking away from Sydney.
Tf they hadn’t broken away they would have
been what Grafton (N.S.W.) and Portland
(Vic,) and Albany (W.A.) are to-day—
mildly patronised by an overwhelming
parent, given as much encouragement as is
safe without allowing them the ghost of a
chance to compete against the overwhelming
parent, patted on the head by condescending
politicians from the overwhelming parent,
and pulled up short by some new harbor or
railway regulation issued by the overwhelm-
ing parent whenever they threaten to be
really alive. When a Hohenzollern or a
Hapsburg or a Premier at Melbourne cir-
cularises his unprosperous outlying sub-
jects, asking them what he can do to make
them happy, the only possible answer is
that he can tie a grindstone to himself and
his party and the policy they represent, and
fall overboard en masse.

In this matter The Bulletin holds a brief
for certain persons who don’t buy the paper
because they don’t exist; who don’t advertise
in it because they have nothing to advertise;
who don’t vote for it or its ideas because
they aren’t born. It takes up the cause of
the people-who-might-be in the desirable
empty places where at present there is
nobody. In that respect it admires the enthu-
siasm, misguided though it might be, of
Peter the Hermit, who urged folk to go to
Jerusalem though he had no corner allot-
ments to sell there. There is some pleasure
in trying to re-awake the colonising spirit
which died so very young in Australia. When
a handful of people with a continent on their
hands and about a century of national exist-
ence lose the craving to go out and found a
new city—the craving which made Cain in
the year 133 go forth and marry a monkey
and build Baalbec, of which the ruins still
remain—then it is ageing too rapidly. Its big
cities have got it down and are sitting on
its chest.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Billy Hughes’s Bill.
Txie voluble Prime Minister of Australia
has made trouble in England by becoming
defendant in a big libel suit —thank goodness,
it wasn’t a breach-of-promise suit!—and the
less voluble Acting-Prime Minister has
promised that this country will pay the
costs (which are certain whoever wins)
and the damages (which aren’t cer-
tain, but possible). This paper fails to see
why Australia should pay anything. When
a Government sends out an ambassador,
either with special instructions or with a
general order to do the things that ambas-
sadors are created for, it accepts certain
responsibilities. One is to stand by its repre-
sentative to the utmost of its resources if
he gets into trouble in the legitimate pur-
suit of his job. Another is to face the bill
if he gets into trouble by exceeding liis
instructions, and going outside his job;
though it may recall him and disavow his
act, it pays for the breakage, if any, and
looks as dignified as it knows how. This,
however, has no visible bearing on the
present case. Hughes, the noisy, and
Cook, the comparatively silent, weren’t
appointed by the Government. They
were the Government, in effect, or
the top-end of it, and appointed themselves.
They weren’t exactly ambassadors or en-
voys—they were not even Agents-General
for Lord Howe Island ; Andrew Fisher is
our ambassador. They were-—or at least
the more talkative of them was : —supposed
to have an invitation from the British Gov-
ernment to meat and drink and consultation
on public affairs, which might give them a
sort of diplomatic standing, but nothing was
said about elocution, nor about gymnastics or
exhibitions of musical talent. Even the
instructions they gave to themselves didn’t,
so far as the public was allowed to know,
include verbal fireworks and large conver-
sation in public places—and the pursuit of
the bubble limelight on the platform’s
mouth. If a person is sent, or rather goes
without being sent, to patch a ship or to
consult about patching the ship of State,
and he gets into difficulty by using tender
language towards a girl in a garden, or
harsh language towards a male in an office, it
is hardly the shipowner’s affair. W. M.
Hughes was an individual who was absent
from his regular job, with full salary, on
leave granted by himself, he having gone
away for indefinite and expensive purposes.
Being accustomed ever since 1894 to talk
largely under shelter of Parliamentary pur-
poses, he grew excited with his holiday and
said things without Parliamentary privi-
lege about some rich and allegedly Hun
business people which they had to resent if
they didn’t. want their business damaged.
What he said might be true; but anyhow
Australia didn’t know that it had despatched
him to disseminate truth to all and sundry
regardless of expense, he, being the sole
judge of what was truth. It didn’t know
that it had despatched him at all. But it
knows now that Hughes was never an am-
bassador of any sort, for silence is the ear-
mark of the ambassadorial tribe. If Aus-
tralia makes itself responsible for its windy
Prime Minister’s sayings it takes on an
indefinite order. He may have supplied
material in his meteoric-career for a dozen
actions which didn’t eventuate until now
because he wasn’t considered worth powder
and shot. When it is known that he has
Australia behind him, including the Treasury
balance and the note reserve and the funds
of the Commonwealth Bank and the bor-
rowing powers, almost anything may eventu-
ate. Ghosts may arise in all directions,
likewise “shyster” lawyers. Supposing he
has to stay in England to meet them all
Australia may be deprived of the blessings
of Hughes for a very long time, especially
if he uses actionable language whenever a
new case turns up. Probably the wisest
course would be for this country to wire
Hughes to start for home instantly under
the name of Smith, in order to avoid being
intercepted by further writs, and to add
that if he isn’t here by December 1 his bil-
let will be filled. And having got him out
of the United Kingdom it will be time to
intimate that all proceedings against him
will be undefended, but that damages and
costs will come under a special " Hughes
Moratorium Act. postponing payment till
after the war —not this war. but the one
between San Marino and Hedjaz, which may
happen at almost any moment.
About an Adulteration Law.
"Henry IJorsecollar” offers a suggestion:
I wish to propose the establishment of a new
crime—one that will supply a long-felt want. My
idea is a heavy penalty for the supplying of false
information —provably false information of course.
I wouldn’t arrest or summons and fine or imprison
people who promised a Millennium or a fresh develop-
ment of the Beast of Revelation or said there was
a Hell, or that there wasn’t a Hell, or declared
that the whole community would die of drink, or any
vague Iscariot or optimist of that sort. I wouldn’t
drop—not under this law anyhow—on anybody who
dealt in denunciation of any kind. If there was a
Law of Blither it would be somebody else’s law, not
mine. But
Well, I have heard a Foreign Shoddy orator heap-
ing scorn on Protectionists by comparing them with
a Chow emperor who built a great wall round China
in order to keep out trade. It was his favorite
example, and he was always using it. Probably
he is still using it. Yet he knew he was a liar,
and he was injuring the community by garbling the
only fact concerning China that many of them ever
knew. There never was a wall round China, and
the wall along the northern border was a fortification,
not a trade barrier. That man ought to have been
fined £5O, and double for the second offence.
I have read articles in allegedly intelligent Sydney
papers telling that Captain Cook was the original
discoverer of Australia, in consequence of which
readers knew less of Australia than before. - I have
known frantic parsons who said that millions of
people died in Australia through drink —more people
than die in the country altogether; also one frantic
parson who saw about a dozen intoxicated children
emerge from one Sydney pub in one evening and
who wouldn’t name the pub. I know of a Laborite
who declared, contrary to the land and income-tax
returns, that one-sixth of the people of Australia
owned all the wealth, while the "other five-sixths
owned nothing and paid all the taxes. Likewise
one who supplied bogus recruiting statistics, to
prove that the places which were mostly inhabited
by artisans supplied almost ail the recruits. Like-
wise, again, quite a crowd who declare that the
accumulation of big estates is going on apace in
this country.
In the days when the Commonwealth was in the
making there were wild geebung politicians who
assured the community that during the bank-smash
days N. S. Wales kept Victoria afloat by sending
over immense lots of gold to it, when the trade
returns showed that the flow of gold was the other
way. As for liars who declared that Dalgetv was
in Victoria, close to Melbourne, and was a breach
of the blessed Constitution, they were legion.
As regards thousands of such eases where matters
of easily provable fact are concerned, and provided
the statement is made in print or in writing, or
by word of mouth in the presence of five or more
persons, I would allow anybody to lay a charge of
adulteration —adulteration of the truth and contami-
nation of the fount of knowledge. I would make
the minimum penalty <£lo, half of it to go to the
informer.
The prevaricator who ' diffuses false ' statements
does it for profit or out of inherent viciousness.
Either way, he is corrupt and a nuisance. He is
an opponent of education and helps to make our
costly education system null and void by tearing up’
useful information and sowing misinformation in
its place, as he might rabbits or cactus. He is an
offence against the anti-shouting principle, because
he shouts falsehood as other men shout drinks. . He
would probably shout drinks as well as falsehood
only he is too mean to pay for them. His object,
when he has a definite object, is to Cause people to
do something under the influence of the drug of
deception which they wouldn’t do if they weren’t
drugged. In this respect he is in the same category
as the keeper of an opium joint which has a house
of ill-fame attached. He distinctly comes under
the Adulteration law; also under the law against
getting value by false pretences and selling cotton
as silk, for he is after value of some sort—the
money taken at the door or a seat in Parliament or
something.
Of course there would be talk about interference
with free speech, just as there is about interference
with free blasphemy, or free stealing, or free inser-
tion of chicory in the coffee, or the free sale of
opium. But I don’t really object to free speech.
All I suggest is that when a man professes to start
with matters that can be proved or disproved, they
should be concrete and not sand. Otherwise whatever
advantage he gets in cash or kind out of his oratory
is confidence trick and wild-cat and sneak-thievery.
No writer or exhorter whose text can bear inspection
could possibly object. He would bo pleased, for
when the deceptive scum were eliminated competi-
tion would be reduced and the survivors would carry
more weight. They would be hall-marked as genuine.
Let everybody speak as freely and as long and as
often as he likes, only let him confine his falsehoods
to his inferences, and not outrage the Building Act
by putting in a jerry foundation.
My law would save much expensive paper; promote
accuracy of thought; and lead to an increased sale
of books of reference.
A Semi-detached Brick Cottage.
On a Saturday afternoon N. S. Wales Min-
ister James, who means well, went to St.
Peters (Sydney), which isn't much of a
place, to lay the foundation-stone of a semi-
detached brick cottage which is to be ulti-
mately occupied by a returned soldier. It
is one of two semi-detached brick cottages,
which are to be ultimately occupied by two
returned soldiers. How much the function
cost the community this present writer
doesn't know. The Holman Government is
great on small functions, and it never can
see, that they are a senseless and purpose-
less and undignified dribbling away of
money. Among its expenditures for the
year which ended on June 30,1917, were two
guineas for a bouquet to a lady at a concert,
£32-odd for a reception to the wife of the
Prime Minister, whom everybody concerned
had seen before, a few shillings less than
£5O for a supper to a blessed or blamed old
opera company. Also £194 went in open-
ing the Sydney Zoological Gardens, not
with prayer, but with food and drink. So
it was quite natural that Minister James
should go to St. Peters, with pomp and cir-
cumstance and (presumably) expense, to lay
the foundation-stone of a semi-detached
brick cottage. The Holman Cabinet is
capable of going all the way to Menindie
ta lay the foundation-stone of a fish-trap or
a beehive. In fact, Minister James had
another engagement to open a new academy
at Denman, after which he was to go on to
Merriwa, where the people are asking for a
new academy; and similar engagements
were simply pouring in. And Minis-
ter Ball. was booked to go to
Corowa to open a show, or something.
Likewise Minister Geahame had a date to
open a show (and his mouth in oratory) at
Gilgandra. These matters have no direct
bearing on tin fact that last year the Min-
istry razzled away £122 on laying a founda-
tion-stone at Narrara, and £l2 on a feed
to the students at the superfluous State
aviation school —superfluous because aviation
is a war device just now and war isn’t the
State Government’s job. Anyhow Minister
James went to St. Peters to lay the founda-
tion-stone of a semi-detached brick cottage,
and spoke with eloquence about the war.
Mutcii, M.L.A., belongs to the crowd which
demands that when we have won the war
we should give back to the beloved Hun all
his lost colonies, including those that are
almost within gunshot of Australia, and not
charge the valued baby-murderer a penny for
damages; and Mutch, being present, joined
issue with James over the foundation-stone
of the semi-detached brick cottage. In fact,
there was unseemly recrimination round and
about the foundation-stone of the semi-
detached brick cottage, and the politicians
almost spilt foam upon it. It wasn’t exactly
a case of scuffling on the steps of the temple,
as Edmund Barton used to put it, but a
certain amount of dust was raised at St.
Peters, which is dusty enough at all times.
Some people are inclined to think that this
fussy little foundation-stone laying is
beneath the dignity of a portfolioed and
salaried Minister of the Ma State of the
Australian continent—in fact, that we should
learn to think in continents and not in
counter-lunches. But a Cabinet which spent
£194 in opening a bear garden, and then
£2141 on sending children to see the bear,
lacks the capacity to recognise a joke. It
doesn’t even recognise the humor of a highly-
important Minister being squabbled at and
barked at and cat-chorused at by a dis-
gruntled new-chum private member in a
dusty suburb with their feet spread among
the untidy beginnings of a. semi-detached
cottage.
“Wonga” : N. S. Wales, at time of writing,
is again suffering a shortage of butter.
This is becoming chronic about this period
of the year, and it is nearly time that mat-
ters were better adjusted. The spectacle of
a country exporting huge piles of frozen
butter for one portion of the year, and its
own people being compelled to go without the
same product, although willing to pay a
good price for it, during another portion of
the same year, is novel but mighty
inconvenient. The outstanding feature
about the present shortage is the igno-
rance of the Sydney press on the
position, and the easy way it has
allowed its leg to be pulled by the
Sussex-street crowd. According to the lat-
ter, there have, day after day, been only a
few hundred boxes of butter available for
the trade, when in actual fact the Federal
authorities have simultaneously been releas-
ing thousands of boxes for distribution.
Consequently while the public have been told
by the newspapers that there was only
about 25 per cent, of the normal supply
available, there has been nearer 50 to 75
per cent. When Hughes made the last
butter deal in England lie'financed it upon
the definite assurance of the whole trade
that sufficient butter would be reserved for
local consumption summer and winter. The
co operative people appeared to have kept
to this bargain and advocated reserving
60,000 boxes for the winter trade, but Pirate
Enterprise, who is now filling the
papers with bluff intended to fix the blame
elsewhere, hedged as usual for the sake of
an immediate profit, and only 35,000 boxes
were put aside. Now there is a shortage,
and had the butter sold, but unshipped to
Great Britain not been available the con-
sumers would have gone very short. Which
all shows that something more than “assur-
ances” are required, and in future years the
authorities should make no mistake about
seeing that the consumers and grocers—who
are having a rocky passage these days—get
a fair deal, and not be left the plaything of
a few big agents.
What happens to the chop and steak be-
tween the time the animal leaves the grower
and the retail customer gets something to
eat has been explained many times. W. E.
Abbott, of Wingen (N.S.W.), explained
some more the other day in a letter to Syd-
ney Herald. From this it transpired that
Abbott sold “a very prime lot of bullocks”
to a freezing company. After deducting the
value of the by-products the sale price
panned out, on the company’s own state-
ment of weights, to 44d. per lb. Abbott
then tested the retail end through his Syd-
ney solicitor, who at a shop which drew
supplies from the company he had sold to,
was charged on a cash basis Is. 6d. for
steak, Is. 4id. for roasting pieces, and Is. Id.
for ribs. Having communicated the facts to
the Price-fixing Department, it was sug-
gested to Abbott that his solicitor had been
charged more 1 than the usual shop rates. To
test this he procured the weekly bills of a
customer at the same shop, and found the
booked charges still higher; fillet steak being
2s. The circumstance that meat went up
in price nearly 300 per cent, within a week
of delivery at the slaughtering-pen suggested
to Abbott that a community, which allowed
itself to be looted so thoroughly was getting
the sort of treatment it deserved, and that
talk about victimisation by producers
was mere blither. This about sums it all
up. Hitherto the machinery of meat distri-
bution has been controlled by a ring of
wholesale operators, who have made enor-
mous profits out of the grower and the con-
sumer. To some limited extent —and that
only—the existing price-fix and the libera-
tion of frozen meat hampers this ring. But
it does no harm to remember that prevailing
prices are exorbitant and that they are based
upon a schedule which was really framed by
the Meat Ring. They are a good 75 per cent,
more than were levied in the year before the
war—and it was by no fair bidding for sup-
plies that the lift happened.

The Federal Government has engaged Pro-
fessor H. Maxwell-Lefroy to put in a
year at least in this country investigating
the blowfly, prickly-pear, St. John’s wort,
woolly aphis and grain weevils, pests which
are costing Australia more than the in-
terest on the national debt yearly. In addi-
tion, in his spare time, the Professor—he
is admittedly one of the world’s leading ento-
mologists—is to inquire into the possibility
of establishing the silk industry in the Com'
monwealth. Lefroy came out here some
months ago on behalf of the British" Gover-
nment in connection with the wheat purchase,
and in a few’ weeks evolved methods which
have meant the saving of enormous loss to
the wheat country, by instituting better
stacking methods and introducing cleaning
machines. For this he has never got the
credit he should have, more especially as he
had mighty little assistance from sundry
State departments and politicians, who
allowed petty jealousy to influence them.
Lefroy is to get a salary of £3OOO and ex-
penses, with £2OOO for experimental work
and a staff. If he secures as useful results
iu handling the blowfly and prickly-pear as
he did with the wheat weevil, this will be
the cheapest proposition Australia has
struck. Likewise it would mean a mint of
money to Victoria to get rid of St. John’s
wort, a weed introduced into the Bright
district years ago by a German nurse, who,
it is alleged, used it for illegal purposes (it
causes abortion). The pest has spread over
and absolutely ruined a heap of good, rich
counti-y, and is still going strong. It has also
obtained a footing in the Ma State. As to
the blowfly and prickly-pear, they seem be-
yond the scope of mortal to deal with effec-
tively on a large scale; but Lefroy is no
stranger to flies. He was sent out to Mesopo-
tamia by the British Government to fight
the insect which was playing havoc with
the troops, and succeeded in reducing the
admissions*of disease cases to the hospital by
06 per cent. Launcelot Harrison, of Syd-
ney University, has been carrying on the
good work over there since. Incidentally,
Lefroy is a noted specialist in the silk
industry.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The English dead number 900,000.”
I.
Nine hundred thousand Englishmen have
died
To keep the splendid faith of all the years
Since freedom hurled her heart against the
spears
Of Prussia’s millions in the battle-tide
That rolled through Asian conquest to the
wide
Green fields of Europe. Oceans of hot
tears,
Rivers of blood and nights of conquered
fears
Cry to the world that force forever lied.
Force and man’s faith, ini battle knee to knee,
Have striven for the mastery of earth
And filled a thousand valleys full of graves;
But, blown upon the trumpets-of the free,
The call rings through each newer age’s
birth
Of faith that wins and holy truth that saves.
ii.
Nine hundred thousand graves! The bridge
is made
Across the black ravine of man’s deSpair,
A bridge of awful death, yet rising fair
In sculptured sacrifice that, unafraid,
Dared the red lightning and the reeking
blade
To arch with hope of life that awful air.
It is a bridge of death, yet everywhere
Life walks where death the deep foundations
laid.
Across that bridge shall happy music run,
Light-footed, in the golden days to be,
Filling the rich, wide future with a song.
All men shall find their places in the sun,
Reaping a harvest of the land and sea,
And children laugh with never thought of
wrong.
in. V-
. hundred thousand dead! Oh, wide
young eyes
That looked upon the horror stark add cold !
Of all their deeds the half has not been told.
Who bore the weight of our vast enterprise.
Old are the Fates—ah, old and very wise.
On their red counters are the great years
sold;
And these have paid, paid the immortal gold.
Of their grejt youth in splendid sacrifice.
Shall it be counted- vain-? Nay, while one

The Spreading Bloodstain.
There is certainly, no steeplechase about the
German move backward in the West, but
the push against him is steady and .persist-
ent. There also seems considerably more
method about the proceedings on the Allies’
side than was the case in previous opera-
tions. Gaps are being bitten into the
enemies’ lines here and there, the corners
knocked off and the biting resumed at a
fresh place. The result has been a gradual
general advance into the old-time battlefield
of the Somme, with the British troops imme-
diately south of Arras, on ground that was
bitterly contested before Flindenburg’s
well-remembered flit of a couple of years ago.
The arithmetic relating to the capture of
German prisoners has been getting rather
mixed lately, but, even after allowing for
duplication and repetition, it seems to be
clear that no such hauls-have ever before
been made, and that the volume of war
material and number of guns taken make a
record. If the reported accounts of the pro-
ceedings on Haig’s front are reasonably
correct, there appears good ground for sus-
pecting that, while the German is delaying
the advance, lie is busy preparing an anchor-
age for himself, and that it is into the old
Von llindenburg line he will subside for
the winter. Meanwhile north and east of
Boissons he is threatened with serious
trouble, involving the safety of the line he
now. occupies, thence along the Vesle to
Rheims. Some dramatic happenings would
be certain if the French make any substan-
tial advance in this quarter, since an enemy
retreat to the old line above the Aisne would
be jeopardised. A flaring up of the battle
along the Vesle and an intensification of the
lighting beyond Soissons are quite possible
happenings before many days have passed.
A couple of months of good campaigning
weather yet remains. The news filtering
through from Germany since Foch com-
menced hitting back is as unilluminating as
ever. The few juiceless snippets available
from time to time have a drearily familiar
sound and little, if any, meaning. This is
not a particularly encouraging sign, at any
rate. for people who comfort themselves with
the idea that the German is on the verge of
casting off the chains that bind him to the
llohenzolierns or that he is publicly
giving three jeers when Ludendobff ex-
plains when the next victory is going to
arrive. Yet though the solidarity of the
German people may remain unimpaired and
miracles of organisation may have been per-
formed, it would be incredible if, after spend-
ing four years on the bread-line and watch-
ing the evaporation of continual assurances
of overwhelming victories, the German citi-
zen was not finding the Fatherland a very
cold and cheerless place. And it would
be still more amazing if, after what has
happened this summer and contemplating
America’s uninterrupted arrival, the Kaiser’s
relatives are not beginning to reckon that
his wolfish thirst for gore ought to be nearly
satisfied.
The Occasionally Good Meat of Sydney.
The gruesome report of Bracket, K.C.,
Royal Commissioner on the subject of Syd-
ney's meat supply, reveals the existence of a
middleman who wasn’t taken into account by
the meat-fixer. The Homebusli abattoirs,
which represent the best part of a million
of borrowed money and show very small
cash results —some years they show no cash
results at all—are described as a very dirty
and diseased and expensive muddle. The
concern is new. but it seems to have been
born old. For lack of quite a lot of things
that such a place should have the amount
of good bullock that goes bad there is terri-
ble. The recognised waste in the meat trade
comes under a number of headings. There
is the loss on the station, which varies.
Outback, especially in drought time, it is
heavy, but in the worst places and the worst
years it never exceeds 100 per cent. There is
loss on the roads, especially on the long road
from North Queensland to Sydney ; loss in
railway trucks, especially if the way is long
and slow and hot; loss through condemna-
tion of diseased cattle; loss through the meat
that goes bad in the shops, particularly
when trade is slow and flies are fast. And
it appears that the lug abattoirs, which
should be above suspicion at the price, have
themselves gone bad. If retail prices are
based on the fixed cost at the saleyards and
reasonable fixed allowances for slaughtering
and distribution, while no allowance is made
for perhaps Id. per lb. that has to be paid
for stencli and decay, then there is a big
hole in the calculation. The Commissioner’s
report may be summed up that Monday’s
meat is very likely to be bad, having been
from 43 to 58 hours getting into a state of
decomposition; that the other days’ meat
hasn’t decomposed so long; that out of
1,000,000 sheep slaughtered last year 500,000
went bad in parts—the parts that are called
fries; that the chilling-rooms aren’t cold
enough; that the hot old-fashioned waggons
that carry around the food are accompanied
by blowflies, and so on. This loss can’t be
charged back to the producer, for the food
was able to stand on its four legs when he
sold it. So it is divided between the middle-
man and the consumer. The stench that is
so bad as to be unsaleable is the middleman’s
loss. The stench that is still saleable and
only reaches its complete development in
the kitchen-safe or the pot or the stomach is
the consumer’s loss. One thing is certain :
if the price-fixer got his ideas at a place like
Adelaide, where the abattoirs are up-to-date
and meat is delivered in insulated waggons,
and if he made arrangements for Sydney on
documentary evidence and without studying
the local blowfly, then he didn’t give Sydney
a fail- deal. The blowfly ought to be charged
to the working expenses of the abattoirs.
The Police and the I.W.W. Haul.
From a table in No. 3 Court:—
N. S. Wales Parliament having passed legislation
arming the Royal Commissioner with wide authority,
Justice Street was handed the job of inquiring into
the charges brought against the police in connection
with the I.W.W. arson-conspiracy charges, on which
a dozen men were convicted at Sydney a few months
ago and sentenced to long- terms of imprisonment.
The inquiry opened last week and the rush for seats
filled the court in record time. The evidence on
the first day made a full house certain on the second.
Pura, a tailor, was put into the witness-box and
explained some of the circumstances incidental t°
making suits for half a dozen detectives who had
been connected with the I.W.W. business, payment
therefor being made by the Goldsteins. As Davis
Goldstein had been mixed up witH the note-forgery
cases and the I.W.W. trials, and had made a sensa-
tional statement regarding the police, this testi-
mony of Pura’s had a tasty flavor. Next morning
the mail steamer arrived from ’Frisco, and when
Street took his seat the call rase: “Henry Christo-
pher Scully.”
H. C. SCULLY , chief witness at the Royal
Commission following the I.W.W.
convictions.
A little man, quietly waiting behind the barristers’
table, walked into the witness-box. He was, as
it transpired, to be there for 12 hours. This was
Scully, the pharmacist, principal witness for the
Crown against the men now in gaol, perhaps the
inost-talked-of man in Australia during the last few
weeks—a 6mall man of middle age, reddish and
slightly bald. Sea-ail- and sun had tanned his skin.
A citizen of the inconspicuous, indefinite type this —
quiet, plausible perhaps, and very careful. The kind
of man to he seen behind a thousand counters and
forgotten.
He takes the oath with prodigious solemnity.
Windeyer, K.C., appearing for Judd, Mutch, Brook-
field, opens with some questions about what hap-
pened at ’Frisco and leads up to the famous “state-
ment” furnished by Scully to Judd—the basis of
the charges and these proceedings. The statement
is read. It is an amazing document. In it Scully
traverses the evidence of every material witness for
the Crown at the trial —except himself. Windeyer
takes him over the ground in detail. Scully qualifies
and discounts everything. He insists that his state-
ments were not charges—they were mere suggestions
for inquiry, theories, comments, speculations about
what he then thought the whole truth might be.
He was not a literary man; the wrong word had
been used; the onus of proof was on Judd—and so
it went on, for hours, With Scully always ready
with an answer—never flustered, calm, deprecatory,
precise. It is not often a witness goes through
such an ordeal. It is seldom such a witness as
Scully is in the box. He stood the best part of
three days of it. At the end he nearly collapsed.
Little wonder.
Then came Davis Goldstein, whose statutory
declaration about the trial and the police was in
Windeyer’s hands. A different sort of customer this
—loud, truculent, intolerant of cross-questioning.
Goldstein is a Jew, stockily built, swarthy skinned,
with a forehead coming well down upon his counte-
nance. Not an ill-favored Hebrew by any means; he
looks like an Italian, but is not oue. Street warns
him that immunity from prosecution may depend
upon the view taken by the Commissioner of his
evidence. Windeyer suggests that the warning
might, perhaps, be given more fully. “There is no
necessity,” Goldstein shouts. “I’m here to tell the
whole truth.”
Windeyer: “Very well. Up to Saturday you were
ready to make a certain statement”
Goldstein: “Up to Saturday I was prepared to per-
jure myself.”
He says this at the top of his voice, shaking his
head with passion. Street warns him to control
himself, and repeats the warning several times later
on.
Goldstein -flatly denies having said various things
suggested by counsel. Coming to matters which
cannot be denied he declares them to have been untrue
—that his statutory declaration was a lying statement.
The Commissioner wants to know whether Goldstein
realises what kind of individual he is making himself
out to be. Goldstein says he does —and the judicial
eye rests coldly on him. The gravamen of Gold-
stein’s trouble is said by himself to be the fact that
he lost £4OO through the police failing to arrest
a person he had gone bail for after h£ had warned
them that this person was about to bolt. He speaks
hotly on the subject, and makes resentment justifica-
tion of his allegations against the police. ; A strange
witness.
Louis Goldstein, a brother, is called. Quite a
different Goldstein—more Hebraic, more deliberate,
a slow thinker. He weighs each question a long
time and answers slowly. There may be more of
him later. Meanwhile the original statement made
by Davis Goldstein, on which most of the cross-
examination turns, must not be published.
There seems a probability that this inquiry may go
quite a long way. There is certainly not much doubt,
anyhow, that the public is going to hear a lot yet
about the I.WAV. prisoners. Some of these men are
married. Their wives sit in the court listening to
the evidence with strained faces and mournful eyes.

“Bad Australian”: For several years past
the Japs have been very active in Argentina
and S. America generally, and since the in-
auguration of a direct line of their steamers
to Buenos Aires their business interests have
increased in a phenomenal manner, so much
so that Nippon has decided to found a per-
manent embassy in the Argentine capital.
Japanese goods and Japanese agents are now
to be found in all parts of the Republic, and
the little man with bis cheap and showy
stuff bids fair to oust the European and give
Uncle Sam a run for the market. The pre-
sent state of mind in official circles is
decidedly antipathetic to the British and
French capital invested in the country, as
witness the fatherly attitude towards the
murderers and incendiaries engaged in the
constantly recurring strikes on the railways
and freezing works. In the circumstances
it looks as if Japan is likely to become top-
dog in S. America, and considering how much
the two peoples have in common there
appears to be nothing to prevent a peaceful
fusion of the races. With the European the
case is entirely different—he is, and must
always remain, a stranger within the gates.
Let his political, religious or commercial faith
be what it may, lie can never become a South
American nor of the South Americans.
It is a joke at the expense of the great
natural resources of the country that music,
singing and elocution should be among the
things taught to returned soldiers who re-
quire a new occupation. They seem futile
and unproductive and overcrowded lines of
industry. Still, as we can’t get the wheat
and the meat away for want of ships, and
the Sydney match-factory and the principal
wooltop-factory have closed up, and many
gold-mines are doing the same because the
imported machinery is scarce and ruinously
expensive, and the woollen-mills are also in
difficulties because of the imported machin-
ery famine, and the knitting of socks has
almost ceased because the wool that was
sent to England to be made into yarn hasn’t
come back yet. and the tariff and the War
Profits tax kill new industries on sight—-
considering these and many other things,
time hangs heavily on our hands. So the
returned soldier may as well warble for an
idle hour about the boy on the burning deck
while he waits for some industry to start.
We haven’t the dec-k, pending the arrival of
the imported materials to make it with, and
there is lack of the match to burn it with, but
anyhow, we have the boy. He was last
seen selling the evening paper at a busy
corner.
“Mujik" : Iu the remote past I bet a curate
a new tile that before the war was over the
.voice of the Pharisee would be heard whis-
pering to the Democracy to help pay its bill
by having a game at Fiji Uncles with the
old-age pensioner. And 10, brethren, it has
been even so. Wherefore shall I journey
forth on the morrow to warn a ,meek and
lowly worker in the vineyard» to raise
14s. Gd. For has not Melbourne Age
(21/8/T8) risen up in horror to point
to “specific instances of the necessity for
economy,” and directed a shaky finger of
scorn at the invalid and old-age pension?
The method of the Age is heartful. It enu-
merates the nation’s vast debt and the expen-
diture on this thing and that. It wants to
know how much longer the jag is going to
continue, demands to be told whether the
distribut ; on of fat billets is to persist till
the last trump reverberates at Ooclnadatta or
somewhere adjacent, and pleads for economy
It goes into the pensions arithmetic to
show that the figures are leaping sky-high
Then, having finished with the poison-bottle!
it unctuously winds up :
We do not suggest here that in view of the
troublous times ahead these pensions should be abol-
ished or even curtailed, but we do submit that thev
are the strongest possible justification for the inline-
diate introduction of drastic economies in eveiv
branch of Government not connected with the war
It is no use disguising the fact that unless this step
is taken these pensions and many other of our
privileges will be in a position of the greatest
jeopardy. There will simply be a repetition of the
old story of the straw' which broke the camel’s back.
The implication here is that when the numer-
ous Governments on the premises land them-
selves in the pit they are scorching along the
read to, one of the ways open to them for
getting out will be to dump the old-age
pension. It is an idea so rotten that the
Argus ought to second the motion, and it
only wants to be harped on long enough to
encourage the politicians now in charge to
even greater profligacy. Fat grudges the old-
age pension, and always has done so. Give
him reason to believe that this can be
diverted to the sustenance of Capital if lie
only keeps on pawning and spending hard
enough, then he at once notices how t\Vo
birds can be assassinated with one stone.
Why, in the event of embarrassment at the
pay-out window, should it be considered that
old-age pensions had been the last straw?
Why should the unfortunate old pensioner
be hit to leg in order that interest-mongers
and Cocked Hats and politicians may get in
out of the wet ? Why should the obligation
to Capital have the force of a religious belief
and the moral debt due to the aged and infirm
be shed like ruined pants? Payment of old-
age pensions may be mere empiricism—a
poor substitute for real economic reforms. 1
think it is. At best the pension is no better
than *a ransom paid by the well-to-do to the
indigent. But it means a lot to the pen-
sioner, and its continuance is a debt owed by
the community just as definitely as if these
old people held it in sealed bonds. The Atm
can make up its mind that before that debt is
repudiated by the Australian people there
will be quite a busy day spent tidying lip.
“Fleurbftix” sees it through :
A par ill B. 1/8/TB, relating- to the “aid” given
to inventors and inventions of promise recalls my
ease. My partner, a marine engineer, and myself,
a civil engineer of sorts, evolved a new thing in

Board of S. Aus., and it was forwarded on to Mel-
bourne. Got provisional patent and waited until
we were tired. Went over to see about it. Found
that another man had also sent in something' similar,
but it was mechanically impossible. Our affair
was shelved. Appealed to Minister, who ordered a
review. I asked for outside expert opinion on the
invention and got it. Result, favorable. Mote

passage. Accepted it. Then our motor unaccount-
ably falls to pieces although brand new, and we
missed the transport. More wait. But the case to.

last we g-ot away, g-oing via America. In New York
our luggage unaccountably went astray. We man-
aged to get the ship just in time; On board her several
of our letters were stolen. Arrived in England to
find that two days before we left Aussie another Chap
had collected a big sum for same principle as ours,
although his idea was not so simple. My partner
was given a commission in R.N.R. and I, previously
holding a commission in A.I.F, but knocked out iii
France, was given a position in a famous laboratory.
Wound troubling- me again, I was- given a munition-
worker’s passage back to Australia with injunctions
to hold my tongue, lienee the dash.
Killed last week on his fourth day at the
Western Front. Captain Richard Seddon, of
M.L., eldest son of “King” Dick. In all
respects young Dick was the antithesis of
his tumultuous dad. When the Boer war
broke out and sent the old man clean off Ids
head, son Richard, then decorating a stool in
a warehouse, was handed it commission and
went to the veldt. lie came back with several
medals and the recollection of having been
an A.D.C. to Roberts. Rater on, he became
the plaintiff in a libel action against the
now-dead Tommy Taylor, at that time a
vehement political opponent of Premier
Seddon and a prominent lime juicer. Taylor
having allegedly impugned his qualities as
a soldier. Young Seddon won the case, but
the proceedings were very injudicious, He
remained in the Defence Department, and sub-
sequently proceeded to England for training
at Camberley Staff College. Returning to
M.L., he found the old man’s opponents in
charge, and when they grudgingly offered
him a minor job in the Backblocks he told
them to go to blazes or somewhere, and sub-
sided into an ordinary suit of clothes. For
a long time his offer of service in the exist-
ing rumpus was rejected on the ground of
having thrown clods at discipline, but early
in the year the dead past was given decent
interment. Old Dick was a massive, mas-
terful person with a roar. Young Dick was
spare of build, pale and soft-voiced. lie was
about 40. His two brothers, Tom and Stuart,
have been at the Front this long time.

THE INVISIBLE FOE.
Now, Miss Polini’s daddy dear a pair of nephews had:
Young Hugh (the one she loved) was good, the other
bloke was bad.
The bad one wore an evil smile when telling wicked
lies;
To indicate lias nature vile lie rolled his pencilled
eyes.
Besides, his name was Stephen, which, since drama
first began,
Has mostly stood for proof of sin and wickedness in
man—
The world’s respect all Hughs may win; a Stephen
rarely can.
Ten thousand pounds of petty cash the godless
nephew “shook,”
And very blaCk ’gainst brother Hugh the evidence
did look.
From uncle’s mansion in disgrace the good young
nephew slunk,
AVhilst Miss Polini hid her face and truly sad was
mine.
On Hugh, he knew, his daughter’s hopes of happiness
were built;
So, when he spotted Stephen’s crime and proved it
to the hilt,
He made the villain write a full confession of his
guilt.
Between two pages of a book the paper he concealed
(The book it was a copy new of “David Copperfield”),
And then, a sadly stricken man, he tottered round the
room—
The crime that Stephen had confess’d spelt ailing
uncle’s doom—-
And, ere of Hugh’s sweet innocence his girl he could
acquaint,
He staggered off in deep distress, like one about to
faint,
And, oh, in the adjoining room he (lied of heart
complaint.
Well, there you are! Dear daddy dead ; the heroine
in grief;
The villain letting folks suppose his brother was the
thief,
Yet very anxious all the time, obsessed by dark
intent
To search the corpse’s sitting-room and pinch that
document.
He did not dread the buried dead, he only feared
the quick:
Yet something, something in that room turned
Stephen’s tummy sick;
It was, as Miss Polini knew, the Spook of uncle
Dick.
Invisible to mortal eye, in vain the worried Spook
Directed poor Miss P. to try to find the Dickens
book.
She felt the Presence striving hard to tell her
what to do;
She felt It wanted her to prove the innocence of
Hugh.
But neither Hugh nor she could read the Spirit’s
hints aright,
AVhilst, as for Steve, he stared aghast, half-paralysed
with fright,
And dared not search dead uncle’s room, except in
broad daylight.
At last —at last the long lost truth was quietly
revealed.
The Presence made the girl repeat some lines of
Copperfield:
A doctor took the volume down, and, prompted by
the Spook,
The cat leapt lightly from the bag, or, rather from
the book.
The wicked nephew cried “My Gawd!” and vanished
from the show,
And Miss Polini thanked the Spook in accents sweet
and low—
To her a friend invisible, to villainy a foe.

If “The Invisible Foe,’’ staged at the
King’s (Melb.) last Saturday, is an English
play it serves as an indirect apology for some
of the American plays lately introduced to
us. They, at least, moved rapidly in all
eases and were bright, as a rule. The Taits’
new drama is slow of movement, dull in
spirit, clumsy in construction, conventional
in characterisation and crudest in its comic
relief. And it has the audacity to demand
an almost impossibly-strong performance of
the unfortunate villain, who stands convicted
at the outset of reckless fraud, and is
subsequently required to show all the terror
of Richard the Third without the assistance
of a A’isible or audible spectre. Cyril
Maekay’s undisguised methods of melodrama
missed the ’bus in this trying situation. His
lurid sneers, obtrusive dissimulations, theat-
rical gestures and general loudness of style
intensified the crudity of the author’s con-
ception and produced titters instead of
thrills. Miss. Wilton rather over-emphasised
lier comic-relief points in the festive charac-
ter of a husband-hunting widow, and the rest
of the acting, with the exception of Maurice
Dudley’s safe and stodgy confidential clerk,
was a' trifle on the underdone side. The end
of Act 1 provided one convincing moment in
the performance. Harmon Lee, as a stereo-
typed elderlv uncle suffering from awful
pains at the heart, staggered artistically into
the next room, and the sound of a falling
body and a rush of alarmed persons to the
catastrophe was adroitly stage-managed.
After which Miss Polini received a gentle
intimation from l)r. Kay Souper that her
daddy was no more. Whereupon she said :
“He will want me near him,” as she rose to
go. Just then the supposititious corpse in the
imaginary next room seemed a cold, solemn
fact. The beautiful voice of Miss Polini
and her naturalness in sitting down to think,
or standing up to say something, made her
interesting in her spook-haunted part. But
she didn’t tend to accelerate the pace of a
slow-going piece.
* * * *
“The Thirteenth Chair,” at the Royal
(Melh.) seems to be giving large audiences all
the mystery they expected. The stage is merged
into the auditorium what time darkness
reigns throughout the house, and something of
an impression of having joined the stance
circle remains with the public to the end.
They feel like paying-guests of Gaston Mer-
vale, the convincing host, and would be
hardly surprised to hear that lan Maclaren
got his death stab from an irate fiddler, who
had objected to Mac’s undue assertion of
himself, and crept up from the orchestra to
reduce him to silence. Also they would like
to have another dark seance, with the arro-
gant detective in the 13th chair, so as to give
the murderer one more chance to commit a
capital offence.
“Katinka,” the melodious opera at Her
Majesty’s (Melb.), will be entitled to call
itself The 13th Week on Saturday. The
31st instant will he Katinka’s last Saturday
night. “Oh, Oh, Delphine!” is billed for a
week later.
At the Tivoli (Melh.) the news of a
change of revue next Saturday is thankfully
received. There was no fault to find with
“Time, Please,” in its earlier days and nights,
hut in old age it, grew monotonous. Age
seemed to stale the infinite variety of the
show, or perhaps its variety was insuffici-
ently infinite. “Honi Soit” comes to the
rescue this Saturday, and a new principal,
John Junior, will help Barry Lupino to
make things go the pace.
The Bijou (Melb.) has staged a new first
part called “The Cave of Shells.” Chas.
Pope and three black-faced solemnities hold
down the end seats in this unpretentious
seance. The second part is stronger for
the appearance of Daisy Harcourt, who has
put a hard Yankee finish on an unimpressive
voice. Fred Bluett is also present, and his
riotous fun is a welcome antidote to the
tedious Sa-Hera, who is still posing as an
occult fount into which the credulous can
dip for information.

One of Melba’s prize canaries, Peggy
Center, was the principal Chappell trophy at
the Auditorium (Melh.) last Saturday night.
Peggy’s programme was decorated with the
confectionery of Guy d’Hardelot, Liza Leh-
mann, Fourdrain, and Massenet, and although
she sweetly sang each little item it was in
a manner remote from enthusiasm. Her star
number was the inexpressibly dainty “Papil-
lon” of Fourdrain. Baritone A. C. Bartle-
man warbled two selections of “Un Ballo in
Maschera” as if he were in the confidence of
the composer, whilst he voiced some songs
from “The Shropshire Lad” in an equally
confident fashion. Tenor Percy Blundell
was not so tasteful an entertainer as a com-
manding personage named Foster, who was

Doubleday gives
the first of her
violin recitals at the Auditorium (Melb.)
on Saturday (31st), and the second on the
following Thursday. In any city of the
world the young lady is an artist of distinc-
tion. In her native Melbourne, making her
first appearance since she was a child, she
should get a great welcome.
Mary Pickford is suffering spanks and
promiscuous charity, whilst unknowingly
heiress to a diamond-mine, in “The
Little Princess,” at Hoyt’s (Melb.) this
week. The film is based on a yarn by
Frances Hodgson Burnett, but Mary man-
ages to translate Frances’s artless' humor
into some spirited fooling. “Plis Mother’s
Boy,” which keeps close to “The Little
Princess,” demonsrr- tes the electrical effect
of a village 1 : on a shy, inoffensive
character. CliarLs Lay gets up the requisite
dynamic energy in the story and puts the
opposition to sb-j >vith an opiate left. At
Hoyt’s Lyceum .Vi a y Pickford travels ahead
of Miriam Coopei in a plot called “Be-
trayed,” which looks like one of O. Henry’s
offspring brutally maltreated by a cruel
stepfather.
The Britannia (Melb.) is the current
refuge of “The Beast of Berlin,” and the
management has looted the dictionary of
opprobrium to describe the monster. The
film professes to reveal every “infamous
secret” of the tyrant’s court, and certainly
suggests that it must have been an asbestos
camera that gathered the information. At
the Melba, last Monday, there was a more
attractive menu with Charlie Chaplin in
“The Cure,” and Kitty Gordon in “The
Purple Lily.” To-day (Thursday) Earle
M illiams and Grace Harmond get into close
touch in a new Vitagraph,offering, “The Seal
of Silence.”
Abdy’s boxing kangaroo is a pleasant cir-
cumstance at the Tivoli (Adelaide). A sport-
ing audience admires to see-him act according
to Queensberry rules, and when ho gets
excited and forgets them he is admired more
than ever. Baron, a good ventriloquist, adds
to the strength of the show, and Leonard
Nelson is as popular as ever. As for Le
Blanc and Mack, they are the same old pair
of improbable Hebrews who are steadily
taken down for their good cash as no sons
of Abraham in real life ever were. The

so well at the
Royal that it has
been transferred to
the Grand for a
further run. The
Royal itself has a
circus picture with
a lot of joyous
wild animals. Billie
Burke at the Pav.,
and Julian Eltinge
at Wondergraph,
are both charming
in their different
styles. In “Pan-
tliea,” at West’s,
the gloomy and
familiar old ques-
tion whether a
wife may properly
sell herself with the
idea of saving her
husband’s life has been discussed more
thoroughly than is necessary.
“S’niee,” the revue which began at the
Tivoli (Sydney) on Saturday, promises to
be a success, though it would be a better
show if the management had a good chief
comedian about the house. Eve Kelland, the
new Australian leading-lady, is large and
fair, with a light contralto voice and a quiet
method. She is an experienced comedienne,
has personality, and took charge straight
away. Featherweight Fayette Perry, who is
like a nice little girl grown larger but not
grown up, provided a dainty contrast. She
scored heavily in a poster-kid song with
four clever Tivoli children. Espinosa (pro-
ducer), FI. de Robeck, Chris Wren and
Charles Albert attended by turns to the
comedy; but that department never whizzed
except in the mock bull-fight, where the rag-
ing panto, beast was knocked out by having
a bunch of onions thrust under its nose.
Leslie Gaze came back singing to the stage,
wearing a bright blue naval uniform and a
continuous smile that never flickered. Odds
are he still smiles like-that in his sleep.
Dancer Elsie Parkcs had a lot to do, and
the work of the girls who pirouette with her
seemed to indicate that Espinosa has been
teaching, busily. Still, Elsie has nothing
as distinctive as Ballets A and B of the
“Samples” show. Peggy Peate sang well,
but was a trifle heavy in her comedy work ;
and Harry Burns, a brisk stepper-, wasted
some time in a tiresome patter turn with
Eve Kelland as partner. The Clints and
Harry Whaite provided some notable cloths.
There was a dashing Alpine scene, but the
best effect was got with an elaborate pink
and grey color-scheme, in which the girls
even wore grey wigs to harmonise with their
surroundings. Will- Quintrell. .as usual,
attended to the music, and one excur-
sion on to the stage to play a piano accom-
paniment for Eve Kelland. It was very
tastefully done.
"BUSINESS BEFORE PLEASURE.” AT
SYDNEY CRITERION.
Abe (Jus. Waters) tries to explain to his
Rosie (Maggie Moore).
“Oh, Boy!” finishes its long run at Her
Majesty’s (Sydney) on Friday. Starting
on Saturday, “So Long, Letty,” will be
revived for a few nights.
“Business Before Pleasure” still goes
strong at the Criterion (Sydney). Profits
are good.
“Pierrot Pie” was partly re-made by Syd-
ney James during the week, and everybody
who had a slice of the original turn-out will
probably line up at the Playhouse (Sydney)
for a second helping. The double bur-
lesque. “The Masquerader in the Thirteenth
Chair,’” is still in the dish.
Guy Bates Post having held to his suc-
cessful season at the Palace (Sydney) till
Tuesday, “Gran’dad Rudd” had to make a
mid-week start on Wednesday night. The
Sundry Showman will have something to
say about the old pot next week.
“The Lure of the Bush,” the £5O prize
Australian picture, was screened privately
at the Australian Film House (Sydney) on
Monday afternoon. It deals graphically with
station life, and the photography is a credit.
The story follows the progress of an English
jaekeroo through the different: phases of his
education in the Sunny South. There is
shearing, droving and a real kangaroo hunt.
There are kookaburras and ’possums and a
woolshed dance. The hero (“Snowy” Baker)
and the heroine (Beta Tress) do some stir-
ring acts on horseback. Mr. Percy Reay,
a well-known Sydney pressman, is the
author of “The Lure of the Bush,” Franklyn
Barrett arranged the scenario, and Claud
Flemming was the “producer.” It is under-
stood that the film will be shown through
U.S.A.

At the Strand (Sydney) Mae Marsh is
battling with the flotsam and jetsam of
New York while her lover is fighting for
civilisation on the battlefield. “In Fields
of Honor” is the title of the film. The Crys-
tal Palace has some wonderful scenery of the
Canadian backwoods, amidst which Kitty
Gordon flourishes as “The Purple Lily.”
Mary Pickford shakes her world-screened
ringlets from the sheets of Hoyt’s and the
Haymarket. “The Little Princess” is this
week's helping of Mary. Tb Lyceum has a
varied programme. “Who-. False Tongues
Speak” provides myste l . and sensation,
while Elsie Ferguson is the heroine in
Agnes and Egert.ai Castle’s charming
romance, “The Bose of the World.”
“Dry Gin” : When the ship Scammell went
smash on the Victorian coast down towards
the Otway, years ago, with a cargo of assorted
liquors and notions, one of the coastal
settlers buried his share of the firewater in
a paddock and sowed grain over it. He had
a. fine crop just coming on when someone
gave the show away, and the Customs officers
came down and dug up the goods. In the
days when shipwrecks were commoner on
that coast luxuries were cheap in the Otway
country. After the Eric the Red went to
pieces in the ’eighties there was free tobacco
for years along the coast nearly as far as
Warrnambool.

The Commercial of Australia during the
half-year bought out the little National of
Tasmania, which had its headquarters at
Launceston and had 15 branches, most of
them in the Speck’s north and west. This
purchase, the chairman told shareholders the
other day, “had given the bank a sound
and established business in fertile and pros-
perous parts of Tasmania, where they
desired to be represented.” The National’s
net profits for the past five years have
averaged about £9lOO each half-year, but its
assets were only taken over by the Commer-
cial on March 1 last.
The C. B. of A. had a particularly bad
time in the smash of the early ’nineties, and
the balance-sheet still carries the scar in
this way; Capital—llll,73s prefs. paid to
£lO. £2,117,350; 191,318 ordinaries paid to
10s., £95,659; total, £2,213,009. Then fol-
lows the line, “Deduct estimated deficiency
in connection with the Special Assets Trust
Co., Ltd., £612,660” —giving a net actual
capital of £1,600,349. In the clean-up the
bank could not write off fill its losses —there
was not enough capital to write off to cor-
respond. However, the depositors finally
accepted cum. pref. shares 3 p.c., to be
increased to 4 p.c. when things looked up.
This latter rate has been paid since June,
1914. The worst of the wreckage was
handed over to a separate co., the Special
Assets Trust Co., which finished its job about
a year ago. Any losses incurred by
realising on the old properties under book
value was made good from the bank’s profits,
and except for an almost regular £5OOO
written off premises, most of the amounts
shown as written off in the introductory
table have been utilised for this purpose.
Combining the operations of the Bank and
the Trust gives this table:—

From the profits of the last half-year £25,000
has been appropriated for “reinstatement of
capital,” and the report states that the
“realisation of further assets of the old bank
has increased the net actual capital to the
extent of £5000.” Six months ago £lO.OOO
was recovered in the same way.
The National of Tasmania balance-sheet
figures as at November 30 last were as fol-
lows :
Free deposits ..£389,994 Liquid assets . . £269,907
Fixed deposits.. 332,176 Advances, etc.. 736,970
Other liabilities 17,215 Premises, etc.. . 23,940
There were 39,050 shares paid to £5, and the
C. B. of A. offered £6 15s. per share, and
seemingly that was the price paid. But
apart from the purchase of the National and
the tacking on of its balance-sheet figures,
there have been some considerable move-
meats. Here is a comparison going back to
the last term before the war: —

Premises .. . . 420,635 447,940 473,840
The National added less than three-quarters
of a million of advances; most of the
remaining increases are explained by
advances made to customers to take up War
Loan and the financing of the Government
wheat scheme. Like all other banks the
C. B. of A. is proceeding very cautiously.
The chairman assured shareholders that
directors were “looking carefully into future
possibilities and making provision to meet
any depression which might be experienced
later on.” However, the financing of the
wheat and the War Loan have had a big
effect on the proportion of liquid assets com-
pared with liabilities. At June 30, 36 p.c.
of the total liabilities was held liquid, com-
pared with the large proportion of 48 p.c.
six months ago, and almost 49 p.c. a couple
of months before the war. However, the
position is apparently very sound, and, as
will be seen by the growth of deposits, the
bank has made good progress during the past
four years.
* * * *
The scheme for the amalgamation of the
National Bank of Australasia and the
Colonial Bank has been definitely and unani-
mously decided upon by the two manage-
ments, and, the Court having approved,
shareholders will shortly be called to-
gether to discuss the proposal. The present
authorised capital of the two banks is:
National, £3,407.904 ; Colonial, £737.931 10s.;
total, £4,145,835 10s. Paid capital is made
up in this way:—
National.
30,578 fully paid £lO prefs. £305,780
238,488 £8 ords. paid to £5 1,192,440
— £1,498,220

to £1 15s 135,236 10/-
'439,280 10/-
Combined paid-up capital . . . . £1,937,500 10/-
The pref. capital in both banks is prefer-
ential as to dividends only, and this only
up to 5 p.c. It is proposed to merge the
two banks into one, retaining the name
of The National Bank of Australasia.
Ltd., with a paid up capital of
£2,000,000. Colonial shareholders are to be
given shares in the National in exchange
for their present holdings; the prefs. receiv-
ing one fully-paid £lO share for each £9 15s.
Colonial share, and the holder of every 20
Colonial ords. (paid to £1 155.) will receive
seven new National shares (£S each and paid
up to £5). This relieves the holder of present
Colonial ordinaries of an uncalled liability
to the extent of £1 9s. per share- Tim
National pref. holders are to get a cash
bonus of £1 per share to adjust existing
relative interests and partly in considera-
tion of the proposal that after the amalga-
mated bank has paid six half-yearly divi-
dends at the rate of 8 p.c. p.a. all' prefs.
shall then surrender their preference rights.
After these transfers, the capital of the new
National Bank will be: —
61,762 prefs. fully paid to £lO ~ £617,620
265,536 ords. of £8 paid to £5 .. 1,327,680
£1,945,300
The new bank will then issue a further 238
£lO pref. shares, and offer present holders
10,464 new ordinaries at par. This will
give the total paid-up capital of £2.000.000,
while the nominal capital will be £5.000,000
(88,000 £lO prefs. unissued and 161,500 un-
issued ords. of £8 each). As at March 31
last, the National had reserves and undivided
profit amounting to £718,302, and the
Colonial £309,461; and it is now announced
that the amalgamated bank will start with
reserves of £1,000,000, apart from any sur-
plus profits made during the current term.
Thus, as The Bulletin expected, after both
managements had looked over each other’s
assets, there has been no writing down. The
National has 165 branches and 50 agencies,
about half in Victoria; and the Colonial 70
branches and 30 agencies, all in Victoria,
except for the London and Sydney branches.
Both banks are at present operating in
almost a score of Victorian towns, so besides
the added strength secured by the amalgama-
tion, considerable economy should be effected.
The principal balance-sheet figures of both
banks and their totals as at March last were
as follows:
National. Colonial. Combined.

Incidentally it has been arranged to include
Colonial chairman Bowes Kelly and F. G
Clarke on the new National Board, the
remaining three Colonial directors being
handed £2OOO each as a sort of solatium for
the loss of their jobs.

1916 war-time profits tax £3535 ) 12,480
During the past year the co. was called upon
to pay £3535 war-time profits tax on the
1916 profits. The directors did not antici-
pate having to pay anything approach-
ing that figure, and consequently the
profits for the past year have been
Severely cut into, and the directors
have had to go to the bank to help them
out. Going back to the 1916 figures, and
deducting this £3535 tax. it will be found
that the net profits for that year were £4949,
and that the 20 p.c. distribution to share-
holders (£6410) was not earned by a long
way. If the directors had known at the
time the intentions of the Government in
the matter of the war-time profits tax they
could not have considered for a moment so
large a distribution to shareholders. As it~
is, the politicians have humbugged cos., until
they don’t know where they stand in the
matter of taxation. As the table shows,
this woollen co. has had a hard struggle. In
1907 half the capital was written off as lost,
and since then, and including the recent good
years, the dividends have averaged only 44
p.c. p.a. on the written-down capital. How-
ever, war contracts and the extra business
that has come in as a result of the Protec-
tion afforded the industry by Wilhelm’s tin-
fish have given the co., a big lift. The sales
figures have moved this way:—
1908 ..£26,024 1915 ..£46,110

Here is a comparison of tlic balance-sheet
figures:—■

Since the war began £]4,l(>l of new capital
has been got in, and liabilities have been
reduced by £4SSS. Meantime £B3OB has been
added to land, buildings and plant and £2091
to the more or less liquid assets. So, after
paying dividends averaging about 11 p.c. p.a.
the co. is only a little over £lOOO better off
than it was when the rush of orders started
to come in four ago. The position may
not be actually as good as that, for the war-
time profits tax may take a cut out of last
year’s profits, and, further, everything
depends on the valuation of the plant, some
oi which has been bought at war prices, and
the amount of depreciation allowed. Alto-
gether, the history of this co.’s efforts to
establish the woollen manufacturing indus-
try at Ipswich does not make cheerful read-
ing. Certainly it is doing better now than
it has ever done; but there’s no guarantee
as to the future. With the present hope-
lessly inadequate tariff, the importer of goods
from cheap-labor countries must come into
his own again after the war if the politicians
don’t do their duty to the Commonwealth’s
industries.

The new chairman. Sir Charles Mackejlar
(he succeeded the late Adam Forsyth), ex-
plains the leap in profits this way:—
The increased profit is actually due more to extra
business than to larger gross profits. Compared with
our turnover 10 years ago, the sales have more than
doubled, while the percentage of gross profit has
increased slightly over 2 p.c., the prices in this
market being consistently lower than in England
and America at corresponding periods. This higher
percentage cannot be considered as in anv way an
excessive advance in profit in view of ' the ‘ verv
considerable risks that we were obliged to take in
making heavy purchases at the present inflated prices,
and it only gives a moderate return for the extra
labor and capital employed and the risk of loss.
The co. during recent years has gone in
extensively for manufacturing instead of
depending upon overseas products, and its
up-to-date factory at Chippendale is turning
out a wide variety of goods. During the
year £25,000 of new capital lias been got in,
and the old debenture debt for a similar
amount has been extinguished. Here is a
comparison of the balance-sheet figures over
a period of live years:—
, 1913.. 1917. 1918.
Ca P ltal £75,000 £75,000 £lOO,OOO
Debentures .. .. 25,000 25,000

Book debts .. .. 47,691 59,659 57,526
Cash investments, etc. .. 3,135 11,149 10,502
Stocks are substantial, and no doubt most, of
it lias been purchased at abnormally high
prices. In the balance-sheet they are in-
cluded “at cost or under,” and, particularly
in view of the good time the co. has been
having, and also not forgetting the Board’s
conservative policy in the past, reasonable
allowance has doubtless been made to meet
any possible slump in prices. Plant, etc'., is
apparently also well written down, for
though many additions have been made dur-
ing the past few years, freehold, plant and
fixtures are now given a book value of
£2224 less than five years ago. After paying
a regular 10 p.c., the co. has improved its
position by at least £ll,OOO during the past
five years.

The figures for the December half of last
year were affected by Hie big strike; and
though an increased tonnage was raised dur-
ing the past six months compared with the
June term of last year, which showed record
profits, the profits for the recent half are less
than those shown for the December term.
Here is a comparison of some of the figures:

priated for income tax and royalties; total.
£62,266. Adding to the profit on working
account the interest and dividends earned
during the half-year (£10,344) and the un-
claimed dividends (£958) tacked on to equal-
isation reserve give a total of £227,557.
Thus the profit of £165,291 shown in the
table.
During the half-year 128,400 tons ore wore
treated by the mill, giving these products: : —

The metal contents of the concentrates was
14,366 tons lead, 531,7660 z. silver and 1603
tons zinc; and the recoveries were 74.6 p ; c.
lead, 52.4 p.c. silver and 8.6 p.c. zinc. Tin-
whole of the zinc tailings are handed ovbr
to the Amalgamated Zinc (De Bavay’s), who
divide profits with the South. The quartz
tailings, in which comparatively little metal
remains, are sent underground again for
filling. The whole of the 19,136 tons slimes
were handled by the lead section of tin-
selective flotation slime plant, which pro-
duced 2773 tons concentrates containing no
less than 78.4 p.c. of the lead contents, 84,2
p.c. of the silver and retained only 8.2 p.c.
of the zinc. Six months ago manager Wain-
wright explained that experiments with tin-
completed zinc section of this plant had
proved that an excellent grade zinc concen-
trate could be obtained from the de-leaded
slime residues at a reasonable cost and with
good metal recoveries. But as there is a
very limited market for slime-zinc concen-
trates it was decided to utilise the plant for
treating the old slime dump and obtaining
a lead concentrate for which there is a
ready market. A start was made early this
year, the slime being broken from the dump
b.V hydraulic jets and pumped to the plant,

The approach of summer makes it imperative for
every stock-owner to give a thought to the purifica-
tion of drinking water for his stock. If he is content
to let them drink muddy, slimy water he cannot
expect them to keep in good condition. All over.the
State careful stock-owners are using Aluminoferric in
the proportion of one pound to every 2000 gallons of
water. It ensured pure, liquid water in dams, wells,
tanks, etc., at very low cost, by precipitating all
impurities and leaving the water clear and pure,
free from any ingredient injurious to man or beast.

For the seven-year period dividends work
out at about 15s. sd. for every ton of ore
mined. No statement of ore reserves is
given this half-year, but six months ago it
was announced that development had kept
pace with ore extraction and that reserves
were 3,500,000 tons. The average rate of
extraction since June, 1911, has been 285,000
tons a year.

The June, 1918; accounts will probably be
the last presented by the South as a no-
liability co. The reconstruction scheme out-
lined on this page a few weeks ago will be
placed before shareholders on Aug. 30, and
it confirmed the co. will make a fresh start
as from July 1 last as the Broken Hill
South Ltd. Present paid capital of £163,727
is comprised of 130,90 S fully-paid £1 shares
and 69,092 contribs. paid to 9s. Gd. To
bring both shares into line it is proposed to
hand the holders of fully-paid £1 shares
10s. 6d. per share from the assets of the
present co. (=£68,727). That will reduce
the present capital to 200,000 shares each
paid to 9s. 6d., or a total of £95,000. For
each of these shares four fully-paid £1
shares will be allotted in the new co.. which
will have a capital of £BOO,OOO (800,000
shares of £1 each). The difference between
the new capital and the old (after the
repayment of 10s. 6d. to the fully-paids) is
thus £705,000. The reserves as at June
30 last were £781,470. made up in this way:
reserve fund. £395,000; equalisation reserve,
£73,955; undivided profit, £312,515.

The directors of the South Brisbane Gas,
the co. whose affairs were recently the sub-
ject of a scathing report to Parliament by
the Government Chief Audit Inspector, in a
letter to the Brisbane press state:—
We not only deny but assure the public that we are
in a position to refute every accusation made or
inferred against us in the report. Everything we
have done has been dorre properly and in the best
interests of the company.
They further say :
As these accusations have been made against us
publicly, and as we have no means of obtaining
redress by an action for defamation, we are forced to
make our defence before the public. As soon as
we read the report in the press we intended doing
this, but without the documents referred to in the
report we could not do so. Those documents were
not laid before Parliament with the report; they
have not yet been laid before Parliament, and so
far we have not been able to see them. Until we
do so we are unable to make our full defence.
Well, The Bulletin sincerely hopes, not
only for the directors’ sakes, but also for the
shareholders’, that they can satisfactorily
answer the charges made. What interests
shareholders and this paper more than any-
thing else is: what is the present actual
value of the co.’s buildings, plant, etc., and
how does it compare with the balance-sheet
figures? First of all, the Gas Referee fixed
the amount invested in the undertaking at
£160.051, and the co.’s balance-sheet showed
assets worth £318,588. The Government
Chief Audit Inspector, on the writing up
of assets by £lOO,OOO in 1914, reported that
“the assets were not in the business to war-
rant the issue” of the £lOO,OOO bonus deben-
ture stock. The directors say they are “in
a position to refute every accusation.” Well,
for a start, what about settling this valua-
tion question without delay and definitely
proving to the shareholders’ satisfaction that
the assets are worth every penny shown in
the balance-sheet?
While;the unwatering scheme on the Hill
End field (N.S.W.) is proceeding the Mar-
shall brothers, following the advice of Gov-
ernment-Geologist Harper, are bagging 3oz.
stone in a series of crosscuts. The full
strength of Harper’s interim report on the
field shows that the expert agrees with the
widely-held view that something worth while
could always be expected at the junction of
two geologically distinct formations that
wander all over the leases. That is why the
Reward mine has hung such a lot of faith
on the intersection of the present drives go-
ing north and the big Robert Emmett cross-
course, lying at right angles. But the big-
body of water on the other side of the cross-
course has been too menacing. Hence the
scheme fdr getting at the natural dam from
a much lower level. Meanwhile the gold
taken from the meeting of the minor reefs
is more than paying expenses. Amalgamated
Hill End, which retains the working of the
mica vein, is putting through 40 tons of
stone, expected to average 3oz. The Reward’s
last fortnight run returned 46 ounces.
The old Brown’s Creek mine, which lias
had as varied a history during the past 40
years as any other gold proposition in N. S.
Wales, is again the subject of litigation.
After the mine had absorbed tens of thou-
sands of hard cash in efforts to beat the
water, business was suspended some years
ago so far as actual returns were concerned.
Recently the leases were cancelled on the
ground of failure to maintain labor con-
ditions. On the date of cancellation —July
39 —and within one minute of the hour 6f
gazettal, James Bulloch, of Blayney, with
three others, armed with four watches and
any quantity of trenching apparatus, pro-
ceeded to mark out the boundary of 10 acres.
But A. A. Lycett, of Balmain, has asked War-
den Burke to declare Bulloch’s application
void on several technical grounds, including
inaccuracy in pegging out. A heap of evi-
dence has been taken in the case, but decision
has been withheld pending the visit of the
Warden to the field.
New Baker’s Greek, Hillgrovc (N.S.W.),
is collecting its second shilling call. Engine
troubles have caused some delay in starting
the battery, which is to be fed with 200 tons
stone per month for a start. When treating
400 tons per month the manager figures a
profit of £BOO, if the yield averages SOdwt.
per ton. Development included 500 ft. of
driving and winzing last half-year. In driv-
ing No. IS level to the south a crosscourse
has been met with, but though most of the
rich patches are near crosscourses there is
no invariable rule. No doubt there is rich
stone left in the mine, 'for the old co.
crushed 826 tons for 32070 z. in six months
before banding over the property.

Bendigo Amalgamated admits to a loss
of £58,841 from May 24, 1917, to July 2,
1918. This was because 132,351 tons sent
to the battery cost 325. 3d. per ton, includ-
ing capital expenditure, against an average
grade won of 225. per ton. If the tributors’
14,418 tons (which gave 69420 z.) be
reckoned in, then the battery crushed
346,769 tons for gold worth £161,906.
Moline’s costs sheet shows that money went
this way:—
Cost per ton.

Mill and transport .. . . 4.48

Fault does not lie with these costs, though
they seem big. Maintenance and surface
supervision were high because with a swag
of shafts going, outgo was staggering. That
44 miles of prospecting and driving work
was done shows how the co. chipped along to
get on to gold. That pluck isn’t dead in.
Bendigo is proved by the 50 faces Dyason
is keeping going and his promise that if his
luck changes he will be working additional
ends so as to test fresh areas. His failures
are the Cornish, Unity, Hercules and Vir-
ginia ore bodies. Had that not happened the
battery would have handled 8500 tons fort-
nightly, instead of having to be kept down to
5100 tons. However, despite the big dis-
appointment, a feature of Dyason’s and
Moline’s talk to shareholders is their pluck to
recognise that the only way to battle
through is to keep going. One thing that
helps is the drop in costs, due to better
organisation and co-ordination during the
second half of the term, the result being that
the loss fell to £20,382 against £38,459 for
the first half of the year.
Though George Dickenson’s Al, Gaffney’s
Creek (Vic.), is a small doer, it yields good
profits. The past six months’ battery tally
was 6610 tons for £20,849 of gold, allowing
ss. per share to be paid in divs. As John
Till opened up a fair lot of ore from No. 9
to No. 12 levels, his reserves were saved
from shrinkage. Now he is being helped
further by the way in which the floor cut
in the rise above No. 12 level is opening out.
Costs have been stiff, roughly 365. tid. per
ton, but mining in the mountains always is
expensive. However, Till was lucky to be
able to keep his grade of ore at 655. for the
half-year.

Blythe River Iron Mines, Ltd. (Tas.),
is under option to the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment for £llO,OOO. Nominal capital is
£J ,000.000, and 500,000 £1 shares have been
issued and fully paid up. This capital is
represented by mining properties and rail-
way concessions, £469,993 ; mine expenditure,
£13,994 ; profit and loss debit, £10,556; rail-
way and survey expenditure, £4804; cash
and odds and ends, £4ll. One crowd, in
which were Wm. Jamieson, of the B. 11.
Prop., the late Fred Keats and Alfred Tol-
hurst, and Whitsitt, of the Speck, nursed the
show for a couple of decades. The Welsh
iron engineer, Derby, had a look at the
deposit, and though he gave it a reputation
as good as the best Swedish iron ore, nothing
came of liis report because the 14 million
needed to get things going was not forth-
coming. Japanese and Germans spent odd
moments having a look at Blythe River in
pre-war days. The B. 11. Prop, too, was
credited with eyeing the deposits as a pros-
pective second string to the Iron Knob. The
option is being taken up as a result of the
negotiations of the recently-knighted John
Higgins, honorary metallurgical adviser to
the Government, who, Acting Prime Minis-
ter Watt says, was offered the property by
the co. in his private capacity nearly a year
ago. So if the deal comes off Higgins is
to get a £lO,OOO commission cut from the
£llO,OOO “on the understanding that the
sum is to be invested and the income applied
to the promotion of the study of iron and

A sensation was caused in mining circles
in Launceston (Tas.) lately when news got
abroad that a very rich gold show had been
discovered about 20 miles out, near Bless-
ing-ton, and close to E. Trethewie’s Whis-
loea estate. The ground is south of (the old
Burns Creek workings. I». 11. Whittle, a
well-known prospector, was the discoverer.
Assays from one portion of the lode went
4Soz. to the ton, but the average assays have
been between Goz. and Boz. A reef 12in.
wide has been opened up for five chains in
length. As high as 12oz. lias been assayed
from surface stone. The show is merely at
a prospecting stage at present, and further
developments are awaited with interest. Old
hands consider the lode to be a continuation
of the Golden Gate reef at Mathinna.

Mount Bischoff (Tas.) made a profit of
£27.401 last half-year, which compares with
£7084 for the first half of 1917. Working
costs have risen to Bs. per ton crudes, and
Bischoff’s reserves are now valued at
0.29 per cent. tin. One-quarter p.c. tin is
worth from 15s. to 20s. at present prices;
but with tin at £2OO the value would be
about 10s. Just at present Bischoff is on
a very good wicket, as proved by the distri-
bution of £16,500 last half-year and the
recent increase in the monthly dividend to
7s. 6d. If this dividend can be maintained
while the boom lasts shareholders who
bought at £l5 will get a return of 30 p.c.
p.a. on their capital.

W. Cawdry, the prospector who discov-
ered osmiridium in the serpentine rock at
Nineteen Mile. Creek a few years ago, has
made another discovery at Mt. Stewart
(Tas.), where there are many alluvial
miners working. The present find is claimed
to be very rich —one piece of serpentine
weighing 131 b. to 141 b. is reckoned to have
£5O to £6O worth of osmiridium in it.
There are said to be tons in sight, though, of
course, not much of it is as rich as the
samples brought in.
The North Mount Farrell co. has moved
its headquarters from Devonport to Mel-
bourne. The old Speck co., therefore, will
be wound up, and a Victorian co. created
with the same nominal capital of £50,000 in
80,000 shares of 12s. Gd. each. This trans-
fer is due to Melbourne having acquired a
big interest in the show.

Having failed to make good with its
present holdings, Gwalia Consolidated is
now considering the purchase of some
adjoining shows at Leonora (W.A.). All
have produced gold at; some time or other,
but at present have little in sight and noth-
ing out of the way to recommend them at
depth. Others besides the Gwalia Central
are seeking their fortunes at this centre, but
nothing lias come their way so far; and, to
make things worse, the Sons of Gwalia
seems to be steadily declining. John Forrest
was the first white man to sight this once
prosperous field. That was in 1869, and lie
named the big rugged hill which towers,
above it Mount Leonora. He must have seen
the reefs that outcrop everywhere, but his
mind was on other things and he was
not a geologist. At any rate he made
no mention of them in his reports. For the
next 27 years the locality remained un-
known. Then a crowd of prospectors came
along from Coolgardie and discovered the
Sons of Gwalia and other mines.

Copper stocks are piling up in the Com-
monwealth, and the cos. are finding it difficult
to realise on their products unless helped
by very favorable contracts. Abercrombie,
Burraga (N.S.W.), which has been sending
concentrates to Port Kernbla for treatment,
has had to reduce its output. Wallaroo and
Moonta (S.A.) is also carrying heavy stocks,
and more shipping space is urgently "required
to relieve the position. The chairman even
hinted a few days back that the output
of the old show might have to be reduced.

“ Please accept my heartfelt thanks for your Clements Tonic.
“It is rather soon to report regarding its good qualities. I
have only taken two bottles, yet I appear to have taken on a

Peter Waite, the veteran S.A. squatter,
believes in arranging his benefactions him-
self instead of leaving his executors to do it.
He has already given to Adelaide University
his house and park at the foot of the hills
close by, 230 acres in all, one half for a
public park and sports ground, the other half
for the study of scientific agriculture, xi
gift of that kind is not much use to a uni-
versity without funds for the working of it,
and Mr. Waite has now added to it Elder,
Smith and Co. shares worth about £60,000
to produce an endowment. As in the former
case, the gift does not take effect till his
death, but he has made a bargain with the
S.A. Government that, in consideration of
his public-spirited gifts, no death-duties shall
be charged when the time comes.
Professor Leslie Wilkinson, who lately
arrived from London to start Sydney Uni-
versity's new Architectural School, was
trained at the Royal Academy Schools and
peregrinated Europe as the Academy’s gold
medallist. He was Assistant Professor at
London University’s School of Architecture
for 10 years, and since the war began was
on the staff of the University Officers’ Train-
ing Corps. He was released from service
to take on the N. S. Wales job. He is 35
and an enthusiatic town-planner.
The Australian training-ship Tingira lately
got a recruit who, with ordinary luck, ought
to become an admiral at a record early age.
Young Forsythe enlisted with the A.I.F. in
Victoria when 13^ —he looked big enough to
be the requisite 18 —served for 18 months as
a machine-gunner in France, and was in-
valided home with shrapnel wounds in the
arm. That makes him fully 151!
Andrew McCormac, who died in Adelaide
last week at 92, was a popular portrait-
painter there last century. He
was an Irishman who started as
a Baptist minister, but preferred
art and literature. He wrote
a lot, in both prose and verse,
but will he remembered best by
his paintings of Speakers and
Mayors at Parliament House and
the Town Hall. The present
generation of public men was
hardly aware that he was still
living.
“Cobber”: Our repatriation
scheme is a bit more generous
than those fashionable last cen-
tury. In May 1834 Corporal
James Eller applied to Colonel
George Arthur, then Lieut.-Gov-
ernor on Van Diemen’s Land, for
a small grant of Crown land.
Eller’s honorable discharge
showed 21 years nine months and
seven days’ service, including 15
years O.A.S. He had fought his
way through all the disturbances
of his time. The battles of Sala-
manca, Valencia, Vittoria and
the taking of Burgos were among
his performances, and he was one
of the forlorn hope who scaled
the walls at the storming of San
Sebastian. He had another
rough-up at Bayonne, and butted
in at the final charge at Water-
loo. Subsequently he served
seven years in the West Indies
and was then detailed to \ T an Diemen’s
Land, where he cracked up. His applica-
tion for a bit of bush was refused, because
his Is. a day pension was considered to
be an adequate provision.
Wealthy Lionel Robinson, of the London
.Stock Exchange, is getting rid of a bit of
surplus cash by giving a clutch of scholar-
ships to Scotch College, where he learned
how to calculate profits before starting to
make them. Robinson began life as a clerk
with Clarke and Co., Melbourne, of which
the late (Alfred) Clarke was the king-pin.
Afterwards he became a jobber on the Mel-
bourne Exchange and later bought a seat
thereon, when seats were fairly cheap,
presently partnering with William Clark, of
Gorrie and Clark. The Westralian boom
shot the pair up into the higher financial
ether, and they have remained there ever
since, pillowed on rosy clouds of pi'osperity.
Brother Arthur Robinson is Vic. Solicitor-
General and Works Minister.
The name of C. A. Reinecke, auditor for
the Broken Hill Proprietary, will not be
seen again on the balance-sheets. With
a bulky body and a weak heart and the
strain of constant travelling to Port Pirie,
Iron Knob and "the Hill” in all weathers
he has not been "a good life” for some
years, and when a chill caught in Adelaide
turned to bronchial pneumonia he was
dead in 48 hours. Outside his work his
only hobby was music, and he owned some
really valuable old fiddles. He was born
in Adelaide 6S years ago, wenfc to St. Peter’s
College, aud had no interest in Germany
whatever. Indeed, he gave to the Allies’
cause his only son, George, of the Adelaide
Tramways Trust, who was killed in France
in 1916.
MAKING FOR HOME.
FRITZ ( dejectedly ): “How I wish I teas
back in der dear Faderland.”
HANS: “Cheer up, Frits! We’re getting
nearer to it every day."
“Camelero”: It’s just about time that
someone inquired into the heroism of No. 2135,
Pte* A. G. Morrison, of the Imperial Camel
Corps (Australian Section). On December 17,
1917, Morrison did not answer at roll-call
and was posted absent without leave. It
seems that, wearying of Southern Palestine,
he had decided on an unofficial trip to
Europe to have a cut at Fritz. He got away
with a draft of reinforcements; but soon after
leaving the Egyptian coast he was placed
under arrest for desertion. After spending
Christmas in an Italian port he was placed
on a transport for return to his unit. The
vessel carried many English nurses, and
Morrison was the only Australian on board.
Within sight of Alexandria a torpedo struck
the ship, and in a few minutes troops and
nurses were struggling in the water. It was-
then that Morrison made good. He dived,
overboard to the rescue of an English nurse
and soon had her on the deck of an escorting
destroyer. Then he swam to two more nurses,
held them up in his arms and kept himself
afloat with his feet until help arrived. Later-
on he rescued six Tommies, and only allowed
himself to be hauled on board the destroyer
when there was no one else to save. Then
once more he became a camel-man under
arrest for absence without leave. He refused
to reveal his name, and as his papers were at
the bottom of the sea there was no means
of ascertaining same. The first official record
of Morrison’s bravery received in Cairo was a
statement signed by eight E.F.C. men to the
effect that the Anzac under arrest had saved
the lives of several nurses and men. Morri-
son certainly did not serve a sentence for
being absent without leave, but it’s up to
someone to see that his gallantry is
more adequately recognised.
“Lock” Wilson, lately appointed to the
command of a Light Horse Brigade in
Palestine, is a well-known Queensland solici-
tor who, after some years of practice in
Townsville, settled down to work in Bris-
bane. He left Australia as second in com-
mand of the sth A.L.11., and succeeded to
the command on the Peninsula when Col.
Hubert Harris took the count there. Wilson
had previously smelt cordite in South Africa
with the 2nd Q.M.1., wherein he was a
trooper. In past days he was a keen foot-
baller, playing for several seasons with that
famous old Bananaland team, the Past
Grammars. I'.veil tire crossed sword and
baton have probably given him little more
pride than he felt the day his club team
beat IS. S. Wales 16 —6 at Brisbane in ’96.
1 layers like the \ eeches, Len Braund and
were among his opponents that day.
who, later, donned the khaki “jersey” and
heard the Last Whistle,
“K.B.'’: “Gipsy” Smith, the Welsh evan-
gelist, has been busy leading Billjim from
the primrose path beset with two-up and
amber dew. I always pictured him as of the
long-haired, ascetic
type, but when I saw
him at the Y.M.C.A..
Le Havre, I found
him a nuggety-built,
swarthy person, with
an aggressive dark
moustache. The sur-
prise temporarily put
me off his theme
whilst I tried to decide
if he’d look better in
a blue apron at the
butcher’s-block or on
a case giving the odds
at the course. His
strong suit is the
pathetic story; he
beats all the reformers
I’ve heard in the art
of using the tremu-
lous quaver or the
hushed whisper that
-sets the tender-hearted
groping for their
mops. He told a Lon-
don newspaper that
the greatest compli-
ment he had been paid
in his life was when
the Australians put
off a boxing-match to
hear him. A muscu-
lar Christian is
Gipsy, who believes the
front line is the place
to ease the path of the
troubled Tommy going
westward. Saw a
sketch of him wearing
a tin-lid having a pot
at Fritz’s line, so he
evidently reckons that
some sinners require to
have the gospel of
humanity biffed into them. Some time ago
he got the 0.8. E. distinction.
“Bill Bowyang”: The fact is sometimes
forgotten that, the war correspondent to-day,
though he is behind the lines, runs much risk
in securing his “copy.” This is proved by
the experiences of Charlie Bean (Aus-
tralia), Malcolm Ross (M.L.) and others
on Gallipoli. On more than one occasion
when the boys were in tight corners Bean
volunteered to carry ammunition, and after
we had been holding an isolated post for 36
hours at Suvla Bay Ross was the first man
to risk a dash across a sniper-infested hill,
so as to get first-hand information. Here
in Palestine, Gullet (Australia) has had a
couple of narrow shaves from death. The
correspondents in this war are heavily handi-
capped. _ They are as courageous and as
enterprising as those who carried a note-
book in previous scraps. If allowed they
would dash to the front trenches, but they
are held back from the line of action, and
although they may be allowed some degree
of liberty to gather casual news they are
restricted for their general information to
the statements which the military authori-
ties are pleased to give them. They all
work upon the same material although they
treat it differently.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Aeroplanes—the army’s eyes that see, and its
beaks that peck t” —.4 tear-correspondent.
As high from the sweep of the cloud-line as the
clouds than the cities are higher,
We leave in the wake of.our winging a trail that is
fretted with fire!
Unseen from the greyness below us, where the
cannonades challenge and roar,
We ride on the stream of the sunlight, on the breast
of the cloud-wrack we soar,
Through the folds of the fog - in the lower, through
the glare of the uppermost spaces,
We drive with the blindness about us and the buf-
feting wind on our faces.
The stave that the singing propeller, that the wind
in the wires is humming,
Chants death to the junctions below 11s, the camp
that lies dark to our coming,
Ihe threat that we bring- shall you wake to, the
doom of your fattest dominions
With the beat of our engines’ approaching, the slant
of the silk in our pinions—
Fate s falcons that watch where you cower, down-
swooping, reversing and checking—
The eyes of the army for seeing, the beaks of the
army for pecking!
Far down on the white of the roadways, the green
of the meadowland grasses,
A serpent winds laboring onward —the brown of the
column that passes!
A thrust on the piloting-handle, the rush that
descends, and decreases,
The joy of the hawk o’er the quarry, the click of the
bomb that releases,
Your vapor-balls ringing me harmless, my answering
gunner’s derision,
Burst limbers and screaming of horses, tin- shreds
of the shattered division,
Torn fragments that cumber the roadway, rude panic
unloosed and unknowing,
AN EXAMPLE.
THE LADY: “Now, tell us. soldier boy,
what’s the strength o' this ’ere camou-
flage."
THE BOY : “Well, y' see these blue bands
on me arms? Well, that’s camouflage.
I’m camouflaged as a wowser."
Blipc! fear that goes hotfoot for safety, nor stands
on its order of going!
Swift, spies of your camouflaged cannon, your bough-
:woven screens that dissemble,
Keen hunters we haunt your reserve-lines, your con-
, voys and troops that assemble!
Small respite or rest shall we grant you, poor leisure
for ruing or recking—-
The eyes of the army for seeing, the beaks of the
army for pecking !
A speck on the rim of tlic ether, a mote on the
distant blue showing,
A formlessness merging and forming, a shapelessness
shaping and growing!
Drag back on the lever! Short mercy to him who
shall dally delaying,
Scant shrift to the one who waits under while the
foemen may stoop to the slaying!
The palm unto him who shall bear it—the race to
the speediest runner;
Fate compass the course lest they ram us —God steady
the gun and the gunner!
Gone past! And a bare yard between us ? Cross-fire
that still rattles and dwindles?
Hard down to the right, lest we lose him where his
rocking plane circles and spindles!
A shot through the tank —and to earthward, in
smoke and a smother of fire,
Goes reeling a crumple of fabric, a tangle of metal
and wire!
Winged prophets are we of disaster, red bringers of
ruin and wrecking—
The eyes of the army for seeing, the beaks of the
army for pecking.

Although prospects look none too good
for the Hun there would still be hope
for him if he took to cannibalism.
Possibly he has done it under the rose;
certainly in the way of rape, mutilation, tor-
ture and burning people alive he has done
worse things. Organised cannibalism would
greatly increase the food supply, and thereby
make both the army and the civil population
more efficient. It would save a great deal of
difficult and expensive transportation, for
much victual would be on the spot even
during a retreat, though not nearly so much
as during an advance. It would give the
troops a new incentive to push the counter-
offensive ; they would advance with shouts
of “Victuals Ahead !” Desertion and surren-
ders would be reduced, for to leave the army
would also mean leaving the pantry, and
nobody desires to abandon a land of plenty
for a land of famine. The civil population
could be further “combed out,” fewer being
required for food-raising purposes, and there
would be a certain satisfaction in living on the
enemy, a device which the Huns have already
brought to some sort of perfection. Canni-
balism was certainly practised in Germany
during the Thirty Years’ War, which being a
religious war was specially violent, and it
lias existed in many places since till quite
recent times. Only one Australian bank man-
ager is supposed to have been eaten —Benja-
min Boyd, of the Royal Bank, who started to
build Boyd town on Twofold Bay as a rival
of Sydney, but was promptly snuffed out by
the One Big City influence. He met his
linish at Guadalcanal’ in the Pacific, where
the people were feeling hurt about some-
thing. One drawback about cannibalism is
its persistency. When once a person has
eaten a brother or a sister he never really
cares much for any other meat food. Another
disadvantage is that it retards settlement.
The law might restrict it in cities, just as it
does bushranging and cattle-stealing and
timber-felling without a license, but in the
great remote places where people could
least be spared, the habit, once acquired,
would be difficult to eradicate.
State-school teachers, who are about the
most valuable and the worst-paid public
officials that the Ma State possesses, grow
tired of being fed on the thistle of approba-
tion and the scant grass of compliment, not
to mention the dry husk of applause. In
other words, they think of inserting them-
selves under the Arbitration Act and secur-
ing a living wage from the Court. Nobody
has spoken with more enthusiasm about the
teachers than Education Minister James,
who off-handedly promised another £300.000
to Sydney University and laid the founda-
tion stone of a semi-detached brick cottage
the other day at St. Peters. So the idea is
to ask the Court to fix the teachers’ average
wage about half-way between what they get
and what Minister James says he is broken-
hearted because they don’t get, though he
adds that they ought to get even more than
that.

The conviction of Henry Cook, on a
charge of helping to steal two bags of
money belonging to the Vic. Government
Printing Office, must have greatly disturbed
the nest of thieves in the Vic. Railways, but
it brought considerable relief to those Labor
members who want the railways’ vote, but
want it unsupported by “crook” doctrines.
Henry Cook was assistant-secretary of the
Railway Employees’ Union. The maxim that
pilfering is no robbery, especially when
operations were confined to the railways,
radiated from the school of thought which
lie adorned, and the school was tainting the
service. Every well-wisher of Labor must
rejoice at the object-lesson which the luck-
less bag-snatcher has provided. IJis convic-
tion will do something towards clearing the
atmosphere. A blow to Bolshevism, it should
enable the large majority of decent members
to organise a reform in their union control.
Cook was handed 10 years’ penal servitude.
* * * *
The spectacle of the' worker pushing
money away is interesting. At the sluggish
arms-factory at Lithgow it was proposed to
pay a bonus to employees every week when
the output exceeded 1000 rifles, which is
quite a humble quantity and not calculated
to glut the world’s market. The union took
a ballot, and shoved the likely money aside
by a large majority. The scheme savored of
speeding-up, and the sacred principle of go-
slow was endangered. Unless the Govern-
ment arrests the capable artisan and gives
him a bonus by force its scheme is dead.
Victoria’s unbuilt Smell City is a curious
business. Seven years ago it was decided
that noxious trades must be moved out of
Melbourne, so the Government acquired
2SOO acres, which wasn’t nearly enough, at
Laverton (131 miles distant), which wasn’t
nearly far enough away. But then the Gov-
ernment couldn’t screw up its courage to
take a fairly large population any further
away, so it fixed the Smell City there in
the hope that the capital would spread and
absorb it. Next, it couldn’t bear to tear
population away even that little distance,
and it let the site for grazing purposes, so
that tanners, fellmongers, etc., might not
go there. Now Melbourne is refusing per-
mits for new factories of various kinds, and
blocking profit and progress and employ-
ment, because it can’t stand any more Smeil,
and is too dog-in-the-mangerish either to
part with the old Smell or let any other
place have the additional Smell.
Statistically tabulating the religious belief
of the citizen in Maoriland is a solemn job.
It must involve a tremendous amount of
clerical labor and incidentally cost a lot of
money, for the thing is done with meticu-
lous thoroughness. Whether it is all worth
while is another matter. After giving the
general results of the local census as it

affects sectarianism the statisticians plug
more comprehensively into the raw material
find present comprehensive tables of arith-
metic showing how many men, women and
kids belong to each sect; then it divides the
details up_ into neat columns showing the
numbers identified classified according to
ages of each sex and then of both sexes
together; and having perpetrated all this
proceeds to explain how many males there
are belonging to each sect in every county
and borough in the land, and finishes off
with the same particulars about the girls.
The fact that no Hebrews were discoverable

at Te Awamutu in the last count may sug-
gest that this ought to be a good place to
go with the spheres of Lombardy after the
war. And the circumstance that there is
one lady Baptist and two gentlemen Bap-
tists at TV aipawa seems to be tremendously
important. It is also an impressive inci-
dent that at the time of the census 49 male
Pi'esbyterians were travelling on night
trains. Most likely they were looking after
the 271 ladies who happened to be on .trains
after dark, of whom fully two objected to
explain their brand of belief. Some of the
denominations over yonder have full temples.
Some do not need a temple, their numerical
strength being relatively limited. For
instance, there is but one Calathumpian in
the length and breadth of the islands; one
female is addicted to the House of David:
there is one Glassite, one Hurleyite and one
Indefinite ; the Congregation of the religion
of Herald of the Morning, when they all
get together, is not less than three. They
beat the adherents of the Watch Tower by
one. The Church of Personal Works holds
two. They are men. There are two
Ranters on the premises. They are ladies.
One citizen returned himself as a “Stock.”
which seems to be something fairly new.
There are two Seekers after Truth, one Orto-
thorian, 13 Future Admonition of the Lord
followers, one Universal Hedonist and seven
Pilgrims. The last of the Particularists has
apparently gone west. Anyhow the statist
couldn't find him at the count. The
adherents of these “other” religions in M.L.
number less than 1000. split up into about
157 camps—all intently listening for the
Last Trump, and hugging quaint certain-
ties about the other side o’ Jordan with
pathetic trust that they are on a winner.
It has been enacted, very wisely, that red
flags and Hun flags and skull-and-cross-bone
flags must not. be flown in Australia without
permission. Now something might be done
about imported Australian flags. They are
a painfully erratic lot. The only reason why
any two of our imported flags are alike is
that the supply of blunders ran out.

“No. 2095” : Talking of conscription. The
Maoriland troops alongside our Light Horse
for the past six days have sent 60 men per
day back to a rest-camp, where they put in a
month recuperating. If they do not feel well
enough at the end of their month, they will
be given further time. As for the Aussies,
there are men here who have not been away
for 13 to 15 months, and are still hanging on.
For myself, I have been out for 10 months.
Anything doin’ at your end?

PEACE IN BETHLEHEM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The fine dust swam beneath our feet
Like seas of creamy slush;
AVe labored through the ruthless heat
Amidst the frantic crush ;
AVe grimly strove to reach the hills
Against the galling drouth,
AVhile torrid gusts increased our ills,
And smote us from the south.
The dark beset us like distrust,
No light of promise gleamed,
And like an adder in the dust
The writhing column seemed ;
The horses floundered through if all,
The waggons swirled behind,
Till we, beneath the choking pall,
AVere deaf and dumb and blind.
Each horse, it seemed, was nearly dead,
And shrinking ’neath its load,
When hoofs across the column-head
Assailed the mountain road ;
Then jaded “walers” ceased to grieve—
They pricked their ears to show
They’d bear their burdens all, and leave
The Jordan far below.
AA T e sniffed the fragrant mountain air,
The metal rang beneath,
And, like a blade, the old despair
AVas driven in its sheath.
Each man regained that goodly sight
Confusion ever mars,
And slowly, through the limpid night,
We rode beneath the stars.
The east awoke, and shyly fanned
The lifting sun ablaze,
And mellow gold caressed the land
That rang in olden days.
The Holy City seemed to rise
Above its ancient wall,
AVhile savage splendor laid its guise
A moment over all.
WORLDLY ADVICE.
PARISHIONER : "Do you think there should be
less extravagance in woman?”
THE CURATE: “Oh. no; merely less extrava-
gance in man.”
Then we rode out to Bethlehem,
What time a healing breeze
Made joyous song with twig and stem
Among the olive trees ;
And long before the sun had set,
AVe halted in a shade
That made us for a time forget
The cause of gun and blade.
Oh, peace was stealing from the west,
And stirring leaf and stem,
The day we laid us down to rest
1 u holy Bethlehem.
The grapes were clustered on the vine,
And all the thought of strife
AA as flooded with the warming wine
And happiness of life.

the sun-baked veldts of South Africa —on the snow-
clad Himalayas —in the sands of Egypt’s deserts, on
wind swept steppes of Russia and Siberia, in bush and
plain throughout Australia —all over the world, wherever
you find Motor Cars there also you will find the track of
the All Weather Tread.
Though Goodyear Tyres are sold in
every country in the world, they are
nowhere the lowest-priced tyres. Yet
the aggregate of Goodyear sales is
higher than any other single brand of
tyre. Motorists the world over have
realized that Goodyears give a lower-
cost-per-mile. It is this lower cost,
this better service shown by Goodyears
on all roads, in all countries, that has
made Goodyear the dominating tyre
value in the markets of the world to-day.
From whatever source Goodyear draws
its supply of materials, there a Good-
year man is on the spot, able at all times
to keep in touch with market conditions,
so that Goodyear can buy the best
materials to advantage.
Big production gives every scope for
lowering overhead costs in manufacture.
Money-saving machinery, standardised
manufacture, skilled specification, have
been fully developed in the produc-
tion of Goodyear Tyres.
Such a world market, such a universal
prestige, as Goodyear Tyres have won
is a double assurance to tyre buyers. It
is a prestige that must be maintained by
continued high quality. It is a market
that must grow by giving a uniformly
lower cost-per-mile on every Goodyear
sold. It is a reputation that must be
increased by the helpful, money-saving
service afforded by the many thousands
of Goodyear Service Stations and
Dealers scattered throughout the world.
Because Goodyear has a world-wide market, we can maintain extensive laboratories where all materials
are tested, new ideas evolved, experiments proven which make Goodyear a uniformly better tyre.

“M.”: The Australian doesn’t need his
clothes to make him distinctive; lie can be
picked, easily, even when in the slack gar-
ments of hospital, among an assorted crowd.
Shortly after I arrived at a casualty clear-
ing-station, where there were Canadian doc-
tors, American nurses. English orderlies and
a very mixed crowd of patients, the man in
the bed next to me said: “Aussie, aren’t you?
You can always tell an Aussie, somehow.”
This recognition tickled my pride, for I
didn’t consider myself so distinctly an Aus-
tralian ; but in my subsequent wanderings
through the hospitals I discovered that what
my neighbor said was correct, and the city-
bred Australian is as clearly hall-marked as
the man from the bush. The American in
pyjamas frequently does not place himself
until he speaks; the Canadian is much like
either an American (after he has spoken)
or an Englishman ; but the Australian shows
an easily detectable individuality. And, let
it be said, the Englishman who has been a
few years in Australia has his good share of
it. I can’t quite locate what the distinctive
quality is; but it’s there.
♦ * * *
Britain is trying these days to supply
not only itself but France, Italy and Portu-
gal with coal, and it is short of miners, be-
cause so many men have gone to the war,
and short of ships despite the hundreds that
it and its Allies are building. In fact there
is something like famine in view. In Aus-
tralia the Government has a scheme for
buying Coal with loan money and stacking
it up in order to keep the miners employed,
because it seems to have very little luck at
building ships. So it is missing the high-
priced markets for coal and wheat and meat
and ships and rabbits and other things all

at once. Of course the people who want to
paralyse this end of the anti-Hun alliance
concentrate their sluggishness on the ship
industry, but perhaps it might be possible
to pile some coal on a raft and tow it to
England. That stupendous obelisk, Cleo-
patra's Needle, was rafted from Egypt to
London, so there is a precedent.
“Jobber” (abroad) : The R.M.O. was very
irritable the other morning on sick parade,
and snorted at Billjim: “Would you come to
me, in civilian life, with a trifling complaint
like this?” “No,” drawled Bill; “I'd go to a
doctor.”
“Tasso”: The finest elocutionist I have,
ever heard was a small boy encountered
recently on a Sydney ferryboat. I was
reading a paper when I became aware of a
thin, pathetic figure standing at my elbow
with a mass of very ugly crochet-work dis-
played in an open suitcase. “Will you buy
some, please?” I had all the parcels I
could carry and
very little change:
so I shook my head
resolutely. But the
small boy didn’t
budge. Presently I
had to cease read-
ing and look him
squarely in the eye.
“But I have no
father!” he sighed.
Observe that he
wasn’t so inartistic
as to say his father
was a soldier who
had died fighting
for me. He merely
implied it. The
odds are his
father was a healthy
bloke out on strike
for higher wages.
Anyhow, I had to
shell out and the
young pirate moved
on. It wasn’t until
he had carefully
worked every pas-
senger on two seats
that a lion-hearted
citizen boun d e d
downstairs and saw
the engineer about
it. Presently a
deckhand came up
and touched the
young actor on the
shoulder just as he
was delivering his
great orphan
speech to a poorly-
dressed little typ-
iste. He was taken
downstairs and we never saw him again.
Perhaps they threw him overboard. A
small boy with his acting ability doesn’t
need a father.

“The Oldest Inhabitant”: The Australian
Golden Jubilee of one of the many R.C.
teaching orders, the Christian Brothers,
comes on shortly. Three Brothers opened
the first school at St. Francis’s, Lonsdale-
street, Melbourne, in Bishop Goold’s time,
when the venerable John Fitzpatrick was
V.G. and the handsome and eloquent Rev.
G. V. Barry parish priest. There
are now 36 communities in Aus-
tralia and M.L., with 50 schools
and 15,000 pupils. The order
was founded in Waterford, Ire-
land, in 1802, by Ignatius Rice,
a wealthy commercial man, who
retired from business and de-
voted his wealth to educational
purposes in Ireland. And apropos.
St. Francis’s was the first R.C.
Church established in Victoria.
At the time that the Christian
Brothers opened their schools
there were two clergymen of some
note attached to the church. One
was a reverend father who, like
Cardinal Manning, had been mar-
ried and was a widower with a
daughter. The other was a
homely little man, Father Lorden.
who “did” the gaols, etc. In the
’sixties a felon who was under
sentence of death for stabbing
was in Father Lorden’s charge
spiritually. Great exertions were
made to save the man from the
gallows, and they were successful.
When the priest heard the news
he exclaimed : “Ah, he’ll never be
so well prepared again.” An
Irish laborer once waited upon
the holy man to make arrange-
mentg for his wedding. “Sure, , your
wife is only dead two months!” “Well,”
replied the applicant, “she’s as dead as ever
she’ll be, Father ■”
“Bill Bowyang” (from the spot) :
About to be issued with horses, so as to reinforce
the Light Horse in Palestine, the curtain goes down
on the Imperial Camel Corps (Australian Section).
Some day the history of this corps will be pub-
lished, and it will be one of the most thrilling
narratives of Australian heroism. When the Senussi
rose in Nor’-West Egypt in December, ’l5, the
military authorities, owing to the dry nature of the
country inhabited by the Senussi, decided to estab-
lish a Camel Corps, and the task of forming this
unit was left to Lieut.-Colonel Smith, V.C., of the
Egyptian Army. This officer asked for four com-
panies of Australians, who had fought at Gallipoli,
and who were than stationed at Tel-el-Kebir. Each
battalion was asked to supply a given number of
men, qualifications being that they must be of good
character and first-class rifle-shots. During February,
’IC, the first two companies left for Solium, on the
fringe of the Tripoli border, and the following month
the remaining two companies left for posts between
Alexandria and Mem Matruh. There being some
difficulty in securing Australians to form further
companies, English and Scottish troops formed an-
other six companies, and the name of the unit was
changed from Australian to Imperial Camel Corps.
Later on another eight companies of Australians
and Maorilanders were formed. The first four com-

“A bit lonely for us girls, this wan' game.”
“You’ve said it! Look at what is left to
keep us company."
panics arrived on the Nor’-West frontier in time to
see the last phase of the Senussi rising, but they
spent several months patrolling the Libyan desert.
It was weary work, and the men began to complain
at being in what they termed a non-combatant corps.
August, ’lO, saw No. 4 Company transferred west
of the Suez Canal, and they were the first lot to
face fire. They struck a warm corner at Romani,
and were only rescued in time by a Light Horse
unit. No. 1 and 3 Companies then arrived from
the Nor’-West and joined ip the big trek towards
El Arisli. At Maghdaba the Camel Corps made
good, and their fine charge was the talk of the
army for weeks afterwards. Following this
success they added to their laurels at Rafa.
It was at the second attack on Gaza on
April 19, 1917, that the Australians and Maori-
larders crowned all their previous achievements. Six
companies were detailed to charge 21 miles over
open ground and carry a strong Turkish redoubt.
A tank took the lead and the boys followed. Just
as it reached the enemy’s trench a shell struck the
tank and it burst into flame. Two camel companies
found themselves surrounded by Turks, the odds
being about ten to one. Both of these companies
were practically annihilated. The Turks called upon
them to surrender, but they refused. The English
newspapers stated that this heroic incident was per-
formed by British eamelmen. Every man who took
part in it wore the Australian uniform. The remain-
ing Australian and M.L. companies suffered severe
casualties trying to rescue their comrades. Anzac
veterans afterwards stated that this fight was the
worst that they had taken part in. The capture
of Beersheba and a few other posts in the Jordan
Valley saw the last of the Camel Corps in action.
This unit, considering its strength, won more honors
and suffered more casualties than any other unit in
Egypt or Palestine. There’s room in Australia to
erect a monument to this unique and heroic band of
Anzacs,
In England the dear duchess and the
others who can afford to keep dogs are
endeavoring to excuse Ponto’s existence by
shearing him and converting his wool into
garments for humans. There is a society
for promoting the commercial use of poodle
wool. The idea deserves encouragement, if
only because it affords weak man an oppor-
tunity of putting to a better use the hair of
the dog that bit him.
* * *• *
The Intelligence Officer was giving evi-
dence at the Seven Irishmen interlude in
Sydney, and Mack, K.C., was trying him
out:—•
Have you any information about Robert Emmett?
—Yes. I think he was killed in a motor accident
lately at Darlinghurst.
Having stopped this, Mack got his second
wind and tried another: —
About this Wolfe Tone we heard of. Who was he?
—A man who was mixed up in the Dublin rebellion
last year.
“Eye-witness” forwards this:—
He was a dinkum Billjim, and in the old days
punched bullocks in timber-jinkers on the North
Coast. His seething hot expletives would split the
hide of the biggest rogue in his team, and he could
pilot any number of the beast through the densest
timber country in the north. But there were no
bullocks to listen to his explosive vocabulary in
France, and the transport column found him a job
behind a team of mules. When I met him his old
rattletrap was bogged in mud and slime up to the
axle, and he artistically used his whip for 20
minutes without the slightest effect on his stubborn
half-breeds. Then he defiantly sat on the front seat
of his waggon, and, to give his arm a much-needed
rest, swore from 40 different angles. But the
obdurate beasts wouldn’t budge an inch, though
Fritz’s shells were splashing mud all over them in
unhealthy showers. In despair Billjim got down
from his box seat, affectionately stroked each animal
in turn, talked to them as only a bullocky can, then
suddenly jumped in front of them and piteously
pleaded: “For God’s sake, come on—your King and
country call you!” And Tommies and Frenchmen
who were watching the performance cheered the
quadrupeds as they lunged into the traces and set
out for Berlin, while a grinning Aussie took t.he
salute from the box-seat.
* *- •* *
It being discovered that at least 400 young
men of Stepney (London) held bogus' mili-
tary exemption certificates, the matter was
traced to ft girl clerk, who said, in an
off-hand way, that she used to hand out
the forms and get chocolates in return.
Assuming the price was £1 per form,
which is little enough for forgery and trea-
son, it seems a very elastic girl who could
hold all that chocolate. Perhaps she took out
some of the money in motor-cars.
* * * *
It occurred on the journey up to Pales-
tine. The occupants of the railway com-
partment were still suffering from the effects
of an arduous week’s leave in Cairo. In the
morning at Belah they compared notes on
the platform. The Major told one of his
friends that he had a most unfortunate ex-
perience during the night. The train had
stopped with a jolt, and he had been thrown
from the upper sleeping-berth on to the floor
with terrific force. His friend said: “For
such a fall, old chap, you don’t seem to be
knocked about much. Are you sure you
really did fall?” “Well,” said the Major,
hastily, “we’ll leave it at that. I thought I
did.” Just then a sub. joined the group and
graphically described an exactly similar ex-
perience. “Oh,” said the Major, much
relieved, “then it was you that fell out during
the night! I knew that somebody had come
down wallop!”

“Camelero”: Brig.-General Ryrie was in
his tent in Palestine one evening when he
hard a Billjim exceeding the cursing limit.
The General went outside and spoke forcibly
to the wrongdoer. Just as he was re-entering
his tent some bloke yelled from a dugout:
“You’ve both had a go, and I declare it a
blanky draw!”

An “Adamax” Roof was put on this Building
because—the Architect knew all about the different types of roofing and, further, knew that the
man for whom he was preparing the plans was a particular man.
He had a big plant and he wanted it covered with a roofing that would give long service at low
cost.
Under such conditions the Architect knew there was only one choice, namely—to roof with
“Adamax” Roofing
because it gives longest service at a lower unit cost (the cost per sq. foot per year of service) than
any other roofing he could specify.
The Architect had before him the big orders that have recently been secured for “Adamax” Roofing,
and he knew that those “jobs” would not have been roofed with “Adamax” unless “Adamax” was
a roofing of a high standard of excellence.
Here is one order for “Adamax” —3500 sq. yds. ordered by the Sydney
Harbor Trust to roof Nos. 6 and 7 Wharves, Miller’s Point. Sea air
has no ill effect on “Adamax.”
Another of 5000 sq. yds. for Mine=buildings at Kandos, N.S.W. —because
it is a well=known fact that “Adamax” resists the ravages of chemical
fumes, gases and acids.
Other orders of note secured by “Adamax” include:
miles of “Adamax” Roof Covering being used on Wool=storage sheds erected in
Wentworth Park, Sydney, by Messrs. Stuart Bros, for the Central Wool Committee.
Again, recently, 13 miles of “Adamax” Roof Covering was ordered by the Imperial
Authorities in Perth for the West Australian Wool Stores.
22,000 sq. yds. for use on the Commonwealth Buildings at Molongo, Canberra.
20,000 sq. yds. on the Leeton Canning Factories.
13,200 sq. yds. for West Australian Government Freezing Works at Wyndham.
An order for 44,000 sq. yds. was placed for use on the South Australian Wheat Board
Buildings.
The Contracts for the N. S. Wales Railways for 1917=18, and again for 1918=19, were
secured for “Adamax” Roofing, the estimated requirements for the year being 25,000 sq. yds.
Secured because “Adamax” is a timeproof roofing that is not affected by heat, cold, wind, snow,
rain, etc.—because it costs less than one-third the price of Galvanised-iron, with a heavy saving-
in freight.
“Adamax” is supplied in rolls 36in. wide and 7 2ft. long, in three thicknesses: 1-ply (light), 2-ply
(medium) and 3-ply (heavy). Nails and cement for sticking the overlap where the roofing joins
are supplied free of cost with each roll.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Governor-General Ferguson on the sub-
ject :
We Avho know more or less about politics appre-
ciate the parly system as a stable instrument for
free government.
As “we” happened to be members of the N.
S. Wales Ministry, nobody Avas passed out
for interrupting. To that happy band the
system Avhich put them on the box-seal; natu-
rally enough looks as majestic and enduring
as Kosciusko. But his Ex. could reckon on
hearing A. Voice, Esq., if he worked off that
sort of patter on any reasonably representa-
tive gathering of the people Avho pay the hill.
This paper suggests to his Ex. that ho might
find it an interesting experiment to publicly
examine the innards of the party sysrem as
it operates in the Commomvealth before an
assemblage of Avorking Australians, and tak-
ing Avhat has transpired during, say, the
last ten years, and particularly during the
war period, disclose to the audience a feAV
reasons for continuing to regard the party
system as a stable instrument of free gov-
ernment.
If certain Labor politicians don’t “get
down to brass tacks” their crowd may yet
be known as the Indefiuite Party. They
have heard, as a matter of common report,
that Scully, the I.W.W. witness, was refused
a landing at San Francisco, allegedly because
he was an “undesirable,” but they don’t really
know. They have also heard that some Min-
isters belong to a syndicate which has been
'dealing in wheat certificates, but they have
no personal acquaintance with the matter
and make no direct charges. They learn that
a certain juryman was probably biased
against one of the I.W.W. incendiaries be-
cause he had given him the sack two years
previously, and as he must have kept the
fact in his mind ever since and nursed an
undying hatred, the trial was obviously null
and void. The Solicitor-General says that
the said juryman never employed or sacked
the said, incendiary. The same croAvd has
damaging confessions from some of the State
witnesses against the I.W.W. convicts, but
some are not signed and some not SAVorn to,
nor are they produced. One concrete fact is
that a Labor politician wants to be recognised
as Consul-General for the Bolshevik Govern-
ment in Russia, which is at war with the
British Empire, Australia included. Most
other things are haze and rumor.
If the Avar lasts another decade or two
the Australian State Parliaments and Gov-
ernments may economise in real earnest.
Some are making a start already. The other
day, for instance, only 22 legislators motored
from Victoria’s Parliament House to hand
the local representative of the Australian
Governors’ Union that weighty and lunatic
document called the Address-in-Reply. And
of the 22 only one, Davies, President of the
Council, was tricked out for the occasion.
The Speaker of the Assembly left his alpaca
dressing-gown and his horse-tail thatch at
home. Also the blessed mace Avas left in
the wardrobe —and when Victoria’s statesmen
give this holy relic the go-by things are get-
ting serious.
Australia is to have a real War Minister
in London, and as Australia House, one of
the most magnificent and most mortgaged
buildings in the city, is wanted for the High
Commissioner, the biggest of our seven
Ambassadors, there has been an idea of buy-
ing St. Paul’s to accommodate the neAv Great
Man. There will probably be an objection,
however, to parting Avith the sacred edifice,
especially on an lOU, and it may be neces-
sary to put up with Buckingham Palace.
Plain General Smuts, Avho War Ministers
in Europe on ’behalf of South Africa, will
probably have a goatskin tent alongside.
"Ettie Rout” from France:—
Two good Australians (Mrs. Herring and Mrs.
Doig, of Sydney) had an illuminating experience at
the Third Conference of the British Dominions’
Woman Suffrage Union, held in London this month.
The programme announced: “List of Speakers from
Overseas Incomplete”; and I guessed it Avould re-
main so. It did. Mrs. Herring wasn’t allowed to
make her speech on liow to combat V.l). in the armies
at all. She was pulled up within five minutes
by the High Priestess. The Australian delegate
proposed a sensible amendment advising the Union
to study the advisability or otherwise of regularly
supplying prophylactics to soldiers on leave ; but it
was ruled out of order. On the other hand, the
Maoriland W.C.T.U.’s motion condemning the issue
of disinfectants to soldiers as “utterly debasing” and
“an unwarrantable insult to the great majority of
TEE DEVELOPMENT.
CROWN PRINCE: “ Perhaps he is beginning to think he will never be strong enough to
crush the Allies, papa.”
KAISER: “But, perhaps, my son, he is beginning to think he is strong enough to crush
us.”
men” was carried almost unanimously. In Paris
another sort of vote was taken —among over 30,000
soldiers (Anzacs, Canadians, South Africans and
B.E.F. men), to whom the “unwarrantable insult”
was offered: one soldier in every thousand rejected
it. The Y.M.C.A. in France does not appear to
believe any longer that morality is supported by
uncleanliness; hence we have prophylactic depots
in all Y.M.C.A. hotels, etc., as Avell as in the British
Army and Navy Leave Clubs.
“William” discusses the claims: —
“F. Born” (B. 8/8/’18) says that Smuts, and not
Hughes, is the parent of the Monroe Doctrine for
the Pacific. As a matter of fact the doctrine las
been in full working order ever since Australia had
politics of her own. The annexation of the islands
was considered and discussed in N. S. AVales in
1871, Hughes at the time being a small boy of
seven years and Smuts an infant of 12 months.
Martin (who was Premier in 1872) gave up the
idea for Constitutional law reasons. A few years
later John Robertson, as Colonial Secretary, put in a
strenuous communication to Downing-street, in
which he demanded that Great Britain should “take
possession, not only of the magnificent island of New
Guinea, but of the islands of New Britain, New
Ireland, and the chain of islands to the N.E. and E.
of New Guinea, from Bougainville Island to San
Gristoval, the group of the New Hebrides and the
adjoining islands, and the Marshall, Gilbert and
Ellice islands, because the occupation by foreign
Governments of islands in the immediate neighbor-
hood of our coasts, and on the very tracks of our
ocean communication with the Mother Country
might, and probably would, be in time of war fatal
to our free navigation of the sea which adjoins our
territory.” Hughes has discovered nothing which
Avas not foreseen by old Jack Robertson and his
friends more than 40 years ago.
The weary old question of whether a
settler upon land resumed for occupation
purposes by the State should reside on the
property is again being Avrangled over in
Vic. The fact that there is no possible argu-
ment against compulsory residence is, of
course, a mere detail. The proposal of the
Lawson Government in a Closer Settlement
Act Amendment Bill is to abolish Clause 69
of the original Act, which impds.es upon the
selector the obligation of eight months’ resi-
dence in the year, and to substitute therefor
that the purchaser of a block of closer-settle-
ment land must make a statutory declaration
that he owns no other such allotment—a
farcical arrangement that would turn the
whole close-settlement theory into hash. In-
cidentally this is alleged to be of assistance
in repatriation, which is proceeding at such a
furious rate in Vic. that 90 soldiers have
been put on the land in a year, and a Royal
Commissioner is investigating “the drift to
♦the city.” The little finger of the land-jobber
is stronger than an army corps—and Lawson
ought to commemorate the incident by plant-
ing a symbolical statue somewhere.
One of the simple but annoying forms of
Parliamentary GoA T ernment is that essential
documents like the annual railway balance-
sheet can’t be issued until they have been
“laid on the table of the House.” This doesn’t
matter if the House is sitting, but if it is
aAvay for a long rest there is an irritating
delay. The Speaker always takes the table
home Avith him when there is a lengthy
adjournment, so that the floor underneath
it may be washed, and though the door-
keeper might easily lay the paper on a chair,
with the mace on top of it to prevent it
blowing away, that would be contrary to
precedent.
“0.K.”: The preamble of the N. S. Wales
liacles Union Oongress makes me SQuirm;-
(. apitalism can only bo abolished by the workers
unities in one class-conscious economic organisation
to take and hold the means of production by revolu-
tionary industrial and political action. Reyolutionan
action means the establishment of social ownership
by the whole community, etc.
Well, this country has been very considerably
run in the past by the chosen nominees of
Trades Unions, and where are the co-opera-
tive factories, warehouses and shops, to
begin with? Beef trusts and sugar trusts,
and all sorts of combines from which the
outside capitalist suffers in common with the
rest of the community were to be suppressed
by the Trades Union representative in office,
but the Millennium didn't eventuate. Mean-
while the principle of co-operation, wherebv
the producer, manufacturer, shopkeeper anil
consumer would be blended in one harmoni-
ous socialist, received no impetus whatever.
Labor Government, created by trades-union
forces, was too class-conscious, apparently,
to move in the direction of abolishing com-
mercial class distinction. The co-operative
principle aims at making every demanding
consumer a partner in every form of supply
business, but the precious preamble of the
N.S.W.T.U.C. doesn’t include even the word
co-operation in its revolutionary blather.
Casual news paragraph of August 22:
Mr. Holman.... expected that there would be no
difficulty in carrying out the proposal to spend
£3,500,000 [loan money] on public works during
the year.
Trust him !
Bricks are frequently thrown at civil ser-
v&nts because of their dislike of anything
approaching undue haste; yet occasiotfally
they heat the pistol. Arthur Griffith, ex-
Minister for Works and ex-other things, told
the N. S. Wales Royal Commission on the
Public Service that when he contemplated
emulating the Children of Israel in the State
brickmaking industry he wrote to the heads
of the Departments expressing the hope that
they would use his output. “I received a
very courteous note from one of the heads,”
said the witness, saying that he had had the
bricks tested, that they were entirely unsatis-
factory, and that he could not use them. I
thanked him for his courtesy and said that
as yet we had not burned a brick.” Pharaoh
made the followers of Moses make bricks
without straw, but this wizard produced
intangible bricks as yet in the womb of
Time, so to speak.
In politics the art of liow-to-put-it-off
ranks next to the art of how-not-to-do-it-at-ali.
Last year the Victorian Government was
petitioned to regulate the hours of business
for fruit-shops—Dago and otherwise, but
mostly Dago—which are still licensed to re-
main open all the time, on every day of the
Aveek. The petition Avas ’ ignored on the
ground that it didn’t represent a majority of
fruiterers (Dago and otherwise). Probably
the Dagoes as a body were not in favor of it.
The Government couldn’t afford to continue
to ignore the fruit-shop scandal, hoAvever ;
so something had to be done, and the Min-
ister of Labor has done it. He has given
instructions for the preparation of a regula-
tion fixing 7 p.m. as the hour for the clos-
ing of fruit and vegetable shops during the
five coldest months of the year. But in
order that no malcontent Dago may be taken
by surprise the regulation is not to come
into force before next winter. Moreover, to
prevent any possible misunderstanding as to
the date of the promised reform, the Minister
arranged not to pass the regulation until
early in October. Here endeth the first les-
son in the art of how-to-put-it-off.,
The United States is alleged to have
adopted the simple, logical idea of prohibiting
voluntary enlistment and relying on compul-
sory service only. Under compulsion the
followers of .Tudd and Brookfield and Pren-
dergast and others Mve to go to the Front
and be killed or captured just as numerously
as the Carmichael kind of men. Voluntary
enlistment, on the other hand, takes an
undue proportion of the Carmichael sort
away from local politics and leaves an undue
proportion of the Judd variety in charge of
things. If Hughes had only had the courage
of his opinions, and shox’ed a compulsory-
service law through Parliament without re-
gard for the chances of the next election,
quite a lot of the No crowd Avould have been
out of his way before the election and would
have given him no trouble. Instead, he com-
promised on an arrangement by Avhich plenty
of his friends were to be buried beside the
Somme, but none of his enemies.
“Chron.” : Adelaide was the first city in
Australia to have municipal government.
The Act authorising it —the first municipal
luav in S. Aus. —was passed on August 19-
1840, by Governor Gawler and his Executive
Council, and the first city council election
Avas held on 81st October the same year.
James Hurtle Fisher was the first mayor.

COMSTOCK’S “DEAD-SHOT” WORM
PELLETS.
A SAFE, SURE AND RELIABLE SPECIFIC FOR
THE ERADICATION OF WORMS IN CHILDREN
AND ADULTS.
The general symptoms of worms are a
tendency to pick tlie nose and a sensation of
itching in the anus. Other symptoms are
nervous affections, such as fretfulness, irri-
tation of temper, wakefulness or disposition
to excessive sleep, disturbed sleep, and grind-
ing the teeth, sudden starting out of sleep as
if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic move-
ments of the eyelids, dilated pupils, per-
verted vision, temporary blindness and deaf-
ness. General convulsions are not infre-
quent in children, and symptoms resembling
water in the head have been ascribed to
worms, and have ceased on their expulsion.
The long round or stomach worm is the
commonest kind of worm from which man-
kind suffers, and is of a light, transparent
color, resembling the ordinary ground worm,
except that the extremities are more sharply
pointed than the ground worm.
Young people are more subject to these
worms than middle-aged or elderly people.
They live in the bowels, and sometimes make
their way into the stomach and throat, caus-
ing sickness, vomiting and choking. Gener-
ally one or two would be the most a person
would be afflicted with, but sometimes a
much larger number is met with. The length
varies from four to eight inches, but young
ones an inch to two inches long are also
found. The first thing to do is to rid the
system of the worms, and Comstock’s “Dead
Shot” Worm Pellets, taken according to
directions, are an effective remedy for the
thorough eradication of the long round or
stomach worm —the common enemy of the
child, the youth, the middle-aged and aged.
A light, nourishing diet, out-of-door exercise,
and. if possible* a change of air will greatly
improve the general health.
Threadworms or pinworms are of very
common occurrence in children. They are
very small, from one-sixth of an inch to half-
an-inch in length, and resemble cotton
thread —they are sometimes called seat
worms, and reside in the lower bowel. The
chief symptoms of this worm are severe
local itching, restlessness and irritability, a
frequent desire to urinate, and picking at the
nose; loss of appetite and anaemia alre also
observed. To get rid of the worms and theii
eggs their nests also must be removed, and
that requires a specific remedy. Comstocks
“Dead Shot” Worm Pellets, taken according
to directions on an empty stomach, followed
by a dose of opening medicine, will succeed
where others' fail.
Comstock's “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are packed with full directions, and are for
sale by chemists and stores generally, at
Bs. 6d. per packet, or six packets for 205..
and if unobtainable locally will be mailed
post free on receipt of price. Prepared only

AN AUSTRALIAN PRODUCT.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills have been manufactured entirely in Australia for the
past sixteen years, and it is safe to say that nowhere in any country is a better pill made, both as
regards hffih-orade ingredients, splendid efficiency and general appearance. They are packed in
the well-known Amber Bottle, not in cheap wooden or cardboard boxes, and therefore are
unaffected by climatic changes and reach the Public in perfect condition. It may be stated also
the ownership of this preparation is all British, but it is not foi these reasons the mei its of
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are urged on the attention of the Public (although
o-ood in themselves), but rather for the reason that they are a high-grade preparation effective for
all classes of the community, both rich and poor. A millionaire can get bettei at an\
price to aid in the digestion and assimilation of his food. They cleanse the* system, purify the
blood, and are a safe, certain and reliable remedy for all complaints arising from over-eating or
over-drinking, and from any other cause that has dislocated the digestive machine. They are
sold at a price within the reach of all.


Martin’s Pills are sold by all chemists and
stores. Ladies recommend them. Be sure

BILLJIM : “ Well, this is red ’of. Here's me
been practising bayonet fightin' all
these months, and then youse go and
turn a bloke down like this.”
“Melaleuca” : “Wart” (B. 25/7/18) states
that the Tassie abo. used no throwing-stick, hence
his spear did not do much damage. lie is quite
right about the throwing-stick being a missing link,
but he is not so about the effects of the spears.
These were generally long, up to 15ft., carefully
straightened by the manufacturer. When making
them he used his teeth as a vvee and outstretched his
arms to bend the spears to the required alignment.
The points were hardened in the fire. To make up
for the throwing-stick the abo. of the Speck used to
make his spears very thin, in order that they might
be grasped between the forefinger and thumb. In
this way a spin was imparted to the spear similar to
the spin of a modern rifle bullet. This had the
effect of carrying- the spear a longer distance and
making greater precision. If “Wart” consults the
old records of the “black war” he will note that
these spears could be used to good effect in order
to reduce the population. There are seven excellent
authentic specimens of these weapons in the Hobart
Museum.
“C. Coral”: In some of the islands of
Torres Strait, when it is
decided to give the cocoa-
nuts a rest for a year or
two to persuade them to bo
more fruitful in bearing,
they go in for an elaborate
ceremony which they call
“shutting” the cocoanut.
The owner of the palms,
with all his numerous rela-
tives, friends, neighbors and
their dogs, roll up in full
force on the appointed da}-.
After a kai-kai (no native
function from a christening
to a funeral is complete
unless they make a “little
bit feast”) the men swap
opinions and then get to
work. Bamboo and plaited
cocoanut leaf are first manu-
factured—something of a
cross—and then the coun-
cillors, in uniform or white
pants and red guernsey,
erect the symbols at the
corners of the plantation. 1
After that no one dare touch
so much as a dropped
cocoanut skin. In the olden
days the punishment for
transgression of the unwrit-
ten law regarding the vio-
lation of the “shut” patch
was the prompt passing out
of the offender per medium
of club or some other handy
weapon ; but now, of course,
there is nothing so drastic.
All the same, the tradition
is regarded as binding, and
even the dusky proprietor
and his household have to
go further afield when it
comes to arranging the
menu for the day, or shout-
ing visitors a cocoanut shandy.
“Pedess” : The boss was clearing, and his
assistant was a new arrival. Cutting and
grubbing was proving slow and tedious, and
Tony was surprised by the curt order to “Go up and
get the dog.” “Er-er—which dog?” he drawled.
“Why, the dog and chain!” yelled his exaspe-
rated employer. Tony fled and was gone about half
an hour. He reappeared towed by two yelping-
hounds, and shouting, “You didn’t mention which
one you wanted, so I brought them both.”
* * * #
“Boree Bill”: This beats all I have seen
on the Barcoo. A well-known identity had been
having a good long spree, too long to be of any use
to him, for he ended up by hanging himself in a
police cell a strip of blanket after having failed
to cut his throat in the back yard of the pub. The
hotelkeeper handed him over to the police, and then
when the man on the jag had hanged himself he (the
publican) turned to and made a coffin for the body,
boxed it in and carted the remains to the cemetery.
But even that wasn’t the end of his con-
sideration for his late customer. He read the burial
service over him! So no man need be afraid of
being neglected out on the Barcoo, if he can find a
publican who will supply him with drink till he
gets the horrors and blots himself out, then make
his coffin, carts him to the boneyard and conducts the
burial service.

“Merrigal”: Re “Ida D.’s” par. (B.
l/8/’18). “The Myall” was the name of the present
Tomingley before the latter was a goldfield, and a
portion of old Tomingley station (Peak Hill dis-
trict),- which, like Bulgandrarnine adjoining (bulgun,
a boomerang; derra, hand; mine, a blackfellow) was
occupied in the ’forties by John Newell Gilmour, of
Bathurst (N.S.W.). The Croft brothers, from Dubbo
side, had the first claim; and Donald McPhail, of
Bathurst, followed. In the Wiradjuri tongue, which
obtained in the district concerned, dthollon means
tongue (dth sounded like th in than) ; dthom-mol-in,
writhing; dthom-min-bil, poison, something done by
death-adder; and dthom-miny, a death-adder.
Another local word for the same reptile is thamin,
and so the blacks say tahrningooli (place of death-
adder). The Kamilaroi terminal bri (place of) has
equivalents in Wiradjuri, in bone and bah. Thus
Gulargambone, place of galahs; Girilambone, place
for stars; Quambone, place of mists; Weemabah,
place of standing fire; Warregenbah, place for briga-
low trees. Collymongle (the station taken up by
W. IV. Bucknell in the ’thirties is intended, I pre-
sume), in the Moree district (N.S.W.), where the
Kamilaroi language prevailed, meant, according to
the interpretation of two of its best exponents, the
Reverends IV. Ridley and Archdeacon Charles Green-
awav, broadwater, from kooli (water) and mun-
.gool (expansive). Also, gurra was the word for
spider, while the primary signification of Boggabri
was place of creeks—bukki, creek: bri, place of.
Incidentally, the Royal Anthropological Association of
Australasia, much to its credit, has gqpe to great pains
to secure, with due regard to the dialect peculiar to
their respective districts, the translation of our

“Stargazer”: Two prospecting parties had
come into Crowther from the long swish of the
Petticoat Hills in the course of the. afternoon, and
the front of the Mechanics’ Institute was littered
with much choice paper advertising the “Blue Bells,”
a vaudeville collection of such vivacity that “Blue
Belles” might have been considered a more illumi-
nating title. Especially conspicuous among the
posters were the colored pictures of Bella Bell, the
Morning Magpie, a sumptuous serio-comic who gave
practical demonstrations of the almost inconceivable
fact that so much woman could go into so little
clothes. Macnaughton’s party and Ivyver’s party fore-
gathered and drank plenteously, and at eight
charged into the Crowther Mechanics’ Institute, and
took front seats, of which there were plenty to
spare. They found a tall man in black,* whose
dinners obviously disagreed with him, talking about
the insufferable attributes of beer. This man con-
tinued to dwell upon beer’s intolerable qualities.
For hours and hours he talked, and eventually Mac-
naughton arose and said: “I say, ole feller, be a
sport. Shut up now, ’n’ give the Mornin’ Magpie a
look-in.” The tall mat in black expatiated on the
essential depravity of beer for further teons, and then
Kyver arose. “We’ve arst veh t’ cut it like a
gennleman, ’n’ give the ladies a charnee,” said he.
“We won’t speak to you agin.” But nothing hap-
pened, excepting that the long, dank man insisted at
great length on the inalienable iniquity of brewed
chink, and then everybody went home. Really the
prospectors had dropped in on a pleasant Friday
mg-ht with a teetotal evangelist named Cox the
first appearance of the Blue Belles being fixed for
the following evening. The diggers were too wrapped
up in matters of graver import to discover their
error, however, but they did discover that Miss Bella
Bell was staying at their hotel, and thev assured her
slily and often: “It’ll be all right to night. We’ve
fixed him!” “You jes’ go ’head,” said Macnaugh-
ton, “we’re goin’ to see you get a fair deal. That'll
be about all. You leave it to us.” On the Saturday
the Blue Belles brought off their entertainment before
a delighted crowd, none more delighted than the
respective parties of Maenaughton and Ivyver. Kvver
congratulated Miss Bell on behalf of his party.
“What ’id we tell yeh, Miss?” said lie. “We
accounted for the bloke with the endless jaw well
’n’ truly. There was nothin’ of him crowdin’ out
the girls this trip—what-o ! ” It was not till Sunday
noon that the teetotal specialist was rescued from
the SOft. dry hole at Shinbone into which the pros-
pectors had carefully lowered him at 3 p.m. on
Saturday.

“Pick”: When Peter Gehl, a Jugiong
(N.S.W.) hunter, undertook a contract to supply a
Melbourne furrier with 1000 lyre-birds’ tails, he
selected the jungles of the Jeremiah Forest, near
Gundagai, for the offensive. For weary weeks his
success was rotten. The lyre is the most wary fowl
of the Australian wilds, and to stalk him is a sheer
impossibility. Then Peter lobbed upon the scheme*
that enabled him to complete the contract inside a
month. Using his powers of mimicry to imitate the
love-call of the lyre, he at the same time danced a
tail, fastened to the end of a long sapling, from
behind a bush. Every male bird within hearing
came to knock the supposed serenadcr off his dancing
plot, and Pete did fearful slaughter with his pea-
ordnance.

“Silas Snell”: John Soft, of Min Min,
wanted to sell his house and lands, and advertise-
ments in Ballarat and metropolitan papers brought
along a possible purchaser in the person of Don
Mc-Don, a Western District farming man. Donald
ran an experienced eye over the paddocks and the
surroundings, studied the elements, and turned
'to John Soft. “Twenty-two puhd the acre!” said
he. “I wadna gi’ ye more. There isna a tree
whereby a man could hang hisself. There isna a
pool in which a man could droon hisself.” Then
up spake John Soft, with the seriousness the subject
demanded, urging the advantages. “But did yeh
overlook the railway runnin’ right by the hack pad-
dock? Folks hereabouts are using that for prefer-
ence.”

“Melos”: The “tailed spider” mentioned
by “N. or M.” (B. 27/6/’18) is not a spider, but
a springtail-—a primitive creature widely distributed
yet rarely seen owing to its habit of secluding
itself under stones, bark, etc. It is an unlovely trifle,
midway between a scorpion and a spider in shape,
and colored in harmony with its immediate surround-
ings. Most of the members of this order have a
peculiar spring arrangement working on the principle
of the “jack-jumper” made by children from the
wish-bone of a ebook, and consisting of a kind of
fork, under the abdomen, with the prongs projecting
forward and held in a clamped position by little

projections. When the creature wishes to move out
of harm s way, it simply releases the “catch” (pre-
sumably by inflating the body) and the spring, work-
ing automatically, does the rest. Don’t know how
far the springtail hurls itself, nor what keeps it in
its desired course.

IF WE HAVEN’T THE GRIT TO GO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They came from the South and they came from the
West
And across the plains from Hay,
From • the towns and the runs tl?at are further out,
And they’re off to join the fray;
And our hearts beat fast as the boys, swung past,
And the drums beat fast and slow,
But what will they say us they march away
If we haven’t the grit to go ?
“They’re better at home,” they’ll say, they’ll say,
“If they haven’t the grit to go away,
To mash the girls, and brush their curls,
And watch the pumpkins grow,
If they haven't the grit to go, you know,
If they haven’t the grit to go.”
We saw the chaps in the army caps
And the puttees all spick and span,
And we waved our hats and marched beside
And the children joined the van.
The ladies blushed and the ladies smiled,
And we all enjoyed the show;
But what will the ladies think of vs
If we haven’t the grit to go?
“They’re better at home!” they’ll smile and say,
“Much better at home l” they’ll say, to-day,
“To milk the cows and feed the sows
And hear the rooster crow—
I? they haven’t the grit to go, you know,
If they haven’t the grit to go.”
We stamped our feet, for we’re glad to meet
The lads who are risking death.
We are over the age, so we take the stage
And squander a lot of breath,
And the band will play and the parson pray
Where the big IClbertas grow ;
But we haven’t the luck or we haven’t the pluck,
Or we haven’t the grit to go.
And tPf did our best to enlist the rest
To tackle the job for us;
And I am as bad as the worst of them
And that’s why I am writing thus,
And I can’t be blamed if I feel ashamed
(For my heart is sinking low).
Be it wrong or right I will blush to-night
For I haven’t the grit to go.
“I am better at home,” I’ll say, I'll say,
“I am better at home to-day,
To drift, and drift as a dreamer drifts,
With my feet as cold as clay;
For I haven’t the grit to go, you know,
I haven’t the grit to go.”

Boots ore Boots,
hut there’s a mighty big difference in wearing
quality. When you buy
MURDOCH’S BOOTS
WITH
ARMOURITE SOLES
you can depend on double the wear of
ordinary boots. Why? Well, just because
“Armourite” is tanned by a special process
that toughens and strengthens the leather
without destroying its pliability. There’s a
reason why
“ARMOURITE” SOLES
will Outwear
Two Ordinary Soles.
Twice the wear means half the cost, because
“Armourite” Boots cost no more than
ordinary boots. Take the hint and cut your
footwear bills in two by wearing “Armourite”
Boots. They are made in a variety of pleas-
ing shapes to please all tastes —smart, ser-
viceable and comfortable. Uppers are high-
grade Box Calf and Glacti Kid, and the

‘Azack”: It is astounding how few people
on the land (and off the land) know which birds are
useful and which are destructive. J. B. Cleland,
Microbiologist of the Department of Public Health’,
N. S. Males, has just compiled a publication giving
the result of an investigation into the stomach and
BRAINS!
FIRST BEER-EATER : "Who’s that cove?”
SECOND DITTO: "That? That's one o' the cleverest blokes in the city 'E won a thou-
sand in tolls about a gear ago."
crop contents of Australian birds, from which it
would appear that our feathered friends and enemies
fall conveniently into four distinct classes ; namely,
useful birds, pests, birds of doubtful character and
birds which arc neither good nor bad, as follow:
Useful : magpies, magpie-lark, butcher-bird, pectoral-
rail, plovers, straw-necked ibis, owls, mopokes, dollar-
birds, kingfishers, cuckoos, swallows, jacky-winter
robins, fly-catcliers, fly-eaters, etc., cuckoo-shrikes
and caterpillar-eaters, ground-thrushes, scrub-wren,
coachwhip-bird, twelve apostles, white-fronted and
tri-colored chats, tits, wrens and wood-swallows
native-thrushes, tree-runners and tree-creepers, dia-
mond-birds, honeyeaters, ground-lark, grey jumper
white-winged chough. Pests: the starling, the spar-
row, silver-eye, hawks, parrots and cockatoos, the
bee-eater. Of doubtful character: the crow, (this
bird is said to be almost equally good and had, and
local circumstances should be taken into consideration
before destroying it). Of no economic importance
(neither useful nor harmful) : the quail, pigeons and
coves, water-birds (dottrells, coots, stilts, grebes,
ducks, herons, etc., excepting the straw-necked ibis
—vide useful birds).
“Jay Pay”: Beware of bush vets, who
recommend cowdung as a good poulticing medium
and dressing for a wound. One trial with it will
convince the credulous. I have seen otherwise-
healthy wounds rendered quite septic by one appli-
cation of the muck, and to say the least of it, it is
an abomination in or about a wound. If you need a
poultice use bran or linseed.

“J.N.A.”: Professor Perkins, Director of
Agriculture in South Aus., is a firm believer in the
olive, and is doing much to popularise its cultiva-
tion. He advocates the planting of the tree plenti-
fully m the western districts of the State, where
wheat and slieep are practically the only products at
present. In support of this advocacy, he has had, and
is having, planted at the recently-established Govern-
ment Experimental Farm at Minnipa, groves of olives
—some half-dozen rows around each paddock of the
farm. A recent visit there showed that the trees
weie flourishing and that the nursery was well
stocked for further planting. They are, of course,
wire-netted to protect against rabbits.
‘Te TV hare” : The Bermagui mystery of 38
years ago is solved at last, at any rate to some
people s satisfaction, and the aborigines are debited
with the crime. Frank McCaffrey, of Wollongong
(N.S.W.), elicited this solution from one McNamara,
who was camped on the Montreal gold-field (about
three miles from Bermagui, South Coast) at the time
of the tragedy. Montreal is about 14 miles distant
rom Mystery Point. A blackfellow (it is stated)
called at McNamara’s camp, exhibited “sovereigns,
half-sovereigns and nuggets in plenty,” and “wished
to dispose of a pair of binoculars.” The police were
interviewed and apprised of these facts, but being at
the time liot-foot on another clue apparently didn’t
act on McNamara’s information. But that the abo-
rigines committed the crime, carried out, as was the
murder of Lamont Young, Schneider and the two
fishermen of Ulladulla must have been, with great
secrecy, skill and diabolical cunning, I for one refuse
to believe. They may, perhaps, have been accesso-
ries after the fact, and the silence of such of them
as knew too much may have been bought, with gold
and trinkets taken from the murdered men, but no
more. I visited Mystery Point, the spot at which
Lamont Young and his companions vanished into
space, a few years ago, and while in the vicinity
talked with several persons who were resident in the
district at the date of the tragedy. The information
resolved itself into the following theories and asser-
tions:—•
(1) The party led by Young (who was a geologist
and mining surveyor) were examining caves alleged
to exist in the cliffs about Mystery Point, and were
choked to death by foul gases. Searches made have
already disproved this theory.
(2) The four men were kndnanped by the crew of
a vessel m want of sailors and taken to some distant
country Unlikely, and, if true, would have been
proved long ago.
(3) According to one deponent, a half-emptied tin
of jam was found beside a fire which still smouldered
on a beach at Mystery Point the morning after the
tragedy. The jam, _it is alleged, was found to be
mixed with strychnine. Four men could hardly be
poisoned offhand without there being* some traces of
a struggle for life, nor would so damnatory a piece
of evidence have been left in full view by the perpe-
trators of a crime. 1
W AH sails and cordage were gone from the boat
used by Young and his mates, which was found
jambed against a large rock close in shore. One side
ot the boat was stove in. Deduction: the bodies of
t] he murdered men were wrapped in the sails, bound
with the cordage and cast into the sea, weighted
with heavy stones. In all probability (irrespective
of the mode in which the crime was committed) the
bodies of the four men were disposed of in some such
manner as this. Some assert that the boat’s side was
purposely smashed in in order to convey an impres-
sion of shipwreck.
The boat capsized and the four men were
drowned and their bodies devoured bv sharks. Un-
Jlk <”T- The sea was calm on the day of the tragedv.
(6) On the night of the happening one man, it 'is
strongly asserted, came from Mystery Point towards
Montreal carrying a large sack. He crossed Wallaga
Lake, a large inlet between the Point and Montreal,
disappeared. This man’s name has never come
out, but it is said, on good authority, that Young’s
theodolite and certain other items of his property
were, some months afterwards, offered for sale in
Melbourne. Schneider, too (Young’s field-assistant),
was said to have been seen again after the tragedy,
hut this assertion has never been confirmed.
The fact that not the slightest evidence of a death-
struggle could be found either in the boat or about
the Point is most remarkable. Young for a time
taught a geology class at a school I attended, and is
embalmed in memory as a powerfully-built man,
standing over six feet in his socks; not a man to
give up life easily. His mates were men in their,
prime. In any fight with aboriginals there would
have been dead on both sides, and probably blood-
stains and other evidences of a struggle difficult to
entirely conceal.
"Mac Gamba”; He was a young married
man, a shop-asSistant by day and a poultry-farmer
of the back-yard type by night. A friend who was a
successful exhibitor at local shows advised him that
his beloved Black Minorcas would have no chance of
a prize at the Show with scaly legs. Kerosene would
cure them. A tin was cut in halves and about fin.
of oil poured in. In the dark hours he crept to
the fowlhouse with his kerosene'and a lighted candle
and proceeded to dip the birds. The job was
nearly completed when one of the dipped ran
over the lighted candle, caught alight and fled
among the others, who also lit up. It was like
the Battle of Jutland, only quicker. Moral: If you
can't do your job in daylight, keep silkworms.
* * * •
“Quince”: There is a probability of
another imported animal becoming a nuisance in the
vicinity of Adelaide. North American squirrels,
evidently escapees from the adjacent Zoo, are making
themselves at home and rooting things up in the
Botanic Gardens. The director finds these aliens
responsible for the mysterious cutting off of young-
plants. They also got away with the crop of wal-
nuts, and have eaten all the pine seed and acorns.
The little fellows have frugal instincts, and when
food is plentiful store away supplies for the possi-
bility of lean times ahead, but evidently so many
good tilings are available on their hunting-ground
that they have not found it necessary to draw on
the hidden larder. It puzzled the gardeners for some
time to find why dozens of young trees were coming
up in unexpected places in the park. Now they
have the reason—the squirrels planted ’em. If
prompt, measures are not taken for extermination
orchardists are likely to have a tough proposition
with these handsome but rapacious consumers. I
understand they are a curse to American gardeners..
* * * *
“Nor’-West” : The rlottrel and other ground
birds are well camouflaged, but for the championship
I enter the quail. When perfectly still members of
the tribe positively defy detection. Many a time I
have stood over a pointing dog ami tried to detect
the quarry, but never with success. It is only -when
on the move that the bird can be seen. At certain
seasons the striped, or stubble, quail comes in
myriads to the plains of the North-West to feed on
the hard black berries of a little shrub called “fat
hen.” Another very small swift-flying quail is also
fairly numerous. It is chestnut in color, with white
underneath, and has only three toes —a member of
the “turnix” family. After the great drought these
birds swarmed to the North-West in countless num-
bers, and they got up past the Warialda district (as
a rule, they do not get so far east in great numbers).
The bush was fairly alive with them, and they were
shot in thousands for the Sydney markets. Experts
say that they came from China and Japan. Maybe;
but I know that they bred on the plains during their
sta>, and it is remarkable how well their plumage-
markings blend with our own Australian herbage.
“Wangai”: The Government teacher at
Torres Strait has to be something of a liuguist. The
following order for necessaries was handed in a few
days ago: 1 tolan uk, 20 padam, 2 ins manil, 4 henk
twan, 2 botils sklumstar, 1 gibbidy pipe. Transla-
tion: One towline hook, 20 fathoms 2in. Manila rope,
four hanks twine, two bottles Stockholm tar, one
G.B.D. pipe.

0. : Are any Abo. writers acquainted
with the Northern Territory buffalo? I shot one in ’92 at
Cook, on the Diamantina (about lat. 22), and became
curious to know if any have been seen further south.
One was got before that date on Dotswood, near
Townsville, but he was marching east to the sea, like
Shermap. My particular buff, was a very old gentle-
man, who, I suppose, had been handed the key of the
street by the young bulls, and was apparently emulat-
ing Dr. Morrison’s walk from the Gulf to Melbourne.
(I wonder if Morrison ever rehearses, in
his dreams, that great pedestrian stunt, more than
35 years ago.) Sent the head of the old beast to
Brisbane, and I think it still hangs in the office of
the Q.N.B. in Queen-street.

“Melos”: Tell “South C.” (B. 25/7/181
that the Bundabunda snake is found in all parts of
Australia, except Southern Victoria. The color scheme,
alteihate black and white rings, is characteristic of
this species, whilst that of the ringed sea-snake
varies greatly in the distribution of black, brown and
yellow. A smaller relative, abiding 1n AVestralia,
is yellowish below and brown above with two black
patches, one on nape of neck and one on the head.

I was married by Matilda in the not-so-long-ago;
l was not Matilda’s bridegroom, and she wore no
dress of snow,
For Matilda was the pretty Clerk of Petty Session. Oh,
It was splendid being married by Matilda !
\ow the service it was snappy, for she had no time
to spare;
While she tied me to dear Hanna#! was glad we’d
wandered there,
For she quite enjoyed the wedding—though it wasn't
her affair—
She was better than a parson was Matilda!
As a widower of forty T’d faced altar-rails before-
The verger sneered behind the font, the parson
almost swore ;
But Matilda was so joyous that her feet scarce
touched the floor.
I’d have swapped a stout archbishop for Matilda !
So she waltzed us through the wedding, and no dreary
march was played.
We’d have done a whirling tango if a moment more
we’d stayed ;
But she’d other legal business, so her fee we gladly
paid,
And she blessed us with a handshake did Matilda.

BRONCHITIS
= CURE =
IS THE FINEST REMEDY IN THE WORLD FOR
COUGHS, CROUP AND COLDS.
iHOSE who have had occasion to take Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure are
astonished at its Wonderful Healing Power. Sufferers from Bron-
chitis, Cough, Croup, Pain or Soreness in the
Chest, Hoarseness, Difficulty of Breathing, Stuffiness,
Asthma, experience delightful and rapid relief. This
medicine is particularly valuable to those who are sub-
ject to Colds on the Chest, as it Strengthens the Lungs,
and renders them less susceptible. It is most comfort-
ing in allaying Irritation in the Throat, and giving
Strength to the Voice, and for this reason is thoroughly
appreciated by Clergymen, Public Speakers and
Singers. It does not allow a Cough to become
Chronic, and in this respect is absolutely indis-
pensable in preventing a cold from developing
into Bronchitis, Asthma, Pneumonia, Pleurisy,
or Consumption. No house should be with-
out a bottle of this Wonderful Remedy, as
taken at the first indication of a Cold, a
dose or two is generally sufficient. A
Cold should always be “nipped in the
bud,” or serious illness may follow.

bis machinery about with him in his head,
and can put his hat on his factory at any
moment and remove over the border. Here
he differs from even a newspaper man, who
is anchored down by his office, his printing
machinery and the necessity to live so close
to. his readers that he can reach a large
proportion of them before breakfast. So,
provided his Federal Government of lir.ee
Nations supplies a good copyright law,
Freetrade ( i.c .. no duties on books or the
material that books are made with) suits
Mr. Wells admirably. Hut if “The Time
Machine” or “The War of the Worlds” was
a thing that was turned out of equal quality
on a loom by any journeyman in any coun-
try, and Mr. Wells had no chance of a job
except by being as cheap as the rice-eating
novelist in Canton, or the semi-nude
romancer in Java who makes his large family
start romancing also at the age of eight, the
matter might strike him differently.
And he demands that his Federation
should clean and pacify and educate and
uplift such places, as Africa and Mesopo-
tamia, because they are wonderful sources.of
raw material. Never does it strike him
that they have abundance of raw
material to spare only because they
are poor, ignorant and decimated by
war. With plenty of uplift, they will
become bigger producers of raw material for
a while. Then with more uplift they will
become manufacturers and use their own
raw materials. Also they will become far
more populous and more luxurious, and will
eat their own raw materials. The overwhelm-
ing feature of the 19th century—more won-
derful than all its mechanical or literary
triumphs—was the increase of population.
Many countries accumulated four times as
many people in that century as they had
done in all the thousand centuries before.
Many went faster than that. In 1801 every
place in the world, save mere city States like
Hamburg or one-valley States like San
Marinlb, had materials of many sorts to sell,
especially food. Raw materials were a
drug in the market and made people tired.
They almost hated the sight of them. Then
Britain. Franco, Belgium, Germany. Austria
and Italy began to go out of the business and
shout for imports. The F.X.. Canada and
Japan are following suit. They want to
export manufactured goods and secure the.
profits of manufacturing. The opening up of
new raw-material countries is a pleasant and
profitable thing—and dashed temporary.
The book concludes with a rather heavy
yet interesting dissertation upon Democracy.
Possibly Mr. Wells puts a shade too much
stress on Democracy, though that is a mis-
take in the right direction. He says, for
instance, that “the small Greek republics
collapsed through sheer political ineptitude,
before the Macedonians.” Partly they did, for
their fragmentary condition and their bitter
jealousies didn't make for strength in face
of a common danger. Partly they collapsed
because it was the day when the spear was
the queen of weapons, and the Macedonian
spear was ISft. long, which was about Bft.
beyond the average, and there was a man
with a long head behind the long spear.
IChatto and Windus, London.]
Sex Hygiene and Sex Education, by Atkinson and
Dakin (Angus and Robertson, Sydney), mildly states
the case for frankness to the young about matters
on which frankness, no matter what we may say
about the irrationality of secrecy, is more difficult
than anything else in the scheme of life. Generally
—almost invariably—the young get their first glim-
merings of information in a dirty, furtive sort of
way from other kids and depraved adults. A subject
of overwhelming importance to the individual re-
mains during the most plastic years of his life a
matter about which he notices a conspiracy of
evasion in one place and an atmosphere of filthiness
in another. Atkinson (Commissioner of Public
Health in W.A.) and Dakin (Professor of -Biology
at the Uni.' of W.A.) want to end that, and write
suggestively about imparting knowledge decently for
the preservation of health and the protection of
morals. The ideal is easier to state than to reduce
to practical terms, aim it seems that the
authors rather beg the question they raise. They
distrust the class method, yet seem to lean towards
it. Now it is obvious enough that attempts to
teach what the authors are talking about and the
reader is thinking of to school classes (it is no good
side-tracking the thing by introducing terms like
“hygiene” and “ethics,” which, to the juvenile
mind, are more or less incomprehensible) would be
a very terrible business. The results, it is quite
possible to imagine, might be a million times worse
than the results of the prevailing chaos. With lads
and lasses verging on the adult stage it might bo
all right. With little children it might be all
wrong. And it does no harm to remember that
among these the smattering of “knowledge” picked
up at random is not nearly so demoralising as the
shocked adult often supposes. The book is really
an appeal to parents to take a sane view of their
responsibilities and of their children's future, and
to realise that round this matter of sex function
cluster many other issues relating to character and
health. A useful and suggestive little work. The
enlightenment of the adult would most likely carry
with it a solution of the difficulty about the young-
sters.

That gives two views of how things have
gone since capital was written down os. per
share. Formerly, of the paid capital of
£17,500 no less than £15,000 represented
intangible assets —goodwill items represent-
ing the right to conduct business in some-
body else's premises. But as the lease ran
its course no effort was made to provide for
the perishing asset. When the lease ex-
pired for the first time it was renewed
without any bother. Next time, however,
when a renewal was sought the eo. found
itself called upon to spend something like
£lO,OOO on additions and improvements.
At that time visible assets amounted to
under £BOOO. There was a clean-up, capi-
tal was written down, and then a fresh
start was made. Since the war profits
have been affected by lost custom, dearer
supplies and liquor-trading restrictions.
But during the past half-year there has
been a marked improvement, and there has
been an increase of £425 in the gross profit,
on trading compared with the same term last
year. No doubt some of this improvement
is due to the big bar trade which has come
to this well-situated pub. As will be seen
from the first table, after having paid divi-
dends averaging slightly over 10 p.c. p.a.
the co. has been able to accumulate a little
towards the return of capital when the
prfesent lease expires in 12 years’ time.
Progress is not rapid though : in 61 years
£2414 has been piled up.-* Capital is now
£12,250, in 35,000 shares paid to 7s.
“G.” : A N. S. Wales bismuth show that is
likely to be heard of in the future is that held
by Alexander Biddell and Son at Duekmaloi,
in the Oberon district. The formation is
unusual, and. for the central tablelands,
unique, consisting of a big contact deposit
with the bismuth impregnating the stone
throughput. Kiddel is treating the stuff by
hand, and gets through 24 to 25 tons a
week, with the bismuth recovery at the rate
of 1 p.c. and a concentrate of between 50
and 60 p.c. The extent of the deposit has
not been definitely fixed, but it is claimed
that there is enough stone available to keep
a big battery going for years. Nothing
beyond picking is necessary to displace the
stone, which is almost on the surface. The
primitive jigger-box system of concentration
is being followed pending something
systematic. The Riddels hold 20 acres
under lease, and a Bathurst crowd have the
show under option, due to expire in a few
weeks, on the basis of £6OO for a two-thirds
right, the present lessees retaining the
other third. Minister Ball, who recently
had a look at the deposit, has recommended
the despatch of a Government geologist to
the field. The show was worked years ago,
but little was known about pro-
cesses.

“D.” : Why is not some attempt made in
Australia to rid the mining industry of the
worthless or undesirable director? In
America the mining director is a business
man, sometimes a mining specialist, but
always an executive head. In Australia the
director is often a dummy with no business
or mining experience, and often share-
brokers or speculators get on Boards merely in
their own interests to secure first-hand infor-
mation as to what is going on at the mine,
and do not care a jot for shareholders’ inter-
ests. As a result, of all this, mines are fre-
quently floated on reports containing exag-
gerated statements of ore values and possibili-
ties, or the poor suffering public is let into
things which require several thousands of
pounds to open up and which have not
sufficient capital to sink a shaft, let alone
develop and equip. They all come to grief
sooner or later, and when they do share-
holders mournfully brood over their losses
and the papers devote a few lines to what
is termed tne glorious uncertainty of min-
ing!
•'Bluebeard'’: E. B. Osborn gives a
thoughtful appreciation of Leon Gellert.’s
Songs of a Campaign in one of the
English weeklies. He mentions .the trio
of soldier poets —Rupert Brooke for Eng-
land. Alan Seeger for America, and Leon
Gellert for Australia, and that the resem-
blance is manifold between the trio. All
three were young, all-questioning, loathed the
war, yet saw that they must sacrifice all that
they had been and might be. Gellert, like
Alan Seeger. is steeped in sub-tropical sun-
shine, and there is no trace of the cold and
calculating self-critical spirit of the North.
Sayk Osborne: “The bleak Australian
commonsense, which is not to be distracted
from the ultimate issue by pomp of circum-
stance (battle honors or the clang of trum-
pets, patriotic songs or what not) comes out
in many of his poems. Yes, these Songs of
a Campaign will not be forgotten, for they
mirror the mood of Australia’s self-sacrifice
and have now the grave and time-defying
beauty of memorial.”
QUEENSLAND NATIONAL BANK.
HALF-YEARLY MEETING.
The ninety-first ordinary general meeting of the
proprietors of the Queensland National Bank, Limited,
was held at the Banking House, Queen-street, Bris-
bane, on August 15. The chairman of directors
(Mr. Geo. Edw. Bunning) presided, and there were
also present Hon. G. W. Gray, M.L.C. ; Messrs. James
Milne, James Love, W. H. Hart (directors), Mr. W. Y.
Ralston (general manager) and a number of share-
holders.
The report and balance-sheet for the half-year ended
June 30 was taken as read.
The Chairman, in moving the adoption of the
report and balance-sheet, said:—
Gentlemen,—l have much pleasure in submitting
for your approval the report and balance-sheet for
the half-year ended June 30 last, and as printed
copies have been in your hands for several weeks I
shall ask you to take the same as read.
You will observe that the net profit for the six
months amounts to £53,0/0 3s. 3d., which has been
dealt with as follows: ‘‘Private depositors’ repayment
fund ” £51,500 los. /d., and balance can led for-
ward in “profit and loss account, £1504 Bs. Id., and
I am ve#V pleased to announce that the final payment,
equal to 4d. in the £ on the face value ot the stock,
was distributed to our shareholders on the 12th inst.,
thus completing the conditions ot oor scheme ot
arrangement so Ist contemn the agreement with
the Government and our depositors, and consequently
the profits, for the current half-year will be available
for the payment of dividends to the shareholders,
After full consideration the directors have decided to
pay interim dividends for quarters ended September
30 to March 31; and, in order to make the time
between payments as equal as possible, the interim
dividends for quarters ended September 30 and March
31 will be paid about the middle of November and
May in each year. It is with great pleasure I have
to announce that the first interim dividend for the
quarter ending’ September 30 next will be payable on
the following November 11; and the .final dividends
for each half-year will, of course, be declared at our
general meetings, which are held in February and
August. The directors have further decided that the
interim dividend to be paid on November 14 will be
21 per cent, for the quarter ending September 30.
being at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum.
It is a great relief to the management to be finally
freed from the heavy yearly payments we were called
upon to make to our stockholders, and 1 congratulate
the shareholders after so many years' waiting that
they will from now receive a fair return on their
capital. \
The business of the bank continues very sound, and
our position generally is an undoubtedly strong one,
as. excluding capital accounts and interminable in-
scribed deposit stock, our liquid assets, which amount
to £5,724,628 9s. 8d„ are equal to 01.13 per cent,
of the whole of our liabilities to the Government and
the public. Our depositors’ position (both current
accounts and fixed deposits) is unique in its security,
as they are specially protected for all time under
clause 9 of our schepie of arrangement, which pro-
vides that, after the Government, they are a first
charge on the whole of the assets of the bank, which
on June 30 last, as you will see by a reference to the
balance-sheet, were £12,935,440 4s. Id.
In view of the large amounts required s>y the Com-
monwealth Government for war purposes by way of
loans, in the flotation of which the banks assiM very
largely, we in common with other similar institutions
are checking advances for speculative purposes as
much as possible,' and we would impress upon onr
clients, in view of the fact that they will be expected
by the Federal Government to contribute to the fullest
of their ability to future loans, that they should cur-
tail their requirements as much as possible consist-
ently with the proper conduct of their respective
businesses. It is also advisable to note that the
Federal Government is likely to be compelled to
impose much heavier taxation for war purposes tit, an
early date, and it is necessary to be prepared to meet
it.
Since our last half-yearly meeting eight of onr
staff have enlisted, and we much regret that since
that date we have received advices that six of our
staff have been wounded and that five have been killed
in. action, to the relatives of whom our most sincere
sympathy is extended. •
The directors -extend tlieir congratulations to Mi.
Ralston and the bank upon the attainment of the
objects for which he, with wise prevision, many years
since framed the final scheme of arrangement ratified
in 1897. The purposes he sought are now completed,
and at a period sonic few years prior to the date
anticipated when his proposals were adopted. It
been a fine achievement, entailing responsibility,
arduous work and careful forethought; and the results
have had momentous influence towards the prosperity
of the State, equally with the other interests directly
associated with this institution, and its stability has
afforded valuable support to the various industries
upon which the welfare of the community, is depend-
ent. These congratulations are also extended to the
staff and all who have assisted in securing the splen-
did result which places the bank amongst the leading
and soundest financial institutions in the Commonwealth.
Mr. G, W. Gray, M.L.C., in seconding the motion,
said: The report and balance-sheet is the most satis-
factory and comprehensive in the history of the
bank, and as an old shareholder and a very old cus-
tomer of the bank I endorse all that has been said
in the chairman’s speech relative to the general mana-
ger—Mr. Ralston —and we all owe him a debt of
/gratitude for the skilful way he has handled the
affairs of the institution, overcoming all difficult
financial problems during the past 21 years. He has
proved a strong man and a very able banker, whose
services, I trust, we may be able to retain for many
years to come.
Mr. John White also congratulated the general
manager and the management on the splendid achieve-
ment, and the motion was then carried unanimously.
Mr. J. W. Wassell proposed a hearty vote of thanks
to the directors, general manager and officers of the
bank, which was seconded by Mr. Win. McGregor and
carried by acclamation.
The Chairman acknowledged the compliment on
behalf of the directors, and the general manager, in
responding, said:—
Gentlemen, —I have to thank you exceedingly for
your kind vote of thanks to the staff and myself,
which, on this occasion, is particularly acceptable,
and I heartily congratulate the shareholders on tlieii
position as disclosed by the balance-sheet and the
Chairman’s speech.
I may mention that since our reconstruction the
bank, by the formation of companies, has made liquid
several large old assets which it was impossible to
dispose of or deal with as a whole. 1 refer more
particularly to the Millaquin Sugar Company, Limited,
with a paid-up capital of £500,000, and the Queens-
land National Pastoral Company, Limited, with a
paid-up capital of £850,000. We have disposed oi
numerous shares in these companies at from par to a
substantial premium, the proceeds of which hare
assisted us greatly in extending our business and m
strengthening the bank, and these companies are no«
regarded by the investing public as sound commercial
concerns, and the shares are well quoted.
I consider the shareholders and stockholders have
been particularly fortunate in their choice of direc-
tors from time to time during the whole of the teim
I have been connected with the management. No
body of men from first to last could have given more
thought and devotion to their duties than those
chosen, and the policy of the bank under their direc-
tion has always been sound and sensible.
It will give you some idea of what we had to face
at the time our scheme of arrangement came into
force when I remind you that before we could put you
in the happy position you are in to-day we had to
make good to the Government, the stockholders am
private ledger accounts over £3,500.000. The hea"
calls on our resources from time to time for thiV
purpose are now things of the past, and the bank i?
undoubtedly at this date one of the soundest financial
institutions in Australia.
In conclusion, I desire to thank the directors, oi
the consideration they have always shown to me, am
for the confidence they have always placed in me. >»
this connection I desire specially to mention II >
James Milne, who has been a member of the Board
either here or in London almost continuously from
the commencement until now. I sincerely thank tu
members of the staff for their loyalty and assistance
extending over so many veal's, and I am glad to say
that it is the intention of the directors to give piam
tical proof of their appreciation of the staff during
the current half-year, either by way of a.bonus on
salaries or a donation to their provident func , an
last, but not least, gentlemen, 1 have to thank you
for your continued courtesy and many 0
kindly feeling towards the staff and myself on vfrr
many occasions.

Mary is married
Jacks' at the front
A ND the many happy evenings you used to
spend en Jamille are gone—never to return.
Even when Jack’s booming baritone once more
fills the house —he will miss Mary’s accompani-
ments. You know he never could get past ragtime.
In the meantime you and mother
are dreading the silent evenings of
the coming months. They stretch
ahead in a seeming eternity of
ennui! You have both so long de-
pended on the “youngsters” for
amusement that any talent you once
possessed yourselveshas rusted away
into uselessness. But there is a
way the Beale Player way—to
realise all the enjoyment that you
think you are going to miss. The
“Beale” Player-Piano has every
attribute of the straight Beale-Piano
—including the steel tuning system
—together with a Player mechanism
of faultless technique. It also
excels in tone control. Thus it
enables anyone musically inclined
to give full rein to their rpusical
thoughts. On the “Beale,” one
plays almost instinctively—the
mechanism is so sensitive and
instantly responsive to the delicate
controlling devices. Informal
concerts held daily.
Call and ask to hear a favourite composition
played the Beale-Plaver way . It will open
up a wonderful field of enjoyment for you.

IMPORTANT.—LOOK TO YOUR TEETH.
There are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, comfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural scz.
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifically prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

fine numbers for dancing. The vocal items likely to
become firm favorites include "America, Here’s My Boy,
by George Wilton Ballard and chorus; “Road that Leads

IF STOMACH HURTS TRY THIS.
If you suffer from dyspepsia, indigestion,
pain after eating, gastritis, heartburn or
stomach trouble due to acidity or food fer-
mentation—and over ninety per cent, of
stomach complaints are due to these causes
—go to your chemist and get a bottle of
Bisurated Magnesia. The next time you
eat or have pain in the stomach take half a
teaspoonful in a little hot water and note
how quickly all pain and discomfort ceases.
It is said that thousands of soldiers use
this simple remedy at the Front, and many
attribute their freedom from all digestive
troubles, in spite of exposure, hasty eating
and poorly-cooked food, to its regular use.
Chemists say that its almost invariable suc-
cess is due to the fact that Bisurated Mag-
nesia quickly neutralises the excess and
stops fermentation, thus promoting healthy
natural digestion. Being absolutely harm-
less as well as inexpensive, this simple
remedy should be kept on hand in every
home where economy and good health are
sought.— Advt.

face to the road, thereby saving friction.
(2) TREAD.—A great thickness of rubber, which
is practically cut- and chip-proof.
(3) BREAKER STRIP, which, being made of
loosely-woven, heavy fabric, binds the tread
to the carcase of the tyre.
(4) PURE RUBBER.—Pure Rubber is placed

(5) CARCASE.—Composed of five plies of heavy,
long-fibre canvas, heavily impregnated with
rubber.
(6) PULL AIE SPACE. '
(7) SIDE WALLS. —Realising the severe work
tyres are called upon to do in the country,
we have placed a great thickness of rubber on
the side walls, preventing water from entering,
as often happens in other makes of tyres after
a few months'’ service. Other makes have
very little thickness of rubber at this point.
(8) BEADS are heavily reinforced and skin-

Kyrle Bellew used to claim that he held a
record. He had, lie said, made a date with
more fair admirers at one moment than any
attractive actor of his day and generation.
A letter came to him while he was at the
Melb. Princess’s with Mrs. Brown-
Potter, signed “Gwen,” telling him of
the unbounded admiration Gwen had for
him, and beseeching him, if he had any sym-
pathy for the tender regard of pure young
maidenhood, to be on a particular seat in
the Botanical Gardens at a specified hour on
a day mentioned. Impelled by curiosity,
Bellew attended, and presently a procession
of college girls, extending for quite a
HE OUGHT TO KNOW.
HE : “I can’t understand how it is people
keep on coming to this sort of show.
If you’ve seen one you’ve seen them
all.”
SHE : "Oh, hut some of them are different.”
H E: “No. I assure you; and I’ve seen every
one for the last fifteen years.”
hundred yards, two deep, began to file past,
and all cast adoring eyes on “Curly.” An
impulse fired Bellew to stop one maiden
under the nose of an indignant teacher.
“Which of you is Gwen, my dear?” lie said.
Tlie girl giggled. “We’re from the Lady
Gwendolin College.” she said. “We are all
Gwens.” Then Bellew understood. He had
an appointment with a whole school.
“Fax" : The incident of the double-knock in
the third act of “The Thirteenth Chair”
seems to have been suggested by the wireless
telegraph surprise in Justin McCarthy’s com-
edy, “The Dictator.” Old Rosalie Le Grange
addresses a question to space, and gets what
she takes to be a supernatural response. Two
knocks, sounding exactly like those she is in
the habit of producing with her foot, are
heard as though in response to her appeal to
the spirit of “Laughing Eyes.” The old girl
is astonished at her success. “I didn’t do
that;’ she mutters. In “The Dictator” the
hero has instructed his valet to keep a tele-
graph apparatus clicking in the adjoining
room, in order to gull a Mexican-Spaniard
swanker who is threatening to have him
“chotted.” The clicking is supposed to be a
message in response to a “wireless” which
the threatened Yank has addressed to the
U.S. Government. The swarthy revolution-
ist is half convinced by it. He goes away for
a while, promising to return later and have
the New Yorker shotted unless he can ex-
plain his arrival in the country. After his
departure the clicking occurs again, where-
upon the worried Yank calls to his valet to
stop working the “wireless” swindle now
there is nobody present to be deceived by it.
protests that he isn’t accountable for
the clicks. Hero rushes into next room and
discovers that the messages which he scat-
teied abroad, without any hope of fetching
a reply, have really been intercepted by a
L.b. warship. “We’ve got a bite!” he
cries. If “The Thirteenth Chair” were a
farcical comedy instead of a melodrama the
fraudulent old medium would cry “Got a
bite!” when she hears the butler’s two
knocks at the door.
“M.P.A.”: A glaring instance of the
stmking-fish tendency in Australian picture
circles is the latest move by a party of show-
men to send Marcus Clarke’s story, “For
the Term of His Natural Life,” to U.S. to
be produced as a movie drama. George
Smith, a well-known Melbourne showman,
who hails from Britain, has, it appears,
secured the rights for production. Of late
wo have seen what Australians can do on
the screen in “The Woman Suffers,” a real
Australian story photographed splendidly
by one of the Higgins brothers, and pro-
claimed by the trade as first-class work.
There is no reason whatever for Clarke’s
tale to be put before the camera outside the
land of its birth, and a bunch with such
sentiments deserve to get it where it’ll do
them the most good, when the nhoto-drama
comes to light, from every man in the busi-
ness who claims to be real Australian.
. There’s an artistic restraint about the
picture-show advts. that is a pleasure in
itself. Take a few of the well-chosen
words concerning “The Kaiser, the Beast
of Berlin.” They promise an intellectual
evening’s entertainment. “You shall fol-
low every one of the mad dog’s unspeakable
abominations, and when his black course
has been arrested you will see if the picture
doesn’t give this lust-maddened wolf-hound
of Potsdam his just deserts. See the inside
life of this cancerous, degenerate viper. See
the Beast of Berlin sent mad with a refer-
ence to his Withered Soul.” That’s the
strong point of these publicity agents—they
never overdo things.
“8.J.”: “Business Before Pleasure” is
not, as has been suggested, the first plav
seen in Australia in which the biograph has
furnished first aid to the dramatist. The
earlier stages of the race between the motor-
car and the train in “The Whip” was
shown on the screen, and brought to an
unconvincing finish on the stage, in the
midst of swaying canvas and pink flares.
“0.K.”: The tradition of the altitude of
the original Chang, the Chinese Giant,
has been clouded by recent obituary notices
of a “Chang” who was born in Scotland, and
“had all the appearance of a native of the
Celestial Empire.” He is spoken of as
“Chang” Hay, and was called “the Chinese
Giant” on the strength of a mere 7ft. in
height. Seven feet! Chang, the Chinese,
was fully Oft. high and fairly well-propor-
tioned at that. Sergeant Bates, the Ameri-
can giant, who was boomed later, was some
inches shorter. Bates married Anna Swan,
an American giantess, and they parented at
least one phenomenally large' infant; but
Chang died a bachelor, as far as I remember.
He was a cultured man in manner and
speech, and the money he earned as a giant
was not his only means of living. London
sassiety had ,some good stories of him. A
well-known politician one day took the giant
to his club, and, after lunch, proposed a
stroll down Piccadilly. The sight of the
human steeple drew a crowd, and the dis-
concerted host hailed a hansoln cab, remark-
ing that they could continue their talk in com-
fort. “If the roof were taken off the cab,”
said the courteous Chinaman.
From New York :
Margaret Anglin is the most effulgent of the fixed
stars in the U.S., and her recent interpretation of
the Medea at the Carnegie > Hall, New. York, was
applauded by'the best critics. Young Lionel Atwill,
one of the Firm’s imports for “The Whip” in Aus-
tralia, has moved up into the society of Alla
Nazimova, in a series of Ibsen roles. Australian
actor Cyril Keightley, commended for a nice portrait
in It. C.. Carton’s comedy, “Off Chance,” at the
New York Empire, did Cassius to Tyrone Power’s
Brutus in a production of “Julius Caesar” in another
Broadway Theatre. Laurette Taylor, the original
“Peg o’ My Heart,” Julieted with-a Romeo of her
own choosing at the Shakespeare Playhouse, New
York, and later played Portia, assisted by Australian
0. P. Heggie as Shylock. Laurette’s hubby, Hartley
Manners, conceived the bright idea of staging his
failure, “Out There,” for the benefit of the Red
Cross, and with the help of an all-star cast, including
G. M. Cohan, George Arliss and Arnold Daly, raised
683,000 dollars in a few weeks. Hilda Spong,
who lately found some Shaw parts suitable to her
maturity, seemed to be scarcely trying in “The
Fountain of Youth” at the Henry Miller Theatre,
N’York. Pretty Charlotte Ives, who never reached
a top place in the estimation of Australians, is well
established as the heroine in “The Man Who Stayed
Ac Home,” at the 48th-street Theatre.
Beatrice Miranda has been reaping fresh
laurels at the Shaftesbury Theatre, London,
with the Carl Rosa Opera Co. In a new
opera, of British origin, “Dante and Bea-
trice,” written by W. J. Miller and composed
by Stephen Philpot, the Australian singer
has been welcomed with enthusiasm. The
opera is in the style of Balfe and Wallace.
“E. 8.”: Years ago, when Bland Idolt was
playing a season at Melbourne Royal, two
stagehands who had the ticket-marking craze
used to steal out during a long act and have

Pleasure, ” at Sydney
Criterion.

half an hour or so

One night the
police raided the
fan-tannery, and
the brace of stage-
hands, whose job,
amongst other tedi-
ous engagements
was to attend to
the “fag,” were
duly pinched. At
the conclusion of
Act 2 of the
dram a, H o 1 1,
Baker and co. were

horse and the
orchestra lingered
strongly on the
fiii il chord await-
ing the curtain.
The lime man at
last dropped it. As
Bland was leaving
the theatre he met
a constable, who
told him what had
become of the miss-
ing links. Holt laughed like a good sport
and adjourned forthwith to the lockup to
arrange bail.
“Stargazer”: Somebody says “The orches-
tra never revolts.” Wrong again. The
orchestra is long suffering, it is true, its
forbearance is at times miraculous, but
occasionally even the fiddler turns. Our
friend Graff was an Austrian and as decent
a little dirty man as ever breathed. Being
down to it on one occasion, he took service
in the orchestra at the then Opera House,
Melb., while a prowling dramatic company
was indulging itself in a grand metropolitan
season. “The Specked Earl” proved a suc-
cess, to everybody’s great amazement, and
played on and on, week after week, till its
“demnition” insistent drivel got on the nerves
of poor Graff, and one night, when the
specked earl had decoyed the virtuous village
maiden for the 52nd time, that sensitive soul
arose in his place in the small orchestra,
whacked his fiddle on the floor and cried
aloud : “Mein Gott! Mein Gott! I am seek
of dis.” Sudden uproar. The actor-manager
stepped out of his heroic part for a moment
and glared down at Graff: “Plow dare you,
sir?” he said. “I am seek, seek, seek of der
tarn rubbitch dot you talk out,” the musician
replied. “Why you d—d, dirty, little fiddler,
I’ll pull your nose!” gasped the hero. “Dot
iss all ride,” said Graff. “You can pool my
nose, maybe, bud you do not addle my prain
some more. ' And Graff snatched up his
fiddle and pounded out. tearing a few mili-
tant bars from the Soldiers’ Chorus from
"I aust' out of his damaged instrument. An
usher booted him as he passed. The play
was resumed, but ten minutes later an

eldritch shriek from a violin in the gallery
stopped proceedings. Again Graff was booted
out; but: in the middle of Act 3 from the
back stalls Graff’s fiddle screamed another
section of the Soldiers’ Chorus, horribly
out of tune, and for the third time the rabid
little fiddler was ejected. In our bachelor
abode he explained: “I will down sit no more
for free week, but revenge iss a seat.”
“Peter”: Supplementing “Adam’s” par.
(B. J.5/8/T8) let me state that Mary Pick-
ford was a comparatively prominent star
under her correct name of Dolly Nicholson
for the Vitagraph Co. and other movie firms.
Ten or more years back the name of Dolly
Nicholson was almost as potent with the
picture public as her present alias, and 1 can
well recall the rapture with which West’s
first audiences at the old Olympia in Mel-
bourne used to greet the beguiling little
figure with the Smile of roses. The name
of Mary Pickford was adopted when she
bounded on to the regular stage in America
and clung to her when she left to play under
the Biograph.
Dot Boucicault has decided not to renew
his tenancy of Wyndham’s new theatre in
St. Martin-lane. He will take a rest for a
season. About Christmas time he hopes
to produce a new play which Pinero is writ-
ing for his wife, Irene Vanbrugh. Mean-
while he will fill in time by appearing in a
series of one-acters at the Coliseum and other
variety establishments on the circuit con-
trolled by old Melbournian Oswald Stoll.

You were the smartest thing, my dear.
The town you gathered in.
The smallest kinklet in your ear,
The little ringlets that fell clear
From temple white to chin —■
I mind them all as if it were
But yesterday you made a stir.
You came on'tripping to the lights,
A thing of eerie grace,
In (aren’t they’?) white cotton tights,
And crinkled trunks. Your vocal flights
AwOke the placid place.
Besides those tights you wore, ah me 1
Elastic-sided boots, maybe.
And on your head, sweet, as you skipped
A hat (with feathers too),
Yet, fair Priscilla, you unshipped
A ton of hearts, and rich men dipped
Their chimney-pots to you.
And here’s your picture at the show
Good eight-and-forty years ago,
Side on to give your dimple deep,
One hand an elbow holds,
One foot upon its toe you keep,
There’s swansdown on your smock. I weep
At what my eye beholds.
Here on the card as time has flown,
Ah, what a hopeless fright you’ve grown!
VICTORIA.

The Car of Quality.
Out o’Doors
Ride the road of the great Outdoors!
Be healthier, happier—drive an Overland.
A model of your very heart’s desire is included in the complete range of
Overland motor cars. There is a car that will make you proud yet will meet
your purse.
For you cannot find greater value. The huge production of Overlands
makes possible vast economies, and unusual benefits to you.
Look at an Overland a glance will convince you of its
excess value. Ask for the “85 Four” model, for example (see
illustration). There is nothing in the world like it for all-’round
utility. Big four-inch tyres, great reserve engine power, fine
appearance; simple control, comfortable, long lasting. And it is
completely equipped ready for the road.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Make her bed of the mosses green.
This is where she must lie,
With the broad leaf shadow and green leaf sheen
Between her face and the sky ;
And a bird will sing at even and morn
When little brown dusks and stars are born.
Come, soft sleep, on a merry wind,
Ruffle the branches light,
Bring the dreams that the elfmen bind
With flowing ribbons of night,
The dear white dreams that go two-and-two
Through the happy meadows of I-love-you.
Kings go forth with a sword of fire
That queens may weep alone;
And the great of the earth must kiss desire
In a darksome house of stone.
But the old, wise stars in the roof above
Shine all the night in the House of Love.
King am I of the wide free air,
Queen is she of my heart.
The bushes bow to a royal pair
As we toss the green apart;
And all the world love-homage pays
In notes of gold on the grassy ways.
Jewel-box of the shining night,
Opened with crystal keys—
Here’s choice of gems for each bridal night
To wear on the veil of the breeze;
And the great white day has a wedding song
In the high cathedral of Think-no-Wrong.
Lift of the wind, lisp of the tree —
Heart of my heart, sleep well!
There shall be sweets for the honey-bee
In star and cup and bell;
And a bird will sing....Ob, swift love, fly
For the first fine look of her morning eye.
N.S.W.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
It is an irrelevant sort of fact that it was
a Boer general, probably De la Rey, he
being the man on the spot, who indirectly
invented the idea of the tank that Hies low.
The matter w r as known before in a general
way, but he reduced it to a science. He
decided that, in a war of few men and large
spaces and swift movements —a war princi-
pally of rifles, because the heavy guns
couldn’t be shifted fast enough—-the defence
of hill positions was a fool thing. It was
good enough in the days of slow-firing mus-
kets, and it had its advantages for mounted
infantry men with bayonets (only,the Boers
didn’t carry bayonets, which was fatal to
them in the end), but with quick-firing rifles
it was a waste of chances. The downward
shot hit one man in the head or else missed
him. The horizontal shot went through two
or three men at times, and generally hit some-
body. So after losing two or three liill-
defence battles De la Rey and Cronje, at
Modder River, made use of a watercourse
meandering over a dead level plain, where
there was no place for a Boer to run to if he
was hunted out. There they shot horizontally.
They raised hell, which was the only elevated
spot in their position. Similarly the high-
flying airship drops something on the head of
the enemy or else misses him. It is splendid
for attacking buildings, but when it is a
question of breaking up a marching column
the low-flier, which can almost rake it from
end to end, is the real terror. It is Modder
River on a far bigger scale, and with a mov-
able Boer instead of a fixed Boer. Another
point is that certain of the swift entrench-
ment devices used in this war are of U.S.
origin. At least they were a Roman dodge,
but the Americans revived and improved
them. When the .men of Grant or Meade or
Lee were feeling their way on rather open
ground towards a concealed or suspected or
strongly-posted enemy, and a halt seemed
advisable, they dug themselves in with the
velocity of some burrowing animal that puts
its nose to the ground and works its feet like
a whirlwind and is swallowed up. As another
side-issue, either Foch or Haig, whoever was
responsible, should be remembered as the
first general who opened the battle with a
concerted charge of tanks. The new tank is
small and swift, and comparatively cheap
and easy to build, consequently it is numer-
ous. So instead of being a rare and lone-
some fortress walking like the Tower of
London, it has become light cavalry or light
tankarray. The charge of 600 tanks with
the infantry running behind and to some
extent protected from rifle-fire lends a sport-
ive and frisky aspect to war. The Mel-
bourne Cup is a drab old tea-meeting by
comparison.
“Good Australian” :
Have just done the cross-country trip to Perth by
the transcontinental railway. Barring the three
changes between Melbourne and Perth it is quite a
comfortable railway journey, and compares favorably
with all the other long-rail journeys that I have
made in foreign countries. The coaches are excel-
lent, the food good, the service satisfactory and the
road-bed smooth. It was a “dry” train—with plenty
of free grog- in every cabin. It beats all the long
overland railway trips in Canada and America,
because the corridor sleeping-cars are so infinitely
superior to the Pullmans in universal use in North
America. The American sleeping-car is a travelling
indecency; the Australian sleeper is a model of
privacy. As to the scenery, well, there isn’t any
after the Adelaide hills are traversed. One stretch
of 500 miles of a straight line across the Nullabor
(meaning no-tree) Plains without a culvert or bridge
is unparalleled.
The cane-cutters of some North Queens-
land districts are on strike for a modified
form of piece-work. They ask a minimum
of 255. per day—the man who earns less
than that amount to get that amount, and
the man who earns more to get more. At
Ingham the strikers stopped a train in the
street, uncoupled the engine, and told the
driver to eat his hat, or words to that effect.
It sounds very dreadful, but it isn’t quite
like stopping the Adelaide express that is
eating up time and space on a sft. 3in.
track and carrying the world’s mails.
Queensland possesses about three dozen rail-
ways (886 miles in all) of the 2ft.-gauge,
and the trains amble through streets quite
affably, and stop to speak to passing friends.
There are about as many types of carriage
as there are carriages—some of them in-
vented by a carpenter and some by a
plumber, and some apparently by a prophet.
Nobody Regards interference with that kind
of train very seriously, so long as no damage
is done and the language isn’t too dreadful.


On every outing
KODAK
Add to the pleasure of the trip itself
by taking pictures of the places and
the people that interest you —then you
will have the after pleasure that comes
from possessing the pictures them-
selves.
Anybody can take and finish pictures by the Kodak
system and do it well. Because simpler to
handle, Kodak films give better results than glass
plates. You need no dark-room for loading the
camera or for unloading. Bven the developing is
done without a dark-room, and print-making is
easy (again no dark-room) with Velox or Nepera
paper. If you don’t care to do your own develop-
ing and printing, Kodak film, being light and un-
breakable, may be readily mailed to your dealer
for finishing.
Kodak means photography with the bother left out.
It offers the simple, easy way to good pictures —
and is less expensive than you think.
The Vest Pocket Autographic Kodak
—“The Soldier’s Kodak” —makes
pictures 2f xlf inches. You can then
enlarge the negatives up to any reason-
able size desired. Price, 37/6. Others
up to £l5/2/ =

BOSTOCK’S—THE ECONOMY SHOE POLISH
We wish to stress the fact that ECONOMY is one of the chief attributes of
Bostock Shoe Dressings. It is economical by virtue of the fact that it is more
than a mere polish.
Containing, as it does, ingredients which nourish and preserve the leather, it gives
longer life to footwear.
With the cost of shoes mounting
higher and higher, the daily use
of Bostock’s, with its leather-
preserving qualities, is particu-
larly desirable.

“Rosna” (London) : The London Institute
of Journalists is taking a leaf out of the book of
the A.J.A., and has evolved a scheme to im-
prove scribes’ prospects on the lines of the
Australian award. As there’s no chance of
getting a minimum wage fixed by law yet
awhile, the Institute has hit upon a neat
plan of classifying all papers according to
the minimum salaries paid by them to every
qualified journalist on their staffs. In Class
A the minimum is six guineas; B, five
guineas: C, four guineas; D, three ; E, two
and a half. Each paper i§ politely in-
vited by the Institute to inform that body
as to which class it belongs, and since each
one is likely for business reasons to wish to
grade itself as high as possible the plan
should make for better “screws” all round.
The classified lists will be published by the
Institute; also an unclassified list of those
rags which haughtily refuse to divulge what
they pay their minions. Cadets of less than
three years’ experience may be employed in
due proportion (about one to five qualified
members of the staff) at a minimum salary
of one guinea for the first year, one and a
half the second, and two the third. A 46-
hour week is also demanded, and three weeks
annual holiday on full pay. Women scribes
are being included in the scheme equally
with their brethren.

“Arthur R.”: Hayseed was reading the
meteorological notes posted at the G.P.O.
He waded through them until he reached the
notice, “For particulars of rainfall see
bulletin.” “ ’Strath, that’s hard,” he mut-
tered ; “see bulletin, and I’ve just bought the
blanky Herald.”
* * * *
“Trion”: The recent agreement between
the A.J.A. and country newspaper proprie-
tors in Bananaland is easier worked on paper
than in practice. The proprietors find it
hard to knuckle down to the 46-hour-week
and the' time-book, while the clause in the
agreement providing one clear day off per
week for all journalists has them fairly up
a tree. The two Maryborough dailies solved
the latter problem by refusing to attend any
Saturday functions. This shut-down scheme
is working well —in the meantime.
* * * *
“Hargo”: “Musketoon” (B. 18/7/T8)
wants to know of a more versatile news-
paper man than Woodlands, of Canowindra
Star. Let me introduce Andrew Wilson
Cross, who founded the Daylesford (Vic.)
Herald 35 years ago. I was his first appren-
tice. His sheet was tri-weekly, and he did
his share of the reporting, paragraphing,
article-writing and proof-reading. Columns
of matter came from his “stick” without a
line of copy. On “dis” days he would take a
turn at jobbing or working anything up to a
five-color job. For years he did the Lynch
Family of Bellringers’ work, cutting and de-
signing his own blocks. An electric-bell system
of communication was installed throughout
the office by him, and afterwards came elec-
tric-light, which he extended to business
places, churches, etc. He made a small
engine for driving his lighter machines when
there was no use for the bigger power ; also
he constructed a motor-car. xY bit of special
ruling didn’t pull him up, and when he in-
stalled the monoline he mastered that. Num-
bering appliances on his machines were
adopted from clocks, as also was a distance-
recorder on the bike which he used for
pushing outside business and collecting.
Andrew deserted the Inky Way to join an
auctioneering firm, so his end was peace.
Marvellous how these old lies persist.
Thus E. I->. Osborn, in the Illustrated
London News (13/4/’18), on the verse
of Leon Gellert: “The savage splendor
of poppies in the corn is discerned through a
periscope.... They are nodding symbols of
the sultry magnificence of Australian scenery
with its songless birds and glowing scentless
flowers .” Of_course, we all know where E. B.
Osborn got it from. He wasn’t relying on
his own ear and nose, but on the nose and
oar of an early immigrant who was too home-
sick to observe accurately. Any ancient
blither lasts these plodding bookmen a long
time.

From London:—
A couple of veteran English editors were added to
the roll of knig'hts at the beginning of June. .John
Merry le Sage, the “G.O.M. of Fleet-street,” con-
tinues in harness at 81. His briskness, vivacity and
engaging- juvenility of manner and aspect are excel-
lent advertisements for the healthiness and virility
of journalism as a profession. Previously general
manager, he has since the death of Edwin Arnold,
supervised the editorial department of the Daily
Telegraph as well, and is now styled managing-
editor. He spends the whole day in office, but
leaves the night work to the long-experienced sub-
editor. Le Sage started on the paper as a reporter
60 years ago, was soon promoted special correspon-
dent and did tours through France, Germany, Italy,
Russia, America and elsewhere. He did good work
in the Franeo-Prussian scrap of 1870, and was shut
up in Paris during the Commune. The other new
journalistic knight, A. S. Jeans, has been for half a
century located in Liverpool, where he edits a couple
of combined morning papers merged into one, under
the style and title of the Post and Mercury. He is
the son of a Scottish editor, and has mounted up-
wards from the junior-reporter rung.
In the second issue of the “Handbook of
the Commonwealth Parliament” the figures
incidental to elections in all constituencies
since Federation are brought up to date, and
details given of the voting at the various
referenda. This makes it a useful document.
Reproductions in half-tone of past and pre-
sent members of the Federal Legislature,
vvith short political biographies, make it
picturesque. Anyone who wants to know
what G. Reid or Tom Playford or anyone
looked like in the long ago can get the
facts in an instant, and incidentally become
acquainted with the Moloneys and Hughes
and Bruce Smith and Frank Anstey and
multitudinous other persons. Whether it
was worth using up a lot of expensive paper
on this job just now is another matter. The
printing is done excellently anyway. ,

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, August 20, 1918.
My Dear Arini, —
The late M. Albert Metin, of the French
Commercial Mission, was in Australia, it
seems, about 25 years ago. At that time the
distinguished Frenchman was professor in a.
university in his native land, and came to
probe social problems on this side. With
Him, or here about the same time, was M.
Andre Siegfried, who returns on a second
visit as one of the leaders of the party
due in September. It is related of the late
Albert Metin, first, that he was a Freetrader
(he had since changed his views) when lie
made that long-ago trip—fated to be his
last —this way. And second, that he sol-
emnly recorded in a book relating the won-
ders he had seen the amazing fact that Aus-
tralian farmers (i.e., sheep-farmers, graziers
and squattocracy generally) often “dressed
for dinner.” Instead of the red shirts, nan-
kin breeches and flowing beards in which he
expected to find them cutting damper with a
jack-knife, they were as swallow-tailed as
waiters. More amazing still, he found they
had discarded the Jew’s harp, and concertina
and bought grand pianos for their daughters.
Some of them even had given up the habit
of unbuttoning their waistcoats when the
roast of goat came in.
Agent-General Wade gave his arm. to a
Maoriland girl, Mary Hay Foster, of Auck-
land (the bride’s dad was at home in M.L.)
up the aisle of a Kensington (London)
church, a few weeks ago. Then tin* heroine’s
mother took charge, and handed her over to
her soldier ’groom. He’s Lieut.-Colonel
Stephen Allen, D. 5.0.. a Staffordshire man,
and son of the late W. S. Allen, M.P., of
Woodhead Hall, in the pottery country.
The official opening of the South Coast
Red Cross haven for convalescent soldiers at
Bomaderry was an event of acute interest to
the Coasters. Governor-General Ferguson,
at first mistaken for the village policeman, in
a dark-blue suit and constable-like lid, made
a brief and telling speech, with a sly allu-
sion to himself and to one Dundonald—who
had an estate next to his own in Scotland —
as “landowners, and therefore not so
popular as they might wish to be!
Dundonald,” said his Ex., “had lived
for years in Australia. Then he in-
herited the property and returned home, and
in the kirk the following Sabbath the minis-
ter chose for his text: ‘This is the heir —
come, let us kill him that we may
seize his inheritance,’ or words to that
effect. So I was not surprised at
hearing that Dundonald caught the next
boat for Australia.”
The Red Cross executive (Sydney) feeling
that such a gathering would not be com-
plete without the light of its presence, jour-
neyed to Bomaderry for the opening; but it
was the South Coast’s day. From Kiama to
Coolangatta, from Gerringong to Moss Vale,
from the beautiful Kangaroo A 7 alley to any
hamlet you can remember by the broad
bosom of the Shoalhaven River, the farmer
and settler came. And with them Mrs.
Farmer ancl the Misses Settler. They came
in motor-cars, in carts, on horseback,
hanging on to an inch or two of sulky, bob-
bing up and down in an ancient ’bus,
in old-fashioned gigs, and on foot along
wonderful country roads, emblazoned with
groves of golden wattle. Wide fields,
where the gorgeous coral trees are burst-
ing into bloom, and hills that fold in
luscious green pockets, and snug homesteads,
made a pastoral amphitheatre that included
some of the best farming land in the State.
The Home, standing in spacious grounds,
much trampled on Saturday afternoon, is
beautifully situated in the hamlet. It
holds easily about 52 soldiers. With a wide
balcony to help, in a rush time, more men
can be housed. Small brass tablets on the
doors of airy wards give the name of the
South Coast town or settlement responsible
for their upkeep. The brothers McKenzie,
formerly of Shoalhaven (they’re now in
Queensland), bound themselves over to pay
the rent. Matron Emmott will keep the
V.A.D. girls up to time-table in beeswaxing
floors and washing saucepans. The Cul-
lens (the C.J. is an old Jamberoo boy) were
in the throng of visitors from Sydney, with
Commandant George Lee and his lady. The
Macarthur Onslcws motored to the scene,
and the Throsbys steered their petrol-chaise
from Moss Vale to the party. Mark Morton,
M.L.A. for the district, mentioned the dona-
tions —over £2OOO in hand. Mayor Shepherd
(Berry) and Mayor Bennett (Nowra) wel-
comed the Governor-General. So there were
no ruffled feathers.
Governor-General Ferguson motored on
from Bomaderry on Saturday afternoon, in
a smart shower of rain, to finish the week-
end at the Jervis Bay Naval College. The
mariner now in charge, Commander Grant,
is making the sailor boys’ training-school a
very popular national institution.
The Royal Art Society’s annual show, the
39th, opens on Monday, September 2, in the
galleries of the Education Department in
Loftus-street. This year the mulberry-stain
walls have been spring-cleaned and painted
a demure buff color, the shade that doesn’t
assault the eye and distract the patron from
his fell purpose.
The matinee organised by the Tait firm
in the Palace Theatre last week brought
a substantial cheque into the lockers of the
American-Australian League of Help. But
it won’t stay there. The League is merely
the channel by which the money goes, via
the Red Cross, to feed our starving pris-
oners of war in Germany. One of the
memories of the show was the frock
in which Mrs. Guy Bates Post looked
like a grey dove with a heavenly blue plume
on her head. The passengers and crew of
the American mail-steamer which arrived in
Sydney on the day of the performance sent
along £72 as their contribution to the cause.
This brave Sydney
girl is Sergeant-
Chauffeur Olive
Kelso King, of the
Servian army, and
at present detailed
for duty at the medi-
cal headquarters in
Salonika. She is one
uf the veterans of
the war. She was in
England when the
tumult started, and
immediately volun-
teered for service—
any kind of service
—at the Front. As
she was a competent
amateur motor-driver
and possessed an in-
stinct for mechanics,
which she soon brought into practical shape
for service conditions, her offer was promptly
accepted. Leaving England with the Scot-
tish Women’s Hospital unit as ambulance-
driver, she lived and worked through the
horrors of the German rush into Flanders.
Three years ago the Scottish healers moved
further afield to face the dangers of succor-
ing the wounded in Servia. Of the heroism
of these gently-reared women, who calmly
moved about amidst the crash of guns and
bandaged battered humanity amidst the riot
of burstihg shells, Mrs. Elizabeth Abbott
recently told Sydney many thrilling tales.
Mrs. Harley, a sister of General French,
died of wounds, and many nurses and doc-
tors went down typhus-stricken weekly. But
the girl who joined as a “private” (a penny
a day was her official pay) in the Servian
army, and is now sergeant-chauffeur, has
come through untold perils almost without
a scratch. She has faced Death near the
battle-zone, or crossing flooded rivers with
her ambulance, so' often that she must have
become familiar to the rustle of its wings.
Olive Kelso King asks Australians to do
something for the heroic Serbs. They are
in desperate straits for the, poorest kind of
food. The proposal, which has the hearty
assent of the military authorities, is to estab-
lish a Servian canteen in Salonika. It will
eventually become self-supporting, but
£lO,OOO is needed to give it a solid founda-
tion. Most of Salonika’s business quarters
were swept away by fire earlier in the war.
The wily Greek and other local traders seized
the chance to exploit the unfortunate Serbs.
So the soldiers, who lost all when they
lost their country, can hardly buy sufficient
to eat to keep them alive. Subscriptions
may be forwarded to the hon. treasurers
(banker Russell French is one) at 118
Pitt-street, Sydney.
Mrs. Clifford Pain (her late husband was
son of the cleric who, until recently, bish-
oped in Gippsland) adds another name to
the long list of war widows. Her man was
recently killed in France.
There’s “A Corner of Blighty,” 20 Place
Vendome, Paris, where the Aussies spend
some of their time on leave, which would be
glad of some help. During the past 10
months of its useful career the Corner has
been a home touch for 44,000 soldiers. Aus-
tralian. British, Canadian and American
cap-and-apron wearers do all the work, and
cheer up our war-worn heroes of the West-
ern Front. It costs the boys nothing for
the use of a good library, tea-and-music
rooms and a cosy place to write their letters.
Cigarettes, tea, sugar, biscuits, etc., sent
to Miss Butler (founder and manager)
“Corner of Blighty,” A.P.O.S. 5, 8.E.F.,
France, pay no Customs duty.
Captain Alan Garbett, one of the first
lot to hurry into khaki in 1914, celebrated
a few weeks’ furlough by being present at
his wedding. The bride, who was also pre-
sent, was Maude Jacob, of Homebush,
daughter of A. I' 1 . Jacob, of Ingera, in that
suburb.
In Sydney, looking for better health
and already finding it, Ethel de Cas-
tilla, of Victoria. For 25 years this
delicate mortal —now resting eyesight that
jibbed at newspaper work —shook a versatile
pen on the Inky Way. During the last
few years Miss de Castilla, no longer in any
kind of harness, has taken on honorary jobs
in connection with her pet hobby—Gregan
McMahon’s Repertory plays, and the Club
wherein budding talent meets to discuss
itself. Of George Reid, Australia’s old
friend, the Victorian has a very pleasant
memory. She was in. England in fateful
1914, and published a book of verse just as
the bolt fell. Having asked the stout gentle-
man to read it, he approached the task
with legal caution and secured the lady’s
promise that she wouldn’t mind if lie said
what lie thought about it. “He opened it,
read on, and at last looked up with a greatly
relieved expression. ‘Why, this is charming,’
lie said. ‘l’ll send a copy to a friend on the
press?’ It got a sheaf of good notices,”
mused the writer, “but the sudden tragedy
of war blotted it out as a commercial proposi-
tion.” Ethel de Castilla (grandfather was
a Spaniard, who settled in England as a
young man) will be happily remembered for
the first two stanzas in her graceful poem,
“An Australian Girl.”
A member of the Australian press delega-
tion drops a line from New York en route, to
London. “I forget how many years ago since
George Bibbs d —d Chicago, but we found it
still sizzling. Even almost overpowering
hospitality couldn’t switch off the heat of
U.S. i i^i July. South of Cape York, we have
it in quality. Business men were wandering
about the streets with their coats under
their arms, looking for strangers and iced
water.... But they’re going to help us win
the war. There’s no mistake about their
resolution and driving power.”
Stepped ashore from the mailboat and
went on to Melbourne, Leila Doubleday, the
Victorian violinist, who had such thrilling days
in Europe when Germany burst its swelled
head. In Austria in the autumn of 1914 (she
had studied earlier in Vienna, and since then
mostly in Switzerland), the Australian girl
was about the most delighted passenger
aboard who saw Sydney Heads last week
from the U.S. boat’s deck. Leila’s musical
mother —or was it an aunt? —was very kind
to Amy Castles in the years that are dust.
Historic old St. Patrick’s Church, on
Church Hill, almost opposite the kirk in
which the late militant Dill Macky once
thundered the Word, is in charge of French
priests. Their golden jubilee has just been
celebrated in the crowded city parish in
which they have so long toiled and kept the
peace with their Presbyterian neighbors
across the way.
The Sydney depot
of the Australian
Flying Corps’ Com-
forts (there’s another
hive in Melbourne
and a small circle in
Adelaide working for
our bird-men) is ap-
propriately housed on
a top floor. On
Thursday afternoon
at a general meeting
Colonel Reynolds,
chief of our Flying
Corps, home for a
short time on an air
mission, gave an in-
teresting address.
Major Sliel d o n
brought words of ap-
preciation from the
depots at the Front for steady supplies of
comforts. It wouldn’t be such a “demnition
grind,” as Mr. ’Mantaline would have
called it, if every woman with a
friend or relative fighting in the air vault
would bear a hand with the depot in her own
city. Mrs. Clark is president of the ener-
getic lot who work in Wentworth Avenue—
-59a. The lady photographed is the lion,
secretary, Mrs. Hardy.
Constance Victoria Paul, now Mrs. Gore,
by the way, has beep trying her hand at
miniature painting for some time. She
was a dainty bridal figure, beside her stal-
wart soldier, in a cloud of ninon and tulle
over her shimmering satin frock. Pie’s been
over two years in the thick of warfare, and
is that Lieut. Fred Gore, formerly of Cam-
booya station (Q.). who was in the Malay
States when Europe started to go up in
smoke.
The last stitches will soon finish a filmy
trousseau for an October wedding. In the
month of roses, Alice, only daughter of Dr.
and Mrs. Cecil Purser, of Wahroonga. will
accept a plain gold ring from Donald Nettle-
ton, of the same hamlet.
A Sydney University girl, Kathleen Her-
lihy, drops in from the United States with
a few flattering remarks about the original
methods of that country. For instance, she
quotes as a subtle chastisement for both
sexes the following notice which appears on
many railway cars: “What’s the cause? Is
it gallantry or the advent of woman suffrage,
or the war-spirit of self-sacrifice that is daily
causing more men to give up their seats to
women, and more women to be cour-
teous in their thanks V” On the service
flags, that proudly float from almost every
house, a red star takes the place of the blue
when the soldier or sailor of the American
home is wounded. A gold star marks the
death in action of the family’s hero. “Since
the great offensive in France,” continues the
Australian, “red and gold stars are becom-

At last week’s lecture on the Light Horse
and their crusading in Palestine, the lec-
turer’s lantern-slide showed a smart-looking
horseman aboard his mount on the screen.
“I’m not quite sure,” said he, “but I think
that’s Colonel .” A girl, who was watch-
ing eagerly, unconsciously uttered her
thought aloud. “No, it isn’t! That’s Lieut.
Cameron Sharp, of S. Australia.” And
she ought to know, for she’s engaged to the
Light Horseman, who’s been four years at
the sandy front.
Jennne A. RotH, eldest daughter of M.

FRUIT LAXATIVE FOR MAMMA, DAD,
BABY, CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Better than calomel, oil or pills to
clean and regulate liver,
bowels and stomach.
Mother, daddy and the children can always
keep feeling fine by taking this delicious
fruit laxative as occasion demands. Nothing
else cleanses the stomach, liver and bowels
so thoroughly without griping.
You take a little at night, and in the
morning all the foul, constipated waste, sour
bile and fermenting food delayed in the
bowels gently moves out of the system. When
you awaken all headache, indigestion, sour-
ness, foul taste, bad breath, fever and dizzi-
ness are gone; your stomach is sweet, liver
and bowels clean, and you feel grand.
California Syrup of Figs—“Califig”—is a
family laxative. Everyone from grandpa to
baby can safely take it, and no one is ever
disappointed in its pleasant action. Millions
of mothers know that it is the ideal laxative
to give cross, sick, feverish children. Ask
your chemist for a. bottle of “Califig”—Cali-
fornia Syrup of Figs—which has directions
for babies, children of all ages, and, for
grown-ups plainly on the bottle. Remember,
imitations are sometimes substituted, so : look
and see that your bottle bears the name of
California Fig Syrup Company. Hand back
with contempt any other fig syrup. “Califig”
—California Syrup of Figs—is sold by all
chemists in bottles of two sizes. Is. lid. and

Melbourne, August 26, 1918.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Mrs. Major James received an ovation at
Spencer-street on her return from W.A.A.C.
work in France. Returned warrior Coun-
cillor Charlie Atkins led the welcome, and the
Hennessy daine was on hand with a bouquet.
Overseas Clubites and Wattle Leaguers were
amongst the crowd, which also included Mrs.
Brig.-General McNicol. Mrs. James has
two aviator sons; one is out of action with
a sightless eye, the other is convalescing
after a fall and concussion of the brain. She
said good-bye to this son, Lieutenant Ron-
ald. in hospital in England, then journeyed
through America home. On her way to the
Melbourne express in Sydney she suddenly
met this same son, making for the same
train !
Lieutenant Frank Fischer was killed last
week in France. He was well known in
Melbourne with Haughton’s, the wool firm,
and was a brother of singer Elsa Stralia.
According to a recent announcement in
Grand Fleet orders, Australia’s midshipmen
will, receive six weeks’ home-leave on com-
pleting two years’ service. For the original
batch of lads who left the Jervis Bay Col-
lege, the spell will be due at the end of this
year. The first Australian midshipman to
Hie gathered to Davy Jones was a fine lad
named Cunningham, who was drowned in
one of the new submarines. Another of the
lads, MacKenzie, was in the same trouble on
another sub., but he succeeded in gaining the
air-lock and was saved.
Janet and Doris, the two daughters of the
late “Jack” Murray, of Warrnambool, are
launching out for themselves as beauty-
parlor specialists in Collins-street.
From London:—
Protest.—That the British Dominions Woman’s
Sufi rage Union, as at present constituted, has no
right to pass contentious resolutions in the name of
the British Dominion Women when the speakers’
names on the posters advertising the Conference are
all English, the principal speakers English, the vote
open to the public, the majority of whom are
English, and the three principal office-bearers, who
are secretary, press-secretary and treasurer respec-
tively, are English. There is no president or vice-
president, and very few properly constituted del-
egates of affiliated societies. Hon. delegates proposed
some of the resolutions. As the committee refused
to include this protest in their report of the Confer-
ence we resigned.
AGNES E. DOIG,
FLORENCE G. HERRING.
Mrs. Doig and Mrs. Herring, of Sydney,
were Australian delegates.
The Glaciarium indulged in a carnival on
Saturday night. There were seven or eight
prizes and only fancy-dressers were allowed
on the ice. It was crowded, and seats for
onlookers could not be found after the show
started. Rink-manager Russell had deco-
rated the place with a canopy of peach
blossom that dropped its pink petals almost
to the heads of the skaters. Chairman H. B.
Howard Smith sat in a box, and the
Baillieu family and the Lascelles occupied
other pens. Doris Arm.vtage, who carried
off the ladies’ championship of Australia last
week, was among the skaters. “Professor”
Dangle;, who has returned invalided from
the war, is back again as demonstrator; and
Dunbar Poole, the skate-dancer who ran the
Sydnej Glaciarium two years ago, is now
installed as chief vlider.
The Norton Grim wade pair, with flying
son Lieut. Fred, have gone to Bananaland
for a few weeks’ sunshine.
The mayoral O’Donnells, of St. Kilda,
lately gave a party, for which the St. Kilda
Town Hall was divided into sections and the
floor crowded with tables loaded with food.
In addition to the tuck-in there was a long
musical programme. Di Gilio played dance
music occasionally, and the younger toes in
the crowd got restless. Mrs. O’Donnell was
wrapped in a large Paisley shawl cape and a
daughter was in pale blue. Mrs. Agar
Wynne, wearing a high collar of pearls and
diamonds, sat at the chief tables with her
husband, and mounted the dais when he pre-
sented the mayoral pair with a brass fern-
bowl and a long speech.
The widow Staugliton lent her ballroom to
Mrs. Lloyd the other Wednesday night for a
dance in aid of the 6th Brigade Comforts
Fund. It was a night of pouring rain, but
the South Yarra and Toorak girls arrived
in swarms.
The children’s charities will appeal to good
citizens on Wattle Day, Friday, September
20. Committees are already getting busy.
The Prahran Red Crossers gave Mayoress
Einbling a gold card-case at a party last
week. Mrs. Einbling, in her turn, gave silver
presents to Mrs. Secretary Young, Mrs.
Girdler, Councillor Willis and Town-clerk
Romanis for their hard work. It was a
general square-up.
Poor Walter Kirby goes from one hospital
to another. In Brisbane he has again re-
tired to a sick bed. Pleurisy is the latest
affliction.
Vair Dodds Lyon went off to India with
hubby Gordon Lyon, who is to control ship-
ping arrangements between Australia and
Calcutta. Everything was very hurried, and
Mrs. Dodds was hastily installed in the
Lyon house in charge of the children.
Ex-Gaud Mayor Hennessy’s portrait (by
Webb) was unveiled in the reception-room
at the Town Hall on Friday afternoon.
Stapley (in large round glasses) occupied
Ins mayoral throne, Hennessy was at his
right hand, and Mrs. Stapley supported the
llennessy dame on the left. One man kept
referring to Hennessy’s “business” in his
speech, and David during his return of
thanks informed the up-to-date person that
he had retired from business 27 years ago.
Artist Webb referred to his subject as
captivating.” A small replica portrait and
a string of pearls were presented to the
Hennessy better-half. Merchant Howard
Berry lingered lovingly over the gams. The
recipient, in brown ninon, although nervous
made the speech of the day.
Buckley’s ball was a gorgeous spectacle in
Melbourne Town Hall. The dancers whirled
under a sort of tented roof composed of
hundreds of yards of silk strips (the silk
will be probably “thrown out” as a bargain
at the next sale) and deep pendant silk
shades to the chandeliers. The electrics
were all turned low and streams of colored
light were flooded from corners of the bal-
cony. Sometimes the dancers were bathed
m twilight-purple, sometimes in scarlet and
olt-times in a rose-pink radiance. One of
the handsome mannequin girls wore flesh-
pink tights and two flowing strips of cloth-
oi gold. She was a dream.
The mayoral Wynnes, of Kew, who are
nearing the end of their long innings, gave
&n At Home to their official brethren and
sistein last Friday. Irma Caron warbled
fetchingly, and the company got the surprise
ot its life when Mrs. Caron, Irma’s mother,
sang Tosti’s “Good-bye” in a voice as clear
and strong as a girl’s.
Miss Philadelphia
Robertson, who was
made 0.8. E. (Order
of the. British Em-
pire), will shortly
receive the decora-
tion, which consists
of a large gold cross
hung from a purple
shoulder ribband.
Miss Robertson is an
Australian and
sister of the famous
Rev. Hume Robert-
son. She had a good
bu s i ness training,
and early in the
war was working in
England for the Red
Cross. As official
secretary of the head-
quarters of the Australian Red Cross she is
the right hand of Lady Helen Ferguson. Her
quarters are at Federal Government House.
When the work started, Miss Robertson was
stationed in the State dining-room, but sit-
ting on a red velvet chair which was sur-
mounted by a gold crown, she was oppressed
by the opulent, unbusiness-like stateliness of
the surroundings. Then Lady Helen allowed
her to be skied to the tower-room, which
opens on to the leads of the ballroom roof
and has a glorious view. It was the den of
the late Major Quilter, and when he went
to England, just before the war, Captain
Tommy Curwen moved in, and loved the
view so much that he reserved it against his
return. But it was not to be. Poor Curwen
went down in the big fight.
Adelaide’s gossip:—
The sum of £2O was eashlioxed for ihc purchase
of comforts for the Third Light Horse as the result
of a concert given by the pupils of the Blind, Deaf
and Dumb Institution at Brighton on Saturday. On
the same day Walkerville held the second of its
monthly Paddy’s Markets, the proceeds of which
are split between Trench Comforts and Red Cross.
The casualties mount up. Major Wells, of the
A.A.M.C., who enlisted in 1914, has died from
wounds; Lieut. A. Wald, another 1914 man, has been
killed in action; Lieut. Degenhardt, whose father
was at one time mayor of Port Pirie, has died of
wounds, so lias Corporal Colin Greig, a son of one
of the oldest members of the Stock Exchange. Lieut.
Wald, who won his M.C. early in the year and had
been recommended for a bar to it, had only just
returned to duty after an accident.
The League of Loyal Women, which is about the
biggest patriotic society born of the war, had its
annual business meeting on Tuesday afternoon with
the Galway lady in the chair. The membership has
now topped the 10,000 mark, and in the Trench
Comforts branch of its work alone the takings for
1917-18 show an advance of over £16,000 on the
previous year’s figures.
Two of the last batch of V.C.’s have fallen to
South Australians, though one of them, Lance-
Corporal Axford, is a West Australian by enlistment.
The one of whom this State can claim undisputed
possession is Corporal Philip Davey, who already
had four wound stripes and the M.M. to his credit.
Hi? four brothers all enlisted, one of them when he
was still under 15, and altogether the family list
has a V.C., three M.M.’s and a French decoration.
Davey’s latest distinction brings its third V.C. to
our pioneer battalion, the 10th. He won it in a
daylight attack by bombing a machine-gun crew,
capturing the gun and using it in beating off a
counter effort.
Lawyer Stanley Skipper has got his commission
and is booked to sail soon.
Mrs. Evelyn O'Leary and her two small daughters
are on their way to New York. Dr. O’Leary returned
to England some months ago with hospital work in
France as his objective.
The Simpson Newlands’ house in North Adelaide
has been sold to the Methodists, who will use it as
a hospital.
Lieut.-Colonel Newman, who has been in tempo-
rary command of the 10th Battalion, has got the
D.S.O. He is reported severely wounded.
For some time it has been believed here that the
Le Huntes had lost both their son and their son-in-
law in the war; but now the good news has come
that one is in Switzerland and the other with his
battery in India.
Particulars have come through of the performance
that won Capt. C. E. Howells, of the Royal Air
Force, his M.C. He was leading a patrol of three on
the Italian front when he saw 10 German ’planes
escorting two double-seaters coming over the Italian
lines. He attacked and brought down four
machines himself, while one of his companions
accounted for two others, and the balance were
driven down. In pre-war days he held a commission
in the citizen forces, but resigned it to get to the
front as a private.
W. J. Denny, at one time Attorney-General of
S.A., and still a member of the Assembly—he was
re-elected last March, in his absence —writes to
friends in Adelaide that he is recovered from his
wound, has been given the rank of captain, and
was returning to military duties.
Georgina Thompson, heiress and orphan
of the woolly Hugh Thompsons, of Cocketge-
dong station (N.S.W.), is engaged to Alec
Murphy, a returned Anzac, son of the widow
Murphy, of Mornington. The last-named is
one of the chief teacups in the Alexandra
Club.
Beryl Fanning, now Mrs. F. T. Kingsley
Newell, is honeymooning at Coombe Cot-
tage. Melba was one of the very few wed-
ding guests. She is staying at State Govern-
ment House. Beryl was dainty in white
chiffon and an enveloping lace veil for the
quiet ceremony on Thursday afternoon.
Perhaps it’s because the sporting instinct
is in our blood. Anyhow, even with a high-
class musical function it's marvellous how
things liven up when the sporting element
enters. Last week in the Melb. Town Hall
there was a new departure from the conven-
tional concert line. Two rival choirs —the
Victorian Festival Choir and the Melb.
Choral Union—gave a joint concert. Each
choir sang separately under it* own con-
ductor’, and then they were massed for two
items, each of which gave one conductor a
chance with the combined forces. There were
many advantages. Expenses were halved,
and the receipts were doubled. The interest
was heightened to an intense degree because
the concert almost took on the nature of a
competition. Amongst the audience were
scattered excited little bands of ardent bar-
raekers, and while one conductor was mount-
ing the platform the other would be seen
sprinting round to the front of the house
to be in the best possible position to gauge
effects. From the outstanding success of
the venture there will probably be more of
the kind to follow.
The casual frock-fancier can always find
something to tickle her eye at the Chappell
concerts at the Auditorium. Several of the
lady artists show that fashion has wrestled
with music for the possession of their souls.
Particularly i s this the case with the Melba
protegees, Stella Power and Peggy Center.
The dark-haired Stella sang the other night
in a blue and carmine mixture, with start-
ling shoes and stockings. Peggy Center was
n .°t less picturesque when she tripped into
view on Saturday. Her dressmaker had
confiscated much of the white corsage and
thrown in some sort of wrap, which was
magenta and diaphanous. The skirt was
white in terraces of trimmings, whilst an
imitation red flower, about as large as a
cabbage, was suspended in the same place
where the Australian Scotchman wants to
hang his sporran when he gangs to the war.
Flautist John Amadio’s pretty little wife,
who has been playing hubby’s accompani-
ments, appeared with him at the last munici-
pal concert. She is one of Stock Exchange
I red Roberts’s daughters.
Next month Melba will open a memorial
exhibition of the late Hugh Ramsay’s paint-
ings, at the rooms of the Fine Art Society.
Ramsay was a gifted young Australian, who
went to Europe and had two pictures hung
in the Paris Salon during his first year
there. A damaged lung forced him to hurry
back to Australia; but. even our sunshine
could not save him, and he died in Mel-
bourne 14 years ago, leaving 50 pictures,
mostly portraits, several of them works of
real genius, in the possession of his family.
Ten of the paintings will be on sale, to
public galleries only.
Leila Doubleday, the child artist of a few
years ago, is back in Melbourne with her
violin and her soulful expression. The
photo shows the
latter to advantage.
Yo-ung Leila is
quite what she pro-
mised to become
when her friends
packed her off to
Europe to develop
talent that is near
akin to genius. In
her face there is a
good deal of her
clever mother, to
whom Amy Castles
owed her equipment
for a career. The
war came unkindly
to the brilliant vio-
linist. She had the
bad luck to be per-
forming on Austrian
territory when the horror started, and for
three months she was interned. After her
release she went to London. Later she went
to Switzerland, and for two and a half
years there she made music for repatriated
soldiers.
Rain like that which preceded Noah's
Flood had no effect in stopping the first-
night rush to Polini’s new show, “The In-
visible Foe.” The train and tram people
were overcoated and muffled, but the motored
folk sported boiled shirts and flimsy chif-
fons. Percy Stuart advertised his laundry,
and his lady wore, in conjunction with other
things, some filmy lace and a white swans-
downy cape. Tennis-player Dunlop and Dr.
Murray Morton were in full regalia, and the
Davis pair brightened the circle. Percy
pean’s wife was in a box with a Tait wife
in a rose-tulle gown. Best was among the
starched crowd. Nellie Veitch looked like
Christmas in white fur and holly berries.
The Monasli dame wore , green tulle, and
partied with mining-man Bloch and his fair
daughter. Pol ini got a fine effect by wear-
ing a dull black glacd frock in a room set
with rosewood furniture upholstered in sun-
set pink velvet.
Corporal Abercrombie, now on the**point
of sailing, closed liis ledger in Patterson’s to
get into khaki. He leaves a small son and
daughter with his cheery little wife. Mrs.
Abercrombie was one of the two French
sisters whose mother tied up with violinist
Du Boulay and settled in Sydney. Sister
Sylvia (she was Melba’s particular pet) is
now the wife of N. S. Wales squatter Charlie
Mills.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

DEWARS
In the case of Whisky the
General Verdict is in favour
of Dewar’s on three counts,
MELLOWNESS —PURITY
RELIABILITY
Mellowness. That alluring perfection
of flavour that begets the happy smile of
appreciation. Dewar’s never robs one of
pleasure—be the anticipation never so great.
Its charm, of flavour is elusive and exclusive
—soft, rich and yet crisp.
Purity. The safeguard of health and the
rock on which the reputation of Dewar’s
stands. It is this domination of Purity in
all the stages of preparation that makes
Dewar's the Aristocrat of Whiskies whose
companionship is ever a source of unceasing
delight and happiness.
Reliability is the crowning virtue of
Dewar’s. All its merits in Distillation,
Blending, Purity, Age and Flavour contribute
to this one great end: —that no matter when
or where you buy Dewar’s you can, without
any fear of disillusionment, rely on an unvary-
ing measure of rarest pleasure that makes
Dewar’s a perfect treasure.


That the U-boats will yet be herded inside
an impenetrable barrier of British mines is
the opinion inspired by that wise and endur-
ing spirit King George TV. whisky.— Advt.

How arc the imported nags going to
shape in the big Spring handicaps? bast September-
November the dark ones from England wore more
honored in the preach than the performance. The
previous Spring was a great time for the foreigners.
One of them just missed the Epsom, another won
the Metrop., three? tilled the Caulfield Cup places,
and two of them were only beaten by a Maorilander
(Sasanotf) in Melbourne Cup. There is a stronger
force of imported horses among the entries this
season than ever before, so unless they make a great
show in the results it will seem hardly worth while
to bring horses all the way from Europe for racing
purposes. At present a lot of them look very
dangerous, and it would he interesting to hear the
best price on offer against an English-bred horse
winning the Caulfield Cup, anyhow.
* * * *
Some worth-while racing transpired at
Roseliill (Sydney) on Saturday, one of the results
thereof being to make the argument about the Epsom
more involved than ever. Two performances stood
well out from the rest, and there were a few others
worth noticing. Poitrina, starting at 9 to 4, won
a division of the Highweight, six furlongs, with list.
91b. aboard. Cerise Colors beat a first-class field in
the Auburn Handicap, seven furlongs, carrying Bst.,
at a write-your-own-ticket price in the ring. The
main point about these happenings is that Poitrina
has 9st. 61b. in the Epsom, and Cerise Colors, a
hard-worked battler from the pony courses, 7st. 61b.
There is nothing in the big mile that on recent
running looks anything like so good as these two,
just now anyway.
In the Highweight Poitrina was giving the im-
ported Louvetier 241 b., Bimeter 131 b., Franco 321 b.,
and others up to only a few pounds below Aewt.
She ran off with a six-lengths lead, was cantering
over the last half-furlong, and won pulling up in
“lffj.” Previous races had shown that weight
matters nothing to this very beautiful mare, and
Saturday’s gallop was strong confirmation. Of course
she may not run out a mile. She failed in the
Doncaster with 9st. lib. ; but it is worth remember-
ing that at two years old she won the A..LG. Easter
Stakes, seven furlongs, and that several things inci-
dental to training Poitrina have been found out late
in the day. She always runs best when “big,” and
worst, when fined down by work. Kelso has her in
rare good condition just now.
Behind Cerise Colors at the end of the Auburn
Handicap were George Graves, Amadis, Volpi, Dame
Acre, Norburv, Portrait, Promised Land, Rebus,
Petalster, Satin Bird, all of which have been backed
for the Epsom—a few with some persistence. Of
course, most of them are yet fairly backward in
condition. But Volpi was not. He was backed
like a certainty, and trainer Booth was very confi-
dent about him. Nor was Promised Land wanting
in condition. For him there was firm support, and
the George Graves and Portrait people were moder-
ately hopeful. Naturally since he had been run to
a short price for the Epsom, the travelling Volpi
was watched with greatest interest. He got away
fairly well, was conveniently placed at the turn, and
coming through on the rail was in front just below
the Leger. There he was done and finished tefitli,
after covering the last furlong as rapidly as a
barrowful o’ bunnies. Meanwhile, Cerise Colors had
been arguing the point with George Graves, King’s
Word and Amadis; He shook them off. Then the
Sydney Cup winner Rebus came flying along at a
mile a. minute —-just too late. The ex-pony struck
the line with his head to spare. Amadis was doing
fairly well at the end. George Graves will do
better presently. His /condition can be much im-
proved. Portrait shut up at six furlongs, and finished
last.
Earlier in the week Rebus was backed for both
the Epsom and the Metrop, a circumstance which it
is not likely the prad’s running on Saturday caused
the stable to regret. Rebus is a very versatile
animal. Over a mile it is against him that he
begins badly, but over the last furlong or two be
can unwind himself at a phenomenal rate. Previous
to the Sydney Cup win he had shown this several
times. He is a common-looking chap, and sweats
himself into a lather with excitement before getting
on the course.
Louvetier, an imported horse with a poor record,
trained by W. Booth at Roseliill, carried a heavy
wad in Poitrina’s race. He got away very badly,
though that made no difference. The noticeable
thing was tlrat at the finish he was ahead of them
all, except the flier in front. For some reason or
other this nag is under popular suspicion of being
something special. Saturday’s exhibition didn’t sup-
port this much, but the fact that Louvetier is still
on the large side and a conspicuously good looking-
moke may be no cause for expecting him not to be
beard from subsequently. He is in the Epsom with
7st. 101 b.
Kennaquhair, big and lusty looking, made 14
others look like hacks in the Rosohill Handicap on
Saturday—-which is rust what most of them are.
Tie parted company from the rest at the turn, and
running on arrived four lengths ahead of the im-
ported Publican, Old Cagou was a trier, but never
looked like having a chance. Most likelv he reckons
the time is ripe for a rest. Most stallions .do long
before their ninth year.
Kennaquhair was favorite for the Metro-
politan before winning Roseliill Handicap on Satur-
day, and shortened to something that had to be
looked for with a microscope soon after. He may
be at a better price on the day than he was early
in the week. As he carried 9st. at Rosehill, where
the first five furlongs were run in lmin. 34sec., and
finished the mile and a quarter going easily in 2min.
7sec., the circumstance of having' Sst. 41b. in the
Metropolitan doesn’t seem to count against him on
the time test.
Adrian Knox, chairman of the A.J.C., in
some remarks the other day about the abolition of
place-betting, said he had often been amazed at the
odds accepted by the public from the place-fielders.
There is nothing remarkable in this, but it would be
interesting to know whether Knox’s amazement
extends to the odds the public take about places
under the 60, 20, 20 totalisator system. It cannot
have escaped his notice that the odds are often more
wildly insane than anj'thing the most ravenous place-
holder ever tried to perpetrate. There are occasions
when there are no odds at all—-when the backer of
a second or third runner is handed back less than
he put up. If there is anything to be said for such
happenings as that this page would like to hear
what it is, but though the request for information
has been many times made nobody breaks the
silence. Take the second and third place-bets paid
by the machine at Rosehill on Saturday: Maiden —
13 to 1, evens. Highweight—First division, second
horse backers lost 25 per cent, of their stake, third
2 to 1 ; second division, second backers lost 40
per cent, of their stake, third backers laid 20 to 1
“on.” Rosehill Handicap—s to 2 and 2 to 1.
Parramatta Mile —Second backers lost 20 per cent.,
third 7 to 1. So in five races the punter on n place
could find a place-getter each time and lose on three.
Just compare this: At Rosehill (Sydney)
on Saturday the tote was considered to have “done
well,” the turnover being ,£12,171 on six races.
At the recent Winter Meeting of the Canterbury
Jockey Club (M.L.) the turnover was ,£127,665 in
two days; There were a couple of days’ trots at
Christchurch during the same week and .£92,144
went through the machine, making £219,759 for the
four days’ proceedings. On the last race of the
four days there was £12,286 on the machine—
over £lOO more than went on all day at Rosehill.
Of course, in a way, these M.L. figures can be taken
as indisputable evidence of public lunacy and positive
proof that the allegation about the machine having
a restricting influence on punting is a silly old gag;
but that is not the point of the arithmetic when
considering the manner of the totalisator’s use in
N. S. Wales in comparison with other places.
In M.L. the machine gets practically all the betting,
or at any rate all the betting on the ground. Here-
abouts it gets the fag end.
W * #
Herbert Gilbert, the skipper of West-
ern Suburbs (Sydney) League team, shouldered
the job of moulding the outfit into shape in 1916.
The club promptly
turned itself into the
last joint in the pre-
miership tail, winning
two matches out of 14 !
In t li e following
season Gilbert coaxed
the Wests into fourth
place. This season they'
jumped into second
placed in the premier-
ship and landed the
City Cup. Gilbert
stands clear over all
other Sydney Club
captains in leadership.
He is not a great
scorer—only half a
dozen tries were actu-
ally credited to him
this season, but if the
line is near and the
shadow of an opening
shows itself Gilbert
will get the ball over
if he has it. He has
played football in
Maori land, England and
Australia.
H. GILBERT
( W. Suburbs,
Sydney), skipper
of City Cup
winners.
There was wild cheering out at Victoria
Park (Sydney) on Saturday when the div. on
Larinot, winner of the second division of the
Encourage Stakes, was hoisted on the totalisator.
Only two tickets on Larinot were registered on the
machine, and the lucky holders drew £lO5 3s. 9d.
each. One of the ticket proprietors was a returned
soldier, who was half shares with a mate. The
other was a civilian. A curious feature of the
matter is that even the trainer of the winner never
regarded the nag seriously. The horse never visits
the training track, and almost any afternoon can be
seen with the owner’s daughter aboard being hacked
round Botany.
“F.” : The'late John Hill, who long time
trained racers at Glenelg (S. Aus), seemed to have
modelled his style to match his pleasant-looking face.
At the time he brought Auraria to Melbourne to
win Derby and . Cup (Wallace beat the game little
mare in the Derby), Hill bore a general resemblance
to the English trainers of half a century earlier. His
clean-shaven face suggested the old-fashioned stud
groom of old sporting prints. His claim to have
gone straight all his racing days was doubtless an
honest claim. He might have sat for a picture of
Rectitude—in the turf sense of the term before the
turf changed for the worse. One of Alf Vincent’s
pages of Melbourne Cup characters included a very
good portrait of Hill, with a saddle over his arm,
talking to David James, the owner of Auraria.
The “old course” at Victoria Park.
Adelaide, will always remain a sort of enchanted
ground for a railway-man of Ballarat (Vic.)- He
drew Pistolier in the G. N. Hurdles of S.A., and the
chances seemed so good that he resolved to take a
hand in person. He first took the 400-mile journey
to Adelaide, made handsome (though really unneces-
sary) promises to owners and jockey, and then stood
by and saw the bearer of his fortunes —something-
well over £3OOO was still “going for’’ him —come
home practically alone. The old Pistol-Enigma geld-
ing carried list. 131 b., and was giving over a stone
to everything else.- He is a Port Adelaide Cup
winner on the flat, and though strong over hurdles
in S.A.. thirds have been his best at Flemington and
Caulfield.
S.A. thinks it may have a really good
three-vear-old in Bullock and Patterson’s Stagegirl
(Comedy King—Petruvia). She was clearly that
State's best two-year-old, and has started the new
season by winning the Adelaide Guineas. Fitness,
the only other well backed, was a bad third, but
McLachlan’s Paratoo (Pistol-Xena Bell) ran Stage-
girl to half a head. The Fulham Park Plate winner,
Allen and Yates’s Lord Setay (St. Anton-Lady Dud-
ley), is another boost for the local sire. He won
comfortably from Mrs. Hawker’s much-better-fancied
Arrasene (The Welkin-Chenille), bought last March,
and still in Scobie's hands for training.
“Trot” : The explanation of what “blinds
and paralyses” the men (B. 15/8/’IS) who encour-
age! the 2-year-old racing they know ought to be
either repressed or prohibited is that, this racing
creates a demand for young horses and keeps prices
up. Of course there would be an equal demand, and
prices would not be hurt in the end if the stakes
were up for 3- and 4-year-olds, but asNthe breeder
doesn’t see that way there is a vicious circle work-
ing. The influence of breeders is in the direction of
paying big stakes for 2-year-old journeys in order
that the occasional topnoteher can win a hatful and
set buyers competing for more topnotchers at the
next sales. Those people who argue against 2-year-
old racing, and particularly against the running of
fillies at that stage, are undoubtedly right. Every
trainer knows this. So, too, does every man who
watches racing from the outside with intelligent
eyes. Someone ought to prepare a tabulated state-
ment each year showing what had been done with
every nag from the yearling stage upwards, and
collect the details of training-stable ruination into
Statistical information .convertible into terms of cash
—wasted and otherwise. The results would be sur-
prising, even to the most confirmed hater of present,
methods. The waste of horse and the waste of cash
and effort are among the outstanding features of
racing, and most of it is due to abuse of the
immature animal.
A. McPherson, the miniature five-eighth
of Western Suburbs (Sydney), who topped the
scoring with 96 points (45 goals and tw T o tries),
had the busiest time in N. S. Wales ltugby League
this season. His job was to kick the club to victory,
and bo was a faithful servant. Although he headed
Western Suburbs’ aggregate scores in ’96 arid ’97
this season was his best in the League. Harold
Horder (South Sydney) was close up with 92 (22
tries and 13 goals). Other be'avy scorers were F.
Burge (Glebe) with 83 (27 tries and one goal) ;
Wally Messenger (Eastern Suburbs), 77 (7 tries and
28 goals) ; arid A. Oxford (South Sydney), 75 (7
tries and 27 goals). As most of these players have
been at the top of their club efforts for many years,
the League cannot blame itself for dragging many
new stars into the limelight.
The sprint championship of N. S. Wales
Rugby League on Saturday temporarily allayed the
high-talk which has wafted around Sydney football
enclosures during the season. In the 50 yfrds Tom
Boland (Wests) won from S. Cunningham (Easts)
and Harold Horder (Souths) in 5 4-ssec. In the
100 yards, Horder won from S. Hughes (Annan-
dale) and Cunningham in 10 3-ssec. The aggregate
of points gave Ilorder the title. As the sprinters
carried football togs and boots it looks as if the
timekeepers were dreaming when the gun went.
Next time the League runs off a championship it
might reasonably make competitors carry a ball.
Side by side with the war cables posted
outside Melbourne Age last Saturday afternoon was
the special announcement that a football match had
been postponed on account of the rain.
* * * *
Last week-end the Metropolitan Cup, the
last of the important metropolitan coursing events,
was decided at Liverpool (N.S.W.). The stake
brought out 32 dogs, and White Wonder, Down the
South and Wild King were joint favorites in a very
good betting stake at 6 to 1. White Wonder was
knocked out in the first round, and Wild King and
Down the South went under in the first ties. After
that Grand Crystal was favorite, with Black Corsair
and Our Corsair next in demand. Once again the
public were off the target. Grand Crystal was
beaten pointless in the third ties hv Black Corsair,
and Our Corsair heat Vera Hope. As both Corsairs
run in the same ownership they divided the stake.
The winners are puppies by Corsair (imp.) out of
Daisy Dell, and as they are only 18 months old
their performance in heating older tvkes suggests
big things to come. Only three Corsair pups have
run in Svdney to date, and they have won three
stakes. The Metropolitan Purse and Plate for bow-
wows beaten in the first round and first ties of the
Cup were won by Hope’s Bride and Wild King.
A feature of the meeting was the clash of
Wayback Tilly, who has now run five seasons and in
addition has reared two families. She won her first
course in the Cup, but was beaten in the first ties,
In the Metropolitan Plate she got into the last four.
*** ' *
The Werribee Coursing Club’s meeting
(Vic.) proved disastrous for N. S. Wales dogs. In
the Comedy King Challenge Stakes for 16 dogs at
20 guineas each, the N. S. Wales animals were
drawn against each other in the first round. That
meant half of them going out first pop. Tn the
second run Beauty Spot was beaten by Quair Hope,
runner-up a few weeks back to Achieved in the
Waterloo Cup at Booty Hill. Beauty Spot’s failure
was a sad knock to local coursing, the Stake being
regarded as hers for the asking. To make matters
worse, Bramble, a kennel mate of Beauty Spot, was
beaten in the thi'rd round of the Bracelet Stakes at
the same meeting. The consolation the downcast
brigade got was to see Quair Hope and Another
Century, winners from Beauty Spot and Bramble
respectively, each annex the stake.
Ihe fiist stage of the battle between the
Lmdrums tor the Australian billiard champion-hin
at Sydney last week would have been more interest
ing it it hadn t been a family affair. The biggest
break was Walter's 524. Fred rattled up 234°and
3/6_ a.t the same session. The half-wav scores were
Walter, 8900; Fred, 7100—a lead of'lBoo for the
younger player. During the previous fortnight
}' 0 ™ r was busy conceding \\\. Abotomev 0000 in
18,000, and came out with a surplus of 2451.
“0.K." ; Head the other day in Melb.
that ‘‘ thc 17 sportsmen who attended the
i1.0.C. grounds on Saturday enjoyed an afternoon's
starling shooting.” Why this insistence on the
term sportsmen? The murder of a dozen trapped
stallings without a miss hardly entitles a man to
pose as a sportsman. Tiger-hunting is sport. Fox-
hunting is sport where the country is difficult, and
the horsemen take some risk of breaking their necks.
Rowing, cricket, footracing, football and swimming
matches are sport. Horse-racing is sport, inasmuch
as it involves the breaking-in and (raining of mettled
steeds, and the risky riding of them bv skilled
athletes who are employing their wits at high ten
sion. But shooting small birds on a gun-club ground i
It’s about as sporty as the solemn winter dissipation
of curling, which consists in giving a gentle pu«h
to a polished iron weight on a polished ice track.

“Camelero” : This is one of Billjim’s little
games in Southern Palestine. A ring is made in
the sand with eight openings marked in the circle,
each opening being marked from one to six.- A
Scarab beetle is then dropped in the centre of the
ring and Billjim’s cash is piled on the various num-
bers. The Scarab is then given a start, and which-
ever opening in the ring it departs from the bettor
who has his cash on this opening fathers in the
piastres. I won £3 in one afternoon.
“B.” : The Gregory family (B. 22/8/’18)
holds a unique spark in Australian cricket.
In April. 1871, Dave, Ned and Charles
Gregory (N.S.W.) played Sam Costick, Con-
way and Tom Wills (Vic.) in a single-wicket match
on the old Albert Ground, Sydney. The Gregorys
won by 54 to 49. The match caused more excite-
ment than a fire. Shortly after the game began
umpire Thompson no-balled Dave Gregory. The
next ball Gregory swung his arm. and the ump.
again called “No-ball!” but Dave had the ball in
his hand. Umpire, players and a crowd of 5000
then got entangled in air argument, which raged till
Bill Caffyn took Thompson’s place. These three
Gregorys were also in the N, S. Wales team against
Victoria in ’7l, with Nat .Thompson (captain),
Monty Faithfull, George Moore, Dick Hewitt, Ned
Sheridan, Joe Coates, Bill Caffvn and Charlie Ban-
nerman.
“Wart”: Re the Speck’s mountain
shrimp, mentioned .by “D.F.” (B. 25/7/T8). The
little chap seems to be fairly common in most of
Tassv’s streams right down to where they feel the
tide influence. Fishing for blaekfisli in the First
Basin, just above Launceston, I once pulled a shrimp
up on the bait, which was. an ordinary common
worm. Then I pulled the worm off and put the
shrimp on for bait, and it was not long before I
pulled out a blaekfisli. That gave me an idea, and
next time I went fishing J took some sea shrimps
and caught one of the best bags of blaekfisli that
I had ever caught. The only better bait I know of
for blackftsh is a piece of boiled, freshwater crayfish.
“Dale”: Can anyone beat these instances
of queer behaviour on the part of bullets? I
was out with a fisherman on the Murray when he
took a shot" at a swan flying overhead. He fired
with the pea-rifle straight into the air and the pellet
struck the water about three feet from the boat. We
found the bird subsequently on the edge of the
billabong and the bullet had ploughed straight down
the breast-bone and glanced down to the water again.
On the way home lie fired at a rabbit which was
squatting in the fork of a fallen tree. The bullet
slid round the fork, missed the rabbit, and hit the
ground almost at our feet. It was a most interest-
ing day.

Many people think they have kidney
trouble because they have backache, but
more backache is caused by over-strained

blood the rheumatism cannot be cured, to
Stay cured, until the blood is built up.
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills build up the

O.B.: “Our Native Land” gets -us:—■
Oh Australians! Australians of this beautiful coun-
try we own.
Fight for our native land of which we are born ;
Never let our enemies see that we are fly-blown,
But show the world the grit we’ive borne.
Oh, Never let us see Australia’s doom,
In a country of plenty and plenty of room ;
For there’s not a better country with a Kingdom,
That ever acted with more wisdom.
Fight for your country, your native soil,
Think, think, to have to be drove to toil:
Its enough to make ones heart flutter and boil,
Fight, fight, and settle this turmoil.
Oh Australians! Australians when will you realise,
We’re fighting the worst enemies under the skies;
Go: go and fight where your brethren lies,
Soften your hearts and hear their cries.
Oh Australians! Australians have you no fear
No sympathy to show or to shed a tear;
For the loved ones that’s gone this four year,
Bring it to your thoughts and give up this blare.

Thomas Corbin, of Adelaide, just dead at
75, was the senior doctor, by registration, of
South Aus. He was under Paget at Bar-
tholomew’s Hospital, London, in the early
’sixties, and came to Australia in 1864 as
surgeon on the sailing-ship Orient. His
first job was on the Burra (S.A.) copper-
mine, but he soon became house-surgeon at
the Adelaide Hospital and worked up a large
private practice. He had been living in re-
tirement for some years, but two clever sons.
.John and Cecil, carry on the family pro-
fession.
It is now officially announced that the
Rev. Paul Joseph was killed in Prance last
May, at the time when he was, reported
missing. An eloquent preacher, he rather
carried the Congregationalists of Adelaide
off their feet two or three years ago. He
was a son-in-law of old Dr. Bevan, and had
a reputation as a financier which turned
out to be undeserved. A Tasmanian legacy
was a misfortune to him. He bought the
late Chief Justice Way’s splendid home, took
the deeds of Hindmarsh Square church to a
bank and financed the building of a “Temple”
on a commanding North Terrace site. It
is known that he made no personal profit
out of these transactions, but who is to stand
the loss has hardly been settled even yet.
Anyhow building was suddenly stonned with
the walls a few feet up (as they still
remain), and the preacher enlisted as a
private. As The Bulletin remarked then,
his career was like melodrama, all through.
The last act was finely played.

This is an exact replica of leather, with the same
grains and the same colourings. It has all the charm
of leather but costs only one quarter the price and is
better in every way. It wears better, does not crack or
peel and is unaffected by stains or grease, and is germ and
insect proof. It gives years of service and never gets
shabby, as it can be washed if soiled.
For all upholstering — furniture , motor cars, railway

Business, Robbery, etc,
Price-fixing has some elements of humor.
Australia has devoted 50 years to promoting
reliance on imported goods, so that, as regards
nine articles out of ten, we have no
voice in deciding the price; also in
shoving nearly half the population of
the continent into four cities, so that
the things we produce locally—meat, butter,
wheat, etc. —may have to travel the longest
possible distances to a market. Then it
provided breaks of railway gauge to make
sure that the goods will be bogged as much
as possible on the way to market, and prac-
tically gave up shipbuilding to make sea-
carriage to the markets as difficult as pos-
sible. Finally it became excited and started
to put everything right in a day by declaring
that though the principal causes of the
trouble must not be interfered with, the
effects were prohibited.

“Hawker”: lie the damfoolish conserva-
tism of Australian manuiacturers, noted by
“Australia Preferred” (B. 25/'7/’IS). Years
ago I pointed out to certain importers that
the ordinary English-made enamelled sauce-
pan was a slippery, capsizable affair, and
asked why they didn’t order straight-sided
vessels, like a stewpau, only deeper. They
told me they had done so often, but that
the British declined to depart from estab-
lished methods —that if the importers didn’t
like his goods they were at liberty to go
without. Similar representations were then
made to German firms, who instantly grabbed
the opportunity to fill the orders. The
article wasn’t wo good, but it was cheaper
and was what the consumer asked for.
Another instance. Soon after a well-
known separator came into use I discerned
an improvement which I thought would
bring cash to the makers and to myself. The
Australian agents were disinterested and
aloof, and finally chivvied me outside. Then
1 wrote to a separator manufacturing firm
in Stockholm, and by return mail got a
courteous reply stating that my notion had
already been adopted, as I would see by the
newest machines. They invited me to offer them
any other improvements I might evolve, and
promising to pay for them if adopted. The
llun is an uncivilised scoundrel, but there
are many of his business methods we might
adopt with advantage. If we don’t he’ll
have a good show of recapturing his lost
trade.

“O. Ships”: If the Federal Government
decides in favor of concrete ships when it
comes out of its long trance, Geelong (Vic.)
will be the first in the business. There is a
site all ready linked by rail with the Fyans-
ford cement works, which are only a few
miles away. Back in February, 1917, E. J.
Stone, of Stone and Siddeley, a firm which
has done a lot of concrete work at Geelong
and elsewhere in Australia, put up a pro-
posal to build concrete vessels at Geelong,
and offered to lodge £lO,OOO, to be forfeited
if he did not turn out a satisfactory sea-going
ship. But the Government apparently
reckoned that there was too much business
and too little talk about Stone’s plans and
pitched them out. When Hughes went to
America he found that someone there had
done the trick —but then, of course, the
Americans are terrors for doing things.
* * * *
“0.K.” : Australia, for the number of its
population, must be the largest consumer of
briar pipes of any country in the world.
Millions of pipes are imported, though possi-
bly the mallee-roots of Victoria are as suit-
able for pipe-making as the Italian roots
that we get in manufactured form. The one
thing certain is that new characters in Aus-
tralian woods are being revealed every year.
Perhaps the Melbourne University school of
pipe-making for returned soldiers has some
practical ideas. The Ruwolt works at Rich-
mond (Melb.) lately got a University order
for five pipe-making machines, and will
supply them at cost price.
* * * *
“Rags”: Before an Inter-State Commis-
sion, sitting in Adelaide to investigate the
prices of clothing and boots, the secretary
of the Warehousemen’s Association said
that that body did not fix the prices,
nor was there any understanding regarding
them. The resolutions passed by the mem-
bers were strictly private, but there was no
reason for such privacy. L. C. Hunkin
(representing the Trades and Labor Coun-
cil) mentioned that storekeepers had noticed
there were alterations in travellers’ prices
following the meetings, but Commissioner
Lockyer prevented any reply by interjecting:
“If that is so it will come out. in evi-
dence.” It is a remarkable coincidence
that when inquiring for quotations from
the wholesalers the prices given are exactly
the same in each instance. If the rates are
not fixed there must be an “honorable under-
standing,” with perhaps a heavy fine if the
members depart therefrom. Anyhow, the
“Association price” is an everyday term in
the rag trade, and if one does happen to
get a cut rate the opposition houses are
very anxious to see the invoice.

Another of the Sam Hordern properties
will pass under the hammer in Sydney at the
end of the month. It is the Coronation
Hotel on the corner (N.) of Park and
George streets, a new building. The corner
has been a beer-pump site for many a year.
Tradition says that the father of the first
baronet, Dan Cooper, had a bakery on the
ground. In the ’forties John Greer,
a builder, and father of the late
James Greer, solicitor, owned the property.
About the year 1850 George Simpson, who
had kept the St. Andrew’s Tavern on the
angle of Kent and King streets, and the
Currency Lass, corner of Hunter and Pitt
streets (now Empire corner), opened it as
a pubbery under the sign Simpson’s Hotel;
a few years later it was kept by Charles
Beal, a" name well known in cricket circles,
and the Beals had it well into the ’seventies,
when it became the Town Hall Hotel. On
being rebuilt it became the Commonwealth
and then the Coronation.

DIRECTORS' REPORT.
Presented at the Ordinary General Meeting of Proprietors, held at Winchester House,
Old Broad Street, E.C. 2 ( Hall No. 174), at 12 o'clock noon, oh Wednesday,
May 15, 1918.
The Directors present their Report accompanied as usual by audited accounts for
the year ended 31st December last.
The profits, after deducting management charges, all taxes, including the Federal
Income and Land Taxes and State Government Land and Income Taxes, and providing
for all bad and doubtful debts, amount to £83,245/2/11.
The Directors recommend the payment of a dividend at the rate of 7 per cent, per
annum, less Income Tax, on both the preference and the ordinary shares for the six
months ended 31st December, 1917.
These payments, with the interim dividend paid on the 2nd November, 1917, and
a grant to the Officers’ Provident Fund of £3OOO, absorb £49,399/13/0, leaving a balance
of £33,845/9/5 of the year’s profits, £30,000 of which has been transferred to the
Reserve Fund; the balance of £3845/9/5 is added to the amount brought forward from
last year, thus increasing the amount to be carried forward to £24,526/1/1.
The Reserve Fund is increased to £355,000.
Under the provisions of the Bank’s Articles of Association, the directors retiring
are Mr. Gordon lluntly Campbell and Mr. John Graham O’Neill, who, being eligible,
offer themselves for re-election.
A resolution will be proposed that the remuneration of the directors be increased
from £3OOO to £3500 free of Income Tax. The present amount was fixed in 1893 at a
low level, owing to the circumstances of the Bank, but the business of the Bank has
expanded very greatly since that date, involving increased demands upon the time
and adding largely to the responsibilities of the directors, who therefore feel justified in
asking the shareholders to grant the above increase in the remuneration.
The Bank’s auditors, Messrs. Price, Waterhouse and Co., retire, and again offer
themselves for re-election.
The transfer-books are closed from the 2nd May to the 15th May, both days inclusive.
Warrants for dividends will be issued, payable on and after the 17th May next, to
those shareholders whose names appear on the Register on the 2nd instant.
By order of the Board,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE day’s affairs, with all their squalid
load
Of vain achievements and belittling
aims,
Are past and done with, saving they fore-
bode
A fellow day of like unyielding claims
For ill-graced service, quickened by the goad
Of rebelling Need, that urges as it tames ;
And murmured from the drowsy lips of God
Is Even come, to ease us of our hod
And lead us over vagrom ways with wistful
fancies shod.
The highway from the city passes by,
But all the hum of homeward traffic seems
A requiem mass, made perfect harmony
By muffling distance and the purple streams
Of Even, misting down on land and sea
To drape as with a veil of yearning dreams
The grassy slopes, the streamlet feeding
pond,
The valley densed with nikau leaf and frond,
The battlement of city rooves that blur the
sky beyond.
As some swart beauty wraps a jewelled
shawl
About her gleaming shoulders, so the Night
Wraps all the city ; plying ferries crawl
From shore to shore, with twinkling shafts
of light
Waked on the fluttering waters; off to trawl,
The fishing craft steam seawards out of
sight;
A glimpse of phantom loveliness, aloof
From bawling day’s insistence, sent in proof
Of Beauty’s subtle weavings, woven fair in
warp and woof.
And now it is that Beauty’s self is seen;
She doffs her glad apparelings of Day,
And, as it were her tender mood to wean
Our thoughts from pain and arid cares away,
She pilfers from the moon its silvern sheen,
She borrows from the Dawn her veils of
gray,
And weaves them into garments that caress
Her perfect limbs and lissom, hiding less
Than even more revealing all their rounded
loveliness.
If moonlight fleshed as women were to be.
If music could be truly wrought in line.
It is as these to-night she comes to me
And feys me to a fellowship divine
With her own suave delight: I seem to see
A World Enchanted, its enchantment mine,
And yielding those most intimate delights
Which Hope and Memory cling to, through
the plights
Of Toil and grisly Circumstance, where
little else requites.
Delicious music fills the scented air
With lull and flood of undulating sound.
Borne from the flutes and lutes and viols
rare
Of wild-eyed minstrel women; wonder-
gowned
In robes of glimmering opal, how their hair
Tumbles, like moonlit waterfalls, around
Their gleaming limbs, whose swayings to
and fro
The tempo governs—swift in allegro
Or slowed to faint cadenzas, limpid, languor-
ous and low.
Here are the loves that once I loved, and
each
Appears to me in mid-love’s royal guise,
Flushed with a nuptial longing, and the
speech
Of Love’s inviting fluent in her eyes,
Ere dolorous surfeit, self-ashamed, impeach
Love’s swift unloosings of her own sweet
ties;
And here, as well, the glad loves yet to be
Stir fevers in the veins unceasingly,
To make the glimpsing Present swell the
Future’s amorous fee.
Here, too. the friends of other days declare
Their friendship as it was in days ago.
And yet again vvo drink, in vintage rare,
The old-time toasts, exulting as the glow
Of Youth’s bravura thrills us; here I bare
My body for the combat, here I throw
Glad challenge at the hostile Fates and
swing
Bude blow for blow, as loud the Vikings
Sing
Within my blood their battle songs and cheer
me, triumphing.
So is it swindling Fancy works her wiles
To cheat the bickering home, the greedy
mart.
The thing of dirty shifts and petty guiles
That fools call Life and live for: through
her art
She wins us to our own. and reconciles
The world of fact by Active worlds apart,
Where we may raise, to each his heart’s
desire.
Meet sanctuary and shrine and altar fire _
To Beauty’s goddess self, than whom none is
nor can be higher.

A Dog Fight.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE forthcoming tight between The
Dove, the old dog of Hobart Town,
and Fincher, the new dog from
Launceston, was talked of in the island for
weeks during the latter part of 1836. The
Launceston fancy lobbed into Hobart Town
two days before the fight, and fixed their
camp at the Plough and Harrow. There
were five of the party, the pannikin boss
of the crowd being a big, square-jawed Irish-
man, with the eyes of a ferret, and a broken
nose, who was known to the “crooks” as
“Flash Pat.” Before he was transported he
ran a dog-pit at Westminster, and he came
to the island with a reputation of being a
“leery cove,” who knew as much about the
training of fighting dogs as anyone.
For a year or more he had kept what he
called has “peepers skinned” for a bull-
terrier with “ginger.” but in the end he had
to breed one himself. He trained the pup,
taking care that the dogs the youngster fought
in his novitiate were mongrels that he could
master. By degrees Flash Pat set Pineher
to fight better-bred and tougher dogs.
Fincher put up a showing from the first, hav-
ing the ’nght fighting strain in him. Fat told
his pals that he felt sure that Pincher, young
and game till death, could “bate The Dove.
Pincher looked a likely dog, too, with his
strong jaw, well-developed chest, powerful
shoulders, light neck and strong loins. True
he had not The Dove’s experience, but the
young Tin was not without ring craftsman-
the challenge Pincher was described as
“a white bull-terrier, spotted with black,
weighing 59 pounds,” and the challenge was
“for the champion’s collar of Tasmania and
a side wager of 100 dollars, the entrance
money to the side of the ring to be divided
equally, the fight to take place a month from
the date of signing the articles.”
A notice was put up in the bar of the
Plough and Harrow, and it was well read by
convicts, sailors, and whalers. It ran :
THE CHAMPION’S LAST FIGHT.
The Old Dog, “THE DOVE,”
Gives Seven Pounds
To The Young Dog, “PINCHER,”
From Port Dalrymple.
Bred by “FLASH PAT.”
A rare evening's sport for the Fancy. Time and
Place from the licensee of the “Spotted Cow.”
When it was known in Hobart Town that
the sports from the Tamar had arrived with
Pincher, the bar of the Plough and Harrow
was crowded by those in the game who were
anxious to see' the hope of Port Dalrymple.
They liked Pincher’s quarters; the pitch of
his jaw ; the depth of his chest. The backers
of The Dove began to kick themselves. They
might have known, they reflected, that the
old bull-terrier’s teeth no longer had their
vyce-like grip, and that up against a young
dog, such as Pincher appeared to be, The
Dove hadn’t a “possible.”
The fight was arranged to take place in
the back yard of a wayside pub on the road
to Launceston, half a mile out of Hobart
Town. The fancy had to be fly as to who
got the office, as the Lieut.-Governor, Colonel
Arthur, had proscribed the sport in the
Colonial Times as “the pastime of idle
blackguards.”
When “Patch,” a Jew “fence,” the best-
known receiver of stolen goods in Hobart
Town, and owner of The Dove, with his
shadow, ail iron-haired ticket-of-leave man
named Bennie, went down to the trying-
out ground, aoout 50 of the fancy had already
ranged themselves around the ring, which
was about 10 feet square, with a skirting-
board, two feet high, forming the limit line
of the fight.
The arrival of The Dove was the occasion
of the mixed crowd straining their necks to
see if the old dog looked fit and well. He
followed his lead, made of strong leather,
ornamented with brass, looking as quiet as a
lamb. He bestowed a glance on and a sniff
at Pincher, and then wagged his stump of a
tail. He gave a half bark, half yawn, as he
looked up and smiled into the oily face of
Patch. '
“Mein tear poy, vas you tinkin’ tings?”
asked Patch, stooping down to pat the dog.
The Dove pushed his grey muzzle into the
Jew’s crook-like hands and licked some grains
of snuff off them. Not liking its taste the
dog cleaned his tongue on the lap of his chops.
“Te-he ! Te-he !” exclaimed Patch. “You
vas a funny dog, eh? Vas you saying you vas
not up to snuff, eh? Veil, veil! Vot about,
dis vonderful Pincher, eh ? I vas tinkin’
you vas frightened ob him. eh ?”
Patch stroked the head of the old dog; a
head as smooth as a clenched boxing-glove.
Flash Pat crossed over to look at The
Dove. He could not withhold his tribute
of admiration, though he qualified it, saying
to Patch —
“He’s a rale beauty, the sweetest dog I
ever see’d. It’s a pity in wan way to bate
him. I’m not the bhoy to crow down such a
dog, but we’ll bate him badly.”
“Stingaree Joe” was the master of the
ring, and Joe never looked better than when
he was a “judge” (he knew judges’ ways),
though he did get along with a limp sugges-
tive of the “chain step.” His black hair
was well oiled, and lay thickly parted in
the middle, on a shrewd-Cockney’s head. He
grew a heavy moustache above a Napoleonic
goatee, and his busy eyebrows were curled.
He was quite gay with a bright bird’s-eye
neckerchief, and a claret-colored waistcoat. On
his hands were two massive brass rings in
which were set agate stones, and they served
the purpose of knuckle-dusters to keep his
circle in harmony.
Joe blew a whistle. Patch and Flash Pat
led their dors into the ring, when Joe put.
up his hand for them to halt while he indi-
cated the conditions under which the fight
was to be fought.
Eight rules governed the fight, one of
which, the fifth, provided that “when the
dogs are not in holds the judge may at his
discretion from time to time allow the dogs
to be taken to their respective corners for
the space of two minutes to be sprayed—at
the expiration of this time the fight must be
at once resumed.”
An ill-conditioned, currish fellow, who had
been well served on his Appearance if
whipped, stood outside the ring, with a
bucket of vinegar and water.
Stingaree Joe, according to Rule 1, gave
the order for each dog to be ready to go out
to scratch.
Patch put The Dove into the ring at
his end: Flash Pat did the same with
Pincher at the opposite end. Both dogs
were then facing each other, ready for the
fight. Pincher was growling and straining
to get at The Dove, but his owner held him
with a tight grip. The Dove sat with his
eyes on Pincher. apparently easy in confi-
dence with Patch’s hand lightly on his head.
“Are you ready?” asked Joe.
As he asked Patch put his hand on the
loins of The Dove and the old dog rose with
a low growl and sprang ready to meet
Pincher, who was still straining at his lead,
looking for trouble.
“Let the dogs go !” cried Joe.
The crowd at the ringside gave a subdued
murmur. Patch and Joe stepped quickly
out of the ring.
The two dogs advanced, but with a differ-
ence which marked their methods of fighting.
Pincher shot forward with a headlong, swift
rush, which threatened to overwhelm the old
dog with sheer impetus of onset. The Dove,
on the other hand, moved as quietly as if he
were treading on eggs, with his weight held

THAT BAD BACK!
Don’t worry and complain about a bad back. Get rid of it!
Your back doesn’t ache without a cause, and often the cause is weak
kidneys. Perhaps hard work has put your kidneys a little out of
order, or a cold has settled there. In that case a medicine is
needed to help the weakened kidneys, and if it’s kidney backache
the chances are you’ll soon be over it. The lameness, stiffness, dull,
tired feeling, nervousness, dizziness, rheumatic pains and urinary
trouble should go too. Use DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY
PILLS. You can have faith in this medicine, as it is publicly
recommended by Sydney people.
Mrs. E. Mayhew, 29 Wyudham Street,
Alexandria, Sydney, says:—“l suffered from
backache and rheumatic pains all over my
body, and was sometimes so bad that I was
almost crippled. I could not stoop without
enduring torture; in fact, every movement
meant increased suffering, and I often used
to feel quite knocked out. To make matters
worse, my rest at night was disturbed, and
I was also subject to dizzy attacks. One
day a friend heard Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills very well spoken of, so she advised
me to try them. I bought a bottle without
delay and, after taking them for a few days,
my health began to improve, so I persevered,
and by the time 1 had used three bottles I
teas cured. The backache and rheumatic
pains have gone completely, and I feel
splendid in every way.”
Sydney
Proof
for
Sydney
People.
Mr. Robert Larcombe, Monumental
Mason, Lidcombe, Sydney, says:—"Off and
on for years I suffered agony from backache
and kidney trouble. I would go to bed feel-
ing fairly well, but on rising in the morning
my back would ache terribly. The pains
were sharp and' shooting and centred just
above the kidneys. The secretions were
also affected. 1 was advised to try Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and I sent for some
at once. After using the first couple of
bottles I felt better, and five bottles com-
pletely cured me. I can recommend Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills to all who suffer
with their kidneys, and feel sure they will
derive benefit from them.”
Five years later Mr. Larcombe says : —"lt
is over five years since Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills cured me of kidney trouble,
and I have had no return of the complaint
all that time.”

perfectly balanced and his nose pointing
straight at the rushing Pincher. Pincher
had often, in former fights, caught his oppo-
nent unprepared for his startling rush, and
had contrived to fasten on the other dog’s
throat before it quite kneAv what had hap-
pened.
This time Pincher met liis master at tac-
tics, for when he Avas almost on top of The
Dove, that wily old stager made a slight
bound to the left. So Avell timed and exact
\v as it that it seemed almost leisurely, and
as the impetus of Fincher’s Avas carrying
him past, The Dove banged his right shoulder
on to Fincher’s flank, and knocked him clean
off- his legs.
Turning quick as a flash The Dove made
for the prostrate Pincher, Avliose party yelled
with dismay to be soon quickly turned to
shouts of triumph Avhen their champion, with
a smart roll over, regained his feet, and
faced the oncoming of The Dove with almost
a veteran’s caution.
“Me dog’s a darlin’,” shouted Flash Pat.
“He’ll take some batin’.”
“Four ter vun on mein dog!” cried Patch.
There were a few instants of expectant
silence as tin l tAvo dogs circled slowly about
each other, The Dove moving his head and
neck from side to side with an undulating
motion.
“See the old dorg fiddlin’ with his ’ead ;
hain’t it pretty? The other dorg never knows
when Vs going to bite. He can’t see a bite
coining,” cried Bennie.
“Five to vun!” yelled Patch. “Ach, vill
no vun pick up monish? Acli, how vas your
dog likin’ dat?”
The question Avas the outcome of an in-
cautious movement by Pincher of his head.
The Dove took instant advantage of it and
struck at the left side of Fincher’s neck Avith
the celerity of a snake. Simultaneously it
seemed Pincher dodged, but too late. The
Dove missed the spot he had aimed at by a
fraction only and fastened on the top of the
shoulder, at the same time sharply swinging
himself to the right and out of the reach of
Fincher’s bite. The Dove tugged and pushed
Avitli the intention of again throwing the
young ’un off his feet.
The crowd roared.
Pincher braced himself on his legs. With
a turn of his head he grabbed fiercely at the
old dog, but OAving to the position The Dove
had Avith its jaw fastened on to Fincher’s
shoulder, and with his body almost in the
same line as Fincher’s, and The Dove’s tug-
ging and pulling away from Pinchers bite,
the young ’un Avas unable to muzzle on to
The Dove.
Their flying movements were so quick that
the pox-pitted crowd almost lost the dogs’
identities amidst the flurry of dust which
they tore up.
"Zee obit dog has no teeth,” shouted
Patch. “Eh? Eh? He has no teeth! Yot
a shoke!”
Pincher Avas displaying a pluck and en-
durance under difficulties which partly
buoyed up his backers. Surely The Dove
Avas tiring, while the other animal in the com-
bat of roughing and bollocking seemed
stronger than ever.
“He’ll never keep his grip,” they yelled;
“The Dove is done. The old beggar is
done!”
"’E hain’t, ’e hain’t,” cried Bennie.
“Wait, you , wait 1”
"Five to vun on mein dog!” shouted
Patch, his eyes glued on the bull-terrier’s.
There Avas no doubt of it. In this rough-
and-tumble sort of fight Fincher’s might,
Aveight and youth were telling, but The
Dove was still holding on as only lie could
hold, Avaiting for something to occur by which
he could improve his grip.
The dogs fell and rolled over for one
moment. Pincher Avas on his side with the
Dove on top. Quickly and quietly the old
dog shifted liis grip higher to the throat. He
relaxed his body, and put all his strength
into his jaws to hold on.
Pincher had no chance now of reaching the
old dog. The Dove’s grip prevented that,
and what could Fincher’s pluck and “ginger”
avail Avith his Avindpipe compressed? For
a few moments he put up a tremendous
struggle, whirling the old dog, unresisting,
about. Then, almost suffocated, Pincher fell
on his back, Avhile The Dove stood still,
holding his grip on the throat. He looked
as if he were waiting simply for the judge’s
verdict in his favor.
“The Dove -wins!” cried Stingaree Joe.
Patch and Pat Avent into the ring. The
old dog allowed Patch to choke him off
Pincher, and to replace his collar. Then
lie walked quietly back to his corner, Avhere
iie lay down panting and Avatcliing Flash
Pat’s efforts Avith water and vinegar to
revive liis property.

Ted Denny’s Treasure.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
nyro one at Peewee had heard of Ted
i Denny’s treasure till Ted recovered
from the long fever he contracted col-
lecting decomposed rabbits for John Hobson,
of the Buttercup run. Ted came up out of
his bed looking like the ghost of the earlier
Denny, a haunted man.
It was Denny’s never-to-be-shaken belief
that just before taking to his bed be had
hidden somewhere something of enormous
value, a vast treasure, some beautiful, desir-
able object the exact nature of which was
still unreAmaled.
Denny spent hours, sitting thinking, think-
ing till the sweat poured out of him, trying
to recollect Avhat it Avas he had hidden and
where he had hidden it. He grew no fatter,
his face remained haggard and grey. The
sheer effort of pursuing his delusion told on
him like violent physical exertion. He
always seemed just upon the point of grasp-
ing the alluring fact; illumination seemed
ever on the eve of bursting in his brain, but
always he missed, always the expected light
failed him.
Ted Denny had never had more than a
couple of pounds of his own. A five-pound note
to him had the aspect of awkward riches.
But Ted had been a consistent prospector in
the promising country about Peewee. and
eventually he fastened upon the belief that
the missing thing was a wonderful nugget
he had found somewhere about Buttercup.
The man who had been a useful standby
for farmers and others needing casual labor
became a restless, useless waster drifting
about seeking his hidden riches. To one
feature of his former life he remained true:
he was still attending chapel with monoto-
nous regularity; he still taught Class B in
the little Wesleyan Sunday-school at Peewee.
For months Ted kept his secret, but event-
ually knowledge of the mystery possessing
him leaked out, and after that the man’s
movements had always a peculiar interest to
his neighbors.
Peewme at the bottom of its heart believed
there avus something at the back of Ted
Denny’s obsession. Many affected levity,
and Ted met with much derision: but the
fact that perhaps, after all. Denny had hid-
den aAvay a great hunk of gold before the
fever took full hold and wiped the where-
abouts of his hoard from his memory, .caused
a lot of hard thinking in the district, and
digging for Denny’s treasure became a popu-
lar pastime that lasted at least a year.
Denny himself was seeking all this time,
like a puzzled hound on a broken scent. Dis-
jointed' scraps of memory flitted in his mind
like motes in a sunbeam. He clutched at
them, and they scuttled in eddies, leaving only
confusion. Then Denny sat down and cried.
The spectacle of Denny sitting in the bush,
weeping over a fresli-dug hole, a turned log
or an uprooted rock, became too familiar to
be recorded at Peewee.
Two and a half years had passed on that
summer’s Sunday morning when Ted Denny
sat in the middle of the packed congrega-
tion in the little hot chapel, while the Rev.
Abel Irons preached one of his most frothy
and fanatical sermons. Peewee Wesleyans
appreciated no sermon that was not fanati-
cal and frothy.
Suddenly Ted Denny jumped to his feet,
lie pointed a long arm. with a long hand
and a long finger, at the preacher. His
face was white as Death’s. His black eyes
blazed excitement.
“I know!” he yelled. “T remember.”
The preacher stopped; the congregation
swung round and stared at Ted Denny.
“I know Avhere I buried the treasure. 4 -’
said Ted. “It’s down by” . He said
no more, but turned, and, scrambling over
Brother Best's rheumatic feet, treading on
the toes of Sister Sarah Tregowan, he wal-
lowed across the congregation, fell into the
aisle, picked himself up and ran.
The faithful stared from the door to the
Rev. Abel Irons, and from the Rev. Abel to
the door, then breaking from all moral re-
straints, fighting and tumbling for the exit,
the congregation poured out of chapel and
followed Denny, who was heading for the
creek, with an old pick he had snatched
from the blacksmith’s scrapheap.
Denny went down under the pile bridge,
and dug- furiously. The congregation pressed
about him, staring with wide, expectant eyes.
For four minutes Denny dug by the third
pile, occasionally pawing Avith bis hands like
a rabbit hound.
A cry broke from the crowd. Denny had
recovered his treasure; it Avas precious
metal; lie held it in his trembling hands,
staring incredulously, still trying to think.
_ Two days before Ted Denny had taken to
his bed of the fever, John Hobson, of Butter-
cup. had been knocked on the head in the
darkness under cover of his own barn and
robbed of his most valuable portable pos-
session.
What Ted Denny noAV held aloft, regard-
ing Avith dull wonder, was, as all clearly
perceived, John Hobson’s gold Avatch!

“Indispensable”
—a word largely used in these days—may be said to accurately express,
in so far as any single word can, what is the careful and considered
conclusion which has been arrived at by many people who use
Beecham’s Pills. They consider that Beeeham’s Pills are ‘‘indispen-
sable” to their health, and, as a matter of course, to their happiness;
and they never allow themselves to be without a supply of this valuable
medicine in their homes. This latter is an excellent idea, and one
worthy of imitation for there is no doubt whatever, that, as a preven-
tive medicine —one that may be taken with confidence when perhaps
only an ‘‘out of sorts ” feeling is experienced and before any definite
ailment has developed—Beecham’s Pills are a positive boon. They do
good all round; - they tone up the stomach, correct the action of the
liver, regulate the bowels and are a powerful agent in purifying the
blood. It is certainly a good plan never to be without
