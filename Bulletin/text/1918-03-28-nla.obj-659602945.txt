Digger Verses
Old Mb. Lark.
Hay! ain’t the lurk a dinky bird,
The way the beggar sings t
Be dde&n't care a tinker’s cuss
For all the stuff Fritz flings.
He lives up in the trenches there,
He doesn't mind the noise;
He’s just a friendly little bloke —
Good cobbers with the boys.
And when the “ Minnies ” tioist and twirl,
And “ rumjars” bob and bust,
While “ five-point-nines” and, other “ fruit”
Stir up the bloomin’ dust,
It’s then I feels Fd like to be
Well up above sich things,
Like Mr. Lark, who kruncs what’s what,
And climbs upstairs and sings!
And when the dawn is rosy pink,
And I am standin’-to,
A-leanin ’ on the sandbags, ’cos
There’s nothinn else to do,
Old Mr. Lark he goes aloft
And trills his little song,
And somehow, while I listens there,
I feels me heart grow strong.
I takes a lesson from that bird:
The trenches ain’t so bad —
I feels I’ve been a thankless cove
To grouse and bite like mad!
I makes me mind up there and then
To take what Fate may bring,
Instead of cussin’ all the day,
Like Mr. Lark, I’ll sing.
C. It. Ayling.
Leave.
I want to stroll down Bond-street —
Lord, what memories it brings!
I want to see shop windows
Full of flimsy, useless things,
Rosy pink and pale blue mysteries —
You know the kind I mean.
(Are boudoir caps still in fashion?
Do they still wear crSpe de chine?)
I long for Piccadilly
And its crowds of lovely girls,
With their neat silk-stockinged ankles,
And their captivating curls,
With their thin, delicious blouses,
Dreams of silk and filmy net.
(Are pink nighties now in fashion?
Or is* it crepe Georgette?)
I dearly want to saunter
Along by Leicester Square,
And wateh with fascination
The many gay sights there.
Maybe I’ll see these visions
When next on leave I go,
And if I do, Old Thing, be sure,
rn write and let you know.
C. Baker.
The Ordnance.
Who are. the boys behind the line
Who get good food, including wine,
Who have no cause to grouse and whine?
The Ordnance!
Who are the men who dole out clothes
When not at work on curios,
And still get in their noonday doze?
The Ordnance!
At whom do neio chums laugh and grin
As they pass by in hats of tin,
Asking which of the leaves we’re in?
The Ordnance!
But don’t forget we fought the Turk,
And did our share in gallant work;
We fought disease, we fought the thirst
Of Anzac days—a thing accurst —
And didn’t come with the Thirty-first!

From “New Zealand a lie Front” (Cassell).
.fit
The lordly volume, New Zealand at
the Front, written and illustrated by
men of the M.L. Division (Cassell), deserves
a high place among trench publica-
tions. As illustrator, poet, story-writer and
humorist Harrimac, Billjim’s Maorfiland
brother, can hold his own with the Aussie, as
Harrimac terms Billjim. Owing to the diffi-
culties of publication and transport the
material for this characteristic and delightful
book had to be procured at short notice, pre-
cluding contributions from that considerable
section of crusading Diggers somewhere
around Jerusalem. The Maoriland language
is receiving some remarkable accessions from
this war: a necessary glossary is kindly pro-
vided —chiefly for the English civilian. The
training-ground is the bull-ring; the Dinks
is the term for that part of the M.L. Army
which rather fancies itself—a derivative of
dinkum. A cigarette of the commoner variety
is a gasper. Food, of course, is kai and a
potato reicai. Pakaru means broken,
smashed; poriro means “of unknown origin,
not in Debrett’s. The English form is used
as an expletive or term of endearment, as the
occasion demands.” Then there is the useful
Maori taihoa, “later on,” and the invaluable
plurry. “the great Australian adjective ex-
pressed in the more mellifluous language of
the Maori.” And there is the useful expres-
sion, stopping a blast, which means receiv-
ing a rebuke or something more cyclonic from
your superior in rank. The velocity of the
blast depends upon the state of your
superior’s liver.
There are excellent illustrations in color
by Thompson, E. F. Hiscocks, Finey, W. F.
Bell, and others; while in black-and-white
there is brilliant work by F. H. Cumber-
worth, G. P. Hanna, and a number of Digger
Bairnsfathers; while Finey is to be congratu-
lated for his numerous apt studies of the
Maoriland private. He has drawn the typi-
cal Maorilander without flattering him —a
nuggety bloke, muscular, hefty, phlegmatic,,
well-fed, ingenuous, cheerful and young, with
an obvious preference for his flat-brimmed,
[leaked, four-dgnted Mount Egmont hat.
The steel hat makes him look like any othter
bloke, and the Maorilander prefers to look
like himself, especially when there are any
Aussies about.
The letterpress is blithe and clever, but
hardly audacious; this Digger is only auda-
cious over the top, and even then he takes
his job verra seriously. This page likes the
conclusion of H. T. B. Drew’s yarn about a
Digger who revenged his cobber’s death by
stalking and bayoneting the German sniper.
“ ’Ere’s ’is cap and ’is badges,” he reported
on his return; then added, “’E groaned
lovely!”
What is Poetry ?
Henry Newbolt, in A New Study of English
Poetry (Constable, per Dymock’s Library,
145.), obliges with a definition of poetry.
Some of the preliminary questions he essays
to answer are: Is the essential part of
poetry the subject, the diction, the ver.silica-
tion or some peculiar quality ot emotion .
Is the highest poetry personal or impersonal,
subjective or objective, the product ot expen-
ence or invention .
Let’s begin at the beginning. . .
“Art, poetry, is common to the race ; it is
the natural activity of every man. . . Art is
simply expression: the act of the human
spirit seizing upon a sensation and giving
form to it.” But what is the use of poetry,
what is the pleasure or satisfaction derived
from it? This differs in the case_ of the
maker of poetry and the reader of it. The
poet’s object is expression, and having ex-
pressed himself perfectly he has his reward.
But the public come to the poet for some-
thing that will help them to a fuller life: ho
must excellently express feelings such as
they can understand and value. But the
poet has no end to seTve except his art itself.
(That is probably why poets usually have
to borrow traybits from the public.) But
the divorce is not absolute y for every man
looks beyond his life to a recreating of his
world; there are two worlds to which
every man simultaneously belongs, -his own
and the perfect world he longs for. And it
is here that the public reach over to the
poet: they find in the poet those pictures of
perfection of which they merely dream.
Poetry, then, is “the expression of the
aesthetic or intuitive activity”; the prosaic
is “the expression of the intellectual or logi-
cal activity of the fruman spirit.” “A work
of art in words is always poetry: a work of
science, in whatever form of words, would
always be prose.” So, in Newbolt’s logical
judgment, a good novel may be poetry, for
at bottom it is “a vast and complex intuition
amounting to a vision of a neiv world of
human life created by the novelist’s imagina-
tion.” But strictly poetry is always asso-
ciated with rhythm. And metre is not a
kind of decoration applied to poetry, as it
were,; externally, and to be judged by an
external standard. “The vast majority of
the well-educated have, in the very process
of their education, been impressed with the
belief that metre is an arrangement of lan-
guage which can be judged by the applica-
n a mechanical test, and that the poet
who produces a line which does not answer
to the test is a fit subject for correction by
SK
“ I* than we were - there is a public which
at the reviewer who
dec j ares tlmt a line ‘will not scan’ or that
con t a j n g a ‘trochee’ where it should have

reek 01 Jjatm tloctiea -
What is rhythm? The most significant
thing about rhythm is that it seems to be
always present where there is life. If
rhythm is of essence of vitality, if it
pulses through us like our blood, it is not
surprising that it should appear in human
speech, and especially in poetic speech, in
which we live most intensely. Poetry is in
its origin more akin to dancing than to song,
“Rhythm is before song.... The descent of
poetry is this: the rhythmic instinct of life
begot the movement of dancing: dancing
was accompanied and regulated by the beat-
ing of the measure in monotone: and this'
drum-rhythm was then impressed upon lan-
guage.” But a perfectly regular rhythm
could not be impressed upon language", Im-
cause language already had a rhythm of its
own, necessary to its meaning aiid therefore
persistent. In poetry, Newbolt boldly de-
dares, there is no such thing as perfect or
rigid rhythm. “What there has always
been is an antagonism, a balance, a compro-
mise, between the metrical ictus, the drum-
beat which I have imagined, £nd the com-
mon speech-rhythm of the language. Poetic
rhythm is, in short, neither strict mechanical
rhythm nor free speech-rhythm.” It is a
compromise. It is true that Tennyson
revelled in the regular mechanical hoof-beat;
but in more masculine verse it is compara-
tively rare. “Most of the beauty of The lines
and all their variety is gained by the skill
with which the woof of speech-rhythm is
continually thrown athwart the warp of
the metrical type. A master hand like
Swinburne’s will throw the shuttle 100 times
find produce no less than 50 different effects.
All but one of these are departures from the
strict type.”
Then why keep up the pretence? Why not
seek out the most beautiful natural speech-
rhytlim and use that, instead of pretending
to submit it to a metrical type? Newbolt
doesn’t know. His only answer is that there
must be some artificial restraint; though he
comes nearer to an answer when he adds
that without this restraint of verse-metre
the hearer loses the pleasure of rhythm,
“of having a certain expectation satisfied,
though it is never satiated.” The pattern of
regular beats is seldom actually present in
the verse but always existing in the memory
of the reader or hearer. Robert Bridges
asserts that the same thing was character-
istic of Greek and Latin poetry. The “quan-
tity” of which we hear so much from clas-
sical scholars, was, after all, an arbitrary
convention. “For both Greeks and Latins,
though they wrote by quantity, continued to
speak mainly, as we do, b jy stress; and
neither tried to arrange the words in the
line so that the speech-stress should coin-
cide precisely with the metrical ictus.” It
is exactly analogous to the warp-and-woof
effect in English blank verse. And on the
break-up of the Roman Empire the law of
quantity perished: only stress remained, the
stress of common speech.
J*
Rime was introduced into England by
Norman minstrels after the Conquest; but
the Anglo-Saxons have for centuries had a
prosody of their own, stress, with
alliteration added. The struggle between
the two systems lasted for centuries. It was
Coleridge who asked whether the hypocrisy
of pretending to conform strictly with metre
was worth keeping up: why not write solely
in stress prosody? But it was the present
Poet Laureate who first properly used this
principle of stress-verse. Newbolt quotes:—
When men lucre all asleep the snow came
flying
In large ivhite flakes falling on the city
brown;
Stealthily and perpetually settling and
loosely lying,
Hushing the latest traffic of the droiosy
town.
Deadening, muffling, stifling its murmurs
failing;
Lazily . and incessantly floating down and
down;
Silently sifting and veiling road, roof and
railings ;
Hiding difference, making unevenness even,
Into angles and crevices softly drifting and
sailing.
It will be seen that this stanza is built upon
the formula of five stresses —five natural
speech-stres :es—in each line. But stress verse
is not true to its name if it fails to stress
syllables that would be stressed in speech.
And here it is that Bridges fails —and New-
bolt neglects to catch the Laureate out. The
second line quoted above has six stresses, not
five. The stressed syllables are: large,
ivhite, flakes, fall-, cir, brown. So in the
seventh line there are also six stresses: si-, •.
sift-, veil-, road, roof, rail-. Apparently
Bridges decided to omit the stress respect-
ively upon white and roof; but in stress
verse that can’t be done. In other Bridges
examples quoted by Newbolt the same error
is apparent.
Newbolt justly asks for the- recognition of
two principles and their constant application
in judging poetry. Poetic rhythm is not an
applied ornament, the fit subject of a pedan-
tic criticism. And since poetry is a personal
expression, the natural tendency of poetic
rhj thm will be towards perpetual change.
And Newbolt believes that our modern poets
not only are determined to be no longer hin-
dered by old conventions of diction, of “scan-
ning,” of unnatural stress and ungrammati-
cal inversion, but that they p.re right in their
endeavor.
So, after a study of “Poetry and Person-
ality” and “Poetry and Politics”, we reach
this definition of Poetry: “Poetry is the ex-
pression in speech, more or less rhythmical,
of the aesthetic activity of the human spirit,
the creative activity by which the world is
presented to our consciousness. Good poetry
is not merely the expression of our intui-
tions. It is the masterly expression of rare,
complex and difficult states of consciousness;
and great poetry is the expression of our con-
sciousness of this world, tinged with man’s
universal longing for a world more perfect,
nearer to the heart’s desire.” Later on, New-
bolt adds that great poetry is also the mas-
terly expression “of intuitions in which the
highest thought is fused with simple percep-
tions, until both togetner become a new
emotion.” Hm ! Doesn't help us much....
And even then Newbolt makes the addendum
that though the artistic expression is for the
poet an end in itself, the making of a work
of art has a different motive; it implies an
audience. The poet who says: “I don’t care
whether people read my poems or not ; I
write for myself, and not for the public,” is
confusing two acts in one. His emotion vyas
his own, and expressed for his own satisfac-
tion ; but for whom did he write it, print it,
publish it and send it to be reviewed ?
Newbolt is amusing in his description of
the process by which a poet becomes a
classic. Usually he must wait for that
crowning distinction until he is quite dead ;
otherwise he might break out in some unex-
pected poetic direction and upset all the
critics. This Page has long held a similar
opinion. Our recipe for becoming a classic
may thus be expressed : Any fairly persistent
poet will become a major or minor classic
provided lie manages to keep alive long
enough. P>y the time he is 72 lie is for all
practical purposes dead, sufficiently dead,,
anyhow, to settle his place on the card-index
of fame. Of co rse, he mustn’t take any
risks of disappointing or surprising his pub-
lic by breaking, out in some new direction, by
allowing his brain to develop past his first
manner and method and outlook. The public
expects its popular poet to limit the line of
his development by his earliest successful
performance ; lie must continually repeat his.
subject and the treatment by which he made
his reputation. He must never peer out of
his pigeon-hole. If a persistent poet is care-
ful, by the time he is 72, he has become a
sort of literary legend ; he is too dead to have
anything new up his sleeve; he can be de-
pended upon to repeat himsfclf; his worst
verses will have been learnt by heart, and
hated, by every school-child of two genera-
tions; lbs “works” will have appeared in a
collected edition ; he will have got into all
the anthologies and all the Who's Whos: the
Melbourne laterary Cdub will have discussed
and settled him ; his birthday will annually
appear in the monthly paragraph in Tiib
Bulletin ; his obituary will be filed in every
newspaper “morgue”.; people will point out
his bald head at public luncheons of the
Millions Club; Norman Carter will have
painted bis portrait for the Gallery; George
Taylor will have published reminiscences of
him and himself in their bohemian youth;
nobody will read him, but everybody will have
heal’d of him ; and his most frayed quotations-
from his Collected Jobs will be misquoted in
the editorials of The Sydney Morning
Herald. . •
And when he die? —in his pigeon-hole—the
public, after having got over their impression
that he died years before, will proclaim him
a classic ; publishers who had always, and
rightly, shied from printing his unprofitable
poems, will rush to bring out an authorita-
tive edition ; Bertram Stevens will write his
biography, take up a subscription to bury
the old bloke, and insist upon the Federal
Government paying a pension to bis widow.
Anybody can do it if he only lives long
enough and obeys the rules.
J*
A New Study of English Poetry is highly
interesting. Newbolt has much to say about
Chaucer. Shakespeare, Milton, British Bal-
lads and Futurism in poetry; and he says it
brightly and well. :
»
The Nobel Prize for Literature has this
year been awarded to Denmark, apparently
as a sort of consolation prize, on the prin-
ciple that it is one of the few countries in
Europe that have hitherto escaped the honor.
The £BOOO w r as divided between Karl
Gjellerup and Hendik Pontoppidan, but the
latter refused his share, so that Gjellerup
mops up the lot. These two are the most
popular Danish novelists surviving from an
earlier generation. Pontoppidan is the lead-
ing living novelist of Denmark, almost a
local Balzac, but in the judgment of London
Times below the rank of the great names m
European fiction. After an enthusiasm for
English poetry, Gjellerup was seduced by
the seriousness of German Kultur, emigrated
to Saxony, married a German wife and has
been practically a German for the last oO
years. The Times suggests that it was not
his genius that induced the Nobel Com-
mittee to bracket his name with Pontoppidan
-—his warmest admirers would not rank him
with Anatole France or Thomas Hardy, and
there are in Danish literature several names
more eminent —but the fact that he is the
one Danish writer who is profoundly
fibsorbed by the spirit of Germany. If Aus-
tralia was a starter in the race, she was an
also-ran.
“Jim M.” : I noticed two queer things about your
bookshelf. Firstly it contains no work by Henry
Lawson! Secondly J. J. Hildef is the sole artist
represented! Surely The Art of Frednch McCubbm
is worth a place, for the splendid reproductions of
the poet-artist’s work, even if the letterpress i
weak. Why this thusness? ,
[Henry Lawson’s best books were published before
the inception of The Bulletin Bookshelf. And tne
shelf must contain' only the best work of am
Anzalian author. The shelf is a record of Anzangn
literature only since 1912. Hilder is the sole
represented in that period, because in this
judgment the volume devoted to his work ww tne
only book deserving of a place on the sneiu
McCubbin’s just missed; thus this thusness.J

| OVEN UNDERWEAR is one
j of the many commodities in every-
-day demand that have been
materially affected by war-time con-
ditions. Prices have already advanced
to such an extent that the tax on
the average purse has become
extremely heavy. And if indications
are not misread the upward tendency
in cost has not reached its limit.
Anthony Horderns’ policy at all
times is to pass on to patrons the
benefits accruing from advantageous
purchases, and not to seek for an
increase in price until higher costs
compel an advance.
The big stocks of Women’s and Child-
ren’s Underwear, in Wool, Wool and
Cotton, and Silk, ordered for last
Winter, but delivered quite recently,
were purchased at prices considerably
below to-day’s values in London,
America, and at the Continental sources
of supply; indeed, some of the makes
are to-day almost unobtainable.
Purchasing now the goods that were
bought under such favourable condition's '
is advice that discriminating people will
not overlook.
We reiterate the statement—
these goods could not be
duplicated to-day.

The Soldier.
He felt the dew upon his brow and wept
Till the salt tears along his cheek-wounds
crept.
He bit his lips and cursed the arching skies
Choked with his crying, but he could not rise.
“More men, more .men !” he heard the ser-
geant yell;
He strained up, moaning, but in torture fell,
And like a child he clawed the clammy earth
Helpless as dust from which lie had his birth.
“More men!” He shrieked, and with a
stinging pride
Felt for his rifle at his bleeding side.
The trigger slipped beneath his dying hand
And a strange mist seemed moving o’er the
land.
Cries of his comrades sounded far away;
The booming guns like billows of a bay
Roared through the murky madness of bis
mind,
A song of hate till all his heart was blind.
“Another man ! Another man !” he heard.
His filmy eyes in stony anguish stirred.
Teetli-clenched he screamed in triumphed
agony,
Rising at last upon his broken knee ;
And, drunk with torture of his Death’s
desire,
Died with his rifle rattling into fire.

Wise!
Only there in the sea of passion
We touched tne edge with our fearing feet,
Dipped and withdrew, and dipped again,
Bewaring joy just as much as pain
And dreading tides too fleet;
Stepped back where the cold grey shoreland
lies,
Then sought the sea with our longing eyes!
For it was so blue in the lilting weather.
And the sun seemed, rocked in it half asleep,
And the ripple voices conspired together
To cry, “Come forth where the tides are
deep.”
But we, alas! we had grown so wise,
We saw the foam where the black rock lies.
Inland now, in the level places,
I hear the wind in the swaying tree
And its minor note in the summer grasses,
I think of a moon-drawn flood that passes—
Till the wfind seems like the sea
And its salt wave touches my aching eyes.
lam sorry now that we were so wise!

The Kiss.
Whenas in fragrance, blossomwise,
Your fingers dream against my lips,
Out of a tired heart the longing slips
For charity into your dear, brown eyes.
There is it hid in faith, buried in sweet,
As in warm cloud the happy angel feet.
And from afar my own eyes watch your
mouth.
Grace o’ the noontide knows your eyes,
Sweet o’ the dusk your shadowed lips.
Bloom o’ the dawn your heart. In faery ships/
Rocked on old seas forgot, dim dreams
arise—
Old woes forgot grow gradually sweet —
Fade in your eyes, as fade bright qngel
feet.
And afar off, athirst, I watch your mouth.
Old midnights red ’neath darker skies
Cold Memory in her poison dips;
And from the tired heart in mercy strips
All the old pain and sin and dear, far lies;
Grey noon and ashen rose, all fades; more
fleet
Than angel smiles —than unseen angel
feet.i. .
All fades in tears, upon your mouth —-
your mouth.

All Christmas night upon the shelf,
Among the apples yellow-faced,

I thought of you, dear Dorothy!

I know not if my love be true;
But this I know, the sky is blue;
There’s still a butterfly or two
To coquette with the sun;
The gum-trees blowing greyly green
Against the hoyden clouds are seen,
The day is made for fun.
And oh, I’m merry with the mirth
That shakes the jocund, fruitful earth
And ripples through his Autumn girth
Into the dancing sea ;
The wine-fraught winds toss streaming hair
Across the eyes of haggard Care,
The world wags merrily.
I know not if my love be true —
An were he false why make to do?
Brown eyes speak just as sweet as blue
To every mother’s son;
And laughter and much merriment
By God into the woi’ld were sent —
Let’s drink our pint of fun.

CHANGING HORSES.
“Never change horses while crossing a stream,
especially if there isn’t a horse to change to.” —
Solomon Malaphof’s Booh of Wisdom. .
A hundred and five years ago the Great
Napoleon (not to be confused with the Small
Napoleon who came after him and in no
way resembled his illustrious alleged uncle
save in the shortage of his legs) travelled
to Moscow and back, and lost his army, his
greatness and his empire. Pie never got to
Petrograd or anywhere near it. But in
those days there were no electric telegraphs,
no telephones (there couldn’t be, for P.M.G.
Webster wasn’t born), no tramway sys-
tems, no long-range artillery, machine-guns,
magazine-rifles, dynamite or other high ex-
plosives, no railway trains or motor-cars to
hurry troops and supplies to the Front, no
airships to locate the enemy, no poison-gas
—in fact, everything was slow and primi-
tive. Under those conditions Moscow
became a name of terror, and the vast dis-
tances looked like an impregnable wall of
defence. Now the distances don’t count
for much, and if the Huns could spare
more troops from the French and Italian
Fronts it looks as if the occupation of
Russia’s two capitals would be a mere
promenade. There is some kind of a dis-
organised army in the way, but disorganised
armies count for little these days, especially
in a flat country, and more especially when
the Government behind them is flat and dis-
organised, too.
* * * *
Amid a welter of printed confusion and
a mass of tattered information a few facts
stand out. Russia had a revolution, and
it was a well-meaning upheaval with great
ideas about freedom and the rights of man.
The old autocrats and aristocrats were due
for extinction. Their system was old, cor-
rupt, brutal, ignorant, narrow-minded, short-
sighted, greedy and, as events proved, more
hollow than it looked. Still it was a fight-
ing force not to be despised, and when the
country was struggling for its existence
against a vastly superior enemy, and one
that was even more brutal than the old
tyranny, it- was a hazardous proceeding to
break the ancient machine without having a
new one to put in its place. Still the war
offered the new men what looked like a
chance, and they seized it. Apparently a
section of the “respectable” elements of the
nation gave it a measure of support, having
no idea of what would come after. Also
it seems that there was a rally of cranks
who are numerous in every country—Peace
Society folk, anti-conscriptionists, free sil-
ver men, bi-metallists, single-taxers, anar-
chists, communists, Seventh Day Adventists,
Freetraders, Fifth Monarchy men, believers
in the Beast of Revelation, passive resisters,
unlimited-paper currency men, the I.WAV.:
these or their local equivalents were natu-
rally all on deck. Then there were old
criminals released from gaol, new criminals
just starting business, released political
offenders with bitter grievances to avenge,
people who were thirsty (the Czardom hav-
ing recently cut off the drink supply), people
who were hungry and others. The ill-paid
and illiterate rank and file of the army had
the millennium offered to it in tons, and
the era of peace and brotherly love and pro-
found calm was lying around in .heaps for
anybody to pick up. There was so much
peace and calm that a great part of the
force simply laid down its guns, which the
Germans promptly picked up, and went
home. A great deal more was formally dis-
banded because, in the blessed prospective era
of love and happiness, an army would be
superfluous, and the Germans gathered up its
dropped gun also. The fact that a vast pro-
portion of the old officers were dead, or were
reduced to the ranks, or were fleeing for
their lives, or were in gaol, and that an
obscure ensign was now commander-in-chief
with suddenly elevated ex-privates as his
subordinates, facilitated these movements.
A Czar of the almighty variety might have
suppressed the revolution in its beginnings.
A weak Czar, who was so ill-served that he
was trotting peacefully back to his capital
in blank ignorance of the fact that he no
longer had a capital, had no chance.
* * * *
A feeble autocrat may reign all his days
unless an unprecedented brick strikes him,
and may die at last in his bed and in the
purple. His name, his ancestors, the old
bureaucratic machine and the old habit of
obedience all help to keep him going. A
revolutionary leader who has gone the whole
hog in uprooting the old arrangement of
things must make a complete new machine,
and he should have the brains and courage
of 20 ordinary Czars for the work. Also
when there is bitter war outside, and insur-
rection, mutiny, impecuniosity, disorganisa-
tion and secession within, he must be a man
of few scruples. He requires to be heavy
of hand and swift on his feet. Not having
tradition behind him, or force of ancient
habit, or the brutal and well-organised
bureaucracy, he must have ways of his own
for making it clear that whoever blasphemes
against the republic, or conspires against it,
or tries to secede from it, or is in any way
actively hostile to the brotherhood of man
might as, well have publicly put dynamite
under a Grand Duke in other days. And he
requires also to have ways of preventing
the new order being used too extensively as
a cloak for burglary, arson, private homicide,
forgery, bigamy, blackmail and other old
offences. A very strong man with a large
force of hefty and reliable subordinates of
his own selection may carry the undertaking
through. But with an almost overwhelming
foreign enemy at the gates, there is little
time to spare for mere theory, however
beautiful the theory may be.
* * * *
Apparently the Russian leaders sat too
much in offices, dreamed too many dreams,
and had too much faith in other people’s good
intentions. They had an idea that the German
—the boss tyrant and supreme liar of the
world —would be allowed to sympathise with
them because they had upset the Czar who
made war on Germany. They visioned that
the Hun bureaucracy would, on that same
account, preserve a semblance of kindliness
towards people who were even then calling
on the German masses to go and do like-
wise. The fact that the Chief Huns would
rather see their autocratic enemy back on
the throne than lend countenance to a
movement for dispensing with autocrats was
possibly beyond their well-meaning compre-
hension. Certainly they held out the hand
of fellowship to the Hun, and that person
looked at it with tolerance. He didn’t hasten
to take it, but he seemed to imply that it
wasn’t a bad sdrt of paw and was worthy
of consideration. While he waited, and did
as little as possible to scare the enemy into
a great rally for the national defence, the
Muscovite army to a great extent melted
away; discipline became a back number; the
empire fell to pieces through the secession
of one portion and another, which, amid con-
cealed Hun applause, and at concealed Hun
instigation, set up for themselves; the dis-
order grew apace because the two men who
sat so much in offices were unequal to the
occasion; and famine, which hadn’t been
far off before, stalked through the land
with long legs and seven-league boots,
for few people cared to sow when
there was such little chance of reaping.
The treasury at Petrograd became a blank,
for nobody save robbers collected much in
the way of taxes and there was very little
to collect in the Bolshevik part of Russia.
The public debt was repudiated, which made
small difference to anybody, for it was dead
already; yet formal repudiation was a silly
way of rubbing it in and a needless piece
of conversation. The Government paper be-
came of almost invisible importance. The
corridors of the official building, where Tkot-
sky and Lenin, the two chief theorists, sat
too much in offices, began to be unswept;
the bells got out of order; the office-boy
didn’t come at call; and the untidy Guards
on duty lolled at casual angles and spat into
the coal-scuttle. About this time the Hun put
a lump of ice and a dead serpent into the ex-
tended hand of fellowship and announced his
long-delayed terms. They were practically
the disbanding of the. remnant of the Russian
army; the indefinite —which means perma-
nent—occupation by the, Hun of much Rus-
sian territory ; the occupation of more terri-
tory if the Ilun feels inclined ; and a stu-
peudous indemnity. Then the Hun got a
hustle on and resumed the invasion.
* * * *
It has been rumored that one Russian boss
theorist wanted to accept the Hun terms or
any terms, while the other boss dreamer
didn't; but neither fact seems of much
account. Whether they were bought by Ilun
gold or whether they just happened to do
Hun service by accident matters very little.
All that matters is that Russia, with an ill-
administered and incompetent programme of
all-round friendship, appears to be worse off
than it was under no friendship at all. It is
New Australia on a stupendous scale, with
the handicaps of diverse languages and
nationalities, dense ignorance, a legacy of
evil traditions and a foreign war. Its
probable fate, unless the Allies are able
to save the situation, is the establish-
ment of a new Czar, a Ilun puppet ruling in
name over a mere fragment of the old domin-
ion ; and the restoration of the nefarious
and corrupt and ill-mannered bureaucrats,
with still more evil and uncivil German
bureaucrats over them, the bond between the
two gangs being their common wickedness.
When it was discovered that the defences of
Petrograd itself were crippled, German
agents having prigged the essential parts of
the guns right under the eyes of the kind-
hearted rulers, and despite their Guards and
their new police force, and their programme
and their ofiice-cleaner and their waste-paper
basket —when this was ascertained an addi-
tional gloom fell on the scene. The Trot-
sky crowd had been looking afar off at the
Regeneration of Man, and things had been
happening right between its feet.
WALLS.
Walls are the emblems of despotism.
Never yet has real liberty raised a great
building or erected a city of massive stone.
Such big works as have been created under
so-called democracy have always been carried
out by something within democracy which
was autocratic or despotic in character.
Ancient Home built magnificent palaces in
the days of the Empire and the foundations
of ruins show still more tremendous things
dating from the very early period of the
kings; but the buildings constructed during
the stalwart period of the Republic were
for the most part ordinary or even insig-
nificant. There was a terrific building boom
in Jerusalem under the despotism of Solo-
mon, and a still bigger one under the abso-
lute rule of Herod the Great; but the
comparatively free Israel of the days when
only a High Priest was in power did little
beyond mending the holes in the city wall
and erecting a makeshift temple which was
but a shadow of the magnificent one that
had gone before. The sky-scraper of New
York, too, marks the rise of the despotism
of the trusts; for the real buildings of free
America are the log hut in the forest and
the shack on the mountain slopes of the
West. Not only are walls the emblems of
despotic rule, but the comparative thick-
ness and savage strength of them are an
indication of the extent and nature of the
evil thing. In England the Norman built
tremendous fortresses of stone, into which he
crowded with horse and herd and man-at-
arms and knight and dainty lady, until the
stench of his castle rose in a defiant blast
to Heaven, proclaiming the might of the
splendid noble who could endure all that
reek. In Scotland, on the other hand, a
simple tower was regarded as sufficient for
defence; and the horses and cows and sew-
age and the bulk of the retainers stayed
outside. And Scotland was just as much
freer than England during the Middle Ages
as such a comparison of walls would indi-
cate. When the Paris revolutionary mob
rose in its fury of despair and pulled the
front out of the Bastile, it was led by sure
instinct. The place where the walls were
thickest was exactly the place where des-
potism was most firmly entrenched.
* * * *
As our so-called civilisation has grown
the nature of the'walls has changed. No
longer does the massive fortress of stone
frown over the edge of the precipice to
strike terror into the hearts of the valley
dwellers below; but a multiplicity of walls
has taken the place of the ancient structures,
and the crowded suburbs of endless brick
and the packed and blackened factories
shout against the liberties of man in exactly
the tones of the older castle. It may be
that walls to some extent are necessary;
but even the walls of the cottage in its green
garden speak too much of the despotism of
custom. Where the free air should enter
there is only a small window, and the doors
are §hut tight against the possible in-
truder. It is all a legacy of the past.
The proverb which declared “an English-
man’s house is his castle” carried down the
idea from the day when Plantagenet knights
lived in stone vaults and protected them-
selves when they rode abroad with walls of
steel armor. The alleged freedom of
England has largely been an extension
of the privilege of erecting walls to
an ever-widening circle of self-imprisoned
citizens. Every wall, like every barred
door, stands for distrust, for want of faith
in the inherent decency of the race of man.
Much modern wall-building is, of course,
merely formal and intended by the unimagi-
native builders to be in some way decora-
tive ; but even extensive decoration of the
kind has an imprisoning effect. The street
with its pride of carved stones shuts out the
good sun and casts a shadow of some sort
upon every heart within it. Trees, open
spaces, waving flowers, the fair view to the
sea, large gardens about low walls—these
are the things that speak always of free-
dom. But the city must always have in it
the elements of despotism, and the higher
and closer its buildings the more that des-
potism grips. Even if the buildings soar
to meet the alleged conveniences of trade
and commerce, those conveniences ?-*. them-
selves despotic. The by-law of life which
insists upon a man going up and down in a
lift is as arbitrary as the force of an auto-
cratic empire that compels a man to fight
for a cause he hates. Freedom must mean
personal liberty of action ; and there is no
such liberty when a brick wall is three feet
from the elbow and the nearest green and
growing thing half a mile away.
* * * *
The movements for the liberation of man
mast be movements for the tearing down of
walls. The world’s needs are chiefly air and
sunshine—mental and moral as well as
natural. The Romans, like the Chinese,
built vast walls across great sweeps of coun-
try to keep back the enemy on the other
side; and though, in a physical sense, such
breaks are not used to-daJ% the arbitrary poli-
tical boundaries of States are just as really
walls as if they were of stone. In point of
fact, the dividing walls of Europe are the
cause of the present war. The balance of
power, the greed of territorial expansion and
a hundred other things all intimately con-
nected with such walls have been the excuse
or explanation of most of the blood shed in.
a thousand years of battle. To smash dowri*
such walls and smash them down forever
should be the object of the Allied nations.
Boundaries for administration there must
be. but boundaries for national glory and
imperial pride are not worth the loss of one
human life. Once break down the wall which
purely artificial systems have created and
mankind can breathe freely. A Frenchman
does not reallv hate a German as a man, nor
has a Bulgarian any fixed desire to slaughter
a Roumanian. The national quarrels are
in every case quarrels over boundaries or
legacies from previous quarrels about boun-
daries. Let the peoples be brought face to
face, into kindly touch with one anpther, and
all their antipathy is no more than the
rivalry of adjacent parishes. Behind the
wall the foe seems an unpleasant person, but
met in the open fields —often even in the open
fields of battle —he is a good sort with
laughter on his tongue and an honest desire
to be friendly. And all this liberation of
man from the shadow and curse of walls is a
comparatively easy matter. With good local
government and a loose universal federation
of peoples for police purposes there is no
reason why any nolitical wall which cannot
be easily stepped over by the least agile
citizen should exist at all. An old Scripture
advises us not to despise the day of small
things ; and the future would certainly seem
to be with the territorially small things. But
because those small things may be real things
they are in the best sense the great things.
Empires like the one which has just fallen
in Russia, and like those that are tottering
in Austria and Germany, have never been
great things because they never had a foun-
dation of reality. Let the walls come down.
There will still be sunshine and good air
despite all the graves and the pollution of
the Ion? and bitter war.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
What Denison Miller Didn’t Say.
Thus Denison Miller. Governor of the
Commonwealth Bank, giving, as in duty
bound, a leg-up to the War Loan: —
Australia is at present enjoying an exceptionally
prosperous period, as high prices are being received
for our primary products, many of which have,
through the liberality of the British Government,
been paid for though they have not yet been shipped.
The moneys which have been received in this way
percolate through the primary producers to all classes
of the community, with the result that the Aus-
tralian public now have as much, if not more, money
at their disposal than at any time in our history.
Had it not been for the advantageous arrangements
made with the British Government regarding the pay-
ment for our products, the financial position in Aus-
Easter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Blessed the dead who, fighting, die
Victorious in the blood and mire,
In faith that the triumphant cry
Of life new-born comes from the fire:
Life that shall mould the world afresh!
What though tornadoes round them roll
And thunders burst their quaking fiesh!
They die with undivided soul,
Blessed are they and doubly blest!
No troubled dreams shall rend the mind
That sees upon the good world’s breast
Evil in one gross shape confined,
And seeing, strikes, and, striking, falls.
’Twas thus the happy warriors passed,
Believing Hell’s embattled walls
Fell at their final trumpet-blast.
O sacred dead in lands apart!
How can we hope to catch your glow
Who watch with a divided heart
The changing tides of battle flow?
Who see the foe in friendly guise,
And tremble at the flames that seem
Unguessed from secret pits to rise
And waste the cities of our dream?
The sky is dark with sombre wings,
And danger lurks behind, before;
To-day’s half-vanquished evil springs
To life behind to-morrow’s door.
E’en friendship wears a double face!
Only the simple heart made blind
Can turn his back on the loved place,
And front his foe with single mind.
Yet it was well with Him who paid
The price on sad Golgotha’s hill,
Seeing the powers of darkness fade,
And a new world redeemed from ill.
Not less with those who feel, in truth.
Though the red sky rain fiery sleet,
That, through their hour of anguish, youth
Shall walk the world with careless feet.
Those, too, who in a reckless hour
The paths of dark rebellion trod.
No deep disquiet made them cower
That dawn before the firing-squad.
The quicklime eats their valiant dust,
But what shall stone or steel avail
Against their bright, immortal trust
In the white hosts of Innisfail!
BlessM are they who lie in death !
Life has no deeper boon to give
Than faith that sacrificial breath
Shall make the Tree of Freedom live.
Haply afar with hearts made wise
They taste, in truth, the goodly fruit,
Where we but see with troubled eyes
The blasted trunk and blackened root.
VICTORIA.
VANCE PALMER.


tralia to-day would have been very different, as it
would have been most difficult to obtain a market for
our goods at any price at all.
That was what Denison Miller said, being
true to liis salt and anxious to meet the new
loan with a brave countenance. But how if
Denison Miller had said this? —
Every great loan boom, whether it be for war—
provided the war isn’t devastating our own country
—for good public works, for rotten public works or
for sheer robbery and corruption, puts a hectic beer-
flush on the face, and especially the nose, of the
community while it lasts. The Mississippi Scheme
and the South, Sea Bubble did the same in their day.
A vast new currency of notes and bonds keeps things
on the move for a time.
Through sheer mismanagement and incapacity on
the part of our rulers, however, we haven’t had the
share of artificial prosperity that might be expected.
W'e sold enormous quantities of wheat to the
British Government at a low price. For a first-class
sample the farmer averages (in time) about 3s. 6d.
to 3s. 9d. per bushel net. Even the farmer with
capital, good machinery, industry and intelligence is
hardly making a crust at the game. Also, the crust
is in arrears. About 8,000,000 tons of wheat are
decaying on our hands because we can’t get it away,
badly as Britain needs it. Our imbecile Government
refuses even to run up wooden sailing-ships to do
the carriage; it only appoints new officials, builds
silos (with a smell about them), and wrangles with
trades unions.
There is a great fear that the British Govern-
ment will no longer provide our farmer with the dole
on which he barely lives, being tired of decayed
wheat that is out of his reach. In that case, unless
we find ships, the grower may write “Finis” or
“Iciubod” on his fence and quit. A great deal of
the wheat that has been paid for is too far gone for
acceptance in England. Thanks to these varied
alarms the cultivated area is diminishing and agri-
culturists are already getting out.
What makes the wheat-man gnash hardest is the
knowledge that his product is worth over 10s. per
bushel in the United States, if he had any kind of
cheap tub to take it there.
The rabbit promises soon to be a big loss to the
country instead of a profit. The custom has been to
freeze bunny and export him, and the British Govern-
ment has bought large quantities. Now it says that
as it can’t get delivery the animal will have to
remain here and run about the paddocks and multiply.
The production of rare metals has greatly fallen
away, and many mines have been closed. Rare
metals are little used in Australia, and it is difficult
to export them, as they can’t swim. Besides, the ex-
port prices have been fixed by authority and fixed so
low that great bitterness has resulted.
The shipbuilding industry has almost ceased,
despite the extreme need for ships. You could hardly
find a trace of it with a bloodhound.
Manufacturing industries, taken as a whole, find
employment for fewer people than they did some
time ago—this despite the demand for munitions.
Some people say the utterly idiotic tariff is responsi-
ble. Banks are doing well, partly because the
stupendous loan flotations bring a lot of miscel-
laneous business. There is a dreadful row about
waste in the War Department, and people say that
it is the last possibility in the way of an ass, but
even waste keeps loan money in circulation. Strikes
are more numerous than usual. The Government
pays almost all the war expenditure, including waste,
out of loans in order to obviate taxation. A number
of old loans are falling due and being renewed at
very high interest, but that is mostly a matter for
posterity. I would be darned sorry if I were pos-
terity. Any man who is his own son these days is
taking risks.
If the Ministry hadn’t been so fond of touching
the paint to see if it was dry; if it had known when
to keep still; if it hadn’t worn out its singing voice
with so much public eloquence and hadn’t been so
like the old-time Jacobite conspiracy, where one man
in every 12 was a disguised enemy and the other
11 all talked at once—if it had left a few things
alone and shown some brains about a few other
things, affairs would have been better. For instance,
if it had found ships, first and foremost and all the
time, the people could have sold a heap more goods
at much higher prices. Instead, it was so busy
supervising that a cow could hardly lean over a
fence without being properly stamped.
Personally I think that the Federal Cabinet is kin
to the Bourbons —it learns nothing and it forgets
nothing, and it didn’t know much to begin with.
But as it is my employer, in a sense, I wouldn’t
mention this for the world. Often when it comes
back in its motor-car tired and hot after officially
opening a new hen-farm at AVarwick, with oratory and
lunch, I feel inclined to ask it where it expects
everything t.o go to, when the loan boom is over, but
I forbear. I am not one to tread on even the most
incompetent of my fellow-creatures.
That was what Denison Miller didn’t say.
What a joy it would have been if he had
said it! Perhaps he thought itl

Imported Vegetables.
In mentioning the other morning that the
price of tobacco was being increased, Sydney
Telegraph casually remarked that, as local
tobacco growing had not met with much
success, “leaf for making up cut and plug
tobacco and cigarettes has to be imported.”
As all this seemed to accord with its well-
known principles of Freetrade and to imply
that local products, whatever their nature,
are poor stuff; anyhow, the Telegraph pro-
bably felt very gleeful for the rest of the
day. But to The Bulletin the statement
that tobacco “has to be imported” sounds
like rank perjury. The fact that tobacco is
imported is no reason why it should be. The
circumstance is merely a continual reminder
of the gross public extravagance of Aus-
tralia and of what happens in a country that
borrows its way to greatness. The Com-
monwealth is the only country on earth
having sub-tropical territory which despises
its own smokes and fails to make tobacco-
growing a source of national wealth. It is
worse than a scandal that this should be so.
But as long as public policy is devoted to
borrowing, nothing else can happen. There
is evidence that tobacco-leaf of the finest
quality can be grown here. Yet the latest
figures show an importation of 0614 tons of
manufactured and unmanufactured smoking
material, valued preliminarily at £898,8
and. after the tax had been adjusted, at
£2,225,37(>. • Apparently in 1915 101 b. of im-
ported tobacco was used up in the factories
for every lib. of the local product, and the
position now is very much worse. Thus
nearly a million is being sent out of the.
country each year for leaves of a plant that
we can grow ourselves; over two mil-
lions of revenue is taken on it by the (lov-
ernment, which represents wealth created by
growing something else or omitting to pay
some of the bills; and people _ who ought
to be making a living by growing tobacco
are not doing it. There seem to be about 15
tobacconist shops in every street, there are
3547 persons working at 34 factories—and
apparently nobody cares 2d. that the whole
business, instead of being one that brings
the Commonwealth some definite economic
return, is really a national loser. The day
is not very far off when Australia will have
to stop this leak and several others, and get
down to business like other people.
A Railway Commissioner’s Job.
Several highly-recommended candidates for
the job of making the Victorian railways pay
are announced from the U.S.A., so presum-
ably the unfortunate Person Who Speaks
Through His Nose will soon be here with a
shiny grip and a heart full of hope. Then
disillusionment will come thick and fast upon
him. He will find*: —
(1) That he can’t shut up hopelessly unprofitable
branch lines if political influence is in the way, for
it isn’t good business to antagonise the local voter
even if he be poor and scarce.
(2) That he can’t prevent hopeless new lines being
foisted on him to be “made pay,’’ no matter how
clearly he may demonstrate their hopelessness, if
political considerations require them.
(3) That he can’t seriously reduce wages, because
the trades-union vote would be antagonised to the
damage of political institutions.
(4) That he can’t materially raise freights and
fares without antagonising the farming vote, which
would be a political disaster.
Likewise and furthermore :—•
(5) If he points out that with a few short connec-
tions he could open up a far better port than Mel-
bourne, in an almost empty country, and could
thereby give Portland a start that would make it
another Melbourne, and might thus add 20 or 30 per
cent, to his earnings, he will be told that political
principles forbid there being any big place except
Melbourne.
(6) He will And that if a 3* per cent, railway
loan falls due and has to be renewed at 6 per cent.,
he must shoulder the new burden, and mustn't even
swear for fear of disturbing the political system.
(7) If he tries to economise by making his engines
drag a double load, the resulting smash, as in Tait’s
time, will disturb the political calm.
(8) If he asks whether the lines are or are not
a goldarned implement of corruption for buying votes,
he will be informed that the high political traditions
of the State preclude such an assumption.
(9) And if He Who Speaks Through That Which
He Smells With inquires why, in these conditions, he
was brought to Victoria at all, he will be informed
that he was brought as a matter of political policy
to make the railways pay.
If he dies of an apoplectic fit just here
the doctors won’t have the courage to certify
that political confusion killed him. They
will sooner attest that improper feeding in
infancy rushed him to his untimely sepulchre.
o
“Silence in the Court” —and
Everywhere Else.
An Australian military officer who robbed
the Defence Department of thousands—part
of the scheme was the regular drawing of
pay for a regiment that didn’t exist —and
had a gay time on the proceeds, finished up
with four years’ hard labor. Subsequent in-
quiries disclosed that good reason existed for
supposing that this officer had got away with
considerably more plunder and had, com-
mitted more numerous offences than were
mentioned in the indictment at his trial. This
was clearly within the knowledge of the De-
partment, because it transpires (vide the lat-
est report of the Commission) that the Prime
Minister, “having regard to representations
of the father and the gallant war services
rendered by the brothers of the accused,”
directed that no further proceedings be taken
against him. The Commissioners consider
that this incident is “inexplicable” and point
out that the result of abandoning further
prosecution was to prevent the following-up
of investigations which might have deter-
mined whether grave suspicions concerning
other officers were justifiable. The view of
Solicitor-General Garran is that the prose-
cution went quite far enough in securing one
conviction, as, even if guilt had been proved
on other charges, the punishment would have
been a concurrent sentence. Now, the ques-
tion is not whether a person who had robbed
the people of £67,000 would have been told
to stay in gaol for more than four years if
he had been proved guilty of other crimes.
This paper could derive no satisfaction from
seeing an alleged criminal pursued to the
bitter end. The point is whether the reason
given for not prosecuting is genuine. Or did
the Minister joyfully seize upon the quite
legitimate representations of a hard-hit
father as an excuse for obscuring further
view of the rottenness of the Department?
The trial of this man was horribly damaging
to Pearce. Just about that time, too.
Pearce was asserting that his department
was going like a well-oiled machine and
struggling to gag The Bulletin when it
asserted that, instead, it was floundering
in chaos. Nothing will make this paper now
believe that the fear of further horrors com-
ing to light had not great weight in causing
the Government to temper justice with
mercy. If this forger had been detected
throwing eggs' in Bananaland or lurking in
the vicinity of the I.WAY. it is long odds
that the facts would have been put before
the jury. Justice may be blind, but can
usually pick a shady place in which to sit
and have a sleep.
The Value of Congestion.
The new State Governor of N. S. Wales has
remarked that Balmain is “worth more than
five bob.” It is true that Dr. Balmain
paid almost as much as that for the place
many years ago; but it was then sweet,
clean and wholesome. At present the sub-
urb has grime upon its face and may quite
easily be in the future, as the Governor sug-
gested, “the greatest hive of industry 'south
of the equator.” But that doesn’t prove
that it is worth five bob: nor does the fact
that five bob wouldn’t buy an inch of its
worst uncleanness. Very many things sell
very readily for a lot more than they are
worth. The whole question turns upon the
value to Australia of congesting an ever-
increasing hive of toil at such a spot; and,
on all the indications, to do so would be a
definite loss both morally and economically
to the continent. Wide open spaces, where
the nominal value of the ground is still five
bob, or something like it, are waiting to be-
come industrial centres; and the spread of
population which their development would
cause means prosperity for the Common-
wealth and cash in the pockets of the Aus-
tralian people. It is, of course, quite natu-
ral that a Governor who has been accus-
tomed to associate great industry with black
and reeking horrors like those of Manchester
and Birmingham should take off his hat and
shout when lie sees the grime getting into the
souls of the dwellers in Balmain. To him
that grime looks like progress. But it is
not progress of the sort Australia needs. To
concentrate more factories around a city
that is already suffering so greatly from
congestion that the disease in its secondary
symptoms is affecting even our armies abroad
and our ballot-boxes at home is ruinously
expensive; and far from a Balmain of the
kind indicated / in the Governor’s speech
being worth five bob to us, it would pro-
bably represent a tremendous debit in the
nation’s books. Somebody would make
money out of it, but the loss to the public
would be calamitous.
—
Motherhood —or What?
Dear Bulletin, —It seems a bit of bad
luck for Professor Berry, the Methodist
Conference and men in general that, after
promising to present the woman’s side of the
case, “Lysistrata” (B. 21/3/T8) forgot
all about the matter. What is her side of
the case? I wish she would get down to
bedrock and show us where the moral dis-
tinction is between the abortion she deplores
and the prevention she encourages, and what
the difference consists of Meanwhile it is
just cant for a woman to try to justify
evasion on her own part by (1) explaining
that a degenerate woman of the century
before last brought a long line of criminal
wastrels into being, and (2) by putting for-
ward the grotesque demurrer that the Com-
monwealth fiver is handed over to “anything
resembling a baby.” It is easy enough to
understand a woman having a quarrel with
existing relations between the sexes. These
are in many ways barbarous and immoral.
But there are not many men outside of a
mental clinic who will quite understand the
significance of a document in which a
woman, believing herself to be talking about
maternity, puts the greatest emphasis upon
something which she considers forbids to
woman the satisfaction of what she regards
as “an indisputably legitimate appetite.” The
maternal instinct is one thing. The appetite
she is thinking about is something else.
Unless the case against motherhood, or in
favor of keeping the maternal instinct within
certain boundaries, turns upon establishing
the high ethical place of concubinage and
the physiological advantages to woman of
unrestricted indulgence in nervous excita-
tion, “Lysistrata” should come to her
point, quickly, and be done with it. She
put an arresting question: “Is there any
other sound reason in the whole wide world
for having children at all except one wants
them?” The certain answer to this is “No” ;
but neither question nor answer has relevant
place in “Lysistrata’s” thesis. The ques-
tion that is really cogent and goes to the
root of the whole business, morally and
physically, is this: “Is there any reason in
the whole wide world why a woman should
mate with a man unless she wants children?”
Of course this question of the size of the
family is in the main a weariness—the sub-
ject of a disputation as disordered as the
bowels of a dyspeptic. It can be answered
in the terms dictated by the environment,
vitality, vanity and moral notions of each
individual, and the sum of these answers is
going to reflect the practices of society, for
good or evil. But behind all this is the cer-
tainty that the practices of society must
profoundly affect the nation. It is issuing
a challenge to the eternal gods to live in the
belief that a nation whose womanhood de-
clines maternity can handle the job in front
of Australians. Women omit the child and
men second the resolution because they do
not want children ? Bubbisli! They do it
because the State penalises father and
mother for every child they produce. It
is not necessary to be a very expert logician
to make out a better case against this than
“Lysistrata” establishes for restraining the
functions of the female organism. Nor need
one be a member of the Methodist Confer-
ence to have at least some doubts about
whether a few people sprinkled over a mighty
continent are going on the right lines when
they reckon children are no use or in the
road or something. “Lysistrata” intro-
duces some inappropriate remarks by Foret.
If she would read what Havelock Ellis
has been saying lately about the subject she
intended to handle, she perhaps might see
that there is a side to it other than the one
she notices, that problems of psychology and
economics are strangely mixed up in it, and
that at least one very competent observer
and philosopher can write about motherhood
without thinking of prostitution. Popular
views about chastity have undergone some
strange convolutions since the Roman
matron lived and died. Ideas about vice
seem to be keeping them company.—Yours,
Quill.
The Attack on Billjim.
“Bill Badd” : London at the-, present time
is the happy hunting-ground of women, and
the profession is open to any old plague-
carrier that hapnens along. Frenchwomen,
barred by their own Government, are given
free rein and allowed to become prolific
sources of infection, and. by the natural pro-
cess of dissemination, non-professionals are
beginning to suffer. The need for control is
urgent. The reported attempt of the Ituns
to introduce germ's of disease by means of
infected sweets produced a horrified gasp;
but the connivance of our own authorities in
the spread of venereal disease doesn’t raise
a protest. That facilities for treatment are
provided after the revival of the trouble is a
poor substitute for keeping it off the premises
altogether. The alternative to Miss Rout’s
suggestion—the license, with compulsory
periodical examination, and effective dis-
couragement of unlicensed practitioners—is
obvious; but if you do that you '‘counte-
nance immorality.” Morality isn’t the average
politician’s long suit; but the wowser vote
and influence is not a thing to be lightly
jeopardised. So the quantity of venereal
disease passed to Billjim becomes merely
“a matter for sincere regret.” It must be a
weird mental habit that induces “right-think-
ing people” to believe that any amount of
misery inflicted on innocent and guilty alike
—on children especially—is preferable to a
remedy that might be construed into appro-
val of “sin.” It isn’t only Billjim abroad
who needs protection. In one house in Carl-
ton (Vic.) there are six women known to be
diseased, and all quite at liberty to entertain
a lonely soldier on leave. When he becomes
a temporary casualty the Government does
its duty; but that is much too late.
Horse Breeding as It Isn’t.
By a man who has grown up in the stock-
raising business: —
One of the things that most make me tired is
the advice reiterated by Government departments and
bucolic newspapers to get busy horse-breeding “for
the good of the country.”
What the advocates of horse-breeding—invariably
people who breed nothing but inkmarks themselves
—have never seen is that the vital condition of
successful horse-breeding is some means by which
£OO per head should be guaranteeable for all horses
fit for military purposes at four years of age. And
with the average of horses at that figure there are a
good many of us who would still prefer to stand off
them.
At the very lowest estimate one horse takes as
much keeping as 12 sheep. In. fact, if you stocked a
clean “new” paddock at that rate exclusively with
horses you would find them .dying out “on a face”
after the third year. Now 12 sheep in many parts
of the country are returning £lB per annum at pre-
sent values; but we will put their returns at £1 per
head per annum. This return usually comes in two
instalments; in other words, we have to wait only
six months for our first return. To get a return
from breeding a horse we have to keep its mother, on
an average, two years and the horse itself four years.
In those six years the 12 sheep would have returned
£72, not to speak of the interest on the first five
yearly returns. From the £6O returned by that
(imaginary) horse we have to deduct at least £5
for the service of its sire. (We never see more than
a 50 per cent, return of horses sold for services
paid for.) To this must be added interest on that
£5 for five years and £l 10s. for breaking in, or, at
compound interest, say, £7 out of our (imaginary)
£6O, leaving an imaginary return of £53 as against
a real return of £72 from our sheep. But in place
of this imaginary £53 put the much more likely
actual average of £2O (and how few get that much
year by year!), you will have a pretty fair idea of
what breeding horses “for the good of the country”
really means.
The only intelligent answer that can be given to
this presentation of the case is: “There is a great
deal of good country unsuited for sheep while highly
suitable for horses.” To that answer there are two
rejoinders: (1) There are classes of sheep suitable for
all classes of country; (2) on good country suitable
for a horse one can put five good weaners (cattle)
purchasable at £6 per head, and saleable at £l2 in
12 months; or, say, £lO, to make the horse’s case
a bit better. Now 5 £4’s £2O; 6 £2o’s = £l2O, as
against an imaginary £53, or an actual £2O of horse-
money. Is the neddy in it?
And.the quickness of the return from sheep, and
even cattle, contrasts just as vividly with the length
of the wait for the dividend from the “nobler”
animal.
In fact, the more angles one looks at the subject
from the more convinced does he become that the
horse can only be bred as an expensive hobby, with
only the most fantastic hope of a profit to lure one on.
The ordinary horse-breeder never sits determinedly
down with a butt of pencil and the top of a kerosene-
case to figure the business out to the very bitter
end; but just goes it blind —usually because he
happens to have mares that were originally too faulty
to sell and are now too old to work.
In the iron times ahead, when things tighten up to
bursting-point—as they will—we shall see the horse
ever more recognised as the unprofitable member, and
relegated to oblivion, in favor of ever-improving
mechanical means of traction, conveyance and culti-
vation.
The Curse of Conscription.
The N. S. Wales section of the Labor
party proposes that the party at its
next whole and entire conference shall
make “No Conscription” the first plank of
the Labor platform. The Bulletin says
“Hooray” and “Hear, hear !” Compulsory and
universal military training is a curse. It is
very expensive, it is unproductive of wealth,
involves exposure to all sorts of weather,
the wearing of a sombre uniform, and
the carrying of heavy and ridiculous weap-
ons of destruction, and if it is conducive to
moralitv or the leading of the higher life
the fact hasn’t been proved. Without a
moment’s hesitation The Bulletin says
that Conscription (as some people call it)
should be put down, even if it takes oui
whole able-bodied male population to do
our bit in the good work. With one or per-
haps two exceptions every country of any
importance wants to put it down. Britain
had compulsory service of a spasmodic and
ill-defined sort for perhaps 2000 years ; but
after the Napoleonic wars all this was aban-
doned till the other day, barring a dead-
letter Act about a compulsory ballot for
militia recruits. The United States had
recourse to compulsion during the Civil
War, but then it dropped the policy till the
other day. Russia cjid remarkable things in
the way of impressing recruits in periods of
stress, but during the Long Peace or Com-
parative Peace it let the old machine rust
till the other day—the other day, of course,
happening when the German menace began
to loom large on the border. France wiped
out Conscription (so-called) after Napo-
leon’s time and only took to it with a rush
when the German wolf was at the door —
just as the German Wolf was recently at
our door. Then it reverted to compulsion
—just the other day, so to speak—but did
it too late, and it was a half-and-half army
still partly raised by voluntaryism which
went under in 1870-71. Italy took to the
expensive fad reluctantly—the other day. as
one might put it—because Austria was a.
nightmare at its gate and still held and
shamefully oppressed much Italian territory.
Conscription (to use the popular word)
ought certainly to be put dohvn. It would

never have been put up in modern times
but for the German menace and the Prus-
sian menace before that; but being up the
putting of it down is essential. And with
enough guns and enough ships and enough
inen and enough skill and courage and a
fixed resolve to disarm the chronic and
brutal disturber of the world’s peace the
thing is possible. Nobodv ever brought
down a large poisonous tree by speaking
kindly to it. and demobilising the axe. That
method wouldn’t remove even a cactus or a
rabbit, wherefore the country landowner is
compulsorily organised for battle, and if he
is a shirker or a deserter he is fined £2O
and costs. For which reasons every political
platform should have, as its first plunk,
strenuous opposition to “Conscription”—in
Germany.
Whose the Blame?
The publication of the Defence Commis-
sion’s reports has been followed by an
almost universal yell at Pearce. Upon him
it is sought to heap all the blame for the
chaos and the waste of hundreds of thou-
sands; probably millions, of pounds. Heaven
knows this paper holds no brief for the
Minister. But it says this; Pearce hasn’t
burgled or embezzled the job for which he is
no more fitted than he is to control the
North Sea Fleet; it has been given to him.
And not given to him once, but again and
again—three times at least since the shock-
ing state of the Department was officially
laid bare. For, after all, what this latest-
but-one Defence Commission has reported is
no more in effect than another Commis-
sioner, It.' McC. Anderson, reported on
April 5, 1915, just upon three years ago.
“The Finance Department,” he said, “is in
a disorganised, dissatisfied and unhealthy
condition. Under modern and reasonable
conditions it could be run with fewer men,
working easily within the regulation hours.”
Of the Ordnance branch he reported in
almost the same terms as those the recent
Commission employed. Subsequently there
were other disclosures —some made by the
Committee of Inquiry, a small body of
accountants; others in the Criminal Court.
Yet Pearce was retained in his job. When
the Phewsion was formed there was scarcely
a “Liberal” paper which didn’t say that
Pearce ought to go. But Pearce remained,
because Hughes insisted upon it; and Cook
and his hungry crowd were prepared to
swallow 50 Pearces in order to get into the
tart-shop themselves. Then came the smash
after the Referendum, and again it was said
that Pearce must go; but again Hughes
insisted upon having his man Friday with
him, and again Cook and the rest of the
“Liberals” swallowed man Friday lest they
themselves should have to leave the confec-
tionery. In these circumstances who is to
blame? Certainly not Pearce. He has done
his poor, dull, stodgy best. But without a
day’s business training this very fair car-
penter was put to the biggest business job
in Australia, and after his hopelessness had
been thoroughly proved, the Liberal side of
the Phewsion twice consented to his remain-
ing there rather than miss the chance of
getting a few jobs itself. More than any
man else Joseph Cook deserves censure for
the continued muddle in the Department.
Hughes probably believed in Pearce. Cook’s
party didn’t. Presumably Cook didn’t either.
But it was prepared to sell Australia in re-
turn for a mess of pottage. And it did.
Armageddon Begins Again.
A fortnight ago Bonar Law informed the
British House of Commons that he was
“sceptical” about a German offensive in the
West. Well, it arrived last Thursday, and
the only thing that remains to be sceptical
about is the result. There were a score of
reasons for expecting that as soon as the
German could scrape the mud off his bluchers
he would hit and do it hard. And there are
an equal number of reasons for supposing
that the enemy has planned his attack with
strict attention to detail and that he saw a
reasonable chance of making a success of the
job. At the moment of writing British and
German armies were locked in a tremendous
conflict raging over a front of about 50
miles. Saturday saw the conclusion of “the
first phase of the battle” —a phrase we have
all had mournful reason to be distrustful of
in the past. The Germans claimed to have
occupied the first positions held by their
enemies, to have taken 30,000 prisoners and
to have put a substantial portion of the Brit-
ish forces in the position of being “already
beaten.” Haig’s reports indicated that (1)
his army had suffered heavy losses, (2) the
Germans had been terribly punished, (3) his
force had at various points retired to new
positions, (4) the enemy was bringing up
strong reinforcements, and (5) his own
troops were fighting with the greatest gal-
lantry. The blunt meaning of all this was
that a terrible struggle had commenced and
that in the initial stages thereof the enemy
had gained certain advantages. The measure
of these was not clear at the beginning of the
week, for, though the British line was
said to be holding fast, there were
disturbing indications that the situation to
the north and south of St. Quentin had by
Sunday become very serious and that the
weight of the German thrust between the
Somme and the Oise was hard to bear. Cer-
tainly the German could make a material
advance in this sector and yet not be any
further forward than he was prior to the
battle of the Somme, but it is also certain
that if the defence could not hold the newer
line, the business of hanging on to the old
one will scarcely be easier. Pending further
information of the happenings at that vital
point it can be taken for granted that the
German will press on this attack with
courage, skill and resolution. He has never
failed to do this, and to expect him to flinch
now, with a victory almost in his grasp,
would be plain fatuity. Briton and Frank
have their backs to the wall and it is pro-
bable that the. best they can hope for is
to continue in that position until the
American armies become effective. That
they will fight and die like men we
know. That our own lads will stand
up to the collar is certain. But reflections
of this kind have at the best only slight
force against the inescapable fact that, unless
there are men to fill the gaps, there can ne
only one end to it all. Complete victory may
not be at stake in this mighty battle, but the
question of whether, when it is over, one or
more of the nations involved will be found
going to pieces very clearly is. All sorts of
things were on the knees of the gods when
this week started.

“The Pariaii” : From the manner in which
the war business has been handled, the
public may fairly assume that a mess has
been made of the Home Defence system;
and that is really of the utmost consequence,
because through .this maladministration the
continuance of the system is endan-
gered. Let me give a typical instance
of the sort of thing foi* which the
people pay. In the year a boy turns
12 he is examined by a doctor to test
his physical fitness for the junior cadet
work to be done in the next two years. The
medical-officer gets half a crown per cadet
examined. Last year the M.O. called at
my school, took the junior cadet record and
a seat. I lined the squad up and the M.O.
called the names. Each cadet marched up,
stood at attention, was commanded by the
M.O. to ’bout turn and go to his place. In
this way 25 boys were passed as fit in as
many minutes. One poor kid who is partly
paralysed on one side as the result of in-
fantile paralysis would have been passed as
fit had I not invited the half-crown doctor’s
attention to his halting gait as he returned
to his place. Not one boy had even his coat
off.

“11. Sec”: Nyngan (N.S.W.), where the
dogs slept in the hospital matron’s bedroom,
is not very far out. Think what may happen
further back ! There many of the matrons
are incompetent, others worse. In the hos-
pital of which I was secretary Matron A.
was incompetent and old-fashioned. She
took “funny turns” and finally had a pro-
vidential vision from Heaven which told her
to resign. Matron B. was incompetent and
peculiar. There were stories of a stand-up
fight with the nursing-staff of one. She
resigned. The next, C., was a competent
matron with a failing. Under the stress of
work she drank the medical comforts, and was
found down and out in the ward next morn-
ing. The delirious patient had gone for a
walk. She left. Matron D. was a recent
arrival with particularly high credentials
and pleasing personality. She re-filled the
dead marine that Matron C. had dropped
and lasted only two months. The climax
came when she wandered round and in-
sisted on all the patients having bread and
treacle. We had an enteric case in at the
time. She left, after some persuasion. All
these nurses presented good testimonials.
Sometimes there was a lapse of a year or two
since the last. The Government insists on a
properly trained and approved matron being
appointed, and it approved, and, as far as I
know now, still approves, of the appointment
of any of these people. Committees in their
ignorance, led astray by testimonials given
by weak or careless hospital committees, are
still liable to employ them. What can they
do? An inspector coming round now and
then could do less, for, after all, the com-
mittee is on the spot, hears what is going on
and can act immediately. All the above
cases were before the war. It must be worse
now. Perhaps if the Government controlled
the appointment of the matrons, fixing the
salaries, and periodically promoting the de-
serving matrons to more important positions,
a better class of woman would accept the
appointment of matron to the Outback hos-
pitals. Just as with school teachers.
It is time the supine Government took
Simonoff, the Russian revolutionary agent
who calls himself Consul-General, by the
collar and ran him on board the first steamer
that is going furthest away from Allied
territory, and warned him not to come back
for 1000 years. In his latest outpouring he
informed a Victorian audience that the best
way to support the Bolsheviks (sis if the
Bolsheviks can’t earn their own living) was
for the Australian people to “obtain the
management of their own social life.” Now,
as Australia manages everything by the
votes of the whole adult population, it can’t
get any more control of its “social life” than
it has.' Even if. it allowed Simonoff’s Bol-
sheviks to abolish Parliament, and set a lot
of towns and cities on fire, and rob the Sav-
ings Banks and all the other banks, and
repudiate all debts, and break up the rail-
ways, and give up washing themselves, we
couldn’t control our “social life” any more
than we do. At present a boy can take
his best girl walking on the shore by moon-
light under the protection of a brutal and
capitalistic Government resting on the prin-
ciple of one-adult-one-vote, and his life .
wouldn’t be much brighter if he was sand-
bagged by. a Dictator’s Ited Guard and woke
up later surrounded by the blessings of free-
dom to find that the girl had disappeared.
Simonoff may not- do much harm, hut lie
ought to be sent away on a charge of braying
out of his turn.

Australia’s only statesman has bungled
kerosene now. Nearly six months ago he
was asked to raise the price Is. a case, and
a promise was made that this would be
done, as from February 1. But, with
another trip to England in view, he probably
wanted to avoid the job of raising the price
of the poor man’s light and the small man’s
engine-fuel. He thought, apparently, that
the matter could wait until he was out of the
country, and then his locmn-tenens would
have to issue the unpopular order. But the
matter couldn't wait. Already a kerosene
famine has started in Sydney, and by the
middle of next month Victoria, S. Aus. and
elsewhere will be crying out for the goods.
The oil kings are no philanthropists, as
Hughes (and Heaven even) knows, and on
the present market value importers would
have to lose more than Is. a case. The rise
of Is. applied for last year will have to be
increased to Is. 6d.. it seems. And pending
the arrival of supplies some thousands of
gas engines will be out of work, and a few
thousand folks on the land will be in the
same position as Moses before the candle
went out.
“0.L.” : Towards the end of last year the
price of Victorian 1915-16 wheat scrip was
depressed to a shade over 2d. a bushel, owing
in part to the absence of published Govern-
ment information and in part to the fatigue
of the man on the land; yet by the day
when Oman, Minister for Wheat and Wee-
vils, read his vital statement in the Assembly
(13th inst.) the price had gradually climbed
to 3 9-16 d. The Minister’s figures showed
that the scrip-holder might reasonably ex-
pect to receive nearly 31d. a bushel after
allowing for expenses, as well as a possible
extra fd. through the increase in weight dur-
ing storage, the whole being subject to a
trifling contingent charge of not more than
one-eighth of a penny. So it is likely that
the actual return wall be somewhere around
4d. a bushel, or nearly 100 p.c. profit fBr
those who bought low. That won’t be all for
the speculators, however. The banks w’ere
happy to finance buyers on a very narrow
margin, with the result that some fortunate
speculators will be able to draw as much as
400 p.c. on the money actually laid out by
them to secure the producers’ wheat-scrip.
Oman’s terribly belated statement, coming
as it did at a moment when the brokers had
practically skinned the market, must leave
the 1915-1916 wheat-grower with a horrible
burr of doubt sticking to the seat of his in-
telligence. ,It smells as though some body
hasn’t been so close-mouthed on the matter
as the Minister himself.
Died at St. Kilda (Vic.), aged 79, Barnet
Glass, pioneer of the rubber-manufacturing
industry in Australia. He came from Eng-
land in 1876 and we could well do with a
million more like him.
“Rangan”: Brisbane’s Trades Hall has
just clinched an amazing bargain. Its build-
ing has been reclaimed. The land cost the
council nothing and the building cost £6OOO.
It gets in return a piece of Crown land, one
of the most dominating sites in the city, and
£14,000 in hard cash. Who put this
through ?
“Ministers welcome criticism of the De-
fence Department,” Hughes was reported to
have said the other day. Yes, they welcome
it with an order to the press under the War
Precautions Regulations making disparaging
criticism an offence.
Harry Sutherland Wightman Lawson,
Vic.’s new Premier, is over six feet long,
with a muscle cultivated on the football
fields of Castlemaine. Like J. W. McCay,
whose seat in the State House he won in
1899 as a boy of 24, Lawson is the son of a
Presbyterian parson, and though he was a
street-corner evangelist his girth and thick-
ness, combined with his popularity as a fair
footballer, barred the description “wowser.”
This is his fourth portfolio, and in an elec-
tion he is regarded as unshiftable. He is a
lawyer now, but was only an articled clerk
when he arrived.
“Voluntary” enlistment isn’t quite dead.
An expert in the business estimates that the
defeat of a hot favorite for any big race is
worth at least 25 stone-broke recruits. The
time may come when the only way to re-
inforce the Australian armv will be to bribe
John Brown and a few others to run stiff.
Walkers of Maryborough (Q.) is an enter-
prising firm in a big way, and, like the
Broken Hill Prop., it wants to build ships
for wheat- and wool- and meat-carrying. But
as the Broken Hill Prop, received warning
from the Hughes Government to leave off,
Walkers is wise in its generation and waits
awhile before trying to fill a long-felt want.
Now, how is it that these private concerns
are anxious to start in such a casual way,
without 24 months’ negotiation with the
unions, while Hughes and Cook are still
busy wasting a ton of paper on protocols
and draft treaties?

“Padjud”: “Arthur It.” confidently pre-
dicts (B. 7/3/T8) that the lofty aerial gear
now used in wireless telegraphy will soon
be a thing of the past. Perhaps. But at
present the tendency is in the direction of
higher towers. About 12 months ago the
Germans added 300 ft. to the mainmast at
Nauen station (near Berlin), giving it a
total height of 900 ft. An idea of the calibre
of the station may be got from the fact that
readable signals from it are commonly re-
ceived in Maoriland and Australia. Those
brief German “official” reports, which are
sent out for the world to intercept, are fre-
quently picked up by stations as far away
as ours. Perhaps by ours. Only Mr. Hughes
can tell you that. Eiffel Tower is gener-
ally conceded to be one of the most efficient
stations on earth. This is solely owing to
the immense height of the mast —985 ft.
Thus the engineers’ dictum, “height for effi-
ciency,” is borne out. Funibashi, the giant
Japanese station recently opened, has 19
masts, a central tower of 650 ft. set in a ring
of 18 others each of 260 ft. All rest on ball
and socket joints, and thus, like Nauen,
depend on steel guy-ropes.
“Cherokee”: Some years ago, when Vic.
Parliament was legislating to prevent “wine-
shop weddings,” cases were dug out in which
the ’groom knew the bride only as Ducky or
something similar. But it has remained for
Collingwood to produce (trust Collingwood!)
a gentleman who did not know his bride’s
first monniker, but only her surname. The
lady, Mary Elizabeth Doyle, otherwise
Toms, aged 59, is now under committal for
trial on a bigamy charge. In 1903, it seems,
James McMurtrie, a South Melbourne
hawker, wedded her, knowing her only as
Mrs. Toms. She said she was a widow.
Some years later she said that if he did not
clear out she would hit him with an axe.
He wouldn’t chance the axe, and the Court
made an order for 7s. 6d. a week, which he
paid until she began to sign the receipts
“Mrs. Doyle.” He took the hint and ceased
payment. On November 28, 1914, she
married William Henry Berryman, but
the parson refused to hand over the
marriage lines because he failed to
get his fee. The lady candidly told a
constable that she had gone to a party and
“got shick.” She regarded the whole thing
as a joke. On the evidence, it teas rather
casual. Beimyman’s sister saw a matri-
monial ad., and sent him to see Mrs. Doyle.
“I’m looking for a wife,” he said. “And
I’m looking for a husband,” said she. They
at once agreed to chance it. After a fort-
night’s matrimony he found his clothes
packed up in the bathroom, and they separ-
ated. Love still can have its dream, even at
59. But in Collingwmod the awakening is
liable to be sudden.

There is one infallible test for successful
melodrama. If the audience frenziedly
applauds when the hero, with the -spotlight
registered upon his face, raises his arm and
declares: “By the sainted memory of my
dead solicitor I swear that an isosceles tri-
angle is equilateral!” that melodrama is in
for a long run. It doesn’t matter what the
hero says; it’s the way the spotlight helps
him to say it. Judged by that test, “The
Woman Thou Gavest Me,” a melodramati-
sation by John Cosgrove of Hall Caine’s in-
terminable novel, produced at the Opera
House on Saturday, will at least equal pre-
vious long-distance records.
* * # #
There is nothing in this play to wound the
soul of the most rabid sectarian, or bring a
blush to the cheek of sweet innocence. In-
deed, a husband at the Opera House will
learn more about the nobility of wives than
he had ever suspected at home; and the
religious element is quite innocuous. The
villainy is plain, but it is polished ; and when
the vampire vamps she vamps with decorum.
The scenic artist excels himself in some
stage-pictures, especially in an Antarctic
snow-scene. Though the blizzard is heard
but does not otherwise make itself evident,
the effect of solitude and cold is impressive.
And it is in this scene that this melodrama
proves true to type. The hero is leading an
exploration party to the South Pole ; he is
only 100 miles away from it; but his men
are unwilling to go further. He appeals to
them to support him in the final dash, and
sends them 'off into the blizzard to get an
extra ration of grog. Then, while an aurora
Australis works overtime in the background,
the hero prays. His prayer is answered by
a vision of the heroine ins'.de the aurora.
She is evidently in trouble. The brave
“THE WOMAN THOU GAVEST ME,"
AT SYDNEY GRAND OPERA HOUSE.
John Cosgrove, author and producer of the
piece, wondering how he can prevent George
Cross perspiring at the South Pole.
•explorer summons his men from the back
premises of the blizzard and announces that
he, too, has decided upon a retreat. The men
welcome this ignoble decision, and give them-
selves three cheers for going home. It is
true that the hero, as an afterthought, re-
quests them to promise to return next year
for another attempt, and they cheer them-
selves some more. Then the curtain descends,
and on Saturday evening the whole vast
audience applauded. Applauded what? The
decision of those intrepid explorers to chuck
their job! The dramatiser evidently knows
his audience.
George Cross is a noble hero, manly and
sonorous ; his foil, Rutland Beckett, provides
a clever and almost subtle study of villainy;
John Cosgrove is an attractive old parish
priest; but Charles Stanford’s conception
of the heroine’s cruel father is rather crude.
Harry McDona and Mabel Lynne capably
afford the usual farcical relief; Elsie Prince
is sufficiently pathetic and pleasant to look
upon as the persecuted heroine; Muriel Dale
vamps with the proper intensity; and Helen
Fergus, as a Rev. Mother, is sufficiently
saintly. The 13 scenes of this elaborate pro-
duction are well contrived, and the support
of a large cast do’es not call for any curses.
On Thursday evening of this week Marie
Tempest will be “Mrs. Dot” for the last
time at Sydney Criterion. On Saturday “A
Pair of Silk Stockings” will show the Eng-
lish star and Graham Browne in what is
claimed to a somewhat different comedy.

rupted by Good Friday, when all shows will
produce Something Solemn, guaranteed not
to cause archbishops loss of sleep. At the
Crystal Palace, however, a se-rmon on
“Womanhood” will see the week through.
This is another of ’Murka’s “preparedness”
propaganda films, and its moral applies even
more strongly to this empty continent. Doug.
Fairbanks illustrates a “Wild and Woolly”
time at Hoyt’s and the Haymarket in his
usual knock-about, hair-raising way. “The
Garden of Allah,” the film of Robt. Hichens’s
fine novel, survives another week at the
Lyric.

Last week has disappeared and Sydney
Hippodrome audie’nces still don’t know when
the unsociable lion that regards the world
with a sour eye intends to bite a meal out
of the trainer. Every night the beast seemed
on the verge of a great offensive and glared
at the whip with intense hatred. This paper
has a strong suspicion that one of these
evenings the brute will provide more thrill
to the proceedings than is mentioned on the
day’s menu. Meanwhile the man in charge
goes on with his job as unconcernedly as if
he was merely running a Defence Depart-
ment. This disregard of calamity and their
complete concentration on the business in
hand is the most cheerful feature of all cir-
cus performers’ work. Whether it is the
elephant standing on its hind legs, or the
lady dancing on an invisible wire, or the
limber gentleman who whirls rapidly through
the atmosphere on to his feet, each is for
the moment Engrossed in that incident to the
exclusion of everything else on earth. And
that is why they get through with a fine
certainty and three cheers from the stout
citizen who only concentrates on refresh-
ments. It being Easter, the writer intends
forwarding a bouquet of buns to the
grotesque imitation of one Chaplin who
waves himself at impossible' angles in the
breeze and falls heavily in a scientific heap
from gi’eat heights. Why he emerges from
the smash without a broken neck is a dark,
inscrutable mystery.

All the Melbourne theatres, save the
King’s, ai-e waiting for a week-end change
of bill. The King’s is still proceeding with
“Turn to the Right,” and (lie essential good-
ness of Mrs. Baseom will communicate mys-
terious virtue to her peach jam until further
orders. Also the mushroom residence on the
hillside, in the last act, will give the cne
for the final curtain by turning out its bed-
room light. The lighting and darkening of
that domicile, indicate the quickest retire-
ment to rest ever accomplished in the whole
history of honeymoon couples.
At the Melbourne Royal there will be a
change of company on Easter Saturday.
Muriel Starr gives place tb Kathlene
Macdonell, and the comedy in view is “The
Cinderella Man.” Charles Waldron is his

Thursday night of “You’re in Love” will
be its last at Melbourne Majesty’s. Not to
waste a new production upon a holiday
week, when any old thing will do, J.C.W. is
putting up “Canary Cottage” on Saturday.
“Canary Cottage” is a dear old thing, and

MELBOURNE KING’S.

its six nights and matinees will fill the bill
with gladness. “C.C.,” in its way, always
takes the cake. And if it isn’t a cake it’s
a pudding, as Connie Ediss would say.
Peter Dawson is singing his last at Mel-
bourne Tivoli before going into camp to
follow the drum. A varied vaudeville bill
apart from Peter includes Ella Caspers, Joe
Blascheek and others Too Numerous to Men-
tion. The performers last named are long
and favorably known to everybody, and will
presumably remain at the Tiv. when the
bill is changed again on Good Friday. The
coming name to conjure with is “Samples,”
seemingly.

Gregan McMahon has wisely abandoned
his intention of producing “The .Madras
House” at Melbourne Playhouse this week.
The Repertory Co.’s performance is to hap-
pen on Saturday, April 13, and be repeated
on the Tuesday following.

Our old friend William Desmond is the
big Irish hero in “The Sudden Gentleman”
at Melbourne Majestic this week. As an im-
promptu millionaire in American surround-
ings, William is the happy hero turning sad-
ness into gladness and warming the woman
in a cold coquette. The second feature, “The
Awakening.” is a case of love in Bohemia,
picturing all the poverty and high vitality
of that curious region. Montagu Love and
Dorothy Kelly register every aspect of human
feeling in the principal parts.
** * *
“Robinson Crusoe” continues to be the
twice-a-day feature at Melbourne Bijou. The
panto, is weak in its remembrance of the
ancient story, and has somehow mislaid the
faithful Friday, who was aide-de-camp and
valet to the original hero. There is a story
to the effect that he is in the Federal Minis-
try. Still there is no lack of Friday’s rela-
tives. In fact, the balance of the week is
obvious, headed by a Coon Queen who seems
lonely without a banjo and a slice of water-
melon. Also the entertainment is strong in
panto, essentials. A fantastic touch is lent
by a weirdly-garbed Demon whose only
human quality is a baritone voice. As far
as the present writer can see, the rest of him
is green limelight and delirium tremens.
Melbourne Auditorium is having a week of
“20.000 Leagues Under the Sea.” which is
a first cousin of Jules Verne’s narrative, not
less startling than its relative while it keeps
to the surface events, and even more thrill-
ingly adventurous when it takes a header.
The production is alleged to have cost half a
million dollars ; doubtless a lot of the,cash was
needed to bribe the submarine photographer
to face the Jim Jam family that pose as fish
in those parts. One would need a shandy-
gaff of rum and absinthe, stirred with a stick
of dynamite, before one could conceive any-
thing approaching the deep sea of this won-
derful film. Next Saturday the camera
swings back several centuries and concen-
trates on Geraldine Farrar in “Joan the
Woman.”

Douglas. Fairbanks is jumping out of the
gloom at Hoyt’s, Melbourne, this week as a
vivacious tenderfoot in “Wild and Woolly.”
Despite his saccharine manner, he has mus-
tard beneath, and that ingredient comes to
the surface when he encounters a bad man and
a mob of wild Injuns. Redskins also figure
with greater prevalence and tumult in “Her
Own People,” featuring Lenore Ulrich.
Lenore is the bit of color in a white man’s life,
and there are some big scenes where his rela-
tives urge him to change the tint. Hoyt’s
Olympia is also filming the first chapter of a
serial, “Who is Number One?”
Chief Justice Griffith hurried up in a
brutal fashion with lus report that 5400
new troops.per month are required to keep
the Australian forces up to strength. If
he had only been decent and lingered in the
orthodox fashion, Hughes and Cook might
have been on their way to England before
the problem of getting all these men had to
be faced.
The eight ships which the Australian Gov-
ernment was getting built in the U.S. may
probably be written off as a delusion. Uncle
Sam, like everybody else, is taking over un-
finished ships—anybody’s ships—to supply
his own needs. So we bump up once more
against the problem of doing things our-
selves.
As the Northern Territory is under direct
Federal control the Hughes Ministers might
have covered themselves with a spebk of
glory by < settling the meat difficulty there.
The slaying of beeves is a large industry
at Darwin, and commands high wages—in
fact, extra wages are paid in the Territory
for most industries. This year the offer was
that 20 weeks’ work should be guaranteed,
that the industrial award wages should be
paid whatever they might be (a new award
was then expected) with one-third added —
that is to say, the lawful £ should really be
£1 6s. Sd. —and that the employees should
receive their fares to Darwin and back, with
£lO travelling allowance. As a side issue
the beef companies asked for a promise that
there should be no strikes this time. The
terms were refused, whereon the meatworks
decided to let the ox live. This meant leaving
1000 men out of work. The Australian
Government as boss of the territory rose to
the occasion and said nothing. However,
it was at last agreed that there should be
a sort of half-season, which will presumably
employ the men already on the spot. Thus
the bullocks will draw lots and one will be
taken and the other left. And that is how
we develop the Northern Territory, though
even the war is hardly more important.
“Peter” : Mannix is the first Victorian E.C.
prelate to make extensive use of the motor-
car. He is always whizzing about in a smart
single-seater, and is no slower than Hughes
in turning his vehicle into a rostrum. Also
he likes the convenience of a car for rapid
runs to Mass. The other Sunday morning
he skimmed past me with his famous biretta
aloft in an evident hurry to keep an appoint-
ment at St. Pat’s Cathedral. The late Dr.
Carr never showed the same admiration for
modern inventions. A nice languid brougham
was more in his line.
“The Old Soldier”: It never has been
easy in England—and I doubt whether it
ever was easy anywhere else—to raise an
army by voluntary enlistment. For quite a
century the War Office has never paid less
than £1 to the recruiting N.C.O.'s for every
man attested ; and, to my certain knowledge,
during the Crimean and the Mutiny, in
both of which I fought, recruits were paid
£5 to attest.
“Murrabit”: Various Departments, State
as well as Commonwealth, and many private
firms, are reaping the benefit of the policy
of the Vic. Education Department to afford
facilities for its best teachers to procure a
University degree. For a good many years
now 20 of them have been nominated for a
free course which puts them on the track to
an Arts or Science diploma. What the De-
partment has not realised is that there is a
demand at good salaries for qualified men,
and that it does not supply the good salaries.
The consequence is that there is a steady
stream to the private colleges as teachers
and a snapping-up of good billets in labora-
tories by the scientifically qualified. The
Department recently woke up to this fact,
and now requires its nominees to enter into
a bond to serve four years in its schools.
What it wants to realise is that salaries in
keeping with a man’s qualifications ought to
be paid if it really requires such men. If
it does not, then the sooner the taxpayer is
relieved of the burden of the cost the better;
if the national benefits are recognised, then,
let the system be extended so that other'
bright youths, who are not teachers, may
have a chance.

“What do you think of my new silk bathing
costume? It cost five guineas!”
“Well, there's not much to show for your
money.”
“Why, how much more would you show?”
“Copabella”: One of the best workers in
our Red Cross branch is a white-haired old
lady with grandsons at the Front. The
branch packed Christmas-boxes last Septem-
ber, and grandma enclosed in hers a loving
note and signed it “Annie Box and
note reached a lonely boy in Palestine, and
back came a reply brimming with gratitude.
It, too, was lover-like and intimate in its
appreciation of the “dear Annie” it addressed
by name so frankly and so frequently,
Grandma replied as lovingly, admitted white
locks and 70-odd years, and enclosed proof.
Other “dear Annie” letters had followed the
joyous pioneer. Last week came the first reply
since the disillusioning photo, was enclosed.
It contained a picture of a round-faced lad;
but the lover-like motif remained in the
accompanying letter—and so did the “dear
Annie” method of address. Billjim said
beautifully that “Annie” was dearer to him
than ever!
“Gron”: It happened at the 3rd London
General Hospital inquiry counter. A modest
maiden of 40 or thereabouts tripped gush-
ingly up to the counter and blushingly con-
fided that she wanted to see an Australian
sergeant. "What’s his name?” was the not
unnatural query. “Jack,” gurgled the maid.
“Jack who?” "Well, really I don’t know.
You see, I met him the other day and a
friend of his told me that his wound has
broken down and that he’s in bed again.”
“But you must realise that there are 2500
patients in this hospital and about half of them
are Australians. If you can give me any-
thing to go on, I’ll try to find him for you.”
Eve pondered. "Well, he’s tall, and dark,
and handsome; and”—in a burst of confi-
dence—“his father owns a place called Tas-
mania !”
* * * *
“The Old Soldier”: There is a ferocious
old rule of war which hasn’t been strictly
enforced since Magdeburg. Up to a certain
point artillery fire is very effective; but
when the works are levelled it is necessary
to bring up infantry to take possession of
the ground. Artillery kills or wounds com-
paratively few men unless they are standing
exposed in open ground ; but when the works
are beaten flat it can make a desperate
defence against infantry. That was the rea-
son for the old rule that, if a garrison per-
sists in defending itself after a practicable
breach has been made in the works, the be-
siegers may put it to the sword if they take
the place by assault or blockade. We have
got it into our heads that it is only in this
war that humane ideas have been thrown
overboard, but there were old practices at
which we should even now shudder.
“Troopering R.8.R.” : I met my first Ger-
man officer the morning after we captured
Beersheba. He was posing as a Zeppelin,
and was decidedly swollen-headed. I sup-
pose he was the best kind of Prussian you
could wish to see—he was very dead. Later,
however, his manner became more offensive,
so I parted with two piastres to a member
of the Egyptian Labor Corps, and the proud
Hun hit a well-bottom some 20 feet down.
He was wearing a pair of riding-boots,
which he lost some days later owing to a
venturesome Anzac coveting them and, after
resisting the temptation for 24 hours, brav-
ing the multitudinous odors in the pit. The
glorv of war!

If the Hawkesbury bridge (N.S.W.) is
blown up or blown down the greatest rail-
way system in Australia will be cut in
two. Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide —that is
to say, nearly half of N. S. Wales, all of
Victoria-, all S. Australia and Westralia—
will be on one side of the break. The rest
of N. S. Wales and all Queensland will be
on the other side. North of the smashed
link will be more than three-quarters of the
Commonwealth’s coal supply. South of it
will be more than three-fourths of the Com-
monwealth’s population, so demand will be
on one side of a river 3000 ft. wide and the
supply on the other. There is no alternative
route to Sydney, except by a detour of 260
miles. The bridge might be rebuilt in two
years, provided it wasn’t blown up again.
The matter is one of supreme importance,
especially if German vessels like the Wolf
are about, carrying bomb-dropping aero-
planes, and more especially if an obliging con-
federate helped with signals. If the oblig-
ing confederate put dynamite under the
bridge bombs might not be wanted. So to
be armed against all hazards the railway
points at Hawkesbury Bridge were lately
put in charge of an unregistered alien with
a German name, and he was last week fined
20s. and costs for non-registration. He was
described as belonging to Switzerland, a
composite land where t\Vo-thirds of the
population is German. When the person
with the Hun name was being fined the
magistrate “expressed surprise.” He seems
a person very easily startled.

“Boyd Cable”: I am at present with “the
Night Fliers,” whose job is to bomb Ger-
many. On their strength is an Australian —
an Adelaide man, I think ; Wald, by name —
who recently put up a good show. He was
out to drop the eggs the other night and
when about 10 to 15 miles over the line his
pressure-feed went dud. If that’s too tech-
nical I may explain that petrol is forced to
the engine by pressure and in the savage cold
these nights—round about 30 degrees of frost
in the air—the pump gadget is apt to play
tricks. Wald turned back and when on the
safe side started tinkering round and with-
out landing managed to rectify the trouble.
Trouble of this sort would have quite justi-
fied any man’s coming down and chucking
the show, but Wald turned and went back
to have another whirl at it. When some
distance over he again struck misery; escap-
ing steam blowing in his face and the behavi-

our of certain instruments gave him plain
warning that his engine radiator had burst—
another frequent danger in extreme cold.
The steam was so thick presently that he
could not see any of his instruments and it
was only by leaning well out overboard that
he was able to pick up bearings and steer a
course. With the burst radiator he knew he
couldn’t make his programmed objective, so
he decided to steer for a Hun railway
station and siding he knew the location of,
and unload his frightfulness on it. He was
taking heavy risks every minute he stayed
over Hunland with his dud engine, especi-
ally as the wind was strong and side on.
But he stuck to it, found his target, splashed
his bombs down on or about it —couldn’t be
sure what damage he did because the ’bus
was blow-ing steam in clouds —then turned
and pushed for home. He could not make
his own ’drome because the engine went on
strike and completely phutted soon after he
crossed the line, but he found a landing and
put the old ’bus safely on the floor. Stout
effort, eh?
SEEKING A TIP FROM PA.
“And always speak the truth. I never told
lies' when I was a boy.”
“When’s a fair time to begin, Dad?”
“Neddie”; I was a kid when John Red-
mond came to Ballarat and stirred Bungaree
to the depths of its Hibernian being with
his eloquence. “What have you done for
Ireland?” was the burden of one deliverance
in the old Alfred Hall. When all was said
the exuberant admirers of Redmond filed
up for a grip of his fist, and Redmond’s
greeting to the more enthusiastic was, “What
have you done for Ireland?” Came O’Neil,
a big red devil of a man. “What havq you
done for Ireland?” said Redmond. “Done
fer Oireland!” cried the O’Neil. “Haven’t
I this night put me brick troo the windy of
Parson Anthrews?” Parson Andrews was a
rampant anti-llome Ruler, who had been
attacking Redmond with great vehemence.
A policeman who overheard O'Neil reached
for him, and next day O’Neil was tried
for the confessed offence, and fined heavily.
As O’Neil left court, a proud boy, another
Irishman, larger, wilder and more fiery,
stepped up and felled him to the pavement.
“Take that for the dirty liar ye are,” said
he, “stealin’ away the glory from a better
man. You know as well as anny man livin’
’twas me troo that brick!”
“R.8.R.”: Pacifists and others who still
doubt Germany’s Eastern dream should see
Beersheba. A railway station about 300
yards long, with excellent stone stores, all
red-tiled, makes the heart of a Sydneyite
thump with the thoughts of red-roofed
Mosman. There is also a fine two-storeyed
hospital over which the Turkish Red Cres-
cent still flew when we entered the town,
an Administrative building of like design,
and an extremely imposing mosque bearing
unmistakable Hunnish footprints, evidently
built with the intention of showing Jacko
chat the great William has Mahomet as
well as Gott in the partnership. All build-
ings are floored with marble slabs, very
cool in hot weather and easily cleansed.
Before the fateful August of ’l4 not one stone
of these reared its head above the dusty
plain. And this is not all. Even under
the pressure of war a magnificent park has
been laid out in the centre of the town and
planted with Australian eucalypts and with
groves of wattle, all now with about three
years’ growth. It is under these trees of
their native land that the heroic dead from
Australia are buried.
FLOWER OF WAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The soundless planes of trance
Had whirled me past a hundred sleeping years,
And dimly, far below, through haze of tears,
I saw the Wound of France.
From little hill to town,
From road to river silver-string it ran—
An endless hurt: and, like a swooning man,
I drifted slowly down.
bo, all the growing things
Were steeped in red, and red, and red again,
As though dead years still fanned their blooms of pain
With unforgetting wings.
Here swayed red violets;
There grass was red, and marched with crimson
plumes
To where tall scarlet lilies spilt perfumes
Above red mignonettes.
A daisy bowed its head
Vainly to hide its shapeless, bloodied spots
From eyes of jubilant forget-me-nots—
Forget-me-nots of red.
But, checkered on the sod
Among the flowers, stood rows of crosses white.
They wore no red : they flamed with living light—
The glory-gold of God.

“Jacko”: Just to pile a little more on to
the big military-boot bungle disclosed by
the Defeuee Commission’s report, allow me
to explain the system of hoofing the Com-
monwealth’s defenders. For the past three
years, parades and other regular work for
the Citizen Forces have been suspended, the
equipment recalled and
the issue of clothing-
cut right out. But for
some reason the boot
issue has remained.
And this is the way'
the leather is handed
out. The various
units are called into
camp for eight days’
training. After sev-
eral days have gone,
word comes round for
a boot parade, where-
upon each trainee is
obliged to display the
condition of his foot-
wear to the O.C. If
the officer thinks that
a new pair would come
in handy for any par-
ticular man, down
goes the name for the
tans on the strength
of appearances. The
other fellows, who
might have happened
to don a decent pair
of uppers, go without,
even though everyone
is on the same work.
In a recent camp at
Liverpool (N.S.W.)
I saw college students,
doctors’ sons and other
well-to-do lads pre-
sented with boots by
kind Mr, Pear ce.
Others, on eight bob a
day in ordinary life,
were compelled to use their own property
simply because it happened to' be usable.

“0.K.” : John Madden ought to be remem-
bered by the Melbourne Presbyterian
Ladies’ College for his excellent advice to
its young ladies. In his Supreme Court
capacity Madden was merely a strict moral-
ist who judged, the ill-regulated by his own
powers of self-restraint, and talked foolishly ;
but as a paternal adviser of growing gen-
tility lie was a Madden who had carefully
studied the ways of young womanhood in
his polite family circle. What he didn’t
know about the orthodox tricks of the femi-
nine trade was not worth knowing; pro-
bably because he watched the tricks being
practised from the beginning and therefore
saw- through them so easily, he begged the
dear, clever girls to moderate their fond
belief in their own cleverness. “Young ladies,”
said the benign orator, “give themselves a
lot of undeserved credit for being able to
’get round’ men and ‘tw-ist them round their
little finger,’ and so forth. What they don’t
understand is that men. as a rule, are not
being deceived at all. They see you getting
round them, and because the process is very-
pleasant they are apt to make it last a long
time.” Perhaps John Madden over-esti-
mated the number of the men who are not
actually fooled by Gwendoline, but his esti-
mate of the amount of intellect required for
fooling the fooler was not a bit too small.
Probably for every woman who deludes a
man there are five men who can delude a
woman; so if she be half as clever as she
thinks herself, the guile of the male must be
immense.

of women and children. Whereupon two of them,
one an ex-Fusilier Marin, of those immortal 3000
who held Dixmude against 60,000 Germans for
several days, without food, to save the rest of
their mates, and the other a man who was at
Gallipoli, where he received five wounds and the
War Cross, , told me of the sights they witnessed,
when the war was young. Some v’omen bore the
familiar mutilation of the breasts, and the children
of the hands. Here is a. young cadet, whose father
was taken away by the Boches and never was heard
of again, for daring to object to the shooting, after
the usual kultur trimmings, of his wife and throe
sisters-in-law. A Verdun man told me his island
town of BelleHsle-en-Mer still has over 1000 mothers
of German bastards. All these girls were under 18 ; ‘
many of them are inmates of the lunatic asylum.
And always with a puzzled face they ask me about
our strikes —can it be so? Then it must be German
intrigue. It never occurs to them that such things
could in the circumstances happen otherwise. God
forgive me, I lie and say it is so.

From France :
We still have 11 of the old horses which we

they were in mud and snow up to their hocks. I’ve
seen their tails and fetlocks frozen as hard as a rock,
and to water them the drivers had to break
through 2ft. of ice. All the feed they got was,
approximately, 91b. of oats and 51b. of hay per day—
nothing more, though sometimes they were working
right round the clock.
Al! the good Aussies don’t do their bit on
two legs.

The name of the German raider Wolf was
a grievance in itself, for it reminded thou-
sands of people of the hackneyed saying
about the wolf in sheep’s clothing, and they
repeated it till it became a misery. The
name had no points about it, anyhow. Some
centuries ago, before the drill-sergeant had
kicked all. the humor out of the German, that
person did actually perpetrate a jest on the
high seas. It was in the days when the
Hanseatic League was in its glory, and the
Victualling Brethren were doing wholesale
piracy on the .waters. The League grew wild
at the plunder of its goods and chattels, and
organised a fleet to argue with the Brethren.
Its admiral was a mayor in his spare time
and a sort of universal provider in business
hours, lie called his flagship the Brindle
Cow, to imply thiit he was a man of peace,
and only went to war as a matter of neces-
sity. The admiral of the Brethren called his
flagship the Mad Dog, to explain that he was
a holy terror by choice and a blood-drinker
by preference. The moral is that there is no
one so terrible as a universal provider suffer-
ing from oppression, unless it be, as in the
case of Spinola, the Italian, a banker who
has taken up arms to recover his overdraft.
The Brindle Cow and its consorts swept the
Brethren off the seas,, and the Hanseatic
admiral went home without knowing that
there was anything comical about his
arrangements.
BULGED OUT OF HER CLASS.
“I thought she said she’d accept him if he
enlisted.”
“Yes; but he’s developed into such a fine big
chap that he won’t look at her now.”
“Pork and Beans”: These English learn
slowly, and there is great danger that
they won’t learn quickly enough to
save themselves and the Empire. On
leave in Blighty, with another N.C.O.
I strolled into the Coal Hole in the
Strand. Noticing “Private Bar” on a door
in the rear, we walked in and found three
civilians drinking. The Hebe behind the
counter told us that “only officers and gentle-
men” were served there. I boiled over and
asked to see the manager. Up bustled a
dame with: “I’m the manageress and it’s
quite right.” I told her in our plain Aus-
tralian language what I thought of her rules
and the probable future of a country that
tolerated such things. Put me in mufti, and
this bar will serve me. Put me in khaki, as
proof that I’m doing my duty to my country,
and this bar. like hundreds more, will turn
me down. Could there be a greater insult
to the uniform? Yet the thing is quite
typical. The uniform is dirt. Do these
people really deserve to be saved?

“Ellae”: Re “J.l.F.’s” comforting p'ar
(B. 14/2/’18) about the, Lost Soldiers’ De-
partment at the Vatican. We, whose last
authentic record of one of our soldier boys
is a “Missing and believed prisoner’ of war”
some 10 months old, rushed the Bulletin
round to the house of a kindly returned
Priest in our neighborhood to ask for fur-
ther particulars. After courteously giving
us every possible help in the matter, he told
us that he has repeatedly tried to have men-
tion made of this matter in the daily papers,
but has been unable to get it. How’s that
for vicious sectarianism in war-time, when
thousands like ourselves are frantically seek-
ing any means to supplement the dreadful
"No further information available” which
threatens to shadow the rest of our lives?
INSIDE INFORMATION.
SEDATE : “ D’you think Peace is near?”
Ga AY: “I’m sure of it. Th’ wife starts on
her holidays to-morrow.”
“4 x 2”: Here’s my experience of the
“help” the returned man gets. I enlisted in
November, 1914, and went away with the
second contingent. After a spell in Gallipoli
I was invalided and discharged. Having been
a pearler before enlisting, I naturally tried
to return to the work. A small pearling
lease, insufficient to support a man, came
up for tender, and after protracted negotia-
tions I was granted.it on very favorable
terms. Later a larger lease came up. I put
in in the ordinary way, and before the result
was announced was informed by
the Colonial Secretary (whose
decision it rested upon) that the
matter was between myself and
a civilian whose tender was 2U
pounds higher than mine. I
offered to make up my tender to
the same amount, but, finally, the
lease was granted to the civilian
on the grounds that he had six
small children. I have since
found out that his children are
two boys over the age of 18 years,
two girls over 20, one boy over
16, the others over 12. But,
better than children, he had
several members of Parliament to push his
barrow. 1 think I had better go back to the
was as a Y.M.C.A. reinforcement. They have
refused me in any other capacity.
“Tito” : Australian daily newspapers were
permitted to grossly libel the Italians when
the llun fell upon them, and they have done
practically nothing to correct their misinfor-
mation. Their story about the Germans
weakening the Italian fighting spirit with a
few showers of pamphlets is still widely
prevalent in suburban circles, though the
fable received no publicity in leading Italian
journals. Aosta’s Third Army showed bril-
liance in dodging punishment on the way back
from the Carso, and Bersaglieri and Alpini
exacted two corpses for every one against
three or four times their own strength in
ferocious in-fighting. The Italians also con-
trived unbelievable ingenuities in the lagoons
about Venice ; they invented floating islands
that poured out annihilation from camou-
flaged guns, but apparently there was no
Australian pen to paint the achievement.
That the retreat was a great performance is
proved bv the fact that the Italians are #till
holding the Piave line, though the British
and French reinforcements commenced to dig
in on the much stronger Adige line, believ-
ing it impossible that they could hold the
enemy pack from that river. The Italians
altogether showed a character for doggedness
in a terrible situation that merited the loud-
est publicity. The shameful thing is that
Australian papers imputed Boloism to Italy
at the very moment the Commonwealth was
voting down Conscription.
COMPLETE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The German offensive plans are being completed.”
The plans are quite complete. The gathered hosts
Shudder a little at the shell-torn rear.
There are the usual raids, the usual boasts
To tell that murder’s triumph-hour is near;
And up and down the line the cannon roar,
While seas of flame from hidden throats outpour.
Though wilted Russia play the Kaiser’s game,
Releasing armies that are ripe to die,
Though Krupp with restless wheels feed flame to
flame
And tanks crawl down the mud with burning eye,
Things can’t be worse than those that made last year
The worst that ever plagued the hemisphere.
Guns, steel and men, the plans are quite complete;
Yet with strange confidence the nations stand
That shock of shocks with valiant heart to meet
And tear the triumph from the despot’s hand.
They stood before; and they will stand again
Victorious in the drenching fiery rain.
And see, they come! Dense wave on wave they break
Against the rocky front of freedom’s pride.
In agony the hills asd valleys shake
At the vast swirl of the outgoing tide.
And then, across, the wreckage backward hurled,
Comes in slow light the morning of the world.
The plans are quite complete. The word “Advance”
Makes a bold headline on the printed sheet;
And, with the whip of scorn, from tortured France
' Begins at last the Teuton's red retreat. .
No pause, no rest; but, in a storm of steel,
Hot terror presses at his flying heel!
May these things be? Hope ever stirs arid prods
The ’ heart to take the optimistic view ;
But counting fairly all the risks and odds,
Our crowd looks good enough to see it through.
And while the challenge through the darkness peals
The Kaiser’s wondering how hanging feels.

AN UNEXPECTED MEETING WITH THE BLUEGUM FAMILY.
“We were riding through a small village near Jaffa, gazing at the inhabitants who thronged the doorways of the Jewish quarter, when what looked like the oldest inhabitant asked one of us if he didn 't come from Brisbane. Lived
there once,’ said the horseman, and was begged to call when he had a few minutes’ spell. Billjim had a yarn with the family later on. The ancient Jew had been in business in Brisbane in the eighties, it seemed, but, attiacted by a
colonisation scheme, he had returned to the land of his forefathers. The old chap put in a good word for Billjim with the rest of the village population, and ‘backsheesh’ fruit was plentiful.” Light horseman in Palestine to THE BULLETIN.

The great Griffith had his Reinforcements

preferred to follow it into the morning.
Gone west at 25, Adrian Consett Stephen,
lieutenant of field artillery in France.
Young Stephen came of the well-known Syd-
ney legal family, and was himself about to
start at the N. S. Wales Bar when the
world wqs turned upside down in l:u4. He
got a commission with British artillery, and
in three muddy years in Flanders he had
figured tAvice in despatches and annexed the
French Croix de Guerre as well as the Mili-
tary Cross. At Sydney Uni. a few years ago
Stephen was about the brightest spark in the
rather dull Hermes, the ’Varsity magazine;
and his letters from the Front to its pages
in later years Avere always worth reading.
He promised to be a brilliant playwright,
and some of his essays in that direction have
been staged by the University Dramatic
Society and the Sydney Stage Club.
In the old days Hughes Avas very fond of

JONES: “Bali ! EVERY man should go."
“M.C.”: The death of Col. George Lane-
Mullins revives memories of the Dabor
Bazaar, conducted by Messrs. Mullins and
Maher, in Ritt-street, Sydney, just about
where City Tatt.’s raises its blatant voice.
The original Mullins Avas coachman to Arch-
bishop Bolding, if a Bulletin paragraphist
of many years ago was correct. This par.
said: —
How proud Avould Mick Mullins, when he was
driving the carriage for Archbishop Polding, have
been if he could have seen his two sons going off to
Oxford. Sydney colleges are not good enough for
Sydney natives.
George Mullins did not go to Oxford, how-
ever, but to Dublin. Before he matriculated
he went from the Grammar to St. Kilda
House, newly opened by the Jesuit Fathers.
This was just after the awful turn-up at
Bathurst, when Mr. Kenna was refused
burial in the R.C. portion of the cemetery
because he wanted to send his boy to another
school. This so frightened the recalcitrants
that St. Kilda House had a great influx, in-
cluded in which were the scions of the
houses of Mullins, Maher and Hughes.
George Mullins was at this school for some
months and learned more Greek than he had
dreamed of previously. After matriculation
here, he went to Dublin, and so on to liand-
wick No. 4. If the authorities had given him
a square deal, he would have been there still.
Archbish. Mannix is keeping strange com-
pany at Kew (Vic.). Across the river from
his palace is another large, building which
the Vic. Government proposes to turn into
a Venereal Diseases Hospital. As the man-
sion next door is the home of John Wren,
who will probably object to the existence of
such a neighbor, there is every likelihood
that the Government will change its mind.
Apart from the ethics of the question, no
Government should have an opinion contrary
to ex-Citizen Wren.
SUNSET.
The Rev. John Saunders, father of Dr.
Renwick’s widow—the estimable lady died
in Sydney the other day—was an absent-
minded hardshell. When he finally left Aus-
tralia for England in IS4B he forgot all
about £3OO in the Barrack-street Savings
Bank ; and probably it would have lain there
until this day had not somebody taken pity
on the little man when disaster struck him
at the time the land-boom smashed. Renwick
was able to prove his wife’s claim, and the
accumulations came in very handy indeed.
John Saunders, by the way, was lawyer as
well as parson. He was the first shepherd
of the first Baptist flock in Australia, and
opened a tabernacle behind St. Andrew’s
Cathedral in 1835.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” : The Mayor of
Balmain told Governor Davidson at a func-
tion last week that Governor Hunter sold
Balmain to Dr. Balmain for five shillings.
Wrong. The site of the now populous
suburb was a free grant to Balmain; and
when the latter w r as going back to England
he thought so little of it that lie sold it to a
medical friend in India for 10 shillings. The
friend did not hold it, either, but cut it up
and sold it in lumps.
Daniel Harvey Hogan, of Brunswick
(Vic.), who came in 1852 as an A.B. on the
Fantome and has just died a Sunday-school
superintendent at 84, was one of the blue-
jackets who marched from Melbourne to
Ballarat to suppress the Eureka rising.
Adam Forsyth, the cheerful money-spinner
who had been looking after the odd ha’penny
all his life, and got most of his joy of life
out of it —for many years past he was one of
the chiefs of Burns- Philp’s—left £311,000
behind him. An old bachelor, most of his
wealth goes to nephews and nieces in Scot-
land ; but he scattered Australian bequests
liberally-—gave £5OO apiece to most of the
working heads, in B.P.’s and to numerous
friends, £lOOO to Colonel Burns to do what
he likes with, enough for a new cottage at
the Burnside Homes, which he had already
helped, though in his lifetime it was almost
the unpardonable sin to say that he had
opened his purse for anything.
Billjim in Egypt lost a good and remark-
able friend when Baroness Wentworth, better
known as Lady Blunt, Byron’s grand-
daughter, died a few weeks ago in Cairo.
She learnt drawing from Ruskin, excelled in
rapid sketching, was a mathematician and
linguist and a distinguished Arabic scholar.
She married Wilfred Blunt in ’69, and being
a great horsewoman accompanied lnm
through the wildest part of the Mesopo-
tamian and Arabian deserts. She inherited
the Wentworth barony, descending from her
grandmother, Lady Byron.
Robert Algie, 55, killed the other day by a
tram on St. Kilda-road, was one of Colonel
Tom Price’s instructors during the years
when the Vic. Government was training its
Mounted Riflemen. In those times Algie
\Jas in charge at Hamilton, where he
straightened the backbone of many a gay
young squatter-spark and nailed in the right
idea of duty. The news of his passing will
be received with sorrow by many a soldier
in far fields.
“T. 0.1.”: The Minister who secured the
removal of the names of James Dalton,
Michael Casey and Pat Burke from the roll of
J’s.P. (B. 14/3/’IS), on the occasion of
John Redmond's visit to Australia, was
Francis Abigail, still living, though sub-
merged by the failure of his ridiculous
“bank” a quarter of a century ago. The
address which they signed contained a state-
ment that Ireland was governed by a foreign
monarch. James Dalton, whose half-sister
John Redmond married, is the survivor of
the group, aged 84.
" Morris, the innocent cause of the Metho-
dist strike at Hindmarsh (S.A.), has tried to
cut the knot by enlisting, but has been
turned down. Grounds : “Poor physique and
generally unsuitable.” So he has to go back
to a pulpit; but whether it. will be his old
one or the new one to which “Conference”
has assigned him. isn’t settled. The officials
of his old chapel declare that the congrega-
tion “will be a dead letter” unless they get
their anti-Conscriptionist.
A noted Westralian goldfields man, Bob
Alderson, was killed in France lately. Pri-
vate Alderson was a few years ago the prin-
cipal owner of the rich Neta mine, at Edju-
dina, and carried out in his spare time a
multitude of public duties, being, among
other things, the dentist of the waybaek camp.
The dentist's chair was a sturdy mulga,
in the fork of which the victims rested their
necks, a bolt being fixed across to prevent
withdrawal while Bob went to work with
instruments made on the anvil of the mine
smithy. Later, he acquired a modern kit
and put many a job through with the finish
of an expert. Ultimately, he was made a
J.P., and the first offender dealt with was
an old mate. The conviction was summary,
for the evidence of the prosecuting constable
—a black eye and sundry other disruptions
—was beyond explaining away. “I’ll fine
you a quid,” said his Worship, sternly.
“Blime, Bob, ain’t you a bit strong?” the
culprit wailed. “Hang it all, Billy,” ex-
claimed the presiding SoTon, “you don t
think the blanky dough is for me ; it’s for
the Guv-ment.” Bob, in the soothing atmo-
sphere of the adjacent pub, afterwards
refunded the quid and there was harmony
again. A great-hearted man was Bob Aider-
son.
0. A. Bernays, Clerk of Queensland
Parliament, has written a short history of

of them, are so good that, wanting more,
one wishes Etiquette had been in recess.

“Leg Bail” : I came across a woman whose
husband had deserted her and her child,
levanting to the West. She had written to
John Madden as Chief Justice begging him
to tell her, she being
without friends and
a stranger in Vic-
toria, what she could
do. I saw the old
Chiefs letter in re-
ply ; he expressed
liis regrets that de-
serted wives without
money could not
“bring such scoun-
drels back from
neighboring States
to jus t i c e,” and
asked her to accept
the £2 2s. he sent for
her little one’s sake.
Later on something
evidently stirred in
his mind, for he sent
her another cheque
for fl Is., and hoped
she was doing bet-
ter. He never saw
the woman.

In a recent list of Westralians killed in
France was the name of one whom insiders
knew as the daring spirit responsible for
the big gold “lift” from the Bullfinch mine
in the height of the boom. With the whole
surface on the qui vive, some £4OOO worth
of metal (the monthly clean-up) suddenly
vanished, and the plant was never located.
It was in the adjacent mulga and was dis-
posed of much later on when the jaded
sleuths withdrew from the hunt. The sus-
pected marauder, as brave a man as ever
lived, died leading his men on, for he had
won his way to officer rank and also held a
medal for valor.
They are hardy old chaps in the country
where the Federal capital should be. At the
Bombala Show recently, Edward Irill, a
Snowy River youth of 73, with a wonderful
seat in the saddle, competed in the high
jumps.
“0.K.”: Lord Brassey’s habit of drinking
“colonial” beer in out-of-the-way pubs was
doubtless the outcome of his inborn disposi-
tion to mix with “common people.” There
is a tradition that his father, Tom Brassey,
began life as a navvy, but as a matter of
fact he sprang from ancient English yeoman
stock, and started his career in a surveyor's
office. Thus he came to be a railway con-
tractor when railways were, new to the
world. Ultimately he and his partner em-
ployed 75,000 navvies on contracts amount-
ing to £35,000,000, and he was in close and
sympathetic touch with the working-man
and his beer, and was full of appreciation
of the value of both, when the future Lord
Brassey was born.

next to his British D.S.O. and Belgian Ordre
de la Couronne. This unusual youth, who
is not yet 2G, is one of Colonel Bob Owen’s
bright pupils, and succeeded to the charge

From the neighborhood of Petrograd: —
Enter Madame Kollontay, the first of her sex to
hold Cabinet rank. She is a Bolshevik and any
other old thing that assures Liberty even at the
expense of Equality and Fraternity, and her coif-
fured head is crowded with languages, economic
statistics, and various arts and sciences. It is
said that she entered the Bolshevik Cabinet at the
invitation of Lenin, but to assume that Lenin was
alone responsible would be showing scant respect
for her character and charms. She is a rather
pretty woman, who has employed a corsetiere to give
every advantage to her flowing lines. She has also
big, dark' eyes that have room for other expressions
beside indignation with the bourgeoisie. The sight
of this perfectly-shod and manicured lady in the
phantom frocks and frillies of a pre-war mannequin
would appear rather grotesque at a Soviet discus-
sion, but her comrades found her lusciousness com-
patible with the highest revolutionary aspirations.
For some years she did good work for her party in
Switzerland, and out-distanced the most advanced
by headlining marriage among her list of things
anathema. The lady, who is a little over 30, divorced
her own husband some time ago. Before she became
a Bolshevik she was a school-teacher in a village
not far from where Mrs. Sukhomlinoff, wife of the
notorious ex-Minister of War, started putting her
beauty to use.

This is a holding co., its assets consisting
almost exclusively of the shares in the British
Australasian Tobacco Co. (which combines
the Cameron and part of the Dixson busi-
nesses), the States Tobacco Co. (which in-
cludes the tobacco and cigar businesses of
Sutton and Co. and Jacobs, Hart and Co. and
the other part of the Dixson business) and
W. D. and 11. O. Wills (Australia). The
amalgamation was effected in 1903; but it
was not until the last few years that Aus-
tralian investors came freely into the huge
concern, which has a (i p.c. cumulative" pref.
capital of £1,484,727 and an ordinary capital
of £4,000,000, of which £3,750,300 is issued
—all £1 shares. The cos. whose shares this
co. holds have an independent existence; but
they don’t publish their proceedings to the
world, or even to the shareholders in the
holding co. The latter doesn’t even say pre-
cisely what the aggregate dividends received
amount to: it exhibits all its income in one
leap—“ Direct net profits and dividends,”
which for last year were £555,314.
This, it will be noticed, is £15,771
less than the profits shown in the
table. That amount hasn’t gone in
management exes, (these are not disclosed,
being apparently deducted from the profits).
but is money used by the directors in
purchasing shares for the benefit of em-
ployees. During the past four years the
additions to capital in consequence of these
purchases have been :
1914 .. ..£33,536 I 1916 .. ..£32,285
1915 . . . . 38,708 | 1917 . . . . 15,771
This makes a total of £120,300 in the four
years, and means an addition of nearly
£15,000 a year to the wages of the participa-
ting employees. The reduction in the amount
handed to the trustees for the past year is
apparently the result of reduced net earnings
by the co'. The “direct net profits and divi-
dends” have moved back from £577,239 in
the year ended January, 1910, to £509,259 in
the following year, to £555,314 in the year
just passed. This is an English co., and
probably the falling away is due to heavier
taxation. At any rate, the fact that the
employees got only about half the usual
bonus is likely to take some of the sharp
edge off the cry that is bound to go up over-
last week’s rise in the price of tobacco. True,
the co. doesn’t guarantee any profit-sharing
distribution: tlier thing is purely experimen-
tal. and is, presumably, only to be continued
so long as the management finds that it pays.
In most cases an employee can benefit after
two years’ service—provided lie (or she)
doesn’t draw a salary of £250 or more a year.
After five years he can sell the shares, if he
wants tobut as he is getting 12 p.c. he
mostly doesn’t want to. After eight years
the shares, which until then are held, by
trustees, go on to the register in the name of
the employee: they are his absolutely. Tak-
ing the present value of shares the employees’
interest in the business is now worth very
nearly a quarter of a million, all accumu-
lated in. say. five years; and a holding of
that size ought to make the employees feel
personally interested. Also it is certainly not
going to make the Labor politician any more
eager to nationalise the business.

The record harvest for the past year has
been gathered out of a fool's paradise. The
oldest inhabitant cannot recall a- time when
the community seemed more prosperous. The
fact that we are on a gorgeous burst with a
p.n. apparently worries nobody—least of all
the politicians. The average citizen might
better realise the position if one bright morn-
ing he awoke and found this under his
door: —

P.S. —Note that each of your dependants owes a
similar amount, and that you are responsible for and
have to meet their obligations as well as your own.
P.P.S. —A settlement of portion of above amount
will be necessary at an early date.
That was something like the actual position
of every Cornstalk as at Dec. SI last. And
to pay for our part in the war another £1
goes on the bill every five weeks.
Because of the splashing of loan money,
the magnificent prices we are getting for
many of our products, and the consequent
high wages, Gordon’s, who run a big cash-
order business in conjunction with a number of
retailers, as well as a cash and t.p. furnishing
business of their own. have naturally been get-
ting fat. The cash-order business is a lucrative
one; Gordon’s will lend you up to a fiver
to purchase goods for “cash” in other shops.
The co. receives Is. in the £ for 20 weeks’
accommodation. That charge would be equal
to 13 p.c. p.a.. even if there were no repay-
ments by instalments. With weekly repay-
ments it is nearer 30 p.c.; but out of that the
co. has to pay collecting and book-keeping
exes. Also it has to cover bad debts, which,
however, are surprisingly few. Neverthe-
less, the co, makes provision for the bad
marks by reserving a proportion of the
profits:—

1917 15,895 14,571
But look at the foot of the first table and
you will see that the co. is about to dis-
tribute £20,000 to shareholders; and note
also that it is only three years since £40,000
was ladled out in the same way. That means
that the directors have more than provided
for all contingencies in the past, and that
they have been able to give shareholders the
benefit of things having turned out right.
The balance-sheet is not over-illuminative.

The first-column figures now represent this
conglomerate: “Leasehold property, war
loan, debentures, mortgages, shares in other
cos., cash in hand and on deposit at short
call, stock on hand, fittings, plant, etc.”
The co.’s holding of property is big, and
altogether they are a healthy-looking lot of
assets. About the “sundry debtors” item,
The Bulletin hesitates to make compari-
sons with earlier years in the matter of
advances to customers, as it is not unlikely
that there was a certain amount of cash
formerly included in the item. Anyhow,
five years ago, when £24,423 of profit was
made, sundry debtors owed £103,431 ; last
year an increased profit of £6OOO was made
with the sundry debtors item reduced by
over £20,000. Undoubtedly the co. lias built
up a very fine business. Whether it can
maintain with safety the present turnover
in the dull days ahead is very doubtful. But
if it can do half as well it will still show
very excellent figures.

The directors say that the profit in each of
the last three terms has been an exact £5OOO
—just enough to pay the dividend —“after
making provision for depreciation, etd., etc.”
The additional profits shown in the table
arc- the total amounts by which the reserve,
insurance and dividend equalisation funds
have been increased. These have moved as
follows: —
Dec., ’l6. June, ’l7. Dee., ’l7.
Reserve fund .. £42,158 £47,458 £47,458
Insurance fund . . 20,000 20,000 22,000
Dividend equalisation 4,300
The additions to the Insurance Reserve may
not be all true profit, because the co. carries
its own Workmen’s Compensation risks: but
it is pretty obvious that the amount credited
to Dividend Equalisation Reserve is regarded
as good honest lay-by. In addition something
of unknown dimensions is written off against
depreciation. No idea of this sum can
be got by comparing the mine capital
account, because during the past two years
the co. lias been spending a lot of money in
opening up the Pelton mine at Maitland and
supplying it with a railway. The latter is
now completed. At December, ’l5, just after
the co. had Bought this freehold, assets other
than mine, buildings, plant and rolling stock
were £36,435 net. Notwithstanding the
surplus profit earned meantime and the
money derived from the sale of surface
lands the corresponding figures are now
£17,323. This means that the funds have
been cut into by less than £20,000 to provide
the new mine ; but a good deal of money will
still have to he spent there. Considering
th(> bumps that the coal business has had
since the war started, the Wallsend share-
holders have nothing to feel very unhappy
about.

Owing to better results from the residential
side of the business the directors managed
to squeeze out a profit despite bigger bills for
provisions and wages. But the figures are
still disappointing. When the co. set out to
establish a first-class residential pub—-the
Pacific-—on the Manly beach, everything
seemed rosy. The promoters, working on
1010 figures, reckoned on an annual profit of
about £7400 after allowing for £2OOO or so
for depreciation and smashages. The net
profit for the past five years has not aver-
aged a sixth of the estimate. Just when the
Pacific was becoming known to the right
Class of customers the war intervened ; then
six o’clock closing followed and knocked holes
in bar receipts: and all the time the spectre
of increasing costs played grab with the bed
and tucker profits. All the shareholders
have got so far has been one 5 p.c. div. Mean-
time the cash position has been moving this
way:—

As written down the fixed assets are about
£6OO less than they were five years ago; so
if the allowance for wear and tear, renewals,
etc., has been ample the co. is about £5OOO
better off than it was as at December, 1912.
Capital is £35,000, in fully paid £1 shares;
there are debentures totalling, with interest,
£20,202 ; and the co. is leaning on the bank
for £5594. After the others have been fed,
there is only a rare crumb left for share-
holders under present trading conditions.

This co, sold its business for an interest in
the Combine when the latter was formed some
years ago, and its brewery and malthouse pro-
perty at Abbotsford has ever since been on
its hands. Since the close of the financial
year, however, the directors say, they have
reopened negotiations for a sale and expect
that one will he effected, and they would
hardly uncork that much if the business wasn’t
almost as good as clinched. Apart from that
asset, which has been written down from
£40.000 to £16,000, the co. owns shares with
a face value of £70.1-5 in the Combine and
£8094 in cash, hotel property (£2609) and
sundries. The war hasn’t done the Com-
bine any good, mainly because of the early
closing for which it was made the pretext.

During this period it has put £0025 into
pref. shares, so the deterioration is really
a bit worse than it looks. In the past year
it improved a little, as the result of the in-
creased prices arranged with Mr. Bung;
hut the outlook for the Trade is by no means
brilliant, because the prospects of restoring
the old hours to the beer-pump seem to be
growing steadily worse. The Liberal party
certainly won’t take Bung to its bosom,
because its women supporters won’t let it;
and though in Queensland the Labor party
is on very good terms with the Trade, else-
where some of the Trade's most militant
opponents —in N. S. Wales, for instance —
are in the forefront of Labor.

In seven years the co. has got £28,383 fur-
ther into debt; but it has put more than
£41,000 into premises and plant and has
about £15,700 more in floating assets. It is
quite possible that at £07.265 the fixed assets
are over-valued : but there is no doubt what-
ever that fhe freehold and equipment (the
principal premises are in llarris-street, and
are very valuable apart from the ice and
refrigerating plant) are worth very many
thousands more than they were seven years
ago. In other words, though the £30.000 or
thereabouts added to the nominal reserves
during the past seven years may not be all
undivided net profit, a good deal of it is;
and that is an astonishing performance on a
live share capital of only £1462.

(arrived at by agreement) and made retro-
spective. The increase in working exes,
due to this wages adjustment will. it. seems,
amount to something over £lO,OOO a year.
This, unless other economies can be made,
will cut down the surplus on working
account far too low to allow of proper pro-
vision being made for a sinking fund and
replacements. The figures in this working
•account have moved as follows: —
Expenditure
Revenue, (inc. Interest). Surplus.

The renewals fund is not invested wholly
apart from the business; but advances made
out of that fund to the undertaking have to
pay interest to it. The sinking fund is
unsatisfactory in that it is not of a general
character, but applies only to one loan.
No new line was opened during the year, but
an extension was in progress. There was on
tin* old lines some extra traffic, unfortu-
nately at an increased cost which almost ate

Last year’s was the heaviest bill per mile
since the Trust began. But circumstances
are quite abnormal. Apart from the wages
bill, which may or may not be cut down
when the cost of living becomes normal, there
have been extraordinary increases in the
prices of many of the Trust’s necessary com-
modities. Engineer Dix quotes a few (com-
parisons are witli 1914) : Steel tyres. 191
p.c.; car lamps, 172 p.c.; bar iron. 153 p.c.;
copper wire, 100 p.c.; white lead, 84 p.c.;
oil and grease, 04 p.c. ; cotton waste, 00 p.c.
—and so on. In all the circumstances the
surplus may be regarded as satisfactory. It
ought to be twice as large, of course, in
order to make proper provision for the future
and for the repayment of capital; but as the
Trust, isn’t in the kind of business in which
extra costs can be passed on, it is doing as
well as could reasonably be expected. But
there shouldn’t be any talk of concessions
until it does a great deal better.
From a trustworthy man in the business :
The N. S. Wales coal-miner is in a rebellious mood,
and it is foolish not to recognise it. AVe shall be
in trouble if we don’t. Mostly it is on the question
of the owners’ refusal to re-employ a certain num-
ber of alleged leaders after'the recent big disturbance.
Some of these men, exercising something akin to
hypnotic influence over their mates, exulted in lay-
ing a mine idle over some trivial matter that a
level-headed man would have adjusted in five minutes.
These men are out for sabotage and such-like madness.
No sane community can have any sympathy for these
dangerous fools. But it is equally true that some
of the men are now out of work for no other reason
than that they kept the managers up to the mark in
observing awards—in the payment of full com-
pensation to men working in deficient places, for
instance. As a result of the removal of these spokes-
men, miners in some pits have to take whatever the
bosses offer them, and if they protest they are
reminded that the alternative is 14 daj's’ notice.
The pendulum of domination has swung from one
side to the other. This was exemplified at the
recent conference, when Baddeley (for the em-
ployees) objected to the stand-and-deliver attitude
of the. proprietors, and Morgan (for the employers)
reminded him that it was not so long since he
(Baddeley) was in that position. The one and only
solution of these recurring snarls is the annihilation
of the contract system and the substitution of an
adequate daily wage. A man would then be able
to look his mate in thc#6ye without mentally calcu-
lating the tonnage he was filling or how he fared
with the boss in the matter of compensation.
Baker’s Creek, Hillgrove (N.S.W.), is in
the market again after a liquidation and
years of travail. A float was pulled off in
Melbourne per broker Moore to test a small
reef got by the tributors at 1700 ft.. some-
where west of the run of the old Baker’s
Creek reef. That was a narrow shoot of
stone out of which Adelaide snicked £250.000
in divs. in the sweet long ago. Latest bul-
letins from No. 17 level read like old times:
winze down on soz. stone, stope on 2]oz.,
No. 16 level winze on 3oz. But it takes a
lot of Bin. stone to make a ton ; nevertheless
the mine is so well opened up that it may
have another brief lease of life.

Welcome to the Vie. Mines Department,
Sam Barnes, of Walhalla. The Hon. Sam
is a lean slab of a mountaineer, who, after
Dawson chucked up mine-managing the
Long Tunnel, got the job. Besides being
a good miner Barnes is a good fellah, with
as many yarns at call as ever had old L. L.
Smith. Of course, coming from Walhalla,
they may not be equally nutty, but if one
can last till 3 a.m. with Barnes, one will
learn that they have a flavor of their own.
Barnes’s electorate has the M’orwell brown
coal open-cut in it, so that long-suffering
industry may at last get a move on. That
the London-owned Melbourne Electric Co.
has put up. the costs of lighting and power
10 p.c. to users should hearten Barnes to
the job of turning Morwell to account.

There isn't anything in the half-year’s re-
ports of Duke Extended, Ararat (Vic.), to
suggest that divs. are any closer than they
were six months ago. Receipts amounted to
only £OO2O, and of that £2409 came from
calls. The 931-joz. won from 530
fathoms was dug from the run of
wash west *of Nos. 1 and 2 rises
into which panellers were put early this year.
Of .course, dirt of that grad® will soon clean
up debts; but east of the main crosscut the
ground is patchy and mostly on the poor side.
There has been a bit of a hustle to get work
done to the west by pushing out the inter-
mediate from No. 2 rise, but the gutter has
split or there is a blimp in the reef from
150 ft. to 357 ft. Beyond that point is 60ft. of
wash which isn't worth taking out. though
it is said to be “strong, well water worn and
of. good appearance.” In all the western
drives the wash has gone underfoot, so a
branch reef drive is being rushed ahead to
get under the western ground. There a rise
will soon tell the flavor of the dirt. The
cash sunk by the co. so far amounts to
£80,843, without a cent of return to share-
holders. Bold won has brought only £40,451,
leaving £35,632 to be forked out by investors
for calls. This is the way all alluvial mining
goes in the Cabbage Garden these days.
“Dodger”: The idea of George Bryant and
Jimmy Maekay to shut down on extraction
work at the Langi Logan (Vic.) isn’t shap-
ing well. Judd and Little, of the A.M.A.,
saw that it meant scrapping a lot of alluvial
workers, and fired a writ into Maekay invit-
ing him to attend the Federal Arbitration
Court. Little’s stiff job is to prove that the
co. has been responsible for a lock-out. Both
New and South Langi have been sinks for
cash, and a number of the wise-heads unload
shares every time prices spurt. Should the
Court agree with Little, what is to happen to
the no-liability cos. that are on the call
list and probably have plant in pawn? Any-
how, every mining tyro knows that the only
chance the Langi shows have is to drain the
gutter and work on cheap lines with a big
staff. If Little could produce 150 efficients
he would earn a vote of thanks.
Cardross copper-field (Q.), where the
Mammoth Co. unfolded its wings just before
the war, is very quiet now. The pumps were
withdrawn from the co.’s main mine, the
Chieftain, before Christmas, and a few men
put on to work the small lensical Caledonia.
Bunches of nice ore are obtained, but if
this co. intends to become a producer it
must concentrate on the Chieftain. Except
for a 48 hours’ smelt, the blast furnace has
not been worked since the war started, and
the bit of good grade ore gouged out of the
oxidised zone of the Chieftain was sold to
southern smelters. To allow water to rise
in a mine and have to pump it out every
time operations are restarted makes a big
hole in profits.
The old Vulcan, Irvinebank (Q.), reckons
it is on the scent of something good, a bit of
nice stone being located in the vicinity of
the 500 ft. level. Otherwise the outlook is
very sick. Deep prospecting yielded blanks
mostly, so operations have been transferred
to the upper levels.
Mt. Petersen, at Irvinebank (Q.), is being
cleaned out by old John Moffat’s co., which is
going to give the big lode a trial. Its
backers reckon it will go It p.c., and with
tin at its present high price that will pay.
An aerial ropeway has been installed to pro-
vide cheap transport to the mill. Irvinebank
needs nourishment of some sort. It is very
weak.
* * * *
Stannary Hills (Q.) comes to light again
as a result of the high price of tin. Its mill
at Rocky Bluffs is being put into order for
crushing, and once more the co. "will be on
the list of producers. Development work on
the Arbouiu mine has revealed big bodies
worth about 4 p.c.—enough, it is reckoned,
to keep the mill going for three years.
Arsenic mines are becoming the fashion in
the Chillagoe district (Q.). One syndicate
is pegging out wholesale. The other day
there was a flutter up Koorboora wav, and
some shows were taken up which showed
nearly 50 p.c. on assay. The blows are near
the railway and could be easily handled
But nobody comes to light with a plant for
treatment purposes. Yet the State Mines
Department is working ore much poorer as
regards arsenical contents and reckons to
make big profits out of it.
* * * *
From D. Mackey, late manager:—
Wild Oat par. (B. 28/2/’18), commenting on New
tommy Burns (N.Q.), says “the No. 3 tunnel was
continued 125 ft., but it only proved that the tin
ore sunk on in the deep winze did not live to
depth/’ This tunnel (555 ft. in length) was driven
from the eastern side of the hill and would have to
go another 4Oft. to be plumb under the winze, which,
by the way, was not in ore of any importance for
the last 40 or 50 feet. The undoubted trend of the
Burns main ore-body was westward, and the tunnel
would require to go at least a further 200 or 300 feet
to prove anything much about it. Present pro-
gramme is to connect winze with tunnel for pass and
ventilation and try for the continuation of the ore-
body nearer to where it was lost.
As at December 31 the co. owed £07!) to
sundry creditors and £558 on account of
Government subsidy; on the other side,
apart from mine, plant and a trifle of stores,
it had under £—-)—not much more than was
Paid in diva, per share on the old issue.
Three or four years ago about £3OOO worth
of insured gold was stolen by masked men
from under the nose of the Bullfinch man-
agement. The insurance co. declined to pay
out, and the Board went to Jaw. The case
was heard in London, where the co. lately
won a verdict for £2780 and costs.
After paying £140.000 in dividends. Golden
Ridge (W.A.) has decided to give up. The
Board has been authorised to dispose of the
assets, and voluntary liquidation is to fol-
low.
Tyrconnell North (W.A.) has taken op-
tions on several has-beens at the north end
of the Kalgoorlie field, and is now consider-
ing what it will do with them. Included in
the number is the Hidden Secret, which once
had a rich shoot of telluride; the Fair Play,
from which several small rich crushings were
taken years ago; and the North End, which
once enriched a couple of prospectors but
afterwards ruined a eo. The Tyrconnell
Crowd is also busily developing a formation
exposed some time ago in a cutting on the
East-West line, near Kalgoorlie, and has
already begun to blow about prospects.
With both eyes on the market Princess
Royal has installed a plant on its* Happy
Jack option at Comet Vale (W.A.) and
Adelaide is being advised to get in early.
But it should look before it leaps. It wouid
he interesting to know why the last half-
yearly report contains no report from the
manager, and also whether the option was
exercised against the advice of the local
director, Herbert Moss, who controls the
adjacent Sand Queen mine and should know
something about the field.
* * * *
Great Boulder’s ore reserves are now esti-
mated at 387.511 tons containing 270.731
fine ounces. This is a big drop compared with
the previous year’s figures— s6o.647 tons
containing 416.2650 Z. To date the co. has
paid over 51 millions sterling in dividends,
and will probably distribute another million
before the blind is pulled down.
The cash position of the Mararoa ( W.A.)
is stronger than its ore reserves. Below No.
7 level things look pretty sick, though there
are blocks of stone north and south at No. 8
to be. beaten out. This has to he sweetened
np with what quartz can be got in the far
north workings of Nos. 5 and 6 levels and
the No. 7 intermediate. Here manager Hen-
derson has prodded round till he has satisfied
all and sundry that the shoot of stone
lives only a few feet above No. 6 and below
No. 7. level. So he has only about 60ft. of
material to stope. which means hard graft to
keep going. Under the circs, he won’t
chance estimating the reserves. Still it looks
as if he has Is. 6d. available, and as there is
2s. cash in hand apart from the plant the
risk of holding shares need not fluster any-
one.
* * * *
The Tasmanian Government proposes to
snend about half a million in damming th.'
King River, and developing power. Mount
By ell has guaranteed to become a big cus-
tomer. But before undertaking the work,
the Government is, with unusual caution,
spending a few hundreds on deviating the
stream to'discover whether the bed is too
permeable to admit of the project being suc-
cessful. Generally this sort of question isn't
asked until ail the money has been spent.
* * * *
If Mount Stewart (Tas.), which the
Mount Jasper Co. has visions of floating off,
doesn t do any better for the new people
than it. has done for the old, nobody will get
tiit Picked samples have given from 40oz. to
•).)oz. silver, trace to 6gr. gold, 9 to 22 p.c.
lead and 10 to 17 p.c. zinc. But in the last
working, the south drive which was extended
150 ft. from the shaft at 200 ft., the values
taken every sft. were 240 z. silver, trace to
ogr. gold, 1 to 7 p.c. lead and 5 to 11 p.c.
zinc. The lode was 43in. wide in one place;
but what the new people ought to make sure
about is whether width doesn’t mean lean-
ness. There are some very fine streaks of
galena : and it will be important to ascer-
tain what the silver values are outside the
streaks.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, March 25, 1918.
My Dear Akjni,—
The Fullerton Memorial Hall in Crown-
street housed the crowd which heard the
annual report of the Women’s Hospital over
the road. Bunting fluttered from pillar to
post, and the platform was packed with hos-
pital officials, Judge Backhouse in the midst
of them as chairman. Governor Davidson
talked a little, while his lady nursed the
committee’s presentation posy. Dr. Mac-
kellar warmed up to his favorite theme, the
saving of child life, and plucked statis-
tics from a sheaf of papers. David Storey
and others took up the cudgels for hospitals,
David pausing to throw a pebble at the
Goliaths who accept the baby bonus. Nellie
Leach, who organised the big matinee for. the
Crown-street haven, got a word of thanks.
She crept under the shade of her hat. Her
neighbor, Mrs. Kelly, who had only a toque
to hide her blushes, had a similar compli-
ment paid her.
The carnival to help the Alexandra Hos-
pital for Children was quite off the track.
For this the committee has to thank the
theatricals who provided th& meat of the
show. Enormous kewpies, with humans
perspiring inside, strutted across the sunlit
Sydney Cricket Ground. “The Bing Boys”
played cricket with fancy teams from the
National and Tivoli. A huge crowd, with (I
guessed this) millions of children, filled the
grandstand and piled up against the fences
round the oval. Organiser Clarence Moss,
secretary of the Hospital, can shake hands
with himself.
The concert arranged by the Town Hall
staff to help the Mayor’s Patriotic Fund
didn’t get enough publicity. Good works
alone won’t draw the multitude, and the
attendance was not large. The sub-regal
party, which is going hard, came along, and
surrounded the leather-chair reserve in
good order. Captain Glossop and his bride
were in this selection. The usually dismal
organ platform was a bower of tall palms
from which, to start off with, the excellent
Metropolitan Band gave a fine performance.
Charles Smythe, Carrie Lanceley (in rose
pink and white lace), John Lemmone, A. E.
Benham, and a rich-voiced contralto, Lilian
Gibson, were in a programme that was as
long as this day week.
Nancy Chisholm, good Red Cross worker,
was married last week in All Saints’, Wool-
lahra. The hero was Ivan Young, of Nliill
(Vic.) and the Flying Corps. Youthful Mar-
garet and Val. Stephen walked sedately to
the altar behind Aunt Nancy. Sister Joan
“attended” the dainty bride, who was frocked
in silky-white georgette, with a Limerick lace
veil over all. Bishop Langley, aged 80-
something, came over the border to help at
the knot-tyinsr of his pet niece. The Sendalls
from Goulburn, and some of the Youngs of
Nhill, were at the party. The flying man
gave Nancy a badge of his corps, the wings
of diamonds and the letters “A.F.C.” in
enamel across the body. Other presents
included a carved oak-tray and a basket
woven with the ’groom’s colors from the Red
Cross spinning depot.
Next to Dr. Morrison, W. 11. Donald, a
one-time Victorian pressman of charming
personality, is the best-known Australian in
China and one of the most influential white
men in the big straggly republic. He edits a
paper and a very authoritative magazine, and
is correspondent for several big English and
American journals. “Donald,” says a recently
returned wanderer, “is still young and fresh-
looking, considering his years in the land
where the pace is usually swift. Not
always, of course, and the Victorian says he
can’t remember ever having tasted alcohol.”
Died at Krawaree a few weeks ago, Mrs.
B. Mackey, aged 85 —33 years, almost to a
day, after the death of her husband. Born
in Ireland, Bridget Nicholson came to Syd-
ney in ’54, and spent 10 years here as pri-
vate teacher. Married in ’64 to the late
Daniel Mackey, she went with him to a selec-
tion at Krawaree, 32 miles from Braid-
wood. The struggle in that bushland was
enlivened by visits from bushrangers led by
the Clarks; but they took nothing, perhaps
because there was so little to take. The
selector-pedagogue—Dan studied for his
schoolmaster’s job by the light of a bramble
fire, with a blanket wrapped round in the
bitter winter nights of those highlands—was
only bailed up once. That was when he was
travelling to Araluen. The bushrangers
emerged suddenly from their hiding-place,
but only to ask news of the world they had
left behind. The only eligible in the Mackey
family is a grandson who is for the present
helping at the Records Office in London.
Our girls are capturing an occasional
Sammy. In December at Norfolk, Virginia,
Lieut. Elisha Converse. National Naval
Volunteers < Boston), laid his worldly goods
at the feet of Lilian, a daughter of the late
W. Buckland Taylor, of Queensland.
Mrs. Moyes. wife of Major Moyes—she
was Nina Edmond, eldest daughter of James,
The Bulletin’s old chief, a very much less-
sick man in latter days, by the way—has
reached London and her wounded husband
safely. The Australian was twice damaged
in Flanders, the second wound involving the
loss of a foot. Meanwhile the Edmond
family, after getting progress cables of the
daughter’s voyage as far as St. John’s, had
an anguished bout of silence. Finally news
was received, through the Government ser-
vice, of the wanderer’s arrival. This took
only two days on the journey. On March
18 came a message which had started on
February 1 from London. It was a very
lame cable on landing, by reason of 45 days’
hard travelling. As it hadn’t come by the
Government route, one can’t throw even half
a brick at Mr. Webster this time.
,Though he’d had many months of indif-
ferent health, the death last week of I)r.
George Lane Mullins, for many years a
colonel in the Army Medical Service, and
formerly of the Garrison Hospital, was unex-
pected. There’s warm and wide sympathy
for the devoted wife, who lias nursed a sick
man all the summer —mostly on the Moun-
tains.
There has been a buzz at the Royal Naval
House to farewell Miss Henderson, who has
been the pivot of the Sailors’ Wives Friendly
Union. Excellency Helen addressed the
company, and on its behalf handled the
heroine a silk umbrella, travelling clock, suit-
case and a sheaf of good wishes. The clock
will point the hour on the coming pilgrim-
age the lady takes as travelling sec. of
the Australian Board of Missions. “But I
daresay,” said her Ex., “Miss Henderson
will occasionally forget the heathen to come
and have a look at us.” Frantic applause
frqm the little things our sailors left behind
them. Mrs. Dunn and her helpers saw that
the tea-urn hissed at 4 o’clock.
Chaw. H. Bertie,
City Librarian, is
really the storied
glad dog with the two
tails. Both appen-
dages are so new
that he waves them
joyously before the
eyes of all comers.
One is the just-
opened Municipal
Library for Adults
in Queen Victoria
Building—it sheds
the “Markets” forth-
with. The other is
an airy adjacent
Children’s Library
—a long - deferred
Bertie dream come
true. The kiddies
heard about it, of course —their very own —
and surged round the doors while Mayor and
aldermen were puffing through the heavy-
weight function of introducing the adults
to their bookbindings. In the youngsters’
den the shelves are not quite full. “On the
water” is the ship that brings the full-and-
plenty to feed the juvenile mind. Two lady
librarians, specially chosen for the job, are
the custodians of this Mecca of youth.
“For every book in the Municipal
Library,” says the librarian, “there is a
reader. The same thing applies to the
youngsters. Some, of course, are athirst
for fiction —plentifully supplied—but many
of them ask for solid informative literature.
They come from both State and private
schools, eager to dip into the new treasure
trove.” The tall man with the slight stoop
—he has the bookworm shoulders—and the
true librarian’s love of his hoard, sits atop
of all the readers when he climbs into his
sanctum. This commands an unrivalled
view of city chimney-pots, with a distant
glitter when the western sun shines on the
shores of Watsoh’s Bay. “I was really born
in 1910,” there muses Chas. Bertie, “when
Syd Smith and I became the prophets of a
neglected god called ‘Old Sydney.’ The edition
quickly sold out. We tried the phblic again
with ‘Stories of Old Sydney.’ Since then
I have edited an Encyclopaedia of Australian
History. This is in pickle, waiting for the
end of the war. Edited ‘Aboriginalities’
from The Bulletin —and a discerning pub-
lic bought them. So with a ‘Story of Vau-
cluse House,’ which I put together last year.
Sold out.” City Librarian since 1909. Pre-
sident of Australian Historical Society,
1914. Went to Europe in 1913, making a
pilgrimage in search of remains of Governoi
Macquarie at Mull. Found a large hotel on
the island. Wondered how it paid. G°t tne
bill next day. Left Off wondering. Judith
Fletcher is responsible for the photo, of the
man himself.
The smile on this face rarely comes off.
Being merely general manager of the big
Broken Hill I’rop.,
which has built the
great iron and steel
works at Newcastle
and wanted to build
ships as soon as it
saw that Australia
needed them, he
hasn’t, of course,
any worries. G. D.
Delprat was born in
Holland ; but he left
early, and was in
Scottish engineering
works and then at
mines in Spain and
America before he
came to Australia
nearly 20 years ago.
I suppose he is
worried with about
the biggest salary paid in Australia;
but be wasn’t content to let his girls grow
up to be butterflies. Every one of them has
a profession—mostly medicine or music.
Carmen, the violinist, who “finished off” in
Europe, is one; another met Mawson, the
Arctic explorer, at Adelaide University and
married him later on ; a third, a doctor, is
just back from America. If Mr. Delprat
were asked what Australian women lack, lie
would first tell you suavely that they don’t
lack anything : if you pressed him he might
allow that higher education wouldn’t hurt
the °irls. For a little light recreation he
would as soon be set a problem in mathema-
tics as anything. They made him a some-
thing or other in the new Order of the
British Empire the other day. No, not a
knight. He is still plain Guillaume.
Governor Davidson declared the liorty
Society’s Autumn blooms well and truly
open, amidst an almost stifling incense from
the roses. The white whiskers of the Horty’s
chief enthusiast, 11. B. Bradley—a superb
crop—waved over the proceedings; and
Maiden, of the Botanic Gardens, guided his
Ex. round St. James’s Hall.
Mrs. Gil ruth, wife of the Northern Terri-
tory Administrator, has passed through Syd-
ney on her way to Melbourne. She got a
decoration in the recent shower that fell on
Red Cross workers.
John Madden was connected with the great
Sydney legal family of Stephen. This way.
The original John Stephen arrived in Sydney
in 1824 as Solicitor-General. He became a
Judge ; his son Alfred became Chief Justice,
and. his grandson, Mathew Henry (still
living), Judge and acting Chief Justice.
John I. had five sons and three daughters.
The eldest son, Sydney Stephen, became a
Judge in Maoriland ; his son, Francis John
Stephen, was a well-known Melbourne
solicitor, and one of his daughters John
Madden married.
One of the dailies the other day printed a
photo, of 85-year-old Captain William
Moseley, who at the moment was busy knit-
ting socks for soldiers. Moseley is an old
Army officer, Captain in the 60th Rifles,
with which he served in India. Getting out
of uniform he tried squatting in N. S. Wales
with a high percentage of poor luck. Having
married the daughter of a well-known Syd-
ney solicitor, Captain Moseley settled down
to study law, and in 1888, at the age of 55,
he was admitted to practice. For some
years thereafter the firm was Billyard,
Moseley and Andrews.
Another decorated young warrior stepped
ashore unannounced the other day. He is
Captain Stanley Calderwood, M.C., of an
infantrv battalion that has had a record of
tough work since Gallipoli. Well known in
the Galston district, lie was surveying when
the call came; and before embarking he
got special leave to sign up with May Tay-
lor, of a well-known Bathurst family. His
cantaincy and decoration were won in a hot
corner at Paschendaele. Sickness soon after-
wards added his name to the casualty lists.
Word comes in that Captain Brian Laid-
ley Dowling, of the Flying Cori.s, son of
solicitor Arthur Dowling, is engaged to an
English heiress. Mr. Dowling’s three sons
went to the Front. One was killed in
France; the other two are still plugging
away.
A gold wristlet watch and the best wishes
of her women-friends on the press went to
Rena Wallace the other afternoon. Mrs.
Holman handed over the token, and Rena
murmured her thanks behind a teardrop.
Tenor Cappelli is going to say good-bye to
Sydney before packing up the missus and
the baby to return to Italy. John Brownlow
manages the three swan songs in the Town
Hall, beginning April 1.
Soprano Lillian Mitchell, whose huskiness
at her opening concert in the Town Hall
was put down to nervousness and a cold,
had her tonsils removed last week by Hr.
Kirkland. '
Rose Gumming, one of Sydney’s erstwhile
champion raffle-ticket sellers, is putting tilt-
same push into the sale of V ar Loan Bonds
in Noo Yark. The good-looking Australian
is private sec. to a Mrs. Millionaire, and Mrs.
M. is, of course, nominally responsible tor
the swift sales. But the buyers, admit that
it’s the Sydney girl who cuts the ice.
It is not many years ago since ads. de-
signed in Australia were so bad that they
were used as examples of what not to do by
an advertising expert in the TJ.S.A. llow
far we have moved during the last decade
may be seen at the Commercial Artists’
show opened this week in the rooms of the
Ad. Men’s Club in Culwulla Chambers. The
exhibits comprise original drawings and
prints of newspaper ads., book illustrations,
catalogues, etc., from the studios of Walter
Jardine, Smith and Julius, W. Lassie, The
States Studio, Tom Ferry, Virgil Reilly and
others. The artistic standard of these draw-
ings is high, for most of them are the work
of men who have made good in what is for
the sake of distinction called fine art.
Surgeon-Major Donald, recently home from
active service, puts a circlet on the finger of
Dora Christoe this month. She’s a Hunter’s
Hill girl.
Some time last year (that ought to be
indefinite enough) a boat that passed through
the Panama Canal took a consignment of
Billjims from Australia, and this is how
Driver Jack Coffee, of Chatswood, describes
that part of the journey:—
As we pulled in the sides of the lock were lined
with American soldiers and canal officers and their
wives and daughters. They looked good to us: the
soldiers would do credit to any nation —trim and
neat in uniforms that fitted like gloves. There was
much cheering and exchanging of pieces of money,
badges and buttons.
At Trinidad, where “the people fed us with
cigarettes and fruits and expected to see us
black,” young Coffee remembered that Mr.
Baker, formerly Consul in Australia, was
located there; and that meant a re-union and
more pleasantness.
With the sparrows on the housetops will
presently be the only available lodgings dur-
ing the Easter crush. The city hums with the
invasion, and the extol days that tail on to
this year’s Show ada to the jingle in the
hostelries.
The Vagabond Club, which last year gave
a hand to many war funds, is getting ready
to do it again. It will flutter “Lady Win-
demere’s Fan” early in April; and there is
a rumor of something new from America
later, to say nothing of a Vagabond orches-
tra.
Sydney’s remarkable young accompanist
Aimde Puech is going to be married later on.
It’s a recent engagement. For the last few
years this young French-Australian pianist
has been a constant “at the piano” item.
She rarely opens a music score—-even when
the melodious voice of the Belgian Goossens
delights an audience, and Aimee Puech sup-
ports him in a repertoire that runs through
grand opera to the latest ballads.
Lieut.-Col. John Sherwood Kelly, D. 5.0.,
now adds the coveted V.C. ribbon. His wife
used to be Miss Greene, of landra.
The Carlyle Society, a hardy infant, has
had its christening in the Highland Society’s
rooms. Prof. MacCallum was godpa.
One of the Singleton Daltons, Harrie Sed-
ley, was married in England lately. The
bride was Mildred Irene Tansley, of
Palmer’s Green, who was given away by a
sister, father being at the war.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

It lias long been recognised that if a means could be
found to completely control tone color, a vital objection
to the Player Piano would be removed.
The entire Player Piano industry was groping and

The DUO-COYOERTO provides a complete control
Over the stroke of the piano hammer, and that is why this

My Dear Y aerie, —
The garden party at Government House
was charming. Autumn weather, a lovely
garden, clumps of very companionable people
and a good band—what more could you want?
Lady Stanley was 'tailored in tan, wore a
big black velvet liat tied under her chin, and
carried one of those huge decorated bags.
His Ex. wore a comfy grey lounge suit. (The
invitations curtly requested “sac suits.")
The decorative W. .T. T. Clarkes were there
—ltoma in black velvet. Dame Miller came
along with her newly-knighted Edward and
wore royal blue satin. Mrs. Reading and
Mrs. Macdonald from Sydney arrived with
the Norton Grimwades. The solemn (laud
Mayoral pair attended, Mrs. Stapley in her
black tailored silk.
Melbourne is over-run with delegates to
the fifteenth annual conference of the
Chambers of Commerce, hast week, before
the Melbourne taverns had cleared their
record batch of race visitors, some of the
delegates sat on the steps of Menzies’ and
refused to budge until a corner was found,
for them. The delegates have been meeting
and discussing ponderously in intervals of
protracted feeding. Dinners, lunches, sup-
pers and parties have been flung round to
them and their wives. The Stanleys gave a
garden party; there was a big soiree at the
Masonic and a crowd motored the lovely
beach road to tea at Frankston.
The show at the Masonic was an old
fogeys’ affair which recalled a country meet-
ing at “the Mechanics” or in the woolshed.
Tables were set on the floor of the big hall,
while a concert was hurled at the banqueters’
heads from the platform where Di Gilio had
his band. Mayor Stapley was a serious
guest, and his Mayoress reserved her musical
ear for the platform noises. Norton
Grimwade was another serious figure; his
wife was fluffed about with purple and laven-
der. Tom Murdoch, of the Tas. Marine
Board, brought his vivacious little wife. She
wore a black and white gown and a vivid
Egyptian-looking head-dress. Mrs. Meares,
from Sydney, caught the eye. And big Hugh
Y. McKay was there receiving congratu-
lations on his selection as one of the three
business men who are to keep an eye or two
on the Defence Department.
John Madden’s widow is leaving the
Cliveden flat to settle for a time in the
Frankston humpy. ' Daughter Lesley, being
tied to town, will step into a boarding-house
in South Yarra.
General Sellheim and his wife gave a fare-
well lunch party at Menzies’ to General
Johnston before his departure to New Guinea
and his new job of Administrator. Colonel
Kenneth Mackay came along for a handshake;
and Mrs. Johnston was there* in cool grey
toggery. She’s to be left behind,
Mrs. Willie Sharp is spending a quiet
time at Medlow trying to recover from the
shock of her husband’s death. He was head-
partner in the big timber firm and died sud-
denly from some heart trouble just after
finishing a game of golf.
Mrs. Alex. Gillespie, wife of the flour-
miller, has gone into hospital with a nervous
breakdown. Melbourne sassiety misses the
lady; she was an indefatigable hostess whose
“little dinners” were poems to the favored
Naicest.
Mrs. Masseran is back in Melbourne for a
brief visit. She has been in France and
enveloped in war work.
Mrs. Rogers Thomson gave a party to
introduce the Langham, the new swaggah
tea-and-bunnery run by the widow of Dr.
Kelly, of Ballarat. It’s all lavender and
lace, and Mrs. Thomson swamped her cor-
ner in roses.
Adela Pankhurst Walsh is a very subdued
young woman nowadays. With her able-
bodied seaman and his two daughters, who
adore their new stepma. she lives in a cot-
tage at Coburg, near the gaol, taken when
she was “doing time,” so that the family
might visit her as frequently and easily as
possible. Adela is an excellent cook, and, as
has frequently been noted with surprise, a
good-looker except when she has her mouth
wide 'open to shriek something foolish.
Domesticity seems to agree with her, for she
is a smiling, rosy-cheeked young wife.
Aide Conant has been holidaying in Tassy
with Captain Clifford. They fished at Lake
Leake.
The Desert Cold Lowrys of Maoriland
have fled from Melbourne to Sydney ; thence
they go home.
Mrs. George Higgins had a party at the
Quambv Club to meet an Adelaide visitor.
Mrs. Fisher, the guest of honor, runs the
Red Cross Record there. She is an old-
time Melbourne girl, a daughter of the late
Robert Sellar.
Vance Palmer having enlisted, his clever
wife Nettie (she used to be Nettie Higgins)
is going to give lessons and do coaching work
in French literature. Nettie is a ’Varsity
girl and was trained in France and Germany
for coaching work in languages. The lessons
will be arranged at her home in Sorrett-
avenue, Malvern, as the coach has two small
children to keep an eye upon. A phone
message will open up arrangements.
The Canadian Trade Commissioner has
quite a shopful of Red Indian goods left over
from Our Roys’ Day. He has them spread
out alluringly in his office —Indian baskets,
clothes, fur boots and beads, marked down to
cost price.
The Charlie Taits are due back this week
from America. Mrs. Charlie found the
weather conveniently freezing at the finish
of her visit and hubby came to the rescue
with some Alaskan furs. Brother Ted re-
turned a boat sooner, and is, established at
his Sydney post.
The whole Riverina Falkiner clan, off to
Sydney for the race season, are anticipating
a breathlessly gay time. The Easter frivols
will rage just as if the Hun were not taking
toll of the finest Australian manhood. But
we are sending across quite a consignment
of the other sort.
Cousin Adelaide drops in :
Red Cross workers are well to the fore in the
awards of the Order of the British Empire in this
State. Kathleen lvyffin Thomas, who was for some
time assistant-secretary and is now joint sec. with
Major Connor, is an officer,- while Mrs. George Dean
is a member. Other members are W. J. Isbister, for
a time hon. Commissioner in Egypt, and H. C. Cave,
who toiled as R.C.C. on Salisbury, Plains.
The cinematograph plant that the hotelkeepers
have presented to tire V.A.D.’s at the Outer Harbor
had its first show on Mohday night. The pictures
unrolled themselves to music from a piano for which
the necessary cash had been raised by the Rev.
Frank Lade, one of our keenest prohibitionists. It
makes good shandy-gaff.
To the ranks of Adelaide verse-writers add Maud
R. Liston, who has just published a collection under
the title of “St. George for England.” Sothe of
the' verses have already appeared in the dailies.
A. E. Nott, general manager of the S. Australian
Brewing Co., who has just relinquished his job after
28 years’ service, was farewelled and given a pre-
sentation by the staff the other* daj'. He isn’t much
more than middle-aged yet; but he is well-to-do arid
so is his wife, and he wants more leisure to enjoy
his rheumatism.
The late Lieut. R. Q. Scott left £20,000 to his
widow and small son. He was vine-growing here
when war broke out and was killed in action in
France about a year ago.
Major Cavanagh-Mainwaring, who has been with
the A.I.F. ever since August, 1914, has cbme back
to South Aus. on duty. He left here as
Captain of the Field Ambulance of the 3rd Light
Horse, and since then has done hospital work on
Gallipoli and in Egypt and Macedonia. The Serbian
White Eagle is the Order that has come to him.
Ruthven li. Forbes, who represents the Suzuki
Co., has been entertaining Shigetaro Kawasaki, chief
geologist to the Japanese Government in Korea. The
little brown men, as Dr. Morrison told us lately, are
developing Korea with remarkable success; and the
geologist is come to pick up wrinkles from our
great smelting-works at Port Pirie and Wallaroo.
Beatrice Henty, one of the few Melbourne
war-workers to receive a Commandership in
the Order of the British Empire, is grand-
daughter of the pioneering James Ilenty, of
Portland, and daughter of the late Henry,
of pious memory. Early in the war. when
she started as superintendent of the All-tor-
Sokliers’ League, energetic Beatrice took "No
Nonsense Here” as her unwritten motto. Get-
ting results has been her one aim, with the
consequence that the social-butterfly type
of war-fiddler soon found herself fading right
out of the picture. Some of em made spite-
ful remarks as they went, but the willing
majority kept the comforts-supplymg
machine grinding steadily ahead, with both
feet on the pedals and not a hand idle. Ihe
figures to date tell a magnificent tale of per-
sistent toil.
Hilda Bull that was, who became Mrs.
Louis Esson, and is now with him in
Blighty, is working for the War Office on a
travelling Medical Board. Her job is to
examine girl recruits for various depart-
ments of army service, and slie is making an
interesting tour of it.
Captain Ronald Cumming. who went to
the Front as orderly to General McNicolt
on that scarred soldier’s return to France,
has been handed the Croix de Guerre. Last
October, after Passchendaele, Cumming went
through much the same life-and-deatli strug-
gle with wounds as did his General on Gal-
lipoli. Now he is booked to go on H.Q.
staff of the 10th. after a term of easy work
in France.
Geoffrey Shillinglaw, who gave up his man-
ager’s job with the National Bank in Mel-
bourne to plunge into war work, has had
some chastening experiences while working
for the Anzac Buffet in London. The man
who used to sit in his office and condescend
to see a client about an overdraft finds him-
self bossed by women workers. In the midst
of intricate figure-work an agitated dame
rushes in to mention that milk-o charged for
half a pint too much that morning, and it’s
Shillinglaw’s job to see that such a catas-
trophe doesn’t occur again.
One of the three airmen who came home
last week was young Cecil James, a son of
Major G. 11. James, cadet trainer and rifle
coach, and brisk little Britomarte James,
presswoman and war-worker, now in
Blighty. Cecil was flying at 16,000* feet
when a Boche shell burst near him, and
though lie brought his ’plane down safely
shell-shock forced him to quit the unpleasant
land of France.
Back to Australia, “Big” Bailli'eu’s
nephew, Flight-Lieutenant Reggie, M.C., an
old Melbourne Grammar boy, whose stunt
practically duplicated that for which F. H.
Macmaniara, another Victorian airman, won
the V.C. With his observer, Lieutenant It.
M. Smith, M.C., Reggie lobbed on the
Egyptian sands to rescue a pilot who had
been forced to land and had fired his machine.
Smith stood-off Abdul with his revolver until
Baillieu was ready, and then all three left
in Bailliou’s ’plane, which, being heavily
laden, could not climb above 500 feet, and
was consequently under heavy fire. But it
took them 60 miles to safety.
Sergeant-major Flora Sandes, of the Ser-
bian Army, has been heard of in London.
She wears her man’s uniform as befits a
woman who has campaigned with one of the
bravest little armies in Europe. She was
wounded at Monastir and decorated.
Expected back from Blighty this month.
Lieut.-Colonel J. W. Springthorpe. who for
a year has been in charge of shell-shock Cases
in a hospital of 1200 beds, llis experience
should be of immense value here. He has
visited the leading hospitals for the treat-
ment of such cases in England and I* ranee,
especially those institutions near the Front.
He has also given some study to the pension
question. When he returned from Egypt
earlier in the war he took the opportunity to
get married, but it was not long before he
rejoined the A.M.C. and sailed in anew to
help battered Billjim.
Genthelp Glanville, of the Newdigate staff,
fell in love with the very young niece of the
Governor. Miss Winifred Newdigate re-
sponded with all the fervor of romantic li,
so her vice-regal uncle packed them off to
England'—on different boats —so that they
may ask the consent of the head of Wini-
fred’s house to an engagement. (The Head
of the House is her brother, aged about -M.)
Winifred is a rich young person in her own
right. She is even richer in proportion than
the Governor Newdigates, who keep the
wolf from the door by the careful manipula-
tion of about £40.000 a year. One Booth
is on his way out to fill the genthelp gap
left by Glanville. In the meantime all the
social jobbing is being done by Captain
Fitzgerald (he has just become engaged to
Pauline Curran, daughter of Curran ot
Tatt.’s). and Browne, the permanent local
aide of great distinction.
The Toorak Moore widow had hardly fin-
ished unpacking in the Rutter Clarkes
Dutch-gardened castle when daughter Nell
gave notice that she and Larry Heath, or
Gaunt’s, had agreed to be made one in the
immediate future.
From “Rosna,” in London —weddings, of
course
Roma May, a little Australian who has done some
music-hall work in this isle and for three years has
worked like a clock entertaining Tommy Anzac and
Pte. Billjim, was married to a Billjim of her own
on January 16. He is Lieut. J. W. Stabback, M. 0.,
and a brigade or two of Anzac Buffet folk, headed
by chairman John McCall, went to wish them luck.
Lorna, daughter of Mrs. Purves-Smith, of St. Hilda,
is now O.C. Cant. McAlister Moffat-Pender. The
new husband is a Scotch international footballer and
a relative of the Moffats of the Western District of
Victoria. The bride and her mother have been
mighty war-workers, first in Paris and latelj in
London. One uncle gave her away and another tied
her up.
The best confetti is to flutter on April 10,,
when the medical McAdams’ chick Beryl
pairs off with the George Kelly widow s
younger son at Melbourne Grammar ( hapel.
At the same hour violinist Carmen Delprat
marries her Dutch consul.
Ada Armytage. of the Como family, is
rousing Beaconsfield and Berwick to a big
Easter effort for Our Boys. There are special
prizes for the most useful article made by a
man and the prettiest article made by a
woman out of waste material. And a Coun-
try Fair, with prizes for the biggest pumpkin
and other weird exhibits.
There is more glad news about the
Equestrian Club girls’ approaching side-show
at Bendigo. The Easter celebration up north
is a “Back to Bendigo” affair, hence bed-’n’-
board is very precious ; so the local Benevo-
lent Asylum has come forward and offered
its extensive stabling for the use of those
equestrians who can’t make other arrange-
ments, aud has gallantly volunteered the use
of a number of spare beds for removal to
the horse-lines. The offer speaks well for
Bendigo’s prosperity. The trouble in most
cities where they have “benevolent” asylums
is that there isn’t enough bed to go round
among the weary foot-travellers.
To aid the French Red Cross and Societe
Maternelle, Mrs. The.vre Weigall is arrang-
ing a series of “Talks at the Piano” —not
trivial society-entertainer stuff, but good
highbrow music, as the Weigall lady is a
musician of some standing. “Aida,”
“Otello,” “Louise” and other grand operas
are down for dissection. .Jack Sanderson
has lent his Toorak home for tin* outburst,
and the Naicest are getting their bibs and
tuckers ready.
Esther Mitchell, now playing a lead in
“Turn to the llight,” made a lot of money
on Our Boys’ Day by driving round in an
ordinary cart (I think it was a milk-o’s)
and collecting from the crowd. Sin* was a
very fetching cadger. Esther is a Sydney
girl who has had only live years of stage
work. She appeared here before in “Mr.
Wu,” but was only one of the fake Chinese
maidens who got badgered because they did
not wear enough make-up.
Elsie Mackay, daughter of Sam, is playing
lead at a Chicago theatre in “Gipsy Trail,”
described as “a 1917 comedy-romance.”
Chicago papers call Elsie “that dazzling
Australian charmer.” Tree introduced her to
the American boards and she is, by all
accounts, a brilliant success.
It’s a sign of the homeless times that John
Madden. Lieut.-Governor and Chief Justice,
was buried from a glorified apartment house
—the big brick barracks that baronet S’Wil-
liam Gjiarke built for himself and his descend-
ants just beyond Fitzroy Gardens. The
place had another such a day of gloomy
splendor years ago, when young Clive
Clarke’s coffin was borne up the street to
Trinity Church by eight sweating gunners of
the gorgeous Kupertswood Battery, origi-
nated and maintained by the first baronet.
Tours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

Mellowness is that alluring perfection of flavour that begets the happy smile of appreciation. Dewar’s never
robs one of pleasure—be the anticipation ever so great. Its charm of flavour is elusive and exclusive?—
soft, rich, and yet crisp.


STRENGTH AND ENERGY CREATED
BY PHOSPHATE.
NO TASK TOO HARD; NO STRAIN
TOO GREAT.
There is no longer any reason why the
nervous, hesitant man or woman should
envy those who are strong, resourceful and
calm, for, according to an eminent specialist,
such strength is within the easy reach of all
who desire it. Men and women are strong
mentally and physically in proportion to the
strength of their nerves, and nerves are
strong or weak according to the amount
of phosphate they absorb. Ordinarily
the nerves derive phosphate from di-
gested food, ( but owing to faulty metabo-
lism or to abnormal strain, the phosphate
thus taken up often proves insufficient, and
in consequence the nerves become weak and
exhausted. To remedy such a condition it is
necessary that the nerves should be provided
with more phosphate, and the use of the
concentrated bitro-phosphate, which most
chemists now stock in the form of five-grain
compressed tablets, is highly recommended.
Phosphate in this form is rapidly absorbed,
and a decided improvement in the general
health is soon noticeable. Nerves become
steady and strong, and the brain acts
quickly and clearly. Eyes become bright,
and the cheeks glow with healthy color. No
task seems too hard, no strain too great.
Abundant energy displaces lassitude, and
great strength reigns in the place of weak-
ness. — Advt.

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Jimsey”: Here’s another notable case of
the homing instinct. My dad took delivery of 1.500
cattle from a station near the junction of the Mit-
chell and Palmer rivers (North Bananaland) and
steered them to a station in Gippsland. The second
night out on the home journey he lost his horse, and
although a day was spent in hunting for him, he
couldn’t be found. About two months after the old
man had reached home (a small station on the
Monaro) the wanderer turned up, quite well but
terribly thin. He was an iron-grey gelding, rising
seven, boasted of a grand old Australian pedigree
(Furious Riding out of the Bush), and was roped on
the Monaro as a two-year-old.
* # * *
“Barcoo” : When a shearer is working for
a tally the kicking sheep is his nark, and it re-
mained for “Grass-seed” Collins, a Bananaland
Dreadnought, to discover how to anchor the protest-
ing jumbuck. With a buckle strap, the fore and
hind feet, crossed fore and aft, just above the hoofs,
are tightly hitched together. On the “whipping”
side (the finishing side) the adjusting takes just one
second when the sheep has been removed from thq
“catching” pen to the shearing floor; the removal
of the hobble-strap takes less. Rams and crossbreds
are particularly bad kickers. With this device
they take their gruel as gently as a tame curate in
the chair of a manicurist.
VERY LAX.
SOAK: “Put it down on the slate, unit yer?”
BARMAN : “ ’Ere; tee don’t keep no slate ’ere.”
SOAK (getting it down hurriedly) : “Well, don’t blame me if yer forget all about it."
: I don’t know how long a snake
can stay under water, but I’ve kept one submerged
for a full 20 minutes by the watch. It was a
brown fellow and in full view the whole time.
Finally I raked him out and gave him the woodener
I’d been saving up for him. The winter-sleep of
snakes, by the way, is a delusion. Those I have
unearthed have had all their wits about them. I
think they hibernate simply because during winter
their natural food is unprocurable. They constantly
sun themselves outside their dormitories on bright
days in winter, and are quite ready for battle,
although not so savage as when the mating instinct
stirs in them in late spring or early summer. , I
know deadly snakes mate in a temperate climate as
early as October 10. On the Monaro (N.S.W.) high-
lands above the coast-range the honeymoon begins
later, and I have there, by the way, seen a black and
a brown snake engaged in serpentine coquetry. Are
there hybrids among snakes?
* * * #
“I. Say”: If “T.F.M.” (B. 21/2/TS) is
correct as to the date of settlement' at Mallacoota
(1842), it seems possible that Port Albert was as
early or .earlier. A party of eight left Melbourne
in the Singapore, 300 tons, in 1842, for Corner Inlet.
They proceeded to and named Port Albert, where
they built a two-roomed cottage. They were looking
for a harbor near Gippsland country, and for a good
stock route. Two boats from the wrecked Clonmel
were found on the .beach opposite Port Albert, and
one of them was used. The Albert and the Tara
rivulets were named (the latter after an abo., Charley
Tara) ; also the Latrobe River arid Lake Wellington.
The overlanding party struck civilisation at Western-
port, but failed to find a decent stock route.
■ :\ * * *
“Try Fluke”: It’s a rare sight these days,
the tattooed dial of a brown MIL. citizen. Of the
hundreds I used to know when I was a youngster, not
more than a dozen or so are still above the soil. That’s
males; there are still plenty of chin-decorated ladies
making lively the up-country townships, and now and
again blocking the traffic in Wellington or Auckland
while they discuss Desert Gold or some other famous
moke. There are a few practitioners of the moko
art still on the job, and the usual charge is 30s. for
the feminine lips and chin. Almost as rare as the
blue-mofco-ed face is the'tattooed nether part of Hone
Tikera. The old-timers had their anatomy under the
shawl-kilt adorned with vast skill and pains, so that
from hips to knee or thereabouts the warrior was a
work of art in blue scrolls, chevrons and diamonds,
after the manner of the black-wiofco-ed Samoan
warrior, only more so. I know one big chief (half-
caste) —he drives his swell motor-car in the King
Country,—who was accustomed to divert his friends
and astonish the new-comers by exhibiting a choice
piece of vertu in the form of a tattooed back, etc.
But he’s more reserved now that he’s got a big bank
account. He was about the last man tattooed by the
old tohungas. The daisy of them all, though, was
my venerable acquaintance Miti Kakau, of Hokianga.
Miti had the unexampled honor of displaying his
tattooed breech to royalty, no less. At the great
gathering of the clans at Rotorua to meet the present
King and Queen my unregenerate friend was sort of
premiere danseur in the Ngapuhis’ war-dance before
the royal stand. At a fortuitous moment he charged
to the front and with a right-about 1 whirl and a
flick-up of his kilt lie presented a bosker view to the
distinguished company—as a mark of high respect.
Missionaries and Cabinet Ministers and other shocked
dignitaries expostulated with the ancient athlete
when the show was over, but Miti’s rejoinder was to
the effect that if royalty hadn’t seen a well-tattooed
g'entleman before it was time it did, wherefore he
obliged on behalf of the tribe. If Mary of York saw
Miti and his art-gallery she, like a lady, never let on.
RIGHT DOWN TO IT.
WELL-MEANING PERSON : “ Dear, dear; I’m
afraid your friend is — er—do you think
a glass of soda-water would pick him
up?”
THE PILOT : “Shoda-warrer! ’E’s that far
submerged it’d take a depth bomb t' 'are
any ’feet on ’im.”
“K.R.”: The fact that the heart of the
gohanna or lace lizard will beat for hours after the
reptile has been killed is by no means unparalleled
in the reptile world. The heart of the fresh-water
turtle will jog on for at least 10 hours. I have
observed it still beating at that length of time after
demise, and but little diminished in vigor. The
stump-tailed lizard of W.A. has a record but little
inferior to that of ; brother turtle. It would seem,
from observation, that the reptilian heart-beat lasts
longer after death than that of any other vertebrate
animal. The common Australian frog keeps its clock
ticking for two or three hours after lights-out.

MICKIE MOLLYNOO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We’re marchin’ out, we dunno where, to meet we
dunno who;
But here we lights eventual, ’n’ sighs ’n’ slips the
kit,
’N’, ’struth, the first to take us on is Mickie Mollynoo!
A copper of the Port he was, when ’istory was writ.
Sez I: “We’re sent to face the foe, ’n’ selp me, this
is It.”
A shine John Hop is Mollynoo. A mix-up with the
push
Is all his joy. One evenin’ when his baton’s flyin’
free
I takes a baby brick, ’n’ drives it hard agin the cush,
’N’ Privit Mick is scattered out fer all the world
to see,
But not afore indelible he’s put his mark on me.
I got the signs Masonic all inlaid along me lug
Where Molly, P.C., swiped me in them ’appy, care-
less days.
He’s sargin’ now, a vet’ran; I’m a newchum and a
mug,
’N’ when he sorter fixes me there’s somethin’ in
his gaze
That’s pensive like. “Move on!” sez he. “Keep
movin’ there! ” he says.
If after this I dreams of scraps promiscuous and
crool,
The mills in Butcher’s Alley when the watch is on
the wine,
Those nights he raided Wylie’s shed to break the two-
up School,
I takes a screw at Molly. With a grin that ain’t
divine
He’s toyin’ with a scar of old I reckernise as mine.
’N’ so I’m layin’ for it, ’n’ I’m wonderin how ’n’
what.
We’re signed on with the Germans ’n’ there ain’t
a vacant date;
But sure it’s coinin’ to me, ’n’ it’s cornin’ ’ard ’n’ ’ot.
Me lurk is patient waitin’, but I’m trimmin’ while
I wait
A brick to jab or swing with, in a willin’ tater-
tate.
Oh, judge me wonder! There’s a scrim that follers on
a raid.
I’m roughin’ it all-in with Hans. He socks me
such a bat
I slides on somethin’ narsty, hi’ me little grave is
made ;
But Molly butts my Hun, ’n’ leaves no face be-
neath his hat,
’N’, “ ’Scuse me, Mister Heir,” sez he, “I have a
lien on that!”
He helps me under cover, ’iv’ he ’ands me somethin’
wet
(I’ve got a lick or tw'o that leaves me feelin’ pretty
sick).
“Lor love yeh, ole John Hop,” sez I, “yiv buried me
in debt.”
“Don’t mintion ut at all,” he sez, ’n’ eyes me
arf-a-tick.
’N’ back there in the trench I sits, V trims
another brick.
EXCLUSIVE.
“Hullo, been in for your swim?”
“Ah — no. Some other Johnny was using the baths.”
’Tis all this now a month or more; then Mollynoo
sez he:
“Come aisy, Jumtn, yeh loafer, little hell ’n’ all
to view.
A job most illegant is on, cut out fer you ’n’ me.
The damnedest, dirtiest fighter on the Continent is
you,
Bar one, yeh gougin’ thafe, • ’n’ that is Sargin’
Mollynoo !”
I take, with knife ’n’ pistol, arf a brick to line me
shirt.
We creeps a thousan’ yards or so to jigger up a gun
Which seven Huns is workin’ on the Irish like a
squirt.
We gets across them, me ’n’ him. I pots the extra
one;
Mick chokes his third in comfort, ’n’, be’old, the
thing is done!
He stands above me, rakin’ sweat from off his gleam-
in’ nut.
“Me dipper’s leakin’, Mick,” sez I; “me leg is bit
in two.”
Sez he: “Bleed there in comfort, I’m for bringin’
help, ye scut.”
He’s back in twenty minutes, with a dillied Ger-
man crew.
“Three’ll carry in the gun,” sez he, “the rest will
carry you.”
I dunno how he got ’em, but he made them barrer me.
They lugged the gun before him, ’n’ he yarded
them like geese.
Then Mickie s’lutes the Major. “They’re in custody,”
sez he,
“Fer conduc’ calculated to provoke a breach iv peace,
A-tearin’ iv me uniform, ’n’ ’saultin’ the po-lice.”

1 I‘gent missive from Bananaland :
The Hon. Editor,
Sydney Bulletin,
Dear Sir.
Some time previously your contributor of Abo.
P ge make suggestions for ceasing restlessness in
Dorses when attaching shoes. Hon. contributor had
proposition to smack said horse between both eyes
briskly with hand palm, and no more trouble to issue
irom quadruped. Has hon. contributor make actual
exercise of this experiment dear Sir? Or is it his
constitution of sense of humor? Will vou kindlv
supply to my insignificant self name and* address of
above gentleman?
Yours most respectively,
O. Yamaguciii,
Japanese Cook, etc.
“Bung”: “Jimmie Pannikin” (8.14/2/’18)
complains that the cultivation of native fruits and
flowers has received very little attention in our
country schools. Well, why 'does not the Depart-
ment give the teachers a bit of encouragement? In
1916 every kid-whacker throughout N. S. Wales
was ordered to pull off his coat, build fences and
plant trees for protection against westerly winds,
whether they blew in the locality or 'not. A
friend of mine applied for seedlings of that beauti-
ful South Coast native, the boobyaloe. He wrote
voluminously regarding his experience with the
tiee, and explained its hardiness, rapid growth to
maturity, and other considerations that made it an
ideal playground shade-tree and ornament. In reply
he received a consignment of the sorrowful pin us
msrgnis and Canadian giant elms!
* * * *
“Jackdaw”: I flayed a wombat once. I
shudder when I think of it. It took two hours’ hard
knifing to cut off the rind, 11 minutes’ hard nailing
to peg it on a tree, the sun six weeks’ hard flaming
to dry the thing, me two hours-and-a-bit’s hard
rasping to get the slivers off, and the henchman three
minutes’ hard sawing to trim the edges. But a
healthy old wombat cover makes an everlasting door-
mat, so the time wasn’t wasted.
* * * *
‘Dug-out”: For the kill-’em-quick stakes
I’ll put.my bit on a little grey insect about an inch
long, covered with grey hairs, or bristles, and com-
monly known in the southern districts of N. S. Wales
as fifty-legs.. I saw a fox-terrier that was tunnelling
after a rabbit suddenly go through a series of circu-
lar movements accompanied by frantic howls and
desperate attempts to clear something from his nose.
Upon investigation I found that a fifty-legs had
fastened on to foxie. When freed of the hanger-on
the dog developed tired feeling and reclined in the
shade of a near-by gum. About 40 minutes later he
was dead. AVhat’s the name and pedigree of this
murderous insect or reptile?
* * * «
“li.A.Y.” ; There’s another champion axe-
man, named Gardiner, cutting fuel for Clarence River
(N.S.W.) butter factories. He offers to back himself
to fall, chop and split a cord of firewood (green oak)
in an hour. It looks a tall order; but so far no one
who has seen him use the chopper has reached for
his dough.
* * # »
“Know Nothing”: Consider the bullocky
on the North Coast (N.S.W.). Always he is pur-
sued by a most business-like Stock De-
partment, with a. threat to cancel his per-
mit to work unless he dips his bullocks
every 21 days in a mixture that would
scald the rings off a maul. With the
certainty of 10 or 12 days’ lost time, the
horror of a maddened team, the possi-
bility of some of them dying (and of re-
ceiving no compensation if they do), is it
any wonder that the jangled man embalms
the atmosphere at times? If, as some-
times happens, he gets in a full working
month and draws his timber any old
distance up to 20 miles, he probably
finds the bar bad, no boats coming in and
no timber going out —unless on a flood. To
make a real bullock-driver, secure a young
church-going man; sell him a team of 20
for £460; charge him £1 ss. per week
for grass, and for white hide about Ss.
per inch; license 2s. 6d. per month, and
royalty Is. per 100. Lead him to a patch
of pine; explain that generally he has to
fall and work it himself and cut his
own roads. By the time that is done
he will be in a good frame of mind to
lose the 10 or 12 days for dipping. You
needn’t remind him that it may rain
throughout the days that intervene
between dippings. May Peter in his
mercy pass in the ox-cohductor without
going into details!
“Wandi”: The animal which “Crosscut”
inquires about (B. 21/2/’18) is probably the banded
ant-eater, or myrmecobius, a graceful and active
little creature with long ears and a long, bushy tail,
somewhat like a squirrel when running about. The
upper part of the / body is reddish, darkening towards
the tail and crossed with white or yellow bands. The
under surface is light yellow. The beast is diurnal
in habit, retiring at night into a hollow log or a
hole in the ground, where it also breeds, producing
half a dozen, and occasionally as many as nine, young
WASTE OF TIME.
THE WHITE TRASH: “Gam! Wouldn't I be an idiot to fight you? If I wuz to give you a
black eye it wouldn't show.”
o\qs at a time. Armed with strong digging claws, it
makes short work of opening up an ants’ nest, and it
licks up the swarming inmates in the manner of the
echidna. When in a hurry it leaps along the ground
at a fair pace, and if alarmed quickly takes cover.
Like the ’roo family, it sits up on its hind legs when
at rest or taking observations. Its habitat is South
and West Australia.
SUMMING UP.
J.P.: “The defence is the most fictitious set
of facts I have been privileged to listen
to ever since I hev occupied a seat on
the prejudiciary.” (Proceeds with the
death sentence.)
“L.A.G.” : Ever tasted fresh pig which has
been fed during the early autumn on the refuse frofn
the wine-press? It has a fragrant flavor of its own,
and is most tender. The refuse, stalks and skins, is
merely stacked in the pig yard, and the swine eat
into it as cattle eat into a straw-stack. A good feed
makes ’em very groggy. ' Fowls, too, take to the
grape tucker, which is very fattening.
‘‘Loco”: Our little loco.-shed stables One
engine only. The other morning, when I went on
to the footplate to get ready for a trip, I noticed
some stray ends of grass and. rubbish sticking out
from the recess between the double roof of the cab.
A couple of sparrows had begun to build. I ran the
train, taking the nest along. Next morning more
progress and more protest from the builders as we
moved out. This went on for several days. Then
the cheeky pair began to get careless "and drop
things all over the footplate; so I removed the
nest before complications arose.
* * * *
“Kahbionba”: I have never struck a dis-
trict where goitre did not occur. There are, I
think, at least two very distinct forms of the dis-
ease, one especially incidental to high-strung, over-
active brain-workers, perhaps usually when nearing
their climacteric, and perfectly irrespective of
whether they live on a citied plain or on mountain-
tops. The other form is endemic, and seems to be
caused mainly, if not entirely, by soil-secretions—
so far as I can learn, magnesian. Women who
drink nothing but tank-water turned into tea seem
even more liable to the complaint than those who
are spring-bibbers. The primary absorption in
these cases is done by the cattle whose flesh and
milk are consumed by the patients. I would like to
hear from anyone who has had experience of goitral
eases where there are no known magnesian elements
in the soil of the neighborhood.
“Breeza”: Talking about rabbit poisoning,
I have tried miscellaneous mixtures, and found
thistle roots with jam and a little whisky (say, a
small nobbier to a 21b. tin of jam) the best thing
to carry the poison. Much ahead of a eucalyptus
decoy. With whisky and sugar on thistle roots I
have had better success than with any advertised
decoy; ditto with roots,, sugar pnd a little nutmeg.
But I look for success with these only when grass is
dry and feed generally scarce.
*** * A
'“Bouragi”: Twenty-five years of rigid
suppression and missionary effort in Papua have
utterly failed to suppress the “magician” who
flourishes with a power and prestige unknown even
among the ju-ju men of West Africa. Even the
most carefully brought-up of native teachers nurses
in his heart a deadly fear pf the pourri-pourri man,
and retains a belief in his powers which is a good
deal more definite than his ideas on, say, the doc-
trine of the Trinitj'. Among that excellent force
the Armed Native Constabulary, many pourri-pourri
men are to be found, though they are daily accus-
tomed to the arrest and degradation of supposedly
all-powerful magicians, and are more in contact than
any other Papuans with the practical and logical
side of the white man’s beliefs. One of the best
native n.c.o.’s that I ever knew was a famous pourri-
pourri man, though he did not practice openly. He
had been reared from childhood among the Thursday
Island pearlers, and spoke English with an ease and
fluency that put many of his white contemporaries
in the shade. His manners and habits, and even his
clothing:, when he was out of uniform, were those of
what we consider a superior civilisation. He
delighted greatly in the evenings to dress in white
ducks and yellow boots and parade the. station like a
European, and his opinions of his fellow natives, on
the drill ground or in court, were in quite the white
mans vein. Aet with it all, and his sterling
honesty and reliability, he was a professed operator
of black magic and believed in it as thoroughly as
any of the savages about him. The Papuan medicine*
men move with the times, too. The Anglican Mission
not so long ago found the work of years undone bv
one of their converts, who set up a religion of his
own, curiously combined of Christianity and pourri-
pourri. When I last heard of it, the cult was going
strong.
* * ♦ *
‘W.M.S.”: The “policeman fly” inquired
about by “Steve Hart” (B. 28/2/’18) is, a wasp, and
there are several species in Australia. Digger-wasps
are largely represented in the country, but they do
not all prey on the same insects. The flycatchers
usually store their captures in cells dug in the
ground. In the west and south-west of N. S.
Wales these John Hops may be seen arresting flies
from the backs of the sheep. One species has a black
head, and yellow face, with a black spot in the
centre; another is generally black in tint, varied
with reddish brown; a third is of black and gold.
The prisoners are stored in the cells as food for the
larva of the wasps. Many members of the family
paralyse the insects they gaol by stinging them in
the vital nerve centres, so that the tucker will be
fresh when the eggs are hatched out. It remains
alive, but is unable to move or to escape when
attacked by the voracious grubs. A larger species of
wasp, commonly known as the house-hornet, preys
wholly on spiders. These are paralysed in the same
manner and packed into the mud cells, which the
wasps build and seal up after the eggs have been
laid. There is nothing more marvellous in nature
than the unerring in which the female wasp
proceeds to reduce her prey to a state of inertia
without otherwise injuring it.

“Drofsed” : Is a white porcupine ( echidna)
common or is it a freak? I found one the other day
and' took him home. . But the trouble was to keep
him. After building several houses for him, and dis-
covering that they would not hold him, I transferred
him to a barrel with top Off and about 18in. of fresh
earth at the bottom. That diddled him. He is about
a foot long and covered with white hair and spines,
and looks like a damper with spikes when he hides
his head. His country residence was near Toora,
South Gippsland.
* * * #
“Ibis” : Expound this riddle. Last season,
as has been their custom for years, a pair of welcome
or house swallows built their home in my laundry.
They duly hatched out a family of five. When the
chicks were about a week old the proud parents were
visited by hundreds upon hundreds of swallows. The
air was thick with them, though usually the welcome
swallow is not plentiful in our neighborhood. They
were in a state of wild excitement, twittering and
fluttering incessantly, all trying to get into the
laundry. The visitation lasted two days, ceasing as
abruptly as it commenced. Is it an extraordinary
event for a swallow to hatch five chicks, and had all
swallowdom come to pay respects to such success,
or what was the game? Later in the season pa and
ma had another try, but hatched only two chicks.
ENCORE.
SITTING : “My chauffeur is getting too reck-
less. He gave my wife such a shock the
other day that she teas speechless for a
week.'"

him for mine!”

Our brave boys have enough suffering and danger to endure in the trenches with-
out letting them run unnecessary risk of colds, perhaps ending in serious throat and
chest troubles. We all know what boys are, and how neglectful they are if mother is
not there to keep them up to the mark ; so protect your boys by sending them a bottle
of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery, the prompt and effective cold-banisher. They will be
delighted at your thoughtfulness, and take it to please you at first, and, finding that it
banishes the cold and eases the throat so quickly, later they will fly to it for relief at
the first sign of cold.
All our Soldier boys swear by Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery for Coughs and Colds.
See what some of our boys write: —
Two of our Heroes Praise
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery.
“When I left Australia
with the 19th Battalion, sth
Brigade, on June 25, 1915, I
packed in my kit a bottle of
‘New Discovery,’ because I
had been suffering while in
camp from catarrh of the
throat. I cured myself com-
pletely with this bottle. I
could not get ‘New Discovery’
in Egypt, but I had some
sent to me at Malta, where I
was lying wounded in Flori-
ana Hospital. I have always
regarded ‘New Discovery’ as
my only friend in the medi-
cine line. I always Iceep it
near at hand.
“Yours faithfuly,
“J. MOLLOY,
“1097, C Co., 19th Batt.
“I would-like to say that
Dr. Sheldon’s ‘New Discovery’
has been better to me even
than my luck. I escaped the
severe colds some of my
comrades had because of my
habit of taking a sip of ‘New
Discovery’ every day. It
seems to hafe made my
throat and lungs cold resist-
ant. lam glad to be able to
add my testimony to the
many pals who have found
‘New Discovery’ their mascot.

“Copabella”: It is on March 14 that a
paternal Victorian Government collects a
small fee from shopkeepers who register their
premises, or a large one (£10) from those
who forget to do it. As might be expected
from a legislature of half-measures it doesn’t
bother at all what sort of old humpy it
registers. For the benefit of the very fre-
quent house-manager who doesn’t think about
the old man’s dinner until about 4.55 p.m.,
most of the little hucksters who decorate
street corners in residential' areas, with
their windows littered, with everything
from liquorice-straps and fireworks to haber-
dashery and potatoes, keep a lump of cooked
corned-beef and a piece of “german sausage.”
A Pure Food regulation says such eatables
must be kept away from flies, where and
'how not specified. I lately heard an inquiry for
“sixpenno’th of corned*” and the dainty was
produced from a drawer which also stocked
bootlaces and I don't know what else. When
the next ptomaine catastrophe finds its way
into the newspapers, it is to be hoped some-
body will remember to ask whether the cause
Of it was kept in a gin-case under the- bed or
in a biscuit-tin in the fowlhouse. The
collection of a registration fee should either
be big enough to carry some privilege or
responsibility, or it should be. abolished.
* * * -*
“Cyril S.” : “Arthur R.’s” experiment with
a low aerial (B. 7/3/’IS) proves nothing,
because he only received on it and did not
send. It. is easy to receive without aerials,
but you cannot send without them. The “lines
of electro-motive force” of oscillating waves
bend downwards until they reach the earth.
Naturally the higher you, start those waves
the longer they take to reach the earth and
the more stations they include. In the field
sets, where weight and speed in erecting are
important considerations, the telescopic pole
is still part of the necessary equipment. It
would be promptly dropped if it were useless.
Every man from his own standpoint.
Wyndham Hayes, sanitary contractor, giv-
ing evidence before the Sutherland water-
supply select committee (N.S.W. Parlia-
ment), in answer to a question about the
population, said it varied between 500 pans
per week in winter and nearly 2000 at
('hristmas, but in the slackest times it never
got below 500. ‘.‘The council books,” he
said, “will show that last year I did between
40,000 and 50,000 pans.”
* * * *
“Stripes’’: Why does the Defence Depart-
ment persist in the lift bit of wasting, postage-
stamps on notices forwarded to trainees and
citizen-force cadets? Probably it is nothing
more than a clumsy effort to show a profit in
departments. The Postal Dept, sells (say l
240,000 penny stumps at face value (£1000) ;
the Defence Department enters this on the,
debit side of its pay-books. But the money
is only shifted from one pocket to another :
and an army of officials is employed to help
with the shifting. Some day, perhaps pot in
this generation, a Prime Minister with some
business knowledge will lift the axe to this
foolishness.
“Seeseed” : “Arthur II.” says (B. 7/3/’18)
that the huge aerial masts in wireless will
soon disappear, and that he heard Sydney
from Melbourne with a door-bell circuit only
four feet from the ground. Quite likely. But
if “Arthur” can send a message that far from
a four-feet aerial his fortune is made.. He
says that Balsillie communicated from
Hobart to Melbourne with wires buried ip
the earth. But when it is added that Bal-
sillie’s experiments were carried out in the
shadow of Hobart’s big aerial, any wireless
export will know that they were almost cer-
tainly an instance of what is known as re-
radiation—the energy from the buried wires
was radiated to the aerial and thence re-
radiated to Melbourne.
“Trailwin” : “Dr. Nil” need not bother about
publishing for the benefit of the flapper his
suggested "Hints on Harlotry’ —it would be
simple supererogation. Flappers of 14 up are
engaged m my village making preventive
appliances as part of their regular daily toil.
One curious infant of 15 figured recently in
an unpleasantness: she had been testing the
efficacy of the wares she helped a patriotic
merchant-prince to produce. By the way,
a lady told me the manufacturers were
obliged by law to include one blank in every
packet, as a sporting precaution against
race-suicide. She had struck a blank- —that’s
how I came to know.
The war hasn’t killed all the hopes of
those Australians who were going to get fat
out of “the Page millions” —a more or less
vast and also more or less nebulous English
estate which Brig.-Gbn. Jobson once went
chasing .on behalf of a client. When Jobson
gave It up as hopeless a eo. was formed in
Sydney to establish the claim of a Mr. and
Miss Morris; and something like £OOOO was
thrown in to do the job. Some time ago the
co. ran out of money, and the Federal
Treasurer couldn’t be got to see that the
raising of more capital would help to Win
the |War; so the hat was sent round and a
few pounds were thrown in to maintain the
Morrises in England. But the hat is
nearly empty again, and, according to the
directors, “something must be done to raise
the necessary funds.” The Sydney co. had
hopes once of selling its rights to Mr. Hiram
Somebody of N’York; but alas ! “We have
received no word from the optionee since the
option expired, consequently the directors
presume he was not successful.” It seems
a pretty reasonable presumption:
*#* * -
“G.N.” : Wooden meat-skewers (B. 7/3/TS)
were manufactured 'some years ago in con-
siderable quantities by a mill-owner at Pyr-
liiont, Sydney, and he also invented the
machine that produced them. He turned out
a much more finished article than the im-
ported (at that time principally American),
and, moreover, was supplying them at from
2s. to 3s. per thousand cheaper. Local
butchers were tumbling over themselves to
secure the output, and the same applied to
big firms throughout Maoriland. Curiously
enough, it was lack -of enthusiasm on the
part of the manufacturer that caused the
imported article to again be resorted to.
A hustler with the same opportunity would
by this time have been skewered to a for-
tune.
“Umntu”: Homing Billjims find that the
natives of the Cape fight shy of the two-
shilling piece. This is the result of deceit
and duplicity of Germans. When the florin
returned to common use a few years ago,
Hun traders had the bright idea of palming
them off on the natives as half-crowns. The
niggers were taken in for a while, but when
they found out the truth they called the new
coin “Igelemani” (a German), and it bears
that name among them to this day, as poor
old Kropf, the Lutheran missionary, had to
chronicle in his Kaffir Dictionary.
“McNorth”; In these days of high prices
couldn’t something be done with the dugongs
and turtles so abundant on our far-northern
coasts? The dugong is a big amphibian
weighing up to half a ton, with wholesome,
nourishing flesh that tastes like a cross be-
tween pork and beef. It also contains a
valuable oil. As for turtles, the writer is
no epicure, but a turtle steak is the most
luscious meat he knows of. It is sweet,
juicy and tender. Up here at Cape York
Binghi’s method of catching the beasts is to
go out in a canoe or dinghy armed with a
long, heavy pole and a barbed spear about
a foot long, to which is attached 30 or 40
fathoms of stout lino. The spear is fitted
loosely into a hole in the end of the pole.
When a turtle or dugong is Sighted, Binglii
paddles quietly towards it, and when at a
convenient distance plunges the spear into
its back. The weight of the pole drives the
spear home, and witli the end of the line
njade fast to a thwart Black Brudder tows
his prize to the beach, where Mrs. Binglii
and the kids have the fire, going ready to
roast the lunch. Certain spots in the
waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Torres
Strait and the Barrier Reef have turtles
and dugongs in any quantity. There ought
to lie something in the business if it were
gone into properly, say, witli sailing boats
fitted with curing gear and Binghi spearmen,
under white direction. Even if the meat
could not be sold at lower prices than beef
and mutton, the business would at any rate
bring a very palatable change of diet within
reach of mobs of people who are paying
Zbdiae prices for very commonplace food.
*' j,,; * * *
“ Ell iven”; A friend back from Calcutta
brings the news that the record • price
obtained for wlleatbags by the largest jute
mills there is 3s. 3d. per dozen. Cocky has
to spar up anything from 9s. upwards.
“Leave it to me,” said the Prime Minister.
I can quite understand why in private com-
mercial life the Prime Minister got as far
as' mending umbrellas.

“RUN-DOWN'' PEOPLE.
The condition of being “run-down” is one
that doctors do not recognise as a disease;
the physician of to-day who gets his training
in a hospital where severe disorders only are
encountered, knows little about it. But
those who are run-down in health know that
it is not a fancied affliction.
The expression “run-down” comes from
the feeble action of an unwound clock, and
the comparison is a good one. Applied to
health, it means a condition in which all the
bodily functions are enfeebled. Appetite
fails, the digestion is impaired, the nerves are
impoverished, the complexion becomes pale;
there is no animation, but rather worry and
mental depression. Fatigue is a constant
symptom.
No particular organ being affected, you
must look for relief to the blood, as it circu-
lates everywhere. Improvement in the blood
is quicklv felt throughout the entire system,
and Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are one of the
best and most convenient blood-builders. As
your blood becomes rich and red, the various
organs regain their tone and the body re-
covers its vigor. If you have any or all of
the above symptoms try the tonic treatment
with Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, but never buy
abstitute.

STOP STOMACH DRUGGING.
.NEUTRALISE THE DANGEROUS
ACID WITH A LITTLE MAGNESIA.
Stomach drugging is dangerous. Drugs
otten deaden the • nerves and render them
insensible to pain, but pain serves a good
purpose it is Nature’s method of indicat-
ing that something is interfering with the
smooth working .of the human organism.
When the fault is corrected, the pain will
cease. lain after eiitiug—heartburn, flatu-
lence, etc. usually indicates not that the
stomach is diseased, but that it is troubled
by excessive acidity. The acid irritates and
inflames the delicate lining of the stomach,
and so causes pain. Obviously it is of prime
importance that the cause of this pain should
be removed, and to accomplish this you
should obtain some bisurated magnesia from
yo , u f' chemist - and take half a teaspoonful in
a little water immediately after meals. This
is the remedy which produced such excellent
results in the case of Miss Alice M. Allen.
OJ Fletcher Street, Auburn, Victoria, who
says: “I suffered so severely from indiges-
tion that I often had to lie down, quite ex-
hausted by the pain. I became thin and
felt worn-out. Nothing seemed to do me the
least good until I tried bisurated magnesia,
but the first dose of this made me feel better,
and I have had no return of my complaint."
Equally good results are invariably accom-
plished by bisurated magnesia, because it
neutralises the harmful acid which is the
underlying cause of all the. trouble, and.
having done this, it soothes, heals and
strengthens the stomach and ensures proper
digestion of the food.— Auvt.

Humanity Demands and Paramount Answers with PARAMOUNT PICTURES.
No two minds ever think alike. But all humanity demands interest and entertainment in its “paid for” recreations
with their intense dramatic stories that hold the interest-beautiful settings and locations that hold f h * eye-and a
psychology the unravelling of which interests the mind, aim at the seemingly possible-productions that wili satisfy everyone-and they let there r

POLITICAL
POINTS
Great was the rally on Wednesday last
week when the War Loan got a big send-off
f y om the N.S.W. Millions Club. The A.M.P.
Society through its chairman contributed
two barrow-loads of paper-money to the
movement, and others supplied from a barrel-
tul down to half a pint, according to
their means. The total ran into millions.
Lilt all this glory shouldn’t blind us to the
■tact that it was, in the main, a case of lend-
ing ourselves our own lOTJ’s payable by
ourselves to ourselves, and that our stupen-
dous foreign debts are redeemable in gold, a
commodity that is growing rather rare. All
the local paper-money prosperity that can
be imagined makes no difference in the dire
need to leave off foreign borrowings. When
the foreign loan falls due, even £loo' of
paper, good at full face value in Geelong and
Parramatta and every other town of the
Commonwealth, including Alice Springs and
Pine Creek and Tibooburra, won’t liquidate
10s. of it.
Australia seems to have accepted the
“Lord” Forrest imposition without a kick
or a murmur. The fact that he hasn’t a
son may be partly accountable for public
indifference to Bigjohn’s bauble, but it goes
“THAT BRUTE'LL BITE ME YET.”
$
without saying that somebody with a son
and heir (like, the late William Clarke) will
get a transmittable handle presently, and
the old man’s decease will be the signal for
the press of this great country to refer to
his offspring as “Sir” or “Lord.” The son
may be an exceptionally poor specimen of
an Australian in intellect and physique, not
to mention _ morals, but the stamp of
nobility” will be on every link of him. As
a subject for snobbery and grovel he will
serve just as badly as a better man. The
girl who shrinks from marrying him will be
bribed with a titular distinction for h-rself,
and the prospect of becoming the mothe* of
a personage. Canada is now protesting
against having such detriments to manhood
thrust upon the body politic. When is the
Australian National Party going to protest?
a Censor, who keeps so many important
t l f ?- cts froi P reaching the public
r appealing to its commonsense, has
permitted the publication of an interesting
disclosure by Chanter, M.H.R. In Mel-
pA™?, laSt week .Chanter stated that when
Kabaul was occupied certain documents were
discovered disclosing the whole German de-
sign to annex Australia ; and huge stocks of
oil and other supplies had been stored in
readiness for the Day. Now about those
ha Cl !rl entS ‘ No design of annexation could
lx. discovered that didn’t involve German
In?!- 6 " 18 w t I e Commonwealth in the con-
W a ’ , wh ? were those German
, ’ f S a " d why ha \' e they not been in-
dicted for treason? On the one hand the
A^f' a r GoVer ™ ie »t is ev er complaining of
ostialian indilterence to the imminence of
the Hun menace, and on the other hand it
pursues a policy of silence which lulls sus-
picion. \\ ho is it that is so interested in
lulling suspicions?
Our party system gives some weird re-
sults. There was in the Queensland Labor
crowd m last Parliament a keen, solid busi-
ness man named T. L. Jones, who had the
respect of everybody. Pie was defeated. The
other very experienced business man in the
.Labor party was Lennon, formerly northern
manager for Burns, Pliilp and Co. He had a
hard fight too. The fact seems to be that, while
men like this get more venomous opposition
than the average from the “right-thinking
person” who fancies that a man should vote
with Ins bank account and not with his
head, they don’t arouse much enthusiasm
among what is called their own crowd, which
doesn’t think at all.
The Commonwealth debt in the way of
i°o a K AZ d J aid bm now tots up to about
£.150,000.000, and if Willie Watt is Treas-
urer en<l of the year he will have a
p.n. of £600,000,000 within range of his spy-
There is also a States blister of
£400,000,000, which brings an Australian
lOL tor £1,000,000,000 almost up to the
dooistep. Some of this will be revenue-
earning ; some will be a source of direct loss;
about half of it will be just plain dead-
weight. By taxation the States and the
vo wllic!l are now raising about
£0p,000,000 a year, are clearly going to be
obliged to lift £50,000,000; nevertheless
though the number of adult male workers in
the Commonwealth is not much over a mil-
lion, the Broken Hill miners the other day
intimated that during the next six months
they would consider whether they ought to
work more than 40 hours a week!
If the worst ever arrives and Pearce is
pmed from his job of Director-General of
Muddle, it will be easy for him to start in
business. The ad. in the Argus will run
like this: —
COLLEGE OF CHAOS.
Students Receive Individual Tuition.
Young men before deciding upon a career should
write for particulars of the curriculum at this insti-
tution. There are unlimited opportunities in the
world for making a mess. Why not make a bigger
mess than anyone else? Thousands of men are
turned out of our public schools and universities
who are unable to do anything except follow hum-
dium principles and strain after efficiency. Do not
be misled. Efficiency is a fetich. Look around you
and count up the number of bungling citizens who
have risen to fame and fortune. Seize the oppor-
tunity ; emulate their achievements. Take notice
of all the little men in big places. Dare to be
Little! Learn how to keep the sluicegate of waste
ajar. Consult Me. Pamphlets containing a narra-
tive of “WHAT I DID BEFORE I WAS FOUND
OUT” posted free on application.
Any citizen who refuses to give him a testi-
monial will, of course, be prosecuted under
the War Precautions Act.
Maoriland Treasurer Joe Ward has been
again explaining the justice of letting in-
come derived from war loans escape taxa-
tion. Boiled- down it comes to this:—
Maoriland will probably contract a war debt of
£100,000,000. By paying the lenders 41 per cent,
free of income tax the country will save £375,000
annually, which would be lost by paying 61 per
cent, and levying taxation. If the higher rate were
given and taxation imposed there would be no more
“cheap money for settlers.”
To assert that there is national economy in
removing £100,000,000 from the ambit of
tax is characteristic of Joe Ward. And so is
the yarn about the connection between keep-
ing money “cheap for settlers and workers”
by paying only 41 per cent, to big lenders
for war. The effect of the exemption is to
give these lenders a 6 and 7 per cent, invest-
ment and must inevitably push up the rate
for other requirements. However, Ward
now promises that next time he borrows the
little man shall be able to get in at 5 per
cent, and pay income tax ; but the heavily-
gilded citizen will still get 4i< without
deduction. Which makes tilings no better
for the general body of taxpayers, but only
a little worse, since the man who wouldn’t
pay any tax to speak of will now get a
trifle more interest, while the other person
won’t be affected at all.
The feminine note is much heard in the
S. Aus. election. It is not only that Mrs.
Jeanne Young and a less-known Mrs. Sig-
gins are standing for Parliament. Crawford
Vaughan, the ex-Premier, has left his inter-
ests in the hands of his clever wife while he
is orating in America. It seems to have
been understood that she would not re-
nominate him, and the Fusion party chose
its candidates. But nominated he is, though
he has now to be classified as an Indepen-
dent.
From an old Northern hand :
Queensland Labor-leader Ryan is to be provided
with a Federal seat very soon; most likely he will
step into the shoes of Maranoa Page. He has his
eyes on the Prime Ministership of Australia; and
now that he has so successfully led his party back
to power, the time is ripe for a step towards his
goal. Theodore will become leader in Queensland,
and though without the brilliance of Ryan he is
strong and capable, and has the confidence of his
party. The Cabinet will undergo a few changes.
Fihelly is the most certain of the old bunch. Fear-
less, unrestrained and full of faith in himself, he has
become the idol of a large section of Queenslanders.
At the same time he is the most bitterly-hated man
in the State. If he keeps his head he will achieve
much. Huxham, Ilardacre and Coyne may be re-
placed by younger men. This is a young man’s
party nothing if not vigorous. Hunter is sure of
a place if he does not immediately go to London as
Agent-General. McCormack, the ex-Speaker, will be
in the Cabinet if he pleases. If Coyne leaves the
Railways Kirwan, the ex-porter, is almost certain of
the portfolio. The team otherwise will be very
strong, with an even more pronounced tendency to
State-ownership, than hitherto. But it will sadly
miss Ryan when he goes. He is shrewd and keen,
and has the capacity for making friends and a
courtesy which nothing can ruffle. The South doesn’t
yet know this man.
THE PRISONER OF WAR.
Ryan, of Queensland, will have a brother-
in-law —Mahoney, of Pittsworth—to help
him in the new House if the contingent vote
doesn’t out him. Mahonev is a lawyer; so
is F. T. Brennan, who beat Tolmie, the ex-
Liberal leader, who had held the Toowoom-
ba seat for 17 years.
Bowser of Victoria wasn’t an inspiriting
figure, but it will at least be remembered to
his credit that he threw up his job when
the Labor party and its allies carried a
snatch vote against his plans for reducing
the deficit. An Australian Premier who
goes out on that issue is almost as rare as
the man who committed suicide bv dropping
bombs on himself from an aeroplane. 11 S
MEAN DOG.
“Mean — why, he struck a winner on Satur-
day"
“And wouldn't let you on to it?”
“Worse than that — wouldn't lend me a quid
to hack it."
The old Earl of Halsbury, 92, onetime Lord
Chancellor, tottered into the House of Peers
the other day in order to move the rejection
of the bill to admit women as solicitors. The
excited ancient implored the House to keep
ladies off the legal grass which had been ever
sacred to their lordships’ sex. Doubtless he
wept as he thought of what his grandfather
would have said to this bill. And still lie
was defeated—by 47 votes to 19.

THE BLAME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The question now is upon whose shoulders should
the blame [for the Defence Department’s chaos] fall?”
Wanted—a scapegoat. Is there one in sight?
Some underling whose steps remain in doubt,
Who looked a little to the left or right
Or with some bold suggestion keen and bright
Appeared the heavyweights of power to flout.
Let him be sought. The wilderness is wide
Where he may lose himself in shifting sands,
Thirst for his mate and hunger for his bride;
There let him take our sins and so abide,
For we must get the matter off our hands.
It was a fine idea old Moses found,
And still it works to match our soul’s desire:
Get some poor wight to bear the burden round
And leave our precious reputation sound.
Who plucked the chestnuts for us from the fire ?

WORMS.
ONE NINE INCHES LONG AND ANOTHER FOUR
INCHES PASSED BY CHILD AFTER TAKING
COMSTOCK’S “DEAD SHOT” WORM PELLETS.
Mrs. A. E. Bade, of 203 McKillop Street,
East Geelong, Vic., writes: —“I have great
pleasure in writing to you to let you know
the satisfactory results I had in using your
‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets for my young son,
aged 14 years. He had been ailing for some
time and complained of pain in the spine and
a very sore stomach, and often in the night
would start vomiting without any warning
whatever. Pie also had several fainting
turns. I became alarmed and took him to
the doctor, but the treatment did him no
good. I then thought I would try your
Worm Tablets, as to me he had every
appearance of worms. I procured a bottle
of them, together with a bottle of Indian
Root Pills, and commenced the treatment.
The second day after taking them he passed
a stomach worm nine inches long, and the
next day one four inches long. Since then
he has picked up wonderfully and is twice
the child he was. If he shows any signs
again I will not hesitate to try them, as I
was so pleased with the results. I am most
grateful to the proprietors of these tablets,
as my husband is away on Active. Service,
and the worry of our boy being so ill nearly
drove me mad. Thanking you again.”
STOMACH WORMS.
A MENACE TO CHILDREN.
Stomach worms are undoubtedly the most
invidious kind of all. They inhabit the
stomach and inflict great havoc upon their
victim. They deprive the victim of half the
nutriment he consumes, and when the
stomach is empty gnaw the sides of the
stomach, causing such terrible sensations as
to often cause faintness. Aperient medi-
cines have no effect upon them, for when
any purgative is taken they fasten them-
selves to the walls of the stomach by a
groove running down their side. The best
method of dislodedns stomach worms is to
starve the system and take Comstock’s
“Dead Shot’’ Worm Pellets. The worms are
weakened by the want of food, and are
induced to take whatever is taken into the
stomach. Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm
Pellets contain the pr opertics which sicken
and disable-the worms, and a dose of opening
medicine will clear therm out of the system.
Comstock’s “Dead Phot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable i nedicinal preparation
for the eradication of w onus in children and
adults. For sale by all chemists and store-
keepers, price 3s. 6d. pnr packet, or will be
sent post paid at the same price by The

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Contemplating Saturday’s Doncaster from
the distance of a previous week, the calm certainty
with which cash had been hurried on to various
nags is mighty hard to understand. There is never
anything certain about a Doncaster, and this year
it looks just as open as usual. In spite of' his
9st. 121 b. Cetigne is entitled to great respect, and
it would be no surprise to this page if the champion
won. Hut the last furlong of a Doncaster is gruel-
ling, and lcwt. 261 b. is likely to feel terribly heavy
even to so resolute a horse as this. But make no
mistake about Cetigne having a chance. Wolaroi
may not be forward enough for the trip. Panacre
will certainly do better than at Melbourne. Of
performers during the last two or three weeks nothing-
lias done so well as Dame Acre, who, if she gets
.away, can be looked for with the best when the line
is sighted. But whether she is good enough to see
?-n Sol , im, ' lun ~ n' l° right out must remain in doubt
till she does it. At Rosehill she had the last furlong-
all to herself. Satin Bird, winner of the last Epsom,
is doing well on the track and is something more
than a possibility. This writer will be expecting to
notice him at some stage of the proceedings and to
get a glimpse of Panacre, Cetigne, Wedding Day and
lah King. Of these it is not inconceivable that the
last may be first.
* * * *
There was a doubt when this was written
whether Wallace Isinglass would be a starter in
Sydney Cup, there being indications that Old King
Coal might prefer to give Prince Viridis a fly
and let the other interview Desert Gold again. It
doesn’t matter to this page anyhow. Never having-
had much time for Wallace it wouldn’t stand him
tor the Cup in any case. He has failed too often in
handicaps to inspire confidence now. Westcourt and
Kandos have been coming on well, and if nothing
went wrong during the past week should be some-
where in the picture. The others are a. mixed lot
which, so far as staying power goes, are mostly
rumor, and the remainder are burdened with weight,
i i'i nee Bardolph is an exception to the first remark,
though not to the last. Included in the field is a
little, pinched-up looking mare called Lady Liege,
with 6st. 111 b., who won over 10 furlongs at Band
wick on New Year’s Day. On that occasion it looked
as if she could have gone on indefinitely. If the
Cup happens to be run in the wet, 6st. 11 lb. might
be very handy. Otherwise Westcourt and Kandos
ought to live up to their reputations.
* * * \ *
Satin Bird was given a go in a welter
mile at the Hawkesbury meeting on Saturday and
ran as poorly as a mule. But there, is a substantial
difference _ between 9st. 51b. and Vst. 101 b., the
weight this nag has in the Doncaster. Farivale, a
Victorian, scrambled into x third place, but the Bird
was away astern.
* * * *
Frank E, another Doricasterite, did better.
He was beaten out of place over six furlongs by an
ordinary lot at Newcastle the previous week, and at
the Hawkesbury had to argue the point with top-
class sprinters like Rosedell, La Steppe and Delin-
aere. But that didn’t matter. Starting at 12 to 1
he touched off Delinacre by a head, La Steppe four
lengths away. That Frank can run a mile right out
has been explained at Randwick twice. Jt was a
good Doncaster trial.
* * *
There was nothing about Ivennaquhair’s
perlormance m winning the Hawkesbury Handicap
on Saturday to make the punter who backed some-
thing else for Sydney Cup feel sorry. The colt had
to be ridden right out to beat a second-rater. Even
granted that he be a slug, Kennaquhair will have
to do a long way better than this to win the Cup.
tic hasn t had any favors from the weight-fixer in
that event either.
*** . *
The ■ Welkin colt Volpi, who earned dis-
tinction at Rosehill by staying- behind the barrier
in one race and rushing off in a violent hurry with
the next, earned a long string of curses at the
Hawkesbury on Saturday. He was backed like a
certainty down to 5 to 4 on, played up at the
post as if possessed by numerous devils and ran
sourly all the-wav into second place. A tote div
of 4s._6d. enabled place bettors to lose ss. 6d. mi
each investment.
* * * *
At the Hawkesbury meeting the tote paid
more than one dividend in five races. In evierv
instance backers of the second horse lost money.
How much longer is this farce going to be endured?
Meanwhile what happened in one race is worth
recording as an illustration of what is occurring all
oyer the premises.. The winner -was backed in the
ring at 7’s and 4’s. Anyone who put a pound on
at the last figure drew £5 from Ike. But anyone
who backed first, second and third horses on the
tote, each with a. pound, drew £4 ss. 6d. There
weie 11 starters in /this particular event, yet the
tot , e ,. lS ™ n on a hit-headed system which makes the
public take shorter jbdds against picking three than
could be got next dqor against picking it in one.
“0.K.”: My idea is that Panacre and Pah
King are a likely pair for the Doncaster, where so
much depends on the draw for positions, and that
f"'° Blues and Blackwood are fairly in it for the
Sydney Cup. Panacre, who won the Epsom in 191(5,
eairving only 41b. less than his Doncaster load,
struck me as being short of condition when he ran a
respectable- third to Wedge and Desert Gold in the
futurity Stakes at Caulfield recently. Pah King
«ra good mile races on the last dav of the
v.K.C. meeting, winning one of them. Two Blues
met with a mishap in the Australian Cup, which
may spoil his Randwick chance; but he had previ-
ously performed quite brilliantly in beating Blaek-
wood who won the Autumn Handicap (13 furlongs)
at llemmgton in the style of a stayer. With only
n 7, j „ ,' s f- 41b - to carry, these two old stagers
should bold their own against the top weights. Onlv
twice in 26 years has the Cup winner carried 9st.
or more. Of the 30 placed in the last 10
years 19 had less than Sst. on their backs. It is
reasonable, then, to prefer the 7-stoners to the better-
class performers.
Tip-country battler Luckv Bean, second in
the Kyneton Cup (Vic.) the other dav, has a remark-
aide record m that race. He won it in 1914, was
second in 1915 and won it again the following’year.
Past year, when again fancied, lie declined to start
when the tapes flew up, and might have repeated the
performance on the recent anniversary had not a
hurdle been placed behind him at the start to pre-
vent him backing away from the barrier. He'went
off with the others this time and beat all but one

Maori land felt as sorry to hear of Desert
Cold being- beaten at Melbourne as if something had
happened to the price of the fat lamb. And in the
midst oi their misery several writers sat down to
revise their estimates of the lady. Perhaps Ibis
may have been desirable in any case, but there is
no need lor them to worry. Desert Gold is a very
beautiful mare, with considerably more courage
stamina and pace than two of the' nags she finished
behind. Nor is it at all certain that over the dis-
tance most favorable to Cetigne the mare would be
beaten in a weight-for-age trial. That over a
series of distances from six to 16 furlongs she is
the best animal racing in Australia to-dav scarcely
admits of argument. Certainly for Maoriianders to
claim that Biplane has greater stamina than Desert
, - « preposterous. It would do no harm to wait
until Biplane has been tested in that respect next
year. Ihe most that was ever claimed for Desert Gold
was that she was an exceptionally free-going, gener-
ous prad That can still stand. In spite of her
defeats she is one of the most brilliant and versa-
tne mokes the Commonwealth has known.
'A. ( nllinan, who has been making pocket-
money at the N.S.W. North Coast race meetings, put
m a pleasant afternoon at Coraki last; week riding
the winner of every event on the programme. A
couple, of days later he went on to Casino, and rode
two winners, two seconds and a third. Seven of the
eight winners were favorites, and, when last heard

across to the coast, a distance of 40 miles, each
horse carrying approximately (rider and gear) I7st.

4., wickets for 150 runs—the great averag-e of 3.71.
Ills best match, effort this season is 18 wickets for
runs against Kogarah B; and his string of per-
fortaances brought one of the four “passes” given by
the Sydney Cricket Ground Trustees. He swims and

•T. Smith (Glebe), who smote the onlv
century (101 against Petersham) in the last round
of Sydney cricket, is of the new generation. He
played in one match (36 against Sydney) last year;
this season, after starting badly with four runs in
three mmngs, he has accumulated 223 runs, aver-
S t'!?- A experience in the finer
points of the game and Smith should stop the best of
the trundlers from putting on airs.
"Troopering R.8.R.” : In mid-October we
rode out into the desert places near the Dead Sea, a
seemingly endless ride. With casual Australian
eonidence we went into waterless wastes, but the
engineers got the necessary moisture apparently
from nowhere. So well had Allenby kept his secret
that none knew what the end was to be. Then sud-
denly the British artillery was pounding at the
great limestone ridges that protected Beersheba, and
an A.L.H. Brigade was charging for six miles into
the rear—the climax of a great outflanking move-
ment. YV ith bayonets in their hands the Anzacs on
their splendid Australian horses carried the Turkish
trenches without a stop and in one great leap.
Jacko surrendered in thousands, and his dead littered
every road about the town. But there were horses
that baulked at the Turkish trench that day, and
among them was that of poor “Tibby” Cotter,
cricketer; a Turkish sniper had added his rider to
the roll of Australian heroes. “Tibby” lies in the
Beersheba Park, alongside the other Arizae dead, in
the shade of the sighing gums of his native land.
Ted Everett, of Waverley, is another
promising youth among the all-rounders in Svdnev
school athletics. At St. Pat’s sports he won the
100yds. (10 3-ssec., or 2yds. better than Bannister’s
recently), 22Pyds. (25see.) and broad jump (19ft.
ojm.), and was second in the 120yds. hurdles
Between whetting his appetite at Rugby and hand-
bail, Everett is doing well in the Christian Brothers’
classes.
Saturday closed the season for the 18-
footers which race in Port Jackson, one week
under tlie Sydney Flying Squadron and next

insist on being separate. The boats divided a;641

“Centurion”: If “Tupara” (B. 21/2/T8)
had read my par. about breech-loading rifles more
carefully lie would have seen that 1 was dealing with
breech-loaders and repeaters used in the American
< ivil War. The Spencer came later, but its peculiar
magazine, located in the butt, was a feature of sev-
eral contemporary European rifles, notably one used
lor a while by the Italian army. Like the Spencer,
they had an irremediable defect —the Joss of balance
according to whether the magazine was full or
empty. The modern military rifle has its magazine
just at the “point of balance,” whether il be Lee-
Enficld Mauser or Mannlicher. Another famous
breech-loader of the ’7o’s which I forgot to mention
was the Remington, both single shot and repeating.

and the Turks did great Work with it against the
Russians. The Egyptian army, under Hicks Pasha

fact, I am willing to raise the limit to 251 b. if given

Ralph de Palma, the American motor
clack, has now pulverised the world’s record for a
ho " rs ’ The previous best, an aggregate of
566 miles 589 yards, was accomplished on the Brook-
lands track (England) in 1913 by Cliassagne, Resta
and Lee-Guiness who took turns in driving a six-
cylinder Sunbeam car. De Palma, perched on his
12-cvmder Packliard, officially covered 616 miles on
tlie Sheepshead Bay track, New York, though, as he
drove very wide in each circuit measured as two
miles, the probability is that his actual mileage was
considerably more. His average speed during the
rush was 101 m.p.h., and in the first 60 minutes lie
was 110 miles nearer home. His stops amounted to
lomin. 20sec., and in that period he changed his
tyres eight times and also fed his exhausted machinery
with petrol and oil.
are ; I believe, about
1100 species of fish recorded from the Australian
seas, but it is remarkable how rarely line-fishers haul
out any but the more common kinds. A reason is
that many species, though they may be present, will
not accept a bait. During a long rock-hopping ex-
pel lence writer has only taken (of rare fishes) the
grotesque cockatoo-fish, a member of the morwong
family, and the scaly-fin, a dark brown, chubby little
chap resembling a sweep. These two fishqs arc verv sel-
dom hooked, though they are said to be fairly mimer-
ous on rocky grounds. Among fish east ashore on the
South Coast (N.S.W.) during heavy weather I’ve
found the rifle-fish (which is sometimes taken on the
Queensland coast, but is more common in the Indian
Ocean), many nannygai, parrot fish, gurnard (kur.iu
and the ordinary kind), ling-fish, sea-hedgeh6gs, flat-
head and a few'snapper. On one occasion I caught
in a moribund state, so that it could be taken by
hand, a black trevally, which is no relation of the
common trevally. This somewhat rare fish inhabits
more tropical waters, and was evidently out of its
latitude in the southern salt-lake in which it was
taken. D. G. Stead records the capture, near Senna-
s'lll (N.S.W.), of a luvarus fish, which is rare the
world over. The stranger had probably stranded
when in chase of food. It is said to run to 6ft. in
length, and to. weigh up to about 3cwt., while the
color is described as silvery salmon-pink.
“Huffin-Guffin”: “No eels west of the
Dividing: Range,” says “Wandi” (B. 3/l/’l8') Well
there were plenty in the Glenelg between 30 and 40
years ago. And the Glenelg rises on the west side
. Gra mpi an Range m Victoria and flows west
and south, and the Grampians are part of the Divide
I have caught eels in the Glenelg up to 41b or 51b’
weight and have seen them go 71b Old Harrv
Spurr of Harrow once got one on his line which he
thought was a calf! There are eels in the Wannon
nver, too, and in the Grange Creek (Hamilton), and
in neaiiy all the creeks and rivers in Western Vic
* * *
John Quill ’: Are there any codfish in
the rivers flowing east from the Divide in N. S.
ales. If so, are they in the same class as the
Murray cod and do they grow as big? If not, would
Muriay cod live in the eastern streams if introduced
to them ?
* * *
"J. Quill”: Let me dig my pen into “Gas-
bag” (B. 7/3/’18), who is inflated with the comfort-
ing idea that everything is well with the fish in the
Western (N.S.W.) rivers. It is quite true as he
states, that “there are heavy penalties for using nets
and cages,” but what’s the use of heavy penalties if
the offenders are not brought along to suffer them’
1 take the opportunity of informing “Gasbag” that
the rivers are not closed during breeding time, as he
asserts; they are declared closed, but few angler<
take any notice. They fish on with nets and cages
and cross-lines and every other sort of line from
years beginning to year’s end without so much as a
irown from the Fisheries Department. Can anvone
produce a single instance in which a fisherman' lias
been fined for fishing in the N. S. Wales Western
rivers during a closed season, or with illegal
implements? &

Australia is lacking n, freshwater fishes. Barring the
Murray cod and the freshwater catfish there are no
species of great economic value. The deficiency could
be made good by the introduction into suitable
streams of certain Kuropean and other freshwater
hsnos which are not (like brown, rainbow and Loch
Levon trout) very particular as to bait, and there-
fore easily caught.

Let Me Make You Stronger
and Healthier
by my perfectly natural and interesting- system of scientific
exercises.
Exercise is the natural stimulant of the body. It
strengthens every nerve, muscle and sinew. It expels all
impurities, and nourishes with rich, pure virile blood laden
with life-prolonging- oxygen.
BUT, in order to obtain these benefits, you must learn the
correct and scientific method of physical culture. You
cannot read until you’re taught—you cannot exercise
properly until you learn the correct methods!
My instruction will strongly appeal to you, on account of
its simplicity and the rapid results it secures. I aim at
building up the muscles, both internal and external, in a
thorough and scientific maimer. No one part is built up
at the expense of another, but your weak spots will have
special attention.
My Postal Course of Health
and Strength Culture
will bring von renewed health and strength. The exercises
you receive will be those most suited to your individual
physique, just as the particulars you furnish tell me you
require.
My booklet, entitled “HEALTH AND STRENGTH FROM
SELF-CULTURE,” tells all about my methods, fees, etc. I
should, like to send you a copy. Just write your name and
address across this advertisement, and send it to me, with
three penny stamps for postage. 1 will know what you

Things the Motorist
should Remember
9 n< r° f '/ our sma^est expenses—lubrication—is your
chief safeguard against your heaviest expense—depre-
ciation.
2. Friction is relentless.
The effects of the incorrect oil will not be apparent
during the first piston stroke or the second. But
when piston strokes run up into millions—and that
does not take long—friction begins to get its due.
You need not look for the effect of wear then. You
can hear it.
3. We have solved the problem of scientific lubrication.
4. If given intelligent care and scientific lubrication
your car should run better the 2000th mile than the
first.
5. No matter how freely a low quality or wrong-bodied
oil is used, it can never do the work of the correct
lubricant.
6. No one oil will suit all cars. This is absolute.
7. You selected a car that suits you. Now select an oil
that suits your car.
8. Though you may want correct lubrication, you will
seldom stumble on it by chance.
9- The Lubrication Chart, printed in part on the right,
was prepared only after an engineering analysis of
every car. It represents our professional advice, and
specifies the correct oil for your car.

Things couldn’t look much worse than that,

Aims and also to the very keen local com-
petition, which has necessitated additional
expenditure in securing business.” The four
big P icture People, West’s, Spencer’s, J. D.
W imams and Taits, formed a co. to buy or
rent films and show them ; and, as that co.
also hires out films, it has a long start in the
race with this and other competitors who
have to find hirers for all their films. Then
the bigeest film-producers got into direct
touch with Australian showmen; and that
cut away more ground. On top of that comes
the Australian producer—not very important
yet, but getting stronger every year, and deal-
ing direct with showmen. Meanwhile Europe
became far too busy about other things to
spare either time or material for much film
manufacture; and the American producer
knew what that meant. So all the competi-
tion seems to be at one end, which means,
for a co. like this, buying at the maximum
Price and selling at the minimum. Things
may improve when the guns cool and (he
European producers seek an outlet for their
goods. Meantime the shareholders, after
shivering at the results of the year’s trading,
won t get much comfort from the balance-
sheet. Share capital is £11,645, and the co.
owes £29,000. Against that the items stock-
in-trade, hire of films (paid in advance) and
estimated value of unexpired lease of hired
films run to £31.697; book debts are £7133.
and there are sundries £2376. The real
value of the bulk of the assets is very difficult
to determine; and the co. is carrying heavy
risks and getting nothing for it. Of course
if it pulls through a comparatively small
profit will pay a big dividend; but share-
holders must regard it as a gamble. It might
be better to back something for the Cup.
Present writer doesn’t know what Cup; but
there is sure to be one handy. This is Aus-
tralia.

. The output of Zeehan (Tas.) is now
limited to clean galena and tin ore. Quan-
tities and values are not disclosed. The local
paper, in reply to a question, said that “Offi-
cial information is withheld by the Govern-
ment Departments concerned.” Yet with lead
at £29 and silver at 3s. 6d. to 45., there are,
according to Mt. Lyell Co.’s experts and the
Government geologists, about 1,200,000 tons,
containing gold and silver and lead, worth
about £6,000,000, blocked out but lying idle.
Lessees of the mines containing these values
are_ encouraged to let them so lie, till the
various hydro-electric schemes are in opera-
tion—probably in the next generation. Mean-
while we and the Allies want the gold, silver
and lead. These can be produced at Zeehan
now, without waiting for a hydro-electric
scheme to extract the zinc. In the past
they. were smelted at Zeehan, and the zinc
left in the slag dump ; zinc in said dump, by
the way, is estimated at anything up to
£700,000. Those smelters, with silver at
2s. 2d. and lead at £l2 10s., made in one
year, according to the Tas. Government
auditor, £14,000 over actual treatment costs,
though, through using that sum in improve-
ments and alterations, the balance-sheet
showed a loss. This eventually led the
Anglo-Hun proprietary into debt, and the
Tas. Government became a mortgagee
for £20,000 on security of the plant,
but allowed the Kaiser, through his
agents, the Deutsche Bank, to advance
another £22,000, and so obtain a controlling
interest in the mortgage. This has taken
three and a half years to fix up, and now the
Tas. Government is offering the smelters,
dump and mining properties "of the old Anglo-
Hun co. as a whole, or in separate portions,
by tender.
In the past the co. smelted refractory ores
containing 28 p.c. zinc at a charge of from
50s. to £3 4s. per ton, on a sliding scale
varying with the amount of silver, lead and
gold associated with the zinc. The mines of
Zeehan and Dundas supplied the fluxes,
which also contain silver and lead. The cos.
and tributors received 7s. or more per ton net
on the mines, and made good profits. Those
fluxes are at present metal prices worth two
and three times, as much as they used to be.
Costs have not risen in nearly the same
proportion. Thus, on paper, any purchaser
of these smelters with a knowledge of his
business has a reasonable proposition before
him. Meantime the mines which contain
•only fluxes and second-grade lead and silver
ore lie idle, and Zeehan’s creditors and mort-
gagees live only in hopes of the good times
promised when Lyell hydro-electric schemes
fructify—“after the war”—and the
£10,000,000 of lead, zinc, gold, copper and
silver in the Read-Rosebery and other mines
of the Zeehan, Dundas and Farrell districts
are made into bullion.

H. E. Evenden. who has been prospecting
around Cox’s Bight and Port Davey for the
Speck Government, scratched up some
molybdenite and ruby tin near the Bight,
enough to make some of his crowd peg out
an 80-acre section in this once-rushed but
disappointing country. He swears, too, that
he found bitumen caught inside wire-netting
that he put across the mouth of a creek at
Port Davey. This bitumen figured in the
mild Port Davey oil boom, extinct for a
couple of years. Cautious people then wanted
to know if it had not drifted in from outside.
Evenden thinks his netting disposed of that
idea, anyway, but does not claim to have
thrown any other light on its origin.
Queensland gold yields still sag. During
January and February last year 26,6400 z.
worth £113,159 were got; for the past two
months, 21,9510 z., worth £93,242.

The Beale Player-Piano
excels in Tone-Control
Every tone-nuance, from full double forte to faintly-sounded
pianissimo, can be expressed on the Beale Player Piano.
It is this wonderful tone control which permits of exquisite,
personal rendering of each composition played. All the
fire and sparkle are fully revealed awakening the mind
to beauties which would lie hidden forever under a fumb-
ling hand-technique.
Insist on a Player-Piano “with perfect tone-control, and you
will inevitably choose a “Beale.”

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character ) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped ,
Aame and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
E. J.K.: It won’t do. Plainly those notes
would have no value outside Australia; since thev could
not be cashed for gold, which is the basis of
international business dealings. Therefore thev
would be kept in Australia, and gold and the
notes that could be cashed for gold would have a
superior value, because they could do something
which the other couldn’t. The storekeeper who would
want 10 sovereigns for an article would require
11 or perhaps 12 of the notes which he oouldn’t
( augt for gold. It looks easy to raise interest-free
loans by turning the handle of a machine and print-
ing notes; but if the notes are in excess of the
amount strictly required for circulation, somebody
pays. In the instance quoted above, somebody who
took the notes at full face value would find presently
that they had depreciated. That really is the
interest that the loan costs that individual....
Dementia P.: If it’s a true yarn you should have
made it credible by indicating where it happened.
559: The paper was thinking about New Guinea,
no doubt.. . .D.G.M.: No doubt true; but it might
just as easily be a fake paragraph. Why not give
the name of the man who did it? That would
make all the difference Sub.: The money has been
returned to the sender in every case we have heard
of N.M.: “Smith” doesn’t excite us V.M.:
Ihmes feeling there, but you don’t quite get it.
J.M.: It doesn’t work.... J. 11 .: Correct enough
and not unpleasing. All the verses want is origi-
nality and punch. .. . F.J.F.: Avaunt. Also begone.
.. . .E.C.D.: Nicely done but doesn’t get far
M.8.P.: Misses R.S.: Cut those “Bees” down,
give the verse a rub and make it the short, good
thing it might be. .. .S.A.V.: Don’t worry about an
extra syllable or two here and there. They sim-
plify its rejection M. 8.5.: Shocking. ... K.W.:
Sorry not up. .. . J.D.P.: The weary basket gaped for
it.... Birregurra: Two mysteries remain. How could
the kid get into the pub with the police about, and
how did the man get drunk if he hadn’t the beer?
....A. E. Aitch: No; the yarn doesn’t get hold of
ps F.H.: “Dead Soldier” spoils himself by weari-
some repetition. .. .A. T.: Very poor attempts....
Fanuela: Weak little verse in danger of arrest for
“having no lawful visißle.” E. 8.: Why is the
piompting of nature” only to be in the American
language?... .Le Chat Noir: Won't do. .. .J.T.H.:
Poor little thing if.A.: It is too clumsy
1 ( .G.: No use. .. . J.J.C.: Not good enough by a long,
long way.... Jim F.: No. .. .D.L.W.: Not enough
meat. . . .Henry A.: Jiggettv-jiggetty-jiggetty-jog-
and says nothing. ...C.C.D. : You must get more
thought into the verse.... J.C.: Too slight. .. .R.G.:
No room here; but it might be actable J.M.M.:
No. . .Fantail: There are two ways of doing it. Either
you can put your head through the doorway and say
what you’ve got to say; or you can do an orna-
mental cakewalk across the street and then wink
from there. On the whole, we like the first style
best. There’s less chance of mistaking what it is
you want to convey to the reader. .. .J.R.; Mild ser-
mon on stockings and legs. It saddens- u 5....
L.F.C.: An idea there; but you’ll have to get a
sense of metre. . . .C.O’Q.: Parodies are poor things
at best, and yours are about at worst T. 0.:
“Sand” verse not up. . . .O.B.: We let the thing loose
on the enemy :
Now, as you all know, the world is in sin and crime,
To have this war which is burning like lime;
For if it wasn’t for those deep cursed swine
We would be living in luxuries with honey and wine.
But now, as you will see, it’s hard for us to plea,
That we are fighting the devils o’er the sea ;
But we will conquer, and we’ll let them see
That we are the conquerors of land and sea.
So when this battle is finished and won,
May the devils know that we are one ;
That there will never be any more Huns ;
To apply their infurnell and darnest guns.
Now may the Huns read these lines and bow,
To think that we were never their foe;
But may they live to learn and know,
That we are out to win, so that the world will glow.
Gypsy: Not up M.S.: The repetition of the
rhyme “life” spoils a thing as small as that J.N.:
“Orders” nicely done; but not quite enough meat.
. ...W.L.: Verse not up. “New Firm” not our style.
....Mary Ellen: Nothing there. .. .N.R.F.: Vivid in
places, but too long-drawn-out. .. .A.8.C.: “Fortune
Teller” good of its kind, but hardly what we want.
.....J.G.: Your fears for “Cuttaburra Joe” were jus-
tified... .Red Ned: Not enough there. .. .Tinpot
Bill: “The Wombat’” doesn't make a yarn....
R.N.C.: No. . . .L.E.W.: Sample of how not to do it.
8.G.8.: No use trying that thin stuff here....
A.G.M.: Stodge... .C.H.T.: Not nearly up....Nemo:
You can’t rhyme “charming” with “embalming” and
“purpose” with “circus” in this paper.

J.D.8.: Homeward bound.... Hyra: Can’t use it.

ticular application and the rough sketch wouldn’t

The small boy looks like a nervous emu.. ..T.S.:
Decent beginner’s stuff. Peg away and don’t expect

the gag is so long that it is almost a short story. .. .

“R.A.Y.”: This Win-the-War Govern-
ment doesn’t do things by halves. When the
row broke out a receiving-office in N. S. Wales
was in charge of an old German, who also
carried the mails per horse and sulky to and
from the nearest post-office. He was re-
ported for having expressed himself in favor
of the Hun war policy, and the Government,
having presumably found the charge proved,
took the postal job off his hands. But it
wasn’t taken out of his house or his family.
It was given to the Hun’s wife, who is only
half German. The old lady can’t drive a
sulky, and hubby was forbidden to carry the
mail; but he accompanies the missus and
drives, while she protects the bags from pos-
sible capture by the enemy. Presumably,
also, hubby assists hep to sort and make up
mails, as there is no one else in the house to
do it.

Longer Wear-Better Service-Less Cost
It is common knowledge in engineer-
ing practice that the edged material
conveyed by belts in mining and
smelting plants cuts the unprotected
surface and soon wears out the
cheap uncovered belt.
When the Goodyear Conveyor Belt
was designed for this service, it
was designed so as to give not only
service at a lower cost but better
service.
The reinforced cover on all Good-
year Conveyor Belt adds to the life
of the belt because it resists cutting
and abrasion.
This cover is also waterproof, and because
rubber is forced into the fibre of the canvas at
enormous pressure the belt is impervious to
moisture throughout.
Ordinary belts wear out quickly at the edges
because of the friction against the troughing
rollers.
The Goodyear Conveyor Belt is provided
with a patent cushion edge to withstand the
hardest kind of frictional and cutting wear.
And the stretch has been taken out to the utmost
limit of sound practice.
There will be no loss of efficiency—of power —be-
cause of stretch.
The price may be higher, but for every shilling
expended you will get longer service—and better
service.
\
Put a section of Goodyear Belting into a Con-
veyor equipment and mark its solid lasting qualities
under the same service conditions in comparison
with any other belting of like size and weight.

TYRE.

THE “COLO”
is the latest Tyre on the market, and
we say, in all sincerity, it is THE BEST.
BECAUSE
1. It is made of the purest Para rubber,
with chemical admixtures scientifically
prescribed to secure the best results.
2. The canvas is made specially to our
order, and is the best that money can
buy.
3. The various processes are conducted by
operatives of the highest skill, under
expert supervision.
4. The “COLO” gives the maximum of
resiliency with the minimum of deprecia-
tion.
5. The “COLO” is procurable in ALL
SIZES.
6. The “COLO” is GUARANTEED to do
a 3000-miles run, and averages consider-
ably more.
7. The “COLO” is SPECIALLY BUILT
for the rough roads which are the rule
in Australia.
8. The “COLO” is made by an Australian
Company, employing Australian work-
men.
9. What any tyre will do EVERY “COLO”
can do —and better.
10. “COLO” service is not service on paper.
It is service on the hills and mountain-
sides ; it is service in the mud and sand.
11. No matter what your destination —
funeral, race meeting, or whatever it
may be —“COLO” tyres will get you
there on time.
12. The “COLO” as a reliable, serviceable
and economical tyre, cannot be im-
proved upon.

“Cockaigne”: George Alexander, just
dead, began as draper’s assistant, like Tom-
linson, known as Walter Montgomery.
Though the singer died over three years
ago thd lawyers are still worrying over Nor-
dica’s will. The latest news is that a sale of
some of the diva’s jewels has been ordered by
Chancellor Walker, of New Jersey, “to meet
expenses incidental to the administration of
the estate.” As the value of the trinkets has
been officially appraised at £44,300, the job
is likely to last for some time yet.
“First Old Man”: These are strenuous
times for play-producers in Australia. All
of them, I note, are taking turns at grease-
painting their faces and producing themselves
before the footlights. E. W. Morrison, after
“Aladdin,” at Sydney
Palace.
Bert Barton as
Magician.
several years of
“resting,” is in his
old part in “Within

Barnum, after
staging a score of
plays here, recently
made his bow as a
mummer in “The

Harry Burcher, of
the musical-comedy
world, is seen tak-
v ing a part in
“You’re in Love” ;
Gaston Mervale is
showing in “Turn

a case of pipe all
hands, and (I pre-
sume ) save a salary !
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: James Patrick
West, over whom North Ash spoke affec-
tionate words of farewell last week in
Waverley Cemetery, was about the last of
our old school of actors. A native of
Parramatta, born Devine, in the mid-’fifties
he was associated with an amateur club
which gave perrormances in an iron building
in Sussex-street, between Market and Druitt
streets. About the same time Andy Dono-
hoe (subsequently re-christened Shiel
Barry by W. 11. Ford and J. P. West)
appeared as an amateur, and they became
pros, almost simultaneously. J. P. West
in his nearly sixty years had played a multi-
tude of parts —most of them parts that called
for lung power. In his later years he
prided himself greatly upon his perform-
ance of the cannibal in Alfred Dampier’s
“For the Term of His Natural Life” at the
old Gaiety; but he had really done better
things than that. Latterly when opportunity
offered (which was too rarely) the old actor
coached amateurs and gave lessons in elo-
cution and the dramatic art.
“Peter”: Muriel Starr with all her
“gyurls” was never adored like Nellie Bram-
ley, one of the Fuller heroines in Melbourne.
Every evening Nellie is rushed and is not
allowed to escape after merely spluttering
her thanks. She has to kiss all the babies
and distribute sweet words among the wait-
ing mammas, besides suffering the panting
proximity of a bodyguard all the way home
to her hotel. At the pub door there is an-
other protracted farewell, more dishevelled
speech, and more unanimous decision to em-
brace Ellen all together, followed by a final
wrench from the more exuberant who want
to chase her up to bed. It is a great life for
a star, but it is too reminiscent of her
struggles with the fast Roger Ilardface in
“The Clot on the Camisole” to give her the
pleasure of a new sensation.
“C. Ockney”: Though debonair George
“Robinson Crusoe,” at
Melbourne Bijou.
Nellie Kolle as
Principal Boy.
Alexander (born
Sampson) who died
in England the
other day may not
have been a great
actor, he deserves
the adjective as a
manager. After
Wyndham he was
certainly the most
consistently suc-
cessful. But where-
as Wyndham made
most of his money
out of adaptations
from the French,
Alexander was
more inclined to
back the home-
grown dramatist,
and his judgment
was rarely at fault.
At his St. James’s
playhouse the best
of Pinero, Jones
and Carton saw the
light and scored
long runs. The
theatre was opened
with a play by
Carton, and its
final p r o d u c tion
under Alexander
was a thing by
Louis N. Parker.
He was 60 when he was called.
Laura Roberts, with her husband, Charley
Taylor, and a small parcel of Australian
natives, leaves for America in the course of
a few days. Laura was Sarah in Bert
Bailey’s “On Our Selection,” and she has
handled many parts neatly and brightly and
piquantly. She and her husband (long con-
ductor of the Bailey-Grant orchestra, but
also an experienced vaudevillain) are going
into variety in New York.
“Snell”: The East Lynne Dramatic Co.
was filling a date in the course of its tri-
umphant progress through the smalls of
Western District (Vic.). The only avail-
able accommodation within the limits of the
finances of Hannibal Nasturtium, the gifted
actor-manager, was in the home of Augustus
Dunn, mixed farmer. Dunn farmed honey,
butter, eggs, fruit, spuds and maize, and the
greatest of these was eggs. Hens were all
over everyone, and right into everything.
Mr. 11. Nasturtium, in the hope of securing
a rebate on the board bill, gallantly pre-
sented Mrs. Augustus Dunn with a “stiff”
for “self and family,” assuming that the
family was all in sight at the time of writ-
ing. Judge the managerial amazement on
surveying the house that night to find
eleven Dunns occupying the front seats. The
Augustus Dunns had raked up all their near
and remote relations, and ushered them in
on the strength of that “self and family”
clause, and in Mrs. Dunn’s lap purred the
domestic cat, and next to Augustus Dunn
was perched his collie dog Spot. Cold with
fury and regardless of consequences, Hanni-
bal stepped out before the curtain. A com-
manding hand stilled the orchestra at the
small, portable piano, and then in his frost-
iest tones the actor-manager addressed the
Dunns. “I am afraid, Mr. Dunn,” he said,
“you have misunderstood me. When I gave
you that pass I imposed no limitations.
For God’s sake go and bring the chickens.”
“ALADDIN,” AT SYDNEY PALACE.
Abanazar Lupino, pill vendor, and assistant
“ Georgia ” (Leslie Donaghey).
“Spreader”: At a Sydney suburban ’all
lately they dished up a farce called “Dockem-
street, Wo'olloomooloo.” It was billed as a
revue, and Jack Kearns made all the middle-
aged sports in the audience hark back to the
days when Rickards first got going in the
Garrick, now the Tivoli. Kearns sang a
song that Charlie Fanning first introduced
at .the Tivoli, “Wid me dook, wid me mud-
hook, wid me claw.” Some of the old Syd-
ney push dialect is introduced and makes a
big hit. But “I’ve chucked up the Push for
the Donah” was the Carbine of the lot.
. “T. 0.1.”: Word is wandering around
among the papers about a programme, on
exhibition somewhere, of the G. V. Brooke
performance in Sydney which started the
Captain Cook statue fund. The facts are
that in 1855 Brooke and Coppin agreed to
give one-third of the receipts of two even-
ings’ performances to start this fund. The
amount realised was £lOB. On his return
in the following year Brooke found that no
additions had been made to it, so he and Cop-
pin decided that the committee should hand
the amount, with interest added, in all £ll4,
to some charity. The Destitute Children’s
Asylum was selected and the amount handed
over.
“O.B.”: Thais Lawton, whom the Taits
are showing with Post in “The Masquerader”
next month, has a Portia to her credit that
haughty Boston vows is the best it has yet
inspected. Also her Beatrice in “Much
Ado” and her Rosalind in “As You Like It”
appear to have caused hoorays in Bhaks-
pearean shrines. Thais has done, in addition,
Paula Tanqueray, Dorothy A’ernon, Nell
Gwyn, Maslova (of Tolstoi’s “Resurrec-
tion” ) and several other modern heroines;
so she ought to he fully qualified for her
comparatively easy job in the version of
Katherine Thurston’s dead novel.
The improvements at Sydney Lyceum,
recently leased to Hoyt’s for picture pur-
poses, are designed on the lines of the Strand
Theatre, New York. It will have a mezza-
nine floor, or second circle, to be used as a
foyer. Downstairs floor is to be covered
with ruberoid, in the interests of silence.
In the completely-reformed house Hoyt’s will
instal a more-or-less musical instrument to
cost £8000; but if it is anything like the
machine at the same co.’s Mosman Ivinema it
will be a shame to take the money.
“8.J.” : Maggie Moore (much more nowa-
days) will in due course be introduced to the
pictures. H. R. Roberts is at present
at work on scenarios of “Struck Oil” and
“Judy O’Trot,” which will be photographed
when his wife has finished her present
engagement with the Muriel Starr co. Mean-
while the lady is compiling her memoirs.
“Peter”: I doubt “Ancient Prompter’s”
statement (B. 34/3/T8) that Nat Goodwin
“has been married and divorced more times
than any man on the boards.” Nat recently
met in N’York another well-known mummer
whose rushes to the altar and the Divorce
Court had been more numerous and sudden.
Nat gazed at his rival with great awe, and
then said in a voice hoarse with emotion :
“My God, Greasepaint, you are a glutton for
punishment.”
“The Ancient”: In Albury, back in ’7O.
“While London Sleeps” was being staged at
the School of Arts. Mrs. Holloway,/ the
heroine, was gently and pathetically depart-
ing this life, while the snow fell to soft music
about her. A close observer might have seen
that the snow was desiccated newspaper;
but the audience remained unenlightened
and sniffling, until an unfortunate slip
allowed a whole sheet of the Albury Banner
to flutter gently down upon the dying beauty.
“Sylvia D.”: Some of our Australian films
are crude things. The other night I went
to see one replete with all the usual thrills,
including a hand-to-hand encounter with a
shark. The acting at times degenerated
into burlesque, and frequent printed explana-
tions on the screen were necessary to enable
one to follow the plot. Now, people don’t go
to theatres to read ; and if our moving-pic-
ture industry is to boom our camera acting
and production must be improved until there’s
no need for words to tell the story.
TO DAPHNE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, Daphne has a tender heart
Most loving-kind, and yet she labors
By day and night with fiendish art
To agonise the frenzied neighbors;
For thickest walls are all too thin.
When Daphne plays the violin.
Not Torquemada and his band
Could be more lacking in compassion;
No plea for mercy stays her hand,
For violins are all the fashion;
With dauntless will and courage high
She’ll learn, though every neighbor die.
She lifts it lightly from its case,
Wee dimples through her roses flying,
And tucks the chin-piece into place,
With studious care each posture trying;
Then round her tiny hand she brings
And draws the bow across the strings.
And oh! the horrid sounds that rend
The shudd’ring air like demons yowling,
Or shrill, lugubrious draughts that wend
Through crooked chimneys wildly howling!
And ugh! The sudden scrapes that grate >
Like rusty nails upon a slate!
Some day she hopes to make it speak ;
Meanwhile, alas! we wilt and languish,
Unnerved by its appalling shriek,
In bitter throes of aural anguish.
Yet all who know her loudly cry:
“Dear Daphne wouldn’t hurt a fly!”
Sweet maid, whose steely soul belies
The softness of angelic features,
Withdraw from undeserving flies
That ruth and heed your fellow creatures.
Forbearance every charm endears;
You have our hearts, oh spare our ears!
VICTORIA.
SYD. C.
THE DRAMATIC AD
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Some recent productions have been mainly ads.”
— Film-trade journal.
I went into a picture-show, and gazed upon the
screen:
I watched the magic shadows flit and twirl;
And first I saw a “close-up” of the smiling Movie
Queen,
And got some private news about the girl:
May Power
Uses our
Dental Cream that makes your teeth do every-
thing but curl.
The hero stormed the lady ! s heart with vows of love
sincere.
With tears of joy her eyes began to leak.
While smouldering fires of passion camouflaged the
atmosphere,
The silent screen was thus allowed to speak:
Young Man,
Here’s a plan !
Buy your home at Bilson’s and pay half a
crown a week.
The hero had a wrathful fit. Throughout a thousand
feet
lie chased the blokes by motor, train and horse.
The fight was most conclusive, and the villain in
retreat
Was offered this to temper his remorse:
You mug,
Be a pug.!
Learn to box like Johnson by the Basher
postal course.
Supreme, in chapter five, the parted lovers’ faith
arose.
A rope around the villain’s neck was hung;
Though virtue was triumphant, yet the picture
couldn’t close
Without an ad. as in the air he swung:
Anoint
That stiff joint.
Sniffles* 1 Salve for twists and sprains is on the
topmost rung.

Permanence
When an institution, almost from its in-
ception, takes the commanding position in its
field —
And when that institution maintains the
commanding position without interruption
•over a series of years^
Then you may be assured of that institu-
tion’s integrity—both as to its product and
its dealings withf the public.
From an annual output of 465 motor cars
nine years ago The Willys-Overland Com-
pany has grown steadily, and this year its
dealers have contracted for more than 200,000
motor cars.
Its net resources have grown m that time
from a little more than £lO,OOO to more than
£13,600,000.
This year the Willys-Overland factories
are building the most comprehensive range
of models ever -produced by any. one motor
car concern.
If yours is a family of average size, you
will be particularly • interested in either the
Big Four-cylinder Overland touring car, fin-
ished in a rich brown, or the Light Four
touring car, finished in gray. These two
models exemplify the remarkable values char-
acteristic of the entire group.
When you buy any motor car in the Willys-
Overland group you are assured by our com-
manding position in the industry—by our
unequaled facilities and resources—of integ-
rity of values in your motor car throughout
the whole period of its performance in your
service.

Why Have Grey Hair?
Few people know that grey hair is not a
necessary feature of age—that it can be
avoided without resorting to hair dyes. A
very old, home-made remedy will turn the
hai» back to a natural color in a few days.
It is only necessary to get from the chemist
two ounces of concentrate; of tammalite and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply
this simple lotion to the hair for a few nights
with a small sponge and you will soon have
the pleasure of seeing the greyness disappear.
This recipe is perfectly harmless, is neither
sticky nor greasy and has given perfect satis-
faction for many generations to those in
possession of the secret.
Blackheads, Oily Pores, etc.
The new sparkling face-bath treatment rids
the; skin of blackheads, oiliness and enlarged
pores almost instantly. It is perfectly harm-
less,*, pjeasant and immediately effective. All
yod ‘have to do is to drop a stymol tablet,
obtained from the chemist, in a glass of hot
water, and after the resulting effervescence
lias subsided dab the affected portions of the
face freely with the liquid. When you dry
the face you will find that the blackheads
come right off on the towel, the large pores
contract and efface themselves and the greasi-
ness is all gone, leaving the skin smooth, soft
and cool. This treatment should be repeated
a few times at intervals of several davs in
order to make sure that the result shall be
permanent.
The Magnetism of Beautiful Hair.
Beautiful hair adds immensely to the per-
sonal magnetism of both men and women.
Actresses and,smart women are ever on the
look out for any harmless thing that will in-
crease the natural beauty of their hair. The
latest method is to use pure stallax as a sham-
poo on account of the peculiar glossy, fluffy
and wavy effect which it leaves. As stallax
has never been used much for this purpose it
comes to the chemist only in Jib. sealed origi-
nal packages, enough for 25 or 30 shampoos.
A teaspoonful of the fragrant stallax gran-
ules, dissolved in a cup of hot water, is more
than sufficient for each shampoo. It is very
beneficial and stimulating to the hair apart
from its beautifying effect.
How to Remove a Bad Complexion.
Cosmetics can never really help a poor com-
plexion; often they are positively harmful,
ihe sensible, rational way is to actually re-
move the thin veil of stifling, half-dead scarf-
skin from the face, and give the fresh, vigor-
ous and beautiful young skin underneath a
chance to show itself and to breathe.
This is best done in a very simple way, by
merely applying mercolised wax at night, like
cold cream, and washing it off in the morning
Good mercolized wax can be obtained from
any well-stocked chemist. It absorbs the dis-
figuring cuticle gradually and harmlessly,
leaving a brilliant natural complexion. Of
course, this also takes with it all such facial
blemises as red blotches, tan, moth patches,
sallowness, liver spots, pimples, etc. As a
freckle remover and general complexion beau-
tiher this old-fashioned remedy is unequalled.
The Powder Puff Passes.
Every normal woman is always interested
m any plan by which she can quicklv enhance
her beauty, provided' the plan is perfectly safe
and simple. Ever since the discovery that
ordinary cleminite, such as any chemist can
supply, is an instantaneous and harmless
beautifier, there has been a growing demand
for it from smart women everywhere. They
usually get about an ounce and add just
enough water to dissolve it. A little of this
perfectly harmless lotion gives a beautiful
complexion to any face instantly. It renders
face powder quite unnecessary. Moreover, its
use cannot be detected. The skin is instantly
beautified but appears perfectly natural
under the closest scrutiny. [3

“Opal Ring”: The operator at Stringy-
bark received a telegram which was muti-
lated, and instead of sending the formal
memo., “Yours John Jones. Please supply
second text,” lie woke up the operator at
the Titree end Avith “Yours John Jones.
W hat happened to uncle?” Titree looked up
the message, and tapped back, “Uncle died.”
The same old policy of hide and shuffle !
The military anti-drink Commission sat at
Adelaide and learned this from a doctor who
had 12 mouths’ experience in charge of a
camp:—
Since 1916, 895 men were discharged- from the
camp as unfit. Alcohol accounted for eight of the
lost soldiers. More men were lost on account of
venereal disease than by reason of alcohol.
But while the figures for the Big Disease
were given, the figures for the Biggest Dis-
ease didn’t appear. Why must not the com-
munity know the facts?
“Quidam”: Russia is large in things
besides revolutions. Going to the mining
districts on the Lena one gets about 1500
miles from a railway station : but the gold is
there when you reach it. One million cubic
yards from the Blagoveschensky cut has
yielded £3,000,000, or £3 10s. Od. per cubic
yard, while the average value up and down
the river is about 30s. per yard. Working
conditions are very primitive; also Russia,
instead of installing drastic legislation to
prevent gold-stealing, on the lines of (say)
the Victorian Gold Buyers Act, provides
that companies must buy all “God-sent”
gold from miners. “God-sent” is a pleasant
way of putting it. A large part of the cos.’
expenditure goes in paying police to watch
the workmen. As there isn’t anybody to
watch the police, it probably costs more than
if the cos. took their chances.
“Ex-Englishman”: Would you believe that
anyone as unworldly as this could live?
My wife’s father is an English country vicar
and a staunch Blue-ribbon man (he doesn’t
like the name “teetotaller”). But his daugh-
ters are. not so particular, especially where
the Christmas dinner is concerned, and last
December they put into the sauce for the
plum-pudding a generous tablespoonful of
the proper flavoring. His wife writes, in
innocent glee at the deception—evidently eat-
ing the accursed stuff with a spoon must be
less sinful than drinking it—that father,
Avith no idea of what had been done, seemed
to like the unusual taste, and “actually had
two helpings of the b —y sauce.” Now, just
try to fancy the primitive simplicity of an
old lady who (1) thinks the mere name of
brandy too awful to be written in full, and
(2) has no glimmering of an idea that the
contraction she has chosen might possibly
be read otherwise.
“K.L.H.” : Though he has more than his
share of ignorant critics, the doctor is little
different from any other craftsman ; the most
successful is he who best satisfies his cus-
tomers by completely and expeditiously cur-
ing their ailments. Most ailments become
manifest to the patient himself before any
objective symptoms develop by which the
medical man could detect them ; so prophy-
lactic treatment or early treatment of the
disease depends upon the patient himself
seeking medical assistance before the disease
grips him. “A.H.AJs” attitude towards
operations (B. 28/2/’18) is characteristic of
a large section of the public. I have been
accused of being “too fond of the knife”
because I performed seven operations in the
first month I struck a certain country prac-
tice ; the 173 other cases seen and not
operated on were not heard of by my critics.
There is, hoAvever, a very real objection to
any man doing only lodge practice, and Mel-
bourne masses will soon experience it. The
man who confines himself to lodge practice
must have many families on his list to mane
a decent living; then, being rushed, he Avill
discourage people with minor ailments, with
the result that in many cases what should
have been treated as a bad cold yesterday
will be visited as pneumonia the day after
to-morrow.
“John Ketch”: Says the M.L. Times of
February 18 : —•
Apropos of the death sentence passed on William
Eggers McMahon. An Otago Daily Times reporter
was informed that the person who will officiate as
hangman is. a prosperous South Island farmer. He
acted in a similar capacity when Bennier was hanged
recently, and when he received the fee deducted his
expenses, and handed the balance to the Patriotic
Society in the district where the execution took place.
The public-spirited conduct of the hangman-
agriculturist of the South Island—a true
sportsman and an artist for art’s sake —
gives me hope that the reasonableness of a
suggestion Ayhich I have wanted to make
for a long time may lead to its adoption in
Australia. The pleasant spectacles which
take place from time to time at Long Bay,
Melbourne, Boggo-road. Adelaide. Hobart
and Fremantle Gaols, in the ea'rly forenoons
appointed for dislocating the necks of mal-
efactors, have hitherto been wastefully ex-
clusive. None but a few bored pressmen
and a handful of officials have been per-
mitted to witness them. What would be
the matter with arranging for executions to
take place in the Town Hall, charging 55.,
2s. and Is. for admission, and donating the
money realised to, let us say, the Lord
Mayor’s Patriotic Fund? When old Dar-
linghurst Gaol was thrown open for in-
spection, at a shilling a time, in 1914, some
30,000 citizens hastened to visit the joyous
place, and the gallows was the centre of
attraction. Photographs showed its plat-
form thronged with ladies, gentlemen and
dear little children. I am sure the Lord
Mayor would haA r e to put out “House Full”
long before the Sheriff gave his cue to the
hangman. The City Organist could supply
appropriate airs whilst the ceremony was
in progress—which would doubtless greatly
stimulate the gentleman playing the star
part, and would do away with that atmo-
sphere of gloom Avhieh pervades the twilight
of “B” Hall at Long Bay when a trapdoor
performance is staged. If the picture rights
were auctioned beforehand a further sub-
stantial sum might be raised. I would like
to say, in the event of this suggestion com-
mending itself to the authorities, that I
would be willing to give my services for
nothing, and would be glad to pay my own
expenses.

To suffer with fortitude is
heroic, but to suffer needlessly
is idiotic. While most sufferers
regard pain as due to the
dispensation of Providence,
doctors see in it a certain
neglect—the neglect of simple
rules of health.
/*"\F ail rheumatic afflictions acute lumbago is the
most painful. It arises from a gradual accumu-
lation of excess uric acid in the system ; the muscles of
the lower back become impregnated until the muscu-

“E. J.M.”: A cheery little publication,
Round tiie Map, was produced on a hos-
pital ship which brought a recent cargo of
invalided men for all Australian ports. It
was edited by Sergeant Boyd (S. M.
Herald), and the drawings, which displayed
a very promising trick of caricature, were
done by Private Cyril Samuels (Evening
News). Near the Nelson Monument, while
on leave, Boyd met the late Major Hoskins,
of the 20th Battalion, to which he also
belonged. He was getting ready to salute,
when he noticed that Hoskins was without
the crown on his shoulders, so he said
“What’s this?” Hoskins replied: “My boy,
I’m having the time of my life as a simple
private.” Boyd eyed the Major and re-
marked, “Don’t you think as you’ve elected
to be a private that you should stand to
attention when talking to a sergeant?” Hos-
kins : “Quite right, my boy, and, according
to Regulations, a sergeant shouldn’t walk
down the street with a private? But, as we
are beastly Australians, we’ll do it.” Poor
Hoskins, beloved by his men, was killed at
Polygon Wood. Boyd got his ticket for Aus-
tralia at bloody Bullecourt.

another while squatting in the sand by the
Canal, a third while his lot was in the Desert,
got a supply of paper at the Cape and
livened an invalids’ ship with a fourth, and, on
the way to France for his second round with
Fritz, produced his fifth- —all, of course, with
different titles suited to the circumstances.

CRAYFISH AND GIRL.
(In disrespectful imitation of some modern verse.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A little moon, with wink and nod,
Was dancing on the waves.
(After three drinks, it’s really odd,
The way the moon behaves.)**
It shone upon the midnight sea,
Whose wavelets turned to pearl,
And spared a curious glance for Me,
The Crayfish and the Old
We knew we’d missed the latest tram.
We knew the sands were wet.
We did not care a little damn,
But lit a cigarette.
The pink girl smoked Abdullah brand*,
I had a common fag.
(The crayfish slumbered on the sand,
Inside a paper bag.)
And nothing happened, right or wrong;
We did not even kiss.
It starts all right, your crayfish song,
But fades away like this.
Poor puppets of a phantom race,
When canny pressmen call,
We fill so-many lines of space.
We were not real at all l
You’ve heard that story lots of times;
But, while you stand the strain,
And swallow anything that rhymes,
I’ll sing the same again.
Yes, till my brain all work has struck,
I’ll hand you what you wish,
And afterwards, as well, with luck,
The Damsel and the Fish.
I never sit on midnight sands
(Rheumatic gout forbids) ;
I never hold a damsel’s hands
(I have a wife and kids) ;
I do not care for things like these;
I loathe the taste of cray;
What matter, so my piffle please
The fancy of the day?

IMPORTANT.—LOOK TO YOUR TEETH.
There are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, comfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifically prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

GIVES NATURAL BEAUTY TO SKIN & HAIR.
That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot be imitated can be obtained
by regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary Toilet Soaps do not. assert
this influence. Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry the skin and
destroy its delicate texture. Even the best of such soaps can only cleanse; they cannot
heal and protect the skin. Rexona Soap contains the same soothing-, healing, antiseptic
balsams as Rexona the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment of skin
affections is known throughout the world. Simply use Rexona Skin and Facial Soap
regularly once or twice a day, and see if it does not quickly soothe and cleanse the
pores, lessen the tendency to pimples, and leave the complexion clear, fresh and
velvety. Price 1/- per tablet.

Youth’s Road.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE’S a Red Road, and a hard road,
Where many pilgrims throng ;
And they who made that Red Road
Have done the world a wrong.
For the young man and the brave man
There is no other way ;
They sing adown its red length,
And find the going gay.
Yet the green road, and the smooth road
We trod ourselves in youth,
Is not for them ; for the Red Road
AVas made for them, in truth.
From the long street, and the bush track,
And old familiar scenes,
They haste away to the Red Road,
And all the Red Road means.
And ’tis up hill, and ’tis down hill,
It keeps its forthright track ;
Though hands wave, and the heart sigh,
There is no turning back.
And ’tis footworn, and ’tis tear-wet,
And stretches wan and wide,
And many a young and fond heart
Is breaking by its side.
Like a dull rain and a low wind
At night on limb and leaf,
The tears sound and the sobs rise
Of women bowed by grief.
Nor the fine word nor the fair word
Of how they fought and fell
Will take the tears from the sad eyes
Of those who love so well.
Yet the bright youths, and the brave youths,
Though night and darkness fall,
When all ends on the Red Road,
They have no grief at all.
’Tis the olcL folk, and the fond folk,
That bear the grievous load—
A black curse on the black hearts
That made that cruel road !
Oh, the big men and the proud men
Who did this crying crime,
’Tis hate, sure, and a world’s hate,
They’ll bear all time !

RODERIC QUINN.
The Song of the Sword.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[Both Irish and Scottish Gaelic traditions have
many references to lost song's of magical power.]
The great room of a small castle in Ireland.
The walls are of rough stone, broken only
by three long, narrow windows set close
together. There are settles and stools about
the room, and near the windows is a large
oaken table. At this Derniot is seated with
pens and parchments. He is engrossed in
his work and does not notice either the
movements of people in the castle nor the
noise of battle without.
Phelim and Moran come in.
Phelim : It is mad he is, surely, with bend-
ing too long over old songs, and him not
heeding the Sasenach outside.
Moran : Will we try to say a word to him
t° get him away from the books and the
writing? _,lf he would put on his sword
it is great .fighting he would make below
the gate.
Phelim : Con is there and 50 with him, hold-
ing them back to keep them from
putting fire to the walls; but if Dermot
would go there himself, it is his sword
would break them altogether.
Moran ( going doubtfully to Dermot) :
There is hard fighting at the gate and
some men killed. Will you not leave the
words you want to write for a short while,
for ’tis you have the great arm?
Dermot : I will go down surely soon. There
is a word to ket here, and a thought that
came to me in the first light of the morn-
ing to write down for singing; but it will
soon be done.
He bends again over the parchment and
Moran walks slowly away.
Phelim : ’Tis no use speaking a word
to him, for he will have his own way if we
are all killed with the place burning on
us. What noise is that?
Hour men come in bearing a dead body
under a, blood-stained cloth. They set the
body down on the ground. Dermot does
not turn his head. Croghan comes in and
stands with bent head looking down at the
body. Then he strides to Dermot.
Croghan : It is Con that is killed below the
gate and the men not able to stand against
the Sasenach.
Dermot : It is a word or two that I must
put down.
Croghan : Is it mad you are to sit with a
look on you and me going back to die
while you put ink on a foolish bit of skin?
Dermot : It will be done soon.
Croghan : It will be done soon, surely. It
will be done with long arrows and hot
fire; and this place your father built
strong broken down and the cattle driven
and us with no name at all in the whole
world.
Dermot : I will be down to the fighting
when it is done; and it will keep me
from doing it if you stay here talking all
the long day.
Croghan : Let every man follow me back to
the fighting. It is Dermot that will not
lead us, though it is his own walls they
would burn.
Theft all go out. Dermot still bends over
his work. Outside the noise increases and
shouts are heard close at hand. Dineen, a
very old man, comes in, leaning on a stick.
He pauses to look at the body of Con and
goes on to Dermot, behind whose chair he
stands. Dermot works on unheeding.
Dineen : It is a black day and men dying.
Have you no sword that you hold nothing
but a goose feather?
Dermot ( starting) : Och, Dineen, it was
your voice behind me broke the sound of
a line. It is this word I must have and
no other. Do you go away now and I
will be down very soon to the fighting.
Dineen goes out slowly and Dermot bends
again over the table. An. arrow flics in at
the window and passes over his shoulder,
but he does not heed it. The shouting out-
side increases. A great stone strikes the
wall without and shakes the building. Der-
mot leaps to his feet.
Dermot : Is it no quiet a man can have at
all? Three times was the word that came
to me on the point of my pen and three
times has it gone away.
He sits down again, his head bowed
between his hands. Dineen comes in with
Murna. She is ■a beautiful young girl, but
her face is pale and. her disordered hair falls
wildly about her shoulders. Dineen stands
back leaning on his stick while Murna runs
to Dermot.
Murna : Och, Dermot, why are you sitting
with a pen, and them going to burn the
house over us? There are men dead below
and blood on the stones and the arrows
shooting in. It is you only can save us.
Dermot : Whisht, little sister. I nearly have
the word, and it the great word in all
the world. It is the song Amergin made
in far days and that Caithbad lost in a
river valley of Antrim. It is the i great
song, surely, if I can get that word.
Murna: Och, what song would it be?
Dermot : It is the Song of the Sword that
is more than all the swords of the world ;
and it is the one word I need to say it
in the faces of the Sasenach.
Murna : It is the fire I smell and the one
word of death that is come to us all.
Dermot : I have it! I have it!
Murna: Och, look out and see. It is your
sword you must get, or it will be too
late. V
She runs to the ivindow.
Dermot (rising with the parchment in his
hand ) : I have it! I have it!
Murna : Och, Dermot! ,
She falls back from the window, an arrow
in her breast.
Dermot : The curse upon their Black hearts!
They have killed my little sister. Murna,
Murna!
He takes the dying girl in his arms, then
lays her back gently on the long settle.
Dineen : Och, the black day! .
Dermot : The curse upon their black hearts!
Where is my sword?
He rushes wildly out.
Phelim comes in wounded.
Phelim : Where is Dermot?
Dineen : He is away to get his sword.
Phelim : Bad cess to the Sasenach. They
have my arm cut, and me not able to close
my hand on the hilt. It is a grand day
surely, and him with his foolish song not
there when we needed him.
DiNeen : It is the song that he has now,
surely—the Song of the Sword that Amer-
gin made and Caithbad lost in Antrim. It
is the song that makes the foe fall down
and takes the point off the long arrows.
. He will say that word at the gate, and
there will be no more fighting.
Phelim : Is it the Song of the Sword surely ?
Dineen : It is the lost words he has found.
Phelim : Och, then it is a good day; for
they are making the fires now and the
arrows as thick as leaves blowing before
the first of the snow.
Dermot comes in armed. He goes over to
the body of Murna.
Dermot : Little sister, there will be blood for
your blood and a great killing for the thing
that is done this day. I am going out
with my sword to the gate.
Dineen : It is the song—the song! Where
are the words that are found again?
Phelim : Och, Dermot, the Song of the
Sword—where is it?
Dermot : Is it words I would go out with
to them that in black shame killed my
little sister? It is the blood on her breast
calls for a s\yord and not a song.
He goes out. The noise of the fighting in-
creases. A glow of fire is seen through the
ivindow.
Dineen : He will have his own way with all
men of every sort. It is sore wounds and
death he will be making now with the
Sasenach.
Phelim : There is a smell of burping coming
from the west side. The fighting is going
hard, and me with my arm cut.
Dineen : It is sorry I am he would not take
the Song of the Sword with him, for it is
a great thing to have the words that will
do more than all the fighting.
Phelim : I would count his own sword as
good as any old song, and it made by
Amergin himself.
Dineen : He has a great arm, and the voice
of him in battle is like the sound of the
loud sea.
Phelim : It is a great way he has and no
fear at all; but my heart is sore that he
lost the good time finding the song that he
would not say.
Dineen ( walking to the table) : Could we
find the words that he has written?
Four men bear in the body of Dermot. It
is covered in a cloth that is red with blood.
They set it on the floor beside the body of
Con, and Croghan staggers in and kneels
beside it. He is wounded in the head and
side.
Croghan : It was a great sword, surely, and
it cutting swathes of men like oats in the
full harvest.
Dineen : It is the Song of the Sword if I
could find it to say the words.
He fumbles among the narchments on the
table. The glare of the fire increases and the
smoke blows throiigh the roorp.
Croghan : It is a prayer that is better to
say, for the fire is at us on every side.
Dineen : No, but I have it! I have it!
Croghan : Well, read it to the fire. It will
maybe listen.
The flames break through. Dineen falls
coughing in the smoke.

EP
The kidneys are the blood-filters of
the body, and when they are clogged
they keep back the liquid waste and
impurities from the blood, so that the
body fills with water. This is called
dropsy, and it is a very dangerous
disease.
Your danger begins when there are
sharp pains in the back, puffy swell-
ings beneath the eyes or in the ankles,
sick headaches, nervousness and flutter-
ing heart.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are
a special kidney medicine—they have
one set purpose —to relieve, tone up
and strengthen the kidneys, and they
do not affect the bowels at all. This
kidney medicine —the genuine Doan’s
—dissolves the crystallised uric-acid
which clogs the kidneys, bladder and
connecting passages, and in this way
removes and cures the cause of dropsy,
diabetes, Bright’s disease, stone,
cystitis (inflammation of the bladder)
and urinary disorders. It is because
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cure
the CAUSE of disease that cures are
LASTING.

Cured to Stay Cured.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
FROM BALMAIN.
Mrs. W. Briggs, Store, 19 Vincent Street, Balmain,
Sydney, says:—“l was suddenly seized with sharp,
shooting pains across the small of my back. At first
I thought they would soon go away, but this was not
the case; they got worse instead of better, and I soon
found I was. suffering so acutely that when I stooped
or moved quickly I could scarcely help screaming out.
Dizzy attacks began to trouble-me, and I always felt
tired and. languid, having no energy for anything. My
rest at night was disturbed, as I could not lie in one
position for any length of time on account of the
constant pain. Nothing I took did me any good, but
at last I got Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and they
acted splendidly, four bottles restoring me to perfect
health. Several years have elapsed since my cure,
but I have had no return of my old complaint, so I
feel I am safe in saying I am cured for good.”
Mrs. Briggs confirms the above two years later: —
“I have had no reason to alter my good opinion of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They permanently
cured me, and I strongly recommend them to other
sufferers.”
FROM THE CITY.
Mr. Jas. Wilson, 17 Little Buckingham Street,
Sydney, says“ For a long time I suffered torture
from backache and kidney trouble. The pains in my
back were very severe, and I have been so bad that I
could not attend to my work, as every movement caused
positive torture. The kidney secretions were affected,
being thick and cloudy, and containing a red sediment.
I was also subject to dizzy feelings and could not sleep
properly at night. Nothing I took seemed able to give
me any permanent relief, but one day when I was
feeling very bad I heard good reports of Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, so I sent for some and, after taking
seven bottles, I was cured. This remedy not only
banished the backache, but strengthened and toned up
my kidneys, and improved my general health. It is
two years since I was cured, and I have had no
trouble with my kidneys since.”
Mr. Wilson confirms the above four years later: —
“I am still well and have had no return of backache
and kidney trouble since Doan’s Pills cured me six
years ago.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WOLSELEY AVENUE is a handsome
name, but Wolseley Avenue is in
reality a most unhandsome tho-
roughfare. It is narrow and grimy, with an
unnecessary bend in its middle, as though, at
some early stage of its career, it had been
kicked in the stomach by a mere street. One
side of the Avenue is lined with cottages
which hug one another for support. Privacy
Avas left out of the builder’s calculations, for
anyone standing on the 3xlo verandah of
No. 36 can look straight down the row to the
frayed doormat of No. 12. If so disposed,
the vendors of milk and other necessaries of
life mav walk straight up the line of veran-
dahs, for the dividing fences are less than
three feet high. Wolseley’s youngsters, in-
deed, know of no other mode of transhipment
than by vaulting these absurd hurdles from
A to Z. '
Great cracks traverse the grimy brick
faces of Dahlia Row further on. Green
patches border their foundations. Their
iron gates, set in crumbling concrete, creak
rustily at the touch of every hand. Facing
Dahlia Row is the skimpiest, meanest, ugli-
est nightmare of a terrace.ever born in the
brain of a money-grabbing jerrybuilder. Yet
it has individuality at least in name, as
witness “Floraville,” “The Elms,” “Irene,”
“The Anbhorage.” One facing a dusty right-
of-way, wherein you may always rely on
finding at least one dead rat, bears the label
“Fairview.” Another seems to bear the bar
sinister —it is nameless; it stands back a
couple of feet as if in a mutinous mood. Or
perhaps a homing drunk shoved it astern with
his latchkey whilst lunging at the Yale lock.
Anyhow, by its step back it gained a few
extra inches in front, and in that fluffy strip
of dust a double-stemmed palm grows dustily.
The twin trunks rise in crooked unity, with
long, untidy strips of dead fibre rustling
miserably about them. It bears an absurd
resemblance to a bow-legged Afghan in a
ragged petticoat and a tattered turban.
It is a brooding street which seems always
to be awaiting the Crack of Doom. Yet, as
a plain matter of fact, Doomsday is nothing
to the precarious and warlike Wolselevites.
They await much greater calamities—the bad-
debt collector, the time-payment fiend, the
coining or the van which is . to carry away
the furnishings .ere the agent can seize them.
When in a hopeful mood they dream vaguely
of “a stroke of luck,”' “a lift” or “a loan.” .
To the casual and unsympathetic eye life
in this street- must seem a tedious horror.
Yet its habitues have excitements and diver-
sions quite unknown to the solvent. Take
Monday, for instance. During the morning
hours every Wolseleyite worthy of the name
experiences the thrill the rabbit gets when lie
hears the hysterical yelps of. the dog that is
scratching madly at the entrance of its bur-
row. For Monday is the field-day of the
dun. Out of the dusty hurricane of trade
that sweeps the main street, different samples
of dun wheel into the Avenue’s mournful and
Suspicious calm. First comes one grim of
eye and ruthless of jaw. lie is ’“the Kent,”
and, if money can be drawn from an insol-
vent Wolseieyite, he is the man for the
operation. Some can evade payment no
longer: they meet him with dog-eared rent-
hooks and surrender the coin reluctantly, as
commanders of captured fortresses tender
their useless swords. But where evasion is
still being practised, “the Kent,” after bat-
tering ruthlessly oil immovable front doors,
seavchingly tours the barricaded hack regions,
where the besieged are sitting tight and hold-
ing • their breath, lueu. returning to the
front, he sometimes affixes a notice to quit to
the door and retreats in good order, leaving
the unlinaneial wretches inside to think over
and curse the situation.
Other duns are going the rounds by now,
briskly rattling the knockers, tugging the
bell-handles and sliding in horrible slips of
paper covered with final-notice threats and
pathetic appeals. When at last there comes
a lull, the beleaguered garrisons heave sighs
of relief and start to move about again like
free human beings. Some, greatly daring (or
perhaps they are throwing up the sponge),
come out to “do” the verandahs with old
brooms curled up at their business ends like
the moustaches of a dragoon, and get un
neighborly discussions with other human mice
about the neighbors who are still under lock
and key. These poor wretches, sneaking out
presently to remove the shameful “notice to
quit” proclamations from the doors, are
neatly caught by the wily “Kent” wheeling
suddenly back on his quarry from some
hiding-place round the corner. When the.
Monday enemy is expected, even the harm-
less non-combatant gets no quarter from the
Wolseieyite. And it is the bad hour of
Monday morning when a smart young man
with a leather bag and a spruce “Do It
Now” air invades the street. He is' of the
Gas Company’s staff, and his monthly col-
lecting-day happens this time to coincide
with that of the dreaded “Kent.” So his
cheerful rat-tat-tat fails to rouse anyone.
Blinds everywhere are down, windows sealed,
children muzzled. The few playing about iu
the dry gutters have but one answer to every
inquiry relating to the lady of the house :
“She ain’t in.”
“I’m not ‘the Rent,’ sonny,” says Do It
Now in his kindest manner. But the kid
only stares at him. He turns and bellows
through the keyhole, ‘'Gas!” There is no
response.
“Tell your mother that ‘Gas’ is waiting,
will you, Sis ?.... Here ! You can see for
yourself that I’m only the Gas !” He opens
and shows his bag of pence as guarantee, and
the satisfied kid hurries away to procure him
his passport. At last news of his identity
filters through the street, and he is given the
freedom of the kitchens and allowed to wipe
his hair on the grimy hall curtains. As fast
as possible, for he is a fastidious young man,
he empties the slots of their month’s pence,
relocks them, gives one horrified glance at
tlxe unwashed dishes and the grime, and bolts
for the open. But at the faded door of
Maida Vale the angel of light experiences a
setback.
The Peter who bars the portal of this
earthly paradise is an oily person whose
shirt consists mostly of button. ''She ain’t
in,” he growls, indicating the smoky interior
of the den. "An’ I’m re-sponsible and carn’t
let anybody through.”
Bo It Now mechanically gives his pass-
word, ‘ Gas!”
‘‘You might be,” agrees the oily man. “On
the other ’and, you might be c’lecting for the
time-payments, or you might be the chap
about th’ di’mond ring. ’Twasn’t with no
consent o’ mine she took it on.”
As the oilv one seems doubtful and still
disinclined to shift, he is suddenly shouldered
aside and the brisk collector reaches the
kitchen, where, as certain awful fumes have
already proclaimed, “she” is most flagrantly
“in” and scorching chops on the breakfast
cooker.
As swiftly as possible he does his duty to
his employers, replaces the slot against a
background of ragged wallpaper, and bolts for
the door. II is head appears presently over
the dividing fence of “next door.” which he
has discovered to be empty. The vanished
tenant has rifled the slot and left no clue.
Do It Now desires most earnestly to track
them. lie tries to apply the third degree to
the initiates’ of Maida Vale ; but those bandits
withdrawing swiftly one by one, it proves a
one-sided and unsatisfactory proceeding. So,
with a philosophic “Nothing doing!” he goes
his way.
But not through loyalty to the defaulters
has Maida Vale remained dumb ; the simple
explanation is that another dun with a very
square jaw is.battering at the front door. He
may be the diamond ring arrears, or possibly
he is the enlarged photograph Nemesis. So
the. ragged refugees, eat their scorched pieal
while the foe batters impotently.
“Seems an impatient kind of bloke,” mut-
ters the oily man as he gnaws. “Ain’t ’s if
we’d owed it long neither.”
“Owed wot long?” whispers his unkempt
wife.
“I dunno! Th’ di’mond ring, or th’ kid's
insurance, or me suit, or whatever ’e’s c’lect-
ing for!” And they chew in silence while
the-man outside tries his strength and pati-
ence with the knocker.
Do It Now, who has inquired tirelessly
since he left “next door,” presently gets wind
of the slot thieves from Mrs. Sam Saunders,
a vast and voluble lady of color. “It’s a
thing as I wouldn’t stoop to meself, nor
Saunders neither, though ’e is in the plumber-
ing hne,” says Mrs. Sam virtuously. “Oh.
but they was a queer lot! not the sort as I
care to mix with, though I hope not un-
neighborly.” Then the eager gas angel is
asked to take an interest in young Sam’s
horoscope. “I’ve put him to the bricklay-
ering, ”. says his mother, who- seems to have
a passion for collecting odd “so
that byu'mby ’im an’ ’is ole man can be
parteners.”
Young Sam, with a face like a black pansy
and feet like tennis racquets, indicates Mrs.
Farnan, two doors down, as one likely to
supply latest news from the front regarding
the thieves. “ ’Er ole man lent ’em ’is ’and-
cart ter shift,” he says informatively. How-
ever, it turns out that Mrs. Farnan who
up to now has been visibly framed in an
open window and surrounded with babes,
like some submerged Madonna framed in a
cloud of smutty cherubim, objects to turn
informer, and" slams down the window almost
on the chin of the inquiring collector.
Meanwhile the prowling duns harry the
shiftless and goad the insolvent. Several
meeting by chance upon a doorstep make
bets as to their chances of getting payment
from those within. The sad gig of the time-
payment undertaker stands empty while his
black collector nags for instalments over-
due upon the funeral of some unfortunate
one who has for ever escaped the day of the
earthly dun.
. By midday the strain slackens, for even
duns must dine. Then the Wolseleyites
rejoice and breathe again. Peeping from
behind dusty blinds, they see the Avenue
empty save for the time-payment sewing-
machine canvassers, who, seemingly, needing
neither food nor rest, thrust greedy faces
into any house that is opened to them, and
do their villainous best to lure their fasci-
nated listeners further into the quagmire of
debt.
Next to enter the Avenue of the hopeless
are three suburban she-saints.- They pause
at No. 20 Dahlia Row. No. 20, who looks
well nourished, has but a poor tale to tell—
“hard times,” “him” discouraged, children
“that sick.” She has scruples about admit-
ting the visitors, but they will not be denied.
No. .20 has accepted the two-pound loaf of
charity, therefore she has no right to privacy.
Such nonsense!
But No. 20 does not object to them enter-
ing the ruinous place on the score of pride.
She has all the cunning of the experienced
cadger and merely holds them up while “tli’
boss” hides,his sporting paper and the beer,
and assumes the proper careworn look of the
deserving unemployed. She talks loudly so
that fast scouts may be sent out to head off
'Myrtle and May. who are now entering the
Avenue with a basket of pickles and tinned
dainties, bought with a win at last night's
two-up, a gamble in which “th’ boss” excels.
While No. 20 is fighting her rearguard
action the tenants at Ozone are making pre-
parations for flight this very night before
the baffled agent shall have regained his wind
tor to-morrow's bombardment. When neces-
sity arises, the Wolseleyites rival the tent-
folding Arab in the quality of silence. Is
“the Rent” importunate? Is- local credit
quite Then, hey presto! up and
away! “Real” walnut sideboards- are
hoisted softly upon handcarts; familv
enlargements are lifted from the places of
honor; bedding, tied up in table covers, is
bumped along the hall, and, without beat of
drum, the owner turns the key in the lock
and is swallowed up in the unknown.

“Nerves”
Our nerves are similar to an intri-
cate network of telegraph wires.
Controlled and nourished by a
portion of the brain —known as
the nerve centres —the delicate
threadlike nerves radiate in all
directions throughout the body.
So long as the nerve centres are
capable of continually supplying
nourishment to the nerves, the
nerves will remain strong and
healthy. But directly the nerve
centres become weakened by
overwork, worry or anxiety, they
are unable to transmit the
necessary nourishment, and the
nerves become worn out and
“on edge.” Then it is that a sud-
den sound makes you “ jump ”
—you get irritable —you suffer
from neuralgia—you are rest-
less and depressed. In this con-
dition there is nothing to equal
