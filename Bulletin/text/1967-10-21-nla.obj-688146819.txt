at the end of the rainbow: a pot of black
Black is the combination of all colours. In the rainbow
above they’re separated by the Thin Layer Chromato-
graphy techniques.
This is the newest overseas method of identifying
antioxidants used in modern rubber compounding. So
Australian Carbon Black has introduced the apparatus
here to assist the rubber industry in this specialised
field of organic chemical identification.
Even though A.C.B. makes only the carbon black that
is an ingredient in most things rubber, we go to every
known length to ensure that it meets exacting speci-
fications.
So when a manufacturer or compounder comes to
us for black, he knows that it has been subjected
to every quality control test available.
We’ve eight years’ experience behind us as suppliers
of furnace black. And that experience adds up to tech-
nical know-how, better service and definite economies.
So next time you think of black, think of us. Could
be your pot of gold.

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
The risks of
tending
phlox by night
WE HAVEN’T MANY world’s bests
around here, but we have always clung
to two thoughts—that Flinders Street
Railway Station is the world’s busiest
and that Melbourne has the purest and
most splendid water supply. Merci-
fully, Flinders Street Station continues
to be shocking, but we are terribly
worried about our water supply. We
have even been threatened that, come
the summer, the water, for periods, may
be turned off altogether.
All this will be very bad for our repu-
tation. The general belief in Sydney
is that the Arctic Circle passes through
Australia slightly south of Wangaratta,
that Melbourne exists in what is known
as the chilblain belt, and that we have
signs on our number-plates “the Um-
brella State.” The wretched truth is
that Melbourne’s average rainfall is
25.95 inches, the sort of fall Sydney
can score in three days, and we have
had so much sunshine this winter we are
considering changing the name of St.
Kilda to Sunstroke Strip. The Prime
Minister also has been under the water
at Portsea more than a month ahead
of schedule.
The purpose of this exercise is to
tell you about water restrictions in
Melbourne, because this is something
that hardly ever happens. We are hav-
ing what is being described as the worst
drought in history and the flow into
reservoirs this year has been only 36
percent of normal.
These are the restrictions at the
moment with threats of worse to come.
Sprinklers are totally banned. We can
hand-hold our hoses between 6 a.m.
and 9 a.m. and between 5.30 and 8.30
p.m. car washing is out. Filling and
topping-up of swimming-pools is out.
This is a real tragedy around the
nobler suburbs of Toorak, Kew, and
Beaumaris. Fountains also are out, even
highly mechanised affairs that regurgi-
tate the same water. It. is felt that even
if used water is being regurgitated this
would have a bad psychological effect
on the populace. It wouldn’t do for the
citizens to see water being idly thrown
about.
Henry Bucks, the polite men’s store
in Collins Street, has been running an
advertising campaign offering every kind
of raincoat and umbrella with the idea
of “shaming the heavens into providing
torrents of rain.” So far the good god
up there has been only slightly shamed
by Messrs. Henry Bucks, the showers
have been only meagre. Every day the
newspapers have been running little
charts which have been quite as ex-
citing as a daily Test cricket score. For
example, the one in front of me reads:
Rainfall over catchment area nil. Con-
sumption yesterday 114 million gallons.
Quantity held in storage yesterday
36,972 million gallons. Quantity at
6 a.m. today 36,982 million. Storage
gain ten million. So one wipes one’s
brow: “Good grief, we just kept in
front.”
Patriotic newspapers have been ask-
ing for water-saving hints. Mrs. J.
Henderson, of Doncaster Road, Don-
caster, wrote: “I save time by taking
my toddler into the shower with me.”
This reminded one of the protest but-
ton: Conserve water; shower with a
friend. A lady at Mount Eliza pointed
out that believers in the old rule that
you should never boil water twice
could follow her plan. Once the water
was cold again she always poured it
over her pot-plants. A gentleman at
Moorabbin always emptied his hot-
water bag on his geraniums.
Then Mr. Frank Doherty, of the Wine
Bureau, reminded us in one of the
newspapers that the English wine expert
Edgar Penning-Rowsell for the past 25
years had always cleaned his teeth with
Riesling, and during that time there had
been no cause to visit a dentist for a
filling or an extraction. This, indeed, is
an important contribution to the water
problem and now we are waiting for
that newspaper’s wine writer, Walter
James, to advise us on the best teeth-
cleaning Rieslings. Should we have a
nice fruity Riesling from the Hunter?
“Natural gas, anyone?”

A clean acid Riesling, as used by
Edgar Penning-Rowsell? Meanwhile, as
we await this information the best clubs
in Collins Street are doing without ice
blocks in their scotch.
Hints have come from unexpected
quarters. Colin Willman, of the Trades
Hall, has invented a most ingenious
idea: a connection that housewives can
join on to the outlet pipe of their
washing machines and thus on to their
garden hoses. This way housewives can
save up to 70 gallons a wash. But there’s
a worry here. Peter Alston, the “Age”
gardening writer, told us that your
bath water was probably all right for
the plants but not the kitchen and
laundry stuff. Modern detergents,
bleaches, and caustic rinses could do
serious harm to your plants. It is up to
someone like Colgate Palmolive to save
us now with a garden-pure safe deter-
gent. Future advertising copy might
read: “Keep your White Pearl rhodo-
dendron whiter than white with safe
Zipp detergent.”
So until we get this detergent Mr.
Alston is telling us all to mulch at once
with heavy use of compost, leafmould,
lawn clippings, sawdust, and he is even
urging us all to hunt the beaches for
seaweed.
For the first time in 50 years there
has been a rush to buy 1000-gallon
tanks for use in suburban Melbourne.
And there is very real worry with the
bowling clubs and the Lawn Tennis
Association as to what they will do for
green courts this summer.
Mr. Douglas Wilkie, of the “Sun,”
warned that inevitably there would be
sly watering from irresponsible citizens,
and who knows how many would
“steal out after dark with a sprinkler
to tend their phlox by night.”
But wait! While appealing to our
loyalty and team spirit, the Board of
Works has warned us that their 360
employees, all in plain clothes, will be
watching and the fine is anything up
to $4O. Furthermore, the first lady to
be caught was dobbed in by her neigh-
bor. She just turned on her sprinkler
while she hung out her washing and, 10,
within a matter of minutes two Board
of Works inspectors were on her back
lawn. Yes, citizen is watching citizen.
It is an unhealthy situation.
The Government is under attack
from the State Opposition for not hav-
ing planned to cope with this unpre-
cedented situation. One letter writer to
the “Herald” put it in .sensible Mel-
burnian terms: “I can imagine what an
outcry there would be if football were
rationed instead of water. There would
be a demand for a Royal Commission.”
Actually, the Board of Works is one
of our more efficient organisations and
it does have ideas for increasing water
storage quite considerably, but at the
same time it would have been tactful
if it had left the message off the
front of the water-rate notices, par-
ticularly as it had increased its charges
considerably.
The message read: PLANNING

It’s "Sidewinder", the revolutionary new
ducting for Vulcan heaters. And cleverly
processed Alcoa aluminium makes the
heating system just about the quietest
thing in your home.
As warm air is circulated at speeds
higher than normal through the insulated
aluminium ducting, noise (a major problem
until now) is absorbed through thousands
of tiny perforations in the aluminium.
The faster flow of heated air and
the elimination of noise add considerably
to your comfort.
There are several good reasons why
Vulcan chose Alcoa aluminium. The
metal's ductility, for one. The aluminium
ducting is so flexible it curves around
obstructions under floor level without
having.to be specially bent or hand-fitted.
This speeds installation and cuts costs.
Aluminium is heat reflective, too, so
there’s a minimum of heat loss on the
way to your furthest room.
And since aluminium resists corrosion,
the ducting system can be fitted and
forgotten. It's maintenance free.
Vulcan has a good idea; versatile Alcoa
aluminium makes it practical.

ON THE
MARGIN
Fair author is
foul and
foul is fair
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
A CURIOUS FEATURE of the
modern approach to literature is the
increased interest in the appearance of
authors. The jackets of books often
carry the author’s photograph, some-
times blown up to cover the whole
of the back. I have been studying
these pictures of authors for years,
and as a result have been able to
formulate a theory. It is, I think, a
contribution of some importance to
literary criticism. It is simply this: the
better-looking the author, the worse
the book.
There are, of course, exceptions. I
do not deny that Byron looked un-
usually Byronic. But the general
principle holds. If the jacket reveals
that the author is a tanned, handsome
young man with a good head of hair,
you are pretty safe in giving his work
a miss. With female writers the prog-
nosis is still more reliable. I do not
know of any first-rate book, whether
fiction or fact, that has been written
by a stunningly beautiful girl. Anyone
who chooses his reading on the score
of jacket-glamor is apt to be stuck
with something terrible like the auto-
biography of Eva Gabor.
The literary occupation by its very
nature corrodes any endearing young
charms with which the practitioner
may once have been endowed. The in-
door, sedentary routine, the hours over
the typewriter, the exasperated drinks
at the end of the day are inimical to
glowing, all-over freshness. There is
also thinking to be done; and as Shake-
speare noted, thought makes people
look pale and sickly.
This applies with equal force to those
who write for newspapers and maga-
zines. Some years ago the “New York
Times” was stricken with the wild
notion that it should promote itself by
printing photographs of members of its
staff. The results were most disturbing.
Portraits of some of America’s ablest
journalists showed bald, fleshy men
gazing hopelessly through enormous
spectacles. The campaign was soon
abandoned, no doubt in response to
many requests from disillusioned read-
ers. It would be improper to comment
here on the experiment of The Bulletin
in revealing some of its contributors
for public inspection, except to say that
the pasty-faced impersonation of a pro-
moter of vending-machine companies
which appears at the top of this column
has not noticeably won me any friends.
In the book-publishing world, the
growing emphasis on the photogenic
qualities of authors has ominous impli-
cations for literature.
Mrs. S., a woman of 32, lately sub-
mitted a novel for consideration. The
publisher’s editor invited her to call at
his office. When she arrived, he seated
her in a good light and looked at her
from several angles.
“You have quite good bone-structure,
Mrs. 5.,” he said thoughtfully.
“Thank you,” she replied. “And how
did you like my book?”
“Your book? Oh, a very interesting
biography. But I’m afraid your face is
rather too round. And I’m not happy
about your hair being done in that
bun.”
“Excuse me, but my book is not a
biography. It’s fiction.”
“Is it? I beg your pardon. Mrs. S.,
I’ll be frank with you. We can’t pub-
lish your book. If you could lose about
a stone and change to one of the new
shoulder-length hairstyles, you might
have a promising literary future. Till
then, we’re not interested . . .”
Miss Dolly Wilkins, of the Dolly
Wilkins School of Grooming, has
several authors among her pupils. She
told me: “I believe one of them, a red-
head, is a potential best-seller. She only
needs a collaborator to write her auto-
biography.”
It is all part of the new doctrine
that things are better if they are associ-
ated with beautiful people. A pernicious
example is the publishing of recipes
recommended by lovely actresses. These
dishes are most unpalatable. I put my
trust in plain cooks and plain authors.
A novel has just been written by
the alluring blonde movie star Diane
Cilento. I have avoided reading it, and
friends who have done so assure me
that my decision was wise. On the other
hand, the publishing house of Collins
has sent me an impressive photograph
of Winston Graham, author of the
novel “The Walking Stick.” Half-bald,
he has bags under his eyes like a basset
hound, crow’s feet, and an air of total
disenchantment. I shall try to get hold
of Mr. Graham’s novel. He looks as if
he could write.


HEAT
HANDICAPS
Need Sisalation®4so Insulation
When it’s so darned hot that your office is an
oven, your factory a furnace, your staff slows down.
That’s bad. Bad for production and bad for
profits. What to do? Insulate with SISALATION
heat-reflecting aluminium foil insulation.
Inexpensive Sisalation makes summers 15 degrees
cooler and slashes winter fuel bills up to 40%
think what this means in terms of improved
productivity. Everyone works better because they’re
comfortable and happy.
When insulating new or existing offices and fac-
tories, build-in the extra comfort and added weather
protection of Sisalation 450. As an added benefit, when
left exposed as a ceiling surface, its high reflectivity
improves light distribution.
Sisalation 450 has qualities no other foil can match:
it’s guaranteed fire-resistant for life and is double-
reinforced for added strength.
A proved method of insulation, Sisalation 450 is
used extensively in factories, schools, warehouses,
and in cold stores operating at sub-zero temperatures.
Before you spend a cent on insulation in your factory
get the straight facts about SISALATION 450.

Getting over
the first
hurdle
AUSTRALIA has acquired its first
indoor riding school. The man respon-
sible is Franz Mairinger, chief instruc-
tor of the Equestrian Federation of
Australia, who put Australia on the
equestrian map at the Rome Olympics
in 1960 and is a former instructor of
Vienna’s Spanish Riding School.
When I talked to Franz Mairinger
at Bowral, 80 miles south of Sydney,
he was shovelling horse manure. “Of
course, in Europe I would have a groom
and stableboy to help me, but here,”
he shrugged, “I am grateful to be able
to work with horses and for the chance
we have now of starting our indoor
school.”
He pointed over the paddocks to the
big corrugated-iron shed. “It’s a modest
beginning, and we still have no stables,
yet we will manage,” he added.
Mairinger said all types of show rid-
ing, dressage, jumping, and three-day
events, from elementary to grand prix
standard, would be taught at the school.
He showed me his two horses, Tulla-
more, a six-year-old gelding, and
Mountaineer, an ex-racehorse, both of
which he has been training for three
months. He said he tried to work the
horses five hours a day. “This must go
on constantly for many months, two
years in fact, before they are trained.
But I have no time, I have just been
judging at the Melbourne Show and
for two weeks they have had no train-
ing. This is bad.
“Horses are more difficult to train
than riders,” he added. “The Eques-
trian Federation needs more money
badly. This modest shed cost $20,000.
Australia should do as Germany does.
At every event concerned with horses,
such as horse-racing, shows, etc., a
couple of cents is added to the
entrance price. This way Germany
has more than 100 riding schools,
German riders are world famous, Ger-
man horses are exported all over the
world, and riders from many countries

Mairinger said.
Mairinger himself is one of the few
men in the world who can train to
grand prix standard the three main
events, dressage, show jumping, and
three-day events.
Mairinger came to Australia in 1950
with no money, little English, but great
hope for the future because a pupil,
who had been here, told him Australians
were rather like Austrians and loved
horses. Mairinger had been with the
Spanish Riding School in Vienna since
1940 and had been an instructor since
1942. Prior to that he learnt to ride
as a conscript with the Austrian Army.
After World War 11, he, his wife,
and two children lost everything. As
things grew more depressing in Vienna,
he saved to get the fare to Australia,
mainly by giving riding lessons to rich
foreigners in Switzerland.
After working at several jobs in
Australia, including lumping wool in
an Adelaide store, where he nearly lost
his thumb on a bale hook, Franz
Mairinger went to work for Mr. A. J.
Higgins in his upholstery factory. Mr.
Higgins also had a stable of thorough-
bred horses and the Austrian riding
master was soon not only training
horses but taking prizes in the riding-
events at the Adelaide Show. Again
Mr. Higgins came to the rescue and
lent him the money to bring out his
wife, son, and daughter.
In 1954 the Equestrian Federation of
Australia, which had been formed by
the late Sam Hordern several years
previously, offered him the job of train-
ing the Olympic team Australia’s
first effort in the equestrian events.
At Stockholm in 1956 Australia
came fourth out of 18 nations and the
enthusiasm for Olympic-style riding
began to spread through South Aus-
tralia as well as Victoria and N.S.W.,
where three-day riding events were
soon held annually.
In 1957 Sam Hordern, president of
the EFA, gave the association 40 acres
of his Retford Park estate at Bowral,
and the association asked Franz Mai-
ringer to become the first permanent
instructor.
Mairinger said the happiest moment
of his life in Australia was the triumph
of the Australian Olympic team in
Rome when Laurie Morgan won the
individual Gold Medal, Neil Levis the
individual Silver Medal, and Levis and
Bill Roycroft the team Gold Medal.
“I felt I had begun to repay my
new country for taking us in,” he said.
“I’ve never been kissed by so many
Aussies as I was then. And, what’s
more, Colonel Hans Handler, the direc-
tor of the Spanish Riding School in
Vienna, offered me the job of chief
instructor. I was sorely tempted, but
by this time I was happy in Australia,
my children were Australians.
“And now I have Australian grand-
children, so I have put my roots down
deep in this country. Even though I
would make many times the money in
Europe, here I will stay.”
SHEILA PATRICK


MICHAEL BAUME WRITES OK
THE
ECONOMY
Not getting a
share as a
matter of policy
IF YOU OWN a life-assurance policy
you are being robbed. The simple fact is
that when your policy matures (one way
or another) you get back only a propor-
tion of what is really due to you. You
are entitled to more and you ought to
be getting more, particularly if you
belong to a “mutual” society, which is
supposed to be using your premiums
entirely for your benefit.
When assurance companies collect
your cash, they buy things with it, like
bonds, buildings (they own most of
downtown Sydney), shares or deben-
tures, or else they lend it out. What you
get in bonuses is the income from these
investments. You do not get the capital
appreciation, the increased market
value of them. Policyholders of the life-
assurance companies will not get one
farthing of the recent rise in BHP from
below $5 to more than $l5, for example,
although life offices would be the
biggest shareholders in BHP. All that
policyholders will eventually get will
be the increased income that the market
now hopes BHP will pay once its oil
wells are producing in several years’
time. But by then many of the holders
of policies will have died and many
policies will have matured. So the
benefits that are due to them now will
in fact go to future policyholders in-
stead. The amount of money involved
runs into many millions of dollars.
This has only become a serious prob-
lem since the war. Before then, insur-
ance companies hardly held any shares
and owned only a modest number of
buildings. They simply have failed to
face up to the change in policy they
ought to have made when they changed
their investment habits. Like the dis-
gracefully uninformative balance sheets
they issue, their policy on valuing assets
is years behind the times.
Look, for example, at the AMP
Society’s accounts. The AMP holds
almost $2OO million worth of shares at
book value and earns about 5.4 per-
cent on them. At the same time it holds
about $156 million of company deben-
tures and notes and receives 6J per-
cent on them. Now why should it
invest in shares that return so much
less a year than debentures and notes?
The answer is that, eventually, the
AMP’s investment advisers expect the
income from these shares to increase
to more than make up this gap; that
is the whole principle behind buying
shares. (And judging by the rates assur-
ance offices get on other investments,
they expect shares to do a lot better
than 6£ percent in the long run; the
rates of interest they charge on loans
for rural, housing, and “other” pur-
poses range from 6J percent to 81-
percent, according to the latest official
statistics.) In other words, by buying
shares, the AMP Society is sacrificing
income now in the hope of getting
higher income some time in the future.
This is grossly unfair to present
policyholders; it means that future
policyholders, are to get the benefits
from the sacrifices made by present
ones. But there is a way around this.
For “future expectations” about the
likely increase in income of shares is
reflected in their current market price;
so, if the assurance company’s holdings
of shares increase in value, this indi-
cates that the stockmarket has greater
hopes for those shares. The simple
answer, then, to the problem of how
to give present policyholders what they
are entitled to is to add the increase
in market values of shares to the sup-
plies available for distribution to policy-
holders each year.
In other words, the assets should be
revalued yearly and current policy-
holders should get any rises in values.
The same goes for buildings; the $4OO
million of buildings owned by Aus-
tralian life offices are probably worth
far more than that on the market; the
land on which many of them stand is
worth more than the book value of the
land plus buildings.
All this is not just a journalist’s
fancy; Professor Grant, of the Univer-
sity of Tasmania’s Department of
Applied Economics, pointed to this
serious problem of valuing assurance
company assets earlier this month when
addressing the 1967 convention of the
Institute of Actuaries of Australia and
New Zealand. He noted that one of
the distinctive trends in life-assurance
company activity in recent years has
been for a diminishing proportion of
their funds to be invested in official
securities, which are repayable at a
specified price at a specified time, and
for • an increasing proportion to be
spent on properties and shares, the
values of which can change often
significantly.
Life offices in Australia hold more
than $5OO million worth of ordinary
shares. Using a conservative method of
valuation, Professor Grant suggests that
the value of life-office ordinary share
investments are worth at least 20 per-
cent more than their book value. Most
observers would claim that the differ-
ence between the book value and the
market value of the ordinary shares
would be much greater. “The general
practice of the life offices has been to
record ordinary shares at or under cost
price, with the proviso in some cases
that shares received by way of bonus
issues are entered at face value,” he
says.
But not only this, the life offices also
have an “investment and contingencies
reserve” available for writing down
even further the values of their invest-
ments. Professor Grant recognises the
problems involved in using market
values as the basis of valuation of
shares, firstly because some shares held
by life offices will not be listed and
therefore will have no market value,
and secondly that there can be some
dispute over the relevance of a market
price to a holding of half a million
shares or so if that price can be
changed by the purchase or sale on
the market of a few thousand shares.
But he asks: “If ordinary shares are
recorded at or under cost and if the
long-run trend in share prices is up-
ward, when, if ever, will the unrealised
capital gains be recognised? If it is
argued that unrealised capital gains
should never be brought into account,
the interests of the present and future
generations of policyholders might be
better served by the life offices invest-
ing in assets in which the possibility
of capital gain is small and the current
return commensurably higher. If the
life offices are going to continue to
invest heavily in ordinary shares, their
policyholders have the right to insist
on a more equitable valuation of such
assets.” And so say all of us.
There is a solution to all this, and
a sensible one at that. It is to follow
the system used by the National
Association of Insurance Commission-
ers of the U.S.A. This is that ordinary
shares should be valued at their market
price at the end of the year, but in
order to avoid the consequences of big
swings in policyholders’ returns, one
percent of the value of the sharehold-
ings should be skimmed off into a
valuation reserve (but only up to a
level where the reserve equals one-
third of the book value of these securi-
ties). In this way, realised capital gains
are credited to the reserve and capital
losses are charged against it. This
means that movements in share prices
will be reflected in the balance sheet
(and therefore the bonuses) of assur-
ance companies, but their impact will
be cushioned by the minimum reserve
requirements.
In this way, policyholders stand a
better chance of getting what they are
entitled to, without being subjected to
very violent ups and downs as the stock-
market moves. We ought to do it here.

Miraculous recovery
A SYDNEY DOCTOR, exasperated
beyond measure, put the following
advertisement in a house journal: “For
sale: 1966 model car. Reasons for
cheap sale, 37,000 miles: in the last
eight weeks oil pump relief stuck, parts
unobtainable, new pump ($80); Tor-
ringtGn race thrust washer collapsed,
damaging transmission ($450); also
heater leaked, automatic choke ‘re-
paired’; car now does eight miles per
gallon; electrical system gives much
trouble.”
Having disposed of the car, faults
and all, a few weeks later he recog-
nised it in a second-hand-car salesyard
tagged “immaculate condition.”
A long look
THE MOST POSITIVE reaction to
the launching of John Barry cigarettes
on the Australian market last June was
a letter to the paper from someone
pointing out firmly that he didn’t intend
to buy cigarettes named after someone
who had fought against “us” in the
American War of Independence.
The writer had the advantage over
most Australians; he at least knew who
John Barry was. However, Rothmans
intend to press on with their campaign
to furnish Australia with second-hand
heroes. Another American, Paul Revere,
is already carrying the message in Vic-
toria and will soon come galloping into
New South Wales.
No Australian hero has managed to
get on a cigarette packet yet. According
to the company, “research into an
appropriate Australian is being done.”
Apparently, Ned Kelly was discarded
as being more fit for rum than cigar-
ettes.
Groovy
SYDNEY ARTIST Lindsay Bourke is
feeling pretty groovy. Apart from
recent breakthroughs he has the deli-
cious anticipation of playing his Qosmic
music on the Sydney Town Hall organ
at a concert on November 26. At the
mention of this, Bourke drops down
into the grass, looks up shyly through
his long hair, and beams at the sky and
the birds and the trees around him; he
had chosen Hyde Park for the inter-
view because a group of palms had
taken his fancy.
Bourke is primarily a painter, who
graduated from East Sydney Tech-
nical College last year with a consider-
able number of prizes to his credit.
“I am interested in realism, surrealism
in fact, all the isms,” he said.
In the past few months he has been
devoting more time to writing poetry
and to composing music, which he
began by making graph notations on
squared paper. He has since gradu-
ated to drawing in his own lines and
making the notations in green ink.
He hopes to link these three art
forms at the concert, called the Way-
side Chapel Happening, the brainchild
of the Rev. Ted Noffs. Bourke’s beam
becomes wider at the thought of color
slides of his paintings flashing on to
the organ pipes while he is going
hammer and tongs at the music and
someone else is reciting his poetry.
In the future, when he has some
money, he is grooving on the idea of
designing a piano with a color range
which will emit shooting color lights
when notes are pressed. This, he says,
will take some money.
Backstage
WE ENERGETICALLY mounted
narrow flights of stairs, passed a grey
sentinel cat perched halfway up, and
invaded a spick-and-span practice room
for the Australian Ballet Company. In
the mirror that ran the length of one
wall, figures in enviable trim in black
and white could be seen whirling about
in the muggy heat, looking under-
standably sweaty, determined but ex-
hausted, going through complicated
movements to a Tchaikovsky score in
the first part of “Ballet Imperial,” while
a pretty American girl clapped her
hands and said things like, “Janet, you’re
not turning enough” and “Monique,
don’t just stand waiting.” “Luckily it’s
only one of 20,” the ballerina Janet
Karin said as, perspiring like a stoker,
she rested her pretty form on a bench
after a complex solo, referring to a
particular painful toe. We couldn’t see
the other ten.
At the dusty old Tivoli, not far away,
the ballet has now opened its season
with “La Fille Mai Gardee.” In the
cramped room she shared with three
others, joint artistic director Peggy Van
Praagh told us about the peculiar prob-
lems of this ballet, including a horse,
which had misbehaved in the wings the
day before, and one particularly hard
maypole scene in which 16 members
of the cast had to take hold of ribbons;
one dancer out of step could have had
everyone helplessly entangled. As if
that weren’t enough to cope with, the
dancers had to carry stooks of hay at
one point, and at rehearsal the stooks
had fallen to pieces. Luckily, Miss Van
Praagh is a stoic and an optimist.
What with dancing with stooks and
sickles, the dancers were obviously
strained, although the pale and charm-
ing Kathleen Geldard, a star of the
ballet, seemed very relaxed. They were,
Miss Van Praagh told us, together with
the Festival Ballet in Britain, probably
the hardest worked corps in the world.
(“We’re not supposed to drink, but by
six o’clock we’re all saying, where’s the
whisky bottle?”) After a five-and-a-half-
month world tour which involved
playing in grim heat and dirt in
Jamaica and some sickness among the
cast, they had only had a two-week
break before two solid months of re-
hearsal followed by the present eight-
week season (the Bolshoi, by con-
trast, had months off each year). They
rehearsed all day from nine o’clock
allowing for a fairly ample lunch-break,
they were at it six hours solid a day.
How long did dancers last under these
conditions? “Five years as a rule. Then,
if they aren’t stars . . .” She shrugged.
“It’s just too hard, too dull to have
to wait.” Looking at the tired faces
and the rivers of sweat, the sore feet
and the tense jokes around the prac-
tice room an hour later, we could well
believe it.

AS I SEE IT
We don't know
the ABC of
trade with Japan
By ALAN REID
IF THE VISIT of Japanese Prime
Minister Sato achieves nothing else, it
should encourage the study of oriental
languages in Australia.
As Prime Minister Sato, relaxed,
poised, impeccably groomed in a suit
which he diplomatically pointed out
was tailored from an Australian-manu-
factured textile, and gifted with an
easy infectious smile, has emphasised
throughout his present visit Japan is
now Australia’s largest customer. It is
going to be larger. Whereas it now
draws about 50 percent of the iron ore
and coal needs of its expanding steel
industry from Australia, it is going to
step this up to 66-2/3 percent in the
not-distant future. And its other needs,
which Australia can fill, are expanding
under the stimulant of the highest
national income growth rate in the
world.
It is a truism of commerce and indus-
try that you sell more if you can speak
your customer’s language. Because by
and large our trade has been tradition-
ally orientated to the United Kingdom,
the truism has had a technical rather
than a broader linguistic meaning for
Australia. Our need was for salesmen
who could talk the same technical
language as the buyer. But now the
position has changed. Now, the need is
for salesmen who can talk the same
actual language as the buyer.
I think that Prime Minister Harold
Holt had the same feeling of inade-
quacy as I had during the Press con-
ference held by Mr. Sato at the Hotel
Canberra last week. Present were some
25 Japanese journalists who were trav-
elling with Mr. Sato on his South-East
Asian mission.
From conversations with them and
from their reactions as Mr. Sato’s
Japanese words were rendered into
English by a Japanese official, it was
obvious that a high proportion of them
were able to understand what Mr. Sato
was saying in both languages. I doubt
if there was a single one of my col-
leagues who could identify even a soli-
tary word used by Mr. Sato. I know I
could not.
The same feeling of shortcoming
seemed to operate with Holt. With
considerable humility he told Mr. Sato
at the parliamentary luncheon: “One
of our great problems in making effec-
tive contact with you is our language.
I have been somewhat humbled to find
that you can communicate with me in
my language certainly to a very much
greater degree than I could ever hope
to communicate with you in yours.”
But with a note of optimism and
one which it is to be hoped will spill
over into official encouragement of
more intensive teaching of oriental
languages in Australian educational
institutions Holt added: “But in-
creasingly Japanese is being learned at
Australian schools and universities, and
I hope this process will continue.”
The best yardstick to measure Aus-
tralia’s capacity to communicate with
our largest customer in their own
language is probably the External
Affairs Department. Not merely profess-
ing the merit of acquiring languages
which are of primary concern to Aus-
tralia, the Department holds out the
inducement of financial gain to its
officers who become proficient in Asian
languages, and pays them an allowance
for each one.
So far, the number of officials form-
ally qualified is very small. In reply
to a question from Opposition Leader
Gough Whitlam in the House of Repre-
sentatives on May 11 this year, Exter-
nal Affairs Minister Paul Hasluck
revealed the fewness of those formally
qualified. Hasluck said that the number
of officers of the External Affairs
Department who, since 1961, had quali-
fied at language examinations prescribed
by the Public Service Board still serv-
ing with the Department on March 14,
1967, were: Chinese (2), Japanese (5),
Indonesian (6), and Thai (1).
If that is the position in the External
Affairs Department, the position pro-
portionately in the general Australian
community cannot be much better.
On the official level where, of
necessity, deals and agreements must be
registered in two. languages this situa-
tion must produce a certain amount of
irritation on the part of the country
with which Australia is doing or seek-
ing to do business.
Traces of this irritation came through
the urbanity of Mr. Sato at his Press
conference when he was reviewing the
stage reached in the Australian-Japanese
negotiations on a double taxation
agreement. Said Mr. Sato: “This ques-
tion of double taxation is a long stand-
ing issue or problem between our two
Governments. It goes back as far as
the time when Prime Minister Ikeda
was in charge four or five years ago.
As far as you are concerned, it is
a great political problem and as one
who is engaged in the political
world I fully understand some of
the difficulties that might exist. How-
ever, I am informed that Australia will
shortly terminate its discussions on this
matter with the United Kingdom and
that it would be ready to take up this
problem after that. So I have high
expectations that this matter would be
taken up some time early next year.”
Undoubtedly, technical difficulties
and the fact that Australia has had a
double taxation agreement with the
United Kingdom which had to be
considered in conjunction with the
proposed Japanese agreement helped to
hold things up. But as I have been
hearing it for years one of the diffi-
culties was that Australia was also short
of the qualified personnel to carry on
the negotiations on a continuous basis.
It would not surprise me if the short-
age was double-sided—of qualified
officials who could be spared for long
periods, and who were also fluent in
the Japanese language.
Even with the barrier of language,
Mr. Sato contrived to lay several things
on the line in a remarkably smooth
performance at his Press conference.
He made it quite clear that Japan, as
Australia’s best customer, expected
reasonable treatment. The incident at
Port Hedland, in Western Australia,
where the Trades and Labor Council
wanted the withdrawal of working
permits of 60 Japanese on the dredge
engaged in improving the port, has
so far appeared very minor in Aus-
tralian eyes. It has attracted only cur-
sory attention.
Mr. Sato was quite outspoken. “This
question of being able to build a harbor
or port facilities is an important one,”
he said. “Japan’s industry is greatly
dependent on Australia. The building
of port facilities is a contributing factor
to overall expansion of trade between
our two countries. I have spoken on
this matter to both the Government and
the Leaders of the Opposition to
achieve an early solution of the matter.
I trust that the unions in this country
will understand this problem in the
light of what I have said. I point out
(to the unions) that the building of
harbors and port facilities facilitates
the flow of trade between our two
countries and creates new jobs for
(Australian) workers in the building
of port facilities.”
Mr. Sato’s approach and talks, par-
ticularly with Labor’s parliamentary
leaders, could secure a settlement of
the Port Hedland dispute which is
undoubtedly seen by him as com-
paratively major in principle.
But the long-term value in his visit
could be an intensification of interest
in Australia in the study of oriental
languages. With Japan on the verge of
becoming the third-largest economy in
the world and the Australian-Japanese
economies becoming increasingly inter-
woven, the need for such intensification
is becoming daily more urgent.


AUSTRALIA
They came, saw —and asked
for more civil aid
THEY MAY HAVE seemed just
another couple of these foreign VIPs
who seem to be flying in each week.
But they were rather different. They
meant business.
Indonesia’s Finance Minister Dr.
Ceda was here asking for help. Indo-
nesian officials are disappointed at the
hesitancy of Australian businessmen in
investing money there. With a new
liberal open-door policy, businessmen
from Holland, the U.S., Britain, Italy,
and, of course, Japan have flocked into
the virgin market. Their investments
as well as being vital to Indonesia are
likely to be profitable.
Dr. Ceda also wanted to try to get
Australia to do more as a member of
the Tokyo Club of nations which is
underwriting Indonesia’s recovery
program. He was able to point out
that Australia’s contribution this year
has been very small—ss million. It
is less than several West European
countries with few direct interests in
South-East Asia and looks terrible
beside Japan’s $65 million contribu-
tion. The Asian Development Bank
subscription by Japan was $2OO million
and Australia agreed to contribute $B5
million. On that basis, with the Jap-
anese likely to put $lOO million toward
Indonesian development next year,
Australia’s share would be of the order
of $4O million.
And, of course, just as the Indo-
nesian Finance Minister left, the Jap-
anese Prime Minister, Mr. Sato, arrived.
It was a dazzling display of purposeful
diplomacy. He backed the Australian
Government’s policies in Vietnam to
the hilt. A halt to the bombing of the
Dr. Ceda and Acting Treasurer Bury.
North would be unwise without any
sign of reciprocation. Those like Aus-
tralia who were involved militarily
were not there for aggressive purposes,
but to create conditions under which
a peaceful settlement was possible.
Both Japan and Australia were dedi-
cated to “the cause of peace and the
defence of freedom.” Japan, he
hastened to add, was prevented from
being involved militarily by its con-
stitution —an implicit statement that
otherwise Japan might be making its
military contribution to the Allied
effort.
He supported fully the Australian
Government’s policy of Asian involve-
ment. But he made it clear Japan
expected Australia to come through
with more civil aid. “Japan is going
to contribute $lOO million to the Agri-
cultural Development Fund, but this
contribution is conditional on other
countries making a matching sum. I
have asked the Australian Government
to co-operate with us in this, and I am
hopeful that you will play a role in
Indonesia.”
The Japanese are confident that
Australia will participate in the Agri-
cultural Fund. Especially as they note
that Australian leaders—notably Mr.
Hasluck and Mr. McEwen —have on
numerous occasions said that economic
aid should be oriented more directly
toward agriculture. On the basis of
the Bank subscription, Australia’s con-
tribution to the Agricultural Fund
would be $42.5 million, spread over
five years.
Treasury officials in Canberra are
thoroughly apprehensive about the
Prime Ministers Sato and Holt.
week’s proceedings. Most of them are
against aid anyway (it’s something
some of them like even less than sub-
sidies to dairyfarmers and high tariffs),
but they don’t think the country can
afford this sort of involvement in Asia.
“We’re just starting to digest the basic
subscription to the Asian Development
Bank,” said one last week.
But if Mr. Holt is to give substance
to his repeatedly professed concern to
involve Australia fully in collective
efforts to defend and develop the
peoples of South-East Asia, he will have
to assert himself over the keepers of
the public purse.
Vietnam Task Force
Phase 2
THE AUSTRALIAN TASK Force in
Vietnam has completed the first phase
of its strategy for the province for which
it is responsible. In the remarkably
short time of 18 months, the 4000-
man force has transformed the security
situation. Before they came at least
half the hamlets were under solid
Communist administration, and Gov-
ernment officials could not travel with
safety anywhere outside the provincial
capital of Baria. Several fiercely anti-
Communist communities were beseiged,
constantly threatened with being over-
run and massacred. The area was a
■ major thoroughfare for Communist
units being transferred from the Delta
to Corps Zones 2 and 3. It was an
integral part of the plan to isolate
Saigon by surrounding it with hostile
outposts. A population of 120,000 pro-
vided the Viet Cong with a constant
source of recruits, and its rice, fish, and
salt industries with supplies. One of the
Viet Cong’s three mainforce divisions,
a local battalion and a guerilla force
of 2000 were based in the province.
The change wrought in 18 months is
dramatic. Government officials are now
able to operate throughout the popu-
lated areas with little danger from the
Viet Cong. The mainforce division has
been forced well away from the vil-
lages of the south-west of the province
out into the Mao Tao mountains and
into dispersed groups. Special Air
Squadron groups have continuously
harassed them there, acting as guerillas
in powerful hit-and-run ambushes. The
effect of this, and also the many sweep
operations conducted by the two bat-
talions there, has been to force the
Communists on to the defensive. One
regiment has been so knocked around


that it has been withdrawn into Zone
D, near the Cambodian border, for rest
and refit.
Within the umbrella of security pro-
vided by the Task Force, Vietnamese
officials and police have been able to
resume operations. Schools have been
reopened. In this new security context
the guerilla force has begun to wither.
Many have become inactive: others
are no longer able to live in their vil-
lages. A system of checkpoints and a
ten mile fence, plus checks on ox-
carts and fishing boats, severely hinder
the movement of Communist supplies
and personnel.
New recruitment by the Viet Cong
is negligible and the defection rate
high. Very little of this year’s rice har-
vest got out to the Communists, who
are being forced now to grow their
own out in the jungle rather than take
it from the people. Out there it can be
destroyed by defoliation. It was this
sort of achievement which prompted
Task Force commander Stuart Graham
to say last week that the Communists
are “virtually finished” in Phuoc Tuy.
That is not to say that Australian
troops could pack up and go home
without the situation reverting to what
it was before, he would be quick to
agree. The philosophy of the Aus-
talian effort is to fight a war of attri-
tion against the Communists. Major
search-and-destroy operations are gen-
erally rejected as very costly in man-
power and casualties, and unproductive,
given the Communist troops’ capacity
for dispersion and evasion. Smaller
sweep operations, harassment, systematic
searches for guerillas and supplies are
the main techniques used. Their pur-
pose: to neutralise rather than destroy.
The second phase will be a protracted
one to eliminate what remains of VC
influence in the province. For the pres-
ent, military security could easily
crumble unless deepened. Consolidation
is to be the theme-word now. This will
involve increased civic action work to
consolidate the support of the popula-
tion, jungle clearance to make ambushes
and terrorism more difficult, many more
U.S. General Westmoreland visits Gra-
ham (r.) and the Australians at Nui Dat
checkpoints and searches to choke off
the movements of supplies to the Com-
munists in the jungle and pick up VC
guerillas and officials, and a heightened
effort to develop the Vietnamese ad-
ministration and militia units.
The two battalions will continue to
be fully employed in deterring and
reducing the remains of the VC sth
Division for some time to come. The
addition of further troops might enable
the Australian area of responsibility to
be enlarged somewhat, but the base
camp at Nui Dat is likely to remain,
and many more tents are going to rot
and be renewed beneath the rubber trees
before Australian troops move out.
In the field... fresh-food delivery
Drought
Another blow to balance of payments
THE DROUGHT that now spreads, in
pockets, right around Australia could
probably have as much overall impact
on the economy as the ruinous N.S.W.-
Queensland drought that broke early
in 1966. Already, it has knocked the
wheat crop back to the levels of
drought-stricken 1965-66; the only
reason it is not killing off cattle and
sheep in many areas is that there are
very few left to kill off; and it is
already causing stock run-downs and
crop failures in new drought areas in
many parts of Australia that did well
during the last drought. Estimates
of farm incomes are down 9 percent
and may fall lower unless there are
substantial rains soon.
Even secondary industry is feeling
the direct impact of drought, with
bulk electric power supplies to Tas-
manian users being cut 25 percent for
at least nine months (bringing many
falls in industrial production) while
some big new natural resources
developments that were about to come
on-stream have had their power
supplies “deferred.”
Last week the South Australian
Parliament passed a Drought Relief
Assistance Bill, and the Government
asked Mr. Holt for an urgently needed
$6 million for drought relief. The
Victorian Government wants Com-
| monwealth drought finance, too.
I Already N.S.W. and Queensland are
' to receive $3.9 million in 1967-68 in
1 interest-free loans for drought relief,
following last year’s $7.2 million and
the previous year’s $l2 million. The
worsening drought situation in these
two States could prompt them to ask
i for more.
Last week’s rain in some areas was
I not enough to prevent a likely $3OO
I million drop in the Australian wheat
[ crop, which will probably total only
[ 260 million bushels (about the same
I as in the 1965-66 drought year) corn-
pared with a record 467 million
bushels in 1966-67.
This is still a big harvest; there
have been only three harvests bigger
than 260 million bushels in the nation’s
history. But it is a major blow in
terms of the acreage sown to wheat —
and to hopes of keeping rural incomes
up this year to help the recovery from
the 1965-66 drought, the after-effects
of which are still widely felt.
The failure of the spring rains was
so complete and general that the
damage is done. A record 21 million
acres was sown under average-to-good
winter conditions but follow-up growing
rains just didn’t turn up, especially in
N.S.W. A confidently expected N.S.W.
crop of 210 million bushels has withered
into a crop which may be as low as 60
million and is unlikely to be higher than
80 million. In the new wheat areas
farthest west crops are a complete
failure, elsewhere they are stunted and
likely to yield only 15 or 20 grains per
head to the 30 normally produced.
Victoria, earlier thought to get 60
million bushels, is likely, due to failures
in the Wimmera and Mallee, to pro-
duce a bit over 30 million. South
Australia’s adjoining wheat areas are
a complete write-off. But the Eyre
and York Peninsulas of South Aus-
tralia are having an average season,
which should bring in about 22 million
bushels for the State. Western Australia
is expected to get in about 90 million
bushels. This is less than the 110
million predicted at the time of sow-
ing, and less than last year’s 105 million,
but for the State as a whole it is a
good crop.
All this is a blow to the balance of
payments, for agricultural production
had been expected to help pay for the
increasing level of imports likely this
year as Government - encouraged
economic expansion in the private
sector continues. And wheat was to


have been the growth factor in rural
exports.
There is some carryover from last
year’s drought. The western division of
N.S.W., the western half of Queens-
land, and the Murray-Mallee district
of S.A. are getting it again. These areas
have had virtually no useful rain in
more than three years —or 40 months, to
be precise. They got just enough in
autumn this year for many people to
judge the drought of 1964-65 and
1965-66 “broken” at last.
In the eastern halves of Queensland
and N.S.W. it was broken, and there
have been adequate follow-up rains.
But in the more sparsely populated
western halves there wasn’t, and
drought has arrived again. Of course
both areas are seriously understocked,
anyway, as a result of dry seasons in
1965 and 1966, so at least the small
amount of feed growing on from the
light winter rains will last longer.
Queensland and the far north of
N.S.W. expect to get most of their rain
in summer, so the prospects there may
get better as the weeks pass.
The rich western district of Victoria
is worse hit, and this is the area which
has been providing the Melbourne
papers with stories about sheep selling
for less than rabbits. Usually an area
of very reliable rainfall, it is reckoned
to have had the driest spell since 1914;
some say the worst on record. No hay
was cut this winter, and feed has been
bought in for months now. Lambing
was 25 percent down, and the wool clip
is expected to be light. And here, as
opposed to Queensland and the north
of N.S.W., prospects get worse as the
weeks go by, since the summer is the
dry season in the south. The one sav-
ing grace is improved pastures, which
are pretty general here. Being peren-
nial, they will respond to rain when-
ever it comes.
This is more than can be said for
the Wimmera and Mallee areas, whose
annual grasses have not been germin-
ated and won’t until next winter what-
ever rains fall between now and then,
The Murray-Mallee areas of South Aus-
tralia are similarly afflicted, and in
both sheep are being sold off apace as
their condition deteriorates. At least
there is a market. The Commonwealth
Railways are doing plenty of business
freighting them across the Nullarbor to
Western Australia. Over there pastures
were in superb condition until August,
when spring rains failed to come in full
strength, but they are still in average
condition, and stock is not threatened",
The Tasmanian problem is that, des-
pite recent rains, the catchment areas
had only received about 72 percent of
their normal intake in the past three
months, and this had followed a long
“dry,” when rainfall was only 60 per-
cent of average (at the time of the
Hobart fires) and had fallen to barely
40 percent by May. So the Hydro Elec-
trie Commission’s storages have fallen
to 20 percent of the norm, and Tas-
mania has introduced daylight saving to
cut down electricity usage.
Commonwealth-States
The end of "divide and conquer"
THIS TIME, the fury of the States
against the Commonwealth’s control of
the purse strings really could result
in some changes in a financial relation-
ship that began when the Common-
wealth took over all income tax raising
rights during the war and did not give
them back. This is now claimed to be
“destroying the sovereignty of the
States” and making a “mockery of the
Federal system.”
• Last week, in response to nation-
wide complaints from Liberal leaders,
T the Prime Minister announced he
would meet the top Liberals of the six
States to discuss an overhaul of Com-
monwealth-State financial relations,
probably early next year.
This followed a day after N.S.W.
Labor Opposition Leader J. B. Ren-
shaw announced a meeting of State
Labor Parliamentary Party leaders and
the top Federal men, Mr. Whitlam and
Senator Murphy, to discuss “specific
action to break the financial impasse”
between the Commonwealth and the
States. And he promised to call a
constitutional convention to review the
whole range of Commonwealth-State
relations if he were returned to office.
Australia-wide indications of Labor
support for Mr. Renshaw’s idea,
“borrowed” from last month's deci-
sion by the Federal Council of the
Liberal Party to ask Mr. Holt to call a
constitutional convention on the sub-
ject, will have no immediate signi-
ficance, as there are only two Labor
leaders, the Premiers of South Aus-
tralia and Tasmania, who attend the
Loan Council. But with the Labor
Party being traditionally a “centralist”
one, there could be long-term signi-
ficance if this policy is changed—and
if the present leadership is still in
command if and when Labor wins
control of the Loan Council.
Mr. Holt’s meeting with fellow
Liberal leaders, likely for early next
year, will be followed by February’s
interim Loan Council meeting, at
which there is some prospect that the
survey of Commonwealth-State financial
relations, promised by the Common-
wealth at last February’s meeting, will
at last take place.
But there is still a strongly held
official view in Canberra that there is
unlikely to be any real change in the
way the cake is cut up before the
present agreement expires in 1970. Its
approval in 1965 marked a major
defeat for the States, particularly
N.S.W. and Victoria which have suf-
fered financial difficulties as a result
of it.
It has always been easy for the
Commonwealth Government to keep
the six States in such a condition of
division at meetings of the Loan
Council that they have never been able
to form any united front against the
Commonwealth’s methods of doling
out taxation revenue and loan entitle-
ments.
For the formulas that apply to these
distributions differ between the States,
and those smaller or “developing” States
which do better per head than the
bigger “developed” ones are always
fearful of jepoardising that advantage if
the system were revised. Last year,
N.S.W. was allocated only $75 a head
out of the loan program, while Victoria
got $B5, Queensland $BB, South Austra-
lia $97, Western Australia $9B, and Tas-
mania got $154 per head. The dif-
ference between N.S.W. and Victoria
is a bit unreal in terms of the greater
area of N.S.W. that needs servicing.
The same sort of thing happens W'ith
the tax grants; last year N.S.W. and
Victoria got back about $63 a head,
but Queensland received $75, S.A. got
$B6, W.A. $lO2, and Tasmania $9O.
But now the States are all agreed on
one major point; they all want more
money from the Commonwealth.
Treasurer Mr. McMahon will find it
difficult to use the old “divide and sur-
vive” trick this time.
The States are certainly united in
complaining .about the way the Com-
monwealth has been giving itself so
much tax money that it has been able
to reduce its loan debt by more than
20 percent since 1950, while the States
have been given so little in relation to
the jobs to do and have had to borrow
so much that their debt has trebled over
this period.
And as N.S.W. Liberal Premier Askin
pointed out in his recent Budget speech,
Federal income tax receipts have in-
creased by 10 percent since 1959, but
tax reimbursements to the States have
risen by only percent, leaving a
sizable gap.
Because of the growing gap between
the cash they get from Commonwealth
and their needs, the States have all
been desperately looking for new ways
to raise money. Fares and charges
have gone up in most of them and
State taxes have been increased or new
ones added, like the W.A.-Victoria turn-
over-wages “stamp duty.”
And all this has been despite a siz-
able increase of between 11 and 13
percent in the cash allocated this year
to the States from Commonwealth
sources. This was remarkably generous
in an economic situation where the
Federal Government was trying to hold
back official spending in order to give
private enterprise a bit of a go.
In any event, there seems little pros-
pect of the States all agreeing to ask


for their taxing power to be returned
to them; it is far better to be able to
blame the Commonwealth for a lack of
funds than to have to increase taxes
yourself. And the demands of modern-
style economic policy mean that fiscal
powers must remain in the hands of
the body that 'is charged with the
management of the nation’s economy.
Even State politicians know that.
Margarine
Plain Jane
SINCE MARCH NEW table mar-
garines “in disguise” have eluded the
margarine quota system and turned the
margarine quota controversy, so heavily
advertised last year, into the Major
Non-Controversy of 1967.
The quota system places no limit
on the sale of margarine that is com-
posed of 90 percent animal fat and
labelled “cooking margarine.” So the
margarine manufacturers have launched
new products, containing 90 percent
animal fat, labelled it “cooking mar-
garine” and then taken heavy adver-
tising campaigns suggesting that the
new products are “table margarine in
all but name.” The earlier health
angle, that margarines made of poly-
unsaturated fats were better for you
than animal-fat butter, has been
dropped, naturally.
First in the field was Marrickville,
last year’s anti-quota campaigners, with
Eta “Super Spread.” This was fol-
lowed by Allied Mills’ “Jonquil.” Two
weeks ago Provincial Traders, a
Queensland company, came out with
“Kirrabel.” When advertising for
“Super Spread” proclaims, “Spread
the word that ‘spreads’ the word,”
The “new” margarines ... spreading a battle of words
“Kirrabel” has come out with, “The
law says it’s ‘Plain Jane’ cooking mar-
garine—but there’s no law says you
can’t spread it and love it,” and “You
wouldn’t use a great-tasting margarine
like this to cook with, would you?”
The quota for table margarine was
16,000 tons last year, the demand was
22,000 tons. The new products are
already selling about half as well as
conventional table margarine, which
they undercut by about 10c in price,
and about two-thirds as well as poly-
unsaturated margarine. The possi-
bility is that in making foolishness of
the quota system, so that it may have
to be dropped, these “great tasting”
margarines could reduce, even end, the
demand for “table,” including poly-
unsaturated, marge.
This is something the Australian oil-
seed industry must be watching with
wonder, now that, suddenly, the “con-
troversy” has been dropped—and them
with it? Or will the new products at
a certain stage in the marketing
pattern as suddenly become just a little
less “great tasting,” and the virtues of
polyunsaturated, non - animal - fat
margarine be rediscovered?
Unions
Fuel and fodder
THE SMALL Melbourne-based Fuel
and Fodder Workers’ Union has sub-
mitted a log of claims to the Victorian
Wages Board which could provide a
test case for hundreds of other unions
throughout Australia, and involve Aus-
tralian industry in extra costs of hun-
dreds of millions of dollars annually.
The Fuel and Fodder Workers are
covered by five separate awards from
five Wages Boards. Each Board has been
served with a comprehensive log of
claims by the secretary of the union, Mr.
Geoff McDonald, who recently re-
signed as an organiser for the Build-
ing Workers’ Industrial Union to take
up his new position.
The logs of claims include applica-
tions for improved wages, amenities,
and conditions, and most important
is a claim for equal pay for women
doing the same work as men. The
significant fact is that the case will be
fought on the grounds of work value,
grounds which are rarely exploited by
union advocates but which offer great
scope for the summoning of evidence
supporting union claims.
Assisted by the professional advice
of Mr. Ray O’Dea of the ANU, Mr.
McDonald has opened up a new and
highly promising field of industrial
advocacy by fighting his cases on work
value rather than on the profitability
of the industry or some other purely
economic ground. He is already pro-
ceeding with Wages Board work value
cases for tilelayers and rooftilers.
The latest case with the crucial work
value claim of equal pay for women
will open early in November before
Wages Board chairman Mr. Cullen. A
large number of professional, academic,
and industrial witnesses will be called.
Included among them will be repre-
sentatives of the YWCA and the
Women’s Temperance Union. Oppos-
ing them will be the Victorian Chamber
of Manufactures and the Bag and
Sack Merchants’ Association.
The union intends to conduct a
strike poll among its members at
the beginning of November to win
permission to conduct guerilla strikes
against employers if delaying tactics
are used during the hearing of the
case.
If the Fuel and Fodder Workers can
win equal pay for women, and there
are strong reasons for believing that
their comprehensive case will be hard
to answer, Wages Boards and other
industrial tribunals throughout Aus-
tralia can expect a flood of similar
applications from unions large and
small all wanting to argue their
claims on the grounds of work value,
and all calling on numbers of expert
witnesses.
The acceptance of equal pay by one
State Industrial Tribunal would be a
powerful precedent for others to fol-
low. Of similar importance will be
the pattern of argument followed by
McDonald and his list of expert
witnesses.
The Federal Arbitration Commission
has already affirmed the concept of
equal margins in the clothing trades,
and the president of the Commission
last June called for unions to try
their luck before it on the extension
of equal pay to the total wage.
However, the most important case
for women workers for some time to
come will be that fought between the
Fuel and Fodder Workers and the Bag
and Sack Merchants at the Victorian
Wages Board. The result could ulti-
mately determine the allocation of
perhaps $4OO million a year in wages.

JAPAN THE THIRD SUPER POWER?
IT IS FASHIONABLE in Australia
to imagine that if there is to be a
third super power, to go along with
Russia and America, it would be China.
According to the politics of the ob-
server, this thought can arouse either
dread or delight. But neither of the two
main considerations on which it seems
to be based nor both of them to-
gether necessarily establishes China
as a super power. One is its population.
The other is its nuclear strength.
In power terms size of population
does not settle anything much. For
example, Nigeria and Brazil have some-
thing of the same size population as
Britain; or, even more to the point,
India has a massive population of the
same order of magnitude as China’s,
almost beyond ordinary belief. But in
neither of these cases does size of
population have any relation to the
world power of the country concerned.
And so far as nuclear strength is con-
cerned, both Britain and France already
possess it, without laying credible
claims to being super powers.
The most likely candidate to future
super powerdom if there is to be
one may be Japan. This country of
100 million people has already pro-
duced the third biggest economy in the
world. It uses more computers than
any country except the United States.
It builds half the world’s ships. It pro-
duces more steel per head than Britain.
Its vehicle industry is now (somewhat
after it made the claim) third in the
world. It twice as large
a proportion of its gross national pro-
duct as Britain or the United States
and its national income grows, on
average, four times as fast. '
But, since its defeat in 1945, its
weight in world politics has been, until
very recently indeed, virtually nil. It is
this astonishing discrepancy between
economic and political weight that gives
importance to the Asian tours now being
undertaken by the Japanese Prime
Minister, Mr. Eisaku Sato, of which
his visit to Australia last week was a
part. Mr. Sato began in early Septem-
ber with a trip to Taiwan. He then
went to Burma, Malaysia, Singapore,
Thailand, and Laos. On his present trip
he is visiting Indonesia, Australia, New
Zealand, the Philippines, and South
Vietnam. To round it all off, he will
be in the United States in November.
No Japanese leader since the war—or
indeed ever —has undertaken a program
of international visits anything like
this. Modest though Mr. Sato’s stated
aims are, he is serving notice that, in
all respects but military strength, Japan
is now on the brink of becoming a
world power.
So far, internationally, successive
Japanese Governments have been
almost unnaturally careful to avoid
throwing their weight around. They
have been helped by the fortunate
accident that the Americans in 1947,
just before they began thinking of
Japan as a bastion against Commun-
ism, imposed on it a constitution
that renounced the country’s right to
maintain armed forces at all. This
astounding provision has much em-
barrassed Japanese Governments, and
their way round it a “national
police reserve” in 1950 that later be-
came a “safety corps” and is now
known as “self-defence” forces has
been pretty transparent. Yet even the
latest increase will leave the “selE
defence” forces only 250,000 strong.
A renewal of Japanese military aggres-
sion figures nowhere on any serious
Asian list.
In other ways many Japanese are still
curiously modest in their global im-
agination. Many of them still see them-
selves as “catching up” with the rest
of the world when in some develop-
ments they are already ahead of every-
body else and the fact is that the rest
of the world should be catching up
with them. There is still a mutual ig-
norance between the world and Japan.
Asian nations do not study Japanese
industrialisation with the interest that
one would have assumed it might have
aroused in them. Nor do European
competitors consider that they have
anything to learn from Japan, even
when Japan beats them at their own
game. European (and Australian) news-
paper coverage of Japan is, for example,
patchy at the best and often, apart from
sensations, very close to not existing.
And, although they live by exports,
many of the Japanese themselves are
still remarkably insular, looking in on
themselves, uninterested in “outsiders.”
As their economic power hurtles for-
ward, this must end. What are some of
the images the Japanese could have of
themselves as a world power?
JAPAN and ASIA
To what extent the Japanese really
see themselves as “Asians” is a matter
for dispute. There is no colonial left-
over in Japan. Her modernisation and
industrialisation were national affairs,
without any links of habit with a for-
mer European occupier. And now when
Japan looks at the other countries of
Asia it sees underdeveloped societies
and untaken-off economies that are
different from her own not in degree
but in kind. They are also different
in their “nationalism,” which is often
confused or contradictory, whereas the
confidence of Japanese self-identity is
one of the strongest in the world.
Until now, in relations with the rest
of Asia, Japan has been like a heavy
man who avoids breaking the ice simply
by not treading on it. The Japanese
have still to demonstrate that when
they talk of Asian economic co-opera-
tion they really mean something quite
different from what Asian “co-pros-
perity” turned out to mean in 1942. It
Mr. Sato arrives in Canberra, greets Japanese war brides
. ..lays a wreath at the Australian War Memorial
...confers with Prime Minister Holt
...dines in Sydney with Premier Askin
is true that it is a tribute to the good
sense of the Japanese that few Asians
have any fears of another outbreak of
militarism. Even in Communist China,
which suffered most from Japanese
militarism, there does not appear to be
that rooted suspicion that Poles openly,
and many other Europeans more or less
consciously, feel toward Germany. But
what does figufe vigorously among
Japan’s former colonial subjects in
South Korea is fear of Japanese
economic domination. The small coun-
tries of Asia badly want Japanese capi-
tal, but in the same breath they are
frightened of the results of getting it.
One can see why.
At bottom, Japan’s economic rela-
tions with the area seem likely to be
dominated by two internal trends in
the Japanese economy itself. Japan
derives more of its income every year
from its modern automated industries;
but these at present rely on sub-con-
tracting the more labor-using less-auto-
mated manufacturing of components to
much smaller Japanese firms, which
used to be able to pay lower wages
than the big concerns. Now these
smaller Japanese sub-contractors find it
increasingly difficult to get cheap labor;
and some big Japanese industrialists are
soon likely to suggest that more and
more of this work should be sub-con-
tracted to firms, probably pretty tightly
tied to the Japanese parent, in some of
these other South-East Asian countries
—though with obvious dangers of accu-
sations of economic colonialism.
The second development is that
South-East Asia tends to be an impor-
tant export market for Japan’s newer
industries rather than its old ones. In
the manufacture of some capital equip-
ment and other technological products,
including computers, Japan is still at
the semi-struggling initial stage; it
knows that the quality of these particu-
lar products is not yet high enough to
sell in the American market (exports to
America are products of the more
established industries, with cars as the
biggest newcomer). While Japan is
building up other capital equipment-
making industries to the stage where
they become fully competitive with
America’s and Germany’s, it would
like some infant export market for
them, possibly to be encouraged by
more generous credit terms than Japan
has granted hitherto. South-East Asia
is the obvious possible target.
JAPAN and RUSSIA
To a surprising extent, the Soviet
Union, Japan’s traditional rival, has
become something of a side issue. The
two countries have not yet reached a
peace treaty, essentially because the
Russians remain in possession of some
small islands off northern Japan,

acquired or occupied by them after
1945. The Japanese, whose Foreign
Minister was in Moscow a few months
ago, hope that this argument can be
solved in conjunction with plans,
already under way, for Japanese par-
ticipation in the development of Siberia.
Talks about some agreement short of
a full peace treaty are expected soon.
JAPAN and CHINA
On China, the Japanese have broadly
toed the American line. They have
traded with enthusiasm in recent
years but refused recognition. This
Nelson-eyed policy broke down in 1958,
and may have been endangered again
by Chinese irritation at Mr. Sato’s trip
last month to Taiwan. But one day,
and probably sooner than the Ameri-
cans do the same, the Japanese are
going to ask themselves seriously how
long one major Government in Asia
can pretend that another one does not
legitimately exist.
JAPAN and AMERICA
This will mean, essentially, a re-
assessment of Japan’s relationship not
with Peking and with Taipeh but with
Washington. Will Japan forever be con-
tent to remain the loyal ally of the
United States? Mr. Sato’s present
answer is yes: he recently called the
contentious mutual security pact with
the United States “the basis of Japan’s
prosperity,” saying that one could argue
in what form the security system would
continue after 1970, when either side
can end it, but that he was determined
to maintain the system itself. A major
irritant and it may be significant that
this is now the major public issue in
Japanese foreign policy remains the
American occupation of Okinawa and
the Ryukyu islands. The Americans not
only have a huge nuclear base in Okin-
awa: while recognising Japan’s residual
sovereignty they have refused to aban-
don the islands’ administration.
Between now-friendly nations, after
22 years of peace, this is a grotesque
and embarrassing position. For a Right-
wing Government it is a particularly
complex one. Mr. Sato wants to get
Okinawa back, but he does not want
to fall out with the Americans. He
accepts also the significance of the
American bases for Japan’s own security.
Yet he cannot simply accept, even if
the Americans would, what might seem
the natural solution: the return of
Okinawa to Japanese administration
with the continued existence of the
American nuclear base as part of the
deal. Japanese public opinion will riot
now stand for the introduction of
nuclear weapons on Japanese soil.
This raises the biggest question of
all. The Japanese may not universally
love the American alliance, but, given
the world’s traditional methods of
achieving security, they have no great
choice: without significant forces of
their own, they are not just allies but
dependants. How long will this
eminently profitable dependency
be acceptable? And if Japan once starts
to use its weight in earnest how much
of a super power will it become?

The Architects Revolution
Seidler ... onslaughts
The new Sydney
WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN, in the
past ten years, a violent tearing-up of
Australian cities, and recent plans indi-
cate further wholesale replanning with
large sectors redeveloped and an intro-
duction into the urban heart of high-
rise apartment buildings, bringing
suburbanites back from the sprawl.
Some of us are beginning to ask, rather
nervously: Who are the main archi-
tects responsible for these changes?
How do they see their own profession?
What are the main obstacles they are
up against?
In Sydney, the changes have been
most violent (and in looking into the
Australian scene that city can be taken,
and will be here, as an exemplar of
change). The rattle of drills and smell
of dust made living in downtown Syd-
ney a torment for several years; Bridge
Street is now lined with ritzy insurance
offices; Harry Seidler’s formidable
quartz-white Australia Square tower
looms over George Street; the water-
front boasts the opulent flanking towers
of Peddle, Thorp, and Walker’s Gold-
fields House (with the name set aggres-
sively on the top) and the AMP build-
ing; and the Black Stump Ken
Woolley and the Government Archi-
tects’ impressive State Office Block
dominates the windy reaches of
Macquarie Street, while the Opera
House is still being built on Benelong
Point. Looked at from the Bridge, it’s
all a confused jumble, but the Rocks
Scheme, dreamchild of Overall of Can-
berra, and other schemes rather more
vague at present suggest that perhaps
in 15 years’ time it will begin to make
some kind of aesthetic sense. If it
does, it will be because of the work of
a handful of architects who have begun
to dominate the whole of our visual
lives in Sydney, whose styles, at present
conflicting, argue across the skyline as
though the architects themselves had
grown tall and were conducting a
quarrel we must unavoidably watch.
Of these, the most energetic and
dynamic is Harry Seidler. Bow-tied, in
a rather rumpled suit, Seidler a
Canadian whose onslaughts on various
local government authorities have made
news for years, creator of Blues Point
Tower, the most famous of many
blocks of flats, and of some striking
office buildings was far from san-
guine, when I saw him, about the
aesthetic state of Sydney and the
status and training of the architects
who are changing its face. He was
most severe in his onslaught on teach-
ing at the universities (both the Uni-


By CHARLES HIGHAM
versity of Sydney and the University
of New South Wales offer courses):
“Our teachers don’t earn the respect
of students. Here, when a post is free
at a university, what happens? They get
the rejects from England, second-rate
people in obscure academic posts over
there. And here these rejects are in
central positions, where they have in
their hands the whole future of an
environment. It’s tragic. And they can’t
even be sacked.”
Don Gazzard, well known both as
an architect and as author of “Out-
rage,” a ferocious slam at Sydney’s
ugliness, agreed: “You get failed archi-
tects here: minor English academics.
The idea of architecture as a profession
isn’t exciting to young people. Really
top, A-stream people go into' law, medi-
cine, or nuclear physics. Architects
tend to be just people who are ‘good
at drawing’ who are ‘advised to take
up the job.’ The teaching isn’t suf-
ficiently technical: what people learn
about mechanical installations is next
to nothing.” And it wasn’t, he pointed
out, every country that registered archi-
tects immediately they graduated. “In
the United States you pass your uni-
versity course, and you still can’t do
your professional examinations for five
or six years, and when you do get
through, a whole series of examinations
faces you again, and finally you’re into
your thirties.” Here, he told me, you
can get through your finals at 22 or
23, wait six or nine months to get
some practical experience, and then
become a professional architect.
Morton Herman, notable for his ener-
getic restorations of old buildings and
excellent books, similarly felt that the
chief weakness was in the technical
side of teaching, that students weren’t
being sufficiently trained to put their
ideas into concrete form: “They do
beautiful designs on paper, but they
can’t put them into practice. Inspira-
tion is given, but that’s all. Emotional
forms are taught, but once the transla-
tion into actual building comes along
new people strike trouble.” Neverthe-
less, he did feel that a number of good
teachers at the universities carried the
academic deadwood with some success.
Ken Woolley, designer (with others)
of the Fisher Library and the State
Office Block, criticised the overall aca-
demic, as opposed to practical, ap-
proach of the schools: “I began a
master’s thesis myself, on library de-
sign, and abandoned it because I found
that instead of the practical handbook
I wanted to do on techniques they re-
quired a history of the evolution of
library design!” And the powers-that-
be had opposed usefully controversial
theses: a 'colleague of Woolley’s had
submitted a severe critique of an inter-
nationally used system of the classifica-
tion of building materials as his master’s
thesis; this had been sent for judgment
to the very people in England pro-
pounding the system.
One real problem, apart from educa-
tion, was the architect’s lack of stand-
ing in Australia. Harry Seidler put this
down to the national suspicion of the
expert, although Morton Herman
thought that this public suspicion was
gradually disappearing, that it was far
easier for an architect to assume an
air of authority now than it had been,
say, 15 years ago. Don Gazzard said:
“Architecture here has had to change
from a craft to something involving a
technology. Where this change has
taken place in other countries it’s just
starting to happen here. Architecture
used to be a leisurely pursuit where
gentlemen did watercolors and that
sort of thing, and it still has arty over-
tones here.”
He felt that Australian architects
themselves were partly to blame as
there was no real striving for excel-
lence. Part of the problem could be
solved by the giving of really signific-
ant awards for achievements. The
Institute of Architects admittedly gave
awards, but these had little or no real
connection with prestige or success, they
existed just as some vague PR venture
to promote the profession in public.
“You win an award, but you aren’t
likely to get more than one or two
commissions as a result, whereas in the
United States everyone would beat a
path to your door.”
Seidler, among others, felt that not
only education and status were lacking
here but, perhaps still more import-
ant, well-informed clients as well.
“People in Australia who have any
genuine interest in, or understanding of,
architecture represent a very small
fringe indeed. The man in the street
—and here the client is the man in the
street —is only concerned with new-
ness and gadgetry and gimmickry.”
In America, he pointed out, an archi-
tect who works for a corporation deals
with the business leader who is likely
to have real erudition on the subject of
aesthetics in buildings. There’s enor-
mous snobbery there about whom
you’re going to get to do your building,
because business chiefs are conscious of
building public monuments. Clients in
Australia, he claims, aren’t informed;
this really comes down to the basic
question of who becomes the head of
a major company here “In America,
the heads of companies are apt to be
Yale or Harvard graduates. In Aus-
tralia, they will most likely have no
education to speak of at all. Developers
and builders are interested only in giv-
ing the public what it wants, not in
maintaining standards. The public is
virtually uneducated. Aesthetic notions
are apt to be dismissed as ‘too far
out’!”
So it’s up to architects, isn’t it, to
impose standards, or even to pull fast
ones on their clients? “Oh, yes, and we
do pull fast ones all the time. You
simply sell people the thing you think
they should have. And there are a
few who listen. One has to talk to them
like a banker. If you talk aesthetics to
a client you’re wasting your time. You
have to make economic sense, that’s all.
And you’ve still got to manage that
basic appeal to the man in the street.”
Seidler mentioned by contrast with
our own clients’ attitudes the situation
that had occurred with the Seagram
Building in New York. It had, he said,
initially been designed by one archi-
tect, but the daughter of the general
manager of Seagram had insisted on
another man. The great Mies van der
Rohe was brought in, and this resulted
in a superb achievement: You don’t,
he said, find situations like that here.
“It’s unthinkable they should occur.
Our insurance companies, for instance,,
look at them! They go in for cheap-
tricks, for gimmicks!” He savagely
attacked the buildings at the Universi-
ties of N.S.W. and Sydney, contrasting
them unfavorably with the new English
Universities of Leicester and Sussex.
“The campuses here are a disgrace. Just
look at the University of N.S.W.! The
lowest form of human endeavor pos-
sible! Confusion, utter aesthetic chaos!
It is a shame on this country to pro-
duce such a university. And the new
buildings at Sydney are gross, unrelated,
and revolting!”
How did Seidler propose improving
clients’ standards? “We have to edu-
cate them privately. We go to great
lengths with slide-showing and lectures;
we have to brainwash a man to appreci-
ate what we are doing.” That’s talking
him into something, what about talking
him out of something some vulgar
idea which he might seek to impose
on the architect? “We stand very firm
on that score. An architect has to make


a client do what the architect wants.
As the Germans say, he has to have
hair on his teeth! He’s got to be a
bulldozer. He has a duty that is higher
than to the client, to further architec-
ture here in an aesthetic sense.”
Don Gazzard said: “I have been
beaten over things by clients but if I
have it’s been my fault and I should
have been able to persuade them. I
don’t believe architects should say, ‘I
had to do it, my client insisted.’ By
saying that, a man is just admitting
his own failure to persuade, his own
inability to be strong. Of course, I
don’t think architects should be given
complete freedom: a kind of Indo-
nesian confrontation between him and
the client always produces the best
results.”
By contrast, Graham Thorp, suave,
grey-haired designer of the AMP
Building and Bligh House, said that
he found a vast improvement in aes-
thetic understanding by clients in the
past few years: “In the industrial field,
Seidler may be right. But in the office
field and the domestic, definitely not.”
It might, he said, be Seidler’s experi-
ence that clients have no aesthetic
sense, but it wasn’t his. “It’s always
been a precept that good design costs
no more than bad design. If you can’t
design well within the same budget
at a high standard you .can go mow
the lawn. Clients generally understand
that.”
Once clients’ objections had been
overcome and actual building began,
an Australian architect was faced with
a forest of uniquely complex building
regulations, regulations which drove
men like Harry Seidler to helpless
exasperation:
“When we built Blues Point Tower
we argued for years against having
to have sprinklers. But the Government
insisted. The head of the Fire Brigade
had a bee in his bonnet about it. I
said, many other countries have much
higher buildings and they don’t require
\?uch things! And he said, ‘I don’t care.’ ”
Nowadays, Seidler pointed out, fire
stairs in blocks of flats had to be
internally built against the outside
wall, and this created awkward and
costly constructional problems. For 20
years he had fought against wall vents.
“These ventilation things you see in
every flat in Sydney originated with
the gaslight era, and until last month
it was a law that you had to have
them. Imagine the technical problems
and the money you waste, trying to
put them in.”
Don Gazzard said that fire protec-
tion, together with air-conditioning,
could add up to one-third of the
cost of a building. Graham Thorp also
condemned the city’s fire prevention
rules: In the AMP Building alone, he
said, the sprinklers had cost an addi-
tional $300,000 with an annual main-
tenance charge of SBOOO. Thorp
severely criticised the Chief Secretary’s
public buildings committee, formed, he
said, ten years ago: “At committee
meetings, they can have us in tears
about people trapped in the corners
of little rooms. But even when a plane
ran into the side of the Empire State
Building and an engine crashed into a
paint store, there was no fire danger.”
Thorp added that building laws in
general were far behind the times but
the fire protection laws really were
“hopeless.” The authorities, he said,
had been allowed to dictate, against all
the evidence his colleagues had been
able to glean from overseas, an “out-
landish” level of fire safety to such
an extent it was making buildings less
and less economical. In addition to
sprinklers, Thorp said, architects were
limited in using lightweight concrete
structures because the fire authorities
wanted floors thick enough to prevent
fire from eating through them in a fixed
number of hours.
With all these vexations to burden
architects, what can we expect from
them in Sydney in the future? Seidler
wants to see constant exhibitions by
the Council of Industrial Design, clients
turned into informed snobs, and more
happening like installation of a four-
storey-high Calder sculpture in Austra-
lia Square, which he had persuaded
his clients to pay for. (“Not just
things like the Reserve Bank would do,
in a very timid way, with a local art
competition and a prize for something
that doesn’t work.”)
Seidler also wanted to see more
spaces in the city, and less of the kind
of thinking that had prevented him
from building a tunnel connecting Aus-
tralia Square and Wynyard: his clients,
he said, had been willing to pay a
fortune for the tunnel. But the Com-
missioner for Railways demanded that
the client construct escalators inside
Wynyard in return for allowing him to
have the tunnel, and the client would
have had to maintain them at his own
expense for the next 80 years. “Of
course, the Chief Secretary’s Depart-
ment should have insisted that the tun-
nel be built and the authorities pay
for it.”
Graham Thorp with a roster of
18 new buildings in tandem on his
drawing-board at once would like to
see apartments built in the heart of the
city. He wants a separate planning
authority set up under a commissioner
a commissioner who would have con-
tact with architects, businessmen, and
officials but be disinterested com-
mercially; at the universities, he feels,
major overseas architects should teach
for a full academic year, and he and
others had recently helped in this
direction by arranging for distinguished
visitors to talk to postgraduate students
at the University of N.S.W. Don Gaz-
zard also wanted to see far more design
control here.
Two centrally placed figures in the
future of Sydney’s architecture are
Ted Farmer, State Government Archi-
tect, and Nigel Ashton, Chairman of
the State Planning Authority and at
the same time President of the Royal.
Australian Institute of Architects.
Farmer, whose notably enlightened
leadership of his office augurs well,
has a program of S6O-70 million
a year expenditure (S4O million spent
on the State Office Block alone), 500
staff, and a total of 174 practising archi-
tects.
He is very worried about the future
of Sydney, partly because he agreed
with Seidler about Sydney clients: he
felt that Australian builders were doing
a pretty good job by international
standards, but that what we need was
to develop better public taste: “Some
clients, especially in industry, have
pretty dreadful ideas, an obsession with
keeping up with the Joneses. But things
may improve, and people like Robin
Boyd are doing a great deal of good.”
He feared that central Sydney might
die. He had recently had discussions
with the City Planner Lord Llewellyn-
Daves, who had mentioned a town
in Ohio which had literally “died.”
(“It looked like a bomb site.”) What
Farmer wanted was to see the old
Sydney retained right down to the little
domed toilet in Macquarie Place. And
Argyle Place must, he felt, be kept
intact.
Nigel Ashton wanted to see more
contact between the public, the archi-
tect, and the councils which controlled
fire regulations and other related
matters. He sought as someone
with a foot in both official and private
professional camps an improvement
of the more irrational fire regulations
while not in any way sacrificing the
very high standards used here, valuable
work on which was being done, he
said, at the Commonwealth Experimen-
tal Building Station.
Although the problems Gazzard,
Seidler, Thorp, and the other archi-
tects have pointed to are peculiarly
acute in Sydney, they exist in the
other cities as well. Almost everyone
wants to see, in Melbourne, Brisbane,
Adelaide, and Perth, high-rise apart-
ment buildings surrounded by gardens
in the heart of the city, more parking
space, less rigorous building regulations,
and a coming together of architects
and civic bodies in harmony, a total
working out of the great problems of
cities. And yet no one wants to see the
character of those cities lost, the impo-
sition of a coldly impersonal “interna-
tional look” which would make us re-
semble some Pittsburgh in multiple. At
this particular moment, with if we
accept Seidler’s and Gazzard’s strictures
architects’ education leaving some-
thing to be desired, status low, clients
uninformed, regulations still tiresome,
the picture looks grim, but the exist-
ence of a handful of great Australian
buildings and noble visions like
Sydney’s Rocks Scheme can relieve our
pessimism to an extent. The future is
in the hands of the architects: and
perhaps the severity of their criticisms
is the best gauge of their quality, of
the improved standards that may lie
ahead.

Tourists, New Guinea’s new car go
By GEOFFREY PEREGRINE
AS THE BOEING 707 wheeled in over
Port Moresby on Qantas’ first flight
through New Guinea last month, an
errant squall of rain drifted down the
Laoki Valley to make a mockery of
the usually arid dry season. Standing
gamely at the foot of the aircraft steps
was a group of grass-skirted and un-
fortunately floral-brassiered brown girls
bearing piles of sodden frangipani leis.
An hour later as the passengers re-
boarded to fly on to better-known
tourist places like Manila and Hong
Kong, the girls were in place again
—this time to give each visitor a gift
of genuine Trobriand Islands wood
carving. New Guinea has obviously
caught on to the value of the gimmick
in tourist promotion.
Papua-New Guinea needs the money
that tourism can generate. The Terri-
tory is dependent for overseas income
(apart from the Australian grant) on
fluctuating tropical agricultural pro-
ducts like copra, cocoa, and coffee, with
some assistance from timber and a
potential bonanza in Bougainville cop-
per. More than any other industry,
tourism shows the way to quick develop-
ment without heavy calls on outside
finance. And besides this, a developed
tourist industry is something of an
international status symbol.
The task of making this new cargo
cult a reality has been given to Sidney
Moore, the promoter who helped put
Sydney’s Blue Mountains on the trip-
pers’ maps, and more recently was pro-
moting Queensland’s Gold Coast. Four
months ago he was appointed Executive
Officer of the Papua and New Guinea
Tourist Development Board. The
finance for the job of persuading the
world to beat a pathway to the Terri-
tory is mainly from the Administration,
and there is some from the travel
industry. In a tiny office at the dusty
end of Moresby, Sid Moore was happy
to clear boxes of wood carvings
presents Ijpr the next airline arrivals
off a chair so we could sit down and
talk travel. %
Some oldtimers in the Territory say
he won’t succeed. Others are ready to
knock him if he does. Talking around
the town you get the impression that
his job is either hopeless or as easy
as being public relations officer for a
brewery in a desert. But the doubters
are in the minority. Economic develop-
ment, symbolised by tourism, is the new
creed preached everywhere with empha-
sis and conviction, even in the hallowed
Papua Club. To the outsider the flavor
of a civilised cargo cult is quite dis-
tinct.
The wide-open-door policy is all the
more surprising since many of us re-
member the days in Port Moresby
when Uncle Paul Hasluck ran the
show and the Department of Territories
A flip around Rabaul harbor in a dugout for some
southern visitors (top ). After a splendid aerial view of
Port Moresby, visitors are welcomed at the Gateway Hotel
scornfully scotched any attempt to en-
courage sightseers. Hasluck was then
said to take the view that the native
peoples should be protected, their
privacy ensured. There also seemed to
be an attitude in the Department that
Australia had forever to carry out the
slow process of development; that out-
side influences should be excluded and
the Territory people left in their old
patterns of life, made decent only by
good wholesome administration of the
Boy Scout type, and an octopus spread
of health services into every village.
“Hasluck wants to keep this place
as a bloody anthropological zoo,” a
very senior and very frustrated officer
of the Administration once told me.
Now the beckoning rewards of tour-
ism have changed all that. The belief
seems to be that tourists only have to
be talked about and they will
materialise. Professionals, like Sid
Moore, are more realistic. There’s a
quid in tourism all right, they say, but
you have to spend first to attract it.
Draw up a balance sheet and you
have some pretty striking assets. The
Territory has beauty, many unique
attractions, including historic battle-
fields, and an unusual way of life. Its
native peoples and their cultures are a
constant source of interest. But there
are also many drawbacks. Hotel ac-
commodation is inadequate and highly
priced. Internal communications range
from barely adequate to plain awful.
But the spur to develop could well
be in the regular international flights
Qantas now has through Port Moresby.
It looks as though Qantas intends to
promote Papua and New Guinea quite
heavily. The airline has a minor interest
in Fiji Airways, which ties into the
general scheme. Fiji Airways recently
took delivery of a new turbo-prop
H.S. 748 and intends to operate this
40-passenger plane as far as Honiara.
TAA connects with it there and flies
a Friendship through to Port Moresby
(under charter to Qantas).
This circle route through Papua and
New Guinea gives Qantas a unique
selling point in the very competitive
tour markets of North America and
Japan. There is considerable interest in
both areas. After all, during World War
11, both Americans and Japanese com-
pulsorily visited Papua and New Guinea
and the Solomons in large numbers.
Strangely, many survivors want to come
back.
If international tour groups star
heading for the Territory, they win be
moving in big parties with every like i-
hood that the groups will get even
bigger. Tours of more than 100 peop e
are being spoken of as the curren
trend in North America today.
Such a group would be difficult to
accommodate even in Sydney or Mel-
bourne. It would turn Port Moresby
into a shambles. What groups like this
would do to the smaller towns like
Goroka and Mount Hagen is just too
frightening to think about. But, at least,
if you could assemble them in either
Port Moresby or Lae, you could then
circulate them around in bite-sized
lumps.
Business interests in Port Moresby
and Lae seem at last to realise the
problem. The man behind the tinv
Papuan airline Patair, Mr. Cliif Jack-
son, has already opened the contem-
porary Gateway Hotel, right on the air-
strip at Port Moresby. Here he and his
staff have set a standard that only a
handful of places in Sydney (or for that
matter in Tokyo or San Francisco) have
been able to reach. The Gateway offers
only about 35 rooms or so at the
moment, but I understand the company
has plans for another 120.
In Lae, the trading giant of Steam-
ships Ltd. has opened' a new hotel,
which, reports say, will also be very
good.
The realistic way to promote Papua
and New Guinea at the moment seems
to be to make a virtue out of its prob-
lems. If Port Moresby, Lae, and, say,
Rabaul are developed to the stage
where they offer adequate home-from-
home comforts, then bring in the troop-
ing throngs and tell them they’re visit-
ing the last frontier. Warn them that
away from the towns they will probably
have to sleep on camp stretchers in
native-style huts, bounce around in tiny
aeroplanes, and bump over dirt roads.
Make it an adventure.
But temper the discomfort with warm
hospitality. Don’t graft on a Billy But-
lin atmosphere, but open the homes
and towns to visitors as Territorians do
today as a matter of course. Some of
the best times I can recall I enjoyed
on trips through small New Guinea
centres. Wewak, for instance, is the only
town I have been in which awoke one
Sunday morning with a collective and
monumental hangover. It was, I recall,
the morning after the annual bachelors’
ball.
The testing time for the new tourist
policy will come in mid-May next year
when the Highlands Show is held at
Goroka. This show alternates year about
between Goroka and Mount Hagen
(where the last one was held in August).
Make no mistake about it, this is a
spectacle in world class. Already the
professional lecturers and off-the-
beaten-track travellers have heard about
J t in North America, and where they go
the herds follow a few years later. If
the Highlands Show and occasions like
it are developed and promoted, visitors
from Australia and overseas should
come pouring in.


FORUM
Is the RAAF misunderstood?
By PETER ISAACSON
THE RAAF does not deserve the maul-
ing it has received from ill-informed
critics recently. Much of the criticism
stems from a general misconception of
the role of the RAAF in peace, in re-
stricted war (Vietnam), and in total
war. Examination of recent official
papers shows that both the Government
and Air Board consider the major
responsibilities of the RAAF to be:
• The air defence of Australia, her
territories and her overseas bases.
• Offensive operations in support of
Allied Forces.
• Co-operation with other Services
and Allied Forces in defence of sea
communications.
• Transport support for the Army in
the field.
• Strategic airlift for the Australian
Armed Services.
This is a wide and diverse role for
such a small Service as the RAAF. To
maintain the balanced force capable
of carrying out its responsibilities the
RAAF must be equipped and trained
to carry out each of these functions
individually, but if necessary, at the
same time and also to support the
other Services in peace-keeping, limited
war, or counter-insurgency roles.
The RAAF has been charged with
not having sufficient ground control
radar equipment to assist Mirage
fighters. Considered opinion believes it
unlikely that Australian Mirage squad-
rons will be deployed in areas where
a sophisticated ground control radar
environment is not in existence. Never-
theless, two full air-transportable,
mobile radar units, capable of deploy-
ment at very short notice, are on order
and will be delivered to the RAAF
within six months.
The use of the Canberra as an
attack aircraft has been criticised, yet
the facts prove that the Canberra,
obsolete though it might be as a
bomber, is ideally suited for the Army
support work it has been doing in Viet-
nam. Obsolescence in one role does
not mean total obsolescence and the
Canberra is still a valuable aircraft as
a component of the RAAF’s balanced
force.
The Fill is constantly being com-
pared with the Phantom, to the dis-
advantage of the former, yet the facts
prove that even at the greatly higher
price the Fill is by far the better
aircraft, particularly for the RAAF,
which requires versatility from its
equipment rather than superiority in
a specialised field.
The RAAF needs an aircraft capable
of long flights. Carrying a weapon load
inferior to the Fill, the Phantom, even
on the relatively short-range operations
from Thailand to Vietnam, requires at
least two and sometimes three in-flight
refuellings. Bearing in mind that the
Fill, as an offensive aircraft, is likely
to operate from secure bases on the
Australian mainland, a change to the
Phantom would mean greatly increased
expense for the maintenance of a re-
fuelling fleet. Operational experience
in Vietnam has also shown that the
Phantom lacks the capability of flying
through heavily defended areas and is
insufficiently equipped to penetrate the
electronic screen which is the first line
of defence against offensive operations.
Even Indonesia has a very extensive
and efficient radar cover which would
inhibit operations by the Phantom. The
Phantom was therefore rejected by
the RAAF on at least three major
grounds—insufficient range; insufficient
fire-power; and ineffective counter-radar
equipment.
The Fill will be four times as
effective as the Phantom in short-range
tactical operations, can operate from
secure Australian bases to all known
potential targets, and is capable of
penetrating both gun-defended and
electronically defended screens. The
Fill is the only aircraft which fully
meets the following RAAF specifications
for a long-range strike aircraft:
• Supersonic speed at all altitudes.
• Sufficient range for world-wide
deployment without in-flight refuelling.
• Capable of penetrating sophisticated
ground and air defences, of reaching
its target and delivering a heavy
weapon pay-load with accuracy in all
weather conditions.
• Capable of operations from austere
bases with a minimum of manpower
and support equipment.
Reports from the two instructor
crews undergoing training in the United
States confirm the wisdom of the
RAAF’s choice.
Junior Army officers continually
charge that: “The RAAF, preoccupied
by fighters and bombers, has neglected
Army support.” This was the com-
ment of a CMF officer in The Bulletin
recently. The author ignored the fact
that the Army can only be successful
if air superiority has first been
achieved and this is the Air Force’s
first responsibility. Both RAAF and
Army helicopter operations in Vietnam
would be impossible if the enemy were
able to interfere from the air. The
balanced equipment of the RAAF
affords the Army some guarantee of
safety from air attack, freedom of
movement for helicopter, transport and
troop movement operations, and, as
aircraft become more favorable, close
offensive support.
Despite their success with light air-
craft for such tasks as artillery spotting,
it would be impossible for Army pilots
to acquire the special skills and exper-
tise required for close offensive support
operations. This is the role of the
Air Force, one for which it is trained
and which it has proved in Malaya,
Korea, and in Vietnam that it can
carry out successfully.
Over the past few years the RAAF
has built up squadrons of short- and
medium-range transport aircraft, cap-
able of ferrying lightly equipped in-
fantry to the centre of operations. No
Air Force in the world can sustain an
army engaged in continuous operations
for an indefinite period. Heavy equip-
ment, supplies, and large-scale rein-
forcements must still come overland.
Nevertheless, the RAAF element of
Hercules and Caribou transports gives
Australian Forces the greatest capacity
of mobility by aircraft under their own
control than ever before. At the same
time as it has been supplying troops
in Vietnam, the RAAF has moved
more than 4000 troops quickly and
efficiently from Australia to Vietnam.
In view of the money being spent
on training, aircraft, aerodromes, bases,
and general equipment, Australians are
justified in expecting a high degree of
efficiency from the RAAF. This is being
achieved by the purchase of aircraft
which are best suited to ensure the
defence of the Australian mainland
and territories and of meeting other
situations such as the counter-insurgency
operations now being undertaken in
Vietnam.
By mid-1968 the RAAF will be com-
pletely re-equipped with hardware
which will completely transform the
Service into the most powerful force
in its peace-time history. In addition
to the still-useful Canberra bombers
and Sabre fighters, it will have:
• FlllCs, the most powerful and ver-
satile strike reconnaissance aircraft in
the world.
• Mirage jet fighters which proved
their war-winning capacity in the recent
Israeli-Arab conflict.
• Orion maritime reconnaisance air-
craft, latest long-range defence against
marauding submarines and naval fleets.
• Hercules long-range transports.
• Caribou medium-range transports.
• A substantial helicopter force.
• The Macchi jet trainer.
• Mobile control and reporting radar
units which are the most advanced
equipment of this kind ever to come
out of the defence laboratories.

highly decorated Pathfinder pilot of
World War 11.

OVERSEAS
Planning how to get
away from LBJ
By ANTHONY HOWARD
ONE OF THE best-known principles
of American politics is that in order to
dislodge any office-holder—be he Presi-
dent or merely a County Sheriff—you
must first of all find an attractive
candidate to run against him. The most
noticeable change to have come about
in the past few weeks is the acceptance
on the part of anti-LBJ Democrats
that there is no way of getting round
this harsh fact of American political
life.
Perhaps the most loosely guarded
secret in Washington concerns the con-
versations that leaders of the “Dump
Johnson” movement have lately been
conducting with prominent critics of
the President in the Senate. Their first
approach was the obvious and predict-
able one. One Saturday night last
month, two of the chief organisers of
the anti-LBJ movement were received
by appointment at Senator Robert
Kennedy’s home, Hickory Hill, in
Virginia. Revealingly, their purpose
was not so much to plead with the
Senator as to issue an ultimatum to
him.
If Kennedy wanted to become the
standard-bearer of the Party’s dissidents,
then naturally no other candidate would
even be considered, but the rebels in
the Democratic Party could not wait
for ever —and if Kennedy was not pre-
pared to make a move soon (which, it
was suggested, could initially be a
modest one, such as publicly withdraw-
ing the fulsome endorsement he gave to
the President at a Party banquet in New
York last spring), then approaches
would inevitably have to be made else-
where. Nor, if their current invitation
was turned down, could there ever be
any second chance.
Whoever agreed to take on Johnson
in next year’s primaries was entitled
to a firm promise that he would not be
abandoned in favor of a more exciting
figure if the bandwagon suddenly
started to roll.
Accounts of Bobby Kennedy’s reac-
tion to this confrontation vary, the
adjectives used to describe his de-
meanor ranging from “tempted” to
“tormented.” But what is clear is that
In the end the well-known Kennedy
caution prevailed. The emissaries were
certainly not sent away with any flea
in their ears. Nor, on the other hand,
were they offered any crumb of comfort
or hope.
The Senator, indeed, may well have
assumed that, for all his visitors’ brave
talk, they would experience consider-
able difficulty in finding any rival
champion. At the very least, therefore,
he could afford to play for time. It
was a plausible enough assumption, but,
as events are .working out, it begins to
look increasingly as if it may have
been a mistaken one.
No one is claiming that the anti-LBJ
Democrats are yet in a position to
Gene McCarthy...
“the standard-bearer?”
announce that a serious front-ranking
political challenger is available to run
on an anti-Vietnam platform against
the President in next year’s primaries.
But there are a growing number of
reports and rumors—and, interestingly,
they all focus on one man. He is
Senator Eugene McCarthy, the 51-
year-old senior Senator from Minnesota,
who three years ago was almost chosen
by LBJ to be his Vice-President in
preference to Hubert Humphrey.
The sudden McCarthy boom among
disillusioned Libeials in the Paity may
Partly the consequenc e of no more
than a coincidence. For this past week
has seen the publication of a book by the
Senator in which he trenchantly sets out
all his disagreements with the current
direction of American foreign policy.
Entitled ‘The Limits of Power,” and
concluding with the warning “America’s
contribution to world civilisation must
be more than a continuous performance
demonstration that we can police the
planet,” the book represents in effect
an endorsement and extension of the
thesis that Senator Fulbright has tire-
lessly been preaching to the nation
recently.
The difference, however, between the
two men is that, whereas Senator Ful-
bright partly for reasons of his
Southern origin is not marketable as
a national candidate, Gene McCarthy
undoubtedly is.
For some years before his promise
was overshadowed by that of his exact
contemporary and fellow Catholic,
John F. Kennedy he was widely
considered to be one of the Democratic
Party’s most hopeful prospects for the
Presidency. And even today he is gen-
erally taken to be one of the best
orators in the nation.
One picture dominates his office on
Bobby Kennedy...the “Dump Johnson”
crowd approached him first
Capitol Hill, and 0 in a way it sums
up the man. It is a huge photograph
of him making the nomination speech
for Adlai Stevenson at the 1960 Demo-
cratic Convention a speech delivered
at a time when everyone knew the
cause was hopeless but which still some-
how managed to steal the whole show
that week in Los Angeles. On it there
is an inscription that triumphantly
contrives to suggest that the civilised
man should not take any of these things
tOO ser iously. It reads: “To Gene Mc-
Carthy with affection, gratitude, and
everlasting memories of my finest hour
__ Adlai Stevenson.”
T
, Like Stevenson who was his idol and
her °. McCarthy has often in the past
been ciiticised for being politically m-
effective. And certainly it is true that
there is more, in him of the romantic
than the realist, of the dreamer than
th e operator, of the free intellectual
than of the Party hack,
Yet it is, of course, precisely these
qualities that make him in so many


ways the ideal choice as the anti-LBJ
standard-bearer. For the moment the
Senator himself beyond confirming
that he has held “certain conversations”
-—is saying nothing. But there was a
striking note of conviction in a remark
made by one of his friends last week.
“You know,” he said, “I really think
he’s going to do it.” If he does, it is
hard to know who will be the more
put out Lyndon Johnson or Bobby
Kennedy.
U.S. Negroes
Drop in the ghetto
THERE IS TO BE no big new job-
creating drive in the Negro ghettos
this year now that a curious alliance
of conservative Senators and Adminis-
tration supporters has defeated two
schemes which would have added about
U.S.$l billion a year for this purpose
to the $2.3 billion authorised by the
Senate for the poverty program in 1967-
Father James Groppi, the Catholic priest who is fighting for open housing as an
end to the segregated poverty of the Negro ghettos across the U.S.
68. The additional money would have
been chopped off in the House of Rep-
resentatives in any case, but the Admin-
istration’s contention that a country
facing a deficit of some U.S.$ 29 billion
could not afford it carried the day
in the Senate as well. In a minor
rebellion the Senate added nearly $2OO
million to the Administration’s request;
Senator Clark, the Bill’s sponsor (and
the author of the defeated plan for a
big drive on Negro joblessness), fought
hard for these millions, partly in the
knowledge that he will need “wiggle
room” for manoeuvre when he comes
to confer with the men from the House.
There both the money for the poverty
program and the very existence and
powers of the agency which manages it,
the Office of Economic Opportunity,
are in danger.
Yet even the President’s own com-
mission on the riots is believed to have
come to the conclusion that the best
preventive lies in providing jobs and
training for jobs. Ingeniously Mr. John-
son has found a way to show that he
agrees, even if the state of the Budget
and of Congress forbids a big'
federal program. He has announced a
pilot scheme to interest businessmen
in providing employment and job-
training in half a dozen or so poverty
areas, both urban and rural. Any
businessman who has a proposal can
now go to a single office in the De-
partment of Commerce; this is to be
headed, at least for the first few months,
British Defence White Paper
The rest of the picture
IT NOW SEEMS that last July’s
announcement of the British Govern-
ment’s intention to withdraw forces
from Singapore and Malaysia by
about 1975 was only half the picture.
Next February’s Defence White
Paper will show that the mobile
capability planned to follow the
withdrawal of permanent East-of-
Suez garrisons will be severely
limited in both duration and scope.
Britain is quickly rewriting itself as
a purely European power.
Ministers would not even he
worried if Britain’s total disengage-
ment—now envisaged in the 1980s—
were accelerated by events, such as
seems certain to happen in South
Arabia.
The attempt to reduce the burden
of overseas commitments, particu-
larly in view of continuing pressure
on the pound, suggests uncompromis-
ing decisions on the following points:
The South-East Asia Treaty
Organisation:
Assignment of British Forces for
SEATO. “Planning purposes” to he
reduced to vanishing point.
The Anglo-Malaysian Defence
Treaty:
The Malaysian Forces will cease to
rely on British aid and support after
about 1975.
The Persian Gulf:
British Forces will be withdrawn in
the early 19705. Contrary to sugges-
tions that the current huild-up means
new involvements, its aim is simply
to prevent Bahrein and Kuwait be-
coming prey to neighbors, and to
give local rulers a last chance to
compose differences.
The Indian Ocean
Plans to build a “transit station”
on the island of Alabra may be dis-
carded. A decision is expected before
the northern winter is out.
The Fill Swing-wing Plane:
Its chief use will be to deter
military adventures by Malaysia’s
neighbors during the critical period
of Britain’s disengagement. Had the
present defence trend been foreseen
two years ago it might not have
been ordered.
The Far East Amphibious Force:
This will have a strictly limited
“fire brigade” role, with an eye on
internal security in remaining small
colonies such as Fiji and Mauritius
(both with explosive racial tensions)
and also Hong Kong.
Although these decisions complete
the reversal of the Government’s
East-of-Suez policy, announced by
Mr. Wilson in 1964, they are not ex-
pected to surprise Washington,
which is thought to have written off
Britain as a “partner in Asia” some
time ago.

by Mr. William Zisch, the vice-
chairman of the Aerojet-General Cor-
poration, a firm of imagination and
public spirit which has already estab-
lished a tent-making factory in the Los
Angeles ghetto, the scene of the first
big Negro riot.
An additional charm of the scheme is
that it will add nothing to government
spending, since all the federal contribu-
tion is to come from existing programs.
It is hoped that business, will invest be-
tween $2OO million and $3OO million
and that the scheme will be working
before next summer’s riot season.
Yet, as Senator Robert Kennedy
points out, this is little enough; legisla-
tion, moreover,, would provide a
guarantee of continuity for investors
which is lacking in the avowedly experi-
mental White House project. Nor is
taking the risk out of slum investment
quite the same as putting profit into it.
Nevertheless, a handful of large firms is
said to be interested.
Chinese warning
Dirt and deceit
IT SEEMS THAT no sphere of life is
free from the influence of the Cultural
Revolution and China’s Red Guards
have created a new literary style for
commercial dealings. Lengthy quota-
tions from Mao are a must even in
expensive cables. One of the best
examples of this “new style” of doing
business comes from an issue of the
Singapore “Straits Times.” The China
National Light Industrial Products
Import and Export Corporation of
Shanghai inserted the following “state-
ment”:
“The toilet soaps handled for export
by our corporation and sold on the
Singapore market are mainly available
in the brands of Bee and Flower, Jade
Leaf, Green Leaf, and Sin Hwa. Under
the superiority of socialist system, our
workers with a high consciousness and
a strong sense of responsibility to con-
sumers use choice materials for manu-
facturing these toilet soaps, which prove
to be fine and neat, rich in lather,
elegant and pleasant in fragrance,
capable of nourishing the skin, removing
its dirts, but leaving the sweet odor.
Consequently, they are most liked and
accepted as a daily necessary by the
broad masses.
“To our deep regret, however, it has
been recently discovered that quite a
number of toilet soaps imitating the
Chinese products, such as with Chinese
characters printed on their wrapping
paper, are now appearing on some
markets. Materials used for these sham
soaps are of inferior and coarse quality.
The unscrupulous merchants do the
falsification purposely to mix the
genuine with the spurious to cheat the
users and to snatch the superfluous
profits, thus resulting in spoiling the
reputation of Chinese products. Their
practice is utterly spiteful and vicious.
“Now, we solemnly declare that the
said sham toilet soaps are by no means
our products; and buyers or users must
distinguish in order to shun the deceit.
We have to warn sternly the unscru-
pulous merchants against continuing the
abovenrentioned fraud and trickery.”
Kuala Lumpur and Singapore have
a rooted objection to Chinese Com-
munism in any shape or form, with the
exception of mutually profitable busi-
ness transactions—and Mao thought, in
this instance, seemed to be in harmony
with that exception.

Review," Hong Kong.)

Jolly Green Giants to the rescue
THE UNITED STATES has lost more
than 700 planes over North Vietnam.
Some of them no official will 'say
how many flew from the six
American-built bases in Thailand.
Wounded pilots lucky enough to
bring their damaged craft back to their
home field are immediately flown to
military hospitals in the Philippines if
the injuries are serious. Otherwise they
are treated at Thai base hospitals. '
The American Government spares no

effort to get its pilots back to safety,
but sometimes it wants no publicity.
Rescue helicopters, known affection-
ately as Jolly Gieen Giants, fly regu-
larly from the large base at Udorn in
north-east Thailand. They occasionally
use the less developed field at Nakhon
Phanom, also in the north-east.
The choppers, preceded by tactical
fighters with the mission of suppressing
ground fire, fly over Laos into North
Vietnam to pick up downed American
pilots. Rescues have been made as far
north as Dien Bien Phu, near the
Chinese border.

Men who prefer only the finest pipe tobacco, smoke Amphora. And for
good reason. Tobacco specialists in Holland select the world's choicest
tobacco leaves for Amphora blends. Each leaf is masterfully mellowed and
blended to make every pipeful of Amphora consistently excellent. And
downright satisfying. So pick a pouch of Amphora . . . it’s Australia's
leading imported pipe tobacco and there are three blends to suit all tastes.

controlled by the Thai Government.
American officials emphasise that they
are Thai bases only being used by U.S.
planes and pilots. In fact, it was only a
few months ago that the Thai Govern-
ment publicly announced the existence
of the bases. By then it had become
known throughout the world that the
Americans were using Thailand as a
staging platform for the air war in
Vietnam. Royal Thai Air Force planes
used the bases, but the ambiance is
distinctively American.
South-East Asia seems to provide the
right kind of atmosphere for unmarked
aircraft to fly in. Thailand is no excep-
tion, particularly at bases near the Laos
border. More than 20 unmarked T-28
trainers could easily be seen at one
base. Almost an equal number of the
sturdy, all-purpose piston-engine planes
were marked with Royal Thai Air
Force insignia.
Air America, which has been identi-
fied as a Central Intelligence Agency
Hanoi picture of a U.S.
airman captured last month
operation, has a number of its planes
on bases in north-east Thailand. They
are marked Air America at least
some of them.
The Nakhom Phanom base, not ex-
tensively developed at this time, will
have considerably greater strategic
importance when the United States
builds a fortified buffer strip between
North and South Vietnam. According
to a military attache from a Western
embassy in Bangkok, the U.S. might
extend the fortified barrier across the
narrow neck of Laos to the Thai bor-
der. This would be designed to cut off
the “Ho Chi Minh Trail,” by which
the Communists ferry men and supplies
to South Vietnam. The Nakhom Pha-
nom base is located fairly near what
might be the western end of this pro-
posed Maginot Line. How the Laotian
Government would react to such a
proposal no one is quite certain.

Economic Review, Hong Kong.)


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Where are the guidelines for
Federal-State relations?
OFFICIALS IN CANBERRA are get-
ting increasingly contemptuous of the
Government’s dilatory and indecisive
approach to Commonwealth - State
financial relations. Eighteen months
ago it was agreed a fullscale review
would be carried out. In fact, there
had been plenty of investigations within
the Treasury long before that. A uni-
versity lecturer was actually appointed
as a special assistant to one such in-
vestigation about three years ago. He
worked at the Treasury for a year. The
Government’s advisers have plenty of
alternative suggestions of an adminis-
trative nature. It is not their business
to delve into the politics of the sub-
ject, but in fact no one will do this.
No one will face up to the problem of
laying down some political guidelines
for the officials to work to.
The Western Australians, meanwhile,
unilaterally innovated by turning stamp
duty into a general turnover-income
tax (perhaps “transactions tax” would
be the most accurate description). They
did it quietly and unprovocatively.
Then, last month, Victoria’s Bolte sud-
denly woke up and decided to follow
suit, though he hit on another name.
It would be a “receipts tax.” And un-
like the more subtle Western Austra-
lians, Bolte decided to introduce his
new measure with the silence and grace
of a large bomb going off. He made
sure his legislation contained a specific
provision making Victorians on the
payroll of the Commonwealth liable
to pay the tax on their earnings. Mr.
Holt himself, as a Victorian, would
have to pay it on his salary and
allowances.
Commonwealth Ministers just didn’t
know what to do. Then the Labor
Party decided to get its financial ex-
perts (or claimants of that title) to-
gether to try to bash out a Labor line.
In an almost farcical response the
Liberals said “we too” with Mr. Bolte
claiming that “We thought of it first.”
“It” presumably is some sort of magic
solution.
In fact, this sort of partisan dis-
cussion is no solution at all. The
matter has to be settled by govern-
ments, or more specifically by the Com-
monwealth Government. It has domin-
ant powers under the Constitution in tax
matters, and it is for it to decide what
sort of a system it will allow. To
allow the discussions to break into
irrelevant Party lines is simply to lay
the ground for accusations of par-
tisanship.
And all this while the man supposed
to be running the show is out of the
country.
Premier Bolte...a large bomb
Double tax
Toil and trouble
THE GOVERNMENT has got itself
into a mess with its tax negotiations
with the Japanese. After years of in-
termittent work officials had finally
reached agreement with their Japanese
counterparts on a way of breaking this
years-old barrier to commerce between
Australia and Japan. All in time for
announcement before the Japanese
Prime Minister turned up.
The only snag was contacting Mr.
McMahon, the Treasurer, to get his
final approval. He was in South
America. Either communications are
very bad or else Mr. McMahon had
more urgent matters to attend to, be-
cause anxious officials just couldn’t get
a reply. Over to Acting Treasurer Bury.
He would look at it. Days pass and he
decides he had better not make a de-
cision over Mr. McMahon’s head. Mr.
Holt, keen to announce the new agree-
ment on Mr. Sato’s arrival, looked at
the thing and ordered Mr. Bury to OK
it. And then at the last minute the
Brits, clever as ever, step in and say
that it will complicate matters if the
Japanese agreement is signed before the
new Australia-Britain one.
So, confused and indecisive, Mr.
McMahon’s colleagues think perhaps
they’d better backtrack and leave it
to Billy after all.
Trade fair
Goods for industry
TRADE FAIRS USED to be showy
affairs, with the accent on consumer
goods and public appeal. But no
more. In keeping with current over-
seas trends, this year’s fourth Interna-
tional Trade Fair, which opens in
Sydney this week (with 12 nations
showing products worth more than $l2
million), is purely a “trade” fair, con-
centrating on goods for industry,
science, and “non-consumer” customers.
The consumer goods in the fair will
be promoted toward distributors and
agents instead of the general public,
who will be admitted for only three
days of its nine-day run.
Japan and Britain (which Japan
has replaced as Australia’s best cus-
tomer) have the biggest displays at the
fair. The British are staging their
largest show of products here since the
1964 British Exhibition. Other partici-
pants include two Iron Curtain coun-
tries (East Germany and Rumania),
three Common Market countries
(West Germany, Belgium, and Luxem-
burg), three Asian countries (India,
Indonesia, and Nationalist China), and
Malta.
No booms
A wise safeguard
THE TREND TOWARD more con-
servative financing by companies since
the spate of losses following the 1960
boom has had a rather dampening in-
fluence all round the economy these
past few years; its continuance is prob-
ably one of the best safeguards we have
against a boom psychology getting
business in its grip again. Talking in
Melbourne to the chartered accountants
last week, Mr. R. D. Eabry, executive
director of Merchant Bills Corporation,
said the three outstanding facets of the
trend had been a swing toward more
secured borrowing, higher retentions
percentages of profits by companies, and
a lowering of gearing by retailers.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
FOr the economy: The Bureau of Agricultural
Economics, in its first estimate for 1967-68, believes farm
incomes will go 9 percent lower than in 1966-67—53105 m.
compared with $3416m. . . . Wool receipts for the first three
months of the current year have reached $ 107.3 m., against
1966-67’s corresponding $133.4m.; average greasy prices at
39.9 cents a lb. contrast with the previous 49.26 cents.
New and increased lending commitments by the trading
banks averaged $30.7m. a week during September;
August’s average was $32.6m. and September, 1966, $25.8m.
For the markets: A measure of unsteadiness seized
Australian share markets, penetrating both industrials and
miners.
Equities held reasonably firm in London in the face of
poor September trade figures and sterling’s weakness . . .
Moderate dealings on Wall Street saw most industrials
move within a narrow range.
For companies! As is not unusual, BHP-Esso found
no difficulty in capturing the week. First came that prodigious
phrase “a show of hydrocarbons” in Dolphin A-l, then,
more ambiguously, a water contact “well above” the 4088 ft.
depth. The pair also decided to form a transmission com-
pany to bring Gippsland off-shore gas to N.S.W. . . . BHP
alone, through its Commonwealth Steel subsidiary, has bought
Crucible Steel Australia Pty. to make special tool and die
steels locally.
Other extractors were far from inactive . . . Broken Hill
South continues drilling and a comprehensive engineering
study of its Queensland phosphate deposits; its 76 2-3rds
percent-owned Cobar made $959,874 in 1966-67, against the
previous year’s $516,891 loss . . . Consolidated Gold Fields
Australia indicated that Goldsworthy Mining’s W.A. iron
ore earned a pre-tax profit of $4,812,000 in the first full
year . . . Beach sands miner Mineral Deposits, owned by
America’s National Lead, is to float off a 13 percent interest
to Australians . . . Tableland Tin slid disastrously from
$418,057 to $118,784, suffering adverse grades and prices, so
dividend catapulted from 35 to 5 percent . . . Western
Titanium proposes a one-for-eight issue at 100 percent
premium in November and a 20 cents call on contributings in
December . . . Australian Oil and Gas will pay a second
4 cent dividend.
To some relief Concrete Industries made up a 5 percent
dividend by a 3 percent final when earnings moved from
$1,506,070 to $1,969,860 on much lower provisions; North
West Cape isn’t taken into account . . . Quarry and concrete-
servicing group Blue Metal Industries reached a peak
$2,552,695, 6£ percent ahead of 1965-66, held 15 percent
and looked forward to a good 1967-68 . . . ARC Industries
sees better demand and sensible pricing; it has made a cash
purchase of Stewart and Lloyds Pty.’s steel reinforcing
interests.
A “cost explosion” was one way of putting Ansett’s
decline from $3,967,770 to $3,267,478; 10 percent remains
inviolate . . . Shipper Mcllwraith McEacharn dropped from
$669,773 to $512,809, but not the percent .. . Burns Philp-
is to lose its Federal Government subsidy for shipping services
between Australia and New Guinea.
Assembler and distributor Australian Motor Industries
awaits rising costs and only steady sales throughout the
current year . . . Parts maker Duly and Hansford fetched
earnings from $226,006 to $312,876 and dividend from 6| to
1\ percent.
“Less favorable” is also the tone announced by pastoralist
Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort, which also noted pressure
on its lending facilities . . . British-owned Australian
Mercantile Land and Finance kept 13 percent on a $908,942
profit (previously $762,368).
MEN AND MATTERS
WHAT WITH KENNETH MYER
holding up a passenger plane at Essen-
don for an hour or so and Sir Edgar
Coles opting out of his share of the
top managerial spot in G. J. Coles in
favor of Norman, the youngest of the
four brothers, two of whom started the
stores with a single one at Collingwood
about half a century ago, the VIPs of
Bourke Street were looking for let-outs
last week. Myer had a pretty good
excuse, but Sir Edgar hardly needed one
after 27 years as joint managing
director and forty-eight all told with
the firm. Anyway, he’s staying on as
chairman, and brother Norman at 60
still has a lot to give going on the
longevity displayed by his three elder
brothers. He’s been with Coles for 44
years or so, was secretary for sixteen
of them and has been a director for
the past eighteen, including deputy
chairman since 1961.
Slightly less titanic nationally, The
Leviathan, with windows on the Swans-
ton Street corner of Bourke Street for
the past 115 years, ages before Myer
and Coles were ever thought of, was
celebrating its highest profit through all
those long crowded years on the city’s
shopping walks. In this ageless play
there was no prouder man than the
general manager, Max Raby, who
joined the firm from the Fitzroy Central
School when he was fifteen, thirty-
three years back, and has been serving
it in virtually every capacity ever since,
except for four years with the RAAF.
This man, who started off sweeping the
floors in the Bourke Street store, now
has four Melbourne branches under his
wing. When he’s not walking to, in,
and around them, he’s most likely to be
found in the rough at Kingston Heath
golf links, or, perhaps, in the bar.
THE STRUGGLE for control of
Swallow and Ariell in 1964 between
the Arnott group and Nabisco of the
U.S. was one of the biggest brokers’
battles in Australian financial history,
as J. B. Weres and lan Potters con-
fronted each other across the trading
room floor of the Melbourne Stock Ex-
change. Seeing how much the brokers
made out of it seems to have in-
fluenced Mr. F. T. Derham, then Swal-
low’s chairman and managing director,
to join their ranks; this week he opened
a Melbourne branch office for the Syd-
ney stockbroking firm of Philips,
Kitchen and Co.
Fred Derham, grandson of Thomas
Swallow who founded the biscuit com-
pany in 1854, was a biochemist (he had
done a science degree at Melbourne
University after leaving Melbourne
F. T. Derham
Max Raby
Grammar) who worked through the
various sections of Swallows, on the
factory floor, in the laboratory, and
into the management, before becoming
chairman and managing director on the
death of his father in 1959.
He stayed on with Swallows for a
while after Arnotts eventually won the
biscuit battle, chalking up 21 years*
experience in the business, but left in
1965 to complete the Master of Business
Administration degree course from Mel-
bourne University that he had begun
part time in 1964 (he has still to sub-
mit his thesis). Now, at 47, with a
wife and young son, he is starting a
new career, just as his brother —now
marketing director of Bowater Scott in
Melbourne —had to do.


The drift away from Britain
AUSTRALIA’S TOP trade officials,
under the permanent head of the De-
partment of Trade and Industry, Sir
Alan Westerman, have been in Britain
for the past three weeks trying to re-
negotiate the British-Australian trade
agreement —and this at a time when
Britain is trying to join the European
Common Market, when British-Aus-
tralian trade has been declining as
proportion of the trade of both coun-
tries, and when the Australian Govern-
ment has recently reduced tariff pref-
erences on British goods as its contri-
bution to the Kennedy Round (British
preferences for Australian goods also
were cut, but not by the same amount).
The parting of the ways between Aus-
tralia and Britain has entered a new
phase, according to Stefan Mendel-
sohn, the “Economist’s” special corres-
pondent. In a report on Australia, he
says that British exports to Australia
could actually start falling instead of
just holding their ground, and notes
that a fast-growing proportion of Aus-
tralia’s reserves are now being held in
American dollars rather than sterling.
His report continues: Everyone knows
that America and Japan are edging
out Britain as Australia’s main trad-
ing partner and most people are familiar
by now with some of the dreary statis-
tics shoving how Britain’s share of
the Australian market has shrunk from
about a half to a quarter since the
19505.
British exports to Australia could be
on the point of a nosedive, though it is
still too early to be sure about this.
Until now, British exports have been
declining only as a proportion of all
exports to Australia; because the Aus-
tralian market has kept growing, British
exports to the Commonwealth have still
managed to rise modestly in value.
Indeed, they were up 3| percent in
the year to this June after dropping by
a very modest \ percent in the year to
mid-1966. But the current figures are
far less important here than the under-
lying situation that is working against
the British exporter in Australia, and
from now on British exports there could
start actually falling off, perhaps sub-
stantially, for several reasons.
The main one is Japan, which has
already displaced Britain as Australia’s
main customer. Australian exports to
Japan are going to shoot up still more
dramatically from this point on as
mineral shipments get under way in
real earnest, and Japan’s already un-
favorable balance of payments with Aus-
tralia is therefore going to widen still
further on trade alone, not to mention
additional Japanese investment in Aus-
tralia to fill some of the gap left by
British and American capital curbs.
Understandably, Japan is pressing ener-
getically for still more access to the
Australian market for its own exports,
and it is hard to see this pressure being
resisted, even though many Japanese
exports would give Australia’s much-
protected industries a rude if healthy
shock.
Inevitably, the further opening up of
Australia to other people’s exports is
going to hit British exports directly. At
the Kennedy Round negotiations in
Geneva this year the Australian nego-
tiators offered substantial reductions in
British preferential tariffs rather than
general tariff cuts. British exports are
also hurt, though less directly, by the
bilateral trade agreements Australia has
been signing with Russia and east
European countries following the earlier
pact with Japan. Meanwhile, Mr.
McEwen, the Minister for Trade and
Industry, wants to renegotiate the
British-Australian trade agreement,
which expired in 1962 and remains in
being only by mutual courtesy, and
which, he says, gives preferential treat-
ment to 90 percent of Britain’s ex-
ports to Australia, but only 65 percent
of Australia’s exports to Britain.
Capital restraints seem to have slowed
down investment in Australia more
effectively in Britain’s case than
America’s, and hence British exports
could be hit here, too. American and
Japanese exports to Australia have gone
on rising partly because direct invest-
ment from these two countries is chan-
nelled heavily into Australia’s new
mines, thus helping to ensure that
lucrative orders for the expensive
capital equipment needed go to Ameri-
can and Japanese manufacturers. And
American exports are being bolstered
further by Australia’s fast-rising mili-
tary expenditures now that Australian
defence is linked so closely to America’s.
Inevitably, the composition of Aus-
tralia’s official reserves has begun to
reflect the changing pattern of Austra-
lian trade and of overseas investment
in Australia. The proportion of reserves
held in sterling has now slumped to
60 percent, from 80 percent as recently
as 1960.
Given the big swing that has already
taken place in Australian trade and
overseas borrowing, it is hardly sur-
prising that the dollar content of Aus-
tralia’s reserves has risen twelve-fold
over the past 17 years and three-fold
since 1960. The surprising feature is
that American dollars still constitute
only 20 percent of total reserves,
although almost half of Australia’s
capital inflow now comes from America
and a third of its export earnings from
America, Japan, and Canada.
The Australian Reserve Bank seems
to use its combined gold and U.S. dol-
lar holdings as an ultimate, hard-core
reserve, much as other countries use
gold alone for this purpose. While ster-
ling balances shift up or down with
swings in the balance of payments,
dollar and gold holdings seem to be
built up slowly but steadily, no matter
whether the country is running an ex-
ternal surplus or deficit. If British
exports to Australia now start falling
substantially, which seems possible,
then the U.S. dollar content of the
Australian reserves could start rising
still faster than it has been.
The Reserve Bank’s policy is to
accumulate gold sold to it by Australian
producers. But although its gold hold-
ings have thus risen almost every year
since 1951, and more than doubled in
this period from $BB million to $204
million at the end of July this year,
they still comprise only 17 percent of
total reserves (compared with 90 per-
cent in the United States, 78 percent
in France, and 63 percent in Britain).
And even if one counts Australia’s com-
bined gold and U.S. dollar holdings
as an approximate equivalent of other
people’s gold reserves, these together
still total only 40 percent of all Aus-
tralia’s reserves. By that standard, Aus-
tralia shows very great readiness to
trust the pound.


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
No comfort for the
accountants
in "true and fair"
BY J. C. HORSFALL
MOST LEADING accountants of my
acquaintance, from Sir Alex Fitzgerald
downwards, have impressed strongly on
me that accountancy is based on
principles rather than a set of rules to
be applied in drawing up accounts, and
that the main problem confronting
them is to get a common basis for the
preparation of company accounts and
for the principles involved in it. Every
now and again we hear of some accoun-
tancy body restating the problem and
discussing ways and means to meet it,
but we seldom hear of much progress
being made toward a solution. Yet,
rightly, whenever accountants meet you
find a lot of them complaining about
the legislatures monkeying about with
the Companies Acts, with the best in-
tentions in the world of improving
them but usually leaving them worse
than they were before. The accoun-
tants’ point is that they will find the
answers themselves in their own good
time, which they admit will be a pretty
long one, even yet.
Among those getting a bit impatient,
apparently, is the N.S.W. Registrar of
Companies, Mr. F. J. O. Ryan, who
is himself a barrister. He suggested
last week at a State conference of the
Australian Society of Accountants that
a statutory body should be set up to
establish a common basis for preparing
accounts. The trouble at present, he
said, was that accounts which pur-
ported to follow the phraseology of the
Companies Act and presented “a true
and fair view” of the financial position
of a company “can mean very much
what the directors and auditors want
them to mean” and not necessarily give
the correct picture. That opinion, from
the man who has probably looked at
more sets of accounts than most of us,
must be respected, even if in the eyes
of accountants generally his main idea
for hardening up the concept, natural
enough perhaps coming from a com-
pany registrar, will look rather too near
the bone.
For, as well as advocating setting up
a statutory body, Mr. Ryan would like
to see the “true and fair view” concept
replaced by the U.S. formula under
which auditors report that accounts
fairly present the financial position of
a company in conformity with “gener-
ally accepted accounting principles
applied on a basis consistent with that
of the precedent period.” Here the
trouble in adopting this was that we had
no identifiable code answering the des-
cription of “generally accepted account-
ing principles.” If he was wrong on this
and failing assurances from the profes-
sion on the p>oint, we should have the
suggested statutory body under the
Companies Act to lay down regulations
on the form and content of accounts
and the accounting principles to be
adopted in their preparation. Such a
body, he added, should include legal,
accountancy, and secretarial represen-
tation as well as government officials,
and its regulations would have to be
subject to review by Parliament. While
he thought this would give more flexi-
bility and certainty in the matter, it
would, he thought, also “facilitate the
process of development and evolution
of generally accepted accounting
principles.”
YES, BUT IF THE problems of formu-
lating an appropriate set of principles
are as real as accountants say they are
—and we must be prepared to accept
that —do we really want an arbitrary set,
which could conceivably put the pro-
fession in a straitjacket? Further, is it
quite consistent for Mr. Ryan to argue
that his solution would give at the same
time both flexibility and certainty in
the preparation of accounts? Flexibility
achieved at the cost of making the pro-
visions laid down by the statutory body
on the broadest basis could be at the
expense of certainty and vice versa.
There would seem to be presumption
that the accountancy bodies are pro-
crastinating in their own progress to-
ward a solution. If so, the thought of a
compulsory one being thrust upon them
could hurry them along, even get their
Sir Alex Fitzgerald ... principles
rival organisations working closer to-
gether than they have in the past, say
on the compulsory registration of
accountants.
There have, of course, been some
recent moves in the direction of co-
operative effort between the Australian
Society of Accountants and the Institute
of Chartered Accountants on the sub-
ject of accounting principles, with the
formation of a research organisation to
explore the subject and the two bodies
putting up $20,000 each for it. Further,
for some time they have been having
discussions on merging into one national
organisation of accountants. The new
research foundation, which is currently
seeking a full-time director, is barely
off the ground yet, having been in-
corporated (in Canberra). It has
already established an operations office
in Melbourne, with part-time staff, only
recently. Another move is that several
senior accountancy people are soon
to attend an international conference in
Paris which will discuss the possibility
of making uniform accounting prin-
ciples applicable on an international
basis.
What with Mr. Ryan laying govern-
ment intervention on the line, the ac-
countancy profession is not deriving as
much comfort as earlier expected when
the Attorneys-General decided to call
a halt to their drafting of a whole
heap of new amendments to the Com-
panies Acts (these are now in abeyance
pending a full-scale review of the Acts)
and to leave the next step on the com-
pany law front until the standing com-
mittee presided over by Mr. Justice
Eggleston reports on the extent of pro-
tection afforded investors by the uni-
form Companies Act and makes its
recommendations for changes (if any).
Nor is it only Mr. Ryan who has dis-
turbed their peace. In Brisbane, the
other day, we had one of the leaders in
the accountancy profession, Sir Thomas
Hiley, also advocating the establishment
of a standing Federal authority, which
would have the “unchallengeable right
of inquiry into alleged wrongdoing in
company matters.” .
We won’t go into that here. Ob-
viously the whole world of accountancy
is astir, which reminds me that there
have been several signs around lately
that the need for accountants could
be growing less. One was a blunt sort
of report from a company which stated
that according to its computer the re-
sults for the year were as follows . . .
Another was from Brisbane, where, tak-
ing the line that much of the future
work in accounting will be performed
by technicians rather than accountants,
the head of the accountancy department
at the University of Queensland, R. S.
Gynther, said the relative number of
qualified accountants fully employed in
business, governmental, and other
organisations will decline significantly
in the future. He envisages less and less
people taking accountancy courses,
which will tend to be done mainly by
those pursuing accountancy as a career
and not as a sibsidiary study.

Australia and Japan: special supplement
Discovery of a new Relationship
Largest Export Market For Australia
5TH JOINT MEETING
JAPAN AUSTRALIA BUSINESS CO-OPERATION COMMITTEE
The Prime Minister, Mr. Eisaku Sato, addressing the sth Joint Meeting of the
Japan-Australia Business Co-operation Committee, held in Tokyo in April, 1967
Australian products exhibition an
annual event at a Tokyo departmental
store
Australia is no longer a remote
country to Japan. The picture which
the average Japanese person has of Aus-
tralia is coming more into focus. House-
wives are familiar wdth the “made in
Australia” mark on packages of cheese,
mutton, and other food products; in
many a household TV scenes have
evoked dreams of a sightseeing trip to
Australia. Their country’s investments
in Australian minerals has awakened
real interest in the economy of Aus-
tralia. That Australia is, after the
United States, Japan’s largest trade
partner is becoming less and less a sur-
prise to the man in the street.
In Japan the financial year begins
on April 1, in Australia on July 1.
For the Australian-calculated financial
year 1965-66 Australian exports I to
Japan totalled $418.3 million, and im-
ports from Japan $249.2 million. In
the first half of 1966-67 (i.e., July
to December) the value of Australia’s
exports to Japan was $244.8 million,
and of her imports from Japan $127.3
million.
Japan was Australia’s second biggest
customer for many years (and biggest
customer for many individual items)
until the financial year which closed
on June 30. Year after year she was
reducing the margin between herself
and Britain, which had been the big-
gest customer previously, and by 1965-
66 this had narrowed to less than s3'
million. In 1966-67, Japan took the
lead—and besides passing Britain as
Australia’s largest customer became the

third largest exporter to Australia
(after the United States and Britain).
For Japan, the balance of trade
between the two countries remains a
serious problem, being almost two to
one against her. Nevertheless the
situation has improved since 1963,
when the odds were three to one.
The structure of trade between the
two countries has also changed. It
is certainly different from the original
pattern of almost eighty years ago,
when the principal Qf what is now the
Kanematsu-Gosho trading company
initiated regular trade between the
two countries. In those days Japan
began buying wool, rabbit-skins, beef,
and tallow from Australia, which in
exchange imported ceramics, bamboo-
ware, matches, and some green tea
from Japan. Today Japan is sending
industrial machinery, textiles, chemi-
cals, and motor vehicles to Australia;
and while still buying wool (for which
she has been biggest customer since
1959), Japan is today buying dairy
products, meat, wheat, and sugar as
well, in addition to coal, iron ore,
copper alloys, bauxite, and other
metals, chemicals, and even machinery
from Australia.
This drastic change in the volume and
diversity of the products exchanged by
the two countries would not have been
anticipated one decade ago, let alone
eight. Encouraged by the success of its
expansion, both countries are taking a
correspondingly keen interest in the de-
velopment of their mutual trade. Re-
cently department stores in various
parts of Japan have been holding ex-
hibitions in rapid succession (there have
been displays of Australian art at many
of these), and the number of Japanese
business visits to Australia has pro-
gressively increased. It has been exciting
for Japanese visitors to Australia to
observe the almost daily promotion of
Japanese motor vehicles in the Press
and on TV and radio.
Variety of
Products
and Mass
Consumption
For the foreigner making his first
visit to a Japanese departmental store
the chief surprise is the quantity of
goods on display, and particularly that
they include all types of brands of over-
seas products—wines and spirits, food-
stuffs, handicrafts, and so on. Such is
the abundance that he will find most
lines of his own country’s production
are available.
Japan brings in these consumer pro-
ducts to the detriment of her balance
of payments position, being an island
country dependent on the outside world
for most of the food and industrial
raw materials she needs. But give-and-
take is a Japanese trade tradition, and
as Japan sees it if she is to expand her
exports she must show some liberality
in her imports.
The goods brought in also minister
to the improved living standards of the
country, one measure of which is that
domestic ownership of cars has shown
an increase within one decade of 1118
per cent. To the benefit of the Aus-
tralian primary producer the improved
living standards are also reflected in
food and clothing.
Indeed, dietary habits have under-
gone a remarkable change. For instance,
because of the institution of a syste-
matic food distribution at primary
schools throughout Japan the daily
milk consumption of the children at-
tending these schools amounts to more
than 100,800 gallons. In the home
butter, cheese, bread, and fresh vege-
tables are replacing the traditional rice,
with a startling increase in the average
daily intake of calories.
In these circumstances it is no
wonder that Japan has become the
largest importer of Australian cheese.
For the six months up to last Decem-
ber Japan took 33 percent of Australia’s
total cheese exports —3900 tons of it, in
comparison with 1600 taken by Britain.
There has been a steady growth also in
Japan’s imports of butter and skim
milk, also of meat.
Foodstuffs have thus been added to
clothing as the reason for Japan’s ever
mounting imports from Australia.
Clothing imports generally have risen
by 106 percent over the past ten years.
The Japanese describe this westernis-
ing process in habits of food and cloth-
ing, this qualitative improvement and
diversification of consumer products
(and the parallel development of dis-
tribution systems) as the “new revolu-
tion in consumption.” It means that
Japan has entered an entirely new
phase in the nature of her consumer
economy, the most important factor
of the national economy.
The inevitable side-effect is that, like
western countries, Japan has begun to
suffer from the cost inflation which
wage increases have brought about.
Ten years ago talk of a labor shortage
was rather hypothetical. It is now a
practical problem, and a serious one, at
all levels of business. Income of the
average worker increased by 33 percent
in the five years up to 1960, and by
62 percent in the succeeding five years.
In the same decade, the income of the
average urban dweller rose 2.4 times,
and of the rural dweller two times.
A middle class has evolved in Japan
with a growth in the economy sup-
ported by these increases in personal
income. Television is in 96 percent of
households, washing machines are in
81 percent of them, and refrigerators
in 77 percent. A series of allied in-
dustries has been stimulated by demands
for new products to replace the old.
With the changed structure of
demand, producers have redoubled
their efforts to supply the new pro-
ducts in bigger quantities and at lower
prices. Simultaneously, under the
Government’s liberalisation policy
already 93 percent of all import items
have been put on a free trade basis.
Tust 22 years from the end of World
War 11, which devastated her pro-
duction and commerce, Japan is a
highly industrialised nation with an
open economy.


Continuous Growth of Japanese Economy
Unprecedented
Growth and
Capital
Investment
In its May and June issues The
Economist published a survey of Japan
entitled “The Risen Sun.” The writer
said that the keys to the rapid economic
growth of Japan included the high
level of education, liberal capital in-
vestment, abundant labour, a flexible
banking and credit system, group
loyalties, capable Government officials,
and well-organised planning.
Inside looking out, it is difficult for
the Japanese themselves to put a finger
on what could have been the potent
factors, but it is evident that one of
these has been an amazing and con-
tinuous expansion of capital invest-
ment in the private sector.
Consider the ratio of corporate capi-
tal investment to gross national product
as a measure of the volume of such
investment: this ratio climbed steadily
from 11.5 percent in 1951-55 to 18.9
percent in 1958-61, and 20.5 percent
in 1962-64; this heavy capital invest-
ment has increased a huge domestic
demand. As one economist has put it,
“investment breeds investment.”
Its rationalisation effect has been
another great benefit.
For example, in manufacturing the
volume of capital stock per worker
rose in 1955-64 at an average annual
rate of 7.3 percent, the world’s highest
ratio.
The fact that it has eased the change
in the nation’s industrial structure
should not be overlooked in discussing
the role played by such brisk capital
investment.
Statistics compiled by the Economic
Planning Agency (a Government body)
disclose that, in 1955, light industry
products such as fabrics, toys, and
handicrafts represented 57 percent of
Japan’s total exports; products of cot-
tage industries accounted for 18 per-
cent. In 1965 the proportion of light
industry exports had declined to 34
percent, giving way to iron and steel,
machinery, chemicals, and other heavy
industry products which accounted for
the remaining 66 percent of exports.
The highly processed products of heavy
industry showed a particularly sharp in-
crease: in the past ten years machinery
Marunouchi, Tokyo—the business centre of Japan
exports have grown at an average 27
percent annually. Truly a marked
structural change in the national
economy is reflected in this transforma-
tion of the export picture.
In the meantime, the demand for im-
ported raw materials and machinery
required for this increased production
has also grown rapidly. The rate of in-
crease in such imports has been much
in excess of the world average. From
1950 to 1965 they increased at an aver-
age annual rate of 12.4 percent, the
world figure being 6.3 percent. The
composition of the imports should be
noted—they included machinery needed
by Japan to catch up with the progress
of industrial techniques in other coun-
tries, and food and other consumer
goods needed to meet the demands of
the increased domestic living standards.
There has been a particularly marked
increase in the fuels and raw materials
needed for heavy industries. It is true
that some of the remarkable improve-
ment in productivity was due to tech-
nical innovations and the enlarged scale
of production. But with Japan’s scar-
city of natural resources it would re-
quire more than the rationalisation
brought about by improved productivity
t 0 slow down the intake from abroad,
There has been a five percent reduction
over the past six years in the quantity
of imported raw materials needed for
production; but the proportion to the
combined total of domestic and lm-
ported raw materials has risen by ten
percent.
Manufacturers believe that increased
imports can be financed by export of
the products made from them, although
undoubtedly it will be necessary to con-
tinue efforts to improve productivity,
This accounts for Japan’s early liberal-
isation of import trade. The “open
economy” is aimed at a more expansive
specialisation in the world economy.


The "Catch-Up"
Period and the
Technological
Production
Today Japan supports her large-scale
production with a high technical level
that is self-attained. Japan is the world’s
No. 1 producer of ships, motor-cycles,
cameras, watches, TV sets, No. 2 pro-
ducer of motor vehicles, and No. 3 pro-
ducer of steel. Japan has emerged from
its “catch-up” phase, when the dire
necessity was -to rise from the ashes and
put Japan’s techniques on a level with
the postwar techniques of the rest of
the world.
Until she evolved her own, Japan
had to import foreign techniques to
produce the durable consumer goods
which the West had begun to use in
prewar days—vacuum cleaners, re-
frigerators, washing machines, air-
conditioners; her second wave of tech-
nical innovations embraced products
that had not existed in prewar times —
transistor radios, TV sets, tape re-
corders, electronic computers, plastics.
In addition to the consumer products
there appeared the electronically auto-
mated plants and strip mills and the
combination system seen in the petro-
chemical industries. Manufacturing pro-
cesses were first modernised, and de-
velopment of new products followed.
The post-war economy of Japan has
been one of continuous experiment.
In a labor productivity for manufac-
turing which grew at an average annual
rate of 9.4 percent in the 1955-66 period,
mechanisation accounted for 5.2 per-
cent was attributable to increase of capi-
tal investment per worker and the re-
maining 4.2 percent to other factors.
It is some time since Japan finally
“caught up.” In each branch of in-
dustry, independent development of
techniques is now bearing fruit. It
is true Japan was not the first country
to develop nylon, to build mammoth
tankers, to make microtelevision sets
and FM receivers; but she greatly im-
proved the techniques; some of those
imported were later exported to foreign
countries.
Aiding the evolvement of high tech-
niques and their use in mass produc-
tion have been two significant factors—
a domestic market which has grown to
over 100 million people, and the
quality of Japanese labor, a vital ele-
ment of which is the high level of edu-
cation. This factor alone
meant swift assimilation of the most
advanced techniques, whatever their
origin. Also, top management in Japan
is never afraid to apply new techniques
to manufacturing processes. While the
quality of labor is high the quantity is
diminishing, and, anticipating both
labor shortages .and intensified inter-
national competition, there has been
YS-11 turboprop passenger plane manufactured by Nihon Aeroplane Manu-
facturing Co. Ltd.
a rapid and widespread adoption of
automation and new production sys-
tems; for example, the strip mills of
the steel industry, the conveyor system
in production of motor vehicles, and
sophisticated equipment for fertilisers,
petrochemicals, and for oil refining.
These have improved and increased
production and lowered its costs, and
at the same time augmented the
quality of the machinery for doing this.
The progressiveness of top manage-
ment was thus an important element in
the growth of the national economy.
The new industrial set-up in Japan
has provided the right climate for
solving the problem that confronted
the economy in the evolvement of its
own techniques. The challenge has been
taken up successfully. Japan’s research
and development investment is still not
equal to that of western countries con-
sidered in proportion to total national
expenditure. Yet in the number of
theses submitted to universities and
equivalent institutions Japan ranks
second. She has a great potential in
the field of basic research, she has
many gifted researchers, and in applied
techniques ranks indeed highly. The
evidence of that is the success of the
improvements evolved by such tech-
niques. The Government is placing em-
phasis on the development of tech-
niques which can be applied to industry,
and these are being developed as a
major national project, in co-operation
with private enterprise. The effective-
ness of this is demonstrated in a
marked gtowth in the export to foreign
countries of the techniques thus pro-
duced.


Internationalizing of Industries
Getting under way on July 1 last,
the foreign investment liberalisation
program marked the beginning of a
new era for the Japanese economy and
brought top management up against the
most difficult situation it has faced
since World War 11. The entry of
foreign firms into Japan’s food and
pharrrfaceutical industries is now full-
scale. Although foreign nationals are
not yet able to invest freely in these,
the electronic, petrochemical, and
automotive industries have deemed it
prudent to engage in some serious study
of the nature of such foreign invest-
ment as they will undoubtedly en-
counter.
At first the general attitude of in-
dustrialists was cautious. They feared
that foreign investment might deal a
serious blow at the structure of in-
dustry. Now, on the contrary, their pre-
occupation is with ways and means of
adjusting as quickly as possible to what
they accept as the new age of inter-
nationalism.
On April 1 last Japan inaugurated
her new financial year by joining the
“Article 8 status” nations of IMF. She
followed this on April 28 by becoming a
member of OECD. This coincided with
a braking of the previously sharp econ-
omic growth in the economy and tended
to stabilise the economic structure of the
nation. Her international situation re-
mained by the fact that she was still in
the midst of the liberalisation of her
economy.
The situation revealed that Japanese
industry, which had succeeded in im-
proving its capital structure and in
catching up to world levels, had made
a positive response to the challenges of
foreign trade and of capital liberalisa-
tion based on the free trade principle,
And the Government, adopting what
is called a policy “mix”—a combina-
tion of fiscal and financial measures—
is calling for “sustained growth.”

JAPAN'S
QUEST
FOR
QUALITY
To earn and maintain this reputation
for quality, Japanese industrialists
and government officials have been
working in close co-operation for
many years.
Mass production techniques are
consistent with high quality output
when the principles of scientific
quality control are effectively imple-
mented. Through the years, methods
have been developed which have
pointed the way to maximum quality
at minimum cost. This is made pos-
sible by mathematical procedures that
determine exactly how, and how
often, the product is subjected to
inspection on its journey through the
manufacturing plant. Japanese
engineers have made original contri-
butions to the advancement of statis-
tical quality control techniques, basing
their approach on American methods
imported by Japan.
Recognising the necessity for a far-
reaching system of quality control as
a basic adjunct to a progressive
industrial society, the Japanese Gov-
ernment has provided a needed incen-
tive in its industrial Standardisation
Law.
Under the present provisions of this
law, Japanese manufacturers may
request Government inspection of
quality control programs. Official
inspectors examine plant facilities,
company operations, and personnel.
Those manufacturers whose overall
organisations meet stringent specifi-
cations may earn the Japan Indus-
trial Standard (J. 1.5.) rating for their
merchandise.
An added incentive is provided by
the Japan Institute of Science and
Technology, which each year awards
prizes to' those establishments prac-
tising the most advanced quality con-
trol techniques. This prize for excel-
lence in quality control is named for
Dr. W. Edwards Deming, the Ameri-
can pioneer who explored the modern
development of quality control as a
science.
Yet quality control has been suc-
cessful in Japan—not because of laws
or prizes—but because it is inherent
in an industrial philosophy which has
developed during the past fifteen
years. As a result of this philosophy,
benefits flow to all parties—the pro-
ducer of raw materials, the manu-
facturer of finished goods, the ex-
porter, the importer, and the ultimate
consumer.
Thus mathematics, which knows no
language barrier, together with a
philosophy of quality that is truly
ingrained in all branches of Japanese
industry have combined forces to
create a new and hard-won reputa-
tion for the products of Japan.
The ability of Japanese industry to
produce consumer and industry goods
of predictably high quality continues
to improve as the science of quality
control continues to grow throughout
the world.

Representative
of Japanese
Economy
It is characteristic of the making of
industrial machines that the products
are in demand from an extremely wide
variety of users, in Japan as else-
where. Hence there has been a close
connection between the growth of the
industry and capital investment in the
private sector. In Japan, Government
agencies and public bodies together
account for no more than ten per-
cent of the total domestic demand for
industrial machinery. In order of im-
portance, bulk of the output is absorbed
by (1) exports (2) the power industry
(3) the chemical industry (4) the iron
and steel industry (5) the construction
industry and (6) the machine industry.
Brisk activity of the industrial
machinery business in 1966 and 1967
has reflected faithfully on upsurge in
the national economy. In its measures
to end a recession that had extended
over many years the Government late
last year issued bonds for the first time
since the war days, receipts being
appropriated for an expansion of pub-
lic works designed to stimulate domestic
demand. As a result, there was a con-
spicuous increase in the demand for
construction machinery. In 1966 pro-
duction of this exceeded the previous
year’s level by as much as 40 percent.
The increased production of industrial
machinery as a whole being 21 per-
cent, this advance in the production
of construction machinery is truly im-
pressive. Vigorous capital investment
also resulted from the new Govern-
ment policy, and this in turn increased
demand in all industrial machinery
fields over the 1965 figures—46 per-
cent for plastic moulding machines;
29 percent for power transmission; 20
percent for pneumatic and hydraulic

veyance machines.
With the expansion of capital in-
vestment came a rapid increase in
industrial machinery orders from the
iron and steel, automotive and chemical
industries. Metal-working machine
manufacturers in particular were
deluged with orders for rolling mills
from the iron and steel industry and
for forging presses from the automo-
tive industry. Total 1966 orders for
metal-working machines were 2.2 times
higher than in 1965.
There is now world-wide recognition
that Japan excels in the production of
mining machines, and there has been a
steady demand for these—particularly
rock drills and crushers. The industry
takes special pride in the world stan-
dard of its rock drills for long holes,
drill jambos, concrete breakers, boring
machines, and crushers, and in the
pumps, blowers, and other pneumatic
and hydraulic machines for which its
reputation goes back to pre-war days.
The industry had a well-advanced pre-
war output of high temperature, high
pressure pumps, and, overcoming the
post-war technical vacuum rapidly,
long ago re-established its reputation
in the world pump industry.
Equally well established is Japan’s
reputation for the high quality of cranes
and other conveyance machines. But
the industry has never succumbed to
the temptation to rest on its laurels.
Its restless quest of greater and greater
efficiency has been richly rewarded by
the amazing growth in overseas de-
mands for its output of bulldozers and
power shovels. Although Japan had to

has been a notable rise also in the
overseas demand for rolling mills and

durability, economy of operation, and
full after-care service.

Change Of Industrial Machine Production


Technical
Progress
Parallel
to Demand
The fact that so many industrial
machines are made to order to meet
the specific requirements of individual
users has a lot to do with the close
connection (referred to earlier) between
the demand for industrial machinery
and activity in every field of industry,
capital investment in particular. For
its own growth and its own modernisa-
tion every branch of industry wants
machinery, and wants the best. Thus,
to satisfy each new and exacting speci-
fication, necessarily there has to be an
increasing progression in improvements
of this industrial machinery. The strik-
ing evdence that it is meeting all the
demands made upon it is that these
persisting technical innovations are such
an important factor of Japan’s economic
growth.
There is an illustration of the close
relationship between makers and users
of industrial machinery in the develop-
ment in processes of manufacturing
crushers. The crusher developed origin-
ally as an ore-dressing machine; but
Japan’s deficiency in natural resources
called for an effort to extract high
grade ores with maximum efficiency
and economy. Therefore, manufactur-
ers and users co-operated in improving
crushers to the point where they
could meet newer and more compli-
cated purposes.
It is this constant pressure for higher-
type production which explains why
Rolling machine made by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries Co. Ltd.
Japanese crushers were able not only
to match international standards at an
early stage but also to be used in other
industries besides mining including
the cement, the iron and steel, and
the chemical industries. The enhance-
ment of crusher techniques owes much
to the amazing growth and rationalisa-
tion of Japanese industry as a whole,
and the superb performance resulting
from these techniques has won the
respect of the mining world.
The rising technical level of Japan’s
industrial machinery has contributed
greatly to her achievements as the
world’s third greatest producer of iron
and steel. This year the domestic de-
mand alone for iron and steel is ex-
pected to exceed 60 million tons. For
some time after the end of World War
II the iron and steel industry had to
rely largely on imports for its tech-
nical installations. Now local manu-
facturers of industrial machinery meet
the industry’s demands. Local manu-
facturers have embarked on producing
rolling mills to the specifications of the
steelmakers, who are continuously
studying designs for better, cost-saving
productions in this field.
No longer do the steel men import
their blooming mills, including the
four-plate rolling mills. The plate mills
being installed these days are Japanese
without exception; so, too, are the hot
and cold strip mills, regarded as per-
haps the greatest post-war technical
innovation in the iron and steel in-
dustry.
The manufacture of tandem mills
has been going on since 1963—mills
running at such terrific speed, and call-
ing for such delicate adjustment of their
balance with the motors, that produc-
tion would be impossible without years
of experience and maximum technical
knowledge on the part of the manu-
facturer. This has been a brilliant
achievement, and again owes much to
the exchange of information amongst
users, makers, and appliance manu-
facturers. In this production of in-
dustrial machinery are crystallised all
the capabilities and potential of Japan-
ese industrialists.
Competitive
Power
From the foregoing it will be seen
that no section of Japanese industry is
better equipped to meet new demands
than the manufacturers of industrial
machinery. Newest developments, for
domestic and export needs, include
power shovels of 4.6 cubic metres
capacity, and a boring machine for
depths of 9750 feet. Other large-scale
productions under way are high-speed-
large-capacity compressors, and large
main-shaft hoists, and high-speed rolling
mills.
The aim of Japanese industrial
machinery manufacturers is to gear the
industry for exports at the rate of 20
percent of annual production, and there
are many encouraging indications that
the industry will succeed in this. Al-
ready exports are increasing. Exports
moreover include the exporting of
techniques (such as those of technical
injection moulding machines and over-
head travelling cranes). Fields in
which Japanese manufactures are hold-
ing world interest include plants which
certainly proclaim the overall techni-
cal capability of the makers, such as a

Japanese industrial firms) have won a
reputation for their keen regard for
quick service, including after-sale ser-
vice. The makers of Japanese indus-
trial machinery, and those in the allied
industries of Japan, are also making
industrial history; and in this there
are exciting chapters still to come.

Some rights
from the
bull market
I WONDER WHEN the new Austra-
lian Resources Development Bank that
we have heard so much about will get
going and what it will do? So far the
only news flashes are that it will have
a paid capital of $3 million (chipped
in equally by the eight major trading
banks); it will borrow funds from locals
and foreigners; its board will be com-
prised of the general managers of the
banks that put up the capital (that
figures); and its head office will be
in (leaving Sydney with
the Opera House and St. George
Leagues Club). Information on what
the bank is actually going to do is still
rather general. It is supposed to be
financing the extracting, processing, and
transportation of raw materials. In view
of the fact that any deal concerning
the abovementioned is likely to be a
big one, I wonder if the new bank
'will be like the one described by
Ogden Nash when he said:
Most bankers dwell in marble halls,
In which they get to dwell because
They encourage deposits and discourage
withdrawls,
And particularly because they observe
one rule,
Which woe betide the banker who fails
to heed it,
Which is, you must never lend any
money
To anybody, unless they don’t need it.
Actually, talking of banks, they all
seem to be doing rather well at the
moment. Most of their prices are at, or
near, the year’s peak and all look like
going higher. On the basis that a bull
market is a good place to buy rights,
and on the basis that prices of most
recent rights issues have been rather
up and down (good for speculators),
I decided to buy 400 Commercial Bank
of Sydney rights. Actually, by getting
them at $1.55 I got them 5 cents below
what their high price had already been
and which I expect will be again.
Another company I’m banking on
this week is Hilton Corporation, the
clothing people. This company is well
known for its stockings, socks, lingerie,
and swimming gear. Investors, however,
know it for another reason. They
remember Hilton as the company that
diversified and lost. This is how it
happened. Back in 1958 Hilton decided
that as it was doing so well out of
clothing it might as well turn its
talents to another industry as well. So
it did. It bought a drop-forging com-
pany. Unfortunately for Hilton, the out-
come of the move wasn’t quite what
it expected. The drop-forging com-
pany lost money and Hilton lost its
market appeal. However, after per-
severing with red figures in the trading
account of the drop-forging company
for a few years, Hilton decided to drop
it and sell out. That was in 1963. Since
then everything has been coming up
roses. Profits have increased yearly and
so has the earning rate.
Last year the company once again
turned in record figures. Its profit went
up from $772,359 to $823,715 and its
fearning rate reached 38.6 percent com-
pared to 36.1 percent in 1965/66. More-
over, the increased profit was achieved
after an increase in tax of $223,600
(because there were no more tax losses
left). I was impressed. Any company
that can turn in this sort of perform-
ance and still yield 7 percent is all
right with me. I bought 350. I must
also admit that I was influenced by
the possibility of this company making
some sort of issue in the not-too-distant
future. With its dividend rate at 15
percent, being more than 2.5 times
covered by earnings and the bank over-
draft being $1,941,560, whereas it was
only $760,587 the year before, I felt
that the settings looked rather ripe for
some sort of action. Action like a cash
issue to shareholders, for instance.
Another company where share-
holders should fare well is Grace Bros.
During the year just ended (which was
July 31 for G. 8.), the company did
very well. Profits went up by 13 percent
to a record $2,115,307. In addition to
this, the dividend, which had been 12£
percent for the three preceding years,
was kicked up to 13£ percent by a final
payment of 7 percent. And my guess
is that the current year’s shareholders
will receive 7 percent dividend cheques
for both their interim and final pay-
ments. Grace Bros, in my books is one
of the best term investments in the
retailing industry.

WILD CAT PAGES
What hopes among industrials?
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
HAS THE MARKET gone high
enough? There is no doubt that the
leaders look pretty high, with the aver-
age weighted yield from the Melbourne
50 leaders’ index having been sliced
from almost 4 percent a year ago to
2.86 percent for September. And even
if the impact of BHP is taken out of this
by using the unweighted index, there has
still been a substantial (if not so
dramatic) fall in yields from 5.46 per-
cent last September to 4.78 percent.
But it is wrong to make too much
of this; the weighted index is far too
heavily affected by the moves of oil-
seeker BHP to be regarded as any sort
of indicator of expectations in the indus-
trial sector. And an interesting exercise
by lan Potter and Co. in a circular to
clients shows that if reasonable expec-
tations of profit rises by the 50 leaders
are accomplished in the next two or
three years, then the average weighted
earnings yield would rise from its
present 4.79 percent (below bond rate!)
to a historically acceptable 6.28 percent,
(The assumptions Potters make are that
BHP and CSR earning rates should rise
50 percent, Mt. Isa’s should be restored
to 80 percent; CRA’s should be doubled,
and all the rest should go up 15 per-
cent.)
The firm still takes the view that
because it will take two or three years
to get to this situation, the market has
to wait until then before present prices
are justified. And it wonders to what
extent Australian share prices are being
sustained by London buying in the fear
of a devaluation of sterling, with Aus-
tralian dollars not moving the whole
way. So it is going a bit easy on the
market, saying “We would be wary of
predicting any further general share
price advance at present. Shares should
still be bought, but only on the basis
of their particular earnings potential,
be it based on nickel, oil, or color
television.”
But there are many stocks that are
far from overpriced in the market at
present, no matter how high the leaders
may be. Many good quality stocks are
still well below their levels of 1964, and
have better prospects now than they
did then. The Sydney broking house
of Old Minnett, T. J. Thompson, and
Partners has issued its clients with a
list of 60 stocks, all but three of which
are industrials, as it says the mining
market has tended to distract attention
from them. The list is heavily oriented
toward consumer goods, with five
breweries, the two listed vintners, two
food stocks (and British Tobacco as
well), Schweppes for soft drinks, a
restaurateur (Cahills), two retailers
(Myers and Lowes), and the two chain-
stores, four newspaper stocks, and eight
radio and television companies.
The banks it recommends are the
Wales, CBC, and National; the finance
companies are Associated Securities,
AGO and Custom Credit; the building
and construction stocks are BMI, A. J.
Chown, James Hardie, A. V. Jennings,
Paynter and Dixon, and T. C. Whittle;
its natural resources stocks are BHP,
CSR, and Thiess.
Other stocks include Burns Philp,
Ansett, Mayne Nickless, Larke, Optical
Industries, Dalgety’s and Elders, Repco,
Australian Controls, EMI, Queensland
Insurance and Bankers and Traders,
Lend Lease, M. B. John and J. Kohler,
Brownbuilt, G. E. Crane, Sebels, Union
Carbide, A. G. Sims, ACI, Bonds, and
Allied Mills.
THE NATURAL RESOURCES stocks
are still the centre of the stage, so the
question of how to judge the “right”
price for them is of vital interest. The
Brisbane broking house of Corrie and
Co. has had a crack at formalising a
technique for doing so. The fact that
in one or two instances the conclusions
the firm has drawn from these tech-
niques have already been shown to be
quite wrong does not discredit the
techniques themselves. But in an area
of such immense uncertainty, and with
so many “unknowns,” formal techniques
have a value that should not be over-
stated.
Nevertheless, they are useful. The
Corrie system is to work out the profit
that major natural resources stocks
would have to earn over the next 17£
years to justify present prices on two
alternative bases—firstly on the basis
of a 50 percent “discount factor” and
secondly on a 25 percent discount factor.
This means that, on the first basis, the
company must earn over the next 17J
years twice as much per share as the
shares now cost; on the second, they
must earn one-third more.
Corrie then examines the prospective
The Chartist says:
ERIC ANDERSON CONSOLIDATED could be an interesting recovery situation
on technical grounds. The long-term trend since 1962 must be a depressing sight
to those investors who bought in above the 60c level. A clear selling signal would
have been indicated on the charts about September, 1963, after which the stock
finally fell to a low point of Bc. The major downtrend was broken early 1966
with the rise of 17c, but prices again receded to form a base above the 8c
level. Trading has taken place between 13c and 17c for the major part of this year
and, if prices move above 18c in the short term on high volume, an eventual
recovery to. approximately the 50c level could be expected. Last sale price on

Roll forged twist drills cost no more, yet are so superior in performance,
that the cost savings they make possible in your production programme
can mean all the difference between your obtaining full profit margins or
just getting-by! Is this a problem you’re facing? You’ll find that twist
drills made by the roll forging process have superior, heavy-cutting
ability, provide increased drilling rates well in excess of B.S. requirements,
and possess a hard, burnished surface-finish that ensures longer life and
fewer re-sharpens. Up to twice as many holes per drill! All this because
as the result of the roll forging drill-manufacturing process, the granular
structure of the high speed steel used, follows the contour of the cutting

sources of income for these development
stocks and sees how close they come to
these “targets.” Those that he thinks
can exceed these targets are classified
A; those that he thinks can probably
achieve them he classifies B, and those
that he thinks will fail to do so are
classified C.
Only four of the 15 stocks he analyses
receive an A rating on the first basis of
being likely to earn more than double
the current price per share over the
next 174 years. These are BHP, King
Island Scheelite, Mt. Isa Mines, and
Peko-Wallsend (although this may be
affected by the Mt. Morgan offer). He
thinks another five may be able to
achieve the doubling rate, and these are
Broken Hill South, EZ Industries,
Flamersley, North Broken Hill, and
Renison.
Three of those he expects to fall
behind the target, CRA, New Broken
Hill, and Western Mining Corporation,
should nevertheless do better than the
one-third rise of his second criterion.
Another two stocks, Mt. Lyell and Mt.
Morgan, he lists as failing "the first
objective but likely to achieve the
second. And he thinks that Consolidated
Goldfields will fail on both counts.
He therefore urges a switch from
all the other stocks into his A class
companies, and particularly from Mt.
Lyell, Mt. Morgan, and Consolidated
Goldfields. Frankly, the idea of doing
this does not appeal to me at all and
I would need more convincing that the
Corrie information was soundly based.
There is no doubt that it is useful
to make this sort of comparison on the
basis of the known information avail-
able about these stocks. The trouble is
in working out just what the “known
information” really is. For example,
Corrie simply did not know, when
working out his Consolidated Gold-
field’s “failure,” that the group’s profit
from iron ore was far greater than
Corrie had expected. Last week’s
annual report indicates, for example,
that the Mount Goldsworthy iron ore
project could earn $7 million (Corrie
had estimated $4.7 million) and there
seems a fair chance Consolidated
Goldfields could receive about $2.3
million of that, instead of Corrie’s
estimated dividend from this source
of $1 million a year for the next
17-|- years. Since Corrie lists Consoli-
dated Goldfields’ “normal profit ex-
pectation” as only $3.1 million (which
looks a bit silly even apart from the
iron ore mistake), the situation in
iron ore (a possible extra $1.3 million
a year on top of his estimate) changes
the whole analysis.
THE MARKET HAS not been terribly
impressed by last week’s annual
accounts from Waltons Ltd., despite the
generally improved state of the retail
trade and despite directors’ confidence
that the “substantial improvements in
sales and profits” they expect in the
future will begin to show in the current
year in increased profit and earning
rates. But the share price is still down at
around 81 cents to give a very high
yield of 7.7 percent on dividends and
10.6 percent on earnings.
True, the company’s 17 percent
profit rise was due only to tax conces-
sions following its purchase of the
Marcus Clark group; pre-tax profit had
in fact fallen by nine percent. But
when the cost of acquiring these losses
is taken into account, the latest profit
is fairly good. And the earning rate
of 17.3 percent gives adequate cover
to the 127 r percent dividend not a
bad achievement after the $3 million
note conversion added almost 20 per-
cent to capital.
The market’s main concern seems
with the balance sheet. The unexplained
50 percent increase in trading stock
from $lO million to $l5 million is strik-
ing; it may be explained largely by the
Marcus Clark takeover, but, if so, it
reflects a different way of doing busi-
ness from Waltons’ traditional one. And
it has meant that the company’s ratio
of profits to stocks has fallen sharply
from 27.6 percent to 21.6 percent.
The market could well be a little
disturbed by the fact that Waltons’
borrowings have risen by about one
third, and now total $21.2 million
apart from a $4.5 million overdraft
(up $2.4 million during the year). For
this has meant that the group faces
the redemption of $25.6 million in
debt within the next two years, but it
only has $22.2 million in debts due
to it in this period. There should not
be much of a problem in refinancing
this, and the $3.4 million gap could
easily be met from cash flow. But it
represents a changed situation from
the previous year when the company
had a 50 percent debt redemption
cover. The company has put most
of this extra cash into properties
(largely due to the takeover) which
have risen by $7 million to $23.4 mil-
lion, and stock (up $5 million).
The company appears to have
adopted a new system of classifying
accounts receivable, for its net total
of receivables has dropped by $1 mil-
lion to $19.3 million, but its “cus-
tomers’ accounts receivable” have
jumped by s4| million, or one third
to $18.7 million. This has been offset
by a fall of almost $4 million in
“other accounts receivable.” It is
aggravating that the company does
not show its bad debts provision; it
reveals only the million provision
it inherited from Marcus Clark (and
which it says is in excess of require-
ments.
Waltons’ new links with First
National City Bank should help it con-
siderably, but the latest accounts sug-
gest that the company still has some
problems to overcome before everything
is plain sailing. It should do better
this year, but there is a chance that it
mav not do very much better.

The Melbourne market
Share yields and
interest rates
SIR lAN POTTER had a good look
at the boom in mining shares when
addressing the Australian United In-
vestment meeting in Melbourne this
week and came up with the
unequivocal answer that the longer-
term prospects for the leading com-
panies mainly involved in it would
justify the current market prices for
their shares. The basic difference be-
tween this and past mining' booms, in
his opinion, was in the quality of the
companies concerned. The leading
Australian and international companies
in the present boom are immensely
strong and of proven capacity.
Sir lan drew assurances for the in-
dustrials market from this. Already
industrials have benefited from the re-
investment of profits made in the
mining market and, with the prices in
the latter well justified by the, pros-
pects for the companies, he was look-
ing for more succor for industrials
from such reinvestment. To back his
judgment on mining shares Australian
United has not been selling any of its
considerable holding.
Well and good, but even if one can
accept the line that mining is going
to help industrials and also that with
a good, possibly a bumper, year ahead
for industrial company profits, indus-
trials will come more into vogue on a
second score, what Mr. E. P. Harty,
managing director of Australian United
Corporation, says about interest rates
in a paper prepared for the Chartered
Accountants research society has to
be considered. Mr. Harty talks about
interest rates being stuck at too high a
level by the petard of the 30/20 rule,
that rates are far too rigid, and in the
past two years have become relatively
dearer on an international compari-
son. The point is that, while interest
rates are stuck at these high levels,
the scope for rises in industrial shares
will remain limited on yield basis
considerations.
ALTHOUGH THEY’D BEEN sit-
ting up to no mean effect during the
week at a shade over 1500, BHP
shares, which provided most of the
market excitement after the news of
hydrocarbons (a euphemism for you
know what) in the Dolphin well, tended
to sit down a bit when their erstwhile
patron Mr. Shepherd got off the boat
he’d come home on from Britain on
Friday afternoon. Mr. Shepherd, who
says he’s about $3.2m. richer in BHP
terms since he went away six months
ago, reckons the shares are worth
not less than $lO to $l3 apiece on their
steel assets, activities and potential,
without throwing in anything for the
oil and gas and whatnot (there’s plenty

of whatnot, too, as the announcement
during the week that the company is
going to search for tin in Indonesia
attests).
EVEN IF MYER stole more limelight
during the week and got up to 427,
its highest for the year on Friday, as
all the good things in the results were
further discounted, at least some
investors have been sparing a thought
for the smaller lights in Melbourne’s
retailing world. Both Ball and Welch
and The Leviathan came under notice
on remarks at their annual meetings
during the week filling in the back-
ground to very successful years and
indicating a continuance of the good
work.
For investors who like to go shopping
around and even switching their pur-
chases from one store to another, it is
obvious that The Leviathan, with a
yiqld of 6 percent on shares covered
1.6 times, is a cheaper proposition than
Ball and Welch, with 1.1 times cover
and a yield of 5.5 percent —the more
so perhaps because last year The
Leviathan posted a record profit in its
115 years’ life on Bourke Street, where
the shopping traffic is much thicker
than in Flinders Street. Admittedly
there are now good prospects of its
thickening up on the latter pavements
now that the Gas and Fuel Corpora-
tion have moved in to the Princes Gate
palace. It is also worth a passing
thought that although The Leviathan
can’t compare with Myer in size, it
could well do so in percentage growth
potential, of which Myer seems to be
discounting a lot of in its 2.4 percent
yield basis for a share whose latest
dividend (20 percent) was only 1.4
times covered by earnings.
ALTHOUGH THE $1 SHARES of
Tasmanian cement producer Goliath
Holdings are a pretty dull market in
both Melbourne and Sydney (where
this might be the more understandable)
at 180 and entry via the rights (now
around 85, with a dividend difference
of 6.5 cents) no cheaper, they could
look a much better proposition once
the new issue is out of the way. There
are also the good things mentioned at
last week’s meeting, like the cutting of
costs, and the extra output from the
new kiln and the further one being
considered by the company to come
along. The build-up of prior charges
to finance new plant looks rather
heavy at this stage and the new issue
to replenish drawn-down liquidity is
another block to the progress of the
share price. But the chairman, Mr.
S. S. Purves, was most optimistic about
expanding business, especially inter-
state. Not a murmur about trouble in
getting cement into N.S.W.; on the
contrary, news about the erection of
handling facilities in Melbourne and
Sydney by RMC to expedite interstate
trade in Goliath’s cement.


TV recall
test.
rsV/o j
\
How many commercials can you
remember from k half hour
TV programme? Five? Ten? Fifteen?
It’s vital for all advertisers to know the potential recall of commercials
but until last week nobody knew for sure. So GTV9 and TCN9
commissioned Audience Studies Inc., a leading international research
organisation, to study TV commercial effectiveness. They showed
similarly matched audiences a current TV programme changing
the number of commercials in the programme each time.
The results proved a hunch we’4 had for years. If your commercial
is screened along with 13 others, as compared to being one of only 8,
then your chance of recall drops 53%. GTV9 and TCN9 guarantee
you greater recall because we never run more than 9 minutes of
commercials in any prime time hour although the Australian
Broadcasting Control Board allows 11 minutes.

Fibres in paper, micro-organisms in soil, the cellular structure of trees.
This is the world of the incredibly small that A.P.M. scientists are
investigating every day.
In the 1920’s Australian scientists set out to find a method of making
paper from Australian eucalypts. These methods are the basis of our
industry today and the pulping of hardwoods is now well established
in all paper-making countries.
The research being done today in A.P.M. laboratories will pay off in

Behind, the balance sheets
There’s health in McPhersons
THE MARKET DOES NOT like most
of the changes that have taken place at
McPhersons Ltd., the former “blue
chip” whose share price has fallen 45
percent in the last three years and is
now down to its lowest for more than
a decade, whose profits have fallen for
the second year in a row, and whose
management structure has been reorgan-
ised. But in pricing the shares at only
$2.75 to yield 6 percent on income
and 9.9 percent on earnings, the market
seems to be taking an unduly pessimistic
view. Despite the problems that con-
front McPhersons, there seems every
reason to expect an upward profit trend
as economic expansion continues and
as its huge capital expenditure in new
plant and equipment made over the
last two years begins to pay off. A price
of $2.75 could be close to the bottom,
this looks more like a $3.25 stock.
Nevertheless, the trends are all in
the wrong direction. In the year to
June, 1967, McPhersons’ turnover was
practically the same as two years before.
But the decline in its financial position
may be measured not only by its 22
percent net profit reduction since 1965
but by the 16 percent build-up in
stocks, and the 68 percent growth in
minority interests. The narrowing gap
between profits and dividends means
that shareholders’ funds were only 8
percent higher over the two years.
The 6 percent profit fall for the
latest year was attributed by the direc-
tors to increased costs, the establish-
ment of several new plants which did
not contribute to profits of the period,
and reduced margins brought about by
highly competitive conditions. This fall
was all in the first half of the year.
The December - half profits were
$1,186,000 ($1,480,000 in 1965-66),
down 20 percent, but profits rallied in
the June half from $1,076,000 to
$1,222,000, up 14 percent.
Shareholders will be eager to hear
whether this trend has continued at
the annual meeting on October 26.
Demand for the company’s many
products should be picking up. The
Treasurer, in his Budget speech, pre-
dicted private capital expenditure
would gather impetus as the year goes
on. And the Bank of New South Wales-
Associated Chamber of Manufactures
of Australia survey of industrial trends
for September 1967, indicated a “con-
tinued small rise in capital expenditure
on plant and machinery during the
next 12 months,” which is only
moderately encouraging for McPher-
sons. But manufacturers predicted a
further strong expansion in their own
operations in the next three nlonths
with expected larger orders, output,
and employment, which should eventu-
ally rub off on McPhersons.
In any event, directors expect the
current year to provide a “satisfactory”
result provided the economy continues
to expand at the present rate, helped
along by “the introduction of several
new manufacturing units and the new
organisational structure.”
McPhersons provides a full range of
stocks to meet the tool requirements
of secondary industry, the engineering
requirements of primary producers, and
is a steel merchant. While drought
continues to depress much of the rural
sector, and the auto industry remains
sluggish, confidence is reviving in
industry generally, and the unprece-
dented activity in mining, particularly
in W.A., provides a reasonable climate
for McPhersons’ activities. In the
machine-tool sales divisions, the com-
pany last year was adversely affected
by the general slowing-down and defer-
ment of many capital equipment
expansion programs in the manufac-
turing sector of the economy, where
excess capacity in many fields has be-
come apparent. Intense competition
from imports did not help, so the sales
result was unsatisfactory. The company
recognises the 'handicaps of high labor
costs in the local manufacture of
machine tools and gloomily warns of
the “basic problems that will be hard
to overcome.”
In manufacturing, bolt-and-nut pro-
duction was rationalised and efficiency
increased to meet the highly competi-
tive conditions prevailing. Intense com-
petition from foreign lathes and
generally lower demand prompted a
cutback in production owing to stock
accumulation in the Kensington
machine-tool works. A cheering feature
was the steady increase in demand ex-
perienced in the dust and fume control
and blast-cleaning division.
The increased dependence on bor-
rowings (the proprietorship ratio is
down from 64 to 56 percent in the
last two years) to finance the very big
capital expansion program ($7,879,000
spent in 1966 and 1967) has imposed
an interest burden of $534,000 (up
$90,000 for the year) on its profit-
earning capacity. Much of this borrow-
ing cost to 8 percent, but, even
though the dividend is only 8 1-3 per-
cent, share capital would have cost
almost twice as much to service. Share-
holders, anyway, had priority rights to
some of these note issues.
In March, 1966, the chairman (Mr.
W. D. McPherson) stated that since
July, 1964, the company had raised
sB.2m. Of this, $2.7m. was from share
issues, $2.7m. from mortgage borrow-
ings, sl.3m. from unsecured private

$3,768,000 At year’s end there were
uncompleted contracts for material
capital expenditure of $ ,421,000 (the

probably be a year of heavy capital
expenditure too. Although the gross

$3. 8m.) directors do not mention
investment allowances, and tax pro-
vided represented 40 percent of pretax
profit in 1966 and 43 percent in 1967.
In the last six years McPhersons
has purchased 13 acres at Alexandria,
N.S.W., to erect a fully automated
warehouse, purchased further storage
facilities in Brisbane, erected a new
store for the Adelaide branch, and
opened a new Perth warehouse in
March, 1966. In South Melbourne a
building was erected for the new
machine-tool sales division and a bulk
store for bolts. The Maryborough (Vic.)
toolmaker Patience and Nicholson
Ltd., in which McPhersons is a maj-
ority shareholder, also spent heavily on
a large building extension in 1966.
McPhersons’ manufacturing units are
bolt works at Richmond (Vic.), Alex-
andria (N.S.W.), and O’Connor
(W.A.), which should open this month,
a new nut works at Nunawading, pump
and brake block works at Tottenham,
machine toolworks at Kensington, and
foundries for the machine tool works,
at Tottenham, and for the pump works
at Kyneton, all in Victoria. For its
nation-wide wholesale and retail dis-
tribution of machine tool and indus-
trial supplies, the company maintains
a most comprehensive range of pro-
ducts. Group stocks were up sl.7m. to
s23m. over the last year, and while
directors maintained these were well
balanced and in line with demand,
they also revealed unplanned build ups
of machine tools and manufactures.
Group debtors on average pay within
a little more than 60 days, but the
stocks are turned over less than three
times a year.
Unless things are worse than the lat-
est accounts show (which seems un-
likely), McPhersons’ shares are now too
cheap. McPhersons’ 13.6 percent earn-
ing rate is better than for six of the
last ten years, when the market rated
the stock so much higher. Its dividend
is not in danger, its liquidity position
is quite healthy, and its credit rating is
high. For 22 years since the war it has
earned sound profits which gave at least
modest cover for dividends, sweetened
by occasional premium and latterly par
issues, and a bonus in June, 1961
(which, at one-for-two, gave no real
benefits, as the dividend was reduced
proportionately).
It may be some time before share-
holders can expect much in the way
of benefits from this company, but
there is the real prospect of a dividend
rise sooner or later from the present
uncomfortable-looking 8-1/3 percent.

Security analysis
National Bank shares show
limited growth
THE NATIONAL BANK of Austra-
lasia Limited is the second trading
bank whose shares are included in the
Melbourne Fifty Leaders Index. The
other banks have presumably not been
included because the Wales and the
National give sufficient weight to the
overall index. One might even question
whether two banks are necessary in the
index, but it must be remembered that
they are all very substantial companies
with quite substantial share capital. So,
although they are only seven in num-
ber, two must be included to give the
appropriate weight to the banks’ im-
portance in the share market.
The statistics on approximately the
same basis as those which were given
last week for the Wales, are:

If we make a comparison with the
Bank of New South Wales’ figures, it
is apparent that, while the absolute
figures for dividends and earnings are
higher in the case of the Wales, the
trend in the case of the National Bank
is somewhat more attractive. To make
the comparison rather easier, the figures
have been reduced to a $1 basis. There
is no problem so far as earnings and
dividends are concerned, except where
an adjustment has been made for a
rights issue. It is most likely that the
share price would not, in practice, be
reduced pro rata with the nominal
value. However, as the bonus content
of the last rights issue of the Wales
was only percent, approximately,
and as the bonus content of the last
rights issue of the National Bank was
only 12-|- percent, approximately, it is
doubtful whether there is much signi-
ficance in the price factor so far as
the adjusted earnings and dividend
series are concerned.

It is clear that there has been a
much greater growth in dividends per
share of the National Bank over the
past five years, even though the Bank
of New South Wales index will reach
108, ignoring the 175th anniversary
bonus dividend. Yet the price of the
National Bank’s shares would need to
rise by over 20 percent to match the
Wales’ shares on a dividend basis.
The only conclusion that one can
come to is that, although the Bank of
New South Wales has just had a new
issue while the National Bank’s last
issue was over three years ago, greater
dividend increases are expected in the
future from the Wales than are ex-
pected from the National. Perhaps the
clue to these expectations may lie else-
where in the published figures for those
two banks and it could possibly be in
the other items in the profit and loss
account.
The figures from the National Bank’s
profit and loss account are as follows:
Year to September 30, 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
$ million
Gross item 25.2 27.6 30.4 31.7 34.4
Expenses 21.3 23.2 24.8 27.0 28.4
Taxes 1.7 1.9 2.7 2.1 2.7
Profit 2.1 2.5 2.9 2.7 3.3
The rates of growth for the two banks
can be compared roughly by indices:
Gross item:
Bank of N.S.W. 100 108 124 134 142
National Bank 100 110 121 126 137
Expenses:
Bank of N.S.W. 100 106 121 137 149
National Bank 100 109 116 127 133
T axes:
Bank of N.S.W. 100 126 154 143 138
National Bank 100 112 159 124 159
One would have some difficulty in
finding any justification here for the
proposition that the trend in the Bank
of New South Wales’ figures show a
higher rate of growth than the trend
in the National Bank’s figures. In the
past two years, expenses in the case
of the Wales have been increasing at
a faster rate than the gross item and
taxes have been falling. In the case
of the National, the gross item has been

Loans and advances 313 319 372 431 470
Both banks seem to have shown
almost exactly the same growth in
loans and advances, but the National
has shown much greater growth in the
item of bills receivable, etc. Also,
growth in the item “long-dated
securities” seems to be greater in the
case of the National.
After all this study, one must still
come to the conclusion that over the
past few years the National Bank has
been growing at a rather faster rate
than the Bank of New South Wales.
The reason for the different pricing
then must be in the. price/earnings
ratios; it is not therefore surprising to
find that, at current prices, the Wales’
shares are selling at about 16.5 times
earnings, but the National’s shares are
selling at 20.4 times earnings. This
must mean that the market is prepared
to rely on the published earnings of the
banks to establish this ratio and has
decided that more growth can be ex-
pected from the National.
The factor which has not apparently
been considered is the comparability
of the earnings figures of the two banks.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell
whether they are directly comparable.
Because the rates of interest paid by
the free enterprise banks on deposits
and received by them for overdraft
accommodation are virtually the same,
one could have expected that other
sources of revenue and costs of obtain-
ing that revenue might also be much the
same for all banks. There would then
be good reason to expect the return
on net assets to be very similar, i.e., the
gross item in the profit and loss account
should show the same percentage to
shareholders’ funds. This does not prove
to be the case. The National Bank’s
percentage is consistently below that of
the Wales.
It is then very difficult to come to
any conclusion regarding bank shares
on the basis of an analytical appraisal
of the accounts. In this event, it is only
possible to assess the price that is to be
paid for the shares on an “emotional”
basis, such as “term loans will increase
the profits of the banks enormously.”
I still think that the growth that can
be expected from any bank share in
the long term is* quite limited. This has
been the case in the past when the Re-
serve Bank had less control than it has
today. There is no reason at this stage
to expect any major difference in the
future. In this event, price/earnings
multiples of 20 seem rather high and
dividend yields below 4 percent would
seem to put too great an expectation
on future increases in the dividend
rate.

Mining
Norseman blooms, with nickel
IN THIS YEAR of grace, Norseman
Gold Mines shareholders have seen
their holdings increase from $1 to $2
a share during the period January to
September, and in the past couple of
weeks another $1.65 has been added to
the shares. The rise which occurred
in the first half of the year was clearly
due to the company’s increasing
pyrites production, as well as its entry
into salt harvesting at Lake Lefroy.
Indeed, even after directors announced
last August that they had entered the
search for nickel, the market was fairly
cautious about marking the shares
above the $2 level.
The company obtained an option
over two old mines in the Kalgoorlie
area. One mine is situated three miles
south of Widgiemooltha, close to where
Anaconda, C.R.A. and New Broken
Hill Consolidated are drilling for
nickel, while the other is 25 miles to
the east of Widgiemooltha, which would
put it about ten to 20 miles south-east
of St. Ives, where Western Mining
Corporation has so far proved up
192,000 tons of sulphide ore containing
7.61 percent nickel, and is still drilling.
In addition, Norseman has applied- for
mineral claims covering 16,000 acres
extending along 12 miles, commencing
some four miles north-east of the old
Paris goldmine. The results obtained
in the Paris-St. Ives area by Western
Mining Corporation certainly justify
the comment by Norseman directors
that “this country is in geological
environs favorable to the occurence of
nickel mineralisation.”
Norseman Gold, which has only
750,000 shares outstanding, has a large
shareholding in Ravensthorpe Copper
Mines NL. It holds 390,000 shares in
this company, about 16 percent of the
issued shares, and the general manager
of Norseman, Mr. P. A. Charsley, is
technical director of Ravensthorpe.
Ravensthorpe has been battling for
some years against low grades, labor
shortages, and cost increases, and the
higher copper prices of the past two
years have meant only that the com-
pany has been able to slightly reduce
its accumulated losses, which now
stand at $623,000.
Ravensthorpe operates two small
mines and has sufficient finance for
only a limited amount of diamond
drilling and exploration. Nevertheless,
indications are for better things ahead;
output for the year to June last showed
some improvement, and it is expected
that the annual report will give details
of further mine development, which
last year encountered some higher
grade ore. Certainly, Ravensthorpe may
be experiencing better times, but the
current popularity of its shares (which
have risen from 35 cents to 53 cents in
two weeks) is perhaps more likely to
be founded on work done in the
Ravensthorpe area by a consortium
consisting of North Broken Hill (25
percent), Ampol Petroleum (10 per-
cent), Pickands Mather and Co. Inter-
national (20 percent), Cerro Corpora-
tion of New York (12J percent),
Dominion Foundries of Canada (10
percent), Pocantico Oil and Gas of
New York (12| percent), and Globe
Iron of Ohio (10 percent). In the
summer of 1964/5 this syndicate found
some copper and nickel anomalies in
the area, and the following year drill-
ing commenced to test these anomalies.
To date there has been no announce-
ment concerning these finds, but in the
current demand by the market for any
share with the vaguest connection to
a nickel-bearing area, Ravensthorpe
may prove to have what it takes.
The recent surge in the prices of both
Norseman and Ravensthorpe may have
something to do with the statement by
Mr. Lindsay Clark, of Western Mining,
that his company will be mining nickel
as deep as modern techniques allow.
Such a statement must surely give great
encouragement to those companies
which are on the periphery of Western
Mining’s rich areas, including both
Great Boulder and Norseman Gold
(which, incidentally, should not be con-
fused with Central Norseman Gold Cor-
poration N.L., the gold-mining sub-
sidiary of Western Mining Corpora-
tion).
THE ZAPATA-ODE drilling barge In-
vestigator should shortly be in position
to spud in a test drill on the Ashmore
Reef structure. The well is to go to
12,500 feet on an anticlinal structure
outlined by seismic survey work over
the past three years.
The actual lease, O.P. 141, is an
area of 314 sq. miles about 530 miles
west of Darwin and 230 miles from
the coast. In 1963 the lease appeared
as one of the areas held by Timor Oil
but it was acquired by Amalgamated
Petroleum during the 1965/66 year.
Amalgamated has assigned the area to
a group consisting of Burmah Oil of
Australia (to hold a one-third interest),
Shell Development (one third), Wood-
side (Lakes Entrance) Oil Company
(25 percent) and Mid-Eastern Oil N.L.
(8 l-3rd percent). Amalgamated re-
ceived a cash payment of $BOOO at the
time of transfer and will receive a
royalty of 2j percent on the wellhead
value of petroleum products. Under the
agreement payments to Amalgamated
are limited to $500,000.
The well is expected to take about
4 to 5 months to reach a total depth
of 12,500 feet and is the first of several
wells to be drilled in the near future
by various interests on the continental
shelf of offshore North Australia. Phil-

lips Petroleum is about to commence
drilling offshore in the Gulf of Papua
in an area adjacent to leases held by
Oil Search in conjunction with Esso
and British Petroleum and a well is
planned for this area early next year.
Amalgamated Petroleum recently
concluded a contract to supply 600,000
cubic feet per day of natural gas over
a period of 15 years to Associated Pipe-
lines Limited. This gas will come from
the company’s Snake Creek well and
Tarrawanga well, near Roma. Receipts
under this contract are expected to be
in the region of $300,000, up to a
maximum of $425,000, and the com-
pany will be drilling more wells under
a joint agreement with the Associated
Group at sites along the pipeline in
order to find reserves for further con-
tracts. The Associated Group owns 50
percent of Associated Pipelines Limited
and has contracts with Austral Pacific
Fertilizers Limited and the South Bris-
bane Gas and Light Coy. Limited to
supply a total of one hundred thousand
million cubic feet of gas over 15 years,
worth more than $40,000,000.
Should the Ashmore Reef prove a
commercial proposition, Amalgamated
will stand to receive $BOO,OOO to
$925,000 as a result of its gas sales and
oil royalties. This sum does not seem
particularly large against the company’s
$5.5 million paid capital but would
certainly reduce the need to call on
shareholders for future finance in order
to proceed with both its oil explora-
tion activities (by way of obtaining
interest in other worth-while offshore
areas) as well as the mineral explora-
tion in which the company has shown
interest. The company’s contributing
shares paid to 16 cents are selling at
6 cents and provide one of the lowest-
priced stakes available in the offshore
oil exploration companies.

Second thoughts on
wheat stocks
WHILE THE WHEAT subsidy wrangle
continues to provoke a deal of heat
within Australia (see “The Land,” page
79), more general concern with supplies
and pricing is at present leading to
plenty of discussion among the major
world wheat exporters. As noted briefly
in this section before, the overall stocks
position has changed completely since,
under the new International Wheat
Agreement, importing countries were
led to believe a £stg.3 a ton increase
was necessary.
Barely six months ago both growers
and buyers met in an atmosphere of
predicted shortage and of famine.
Growers argued for the price advance to
encourage what they thought were
urgently required greater plantings. At
this moment, however, the outlook is for
a considerable wheat surplus.
Indeed, Australia’s unhappily develop-
ing situation may be causing a little
satisfaction and relief abroad. One
source at least was talking about a
“last-minute setback” in the southern
hemisphere almost as a possible hope to
relieve the pressure of too J healthy
stocks.
The Australian situation, from our
own point of view, has of course sud-
denly become disastrous through the
drought—and this at a time when many
farmers have turned to wheat as a
speedy cash crop. The latest estimate
from the Bureau of Agricultural
Economics suggests that the harvest will
yield some 282 million bushels, com-
pared with, the previous reason’s record
426 million, and bring the crop’s value
down from $683 million to $428
million.

and Canada, things look entirely dif-
ferent. There is a faint hope that
America may reduce its acreage or per-
haps use much of its surplus to fill
reduced national stockpiles. Yet each
country is worried that dealings will
take place under the new agreement’s
floor and could direct its policy toward
providing support for the market.
The old agreement expired on July
31 and the new agreement does not
rule until July 1 next year. Until then
no real floor supports world wheat
prices. Price prospects are naturally
the principal determinant of how much
land will be sown to wheat in any
given year. Canadian supporters of a
world price agreement strongly main-
tain that price cutting upsets the en-
tire pattern of wheat production and
consumption.
The president of the Saskatchewan
Wheat Pool, Mr. C. W. Gibbings, has
put this argument firmly forward: “It
has been shown time and again that
lower grain prices do not increase
human consumption of wheat. All that
happens is that other exporters also cut
their prices and the amount going
into the market remains the same. No
one gains, but producers, like those in
Canada, where there is no govern-
ment subsidy, have their incomes dras-
tically reduced. Does each generation
have to learn all over again that price
cutting in the wheat market is futile?”
Charges of price cutting are flying
to and fro. Mr. Gibbings is blaming
the fall in Canadian prites on gradual,
but steady, undercutting by the United
States. There is a feeling that a whole
year of unregulated prices could create
an intense lack of interest in world
pricing agreements just when Can-
adian officials hope that other countries
will be ratifying the agreement. But
not much surprise will ensue if prices
do move lower in the months to come.
Competition between the wheat ex-
porters is sure to be heightened. And
even Canada intends to subsidise wheat
sold below the minimum until July
next.
Much of the huge world wheat sur-
plus of the past few seasons has been
produced in response to the failure
of Russian harvests and the prolonged
droughts in India (and other develop-
ing countries). These instigators of
big import demand are now furnishing
some evidence of reversal. Russia actu-
ally became a net exporter in 1966 and
is anticipating an adequate crop this
year. A lot of the wheatland prob-
lems look to have been overcome;
Russia may resume its old position as
a wheat exporter.
India, as well, should this year har-
vest more than 25 percent above the
average of the past two impoverished
seasons, due simply, to the proper sea-
sonal rains. One or two experts are
already talking of the possibility of
India getting on without grain imports
very soon. They also observe signs of
similar improvement in other Asian and
African countries.
It is at this interesting moment that
the Australian Wheatgrowers’ Federa-
tion is to ask for an increase in exports
covered by a guaranteed price from 150
to 200 million bushels.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICES
A certain patchiness has developed among some of the indus-
trial sections and has even extended to the miners. However,
dealings remain quite heavy and cannot obscure a few out-
standing individual efforts. BHP naturally took all eyes with
a cent leap to $14.90 (including the interim cents).
Still prominent was Western Mining, which added 10 cents to
reach $25.60. Other noteworthy mining advances included:
Hamersley, 50 cents; CRA, 10 cents; Mount Isa, 34 cents;
Broken Hill South, 50 cents. Mount Morgan dropped back
33 cents, while Peko added 24 cents.

THE LAND
The wheat subsidy argument
By E. J. DONATH
SOME $27.8m. of taxpayers’ money
was to subsidise the export of wheat
to China up to the end of the 1964/65
wheat year. This is true, despite last
week’s statement in Parliament by Mr.
Adermann, Minister for Primary Indus-
try, that “Australia was not subsidising
wheat sales to China.” A perusal of the
relevant sections, especially Appendix
13, of the 1965/66 annual report of the
Australian Wheat Board establishes
beyond any doubt that our wheat sales
to China, or to any other destination,
have been subsidised by taxpayers since
1959/60. In fact, by the end of this
year the taxpayers’ subsidy for export-
ing wheat to China will most likely
total more than s36m. I am not against
selling wheat to China, but the public
is entitled to know the facts.
On page six of the annual report
of the Wheat Board it is stated that
“when the per bushel average of total
export realisations for wheat of a sea-
son falls below the cost of production,
export returns are raised to the level
of the guaranteed price in respect of
up to 150 million bushels exported by
drawing on the Wheat Prices Stabilisa-
tion Fund. If the amount standing to
the credit of the Fund is insufficient to
meet such payments, the deficiency
is met from Consolidated Revenue.”
Taxpayers had to make up a
deficiency of s7sm. for the export of
the first five crops in the 19605, of
which nearly s2Bm. was due to our
China sales. By the time this year’s
harvest is sold, the subsidy will amount
to well over sloom., of which about
s36m. was used for the export of 580
million bushels to China. As a matter
of fact, the'amazing spectacle of our
wheat being sold to China at prices far
below those to other countries in-
creased the deficiency in the Stabilisa-
tion Fund considerably and thus made
necessary these huge contributions
from Consolidated Revenue.
Overseas wheat prices have been
falling for some months and several
countries, especially Canada, claim
that Australia’s “energetic wheat ex-
port drive” is partly to blame for prices
having gone even below the minimum
price of the recently concluded Interna-
tional Wheat Agreement. However, I
would not blame our Wheat Board for
“dumping” wheat overseas, as it has to
sell our all-time record harvest of 462
million bushels before the next crop
comes in.
The simple solution to subsidising
wheat export to China, or to other
countries, is to stop favoring the grow-
ing of wheat at the expense of other
land uses.
[Speaking in the House of Repre-
sentatives, the Minister for Primary
Industry, Mr. C. F. Adermann, very
strenuously criticised Mr. Donath’s
views on the wheat subsidy. He stated
that Mr. Donath asserted the Federal
Government had subsidised the wheat
industry to the extent of s23m. in
recent years. “The Government had
never reached the figure of s23m. by
way of subsidy,” Mr. Adermann main-
tained.
A payment of about $22.6m. one
year related to No. 26 pool, which was
about five years ago, he said, and Mr.
Donath did not make any reference
to the succeeding year when about
sl.Bm. was paid.
“When Donath makes a general
statement like that and implies that it
represents the present position, he is
misleading the public,” the Minister
claimed. “There are different qualities
of wheat prime hard, hard, f.a.q.,
and off-grade wheat and if it is
thought that you can make a simple
mathematical calculation across the
board, as Donath does, then you had
better have another look at the facts.”
On the general matter of wheat sales
to China, Mr. Adermann explained
that, if it were not for these sales, Aus-
tralia would be unable to dispose of
millions of tons of rain-affected, off-
grade wheat which became available in
some years.]
Agrisearch
The perils of Newcastle disease
NEWCASTLE DISEASE is the world’s
worst affliction of poultry. Almost
everywhere poultrymen commonly have
to undertake the exacting and costly
chore of vaccinating every chicken if
they are to stay in business. For in-
stance, the British Ministry of Agricul-
ture spent $2O million in 1962 in a
national effort to eradicate the disease,
but has not achieved this goal. Austra-
lia is one of the few lucky countries,
although we have always lived in fear
of the disease becoming established here
and expended much money on quaran-
tine measures to keep it out. Now it
appears that the virus is already wide-
spread throughout the eastern States,
at least. Fortunately, the virus in its
current form is of very low virulence
and does not usually make the birds
obviously sick. Indeed, the CSIRO
annual report calls the virus “harm-
less” and even implies that it may be
beneficial because an immune national
flock could result.
This is a reassuring appraisal by a
characteristically sober-sided institution
and, hopefully, will turn out to be
correct. But it may not be unduly
pessimistic to point out that there are
certain disturbing features. In the first
place, be it noted, the virus has truly
spread like wildfire fair warning that
a highly virulent strain would travel
scarcely less quickly. Its presence was
first suspected in January, 1966, when
Mr. G. C. Simmons, of the Queensland
Department of Primary Industries, in-
vestigated the cause of ill-thrift among
chickens on a broiler farm near Bris-
bane.
He isolated a virus which behaved
like Newcastle Disease Virus and sent
it to the CSIRO Animal Health
Laboratory in Melbourne for typing
against a known sample of Newcastle
virus. That laboratory, which had been
permitted to keep in storage a virulent
strain of virus collected 35 years ago
when the disease occurred temporarily
in Victoria, confirmed his fears and
showed that the Queensland strain
was of very low virulence. (The Vic-
torian outbreaks in 1930 and again in
1932 were detected before they had
spread very far and were stamped out
by slaughtering all birds in the area.)
By late 1966 Mr. Simmons had found
his virus on a dozen poultry farms in
south-east Queensland and officers of
the Departments of Agriculture in New
South Wales and Victoria had also
made similar discoveries. There is rea-
son to believe that the disease did not
occur in any form anywhere in Australia
as recently as 1964 because a fairly
thorough search happened to have been
made for it that year without uncover-
ing any evidence of its presence,
The second disconcerting aspect is
that this virus has, presumably, pene-
trated the quarantine screen. If a weak
strain can get through, then a strong
one can also. No one seems to know
how the Queensland strain entered the
country. One suggestion is that it may

have arrived in smuggled sperm. What-
ever the pathway the incident serves
notice once again of the ultimate
futility of relying solely on quarantine
measures to preserve our livestock in-
dustries. Regulations can only be re-
garded as forward trenches. Many
veterinarians believe that the existing
arrangements for battling invasions by
strange diseases are altogether too
flimsy. The main trouble is that Aus-
tralia has virtually no field officers
possessing any familiarity with the
exotic diseases and no vaccines stock-
piled. Ironically, the quarantine regula-
tions help to perpetuate this state of
affairs.
Local study of these diseases is ham-
pered. The establishment of an exotic
diseases laboratory has often been
mooted, but no steps are taken. Occa-
sionally someone is sent overseas to
study some particular disease thit
happens to be rampaging, but that is
about the extent of our effort to pro-
vide second-line defence.
A third scary possibility is that the
weak Queensland strain may change,
just as the flu viruses do from time to
time, into more virulent forms. The
chances of this happening are,
admittedly, rather remote, because any
virus likes to come to terms with its
host so that both can live happily to-
gether ever after. The myxomatosis
story provides a notorious example.
Overseas, where the Newcastle virus is
part of the natural fauna, there is a
multitude of strains which fall into three
groups of virulence—weak, medium,
and strong. A similar spectrum could
develop here.
The next thing to’ notice is that
although the Queensland strain made
chickens resistant to the 35-year-old
virulent strain it has not been shown
that mature birds will also acquire im-
munity. Moreover, after 35 years of
storage, the Victorian strain may not
be as virulent as it once was, and if
chickens infected with the Queensland
virus were to be challenged with one of
the really potent overseas strains their
resistance might collapse.
Finally, it may well be that the
Queensland strain is harmless when
acting alone. However, when a chicken
is hit simultaneously with it and two
or three other diseases which also
individually are practically harmless,
its health could be seriously under-
mined. It must be remembered that the
original discovery of the virus was
made when the poultry farmer near
Brisbane became concerned about the
unthriftiness of his chickens and in-
vited Mr. Simmons’ study. These days
the economic success of poultry farm-
ing depends on narrow tolerances.
Dramatic death rates may put a man
out of business in a month, but the
repeated loss of a week’s growth
caused by mild illness among the re-
placement stock may slowly but
surely grind away the profits.

ENTERTAINMENT
Hancock, the doyen of failures
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Tony Hancock. Dendy Theatre, Mel-
bourne.
Rhinorceros. lonesco. Russell Street,
Melbourne.
How’s the World Treating You. Roger
Milner. St. Martin’s, Melbourne.
HAVING been spoiled by the larger-
than-lifeness of hi-fi and stereo, I’m
always wanting to adjust the treble
and boost the base at orchestral con-
certs. Similarly, as Hancock walked on
stage I felt a Pavlovian compulsion to
turn up his volume and adjust his
contrast. And—as if it wasn’t hard
enough to cope with the smallness and
pinkness of this grey eminence of TV
there was also the problem of seeing
him on the stage of a suburban cinema.
There he was, fighting to establish a
bridgehead between the Cinesound
newsreel and the Val Morgan slides,
with an audience who’d rarely, if ever,
seen a live performer before.
Hancock, to those of us who love
him, is the doyen of failures. As a
comic creation, Anthony Aloysius is
always falling between ambition stools
and missing life’s bus. Self confident in
his profound mediocrity, his middle-
class pretentions fail to convince and
his attempts at pomposity are never
imposing.
His stage act is based completely on
the poignancy of his aspirations. He
whirls into a dance routine only to
founder. He launches into song only
to lose momentum. He gives appalling
impressions of Noel Coward and Win-
ston Churchill. As he specialises in
shortcomings, his act can afford to be
a rag-bag and it is. Fike the anti-
hero of the modern novel, Hancock is
an anti-entertainer. Probably good
jokes would reduce him to impotence.
In literature as diverse as Aboriginal
legend and Orwell, animals are
endowed with human characteristics.
The prolonged veterinarian metaphor
is a potent creative tool.
Ten ago lonesco took the idea
to its logical conclusion and wrote a
play about an entire village catching
rhinoceritis. Presumably he selected
rhinos because of their symbolically
thick-skins, pig-eyes, herd-instincts,
short-sightedness, and bad tempers.
Even their color, the greyness of con-
formity, offers usual useful ammuni-
tion.
In lonesco’s village everyone suc-
cumbs to the temptations of Rhinoism,
immuring themselves in thick folds
of skin and sprouting brutal horns.
Marxist dogmatists, preposterous aca-
demics, civic dignitaries, all capitulate.
Only the village drunk refuses meta-
morphosis, discovering instead the
virtues of human sensitivity.
It’s a good impactive idea. The only
trouble is that lonesco lacks the
inventiveness to make it stretch the
three acts. During Act Two he com-
pletely runs out of new ideas, and
George Whaley’s production unavoid-
ably palls as a result. Rhinoceri
thunder around the theatre without
particular point, and lonesco’s holy
drunk makes interminable and repeti-
tive speeches about non-conformity.
Whaley’s production is in no way to
blame for the ultimate boredom. He’s
had the good sense to excise nine pages
of dialogue, and he’s been inventive
in staging.
Richard Prins helps out with an
exceptional set made largely of news-
paper. The constant reminder of the
oppressiveness of mass media this pro-
vides is appropriate and enriching.
And as the producer himself ob-
serves if you tire of the play you
can read the set. Prins’ Tenniel-style
costumes are also lots of fun, as are the
performances of Monica Maughan and
Frank Thring. Thring has a scene in
which he sheds his irksome humanity
and becomes a rhino in full view. It is
an extremely convincing transforma-
tion, much more so than that of George
Ogilvie’s increasing philosophical drunk.
But at least Ogilvie attacks his part
wholeheartedly and goes down fighting.
Whaley avoids committing himself
as to the significance of lonesco’s herd.
Whether the rhino represents totalitar-
ianism or ordinary human conformity
Hancock...after Cinesound
is left an open question, although
Rumanian-born lonesco does describe
himself as a “Right-wing anarchist.”
St. Martin’s have imported a new
set of faces for Roger Milner’s comedy,
and George Fairfax, like George
Whaley, has mounted an inventive
production. But he, too, is faced with
a play which peters out completely in
the third act. Until then the proceed-
ings are lively enough and concern
de-bagged military officers and preg-
nant debutantes. But the evening ends
in excruciating boredom. A pox on
authors who can’t last the distance.
Pinter's charade
By ROBERT WARD
The Homecoming. Pinter. Teachers’
College Theatre, Adelaide.
Hay Fever. Coward. Union Hall, Ade-
laide.
THERE’S AN interesting minor
theatrical controversy in Adelaide at
the moment concerning who or what
is, isn’t, or should be styled “profes-
sional.” While it is true that the full-
time producer or actor is generally
much more accomplished than the
part-time, one simply cannot forget that
in Adelaide in particular the best
amateur theatre proves as good as the
best professional. So far this year, six
or seven productions have been first-
class, but only two were professional,
both directed by John Tasker for the
South Australian Theatre Company.
One of these productions, “The
Homecoming,” is currently playing. It
closes the SATC’s season for this year
and perhaps for some time, since rumor
has it that the company has been
dropped from the Adelaide Festival.
Why this should be I cannot for the
life of me understand, except that Mar-
lene Dietrich has taken over the Teach-
ers’ College Theatre, and perhaps the
city fathers feel she is more culturally
profitable.
“The Homecoming” again displays
very patently Mr. Tasker’s efficient
direction. When he is at his best, his
plays have a formal, finely detailed,
solid quality. For this play, Pat Fack-
rell has designed a large late-19th-
century lower middle-class parlor with
heavy ’thirties furniture, all faded
and ugly, in which Pinter’s faded and
ugly characters act out their sexual
charade. The humor, which lies very
much on the surface of the dialogue,
is delivered brutally and thus correctly.
Ruth, played by Judy Dick, is


tense, thin-lipped, and coldly lusting,
while Martin Redpath's Telddy hS
husband, acts an ineffectual and be-
mused brain-drain professor of philo-
sophy, returning from America to visit
the old slum. When his brothers and
father arrange for Ruth to be the family
whore, neither he nor the audience is
surprised. It all seems naturally un-
natural. The play is ugly, the charac-
ters are animal, no point is made, and
we laugh throughout.
a ...
Its only justification is that it is by
Pinter and cleverly written. It is also
cleverly directed, with superb charac-
terisations like Hedley Cullen’s, who,
as the father, is a rasping, self-centred,
opinionated idiot of an old man. The
performance is worth seeing in itself.
Noel Coward’s “Hay Fever” is pro-
duced by the The Players, a newly
formed company. One wishes them
well, but is not optimistic. A profes-
sional company needs a lot of money,
a good director, good players, and a
place to perform. At the moment, the
Adelaide University Theatre Guild has
lent them Union Hall, but this is short
Judy Dick as Ruth and Chris Johnston as Lenny in “The Homecoming Teacher s
College Theatre, Adelaide
term. They have not yet been able to
find the other essentials.
In other words, while The Players
have had a lot to say publicly about
their professionalism, and while it
seems they are splitting profits, most
members work at other jobs during the
day, and the presentation overall is
really no better than what is served
run-of-the-mill by candidly amateur
companies.
The play was written in 1925 and

Films
Not by the Book
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Gospel According To St. Matthew,
Director, Pasolini.
THE STORY of Christ exerts an
understandable appeal for film-makers,
but generally the results haven’t lived
up to the presumable sincerity of the
intention. These movies either wallow
in a bath of Bible-picture sentimentality
(like “Ben Hur” or “The King Of
Kings”) or else are so determined to
avoid emotional excesses that they
become null and dull, like “The Great-
est Story Ever Told.”
Pasolini’s film quite brilliantly avoids
both pitfalls. He has deliberately turned
away from obvious picturesqueness and
spectacle no well-laundered white
robes here, no parades of glittering
Roman soldiers, not even an orgy. He
has photographed the film in austere
black and white in the Calabrian land-
scape, a harsh, stony countryside with
no obvious beauty; the crowds are small
and dressed in much-worn clothing,
obviously designed to be efficient rather
than becoming.
The trial of Christ is seen from
behind the heads of a knot of not-too-
concerned spectators; only His own
disciples and friends follow Him to His
Crucifixion, while the majority of by-
standers hardly bother to turn their
heads to watch yet another judicial
execution.
But probably Pasolini’s greatest inno-
vation is in his interpretation of the
central character. This is neither the
gentle apostle of love nor the submis-
sive Man of Sorrows. “Gentle Jesus,
meek and mild,” indeed! This is a
fierce-eyed, determined man, arrogant in
the strength of His convictions, ruling
His disciples by an almost dictatorial
authority rather than by love. He does
not convert or persuade, He gives
orders. Even gentle admonitions about
loving thy neighbor and turning the
other cheek are barked out like barrack-
square commands.
Given this aggressive Christ, the High
Priest’s pursuit of Him is shown to
stem less from malice than from poli-
tics. This is the silencing of a man who
seems to them a dangerous rabble-
rouser, a threat to an Establishment
only precariously maintained, whose
claim to divinity is presumptuous but
irrelevant. Yet the faith of the disciples
and Jesus’ own certainty ate powerfully
set forth. He is a man destroyed, it
seems, because of a general misunder-
standing of His real motives. Even the
disciples, loyal and loving as they are,
have only a dim comprehension of His
message.
This is very much a director’s film.
The players are brilliantly chosen for
their physical appearance, but acting
is of secondary importance to the
director’s manipulation. Pasolini’s grip
of the film does occasionally fail, of
course: his treatment of the miracles is
surprisingly ineffective, being literal and
oddly apologetic, as if the confessedly
agnostic director suddenly got fright-
ened of explaining them rationally yet
couldn’t bring himself to surrender
wholeheartedly to their miraculous
nature.
The Angel of the Lord, a pretty
creature with Botticelli curls, is his one
concession to romanticism. And I can’t
help feeling that Salome must have
been a little more provocative than the
one in this film.
But the film mostly has an austere
poetry about it, and as an interpreta-
tion is impressive and coherent, uncom-
fortable and surprising but stimulating
even to the most orthodox Christian.
After all, the story of Christ is surely
supposed to cause you to think and
wonder, whether you see it as legend
or accept it as literally Gospel truth.

Art
Swallowing the
texture pill
By ELWYN LYNN
Gordon Rintoul, Paintings. Barry Stern
Galleries, Sydney.
lan McKay, Sculpture. Darlinghurst
Galleries, Sydney.
WITH THE SHOW of ten textured
co-relatives of the rough side of the
landscape by Gordon Rintoul, one
might ask if there is a textural “move-
ment” in Australia with artists like
Sheila McDonald, Terry Sellers, Frank
Elodgkinson, Peter Clarke, Bill Fergu-
son, Jan Riske, Bill Peascod, Ignacio
Marmol, and Juan Almoril, the last
two being real Spaniards—some of the
others, in the quaint words of a gallery
assistant, having “only visited Spain”—
in what is generally thought of as a
Spanish school.
It could hardly be called a move-
ment in Australia, for the artists’ aims
are too diverse, but one could ask why
Australians, through whose art there
runs at times a melancholic and cata-
clysmic strain, should find it inspiring;
it should not be too much identified
with Spain, for, although it had ad-
herents in South America, Crippa and
Burri made something of it in Italy, as
did Dahmen, Schumacher, and Hoehme
in Germany, the Germans being con-
cerned with disrupting the surfaces of
flat abstraction and tearing holes in the
veils of delicate color that floated down
from Vuillard and Bonnard.
The peril of texture painting is an
over-reliance on surface effects and
secondary pleasures at the expense of
the immediacy of the iconic presence;
Marmol and Rintoul are sometimes
seduced by pleasant variations on the
surface. This surface decor was inci-
pient in Spanish painting when it broke
full force at the Venice Biennale of
1958 where those tiresome gravediggers
of abstraction found, it made from the
earth to which they wanted to con-
sign it. Among the great Spaniards, like
Tapies, Millares, Cuixart, and Saura,
were some like Turcios, Feito, and
Vela too concerned with atmospherics
and others too close to their motifs of
corroded wall and strata. The best had
a classical solemnity that one finds here
sometimes in Almoril, Clarke, Peascod,
and Sellers.
Such paintings in the radiant, air-
conditioned ’sixties do look wrinkled,
withered, and pessimistic; geological
specimens rather than lambent, floral
growths. One could speculate on the
relation of optimistic color-field paint-
ing to affluent cosmopolitan centres and
the hedonistic ideologies of eternal
youthfulness, for certainly if you are
pleasure bent, texture painting is a hard
pill to swallow.
What did strike people as curious in
1958 at the Biennale was that the Rus-
sian artists there were still winning
World War II and praising man as
pioneer and protector —an ideological
puppet compared with Melbourne’s
myth-laden heroes and that Spanish
authorities (actually, it was all the work
of one man, Luis Robles) were demon-
strating liberal attitudes.
In any case, the Spanish Government
would have been wrong to consider such
abstraction apolitical, and Hitler, Stalin,
and his heirs were correct, for abstrac-
tion can have an individuality and
privacy that runs counter to totalitarian
homogeneity, and, in fact, in Spain it
has led to a gloomy, carnal biomorphic
eroticism not the frivolous kind of
Boucher, Fragonard, and modern Pop-
sters and such have been the cen-
sorious pressures, that began with Hodg-
kinson’s show in Madrid, January, 1963,
that Saura spends more time abroad
and Cuixart refers to Hitlerian perse-
cution.
In its non-figurative heyday, texture
painting had an uningratiating reserve
that had little appeal but acknowledged
power; it has not attracted the English,
and despite America’s brief foray into
debris - strewn collage only Martha
Jackson in New York shows one Span-
iard, Tapies, though the Bonino does
exhibit some South American modified
texture painters.
Rintoul has much more appeal than
most; the associations with pebbled
river-bed and eroded shoreline are
easily made: in Floating Landscape a hill
imitates stucco. He’s more adventurous
in Whitescape, where some Arp-shaped
clouds of cutout canvas stay put above
a visceral blue river, and in Desert
Growth, with its tumbleweed of trans-
lucent skeins rolling below a dark green
sky. Best is simplest: in Red Storm
stained scarlet lava clouds lash above
a beautifully modulated, crumbling
bluish fawn and bleached land.
Some have an oddly clammy, surreal
note; not so much with the orange-
spotted form that lies athwart smashed
quartz undergoing a sea-change in
Marine Abstraction, but certainly with
the slippery, Baconish biological forms
that grow like tumors in Coastal Land-
scape and the large Earth Tremor.
Though it is a form that could be a
debris-strewn flood, it reveals a depar-
ture from, in many cases, too great a
concern with geological structure.
lan McKay, who marks time in his
show of sculptures, is so entranced by
grey and fawn sandstone that in Relief
Landscape he leaves it relatively
untouched and seems unwilling to carve
stone as deeply as his cubist inclina-
tions demand. Like many texturologists,
he idolises the material, yet in his lar-
gest work he balances gentle curves with
sharp lines and gives the bulky sand-
stone an unusual levitation; Hovering
Bird has the poise of a bird of stone
caught in flight, but too often he is
earthbound, though in a different sense
from Rintoul; just because sandstone
looks such an honest material it doesn’t
need to be treated with all this respect.


GOING
INTO
SMOKE
By R. J. SCHOLFIELD
AUSTRALIA IS currently, at the Von
Bertouch Galleries, Newcastle, and the
Stern Gallery, Sydney, taking its first
public look at the products of the
accident which led artist David Boyd
to discover, while he and his wife were
drying invitation cards over a candle
flame in their London flat, the tech-
nique of sfumato a term borrowed
from Leonardo da Vinci.
As originally coined by Leonardo, the
word sfumato no more signified actual
smoke than one means a woman is on
fire when she is said to smoulder. Since
then, real smoke has been used toward
the end Leonardo had in mind in-
finite gradations of tone, the defining of
forms by area rather than line but
Boyd claims to be the first ever to draw
with it. He does so standing beneath a
horizontal board and manoeuvring a
squat candle around under it, shadows
playing over his face, and the whites of
his upturned eyes showing like a coal-
miner’s.
It looks difficult to do, and, indeed,
several imitators have proved unequal
to it, one, Boyd will tell you with a
chuckle, setting his attic alight. But he
has practised hard and now wields the
candle, some thousands of which he
has so far consumed, as fluently as the
brush.
Besides the access it gives to qualities
of tone that prompt critics to see hints
of Rembrandt and Goya, in some of
Boyd’s faces, sfumato offers a number
of bonuses at near-gimmick level. It is
ideal, for example, for drawing breasts
and fingernails. At another level, it
provides an antidote for one of the
painter’s enemies: tightening-up. The
technique breeds dash and verve.
Sfumato, like many events in Boyd’s
artistic life, came to him at the right
moment. Most of the 43-year-old Mel-
bourne-born painter’s career has been
marked out over the past 20 years by a
number of series, all recording some
kind of social concern and all examin-
ing the relationship and interchange-
ability of victim and oppressor. Parallel
with this has continued, and still does,
his fascination with the stories of the
Old Testament and his consequent
visual comments on matters like the
lechery of the temple elders.
First came the Explorer series, which

Going into smoke
pupated Boyd out of a childhood
steeped in Australian legends, a story-
telling sequence with the speared white
man forgiving a puzzled Aboriginal as
he sinks into the swamp, showing
violence as a product of fear. Then, as
an extension of this but with attention
turned to collective violence, came the
Truganini series on the extinction of the
Tasmanian Aborigines.
Out of them grew the Trial pictures,
an inevitable consequence of belonging
to a family whose Australian genera-
tions have contained no fewer than
14 judges, including Victoria’s first
Chief Justice, and of having been in-
stalled at the age of 15, on his mother’s
wish, as a clerk in a legal firm that
gave him a loathing for the processes
of the judiciary and an appreciation
of the difference between law and jus-
tice.
He began the Trial series in 1960
and pursued it after going to Rome in
1962 on an Italian Government art
scholarship. The move worked well be-
cause he had wished not to content him-
self with a “Hogarthian” interpretation
of the judiciary, merely caricaturing
it as a social outrage, but to go deeper
and suggest a force dividing human be-
ings in such a way that they place them-
selves in positions of judgment upon
each other, the prisoner judging the
judge as the judge judges the prisoner.
“So I interchanged these roles,” re-
calls Boyd, “and it became a mono-
lithic thing, and, being in Rome, sur-
rounded by a monolithic environment,
with tumbledown columns and layer
upon layer of life, was good for me be-
cause it was conducive to images or
the outward sort of vision that brings
about an inner growing of monolithic-
type forms.”
After that, and leading up to his most
successful London exhibition in July,
1965, came the Church and State series,
an exorcising of the religious bug from
whose bite at an early age, when
priestly inclinations almost carried him
off, he had never quite recovered.
“I was concerned with not only the
Old Testament but contradictions in
Christian dogma. Applied to the
Catholic faith, it was to do with the
question of morality, how a hierarchy
grew out of primitive man’s need for
some outside force for goodness, and
how man invented the idea of a per-
sonal deity, an essential part of his
ability to stay alive and cope with the
forces of nature and himself.
“But as he developed and ration-
alised certain aspects of his own exist-
ence he still carried with him these old
trappings. I thought about this a lot
and got the image of a hun, whose
marriage to Christ was described as be-
ing a sort of grey sexual substitute. Her
preparation for meeting Christ, the
denial of her natural self, struck me as
a most incredible form of cruelty
though not only that, because many
people get relief from it.
“This was the initial sort of idea I
had about questions of the Church, and
when I went to Spain the second time
I saw it revealed symbolically in the
form of the bishop’s mitre and linked
with the guardia civil’s hat as a symbol
of State. It was timely that these images
crystallised all I had been thinking
about.”
The next stage of Boyd’s career was
a return to London, where he visited
Soho strip clubs and looked hard at the
city’s life and absorbed the material for
the present series. The link with the
previous chapter was that in Rome he
had tried hashish and got to know some
artists and former American students,
degenerates whose minds had been
destroyed by the drug and who were
now entirely obsessed with it, talking
and thinking about nothing else.
During a previous five years in Lon-
don in the ’fifties, Boyd had been
absorbing things without knowing quite
what. And he did not at the time, in
Rome, relate to painting his close study
of hashish. Likewise, his recent pre-
occupation with the Soho strippers and
pot smokers, after a second five-year
term in London, took him, as a painter,
by surprise, sprung, when it came, by
the accident of sfumato. For Boyd,
after the Church and State series, had
reached a crisis in his work, feeling the
direction he would like it to take but
uncertain how to get there. Sfumato
freed him, and at the same time came
the feeling that after ten years in Lon-
don he was at last ready to say some-
thing about it.
“It gave me a perfect means for
dealing with the strippers and pot
smokers,” he says. “I wanted to take
them outdoors, away from their clubs
and into a kind of limbo a context
not really achievable with straight oils.
Now I can do it.”
One of the latest series, The Film
Star, which an American collector
bought for 600 guineas on the last day
of his latest exhibition at London’s
Zwemmer Gallery in June, has, he
claims, taught him things about film
stars he did not suspect before, not
through having researched them but
from being forced to dredge truths up
from depths in himself.
Boyd remains as loyal to his ideals
as a figurative painter as when, in 1959,
he united with brother Arthur and a
number of Melbourne painters in the
Antipodian Movement to restate the
validity of their art in the face of a
growing bemusement with abstract that
was threatening to turn people against
all recognisable images.
“I like to remain in control,” he
says. “It is tempting sometimes to let
the subconscious take over without
direction, but I don’t think there’s any
revelation to be had this way. If you
draw on your subconscious in a manner
that is obscure, then people have to
have this rapport with your sub-
conscious to understand, and the most
it can ever mean to an onlooker is a
mass of hieroglyphics with no meaning.
It need not be cheating, but it is so
personal and private that the only
meaning it can give is what someone
wants it to have.
“Aesthetically, of course, it might be
pleasing, and maybe there will come a
time when people will simply say ‘Boo!’
to each other and tremendous profun-
dity will be involved. But painting for
me, like writing, is a language, and
must be treated so.”
Painting is also a therapy for Boyd.
He likes playing the piano and keeps
his hand in at pottery, but is happiest
when he is painting away in the front-
room studio of the big decrepit house,
which he is gradually doing up, in
Islington, off London’s seedy Cale-
donian Road. He bought the place
six years ago, before property in the
once-despised neighborhood started
climbing in value.
About the Boyd menage is an air
of extreme relaxation, as though the
passionate anti-violence that is at the
centre of the man took in energy as
well, leaving dead matches in peace
on the floor, the carpet to come to
terms with stains; elegant pots, pictures,
and books to mingle democratically
with old tics, gramophone records, and
broken cardboard boxes; the grand
piano to rise above it all, like an air-
craft carrier in a storm.
He works steadily seven days a
week if not disturbed, but does not
mind interruptions, especially when
they involve a stroll up the street to
the “local,” whither, after calling Her-
mia from the Costa Brava, their name
for the rooftop where she sunbathes
in summer, and pausing on the front
steps to pick up their black cat and
stretch it, he proceeds in a clerical
black suit speckled with color, as
though from a paint-box explosion.
London suits him well, though only
London and not Britain. “The thing
about it is that it is international, the
hub of the English-speaking world, even
though it is smack in the middle of a
down - trodden degenerating nation.
London is not England, and if you re-
moved it I’d be the first out of here.”
He also likes sitting on Paris boule-
vards, sipping coffee and watching
leaves fall, and he has a sensual sort
of nostalgia for the Australian country-
side, though preferring people to trees.
The immediate future, for Boyd, lies
in developing the images stemming
from the limbo concept associated with
the Soho strippers, using the prospect
opened by the sfumato to apply it in a
legendary sense and refining the candle-
carbon technique.
“I think,” says Boyd, “humanity has
reached the stage where people are
no longer prepared to accept the tradi-
tional conventions and mores and are
trying to understand more about their
natural environment. They are shaking
things off, and this implies a kind of
limbo out of which may burst forth
something fresh.” As, perhaps, Boyd
himself is doing.


BOOKS
Douglas Stewart: a poet of
evasive scepticism
By VIVIAN SMITH
Collected Poems. Douglas Stewart.
Angus and Robertson. $6.25.
DOUGLAS STEWART has never
had the attention he deserves as a lyric
poet. The two main recent studies of
Australian poetry virtually ignore him,
and comment on his work has generally
tended to centre on his plays. This is
a pity, because Stewart is a very fine
poet indeed, one of the best this
country has produced, as a reading of
his handsomely produced “Collected
Poems” confirms. Apart from the par-
ticular pleasure of individual poems,
there is a special satisfaction in seeing
how fully Stewart has developed over
the years. In his most recent pieces he
has opened up new veins of continuity
and found fresh sources of inspiration
and renewal.
“Collected Poems” is something of
a novelty in its arrangement. It begins
with Stewart’s most recent pieces a
whole new book in itself and works
backwards to his earliest poems. The
arrangement itself is Stewart’s critical
comment on his own development. He
has been fairly strict in his assessment;
some of his earlier volumes have been
severely treated, especially “Sonnets to
the Unknown Soldier” (1941) and
“Elegy for an Airman” (1940), his
weakest work. But if he has rightly
eliminated in places, he has been fair
enough to his earlier and younger
poetic selves, and presents all that we
need to make an estimate of his work.
Stewart’s earliest poems show him
working under a variety of influences,
most noticeably Roy Campbell, with
immature assimilations of the middle
and later years. He seems to have
favored from the start the sequence of
short poems; and his characteristic tone
and use of words emerge as early as
“Day and Night With Snow,” or in
“The Grasses Bend with Frost,” where
the tone and the attitude are not re-
markably different from those of later
poems like “Blowaway Grass” or
“Ants.” Relaxed and casual, the diction
only differs in the purpose to which it
is put. There seems, however, to have
been a period of some uncertainty be-
tween “The White Cry” and “Glencoe”
the time when Stewart’s energies
were most concentrated on his plays—
and there is a sense that his poetry
wasn’t being worked at full stretch.
After the late ’forties he starts to come
fully into his own; and there is no
doubt that future critical attention will
concentrate particularly on this part of
his work.
Stewart’s work as a whole can be
usefully characterised by its evasive
scepticism; he gets there, like his butter-
fly, by “Flying Crooked”; and whether
he is developing an idea, or exploring
points of view, or merely observing an
animal or a plant, his imagination
seems to work through a series of
poised suspensions, hoverings, oscilla-
tions.
These are clear enough in poems
like “Terra Australis,” where Captain
Quiros and William Lane meet on the
Pacific. The jaunty sprightliness of the
rhythm gives the whole a light-hearted
zest, but the poem is none the less
penetrating for making its point so un-
assertively. Tone and rhythm as much
as situation become a means of ques-
tioning attitudes, or puncturing illusions
—as they do in that other fine poem
“The Garden of Ships.”
Stewart uses the method of the jux-
taposition and deliberately uncertain
interplay of images to remarkable effect
in his small nature poems; a fungus
is compared with an octopus; a moth
with a flower; trees with works of art;
and through the controlled interplay
of these images the object itself emerges
with real precision and clarity. One of
the most recent and wholly delight-
ful —poems in this vein is “Moreton
Bays” (“Half elephant and half a
tree”):
And vast and slow they’d all be gone
Like sailing ships, like clouds at noon,
To India or green Ceylon;
But three big feet before, behind,
And three on either side, I find,
It must bewilder them in mind,
They cannot visit their connections,
They cannot move in all directions
Or they would split in several
sections.
Stewart is an extremely varied poet
and he has tried his hand at more
forms and kinds than any other Aus-
tralian poet, with the exception of A. D.
Hope. Ballads, narrative-sequences,
light verse—these are only part of his
output. But his finest poems seem to me
Douglas Stewart... fresh sources
to be the group of nature poems
poems like “Flowering Bloodwoods,”
“Spider Gums,” “A Robin,” “A Flock
of Gang-gangs,” “Brindabella,” “Snow
Gums,” and “Silkworms.” They are
the triumph of Stewart’s art. At once
casual and concerned, self-possessed
and enthusiastic, reticent and joyful,
they celebrate aspects of the slow
miracle of nature. Their arresting use of
•ghost rhymes, coupled with their very
individual and sometimes deliberately
uneven rhythm, suggests both the pre-
cise delineation and clarity of things
and the enclosing sense of muffling
silence; and both contribute to their
delicate modulations of feeling:
And one white feather in his wing,
Flashing from twig to rock,
From rock to the shallow pool
That reels with the tiny shock,
The robin darts to bathe
Breast-deep in the sky’s reflection,
And all that icy trance
Breaks in most sweet destruction.
Stewart’s newest volume, “The
Flowering Place” (poems from 1962 to
1967), is outstanding for its group of
poems on the great nineteenth-century
travellers and scientists: Kingdon
Ward, Darwin, Audubon, Kinglake,
D’Albertis, Mungo Park. The verse
here is relaxed; sometimes discursive;
but Stewart’s characteristic mildness
and wit allow him to bring off some
wonderful effects, as in “B Flat,” the
poem about the Reverend Henry
White who found that owls “Sang, or
rather hooted,/Precisely in the measure
of B flat”:
So, softly, Muse, in harmony and
conformity
Pipe up for him and all such gentle
souls
Thus in the world’s enormousness,
enormity,
So interested in music and in owls;

Labyrinth
By ELWYN LYNN
The Hidden Order of Art, a Study in
the Psychology of Artistic Imagina-
tion. Anton Ehrenzweig. Weidenfeld
and Nicolson. $9.80.
THE HIDDEN ORDER of art remains
hidden in Anton Ehrenzweig’s last
attempt to examine the psychology of
the artist and of artistic activity; not
because of the vagueness that charac-
terised Herbert Read’s examination of
the opposition between intellectuality
and sensuous experience in his “The
Origins of Form in Art,” but because
of the intractability of notions of un-
conscious motives and especially of
what Ehrenzweig calls unconscious
scanning and structuring.
Ehrenzweig introduced this theory
in an essay in Gyorgy Kepes’ collection
of essays called “Education of Vision”;
this simple and very necessary intro-
duction is not mentioned in the present
book, which was prepared just before
Ehrenzweig’s death. He says that one
syncretistic way of knowing is by
unconscious scanning by knowing
without being conscious of the fact, just
as the skilled card-player “knows” what
others hold but at no point in the
game could give an exact account as
his game suggests he could.
The same process occurs with com-
posers, social observers who detect
trends without piles of statistics, and
with these art historians who can dis-
cern themes in an artist without being
mesmerised by an artist’s atypical
approaches.
All this is clear enough, but we are
in dark regions when Ehrenzweig tries
to formulate the exact processes of this
scanning; oddly enough he suggests that
we should read the book as children
listen to fairytales and take William
James’ “flying leaps”: “May I, then,
ask the reader not to be irritated by
the obscurity of some of the material,
to take out from the book what appeals
to him and leave the rest unread?”
The oddness seems odder still when
he asks us later to endure the accounts
of, for example, the manic, oral, and
anal origins of art. It’s a plea that
recalls McLuhan’s answer to critics
who say that they cannot follow the
“leaps” in his logic: that they are too
literate and should scan his books for
impressions . . . but both authors do
write what are commonly called books.
Ehrenzweig makes a telling attack
upon the Gestalt theory of perception
by simple shapes which are assumed to
be the basis of both perception and
aesthetics, because he says that un-
conscious scanning gives order to what
seems disconnected surface scattering of
images. What is new from a psycho-
analytic point of view is that he regards
the unconscious not as an anarchic war
of repressed forces but as having an
order of its own and a way of be-
haviour essential to the creation and,
perhaps, understanding of art.
His position takes its departure from
Melanie Klein’s theories of children’s
behaviour and she reads like a primer
compared with the complexity of Ehren-
zweig’s account of how art short-cir-
cuits processes between the various levels
from ego to oral, anal, manic, and
oceanic. The trouble is—and this is true
of so many accounts of creative activi-
ties by psychoanalysts—one never quite
grasps what is at work at these various
levels; but he does convince one that
the artist and the observer of artistic
works must always be ready to allow
unconscious motives to operate.
Ehrenzweig says that an artist who
puts down only what he intended will
deal in mannerisms and cliches; the
artist must indulge in some self-analysis
and introspection and be prepared to
allow others to find in his work what
he did not intend. This balance between
the intellectual and the intuitive is
exemplified in what he calls the fertile
motif that can move through all levels;
he takes as examples of it those myths
that deal with the dying, burned, and
devoured god and urges us to look at
Frazer’s “Golden Bough” again
He throws light on myths and prob-
lems in art, like the deaths of Cordelia
and Lear and why Antigone’s desire
to bury her brother was so important;
but to relate his comments on art to his
discussion on how mania and depression,
fantasies of self-creation, and the way
the artist contains creativity in his own
womb are basic to the production of
works of art is a tough task . . .
especially when he tosses in observations
about enclosing and isolating criminals
and the burial of the corpse, when, he
says, the human being comes closest
to excrement, and relates all these to
the health of society and to anal “scat-
tering.”
At times the book is enough to drive
you back to the womb, but is, incident-
ally, worth close study: he examines the
nature of abstract thinking, points out
that what looks abstract to us is con-
crete to the child, that the art teacher
will be alert to shifts between libidinous
withdrawal from the real world into
abstraction and that abstraction does

not necessarily involve a denial of emo-
tion.
Ehrenzweig warns, however, that
“Scientific abstraction differs from an
empty generalisation in the way in
which potent abstract art differs from
empty ornament” and that in art today
“emotional detachment from reality
has gone too far.” He emphasises that
though decadence into empty generali-
sations in thought and sterile abstrac-
tion in art may be due to ego dissocia-
tion, “The liveliness of abstract thought
derives from its rich substructure of
unconscious phantasy.”
He has much, too, to say about
spontaneity and how it solidifies into
mannerism, what the fragmentation of
the surface, so prounounced in modern
art, means in psychoanalytic terms,
what is involved in that übiquitous term
in art criticism, “ambiguity,” and how
anxious people cannot abide it. (I’ve
been told that people of an authori-
tarian cast of mind don’t even see
ambiguities.)
To get much from this book, artists,
and others, will certainly have to be
alert, especially if they are to grasp
Ehrenzweig’s complex notions of the
“undifferentiation” of unconscious
image-making, the conscious “dediffer-
entiation” of surface images and his
poemagogic theory.
Because Ehrenzweig has given equal
attention to “conscious” and “uncon-
scious” motives he has indicated a way
out of the blind alley that psycho-
analysis has led to when exploring
aesthetics, but it’s a labyrinthine exit.
Two Berlins
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Two Views. Uwe Johnson. Cape. $3.85.
UWE JOHNSON is one of Germany’s
outstanding young writers. Only 33, he
has already won two important awards,
the West Berlin “Fortune” Prize for
his first novel, “Speculations About
Jakob,” and the International Pub-
lishers’ Prize for “The Third Book
Uwe Johnson ... despair
About Achim” (English edition out
next year).
The “Two Views” of the title are
meant both politically and psychologi-
cally. The book deals not only with
the political scenery as observed first
from a window in the West of Berlin
and then from one in its Communist
East, but less obviously it also examines
two radically opposed views of life
together -- twin aspects typifying the
outlook of youth anywhere today.
On one side of the wall, in the
West, stands young newspaper photog-
rapher Dietbert, and on the other, in
the East, his girlfriend, the dedicated
hospital nurse Beate. The novel shows
these two striving to come together as
one, achieving the possibility after sur-
mounting incredible man-made bar-
riers, only to recognise in the end that
they have no genuine point of mental
contact at all.
Like the two Berlins, like the two
young Germans, the book chapters
come in pairs, always one from the
boy’s point of view and one from the
girl’s. Their fates run side by side like
parallel lines, but, significantly, never
succeed in converging. This is what,
on the surface, the novel is about.
On another, inner level, however, it
explores human hopelessness: with
Dietbert it becomes frenzied despair,
with Beate the resigned lethargy of no-
feeling that is far beyond despair. On
this level, the wall is only the symbol
(not the cause) of their disenchantment
and depression. It is a sign of human
non-relationship which too often takes
the place of the communication people
like to deceive themselves they are
experiencing.
Both are frustrated intelligences,
robbed of the outlet their minds and
energies crave. The East has prevented
Beate from studying, for political rea-
sons (her father was an officer in Hit-
ler’s army); the West has prevented
Dietbert from studying, for financial
reasons (his father had insufficient
money).
Dietbert’s only true passion, his
mother-father-lover, is his expensive,
flashy red sportscar on which, before
the story opens, he has spent his life
savings and mortgaged his future
salaries. This modern equivalent of a
knightly charger is the exotic extension
of his own image of himself, without
which he is merely half a man.
Its theft, one night, is a loss of self,
of personality; as it coincides with the
closing of the Berlin Wall and the con-
sequent inaccessibility of Beate, the two
losses become for him interchangeable.
He rushes off on crazy, unmotivated
plane journeys, pursuing something in-
tangible and at the same time fleeing
from it perhaps from his own alter
ego, perhaps from his unfocused view
of life itself. The narrative assumes the
quality of madness on both sides of
the barrier.
The original, rather perfunctory,
relationship between Beate and Diet-
bert takes on fantastic shapes and an
unrealistic importance through the en-
forced separation. At last Dietbert

stumbles on a cloak-and-dagger, people-
smuggling organisation through which
Beate is finally brought “across the
wall” on a Danish passport by ship
to Copenhagen and a plane back to
the West side of Berlin. In the same
time, he has bought a replacement car
and lands in hospital.
In the West, the girl recognises that
she wants nothing but the privacy she
was denied by law in the East. As the
story closes, the concussed boy has not
yet discovered that he wants only the
unattainable.
This is a remarkable novel. Judged
by the highest international yardstick,
it is perhaps not truly a great one (in
the sense of compatriot Grass’ “Tin
Drum”). However, the style is quite
personal flat, understated, very con-
temporary offering the illusion of
plain narration while being anything
but that. Its seemingly simply sentences
are deliberately deceptive. Born and
educated in the East but living in the
West since 1959, Uwe Johnson has
come a genuine voice for the often
inarticulate youth of our day.
Too much?
By NANCY KEESING
Billy Borker Yarns Again. Frank Hardy.
Nelson. $2.95.
Legends From Benson’s Valley. Frank
Hardy. Horwitz. $1.25.
SURELY BY NOW most Australians,
readers or television viewers, will know
what they think about Billy Borker and
his tall stories. They will either like
them or not and welcome this collection
or feel that there can be too much of
even a good thing.
In this book are twenty-seven further
yarns illustrated, inimitably, by Paul
Rigby. According to the blurb, “most
of the yarns are a little earthier, a
little saltier than before.” I’d say they
are a little coarser. Coarsened by city
streets, perhaps, or by being brought
so determinedly up to date. However,
if you like Borker, it is well worth
judging for yourself.
Benson’s Valley is the sort of coun-
try town from which Billy Borker may
well have sprung. I prefer its Depression
time adventures to Billy’s latter-day
pub crawl. These days Borker’s mates
“chunder.” I’d like to heat Darky’s
opinion of that effete word! You can
meet this splendid Australian in the
story called “The Load of Wood.”
“Legends from Benson’s Valley” is a
deceptively simple collection. The
stories are truly earthy of the earth
and salty, for their people are the
salt of the earth. Behind the tough,
casual presentation is a strong, sensitive
eye which is not too bleary to weep
real tears occasionally.

NOTES FROM LINDEMAN'S
CELLAR MANAGER:
The previous notes in this column
described Lindeman’s newly planted red
vineyard, “Limestone Ridge,” at Coona-
warra.
Since writing those notes a new prop-
erty has been purchased at Pokolbin in
the Hunter River Valley for planting
two red grape varieties.
Situated some three miles from “Ben
Ean,” the new 92-acre property is
dominated by a hill of the same soil
type as originally occurred at “Ben
Ean” - a rich chocolate brown vol-
canic loam over soft deep red clay.
Most of the balance of the property
is composed of a black sandy loam over
red clay, and both soil types are ideal
for red grape varieties.
Contouring of the property will com-
mence immediately and the first vines
- Red Hermitage and Pinot Noir
will be planted next year.
A start has been made on replanting
“Ben Ean” vineyards and this will be
carried out progressively over the next
ten years to avoid any significant loss
of crop in one year. With modern earth-
moving equipment the old vineyards can
be rejuvenated by filling in gullies and
contouring to prevent soil erosion by
heavy rain.
At “Sunshine” vineyard in the Hunter
River Valley substantial new areas of
white grapes are beginning to bear
crops assuring supply of Lindeman’s
Hunter River Dry Whites for many
years to come.

MASTER
Some blue chips
are now
distinctly red
FOUR YEARS AGO I mentioned the
investment value of wine and suggested
that The Bulletin’s Speculator could
well pay some attention to the subject,
too. The Mouton-Rothschild I was
being flippant about had doubled in
price in only two years I drank all
the profits but even then I didn’t
realise how perceptive my predictions
were. Otherwise I would have cornered
the market.
We all know how much the price of
quality table wine, red in particular,
has risen. Most of this is due to the
vastly increased consumption, because
more red is being made than ever
before. Output just can’t keep up.
Theoretically I’m not against these price
rises for quality material, since ours
has been a depressed industry for many
years and needed the boost. Person-
ally, it annoys hell out of me. The
production side of my income has not
kept up with the consumption, either.
Cellaring and the new enthusiasm
for it may have aggravated the posi-
tion. Buying five dozen of this and that
every so often must cause shortages if
there are enough people doing it. I
applaud them, for the wine companies
can no longer be expected to mature
wine for years, and most of our good
reds do need some bottle age. But
how many people are buying wine to
make money by resale?
Recently I sat next to a glib young
man who told me that he had pur-
chased 100 dozen in the past year and
had left the wine in cartons in his
garage. “In two years time it will be
worth twice what I paid for it.” He
didn’t even have the pleasure of walk-
ing around in his cellar. And another
bloke told me that he bought five dozen
of a recent Show release that cost
more than $2 a bottle before he even
tasted it. I suggested he may not like
it; I didn’t much. “That doesn’t
matter,” he said, “I’ve already been
offered 50 cents a bottle more for it.”
I hope this doesn’t sound like sour
grapes, but I am somewhat concerned
about this attitude.
Owning your own cellar is a worthy
wine ambition. The pleasure you can
get from it is enormous. To buy a wine
relatively cheaply, watch it get better
over the years, and then share it with
your friends is a consummation de-
voutly to be wished. But the whole
precious wine ideal is upset by those
who merely buy for profit.
Undoubtedly the profit is there. We
may even one day have a wine exchange.
The blue chip stocks of Cabernet would
probably be renamed red chip, there
would be keen speculation around the
Wine Post on the growth potential of
Traminer and' Gamay, releases that
don’t win awards would be issued at
par, whereas all show medal stocks
would be sold at a premium. I could
go on. I will. Bullish moods would de-
velop toward Rhine Rieslings and wines
from Coonawarra, bearish attitudes
taken to Doradillo and the future of
N.E. Victoria as a white wine area.
We could take options on wines in the
cask and sell short when we detected
a hint of volatility before anyone else.
Home bottlers would have their own
Kerb Exchange. I could even become
the first chartist wine merchant. And
with the nature of the product the
wine exchange would always “close on
a strong note.” And open rather weakly
in the morning.
Until it comes, I cannot understand
how the investors will profit other than
illegally. Only those licensed are sup-
posed to trade in wine, and, strictly
speaking, you can’t even sell wine back
to the licensee you bought it from.
Auctions are the only answer, and even
these are surrounded by technicalities
about licensed premises and deceased
estates.
Of course you can always flog it
surreptitiously. One of my great friends,
a noted wine-doctor (no jumped con-
clusions; I have several), a man whose
crusted exterior hides a heart of pure
Cabernet, is always boasting about the
value of his cellar and the money he
will make. “Bought it for four-and-six
a bottle. Worth $4 today. Make a for-
tune.” Yet, in the ten years I have
known him, I’ve only once heard of
him actually selling a bottle. And then
he didn’t get paid for it. It’s been on
his conscience ever since.
Frankly, I hope that these specula-
tors will be seduced by the heady fumes
of the product they hope to profit from.
There is greater pleasure in wine than
money. Even speculators must have
some interest. I feel this will develop
with their wine. And when the day
comes for the sale of a dozen matured
Hunter Reds of a good year, it will be
like “Clarissa, come back! I don’t care
what my mother says! I LOVE you.”
This ieads me to another investment
recommendation. Wines are becoming
more and more costly. Bargains there
still are, but they are harder to find.
There are so many people hunting
for wines.
So forget the wines and concentrate
on the people. I may even make people
recommendations in my column: “So-
and-so has a charming cellar in Pymble
and enjoys friends popping in Sunday
afternoon.” “When visiting Adelaide,
bump into X and mention you’ve never
tasted an old McLaren Vale.”
It’s all too simple. Invest in friends.

LETTERS
Denial from the DLP
In case anyone should believe the
article “DLP Second Stage” (8., Aug-
ust 26) was an accurate account of
what happened at the Victorian DLP
Conference, I would like to point out
that almost every paragraph contained
either wrong information or incorrect
interpretation of this particular debate.
Since there is no truth whatsoever
in the correspondent’s statement that,
support for the so-called DLP “Third
Party Policy comes from the strong
Western District branches,” the Wan-
non Federal Electorate Council of the
DLP carried the following resolution
at its last meeting:
“That Wannon Federal Council of
the DLP refutes any inference that it
is engaged in the construction of a
Third Party. It reiterates that its inten-
tion is to unite the non-Communist
forces of Labor and rebuild the Aus-
tralian Labor Party into a Party which
can regain the confidence of the
majority of the Australian people.”
P. F. Goggin
Warrnambool, Vic.
And from Robert Hughes
April McKee-Wright might at least
get some details straight. I was sur-
prised on reading her profile of me
(8., Sept. 23) that the “Observer” and
the “Sunday Times” send me to Greece
for weekends (I have never done an
overseas assignment for either journal,
and never been to Greece in my life),
that I am a “constant panellist” on a
TV programme which I chaired and
which finished 15 months ago, and so
on.
But what I do resent is her way of
quoting things I neither said nor think.
I did not say that “no writer in his
senses” would stay in Australia. Such
an idea is arrogant absurdity. I said
that no freelance journalist, such as
myself, ought to stay if he got the
chance to work in England or the
States.
Nor did I say that “I couldn’t think
of going back to Australia, even for a
visit.” What I actually told McKee-
Wright was that, given my present
obligations to British publishers for
books on European art, I couldn’t go
back to Australia except for a visit.
I am curious to know why your reporter
switched a statement of fact into a
spit of contempt. Does she think I can
airfreight the British Museum Read-
ing Room, the libraries and files of
the Courtauld and Warburg Institutes,
and about a hundred museums and
churches to Sydney, in order to gratify
my sense of place whilst writing a
book on the imagery of Heaven and
Hell in Western art? If your subject
is Australian art, you stay in Australia.
If it is European art, you do not.
Perhaps it was inevitable that, hav-
ing accused me of a disgust with Aus-
tralia which I do not feel, she should
then credit me with a raving Anglo-
philia which I have never experienced.

Anger from the A.C.T.
Wonderful to see such deep human
perception on the part of Military
Correspondent (8., Sept. 9). How very
clever of him to see we are in Vietnam
not for any time-worn reason of “re-
taining China,” “halting the yellow
deluge,” but just for practice.
Think of the marvellous exercise our
troops would get if we could provoke
China into a guerilla war by staying
in Vietnam. Or perhaps he would rather
Indonesia—no matter, it’s not who you
play, it’s the way that you play it.

Tasmania's lost valleys
Comments on the Tasmanian power
crisis (8., Sept. 23) shows why Tas-
mania should limit its hydro-electric
development in favor of some stations
which can be supplied by more pre-
dictable energy sources.
As Melbourne residents know by their
current water restrictions likely to
become more harsh the dry spell is
common to a large area of south-
eastern Australia. Indeed, the whole of
Tasmania is not a large enough area
to always have a high catchment
somewhere receiving enough water for
a dependable power supply.
It is Tasmanian Government policy
to expand secondary industry by the
maximum supply of hydro-electric
power, and so use up whatever water
supplies are controlled. It would be
contrary to this policy to keep vast
quantities of water in reserve.
In this light it is unforgivable that
the Tasmanian Government encourages
and expects or even allows the
HEC to draw up and go ahead with
plans to flood all possible valleys for
hydro-electric storages and pressure-
heads.
The days of hydro-electricity develop-
ment as the cheapest (?) source of
power are numbered, but it will be
replaced. The valleys flooded for this
“development” cannot be replaced. The
Australian population of the future
will need these areas. Will they be
there?
