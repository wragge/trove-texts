WRITERS OF QUEENSLAND
By CECIL HADGRAFT
I.
When Morris Miller, in his Aus-
tralian Literature, dealt with the
problem—Who are Australian authors?
-—he took three pages and left the
question open. When J. H. Hornibrook
compiled his Bibliography of Queens-
land Verse he was briefer: in one line
he claimed for Queensland those who
had lived in the State for two years or
more. This was arbitrary, but at least
it was definite. As things are, anyone
discussing literature by Queenslanders
or about Queensland may be reduced
sometimes to thinking a few months
enough to establish domicile.
Without the bitter social divisions
of the mother colony, Queensland pro-
duced writers from the start. In 1859,
the year of Separation, Charles
Frederick Chubb, a eupeptic lawyer
from England, issued a pamphlet at
Ipswich, Ode to Sir George Ferguson
Bowen, the State’s first Governor. In
the first decade appeared the first
volume of verse, Thomas Beaton
Hutchison Christie’s Poems and Songs,
to be followed a few months later by
William Anderson Forbes’s Voices
From the Bush. The first of the native-
born was George Vowles, with Sun-
beams in Queensland (1870).
These are minimi rather than
minors, to be noted only for their early
start. But they strike a note that is
echoed for some years. Roughly, when
the bush or the pioneer area is the
theme, then the verse is gloomy;
Forbes, for instance, endures grimly.
The town is a more cheerful theme:
Chubb, busy in the social round, is an
optimistic commentator.
This is borne out by Philip Lorimer,
an oddity among wandering minstrels,
who covered some thousands of miles
on foot after leaving Queensland for
the south, and who knew and hated
the Gulf country: —
Queensland, thou art a land of pest
From flies and fleas we ne’er can
rest —
a comic diatribe written in 1867 on
Bowen Downs. And Ernest Favenc,
Thomas Urquhart and Arthur Bayldon
are no more in love with the outback.
Only Mary Hannay Foott has the sense
of the beckoning horizon (Where the
Pelican Builds), and it is not until
about the 1920’s that Vance Palmer
feels at home—
Brown, passionate land of mine—
and sees the men as products of the
country and himself bound to them.
Even the robust Bush Ballad torrent
of the late ’eighties and ’nineties and
the early years of this century was
swelled by only a mere trickle from
Queensland. There were Queensland
ballads in some newspapers, there were
a few in some volumes of verse, but
to the best of my knowledge no
Queensland poet in that period wrote
a book wholly or mainly of ballads—
Lex McLennan was of course much
later.
The years from the 1870’s to the
end of the century were occupied by
what can be called public poets—
commentators, prophets, preachers,
tocsins. These are the best of our
earlier writers as well as the most
public-spirited. Francis Adams and
Brunton Stephens and Essex Evans had
their message, and they delivered it
generally in ringing if not very subtle
tones —the duty to commemorate
leaders and heroes, the need to pay
homage to sacrifice, the urgency of
Federation, the task ahead. They
served a function, then, and it is
doubtful whether even our own more
sceptical and stringent criteria of poetry
will allow them to be forgotten.
Later commentators like William
Baylebridge. preaching a new society
(was it Fascist or Communist? was he
Vitalist or Nietzschean?). John Mani-
fold, wry and acid (There's something
rotten . . .), finding occasional hope in
the individual example, Laurence
Collinson, more amused than angry,
concerned with persons rather than
causes —these are more sophisticated,
and we feel perhaps they probe deeper
or more subtly. Do they answer a need
felt as much? Is the response as
enthusiastic? It is hard to say, and
perhaps it is irrelevant; for it concerns
beliefs rather than poetry.
The wide Queensland land has made
its poets selective. Description began
with pictures of the Brisbane River,
then it gave us the west, the north,
the coast. And within these liberal
areas it sometimes settled on a spot
that a pencil-point could cover on a
map.
Indeed, though some of the women
writers such as M. Forrest, Llewelyn
Lucas and E. M. England travelled
out into romantic territories, most of
our best descriptive verse has been
local or regional. Favenc knew and
mistrusted the desert, Bayldon hated
the outback track, James Picot
(erratic, feckless, gifted, dying young)
had a hawk’s eye for some aspects of
the Darling Downs, Clem Christesen
caught moments of the north and
south coast, Val Vallis made nearly
tangible the Gladstone area. David
Rowbotham almost created a legendary
background for the Downs, and in his
pictures of interiors has given us his
best poems.
Others have owed a more general
debt to the enormous and enormously
varied Queensland scene Brian
Vrepont, a singer of earth and the
poet’s response to it, a priest of nature
with an intense awareness of man’s
debt; Paul Grano, searching for “an
illumination, a flow of grace,”
conscious of the inadequacy of his own
expression, but catching something of
the elusive spirit.
Others like Martin Haley and John
Blight have transmuted these influences
into wit or an esoteric response.
The lyric has, of course, always
flourished. (The former classifications
are at best makeshift conveniences.)
Two poets have been especially con-
cerned with the inner life. The volumes
of James Devaney have traced —some-
times perhaps unconsciously - the
development of a poet’s beliefs, his
loss of faith, his worship of nature,
his gain in spiritual resources. The
other, our greatest poet by far. perhaps
the greatest in Australian literature
after Brennan, is Judith Wright.
Enough has been written of her art to
render futile any potted comment here;
but one may note that into the last
three volumes of her verse—whether
descriptive, lyric or reflective—parts of

READING THOMAS TRAHERNE
Can I so lose myself,
and losing find one word
that in the face of what von were
dares to be said or heard?
Or speak of what has come
to your sad race,
that on your clear rejoicing
we look with such a face? —
with such a face, Traherne,
as might make dumb
any but you, the man who knew
how strangely truth may come—
who saw the deepest darkness
shake, part and move,
and from its centre the light's ladder
reach up from love to Love.

A COMMUNICATIONS
MONOPOLY?
A NY praise that Mr. Holt might have
earned for the sober realism of
parts of his Budget has now been lost
in the cries of protest from the
maimed and the injured who have been
hit by his increased post-office and
telephone charges.
Mr. Holt seemed to be inclined to
treat these lightly; and, after all, they
involve in the aggregate the addition
of only £17.8 million to the huge pile
of Federal revenue—millions being like
pennies to Federal Treasurers in these
expansive days—but they are a woeful
burden to productive industry.
Mr. Holt calls the G.P.O. that
“highly competent organisation, effici-
ently managed, devoted to the service
of the public, progressive in outlook,
eager to meet the ever-increasing
demands upon it for wider and better
facilities.”
It has. in fact, made a merit of
necessity and is now piling onto the
shoulders of the taxpayers in solid
lumps costs for work that should have
been put in hand years ago: work that
is being done in a hurry with the
consequent natural inflation of
charges.
The one thing of which the G.P.O.
(like the A.8.C.) seems to have made a
“notable success,” as advertised by Mr.
Holt, is in spending money.
Mr. Holt says that since 1945 the
Government has provided some £4OO
million for new buildings and equip-
ment, and each year the “requirement
has tended to grow” and has “been
provided from the Budget” and “not
borrowed.”
In other words, the payments for
capital - improvements have been
extracted from post-office customers
and telephone-users (as well as the
general taxpayer) every year, with little
or no recourse to loan-money because
it has “not been available.”
What is even more remarkable is
the apparent lack of awareness of
Ministers hitherto . of the urgency
which has driven Mr. Holt to drastic
measures.
nrHE fact is that since 1954-55 expen-
diture outside capital works and
services has nudged up from the region
of £76 million a year to a proposed
£lO9 million this year—when a
surplus of £lO million is forecast. But
efficiency does not seem to have nudged
up with it. It is still quicker to send
a horseman with a telegram to the
suburbs of Sydney in the weekend than
to send a telegram at ordinary rates,
and there is a good deal to be desired
all round in the celerity and reliability
of delivery of postal articles.
There seems to be little attempt to
cut the coat of the G.P.O. to suit a
reasonable charge for services. The
job is just done without much' regard
for economy—as proved by the depart-
ment’s lack of knowledge even of what
its capital is.
Charges are fitted to meet the need
of the day, whether that need is inflated
by loaf and sabotage, by squander or
dilatoriness which eventually produce
the need to pay overtime wages in
large lumps on work and materials for
projects that have become vitally
urgent.
The basic postal-rates have grown
steadily with the inflation of Post
Office business. The G.P.O. is one
business-concern in which the rule
“volume for cheapness” does not
apply.
In 1911 penny - postage ruled
throughout the British Dominions, and
it was not till October, 1918, that it
was found necessary to impose a
war-tax in the Commonwealth.
Two years later the tax was taken
off, but postage was raised to 2d. It
fell to in 1923, and went back to
2d. in 1930. In 1940 a war-tax
was again added, and was made per-
manent in July, 1949. In 1950 postage
went to 3d., in 1951 to and in
October, 1956, to 4d.
Now establishing 5d., with the
amazing range of concomitant news-
paper and commercial rates to match,
Mr. Holt (or Mr. Davidson) has broken
the record and achieved fame as the
implementer of the highest postal-rate
in the civilised world.
The vertical lift in bulk-postage rates
on newspapers and periodicals to
around double their previous level is
likely to prove a mortal blow to many
independent journals of opinion and of
literary, artistic, entertainment and
cultural value throughout the Com-
monwealth.
With the Menzies Government hav-
ing already granted the majority of
city TV licences to existing metropoli-
tan daily-newspaper and radio interests
through their captive subsidiary or
associated companies, a near-monopoly
in communications is being developed
in which the Melbourne “Herald.” the
“Sydney Morning Herald” and Packer’s
Consolidated Press (Sydney) will share
most of such separate control as now
exists.
The Australian public is already
being served a sort of sausage-machine
type of news and TV and radio enter-
tainment, and although the Australian
Broadcasting Commission is inde-
pendent of the main press-radio-TV
monoliths, it in itself is a chain-store
type of service, controlled by one
authority but distributing its news and
entertainment over a wide network,
localised in particular cases, certainly,
but still under the one control.
A GAINST competition of this type
the independent publishers have
been battling for a number of years,
and it is quite clear that some big com-
bines would like to see them completely
annihilated. In Sydney daily-paper
journalism the independent critic is
not appreciated any more than demo-
cratic processes are appreciated. Most
press-tsars develop a type of megalo-
mania that tolerates no criticism and
aims at government-by-newspaper.
The daily press in Sydney has raised
little outcry against the crippling
increase in bulk postages for this
reason. Metropolitan dailies are com-
paratively little affected. And it has
been part of a general policy of Sydney
dailies Often to agree to an impost so
long as it will put the other fellow out
of business.
The attitude of the Menzies Gov-
ernment in this matter of postal
charges is curious. It is prepared, on
the one hand, to raise bulk-postage on
independent periodicals by almost 100
p.c. in one hit, and at the same time
to subsidise the operations of the Aus-
tralian Broadcasting Commission to
the tune of £2,041,000 a year (1957-58),
with a preliminary estimate of
£2,400,000 for 1958-59.
This in spite of the fact that the
A.B.C. collects £2 15s. a year in licence-
fees from radio-listeners and £5 a year
from televiewers, the total now reach-
ing over £8 million a year.
With no newsprint to pay for and no
postages involved in communicating
with its listeners and viewers, the
A.B.C. was nevertheless £500,000 in
the red on current expenditure alone
for 1957-58, and £2 million to the bad
when capital-works paid for out of
revenue are taken into account.
Odd, indeed, that with such a
revenue at its disposal, and still unable
to pay its way. the A.B.C. should be
subsidised without question, while the
independent taxpaying periodical press
is slugged 100 p.c. more in postage-
rates in one act in order to help make-
up the deficiencies of Government
“business undertakings.”

Threat to India
The position in India becomes more and
more strained as events following the
removal of the Kerala Government
develop and refugees pour in from Tibet
with news of Communist activities.
The Communist pressure is definitely
southward. Nehru announced a few
days ago that over 12,000 refugees had
survived the journey across the Hima-
layas, and “the chance of their returning
to Tibet in the foreseeable future is
small.”
Indian nationals in Tibet have been
isolated and are being refused the right
to consult with the Indian Consul-
General in Lhasa despite repeated pro-
tests to the Peking Government from
Delhi.
Many Indians or persons of Indian
blood have tried to register in the
Tibetan capital as Indian citizens. The
only reply from Peking has been that
“these persons have been residing in
Tibet for a long period and are to all
intents and purposes therefore Chinese
citizens” —a complete negation of inter-
national law to which, of course, mem-
bers of the United Nations normally
profess to subscribe, but which China
appears to ignore.
Following this incident, Nepal took
fright and its Prime Minister announced
that events in Tibet had “an inescapable
bearing on Nepal’s defence-pattern and
Budget,” defence provision being
increased in the estimates by 14 per cent.
Before the Tibetan incidents, the P.M.
said, Nepal did not take her northern
border-defence seriously; but now a
steady infiltration from Tibet has been
taking place with a view to Red-anting
defences, and the border-posts have been
placed on alert.
The ground for the uneasiness was clear
when it was discovered in Delhi that a
large section of Northern India appeared
on Chinese maps as part of Red China —
just as a few years ago the China Seas
right up to the coast of the Philippines
were similarly annexed by Peking map-
makers.
Nehru has declared that he has no
information about the alleged statements
of Chinese leaders in Tibet or about
the border troop-concentrations, but he
said that there were large Chinese forces
in Tibet.
He announced that the Indian Gov-
ernment had protested to Peking about
Chinese propaganda in which India and
Indians were described as “imperialists.”
He said that the McMahon Line, which
defined the . Indian border, still stood,
but a member recalled a speech in which
Chou En-lai had referred to the “unde-
fined borders of certain countries,” and
wanted to know whether this referred to
India. Mr. Nehru “thought” that Chou
En-lai had accepted the McMahon Line,
which he himself said was a frontier
“firm by treaty, usage, right and
geography.”
But there is no doubt the little
Buddhist States along the Tibetan
border are frightened, and have good
cause to be. At present India couldn’t
defend itself without help, and other
countries couldn’t defend it without
starting another war like the Korean one
—or worse.
The Mt. Isa Railway
[From Canberra]
The Commonwealth Government is plan-
ning to make a last-dice throw at the
International Bank for a loan for the
Isa-Townsville railway-construction job.
Having been unable to convince the
bank of the need for a loan —on the
bank’s pretty strict terms —P.M. Menzies
has now decided to let Harold Holt have
a go at it. Holt will leave Australia
early next month to attend a conference
of Commonwealth Finance Ministers in
London, commencing September 22.
From there he will go to Washington
for meetings of the International Bank
and International Monetary Fund, and
undoubtedly will whisper in the ear of
Mr. Menzies’s erstwhile friend, bank-
president Eugene Black.
He will have to whisper a little harder
than Menzies himself did if he is to
achieve any results.
Holt’s Man Friday, Treasury Secretary
Roland Wilson, is already in Washington
to negotiate Government loans, and he
might sound-out Black before Holt
arrives.
The World Bank is understood to be
prepared to modify its terms if the Mt.
Isa Co. agrees to 85 per cent, amortisa-
tion of the loan over 25 years, with re-
payments coming from railway freights
Song of the Artesian Water
Now the stock have started dying, for the
Lord has sent a drought;
But we’-re sick of prayers and Providence
— we’re going to do without;
With the derricks up above us and the
solid earth below,
We are waiting at the lever for the word
to let her go.
Sinking down, deeper down ;
Oh, we’ll sink it deeper down.
As the drill is plugging downward at a
thousand-feet of level,
If the Lord won’t send us water, oh, we’ll
get it from the devil;
Yes, we’ll get it from the devil deeper
down.
Now, our engine’s built in Glasgow by
a very canny Scot,
And he marked it twenty horsepower,
but he don’t know what is what.
When Canadian Bill is firing with the
sun-dried gidgee logs,
She can equal thirty horses and a score
or so of dogs.
Sinking down, deeper down ;
Oh, we’re going deeper down.
If we fail to get the water then it’s ruin
to the squatter,
For the drought is on the station and the
weather’s growing hotter,
But we’re bound to get the water deeper
down.
But the shaft has started caving and Jhe
sinking’s very slow,
And the yellow rods are bending in the
water down below,
And the tubes are always jamming and
they can’t be made to shift
Till we nearly burst the engine with a
forty-horsepower lift.
Sinking down, deeper down ;
Oh, were going deeper down.
Though the shaft is always caving, and
the tubes are always jamming,
Yet we’ll fight our way to water while
the stubborn drill is ramming —
While the stubborn drill is ramming
deeper down.
But there’s no artesian water, though
we’ve passed three-thousand feet,
And the contract price is growing and the
boss is nearly beat.
But is must be down beneath us, and
it’s down we’ve got to go,
Though she’s bumping on the solid rock
four-thousand feet below.
Sinking down, deeper down ;
Oh, we’re going deeper down,
And it’s time they heard us knocking on
the roof of Satan’s dwellin’;
But we’ll get artesian water if we cave
the roof of hell in —
Oh ! we’ll get artesian water deeper down.
But it’s hark ! the whistle’s blowing with
a wild, exultant blast,
And the boys are madly cheering, for
they’ve struck the flow at last,
And it’s rushing up the tubing from four-
thousand feet below
Till it spouts above the casing in a
million-gallon flow.
And it’s down, deeper down —
Oh, it comes from deeper down ;
It is flowing, ever flowing, in a free,
unstinted measure
From the silent hidden places where the
old earth hides her treasure —
Where the old earth hides her treasure
deeper down.
And it’s clear away the timber, and it’s
let the water run :
How it glimmers in the shadow, how it
flashes in the sun !
By the silent belts of timber, by the miles
of blazing plain
It is bringing hope and comfort to the
thirsty land again.
Flowing down, further down ;
It is flowing further down
To the tortured thirsty cattle, bringing
gladness in its going;
Through the droughty days of summer
it is flowing, ever flowing —
It is flowing, ever flowing, further down.
1896.

won on the carriage of lead and zinc from
the mine to Townsville.
It has been reported, although without
official confirmation as yet, that if Holt
fails at the World Bank he might try
Wall Street.
If he gets a loan from there, it’s dollars
to doughnuts the terms will be stiffer
than anything Eugene Black can think-
up.
Teachers 1 Week
Education Week, which is held periodi-
cally in Victoria, must be classed as
another success, schoolteachers of all
grades since the war having become,
appropriately enough, the most articulate
of the professions about their wants and
ambitions and have now learned the
value of public-relations.
There was little room for doubt that
the programme of the week was framed
by and for teachers. Its chief selling-
points were the small amount spent on
education in Australia in comparison
with other selected countries, the large
number of children who quit school at
15 or 16 —this was the fault of the parents
and the children —and the need for
longer school-holidays, for the benefit
chiefly of teachers, not the scholars.
Had parents of school-age children had
some voice in framing the events and
speakers for Education Week, there
would doubtless have been discussion
on the enormous increases in private-
school fees, trivial changes made in text-
books which were then reissued at con-
tinually increasing cost, the long summer,
May and September holidays enjoyed
by teachers and no other professional
adults, and the discouragement of longer
school-lives to those children who fail
to pass examinations but simply desire
to be educated.
The most stimulating discussion was
not in the official schedule but a mere
teenage debate on TV about whether our
education system provides a proper
cultural basis for living, with the young-
sters making the points that most Aus-
tralians are not educated to appreciate
culture, are suspicious of the creative or
original thinker, and few artists can make
a living in their own country.
It is true that this is the age of the soap-
opera, Westerns, the pulp-magazines,
horror-films, cheap novels, soppy music,
comics-reading and the rest. This defines
the need for more education, but it also
reflects on the past, suggesting that it has
been illiberal and intolerant of the
humanities, and forbiddingly academic.
This Freedom!
The adventures of the suburban Sydney
poultry-raiser who was fined the other day
could scarcely have happened anywhere
this side of Russia ; and if the basic
events had taken place outside the range
of that curious institution, the N.S.W. Egg
Board, it is doubtful if anything would
have been heard of it in a court.
The gist of the story was that a citizen
who intended to begin selling eggs found
From THE BULLETIN Black-and-white Gallery
(A footnote to the issue of July 18, 1896, described this as "The
Queensland water-bag frog—a story dealt-out to newchums.”)
in the preliminary stages that he had not
enough to make a profit out of, so he
gave them away to his mother and
neighbors. The Egg Board heard about
the outrage and promptly prosecuted him.
The magistrate turned a sour face
towards the Egg Board panjandrums and
said that he thought the egg-producer’s
behavioi had been praiseworthy, but that
nevertheless he must by law fine him 11s.
The probability is that not much will
be beard of this in Parliament, at any
rate on an effective scale, from the lovers
of free enterprise on the Opposition
benches. The preposterous law under
which the prosecution was brought is a
device for enabling the prices of food
produced in the country to be kept at top
level through bureaucratic control.
In a developmental economy the
primary producer needs to be protected
to keep h’im on the land, but in the kind
of economy that rules today there is no
reason for this sort of thing save that it
keeps large numbers of bureaucrats in
office working at variance with every
principle of liberty and against the in-
tention of the Constitution and natural
economic laws.
N. S. Wales in particular has more law
controlling the making and sale of comes-
tibles than perhaps any other English-
speaking area in the world. Yet it has
the worst bread-supply and the dearest
fish, milk—and eggs.
"I Told You So"
[From Canberra]
Postmaster-general Charlie Davidson
could be well pardoned if he said to
Prime Minister Menzies and Treasurer
Holt last week, “I told you so.”
He could also say it—and get away
with it —to his own party-chief, Trade
Minister John McEwen.
For Davidson’s was the lone voice in
the Cabinet crying-out against the
exorbitant increase in postal charges,
particularly for the bulk-postage of news-
papers and packages.
The Big Three—Menzies, Holt and
McEwen —told him in Cabinet that his
fears were unfounded.
But not only did the electorate not
accept the new charges—members of
McEwen’s own party raised their voice
loudest in protest.
They demanded, and got, a special
meeting with Menzies, and told him they
would not vote for the increased charges
on newspapers and magazines.
They claimed the new rates would
force many small country newspapers,
church-magazines, union-journals and the
like out of business.
Menzies realised the Country-party
boys were serious, while McEwen was
shocked at the strength of feeling in his
own party, which he previously con-
sidered he had gauged pretty well.
At a hastily-summoned Cabinet-meet-
ing on Thursday morning it was agreed
to make some modification (still very
limited) of the new rates on newspapers,
etc., and the P.M. announced it in grand
style to an expectant House on Thursday
night (the information having handily
leaked-out during the day).
In his announcement Mr. Menzies said,
in part: “I think we were all a little in
the dark on this subject until very broad
representations were made to us.”
His Cabinet still seems to be in the
dark (not to say clueless) so far as the
broad incidence of the new (still-standing)
bulk-postage charges are concerned.

he would lose money! He quickly

Theatre in Pitt Street, Sydney, about 1905.
They played “High Jinks,” “Hoity-Toity,”
“A Little Bit of Fluff,” and “Fiddle-de-

booked-in at a city hotel and asked the
clerk to give him a room as far away as
possible from the street noises. The bell-
boy took Plimmer to a room far back on
the fifth floor. Plimmer took the carafe
off the washstand and, giving it to the
boy, told him to get him some iced water.
Then the old trouper examined the bed
and found an empty brandy bottle, and
under the pillow, a lady’s nightdress. The
boy came back with the iced water.
Plimmer gave him the bottle and the
nightdress. “Boy,” he said, “take these
away and fill ’em.” —“Elanora.”

QUEENSLAND—
Awakened Qiant of the Worth
Queensland, which forms
the vast north-eastern
corner (22 per cent.) of
the Australian contin-
ent, with an area of 667,000
square-miles, is the youngest
of the States of the Common-
wealth. Its development over
the' hundred years since self-
government was achieved in
1859 furnishes an outstanding
example of successful white
colonisation and settlement in
a tropical and sub-tropical
environment. In many respects
it still is a frontier land with
largely undeveloped resources
holding promise of an eco-
nomic potential eclipsing any
other Australian State.
After several years of agita-
tion for separation from the
parent colony of New South
Wales, Queen Victoria in
Council on June 6, 1859,
adopted Letters Patent erect-
ing Moreton Bay into a colony
under the name of Queens-
land, the name chosen by
Queen Victoria. The new
colony came into existence on
December 10, 1859, when the
first Governor, Sir George
Ferguson Bowen, assumed
office. It had a population of
under 24,000, fewer than 6000
being located in the capital.
There were throughout the
colony little more than 3000
acres of farming land under
cultivation, but there were
nearly - million sheep,
500,000 cattle and 24,000
horses. Wool was the chief
export of the colony, but the
1860 clip totalled only five-
million lb. valued at £444,000.
The squatters, on the authority
of a statistical report of 1860,
were “the only productive
interest in the colony”; they
contributed 70 per cent of the
revenue and almost 94 per
cent, of the exports. Includ-
ing the newly proclaimed
pastoral districts of Kennedy
and Mitchell, the squatters
occupied 25-million acres.
The Foundations Are Laid
Development was quickened
by self-government. Early land
legislation by the Herbert
Government stimulated settle-
ment. Squatters moved out to
new frontiers in the Central,
North, and Far West. Before
1864, stations had been formed
and stock were grazing in
country beyond Mitchell’s
Victoria River and Kennedy’s
Thomson, in the western
interior. In a few years stock
had reached the South Aus-
tralian border and the waters
of the Gulf.
There was corresponding
activity in the coastal settle-
ments. The sugar industry was
By Frank Nicklin
Premier of Queensland
fostered by liberal concessions
in respect of land for sugar-
cultivation. The American
Civil War (1861-1865), by
creating a cotton famine in
Lancashire, gave an impetus
to cotton-growing in Queens-
land, which was enhanced by
the grant of bonuses on
the export of the fibre.
Immigrants poured into
Queensland; from January,
1860, to September, 1865,
about 38,000 new settlers
arrived in Queensland. Rail-
way-construction began; the
first section of 21 miles of
railway from Ipswich to
Bigge’s Camp (now Grand-
chester) was opened for traffic
on July 31, 1865.
The young colony seemed
fairly launched on an era of
prosperity. Then its economic
foundations were shaken by
the great financial crisis of
1866, which gripped the
Mother Country as well as
the Australian colonies. Rail-
way-construction and all other
public works in Queensland
ceased, unemployed men
walked the streets, and serious
riots occurred.
Discovery of the Gympie
goldfield by James Nash in
1867 changed a dismal
economic picture to one of
hope and prosperity. There
was a great revival of business
and trade, and a boom in land-
settlement. Under the Land
Act of 1868, which provided
©sHMaaias?
From The Bulletin Black-and-white Gallery —
Ruby Lindsay—1911
for a new tenure for settlers
who were half farmers and
half graziers, immense areas
were taken up. In 1869 a
Pastoral Leases Act was passed
granting leases in the unsettled
districts for any term not
exceeding 21 years to appli-
cants who had taken-up areas
and stocked them to the extent
of 25 sheep or five cattle to the
square-mile. In a few years
the entire western territory,
except where absence of water
forbade settlement, was par-
celled out in sheep- and cattle-
runs. It had not been recog-
nised that even country appar-
ently destitute of surface-water
could be utilised. In after
years, when the abundant
underground supplies of the
Great Artesian Basin were
tapped, these neglected ‘desert’
regions carried prosperous
sheep-runs.
Wealth From Gully and
Lode
Mining yielded its treasure.
The year after the discovery
of Gympie, a goldfield was
discovered at Ravenswood,
followed in steady succession
by Charters Towers, the Cape
River, the Palmer —a field of
enormous alluvial wealth, gold
pouring into Cooktown by the
ton —the Gilbert, the Etheridge,
the Hodgkinson, the Croydon,
and many others. In the
Herberton country, tin was
discovered in lodes as well as
in alluvial. At and around
Chillagoe, great lodes, minera-
lised with copper, silver and
lead, were found; and at
Cloncurry in the Gulf country,
the earliest squatting pioneers
found themselves confronted
with hills impregnated with
copper ores. Discovery of
Mount Morgan, the famous
‘Mountain of Gold’, in 1882
was an epoch-making event in
the history of Queensland gold-
mining.
In 1871 there were 9580
acres under sugar-cane, pro-
ducing 3762 tons of sugar. The
industry expanded so rapidly
that ten years later the area
under cane had increased to
more than 28,000 acres, and
103 mills were operating.
From the ’sixties until after
the turn of the century the
sugar - industry was almost
entirely carried-on by inden-
tured kanaka labor intro-
duced from the South Sea


Islands. Throughout its history,
until Federation resolved the
issue by repatriating the
Islanders, the kanaka question
was a major subject of political
controversy.
By 1870 Queensland’s popu-
lation was over 100,000. There
were more than a million cattle
and eight-million sheep, which
produced in that year more
than 38|-million lb. of wool
valued at more than £1 million.
By 1875 gold was worth more
than £1 million and copper-
production amounted to
£86,000.
Milestones of Progress
Great advances were made
in education. The Ministry of
Charles Lilley (later Sir Charles
Lilley and Chief Justice of
Queensland) was notable for
the inauguration of free educa-
tion. The celebrated Education
Act of 1875, which laid the
foundation of present educa-
tional policy, was the work of
Mr. Samuel (later Sir Samuel)
Griffith, Queensland’s first
Minister for Public Instruction,
in Arthur Macalister’s third
Ministry. This measure pro-
vided that the whole system
of education in Queensland
formerly administered by a
Board of General Education
should be transferred to a
department of the Public
Service, to be called the Depart-
ment of Public Instruction.
A spectacular episode in
Queensland’s history was the
annexation of New Guinea in
1883 by Queensland’s Premier,
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith.
Although Britain at first
disavowed Mcllwraith’s action,
his statesmanship and vision
were ultimately vindicated.
On June 8, 1888, the territory
which later became Papua was
formally annexed as a British
possession. As a result Aus-
tralia gained a firm foothold
in New Guinea, which proved
to be of vital importance to its
security in both World Wars.
The period 1880 to 1900
marked important milestones of
social and economic progress.
In February, 1880, the first
cargo of frozen meat reached
London by the Strathleven. In
October, 1885, the first direct
shipment of sugar, 94 tons, was
sent from Pioneer Plantation,
North Queensland, to London
in the steamer Merkara. By
January, 1888, the first through
passenger-trains were running
between Brisbane and Sydney.
The first Brisbane wool-sales
were held in October, 1891. By
1900 there were more than 2000
factories in Queensland, which
had a population of almost
500,000, about one-fifth of
whom lived in the capital.
Closer Settlement Brings
Wealth
Sugar was grown from
Nerang in the South to Moss-
man in the Far North, and the
colony’s 58 sugar-mills manu-
factured over 90,000 tons of
sugar in 1900-1901. In the
same year more than a million
bushels of wheat was harvested
from nearly 80,000 acres. More
than 450,000 acres were under
crops, and there were over
four-million cattle and more
than 10-million sheep. Wheat,
maize and lucerne were oust-

POLITICAL POINTS
Treasurer Holt has said that a com-
mittee is to be appointed to ascertain
the true capitalisation of the Post Office
and report upon the basis on which its
commercial accounts should be prepared.
It will be the depth of political hypocrisy
if it is decided to capitalise the £4OO
million which users of P.M.G. services
and the general taxpayer have overpaid
since 1945 in order to finance capital-
expenditure out of revenue and now to
charge users interest on it.
Holt hasn’t actually said that post-
office patrons are to be charged interest
on the amount they have been over-
charged, but he has said that when Post
Office capital is determined in “precise
terms” “we hope then” to fix the annual
return upon it which “the Post Office
should reasonably be required to seek.”
The reasonable thing to do with the
£4OO-million overcharge is to write it
off and give postal users (and the
economy) the benefit of it in some dis-
inflation of grossly inflated P.M.G. costs.

Evatt, which is rather a paradox these

Turnbull spilt the beans when he said
three out of five speakers (including

their speeches. His criticism was loudly

Honeyman, Q.C. —inquiring, with a
European, a Fijian and an Indian, into
causes of unrest among workers in the
(once) Cannibal Islands —found that much
of the unrest was due to deliberate mis-
representation by some leaders of the
union and apparently too much remote-
control by the C.S.R. The union de-
manded a wage-increase of 3s. an hour,
got a range of rises from 3d. to Is. Bd.,
and retired bellowing its indignation at
the “threat” by the C.S.R. that it had
become “increasingly anxious about the
extent to which it would be justified in
devoting its resources to Fiji.”

Queensland can note down an extra-
good records chapter to the credit of
R. A. Howell, of Devon Court, in the
northern State’s Killarney. He attended
his first Brisbane Show in 1876. He
started exhibiting in 1917. He has since
won 500 show-prizes. And now, at the
Centenary Exhibition in Brisbane, R. A.
Howell, at 94 not-out, won the first
award in the judging of Devon beef-
cattle. Beat that lot and play fair!

New editor E. K. Sinclair is the first
appointment to .Melbourne “Age’s”
chair in living memory without a political
background—a reflection of such well-to-

important ; in Melbourne journalism, at
least, they have lost much prestige as
news.
The rungs in Keith Sinclair’s ladder
have included leadership in war as well as
a long training for his present post as
the “Age’s” assistant-editor by Harold
Campbell, the editor whose death
occurred last month. Keith Sinclair was
still a young reporter when he went to
London just before the war, joined A.A.P.
cable-desk there, did a stint as a corres-
pondent in France in the phony-war
period, then enlisted in the R.A.F., to
serve as a flying-instructor in Bomber
Command (in which he once escaped by

tools were a child’s tiny paintbrush and
black ink. His usual favorite weapon is
a Chinese feather-brush ; with this he
has written his najne and address on the
antennae of a butterfly, 100 words on a
grain of rice and 3000 characters on the

“INCLEMENT WRAGGE ” was the title
THE BULLETIN bestowed on Clement
Wragge under this drawing in its issue of
September 28, 1911. Wragge had achieved
fame in the 1890’s as a result of his fore-
casting of disastrous Queensland cyclones,
but also aroused resentment among people
he criticised. He pioneered the estab-
lishment of long-range weather-forecasting
at Crohamhurst (Q.); Inigo Jones was
his pupil.
“Maitri” : Robert Arthur Broinowski,
who has passed on at Sydneyside Lind-
field at 81, was a Commonwealth public
servant for upwards of 40 years, and had
been, in the Federal sphere, Usher of the
Black Rod, Clerk-Assistant and Clerk of
the Senate. Interested in all types of
literature, and of Australian in particular,
he was an editor of the old verse-monthly
“The Spinner,” and was, as well, an
expert on aboriginal lore and a really
remarkable imitator of Australian bird-
calls —indeed, if you hadn’t known he
was on the job, you’d have started look-
ing around for the kookaburra, bellbird,
whipbird, rainbird or whatever other
feathered kind “Bruno” happened to be
imitating.

John Brennan’s tribute to a great
American:
His fame as a colorful, knock-’em-down-
drag-'em-out seagoing admiral —his ships led
the first attacks on Japanese bases after the
disaster of Pearl Harbor, launched Doolittle’s
Army bombers for the famous raid on Tokyo,
and three years later virtually destroyed the
enemy's naval potential in the Battle of the
Philippines Sea—has obscured the fact that
between times "Bull” Halsey, dead last week
at age 76, had in the South Pacific an Area
Command similar to that exercised by General
MacArthur in the South-west Pacific, Admiral
Mountbatten in India-Burma, and Admiral
Nimitz in the Central Pacific.
As such, he staged the drive by U.S. Army
and Marine divisions and New Zealand’s Third
up through the island-chain of the Solomons.
As the areas converged the South Pacific
command was merged into MacArthur’s South-
west Pacific area. The change-over took place
on the eve of the first landing on Bougainville,
at Empress Augusta Bay (November 1, 1943).
Halsey’s invasion-force was, of course, already
at sea. That evening, announcing the coming
operation, and his assumption of command, to
correspondents at his faraway Brisbane head-
quarters, MacArthur concluded: “If my luck
holds, and God is with me, Halsey will land.”
The Third Marines went ashore next morning
as planned. Whether anybody’s luck had
anything to do with it, or whether the Deity
really did intervene nobody on the spot seemed
to know. They mostly attributed the success
to preliminary planning and to the quality of
ttle tr °°P s - The Marines established themselves
and Halsey went off to roam the central and
northern Pacific with his Third Fleet. He gave
t vigor, leadership and a great deal of color.
his sailor-boys and airmen will long remember
him with affection.
Herewith Wallace Archibald Meares,
of Bogabigal, Forbes (N.S.W.), farmer
and grazier and R.A.S. councillor. Top-
ping 6ft. 2in., he’ll be remembered by
many for his part in the documentary
“Australian Food Parade,” made in 1958
and shown throughout Australia and also
in Britain—it was produced by the Com-
monwealth Film Unit for the Department
FORBES—AND FILM
of Trade to promote interest overseas
in Australian beef-cattle, dairy-products,
and canned and dried fruits. In the film
Meares had the role of an English visitor
being shown these aspects of Australian
pastoral and agricultural production, as
familiar to him personally as his own
property. There’s no doubt he did a
good job, too ; in fact, anyone who saw
the film would say he’d missed his voca-
tion.
Raised on the family property and
educated at Cranbrook School, Sydney,
Meares took-over from his father after
they had moved from Brewarrina to
Forbes. At present his main line is
raising fat-lambs. In War II he was in
New Caledonia and New Guinea with
the 2/3rd Independent Company; sub-
sequently, with two others, he won a
competition organised by the Rural Bank
which gave him a trip overseas to study
things agricultural in the U.S.A., Canada
and the U.K.

Into thp Silence:
In Brisbane, at 95, Robert John Robson,
whose grandfather skippered the sloop Rebecca
(30 tons) across Bass Strait to the River Yarra,
with John Batman aboard in 1835, for the
beginning of what is now Melbourne.
At Boonah Hospital (Q.), Miss Una Bell,
hostess at her century-old homestead, Coochin
Coochin, to a succession of Royal visitors from
the Prince of Wales in 1920 to Princess Alice
in 1959.
In Sydney, at 93, George Lindsay Archer,
of Lindfield. He belonged to the Central
Queensland pioneering family whose members
discovered the Fitzroy River and were the first
to ship wool from the place where Rockhamp-
ton now stands. For many years he was
pastoral inspector for the Commercial Banking
Co. of Sydney.
In Perth, Mrs. Alice Plant, believed to have
been the oldest woman in Westralia. Born
in London in 1854, she came here about 90
years ago, living the greater part of her life
in the Westralian timber-milling country around
what is now called Mt. Helena. Descendants
tally more than her own 104 years.
In Ballarat, at 88, David Clarke, Victoria’s
leading authority on mining-law, as well as
being a noted horticulturist and station-owner,
and in his day a topnotch footballer, goiter
and rower.

ABONGINALITIESS
UP QUEENSLAND WAY
Up Queensland way with cattle
He’s travelled regions vast,
And many months have vanished
Since home-folks saw him last.

an’ we don’t know where he are.”

Some “Aboriginalities” verses and selected paragraphs of the past and
present with the warm flavor of the Northern State and parts Northern . . .
An epic tale of horsemanship equalling
that of the “Man From Snowy
River” is kept green in the annals
of Warwick (Q.). The Gammie brothers,
owners of North Talgai station, imported
in 1854 the thoroughbred stallion Con-
servative. Wicked and spirited, he
managed to escape to the ranges, pene-
trated into the deep valley of Thane’s
Creek, where he quickly attracted a
mob of wild horses, former escapees,
and defied all attempts at recapture. He
was at that time the most expensive
horse imported into Australia, and a
big reward was offered to get him. After
a crack rider, a Mexican working for
squatter and breeder R. C. Haley, had
failed, a young Queenslander, Rory
McLeod, set out on a horse given him
by George Leslie, of Canning Downs,
and after daring riding and a good deal
of cajolery he got a halter on the run-
away and brought him home through
country as rough and dangerous as that
traversed by the storied rider. —“Chloe.”

“Dungeness”: Binghi has his Cowes
yachting-meets, but his racing-rules
would have made Sopwith or Lipton
keel-over at the wheel. The leading
affairs of the season used to be held
at Murray Island, in Thursday Island-
built dinghies, owners in command. A
turning-mark having been selected —
maybe a floating coconut or a jumping
fish —a gun was fired, and the com-
petitors went their hardest, while friends
and backers raced around the beach
howling encouragement. First round the
“But isn't it cheating to shake the
machine ?”
mark turned, but so did all the rest, con-
tinuing on the return course until some
sportsman went-about in the lead.
Finally a milling mass of boats collected
off the starting-point and another gun
was fired. Competitors got ashore, and,
joined by their supporters, made for the
judge. He awarded the prize to the one
who could yell loudest and jump highest
when advancing his claims. Decisions
were never questioned —everyone was
getting ready for the next event.

“Gryllus”: When the cooee-bird and
his handsome lady can be heard in their
distressed-motorist duet, one can be sure
that spring has really come to south
Queensland. It sounds exactly like - some-
one cooee-ing at intervals and grinding
a self-starter in between. So much so
that city visitors have been known to
set-out on rescue-expeditions, returning
later with caustic remarks about bush
practical-jokers. He, a stalwart blue-
black, red-eyed, long-tailed chap, as big
as a currawong, does the cooee-ing. She,
garbed in striped-brown-and-greenish-
white, with a handsome barred front to
her costume and a black toque, operates
the self-starter' They are great travellers,
with a range from Timor and New
Guinea to south Victoria, though their
annual trip rarely takes them beyond
the N.S.W. central coast. I admit their
awful voices, but please don’t be irri-
tated into shooting them.
“McNorth”: Like some of her
sisters with pale skins, Mary
Binghi of far-north Queensland
rarely squats for a spell or a gossip
without producing some work to
keep her fingers busy. In the camps
around Cape York partly-finished
dilly-bags, pliable baskets and
stocks of material are always in
evidence whenever gins forgather.
The material is generally broad-
leaved la-lang grass, split fine and
bleached. Brown strands for the
working-in of patterns are obtained
by soaking the grass in water in
which iron has been rusted. Some
of the designs evidence taste, and
all are carried through with an
artistic completeness. Mr. and Mrs.
Binghi are expert weavers, with
fingers that work almost auto-
matically, and the only pause is
when the inevitable cigarette of
trade-tobacco rolled in newspaper
or tea-tree bark comes round, or
when work is dropped to hear an
extra-spicy bit of gossip.
THE OPAL MINER
[At Stoney Creek opal-mine, 110 miles
w.-n.-w. of Quilpie, Queensland, I found a
lonely grave in the actual workings. A metal
tag was wired to a sapling, now rotted away,
with these words: “Peter Boylan, 69 yrs., died
1906; erected by his brother Lawrence. R.I.P.J
Oh, Peter Boylan, 69,
I’m looking at your opal-mine;
No doubt your brother Lawrence, too,
Stood here thinking as I do!
T’was in your blood the same as mine
To wander o’er these hills of time,
Seeking for the treasured Gem
And finding such a few of them !
I traced your steps, your camping-ground,
The very place you slept, I found
Your camel-pads led me this way,
Only just the other day —
Now fifty years and more have passed
Since you lay down, and slept your last.
You sunk your shaft through sandstone
rock,
And sometimes worked around the
clock —
No man can stop when gemstones gleam,
Out from a fiery sandstone seam ! —
And underneath the gypsum line
The paydirt-boulder you would find.
You’ve sat upon this rock to rest,
A nd figured how to work it best:
You’d switch a little bit around,
And send your mate down underground,
Never can a braceman find
An idle moment on a mine !
Soon as you felt it good to stop
You’d hear a voice call out, “On top !”
The windlass creaks, she comes up slow.
You’d sing out “Coming down, below.”
The dirt you’d shovel all away,
The same as I have done today;
You’d drink the water from the bag,
Wipe off the sweat with that old rag —•
You’ve specked around with eyes as keen
As my old eyes have ever been ;
You’d pick-up colors here and there,
Spit off the dust to lay them bare ...
Peter, l can see you still
Prospecting there upon this hill!
QUEENSLAND.

TN a North Queensland ghost-town
I rejected on sight the first
of the hotels I came to. I was rejected
at the second by the landlord: “Sorry,
mate, I can’t put you up tonight. Fact
is, the chef’s shot through on me, the
plumbing’s gone crook, and I’m having
a bit of a blue with me missus.” Later
that night, as I lay in my bed at hotel
number-three, I realised that “ghost-
town” was not such a bad description,
as the ghosts, still wearing their mining-
boots, held a corroboree in the ceiling
over my head —or was it just rats or
possums ?—“Buffo.”

“Norque”: Saw one of those old 400-
gallon ship’s tanks bent to the service
of modern mechanics. In a bough-shed
at the end-of-the-line station served by
“The Cowlander” —the non-air-condi-
tioned weekly train from Cloncurry—l
found a stout-hearted chap cold-
chiselling pieces from an antique speci-
men to fashion temporary clutch-plates
for his grounded three-ton truck ; he
had contracted to cart timber down
Boulia way for a new homestead, and
time was of the essence. After two days’
striving “by guess and by eye” the plates
took shape and looked like small buzz-
saws. Finger-holes were made with a
drill borrowed from a blacksmith.
Linings were transferred from discarded
plates. Contrary to all the gloomy fore- •
bodings of the local Jonahs come to
watch the anticipated smash, the truck,
with two tons of timber up, jumped
about 6ft. in the right direction and
continued on its way, noisily and roughly,
for the outward trip, and return-empty
stage—2oo miles in all—until close to
journey’s end, when the gadget cut-out,
though the driver was able to coast the
last 200yds. on a welcome down-grade
to the goods-shed, where an orthodox
replacement-clutch was waiting.

“Ewa”: Lobbed at a selector’s humpy
near Proserpine (Q.) at night and had
to turn-in with twin nine-year-old boys
because of the scarcity of beds. I was
in the middle. Something stirring under
my back caused the boys to chuckle,
so I thought it was merely a game of
theirs. I must have dozed-off, for the
next thing I knew was that both kids
were sitting up in bed, whistling. As
soon as they saw I was awake they
ducked under the blankets and laughed.
I was cogitating whether to give them
a cuff when I saw a pair of eyes making
along the rafters towards the bed. A
dig in the ribs produced the information
that “That’s Jenny, she sleeps on the
foot of the bed—Jimmy dosses in the
mattress.” I slept in the bush for the
rest of the night. Cocky told me next
day that the snakes had been in the
house ever since the twins were born.
Y’ can’t beat ’em for keeping-down the
rats an’ mice,” he assured me.

t{ 8011-ant Bill”: Old Joe’s request for
a few o’ those Brisbane papers to make
a drop o’ paper-oil for me sore tooth”
took me back to boyhood, and I asked
him to show me how the real dinkum
stuff was manufactured. He rolled several
thicknesses into a cylinder, damped it
slightly in places, cut a V-notch in one
end to take an old spoon, supported it
on the billy-hook, and touched it off
at the top. When it had smouldered
down to a few inches he withdrew the
spoon, a quarter-full of yellow oily
liquid, dipped a piece of cottonwool
and pushed it into the offending grinder.
“She’s dinkum, Bill,” he announced after
a few minutes. “Nothing like paper-oil
for toothache. Better’n tobacco or pipe-
juice, though pipe-juice is the stuff if
you bit be a snake. Rub it well in,
an y don t need no doctor. And,
reckerlect, if the kids get earache, just
blow few puffs of y’re pipe inta the
ear ole. ’ After all, Joe’s paper-oil is
“ That's contraband!"
just creosote, when you come to think,
and creosote is an old bush-cure for
toothache.

“Rox”: ’Way back in the one-pub
town of Bungaroo in Western Queens-
land, where the horses have hollow
backs from passing under the sun, the
local ped., O’Kelly, was a man of many
parts. Besides running the local school,
he was ambulance, Progress Association,
race-club, police-court, and many other
things. He loved to display his eloquence
at progress-meetings, and was “our
special correspondent” of the next town’s
“Sunset Sentinel.” In his spare moments
he pulled beer at McGrew’s pub. Apart
from O’Kelly, the annual races, held
about three times a year, were the only
other cause of commotion in the town-
ship. So when, on the second annual
meeting that year, the association’s own
horse won the Claypan Stakes, O'Kelly,
as the association, duly celebrated. Next
morning a gloomy and bedraggled ped.
cast-up at the school. The police-court,
ambulance, etc., slumped into a chair
and wearily directed the class to draw
a map of Queensland. While the scholars
toiled, O’Kelly slept fitfully. Coming-to,
he demanded to know if his orders had
been carried out, and, on being assured
in unison that they had, he ordered that
one example be brought to him. As his
gaze fell on it he shuddered, muttered
something about his not being surprised
if he did look like that, then shouted to
the class: “Now draw a map of Hell,
an’ make Bungaroo the capital of it!”

“W.P.T.”: One source of income
available to me when I was a lad, but
denied the lads of today, was the
collecting and selling of wax-match boxes.
Golfers paid 3d. a dozen; they used
them as tees. Prospectors kept small
nuggets in their matchboxes, and a swag-
man I knew up in western Queensland
kept a couple of cattle-ticks in one.
If denied a handout at a home-
stead, he would open the matchbox
and show the ticks to the squatter: “Well,
I’ll just have to let my pet ticks go and
fend for themselves if I can’t get a bit
of meat for them.” He was always given
a handout and a warning to take his
ticks off the place without delay.

“Flight” : No camp or settlement in
W.Q. is more than a few hours old when
the kite-hawks discover it, swing over it
endlessly, on the alert for scraps. Station-
homesteads and boundary-rider’s camps
have a constant cloud of them spiralling
above. On the wholly false premise that
he is hot stuff on grasshoppers, the kite is
a protected bird ; but the only ’hoppers
he ever gets are odd ones on the wing
which have been disturbed by a horse-
man or a mob of stock. His stumps of
legs don’t allow him to chase them on the
ground ; and his broad and hooked beak
won’t probe for sacs of eggs in the
earth, in the manner of an ibis and
other real destroyers of ’hoppers.


RACHEL HENNING writes from Exmoor
waiMJM ommsms Jpsmmm —1863
Exmoor,
Begun December 20, 1863.
My Dearest Etta,
When I last wrote we had
begun shearing, but were
sorely hindered by the wet;
that all passed off in a week,
though, and since we have had
it tremendously hot, real
tropical summer weather. The
thermometer stood at one
hundred yesterday in the shady
veranda, and for days it has
been ninety-five of an after-
noon in the parlor.
The wonderful thing is that
people go on with their work
just as usual. The shearers
shear, and Biddulph and Mr.
Julian roll-up and tie their
fleeces, and Mr. Taylor and his
gang (about eight men) stand
in the river and scrub the sheep
all day. I think they have
rather the best of it.
Shearing must be awful work
stooping over the sheep the
whole of these burning days,
and yet several of our shearers
shear one hundred sheep a day,
an d one man who is a cracker
shearer can shear a hundred
and fifty, working long hours,
They get well paid, 4s. 9d. a
score of sheep, but it is very
hard work. Biddulph says he
tried it when he was at Gin-
Gin learning sheep-farming,
and lumbago was nothing to
th e backache it gave him.
Everybody will be glad when
the shearing is over. It is one
perpetual drive of work, shep-
herds coming and going, flocks
“camped” about in every direc-
tion (for they have not yards
enough for half of them), and
then they have to wait till all
the sheep lie down, light several
fires round'the flocks and then
camp by the fires to look after
the sheep, and drive them in,
if they begin to go away to
feed in the night.
Biddulph and Mr. Taylor
are generally camped out some-
where, for the shepherds are
not to be trusted at night, and
Mr. Hedgeland often goes out
also. Mr. Hedgeland came
back on the 13th, having been
away two months. I do not
know how long he will stay,
but I suppose till we go to
Sydney. We expect to leave
Exmoor about the . end of
January, and have already
packed up and sent away some
boxes to Sydney, as they had
to go with the wool-drays. I
cannot say there was a great
deal in them, as we have not
much clothes to spare just at
present. It is coming back that
they will be full.
What we shall want for the
voyage down, and for our stay
in Port Denison, we shall have
to take with us on pack-horses.
Biddulph will want a change
after all the bother and hard
work of shearing, and Annie
wants to go down, but for my
own sake I think it is going
through a great deal of
trouble to arrive at very little.
As the boy said when he had
learned the alphabet.
Except Amy, there is nobody
I care to see in N. S. Wales,
and this easy out-of-door life
with the shady house and
veranda in the heat of the day
and the beautiful evenings to
walk in is far pleasanter than
the dull streets of Sydney,
dusty or muddy, as the case
may be ; besides, I feel morally
convinced that some misfor-
tune will befall my pet lambs
while I am away, or they will
be neglected. However, it is no
use to grumble, and we hope
to be back here again in three
months, when the hot weather
is over, and the beautiful winter
has begun.
Sometimes I think perhaps
we shall never come back to
remain. Biddulph may at last
find him a wife in Sydney;
for his own sake I should be
very glad, for I think he would
be happier, and he is quite
old enough to know his own
mind, and well off enough to
marry. Well, if he does there
is a pleasant side to it even as
far as I am concerned, for
though I should be sorry to
leave Exmoor I should see
England again, and you and
the children! Annie would
mind more, but I suppose she
would stay with Amy till
married herself.
I do not know what tempted
me to give you this dose of
speculation on-possibilities, but,
of course, one often thinks of
the changes and chances that
may come, and Annie and I
sometimes talk of them.
Since I last wrote the drays
have come in again and started
once more with their second
load of wool. Biddulph has
nearly always two drays on the
road going down with wool or
bringing up supplies. The
bullock-drivers are almost the
best-paid men on the place.
They get 40s. a week, as much
a year as some clerks and
curates have to live on at
home. It requires a great deal
of skill and practice, though,
to make twelve or fourteen
bullocks all pull together.
Biddulph had two very good


drivers in his employ, but one
of them died on the last trip
up very suddenly. His dray
had capsized in a creek, and,
as a storm was threatening
which would have spoilt all the
cargo, he and the other driver
and some men who were
travelling up the road with
them worked very hard at re-
loading it. It was a very hot
day, and Miller, who was a
very excitable man, overexerted
himself, they supposed.
Whether it was that or a sun-
stroke or heart complaint no-
body seems to know, but he
sat down to drink some water
and died in a few minutes.
Gordon, a gentleman
who was passing and who
told us about it, tried to bleed
him, but it was no use. They
dug a grave on the bank of the
creek. Lowe, the other driver,
said he should like “a prayer
read over him,” and Mr.
Gordon got out a church ser-
vice and read the English ser-
vice, then they fenced-in the
grave and left him.
Everybody here was very
sorry when the news came,
for poor Miller was much
liked on the station. He was
a German by birth, and
Biddulph is trying to get more
information about his family
and relations, if he had any.
I told you of the old shep-
herd Scotty’s death. Biddulph
could never hear of or trace
any relations of his, and his
wages, something between £3O
and £4O, remain in Biddulph’s
hands. He is keeping the
money towards a church at
Port Denison, which has long
been talked of, but they do not
seem able to get funds to begin
it. I suppose they will as the
place increases. Meanwhile
the police-magistrate as the
chief Government official there
reads the service on a Sunday
in the courthouse.
There is no clergyman, and
no funds to support one at
present. People are married at
the registry-office, baptised not
at all and buried by anyone
who is kind enough to “read
a prayer,” as the poor bullock-
driver said. The English advo-
cates of the voluntary system
should come to Port Denison
to test its efficacy!
We are looking forward to
Christmas now, though the
shearing will not be over ; how-
ever, they will make a holiday
Friday and Saturday, of course.
How different from your
Christmas weather! I dare say
you have snow on the ground
and hard frost perhaps. How
well I remember the last
Christmas I was at home! This
morning was cloudy, and we
were all saying how nice and
cool it was, though the thermo-
meter over our heads was
standing at eighty-five, which
we should call very hot in
England. We begin to shiver
when it is seventy only.
Annie has been concocting
mince-meat. She and Mr.
Hedgeland held a great chop-
ping in the veranda yesterday
while I was settling the week’s
accounts inside, and when I
went out I beheld a black-
looking mass like a huge dirt-
pie. It was made of dried
apples and currants, raisins,
spice, brandy, etc., and I dare
say will prove very nice, though
it looks queer. Of course it
would be bad in a day if you
put meat or suet with it.
We have doubts about the
plum-pudding, as we have no
eggs at present, and the fowls
refuse to lay. Mr. Taylor
wrote to Mr. Woodward, whom
Biddulph invited to come here
for Christmas, and requested
him to bring a few eggs with
him, as he keeps fowls, but if
he comes he will have a thirty-
mile ride on horseback, and it
is very doubtful in what case
the eggs will arrive.
We have actually had
another lady visitor since I
wrote last. Gentlemen visitors
are nothing, they come so often.
There are three reading now in
the room where I am writing,
and as I have to talk to them
now and then you must excuse
any mistakes I make, but
our last week’s visitor was
old Mrs. Lack, rather a
pleasant, quiet old lady who
wore a large sun-bonnet and
made her own gowns.
Mr. Lack bought a run
[now called Tiverton] off
Biddulph, about fifteen miles
from here, and his father and
mother and several brothers are
living there with him. We
always intended to call on the
old lady. Mr. Lack used to
say he thought she would
rather wait till they were more
settled. However, last week
he brought her over to see us
and she stayed three days. We
rather liked her, but it is
rather troublesome to entertain
a lady. They cannot go up
to the woolshed or betake
themselves to the store as
gentlemen do. I took her out
walking with me in the even-
ings, and she greatly admired
the “black lamb”—in fact the
whole posse of pets that
followed us, even dogs and
lambs. Then she meandered
in and out of the veranda and
worked a little and read a little
and so got through the day.
From THE BULLETIN Black-and-white Gallery —
George Lambert—1901
She talked a great deal about
her family, as old ladies like
to do, gave us the histories of
her six sons and two daughters,
both of whom are married in
the colony, and finally departed,
taking with her some beef and
two live fowls wherewith to
commence a poultry-yard.
They have no cattle on their
run as we have, so they live
entirely on mutton. They are
going to send over here for
some beef and suet the day
before Christmas Day.
Our gardening is nearly at
an end for this year ■ — this
summer, I mean —the sun has
burnt up everything. You
should see how the pumpkins
and cucumbers and water-
melons droop in the heat
of the day, and though
they revive in the evening they
do not grow. We can get
flowers and vegetables for
three-fourths of the year, but
in the three summer months,
flowers none, and of vegetables
okra seems to be the only one
likely to do, that being a West
Indian production, rather
prefers to be scorched. When
we come back from Sydney I

OUR BUDGET AND U.K. INVESTORS
An inflow of overseas funds
to Australia for portfolio
investment has been a con-
siderably publicised feature of
the booming sharemarkets in
the Commonwealth over the
past year.
For 1958-59 the net inflow
of capital into Australia on
private account was £ll2
million, compared with £B7
million in the preceding year.
This net capital-inflow, which
covers some balancing and un-
accounted-for items, includes
direct investment in new or
established industries set-up by
overseas corporations in Aus-
tralia, but the big increase in
the past year appears to be
largely the result of overseas
investors, and particularly
United Kingdom investors,
entering into the purchase of
shares already listed on Aus-
tralian Stock Exchanges.
London stockbrokers and
financial publicists have been
issuing pamphlets or articles on
the Australian sharemarket for
some time, and London finan-
cial newspapers and “The
Times” have kept fairly close
tab on recent Australian eco-
nomic developments a great
change from a few years ago.
As an instance of the keen
watch being kept in London
on the Australian sharemarket
and financial developments in
London, some comments by
“The Times” are here repub-
lished. They appeared in “The
Times” of August 17 —only six
days after Mr. Holt presented
his Budget in Canberra:
The Australian Budget proposal
to introduce an optional with-
holding-tax on dividends seems
likely to have distinct advantages
for United Kingdom investors.
Large institutional investors who
place part of their portfolios in
Australia in pursuance of geographi-
cal diversification policies should
find it especially helpful. Provided
the necessary legislation is passed,
British investors will have alter-
native methods of meeting their
liabilities for Australian tax on
dividends; they may choose either
to accept a 15 per cent, with-
holding-tax or to continue to be
taxed on the present basis.
Investors drawing only a small
dividend-income from Australia
will not be greatly affected. But
the large investor in Australian
ordinary shares will benefit sub-
stantially by opting for the with-
holding-tax. His high rate of
United Kingdom tax enables him
to offset substantial tax-payments
in Australia against U.K. tax-
liability. For him, there is a
double benefit. First he is saved
the inconvenience and cost of an
Australian income-tax return, while
reclaiming Australian tax-payments
under double-tax relief is simpli-
fied and expedited. Secondly, in
so far as the withholding-tax is
at a lower rate than his present
levels of direct income-tax on Aus-
tralian income, he will pay less
Australian tax. Many U.K.
investors in Australia can now
gain credit for all Australian tax
against U.K. tax, but the changes
extend this privilege to investors
on lower ranges of U.K. tax.
Some Examples
Some examples illustrate these
developments. However much the
U.K. investor draws in ordinary
Australian dividends in any year,
direct Australian income-tax need
not exceed 15 per cent, if the with-
holding-tax is employed, and will
not call for any tax-return to the
authorities. As most Australian
companies pay company income-tax
at about 7s. 6d. in the £, the
ordinary shareholder in the U.K.
is credited with having paid that
tax as well as the 15 per cent.
For every £ASOOO of Australian
ordinary dividends he will pay
£A7SO withholding-tax and receive
credit against U.K. tax of £A7SO,
plus £A3OOO company-tax paid.
Thus, his yield on Australian shares
is raised by £A3OOO in effect, pro-
vided his U.K. tax on the £ABOOO
gross income amounts to at least
£A3750 —i.e., his average rate is
at least 9s. 6d. in the £. Even
if his U.K. rate is only 7s. 9d. he
will receive credit for most of this
extra £A3OOO.
Published market yields are based
on the £ASOOO dividend declared
in Australia. If this is shown
at 5 per cent., the large U.K.
investor, enjoying credit for all the
Australian company-tax of £A3OOO,
receives in effect an 8 per cent,
yield: this represents the yield
on the same basis as published
English security yields: that is,
subject to U.K. income-tax.
The following table shows the
yields in Australia for some of
the largest companies early this
month. These companies have paid
company income-tax at slightly
different rates in respect of latest
dividends, but all near the 7s. 6d.
level. If a U.K. investor suffered
deduction of withholding-tax from
ordinary dividends of these com-
panies, he would enjoy the true
yields shown in the table if his
U.K. tax-rate was 9s. 4d. in the
£ or more:

yield. resident.

In view of complaints that U.K.
investors have made about Aus-
tralia’s requirement for income-tax
returns and the preference they
have expressed for a withholding-
tax, the Budget proposals should
“Come out , Butch — We know you're here!"
encourage more United Kingdom
investment in Australia.
Apart from their interest to
London portfolio investors,
these comments show the Aus-
tralian personal investor what
he is up against when he comes
to bid against the London
buyer, and what prospective in-
fluence on Australian share
prices resides in the introduc-
tion of the withholding-tax.
Institutional investors in
Australia also have an advan-
tage over the private investor
in so far as they do not pay tax
on dividends received, although
their shareholders pay tax on
any dividends received from
institutional investments.
Heavy Demand for Mt. Isa
A fter some heavy selling at
the 505.-mark, American
and London investors have
come into our market on a
buying-spree for the ss. stock
units of Mt. Isa Mines, Ltd.
Overseas investors are no doubt
looking at the long-term pros-
pect. Finance for improve-
ments to the Mt. Isa-Towns-
ville railway seems certain,
either through overseas borrow-
ing or through a State or
Commonwealth loan.
On the production side, the
present schedule is aimed to
lift output to double last year’s
figure. A further shaft is to be
sunk, and the resultant lift in
production is expected to be a
further 50 per cent.
The short-term outlook con-
tinues to be bright. The
planned reduction in silver-
lead and zinc production is
being offset by the increased
copper output. With copper
prices for the year just ended
well above the previous year’s
depressed level, profits for last
year should be above the pre-
ceding year’s £1,424,129.
A greater degree of liquidity
at balance-date could result in
the 25 p.c. dividend being paid
in cash instead of the usual
bonus-scrip issue.

Adelaide Steam
Pllowing a second offer
from H. C. Sleigh, Ltd.,
for a takeover of its shares or
an integration of interests,
Adelaide Steamship Co., Ltd.,
without disclosing terms of
either offer, last Thursday
asked that dealings in its shares
be suspended from Stock Ex-
change quotation.
Sydney and Adelaide com-
plied ; Melbourne had already
acted on its own initiative and
suspended dealing in the shares.
On Wednesday of last week
Adelaide Steam shares closed
at 60s. 6d. in Adelaide and
585., buyer, in Sydney. The
shares sold at 255. earlier this
year.
Adelaide Steam has promised
to consider H. C. Sleigh’s offer
and to report to shareholders.
Unofficial reports say the offer
is four H. C. Sleigh ss. shares
(now at 20s. 6d.) for each
Adelaide £1 share.
Sydney Real-estate Battle
An unnamed takeover-bidder
offering 955. (cash) per 15s.
share in Richardson and
Wrench (Sydney estate-agency
co.) remained unnamed at the
weekend, still acting anony-
mously through a firm of
sharebrokers (Roland Walton
and Co.). But a higher offer
has been put in by L. J.
Hooker Investment Corpora-
tion —alternatively £5 ss. cash
or six f.-p. ss. shares in L.J.H.,
which would have a total
current market-value of £5 15s.
The L.J.H. offer was left
with Richardson and Wrench
on August 12, and when it had
not been publicly mentioned by
R. and W. by August 20,
Hooker’s themselves published
terms of the offer.
There has been a massing of
competitive resources between
Hooker’s and Dusseldorp’s
Civil and Civic Contractors;
and Hooker’s are no doubt con-
cerned about the chances of
R. and W. being taken into
the other camp. Mr. Dussel-
dorp has denied any such
intention.
Since the heavy public re-
sponse to the Hooker-spon-
sored Land-trust promotion
has become clear (the first
trust, offering 4,000,000 ss.
units, has been fully sub-
scribed), other real - estate
people have been preparing to
come into this field, and one
suggesting an immediate in-
come-return of 7 p.c., against
the Hooker promotion’s fore-
cast 8 p.c., has already been
putting-out preliminary pub-
licity.
In all this activity the Aus-
tralian Fixed Trusts people
can hardly remain uncon-
cerned ; and of some signifi-
cance also may have been the
resignation of L. J. Hooker
from the board of Realty
Development Corporation, an
offshoot of the Development
Finance Corporation (tied-in
with Australian Fixed Trusts),
with which the stockbroking
firm of Patrick and Co. have
connections, and with which,
also, big overseas interests,
including the Rothschilds and
“Pearl and the Pru.” have
shareholdings.
Richardson and Wrench has
been a conservatively con-
ducted business for just on a
century (it was established in
1860 by the two partners—a
Scotsman and an Englishman
—whose names form the title),
and it gained its greatest im-
petus with the introduction in
1872 of Alexander Walter
Scott Gregg, who was born on
the site of the present Bryant
House, in Pitt Street (a few
doors down from R. and W.’s
own building), and who, though
he had a scanty schooling, was
something of a genius with
figures and values.
Flotation into a public co.
came in 1889, at the height of
the land-boom. It was a novel
float, the outcome of a chance
remark in the lounge-room of
the Union Club, of which
Wrench was a member. E. P.
Simpson, of the legal firm of
Want, Johnson and Co., who
was also a member, jokingly
asked Wrench what price he
placed on his business. “Sixty-
thousand pounds,” was the
prompt reply. “Very well,”
said Simpson, “we will float
a company for you.” The
whole of the capital was put-up
by members of the Union Club
within a few hours.
The new co. paid modest
divs. right through the depres-
sion of the ’nineties, rising to
juicy figures after World
War I.
In 1917, in order to finance
the purchase of C. H. Cram-
mond and Co., an additional
£9350 of capital was got in,
but six years later ss. a share
was returned to shareholders,
reducing capital tO 1 £52,500.
Capital has remained static
at that figure ever since, and
thereby appears to hang a tale
concerning the present take-
over offer. Hooker’s have come
along during the past quarter-
of-a-century and have out-
stripped R. and W. for leader-
ship in the N.S.W. real-estate
business, and have not hesi-
tated to ask shareholders or
the public to put-up additional
funds necessary to finance their
expansion. They have gone
also into the hotel business, and
diversification has become part
of their planning.
Apparently sensing the im-
minence of a takeover offer,
Richardson and Wrench an-
nounced a bonus-issue of one-
for-two on August 3. But the
company has now been caught-
up in the whirlpool of the high-
pressure takeover game, and it
remains to be seen whether the
board will acquiesce to one

Oil Prospects in Queensland
[From L. Owenl
/Queensland was the first
State in the Common-
wealth to strike a measurable
flow of petroleum and “wet”
gas. Although this occurred at
the turn of the century, near
Roma, and in spite of the fact
that drilling has been active
in the area over much of the
last 50 years, the effort has not
been rewarded by even
approximately commercial
results.
From time to time in these
pages the tale of the search
for oil in Queensland has been
recorded in considerable detail,
and it need not, therefore, be
repeated. It will be obvious,
however, to the knowledgeable
reader that the search has been
conducted, in the past, by com-
panies possessing—with a few
notable exceptions—neither the
necessary technical know-how
nor geologists with the essential
oilfield experience.
Today the position has
changed considerably as many
powerful oil groups—mostly of
U.S. origin have taken-up
permits to prospect for oil
under the following names:
Australian-American Oil Co.,
Delhi-Australian Petroleum, Ltd.,
Gene Goff Pty., Ltd., Humber-
Barrietr Reef Oils Pty., Ltd., Lucky
Strike Drilling Co., Oklahoma-
Australian Oil Co., Plymouth Oil
Co., Santiago Petroleum Co.,
Trans-Pacific Corporation.
A thorough examination of
Queensland’s oil prospects may
thus be expected shortly ; it is,
in fact, already commenced.
However, a word of caution
is called for from the geological
point of view.
Study of the record of the
groups represented in the list
of companies given above will
reveal that most of them have
earned success in areas in
which the geological history
has been comparatively normal
and in which,, therefore, the
classical methods of explora-
tion have, in general, worked
out satisfactorily.
In contrast, the Australian
mainland has been subjected
to a series of geological
events which has resulted in
very specialised geological con-
ditions. Employment of the
classical methods of oil-search
has thus invariably ended in
failure, in spite of an expendi-
ture of at least million in
Queensland alone.
The most important of these
geological conditions is the
sustained depositional break
which continued—with minor
local exceptions—from Per-
mian to Jurassic times and was
further complicated by con-
siderable tectonic activities.
The combined effect has been
to divorce, almost completely,
pre-Triassic from post-Triassic
structures.
In addition, the oil so far
encountered—either in traces
or in measurable quantities
possesses all the characteristics
of long-distance migrated
petroleum, and the available
evidence goes to show that all
of it is of pre-Triassic origin ;
some of it is of Cambrian age.
New methods, therefore,
must be adopted and adapted
to oil-exploitation in Queens-
land. The most important
factors to be determined are
(a) the paths which the migrat-
ing petroleum has followed, and
( b ) the nature and extent of the
pre-Triassic structures capable
of acting as oil reservoirs.
It is extremely unlikely that
post-Triassic structures will
provide clues of value. Prac-
tically all the oil which reached
the surface during Triassic
times was dissipated and the
chances of striking worth-while
residues from “fossil” seeps
(c/. Rough Range, W.A.) are
negligible.
The Last Vic. Goldmines
A/Torning Star, at Woods
Point, Victoria, will close
when the remaining ore-reserves
are mined, and the company’s
assets will be sold. The mine
paid more than £400,000 in
dividends, and was one of the
last three goldmines to operate
in Victoria. The remaining

Sandy’s Selection
vmmm —1903
By "STEELE RUDD"
The Parkers were friends
of Sandy’s and Kate’s,
and lived in town, where
they were mostly out of
work. Sometimes Sandy sent
them a bag of potatoes ; and
once Parker sent Sandy a case
of fruit, which the railway
people enjoyed.
Jimmy Parker came to
Sandy’s to spend a holiday.
Jimmy was about 14, and had
never been to the bush. He
had often longed to see it,
though; and to become
acquainted with cattle and
kangaroos was his ambition.
Sandy met him at the railway
and took him to the selection
in the dray. Jimmy was de-
lighted to see so much country,
and all the way along nursed
a small rifle he brought with
him.
“How ’re y’ on kang’roos?”
Sandy asked, eyeing the wea-
pon. Jimmy said he didn’t
know. “Never had a shot at
any.”
Sandy told him there were
thousands round his place, and
boasted of the size and ferocity
of them. Jimmy drew deep
breaths, and his eyes rolled
excitedly.
“How do you manage,” he
asked, “when an old man
tackles you?”
“Them’s one of th’ things
y’ ’ve got t’ look out f’r,”
Sandy answered lightly, giving
the old mare the double of
the reins, hard, on the rump
and making her go a lot
slower. “The las’ time one
tackled me,” he went on, “I
just took ’im be th’ throat
with me left hand till I got out
me knife ; then I stuck it inter
’im an’ ripped ’im right up t’
th’ bloomin’ mouth an’ let a
heap o’ green grass outer ’im.”
Jimmy shuddered, and sud-
denly discovered he had left
his pocket-knife at home.
“Well, while y’re up ’ere,”
Sandy said advisedly, “you had
better borrow mine whenever
y’ go out.”
Silence for about a mile.
Going down the Gap, near
Talty s, a great noise suddenly
broke out. There was wild
commotion in the gully.
“Hello!” Sandy said, stop-
ping the dray ; “they’re after
somethin’.” And he stared
about. “There it comes!” he
cried; “look out! . . . Get
y’r rifle.”
A tired, miserable marsupial
floundered towards them pur-
sued by three of the Talty girls
and an old blind dog.
“Sool ’im, sool ’im! ” the
girls were shouting, and the
blind dog sooled in modera-
tion.
Sandy jumped off the dray
and heaved a waddy vainly at
the passing ’roo, then joined in
the chase. But Jimmy sat still
and grinned and wondered. A
’roo hunt was new to Jimmy.
When the dray arrived at
the selection Kate met it at
the rails and nearly shook
Jimmy’s hand off. Kate always
got excited when visitors came.
She commented on his altered
appearance, asked him how
his mother was and how his
father was keeping, and if the
baby was walking yet, and
why Julia, his sister, didn’t
come, and finished by inquir-
ing how he liked Sleepy Creek,
Then she foraged in the dray
for things Sandy had brought
f rom the store,
“What about tea? Didn’t
y’ bring tea ?” she cried,
Sandy threw down a new
rake he had purchased and
stared sheepishly,
“Clean f’got it!” he gasped,
« w « v » thine" Kate

s " ap Why it was what we
f ? te f 1 tolc ! y

Aln?t y’ B ot none at a 1 1?”
Sandy murmured.
Jimmy f f was ‘ n
Way ’ and Strolled oVer t 0 the
ga f ir^ n i 0 „ „ . A
Got none? Kate snorted.
“Of course I ain’t.”
Sandy looked very dejected.
“ Y ’ didn’t f’get y’r old
rotten t’bacca, I know!”
Sandy made no remark.
“Oh, yer mighter thought of
it! ”—reproachfully. Then she
went inside and slipped out
the other door, and went off
to Mrs. Hogan’s as fast as she
could run. Kate was a great
one for tea.
Jimmy removed his hat at
the door and smoothed his hair
with his hand. Sandy kept his
on.
“Y’ know me Uncle?” Sandy
said, introducing Jimmy.
Uncle grinned and leaned
round to shake hands without
getting up, and the pumpkin
he was sitting on at the fire
rolled, and he slipped off.
Sandy laughed. Uncle re-
covered himself and sat staring
into Jimmy’s face as if he was
a kangaroo, and made him
uneasy.
“Pull y’r boxes up,” Sandy
said when tea was ready, and
dumped his own down at the
head of the table.
They all sat round. Sandy
piled enough corned-beef and
potatoes and pumpkin on
Jimmy’s plate to last him a
week, and worried him all
through the meal to take more.
And when he refused a third
cup of tea Kate became
alarmed about his health. She
was sure he was ill, and sug-
gested he take a dose of oil
or something and go to bed
early. But Jimmy shook his
head and smiled. After tea
Sandy proposed a “bit o’
possum shootin’,” and he and
Jimmy got ready and went out.
They mooned about, falling
over logs and fouling brambles
and limbs that nearly poked
their eyes out, until the moon
went down, but didn’t see a
solitary possum—saw nothing
to blaze at at all.
“D —— funny!” Sandy
mused. “Any other night
they’d be thick.”
They returned to the house.
“There’s a bed made for
Jimmy at the fire,” Kate called
out from beneath the blankets;
“an’ there’s some bags at th’
foot for him to throw on
hisself in th’ night if he feels
cold.”
Jimmy assured Sandy he
would be comfortable, and
turned in.
\It7HEN he woke in the morn-
ing the fire was made and
Kate was skipping in and out
getting breakfast ready. Jimmy
wished to rise and be about.
But Kate was in the road. He
watched her movements closely,
and when she went out the
door to yell to Sandy, who was
milking at the yard, that break-
fast was ready, he jumped out,
grabbed his trousers and faced
the fire. Jimmy never in his
life before was in such haste
so early in the morning. He
got one leg in and was dancing
about on it, balancing himself
and kicking and fumbling
with the other when Kate
returned. Jimmy wasn’t a pre-
cocious youth—he was sensi-
tive and shy, and Kate
regarded him more as a son
than anything else. She took
no notice of him, but went
straight to the fire to make the
tea. Jimmy faced the other
way then, and tangled himself
up and fell on the bed. Then
he snatched the blanket and
covered himself again; he
turned red, too, and was in
distress. Kate made the tea,
and turned to the table and
commenced to hum a tune.
After a while Jimmy sat up
and fumbled with the blanket;
and when at last he stood on
his feet his trousers were on.
After breakfast Jimmy
helped Sandy to yoke the
horses ; then took the rifle and
went in search of kangaroos.
Sandy directed him to a spot
where he would find them in
millions.
Jimmy tramped round and
round the paddock, and hunted
about till the rifle felt heavy
as lead and the skin came off
his heels, but saw nothing to
fire at save two little brown
birds and a jew-lizard. He
returned and directed his steps
to where Sandy was running
about behind two horses and a
plough and swearing. Sandy
was surprised to hear there
were no kangaroos about ; he
couldn’t understand it. For

SUNDRY
SHOWS

Art in Perth
A reputed Rubens, brought
to Australia by a private
buyer, Mr. G. W. Murray, of
Mt. Lawley, has recently been
on view at the Claude Hotchin
Gallery—an immense and gory
“Martyrdom of St. John.” It
is filled with anatomical
mastery and the splendor' of
varying textures, but is uneven.
Perhaps the great master
blocked-in the whole, finished
what pleased him, and left his
“workshop” artists to complete
the job.
The same gallery next
showed 30 paintings on loan
from the Benedictine Abbey of
New Norcia. The earliest of
these were an “attributed”
Titian (“The Miracle of Pius
V” —rather stiff and glossy)
and a genuine Raphael “Car-
toon Head of St. John” (in dis-
temper), best offering in the
show —a sketch, perhaps, but
so bold, so sure and flowing in
line, that the flat medium
could not detract from its
vitality.
Amid the host of religious
themes by minor Italian and
Spanish Old Masters a portrait
head of an anguished mother
by Jusepe Ribera (1588-1656),
the Spaniard who belonged to
the Italian “naturalisti” period,
was outstanding—painted with
terrible sincerity, better than
a more noted St. Jerome. Most
appealing was a “Divine
Shepherdess” with attendant
angels and a lovely straw halo-
hat framing her lovely face —
the “unknown” Spanish artist
had the eyes of Botticelli.
After these a visit to the
entries accepted by the Art
Gallery Society of W.A. for
the annual Perth Prize was like
walking into a manufacturer’s
design-studio; it was impos-
sible not to imagine Guy Grey-
Smith’s “Cape le Grande” or
Maurice Stubb’s “Tropical
Fish” or M. A. Carbins’s “Bird
on the Beach” or Brian Mc-
Kay’s “June Tide” or Robert
Juniper’s “Yondi Lifts the
Sky” being used to create
excellent furnishing-fabrics;
indeed, the last had pieces of
hessian stuck to the canvas and
painted over.
In many of these paintings
texture appeared the pre-
dominant interest of the
painters ; but to them texture
means canvas-surface, a mean-
ing altogether different from
that of older generations! Even
many of the more realistic, such
as James Cant’s “Goat in the
Sandhills” and Kath Jarvis’s
“Boys on Jetty,” would have
looked well in petit-point,
whilst others would have made
elegant silks, notably the
winner of the watercolor sec-
tion, “A Situation,” by Indian
artist Gamini Warnesuriya
(Vic.) —a truly exquisite pattern
of figures, so seemingly tradi-
©igngHSM^

D. H. Souter—The ’Nineties
tional as to recall (rightly or
wrongly) the finest Oriental
tissue.
A general impression that the
entries were not up to the
standard of previous years was
heightened by the splitting of
awards. The lOOgns. prize for
the best oil was shared between
Roy Bizley (S.A.), for his
“Spring Landscape”—a pattern-
study in green, but sufficiently
tied to reality to suggest a park
—and Robert Juniper (W.A.),
for his “Image of Kal,” which
may represent the dumps, stacks
and red dirt of Kalgoorlie, but
might equally be a design for
casement-cloth. Irwin Crow’s
“Wonder,” a small girl deli-
cately awed by the sea’s ripples
—nice work marred by an
anaemic grey (drift?) wood
frame —and Maurice Stubbs’s
“The Conversation,” a Spanish
argument in hot yellows and
red barred with black (not
as attractive as his tropical fish)
divided the 50gns. for the best
W-A. painting.
Amongst the watercolors —■
apart from the winner, Eliza-
beth Durack —Louis Kahan
and Romola Clifton showed
refreshingly intelligent com-
ments on aborigines, town and
country respectively. Robin
Phillips had a posterlike but
well-composed “Burnt Forest,”
and James N. Meagher was at
least arresting with his ink-
splashed “From Pure to Im-
pure”—the splash being neces-
sary, one presumed, for
decency’s sake.

Anniversary Abstracts
The Second Anniversary
Exhibition at Sydney’s Clune
Galleries is composed mainly
of abstracts variously
immense, colorful, witty, wild
and experimental. All schools
from most Australian States
are represented; wherever you
go, either ih the large and cool
front room, the corridor or the
back room, canvases trumpet
for attention. Abstracts simply
will not allow you to be
abstracted.
Perhaps this is just as well,
for amidst some of the wilder
efforts it’s refreshing to pause
at Russell Drysdale’s smooth
and heavy stone-shapes in
“Desert Landscape.” Probably
the two most interesting oils
on display are Leonard Hess-
ing’s “Memories of an After-
noon” conflicting mauves,
orange, black and startling
slabs of white, like a techni-
color dream, a flash of some-
thing temporary and vivid—•
and John Passmore’s “Water’s
Edge,” nervous yet reflective,
threatening to break out of its
unresolved confines. Thomas
Gleghorn has “Moondrift,” a
large pastel-piece character-
ised by contrast of line; Judy
Cassab’s “Composition” is,
despite a predominance of soft
blacks, mellow and pleasantly
warm; and the “Dancers” of
Frederic Bates ecstatically try
to leap out of opposite edges
of the canvas.
Robert Curtis’s “Norwegian
Landscape No. 1” is large,
flashing and cluttered, quite
unlike one’s imagined Norway,
and in “Guided Missile”
Michael Doyle revels in
mathematical impersonality.
♦♦♦
If more artists took to the
open road like John Rowell,
showing his year’s output at
Melbourne Athenaeum, there
might or might not be better
pictures, but at least some slight
brake would be applied to the
prevailing tendency of artists
to take short trips into the
world of abstraction. Rowell
has this year hitched his
motorised bluey through
darkest N.S.W. and lightest
Queensland. He catches the
tropical sunshine very nicely.
“The Sun Breaks Through”
seems hot, and “The Wet
Season,” with its sinister
cloudscape, looks as if it is
going to be wet. “Pineapple
Farms, Woombye” appears
to be an essay in the abstract,
but perhaps pineapple-farms
are like that.

Siamese institution, but it is
also as French as the Eiffel

of it used to be practised in

two Siamese exponents of the
art are positively amazing : so
are the Chinese jugglers and
the contortionist who does his
stuff while reposing in the fiery
mouth of a dragon. Cornelio
Balangue plays three mouth-
organs simultaneously' with his
nasal organ after the manner
of the Dyak nose-flute, and
he makes this feat more
remarkable by devouring a

Paul and Gorin
Many of the sublime and
epic qualities of Beethoven's
tremendous Ninth w r ere cap-
tured by conductor Tibor Paul
and the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra at the special con-
cert at the Town Hall last
Saturday night. Paul began it
with great elan, wringing every
emotion from the cosmic drama
of the first movement. It was a
true tour de force, and some
of the best conducting Paul has
given us.
The scherzo the master's
supreme effort in the form —
had in it more of the grim than
the Falstaffian laughter, and
was a slight let-down after
what had gone before. But in
the adagio Paul came back
with full authority. This was
brooding, meditative serenity
and luscious tone, with string
and woodwind choirs in top
form.
The choral movement has
for 135 years been a bone of
contention among the pundits:
whether it was a stroke of
genius or a gross artistic
blunder. On Saturday night it
got the affirmative vote. Some
of it is admittedly unsympa-
thetic to the solo voices. The
by then totally-deaf composer,
never at home with the human
as much as with the instru-
mental voice, sometimes pushes
the singers to odd lengths. But
the baritone, after the wonder-
ful orchestral introduction, is
given a magnificently dramatic
entry'—a piece of ringing
declamation, of which bass-
baritone Noel Melvin took
full advantage. The other
three soloists —soprano Heather
McMillan, tenor Raymond
MacDonald and contralto
Heather Kinnaird —also gave
good accounts of their airs,
both solo and in concert. The
Hurlstone Choir gave a clean
and disciplined tope to the
choruses, though the tenor
section needed more weight
and forthrightness.
Russian - American Igor
Gorin, in the first half of the
concert, drew upon a full bari-
tone of splendid timbre and
rich resonance in a brace of
Haydn songs, including the
thoughtful “She Never Told
Her Love." notable for smooth
legato phrasing; songs by
Monteverdi and Handel; and
a magnificently sung “O
Creation's Day.” Roderigo’s
big aria from “Don Carlos.”

A little healthy cynicism
mingles with a lot of phony
sentiment in this screenplay
about a young man who runs

amusement of his middle-aged
editor, who for 10 years has
nursed a sour grudge against
the world in general and his
wife in particular because she
was once unfaithful to him.
Action is slow and dialogue
ponderous except when the
editor is handing it out. Mont-
gomery Clift brings a confus-
ingly fuzzy and hesitant style
of acting to the role of the
columnist; Robert Ryan is at
least authoritative as the
editor, and Myma Loy is ade-
quate as his wife.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Commercial Bank of Australia, Ltd.
IN our capital-hungry economy, the rate
of interest on bank fixed-deposits has
lagged behind that on alternative invest-
ments such as debenture-stock in h.-p.
companies. In spite of a more liberal
credit-climate, promoted by the reversal
of the special-account mechanism in
March, 1958, the main attraction of bank-
scrip to investors continues to rest in the
very high degree of security to both
capital and income, and in the hope that
one day banks will be able to realise,
income-wise or capital-wise, on the
undoubted undervaluation of their assets.
The private banks, because their bank-
ing operations are subject to Government
regulation under the Banking Act, have
been forced into side-investment in the
h.-p. business. In it they have found an
expanding and profitable outlet for
funds, and a welcome supplement to the
restricted sources of traditional banking
revenue.
A new channel for investment was
opened-up for the trading-banks when the
Commonwealth Bank appointed author-
ised dealers in the short-term money-
market. Funds lodged with authorised
short-term dealers have increased by
about a third from an initial £18.2 million
in March this year to £24.3 million at
the end of June.
However, the short-term funds still
represent only 2.65 per cent, of the total
advances and discounts of all the private
trading-banks at the end of last June.
The greatly improved overseas-funds
situation, and the mabked upward trend in
wool prices, are reflected in the lower
level of advances in the first half of
1959.
At the end of last June, the total of
advances and discounts of all private
trading-banks stood at £916.3 million,
which is £29.3 million lower than at the
same time last year. Allowing for the
diversion of loanable funds to the short-
term dealers, the figure is still £5 million
lower. In percentage terms this is only a
tiny fall, but it does indicate a stationary
position, rather than movement upwards.
The figures were consistently lower in
each month of the first two quarters of
1959.
On the whole, the C.B.A. had a good
year. The total number of branches and
agencies has risen to 782. The bank
handles about 10| p.c. of the private
trading-bank business in Australia, and
has a wide Maoriland connection.
The C.B.A. has a 45 p.c. interest in
General Credits, Ltd., a major h.-p. firm.
Last year wasn’t a particularly good one
for General Credits, but this did not affect
C.B.A.’s earnings. On the contrary, the
div.-cheque from General Credits had
actually increased, following the raising
of the div.-rate from 10 p.c. to 1 If p.c.:

* In addition, there has been a regular preference
dividend of 4 p.c. ( £84,694) each year.
The C.B.A.’s net profit at £591,982 was
£29,114 higher, and included £137,380
divs. received from General Credits. Dis-
closed net profit from banking operations
is really lower than in the preceding year.
A steady £50,000 has been written-off the
bank premises. After covering the 4 p.c.
pref.-div. charge (£84,694), return on ord.
capital was 12.3 p.c. The divs. remained
steady at 10 p.c.
Advances rose by £2,487,617, which
suggests that the C.B.A. is getting a larger
slice of the business now being done by
all banks.
At June 30 last, combined liquids and
special-accounts deposits equalled 46.1
p.c. of the deposits. This is up on the
44.7 p.c. at previous balance-date:

The bank has £2,117,350 of 4 p.c. prefs.
at its disposal, paying for it a modest 4
p.c. This is a significant source of relat-
ively cheap funds, seeing that C.B.A. is
now earning Ilf p.c. from its h.-p.
venture into General Credits.
The £9,930,558 jump in liquid assets is
accounted for by a £3,375,000 investment
in the domestic short-term money-market,
and by large rises in the holdings of Aus-
tralian Government securities and bills
receivable and remittances in transit.
However, money on short-term in Lon-,
don dropped by £562,500 to £3,750,000.
Book-values of bank-premises are
£340,098 higher at £6,014,635. The visible
expenditure on fixed-assets for the year
was £390,098.
Last week, C.B.A. 10s. ords. were
traded at 21s. Hd. each. The yield, on
the basis of a 10 p.c. div., is 4.7 p.c. The
£lO 4 p.c prefs are quoted well below par
at £6|, yielding 5.8 p.c.
Net tangible backing works out at
about • 19s. 6d. for the ords., and
£47 17s. 2d. for the prefs.
Kandos Cement Co., Ltd.
is a basic industry,
geared to the growth of the national
economy as a whole. It is a major
indicator of the level of business activity,
particularly of industrial expansion.
Long-term planning is an essential
feature of cement-production. This
involves an estimate of the rate of
economic growth over a longish period.
In Australia’s growing economy, with
its ambitious long-range immigration
policy, the cement-producing companies
enjoy a steadily expanding market, even
if temporary recessions may bring about
an occasional slackening of demand
resulting in some excess capacity.
The industry, on the whole, enjoys a
high degree of protection from economic
fluctuations, being closely linked to con-
struction of houses, commercial and
factory premises and long-term major
developmental projects.
In all States except Victoria cement-
production roughly equals demand. The
recently completed additional installa-
tions at Geelong should help to close the
existing gap between demand and
supply in that State, too.
Kandos Cement is a holding-co., in an
equal partnership with Australian
Cement, Ltd., in the producing Aus-
tralian Portland Cement Pty., Ltd. Both
companies hold a £2-million share in the
operating company, and are subject to
much the same considerations and influ-
ences.
In addition to its A.P.C. holding (the
main source of earnings), Kandos has
a £5OOO investment in the Pipe Linings
(Australasia) Pty., Ltd.
Neither Kandos nor Australian
Cement give an' indication of the profits
earned by the operating A.P.C., but these
have been published by other sources
recently, and show earnings, after heavy
tax provisions, of 15.2 p.c. on combined
holding-co. capital.
A.P.C.’s actual earnings have been
generally substantially in excess of

Finance Corp. of Australia, Ltd,
CffiECTACULAR development has been the
keynote of hire-purchase activity
since the war. In 1945 an infant of
doubtful parentage, today a lusty and
legitimate adult, the industry can look
back on an adolescence remarkable for
colorful and dynamic growth. Latest
Commonwealth statistics indicate a
slowing-down in the rate of increase of
h.-p. debt and in the number of new
agreements effected.
The mushroom tempo is giving way to
steadier expansion. The boom is tending
to flatten-out. Failing the advent of new
and as yet unenvisaged stimuli, h.-p. cos.
will be hard put to continue the “sky-
the-limit” profit-growth patterns of past
years.
True, TV, shortly to be introduced to
Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane, will step-
up the rate of increase of new h.-p.
agreements in those cities, but, seen as
contributing to Australia’s already mighty
outstandings, the increase can assume no

more than minor significance, and as a
major spur to overall activity must be
heavily discounted.
Prospects, then, for current and future
terms remain, if less dazzling, quite
sound. The present year should usher
in an era of consolidation and internal
strengthening of h.-p. cos. Competition
should intensify, and moves and counter-
moves by finance cos. could open-up and
provide interesting and perhaps profit-
able fields for the alert investor.
Finance Corporation of Australia,
Ltd., kicked-off to a good start late in
1954. The co. found its feet immediately,
and profits rose in leaps and bounds. Last
year they soared to £152,472, more than
73 p.c. above the 1958 figure of £88,057,
after providing for tax, closely aligned to
profits of £91,247 (up £39,031) and
depreciation £4366 (up £3859):

Despite the higher profits, the earning-
rate on paid capital fell from 17.6 p.c. to
17.4 p.c. following 13.7 p.c. and-16.2 p.c.
in the years 1956 and 1957 respectively.
During the year however, an issue of
1,000,000 10s. ords. at par was made to
shareholders, payable 2s. 6d. on applica-
tion by August 27 (ranking for div. as
from Sept. 1, 1958) and ss. first call pay-
able by June 26, 1959, bringing paid
caital at June 30 last, to £875,000, as
compared with £500,000 at the previous
balance-date. Thus, whilst the earning-
rate on the newly increased capital was
only 17.4 p.c., the earning-rate on capital
actually used during the period was con-
siderably higher at 25 p.c.
Of the profits, £60,417 was paid-out by
way of dividends —the rate has been 10
p.c. since the co.’s inception. The bal-
ance (£92,055) went to reserves, lifting
them from £84,126 to £176,181.
Debenture and deposit borrowing

The extra funds were put to good use:
h.-p. contracts rose to £4,227,015 (up
£1,220,995), and loans, etc., more than
doubled to £3,770,167 (up £2,030,265).
At the same time amounts set aside for
unearned income were lifted by £315,944
to £690,682. At this level they are equal
to 16.3 p.c. of h.-p. outstandings, and
indicate that the co. is making sufficient
deduction from earnings for charges, etc.,
relating to future periods. The ratio of
debentures and deposits to shareholders’
funds stands at 6.6 to 1, and as such is
not unduly high for this kind of busi-
ness. Financed outstandings are nine
times greater than paid capital, again a
normal state of affairs in the h.-p. game.
Sponsored, initially, by Automobile
Finance Co., Ltd., which brought along
valuable connections with the Weymouth
(Adelaide) group of car- and tractor-
distributors, F.C.A. was soon under the
protective wing of the Bank of Adelaide,
the bank, with a 40 p.c. shareholding,
being joined by Adelaide retailer John
Martin and Co., Ltd., and Pope
Industries, Ltd., as substantial share-
holders. Automobile Finance was taken-
over by its erstwhile protege in January,

1958, and is now a wholly-
owned subsidiary of F.C.A.
F.C.A. is the largest finance
organisation constituted in
South Australia. Till recently
its operations were confined
within the home State, but this
policy has been set aside “to
satisfy an ever-increasing de-
mand from the eastern States,”
and branch offices were opened
last year in Melbourne, Sydney
and Brisbane. Originally the
co. provided finance facilities
for the acquisition of motor-
vehicles, tractors, farming and
horticultural equipment, in-
dustrial machinery and
domestic appliances, but two
years ago it extended its range
of activities to the real-estate
sphere, financing first-mortgage
loans on land and second-mort-
gage loans on housing. The
volume of business last term
was substantially higher than
that attained previously, and
was a reflection of expansion
achieved by the co., especially
by its newly.instituted branches.
Buyers on the Adelaide
’Change expressed their con-
fidence in the co. last week by
offering 235. 6d. for the f.-p.
10s. ords., for a return of 4.3
p.c. from a 10 p.c. distribu-
tion. Including the new scrip
as paid to 7s. 6d. only, there
was 245. in net tangible assets
at balance-date for every £ of

Tn the last eleven years the
A Australian motor - vehicle
industry has progressed from
body-building to complete
manufacture of vehicles. It is
now capable of satisfying most
requirements of the domestic
market for commercial and
passenger vehicles.
Total investment in the
industry is now more than
£lOO million, and develop-
mental projects in hand are io
the tune of another £37 million.
Australia is a very car-
minded country. By the begin-
ning of March, 1959, there
were 2f-million vehicles on the
road. Australia (with N.Z.)
follows the U.S. and Canada as
the third nation in the world
for vehicles per head of popu-
lation, and seventh on the basis
of comparison of the number
of vehicles in use.
At present the rate of pro-
duction and assembly is slightly
more than 240,000 vehicles a
year, which is a bit less than
in 1958.
In 1958 the demand for
motor-vehicles was estimated
as more than 10 p.c. higher
than in 1957 238,000 new
vehicles were registered during
the year.
In the first quarter of 1959
the number of new registra-
tions was about 5 p.c. higher
than in the same period of
1958. Since then there was a
slight easing in demand.
Second-quarter figures are a
shade below last year’s level,
General Motors - Holden’s
has continued to dominate the
scene. Its share of registra-
tions of all motor-vehicles in
Australia was 39.3 p.c, in 1956,
46.2 p.c. in 1957, 50.0 p.c. in
1958 and 48.7 p.c. in the first
quarter of 1959. G.M.-H.
leadership is particularly
prominent in the sales of
station-waggons, which are be-
coming increasingly popular.
These facts are reflected in

The Eagers group of
G.M.-H. distributing and ser-
vicing companies was incor-
porated as a public holding-co.
in Brisbane on April 17, 1957,
with a capital of £1,100,000
split in 10s. ords. The group’s
operational network covers
Brisbane, Toowoomba, Towns-
ville and Mackay.
In the first year after its in-
corporation as a public com-
pany the Eagers group earned
20.3 p.c. on paid capital, and
paid a 124 p.c. dividend (in-
cluding 24 p.c. bonus-div.):

The twelve months to April
30 this year were marked by
continuing intense competition.
However, with G.M.-H. con-
fidently leading the market, the
co. succeeded in maintaining
its pace. Consolidated profit
for the year was £203,520,
equal to a rate of 18.4 p.c. on
the paid capital, and comfort-
ably covering the steady 124
p.c. div.
The profit was arrived at
after providing £46,435 (up
£2201) for depreciation and
£140,500 (down £16,600) for
taxation. Reserves benefited
by £66,020.

group to be comfortable.

profits total £269,103. There

At balance-date the book-value
of fixed-assets was £16,010
down at £859,998. This puts
the visible capital-expenditure
on land, plant and premises at
£30,425 for the year. Stocks
at £747,499 show a rise of
£23,102. Debtors were £35,871

£97,722 higher at £294,519.
Among the liabilities there
is a £32,500 secured loan from
A.KI.P. Society, which is the
only secured borrowing.
Sundry creditors were £8673
less at £728,863, including

Current assets exceeded
current liabilities by £679,105,
making the current ratio 1.93.
Net tangible assets-backing
was approximately 12s. 6d. for

The first two years of trad-
ing show that Eagers, with its
Holden franchise, is one of the
successful motor-distributors in
Queensland. Its connection
with G.M.-H. has been an
important element in the
success thus far achieved. This
factor will probably be even
more important in the future.
Miauri (Papua) Again
[From L, Owen]
any desire to rake-
over the dead ashes of
the Miauri pyre, I must pro-
test against the form which
Dr. Raggatt’s replies to my
articles have assumed (B.
19/8/’59).
What I did (B. 29/7/’59)
was to quote the state-
ment of a past chairman
of Papuan Apinaipi that the
lower part of the Miauri bore-
hole was sunk under protest
and against the advice of the
co.’s resident geologist. I
made that quotation in good
faith as —as far as my infor-
mation goes—its accuracy was
never questioned.
If that statement was, in fact,
inaccurate, the correction should
have been made at the time. The
excerpt from the press report
of the third annual meeting of
P.A.P. is quite irrelevant when
dealing with a protest against
the continuation of drilling
after the well had passed
through a considerable thick-
ness of igneous rock. Irrele-
vant, also, are the telegrams
exchanged near the end of
July, 1941, between Barrow
and Raggatt, when the well was
nearing abandonment, although
the wording of Barrow’s tele-
gram of 22/7/’4l suggests
that departmental pressure to
drill below- 2000 ft, had been
exerted.
The files of the Bureau of
Mineral Resources, dealing
with the Miauri drilling during
the first half of 1941, should
throw light on this matter,
although— to be historically
accurate —the bureau was not
in existence at that time. The
general term “Dr. Raggatt’s
department,” however, coversi
what is now known as the
B.M.R. at the several stages of
its evolution, and the descrip-
tion “8.M.R.” is not open to
misconstruction when dealing
with the Miauri drilling.
Incidentally, an examination
of the cores recovered from a
scout slimhole bore, which I
sank near the Miauri Marsh,
indicated several changes in
rock-type not followed by “a
more marked formational
change,” and the agreed trans-
fer of operations to N.E. 3 was
a reversion to the policy
recommended by me before I
left P.A.P.
It was very unfortunate that
my Oiapu No. 1 well, located
near N.E. 3, was lost, after I
had left Papua, through inade-
quate drilling technique, at a
depth very considerably above
any zone then considered by
me as likely to produce
commercial oil.

Great Western Consolidated,
N.L., sinking the internal shaft
at Copperhead, W.A., were
accentuated during the year
ended March 31, 1959, and
resulted in heavy expense and

costs rose from 10s. a ton to
19.25. a ton. Write-off for
development redemption in-

a second or two he stood,
scanning the tree-tops waving
over the wire fence.
“Gen’ally a bear or two
about here,” he said, scraping
the dust off himself. “Don’t
seem to be any ter-day, though.”
Jimmy said it didn’t matter,
and he looked as if he spoke
the truth. Jimmy was getting
tired of kangaroo shooting-
tired of the bush altogether.
“Have a go at drivin’?”
Sandy suggested cheerfully.
“Leave y’r rifle here and take
the reins for a while and see
how y’ get on.”
Jimmy said he didn’t mind
trying—but he didn’t say it
with any enthusiasm; and in
a weary sort of way stood up
and took the reins. Sandy
yelled at the horses ; they woke
up and made a rush at differ-
ent intervals. The plough
jumped, stopped, jumped again,
then scratched along after
them. Jimmy tried to keep up
with it —he limped, stumbled,
jumped over some clumps of
burr and tripped against dry
cornstalks that hadn’t been
cut. Sandy continued to yell
at the horses, struggling all the
time to keep his footing. A
withered pumpkin-vine that
seemed to be growing all over
the paddock, with numerous
small pumpkins dangling to it,
got twisted round one of
Jimmy’s legs. Jimmy kicked
frantically to free himself of
it and fell down.
The horses dragged him
along till he got up again.
Sandy didn’t notice him ; he
was battling hard to keep the
plough in.
“To y’! —To y’! ” Sandy
called when the black mare left
the furrow. Jimmy pulled the
wrong rein. “Damn it! ” Sandy
shouted, losing his temper —
“to y’.” Jimmy pulled the
wrong rein some more ; then
Sandy threw the handles down
savagely and cried: “Blarst it,
what’s th’ good o’ that ?” and
'snatched the reins from Jimmy
and nearly dragged the heads
off the horses.
—1903
A lump came into Jimmy’s
throat, and while the spade
was falling heavily on the
rumps of. the horses he stole
away, feeling mistaken and
disappointed in Sandy, the
friend of his father. Near the
house he met Kate coming
along with a can of tea and
some scones and butter for
Sandy’s “eleven-o’clock.” Kate
was red with the heat and the
haste she was making, but was
cheerful as a book-agent. She
pressed Jimmy to return to the
plough and have some tea.
But Jimmy wasn’t hungry, and
said he would sooner “mooch
about a bit.” Kate showed
him where he would find
Uncle. “He’s always there,”
she added. “Nothing’ll shift
him /”
Jimmy went to the house
and put the rifle away ; then
sat in the shade of the
veranda and felt lost and
lonely. Not a soul about;
scarcely a sound audible!
Jimmy wondered how any one
could live in such a place, and
began to think of home and
the town. Some fowls and a
few turkeys came round,
stretched their necks and took
side-glances at him, then moved
away again. Jimmy rose and
went in search of Uncle. He
found him snoring in the
“retreat” —an old tent patched
with rag and bagging, standing
some distance from the house.
Sandy sometimes used it as a
store-room. At the sound of
Jimmy’s voice Uncle woke up
with a start, but when he saw
it wasn’t a policeman or a
bushranger he drew his legs up
to give him room to sit on the
corner of the bunk, and,
settling himself, went calmly
off to sleep again. Jimmy
stared hard at Uncle, then at
a cat slumbering on top
of a bag of flour near his head,
which was all the tent con-
tained. Large flies buzzed
about like bees, and Jimmy felt
lonelier than before.
“How far is it from here to
the train?” he asked.
No answer. Uncle was fast
asleep.
Jimmy touched him on the
bare foot. “Hey,” he said,
“how far”
V\/ - hip-cracks and men's
voices shouting sounded
close to the tent. Jimmy
rushed out. Two horsemen
were in the grass-paddock
wheeling a wild-looking black
bull toward Sandy’s yard.
Foam was flowing from the
bull’s nostrils and mouth, and
his blood was fairly up.
“Look out there,” the men
shouted when Jimmy showed
himself. “Look out! . . .
Keep inside.”
Jimmy sheltered himself
behind a large tree, and got
excited. The bull saw the
tent, and instead of taking
fright went straight at it with
his head down. Jimmy clung to
the tree and yelled a warning
to Uncle. But Uncle was a
hard man to shift. The bull
went right through the tent
and levelled it to the ground.
The cat got a great start. It
raced in three different direc-
tions before remembering
where the house lay ; then to
see it light out! But there was
no word of Uncle. Jimmy
nearly fainted. The horsemen
shouted hilariously, but they
had no idea the tent was
inhabited. The bag of flour
attracted the bull’s attention;
he took it for an enemy, and
dug his horns into it, rooted it
about and bellowed and
breathed into it. The flour
clung to his moist nose and
hide, and went into dough on
him and turned him white.
Meanwhile Uncle had been
lying low, but the bull tramped
on him and he thought it time
then to shift. On hands and
knees he emerged from the
debris and crawled some yards,
then, like a rat forsaking a
log, he made off as fast as
terror and tender feet would
allow in the direction of the
house. The bull caught sight
of Uncle and, despite all
attempts of the horsemen to
frustrate him, went headlong
in pursuit. Uncle had 50
yards to cover to reach the
house ; the bull had 100 yards
to go. Talk about
ment! Neither Jimmy nor
the horsemen could speak.
They stared and trembled.
The bull rattled over the
ground like a racehorse in a
straight. You couldn’t hear
Uncle moving, but he got a lot
out of his arms and head.
“He’ll have him!” one of
the men murmured apprehen-
sively ; “he will . . . he ”
“Done it!” Jimmy burst
out excitedly just as Uncle
threw himself in the back
door, which, happily, was wide
open. Then, almost instantly,
there was a loud crash, and
the bull and the slabs and
the roof of Sandy’s new skillion
were wildly mixed up, and the
animal was plunging madly
about inside with groceries on
his horns.
For a fortnight after Jimmy
was in high spirits, and never
thought of home once.


Start (he day right?
'
•MSBf
The mullet were coming
in. For days a howling
gale had been blowing
from the south, with a
grey blanket of a sky and
heavy masses of darker cloud
sweeping up to break in down-
pours of cold rain. It was a
rain that was fierce and
tumultuous. It blotted out the
sandbanks and the low hum-
mocks of Rathbone Island,
while on the main beach it
limited the horizon to the
foamy crests of the huge
combers that came rolling in
so closely behind one another
that there was nothing visible
but a mass of dirty white. The
tea-tree gullies poured their
floods of stained water out
upon the beach, which was
flattened down and strewn
with mullet-weed, driftwood,
dead fish with their eyes picked
out, and islands of quaking
yellowish foam. In that sudden
convulsion it seemed as if the
sea had vomited up most of its
refuse. Even with the salty
winds blowing spray far inland,
there was a sourish smell in
the air, and the ruffled sea-
birds, tossed from one gust to
another, had the look of crows.
But now the storm was well
over, the sun putting color into
the sea again, clouds turning
white. Lew and the other
fishermen, wandering about
the sandy cliffs in oilskins, kept
their eyes fixed on a spot in
the south-east where the sea-
birds were hovering in wide
circles, dropping to the surface
now and again and fluttering
up with wet wings. The mullet
were moving with the slow-
ness of an iceberg up the coast.
Days before the storm the
scouts had come ahead poking
into creeks and passages and
exploring the ‘spawning-
grounds, and now the main
army was approaching, packed
THE MULLET
[From Vance Palmer’s novel “The Passage,”
winner of the 1929 BULLETIN novel-
competition and serialised in The BULLETIN
in 1930.]
in close formation, with the
birds circling overhead, and
the sharks moving on the out-
skirts in hordes, glutting them-
selves on the helpless mass.
Tt was a time the fishermen
looked forward to as a re-
compense for the lean months.
Yearly, as the winter set-in,
there was this migration of the
mullet to bring them full nets
and easy money. They came
from some spot out at sea and
moved in slow progress north-
ward, shoals of young fish
coming down to meet them
from all the creeks and rivers,
®®gss9§iyas3© ©EKresMiatf
That was the question that
teased the fishermen’s minds
each year as they waited.
Every comber that rose in a
green curve showed thousands
in the moment before it broke,
their outlines as clear as if
seen through the glass of an
aquarium. It seemed as if
they would be tossed up,
gaping and goggle-eyed, on the
beach. But no! There they
were in the next wave, still and
flattened against the trans-
parent, greenish curve. Mean-
while in the deep water, far
out, the sharks tacked to and
fro like silent sheepdogs, the

shoals of others moving off to
spawn in the quiet reaches.
Yet there was something
exasperating in their delibera-
tion as they hung about any
particular spot. An almost
stationary mass, they lay
packed in the deep water,
troubling the surface with their
silvery leaping, driving the
birds to a frenzy of wild
screaming; but would they
come in where a man could
shoot a net around them?
black triangles of their fins
occasionally showing above
the surface.
Lew, muffled up to the eyes
in oilskins, paced the sandy
cliff restlessly as the tides
changed, watching for the first
signs of the shoal going across
the bar. It was desperately
important to him that this
should be a good year. He
had invested his small savings
in a new net and a couple of
boats, and had taken the
Wiegerts, Corny Lait and
Lamont, the oysterman, into
partnership with him on a
share basis. Then he had
brought Tom Rahilly down
from the hotel to help him on
a fixed wage. If the fishing
were good he stood to make
a decent profit that would tide
the family over the next
summer: if it were bad, there
was nothing for it but that
Marnie should come home and
find a job in service some-
where. They had been inquir-
ing about her at the hotel, but
the very thought of her scrub-
bing floors or serving behind
the bar put a darkness into
her mother’s eyes. And
Hughie wasn't able to pay
more than a few shillings yet
for his board.
< W ELL ’ T om ’ what’s it to be?”
’ * he asked Rahilly, as they
squatted behind a clump of
sheoak, shielding their lit
pipes from the wind.
Rahilly let the smoke trickle
from the corner of his mouth.
“Good going; don’t you
worry. In a few days we’ll be
wanting a couple of draught-
horses to haul on the nets.
The scouts had a good spin, so
they’ll come in all right.”
“Yes, the scouts had a good
spin. Not as much as an oar
put in the water while they
were here.”
He had faith in Rahilly’s
assurances, for there was noth-
ing Tom couldn't divine about
the ways and intentions of fish.
Perhaps it was because he was
so much like a fish himself,
with his round, pale eyes that
stood out from his head, and
his mouth that fell open above
a formless chin. A queer-
looking fellow, old Tom, not
very prepossessing at first
sight, but companionable and
friendly! He had knocked
about the lower reaches of the
Passage since he was a boy,
picking-up a living in much
the same way as a sea-hawk,
and finally attaching himself
loosely to the Callaways.
Sometimes he worked on
Tony’s boat, sometimes helped
with the fishing, and some-
times went crabbing by him-
self among the little mangrove
islands. Outside that stretch
of sandy shore and partly land-
locked water the world hardly
existed for him, but everything
he had seen he remembered,
and he could speculate for
hours on how long Rathbone
Island had been divided from
the mainland, and what sort
of life had gone on there
among the blacks a hundred
years before.
Yet it was only in winter

that he really came alive.
Summer was a dream to him,
and he drifted about the yard
of the hotel in his rusty
jumper and bare feet, never
more than half-drunk, and yet
never sober enough for any-
thing but cutting firewood and
cleaning the car.
“I’ve watched ’em for years,”
he said, “and every time the
scouts were monkeyed with
they’ve sheered-off. Funny
how the blasted things can
pass the word along, but they
do as sure as God made little
apples! This time they’ll come
in all right, though.... Damn
it if they’re not beginning to
do it now!”
TTe sprang up and pointed
through the thickening
v dusk to where the mullet were
moving over the bar, leaping as
though from pressure behind,
slowly making progress against
the outgoing current. The
Wiegerts and Corny Lait had
seen them, too, and were
hurrying to the boats moored
on the inside of the Passage,
their nets piled high in the
stern.
“Spot ’em, Lew?” they
called back. “They’re moving
in!”
“More’n a few cases in this
lot! ”
“Come on, boys! Now the
fun begins.”
A boyish excitement spread
through them, even though
they had watched the same
spectacle every winter for
years, and knew it meant end-
less work for them and nights
of broken sleep. The mullet
were moving in! They packed
the narrow bar and spread
through the smooth water
around the sandbanks, sluggish
with the weight of roe, a mind-
less mass of spawning life. In
the shallows they came to rest,
their noses to the current, and
their tails faintly vibrating as
though with the last flicker of
exhausted energy.
During the days that fol-
lowed there was little chance
of a spell for anyone. Time
was not reckoned by the sun
but by the tides, and when the
full flood was on the sand-
banks the boats were out,
whether it was noon or mid-
night. Every shooting of the
nets brought a‘heavy draught
of fish, and the men’s hands
were raw with hauling,
calloused though they had
become with the same work
in previous winters ; but there
was always a thrill of expecta-
tion when the floats narrowed.
Would their luck stick to
them? Or had the fish been
scared back to join the huge
shoal that was already moving
north? They had not. They
could be seen lying in the clear
water at midday, their heads
pointed to the current, their
tails flickering faintly,
wrapped, apparently, in the
profound ecstasy of immo-
bility : they curdled into a
leaping mass of phosphores-
cence at night when the nets
closed about them. And
behind this great shoal would
be other shoals, moving up
the coast in slow procession
till the end of winter, the
sharks around them and the
birds above.
Lew passed about the place
in quiet contentment, drying
and mending nets, seeing about
cases, packing the fish in ice
and getting them off each
morning in Reardon’s truck,
There was something about this
steady, unremitting work that
satisfied the senses, though a
man had to take his sleep at
odd times and never got
enough. He enjoyed even the
i •, f tu ■
long watts for the night tides
on the sandbanks, with Rahilly
curled up at the other end of
the boat, their pipes lit and
neither of them speaking
except when he had something
to say. It was good being
with old Tom; they had
always got along well together!
Some sort of physical corn-
munion existed between them,
and they drew their thoughts
from the same current of life.
When they talked it was of
the things around them—the
way the sandbanks shifted
after every storm, the habits
°f bir *. the «ac‘ times whe "
‘ he ddferatt fish appeared.

The Magic of the Rain
The Reverend Penny-
chook, good simple man,
believing that the
natural phenomenon of
the rain, held back by drought
in its cycle, can be induced to
unseasonable speed by humilia-
tion and prayer, provided the
prayer in the little galvanised-
iron church at Cloncurry —
crackling like sticks in a
furnace —while the meagre
congregation was expected to
provide the humility. He held
forth to them at length on their
iniquities, which he alleged
had made Providence lust for
revenge as if it were human.
Stiff-necked, proud and inso-
lent had they been, said the
Rev. Pennychook, who knew
nothing of their fight against
the elements, their indomitable
courage and their sardonic
humor, which made them
lighten trouble by grinning at
their own.
North of Sampson Hills the
ploughed field was broken by
mad country of clay slate, red-
hot and shingly; by mica
schists set on edge, and letting
fall to every hoof-beat the
powder of “new-chum gold” to
shine like pinheads in the dust.
There were the green of lance-
wood tops and their saffron-
red trunks making a wild
Chinese color-scheme of red
earth and the steel-blue sky
and inexorable sun ; dust impal-
pable as powder and pungent
as pepper; long tracts of
gently-rolling grey , sand ;
dwarfed cabbage-leaf gums
waving across the earth in the
wind, each a vegetable house-
maid sweeping the wilderness
for the guests that never came.

nor a wallaby crossed the
track of Walter Rossitter riding
with Larry the black stockman
through hell to Sampson Hills.
They saw a few great goannas
on the carcases of dead beasts ;
and by a dried-up waterhole
between Seymour River and
Gunpowder Creek they passed
a broken-horned bullock,
lunatic with the long drought
and cursed by a rare vitality
that would not let him die.
“Bad, Larry! ” said Walter
Rossitter for the fiftieth time.
“My word, close up dead
finish all this one,” replied
Larry. “An’ Gunpowder Creek
been dry up altogether that
way.”
He jerked his head east-
ward in illustration.
“What place that one where
ducks been sit down?”
“Where ducks been sit down
one time,” corrected Larry.
“Illy-gilly-afo that one.
Altogether dry up like this one
horse.”
The big black smacked with
his open hand the tucked-up
and hollow flank of the chest-
nut that stumbled under the
weight, the sweat caked into
ridges of salt below the hip-
bones.
“We shifted the Kundi
Kundi cattle just in time,
Larry.”

“More better that one,”
replied Larry, greatly pleased at
the collective foresight of their
own station. “S’pose no been
shiftem altogether die close
up.”
“Rain not come long time
now, Larry?”
Larry glanced at the sky and
replied: “Rain come when
that one ready. When that one
sky been too thirsty, then he
been say, ‘By cripes! I rainem
plenty now.”
“You know blackfeller
makem rain, Larry?”
“One feller Kalkadoon boy
makem rain good feller. I been
knowem that one.”
Walter Rossitter laughed, but
without any pleasure. “You
tellem that one, Larry, s’pose
him been makem rain I givem
two tchillin.”
“All right that one,” replied
Larry, accepting the commis-
sion with due gravity.
Thdy came to a carcass and
flies ; for all the green food and
shelter had gone, and there
were flies only where there was
corruption to batten on. They
rested at sundown in country
as waterless as all the day had
ms&asra —1 919
been—rested only for a little,
for the horses could not feed
in that waste of sterile dust —
and then went on in the cool
night five miles to water. It
was, as Walter Rossitter called
it, not real water, but a hole
filled with meat-extract. They
joined bridle-reins and lowered
quart-pots to the abomination,
watered the horses out of their
hats, and then drank the half-
corruption with beard and
moustaches pulled over the lips
and the teeth clenched to filter
the feathers and animal re-
mains from the fluid that tasted
sweet to their need.
White man and black man
wiped their mouths, looked at
each other in the thick starlight,
and laughed. Thunder rolled
eastward like the sound of far-
off artillery; the lightning
flared ahead. The horses licked
the stones.
The rainmakers of the Kal-
kadoons went through
their service of invocation in
much the same spirit as the Rev.
Pennychook conducted his
service of humiliation and
prayer. The thunder and light-
ning seen and heard by Walter
Rossitter and Larry two nights
before had been marked by
the cleverer men of the rain-
makers, and in the spirit of,
but with more knowledge than,
the Rev. Pennychook, they
read the evidence and prepared
to make the denouement their
own. They set the stage for the
matinee ; for with these people
rain must be made when the
sun is at the meridian. Aiso,
being actors, they could not
play convincingly to an empty
house, and to the station-home-
stead .in the dust-heap that had
been the high-grassed plains of
Sampson Hills they sent an old
gin to tell Larry to invite
Walter Rossitter and all white-
feller to witness their magic of
the rain.
“Rain-making in daylight?”
said Walter Rossitter. “The
Yaroinga always make rain at
night.”
“This one Kalkadoon,” said
Larry.
They found the rainmakers
in the sand where in good
seasons the creek ran a banker.
They were four old men ghastly
with white lines of kopi, their
faces, necks and trunks, back
and front, and their arms down
to the wrists covered with emu-
down cemented to the flesh
with blood. Ypung men were
not in the acting, but stood
back respectfully on the creek-
bank. Beyond the bank, curious
as boys around a circus and
afraid to risk a beating for
entrance under the tent without
a ticket, a few gins were collec-
ted singing of him who can
use the firestick, of the whistler
duck, and the frog, and the
creatures of water ; of blood-
wood blossoms and the flowers
and honey of a good season.
Ahead of the young men at
the creek-bank, but withdrawn
from the rainmakers, was a
sulky, withered, gnarled old
man, his face wrinkled like a
walnut shell. He was a preju-
diced critic before the play
began; he did not like the
actors, the dressing-room under
the metallic sky, nor the
libretto, nor the theatre, nor
anything. He was sure in
advance that the play would
never get across the footlights.
Muttering to himself as he sat
in the sand, he attracted Walter
Rossitter by his general air of
grievance about everything, so
that the manager of Kundi
Kundi asked Larry why the old
man shoulji be displeased.
Larry explained: “Name
that one Mika.”
“The Mosquito—sh! He
looks as if he could sting. What
name he get wild that one?”
“Him been makem rain long
time longa Leichhardt. No
been iikem this Workia rain
song—no been likem all this
feller.”
“He works rain-making on
his own? I see. Ask him why
he no been makem rain now?”
Larry returned with the
information that Mosquito
altogether despised any varia-
tion from the text of his own-
personal incantation, and that,
further, his magic was not yet
ready.
“The spirit doesn’t move him
until the clouds are black,”
said Walter Rossitter to the
manager of Sampson Hills.
“Well, I’ll back that old feller.
He’s very old and his eyes show
more intelligence than these
magicians’ ; but it’s all oppor-
tunism, and these chaps may
hit the bull’s-eye after all.
Hello, the stage-manager is
going to begin.”
'T'he eldest of the old men dis-
guised in blood and emu-
down advanced with the rain-
stick of white wood, the rain-
stones of quartz-crystal
cemented to its top ; hair of a
man’s beard cemented to the
sides, and leafy branches tied
around its lower tip like the
straw of a broom. Another
poured water from a water-
bag into a coolamon ; 'the man
with the rain-stick took the
centre, and the other three
moved around him and the
coolamon, stamping on the
sand. At intervals they dabbled


their hands in the water ; some-
times splashing as if rain were
falling, at others laving their
hands with a vibratory move-
ment to show ripples caused by
fish leaping from deep water.
They waved their arms to show
a flowing river, and cupped
their hands in imitation of
pools; held their thumbs
together to indicate the hinges
of the water-mussel shell, and
moved their clenched fists
inwards and outwards to show
the mussel’s valves. .
The low singing of the gins
had been peremptorily silenced;
the rainmakers became more
earnest in their work, giving
each figure of the magic its full
value and production. The
diver-birds that were not there
in that hell of flame and dust
dived in pantomime in the river
that did not exist except as a
gulf floored with drifting sand.
The frog of the tarrying mon-
soon was represented by closed
thumbs and fingers thrust for-
ward and downward ; then the
fingers widely parted to show
the leap from webbed feet.
Meantime they sang—the
singing of the whistling duck,
while flapping their hands with
the slow, steady movement of
the fowls’ wings. They sang of
katar, the short sweet grass
that grows in the first rains ;
of pigweed and nardoo ; of
yams and lily roots ; of poison-"
ing the water with crushed
leaves of the blue flower to
make fish swoon and bring
them to the surface ; of pelican
and crane ; of water-bags made
of the skins of pady-melon.
They left the rain-stick in the
sand by the coolamon; the
actors ascended the creek bank,
imitating antics and voices of
all the living things made active
and vocal by the rain—the
quack of ducks, the call of the
ibis, the croak of the frog and
the cry of corella and galah.
'"The little cloud on the north
A spread and bellied ; light-
ning came _ out of its womb,
thunder from its presence. The
actors yelled exultantly; be-
hind the creek-banks the gins
held strips of bark, coolamons
and shields as for protection
from the douches of the rain.
The cloud waited sullenly,
discharging its electric load in
lightnings no longer than a
walking-stick, and thunder that
grew more and more distant
until it was nothing. Away to
the south-east, in the crackling
galvanised-iron church, the
Rev. Pennychook preached on
faith and works, on the veng-
eance of the Lord taken on
cattle, and on the urgency of
humiliation and prayer. Within
four days the Rev. Pennychook
had come to the belief that the
Lord had hardened his heart
against Pharaoh so much that
he would not send even a
plague of frogs;. and the
blacks had given-up because
“this one-feller rain too dam’
’toopid altogether.” Then the
aboriginal mechanist of the
Creek Theatre at Sampson
Hills removed the coolamon
and the rain-stick; and the
steel sky burned as if* it hated
the world ; and the broken and
dried country abandoned hope,
and settled down again to the
clutches of the drought.

said he. “Let’s have the old

So they went down to the
creek-bank and found Mos-

naries of his Big Magic, which
From The Bulletin Black-and-white Gallery
B. E. Minns —1911
A fortnight left the sky still
an inverted cup of steel and
'the little life below it gasping ;
and then Mika, or the Mos-
quito, came to Larry—Rossit-
ter still resting at Sampson
Hills —and asked to see the
white men.
The manager at Sampson
Hills told Larry to send
Mosquito away. He had had
“too much of damn’ nigger
foolishness,” he said. But
Walter Rossitter over-ruled
him, kindly but firmly.
“There’s nothing to do,”
is to Little Magic as Know-
ledge is to Superstition.
T>efore proceeding with his
Magic of the Rain, Mika
demanded the fixation of his
reward. He was no impostor—
he had invented a new charm
and would he have one-feller
tchillin if he brought the rain?
To which the station
manager responded that if rain
fell it should be paid for on a
sliding scale, such sliding scale
to slide upward.
“S’pose catchem little feller
rain, s’pose catchem big feller
rain, how much that one?”
asked Mosquito, looking at the
sky and its assembling clouds.
“S’pose catch little feller
rain, one tchillin,” replied the
manager of„ Sampson Hills.
“S’pose catchem big feller rain,
two tchillin.”
“S’pose catchem plurry big
feller flood?” demanded Mika.
“Big feller flood —two
tchillin, plenty ’bacca, plenty
jam, one old-feller pair pants! ”
The magician nodded his
head in satisfaction. A sudden
clap of thunder came as if at
the cue, and Mika, seeing the
clouds hurrying to a wind in
the high vault, though on
earth there was not any breath
or movement, prepared his
medicine, with one eye on the
work and the other on the sky.
Seeing this division of attention
the white men were in no wise
surprised when Mika
announced that the charm
would be long brewing ; for
they saw the clouds opening as
usual and dispersing to the
eastward.
“You see ’em no rain come,
Mika, then you say magic stay
long time. My word, you big
feller damn’ fraud altogether,”
said Walter Rossitter.
“Byemby come—when him
dark,” replied Mika earnestly.
“Byemby rain come —iei, madi,
multa, multana.”
“One—two —three —big-mob
rain,” translated Larry.
'T'he night closed in heavy
and electrical; a big cloud
hung over the homestead like
a great bellying sail. Light-
ning came out of the cloud and
thunder crackled behind it like
matchwood under a pot; the
air was breathless and leaden
as with fear. Larry brought
the white men down to Mika’s
fire on the creek-bank ; Mika
was almost unrecognisable in
his disguise of emu-down glued
to his flesh with his own blood ;
his rain-stick of whitewood, its
broom reduced to a few dying
leaves, he held solemnly over
the grey rift in the earth which
was the creek.
At his feet was a circular
channel in the sand, dug with
a yam-stick; the sand from
the channel was piled high in
the centre as if Mika imitated
the castle and the moat child-
ren dig in the sea-shore. Mika
forced the rain-stick into the
central boss of sand and hold-
ing it by the rain-stone with
his left hand sang in a weak
and wavering voice his rain-
song as he stamped around the
channel, having first poured

A Gum-tree in the Desert
By ERNEST FAVENC
A creek, that is to say,
a depression in the
ground which began
nowhere and, after a
brief course, ran out into
nothing. Its one distinctive
feature amid the surrounding
monotony, a low, ancient,
stumpy, scarred and twisted
gum-tree, of scantiest foliage,
rusty and forlorn appearance,
A tree, large in girth but with-
out heart, the mere mockery
of a shell.
Around, a dull level of
country, neither plain nor
forest. Small belts of mulga,
then clumps of stunted shrubs,
growing on arid soil sparsely
covered with spinifex and the
withered stalks of other
bushes.
But beyond the proud dis-
tinction of a gum-tree, or
“yalloo,” as the aboriginal
inhabitants of that region
w r ould call it, the creek
boasted of a more important
claim to consideration. At the
foot of the little bank, beneath
the gum-tree, grew a few dark-
green reeds, wiry and short.
They grew beside a small and
shallow pool of clear water,
so small that one would think
a single day of the desert sun
would suck it dry. But the
old gum-tree knew better and
had grown-up beside the
only weak, struggling, little
surface spring there was in all
that thirsty land. The water
was slightly brackish and
nauseous to the taste, but for
many miles east, west, north
and south it was the sole store
Nature had provided in all that
desolate region.
The wretched little spring
and the old, coreless tree had
not many visitors. At times,
some of the gaunt, meagre,
ape-like denizens of the great
Western interior would camp
there for a night, halting on
their journey across some
wide, dry stretch, but there
was no game to tempt them
to linger. At other times
parrots, pigeons, or a tired and
worn-out kite came in and
drank and rested in the
branches of the old yalloo,
then hastened on to a more
promising land ; but, as a rule,
the old tree and little spring
were lonely, silent and un-
visited.
It was the time of day when
the old gum-tree cast no
shadow, when the wrathful
sun looked straight down on
the scorched earth, and the
earth lay pulseless and faint,
that a dark object came limp-
ing painfully through the cruel
spinifex towards the lone
spring. It was a miserable old
black gin helping her thin,
decrepit legs along with a yam-
stick not much thinner than
they. A poor creature,
abjectly bent and worn, with
scaly skin, blear eyes and the
ribs of a skeleton. How she
had missed her fellows and
turned off to this soak-hole,
led by some old instinct, it
would be hard to say ; perhaps
a bad cut in one of her feet
would account for it, but she
came hobbling on, until she
reached the place and sank
down beside the water.
Even then she did not act as
a white would have done, and
plunge her face into the
mawkish, tepid stuff; but
scraped a hole alongside for
the water to drain into
through the sand ; then she
drank some sparingly, and lay
there a while with the sun
beating on her poor old limbs
and body. Revived a little,
she arose, went to an old
camping-place, and rubbed
some ashes into the sore on
her foot; then, from her miser-
—1893
able dilly-bag, took out some
roots and a few fresh-water
mussels. This was her meal,
which she vainly tried to sup-
plement by searching in the
damp mud at the foot of the
bank for more mussels.
At the foot of the old tree
was an aperture in the shell
about the size of the entrance
to a dog-kennel or the man-
hole of a tank. Into this the
old gin crept, apparently
knowing the place, and coiled
herself up to rest and sleep.
'Two hours of drowsy heat,
of sultry calm, of unbroken
stillness; then, through the
haze that rises with the coming
of the afternoon, loomed other
figures—men and horses.
Two white men, with a
couple of pack-horses, wild-
eyed, with tucked-up flanks,
rode towards the old tree.
Some distance away they
pulled-up and one went ahead
alone. When he saw the water
he waved his hat and the other
followed; then they hastily
unpacked and unsaddled, and
the thirsty horses ran down to
the water. There was not
much more than room for
them all to drink at once.
“That was a stroke of luck,”
said one of the men. as they
stood looking at the horses,
“catching sight of the old tree.
You can generally bet on a
little water of some sort where
a yalloo of this kind grows.”
“Think there will be enough
for them?”
“Yes, this must be a bit 7 of
a spring, for there’s been no
rain since the country was
made, I think,” and he looked
significantly at the parched
surroundings.
“We had better camp here,
I suppose?”
“By Jove, yes, and spell to-
morrow, too, after such a
tying-up as the mokes have
had.”
“Not much feed.”
“They’ll pick-up something
amongst the mulga over
there.”
By this time the horses had
finished, and the little hole was
drained dry for the first time.
“It will fill again, slowly of
course, but there’s plenty of
soakage still in this bank,”
said one.
They hobbled the horses,
made a fire, and camped by
the old tree, which now cast a
long shadow.
Tnside the trunk the quak-
ing gin had been awakened
by their coming —had, even
with her rheumy eyes, recog-
nised through a crack ' the
dreaded strangers once or twice.
seen before at a distance.
Night had set-in, the tired
men slept, but the wretched
creature could not escape even
had she had courage, for the
pack-bags and saddles were
heaped against the hole by
which she had entered.
Slowly the moon rose and
lit-up the scene, and from
amongst the long shadows it
cast crept forth other darker
shadows, and stole towards the
camp.
~ Blacks, even the most abject,
do not desert their sick, old,
or crippled, and some had
come back to look for the
crippled gin. But the white
men were sleeping at the tree,
and although, at last, embold-
ened by necessity, they crept
in to drink at the water, the
wretched prisoner could not
let them know of her presence,
even had she been aware of
theirs. The men slumbered
unscathed, the blacks departed ;
and morning broke, dewless
and oppressive.
“Phew!” said one of the
two men, “Look at the niggers’
tracks on top of our horse-
tracks. Wonder they didn’t
knock us on the head last
night.”
“Some gins, I suppose,
sneaking in for water,”
returned his companion.
“They travel at night very
often in this dry country.”
>r
All that day the men
lourtged about, and the in-
side of the old tree was like an
oven, and the frightened
creature nearly shrieked when
one with a tomahawk com-
menced chopping his initials
on the outside.
Night once more, and when
the moon was high one of
the men started and roused his
companion.
“What the deuce did you
groan like that for?”
“Did I groan? Must have
been dreaming.”
“Don’t dream like that
again. I never heard such
a groan —you ought to sell it.”
Next morning they saddled-
up and left, and the tree and
the trampled spring were soli-
tary once more.
It was many years after
settlement of the neighboring
“available” country that the
old yalloo succumbed to a
high wind preceding a thunder-
storm, and toppled over. And
again, some time after that,
a man from one of the
stations, visiting the spring,
looked into the hollow trunk
of the fallen tree and found
an old mummy huddled-up,'
nose and knees together. The
remains were sent away as a
great curiosity, and an author-
ity on ethnology wrote a very
clever paper proving that this
method of “tree-burial” was
analogous to that practised
in many other parts of the
world a few thousand years
ago, and it exactly fixed the
era of development arrived-at
by these Australian aborigines.

Registered Design No. 37210.
Still Priced Within The Range
Of EVERY FLOCKOWNER
THIS PRESS HAS THESE
OUTSTANDING FEATURES:
STRENGTH ! The completely engineer designed box
with its powerful angle iron bearers and semi tubed slats is the
standard "AJAX." Since 1938, over 21,000 sheep men with
100,000's of bales, many over 500 lbs., have proved this strength.
When pressing, the pull is taken on a special imported H inch
STEEL CORE wirerope, needing no turn buckles or weak links.
SPEED! The ingenious framework efficiently handles the
monkey in and out of the press, with ease and speed, cutting
minutes off each bale.
The hydraulic hand pump with its double pistons ensures maxi-
mum speed with effortless pressing.
MOBILITY " The addition of five inch wheels makes this
press as simple to move from bin to bin as the standard "Ajax."
THE HYDRAULIC GEAR: After fifty years
experience in this country in shearing sheds and with wool presses
in particular, we have designed and are manufacturing in our
own factory, the powerful twin piston pump, cylinder and ram.

OF SERVICE PROBLEMS.
The pump is encased in the sealed oil reservoir, doing away with unnecessary
of fluid and evaporation of oil from one shearing season to another. A MINIMUM
The double piston means double pumping and so more speed and less effort.
The pump has a huge capacity. During the last fifty bales put through the test mode!, a bale of 524 lbs. of
stained pieces was pressed with the pump at less than three quarters capacity.
ONE presser with a lad throwing the wool from the bin, pressed five bales in thirty five minutes.

many hundreds of prosperous
farmers and the economic
mainstay of flourishing towns.
In December, 1908, no fewer
than 1654 agricultural selectors,
the majority with families and
holding among them 1909
selections, were settled upon
what had been a few years
previously 26 sheep- and cattle-
stations. with a handful of
employees.
In 1901 occurred the Federa-
tion of the six colonies in the
Commonwealth of Australia,
and the colony of Queensland
became the State of Queens-
land.
The first decade of the 20th
century saw considerable
development of primary and
secondary industries. By 1910
Queensland was depasturing
over 20-million sheep and over
five-million cattle. The wool
clip totalled 139,250,000 !b.
worth nearly £6 million. Over
94.000 acres was under sugar-
cultivation and 211.000 tons
of raw sugar was produced.
There were over 1500 manu-
factoring establishments with
an output of £ls million. -
Steel Rails Link State
In 1909, Queensland's
jubilee Year, the Government
of which William Kidston was
Premier initiated the biggest
railwav-programme in the
State's history—extension of
the North Coast railway to
Cairns, and the construction
of the trans-State Great
Western railway with connec-
tions to the coast, and seven
short railways to develop agri-
cultural districts. Completion

Northern systems, and made
it the main trunk from Bris-
bane to Cairns.
kidston was also responsible
for a landmark in Queensland's
educational progress the
University Act of 1909 which
established and endowed the
University of Queensland. The
University opened in March,
1911, with 60 students. The
field of secondary education
was appreciably widened soon
afterwards with the establish-
nient of State High Schools. A
central technical college had
been established in Brisbane
in 1908 ; technical colleges in
the provincial centres were
subsidised by the State.
Labor’s Advent
At the general election of
May 22, 1915, Digby F.
Denham's Liberal Government
was defeated, the Labor party ,
led by T. J. Ryan, a brilliant
young lawyer who had first
entered Parliament in 1909,
being swept ifito power with
a large majority. With the
exception of the three-years’
term of Arthur Edward
Moore's Country-National
Government, the Labor party
dominated the political stage
in Queensland for the next 42
years.
Ryan’s Ministry, which
included two future Labor
Premiers. William McCormack
and Edward Granville Thee-
dore, embarked on an elabo-
rate programme of radical,
social and industrial reforms,
Among measures introduced
were establishment of the
Arbitration Court, a Workers'
Compensation Act. a liberal-

mines, as a result of which the
State invaded the fieid of trade
and competed with private
enterprise. The majority of
these State enterprises, with the
notable exception ol the State
Insurance Otnce. proved to be
financially disastrous,
In 1920-21 the Theodore
Labor Government succeeded
in abolishing the Upper House,
the Legislative Council, by the
device of swamping the Coun-
cd with its own appointees,
colloquially and cheerfully
known as The Suicide Club.
The Act was proclaimed on
March 23, 1922, and since
July 4 of that year the
Queensland Legislature has
functioned as a single Cham-
her, the Legislative Assembly,
During Theodore's term as
Premier (1919-1925) taxation
was greatly increased to finance
ambitious plans for land-
settlement and also for irriga-
tion and water-conservation,
He introduced legislation to
raise the rentals due from pas-
toral companies for leasehold
properties. The companies,
which had offices in London,
claimed that the action of the
Theodore Government was a
repudiation of contract, and
organised a financial boycott
of Queensland. Theodore
broke the blockade by 7 borrow-
ins in New York.
Aviation and Radio
In the ’twenties radio and
aviation were coming into
prominence; 1922 saw the
birth of the famous aviation
service of Queensland and
Northern Territory 7 Aerial
Services fQ. A.N.T.A.S3, which,
beginning with flying routes
in outback Queensland, has
grown into an international
airline spanning five contim-
eats. On November 2, 1922,
the first airmail in Queens-
land's history was carried from
Charleville to Cloneurry. la
1928 the Grand Old Man of
the Australian Outback, the
Reverend Dr. John Flynn of
the Australian Inland Mis-
sion. inspired Qantas to
inaugurate the Flying Doctor
Services unique to Australia,
but a blessing to thousands of
sufferers over the years.
In March. 1923, a penoi-
less prospector, John Camp-
bell Miles, discovered silver-
lead at Mount Isa, in north-
west Queensland. Develop-
meot of the field began in
192//. On May 4, 1931, the
Mount Isa mine created the
first skip of ore ; the first blast-
furnace was blown-in on June
8 of the same year; and on
June 19 the first consignment
of silver-lead left Mount Isa.
A landmark in the history
of municipal government was
reached in 1925, when Greater
Brisbane was created by the
City of Brisbane Act, passed
in 1924. All local author!-

20 aldermen were elected by
their respective wards. The
Brisbane City 7 Council has
greater annual revenues than
the State of Tasmania. The
current Budget is more than
£2B million, including £6-
million new loan-money for
works and services. It is the
largest metropolitan area in
the British Commonwealth
and conducts its own elec-
tricty, tram- and bus-transport

Conquest of fee Demon
Pear
The year 1925 was also to
have notable significance for
Queensland's land economy.
It saw 7 the beginning of an
epic of biological control —
the conquest by 7 the South
American moth, Cactoblastis
cactorum , of enormous areas
of pricklv-pear infestation in
Queensland. Approximately
2750 eggs of the moth'were
imported from Buenos Ares
ie 1925. Within five years
the pear variety OpsumSi/a iner-
mis was destroyed, and Cacto-
Mastis * had reclaimed 25-
irtillioiri acres of densely-
infested pear-land for agricul-
tural production, dairying, and
cattle- and sheep-raising. The
recovery of this “'lost province”
to Queensland has been worth
many millions of pounds to
the economy of the State-
In May, 1929, the Mc-
Cormack Labor Government,
which had aroused the hos-
tility of industrial unions by
its handling of the railway
strike of September. 1927, was
decisively defeated at the polls
fey the Country-National
party. For the next three years
Arthur Moore’s Country*
National Ministry held office,
but at ’ the 1932 elections
Labor, under the leadership
of W. Forgan Smith, was
swept back into power. 8
Depression and Recovery
With Queensland, like the
rest of Australia, gripped by
the great depression of the
early ’thirties, the Forgan
Smith Ministry instituted a
bold plan of public works,
water-and-sewerage schemes
and building projects. Money
was raised through the Bureau
of Industry, which was estab-
lished as a constructing

authority. State works imple-
mented under this scheme
were the Somerset (Stanley
River) Dam, Mackay Harbor
improvements and the Story
Bridge across the Brisbane
River. The magnificent Uni-
versity Building at St. Lucia,
considered to be the finest in
the Commonwealth, was begun
in 1937. The State Electricity
Commission, which set in train
a co-ordinated plan of elec-
trical development, was also
established.
Tbe outbreak of the Second
World War in 1939 made an
impact on Queensland to
a much greater extent than
any other State. General
MacArthur established for-
ward Allied base-headquarters
in the capital, and by 1943
there were more than a million
people living in and around
Brisbane including the civilian
population and the many mili-
tary camps for Australian,
American and other Allied
troops.
The war also gave a great
impetus to industrial and eco-
nomic development as a result
of the great shortage of
consumer - goods. Post - war
progress in secondary industry
was considerable, and has
shown a constant upward
trend. Shipbuilding has de-
veloped as a major industry
in both Brisbane and Mary-
borough.
Under the direction of E. M.
Hanlon, who held the Minis-
terial portfolio of Health and
Home Affairs in the Forgan
Smith and Cooper Ministries,
the hospital, motherhood and
child-welfare services of the
State underwent considerable
expansion.
Free hospital services, unique
in Australia, date from 1946,
when in co-operation with the
Commonwealth, Queensland
introduced the Hospital
Benefits scheme providing'for
free inpatient treatment in
public wards for all persons.
During Hanlon’s term as
Premier (March, 1946-January,
1952) a number of large public
works, including the Burdekin
and Tully hydroelectric
schemes and the Mareeba-
Dimbulah irrigation projects,
were initiated.
The End of a Chapter
Labor's long period of office
in Queensland ended on
August 3, 1957, when the
Government led by Vincent C.
Gair was shattered, as a result
of the split which had occurred
in the Labor party over the
demand of the Queensland
Central Executive of the Aus-
tralian Labor Party that the
Government should immedi-
ately introduce three weeks’
annual leave for all workers.
Mr. Gair was expelled from
the A.L.P., and he and nine
of his ten Ministers, the excep-
tion being Mr. J. E. Duggan
(Deputy Premier and Minis-
ter for Transport), thereupon
formed the Queensland Labor
Party.
In the two years that have
elapsed since the Country-
Liberal Government assumed
office the beneficial effects of
its policy of decentralised de-
velopment, expansion and
encouragement of industry,
and the elevation of tourism
to a major industry, have be-
come readily and increasingly
apparent. Today over 103,000
Queenslanders are employed
in more than 5600 manufac-
turing establishments. Several
of Queensland’s factories are
exporting to the southern
States, competing with local
manufacturers on their own
ground.
Queensland ranks third in
manufacturing in Australia,
and the gross value of the
State’s output is now more
than £4OO million a year, as
against £6B million before the
war. The factory work-force
has doubled since the war.
Capital-investment has in-
creased more than sixfold
since 1938-39, in which year
it totalled £27 million. Today
the figure stands at £169
million.
Greatest Mining Era
The accession to office of
the Country-Liberal Govern-
ment has coincided with the
opening of the greatest mining
era in the history of the State.
Major developments have been
the planned expansion of Mt.
Isa Mines, whose £3-million
electrolytic copper-refinery at
Townsville is now in the first
stages of operation ; the estab-
lishment of the huge Mary
Kathleen uranium-mine, which
is now in full production ; and
the signing of a long-term
agreement between the Gov-
ernment and a big oversea
corporation for the exploita-
tion of the enormous bauxite
deposits at Weipa on the Cape
York Peninsula. Today
Queensland’s minerals earn
more than £3O million a year.
Our industrial output is
rapidly reaching the stage
where it will be complementary
in the second century of the
State’s existence with the great
primary industries.
A Well-balanced Economy
Primary industries are still,
however, the central pillar of
Queensland’s well - balanced
economy. In the past decade
an • additional 800,000 acres
have been put under crop,
raising the total cultivated area
to 2.6-million acres. Export
earnings from the sugar-
industry average £3O million
a year, about half the actual
production. More than 8000
sugarcane-farms along the
coast north of the 26th parallel
annually produce nine-million
tons of cane which are crushed
into a million tons of raw
sugar by the State’s 31 sugar-
mills. The establishment of
bulk-sugar loading-equipment
at Mackay, Lucinda and
Bundaberg has helped offset
rising costs. The turn-round
of ships loading 10,000 tons
of sugar has been reduced
from 21 days to two days.
Bulk-loading equipment will
also be installed at the sugar-
ports of Townsville, Mouril-
yan and Cairns in the near
future. More than £7 million
has already been spent in the
mechanisation of Queensland’s
sugar-ports.
An estimated 80,000 people
are employed directly or in-
directly in the sugar-industry
and more than 200,000 Aus-
tralians depend on it for their
livelihood.
Queensland’s annual wool-
clip is worth more than £SO
million.
With nearly six-million
head, Queensland has more
than half the beef-cattle in
Australia, and Queensland’s
dairy herds and butter-
factories, located along the
entire eastern coast, produced
in 1956-57 44,000 tons of
butter, 7000 tons of cheese and
50-million gallons of milk for
other purposes. An officer of
the Queensland Department of
Agriculture and Stock has been
sent overseas at the request of
the dairying industry to study
the latest developments in the
manufacture of non-cheddar
cheeses, for which an increased
demand has been created in
Queensland by the migrant
population.
Faith in Our Destiny
There has been a material
expansion of hospitals, health
and medical and education
services. Construction of new
schools and new hospitals is
being pushed ahead. Electric
power is being increasingly
harnessed to the needs of
industry and the household
consumer, even in the most
remote areas of the State. In
the post-war years more than
£lls million has been spent on
electrical development. Pro-
gressive policies of land-settle-
ment and water-conservation
have been put into effect.
The people of Queensland,
now almost a million-and-a-
half in number, enter their
second century full of faith in
the great destiny of their State.
No other State of the Com-
monwealth is so well equipped
with natural resources. All
that is needed to harness
Queensland’s vast economic
potential is finance, plus
population, and I am convinced
that in the coming days those
needs will be abundantly ful-
filled.


FIRST BOAT TO ROCKHAMPTON
The Restless Urge
owsEmm s>&@saOT
By R. S. PORTEOUS
Young Colin Archer was
annoyed, and his annoy-
ance showed in the way
he paced fore and aft
along the deck of the small
ketch Ellida, pausing now and
again to stare up the rough
track that wound its sinuous
way along the river bank.
Delays ! Nothing but
delays ! Everything and every-
one conspiring to hold-up his
sailing! First the difficulty of
procuring the right materials,
the long-drawn-out business of
extensive alterations to the
ketch, the delays in the arrival
of the stores, and the almost
insurmountable difficulty of
finding a man willing to sail
with him into the unknown.
And then, having found a man
and impressed on him the
necessity of sailing at dawn
with the first of the ebb, the
wretched man had failed to
turn up.
The sun rose above the tree-
tops and Colin Archer said
“Damn Kelly!” He glanced
at the strongly running ebb-
tide. “If he doesn’t show-up
within ten minutes I’ll sail
alone.”
Alone into the unknown!
Even as he said it he was
aware that only a hot-headed,
reckless and desperate man
would carry-out such a threat,
And he was none of those
things. It was even foreign to
his reserved Scots nature to
show impatience or annoyance,
“He’s too quiet,” his friends
said of this tall, handsome,
bearded young man. Too
quiet and for t is
rough new country,
To a lesser degree the same
had been said of his brothers
when they first arrived in the
colony. This, the earlier
colonists maintained, was a
raw, ruthless country, inhabited
by treacherous savages, and
only by_ sheer ruthlessness
could a man hope to tame
either the country or the
blacks.
Yet the Archer brothers,
pushing north from Sydney
with their sheep, their cattle
bullock-drawn drays, had
been the first settlers to take-
«P on the Burnett, mak-
in § 11 . most northerly
settlement in the colony,
Moreover they had explored
the country far to the north-
ward of their Burnett holdings,
anc j never once had they
clashed with the blacks.
Shortly after midday
Patrick Kelly stumbled
aboard. He tripped over the
Ellida’s low gunwale, collapsed
on the deck, and decided it
was as good a place as any
to spend the rest of the day.
His face was cut and bruised,
dried blood stained his torn
shirt, yet he was cheerfully
unrepentant.
A few friends in the town-
ship of Maryborough had
given him a send-off, he ex-
plained. A grand bunch of
lads they were, generous with
the rum and truly sorrowful
for a man destined soon to be
shipwrecked on unexplored
shores and eaten by cannibals.
There had been a fight, but
he couldn’t remember who
started it or what it was all
about.
“No matter,” he declared in
his rich Irish brogue. “’Twas
a foine foight even if the
rights and wrongs of it do
escape me for the minit.” A
snore followed his last words.
Colin Archer let him sleep.
They had missed the tide and
another precious day was lost;
but to make sure there would
be no more farewell parties
for his crew he cast off, let
the Ellida drift out into the
stream, and dropped the
anchor.
They would sail at dawn.
Patrick Kelly would be sick,
sore and sorry for himself, but
he could be relied on to carry
out his duties as cheerfully as
his aching head would permit.
Looking down at the bat-
tered, wrinkled face of the
sleeper, Colin smiled ruefully.
Already he had grown fond
of this wiry little Irish rascal
who had come to him a week
ago and expressed his willing-
ness to sail “anywhere there
was water enough to float a
ship.” He described himself
as a general handyman. Dur-
ing his 10 years in the colony,
he said, he had been seaman,
shepherd, bush-carpenter and
shearer, some restless urge
always driving him on.
A kindred spirit, Colin felt.
The restless urge was strong
in all the Archers. His own
parents had moved from Scot-
land to Norway. One after
another his brothers had come
to Australia, pushing always
beyond the limits of civilisa-
tion. Not content with being
the first to settle on the
Burnett, they had set out on
a fresh expedition, discovering
beyond the Tropic of Capri-
corn a lovely fertile valley
through which a mighty river
wound its way. They named
the river “Fitzroy” in honor
of the Governor of New South
Wales, claimed 450 square-
miles of the valley for their
new run, and chose a home-
stead site on the bank of a
beautiful lake.
From a mountain-top they
had traced the winding course
of the river until it emptied
into a large bay. This, Charles
Archer concluded, must be the
Keppel Bay sighted and named
by Captain Cook more than
80 years previously, although
Cook had made no mention
of a river. With a pocket-
sextant and using for an arti-
ficial horizon a pint-pot three-
quarters full of water with a


layer of oil floating on top,
Charles and Colin had made
the latitude of the new home-
stead site 23 degrees, 20mins.
south ; near enough to Cook’s
latitude of Keppel Bay.
During the long ride back
to their Burnett property they
discussed plans for stocking
the new run. Charles, they
decided, would take charge of
the overland party of bullock-
drivers, artisans and shep-
herds driving the sheep and
cattle, while Colin rode down
to Maryborough in search of
a vessel capable of carrying the
heavier stores. His boating
experiences as a boy in Nor-
way made him the logical
choice for the sea voyage.
The fact that he would be
sailing without charts for a
hitherto unknown river did not
deter him in the least. During
his few years in Australia he
had come to accept pioneer-
ing as part of this new life.
Charles, the elder brother, had
decided in his quietly assured
way that the two expeditions
would meet at the head of the
navigable waters of the new
river. The year was 1855 and
a tentative date for the meet-
ing had been set for August 16.
The 16th of August! Colin
thought ruefully. Today was
the 27th, and he was still
lying at anchor in the Mary
River, a good 40 miles from
the open sea.
At 5.30 on the morning of
the 28th they hove-up and
proceeded. In Kelly’s opinion
it was a grand start. A sou’-
easterly breeze was blowing
from abaft the beam and the
Ellida was slipping along in
fine style. Colin, the cautious
young Scot, was not so opti-
mistic, being well aware that
in some bends of the river the
breeze would be right in their
teeth. Still, the ebb-tide would
be helping them.
Kelly’s spirits rose to great
heights and descended to great
depths. With tide and wind
in their favor and a clear
stretch of open water ahead
he was the eloquent optimist,
but with the wind against them
and shoals looming ahead he
became the gloomy pessimist,
certain that they would soon
be hopelessly stranded.
Colin shared neither of his
moods. He accepted the good
and the bad as parts of a
normal course. Eventually one
would balance the other.
When they cleared the river-
mouth and swung northward
up the five-mile-wide strait
between the mainland and
Great Sandy Island, Kelly
came aft and sighed with relief.
“A foine stretch of open
water at last! ” he exulted.
“And the breeze dead astern
of us and all. I’ll relieve ye
at the tiller for a while, Cap’n.”
“We’re not out of the shoals
yet,” Colin told him. “You’d
better stay up for’ard on look-
out. .They tell me the sand-
banks extend far out into the
bay.”
After two hours of twisting
and turning and repeated
warnings of shoals ahead Kelly
disgustedly admitted that his
foine stretch of open water was
no better than a maze of mud-
banks and islets.
The open waters of Hervey
Bay were in sight when the
Ellida struck. Kelly’s warn-
ing shout came too late, and
although Colin immediately
put the tiller hard-over the
little ketch’s bows drove high
up on to the shallow sandbar.
Kelly saved himself from
being thrown overboard by
clutching frantically at the
forestay. When he recovered
his balance and looked aft he
saw that the Ellida was listing
to starboard and was so far
down by the stern that the
water was lapping over her low
gunwale.
“Holy Mother!” he moaned.
“We’re wrecked! The ship’s
sinkin’ under us, and me not
able to swim one bloody
stroke! ”
Very mildly Colin said “Will
you stop your havering, Kelly,
and help me get the sails
down? We’re in no danger
of sinking.”
Never one to waste words,
he was more concerned about
taking the forward drive out
of the sails than explaining to
Kelly that only the lifted bows
made the Ellida appear to be
sinking by the stern. The
steep shelf of sand under her
forefoot was too soft to have
caused her any structural
harm, and with the tide now
flooding she would soon float
off and drift back into deep
water.
TIfiTHiN an hour they were
under-way again and by
four that afternoon they were
clear of the last of the shoals.
Had he not been concerned
over their long-delayed start
Colin would have sought an
anchorage for the night, but
now the thought of his brother
Charles anxiously awaiting his
arrival outweighed -his usual
Scots prudence. * The wind was
fair ; there would be a moon
to help him ; he would keep
on. Handing the tiller over
to Kelly with instructions to
steer to seaward of a distant
cape and call him at sundown,
he stretched out on the deck.
Before darkness overtook
them he was back at the tiller,
revived and ready for his all-
night watch.
The sou-easter increased in
strength and as they drew clear
of the long protecting arm of
Great Sandy Island the' seas
grew bigger and more threat-
ening, looming-up astern with
great dark walls topped with
gleaming phosphorescence.
Again and again they broke
noisily under the counter, but
always the little Ellida lifted
buoyantly to their seething
brilliance, driving forward-as
though filled with sheer joy
of the contest.
No ship handles easily when
running before wind and sea,
but the Ellida demanded the
barest minimum from her
new owner. He had named
her after the magic ship in
“Frithiof Saga” and she was
living-up to her name. Long
before midnight Colin was in
love with her. Heavily laden,
overdriven, she responded to
his lightest touch. He should
have been tired, the night
should have been dragging
wearily ; instead he was hap-
pily alert and the hours were
slipping by like the gleaming
wave-tops. At times driving
clouds obscured the moon, but
in the main the visibility
remained good. Away off to
port the low hills of the main-
land were always in sight and
ahead no danger broke the run
of the seas.
At dawn Colin reached out
and shook Kelly awake.
Wrapped up in a spare sail,
the little Irishman had slept
soundly throught the night,
undisturbed by the wallowing
motion or the occasional spray
that drifted inboard to spatter
noisily against his covering.
Now, roused from deep sleep,
he sat up, rubbed his eyes and
stared around him. _
Ahead, under the belly of
the mainsail, he could see a
bold, rocky cape and far
beyond that the faint grey
loom of another one. Astern,
his fascinated gaze was held by
the onrushing waves, leaden
now, in the cold dawn-light.
He showed none of the panic
he had displayed at yesterday’s
stranding. Instead he gleefully
expressed the opinion that the
Ellida was “roarin’ along wid
the speed of a stagecoach
boltin’ downhill.”
Colin smiled at his enthusi-
asm. Without log or charts
he could only guess at their
speed, but he knew he wouldn’t
he far out in assessing it at
between seven and eight knots.
“If you take the tiller I’ll get
some breakfast,” he said to
Kelly.
Breakfast consisted of salt-
beef and damper washed down
with cold water. There were
no cooking facilities on board,
but both men accepted the
rough, cold fare as normal.
Each would have liked a mug
of hot tea and each looked
on it as a luxury that would
taste all the better at the end
of the voyage.
Their hunger satisfied, Colin
said “I’ll lie down for a
while. Keep her on this course
until you pass the big head-
land and then steer to pass two
or three miles outside the next
one. Call me if you see any-
thing that looks like breakers
or shoals ahead.”
He was weary from his long
night at the tiller, he realised,
as he stretched out and pulled
the sail over him, too tired
to bother about changing his
wet clothes. In five minutes
he was asleep. He was dream-
ing of one of his boyhood
cruises on the Norwegian
coast when he heard Kelly’s
frantic yell.
“Cap’n! Wake up for the
love of Hivin! There’s rocks
ahead! Rocks all around us! ”
T ater Colin wondered how
' he had struggled free of
the sodden sail, recognised the
most urgent danger and jerked
the tiller away from Kelly
before the badly-scared little
Irishman had finished yelling.
“Haul in the main-sheet,”
he roared, putting the tiller
hard-over and pushing Kelly
forward at the same time.
Dead ahead, only a few
ship’s-lengths from the Ellida’s
bowsprit, the breakers were
bursting in clouds of spray
that fountained high above the
masthead, and beneath the
spray the suck-back of the
waves revealed the ugly black
of a rocky outcrop.
“The jib now!” Colin
shouted as the Ellida’s nose
swung seaward. He had the
tiller between his knees and
was hauling-in the mizzen-
sheet. “Flatten it well home.”
Kelly made the main-sheet
fast and sprang forward in
obedience. With someone to
give the orders he was a cap-
able enough seaman. He saw
the weed-strewn rocks slipping
past to port as the Ellida, close-
hauled now, heeler-over and
drove gamely seaward. She
would win clear of them by
a small margin, but she was
still far from safe.
Ahead, less than a mile dis-
tant, the seething white of

THE PIEBALD’S BELL
By ION L. IDRSESS
Hargreaves cursed the
truant horse as he
strode back along the
dew-marked tracks.
Dawn splashed a granite
peak with crimson bars. The
Rocky Range was still a wall
of gloom. A colony of starlings
had awakened and proceeded
to arouse the whole bush side.
Damp grass surrendered its
scent to the air.
Hargreaves was relieved that
the rogue’s tracks proved him
still hobbled. Otherwise he’d
not stop until he had reached
his birthplace, the Coen, eighty
miles south. This daily track-
ing was irksome.
Presently the distant bell
clanged jerkily. The piebald
was plunging southwards in
between bites. Five miles from
camp the horse stood quietly,
gazing over its shoulder with a
look that spoke of resignation
for the time being.
Before saddling - up, Har-
greaves walked along the deep
gully beside which he had
camped. He fancied that gully.
Its bedrock was of blue slate,
crossed by bars ; the wash of
ironstone boulders and quartz
and a hint of porphyry. It was
dry except for the rock-hole
which had given him water.
With a light prospecting pick
he chipped at a pebble-filled
crevice running across a bar.
He’d trv a prospect, anyway.
Handfuls of the gravel he threw
in the dish, scraping deep into
the crack with the long pick-
point. Presently his eyes dilated
and his mouth opened. He
drew a long breath, peering
into the crack which held
wedged a glistening yellow
speck. No need to wash a dish.
The gully carried coarse gold!
TTe hurried along the gully,
chuckling aloud. He was
quite alone and had found gold,
virgin gold. Heavy payable
gold. The joy of discovery
must be worked-off first.
Back at the crevice he
scraped it out with shaky hands,
placing each grain of sand
carefully in the dish. Experi-
ence whispered that the crevice
was a “natural catch.” The dish
would glisten yellow when he’d
panned it off. Carefully he
swirled the dish, and the water
licked the gravel away in
layers. Soon his waiting ear
caught the scratch of some-
thing solid rolling on the dish
bottom. He chuckled at the
diminishing sand. The yellow
pellets began peeping up. And
the gully was his very own.
Hargreaves put the dish aside
and laughed quietly into his
hands, then lit the pipe, and,
clambering the steep bank,
strolled into the bush—just
thinking. For two miles his un-
leashed brain ran riot in gold!
He stumbled upon a wide creek
with still water. Not the grace-
ful beauty of hanging vines,
of creeper-trailed palms and
drooping orchid, but the prac-
tical use of the water brought
him to his senses.
The very thing! Water to
@SBKHSSB&I3Sr !?&©l&kW-1926
wash the dirt. It could be
horsepacked here and put
through. The “boys” and their
horses could camp here.
Abruptly he turned, intent on
pegging a reward claim and
hurrying back to the Coen to
report.
At the gully he hesitated. His
six horses were quietly grazing:
the packs lay in the grass just
as he’d unsaddled the night
before. To make certain, he’d
try a few dishes all along the
gully, then start for the Coen
first thing tomorrow morning.
~VTo sense in starting a local
' rush if the gully were not
rich enough to justify it. That
evening, when too dark to see
the gold in the pannings, he
boiled the billy, ravenously
hungry, but not the least bit
tired. The day had been far
too short. After tea he smoked,
staring straight into the fire,
thinking clearly at last. He had
proved the gully gold-bearing
for a mile. The head was by
far the richest, just where two
ravines junctioned. Each
carried gold and the rains of
centuries had concentrated
both deposits at the junction.
Roughly he estimated £6OOO of
gold there alone. About ten
men’s ground. The prospector
was entitled to five men’s
ground. Ten men’s ground!
Five men’s ground! That
meant halving the gold. His
share would be half! Above
and below the gully was pay-
able, but not nearly so rich as
at the junction.
Hargreaves’s pipe cooled out.
An owl hooted from the
precipitous darkness astride the
coastal range. A mate answered,
melodiously, from distance.
The stars glinted as a thousand
specks of gold. The piebald’s
bell, night-softened, foretold
that he was yet again starting
for the Coen. Hargreaves
stared at the dulling fire.
For three weeks following
Hargreaves worked at stoning
the gully, breaking rock-bars,
clearing fallen timber, loosen-
ing the gravel bed. Another
month and the wet season
would flood the gully with
running water. Then the rush-
ing waters would carry away
the gully gravel, leaving
behind the heavier gold. He
would clean-up a little fortune.
Himself! Then report to the
Coen. They could have all the
rest of the gully.
One wet season would sluice
away ground that otherwise
would mean twelve solid
months’ toil with pick and
shovel. And he’d clean up
£6OOO, not £3OOO. He carried
ample tucker. He had the
bush to himself.
He worked from streak of
dawn to gloom of night.
/'Ane dawn, Hargreaves was
returning with the persever-
ing piebald. He secretly enjoyed
each morning trip now. It
gave him something to growl
at. The days were far too
busy, the nights too full of
golden dreams to leave any
room for grousing. Except for
the piebald, the unaccustomed
luxury would have been denied
him. And then he heard pick-
blows! Muffled, but distinct,
regular and systematic from
the hidden depths of the gully.
He dropped the piebald’s
halter and stood very still,
quick-eyed, something clutch-
ing his heart.
The Coen boys had tracked
him! They’d rushed the gully!
He peered down the steep
banks at the junction, and
sighed with thankfulness on
seeing thfe ground within his
own pegs lay untouched. Walk-
ing above the bank anger
gripped him, for around the
first bend worked a line of men,
their backs bent, shovel-blades
flashing in the sun. Around the
following bends still, he heard
the thud of picks. Chinamen!
“Get to hell out of this, you
yellow swine! ” Hargreaves
roared along the bank, shaking
fists at the men, who, without
straightening their backs, gazed
up impassively.
“What! You won’t go? By
hell!” He jumped down the
bank, his foot turned on a
loose stone and bounced him
in a heap to the bottom.
Madly, he rushed the two
nearest Chinamen, who im-
mediately loped up the gully,
gathering their comrades as
they ran. They flew around the
first bend and Hargreaves
turned panting on the men who
still watched from behind.
They fled, pursued by the
white man’s flaming words of
wrath. He turned once again,
his boots crunching heavily in
the loosened gravel. The pick-
thuds still vibrated without a
pause. Around the bend and
the shovelmen scattered before
him, this time scaling the gully
walls. Hargreaves ignored
them, and with clenched hands
advanced on the pick-swingers.
One by one they dropped their
tools and walked before him.
He snatched a pick and rushed.
They ran, their bare feet
pattering upon the loose gully
stones. With wind fast failing
he chased them around the
further bend. Here worked
another line of patient shovel-
men. The pickmen clambered
the gully-sides and disappeared.
The shovelmen, one by one,
dropped their tools and walked,
then ran, before him. He
chased them until they, too,
clambered the steep sides and
the gully stretched empty before
him. Drawing the painful
breath of exhaust : on he climbed
the bank. He was near done.
He’d have a billy of tea before
commencing work. He’d
cleaned them all up, anyway.
Chows! Chows rushing a
new gold-find! Against the
mining laws and against all
white men’s laws. How had
they found him? He’d thought
he was all alone in the great
Peninsula bush.
"D aking the fire together he
paused, listening like an
animal who has baffled the
hounds only to hear their bay-
ing again. From the gully
floated the dull, methodical
blow of picks, the muffled scrap-
ing of shovels thrust through
sand. Clenching a blazing fire-
stick, he rushed down amongst
the Chinamen. They scattered
and hopped up both banks like
monkeys, to impassively watch
the white man race down the
gully. As he disappeared

around the nearest bend, they
quietly dropped back.
A mile down the gully Har-
greaves gasped against a slate
bar. He’d cleaned them up
again! This was the limit of
the gold run and there would
be none of the yellow rats
down further. With head lean-
ing gratefully against the cool
stone, he strove to ease th&
fury within him. Curse it, his
beating heart was mocking him
as with the distant thump of
pick-blows.
With the easing of his
breathing his ears tingled. It
was pick-blows. From away
up the gully came softly, “thud-
thump, thud-thump.”
Hargreaves walked back,
something very like a sob at
his throat.
The Chinamen this time
scrambled partly up the banks,
waited until he passed, then
slipped to work again. Ho
walked to the very gully-head
then, laughing queerly at the
work-sounds breaking out
behind him, climbed the bank
and reached camp. Grasping
a cartridge-belt he returned. At
the nearest man below he
levelled the rifle and shouted
“Go quick! I shoot!”
All within the bend ceased
working, looked up, then
quickly bent to work. Har-
greaves finger eased on the
trigger, a curiously baffled
feeling choking his rage. Along
his rifle-sights the yellow digger
swung his pick slowly. Har-
greaves just simply couldn’t
be a murderer. Almost whim-
pering he fired at a rock beside
the toiling figure. The bullet
flattened and its ricochetting
fragments shrieked along the
gully. Rapidly he fired and
the tortured lead whizzed in
the enclosed space. The China-
men dropped tools and fled.
Smiling happily, the white man
followed along the bank, firing
into the gully where between
bends toiled figures. Once
again he cleaned the gully up
and laughed triumphantly as
he gazed down at the rock
on which he had leaned ex-
hausted not an hour before.
From away up the gully
came the sound of picks at
work. Hargreaves toyed aim-
lessly with the trigger. He was
beaten.
TTe sat overlooking his own
claim, wishing for any
Chinaman to put a pick within
his ground. He knew he could
shoot a man for jumping—it
was the unwritten law of gold.
But the 80 yellow diggers never
in any way interfered with the
marked-off ground. It was
ready loosened and stoned now,
waiting only for the thunder-
storms to sweep the debris
away.
The Chinamen waited for no
storms. Discovery for them
meant finis. Forty men picked,
then shovelled off the loose
wash; the remainder scraped
the rockbottom as clean as a
housewife sweeps the floor,
and in baskets carried the dirt
to Hargreaves’s creek. He
glanced towards the winding
pad already worn by the loping
feet. With tireless energy they
were working up@ the gully;
and when the wet did come,
with the running water’s aid
they would sweep the bedrock
as clean as a new pin and dis-
appear as silently as they had

come. And the whites at the
Coen would miss a good gully!
Hargreaves didn’t dare ride
and warn them. He guessed
what would happen to his own
rich ground with 80 men work-
ing it day and night. He was
helpless. The gold held him
so.
the distant clang of the
bell of the piebald sneak-
ing Coen-wards as usual. Har-
greaves stiffened. A smile
stole across his face. He strode
to the camp, discarded the rifle,
and, snatching a halter, set out.
He crossed a ravine running
into the big creek and halted,
for the bank was undermined.
Close by was an abandoned
camp littered with empty
ginger-jars.
He understood then. A
couple of Chinese fossickers
had been trying the ravine
when he had found the gully.
They had simply spied, then
hurried away back to the
Palmer. Their friends had
gathered like hawks to the
feast. Even through his anger
Hargreaves, admired that swift
bush trek with heavy baskets
of rice.
He caught the piebald and,
hurrying back, picked up his
own riding-horse. He’d chase
the piebald a good rousing
start-off, anyway. Hitching
both horses to a tree he slipped
off the piebald’s bell and dis
appeared within the tent,
where he wrote a note stating
all that was occurring at the
gully. Wrapping the note in
canvas he lashed it to the
tongue of the bell. It was
protected as within a metal
case. Grinning hugely, he re-
strapped the bell around the
piebald’s neck.
The horse 1 would make
straight for the Coen, be at
once recognised, the dumb bell
noticed and examined. He
slipped the halter off the pie-
bald and saddled his own horse.
His foot slipped in the stirrup-
iron as sinewy yellow hands
grasped the bridle rein.
Amazed, Hargreaves started at
the score of men who had
stepped from nowhere. One
tripped inside the tent and
slipped away with the rifle.
Hargreaves sprang for the
saddle, but was jerked sprawl-
ing, the frightened horse being
pulled aside and unsaddled.
He roared mockingly as the
scared piebald lit-out with
tail mast-high, the freed saddle-
horse galloping at his heels.
Hargreaves punched and kicked
and bit and scratched. Ten
men rolled atop of him. He
was pommelled until his ex-
hausted body felt a pulp.
Through all his berserk rage he
dumbly wondered that he
could not struggle up. Some-
how he had never realised that
Chinamen possess pugnacious
strength the same as other men.
They left him there. Evi-
dently they were determined to
work the gully out without
interference. He shaded his
eyes from the sun and laughed.
A week later, Hargreaves
from the gully bank watched
the blue ribbon of smoke that
rose straight up from his
galley fire. On a razorback
spur, clearly silhouetted, sat i
statuesque horseman. Har-
greaves hurried to the fire and
stirred denser the column of
smoke. Along the spur, at a
canter, wound an increasing
file of horsemen.
As if holding the joke of a
century, Hargreaves walked to
the gully-bank and laughed
down at the sweating men
below.


STEPHENS v. STEPHENS
James Brunton Stephens
was born sixty-five years
ago; you may forage
ancient Bo’ness from the
map. In the country of Avon
and Ayr, heedless that Heaven
had marked him for poet, he
swallowed his porridge, swal-
lowed his books, and demanded
(a Scottish young Oliver)
“Mair!” so persistently that
they sent him to Edinburgh
University—whence he appar-
ently brought no degree. Next
we hear of him settled as
school-teacher near Glasgow—
afterwards travelling Southern
Europe, Egypt, and Palestine,
as tutor to “a young gentleman
of fortune” —until he reached
Queensland in ’66, in his thirty-
second year, and continued his
tutorial profession on a Logan
River station, near Brisbane.
Some ten years thereafter he
was serving Q. Education
Dept., in charge of the tiny
school at Ashgrove, a Brisbane
suburb where the curious
pilgrim is still told that
“Brunton Stephens wrote
poetry HERE! ” Later they
transferred him to a clerkship
in Q. Col. Secretary’s office ;
and today he is chief clerk to
the Chief Secretary, busily
refining the English of the
Govt, dispatches. And he is,
wrote the late T. J. Byrnes,
Premier of Queensland, “the
Father and chief Master in all
the arts of Australasian song.”
* * * *
If “One Above” pre-
destined Brunton Stephens to
be Poet, it is surely malign
Providence who made him
Pedagogue during twenty years
of youthful prime. For twenty
years “that ’ere Providence had
it all his own way” ; and he
fettered Pedagogue Stephens
with chains which “One
Above” has never enabled
Poet Stephens to break. So,
under the dual influence, see
poor Pegasus with ink-pot feet
and a tail of tawse, trotting
nimbly round the schoolroom!
bestridden by a dominie who
snatches his language from the
dictionary, his tropes from the
text-books, and his emotions
through the school-room
windows as he turns fond
passing eyes to the fair cham-
paign which under happier
auspices might have been his
hunting-ground. Now and
again “One Above” permits ten
minutes’ intermission ; “but
you mustn’t go away from
the school,” says Providence.
So Pegasus drinks sadly from
the Pierian spring of the play-
ground tap, while his master
chases the comic Muse around
the globes and has an assigna-
tion with the tragic Muse
behind the blackboard. By-
and-by we have “Convict
Once,” “The Godolphin
Arabia n,” “Miscellaneous
Poems,” etc., written by Poet
Stephens in concert with
Pedagogue Stephens ; and with
the tail of an eye “that ’ere
Providence” may be seen wink-
ing triumphantly at “One
Above.”
* * * *
“Convict Once” was pub-
lished in London, 1871. It has
been criticised by T. J. Byrnes,
M.A. of Melb. University and
sometime Q. Premier, in a
lengthy paper read to Brisb.
Literary Circle in 1894; by
Henry Gyles Turner and
Alexander Sutherland in “The
Here —condensed from two
Red Page articles in 1901—
is A. G. Stephens (of Too-
woomba) criticising Brunton
Stephens (of Brisbane).
Development of Australian
Literature,” 1898 ; and by
David Christie Murray in one
of a series of articles written
for the local press when he
visited Australia. Thus we
have what may be considered
fair types of Queensland
opinion, other Australian
opinion, and foreign opinion,
regarding Brunton Stephens’s
most pretentious piece of
verse. T. J. Byrnes declared
“he has produced nothing to
equal it since, for grandeur or
beauty or dramatic continuity.”
. . . “In ‘Convict Once’ the
poet has handled the hexa-
meter metre in a manner that
is unequalled in English litera-
ture.” . . . “ ‘Convict Once’ is
a great poem, and worthy of
being composed by any of our
Victorian poets.” Turner and
Sutherland declare that “ ‘Con-
vict Once’ is the most highly
finished piece of work that has
been accomplished in Aus-
tralia” . . . “in a hundred pages
there is scarcely a line that
could be improved.” Christie
Murray quoted the lines
Down in the vines he is sitting,
the fruitage, leaf shadowed
above him,
Lending concomitant charm to the
ripeness that flushes his cheek,
and wondered what the deuce
concomitant was doing in that
galley. (Pedagogue Stephens
could have told him ; he put
it there.)
Alone among these com-
mentators, Christie Murray has
touched the spot—and the blot.
Byrnes, M.A. of Melb. Uni-
versity, is ridiculous; and
Turner and Sutherland are
ignorant. “Convict Once” is
an interesting, and, from the
local viewpoint, a considerable
performance in verse ; but it is
not “a great poem,” it is not
“worthy of being composed” by
Tennyson (for the art of it),
or by Matthew Arnold (for the
thought of or by Browning
(for the passion of it); and it
is so far from being “the most
highly-finished piece of work
that has been accomplished in
Australia” that one could more
correctly say “in a hundred
pages there is scarcely a line
that could not be improved.”
Even if the story were well-
conceived, the continual in-
trusion of Stephens to speak a
piece in the names of the
characters would spoil it. And
it is not well-conceived. Mag-
dalen Power is a convict; but
whether transported to Aus-
tralia or imprisoned in Aus-
tralia does not appear.
The more reasonable sup-
position is that she was
transported though perhaps
she was imprisoned in Eng-
land and came to Australia
afterwards. Anyhow, she has
been in “fair Italy” (p. 66), and
ascended Vesuvius; and she
must have been uncommonly
educated, either in gaol or
before gaol, for she flings poly-
syllables in the air and catches
them in her diary-poem with
the ease of a juggler. She is
accepted as governess for a
squatter’s three daughters
Hyacinth, Lily and Violet. Lily
and Violet are ciphers, who
are “otherwhile mounted on
steeds and in madness of
motion careering”—as Mag-
dalen Stephens grandiloquently
puts it in her diary-poem.
Hyacinth falls in love with
Raymond Trevelyan, the son
of a neighboring squatter who
is a convict —like Magdalen.
Arises the old squatter un-
expectedly, hot with feud
against Raymond’s father the
convict, and says he will never
let Hyacinth marry Raymond
until he himself offers to marry
a convict. Now we see the
other reason (besides the
bottled death-reflections) why
the old mother had to die so
casually a few pages back. For
this Very Remarkable Old
Squatter suddenly proposes
marriage to the governess who
has tricked the family, in order
that she may be a mother (!)
to Hyacinth (! !) and the
others.
Anyway, Magdalen points out
to him that, she being a con-
vict, he can keep his oath and
still permit Hyacinth to marry
Raymond, the convict's son—
which Hyacinth does. Then
Magdalen, having made amends
to Hyacinth, dies at once
(p. 114) —it might be the day
after Hyacinth’s wedding-day
—and the Remarkable Old
Squatter, if he wants a mother
for Lily and Violet, has simply
got to go to Brisbane and be
d d to it, shearing or no
shearing. And that is the
farrago of “Convict Once.”
* * * *
I feel rather like Cain after
the little transaction with Abel;
but, in view of the utterances
of Byrnes, Turner, Sutherland
and many others, this side of
“Convict Once” has long
needed exposure. Of the other
side, and of the other poems
of Brunton Stephens, there is
something to be said on
another occasion.
£ * * *
Brunton Stephens’s qualifica-
tions for poetry are energy, a
little fancy, a little power of
thought not very new or
original—the qualifications of
his Scottish nation. He lacks
imagination and strength of
emotion —Poetry’s most essen-
tial requisites ; he lacks, tech-
nically, the finer qualities of
Taste ; and the Poet in him is
hampered by the continual
obtrusion of the Pedagogue.
Considered on the intellec-
tual basis, as clever verse, his
work stands high. His verbal
quips are as good as Hood’s ;
his verbal ingenuity as great as
Calverley’s, though his rhythms
are less fluid, less flawless than
Calverley’s. The punster’s
hand is seen even in “Convict
Once,” when he says of Death
(p. 103)
’Tis but the clasp of the die on
the coin, which the mould must
once cover,
Ere it shine forth with the bright
superscription and image of
God.
In “New Chum and Old
Monarch” the pun is more fitly
placed—
“ Enter, sire; no longer linger;
Cease thy signals grandly dumb:
Point not thus with royal finger
To thy hungry vacuum.
“Though thy pangs are multifarious,
Soon they all shall pass away;
Come, my begging Belisarius —
Belisorius, I should say.”
Superb ; and Brunton Stephens
can repeat these triumphs to
our head’s delight. Here is the
predominant Pedagogue at
home, scintillating and
splendid. A collection of
Brunton Stephens’s witty verses
would well deserve perpetuity;
and it is by. these successes, and
not by his serious, emotional
failures, that he will gain what-
ever perpetuity is allotted to
him.

Northern Notes
The Brisbane Cup's centenary
is due only about half-a-dozen
years after Queensland’s own.
They lined-up for the first one
in 1866, about five years after
the first Melbourne Cup. First
Brisbane Cup winner was
Forester, carrying 9.11 over
the then 2\ miles. Going
backwards from recent ones,
other notable winners have in-
cluded Redcraze, Hydrogen,
Prince o’ Fairies, Tragopan,
Spear Chief (2), Lough Neagh,
Rivalli, St. Valorey (2), Te
Kara, Cagou and Battalion
(who in 1897 scored with 10.3).
Queensland’s Lough Neagh
was one of Australia’s great
all-rounders of 20-odd years
back. Winner of the Brisbane
Cup in 1936 with 9.3, he was a
son of Bachelor’s Persse and
was good in all types of races
over all sorts of distances.
Another of the great Queens-
land all-rounders, Bernborough,
at one stage won 15 in a row,
and in all earned £25,504 from
26 firsts, three seconds and two
thirds. In 1946 he won both
the Doomben Ten Thousand
and Doomben Cup, with 10.5
and 10.11. Incidentally, the
B.A.T.C. first staged its
Doomben double in 1933. The
first Q.T.C. Stradbroke was run
in 1890, first St. Leger in
1881, first Queensland Cup in
1878 and first Derby in 1868.
Reigning northern champion
Earlwood has been exception-
ally notable as a three-year-
old. This year’s Doomben Cup
added £7OOO to his stake-earn-
ings, now nearing £19,000 for
11 firsts (from 25 starts) and
minor placings. In the season
just over he also won the
Queensland Guineas and the
Derby, and the B.A.T.C.’s
Summer Cup. Earlwood be-
longs to a family which pro-
duced Buzalong (Caulfield
Cup), Ardglen (Q.T.C. Derby
and St. Leger), Whittier (V.R.C.
Derby and Caulfield Cup), and
Accarak (Australian Cup). Yet
the highest bid for him as a
yearling was 150gns., and that
wasn't much below the reserve
on him —a very lucky day for
his breeder-owner.

Some of the best riders on
Australian courses in recent
years learnt their craft in
Queensland, among them that
most outstanding trio Neville
Sellwood, George Moore and
Noel McGrowdie. Sellwood,
who has won the Sydney
jockeys’ premiership several
times and was lately only just
pipped for yet another, has
started off in a way that sug-
gests he will win again this
season. He landed his 1000th
winner three years back. Each
of the trio, Sellwood, Moore
and McGrowdie, served his
apprenticeship with Brisbane
trainer Jim Shean, though
Moore was first attached to the
stables of Louie Dahl. Mc-
Growdie has, of course, won
most of the Cups that are run
in Australia. There have
been many other goods ones,
too, including Fred Shean,
who in 1938 strung-up an
extraordinary winning se-
quence : Tatter sail’s Cup on
Billy Boy, the A.J.C. Gimcrack
Stakes on Merry Smile, the
Epsom Handicap on King’s

Sydney Form
Excuses were made for the
defeat of odds-on favorite
Travel Boy in the Hobartville
Stakes at Warwick Farm last
Saturday, but Martello Towers
beat him easily, and at no
stage did Travel Boy look like
beating that grey. However,
Travel Boy looked slightly
underdone, despite his fast
gallops of the early morn-
ings. Many disregard the
Hobartville as a Derby pointer
and wait for the Rosehill
Guineas (next month). Mar-
tello Towers may still be the
fastest three-year-old when
that is decided. His four wins
and a second from six starts
is sound form.
Sydney isn’t strong in stayers
at the moment, and this year’s
Metropolitan could easily go to
a visiting galloper. Valerius,
raced by A.J.C. chairman A. G.
Potter and Keith Mackay,
headed the betting-list after
winning the Warwick Farm
August Handicap in good style
from veteran Beaupa (who
hasn’t won a race for nearly
two years), with six-year-old
mare Tranquilette third.
Valerius carried 8.7, or 21b.
more than his Metro p.
handicap.
Mr. and Mrs. M. V. Point,
owners of Spacewise, could be
racing the best three-year-old
filly of the season. She carried
8.12 (topweight, with a 7.4
limit) and won comfortably the
Warwick Farm Novice for
fillies of her age. Rosebery
trainer Bob Stuart has her in
fine fettle. She is by Flying
Missel (Am.) from Merrie

“Post”: Consider the meet-
ing (not untypical of late years)
at Randwick on the opening-
day of the new season —three

on a seven-event programme!
Warwick Farm meetings are
usually of similar calibre.
Surely headquarters, at least,
shouldn’t repeatedly be made

moderates, to the virtual ex-
clusion of better-class horses?
Compare this with the practice
of the V.R.C. or V.A.T.C.

At Flemington
At Melbourne h.q. last
Saturday outsiders rolled-in
one after the other. Severest
blows were the defeat of the
sister-and-brother pair Broad-
lea and Lord. Gay Saba
downed Lord in the w.-f.-a.
J. J. Liston Stakes. Lord
looked well, but apparently
needed the run. Gay Saba has
been a good-class galloper
throughout his career; there’s
a Moonee Valley Stakes in his
list, and he won last year’s
Invitation Stakes. This latter
race will be Gay Saba’s target
again this year. Like the
Liston, it’s over seven furlongs,
his pet distance. Lord will be
fitter when he steps out for
the Memsie Stakes at his home-
track, Caulfield, next Saturday
week. Sir Blink’s strong finish
was encouraging to his Cup
admirers, but Chicola, who
whipped the field in, was dis-
appointing.
Broadlea was reckoned the
best of good things in the mile
Berwick Handicap for three-
year-old fillies, but she never
looked a danger. The race
went to Princess Faux, who did
her early racing in Adelaide,
and has now won twice in
Melbourne.
Longest-priced winner in the
day of long-shots was the 100-
to-1 Regal Pine, full-brother
to Red Pine, minor placegetter
in last year’s Melbourne Cup.
Regal Pine put-up a particu-
larly good performance. He
started from the extreme out-
side of the 18 runners, quickly
hit the front, and, although he
drifted out in the straight,
never looked like losing. His
Ballarat owner, W. Franklin,
reckons the Woodburn-Sweet
Folly colt is a Derby proposi-
tion, and certainly he beat a
lot of youngsters that have
been spoken of as classic hopes.
The colt will bear watching in
his next couple of runs.
As a two-year-old the Pride
of Kildare-Baldora gelding
Monasterevan showed first-
class form, but over the last
12 months he has raced poorly,
though at Caulfield a couple
of weeks back he showed a
glimpse of his old dash when
he finished a good second to
Brocken. He showed further
improvement to take the
second heat of the Members’
Highweight.

In England, flat-racing and
racing over the jumps have their
separate seasons. With our kinder
climate, a sharp division is not
necessary, but there could be a
sound case for suspending jumping-
events after the running of the
Australian Hurdle-Steeple double.
Jumping-races add a lot to a day’s
programme when the fields are
good, but they are pathetic when
poor-class jumpers are racing.

Pacing Record
Enzedder Guiseppe (from
scratch) started a red-hot
favorite at Harold Park last
Friday night, on the strength
of his close second to Flingo
the previous week, but this
time Flingo (24yds. behind)
beat him easily, running
seventh till three furlongs from
home, then overhauling him
(out in front) and sweeping
ahead at the home-turn, to win
running away. Enzedder
Dune was second, Guiseppe
fifth. Flingo’s time, 3min.
24 2/10sec. for the 13 furlongs
and 98yds., was a race record,
one second faster than the
previous best by First Kiss.
His mile-rate of 2.7} was the
fastest of the season. Flingo
qualified to start in the £SOOO
Anniversary Cup, to be run
at Harold Park on October 24.

The V.F.L. “four,” with a
round to go, is Melbourne,
Carlton, Collingwood and
Essendon —the Dons, level on
match - points with North,
nudged in ahead on percen-
tages. (Last Saturday Essen-
don beat Fitzroy 11.8-7.12 and
South shocked North 19.20-6.6.)
Melbourne is now sure of one
“double - chance” whether
beaten or not this Saturday by
South, and Carlton, which
scraped in by two points
against Hawthorn on Saturday,
is almost sure of the other.
Collingwood seems certain to
qualify, even if beaten by
Geelong, while Essendon is
more likely to make it than
North (which meets Carlton
on Saturday). If both Essen-
don and North lose and Fitz-
roy, at home, beats St. Kilda,
the Lions will roar in ahead of
them.

than 30 Australians, excluding
the official six-man team, have

that Union now challenges
Soccer as the world’s greatest
ball-game. It’s become very
popular in Central Europe.
Delegates made quiet appeals
to Australia to invite European
teams, but not to overlook
South Africa and the British
Isles. It was made clear that
South Africa and England
needed Australia, because teams
from this country play such
attractive football that earnings
from their visits far exceed
those of other touring teams.
Australian delegates were given
to understand that if South
Africa were invited to tour Aus-
tralia the Springboks Union
would probably foot the bill
for getting them here.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
U.K. ELECTION PROSPECTS
Tn view of the possibility of
•*- a U.K. general election in
the coming autumn, three
London weeklies take a look
at the relative records and posi-
tions of the two major parties:
“The Spectator”: “The
Squalid Parliament, Aneurin
Bevan has called it: and it
hardly deserves to be remem-
bered by any friendlier name.
The final spectacle of Con-
servatives recording without
dissent their repudiation of a
commission they had them-
selves set-up was only the last
of a series of episodes which
have disgraced them and their
country. Yet the Opposition
themselves must take some of
the blame. They have not suc-
ceeded in convincing the un-
committed voter that their own
hands would be much cleaner
if the accident of politics had
meant that they, rather than
the Conservatives, had been in
power when hopes of an easy
transition to a Central African
Federation —which, after all,
was their idea —disintegrated
last spring. They might not
have made the same mistakes,
but they would surely have
denied as blandly that anything
they had done was mistaken ;
party loyalty would have been
as blatantly invoked to trample
on uneasy conscience; the
three-line whip would have
been as freely used to beat-
down their opponents.
“The real responsibility for
the state of affairs, though, lies
less with either party than with
the duolithic structure of
Parliament today. The fact
that Members of both parties
have constantly to vote without
regard for conscience or for
commonsense has meant' that
they have tended to forfeit the
public’s respect ; so that when,
say, the Opposition particularly
want to be taken seriously, as
they undoubtedly did over the
African debates, the public
listens with only half an ear.
“Admittedly the reports in
the Tory press, which pretended
that the debate on the Devlin
Report W'as a debacle for
Labor, were grossly misleading;
by all reputable accounts the
Opposition put up quite a
worth-while performance, and
no doubt the Liberals would
have added their contribution
if the various occupants of the
Chair had not sedulously
ignored them. But in any case
it is very doubtful whether the
merits of the Oppositon case
were grasped by that sector of
the electorate to whom they
were most urgently addressed:
for the uncommitted voter no
longer has sufficient faith in
Labor’s present trustworthiness
—or in its future intentions —to
be attentive.”

'“The Economist” : “In Mr.
Gaitskell the Opposition has a

moments, as in his well-
put advocacy of the non-
nuclear club, when Mr. Bevan
gives again at least the hint of
a great Foreign Secretary;
but these have been dishearten-
ingly few. As for the rest of
the shadow-Cabinet there is
much good hard work, but,
away from the levers of power
and the springs of information,
little elan ; and, time and again,
the carefully mounted assaults
crumble through a disabling
want of style.
“On the Government side
the Prime Minister’s perform-
ance still veers abruptly be-
tween that of the new, calm,
self-contained commander and
that of the old insensitive
farceur, between aristocrat and
parvenu. But, thanks largely
to his special and natural skill
in the management of men,
most of them of over-average
ability, the impression that the
consistently effective Parlia-
mentary performer, but he is its
only one. Perhaps the name of
Mr. Wilson might be added, if
the memory of the Bank-rate
tribunal did not linger, if he
refreshed the serious content
of his speeches as regularly as
he renews his jokes, and if he
gained stature by committing
himself on such great subjects
as nuclear disarmament.
“But Mr. Bevan’s fangs are
drawn: flair and flare have be-
come mannerism ; a muted
didactism that too often be-
trays an Eisenhowerlike inno-
cence of published information
cannot rouse the conscience
of the country. There are
country is run by a well-oiled
machine consciously articu-
lated in Downing Street is un-
commonly bright for the fag-
end of any Administration.
“What is more, because the
Labor party has been under the
necessity of laying out all its
signals on the hillside well in
advance of the election, Mr.
Macmillan has been able to
display himself in the truest
tradition of a Tory Prime
Minister by walking off with
much of the Opposition’s
raiment. By Tory precedent
and standards, this sleight-of-
hand is in no sense cheating:
the Conservative principle in
politics is, at its best, sup-
posed to compass the anticipa-
tion by a small margin of any
popular demand for any
specific change. So, if an
Opposition, intent on proving
itself more pragmatic than
doctrinaire, itself does some
suggestive devilling, that is very
obliging of it.
“Mr. Macmillan’s skill and
the vigor of well-adjusted
subordinates, however, are not
all. There has been luck, both
with the terms of trade and
with the. election cycle itself.
Provided Mr. Macmillan could
pump back morale into the dis-
integrated team which he in-
herited, an election was not
necessary until after the inter-
val of penny-pinching was
over, and the Government
could display a new open-
handedness towards the elec-
torate. The reality of economic
advance here and now blots
out any intricate statistical
arguments about where the
responsibility may lie for the
low starting-point and the late-
ness of the starting-hour.”
* » ♦
“Time and Tide": “There
are two elements in the current
political scene. Both the major
parties are resting on a static
mass of support. The other
element is political apathy.
Both parties complain of this,
but the Tory complaint is mere
lip-service. Apathy is good for
the party in power.
“It is good in this instance
because it is merely another
name for what is probably the
most significant political trans-
formation of the period. It
marks the transition from the
fevered post-war days to the
first approximation to a
genuine peace-time atmosphere
we have had for nearly a
quarter of a century. The elec-
torate finds living pleasant and
stable enough to have a vested
interest in the status quo. The
lesson is being relearned that
the art of good government is
an art that conceals art. By a
perversity of fate, the Attlee
Government was in fact dig-
ging the grave of Socialism.
Gone are the hungry and the
oppressed, the embittered and
the rebellious. They have be-
come respectable, well-pro-
visioned citizens, resistant to
change.
“More than anything else
this is what is behind the
failure of the Opposition —the
steady progress of the Govern-
ment and the revival of
Liberalism. The Socialists,
struggling with their doctri-
naire straitjacket, have proved
unable to redefine the role of
an Opposition in a peace-time
Parliament. It is being more
and more recognised that the


Eatfk iit Ihc

Science at the national level is a sound
investment for any country.
For Australia, I believe, the founding of the
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation is one of the wisest investments we
have made.
The total cost of the C.5.1.R.0. in its thirty
years to last June was £35 million. Much more
than that amount is being saved or won each
year through the benefits it has brought to
Australian production.
The application of trace elements to minerally-
deficient soils has led to a complete upward
revision of the country’s ultimate potential in
farms and pastures.
The use of myxomatosis in the destruction
of rabbits is estimated to have resulted in
an over-all increase of £5O million a year in
primary production.
Latterly the work of two C.5.1.R.0. officers
has been attracting notable attention abroad.
Americans are actively interested in Mr. W. W.
Mansfield’s discovery that the spreading of a
cheap chemical, hexadecanol, over the surface of
stored water will reduce considerably its rate
of evaporation.
Overseas rights to Mr. Ivan Newnham’s process
for isolating zirconium from the hafnium usually
found with it in ore have been bought by the U.S.
National Distillers Products Corporation for
250,000 dollars (about £A111,000). Zirconium is
an ideal metal for use in thermal nuclear reactors.
These, and other discoveries have done more
than serve their own magnificent purpose: they
have earned for Australia, in its own right, a
recognition in the field of modern research.
It is well for us to appreciate what this means
to the national future.
In going to meet the clearly indicated
expansion that lies ahead for Australia, we have
every reason to raise our sights. But let us
remember that our high hopes rely very much on
the work of men and women devoted to the cause
of research; and that the standard of our whole
productive effort will be set by the outcome of
their patient studies.
Liberals could have provided a
more flexible, radical Opposi-
tion, more in tune with the
times and the political set-up of
the day. The voter will base
his judgment in the election
not on the record, not on the
paper pledges, but on the
political implications of his
mode of life.”
Trouble in Laos
Commenting on the fresh out-
break of disturbances in
Laos, the “Yorkshire Post”
notes that “it is not the first
time, when relations between
Russia and the Western demo-
cracies looked like improving,
that a sudden storm has blown-
up in the Far East.”:
“There are some minds in
the West who will see the new
trouble in Laos as part of a
general Communist world
strategy to raise the price to
be obtained for a settlement
over Berlin. No doubt Mr.
Khrushchev wishes there were,
so closely co-ordinated a
Russo-Chinese strategy ; but in
fact, and only too clearly, it is
a case of the tail wagging or
trying to wag the dog, while
no one can be sure which is
tail and which is dog.
“The Chinese Communists
are not directly involved in
Laos Out of the confused pic-
ture from the northern pro-
vinces of that country, what
emerges is that the forces act-
ing against the Royal Govern-
ment are mainly Communist-
dominated men of a Laotian
tribe, to which have been added
remnants of the Pathet Lao
guerrilla forces which led the
fight against the French occu-
pation. The Laotian Govern-
ment has claimed the discovery
of documentary proof that
North Vietnamese (Com-
munist) troops carried-out an
intervention last month. This
has been strongly denied by
North Vietnam, and in any
case it is not a very serious
accusation in such an area. The
charge does not on the face of
it look a likely one, for at the
time the leader of the North
Vietnam regime, Mr. Ho Chi-
minh, was ‘on holiday’ in
Russia.... Mr. Ho would not
expect Mr. Khrushchev to look
with favor on any such ad-
venture at that particular time
when the Soviet leader was
busily arranging his long-
hoped-for visit to Washing-
ton and President Eisen-
hower’s return visit to Moscow.
“But if the Kremlin would
not have favored it, the For-
bidden City of Peking probably
would. It may be significant
that the Laotian Government
claims to have captured rebel
weapons which were manu-
factured in Czechoslovakia and
China. The Chinese Commu-
nists may be working up to
another of those obsessive
brainstorms which seem
dangerously to overtake them
from time to time.
“Yet the Western democ-
racies should try to look at the
scene from both sides, not just
one. It seems obviously ad-
vantageous to the democracies
if there are serious differences
at the moment between
Moscow and Peking. But we
should remember that Mr.
Khrushchev willy-nilly must
reckon with China, just as
China must reckon with Mr.
Khrushchev. If Communists
directed from Peking throw a
spanner in the works to hinder
Mr. Khrushchev’s moves for
a reconciliation or rapproche-
ment with the United States,
that is no advantage to the
cause of world peace ; it is just
what ‘Pravda’ accuses Bonn of
trying to do.”
Whither Defence?
Tn London “Spectator,”
Christopher Hollis stresses
the need for a reappraisal of
Britain’s policy on nuclear arms
and defence “ —the policy as a
result of which we dare not
fight a nuclear war and cannot
fight any other war—the policy
which combines the disadvan-
tages of unilateral disarma-
ment with the heaviest military
budget that we have ever had
to bear —the policy which is
as dead as the dodo or as the
Labor party.
“Now there are of course
experts—men of wisdom and
goodwill—who are giving their
minds to these problems and
preparing to make the appro-
priate switches when the time
comes; and it is natural
enough if those experts some-
times complain that the public
debates are so largely carried
on by ill-informed and irrespon-
sible people. But, if it be so,
whose is the fault? The fault
is the fault of the leading poli-
ticians, who have access to
official information, who could
have carried on a responsible
debate for the purpose of
informing public opinion, but
who have preferred to give
their minds to the invention of
trick formulas and slogans for
preserving a facade of unity in
their parties.
“The Labor party is like a
parody of a Church and the
Conservative party is like a

parody of a regiment. There
is obviously something in the
argument that, if we cannot
abolish nuclear weapons
altogether, at least we mini-
mise the risk of an accident
if they are not allowed to
pass into the hands of
an indeterminate number of
Powers; and Mr. Gaitskell
has a point when he challenges
Mr. Macmillan to show in
what way his policy of ‘inde-
pendence’ through the posses-
sion of the bomb has been
greater than that of General
de Gaulle or Dr. Adenauer.
“But, if the bomb has not
increased our influence, the
logical conclusion is .that we
should abandon it. There was
a time when the general self-
denying ordinance of the non-
nuclear club might have been
accepted. The Socialists with
some care have delayed making
the proposal until they are
quite sure that it will not be
accepted. Whatever we may
think of his other activities, we
can hardly quarrel with Mr.
Cousins [leader of the Trans-
port and General Workers’
Union] for stigmatising this
proposal as an absurdity.
“If the Conservatives had a
coherent defence policy to
oppose to the incoherence of
the Socialists, the desirability
of a Conservative victory
could hardly be even a matter
of debate. But have they?
They have admittedly an
apparent coherence because,
N .Y. "Herald Tribune.”
NOW WHAT HAVE WE GOT COOKING?
whereas the Socialists conduct
their searches for the Emperor’s
clothes in public, the Conserva-
tives prefer to elect a leader
who assures them with a
superior smile that, whatever
appearances may suggest, the
Emperor has got his clothes alt
right, and they all believe him.
“Now, though no one can
pretend that the personality-
cult is a very democratic way
of settling policy, it is at least a
way of settling policy ; and, on
a problem on which the public
must necessarily be imperfectly
informed, it is arguable that it
is the best way of settling it.
But we can only feel comfort-
able with it if we can feel
assured that the wise leaders
whom we are trusting to do
our thinking for us are really
thinking. Since Suez it has
been hardly possible to have
that confidence, and although
Mr. Macmillan is a very
different man from Sir Anthony
Eden, his recent excursions
over the world have not given
much of an impression that he
is certain even in his own
mind what he is proposing to

Henry Brandon, Washington
representative of London “Sun-
day Times,” after a visit to
Russia : “In his [Khrushchev’s]
eyes it is only the United States
that matters. All other
countries are for him but
pawns on the chess-board. He
is obsessed with the United
States. So, too—at least, that
was my inescapable impres-
sion—is everybody in the
Soviet Union. When Mr.
Khrushchev told the nine
American Governors who
recently visited Soviet Russia:
‘lf anyone starts a war, to-
gether we could stop it,’ he
summed-up his basic idea in
international affairs: Russia
and the United States should
divide the world and run it
between them.
“In domestic affairs he holds
up American achievements as
the shining example. He has
shrewdly realised that the
nebulous goal of Communism
has no real meaning for the
Soviet man of today. I asked
many intelligent people, in and
outside the party, what they
imagine Communism to mean.
Most of .them shrugged their
shoulders. Some suggested that
it means a paradise in which
most work will be done auto-
matically by machines.”

Elspeth Huxley, in London
“Time and Tide” ; “The
dilemma of the [U.K.]
Socialists is really touching.
Unrestricted, democratic, one-
man - one - vote self-rule in
Africa is their rallying-cry. The
first thing every free African
Government has done so far
is to discard the Western forms
of this uncongenial system and
have a nice, colorful autocracy
or military dictatorship. What
should Socialists do? Back
self-rule plus autocracy? Or
stick-out for democracy (a
doubtful starter anyway),
which means slowing things
down?
“They have in fact backed
the first course, but lack the
honesty to admit its implica-
tions, and are trying to cover-
up by attacking the Tories for
not following a policy which
would end hopes of democracy
in Africa. The Tories have
backed the second course,
which is more honest but much
less popular, and possibly un-
attainable. It will land them
in trouble for a certainty.”

London “Spectator” : “The
British Government ‘looks
forward to the restoration of
normal conditions in Nyasa-
land.’ Can it not realise that
there have been no normal con-
ditions in Nyasaland or
Northern Rhodesia since
Federation was imposed in
1953? And that they can only
be attained by the most far-
reaching changes in the rela-
tions between the Central
African territories? Sir Roy
Welensky believes that the way
to treat the natives is not to
listen to what they want but
to force upon them what he
thinks good for them; and
this can only be countered by
a return to the traditional
British policy in which the
paramountcy of African
interests is restored and
vigorously pursued in both
countries.”

hope to do much in the garden-
ing line.
December 25. Christmas
Day, and a very wet Christmas,
too. The weather changed the
day before yesterday and today
it is a regular downpour ; warm
rain, however, so we do not
much mind. I have been think-
of you much this morning and
hoping you will have a very
happy Christmas. We are quite
a large party here as, besides
the rest, Mr. Devlin got back
yesterday evening from his
expedition, having travelled
about eight hundred miles in
five weeks. Alick, the black boy
who was with him, got very
nearly killed by the wild blacks
while he was out. Mr. Devlin
left him in the camp one day
while he went round to explore
the country, and a whole mob
of blacks came out of the
scrub and attacked Alick by
throwing spears at him. He
had a revolver and a double-
barrelled carbine with him, and
he kept firing and wounded
several. They evidently had
never seen firearms before, for
they did not mind them till one
or two of them were wounded
and then they all ran for their
lives. Alick had a narrow
escape, for Mr. Devlin picked
up eleven spears that had been
thrown into the camp. Two
went through his trousers, but
without wounding him.
Annie is busy about the
Christmas dinner and Mr.
Hedgeland is helping her. It
consists of roast beef, two
brace of wild ducks, which
Mr. Taylor shot yesterday,
plum pudding, apple tart and
mince-pies, with pumpkin and
okra for vegetables and water-
melons for dessert. Not so bad
a bill of fare for the Far North.
Biddulph was busy yesterday
distributing fresh beef and
currants to the shepherds, also
rum in judicious quantities. It
is a great blessing that there
is no public house near here,
so that they can only have
what is given them. At Marl-
borough nearly every shepherd
got tipsy on Christmas Day,
and were all lying helpless
under the trees while their
flocks were meandering at will-
over the country. Biddulph,
Mr. Taylor and Mr. Hedge-
land spent their Christmas Day
in hunting for lost sheep, which
they afterwards had to shep-
herd.
A black grinning face has
just appeared at the window
with “me want master.” The
face belongs to Alick, who has
been following Biddulph about
all day with entreaties for
“grog” which he does not get.
I hear a sort of babel in the
kitchen, in the midst of which
Mary Anne and John are
preparing a Christmas dinner
for their own family, and also
for four Irish laborers that we
have employed on the station.
The shearers, nine in number,
have a cook of their own and

“Whether We like it or not, Captain, We're known
as Shiny-er-Seats!"
buy their own extra rations,
everything except flour, beef,
tea and sugar. They pay a man
about £2 a week to cook for
them while they are shearing.
Christmas Eve, yesterday, was
signalised by ar'’ chase and
capture on the station. One of
the shepherds came in the night
before and said that his hut,
which is near the road, had
been robbed, while he was out
with his sheep, and his blankets,
clothes and rations stolen.
Biddulph gave him some more
blankets. Yesterday afternoon
Julian came in in a state of
great excitement to say that
the man who had stolen the
things had just passed the
station, and that the shepherd
had recognised the blankets he
was carrying.
Biddulph mounted Julian’s
horse and went off through the
bush at a gallop. Pat, Mr.
Palmer’s man, followed, also
on horseback, and everybody
else on the station ran.
Biddulph presently came
back with the culprit mounted
on Pat’s horse. He conducted
him up to the stockyard, and
the whole of the property was
found in his possession. More-
over, he had borrowed Pat’s
horse the day before, promising
to leave it at Exmoor, where
he said his own horse was left,
and then had ridden it on past
the station evidently with the
intention of stealing it.
Biddulph said he could not
have the trouble and expense
of sending him to Port Denison
in custody, one hundred and
ten miles, and afterwards
appearing against him at Rock-
hampton, three hundred and
seventy miles off. So he had
him then and there tied up to
a tree and soundly flogged, Pat,
who is a stout Irishman, being
the executioner; and he
bestowed two dozen with
hearty goodwill, stimulated by
the remembrance of his wrongs
about the horse.
Justice being administered
in this summary manner,
Biddulph gave the man some
rations that he might not be
obliged to rob any more shep-
herds at stations and sent him
off, at the same time warning
the shepherds all down the
road to look after their huts.
I have just been hearing the
exploits of Ned, the shearers’
cook: how he borrowed our
three camp-ovens and sat up
all night cooking for today,
when he could have had the
said camp-ovens.
The productions of his
genius were beheld this morn-
ing by the wondering eyes of
Mr. Taylor. Two great cakes,
six jam tarts, small cakes and
unlimited plum puddings and
beef. I think it is fortunate
that the weather is so wet, and
that they will not be required
to shear tomorrow.
December 30. I finish my
letter today, as there will be
a chance of sending it as soon
as the river is down. It has
rained ever since Christmas
Day, and both the Bowen and
Broken Rivers are in flood and
the road to Port Denison im-
passable for the present. A
man was sent out yesterday on
horseback to try and swim the
Bowen to carry rations to the
Shepherds at the Nine Mile,
but he came back with the news
that the river was “bank to
bank,” and so much timber
coming down that he was
afraid to risk swimming his
horse. Of course the shearing
is stopped and the wash-pool is
washed away. The rainy
season has set-in early this
year.
Your very affectionate sister,
RACHEL HENNING.


breakers revealed more sub-
merged rocks, and Colin was
already calculating their
chances of clearing them.
Quite possibly there was a safe
channel between the two reefs,
but he dared not risk it. The
only prudent course lay to sea-
ward.
As if she knew what was
expected of her the little ketch
buried her lee-rail and ran,
lying closer to the wind than
Colin would have believed
possible for a craft of her rig.
She cleared the second reef
with half-a-mile to spare, and
only when the cape was five
miles astern did Colin free-off
and resume his northerly
course.
Another skipper would have
abused Kelly for his failure to
keep a proper lookout, but
Colin merely said quietly
“That was a close shave. You
should have called me sooner.”
“It was the rain,” Kelly
protested. “I’m lookin’ ahead
and divil a thing but open
water to be seen, whin down
comes this squall. Not a thing
can I see for five or maybe
ten minits, and then the squall
clears off and there I am, nigh
on to shakin’ hands wid the
crabs on the rocks, in a
manner of speakin’.”
Towards noon they sighted
a break in the coastline. It
could have been the entrance
to a harbor or it could have
been the mouth of a large river.
Wishful thinking prompted
Kelly to suggest it was the
river they were looking for,
but Colin didn’t agree. Unless
he had greatly underestimated
the Ellida’s speed they were
still well to the south of their
destination.
Moreover, his view from the
mountain-top had shown that
their river emptied into a bay
studded with islands, and there
were no islands here. In all
probability, he said, they were
looking at the entrance of Port
Curtis, discovered and named
by Flinders 53 years ago.
Shortly before dark they
rounded a headland,
worked cautiously up under
its lee, and dropped anchor.
“This,” Colin announced,
indicating the vast island-
studded bay with a wave of
his arm, “is Keppel Bay. And
judging by the color of the
water we’re not far from the
river-mouth.” He ran his
fingers through his beard and
instead of scowling at the salty
tangle he smiled happily.
“We’ll start at daybreak, and
tomorrow night we’ll be camp-
ing ashore at the new home-
stead site.”
But for once he was over-
optimistic.
Next morning they found
the sea between the cape and
the river-mouth so studded
with rocks and shoals that they
were constantly tacking and
altering course to avoid them.
Small wonder Cook hadn't
investigated it more closely!
And the river-mouth, when
they finally reached it, presented
its own set of problems, for
instead of one river several
broad arms entered the sea in
an estuary nearly five miles
across.
There were several delays
while they searched for the
main stream and in the mean-
time the tide turned against
them. Then, in the river, dense
mangroves hemmed them in,
“I've avoided the easy trap of optimism. ”
blanketing the wind so that
often the sails flapped idly
while the strong ebb-tide
swept them back downstream.
Taking everything into con-
sideration, Colin estimated
their forward speed at less than
three knots.
At five that afternoon, when
the glare from the setting sun
made it impossible to distin-
guish gleaming brown water
from gleaming wet mud, the
Ellida slid gently up on to a
mudbank. Colin would have
gone over the side in an effort
to push her off had Kelly not
protested that the river was
probably full of alligators.
“Don’t you do it, Mr.
Colin,” he pleaded. “I wouldn’t
risk so much as a toe in that
water.”
Colin smiled, and said “I
doubt if we could move her in
any case. The tide’s falling too
fast.” He shrugged resignedly.
“We’d better get the sails
down. She won’t float until
the night tide lifts her and
we can’t continue upstream
until daylight.”
Although both men were
used to the hardships of the
bush, that night was the
longest and most uncomfort-
able either of them could
remember. As the tide left her
the Ellida heeled-over steeply
and after sundown swarms of
mosquitoes arrived. All night
long their whining, stinging
attacks continued, making
sleep impossible. Scratching
and slapping wildly at the
pests Kelly listened to the night
noises of the river and cursed
the fate that had brought him
so'far north.
Why, he wailed, did anyone
want to leave good holdings
in the south and come up here
to this desolate abode of sting-
ing insects, wild animals and
savages? A land of mangroves
and mud! In an entire day’s
sailing they had only sighted
one patch of open country,
and any pleasure he might
have felt at the sight of it had
been ruined by the appearance
of a party of wild blacks
armed to the teeth with spears
and waddies. A hunting-
party, his new boss had called
them! Hunting what? White
men’s heads, no doubt! Why
provide them with material?
Why not let them keep their
cursed country?
When the flood-tide gurgled
under the Ellida’s stern he
swore it was cannibals swim-
ming out to board them and
claim their scalps, and once
when a drifting log bumped
and scraped its way along the
ship’s side he yelled that
alligators were clawing their
way aboard.
Despite his own discomfort
Colin smiled at Kelly’s fears.
“Tomorrow,” he promised,
“I’ll show you land as fine as
any you’ve seen. Rich grazing
and farming land. There’s a
big future up here, Kelly.
Before long this north will
form a separate State with
Brisbane as the capital. And
one day there’ll be a town on
the banks of this river.”
Kelly wasn’t comforted.
In his opinion only lunatics
would come this far north.
He doubted whether they were
in the right river, was con-
vinced that they would never
link-up with the overland
party and gloomily resigned to
the belief that his restless urge
had finally driven him too far
and that he would not live to
see the dawn.
dawn found
them once more under-
way, gliding steadily upstream
with the aid of a fair wind
and a flood-tide. Mangroves
gave way to open forest-
country, rich country backed
by heavily-timbered ranges,
and at 11.30 the Ellida rounded
a bend and her crew saw proof
of the soundness of Colin’s
navigation.
“It’s a horse, begob!” Kelly
shouted excitedly. “A grey
horse tethered to a tree!”
“Aye,” Colin agreed quietly.
“That’s Sleipner, my brother’s
favorite - horse. There’s no
mistaking him.”
Kelly danced a jig on the
foredeck. They had made it!
They had brought their ship
through all manner of dangers
and arrived at the right place!
What a surprise the overland
party would get at seeing them
here, safe and sound! What
a grand welcome there would
be, with himself sharing in the
congratulations ! In his
excitement he forgot the
manner of men he was deal-
ing with.
Colin nosed the Ellida in to
the bank and called, “Hullo
there, Charles.”
A tall, bearded man wear-
ing a grey-flannel shirt and
white-moleskin trousers rose
from the long grass in the
shade of the tree and raised
an arm in greeting.
“Hello there, Colin,” he
called. “You’re late. I was
beginning to think you’d got
yourself entangled with some
wench in Maryborough.”


A Truly Great Man
A Mid-Pacific Sketch
(1893)
By LOUIS BECKE
IN those days the fat-faced
native missionary was an
unknown quantity in the
Tokelaus and Kingsmiiis,
and the local white trader
answered all requirements. He
was generally a rough charac-
ter a runaway from some
Australian or American
whaler, or a wandering Ishmael
who, for reasons of his
own, preferred living among
the intractable, bawling and
poverty - stricken people of
the equatorial Pacific to
dreaming away his days in the
monotonously happy valleys
of the Society and Marquesas
groups.
Cuch a man was Probyn,
who dwelt on one of the
low atolls of the Ellice Islands.
He had landed there one day
'from a Sydney whaler with a
chest of clothes, a musket or
two, and a tierce of tobacco ;
also a savage - eyed, fierce-
looking native wife, over whose
shoulders fell long waves of
black hair, and a child about
five years old.
The second-mate of the
whaler, who was in charge of
the boat, not liking the looks
°f the natives that swarmed
around the newcomer, bade
him a hurried farewell, and
pushed away to the ship, which
lay-to off the passage with her
tore-yard aback. Then the
clamorous natives pressed
more closely around Probyn
and his wife, and assailed them
with questions.
So far neither of them had
spoken. Probyn, a tall, wiry,
scanty-haired man, was stand-
ing with' one foot on the tierce
of tobacco and his hands in
his pockets. His wife glared,
defiantly at some two- or three-
score of women who crowded
eagerly around her to stare
into her face ; holding to the
sleeve of her dress was the
child, paralysed into the silence
of. fright.
'JTtE deafening babble and
frantic gesticulations were
perfectly explicable to Probyn,
and he apprehended no danger.
The head man of the town had
not yet appeared, and until he
came this wild license of
behavior would continue. At
iast the natives became silent
and parted to the right and
left as Tahori, the head-man,
his fat body shining with
coconut-oil and carrying an
ebony-wood club, stood in
front of the white man and
e yed him up and down. The
scrutiny seemed satisfactory.
He stretched out his huge,
naked arm and shook Probyn’s
hand, uttering his one word of
Samoan — “Talofa!” —and then,
in his own dialect, he asked:
“What is your name, and what
do you-want?”
“Sam,” replied Probyn. And
then, in the Tokelau language,
which the wild-eyed people
around him fairly understood,
“I have come here to live with
you and trade for oil” —and
he pointed to the tierce of
tobacco.
“Where are you from?”
“From the land called Nuku-
nono, in the Tokelau.” '
“Why come here?”
“Because I killed someone
there.”
“Good!” grunted the fat
man. “There are no twists in
your tongue ; but why did the
boat hasten away so quickly?”
“They were frightened be-
cause of the noise. He with
the face like a fowl’s talked
too much” —and he pointed to
a lone, hatchet-visaged native,
who had been especially turbu-
lent and vociferous.
“XTa!” and the fat, bearded
face of Tahori turned from
the white man to him of whom
the white man had spoken—
“ls it thee, Makoi? And so
thou madest the strangers
hasten away! That was
wrong. Only for thee I had
gone to the ship and gotten
many things. Come here!”
Then he stooped and picked
up one of Probyn’s muskets,
handed it to the white man,
and silently indicated the tall
native with a nod. The other
natives fell back. Niabong,
Probyn’s wife, set her boy on
his feet, put her hand in her
bosom and drew out a key,
with which she opened the
chest. She threw back the lid,
fixed her black eyes on Probyn,
and waited.
Probyn, holding the musket
in his left hand, mused a
moment. Then he asked:
“Whose man is he?”
“Mine,” said Tahori, “he is
from Oaitupu, and my bond-
man.”
“Has he a wife?”
“No, he is poor and works
in my puraka field.”
“Good,” said Probyn, and
he motioned to his wife. She
dived her hand into the chest
and handed him a tin of pow-
der, then a bullet, a cap and
some scraps of paper.
Slowly he loaded the musket,
and Tahori, seizing the bond-
man by his arm, led him out
to the open, and stood by,
club in hand, on the alert./
Probyn knew his reputation
depended on the shot. .The ball
passed through the chest of
Makoi. Then four men picked
up the body and carried it into
a house
T)robyn laid down the musket
A and motioned again to
Niabong. She handed him a
hatchet and blunt chisel.
Tahori smiled pleasantly, and
drawing the little boy to him
patted his head.
Then, at a sign from him,
a woman brought Niabong a
shell of sweet toddy. The
chief sat cross-legged on the
ground and watched Probyn
opening the tierce of tobacco.
Niabong locked the box again
and sat upon it.
“Who are you?” said
Tahori, still caressing the boy.
“Niabong. But my tongue
twists with your talk here. I
am of Naura [Pleasant Island],
By and bye 1 will understand
it.”
“True. He is a great man,
thy man,” said the chief,
nodding at Probyn.
“A great man, truly. There
is not one thing in the world
but he can do it.”
“E moe,” said the fat man
approvingly, “I can see it.
Look you, he shall be as my
brother, and thy child here
shall eat of the best in the
land.”
Probyn came over with his
two hands filled with sticks
of tobacco. “Bring a basket,”
he said.
A young native girl slid out
from the coconuts at Tahori’s
bidding and stood behind him,
holding a basket. Probyn
counted out into it 200 sticks.
“See, Tahori. I am a just
man to thee because thou art
a just man to me. Here is
the price of him that thou
gavest to me.”
Tahori rose and beckoned
to the people to return —“Look
at this man. He is a great man.
His heart groweth from his
loins upward to his throat.
Bring food to my house
quickly, that he and his wife
and child may eat. And to-
morrow shall every man cut
wood for the house, _a house
that shall be in length ten
fathoms and five in width.
Such men as he come from the
gods.”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
What Kind of New Deal?
1 sincerely hope the optimism
of “New Deal for the North”
(B. 5/8/’59) is justified. The
personnel seems sound, and its
members are adopting the right
approach in making two trips,
in the “dry” and in the “wet,”
for the Territory in August is
a vastly different place from
the Territory in January. But
somehow I have my doubts
about the ultimate outcome.
Sir George Buchanan made
a very comprehensive report
back in 1925. The Payne Com-
mittee made another in 1937.
Certainly the Territory got a
railway of sorts to Alice
Springs as a result in part,
anyhow—of the Payne report.
Sir George’s recommendations
are still on the shelf. Had they
been implemented, there would
probably have been half-a-
million people in the Territory
and Kimberleys today, instead
of less than 25,000.
It must be emphasised that
the whole future of the Terri-
tory is bound-up with markets,
and markets presuppose com-
munications. Sir George was
emphatic that railways linking
the South Australian and
Queensland systems were the
prime essential of any scheme
of land-settlement. In my
opinion they still are. I’d feel
a lot happier if the committee-
of-inquiry had been the
Federal Public Works Com-
mittee, charged with the duty
of reporting to Parliament as
to the cost and route (not the
need) of railways linking
Darwin with Sydney and
Adelaide.
In existing circumstances
the only agricultural crop with
“In the language of the trade, madam, onion
embraces garlic !”
a potential is rice, which can
be shipped from Darwin. But
a lot of other things could be
grown for southern markets
if rail-transport were available,
with a service of express goods-
trains. South Australia alone
has a substantial market for
bananas, pineapples, and
winter-grown beans, tomatoes
and cucumbers, but 1000 miles
of road-transport plus 1000
miles of rail (with two breaks
of gauge and consequent addi-
tional handling-costs) just
shuts that market to Terii-
torians. D. C. Tilghman
(N.S.W.).
Educating Careless Drivers
When a Melbourne magi-
strate, some weeks back,
ordered a traffic-offender to
attend the casualty department
of a big hospital as an orderly
every second Saturday for six
months, he probably felt he
was helping to solve the diffi-
cult problem of educating
careless drivers.
But the hospital concerned,
faced with a protest from the
Hospital Employees’ Union,
was not very enthusiastic about
the idea; and eventually it
consented to allow the man to
attend as an observer only.
Now the Metropolitan Hos-
pitals’ Association has asked
the Victorian Crown Law
Department to ensure that such
an order will not be issued
again.
. The association pointed out
that hospitals were not houses
of correction, that the work
of a hospital staff could be up-
set by the presence of outsiders,
and that patients could justifi-
ably complain if watched by
persons not connected with the
hospital. It-also suggested that
legal problems could arise if
outsiders suffered , through
having to look at serious
accident-cases.
The association’s objections
are irrefutable ; hospitals have
a big job and can’t afford to
be looking after non-patients
semt along by the courts.
Nevertheless the magistrate in
question w'as merely trying to
bring home to an offender what
many motorists do not properly
realise that a motor-vehicle
can be a lethal instrument un-
less handled with great care.
He must have felt—doubt-
less through experience of
motorists convicted again and
again for offences against good
sense and traffic-regulations—
that a fine is no real deterrent;
it is paid and quickly forgotten.
What is needed is some means
of impressing upon the careless
driver what negligence can
cause in terms of human
suffering.
Education of this kind,
surely, lies within the powers
of the police. Classes for erring
motorists could be held
periodically, at which films of
actual accidents would be
shown, together with films and
lectures on driving-faults and
their correction. Attendance
at these classes could be made
compulsory for offending
drivers, and where necessary
the reissue of licences could
be made dependent upon
attendance.
In this way the negligent
driver could be educated in
road-sense in a graphic,
realistic manner, without
bothering hospital casualty-
wards. The classes should be
given a trial: with the present
accident-rate there should be
no shortage of pupils.—Wuss-
lean (Vic.).
Wyndham Report
What has happened to the
Wyndham Report on secondary
education in N.S.W.?
Last April, 18 months after
the issue of the report, Mr.
Heffron announced that the
Intermediate Certificate exami-
nation would be abolished
after 1961, and the Leaving
Certificate examination after
1963.
If this still holds, it means
presumably that pupils enter-
ing secondary school next year
will be the first to experience
the transition-year of “core”
subjects, the “elective” subjects
of subsequent years and the
external School Certificate and
Higher School Certificate
(matriculation) examinations.
It seems, however, that noth-
ing has been done to draw-up
new “core” and “elective”
courses of studies and to pre-
pare generally for the change-
over.
One can sympathise with Mr.
Heffron in view of the grow-
ing secondary enrolments and
shortage of teachers, but
parents are entitled to know
when it is proposed to intro-
duce the new courses and
examinations. He should con-
firm or withdraw his April
announcement without delay.

Pensioners’ Rates
The municipality I live in
does not require ratepayers
on the old-age pension to meet
their rate-charges unless they
prefer to do so, but hitherto
it has refused to write their
rates off (B. 22/7/’59). Rates
are allowed to accumulate and
are charged to the estate when
the pensioner dies, unless

another pensioner succeeds in
| ownership.
This attitude to the prob-
lem of pensioners’ rates is
more reasonable than writing
them off altogether. A pen-
sioner with no other source of
livelihood than the pension is
helped, but the council eventu-
ally recoups the rates due.
Owner-pensioners are the best-
off in that section.
For many, with working
relatives living with them and
keeping the house going, the
pension is only pocket-money.
One pensioner neighbor of
mine, who died a few years
ago, had two middle-aged
daughters, both in good jobs,
living with him. Another has
his married daughter living
with him. He admitted frankly
to a friend that he didn’t spend
all his pension, but was bank-
ing some of it. His son-in-law
is a prosperous citizen, owner
of a swanky, new-model car.
Numerous cases of the kind
can be found.
In municipalities where
there are numerous cottages
owned by elderly occupiers,
freedom from rates for pen-
sioners may well mean higher
rates for everyone else. Rent-
paying pensioners—a section
generally worse off than their
owner-pensioner brethren
get no rent-concessions.
The inheritor of a pen-
sioner’s house is often a rela-
tive in comfortable circum-
stances, who, having a home
of his own, sells the inherit-
ance.
Why shouldn’t such people
have to contribute to muni-
cipal revenue through having
to refund the pensioner’s
accumulated rate-charges?

TV Programmes
“D.J.G.” (B. 22/7/’59) cites
TV as one of the reasons for
the declining market for short-
stories. There’s another side
to the picture—the decline, for
the same reason, of the market
for radio-scripts, which have
provided a livelihood, full or
part, for a number of Aus-
tralian writers for many
years.
With the coming of TV this
was not altogether unexpected,
hut most established script-
writers hoped, reasonably
enough, that within a year or
two there would be a ready
market for TV-scripts.
Not so. True, there’s been
a competition or two for the
“best Australian TV-play,”
hut, of the entries received,
“I Wanna be DRY -cleaned!”
only the prizewinners are
likely to grace the screen, and
even these seem singularly
slow in appearing. Otherwise
our script-writers have been
left for dead.
Commercial TV-channels in
Melbourne and Sydney have
not at any stage asked the
public what it wishes to view.
They have simply confronted
our gaze and assailed our ears
with one American-produced
“drama” after another —mostly
of the shot-a-second variety.
The reason’s not far to seek.
These American programmes
are virtually “dumped” here
and are for sale at a fraction
of the cost of their production
in America. They do nothing
for the Australian audience,
except to take up, from where
the picture-theatres left off, the
task of Americanising this
nation.
It will be argued that it
costs a lot more to produce a
TV-programme in Australia
than to buy one ready-made
from across the world. Of
course it does, and will con-
tinue to do so while Australian
production-units with the
equipment, the technical
knowledge, the talent and the
ability to make programmes—
are frozen into immobility and
sponsors buy cheap from
America, blithely disregarding
the effect on young (and not
so young) minds of such rub-
bish as “Kookie Talk” and
gangster jargon.
But let the Australian units
once get a start —let them sell
even enough programmes to
make it worth their while
making more —and the price
of the local product will rapidly
come into line and eventually,
perhaps, into competition with
the overseas market.
Even should it continue to
cost more, the Australian
sponsor should be well
rewarded if he supports a local
programme. He has something
to sell —but to Americans?
No, to Australians. Why not,
then, choose an Australian
drama as the vehicle for his
sales-message? The over-
whelming popularity' of the
radio - programme about
“people just like ourselves”
has always been recognised.
TV-programmes of the same
kind would be equally well
received, with a corresponding
build-up of goodwill for the
sponsor and a readier sale for
his product.— Stanford (Vic.).
Service Pensions
I’ve been drawing a service-
pension since 1945 —just a
token pension, as I’m assured
every so often, which entitles
me to treatment if I ever need
it, and which I never see
because it’s paid into my bank-
account. Every so often—it
may be every 12 months, as
“Gaba Tepe” says (B. 5/8/’59)
—l’m required to fill-in a
form. That takes me a few
minutes and doesn’t worry me
one iota. Also every so often
I’m asked to present myself
for an examination.
This used to annoy me and
waste my time, and I often
threatened to relinquish the
pension ; until it dawned on
me that the medicos were far
more concerned with my
health than I was. They’re
not trying to reduce my pen-
sion ; they’re keeping an eye
on me and my disability to
see that it doesn’t increase
without my becoming aware
of it. It could* easily, because
I’m far too busy to take note
of such things; and now I’m
happy to turn that worry over
to them and leave it at that.
I’m satisfied, each time they
assure me there’s no need for
the pension to be increased,
that I’ve got nothing to worry
about. And, by and large, I’m
pretty grateful to a system,
even if it’s bound-up with red-
tape, that has more concern
for my health than I have.—
Kelms (W.A.).


BALLADS OF QUEENSLAND
NORTHWARD TO THE SHEDS
There’s a whisper from the regions out
beyond the Barwon banks;
There’s a gathering of the legions and a
forming of the ranks;
There’s a murmur coming nearer with
the signs that never fail,
And it’s time for every shearer to be out
upon the trail.
They must leave their girls behind them
and their empty glasses, too,
For there’s plenty left to mind them
when they cross the dry Barcoo;
There’ll be kissing, there’ll be sorrow such
as sweethearts only know,
But before the noon tomorrow they’ll be
singing as they go —
For the Western creeks are calling,
And the idle days are done,
With the snowy fleeces falling
And the Queensland sheds begun !
There is shortening of the bridle, there is
tightening of the girth,
There is fondling of the idol that they
love the best on earth ;
Northward from the Lachlan River and
the sun-dried Castlereagh,
Outward to the Never-Never ride the
ringers on their way.
From the green bends of the Murray
they have run their horses in,
For there’s haste and there is hurry when
the Queensland sheds begin;
On the Bogan they are bridling, they are
saddling on the Bland,
There is plunging and there’s sidling—for
the colts don’t understand
That the Western creeks are calling,
And the idle days are done.
With the snowy fleeces falling
And the Queensland sheds begun !
They will camp below the station, they’ll
be cutting peg and pole,
Rearing tents for occupation till the call-
ing of the roll;
And it’s time the nags were driven, and
it’s time to strap the pack,
For there’s never licence given to the
laggards on the track.
Hark the music of the battle! It is time
to bare our swords:
Do you hear the rush and rattle as they
tramp along the boards?
They are past the pen-doors picking light-
wooled weaners one by one;
I can hear the shear-blades clicking, and
I know the fight’s begun!
WILL H. OGILVIE.
A BUSH CHRISTENING
On the outer Barcoo where the churches
are few,
And men of religion are scanty,
On a road never crossed ’cept by folk that
are lost
One Michael Magee had a shanty.
Now this Mike was the dad of a ten-year-
old lad,
Plump, healthy, and stoutly conditioned;
He was strong as the best, but poor Mike
had no rest
For the youngster had never been
christened.
And his wife used to cry, “If the dartin’
should die
Saint Peter would not recognise him.”
But by luck he survived till a preacher
arrived,
Who agreed straightway to baptise him.
Now the artful young rogue, while they
held their collogue,
With his ear to the keyhole was listenin’;
And he muttered in fright, while his
features turned white,
“What the divil and all is this
christenin’?”
He was none of your dolts —he had seen
them brand colts,
And it seemed to his small understanding,
If the man in the frock made him one of
the flock,
It must mean something very like brand-
ing.
So away with a rush he set off for the
bush,
While the tears, in his eyelids they
glistened—
“’Tis outrageous,” says he, “to brand
youngsters like me;
I’ll be dashed if I’ll stop to be
christened ! ”
Like a young native dog he ran into a log,
And his father with language uncivil,
Never heeding the “praste,” cried aloud
in his haste
“Come out and be christened, you divil! ”
But he lay there as snug as a bug in a rug,
And his parents in vain might reprove
him.
Till His Reverence spoke {he was fond
of a joke )
“I’ve a notion,” says he, “that’ll move
him.
“Poke a stick up the log, give the spalpeen
a prog ;
Poke him aisy—don’t hurt him or maim
him;
’Tis hot long that he’ll stand, I’ve the
water at hand,
As he rushes out this end I’ll name him.
“Here he comes, and for shame ! ye’ve
forgotten the name —
Is it Patsy or Michael or Dinnis ? ”
Here the youngster ran out, and the priest
gave a shout —
“Take your chance, anyhow, wid
‘Maginnis’! ”
As the howling young cub ran away to
the scrub
Where he knew that pursuit would be
risky,
The priest, as he fled, flung a flask at his
head
That was labelled “Maginnis's Whisky ! ”
And Maginnis Magee has been made a
J.P.,
And the one thing he hates more than
sin is
To be asked by the folk, who have heard
of the joke,
How he came to be christened Maginnis!
“BANJO” PATERSON.
QUEENSLAND STEERS
(From B. 25/3/ ? 42)
North of the netted border the grassland
rolls away
Over the downs and valleys, across the
foothills grey,
And there with snow-white faces and
shoulders flaring red
The wild-eyed sons of freedom, the
Queensland steers, are bred.
The spear-horned steers of Queensland!
The old grey drovers know
Wild tales of blood and battle, mad rides
with stars aglow,
When crashing through the thickets on
flats the night-dew damps
The squadrons of disaster have thundered
from the camps.
Calved to the coastal country, bred on
the blue-grass plains,
Run from the miles of mulga when white
foam creamed the reins,
Their myriad battalions have trooped the
stock-routes down
Since the Gulf was unknown country and
Brisbane just a town.
The Queensland scrubs are lonely and
Queensland plains are wide,
A nd over Queensland pastures the world’s
best stockmen ride;
And there upon our story in letters bright
as flame
The range-run steers of Queensland have
left a deathless name.

POETS OF TODAY
THE MOUNTAIN
The rude injustice of the mountain cuts
my window-view of sundown. All that
I see
is the purple bulk that could be five rich
minutes
more of day. This hunchback of a hill
lives here with me,
watches and catches me in his giant’s
shadow.
My error was to stay until he had
my measure, toiling in the lonely paddock
where he might fall upon my hatless head
did l run, seeking to escape, a loony lad.
My father in the dairy beat my head
when l was weary of the milking.
I had not heard my mother but she
argued,
her intercourse a screech, no womans
talking.
Her children ran away; the mountain
stayed,


the ugly hunchback mountain, all my
days
leeching five minutes with obnoxious
shade
each evening, while my anxious eyes
looked for the light lost with a child’s
amaze.
The mountain wandered never ; nor did I,
bereaved of all but this old huddling hill
and the sparse paddock where down its
shadow would lie
each night, a Cerberus at the bound gates
of Hell.
■ — Oh, steadfast, unadventurous eyes that
search,
still, the dark evenings for some proof
of light,
a candle burning in some mountain’s
church
that will give faith though 1 regain no
sight
of what my Master wills nor know him
right.
But this, my mountain, was inhuman
flesh,
not rock ; mortal as I; monstrous, near.
It lived life for my death; and every
fresh
breeze down its mountainsides brought
fear
to my crushed chest at evening when the
damp
so suddenly clamped fingers round
my voiceless throat and I sat by the lamp
listening for footsteps, used to each sly,
pale sound
of hunchback mountain and its shadow
hound.
Could I have known how long men wait
for death,
climbing that last five minutes of each
day,
/ might have breathed the last great
golden breath
of sunsets from the mountain-tops; and,
grey
as the night came, and the mountain, dark
as some stray blackamoor, I would hear
the song
that I remembered from the hours of
lark
and magpie carolling, while that great
clamorous gong
of the sun’s going-down gave loneliness
its tongue.
Ah, but the mocking mountain that
echoes
my gloom like a dark, blasphemous
sound,
and calls his shadow bloodhound at
my toes
waiting to spring upon me, in one bound
to cut off all escape : it is the sum
of self and soul, and we are one.
I know it in the morning when they
come,
the hunchback hill, his hound to escape
the sun
gone round to heel, this stealth of
another day begun.

TWO HAWKS
Being somewhat surfeited with the city
Which on a Sunday loses its spurious

I drove to the river
And saw two hawks
Soar over the water
And a river-gum
Spread to the sun,
And there was satisfaction to me
In some muddy water, two birds, and a
tree.
The experience cannot be bound
In my poor pattern of sound,
Though as Gulliver found
Threads bind effectively
If you’ve the quantity,
So perhaps 1 ought to go on
A bout the hawks and the gum
For a long time.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
QUEENSLAND WATER-HARVESTING
Tt is encouraging to those
who have been working
on the development of water-
conservation and irrigation
on individual holdings to
read of the widespread interest
in this development, as shown
by “Myall” (B. 17/6/’59) and
“J.H.” (B. 5/8/’59).
In Queensland the work has
received great assistance from
the Royal National Associa-
tion, which includes in its
year’s work a water-harvesting
competition. The first of
these, recently completed,
covered design and construc-
tion of a storage; design,
operation and maintenance of
an irrigation - system ; and
production of crops under
irrigation.
For 1958-59 the majority of
storages entered were indivi-
dual efforts, built without
technical assistance from the
department. To complete that
picture, the project which
scored highest points was built
to designs prepared by, and
constructed under the super-

wool process known as
“SI-RO-SET” is now
enjoying a world-wide
application for per-
manent setting of wool
fabrics.
About a dozen clothing
manufacturers in Ger-
many, France, Holland
and Belgium are already
using the process, which
is fairly well established
in Norway, Sweden and
Denmark, while over 50
manufacturers are using
the process in England.

vision of, the Irrigation and
Water Supply Commission.
But that was only part of the
story. The owner of the pro-
perty where it was constructed
had been meticulous in his
irrigation-practice and horti-
culture, and long before
the competition and his storage
had been thought of he had
been keeping accurate produc-
tion-records, so that he would
know just where he was
heading.
A banana-grower, who. got
his early experience around
Coff’s Harbor (N.S.W.), he
now has a typical “Coff’s
Harbor” banana-farm at The
Gap, -a few miles from Bris-
bane. His results are typical
of all those who took part in
the competition, so far as
production is concerned. He
has two banana-areas adjoin-
ing, one of which, of necessity
for the time being, he dry-
farms, so that he has been
able to produce comparative
records of the two methods.
From the dry-farmed area,
in a period when the ceiling-
price for bananas was 9d. a
pound, his bunches averaged
241 b. in weight, and in price
averaged 6s. lid. or 3yd. a
pound. From the irrigated
area, in a period when the
ceiling price was 7d. a pound,
his bunches averaged 481 b.,
and in price averaged 225. 6d.
or a pound. As well, he
has been able to grow a con-
siderable tonnage oj tomatoes
under irrigation. He has thus
established that irrigation has
doubled the quantity and
quality of his production.
Another small-crops grower,
winner of his section, with a
storage designed and built by
himself, has been able to grow
four crops during the year on
his area entered in the com-
petition, because irrigation has
given him control of his pro-
duction. Naturally, he does
not repeat this on the same
area each year, but follows
approved agricultural practice
to ensure that the fertility and
structure of his soil are
maintained.
The winner of the irrigated
sown-pastures section —and he
also won the agricultural-
crops section—entered a dam
built by a good contractor. In
its early days this dam, as
was the case with quite a
number of dams entered, had
bywash trouble, though by re-
design that has been minim-
ised. His storage was well
protected by timber from
winds responsible for evapora-
tion losses, and in addition, he,
alone among all the competi-
tors, made use of the cetyl-
alcohol raft to reduce evapora-
tion further. Evaporation is an
invisible process responsible
for appreciable loss of water,
and it is just as valuable to
save loss thus caused as it is
to store the water in the first
place. The use of windbreaks
is also to be commended.
Quite apart from that, in a
long-range plan timber can be
a very valuable crop in itself.
Many of the competitors
had storages on sites the suita-
bility of which might normally
have been doubtful, principally
because it was difficult to get
flood-flows safely back into the
gully below the dam without
damage to the bywash. The
frequent scouring of bywashes
was evident justification of
this “doubtful suitability.”
Yet those storages have,
generally, already paid for
themselves. And they have
given engineers associated
with this work scope for
assisting landowners to
improve those by washes and
stabilise the asset they have
created. The results of this
may well extend the range of
dam-sites on which storages
may safely be constructed.
The matter of Governments
making loans available to
landowners to assist them
store water on their own land
has long been attended to by
the Government in N.S.W.,
which in 1946 introduced its
Farm Water Supplies Act,
through which the Water Con-
servation and Irrigation Com-
mission provides technical and
financial assistance to land-
owners for all approved pro-
jects of improved water-
supplies.
In Queensland, the present
Government introduced in 1958
the Farm Water Supplies
Assistance Act, and in the first
year of its operation advances
totalling £60,000 were
approved. That represented
only a small part of the total
works for which technical
assistance was provided and
projects for which the land-
owners had made their own
financial arrangements.
These projects enable all the
benefits of irrigation to be
brought to areas which are
never likely to be included in
any major irrigation-scheme.
For the most part the capital-
cost an acre certainly does
not exceed the total cost an
acre of major schemes, and
they have the merit of being
private - enterprise projects —■
with technical and financial
assistance, where required,
provided by the Water Con-
servation and Irrigation
authorities.
Due acknowledgement must
be given to the work of such
men as H. J. Geddes, of
Badgery’s Creek (N.S.W.), who
has ably demonstrated, in the
practical operation of three
farms, what can be achieved
by water-harvesting, and has
freely made his information
and experience available to all
interested in the development

Lime
' “Ranger”: Lack of lime in
the food of sheep can cause
milk-fever. When no worth-
while rain has fallen in winter
the grass does not contain
enough lime to meet the
sheeps’ needs in late winter and
early spring, and so they draw
upon the mineral stores in
their bones.
This reserve is large ; but a
shortage of lime is likely,
especially if sheep are sub-
jected to any stress, like preg-
nancy, starvation or droving.
The remedy is to make sure
there’s enough lime in their
food to prevent this condition.
“JJ.A.”: A while back I
bought a half-hundredweight
bag of ground limestone, which
set me back 6s. 9d.
“What have you got there?”
asked a pigfarming neighbor.
“Ground limestone for the
pigs,” I told him.
“Wasting your money,” he
snapped.
His pigs pushed over the wall
of his sty and ate the mortar
to supply their need for lime.
At less than Id. a hundred-
weight of feed, my purchase
hardly seems to be “wasting
my money.”
Crofton and
Groundsel
“Alawa”: Touching on the
mention here of groundsel and
Crofton-weed, these are not,
of course, the same plant.
While the leaves of ground-
sel (Baccharis halimifolia) are
borne alternately along the
stems and have only a few large
teeth at the top, Crofton-weed
(Eupatorium adenophorum)
bears its almost wholly-toothed
leaves oppositely along the
stems. Leaves of Crofton-weed
are about twice the size of
those of groundsel. The female
groundsel has a fluffy appear-
ance when flowering, while the
flowers of Crofton-weed are
closely grouped in small, dense
heads, which form sprays about
3in. across at the ends of the
branches.
A stem-gall fly was intro-
duced from Hawaii in 1951 to
control Crofton-weed and,
although it hasn’t destroyed the
plant, it has at least slowed-
down its rate of spread.
The China - apple also
referred to —is common in
parts of North Queensland,
particularly in the poorer soils
about Townsville and Charters
Towers, but I know of only
two of these trees in the
Ingham district. These are
located on a property about 20
miles south of Ingham, arid in
all the years they have been
there they haven’t given any
indication of spreading. And
two China apple-trees can
hardly be considered “a
problem.”
Care of Cans
“Freddie”: Dropping milk-
cans or cream-cans or piling
them one on top of the other
is likely to dent them, and once
the surface of a can is dented
it’s almost certain the film of
tin covering the bare metal will
be fractured. Then the bare
surface starts to rust, and
rusty cans are a common
source of second-grade milk
or cream. The rust causes a
metallic flavor easily recognised
on the factory-platform. If a
lot of milk or cream is sent
daily to the factory, loss of
money caused by the lower
grades can be considerable.
The film of tin covering the
base metal in the can is not
very thick. With care it will
last for a number of years, but
it easily chips off in rough
usage.
Apart from dents on the
sides or bottom of the can,
the tinned surface can be
damaged by, for example, leav-
ing a can standing with milky
or creamy water in it. The
water will become acid as the
milk sours and will attack the
tin; soon small pitted rust-
spots will appear.
Using cleaning-agents like
caustic-soda in too strong a
solution will also weaken the
film of tin. Stacking wet cans
with their lids forced down
so that they can’t dry-out is
another way to weaken that
layer of tin and start rust-spots.
Cans will last for years if
carefully handled and if they
are washed as soon as they
come back from the factory.
Bulk-handling Fruit
“Pieter Nuyts”: Reduce
costs or go out of business?
That choice may not be con-
fronting Australian fruit-
growers yet, but it’s close
enough to make an assessment
worth while.
More farsighted growers
have already seen to cutting
costs, and it seems, speaking
generally, that the best chance
of doing so, lies in transporta-
tion. Individual growers may
find other items on which they
can do some profitable pruning,
but the industry as a whole will
find its greatest gain in reduc-
ing the cost of carrying fruit
from tree to customer. Remem-
ber, _ transportation of fruit
starts at the tree.
It would be easy to suggest
other avenues—for instance,
retailers’ profit-margins might
be reduced ; but the Australian
grower can’t do much about
retailers’ profits in Europe, and
it’s overseas markets that are
causing most concern. It’s
there that the cost of trans-
portation figures largest, so
that’s where the cutting may
have to be most drastic.
Bulk-handling could play an
important part. The first apples
to leave Australia in bulk-
containers were shipped from
Tasmania last year. The bins
used measured 62yin. by 44yin.
by 293 in. deep and gave an
internal capacity of 33.54 cu.-
ft.—approximately 25 bushels,
Built on a standard pellet-
tray, the framework of these
bins carried 3xl softwood,
with metal shields on the
corners. It was lined with
hardboard, soft side in to avoid
chafing the fruit, and was
strapped after lidding with four
strips of flatiron. Empty, it
weighed about 1801 b.
Four of these bins were
shipped in each cargo-vessel,
and the fruit reached Europe
almost entirely free from bruis-
ing, while fruit in standard
boxes is always bruised—some-
times as much as half the con-
tents being affected. Some
damage occurred through
stalk-punctures, which showed
that greater care was needed in
selecting, grading and filling,
There were some handling and
stowing difficulties, too, which
would have to be ironed-out.
This shipment was just one
step forward an important
one, of course in the Aus-
tralia-wide change to bulk-
handling of apples and pears
from tree to table. It isn’t uni-
versal or even common
amongst growers or packing-
sheds and there’s wide diversity
in the equipment being used;
but the main principle has been
established and enough has
been done to show that bulk
handling has many advantages
—not least it saves up to 6d.
a bushel on packing-costs,
Bulk-bins for conveying
fruit from tree to packing-shed
may vary to suit individual
requirements, such as long or
short hauls and traction-power
available. But the bins must be
strongly built, so they won’t
twist when raised, and also
smoothly lined. They should
last a long time, so, if you are
thinking of building some,
don’t be influenced by a saving
which may look considerable
but works-out at only a matter
of a few quid a year. Don’t
decide on a type or size of bin
in a hurry,-either. Experiment,
if you want to ; but when you
build your bins, build them
well and strong. Don’t
discard your picking - boxes
entirely. You may need them
if there’s a spell of wet weather
during picking. Fruit picked
into bulk-bins when it’s
showery takes too long to dry.

into it a little water from a
water-bag.
The rain-song became
merely the accompaniment of
his pantomime. With his body
he imitated the animals that
come to the rain—the kanga-
roo’s toe-pads represented by
extended finger - tips ; the
rounded hoof of the horse by
finger-tips touching palm, and
a pawing movement from
the elbow to show a strong
horse galloping. He left
the rain-stick in the sand
to use both hands flattened and
moving downwards to show the
long, steady hop of the kanga-
roo on his way to the water;
flapped his arms like wings to
enact the movements of the
eagle searching for a new-
dropped lamb. Then he imitated
the lamb’s bleat of terror, and
bellowed to show the bullock,
whose horns were indicated by
a forefinger erect on either side
of the head.
Pantomime and rain-song
ceased ; Mika poured all the
water from the bag as he
walked around the channel
accompanying the gurgling of
the water from the mouth of
the bag by mouth-noises imitat-
ing the frothing sound of a
swollen creek.
“Swish! shish! shish shish! ”
said Mika; then suddenly
stopped, looked up at the black
cloud, changed from a belly-
ing sail to a tent top covering
the sky, and announced that he
was “altogether finish.”
“What name that one ‘Wish!
shish! ’ when you go all about,
Mika?”
“This one! S’pose when cow
losem calf, cow been sing out
loud feller ‘Moo-o-o-o,’ then
calf been hearem that one calf,
been sing out little feller ‘Ma-a.’
Then cow been sing out two-
feller time ‘Moo-o-o-o’;
altogether then calf been
findem. This one water been
say little-feller ‘Whish! shish!
shish! shish!’ This one water
been little baby longa that one
cloud. That one mother cloud
been hearem say ‘Whish!
shish!’ Then cloud been sing
out loud-feller, Whish ! shish !
shish!’ Rain come down
findem little baby-water longa
sand. Thunder been father
longa water-bag ; thunder been
sendem down rain findem
water-bag; that one rain been
gin alonga that one thunder
altogether.”
As if to its cue the thunder
entered, roaring through the
tremendous eruption of the
cloud, tearing the blackness in
a thousand lightning rifts. Mika
took his present of tobacco as
an earnest of payment on
delivery of rain, and went back
to his wurlie and feeble fire on
the creek-bank. The night was
sultry as ever when Walter
Rossitter and the manager of
Sampson Hills went to bed.
A t midnight the cloud swelled
lower to the earth and
the earth seemed to rise gently
and warmly, yearning for its
weight and fruitfulness. Light-
ning crackled incessantly and
nearby, seeming to enter the
homestead at the keyholes and
the slits below the doors. Every
board and every piece of furni-
ture cracked at the almost im-
perceptible change of tempera-
ture. A sighing wind lifted a
loose sheet of galvanised-iron,
rattled it and sighed itself to
death among the drought-killed
trees. A lower wind arose,
lifted the dust upon a thous-
and acres, sifted it carefully,
and laid it down again. A
young dog that had never seen
rain awakened and howled his
fear of the unknown, followed
his tail around three times, lay
down again and whimpered.
A soft cool breath puffed
through the sultry darkness, the
sky filled with light for a
moment, the thunder dis-
charged all its guns at once ;
and out of all that clamor and
illumination came a,drop of
rain. The mountain had pro-
duced the mouse yet again.
The cool breath became a
draught, and every chair and
flooring-board creaked in
answer. The thunder was on
the wakeful white men’s
pillows, the lightning seemed
to enter their beds ; the one
open door became an oblong
of almost continuous light. A
wind came out of the south ;
the monsoon swooped out of
the north. The air became
strangely moist; a few rain-
drops fell upon the roof. Behind
it all they felt the rain coming
against the wind, and then,
with light and roaring, the rain
beat upon the house, in cas-
cades and douches, and made
mud of the dust.
Rossitter got up to close the
door against the rain.
“Beaten, by God!” he said.
“The drought’s beaten.”
In that divinely altered air
they slept like happy children
tired out with play.
CJix months later Walter Ros-
sitter rode from Kundi
Kundi to Sampson Hills. The
land was park, garden and
meadow ; the returned cattle,
almost too fat to move, stared
at him ; the breeders suckling
their calves in the knee-deep
grass ; corella and galah flash-
ing white wings and grey wings
against the sunlight; the flies
a horror, and all the world
forgetting that it had ever
known the condemmed cell.
He had given a donation to
the church of the Rev. Penny-
chook, who claimed the rain;
and tobacco to the . actors of
the Creek Theatre. And now
he met Mika, who held that
the promise of two tchillin for
a real old-man flood applied to
Rossitter as well as to the
manager of Sampson Hills.
“I been payem two other
feller,” said Rossitter, teasing
him. “Payem Misser Penny-
chook—he say he make rain.”
“That one dam’ ’toopid
feller,” replied Mika contemp-
tuously.
' “Then I payem all thaf
other feller singem rain-song
alonga Workia.”
“No good that one,” said
Mika. “/ been makem rain. I
wait plenty-feller day alonga
that one. Then I makem rain-
song that one night. By cripes,
when piccaninny daylight come,
close up flood I make ’em.”
“There is the two bob, Mika
—I think you make best
magic.”
“All right that one,” said
Mika —“l know when makem
rain.”
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(13/8/’59.)
Rainfall should vary from moderate to good in a large
part of Queensland during September, with the best rains
on the Darling Downs, Maranoa, and part of the Warrego.
However, the Central Coast, Peninsula, North-west and Far
West should be confined to light rain. General rains are
indicated in October, and a good season is likely in much
of the State.
N.S.W. should receive moderate to good rains in Sep-
tember, although part of the Riverina and Far West should
be confined to light rain. The best rains should be in the
Central West. Moderate to good rains should c'ontinue in
October, but heavy general rains and widespread flooding
may come in November.
Victoria should receive good general rains during Sep-
tember and October, with the heaviest rain and some flooding
in the Central division. Heavy general rains and widespread
flooding are likely in November.
The agricultural areas of South Australia should receive
good rains in September, although rainfall should be light
in the interior. Good general rains should be received in
October. *
The South-west agricultural areas of Western Aus-
tralia should receive moderate rains (below normal) during
September, although good rains should occur on the South
Coast, Eucla and in the South-east. Light, patchy rains are
indicated elsewhere in the State.

Fiction ran only a short head behind
poetry. Three years after Separation
the first Queensland novel appeared—
Colin Munro’s Fern Vale, or The
Queensland Squatter, an old three-
decker, formal in style, moral in tone,
one-sided in sympathy (pro-squatter),
with its setting on the Darling Downs.
It is, then, a regional novel, and this
type contains some of the best Queens-
land examples of fiction.
The tendency continued with “Steele
Rudd’s” novels (or collection of stories
and sketches of selection life), also set
on the Downs, distorted often and lack-
ing in nuance, but vital and humorous
and evocative of the time and place.
The female counterpart appeared in
the stories of Sumner Locke, set in
much the same area, and giving
harsher and less humorous pictures of
Mum Dawson instead of Dad Rudd.
The north was depicted this century
by Randolph Bedford in one of his
lighter novels, and also in Joan Cole-
brook’s long and serious evoca-
tion of the Atherton Tableland, The
Northerner. Dorothy Cottrell, in her
second volume, Earth Battle, painted
drought and fire in western areas. And
most delicate of them all, Margaret
Trist has written a classic of childhood
on the Downs — Morning in Queens-
land.
But the greatest of Queensland
regional novelists, Vance Palmer, has
not confined himself to any one area.
In his long writing life he has made
Queensland an accepted and acceptable
theme for fiction—the West, Mt. Isa,
the coast, Caloundra, Brisbane. Though
still immature, we are now less
embarrassed when we read a Queens-
land place-name in a Queensland novel
—and this is chiefly due to Palmer.
Two surprising facts in the litera-
ture of this State, so large in area and
so small in population, are the number
of good town novels and the fewness
of good western ones. Brunton
Stephens gave us A Hundred Pounds
in 1876, set in Brisbane; and last year
Thea Astley evoked Townsville in
Girl With a Monkey. In the ’eighties
Rosa Praed remembered in England
her Queensland girlhood and in
Policy and Passion pictured the politi-
cal and social life of the capital. John
David Hennessey, in an undeservedly
forgotten story, The Dis-Honourable,
set a murder mysteiy in Brisbane
during the great flood of ’93, and put
down what he saw in prose that is
still eminently readable. Louis Becke
etched Bowen in acid, Zora Cross used
Innisfail as the setting for mystery and
romance, and Edith McKay outlined
the social intrigues of Rockhampton.
There is even a novel with part of its
setting in Esk.
The contrast with novels of the out-
back is marked. Few except the pro-
fessed student would have heard in
recent years of James Edwards, or
F. A. Blackman, or Alexander Grant,
or Alfred Bell, or John Mackie, or
A. E. Yarra. And yet they all wrote
western novels that had a measure of
popularity in their time. Perhaps only
the novels of Herbert Macllwaine,
which use Queensland as the yardstick
to measure the toughness of the
imported jackeroo, and the nature
stories of Henry Lamond are likely to
survive. And only those of the latter
are popularly known today.
The nearest approach to outback
novels is found in the pioneering ones.
Brian Penton’s Land takers and Inheri-
tors, brutal, violent and fiercely alive,
are the best of these—and a very
effective best, be it said. Frank
Connolly also has given us a saga. But
these novels are set not far from the
coast. The only western or north-
western examples are the sophisticated
and cynical novels of Sarah Campion,
the Mo Burdekin series. If some
months in Queensland are long enough
to make her a Queensland writer, then
we may most warmly claim her. Those
months were certainly enough to give
her an extraordinary command of
atmosphere.
Ernestine Hill’s long story of
Flinders must be mentioned here, the
only literally historical novel which
Queensland has.
One theme that has not been much
exploited is racial relations. Queens-
land has seen more types of immi-
grants —in some bulk, and in settled
areas —than any other State. And yet
few have written of their sometimes
edgy relations with the native Queens-
landers. Eric Baume in Burnt Sugar
dealt with Italians on the northern
canefields; Jean Devanny with
kanakas in the ’nineties in the same
area and with Italians and other
nationalities at a later period; Eliza-
beth Webb, in Into the Morning, with
the problem of half-caste assimilation.
This last, where the author writes in
the first person, is a successful tour-
de-force.
An odd type of novel appeared in
the ’eighties and ’nineties—the reform
novel. It may not always be deliber-
ate, perhaps, but an intention is felt.
These novels are like some New South
Wales examples in the ’forties and
’fifties of last century, and like them
again they often contain startling minor
characters —oddities and grotesques
and figures of fun. Not one of the
writers is now remembered, but two
on the fringes of the group still have
their niches—J. H. Nicholson, with his
moral fable (Halek), and William
Lane, the Labor leader, with his
political tract (The Workingman’s
Paradise).
In the short-story there is one notable
figure—Vance Palmer—whose develop-
ment has blended the earlier type at
the turn of the century with the less
narrational type of today. The super-
natural motif, not very frequent in Aus-
tralian fiction, links Francis Adams and
Ernest Favenc. The others have their
chosen fields—R. S. Porteous, the
sea; J. E. Macdonell (in both the novel
and the short-story), the Navy;
Margaret Trist, childhood; David
Rowbotham, the sketch.

WINTER IDYLL
Green, the springing calls and yields of
grass
where the poised trees ripple ferns around
their feet
and area their dark about them like
a call of mossy-breasted timber birds !
The winter warmth of sun hues green
more green
and blithely heaps today with colors’ fill
to celebrate fern, grass and tree and hill.
Green children with their moist and
dipping cries
are far away, are near, tumbling Today
between the scattered picnic-grounds of
trees.
All winter glitters where their voices are,
and a colder season may not come at all —
this climate dreams the final weather mild
along the sturdy shadows of each child.
Whole continents of clouds, vast as green
days,
move their huge lifetimes soundlessly and
quick
above, and their distresses make no mark
at all except to please the valleys with
their dying shade and pattern on the
range.
Lazy as clouds we watch them idle by,
dazzled in the infinities of sky.
And you and l come for a picnic here
to smile with all the green heights of the
world.
This land is lovely as it always was,
though in my eyes it spins sharper and
thick
because, today, l marry it with you.
You are my lens to understand the rise
and crest of time caught here. You have
my eyes:
and children running green upon the
slope
may learn the subtle change that country
makes
along the seasonal climates of my eyes.
Surely winter has only crispness here,
to pinch the bright-edged branches sharp
as flints,
and reassure the dying clouds above,
and teach me such new clarities of love.

Biographical details about an
artist named Tom Midwood, said
to be Tasmania’s first caricaturist ?
Born at Hobart in 1855, he went
to sea, and for a time toured with
a musical company in the U.S.
He was a skilful player of the banjo,
the guitar and the mandolin, and
contributed to the “British Musical
Gazette” and the American journal
“Cadenza.” Returning to Hobart,
he was employed in the drafting
department of the Public Works
Office, and while so engaged con-
tributed caricatures to the “Tas-

Who wrote the words of “The
Skye Boat Song”? Was it Steven-
son ?
No. The words of “The Skye
Boat Song” (which begins “Speed,
bonnie boat, like a bird on the
wing”) were written by Sir Harold
Boulton (1859-1935). The Oxford
Companion to Music says, “One
half of the tune is a sea-chanty
heard in 1879 by Miss Annie
MacLeod (later Lady Wilson) when
going by boat from Toran to Loch
Coruisk; the other half is by Miss
MacLeod herself. The words, by
Sir Harold Boulton, date from
1884. Later some other words
were written to the tune by Robert
Louis Stevenson, who apparently
believed the tune to be a pure
folk-tune and in the public
domain.” Stevenson's poem is
called “Over the Sea to Skye.”

CENTENARY SPIRITS
N.F.: Sing on: —
A CENTENARY CALL TO
QUEENSLANDERS.
Come on let’s honor our Queensland,
One hundred old, so let us be gay>
Queen Victoria’s defence, and favor doth
stand,
Rule Brittania for ever in this sunny
land.
To Princess Alex we call, in the name
of our Queen,
Our gracious young Queen of today.
The emphasis, is on youth they say;
The setting, is happy, and gay,
May we invite her to dance, to play,
and be gay.
To enjoy our sport, in our young peoples
way,
We want our potential to be under-
stood,
In mining, in pastoral, and farming so
fine,
Our industrial development, and scenic
coast-line,
Our academic training, and sport is sub-
lime.
Our Governors, and Parliaments work
in unison well,
With unsurpassable zeal, their attain-
ments to swell,
Let our hearts swell in fullness, our
voices to raise,
In a crescendo of pride, and a paean
of praise,
To the honor of our Royalty, our Nation,
our God.
Tanda: You’re away:
YEPPOON.
In all of Sunny Queensland
Yeppoon would be hard to beat
Down on her glorious beaches
Many old friends meet
All along the esplanade
Are lots of nice pine trees
People sit upon the seats
To enjoy the ocean breeze.
They flock down from Rockhampton
They come from far outback
Months ahead all accommodation is
taken
For each year they all come back.
M.J.: Here you go:
COME TO CAIRNS.
The city of Cairns is well renowned
And proud of it too—rightly so,
For there is beauty here to be found
Where tropical fruits thrive and grow.
First there’s Green Island out in the
sea,
A gem in a setting of blue,
World-famous for it’s Observatory
And it’s fish and it’s coral too.
Lake Placid is not too far out of town,
And here you can swim and ski,
Admire the animals, furry and brown
All stuffed so beautifully.
....H.T.: Nothing fresh in it.

OUTBACK SONGS
T>eleased by Wattle Record-
ings, Across the Western
Plains, a selection of Austra-
lian folksongs collected and
sung by A. L. Lloyd, hits you
initially with the force of a
pickaxe, mainly because the
singing lacks popular concert-
hall refinement.
The record, in fact, raises
an interesting question. In the
accompanying comprehensive
booklet which so neatly prints
the words of all 12 songs and
explains such vagaries as
“blue-bellied yeo,” “grafting
humor” and whatnot, Lloyd is
said to be singing these songs
as he heard them sung by his
workmates in the bush. Nine
years a stationhand, he had
plenty of time to observe the
proper way to render bush-
ballads: proper, that is, in
terms of traditional usage.
Therefore he inclines to “the
traditional bush style: un-
accompanied, slow, with the
voice pitched high and rather
nasal.” Lloyd’s major varia-
tion on the dictum is that he
uses accompaniment: banjo,
guitar, mandolin and mouth-
organ.
In listening to the record
this background must be kept
in mind. Lloyd isn’t a Clauson
or an Ives, and doesn’t pretend
to be —just as well, too,
because one could never
imagine a shearer bringing-off
Ives’s honeyed articulation.
Probably, if he attempted it,
he’d be howled down. . This
is the difference: Lloyd is
authentically representative.
They say the truth hurts, and
there’s something in it, too,
when your ideas about the
singing of Australian bush-
songs are so expertly shat-
tered.
An honest approach to
Lloyd’s singing—and it may
take a couple of hours’ listen-
ing—should convince anybody
that, notwithstanding occa-
sional roughnesses, particularly
where Lloyd is preoccupied
with the juicier parts of the
text, the style is most pleas-
antly “outback.” You couldn’t
ask for more than that. It is
Australian, and richly Austra-
lian, too.
The songs range from “Click
Go the Shears” (eight verses ;
the tune is slightly different to
the one most people are
familiar with), to the title-
tune, “Across the Western
Plains”:
All for my grog, my jolly, jolly
grog,
All for my beer and tobacco;
Well, I spent all my tin in the
shanty drinking gin,
Now across the western plains I
must wander.
And so it goes, in the same
vein, for another six stanzas.
Most of these songs —but not
all—are swingy ; “The Lachlan
Tigers,” for instance, a hearty
shearing-song, and the “Wild
Rover” song, nearly approach-
ing a waltz in its vigor and
repetitive refrain. The pick
of the jolly ones maybe
the pick of the whole l lot —is
“South Australia,” a pure
chanty in which Lloyd is
periodically joined by one or
two other singers:
In South Australia I was born,
Well, heave away, oh, haul away;
In South Australia round Cape
Horn,
We’re bound for South Australia.
Actually, the words “heave”
and “haul” should be printed
in italics, since Lloyd and the
singers lean on them ; and in
this song you’d swear Lloyd is
smiling all the way through.
By contrast, “The Mary-
borough Miner,” set in a
minor key, is full of iron
shadows ; and “One of the
Has-beens” is, in its melan-
choly way, nicely melodic,
and it’s interesting to hear
Lloyd using the Catholic
plainsong liquescent effect of
“singing” consonants.
Lloyd is backed by Peggy
Seeger (banjo and guitar),
Ralph Rinzler (mandolin) and
John Cole (mouth-organ). At
all times they form an excel-
lent and subdued backdrop to
Lloyd’s presentation. But
surely, if we are going to
have authentic bush-style sing-
ing, we ought also to have a
similar type of musical accom-
paniment—something, perhaps,
a little more casual than such
neatly tailored playing? This
is, of course, a small point;
and Lloyd can be recom-
mended to anyone prepared to
forget preconceived or Ameri-
canised ideas about the singing
of Australian songs.

For Two Generations
A problem when choosing
popular recordings for the
family record-player is the
difficulty of pleasing two
generations with one disk. It’s
not insoluble, of course. It
should be possible to produce
a platter that will tickle the
teenagers without driving the
old man out of the house to
seek the comparative peace of
the corner pub. Similarly,
there must be recordings
which can give pleasure to the
oldsters.
From Coronet come two
such records, one in each cate-
gory. “Saturday Night Mood”
(KLP 749) delivers a dozen
foxtrots by as many top-line
dance-bands.
Singers, not dance-bands,
dig the microgrooves on
KLP 788 “The Four Lads
Swing Along.” A baritone, two
tenors and a bass, the four
swing the old oaken bucket
cornin’ through the Rye, plead
to be allowed to call you sweet-
heart, wind-up Grandfather’s
clock on the Swannee River
and Moonlight Bay—and much
more of the same.


Women's Letters
MELBOURNE
In introducing Mrs. Graham Hall (wife
of the U.S. Consul-General), who opened
the Embroideries of All Nations Exhibi-
tion at the University’s Beaurepaire
Centre, Mrs. Tristan Buesst, who was one
of the convenors, remarked jocularly that
it might be a good thing if delegates to
the U.N. Assembly took along a piece of
needlework, had a natter and swapped
stitches. In brief speeches Lady Paton,
Lady Amies, Mrs. Buesst and Mrs. Hall
made appeals for funds for the University.
The needlework shown was of rare beauty
and design. An especially fine example
of the art was the framed pole-screen of
floral design worked by Mrs. W. E.
Sturrock, a pupil at the Royal College of
Needlework. Among those who admired
the exhibits were the Premier’s wife, Mrs.
H. E. Bolte ; Mrs. Arthur Dean, wife of
the University’s Chancellor ; Lady Mur-
doch, Mrs. E. K. Smart, Mrs. H. G.
Connell, Mrs. L. Voumard and Mrs.
Dick Noone.

As light as a spring zephyr are the
exquisite laces and ribbons, tiny sleeves
and nylons seen in the new Kayser
collection of lingerie. The tailored lines
of former seasons have been replaced
by the high Empire-line bodice in night-
gowns and slips, while the bouffant lace
petticoat has come, to the fore—all very
feminine and captivating. A new, dull
opaque-nylon is used for the entire range,
and with great charm in elegant, full-
length nightgowns, trousseau-wear, slips
and pantees. The newest color is brandy-
crusta, a pale-brandy with a touch of
cream undertone. There were two out-
standing petticoats shown: one, made
from yards of Alencon-lace, will billow
the widest skirt to perfection ; the other,
featuring three widespread flounces of
permanently pleated and embroidered
nylon, is designed to wear under the bell-
shaped skirt which will be a feature of
spring fashions. Both petticoats, are worn
with corded, stiffened-nylon marquisette
underskirts.
Another fabric which delighted those
at this showing was shadow-batiste, a
high-quality cotton on which the barest
outline of a flower is printed. This was
used to make a graceful gown and
“brunch”-coat. The calf-length gown
had a lovely Empire-line bodice with
slotted-ribbon finishing in a bow under
the bustline and a full, flared skirt. The
matching coat had a deep portrait-
neckline threaded with nylon ribbon,
which fell in a graceful back-bow. This
set was in a pale lilac, the batiste being
drip-dry. Other attractive nightgowns
included one which featured a print of
sprigs of cherry-blossom scattered over
a white drip-dry lawn; a waltz-length
white nightgown patterned in bluebirds
had a matching coat with a Peter Pan
collar, full puff-sleeves and full skirt.
Guests at the buffet-luncheon arranged
by the president (Mrs. J. A. Seitz) and
committee of management of the
Yooralla Hospital School for Crippled
Children, enjoyed their drinks in the
sun-drenched garden before going inside.
Early spring-blossom and red and pink
camellias decorated the large reception-
rooms. Mrs. Henry Bolte, who was
president of the ladies’-committee during
the recent appeal for funds, was wel-
comed home from her overseas tour by
Mrs. Seitz, who was assisted by vice-
president Mrs. A. E. Roberts, hon.
secretary Mrs. Douglas Ewan and hon.
treasurer Mrs. Ken Adamson. Among
the guests were Lady Warner, Lady
Richardson, Mrs. L. J. Dooling, Lady
Selleck, Mrs. Vernon Peck, Dame Mary
Daly, Mrs. W. K. Burnside, Mrs. W. H.
Sloane, Mrs. Arthur Kaines, Mrs.
Maurice Ashkanasy, Mrs T. G. Pizzey
and Mrs. Leo Curtis. After the luncheon
guests were shown over Yooralla, and
also were entertained at an impromptu
concert put on by a group of the children.
Dr. Sylvia Lourie, whose own flawless
skin is proof of her contention that scien-
tific skin-care combined with simple
exercises can do much to assist the skin
of women of middle-age, is a beauty-
doctor who spends most of her time
between the U.S. and Paris, where she
has her home. Born in Belgium, Dr.
Lourie did her medical course at Cam-
bridge and practical work at the London
School of Medicine for Women and St.
Mary’s Hospital. She also has degrees
from the University of Brussels. She
describes herself as a “flying ambassa-
dress” for a well-known beauty-firm
which has branches in every part of the
world.

The Junior Australian-American Asso-
ciation, whose president is Andre Papp,
held its first ball, “Southern Fiesta,” in
the Royale Ballroom, and so original,
gay and colorful were decorations that
the committee has been asked to allow
them to be used for the reception to
Princess Alexandra, to be given by the
Government on Sept. 17. A giant Mexi-
can greeted guests as they arrived.
Doorways were hung with brightly
colored ribbons, and the ceiling of the
ballroom was a mass of bright-green
balloons. On each pillar was a large
sequin-decorated moustachioed Mexican
figure wearing a brightly colored Mexican
serape. On each table were sequin-
trimmed green wooden cacti, and
numbers were marked on tiny yellow-
and-black Mexican hats. The official
guests sat at a table covered with pleated
orange taffeta, and at each end were tall
black candelabra tied with orange-and-
yellow streamers. The decorations were
the work of a sub-committee headed by
Bruce Robinson and consisting of lan
Evans, Jan Newman, Judy Gundill and
ball - committee president Barbara
Zinnow.
Guests included U.S. Consul-General
Graham Hall and Mrs. Hall (she wearing
a gown of soft grey French-embroidered
lace) ; Dr. W. Braun, U.S. Information-
officer ; Mrs. T. Spensley; Mrs. M.
Hamilton (her husband represented the
senior association) ; Anne Curtis (charm-
ing in a white sheath-gown covered with
silver beads and drop-pearls). Visiting
Americans Marguerite West and Ben-
jamin J. Rice, here under the A.-A.A.’s
Pacific - neighbors’ programme, were
guests-of-honor, Marguerite wearing a
full-skirted aqua taffeta gown sewn with
sequins, which had been lent to her by
Mrs. Hall —her own dresses were still
stranded at the airport.
Among the dancers were Wendy
Milner, wearing a red-and-white-
patterned polished-cotton ; Robin Milner,


who chose a short white-brocade sheath-
frock ; Fran Gillison, wearing a short,
full-skirted frock of bronze taffeta ;
Amanda Larritt, in black-and-gold shot-
taffeta which had a strapless beaded
bodice ; Morva Bennett (it was she who
made the amusing horses used in the
mock-bullfight seen during the evening)
chose a full-length white-satin gown with
a green floral-satin drape at the back.
Proceeds of the ball will go to the 1960
Pacific-neighbors’ fund.

News has come from London of the
engagement of Marjorie, younger
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. A. H. Cotter,
of Double Bay (formerly of Warrambah,
Cunnamulla, Queensland), to Neville
Salisbury, younger son of Captain and
Mrs. A. W. Salisbury, of Bellevue Hill.
The young couple are both holidaying
overseas ; Neville expects to return home
in September, and his fiancee is plan-

on a tour of the U.S. before they, too,
return to Australia at the end of the year.

A whirlwind romance which began at
Mt. Kosciusko a few weeks earlier cul-
minated in the wedding at St. Benedict’s
Church, Broadway, of Dr. Caroline
Nihill, only daughter of the late Dr.
and Mrs. R. Nihill, and Lieut. Robert
Simmonds, R.A.N. Later the couple left
by plane for Fremantle to board
Oronsay on the first stage of their
journey to Lossiemouth, Scotland, where
Lieut. Simmonds will be attached to the
Royal Navy and study jet-flying for
about three years. The bride wore a
very lovely gown, the nylon bodice
appliqued with guipure-lace, and out-
lined with white beads, the bouffant
skirt of tulle. She carried a prayer-book
with trails of white hyacinth. Her brides-
maids were Marilyn Jones and Suzanne
Simmonds. The bridegroom’s mother,
Mrs. W. Simmonds, and his sister,
Suzanne, flew from Perth for the
wedding.

There’s something about the bagpipes
—and their kilted players—that brings
a tingle of excitement, even to those with-
out a drop o’ the Scottish in their veins.
This was most obvious at the ball
held at the Trocadero to aid funds
of the Cancer and Surgical Research
Appeal, when four stalwart kilt-clad
members of the Highland Society Pipe
Band led the official party into the ball-
room with a spirited skirl o’ pipes.
Among guests who were welcomed by
Mrs. J. E. Cassidy were Sir William and
Lady McKell (her full-length gown was
of olive-green silk, worn with a silk stole
of a paler shade), and Alderman A. C.
Molloy, Mayor of Randwick, and chair-
man of the appeal. Mrs. Cassidy’s oyster-
grey satin dress was full-length, while
Mrs. Cooper (her husband is president of
Randwick Rotary Club, whose members
are working hard for the appeal) was in
pale-blue brocaded-satin, embossed with
silver, and made with panniers looped
over a satin underskirt of midnight-blue.
The aquamarine silk-brocade ballerina
worn by Mrs. Doyle was made in the
Empire-line and ruched from neck to
hem of the bouffant skirt. Mrs. R. F.
Kaye-Webster looked charming in
amethyst satin, rhinestone-embroidered.

Per Volume
the literary scene the most famous is
A. G. Stephens, bom in Toowoomba,
the formidable Red Page arbiter. Nor
should H. A. Kellow be forgotten. His
Queensland Poets is likely to remain
the best account we shall have of those
writing before 1930.
A few conclusions, perhaps not too
facile, may be drawn. One is that the
number of good writers is obviously
not large. Vance Palmer, Judith
Wright, Brunton Stephens, Essex
Evans, A. G. Stephens, Steele Rudd—
these are known to any secondary-
schoolboy. But after these one uneasily
wonders if only the professional critic
is concerned.
Another point is that, if we put
Judith Wright aside, Queensland
literature, unlike the national product,
is stronger in prose than in verse. Yet
even here it may be claimed that
Queensland minor poets, though with-
out distinction, are often distinctive—
they do speak with their own recog-
nisable voices.
Last, Queensland is still immature
in literary matters. Very few of its
novels are wholly adult: most deal with
things rather than with people (though
something of the same charge can be
levelled against Australian fiction).
And there are no literary periodicals.
“Meanjin” started here, it is true, and
“Barjai” survived a few years; but
there is nothing like them now. Nor
can the literary pages of its news-
papers bear any comparison with those
of the great southern dailies. We can
only hope that these things lie not so
far ahead.

The god who dreamed here grew aware,
So strode, an angry Gulliver,
Over the Lilliputian hill
And broke the dream beneath his heel.
A vision in the end he found
Is tiny as the dreaming-ground
When all else sees with smallest sense,
Swaddled in indifference . . .
The great gods leave the place untaught
That snores upon a little thought.

NEW QUEENSLAND BOOKS
Two good novels. Margaret Trist’s
Morning in Queensland and Henry G.
Lamond’s Sheep Station, have made a
timely appearance in Queensland’s
centenary year; and here are a few
documentary books, some directly
relating to the centenary, that are
helping to celebrate the occasion.
If it is only a coincidence that
brings H. Oakman’s Gardening in
Queensland (Jacaranda Press) out at
this time, it is a happy coincidence,
for, with the Cooktown Orchid flower-
ing on the dust jacket, it is an excellent
book of its kind.
Surprisingly and most interestingly
to a mere southerner, Oakman says
that gardening in Queensland is diffi-
cult. Of course it would be in the arid
inland where this reviewer once saw
a garden consisting entirely of fossils;
but even in the lush, tropical parts,
you do not just put things in the
ground and watch them burgeon. You
put them in the ground and they fall
over with wilt and fungus-diseases.
Oakman is, indeed, quite moving on
the subject:—
There is an innate desire in almost
all gardeners to gather into their
gardens as many exotic plants as
they can collect. Thousands of
Poincianas have died a lingering
death in Melbourne gardens, and in
Queensland there are thousands of
Camellias, Rhododendrons, Daffo-
dils and Tulips slowly tortured out
of existence because gardeners insist
on verifying for themselves the
well-known fact that these plants
simply will not grow here....
Annuals such as Larkspur, An-
tirrhinum, Dianthus, Aster, Lobelia
and Nemesia are most uncertain. . ..

cannot be used except on the table-
lands. Many standard garden plants,
of which roses are probably the
most popular, will grow in Queens-
land, but will never attain the per-
fection of those grown in temperate
regions.
It is, then, though this includes a
chapter on roses, only “plants that
have succeeded in Queensland condi-
tions” with which Oakman concerns
himself; and this, limited though the
field may be, nevertheless gives him a
book of 306 pages . . . where, the
southern gardener as well as the
Queenslander will be relieved to note,
if most of it deals with such tropical
items as the pineapple and the pome-
granate, the strelitizia and the cunjevoi-
lily, there is still a place for the azalea
and even the familiar chrysanthemum.
Mr. Oakman has managed the Parks
Department of the Brisbane City
Council for the last eleven years.
Buildings of Queensland (Jacaranda),
published by the State Chapter of the
Royal Institute of Architects and
apparently written by various hands,
is, of course, a publication especially
for the centenary. With the foreword
pretentiously set-out as if it were free-
verse, some of the text in the style of
film-titles and an occasional caption
missing from the illustrations (at least
in the drawing of “The First House in
Brisbane”), the book has some faults
in presentation; and, at the end, where
there is a list of firms connected with
the building industry, it gets a bit
commercial.
Nevertheless, it is full of informative
and often charming photographs of
Queensland architecture from the
earliest times to the the present; and,
taking in everything from the big
modern schools and hospitals to the
Toowoomba public lavatory and
(designed by none other than Walter
Burley Griffin) the Ipswich incinerator,
it is certainly comprehensive. One of
its most interesting points is an
account of the houses on stilts (the
“stump base”) which are such a
striking feature of Queensland archi-
tecture—the editors say the style is
“almost unique to Queensland” but
are unable to find much evidence about
its origins.
Queensland, Daughter of the Sun
(Jacaranda), edited by Clem Lack, is
the official book of the centenary, and,
handsomely illustrated with color-
plates of fish, scenery and bathing-
beauties, and fully surveying all aspects
of Queensland life, does the job
admirably.
Considering how much of it is neces-
sarily official hand-out stuff, facts,
statistics and industrial surveys of
interest to overseas readers but lack-
ing the freedom that makes the best
reading, it is remarkable how much of
it does come to life; and the reason
for that, apart from the enthusiasm of
some of the writers, is simply that
Queensland life has always been full of
color and adventure. So, interspersed
with the statistics, there are the trees,
the animals, the fish, the goldfields and,
particularly, those two outstanding
adventurers of the early days. Went-
worth Darcy Uhr and Christy Palmer-
ston: —
Darcy Uhr was more than a match
for these tough characters. His
favorite weapon was the stockwhip,
which he used with the flashing
rapidity of a rapier in the hands of a
skilled swordsman. In 1872, when
he was only 23, Uhr overlanded
the first beef-cattle from Queens-
land to the Northern Territory.
Christy Palmerston, a lean, wiry
man of comparatively small stature,
was the Queensland counterpart of
Rider Haggard’s famous small-boned
hero, Alan Quartermaine. Attended
by a retinue of devoted black
retainers, Palmerston was the prince
of pathfinders.
Queensland literature is covered by
A. K. Thomson; and, in an article on
Queensland art, C. M. B. van Homrigh
shows that the State has produced
many more distinguished Australian
painters than most people would
realise: Hilder and Lloyd Rees are
two resounding names to begin with.
Music is also covered; and here,
amongst others, we meet Gladys Mon-
crieff as “the Bundaberg girl.”

Aeration, settling, sludge re-circulation, digestion by “ wet-burning ” and chlorination results in a clear,
sparkling effluent with loW) 8.0. D.
“Wet-burning” of the sludge by oxidation produces a fine ash which is transferred in small quantities to
the chlorine contact zone without materially increasing the 8.0. D. or degree of purity of the final effluent.
Sludge disposal problems are therefore completely eliminated.
