The Red Page
Second-h$nd Bookshops
As a child I had a passion for dark
and forbidding places—old v driVes, lnus#
tunnels and dim retreats under houses. A”
lollyshop in the basement of an old
stone building fascinated me, This 6dcJ'
emporium of sv«£efs' wd% kept by ft hump-,
backed dame with one tkjUk eye arid one
light-colored eyqVwhich whs always wide,
round and staring, even wlh;n slic slept among
the flies behind her/ dingy counter. ‘That
might easily have >the. least salubftlous
storehouse for .the whole State /
but this did not occur to-ihe as. a sound ex-
cuse for foregoing, the exceptionally- delicious
“taffy” retailed by-old mother Tandy. Apart
from the fact that bnje ’could purchase such*
stick-jaw in the dingy, cobwebbed den of
Mrs. Tandy as was equalled by few and ex-
celled‘by/hohe, the surroundings and situa-
tion of the shop lent to the purchasing of
every pen’orth of almond-rock a taste, of
adventure * and a touch of mystery. Nor
was I alope in my preference for the black
shop and the eerie witch. A glaring new
establishment up the street spread its im-
maculate perfections in vain to wean my
schoolmate*; from the dismal den. *
So to-dfty I pass 'by the spick-and-span
bookshops -in the city With hardly a glance,
whereas a- tumble of tattered volumefc
marked “This Lot 3d.” in a broken basket
outside a smoke-stained, ; dust-laden, mart for
the sale ,of hand-me-down literary wares will
pull tm* up’short, and keep me foraging for
half-an-hour. I cannot say I eVer know
what it ip I am looking for, haying no ex-
cuse; for piy folly as confirmed collectors,
have. 1 should not know rare old editions
if I rftn aerbss them, and rare old editions
no more concern me than bad old hats. No,
I am ndt; seeking sudden unearned increment
in Blanks basket of printers’ junk, and if
I bring to light a swollen Bernard Shaw
that I have not yet yead, or a battered
Wells that is still nfew to' me, I am well
.satisfied., A copy of Charles Whibley’s “The
Pageantry of Life,” comparatively whole
’'and not disreputable beyond restoration, I
considered a, rich reward after an hour’s
seeking for whatever turn up. Yet
.that hour, devoted to the making of casual
verse bud vagabond paragraphs, might have
earned me the wherewithal to purchase two
'or three 'Wiublcys, brand-new and ; quite
savory i .s*4 that 1 have ijo really sound,
rational, excuse for my explorations in these
dusty literary byways, 'lt is a fad , that I
cannot be rid of, a hobby that' rides me.
There ■ ar£,> I am aware, many well-
ordered ftbd wholly irreproachable second-
hand bookshops/but they- have no apnea 1 for
jme, I pass them with scarcely more than;
a cursory /glance, whereas few engagements
are so .pressing that they do not leave me,
time for a-fairly /comprehensive inspectioij of
the windoiv of a tumble-down, true-to-type
estabti.slitfteiit, a welter rtf printed scrap, dis-
gorging ;ii% ebnteuts on'to the sidewalk, and
spilling 'Books ail mvr the place. The men
who keep ‘these' disreputable places have no-
thing in ; bomnion w'tyli the prini. precise
chaps, wKb flutter ahput you so nervously in
a first-liatid: 'establishment, flapping helpless
palms .'.and .beseeching to be told what it is
you warn, aS’if'a book-hunter wen 1 a reason-
able befug'aud might be expected to know
what he Avants--whf.il 'lie ventures into the
presence rtf a great collect ion.'
Your ; properly-constituted second-hand
bookseller is a dusty man in dusty clothes,
with bis hair fiiirof'the fine flour paper gives
off, and always with ' a smear on his cheek.
He lives 41one behind 'his shop, as a spider is
at home in some dim fastness at the back of
its web, but ‘ with no ulterior intention, as
the spider has. lie does not even urge you
to buy.' You may do so if yon please, or
you may leave with him the treasures he has
acquired at such expense and with the ex-
penditure 0f.,50 much labor. You may maul
his stock about according to your whim, and
without dear :of increasing the magnificent
disorder. , Here is Bohemia’s last foothold
in the literary world. ; '
’l’lie .second-hand bookseller who knows his-
business is u‘silent man without, kith or kin.
I know one with three rooms of an ordinary
cottage littered with stock, and the fourth
and final, room gradually being over-run, who
spends his time reading at a little dirty.desk
under a cobwebbed window, and blinks over
his cold pipe at you when you enter, and
says: “TSne.,price is, on ’em. Stick the money
in the bowl.”, The receptacle, for cash is. an
ordinary* pudding-basiff on the. counter, and
be trusts you to take your own change. But
if yotl be can be won from his taci-
turnity, and, pressed, he will discover for
you neviy, truths in jVla.nc .Corel ti, or great
and unsuspected depths in Hall Caine; or he
may be mote abstruse, and quote Plato
darkly.' -They are very partial to Plato.
I thipk there should he discoverers’ rights
in old and out-of-the-way bookstalls'. When
I have unearthed: such: a one I keejily resent
intrusion 1 by arty other literary fossicker, and
one of iffy most cherished animosities is for
an elderly writer who lias three times broken
in on among” the nibble of
dilapidated bookshops X have 'found after
ardiunis : explorations 6f the byways.; Such
a thing might conceivablyihappeiv once, twice
it would bb ail extraordiutfry coincidence, but
threq topics iiiipUes premeditation. One
wonderful- old . literary jumble-sale I dis-
covered in-an ont-of-f lie-way street in one of
the AqUfihefn stiburbk: and there-/on my
second’yffsit I came upon this hitherto biglily-
estim-atell poet up'to his neck pi the time-
worn hbpks, as grimy. ;as a dustrtian. apd
burrowing like a ferret'. I had mentioned
the existence of the shop *td him in confidence,
believing him hpiiopabl.e. Never in my life
did 1 c'cmie so uear frt openly cursing a, poet.
There A ,is a sum lb overcrowded shop in-
one of- tiff; narrow side' streets of the city that
I favored fft (>pc time. It bad all
the singularity o£.tlie lollySlmp of m.v remote',
youth. It' was parity,. underground i you

stood aside and let you wallow unquestioned.
The six-feet-by-three of window that stood
up above the pavement was loaded with
books, as mercers sometimes tumble\ni their
last shipment of cheap shirts. Inside the
place bulged with books, they leaned from
tire, shelves, they were,, piled opHop, Tufchifig v
ontirio-usly. They were loaded on the flo'or,
on file counter, and urith-g" it. The pro.prie-
.tor, I am sure, begrudged the little'space he
had to leavev for 1 customers. On-, (the occa-
sion’’of toy last visit I found the door closed,
arid a small, curious crowd bringing about the
frqnt. My old furry bookseller was dead.

EDWARD DYSON.
A Tasmanian Singer
Of all who sang the lights find shadows of
the great war none struck a truer note than
H. W. Stewart in his “Challenge of the
Guns” i; —
But*, above the bushland music, 'beating, beating from
afar,’
I. can hear the deeper throbbing of the trumpet
■ voice of, war— .
And the burden of it runs,. in the challenge of the
guns—
“ Send your nearest, send., your dearest! Send your
sons, send your sons!” .
Say the rumbling, grumbling guns, “Send your sons,
send'ypur sons!”
That is an unusual strain for this poet who
sees life with very gentle eyes; but through
the whole of liis book, Rhymes arid Rambling s
'( Alexander McCubbin, Meib.), there are sud-
den surprises, swift turns, of fancy and
thoughts that show a wide range of imagina-
tion and sympathy. Here is a sonnet in
which Stewart, shows both the quality of liis
mind and the touch of the craftsman
Prom My Balcony...
A goldfinch, from the new-leaved pear-tree sings
A hymn of ecstasy, A brown 'bee goes ■ „ ,
By, droning wonder kt such fiectar. flo\\S, ' ,
Cold spangled with the pollen each bloom spills.
And when, my being with this sweetness fills . ,
I lift eyes sated with a flaming rose . -V"
To where blue Barrow crowns' with gleaming; snows-
The purple panorama of far hills. ' -
Then such a subtle gladness floods my soul— ' ,
Forg-otten the grey-spectres of regret,
The broken, dreams, the grinning ghosts of pain,
And quests forlorn that failed to reach a goal—,
Yea,, tor a fleeting moment -1. forget -
The ruins of fair c-astles in. old Spain. , , . ';
There is a note at the beginning of the hook
which mentions that the matter is not
arranged in the author’s order; and it is
more than probable that some cruder hand
has touched the ■ punctuation of this sonnet.
The last word of the first line should cer-
tainly. be “trills,” not “sings.,” Shell, mis-
takes are a pity, for they force upon 'the
reader the fact that the author is an invalid,
scarcely able. to stir • a finger, and much at
the mercy of others. In view of these cir-
cumstances —they are all set out with cheer-
fulness in the article called “Rheumatism,”
for the book is a mixture of verse, and prose
—the simple lines take on a triumphant note,
for all their melancholy interest:. But it is
a singing quality that gives - distinction to
the work. Take a few lines chosen almost
at random:—; , ■ ,
The night is kind 'to broken roofs and men.
.II is winding sheet’ the all-compassionate snow.
Melodious silence L the speech of souls.
‘Moonlight auld magpies singing in the trees.
The bees’ fldwer-hatrvest 'ripe with honeyed sheaves.
All tire" verse in the book is not of equal
quality;; bfit all shows the same spirit, the
same feeling after the high afid gracious
things of life.- ’■

The Laughter of a Friend
Everyone whrf has read “The Silence of
Colonel Bramble,” by Andre Maurois, will
want to buy his General Bramble (John
Lane). Anyone who hasn’t is hereby urged
to .correct the deficiency. Two more amus-
ing boohs were never written about, a war.
In this volume Bramble has a Division —the
Scottish Division. Maurois, as in.his first
book, presents a series of episodes,
and (be more preposterous one of them may
appear to the civilian mind, the more clearly
and accurately it is liable to reflect a, type
of military mind which is evidently cosmo-
politan. There was the case of the French
dugout, Major Baraquin, whose grand-
father had fought at Waterloo. but
who looked old enough to have been there
himself. He maddened Colonel Parker by
roaring “No, no, no,’* to every request, usu-
ally without waiting to hear the finish of
it. As against Baraquin there was Lieu-
tenant Barefoot, the elderly, efficient, hard-
working English business-man who had
every quality requisite for success as an
A.S.C. officer but the military poise. It
came to a question bf distributing rewards-:
“What about Barefoot?” said Auvelle. “Couldn’t
he be made a captain?” <
“Barefoot-! That damned shopkeeper OTlow?
The man who 'wanted to introduce his methods into
the arlpy! He’s a public danger, my boy; But
I can propose vour friend Major Baraquin for a
C.M.C., if you like.” \
“Baraquin! Why, he always refused everything'
you asked him for.” 1
V “Yes,” said the Colonel; “lie’s not very easy to
get on with ; he doesn’t uud'erst'and things ; but he’s
a soldier every' inch of him. I like old, Baraquin, ’’ _
As the bpolc deals throughont with a Divi-
sional lI.Q. there is a good deal in it about
the .distribution of decorations; and there
is one delightfully-told and perfectly cred-
ible yarn of three officers in an' B.F.A.
battery who attract Division’s angry atten-
tion 'through refusing inoculation, and by
a ,m,ix-up in the nominal rolls ai-e all made
Knights of the Legion, of Honor. Tjiis epi-
sode |s preceded by the following ' .

The reproducing powers of the “New
Edison” are by no means limited to its
own perfect “Re-Creations”; any other
type of reproducer may be fitted to it,
enabling its owner to play all types of
Records.
But the “New Edison” Diamond Repro-
ducer cannot be fitted to an ordinary
talking-machine, nor can the* “Re-
creations” be successfully played on a
needle instrument.
For these reasons your Christmas choice should be
The “NEW EDISON” —all phonographs in one.
You should write for an interesting booklet dealing with the
marvellous tone tests to which the “New Edison” has been
subjected—free on request to Thomas A. Edison, Ltd.,

VARIOVS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Naisi to Deirdre.
In the grand aristocracy of truth
This crested word of mine
Is written clear as men read God’s own
youth
In the new-budded vine:
I love you with a love without a peer.
Dear heart, you are to me
All that the golden turning of the year
Calls back in memory;
All scents of honey in a field of hay,
All morning windows wide,
All heartbreak that is kin to yesterday,
All music made a bride.
A seven-years’ passion is a holy thing:
For this cries on and on—
The happy fragrance that is still the spring
When all the springs are gone.

The Plain—Evening.
Mile after mile the grey grass fills the eye,
Mile after mile the black soil greets the
grey;
Full circle round the plain swings on its
way
To meet its sister circle of the sky.
No tree, save some poor lignum, harsh and
dry,
No shade, save where the plodding team-
ster’s dray
Moves on so slowly that it seems to stay,
Held.fast in some illimitable sty.
The mirage leaves her mocking dance at last
And folds her luring pictures and is fled.
The sun sinks slowly to his western tent
And as the twilight’s herald stars are
sent
To burn the welcome message: “Day is
dead!”
Across the plain the cloak of night is cast.

At Narara.
Spirit of Narara, whom is it you seek,
Haunting hill and hollow, golden glade and
creek —•
£ou with all your shadows, all your gleam
and glow?
fs it Henry Kendall, he who loved you so
Summers long ago?
Spirit of Narara, voiced by singing gums,
Pines and sighing sheoaks, back your whisper
comes;
Though their tops in wind-notes, sweet of
tone, you speak:
“He, my first of lovers, it is he I seek,
Haunting glade and creek.”
Spirit of Narara, voiced by birds and trees,
He who stood enchanted by your melodies,
Weaving for your music words of gold to
suit,
Still is singing, singing like a magic flute,
Though his tongue be mute.
Spirit of Narara, seek no more for him,
Roaming by lit waters and through wood-
lands dim; ■
He your first of lovers, he who voiced your
charms,
Sighing; sobbing, singing, deaf to life’s
alarms.
Sleeps in Glory’s arms.

Summer.
Red of the rose that o’ermantles a casement
whence lover to lover leans;
Red of heart-blood on a dagger of envy, red-
der than rubies of queens,
Passion in flower or hatred at wait where
paradise-foliage screens.
White of the noonday on walls of the South
that are starker than sun-bleached bone;
White of bared women whose henna-stained
feet tread pavements of pink-veined
stone;
White of a lily asleep on a fountain, perfect
and pure and alone. -
Poised like a soul in Nirvana, where the
fires of all loves become White-
Consummation in place of negation • a day
that is stripped of the night;
For the heart of the furnace is pallid, a core
of unfluctuant light.
Gold of the wilderness-ways, flower-gilded,
where deathless Launcelot rides;
Gold on the decks of a lawless ship in the
warm blue lap of the tides;
And the gold of a captive’s loosened hair,
the gleam of her panting sides.
Green of the cypress that stands like a
column of malachite in the heat;
Green of the music-breathing reeds that are
trampled by centaur feet—
O cowering girl where the myrtles mix, is
the strength of a wood-god sweet?
Purple of thunder, swift and unfathered,
darkening the poon of the day ;
Purple of him whose conquering chariot fol-
lows a thunderous way;
Purple of hate where a woman outrivalled
narrows her eyes to slay.
Blue of the silken sea revealing the foam-
white Mother of Love;
Wonder-blue of a milk-warm night with the
star-flames golden above,
And the head of the watcher at rest ’twixt
breasts as amorous-soft as a dove.
Colors of beauty and passion—red of a rose
or a blood-red knife :
Pain and jov at their apex mingle—is not
their essence strife?
When the fiery angel kisses our brows, shall
we hail him as Death or Life' 3

THE HOPE FOR IRELAND.
Forty years ago Parnell said that the Irish
would never get anything out of a British
Government except by “threats and violence.”
The one chilling feature of last week’s settle-
ment is that it comes as the culmination, of a
series of upheavals which carry a superficial
suggestion that the Lost Leader was right.
To. begin with, the Irish Nationalists in the.
House of Commons were only respected when
they became intolerable. Measures then
began to be dangled before them which were
known as Home liule bills, though they
didn’t offer anything resembling real home
rule; and eventually one of them became
law\ Ulster, under the direction of English
Toryism, next decided to fight the menace to
Castle ascendancy by the Parnell for-
mula. Captain Craig wrote in the London
Morning Post (9/l/’ll) that “Germany
anti the German Emperor would be preferred
to the rule of John Redmond” ; and Bonak
Law said in the House of Commons
(1/1/T3) that “these people in the north-
east of Ireland, from the whole of their past
history, would, I believe, prefer to accept the
government of a foreign country rather than
submit to be governed by lion, gentlemen
below the gangway.” The Irish Church-
man remarked fl4/11/’l3) :
We have the offer of aid from a powerful' Con-
tinental monarch who, if Home Rule is forced
on the Protestants of Ireland, is prepared to send
an army sufficient to relcu'se 'England of any
further trouble in Ireland by attaching: it to his
dominion, believing-, as he does, that if our King
bleaks his coronation oath by signing the Horne
ltule Bill he will, by so doing, have forfeited his
claim to rule Ireland.
The oath never to accept any form of Home
Rule was taken by Ulster arid signed in the
Covenanters’ blood; Carson raised his army
for use against tlje Crown; the Government
was bluffed into shelving its Home Rule
Act. The Easter rebellion followed in due
course, and the horrors which were the fruit
of it. And now comes settlement. The
vital difference between the 1.11. A. and the
Carson army was, of course, that the
Nationalists had the will to fight, while the
Captains of Ulster, being chiefly London
Society men of the F. E. Smith type, were
disinclined to do more than demonstrate.
The demonstrator who is not prepared to
transmute drill into action must always go
down in the long run. The South has suc-
ceeded, at last, for many reasons, and one
of the chief of them no doubt is that —up to
a point—it was irreconcilable. The Sinn
Feiners were ready to face death for their
cause, as well as threaten for it.
* * * *
There is a convention among ultra-Tories
in the outlying parts of the Empire that
Ulster has always had a monopoly of loyalty
—an illusion which led the Argus to say
last Thursday :
To have attempted to apply compulsion to faith-
ful, loyal Ulster would have set the whole Empire
ablaze with indignation.
Stephen McKenna, an Irish Protestant,
educated at an English public school and
Oxford, who has spent most of his life in
English official circles, takes what may be
called the Westminster view in his latest
book. “Irish loyalists,” he observes drily,
“is the name applied to themselves by mem-
bers of a party which is Scottish in origin,
and which has repudiated its allegiance to
the Stuart dynasty, and threatened to repudi-
ate its allegiance to the Hanoverian dyn-
asty.” The truth is that in this matter of
loyalty—of devotion to England and to the
Throne —there never has been a pin to choose
between the Orangemen and the National-
ists. Both have- been equally willing to use
England while English ways suited them, and
curse their powerful neighbor the moment
it did anything to displease them. A clear
appreciation of that fact—an appreciation
which, does not exist, apparently, in many
Australian newspaper offices —has made the
English ready to come to a settlement with-
out much regard for Ulster’s prejudices,
solemn oaths and so forth; but, above all,
the arrangement has been induced by the
Nationalists’ passionate belief in the justice
of their cause. Inspired by that conviction,
patriots cannot be silenced or quelled, as
Italians, Serbs, Greeks, Poles and Belgians
have all proved in recent times: lacking it
there is no point in persisting in a show of
irreconcilability, as English Unionists, like
the gentleman who was once F. E. Smith,
are now demonstrating by their acceptance
of Irish independence.
* * * »
That the dour folks in the north-east cor-
ner of Ireland have no more real love for
the English than the English have for them
may be taken, then, as read. And by their
action in accepting an Ulster Parliament
they have admitted the principle that some
sort of Home Rule is endurable. What
stands, in the circumstances, between them
and that speedy agreement with the South
by which alone their common country can
acquire full national self-expression and the
utmost measure of prosperity? The powers
held by the northern House are so paltry
that it is bound, as soon as they are under-
stood by the general public, to assume the
position of one of our Legislative Councils.
The Dublin Parliament, on the other hand,
has, with one exception, every power en-
joyed by the British Parliament. It will
impose what taxes it likes ; have full tariff
rights even in respect of the products of the.
mainland; control its own post-office and
similar services; even, if it wishes, maintain
an army. The status of the Irish Free State
will, in all respects, be that of Australia,
except that it will not have a national navy ;
and there is not the least doubt that, as soon
as it can afford that luxury, it will be en-
couraged to indulge in it. Ulster, by stand-
ing out, foregoes all the advantages of partici-
pating in these developments, and, what is
still more unfortunate from its own stand-
point, it loses the chance to influence the
policies which will control them. Arid the
heart-breaking futility of such irreconcila-
bility is evident from the fact that it can
never lead anywhere. There is no ideal in-
volved, and no earthly prospect of creating
in any reasonable mind an impression to the
contrary. No one, not even the editor of
a Melbourne Freetrade paper, is likely to be
permanently stimulated by the spectacle of
Ulster sitting irritably on the edge of things,
talking deafeningly about its loyalty, but
doing nothing to prove it. That is a Drand
of irreconcilability which no more pays in
national than it does in industrial problems.
If Ulster wants to satisfy the Empire that
it is loyal in the only way that counts —that
it can love for the flae as well as hate for
it, work as enthusiastically to unite the
Irish race as it has worked hitherto to
divide it —then it w r ill co-operate with the
South, and Ireland ought presently to be one
of the most aboundinsrly prosperous coun-
tries in the world. And it is quite likely that
Ulster will attempt just that, and soon, if
the party politicians are only patriotic
enough, in their turn, to leave it alone.
PENSION DOCKING AND CRIMINAL
LIBEL.
In his last Budget speech Joseph Cook dis-
closed that the Federal Government had
cut down the pensions of returned soldiers
by £697,000 in the preceding 12 months;
and an allegation which has been freely
made at R. S. League meetings of late —
that the Repatriation Commission is operat-
ing under instructions to retrench the dis-
abled about another million in the coming
financial year—is not contradicted. The
majority of those affected are naturally men
whose health lias broken down through ex-
posure in one form or another —T.B. cases,
sufferers from asthma, bronchitis, chronic
rheumatism and the like. It is impossible
for even the most loyally Nationalist Com-
mission to decide that a missing arm or leg
is “a disability not due to war service.” On
me other nand, in accordance with a nue
wnich was not made public when members
of the Hughes Government were calling for
volunteers, troubles attributable to
carry. no pension. But it is possible to
attribute the beginnings of almost every dis-
ease to some form of V.D., contracted or
hereditary. V.D. iS so much the father of
disease that medical men commonly look
for a syphilitic or gonorrhoeal history
in diagnosing most debatable cases.
The value of the above-mentioned rule
as a pension-eradicator lies in the fact
that, wnile anyone can accuse an ex;-soldier
of having had V.D., neither he nor anyone
else can disprove it. It might be imagined
—in fact, outside the military system it
would be taken for granted—that if a man
(1) had been passed tit by the doctors on
enlistment, (2) did his time, in and out of
the trenches, without being committed to a
dermatological hospital, and (3) was dis-
charged unfit in liingland without any sug-
gestion on his hospital card as to the presence
of V.D., the evidence would make him safe
from the charge of being a syphilitic on his
arrival in Australia. Consider, however,
the case of No. 2746, Private J.L.P., which
is but one of hundreds for which the present
pensions policy is responsible:—
After 3t years’ service P. returned (l/9/’l9) as
a cot case aboard the Burma. He had been under
treatment for a year as a T.B. suspect, and was
suffering from chronic bronchitis. Arrived in Syd-
ney he put in a pension claim (his bronchitis made
sustained labor impossible), and it was disallowed
on the usual grounds—“disability not due to war
service.’’ In other words, the Commission now found
that he had suffered from syphilis. His record made
no mention of it, and his paybook was clean. ■ Two
Wasserman blood-tests made in a Sydney hospital at
his own request gave negative reactions. A Mac-
quarie-street (Sydney) doctor wrote that he would
“defy any man to say how the bronchitis or the
tumor on this man's lung was brought about.’’ The
tumor “is of doubtful origin, and was not influenced
by a course of 606.’’ The Commission adhered to
its decision; and P., wjio left to fight.for the Empire
in robust health, is now unable to work, and is
destitute.
* * * ' *
The Bulletin has. always claimed that
the convention by which soldiers who acquire
V.D. are treated as malefactors belongs, to
the Dark Ages and should be abolished. So
long as a man remains a civilian, so long, in
war-time, as he refrains from risking his life
for his country, he may acquire any such
disease with impunity, so far as the law is
concerned. If he is married he may infect
his wife or the wife or daughter of someone
else and go scot-free; and if he is singie
clergymen will marry him to whatever un-
happy girl he chooses without a single em-
barrassing question. A public servant may
die of syphilis—“the greatest of the killing
diseases” —and he will forfeit neither his
salary nor his pension. If a civilian
patient decides to be treated, the most elabo-
rate precautions are taken to protect anyone
learning of his affliction. Contrast with
this the attitude of the military machine
towards a V.D. subject, in the ranks. In
the late war thousands of Australian young-
sters were drafted through London, which —
unlike the unregenerate cities on the other
side of the Channel—-adheres to freetrade in
vice, and is, in consequence, the final rally-
ing place of every diseased unfortunate who
has been debarred from practising her trade
in her own country. Nothing of a serious
nature was done till the closing stages of the
world-tragedy to protect our lads from the
massed battalions of contagion through which
they had to pass, night and day, in every
West End street. When a soldier fell, and
the almost inevitable ensued, his misfortune
was made as public as possible. It was
proclaimed on his unit parade, and entered
in his paybook and on his record. His pay
was stopped. He was committed for treat-
ment to a compound, the inmates of which
were Visible to any passers-by who cared to
look through the wire. It been argued
that such measures are necessary in the in-
terests of military efficiency. And yet it is
likely that in any more men become in-
capacitated as combatants through drink
than through V.D. A common class of V.D.
subject was back in the trenches within six
weeks of the notification of his trouble, as
good for fighting purposes as ever, though
doomed probably in the years ahead, if the
chances of battle spared him. The soaker,
who was every'bit as deliberate in his health-
ruining methods as the other class of sinner,
gradually became incapacitated from going
near the line at all ; and in many cases he
was unable eventually to do useful work out
•of it. But it was the rarest thing for him
to suffer in either prestige or pay, provided
he destroyed his system with a reasonable
amount of discretion. Oddly enough the
boozers of the different units could generally
rely on preferential treatment in many re-
spects. So that, the merciless punishments
meted out to V.D. sufferers have little or no
real relation to the part which V.D. plays in
unfitting a soldier for the immediate duty of
engaging his enemy. The truth is these
penalties are not justifiable on a basis of
reason at all. They are quasi-religious sur-
vivals of the period when lunatics were
flogged or dipped for witchcraft.
* * * *
It is bad enough that soldiers who have
indisputably contracted V.D. should be so
punished, seeing that the authorities who
for years have taken such pains to prevent
the spread of other contagious diseases —-
plague, small-pox and the rest —did absolutely
nothing in Britain during three-parts of the
war to cope with the most prevalent of all
contagious diseases. Still, most of these
men knew the chances they were taking,
even if enlightenment did not come till after
they had signed on “for the duration.” But
could anything be more intolerable in its
injustice than a case—and it is common
enough—of the type quoted above? A man
goes overseas and takes particular care to
avoid infection. He may have a wife to
whom he is devoted, or he may hold a civil-
ian position in which character is the
essence of the contract. He gets into hos-
pital with one of the innumerable complaints
which a normal man might never know
without going on active service, and is sent
home a wreck. For the first time he learns
that he has been stigmatised' as a V.D. suf-
ferer. Negative blood-tests, the evidence of
unbiased doctors—these things go for
nothing. He loses his miserable pension rights,
and, in addition, becomes a pariah in the
eyes of his family and friends. In Canada
and South Africa they handle the question
0 f the disabled soldier on lines which are
not merely logical and humane, but which
in the long run are bound to be the cheapest
from the nation’s standpoint. With them
every man who was passed fit for service is
ipso facto presumed to have been sound
when he joined up. If he has been sent
home unfit his Government looks no further
than his medical sheet in estimating his pen-
sion. Officials are not allowed, as with us,
where there has been no record of a sojourn
in a V.D. compound, to diagnose gonorrhoea
from trench rheumatism, or syphilis from a
blemished lung. Under the arrangement
which is functioning so vigorously in Aus-
tralia just now, it should not be long before
every claimant for a pension who has not had
one or more portions of his anatomy blown
away, will find himself liable to a summary
conviction of having contracted V.D.
VOYAGING ROUND AUSTRALIA.
Big vessels are being built for the Common-
wealth’s mercantile fleet at a cost of £3O a
ton when similar craft, almost new, are in
the market at £lO. The idea is to manu-
facture employment, and the trouble is
charged up to loans at a time when loans
are more expensive than ever before. The
ships may never pay for their keep, being
liable to die of senile decay before a boom
comes again. The Federal authority doesn’t
seem to have any present use for either the £3O
or the £lO variety. It is laying up the Austral-
debt and the Australslump to eat their heads
off in harbor, and with them are ships-of the
D class, like the Dander and the Doneup,
to say nothing of other classes. Yet there
are ports and inlands that are perishing for
lack of ships. Albany, which with common-
sense and fair treatment would be one of
Australia’s great ports, with one of Austra-
lia’s big cities alongside it, was lately re-
ported .to be dying on an allowance of one
steamer a month. It has become quite
habitual for prosperous or recently pros-
perous. settlements of the pioneering sort —
the kind that line the coasts of North
Queensland, the Gulf, the Northern Terri-
tory and the top of Westralia —to wire
remote headquarters that the lone, lorn
steamer hasn’t been sighted since last Mel-
bourne Cup day, and that the place is out
of all civilised things except old boots and
second-hand Testaments. Yet when the
missing galleon turns up it probably finds
difficulty in discharging its freight, being
met on the wharf by the magnates, of the
Watershed Workers’ Union with impreca-
tions and a blackmailing scheme.
•** . *
The Navigation Act is part of the trouble.
That law, based largely on a hustling United
States precedent, provides in effect that onlv
Australian ships may pick up cargo and pas-
sengers at an Australian port for delivery at
another Australian port. The U.S. idea
was to prevent the strange Jonah working
on the U.S. coast, so that the local man
might do so instead. The Australian idea,
judging by results, was to prevent the
stranger working, and stop at that. Naturallv
discoveries soon began to be made. .It
might be worth the while of the well-laden
ocean-liner bound for Asiatic ports to drop
in at, say, Darwin in passing and land 20
tons of cargo and do a few odd jobs. But
if Darwin was the terminal port it was
cheaper to throw the wretched 20 tons over-
board at Cairns and turn back there. It
was still easier to have nothing to do with
it in the first place. Some relief was
afforded by allowing certain ships to ignore
the Act in certain places, but it was insuf-
ficient relief. The scheme worked well
enough in the U.S., where it is impossible to
lay out a coastwise voyage of any length
without having a big city at the beginning
and middle and end of it. And it doesn’t
matter much to Samuel if shipping arrange-
ments do go astray, for every place worth
calling one has its railway connections. But
some 4000 miles of Australia’s coast-line is
short of railways, barring disjointed frag-
ments. And this region, contains no place
large enough to qualify as the terminus of
a shipping line of any importance, though
there are some that were good enough re-
garded as wayside stations or sidings on the
road to Canton or Calcutta or London.

A suggestion which might be worth con-
sideration is that the Commonwealth should
get some of its idle vessels to work and start
a service right round the Commonwealth—
or, rather, two services, one each way. This
would at least bring the small places which
are in danger of forgetting what a ship is
like into touch with civilisation, and prevent
them being reduced at intervals to picking
up precarious meals on the seashore. Such
a service would of course have to be run
economically, else it would only add another
dead horse to a list that is already prepos-
terously long, and economy could not hap-
pen if it was bushranged regularly in the
good old style at every northern port and
occasionally elsewhere. Better results
might be achieved if all loading and dis-
charging, at least on that dangerous stretch,
was done by the crew —men under ship’s dis-
cipline. The ships could carry their own
copy of the liiot Act if considered neces-
sary until the situation simmered down, but
it isn’t likely that a machine-gun would be
required. If such a line were established the
depopulation of the North might be stayed
and its industries partially revived pending
the completion of the South-to-North rail-
way to put the neglected and almost aban-
doned tropic land on a completely new basis.
If the Federal Circular Line extended its
activities in time to adjacent Asiatic regions,
and supplemented the scanty harvest of our
own North with the shekels of the heathen,
.so much the better. The present position
is that the Fleet must do something or rust,
and something must be done for the North
or it will rot.


DOMINION STATUS—AND NATIONAL
STATUS.
“Far more serious is the loose and dangerous
talk about the ‘new status of the Dominions.’
Precisely what this new status is no one seems to
know. All that we know is that Mr. Hughes
was allowed to sign the Peace Treaty on behalf
of Australia. .. .How shallow the whole pretence
really is was shown when the Washington Confer-
ence was summoned.” —G. C. Dixon (Bulletin
il nr 21).
Anyone who remembers the views of an
English grandfather, as expressed in (say)
the seventies of last century, will find a
familiar note in Mr. Dixon’s remarks. The
looseness and danger of Wentworth’s talk
about responsible government were taken for
granted by those of his contemporaries who
rejoiced to be called Colonials and abjured
the name Australians. Little by little the
popular viewpoint changed. The old people
died or went, as they used to say, “home,” to
spend the money they had made and be
buried in what they still regarded as their
own country ; Australians began to be born
in great numbers. Simultaneously, the thing
which Mr. Dixon accuses some unnamed
person of calling “our new status” began
to manifest itself. How little new the idea
is may be gathered from the fact that over
60 years ago Sir John Macdonald was mak-
ing exactly the same claims for Canada as
Hughes and Smuts are now making for
their countries. And even then the concep-
tion was not brand-new. It is clearly im-
possible for anyone to pick up a calendar,
select two dates and say: “On this day you
were Colonials, on that Australian nationals;
on this bound, on that free.” In constitu-
tional matters as in life, which constitutional
development so resembles, things do not hap-
pen in that way. Who will be bold enough
to say exactly when the Royal veto lapsed
in England for the purposes of practical
administration? As far back as 1785 Paley
(‘Moral Philosophy”) remarked: —
When we contemplate the theory of the British
Government we see the King invested with the most
absolute personal impunity.; with a power of reject-
ing laws which have been resolved upon by both
Houses of Parliament; of conferring by his charter
upon any set or succession of men he pleases the
privilege of sending representatives into one House
of Parliament, or by his immediate appointment he
can place whom he will in the other. What is this,
a foreigner might ask, but a more circuitous, despot-
ism? Yet when we turn our attention from the
legal existence to the actual exercise of royal
authority in England, we see these formidable pre-
rogatives dwindled into mere ceremonies.
At some stage in history the members of
the House of Hanover became British.
VV hen i As soon as the Elector became
George I. of England? At the time the
balic Law excluded Queen Victoria from
the Hanoverian throne? Or during the late
war when those members of the Royal family
who were domiciled in the United Kingdom
adopted English names? After the Norman
Conquest the King of England—and through
'him England—was subservient to France.
Precisely when did the status of the
English change? A hundred similar
problems could be submitted, to all of which
different answers might be given by different
Britishers. But one thing is certain: none
of them would go to America for an authori-
tative opinion as Air. Dixon has done in the
case of the Commonwealth.
The changing status of Australia has been
gradual, like every constitutional change
which is not effected by an Act of Parlia-
ment. Within the lifetime of many who are
still amongst us the British Parliament
claimed the right to alienate unenclosed lands
in Australia. External defence was attended
to by the Royal Navy and internal defence
by English regiments. The colonies were
not fiscally free, and as regards domestic
legislation :
The Governor of a colony, say Victoria, may
directly refuse his assent to a bill passed by both
Houses of the Victorian Parliament. In this case
the bill is finally lost, just as would be a bill
which had been rejected by the colonial council, or
as would be a bill passed by the English Houses of
Parliament if the Crown were to exert the obsolete*
prerogative of refusing the royal assent.
That was written by Dicey in his “Law of
the Constitution” in 1885 ; and, as showing
the slowness with which even the most
obvious of needed changes come in a conser-
vative community like ours, this principle—
one that belongs to the dark ages of English
political life—has only just passed into
oblivion. Meanwhile, we have achieved all
the other characteristics of a sovereign
State. We have a navy and an army; we
impose tariffs against Britain as well as
against foreigners; we declare war, and hav-
ing done so send our own divisions, disci-
plined, despite British protests, according to
our own ideas. Nothing was foreshadowed
more clearly at the recent Imperial confer-
ences than the doom of the Privy Council
appeal system. Legally the people of Eng-
land are still living under a despot who can
confiscate every liberty they have struggled
for during the centuries: constitutionally,
however, they are free. Legally Australia is
at least as dependent on the whims of the
British Parliament as it was when the
Colonial Lands Validity Act (1865) was
passed. In constitutional practice the posi-
tion is as stated by Joseph Chamberlain
at Glasgow in 1903: —
They [the Dominions] are sister States’ able to
treat with us from an equal position; able to hold
to us, willing to hold to us ; but also able to break
with us.
At some stage in a young man’s life it
becomes evident that he has. as tile saying
is, “grown up.” Australia, which had been
approaching maturity in an obvious man-
ner for over a decade, definitely grew up
during the war; and the process of attaining
complete independence was in no way
affected by the nation’s symbolic attachment
to the British crown. Why, then, does the
U.S. , Government persist in treating the
Commonwealth as a colony, though another
U.S. Government, when confronted with
Canadian Confederation and the Canadian
Pacific Railway, said through its Secretary
of State: “We understand that we are face
to face with a nation, and that we must dis-
cuss public questions from that view”?
The answer has nothing whatever to do
with fine constitutional points. It is an
affair, as President Harding might himself
put it> of inability to deliver the goods. Aus-
tralia is absent from the Washington Con-
ference table for the same basic reason that
Liberia and Monaco and the Republic of
San Marino are absent. Germany is
not outcast because it is a former
enemy. The United States are trading
with Germans and English people are
marrying them. But the nation is
disarmed, and while it remains disarmed
its voice at a discussion on the settlement
of world affairs will be of no more conse-
quence than the voice of Korea or Haiti.
The U.S.A. are anxious to bar Japanese
immigrants; many American navvies will not
work in the same gang with a Japanese. If
the Japanese were still a picturesque,
pleasant-mannered and artistic folk with no
navy and an army equipped with the weapons
of the Renaissance period they would have
as little hope of being invited to send a dele-
gate to Washington as the inhabitants of
Iceland —or ourselves. Being what they are,
a colored race not eminent in anything but
the capacity to fight and the will to prepare
to do so, they send their representatives as
a matter of course to the country that makes
social outcasts of their nationals. The
moral is evident. If Australians ever mean
to have a say in world affairs this side of the
Millennium, they must pay for it. Once
they do that it will be immaterial if they call
themselves Colonials or by their right name.
They will be welcomed at the Conference
tables of the Powers as readily as any Jap.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Move Towards Peace.
Last week the world took two large strides
towards peace. Out of London came a
settlement of the Irish question acceptable
to all except the fanatics on both sides;
out of Washington a four-Power agreement
to respect the status quo in the Pacific for 10
years at least. The aggreement supersedes the
Anglo-Japanese Alliance and is to remain
in force after 1932 unless or until it is
denounced by one of the contracting parties
—Britain, France, Japan and the U.S.A. —
and then 12 months’ notice will be necessary.
It is nominally independent of the proposed
naval holiday, but that will follow as a
matter of course. Before the treaty operates
it will necessarily have to be ratified by the
Parliaments of the four Powers. The ad-
hesion of France and Britain is merely a
matter of form. Japan, it is certain, will
also fall into line, for the Japanese militarists
have been very plainly warned by Balfour,
the British negotiator, that the object for
which the old alliance was made “no longer
exists,” and that Britain has for years wanted
to “shelve the ancient and worn-out agreement
and replace it by something new, embracing
all the interested Powers.” Which means,
if it means anything, that under no circum-
stances would the British Empire go to war
with the U.S.A. on Japan’s behalf. Only
in the U.S. Senate is the fate of the treaty
doubtful. It is assured of opposition there,
for it is certainly a departure from the tra-
ditional policy of the Republic, and a two-
thirds majority—the provision that wrecked
the Versailles pact—is necessary to carry
it. But on this occasion the Lodge group
of Republicans who destroyed Woodrow
Wilson’s work are on the side of the Gov-
ernment ; and the indications are that rati-
fication will be adopted. In which case, a
magnificent contribution will have been
made to the greatest of all world interests,
and the Plarding administration will be
remembered for all time.
The Million Fantods and the Million
Farms.
The reflections of an old' orchardist:—
In Sydney 40 years ago fruit was cheap and the
grower had a fair return for his labor. Mostly he
lived close to town and could cart his crop to
market. The increasing size of the city pushed the
orchardist further out, so he has to send his fruit
by train; and land near suburban stations having
g building value, he has as far to cart to the train
as he once had to cart to market. When the orchard-
ist took 20 cases of peaches from Chatswood to
George-street market, a shilling a case was payable;
and the shopkeeper could live while retailing at
two or three shillings a case. The addition of rail
and city cartage charges raised the minimum pay-
able price to the grower in 1914 to half-a-crown,
with a corresponding rise in the retail price. In
1921, owing to increased charges, the minimum price
at which the orchardist can sell his fruit without
loss on the Sydney market is four shillings; and
the average shopkeeper will be working for nothing
owing to his overhead expenses if he does not get
eight shillings a case.
These figures apply to a grower in the County of
Cumberland, the outer area of Sydney suburbs. As
you go further away from the one market the
freight increases; also the chance of a fruit-crop
being unpayable. On the Hawkesbury, if fruit will
not realise four shillings a case it is hest left to
rot under the trees, and hundreds of thousands of
cases do so rot. At Bathurst the figure is higher,
at Orange higher still; and at Leeton the chance of
marketing green fruit at a profit in the one city
must be rare. At Pera bore, where fine oranges are
grown, the one market is beyond reach.
What is true of fruit is true of every other
article grown on the land: its money value depends
upon where the man is with whom it can be
exchanged. In N. S. Wales the man lives almost
exclusively in Sydney, and his wants are already
oversupplied; otherwise there would not be regular
gluts of all kinds of produce. Each of these gluts
knocks a percentage of the men on the land off
it. As Sydney grows bigger it wants more produce;
but per head it gets less owing to the inevitable
increase in the overhead charges.
Roughly, as the back yard of Sydney, N. S. Wales
is fully populated. The one big city has brought
this about by a protective policy in railway freights
and centralisation. By pursuing the same policy
elsewhere other cities might be established in what
is now the one big city’s back yard, and the number
of successful agriculturists would proportionally in-
crease. Cocky does not want driving on the land,
for with a dog’s chance of making a do of it he
is always rushing the job. We can have the million
farms in N. S. Wales all right as the natural sup-
pliers of the wants of 50 scattered manufacturing
and protected cities —protected as Sydney is pro-
tected. The farms will arise automatically, just as
Chow vegetable, gardens arise. Ah Sin can grow
vegetables anywhere in N. S. Wales; but he is
careful to make his gardens in number and size
according to an existing local demand. The orchard-
ist and the cocky are in like case.
Incidentally, many of us who still hang on could
not do so but for one curious circumstance. I grow
a beautiful orange which is at its prime in June;
but as in that month the market for citrus fruit
is poor, these oranges are allowed to hang on the
trees till October. They are then over-ripe or
dried; but the price for the much inferior article
is payable. At Christmas-time I have had splendid
passions sent to the Sydney tip, and at other times
I have sold almost empty shells for 10 a
case. Last season, in October, I sold mandarins
not worth eating—they were dried—for 255. a case ;
earlier, as prime fruit, they did not bring half as
much. Thus, owing to the chronic glut of season-
able fruit on the over-supplied Sydney market, the
payable line is out-of-season rubbish. The vegetable-
grower and farmer have much the same experience.
If, therefore, more producers are, so to speak, arti-
ficially created, they will either fail themselves or
drive out some of those already hanging on to the
limited one-city demand.

Mad Enough for Anything.
McGirk’s Motherhood Endowment Bill
(N.S. W.) is so essentially a vast pre-election
bribe that its author doesn’t scruple to
defend it on that line. His favorite retort to
critics when the measure was being slugged
through the Assembly was “The ladies will
vote against you if you say that.” And
then he widened the area of his unabashed
appeal for support in return for £1,600,000
(or it may be £3,000,000) a year:—
The fairly general level of prosperity enjoyed
during the war was in a large measure due to the
separation allowance paid the wives and children
of men in the A.I.F. Tradespeople, on referring to
their records, will find how seriously business has
fallen off since the termination of that allowance.
What was good enough in war-time in that respect
should be good enough in peace-time. But it has
been left to our Government to give practical effect
thereto by introducing Motherhood Endowment,
which will mean the restoration of that allowance
principle throughout the entire State. The money
which will be made regularly available as a result
of the endowment will operate in the direction of
counteracting the prevailing financial stringency of
the times and the growing tendency on the part of
banks and financiers to restrict credits. Such a
tendency must benefit the State as a whole. Those
who are opposing the Motherhood Endowment Bill
are foolishly endeavoring to check that beneficial
tendency at a time when it is most necessary to
maintain and increase the purchasing power of the
people. Others may consider it good business for
the State to send millions of money out of the
country as interest on loans, but I consider it better
business and wiser statesmanship for the State to
spend the money on the life needs of the children of
our nation, and at the same time to keep the money
in the country.
An equal amount of pernicious rot was never
crammed into a few sentences. It is a
farrago of false suggestions and absurd
inferences. To begin with, the “fairly
general level of prosperity enjoyed during
the war” was an artificial, loan-fed pros-
perity which disappeared inevitably when
war conditions ceased and the interest bill
had to be met. To restore it by borrowing
would be impossible, even if it were desir-
able, for the required amount of loan money
can’t be got. _ And to secure the same result
by taxation is a still wilder dream of folly
in a country where metal-mining has prac-
tically ceased, the pastoral industry is stag-
nant, the price of wheat has got down almost
to the pre-war level (the harvest, moreover,
is only middling), and the ironmasters of
Newcastle and Lithgow are unable to keep
going. Yet the demented Dooley-McGirb
Government proposed and - still proposes to
make the attempt. From manufacturers
half-ruined by the so-called basic wage and
the 44-hour week, and farmers, pastoralists,
fruitgrowers and business men smitten by
the slump in prices, Lang demands another
£2,000,000 in the way of income-tax. From
the same depleted pockets McGirr would
drag a further £2,000,000, perhaps more, for
distribution among the mothers and milkmen
and butchers and grocers whose votes he
wants. And he calls this process of destruc-
tion “counteracting the prevailing financial
stringency of the times.” He affects to
believe that plundering the farmer and the
manufacturer and handing portion of the
booty to the suburban retailer “must benefit
the State as a whole,” although its only
possible effect would be to hasten the com-
mercial crisis which his fool-Government
seems bent on bringing about. The Lord
knows what he means by his absurd rigma-
role about keeping the money in the country
instead of sending millions abroad as inter-
est on loans (his crowd sent seven millions
abroad last year), unless it is proposed to
repudiate the debt. In matters of finance
his Government is mad enough for anything.

No White Women Need Apply.
Jackson, M.H.K. for Bass (Tas.), who
visited the Northern Territory as a member
of the Public Works Committee, came back
convinced (1) that the Territory is “a
white man’s country,” and (2) that “its
development is a question, not of the white
man, but of the white woman.” Meaning,
of course, that unless it is made fit for
white wives and mothers to live in it will
never be anything more than a match for a
Portuguese colony. Other travellers have
returned south with the same thoughts as
the gentleman from Tasmania, although they
may not have had his opportunities of gather-
ing material. But in the scheme of settle-
ment devised for the North by sapient
southern politicians and bureaucrats, the
white woman, Jackson found, has no place.
She is regarded as either a superfluous
luxury or an unnecessary evil. For instance:
I talked with a police officer who was returning
from Anthony s Lagoon, and who had resigned from
the force. I asked him why he was leaving the ser-
vice. He replied that, although he had offered to
pay the travelling expenses of his wife-to-be in order
that she might make a home for him in the Terri-
tory, the Police Department had refused him permis-
sion to marry.
The idea of a mere N.T. policeman wanting
to marry! Are there not heaps of gins?
Again:—
A sick woman at Alice Springs had to ride for 10
days on a camel to get medical treatment. It
would cost the Commonwealth only £2OO or £3OO
a year to maintain a buggy service,' which would also
du to carry the mails. There isn’t a doctor from Oodna-
datta to Marranboy, a distance of 1000 miles. On
one stretch of 300 miles, where there are 100 men
three women and several children. 12 good Austra-
lians died in 12 months from malaria. Their deaths,
the people of the district told me, were due to the
lack of nurses.
But if pioneers are so disobliging as to fall
sick they must put up with the consequences.
That is the official attitude, as the following
remarks show:—
At each of the telegraph stations on the overland
route we heard complaints from the officer in charge
that the medicine-chests formerly supplied by the
licme and Territories Department were now withheld,
and, further, that these officers had been asked to pay
for the medicines out of their own pockets. Only
those who have had experience there or have passed
through those regions know what the medicine-c bests
really mean. The man who conveys the mail to
Newcastle Waters from the Katherine told me that he
had had to buy quinine to give to drovers whom he
found lying on the side of the road almost dying of
malaria. But, he added, the Postmaster-General’s
Department would fine him if he was late in deliver-
ing his mail, even though his lateness was due to
his refusal to leave men lying sick, and possibly
dying, on the roadside.
Here Poynton, Minister for Home and
Territories, protested that there must be
some mistake, inasmuch as his departmental
officials were positive that the medicine-chests
were still forwarded to the telegraph-
stations and were not charged for. To
which Jackson replied that the officer at
Powell’s Creek had assured him that he had
been refused medicine and had been asked
to pay £3-—“I saw a letter from the chief
medical-officer at Darwin on the point.”
And he threw this brick at Poynton’s
Government:—
In 1916 Parliament authorised the construction of
a bridge over the Katherine, which rises in the
rainy season over 80 feet. In that part of Aus-
tralia there are about 1000 white inhabitants cut off
from civilisation for three or four months in the year
owing to floods. Whatever route the railway line to
the Northern Territory takes, the bridge across the
Katherine must be built. But it hasn’t been started.
Yet the amount of money wasted since 1911
in transplanting hordes of sinecurists from
the southern capitals to Darwin would have
built the Katherine River bridge 50 times
over. It is a tragic story of gifts misspent
and resolutions vain. Still, the member for
Bass didn’t return a pessimist. Impressed
by the riches of the Barkly tablelands, he
considers that “if a bold policy of boring
upon settlement blocks is entered upon the
problem of the empty North will be solved.”
But other things are necessary as well as
water conservation —a new conscience and a
new outlook in the South, a recognition of
the fact that the North is a job for the
scientist, the engineer, the doctor, the geolo-
gist and not for meddlesome southern noli-
ticians and bureaucrats.

State Enterprises and Taxation.
Thebe is more in the disaster that has struck
State enterprise in Queensland than meets
the eye of the non-expert, though even he
can see enough to make his eye feel pretty
crowded. The Government there runs seven
businesses, or eight if the horribly bankrupt
railways are included, or nine reckoning its
rather unlucky dabblings in the steamship
line. Last year the eight panned out as
follows:—
Losses.
Railways .. .. .. £1,739,475
State Stations . . . . 194,148
State Cannery .. .. . . 29,742
State Produce Agency.. .. 27,734
Butcheries and Meatworks . . 13,123
State Fish Supply .. . . 9,808
Profits.
State Hotel at Babinda . . 1,066
Railway Refreshment Rooms . . 6,859
Net Loss . . . . £2,006,105
The railways are an old story, and, thanks
to a steady policy of putting up charges-
(increasing the cost of living, that is), they
aren’t much worse than they have been for a
good while back. But in meat and fish and
other things, where tlje cost of living took
itself in its own hands and prices flatly
refused to stay up, the disaster has been
great and sudden. If these State enter-
prises had been able to put up their prices
likewise the catastrophe might have been
averted. But, if they wanted to show the
true position, they would have had to put
their prices higher than appears on the sur-
face. For no balance-sheet suggests that
the State .enterprises charge themselves with
land-tax or, in the rare cases where there is
a net income, with income-tax. This means
that, where there is a profit, it is less than
it seems by the amount of the tax, and where
there is a loss the loss is more than it seems
by the amount of the tax. This foolish sort
of self-deception is practised in all States,
but where the taxes are heaviest the decep-
tion is biggest. And if a State really sets
out to abolish private enterprise which pays
taxes, and replace it by State enterprise which
doesn’t pay taxes, complete success must
mean that there will be no tax revenue at all.
State enterprise began before either land -or
income-taxes existed, and the position was
quite legitimate. When they came to pass
and the State exempted itself, it began to
nresent false balance-sheets, and when it goes
into so many lines of business the position
becomes serious.

Are the Kings Afraid of the Cabbages?
Hattie Knight considers the question:—
The King-game involves certain rules, with the
striking of certain attitudes, the uttering of certain
formulas. The King and his attendant Court must
conform to the rubrics, and all their doctrines are
bound to be limited. The Kings, in point of fact,
by reason of their kingship, are expected to make
kingish sounds and none other. Should a King
wake up some fine morning, bubbling with fresh and
original ideas, it would be found that in setting
these to the Court metre much of their true inspira-
tion and prime intention had been entirely obliter-
ated. For instance, the King and his Court had
some really splendid ideas, no doubt, for dealing
with the profiteer, but their enunciations soon re-
solved into the accepted formula that “drastic steps
must be taken at once fofc the organisation and
co-ordination of special commissions to deal with
the high cost of living.” So all speech noises uttered
by the King are conventionalised like the form of a
sonnet. And, as happens in the sonnet also, detail
and lucidity are sacrificed to metre.
It is, therefore, seldom apparent to us by sounds
and signs if the Kings are really nervous at the
invasion of the Cabbages, or are serenely indifferent.
The front of unruffled serenity may be but a bluff
demanded of kingish dignity. This will be noticed
in any King and his Court you happen to come
across. Even on the verge of collapse and annihila-
tion the Court must sustain a happy-ever-after
character, a contempt for all intrusive forces, a
serene ever-and-ever-amen manner.
The first thing we notifce about the Cabbage is
its greenness. For decorative purposes greenth is
essential, is vitally necessary to Australia; it is the

first important item in a landscape. We cannot do
without it —from a decorative point of view. But
being green is no help from a utility point of view.
It is, indeed, the unfortunate reason for all the
warped failures we find lying round. And these
Cabbages, who have acted in so uncabbage-like a
way as to depart from their Cabbage-patch, to try
their hand at the law-mdking game, are particularly
green.
Now, it is quite outrageous of the rulers to expect
Cabbages to remain on their Cabbage-patch, con-
cerning themselves with nothing but Cabbaging.
The King-leader once . asserted to a clamoring deputa-
tion that he was not a god. But at a time when
things looked very gloomy indeed for the Cabbage-
patch, he managed to secure every kind of assistance
in the matters of manuring, watering, etc., and he
and his Court undertook with supreme success the
entire market-gardening responsibility, and achieved
unparalleled results. It has been murmured, in fact,
that it is owing to their great success, as a result
of the Court’s assistance in war-time, that the
Cabbages have since asserted themselves.
Greenness is obviously a distinct virtue in a Cab-
bage ; but it is questionable if swelled head is
desirable.
It was thought at first that the Cabbage-movement
was to be made by Cabbages for Cabbages. That
seemed right and proper. The Cabbage philosophy
has ever been to concern itself with no matters in
the universe beyond the interests of Cabbagism. In
the past it was actually bad form, unheard of, for
Cabbages to be interested in what might be vital to
the welfare of a Geranium, a Mulberry-tree or a
Scotch Thistle. It sometimes seemed, in fact, that
among the Very Best Cabbages the existence of
Geraniums was unknown. They certainly scarcely
ever glanced at any but the Cabbage Columns in
the newspapers; and they gloried in such Cabbage-
like an attitude.
But now these sophisticated Cabbages, strong and
uppish with abnormal supplies of invigorating, sap,
are crisply standing up to the Kings and claiming,
not only that they can control all Cabbage affairs
better than less green things usually employed for
the purpose, but that they are also competent to
run all the others Shows in Creation!
The star comedian of the Cabbage band is fresh
and crisp, curling and green. His greenth is his
strong quality, and he has a beautiful way of spread-
ing himself beneath the bosky shade of himself. This
greenth, indeed, leads him into many indiscreet
capers, so that his progress is strewn with various
exuberant interjections. It is commonly repeated
about the Court that he was originally not a Cab-
bage at all, but a rather rank Cauliflower. But
when it was pointed out to him that the Cabbages
were out to win, he cheerfully became a Cabbage.
It is suggested that he may eventually become an
Onion.
All the Cabbages are furiously busy most of the
time now, and even the softer, squashier ones could
give a King’s Help a nasty smack in the eye if pro-
pelled by an experienced implement. They have
already danced up to the assembled Court of the
King-and-his-Helps, and poked their tongues out at
them. They have even bragged that they will man-
age to have the King’s pocket-money stopped if
the Kings don’t watch out.
Cabbagism is hardly mattering at all just now
in the first fever of indulging in action. It is
asserted that the Cabbages claim the power and
right to interfere with any business you like to
name. “Cabbage” has been found to have kinship
with all sorts of other words and suggestions. The
first syllable of “Cabinet,” for instance. From this
it is argued that the Cabbages were surely ordained
to rule the country, subserving all and everything
to the interests of the Cabbage-patch, of course.
And meanwhile, lurking on the outskirts, ready to
seize the throne at the first opportunity when the
King-and-his-Helps are occupied in warding off
some sudden onslaught of Cabbage-water, glower the
Wicked Uncle and his horde.
Is the King really afraid of the rising of the
Cabbages ?
Whether the patching of the Irish difficulty
will have any remarkable effect on the Irish
outside Ireland, and, if so, what, is an in-
teresting problem. Hitherto it has only been
necessary to be an Irish patriot in a general
way. The next uprising of the Irish ques-
tion, if there is another, will force a sharp
division into two sections, One' will flatly
refuse to risk its valuable British citizen-
ship by £oing any further. It will say that
it has sympathised all that can be expected
of it. and that if being pro-Irish means being
republican it will be anti-Irish for the
future. A less influential section with less
at stake will go the whole hog—verbally, at
least. It is further possible that the Irish-
man outside Ireland may begin to vanish.
Some Irish authorities reckon three dis-
tinct exoduses of Erin’s people. One began
in the days of Elizabeth. Its descendants
are quite submerged now, saye that some
names remain—as wholly submerged as the
fugitive Carthaginians who are said to have
taken refuge in Wexford and Cork. The
second army of emigrants set out after the
breakage of the Limerick treaty in the time
of William. They also lost their indivi-
duality and forgot Ireland. The people of
the third exodus —that of the last 80 years
—have to some extent been keeping by them-
selves in separate compartments to be ready
for the day of liberation. If they decide that
it has come and gone they may disperse also.
A great binding force will be gone.
The impending removal of the embargo on
trade with the enemy countries will close
another chapter in the interminable history
of political imbecility. Three years ago W.
M. Hughes announced that he proposed to
punish Germany (1) by extracting a thump-
ing indemnity and (2) by refusing admis-
sion to its goods. The indemnity was
agreed upon all right; but it never, occurred
to Fritz’s principal foes and creditors to
deprive him of his only means of fulfilling
his obligations to them. The Australian
Government has had a monopoly of that
policy. For three years it has striven to
attain the unattainable. But in spite of all
its efforts the economic interdependence of
the world, suspended during the war, has
reasserted itself. Slowly it has dawned
upon the Government that a country that
refuses to trade with another that owes it
money, even in the shadowy form of indem-
nities, injures itself. So German goods are
to come in openly, with safeguards against
dumping and juggling with the exchanges.
There is a suspicion that they have been
coming in surreptitiously, without any safe-
guard save a most inadequate tariff, for at
least a year. But nobody supposes that the
first instalment of the indemnity, due on
June 1 and dedicated to the purpose of cash-
ing Digger Bill’s gratuity bond, has blown
along, surreptitiously or otherwise.

“Sennacherib” : In this matter of pigeon-
slaughter, the issue is utterly plain. The
world does move forward, ai d nowadays ae-
THE EXTREMES.
“A Mr. Caird, managing director of the Australian Mercantile, Land and Finance Co., Ltd., in a
speech to shareholders recently in London, said that ‘Australia was a land of extremes, droughts,
floods and noxious animals, such as rabbits, dingoes, blowflies and mosquitoes!’”
"Hey, little man, have a look at the other end of me as well."
liberate cruelty to humanity or animals
offends a large majority in all civilised coun-
tries. But the old love of cruelty—inherited
from remote ancestors and rooted in the
pleasure of a consciousness of superior power
—still exists, and is exemplified in the pigeon-
shooter, the hare-courser, and the grocer’s
boy who delights to see his mongrel worry a
cat. “Backmarkeb” (B. 1/12/’2l), living in
a comparatively civilised age, cannot confess
cruelty, but is compelled to seek some grounds
on which he can claim that his wretched
orgies are humane. The absurdity of it all •
is obvious. If the underlying motive of the
slaughter were anything commendable, are
there not rifle-ranges calling for infinitely
superior skill in marksmanship? No; the
simple issue is between ordinary common-or-
garden cruelty and ordinary common-or-
garden decent humanity. Therefore “Back-
marker” wriggles. One of his wriggles is
particularly artistic. The pigeon-sport, he
says, “keeps going the hundreds of breeders
of homers who. deprived of the market for
their surplus birds created by the gun-clubs,
would have to go out of breeding.” Beauti-
ful ! If science succeeded in eradicating all
venereal disease and all zymotic diseases,
what a disaster for the world, since quite a
number of respectable suburban medicoes
would then hardly have a living! That the
Queensland Government, belonging to what
is nowadays the most reactionary of all par-
ties, should decide to countenance “Back-
marker’s amiable recreation is .not exactly
astonishing.

McNorth is with the ayes:—
“Gregor’s” idea of starting a New Guinea Society
(B. 1/12/’2l) is good. Years ago one or two
individuals, noting that little or nothing was being
done to record systematically the fast-disappearing
aspects of native life and conditions in Fiji, got
together in Suva and formed the Fijian Society. The
thing grew rapidly, till now it is the largest of its
kind in the South Pacific, and has brought within its
province the past and present conditions of several
groups. Among its objects are the preservation of
native legends—some of which are full of poetry-
traditions and records of ancient wars, and the study
of present conditions as affecting Brown Brother
generally. Meetings are regularly held, lectures
given, papers read and printed. Much valuable data
has been collected, and there is a comprehensive
museum. So far the society has not touched New
Guinea to any extent, and I think it would be a good
idea if “Gregor’s-” society got into communication
with it with a view to affiliation. Incidentally, the
founder of the Fijian Society was Colman Wall, the
present secretary and curator of the museum, a man
possessed of a graceful pen and an almost unrivalled
knowledge of the islands. In his youth he was
acquainted with the notorious Bully Haybs 4 of
whom he still treasures some fine tales.
The Bulletin is asked to invite any who

“Henry Horsecollar” : A number of the
people who habitually mix Irish grievances
with Australian affairs fled into print when
the “settlement” was announced the other
day and declared, that the oldest war on
earth was ended at last and that the dove
of peace brooded over Ararat. Their position
has been a difficult one, lately the pros-
pect of an Irish Republic was nothing less
than a nightmare to some of them. To men
of Irish birth or pure Irish parentage it
suggested the loss of all national status
except in a small island very far away ; the
loss of the vote and the right to sit in
Parliament or municipal councils everywhere
save there ; and the loss of the free run of
an Empire which has more good political,
diplomatic, military, naval and other billets
to dispense among bright young men than
the average. It was the orthodox thing to
demand absolute independence and absolute
separation from the imperial loaves and
fishes (except at the price of asking the old
enemy for naturalisation—in other words,
asking him for permission to repudiate the
Irish nationality), and to the people who were
in a position to loaf and fish that meant an
awkward dilemma. Yet those people were
the natural leaders from whom the fiercest
denunciation was expected. If they can
persuade the masses that a satisfactory vic-
tory has been gained for the cause of getting
out of the Empire by remaining inside the
Empire wliile losing all share in the control
of big Imperial affairs, it will be a blessed
relief. These folk are the victims of cir-
cumstances, like the devout Jew who doesn’t
really care for Palestine because his people
have outgrown it, and it is like an infant’s
“shimmy” on Goliath, but the old habits
stick like the appendix or the two buttons
at the back of a frock coat.

One of the minor blessings of the high cost
of living is that it promises to rid this fed-
up continent of the stupid anachronism of
imported State Governors. His Ex. of South
Aus. has resigned because he can’t live on
the salary, and the Speck’s Rubber Stamp
has obtained three months’ leave of absence
for the same reason, and has let it be known
that he isn’t coming back. Also rumors are
current regarding the intentions of a third
functionary, who hasn’t been long in his
job. The trouble in every case is that the
cost of entertaining the kind of people who
resort to Government House has soared
tremendously, whereas the salary has re-
mained at the pre-war figure. It is impos-
sible to cut out entertaining, for that would
alienate the support of the only class still
favorable to the retention of imported cocked
hats, and it is equally impossible to wrestle
a rise out of the Legislature. Some of the
State Parliaments couldn’t increase the Gov-
ernment House vote if they would, and
others wouldn’t if they could. In the past a
free-spending Rubber Stamp might supple-
ment the emoluments of his office by drawing
on an English income, but nowadays tax-
ation is so heavy that unless the estate is
extremely rich (which is seldom the case
these times) there isn’t much English income
to draw on. So Australian State Governor-
ships have lost their attractions for gentle-
men in the vice-king business. Once there
was a rush to get them ; now there is a rush
to quit them.

The Federal railway system is a patient who
is always in a low state, and, as usual, the
nurse announces a change for the worse. She
never reports anything else. For the year
to June, 1920, the business paid no interest,
though the taxpayer pays a mighty lot, and
was £101,879 short of working expenses. The
taxpayer paid that also and thanked his Joss
that he didn’t own any more railways to de-
velop the great natural resources of similar
country. For the year just closed the in-
terest earned was again nil, and the loss on
working was £106,551. The amount the tax-
payer had to find (interest and working loss
combined) was £400.000—fractions don’t
matter. The East-to-West dropped £91,339
and the interest—which was £87 per mile.
This line is complete and doing its best,
though it may do worse when Kalgoorlie
fades some more. The two fragments of
the South-to-North railway lost £60,460, or
£90 per mile, but these fragments end ear’ 1
at a stump in a wilderness, so there are
hopes for them when the work is complete
and fulfilling its destiny.
A kecent and violent reduction in the pro-
portion of apprentices to journeymen has.
left the N. S, Wales engineering trade with
such a surplus to work off that it is reckoned
no more learners can be taken on for three
years. At the end of that time, allowing for
the natural increase of population, the coun-
try will be importing full-grown engineers
from Germany, and building a new reforma-
tory to hold the three-years’ crop of boys
who, for want of a steady job, have become
demoralised in the paper-selling or race-
course business. Not that employers particu-
larly want apprentices, for there is always
a brooding fear lest a Court should sud-
denly treble their wages and leave the em-
ployer with a disastrous liability on his
hands. When wages were rushed up in the
building trade, Saturday work knocked off
and the great go-slow established on the
other five days, some men with contracts on
hand went broke and others left off commit-
ting themselves. But the man who couldn’t
find a contractor to build him a house ex-
cept on staggering terms hated to begin
building with day labor lest sow“ sudden
leap in costs should leave him with half a
house on his hands and half a mind to kick
himself for his folly. This is why country
towns are acquiring a wide fringe of shacks,
shanties, plank-and-grass shelters and other
make-shifts that surest a Chinkytown of
the . early gold days, or the death and burial
of civilisation.

POLITICAL
POINTS
From the N. S. Wales Gallery:—
Of course Lang knew his Budget was going to
frighten Israel, but he never reckoned on it scaring
Danny Levy out of the Speaker’s chair. Dan was
thought to be well and truly fixed. The Opposition
had tried to insult him out. The newspapers had
tried to lie him out. Wirepullers and earbiters had
worked overtime to argue him out. Where all these
tacticians failed Lang triumphed—to his own con-
sternation and the horror of Dooley. An hour or
two after details of Lang’s taxation projects reached
the proletariat, Levy began to be troubled about his
conscience. Perhaps a certain amount of pressure
came from the land of Judah. Anyway, the number
of friends calling on Levy expanded suddenly. The
worried look he had worn for a long time became
more worried. There were hurried conferences in
side rooms, much whispering, the solemn winking
of cunning eyes—and on next sitting day the Min-
istry put up a garrulous bore to blither about wild-
dogs for an hour or two and called its crowd out of
the Assembly to learn that it was on the edge of
the precipice. Greg McGirr was the only one of
them to wear a grin. The rest looked as solemn as
owls. Levy’s evacuation was delayed for a day
while Opposition scouts tried to manoeuvre a couple
of Labor men off the premises. These unsavory
“negotiations” breaking down, Levy apologetically
quitted on Thursday with a long speech that was in
the main' an excuse for having taken the job. The
House thus left at a deadlock, with each side equal
in number, adjourned till this week so that the
Ministry might skirmish for a straggler ready to
accept £32 17s. 6d. a week, while the Opposition
posted sentinels in the vicinity of possible deserters.
Some queer work has been going on since then.
Pratten’s passage from the Senate to the
House of Reps, was easy. The capable and am-
bitious little Protectionist won Parramatta
with a majority of 15,143 (just on 4 to 1)
over the Labor man, the-other candidates—
Piddington, the basic-wage lawyer, and Addi-
son, of the Country party —losing their de-
posits. Two years ago Hutchinson, the
Labor nominee, polled 10,205 against
Joseph Cook, but on Saturday his vote
slumped to 5625; in Parramatta town,
where he almost equalled Cook, Pratten beat
him nearly 2 to 1. Which, taken in con-
junction with the crushing defeat of the city
Labor aldermen and the drop of 6000 in the
party majority for West:Sydney, makes the
outlook for the Dooley crowd bleaker than
ever.
Hughes’s half-hearted attempt to amend
the Constitution by the Convention route
expired as miserably as Mrs. Leo Hunter’s
frog. Dr. Earle Page broke out into profes-
sional metaphors about it
The bill was stillborn. It was not premature; be-
cause it was already too long delayed. It was so
congenitally deficient that it could not have lived.
In any case it had been strangled from the moment
of delivery by rough hands.
Less obstetric in his language, Charlton, the
deputy Labor leader, objected to the Conven-
tion as proposed because “the present mem-
bers of the Commonwealth Parliament would
be obliged to stand for election as delegates
if they did not wish to jeopardise their
prospects at the general election, and this
would mean considerable expense.” In a
word, the amendment of the Constitution is
less important for the time being to Charl-
ton and those who think with him than their
convenience as politicians.
The adventurers and others who ran the
municipal government of Sydney for a year
or two in the ill-used names of Labor and
Democracy didn’t show even reasonable dex-
terity at their game. They didn’t succeed
over the Moore-street business, nor in the
matter of the great colliery purchase, nor in
that of the metal-quarry purchase. The
attempt to annex Paddington and use its
Labor vote to give the boys of the old brigade
a permanent hold on Sydney and all its finan-
cial possibilities., failed. The bill to disfran-
chise electors who didn’t support Lambert
lost itself in the Upper House. The city
elections went against them ; and then, just
when there were thoughts of a bill to annul
the elections and restore the old oiligarchy
by the back-stairs. Speaker. Dan Levy re-
signed and made hay of the Dooley Govern-
ment’s majority. And if the bottom falls
out of everything the boys of the old briga<
THE GOOSE-STEP.
“A message from Berlin says that the former Kaiser
has decided to re-marry, and has chosen the widow
of a Danzig officer who was killed in the war.”
may even have to redeem in cash those per-
petual, irredeemable, non-interest-bearing
bonds that they sold under, pressure to
municipal employees to finance the party.
It was a long record of heavy, stupid, inep
bungling.
In the Federal Arbitration Court Justice
Powers refused the request of a terrace of
unions for a 44-hour week, and gave his
reasons—in effect, that when one-twelfth is
knocked off the hours, and .-as much or more
off the production, it doesn’t necessarily
mean that room is made on the job for one-
twelfth more men. When the net profit on
the whole output of a business is 13 per
cent, and output is reduced 121 per cent,
it is barely worth while to continue. It is
merely a case of hanging on in the hope of
better and saner times. If the net profits
are only 10 or 12 per cent, it isn’t worth
while. Nothing could be more obvious, but
the attitude of the new school of leaders is
that if any logic, evidence or arithmetic
gets in the way of a complete idle Saturday
and a long day at the races, so much the
worse for the logic, evidence or arithmetic.
The Governor of little Tasmania and his
devoted subjects have come to an agreement.
His Ex. says he can’t afford to stay because
the pay is too small. The Assembly says it
can’t afford to let
him stay because,
in: these hard
times, the pay is
too large. So
Tas s y thinks of
struggling on with-
out an Ex., and
letting the Chief
Justice, who is him-
self cheap enough in
ail conscience, take
the job in his
stride, so to speak,
with the cocked
hat for sole re-
muneration. Th e
system, or one
very like it, works
well enough in
Canada. If there
isn’t a Judge
handy for the job
and willing to
accept nomination,
as in Quebec, then
some other non-
partisan is found,
as in Albert a,
where Dr. Brett, a
Professor of the Manitoba University, is a
successful Lieut.-Governor.
A change has come over the unemployed
in Bananaland. A few months ago they
were in a state of perpetual simmer. They
used to hold meetings in the Domain, protest
vociferously up in Mt. Morgan, and other
places, and occasionally form themselves into
deputations and march gaily to see the Labor
Premier or one of his Ministers and address
the portfolioed big-wig as “Comrade.”
Occasionally the Comrade would order the
out-of-work orator out of his office or call
in the police to maintain order, and then
the public rocked at the joke. But of late
they have become strangely quiet. The gal-
lant leaders and the fervid orators are no
longer to the fore. Nobody seems to know
what has become of them. Nobody can tell
whether nice little jobs in the prospecting
line have been found for them. All that
anybody can tell is that Cerberus is sud-
denly a dumb dog. But the unemployed are
more numerous than ever and the monthly
bill for relief and doles goes on climbing. So
fresh howls will soon be heard, and then the
whole business of silencing Cerberus will
have to be' gone over again.
Certain members of the Vic. Assemble
having voted against the appoint-
ment of a Public Service Tribunal,
Lemmon, M.L.A., read to the
House the affirmative replies some
of these “noes” had given to a cir-
cular, issued during the election
campaign, asking candidates how
they would vote in the matter of
the Tribunal. In decent society
the changed attitude would have
brought forth explanations and at
least some attempt to show justi-
fication ; but they don’t do things
like that in Parliament. All that
the “yes-noes” did was to accuse
Lemmon of not playing the game.
An assertion was actually made to
the effect that if election promises
were to be flung in the faces of
members in this manner, candidates
would be driven to refuse to reply
to questions during a campaign
other than by word of mouth.
What beautiful morality !
The . House of Ileps. has had one of its
periodical arguments with the Senate as to
whether the Chamber has the right to
“press” for tariff amendments until ex-
hausted nature gives way. It is 19 years
since the question was first raised, and it has
never been decided one way or another.
Always the disputants have compromised
by raising this duty and lowering that,
whereupon the subject was dropped. In
the latest instance the Senate, discovering
that the House was in a distinctly hostile
mood, didn’t “press” so obstinately as usual,
but the contention will be resumed when the
next tariff comes along. It is a row with
rich possibilities of trouble, but trouble is
the Australian politician’s native element.
And it is his ineradicable habit to let things
slide.
Further evidence of casualness in the War
Service Homes administration was revealed 1
by Millen, the Minister in charge, in the
Senate last week. When power had been
given deputy-commissioners to buy suitable
land up to £lOOO, a commissioner had, with-
out the Minister's knowledge, increased the
limit by another £lOOO. But even that had
been exceeded by a deputy in Tasmania, who
had paid £3700 for 54 blocks of an estate
about which the Minister was then inquiring.
And there was the case of the commissioner
who had been ordered not to acquire land “for
requirements beyond a period of 12 months
ahead,” but who “had sent out instructions
to his deputies that land acquisition must be
proceeded with well in advance of require-
ments, and he fixed a minimum period of
three years and a maximum of five.” The
same man had mopped up timber areas and

things were moving along so nicely,

sawmills without Ministerial permission, and
had subsequently closed Several in Queens-
land. But that wasn’t the whole of Mil-
lea’s tale of woe. He related how when
£6,000,000 were allocated for soldiers’ homes,
it was stipulated that only £150,000 should
be spent on existing houses, whereas the bill
had / ultimately amounted to £3,000,000.
Also when recommended purchases amount-
ing to over £5OOO had to be referred to the
Minister, it was customary to avoid worry-
ing the head by chopping up an estate into
sections within the £5OOO limit and buying it
piecemeal.
Put it to the credit of Theodore and
Fihelly that theirs is the first Labor Gov-
ernment to take a stand against the mad
passion for horse-gambling that is dragging
so many city wage-earners down. A move
to establish night-racing in Brisbane found
them resolutely hostile, though differing as
to whether the abomination could be stopped
by regulation or would require a prohibitory
Act. And McCormack, the Home Secre-
tary, said he wasn’t only opposed to the
night abomination but he thought day-
racing should be curtailed. Much of the
prevailing misery and discontent is due to
the habit of risking the contents of the
weekly pay-envelope on broken-winded brutes
that are of no use to God or man. And
many of the Theodore Government’s sins
will be forgiven if, in this instance, it is
as good as its word.
Whitsitt, the Speck’s Independent legis-
lator, leaped up in the Assembly the other
day and demanded that the chairman leave
his perch. Then in a voice like a whip-
cracking duel in a tin barn he smote the Lee
Government, horn, hoof and tail, and de-
clared his intention of sweeping Ministers
out of office. But the astute Premier Lee,
instead of asking for the usual adjournment
to meet the no-confidence challenge, affected
to treat Whitsitt’s splurge as the mere
crackling of thorns beneath a pot, and
ordered the debate to proceed. This move
kept the Labor Opposition in the Chamber
and prevented any caucusing. Finding
themselves thus free of party direction, one
or two of the chief Labor spokesmen rose
to mention that though they had very little
confidence in responsible Ministers they had
less in irresponsible Whitsitts. After that
the storm subsided, and “the crisis” was all
over in half-an-hour.
Humor is a strong feature of the Christ-
mas Bulletin, now on sale (9d.) at the

say supplies one of his inimitable “bear”
pages. Leason pictures a country race meet-
ing, Minns contributes a page of Abos. And

THE IRISH FREE STATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
. Let all the graves of Ireland
Cry this great word to God
Where reverent Freedom dares to stand
Upon the holy sod:
“For all the shames, for all the pain
The vanquished ages knew,
We have not lived and died in vain
Who lived and died for you.”
Oh, fast on this victorious night
I see the legions ride—-
Queen Maev upon a horse of light
By young Cuchulain’s side;
Finn, Oisin, with a thousand spears
Of their Fianna guard,
And Columb, prince of soldier seers,
Anointed priest and bard!
See Brian, with his men of Clare;
And Ruraidh riding fast,
Glad that his country’s first despair
Is numbered with its last.
Close up the ranks. Old foe grown friend
Beneath the flag of green—
They stand for light till darkness end—
The race of Geraldine.
With golden spur and clanging steel, ,
And proud as death and truth,
Come Silken Thomas and O’Neal
In the clean fire of youth.
On Sarsfield’s bit is flying foam —
Oh, proud is he to lead
Ten thousand gallant exiles home
When home is home indeed!
Cheers for the keeper of the trust!
He walks sincere and strong,
His golden fame no blood can rust —-
Great Grattan joins the throng.
And, 10, ’mid ranks that bless his name
And beat of peaceful drums,
Our Dan O’Connell like a flame
Of inspiration comes.
But who are these that fill the air ■
With tingling rapture strong,
And streaming robes and flying hair
And gusts of olden song?
These are our high Danaan kin,
Who rule the wind and fire,
Come back to lead the glory in
Of Ireland’s desire.
Hark! As they pass the silence fills
With music shrill and clear,
Harps murmur on a thousand hills
A song without a tear;
And soul by soul the singers march —
Amergin leads the way—
Beneath the sky’s triumphal arch
To hail the splendid day.
0 ye that kept the faith so well
Through ages dark with pain,
A nation’s solemn voice can tell
Ye did not die in vain ;
For all the graves in Ireland
Have cried alofld to God
Till reverent Freedom dares to stand
Upon a blood-bought sod.
The pact is made ; old foes are friends;
The last black shadow flies;
The battle of the ages ends ;
The ageless rancour dies.
The harvest fields are broad to reap ;
And, by the flag o’erhead,
A nation prays for strength to keep
Its treaty with its dead.

The div. rate goes back to 10 p.c. again, the
10s. bonus of six months ago having been a
“very special matter'’ and a "special excep-
tion” to the recognised dividend policy of tue
directors prompted by “exceptional profits”
—apparent!■>' those harvested from exchanges
during the importing orgy. The abnormal
trading conditions have passed, and the
falling-off of profits by £54,500 is thus ex-
plained. Yet with, the exception of those
of the March half,, latest disclosed profits
were better than for any previous term, and
chairman Mackellar remarks that the figures
disclosed were “after making full provision
for contingencies.” Also £15,000 of the
half’s earnings went to reduce the book
value of premises. The profit claimed by the
accounts was about £90,000 larger than the
pre-war average, but new capital has been
a big help. Paid capital in 1914 was 3J
millions, and it was assisted by £2,590,000
of visible reserves. Shareholders have since
put up a further 14 million, and reserves
have expanded to £3,650,000. Thus mil-
lions more shareholders’ funds have been at
work to give approximately £lBO,OOO addi-
tional profit per annum ; so if the old funds
were earning net no more than in pre-war times
the extra disclosed profits indicate that all
the new capital and reserves are earning
only 7 p.c. Put another way, total funds
are how shown to be earning approximately
i p.c. less than those of the pre-war days.
That means either that the burden of costs
has been heavier than the harvest from
exceptional profit-earning opportunities, or
that the Wales has been regularly storing
large slices of apparent profit to protect its
position should things not' go right. There
is every indication that the extra costs did
not give the bank’s veteran general-manager,
the late John Russell French, much worry,
and that, being a cautions, hard-headed
banker of the old school, he took full advan-
tage of the unusual opportunities to
strengthen all weaker links in the business.
Besides its own additional funds the
Wales has lately had 13| millions more
deposits to play with than in pre-war days.
The amounts held for the public, and the
uses to which the outside cash and the co.’s
own funds have been put, are given in these
comparisons:—

Premises . . 795,000 820,000 800,000
Lately in advances alone 111 millions more
were at work than was the case seven years
ago. Meantime, a much larger proportion
of the bulkier liquid assets have been
interest-earning:—
1914. 1921.

Bank balances . . . . 107,466 1,255,533
£21,779,988 £30,338,068
Thus Gf millions more have gone into Gov-
ernment and municipal securities, or been
put out at short call. Altogether at least
an additional 18 millions of investments
and advances have been helping earnings.
For every £ of the bank’s 1914 funds £5 2s.
was at work earning something ; for every £
of present capital and reserves £5 14s. is
out in a much-dearer money market. In
these circumstances, it is almost certain
that, despite heavier taxation, the bank-
clerks’ union and all other troubles, the
Wales’s funds are yielding a good deal more
than the published accounts admit, and that
the management has not risked labelling
anything like the whole of the margin over
and above exes, as profit actually earned. Con-
ditions, it knows, are still far from normal.
Several recent disturbances have certainly
abated : the adverse trade balance has been
readjusted, the dangerously large stocks have
been unloaded with but few serious casual-
ties, and the enormous advances made by the
banks are declining. At September 30,
including more or less Government-guaran-
teed advances with liquid assets, the Wales
had about 10s. lOd. of every £ of the pub-
lic’s money within easy reach or backed by
Federal or State Governments. There was
12s. 3d. more in the written-down book
values of advances and premises. For . every
£ entrusted to it there were, therefore, vis-
ible supporting assets of 235. Id., besides
which there are internal resources of such
dimensions that, though an unsecured bor-
rower defaults for £lOO,OOO, no mark is left
on figures publicly presented. The Wales’s'
position, therefore, has every appearance of
being very sound.
A feature of the latest B.N.S.W. accounts
was the contraction of deposits by £1,203,000.
The falling-off of deposits in the Common-
wealth over the last quarter was six millions.
The unusual trading conditions were respon-
sible for a big increase previously, and the
easing of those conditions subsequently re-
sulted in a contraction. But these move-
ments attract attention to probable future
happenings. The growth of Australasian
deposits from millions seven years ago
to 289 millions at September 30 last did not
represent so much additional wealth which
had come to the community. It mostly
reflected the straining of cred-it, the financing
of the war by Commonwealth paper, and
the war-time prices got for our produce.
There has been an all-round fall in values
of wool, wheat, metals and other produce.
That means smaller payments which will
flow into the banks and consequently cur-
tailed deposits. This deflation process is in
evidence throughout the world, particularly
in TJ.S.A. —one sound Western State Bank in
February, 3920, held nearly £240 of deposits
for every £lOO it had in 1914; in August of
this year the proportion had declined to £lll.
A similar falling-off is not at all likely in
the Commonwealth ; nevertheless, the poorer
prices are certain to have some influence.
And as the banks can lend only a propor-
tion of what is entrusted to them by the
public, managements nowadays are very
chary in the matter of new advances. In the
circumstances, the banks, which are merely
the caretakers of the public’s loose cash, are
not in a position to finance customers on the
scale of recent years.

In addition to the £11)8,003 of reserves shown
at September 30, 1920, the management now
admits that there was £30,000 among the
liabilities : “as the fullest provision- has been
made for all known and outstanding liabili-
ties the sum of- £30,000 has been transferred
from the contingency account to reserve
fund.” For policy-holders the revealing of
internal reserves is a healthy sign: for share-
holders, it represents the addition of Is. 2d.
per £1 share to their interests. The addition
of a further £30,000 from the past year’s
underwriting surplus took the formal reserve
fund to £lOO,OOO. Paid capital is half a
million, and the balance of P. & L. £7842.
So there are what may be termed share-
holders’ funds of £607,842. There is also,
as a first-line defence for policies, £165.000
in a reserve for unexpired risks, and equal
to 37 p.c. of the past year’s net premiums.
Altogether there are funds totalling £772.842,
or 174 p.c. of latest premium income. That
is very solid backing for policies: the co. has
visible resources capable of satisfying claims
3| times greater than last year's iosses.
Tlie past year was less profitable than any
one of the preceding three. That has been
due chiefly to heavier marine losses. The
underwriting record over many years has
been as follows :

Tremium income last year was nearly half as
large again as it was in 1918, but £ll more
per £lOO of premiums went in claims and
£7 more in exes. So whereas three years
ago 31.7 p.c. of net premiums (<=£97,510) re-
mained in the office, only 13.7 p.c. (=£60,536)
was left last year. Meantime, though, larger
funds and higher interest have taken invest-
ment earnings from £31,383 to £46,141, that
improvement alone representing almost 3 p.c.
on capital. Interest and rent last year
provided all except £16,351 required for the
124 p.c. div., so £44,000 of the £60,500 under-
writing surplus stayed to strengthen re-
serves.
The Queensland Insurance grew very
rapidly. The introductory table goes back
to the time when paid capital was £75,000
and the co. was paying 10 p.c. on it. Paid
capital has since expanded to £500,000, not
one penny of which has been squeezed from
shareholder's, and on it 12i p.c. divs. are
being paid with the greatest ease. For
every £1 of capital 10 years ago shareholders
now get 16s, Bd. each year in divs. It is
an amazing record. Not all the profits have
been won from local underwriting; besides
operating everywhere in the Commonwealth
and Maoriland the co. is nowadays pick r
up business through “agencies at all im-
portant parts and places throughout the
world.” Some of its funds are now in
Indian, Canadian. U.S. and Malayan Gov-
ernment securities. This comparison shows
how assets have grown since 1914 :

Port Swetteniiam did not curtail its tappings
during its latest year as did most other plan-
tations. It apparently had an assured
market for its rubber; so while production
from the two estates was 183,0001 b. against
160,2001 b. for 1920, rubber on hand at June
30 last represented £1032 compared with
£4143 12 months before. The latest valua-
tions were, of course, on a lower-price basis.
But though the co. successfully marketed its
product, prices were so poor that for the
first Time it made a loss on tappings. Pro-
duction and average prices realised over
seven years have been as follows:
Port Average Price
Swettenham. Australasia. Realised per lb.

1915.. 41,270 2 2

1920.. 50,000 110,200 1 11.47
1921.. 68,700 114,600 10J
At the Port Swettenham estate f.o.b. costs,
including all rubber charges, 60 p.c. of gen-
eral charges and depreciation, were got down
to 11.67 d. per lb. last year from 15.27 d. in
1920; at the Australasia estate costs slack-
ened Id. to 10.79 d. So a loss of nearly
per lb. was made on Swettenham production
and id. on the big estate’s output; and an
all-round loss of 4d. per lb. was sustained
after meeting all general and administrative
charges. At present rubber-market pros-
pects continue cheerless, and. there is no
option but to cut exes, to the bone and
thus reduce losses to a minimum, keep the
estates healthy and sit tight in the hope
that the market will improve. There are so
far no indications of a revival, and it is
impossible to make any forecast as to what
demands there will be for the world’s rapidly
increasing rubber output. That is one of
the big troubles: the plantings of the rubber-
boom cos. have been gradually coming into
full bearing, and at the moment there are
no visible outlets for the stuff.
Two years ago paid capital was £57,500.
but as £75,000 or so had gone in acquiring
and developing plantations and in factory
equipment the co. was leaning heavily on
outsiders, despite the profits which had
accumulated. So 20,500 8 p.c. £1 partici-
pating cum. prefs were issued and called to
15s. But the past year’s set-back swept
away the £6487 surplus of liquid assets as
at June, 1920, and gave an excess qf liabili-
ties of £876 at the latest balance. Besides
the year’s operating loss of £3162, liquid
reserves were tapped for £3669 to finance
further developriient.

£ rom J. T. Thompson, general manager of
the Temperance and General:—
The Wild Oat’s” criticism, of this Society’s balance-
sheet (B. 8/12/’2l) was unfair in two respects.
Lnder the guise of an attack on Industrial Insurance
serious reflections are cast on the- management of
this Society: and you over-stated the expense rate
in the Ordinary Department by nearly 2 p.c.
Ihe criticism alleging bad salesmanship in writing
Industrial business in preference to Ordinary business
is based on the proportion of Industrial premium in-
come to total premium income. If this charge be
true it must be laid against all Industrial Ordinary
offices, or at least against all offices which began
business on an Industrial Ordinary basis. Surely
you would not accuse such giant institutions
as the Prudential Insurance Co. of England or its
namesake in America of corrupt salesmanship
because of the proportion of Industrial premiums.
Examine these figures, the latest available:—
_ ,■ Ordinary. Industrial.
T. and G, . . . . 36.6 p.c. 63.4 p.c.
Prudential (England) . . 40 „ 60
Pearl (England).. .. 324 „ 674 „
Prudential (America) . . 41 „ 59' „
Metropolitan (America) 49 „ 51
If the organisation of the T. and G. is directed on
such immoral lines as stated, what have you got to
say about the management oi these companies?
The other charge to which I take exception is the
comment on the Ordinary expense rate, “unusually
high last year,” following on figures showing an in-
crease of £l7 12s. lOd, in 1920 to £2O 4s. 2d. in
1921. As a matter of actual fact this 1921 rate is
only £lB Bs. 3d., a comparatively small rise over
the 1920 rate.
The “Wild Cat” puts on sackcloth and ashes
and confesses that it slipped in the matter of
the expense rate ; a 5 in the tens of thousands
was mistaken for an 0. The cost rate was,
therefore, actually 15s. sd. more than in the
previous year, and £4 18s. 4d. more than six
years ago. But, as The Bulletin exnlaineu.
the higher cost rate in recent years has been
due chiefly to the large number of new
policies written. In the matter of Industrial
assurance The Bulletin did not select the
T. and G. for any special criticism ; on the
contrary, it stated that the over-large amount
of Industrial business written compared with
Ordinary “does not apply only to this office.”
There are at least 10 concerns doing Indus-
trial business in the Commonwealth, and
lately for every one Ordinary policy issued
they have written more than two Industrials.
The T. and G. figures were employed to illus-
trate to insurers how much better thev would
fare in the Ordinary branch, presuming they
are in a position to pay premiums into the
office quarterly. Admittedly, for those un-
able to save the few shillings weekly to pro-
vide quarterly premiums, Industrial insui*-
ance is a boon. But it is unbelievable that
in a nation of savings bank accounts only one
new policy-holder can be found for the Ordi-
nary branch while two are admitted to the
Industrial. The Bulletin’s point is that
many agents do not stress the advantages
of the Ordinary policy, but find it easier to
coax business (and their own commissions!
by pushing Industrial propositions. But
talk of “corrupt salesmanship” and of the
“organisation of the T. and G.” being “on
unmoral lines” is, of course, nonsense. The
Bulletin used no such expressions, and dis-
avows them. Their application to the T. and
G. would be utterly absurd.

fully-paids for its scrap for a term of years.
There are already 3100 contributing shares
fully-paid, and with the £12,500 now being
got in paid capital will be £24,000. “Based
on the Tasmanian cost of hydro-electric
pow r er,” the directors say, “and allowing lib-
erally for all other costs of manufacture,
for depreciation of plant and overhead
charges, and allowing also for having to sell
the product below present prices, a net profit
of £lO per ton, or £lOO per week on a 10-
ton output, is forecasted.” Profits on that
scale would give more than 20 p.c. p.a. on

Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia,
Ltd. —The first accounts are out, accom-
panied by lengthy talks by the directors and
general-manager H. W. Gepp. There is
little of interest in the figures yet, except
that they show how much has been sunk in
the big Derwentside enterprise, the first in
the British Empire to tackle production of
high-grade electrolytic zinc on a large scale.
Three years were spent on investigating
possibilities. Then, towards the end of last
year, the word go was given and £1,100,000
of 8 p.c. cumulative participating prefs. were
issued. At June 30 last paid capital was
41;786,320—£1,436,320 in cash and £350,000
in shares for the Read-Rosebery group of
mines. On the other side, £357,673 represented
Read-Rosebery, £98,677 was in properties and
buildings, £917,411 had been sunk in machin-
ery and plant, £259,962 in stores and fuel,
£160,464 in concentrates and products on
hand, and £213,012 had gone in research and
development. The pref. issue underwriting
and sundry flotation exes, ran away with
£44,611. To get thusfar —other incidentals
took the assets total to £2,222,979 —the co.
at June 30 was leaning on outsiders for
£374,000. But the prefs. were then called
to only 12s. 6d. per share; ss. more
(£275,000) has since been got in, leaving
£137,500 still callable.
The first half of the plant, fed with
15.000 h.p. from the Hydro-Electric, was
got going on Nov. 22. Both the directors’
and Gepp’s reports ante-date that historic
happening. But confidence and optimism
ooze from every paragraph. The “salient
features in regard to prospects” are first
set down by the directors: —
(1) The power contract with the Speck Govern-
ment, which undertakes to deliver 30,000 h.-p. at low
cost for 20 years, with a firm option to the co. for
another 20 years.
(2) An assured supply of concentrates from (a)
the recent purchase, “at a satisfactory figure,” of
750,000 tons, from the British Board of Trade, of
Broken Hill stuff, some of which is now available;
(b) the high-grade Read-Rosebery ores- —figured to
date at over a million tons and “proved amenable
to the process” ; (c) future Barrier production ; and
(d) other Commonwealth sources.
(3) The favorable situation of the works on the
deep-water Derwent for receipt of concentrates and
delivery of finished products.
Manager Gepp talks at length on technical
aspects. When the second half of the plant
is in operation towards the end of next year
he anticipates utilising to full advantage
over 100,000 tons annually of Australian zinc
concentrates, and make available in Australia annu-
ally sulphur gas equivalent to the production from
30,000 tons of sulphur. It will produce 40,000 tons
metallic zinc (99.95 p.c.), 2000 tons to 3000 tons
zinc oxide, and probably at a later date up to
10,000 tons annually of leaded zinc oxide, with
smaller quantities of other by-products.
And despite the unexpected increase of con-
struction and operating costs, Gepp, “in
the light of our experience and of all the
factors to-day governing our cost of produc-
tion and realisation,” is satisfied that “the
expectations upon which this industry was
launched will be realised.”

Riverina Collieries, Ltd.—This is the
co. which proposes to mine the sub-bitumi-
nous coal on the Coorabin field, Southern
Riverina (N.S.W.). The Coorabin Coal Co.
has spent more than £17,000 on exploratory
work, proved 25ft. of coal at the outcrop
and 36ft. four miles away, and developed
the property (a shaft is down 270 ft.) to give
an output of 200 tons per day. In the
23,000 acres which have been acquired, bor-
ing under the supervision of the Mines Dept,
has indicated reserves of 828 million tons.
J. H. Newby, 11. L. Stead and other mining-
engineers are satisfied with the field; and
Newby estimates that the mine can be de-
veloped and equipped to put out 700 tons
in eight hours at a cost not exceeding
£70,000. The coal is certified to be superior
to that from Collie (W.A.) and Wonthaggi
(Vic.). In heat value approximately 22cwt.
Coorabin equals a ton of Lithgow. Analyses
have given moisture 7.8 (bottom), 9.8 (top) ;
volatiles, 29.5, 26.2; fixed carbon, 53, 50.7;
ash, 9.3, 13.3; sulphur, .4, nil.
Nominal capital of Riverina Collieries is
a quarter-million in shares of £1 each. The
public is offered 90,000—the issue has been
underwritten—and the vendor co., Coorabin
Coal, is to get 60,000 shares and £lO.OOO of
the cash put up by the public. The feature
of the float is the location of the mine. The
pit-head is alongside the Rock-Oaklands
branch line and 38 miles from Yarrawohga,
on the Vic. system. Without a connecting
railway the field is 225 miles nearer Vic.
markets than Lithgow is. The colliery is thus
excellently placed to find an outlet for its
black coal, and there is no doubt that the
railways will also be substantial customers.
11. L. Stead, by the way, estimates that the
fuel can be produced at a cost not exceeding
13s. 6d. per ton on waggon, his tally includ-
ing “overhead charges, dividends and sink-
ing fund.”
Tongkah Harbor, after having dug out
14,229 tons tin oxide worth £1,722,159, of
which £615,000 has been distributed in divs.,
had a rough passage during the 12 inonths
to September 30 last. Going back to 1918
performances can be put into this “tabloid” :

One trouble was heaped on another last
year. To begin with, costs went up more
than a penny, partly because of the cost of
renewals and repairs—difficulties in that re-
spect were added to by adverse exchanges
and the poor quality of materials supplied—
and on account of shortage of fuel and the
delay in getting the Nos. 4 and 5 dredges
into the Bangtao area. The former plant
was out Of commission for 5| months and
the No. 5 for months. This was due to
the inconsiderate Siamese Government.
Eliot Lewis had planned to get one dredge
nosing into the new ground and then follow
up with the other plant, thus effecting the
transfer from the Harbor with a minimum
interruption to productive operations. But
the little Siamese delayed the granting of
entry to the area. The negotiations through-
out, says Lewis, were “aggravated by the
Government’s indefiniteness and vacillating
reiteration of every step. The whole of the
circumstances unpleasantly reveal how very
lightly this country regards . the long and
well-sustained operations of the co. in
Puket.” The yardages of the two dredges
while cutting into the Bangtao area have
not been included in the recorded totals,
and that, too, has helped to swell costs per
yd.; on the other hand it kept up the aver-
age of tiff won. Lately the plants have
averaged 21 tons and 38 tons oxide per
month respectively. For the surface rights
of that area £10,500 was paid, and
not only doe's the Siamese Government
exact a stiff duty on production, but the co.
is also obliged to pay royalty to the Bangtao
co. The Tongkah directors have never dis-
closed the royalty terms in published reports
-—it is understood to be 15 p.c.—nor has
it been very clear who are the people in the
Bangtao co. who pocket the royalties. On
paner it looks as though Tongkah’s present
operations are resulting in substantial losses.
Production appears to be at the rate of 60 to
70 tons per month. With tin at £l6B the pro-
duct would fetch about £94 per ton. giving
between £5600 and £6OOO per month after
paying Siamese, but not the Bangtao, royal-
ties. All-in costs for the two years 1920-21
were between £BOOO and £9OOO per month.
Last year’s actual operating loss was
£1263, royalties and administration exes,
increased it to £13,992 and after providing
for depreciation and for spares and work-
men’s insurance, etc., a £26,000 hole was
made in the £118,236 of accumulated
profits on hand last year. Early in
the year, before all the troubles were
sighted, two divs. totalling £30,000 were
paid, so the P. and L. balance is down
to £61,085. Meantime the liquid surplus has
slumped from about £85,000 to £30,400, and
much of that may be swallowed by renewals
—the hulls of two of the dredges, Lewis re-
ports, are “very far gone and require re-
newal to the extent that amounts practically
to re-building.”

Bowes Kelly was in a dour spirit when
he faced Lyeli shareholders last week. The
big man’s heart grieves that Lyeli won’t
pay, even jogging along, and with labor more
efficient than it was a while ago. His in-
clinations plainly are to shut down, but
that involves such heavy maintenance costs
underground that it is a question whether
it is not cheaper to keep going, though ore
reserves are drawn upon. Meantime, Lyell’s
side-lines are easing mining difficulties. Still,
sulphur is a problem. Kelly says negotia-
tions are proceeding with the Electrolytic
Zinc, and that the Mt. Lyeli pyrites are
being re-investigated. Will it cost more to
de-sulphnrise zinc concentrates than to use
the Speck pyrites or crudes? Even though
the answer be fateful to Risdon there can
be only one test, that of cold £ s. d.
'Finding difficulty in inducing the public
into new mining propositions, promoters in
the West have hit upon a novel scheme. It
is being tried in connection with the flota-
tion of the New Golden Mile, alias the old
Lake View South : £25,000 of shares are
offered for subscription, and of this amount
it is proposed to set aside £7OOO for work-
ing capital, and ear-mark a sum sufficient
to purchase 25,000 non-interest-bearing £1
Government bonds which will be redeemed
in 25 ( years. “Therefore,” the prospectus
says, “a subscriber will receive in addition
to shares a Government bond for the full
amount invested.” A new insurance co., the
Australian Probate and General, has lately
been offering shares on similar lines.

schists of great widths, indefinite walls and

There will be almost world-wide mourn-
ing for Sir Arthur Pearson, who slipped
in his bath, stunned himself and was
drowned. No man ever did more to help
other sightless men. And they weren’t
always easily handled. One well-known
Digger’s blindness in England did not
prevent him from drinking' and from “hop-
ping in” if a fight offered ; the way he could
follow round, by sound, a man with whom
he had picked a quarrel was uncanny. His
meeting with Pearson occurred when he was
engaged in an angry argument with an
attendant in a London hall. Pearson came
in with smooth words and the Digger
turned savagely on him. Then somebody
whispered “That’s Sir Arthur Pearson !” Out
flew the Digger’s hand, but not in anger this
time; The two sightless men, facing each
other, “shook.” “And I was nearly plug-
ging him !” said the Digger afterwards.
Kindred with the Hamilton ducal family
was claimed by George Hamilton Dough-
arty, who died at East Melbourne the other
day. He was a cousin of the tenth duke.
He and his late brother, J.G., formerly a

James E. Harris, Earl of Malmesbury, is
mentioned as likely to be the next S. Aus.
cocked hat. His ancestor, the first earl,
was the man whom George 111. sent to Ger-
many to convey Caroline of Brunswick to
the arms of the Worst Gentleman in Europe.
In his “Diary” Malmesbury records that the
lady’s father told him she wasn’t exactly
a fool, but she lacked judgment and needed
looking after. So true was this, in more
xespects than one, that the diarist found it
necessary to give her daily lectures “on the
toilette, on cleanliness, and on delicacy in
speaking.” Thus admonished, the Princess
had a bath, brushed her teeth and put on a
new smock, but this is what happened when
she was ushered into the Presence:—
The Prince raised her gracefully enough and
embraced her ; said barely one word ; turned round ;
letired to a distant part of the apartment, and,
calling me to him, said, “Harris, 1 am riot well ;
pi ay get me a glass of brandy.” I recommended
water.. Exclaiming “No,” with an oath, he rushed
away to the Queen. The Princess was in a state of
astonishment and inquired, “Is the Prince always
like that 1” ■
Those were the days.

(iN.te. \\ .), the last surviving son of William
ot Kelso, has gone west at 94. He
was born on the Bathurst plains, where his
father had settled in 1821. There were
three daughters and six sons in that family
—Oeorge (Leeholme), John (Bylong)
•James (Larras Lake), William (Wood-
lands), Henry (Kelso'' and Edward, a bar-
rister, the only one not a grazier and stock-

The Oldest Inhabitant”: Uy memory
of just-dead Melbourne journalist Her-
bert Palmer goes
back to the early
’6o’s, when he be-
came a member of
the Garrick Club,
at about the same
time that Marcus
Clarke joined.
Years later he as-
t o n i s h e'd his
friends by appear-
ing at his office
and in the courts
in the red shirt of
the Salvation
Army. There
never was a milder-
mannered man ; his
voice scarcely ever
got beyond a
whisper, and he
was never known
to lose his temper,
so serious a view
did he take of his
responsibilities and
of the need of self-
discipline.
MAT. CHARL-
TON, leader of the
Federal Labor
party in the con-
tinued absence of
Frank Tudor
through ill-health.
The new Gaud Mayor of Sydney. Aid.
W. P. McElhone, is son of that John McEl-
hone who used to represent the Upper Hunter
in the Assembly and made many a lively
scene in the House. The first mayoral R.C.
was H. McDermott (1846); the. next was
Dan Egan (1853) ; then, after a big break,
W. P. Manning (1891-94) and'Tom Hughes
(1902), the last of the Mayors and the first
Lord Mayor. The next of the same faith
was Dick Meagher (1916), and then John
English (1919), who died in office. Lam-
bert may have been an R.C. Lord Mayor
too; but the chances are he isn’t very sure
what he is.
With the death of Mrs. Robert McGregor
finis was written to an undertaking unique
in Postal-Department history since Federa-
tion. Mrs. McGregor was the wife of a
Vic. M.L.A. of the ’BQ’s, and on the death
of her husband was “given” the Geelong
West post office by the State Government,
then controlling the service. The Common-
wealth took over the obligation with the De-
partment. Such offices, workable enough in
small centres, inevitably become “family
affairs” in which the semi-official is “as-
sisted” in the conduct of the office by friends
and relatives not official at all. Geelong
West, a town of some 11,000 people, grew
restless under the arrangement: so did the
Department. But it lasted until the old
lady’s death.
“Michael Mulligatawny” holds a review:
The Northern Ireland Cabinet, now so much in the
spotlight, is not a» collection of Belfast’s super-
business men. The Big 1 Brain is Finance-Minister 11.
M. Pollock, a Belfast nierchant. The job fits him
like a glove, and none in North-East Ulster is more
qualified to control finance. When he was chairman
of the Harbor Commissioners the port of Belfast
made rapid strides and became the chief shipbuild-
ing centre of the world. Premier James Craig, a
local distiller, steps into the shoes Carson was ex-
pected to fill, merely on the son-of-his-father prin-
oiple. Physically a big man, he is painfully mediocre,
thinks in platitudes and speaks in italics. His
duties as D.A.A.G. of the Ulster Division earned him
a baronetcy, but didn’t take him nearer the war
zohe than Westminster. Home Affairs-Minister Daw-
son Bates was secretary of Carson’s 1914 provisional
Government, and is a capable organiser. He didn’t
leave Belfast for the Big Scrap. Of the others Lord
Londonderry, Lord O’Neill and E. M. Archdale,
Minister for Agriculture, are of the absentee-landlord
type, and have as little in common with the Ulster
working-man as Tom Henley has with Archbishop
Mannix. The only R.C. in the administration is
Denis Henry, Chief Justice .and (that rara avis') an
Irish Catholic Unionist.
With the sudden passing of John Ilopore
Wharewiti Uru, the M.L. House of Reps, lost
its best-liked native member. He was born
at Canterbury in 1868, educated at Te Aute
and first elected to the House at the by-
election in 1918 caused by the death of
Charles Batata. Uru was a great worker
for the Maoris, and for years was secretary
and representative among the chiefs who
met regularly to thresh out laws. He was
sergeant of the Maori contingent to the Dia-
mond Jubilee in 1897; in 1901 he com-
manded the Maoris at the opening of the
Commonwealth Parliament at Melbourne,
an( 1902 added color to the coronation
of King Edward. He made an effort to get
into the scrap with the Hun, but—he was
over 21 stone. A great field-games athlete,
he represented Canterbury at cricket and
football, won the M.L. wrestling champion-
ship, and was the only man to throw
Donald Dinnie when that braw person
toured M.L.
Archie Strong, who goes to Adelaide ’Var-
sity to the chair of English, is probably the
only Australian professor whosp father was
one before him. His dad taught classics at
Melbourne Uni. when the State was a good
deal younger.
Premier Barwell (S.A.) finds that he
can t go to London without a secretary, and
Sincock.gets the job. He graduated on local
papers in the South-East, and worked up
to Adelaide Advertiser, becoming eventually
Government shorthand writer and director
of the Reporting Department. He has been
secretary to all sorts of commissions, and
editor of the local Journal oe Agriculture.
The Kirk in Victoria is mourning Hume
Robertson, who went out with the tide the
other morning. He fulfilled nearly ail the
bright hopes raised regarding him 35 years
ago, when, as a brilliant youth of 25, he
attracted notice at Mia Mia and Castle-
maine. Latterly he was at Brighton Beach.
TMever very robust, four years’ chaplaincy
with the Billjims told on him, and he had
been very puirly for months.
It now looks as if a successor to Hood.
J., who retires from Vic. Supreme Court
Bench, on Dec. 31, will be appointed as from
Feb. 1 because there is so much business
backed up apd waiting. Speaker Mackey is
said to still have hopes. He narrowly missed
appointment when J. M. Davies refused and
Cussen was selected. With the exception
of two, in respect to whom some risks were
taken, the Lawson team has been lucky in
its appointments. No Government for 30
years has had so much patronage to hand out.
“T. 0.1.” : Norman Kite, of a family estab-
lished on the Macquarie River (N.S.W.)
nearly a century ago, has passed out at 50.
The original Thomas Kite kept the first inn
of note in the Bathurst district, the Dun
Cow, and died very wealthy. A daughter
married George Lee, of Leeholme, Bathurst,
and became the mother of Ida Lee (Mrs. C.
B. Marriott, the historian). A son, William
Kite, of Kelso, pioneered coursing in the
West and lost money at it. The old Club
House Hotel, with the pine-trees, which stood
on the corner of Castlereagh and Hunter
streets, Sydney, was Kite’s property. In
his will he ordained that the site should
never be let for more than seven years. In
boom-time an offer for a 20-years’ lease was
made, with a good building covenant, and the
late Tom Slattery engineered a bill through
the House to allow acceptance of the offer.
But the boom burst and nothing came of it
then. The solid pile of the Blashki build-
ings now rears itself on the site.
Two pillars of the one-time large German
population of Grafton (N.S.W.) have gone
—the old German church, sold at public
auction; and its last remaining trustee,
Thomas Englert. The latter, who was born
near Wertheim in 1837, came to Australia
at 21, and w r as one of the pioneers of the
Clarence River. Six of his grandsons were
on the winning side in the war.
Died at Haling, Burradoo (N.S.W.),
Zilla, eldest surviving daughter of the late
Isaac Nathan, in her 87th year. Her father-,
who set Byron’s Hebrew melodies to music,
was a distinguished composer and teacher,
and was appointed musical historian to
George IV. and instructor to Princess Char-
lotte of Wales. lie came to Sydney in 1841.
A son was the late Dr. Charles Nathan, of
Macquarie-street. and a daughter married
Dr. Foulis, of Sydney. A grand-daughter
became the wife of the late Dr. MacLaurin,
Chancellor of Sydney ’Varsity.
Aid. J. IT. Gardiner, of Melbourne City
Council, died last week, aged 73. Always
identified with North Melbourne, he twice
tried to speak for that suburb in the Assem-
bly. but i'rendergast carried too many guns.
In municipal politics he did much better.
A prominent footballer in his youth, the few
ancients who remember his feats still talk
of his kick as something of which this de-
generate age knows nothing.
Lewis Cohen, taking his sent for the
eighth time as Mayor of Adelaide, asked a
gathering of citizens
to drink in silence the
health of Col. Light,
founder of the city.
The silver bowl used
was presented in 1859
by people in London
with interests in S.
Ans., and they had
the extraordinary
courage—f or that
period—to stipulate
that “colonia 1"
wine must be
used for the pur-
pos e. Cohen an-
nounces that the en-
largement of the Town
Hall will be a feature
of bis policy. Th e
main hall remains as
planned in 1863, but
seems to have , shrunk
horribly in the 58
years.
JOE COOK, Aus-
tralia's new High
Commissioner.
The N. S. Wales branch of the British
Astronomical Assoc, is celebrating “the foun-
dation of astronomy in Australia” by a visit
to Parramatta (N.S.W.), where in 1821
Governor Thos. Brisbane equipped an
observatory. But his was not the first
observatory. Lieut. Dawes, of the First
Fleet, was established in one by Governor
Phillip. It was at Dawes Point, and was
named Maskeleyne, after the then Astro-
nomer Royal of Britain.
“Iona” recalls something in the life of
the Sydney chemist who gave instructions
to the I.W.W. in “fire-dope”
One Sunday afternoon in 1905 three of us investi-
gated the mine of an old hattel- at Picnic Bay, on
Magnetic Island (N.Q.), and on returning to the'sur-
face Harry Scully discovered he had left his pipe
below. A proposal; to lower him down per bucket
and windlass was accepted, but his head had not
reached surface-level when the whole contraption
broke away and pitched down the shaft. When we
went down to gather up ScuUy’s remains we were
saluted with “That was a blankv fine joke to play
on a man!” Striking a match we found Scully
seated on the bottom, one leg in the bucket and the
other out, with a cut over the right eyebrow his sole
apparent damage. The windlass had jambed across
the shaft about two-thirds of the way down. Scully
insisted he was all right, climbed the 7-2 ft. of vertical
ladder unassisted, arid walked unaided nearly 400
yards to the water’s edge, where he collapsed, and we
had to lift him into the boat (La Cigale). He was
duly landed in Townsville hospital, but was back at
work on Friday morning, when he told me he was
utterly unconscious of everything from entering the
bucket till waking from a heavy sleep on Wednesday
afternoon, though he had. chattered considerably in
the interim, and was apparently normal. What bear-
ing it may have had on his later career is another
matter, but to those who knew the good-natured,
laughter-loving- Harry Scully of the old days his part
in the Sydney I.W.W. cases came as a bewildering
surprise.
Otago (M.L.) Times has just celebrated
its diamond jubilee. It first went to press
111 1801 at Dunedin, and was the first daily
published in the Dominion. Julius Vogel
was the first editor; another of the eight
■who have reigned was R. E. Twopenny,
keorge Fenwick had the longest rule (1890-
1909), and is now managing director; he
has been on the staff right through. Charles
Iraser (editor Otago Witness) has been
m the office 52 years, and nine others have
had over 40 years’ service.
Looking at the thin figure of Speaker John-
son of the Reps, it is hard to believe that
he was once an A.B. and for a number of
years roamed in South America, where he fili-
bustered in the war between Chile and Peru.
For some time he has not been in robust
health, and it only needs an all-night sitting
to show that> his reserve of strength is not
very great. On both sides of the House he
is popular, because he preserves a rigid im-
partiality and decorum. His dedisions are
never questioned, and the House, in liis seem-
ingly frail grasp, is generally a Sunday-school.
He has, of course, had “scenes,” but he has
never shirked the responsibility of quelling
any offender, however high his position—as
Joe Cook can testify. A quiet, lonely man
these days, he divides his admiration between
bowls and water-colors. He acquired the lat-
ter art -when working as a scene-painter in
Sydney.
THE HUTS BESIDE THE ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They are mostly far from the nearest town,
They are mostly low and grey,
And they seldom see a stranger’s frown
Out Back o’ Sunset way.
But men whose mate is the roving wind
And a restless soul their goad,
Will stay awhile and a welcome find
In the huts beside the road.
They are kindly folk of the gaunt wide ways
Where the huts are grey and low,
But it’s few they see through the lonely days,
For it’s few the stark plains know ;
A prodigal comes from the fields of swine
Who gathers the crop he sowed,
But forgets the husks where kind eyes shine
In the huts beside the road.
There are warm hand-shakes and words that greet
Where the lonely grey huts stand,
For those who wander with blistered feet
On the tracks of the gaunt wide land ;
And the broken men who flee from shame
And are bowed with their heavy load
•Will sit and smoke and w'ill hear no bla.ne
In the huts beside the road.
It’s hunger that makes the rough bread sweet
Where the huts are low and grey,
And a man may drink and a man may eat
With never a score to pay;
For whether he come to them soon or late
They practise the old bush code,
And the man who comes is hailed as mate
In the huts beside the road.
TASMANIA.

We had a bullock-driver working for us, and he
had with him his wife and six children. He and his
two eldest boys were away
loading wool at the shed,
which is 29 miles from vvhere
the family was camped. There
was nobody else anywhere
near them; so when baby,
aged 13 months, fell into a
basin of boiling fat, badly
scalding its back, the mother
could see no way out but to
carry the little sufferer to the
homestead. Next morning, at
5 o’clock, she set out with the
baby, a little girl of five,
another of seven and a boy
of nine. God knows how
they did it in the heat; but
they had covered 28 of those
interminable miles before
they were seen, being then
within a mile of the wool-
shed. They were driven to
the homestead, where the
little baby was attended to
and the other mites put to
bed. The nine-year-old boy
was as heroic as his mother.
He couldn’t manage to carry
his little sister of five very
far, but for the latter part of
the journey he had put his
belt round her and was drag-
ging her along. Out here we
are used to exhibitions of endurance and couragie;
but this one can surely take its place among the
most remarkable of them.
“McNorth” : The resignation of the Gover-
nor of S. Aus. because he can’t make a do
of things on his screw led me to unearth the
letter I received from Molama Komo, the
constable of a village westward of Hall
Sound (Papua). It was written in Motuan
on the back of a large “Government Notice,”
and, trahslated, ran :
Dear Taubada, —News has come to me that your boat
is anchored at Hall Sound, and as you are my old friend
I want you to speak to the Governor for me when you
go to Port Moresby. I want to be Village Constable
no longer. 1 want to leave. But not because it is
a bad job. It is good t.o be Village Constable.
Many men like the job, for the people are afraid of
him who is Village Constable, and the Government
pays him one pound a year. One pound a year for
doing nothing! You plrase tell the Governor, sir,
that plenty men are ready to take my place. Oh, it
is good to be Village Constable; but I can stop no
longer. I \i;ant to leave. For my wife is dead.
She died of a fever sickness one month ago. And
now the soreness of my heart is finished and I want
ake another wife. But the father of her whom I
want asks many things in payment for his daughter
Many things, sir. I must sro away and work on the
white man’s plantations to get the money to buy
the many things. Maybe the Governor would be
angry with me if I sent him a letter; so I ask jou
t0 ° speak for me . Tell the Governor,, sir, that I must
g 0 aw ay to get the many things wherewith to buy
my new wife. For a man cannot buy a wife with
wages of one pound a year. Farewell. Molam

I am sure it will be consolation to Sir Arcln-
bald to know that there have been others
who, like him, have not been able to afford
greatness.

“Spare Corp.”: Snowy got his D.C.M.
after taking the most amazing series of risks
—risks that made it look as though he was
deliberately trying to get a knock. But when
he returned to us after leave he showed a
tendency to avoid anything more than lie
had to do of necessity, and he com-
plained bitterly at times. “They can
have their daihned D.C.M.’s,” he said —“a
bloke’s unlucky to get it. They expect him
to do all sorts of things they don’t ask
of other fellows.” Some of his cobbers asked
him the reason for the change in him.
“Well,” explained Snowy, “I went out after
the D.C.M. because I needed it. I was to
the bad in me pay-book and I wanted the
20 quid to put me right.” A. bonus of that
amount, of course, goes with the medal.

ing up, a big girl appeared with a bottle, a
spoon, the infant of the family and this
message: “Mum says, will you please give
baby a dose of oil; he’s sick, and he won’t
take it for us?”

“H.S.”: Beautiful Bilgola, near Newport
(N.S.W.), where the late Colonel Oswald
Watt lost his life some months ago, was
sold at auction last week for £4500. It is
a fine example of the activities of unearned
increment. The late W. B. Dailey originally
bought the whole of the land from the top
of the mountain at the back to the beach
for £lOO. When he died it was literally
given away : Mrs. McGaw, who bought the
castle at Manly, found that the executors
had thrown in “the Farm.” as Dailey called
Bilgola. One of the Hills lived there for
some years, ahd then Jones, the brother of
the caretaker who found Watt’s body, got it
for about £3OO. He built Iflhiself _ a house
on the mountain-side of the Barrenjoey-road
and sold the other half of the estate to Watt
for £lOOO. The bungalow stands exactly
as it did when Dailey had it built to his
own designs: the tiles of the fireplace, repre-
sen mg scenes from the Waverley novels,
weie put in by him; and the immense urns
in which pelargoniums were'once grown are
decorated with rough casts of his friends
lai Kes, Martin and Robertson. The only
improvements done by Colonel Watt were to
the garden, which he was planting with
shrubs to the day of his death.
Bluti : The child’s definition of faith as
“believihg something we know isn’t true”
was called to mind the other day when an
earnest young lady of my acquaintance told
her Sunday scholars the story of the waters
of the Red Sea being heaped on either side
to make a crossing for the Israelites. There
was an impressive silence till one small
urchin asked, “Are they still heaped up?”
Ihe teacher s gratification at the interest
of her class crashed when a red-headed boy
gasped : “Oh, the mug—he believes it!”
* * # *
“Big Ack”: Whenever I feel particularly
cheerful on a wet Sunday I unearth a sheaf
of letters of sympathy belonging to my dad.
They condole with him on my being killed
in France in 1916. One from' an old friend
of the family always tickles me. He hopes
we are all quite well as it leaves him at pre-
sent, is sorry to hear of such a fine young
man going west, regrets that the poley heifer
he bought from dad has a blind teat, and
suggests that £1 of the purchase money be
refunded.

“X2X” : A man can still take refuge from
civilisation on the north-western coast of
New Guinea, probably the most-thinly popu-
lated littoral in the world. Here and there
along it is to be found a queer character
whom the dreadful solitude doesn’t seem to
worry. Not far from the Dutch border is
one whom rumor alleges to be a member of
a noble English house, while, until a few
years ago, there lived in a native village
close to loma a man who once possessed con-
siderable European fame as a surgeon. But
the strangest of all was a dweller close to
Morobe. Just before the war he was visited
by a high official whom a fast cruiser had
brought from Germany. The object of the
visit never transpired, but the hermit was
variously stated to be half-a-dozen different
people ranging from the Archduke John of
Austria to a former German officer who had
acted as the scapegoat for the sins of one
of the Kaiser’s sons. Soon afterwards he
left the territory, and he has never been
heard of in those parts since. None of these
TACTLESS REMARK.
MAUDE : “By the way , grandfather, you
needn't have been so rough on poor Mr.
Sonnet .”
GRAN'PA: “How do you mean?"
MAUDE : “Well — er—you said there was only
one Shakspeare, you know!"
odd characters ever seemed to be short of
money, and one or two of them showed obvi-
ous signs of possessing large quantities of
the root of evil.
FAITH.
[For The Bulletin.]
Came from the sky a mighty thing.
I saw the chickens black an* white
Run nestling ’neath the old hen’s wing
As fell the roaring meteorite.

(Continued on page 18.)
AS IN THE BEGINNING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I picture him a simple man,
Addicted probably to hair,
And freckles, and a coat of tan.
The barber gave him not a care,
Nor had he thoughts about the fair,
Till from his rib they turned a shady
But tolerable maiden lady.
I think of Adam when his Eve
Came pottering about the cave
Already clever to deceive.
He viewed her daily, none too brave,
And sitting at a distance gave
To his delightful near relation
A deal of shy consideration.
He wondered at her eyes and thought
“They’re blue as sky is.’’ Like the rose
He found her lips. Her teeth w 7 ere white —
As little sea pearls, I suppose.
Her neck reminded him of snows.
Comparisons he found each weed in
Among the glowing beds of Eden.
Her ears were pink shells from the sea,
Her hair was- like the silk new-spun.
“Her darker lashes are,” said he,
“Like tall reeds dipping from the sun.”
In fact, before his task was done
He had exhausted every token,
And left no flattery unspoken.
And she upon a flowery bed
Entwined with elfish coquetry
Red blooms about her golden head.
Then with the famous Snake, K.C.,
Took counsel. “I want life,” said she.
And he, the subject’s core to grapple,
Made haste advising “Try an apple.”
How 7 Adam bent to the appeal,
How he was pipped, his children know.
I see the guilty couple steal
Forth from their Paradise in woe;
And Eve is saying as they go
To hapless Adam (sadly mute he),
“A pretty mess you’re made, you beauty!"
VICTORIA.

Make it an
Electrical Xmas!
The advent of electricity in the home
has established a new regime for the house-
wife. Her work is now done more easily and
better, in half the time, by the many labor-
saving devices electricity makes possible.
Washing day-is stripped of its dread—the
Electric Washer shoulders all the work ; and
the Electric Iron saves weary steps to hot stoves.
Smooth-running Electric Vacuum Cleaners
make short work of "sweeping up,” and take
the place of the old-fashioned broom that
merely scattered dust. But above all, the boon
of Electric Light—instant and plentiful, when-
ever and wherever she wants it—is hers for the
turn of a switch. And so also with sewing,cook-
ing, dish-washing, and the rest. She makes elec-
tricity do the work, and gains time to herself.
"But,” you say, "we have no electric current
in our house.” The G-E Home Light and
Power Unit was specially designed to overcome
this difficulty, and is supplying electricity in
thousands of homes to-day. Let it do the
same for you ! Abolish drudgery in your
home from this very Christmas !
Let us show you how to obtain, easily and eco-
nomically, the comfort, convenience and saving
of time and money that follow the use of the
A-G-E Electric Service. A post card will bring
you full particulars by return post Write now

“X2X” : A while ago a colleague called me
in to assist him in a minor surgical operation
on a young man, the anaesthetic being a local
one, injected into the arm just above the part
to be operated on. From the beginning .the
patient showed extreme nervousness and,
imagining he was being hurt when he
could feel nothing at all, writhed in the best
imitation of agony I’ve seen. Finally, we
had to give it best and wait until he was in
a less nervous condition, simply because we
could not get him to keep still long enough
for us to do anything to him. After he had
left I inquired casually who he was, and the
•eply gave me a shock. A few years ago Aus-
tralia rang with his name, because of the
amazing exploit which had earned him the
Y.C. in France.
* * * #
“Morob”: “Hamer’s” would-be suicide (B.
1/12/’2l), whom Fate finally despatched
herself, recalls the ca.-e of “Stringer” Jones,
who, years ago, was a resident of a N. S.
Wales country town. Things financial and
domestic having reached a crisis he decided
to take the easiest road out. The method
selected was to throw himself in front of
the mail-train so that his death might be
put down to accident; but “Stringer’s” nerve
failed, and he fled. Then he tried to blow
out his brains, but when he pulled the trig-
ger of a cheap revolver it failed to go off.
Annoyed at his bad luck, he took a length of
rope to the bridge at the back of the town-
ship. Fastening one end of the rope around
his neck and the other to one of the beams
he climbed through an opening and dropped.
It was no good—this time the rope broke
and he fell into the river. Then Fate, dis-
gusted by his clumsiness, took a hand.
“Stringer’s” clothes caught on the branches
of a semi-submerged tree and the stream
dragged him under and drowned him.

“Kopai”: Private schools are turning a
neat trick upon Tate, Vic. Director of
Education. Standardiser, systemist and de-
voted Australian, Tate does not disguise his
small opinion of the swank-aspiring public
schools compared with,those of his creation.
HIS MISTAKE.
YOUNG HUSBAND : “ Darling , I don't think
much of the cake you left for me!”
SITTO WIFE: “That shows what you know
about it! Why, the cookery-book says
it’s delicious.”
Faddist, however, as well as systemiser, he
has also introduced Americanised spelling as
a preliminary to more Americanising. Out-
standing among the innovations are “pro-
gram” and “center.” The result is that,
democrat and standardiser though he is, Tate
is actually emphasising a class-consciousness
he disapproves, and is establishing it in
black and white in every document issued by
the hand of youth or maiden. If he or she
spell centre “center” State-school scholar is
betokened; if the old way, public school. A
trifle, perhaps; but far-reaching. Most
employers of staffs, having had parents able
to spare 10s. a week for their schooling, are
public-school men, and will have a leaning
towards those similarly trained. Yet every
written communication to them, every appli.-
cation for job or advancement, if it contain
the word “programme” or “centre” will
A DEVOURING PASSION.
“I believe I could love a poor man for himselj alone.”
“You never DID have any love to speak of, Dolly. Now, as for myself, no one man could
possibly be rich enough to buy all the wealth of MY affection.”
brand the writer at once as educated on a
plane the recipient sub-consciously will
regard as inferior. Vic. schools are now
turning out by the thousand boys and girls
branded as though with a tar-mark. And
there is the probability soon that another
batch will be going out stamped “traveler,”
“defense” and “thru.”
* * * *
“Spare Corp.” : The Diggers didn’t usually
run to soulful, reportable sayings when they
were hit; but the things some of them said
were heroic all the same. “Never
mind me,” said one pip artist as
he flopped and a couple of men
showed a tendency to pull up and
look after him; “cut in like hell
and get the blanky job over!” I
think the last words of a sergeant
of our platoon were as valiant as
any. He had got a machine-gun
bullet through the groin, and was
doubled up with pain, but he
gasped: “There’s some rum in my
water-bottle —give it to the boys
when you get back.” We were
having a rough night, and his
dying thought was of the benefit
that rum would be to those of us who pulled
through.
* * # #
“Rapa-iti”: In his time Prof. Macmillan
Brown, of M.L., has spun some remarkable
theories about the origin and history of the
Polynesians. Now he is off in the Chilian
training-vessel General Baquedano to see
what evidence he can dig out on Easter
Island, the most eastern of the Polynesians.
Apart from the mystery of the huge stone
statues there, this remote specklet (about
150,000 acres, or big enough for a nice little
sheep-run, which is indeed what it is mostly
used for nowadays) had an indigenous sys-
tem of writing which was practised down
to 1863, when the Peruvian blackbirders car-
ried away the leading professors of the art
to slave on the guano islands and to die in
exile. Two British investigators, Scoresby
Iloutledge and his wife, overhauled the island
a few years ago. They decided the statues
were carved bv the ancestors of the ’ resent
inhabitants, and that the art was still active
when Roggeveen discovered the specklet in
1722, though it died out shortly afterwards
for reasons not now evident. As to the writ-
ing, there still lingered one old man, a
leper, who knew something of it.
“Moe”: It takes some nerve for a hangee
to joke on the scaffold, yet there are in-
stances of it. About the neatest occurred
years ago in a N. S. Wales .country
gaol, where no execution had ever taken
place previously. The authorities had im-
provised a gallows with a ricketty set of
steps leading up to the platform. When the
procession, with the chaplain, principal actor
and gaol governor, reached the foot of the
steps there was a halt occasioned by the
condemned coming to a. stop. Silently the
governor motioned to him to ascend. After
a long, critical look at the wobbly stairs he
asked, “Wot? Up them things? Gor’ blime,
they ain’t safe. A man might fall and break
’is blanky neck!”
w * * *
“Sierra”: I once earned a crust on a cray-
fishing schooner in Bass Straits. Old
Portuguese Tom was owner and skipper,
and lie had a great name for niety. If the
crays didn’t climb into the pots as rapidly
as he thought they should, he always went
through a quaint religious ceremony. In
the evening he would tie a dead crayfish to
the signal halliards and slowly hoist it to
the masthead. Then, as the sun dipped into
the horizon, he would bare his head and say
reverentially : “O Lord, der’s Dy supper; in
mercy senda me my breka-fast.”
* * * *
“Percy Pawnticket”: One more example
of casual matrimony was afforded in the
recent Divorce-Court story of a pair who
started matrimonial bliss as a working
“married couple.” They met for the first
time in the vicinity of a Sydney labor
registry office, and an “M.C.” job being the
most attractive of the billets offering, the
man proposed on the spot. The registry-
keeper told them that the employers insisted
upon a production of marriage-lines, so they
promptly went and got married. They
honeymooned on their new job; but love’s
young dream changed to a nightmare, and
a few months later the bridegroom threw
in his end of the contract and disappeared.
* * * -X-
-“Ali Selim” : The Digger’s psychology was
curious. A man from our battalion, a big,
quiet, sober fellow with an excellent record,
one day in the Strand saw two redcaps try-
ing to lumber an exceedingly drunk and vio-
lent Canadian. Bill, stone sober, hopped
in on behalf of the drunk; and an Australian
Provost Corps man, a redcap and a civil
John eventually landed him in the cells at
Warwick-square. Everybody concerned was
badly damaged. The court-martial gave old
William the comparatively light sentence of
28 days’ detention, which the confirming
authority commuted to 28 days’ loss of pay,
in consideration of Bill’s blameless past and
good service in the field. The big chap took
it much to heart. “Yes,” he said, “a man’s
a blanky mug to go and spoil a good-conduct
sheet after three years with the old bat-
talion ; but what hurts is that it was all over
a blanky Canadian, and I never did have
any time for those blankards!”
“Jobber”: Would you call it coincidence?
A gunner I knew in the Royal Artillery was
blown up early in the war, landed on his
head, and was blind for four months. He
went back to his unit, and in less than three
weeks precisely the game thing happened him
again. He was in hospital with me after
the second spin, and was gradually getting
his sight back when I left for home. The
Armistice had been signed then, and this
killed his chances for the hat-trick.
“Chris”: Fate carries a heavy hammer.
In India lately a Maorilander and his chum
went down with fever at the same time. The
chum shed his earthly shell. The sur-
vivor’s bride-elect came along, and two days
later was carved up for appendicitis, dying
under the anaesthetic. Two days more and
the poor devil had a cable that his sister-in-
law-to-be had been thrown off a horse in
Australia and killed. His cup of woe,
already brimming, overflowed when he learnt
within the month that his mother had died.
* * * *
“M. 0.”: “Tauwarra” (B. 1/12/’2l) on
Papuan names reminds me of the joke per-
petrated in the Kumusi district by a patrol-
officer who had to take a sort of periodical
census of each village. After he had been
transferred his successor set about the job.
Beginning with the ladies the first one sur-
prised him by giving the name of a promi-
nent actress. So did the next, and all the
others that followed, until the p.-o. began to
wonder if a theatrical co. had ever been
stranded there. When he started on the men
he found they were all named after race-
horses or politicians. Inquiries elicited that
the previous holder of the job had had no
ear for the native dialect, and had hit on
the brilliant idea of bestowing upon the nigs,
names which could be more easily remem-
bered. To this day Joe Cook and Billy
Hughes figure on the records of the district.
* * * «
“Gregor” sniffs a little
According to the Age the exploration party led by
Dr. Campbell Brown into the interior of former
German New Guinea had some “exciting experiences”
with the natives in the Ramu River district, where
their launch stuck on a mudbank, and they were
forced to make their peace with the nigs, by presents
of beads and other trade goods. As one who knows
the Ramu from its mouth to its rise I find it hard
to guess where the exciting experiences would come
in. The natives in that district are about the tamest
and most sophisticated in the Territory, and, besides,
for years past they have been accustomed to visits
from traders, recruiters and even missionaries. So
CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER GASES.
ADAM : “If I were to die you'd remember.
bow good I’d been to you.”
EVE: “I suppose I would in that case.”
the “explorers” would be no novelty to them.
Twenty years ago the Germans pacified this district
in their own way and it has been quiet ever since—
so peaceable, in fact, that even a patrol officer seldom
pays it a visit.
DECEMBER DAWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The dawn was a delicate gem
On the rosy brown throat of the day.
The lily was white on the stem
And the beat of my heart was gay.
I heard a bird chirp as I sang:
“Carol up! Carol up, happy soul!”
The leaves of the flannel-flowers rang
With a “Heigh!” little “Ho!” to my troll.
I came where the Christmas-bush blushed
On the lyrical ledge of a fall;
Oh, maidenly modest, she flushed
At the sound of my tremulous call.
And maidenly shy as a bride,
By the snowy, soft tea-trees ablow,
December, the white one, I spied,
All aflower from the tip to the toe.

“Eddyson”: The Wesleyan chapel at Tam
stood on an abrupt hill overlooking the township
just beyond the creek. One night, after a severe
storm, the face of the hill slid away into the creek,
leaving the place perched precariously on the rise,
about one-third of its stumps dangling in mid-air.
Two or three sturdy Cousin Jacks put in a couple
of stays, and the congregation trusted to Providence
for the rest. Then, on a Sunday morning, during
Sunday-school, an unexpected storm struck the edi-
fice, and set it swinging. Brother Jacker, recog-
nising the imminence of a catastrophe, suspended
class-work, and started to pray. Brother Jacker
was a tremendous exhorter, Now it was him and
the storm for it. Jacker prayed, and the winds blew.
The good brother was praying for the chapel; the
storm was bent on demolishing it. Higher and
higher rose the voice of the supplicant wrestling
with the forces of Heaven; louder and louder raged
the elements. Purple in the face, pounding the form
before him with both hands, screaming his plea at
the top of his pitch, Brother Jacker prayed and
prayed, unconscious of the fact that, save for him-
self, the church was empty, every other man, woman
and child having fled. Then with a crash the old
wooden building went over before the wind, and
lay a mass of wreckage in the creek. The party
that rushed to the rescue discovered' Brother Jacker
climbing up through a hole that had once been a
window. Sitting on the sill, he put up reverent
hands. “Loord,” he groaned, “you win!”
“Jackeroo”: For the information of
“1.G.8.” (B. 10/11/’2l) and others who desire to
murder the crow cheaply and surely. Dissolve
Hulle’s soluble strychnine in white vinegar and boil
it afterwards in dripping. Spread the dripping on
skins hung on fences or tree-branches in the paddock,
or insert it in the crow’s fancy parts of a carcase.
Use a wax matchbox lid of strychnine to IHb. of
dripping. I have used this method for 18 years with
success.

“Gadgett”: If “Caley” (B. 10/11/’2l)
expects to get a sure cure for sore shoulders on
working horse 3 he will probably be disappointed. A
cure of any sort must be given a chance. He should
see that the collar fits, then with a hammer pound
a slight depression into the part that comes over
the sore in order to relieve the pressure. Then he
should get some mutton suet, melt it down and
apply it hot (not boiling) as often as practicable.
(It will probably make a mess of the collar-lining,
but so will any ointment.)
* * * *
“Invalid” : I rode over to the neighboring
cow-cocky’s place one evening and met two bare-
footed kids coming from the cow-bails laden with
milk. “Aren’t you afraid of the cows treading on
your bare feet?” I asked. “No fear of that, Mister,”
said one. “We always keep our feet in the bucket!”
“Maski”: A word on the “Thou shalt
nots” of our. nig. friends in the New Territory—
lately German New Guinea. The
tambo system is interesting and
at times astonishing. A man
may not fight his wife’s brother —
he is tambo against him. A woman
must cover her head when in the
presence of her husband’s rela-
tions, though not —as would seem
more necessary in most cases —•
her face. If a man dies his rela-
tions may not kai-kai taro until
after the “feast of the dead” has
taken place. In some cases cer-
tain foods are made tambo; and
that may be a source of great
annoyance to the plantation man-
ager. The other day I was told
my “boys” were tambo against
the only food I had on hand—
two tons of sac-sac. A “big old-
fella man” was said to have put
tambo, in the shape of a long-
necked pigeon, on the trees from
which the sago was made, being
under the impression that they
had been stolen from him. I held
a court, at which the “big old-
fella man” appeared wearing the
brim of a straw hat and a sheep-
ish air, and accompanied by a
friend, who stated quite frankly
that- the old gentleman was “a
little long-long” and had forgot-
ten having sold the trees. The
matter was settled by lining up
the labor while the old man and
his friend stood on the verandah
and chewed the sac-sac in front
of them. They then broke off pieces and threw them
to the “boys.” Since this sacrament I have had no
trouble.
“Jim Carew”: “Airey” (B. 24/11/’2l)
contradicts me about spur-wing plovers carrying
their young across water, and puts forward the
ridiculous yarn about young plovers swimming. The
plover isn’t web-footed. And it is one of our
shyest birds (except at breeding-time, when it will
attack anything), yet “Airey” talks of his “mob
of sheep forcing them into the water.” The plovers,
when they first heard the sheep approaching, would
make a bee-line for shelter, and would probably be
half-a-mile away before the animals reached the spot.
* * * *
“Jobber”: “Ganesha” asks (B. 10/11/’2)
where dinkum axemen are to be found outside a
show-ring. Before I enlisted I spent many years
in the Mittagong ranges (N.S.W.) and there were
several there who made “Douglas” fairly whistle. I
recall Ernie Stewart, Dick Ratcliffe and Jack Mul-
lally, all of whom spent their lives in the big timber,
and would take some wiping out. There were also
two women who used to cut and draw wood to the
local mill; they had a dray each, and were no mugs
with the axe.
“Janus”: “Med” (B. 10/11/’2l) needn’t
go to U.S.A. for a mother with two children of
different periods of development. In 1918 a S. Aus.
woman gave birth to a healthy son, and about six
weeks later she became very ill and died. A post-
mortem disclosed a seven-months foetus.
ALL THE FAULT OF THE LAW.
“Fancy a big strapping fellow like you asking for money! You should be ashamed of
yourself.”
“I am, mum. But I once got twelve months for taking it without asking.”
“T. Ash”: “H.V.E.” (B. 29/9/’2l ) evi-
dently hasn’t seen the superb king-parrot of N.E.Vie.,
or he would have given it first place among his four
most beautiful of Australian parrots. The green leek
of Riverina is a bonser in his bright leaf-green coat,
with orange throat, but the bird known in N.E. Vic.
as the green leek is short, thick, smoked-green—and
a devil in the orchards. The “Murray smoker” is a
showy chap in early spring, but his colors fade when
hot weather arrives.
* * •» *
“L. Le Dam” : Re “Tom Mot” and his
insanitary cows (B. 17/11/’2l). A cure is easy but
entails some trouble. The great secret is to take
the milk-producers quietly. Have a receiving-yard
between the general mustering'-yard and the bails.
Drive the cosv into that and leave her for awhile.
The looked-for event will probably happen there,
and then’s the time to catch her.
If it doesn’t happen, turn her round
the yard a few times. After awhile
it becomes a habit for evacuation to
take place in the receiving-yard.
Never take a stick to the ladies, and
forget that you have boots on. Any
excitement, and the game's up. I
have known a strange dog, or even a
strange man about the bail, to excite
a cow just enough to cause her tc
forget her manners. If the animal
has sore teats or has just calved,
more than ordinary care must be
taken. Most people won’t go to the
trouble of training their stock in
good manners, but it pays; for, be-
sides eliminating - the customary odors,
etc-., from the bails, it is reflected
in the cream cheque. Incidentally,
there - are two dairymen in this (Tenterfield,
N.S.W.) district who will bet 5 to 1 they can
milk their dairy cows every morning and afternoon
of the week without a misbehavior in the bails, and
they have milked as many as 60 at a sitting.
* * * *
“The Wanderer” : Has anyone ever heard
of fresh-water eels tackling a dog ? In Dingo
Creek (N.S.W.) the other day a full-grown dog
belonging to Bob Lewis, of Wingham, was swim-
ming, when a big eel grabbed its leg. The dog
was getting the worst of the bout when Lewis went
to its rescue. The mark of the eel’s teeth were visible
for days after. John Weir McPherson, of Dingo
Creek, used to lay baits for dingoes along the
watercourse, and once a huge eel took the bait
during the night instead of a dingo and was unable
to regain the water.
“A.E.S.”: I have a sure remedy for
“Caley’s” horses (B. 10/11/’2l) that he has to
work with sore shoulders. Ordinary sores are pro-
longed and increased by the use of hard, dirty col-
lars, which tear off the scabs formed and with them
the tender flesh that Nature is trying to grow.
Three minutes and a drop of hot soapy water will
remedy that. Keep a bottle of castor oil and a tin
of dry sulphur in the stable, and a few minutes
before putting on the collar. pour some castor oil
on the dry scab, dabbing it well over with the
fingers, especially round the margin of the scab.
When the collar comes off the sore will be found
clean and healthy-looking. Then put on some dry
sulphur in the same way.
* * « *
“D.F.”: Perhaps the finest bit of long-
distance rowing in Australia was done some years
ago by the Finn brothers, piners on the Gordon
River, on the west coast of the Speck.. One of them
gashed hig leg badly, and his three brothers rowed
him, in their piners’ boat, the 50 miles to Strahan
without a stop.
THE SPOILS OF VICTORY.
GEANDMAMMA : “Good gracious, child!
You’re wet through! How ever did you
get in such a state?”
GEORFE: “I couldn’t help it, grandma.
Freddie and I were playing at who could
lean farthest over the wharf, and I
won.”
“Tarago”: The best thing I know to pre-
vent the raids of that bush Hun, the blowfly, is a
bunch of elder-berry leaves. This hung up in the
room, tent or meatsafe will beat off any fly that ever
blew. Ants are not too keen on the leaves either.

THE CONCERTINA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s patched with brown paper and mended with
string,
It’s wheezy and not quite in tune,
While some keys are boneless and some have no
spring,
And critics its tone would impugn;
When first it was bought from the time-payment men
It was polished and silvered and gay.
But wide are the roads it has known since then,
Wide roads and side roads far travelled since then,
At the dance or the wedding to play.
When camp-fires were lighted and under the stars
Men sat in the warmth and the shine,
It has thrilled to the player and struck up the bars
Of “Swanee” and “Sweet Clementine.”
It has chanted of battle and whispered of home,
And lilted of laughter and love;
It has sounded the tramp song where prodigals roam,
Tramp songs and camp songs where wanderers roam,
■Whose tent is the wide sky above.
It has lifted the hymns in the out-away church
When organs and choirs wei'e unknown;
It has sung with prospectors and joined in the search
For the gold that is deep-veined in stone ;
In feasting and folly, in dancing and play,
At shanty and sheep-shed and bar,
Its notes have been ringing the melodies gay,
Ringing and singing the melodies gay,
That time cannot wither nor mar.
Oh, the banjo is fitted with gut that will rot,
And the fiddle’s not easy to learn ;
Pianos are heavy and hard to be got,
And the mouth-organ most people spurn ;
So the old concertina is bush-music’s king,
And when it is broken—why, then
Just patch with brown paper and mend it with
string,
FOUR O'CLOCK CONFIDENCES.
“That Mrs. Pricklyback’s husband is going
to the bad as fast as his fins will carry
him. He’s drinking like a man lately.”
“Yes, and he's always rubber-necking round
the ladies’ baths.”
Patch it and catch it with paper and string,
And it sounds out its music again!
Track songs and pack songs and out-away back songs,
The old concertina again!
Played for the dancing where bright eyes are glanc-
ing,
Ringing and singing where cattle are stringing,
Wheezing and vamping where bushmen are camping,
The old concertina again!

“Jimsey”: Every summer someone wants
to know how to keep flies and stinging insects away
from horses. Here is an infallible plan. Get one
ounce of pennyroyal; add to one pint of olive oil or
. _ ,
rape ml ; shake well together. Sponge a horse over
lightly with this mixture and no insect, will worry
it for nearly 24 hours. The mixture will not hurt
ai me in any way.
A RUDE INTERRUPTION.
VOICE DROM OUTSIDE: “Billy, what 're 'ee
yoin' tell God about that firewood you
prigged from me?"
“Heeagtis”: Now that the stinging-tree
disturbance is ended, will some Samaritan, scribe or
Pharisee give us a cure for that scourge of N.Q.,
scrub itch? The devil which causes the irritation is
a minute red tick or louse, and buries itself under
the .skin, causing agony. I defy the most hardened
to desist from scratching the .affected parts until
blood trickles.
“Settler”: Tell “Caley” (B. 10/11/’2l)
that no ointment will cure sore shoulders in horses
while they are working so quickly as ordinary black-
lead. Get a penny packet, and dust it on the sores
and on the collars where they rub. This will stop
friction, and therefore pain, and allow the sore to
heal. If the collars still rub, see a saddler.
“Saw It”: “Goodie” (B. 8/11/*2l) runs
second with his black snake measuring 84 inches.
Some years ago in Yarram (Vic.) one James Lowe,
in passing an eel-infested swamp, saw a great dis-
turbance among the eels. He hit the disturbing
element with a stick, and it uncoiled to the extent
of Bft. 2in. of black snake. The skin was on show
for some time in an auctioneer’s office in the town,
and is now in the possession of the local doctor.
“Jorne”: Tell “Caley” (B. 10/11/’2l),
who wants a cure for sore shoulders on horses whilst
working, to take the leather of an old boot and roast
it until it is easily powdered, mix into a fairly stiff
paste with tallow or any fat that contains no salt
and apply (not too generously). This is better than
many high-priced remedies.
* * * *
“Te W.” : Gno of the rarest of Australian
marsupials, the banded
ant-eater (Myrmeco-
bins fasciatus), in-
habits, so far as is
known, Westralia and
S. Aus. only. This
animal, which some-
what resembles the
smellful native cat
( Dasyurus ), has no
less than 52 sharp
teeth, and is there-
fore an unpleasant
subject to handle. It
was first discovered by
Lieut. Dale, of Liver-
pool, nearly a century
ago, about 90 miles
south-east of the
Swan River (W.A.).
Two were seen and
one was captured.
T here were many
white-ant (termite)
mounds in the local-
ity where the marsu-
pia 1 s were found.
The native-cat, by the
way, is also a whale
on beetles, grubs and
other insects, and does
not subsist on birds,
carrion and flesh diet
alone. The last
native-cat I saw, on
the far South Coast
of N.S.W., lay dead
on the bank of a
river where poison
had been strewn for
rabbits. On Monaro,
too, the dasyure is now practically extinct.

“G.L.W.” : All argument as to memory in
animals comes to a full stop. In Memoriam notice
from the Adelaide Register (24/11/’2l)
Blank. —In loving memory of our dear mother,
who passed away on the 24th November, 1919.
God took you from this weary world,
And gave you peace and rest.
—lnserted by Harry and Mabel Blank, .
9 Cows, 7 Calves and 1 Bull.

“Sir Speir’: The term “Joe,” mentioned by
“Jim Carew” (B. 17/11/’2l), was first used on the
Vic. goldfields as an alarm to fellow-diggers that the
troopers were approaching in search of men mining
without a license. Originally it conveyed no insult,
and was probably chosen because it made a good
“carrying’’ sound when the alarm was to be spread
throughout the settlement, just as a military order
is passed along the line. Later on the term was
used when an undesirable person entered the camp.
If the word “Joe” was passed when such a one
appeared it signified that all self-respecting diggers
should have no truck with him, and probably out of
this custom arose the strong resentment to being-
greeted with the appellation.
* -* * *
“Temora” : Re “Colub” (B. 27/10/’2l) on
bush superstitions dying hard. In many cases so-
called bush superstitions are the result of keen
observation. One October, some years ago in N.S.W.,
a mate of mine was bitten on the forearm by a black,
red-bellied snake. A ligature was applied, the bite
was opened with a razor, and the wound sucked,
after which a very strong solution of permanganate
of potash was applied, with the result that the
patient recovered. Now comes the aftermath, and.
let “Colub” call it superstition if he likes. I was
mate for two years with the bitten man, and each
year in October he was laid up for three or four
days—he was too honest a mate to be a malingerer.
* # * *
“Country Ped”: “D.F.” reckons there is
strong evidence against the spur of the male platypus
being poisonous (B. 10/11/’2l), and to get that
strong evidence he harks back to a Dr. George Ben-
nett’s experiments in 1831. Well, Mrs. Ped. posi-
tively asserts that about eight years ago, in
attempting to free a platypus caught on a fishing-
line, her brother received a jab from the spur which
resulted in a badly-poisoned hand.
“Dido”: When Pilling came from Hetty-
watty on a holiday he boarded with the Morans,
next to Price, and Price’s jealousy began. Pilling
was a large man, with big hands and feet and fero-
cious ogre's whiskers, and Price was a small, round
man with no punch in either hand, and brief in the
matter of wind. Mrs. Price was young and pretty.
Consequently when Price discovered Pilling with
his red, hirsute countenance topping the dividing-
fence, as he often did, he put his own construction
on the matter, and wished he weighed a ton. Price
had purchased a bitch, a red-and-brown tyke, to
ward off intruders, and it was his fond hope that
the animal would fly up and worry Pilling’s plain
face when he was peering over the palings, or bite
his nose one of these times when he was spying at
a crack; but Juno seemed to take quite kindly to
the man from Hettywatty, and made no demonstra-
tion of any sort. One Sunday Price, finding Pilling’s
head hung over his fence, cut loose, and said he
wouldn’t have it. He got very red in the face say-
ing this, and he said very little else, but he said it
often. Pilling only grinned, whereat Price put up
a yell, and threw a hunk of firewood. It was Mrs.
Moran who met Price coming from business and
delivered the grim news. “He’s gone,” she said.
“Pilling’s gone, and he’s took her with him. I
knew he would when he once got set on her.”
“Taken her with him!” yelled Price as he tore
open the gate and rushed in. His wife was not at
home, but there was an envelope tacked to the
washhouse door. The envelope contained two £1
notes and a few words: “I’ve took her. She went
willin’. I see she wasn’t use to you. I’m givin’
you 40 bob, which I reckon is what she’s honestly
worth.” While Price was sitting clawing his hair
in blind amazement his wife came in from the
butcher’s. “What do you think, George?” she said.
“Mrs. Moran tells me that that wretched Pilling
has gone and taken our dog!”
* * # *
“T. Ash”: “Caley” asks how to cure
horses of sore shoulders while working (B.
10/11/’2l). Mix slacked lime with lard (60 per
cent, lime, 40 per cent, lard), and apply at lunch
and knock-off. But why not prevent sores by bath-
ing the shoulders with alum for a few days before
ploughing? Dissolve a piece of alum the size of an
egg in a pint of water and slap a little on with a
piece of rag twice a day. If the nag is prone to
chafe easily double a bran-bag length ways and
pad the ends for about 15 inches with flock, kapok
or curled hair out of an old collar, stitching through
to keep the padding in place. Use this pad under
the collar for a week or so or until the shoulders
harden.
* * * *
“Bxul”: “C. Coral” (B. 3/11/’2l) wants
to know the sex of ginger cats. Darwin in his
“Descent of Man” states that with rare exceptions
“it is the female alone in cats which is tortoise-
shell, the corresponding color in the male being
rusty-red.” Our tom-cat is ginger, and he had a
brother of the same hue and three tortoise-shell
sisters. His mother was like her daughters. His
ginger predecessor was also a gentleman. Another
curious fact about cats, according to A. R. Wallace,
is that white, blue-eyed male cats are generally
deaf. “I will be deafer than the blue-eyed cat,” says
Tennyson in “The Holy Grail.”
*-*■**
“Warrawong”: “F.C.L.” (B. 27/10/'2l)
is wrong and “H.D.A.” (B. 8/9/’2l) is right about
citrus-trees raised from seeds without budding. When
“H.D.A.” found that out of his 200 seeds planted
only six came to anything, he was experiencing a
little of the law of reversion. No matter how confi-
dent “F.C.L.” may be about his seedlings, if he
follows it out far enough by planting seeds of his
present seedlings, he will find they will revert
closer to their ancestors with all their faults. By
selecting buds from trees of known value and work-
ing these on to seedlings of about two years’ growth,
there is a. better chance of building up a profitable
orchard. Grafting is practically out of date except
in the case of a tree badly hit by frost, and budding
is now the only method of propagation. The advan-
tages of budded trees in comparison with seedlings
are: (1) ability to bear fruit at an earlier age;
(2) uniformity in size and quality of fruit; (3)
having stocks suitable to soil; (4) avoidance of mal-
di-goma and other diseases by using resistant stocks.
Probably “F.C.L.’s” contention in favor of seedlings
is due to the fact that in Q. the worked or budded
trees had as a stock the common lemon, wheteas
experience has shown that the sour-orange stock
is much more successful. Some marvellous seedling
orange-trees in Tahiti, equalling those quoted by
“F.C.L.” as growing in Malta, were non-existent
when we looked for them at Papeete, which makes
THE WINNING COLOR.
“What yer want ter ’it me for when I give
yer best?”
“Well, yer ain’t bloodstained yet.”
me ask to be shown those Malta trees. After samp-
ling- oranges from Florida, California, Tahiti and Aus-
tralia, the writer gives the prize to the Washington
Navel from Renmark or Waikerie (S.A.), which is
a budded tree on a sour-orange stock. No wonder
they topped the market in London this year, beating
Californian and South African fruit hands down.
THE OLD MAN SPEAKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s true I spend my time alone
Beside the fire the livelong day ;
It’s true I’ve fancies of my own,
As my grandchildren say.
I hardly see or hear the things
That lie around. I hardly know
What’s real or not, My memory clings
To scenes gone long ago.
Like shadow-shapes across the gloom
Strange thoughts are flitting through my mind;
And sometimes pictures fill the room
When I pull down the blind.
The living world grows dim, remote,
Eiiipty and dull the house; and I,
Thinking, nor hear nor heed a note
Of all that’s passing by.
The young folk laugh, and go their ways,
I light my pipe, and listen till
The voices of the Early Days
Seem all about me still;
White ships come sailing down the bay
When waves are glancing blue and bright;
And eyes flash brighter than the day—
The Golden Land’s in sight!
Then bold adventurers swoop, down,
Men who would build the world anew;
This Melbourne is a lively town
In fbaring ’fifty-two.
Chinese with pigtails fill the street,
Anti sailOr-ir.en with fancy curls;
And green-veiled diggers down to meet
The bold-eyed dancing girls.-
We see a team o’ bullocks jog
Wi’ jangling bells through forest lanes.
The drivers cursing stump and log.
There’s not a tree remains.
With eyeglass raised, a seedy swell,
From breaking stones and raising dust,
' Stares round (who lately paced Pall Mall)
In wonder and disgust.
The regiment steps into sight
(Bushranging days are not yet done) ;
The. troopers’ bayonets, polished bright,
Are sparkling in the sun.
And Jim the Parson’s there to preach ;
While shouting crowds swarm round to see
Black Donald make his dying speech
Upon the gallows-tree.
The Early Days lie far behind.
I’m crazed, maybe, and growing old,
To mumble, wandering in my mind,
Of days of youth and gold.
But I see; white tents, row on row.
With heavy load the slow dray starts,
And we’re away to Bendigo
With wild, exultant hearts.
The axes ring, the cradles rock,
From all the world the lads come fast;
It’s golden stream, it’s golden rock,
The Golden Land at last!
SO THOUGHTLESS OF HER.
MRS. GEORGE PECK: “ G-George , there's a man under the b-bed!"
MR. GEORGE PECK: “ Let him stay there. Good Lord, woman , you don't expect me to
make room for him in here!"
And oh the songs the diggers raise!
The shanty shakes with heavy heels,
While Pat, the old blind fiddler, plays
His Irish jigs and reels!
The Early Days lie far behind.
I’m crazed, maybe, and growing old,
To mumble so. But well 1 mind
Those days of youth and gold.
VICTORIA.

The Test of Tests
THE GREAT VICTORIAN
ALPINE TRIAL promoted by the
Royal Automobile Club of Victoria
tested out the merits of men,
machines and tyres to a degree
never previously experienced in this
part of the world, and the story of
this great 1000 miles run will be
retold for many months to come
in motoring circles. The trial
furnished iri a remarkable way
evidence of the capability and in-
genuity of the drivers, the wonder-
ful dependability of the modern
motor car, and last, but riot least,
demonstrated that the present-day
DUNLOP
TYRES
are capable of withstanding a
terrific gruelling, and came through
showing little evidence of what
that 1000 miles masked. The ma-
chines were set a severe task, but
their work, strenuous as it was, was,
nothing to that asked of the tyres.
Only those who went through the trial can
realise what the tyres withstood, and even
they are amazed that fabric and rubber
could stand such a test, give so little trouble
and show so little signs of a terrific task ac-
complished. Seventeen of the contestants
who finished used DUNLOP TYRES and it
is certain none of them regret their choice.
It was a wonderful demonstration
of Dunlop quality and dependability.
In fact, it was a triumph for
AUSTRALIA’S PREMIER TYRE
The same quality and service
is at the call of all motorists.

The Rose in the Wilderness
u_ pt/r RS DESPARD,” announced the
|f | maid. For the minute the name
was unfamiliar; then, as a very
perfectly-tailored girl came into the room, I
laughed.
“Why, Ruth, I was just wondering who
the stranger was. I always forget my
friends’ married names. Tea, Marie, and
hot, buttered toast. Well, how goes ijt,
Ruth?”
The firelight flickered on a pretty face
that was momentarily hardened in rather a
worried look.
“Fairly well,” she said, as she loosened
her furs. “Fact is, I’ve come to say good-
bye. I’ve had a cable from David, and he
wants me to go over to Canada to him on
the next boat. Of course, I’ll love to see
him again, but it’s all rather uprooting isn’t
it? I have never lived on a ranch in my
life, and I think I shall be rather homesick
at first.”
I sympathised, and we talked for some
time. Then she said: “You know I’m rather
worried about the frivolous problem of keep-
ing my looks. David told me that what first
attracted him was the fact that I looked so
different from most Canadian women. But
under Canadian conditions, shall I be able
to keep it up? For example, I have my hair
washed and waved at a hairdresser’s every
fortnight; that will be impossible in my
new life. And I look hideous with straight
hair.”
“Why, that’s easily solved: take over a
supply of silmerine with you. You only
want to damp your hair with it slightly and
put in slides or a curler or two, which can
easily be concealed under a boudoir-cap. Get
your hair accustomed to silmerine treatment
on the voyage over; then by the time you
land it will probably have developed a dis-
tinct natural tendency to curl, and will only
occasionally need damping. Of course, it
is much better for the hair than to sap all
its gloss and vitality with hot irons. For a
home shampoo I think you cannot beat stal-
lax. A teaspoonful of stallax granules to a
cup of hot water will make the most deli-
cious foaming lather, which cleanses the
hair splendidly. You’ll be able to dry it in
the sun in no time in that gorgeous climate.
If I were you, I should always keep some
reliable tonic in the house, for you never
know when your hair may require a little
stimulating. Yes, boranium and bay rum
is excellent: I always use it. Also, I think
it would be a very wise plan to keep some
tammalite by you ; dark hair like yours has
a very disconcerting habit of turning grey
in patches. If your hair does show a ten-
dency to fade, you have only to dissolve two
ounces of tammalite tn three ounces of bay
rum, and you have a wonderful hair-restorer
ready for use.”
“Why, that seems too good to be true!”
exclaimed Ruth. “I must write that down.
Now, Estelle, I’m going to worry you some
more. What kind of complexion-cream
should I take? I want something that lasts,
that doesn’t take up much room, and, above
all, that really does keep one’s skin in con-
dition,”
“The answer to the riddle is mercolised
wax,” I replied. A tin such as chemists
usually sell lasts for three or four months; it
is solid, compact and not wasteful to use,
and it’s the finest complexion-beautifier there
is. Its great merit is that instead of making
the skin dull by clogging the pores with
grease, as too many face-creams do, it gently
absorbs the dull, outer tissue which gets
coarsened by hard water, dirt and so on, and
reveals the dazzling freshness of the new
skin below. Of course, in a hot climate,
where the sun and dust tend to ruin even
the prettiest skins, it will be simply invalu-
able. I’ll give you another useful tip: be
sure to provide yourself with some tablets
of stymol; then, if you happen to have a
blackhead, you have only to melt one tablet
in a little warm water, bathe the blackhead,
and you will be able to remove it without
the slightest difficulty, with a clean towel.”
“Thanks so much. I’m sure I shall be as
grateful to you when I’m so far away. Of
course, I shan’t need powder, because since
I discovered cleminite I haven’t needed it.”
“No, you couldn’t do better than carry
on with cleminite,” I assured her. “I can’t
think why more women don’t give up the
old-fashioned messy powder and use that
nice lotion instead. Well, Ruth, I think
you’ll blossom in the desert all right, if you
are wise and take care of your looks.”
“I hope I’ll be able to,” she said, “be-
cause however much one loves adventures
and roughing it, I don’t want to become a
masculine-looking woman. After all, David
liked me as he found me, and it’s up to me
to try and stay the same.”
“I must go,” she said, rising. “I don’t in
the least want to, but there are so many
people to see. Will you come and see me
off? I sail on Friday fortnight. Good-bye.”
“Good-bye, Ruth, and the very best of
luck to you both. Write to me, won’t you?
Good-bye.”— Advt.

in One Length.
This illustration, drawn from a
photograph, shows a DICK’S
Balata Conveyor Belt which was
recently supplied for service in
the Potash Mines of Alsace. The
belt, which is 3009 ft. long x 24in.
wide x 8-ply, is believed to be the
largest belt in the world made and
supplied for service in one length.
DICK’S Original Balata Belting is
invariably specified where conveyor
belts are required for use in Mines,
Metal Quarries and other large indus-
trial concerns. Its great tensile
strength, unique toughness and rugged
wearing qualities, makes DICK’S the
world’s premier conveyor belt for ser-
vice under light or heavy service.

members of all staffs and their still more numerous
clerks. The distribution was performed according
to wisely-appointed rules. Of each batch of deco-
rations G.H.Q. took one-half for its own members
and passed on the other half to the Army Staffs.
The Army Staffs kept half of what they received
and passed on the remainder to the Corps Staffs.
The same method was applied right down to the
Battalion Staffs, and it will readily be observed
(with the help of an elementary arithmetical calcu-
lation) that the likelihood of the men in the line
ever receiving a foreign decoration was practically
non-existent.

Bramble, “and his partner left it to him at the

J. B. D.
A Jester with Genius
Parody’s parent wore the motley ; but she
herself has made friends with the Muses and
paid visits to Parnassus. She has a merry
eye and a naughty ankle. A seductive little
creature in her cap and bells, she looks down
on her low-born sisters Burlesque and Trav-
esty, who can only mutilate their victims
with a meat-axe. Thofigh Parody has a
sharp tongue few poets have been able to
resist her. Byron knew her in Italy and
Swinburne laid bon-bons at her feet. Owen
Seaman met her in the Poets’ Corner and
Beerbohm succumbed to her blandishments.
She seduced J. C. Squire before he left
school. She put her pretty arms round his
neck and cajoled him, so that he affected
a monocle and mimicked the mannerisms
of his contemporaries. He was painfully
conscious of this, and perhaps a little
ashamed, when he called his book “essays
in a not wholly admirable art.” But Parody
clung to him until he was forced to confess:
Now am I a tin whistle
Through which God blows :
And I wish I were a trumpet,
But why God only knows.
The War cured his affectations, but the
world still remembers his liaison and likes
him for it. His “Tricks of the Trade,”
despite the disarming candor of the dedi-
cation, are more than tricks—more than
mockeries enriched by laughter. True, with
such easy targets as Masefield and Newbolt
he scores a bull’s-eye in every verse; but
the majority are caricatures catching the
temper of the original in a touch of truth:
they are criticisms of the poet’s technique
and mental vision. Max Beerbohm, the
Prince of Parodists, accomplished the feat
of parodying a host of living writers on the
single subject of Christmas. Squire goes
a step further when, tired of burlesquing the
trivialities of Belloc and watching the oede-
matous Chesterton jump the Thames bridges,
he succeeds in making Henry James write
the Catechism and Wordsworth “The Ever-
lasting Mercy,” while the intangible Tagore
spins cobwebs round a childish verse from
Blake, and Byron sets the chaste music of
“Morte d’Arthur” to the ragtime rhythm of
Don Juan. Ingenuity could go no farther;
so Squire sat dowm to share the laurels with
his seducer.
People in England speak now of J. C.
Squire as “the literary man of the hour” as
if he combined the critical prose proclivities
of Pater with the lyric qualities of a laure-
ate. Certainly this reputation rests on a
broad foundation, as for several years he
has had each of ten fingers in a separate
literary pie. After Cambridge in the halcyon
days with Rupert Brooke he passed to
“Hansard” work at the House of Commons,
wrote a book on William the Slient, and,
during the war, “The Survival of the
Fittest,” one of the brightest satires which
that soul-deadening calamity brought forth.
Ithuriel’s spear pokes out between such
naked lines as :—•
Tompkins, these died. What need is there to mention
Anything more? What argument could give
A more conclusive proof of your contention ?
Tompkins, these died, and men like you still live.
Being a reject from the army, Squire
joined the New Age and subsequently passed
from the editorship of the New Statesman
to that of the London Mercury, which he
was instrumental in founding; at the same
time, with phenomenal energy, supplying
weekly causeries, comments and literary-
letters for English and American journals.
These essays, which he evidently has on tap,
have been collected into three volumes
called “Books in General.” They range
from the Prime Minister as a verslibrist to
hymnology and guide-books on invective.
As a serious poet Squire commenced his
career in the conventional way by publish-
ing adolescent verses of a conventional
pattern, with daringly innocent translations
from Baudelaire. Like his friend Flecker,
he bowed the knee to the exotic opulence
of the Frenchman’s fancies only to become
lost in the mists of eloquence. But in “The
Three Hills” (1913) he sought extended
range. He struck many chords on his new
lyre, and in the marriage of rich harmonies
and subtle progressions explored fresh reaches
in the realms of music. The Parnassian
influence had palled w r hen, in his later works,
he forsook the marble majesty of the Tenny-
sonian tradition; and being a prosodist of
great learning he made new moulds into
which he poured his “Restaurant Ode,”
“Artemis Altera” and the sonnet “I shall
make beauty out of many things.” Then
came. “The Lily of Malud,” a kaleidoscopic
creation offering new combinations of beauty
with each reading. go far he has only
touched hands with beauty : with the Lily’s
advent he embraced her, and passed the line
dividing talent from genius, the true singer
from the accomplished amateur.
. Three years ago Squire called round to see
himself and set about weeding his garden.
The result was “Poems: First Series,” a
garland of lotus blossoms embodying the
haunting hunger of traditional beauty, the
soul’s longing for vanished things and a
large acceptance of reality. He here
proved himself modern without being
extreme. He embraced the whole of
life, writing of “the confused glittering
armies of humankind,” yet reproducing “the
strange meditative moments of the soul” as
well. While shunning prettiness he scorns
the unrhythmic experiments of the
Imagists. His temper is more often sub-
dued than shrill. His verse is never peri-
lous: he never tampers with treasonable
thoughts. His poems written round the
War—“ The March,” “Behind the Lines,”
“On a Friend Recently Dead”—are threno-
dies that catch the wailing cadence of the
keen. Simplicity is an ingredient of his
genius, as in that most humane of all war
poems, “Lines to a Bull Dog.” But, though
his lute can compass the whole octave, it
is not always flawless. His later work,
“Rivers,” collapses into a catalogue, and
“The Moon”—“a sweet descent of beauty in
the_ night”—is unsustained in the severity
of its form. Sometimes his critical faculty
hampers creation, curbing the full solendor
of his fancy. At other times his" ideas
escape the bondage of metre.
To-day the jester is silent in admiration
of the singer; but Parody’s sybaritic form
is never out of sight. She calls and entices
her former captive, lighting his mind to
remembrance of her precious moments. And
though the fight for virtue is a noble spec-
tacle, half the poet’s admirers hope he will
again succumb to her charms.

Armageddon
A note from Florence Baverstock:—
Why do people worry over Armageddon? Plainly
they do; for one finds echoes of Walter Marks’s
speech in the House of Reps, reverberating in nearly
every newspaper. Is it the silly-season dearth of
news that makes so much copy of that ancient Book
of Revelation, which nearly everybody, by the way,
calls “Revelations”? The old, long-fulfilled, time-
expired prophecies are pronounced by a most impor-
tant, very learned and quite orthodox school of
Biblical critics to belong to the past. The Apoca-
lypse was concerned chiefly with the Siege of
Jerusalem by Titus and with the fall of Rome. The
number of the beast has been worked out to mean
Nero Caesar. Gorgeous Oriental imagery and splen-
did poetry rendered into the superb language of our
Authorised Version have carried the Apocalypse on
through the centuries till religious thought has be-
come saturated with it, and its mystic phrases have
become household words. Preterists believe that the
Book describes events of long ago. Futurists hold
that Armageddon is still to be fought. Many ordi-
nary folk thought that the Great War was Arma-
geddon—until pckt-Armistice world-happenings proved
that the Millennium is just as far off as ever.
V. B. Ibanez, in his “Four Horsemen of the Apo-
calypse,” brought up the Vision of the Seer of
Patmos as a topic. Multitudes of his readers appear
to have heard of those Sinister Riders for the first
time. An amusing touch about the novel in its
English dress was the description of the Four Horse-
men which the translator rendered into prose to
set one’s teeth on edge, apparently quite unconscious
that the English Bible would have been her best
crib for the whole passage: Cardinal Ximenes would
have saved her some trouble, too. But that is a
side-issue.
Prophecies regarding when and where Armageddon
is to come off have been made for centuries. Dates
have been fixed beforehand, and when dates have
glided past prophets have struck camp and set out
on further explorations. Intellectuals in every age
have been so much moved by the splendor of the
Seer’s vision that they have studied the Book until
it has become a kind of idolatry. My father (David
Blair) was a keen student of it from the futurist’s
standpoint. Some notes of his are now before me;
they were brought out because I was curious to see
how they tallied with the ideas of Walter Marks.
Written in 1897, they predicted a world-war, but—
a very big but —Russia was to play the rSle which
Germany filled. Otherwise the old welt politilc was
to march pretty much on all fours with what actually
happened before the recent slight unpleasantness.
The date of Armageddon was given as 1912. Not a
bad shot —in 1897.
The Double Cross
In The Renegades (Vidler, Melbourne)
Rupert Atkinson gives us a long narrative
poem, which, from the opening lines, shows
power and insight.
To her a wanton world of sweet delight
Life wearied him who each hour strove to right
The waywardness of aimless circumstance.
That is the preface to what is not so much
a human tale as an allegory covering a great
deal of the moral struggle of human life.
The man is an ascetic worker of high pur-
pose who strives to help and uplift the
stricken and sad. The woman is given
wholly to pleasure and the joy of life. The
man vows to convert the woman; the
woman to seduce the man. Both are suc-
cessful; but the play of one soul upon the
other is a theme which a novelist in 300
pages might handle less convincingly than
Rupert Atkinson has done it in a few
lines of fine rhetorical verse. To describe
verse as rhetorical is in no way to condemn
it. When that which should be lyric be-
comes rhetorical it is bad; but for the narra-
tive with a great life-problem behind it no
better medium can be chosen. The poem is
in rhymed couplets which stride along easily
without any sign of the march being forced.
Scarcely a line fails to scan truly; yet
monotony is avoided. The only frequent
rhythmic fault—one with a great deal too
much precedent in the longer work of our
greatest singers—is the tendency to carry
the sense just round the corner of a line and
let it fall rather heavily in a few abrupt
syllables. This in poorer work might jolt
the sleepy reader into wakefulness; but
where the interest is well maintained it has
only the effect of making the reading a little
more difficult. Naturally, from its theme,
this story has to deal prominently with sex;
but there is a little too much insistence upon
matters which are well enough suggested
without direct statement. An ascetic, con-
verted from his cell and set madly running
with the wood-nymphs of Arcady to the
music of Pan’s pipes, would hardly be likely
to insist painfully on his 40 years of chas-
tity while wooing his chosen nymph.
In The Renegades Rupert Atkinson shows
the power to do things, and he may be more
successful in a tale wherein the wind blows
freely and there is less of the suffocating
atmosphere of dark streets and close-cur-
tained rooms. The book is illustrated by
Christian Yandell with drawings that follow
Beardsley’s model with a hint of Hugh
McCrae.
D. M. W.
A Satchel of Books
A Gallery of Games, by Fougasse (Cape, Lon-
don). A chucklesome collection of skits on outdoor
and indoor sports that have already raised laughs
from the readers of Punch, The Sketch and other
English weeklies.
The Roof Tree, by Charles Neville Buck (Hodder
and Stoughton). The latest of a thousand three-
deckers about the mountaineers of Kaintuck. Buck’s
efforts to make the old junk interesting are worthy
of a fresher theme.
The White Butterfly, by Ethel Jackson Morris (De
Garis). Fairy'stories brightly told and beautifully
illustrated. A book that the small Australian female
will gloat over, and even sophisticated adults will
dwell lovingly on Miss Morris’s delightful drawings
which are so superbly reproduced.
Little Obelia, and the Further Adventures of Ragged
Blossom, Snugglepot and Cuddlepie, by May Gibbs
(Angus and Robertson). A joyous addition to the
Snugglepot books, with which Miss Gibbs has won
the hearts of the youngsters. There’s, no better gift
for Australia, jun., than these delightfully-illustrated
fantasies.
The Crystal Bowl, by J. J. Hall (Whiteombe and
Tombs). Another gift-book for youngsters that proves
Australia can produce what it wants in this par-
ticular line. It contains a series of well-told fairy
stories of Australian birds and flowers, and is whimsi-
cally illustrated in black-and-white and color by
Dorothy Wall. Admirably turned out.
Australian Grasses and Pasture Plants, by Fred
Turner (Whiteombe and Tombs). One of the “Aus-
tralian Practical Handbooks,” and though the
author is handicapped in the matter of space his
notes deal with a comprehensive list of grasses,
shrubs and trees, and he includes some useful hints
on laying down permanent pasture. The book is
illustrated with many careful drawings by Mary I.
Turner.
Paris Nights, by Arnold Bennett (Hodder and
Stoughton). The Paris Nights are only i>ortion 0 f
a series of sketches of life and habits in Riviera,
Swiss, Italian and English resorts which Bennett
has visited from time to time. With his literary
equipment he is able to write breezily and informa-
tively on many things. He is most readable in his
references to the French capital: he has turned Paris
.into a series of striking nocturnes without dwelling
on the wickedness which has provided other writers
with a furtive gloat.
Dancing for Strength and Beauty, by Edward
Scott (Allen and Unwin). This isn’t a dancing
manual, though much practical information is given.
The author tears down many popular misconcep-
tions, particularly as to old-time dances. Stage
producers, for instance, who think they’ve ever put
on minuets would find their ears a-tingle if they
happened to read him. Incidentally, he quotes an
old Chinese proverb to the effect that one may
judge a monarch by the state of dancing in his
reign. If that holds good, what sort of an unex-
pectedly racketty person must George Rex be?
Wildflowers of Western Australia, by Emily 11.
Pelloe (De Garis Publishing House). Until this
appeared the best illustrated account of the wonder-
ful Westralian wildflowers was produced by a Ger-
man. Mrs. Pelloe has removed this reproach by
writing a charming book, one that will appeal
equally to the naturalist and the amateur. Along
with the scientist’s passion for collecting material
she has the gift of writing interestingly, and is no
mean hand with the pencil and brush. Moreover,
the printer, engraver and binder have treated the
lady well. The result is a publication that is not
only useful but handsome. There are colored plates
of about 70 beautiful varieties, including the lovely
purple hovea and leschenaultia, the quaint kangaroo
paws, the delicate hibiscus, templetonia, fringed lily,
Geraldton wax-flower (familiar in the Sydney Botanic
Gardens), the gorgeous Christmas bush and the mag-
nificent flowering gum.
The Top Landing, by P. J. Brebner (Hodder and
Stoughton). A demobilised English officer leads
himself into temptation and is imprisoned for
theft. Helped with a timely loan by a rich trench-
mate he establishes himself in an old French town
and writes novels. On the other side of the landing
lives a beautiful young artist who wears silk
undergarments—a point solemnly stressed by the
author —and talks the sentiments .of Elinor Glyn
in the style of Lindley Murray. To her he avows
his love and humiliation; to him she confesses that
she has had improper relations with his patron,
who arrives at this interesting juncture. Not a
bad story, and it would be a lot better ,if the dia-
logue didn’t get so infernally stilted at passionate
moments.
The Fruits of Victory, by Norman Angell (Col-
lins). This book is - written partly to explain
that the writer, in “The Great Illusion,”' didn’t say
that war was impossible. What he said was that
it would .always be futile. He sets out now to re-
establish its futility with the evidence the world has
furnished in the past seven years—and especially
in the past three. How to prevent wars without sac-
rifice of justice is the world’s greatest problem; and
since wars can only be stopped by the peoples say-
ing they won’t have them, the world’s hope seems
to lie in propaganda. Angell gives good reasons
why the world should engage in this publicity work
—this dissemination of plain truth. “The very
justification which we advance for our war-time
censorships and propaganda, our suspension of free
speech and discussion, is,” he says, “that if we
gave full value to the enemy’s case, saw the
defects of our own and cfur Allies’ policy, saw
what our own acts in war really involved and how
nearly they resembled those : which aroused our anger
when done by the enemy—if we saw all this and
kept our heads we should abandon war.” There is,
moreover, what may be called the spiritual as well
as the physical damage. TTie past three years have
shown as perhaps the world was never shown before
that “war leaves us a less workable society”—it is
“marked by an increase in the forces of chaos and
disintegration.” Angell has some pregnant chapters
on that most important phase of the question.
Whether the world is always going to have the curse
of war between nations this page doesn’t know. But
it thinks it knows that the only hope of getting rid
of it —even of greatly reducing the danger of it —is
to make the people of the world see what an insane
thing it is ; and this new book of Angell’s will cer-
tainly help to do that.
The Inky Way
Sydney Daily Telegraph gets a fresh news-editor
in Knox, who has recently been using a blue pencil
on Smith's Weekly. Todd goes back to his old
job of compiling the World’s News.
“T.R.H.” : Lloyd George, like that other strenuous
Welshman W. M. Hughes, has in his time played many
p'arts—-mostly with success. But one of his failures was
as a journalist. When the proprietors of the
London Star began to publish the Morning Leader
one of the most frequent suppliers of rejected MSS.
was Lloyd George, whose articles, like his speeches,
were too florid. The journalist who turned down his
copy in those days was his present Attorney-General,
Sir Gordon Hewart, who, after leader-writing on the
Star and “London-corresponding” for the Manches-
ter Guardian, was responsible for the political part
of the Morning Leader. According to Hewart
“Lloyd George could never realise that the simplest
English was the best.”


Good Old Xmas,

PATENT STEEL SPLIT
THE BARRY STEEL SPLIT PULLEY
represents the most considerable for-
ward step yet taken in the design and
manufacture of a steel split pulley.
The BARRY is Electrically Spot Welded by
the latest and most improved methods. Weld-
ing is the strongest possible means of joining
metals, presenting many advantages over the
old-stvle riveting. There are no rivets in a
BARRY Pulley to work loose or shear under
strain. The BARRY is made of special steel
and formed in accurately constructed dies.

“ G.”
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Chinwag” : I live at Adelaide, and seven
years ago a friend at the Semaphore (eight
miles away) wrote me greetings for my
birthday. I received this communication
about a fortnight ago, but as it was posted
before the twopenny postage came in it only
had a penny stamp on it, and I had to pay
double deficiency.
“S.N.T.”: Anew if microscopic contribu-
tion to the payment of interest on Austra-
lia’s debt ha.s been provided by a Melb. man,
who sent a shipment of asparagus for sale in
London. The goods arrived in fine condi-
tion and were gratefully received. On that
success it is proposed to keep the supply
going all through the British winter months,
when fresh asparagus has hitherto been off
the British menu.
“D.F.” : Australia’s first steam-engine was
very nearly a rival of the one-horse shay
that ran a 100 years to a day. John Dick-
son started the machine in May, 1815, in a
building at the corner of Dixon (Lord knows
why it is spelt that way) and Harbor streets,
Sydney, on a grant of 15 acres of land from
Governor Macquarie. Afterwards he moved
to the end of Goulburn-street, and in 1903
his original engine, or part of it, was still
running in the grist mill there.
“Dido”: How significant is the failure of
Blank as a perambulator-maker coupled with
his subsequent success as proprietor of a
cooked-meat emporium! He ran his shop
for making and mending “baby-carriages”
right among the flats of St. Kilda, and his
creditors accepted Is. 9d. in the f. He got.
into business again as quickly as possible.
But this time he ran a small-goods and
cooked-food store, still among the flats, and
from the first day he thrived. I rebuked
him lately for his preposterous prices.
“Well,” he retorted, “they wouldn’t have
my cheap prams, and now I’ve got some-
thing they do want I’m going to make them
pay. If they won’t keep children,” he added
in justification, “they can jolly well keep
me.”
“Pongo”: It seems strange that no one
has placed certain Australian-made carpen-
ters’ tools upon the market. Especially
wooden planes. A pre-war catalogue shows
the following prices: Jack-planes (2:jin.
iron), ss. 9d. (present price, 255. 6d.) ; try-
planes (24in. iron), 7s. 3d. (present, 335.
6d.) ; smoothing-planes (2jin. iron), 4s. 9d.
(present, 20s. 3d.). There is a golden oppor-
tunity here for a go-ahead Aussie. Perhaps
we haven’t a timber equal to the beech of
which the quoted tools are made, but we
have excellent substitutes —Tasmanian black-
wood, brush box, Queensland black bean,
eoachwood, etc. There is not a grea t amount
of work involved; the greatest difficulty is
in obtaining seasoned timber. The present
charges are nothing short of robbery.*
“Wart”: Only the skeleton is left of the
Supply flour mill (Tas.), where Philosopher
Smith, the discoverer of Bischoff, served his
apprenticeship 90 years ago. The mill was
built by Symes and Guillan. In 1840 they
sent the Dusty Miller with a cargo of flour
to S. Aus. uninsured ; she was wrecked and
they were ruined. Guillan got a fresh start,
but Symes is said to have ended up as a one-
legged fruit-seller in the streets of Mel-
bourne. The mill ceased to grind 50 years
ago. There was never much wheat country
round it, but the water power of Supply
River and the shipping facilities in the days
of small boats made up for it. For many
years after the mill was abandoned the
Plummer family, whose grandfather started
shipbuilding on the Tamar a century ago,
used to hold a New Year’s dance in the
building.
“L.E.”: A Victorian verse-maker, who
recently carried a swag through parts of N.
S. Wales and came back across the border,
remarks that the swagman is looked upon
quite differently in the two States. In New
South he is taken for granted, and treated
like any other human being. Carrying a
swag is regarded as a natural way of travel-
ling for work. He was given directions
by policemen. He could stop and have a
yarn with cocky farmers. But the poet has
a different tale to tell of his own State. As
soon as he crossed the border he was looked
upon as a suspicious character. Policemen
didn’t treat him kindly; they followed him
with distrustful looks. He had no social
status. He was an outcast, a tramp, a vag-
rant. Cocky farmers whistled for the dog.
“They were so full of wheat,” observes the
poet, “I thought they were going to burst.”
COTTS. FOR PROTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Half uniuni. cott. use all cons. Plots, preferred.
... .Leichhardt.”
Dear home of light, sweet half-unfurnished cott.,
Where the dead German Leichhardt hath his name!
Here one may use all cons, if he’s a Pr.ot.
Though rent will soothe the Roman tenants’ shame,
While landlords suffer and forbid them not
To live with cons, in the unfurnished cott.
The half-unfurnished cott. sectarian!
What joy the happy tenantry must feel—
Socinian, Calvinist and Aryan—•
Reading of Romans broken on the wheel;
Nor shall sweet Auburn, loveliest of the plain,
Nor even Rookwood know such joys again.
The Christian life in that cott. half unfurn.
How beautiful it is to see and know,
Reading the Watchman tell how Romans burn
.On earth as prelude to the fire below ;
How sweet life in that half-unfurnished cott.
Whose Christian owner much prefers a Plot.!
There children sing themselves to happy sleep
AVith maledictions on the sects apart,
And Christian mothers watch the peaceful, deep
Slumber of these who near are to God’s heart,
And pray their darkness may be changed to light
That they may know a Cartherlic-k on sight.
Triumph of life and of the centuries !
Christ’s poverty made pomp and revenue!
The heathen worse than immoralities
And sectaries sleeping but when rents are due!
All, happy be we Pagans, whose high lot
Is not in cotts. unfurnished for a Prot.

“Tau”: The Smith family takes a back
seat in Noo Yark these days. The most
strongly represented name among the TJ.S.A.
soldiers and sailors from the western Jerusa-
lem was Cohen, which beat Smith easily, and
the Jones clan by two to one.
“Ron H.”: An old lady I know gets her
words weirdly tangled sometimes. In con-
versation with her the other day I remarked
that it seemed no time since last Christmas.
“Oh, well, you know,” she responded, “time,
tide and maternity wait for no man!”
“D.F.”: The old-time Hobart Town
whalers were a tough lot. One captain who
had been driving his crew unmercifully was
told by his own brother to lay off a bit,
whereupon the skipper shoved him into an
empty oil-cask and kept him there for the 17
days’ run to Hobart. He was fed through
the bunghole.
“Hindi”: Recently passed out, Johnny
Franklin, known all over nor’-east Yic. and
the Riverina as a grade-A drover of the old
school. In the days of his youth Johnny’s
skin was almost as dark as the ace of spades,
but late in life it cleared, and years before
he died his complexion was pink and white.
He had just touched 80 when the call came.
Now that he has been to Rome to see the
Pope, Dr. Phelan, Bishop of Sale, who has
come back via America, feels more like
the real shepherd. With Tommy Cullinan,
his friend, as Mayor of Sale, there shouldn’t
be anything to complain of in the way of a
reception in his home town, where, as a fact,
he is generally regarded as a big citizen and
good neighbor.
The Speck’s West Coast fields are so sick
that the Zeehan School of Mines is closing
down its day-classes, and for the future min-
ing will be only a part-time subject taught
at evening sessions. The school was estab-
lished in ’94 with an honorary staff; but
two years later, with the assistance of a
Government grant, two salaried instructors
were employed. It has been in its present
home since 1903.
Thinking Melbourne Town Hall folk were
a bit previous in hoisting a flag on Novem-
ber 30, when Queen Alexandra’s 77th birth-
day did not occur till December 1, people
made inquiries about it. Then it was dis-
closed that the bunting was flown in honor
of St. Andrew. It was Cabena, it appears,
who hit on the scheme of giving George,
Patrick, Andrew and David each a show on
his day, but most people had forgotten all
about if.
“Coolyah”: Be careful at the parcels post-
office. I was informed by a young man
working at one that “to compensate for mis-
takes in giving out too much change” an
overcharge is made on parcels. The excess
stamps are removed from the parcel when
the customer leaves and are then sold again.
My informant declares that as much as a
pound a day can be made by overcharging
Chows at one office he mentions.
In the fourth edition of their “Annotations
of the Crown Bands Acts (N.S.W.)” E. Yv.
Brierly and T. W. Irish, both officers of the
Dept, of Lands, have brought the volume
well up to date. The notes are set out in a
way allowing-of easy reference and assuring
that the reader cannot overlook any amend-
ing legislation. The book, which is pub-
lished by the Law Book Co., will answer
many questions for the man who has any-
thing whatever to do with land.
Sixty years ago the barristers on the roll
in N. S. Wales numbered 53, of whom less
than 20 were recognised practitioners. James
Martin and Peter Faucett were Attorney-
and Solicitor-General respectively. Five had
the right to tack Q.C. to their names (Plun-
kett, Manning, Darvall, Broadhurst and
Hargrave), and nine held D.C. Judgeships
and other legal offices. At least five were too
wealthy to look for briefs; others, though
on the N. S. Wales roll, were located in
Queensland, notably Innes, Paul and Blake.
Five were Crown Prosecutors, headed by
Edward Butler. The Judges were Alfred
Stephen, S. F. Milford and Edward Wise.
“Te Whare” on a trinity of pioneers:—
In the forties of last century almost all the land in
the Bega (N.S.W.) district was held by three brothers
Imlay—Capt. Alexander, Dr. George and Peter—
mostly under lease. Alexander and George lived at
Tarraganda, and Peter at what is now known as
Eastwood. An old Imlay property, Corridgeree,
adjoining Tarraganda, recently changed hands at
up to £46 an acre. Alexander and George lie
buried on Tarraganda, with a huge granite boulder
bearing a copper-plate over them. Peter migrated
to M.L., and gave the town of Imlay its name.
Mount Imlay, near Eden, keeps the brothers’
memory alive on the far south coast of N. S. Wales.
George, once in Government employ as surgeon,
ended his own life on Boxing Day, 1857, on the
mountain between Bega and the coast now known
as Dr. George Mountain. None of the Imlays, I
believe, left descendants.
“Aloysius” considers the navvy:—
When “Rio” (B. 17/11/’21) comments on the
disappearance of the “hefty, mostly Irish” navy,
isn’t he merely drawing attention to the difference
between the comic (English) and the actual (Aus-
tralian) types? In navvying or unskilled laboring
the main thing is that a man should be broke and
unable to get work in his own line. During my
periods of social seclusion I have been in a good
number of gangs, and never once did the number of
Patlanders strike me as being disproportionate. By
the way—and this applies chiefly to pre-war days—
native-born Australians were always in a minority;
British immigrants formed an overwhelming majo-
rity in all the gangs. Further, there has never been
an imposing average of physique among navvies,
local ones at least. A gang of construction workers
averaging 12st. would be rather a curiosity. Navvy-
ing, as it is practised here, calls not so much for
strength and stamina as for endurance and docility.
The average power of a gang is that of its weakest
and tiredest member. It doesn’t call for trained ath-
letes of outstanding physique to swing a “banjo”
or let fall a pick to the pace set by a 9st. or lOst.
work-mate. Hercules in an Australian navvy gang
would find small scope for his power, that is if he
ever got a start, for most gangers look with sus-
picion on your big, hefty would-be navvy. They
prefer a medium-sized man as likely to be a better
worker and a poorer loafer than the 13st. or 14st.
six-footer. Speaking as one well in the heavy-
weight class, I must admit that the average ganger’s
suspicions are well justified.

other end.

The British jockey Donoghue, with 141
winning mounts, during the just-ended English fiat-
racing season easily beat the Australian F. Bullock,
whose score was 124. Carslake (88) was third. Ihe
figures are surprising, as the three were at one time
neck-and-neck. Interest in the struggle for supre-
macy was arousing a good deal of feeling in Eng-
land, which may have led to Donoghue being fed
with the best of the mounts towards the end.

The Bananaland Derby-winner Lawn
Mower could not live with the lightweight Keml-
brook in the Governor’s Cup (ljm.) on the first day
of Bananaland Turf Club’s Summer Meeting. Ihe
time was only a second worse than Fairy Bob s Aus-
tralasian record put up last year at Ascot (Q-).
The champion son of Fairy Gold appears in need of
a spell. It is a long time since he started at 10 s,
which was his price in the Governor’s Cup.

“Smike”: Matt Ellis, one of the Vic.
cricket selectors and a great racecourse student, pro-
bably inherited his fondness for the gee-gees from
his father, “Sandy” Ellis, who was one of Mel-
bourne’s first jocks, winning the “Town Plate of five
sovs., with 50 sovs. added,” near the site of the
present Flemington course in 1846. The i own
Plate was run in three heats, and the lack of judg-
ment shown by one Muff in losing the first run on
Petrel decided the owner of the nag to hand o\er
the mount to Ellis, who justified the change by leav-
ing a street between his animal and the next candi-
date in both events.

“Rechercbeur”: How’s this for a cricket
record? W. M. Woodfull, captain of Maryborough
(Vie.) Public Service team, has so far, in last sea-
son and this, totalled 1263 runs for 15 innings. He
has had 10 not-outs and therefore averages 252.6
for 14 seasons! His best scores are 174, 149, 116,
107, 107, 96, 89 and 83 (all not out), 87 and 63.
His record this season reads 4 inns. ; 3 not-outs;
highest score, 174 n.o. ; total runs, 482 ; average,
482. Maryborough loses its star this month when
Woodfull takes his transfer from Maryborough High
School staff to Williamstown. With his brother
8.5. A., another cricketing son of Rev. T. S. B.
Woodfull-, he will represent South Melbourne. W.M.
includes among other performances a half-century
against Douglas’s Englishmen at Ballarat last seasu...
Last year bookmakers were banned alto-
gether in M.L. But though many cases were brought
by the police, few convictions were obtained, as
the accused have the right of trial by jury, and
unless a jury has been taken down by a bookie it
apparently declines to convict him, no matter how
strong the Crown’s evidence may be. Now the
Dominion Sportsmen’s Association (which is the
Bookmakers’ Protective Society with a £lOOO-per-
annum organiser) has put it to Parliament that it
would be better to license the bookmaker for a
stiff fee than to spend thousands of pounds trying in
vain to put him out of action. The Association
proposes that Ike should pay to the Government
£2OO a year for the right to do business in the
inside enclosure and £5O for the outer; and to
the club £2O a day for the inside and £5 for the
outer. The new revenue will appeal to the Primin-
ister if he can find it in him to swallow his previ-
ously-expressed remarks.

The Yanks announce the arrival of an-
other prospective world’s champion swimmer —John
Weismuller, a 17-year-old Illinois lad. Weismuller,
who headed both Ludy Langer and Norman Ross re-
cently in the furlong American National Champion-
ship, had previously been credited with swimming
the lOOvds. in 52 l-ssec. This story was swallowed
with a ‘ pinch of salt, until he walloped “Stubby”
Kruger, the Honolulu star, over the distance in
53 l-ssec., establishing a new “Pie Dish” world’s
record. The recognised world’s best for 100yds.
straight belongs to Kahanamoku at 53sec. The
slickest recognised 100yds. ever recorded by
an Australian is Albert Barry’s 55 4-ssec. in the
100yds. championship of N.S.W. in 1915, when he
filled third place to the Hawaiians, Kahanamoku
and Cunha. The best swims (recognised) of our
other cracks are: Longworth, 56 l-ssec.; Beaurepaire,
58sec.; R. Cavill, 58sec.; Cecil Healy, 57sec.; H.
Hardwick, 57sec. ; F. C. V. Lane, 59 3-ssec. From
these figures some idea of the quality of the latest
Yankee speed-merchant may be formed. Weismuller
uses the American trudgeon-crawl stroke. His
100yds. in 53 l-ssec. was notched in a 25yds. tank.

“G.C.D.” : J. 11. Kirkwood gave a fine exhibi-
tion in a four-hall match at the Victoria Club’s links
at Fisherman’s Bend (Vic.) the other day. Part-
nered with Victor East, he finished square against
A. Ee Fevre, the present open champion, and the
local professional A. Maiden. In spite of a strong
wind and nasty rain squalls, Kirkwood was round in
72 and clipped nine strokes off bogey. His driving,
which is 20 yards longer than it was before he
went away, was nearly always straight, his seconds
were mostly faultless, and but for indifferent putting
he would have broken 70. He was only once in
difficulties, and then showed his almost unequalled
nerve and resource. At the 13th Le Fevre was sure
of a 4, while Kirkwood was through the green and
on a nasty hanging bank with his second. Taking
his niblick he tore away enough rubbish to fill a
bucket and nearly holed in 3. A half in 4 resulted
and the hole and the match were saved. Kirkwood
js full of those little tricks. And they come just
when they are required, which is the difference be-
tween a good golfer and a great one.

THE GIFT OF GIFTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Prince elected to run to the railway station
instead of being driven. He covered the distance—
about a mile-—at a smart pace, and pulled up look-
ing fit.”
I do not envy you your rank or costly pleasures,
Prince.
Behind your shining life one sees the gyves;
A thousand dreary functions you must face and
never wince;
The irritating patriot who strives
To use you as he does the Flag must be received
with smiles;
The wowser and the bore be hypnotised by courtlj
wiles.
But when I read of how you danced all night till
break of day,
Then rode a race or joined a yachting crew,
Had breakfast, did a round of golf and halted on
your way
To swim, to play a tennis set or two—
Ah, then, I own to sentiments of unalloyed regret,
The futile jealousy of one in Age’s bitter net!
Continue, Prince, and don’t mind me Yet each
fresh proof you give
That you are what 1 used to be of old,
When nights and days were all too short, and life
was made to live,
Falls on my heart like ice, and leaves it cold.
For me the day is dead for aye, howe’er I grieve
for it,
When I could do a fast-run mile and “pull up
looking fit.”

A dust-proof farm engine
doss it mean anything' to you ?
H
DID you ever notice how much dust you
picked up during chaffcutting, especi-
ally if you were perspiring? Did you
ever stop to think that the oily surfaces of the
piston, cylinder walls, connecting rod and
crank shaft of an ordinary open crank-case
engine were picking up just as much dust, if
not more? And all that grit is being ground
between the piston and cylinder and working
into the various bearings! Is it any wonder
that such an engine has a short life and is
continually needing some adjustment?
With the Lister Engine you have no such worry. Every
working part of the Lister”—including governor gear and
cam-shaft—is entirely enclosed. No dust or dirt can get in to
work havoc with the moving parts. And you will need less
time to clean the engine. Nothing is lost in convenience by
the enclosed crank-case, for a large inspection door allows
free access when required.
Other “Lister” features are equally valuable.
Let us tell you about them in detail.

Low-pressure Steam for Economy
For Heating and Boiling Requirements
—as distinct from power purposes—practically all needs may be fully met
with steam pressures from two to ten pounds per square inch. For this class
of work a high-prCssure boiler is quite unnecessary, and costs far more than
an IDEAL Low-pressure Steam Boiler of an equal heating capacity. IDEAL
Boilers are built up in sections, and may be added to when required to meet
an increased demand. They require no expensive foundation or setting, and
their slow rate of combustion, in addition to saving attendance, brings about
a remarkable economy in fuel, which is the primary reason for their rapidly
growing popularity.

IDEAL Sectional Steam Boiler.
To proprietors of Hotels and Restaurants, and to Institutional and Factory
Engineers the IDEAL Low-pressure Steam Boiler represents the cheapest
means of raising steam for a varied range of utilities. There are Baths,
Lavatories and Sinks to be supplied with large volumes of hot water; Jacketted
Pans, Vegetable Steamers, Tea Lhns, Hot Presses and other Kitchen
Equipment requiring steam at from 51b. to 101 b. pressure; and also Drying
Cabinets and Washing Troughs for Laundry use.
IDEAL Steam Boilers are made in a wide range of capacities—small and
handy types to suit the most limited demand—others larger, to evaporate
1200 pounds or more of water per hour.
Write us for printed matter and prices, giving particulars of your require-
ments. We shall be pleased to give expert advice on the applicability of
the IDEAL Boiler to any given set of conditions.

Developing the
Blue Metal Industry
WHAT THE N.S.W. BLUE METAL CO.,
LIMITED, HAS DONE.
The N.S.W. Blue Metal Co., Limited, was
developed by men who were pioneers of the
blue-metal industry in N.S.W.
It has been one of the most important
factors in building up the industry, and is
now the biggest individual supplier of blue
metal in the State.
The company owns three of the principal
quarries of the State—Prospect Quarry,
Minnamurra Quarry and Bombo Quarry—
on which the deposits of metal are of tin
linest quality, and for all practical purposes
in quantity inexhaustible.
Despite the increase of plant in these quar-
ries from time to time, the output has been
unable to cope with the demand. For the
past year the scarcity of blue metal in
N.S.W. has seriously retarded road construc-
tion, and has also hindered the building
trade, which depends largely upon the screen-
ings of the metal for the manufacture of con-
crete.
The working of the Minnamurra and
Prospect Quarries, and the Bombo Quarry
in its present temporarily equipped condi-
tion, results in a net profit at the rate of
£16.000 per annum, and, when the equipment
of Bombo is complete, the additional output
will increase the profits to well over £25,000
per annum.
WHAT THE N.S.W. ASSOCIATED BLUE
METAL QUARRIES, LIMITED, WILL
DO.
The N.S.W. Associated Blue Metal Quar-
ries, Limited, is going to guarantee that
there will be no future shortage of blue metal.
It has, therefore, taken over from the
N.S.W. Blue Metal Co., Limited, the whole
of its assets and business as a going concern.
Additional plant is being installed that will
permit of a yearly ouput of over 300,000 tons.
Contracts have already been arranged with
municipal councils and other bodies for the
disposal of the bulk of the output for at least
three years, and the balance will leave no
requirements unsatisfied.
For this sound undertaking new capital is
required, and of the total capital of £150,000
(in £1 shares), 50,000 10 per cent. First
Preference shares are being offered to the
public on the terms set out in the published
prospectus.
The directors of the new company are:
J. W. Meader, Esq. (late chairman of direc-
tors of W. Meader and Co., Limited, and
Managing Director of N.S.W. Blue Metal
Co., Limited) ; J. C. Alexander, Esq. (Chair-
man of Directors Emu and Prospect Gravel
and Road Metal Co., Ltd.) ; James Vicars,
Esq. (Director N.S.W. Blue Metal Co.,
Limited) : lion. C. A. Coghlan, M.L.C.
(former Chairman of Directors South Coast
Road Metal Quarries, Limited) ; Albert E.
Dalwood, Esq. (Real Estate Manager).
OWING TO THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FOR SHARES THAT HAS
BEEN RECEIVED, THE SUBSCRIPTION LIST WILL CLOSE IN THE COURSE
OF A FEW DAYS.

Xmas Diamonds Reduced
Yes, our Diamonds this Christmas are a full
one-third less in price than last Christmas.
HOW ?
During the pronounced trade slump and the
period of high-priced money, many holders of
Diamonds were compelled to realise large par-
cels of gems, and knowing we always hold
large cash balances, they offered them to us at
great reductions on cost.
WE BOUGHT THEM.
This enables us to sell at one-third less prices.
Will Diamonds fall further? We think with
money being now cheaper and trade reviving
that there will be no more farced sales at
ruinous reductions.

Sydney-woman Marguerite Dale’s play
“Secondary Considerations” was staged for
the first time by the Repertory Society on
Saturday night at the Playhouse. The play
has one act, the third, full of power and
thrill; the first two and the unnecessary
fourth are rather talky, but every now and
then flash such a light into human nature
that Mrs. Dale’s next work will be looked
for with interest. The third act is so dra-
matic yet so restrained that the first-night
house remained motionless for" several
seconds after the curtain had fallen on the
second of the two middle-aged sisters who,
against her better judgment, has signed away
her little fortune to help a dissolute brother
for whom she and her sister have been ex-
ploited all their lives. Eleanor Ross and
Beatrice McDonald, as the two elderly spin-
sters, are the “Secondary Considerations,”
and make the parts as depressing and as
Gissing-isli as are all good stories of “super-
fluous women.” These two undoubtedly
show much talent for Repertory work.
Albert Collins as the overbearing, purse-
proud brother was convincingly detestable;
and others in the cast were Erna Living,

“Going Up” having proved to the liking
of a city that had small use for “Theodore
and Co.” and is fed up with U.S. farce, the
season has been extended for a week. On
Saturday, December 24, “You’re in Love”
will take up its quarters at the Sydney
Royal.
The crinolines and swallertails of “May-
time,” which have been given an airing at
Her Majesty’s, Sydney, for a fortnight, go
back to the mothballs to-morrow night. On
Saturday “The Boy” will make his obeis-
ance to the large utterance of the early gods.
In the lengthening list of high-priced
shows for which playgoers have heartlessly
refused to share the oress-agent’s enthusi-
asm, “The Laughter of Fools” is not in-
cluded. Tliusfar it has lasted a month at
the Sydney Palace, which is a long run as
things go; but nevertheless its nights are
numbered. “Smilin’ Through” is due on
December 24, with Frank Harvey and Wil-
liam ,T. Kelly helping Maude Hanaford to
make a success of it.

is to be the nefarious auxiliary, and Jennie
Hartley will gather tbo principal boy’s tights

The self-starting floor-cloth in “The Fro-
lics of 1921” at Sydney Tivoli has only to
make four more trips before it is put out of
commission. Last-week changes put Ethel
Walker into Cissie Vaughan’s shoes as June,
and set Lena Ryan and Ray Maclean
a-sparkle in new dances. Ada Cerito has
left the rank, and the newcomers in patter
and song will enjoy but a short supremacy
m this line, for Wilkie Bard is to hang up
his stocking in this city on Christmas Eve.
The presswomen’s matinee at Sydney
Palace was one of the bright spots in a dull
week. There were a few changes on the
programme owing to the usual last-moment
disappointments, but the missing lines were
adequately supplied by Nancy Ileinwood and
Mrs. Frank Lynch. Two quaint and clever
dancing children, Zenda and Jack, did an
acrobatic foxtrot, the small lady, to the
huge delight of the audience, pulling her
skirt mast-high in her determination to make
her somersault a whiz-bang. Mrs. Alex-
ander Gordon sang one of her delightful
h rench songs, to which Miss Austin sup-
plied the accompaniment. Jean Drummond’s
ana from “Mefistofele” had to be supple-
mented by “Vissi D’Arte.” Haagen Holen-
bergh’s Chopin Polonaise was wildly encored
and he returned thanks with the sparkling
Lizst Campanella.

“Merrie England” moves to Melbourne
S al fr ° m Her Majesty’s on Saturday
night. Ilobably the, melodious opera wiil
sound all the better for the change, and
even look all the better, whilst the eompara-
tive weakness of the second act retains its
unfortunate puerility unimpaired. One has
to swear by composer German’s flowing
music even when swearing at the narrative’s
trivial tail-end, which flaunts its fiction in
the face of solemn fact and presents moder-
ately Good Queen Bess as a person who goes
around secretly purchasing packets of poison
from the first mountebank she doesn’t know
by sight. Plot, however, is said not to
matter in an opera which partakes of the
quality of “grand,” and is at least “roman-
tic. Weighed in the balance with “Trova-
tore” or “The Bohemian Girl” this is a
sweetly reasonable story. But “Merrie
England,” of course, lacks the extenuating
circumstance of being an antique, as in the
Balfe case, or incomprehensible, as in the
other.
Melbourne Majesty’s will be privately
engaged with its coming panto for the week
before Christmas. “Babes in the Wood”
comes due on the 24th, and whereas every
panto is preceded by a flourish of truni-
pets the fanfarade on this occasion has the
peculiarity of being impressive. The
Bulletin almost believes in this panto in
advance.

Melba is now in the midst of Concerts for
the People at Melbourne Town Hall the
people receiving excellent value for their ss.
Pius tax. The wonderful Dame sings always
the same five principal numbers, and the
I eople, were they polled on the question,
would probably express a preference for
fearan Rose” and “The Waters of Minnie-
something.” . Rut she has notes to soothe the
savage ear in “Voi Che Sapete,” also the
songs from “Faust,” and her “Down in the
forest Was ever one of her most haunting
efforts. Una Bourne, Lemmone and Zelman’s
Symphony Orchestra are concerned in this
Melba triumph. The concerts happen three
times a week until the 23rd. Then an inter-
val will extend until January 5, when a
further series of eight concerts begins. All
tickets for all of them have been already
snapped up.
Zelman and his wife are to have a concert
of their own at Melbourne Town Hall on
lhursday, the 22nd. They will be tripping
to Europe next year, seemingly, and the con-
cert (with Melba among the distinguished
patromsers) is by way of giving them a
send-off.

At Melbourne King’s our old friend Mr.
i lm will dodder no more into the domicile of
Marie jLempest and Graham Browne after
Friday of this week. Neither will “The
Dumb and the Blind” preach its wholesome
little sermon to the bloke whose bark is wuss
than ’is bite. . “Penelope” is to be staged
on Saturday, with a cast that will make it
seem rather different from what it was at
the Royal some four or five years ago.
The days and nights of Ella Shields at
Melbourne Tivoli are to terminate next Fri-
day. Meanwhile her gentlemanly stride
and mild contralto warble continue to be
associated with an artistry which is all her
own, and when she gets to her impersona-
tion of. Bertie, the futile follower of fashion,
who sometimes dosses on Rothschild’s door-
step, the house is ready to eat out of her
hand. Cahill is still subordinating his pian-
istic talent to the playing of accompaniments
for tenor Brooke; a small damsel named
Rene is a charming song-and-dance turn;
restless fiddler Maurice Sterndale persists in
scoring with the cheapest of effects, and the
rest of the programme is on a rising scale.
1 erhaps the cartoonist and the strong man
who wears a twining young lady next to his
waist are the best of the rest.

San Francisco’s Chinatown gets a lurid
advt. in ‘After Midnight” at Hoyt’s, Mel-

leading figure and improves his biceps by
flooring fat yellow crooks and recovering a
goddess from an underworld den.
The Tamer,” which follows, introduces
Criadys V) alton as a shapely circus nvmph
who. besides subduing lions, develops 'in a
wild millionaire a passion for milk food and
early bed. “Bars of Iron,” the third of
Iloyfs features, is the first of the new Stoll
British films crammed full of physical combat
like the Ethel Dell novel which provided the
plot. Earle Williams is the star at the
Majestic in “The Silver Car,” a yarn which
enmeshes a strong cast in Balkan intrigue
and rattles the sabre in several places. Sup-
porting this is a picturesoue version of “The
Three Musketeers.” Tenor Balboni also
warbles at intervals in a repertoire of popular
operatic airs. The Britannia is the present
refuge of “The Foolish Matrons,” who find
marriage rather wearing without complacent
husbands aijd large bank accounts. Melba
P’ i r»nortevs are absorbed in an Australian
drama, “Know Thy Child,” which presumes
to peer into the lives of our most expensive

From an Adelaide critic
At the P. W. Preeco gallery is a well-chosen show
of’ etchings and black-and-white work, with much of
Shirlow’s recent exhibit remaining- in. Lionel Lind-
say ranges from Spain to the Adelaide hills, which,
as a pleasant compliment to a fellow-artist, he calls
“Heysen’s country.” David Barker, exploring the
world from Bethlehem to the Spit, shows work
remarkable for its clear line; and much the same
can be said for that of Victor Cobb. Bruce Robert-
son is another with an extended outlook ; he brings
under contribution France, Scotland and Sydney.
Fullwood is mainly architectural, taking his cities
with fine impartiality from both sides of the world.
Hans Heysen has some charcoal studies of rustic
scenes; powerful enough, but not suggesting the
great artist that he is in color. Van Raalte’s work
has a local interest now that he has been asked to
come over as curator of the Adelaide Art Gallery.
His sombre scenes and heavy line are unmistakable,
and the occasional figures are unattractively Dutch.
Gay field Shaw and F. J. Campbell make up an
instructive show.
Adelaide shows are having a rush of
variety. An uproariously successful even-
ing was given to a packed house at the
Royal by the ’Varsity students, and the
same house has been occupied bv the Hum
phrey Bishop Co., which ought to be nt
the Exhibition Grounds, but went indoors
asking pathetically “When does your sum’
mer start?” (It is about the coldest’De-

Ada Cento and Dampier, who used long ago
to be a popular open-airist himself. Add to
these the Fuller bill twice a day at the
King’s, and the English Pierrots at Austral
Gardens m the moonlight, and this little city
of Starched Shirts and Propriety has plenty
°f choice in song-and-dance. At the York
is a big picture, “Man-Woman-Marriage ”
with the always effective device of a throw-
back at various points to show the same
people doing similar things at far-awav
periods of the world’s history. Priscilla
Dean also is strongly dramatic at West’s in
“Deputation.” At Wondergraph that fine
actor Meighan is a convict unjustly con-
demned, and Mary Miles Minter fills' in an
attractive bill.

Dorothy Beedham, who is one of artist
Uotteys prize pupils, is having an unobtru-
sive Sydney show of water-colors mixed in
with artistic lamp- and candle-shades and
calendars that face 1922 with an original
outlook. _ Some of these calendars bear
quaint devices in ti-tree bark. Of the can-
vases "Golden Glow” holds the most charm,
but there are some glimpses of the sunwashed
beaches of Bulli and Terrigal that, hung in
an enterprising land-agent’s office, would
positively grow gold for him. Dorothy is an’
exhibitor with the Royal Art Society, and is
represented in the National Gallery by two
etchings.
Sydney didn’t know whether to be sorry
or glad when it saw the great, unsightly
pile of buildings known as the P.F.A. stores,
next to Admiralty House, go up in flame and
smoke on Tuesday. Those stores were always
a mistake. A group of men, led by J. H.
Geddes, who thought that the wool and
other traffic of the North and North-West
would naturally come to the north side of
the Harbor when the railway connected
Hornsby and Milson’s Point, built this big,
square, many-storeyed barn overlooking
Circular Quay v But the railwav wasn’t
built round Kirribilli, and the expected
traffic wasn’t diverted at Hornsby, and for
many years the Pastoral Finance Co. had
as little love for these buildings as the
hundreds of thousands of people who, turn-
ing from the grassy slopes of the Botanic
Gardens and Government House on one side
of the Harbor to the huge factory and stores
on the other side, naturally regarded the
premises as an offence to the eye. But
there could be nothing but regret that at the
moment of destruction the stores should be
filled with high-priced pastoral products, so
that the total destruction will climb up well
towards the million.

“Peter”: Bryl Walkley, the pretty little
brunette who has suddenly shot to the front
as Jill-All-Alone in “Merrie England,” is
another instance of an Australian chorus
girl rapidly qualifying for a principal’s
salary. Bryl made her first appearance in
the background of “Bing Boys on Broad-
way,” and was next heard of in “The Pass-
ing Show,” warbling the solos in a couple of
song scenas. Later on she joined the Gil-
bert and Sullivan Co., and was alkwed pre-
liminary canters in a number of small parts,
whereupon Charles Wenman gave her a look
over and promptly declared her fit for .higher
things. She was born in Newcastle and is
another successful protegee of Mrs. Hugh
Ward.
“Peregrinatus”: Recently arrived un-
heralded in Melbourne, Elizabeth Baker, who
won some fame with her play “Chains.”
With her husband she is going to knock
about in the South Sea Islands, and they are
to stay three weeks in Sydney before moving
on to Auckland. She has been doing re-
views for the London Spectator for some
years, and play-writing is merely an accident
of her well-filled life.
“GOING UP," AT SYDNEY ROYAL.
Harry Wotton as a publisher and Field
Fisher as an aviation instructor.
‘O. Blin”: Though they played well
together in the first ,Australian production of
“A Royal Divorce,” Julius Knight and Ada
Ferrar never spoke off-stage, and generally
official communications were conducted by
correspondence. Knight,, who was a stickler
for details, one evening took exception to
Josephine’s color, which he alleged was too
high for a lonely female suffering from a
broken heart. As was the fashion, he next
day wrote to her Majesty in the following-
terms : “Mr. Knight presents his compliments
to Miss Ferrar and begs to suggest that she
put on too much color last night.” The reply
he received didn’t improve their social rela-
tions. “Miss Ferrar,” it ran, “returns Mr.
Knight’s compliments and begs to inform
him that the color complained of was merely
the natural blush of a lady forced to appear
with an actor who is not a gentleman.”
The Repertory Theatre in Adelaide, which
is proud of having been the first of its kind
in Australia, has called its supporters to-
gether to consider whether it shall disband,
proceed on different lines, or carry on as at
present, in which last case it will have to
find a lot more money. Talbot Smith, chair-
man of the Board, mentioned that it had
started modestly long ago (as the Literary
Theatre) at the University, and the popu-
larity which it gained had been a doubtful
benefit.’ The difficulties at present are
H.C.L. and the lack of a hall. Last trams
are earlier since the war, and a suburban
hall is no good to any other suburb. Every
hall in the city is occupied by “pictures,”
and theatres, when obtainable, charge ruin-
ously. Prof. Phillipson, who comes from
London with wide experience of such things,
urged going back to a small room —say at
the Conservatorium —and nlaying to sub-
scribers only; and the meeting resolved
unanimously to try this, instead of coming
down to “what the public wants” and trying
to be a commercial success.
“Pitt Streeter”: Phil Smith makes his
first appearance in petticoats in the Tait,
Bailey and Grant pantomime, “Sinbad,” and
should prove a satisfactory Dame, though really
good ones are few and far between. The
part of Sinbad’s nia in the same show was
played last season in Melbourne by Dan
Agar, a comedian who came from England
over two years ago, and has appeared in
only two productions in that time—“ The
Bing Boys on Broadway” and the aforesaid
“Sinbad.” The best pantomime artist seen
here of late years , was undoubtedly Barry
Lupino. His “old woman” was second to
none. Rumor has it that he will introduce
her to London at Drury Lane this Christ-
inas. If that happens I shall be surprised
if Lupino is not hailed as a second Dan
Leno in the part.
“Snell”: The wife of an actor-manager
well known in Melbourne and Sydney some
time ago had been for years persuading him
to let her play Juliet. She was 4 convinced she
was the Juliet of
the age, and when-
ever a great cold-
ness appeared
tween the boss and
his missus the com-
pany knew that
her ladyship had
had another 'out-
burst of ambition
ov e r-n igh t. At
length he suc-
cumbed, and she
played Juliet. In
the preceding play
she had made
rather a hit with
a sailor’s horn-
pipe ; hence hubby’s
concession. At the
end the gallery
would have Juliet
out before the cur-
tain. When she
came a stentorian
voi c e demanded :
“Now, then, do yer
step-dance! Give
us somethin’ for
our money.” In

den indisposition the lady’s daughter took
up the part right there.
“E.T.”: Frank Freeman, who jumped
from domestic comedy (“Tilly of Blooms-
bury”) to comic-opera (“The Maid of the
Mountains”), and is making his last appear-
ances in Australia in “The Laughter of
Fools” at Sydney Palace, goes back to Eng-
land early in the new year. By the same
liner, to try his luck in London, goes Pirie
Bush, who has put in a busy time here and
on American stages since he came over from
his native Maoriland some 10 years ago. An-
other “juvenile,”, William Greene, of the
J.C.W. comic-opera troupes, is bound for
the same destination. And yet one more
favorite, John D. O’Hara, threatens to take
the same journey shortlw
“Cornstalk”: Leonard Willey, who used
to strut in small parts with Julius Knight
and some years back went to ’Murka with
his wife, Irby Marshall, has made a hit in
N’York as Dan Taylor in “The Six-Fifty”
at the Hudson Theatre. Lolita Robinson
.(Mrs. Max Figman) also scores in the cast.
“Vandorian” (London) : Frank Hutchens
has been giving recitals in this village. He
chose the Aeolian Hall, a select and rather
modish place in Bond-street, where the electric
lights are disguised to look like wax-candles
topped by crimson silk shades. The M.L-
pianist, who is on leave from Sydney Conser-
vatorium, is steadily ascending the musical
scale in technique and style.
“Magnum”: When the Allan Wilkie co.
was playing “The Merchant of Venice” at
Broken Hill, and just as Bassanio was pon-
dering which casket held the lucky marble
for Portia’s hand, one of the gods earnestly
urged him to “try the lead one, cobber; it
ought to be lucky in the Hill.”
“Segui” ; Helen Fergus, the lady at Sydney
Grand Opera House whom Nellie Ferguson
calls “mum,” has been playing on the Aus-
tralian stage well over 30 years. She had
her first appearance in Calcutta as Lady
Macbeth, and one evening made a memor-
able entrance —with her pet ayah insisting
upon holding up her train. What Helen
said to nursie when she came off has never
been recorded.
“Middle Blue”: Eileen Cottey, Sydney
High School girl, who gave up the study for
the green-room, got her first chance as one
of the colleens in “Our Miss Gibbs.” She
was the most spirited thing in the old school
in Castlereagh-street about a dozen years
ago, and now she comes back from England,
where she has been getting good training at
the Shaftesbury and other theatres, to play
second boy in “Sinbad.”
“Cornstalk”: Young Reginald Long, who
has been playing character and boy
parts with Joseph Coyne recently, is
a smart English youngster who has
been in Australia for 12 years. Before
mumming he was an employee of Paling’s,
and his first part was with the Taits as an
office-boy in “The New Henrietta.” Since
then he has done good work with Allan
Wilkie, Maude Hanaford and Muriel Starr.
Incidentally, young Reginald has a sheaf of
one-act plays neatly tied up ready for trans-
port to foreign .markets when opportunity
offers.
“Ibenshaw”: Cromwell as hero is by no
means a novelty in English playwrights’
schemes, but such pieces have never yet
proved acceptable to theatregoers. Long
after George Rignold essayed to gain sym-
pathy for Oliver, Charles Cartwright—quite
as good an actor, though of an entirely oppo-
site temperament---appeared in London as
the lead in “Colonel Cromwell,” by novelist
Arthur Paterson ; but like the Rignold piece
the play failed to score. W. G. Wills, the
author of “Charles 1.,” written to the order
of Henry Irving and played in Australia by
his son, “II.B.,” made Cromwell a melo-
dramatic villain and Charles a saint, which
seemed to agree with audiences better —
Henry Irving audiences, that is. We may
rely on the adroit Drinkwater to give us the
happy medium —not too much history,’ but
just enough, as in “Lincoln.” By the way,
when are w*e to see the latter money-spinner
in Australia? It seems to be never out of
the bills in England and America.
“C. 8.”: Suggested by one wet week-end
after another, and with apologies to Handel:
And it shall rain for ever, and ev-er.
Um-brell-a! Um-brell-a!
“N. 8.” : On the flat next door to me here
at Richmond (Melb.) a merry-go-round man
has an out-of-the-w-ay side-line. He has
bought up a collection of rusty old “ordinary”
bikes —including the identical machine on
which Tom Busst rode to victory in the good
old days. At a charge of tuppence a time
for the privilege of riding them round the
flat, the queer old six-footers leave the
wooden horses in the shade.
“De Oriel” : I submit as the most remark-
able telegram address the one on a wire
recently received at the Melbourne G.P.O. —
“Rule Britannia.” It was for John Rule,
manager of the Britannia picture-theatre.
“Moe”: A puzzling feature about those
infant prodigies who are able to multiply one
row of figures by another “in their heads”
without ever making a mistake is the paucity
of their mental processes in other directions.
Several of the cleverest and most mathemati-
cally-accomplished of these lightning calcu-
lators have been otherwise semi-idiots, one
or two even complete idiots. Some years ago
a seven-year-old boy, a native of a N.S.W.
mining district, was unearthed by a theatri-
cal entrepreneur, and the first tests to which
he was submitted seemed to indicate that
he started in his calculations somewhere
about the point at which others left off.
Yet it was impossible to exhibit him on the
stage, or even before a much smaller audi-
ence, because his intelligence was so low
that he could not be taught even the simple
things necessary from the stage-presence
point of view. Another had no memory at
all:. his mind was a perfect blank regarding
the events of the week previous. Of course,
this does not apply to all lightning calcula-
tors, some of whom have quite normal brains.
Nevertheless, the majority furnish material
for research into the question why it is that
there is such a narrow margin between im-
becility and hyper-development of particular
cerebral centres.

“T. 0.1.”: Apropos John Hall Wilton (B.
1/12/’2l). He had been in the army and
served in India in the stirring years of
1838-43. His “Scenes in the Life of a Sol-
dier” was published by subscription in 1860,
and he had six other books to his credit.
“THE FROLICS OF 1921," AT
SYDNEY TIVOLI.
Gerald Harcourt calls for silence so that
Hector St. Clair may dispense injustice.
After leaving the army he travelled much,
earning the name of “Wandering Wilton.”
In the late ’forties he took a troupe of sax-
horn plavers to the United States, where he
met showman Barnum, who commissioned
him to negotiate an engagement with Jenny
Lind. It turned out a difficult job, but he
succeeded, and the Nightingale appeared in
America in 1850. Wilton came to Australia
in 1855 as avent with G. V. Brooke, and
remained with him until the tragedian
entered into partnership with George Cop-
pin. Wilton introduced Sir William and
Lady Don to Australia, but there was no
profit for him in the enterprise. After the
Barry Sullivan season at Melbourne Royal
he accompanied the tragedian to Sydney and
put up at Tattersall’s Hotel in Pitt-strcet,
kent by an ex-corporal of the 11th Regiment,
William O’Brien, while Sullivan put up at
the Royal. On December 19, 1862, Wilton
was found dead in bed at “Tatt.’s.” Suicide
was suggested, but William Dind and others
who knew the man scouted the idea. There
was no post-mortem examination, and a ver-
dict of death from heart failure was recorded.
He was buried in the Camperdown Ceme-
tery, near the graves of N. C. Bochsa (harp-
ist and friend of Anna Bishop), L. H.
Lavenu (composer and conductor and tutor
of Madame Carandini) and .Toe Wyatt
(builder of at least two Sydney theatres, The
Victoria and Prince of Wales).

is right. The wrong films are boosted.
Three of the best films I have ever seen
were “The Love That Lives,” “Wuthering
Heights” and “Cornin’ Through the Rye.”
One of the worst was “Straight from Paris.”
The first were unheralded and unknown
English pictures; the last an American
boost film.
THE GREATER PART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Tymms was young-, long years ago, a stage-
struck lad was he,
Who got into a third-class show as supernum’ary ;
He played the “knock upon the wall” and “crowd
outside the door,”
And, though his pay was rather small, you could not
call him poor.
When Tymms was young his mind was clear to
memorise his part;
The line, “My lord, the guests are here,” he quickly
learned by heart,
And so intelligent was he', his memory so deft,
That he could just as perfectly announce “The
guests have left.”
Now Tymms is old, his mind is dim, but he is quite
a sthr;
The managers just hand to him the fattest parts
there are.
But Tymms is poor and sad to-day, although he
draws big fees —
The greater part he pays away in prompters’ subsi-
dies.

HER ORIGINAL READING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Miss Scarlett came to Ballarat
To play artistic stuff;
The local critics fancied that
Her style was rather rough.
When as Ophelia she was billed
Brown went to see the fair,
And found her voice with hiccups filled
And vine-leaves in her hair.
“I like not your conception, Miss.
Your reading I deplore,”
He said; ‘‘l’ve studied close at this
For twenty years or more,
And one thing I will swear, my dear,
Though in your work to-night
You’ve hinted at it oft, I fear —
Ophelia was not tight!”
Miss Scarlett laughed a careless laugh
And threw her hair about,
And turned aside once more to quaff
A pint or so of stout.
“Ophelia not drunk, old Ziff!
I do not give a d —n,
My gentleman,” she stuttered, “if
She was or not —I am\”

A healthy man shouldn’t know
he has a liver Do you?
About the only thing which affects the
average healthy Australian—you, per-
haps—is a “liver attack.’’ You know
it—nausea; headache; heavy, lethargic
feeling; bad taste —sometimes dizziness
and vomiting. Your own fault!
Don’t ever take any credit for your
general health (your priceless posses-
sion). That’s a natural gift. But blame
yourself for the attack. That’s sheer
neglect.
Kruschen Salts (“Half-a-teaspoonful’’)
will certainly cure the attack. But their
best function is to prevent trouble.

Carlton had the biggest win in Melbourne
district cricket on Saturday. Closing with 2 for
252 (O’Keefe 127 n. 0.), they rocked" down Essen-

O Iveefe, who had batted without giving a chance
also took the bowling honors with 6 for 53 Mel-
bourne, who finished last week with 5 for 66, made
a bright recovery on Saturday by adding 163
tor the remaining wickets. Ransford (67) and
McDonald (65) were principally responsible for
Iloy s deficit of 90 on the first innings. South
managed to get 77 ahead of Richmond’s 177. Brere-
ton (60 n o.), Deas (55) and Park (45) saved the
game for the Red and Whites. P’ran have again to
be grateful for the services of Willis. Following
up his top score of 53 in the first hits against Haw“
thorn hast, he compiled 153 n.o. in the second
try. P ran, who led on the first innings by 52
were also helped by Wallace (5 for 40) and Grim-
mett (o for /2),. who dismissed the enemy for 122
Though University lost by 46 on the first hits
against N cote,- they sparkled up in their second
term and finished with 7 for 287. To this total

The cricket match between teams of cults
from Victoria and Soutli Aus. in Melbourne last week
ended in a win for the Vic. lads by 331. Starting-
off with 254, the Vies, piled up 399 for 4 (declared
closed) in their second turn, Woodful, a plodder

ing out his bat for an
unpicturesque 186 ; whilst
Atkinson, more sprightly
and enterprising, collected
125 before being caught
b v Poster off Gra v.
The S. Australians’ two
hands realised 129 and
183, Bartlett being top-
scorer in both sessions
with 34 and 55. The
only bowler who threat-
ened to havfe a future was
EssendoiTs young left-
hand e r, Conran, wh o
scored the brilliant double
of 5 for 36 and 5 for 28
on a wicket which was
not affected by the rain,
because it was covered
when not in use.
lhere was only one drawn game in' the
sixth round of Sydney grade cricket—’Varsity v.
Marrickville; and but one real sensation—Padding-
ton’s last-minute defeat of Mosinan. The supposedly
weak Manly team beat Gordon on the first innings",
and on going in again Gee (108) gave an exhibition
of fast scoring. But it was Bubb (5 for 30) and
Randall (5 for 41) who won the game for the Vil-
lagers. The only Gordonito to give a colorable
imitation of a batsman was Wells (23 n. 0.). Sydney
in two hits failed bv 20 runs to reach Waverlev’s
score. The Boneyarders were the onlv team to get
an “outright.” The Sydney batting wants a lot, of
stiffening. The consistent King (31) did not find
Stevehs (7 for 63) the holy terror his mates did.
Rock (117) played a lone hand for ’Varsity; his
protracted stay alone averted defeat. Marrickville
went after the runs, and Scott (51 n. 0.) assisted by
G. Thatcher (47) laid on the wood with particular
vigor. At, North Sydney, Myers (93) had to be
bowled, as the Randwick fieldsmen were without
their bags. Pennycuick (122) was still not out on
Norths declaration at 3 for 252. The visitors
shaped poorly against Eaton’s fast stuff —5 for 42
backed up by excellent fielding. JVlosman, 8 for
~~ jj. ® take tiie sporting chance and declare against
Paddington. Npble thereupon led his pupil Wells
to the wicket and pasted the alleged bowling to
such purpose that the Northerners crashed by 8
M ' A - N - 121 (n-o.), and Wells 120.
Wells left with 10 runs wanted, and O’Brien and the
veteran captain made up the deficit. Petersham

v A, ?.? at everything and were leniently treated
by the field. Gray’s 112, for Glebe against Balmain,
was not without blemish; but the effort won the
match. The Balmainiacs were unusually generous
in the field, and their crack left-hander and Camp-
ling, as they bowl for catches, suffered accordingly.
C. Cumberland’s moderate 174 was too many for
Wests. In this match, also, the fielding was very
third-rate. Wests played a sporting game and went
after the orehardists’ score. This suited Coogan, but
his of or o 6 might easily have been bettered. Norths
tead m the competition by 2 points from the Bone-
yarders, with Paddington, Wests and ’Varsity on
the next mark. Manly are tailed off.

S. A. Parliament was no match for a fairlv
strong XI that Governor Weigall brought against
it. For the Legislators Walter Duncan was top-
scorer with 39, and took the wickets of his Ex. and
his own brother, Duncan-Hughes. D. J. Gordon
who often played for the Press before going into
Parliament, made 32, and Premier Barwell and
Anthoney were the only others in double figures. The
Governor got Barwell and Gordon caught off his
bowling Clem Hill retired on making 40, and
bowled 3 for 31. The scratch team scored 187 for
5 wickets against Parliament’s 145. In another
match, against the Register, his Ex.’s XI had to
work much harder. Walter Duncan was playing for
R tms time, and made top score. The Governor
and his golfing A.D.C., Legh Winser, each made 20.
Hill was not playing.
T. Smith of Warwick (Q.), playing for
the Country r. the City at Brisbane last week, banged
(including 12 fours and a six) in 145 min. but

Jamito, who has made as many farewell
appearances as a middle-aged prima donna, greeted
a Sydney Stadium crowd once more on Saturday
night m collaboration with Ernie Symonds. TheV
got a great reception. Had points'been reckoned
on fouls the Englishman would have scored a run-
away victory. The reverse being the case the leather-
liued one romped home by rounds. As boxers there
is not much to choose between them, aiid in the
capacity to take punishment and come back hunger-
tnf w,’ nol 'f they a J. e "'ell matched; but Jamito is
the better stayer. Since tiie battle was waged at a
terrific pace from the gong this quality of endur-
ance left the 1 ilipino well in the ascendancy after
the half-way mark had been passed.

Kid Dale and Charlie Ring, two rising
hopes of the stern and unbending patrons of stoush,
guicd in a double bill at the Melbourne Stadium
at the week-end. Dale’s opponent was Chris Jordan,
sometime Vic. lightweight champion, who out-
pointed the youth in a willing 20-rounder—at least,
the referee said he had, although it was a dose
thing. But there was no doubt about the decision
in the other scrap, Ring leading Barney Thompson,
a seasoned middleweight, by a mile. The brand

Nine R.P.A.Y.C. craft turned out last
Saturday for the King Edward Cup. There was a

winner off the 20min. mark. Bona (Len Patrfck-

the last mile that but for a puff blowing his head-sail
back upon him on the line,he must have won. Spray
was third, a bare minute away. Kangaroo (R. Patter-
son), the N.S.W. State champion 10ft. dinghy, won
both the Test race and the Handicap on Saturday.
She will represent the Ma State in the 10ft. Aus-
tralian dinghy championship at Perth next January.

Lord Forster’s smart little boat, the
leuiba, had its first win on Hobson’s Bav on Satur-
day. Entering for the Brighton Club’s ‘ 10-mile off
the Middle Brighton pier, the Yeulba, with a handi-
cap of Bmin. 30sec.. beat the scratch boat, Eun-na-
Marn, by ssec.—a win that convinced the G.-G. of
his craft’s sailing qualities.
In the match against Yorkshire last week
Watkins and Capies did not strip for the Kan-
garoos; Carstairs filled Horder’s position as winger -
Fraser played five-eighth, vice Caple.s, and Banana-
lander Richards bogged in alongside Lattnl, while
Schultz and Prentice re-appeared to assist 1 Pearce
in the front row. For the county Wagstaffe, Rogers,
Parkin, Stone and Gallagher—all members ; of the
team that played here, in 1920—took the field. It
was a grim struggle until shortly before lemons,
when the Northerners led by 8 to 7. About then
Gibson, the noted “rake” of Hull Kingston Rovers,
left injured, and Yorkshire began to fail, losing
eventually by 24 points to 8. For some years pre-
vious to this season none but native-born Tykes have
been eligible to represent Yorkshire. On this occa-
sion the convention was evidently overlooked. Johnny
itogers is a Welshman and Stone comes from
Gloucester. The match on Saturday was against
Wales, at Pontypridd. Horder re-appeared; Caples
a i T.i^ sei l, were r ®Pl ace d by Johnson and Norman,
and McGrath went in alongside Pearce vice Prentice,
lne Welsh XIII, drawn from all quarters of the
Noi them Union area, included Ben Gronow, Hur-
combe and Rogers, of Wagstaffe’s 1920 visitors, and
Havies, who vice-captained the Northern Union
tourists of 1914 under the same skipper. The
Aussies booted off in the rain with the wind, and
by the half-time breather had rattled up 16 points
to 7. On the change round Wales out-played the
Aussies back and for’ard, but could do no better
than 9 points to the visitors’ 5. It was anybody’s
game, though. McKivatt’s 1912 menagerie wal-
loped the Taffiies by 28 to 20.

Bowling Club.
(N.S.W.). He won
Victorian champion-
ships in 1899 and 1900
and the N.S.AV. title in
1914 ; gained the Aus-
tralian amateur title by
defeating Michael Scott
(1904) and Erie
Apperly (1911) ; and
later was secretary to
the Australian Golf
and Leura clubs. The
Big Job against the
Hun left him sadly
wrecked, and Peace
only came for him on
Saturday. He was 43.
The Manly Summer Cup attracted most
ot N.S.W. s crack goffers on Saturday. T. E.
Howard won with 72: out 35 and in 37. He holed
a long putt on the short seventh for a two, missed
a short putt on the twelfth and took three putts on
the short thirteenth. His tee shot at the eighteenth
round a bad lie, and at this hole he could do no
better than five. On the whole, though, his play was
steady, and there is no doubt he stands out as the
leading amateur stroke performer in Australia to-day.
W. C. Thurrock got round in 75, which, considering
he only plays at week-ends, was an effort full of
merit.

G. G. Aitlcen, M.L.V latest Rhodes
scholar, hails from Victoria College, Wellington,
aTid is the first international to go to Oxford from
the Windy Isles. After representing North Island
last season he came to Australia as centre-three-
quarter for the Combined M.L. Universities’ team,
au ?, n ki s return played in the same possie against
the Springboks. He is bound to get his Rugger
blue before the end of this (English) season, a gar-
ment which is already in the possession of Eorsayth
and Bettington (Sydney King’s) and Tommy Lawton
(Brisbane Grammar).

On Saturday at Roseliill, Greenstead
again showed the scorn a good horse has of mere
weight. Carrying lOst. 51b. in a field of smart
sprinters, to some of which he was conceding 491 b.,
the old chap was rather slow to leave the mark, but
travelling along the outside he was with the first
flight at the turn. Over the last furlong he put in
a brilliant run and, catching Gambler’s Gold, won
by a long head. It was the best sprinting effort
seen at Rosehill since Poitrina’s day. Greenstead
was again ridden by the apprentice Cracknel], whom
he prefers, apparently, to anyone except Myles Con-
nell, and he ran the six in 134.

James Lee, of Molong (N.S.W. ), who died
last week, aged 94, inherited his love of thorough-
breds from his father. To such an extent did he
specialise in them that at Lanas Lake aristocrats
whose lineage on both sides could be traced into
the mists of time were habitually used. for boundary-
riding, water-carrying and hacking' to the townships.
Phoebe, four times winner of the Doncaster, was
bred by James Lee; and he struck many another
good one in his long life, though he never had the
luck in this line of his brother George, on the
Bathurst side.

There s so much horse- and pony-racing
around Brisbane in the daytime that one club has
decided to get its chop at night, and the electric-
light wires are now being hoisted around the re-
cently-formed Cooperoo pony-track. A problem that
has been staggering one-half of Queensland for manv
months is where t’other half gets its punting-money,
and scenting retrenchment the result of successful
competition, the Amalgamated Union of Pak-a-pu,
Betting-shop and Golden Casket Employees is con-
sidering the question of making a concerted move
against the new gamble. If the union fails and the
promoters can only synchronise their dates with
pay-nights there should be a fortune in it.

At S. Canterbury the other day Baronet
George Clifford, the G.O.M. of M.L. racing, scored
a third in the Juvenile Handicap (Dame Strait-
lace), seconds in the Big Handicap (Purple Spur)
and Stewards’ Welter (Counterstroke), and won the
Trial (Brave peed) and Hack Welter (Whipping
Boy). T Te didn’t trouble the hurdles.

New racing ventures in Adelaide have no
luck. The Oakbank Easter Monday meeting is such
a success that a second day in the year was at last
tried. It had a disastrous wet day at the opening-
attempt ; and a repetition this year was not well
attended. Now the Adelaide Hunt Club has broken
out into a second day. But Morphettville is booked
for all the few occasions S.A. law allows on one
course, and the club had to go to Port Adelaide. Of
course there was no Hunt Cup. The social element
of the Hunt meeting was not present, the afternoon
was c °ld and stormy, and altogether the club had
little reason to be pleased with the experiment.
At the Bananaland Turf Club’s Summer
Meeting, Fairy Bob preferred tackling the compara-
tively weak field in the Southport Handicap (ljm.i
to again taking a licivlng from the Derby winner
Lawn Mower, in the w.f.a. Stanley Plate, over the
same distance, (lie won this race last year from
Lari Kitchener and Molly’s Robe.) The arrange-
ment met with success, but the Flying Machine colt
was downed by the outsider Nairn (Cooltrim-Sar-
saparilla). The third horse (Ladomond), and only
other starter, was 10, lengths astern.
At Queensland amateur cycling champion-
ships on Saturday Les Munro took the mile (2min.
26sec.) and five miles (12min. 18sec.). He holds
the 10-mile and 25-mile road championships in the
Northern State, and will ride for Australasia against
the Springboks.

The jumping was the feature of the final
day of the Dunn Shield (club championships) at
Sydney on Saturday. In the hop, step and jump, a.
W. Winter (South Sydney) won with 49ft. 81 in.
which eclipsed his own Shield record by 18Jin., and
made new Australasian figures. Leo Gabriel—a re-
cruit who will improve—did 46ft. 9Jin. In the
high the brothers Harbison divided with sft. lOlin.
The figures equal A. H. Scott’s Shield record. Rov
Harbison divided with J. Manning last year. George
Parker led all the way in the mile walk, to win
by 7yds. from Ernie Austen in 6min. 50 3-ssec., or
2 4-ssec. better than A. W. Pickard’s figures. E. W
Carr won the 220yds. decisively in 22 2-ssec., and
as he also took the 100yds. left no doubt about his
claim to being the fastest sprinter in the State.
The destination of the Shield was in the balance
till W. Porter romped home in the three-miles flat
and gave East Sydney’ the trophy with 34 points
against University’s 324 points and South’s 12.
After the meeting the A. A. A. selectors chose
the N.S.W. combination for the Australasian cham-
pionships meeting: E. W. Carr (sprints), W. Hutton
(quarter and half-mile), F. W. Edwards (hurdles),
Dug Munro and A. Reid (field games), Roy Harbison
and R. J. Honnor (jumps), and George Parker
(walks).

J. A. Newman, the Melbourne Grammar
distance ped., ought to leave many behind him in
the forthcoming Australasian championships in Adel-
aide. In the Mile Championship on the Melbourne
Amateur Sports Ground last Saturday he beat the
Vie. and Commonwealth champion, W. H. Brown, by
syds. in 4min. 37sec. Brown looked like winning
50yds. from home, but the youngster had plenty of
steam in reserve, and running gamely overhauled
the other in 25yds. Another surprise was the de-
cisive defeat of the 100yds. expert, D. W. Gale, bv
another ’Varsity sprinter, H. Nicol, in lOsec. Gale,
who just staggered home in his heat, was unplaced
in the final, Nicol getting the verdict by three-
quarters of a yard.

H. E. Wilson, Australasia’s greatest
hurdler, covered 120yds. in 15sec. at Wellington
(M.L.) last week. Last year the nuggetty Maori-
lander won the 120yds. Australasian hurdles cham-
pionship at Sydney in 15 9-10 sec., and the M.L. cham-
pionship in 15see. A dip in the track kept the
latter figures off “the book.’’ On another occasion
he was credited with 14 3-ssec., which also missed
official status. Wilson won the rare 120yds. army
hurdle championship (16 2-ssec.) at Aldershot in
1918, Last week’s effort equalled the world’s
figures, and is 3-10 sec. improvement on the Austral-
asian figures held by George Keddell, G. Gray and
Ric Templeton. It is a calamity that this true
champion cannot meet the Springboks in the coming
championships at Adelaide.
Ettie Robertson, the 13-yer.r-old swimming
marvel of Plunkett-street School, Sydney, won the
All-Schools’ 100yds. championship last week against
girls of all ages. Last Thursday, at Coogee, in the
100yds.’ senior event of Sydney Ladies’ Club, she
put up the remarkable time of lmin. 19sec. Piri
Page, the schoolgirl champion of Maoriland, has
equalled these figures, but then she is considerably
more than 13.
At the senior cadets’ carnival in Drum-
moyne (Sydney) baths on Saturday, Alan Penfold
(Manly) won the 100yds. championship in 63
l-ssec., Stan O’Connor the 200yds. in 2min. 35sec.,
and A. Stuart the 50yds. (1906 quota) in 29 4-ssec.
The gathering at which these slippery times were
put up is to be an annual affair.
France is to stage the 1924 Olympic
Games in three distinct acts. Winter sport will he
held in January at Chamounix, 3000 ft. above sea-
level and beneath the shadow of Mont Blanc. Rugby
and Soccer will occur in April, and all other sports
at Paris in July. Australia will, of course, be there.
“Ibis” : I was a member recently of a
visiting XI which took on an outlying settlement on
the N.S.W. Irrigation Area. On arrival we hobbled
our mokes near the pavilion— -a couple of logs—
while the pitch was mowed. Of course there was no
matting. The stumps were then hewn (from the
pavilion) and we, having won the toss,
went in. The bowling was fast, we had
no pads, and the wicket-keeper was without
gloves. A Bonnor would have been incapable of
driving the ball more than a dozen yards, such was
the length of the grass. In the circumstances the
scoring was low and as each defeated batsman
returned he was greeted by the grandstand with
well-known poultry-yard calls. When the wicket was
hit the umpire would hammer in the stumps afresh
with an axe, which was lying conveniently near.
The field employed the respite picking grass-seeds
from their 'socks and trousers. The game was eventu-
ally declared a draw, our umpire having been
bitten by a snake; and if anyone can beat this as
an example of sport undertaken in a determined
manner in the face of heavy disabilities I shall have
pleasure in giving him the lie direct.
“Merew”: It takes a lot to put some
Australians off their swim. Three seasons ago a
shark took for keeps a leg belonging to Douglas
Ark ell, of .Newcastle (N.S.W.) ; but he still risks
the other leg regularly in the surf, and besides
that has managed to win several swimming handi-
caps with it.
PEACE VERSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One of the results of the Irish agreement is that
a syndicate proposes to start a casino at Killarney.”
Oh, Paddy dear, and did ye hear
The news that’s goin’ round?
They’re starting a casino on
Killarney’s sacred ground.
’Tis the most injaynious notion
That ever you could find:
We’re to win the Saxon tourists’ gold
For the raisin’ of the wind.
I met wid Napper Tandy,
And he took me by the hand.
Said he: “You’ve heard the splendid news?
Bedad, it beats the band!
I can hear the groans of Sassenachs,
And their eyes wid tears are blind,
As a Sinn Fein ‘bank’ lifts English gold
For the raisin’ of the wind.’’
When the Church steps in and stops the joke
’Twill be soon enough to grievr.;
In the meantime let us not delay
But for Killarney leave,
And we will bet the limit
At games of ev’ry kind,
Until the day do pass away
For the raisin’ of the wind.

The jazz is king. Somewhere abouthalf-way
through the musical programme at a' recent
charity fete the smart lady in charge com-
manded the well-known warbler who was
running the music section to ring down the
curtain. "But,” wailed the singer, “I want
you first to hear Miss Blank’’- —mentioning
a leading contralto who had offered to star
for him and charity. “We don’t want to
hear Miss Blank or anyone else sing,” re-
plied the matron—“we are going to dance!”
With fury in their hearts Miss Blank and a
couple of other pros., having unexpectedly
discovered exactly how much their services
were appreciated, picked up their music-
rolls and fled.
With rugged and popular McLachlan as
cicerone, the Earl and Countess have been
visiting Bairnsdale, Lindenow, Sale, Sea-
spray, Maffra, Stratford and other points of
of interest. A kangaroo hunt at Stradbroke
was one of the items on the programme.
The Countess, in black velvet and pearls,
came punctually at 9 o’clock to Mrs.
Leslie Stuart’s dance for the City Newsboys’
Fund. The lady jazzed continuously till 2
in the mornin’, and then gathered up “three
balloons for the children.” A cherry-chif-
foned Lady Helena and aide Keppel Palmer
, of the frivolous toe also joined cheerily in
the jazz. Mrs. Stuart gave the dance at
Logan House to save expenses for the fund.
She was backed up by secretary Dr. Gordon
McAdam and a committee. The whole house
was turned over to the invaders (at a guinea
a head) ; the good nature of host Leslie
Stuart even went the length of letting the
committee move his precious billiard-table to
make room for more crowds. Could a man do
more? Mrs. Leslie wore the new kind of
neck-to-knee dress in heavy black lace. (The
latest cry is to have an evening-gown which
covers the back right up to the base of the
coiffure.) The two school-girl daughters, in
Venetian red from neck to toe, sold cigarettes
for the fund. Mrs. Geoff. Syme, a generous
committee woman, was gowned in gorgeous
brocade of dull silver woven into lacquer
red, and daughter Mardi wore tender lime
color. Two Bowes Kelly girls wore twin
frocks of green chiffon hung from gold corse-
lets. Mrs. Langlands Thompson, in ivory
white, had some wonderful seed pearls woven
in a design of flowers. Mrs. Nelken appeared
in her gorgeous wedding gown. The jazzing
was so strenuous that relays of bands were
engaged. Early Miss Harding’s delicate
orchestra played the Blue Danube and sweet
old waltz tunes, but near midnight Maurice
Guttridge arrived with his Jazbo band and
the latest shriek in toe-tickling music. The
affair was crowded and will bring in a nice
cheque for the fund, even though the Naicest
did find it queer to be buying their way into
the - most hospitable Stuart homestead.*
Melba appeared triumphantly at her first
Concert-for-the-People in a radiant gown of
bright green. She looked younger than ever.
The house was so enthusiastic that it almost
swamped her final notes in its applause.
The ball given by Mrs. William Green
and daughter Florence at the Town Hall to
help the Homoeopathic Hospital, the Found-
ling Home and the Hebrew Ladies’ Benevo-
lent Asylum was notable. The onlookers,
who booked up the balconies, had crowded
the hall by 6.30, and the show, beginning at
7.30, was kept a-whirl until after midnight.
The Countess was among the Importants
who came to watch. There was a grand
symbolical pageant headed by Miss Rossiter
as the Angel of Peace. Britannia’s Court
was led by Britannia in the person of Dr.
Lane’s'handsome youngster Gwen, .and Mrs.
Stein’s two children were Australia and Vic-
tory. Afterwards came lialf-a-hundred
dances. Dora Hawthorne-Tait, in an Indian
Temple turn, showed professional skill, and
a Blue Butterfly ballet of youngsters justi-
fied Genee’s praise of Australian footwork.
Lois Green, from Westralia, was convincing
in her swan dance, and Joan Solomon
stepped the Golden Flower of the Sun in a
way to make theatrical managers take notice.
At the finish of the exhibition items the
jazzers cut loose on ballroom dancing. The
Green Ball is an annual event, but it was
never more successful than this year.
The Tivoli is a Sassiety haunt these days.
Last week the Chirnsides graced one box and
the Fenners' another, while the Ledinghams
and Wynnes were stalled to hear Ella
Shields. Musgrove is putting much more vim
into the Tivoli circuit’s vaudeville. East
week he flitted over to Adelaide to see the
new theatre there get its start, and took
with him the baton-brandishing Guttridge,
who came from abroad originally to produce
“Irene” and has lately been drawing atten-
tion to himself by his orchestra work here.
Helped by Nora Delaney, Kirby gave two
concei ts at Government House at the fete for
the City Newsboys, and bagged £26 for the
two events. One programme ran from 2
till 3.30, and the other from 4 till 5. The
Countess particularly congratulated violinist
Meg Macdonald and Miss Reid on their
work.
Walter Kirby got a great house for his
recital the other night. The' Princess’s
Theatre was crowded from stalls to gallery,
and the Very Naicest motored up in droves.
Supported by pianist Bourguignon, the tenor
was most generous with encores, and put
two or three new Australian songs before
the house. The crowd rose up in enthusi-
asm and decorated him with laurel wreaths
and other vegetables. Afterwards he was
entertained at supper in the new Treasury
Hotel, where 60 ~uests drank his health.
Mrs. B. Nathan lent her' Rippon ball-
parlor to the Ministering Children’s League
to meet the Nora Delaney-Maxwell dame
and Ella Shields —a kind of postscript to
the previous Saturday’s fete, which was half
washed away by the rain. The crowd cheer-
fully bought up all the left-over stocks, paid
their shillings for afternoon-tea, and met
with the due reward when Ella Shields, all
smiles, becoming white chiffonery and a rose-
red hat, offered to sing for them. And she did
it three times, once to her own accompani-
ment. Howls of appreciation followed her
final item, the old war classic, “Back to
Yarrawonga.” This, she explained, was
given her by ex-Corporal Mcßeath, “and,”
added Ella with a twinkle, “I’m trying it
on the —well; you all know the rest of the
quotation!” The Nora Delaney-Maxwell
voice had scratched for the afternoon owing
to a sore throat.
Mary Mack, daughter of squatter Joseph
Mack, of Berrybank, in the Western district,
is to marry Digger lan Gillespie on January
26. lan is a son of J. M, Gillespie, who con-
tracted an 0.8. E. after strenuous work with
the Red Cross. Mary Mack, who won an
Ormond Scholarship with her voice, has been
on the staff of the University Con., but the
trousseau puts an end to that. The marriage
will be in Scots’ Kirk, with a wedding-
party to follow at Scott’s Hotel.
This photo by Navana (Lond.) is the
latest version of our nice-looking singer,
Gertrude Johnson,
who, after making
Australia rather
eager for her in
grand opera, folded
her tent and stole
off to Europe. Hun-’
dreds of friends
have been wondering
how T she was shaping
at the head-centre
of artistic things,
and now gratifying
news is to hand.
Gertrude Johnson is
doing particularly
well. Her hands are
full of concert en-
gagements. She has
made frequent ap-
pearances at the
Sunday League concerts, which represent a
big musical movement in London, and when
the mail left was under contract to sing the
leading soprano part in “The Creation” in
Yorkshire, and the role of Marguerita in
“Faust” at the Warrington Musical Festival;
ar.d she was singing at the’ Enoch concerts
throughout the summer. In the Sunday
League concerts she had the distinction of
following Calve and being greeted with eulo-
giums equal to those bestowed upon the,great
contralto. Horace Stevens, the Australian
pianist, is working with Miss Johnson, who
joyously reports that her successes are be-
yond her best expectations.
A. R. Wiltshire, who collected the C.M.G.,
D.S.O. and M.C. as a youthful colonel in
command of the 22nd Battalion in France,
has handed a lialf-hoop of diamonds to Jean
Morrison, daughter of the late Dr. Morrison
of Ballarat, and niece of “Chinese” Morri-
son, who died a while back in Pekin. The
brklegrobm-to-be is well known in Euroa,
where his late dad toiled in the Anglican
vineyard for many placid years.
The Herbert Power widow’s second daugh-
ter, Gladys, lately back from Asia, is prepar-

trousseau. She will sail back in February
to Shanghai, where she has made a date
with Frank Marriot, a good-looking six-foot
Englishman of 40, who took up business in
China after gaining some, experience in
Bananaland. The bride-elect is a pocket
Venus with a pretty wit which never
bubbles over unkindly.
Mrs. Power and her three daughters, who
have been sheltering in South Yarra, are

groom, I at Shute, a real broth of a six-foot
boy with blue eyes and a bit of a brogue—all of
winch the lucky girl picked up in India a
couple of years ago when visiting with Aunt
Margaret.

whereat the Gaud Mayor will take the lead!
xiaving been parishioners of his when he was

and her Ex. will have him and his dame as
guests for a few days. Dozens of addresses
are to be pelted at the poor man, but he
needn t believe every word.
Mayor M. T. Cullinan was in his element
in welcoming the Stradbrokes to Sale when
they arrived the other night. He is the most
popular Irish-Australian in the district, and
is a link between sections that might other-
wise be antagonistic. The “great news”
about the Irish Free State was perhaps re-
sponsible for the fine finishing touches which
were put into the reception arrangements.
Mrs. Merrie Cowle, of Mount Gambier
(S.A.), has been spending some weeks in
Melbourne, and Mrs. Collins gave a big lun-
cheon in her honor at the Quamby Club the
other day. Mrs. Cowle was a Tasmanian
singer of note before she heard the call of
matrimony.
Septimus Power has been brightening the
walls of the Athenaeum with an exhibition
of paintings during the week. The whole
collection goes to Sydney in a few days.
When Kyabramapootra was crowing its
loudest ID years ago the stocks of the civil
servant were low, particularly around the
that contained the “little three.”
I oliowing the fashion, an Irish farmer, who
reared porkers, said to a State-school teacher
a descendant of a Munster man —when he
met him on sale day: “If it wasn’t for the
likes of me you’d bfe humpin’ yer
swag lookin’ for a job.’’ “If . ye’ll listen
to any wan of yer pigs whin' ye get’ back
home to-day he’ll tell ye the same thing,”
replied the pedagogue. The yarn was re-
vived the other day when Alec Peacock, a
political victim of the hectic times of 1902,
blew into the districts surrounding Ivyabram
and was, in atonement for the past, received
with open arms.
A young Sassiety Adonis lately went into
the Back of Beyond to grow wheat. Straight
from the vortex of the toniest jazz haunts he
found himself at his first country dance
pirouetting with a local belle in a waltz that
belonged to the time of great-grandma. After
one round his partner pouted : “I’m awfully
surprised you haven’t learned to dance in
Melbourne—l heard everybody danced there.”
Adonis, the adored of Carlyon parties, nearly
fainted.
Recently while on exhibition here Rowell’s
“Auntie Bella” (which was recognised by
The Bulletin as one of the best portraits
of the year) caught the eye of Geelong’s
Mayor Hitchcock, and as president of the
Geelong Gallery he recommended its pur-
chase, heading the subscription-list with a
fat donation.
Mary Emilie Anthoness, better known as
Sister Emilie, who has just been tucked
away in Melbourne General Cemetery, won
the title of “friend of the poor.” She was
attached to the Central Methodist Mission,
but was no wowser. Her sympathies were
broad, and she had a way with the unfor-
tunate. met at the City Court or elsewhere,
that made her a big influence in “social”
work. The heart-aches of her passing were
not felt by the Methodies only, nor the
brands plucked from the burning, but were
shared by cynics who are probably irredeem-
able.
N. S. Wales Governor Davidson, in a pre-
face to the book of airman Raymond Parer,
mentions the extreme modesty of the bird-
man, but remarks that even his reticence
cannot veil the greatness of his adventure.
Miss Charlwood, a Vic. pen-woman, has
edited and put together the book, of which a
limited number of copies will be ready for
Christmas—the full issue has been delayed
by paper troubles. Parer is at present
dodging about South Australia, getting bis
’bus in trim before looking for more clouds to
conquer.
Melbourne Hospital got the biggest slice
of the £29,0i)0-odd collected on Hospital
Saturday and Sunday and on Countess
Stradbroke’s Day. It was allotted £6572.
The Alfred came next with £3056, and then
followed the Women’s, £2317; St. Vincent’s,
£1995; Austin, £1986; and Homoeopathic,
£1989. As usual, all the charities are hard
up and can/ do With what they are getting
and a bit more.
This is tenor George Brooke, who plays
David to pianist Ed-
ward Cahill’s Jona-
than. The pair of
Northerners have
been much in re-
ouest at smart musi-
cal at-homes, and
what with engage-
ments and a benefit
given them at the
Assembly Hall, the
trip to Europe in
search of more cul-
ture has been made
easy. And as Dame
Clara Butt and our
own Dame Nellie
are befriending them,
their path on the
other side shouldn’t
be difficult either.
The Foundling Hospital is clamoring for
£lO,OOO, which simply must be scraped to-
gether for sheer repairs, as well as additional
buildings and an endowment fund. Gaud-
Mayor Swanson is hand-and-glove with
Countess Stradbroke in the big drive, and
hon. organiser Les Bruford is the Dan
Kelly of the gang. The abandoned mites
whose lives depend upon the tender mercies
of the Berry-street home are not always
in rags or a mere newspaper when they
arrive there, so it is a very excellent sugges-
tion that all anonymous fathers should pass
round the hat for this appeal.
Dame Nellie has been staying in town a
good deal lately, the Occidental housing her.
A coo-ee from Adelaide: —
The resignation of his Ex. is really a blow to
us. No vice-regal couple were ever as popular as
Sir Archibald Weigall and his wife, so thoroughly
have they adapted themselves to the democratic
spirit of the country; and they have achieved more
in their 18 months than many others have in five
year;.
A.B.C. Nigel Somerset is to marry Fifi Irwin
in Melbourne at the end of March, and as the vice
regal departure takes place in April the young
couple will be travelling to the Cold Country at
the same time.
A visit of Billy Hughes was one of the happen-
ings of last week. He attended a luncheon given
to the departing High Commissioner by F. B.
Moulden, the retired Mayor, and in the evening
the Town Hall was too small to hold the crowd
anxious to hear him talk. Arrangements had been
made for this spell-binding by the then Mayor, so
Cohen graciously called upon Moulden to preside.
After the meeting Mayor Cohen and his Mayoress
gave his Ex., Lady V/eigall, the visitor, aldermen,
councillors and their women folk refreshment in the
reception-room. Next morning Billy was up bright
and early and did a gallop round Victoria Park race-
course.
After the Moulden luncheon to the High Com-
missioner last week, the guests went to the Mayor-
ess’s reception-room, at the invitation of Mayor
Cohen, and, after the occasion had been explained,
joined him in the annual ceremony of drinking to
the memory of Colonel Light, the first Surveyor-
General and town-planner of Adelaide. The Mayoress
and her daughters then entertained the 200-odd
guests at afternoon tea.
The attendance at Tattersall’s meeting at Mor-
phettville suffered owing to the Polo Club’s tri-
angular match at Birkalla falling on the same date.
Society rolled up to the latter in full force. Host
Frank Downer provided tea for the fair in a
marquee, and stronger stimulants for the frail in
the clubhouse. The latest engaged couple were
among those present—Dr. T. G. Wilson and Mrs.
Douglas Murray.
A woman professor, Annie Heloise Abel, is here in
search of “local color.’’ She is a Prof, of History at
Smith University, Mass, U.S.A.- —a group of six large
institutions devoted to the higher education of
women. Her present aim is to find a resemblance
between the earlier colonisation of the Atlantic
seaboard and the later settlement here.
And then we’ve got a lady minister —is she a
clergy woman ?—visiting Adelaide. She is the Rev.
E. Rosalind Lee, and was a student at Newn-
ham College, Cambridge, before she received
her B.A, degree at Dublin; and last year
she was awarded the Hibbert scholarship and
studied for a session at Harvard ’Varsity, U.S.A.
She threatens to preach to us, too. Not that we
haven’t heard eloquent pulpit-ladies before. We
actually owned one for many years—Mrs. Lake, the
wife of one of former Chief Justice Way’s Bible
Christian friends.
Laycock, an Adelaide stonemason, has given his
verdict on the local marble. Excellent for general
purposes, he calls it, but not satisfactory for figure-
work. So, having commissions for two war mem-
orials, he recommended the two towns concerned
to import the statuary. Thus Orroroo and Wirrabara
will hand down to posterity ideal figures of Bill-
jim produced by an unknown Italian carver at
second-hand from a batch of photographs!

Palmolive tempers the sun
and wind to the tender cheek
WHEN “summer skies are darkly blue”
the Australian woman seeks the drench-
ing sunlight of the beach and the bush.
Now, more than ever, does she appreciate the
luxury and benefit of the creamy foam of mild
Palmolive Soap.
Fierce sun and harsh wind play havoc with
tender skins. Palmolive takes the sting out
of summer and keeps the skin of infant and
adult soft and cool and free from irritation.
A skin can be healthy and blooming only when
its pores are clean and able to perform their
vital functions.
Palmolive Soap—containing Palm and Olive
oils, those wonderful soothing and healing
cosmetics discovered by the wise old Egyptians
—is the finest cleanser and safeguard of a
tender and delicate skin.
Wash the face gently with the velvet, creamy
lather of mild Palmolive and massage it softly
into the skin. When this foam is rinsed away,
it carries off the impurities which clog the
pores and are the foundation of skin infection
and disfigurement.
Palmolive is at
once a cleanser,
a tonic and a
balm, Though
so thorough and
beneficial in ac-
tion, it is as
gentle and mild
as a zephyr,
Palmolive clean-
liness is different.
You will appreci-
ate it.

AWOMAN'S
LETTER
Holeproof
Hosiery
Who said fairies? The pied piper of
Christmas whispered it down the breeze, and
immediately from every doorway in city and
suburbs the children poured o ut, and the
combined joy and torment of Christmas shop-
ping was in full swing. The aisles and lifts
in the stores are possessed of small girls and
boys who move slowly and stare long; am
in spite of the trade depression which is said
to encompass us, limousine dolls and luxuri-
ous teddy bears smile a high-priced invita-
tion. At Farmer’s Goldilocks and’the three
Australian Bears draw hundreds of kiddies
every afternoon to the mannequin theatre.
The children taking part are delightful, and
if the songs and the grown-up element don’t
fit into the picture verv well, the round-eyed
youngsters suffer them because presently old
friend Santa Claus is going to pos> down the
stage chimney billowing with balloons. Why
poor old Santa is represented arriving to the
tinkle of sleigh-bells and wrapped in crimson
cloth when any youngster in the audience
knows that the only ice about on Christmas
Eve is in the ice-chest, and that anyone
swathing himself so at that time of year
would fall dead with apoplexy, is a mystery
that can never be explained. Surely in all
his journeyings Santa might have picked up
a nice lightweight suit. David Jones present
Cinderella and her Glass Slipper to their
patrons, who are equally crowdful and en-
thusiastic. Punch and Judy shows and
Chrifttmas-trees sprout in every shop. School
prizes and kindergarten parties strew rose-
netals over the days, and Tiny Tim’s prayer
folds its wings about the hearts of all.
But, oh, the clashing of the foot-traffic in
the city streets! A couple of months ago the
police decided to introduce the rule of “Keep
to yofir left,” and splashed the pavements
with notices to that effect. Since then life
for the law-abiding who are able to keep on
disremembering old habits has been full of
bruises and delays, until in desperation they
either risk death in the carriage-way or go
with the crowd on the wrong side of the
footpath. For a month or so bored-looking
constables attempted to control the traffic
on a few central blocks ; now not even there
is a serious effort made. The result is a
confusion such as Sydney hasn’t known
before. A mere woman would say that the
new rule should be either enforced or aban-
doned. But, then, mere woman is so prac-
tical.
There was a great roll-call of War-
riors’ Day campaigners at the Wentworth
last Friday night for the final effort in aid
of the Diggers’ Christmas stocking. Posies
of the different battalion colors were distri-
buted, and some of the tables had been strik-
ingly decorated in a beloved son’s or
brother’s colors. One of the gayest tables
was presided over by Mrs. Jessica Lee.
whose guest-list had an international flavor
—it included the Consular Campanas, Mrs.
Arthur Jewett and Mrs. Fiaschi. Dame
Alice Chisholm, who was president of the
dance, wore a charming black-satin dress
and entertained legions of friends. _ There
were prizes -for everything. The six best-
dressed women in the room each carried
home a colored print of “Rorke’s Drift”;
Roy Bryce, and his partner Miss Doig an-
nexed the prize for the old-fashioned waltz;
and P. S. Susman not only polkaed-better
than any other young man, but also won
the Limerick competition, in which effort
Nita Macrae ran second. Edith Hill,
dressed in the blue that is knowm as raven’s
wing, fed manv Elijahs, the Geoffrey Fair-
faxes and Alison MacConnick among them ;
and another present was Justice Wade’s
lady, surrounded by her married daughters
and almost brand-new sons-in-law.
The big noise of the week vibrated through
a packed Conservatorium on a hot, still
night. The teaching staff had de-
cided to show Sydney that Oscar Wilde
didn’t know when he said “Those. who can,
do; and those who can’t, teach” ; so the
professors kept the stage to themselves, and
introduced a collection of modern music to
Sydney students. Arthur Benjamin and
Henry Penn started out with Rachmaninoff,
Gladstone Bell’s ’cello rhapsodised in a work
of Eugene Goossens, Alfred Hill’s daughter
Isolda offered a cluster of new songs, and
Cyril Monk’s fiddle sang with its usual
sweetness and intelligence. The great inter-
est of the evening centred in Arthur Benja-
min’s playing of his Sonata in F Minor.
Flapperdom, remembering the artist’s suav-
ity allied to his fine car, would have voted
Pachmann a poor second in comparison. He
is soon off to London to see about publishing
an opera or a fairy play for which Hugh
McCrae has supplied the libretto.
There was a packed Playhouse on Satur-
day night to greet Mrs. Dale’s "Secondary
Considerations,” and when the Repertory
Society had worked the genuinely good third
act up to a stirring curtain C.ere was real
enthusiasm among the first-nighters. Eleanor
Ross and Beatrice Macdonald were the suc-
cesses of the evening until the final curtain,
when the author held the stage. Dressed
in black taffeta that had long clusters of
golden fruit and flowers worked upon it, Mrs.
Dale took the call and made a neat little
speech through a thick barrage of floral
offerings, while numerous small offspring sat
in the front rows with daddy and swelled
with pride. Flowers and compliments and
anplause for everybody concerned left the
little box of a theatre quivering.
The Philharmonics got in first with “The
Messiah” last Saturday, and the Hallelujah
Chorus drew its usual muster from the
highways and byways to fill the caverns of the
Town Hall. Among the soloists, making a
first appearance in the Christmas draw, was
dainty soprano Marie Nilsson, from Maori-
land. Myrtle Thorne was responsible for
the contralto numbers, Robert Harper sup-
plied the tenor and Oliver King the bass
solos.
Pretty Rosa Alba will be one of the big
draws of the Sydney Society’s “Messiah”
next Saturday. Contralto Marion Kemp
and tenor James A. Gibb will be strong sup-
ports, while conductor Reginald Gooud will
double his job, and thunder and rumble on
the bass.
The charity stir of the week was the
Cafe Chantant engineered by Hilda Caro
and Mrs. Lyster Ormsbj on behalf of the
foodless kiddies of Europe. At 3 o’clock
there was an early-door rush on the new
Moekbell cafe, where best dresses and white
gloves engaged in a genteel scramble for
front seats, and later on wished they hadn’t,
for as the afternoon wore on large layers
of Sydney wedged themselves into the audi-
ence, and the heat in the big basement rose
steadily to vapor-bath point. When you got
tired of watching the international pro-
gramme or absorbing the coffee, yoq pushed
or squirmed through the crowd according to
your character and bought flowers and
sweets and face preparations from “barrows”
against the walls. The flowers, in spite of
the heat, were gorgeous; roses in piled-up
sweetness and snapdragon in delicat§ tones
caught any breath of freshness that might
push its way down the stairs, where Mrs.
Domerschikoff in black lace dress and hat
kept the bridge with “Tickets, please!”
Hilda Caro revolved around the rooms as
ceaselessly as though she were tied to a
wheel, and dressed the part of porridge-pro-
vider for Europe in floral taffetas and a
leaf-brown hat; Mrs. Ormsby was all black
except for a string of exquisite amber; and
Mrs. Frank White peddled the French per-
fumes. All through the evening there was
jazz for the grown-ups, with frolics by some
pretty and clever children in plump white
muslin skirts.
Mr s. McElhone.
the new Mayoress of
Sydney, was edu-
cated at St. Vin-
cent’s Convent, and
her big heart leads
her on to every phil-
anthropic committee
i n Sydney. But
th e happiness o f
little children is her
absorbing passion,
and she is a member
of the Day Nursery
Association and of
the Committee for
the Barnardo Boys’
Home.
The Cavalier swung
into a sea of motion,
rhythmic and otherwise, on Saturday night,
when it made its first bid for the Cinderellas
of Sydney and their Princes. To placate
some" by-law or other the carpet was kept
on the floor, so anybody joining in had the
appearance of doing it b v accident rather
than design. The scene was somehow remi-
niscent of “Milestones.” Champagne flowed
in beakers, youth mingled with near-youth,
the management supplied vanity cases and
fans', and among a long list of hosts and
hostesses knight Owen Cox, Mrs. Sep Levy
and the Maitlands entertained outsize
gatherings.
The trial for the Professional Diploma at
the Conservatorium last week introduced
three talented youngsters to Sydney audi-
ences. Myrtle Meggy’s pupil Ada Brook
flashed through the Grieg Concerto in con-
junction with the orchestra in a way that
drew cannonades of applause upon her. No
less stirring was violinist Nora William-
son’s Max Bruch Concerto, while mezzo-
soprano Ha Turnbull’s debut added another
to Sydney’s successful concert artists.
St. Quintin Downer’s recital in the King’s
Hall was one of the features of a week that
was music-steeped. Probably a ballot would
have resulwi in the Beethoven Sonata top-
ping the poll, with the Chopin numbers a
close second. There is no “inverse ratio” or
“seventh sense” or pskcho-analytic ingredi-
ent in the St. Quintin Downer music—it is
just music, which invites you to sit back
and enjoy it.
The Chapter House of St. Andrew’s was
very gay when the Harbor Lights Guild held
the first of its invitation concerts. The
Deloitte girls, Mrs. Alexander Gordon and
Dudley Helmrich were strong supports on
a programme that was all good ; and organ-
ising secretary Mrs. Arthur Scrivener can
add another to the list of her successful en-
tertainments.
“Billy” McElhone, Sydney’s new Mayor,
is an old St. Aloysius’s College boy, and is
the son of John, of
the Sharp-edged
Tongue, who repre-
sented the Upper
Hunter in the N. S.
Parliament as far
back as 1875, and
was kept busy mak-
ing speeches either
for his first consti-
tuency, East Sydney,
or Fitzroy (Syd-
ney) until 1895.
When not selling
law, old John’s son
is gardening or fish-
ing, or attending to
his duties as presi-
dent of the Cricket
Association. Work
that endeared him
to many of his Sydney neighbors he did as
joint-controller with Danger Owen, of the
Red Cross Information Bureau —for over
four years he gave up his own job to attend
to the rain of inquiries concerning dead,
wounded and missing among our soldiers.
Even the Rock of St. Peter moves a little
with the times, so the Vatican is allowing
the Choir of the Sistine Chapel to go sing-
ing half across the world. Monsignor Relta
will conduct the 65 voices, and Thomas
Quinlan and E. J. and Dan Carroll will
direct it. Though the choir was founded in
the Fourth Century, this is the first time it
has left Italy for touring purposes.
The grounds of Belvidere, in Woolcott-
street, are being lent by Mrs. Pic-kburn to
provide the setting for a pastoral play by
the girls of Frencham school, who are put-
ting on “Twelfth Night” in aid of St. Luke’s.
Beatrice Kelly is in the cast; and every-
body is suddenly remembering mother’s fine
acting in other days.
On Saturday next Omar Khayyam will
brood over his Persian Garden to the musi-
cal accompaniment of Liza Lehmann. Bessie
Blake, Charles Smythe, Phyllis Hazel and
Ernest Archer are the mouthpieces of the
Immortal’s unorthodox philosophy, and
King’s Hall the jumping-off place into the
vine-wreathed garden.
St. James’s Church was crowded last
week to hear the fair Vera Forster say “I
will” to Captain Harold Vale, one of the
Australian engineering Vales, but an officer
in the English forces during the war. The
bride dabbled in war-work herself, and was
one of the first to toil at Repatriation in
Sydney. For a long time she assisted the
Publicity officers of that department. Vera,
who has a light foot in the jazz and a
pretty style of frocking, did the big deal in
white satin draped over chantilly Dee. inter-
sected with silver roses, and wore a string
of pearls which, with diamond-initial wrist-
lets to the four bridesmaids, must have con-
siderably lightened the bridegroom’s lopse-
change pocket.
The Felix Booths have announced the en-
gagement of eldest daughter Vera to Emile
Higinbotham, only son of that charming and
accomplished Frenchwoman who has done
so much to bring about the entente cordiale
in these parts.
Topsy Marks, of Neutral Bay, crossed
over to St. Clement’s, at Mosman, on Satur-
day night, and left it Mrs. Rupert Donald-
son. The tiny bride looked like an ivory
cameo in her creamy satin and Limerick
lace drapings. Two nieces, Mary Marks
and Sheila McDonald, and cousin Nancy
Bourn were bridesmaids.
Dunedin (M.L.) is giving its Glengarry
an extra bit of a tilt, because it is linking
up with the real home-brewed gentry. God-
frey Holdsworth, of the Union Steamship
family, has offered and had accepted the dia-
mond seal of bethrothal, and the lady is
Andrina Weir, daughter of Lord Inverforth,
the gentleman who used to be head of the
shipowning firm of Andrew Weir & Co., of
London, Glasgie and other ports.
Winifred Jenner, who has been in Geneva
getting extra polish on her voice from Louis
de la Cruz, who was a soloist for the Con-
cert Society of the Conservatorium in Paris
for a number of years, and still sings there
when he gets a spell from lesson- and lecture-
giving, returns to Sydney in January.
Sydney ’Varsity recently conferred the
title of Professor Emeritus on “Tommy”
Butler, who for 40 years taught Latin there.
A kindly and sympathetic man, he was be-
loved by his students, who are genu-
inely grieved that ill-health and other causes
have made his present days rather difficult.
As his teaching life is over a strong com-
mittee is launching a movement to help him
in a practical way.
A heavy shower of congratulations has
fallen on Professor Holme on his appoint-
ment as Dean of the Faculty of Arts, which
makes him also a member of the Senate.
Not only has he been winning the affection
of the undergrads, ever since his own stu-
dent days, but his tour of Europe and the
U.S.A:, and his exhaustive inquiries into
American University management, ought to
make him a valuable addition to the govern-
ing body of his old school.
People who deal in bottled lightning are
wondering what is behind the visit of L.
Nicholls, chief statistician to the New York
General Electric, the biggest co. of its kind
in the world. He is spending most of his
time with one of the heads of the Australian
Electrical Co. Nicholls is an out-of-the-
ordinary looking man, and makes a hobby of
things like psychology and mental telepathy.
He served on the other side with the Dough-
boys, and got badly gassed.
There never was another Australian artist
who put a horse on canvas quite like Frank
Mahony, and there never was another Aus-
tralian artist who did himself less justice.
In the end —he died in 1916—he was being
buried from an English hospital as a friend-
less pauper, when Fred Leist happened to
hear of it, and at once whipped up half-a-
dozen friends of the Chelsea Art Club to do
things differently. So Mahony was buried
in Kensington Cemetery, Ilanwell, and now
a small committee, consisting of Leist, Will
Dyson and two or three others, is sending
round the hat to put a slab over the grave
of this pioneer artist of the Australian bush.
There are sure to be some old admirers who
would like to drop a trifle into this fund;
and at the request of the committee William
Macleod, of The Bulletin Office, will pass
on anything that may be sent to him.
Leist, by the way, has just had a picture
purchased by the Sheffield Gallery—one
that was exhibited at the Royal Academy
last year.
Dr. Eric Pockley is returning to Sydney
after nine months’ strenuous holiday in
Papua. Among his achievements is that of
scrambling to a higher point on Mt. Obree
than any other explorer had reached, a feat
which he had to ‘accomplish alone, as no
native will face the top on account of the
ghosts that camp up there. Dr. Pockley has
a facile pen, and the literature of New
Guinea should get a fillip from' his well-
balanced observations.
The Duke of York is being mentioned as
the first Governor of the Irish Free State.
Sydney Telegraph hastened to disturb the
peace by presenting his portrait in kilts.
Why Ireland should be governed in kilts
passes comprehension. A long saffron robe,
not a skimpy petticoat, was the old Irish
outfit.
Sydney has a new monthly, Society,
whose pages are filled with well-reproduced
photographs on paper of the finest quality.
For the rest it recounts the doings of
the upper and in some instances (alas for
its high title!) the lower orders. It is owned
by a son of Talbot Smith, of Adelaide, who is
putting into it some of the money left him
by his grand-dad, E. T. Smith, knight, phil-
anthropist and good citizen.
A Brisbane postscript:—
At Central Queensland paper was responsible for
this: —■
Perth, IS/11/’2l. —Dr. Le Fanu, who is theat-
rically known as Nora Delaney and who arrived
at Fremantle on board the steamer Osterley, will
appear in “The Babes in the 'Wood” pantomime under
Williamson management at Christmas. She expects
to be in Australia six or seven months.
Canon Battye read the par. at a welcome home
to the rosy-cheeked bishop, and added sadly, “I
have always urged that the clergy should be paid
a living wage for their clerical services.”
Sister Keys, who owns the R.R.C. and an M.M.,
in addition to the affection of a large mob of Dig-
gers, is to be married soon. Her mamma gave an
at-home at Rowe’s cafe for her. Army nupses
flocked to it, for Sister Keys is as popular with her
own kind as she is admired by the other.
The thermometer almost bubbled; but the heat
did not keep anyone away from Ascot for Gover-
nor’s Cup Day. His Ex. was there, of course,
chaperoned by Captain Harry Hammond. Organdi,
voile a,nd georgette were the three winners in the
frocking stakes.
May, daughter of Mrs. Edwin Lilley, is to marry
John Cook, of Melbourne, on Monday week. Eric
Bedford, son of Randolph, is engaged to Molly Jamie-
son, a grand-daughter of Maj.-Gen. John Cruise. By
the way, Randolph, M.L.C., left for America last
week ; but he blessed the pair before he went. And
Ealla Irvine, a pretty Brisbane girl who now lives
in Sydney, is to be married on Dec. 20 to Victor
Hulbert, a Potts Pointer.

Janus: No new thought in it, and thought
ia the only key to unlock the door to that page....
M. Wells (hon. sec. W.P.I.C.): Glad to hear the
Women’s Prohibition Investigation Council isn’t a
prohibition agency, and that “all we are doing is
asking our women friends across the Pacific what they
think of it.” No doubt it was in order to keep the
Council absolutely impartial that it took the room
next to the one occupied by the chief organiser of the
N. Alliance at Macdonell House, where also
Grit, the Prohibition paper, is printed.... Capel B.:
Too horrible.... Boozhard N.: You ought to be able
to do something acceptable Iv.uaka: Tuneful; but
the tune doesn’t suggest the tui Dinkum D.:
1 hanks. Here s luck.... Echap : Hardly a yarn in
it; but there’s material for a good Abo.‘ par there.
E.C.: “Reverie” is done well enough; but half
the verse that is being written now seems to be that
dreamy stuff. .. .V.L.: Sorry, space isn’t available,. . . .
J.C. (Wentworth): Terrifying verse Slim T.: Not
up. . . . J.A.T.: Sheer commonplace. .. .S.G.H.: Doesn’t
get out of the ruck. .. .C.S'.M.: Can’t understand a
“woman-hater of the first water.” A woman-hater of
the last beer is a possibility W.H.H.: You haven’t
written the yarn that the materials will make
E.D. (Randwick) : Both miss... .H.J.W.: Bad verse
without much interest H.B.W..: The awful
weight of commonplace which descended on you while
drunk throws dark suspicion on the brand. Could
it have been milk-shake ?.... L.N.C.: The verse can’t
carry it. .. .A.G.W.: Doesn’t say enough. .. .A.C.-M.:
Nice little song of its sort, but too slight A.R.T.:
That theme has been worked too often in nearly the
same way. .. .G.T.D.: Not well enough done. . . . Pros-
pero: Your friends understated the case when they
called it “dramatic” :—
Hark to the bells! “Ting-a-ling-a-ling!”
’Tis a wedding morn, hear the people sing!
There goes the bridegroom, here comes the bride;
Up jumps the jilted one—bang! bang ! he fired.
Out to the open all the people'fled;
No more the bells ring, bride and bridegroom dead.
....Basil L.: Commonplace. .. .Are F.: You haven’t
made a yarn of it Cecil M.: The “River” gets
lost among the willows. .. .L.A.R.R.: They don’t get
near the goal... .Cambronne: Can’t find the humor.
... .Trevor V.: Too thin... .James: Poor stuff. ...
Joan R.: Get a live subject and you will probably
do something worth while with .it. .. .E.R.D.: Ancient
ideas hacked out with a saw. .. .R.D.F.: Worth send-
ing to the girl.... Edwin B.: “The Pit” begins well,
but tails off to a poor ending. Try again... .Horace
II.: The humor wants some fattening food..'. .H.L.H.:
Not strong enough... .J.P.M.: One pair of rhymes
to eight lines is short weight. .. .Harry P.: Moral
tale of the false lover who Was instantly drowned for
leaving the girl is too giddy to suit our theological
views... .H.W. (Brisbane): Not uf>.... Richard A.:
Not for us.... James: Be as “firm and strong”
as you like, but the verse must be better
written.... H.H.N.: Don’t be an imitator; it
isn’t worth while... .P.G.: (St. Hilda): Too
slight.... Graeme: Not enough in “Irony”
L.R.F.: Two have a chance. .. .Saladin, jun.: Watch
your rhymes. ' The first stanza spoiled “Friday”....
J.A.G.: It doesn’t suit. .. .W.J! (Watson’s Bay) :
>“Psyched” has no distinction... .R.C.M. (Ryde) : You
have a fair idea of verse; now find something to say.
. .. .F.T. (Sydney) : “Pieball” has humor, but the
verse is awful. .. .W.G. (Auckland): “Indigestion”
not well enough done. . . .V.K.T.: It misses, but not
by much. Avoid using meaningless phrases. .. .E.H.G.:
Wanted better telling S.O.B.: “Eye” verse far too
rugged... .Charles L.: No use. .. .Tom Mot: That
yarn, with minor variations, has been current ever
since the worst reciter mounted a platform Eli D.:
Doesn’t get near U.M.C.: Very rough sort of
“Witchery” K.B.J.: No use starting with another
man’s rhymes to make an imitation of well-known
verse J.M.C.: Terrible parodies of verse and sense.
A.R.J.: Nothing to get excited about in the
statement .that you can’t play cards very well. If
it comes to that, you can’t spell very well either
Nellie W.: Very bad. Read good verse and root out
your faults Ethel T.: Horrible . .. .Questa: Too
extravagantly told. .. .R.C.B.: Nothing in the long-
drawn-out “Peace Tragedy.” Alison D.: The
spider was an ink-spot and the boy was scornful--
that’s the whole yarn... .I.L.I: “Scandalous’ doesn <.
hold the interest Poppy: Not well enough done..
C J W.: Verse doesn’t get near. Haven’t met the
“Tuner” Slim Tim: It moves like a furniture van.
Guill: Don’t care for “Plague” E.H. (Hawks-
bum): “The Flies” won’t do T.W.G.D.: “Beaches”
and “creatures” refuse to rhyme in this paper....
M.F. (Stanmore) : The remarks of the bishop and
vicar haven’t point enough... .Charles T,: Wooden
verse Kat: The Ode to “Civilisation” is like no
other poem in the language. For example:
I’m truth. I know I’m sly ;
■ But civilisation is not telling a lie.
When my head is lifted it’s downed. Why
I suppose I’ll know by and bye.
. .E.R.S.: Weak verse, weakened further by moral
tags... .G.E.R.: Vigorous, but wants a bit of sand-
papering. .. .L.M.R.: Two lines : —
Learn to laugh in this realm of strife
And spit on its gods of plaster.
F.G. (Darlinghurst) : “Pearl Bay” is too ramb-
ling Carl: Tedious H.C.K.: Not for us
Jemil: Even as a first attempt it’s pretty bad.
X.Y.Z.: Don’t do it again Margaret Q.:
Both fell L.H. (Bellambi) : Off The Bulletin’s
track. .. .X.O.C.: Compress them more Bones: A
bit too raw John-Oh: Both miss, but try again.
G.W.L.: Variation of old yarn. .. .B.B.: But
there’s still a place called Australia o.i the map....
K.M.0.: The Abo. Council settled that last year.
.. . . J.C.McD.: Thanks. But we wouldn’t have the
enormous congregation to address if we only preached.
. .. .S.E.: Nothing in “Films” that hasn’t been said,
and said, and said again... .L.N.C.: There isn t the
music in “Cello” that there ought to be.... J.T.H.P..
Not quite well enough done. But you might con-
dense it to a very acceptable Abo. par.... H.B.:
The picture in “Summer” is good ; but the song is
hard to catch.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.O.B.: That joke’s older than you ever will be.
C.W.: Not the right touch yet....M.J.: Not
up S.U.: Much too niggly; develop a broader
style J.B.: Sorry, but not much promise there
C.G.M.: Not suitable for illustration J.W.T.:
Ancient L.H.: Yes, but you haven’t C.A.C.:
Bad drawing V.L.H.: Idea makes no appeal....
R.J.W.: Drawing shows some promise, but the idea
is weak I.C.: Both have the marks of the Flood
upon them... .S.H.: Below par... .A.C.L.: Ditto.
. .. .V.D.: Wooden drawings.

“VALET”
Safety" Razor
It is easy to shave as closely and cleanly as a barber if
you have a “barber’s edge” on your razor blade. Years
of practice have taught him how to strop his razor to
the highest pitch of keenness. With the “ Valet ” Auto-
Strop you can obtain such an edge every morning,
without serving an apprenticeship.
Built right into the razor is a self-stropping device which
puts the keenest edge on the blade. Half-a-dozen
strokes on its strop is all that is needed. Nothing to
unscrew—no separate stropping machine —no constant
expense for new blades.
And the “Valet” Auto Strop is as easy to clean as to
strop —just a rinse and a wipe, without taking to pieces.
THE STANDARD SET (as illus.
trated) consists of heavily silver-plated,
self - stropping “Valet” Auto Strop
Safety Razor, twelve “Valet” blades,
and “ Valet ” strop, complete

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT would not do for them to know,
They would cry “Useless and unwise !”
So I must leave the house tiptoe,
Black-gowned and veiled from prying eyes ;
Must hold the latch, lest it should click,
Must very softly close the gate;
With subtle steps must tread, heart-sick,
Lest I should fail you where you wait.
And I must sidle down the street,
And creep from door to door, to find
A place where lilies smell too sweet
Beyond a lightly flapping blind;
A window with a tinsel wreath
And photographs of funeral trains,
A long black cart that stands beneath
A black-frocked man who holds the reins.
A woman meets me at the door,
And she is gowned in black as well;
With muffled foot she walks the floor
(It helps to make her coffins sell!) ;
Manner respectful and subdued,
With details of the toilette made
Upon you—all is snowy-hued,
And by you many flowers are laid.
Why are they such unbroken white?
I should have liked a splendid red,
A yellow . blossom like a light,
A great pink rose to cheer your bed.
And, as she talks, her folded hands
Are like a corpse’s hands, her voice
Is as a requiem where she stands
And tells me she approves my choice—
This polished wood, this silver plate,
This fine engraving. O’er your head
The coffin lid leans grim as Pate....
Oh, go and leave me ■with my dead!
The curtain falls. She feels she fails,
Yet, civil, does as she is bid.
Outside they drive the level nails
Into some other coffin lid.
Tick, tack—how fast they beat them there!
Yet fast enbugh clings misery....
And you—you do not seem to care,
But just lie still and smile at me!
Yet once, if aught had made me cry,
How you would fling your arm out,
Bidding the world to pass me by,
To lap me with your love about!
And now that world might murder me,
Might torture and condemn at will.
And you would neither hear nor see,
But go on smiling, lying still.
Your lashes are so thick, they lie
Where your lined cheek yet holds its tan.
And cold and pale are those who die —
But you were such a vigorous man!
Your great chest rises—breathing, dear?
Your hand that worked so hard lies slack.
If I should whisper in your ear
Just three short words, would you come
back ?
You cannot be so far away.
The earth is made of many miles,
You only left me yesterday. ,
(The hammer fa 115.... and still he
smiles !.)
Our silky oaks are blooming now,
And soon the jacaranda trees
l r ou loved, along the garden’s brow,
Will blossom into witcheries.
We might find some old garden seat
We found long since, to dream and read,
And pause for argument—how sweet
Old memories are. And yet they bleed!
Your name upon the lid? ’Tis strange.
I have seen other hdarses pass;
I have seen seasons wax and change
And turn brown soil to emerald grass—-
But not your name upon a stone,
Your name that is my name ! And yet
You passed and left me here alone.
And though my cheek on yours is wet
You do not move. I came so far*
By crowded street, by devious ways,
To find this corner where you are ;
And now you do not even praise
My courage, and my cunning too,
That made me trick them all, to find
You waiting at a rendezvous
With eyes as gratified- and kind
As when you waited long ago
At some street section near the Quay,
Frowning because your watch seemed slow
Always w*hen you expected me.
They say your carriage waits for you.
Then let your carriage empty go.
That you are dead. . . .it is not true!
Just give me time, and I will show....
Doctors and undertakers bring !
That you still live the craft shall prove.
Mine is the hand that bears your ring....
And yet, somehow, you do not move !
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Snorky and the Squatter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
T'l HE train from Geelong and the West-
ern District beyond was over 10
minutes late. Propped comfortably
between a couple of large cases standing
against the wall of the principal luggage-
room, Snorky Jenson eyed the throng that
waited, more or less impatiently, for the
friends they expected. The approach of a
couple of big, hefty-looking men galvanised
Snorky into action. He straightened him-
self suddenly and made as though to vacate
his position; then with a defiant glint in
his eyes, he thrust out his rabbit-like chin
at an almost truculent angle. The two large
men stopped in front of Snorky, and for a
moment or two eyed him intently.
“Well, me noble Knight of the Three
Stars,” remarked the larger of the two, “and
what may your illustrious presence here
mean, eh?”
“An’ ain’t I gutter right t’ be here ? s well
as anyone else?” asked Snorky with an out-
ward assumption of bravado, but with an
inward feeling of concern. “Yer ain’t got
anythin’ agen me. Y’ can’t vag me: I’ve
bin workin', see here,” and he rooted in his
trousers pockets and pulled out a couple of
notes and a handful of silver.
Detectives Bantry and Collings eyed the
wealth with a doubt in their eyes.
“Humph!” remarked Bantry at. last; “I
suppose it’s all right. But what are you
hanging around here for, anyway?”
“Waitin’ fer someone cornin’ on th’ Gee-
long train,” replied Snorky.
“Oh! Squatter from the Western Dis-
trict, I suppose?” remarked Collings, jeer-
ingly.
To the surprise of the two detectives,
Snorky burst into the nearest ap-
proach to real laugh’ter he was capable of.
“Y’ _ guessed it in one, Mr. Collings,” he
replied; and then with a certain amount
of assurance that convinced the detectives
he was telling the truth—for they knew
Snorky—he added: “Just t’ show yer,” and
pulled out a crumpled piece of paper from
his pocket, and handed it to Bantry.
The detective flattened out the creases on
his knee and perused what was written on
the paper. It wasn’t much. “Dear Jepson,”
was what he read aloud, “I am coming to
Melbourne on Tuesday”—“that’s t’-day,”
Snorky chipped in—“and I shall be
pleased to see you. I have a lot of business
to attend to ; but I can spare time for the
man who saved my son from drowning some
years ago.” The letter was signed with a
scrawling signature, “John Brownson.”
Bantry handed the letter back to Snorky
with honest appreciation in his eyes. “Well,
I’ll be damned!” he remarked. “I never
thought you had it in you, Snorky.” Then,
his professional instincts coming to the fore,
“I suppose it was an accident, anyway?”
“Gam, earn’t yer give a bloke a charnce?”
whimpered Snorky. “Alwus down on a
cove. I ain’t always been th’ same.”
“Where’s Joe?” remarked Collings sud-
denly. “We haven’t seen him about for the
last few days.”
Snorky looked at his interrogator with
pained surprise. “I thought yer’d know,
bein’ D’s, pore Joe’s been down on his back
with the rheumatiz for over a week,” he
said.
A rumbling began to make itself heard,
gradually becoming nearer and louder.
“Well, I think this is the train you’re
waiting for, Snorky,” remarked Bantry, as
he turned away; “and,” he added with a
chuckle, “don’t lead Mr. Brownson into evil
ways.”
“Garn,” wailed Snorky. “Carn’t y’ give
a bloke a charnce?”
Standing at the far end of the platform
the detectives saw Snorky rush up to a
large, brown-faced, whiskered man, who
emerged from a first-class carriage. There
was no question of the squatter’s cordiality
in greeting the little rabbit-faced town bum-
mer. fie pumped his hand as though he
would shake the arm from Snorky’s shoulder
the while he talked to him. Then giving
Snorky a regular good-fellow pat on the
back he picked up his own handbag, and
with Snorky shuffling behind him walked
away from the station.
“Well, I’ll be jiggered!” exclaimed Ban-
try. “Damn me if that little rat Snorky
hasn’t got one on us!”
Mr. Brownson, with great strides, crossed
Spencer-street with Snorky a few feet be-
hind him. In front of the hotel on the oppo-
site side of the street he pulled up, and
motioning to Snorky led the way into the
private entrance of the hotel.
“A couple of whiskies,” Mr. Brownson
ordered in a loud voice; then in answer
to a mumbled protest from Snorky he added
just as loudly, “Oh, go on, Jepson, you’re
not going to drink anything as cheap as
beer with me. Eh? What? I mustn’t
shout out so loud? Damn it all, man, what’s
wrong with it?”
“Nothin’, sir, nothin’,” replied Snorky
abashed; “on’y it sounds loud down here.”
“Oh, well, I suppose you’re right, Jep-
son,” replied the squatter; “but a fellow
can’t help being what he is, can he? I’ve
got to beller pretty loud sometimes to make
some of my hands know I’m about. And
the habit’s sort of grown on me.”
“I s’pose so, sir,” responded Snorky, as
he shoved his glass across for the second
instalment of refreshment that Mr. Brown-
son ordered.
Sipping leisurely at this, Snorky’s eyes
roved casually around the room and fell on
a hatchet-faced and fashionably-dressed
young man seated at a table in one corner
of the room. Letting his vagrant eye wan-
der a couple of feet further, he found it
resting on another young, well-dressed man
seated opposite the first. Both were appa-
rently concerned mostly with the consump-
tion of the contents of very small glasses
of liquor; but Snorky, as his glance roved
in their direction, caught an unmistakable
and meaning wink shot at him from the
first one his eyes had lighted on. Then Mr.
Brownson’s loud voice boomed again.
“Just another one, Jepson, and I must
be off.”
“Yes, sir,” replied Snorky respectfully.
“What are you down for, Mr. Brownson?
Stud rams?”
“Stud rams, be damned!” Mr. Brownson
thundered with vehemence. “I’ve got th’
best stud rams in Victoria. No, I’m after
a horse that can race. I want to win the
Squatters’ Cup at the Jing Jing meeting this
year, and at present I haven’t got anything
on my place that can do it.”
He grabbed up his bag and remarked:
“Well, I must be off. I’ll see you to-mor-
row, Jepson, where we arranged. S’long!”
Snorky made as though to follow him;
but he stopped as a sharp hiss from the
corner caught his ears, and he turned and
faced the author of the sound. The hatcliet-
faced young man at the table in the corner
beckoned to Snorky, and Snorky in the
manner of a mouse fascinated by a snake
slithered across the floor to him.
“Who’s the big bloke with the ziff?” the
hatchet-faced young man asked.
Snorky, still under a kind of hypnotic
influence, replied sulkily, “Just a friend of
mine from th’ bush. A squatter I worked
for once. Anyway, what’s it gotter do with
you?”

"Every Picture
Tells a Story"
Are you dull, tired, achy all over—bothered with a “bad
back” ? Do you lack energy for the day’s work? Evening
find you “all played out’’? Don’t worry so much about
it! You can’t expect to feel up to par if your kidneys are
not acting right. The kidneys need help occasionally,
just as the bowels need help. A dull, nagging backache;
soreness, lameness and sharp, sudden pains are all
symptoms of neglected kidneys. You may have head-
aches and dizziness, too, and perhaps some annoying
kidney irregularity. Don’t wait for more serious
troubles. Get back your health and keep it! Use Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. They have helped thousands and should help you. Ask your neighbor I
SYDNEY PEOPLE CURED.
A WATERLOO RESIDENT.
Mrs. W. Sullivan, 2 Brisbane Street, Waterloo, Sydney, says:—“l suffered
terribly with my kidneys for some time. I had terrible pains in my back, and could
hardly move without suffering torture. Every time I stooped I would get a twinge
across my kidneys like the stab of a knife, and I coirld not help screaming out. I
was also subject to bad headaches, dizzy feelings, and had urinary trouble, the
secretions being thick and cloudy, and difficult to pass. Nothing I took Seemed to
suit my case, and I suffered on in spite of treatment, but at last I got a good remedy
and that was Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. A friend advised me to take a
course of these pills, which I did, and I am pleased to say they cured me of every
distressing symptom mentioned above. I used ten bottles in all, and my cure is
perfect, for I have been as right as rain for the last twelve months.”
Six years later Mrs. Sullivan says:—“Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured me
of backache and kidney trouble seven years ago, and I am still well, but I always
keep this remedy by me and take a dose or so now and then, just as a help to the
' kidneys.”.
A NORTH SYDNEY RESIDENT.
Mr. H. Holder, Euronga, Amhurst Street, North Sydney, says-“Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills are indeed a wonderful kidney medicine. I have proved this.
For a long time I suffered agony from backache and kidney trouble, and only those
who have been afflicted in this way have any idea what I went through. My limbs
swelled considerably, the kidney secretions were thick and cloudy, with a red sedi-
ment, and I had agonising pains in my back. When I stooped it was as much as
I could do to stand up straight again without assistance, my back was so stiff
and lame. I was treated by a doctor, and tried all sorts of remedies, but nothing
gave me the slightest relief. I was naturally very worried about the serious state
of my health, and when Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were brought under my
notice I decided to try them. It was a grand thing for me that I got this remedy,
for seven bottles cured me completely. I cannot speak too highly of Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and recommend them with every confidence to other
sufferers.”
Four years later Mr. Holder says: “I have still the same good opinion of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured me of kidney disorder four years ago,
and I have had no return of the complaint since.”

“Don’t get your hair off, Snorky,” re-
plied the other; then to his companion, “Get
us three whiskies, Boh.”
Snorky eyed him suspiciously. “What’s
th’ game*'I'’ 1 '’ lie asked. “Y’ don’t worry
much erbout me when y’see me in th’ street,
Jumbo. Yer up ter something.”
Mr. Jumbo Lawson, spieler and confi-
dence man, laughed easily. “And why
should I?” he asked. “But it’s business this
time. Look ! That old pot who’s just gone
out —he’s pretty well in, isn’t he?”
“Worth thousands,” answered Snorky.
“Owns a station in th’ Weste’n Districk.”
“So I gathered. Bight, Bob,” as his com-
panion returned with the drinks. "Lap it
up, Snorky.” Then leaning across the table
he fixed his keen hawk-like eyes squarely
on Snorky’s face. “What’ll you take to.
give us an introduction to your friend?” he
asked. “A fiver?”
; Snorky’s eyes brightened at the mention
ot the money, but he shook his head.
“You won’t, you dirty sewer rat,” the
crook snapped. “Well, say six quid. No?” —
as Snorky again shook his head —“then damn
you, you loafing blank, I’ll make it seven,”
Snorky grabbed up his whisky and, swal-
lowing it at a gulp, rose. Jumbo, real con-
cern in his eyes, also rose and laid a detain-
ing hand on the other’s shoulder. “Sit down
and have another whisky, Snorky,” he said
wheedingly. “I’m sorry I called vou what
I did.”
Snorky obediently resumed his seat, while
Bob hurried across to the bar for another
supply of refreshment. Returning, he
"placed a glass nearly full of neat whisky
before Snorky. Jumbo nodded his head
approvingly, and then turned his attention
to the business in hand.
“What’ll you take, Snorky?” he asked
quietly.
Snorky took a sip—a long sip—at his
whisky, and appeared to be considering.
Then placing his glass down on the table,
he replied deliberately, “A tenner down.”
i“A tenner!” ejaculated Jumbo. “Why,
you”
“Yes, a tenner,” reaffirmed Snorky, “an’
not a penny less. An’ I want it now, too.
None of yer sniart tricks with me or I’ll
put ole Browmson fly t’ yer game.”
Jumbo swore under his breath; then,
placing his hand in his breast pocket, he
pulled out a roll of notes and counted 10
singles into Snorky’s trembling paw. Snorky
rose and stowed the wealth carefully in the
recesses of his tattered garments.
“Meet me at th’ Pos’ Office t’morrer at
one an’ I’ll give yer an intro, t’ him. I
dunno what yer game is, Jumbo; s’pose
yer mean t’ rook him; but that’s his look-
out.”
He slouched out of the room, and Jumbo
turned to Bob with a glare in his eyes.
“The Judas !” he exploded. “A tenner!”
Punctually at one o’clock the next after-
noon Mr. Jumbo Lawson reached the G.P.0.,
and looked around for Snorky and the
squatter. His confederate. Mr. Bob Ar-
mour, was not in evidence. For five minutes
or so Jumbo fidgeted about on the steps.
He knew that even a comparatively short
sojourn at that great rendezvous of country
folk would attract the unweicome attention
of the D.’s, who would unquestionably want
to Know the reason for ins presence there.
After 10 minutes’ waiting dumbo became
a trifle concerned and apprehensive. Had
that rat Snorky "blown the gaff”? But he
reassured himself with the comforting know-
ledge that Snorky, the rabbit-faced, chicken-
hearted town bummer, was more frightened
of the detective force than lie was. Still,
he cursed Snorky hard and heartily, and in
the middle of his condemnations saw
Snorky and his squatter friend emerge from
a hotel. He steadied as he got nearer to
them ; then, apparently noticing the pair for
the first time, he paused, and exclaimed, as
though pleased at the prospect of meeting
Snorky—which in truth he was —“Ah, good
afternoon, Snor—Jepson ! How are you?”
Snorky, eyeing him narrowly, mumbled
that he was all right, and then “niterdooced”
him to the squatter, Jumbo at once pro-
ceeded to make himself agreeable, as he
knew well how to do, and to his secret de-
light noticed that the squatter seemed quite
taken with him. At Jumbo’s suggestion
they adjourned to a hotel, and o>ver their
whiskies Jumbo talked incessantly, common-
places mostly. Then Mr. Brownson, as
his fourth whisky began to make its presence
felt, began to talk, too, and talked loud and
earnestly, and amongst other things told the
affable Mr. Lawson the principal reason for
his visit to Melbourne.
“Well, now, if that isn’t remarkable!”
exclaimed Jumbo Lawson, when Mr. Brown-
son had finished.
"What is?” asked the squatter.
“You wanting a racehorse.” answered Mr.
Lawson—“it’s really remarkable. Why, I
have a friend, a Mr. Armour, who has at
this moment a horse, of good breeding and
splendid performances, which he is willing
to sell. How much did you intend to pay,
Mr. Brownson?”
“Oh, not too much,” answered the squat-
ter, airily. “Say a couple of hundred. At
first I intended getting something classy, but
I ought to get a good enough bag for my pur-
pose for a couple of hundred.”
Jumbo had to turn his head away so that
Brownson would not see the light of satis-
faction that came into his eyes at the men-
tion of the £2OO. and they encountered the
fascinated gaze of Mr. Jepson. In truth,
Snorky was astounded at the easy confidence
of the spieler; he was satisfied that Mr.
Brownson would find himself “trimmed” to
the extent of at least £2OO before he left
town. And, at that moment, the man from the
Western District looked “easy”—he seemed
to be “three sheets in the wind.” For all that,
Snorky gave a sudden start of surprise when
Mr. Brownson, turning suddenly to him, said
thickly, as he held out his hand, “Well, good-
bye, Jepson. Mr. Lawson and I are going
no to jiave a look at Ids friend’s horse
Course, I dunno whether I’ll buy it; but if
it’s as good as he says it is, I expect I will.
I’m off back home to-morrow, so I’ll sav
good-bye,” and he grabbed 'Srorkv’s hand,
and, shaking it hard, followed Mr. Jumbo
Lawson into the street.
“How far away has your friend got the
nag stabled, Mr. Lawson?” he asked.
‘‘Not more than half-a-mile away from
here, in some srabies at the rear of a hotel in
West Melbourne,” Mr. Lawson answered.
ilaii-an-hour later found the pair in a
stable at tne rear of the hotel mentioned.
A small, rat-faced man was rubbing down a
horse, and a good-looking thoroughbred at
that.
"Where’s Mr. Armour, Jack?” asked Mr.
Lawson.
"In th’ pub, I think, Mr. Lawson,” an-
swered Jack.
“Come on,” and Jumbo grasped the squat-
ter in a friendly way by the arm, "we’ll
soon ferret him out.”
The ferreting process proved easy, for
they found Mr. Armour leaning over the bar
talking confidentially ui tne barmaid. Law-
son introduced lnm to the squatter, and
over drinks told him why he had been sought
out.
“Yes,” admitted Mr. Armour musingly,
“I'm willing to sell King Sarius at a figure.
But not a penny under £200.”
“That’s all right,” boomed Mr. Brownson ;
“I’m prepared to go that far if he suits.”
The conspirators exchanged winks behind
his back. "Very good, then,” remarked the
owner of King Sarius, “we’ll go out and have
a look at him.”
For a quarter of an hour the squatter
viewed and rubbed and pawed the horse
over. He looked at his teeth, and felt his
fetlocks, and then, straightening himself, an-
nounced, “I’ll take him.”
Mr. Lawson with great difficulty re-
strained himself from breaking into a jig;
then, leading the way back into the hotel,
asked permission to use a private room.
With great promptitude Mr. Armour brought
forth pens and ink and a blotting-pad. The
three seated themselves at the table; then
Mr. Brownson, glancing up at the clock, re-
marked suddenly, “Half-past three ! Good
Lord ! I had no idea it was so late. The
banks are closed by this time, I s’pose. Too
late to get the money out of the bank to-day.
So I’m afraid you’ll have to take my cheque
for the £2OO. Will that suit you?”
Jumbo and Mr. Armour looked at each
other for a moment or two—they distrusted
cheques as a rule—but, as the squatter
pulled a cheque-book from his pocket, Jumbo
answered quickly, “Yes, that’ll do us.”
“That’ll do you, all right,” commented Mr.
Brownson, as he reached for a pen. Then
he paused suddenly, and, clapping his pockets
violently, exclaimed, “Well, if this isn’t a
nuisance!”
With looks of cohcern in their eyes the
two sharpers watched these acrobatics.
“What’s wrong, Mr. Brownson?” asked
Jumbo anxiously.
Mr. Brownson exploded. “Here I am
stuck. I wanted to buy a stump-jump
plough before I went home,” and, flipping
the cheque-book, “I’ve only got one
cheque-form left. And I want that stump-
jump plough more than I want the horse.”
Shaking his head, he added: “I’m afraid the
horse deal’s off, gentlemen. I’m sorry:
but I promised a neighbor of mine I’d get
him that plough. And I’m going to do it.
And I can’t wait another day. But, any-
way, I’ll probably be down in a month or
so’s time, and if you’ve still got the horse,
Mr. Armour, I’ll take him off your hands.”
Thrusting the elieque-book back in his pocket,
he rose. , ,
This action of finality almost caused the
pair of crooks to collapse in despair, as they
saw the result of their caret uliy-thought-out
scheme going for naught—-the purchase of the
intro, from SnOrky for a tenner, the tem-
porary “borrowing” of the well-known city
performer King Sarius, and the squaring of
his rat-faced attendant. 'The situation . was
desperate:
“l’Taps we could get you another cheque-
form, Mr. Brownson,” suggested Jumbo.
“What’s” -
“No, young man,” exclaimed Mr. Brown-
son, “it doesn’t matter. If I can’t do it
out of me own cheque-book I’m not going to
bother about other folk’s. ; No, it
rest till I come down again.”
Jumbo swore inwardly. Then, in a voice
he strove to keep from trembling, Jumbo mo-
tioned the squatter to seat himself. With a
look of surprise in his eyes, Mr. Brownson
did so. Then feeling in his breast-pocket
Jumbo pulled out a roll of notes.
“Mr. Brownson,” he said, as he fumbled
with the elastic band that was fastened
around the roll, “perhaps I could help you,
and at the same time help my friend.” He
paused a moment, and, as the squatter con-
tinued to eye him gravely, he continued,
“How much will that plough cost ?”
“Twenty pounds,” replied Brownson, ‘and
I’ve got just three pounds in ready cash on
me.”
“Well, Mr. Brownson, would you accept
the loan of twenty pounds from me? You
can post your cheque for that_ amount when
you get home. And —and, still buy King
Sarius.” , „ .
Mr. Brownson pondered over the offer for
a moment or two. Then he looked up sud-
denly and pulled out his cheque-book. \V ell,
he said, “it certainly is a way out of the
difficulty. I can’t afford to disappoint Daw-
kins over his plough —he’s too good a neigh-
bor of mine. And —well, yes, if you’ll trust
me, I’ll take it.”
Three minutes later he handed over a
cheque for £2OO, and received from his friend
Mr. Dawson a number of bank-notes valued
at £2O. Then for a quarter of an hour
they continued talking and making arrange-
ments for the cartage of King Sarius to Jmg
Jing. After which, with feelings o.f mutual
satisfaction, the duped and the dupes parted.
An hour later, Snorky, sitting impatiently
in the bar-room of the Three Stars, looked up
to see his cobber. Mr. Joseph Briggs, enter
the room. For one suffering from rheuma-
tism Joseph’s behavior was surprising. He
proceeded to do a shuffling sort of jig on the
floor; then, in answer to the question in
Snorky’s eyes, “Yes, got 20 of the best out
of ’em. But, by Cripes, I’m glad to <ret
away from them damn whiskers, and that
grease-paint. I don’t vrant t’ be a squatter
any more for a while —too much of a job
watchin’ y’self. Wonder what’ll happen
when Jumbo presents that cheque I gave
him.!”
“The ambulance for a pair of crooks suf-
ferin’ from a apoplectic fit/’ cackled Snorky.
“Here, fill ’em up!”
