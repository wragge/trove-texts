London Verses
Cherry Gardens (Rotherhithe.)
My man fell in, when he was drunk;
They'd thrown him out o' the •“ King's
' Head,"
From Wapping stairs he fell, and sunk.
He was my man; he’s dead.
On the cold slab, a sight to see,
They've laid him out —poor handsome
chap —
In Rotherhithe's new mortuary.
Ilis head should dent my lap,
But I mayn't warm him where he lies
Because I hove no ring to show;
Yet I've his bruises on my eyes:
And bore his child a month ago.
Acacia Road.
All down Acacia Road there are small bow
windows
Jutting out neighborly heads in the street,
And in each sits, framed, a quiet old woman.
They watch the couples who pass or meet.
And some have borne sons, now ageing men;
And most have seen death in their narrow
house;
Heard wedding bells for their grandchildren ;
Seen boys seek the bar for a last carouse;
And heard wives cry, through thin plaster
walls,
And watched babies laugh in the sun out-
side.
They treasure things up in their withered
old hearts,
And always they sit looking out, with eyes
wide.
These queer old women, they watch, as they
sit
Through the whole long day, what happens
beneath:
They miss not a thing. Sometimes they
knit,
And sometimes dream a little, holding their
breath.
THE BALLAD OF THE BRAVE SOLDIES.
She tcandered by the river's brink,
Her stricken heart stood still:
She listened for his hastening step,
With mind to win or kill.
From Ipswich up to London Town
Long days, long nights walked she:
And now had tracked her soldier down
Who caused her shame to be.
She could not breathe, her throat grew dry,
Her soldier looked so brave and strong:
“Why, Moll, my girl”—she heard him cry —
“What brings you here along?"
“From Ipswich, Dick, I've brought the son,"
She moaned, “your broken promise gave."
He looked and laughed: “Poor little one!
I've used you ill, I have."
She sank, and saw him smile good-bye —
She who had thought to kill or win.
He was too fine, too bold to die,
The weak must suffer for his sin.
From “Streets: a Book of London Verses,”
by Douglas Goldring (Goschen, 35.).
Britain’s "Local” Navy
Richard Jebb’s Studies in Colonial
Nationalism was the first outside recogni-
tion of a fact that is a commonplace in the
Dominions —that each is already a nation
and inspired by its national patriotism. And
in The Britannic Question (Longmans,
Green) he continues the good work of
educating Bull out of his hereditary im-
pression that he “owns” his “colonies.” The
Britannic question is the question of the
alternatives before the Empire; whether it
shall become a closely united Imperial
Federation or remain an Imperial Alliance.
The problem is simply this: how to co-
ordinate five or six separate governments
under some system which, without impairing
their several sovereignties, would enable
them to work together more effectively for
common purposes.
j*
The British Empire has “just growed.”
But it cannot, without the grave possibility
of disaster, be allowed to muddle through.
The whole recent trend of British effprt
has been to exclude the Dominions from all
consultation on Imperial foreign policy and
the important question of defence. We are
to be “informed,” not “consulted.” And
Bull’s recent policy with regard to the
Dominions is to centralise the Imperial
navy and discourage the creation of allied
fleets. Unfortunately for this British ideal,
the Australian navy is already in being.
The policy of Conservatism in England is
thus stated: —
The creation of a central authority
equipped with power not only to repel
aggression but also to maintain Britannic
law and order, i.e., to repress inter-State
disturbances or any attempt at secession...
Conservatism would find the key to the
whole problem in centralised authority, par-
ticularly as to the naval and military forces
of the Empire. Get the fighting power cen-
tralised, and then you will have clipped the
wings of the colonies and there could re-
main no real danger of a Laurier or Botha
or desperate White-Australian asserting in-
dependence.
This attitude is the result of the “our
Colonies” fetich :
A century of empire-getting and empire-
ruling could scarcely have failed to imbue
the British at home with a complacent sense
of possession in the oversea territories of
the Crown, and of suzerainty, at least, over
the populations thereof. In British eyes the
people of the self-governing colonies —-free
tenants of England’s territory, but still sub-
jected to a suzerain in international affairs
—acquired an inferior or “colonial” status,
carrying with it the moral obligation of
humble and grateful “loyalty”.... Nature
constantly reasserts herself in the familiar
phrase “ our colonies” —not colonies merely,
but colonies the apanage of Britain —which
is still (despite the reluctant official reform
in 1907) the ordinary way in Britain of
referring to the Dominions.... The ex-
pression marks the user as mentally dis-
qualified for Britannic statesmanship.
Judged by this simple but sufficient test, the
present British Cabinet (Liberal) has been
found to yield not a single member with the
modern outlook.
J*
In reference to the despised statesman-
ship of the Dominions, Jebb contrasts the
handling of the Asiatic immigration ques-
tion by California with that of the
Commonwealth, Canada and the Union.
The Dominions have had the power to em-
broil the Empire, had they chosen, yet they
have made no trouble for the Imperial
Government like that which California has
made for the Washington Government.
An Imperial Federation, with Britain pos-
sessing -the majority of the voting power,
would mean that the Commonwealth must
surrender the control of its navy, and all
the Dominions some part of the control of
their military forces. Also, the Dominions
must resign their independence in regard to
Asiatic immigration, their separate right to
make commercial treaties, their control over
their tariffs, and would have very little in
the shape of enlarged powers to balance
those considerable losses of autonomy.
However, Britain, in a federated Empire,
with voting powers given to each dominion,
would have to modify her foreign policy in'
upsetting the old tradition that nothing ob-
noxious to the United States must ever be
insisted upon.
Certainly Canada, Australia and M.L.
would not be disposed to take “lying down”
such treatment as the threatened discrimina-
tion on the Panama Canal.
Freetrade within the Empire is possible
on one condition. National Protection
against Britain is our policy only so long
as Bull’s standard of living for industrial
workers is lower than ours.
Were the level of “white” wages practic-
ally uniform among the Britannic demo-
cracies, the case for protecting the industry
of one against another’s might soon lose its
mainstay. Already Freetrade between Aus-
tralia and M.L. is regarded as a possibility
of the near future, their social conditions
being on a common level.
Britain is the backward partner, the
blackleg in regard to labor conditions. Let
Britain lift herself to our “white” level and
we should receive her. But, of course, Jebb
has not taken full cognisance of the need
we have of some measure of protection even
against nations working on the same wage:
we have to plant new industries in a new
country, to compete on level terms with
industries already established in Britain.
And even an inter-state Freetrade Empire
would need a tariff barrier against all other
nations. But the position of the Dominions
in an imperial Federation would be intoler-
able. For such a Federation would “dis-
perse young and vigorous national patriot-
isms which are successfully evolving the
institutions required for their expression.”
And Jebb puts the point strongly that had
the Empire been a federal one in the recent
past, there would have been no insti-
tution of national service in Australia,
M.L. or any other part of the Empire, since
Australia and Maoriland were impelled to
take that plunge mainly bv. the withdrawal
of the British fleets from the outer oceans
to the home waters of Britain.
J*
The “local navy” of Australia, with its
higher rates of pay, is effecting a reform
that Britain has hitherto refused, except
partially, to undertake. We are entering
into competition with the British recruiting
officer, and we have better conditions and a
higher wage to offer. The only course open
to Britain, the employer who pays low
wages and offers inefficient accommodation,
is to improve the conditions of her seamen.
And that, Jebb says, “may be worth, at no
distant date, a good many dreadnoughts.”
But it is also whispered that the British
naval officer can make nothing of “the un-
ruly Australian.”
One cannot readily believe that men so
adaptable as are the Australians are
impossible material for a modern naval ser-
vice. To say so must be to condemn not
them but the naval authorities, who would
stand convicted of incapacity to do what is
being done in every other business, namely,
to meet chanered times with changed
methods. If the Australian and Canadian
peoples, undismayed by taunt or difficulty,
will set themselves to the task, they can be
trusted to evolve eventually a new order,
under which their own naval services would
not be repellent to men reared in larger
freedom, and the example of which would
stimulate the progress of similar reform in
the Old Country.
Thus our delightful task is to show an
example to Britain in the up-to-date man-
agement of modern navies.
The critics of naval alliances are
dealing with an alliance that is the
first of its kind in history. Ours is a naval
alliance which consists of individually
designed “fleet units” for combined service,
standardised as regards types of vessels,
guns and ammunition, uniform as regards
schools of strategy, officers’ training, tactics,
and language of command, intended to be
associated in manoeuvres and through inter-
change of personnel, and arranged to be
placed under one control in warfare.
It seems a curious instinct, to those who
do not share it, which distrusts the potential
competence of Australia and Canada, as
States in alliance with Britain, to discharge
the same responsibility which has cheerfully
been entrusted to foreign Japan. All navies
must have a beginning, and less than 30
years ago the Japanese .naval power, as also
the German, was non-existent. Yet the
modern proposals, first in Australia and then
in Canada, to begin the creation of a Do-
minion navy, have been successively received
in English quarters with derision of the
possibility, and at a later stage with ill-
concealed alarm at the impending actuality.
.. . Strategically, then, one may safely con-
clude that if the principle of a naval alliance
can be worked in conjunction with Japan
and E’rance, a fortiori, can it be worked in
conjunction with the Dominions.
The trouble is that the Bull cannot recog-
nise that the Dominions are for naval pur-
poses separate nations like Japan and
France. As for centralisation, technically
it is superior, but “the superior driving force
of national patriotism as compared with
imperial compulsion” is an important factor
of efficiency. And :
Decentralisation, again, might minimise
the risk of the whole system becoming rotten
together, or of its being destroyed by a heavy
blow at the heart....As for the strategical
disposition of fleets, if the British Govern-
ment was politically able to maintain a
squadron in the South Pacific, why should
it be deemed politically impossible for an
Australian Government to maintain ships in
the North Sea or the Mediterranean?
Again. Aren’t we, perhaps, a little too
apt to regard the British Admiralty as a
divine institution?
The implicit confidence shown by Mr. Bor-
den in the continuous wisdom and efficiency
of the British Admiralty is characteristic of
imperial-federalists overseas; but can hardly
be shared by any who have followed the in-
dependent criticism of its modern adminis-
tration, and have noticed that certain specific
and telling indictments seem to remain un-
answered. The analogy of the centralised
War Office, with the gigantic incompetence it
displayed in South Africa —an incompetence
mitigated in the crisis by the happy fact
that it failed to drag the Dominions into
its net —must inspire some misgiving as to
how the Admiralty might tunerve from that
vital test which has not arisen for a hundred
years
For the alleged Imperialists of Australia
Jebb has something further to say about
“local navies.” First, the British navy is a
“local” navy, as it is a force, like that of
Australia, designed for general service
abroad, but restricted by political exigencies
to home waters. Also it is a “local” navy,
inasmuch as it is normally kept under local
control instead of being assigned to the
control of, say, the Empire. In fact, it is
more of a “local” navy than that of the
Commonwealth, for Australia contemplates
merely the localisation of peace control —
not, as in the British navy, of ships. And
the R.A.N. is a fleet unit, originated and
approved by the Admiralty .itself only four
years ago, though now, according to the
London Times, even the Admiralty can make
a mistake.
Probably the local feeling in Britain,
where invasion panic is now chronic be-
cause -the danger seems real, would forbid
the despatch of any British unit to the
Pacific for the purpose of combined training
or for strengthening an outlying fleet of the
Empire. That fleet would, therefore, have
to be provided by the Dominions alone.
In their case the fear of invasion is now
relatively negligible, because they, in con-
trast with Britain, are already taking mili-
tary measures to deal with any hostile ex-
peditionary force that could probably be
sent against them at short notice....
Therefore, the Dominion fleets’ units would
seem likely to be mobile, instead of being
strictly localised like Britain’s navy to-day.
And in his final plea against the “gift
dreadnought” foolishness of Maoriland. and,
possibly, Canada, Jebb concludes
Surely the best service that the Dominions
could now render would be to make clear
that their own resources shall be applied
resolutely to retrieving the lost position in
the eastern hemisphere rather than for re-
lieving wealthier Britain of her own local
duty to herself and to the Empire.
A heartening book for all patriotic Aus-
tralians —and a bomb for all local Empire
Day elocutionists.
For every person who condemns the
“local navy” is disloyally expressing his con-
tempt of the most tied-up and most “local”
navy in the Empire—the British Navy.
Verses by Fritz S. Burnell
Fritz S. Burnell is another of them. He
writes little verses pleasantly, and he wiH
probably keep on writing them. He loves
a sonorous or a tricky line, meaning
nothing:—
Of chrysoprase and beryl and chrysolite ....
Of the cold kisses and white arms of death..
Insate and insatiable lust....
Dark with the doom of all the centuries —.
An infinite, indefinite desire....
And he is addicted to dots, which give that
vague feeling of so much that is inexpres-
sible, and, incidentally, save the poet the
trouble of expressing it. Aud he is fond of
polyglottic titles: “Ultra” and “Exiturus”
and “Taedium Amoris”; he has a “Nacht-
stuck,” “Un R@ve,” a “Traumlieder,” a
"Fantasie de Lune,” an “Impression de
Nuit” and a “Fin du Jour.” These give an
air of erudition and exoticism. And
his “Other Poems” are all readably brief.
Thus, one of them, “The Lover Wishes that
he could Build an Ivory Tower for his
Beloved,” takes three lines of title to crown
a six-line poem. And, after all, he dodges
building that ivory tower. Now, an ivory
tower would be a beautiful thing, and, set
anywhere in George-street, it would prove
a fine advertisement for his beloved; but
Fritz S. Burnell merely builds a six-storeyed
poem. This is not fair either to his beloved
or to his reader. Yet most of his poems are
poems, dainty, vague, fleeting things, not
powerfully felt and therefore but faintly ex-
pressed. The pulse that beats through them
is weak, but the rhythm of that pulse is
pleasantly lulling. And, really, there is no
reason at all why Fritz S. Burnell should
nrtt go happily on doing this delicate,
dainty sort of thing indefinitelv. For he
really does it very nicely.
ONCE.
She came and stood by my side,
Once —it was long ag0....
I was writing a poem, I know,
And she left me: I think she sighed. . ..
Once, she spoke of a need. .. .
But I could not hear her, it seems,
For voices' called in my dreams,
And bade me pay her no heed.
And once, I recall to mind,
She sang to me, all night long,
But the wind had another song,
And at dawn I followed the wind. .. .
But the poem was never read:
And one's dreams depart with the years;
And the wind has a sound of tears....
Not mine. .. .1 have none to shed.
A MANGROVE SWAMP.
Look how the slow, fat bubbles break in
rings,
As though a man were stifling underneath.
The black, stagnating water by no breath
Is stirred, a mirror for all evil things.
The long roots writhing upward from, the
mud,
Like fingers crooked ih lust or pain or greed,
Have pendent tresses of putrescent weed ,
Like dead men's hair clogged stiff with their
own blood.
No light of flowers nor songs of birds dispel
The breathless, stealthy silence of the place.
Only a ripple o'er spreads the water's face
At times, like soundless, dreadful mirth in
hell.
Only the grey mists come and go beneath
The pallid shadows of the sickly moon;
Only dead voices in the night-breeze croon
A drear and melancholy masque of death.
From “Before Dawn and Other Poems,”
(W. Brooks, Sydney).

ARE YOU AS WELL AS YOU SHOULD BE?
Or do you suffer from
Weakness
When your system is weakened by worry, overwork,
illness, or any other cause—when you feel listless
and low spirited—“Wincarnis” will promptly in-
vigorate and strengthen you. Directly you have
taken a wineglassful of a Wincarnis” you will feel a delicious stimulating
effect. This is caused by “Wincarnis” being immediately absorbed into
the system, thereby stimulating the heart —revitalising the blood—rebuilding
the lost vitality and creating new energy. And
each succeeding glassful still further invigorates
and strengthens you. Every wineglassful makes
you stronger than you were before. Thus by
taking “Wincarnis” regularly for a few days, you will derive new health,
new strength, new vigor, new energy and new life. Buy a bottle to-day
and test this for yourself.
Sleeplessness
Sleeplessness is due to a disorganised con-
dition of the brain cells. The body may
be thoroughly worn out, but, owing to the
excitable and highly-strung state of the
brain, sleep is impossible. Only those who suffer from sleeplessness can
realise the intense misery of the incessant tossing to and fro—the agonising
wait for daybreak—and the feeling of utter exhaustion in the morning.
But a wineglassful of “Wincarnis” taken
the last thing at night will compose and
soothe the highly-strung brain, and ensure
f _ an uninterrupted and sweetly refreshing
night’s rest. And while you are asleep “Wincarnis” is busy storing your
system with energy in readiness for another day’s work. Buy a bottle
to-day. J
“ Run- Down ”
The body is continually wasting away, and
the energy is being continually used up.
So long as the body is able to replace this
waste the system will be normally healthy.
But, unfortunately, the rush and tear of
up the energy and vitality faster than the

body becomes enfeebled—the nerves are
partially starved—and we suffer from
lassitude, depression and weariness.
Nothing acts so promptly or so effect-
a “run-down” condition as “Wincarnis.” A few wine-
will give you new vigor, new vitality and new life. Try
Coug'hs, Colds and Chills
You cannot bo too careful at this time of the year. The chilly evenings—
the dampness underfoot—the fogs and treacherous winds, are causing an
epidemic of Coughs, Colds, and Chills. The complaints are bad enough in
themselves, but the real danger is that, unless properly checked, they are so
liable to turn to Bronchitis, Asthma, Catarrh, Pneumonia, Consumption
and Influenza. Warm clothing is not sufficient protection. You need
warmth from within-jt he warmth that “Wincarnis” creates. After taking
a wineglassful of WiAearnis” you will feel a warm, grateful glow all over
the body That is inner Warmth— natural warmth—warmth that will
a equately protect you from Cdnghs, Colds and Chills. Buy a bottle to-day,
and prove this for yourself. ;
To-day Is the best day to commence taking “ Wlncarnis." Buy a bottle to-day from your Wine Merchant
or Licensed Chemist or Grocer, and test Its marvellous strengthening properties.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“W.F.”: On top of his sugar and oil monopolies
the Wellington (M.L.) man, who also pays extrava-
gantly for his gas, begins to smell something in the
cow-fat trade. Of course, the dealers deny that
there is a ring; but when it is known that in Pal-
merston (97 miles away) and New Plymouth (200
miles away) the same quality butter for which
Wellington pays Is. 6d. is retailed at Is. Id and
Is. 2d., people begin to suspect that the dealers
could find Ananias somewhere in their family tree.
“U.J.S.”: Commissioner Russell, of Adelaide—he’s
S. Australia’s nearest equivalent to a District Court
Judge—fell like the walls of Jericho the other day
upon a debt-collector who had foisted his “ex-
penses” upon <a miserable debtor. His Honor pointed
out the illegality of the action; but nine times out
of 10, illegal or not, the debtor (or more usually
the debtor’s wife) pays the charge, not so much
to avoid the court proceedings as to “keep out o’
the papers.” The collector hereabouts is very often
a money-lender as well, and in such case his ulti-
matum of “immediate payment or immediate legal
proceedings” is accompanied by a notice which
states that money is lent on reasonable security. If
the fly is caught, the spidei- weaves a beautiful web
about him, and when he escapes, there isn’t much
blood left in him. But the methods of some business
firms can be as bad. Here’s a case. A boarding-
house-keeper was on the books of her butcher for
£34. She had taken six years to owe him the
amount. At the lowest computation she had paid
him £312 in that time. He stopped her credit
and got a verdict. Under the threat of the
dreaded Unsatisfied Judgment summons—a savage
thing which in S. Aus. usually means gaol—she was
pliable to his proposal, Tl)is was that she should
borrow the money from him, giving him a bill of
sale over her household furniture. She already had
a bill of sale for £5O, of which £lO was still
owing. 'The kind butcher paid this, and then his
joyous little bill pranced after this fashion:—
Debt •. ..£B4 0 0
Interest on overdue accounts for
' six years at 6 per cent. .. 10 4 o
Money lent to pay moneylender 10 0 0
Interest on new loan .. .. 15 16 o
Cost of registering bill of sale. . 10 0
Total £7l 0 0
This she has to pay off at the rate of £1 per week
under pains and penalties that make the woman
shiver every time she thinks of them—which is
nearly all the time. When will our up-to-date muni-
cipality provide us with municipal pawnbrokery? I
don’t know anything that would give our very poor
more immediate relief.
“Sydneyite”: “Ricardo” (B. 17/7/’l3), writing of
the Maffra (Vic.) beet-sugar business, supplies only
a compilation of mis-statements. Instead of the
outlook being “very gloomy,” it is most encourag-
ingly bright. The growers for the past two years
have suffered through bad seasons; notwithstanding
this, instead of being “a complete failure,” in most
cases the only crop harvested at all was sugar beet.
As to a third of the growers having quitted, the
fact is the acreage has been more than doubled this
year. Good land will easily raise 16 tons per acre,
which sold at 235. per ton means £l7 ss. gross
return—g. pretty good paying proposition. As to
the expert in charge of the industry, I am in a posi-
tion to know that since his arrival in Australia, a
little over two years ago, offers have been made for
him to return to America, and also to other countries.

“Pa Pooa”: George Billby, educated colored gen-
tleman and copra trader, had his station in one of
the many obscure bays on the North-East Coast of
Papua. His order for stores came to hand on a
piece of white trade calico, and read:—
“Plese sent i 11 dozing herons 1 roled Oaths
1 A.M. £7 1 t 1 Flowr and I Quean Ann. N.B
Plese tell i the rite time, i feal krook. Praps i
sent u cobra byem-boy. i doan no. good buv
Jorge Biluby.”
Being gifted with second sight Smith sent him-
2 doz. herrings, 1 tin rolled oats, 1 71b. ham, 1 tin
tea, 1 tin flour.
But the “Quean Ann” beat him. “What the devil
does he want?” Smith growled. “The ??? has three
wives now 1” The mention of our client’s “krook-
ness gave Smith the idea. “I know what the
blighter wants,” he said, making for the quinine
shelf. There, he said, dabbing the bottle on the
counter. “Now the only thing we can’t send him is
the right time.”

. “Coorey”: Up on the North Coast (N.S.W.), what
isnt cow is generally wood. If the inhabitant—
oldest, middfe-ag-ed, or youngest—isn’t a cocky, you
can bet he’s either a timber getter or timber worker
As for the “poor cocky,” half his tuberculous herds
are never seen by the Agricultural Department’s in-
spectors; but for unblush ng effrontery the sleeper-
getter must be handed the biscuit. 'lie can take
down the average inspector of the Works Department
any day of the week. I have seen an inspector stand
30 or 40 feet away from the stack, and “pass” the
sleepers as they were turned over by the men who
had chopped them. When any are condemned (and
an inspector of that sort usually condemns a few in
order to save his face), the chopper merely dumps them
into, the nearest available river or water-course, and
awaits the arrival of the next man, when they are, as
a rule, duly passed as being part of a new consign-
ment. Another favorite dodge of the timber man is
to substitute blackbutt for tallow-wood, as the
latter commands a far higher price. The method is
simple and effctive. To the ordinary, untrained eye
there is little difference between the two timbers.
All that it is necessary to do to wipe out the
apparent difference is to spread a few bags of saw-
dust over the stack of blackbutt, give it a good
drink, and the trick is done.
STEAMSHIP M.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
O’ nights the sun goes down redly—flames through
the dust and smoke
That curls and drifts from a myriad funnels the sky
to stain ;
But the smoke of one little vessel is streaming
across unbroke,
The smoke from one little funnel is blowing across
my brain.
And nights of fog I hear whistles cry from the
water. Hark!
Echoing over the cliff face where the fog-drifts break
and part—
And the livelong night there are sirens echoing
through the dark,
But there’s one little, shrill little siren that echoes
through my heart.
And at the wharves in the morning—there are great
ships lying there,
And web and network of cables that cross and sag
apart,
But there’s one dark little cable, all wet and still in
the air—
There’s one strong little cable that’s twisted round
my heart.
And many an engine is throbbing, while the spouting
wavelets fall
Across the foam at the bows where the waters whiten
apart,
But the beat of one little engine is clearer far than
them all—
The beat of one little engine is like the beat of my
heart.

A Complete Milk and Farinaceous Food.
Easy of Digestion, Most Agreeable to take, Simply and Quickly made.
The ‘Allenburys’ Diet is recommended for general use in place of ordinary milk foods, gruel, etc. and is
particularly adapted to the needs of Dyspeptics, Invalids and the Aged. Being largely predigested it is
easy of assimilation. A cup of the ‘Allenburys’ Diet is useful in the forenoon, between meals.
The ‘Allenburys’ Diet may be taken with advantage, on going to bed, in the place of stimulants.
Being easily digested it promotes tranquil and
refreshing sleep, free from the depressing re-
action ir the morning, which often follows
the taking of spirits.
For those who cannot readily digest milk the
‘Allenburys’ Diet is a welcome substitute, as it
does not cause indigestion and flatulence.

The Ammunition You Buy
WHAT make of ammunition are you going
to shoot this year ? Talk with the keen
sportsman—ask the dealer who is alert
and can speak with authority*
You will find that the interest to-day
centres more and more in Remington-UMC as
the dependable ammunition, not only for

“My System”
By LIEUT J. P. MULLER.
(Formerly of Royal'Danish Engineers. Late
Inspector, Danish Tubercular Sanatorium.)
“ My System ” consists of a series of scientifically
devised bodily movements followed by a bath (cold
or tepid) and self-massage. It can be graded to
suit people of all ages. It promotes beauty of
physique—not abnormal protuberance-by har-
moniously developing each muscle according to its
need ; it gently and effectively stimulates the vital
organs, thus enabling them to rid the system of the
poisons which cause functional ailments; and
maintains the skin and body in a perfect condition
of natural health. “My System ” has been used
and endorsed by:
Ex-President Roosevelt, Lord Al-
verstone, Rev. F. B. Meyer, Field
Marshal Von Moltke.Sir K.S.Baden
Powell, Sir A. Conan Doyle, and many
other public men and eminent physicians. Every
doctor who has investigated it advocates it for the
cure of—Constipation, Rheumatism, Indigestion,
Insomnia, and kindred complaints. The Whole
System can be performed in 15 minutes.

these, thin arms ind hollow cheeks are a rarity.
No woman need stay thin and undeveloped. Dr. Falliere’s FLESH-FOOD

TORTURING VARICOSE VEINS.
Many old, stubborn cases, even where ulcers of 20 years’ standing were present,
have been cured in a few weeks, the worst cases responding as readily as those only
recently developed. If you are a sufferer you should obtain particulars of this
wonderful remedy.
THE VECSEY METHOD
of treatment quickly stops the
pain and subdues the existing
inflammation. Its continued application eradicates the accumulation that distends
the veins, and restores the valves and walls to their original healthy state. It is
essentially a home treatment, and cures without laying ud or detention from your
ordinary duties, and has been successful in hundreds of cases formerly given up as
hopeless. It is enthusiastically endorsed by hundreds who once suffered.
To sufferers from Varicose Veins the Vecsey Method of treatment comes as a
great boon. Previous to its discovery no painless, permanent palliative was
known. It cures the veins absolutely, so that they do not return.

A Great Deal of George.
Duiing his stay in England Mr. Joseph Ward saw
a great deal of Mr. George Reid.
lie is looking very well, and is in good spirits,”
remarked Mr. Ward.—C lieery news item.
Westminster Abbey, St. Paul’s and the
Tower—
Around them the sight-chasers gibber and
glower.
Ihe Houses of Parliament, Buckingham
Palace—-
All great things that awe the most worldly
and callous.
Memorials, monuments, columns and
arches—
Big Heaps on the round where Time stolidly
marches —-
Impress and confound
All those that stand round,
With their splendid profundity,
Weight and rotundity,
Until they all shrill in small voices, “Amaz-
ing !”
And stand like black ants while they worship
by gazing.
But the worshippers all would be very soon
shot of it
If they couldn’t see a Gargantuan ‘lot of it” ;
For a heap, or a pile, or a load, or a stack
Is regarded with awe, when a fair, average
whack
Would be laughed at and sc. rned, for the
gluttonous tripper
For his fair pound of fat brings a tub and
a dipper ;
Therefore George, in his way, is a regular
treasure,
For of eyeglass and vest he gives wonderful
measure.
The caller can gaze on his saccharine smile,
And thrill with the thought, ‘‘lie’s all mine
for a while!”
Who would gloat o’er a thin and an acid
Commissioner
When there’s such a splendidly fat High
Conditioner?
One might ransack the world for a long,
footsore century
Before he pulled out such a plenipotentiary.
All respecters of fat men and globular
beauty
Should visit George Howstout. This national
duty
Devolves on the tripper. His front eleva-
tion —
Too nol le for words —-credit does to the
nation.
It’s doubtful indeed if. we knew’ what his
leisure meant
When he was with us. But his splendid
-waist measurement
Advertises us well at each banquet and
dinner,
So our loyal prayer should be: May George
never grow thinner.”
May he speak well, and eat well, and drink
at each gorge,
So that people like Ward,
When they travel abroad,
May report that they’ve witnessed “a great
deal of George.”

Topical Song.
(With moral.)
Bill Lympson caught the small-pox scare
The papers told him to “Beware,”
The doctor terrified him.
He watched himself with nervous care,
And dreamed of spots inside him.
Though none had died of the disease
His soul was agitated,
And, trembling somew’hat at the knees,
Poor Bill got vaccinated.
An illness, which began with flu.,
And ended up with pleuro-pneu.,
Took off his dad (a builder).
He lost his ag£d mother, too,
For typhoid fever killed her.
He buried them in handsome style —
Best polished oak (and pall) box
But all his terrors all the while,
Were fixed upon the small-pox.
Enwrapped in gauze to keep them warm,
Three pustules blossomed on his arm ,
It hurt him much when held up.
And then, to add to Bill’s alarm,
His old appendix swelled up.
His temples throbbed ; he went to bed.
Bedewed with perspiration :
And when he died the doctor said
“A splendid vaccination.”
Police appeared upon the scene,
They burned the house with kerosene
To rid it of infection :
The neighbors went to quarantine
And took up a collection.
For William’s wife and kiddies, who
On him had been dependent.
And then they wisely went and slew
llis medical attendant.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

OUR POOR ARMS!
The soreness of the public arm, the un-
pleasant pains shooting across the chest of
William Smith, the fever which kept
Mary Jones five davs from her accustomed
place at the typewriter, and all the other
accompaniments of the fearsome business
which went under the assumed name of vac-
cination, but which was in reality compound
mutilation, ought to have driven home a few
lessons that some people pretty badly needed.
We have it on the authority of those pains
and penalties that Sydney was utterly un-
prepared for an outbreak of small-pox. The
vaccine required was not on .the spot, and
quantities had to be obtained by ship from
Maoriland. and even from nlaces like
New Caledonia, where the leprosy perman-
ently resides. The surgical skill required
was" not on the spot, though any number of
doctors, who were as unpractised in the sim-
ple operation as they are in dry farming and
aerial navigation, got to work with the energy
and enthusiasm of a band of Bulgarian in-
fantry which had stumbled on a sleeping
Turkish village. They were aware that a hole
had to be made somewhere in the patient,
and a certain amount of lymph laid in the
trench, but comparatively few seemed to
know whether the hole should be the size of
a mosquito bite, or as big as a saucepan,
and there was a difference of opinion as to
whether a wineglassful of the extract or a
full pint constituted the right dose. Sydney
was unprepared ; and if it did not pay the
full penalty which it deserved to,pay. it has
at least suffered enough to make it thought-
ful.
W e were unprepared for an attack of
small-pox: are we equally unprepared
for worse things? Fpr there are
worse things. The invasion of Australia by
disease is, after all, a small matter com-
pared with invasion by an armed force. An
alien microbe of the deadliest sort could
hardly destroy us utterly as a nation and at
one blow blight all our larger hopes of a
White Man’s continent. It could, of course,
kill off a lot of us —and, few as we are, the
weeding out might be to the advantage of
the race. It could also fill our hospitals for
a while, and cause our medical men to lead
the strenuous life for a few weeks, and it
might spoil our beauty by leaving holes and
nodules in place of the lovely peach-bloom
that now flushes the roots of our whiskers.
But, when it was all over, we should go on
with our work of making or marring Aus-
tralia according to our fancy and the mea-
sure of our intelligence. An alien invasion
in force would be quite another matter.
When the big guns began to scatter frag-
ments of jagged ironmongery, and the orphan
bookmaker was liable to mistake his favorite
bar for an exhibit from the ruins of Nine-
veh, the actual death rate might be no higher
than in a full-fledged epidemic; but the re-
sults would be vastly different. The moment
we were compelled to haul down our Aus-
tralian flag, or even make a treaty by which
any right was conceded to Asia to remain
on this continent, our place and standing as
a nation would be gone. Our only chance
lies in our being prepared to offer real re-
sistance at the first point of attack. Once
the tide turned against us our case would
be as hopeless as that of a very angry selec-
tor when several miles of raging bush fire
were concentrating their regiments of flame
upon his doomed cow-yard.
We have shown enthusiasm enough in
meeting the smaller danger. What is our
attitude towards the larger? Let us be
frank with ourselves and say that for the
most part it at least borders on indiffer-
ence. We have a number of children more
or less under arms; a few growing lads who
have undergone a sort of military training;
a gunner here and there who knows the
difference between a 12-inch shell and a St.
Bernard dog ; a few people who wear uni-
forms and goldierly titles; one diminutive
small-arms factory; a projected railway that
may in 15, or 20, or perhaps 50 years be
prepared to carry men and arms to the point
of likely attack; some other railways that
are still practically useless for swift transit
owing to the lack of a uniform gauge, but
which may at some distant date be made
working parts in the machine of defence ; a
number of highly useful and efficient bullock-
teams, not calculated to carry munitions of
war at express speed; and an infinite wil-
lingness on the part of all our citizens to
trust to luck. On the face of it, it does
not look a very efficient organisation for the
protection of a great and valuable continent
against an invasion that would mean, not
the loss of our beauty, but the loss of just
about everything that is worth keeping.
» * * •
By makeshift methods and a wholesale
system of borrowing and importing, we were
able to make some sort of stand against the
invasion we have had. But with an armed
enemy at our gates, there would be no time
either for borrowing military supplies or im-
porting the necessary trained men to do our
fighting. Our nearest Possible helpers are
half a world away, and likely to be as cheer-
fully unprepared to send troops on foreign
service as we to put up a stubborn defence.
The United States might be willing to lend
a hand, Canada might be sympathetic,
Britain might be perturbed ; but the chances
are seriously against any of them being
able to bring one shipload of troops to Aus-
tralia in less than six months. Six months
is not a particularly long time to wait for
a cargo of cheap, imported goods; but six
months is a great deal too long to wait for a
soldier or a rifle when the actual game of
war is being played with cordite and bayo-
nets. The Turks in Thessaly might have
been all right if the Bulgarians had been
willing to wait six weeks, or even six days ;
but the Bulgarian struck at the earliest pos-
sible moment, and all the rest, as far as
Turkey was concerned, was a mere splash of
blood across a oath of humiliation. Once
the bugle blows the Australian defence forces
must be ready to play the game in bitter
earnest. No sort of desperate valor will
make up for lack of preparation in the time
of peace. In modern warfare the unready
nation has not even a remote chance of
muddling through ; and any defence scheme
which ignores this might as well be a scheme
for providing crowded and uncomfortable
graves for the population.
It may not yet be too late to put our
defence on a sound footing, if only we go to
work with tremendous zeal and energy and
persistence. Put the knowledge that the
party in alleged power has always stood for
the great gospel of nothing-in-narticular does
not fill us with hope; and there is still a
dread that the big day of testing will find
us writing off in haste to Ceylon for a barrel
of powder, and imploring the Germans in
Samoa to lend us a drill instructor; : nd,
while we are yoking ur> our war bullocks
for the march to the Northern Territory,
the Asian oickets will be at Pine Creek, and
Asian engineers will be laying their own
rails to push as far South as they care to
come. After that there will be much hasty
cursing and a quantity of sudden death. and
we shall have no time for a hundred vears
to think of erecting a statue to the national
goddess of Tnhp-onr-Dha r>oo
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“The Extortionate Demands of Labor.”
After all the talk about the encroachments
of labor and the greed of the working-man,
Statistician Trivett’s figures show that in
the N. S. Wales manufacturing industries
the proprietors have fared better even than
the employees. Of the total value of the
output in 1908 salaries and wages con-
sumed £l7 19s. per cent.; last year they
consumed £lB 19s. per cent. Thus every
£lOO worth of goods turned out of the
average factory was worth exactly £1 more
to the workpeople in 1912 than it was in
1908. But it was worth £1 13s. 6d. more
to the proprietors. The men who have really
fared worst are the suppliers of raw
material. Of every £lOO represented by the
output of the average factory the men who
turned in the raw materials took £63 10s.
in 1908; last year they took only £6O 15s.
Put in another way, on 45 per cent, more
materials than were used in 1908, the em-
ployees last year got 691 ner cent, more
wages, and the proprietors -ot 68 per cent,
more profit—which profit, of course, includes
interest. That the suppliers of raw
materials have thus got into the backwash
is most likely due to two things in particu-
lar : in the first place, so much of our raw
material is sent out for sale in the ooen
markets of the world, and the price ruling
there governs the price at home. The local
price for wheat, for instance, is governed
by what can be got for the grain in foreign
markets. And foreign markets are gov-
erned by the supplies from cheap-labor
countries like India ; and cheap-labor India
is a very serious competitor, since it pro-
duces four times more wheat than all
Australia. In the second place, the sup-
pliers of raw material suffer severely
through the want of union amongst them.
The tobacco-twisters are highly organised*,
what unionism can do for any body of
workmen it no doubt does for them. * The
last possible penny that can be extracted
from the industry is extracted. But- the
scattered producers of tobacco-leaf are
utterly disunited: they get, not what they
can force, but practically what is left after
the others have had their several-and-re-
spective cuts. It is really rather remark-,
able that, in the circumstances. the
disunited suppliers do as well as the
figures show. In fact, considering the
enormous changes in the production
figures during the past few years—the
value of the State’s factory output went
from 40 millions in' 1908 to 61 millions in
1912—it is a remarkable testimony to the
steadying influence of Wages Boards and
Arbitration Courts that the extra money has
been so well distributed proportionately.
The proceeds go into four sets of pockets—
(l) for raw material; (2) for fuel; (3)
for labor; (4) balance accruing to proprie-
ty. Between 1908 and 1912, both inclu-
sive, there is not a variation of as much as
3 per cent, in the proportion of the whole
value which has gone into any one of these
four pockets. And it says a lot for the fine
bluffing capacity of the employer—the em-
ployer whom we had supposed to be driven
to the very verge of ruin by the extortions
of labor unions—that his proportion shows
the greatest increase of any.
A Record of Three Years’ Good Work.
Ex-Defence Minister Pearce has issued a
“memorandum on relinquishing office,” and
there is enough hustle in it to make Aus-
tralia profoundly regret the loss of an
energetic administrator. The 1908-9 Fisher
Government -had given orders for three tor-
pedo destroyers—one to be pieced together
in Australia from parts made in England,
the others to be built in England. At the
Imperial Conference in 1909 it was de-
cided to establish a Pacific Fleet. Aus-
tralia, Canada and Maoriland were to con-
tribute, Australia’s share being one battle
cruiser, three protected cruisers, three addi-
tional torpedo destroyers and three sub-
marines. To carry defence further, Admiral
Henderson a year later prepared a scheme,
at the invitation of the Commonwealth, for
naval defence. Since then the ' whole de-
partment has been buzzing. The personnel
of the navy grew from 240 in 1910 to 3400
in 1913, the increase being made up by
recruiting locally and by transfers from
the Royal Navy, plus about 3000 roped in
under the scheme for universal service; and
training establishments were started at
Geelong and Williamstown (Vic.) and on
the Tingira in Sydney. The position now,
so far as ships are concerned, is: In com-
mission, including those about to leave Eng-
land, one battle cruiser, four cruisers, two
submarines, three destroyers,; two gunboats,
and two torpedo beats ; building, \ a cruiser,
a destroyer, a submarine depot ship and an
oil supply ship. Not a* dang’erous collec-
tion, perhaps, but a thoroughly ■'good start.
Naval bases have been more or less estab-
lished at Sydney, at FlindersXVic.), Cock-
burn Sound (hear Fremantle, W.A.), and
Port Stephens (N.S.W.), and lapd has been
acquired at Port. Lincoln (S.A.), - Albany
(W.A.), Brisbane (s>), and <'Hobart
(Tas.), hut none at Port DanvinP'*Wire-
less stations have' been" set up at Williams-
town and the Naval office at Melbourne;
and arrangements have a)so been made with
the P.M.G.’s Department and the Defence
Department to the Vise of the postal
stations when Ausfekfflia smells powder. All
this has meant money:—

It is a big burden for a' - youngster like Aus-
tralia to bear; but compared with what
there is to defend it is, after all, a there
bagatelle. There is more than that total
lying loose in a single Australian savings
bank. As for military defence, the recom-
mendations of Lord Kitchener, including
an extension of the universal training sys-
tem, have necessitated many changes.N- The
demand for small arms and, uniforms cqp-
sequent on the big enrolment meant fac-
tories; and since July, 1911, four have been
opened: one for small arms, at Litbgow
(N.S.W.), which cost £149,000; one for
cordite, at Maribyrnong (Vic.), £85,800: a
clothing factory at South Melbourne fore
naval and military, £12,300 ; and a harness
and saddlery factory at Clifton Hill (Vic!),
£6500. A woollen mill (£90,000) at Gee-
long has also been authorised. The small
arms factory can turn out 50 rifles, ■‘with
bayonets, scabbards and accessories per day,
or about 15,000 a year; and new machinery
now being put in will bring the output up
to 20,000 per annum. “Chargers” (steel
clips holding five cartridges) are being
turned out at the rate of 2,500,000 a year.
As the ordinary service rifle has 170 differ-
ent parts and requires 2250 separate opera-
tions before it? is fit to shoot even one Yellow
Peril, it takes time to produce much stock
of the finished goods; but those made to
date have all passed the tests. The cordite
factory can manufacture 54 tons for small
arms a month, and arrangements are being
made to supply big-gun cordite. Both the
clothing and saddlery factories are capable
of turning out stuff equal in quality to that
submitted by tenders, apd at as good a price.
As to the actual forces, the supply of: horses
has been the first consideration, and ’during
the three years 1500 animals were pur-
chased for the field artillery batteries at hn
average cost of £25. The approximateicost
of equipping a, field battery of four guns
has been found to he £20,000; of a Light
Horse regiment. £l3.ooojv of an Infantry
battalion, £12.000. Taking a mixed force,
this means an average of £2O per head,
without uniforms. Thus under universal
training, with a war establishment of
120,000, the cost of equipment will be some-
thing like £2,500,000. Of material for the
ranks the supply has moved along in this
brisk fashion: Junior cadets, in 1910.
24,005, and in 1913, 53,141: seniors, from
10.597 to 89,720 in the same period. Of
Light Horse regiments there were 19: now
there are 23. Field artillery has moved from
16 to 20 batteries; infantry from 32 to 45
battalions: smaller fighting units from 82
to 78; field guns from 56 to 84. The cost
per head (including cadets) in 1910 was
£7 10s.; in 1913 it is £7 ss. Expenditure
has been summarised as follows:—
1912-13.
1910-11. 1911-12. (estimate.

of legislation during the past three years—they had
passed 83 Bills, he believed —it would not be well
to have a period of rest. However, that was not to
be. .. .Although the present circumstances might
appal weak men, they were there to be faced, and the
present Government would face them resolutely.

Work? Do yeh think I’m workin’, mum,
Becos I loves to slave an’ toil?
D'yek think, if I’d a tidy sum,
Ale precious ’ands I’d ever soil?
No, mum! These ’ardskips I indure,
An’ mentions graft, becos I’m poor.
I took this job becos the pay
Wus wot yeh might call pretty good.
But, Lord, I’d loaf the liveionv day
Quite willin’ if I only could.
But all twixt poverty an’ me
Is jist a one majority.
If I ’ad six or seven, say,
I’d sit about an’ take me ease,
An’ eat me fill, an’ dror me pay,
An’ labor only should I please.
But, mum, I’ve no alternative,
I simply ’ave to graft to live.
Now, Andy, ’im ’oo ’ad this cop
(A bigger fool I never see!)
E’d work till ’e wus fit to drop.
’lm ! With ’is big majority !
W’y, ’e wus rich enough to shirk,
An’ yet the chump ’e took on Work!
The story ain’t a long one, mum ;
It’s jist a tale of sheer ’ard luck.
I seen that Andy’s time ’ad come;
I knoo ’is boss was bound to buck.
’E’s so blimed fond er work an’ such
’E’s sacked becos ’e does too much.
So I steps in an’ grabs ’is job,
An’, as me coat I slowly doffed,
I reckons that I’m sure to lob
On somethink easy-like an’ soft.
Thinks I, “Since ’e’s put so much through
There won’t be much fer me to do.”
Ah, mum, but I wus sore mistook,
Fer ’ardly ’ad I settled down
Quite cosy, with a pipe an’ book,
When ’ere’s the boss comes nosin’ roun’.
Says ’e, “Step lively, Joe, yeh yob !
If you don’t work yeh’ll lose yer job!”
’Twas all that cussed Andy’s fault;
’Twas ’im begun this graftin’ craze.
’E never dodged or called a halt;
An’ got the boss used to ’is ways.
An’, ’cos ’is tally’s eiglity-three,
The boss ixpects the same frum me!
A weak man, mum, ’e would ev gone
An’_ dropped ’is bundle right away.
But I’m a demon to ’ang on !
I don’t intend to lose me pay.
Says I, “Now, Joseph, right or wrong,
Pull up yer socks! Yeh must be strong.”
Yes, mum, I’m strong an’ reserloot.
I got me coat off, as yeh see.
I take me oath no Labor broot

An’, d’rec’ly, when I’ve ’ad a wink,
Yeh’ll see me graft like any think !
No, mum, I ain’t done nothink, yet.
Yes, it’s me back mum, an’ the sun.

I’d love to wreck the ’ole blamed ’ouse ;

I’ve reely got a willin’ eart.
No. mum. I can’t divulge me plans.
I can’t ixplain ’em. like off’and :

Yeh’ll say as ’ow yeh ’eard me say

It’s jist bad luck, mum ; bad luck pure.
Rough toil an’ .Toe they don’t agree.

Freetrader —and Black Laborite.
A becent remark of External Affairs Min-
ister Glynn should cause every patriotic
Australian to watch him with particular
closeness. It appears that he recently re-
ceived private letters suggesting that the
task of “developing” the iNorthern Territory
is too heavy for the white man, and that
“black labor from Java will have to be in-
dentured for specified periods to do ,the
heavy clearing and other pioneering work.”
This is diverting, in its way, in view of
what the white man has done, without mak-
ing any fuss, in the tropics and sub-tropics ;
and in the further light of what the black
or colored man hasn’t done in the same
places; and in the still further light of the
disastrous results of introducing "colored
labor into America and S’Africa. A pri-
vate letter writer is, of course, justified in
showing himself to be an ass and an
ignoramus if he be so minded. Minister
Glynn, however, has no such right or ex-
cuse, wherefore his statement, when ques-
tioned on the subject, that “he would say
nothing except that there was no intention
to lower wages, and that he was at present
considering the question of Northern Terri-
tory railway construction, and, incidentally,
the best class of labor to employ ,” lays him
open to the closest scrutiny and criticism.
Glynn, as an anti-Laborite and a Free-
trader, is naturally open to a suspicion of
having a more tender regard for the
foreigner than the Australian democrat.
So is his leader, Cook. So are certain
other members of the Ministry. And though
it is impossible for the Cook or any other
Ministry to hope to carry a ' Black
Labor policy through the two Houses it
is quite possible for the Ministry to per-
petrate some administrative act that will
commit this country to an at least tem-
porary abnegation of the White Australia
principle. Glynn’s statement is lawyer-
like in its vague suggestiveness, but what
else can it mean? There is only one class
of labor possible for Australian railway
construction—that of the white Aus-
tralian or European or American navvy
—therefore there can be no honest
consideration of any other class. In
one way it is a pity Glynn wasn’t
more explicit. An open declaration in
favor of indenturing black labor —for the
usual limited period—would have been
pleasing to the community—and disastrous
to Glynn, Cook, Irvine and co.

Victoria Wants an Elective Ministry
and Doesn’t Know It.
As was obvious from its inception,
McLeod's weird attempt to amalgamate the
ultra-Tories-and the Laborites in the Vic-
torian Assembly and therefrom construct a
“strong” Ministry to replace Watt and co.
fizzled out. Gas-engineer Swinburne spoke
sweetly with the loyalists and severely to
the malcontents, and got the party to pass
a resolution urging Watt to “reconstruct” ;
then McLeod allowed that his pumose had
been served and withdrew his motion, and
everything was as it was before. Watt,
meanwhile, shows no enthusiasm for recon-
structiou; he has announced that there is a.
lot of work to be done this session and that
the Ministry is “going straight ahead” —
which promises little consolation to McLeod
and co. The choicest part of the business is
the attitude of the Argus, which foolishly
imagined that there was a chance of high
Toryism ruling the roost for a while. Day
after day it sternly admonished, and still
admonishes, the alleged “weak” members of
the Ministry to resign—and they still hang
on. Agriculture Graham has intimated his
intention to “go out” at the end of the ses-
sion. “But why 'not do so at once and
assist Mr. Watt out of an awkward posi-
tion?” asks Toryism. Then there are J.
Dry Brown, Billson, and poor, tired
Weary himself —why don’t they resign and
allow “strong men” of proved administrative
canacity—like McLeod, McKetchup and
Nawman Bayles, no doubt—to run the
show? The stubborn incapacity of Min-
isters to grasp the situation and go out is
simply lamentable. Of course the stupid
Argus doesn’t see that all this is a result
of the “party” system. No matter how
much a majority of the House wishes to
dismiss the weaker members of Watt’s
team, it can’t do so without sacking the
whole lot and then putting in a combination
of two dissimilar and opposing minorities
in which event the last case of that House
would be worse than the first. But with
elective Ministries a majority of the House
would sack, say, John Weary in one simple
act without disturbing any other Minister or
wasting more than an hour of public time.
Still Wanted: A Pure Milk Supply.
Last week a witness before the Greater
Sydney Commission advocated the unifica-
tion of the 60 or so tinpot boroughs, on the
grounds that it would make it possible to
establish a municipal milk supply for city
and’ suburbs. He affirmed that a pure milk
supply was as indispensable as a pure water
supply; and the fact is indisputable. Now,
to get a pure water supply Sydney ana
suburbs had to <consolidate and establish th
Water and Sewerage Board. To have let
each municipality to provide its own dnn -
ing water would have been madness, an
it would be impossible to find anyone ou -
side a lunatic asylum mad "enough to disput
the fact. If the milk supply is to be as good
as the water, it is necessary to take it
likewise out of the hands of those wh
the business for profit only. Sydney \filk
not only neglected to establish a
Supply Board, but its separate municipali-
ties have done practically nothing

Victoria’s Board of Health.
The small-pox scare revealed what a prac-
tical joke the Vic. Board of Health is. It
is an ornate collection of municipal dogma-
tists, who meet once a fortnight or so, and
raise a crop of resolutions on matters that
have aiready been dealt with by the head
or the -Department, who is also nominally
Chairman of the Board. When there is
nothing particular to resolute about, it fills
in time discussing (say) eugenics, or lis-
tening to a . weighty discourse by someone
on the marriage laws of Kamschatka. The
small-pox scare happened a day or so after
one such meeting, and the bottom was all
out of it before the next fortnightly meeting,
so that the trouble came and went without
the Board having a look in. Dr. Robertson,
m his indecent haste to act and save his
country, had forgotten to call the trusty
band together, so when it got its periodical
opportunity it hurled indignant resolutions,
and called upon him to render an account
of his delinquency, and it then and there
resolved to hold a special meeting to discuss
the same. It duly met to receive the ac-
count ; but the very practical Robertson
blandly intimated that he really hadn’t had
time to prepare the written reply it sought.
He gave it a brief and very-much-to-the-point
verbal one, however; whereupon, after fling-
ing around some more resolutions, it re-
corded its appreciation of the prompt and
effective manner in which he had acted in
the trying circumstances. At latest accounts
it was considering whether it should re-
solve itself into a comic-opera, while John
Weary was still dreaming about the aboli-
tion of the Board as at present constituted,
and its replacement by a body of experts.

In Merrie England.
The Board of Trade (Eng.) Labor Gazette
has been making the old wheeze that “Brit-
ons Never Shall Be Slaves” look suspiciously
unreliable. The last volume of the detailed
reports upon the inquiry into the earnings
and hours of the alleged children of free-
dom in the United Kingdom, during 1906
(it seems a long time to take over the com-
pilation, but the ground covered was enor-
mous), deals with 40 separate industries —
paper, printing (etc.), pottery, brick, glass,
chemical, food, drink, tobacco and some mis-
cellaneous trades. It is shown that, for
full-time work, the average earnings of men
over the entire group of industries was a
whole 28s. 9d. per week. In the paper and
printing trades, 63.5 per cent, of the men
earned £1 10s. or more ; but in the pottery,
brick, glass and chemical trades 58.4 per
cent, earned less; in the food and tobacco
businesses, 71.8 per cent, earned less; and in
the miscellaneous sections, 65.3 per cent,
had the same joyous experience. Coming
to women workers, it is set out that, in the
food, drink and tobacco sections, nearly 38
per cent, of those working a full week earned
less than 10s., and only 18 per cent, earned
15s. or more. In the paper and printing,
pottery and chemical and miscellaneous sec-
tions about 50 per cent, of the unfettered
fortunates who drudged full time earned
10s and under 155., and between one-fourth
and one-third of the light-hearted birds of
Free (trade )dom pouched less than 10s. at
the end of an average week. In the paper
and printing trades, the average wage of a
woman on full time was 12s. 2d.; ot a gnl>
6s 4d At the arduous and unhealthy pot-
tery and chemical work, the wage ran with
the expedition of a snail to 11s. led. for
women and 7s. for girls. In the food and
tobacco businesses, lia. sd. and 6s. 6d. were
the respective doles, and miscellaneous ° dd
jobbers made 12s. 4d. and 6s. 9d. Yet the
perennial parson, who is mostly an abject
caterpillar before wealth and position, is
surprised and horrified at the deadly White
Slave traffic in England s women. and
chirrups loudly for the lash as the remedy.
Perhaps it is— if applied at the root of the
evil. „

If a Sydney importer missed his train and had to

U I ) a B' a * n .> or do any other useless job that
would save their faces in accepting a charity wage
from the Government that had made their humilia-
tion possible. The city’s demands upon the public
purse were mostly for beautifying its surroundings,
or adding to the convenience and comfort of its in-
habitants. The men outback, upon whose labor the
£>ty d upended, asked for nothing more than ordinary
facilities for getting their produce to market. To
the city dweller a park, a bridge or a suburban tram
more or less mattered little. It was merely a question of
a little delay in obtaining one more addition to the
comforts and conveniences of their surroundings. To
the man on the land a railway or an easily accessible
port means his living, and a denial entails the loss
of years of hard toil, and possibly ruin. Yet he is
always turned down in favor of the ever-increasine
demands of Million Clubs and other lunatics, who fail
to grasp the fact that the prosperity of Sydney,
their well-beloved' depends upon the prosperity of
the country that feeds it.
But, thank the gods that be, the bush-dwellers
have awakened, and the first congress of the Country
Party Association, held on July 5, was the outward
sign that their long-smouldering resentment has
burst into flame. The daily papers may scoff at
them as a lot of “disgruntled hayseeds,” but the
space they devote to the job leads one to suspect
that they are afraid that they may remain to pray
after the next general elections. “Decentralisation
and the creating of new ports north and south of
Sydney, and the connecting of these ports with the
main lines of the State,” is pasted inside the hat
of every member of the C.P.A., and when the time
comes to put candidates into the political field, the
city press will find the men on the land behind those
candidates.
The Death of William Lyne.
“Oom Bill” Lyne did not long survive the
defeat for his old electorate of the Hume.
It was the sort of thing he would feel
keenly. He could take a licking as well as
any man, but he _ never could understand a
man’s friends giving him the licking. Also
he could never understand a man standing
by while his friend was licked. Right to
the end he was the big-hearted, generous
bushman. There never was, in fact, a more
thoroughly typical Australian bushman in
the front rank of Australian public life.
It was that which kept him a good Radical:
the city’s commercialism never entered his
soul to make it mean and narrow. Tra-
ducers he had by the hundred; for the
whole importing gang was at the throat of
the vigorous man who stood and fought all
the time for a high tariff. On that ques-
tion there could be no compromise with
him. When his old Protectionist friends
formed the Fusion he declined to be a party
to it. A weaker man would have saved his
skin by pocketing his scruples and joining
one force or the other—the “Liberals” or
the Laborites. Lyne could conscientiously
bind himself to neither. He could have no
truck with a party led by a Freetrader and
kept in power by the votes of Freetraders ;
and, though the Labor platform made a
stronger appeal to him in the main, there
could be no tariff sinking with him. So,
after a strenuous life, lonely since the death
of that great leader Kingston who was
more after his own heart than any other
he had found in Australian politics, the
sick old man nominated for the Hume —the
district he had represented for over 32
years—and left it at that. The Labor
party at least showed him no opposition;
had it done the little more that it might
reasonably have done, Patten would not
have won the seat for the Liberals, and the
chances are that Hook and his team of
pettifogging meddlers would not have been
in power. But if there was no room in
either of the two parties for William
Lyne. Australia will find plenty of space in
its grateful remembrance for this bie r . useful
man, clean in spite of a hundred mean
stories to the contrary, vigorous ; n admin-
istration. ardent in patriotism, and generous
in all his impulses.
Australia may allow Agar Wynne to kick
the kangaroo off the postage-stamps, and it
may not take any savage measures when
Cook contrives a hash of the mater-
nity bonus; but it will make trouble
if the Defence business is monkeyed
with for small party purposes. Last
week work was hunsr up at the
Cockatoo Island Dock—the naval-engineering
depot taken over a while ago from the
N.S.W. Government. The yarn was that the
boilers were so far gone in the infirmities
of age that it was unsafe to use them, and
the party hacks chortled about the purchase
of a pig in a poke. Unfortunately for that
chortle, Davis. Director-General of Works,
dropped in a report to the effect that the
power-supply was poor and antiquated, and
the fact having been admitted during the ne-
gotiations. full allowance had been made for
it in fixing the purchase price. So a beauti-
ful scheme to make a bit of party capital
out of an alleged rotten bargain fell down
dead, and to excuse the hanging-up of this
part of the Defence preparations, the un-
patriotic crowd was driven back on to a
yarn which nobody will believe that work
was stopped because the Government feared
for the lives and limbs of the workmen.
Even in party-ridden England patriotism
puts the navy beyond the tricks of party,
and there should be a million ballot bricks
waiting to fall on the crowd which will do
any worse for it in Australia.
A week ago it looked as though the Chinese
Imperial Republic was about to burst.
What troops the Peking Government bad
were watching the Mongolian princes; and
the whole of the South and most of Middle
China was in arms. The “rebels” were
said to have the support of Japan, which
was alleged to be supplying officers and cash.
Yuan Shih Kai was understood to be at his
last gasp, and his departure with a carpet
bag was hourly expected. But Yuan has
always had the knack of having a good,
well-paid, thoroughly-armed and excellently-
disciplined army up his sleeve; and on this
occasion he proved more than equal to his
reputation. His well-trained, well-armed
troops moved forward with truly Chinese
deliberation, and at every battle the more
numerous Southern and Middle Kingdom
rebels were not only beaten, but routed.
Every battle seems to have resulted in a
rebel army being entirely smashed up, and
at time of writing the rebel chiefs were tele-
graphing for terms of peace. So it looks as
though the rebellion or insurrection of the
Constitutionalists is going to be stamped
out; and the betting should be about 10 to 1
that within the next six week or months
Yuan Shih Kai will proclaim himself
Emperor and silence all objectors by remov-
ing the top end of any who too openly pro-
test. Yuan is getting on in the world very
well indeed, thank you.
The straight tip of “Bake Dwyek” :
I offer no excuse for being a globe-trotter who
covers about 40,000 miles of land and water annu-
ally. I have travelled all five continents, and I
know every State in Australia from end to end, this
being my fifth extended visit. Australia has a warm
place in mj' affections, and 1 want to tell what I con-
sider its chief weakness. It is far too exclusively
British. Now, I am a Britisher myself, and my
sympathies are actively with Britain ; but I con-
sider that the British race, after having had a bet-
ter innings than any in "history, is now on the down
grade, and I fear that its most disquieting features
are being reproduced here. The Irish are the only
non-British people strongly represented in Australia,
but there is practically no inter-marriage on account
of their religion. What Australia needs is a strong
infusion of German and Scandinavian blood. Cer-
tainly there are Germans in isolated districts of
Queensland and in South Australia, but inter-marriage
is not extensive. Scandinavians, who, according to
American and Canadian experiences, make the finest
immigrants of all, are scarcely represented at all.
So far as I am aware, no attempt has been made by
Australia to obtain immigrants from anywhere but
Britain, and that is a fatal error. Australia’s ex-
clusively British character is what delays the rise of
a strong national spirit in the Commonwealth, and
Without that spirit Australia will always be weak.
My experience is that The Bulletin [honey here
extracted].... can only benefit Australia by fighting
for things Australian, and this involves fighting
against the unreasonable bias for things British. The
immediate practical thing to do is to get Australia
as extensively advertised on the continent of Europe
(and particularly in Scandinavia) as it has hitherto
been in Britain, and the result will be advantageous
from every point of view.
The mentally blind who voted against the
last Referenda, and have every day since
been squealing about the increasing cost of
looking at the sun, got an object-lesson from
Maoriland last week. They had voted down
the Referenda because the daily papers had
told them, if the proposals were carried, it
would amount to Unification, and Unification
was vaguely represented as being worse than
Beelzebub. From the Trust’s point of
view, no doubt it is. Maoriland at one time
consisted of no less than nine provincial dis-
tricts, or States, each with its own Assembly
or Council. When Maoriland got sense, ail
these were wiped out, and the country was
unified under a Supreme Parliament. It
was a clear case of Unification. The result
was that, years later, when the country
found it was afflicted with Trusts and Com-
bines, the supreme Parliament, untrammelled
by either a High Court or a half-bred Yan-
kee Constitution, passed the Commercial
Trusts Act to deal drastically with preda-
tory corporations or combinations of cor-
porations or individuals. The first gang
attacked was what was known as the Sugar
Trust, and it went down smash in less than
a week, being hit with fines that ran into
four figures and costs on the highest scale.
Last week it aopealed, and the appeal was
blown out promptly. It then asked permission
to take the case to the Privy Council, and got
it on condition that it deposited £5OO as
security for the costs of the Maoriland
Crown Law Department. Meantime the
public is protected from the rapacity of the
Trust; and if the appeal is successful, the
Unified Parliament can promptly pass a more
drastic Act —in one night, if it chooses —
and thus get over any fool-decision of the
Privy Council.
The 416th Commission of Inquiry appointed
bv the N. S. Wales Labor Government con-
tinues to snore peacefully in Sydney. It
is alleged to be finding some dream-like
remedy for Ma’s industrial ills. For weeks
and weeks and more weeks there has been
a procession of sleepy witnesses, each of
whom has been examined and cross-exam-
ined at length by one Buchanan,
representing the employing classes, and one
Connington, on behalf of the employed.
Both advocates have been flogging a dreary
procession of questions which Noah put to
the deck-hands applying for jobs on the Ark;
and the answers forthcoming have been as
those supplied by Shem, Ham and Japheth.
the aforesaid deck-hands. The chairman of
the Commission is Piddington, K.C., and.
though this paper doesn’t know what he
is drawing from the Treasury, it believes
the amount is more than eight shillings a
day. By the time the job is fifiished the
bill will be illuminating, whatever the report
may be. But don’t ask The Bulletin
when the job will be finished. Present in-
dications are that the angel Gabriel has a
good chance of being called as the last
witness.
,
The other day Melbourne Argus waxed
scornful over the allegation that ancient
Graham, the Vic. Minister for Agriculture,
had suggested an immediate expenditure of
£40,000,000 in establishing a Commonwealth
line of steamers for conveying Australian
goods to Europe. As a matter of fact,
Graham did not throw out any such reck-
less figures. He said that if Victoria could
find £40.000.000 for its own railway pur-
poses, the Federal Government could find
means to run a line of ships to Europe, and
carry goods at lower rates than Private
Enterprise. In short, Graham talked mod
erate Socialism, and the Argus held him
up to the s ridicule of its fat-lieaded believers.
It solemnly accused him of being “afflicted
with a craze against the middleman.’’ as
though it were an awful affliction. It quoted
instances of States making a clumsy, unprofit-
able start in the seavcarrying business, as
though Government incapacity for doing
good commercial things _ for the_national
benefit were proved bevond question. Whilst
thus feeding conservatism with the same old
lies, the Argus dropped in soc™ absolutely
truthful remarks upon the State s back-
wardness in providing proper harbor, pier
and wharf accommodation for big vessels,
but these sins of omission were merely in-
stanced as wrongs done to Private Enter-
prise. They were presented as final reasons
for terming poor old Graham a
Plunger’ among Ministers, with the tacit
suggestion that Premier Watt should care-
fully exclude him from a reconstructed Cab-
inet in favor of Private Enterprise’s chosen
nominee. The animosity of the Argus
comes as a well-earned compliment to
Graham. It does him proud. People who
had thought nothing about him will now
regret that he was born too lone ago to be
of much further use to the anti-Tory cause.

A plethora of pretty flappers in a “finish-

’ porcupine patrol”; an Alpine scene with
more or less real snow and more or less real
ski and more or less beautiful girls in white
sweaters or in more or less Bulgarian or
Vulgarian dresses; a glittering ball-room
scene in London, with the sort of costumes
that evoke the loud “Oh!” of awed envy
from the women, and sufficient knee show-
ing through the slashes to prevent the at-
tention of the men from wandering; a comic
butler with a fatuous yet ingratiating smile
and much zoological and historical chatter
and many costumes; a lord who pretends
that he is a riding master, and who would
probably make a better riding master than
he does a lord ; a villainous baron who sings
something as near as he can get to “Won’t
You Come to the Ball?”; an aeroplanist
who leaves his aeroolane in the umbrella
stand while he makes love to a girl; a girl
who rather likes being made love to by an

wobbling in the aerial distance : a ski-dance ;

a Scotch accent that skids a lot, and rather
frequently volplanes; a variety of Scotch
and other barbaric costumes and dances ; a
girl named Bella Peach, and a delightful,
adorable, delicious, lovely, chic, charming,
piquant French mistress (sc7iool-mistress, it
is perhaps necessary to mention ) • two very
long intervals, some fine lighting effects,
several tons of mountainous scenery, and
some cheerful music—these things make up
the entertainment presented at the Cri-
terion on Saturday evening, vyhich the cos-
tumiers, Buckley and Nunn and the Misses
Clapp had, in a moment of irresponsibility,
labelled “The Dancing Mistress.’ Also,
there was a plot, and about four authors.
"A BUTTERFLY ON THE WHEEL”
AT SYDNEY ROYAL.
Lewis Waller , K.C., and Halliwell Hobbes
try to crush the tearful little butterfly.
Mr. Jack Cannot had his traditional part,
that of a butler in a ladies’ school, who
pursues §ll _ the other characters all over
Europe, waiting only just long enough to
change his costumes. His irrelevancies and
his patter were ancient, but absurdly divert-
ing, and his imitation of the engine of a
motor-launch suggests that perhaps he
would make a better motor-launch engine
than a comedian. Frank Greene, as a vil-
lainous baron, occupied most of his time in
singing innocuous ballads in waltz time.
Mr. Leslie Holland, as the aeroplanist who
starts from Switzerland to race to England
and arrives there in evening dress to find
all the other characters already awaiting
him, had small scone for anything but the
conventional love-making of the conventional
musical comedy hero ; but even this he con-
trived to make somewhat different. Miss
Jessie Lonnen was as Scotch as this typical
English ingenue can be, and whether as the
tuckwoman or the plaided mountaineer her
careless charm was as evident as usual. Miss
Olive Godwin, besides wearing a wonderful
evening dress, romped through her part of
a flirty maiden; and though Miss Vera
Pearce had little to do except with her
eyes, she threw her glances with ease and
dexterity. Miss Blanche Browne, as the
dancing mistress, worked hard, imnarting
the last nuance of expression to every word
of her songs and every gesture of her feet,
but it seems a pity that she allows a slight
sense, of strain to mar her otherwise quite
sufficient charm. A practised vivacity is
no doubt necessary for any comic-opera
star, but her art should be of the sort that
conceals art. The success of an evening
that had many obvious successes was the
tine character acting of Miss Grace Palotta
in the part of Mile. Touchet. the French
mistress at the finishing school. (For ad-
jectival expression of opinion see above.)
Miss Palotta was in every way satisfactory;
her animation, her dramatic feeling, her
grace, her striking costumes and her man-
ner of wearing them could not have been
bettered.
. The costumes, the music, which is suffi-
ciently like the music of all other musical
plays to be recognised at sight, the lighting
effects, and the efficient and artistic stage
management and grouping of the characters,
will give “The Dancing Mistress” a long
career in easily-amused fevdney.

“The Speculators,” which followed “The
Grafters” at the Palace (Sydney) on Satur-
day night, is, like its predecessor, musical
burlesque based on nothing in particular.
Its alleged plot is even more incoherent,
and vague, and invisible to the nude eye
and absent at the roll-call; its burlesque is
mostly supplied by Moses La Blanc and
Frank back’s indiarubber collision bulk-
head, as. formerly; and its music and danc-
ing are no better nor any worse —which is
to say, they are of similar quality, or there-
abouts. Also, there was no marked differ-
ence on the opening night in the apprecia-
tion of the audience. The hob-nailed ap-
plause in the gallery was at par, and the
joyous cackle of the milliner’s apprentice
in the stalls added to the gaiety of the occa-
sion. The writer rattled his bones with the
rest after Isaiah La Blanc, Dutchy Vack
and the gifls from Amsterdam had "finished
“Annie Annhauser”; likewise when the
“Nursery Rhymes” were sung; and ditto
at the conclusion of sister La Blanc’s danc-
ing extravagance. Sydney theatregoers who
took such a fancy to “The Grafters” will
■find the same flavor in “The Speculators.”
=:- * * *
The Butterfly is still on the Squeal at
Sydney Royal. The Waller-Titheradge
melodrama has hit the great heart of the
feminine public, and thousands of women
are “just dying” to hurry along and weep
at it. Poor little crushed Peggy, who looks
so sweet in her real ermine lurs, stands and
sobs for the whole downtrodden Sex —the
Sex that is insulted and imposed on, and
faints under heavy furs, and doesn’t have
to work, ' and reads Elinor Glyn with its
feet up, while its cynical brute of a husband
goes away into town eVerv morning to drink
and joke, and doesn’t give a thought to the
patient, contriving woman at home, who
hardly knows how to make both ends of her
blouse meet. You realise what brutes men
are when you see the way Butterfly Madge
is bullied and frightened. Make that brute
of a husband take you! It will be a lesson
to him ; or, if it isn’t, it will at least cost
him money, and enable you to show the
jealous frump next door that you still have
a decent evening dress to your back.
“Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford,” which
was revived at Her Majesty’s on Saturday,
made so good an impression 12 months ago
that it isn’t yet necessary to more than
recall how the two crooks, Colonel J. Rufus
Wallingford and “Blackie” Daw, descended
upon sleepy Battlesburg and trimmed all
the boobs, but fell in love and through no
fault of their own turned Battlesburg into
the largest manufacturing town in the mid-
dle W’est —wholly and “solely through a cov-
ered carpet tack. There is no change in
that part of it, but the cast has had numer-
ous alterations, and suffers from some of
them. Beatrice Holloway, as the steno-
grapher, has a big task to play up to
Josephine Cohan, but she does it admirably.
“Andy” Dempsey, the hawtel proprietor
previously so delightfully handled bv J. II
Manning, falls away at the hands of Fred
Cambourne, who 12 months ago made a hit
as the ’bus driver —a part now taken with
less success by Ronald Bryam. Nor does
Bessie Meers, the head waitress, receive
such good treatment from Marie Avis as
she did from Margaret Dale-Owen; and
Maurice Dudley doesn’t make Blackie Daw
deal so convincingly with the boobs as Cor-
son Clark used to. On the other hand, Fred
Niblo, as Wallingford, is the same superb
company-promoter and crook: and E. P.
Bush, E. Lester and 11. 11. Wallace retain
the excellent characters they had in the
former production. Wallingford will cease
wondering “if that damn thing is any good”
on Tuesday night. On the following Satur-
day Gen6e and her dancers will float in and
supply Sydney with a new thrill.

“Her Road to Ruin” belongs to the more
subdued type of Adelphi bellowdrama. The
supply of bloodstains is strictly limited;
there is but one murder, and that murder
so uninteresting that the present N.S.W.
Government would be sure to hang the mur-
derer. The villain in the case is the nephew
of a bishop, who will believe nothing bad
of him, though the victims of his villainy in-
clude one curate, three girls, the Bishop
himself and (more or less) a newspaper
reporter. If any one thing stands out above
others in the story, it is the mountainous
collection of improbabilities. Still, as Mar-
lowdramas go, it is well up to the standard.
THE LATE ARMES BEAUMONT.
warranting neither instant death nor im-
mortality. Also the scenery is,' for the most
Part, excellent. Miss Nellie Fergussou
makes quite a graceful slide down the path
to nun, and a comfortable ’ climb back
again. Miss Alma Phillips, the heiress who
is suddenly married to the curate, and Miss
Ethel Buckley in one of the light parts, leave
little to be desired. C. R. Stanford is a
successful bishop, Cyril Mackay a wronged
curate, and Herbert Leigh supplies all the
villainy that is necessary to make the rest
of the cast feel uncomfortable for three
hours.
The Tivoli relies this week on the big
stock of new turns recently acquired and
included in the previous week’s programme,
plus the De Bruns, who have'added a few
new dances, including a caper downstairs.
The survivors of former programmes include
the Mullers, hoop spinners j the Golden
Troupe of Russian singers and dancers ; the
four rag-time Primroses, Martynne, and the
six Hoboes.
The end is not yet in sight of the local
military film, “Australia Calls,” at Spencer’s
Lyceum. The picture is doing great busi-
ness, and has already scored a “Ministerial
night.” The Kinetophone, which this wpek
includes the quarrel scene from “Julius
Caesar” and “The Musical Blacksmith,” is
proving a toothsome sauce for the before-
mentioned strong meat.

The Crystal Palace has been specialising
in Dr. Mawson’s Polar holiday. The pic-
tures, which are intensely interesting, take
over all hour to do their strut upon the
stage, and, departing, are expected to leave
behind them a substantial cheque towards
Mawson’s tucker bill.
Manager Barrington reports a rising
market at the Alhambra (Sydney) for all
vaudeville lines. A nice parcel of girl
dancers _ (Jessie Lee and Thurlite Sisters
brand) improved booking quotations during
the week, and the demand for comedians
increased. Max Martins, Joe Charleses and
Will Washingtons were specially inquired
for. Generally there was enough business
to keep the entertainment mill running full
time.
Headliners at the National (Sydney),
where “vaudeville de luxe," or "de gustibus
non est disputandubi” or some such menu-
quotation is advertised, are, as last week,
(1) the rag-time coons from U.S.A.; (2)
Peg and the Limit. A newcomer this week
is Jessie Wilton, with the kind of chorus
songs that give the gallery choir a chance
to air its bottle-o voice; and Post Mason
is also back again.
The scenic attractions of “Bella Donna,”
staged for 10 nights only at Her Majesty’s
(Melb.), are calculated to save it from neg-
lect as a talky drama with a slow, painful
plot and a mostly unreal set of characters
It is hard to estimate how much the play
loses of dramatic interest in its present per-
formance by the weakness of the acting. The
extravagantly affected mannerisms of Miss
Irene Browne’s heroine aggravate the seem-
ing foolishness of the infatuation of her hus-
band (Martin Lewis), whilst the lack of
magnetic force in her Egyptian lover. Mah-
moud (Leonard Willey), makes her subser-
vience to him equally unaccountable. To a
lesser degree the capital performance of
Julius Knight, as the London doctor who
comes along to Egypt in the second act and
prevents the villainess from completing the
poisoning of her dupe, is discounted by th >
lady’s glaringly obvious uneasiness in his
presence. A doctor who did not suspect her
of trving hard to kill her husband would
have to be half an idiot, and, presumably, it
is in order to explain his obtuseness that
Greenaway makes the local physician appear
an abnormal ass.
Miss Browne’s mannerisms of speech and
ultra-melodramatic facial expressions leave
an improbable character without a sem-
blance of possibility. Her most impassioned
speeches in the earlier acts remind one of an
affected society mamma talking to a child.
Her manner of expressing dislike for her
husband in the last act is natural enough,
but it is the same manner in which she was
previously supposed to be dissembling her
feelings. Her staccato utterances when she
gives orders to her Egyptian servant at Dr.
Isaacson’s command are absurdly artificial:
and when her tinted lover eventually dis-
cards her, she fails to attain any height or
depth of amazement and despair. Julius
Knight, as afore-mentioned, is always suc-
cessful in the part of the onnortune Dr.
Isaacson, and Leslie Victor’s impersonation
of an Egyptian servant is only a l ; ttl" too
'oily and mysterious. The novel of “Bella
Donna” may explain what sort of creaturp
Ibrahim Ahmed is. The play leaves one in
doubt as to whether he is an ordinary pro-
duct of the country or an TT i-; a b
Heep. As the husband of the foolish
lady. Martin Lewis does his worst work
at the beginning of the play and his at
the finish. Irrelevant minor characters in the
clumsy opening scene are neatly played, and
so are the minor colored characters in Egypt,
and the staging is worth a visit, anyhow.

“0.K.” among the Philistines:—
• Interesting as a curio in monologue entertainment
is the work of Dorothea Spinney. She came to Mel
bourne lately as “an interpreter of Greek Play anil
nsh Diama, but has, thusfar, restricted herself
to .three plays of Euripides, leaving her recitals of
11 to come later, if they are to come at
ail. Dorothea is a severely slim and classical ladv,
hung with white linen clothes of Grecian fashion,
which look suitable for going to bed in. Not the
™ st „ irreverent outsider would dream of calling hi r
Dolly. She elocutes fairly well in a voice which
is neither very round nor specially musical, and she
gives herself plenty of time for remembering her
lines. In fact, the lady is painfully slow.
And what are the plays of Euripides that thev
should receive this monologue “interpretation” by a
lone lady on a cold platform? Lessons, in their
original form, for students of Greek. And. of these,
the unpedantic few regret the time they spent learning
a practically useless language. (The force of their
opinion and the weight of their judgment is not
lessened by the fact that Greek scholarship creates
pedantry, on account of its rarity, and that univer-

aity “Grecians” are mostly pedantic like
aforesaid.) In their English translation the p ays are
merely unnecessary reminders of a dark age when
the art of play-mak ng was in its infancy and Z
teaching was heavily trimmed with crude supersU
tion. Considering the wealth of material at the
command of the half-dozen or so Greek dramatists*
who could drag gods, seers, embodiments of passions'
and all imaginable shapes of supernaturalism into
their plot, their plays are not even evidences of liter
ary genius as the term is now understood
Those old relics of early Grecian civilisation had
no imagination worth speaking of. Thev were just
the brainy educated individuals in a community of
ignorant, credulous citizens. Nobody knew much
when Euripides was about. There were famous sculp
tors, certainly, but these men merelv had the imitative
instinct more strongly developed than it is in their
modern disciples. . Doubtless the Greeks of old had
keener eyesight, sense of smell and sense of touch
than the oyster shopkeepers up to date. But as

Why does Dorothea Spinney go around the world
telling it that Orestes, being haunted by furies for
murdering his mother, is commanded to seek a cure
for his lunacy in a wooden image of Artemis at
Tauris? The antique merits of the plays she recites
are perceptible in one’s own reading of them but
are not made evident by her emasculated recitals of
them. Apparently she does this thing to sat’sfv her
vanity, which is mostly fed by pretentious learned
professors who sit at her feet, and call the enter-
tainment beautiful anti find some sort of satisfaction
in pretending that they have enjoyed a treat which
the soulless non-students of Euripides are incapable
of conceiving. c
AT Melbourne Olympia last week Asta
Nielsen was shown as a lady of shaky eye-
balls and unreliable promises in “The Temp-
tations of Drink.” “Out of the Storm” was
a strip of domestic drama featuring a bliz-
zard, a sick cheild and a noble bloque. The
small town of Rosazzo, in Italv. was an un-
interesting spot that, got a whole film to itself J
while the peril of being an unmitigated spin*
ster was depicted in the chief comedy item',
“Fixing Auntie Up.”

The entertainment proffered by The But-
terflies at Melbourne Majestic is distinctly
threatened with intelligence and humor. The
merit of their musical work is undeniable,
and their burlesques are calculated to throw
even an audience of churchwardens into a
merry mood. Every member of the gang is
an artist of value; three are respectively
learned in piano, fiddle and ’cello ; while two
have voices that betray considerable quality
and cultivation. Altogether, a bright and
fresh lot, who get their humorous effects
without resort to clamor or violence.

when he tries to get his laughs by produc-
ing snakes and other objects by machinery,
his laborious beer jest begins to pall and a

keeps carefully within the bounds of ambig-

• an a( ;t or s point of view the stagey little thing
is strong. Espinasse wrote it years ago and stuffed
all his young experience of theatrical devices into
the plot. The blind author has fallen in love with
his lady amanuensis, ignorant of the fact that she
was his dead brother’s girl, whose photo, he has kept
m a drawer, and that her Past coincides with the
Fast of the heroine of his forthcoming novel. A
breezy male friend discovers the lady’s identity, but
chivalrously refrains from giving her away to the
blind man, and breathes his blessing on their pro-
spective union. All the situations are stage conven-
tionalities, and everything happens for simple the-
atrical effect. It is neat, talky, stale and uncon-
vincing.
“Jo Smith” writes from Melbourne: Re the play-
let by Bernard Espinasse, performed at the Frances
Ross benefit. It-might interest The Bulletin to know
that this piece was first performed in the Richmond
Town Hall in 1893 by the Melbourne Dagonet Club.
A one-act play of my own, “Drifting,” was pro-
duced at the same time. It should be remembered
that when Espinasse wrote it, 20 years ago, he was
an inexperienced boy, and considering that he has
since attained some distinction as a playwright in
London, it is a bit rough on him that he should
be now judged (locally) on a very early and amateur-
ish effort.
Passed out at St. Bart.’s Hospital, London, Fred
W. Millis, Australian ventriloquist, aged 55, after
an operation for ari internal trouble. Born at Ade-
laide and educated at Sydney Grammar School, Millis
was intended for the medical profession, but took
to storekeeping up Clarence River way. While there
he practised ventriloquism assiduously, and qualified
for a billet with a panorama show at £1 per week.
Next he toured Australia, and thence passed to
London, where he quickly made good, and was in
constant demand at the halls, until he became
afflicted with total blindness a few years ago. Millis
was a kind-hearted fellow, who took a very active
personal interest in all charities connected with the
music-hall profession.
Adrian Stephen, whose University play made a
hit in Sydney last week, should be a credit to his
country before he is finished. He has done well all
round at his University. His play is full of wit
and humor; as a speaker, extempore or otherwise,
he can give the average middle-aged Parliamentarian
or business-man lengths and a beating ; and he is but
21. He belongs to the legal Stephen family, and is
going to the Bar.
“F.”: Dead at Melbourne on July 28, and buried
at Kew, Edward Pole, born Poole, aged about 75.
He was the “Australian Roscius” of the mid-’so’s.
As a youth he showed some dramatic talent, and
played Othello, Hamlet, and other leading characters.
He failed, however, to catch on, though his father —
a tailor in Fitzrov —spent all his earnings upon him.
Later he dropped down to small parts, and appeared
with McKean Buchanan at the oid Prince of Wales,
in Lonsdale-street. Sensibly he gave up the boards
after that, and followed the painter’s trade. At the
funeral, in the Booroondara Cemetery, but two of
the old-time men were present—Johnny Cowan, the
minstrel; and F. Hailes.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: The late H. P. Lyons
did not cross Niagara Falls on the back of Blondin
or any other man, as asserted by a score of news-
papers. That feat of Blondin’s was performed in
August, 1859, at a time when H. P. Lyons, then 19
years of age, was “in advance” for a comedy co.
formed by Fred Younge and Dominick Murray to
tour Australia and Tasmania. Lyons met Blondin
in California in 1874, and after showing that he
knew his Australia well, was engaged as manager.
Lyons toured Australia and Maoriland with the show,
but went no further. He told this writer an incident
in connection with Blondin’s first arrival in \ ictona.
The Customs demanded a heavy duty on the enor-
mous tent which the performer carried with him.
Blondin would not pay, but gave an order to a local
tdnt-maker to build another, and the original one
was warehoused.

FrJm y, M , ber .PcTm ai'pearanee as a member of
1 rank M Clark s Silk Stockings” co. at the Vic-
toria Hall, Bourke-street, Melbourne, is back again
in London. She has been dropped into the show at
the London Opera House, now a variety theatre
where she sings the coon song, “Honey, m'a Honey,”
in which she scored a success when she was 16
years younger at the London Lyric in “Little Chris-
topher Columbus.” May, who was fairly well re-
ceived, has had many matrimon ! al adventures during
recent years. At one time she was Lady Francis
Hope, with a fairly good chance of some day wear-

high-kicked it away.
Felice Lyne, the not-long-discovered prima donna

Hilda in “Rigoletto.” Later on, she will be the

Pagliacci ). She doesn’t knock her pretty voice
about in Wagnerian music.

“Macko”; I have not seen anything so pretty for
years as the ingenuous love-making of the Russians
Volinin and Schmolz in their duet dances. Rumor
has betrothed them, and, on appearances, she may be
for once truthful. They are both so young; and
while there is not such intensity of passion as we
once saw in “La Mascotte,” these pretty pirouetters
are bubbling over with the joy of life, and take the
audience into their confidence. In Strauss’s Polka
“Violette,” danced with the- gay abandon of two
cheeky sparrows, the simpffeiyy of their steps is
almost an impertinence, yet just to see him kiss her
—I want to encore the item all night.
Queenslander Carroll, the “big” moving picture-
man of the North, who is at present on a tramp
abroad, drops a line from Buffalo, N.Y. (U.S.), to
say that h s health has greatly improved since he
visited Riverview Park, Chicago. There he encoun-
tered a couple of old folks from home, billed, regard-
less of expense, as follows: “Cannibals! Man and
Woman! The Strangest People on Earth! Living
on Raw Meats Only ! Australian Savage Man ! Aus-
tralian Savage Woman!” Posters depicted a most
ferocious-looking party of black half-humans, half-
beasts, tearing sheep to pieces and devouring them in
the wool. These “w Id Australian guys” as the
intelligent locals called them, were kept in a deep
pit, presumably so that they could not escape and
devour Chicago’s flock of lambs that haven’t already
been devoured by the packs of ravenous grafters.
“St. Anton”: At no-license Masterton (M.L.) the
other day a local picture-show orchestra proposed
to delight its audience with a composition entitled
“Whistle to Me,” and duly submitted the name in
its programme copy. But the comp, was th'rsty,
and, letting his mind wander, set it as “Whisky for
Me” ; and the audience liked it that way ever so
much better.
“Satis”: The “Russian Imperial ballet” seems to
be as numerous as the Smiths. We have a small
assortment of them just now in Australia. A whole
mob is dancing at Drury Lane during a saison a la
Russe, run by guinea-a-box Beecham. Pavlova and
her troupe are kicking up behind and before at the
Palace, Shaftesbury Avenue. At the Empire
Lydia Kyasht is once again tripping it. These
“imperial” dancers should really have a little more
consideration for the poor old moody Czar. He must
be sadly in need of a little cheering up these days ;
yet his ballet seems to have deserted him by the
million.
Archbishop Mannix, the -R.C. assistant to
Archbishop Carr, of Melbourne, is men-
tioned as the next Archbishop of Dublin.
Archbishop Walsh, of that city, authority
on bimetallism, church music and other
things too numerous td mention, is totter-
ing to the tomb, and Mannix, Maynooth’s
late president, stands well with the feeble
prelate, and with the clergy, whose votes
will be submitted to Rome before the final
selection is made.
“Crystal’s” note on the moot question
whether Black Brother knew what small-
pox was:—
In the north-east of South Aus. there is a place
called Tooraniinga (“toora”=snake, and “minga”=
prickly acacia). Mater at Tooraminga was per-
manent and plentiful, and the spot had evidently
been much used as a camping-ground in bygone
days ; but at the time 1 saw it none of the aborigines
would come within cooee of it. They explained
that their aversion was due to a dreadful epidemic
which, according to tradition, seized Black Brother
there and killed him off so rapidly that few escaped.
There were plenty of skulls and thigh-bones around to
give color to the story. Amongst the local tribe
was one Peter, a very old blackfellow, whose face
was deeply pitted with what were unmistakable pock
marks. These, he explained, were caused by the
same disease, which had recurred years afterwards
in a less virulent form. I know the evidence isn’t
conclusive, but it at least suggests that small pox
was a visitor to inland Australia long before the
coming of the white man.
Moss Vale (N.S.W.) snatched what it
regards as a distinction out of the Wollon-
dilly by-election, as its “school of arts” was
used to hold a Cabinet meeting. Not only
did the Cabinet meet there, but the im-
portant business of determining the points
of the Governor’s speech was discharged.
But one other N.S.W. country town has
had what is claimed to be the still higher
distinction of housing the Executive Coun-
cil, with the Governor present. Bathurst
was the town, Loftus the Governor, and the
place the fine old Suttor house, a landmark
of the West. Loftus happened to be there
at the time, and as special business popped
no, the question was whether to drag the
Governor to the capital or have Ministers
up to a picnic. The Government of the
day had a rare stomach for picnics, so the
members trundled off at the country’s ex-
pense. Eminent lawyers at the time
doubted whether it was constitutional to
hold an Executive council outside the capi-
tal ; but no dreadful consequences followed
the outrage on centralisation.
The seafaring “Vagabond” from Lon-
don :
The newly-issued report of the Departmental Com-
mittee on Boats and Davits appointed by the British
Board of Trade doesn t seem to be of much use.
It finds that there are serious objections to new-
fangled notions of “shutes, slipways, moving plat-
forms” and similar cranky devices, and doesn’t
offer any encouragement to inventors to wrestle
out a feasible fixing of the kind. It says there are
several types of davits good enough for anything
and able to lower boats from any old height. I only
hope the committee has to be lowered one dark and
stormy night in a boat hanging from davits which
barely project over a wildly-rolling ship’s side, with
goodness knows how many yards of rope tangling
up in the purchase blocks. The committee recom-
mends, what really should be made compulsory, the
carriage of a proportion of motor lifeboats. Every
seaman admits that, such boats might be able not
only to mote themselves and their passengers out
of trouble, but also to tow off other boats and save
them from being stove in by the sea and the rolling
ship. There is a heap of evidence (and heaps more
liei drowned in many fathoms) of the helplessness
of row boats, especially when seamen who can
handle an oar are scarce, and have to be replaced
by cooks and stewards.
“Lee Shore”: It will be interesting to
hear the judicial opinion concerning the
action of the master of the schooner Tramp,
which was picked up the other day and
towed into the Manning River (N.S.W.).
At the end of June, the vessel was dismasted
near Port Stephens, and by July 5 had
drifted 100 miles off the coast. When there
was every indication that it would keep
going until the southern end of Maoriland
threw' up a barrier, a steamer hove alongside,
and the Tramp’s skipper decided to abandon
the inebriated wanderer. The faithful sea-
beast, however, promptly turned and started
to dog the crowd back towards the Austra-
lian coast. Arriving off Crowdy Head on
July 30, it was towed to an anchorage close
to where the old man and the boys had
landed from the rescuing steamer. Of course,
the desertion was quite justified, but a
Marine Court can’t always be made to see
it that way, especially when the said Marine
Court is composed of persons who are barely
qualified to conduct even a marine store.
There was the case of the steamer Port
Chalmers, which lost its tailshaft en route
to Maoriland, and started to drift away
south. It was out of the track of shipping
when a storm-worried barque, which had
been driven Polewards, took off the crew and
landed them at a M.L. port. The local
Marine Court (plenty of Court and not much
marine) was scandalised that the master
had not remained aboard with the crew to
be frozen or starved, and hung up his certi-
ficate for a long period. The verdict was re-
ceived with boiling language throughout the
whole British mercantile marine, but that
didn’t affect the Court. Only boiling oil
would have made a reasonable impression on
it.

“Snob”: Melb. City Council is tearing
down the ugly white wooden fences round
the reserves and squares in the back parts of
the city, cutting down the death-like rinus
insignis, that dreadful abomination imported
from Scandinavian cemeteries, and planting
gums, peppers and wattles in their stead.
Not content with doing well and letting it
alone, the city fathers are naming these in-
offensive parks and nlantations after them-
selves. Here is the first list: Burston Square,
levers Park, Pratt Reserve, Sir Henry
Weedon Square, Alderman Burton Reserve
and Gardiner Plantation. The cruelty to
posterity of foisting such names on the plea-
sure resorts of the future will be best under-
stood when it is stated there are still gardens
to be named after Hennessy, Benjamin,
Flegeltaub, Zevenboom and Cockbill.
The yarn of the pew-opener : '
The kindness of the Archbishop of Sydney
(Anglican) in not permitting his curates to flood
The Bulletin's waste-paper basket —at any rate, not
till they can preach a little —gives some Bulletin
interest' to the story ,of. his appointment. For a
great many years the Church of England has been
convulsed over a question of clothes to be worn by
ministers at certain times. In Sydney many worthy
clergymen, neglecting all else, have devoted their
energies to compel their brethren at two churches to
wear the same millinery as themselves. Under the
late Archbishop Smith they had no success; that
worthy man was possibly too clever, or possibly too
good a Christian, to needlessly poke up his neigh-
bors. When he died their chance came. At the
Synod for electing a new Archbishop they had a
majority. Archbishop Wright, incredible as it may
seem, was once quite an obscure worker in the vine-
yard at Manchester, but had distinguished himself
by speeches and writings as a bitter opponent of the
unpopular garmc is. The ecclesiastical wire-pullers
therefore brought his name up. The unhappy High
Church party, hopelessly outnumbered, was com-
pelled to choose between him and an utterly im-
possible person. Hence the arrival of Dr. Wright,
who, from a humble archdeacon, became at once an
Archbishop—much as if a corporal were made a
general. At first the new Archbishop talked toler-
ance, but in 18 months he had abolished the un-
popular clothes. For the rest, Dr. Wright has a leg,
a fine presence and a never-failing flow of sonorous
platitudes, given forth according to the best elocu-
tionary standards, but, unfortunately, with just a
slight provincial accent which, to people who are
really “there,” classes him among the “not quites.”
Old-fashioned sheep, who prefer Christian doctrine,
are wont to look on his sermons as windy and filling,
but not sustaining. As a shepherd he has shown a
distinct partiality to prize merinoes, and moved his
house from old Bishopcourt to the prize merinoes’
Darling Point to be “nearer his work.” A hand-
some man, a good organiser, ambitious, and vowed
to narrow Puritanism, he is a great favorite among
the worldly holies. As regards his views, he is
quite the correct Englishman. He has published one
hook, “Advice to District Visitors,” or something
such, and lays down with some distinctness the
duties of the poor to the rich. In the democratic
life of N. S. Wales he will be as useful as the bell
of his own cathedral, and as much considered.
The righteous curse of “The Under-
signed” :
Who are the immortals? There is evidently so
much doubt that 1 move for the appointment of
some responsible authority to regulate the erection
of public memorials and statues. Here in Mel-
bourne we have a most indifferent lot of bronze and
other effigies, one or two of them representing worthy
enough subjects; others who may pass; others again
who have not the slightest title; and to the last
section we are adding. On Saturday, July 26, was
unveiled a presentment of one Harry Skinner, pub-
man and sport, surely the smallest individual who
ever lived on in statuary. What mortal right has
the circle of petty “admirers” of this caterer to
foist upon present and future generations this
grotesque! The statue is the usual heroic-sized
bronze, standing upon the customary two ot three
hunks of granite, and it was in all seriousness “un-
veiled” before an admiring crowd of South Mel-
bourne and Albert Park ratepayers. Statues are
notoriously badly dressed; this one is especially so,
and in a sac suit—perhaps a copy of the very suit
this immortal wore on race days at Caulfield, where
he was wont to cast an eye over his booth to spot
the barman who nipped the marked florin. Well,
there he is, Skinner the caterer 1 And now, Bent!
There stands in a conspicuous place at Brighton
the foundation ready for a pedestal which is to
uphold the grace and dignity of Mr. Thomas Bent.
In a few weeks we shall have another solemn un-
veiling, with the usual flapdoodle of which we are
so tired concerning the things Bent did for Brighton.
This “statesman” outside the boundaries of his
borough was as nought. But “Tommy done a lot
for Brighton” ; how impossible he was in anv other
constituency was shown once in South Melbourne,
where he got 35 votes and lost his deposit. The
man was a travesty of what a statesman
should be. His clownings were a shame and a de-
gradation to the Legislature, and now we citizens are
to have our eyes offended by sight of a statue to
this embodiment of cunning ignorance. Skinner
may have had his good points; but running a pub,
serving as president of a football club, and as an
M.L.C. for a very short period, certainly give him
no claim. Surely it is time for us to have some
responsible body constituted to say who shall and
who shall not have this, one of the supreme honors
of the people, accorded him.
Concerning a town which has some reason
to shout for itself: —
lialgoorlie (W.A.) got a good municipal start
under such men as Staniforth Smith, nowadays Lieut.-
Gov. Murray’s brigadier in Papua; and when its own
virtues weren’t strong enough to keep it on the
straight financial path, Cohen’s doubts about its
future did the trick. Wherefore to every loan it
negotiated there was securely nailed a sinking fund,
with the result that, though it has electric light and
power works, markets, swimming baths, and such
like, its total net debt now is only about £4OOO.
In fact, its sinking funds have been lately getting so
far ahead of requirements that the last contribution
for a debt due in 1915 was paid in during 1912, and
it has been found that for the next five years a
contribution half the size of that hitherto made will
suffice to wipe out another debt due in 1918. The
money actually borrowed for the electric light busi-
ness, to specify one department, was only £22,500.
Things boomed at Kalgoorlie, but instead of water-
ing stock or issuing bonus shares or doing any of the
tricks that are played when Private Enterprise is at
the helm, the profit was just poured back into the
business— £83,105 of it to date. And naturally the
profit on that £83,105, which was costing nothing
in interest, allowed the council to swish off the old
debt,. until to-day there is only £2607 of it left.
And that could have been wiped out long ago if the
loan hadn’t been for a fixed term, and there was
nothing to he gained by hurrying along the sinking
fund ; so the money that might otherwise have gone
in wip : ng out the debt, and the money that under
Private Enterprise would have gone in paying per-
haps a 15 per cent, dividend on a watered £lOO,OOO
of capital, has either not been collected from the
consumers, or it has been passed over to the council
for the improvement of the city. In one recent
vear (1911) the business handed over £4250 for
this latter purpose. In three or four years there
won’t be a penny of debt on the undertak-'ng. Kal-
goorlie will then absolutely own its whole lighting
outfit, and every coin collects beyond the actual
cost of making and supplying the light and power
will be available for public purposes.
SHE'D HIT IT.
INANE PHILANTHROPIST: “Don’t you think fishing’s cruel sport?"
ISAAC WALTON: “Cruel! Here I’ve been two hours in the broiling sun, nearly ate by
flies, and ain't ’ad a bite! D—d cruel, I call it."
“Final Notice”: The other morning the
postman brought me the expected hint from
the co. that is alleged to supply gas to North
Sydney. It said, in effect, that, unless I
settled my account on or before a date
which was duly specified, the blessed co.
would “take further steps,” or execute a
few additional handsprings. It didn’t go so
far as to say it would improve the gas and
make the substance of some real use ; there
was just the plain, murky hint that there
were steps ahead —a whole flight of them—
and that they would be taken at short
notice. The words were printed on dark
blue paper; presumably it was intended as
a gentle reproach, the tint of the paper
symbolising he blue ruin to which the co.
would be reduced if I didn’t disgorge
promptly. But I duly paid the amount —
paid it calmly and without threats of any
kind. As a matter of fact, I could have paid
it ever so long ago; but I chose instead tp
make the suppliers of inferior vapor wait
for their money until the last possible in-
stant. It cheers me up to think of a gas
company biting its fjngers and kicking the
gasometer because so much money is out-
standing. That beautiful provision, too,
whereby the helpless customer deposits a
sbvereign or more with the co. as a guar-
antee that he will pay for his inferior gas,
must yield a pretty crop of interest. But
the co. gives no guarantee to the customer.
I have dreamt dreams of forming a Final
Notice League, the members of which would
regularly hold back their cash, and one day
descend on the co. in a cloud of dust, and
demand their deposits back. That other pos-
sible disaster —the storming of the Federal
Note Reserve by a party of stout bank
managers—would be an afternoon tea party
to my Great Gas War. I may say that I
would not be able to write this at all if 1
didn’t possess a good kerosene lamp. I
would not even be able to read my gas co.’s
final threats. It is a sadly absurd situation.
Imagine me at home, under a sort of flicker-
ing tomb-light, peering through spectacles at
the last blue reouest for the money I am
deliberately withholding, and incorrectly
diagnosing the thing as a draper’s circular,
or an invitation to dinner! It’s a good
thing the average gas co. isn’t a milk co.
The milkman is liable to be pursued at any
moment and bailed up for samples. And,
if the samples are not up to standard, there
is a fine and a lot of unpleasant publicity.
But, of course, it is the milkman’s own
fault. He could save all unpleasantness by
being a monopoly and delivering his short
measure of inferior goods through pipes.
John Mayes, of White Cliffs (N.S.W.),
an ancient opal-gouger, was lately shifting
some logs that banked up a big dump, when
the loose mullock slid away under his feet,
and he slithered down into an abandoned
shaft at the bottom. Then the infernal
dump started to come down after him,
slowly at first, but with a persistence that
meant business. Mayes hollered for help
and frantically tried to keep himself clear
of the cascading mullock, but the dump was
out for keeps, and before the advance guard
of the rescue party could get there, it had
the man buried up to the chest. By the
time his 30 or so mates had got their shovels
to work it had him up to the chin, and it
kept him at that for an hour, and still it
came relentlessly down —down. Once it got
a spurt on, broke through the grimed,
sweating, panting defence, and covered
Mayes right out of sight. A couple of men
jumped to the rescue and scraped and
scooped breathing space for him, what time
the other men, in the effort to keep back
that hellish dump, shovelled and heaved like
a score and a half of sappers building a
Last Ditch. For three hot hours the fight
lasted, and then the shovels got triumphantly
home on the point and the dump w*>s
counted out.

Tt isn’t really Spring,
But I love it just the same;
For a little while I’ll sing,
And, because I am not lame
With rheumatics, I will dance,
Flinging both my legs afar,
Praising gay climatic chance
With a cautious “Tra-la-la!”
It wasn’t really Love,
But I loved it just the same,
When my hair was thick above,
And I played Youth’s foolish game.
But the imitation goods
Served their purpose. (Let us dance!)
There’s no wisdom in the woods
When we’re troubled with Romance.
It isn’t really Spring,
And I’m very well aware
That some winter wind must fling
Clouds and blossom ev’rywhere.
But I simply must rejoice,
When the Earth smiles like a friend,
Though I haven’t got much voice,
And my joints are loth to bend.
It isn’t really Spring.
(Any solemn ass knows that!)
But I hear a bush bird sing,
So I think I’ll take my hat
And explore one sunny mile—
It’s not wise to go too far,
For it’s but a passing smile —
Singing softly, “Tra-la-la!”

If the Fisher Government’s Portrait Gal-
lery is to be extended inderinitelv on its
original lines the Commonwealtn a hundred
years hence will have a horribly stodgv col-
lection of forgotten politicians and figure-
heads on canvas. The bare thought of its
National Portrait Gallery in a.d. 2113 is a
nightmare. The first batch of pictures
oainted on approbation will be chosen
shortly, and now preliminary sketches are
invited of Lord Denman, J. c. Watson
Party Salmon, Albert Gould, Senator Turlev
and ex-Speaker McDonald. It is to be
hoped that tablets into the gilt frames
of the motley gathering of notabilities will
give something more than names and dates
Dim, future descendants of the present gene-
ration will want biographical details to edu-
cate them up to an understanding of the
subjects. When the Jokook lot come to be
painted in due course—not till their retire-
ment from office —it should be stated on
the frames of Deakin (alreadv under weigh)
and Joe respectively that they once fused
together, and the former went into seclusion
whilst the latter battled on and became
Prime Minister by a majority of one. And
if the Speakers and Presidents are all to be
painted in turn as the ages roll along, how
about the rpen who refused Sneakerships
and things? What about Bruce Smith’s
claim to a picture 2in. larger than that of
the man who got the job he rejected? The
Nat. Portrait Gallery seems to have been
designed as a senseless glorification of
lioffice. The Australian quick-change sys-
tem whereby one hoffice glorifies a rapid suc- N
cession of holders thereof will yield an aver-
age of about 100 Speakers and Presidents
to the century. The gallerv 0 f historical
persons will have to be divided into cen-
turies.

Melbourne possesses one “hero.” at any
rate. He was negligently supporting a
verandah post in Swanston-street the other
afternoon, when a man, hastening by, whis-
pered a hurried word or two and dashed
on. A few yards behind, on the roadway,
came a bottle-oh’s turnout, conveying the
owner and a gesticulating constable, who
were both urging the ancient prad to unac-
customed speed. As they drew 'near, the
loiterer stepped smartly on the road, grabbed
the horse by the reins, and held him. Long
before the Law could persuade him that it
wasn’t a “bolt,” the quarry—a house-
breaker —had disappeared, and the Law was
a dour and disgusted animal.

The bulk of the population of Victoria is
unrepresented by any politician in the pre-
sent Federal Parliament. What is needed
is a member for football —one who plays,
talks, eats, smokes, kicks, sleeps, argues,
dreams and spits football. He should legis-
late solely for football—propose referen-
dums, executions, fires, murders, sudden
deaths, litanies, creeds, dogmas, decrees and
epistles to the honor, advancement and glori-
fication of the. expanded bull’s-skin. Such a
person would poll about five million votes
for the Senate, and have a job lasting
through all the eternities. The State is one
oofball field; and if any Paradise exists
where the hollow plunk
of foot on ball cannot be
heard, it should be re-
served as a prohibition
a rea for all time. On
Saturday afternoons from
the Murray to the sea
there rises to the clouds
one huge, opaque cry of
“Tear ’im down !” “Plug
ther cow !” “Yar ! Who
squared yer?” No town
in the State is dead, no
mining field played out,
no settlement deserted, if
it can find 18 men to
boot a bag of wind at a
given time on a
prearranged programme.
Special trains are run
for the convenience of
the god ; extra trams and
’buses, motors, dog-carts,
shays and delivery-vans;
steamers and four-horse
gunboats; obsolete
prams, coaches and bar-
rows, and all types of
wheeled, vehicle it has
occurred to the ingenuity
of man to devise. Foot-
ballers’ unions and
wages-boards; umpires
and stewards’ logs;
strikes of timekeepers
and lock-outs of women
with more than one hat-
pin—all are within view
of people of normal eye-
sight. Elections, small-
pox, finance, collisions,
divorces, droughts stumble
into conversation now
and again ; but they fall
back in front of “Sowth’s
eharnce” on Saturday,or
Seymour’s hope of biffing
Ararat. When the day of invasion comes, it
is practically certain that nine-tenths of the
population will be surrounded in the hoofball
arena, and staryed into submission. The
other tenth will probably be away erecting
an herofc statue to somebody who was pre-
sident of last year’s premiers.
The Adelaide Tramways Trust has won a
law-case at last. It has had plenty, but,
being merely a kind of Greater Adelaide,
representing all the corporations and dis-
trict councils in the metronolitan area, it has
generally seemed to juries to be fair game
for damages., This time it had smashed up
a motor-lorry belonging to the Adelaide Cor-
poration, whereupon the two public bodies
had a willing go, out of which nobody profited
except the lawyers. The lorrymen had spilt
some tar on the tram-rails, and in the end
this was held to have prevented the car
brakes from acting quickly enough. But the
•Case which really makes lawyers’ mouths
water is about to begin. The firm of Teas-
dale-Smith and Timms, which laid down the
trams, has a disputed bill, said to be about
£30,000, for extras of various sorts, involv-
ing over a hundred distinct items, each of
which has to be proved or disproved separ-
ately. On a preliminary _ canter, it was
mentioned in court, with a kind of rapturous
despair, that a small army of typists had
been at work oxt the documents in the case
for and had made hardly any impres-
sion on the mass.
The Baptist Chapel in Albert-street, East
xMelbourne, where the ' Rev. Isaac New
preached and prayed in the ’so’s, and
where he was succeeded by Charles Clark,
who won fame as a lecturer afterwards, has
been demolished. A hospital, to be run on
modern lines, has taken its place. The
change seems to conform to the spirit of the
time, somehow.

“Signor Trowsalini”: The Balkan Tur-
key-trot recalls that about the ninth cen-
tury, when the Bulgarians were changing
from Paganism to Christianity, they were
much harassed in mind about the proper
clothing of their women’s legs, and they
asked the Pope to solve the worrisome
problem. He solved it this way:—
Whether your women wear trousers instead of
skirts is of no moment to me; what I am concerned
with is faith and good works. Your customs are
not those of other Christians. Your women wear
trousers, and you fear that that may be accounted
to you for a sin ; for you know that in our Books it
is written that trousers were not ordained for
women, but for men. Hence you have thought it
your duty to consult me. Do not be anxious in this
matter. Do as you are accustomed. Preserve your
ancient customs, or adopt ours, since in some degree
you become other men in becoming Christians. After
all, whether you and your women preserve or aban-
don trousers," it will not help you one jot towards
salvation, nor increase your holiness.
In other words, the clothes don’t make the
Christian. This is, of course, only the view
of a Pope—and a fairly long-range Pope at
that. Still, I ask The Bulletin (with
awe at my own blasphemous temerity) if it
doesn’t look as sane a view as that of some
of our good missioning friends, who will in-
sist on presenting converted Binghi with a
shirt which he wears on his legs, and trou-
sers which he ties around his neck, not to
mention a hat in which he tries to boil yams?
The cheerful soul who would “sooner have
small-pox than be vaccinated,” had a bad
time last week. Four of him, in each case
the only unvaccinated person in the house,
were stricken in three days. What view
the cheerful soul takes of it now
has not yet been made public. Another
joke was provided by the man who made a
fiery speecli at an anti-vaccination meeting,
and when he got home found that a house
close to his own was infected. Thereupon
all the anti oozed out of him, and there was
another arm jabbed very early next morn
ing.
Mauritius is a
useful little con-
venience. Herbert
Henniker Heaton,
son of “Penny
Post’’ John, who be-
comes Assistant
Colonial Secretary
there, is not the
only Australian or
Australianised offi-
cial whom the little
handful of people
have had to take
at the Crown’s bid-
ding. The island
is looked on as a good
training ground. A.
H. Gordon, who
steamed around here
as High Commissioner
of the Western Pacific,
graduated, through
Mauritius, and
George Bowen, who
was Governor in Vic-
toria and Queensland,
picked up something
worth knowing in the
Frenchified settle-
ment. Henry Barkly,
also, after being Gov-
ernor of Tasmania
and Victoria, was
dropped ; for a while
into Mauritius, but
that was because no-
thing else could be
done with him just
then. The stepping-
stone may perhaps yet lead, 'if the
Labor party continues to swallow its pledges
to abolish the office, to young Herbert Ilen-
niker riding out behind postilions to Cran-
brook, with a copy of the Evening News
under his arm. At any rate, he ought to do
something for the Evening News ; for his
mother was a Bennett, and her share in the
profits allowed the young man to enter the
“aristocratic” service.
“Y”: The Australasian says the motto
of Henry Willis, late Speaker of N. S.
Wales, was “Stand off the grass.” Not so!
He never looked on himself as grass. “Nemo
me impune lacessit,” he has been heard to
murmur, or, roughly Englished, “If you hit
me, I’ll hit you.” Which brings me up to
the point: Is “Stand off the grass” English
or is it good Australian? I think it is Aus-
tralian. The first time I find it used was
in connection with the present Wynyard
Square, at a time when it was the muster-
ing ground of the old barracks. There were
a few grassy borders, and, as people used to
flock in to see the drills, Colonel Despard,
then in command, put up notices: “Stand off
the grass.” So much was his Order resented
that he became known through the city as
“Stand off the grass.” This Despard, by
the way, was the son of a captain who had
joined a smothered conspiracy to get rid of
the dreadful old King George lll—and
“Sassiety” never forgot it.

Because young Bertie drank delight
Of battle with his beers,
And looked, on wine and lips when red,
Each croaker wagged a pious head,
And entertained grave fears.
They reckoned Bert a hopeless case ;
Then heard with blank amaze
That he, who used to smoke, drink, sup,
And go the pace, had taken up
The nature study craze!
And yet ’twas true. Bert studies snakes
And lizards now, and knows
Where may be seen a splendid pair
Of wallabies —they have their lair
On Kitty’s silken hose!

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“F.II.”: After all, the 3*f earthworm, it
seems, is a godsend to Australia. Even the imported
earthworm, which “continually drives back and
starves out” the native in settled districts, does his
share in nitrifying the soil. By dragging vegetables
into his burrow, he fertilises Australia, and assists
in drought-prevention by making the soil better able
to hold water. These facts have been made avail-
able by the Victorian Government, in the Julj'
Journal of Agriculture. The worm-article in
question, though in general full of comfort, makes
one allegation of quite a disturbing nature. It is
that Gippsland is infested, to its benefit, by a large
earthworm, specimens of which have been found
measuring 86in. in length and 2Rn. around the
waist. “Their burrows,” according to the worm ex-
pert, “are very long and twisted, and the animal
produces a peculiar gurgling noise as it moves about
in them.” The giant earthworm, one learns, has
nothing worth mentioning in his brain-box. But it
seems a good thing for the beer-biters of Gippsland
that he has brains enough to make a practice of
staying in his burrow. After 20 drinks at the Farm-
ers’ Legs, it would be a nasty midnight experience
to meet him (7ft. 2in. of him) out with a bunch of
his mates. If 150,000 of well-organised Gippsland
worms would go out to meet an invader, what a
time that invader would have!
: If the evidence produced bv
ar 00 6/2/ 13) has failed to convince
“Souter Johnnie” (B. 10/7/T3) of the efficacy of
Morrissey’s snake-bite antidote, perhaps the following
undoubted facts might help to shake Johnnie’s scep-
ticism. On and about the Northern Rivers (N.S.W.)
there are, at the present time, at least half a dozen
persons who have been cured of snake-bite by
Morrissey. One of these, a boy of 12, was in a state
of collapse from two bites of a huge tiger-
snake—a species admitted by “Souter J.” to be
somewhat on the venomous side—before the appli-
cation of the cure. At Lismore, whilst giving an
exhibition with a sizeable death-adder, which
he customarily housed within his shirt, Morrissev
was h.mself bitten on the lip. In such a case, the
only available place for a ligature would have been
around the neck, and this might not have been good
or Morrissey’s wind. He, therefore, trusted solelv
o Ins own antidote, and, although much affected by
the venom, recovered. Three fowls and a dog, sub-
sequently bitten by the same reptile, died almost
immediately. Morrissey makes a standing offer to
divulge his business to any Government, Board of
Health, or Medical Board for a consideration, and
he is also open to back its effectiveness, with him-
self as the subject for trial, against all-comers of
the sixth-day creation—the cobra of India included.
How much more can a man do to get a scientific
inquiry ? Does anybody expect him to offer to be
bitten by elephants, sword-fish, hippopotami, lions,
sharks, devil fish, dogs and mining speculators?
Melbourne Herald lately had an informa-
tive little article on place names in the Weary State.
Two original names are the invention of surveyor G.
W. Wilmot, who plotted the Mallee district where
the townships of Willaura and Ilelendoite now are.
He wanted names for these districts, and, bethinking
himself of his lady friends, mused “Will Laura or
Helen do it?” An “e” was added to the latter,
and they stand as they are. Ballarat is alleged to be
Irish, from the hut of James Curtis, a shepherd
thereabouts in the pre-gold days—Ballagh hut, the
hut on the main road—thence Ballahut, clipped or
smoothed into Ballarat. Some, however, say the word
is native, and means “camping-place.” This seems
improbable, for almost every place was Binghi's
camping-place when he wanted to camp. As well
call a town in England Beer Place, because beer is
sold there, as if it wasn’t sold anywhere else. War-
renheip is the name of a hill—“emu feathers”—-in
the district. The obvious Swan Hill was so named
in 36 by Minor Mitchell. Lillydale—always so spelt
by the Age —is allegedly called after Clayworks’ song
of that name, then popular; but the Argus always
spells the name Lilydale, after Lily de Castella, of
St. Hubert’s vineyard, a few miles farther out. Ben-
digo was sponsored by a boxing shepherd, who had
been nicknamed after the famous Yiddish bruiser,
Abednego. Captain Bull rechristened it Sandhurst’
after the English military college, but a
plebiscite in 'B7 restored the old name. Port Fairy
got its monniker in ’27 from the barque Fairy,
Captain Wishart, which sheltered there in a gale.
The well-named Walhalla or Valhalla, which is
high enough to suggest Heaven, was so branded by
John Johnson, jun., chairman of claim seven at
Stringer’s Creek. Gippsland got its name from
N.S.W.’s Governor Gipps. Count Strezlecki, who him-
self stood sponsor for a still-thriving mining town,
did the christening act. There should, by the way, be
only one “e” in the name. The Austrian Count
was properly Strzlecki. Yarra-yarra is “ever-
flowing” ; Yan Yean was one of the chiefs who
“signed” the Batman treaty; Jika-jika another.
Bungaree, an aboriginal State Fighter, was the last
chief of the Sydney tribe. So far no one
has touched more than the fringe of an attractive
subject. 'Whence, for instance, came Toorak,
Prahran, Footscray, and what do they mean?
THE POT AND THE KETTLE.
If the police of North Sydney are so overworked
that they have not time to recover goods stolen by
the very many burglaries which have been com-
mitted, which, I take it, is the first duty of a
policeman, why are they taken from their proper
vocations to watch motor-cars and motor-bikes, with
a view to taking their number on passing the speed
limit ?—Correspondent in. Sydney daily.
MOTOR HOG : " He ought to be ashamed of
himself wasting his time like that instead
of safeguarding people's property.”
From the King Country (M.L.) :
A cocky over here was complaining to the Roads
Department about the state of his road of access,
and wanted it fixed up. The Department diun’t Know
much about the track, and had no officer handy to
report on it; so it wrote to the cocky, asking him
to say just how bad the thing was. The reply ran
this way: “In reply to yours, the road I have been
complaining about has got so infernal bad that I
have now got to lead my dog along it.”
HER CERTIFICATE
MRS. JUMBUCK : “I hear you got married yesterday, Tilly. By a clergyman?"
T ILLY: “ No, by nulla nulla I Look at the lump.
“Congolley”: Hard luck is what I called
it, but you ought to have heard Scotty’s interpre-
tation. He was sitting with a look of intense suffer-
ing on his dial when a pal ambled up and nodded
invitingly towards the pub. Scotty rose, looking as
sour as the Devil on Ash Sunday. Knowing he was
“stiff,” we thought he should, at least, have looked
pleased. Presently he came out and explained: “1
was as dry as a bone all the morning,” he grizzled,
“and at last I went and had a big swig of water.
I’d hardly put the billy down, when, strike me dead,
along comes Snuffler and says, ‘Come up and ’ave a
pint.’ ” The rest of his remarks were put out by
the fire brigade.
“G.R.N.”: “J. 0.8.” (B. 10/7/’l3) says
the naming of Garden Island, in Sydney Harbor, is
“lost in mystery.” “Historical Records” (Vol. vi.,
page 169) leaves the reason for the name in no
doubt. When Phillip arrived in Port Jackson with
the first fleet, it was foreseen that one of the party's
most serious difficulties would be the food
supply, and every officer was at once
given an allotment, so that he might
grow his own vegetables. The two men-
of-war that were to remain on the station
were also allowed each a plot for a
cabbage garden. The Supply was given
a lot on Dawes Point, and the Sirius was
given Garden Island. When the Sirius
was ordered to the Cape for food supplies
at the end of 1788, a member of the
crew was left behind to look after this
ship’s cabbagery. The following entry
in the Sirius's log-book settles the date
of the christening of the island: —Febru-
ary 11th, 1788. Sent an officer and
party of men to the Garden Island to clear
it for a garden for the ship’s company.”
After the Sirius left, the crew of ' the
Lady Nelson cultivated the patch, and the
island also began to be used for other naval pur-
poses. Another interesting fact in connection with
the speck is that the first poultry farm in Australia
was established on it by Governor Hunter and placed
under the care of Mrs. Winch.
“Bulloak” : When William, of Tree Fern,
made up to Kate Ryan, the moon was bright and the
weather was feeling good. He escorted her home
over the two-mile road, and never a word said he
but, “It’s a bonzer night for ’possums, Kate.” Next
night he met her again and poured the same remark
into her shell-like ear. This went on for a week
and Kate bore it patiently in the belief that when
the moon waned and darkness was upon the earth
and the sins thereof, William would be more ex-
plicit. So one dark night she encouraged him all
she could, but without making her bashful lover
loosen his tongue until the journey home was nearly
completed. Then he blurted it out. “Kate,” he
said, “er” “Yes, William,” she murmured.
“Er —a bloke wouldn’t have a dorg’s chamce with
the ’possums to-night!” That settled Bill.
“Billy T.” : It had been a rousing tight
from the shake right to the dead-finish in round 18.
Micko was down twice for nine seconds before the
fifth round was finished. In the seventh he began
to revive, and then it was Ponny’s turn to touch
wood. Ponny examined the cracks in the flooring
five times in rapid succession; then a happy cross
reached Micko and so sickened him that for two
rounds his energies were spent in pedestrianism.
Three fairly even, ding-dong rounds followed, and
both lads sustained grievous facial derangements. It
was Micko’s luck to finish Ponny with a solid body
punch in the 18th, and he came out a sad and sorely
man-handled conqueror. They assisted him to the
bathroom. Ardent admirers flocked round him. A
big bull-butcher who had taken 3 to 1 about it was
heartiest in appreciation. “It was a great fight,
lad —a lovely fight!’’ he said. “Oh, yaas,” Micko
admitted, holding down an eye that threatened to
assume the dimensions of a football, and with the
other surveying his disarranged countenance in a
hand-mirror ; “’twas a good enough fight. But, yeh
see, me sister died this mornin’, and / didn’t enjoy
it a bit.”
PILING ON THE AGONY.
CONVIT 99: " Could yer keep one down? ”
A MATTER OF SOUR BULLS AND THE GRAPES
OF FORTUNE.
[FOR TH EBULLETIN.]
It is a sad and solemn fact,
As those who know' her ways agree,
That Fortune has her cards all stacked
Before she deals to you and me ;
Her glance is fair, her eyes are sweet,
But the old party is a cheat.
For instance, Jane and I went out
One evening to the Bondi sands.
We strolled a little while about,
And I was fain to hold her hands.
I do not like her over-much,
But found some pleasure in the t ich.
I think her eyes were rather fine,
But that was all the charm she wore ;
Her contour had no single line,
Viewed from behind her or before,
Likely to hold my roving eye
Or twist my bosom to one sigh.
We caught the tram at half-past eight
(With Lucy I had stayed till ten),
I took her home and did not wait,
But wandered forth to beer with men ;
For I was satisfied that Jane
Would never lure me out again.
Now Lucy had a mighty charm ;
The simple roundness of her waist
Fitted the curving of my arm,
And both ner lips were good to taste,
While an especial sort of prize
Lurked in the corners of her eyes.
I loved her very much indeed,
And frequently would tell her so ;
Our courtship went along with speed.
It seemed that no one had a show
To win her young and tender heart,
And break our pleasantness apart
Till that confounded uncle died—
Jane’s uncle—with his herd of sheep,
Or flock of cows, on pastures wide
All left by will for Jane to keep.
And then, of course, I had to see
Whether the girl would marry me.
I asked her on my bended knees
In such a fine and knightly style.
1 said: “Dear maiden, will you please
Consider love like mine worth while?”
And when she spoke a tender “No,”
My friends remarked, “We told you so.”
And so I thought the wealth could go—
I did not want her mob of bulls ;
She should not have a second show.
I left her to the other fools,
And stalking forth in all my pride
Asked Lucy to become my bride.
The maid declined without ado.
She said that she bad just arranged
With one nice gentleman she knew
To have her name and status changed.
She recommended me to Jane,
Who owned some bulls, though she was plain.
And that is why I married Kate,
The nicest girl of all the three,
Who, though I sought her somewhat late,
Was always very fond of me;
And Kate, though very far from plain,
Was really wealthier than Jane.
And this is how old Fortune plays
Her mad and foolish wedding pranks,
And mixes up a lover’s praise
V ith soulless talk of bulls and banks ;
For all her careless make-believe
Some card is always up her sleeve.

AMAZING HAIR GROWTH.
WOMAN’S HAIR REACHES TO HER
FEET.
Astonishing Results from World-wide
Tests of Possibilities of Hair Growth.
London, May 9. —The publication of the
results of wliat is doubtless the most exten-
sive series of tests ever conducted for deter-
mining the possibilities of hair growth, shows
beyond doubt that it is at last possible for
any man or woman, whether afflicted with
dandruff, grey hair, falling hair, or even
baldness, to secure a strong, luxuriant
growth of glossy hair of almost any length
desired. In making these tests, which num-
bered many thousands, and extended over a
period of more than two years, a lotion or
tonic was used consisting of 3oz. Bay Rum,
loz. Lavona de Composee, and 5 dram Men-
thol Crystals; this being rubbed briskly into
the scalp twice a day. The results were
simply astonishing. Dandruff, scalp itching,
and falling hair all stopped in from one to
three applications; grey hair gradually as-
sumed its natural color, new hair was grown
on heads that had been bald for years, and
in countless instances hair increased from
one to two feet in length, one lady reporting
that her hair reached to her feet, having
grown thirty inches in less than two years.
Averaging the whole series' of tests, the num-
ber who reported unsatisfactory results was
only nine to the thousand, or less than one
per cent. While any chemist can readily
prepare this tonic from his stock of standard
pharmaceutical products, it is interesting to
note that, owing to the frequency with
which they are asked to put it up, most
chemists now have it prepared by a well-
known London firm of manufacturing
chemists, and keep it in stock ready for im-
mediate delivery under the name of Lavona
Hair Tonic. In view of the remarkable
proved merit of this article, every man and
woman who is suffering from any form of
hair or scalp trouble, as well as those who
desire to retain and enhance the natural
beauty of their hair, should at once get a
bottle of Lavona Hair Tonic, and give it a
thorough trial. You will be astonished and
delighted at the result.*
“Catamain”: “Souter Johnnie” (B.
10/7/T3) discredits Morrissey’s snake-bite antidote.
There are a couple of reasons why it has not been
heard of so much lately. One is that a
Mullumbimby (Tweed River) firm has patented the
remedy, so that the crowd which had worked with
Morrissey, and had got hold of his remedy, has been
squeezed out, and has left off giving exhibitions.
The other reason is that Morrissey is ill, and that
Rookwood Benevolent Asylum authorit'es don’t en-
courage demonstrations with death-adders on their
premises.
“Lagani Namo” jettisons some literary
cargo from Papua: One of the curses of the Posst'
sion is the multiplicity of languages or dialects.
Don’t know how many there are, but I reckon that
each of the 400 known villages has one to its
own chin. Frequently, in a court case, three native
interpreters have to be employed in order that the
complications may not be overlooked. I g've you
my word they never are. Motuau (Port Moresby
yabber) promises to become the official lack of taci-
turnity. Missionaries have made some efforts to
teach English to our savage brother, with results
that call for no remarks likely to preserve the
peace. After several years at a mission school, under
the tuition of the white shepherd, the cannibal has
been known to learn, “Yes, sir” ; “No, sir” ; “C-a-t,
cat.” Even the colored teachers (Samoans, Raraton-
gans, etc.) at the out-stations serve out this sort of
hash: “My wife’s love to you very big strong.
You very pretty nice man.” Further, each village
and, sometimes, each section of a village has cus-
toms as different as the dialects. One or two: A
boy, when smitten with girl-fever, procures the big-
gest green betel nut available (the betel nut is
about the size and shape of a small hen egg), carves
his most cherished motifs on it and sends it to
the chosen damsel. If she reciprocates his views,
she eats the kernel and displays the husk when next
she meets the donor. The “boys” do not mind how
affable the girls were before they were taken to
wife; but deceived husbands get fatally busy on
co-re. with a stone club or a tomahawk —unless
co-re. purchases the lady. Some Papuans are very
considerably married. I met one gay old chief in
the Purari with 17 wives. Some have more; pro-
bably it serves them right. In the delta, when a
man kills another, he, in thanksgiving, goes up to
the dubu (men’s assembly) with a flaring torch.
This he will suddenly throw away ; then anyone who
wishes can go and make love to his wife. Which
shows an uncommonly friendly spirit.
“Maire”: Henare Maori need not go to
the bottom when the inventive mind class is called
up. I’ve taken out a patent for his cow-locating
scheme. Up in north M.L., where the average small
cocky puts his trust in Providence until he can
afford a cheap fence (after which he wouldn't trust
P. with anything on hoofs), the goddess has a
habit of lying down in some secluded spot to in-
dulge in the American habit of cud-chewing.
Although the horned lady generally has a bell
attached to her necklace, it is, on those occasions,
silenced. I was raging through the scrub one even-
ing when I met Henare, and explained the trouble.
“Aw, eripes,” he said, “that te easy one. Next
time you turn te cow out, grease te horns with
stinkin’ fat. Te werry stinkin’ all te petter.
Orright. Te blowfly come roun’ an’ settle on te
cow's head, and te cow shake te head like hell.
Then te bell ring.”
GOOD BUSINESS.
THE VISITOR: "And haf you done goot peesi-
ness, Solomon?"
SOLOMON: "Veil, nodings to complain about.
Enough to keep the fire preegade avake of
nights. ”
THE ONLY EXPLANATION.
BLUEGUM BILL (staggered): "Why, you ain't dead at all!"
LOCAL PREACHER: "My good friend, what made you think I was dead?"
B. B.: "Why, I thort yer must be, after hearin' a bloke up the road say in’ wot a nice,
decent sort o' feller yer was."
“Flinderino” : In “A Sydney-side Saxon,”
by Rolf Boldrewood, there is a yarn about two un-
clean shepherds, Tom and Dick, who returned to
their hut one evening and found some writing in
chalk on the hut door. Neither of them could read,
and, thinking the writing was an important message,
they took the door off its hinges and carried it some
miles to the homestead, where the boss read, to their
disgust:—
Tom and Dick, of Yalco Green,
The dirtiest pair that ever was seen.
In Cairns, three years ago, I visited a one-time short-
story writer named Bell, and he showed me a book
of camp-fire yarns that he had published long ago. In
it I found an illustrated story about another “dirtiest
pair that ever was seen.” I told Bell that I had
read that yarn before, but he claimed it as his own
manufacture, and said Brisbane Figaro had printed
it first. Now I have just read “On the Wool Track,”
by C. E. W. Bean, and find a story of one Slimy Sam,
and the same old writing on the door, only this time
the inscription was —
Slimy Sam, of Mumblebone,
Was the dirtiest beggar ever known.
There are many Australian books I have not read yet,
and I’m wondering how many other people have car-
ried that old door five miles to the nearest scholar.
“Navvie” : Re the homing instinct of the
horse (B. 3/7/’l3). I knew a nag that was bought
by the S.A. Government from a small station near
Strathalbyn, and sent out to a survey camp in the
Pinnaroo country. He was in camp about a year,
when he broke away in hobbles during a thunder-
storm, and arrived back at his old home three days
afterwards. That meant a flight (in hobbles) of
about 120 miles, and he must have swum the Mur-
ray (still in hobbles) to do it. Evidently water was
no trouble to him, as he was afterwards shipped to
Port Lincoln, per the steamer Investigator, which
grounded up Wallaroo way. The stock were put over-
board, and all, with the exception of this old warrior
and his mate, made shorewards. These two steered
a course for Port Adelaide, and had to be rounded
up with a dinghy. His last survey job happened on
Kangaroo Island. There the old longing for home
must have come over him again, as he broke away
and struck out for the mainland. The lightkeepers
at Cape Willoughby sighted him doing eight knots
across Backstairs Passage; but as he has not yet been
reported by Cape Jervis light, and it’s two years
since he left, it’s a fair thing to say he was drowned.
“Catamain” : Among the Richmond River
(N.S.W.) blacks the man-making ceremony didn’t
deprive the newly-fledged warrior of any privileges,
but admitted him to full rights of citizenship in
every way. Until he was made a man he could not
marry, take part in a corroboree, or eat kangaroo,
carpet-snake, codfish, porcupine, or kobbi (species
of native bee honey). On one occasion I was
enabled to be present at the ceremony. When the
women had been sent out of sight and hearing, the
bucks formed a ring round the principal actors. A
boy being stripped, two bucks got hold of him, one
on each side, and with one hand held his arms
extended, and with the other, pressed against the
top of his chest in such a manner as to prevent him
moving. The operator then cut slits across the
youth’s chest with a sharpened stone, at the same
time making a “thithithith” sound, evidently sup-
posed to represent a cry of pain suppressed by
thrusting the tongue between chattering teeth. Then
he gashed a few slits in the upper arms, at each
cut giving a gasping “ugh.’’ These were the only
sounds uttered the whole time, the boy and all the
bucks being as silent and still as statues. The boy
was then led forward to the fire, and ashes were
thrown into his wounds. After all the eligibles had
been treated like that, the whole crowd sat down

tion to the previously-prohibited articles of diet.
By the way, among the same blacks the gins didn’t
lose any teeth at marriage, but, instead, were pre-
sented with a wedding ring in the form of a strand
of hair tied round the little finger close to the
hand. In a comparatively short time this com-
pletely severed the finger and left a stump with the
skin drawn over the end in approved surgical
fashion.
“Silas Snell”: Witnessed an entertaining
hubbub in our train from “Sout’ Melbin’' the other
evening. The platform at Flinders-street had just
been reached. Two men stepped briskly aboard for
the return journey, and, making for the same cor-
ner, collided and rebounded. One sat in the
cuspidore, the other knocked his occiput with some
violence against the corner of the high seat. In-
stantly words began to flow ; then they flew. “Where
the warmth are you goin’, you bun-footed, hen-faced
blitherer?” “Can’t you see what you’re at, you
blighter ?’’ They scrambled for the corner again.
Blitherer just got it. Blighter trod on his feet.
“Excuse me—my seat!” he said, with the air of a
man meditating murder. “Not much!” responded
Blitherer. “Are you going to shift?” “Not an
inch! Take the rest of the train —you’re welcome.”
Blighter seized Blitherer by the head, sudden-jerked
him out of the corner, and dumped his own carcase
into it. Blitherer was justly indignant. From his
place on the floor he took Blighter by the left leg,
and smartly dashed him among the cigarette butts.
The pair compared holes, and tumbled about a bit
for 30 seconds, fighting for the corner. Blighter
got back, but sadly dishevelled, and with a second-
hand cigar in his left ear. Blitherer fastened on
Blighter’s head, and, pulling him off, resumed pos-
session. Blighter returned to the attack. Blitherer
clung to the woodwork, and hung on. “My seat!”'
said Blighter. “Yeraliar!” said Blitherer. No
blows were struck, but garments were torn, and
collar-studs went missing. Blighter’s hat was
trodden out of recognition, all the buttons were off
Blitherer’s vest, and two-thirds of his shirt was
flowing free. A porter stepped aboard. “My seat!”
reported Blighter breathlessly. “’S a lie!” retorted
Blitherer, “’s my seat. I got here first.” The porter
was unmoved. He merely barked: “This carriage
not goin’!”
“Gouger”: One of the most depressing
jobs I have undertaken was on the Russell (N.Q ).
A fall of stone buried an old fellow, and we got
him out with a broken leg. It was his lucky day.
While a stretcher was being made, an old hand split
up a kerosene case, constructed splints and set the
leg. It happened to be a clean break. Then nine
of us set about carrying the patient to Herberton,
spell about, one man humping the tucker. The hos-
pital was over 40 miles away, and the track lay
through scrub, down ravines and up the sides of
precipitous mountains. The first night we camped
half-way, squatting down to wait for the light of
day to show the track. Around the old cove on the
stretcher we wrapped a tent-fly, but all we had for
our own covering was on our bodies—-a flannel shirt,
old dungarees and sodden boots. All day it had
rained, and all that night the deluge went on sul-
lenly and without ceasing. At the first streak of
dawn we went on again, stumbling, dispirited and
with blood squelching in cur boots as a result of
the attentions of myriads of accursed leeches. It
was dusk when we reached Herberton, and, although
we were deadbeat with fatigue, we made the few
bob we had between us get into circulation to
brighten things up. Herberton reckoned things were
illuminated considerably. The doctor said the broken
leg was set as well as he could have done it himself.
And he is not the first expert by a mile who has
had occasion to praise the quick-and-ready surgery
of the bush.

BACK O’ LILYDALE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is a path along a fence,
And scrub on either side—
Dogwood and messmate, green and dense,
Where all the wild things hide.
And on this path the lizards glide
Across the sun-barred clay,
And over all that green hillside
The boisterous breezes play.
Ten miles bad: o’ Lilydale,
And forty miles away.
Between the pathway and the skies
The dogwood branches spread,
And curtain from my dreaming eyes
The path that lies ahead,
And yet I see the old homestead
(For dreaming-sight is keen)
And the ploughed paddocks, fresh and red,
The hillside grassland green.
Ten miles back o’ Lilydale
And forty miles between.
Lilydale—and ten miles back.
A weary road and long,
And, at the last, a narrow track
Beneath the currajong,
And, here, the echo of a song
Out of a bygone year—
A whisp’ring voice that drifts along
Where once it rang so clear.
Ten miles back o’ Lilydale.
And forty miles from here.

Apropos the appointment of Job Sheldon,

that of Ijsher of the Black Rod, was the

“Cove”: Principal Gartlan has been re-
stored to Riverview ; it was a mistake ever
to have sent him away to the uncongenial
charge of the Jesuit Church at Hawthorn
(.Vic.,). Irue, the more eminent Prior Keat-
ing, a deeply lamented gentleman, replaced
mm, but it meant a break in the curriculum.
tv . c , a . n never mention Riverview without
thinking of dear little old Father Dalton, the
founder, hobbling round with the two sticks
he called his ponies. Dalton’s first coup was
the founding of the towering St. Ignatius’s,
on Richmond Hill, Melbourne. Then he had
a hand in the Xavier College. I remember
400 sovereigns being given him. “What will
I do with this.” says he. “Mother must
have it. And Mother put it into River-

in the Channel Islands recently, aged
Herbert Heath, who was a familiar
?u gure oS Bnsbane 25 years ago. After more
than 20 years at sea, he decided, when a
master mariner of 40 odd, to qualify as a
pilot for the next world, and entered Moore
College, Sydney, to be trained as an Angli-
can parson. He was a couple of years at
St. Andrew s Cathedral, Sydney, in the ’7o’s,
under old Dean Cowper, who thought highly
ot him ; then he went to Queensland, where
he sky-piloted at Mackay, Toowong, Kan-
garoo Point, and elsewhere, finally becom-
es a canon at Brisbane. Two Bishops of
Brisbane, Hale and Webber, had a great
opinion of his business abilities— and Web-
ber, at any rate, had a keen scent when any
question of money was in the air. Heath
left Australia more than 20 years ago, and
passed the rest of his days in Jersey, close
to the sea he loved.
. A connection of Melba’s is telling of an in-
e^ t 1 con cussed the equanimity of the
W orld s Greatest Singer, and left her mut-
fiercely for a whole calendar month
I here had been a “function,” and a looming
suburbanite and his simple spouse were pre-
sented to the formidable lady. It came off
all right up to the point when the simple
spouse ejaculated: “Oh, so delighted to
nieet you, Madame ! Do vou know, I often
buy your chocolates.” After Melba had re-
covered from the fit, she issued terrible
orders that for the future any devil seeking
the_ privilege of branding his wares with the
divine cognomen was to be suddenly
smothered.
‘‘D°m Bill” Lyne was impecunious ; “Oom
Bill Tyne didn’t always pay his debts. He
would put money in his pocket to pay a
tradesman; three minutes later he would
empty it out to relieve a deadbeat. This was
the only foundation for many cruel stories
that were told—vague stories in which the
mg, bluff Australian figured as a sort of
political three-card man. A managing direc-
tor of one of Australia’s biggest financial
concerns was talking of “Oom Bill” a while
back. Bill had been put on the Board of this
concern very many years ago, and had been
permitted to hold his seat ever since. “There
ba 7 e b ? en .dozens and dozens of times when
old Bill might have made a commission,” he
?aid. ‘The fact was he didn’t even know
the chance was offering. He had no more
idea of turning a bit of early information to
his own financial advantage than he had of
Hying. He sometimes let 'people put him
into a false position because he didn’t grasp
what they were driving at. When he did
grasp it there ikas a big, wild man using
vigorous language. I’ve never known Bill
do a crooked thing, and that’s on 25 years’
close business acquaintance.” But the best
proof of all that the old man’s enemies lied
about him was his persistent poverty Not
that it worried him: he really had‘no use
for money except to give it away.
Thomas Sutherland, chairman of the P.
and O. Co., in London, and oracle on all
matters connected with the British mercan-
tile marine* has decided, at 80 years of age,
to retire from his strenuous job. Consider-
able part of his strenuosity was employed
in shovelling hostility upon (he White Aus-
tralian policy. Also, he perspired mentally
in opposition to the Australian conditions
imposed on Britain’s shipping owners under
the Federal Navigation Bill, which is at
present awaiting the assent of George V.
In between times he attended to other
things, but those already mentioned made
him of interest to Australians. It wasn’t
an absorbing interest.
Died in South Aus. (1) Henry Comyn, of
Gladstone, a doctor since 1874, and there-
fore the senior, barring T. W. Corbin, of
them who are licensed to kill-or-cure in that
State. (2) George Thomas, who was sent
to the Crimea at 18, and was one of the
‘forlorn hope” 400 who tried to storm the
tie dan at Sebastopol (killed 130, wounded
110, captured <O, got back to camp 30.).
Afterwards he had some hard fighting in
Maoriland, but he had been a good South
Australian for 40 years. He had the mili-
tary funeral given in Adelaide to all veter-
ans. (3) Suddenly, on the beach at
Glenelg, Rev. N. A. Ross, a burly and elo-
quent Newcastle-on-Tyne man, who had
bossed the. biggest Presbyterian church ,n
South Africa for 10 years, and was just
thinking of settling down at Chalmers
Church, Adelaide.
Exit, in London, G. W. Taylor, the Man
who really Broke the Bank at Monte Col-
iins-street.. Taylor was a decent, kindly
super-imaginative speculator in real estate
who thought, when Victoria borrowed
twenty-five millions between 1886 and
1890, that Melbourne was destined to be
very soon as big as New York, and the
capital of a . thickly-populated country,
laylor s belief in the greatness of Australia
was with him mere megalomania. Only
one land-boomer was more obsessed with
the idea, and that was B. J. Fink; and
both backed their opinion splendidly—with
other people s money. G. W. Taylor was
Mayor of P’ran in its palmy days, and it
was from C. H. James that he learnt the
art of buying suburban paddocks at 3d. a
toot, and cutting them up to sell at £3.
He had more bills under discount—
frequently several sets for the same block —
during 1888 than any other two land-
boomers unitedly. Here was the group:
B. J. Fink, T. Bent, C. H. James, G. W.
laylor, J. McA. Howden, W. L. Baillieu,
M. 11. Davies.. Every one of them was a
paper millionaire. Of course, there were
satellites, but these were the captains of
the industry of buying land cheap and sell-
mg dear. Finally, the Bank of Monte
Collins-street became oppressive and menac-
ing, and a company was proposed to buy
all G. W. Taylor’s assets. The capital
suggested was £4,500,000. The directors
were to be B. J. Fink. Alfred Deakin, J.
McA. Howden and G. W. Taylor. But the
scheme failed, and Taylor was given a
cheque to go to London; and he went with
much celerity.
THE DRY FACTS OF THE CASE.
A P art y of thieves set out on Wednesday night
with the intention of raiding bowling greens. They
dealt with two or three. From the first green—
Randwick-they secured nine boxes of Cigars, thr ee
bottles of brandy and a bottle of whisky. Their
attention was next turned to Waverley, where they
gathered three boxes of cigars and about £10 worth
of tobacco.
“Playin’ bowls this afternoon , Archie?”
“No hope. Burglars got in. Nothin’ left to
play with.”
A novel—perhaps unique—incident oc-
curred recently in N. S. Wales Full Court.
As Chief Justice Cullen was about to deliver
an important judgment, it was found that
the official shorthand writer was absent •
whereupon Justice Ferguson, who was one
of the Court, got back to his old job and
took a verbatim note of the iudicial say-s«.
Father Bernard Vaughan, the Roman
Catholic “Reformer” who has made a splash
in London with his plain talks about “the
sins of Society,” is to visit Sydney next
year. An elder brother, Roger Rede was
one-time Archbishop of Sydney. Bernard is
the twelfth of the fourteen children 0 f
Colonel Vaughan, of Courtfield. There were
nine sons, six of whom entered the Church
and five daughters, all of whom becamp
nuns.
THE NATIONAL BRAND.
Ginger : The Australian track has seen
more illustrious swaggies than Ralph \v ii-
liams, who rose to be a colonial Governor and
k.C.M.G. (B. 17/7/T3). We’ve even had
a king among us—Jorgensen, of Iceland.
Australian caricaturist Will Dyson, who
has developed into an effective public speaker
in England, was called upon recently to ad-
dress a large gathering of students at
uxtord, m a furiously radical vein, on “The
conspiracy to convert people into things
easily governed.” He took so well that
there was an enthusiastic demand for an-
other dose, and Dyson responded with an
address on “Cartoons.” Oxford had been
split into fierce factions over the question of
excluding the Daily Herald from the read-
because of the “blasphemous” and
disloyal _ qualities of its caricatures. In
the resulting disputation the artist was em-
braced as a sort of Bird of Freedom by the
large, democratic minority. By the way,
Dyson’s upward movement in England has
been given further impetus by Frank Rutter.
8.A., Curator of the Leeds Art Gallery, and
a foremost critic. In the course of a lecture
ue advised those English people who doubted
their own taste in pictures, to cut out Will
Dyson s brilliant cartoons,” mount them on
brown paper, and decorate their homes with
them. _ ‘ln a few years’ time,” he said,
collections of Dyson’s cartoons will be as
eagerly sought after as those of Gillray are
to-day.”
The youngest Anglican Bishop in the
Commonweaßh is John Oliver Feetham, of
JNorth Queensland, who entered the forties
on January 28, and wore the gaiters for the
rif st °. n 25. A Bishop’s job in
the .North is neither lucrative nor restful
but in those respects it matches Feetham’s
previous billets. He put in eight years as a
curate in Bethnal Green (London), and six
more m a Bush Brotherhood with its head-
quarters at Dubbo (N.S.W.), though he
was chiefly occupied in arid corners
° f t m-u v i ne > T ard such as Canbelego
and libooburra. As head of the
Brotherhood, he was allowed 10s a week
for picket money. The Dubbo Brotherhood
has never boasted a "nug” like parson Sams,
who belongs to a similar society in Central
Queensland , but it used to have a good demo-
crat in C. 11. S. Matthews— “Brother
Lharles —who was practically hounded out
ot Australia by the wealthy members of his
flock because he dared to speak on a Labor
platform.. Feetham was similarly an object
of suspicion, because of his fondness for con-
sorting with sleeper-cutters, tank-sinkers,
fearers, and other riff-raff, and because he
didn t dress like a gentleman.” The prin-
cipal peculiarity of his dress nowadays is
that he is one of the few Anglican Bishops
in Australia game to wear a mitre in public.
Most of the others keep that article only
tor display on their notepaper and motor-
cars.
THE HARP AND THE TROMBONE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As tyrants, women are ridiculous; as ministering
angels, there is no limit to their power. The harp
is their instrument—not the trombone.
—Beerbohm Tree.
Peace, lovelj' woman 1 Keep your nerves in check,
And let not passion crack your voice’s tune;
We know of sorrows you’ve a perfect peck,
Beset by squalling brats and trousered loon;
Yet none the less suppress a grievous groan ;
Touch up the harp and drop the mad trombone!
If Bill comes rolling home, aflood with beer,
And dances fiercely on your cups and cans,
Slang-whang him not, but hail him “duck” and
“dear,”
And let him dance fandangoes on the pans ;
And should he sing some ditty all his own,
touch then the harp and leave the mad trombone!
When to your sweet domestic tribe of ten
Another comes by Fate’s supreme decree,
And podgy Bob and sturdy little Ben
In hourly conflict grip and disagree,
The while the bonused infant makes its moan—
Again the harp and not the mad trombone!
When scandal-mongering neighbor Betsy Prig
At your expense wags round a vicious tongue,
As thus: “She’s got a temper like a pig,
And drives ’er ’usband ev’ry night to Bung;
The likes of ’er is better left alone”—
Again the harp and not the mad trombone!
And when you can’t get even with the rent,
And Grubbe the grocer growls about his bill,
And then you find, with worry overspent,
The “boss” has drowned his sorrow in the swill,
While Jack, your eldest, proves a useless drone—
Take up the harp, and leave the mad trombone!
And, last of all, should Chadband unctuouslv
Drop in and hail you, “Sister, pray for Grace,
Remembering we all must chastened be!”
Nay, do not throw the teapot in his face,
Or heave behind him malediction’s stone—
Take up your harp, and drop the mad trombone !

Fin's bank lias the foundations; now it wants the
(business. The foundations are very fine There is a
share capital of £1,195,398, besides £1,692,092 of
4 p c. inscribed deposits, the latter repayable at the
bank s option, although £15,000 must be put aside
■each half-year to reduce the debt. The £15,000
need not, however, come out of profits. Moreover
ithere is every reason to believe that the whole of
this share and inscribed capital, as well as the re-
serves, is represented by live assets worth 20s. in
the £. The management, when it was hammering
•out a scheme to reconstruct the old A.J.S. Bank
wrote assets down to what it believed to be bed-
aock ; and they were written down again after that
With intact funds of this size the A.B.C. could
safely take £.12,000,000 or £14,000,000 of deposits
xind other public money, and lend out £10,000,000
■or £11,000,000. As a matter of fact, all the de-
posit and other public money it has is £2,799 035
•and its advances total £3,864,629. One result of
having so much fixed or good-as-fixed capital is that
•depositors’ security is at present and must for some
.years to come be extraordinarily good. The bank
•could pay in prompt gold more than half of all it
•owes to depositors and other creditors, and it has
other assets valued at more than twice the total of
the other half of the debts. If the public is looking
for good security, it won’t be deposits that the A.B.C.
will be short of for some time to come. What the
bank needs more than anything else is a good bor-
rowing connection. And gradually it ought to
attract that too, for the wise borrower seeks a bank
which is strong enough to help him not so much
when times are good as when they are bad ; and this
bank is strong enough to do that. At present it
really is much too strong for the immediate profit
of its shareholders.

This paper would rather have seen the advances move
the other way. There was certainly no need in this
case to call in money in order to strengthen the
cash- position, for, as mentioned before, more than
oO p.c. of the liabilities (other than the inscribed
deposits) are represented by liquid assets; and those
liquid assets are nearly all gold and Australian
notes, which locally are as good as gold. Still, this
isnt a business that can safely be forced. There
was a time when bank managers were practically
driven out with lassos in their hands and told to
bring m borrowers, by gentle methods if possible,
by force if necessary; but that policy didn’t pay
then, and it wouldn’t pay now.
Regarding the shares as an investment, two things
at least must be noted. (1) The security is appar-
ently Al. The £1 shares are marketable at only
about 12s. Unless there have been dreadful miscal-
culations, there is 20s. of assets for every £1 of
capital, so the 12s. share is backed by 20s. of
assets. (2) The dividend is small, and is not likely
to be large for many years, for the capital is so big
that to pay even 5 p.c. would mean distributing
£23,900 a year more than is paid at present. Pro-
gress will probably be steady—assuming good man-
agement, of course—-but it is too much to expect it to
be rapid.

On capital and reserves combined the profit for the
past half-year was at the rate of £7 6s. 3d. p.c.
p.a., so it begins to look as though most if not all
of the capital has been reinstated. It has been a
long, uphill fight. Probably this bank was in no
better position than the average after the financial
crisis of the early ’9o’s; but, unlike the vast
majority, it didn’t get rid of its troubles by shut-
ting its doors for a few minutes and then compound-
ing with its creditors. Instead of even asking its
shareholders to regard some of their capital as gone,
it set to work to make good the losses (which it didn’t
admit) out of profits (which it thus wasn’t able to
admit either). It was heroic in a way, but was a mis-
take; people didn’t know how bad the position inside
might be, so they mostly passed the institution by.
Fortunately the bank had some strong friends, and
with the help of these the long struggle was main-
tained, and, as remarked above, it looks now as if
it had about reached an end. Certainly the market
doesn’t yet put a par value on the shares; one lot
of £8 shares are quoted at somewhere about £5
125., and the other lot (with a £2 liability) at
£5 ss. But the market is governed very largely by
the dividend paid and doesn’t take much heed of
the fact that in the past 12 months, wh ; le the
shareholders have had only 5 p.c., another 2J p.c.
or more has been put by or written off the premises
account.
Handicapped though it has been, the bank has
made pretty good progress during the past 10 years.
As at June, 1903, all the public’s money in the
business (deposits, etc.) was £1,251,999; to-day it
is £1,943,560. And while 10 years ago the ad-
vances were £1,204,941, they are now £1,601,900.
Nothing tremendous, of course, in the way of
growth; but probably the quality has improved
more than the quantity. At any rate, if the steadv
growth of the disclosed profits means anything at
all, it ought to mean that. This was a case in
the balance-sheet figures didn't mean what they
saia. assets, tor instance, were never openly written
down, no matter how little they were really worth

This co. has been in the business 35 years, which
have been 35 years well spent. And it has accumu-
latea something besides wisdom and experience,
though it set out with a paid capital far greater
than most trustee cos. have thought necessary, it isn’t
content to offer its customers the security of that
capital ( £90,000) alone, but it is steadily building
up a reserve fund, and makes no secret of the fact
‘hat it is aiming at £lOO,OOO. This, of course, is
all to the advantage of the beneficiaries under the
trusts committed to the co. As it found out years
ag°. even the most careful trustee co., fortified bv
what looks like the best legal opinion, may misread
its instructions and become liable to beneficiaries ;
hence the T., E. and A. offers its clients a substantial
guarantee that, if it goes wrong, it will be able to
stand the consequences. As a matter of fact, the
risks are not large. But they are there; and the
tact that there has been no trouble for many years
is no proof that trouble won’t occur when, for in-
stance, a bad slump has reduced property values, and
left beneficiaries disappointed and disposed to fasten
the blame on to somebody. Moreover, this co. aims
at giving something more than good security on
paper Of its capital. £60,000 is represented bv
a Collms-street freehold which, though no doubt of
greater value than when it was purchased, has been
written down from about £70,000 to the present
kas £41,557 in public securities and
£6721 in cash; and of the balance £35,232 is on
mortgage. _ Considering the size of the reserves, the
dividend is small; but shareholders, as well as
clients, have fine security. And shareholders have
excellent prospects, too. The business has grown
steadily—the estates in hand were £7,467,202 10
years ago, and they are £10,120,497 now—and
such a strong case can be made out in favor of hav-
ing trustee work done by trustee cos. that it seems
impossible for the business, speaking generally to
go back to the old, untrained hands.

A very profitable little business, like that of most
trustee cos., and carrying comparatively small r.sks.
Capital and reserves combined amount to £36 588
and nearly £34,000 of that lot is in cash or public
securities; and practically all the rest is repre-
sented by severely written down office premises. Not
many businesses can show an average profit of about
9 p.c. on capital and reserves while keeping; those
funds in such gilt-edged securities. Certainly there
are other risks: a bad mistake made in reading a
will, for instance, might cost the co. thousands
But, with care, such mistakes seem to be easily
avoided. Where there are doubts the courts can
always be applied to for directions, in which respect
trustees have an advantage over most people who
have to do a thing first and find out whether it is
right or wrong afterwards. Moreover, the progress
of the co., so far as new business is concerned is
satisfactory. Five years ago the estates in hand
were valued at £1,341,899; now the total is
£l, (12,250. And there is plenty of room yet for
m spite of the advantages they offer, it is doubtful
whether trustee cos. do more than one-third "of the
trustee work in Victoria, notwithstanding that they
are more numerous and have a firmer hold there than
in any other State of the Commonwealth.
Automatic Telephones (Australasia),
Ltd. (Sydney).—'This co. was formed a couple of years
ago to acquire certain Australasian rights to the
patents of the Automatic Electric Co., of Chicago The
authorised capital is £250,000, in 245,000 ordinary
£1 shares and 100,000 deferred Is. shares Thus
far 100,000 ordinaries have been issued and are now
paid to 10s.; the deferred shares, which were ap-
parently issued for goodwill, belong wholly or mostly
to the Standard Waygood and Hercules Engineering
Co. (Sydney). An excellent bargain was made in
the purchase of the rights or agency: £10,500 was
paid as a deposit, to be forfeited if i. 0,000 lines were
not ordered before June, 1914. If the order came
to hand, the deposit was to be part of the payment
for the goods. As already 13,000 lines have been
sold and ordered, the deposit is safe. So far of
course, very little profit has beeen made; the pub-
hshed accounts nevertheless show a book-keeping
profit of £3 for the first year and £567 for the
P uwi^ ear ‘.,i® n ,J une 30 the value of contracts (made
™ lth 7he Commonwealth Government) was
£120,000, and tenders for another £115,000 worth
were then under the Department’s consideration.
Of the capital of £55,000, £31,357 is represented
by work in progress (less payments received), £5OOO
by goodwill, £10,500 by the deposit with the
Chicago co., and the balance is made up of cash,
iieposics with tenders, uiitl sundries. The accounts
naturally give no indication of the profits which the
co may expect; much depends on the bite the
Chicago people take, and as “it would seem desir-
able that some negotiations now in progress should
be conducted personally,” one of the managing direc-
tors is to go on that errand. These managing direc-
tors are the two king-pins of the Standard Waygood
Co., and what they thought of the prospects of the
c°- and the remarkable invention may be judged by
the fact that for the goodwill they took deferred
shares, which merely entitle the holders to half the
profits left after the ordinaries have got 10 p.c.

This co. was born in 1887, and a little while after-
wards it wished it never had been. That was when
it blew off the froth and found that the more or less
solid substance underneath represented only 4s. 6d
in the £ of one lot of shares and 9d. for each" 15s
of the other lot. Still, there was the nucleus of a
business, and G C. Willcocks, “Tom” Welsby and a
few more people took it in hand. After nursing it for
a while, they saw possibilities ahead, especially as
was waxing fat, and forgetting all its
old troubles, and showing- a disposition to fill-’em-
up-agam. In 1905 the capital, having been severely
written down, was still onlv £16,025. The build-
ings being poor and the equipment out of date, the
directors decided that the co. must have more money.
By degrees the capital has been brought up to £6O 000
the last issue of 66,666 shares having been made
last year at par (4s 6d.). Even that, however, has
f lv , en , . the co. less than it could do with very com-
fortably ; for in view of the ranid increase of busi-
ness, so much more has been absorbed by stock and
hook debts apart from the new plant altogether that
the iiab.lities haven’t been reduced at all: ’ toat

and the amount required to pay an 8 p.c. dividend
Out of the surpluses £21,377 has been available
during the past five years to strengthen the co.’s
position, while only £14,974 has been paid away in
dividends. A co. that can show a record like that
deserves to be spoken about respectfully, especially
as something (amount unspecified) has been steadily
charged to profit and loss to cover ordinary wear
and tear.

Thb Bulletin puts it that way with some reserva-
tions. Besides the formal reserve fund there is a
“depreciation insurance reserve,” which has hitherto
been built up of amounts shown above as written
off. But during the past six months £7OOO has
dropped into that account without mentioning where
it came from ; and there is no h.nt as to its charac-
ter. It may be ordinary trading profit, which is un-
likely ; or it may be profit made on a sale of pro-
perty ; or it may be simply that the co. has revalued
some assets and reckons them worth £7OOO more
than old book-values. With this addition the de-
preciation fund stands at £14,567, which amount
is not included with the reserves shown above. The
co., which is still under seven years old, has so fai
done very well; the Westralian thirst remains just
about the richest gold-bearing reef over on that side.
Capital is £60,000 ; liabilities of all kinds
£16,446. Against this and the reserves there is a
miscellaneous heap consisting of freeholds and lease-
holds, plant, goodwill and water supply, £104,856-
and stocks, book debts, etc., £11,270.' Whether the
miscellaneous heap is worth what the books allege
or whether the £14,567 to the credit of deprecia-
tion fund should be struck off the total, this paper
hasn t the slightest idea. But in anv case, it looks
a cheerful set of accounts, not the least cheerful
feature being the fine margin of profit left after the
10 p.c. div. is paid.

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re-
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf
Bleichert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,
Melbourne and Sydney, are the Australian representa-
tives, and would be pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to
consult and advise.*

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Hardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem ; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“the Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.
The Austral Otis Eng. Co., Ltd., of Melbourne, are
the sole representatives for them in the Common-
wealth, and will be glad to forward particulars.* [1

plus the interest earnings. Of course an office can’t
get policies for nothing. It costs, roughlv, just as
much to rope in a policy which endures for onlv a
year as it does to lasso one which endures for' 50
years. But to charge a policy of this sort with, sav,
£B5 strikes this paper as evidence of either a vora-
cious appetite or a stern resolve to discourage the
early surrender of policies, no matter what change
the circumstances of the insurer may have under-
gone.
One moral of the story is: Beware of over-insur-
ance. Lots of people are under-insured ; and many
of them are under-insured because at some time or
other they have taken out a bigger policy than they
could comfortably manage, and have then let the
whole thing go. And another is: Beware of child
insurance. It may be all right where the insurer
is afraid of himself and doesn’t believe he would
keep up the payments if he weren’t obliged to. If
he isn’t a person of that sort, he will find it in
nearly every case preferable to put money in a
savings bank, from which he will get back his pre-
miums with interest added if the child dies. A
lump sum, paid in on the birth of a child, can often
be afforded, and is probably the best investment:
£lOO lodged when Phyllis is born is worth £206
when Phyllis is 21, even if the interest averages
only 3i p.c. And if Phyllis dies at 20, there is
£199 to comfort Phyllis’s sister, or her mother,
which is better than the return of the £lOO without
interest. Or if £5 a year is dropped into the
Savings Bank at 34 p.c. and £5 is added every
year, by the time Phyllis is 20 there will be £l4l
waiting for her; and if she died at 18, instead of
the bare refund of the £9O of premiums, there
would be £122 10s. for someone to draw—and pro-
bably more, for the interest is often over 3£ p.c.
As a matter of fact, infant insurance is insurance
only in the most limited degree. Unable to protect
themselves against under-standard risks, since there
is no medical examination, the offices merely consti-
tute themselves bankers of the premiums until the
child has reached 21 and has more or less proved
that it is a good life ; and it hangs on to the whole
of the interest earnings to pay itself for its trouble in
holding and using the money until then. If the
child survives till 21 the bargain is only a very
moderate one. If the child doesn’t survive till 21
it is a wretchedly bad bargain. If a man must have
insurance for his child, he had better take the policy
out on his own life, under a table which provides that
premiums stop on the death of the person who takes
out the policy.

The North Coast (N.S.W.) Co-operative
Co., Australia’s biggest cow-country concern, made
the trifle of 4119 tons of butter last half-year, and
put through 21.714 pigs as a side-l ; ne. The average
price realised for the butter was 10.9 d. in the Syd-
ney and inter-State trade, and on the quantity
shipped to some place that the directors call “Home ”
the average drawn was 9.57 d. per lb. The foreign
(that is to say, Svdney and inter-State) market paid
the co. £319,375 for the cow-fat; the “Home”
market paid £87,518 ; and cured pig ran into
£61,108. There wasn’t much profit in it for the
co., whose chief object in life is to make things
good for its co-operative suppliers. After providing
£3OOO for depreciation and £lOOO for the marine
insurance fund, there was £5663 left over, and this
will be carried along to the end of the year, when it
wijl be cut up in dividend and bonus.

Ormis Metal Manufacturing Co., Ltd.
(Sydney), is to have a capital of £lOO,OOO in £1
shares, and issues an undated prospectus asking for
subscriptions for 30,000 shares. Vendors are to get
25,000 paid shares and £2500 cash for the patent
rights of the metal for the Commonwealth, and
45,000 shares are reserved to be issued at the will
of the Board. Ormis metal is said to be an
alloy of aluminium, tin, copper and lead, and has
excellent qualities; but the metal bears a strong
family resemblance to navaltum, an aluminium alloy
with Rothschild money behind it, an English factory
glutted with orders, and a threat to start a factory
in Australia. Ormis metal is an Australian inven-
tion, and it is to be hoped that Australia spoke
first. But it is a pity that the people who have it
in hand opened their mouths so wide when they
spoke to the public. The shares may pass ; but no
money should have been taken in view of the fact
that the metal hasn’t yet been produced on a com-
mercial scale.
Gold divs. amounting to £436,821 were
paid by Westralian cos. for the first half of this
year—£26,733 more than in the corresponding
half of 1912. To the end of June the aggregate
sums loosed by the principal producers werej —
Great Boulder, £4,022,425; Ivanhoe, £3,118,750;
Golden Horseshoe, £3,075,000; Oroya-Brown Hill,
£2,157,241; Great Fingall, £1,734,375; Lake

After paying for everything Lake View
and Star (W.A.) wound up its year on February 28
with a surplus of £34,398. This has been applied
in payment of dividends aggregating 16 p.c., divi-
dend duty, and directors’ percentages. Altogether
212,606 tons were treated during the year for
£252,890, equal to 235. 9d. per ton. Costs aver-
aged 19s. lOd. Ore reserves are estimated as fol-
lows:—Lake View leases, 107,050 tons, worth
30s. 4d. per ton; Hannan’s Star leases, 305,720 tons,
averaging 265. 9d. ; together, 417,770 tons, worth
275. 7d. With the exception of a block of
27,520 tons, no ore below 500 ft. in the Hannan s
Star has been included. Taking into account that
good values have been met with in the 600 ft., i 00tt.,
900 ft. and 1100 ft. levels of the Star, the reserves
have been estimated on a conservative basis.
Bulletin remarked a year or so ago that tor its
size the Lake View and Star was one of the best ot
the Kalgoorlie bunch, and it still thinks so.
Algernon Moreing told shareholders from
the chair at the Fingall (W.A.) meeting that the
co. had done very well out of the upper workings
during the past year, and that it was intended to
continue cleaning up around the old stopes as long
as ore could be found of high enough grade to show
a small profit. This stuff would be mixed with the
richer material from the new deep-level shoot, but
what proportion of the monthly tonnage it would
form the management was not yet able to say. tie
added that during the past 12 months the .co. had
had a look at a fair number of offered mining pro-
perties in the West and elsewhere, and at present
held a half interest in a small exploration syndicate
which was testing a promising sold show.
The abolition of the “night” shift at the
Great Boulder (W.A.) is welcomed by all hands and

yt ‘ at j a . s ’ w 'fn a few isolated exceptions, development
work is not proving as fruitful as formerly. No
improvement has taken place in the position of the
mam lode at the lowest levels, and it is not con-
sidered prudent to incur expenditure on further shaft
sinking at present. Drilling was done continuously
during the year, wherever there were indications of
further ore bodies being disclosed, but no important
discoveries were made.. While there seems to be little
hope for the mine in' depth, the possibilities of the
upper levels are not yet exhausted. One previously
overlooked make of stone was lately unearthed at No.
and a vigorous search is being made for
others. Meantime no effort is being spared to find
another producing property as an investment for the
co. s surplus funds. Already something has been
acquired in Alaska, and experts are on the lookout
for things elsewhere.

W estralian Mines Dept, is being ridi-
culed in the West for publishing information about
gold yields, developments, etc., months after the in-
tormation was ripe. Not so long ago a mine which
had been given up as hopeless was referred to in the
departmental budget as looking splendid, while an-
other, which had previously snuffed out, was described
as having good prospects.

A fair amount of hard cash in the form
of unclaimed dividends was held by a number of
Westralian gold-mining cos. at the date of their last
balance-sheets. Great Boulder had £11,306; Ivan-
hoe £2751, Great Fingall £2630, Sons of Gwalia
£2437, Kalgurli £1939, Oroya Links £913, Asso-
ciated Northern £BBl, Boulder Perseverance £546,
Golden Horseshoe £575, Lake View and Star £251,
South Kalgurli £197, and Hainault £34.
Lionel Robinson and party have aban-
doned their option over Rollo’s deep-lead claims at
Kanowna. The show is stated to be all right for a
small party, but not big enough for a co. to make
money out of. Robinson and co. still have the Gim-
let at Ora Banda and the Golden Valley leases at
Kanowna on their hands.

Geologist Dr. Maclaren has just com-
pleted a. tour of the W.A. goldfields. It was on
Maclaren’s advice that Moreing and others sunk an
internal shaft from the No. 13 level of the Great
Fingall, and the result of this work upset for once,
at any rate, the theory that quartz reefs do not hold
their values to any great depth in the West. Lat-
terly Maclaren has been examining the Fenian and
Queen of the Hills at Meekatharra, the Sons of
Gwalia at Leonora, and the Ivanhoe at Kalgoorlie.
It is wholly and solely on the advice of this expert
that the Ivanhoe management is continuing the
dreary work of sinking through a poor zone in the
bottom of the mine, and it is also on his tip that
the prospecting of the western portion of the pro-
perty (including the old Ivanhoe Junction lease,
which he believes will carry high values in depth) is
to be undertaken.
Golden Ridge (W.A.) has made a start
to prove the worth or otherwise of its latest option
at Yerilla. Last year about £3OOO worth of gold
was got from one portion of the show and about
£5OOO in bullion from another part. The district
has always been noted for rich patches, but, as a
rule, they don’t extend very far or very deep. The
Ridge’s present property at Waterfall is gradually
passing away, but it may be some time yet before
its name appears among the obituary notices.
The accounts presented to Boulder No. 1
shareholders on June 30 showed a total credit of
£8873. On account of the abandonment of the St.
George mine at Magnet, this balance is not dealt
with, but is carried forward. The co.’s lease at
Kalgoorlie was worked softly by tributors during the
year, and is still in their hands. Out of the final
profits made from the St. George lease a slimes
dump was purchased at Long Reef, Lennonville; in-
cluding the removal of plant, the total outlay on
this spec, was about £4844. The treatment of this
dump was commenced in January last, and a fair
profit is showing. A “constant search” is being made
for new property, and with the plant now on hand
a small mine could, if found, be well equipped at a
low cost.
Edna May (W.A.) recently offered 5000
of its 7200 reserve shares for the adjoining Myrtle
Central lease, and the syndicate which owns the
latter has now expressed its willingness to sell if the
remaining 2200 shares are thrown in. The inclusion
of the Central in the Edna May holding would give
an additional 300 ft., or thereabouts, on the line of
reef, and make the property a more solid proposition
in every way.
The local paper, which generally knows
what’s what, states that the Marvel Loch (W.A.) will
cease operations at its present mine at the end of
this month, and give its whole attention to the
Comet option. Low returns, arsenical conditions
and a deluge of water are said to have influenced the
Board in coming to this decision. The Comet is
declared to be opening up well, and 500 tons of ore
raised from development are about to be put through
the mill. Strong' doubts as to the permanency of
the reef in depth are still held by experts.
* * * *
New Bendigo. St. Arnaud (Vic.), still
fancies it is a mine. Because last half-year >t got
an average of 7jdwt. from the reef at 360 ft., it
wants to work up sufficient enthusiasm to unwater
the north shaft to 450 ft. and climb through the
slimy drives to find out if the old miner left any-
thing worth having behind him. Remembering old
efforts to make the claim pay, “the future policy”
so much talked about should be to keep on the
7dwt. stone, and not waste cash in finding out where
such stone is not.
A little plan is in the air to fuse Dayles-
tords North Nuggetty on to the Central Ajax. But
it won t come off unless the cost to the Central is
mignty low. One yarn says the North goes in on
, are bas i s - This certainly would let out
the folk who bought heavily from 11s. to 215., and
also give the old Queen-street crowd some cash back,
out the Central isn’t in the bag yet. If anything is
done, the Central people should cast an eariy eye to
the question of filling at the North Nuggetty.
The old South German, Maldon (Vic.),
having opened out some 15dwt. dirt in its inter-
mediate level north under the prospector’s block, is
now' in the lists as a bit more than a humble pawn
in the mining game. With a record of 163,0890 z.
from 173,000 tons, and £341,000 paid in divs., any
speck of gold found was sure to bring in buyers. The
present flutter arises not from pluck on the part of
shareholders, but through a party of tributors grub-
bing under the old 1750 ft. level north and getting
Pke co ” having thus had the way shown,
diant want the miner to scoop more than could be
helped, so it shut off further tribute parties, and
itself put in an intermediate between the 1750 ft and
2000 ft. levels. As 2ft. of 15dwt. reef was met
earlier than the world reckoned, the whoop went up
that the northern continuation of the old South Ger-
man eastern shoot had been brought to light. But it
is a bit early to talk that way. The last ebullition
of the kind kicked prices to the 50s. mark, but
there was barely a dividend to warm the folk who
paid that price simply to nurse a very inert ancient
out of his second childhood.
At Wood’s Point (Vic.) All Nations is
still trying to pick up the old run of gold that in
its day made the claim as glorious as a poppy on
the mountain-side. Now the old story of the field
is being re-told. Poor stuff everywhere, and no
hint of an improvement. So bad have" things got
that only 310 tons went to the battery in the half-
year, and what it yielded must for shame be con-
cealed. There seems to be ground for asking the
board to apologise for not breaking away to other
more likely-looking spots on the dyke, this might
induce shareholders to stick to their scrip, whereas
they won’t hold on merely to be told at the end of a
half-year that “mine and machinery are in good
working order.”
The Mount Oxide (Q.) option to the
slim London crowd is off, after all. The present
Mount Oxide Co. is in 200,000 shares of £l, of which
30,000 are reserved against the £30,000 debenture issue
to the original owner, Ernest Henry. The London
people had the property under offer on a share-for-
share basis in a new co. (registered in London last
June) of £475.000. The Englishmen were to get
275.000 shares in return for putting up £150.000
working capital; but right through they have been
trying to squeeze out better terms. Their last
squeeze was in the direction of reducing the vendor
co.’s proportion of shares ; but the vendor sat tight,
finally declared the option off, and started negotia-
tions for a debenture issue for working capital. A
firm of engineers is prepared to tie the mine to
Burketown with a railroad payable in debentures,
and the Queensland Government is said to be ready
to guarantee the debentures. If so, the sooner a
move is made the better. Oxide is too big a mine
to be trifled with any longer.
Oxide Creek Syndicate, which has a show
three miles from Mount Oxide, and has been develop-
ing well, goes into a co. caoitalised at £125,000 in
ss. shares. A tunnel has been driven 150 ft. along
the outcrop, and a shaft sunk from surface in high-
grade carbonates has holed into ore at the tunnel
level. No. 2 vein has been driven on 70ft. north,
and 2ft. is worth over 10 p.c. A winze from this
level is down 50ft. in rich ore, and a crosscut at
the bottom shows lift, of first-rate stuff. The mine
will continue to shin ore as fast as it can be broken.
Mt. Molloy (Q.), which came a dreadful
cropper three or four years ago, is now negotiating
with the Queensland Government with regard to its
railway. After paying regular monthly divs. for
some time, the co. decided that, to prolong the divs.,
it would build a railway with the £40,000 or so
it had got to the credit of its reserve fund. As
usual, the work cost more than was estimated, and
the co. found itself a few thousand pounds in debt.
Simultaneously, the copper market slumped, and the
co., with little development work done, was in
trouble straight away. Practically the railway,
which connects with the line from Cairns, has thus
never been used. The debenture-holders, acting for
themselves and the co., suggest that the Government
should take over the line, on condition that half
the purchase money is put back into the mine; and
that condition, added to the fact that good timber
and some agricultural country would be served, as
well as a few small mines, is inclining the ear of the
Government to the proposal. Mount Molloy certainly
deserves more consideration than most mining cos.,
for, unlike the vast majority, it did build up a
decent cash reserve in the days of its prosperity.

Since that day 27 years ago when T. S.
Hall called in on his friend Darcy, the Rockhampton
solicitor, and told him that a chap named Morgan
had brought some nice-looking stone into the bank
and wanted some money, Mount Morgan has piled
up sizeable figures. Between July 1, 1886, and
May 31 of this year, the co.’s total income has been
£19,141,620; and here are a few of the items the
money has gone into: —
Dividends •• •• •• £8,079,164
Wages and mine contracts .. 5,587,208
Coal and coke . . ■ • 1,441,609
Firewood and charcoal . . 615,742
Machinery and plant . . 866,565
Stores and timber .. •• 44 L060
Dividend and income taxes . . 308,577
Railway freight . . • • 565,036
Some of the payments have been extraordinarily
modest. Directors’ fees for 27 years come to only
£36 996. Also, by the way, donations haven’t ex-
ceeded £7740. So far the Many Peaks Co. has
drawn £30,896 as royalty on the flux it supplies
to the co. —a bonus mostly to past and present officers
of Mount Morgan. * t *
Mount Morgan is adopting a new system,
and now reports its output for 28 days, thus falling
into line with most of the big mines. The last
return is an improvement; value of copper and gold
produced is calculated at £84,868 from 23,696
tons of ore. The average pans out over 71s. per
ton, and, as copper is taken at £6O, it is a pretty
safe estimate. For the 28 days’ run 766 tons of
blister were produced, containing 758 tons ot fine
copper and 93840 z. gold. A ton of blister contained
on the average nearly £lll worth of metals, so
the enrichment due to gold contents was approxi-
mately £5l per ton. The new control is plainly
going' to shake the market up.
* * * *
Brilliant Deeps. Charters Towers, lias
been crushing lower-grade stone, and the first clean-
up in Jnlv was onlv £ll5O from 342 tons Still,
it seems a fairer thing to take the return for the
first six months of the year, which was £15,457 from
3656 tons; average, £4 4s. 6d. per ton. Like the
Brilliant Extended, the Deeps will find it difficult to
value reserves correctlv. The old enthusiastic idea
that the crushing stuff would average £7 per ton
was hopelessly wrong. Driving in No. 6 level dis-
closes in and out values, although some of the stone
passed through in the shaft, a little higher than the
level was of great value. Brilliant Extended made
a snug profit of £l5OO in June, but it is too optimis-
tic to reckon that as an average. #
Improving returns come from Vegetable
Greek (NSW.). Last three weekly returns of con-
centrates- 50cwt., 60cwt. and 73cwt. Three shafts are
producing washdirt, which varies tremendously in
thickness and value, and it takes a deal of hard
work to keep on the track of the chain of ancient
pot-holes. There are 4000 acres to be ransacked and
130,000 shares to be fed —or starved. Hitherto
they have only been starved..
Frank Connor, M.L.C., the Westralian
cattle man who has done a lot to push the raw-meat
trade in “the East,” is back from the Philippines
and talking “placer” mining. He isn’t exactly an
uninterested party ; it would say less for his opinion
of the prospects if he had remained a mere on-
looker. The Cansuran concession, taken over by a
co. (mostly ’Murikan), of which Connor is a direc-
tor, is going to show whether there is money in the
business, or whether the calculations are all wrong.
They have a big enough area for a ’possum ranch,
though only half a square mile has been tested. On
that lot they figure on lid. per cubic yard, and
with a few rivers and waterfalls on the premises,
they put costs at what looks at this distance the
very low figure of lid. per yard. Outlay on plant
for hydraulic mining, with a good fall of water
handy, will certainly be a mere trifle, so depreciation
will count for next to nothing. There are many
other known gold-bearing areas in this island of Min-
dinao, and, if the Cansuran does well, Connor reckons
that Australia should have a cut, being handy and
knowing a thing or two about gold-mining.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, August 4, 1913.
My Dear Abini, —
What the spring races will bring forth is
foreshadowed by various exhibitions of fancy
tnlls. It is going to be a season palpitating
with color. Linen and silk coats (quite
short and semi-swallow-tail, with a rounded
effect at the back, of gorgeous blue or parrot
red) will top-dress kilted skirts of silk-
mushn or diaphanous ninon. Black aero-
plane overalls —that’s what they look like
though they are heavily disguised in the
-c rench language with cerise or emerald-
green belts, cover fantasies in foamy white
or grey lace.
~^n e, enough to be pulled through a
bangle, is an exquisite extravagance
or the premature spring. The pneumonia
blouse ot a season or two ago was a stout
wind-proof garment compared with the un-
dress of the present-day gown of conse-
rrr^ nce ’ • cu t to a deep Y in front.
V\ here it isn’t cut a film of gauzy drapery
transparent as a butterfly’s wing, is drawn
across the sylph-like form into a waist belt
of the most gorgeous color the dyer’s vat
can supply. The 1913-14 modes are designed
for the suffering rich, who starve amidst
plenty, in order to have a figure that is
lean enough to blow through a keyhole or
thereabouts.
G.-G. Denman took a brisk hand in all
the Kosciusko games, both outdoor and of
the parlor variety. He proposed Prof.
Blunno as a member of the house carnival
committee, and the ayes had it; for the
viticultural expert’s popularity runs to
about twice the length of his longest
shadow on the snow. The small, genial
Italian is still holidaying on Kosciusko’s
frozen pate. The tall Barttelot lady is mak-
ing arrangements to transfer her babes
later on to the airy hilltop for a snack
of snow sports.
Adelaide sent many handsome contribu-
tions to the carnival. From that city of
spires came Miss Billiet and Miss Baird,
notably good-looking and clad in the new
ski-costume. This gear was made of navy
blue. One coat was faced with white, the
other with canary. Bloomers of navy made
the foundation of these three-piece gar-
ments. A very short skirt is worn for the
departure from the hostel. When the
ski-er gets her blood up, and skims through
the soft snow, where she may fall as lightly
as on a bed of rose leaves, she can button
up the skirt. This leaves her nether gar-
ments free to wrestle with the fluffy land-
scape. Putties complete the weather-proof
outfit.
Melbourne _ sent a very smart ski-
runner in Miss Yencken. The attractive
lodman girls and Miss Feeder made a
party from the Momma State; and H. D.
Scott and two sisters, Mrs. Cullen Ward
and Miss Everett contributed to the amuse-
ments. With them was baritone Harold
Mulligan and violinist J. Garrison, both
amateurs of some size. One of the domestic
staff at the hostel had the bad luck to in-
jure herself rather seriously at the outdoor
revels, and the good luck to be nursed back
to normal by Miss Everett—a trained
Nightingale, who stubbornly attacked the
injury with hot compresses for 48 hours.
The thoroughly-vaccinated Nordica co.
has crept over the border to Melbourne
armed with certificates to soothe the sen-
tinels at Wodonga. The semi-farewell con-
cert on Saturday night was starred by the
American soprano’s stately ascent into Han-
del s lofty “Let the Bright Seraphim,” with
trumpet obligato.
tvt time in her Sydney season,
Nordica on Saturday wore something ap-
proximate to sleeves on her gown. They
were lacy affairs that hid the dimples in
her elbows. Her arms are as round and
shapely as those of an infant Hercules who
has been fattened on Somebody’s food, and
photographed to excite the envy of every
mother in his suburb. She abjures gloves
on the concert platform. This act of grace
gives women who take number sevens every
chance to contemplate the tiny fingers that
slip into a five suede without the aid of a
forcing machine. For the rest, Nordica
on Saturday night was heavily embroidered
with diamonds and crusted with emeralds,
and clad in ropes of pearls with motifs of
white satin and lace.
Dufault is singing like a skylark this sea-
son. “Au Pays,” one of his contributions,
is a stirring little French song. Jean Pierre
returns from the war clothed in rags and
glory, to find that his faithless Jeannette
prefers a good roof over her head. This was
the French-Canadian’s great hit in the
middle of last week. It has the tremendous
value of a big climax —“Bataille ! Bataille!”
Franklin Holding’s vaccinated leg gave him
no trouble in handling his fiddle with his
usual skill.
It was more or less by chance that
Romayne Simmons, of this company, drifted
to the piano stool. Born in ’ London,
brought up in Berlin (his mother was Ger-
man, by the way), the youthful Simmons
took music lessons from Scharwenke. If
you bumped against a Continental piano, I
believe this composer’s Polish dance would
tall out, so popular is it still. Inadvertently
lie studied music in his knickerbocker days
—partly because lie was too young to de-
fend himself; chiefly because his mother,
who was very musical, was a great friend
ol Mrs. Scharwenke’s. Later he turned to
ruts and Porous Plaster, and studied the
Art of Healing first in Berlin, then in Phila-
delphia. There he took his diploma, and
is duly qualified to look after his own vac-
cinated calf. But medicine had ceased to
charm. Young Dr. Simmons decided that
was born to be an actor. Luck and
ability put him into the part of Zou Zou in
Inlby. ’ After playing this for 42 weeks
through the States, the versatile German-
Lnglishman began to weary of the foot-
lights. What next? He was young, and
the world was wide. The late William
Steinway, then head of the piano firm, was
his friend. Steinway suggested that he
would give Simmons a line to Nordica. She
was then studying Wagnerian rbles and
intended to take a concert co. on tour in the
States in the gaps between her grand-opera
trills. Simmons had been dipped in German
music of the Wagner school in his helpless
infancy. So an association was begun
which has continued for 16 years. Inci-
dentally Simmons, being a man of many
pilgrimages, has been vaccinated about 14
times. The Sydney punctures have “taken”
in the third degree.
Governor Strickland’s first idea of giving
a dinner —the typical British mark of joy—
to the coming English Parliamentarians, has
been abandoned in favor of a ball. This is
likely to develop into a reception, with some
dancing for the fleet of foot.
Lord Emmott and his lady will camp at
State Government House during their stay
in Sydney. They are old friends of the
Stricklands. The veteran Baron Sheffield,
whose first birthday occurred in 1839, is
with the party. His contribution to the lit-
erary fare of England is a heavy-weight
volume called “Our National Education.”
“The Seaside Camps” meeting last week
brings the women and children of the bush
a few steps nearer the blue Pacific. Pro-
bably a suitable plot of land will be leased
in the Narrabeen district. The suggestion
to build huts or erect tents and have the
camp carefully organised is still being
thrashed out. A sympathetic builder is
said to be carving out a practical notion
tor permanent humpies. These he may, if
he puts on rose-colored specs, see his way
to run up at little more than cost price.
Miss Alice Currie, who mothered the idea
is hon. organiser; Minister for Lands
V£ e . ’ wllo takes a keen interest in the
affair, is vice-president; and there is a
committee which bubbles over with enthu-
siasm. After the first outlay is over the Sea-
side Camp is expected to pay its way. Cooking
will be engineered on more or less co-opera-
tive lines. The resourceful Women of the
Bush are not expected to perform miracles
with loaves and fishes. But they’re likely
to make a quartern loaf and a few fins go
a mighty long way.
The results of Hospital Saturday collec-
tion were recently handed over after an
exhausting survey of the merits of each
claimant. The economy, efficiency and
other domestic virtues in the management
of each hospital are peered into by experts
who work out their problem with marks
Prof. Anderson Stuart held out a joyfui
hand for a fat helping for his pet hobby
Prince Alfred Hospital; and St. Vincent’s
and Sydney nurseries also got away with
cosy cheques. Altogether about 30 hospitals
benefited by the £9OOO collection. Miss
Strickland handed the cheques over; but
the ceremony, which occurred in the vesti-
bule of the Town Hall, had been so scantily
advertised that it was chiefly remarkable
for the large number of persons who were
not present. Governor Strickland was in
charge of the meeting.
“Rosna” tells me of Hospital Day in
London :
Whitehall from Trafalgar Square to Westminster
was given over to Miss Australia and Miss Maori-
onnnn 11 Alexandra Day—the day whereon they and
20,000 other Misses sold wild roses and pillag’ed
London of £40,000 for the hospitals. As usilal
Maonland, which revels in “loyalty,” was most to
the fore, and had its name and address blazoned on
the ribbons of its flower baskets. Also, as usual
modest Australia went unlabelled. The marauders
were abroad as early as 8 a.m., and as the French
President was making an official call on Britannia
that day, there was plenty of populace to be shorn
of its guineas. To vary the strain in Whitehall
under-secretaries and other frock-coated persons made
tea-parties and carried off the Misses Australasia to
the War Office or the Home Office, or one or the
other seats of mis-government, for refreshment pur-
poses. And one good Australian scribe, Marv Grant
Bruce, improved the shining hour by telling the
Daily Mail, in a charming article, something of the
sister event, Wattle Day, in Australia. *
The London “sympathiser” who offers to
“sjs* British widows to emigrate to
N.B W. need not rouse the ire of the most
confirmed spinster in these parts. Provided
the widow’s mite is a helping hand in our
struggle with the eternal saucepans, she is
welcome. The really domesticated widow
promises better than the innumerable Eng-
lish governess who wants to come out to
Australia at any price. The teaching trade
here is gorged with mediocrity. Yet Aus-
tralian lecturers on the other side, who
know our needs as well as Grace Watson,
are inadvertently encouraging the nursery
governess to view this continent as the
Promised Land. Last mail brought a letter
from an optimist of this kind who has been
goaded to turn her face this way. She had
been told (in England, of course) that
“educated women were badly needed in Aus-
tralia.” A week or two ago, an educated
woman applied for the billet of daily gover-
ness in a local girls’ school. She was
offered £3O a year, and told to bring her own
lunch! The widow who can cook well will
be rushed with anything from £1 a week
upwards and her keep.
The South Sydney Hospital is to be
officially opened by Governor Strickland
next Saturday afternoon, August 9. Thirsty
visitors will be placated with tea and sun-
dries.
A Sydneysider who escaped to Mel-
bourne after proving that she had been
punctured in the left arm, had a word with
Private Sec. Victor Hood the other day.
He has just stepped into harness again,
an( l—though this has no connection with
the preceding remark—he has been unsuc-
cessfully vaccinated three times.
The late William Lyne’s first wife had
been Miss Martha Coates Shaw. She was
of the old house of Sir Robert Shaw—
the eldest daughter of Edward Carr Shaw,
Baronet, of Bushy Park, near Dublin. The
Shaws and the Parleys were intermarried,
and Mrs. Lyne was a cousin of the late
Chief Justice of N. S. Wales. But the
modest, sensitive and retiring lady never
mentioned her “lofty connections.” “They
might think,” she remarked once, “that I
wanted something from them—and what is
there that I could want?”
The Girls’ Guild Bazaar was opened
twice last week and showed its wares for a
season of two consecutive days. On Thurs-
day afternoon the Cullen lady tore it asunder
with a few remarks concerning the object,
ihis has in view the purchase of a small
motor to transport the clothes, etc., col-
lected for the Jumble Depot to its home in
burry Hills. The honorary lady-in-charge
is Miss Sutton. This enthusiast has hither-
to driven an uncertain-tempered beast in a
rocky van to gather up the garments given
by the . Fortunate to be sold at slaughter
prices in the Depot. On the second day,
Tit heradge re-opened the bazaar
which had been shut for exactly one night.
The “Butterfly” lady was motored to the
scene of action by Lewis Waller. She
slipped out of a comprehensive fur wrap
and displayed a dazzling garb of orchid
mauve, with a fluff of fur round its extrava-
gant hem. This young person finds £2OOO
a year just enough to keep her tidy, so her
frills are worth looking at. Organising sec.
Grace Burrows shadowed her bazaar-open-
ers on both days. Madge splashed money
about with both hands and refused
change with the seraphic smile of a young
millionairess. Mrs. Ethel Turner Curlewis
and Dame Hay rendered first-aid in the sale
of pot plants. Mrs. George Taylor was in
charge of the Art department, which varied
from very good bad. Mrs. Moseley,
Mrs. Macarthur-Onslow and the busy
Massey and Tatham girls were other
workers.
The Royal Art Society’s rooms, where the
bazaar raged, is more or less air-tight, and
the tea-room warmed up to about 1000 de-
grees in the shade. Singer Emilie Lambert
lent a hand in this department. Mrs. Tom
Raine, in smoke grey, was another pillar of
the cause. On the first day, the Governor’s
elder daughter and a younger member of
the Lranbrook kindergarten wedged their
way through the crowd. The veteran A.D.C.
Campbell, who mostly squires these youth-
ful damsels on their walks abroad, filled his
top hat with the smaller baggage, till it
overflowed with a pair of infant’s shoes,
which he had recklessly bought at a lingerie
stall. Assistant officer-in-charge was Miss
Birch, the governess. She’s incapable of
“ Vl P£ up t 0 her suggestive name, and the
Strickland kindergarten drags her along in
its wake.
The committee of St. Vincent’s Hospital
Ball is vigorously pushing the sale of

tableaux for the benefit of the galleryites.

The last will and testament of Lewis

—and other things as well. It is dated
February 1, 1892: “I hereby give to mv
dear wife, Eleanor, all my real and personal
estate, absolutely, and I appoint her sole
executrix of this my will.” And in 21
years’ experience the happy gentleman evi-
dently found no reason at all to make so

tiniest direction.

belle, last week. The Mayoress’s official
den was borrowed for the occasion. Mrs.
C. G. Wade, Mrs. Spencer Brunton, Mrs
F. Booth, and Mrs. ’Varsity David were the
chief conspirators.
The queer mixture of theology and pagan-

The John Douglas memorial chapei in that
steamy speck has just been finished. Accord-
ing to the gospel of a local corresDondent,
the. Torres Straits natives have given as
their to the building a window
representing the late Administrator as St.
John of I’atmos. The logic of this is quite
simple. The donors knew the appearance
of one John —they had no knowledge of the
saint’s features. So they have made a hand-
some compromise.
The latest style in hairdressing is fighting
its way to the front. It is very helpful to
the lady with large ears. Those orifices are
now completely buried under sleek locks of
the pattern that decorated the lobes of that
long-dead lady, Queen Victoria’s mother.
At some theatricals the other night
a pretty black-haired damsel wore the back
of her coiffure in a twisted knob like the
handle of a toy teapot. The rest of her
hair looked as if it had been gummed down
over her hearing machinery. A small dab
of raven tresses was also pasted down on
the outer edge of an ivory cheek. However,

My dear, put this to the credit of our
sex. now they are all talking vaccination,
that it was one of us who told Jenner that,
having had cow-pox, she wasn’t afraid of
small-pox. It put him on the scent; yet
the poor, nervous man was 17 years before
he had the pluck to try inoculation on a
boy. And for a while there ■was such a
row about it that I shouldn’t be surprised
if he wasn’t sorry he had ever tried at all.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 4, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The Australian Steeplechase drew Society
to Caulfield through the cold showers and
biting wind of Saturday afternoon. The
two Governors went out with their hair
jammed firmly on their heads and stayed
right through. The Forrest dame, wearing
a tan hat, sailed gaily before the wind in
company with a oright-blue niece, who had
hard work to keep up. (To be strictly
accurate, she didn’t. Auntie led all the
way and won by about a yard.) Mrs. Jim
1 urves looked demure in brown. Mrs. Cox,
the Daylesford heiress, wore three red-and-
white bows in a cheeky little hat. This
headpiece went with fur coverings. Mrs.
Leslie Stuart showed a nose-tip and one
very bright eye between a huge squirrel coat-
collar, which was turned up, and a smart
felt hat, which was turned down. The little
v iGRch Comans daughter supported a bonnet
that deserved a sonnet and other furnishings
of less degree. Mrs. Joyce looked pale after
her vaccination ordeal, which was gone
through in Sydney away from her doctor-
husband. Mrs. Moir, whose husband was
partner to the late Samuel Gillott, came
along with sister Mrs. Taylor, the latter on
the way from England to Siam. Linda
Byron Moore dared orange and green in
her hat. Half the girls present sported the
latest veils, which have a large blotch like
a splash of mud just on the cheek.
G.-G. Denman has offered a trophy to the
female bushranger who makes the biggest
haul on Wattle Day. The prize to be begged
for consists of a topaz brooch with a sprig
of wattle cunningly engraved on it. There
are any number of bosoms already heaving
with pride in anticipation of wearing this
gaud. All the theatres are throwing open
their plush seats to the wattle plunderers ;
the cafes have promised to nourish them
with unlimited buns and tea; the trams will
give them free rides ; the motorists are lend-
ing their second-best cars; a big business
college is doing all the typing; the Toy
Scouts will run the messages ; and—the man
in the street will do the swearing and the
paying. The gentle Society blossoms should
have a perfectly lovely time—and all for
Charity, of course!
One of those hitches that convulse
Society and shake Toorak to its foundations
happened at the recent Skating Carnival in
aid of the Blind Institute. Someone forgot
to tell someone else not to forget to remind
someone to be on the look-out for the vice-
regal party; so when his Ex. got to the
front door he stood helplessly on the, mat,
supported by attendant Helps, waiting for
the first note of Gorsave. The dreary tune
was not forthcoming, so the poor gentleman
and his followers froze steadily in the
draught. At last the news sort of perco-
lated through, and the band got the word
that started the tune that set the Function-
ary going again. Later on, when the prizes
were to be presented, a mass of police in-
telligence tried to make room for the solemn
ceremony by sternly ordering his Ex. to
“Stand back there, please!” Still, things
might have been a lot worse if the Law
had encountered him on arrival at the door.
Mrs. Peter Mcßride and the just-budded
Miss Peter were recently presented at Court
on the usual charge of being prominent per-
sons with ample means of support. (Peter,
you will remember, is our Agent-General.)
Mrs. Mcßride, whose appearance is always
creditable to this country, was a symphony
in coral-color and sea blue, while daughter
blushed prettily in white.
Glorious GenOe was out of the bill a few
times last week, and disappointed audiences
said all sorts of things—she was muscle-
bound, had strained a tendon, had con-
tracted ’flu’, writer’s cramp, and housemaid’s
knee. It seems most likely that the great
little Dane had been vaccinated. A band-
age could be plainly seen on her left leg:
and, later, when performing “La Carmago,”
two suspicious spots glared out through
the fleshings, so noticeable that the
tights_ were changed for the dance in “Les
Sylphides.” The adorable Schmolz is also
dressing one leg with a puttee, although she
has not (so far) missed a performance.
Mrs. Henry Stead, daughter-in-law of
Stead, departed, lately asked her friend's to
meet Dorothea Spinney, the classic play-
i-eader, who owns a yearning face, tragic
brown eyes, and a very scarlet mouth
softly _ curved. When pressed for a
recitation, Miss Spinney sat on the
corner of the table —a pretty spec-
tacle in a droopy grey dress and very spruce
black furs—and told the company about her
artistic beginnings. She was born at Strat-
ford-on-Avon, and contracted the disease at
the graveyard where William lies buried.
When she was 13 years old, an inspired man
came to her school and recited “Richard II.”
with such effect that she then and there de-
cided to get into the harrowing business
herself. She says that Stratford -on-Avon
(please be careful to broaden the “A”) has
become appallingly Shakspearian. While
performing “Hamlet” there, Benson gazed
over-lone at Yorick’s skull. A small boy in the
audience, thinking he had forgotten the
lines, prompted, “Alas, poor Yorick !” After
the recitress had told such yarns (and
thereby dodged the recitation), she was re-
warded with tea. Hostess Mrs. Stead (whose
blue dress contrasted nicely with her big,
round, brown eyes) was assisted by Mrs.
Gregan McMahon, who wore a brown dress
and blue eyes. The show, by the way, was
given in the Repertory Theatre Club rooms.
Numbers of men came in—a most unusual
thing for a mere tea-party. Statistician
ivnibbs attended and humbly handed cake,
and Morris Phillips wore the proper after-
noon-tea look. Gregan McMahon fussed
amiably. The hostess’s husband came late,
wearing a busy air, a disarming smile and
an immaculate top-hat. (The old fashion
ol creasing the belltopper by sitting on it
has gone out.) Mrs. Fred Marsh pondered
under very blue feathers how she could reach
New Guinea and yet avoid the quarantine
area. (If she can’t solve the problem under
blue feathers, she might try brown. Brown
is a good color to think in, and a
sixpenny feather-duster would serve.) Miss
Michaelis, in a purple outfit, had tea and
talked awhile to Dorothea, then dashed off
to a Bush Nursing meeting. Mrs. Vincent,
an Englishwoman who is accompanying her
electrical-engineer husband to Brisbane,
mourned for new-made Victorian friends
about to be left behind, until a patriotic
Bananalander became lyric on the glory and
hospitality of her State. Miss Spinney re-
marked that she loved being in “bright, sun-
shiny Melbourne.” Whereat the local
women hitched their furs closer about them
and remarked impatiently that she had
struck the city at its very dreariest time.
People here get annoyed when sunshine is
mentioned. It is like talking finance to a
family embittered by absolute ruin.
May Vale Gilfillan endured an invasion of
her studio as soon as the door was opened
last I riday morning. She has heaps of new
enamels on show, as well as some fresh pic-
ture-enamels of size, each of which took
months to finish. The centrepiece of the ex-
hibition is the moonlit bush cottage that the
Gallery people are stewing over. (The Fel-
top spenders go very slowly with the cash
when the item in view is a mere Australian
product.) There are some native orchids in
enamel that are worth gloating over, and a
Ilurstbridge wattle that smells of spring.
Baron von Camerer, a fine old man who
unhooked the German title from his name
and put “Mr.” in its place, died the other
day. I his naturalised Australian, who dug
his pen with great energy and enthusiasm
into Australian economics, dwelt for years
on the shores of Cope Cope, an unboomed
Victorian lake which awaits the tourist in
the St. Arnaud district. A daughter is
married to Mr. Huber, a young man who
fills a post at Federal Parliament House.
Mrs. Lesley Murdoch, a Tasmanian girl,
while wandering abroad with her husband,
visited the great exhibition at Amsterdam!
tehe says Australia was well represented by
products and photographs, but the only
printed thing that wasn’t in English was the
signboard. That is the spacious sort of mis-
take that takes the profit out of advertising.
Getting a vaccination passport is a long
undertaking for the would-be traveller whose
arm refuses to “take.” Henry Harper has
been waiting for weeks to get away to
Queensland on the firm’s business. The
first injections were declared futile after 10
or 12 days. The second likewise drew a
blank Now he is waiting for the climax of
Hie third. If his FU’m doesn’t surprise him
by erupting he will get a certificate of
immunity,” but if it does erupt he will
wait a while to see how much it matters.
“Matters” seems the right word in such a
case.
Guide Carlisle, of Mount Buffalo, is dead.
He it was who built the beginnings of the
present Hospice, 18 long years before the
road was made. He carted all the timber
and stones to the bleak heights on plodding
psckhorses. That was nearly 30 years ago,
and he had to wait a long, long time for the
place to become a tourist resort. But, after
all, a man can’t do much better than pin
his faith to a good mountain.
Mrs. Harvey Patterson (she was an ex-
pert with the foils previous to her marriage)
is departing to Maoriland with her husband.
They have bought a place 20 miles out of
Christchurch on the beautiful Canterbury
Plains, and will have a stable for race-
horses close to the home. The departure
has made a hole in a fashionable city flat-
tery. They managed to occupy 14 "rooms
with the help of their servants; and if 14
vacant rooms aren’t a blank, I don’t know
what is.
The W. J. T. Clarke family are off to
England in two detachments. The head of
the house will pilot the elder girls through
America, whilst Mamma personally con-
ducts the younger ones “Homeward” along
the Suez track. The Clarke matron is
always known, amongst the Most Intimate
People, as “Queen Mary” ; and I have not
heard of any edict prohibiting the familiar-
ity. There is a certain facial resemblance
to George’s consort, which is greatly assisted
by a careful similarity of chiffons.
The George Chirnside matron, having
aired her South Yarra house sufficiently, is
once more looking out the mummy-wraps
for the furniture. In October, or there-
abouts, she will take daughter Audrey back
to England.
Mrs. Dudley Trenchard’s Glaciarium acci-
dent, whereby she broke her leg, has not
altogether crushed the spirit of gaiety in
the “Reuter” Collins family circle to which
she belongs. They have been cheered up by
the news that soldier-son Percy, the family’s
baby boy, is coming home to spend his fur-
lough.
The Children’s Hospital is unfolding a
new wing for the shelter of sick babies who
need surgical attention. Society has been
invited to attend this week-end and watch
G.-G. Denman turn the key. The new ward
has been built with an Edward Wilson
bequest.
The Co-operative Craft Workers’ Depot is
to open this week, in the Centreway. The
originators of the scheme have been "hard at
work for some time, and reckon they have
evolved an organisation which will keep the
thing going. Certainly, Melbourne ought to
have enough people prepared to pay respect-
able prices for high-class art and craftman-
ship.
People in trade know all about it by this,
but the fashionable friends of the lady have
not heard the story. The lady is the wife
of a Melbourne luminary with whom eco-
nomy is a passion ; but in spite of that she
has a reputation for indulgence in tasteful
and simple but expensive hats. The repu-
tation has been gained easily and cheaply.
Mrs. Blank buys a hat of her own designing
for two guineas from the smart milliner, on
condition that the tradeswoman will leave
the modest tile in her window for a few
days marked “£l5 155.” or thereabout.
The ministering angels who float round
in caps and cloaks have decided to possess
an institution of their very own. It is to
be called the Trained Nurses’ Club, and, be-
sides being residential, will be a central
bureau for nursing members who are waiting
for “cases.” There are 14 “Nurses’ Homes”
in Melbourne; but they are run on plain
boarding-house lines by dear old Private En-
terprise, and the ministering angels mostly
complain that their financial wings are
clipped too close. Miss Conyers, of Kew, as
the secretary of the new institution, is eager
to find and welcome supporters.
The yachtsmen danced in the St. Kilda
Town Hall one night last week. Some of
the accessories of the unstable sea were
scattered round just to give the function a
distinctive look. A tiller (or it may have
been a binnacle) sat on the dais, and when
the girls weren’t dancing, the dashing fel-
lows told them how, when the wind blows
harder than usual, they have to pour whisky
on the troubled mariners.
A young Englishman and a daughter of
one of our “best” families are a trifle down-
hearted, because the damsel’s mamma in-
sists that the course of true love shall be
obstructed, what time she takes the girl to
England and makes Enquiries.
Mrs. Rubber Edwards and her husband
have bounced across the United States.
When last heard of they were located in
New York, in a 19-storey hut which crouches
at the foot of a 53-storey giant. Anyone
who was thrown from the top of it would
probably bounce right into the Atlantic and
be lost for ever to Society.
There are many roads to success. Old
Tom Brassey, distributing prizes at an Eng-
lish school lately, told how his son-in-law,
Lord Willingdon (who was Freeman-Thomas
in Melbourne), owed much of his success
in life to his proficiency in cricket, lawn
tennis and other games. As a Lord-in-wait-
ing, Freeman-Thomas was a favorite partner
with the King in lawn tennis—and to-day
he is Governor of Bombay. He is a lord
still, but he doesn’t wait.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
A benefit race meeting was given to Mr. Hughes,
ex-handicapper, at Victoria Park on Saturday. See-
ing that the beneficiary has been working for the
racing public for 36 years, the attendance might
have been better. Still, it is hoped that the com-
plimentary cheque will be worth about £7OO. The
Governor turned up, and there was an aide or two
to preserve him from destruction. Among those on
the lawn were the Crozier clan, Mrs. Allan McFar-
lane and Mrs. Allan Bowman, Mrs. Stanley Murray
and her sister, Mrs. Herbert Rymill, Mrs. Ralli,
Mrs. Dudley Turner and Miss Turner, Mrs. Julian
Ayers, Miss Madge and Miss Jean Stirling, Mrs. Evan
Kyflin Thomas and Mrs. R. E. H. Hope. The out-
ward garb of all these folks consisted of coats, skirts,
furs and spiked hats, garments concerning which it
is difficult, if not impossible, to grow really lyric.
Mrs. Arthur Rymill gave a dance on Thursday
evening at the house of her mother, Mrs. William
Campbell, and on Wednesday a committee did as
nearly likewise as possible at the North Adelaide
Institute. Both were complete successes. Anyhow,
no protests have been lodged to date. On the same
festive evening, in the Masonic Hall nearby, the girls
of a fashionable suburban school were having their
dance —so you see Tynte-street was about as giddy
as it has been for months. By the way, the more
or less immemorial custom at the North Adelaide
Institute of “sitting out” dances in motor-cars has
been fatally bounded upon by the large, unromantic
hoof of authority. It appears that motor-cars may
not remain unattended in a public thoroughfare for
more than five hours. What is five hours when a
nice young man and an equally nice young woman
are sharing a dark, comfortable motor-car? And
what is the good of a car in these circumstances,
when an officious chauffeur is hanging around? How-
ever, chauffeur there must be; for at a recent
smart dance in the Institute, a policeman or some-
thing else equally horrible took the names and ad-
dresses of all occupants of street-anchored cars, with
a view to “proceedings.” We are all agog to know
the identity of the criminals. Meanwhile, the abat-
toirs muddle remains as involved as ever, and various
other civic anomalies and disgraces are receiving
their customary lack of attention.
Mrs. Lea, who goes back to Robe next week, gave
a tea at the Queen Adelaide Club on Thursdav.
Almond blossom and violets were in huge bowls
about the room and on the tea tables. Miss Lea, in
a smartly-built brown coat and skirt, helped her
mother to receive her guests, among whom were Mrs.
J. W. Lea (in prey, with an affrighted elust Pr
plumes in her hat), Miss Williams, Mrs. Halcomh

More cheerful results of the Sydney con-

THE FOLICY PARTLY REVEAL ED.

Bruce Smith threatens to go down in his-
tory as “The Great Decliner.” At various
times he has declined almost every honor
that could be laid upon him. He has twice
declined to be Speaker of the House of Reps,
—once the other day and once four years
ago. He declined a judgeship from Hairy
Parkes; he turned down an offer of the
Agent-Generalship ; and he rejected the offer
of a title. And his reason for these whole-
sale refusals was that he might be free to
fight on the floor of the House for the people
and the country. It is magnificent. It is
sublime. The only fly in the ointment is
that, after making so many sacrifices to be
free on the floor of the House, Bruce Smith
is so seldom there.
Once more Private Enterprise has inti-
mated that it doesn’t think much of any
sort of Private Enterprise except its own.
Hitherto the big Mount Morgan co. has de-
pended on outside Private Enterprise for its
coal, coke, engineering, timber, and other
supplies. Now it has decided that that is
an old-fashioned and frayed-at-the-edges
idea, and it is going to adopt the Socialistic
plan of being its own coal-miner and brick-
maker, and coke manufacturer, and lime-
burner, and engineer and timber miller.
The sanguine folk who built on a strong
Maoriland Labor party emerging from the
“Unity” conference, engineered by the “Red”
Federation, have spent the last few days
interring their hopes. The narrow majority
(14) by which the “Red” preamble was
rejected was a poor augury for a practical,
commonsense programme, and all chance of
such disappeared when, a few days later,
the spirit of the preamble was torn to
shreds—if spirits can be shredded. Despite
the cheers called for Unity by Mills, of Mil-
waukee, the railway delegates drew out,
followed by Fowlds, McLaren, and lesser
fry. Thereafter all amendments were
brushed aside, and with the stock phrases,
“class war,” “military tyranny” etc., the
“Red” platform went through. But the
Massey Government still survives; in fact,
the only damage so far has fallen on the
original trades and labor party, and pre-
parations for repairs are already in train.
Mills counts nothing.
The chief change brought by the new Par-
liamentary session in South Aus. is the
retirement of John Verran from the leader-
ship of the Opposition in favor of Crawford
Vaughan. Opponents tried to make capital
out of supposed dissensions in the Labor
ranks, but the transfer was conducted amic-
ably enough at the last. It is probably for
the good of the party. There is no obvious
reason at all why Labor should “wowse,”
but under Verran it was always liable to do
so at any moment, and a big section of the
party has been driven nearly frantic by
being dragged into partnership with the
anti-everything-cheerful fanatics. More-
over, Verran showed himself weak when
strikers took possession of Adelaide traffic
two years ago. Nothing but his bluff man-
ner and sterling honesty ever got him the
leadership, for which he was eminently un-
suited. Vaughan is a different type alto-
gether. Son of the chief Government photo,
lithographer, he has been well educated, and
has a sense of the fitness of things.
Whether he can lead remains to be seen;
but he is shrewd and cautious, has a fierv
eloquence rather of the Welsh type, and
has had experience of office as State Treas-
urer. Small-built, clean-shaved, and 40, he
has a clever wife, and a brother who is likely
to be the next S.A. Attorney-General.
“We are not interfering
with the maternity bonus,”
said Mr. Cook. “What we
propose to do is to abolish
the bangle bonus. What I
mean is tliat rich women
are not to get the money.”
What Mr. Cook really
means is that the woman
who isn’t rich is only to get
the money on condition that
she admits poverty, and in-
terviews a set of sour
officials, pulling a poor
mouth, and exulaining that
in having a child she has
gone beyond her means, and
must go on the parish to
the extent of £5. In which
circumstances, how many
Australian women will ap-
ply? What Mr. Cook means
is that he is going to knock
the initial letter out of the bonus, and leave
only the onus.
Someone asserts that P.M.G. Wynne’s
horse-racing colors have been introduced in
the new “loyal” Commonwealth stamp, from
which the purely Australian kangaroo has
been ejected like a non-paying lodger. The
Cook Stakes is not likely to be a long-dis-
tance event, and the P.M.G., in his des-
perate sprint, is evidently determined to
make every post a Wynning post.
The heart of Cofif’s Harbor was made
glad lately by the tabling of a report from
the N.S.W. Public Works Committee re-
commending harbor works there at a cost
of £190,000. Charles Oliveu as chairman
of the Decentralisation Commission, gave
Coif’s the glad eye; and Johnson, of the
Railways, is among its friends. Naturally
it isn’t to be compared with Port Stephens;
but Port Stephens is too far south to serve
the whole of the North Coast, and, anyway,
there is room and more for two good port's
between Sydney and Brisbane. But before
Coif’s comes into its full inheritance there
will have to be a line from Inverell to
Guyra, connecting thence with the line at
Dorrigo on to Glenreagh and the coast.
With that big work done trade will flow
down from back as far as Mungindi, and
then the man who now can’t get his wheat
shifted because the railways are busy haul-
ing other men’s goods over vast, unneces-
sary distances will take a few steps further
from the Bankruptcy Court.
McLeod, the elect of poor old Daylesford
in Vic. Assembly, figures now as the “double-
dyed traitor” of the House. He betrayed
the Liberal cause by scheming a Tory-Labor
combination to push the Watt Ministry out
of omce, and then he betrayed the Labor
party by backing down from his position
and crawling to his Tory corner again. Even
long-suffering Daylesford must have had just
about enough of McLeod. Last week he
decided to retire peaceably from his seat in
the local borough council on the ground that
his Parliamentary duties kept him too busy.
After next election those duties will cease to
keep him warm if a reasonably strong can-
didate runs against him.
If the just-concluded Westralian Labor
Congress has its way, much good blood will
be shut out of the Commonwealth and many
a strong shooting-arm lost. Taking a very
narrow view of things, it passed a resolu-
tion to the effect that non-English speakers
should not be employed in any industry.
There are reasons why the Dago miner who
can’t warn his English mates of a misfire
should be shut out of Australian mines, but
there is no reason why the white foreigner
who has not yet learned English should be
shut out of all Australian callings. The
Commonwealth could very well do with a
million such people as the German farmers
who have settled and thrived and become
first-rate colonists in South Australia. If
the Jap. comes, armed and angry, 200,000
strong, incapable of speaking English, but
quite able to shoot in his own language, this
country may be glad to have on its side any
strong, resolute and really white man who
can shoot in any white man’s language —
German, Danish, French, Swedish or even
broad Scotch. Quite a lot of good shooting
has been done in very unintelligible Scotch.
ACID AND ICE.
Richard Jebb’s delicate tribute to the
“Party Government’’ fetich, in his book,
“The Britannic Question” :
In Britain the whole political system depends now-
aday on the Conservative and Liberal machines. Its
life-blood is the secret party funds, which are care-
fully guarded against any attempt to enact pu -
U u l Swn‘„lSg«, l w2Tb P ,S
the scenes, contribute not only largely but regularly
to one or the other war-chest, and the withdrawal of
whose support would cripple the operations of the
party machine.... “Who pays the piper calls the
tune” is an axiom which, in proportion as party
organisation becomes more expensive, must have an
increasing application to the determination of party
politics.
In fact, Britannia s wheel is nowadays a
surreptitious sovereign.
The old gag concerning the “pap-fed” in-
dustry of growing sugar with white labor
will have to be given a rest at last; for the
“white” bounty came to an end in July,
As a matter of fact, there never was a
bounty in the ordinary sense. What hap-
pened was that the sugar-producer paid an
excise of 4s. per cwt.—a charge which would
have sent the wheat-farmer raving mad if
it had been applied to flour as well as sugar
—and the “bounty” was merely a remission
of the duty. The sugar-grower now knows
better where he is: there is no excise and
no “bounty,” and the only help he gets is
by way of a £6 per ton protection against
the grower who hires Javanese and other
nigger labor at 6d. a day and thereabouts.
An elevating incident of last week’s crisis
debate in the Vic. Assembly was the speech of
—haw !—Norman Ba.vles, member for Toorak,
denving his alleged desire to get into
a Ministry— any Ministry. Bayles railed at
Watt from a lofty social standooint. and
put on “dog,” regardless of offence. Gazing
haughtily at his political chief he said: “I
ask the Premier not to bring his usual North
Melbourne manners with him,” and then
went on to tell him: “You have to live up to
the standards of gentlemen, whose standards
are very much higher than yours. You have
to follow in the footsteps of men who be-
haved with a sense of the dignity of their
positions.” The real trouble with Watt,
so far as Norman Bayles is concerned,
seems to be that he can’t live up to a sense
of the dignity of Norman Bayles’s position
as member for Toorak.
THE CLEAN SHEET
With the scrutiny of the Beallarat Federal rolls
concluded, It is stated that the scrutiny has disclosed
nothing serious.
The same results are being obtained in other elec-
torates.
THE LIB. : “ Disgraceful, I call it! Why, the
infernal scoundrels are innocent, mum!”
When Premier Watt lately returned to
Melbourne from England, he said that “he
had been imbued with a new spirit of appre-
ciation of the Empire.” When he was in
London he said that he was struck by that
city’s “appalling and ghastly slums.” Evi-
dently there are two sides to Watt’s new
spirit of appreciation—a side that swells
with pride, and a side that shudders with
horror.
The other day the Argus set out to ex-
plain what a beautiful thing progress was,
and instanced Hamilton (Vic.), in the dis-
trict haunted by the big Western squatters.
Well, here is Hamilton’s record :
1898. 1913.
Population . . .. . . 3650 4900
Annual value of property .. £23,307 £33,507
Heaven save us from much of such furious
progress as that!
N. S. Wales Liberals are running a set
of doubles for the Sydney suburban seats of
Glebe and Enmore at the coming State elec-
tion. Dr. Otto Bohrsmann has been selected
to contest the former; and his brother, Dr.
Rudolph Bohrsmann, will carry the flag in
the latter. The Glebe seat was a squattage
for ex-Minister Jimmy Hogue until 1910,
when he was flooded out by a storm of en-
lightenment. Enmore is a brand new elec-
torate.
When South Aus. turned down the first
Referenda, in 1911, Peake, the then leader
of the Opposition, thought that Verran and
his Ministry should at once resign. He
said that the majority of Noes showed a
want of confidence in the Government, and
no self-respecting Ministry could remain in
office in the face of the reverse. Now Peake
sits in the place where Verran sat, the
Referenda proposals have been carried in
S.A., and the Labor party gently reminds
Peake of his 1911 speech. But Peake
simply smiles —and that smile illustrates
once more the hollowness of these magnifi-
cent party diatribes.
Another slander by the “Liberal” leaders
on those Australians who are opposed to
them politically has been blighted. After
the Federal elections there was a howl from
Macedonia, or Toryville, or somewhere, that
Labor had won seats by means of double
voting, and the Electoral Department was
ordered to moil at high pressure in order to
uncover the disgraceful doings of the —ah —
Labah mob. To date, the officers have
checked the rolls of 44 electorates out of 75
and ascertained that the average number of
double votes polled was about three per
1000. Allowing a reasonable margin for
mistakes by electors and poll clerks, the num-
ber of actual double votes was practically
nil; far too few, at any rate, to justify the
charges of corruption, to say nothing .of de-
composition and putrefaction. So far, no
apology has been forthcoming—naturally.
Having been informed by Joe Cook that
the navy’s “River” vessels were a species of
dinghy used in the navigation of creeks (on
the same principle the Shire liners are ves-
sels that trade between Hampshire and
Devonshire), _ Australia has now begun to
get valuable information from the same en-
lightened party about natural phenomena.
During his tour with Irvine, the Prime Min-
ister. according to the Argus, had this to
say at Wedderburn :
Mr. McDonald, the late Speaker, had employed
an unhappy metaphor in likening the work of the
Labor party to an earthquake. Perhaps Mr. McDon-
ald did not know how an earthquake did work.
First of all, it poured over the whole face of the
country streams of molten lava and buried every-
thing before it. It buried men and homes and insti-
tutions under its devastating flow. (Cheers.)
Next time Cook speaks he might tell us
what a volcano is. As likely as not he will
assure us that it is a narrow neck of water
entirely surrounded by sea-serpents.
UNIFORM DIVERSITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Cook Government has promised a Scotch mix-
ture in Melbourne that the Scottish kilt shall be re-
stored at the earliest opportunity as a uniform for
Australian soldiers.
In other lands are sons content
To be of their peculiar race;
But on this hapless continent
It seems that may not be the case.
Here any dashed old thing we’ll be
But what we are, if we can brook
The maddening perversity
Of Satan, Irvine and Jo Cook—
The trio bright
Who never fight
For poor Australia, wrong or right.
Since Sandy is to have his kilt,
His philabeg and other gear,
And march to where the blood is spilt
With bagpipes wailing in his ear,
Why shouldn’t Pat to battle go
Dressed like the son of Erin’s Isle
Staged by the elder Boucicault,
And Cockneys garbed in coster style
Lay down their lives
For hearths and wives
When foemen threaten us with gyves?
The Austral army marches past,
A motley throng in batches queer;
A clump of Scotties in the van,
A clutch of Hebrews in the rear,
And in between a thousand breeds —
Welshmen, Dagoes, Dutchmen, Chows,
Russians, Germans, French and Swedes,
In kilt, or petticoat, or blouse.
But we’ll be shot
If we can spot
A darned Australian in the lot!
VICTORIA.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The Bulletin was alone in recommend-
ing Ballista for the Australian Hurdle Race at
Caulfield, whilst suggesting that his latest previous
running was not conclusive proof of his unripeness.
Melbourne papers, without exception, ignored the
nag even as a place investment. A week earlier
the son of Carbinier and Phyl had run like one
short of work. Julian rushed past him at the end
of a two-miles hurdle at Moonee Valley, and his
chance of staying to the end of a 3i-miles go didn’t
look bright. Moreover, the stable kept Wimmera
in the race, and preferred him to Bailista on the
day, judging from market prices and touts’ talk.
Yet Ballista, starting at 10’s and 12’s to one in a
field of 11 (one of whom was a despised outsider),
won the race in record time. Wimmera made the
record pace by trying to win all the way. Until
their heads were turned for home, he looked like
staying in front, despite his burden of list. 31b.
Then Clontaft, with only 9st. 31b. to struggle under,
collared him; after that, Ballista, 9st. 71b., came
like a racehorse and won brilliantly. Wingarara,
the nearest and most dangerous of Wimmera’s pur-
suers half a mile from home, fell at the second-
last hurdle —the only member of the crowd to come
to grief. Wingarara was handicapped with a blind
eye, and it found him out when the pinch came.
The loss of half his eyesight had made him uncer-
tain in his jumping.
Ballista was expected to win the Caulfield event
last year, but he failed pretty badly through being
rushed to the front along with his impetuous mate
Wimmera, who finished second, after spoiling both
their chances.
For the Australian Steeplechase, due next
Saturday, a good many old battlers are possibilities
at time of writing. The writer takes Bullawarra,
Leah Itleshna, United Kingdom (apparently quite
recovered from his fall at Flemington), Scrutineer,
Ballista, Clontaft, Emiroo and Statecraft as the
most dangerous. Bullawarra and Ballista look par-
ticularly good chances. This vote is for Bullawarra,
the handsome son of Sir Simon, with 12st. 111 b.
against his honored name. It seems a “crushing”
weight to be carried in a four-mile steeplechase,
but some previous winners have been even more
“crushed.” Grafnax got home with 12st. 121 b. up.
Colonel Shillinski carried 13st. 21b. : Domino managed
to hump 13st. 51b. to victory; Daimio had 13st.
31b., and Redleap won easily with 13st. 121 b. up.
The writer reckons that none of these bygone cham-
pions, bar Redleap, had so much pace and strength
as Bullawarra.
In the Sydney Lacrosse competition
Eastern Suburbs got through another Saturday with-
out a defeat, and is still on top with 25 points to
Sydney’s 19 and the 15 of Petersham and Birch-
grove. Mosman has a modest dozen, while Bur-
wood, University and Manly are eight, four and four
respectively. The cup of joy was filled to the brim
for Eastern Suburbs by the lucky defeat of Peter-
sham, which has held the premiership so often.
But it was a close call. At half-time East led by
three goals to two; but, shortly after, Petersham
evened things, and later on it was four all, and
both sides going strong. Then East Sydney got a
burst of splendid luck and scored three goals in
quick succession. The dice of the gods were thrown,
and East won by seven goals to four. Mosman and
Sydney played themselves right out before time was
up, but Sydney had established a lead of two
goals, and it maintained its advantage to the end,
winning by five goals to three. In the first round
Birchgrove had stamped University flat by seven
goals to one; but when they met on Saturday the
Students made so stubborn a stand that at half-time
the score was one all. Early in the second half
Birchgrove let loose two splendidly maintained at-
tacks, and, bursting through, scored twice. Not
till just before time did Uni. manage to wipe one
off the deficit, so it went under with two to Birch-
grove’s three. Manly, which had hitherto scored
only one victory this season, smashed up Burwood
by four goals to two. How it happened no man
can tell —least of all any man who resides at
Manly.
Small-pox having scared off the Vic. and
South Aus. baseballers, the bottom fell out of the pro-
nosed inter-State carnival, and followers of the game
had to fall back on the second round of Sydney com-
petition on Saturday. Lane Cove and Mosman went for
Sydney, and looked like eating it up, but the Syd-
ney brethren in the fifth innings hit up a tally of
eight runs, and so won through by 10 to nine amidst
great excitement and bitter disappointment. Peter-
sham went home exhausted after doing Waverley by
five to four, while Burwood surprised and defeated
Leichhardt, nine runs to eight. University was out
for blood, and jumped on Paddington by 14 to two.
The semi-finals start next Saturday.
Saturday saw the start of the three com-
petitions for the Zenith Cun, the outward and visible
sign of supremacy among the auto-cyclists of N.S.W.
There were 51 entrants, of whom 45 faced the pistol
and started out for a run from Strathfield. through
Parramatta, Hornsby Gully, Bobbin Head. Turra-
murra and P.vmble, down to North Sydney Post
Office. The scenery along the run is beautiful, and
for the most part the roads were good; but there
were stretches north of Turramurra where a lot of
nice new clay had been laid. The motor-bikists
then knew exactly how a flv feels when he falls into
the honey-jar. As the handicaps were not declared
before the race it will be some days before the re-
sults are worked out. The second competition will
take place on September 16, and will be over the
Blue Mountains to Hartley, where the shale used to
come from. The final will eventuate a fortnight
later over a course that has yet to be chosen.
The eldest son of Lo’- Tennvson. who
got his early ideas of cricket in Australia when his
old man was vice-regalling at Adelaide, is now a
boss bat of the Hampshire County team.
The newly-formed Billiards Association in
Adelaide has begun work with an amateur champion-
ship. It provided some surprises, and proved that
players, like horses, run in all shapes. The various
club experts were knocked out, and the final was left
to Demodena, a fragile-looking little mandolin player,
and Cooper, a tall cricketing youth from Glenelg.
The fingl was one of the most exciting things ever
seen. At 950, with only 50 to go. Cooper led by a
hundred or so; but, then, experience or nerves or
luck, or something, came in, and Demodena got home
bv 16. It is feared that neither of them will be
able to represent the State in the forthcoming Aus-
tralian championships.
“0.K.” : The sculling championship of the
world, not a much sought-after distinction as it is,
would have lost its last vestige of glory if the con-
queror of Arnst had lost his title to Harry Pearce.
So, for the sake of what once was a matter of great
sporting interest, Barry’s defeat of the Australian
challenger can be accepted as a satisfactory result.
It leaves the opening for Arnst to have a go to
recover the championship. Barry had the bad luck
to be born SO years too late. Probably he is the
best man who ever pushed a racing skiff, but he gets
no boodle out of the game. Before he rowed Pearce
he complained that there was no “promoter” to put
up even his stake for him. He and his father had
to find the money. All things considered, the
Thames Conservancy might allow special sections of
the river bank to be reserved by speculators for a
champion boat race, and even with all the risks of
the London climate against them, they would be
game to do something in the way of guarantees for
winner and loser. Pearce and his supporters must
have paid dearly for his defeat. Boat racing is
sport, anyhow. The bloke behind the sculls doesn’t
sit on velvet. # *
Last week Richard Arnst formally chal-
lenged James Paddon, the holder of the Australian
sculling championship and the Referee Challenge
Cup, to defend his title to both baubles, lie also
includes a stake of £2OO among the items to be
raced for, and as an earnest of good faith, deposited
£25. Richard desires that the contest shall take
place on the usual course on the Parramatta River
on November 15, 1913. So far, the possession of
the championship has not brought the hefty Paddon
much cash, so he will, no doubt, be happy to oblige.
Arnst, apnarentlv, is not aware he is no longer as
young as he used to be.

The destructive progress of Balmain in
the Sydney Rugby League competition came to a
sudden end on Saturday, when that explosive team
crashed into Eastern Suburbs on Sydney Cricket
Ground. Many of the righteous and the unrighteous
had prayed hard on Saturday night and Saturday
morning that Balmain might blow up with the usual
explosion and wreck Eastern Suburbs, and during the
first half it looked as though it might happen at any
moment. Balmain was clearly boss of the situation,
and scored five points to nil. But five points is not
an explosive score. East Sydney seemed to be deadly
stale. “They’ll wake up in the second half,” said
a Balmain admirer. But Balmain didn’t. Instead,
it was Eastern Suburbs which came to life, and
scored 13, while Balmain failed to cross the line or
tilt the ball over the bar. Both sides played wretch-
edly, but Balmain’s showing in the second half was
plain horrible. South Sydney came back to its old
form, and revived wonderfully, as Glebe found to its
grief. Play had hardly started when South broke
loose, and in a few minutes had five on the scoring
board. Glebe was out-run, out-played and out-
kicked, and when half-time whistle blew, South was
leading by 12 to three. In the second half Glebe
had the aid of the wind, and made desperate attempts
to even up. But it had no hope. South played
better than ever, and scored point for point, so at
full time it won by 15 points to six. Western
Suburbs had a great battle with Newtown, and, for
a time, almost up to whistle-blow, was leading by
11 points. Then, for some inexplicable reason, the
Western team seemed to ease up. Newtown broke
loose like a swarm of devils, and with a series of
splendid charges wiped out the deficit and got a
credit balance of three points, winning by 17 to 14.
Annaridale journeyed to North Sydney, and found the
stubborn tollmen waiting in battle array. Annan-
dale astonished the natives, and itself, by the
splendid quality of its play. Its charges were
brilliant and magnificently fast and well-pressed
home. The defence work was not so good, though
some of the tackling was very deadly. But, for the
main part, it was the brilliancy and speed of the
attack which won the game. Still, when North Syd-
ney got going it was not to be denied, and it was
as close a match as is possible in a League game in
which one side wins. The baby team won by 20
points to 18, but the difference in the quality of the
play was much more than that in favor of Annan-
dale. The result of the upheaval is to maintain
Eastern Suburbs in its lead, with time and the
competition quickly running out. Eastern Suburbs
has 22 points, South Svdney 18, Newtown 17, and
Glebe 14. Glebe is now out of the hunt, along with
the clubs which follow it. They have only single-
figure scores.
•» * * *
Although the Eastern Suburbs-Balmain
League tussle was, generally, a flat, stale and unpro-
fitable sort of mix-up, it had one exciting spasm.
That was shortly before the finish, when a couple of
the opponents lay on the ground and thumped each
other very merrily to wild applause from the jaded
spectators. The most interesting matches of the
League competition now are between the teams that
have absolutely no chance of getting to the top, and
are struggling like Satan to get as far from the
bottom as possible.

The Soccer crowd got off no less than
five matches on Saturday—three for the coveted
Gardiner Gup and two for the utensil left behind by
Harry Rawson, the well-beloved. In the Gardiner
Cup disturbance, Northern Suburbs smashed up Lith-
gow by thre'e goals to one. Granville had a close
call with Canterbury, but managed to crawl out on
top with three goals to two. A club that runs riot
under the ridiculous name of Burns Anniversary made
a holv show of Balmain C team, demolishing it by
four goals to one. which is a very substantial sort
of demolition under Soccer rules. For the Rawson
Cup, Annandale" and Newtown put up a stubborn
contest, which ended in a draw (one goal each),
while Balmain crushed Sydney by two goals to nil.
Sydney is the premier Soccer team, so Balmain felt
elated. »

The Federal or Australian Competition
saw the second round completed on Saturday, an
Sydney team is atop of the heap with & 2 points.
The second place is filled by Paddington, which h
40 ; South Sydney and Newtown have each 32, North
Shore has 28, Balmain 20, and East Sydney 16.
South Sydney and Balmain have each postponed
match, but Sydney’s lead of three victories Will take
a lot of wiping out, and in any case neither South
Sydney nor Balmain can do it.
Anything more horrible than the showing
of the Queensland XV against the N.S.W. Rugby
Union’s team at the University Oval, Sydney, on
Saturday would be hard to imagine. It may
been that they had all been freshly vaccinated, but
had they been inoculated with the germ of utter
inefficiency they could not have made a worse showing.
Back machine there was none, and the forwards
looked as though they had never played together in
their lives before. During the first half the N.S.W.
team had a slight advantage from the wind, and
scored 14 points to nil. When the change of ends
came Queensland showed a slight flash in the pan,
and scored. But it was only a flash. The fire died
down as quickly as it had flamed up, and while
Queensland scored six points N.S.W. piled up 12, in
spite of the handicap of the wind, and finally won by
26 points to six. The thing is inexplicable.

The only Vic. League game which counted
on Saturday proved the most exciting of the season.
It was between St. Kilda and Carlton. The latter
was fourth on the list and half a game ahead of the
Saints. By concerted play and high speed the
Saints held their own and a bit over till the inter-
val, when the tally was Saints 41 points and Carlton
19. On resuming, drier conditions suited Carlton
better, and it started to reduce its deficit, to the
joy of its share of the 25,000 barrackers, who began
to “chat.” But there was no dropping of the
Saints’ bundle, and at lemon-time that crowd was
still six points ahead, 50 to 44. The last term
was a tremendous struggle. The Saints worked
methodically and secured a goal, and then another
and two behinds, and the game seemed safe. But
the Blues came again and piled up four goals and a
behind, and thereby won a lead of five points. The
minutes were hasting to the limit as the Saints
charged for the last time, and in a scrimmage in
front of the goal a Saint was slung bv the neck.
As he placed the ball the bell rang, but he was
entitled to his kick, and he drove it straight and
well, and won the game by a single point. Carlton
had dropped to fifth on the list; St. Kilda is
among the four for the present, but it has yet to
meet ’Wood, among others, and anything may hap-
pen. In the other disturbances South beat Mel-
bourne by 48 points to 19 ; Geelong Essendon by
76 to 53; ’Rov Richmond by 79 to 46; and
’Wood Uni. bv 'B7 to 70.
* * * *
The position in the Ass. is still more or less
open, though it looks as if North, ’Scray, ’Don and
’Wick would be “the four,” P’ran’s chance having
been largely discounted by its walloping on Satur-
day at the feet of North, which inconsiderate com-
bination put together 54 points to P’ran’s 44. The
latter might have had a hope of winning had it made
some slight effort to score, or at least to effectively
defend during the first quarter, when North heaped
up 39 points to nil. That sort of disaster breaks a
team’s heart, and it rarely pulls level again. For
the rest, Brighton succumbed to Essendon, with 52
points to 86; Northcote to Brunswick, 74 points to
116 ; Port to ’Town, 48 points to 54; and the
Melb. Citizens serenely accepted their usual trounc-
ing, scoring 20 points to ’Scray’s 54.
When America trampled on Australasia
in the first round of the Davis Cup, it looked as
though nothing could stop them winning the chal-
lenge round against England. And nothing did.
England relied on Parke, Dixon and Roper Barrett;
America on McLoughlin, Hackett and Williams.
McLoughlin was, of course, mainly responsible—
helped by Dixon, who struck the shocking form he
showed here, and served 13 “doubles” in his match
with Williams. On the first day Parke beat
McLoughlin 3 sets to 2, although the American won
30 games to 29, and Williams beat Dixon after five
sets, 25 games all. In the doubles Dixon and
Barrett were within one stroke of the match; but
the Yankees took the match 3 sets to 2, 26 games to
23. England thus had to win both singles to keep
the Cup; but when McLoughlin beat Dixon three
straight sets England was sent for, and the U.S.A.
had the Cup. Parke and Williams played their set,
and the Irishman won after five sets. Thus does
America for the first time since 1902 take the trophy
home. The Davis Cup matches started in 1900. and
results since then have been: England 5
wins, Australasia 4, America 3. No matches were
played in 1901 and 1910. South Africa, France,
Germany, Canada, Belgium and Austria have all
tried and failed.
Jules Goux, the dapper little French
motorist who won £4OOO by getting home first in
the great International Motor Speed Contest at
Indianapolis (U.S.A.) some time ago, gave many
interesting particulars of the race to the Motor
Magazine. If Jules wrote the yarn himself, then
lie is a descriptive artist of parts. But the Chances
are he didn’t; it was probably the work of a
“ghost.” The course was miles in circuit, with
a bricked surface, which by mid-day was almost red
hot. Around it were over 100,000 people looking
down from grandstands and seats, and 30,000 seated
in closely-packed automobiles. Never before had
Jules Goux gazed upon such an ocean of faces. The
track was so narrow that for the start the 27 cars
had to be ranged in four lines. Had they been
allowed to start at full blast there would have been
an instant mix-up, so the President of the Circuit
took them off in his roadster ear, starting dead
slow, and accelerating his pace till they were nicely
strung out. Then he slipped off into a side track
and left them to it. The noise was deafening, for
all that vast mass of humanity was howling and
cheering, waving flags, and blowing trumpets. Oars
sufficient to hold 30,000 people tooted their horns,
and stowed away among the 80 grandstands were
four military bands making more row. On top of
it all was the roar and clatter of 27 high-powered
cars thundering over the bricks.
The Yankee drivers had drenched their machines
in lubricating oil, and when the cars got
hot this went off in dense clouds of smoke, which
obscured the track, along which the cars thun-
flered sometimes at 90 miles an hour. The effect ot
that maelstrom of sound on the drivers was to
duce a fearful exaltation. They became to them-
selves like gods, and reckless unto madness. Onlv
bv the greatest efforts could they bring themselves
to exercise the slightest caution. When tyres gave
out and tanks ran drv they pulled off, but onlv be-
cause their speed-making powers were interfered
with All were possessed with the one idea, to get
a break on the field with one tremendous dash and
so dishearten those behind, and the contest be-
came terrific as they bounded madlv past each other
through the clouds of drifting, rolling smoke. Goux
was lucky, and got to the front early, and owing to
careful handling his tyres lasted longer than those
of the majority. When he had to haul off to replace
those on his back wheel he lost a minute, but was
still to the good except for the car driven bv the
dare-devil Burman, the . Yankee motor “speed-king,’
who would not be shaken off. The famous driver,
Zuccarelli, had horrible luck; his petrol pipe broke
and he roared along in flames, a fearful sight., till he
could get out of the ruck and haul clear. By which
time he was getting rather scorched. No matter
what speed Goux soared up to, Burrnan was always
just on his wheel. But the car was unequal to the
strain and developed mechanical troubles, and the
gallant Burrnan had to retire —beaten by his makers.
The heat was terrific; whenever his car stopped
to replace tyres or refill the tanks, Goux had a
gallon of water poured over his head, only to find
it dry as a bone five minutes later. With Burman's
retirement serious opposition ended, and Goux won
with comparative ease. He was amazed at the finish
when the Yankees gave him a splendid ovation for
beating their own champion.
N.S.W. League of Wheelmen has ukased
that the Tamworth-Newcastle Dunlop Road Race shall
be run off on Saturday, September 20. Intending

“Young Nipper,” the victor of 200 fights
out of a total of 375, mostly per medium of the
order of the knock, made his Sydney debut on Satur-
day night at the Stadium, his opponent being Sidney
Burns. The two had met before in England several
times. Nipper was lOst. and Burns 4oz.
heavier. As usual, the heavier man won. Nipper
is certainly a mighty smiter, a fact that Burns
seemed to be particularly alive to, for he avoided
the wallops whenever possible with a loathing that
suggested they were charged with small-pox or dyna-
mite. He boxed beautifully and stalled off Nipper’s
frantic attentions with a very pretty straight left
against which Nipper dashed his nose in vain. On
that fist the nose could make no impression. Nipper
was not in condition ; he had got into the ring too
soon after his arrival, and after the ninth he was
cold pig. But he was still dangerous, and Burns,
after a few sharp shocks, decided it was not good
enough to go monkeying around for a knock-out
when he had a sure win on points; so he contented
his soul with very prettily out-boxing his exhausted
opponent. In the last round he took a few chances
and floored Nipper twice, but that young man got up,
and, although apparently almost unable to
stand, fought viciously and managed to see the thing
through. This time the referee’s job was dead easy,
and even the howling mob who are so ready to hoot
what they don’t understand did not dispute it.
Hock Keys is finding congenial work in
Maoriland. Some weeks ago he crossed the Tasman
under engagement to box Hegarty, at Wellington.
The bout resulted in a draw, although Keys reckoned
he should have been given the verdict. After that,
he was signed up for matches at Hastings (where
he easily defeated W. Hannan) and Auckland, with
good prospects of other engagements at Christchurch
and Wellington. At Auckland he will box Johnnie
Summers, the Englishman, who is paying a flying
visit to Maoriland. The chances are that Summers
will also face an opponent at Wellington before
leaving the land of the extinct moa and the active
I O U.
The A.J.C. has hit somebody very hard
with a new rule that bookmakers are not to train
their own horses after November 1 this year. Theor-
etically, of course, there is no reason why a book-
maker should not run his horses as honestly as any
punter of them all, and some bookmakers do. But
the point is that other bookmakers may arise and
run horses, not on their merits, but on the require-
ments of their book.
Bluff, ill-kempt Andrew Tennant, the S.
Aus. squatter whose death was reported last week,
was a thorough good sport. After Lady Rose had
won the Derby for him in 1891 he sold the mare to
J. H. Aldridge; but just after the sale, and before
the new owner could do anvthing with her, she was
killed. Aldridge’s cheque was, of course, forthcom-
ing ; but Tennant never presented it.

Sanatogen Brings New
Health and Nerve Force.
“ I have used Sanatogen with extra-
ordinary benefit. It is to my mind a true
food tonic, feeding the nerves, increasing
the energy, and giving fresh vigour to the
overworked body and mind.”
These words by Sir Gilbert Parker, M.P.,
the well-known author, have a helpful
meaning for you— if you need real help in
one of those crises of life when your health
is giving you anxiety.
They echo a sentiment of gratitude which
is expressed in many different ways in
thousands upon thousands of letters from
men and women who owe to Sanatogen new
strength and vitality.
The Rt. Hon. Sir John Gorst, member of His
Majesty's Privy Council, writes: “ Sir John
Gorst wishes to say he has long been acquainted
with the great merits of Sanatogen—has taken
it with excellent results, and when necessary
will certainly take it again. It was also used
by a daughter of his with great benefit.”
To you who are run down, nervous or
W eak —to you who are less than yourself —
Sanatogen will bring new health. To you
whose nerves*have gone wrong, and whose
appetite or sleep or capacity for work are
impaired, Sanatogen comes as a rescuing
sustainer, a revitalising force, a feeder of
nerves and tissues.

The Care of the Wounded.
“Old Soldier” : Duncan Johnstone’s book
of experiences of the Balkan War, “With
the British Red Cross in Turkey,” shows
What are the realities of war. What sheep
we are! We imagine that some thousands
of men armed with rifles, and all dressed
alike, and trained to make certain mechani-
cal movements in concert are an effective
army. Well, they aren’t; at any rate, it
won’t last. The Turks were supposed to be
the champion fighters of Europe, though it
was admitted they had no one with brains
worth tuppence to handle them. But they
went all to pieces before the Bulgars, and
now the Bulgars have apnarently gone to
pieces before the Greeks and Serbs. The
origin of most of the trouble is that men
have been expended too recklessly, and no
care has been taken to pick up and save
the human wreckage of the battlefield.
The Bulgars thought at first that the one
thing for them to do was to break down the
Turks by the persistence and dash of their
charges. They did it, but they had forgotten
the smallness of their population, and the
impossibility of filling up the ranks if they
were too much thinned. They failed to
provide for the adequate cere of the nrnre
slightly wounded. The Turks were just as
bad, but they had reserves of men to draw
on, and now they are threatening to turn
the tables. What should we in Australia
think if something like the following de-
scribed the state of our wounded defenders
after the first fight with an invader? —
We found that most of the wounded were from
Kirk Kilisse, three weeks earlier. Many had not been
attended to since the first field dressing after the
battle, and were almost starving. The wounds were
horrible to look at, and had grown twice their size
through neglect. They were also full of maggots
and dirt worms, which had to be scraped out with
the fingers. One man had had some wooden splinters
behind his eyes for 12 days, without any attention.
The smell in the hospital was dreadful.
That seems more than sufficiently horrible
when you remember how necessary it is that
wounds should be promptly attended to if
the patients are to have a chance of re-
covery. Here is what was seen when a
second convoy of wounded came a day or
two later: —
The wounded were all in a terrible condition. 1
can remember one man who had a huge, jagged hole
in his shoulder, and, on examination, we found the
ring of a shell fastened on to the shoulder bone,
between it and the socket. The wound all round
was discolored, and full of pus ; there were also the
inevitable maggots caused by dirt, and altogether the
sight was most loathsome. Another, who lingered
on in great agony for a few days, had no back to
his head, which was all crushed in. I cannot make
out how thev survived the journey from the front.
The old soldiers among us said the sights were far
worse than any they had seen during the South
African War.
The time is coming when it will be neces-
sary to organise the military forces of Aus-
tralia for war. It would be madness to wait
till the invasion actually comes before doing
it It will be too late then, because all the
reasonably competent organisers will have
their time more than fully occupied in get-
ting ready the fightin" machinery, and will
not be able to so much as think of the pro-
vision of food, forage, baggage and supply
waggons, let alone lint, medicines, disinfect-
ants, and instruments —not to speak of
doctors, hospital orderlies, and, most im-
portant of all, stretchers, ambulance wag-
gons for the road, and hospital trains for
the railways. If Australia is going to pre-
pare in earnest to defend itself, it must
make sure that losses in battle shall be mini-
mised by ensuring the greatest possible pro-
portion of recoveries among the wounded,
and that can onlv be done by having a
thoroughly efficient medical and ambulance
service prepared in peace.
♦
“Drivefast” on the stoppage of a leak: —
Speaking after seven years’ English and eight
years’ Australian experience of the motor trade, I
have no hesitation in saying that “10-2-4’s” idea
(B. 3/7/T3) of bringing out parts and assembling
cars here is scarcely worth troubling about, for two
excellent reasons. First, no maker of any standing
at all would supply a chassis not erected. Just as
much skill and experience are required to erect a
chassis so that it will give satisfactory results as
to make the parts in the first place; in fact, half the
battle in the turning out of a first-class machine
lies in careful erecuon and testing. Some makers
of cars go so far as to even refuse to supply any
car without the body complete, in order to prevent
a fool-builder this end fitting a bigger body than
the chassis was designed to carry, thereby injuring
the maker’s reputation in the long run. In the
second place, any chump who is careful can build
a cycle successfully, but there are no men to speak
of in Australia with the necessary experience to
take on chassis-building. The game calls for special
technical knowledge, gained only by years of work.
The remedy for tfie present importing craze is
to take a leaf out of America’s book and put on a
big duty—say 30 per cent, the first year, rising to
50 per cent, afterwards. The big output in the
Commonwealth is sufficient to keep three or four
factories going. The result of this policy would be
that the firms with a big hold on the Australian
market —Talbot (easy first), Star, Renault and Ford
—would establish works in Australia, sending out
nucleus staffs to start things. An annual output of
200 to 300 cars for the high-grade machine, and
say, 1000 for the cheap American type, would keep
these factories going, and enable the machines to be
sold here at the same prices as at present, or even
less, and the millions per annum spent in cars would
stop in the country that wants the work and the
money badly. Fat could still ride in his “im-
pawted” machine and pay through the nose for it;
but the average man would favor the Australian
) article every time. And the ability to obtain parts
in three days from the factory would be a tremen-
dous selling argument even in the case of Fat and
in spite of his penchant for foreign goods.
“Bookware”: There is much Melbourne
newspaper discussion just now on education.
One correspondent pitches into teaching nur-
sery stories to the young. “A pack of lies !”
says he. Without perhaps knowing it, he is
exactly the Bounderby of Dickens’s “Hard
Times.” Says Bounderby to the school-
master: “Facts, Mr. Gradgrind. Facts!”
Lady Somerset lately raised this note in
England. Says she: “There has been alto-
gether too much of this nursery-fable non-
sense. Filling little heads, addling little
brains with rubbish ! Teach them something
useful. What use is there in ‘Mother Goose,’
Aladdin,’ ‘Goodv Two Shoes,’ ‘Jack the Giant
Killer,’ and all that stuff?” Lady Warwick
rushed to the defence, with all the indigna-
tion of Dickens against Bounderby and
Gradgrind. She said: “The imagination,
according to Napoleon, rules the world. I
contend that it is the grandest quality to be
cultivated in young time. All the nursery
fables are parables, with profound morals,
or they would not be vital. See what an
unhappy stuffed little monster John Stuart
Mill was made by his father. The wretched
little chap, for he was actually wretched,
read Homer in the Greek at eight years old .
lie tells you in his autobiography how
Wordsworth saved him. He had become
like Mark Twain’s Jumping Frog, full ot
small shot. I thank Heaven for Jack ana
the Beanstalk,’ and ‘Rip Van V) inkle, and
‘Peter Pan,’ and ‘The Blue Bird.’
From a laborer in the vineyard :
Anglicans in Australia are beginning to interest
themselves in social questions, and there are sjffus
that the old-time starchiness is getting limp. Mel-
bourne took the lead with a Social Questions Com-
mittee, on which L. V. Biggs, a Parliamentary hand
of the Age, who is (or was) a suburban municipal
light in his spare time, was prominent. Courses of
sermons and lectures on “Social Sins” last year, in
which parsons and medicoes collaborated, drew a good
deal of attention —especially the doctors’ remarks on
the “Red Plague” (syphilis) and “Race Suicide.
A course on “Social Diseases” this year cut less ice,
even though “The Sacredness of Sex” was advertised
as one subject. Adelaide Anglicans got busy shortly
afterwards, and arranged lectures on such topics as
“Housing Reform” and “Town Planning”—on which
Adelaide thinks, with some justice, that it knows a
th ; ng or two. Another set of sermons begins in
Adelaide this month (August) on “The Stewardship
of Life’s Values.” As Australia is almost the only
country in the world whose rich men, speaking
generally, do nothing for the community which gives
them- their wealth, these sermons may hit the tar-
get. Sydney, not to be left too far behind, is coming
in with six lectures on “The Social Problem.” After
one on the development of capitalism comes a second
on the development of the Labor party, by Rev. C.
E. Curtis, who is shepherding now in a Sydney sub-
urb. Curtis is High Church and a Socialist, neither
of which qualifications tends to make him more
popular in ruling church circles. Some years ago
he was a parson at Narrabri (N.S.W.) when George
Reid was pursuing his famous Anti-Sosh tiger. So
wild did Curtis get at George’s farrago of tarra-
diddles that he hired a local hall and replied to the
Dry Dog’s master. Subsequently., he was in charge
of a mission to navvies on the North Coast railway.
After he had been there awhile, the “eminent busi-
ness men” who were on the council of the diocese
observed that no cash was coming in, and they wrote
asking Curtis what he was doing with the collec-
tions. He replied that he hadn’t had any collec-
tions, and didn’t intend to have any ; and now some-
one else has been sent to chase Bill and Jim for the
infrequent thrum.
“Henry Horsecollar” writes ;
It is a feature of the row raised in the name of
“Protestantism” against Irish Home Rule that a
very large section of the Church of England furi-
ously denies that it is Protestant. Certainly it
didn’t join in Luther’s famous Protest; it had very
little use for Luther; and it kept very far aloof
from many Lutheran ideas. It is far more aristo-
cratic than the Roman Church, for its visible head
is an hereditary monarch, while Popes are elective,
and, as often as not, come of very humble families.
One recent Pope had a brother who was a postman.
The Anglican Church claims to have preserved the
regular line of bishops from St. Peter onward, and
to have inherited the apostolical succession from the
Church of Rome. William 111. certainly was a
Protestant. He was a Calvinist who believed in
predestination and the damnation of such infants as
were not “elect.” The Georges were Protestants of
the old German school, with which Luther was
identified. But the Established Church of England,
over which they ruled, always hovered between two
opinions, and hung on hard to its apostolical sue-
cession. To a large section of Presbyterians and
Nonconformists it is Roman. To almost all Roman
Catholics it isn’t Roman. It is a picturesque and
dignified institution, but indefinite. Also, it is
mixed Some of it still believes in transubstantiation,
confession, the celibacy of the clergy—in fact, some
of it is as Roman as it can be without losing its
billet. (Incidentally, Queen Elizabeth, who has long
been held up as a champion of Protestantism, used
to regard married ecclesiastics as persons living in
adultery, and to insult their wives as women of loose
character.) Some of it, on the other hand, looks
very much like plain Methodist. It contains wider
differences of opinion than any other Church on
earth, and is about the hardest sect to define on the
globe. The Presbyterians of Scotland, in the davs
when they sent a Presbyterian colony to the north
of Ireland, regarded the Anglican Church, of which
George V. is now the head, as an idolatrous insti-
tution born of Rome, and this point was discusse
with great anger and bloodshed for a good part of
a century. The Anglican crowd is addicted to de-
scribing its reverends as “priests,” and in its fond-
ness for archbishops and bishops and canons and
priests and curates and deacons and cathedrals and
vestments it adheres very closely to the Roman
model. In fact, it is hard to say whether George
V. is a disguised Roman Catholic or a shandygaff.
“10-2-4”: I have just finished readirv-
“Priees, Price Indexes and Cost of Living
in Australia” —a little brochure that was
“published under the authority of the Min-
ister for Home Affairs, Hon. King O’Malley,
M.P.” the other day. (The King’s capacity
for putting his name and divnity on every-
thing within reach was akin to the yearning
of Smith, the tourist, to engrave his style
and title and his address at Peckham Rye
on the Pyramids.) As light literature it
has a charm which is all its own. It is
just the sort of thing that one can imagine
Edden or Ryrie, M.P., or Onslow or West,
M.P., bearing gleefully back to the home
and reading aloud to an enraptured family
circle. Take, for example, the section
where proof is advanced that “the Method of
Price-ratios with weighting according to
Average Expenditure is practically identical
with that of Aggregate-Expenditure”—a
most valuable point to establish. Says the
author: —
We consider the case, therefore, where Aa =Bb =
etc., but y = 2x, 2 = 3x, etc. In this case the
average value of x, y, etc., will be i (N + 1)
x = E, say, N being the number of the Commodities.
Consequently we shall have for the value of the two
cubic terms: —
a( a 3 If )2j 4 N 2
2a ax IN -U(N+l)lx = and-
=6N (. ) 3 N+l 3
3 and a N
The difference, therefore, in this instance is:—
2 N-l
logH-logK=- -
3 N+l
2 3
Which is - E when N is infinite, and is only about 2%
3
2 3
short of - E when Nis 100.
3
Such points as the above must be plain to
the most bestially stuoid of political enthu-
siasts. On all sides, nowadays, one
hears thoughtful statesmen like Miller, ot
the Monaro; Dan Levy, of Darlinghurst;
W. E. Johnson M.P., and so on. eagerly
debating such questions as the Invalidity
of the Arithmetic Mean; the Effect of
Change of Regimen; the Pseudo-Continuity
of Price-indexes with Progressive Change of
Regimen, etc. And as a result they get
a line as to the reason of the sud-
den and tragic rise in the cost of the house-
hold chop that would never have
come to them but for the invaluable publi-
cation instigated by the O’Malley.

J. Parr: If the wheat-farmer can’t afford
to pay decent wages, because he has to take his pro-
duce into the world’s markets, then wheat-growing
is no good for Austi'alia. But tell us, if you are an
experienced man, whether the most successful far-
mers aren’t those who treat their workmen best.
Haven’t you one named Lord in your own district?
And have you heard of another called Brunskill in
the Riverina ?... . Jimmo: You’ve got the rhyming
faculty, but you don’t know what to do with it yet.
....Broncho George: No, Broncho; we can hold out
no hope of making it “worth your while’’ to become

purposeless ghost yarn. With all these spectres,
snakes, devils, chills, girls, beers, shadows and sun-
dries to work upon you should have produced some-

ing, patriotic verse. But, unfortunately, the gallant
muster of the untrained —the tumultuous men who
saddle the old roan horse, and take down the old
shotgun, and start with great fervor to walk or ride
to the undefended North in the day of invasion—
however heroic it may sound, is of little use. What
is wanted is the well-trained Bill or Jim who knows
exactly where to step into line, who has his uniform
on (because there is an unpleasant habit of treating
soldiers out of uniform as brigands), who gets his
up-to-date rifle and ammunition and his rations
served out to him like clockwork, and starts for the
scene of action by railway. He may not shout so
much as the voluntary or mob variety of Bill, but
when he Gets There he breaks things. There is no
mention of any well-organised medical department
or commissariat in your yarn. And Bill can’t eat
gum-leaves C.0.M1P.: Composition all right; but
matter scarcely of wide enough interest. .. .W. C.
Goode: A keener person could have seen why dozens
of outside contributors were silent during the opera-
tion of the signed-article law —though, as a matter

pars are less than one-twentieth of those who write
Abo, Social and other items. .. .Bert S.: There is
'still nothing better on that subject than Henry
George’s works. .. .R.8.M.: The story is “worthy of

THE BLACK SHEEP.
Neath the silvery beams
Of the pale moonlight
Through a mansion window crept
A desperate thief one night;
The hour was late and
All around was still
As he lowered himself down
From the window sill ;
When he emerged with plunder
A grim rifle ball
Laid him lifeless in front
Of the garden wall;
A veteran bent o’er him
With the fatal gun—-
He’d lodged a bullet in
His black-sheep son.

I love the Western wild woods
Where roams the kangaroo
I hear the little bower birds
chopping in the mountains blue
In the wild woods he is falling
And driveing on his teams
The wild ducks he is calling
On western wooded streams
He is gathering pretty shells
” And building up his bowers
He is singing in the dells
And stealing pretty flowers
On the stock route he is singing
He’s a drover in his teens
His stockwhip it is ringing
Every where it seems
Near the running tumbeling water
He acts and mimics all day long
He imitates the kuckaburras laughter
And sings the wild, birds song
He imetates the dingo and the wild dogs barking
On the phantom lakes and in the mulga trees
And the boom of the wild waves breaking

pages about snakes in the Encyclopaedia Brit-
annica. Among other things it says that: “The
solitary Xenopeltis is in several ways intermediate
between Boidae and Ilysiidae. The rest of the
snakes are supposed to have started from some
primitive, non-degenerate, therefore boa-like group,
leading by loss of the vestiges of the hind-limbs
and loss" of the coronoid bone of the man-
dible to the aglynhous or innocuous Coluridae, when
further differentiation in three new lines has
taken place.” There are many columns of that sort

Public Opinion and
Beale High-grade Pianos.
at th!lag„l d de St oftrlH Ind™ « jLj" ““ B ’“*“ e,,,!y WPW “ ed

atith' 1 Bea ' C P ?T '’T* W °" I,ighest rec ognition for their musical and lasting qualities. This is simply because
Bea e 1 lanos possess al the improvements found m the best makes of modern pianos, and, in addition, they have patent features-such as our
steel tuning system—which are not obtainable in any other pianos.
Many eminent men, in every walk in life, have recorded their appreciation of our instruments, and we give below the opinions of a few.
HERR WILHELM GANZ, one of the best-known men in the musical
world of London, played on onr pianos at the Franco-British Exhibition, and
afterwards sent us the following purely voluntary testimonial:—
“It gives me great pleasure to state that I consider the Grand Pianoforte
which you exhibited at the Franco-British Exhibition a very first-rate instru-
ment. I much enjoyed playing on the same. The touch is excellent, likewise the
tone. I especially admired the wonderful tone of the bass. In fact, I hardly
remember a pianoforte with a more resonant sound, and Australia may he very
proud of your having produced such a fine instrument. With every good wish
for your success in the production of these pianofortes, I remain, yours verv
faithfully, Wilhelm Ganz.”
(At the Fra neo-British Exhibition, London, 1908, Beale Pianos were
awarded Grand Prize and three Gold Medals.)
THE HON. T. WADDELL, ex-State Treasurer, New South Wales: —
‘I heartily wish success to Beale & Co., Ltd., in their great manufacturing
enterprise. They deserve every encouragement that can be given them. It is to
enterprising men such as those connected with this firm that we must look to
find profifable employment for our own people, and to push the country ahead.”
HIS EMINENCE THE LATE CARDINAL MORAN, Archbishop of Sydney:
“I have had great pleasure in visiting Messrs. Beale & Co.’s grand centre of
industry at Annandale, and in congratulating them on the magnificent example
they have set of enlightenment and energy.” Ills Eminence also said : “We must
all, I am sure, rejoice in the wonderful development of industry such as has
been demonstrated by this institution. It has been a revelation to me. I take
this opportunity of testifying my admiration of the work of Messrs. Beale & Co.
I had no idea that in the musical department such perfection had been attained.
I am delighted that such beautiful instruments as those we have seen and heard
are produced in Australia for the cultivation of music, and we must all wish
Messrs. Beale & Co. continued success—a success they undoubtedly deserve.”
IHE HON. SIR ARTHUR RLTLEDGE, K.C.M.G., ex- Attorney-General, Q. :
“I have been much astonished and delighted to witness the operations of an
industry that is rich in promise for the prosperity of New South Wales.” Sir
Arthur also said : “That which interested me most, as I thoroughly understand
the subject, is the apparatus and system for seasoning timber. Not merely is
the timber exposed to the air, under cover, for years, but, above all, the perfect
method of uniform extraction of the sap without injuring the fibres, will enable
the wood to resist all climatic influences. It is the only perfect system I have
met with in Australia, and I was not aware until to-day that it existed amongst
us. Messrs. Beale & Co. are enabled to use in Australia patents for timber
seasoning which are elsewhere exclusive. Hence the complete success.”
COMMANDER WILLIAM J. COLQUHOUN, Commonwealth Naval Forces:—
“The extent and importance of this manufactory has been a revelation to
me, and the proprietors may be justly proud of the result of their energy and
enterprise. From what I have seen of the methods of manufacture, I believe the
Beale Pianos are just the instruments to retain all their fine qualities in all
climates where severe and rapid changes are frequent, and I think they must be
successfully introduced into India, China and Japan.”
THE HON. SIR WILLIAM J. LYNE, K.C.M.G.. ex-Minister for Customs,
Commonwealth of Australia :
"The example Messrs. Beale & Co. have set by employing Australian labor
and skill in turning out the highest grade of artistic work deserves all possible
recognition. Having personally witnessed the manufacture of the parts of their
pianos, I cannot speak too strongly as to their excellent quality.”
THE LATE HON. E. W. O’SULLIVAN, Minister of Public Works, N.S.W.:—
“I consider it the duty of every citizen of the Commonwealth who can afford
it to purchase an Australian-made piano. Messrs. Beale & Co.’s pianos being
of the very best description, and, for our climate, superior to any imported, all
who intend purchasing a piano should show their patriotism by giving preference
to the Australian-made article.”
By our method of selling direct from factory to user we save you all the usual agents and middlemen’s profits.
We have always on hand a number of good second-hand pianos, taken in part payment of Beale Pianos.

Many men use an old-fashioned razor because
the blade can be kept in such perfect condition
by stropping. Not everyone knows that the
Auto Strop Safety Razor gives just this kind
of edge combined with all the advantages of a
safety razor. It “strops itself ”in 12 seconds
without removing the blade, and makes seif-
shaving not only possible but most desirable.
STROPS ITSELF AND SAVES
CONSTANT EXPENSE FOR BLADES.
Obtainable of all high class dealers throughout Australasia.

The Only
Razor that Strops Itself^
BLADE - STROPPING IS EASIER THAN BLADE-
CHANGING AND CHEAPER THAN BLADE-BUYING
i est it against any non-stropping razor and you will realise
not only the enormous saving in blade expense, but the
clean, cool, close shave that only a stropped blade can give.

now the accepted instrument for the artist, and it is the style that is
used by such famous players as Frosini and Guido Deiro. The arrange-
ment of the keys, with their handsome pearl tips only slightly raised
above the keyboard, makes quick execution easy and the extra basses allow
of a variation in the accompaniment that greatly enriches the music.

22 Automatic Rifle
The novelty of its operation is one of
the fascinating features of the Win-
chester .22 Automatic Rifle. Instead of
the downward and upward motion of a
finger lever, or the backward and for-
ward thrust of a slide handle, the pull
on the trigger is the only effort required
to shoot the rifle ten times in success-
ion. The only limit to speed in firing
is the rapidity with which the trigger
can be pulled before each shot. With
this speed is coupled fine accuracy,
light weight, simple and strong con-
struction, and ease and quickness of
handling. Note the beautiful appear-
ance of the rifle. It makes an ideal
rifle for holidays, and is suitable either
FOR TARGET SHOOTING OR GAME

RYERSEN HIGH-SPEED
FRICTION
SAW.
(Patented.)
Cutting steel shapes by
high-speed friction discs
is the most rapid and
efficient method known.

mills, structural, and car
shops where a large ton-
nage of steel is turned
out.
THE RYERSON HIGH-SPEED FRICTION SAW has a capacity to cut
continuously. 18-inch 100-pound beams without turning the 'beam. A 10-inch beam
can be cut in from 28 to 38 SECONDS, and smaller sections in proportionate time.
The Saw Discs are made from ordinary flanged steel, and two are furnished
with each machine. The only sharpening necessary is to occasionally renick the
blades on the edge, which operation can be done in about fifteen minutes with a
special chisel Vhich is furnished with the machine. NO GRINDING OR
GULLETING NECESSARY. Beams or other shapes may be cut on a 'bevel or mitre
at any desired ft'trgle. r

Use Big Ben all day long
Big Ben not only gets you up on
time every morning, but he serves
the whole family all day long as a
reliable clock to tell the right time by.
He’s really two good clocks in one
—an excellent time-keeper and a
splendid alarm.
He can ring you up in the morning
just when you want, and either way
you want —five straight minutes or
every other half minute for all of
ten minutes.
If you’re a light sleeper, turn on
the half-minute taps before you go
to bed. If yon sleep heavily set the
five-minute call and you can slumber
then without the get-up worry on
your mind.
Then when you’re up and doing,
carry Big Ben into the living room
so that the whole family can use him
to tell the right time by. He stands
seven inches tall, and his great big
open face can be seen distinctly across
the largest room.
Big Ben is triple nickel-plated and
wears an inner vest of steel that
insures him for life. His big, bold
figures and hands are easy to read
in the dim morning light. His large,
comfortable keys almost wind them-
selves. He rings five minutes steadily
or ten intermittently. If he is oiled
every other year, there is no telling
how long he will last.
Big Ben is made in La Salle,
Illinois, U.S.A., by Westclox. His
price is 12/6, postage 1/- extra. If
you cannot find him in your town,
send a money order to the makers’
Australian office, Westclox, 63 Pitt
Street, Sydney. They will have
one mailed to you by the nearest
jeweller.

The Inky Way.
Died recently at Sydney, within a fortnight of his
91St birthday, William Bramwell Withers, old
S’African and Victorian journalist. After being by
turns farmer and pressman in Natal, and digger,
wharf clerk and reporter in Victoria, he settled down
to half a century of newspaper work in Ballarat,
chiefly as a member of the Star staff. At one period
he was part-proprietor of that journal with H. R.
Nicholls, the late octogenarian editor of Hobart
Mercury. His “History of Ballarat,” a record of
the once-Golden City’s early childhood, now serves as
a fruitful hunting-ground for Eureka Stockaders and
other story-tellers.

“J. 0.8.”: J. G. O’Connor—“the Old White Hat”
—has passed away at Newcastle (N.S.W.). He took
early to the Inky Way, but the amoupt of bad lan-
guage he had to set up drove him to the pen, and
founding new papers and magazines became a chronic
malady. He was never quite sure what would take
best —the political, the social, the denominational,
or the convivial. When at a dead-end he favored
the convivial. He was roused to such white heat
over O’Farrell’s attempt to shoot Edinburgh at Clon-
tarf that McLerie, then Inspector-General of
Police, had to take a hand—a distinction which
“J.G.” thoroughly enjoyed. In Parliament for a
while he was a merry sprite, but did little good.
When clouds darkened, his friends got into power,
and the influence of his brother-in-law (“Tom” was
“doing splendid” just then) .shunted him on to a
Government job with a decent salary. His only
deflection from decorum was an occasional “hurroo”
on Patrick’s Day.

“Vagabond” (from London): The Daily Herald
(Labor) dies hard On the petition of the printing
co. which was the principal creditor an order was
made for compulsory winding-up; but the editor-
manager announces that a new syndicate is being
formed, and that the paper will struggle on under
the old name. If the new people could not have
bought the title, they meant, to run it as The Limit
a term which Llovd George applied as an insulting
epithet, but which the Herald seized and trans-
mogrified into a proud boast. The paper has con-
tinued to toil at the multitude of its job for some
weeks as a cheaply-printed four-page affair with
caricaturist Dyson filling a quarter of the sadly
reduced space, and the suffragettes clinging tight to
most of the balance.

“The Grizzly Bear”: Had Superintendent Roche,
instead of caving in, stood to his ukase and smashed
the camaraderie between his detectives and some
newspaper reporters, he would have relieved the Syd-
ney public of at least one newspaper nuisance—the
“smart capture,” in big letters. A housebreaker,
who had incautiously imbibed, lately, mistook a
detective’s boot for the kerbstone, and sat down on
it for a rest? The d. pulled him up and recognised
a man he had been looking for for a month. <( Next

THE NEW GODIVA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I saw Godiva through the city streets
upon her fav’rite courser shyly ride
But yesterday in fancy.
ha if- 7a golden stream—fell down her back
And veiled the snow-white wonders of her side ;
And, as she rode (the time was torrid noon),
There fell a quaint amaze
Upon the decent few—for down the street
A line of kodaks stood—and snapshot men,
t/ong-nosed and eager-eyed,
Prepared to pick her off the moment that
she paced the cameras by.
With notebooks armed the canny journalists
Surveyed the novel scene,
And muttered: “By Gemini— what a tale
lo teH our readers in the Morning News—
Mho, sick of wars, and blood and foolish crimes,
And stupid strings of matrimonial woes,
Pine all for Something New.”
At tattling telephone and telegraph
The spry attendants stood
And flashed abroad to North, South, East and West
the tidings: “She has just commenced her ride,
And starts this moment from the castle yard,
Where all her maidens stand a-weeping sore.
In very sooth, she’s passing through the town
Garbed simply, solely, in her glorious hair.
half-past twelve,” again the wires would tattle,
She passed just where the enterprising Times
Had picketed its dozen, smartest men
To note her progress through old Coventry,
Down to minutest details.
Five minutes later did she face the kodaks,
And brave the spying eyes of all the imps ’
Who, in the name of journalistic zeal,
And high devotion to the name of duty,
Tread decent modesty and shy reserve
Down in the very dust.
Old Coventry, that one time would have hid
Its shamfid head behind a thousand walls,
Is now a garrison of Peeping Toms ;
And every Evening Star and Morning Journal
Will lend ten thousand eyes to all the luckless
Who could not gaze their greedy fill and glut them
What time Godiva rode.”
There was, that day, within that gaping city
One Wight, who did not gaze,
Who sought no window, bought no pictured papers,
And who—when Gossip gabbled of the passing,
And wondered, how the Countess could endure it—
Would halt amazed and stop his modest ears
And bid the babblers cease.
But him his fellow-cits der : ded hugely
As filled with foolish shyness and unfitted
To battle in these grand and stirring days
When he who’d press within the foremost phalanx
Of men o’ the world and pushing sons of Business,
Must hear all, know all, grasp all,
And, from the first, must see all.
And so old Coventry* its new Godiva
Back to her brutish Lord and his high hall
With gibing drove. Ahd now (they say) that noble
Will not remit the tax, be had promised,
Because (he ’plains) : “She hath not kept her pact
In that through ev’ry city in the kingdom,
And not through ancient Coventry alone,
By virtue of the Press’s million eyes,

How that may be, I know not. But Godiva
Doth now immure herself within her castle
And comes forth never more.
Perchance she feels all sacrifice is useless ;
Perchance she feels the Age is vile and worthless,
Perchance, again, the thought may grieve and vex
her
That Modesty, her first and dearest jewel,
Was but an idle off’ring on the altar,
Of Caliban, the Mob, whose Heav’n is Lewdnese,
Whose priestess is the Press!

IN BANANA LAND
“Chop-Chop”: A gang of eight men, at
Hambledon, near Cairns, cut and loaded 50
tons of sugar-cane from Hives’s farm in one
recent day, and hauled the same over one
and a half miles of portable tramline (very
portable in places) to the siding. This, which
just about constitutes a record, is regarded
up here as a rather decent performance for
mere whites to put up in the tired, torrid
North, where, as Bruce Smith knows, whites
cannot worK and thrive, but shrivel up and
die young. This 6j tons per man also com-
pares favorably with the two tons per man
which, cut and loaded, was considered a
creditable day’s work in the days of our
dusky kanaka friends. Yet there are alleged
whites who still compare black with white
for this work —or any work, for the matter
of that.
The Butterman Ministry proposes to
restore the postal vote in the blessed hope
that that do<jg6 may make the Government’s
position more secure than the Federal elec-
tions in Queensland foreshadowed. Some
of the Ministerials bleat; about giving sick
women facilities to vote; they conveniently
forget {he cases that came' to light before
an Elections Tribunal, where it was shown
that, when the system was practised before,
some of the free and independent males who
were not sick were sent out on polling day
to estates near Warwick to cut burr at
4s. 6d. per hour, while agents handed in
their postal votes. Toryism is far too
squeamish ; what it should do is to restore
the plural vote. In 1893 the late B. D.
Morehead had 19 votes. He used 11, and
no doubt would have us*d the other eR-t
if there had been any real necessity.
“Rufus”: The myth that a place must
necessarily be hot because it is in North
Queensland is responsible for a lot of fool-
ish practices. Take the case of Herberton.
for instance. Here, for the past four
months, the weather has caused cold shivers
to crinkle the spine of the most hardened
southerner. Day after day and week after
week, the wind howls like seven devils, with
an accompaniment of sleety rain. Inhab-
itants flop through the streets muffled in
great-coats, heads drawn low between
shoulders, . and the bark of the influenza
fiend is heard in the land. If a
fine day happens, a frost invariably
freezes the whiskers of the night. And we
come home to houses built on the same plan
as those in the stewpan of Cairns! On
high piles, in exposed positions (as I write
the wind has caught my papers, and I shiv-
eringl.v chase them), and, worst of all, no
firedaces! Probably not half a dozen
houses in the town can boast of these latter
comforts. And all this because Herberton
is in North Queensland, and because, being
in North Queensland, a stuoid tradition
says we should be eternally grilling.
Noon.
[FOR TH BULLETIN.]
The sun is drawing vapor from the sea.
And curling it about the distant hills.
A greedy lover is the brazen sun,
He scorches to despair the stirless leaves,
Shrivels the .lichen’s loving on the rocks
And bares their nakedness before his kiss ;
He slays the shell-starred weeds upon the
beach
The Sea, his rival, cast there at the Flow.
A dawn gift for the decking of the world.
He sucks the scented resin of the pines.
He presses wide the drowsy eyes of flowers,
He fills with lust for him the modest buds
And makes their petals flame in wanton red.
The very edges of the waves are warm,
Inconstant things, that treacherously flee
The mournful pleading of pellucid depths
And the still coolness of the ocean’s heart.
And now across the brown of fallen cones,
The blood-warmth of the narrow trail of
sand
Between the shiny bracken's folded cowls.
There is the shimmer of an ivory flank ;
A satin skin the bold sun dare not smite
And the rose-arch of wilful, tripping feet—
With the black hair that hides the bosom’s
tips
Falling like some swart cloak from her small
head
To let the swelling snow break now and
then
Through the close, spicy clinging of a tress,
And the faint reek of some wild creature’s
hide
As, sleek and subtle in his yellow stripes.
Pale green-eyed glimmer, and fierce dripping
jaw,
Rubbing and purring, with his great claws
, sheathed.
Come the witch woman and her beast, to
bathe.
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 2. 1913.
My Dear Thargominpau,—
George V.’s substitute in Bananaland, the
ehiel Maegregor, has been attending to his
diplomatic duties with care and punctuality
since I forwarded my last oiiicial despatch.
During the week he supolied lustre to the
annual meeting of the Children's Hospital
and assisted to open a wood-pulp business
at lanaman. Alter that he escorted his
family to the home of Mrs. McConnel, at
Cressbrook, for a restful week-end. The
Vision put in a morning at the Prevention
of Cruelty and Crfeche and Kindergarten
ball meeting, and also blew in to the theatre
one night with Mrs. A. J. Cotton and her
daughter.
Private Secretary Byth left on Friday to
join the Suevic at Melbourne, and every-
body (you know the kind of everybody I
mean), is wondering who will be invited to
take his place. The Maegregor started a
new and very sensible idea when he selected
Australians for A.D.C. and private secre-
tary, and no other vice-regal team here-
abouts ever ran with so few hitches. It is
expected that the Chiel will express his
satisfaction by appointing another Brisbane
boy. The Byth young man, who has won a
scholarship at Oxford, intends to remain in
that classical spot for two years. After
that he hopes to return to his native sun-
shine and bore into journalism or some such
highly remunerative toil.
THE SUPPLIANT.
INQUISITIVE FARE (who has parted the barely legal fare): “ Er — cabman, what's the
matter with your horse's front tegs?”
CARRY (hoarsely): “Not a word , sir, not a word! He's goin ’ down on his knees ter
arsk yer fer a tip."
The Brisbane Cricket Ground was well
strewn with pleasure pilgrims to-day when
the Carnival of Nations took place. Premier
Denham and his wife, the Arthur Morgans,
the Clara Butt lady and her husband, and
several other more-or-less notable birds
occupied front perches. Over 1000
kiddies took part in the show, and
though some of the nations represented
were grossly maligned in their “national
costumes”’ at least the small Aus-
tralians had a real day out. The Norman
Park section of the Bth Battalion Senior
Cadets (the champion team of Australia)
gave a display of physical exercises, and
the rest of the programme was filled up
with goat races and other mild excitements.
Financially the carnival was a great suc-
cess, and the Residential College for Women
and the National Council of Women should
feel a distinct swelling of the bank account.
There were only two dark spots on the
management’s record. The first was the
absence of ushers, whereby those of the pub-
lic who had paid for reserved seats were in
many cases unable to occupy them —-a dis-
tinct advantage to those who had not re-
served seats. : The other had to do with tea.
Tickets for the refreshment were on sale at
the gate, and dozens of patrons bought them
there. In most cases that closed the trans-
action. Anyhow, at i to 5 p.m. the cup that
cheers wasn’t doing it, unless by stealth.
The Arts and Crafts Society burst into
public notice on Friday, when it held its
first annual exhibition. The sister society
of Sydnev had lent a supply of china-paint-
ing, metal-work. etc., and a Melbourne girl
had forwarded -a consignment of leather
things. Amongst several beautiful old art
relics which had been loaned were a pair
of 18th-century candlesticks and a Nnrem-
burg bread box, belonging to Mrs. Robin
Dods; a beaten copper begging-bowl from
India, owned by Miss Townley; and some-
body else’s Florentine cloth. The society
has only 27 members so far, yet the general
display was a credit. Miss Kate Armstrong
sent some stencilling, Isabel Townley and
Gwen Stanley china painting, Mrs. Bob
Philp. leather work, little Agatha Fitzgerald
(vvFo has only just put up her hair) exqui-
site book-illustrations. Mrs. Priestley, Mrs.
Tivey and Mrs. Scott Fletcher kept up the
University’s reputation with samples of
their skill, and envious eyes rested on
the brass work hammered by Mrs. Moran
and designed by Miss Lahev. The artistic
side of the Australian is not the void some
inartistic people suggest.
Mrs. Dudley White, who used to be Miss
Yaldwyn, has been staying with relatives in
Toowoomba, and is now in Brisbane.
Colonel Dudley White belongs to a very
well-known Queensland family, and both
husband and wife were received with a per-
fect deluge of tea and smiles. Mrs. Fred
Taylor, of England, is here. too. On Thurs-
day morning Mrs. MacNish nourished some
dozens of local inhabitants at the Cafe
Eschenhagen in honor of both ladies. In
the afternoon Mrs. Cecil Palmer repeated
the operation at Hamilton.
On Wednesday afternoon Minna
McGrath’s teapot was upturned for Evelyn
Kibble, who is to be married to Dr. Walker
early this month. Mrs. McGrath is an ex-
cellent hostess, and daughter Minna assisted
to keep the pot boiling and the sandwich
circulating.
Mollie Ferrier gave a dance on Thursday
night in honor of the two White girls, from
Pikedale Station. It was a glorious night,
the floor was all that could be desired, and
the supper called for the manufacture of
some new adjectives; but many - of the
guests were suffering where the doctors
scored, and the dancing lymped.
Three pretty girls are to be married this
month. One is Ililma Ohman, and the
others are two cousins. Gladys and Eileen
Markwell. Gladys is to marry a disgust-
ingly-rich American named Drake, and
Eileen, who has the bluest of eyes and the
curliest of dark hair, is to marry Norman
Heaslop, who is a very respectable, nice
boy despite the fact that he is a footballer
by inclination.
The Liedertafel 'concerted on Tuesday
night. Miss Emily Holberger was the solJ.
and sue soloed to satistaction. Leonard
Francis has done much for the choir, but
the orchestra still requires somg blue re-
marks for errors.
The Australian Composers’ concert on
Thursday night would have been much bet-
ter for some of the composers if some of
the performers had stayed at home. The
virtues of the compositions were hidden
beneath the sins of the singers, especially
in, some of the quartettes and part songs.
Several items had to be cut out, in conse-
quence of a strong desire on the part of the
audience to get home before the milkman:
and even then the programme was far too
long.
The bunny-huggings, of the week were
under the sanction of the Orchid Assembly,
the Caledonian Society, the Younger Set!
and the Brisbane Ladies’ Rowing Club.
Show- Week is full of hops, in more senses
than one.
Clara Butt and her husband are filling
the Exhibition Hall with song to-night and
“The Count of Luxembourg” is busy at His
Majesty’s.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Died, at Mount Morgan, D. D. O’Connell,
sport, philanthropist and good Liberal, lie
was a kinsman of the great Daniel, but most
of D. D.’s oratory was poured out, not from
the platform, but across his drapery counter.
Adamson’s motion the other day in favor
of the partition of Queensland reminded
Townsville of the days when it saw 'separa-
tion so surely coming that it had a land
sale near the site of the residence it had
chosen for the new Governor of the North.
As much as £4O was paid per acre. Any-
body who offers £4 now can have it—and
the seller will shout.
At last the Government is making some
little reparation for the atrocities committed
on the best timbers in the world. The For-
estry Department has lately cleared away
the bush round some thousands of young
cedars in the Atherton Scrub, so perhaps
young Australians of a hundred years hepce
may still be able to see the sort of stuff that
pigsties used to be made of.
Frivate, Enterprise is about to make an
onslaught on what should be the municipal
services of Townsville. Having acquired a
25 years’ option over the streets, P.E. is
floating a co. to instal cars, driven by storage
batteries, the first to be used in Bananaland.
Like the patriot that he is, Private Enter-
prise intends to import his wares from the
U.S.A.. and will probablv bring also a few
managers and the materials for a handful of
strikes and other scoui'ges.
From Rockhampton :
Magnus, manager of Mount Morgan, has set a
good example to all big wage-paying companies. He
has met his employees and a minimum wage has
been arranged, to the satisfaction of the men, and
without the consumption of money and time of
formal arbitration proceedings. The minimum for
ordinary labor has been raised to 9s. a day, while
machine men, handle men, timber men and truckers
all go up an extra shilling. Holidays, overtime and
contract ’work have also been provided for. All em-
ployees will participate in the increase, except en-
gine-drivers, electricians and others who had; re-
cently been dealt with ; and the men at Marmor and
Many Peaks, as well as those at Mount Morgan, come
under the new arrangement. The scale has to go
to the. directors for their approval, after which it
will be brought before Judge Macnaughton to be
registered as an award, j
The Farmers’ Union, * which
started out with' a fine blare of trumpets,
has been brought to heel. It is now “the
Liberal Country Party,” prepared to
do battle for the middlemen who boss
Queensland. The bogey of the Rural
Workers’ Union has worked the change. Six
months ago the Farmers were crowing
loudly about the candidates they were
going to send to Parliament; now the mem-
bers go down on their crops to the Govern-
ment wirepullers with H whining “Will I
suit, please V”

The Best Saddle in Australia
for the Stockman
-£6llOl-
is
I
We have been making saddles for close on half a century—and
all we know about the game has gone into the making of this
famous Stock Saddle of ours. It is hand-made throughout—no
cheap and nasty machine work anywhere. It is built on the
staunchest tree of specially tempered steel, fitted with an
unbreakable gulletplate, to which are riveted (not screwed, mind
you) solid steel hind crupper plates. This makes the tree
absolutely unbreakable, yet gives just the elasticity and “give”
needed. The seat is made of specially tanned bag leather, with
very long, thick harness leather flaps, that do away with the
need of wearing leggings. There are leather points to the panel, that will
not wear out for the whole life of the saddle. The knee pads are 54 inches
high, and made of solid leather, double sewn inside so that thev won’t sag
or give over. The thigh pads are made in the same wav and 1J inches
high. We have the seats with as high a dish as 6 inches, but any lower
r^ 011 want we can kive you.'i The mountings are brass I 'and nickel, and
the Dees are fastened so securely that no tug will strain them. The panel
is serge lined, and with extended facings so as not to fray or wear out by
the rubbing of the swag or tucker gear. The saddle is sold fitted with
fold or split leather girths, 4 bar irons, stirrup leathers, ring or ordinary
crupper and surcingle.
OUR GUARANTEE.—Any number of these saddles of ours 'sold ten years
ago are in use to-day and practically as good as new. No stauncher saddle
could be made. The one you buy from us we will guarantee fob two years.
If within that time the saddle proves faulty in material or workmanship, if
you return it to us, we will give you a new saddle in place of it free of
pharge. If a saddle lasts two years it will last as long as it is cared for
—though of course no saddle will stand being rolled on or being bumped
against a tree.

quickly and surely with
WILKINSON’S
ECLECTRIC OINTMENT.
Price 116, posted 119. J. WILKINSON, Chemist,
1] Wlokham Street, Valley, Brisbane.


ARE YOU
deaf?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier ’to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by talcing the strain off them—the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum ha 3 been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
horn deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured and you can be cured, too. You mav wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take thorn out
whenever you wish Children can wear them (w
have special sizes for children from six to twelve)

For RIFLEMEN
To be won in the Commonwealth
during the next three months.
Are you properly equipped for winning your
share of this ? In other words, is your rifle fitted
with the B.S.A. No. 9 Aperture Sight
or the B.S.A. Special Match Barrel?
There is no Rifle Sight in the world to com-
pare with the' famous
BaS-An
no. 9 APERTURE SIGHT
for RIGIDITY, ABSOLUTE
ACCURACY and EASE OF
• ADJUSTMENT.
The B.S.A. Sight has been used by the winner
of every King’s Prize at Bisley since the
introduction of Aperture Sights.
The B.S.A. Sight was used by over 95 per cent.
of riflemen at the 1912 Bisley Meeting.
The B.S.A. Sight is used by over 10,000 riflemen
in Australia alone.
The B.S.A. Sight has won more King’s Prizes
and cash in Australia than all other
aperture sights put together.
The B.S.A. Sight is the only Perfect Possible
Producer. Men who know will use the
B.S.A. Sight in spite of the fact that they
cost a few shillings more than the locally
made imitations, but they also know that
the B.S.A. Sight will probably win them
as many pounds in their first match.
Do not hesitate, insist upon the tried and
proven B.S.A. Sight and the B.S.A.Match
Barrel, and go down to the butts perfectly
equipped.

booklet on Rifle Sights. Post free to all riflemen

Scalp Dry. Hair Fell Out in Large
Quantities. Used Cuticura Soap
and Ointment few Days. Itching
Stopped. In About Three Months
Had Full Growth of Hair.
Orchard St., Armadale, Vic. —“About
two years ago I was employed as a boundary
rider in the north of Queensland. My head
and scalp became quite dry
and my hair began to fall
out in large quantities. For
a time 1 paid no attention
to it, I did not think it was
serious, and my head be-
came bald in patches.
“I was almost giving up
in despair when I noticed
‘an advertisement of the
Cuticura Remedies and made up my mind
to give Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Oint-
ment a trial. I used the Cuticura Ointment
and washed my head with Cuticura Soap
night and morning. After I had continued
this for a few days, the itching seemed to
stop, and after about three months I had
my full growth of hair again.” (Signed)
John Williams, July 19, 1911.
For pimples and blackheads the following
is a most effective and economical treatment:
Gently smear the affected parts with Cuticura
Ointment, on the end of the finger, but do not
rub. Wash off the Cuticura Ointment in five
minutes with Cuticura Soap and hot water
and continue bathing for some minutes. This
treatment is best on rising and retiring. At
other times use Cuticura Soap freely for the
toilet and bath, toassistin preventing inflam-
mation, irritation and clogging of the pores.
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment are
sold throughout the world. Liberal sample
of each mailed free, with 32-p. Skin Book.

H. D. Morton, vHio succeeds the prickly
Willis in the chair of the N.S.W. Assembly,
is compounded of bank clerk, squatter, agri-
cultural-showman, coursing, racing and
jumping enthusiast (he owned the crack
“leppers” Desmond and Lady Morton) and
football referee. He will probably find the
last ingredient the most useful in his new
job.
“Dollar” : Bulletin remarks about cram-
ming houses into small spaces in Sydney
remind me that at Kalgoorlie and Boulder
jerry-built dwellings are crowded up as if
land was scarce at £lOOO a foot, while ven-
tilation and natural lighting are entirely
neglected. Backyards are almost non-exist-
ent, and the garbage heap is usually within
a few feet of the dining-room window. Ocu-
lists thrive, because houses are so dark that
most of the population has to wear specs.,
while still 30 years young. Though millions
of acres lie vacant all around, it is not
uncommon to see linen hanging to dry on a
balcony or a house-top. At times there is
talk of enforcing the Building Act, but as
action must be taken by local bumbles, and
as local bumbles are mostly landlords, the
bad state of affairs is likely to continue.
“The Longshoreman”: If Bishop Crossley,
late of Auckland, isn’t superstitious about
the loss of his cross while boarding a
steamer, as related by “Nuki” (B. 24/7/T3),
he ought to be, for he hasn’t had much luck
since. First came his total breakdown and
consequent resignation of a fairly good and
thoroughly congenial billet. And last month,
while preparing to embark at Brisbane for
Manila —accidents while about to embark
appear to be his strong suit —he blew the
dame of a methylated spirit lamp into his
face, injuring both eyes. Some sermons
which lie preached in Auckland last year on
“Prayers for the Dead” got him into much
hot water with the furiously Protestant
members of his flock —the same lot who
worried his predecessor, Neligan, into resign-
ing—so it would seem that for the future
he had better keep off spirits, both methy-
lated and disembodied.
Lindsay Russell, the unusual Victorian
girl who wrote “Smouldering Fires,” and
lias got a similar sectarian novel going in
England, seems to be an intersting medical
subject, apart from her literary pretensions.
Awhile ago, when she was in London, the
physicians at the Brompton Hospital diag-
nosed her tubercular trouble to be due to
pressure of bone against the wall of one
lung. The bone, they said, had practically
killed the lung, and the dead tissue bleeds
away, hence her coughing of blood. The
doctors reckoned that if they had her under
their care for six months, to be duly fed up
and rested before and after the operation,
they could remove the dead tissue. A man
who had this operation performed when he
was 30 is said to be going strong at the age
of 72. After hearing nil this, Lindsay Rus-
sell returned to Melbourne and went on
catching cold as before. Apparently she is
full of undisciplined talent and eccentric
energy. The titles of her books—“Smould-
ering Fires,” “Souls in Pawn,” etc., are com-
mercial inspirations.
Melbourne Brick Commission is learning
more of the ways of the blessed Combine.
The contractor for the Queensland Insurance
Building, in Collins-sfreet, wanted “facing”
bricks for the ferroconcrete building. The
Combine, either because it didn’t approve of
concrete, or because it didn’t like the builder,
declined to supply them, and gave no reason.
The contractor was therefore driven to Syd-
ney, but the Combine had a “horrible under-
standing” with the Harbor City, apparently,
for, after he had got a few loads, the Sydney
cos. unaccountably refused him any more,
and he had to obtain what he wanted
through a suburban builder, and ship them
over as “terra-cotta.” At another Mel-
bourne job a carter, on a Saturday after-
noon, unloaded some fancy bricks over a
locked gate. Many were broken and use-
less, and the contractor put in a claim. The
only reply he got was by telephone: “Unless
your account is settled in 24 hours we refuse
supplies.”
“The Old Soldier” on cheap war:—
Why are the ‘‘Great Powers of Europe” so miser-
ably helpless against the small Powers as they have
proved to be during this wretched Balkan racket?
To the Government of a great and highly-civilised
nation —Britain, France or Germany—war, even on
a comparatively small scale, is not an adventure to
be lightly entered on. It is not only necessary to
see that the fighting men are there with their arms,
horses and weapons, but to provide for their con-
veyance to the theatre of war, which is sure to be
100 miles or more away, to feed them when they
get there, and to see that medical and surgical help
is available when they get sick or are hurt. If any
of the three Governments named failed to provide
food or medical care for its soldiers in the field, the
consequences would be serious. During the Crimean
War, the failure of the British commissariat and
medical departments wrecked the Aberdeen Govern-
ment, and in the war with Austria in 1866 an out-
break of cholera in the Prussian army compelled an
early conclusion of peace. Such considerations have
had no influence with the Balkan States. They went
to war with an enemy living just across the road,
or at most only a block away. Their fighting forces
were well armed and equipped, but there was nothing
behind them. The supply, ambulance and medical
services simply did not exist. Food and ammuni-
tion were sent forward to the army in bullock-carts
requisitioned from the peasants and driven by any
old men and boys who were available. For back-
loading there were the wounded, roughly dressed on
the field of battle by the utterly inadequate medical
staff, and laid in the bullock carts for transport to
the base at Sofia over a road already cut up by the
passage of the army with all its artillery and train.
No one will wonder that the slow-moving strings
of bullock-carts took a week, or a fortnight to
traverse 50 or 60 miles, and the wounded they
carried often died on the way, whilst the wounds of
those who lived to get to the base became poisoned.
That is one of the ways of making war cheaply. The
Turks at the beginning forgot to provide for feeding
their men, beside neglecting the hospital service.
If such things had been done anvwhere but in east-
ern Europe, or in Asia, they would be called incredi-
ble, but hardly anything is incredible when the
Asiatic, or the eastern European, who is at best
only a half-civilised Asiatic, is concerned. In any
case, making war on the cheap usually proves an
expensive game in the end. The Bulgars have found
it so, for they began by expending men instead of
monev. The two regiments raised in Sofia contained
all the literates in the place—the lawyers, scientific
men and a good many schoolmasters. The archi-
tect who planned and constructed the new public
buildings that had made the place one of the finest
in Europe shouldered a rifle in the ranks. In the
first encounters with the Turks these two regiments
were nearly wiped out. Then the ranks were filled
up from the reserve, and they were sent into action
again, and again they were nearly wiped
out. Men are, no doubt, cheap in the
Balkan Peninsula, but if the supply is limited,
it is much cheaper to expend time and money and
save the men. Bulgaria seems to have pretty nearly
run out of its supply of fighting humans.

portability, freedom from smoke, dust, asheis, odor, etc.
We can furnish luminous radiators from t*9/- up, and the
designs are artistic and pleasing. The one illustrated iq

Raspberry jam of carrot and tomato,
Or pepper thinned by turmeric and flour,
Or “coffee” strongly touched with powdered

From no seraglio, but pressed in casks
By feet of superstitious Grecian serfs

And straight was carried to a dungeon cell
And made to pay a sovereign for the crime.
The mayor had acted very like a cow !
How silly ’tis to try to clean a town
When all the councillors cry out for lysol
Or other disinfectant help for Tammany?

It was a nine days’ wonder,
And then forgot! And I was unsuspect!

The Psychologist.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
aEORGE RONALD BURTON (I
believe he had a never-exercised
right to string half the alphabet
after his name) was a tall, blonde, rather
cadaverous individual, with no pronounced
feature save his close-set, curiously brilliant
eyes—violet, l think they were. At the
tir “ e I write he was between 45
and 50, a bachelor of independent means,
pursuing in almost solitary absorption the
scientific researches to which he was de-
voted.
A chemist of unusual attainments and
a master of anatomy, psychology had be-
come the chief hobby of his later years.
Having exhaustively studied and analysed
the composition and attributes of the body,
he ardently sought knowledge of the immor-
tal, immaterial Something by which all
ages have believed the body to be animated.
Burton rented apartments a few doors
from my office. He had occupied them
for over a decade, during which time I had
known him at first slightly, and for the last
two or three years more intimately, though
our intercourse had never gone beyond those
scientific interests from which it had sprung.
It was as a scholar, a mentality, rather
than as a human being, that Burton im-
pressed me. His lore was so much in ad-
vance of the times, so out-of-the-way, that
I regarded him as 1 might a wonderful
volume embodying the psychic wisdom of
centuries hence.
Physically he was the reverse of prepos-
sessing. Morally he seemed perfectly nor-
mal; and, though I knew nothing of his
earlier life, I should say that on the whole
he was rather better than most men. He
lived a quite orderly life with his books
and apparatus, mixing seldom with his
kind, but, whenever sqlicited, freely, if ab-
stractedly, contributing to the relief of their
needs and sufferings. In fact, he had but
one apparent vice—-the intense selfishness
of the self-centred recluse.
And yet, in spite of all that, one day his
own soul rose up and slew him!
It was a steaming hot afternoon of
midsummer when Burton walked into my
consulting-room, where I lounged behind
drawn blinds. He plumped himself down
before me.
“The human soul,” he said, without even
the preface of a greeting, “weighs one-
quarter of an ounce.”
“Indeed,” I said,' not unfamiliar with his
ways, and too hdat-enervated to evince
much interest on this occasion. “I fancy
I did read something to that effect lately.
They arrived at that conclusion by a pro-
cess of weighing first the dying and then
the dead —did they not?”
“They did; but I long ago deduced that
by just such means.”
“Ah?”
“Yes; I refrained from publishing my
discovery, but that is the case. With
finely balanced scales I experimented with
over a score of subjects, and the results
were practically invariable. Moribund per-
sons were placed on the scales immediately
before death, and the position of the indi-
cating needle carefully noted. In each in-
stance that needle dropped one-quarter
ounce—roughly speaking—at the exact
moment of death.”
“Strange !”
“Thereby proving the existence within
us of some impalpable essence which is at
least the concomitant, if not the actual
source, of human life.”
“What about animals?” I queried lazily.
“ ‘Of human life,’ I said,” he snapped.
“With animals I have also experimented
in the same way; but their weight does
not fluctuate either way.”
“Still?”
“Well, if the —let us say soul; if the
soul, the human soul (there would appear
to be no animal soul) —if the soul, then,
weighs even one-quarter of an ounce, that
soul, be it ever so ethereal, must also pos-
sess substance since it possesses weight.”
I ftsscntcd#
“And,” he continued, “if the soul pos-
sesses substanch, the soul, separated from
the body, must refract light.”
“Then,” I commented, “it would be vis-
ible ! Yet I haven’t” —
“That is to say,” he broke in. “you do
not admit the argument. But, in the first
place, substance is not -necessarily visible,’
he persisted. “The air we breathe is sub-
stance, yet it is invisible to the eye;. but.it
can be photographed when it is set in vio-
lent motion. Second: I have an idea that
the Will —call it what you like —which cer-
tainly dominates all things, animate and in-
animate, hypnotises the death-watchers and
paralyses the more delicate optic senses.
“Now,” he continued, “a highly-sensitized
photo-plate behind a high-power lens is more
susceptible than the healthiest and keenest
eye ever set in a human head —and is not.
I believe, subservient to hypnotism. There-
fore, I am going to photograph a 50u1....
I am come to ask your assistance.”
For a space I stared at him in dumb
astonishment; then I laughed.. “Your the-
v,,ry.” I said at last, “is ingenious and fas-
cinating: but how in the world can I be of
"Assistance to you ? Do you- expect me to
obtain admission for you to the bedside of
the next patient I am unlucky enough to
have dying on my hands? Or am I to pro-
vide a subject and contrive”—
“You jest!” he cut in. “Do not concern
yourself. I propose to provide, my own
subject —in my own person., I simply ask
that you will hypnotise me.”

URIC ACID DANGERS

story."
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
are sold by all chemists and stores
at 2/9 per bottle (6 bottles 15/3),
or post free on receipt of price
from Foster-McClellan Co., 76
Pitt Street, Sydney.
Enough of this Poison gets into the Blood every few hours to cause death. Your kidneys
alone can save you.
When excess uric acid is left in the blood by weak kidneys, it causes more disease than any
other poison
And it is more to be feared, because uric acid poisoning is slow, and hard to detedl —you
may not notice it at first, except for a feeling of heaviness, drowsiness and irritability ; but
before long the trouble becomes more pronounced —the back aches-—the limbs swell - the heart
oecomes affected ; there are rheumatic pains; gravel is seen in the water, and the need to relieve
the bladder is much too frequent, especially at night.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are a special kidney medicine ; they promote a regular action
of the kidneys and bladder, so that the uric acid poison is taken out of the blood and drained
away; this medicine is therefore of the highest value in lumbago, backache, dropsy, inflamma-
tion of the bladder, distress in seeking relief, and any kidney or bladder irregularity.
CURED TO STAY CURED.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
Mr. Alfred Hairsine, Farnley. Cowles Road, Mosman, Sydney, says:—“For many years my wife suffered
with the kidneys and bladder. The symptoms were striking, aching pains in the back, and inability to retain the
secretions. She would have to get up four or five times every night, and this spoilt her rest. Besides this, the
urine contained sediment and was stringy. Ten years ago, when in England, she consulted a doctor in Leeds;
he failed to do her any good, and remarked to her: ‘There is something about your case that I cannot understand.’
I mention this fact because kidney trouble is often misii nderstood. On our return to Sydney she went to one of
the leading doctors; he said she was suffering from catarrh of the bladder (commonly called inflammation of the
bladder). He prescribed for her, but his medicine did her no good. She had several prescriptions made up,
and used various other remedies, but she was getting worse all the time. She was scarcely able to get about,
and would be confined to her bed for days at a time. She commenced taking Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills in January, 1904, and they soon made an improvement in her health by driving out the impurities
through the secretions in a natural manner. Before long she was able to walk about, the backache was cured,
and the secretions were regulated: tin’s she was not disturbed at night. Doap’s Backache Kidney Pills have
done her a wonderful power of good. Seeing how Doan’s Backache, Kidney Pills have benefited mv wife, and not
feeling well myself—l had painful symptoms of urinary troubles, and difficulty in passing the urine—l also
commenced to take them. They proved just as good in my case by regulating the secretions and expelling the
sediment and other impurities. We both feel better than we did , for years, and the thanks are due to Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills.” ,
Eight years later Mr. Hairsine says:-;—“My wife and I have both been free of Kidney Trouble since Doans
Backache Kidney Pills cured us eight years ago.”

“Hypnotise you!”
“Just that. I am convinced that in the
deeper hypnotic trance-state the spirit is
liberated from the flesh as surely—though
only temporarily and without entire sus-
pension of the physical functions —as in
death. I am aware that, in your treatment
of neurotic disorders, you have frequently
had recourse to hypnosis, and that in that
branch of modern therapeutics you have a
considerable reputation. I merely ask vnu
to use your powers upon me; my apparatus
will do the rest.”
Even as he spoke the thought came to me
that, with his high-strung, nervous tempera-
ment, he would probably prove extraordi-
narily sensitive to the force he desired me
to exercise.
“But,” I questioned, “how, if I consent
and plunge you into the deepest hvpnotic
sleep—how will that serve your end?”
“Come with me to my rooms,” he said,
rising.
Arrived there he proceeded, with his
usual directness, to the matter in hand.
“I propose,” he began, 1 “that we should
use this room. There stands a loaded cam-
era which perfectly fulfils the conditions I
mentioned. It is set and focussed to take
the full length of that couch —and no more.
I shall first draw che blinds, rendering the
room comparatively dark ; then stretch my-
self on the couch. After your first few
passes, if you perceive that I am in any way
responsive, you will remove the cap from
the lens and, standing at my head-—-about
a foot away from it will bring you out of
the camera’s range—you will intensify the
trance until it is as absolute as your will
can make it. That done, leave me so for 15
minutes; then arouse me. Simple enough,
you see. Will you do it?”
Simple enough, as he said ; yet my nerves
shrank from the proposition in a manner
for which my brain failed to account. I
recollect that I grew angry with myself,
with my unreasoning, unreasonable repug-
nance, and that I forced out on affirmative
to his eager question.
“Thank yon ! At once then” ; and imme-
diately he stepped to one window after the
other, lowering the heavy, opaque shades.
This done, the room was, to unaccus-
tomed eyes, black as/ the Pit. I heard him
grone. without a word, to the couch, and
cast himself upon it; and I felt my way to
his side.
“Commence,” he commanded softly.
(Why does darkness beget whisners?)
Forthwith I took up ray position at his
head as he had indicated, and proceeded in
my usual manner to hypnotise him.
As I had foreseen, he proved an easy sub-
ject. In less than five minutes he became
somnolent. I carefully moved to the cam-
era, uncovered the lens, and regained my
place. Gradually, stage by stage. I deep-
ened the trance till I was conscious that
my personal efforts could carry it no far-
ther ; and, somewhat exhausted, I found a
chair and sat down to await the expiration
of the prescribed quarter-hour.
I was obliged to guess the time, but I en-
devored to be on the sure side, and it was
doubtless all of 15 minutes before I re-
turned and applied the customary restorative
treatment.
In this instance unconsciousness had
been so profound that the awakening was
a somewhat prolonged process, but it must
have been well within half an hour, reckoned
from my initial passes, that Burton was on
his feet again, in the full, soft glow of the
sunset, and warmly thanking me for my
performance.
“Sit down, doctor, sit down!” he ex-
claimed. “It has been a success, an entire
success—l feel it! Wait but another 10
minutes and you shall look upon that which
no mortal eyes ever before beheld—the neg-
ative of an actual portrait of a soul! He
jerked the plate-holder from his instrument
and rushed into his dark-room, and the door
banged behind him.
I sat there in the mellow evening light—
five minutes —10 minutes? I do not know.
I was dreaming strange dreams. As to the
result of Burton’s experiment I was singu-
larly unconcerned; its success was so un-
thinkable. I suppose, too, my late exertions
had rendered my brain lethargic. So I sat
on.
Then from the dark-room came a thud
and a clatter. What.... I sprang to the
Moor, flung it men, and stiffened as I stood,
with my body bent forward over the thresh-
liold !
Before me was a tiny room. Dim snapes
of many bottles and jars rose upon the
tiered shelves. To the right w T as a long,
narrow bench. On it stood a ruby-lantern
and an over-turned shallow tray. The
blood-red rays from the lantern, dimly light-
ing the interior, streamed close to a huddled
heap on the floor almost under the bench —-
a black blot, over which trickled the spilled
liquid from the upset tray.
Without the least sense of volition, I
stepped forward. The removal of my bulk
from the doorway permitted the entrance of
a stream of twilight from the outer room,
and this tracked across the grey gloom that
underlay the glow of scarlet, and fell re-
vealingly upon the contorted shape of
George Ronald Burton.
Mechanically—at the moment I was con-
scious of neither thought nor feeling—l
turned and straightened the body, and,
kneeling, fumbled for the pulse, while listen-
ing with my ear over the heart; but I
knew he was gone—had known it in the
instant that I heard his fall.
In shifting the dead man a small square
of glass, lying on the floor close beside him.
had been exposed to view. Presently I
noticed it. His negative—ah! With a
faint but moving interest I picked it up,
and. rising slowly to my feet, held it up to
the open doorway.
What I saw in a single glance will haunt
me to the grave : —beyond, it may be.
I cannot describe that which, in black and
white, stood out on that bit of glass between
me and the light. The portrait of a naked
soul! Picture the foulest fiend ; conceive of
a Thing festering with all the sores of all
the diseases man is heir to. with their mul-
tiplied agony and all mortal anguish stamped
upon its distorted features. Imagine. .. .
No—you cannot! George Burton looked
unon the presentment of bis own soul —and
died. I looked, and, looking, swooned and
lay among the splintered fragments of that
awful plate.
And now I know there is a Hell.
COSMOS.
The Lady of the Mist.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
THE all-night boat has simple ways,
It bears a simple crew.
And he who has a sixpence pays
And joins the festive few —
The beer-belated waifs and strays
Whose homing hour is tw T o.
Alas ! My pockets hung forlorn.
Limp, vain as some cool dream
Dreamt by young wethers lately shorn
Beside a withered stream,
Or like the cow tli&t in the morn
Is emptied of her cream.
I had no coin wherewith to woo
The kindness of that ark
Which o’er the sleeping harbor drew
Her bulk out of the dark.
I lingered in the solemn dew,
And made a stern remark.
I said a thing profane and loud,
And with an angry eye
I scanned the void and saw a. cloud
Slow drifting down the sky—
A misty thing serene and proud,
That looked x-emote and dry.
Like some god’s whiskers it was curled,
And when it heard me speak
It whisked its bulk across the world
And made a shining streak,
As though by some large person hurled
To smite me on the cheek.
It fell about me as a fog
Where yet in wrath I stood,
With all the bitterness of Gog
And Magog in mv mood.
It fawned upon me like a dog
Whose hairy tail is crude.
I stroked it with a kindly hand.
My anger passed away
To see so large a creature stand
Between me and the bay,
And making all the sea and land
One blotch of formless grey.
But as it laid a hairy paw
Upon the sleeping hill,
A vision of delight I saw
That made my heart stand still.
(Remember I had drunk beer raw.
Then blame me if you will.)
Her hair was black as thrice-combed ink.
Her bosom paper white.
Her soft eyes looked like things to drink
In unrestrained delight.
And standing there I could not think
What kept her up all night.
I said: “Bright vision of the dark.
Come watch with me a while.
The happy fog-dog has no bark.
The night is free from guile.
And there is no one to remark
If you and I should smile.”
Then was I glad in all my soul
I could not pay the boat,
For as ray arm around her stole
Joy caught me by the throat —
I was as playful as a foal
Or youngling of the goat.
Fog-wrapped amid a sleeping world
She drew me to her breast,
And at her touch all cares were whirled
Far to the east and west,
I did not care save for those curled
Rod lips so hotly pressed.
When I had kissed her eighteen times
I paused to dr*"*- a breath.
(This is an awkward word for rhymes
Except in odes to death
Or writing of far distant climes
Where dwelt the sons of Heth.)
When eighteen kisses I had pressed -
Upon her lovely lip
I paused to take a little rest,
As bees that honey sip
Their summer banquet must digest,
Poised on a blossom’s tip.
And as I paused a person strode
Between me and the maid;
The hint of wallop that he showed
All passion far outweighed;
His fist was like a camel’s load,
And made my soul afraid.
I trembled like a cabbage leaf
When shaken by the breeze.
I wilted like a round of beef;
My sick heart felt like cheese;
Whiie hands of rage and fear and grief
Seemed plucking at my knees.
His was a dreadful eye to watch,
It seemed so fierce and dark.
No living wight could beauty snatch
From such a fearful nark
“Can you oblige me with a match?”
Was his insane remark.
I breathed again. He said “Good night!”
And vanished in the mist;
Rut nowhere within sound or sight
That loveliness I wist.
Nowhere were lips of red delight
That waited to be kist.
And all the hours of dark I spent.
My hot heart fierce and blind.
Till morning that grey fog-veil rent
And made the oink east kind ;
Rut she who came and kist and went
I simplv could not find.
Bv day I dream, by night I seek
That phantom lady fair.
Whose dark hair falling on ray cheek
Made gladness and despair.
As well might I pursue last week
Or chase a tuft of air.
Yet some time, on the all-night boat,
Or on the black shore near.
Out of a fog her eyes shall float
To fill my soul with cheer.
Till then I sit in pubs remote,
Sustaining dreams on beer.
