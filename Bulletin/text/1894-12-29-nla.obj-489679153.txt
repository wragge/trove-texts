CLEVELAND STREET SYDNEY
Queen Victoria does not take B’s in gloves
(as alleged by an ill-informed newspaper), but
“large sixes.” The Duke of Buccleuch possesses
a silver, model of the Queen’s hand—lucky duke !
“■which will refute the libel in ages to come.
An eminently respectable Melb. publica
tion is set on Sundays by Seventh Day Adventist
compositors. Yet if Jos. Symes wanted to set
his Liberator on the Sabbath by atheist labor,
the whole right-thinking community would be up
in arms, and Jos. would be languishing in a
dungeon within 24 hours.
Apropos of the Wairarapa enquiry, a story
is told of a witness at a similar court of investiga-
tion. The Bench took a week to decide what
ought to have been done at this wreck. The
captain said, when he heard the finding : “Quito
right, gentlemen, only you have taken six days to
think it over. I had less than six minutes.”
There is a good deal of logic in this view of the
case. The average Marine Board would be con
siderably brightened up if it was taken out and
wrecked occasionally, so that it could also try its
hand at deciding in six minutes on the right course
to pursue.
FIFTY YEARS A FAVORITE.
Th» multiplication of cures for all sorts and con-
ditions of complaints during the last decade has
become so bewildering that many people have
sworn off what are called patent medicines alto-
gether. And we can scarcely wonder at it, for
there is a very large proportion of so-called medi-
cines which scarcely possess any known value in
the struggle against pain and disease. The
attention of. the public is therefore specially
directed to Pond’s Extract, as advertised elsewhere
in this journal. It is not a new remedy, for it
has been a popular favorite in the United States
of America for the last half-century—indeed, as a
positive specific for the worst cases of piles,
hemorrhages, and inflammations of every de-
scription, both internal and external, this famous
medicine, which is an extract of the well-known
Witch Hazel, has become a watchword to sufferers.
Pond’s Extract is being vigorously pushed in
Australia, and no doubt success will attend the
efforts of Messrs. M. Moss and do., the whole-
sale agents. for Australasia, of this renowned
medicine.

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing Humors
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity. [No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin without blemish and a body nour-
ished with pure blood.

St. Patrick’s Cathedral Fair, Melbourne,
has realised a profit of <£10,000, but this is £10,000
short of the sum required by the trustees to make
matters easy. With two contracts on hand repre-
senting £40,000, it will require some extra
clever engineering and several more fairs to pull
the big building out of its financial mud. Those
people who, in boom times, promised to pay £20

this is the kernel of the trouble.
Chairman of Committees Mason (Y.) con-
siders it smart to “ sit on” the veteran Longmore,
whenever thatdecent old man is more than ordinar-

that M‘Intyre, in the old days, was “ nothing but
a Freetrade barracker,” Mason, with some
acerbity, called him to order, and remarked that
“ the House was not used to that sort of language
now.” Truly the House that endured Bent and
which endures Patterson is growing particular in
its old age.

Dear Bulletin,— Re V. J. Daley’s note
upon the pronunciation of “Jaques” (the
“ melancholy ”), the orthoepy which rhymes the
word with “rakes” is the received stage-usage—
aa is also the English sound given to the “ch” in
“ Petruchio,” instead of the “ k”-sound proper to
it as an Italian word. Partially-informed persons
are fond of insisting upon the original pronuncia-
tion of those foreign proper names which have
acquired, by established English usage, an English
sound. The affected ass who inserts the French
“Pa-r-ree” into an English context is only a
shade more ridiculous than the cheap pedant who
carefully aspirates the first letter of “Juan,” or
calls the Knight of La Mancha “Don Keeghottay,”
and who —to be consistently Spanish—would have
to call the squire not “ Ganko Panza,” but
“Ganoho Pantha.” —A.M.

Dear Bulletin, —A larrikin told this story
in my hearing. He was drunk at the time. I
suppose the story was a lie, and I don’t even know
if it was an original lie, but I give it for what it
is worth. “You know Bill,” he said to another
larrikin, and the other one acquiesced. “You
know Bill? Well, Jim had the nark with him
over Liz. So we went w’ere Bill lives ’way up
Collin’wood. You know wot a fool Bill is—he
lives top of a pxace three storeys high. Boards.
Well, we sings out—‘Bill! Bill!’ And Bill, ’e
comes to the winder. ‘Bill,’ we sez, ‘Bill, the place
is afire!’ You know wot a fool Bill is. Bill sez
‘I’ll come down the stairs.’ ‘No,’ we sez, ‘they’re
all afire, too, you’ll have to jump—we’ve got a
blanket.’ You know wot a fool Bill is—well, ’e
jumped. Of course we never ’ad no blanket. You
should ‘ave seen Bill.” Then the pair laughed
wildly and departed.—Yours, Fluffy.

Victoria and New South Wales:
A Comparison.
Ever since the long-enduring “fiscal ques-
t on ’ came to the front in New South Wales
it has been the fashion to draw parallels
between that province and Victoria in order
to demonstrate the relative advantages of
Foreign-trade or Protection, as the case may
be. The two states lie side by side ; they
are inhabited by people of the same race ;
they are much alike in climate and
population, and for these and other reasons
they lend themselves conveniently to this
species of argument. And the argument
lends itself so conveniently to all purposes
that each party has proved conclusively, over
Hid over again, by figures which cannot lie,
that its own theory is absolutely right and
the opposing theory wholly wrong. Some-
times the results are arrived at by a compari-
son of two isolated facts ; sometimes by
garbled statistics and the invention of evi-
dence ; generally by the foolish and illo-
gical assumption that all good results,
no matter of what kind or variety, are
attributable to “ our ” fiscal policy,
and all bad ones, from financial dis-
honesty down to the destruction of the
crops by caterpillars, to the other man’s
fiscal policy. This mode of reasoning never
reaches a definite conclusion, and leads
nowhere, and proves nothing ; as a means ,
of upholding any special faith it only serves
the same unscientific purpose as bad language
and road - metal. Nevertheless, there is
much valuable information to be gained by
a comparison of the relative situation ot the
tw» provinces, when it is made on the widest
possible basis, and The Bulletin proposes to
furnish such a comparison, and to make it as
comprehensive as the available figures will
admit. The usual custom is to seize upon
one isolated circumstance and to preach a
journalistic sermon thereon ; The Bulletin
proposes to supply instead all the pertinent
facts to be found in the published works of
Mr. Coghlan, the New South Wales Govern-
ment Statistician, and leave the sermon
mostly to inference. The result will be as
clear an exposition of the relative merits of
Foreign-trade and Protection as the unsatis-
factory science of statistics and the difficulty
of tracing cause and effect can permit.
# # #
The two provinces did not by any means
start abreast in the race—a fact that is
generally overlooked in instituting compari-
sons. New South Wales was in existence
for half-a-century before its rival was first
heard of. It had a considerable population,
a large export trade, and much accumulated
wealth before Victoria even began to come
into existence. It has also nearly four times
the area of its neighbor, a soil at
least equally rich, as evidenced by
its superior yield per acre in many
varieties of crops ; and an abundance
of coal, iron, and various other raw
materials essential to manufacturing in-
dustries, wherein Victoria is almost wholly
deficient. Except in the matter of gold, in
which it has long been pre-eminent, Victoria
comes far behind New South Wales in almost
all natural advantages. The Southern pro-
vince has produced, however, in the aggre-
gate, £232,000,000 worth of the yellow
metal, against barely £40,000,000 extracted
from the mines of New South Wales. How
much solid advantage was gained by this
circumstance no one can profess to know,
for the country was raided in the early
auriferous days by the adventurers of all the
earth, and the gold was dissipated to the
furthest ends of the globe. Victoria
kept the lead as a mineral-producing
province until seven years ago, when
its yield sank into comparative insignificance.
New South Wales now produces minerals
to more than twice the value of those
of Victoria ; consequently the latter
province has lost —and, to all appear-
ance, lost irrecoverably—the only natural
advantage which it ever possessed over
its neighbor. During the last seven
years, therefore, it is reasonable to
assume that New South Wales, with its
enormous area, its mineral production,
its huge wool export, which Victoria—for
want of space—cannot possibly rival, its vast
public lands revenue, which the adjacent
province, through lack of lands to produce
revenue, is utterly unable to approach, and
the alleged blessings of Foreign-trade in
addition, should have left the small, frag-
mentary southern state a very long distance
behind. It should have done that much
even without the advantages of Foreign-
trade, but with them thrown in it should
have done it much more definitely. If it
failed to gain any appreciable advantage,
then the inference is that the great Foreign-
trade policy is rather an incubus than an
aid.
Agriculture is admittedly the most impor-
tant of all industries, and in this branch Vic-
toria is a very long distance ahead. The
total value of all crops in 1893 was £6,665,000
against rather less than £4,000,000 in New
South Wales. In 1861 the two provinces stood
about on an equality, but with the advent of
Protection, Victoria began to move rapidly
ahead until it not only became self-support-
ing in most respects but was one of the great
sources for the supply of New South Wales,
and other provinces. It is now, despite its
small area, the principal exporter of food-
products in Australasia. Its production of
wheat is more than 2| times that of New
South Wales ; and this despite the fact that
it yields per acre only half as much as its
more fertile competitor. It produces nine
times as much oats, eight times as much
barley, nearly three times the quantity of
potatoes, twice as much hay, nearly twice as
much wine, 50 per cent, more fruit, and
nearly seven times as much in the shape of
minor crops. In the matter of tobacco,
maize, and sugar-cane, New South Wales has
a remarkable lead, principally, so far as the
two latter are concerned, because they refuse
to grow in the Victorian climate ; but, on the
whole, the larger and older province is vastly
inferior to its neighbor. And, when allowance
is made for the fact that the average produce
for each acre in New South Wales is valued
at £3 18s. against £2 19s. in Victoria, the
discrepancy is even more marked. The fact
that the Victorian farmer achieves such re-
sults on inferior soil says much in his
favor, or else in fafcdr of the system under
which he works. During the two years of
partial Protection under the Dibbs Adminis-
tration, New South Wales did a good deal
towards closing up the gap, which, in the
days of the old Foreign-trade regime, was
even more conspicuous that it now is.
* * #
In manufactures of all kinds, Victoria finds
employment for 167,000 people, and produ jes
£22,000,000 worth of manufactured goods
per annum ; New South Wales employs
140,000 persons, and turns out goods to the
annual value of £16,000,000. In this
respect the Southern province is grievously
handicapped by the fact that almost all the
coal employed in its industries has hitherto
been imported from New South Wales, and
the very small amount locally produced was
of inferior quality and extracted at heavy cost.
Victoria, unlike New South Wales, has also
no local supply of kerosene shale, and no known
iron deposits of any extent, and under
all these disadvantageous conditions its great
supremacy in manufactures is little short of
marvellous. Of the populations of the two
provinces, New South Wales has a larger
proportion of lawyers, civil servants, military
men, parsons, doctors, paupers, domestics,
habitual criminals, and various other varie-
ties of non-producers, but in the matter of
actual producers, despite her larger popula-
tion, she is considerably behind. And in
many other and diverse ways the progress
of Victoria is very marked. A much smaller
proportion of the population lives in one and
two-roomed shanties ; there are only 24,000
of these unwholesome habitations in the
province against 40,000 in New South Wales.
Victoria has by far the more extensive rail-
way system. Its illiterate population is very
much smaller than that of N.S. Wales. It has
60 per cent, less criminal convictions, and —
for the one tiling is to some extent connected
with the other—it has more than twice as
many free libraries ; also, it has 30 per cent,
fewer paupers. There are 28,300 small land-
holders—this term being used to cover
owners of holdings of not over 100 acres —in
Victoria, against 25,800 in New South Wales.
Also, Victoria has 21,000 holders of between
100 and 500 acres apiece, against only 17,000
in New South Wales. In the matter of
large estates, however, the latter has a bad
pre-eminence. Victoria is, to a great extent,
a province of small, independent cultivators;
New South Wales one of big landed mono-
polists. Victoria has more savings-bank
deposits and nearly twice as many depositors,
and it has more deposits in ordinary banks
and building societies. At the same time,
New South Wales has the questionable honor
of being considerably ahead in the matter of
loans on mortgages, and the Cornstalk
farmer, so far as the available figures show,
is much more heavily involved than the agri-
culturist across the Murray.
# # *
On the other side of the case, New South
Wales is generally estimated to possess much
the larger aggregation of private wealth.
Its surplus, however, consists wholly of land
values. Owing to its superior area it has in
private hands nearly twice the acreage of the
adjacent province, and this natural advantage
more than accounts for the difference.
Again, New South Wales is the largest ex-
porting province in Australasia, being
£7,000,000 annually ahead of Victoria, but
this surplus consists almost wholly of wool
and cattle, and its supremacy is again
entirely owing to its vast extent. By com-
parison with agriculture, wool-growing is a
pursuit which requires little labor, and here
the natural advantages of the older province
have compensated for the evils of its fiscal
policy and the unprogressive character of its
inhabitants. Also, its stupendous area has
blessed its Government with a revenue from
public lands which even now amounts
to £2,200,000 per annum. Against this
Victoria, by reason of its narrow
dimensions, can only show a total of
£500,000, and the difference of £1,700,000
yearly has enabled the Government at
Sydney to keep its finances moderately
straight, and to ascribe its partial solvency
to the blessings and advantages of Foreign-
trade. If it were possible, however, which,
at present, it is not, to put the two provinces
on a similar footing in this respect, the New
South Wales Treasury would be, so far as all
evidence goes, the more insolvent of the
two.
• • •
How much of the aggregate discrepancy
between the two provinces is to be ascribed
to fiscal systems, and how much to other
causes, no person can pretend to accurately
estimate. The raw process of logic which
ascribes all the difference to tariff policies is
obviously an absurdity ; it is too wide, and
covers too many varied circumstances to be
wholly owing to any one cause or set of
causes. But the figures supplied by the
highest statistical authority in New South
Wales, at all events utterly demolish the
favorite assumption that Freetrade neces-
sarily spells prosperity, and that Protection
is synonymous with ruin. They show con-
clusively that the Protectionist province,
with a vastly inferior area, a less fertile soil,
a smaller population, and a grievous lack of
almost all the mineral resources which are
essential to manufacturing pursuits, and
with a history shorter by half a century, has
somehow overtaken her Freetrade rival in
manufactures, agriculture, and, to put it
shortly, in everything except those few
pursuits which her climate and her want of
space make almost impossible. And if these
results are, as the Foreign - trade party
alleges, in no degree whatever owing to her
fiscal policy, then it rests with that party to
explain what they are owing to.
Some Australian Characteristics.
The ingenuous Annie Besant, before leaving
Australia, confided to an interviewer her
general sense of disappointment with the Aus-
tralian character. The Australians, it seems,
came to see Annie as they would have come to
see a fat woman, or a sea-serpent, or a two-
headed calf; and when their curiosity was
satisfied they simply went away again. They
did not stay to be converted to theosophy ; in
fact, they did not seem to care anything at all
about theosophy ; they paid their cash to hear a
clever woman speaking, a woman whose name
and reputation were familiar to them, and they
paid rather more readily when she did not
speak about theosophy, because they found
other subjects more interesting than that vague
and mystic muddle. When Annie waxed elo-
quent about the threefold plane and the seven-
fold path and the fifteenfold fiddlesticks, they
only smiled pleasantly and said “ Next!” From
which the lady argues that Australians are not
mentally alert. Only dull people, apparently,
do not swallow the awful crammers of theo-
sophy. It doesn’t seem to have occurred to
Annie that the fault might lie with theosophy.
# * #
In any case, as The Bulletin recently pointed
out, Sydney and Melbourne audiences are not
Australia. Intellectual life is, of course,
keenest in the cities; but its intensity there
lacks something of the breadth and strength
occasionally found in the isolation of the bush.
The divergence of type which Clarke antici-
pated between residents in the temperate zone
and residents in the tropics, is really growing,
as Adams noticed, between dwellers in the in-
terior and dwellers on the littoral. The dif-
ference in temperature between North and
South Australia is not sufficiently marked to
establish any vivid contrast of character. The
difference between the conditions''of bush and
city life is already showing itself in the mind
and physique of the people. The advantage
is with the bush. Stand in a Sydney or
Melbourne street on Saturday night and
note how large is the proportion of weedy,
stunted forms, and callous, degraded faces
in the passing crowd. The bush, giving
health and strength not to be found in
alleys and factories, dowers manhood and
womanhood with dignity. Bush monotony, it
is true, narrows all but strong and original
minds. The flatness of existence, the raiity
of elevating intercourse and rational recreation,
too often deaden bright spirits into soulless
apathy. The cities are precocious and vicious.
The bush is sometimes dull and apathetic. The
character of its denizens is colored by their
sombre environment. Theirs is a stoic philo-
sophy ; that of the coast is gay and epicurean.
Annie Besant’s city audiences laughed at, her
dogmas without taking the trouble to seriously
understand them. In the bush, people would
have wrestled with and overthrown them.
There is a note of feminine frivolity about
Australian cities; a tinge of masculine harsh-
ness about the Australian bush. The cities
judge intuitively; the bush reasons logically.
But conclusions respecting’theosophy would be
identical all over Australia.
« * «
And, despite Annie Besant, our careless and
slightly contemptuous attitude to wards her latest
foible shows the presence of “mental alertness”
rather than its absence. Theosophy, as a creed,
does not demand the intelligence which com-
prehends : it only asks the faith which
for granted. Had she come among us as a cfitic
instead of as an advocate, Annie Besant would
probably have found, as all other critics have
found, that intellectual brightness and agility is a
prominent Australian characteristic. Australian
smartness seems indeed united with shallowness.
This conclusion, reached by local observation, is
made reasonable by foreign experience, and sup-
ported, among other things, by the noticeable
merit of Australian journalism and light Austra-
lian literature, and the noticeable lack of literary
works involving severe study and long-con-
tinued effort. But there is no doubt about the
smartness. Schoolmasters know that Aus-
tralian children apprehend much more readily
than English children of the same age and class.
Climate —involving, as it does, speedier develop-
ment ; habitual association with elders; and
greater social comfort, are chiefly responsible
for the quickened wit.
* « «
It would be a good thing for Australians if
the average temperature of their continent
could be reduced 10 degrees all round. The
quick change from childhood to adult age
tends to weaken the national physique ; and
in the coastal districts, especially North of
Capricorn, the intense heat enervates. In the
interior, as Miss Shaw has noticed, the warm,
dry air has tonic properties not found else-
where. But Australian growth, generally
speaking, is too rapid to secure the finest type
of physique. We gain in height by losing
breadth of shoulder and valuable chest-space ;
and many parts of Australia lack the lime
wanted to make good bone. Yet the race now
being evolved will be fitter for its environment
than any which could be imported. The writer
has seen sun-dried Queenslanders and ruddy
Maorilanders trudging 200 miles to a Northern
rush. They started all together, side by side,
but on the third day many of the Maorilanders
—big, beefy, stalwart men—were being carried
by the tough, lathy Queenslanders. In feats
of strength the Australian bushman may easily
be beaten ; but for feats of endurance who can
surpass him ?
• # *
The rock of Australian irreverence, on which
Annie Besant split, is well-known to every
pastor and spiritual master who attempts to
sail over life’s solemn southern main. Among
Australians born there is no religion worth the
name. They are frank pagans, intent on
getting as much joy as possible in this world,
and altogether careless of the next. It is in-
teresting to watch the facile descent to Austra-
lian heathenism. Nearly all immigrants who
reach our shores make a point of going to
church twice every Sunday. Their children go
once—until they are married. Their grand-
children do not go at all. The parsonical occu-
pation is already falling into disrepute, and the
parsons are turning to trade, or education, or
politics, to make a living. It is quite con-
ceivable that the sixth generation of native
Australians will pay their threepences to see
“ That great curiosity—the Parson ” exhibited
as the tenth wonder of the world in a circus
menagerie. And this want of respect for
traditional fetishes is another proof that Aus-
tralians possess the “mental alertness” which
Annie Besant denies them. For only stupid
ignorance worships without knowing why.
“The intellect has no knees.” Australians
yield ready homage to pluck, to knowledge, to
genius. But they have a keen eye for counter-
feits, and every claimant for veneration has to
show a satisfactory title. The respectable Mr.
Kidd, in his recent book on “Social Evolu-
tion,” extols reverence as if it were a valuable
quality no matter what .its object. It is a
horrible thought to respectable people that the
world is beginning to enquire into the validity
of its ancient shibboleths. The Bulletin
glories in the indisputable fact that young
Australia doesn’t care a goburra for shibboleths ;
and that its attitude to the universe is not that


of a crouching suppliant, but of a man—“ erect
upon two legs ” after the fashion of the
“ being” who deceived Mrs. Bard ell.
• • •
That Australia’s insouciant reception of theo-
sophy has also met many things of much
more importance native observers are painfully
aware. Our half-gods have gone, and our gods
have not arrived. The national character
wants deepening and strengthening in the stress
of national need. Compare the interest in
Federation with the interest in an international
cricket-match. Nobody but a rare thinker, an
infrequent editor, or an occasional politician
goes out of his way to do a hand’s turn for
Federation. The people are vaguely acquies-
cent ; they believe that Australian union is
necessary and desirable; but they are not
enthusiastic about it. They do not sit up
nights brooding over the subject; and meet-
ings to discuss it can only get a quorum
in the cities. But the man in the street
crowds all day to gaze at the scores
of the cricket-match ; and thousands of young
Australians, well-born, well-fed, well-clad, with
exactly the same kind of countenance covered
by exactly the same kind of straw-hat, pay
eagerly to witness the play; while the news-
papers are forced to give cricket as much pro-
minence as they give Parliament. There is no
objection; cricket is a good thing; yet one
would like to see equal anxiety shown for better
things—things not of passing local interest, but
of permanent national importance. There seems
ground for the fear that the making of the Aus-
tralian race is proceeding under too favourable
conditions. It may be that in order to realise
all the hopes which our poets have uttered for
us, we shall yet need to pass through the fur-
nace of suffering, and serve our apprenticeship
to sorrow.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Imported Militaire.
There was no mistaking the temper in which
New South Wales Assembly attacked the mili-
tary estimates. By 58 votes to 18, £7OOO was
knocked off the total, with the understanding
that it was to come from the “allowances ” for
mythical houses or fabulous horses or fairy-tale
forage by which many officers substantially
increase their pay at the expense of the peren-
nially-bleeding country. By 50 votes to 31 the
item of £26,000 for a holiday encampment was
struck out altogether. The Bulletin cordially
approves. The province is well able to save
£33,000, and to spare its value in imported
militarism. This paper has no ambition to see
established here the army of idlers which every
European nation scarves and sweats to maintain
—a military caste contemptuous of the toilers
who are taxed to feed it, and at all times ready
to aid in extinguishing popular liberties. The
New South Wales commandant naturally
magnifies his own calling, and there is plenty
of floating sentiment to agree with him. The
red-coated popinjay who forms the average
woman’s type of valour is admired also by
effeminate men, fascinated by fife and drum,
glow and glitter. But no sensible man, no
really courageous man, ever thinks of the
soldier at his best as other than a necessary
evil. In Australia he is unnecessary. If there
is one thing above all others which the demo-
cracy of this Commonwealth should sedulously
combat, it is the establishment of a standing
army on the lines advocated by Major-General
Hutton— to tax the earnings of industry, to
clog the feet of progress, and to set the
organised drones of clique and privilege above
the honest manhood of independent labor. The
chief present risk of Australia lies in her con-
nection with Great Britain, which at any time
may expose her to attack by Great Britain’s
European enemies. That connection once
severed,, there is little to fear; since we have
room and welcome for men of every nationality
whom we can meet upon an equal plane of
civilisation. If there be risk, it is chiefly a sea
risk, which can best be met by the establishment
of an Australian navy, manned by Australian
seamen, in place of the half-dozen leaky-boilered
vessels armed by Britain, manned by Britain,
officered by Britain, and commanded by a
British admiral over whom we have no control
whatever. If there be need of land defence, the
whole male population should be drilled and
trained to the use of arms ; but the function of
the professional soldier must be confined to
advice and direction. The present system is
an expensive play, of which the encampment is
an extra - expensive appurtenance. Did an
enemy once land in force Major-General Hut-
ton’s half-trained levies would meet the familiar
fate of raw recruits opposed to veterans. Aus-
tralia should be defended at sea rather than on
land. In any case, the creation under the
Southern Cross of a hireling army which places
the citizens who support it under the domina-
tion of an idle military caste, with the object of
perpetuating the nightmare of war which is
rousing tortured European serfs to revolt, is a
thing abominable, intolerable, and monstrous.
♦
Opportune Resentment.
The Victorian Legislative Council, at time of
writing, is getting ready to resent Turner’s
taxation-bill as a gross personal insult. The
Council’s resentment was a foregone conclusion
from the first, so the “ insult ” comes in handy,
as it were. Not that the outrage upon the
Council’s dignity could have been avoided by
any means. Some years ago, when the cloud-
speck of direct taxation was barely visible afar
off, Mr. F. Sargood took precautions to make
this political affront inevitable. He claimed
for the Council a right to amend money-bills
sent along from the Assembly, and James Ser-
vice, with one cold, damp optic gazing steadily
at the distance, winked his other eye at the
new religion, which was well calculated to meet
a crisis like the present. Sargood’s ingeni-
ous claim has no constitutional leg to
stand upon, but an influential section of
the Council decided to nurse it until
such time as it would serve them for a griev-
ance. The hour for brandishing this abortional
“right” came the other day when the taxa
tion bill was submitted to the Council for
acceptance or rejection—but not for amendment.
Just previously, Sargood, together with an
unportfolioed minion named Pratt, had thrown
off his ghost of a disguise and retired from the
Ministry. This was the anxiously-awaited cue
for Council indignation. The “ insult ” was at
hand. The little mob of “ old politicians,”
elected by landowners for landowners, no
longer railed against the principles of the bill.
Some of them even pretended a mild affec-
tion for the article itself. The “arrogant”
manner in which it had been sent up
by the Assembly was the only thing that hurt
their feelings. President Zeal, for instance,
moaned as follows to a newspaper interviewer :
“Such little amendments as we might have
made would not have affected the purpose of
the Bill, and now I do not see how the Council
can avoid taking action to resent the course the
Government has adopted. They must resent
it.” The President of the Victorian Legislative
Council appears to gauge popular intelligence
by the puerile pomposity of his political class.
The Turner Government adopted the same
course with the taxation Bill that has ever been
followed in cases where money is concerned.
The “ insult ” which the Council couldn’t avoid
resenting is merely an impudent fiction, con-
ceived by a swaggering Tory. Victoria at
large is the affronted party, and the country
should at once consider the possibility of in-
dicting Sargood, Service on a charge
of criminal “ cheek.”
A Roaring Farce.
Another humorous feature crept into the
Federal Bank case, last week. From time to
time since the breakdown of that shocking
institution, there have been disturbances among
the ruins, and on each of these occasions
“something” was vaguely supposed to be on
the point of going to be done in the matter.
Long years ago, stormy meetings of share-
holders and depositors were held, whereat the
voice of Fatman, crying “Shame!” upon the
victims, was powerless to suppress the utter-
ance of many unkind remarks. Subsequently
the story of the Munro clan enjoyed a large
circulation. The fact that the Federal Bank
had been more or less devoured by a group of
unfortunate speculators became unofficially
known to everybody. After another long
pause the question of ousting ex-manager
Priestly from his position as liquidator was
submitted to a Victorian J udge, and then, for
the first time, the eccentricities of the Munro
clan were officially observed and commented
upon. The Judge talked freely of what
might happen if certain people’s conduct
were under consideration in another place, but
other judges had said much about the same
thing concerning other unfortunate speculators
who never reached the place where they might
have been, and once more the matter seemed to
drop with a dull thud. This application to
remove the old clanny liquidator certainly did
yield a practical result, for Priestly lost his
desire to guard the assets, and quietly de-
parted for England. Considering, however,
that Priestly had already rubbed a lot of the
clan’s liability off the slate, and could make
very little difference to the bank’s welfare two
and a half years after the failure, it was
hard to see a reason for his removal, unless it
was to clear the way for doing the something that
never comes off. The application re Priestly
was spread over many months, and an enormous
amount of costs came out of the bankrupt
estate in consequence. A few more months
rolled on. The Federal Bank case got into the
newspapers again, and the lawyers were found
to be extracting a living wage from an examina-
tion of William M‘Lean, an ex-director. Here
was a chance to bring more facts to light at the
poor bank’s expense. An application was made
to a Judge, who ordered that William
M'Lean should give evidence before the
Insolvency Court. The Federal Bank has
not filed a schedule; seemingly, therefore, a
special license for M‘ Lean’s examination was
necessary. After the witness had proceeded a
little way with his amusing disclosures, and
bursts of forgetfulness, he was pressed to un-
ravel the mystery of a certain £25,000 cheque
paid to him on account of the Vic. Baptists’
Fund. On this point William M'Lean de-
clined to be questioned, protesting that Baptist
Funders are “bound to secrecy.” Half-a-dozen
excited reporters hereupon inked their pens
anew in anticipation of “spicy” copy. Then
Mr. M‘Lean’s legal protector came to the
rescue with a really brilliant objection. It had
just struck him that the Insolvency Judge was
not entitled to continue the examination in
public. He argued that his Honor was “ not
sitting in open court,” and a learned discussion
ended in the Judge “ treating the court as his
chambers,” and ordering press and public to get
out. The latest phase of the Federal Bank case
remains shrouded in gloom. The public will
hear no more about the Baptist Fund, or Mr.
M‘Lean’s examination, The Bulletin' sup-
poses. In this instance the groaning creditors
of the Federal must pay another colossal bill of
costs, without getting any fun for their money.

The return laid before N.S.W. Assembly by
Premier Reid as to the Civil Service retrench-
ment of his hated predecessor, has been so
utterly discredited that it has at last been
withdrawn by its authors and suppressed.
According to this publication, Hie Dibbs
Government, during its term of office, “ re-
trenched ” 372 public officers and appointed
1582, the assumption being that, while preach-
ing economy, it added no less than 1200
new officials to the national pay-sheet. The
return was got up in curious fashion. On one side
it accounted for the civil servants who were dis-
charged from the service through retrenchment
only, and took no notice of those who died, or
resigned, or were discharged for other reasons
than retrenchment, or of temporary officers—
such as the 300 or so engaged making out
electoral rights and doing other work under the
E ■ Loral Act—who were dispensed with in the
n i ural course of events, when their temporary
duties were finished. On the other side were
included all appointments, temporary and per-
manent, including navvies, telegraph messen-
gers, and everybody else that could possibly be
included. When one clerk left his billet in a
public office, and seven subordinates got each a
step up in consequence, they were returned as
seven new appointments, and when some
petty functionary was shifted from one town to
another he turned up in the document in like
manner as an entirely new functionary. So did
the man who was shifted to replace him, and
the one who was shifted to replace him, and so
on. Premier Reid, in withdrawing his mis-
leading publication, professes to have presented
it to Parliament without examination, and in
blank ignorance of its character. Seeing that
it was Reid himself who originally moved for
the return, and that it was prepared by his own
subordinates for his own benefit and to his own
order, this utter indifference is remarkable.
Dear Bulletin,— i?e“ that registration clause,”
I would remind you that in Texas they have
what they call a homestead law, which appears
to pretty well crystallise your opinions on this
subject. The law, as quoted in Knox and
Sweet’s “ On a Mexican Mustang,” runs as
follows :
Article 2335 of the Revised Statutes of the State of
Texas provides that the following property shall be re-
served to every family exempt from attachment or execu-
tion, and every other species of forced sale for the pay-
ment of debts, except as hereafter provided : —(1) The
homestead of a family. (2) Household and kitchen furni-
ture. (3) Any lot or lots in a cemetery for purpose of
sepulture. (4) All implements of husbandry. (5) All tools,
apparatus, and books belonging to any profession
or trade. (6) The family library, portraits and pictures.
(7) Five milch cows and their calves. (8) Two yoke of work-
oxen, with necessary yokes and chains. (9) Two horses
and one wagon. (10) One carriage or buggy. (11) One
gun. (12) Twenty hogs. (13) Twenty head of sheep. (14)
All saddles, bridles and harness necessary for use of family.
(15) All provisions and forage on hand for home consump-
tion ; and (16) All current wages for personal service.
Article 2336 interprets “ Homestead” of a family not in
town or city to consist of 200 acres, with improvements.
“Homestead” in a town or city means a lot or lots used
as a home, with its improvements to a certain value.
This seems to be direct enough, but there must
be considerable difference of opinion as to the
advantages of such legislation. It appears to
be fatal to the credit system, and a poor man,
it seems to me, would be very likely to remain
poor under its fostering care. Indeed, under
such a law it is difficult to see how selectors in
this province (Victoria) could have got on at all
with the storekeeper and banker turning a deaf
ear to them. I have known selectors without
capital round about this locality—the few good
men with credit from the storekeeper—to come
out eventually in a good position, and the lazy
or incompetent and inexperienced majority in
the same position to go under as soon as their
holdings became alienable. They all had their
chances, good and bad, and the good men sur-
vived. Under a homestead law none of such
men would have had a chance at all. What do
you think? —Yours, S.C. Euroa, Vic.
Judge a’Beckett (Vic.) had a spasm of virtu®
the other day. “The way in which country
administration suits are worked,” he said, “is
enough to make the law stink in the nostrils of
the public—
Litigation frequently arises out of the administra-
tion of comparatively small estates, and, as the country
solicitor employs an agent in town, and this agent in turn
employs counsel to appear in court, the bill of costs swells
rapidly. It is a perfect disgrace to the law to see how
some of these estates are squandered. One is almost
ashamed of the law that such things should be possible.
A hundred pounds is sometimes spent to ascertain a lia-
bility of £5.”
Consider the various aspects of this feeble
whoop. The system is a disgrace to the law,
and makes the law stink in the nostrils of the
public ; but Judge a’Beckett is only “ almost”
—not quite—ashamed of the law in conse-
quence. The law has to stink an awful lot
before a judge gets quite ashamed of it.
Thus the annual report of the “ National
Scripture Education League,” Vic. :
The correspondence between the Rev. S. Savage and
the Government statist had shown that secular education
in Victoria had been followed by a large increase in
criminality, especially amo.ig the native-born population.
The average religious publication is brother to
the weather-report and next-of-kin to the liver-
specific “ad.,” and in this case it lives up to
its usual character. As a matter of fact, the
correspondence of the Rev. Savage— whoever
he may chance to be—can’t show the alleged
increase of criminality, for no such increase
exists. Since secular education began in
Victoria, crime, as shown by the police records,
has diminished in proportion to population, by
about one-fourth. There is certainly more
crime among the native-born population than
there was, but that is solely because the native-
born population has increased ; in proportion
to the number of adult natives criminality has
decreased enormously. During 1881, out of
every 10,000 adult Victorians, 550 were
arrested for various offences ; in 1891, only 396.
It may further interest the Scripture Education
League to know that in Westralia, .the only
province where education is still conducted on
a Scriptural basis, there is three times as much
serious crime, and more than twice as much
crime of all descriptions, as in the “godless”
states of Australasia. The Scripture League is
either shamefully ignorant, or else its disregard
for accuracy is its phenomenal as that of its own
Scriptures.
Sky-pilot after sky-pilot, in and around Syd"
ney, from a Romish Cardinal down to the Shep-
herd of a non-hierarchical conventicle, has
scoffed at Spiritualism, now that its local
phosphorescence has been out-glittered by the
vermilion tlames of a public conjuror. Which
is, to say the least of it, curious and consistent.
Scoffing conies naturally to the rhinoceros-hided
heart of the materialist, in whom want of faith
is logical; but for the religionist to scoff is
most inconsequential. The chief corner-stones
of each religion are—miracles. Spiritualism is
founded on—miracles. Spiritualism is a religion,
too, of a nondescript sort. Therefore, when
the Shepherds of the Unknown scoff at
Spiritualism, it is only one superstition heaving
mud at another. The Spiritualists are a
sorry lot in argument. Their stock defence
seems to be that Spook-manipulator Hosking,
who claims to be merely a wicked conjuror and
hireling magician, is really a “ meejurn,” selling
his Christ for pieces of silver. Were the
writer a spiritualist he would adopt another
tack. Why not bring up the fabulous stories
of Moses, class Hosking as an Egyptian
magician, and prophesy that the genuine
Aaron’s rod, metamorphosed into a serpent,-
will swallow the Egyptian’s counterfeit every
time? Or, refer to Simon Magus, and claim
the orthodox Christians as spiritualistic advo-
cates. Put the Witch of Endor into the
witness-box, and call Cardinal Moran to give
her a bad character. Under the analysis
of bold, bad scepticism, conventional spiritual-
ism and religionism must live or expire
together.
♦
The Bulletin last week advised Premier Reid
to make an end of New South Wales Legisla-
tive Council’s obstruction to progressive legis-
lation, and if necessary to make an end of the
Council as at present constituted. This week
it repeats the advice with all the added
emphasis justified by the Council’s latest freak
—-the mutilation of the Appropriation Bill,
Opinions may easily differ as to the policy of
the Reid Cabinet in replacing upon its esti-
mates the sum of £216,000 which the Dibbs
Cabinet “saved” from roads and bridges
expenditure. But the validity or otherwise of
that policy is not the point at issue. The
question is simply : Are the people of New
South Wales to be governed by their
representatives, fresh from a general election?
or are they to be governed by Messrs. C. G.
Heydon, Watson, Kerr, Pigott, Charles,
John Davies, Hoskins, Hill, R. H. Roberts,
Moses, Dangar, Cox and Dr. Maclaurin?
Such a question answers itself. When The
Bulletin went to press the action to be taken by
Government had not been fully decided. Upon
the heads of the Ministry lies the responsibility
of vindicating the cardinal principles of demo-
cratic Government, at whatever cost to the
Chamber which shelters the unlucky 13
nominees.
The S.A. Adult Suffrage Bill, which allows all
women over 21 years to vote without any pro-
perty-qualifications, passed its third reading by
31 votes to 14, although the second reading was
only carried by one vote. The passage of the
measure is a great victory for the Govt, and the
Labor-party, especially as the omission of the
property-qualification clauses gives the demo-
cratic-party vastly increased power at the«pol-
ling-booths for all the city constituencies. Op-
positionist Downer and his magnificent retinue
of seven vainly stonewalled at all stages, and
were badly beaten on the property-qualification.
The fact of such a measure passing through
the Council simply illustrates the wonder-
ful alteration that has been worked in that
formerly Tory chamber. Three years ago a
Woman’s Suffrage Bill was contemptuously
rejected by the senile councillors even though
there was a £5O property qualification tacked
on to it, but the Chamber has since been in-
vaded by six direct labour members and four
democrats, and the Tory element has actually
less influence there than in the Assembly. The
measure seems fated to pass. The third reading
in the Council, which had to be carried by an
absolute majority, was postponed for weeks
owing to the illness of labor member Guthrie,
and in the Assembly on two occasions the
Ministerialists stonewalled their own measure
te prevent a division in the absence of the
required number of members. However, S.A.
democrats have secured their toy, and it will bo
interesting to see what they will do with it
Gilbert Casey appeals for public subscriptions
to pay the passages to Paraguay of those
starving Rue Australians who have already
paid the Association for their passages, but
who can’t be sent to their ghastly destination
because the Association has muddled away the
money for other purposes, and thus betrayed
the trust which was placed in it. Mr. Casey
speaks as follows
This appeal is issued upon my own responsibility, in
order that I may sm ceed in the task I have undertaken.
To do that I must have the assistance of outsiders just
now ; because our association has been left absolutely
stone-broke; because it has a number of unfortunate
women and children left on its hands, whose husbands
and fathers have been in Paraguay for the past 12 months;
because it is cruelty to let this continue any longer
through the fear of being sneered at by those who mis-
understand or have no sympathy with the movement ;
because many of our members gave up all their
possessions to the association officers, left their
employment as instructed, and have been in desti-
tute circumstances ever since ; because these unfor-
tunates cannot tie expecled to do a great deal towards
assisting others, though they are doing their level best;
because there is no hope of the association getting any-
thing o it of the Tar or other property ; because it is better
to abandon the attempt than fool round with the law ;
because it is right to send these people across; because
£5O w ill send them all to their husnands and fathers ; be-
cause, finally, a small sum from each of our friends will do
what is needed, and my trust in men and women is great
enough to make me feel absolutely certain that this money
will be received b fore the end of the first week in
January.
A strange situation. From Buenos Ayres the
British Consul appeals to the Australian Govern-
ments—so far, The Bulletin regrets to notice,
without effect—for money to bring a lot of
starving “ mates ” back to Australia. In Aus-
tralia, Gilbert Casey appeals for money to
take another lot of starving mates out to the
land of hunger which the first lot is striving to
get away from. One thing is certain : Any
money subset', bed for the poor Rue Australians
should not be handed to’, or in any way be con-
trolled by, the sorry set of messers through
whose instrumentality the catastrophe has been
brought about.
The retirement of Frederick Sargood,
Victorian Minister of Defence, is the luckiest
tliintr wiiioli lias yet happened to the Turner
Government. It was impossible under any cir-
cumstances to take the bellicose draper seriously.
He was eaten up by a perpetual yearning to rush
out of his ribbon department and mobilise some-
body, or declare war, or throw up entrenchments,
or do something equally ridiculous. He was so
full of vast, incomprehensible, military manoeuvres
that he had no time left for ordinary business, and
his craving to form the Cabinet into a hollow
square with artillery at each corner, or to induce
the Education Department to fix bayonets and
charge, made serious deliberation impossible.
Also his maunderings over commissariat and
cannon and such like things were painful to wit-
ness. He parted from his colleagues ostensibly
over some small and hazy matter connected with
the Land-tax, and in the case of any other equally
high-dried Tory the explanation would have been
sufficiently plausible. In Sargood’s case it is
only possible to assume that he was dissatisfied
with the military policy of the Government, and
felt aggrieved because hostilities hadn’t yet broken
out. Therefore he resigned and went home, pre-
sumably to fortify his drapery - emporium and
prepare for the very worst.

846 Maoquaris-street North, Sydney,
December 25, 1894.
My Dear Moorabinda—
“His Excellency ” Vice-Admiral Bowden-Smith
and his genial admiraless are billed to leave Aus-
tralia per the Ormuz on 14th prox., much to the
grief off Sydney society. Admiralty House has been
a perfect little social heaven during the Bowden-
Smith reign—indeed, the naval (and military) hospi-
talities have more than atoned for the somewhat
infrequent festivities at the legitimate social
apex, Guvmentouse. In recognition, then, of the
heroic way the Bowden-Smiths tugged in the
social collar during their term of office, a public
banquet is to be hurled at the Admiral in the
Centennial Hall, on Wednesday, the 9th prox.,
and a reception to the popular Mrs. Bowden-
Smith will take place at the Town Hall the same
evening. All the three-tailad Bashaws of Sydney
society fig ire on the committee-list, and Messrs.
A. W. Gillies and E. K. Cox are the hon. secs.,
either at the Town Hall or 39 Hunter-street.
Rear-Admiral Bridge (his front appellative is
“ Cyprian ” —what a lovely name to murmur in
the moonlight!) is thj next person to pose as our
naval figurehead, and protect Earm Cove at the
peril of his life. As he is billed to arrive some
days before the present people leave, etiquette
will pack him away somewhere on the Orlando,
even if it’s only to bucket about outside the
Heads until the Ormuz comes down stream. It
would never do to have two mackerel—l mean,
admirals—in the bay; nautical etiquette couldn’t
stand the strain. There would be far too much
“ Get up Jack, let John sit down” about the
situation to make it possible even in a nightmare.
The new admiral is alleged to be rather a poky
sort of entity who (having probably heard all
about the big hide-store erected cheek-by-jowl
with his_ official residence at Kirribilli Point—and
no special grant for lavender-water, either)’has
expressed his intention of living on the flag-
ship, so that if society wants to scare him into
giving tea-parties, it will have to climb over guns
to get at him. There is no Admiraless —a state of
affairs that society rejoices at or deplores accord-
ing to whether it has unmarried daughters or not.
The last Admiral who came out unattached mar-
ried a Melbourne girl, you remember.
Admiral Bridge’s suite possesses a somewhat
Australian interest, Mr. B. Hopkins (no relation
to The Bulletin's Hop., mind you), who comes
au the gallant tar’s secretary, is closely con-
nected by marriage with a Melbourne family
known to fame as mine hosts of one of Mel
bourne’s swellest hotels. This same youth, by the
way, took in all his friends this side with a hoax
made familiar in London by the Gaiety Co., but
quite new to Australia. He was the proud father
of a baby girl, and sent out full particulars : “ She
is a very pretty little thing,” he wrote, in a solemn
strain, “ but unfortunately she hasn’t all her
fingers on one hand.” And it was only when
people had got ever their preliminary shudder
of pity for the poor little thing that they saw
through it. Admiral Bridge’s young man is
evidently a jokist of the deepest dye.
Talking about the Queen’s navee, I am quit®
sure that not one person in a hundred who prowls
over a spruce warship and admires the lavish
trimmings the'reof gives credit where credit is due
for all this burnishing of brass and dolling-up.
The Admiralty isn’t responsible for all the gor-
geousness—it only allows for black and white
paint in scanty quantities, and all the valentine
effects come out of the commander’s fob. If Cap-
tain Corcoran wants to run a ship one mass of
gold-leaf over and beyond the reg’lation coatings
he pays for his little vanity just as the humble
land-lubber pays for a fresh coat of pea-green
paint on the yard-pump.
Miss Melbourne Punch Murphy writes cor-
reotingly to the Bulletin in re a recent “Con-
fidence ” to the effect that the patrons d’honneur
(Lord and Lady Hopetoun) figuring in her sub-
scription-list are only a French version of the good
old charity-ball “ patrons ” who put their hands
in everybody’s pocket but their own. As a matter
of fact, Lord Hopetoun has not only lent his
moral support to the forthcoming literary venture,
but has bespoken a number of copies. Nobody
but a person who can’t see a toad without wanting
to advise him to pawn the jewel in his head in
order to subscribe to a South Sea mission would
expect the complaisant Victorian potentate to do
more.
And talking of novels reminds me that one bud-
ding authoress (not to put too fine a point on it)
was advised, on good authority, to get the names
(merely) of all the Australian Governors on her
subscription-list, as the illustrious roll-call would
have a paralysing effect on the grovelling soul of
the British publisher-man, and probably lead to
more gilt on the cover at reduced rates. All their
Antipodean Excellencies (bar one) gamely respon-
ded at the first call, and not only lent their valu-
able signatures, but ordered copies of. the book
into the bargain. Sir Robert Duff alone stood
out. Although he was not petitioned to subscribe,
only to “ lend his signature ” —“ R. Duff, his X
mark,” would have done at a pinch—he declined
to lend his name, and superfluously refused his
subscription, although nobody asked him for it 1
But a Scotchman can’t help being canny all
round.
By the way, it may be a tip to coming literary
genius (“ within the colony ”) to know that His
Ex. does not give his name and subscription to
books “ published outside the colony ” —which
appears to mean that His Excellency blandly
the priceless boon to books published
within it. And (another clever pointer) quite the
latest Guvmentouse epistolatory mannerism is
to call a lady “Sarah Blank” without the prefix
inside. I must say that it looks horribly inelegant,
but I suppose it’s Prince of Wales-y.
Williamson and Musgrove must be warmly
congratulated by all right-thinking people in
having staged the most sartorially prim panto-
mime at Sydney Lyceum that I have ever sat out.
What “ Cinderella ” principally suffers from is a
great rush of clothing to the figure. Imagine a
fairy godmother who sticks to her quilted red
satin petticoat, high grey bodice and long grey
hat all through the piece and never once lets a pale
pinky silk-stockinged leg shoot out through a
crack in her discreet draperies as a guarantee of
good faith ! Miss Ray Jones (the rather attractive
lady looks as if her surname were Cohen in private
life), an ex-amateur from Melbourne, played
Cinderella, who appeared for the first time in
theatrical history as a brunette. Miss Jones was
not unduly prominent in the title-rdle, and I can-
not help thinking that the cropper she came on her
first entrance (making her bow to a Sydney
audience in the first swimming position) may be
regarded allegorically as affecting .her stage-future,
since “the profession” is so incurably super-
stitious.
Miss Jones’ toilets were not of the happiest
description. Cinderella’s butter-color ball-gown
had a distressing reach-merdown air about it, and
her white wig fitted her cranium about as neatly
as a hen covers a china nest-egg—in fact, Miss
Jones, from being a promising amateur, has
become a very unpromising professional, to my
idea. When Miss Courtenay, in her capacity of
fairy queen, remarked that “A booky she will
want,”it really did seem the one thing needful, for
nobody but a seasoned metallician could precisely
tell what were the exact odds on Miss Jones becom-
ing a public favorite. Another disappointing thing,
from the point of view of the front stalls, lay in
the fact that Prince Peerless was a short, aggres-
sive he-importation from ’Ome, supported on a
most commonplace pair of legs, instead of the
orthodox she-prince, in to-be-continued stockings,
who is much more satisfactory at pantomime
time, when good old grandpa makes a solemn
point of taking the children.
I liked' the procession of sports, and it was
interesting to see that the very first pastime
to get a hand was boating. By the way, the
behavior of the “ boys ” and girls taking part
in these pageants threw a strong light on the
sporting female, who evidently isn’t kept
amused by the game alone, for whenever (in the
pantomime) boating men parted from boating
girls or lawn-tennis hes from net and racquet shes
—in fact, in all the sports where women figured,
the lads and lasses never separated without kis-
sing ! But this, I hope, is a stage fiction, for I
am very reluctant to believe that the lawn-tennis
girl or the yachteress would ever countenance
such frivolous goings-on.
It was also profoundly interesting to observe
that the sports which the Lyceum manage-
ment presumed that women weren’t mixed
up in, included billiards (which every second
Melbourne women plays now as well as a
sharper!), horse-racing, football, cricket and
lacrosse, and the only pastime from which the
noble male was excluded was bathing. This un-
pardonable oversight was probably due to innate
modesty on the part of the management, who did
not think the abbreviated trunks in which man
takes to the water quite complete enough for stage
representation in a censorious world. There isn’t
too much striped paint and gold-leaf about
“ Cinder,” and the neck-to-knee way in which the
fairies are dressed looked as if the N.S.W. ex-
Attorney-General had been fixing his baleful eye
on Titania’s dressmakers. One thing is certain :
the Firm didn’t smother ’em all in clothes for fear
of shocking the new Attorney-General, “ Jack ”
Want. But perhaps it was done in deference to
—all hail!—Mr. Justice Simpson. I am sure it
would be easy to shock Mr. Justice Simpson.
I see that “colored teas k I’Americaine ” are to
take the place this summer of the colored lun-
cheons of last years, and of the two I think I
prefer the teas, for men go to the teas, whereas
the lunches were women-only affairs. A Sydney
matron gave a pink tea the other day. Every-
thing was the hue of the parboiled shrimp, and
most of the guests sported pink in great quanti-
ties—save one. He was (I suppose I ought to say
is) a well-known Sydney man, and when he
appeared in the drawing-room in ordinary morn-
ing costume and perceived the glare in the eye of
his hostess he meekly drew the attention of the
company to the fact that he had pink-silk socks
op. I hear that a blue tea is being talked about.
Are the little stories to be en suite?
Colored teas have one great attraction from a
strictly feminine point of view—there is no better
way for a blonde to “ kill ” a brunette rival than
to give a pea-green tea and watch her victim
rivalling the sunshiny hues of a pound of butter.
Then the brunette effusively retaliates with a
scarlet tea, at which the blonde looks like an over-
boiled potato. It’s a merry game, if you enter
into it scientifically.
On dit that a very distinguished lady who was
recently provoked into handing out the prizes at a
Southern sectarian school, did it with such bad
grace that it completely spoilt the philanthropic
effect. Carpet was laid down for her at the rail-
way station under dozens of triumphal arches, but
she refused to walk on it, perambulating gingerly
along one side, although the committee implored
her to walk freely on the pattern. Then, although
hordes of infants had been readied up to sing
melodies elaborately suited to the occasion after
the prizes had been given, the lady simply poked
the literature on to the model scholars and bolted
in hot haste. I believe the committee is still
gaping with astonishment.
Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, December 17.
Yarmouth, the terpsiehorean earl, broods over
the irreverence of the local press, and declares
that, were the Victorians to ask him on their
bended knees, they should never behold him in
skirts. But, perhaps, some of his implacability is
due to the coldness of our sovereign lord and lady.
The Hopetouns, misled by “unsympathetic re-
ports,” are said, so far, to have completely ignored
the poor innocent’s existence.
Probably this isn’t the Governor’s fault, for he
himself slithers on an extra-smooth board and
gambols boyishly even in the State Lancers; but
one can’t answer for her ladyship, who treads a
measure with the demeanor of Marie Antoinette
going to execution, and curtseys to the very
ground a,s if for the express purpose of extorting
apoplectic reprisals from stout, short-necked part-
ners.
“Yarmouth” must by now deeply regret his
historic Hobart leg-show ; anyhow, he fairly
snorts with anger when asked again to frill and
exhibit his noble calves in the sacred cause of
charity. The misguided young blood probably
now discerns his true position in the stage-world,
which closely approximates that occupied in the
realms of sawdust and spangles by the double-
headed calf and the oyclopean goat. There is, I
am told, much doubt in Hobart elderly-spinster
circles whether Heaven will quietly accept the
charity-fund which the Earl raised by showing his
blue-blooded legs, and a meeting will be held to
prayerfully consider the question.
The coldness between Yarmouth and vice-
regality seems confined to our parish, for the
N.S. W. Governor is apparently on excellent terms
with the Earl. As for Gov. Gormanston ; he took
young “Bloaters” to his heart at first sight, and
the Earl’s Hobart skirt-dancing was patronised on
both nights by the Tasmanian vice-regal party.
Lord Gormanston is an indulgent patriarch with
an amiable weakness for private theatricals.
I bear that the Tasmanian belle, who acted with
the English peer in “ A Pair of Lunatics,” is, as
a rule, handicapped by Pa’s rooted objection to
the stage, but when it comes to obliging Her
Majesty’s representative, a loyal subject will
sacrifice even his beauteous chee-ild upon the altar
of Duty. ~
The sudden stoppage of the Yarmouth revels
has extinguished some bright hopes, which already
began to irradiate the gloom left hanging over
society by a recent fashionable alliance. Feminine
mourners fall back once more on their old sources
of consolation, viz., the bridegroom’s comparative
impecuniosity and the color of his hair.
Some people say Lord Yarmouth isn’t half so
offended by those newspaper remarks as he pro-
fesses to be. Like all the rest of the notabilities
he abuses the press in public and pastes all the
cuttings about himself in his album in private.
“I was standing beside him at a Melb. exhibi-
tion of dancing,” writes a friend, “and over-
heard him relate with great gusto and laughter
some of the paragraphs and verse he stigmatised
as ‘ disgusting.’ His Nibs, who doesn’t look more
than 18 at most, doesn’t seem half a bad sort of
fellow, and appears to have a far greater allowance
of brains fhan the average alleged aristocrat.”
The Austral Salon lately had the honor of
entertaining the seraphic Percy Granger, a boy
of undoubted'musical genius, whom they should
have “ discovered ” a few months ago. This little
lad, with his wistful blue eyes, waving golden
hair, refined features, and delicate complexion, is
a bright exception to the rule that talent and
ugliness go together, the one unpoetic feature
about Percy being his low - comedy walk.
He rolls from the hips like a ship at sea.
It was in connection with the financial side of a
contemplated European training that Percy’s
visit to the Salon had been arranged. The pros,
and cons, of the undertaking were explained at
length to a sympathetic audience by quaint old
Baron Von Mueller, whose full dress for once
lacked the time-honored woollen comforter in
which it is the owner’s custom to beg the pleasure
of a dance.
A well-known professional lady has lately an-
nounced her engagement to a middle-aged
widower, blessed with ample means and pretty
daughters, who are themselves shortly to be
married. “ Taking on ”in the usual style of step-
children elect, they decline to hallow the union by
a filial blessing.
A wedding, celebrated about the time of the
Wairarapa disaster, seemed livelier than the
majority of such affairs, owing perhaps to the facts
that the bride carried money in her train, and the
mother, a rich widow, had already named the
day for a second trip to the altar. All went
merrily until the happy pair had left for their
honeymoon and the guests were gone. Then, to
the surprise of her remaining offspring, the new-
made mother-in-law gave way to tears and

hysterics and requested them to take the wedding-
cake out of her sight, going on to say, what she
had known all day, viz., that their “new Papa’’
had sailed by the Wairarapa, and goodness only
knew whether he was alive or dead. The morrow
brought the widow news of her fiance’s safety,
and when last interviewed, the whole family
appeared as happy as could be expected.
One fair Tasmanienne was surprised at seeing
her name among the superscriptions of a Melb.
journal’s Oup illustrations. Innocent even of a
dream of the races, Imr inclusion in the group
aroused in her high-toned home-staying elan an
uneasy suspicion, to be allayed only by Time’s
soothing touch.
Probably the mistake arose from a commission
given by the damsel in question to a Melb. cos-
tumi&re in anticipation of the Hobart Exhibition
festivities. Which suggests that perpetrators of
“ Carnival studies,” so popular of late, require no
knack of singling out the successes of Flemington
fashion-displays, but rather an intimate acquaint-
ance with the order-books of popular modistes.
The Hopetouns still rusticate at Wiridgil, the
Countess apparently not having quite recovered
from her alarming encounter with Wilfred, the
dog—an anarchistic tyke which bit her knee the
other day.
Just now the course of religion runs unusually
smooth at Camperdown. Sectarian jealousies have
temporarily vanished, the church lambs browsing
amicably in the thorny dogmatic pastures of the
kirk, and the kirk kye lying down in peace beside
the slumbrously still waters of the church.
This brief armistice is due to the example of the
Wiridgil inmates, who patronise each establish-
ment in turn, their orisons being shared by wor-
shippers of all creeds and conditions in such
numbers that the other tabernacle (whichever it
happens to be) is for the time quite deserted.
The anniversary of Carlyle’s birth afforded the
Salon an excuse for an especially gay gathering,
though, as a matter of fact, the Bruin Sage did
not begin his troubles until the following day.
But that’s where womanly ingenuity comes in.
The hostess, anticipating history to suit her own
convenience, climaxed the moveable feast with an
ice-cream refection. It was a little difficult to see
the connection until it was explained in a crisp
paper, read during the afternoon, that the Hero
of the day had been a life-long martyr to “ bilious
dyspepsia.” A comedietta from the pen of a
local editress, which enlivened the Carlyle ffite,
was laughable enough, promising well for the
brightness of the authoress’ just-out book of short
tales.
A certain Australian University professor last
year gave an order for certain essays of Addison’s
to be included in the matriculation text-book for
1895, under the impression that the edition he
named was an expurgated one. Now that the
book arrives, it is discovered that the professor’s
memory had failed him—the edition is an un-
Bowdlerised one. An attempt was made to with-
hold its publication, but as six months will elapse
ere another book can be prepared (that University’s
text-books, it would seem, have to be printed in
Hingland) the volumes must go out with all the
attractive passages left in for the wicked boys to
grin at and the girls to blush over during dinner-
hour.
Mrs. Silas Harding has purchased (for, it is said,
.£13,000) Bracknell, the palatial late Toorak resi-
dence of Matthew Davies. It was mortgaged for
<£20,000, and cost at least .£40,000. The lady was
saleswoman at Melb. Exhibition, and, at its close,
visited Geelong as traveller in diamond jewellery.
She there met Silas Harding, a rich, old and
eccentric squatter, who married her, and at his
death left her residuary-legatee to the tune of
about half-a-million, untrammelled by any restric-
tions. As a wife, even censorious and envious
Geelong cannot detect a flaw in Mrs. Harding.
Her story is a true romance.
In the grounds of a “ mansion ” in a Melbourne
suburb I see notices warning intruders to “ Beware
of mantraps.” Now, there are several grown-up
daughters at that house.

Daylesford (Vic.) police, the other day, cleaned

The N.S.W. Government certainly should
suppress those coupon competitions which an-
nounce a Xmas gift upon condition that a penny
stamp is enclosed with the coupon. A sporting
print gave a tenner on the Melb. Oup in this way
and scooped in .£l4O in penny stamps. This game
is surely more in want of abolition than the missing-
word competitions ever were.
The Frenchmen in Melbourne came out
strong at the funeral of M. Poutiata, the Russian
Consul. Expensive wreaths were sent by the
French Consul, the local director of the Comptoir
d’Escompte de Paris, and L’Alliance Franoaise.
None of these political mourners, however, were
so carried away by national sentiment as to kiss
the coffin of the poor little anti-Repubiican.

A Victorian jury has returned a verdict of
“not guilty” in the case of Jane Chrosier, the
girl who gave such a frank and thrilling account
of how she, at the instigation of the family
generally, split the skull of her sister’s illegitimate
infant with a spade, whereupon its brains were
eaten by hens. The court’s decision was that
Jane’s confession was only a hysterical romance,
and that she wanted to be hanged and to get her
portrait in the evening papers out of a certain
Deadwood Dick species of cussedness. The young
lady should make a soulful wife for somebody
when she grows up.
Every day now the cable informs us that
one or other of the London papers— i.e., one of
the staff on one or other of the London papers—
approves or disapproves of such things as the
Wairarapa verdict, or the test-match team of
cricketers, or Sid. Gregory’s innings, or something
else on which a bumptious English opinion,
uttered in utter ignorance of the facts, can have
no value whatever. And the mulish dailies print
these opinions in large type, and bow down to
them, and write leading articles to show their
errors, as if anybody in Australia cared two
snakes about them. The process of freeing our-
selves from the Drivel of our Fathers is very slow
and painful.

What a comment on “reconstruction” is the
clause in Premier Turner’s Ineoine-tax Bill, entitling a
taxable subject to deduct from his or her income the calls
paid during the year to liquidating companies and banks
“ the shares of which have no market-value 1” Consider-
ing that such calls are supposed to represent so much
additional interest in a sound and prosperous business,
the audacity of the clause was magnificent* It called
upon Parliament to admit that certain banks have no
chance of living, and that every penny paid on account of
ordinary shares is lost to the payer. Parliament admitted
it without hesitation.

The determination to reduce the interest on
deposits in N.S.W. Government Savings Banks to 3 per
cent, on deposits at call, and 4 per cent, on those fixed for
twelve months, practically makes the savings of the work-
ing classes worth only 3 per cent. Not one person
in a thousand of this class is able to give a deposit for
twelve months in advance. Savings-bank history is, in
the main, a story of lives of putting in and taking out, of
climbing up and sliding back. Only the classes for which
savings banks were never intended can take advantage of
the 4 per cent.

The Bulletin keeps on badly wanting to know
why the Australian hanks are not required to keep at
least half their reserve-funds in Australian 3J per cent.
Government securities. It would be a guarantee that so
much, at all events, of the reserve really existed, that it
c uld be found when wanted, and that it was earning
r asonable interest ; and it would enable the State to
raise more money locally with which to pay off the
B itish creditor as he falls due. Most other countries
compel their financial institutions to do something of the
kind. Even British consols keep up their value mostly
because trustees and others are compelled by law to invest
in them, and it is mainly owing to this forced circulation
that J. Bull now borrows money at 2J per cent.

It is announced that the National Fire Insur-
ance Co.—a good-sized and hitherto prosperous concern—
has been bought up by the London and Lancashire. Thus
another Australian office goes out of the business, and an
E iglish institution absorbs its connection. This process
of annexation is going on so steadily that the English
e mpanies seem likely, by-and-bye, to have a monopoly
of the business in Australia, and meanwhile the export of
1 rofits to pay divs. to English shareholders proceeds
aily. This utterly useless leakage of Australian money
to England is only a comparatively small item among
many, but still it represents a continuous drain for which
this country receives absolutely nothing in return. When
will some Protectionist Government live up to its prin-
ciples by enaoling that no fire insurarce co. that hasn’t
its headquarters in Australasia shall he permitted to do
business in this country? And why shouldn’t Govern-
ment start a fire-office? If it can successfully run a
colossal life-office, as in Maoriland, why should it not run
a colossal fire-office ?

The Australian Widows’ Fund is rousing its
members to agitate for the exemption of mutual life
a-suranoe societies from the land-tax. The plea is that a
life soe’eties’ lands and mortgages are the property of
hundreds of individual members, and in most cases each
man’s share is so small as to fall within the exemption,
limit. The plea has some show of reason as a matter ot
abstract justice, but the bottom falls out ot it as a matter
of expediency, and politics, at the best, are mainly a
matter of expediency. So many building societies and'
hanks and other corporations would get through on the
s.me plea that there would be very little land-tax left.
Nobody ever yet fixed up a tax which would absolutely
square with the doctrines of abstract justice, and nobody
ever will.

A person calling himself “Septuagenarian”
loiters into the columns of the Melb. dailies, bemoaning
the lot of the. widows and the aged who may he called
upon to supply income-tax under the new Act. They
will have to pay double, says the alleged ancient, because
they derive their incomes from interest, instead of per-
sonal exertion, and the effect of this inequality will be
their immediate departure for foreign lands. Considering
that the widow and the aged are to enjoy the same
amount of exemption as a personally-exerting victim
who has a wife and 15 children to support, the moan of
the geyser falls rather flat. Yet it is a significant fact
that the editors who print his letter forget to give him
ids due in a footnote. A widow with, say, £5OO a year,
who fled the country to escape Turner’s income-tax,
would be taking a long journey on very slight provoca-

A scheme for hurrying up the slow and melan-

the liquidator of a big concern is often paid by salary,
therefore it is to his’ interest to keep on liquidating. Or

his interest to spend £lOO in law expenses to recover a dis-
puted debt of £2O. Also, he can’t he made to give any
definite information about how things are going on

Here is an interesting fact for statesmen to con-
sider: A country which borrows money abroad and has
to export the interest can only raise the said interest by
selling produce in a foreign market—in fact, it pays, to
all' intents and purposes, in produce. But prices of Aus-
tralian produce have diminished so greatly in recent
years that the burden of interest on the N.S. Wales loans
floated between 1872 and 1891 has already increased, in
effect, from £1,600,000 to £2,300,000 annually. Also the
loans were received mostly in English produce ac high
prices in days gone by, and they will have repaid
if they ever are repaid—by the sale of Australian produce
at low prices in the future, so that the effect will be the
same as if the prices had remained unchanged, and Aus-
tralia had to pay £l5O for every £lOO borrowed. By-and-
bve as the drop goes on, the effect will be the same as if
this country had to pay £2OO, or even £3OO, for every
£lOO borrowed. It is impossible to count the number of
different ways in which the borrowing curse comes home
to roost. . „

The Victorian Government thinks of enacting—
if its good intentions are not overset by the Legislative
Council—that in future the local banks should he required
to show live and dead business separately in their balance-
sheets. The former coasists principally of properties
which have been taken over, often at a loss, in satisfac-
tion of overdue advances, and these have hit lu rto been
included in the bewildering item of “Bills discounted
and all other debts due to the bank ” —which item
generally forms nine-tenths of the total assets. The
proposal is at least a move in the right direction. A lot
of light would be thrown on sundry mysterious institu-
tions if they were compelled to show separately: (l)The
nominal value of town and city properties actually on
hand; (2) the value of country properties on hand; (3)
the amount of bills under discount; (4) the amount of
loans on live mortgages ; (5) the amount of interest over-
drffe ; (6) the amount of interest accrued ; (7) the amount
of advances on miscellaneous securities; and (8) the
amount of miscellaneous securities taken over through
non-payment of advances. Probably there will be several
more panics before legislation reaches this point, but it
will arrive there, or somewhere thereabouts, sooner or
later.

Lendrin Economist suggests that “ British
holders of colonial stock should appoint a committee to
advise colonial Governments when desirable.” The
fatherly J. Bull always wants to advise somebody, but in
this case the offer won’t he accepted. The only thing that
a committee would be likely to advise is that “ colonial
Governments ” should pay up regularly, and look
pleasant, and shouldn’t attempt to float loans in Aus-
tralia on any account, hut should put them all on the
London market at 4 per shent. Finance is practically a
fight to a finish between the borrower and the lender, and
the Economist’s suggestion is very like Corbett forming
himself into a committee to advise Fitzsimmons when
their much-advertised “scrap ” comes off.

have recovered money of the existence of which they
never had—and, under the old system, never would have

a depositor died leaving a balance, the banks made no
enquiry as to his heirs, but simply collared the money
wherever possible in approved banking style. No wonder

“Johnnie M‘Williams ”) of a “wild man, or
gorilla,” having been encountered. The animal
bolted up a range, tearing up dust with its claws,
bellowing like a bull whenever it struck its feet in
vaulting over logs.
Parry-Okeden, magistrate in charge of the
disturbed districts under Q. Coercion Act, refuses
to endorse the squatters’ version of the late strike.
Okeden’s tongue is tied by his Govt, office, and
he can’t say as much as he would like; but he
does go so far. as to say that the men “ were not
altogether in the wrong,” and that “ there is a lob
to be said for therouseabonts in raising the pro'test
they did against the reduction of an already
miserable screw.” Considering the source of this
opinion, the strikers need ask for little further
justification.
Xmas holidays smash weekly-newspaper
arrangements. The Bulletin, for* example, is
generally printed on Wednesday and sent
round the earth for sale on Thursday; but
this week Tuesday and Wednesday are post-
official dies non , and the authorities are pledged
nob to handle any mail matter beyond a limited
morning delivery. The consequence is that The
Bulletin has practically to be made two days in
advance of its usual time. This explanation will
account for any want of up-to-dateness observ-
able.
Daring a private colloquy in the S. A.
Assembly on the occasion of one of the all-night
sittings at the close of the session, Premier King-
ston called Opposition-leader Downer “a damned
humbug.” Grainger overheard the remark and
reported it to the Speaker, his excuse being that in
September, 1884, Playford, then head of the
Ministry in which Kingston was Attorney-
General, reported a similar conversational remark
made by him to a brother member under like
circumstances. It is not often that even political
grudges are nursed so long as that. Grainger,
who seldom remembers a good turn, has, however,
an everlasting menaory for injuries.
DR: SIR MORELL MACKENNIN.
The late eminent specialist being asked h«w he
accounted for the Small number of suecessful enres
in throat diseases, gave the following answer :
“ Our patients are, in most cases, under the in-
fluence of an irresistible habit, against whicti
advice is of no avail. The first rule for a diseased
throat is to abstain from smoking during the early
period of lha treatment; gradually, as the patient
improves, I allow him a very mild whiff until he
has completely recovered. But, what happens?
No sooner is he free from tire acute pain tlwn he
lights his old pipe, causing the essence of concen-
trated juice to come in contact with his still
delicate throa’t, and resulting in a new and more
dangerous inflammation.” Frossnrd’s Cavour
Cigars just answer the purpose. Being mild and
aromatic, they are harmless and give pleasure,
while the price of a packet of eight, only one
shilling, puts them within the range of all.

The work on which Robert Louis
Stevenson was engaged at the time of
his death was “ The Lord Justice Clerk ”
—a special study of th,e times and career
of the ingenuous and brutal Scotch
Judge, Braxfield. It was on his last
visit to Sydney that Stevenson deter-
mined on the prosecution of this work,
the idea being suggested to him by the
coincidence that the room in which he
was conversing with a Sydneyite was
built upon the site of Maurice Mar-
garet’s cottage. Margaret was one of
the famous body of Scottish martyrs—
Muir, Skirving, Fysshe Palmer, Gerrald

Braxfield for “seditious practices.”

Boothby.
The ancient Cassidy, who lately died in
Yass (N.S. W.) district, had been drawing a pen-
sion since 1827 for being shot by a bushranger.
The story goes that another ex-constable, who
lately died after long drawing a similar pension,
obtained it for “plugging” a ’ranger with slugs
after the outlaw had died from a shot from his
own pistol.
W. W. Tarleton, the long, gaunt, un-
happy-looking barrister who died in Sydney the
other day, came of a well-known Tasmanian
family, and was originally an Anglican clergy-
man, but went over to Rome a score of years ago.
He was not very successful at the bar, but he did
his level best, and was of so amiable a nature
that the news of his death was received with
genuine regret.
Frank Iredale, N.S.W. batsman, whose
portrait is printed in this week’s Bulletin, first
played cricket in earnest with the Balmains.
Afterwards hedrifted into theßelvideres,of which
club he was long a prominent member; he now
plays with the Central Cumberland electorate.
Most followers of cricket thought he should have
been included in the last team which toured Eng-
land, but the selectors opined differently, giving
as their reason that Iredale was not strong
enough to stand the racket of an English trip.
Iredale is a sure catch, an especially good
fieldsman in the “out-field,” and Ids consistent
scoring with the bat has shown that his many
admirers were right in their contention that he
was worthy a place in any Australian representa-
tive team. In his first big match Iredale made 5 7
against Victoria, and after scoring consistently
ever since he has placed the hall-mark upon his
cricketing career in the last two matches. Play-
ing for N.S. Wales against the Englishmen, he
made 133 in an innings ; and last week he put
together 81 in his first innings in the test-match.
Messrs. Blackio and Sons, of Glasgow, the
well-known publishers of boys’ books, will shortly
issue a book of Australian adventure by Ernest
Favenc ; Percy Spence has been commissioned to
illustrate it. The story, The Bulletin under-
stands, deals with the supposed fate of Leich-
hardt’s lost party and the mysterious cave-draw-
ings discovered by Grey. It will be a change to
have a boys’ book written and illustrated by two
men who really ought to know a little about
Australia.
The ’Murkan widow of the Duke of Marl-
borough (that literary duke, who used to paint his
first wife’s eye and elope with the spouses of his
brother peers) is credited with an intention to
marry Lord Bill Beresford, the Indian sport.
His lordship is a dashing hero of 47, and his wild
oats have been sown. The marriage would form
a family connection between Salmon Wilson and
the Marquis of Queensberry, and so give the
proud Victorian absentee a further interest in the
divorced nobility. Queensberry and the late
Marlborough (Lady Sarah Wilson’s relative) are
responsible for three divorced wives between
them.
Miss VIRGINIA VI VIENNE, of the Bland

Matt, Nolan, youngest member of the
Nolan family of pioneer prospectors—the Nolans
were either first, or among the first, at Mt.
Brown, the Barrier, Croydon, Zeehan, and New

gardie. Though first everywhere they made no
money. The pioneer, alas, seldom does. It is
the Cohen who comes after him that gets the pool.
W. M‘Manus, whose portrait is here pub-
lished, is a splendid specimen of the greyhound

record for the hop-step-and-jump—49ft. but
the actual jump, from toe to heel, measured over
50ft. As The Bulletin pointed out at the time,
the ground was none too favorable, so it is pro-
bable that M'Manus on a pinch could beat the
present (his own) record.
Stoddarfc is a phenomenal Englishman,
being unassuming. Naturally, public applause on
the cricket-field is dear to him, and it adds zest to
the gratification he feels when he makes a century
against great bowlers. But off the field compli-
ments with him are out of place ; and, if he hates
anything, it is the extravagance of a toaster. When
Premier Reid subjected him to all the offensiveness
of direct personal flattery, Stoddart’s face was a
study. Poor Stoddart! which would he prefer—•
“a pair of spectacles ” or that one eye-glass ?
The recently-deceased Dr. Beaven Rake, of
Trinidad Leper Asylum, averred that leprosy was
associated with a very resistant bacillus, by which
the disease was communicated to others, but nob
to a great extent. He advocated the segregation
of lepers, and suggested that this might be facili-
tated by allowing or contriving marriages between
lepers, justifying his suggestion by the fact that
70 per cent of leprous couples are sterile. An
examination of leprosy-statistics further demon-
strates that less than six per cent of recorded cases
show inherited diseases, all other cases being those
of the offspring of perfectly healthy parents.
Of the late Lieut.-001. William Collard
Smith, ex-Minister for Mines (Vic.), who died
at Brunswick (Vic.) lately, it used to be told
that he once waited on David Syme, of Melbourne
Age, and said : “ I see that you always call me in
your paper, ‘ Mr. W. C. Smith ; ’ I wish that
you’d simply refer to me as ‘ Lieut.-Col. Smith.’ ”
“But aren’t your initials ‘W.C.S. ?’” “Yes,
but —er ” “Well, what?” “Don’t you see?
‘ W. C. Smith ’ —er —sounds—er, rather—er ”
Syme (blandly): “Well?” Smith (dramati-
cally) : “ Well ! ”
Sid. Gregory, nicknamed “ the Baby ” by
N.S.W. cricketers, scales 9st. 31b. and stands sft.
sin. The smallest man of the team, he stood up
best against the lightning deliveries of big
Richardson, and although that bowler puzzled
him much at times, he scored more freely off him
than off the other English bowlers. He has good
cause for punishing Richardson, for once when the
Australians played Surrey, a ball from the fast
bowler struck Gregory full on the forehead, flew
up, and was caught by a fieldsman 30 yards away.
Gregory was too stunned to hear the fieldsman’s
appeal for a catch. Speaking of the interest
taken in cricket, he says: “ English girls
understand the game better than Australian;
but English crowds take less interest than Aus-
tralian people, and in place of * barracking ’
they clap.” Gregory is possibly the best field in the
world. His returning is perfection ; he can throw
the ball 120 yards, which is an extraordinary per-
formance when compared with the giant Bonnor’s
best, viz., 124£yds. Briggs, the strongest thrower
on the English side, can only reach 110yds.
Gregory expects the Australians to have the best
of the test matches. “ In Australia we can beat
the English ; in England they can beat us.” Sid.
was born and bred in the atmosphere of cricket,
the name of Gregory having been deeply graven
on the scroll of Australian cricket fame by father
Ned and uncles Dave and Charley. Young Sid.
took to the family failing as a young duck takes
to water, and when scarcely out of his knicker-
bockers was playing in senior cricket. As a
deadly “throw-in,” Gregory runs the old-time
champion, Charley Bannerman, “to a head.” At
the beginning of the present season Gregory was
“ going off,” but he awoke to the gravity of the
situation, and after making big scores in club
cricket, reached the goal of most cricketers’
ambition by scoring a double century in an innings
in the first English test match.
Lieut. Chetwynd, the Ringarooma scape-
goat, seems to have had harsh treatment. The
evidence of Lieut. Hibberd says :
Lieut. Chetwynd was on duty almost continuously dur-
ing t he 29th and 30th August, and during the previous 10
days he had been on duty almost as continuously. . . .
At the commencement of the last cruise witness thought
it advisable to suggest to the captain that another officer
should be detailed for the watch Lieut. Chetwynd was
keeping.
Thus, Lieut. Chetwynd was practically dismissed
his ship because he could not keep awake after 12
days’ “ almost continuous ” duty.
The U.S. Army and Navy Journal has
the following, by an English engineer on the
Chinese cruiser Yang-Wai, re the treatment of
those disabled in an encounter with the Japanese:
There were but two white men aboard the cruiser—
myself and the surgeon. As soon as the vessel was out of
danger from the shells of the Japanese gunboats, he and
I, with a corps of the surgeon's assistants, set about
clearing up the terrible mess on the main deck. Wherever
we found a man hopelessly wounded, the surgeon gave him
instant relief from his agony. He cat ried an atomiser
filled with prussic acid, and as soon as his hasty examina-
tion of a hopeless case was finished, he sprayed the poison
into the man's mouth and nostrils. The dying men
craned their necks forward eagerly in their desire to
escape from the torture they suffered. There were very
few of the wounded who were not put out of their miseiy
by the surgeon’s atomiser. One of the most distressing
features of an engagement like this is the terrific noise
aboard a modern man-of-war fairly in action. The Y»ng-Wai
fought all the time with one screw turning slowly, her fires
raked clean, and the steam blowing off like the shrieking
of a gale. The scream of the shells, the thud and the
vibration as they struck the cruiser, the terrific roar as
they burst, and the deafening noise and concussion of our
own guns, made it utterly impossible for anything else
to be heard aboard the vessel. To my dying day I shall
remember that July 12th, and, most of all, the horrible
noise and the scene on the bloody main deck.
The world is getting more civilised. In Nelson’s
time they simply threw the wounded sailor over
the side alive, and the sharks got him. Now they
give him prussic acid with a squirt.
The retrenchment party in N.S. Wales
succeeded, after a number of exceptionally
long sittings, in “saving”—the sums “saved”
will probably all come up smiling again on the
supplementary estimates —a little over .£7OOO out
)f an estimated expenditure of about .£4,800,000.
Taking it all round, this will just about pay for the
printing and setting of the windy speeches about
nothing in particular by those brand-new leaders
of the retrenchment party, Richard Sleath and
Foghorn Miller. It is entirely due to these two
heroes that so little genuine retrenchment has been
effected. When the estimates first came on this
pair of statesmen rushed at them like bulls at a
gate, moving unreasonable reductions without any
discrimination whatsoever. This led to an under-
standing between the two old parties, with the
result that “sooner than hand the business over to
these fellows ” the Opposition voted solidly with
the Government.

POLITICAL
POINTS.
Hia Holiness the N.S.W. Postmaster-
General.
Premier Turner promises that a Bill to
extend the franchise to women will be introduced
in the Victorian Parliament next year.
The present Queensland Government has
twice been saved from defeat by the Speaker’s
casting-vote, and once by a majority of one vote
only! „
It looks as if the author of those tremen-
dous Sunday paper tirades against a Major-
General was inspired by a very big politician
indeed.
Premier Turner, though successful, is half
worried to death, and is strongly disposed to
throw up the sponge. His law-partner predicted
as much.
Bryan O’Loghlen, Q. 0., is being com-
forted in his political exile with briefs from the
Vic. Crown. One would have thought that, after
the Matthew Davies nolle prosequi, the Crown had
lost confidence in Bryan as a legal adviser.
Now that there is a vacancy in Christ
Church (Sydney) incumbency, the N.S.W. Govern-
ment should take steps to finally settle the ques-
tion of the tenure under which the Church holds
its glebe lands. The question is one of huge prac-
tical importance to the State.
Minister Carruthers told a Sydney D.T.
reporter how grieved he felt that £lOOO had been
knocked off the vote for beautifying the Kuring-
gai Chase reserve; but, says the D.T. in effect,
the amount will be spent on it all the same.
“ Responsible ” Government!
Australian Star, after quoting some re-
marks made about Commandant Hutton by ex-
Premier Dibbs, says:—“lf the statements are
true ” &c. What an “if ”to come from the lead-
ing columns of the champion sycophant to the
ennobbled renegade Republican!
Jacob Garrard says there are no round
pegs in square holes in the N.S.W. Education
Department. This does not exactly disprove the
common allegation that there are many square
jiegs in round holes in that branch of the service ;
and that Jacob himself is the most rectangular
of the lot.
The S.A. Woman Suffrage Act—which
The Bulletin noticed when it passed the Council
some months ago—is now through the Assembly,
and only waits the formality of Victoria’s assent
to be law. The Might of Man will soon follow
the festive plesiosaurus and the cheerful ptero-
dactyl to the realm of Kingdom Gone.
Frank Madden, about the
most aggressive mediocrity in
theViclorian Assembly, wants
the country to “ ask time from
its creditors ’’ instead of levy-
ing new taxation. To ask for
time means that the country
would pay part of the interest
as it falls due and give its
creditors debentures which
would bear interest in their
turn—for the balance; in other
words, part of the interest
would be paid and the rest
added to the public debt. The
result is exactly the same as
if Victoria floated a new loan
and paid the interest out of it,
only the obtuse Madden can’t
see a simple thing like that.
Besides, unless more revenue
is raised it isn’t time that
Victoria wants, but eternity.
Another N.S.W. Civil
Service Commission is sitting,
and drawing big fees, and pro-
fessing to devise new means qt
economy. The other day it
examined Under • Secretaries
Critchett Walker and Kirk-
patrick, and it will examine
several dozen other officials
later on, and then draft a
stupendous report. This is the
old way of tackling the subject
of retrenchment. The new
way would be to appoint a
keen-witted and reliable man,
under some pretence or °tber,
to each department —he could
be sent to whitewash the ceil-
ings, or fresco the walls, or to
copy out half-a-ton of old docu-
ments, or anything and let
him bring in his report quite
unobtrusively at the end of
six months or so. He would
probably find out a whole lot
of things which even the best
Under - Secretary, sitting
placidly in his own apartment,
never sees or even dreams of.
A solicitor who is also a
justice of the peace has a big
start over the common or_ gar-
den attorney. Petty criminals
always engage him, he having
the power to hold them to bail,
and accept any bondsmen he
chooses; besides having freer
entree to the gaol. In the interests of fair play, no
solicitor should be a justice.
By the new S.A. Suffrage Act, adul
woman in that province can not only exercise a
vote, but may be elected to and sit in Parliamen .
Sexual weakness and idiosyncrasy had to oe
specially allowed for by clauses permitting women
resident more than three miles from a polling-
booth, and females who may be near that anxious
time for which their lords are partly responsible,
to take advantage of the Absent Voters’ Act and
record their votes under its machinery. Shades of

A correspondent:—The Brutus-like purity
of the Reid Government received new illustration
recently, when the brother of a prominent Free-
trade member was appointed to an inspectorship
of (say) tomatoes, for which his qualifications are,
to say the least, dubious. Roughly speaking, this
must make the 900th inspector of nothing-in-par-
ticular in N.S.W. civil service.
Out of every 30 adult males in South Aus-
tralia one is a Justice of the Peace. And out of
every 30 Justices of the Peace one is a Member of
Parliament. The only gentlemen in the Assem-
bly who do not possess the affix are Opposition-
leader Downer and Lands Minister Gillen. The
latter is a country storekeeper, and he doesn’t
wish to offend his customers by fining them 25..6d.
If the yarn told by Mike Duffy, M.P., a s
to his being snapped out of the late historical
division in the Q. Assembly by the dropping of
the bar by the Sergeant-at-Arms, is to be taken
seriously, then Premier Nelson owes his continu-
ance of office and fat salary to a pure fluke, and
occupies one of the most contemptible positions
that polities ever doled out to a supposedly free
leader.
The Queensland Govt,, in selecting repre-
sentatives for the Federal Council meeting, has
for the first time on record ignored the Opposi-
tion. Formerly, representatives were chosen
from both sides of the House. The explanation
on this occasion will probably be that there is no
Opposition tV select from. It is a point of Bris-
bane Fat Main etiquette not to be aware of
Glassey’s existence.
Bartlett, M.P., affirmed in the S.A.
Assembly, the other day, that every lawyer in the
House obtained a big fat fee to look after the
interests of the capitalists when the Pastoral Bill
was under consideration. “ When you don’t
understand a thing that the lawyers are fighting
hard for,” said Bartlett, “ be on the safe aide and
vote against it.’’ And Solomon, in all his glory,
never uttered a wiser precept.
Queensland brewers were registered under
the Beer Duty Act—repealed. The Liquor Act
enacts that no brewer but a registered brewer can
sell beer. Query : Since the Act under which all
Bananaland brewers were registered has been
repealed, are there any registered brewers at all
in Bananaland ? Therefore, can any Queensland
brewer legally sell beer? A teetotaller with a
turn for laying unexpected informations might try
this point.
Among the N.S.W. Loan Estimates for the
year are some curious items such as : railway trial
surveys, £9OOO (as the railways may never be
built, or may be built on some altogether new
route, this can’t be classed among reproductive
public works) ; repairs to mint machinery, &c.,
£5OOO ; thinning out forests, £50,000 ; patching
and altering an old dredge, £6500; and a few more
trifles of a similar character. The great rule of
N.S.W. finance is to charge nothing to revenue
wliich can, with any show of decency, be put into
the Loan Estimates, and though the above
examples are nothing like so bad as many things
done in the past, the Assembly should kick none
the less.
AT THE ALTAR.
During the year the lowest number of blades maintained
at the various depots at any time was 404 and the highest
number 502. Three marriages took place during the year ;in
one of them the contracting parties were named respectively

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-

when absent from duty through sickness, the Vic.
Govt, has, in six months, made over £6OO out of
the police-force alone. This is like waiting till a

disproof of the existence of the much-talked-about

A new Ass society has arisen in Brisbane
from the ashes of the insolvent old one. Theeminent
Bulcock is chief engineer; low-wages White is
second ; and not a man on the committee weighs
less than 25-stone of Fat. The gags are the same
ohl gags about “opposing class legislation ” — i.e.,
anything but property class legislation; and
securing representatives, not delegates, for Parlia-
ment—i.e., property representatives.
On 18th December the N.S.W. Assembly
referred the Jerilderie-Berrigan railway to the
Public Works Committee. And on the 19th the
Public Works Committee rushed together, and
took half-an-hour’s evidence about it, and charged
the usual fee for a sitting. It was the only job on
hand, and the committee apparently was m a
hurry to get at it, and yet wanted to make it last
as long as possible, and it succeeded admirably in
both respects.
Dear Bulletin, —lf Gov. Duff is worth
£lO,OOO a year, what is Mr. Eddy’s value? Some-
thing over £1,000,000, I think. If ever N.S.
Wales was a fool it is in allowing the Chief Com-
missioner to go for the sake of a few paltry
hundreds or thousands. He is the one man in
Australia at present in my opinion whose worth
can hardly be estimated. If I had my way, I’d
put him on pretty nearly every State department
to remodel it—and hang your Royal Commissions.
—Yours, Native.
Mr. D. Ham, M.L.0., says that there are
plenty of men outside willing to do the Vic. Civil-
service work for less than a third of the present
salaries. No doubt. There are also plenty of
men camping in the parks and gardens who would
be willing to do Ham’s legislative work for the
privilege of being allowed to go to sleep periodi-
cally upon the cushioned-seats of the Legislative
Council. Mr. Ham’s idea seems to be that Vic-
toria will never be truly great until its Govern-
ment becomes the boss sweater of the province.
Pratt, M.L.C., has followed the lead of his
local chieftain, Sargood, by resigning his position
in the Vic. Ministry. The gentleman’s position
was strictly honorary. Nobody had remembered
Pratt’s existence until he advertised it.
Whisper told the balmy wind,
“ Mr. Pratt has just resigned 1 ”
Which brought the question mocking—
“ Who the doooe is Mr. Pratt,
Will you kindly tell us that ?
And is the country rocking ? ”

“Why should not boys have liberty as well
as men ? People should be allowed to work
as long as they like. If they chose to work
10 or 12 hours a day, they should be per-
mitted to do so.” And the N.S.W. Legis-
lative Council said —“Amen!” Of course, by
the Council’s logic, no one ever works 10 or 12
hours a day because he must do it or else get the
“sack;” he only does it because he wants to.
“Liberty,” in the bright lexicon of “Jannery”
Davies, always means liberty to work 12 hours a
day.
Patterson, big and burly, ruled his Parlia-
ment with bluster and brag, but achieved nothing.
Turner, dapper and blushing, has the appearance
of yielding all along the line, but the work gets
done all the same, and his bills get through. He
refuses to be led away from his point by inter-
ruptions, is placidly deaf to small insults, lets
personal explanations slide, pacifies indignant
cranks personally instead of leaving them to move
the adjournment of the House to air their
grievances, and keeps the Parliamentary machine
always oiled. A Premier who could part from
Sargood without telling that bore what a bump-
tious mockery he was is a marvel of good-
humored forbearance.
At time of writing notice has been given
in N.S.W. Assembly of a motion for the appoint-
ment to a seat on the paid Public Works Com-
mittee of Angus Cameron, the phoenixed person
who, having lately re-entered Parliament as an
out-and-out opponent of payment of members,
had the cast-iron effrontery to straightway run for
the Chairmanship of Committees —£800 a year
salary. He was fortunately shunted, and now has
the ineffable cheek to bob up again in a reach-out
which would adorn the career of the great Ameri-
can Pie Biter. And, mark you, this bull-hided
man Cameron, who started life as a working car-
penter and a workmen’s member, is all the time
pouching the .£3OO a year Parliamentary allowance
which he professes to regard as such an abomina-
tion. The Bulletin has no personal political
aspirations, but it would dearly like to address
N.S. W. Assembly for 20 minutes on the subject
of the resurrected A. Ca"' orn it Esq.
Sydney Tele-
graph remarks; “The
simple duty of the
(N. S. W.) Govern-
ment is to sweep
away at the earliest
possible moment the
whole protective sys-
tem, grain-duties in-
cluded.” The Bul-
let iN cordially
endorses this state-
ment. N.S. Wales
returned a Freetrade
Government, and it
deserves to have Free-
trade. It never has
had such a thing in
its entirety yet, but
it has asked for it,
and should get it
accordingly. So far,
however, there are no
signs of it coming
along. Apparently
the Reid Ministry,
like many previous
Ministriesin N.S.W.,
is afraid lest a brief
spell of pure and un-
ad ul terated F ree trade
would make an end
of Freetrade Govern-
ments altogether.
A monument of
colossal folly is the
Bundaberg - Glad-
stone (Q.) railway.
To please local au-
thorities, a bit was
built at each end. A
gap was then left
artistically in the
middle. No funds are
available to finish the
gap; the Gladstone
portion is rotting away ; railway-iron sufficient to
complete the line is also rotting away—altogether
a fine sample of political railway.
When N.S. W. metropolitan jury courts
rose for vacation last week, 33 suits were still un-
heard, and must now stand over for another term.
In one court no less than 21 cases were thus post-
poned. Nevertheless, several judges have been
“ holidaying ” off-and-on during the past term,
some even adjourning the court two hours before
time so as to get ready for a fete at Government
House, or some other social celebration. Thomas
Walker’s forlorn ambition to compile a time-table
for judicial functionaries presents an aspect, of
reasonableness when such facts are reviewed.
Premier Seddon (M.L.), who lately stated
that a K.C.M.G.-ship “ would come more grace-
fully at the close of a man’s political career,” has
begun to realise that his democratic constituents
have no good feeling towards a man to whom a
title comes at any time, whether gracefully or
Otherwise. His unlucky saying follows him like a’
shadow. At a recent function at Ahaura the
skeleton rose for the twentieth time, or more,
when a sour-looking citizen up-ended himself with
the old, old query: “Would the Hon. Mr.
Seddon accept a knighthood if it was offered
him?” Whereupon Premier Dick smote the
' 'vble with his mighty fist and answered “NO !!! ’’
N.S.W. Government has declaret. 1) that
it has no record of the Dibbs-Duff correspondence
respecting the Governor’s refusal to appoint cer-
tain nominees to the Legislative Council; (2) that
it has all the said correspondence, but that one
letter is officially private as between Duff and
Downing-street; (3) that it would be unfair to
Duff to publish the correspondence without this
“officially private” document; and (4) that
Downing-street’s leave to publish is being asked.
To which may be replied—(l) the N.S.W. Go-
vernment had the record all along; (2) the corres-
pondence has been printed by the Government
Printer ; (3j the printed copies have been shown
privately to political favorites.

CLEMENTS TONIC is a scientific chemical
food and restores the tissue wasted by the voca-

FLETCHER’S PILLS cure heartburn, back-
ache, headache, liver terpidity, dyspepsia, and all
complaints of the stomach and bowels.
These two remedies have been thoroughly tested
in all the hot countries of the world. They are
sold at a price within the reach of all people.
Evidence is forwarded free on recipt of name and
address that will satisfy the most sceptical as to
their virtues. They are sold everywhere, but care
must be taken that the genuine are obtained or
the money and time are wasted and the disease
made so much the more serious.

An Australian Supreme Court Judge once
placed on record his roundaboutly-expressed
opinion that, under given circumstances, “any
man worthy of the name” would deliberately com-
mit perjury in order to save lovely but luckless
woman from the slow agonies of death on the
social antheap. Within the last few days, a man
who lied thus before a Divorce Court, in the
endeavor to save his sister from being officially
mantled in shame, was rewarded by another Judge
with a long term of penal servitude.

One day recently, when C.J. Prendergast
was sitting in the Supreme Court, Wellington,
with a long list of motions in banco before him,
he found most of the counsel not ready to go on.
The chief asked the cause of the unreadiness, and
inquired if any races were being held. “ I think
it is a tennis match, your Honor,” suggested the
junior counsel. “Tennis, tennis. Ah, when L
was a young man,” remarked the court, “we
found it necessary to work ; now they seem to do
nothing else but spend their afternoons chasing a
quinine pill around a cow-paddock.”

Chief Justice Madden, Vic., a bald and
astrachan-trimmed person, with the head .of- a
benevolent bruiser, and an elaborately spiked
moustache, has been advising the boys of S. Melb.
College to cultivate the Muses. “ Lovers,;’.’..said
his Honor, “ should learn the value of poetry in
raising their ideals, and then no one would ever
again put forward for serious discussion the ques-
tion, ‘ls marriage a failure ?’ ” And yet Shelley
and Byron, for instance, must have known some-
thing of the value of poetry in raising their ideals.
The fact appears to be exactly the opposite to
Judge Madden’s idea : the more poetry there is
infused into love’s young dream, the greater the
likelihood of a bad time after the prosaic awaken-
ing. No ordinary woman can ever be happy with
a poet-husband. The man who can provide Mary
Jane Smith with a Heaven on earth is the fat and
prosperous trader who drives her in his own buggy
to the races.

A certain Austra-
lian legislator has just
had an experience
wliich points an excep-
tionally large moral.
He had moved the
suspension of the
seventh Mosaic stand-
ing order in the ab-
rence of a certain eon«
stituent, but the hus-
band —as somehow or
other they generally do
—came home unex-
pectedly. Then fol-
lowed a scene which
was the most finished
performance of its kind
which any politician
has heard of for many
a day. The constituent
—a big man with
muscles like gum trees
—caught the legislator
by the scruff and gently
but firmly dragged him,
with only one garment
on, out into the street.
Then, after shaking
him, he ground his
skull on the pavement,
mopped up the gutter
with him, and tried to
put him head-foremost
down a sewer. Bub
apparently he wouldn t
fit the sewer, so he
was eventually left to.
drag his mangled form,
with the aforesaid gar-
ment on, home through
the moonlight as best
he could. In addition
to all which the cons-
tituent has taken im-
mediate proceedings for
divorce. The man who
would add legal insult
to such satisfactory
bodily injury is a
stranger to all the finer
feelings of a gentle-
man.
Mr. T. A. Westwood, the ex-Rue A us-

Another Adelaide gold-seeker, recently returned,
says that during his stay on the field he met eight

from. Sometimes there is some friend^or^casu.
acquaintance to follow the remains to the ceme-
tery ; oftener there isn’t. The coffins are made
mostly of deal boards. The cemetery is a howling
wilderness of dust. The graves average 2ft. deep,
and every time a new one is opened a stench arises
from the mouldering relics of mortality next door.
Sometimes there is a burial-service ; at other times
there is nothing but a violent hustle to get the
hot, lugubrious function over. Then the pub.-
keeper lets the deceased’s bed to the next comer,
and he sleeps in the deceased’s room, among the
deceased’s bedclothes, all of which are just as the
last tenant left them. There is little ceremony at
Coolgar<lie, not much sentiment, and no sanita-
tion. Dust and death, old meat-tins, huge, black
flies, ghosts, disease, ill-luck and gloom are the
prevailing characteristics of the new land of gold*

Once more Sydney University authorities
are advertising a reward for the conviction of the
person who stole certain examination-papers. In
this case the authorities should have done justice
to the printers, and made it known that no sus-
picion rests upon them. Considering the tempta-
tion, it is simply marvellous that notone confiden-
tial piece of work in ten thousand entrusted to
printers finds its way to persons who might make
improper use of it. Fully three weeks before the
stoppage of certain Australian banks in the panic
period of ’93, documents, which would have given
the whole miserable game away, were entrusted
to metropolitan printers, and yet nothing leaked
out. This is the more remarkable as the Typo-
graphical Association of N.S.W. had funds in-
vested with one of the falling banks to the amount
of .£6OO. •

The pathetic tale of Rue Australia keeps
cropping up in all manner of places._ The latest
phase of the tragedy concerns the wives of t_wo of
the.settlers. • They were left behind at the original
exodus when their husbands went on to Paraguay,
arrangements being made for them to follow when
the Royal Tar took its next cargo. When the
Tar returned it was announced that no married
women would be allowed on that trip, so they
waited and possessed their souls in patience until
the.v'essek made its third voyage. But there never
was,any third voyage, and the whole business fell
through. ' Their passages were already paid, and
their worldly aU was in the hands of the Associa-
tion, and the Association was insolvent and
practically burst-up. The ■ “ camp ”- at Leich-/
hardt, where a crowd of 17 weary expectants were
huddled into three rooms waiting for the im-
possible to happen, was shifted to Balmain, and
the Balmain camp was presently shifted altogether
by the bailiffs for non-payment of rent.
After .that the two, forlorn grass-widows
earned a" precarious existence for themselves
and their children by badly-paid toil, and
spent their spare time in haunting the office of tha
Rue Australia Association and inquiring about
that ship' which never returned. They can’t get
to Paraguay, and their husbands in Paraguay
can’t get back to them. They are referred
vaguely from Head to Gilbert Casey, and from
Gilbert Casey back to Head, and find both these
and many other boss pioneers equally hopeless.
Their only consolation is to think of the 70 or so
families, also victims of “true mateship,” who
are in the.same tight place. Rue Australia seems
to have laid a Plight upon everyonewho touched
the ill-fated and ill-managed enterprise.

A Victorian money-lender has got a
drinky Britisher in durance. Tne latter receives
a regular remittance which, by reason of his in-
firmity, Mosenstein is authorised to collect.
Moseustein has also an authority to receive his
letters. He is kept at one of Mosenstein’s houses
in charge of a housekeeper of the elderly Flossie
description. There is a “To Let” notice up, and
if anyone calls he is informed that the sodden
Britisher is not there, that the place is vacant, and
the Flossie is merely a caretaker. Consequently,
his local acquaintances never find him. And as
he simply lives to drink, and never wants to go
out, no one else is likely to get hold of him.
These methods enable Mosenstem to annex three-
fourths of the income, and, by-and-bye, when the
seedy remittance man dies of the whisky-disease,
he will probably get all of it.

of offence, the “ marriage question. ’ ‘

Mrs. President Wolstenholme’s “ vie ws ” on

political voting-power has really no more to do
with this matter than with knickerbockers, and
blue stockings. “Seek ye first the suffrage”
should be their word of order—and all these things
shall be added unto you—perhaps. By the way,

A Melb. suburb is named Pigopolis, for
Chicagoan reasons. The other Sunday, a new
preacher, unaware of the swinish genesis of the
locality, descended on the principal church. Its
foundations are laid in pork ; the pork people abso-
lutely own it. Some imp,made him select the
miracle of the herd of swine. Finding it caught
on, he enlarged with theories on the reason, dilat-
ing on the multiform diseases engendered by pork,
and the wisdom of the Jews.
Journalist : The W.C.T.U., Melb., with
its Mothers’-meeting for the lowly, recalls
similar meetings held awhile ago in Colling-
wood by very fashionable ladies. A gen-
teel comrade of mine used to report them
with enthusiasm, but I got the chance one
week, and pointed out that there were seven
ladies lecturing six women, in a crowded neighbor-
hood. My contention was that they were too
“stand-off,” and would never do any good on that
system. Whereupon the chief fair fugle-woman
wrote a bitter letter, “ and would have your re-
porter understand that, for a time being, we meet
these persons on a footing of perfect equality.”
To which my retort was that this Lady Bountiful
business, “fora time being,” was precisely what
the working women wouldn’t have at any price.

Sam uel Hordern, a sketch of whom
appear s in this issue, is the commodore
of the Prince Alfred Yacht Club —an
institution that has been established
some 27 years, and may be regarded as
the premier “live’’ yachting club in
Port Jackson. The Prince Alfred —a
name with a nasty anti-Australian taste
—numbers now some 80 odd members,
most of whom belong to the “ Royal ”
Yacht Squadron. “Sam,” as he is
familiarly called, has been identified
with yachting ever since he was able to
handle a tiller. He is now the owner of
two of the best steam yachts in Sydney
harbor. It was he who imported the
Cowes 2J-rater, Bronzewing, which easily
beat the Bulbul two or three times, and
which was purchased by “Mister” James
Fairfax, who, speaking generally, divides
with Sam Hordern the patronage of
local aquatic amateurs. It is pretty well
known that last year’s anniversary
regatta would have fallen through but
for Mr. Hordern, who has a special fancy
for the continued celebration of that
annual event. He has been for three
years president of the P.A.Y. Club,
and the present is his second term as
commodore. Local rowing also claims
Mr. Hordern as a patron. The Sydney
Rowing Club owes to him the Sam
Hordern boat. He is largely identi-
fied with the N.S. Wales turf, having
at Rand wick a training stable, wherein
are now between 30 and 40 horses, under
the care of Ike Barnshaw. Horse-racing
with Hordern is not a money-making
speculation, bub an outlet for super-
fluous energy and ample resources—some
of the prices paid by Sam for racing sires
border on the sensational—Nordenfeldt,
<£5000; Cannon, £2000; Realm (Sydney
Cup winner, ’92), <£2ooo ; being a few
examples. Mr. Hordern has placed a
100-guinea shield for competition in the
electoral cricket-matches this season, and
has given a 100-guinea trophy to be
shot for by the members of the Sydney
Gun Club. He is prominent amongst
N.S.W. breeders of stud-cattle, his
animals having carried off some of the
best prizes at the last metropolitan
agricultural show. A few weeks ago,
he gained the prize in pigeon-homing
from Melbourne to Sydney, and amongst
his recent triumphs in other exhibits
have been prizes fer canaries and for a
collie dog. Sam Hordern is the sole
member of the old firm of Anthony Hor-
dern and Sons, whose universal-provid-
ing establishment is its own best adver-
tisement.
One of Victoria’s imported military swag-
gerers, being a bachelor at the time of his appoint-

that if he undertook matrimony in the beastly

found a moneyed wife, as per anticipation, and
also in due course the “.wife and family” passage-
money was applied for. Fortunately, the family
hadn’t got higher than number one when the
warrior’s term expired - Shortly after this a
brother Himperial officer became engaged to a
local heiress, whereupon he rushed up to the Vic.
war office with a demand for the spinster’s passage-
money. However, in this case there had not been
a matrimonial clause in the agreement, so the
seventy guineas didn't come off.

Fashionable society is often very mean
and not ashamed, or, at least, not until it is found
out. At a recent concert in the Vic.- Prahran
Town Hall for a very hard-up charity, a youth
who had the causa much at heart, the courage
of his convictions, aqd some experience, stood
at the door with his collection - plate; and
when different groups of people in the very
height of fashion said they had left their purses
behind them, he referred them to the note on the
programme which said that a small contribution
would ensure admission. Then they had to face
the alternative of going away or admitting they
had got their purses. They all chose the latter,
because it was a “ society ” affair, and they
would rather pay 3d. than be out of it.

Moat women who have large families are
more or less religious. Most clergymen have large
families. Also, as a rule, they marry young, and
when they get into trouble, in nine cases out of
ten, it is through ill-judged and excessive hugging
of other men’s wives or sisters. Consistent church

Mr. T. J. Santety, Albury-st., Murrumburrah,
writes on June 13th, 1893: —About four
months ago I was greatly troubled with a con-
tinual languid feeling, also loss of appetite, costive-
ness; in fact, I felt myself hardly capable of carry-
ing on my usual business, owing to a tired feeling;
I awoke in the morning more unrefreshed than
when I went to bed. A friend of ujine, who was
boarding in the same house as me, who .had been
benefited by Clements Tonic for the above symp-
toms, advised me to try it; I did so, and am happy
to say that before I had finished the third bottle
all disagreeable symptoms had disappeared. lam
happy to say I have never bad any occasion to
take any medicine since. I consider it is one of
the greatest panaceas in the world to those suffer-
ing from indigestion or affection of the liver.
Thanking you for the great benefit I have derived
from the use of your wonderful Clements Tonic.
I remain, yours, &c., T. J. Santety, tailor, Albury-
street, Murrumburrah.

members, likewise, as a class, have larger familier
than the average. Church choirs are proverbially
“affectionate;” so are church members in general.
The most religious nations have a higher per-
centage of illegitima f e births than the least
religious. Most of the new and grotesquely
enthusiastic sects which spring up from time to
time have a certain amount of hugging in their
creed, and the members have a yearnful way of
calling each other “ brother ” and “ sister.” All
these, and many other facts of the same kind,
are evidences in support of the contention
that the religions instinct and the girl instinct
are mere varieties of the same feeling; in fact,
that they are the same instinct. The man
who has a yearning after pretty girls and tries not
to give way to it, becomes a parson and has a
large family. The man w' o hasn’t, becomes a
doctor and has no family, or else a very small one.
Materialists, and other unbelievers, as a rule,
have small families. No ordinarily-constituted
person can have the true yearnfulness after pretty
girls and yet be a materialist. These rules, by
the way, don’t apply much to Calvinists. Cal-
vinism, in its genuine form, is largely a scheme
for damning pretty girls, and the soulful variety
of person never belongs to that sect.

A Sydney pressman tells a strange storj
about a big Australian statesman whom he wai
once told off to interview. The statements of the
legislator were of such a reckless and incriminat-
ing character that the reporter’s hair fairly stood
on end. When he handed in his copy, the “sub”
promptly drew his pen through it, and said it
could not be true, as the lion. Blank would not,
under any circumstances, expose himself and
others in such a foolish fashion. The pressman
thereupon called on the politician, and told him
that the interview he had had with him on the
previous day would not be credited, and asked
if Ile would give a note certifying to the correct-
ness of the statements made. “Certainly,” was
the reply; “but first read your report of the
interview.” The literary man complied ; the
statesman heard him out, and then said, as he
opened the door, “ You have two minutes to get
clear of this house, and the next time you are sent
to interview anyone, don’t get drunk ; that’s all!”

The “prohibition-order” system is on the
verge of a break-down in Maoriland. According
to law, when a magistrate issues an order setting
forth that John Smith or John J. Jones is not to
be supplied with drink, every publican within a
certain radius has to paste the document con-
spicuously on the wall of his bar. The average
small publican now finds that he can’t comply
with the law much longer because all the walls of
bis bar are full of prohibition orders, and shortly
there will be no space left. Then something will
have to break. Even the most stringent drink
statute can’t make a bar any larger than it is.

In Australia, last year, 10 per cent, of the
buildings struck by lightning were churches.
Considering that churches don’t form one-quarter
per cent, of the buildings in the country, the
inference, according to the parsonical style of
reasoning, is that Providence is 40 times as angry
at churches as it is at public-houses and tote-
shops. Either that, or else the lightning is simply
allowed to strike the tallest building that comes
in its way, in which case the theory of an over-
ruling Providence must be altogether left out, and
then what becomes of the beautiful moral attached
to the story of the bad boy who was drowned
while fishing on Sunday?

Anglican children have had some desperately
comic “self-denial” suggestions offered them re-
cently. For instance, “To ask your clergyman
or Sunday-school teacher to get you a missionary
box, and often to try and get money put into it.’
The average boy invariably turns his little box
upside-down, so as to get money put out of it.
All that comes out is for the collector, and the
residue goes to the pore heathen.

The Melbourne Charity Organisation
Society is going bung. It has used up all

with more oil, this precious machine for grinding
the hopes of the indigent exceeding small will
have to stop working altogether. It has been a
• great boon to the “upper” classes for the last four
or five years. On the strength of his little annual
subscription to the C.O.S. old Buggins, M.L.0.,

distress per annum to the Society’s consideration.
The Good Samaritan just rubbed his hands and
sent the ragged petitioners along to the office in

as impostors or “put in the way of obtaining

found it closed for repairs, and didn’t get any help
at all—well, the Society could help that.

Lunatic Cresswell, of the Parramatta
Asylum, is figuring again as Roger Tichborne.
The fresh “ evidence ” of Cresswell’s identity with
the missing man bristles with suggestions that his
discoverer, fi JVlrs. »Jenkins, is not well read in the
history of the Tichborne trial. By proving a long
intimacy between the crank and Arthur Orton,
who is said to have held possession of his partner’s
“ papers,” the lady merely proves the ab-
surdity of her case. Orton, when he first
put in his claim to the baronetcy, didn t
know the Christian names of old Lady Tich-
borne or anything else which he might have
learned from the “ papers ” aforesaid, and from
Roger himself. Moreover, he had no papers to
s how—and what has become of those valuable
documents, anyhow? The most crushing argu-
ment against the Rarrainatta Roger Ortons
present impecuniosity. If that fallen impostor
had ever been intimate with the man he imper-
sonated, and knew that he was living now, or
might be living, in Australia as Cresswell, he
would have turned the knowledge to account and
come over here to find his old chum long ago.
Orton, when last heard of, was a public-house
potman in very reduced circumstances. /
THE GAMBLER'S TWINS
5 -Ht, (111% ’
The house was hushed. An awful sense
Of something happening.
With mute, mysterious, straining tense.
Tugged hard at everything.
The slippered servants trode the stairs
As spooks in ether float;
Died even then the germs of prayers
In Utterance’s throat.
Yet muffled footfalls seemed to plunge
Along an unseen slope ;
A ghostlike maiden bore a sponge,
Another carried soap.
A worried gambler, reft of rest,
Betrayed no sign insane
Beyond a nose with vigor pressed
Against a window-pane.
A “ Wah !” A “Way !” He turned his head,
Each eye shone like a pebble—
“There were two cries,” he softly said,
“ Contralto and a treble !”
He whistled, “ Whew !” “Great Kokum Epps !
I wonder what’s the trouble?”
He turned his head, he turned his steps,
A halting human bubble.
A man of portly, grave repose
The chamber entered in ;
A man with specs, upon his nose
And folds upon his chin.
His manner was a gracious wheeze,
That added to his sins ;
“They’re all progressing well, and she’s
Presented you with twins !”
A pallor blanched the father’s face,
Fright set his tongue-strings loose :
“ I reckoned that she’d play the Ace,
She’s gone and led the Deuce !”

if you could find a nail to hit in Ausi ralia, 1895... Lost

is both or both neither. Just sort ’em out and label
which that and what t’other, so that people can make
sure of getting the laugh and the groan in at the right

“great” man? The fact that he was Royal physician
does not stamp him as great; and the fact that he did ii t
make Queen Victoria stop drinking whisky stamps him,
from your own view point, as distinctly inferior. As to
Edison, who drinks no alcohol, he is never without a
cigar in his mouth. The basis of the ginger-pop creed is
that man can altogether do without, and be better for
doing without, stimulants and narcotics of all sorts ..
N.A.P. (Kargoolie): The warden’s “favorite attitude of
standing” doesn’t interest this universe..... W.R.W. :
You send printed blocks as original drawings!
A.M.M. (Aramac): Pretty verse, but thin and harmless...
Abates: Thanks, but we have stacks of information about
Coolgardie ; the trouble is that no two informations agree
in any particular.... A. M. (Brisbane): Wild-eyed female
unsuitable Ye Tryer: Ye olde Englyshe doggrele is
not, fitte for publication A.M. (Tenterfield): “ Nellie ”
is mildly pretty but too long, gushful and commonplace.
Also, we have closed down on wattle-poetry... .Semi-
colon: The fact that all the persons in your otherwise
excellent poem are absolutely naked is a drawback.
“ Even The Bulletin ” can only stand a limited amount
of naked figure.... Barnes’s Horse :In short, your philo-
sophy is that when a man is Brown he is really Jones, and

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Her Majesty’s. “The House that Jack
Built."
Lyceum “Cinderella.”

MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess's Theatre “ Beauty and the Beast."

Opera House “ The Double Event.”
A painstaking inspection of “Cinderella,”
at Sydney Lyceum, suggests that the days of
pantomime are over. “ Cinderella ”is more like
a big variety-show than anything else, and it isn’t
even that in a very definite sense. There is a
ballet in it, which can be cordially recommended
as containing as little filmy drapery and as much
inspiriting legs as can well be inserted in the
space ; and a chorus of ladies in bathing-costumes
also deserves warm approval. The “festival of
sport ” is a new idea which appeals to the football
and cricket section of the audience; there is a
graceful procession of bicyclists ; a remarkably
good roller-skate performer, who is by no means
new; an acrobatic person, who is reasonably good,
but not new either; and sundry baby acrobats
who are new, but dismally commonplace. Each
of the latter bows profoundly and takes an
imaginary hair out of his mouth after each feat—
that same old hair which every contortionist
seems to be troubled with in the region of his
digestion. The show also contains two men in
women’s clothes, a baron with a weird story to tell
about his friend Macintyre, and the usual demons,
witches, fairies, and the rest. Mr. Horace
Wheatley, the old man who tells the tale about
Macintyre, is reported to have been specially
engaged in England for the part, and the most
caretul audit of Horace can show no just reason
for his importation. Something more or less to
the same effect may be said about Mr. James
Non ie, who makes “ his first appearance in Aus-
tralia ” as the prince, and reveals himself so far as
a gentleman with nothing in particular in the way
of a singing voice, and no very defined charac-
teristics of any kind.
# * •
The Bulletin had some idea of making
sundry enthusiastic statements concerning Miss
Ray J ones, the “ Cinderella ” of the show, but it
has decided to hang them over till a future oppor-
tunity. Miss Jones is a rather nice little lady,
who sings rather nicely, but she doesn’t lend her-
self to boundless enthusiasm. The security isn’t
good enough. The broad merriment of Martyn
Hagan, as the piincipal man in woman’s clothes,
and Horace Wheatley’s stories about Macintyre,
are the main supports of the pantomime
proper. The Bulletin’s friend Hagan is a
humorist of no mean order, and he sup-
plies nearly all the fun which there is in
“Cinderella.” An altogether commendable trans-
formation-scene helps to redeem the performance,
but, taking itall round, the Lyceum pantomime of
’94 is a rather heavy affair, and its indefinable
aspect of old age is vaguely suggestive of a baby
Chinaman. Saturday night’s audience showed a
painful inclination to take it seriously, and
nothing kills a pantomime faster than being taken
seriously. Also, as Time, in the respected person
of Mr. Hasker, crawled along on two platinum
feet, it developed an inclination to take the show
more and more seriously, and to be taken more
seriously is enough to kill any panto.
This is the rhyme of a pantomime that
was born before due date, like the father’s
boot which lovers compute for ten —and meet at
eight. And on Saturday night Her Majesty’s,
bright with girls in gay frocks and bunions,
seemed somehow to miss the aroma of geese with
a stuffing of sage and onions. Yet all went well
as the marriage belle who has planted six husbands
before, and who walks to the altar without a falter
and audibly asks for more. For indeed the show
has vim and go (because it is meant to stay ?) while
spots are few and three or two of the scenes are
distangay. True, the jokes are weak and nothing
to speak of lurks in the musical setting ; while no
bright star sheds glory afar or takes a strong lead in
the betting. But the company’s even, without any
leaven of norrid, incongruous sticks; and spec-
tacles splendid, until the play’s ended, quench
every desire to heave bricks.
*• ■ •
And in pantos, to see a more charming
idea The Bulletin never hopes, than Jack’s house
a-building by scores of elf-children with scaffolding,
bricks and ropes. So quaint and delightful, so
jolly and spriteful, so artfully guarded from
failure, is the mannikin co., that a better tableau
of its kind is unknown to Australia. Exceed-
ingly good, too, the scene in the wood,
where the witches prove really plump
fairies, in beautiful tights which are full of
delights for the veterans full of vagaries.
The lilliput dance, when the tiny tots prance
through the solemnest, sweetest of measures, is
another joy new, and the two mites in blue are
among the night’s darlingest treasures. The grand
transformation received an ovation, though some
in the. past have excelled it; while the old English
set took one’s fancy, you bet, and the card palace
easily held it.

The best solo was “ ’E dunno,” by a tenor
of half-a-score; but Florrie Forde was a boon
from the Lord when she sang of things done no
more. And then Fred Dark made a visible mark
as he walked out “on his own while the Ber-
mans’ fun was never done till “loyalty” got its
bone. Florrie was Jack, and always came back,
in an architectural spell, to kiss Florence Esdaile,
who made many a breast ail as the Princess Daisy
Bell. And, as for the rest, they gave of their best,
buc space unluckily fails ; so the reader must go
and see the show and fill in his own details.

letin had prepared for these two occasions is,
therefore, held over till next week. Mr. Arnold’s
season opens with “ Charley’s Aunt ” from Brazil,
where the dethroned emperors and the revolu-
tions come from, and the appearance of Mr.
Seagar in Thornton’s old part of the aunt is a
matter of interest. The Kinetoseope, in its old
premises in Pitt-street, is still in good health.

The success of Hosking’s spirits and de-
materialisations —alas ! that Mrs. Besant should
have left without seeing those visions fade-at
Melb. Princess’ last week was slightly damped by
a preliminary lecturer. Nobody appeared to
hanker after any opening remarks, but the inter-
loper in question, whose name was left out of the
bill, held his ground and scoffed at the follies of
spiritualism until the amphitheatre wished him
dead, and signified the same in the usual manner.
He was a dauntless nuisance. As a soldier he
would probably earn the Victoria Cross in his first
engagement with the enemy. “The tricks of
mediums, so-called, cannot deceive us,” said the
lecturer, gazing earnestly at his weary audience,
“we know that our dear ones departed are with
God and of God.” Whereupon a voice from aloft
cried, “ O-o-o-h, God!” And still the gallant
hero stuck to his discourse.

Although “Beauty and the Beast ” was to
be produced at Melb. Princess’ as early as Saturday

more than 5 to 1 against any pantomime being
called “Aladdin”—but no matter. George Dar-
rell, at the Opera House, is doubtless playing
“The Double Event” according to promise,
whilst Elton and a likely company are engaged
in a furious production of “The Judge” at the

Night.

Re spooks. How about these Japanese ones: “In
one of the booths a man stretched on a table, flat
on his back, is alone on the stage ; puppets of almost
human size, with horribly grinning masks, spring out of
his body; they speak, gesticulate, then fall back like
empty rags; with a sudden spring they start up again,
change their costumes, change their faces, tearing about
in one continual frenzy. Suddenly three, even four,
appear at the same time ; they are nothing more than the
four limbs of the outstretched man whose legs and arms,
raised on high, are each one dressed up and capped with
a wig under which peers a mask ; between these phan-
toms tremendous fighting and battling take place, and
many a sword-thrust is exchanged. The most perfect of
all is a certain puppet representing an old hag ; every
lime she appears with her weird head and ghastly grin,
the lights burn low, the music of the accompanying
orchestra moans forth a sinister strain given by the
flutes mingled with a rattling tremolo: which sounds like
the clatter of bones.”—Pierrf. Loti, from “ Madame
Chrymnthbme.”
Madame Heller, while doing the clairvoyant busmessat

thing. I thought he wanted a clergyman, but this he

Sunday afternoon at Vic. Artists’ Society Exhibition,
Melb., is becoming quite popular, and all sorts, frem raw
youths to dressy society fixtures, pace and pose and utter
c dlow criticism. Douglas Richardson’s two adjacent
pictures, “Captives” and the badly-named “Early
S mpathy,” get the most Sunday attention ; they are
both nude studies of barbarians. According to hia “Bush
Idyll ” (a bold localization of the conventional boy piping
to the conventional girl), M’Cubbin doesn’t think
beauty an Australasian characteristic. Ford Paterson’s
“Wattle Blossom ” should have up a notice, “View this
from afar!”—the beastly public gets so close that it
oa .’t see anything but splash. There is much good work
in the exhibition, and more bad—at any rate this is a
Su-'day opinion.
The American stage is in a bad way. Thousands are
“resting.” It is computed that the average salary of

the stars get whopping salaries the rank-and-file are very
poorly paid.

SPORTING
The remarks which an Australian ground crowd j
make are scarcely ever heard in pavilion or members
stand, but the players hear them only too well. When-
ever Gillen started to bowl at Svdney, a volley came from
the fence, “ Keep yourself on, George,” and so on.
Giffen kept himself on, and on, and on, but the
English say his bowling was the best, although Turner
bowled far better than his analysis shows.
* * ♦ ♦
Lockwood takes such an awkwardly long run
that the least miss or slip in his stride will no-ball him.
Thrice in two overs during the test-match Bannerman
called no-ball. In Adelaide, Lockwood bowled 10 no-
balls.
♦ ♦ * *
Jones, the Adelaide fast bowler, cannot reach
the pace of Lockwood or Richardson. He is a good foot-
baller with a footballer’s record ; he has had his nose
broken, his shoulder put out, both knees twisted, one
ankle broken, and the other badly injured. Last season
he was laid up with an injured ankle for seven weeks, and
lost his billet in consequence.
* * 1 ♦ ♦
Darling, the South Australian, is considered by
some of the Englishmen to be a better left-hand batsman
than ever Moses was.
♦ * * •
The full strength of English bowling is in this
team, and, not to boast, the Englishmen wanted it.
Richardson is considered by English critics, and by most
of the present team, to be the best English bowler living.
Lockwood has done feats to make a batsman’s hair up-
end; witness his 5 wickets for 7 in one county-match,
Surrey v. Nottingham; his 11 wickets for 40, all bowled,
Surrey v. Kent. On a sticky wicket he w ill bowl his fastest
and make nearly every ball break back a foot. His first
app' arance against an Australian Eleven was with
Nottingham in ’B6 ; his first ball bowled Bonnor. “She
was a fast one; she squatted on the pitch and shot in
low.” So Lockwood describes it. Peel is proverbial for
consistency, and Briggs is Grace’s pet bowler.
’*♦ » *
The English, in the test match, had bad luck
with their bowlers. The first Australian innings saw the
collapse of Lockwood ; he showed typhoidal symptoms for
two days, but by Monday was well again. Next, Richard-
son, after bowling Lyons at the 'start of the second
innings, gave up, his brain spinning ; he came back to the
dressing-room with a temperature of 102.
* ♦ ♦ •
To be bowled off the pads each innings of the
test-match was a tame death for the great Lyons. He
went in first, as usual, with Trott, in the second innings ;
he never felt better; he hit with might and main; he
broke a bat; he got another; he made 25 while Trott
made 1; then the pads which were meant to defend him
betrayed him to the enemy. Phillips, the English
umpire, smiled as the giant came back from the wjeket.
Was he thinking of the day when he met Lyons in thj
match Australia v. Middlesex, at Kennington Oval, and
sent the great smiter a tempting one to lure him to
destruction ? Lyons accepted the temptation, and
nearly killed a cab-horse by driving the ball clean out of
the ground, over the pavilion.
After five days’ play, and after 1400 runs had
been scored upon it, the Sydney wicket was easy and
true ; its durability was a revelation to those of the Eng-
lish who had never visited Australia before. “ Seeing is
believing,” said Lockwood. “I’d have thought it im-
possible for a wicket to stand like this; fine weather
makes fine wickets, and fine wickets make fine batsmen ;
we bat better here than we do in England.”

Ford looked safe for a century when he made a
false stroke and was caught out for 48. He is highly-
strung and sanguine ; he returned to the dressing-room
with the keenest air of disappointment. He comes of a
numerous family—has ten brothers.
* * * *
The ball travels over the English fielding-ground
much faster than it does over the Australian. When the
Englishmen played Adelaide, the grass in the out-field
was 2in. long and greatly retarded the ball.
« * * *
Stoddart anxiously watched the close of the
second English innings in the Sydney test-match, clap-
ping his men vigorously at every good stroke, and
expressing his gratification because “we have made a
fight of it.” But his face beamed on Thursday morning,
after the rain had “ made a night of it.”

Junior cricketers bitterly complain of the 2s. fid.
per man for both elevens charged by Sydney Cricket
Ground trustees for match-wickets. The Domain charge
is only 9d. per man of one team, and 3d. of this is really a
special bonus to the caretaker.
* * ♦ *
Humphreys, the English lob bowler, has played
county cricket the last 23 years, and as the last English
season was exceptionally dry, he then excelled his previous
county records by capturing 122 wickets. Although he
likes fast wickets, the Adelaide wicket did not suit his
bowling; its peculiar “ glassiness ” takes all the devil out
of his ball. In his quarter of a century’s cricket, he played
for the first time on matting, when his deceitful lobs,
breaking well on the dark-blue pitch, bamboozled the
batsmen of Armidale: in that match he came out with
the fine analysis of 9 wickets at 5 runs per wicket. On a
sticky wicket—that is, a Turner wicket—he can break a
good-length, good-pace ball one yard. This visit, his first
to Australia, will probably close his long career as a
cricketer.
* * * *
Dear Bulletin, — After reading much cricket-
literature, and listening to many' animatrd discussions
outside newspaper offices, I have discovered that Stod-
dart’s team can’t play with the worst of the luck, any-
how'. The Australians win the toss, and Lockwood, an
important item in the game, is prevented by a strain from
helping to get them out. The Australians made a big
score, which is solely accounted for by “magnificent bat-
ting.” Then the English go in and a lot of rain falls
during their innings, yet there is no bad luck about that.
The wicket “favors the bowlers a little,” but not much.
The proof lies in the fact that Stoddart and Co. are not
wiped out immediately—there is i o suggestion of fine bat-
ting in their case. Then the Englishmen have the good luck
to follow on (being 260 runs behind) upon a wicket which
“ rolls out almost as good as at the start,” when, by the
way, the other side had the use of it. And Blackham
hurts his hand—a splendid piece of luck for the English-
men ! The loss of the toss, the loss of a valuable bowler,
the spoiled wicket for their first innings—all these matters
were as nothing compared with the other side’s cruel
luck in losing Blackham. And, finally, the Australians’
horrible ill-fortune reached its climax in the second
innings, when 8 wickets fell for 53. The bowling and
fielding, of course, had a little to do with it ; but it was
the rain that did the real mischief. If three of the
Englishmen were to die during the match, the circum-
stance, “although decidedly unfortunate for the visitors,”
would “ in no wise detract from the merit of the Austra-
lian victory”—which, as it happens, is a defeat thanks to
“the visitation of God."’Yours, Britisher.
« * ♦ ♦
Comparisons between the match of last week
and the game played at the Oval in 1882 are quite absurd.
The seven runs by which the Australians beat England
represented about 2£ per cent, of the total number of
runs scored by both sides in one day. Stoddart’s team
won by § per cent, of the grand total scored in five days
and a bit. Enthusiasts may point to the figures
on the board, as Marc Antony pointed to the dead
figure of J. Caesar, and cry, “ Here was a cricket-match 1
When comes such another ? ”
When telegrams were posted in Melbourne on
the Monday, announcing “ Heavy rain ” and a temporary
suspension of play in the grt at match, several rash book-
makers set about “making a hit” by laying hundreds or
fifties to one on the Australians. The writer knows of
one young Hebrew who took £2OO to £3 10s. from another
Chosen Person.
Had the Englishmen gone in first and the posi-
tions of the teams been reversed—imagine the headlines
in the newspapers! “An Unparalleled Yietoiy. A Great
Game Gloriously Won. Wonderful Bowling by (say)
Giffen and Turner. Advance Australia!” As it turned
out, the headlines were modest in size, and most
ingeniously worded. The two Melbourne dailies an-
nounced respectively—“ Unexpected Defeat of the Aus-
tralians,” and “Victory snatched from the Australians.”
The English bowling got ne’er a mention at the top of
the column. After the score had reached 158 (with five
wickets to fall) Peel put up a record of 4 wickets, and two
easy chances missed off him, for 5 runs.
♦ * * *
“Johnny” Briggs, the best of the English
fields, brought his father 100 miles to see Gregory field
for the Australians in England. Briggs pater watched
Gregory most intently, and his verdict was, “I don't
think him better than you, Johnny 1” “ But he can throw
in better, father?” “ Well, it’s doubtful, Johnny.”
♦ * * *
Smokers and drinkers poll well in the teams
of the last big test cricket-match. Of the Englishmen,
amateur Ford is the sole non-smoker and teetotaller, but
Humphreys smokes rarely. All the Australians smoke,
and their one teetotaller is Darling, of Adelaide.
* * * *
Graham fielded splendidly in the test-match,
until Briggs hit a ball so fair into his hands that he had
not to budge an inch for it; he dropped it, and was almost
too crestfallen to look up again. Brown, the best outfield
on the English side, made the mistake of a novice in the
Adelaide match : misjudging the flight of a ball, he let it
drop a yard in front of him.
r » ♦ ♦ •
The perfect innings of the present tour, in the
Englishmen’s opinion, was played in the Melbourne
match by Trott for 62.

All through the test-match the English played to
win. On the Sunday, looking at the Australians’ score of
586, they said, “We have not a 100 to 1 chancebut

they also said, “Wait, cricket is cricket.’’ They made
325 in their first innings, leaving them 261 in arrears ;
nevertheless, they were all fight. M’Laren took a wager
of £2OO to £l4 against them, and Stoddart bet a level £2O
that his men would conquer. They were going to score
600 in their second innings. They reached 437 ; Gay being
the only one not able to obtain double figures.
The Australians only wanted 176 to win ;
Gregory had scored 201 himself in the first innings,
breaking the hearts of the English bowlers and earning
nearly £5OO in money laid him in hundreds and fifties to
nothing, for one Australian bookmaker stood to lose, and
did lose, many thousands by an English victory. As
the English lost Lockwood through illness for the first
Australian innings, so now they lost Richardson for the
second, and Richardson was the only bowler who had suc-
ceeded in puzzling Gregory, Giffen and Iredale. At 4
o’clock on the Wednesday, as a threatening bank of clouds
rose up in the south-east, Lyons came out with Trott,
and scoring 25 in 14 minutes, while Trott scored one,
showed how the match was to be won. But Lyons got
out then, and Giffen and Trott played maiden after maiden
to the English bowlers, who were cheered by the near
prospect of a downpour. There was that in the air which
said: “The cricketer proposes, but the weather dis-
poses.”
The Australian team, watching in the stand and
feeling the weather-influence, chafed at the tardiness of
the game. Gregory and Iredale said: “If we don’t get
130 to-night we shall be beaten on the wet wicket to-
morrow.” If Giffen had sent in Gregory and Iredale
instead of Trott and himself, the match, already virtually
won, would probably have been ended that evening. But
instead of the needed 130 the Australians scored 113 by
the day’s close, and on the morrow Peel and Briggs,
playing havoc on the sodden wicket, wrenched victory
from the very grasp of the Australian team, and the
English, who deserved to win, triumphed by 10 runs.

Stoddart denies absolutely the statements pub-
lished that he, at Armidale, N.S.W., thought that no
more than eleven men should be in the field in any match.
* « * »
Stoddart is most emphatic re interviewing : “ I
would have no pleasure in the tour at all if I were to be
interviewed. Any reports that have been published as
being interviews with me are absolutely untrue, lor I
have never given an opinion to a newspaper man on the
tour, at any of the towns I have visited. I hope you will,
therefore, excuse me in declining to say anything about
the match.” Now, the Adelaide papers printed “inter-
views ” and wired them to the other provinces.

Pall Mall Gazette, which used to pirate the
Times cables wholesale, has adopted very different tactics
under the rbgimß of millionaire Astor, who, during the
cricket match Australia v. England, had a special cable
of 2000 words a day (at Is. 9d. per word), sent from Sydney
at different stages of the game.

George Gi Sen’s 161 against England prompted a
testimonial-fund in Adelaide, but it failed to boom, for
various reasons. By changing his club this year, he lost
all bis old Norwood supporters, especially the influential
and wealthy E. T. Smith, whose £lO 10s. is absent from
the list, Giffen has been sinned against as much as sin-
ning, thiugh.

The mammoth score of 536, first innings of the
Australians v. Stoddart’s, is the record for a test-match,
*he previous record being 551 made by Murdoch’s 1884
team at the Oval, Surrey. In this match three men
reached the century, viz., Murdoch 211, Scott 102, and P.
M ‘Donnell 103.

Some unspeakable ass cables from England to
lay that: “According to the Loudon Daily Chronicle, in
the recent test cricket-match the batting and bowling of
the Englishmen were, probably, superior to the Aus-
tralians, but in fielding the visitors were not equal to the
colonials. The London Daily News and Standard con-
sider that the first test cricket-match in Sydney was with-
out parallel in the history of similar contests.” The Aus-
tralian, apparently, hasn’t a definite opinion about an event
which he saw with his own eyes, until some unknown Eng-
lishman, who didn’t see it, supplies him with one from
16,000 miles away.
* * * •
The whole-souled Australian view of the test-
match is that “ our boys ” collapsed through wet rot.
The opposition view is that the awful fall at least partially
resulted from dry rot.

Four of the Australian team are Post-office
employes: Giffen aid Raedman in Adelaide; Trott in
Melbourne ; Gregory in Sydney.

Trumper, the boy who made 67 in slashing style
for the 18 N.S.W. Juniors against the Englishmen, was 17
on 2nd Nov. last, and is a pupil-teacher at Crown-street
(Sydney) Public-school. It is a pity, by the way, that 18
Juniors were played against St.oddart’s team. The Eng-
lishmen mighthave routed a juniorllwith great slaughter,
but, at any rate, they would have been more on their
mettle against an 11. In an 11 versus 18 match neither
side can possibly get any glory. After their first day’s
batting the Juniors should have declared their innings
closed, and (if possible) fielded only 11 men against the
visitors.

Dear Bulletin, —My ascetic soul deviseth every
week new tortures for my sins. The Austral cycle became
the wheel of Ixion for me last week, “ high in the dome,
suspended, of hell,” as Browning hath it. This week a
regatta on the Yarra furnished forth my banquet of
torment. Half-naked men, shocking examples of city
physique, flitted hither and thither in crab-traps on the
river's brown bosom. Every now and again at the pop of
a pistol various nakednesses in crab-traps would shrill out
unmusical cheers, and go their way. Then I and the
othej wretches on the hanks would wonder if something
might happen soon. But nathing happened, except that
the evening paper spread an account of it over a weary
column. —Yours, respectfully, Y.Z.
The New Year’s Day meeting of the Y.R.O.
ought to show a profit this time. The stakes have been
lavishly decreased without affecting the number of
probable starters, and a January Ist attendance at Flem-
ington is always fairly satisfactory. But the Standish
and Bagot “ double ” has lost all its old interest for
punters now that there are not more than three certain
“ goers ” for any little handicap until the horses leave
the paddock. The Bagot used to be a £lOOO event.

The Vic. Govt, is being urged to take proceed-
ings against the alleged Hollis-gun forgers. A queer
thing is the law, as administered. If you forge a cheque
for £1 a prosecution will automatically follow and you
will get three years, if not seven ; if you forge the maker’s
name on a gun you won’t be prosecuted unless somebody
forcibly reminds the Government that the deed is not one
to be quite squared by civil process.

Walter Griffiths, M.P., the baby of the S.A.
Assembly, made 109 runs, not out, in the cricket-match,
Parliament v. Press, early in December. He just equalled
the scribblers’ entire score off his own bat.

Vicissitudes of the turf: A one-time owner of
one of the greatest horses that ever won a Vic. Derby
was up on a so-called “fraud’’-summons, the other day, for
a £3 debt, at a suburban court. Yet the same decent fellow
could have given the game up with £20,000 had he been
sensible. He intended to do so. He ventured one more
shot, and backed his horses to win a double of about
thirty “ thou.,” and lost. Tried again, and lost. Ditto 1

Middleton, the Dunolly miner, who won this
year’s Austral Wheel Race, is slobbered over in print as a
“ magnificent specimen of young Australia.” As a matter
of fact, whatever Middleton may be as a cyclist, he is
certainly no Apollo: tall, thin, and cadaverous his looks
certainly belie the list. 81b. he claims to weigh.

Thurgood, the Vio. champion goal-kicker, ap-
peared at the A. A. sports in Melb. last week, and won
putting the weight (161 b.) without an effort. Thurgood is
so splendidly-built that he should be about the first man
selected by Williamson and Musgrove for their male
living pictures.
The M. 8.0. takes something over J6lOOO out of
its two days’ Austral meeting. Surely it would pay
some enterprising individual to promote a similar one on
Sydney Association Ground. The stake of £2oo—which
looks so enormous to the naked eye—is nearly met by the
entrance and acceptance-fees of the competitors. This
year 94 cyclists each paid £2 fees.

Punters are at last afforded a chance of getting
at the cause of a certain Maoriland horse’s “in-and-out”
running. He is awarded fourteen stone in a certain event,
to allow, no doubt, of his carrying the stable jockey as
well as a representative of the punting fraternity, who
will offer suggestions to the jock during the race, and see
that the jock rides him properly. A similar system
applied to a few inconsistent bookmakers' horses would
be most gratifying to backers generally.

Jenkins, the crack cyclist, will go for the five-
mile championship of the Crusaders Club at North Shore,
Sydney, on Deo. 15. and that will be his last race. Like
Hanlan, he thinks the athletes’ reign is only for 10 years.
He has been in training 18 years, and has raced against
men and time, all distances from J mile to 100 miles. He
has 79 prizes, of which first-prizes number no less than 57.
In 'B3 he put up the N.S. W. 100-mile record and in ’BB he
eclipsed himself by winning 17 first-prizes.

Iredale has been a N.S.W. cricket representa-
tive since ’B7, when he scored 53 and 0 against Victoria.
Bad luck has befallen him as it does all other men and
cricketers ; one interprovincial season his average fell to
7 runs an innings, but still worse luck awaited him, for,
after earning a place by splendid batting in the ’92 Aus-
tralian eleven, his merits were passed over by the selec-
tion committee. Against English elevens and the teams
of Melbourne and Adelaide he has, during the past seven
seasons, scored over 1000 runs—average, 33 per innings.

The use of cocoanut matting for cricketing
pitches is a purely Australian idea, and came as a revela-
tion to the English Eleven of ’BB. O’Brien held that its
use would add two months to the English cricket season,
and prophesied that by ’B9 every club in the United
Kingdom would be using it. Has this prediction come offy

Mr. Lloyd Burdekin, medical student,

tressing event are not clear.
The S.A. Govt, is liable for a further sum
of <£1,484,330 payable to squatters for improve-
ments on their leases. The intent of the present
Pastoral Bill is to induce run-holders to accept
longer tenure and other advantages in satisfaction
of the claims now accruing. “Remember,” says
Jenkin Coles, “ if the squatters accept the alterna-
tive it will only be because the State is getting the
worst of the bargain ! ” Which doesn’t follow.
Lots of bargains profit both parties.
The claim that the lunatic William Cres-
well is identical with the long-lost Roger Tich-
borne, is much discounted by the allegation of
Mrs. Jenkins, his “discoverer,” that she was
“impelled by a voice from the dead.” Spooks
are at a discount just now. And what matters it
intrinsically whether or not Creswell is Tichborne ?
Creswell is childless, and being a lunatic he can’t
make a will, and when he dies young Tichborne,
the present Bart., would succeed him.
In all English-manufactured maps of Aus-
tralia there appears a large circular blot of ink on
the Goulburn river, about 20 miles below Seymour,
denominated “ Mitchellstown,” which the average
Britisher sizes up as a town of equal
importance with Ballarat or Bendigo. The site
of this township was marked by Major Mitchell
in 1840 or thereabouts, but since then nothing
more has been heard about it. The map-draughts-
man, however, goes on making Hingland “Re-
member Mitchellstown” by dumping a yearly
increasing blot to indicate its position. It is now
really about time for some enterprising deacon to
go ’Ome and trade off a few magnificent Mitchells-
town city blocks on the British investor.
The White Horse Cellar Whisky is a
brand which has stood the test of more than 150
years and is still in as good repair as ever. The
world has progressed a lot in a century and a
half, but the art of whisky-making has evidently
stood still, for the White Horse Cellar brand is
still blended according to the same old recipe, and
no brand of later date can excel it. Evidently the
things that our drinky forefathers didn’t know
about whisky were not worth knowing. Langdon
and Co., of Melbourne and Clarence-street,
Sydney, and Harrold Bros, of Adelaide, are
wholesale agents for this venerable liquor, whose
age alone should commend it to the political and
other fossils of the land.
A few years ago, while searching the
archives of the Church of Sainte Croix of Bor-
deaux for the purpose of studying the old MSS.
relating to the history of the venerable abbey of
Sonlao, which had been built for a number of
centuries, a lucky chance led to the discovery of a
very old prescription of dentifrice, composed by
the Rev. Father Pierre Boursaud, Prior of the
monastery about the end of the 14th century.
It was found that the Rev. Father had bequeathed
to posterity an elixir of which the virtues are
simply marvellous ; and the most brilliant proofs
have shown that the preservation of the teeth is
not the only virtue that this precious specific
enjoys, but that its effects are most beneficial in
all that relates to the hygiene of the mouth. This
incomparable elixir prevents decay, and acts like a
tonic on the gums, which it hardens and hinders
from swelling, at the same time purifying and
sweetening the breath, leaving in the mouth a
delicious and lasting freshness, while it con-
tinuously opposes sore throat, hoarseness, ulcera-
tions, and inflammation of all kinds. In one
word, the daily use of the Elixir-Dentrifice of the
Reverend Benedictine Fathers of the Abbey of
Soulac assures the health of the mouth and
throat; and in preserving the teeth even of per-
sons of advanced age, renders easy the work of
the digestive organs by permitting thorough
mastication.
Sydney Wool Sales.
M‘Burney, Wallis & Co. report.—On the 18th instant
we placed before buyers a catalogue of some 2000 bales
wool, representing all the districts from which wool is
now arriving in Sydney. For free and light merino fleece
we found competition very strong, prices ruling up to late
rates. Crossbred is still receding in price, and, as we
wrote in our last Annual, the “ fad” for this class of wool
seems to be fast dying out. Scoured wool is still very
difficult to quit at reasonable prices. Greasy pieces and
bellies are still from lid. to 2d. per lb. lower than last
season. As buyers claim the privilege of a Christmas rest,
no sales will be held before January. On the 10th of that
month we will submit to purchasers another large and
attractive catalogue. We hope the new year may have
better times in store for the wool producers of Australia
and for trade in general. Sydney, December 21.

The Caligraph Writ tin Machine.
B
UAJMCKAPH embodies all the highest
i developments of applied mechanics, and its
principle having stood the test of 15 years, its
success towers above the fantastic devices of mush-
room competitors.
“ I like Caligraph writing better than that of
any other typewriter because the type comes out
so sharply and clearly.” The prominent Anglican
clergyman, who used these words, had hit upon
the chief characteristic of the Caligraph without
exactly knowing what brought it about. Tin-
result is attributable to the fact that the platen of
the Caligraph being bevelled the type strike
against a flat surface thus producing a full and
even impression. When you see typewriting with
only the middle of the letters clear you know that
the machine used was not a Caligraph, but om-
fitted witli the ordinary round platen. When you
read a typewritten letter, with some of the type
leaning to the right and the rest to the left, you
may be sure that your correspondent has a crude
machine, with curved typebars, which naturally
become more crooked, and thus twist their typ--
out of perpendicular. Then remember that the
Caligraph has straight typebars which, like every
thing else in the machine, are fitted with adjust-
able bearings.
The Caligraph manifolds 15 carbon copies at
one operation, and used with the Edison Mimeo-
graph reduplicates 1500 copies from one stencil.

All the big Melb. newspapers are about to

ticularly rough on the Melbi comps., as the closing-
up of the Standard ’ recently, and Melb. Daily

with surplus hands. The youth who is learning
to be a compositor nowadays might almost as well
be apprenticed to a crusader. He is learning a

he is ready to make his living by it.
The deaths in Maoriland from cancer aver-
aged 5.02 per 10,000 living persons in ’93 ; in ’Bl, the
number per 10,000 was only 2.69 ! A West Coast
(South Island) stock-inspector triumphantly points
out that cancer has vanished from his district as a
result of his persistent destruction of every beast
showing the slightest trace of the disease. This
contrasts with a startling report from the Jeypore
hospital (Bengal, India), and one that has been a
hard nut for vegetarians to crack. Out of 102
major operations for cancer performed in the
Jeypore hospital, 61 were performed on strict
vegetarians, and only 41 on meat-eaters. Not-
withstanding which, Maoriland will be wise if it
acts upon its own experience. By the way, a N.S.
Wales J.P., remarkable for his execration of the
barmaid-system, seems to distinguish sharply
between moral and physical pests. He was fined
the other day for auctioning a. cancered bullock.
Dr. A. W. Momerie, the Broad Church
Christian and ex-Professor of Logic at London
University, now,on a visit to Australia, is a fine
example of “As the twig’s bent, the tree’s in-
clined/’ His criticism of ecclesiastical dogma is
singularly clear-headed and destructive. He is
the author of many crisp sentences like these :
The priests were the gentlemen who undertook to
square the a consideration.
The orthodox man prostitutes his conscience to save
his soul.
Morality without a God is infinitely better than a God
without morality. _
He says the Bible is not infallible; the doc-
trine of the atonement is grossly immoral;
the doctrines of the trinity and the resur-
rection are ridiculous. He declares that “what
usually passes current in the present day
under the name of Christianity is a compound
of pre-Christian paganism, post-Christian meta-
physics, and a little—a very little—of the actual
teachings of Christ Himself.” Yet he is still a
clergyman of the Established Church of England !
His early bias was towards the Church; and a fine
capacity for casuistry has enabled him hitherto, by
reconciling opposites, to evade complete intellectual
emancipation. “ Logic is logic,” as Dr. Holmes
remarked.

A few days ago the cable announced that
the usual Anarchist bomb, with fuse attached, had
been discovered in London, and extinguished by a
gallant policeman just in time to avert the most
awful consequences. Next day the usual explana-
tion came along announcing that there was no
explosive in the “ bomb.” As a bomb consists of
any hollow, metallic substance capable of holding
anything that will explode, the chances are that
this one was a meat-tin or a saucepan. As for the
fuse, it was probably an effort of the policeman’s
imagination, or a lucifer match, or the reflection
bf a street lamp.
Lika-Joko Furniss is a nephew of the
Well-known Father Furniss, who wrote that blood-
curdling little book, “Hell open to Christians,”
which forms part of the pabulum offered to
juvenile R.C.’s, Furniss, by the way, has some-
how made himself much disliked by his press
Confreres, and there are not many lamentations to
be heard oveir the failure of his “comic” paper,
named after himself. Perhaps “failure” is too
strong a word, but a well-known man says “ it is
even worse than he hoped it would be.” The fact
is that when Furniss was ejected to the Garrick
he got too big for his boots, and rather cold-
shouldered some old friends.
A Sydney paper is reprinting the “spook’
expose by Dr. Knaggs, the well-known Sydney sur-
geon, of spiritualist Slade’s tricks as performed in
Sydney and Melbourne years ago. The doctor
unravelled the alleged mysteries of table-rapping,
slate writing and ambulatory chairs and tables, by
the agency of a strip of looking-glass between his
knees. Slade, by the way, told a Melbourne
journalist that he knew it was all up with him
when Knaggs came a second time to the seance.
Slade, at the time, was visiting Hyslop, the well-
known Melbourne bedding-manufacturer and
financier, with Junor-Brown (Alfred Deakin’s
father-indaw), of the old Melbourne spiritualistic
Lyceum gang. Hyslop, though one of the cult,
was one of the keenest and shrewdest business men
that ever resided in Melbourne. He followed Dr.
Knaggs’ method and completely demonstrated in
like manner that the only “spirit” brought to
bear by Slade was his extraordinarily flexible foot
which, encased in patent-leather shoes of glove-
like tenuity, enabled him to dispense with the use
of his hands in the evolution of his “ phenomena.”
But did this convert Hyslop ? Not a bit of it. It
didn’t even slacken him off Slade. His explana-
tion was that Slade, to provide against occasional
collapses of “dccult” power, had to resort to
physical ggency iq critical moments. No one can
remember how often spiritualism has been busted
up and exposed and utterly discredited, yet it
always starts again as fresh as ever.

SWORN TESTIMONY. STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, THOS. MUDIM AN, Master Tailor, of 547 George-streefc, Sydney, in the Colony of
New South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows .
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which
affected me so mucli that I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried Several doctors
and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr
Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “ Alp aline
Vitality Pills,” which I hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare Completely Cured Me with-
in a few weeks, and although this is over five
years ago I have remained well ever since.
The Alfaline Pills also cured my wife, and
I make this solemn declaration conscientiously
believing the same to be true.

To Herr Rassmussen.

acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and, in consequence, I have recommended them
to many friends, who have all been cured by
their use. —Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.

you that a course of your Alfaline Pitts Com-
pletely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention
that several of my friends to whom I have
recommended your remedies have derived great
benefit from them; therefore, I consider you

heartily wish you.—Yours gratefully,

Herr Rassmussen. I 1 'March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having
been a sufferer from ’General Debility of the

of the Alfaline Remedies I am now completely
cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I
was. Thanking you for your courtesy and

LIVERPOOL & LONDON & GLOBE
Total A ssets — INSURANCE COMPANY.
For years past sensationalism has been rampant in the fire insurance world ; and to find that a Company which
has steadily declined to d viate from the quiet far-seeing and self-respecting policy which has given .the Liverpool and
London aiid Globe its proud position, which has refused to be tempted into any lurid display of financial fireworks,
continues to so easily outdistance all its competitors, is a special pleasure and gratification to those'who wish to pre-
vent fire insurance from degenerating into a mad scramble for other people’s loaves and fishes, and \vho desire to see
the dignity of the profession worthily upheld. . . ..
The fire department for the past year shows an increase of premium income of over £43,000, and a trading account
su plus of £70,954, or about 4J per cent, of the premiums. The figures for three years will serve by way of com-

The other day the orthodox Anglicans of
Australia, by episcopal request, exercised “ self-
denial ” in order to aid the funds for foreign
missions. Putting the scheme in other words,
the heathen in Australia suffered, by “self-
denial,” for the benefit of heathen elsewhere
and of the travellers who live by them.
The Victorian Trades Defence Association,
it is reported, “assures Mr. Turner that a re-
duction in the import duties on spirits, wine and
beer would materially increase both the revenue
and the consumption.” In other words, it will
make the people so much more drunken than they
are, and will send so much more money out of the
country in payment for imported blue-ruin, that
the reduction in the duty will be more than com-
pensated for. Query : If it is proposed to
deliberately make the community drunk in order
to secure revenue, why not licence opium-dens,
lotteries, gambling-houses and houses of ill-fame,
and go in generally for making a revenue out of
sin in all its available forms ?
“ There is an ‘ unearned increment ’ when
the stock of some particular horse wins the Cup
and Derby—all other colts and fillies springing
from the same sire increase in value,” says Melb.
Aequs by way of demonstrating that unearned
increment in land values should not be annexed
by the State. The comparison is asinine. In the
case of the horse the increment is earned by the
animal himself, and the increase in the price of
his stock, if it occurs, is occasioned, not by his
winning the race, but because his success give-
proof that he has good material in him, and comes
of a good stock. When a piece of land in Collins-
street wins the Melbourne Cup the Argus’ horse
argument will begin to be reasonable.

“ It is lighter, clearer and more ethereal oil than

Ycu of the Past, are you present?
Draw nearer, my heart is sore.
Was yours the fall of the foot in the hall ?
Was yours the face at the door?
As I lifted ray eyes I saw you ;
, You vanished and all was still;
And only outside the white owl cried,
And the moon stared over the hill.
Wan-blue were your eyes, O Shadow,
And paler your aspect than seems
The mystical star that glimmers afar
In a land of mysterious dreams.
O, Shadow, the past is present,
And empty your coffin and tomb;
Draw near, draw near, chill child of fear,
; From the frontier-land of Gloom.
When you were a girl, grey Shadow,
And life in these veins ran red,
My heart went out to your golden mouth
And the curls about your head.
Did you know that I loved you, Shadow?
Did you guess whence the violets came?
And the delicate heart with its Cupid dart,
All opal and ruby-flame ?
Those days, brown gold were the lashes
That shadowed your dreaming eyes,
4-nd your teeth were pearl ’neath the coral curl
Of twin portals of Paradise.
And redder your cheeks were and softer
(Alas, they are pale and cold !)
Than the rose of the East, or the wine that the
priest
Drinks out of his carven gold.
It was all so sad, O Shadow,
And you faded away so soon,
Like a note that flies and fades and dies
Ere it grows to a golden tune.
Gone ! utterly gone, O Shadow,
No whisper, no word let fall;
No light is shed, and the moon is dead,
And a chill creeps up the wall.
I shall follow and follow you, Shadow,
Till the sun, .remote and red,
Burns like a spark, and dim and dark
Rise up the hosts of dead.
RODERIC QUINN.
Philosophy has never given a good reason
why a man, who, at 25, is willing to share with
the world, at 55, will shoot down the first who
wants to borrow a match from him.
Several N.S.W. public - school teachers
have of late been approached with offers of liberal
remuneration if they will incorporate in the home
exercises of their pupils favourable comments on
certain brands of newly - introduced domestic
necessaries. In one case the agent of a firm
agreed to pay cash down on examining the exercise
books at the end of each month. The great art of
advertising again.
The Westraliau bonanza-men are decorat-
ing themselves in the East. One Londonderry
potentate has bought “ the biggest (yellow)
diamond in Sydney ” for .£llO, and when he
showed it to a mate, in presence of a friend, the
mate said : “ I’ve got one, too ” indicating a large
wart on the middle joint of his little finger—“the
garotters can have that if they like.” And con-
cerning the bejewelled glory of a Wealth of
Nations magnate—you should just see him when
he’s got ’em all on.
The sapient S.M. Herald gravely records
how R. E. O’Connor was introduced to Sir Oliver
Morton (presumably Mowat), Premier of Toronto
(Ontario). Which is the same as if a Toronto paper
had remarked that Mackenzie Bowell was intro-
duced to “Mr. George Re Ige, Premier of Sydney.”
Next day’s Sydney Telegraph repeated the
blunder. Yet the Sydney papers are never tired
of commenting on the ignorance of Australian
localities displayed by foreign critics. But it will
be a cold day when the physician heals himself.
Municipal grovel, even in London, has no
ancient precedents to justify its modern awfulness.
A century ago the Lord Mayor disputed the
Pripee of Wales’claim to rank before him within
the city bounds, and the King decided in favor of
the angry soap-boiler, otherwise the soap-boiler
would have made things darned unpleasant for
His Majesty. Nowadays, the chief business of a
Lord Mayor is to lick Albert Edward’s boots on
behalf of the “loyal citizens,” and wink at an all-
round maladministration of charity trusts and
guild moneys.

DO THOU LIKEWISE.
When one sets a candle in a window on a dark
night he never can tell how many lost and be-
wildered travellers it may guide on their way.
I once knew a dear lady who habitually did it
on every dark night. The road that passed her
house was always forsaken and lonesome enough,
and houses were far apart. So, on the general
principle of goodwill to men, she placed her
candle in a sort of projecting window, where it
would shine both ways and do the most good.
She is dead and gone now, but let us hope that
her family keeps up the custom. To be sure, it
brought her many a strange guest, yet she did
what she could for them, and never grumbled—
pay or no pay.
A year or two ago a little book was printed,
containing an account, by Mr. John Hodson, of
Warboys, Hunts, of the way he was cured of a
wasting disease by Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup—-a complaint contracted in India, where
Mr. Hodson was once a soldier in the British
Army.
This candle of Hodson’s beamed hopefully in
all directions, and, among others, its rays fell
upon the eyes of a woman who needed light at
that particular time. How it came to pass she
tells in a letter, from which we quote the follow-
ing:—
“I was,” she says, “always healthy up to
May, 1884, when I nad an attack of gastric
fever, which left me low and feeble. I had a
bad taste in the mouth, and after everything I
ate I had great pain in the chest and sides, and
also dreadful pam at the back and between the
shoulder-blades, and a sinking feeling at the pit
of the stomach. My legs trembled and shook
under me, so I could not walk out. Indeed, it
was as much as I could do to get across the
floor. A dry, hacking cough set in and shook
me very much, and I lost a deal of sleep.
“As I grew weaker I was confined to my bed
more and more, and my daughter was obliged to
take my place in doing the housework. A doctor
attended me for over a year. He tried first one
kind of medicine and then another, but none of
them helped me. At the end of the year the
doctor said he could do no more for me, and
recommended me, as a last resort, to try a change
of air.
“I had got a despair of ever getting better
when a book was sent to me full of statements
from different people, telling how they had been
made well of various complaints by using Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup, and I read of a young
man living at Warboys, near me, having been
cured in a marvellous manner by this medicine.
I got a bottle from Messrs. Palmer and Sons,
chemists, Ramsey, and, after I had taken it a
week, I felt relief and gained strength. All my
vain left me, and I have never looked behind me
since. I take an occasional dose of the Syrup
and keep in excellent health. I give you full
permission to use this letter as you think fit.
Yours truly, (signed) Sarah Mason, Ramsey
Heights, Ramsey, Hunts, January 27th, 1892.”
What better use could we possibly put this
lady’s letter to than to publish it ? In this way
it has fallen into the present reader’s hands, and
may turn out to be a candle in the window to
show him refuge and shelter beside some long and
floomy path. A word more on this very point,
t is not a matter of choice whether we are to
help one another. We are obliged and bound to do
so by every consideration of morality and utility.
Humanity is like the body of one man : if a single
part is neglected, the rest must pay the penalty.
Therefore, set candles in windows. If, for
instance, Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup has
done you good, say so, publish it, make it known.
Others near you may be groping in darkness.
And it is afl the more a subject of rejoicing that
this remedy, as in the above case, conquers indi-
gestion and dyspepsia, because that complaint it
is which clouds the aim for millions on Life’s
hard road.

A Queensland station has a lovely liar.
He lately entered an up-country store and asked
for strychnine. “ Dingoes thick! ’’ he said.
“ Why, I woke up t’other night and looked out
and 1 saw ’em just like a mob o’ sheep. I’ll
take half-an-ounce of the stuff to make ’em sit
up.” Now, that storekeeper was out of strychnine,
but rather than lose his customer he substituted
Epsom salts. A week later the purchaser re-
turned. “ Well, how did you get on with the
dingoes?” enquired the storekeeper. “Found 28
of them dead next morning. Haven’t seen one
since.’’
A statement of the service of Col. Charles
Holled Smith, the new Yic. Commandant :
Joined British Army in ’65; served in Zulu and
Boer Wars, ’79 to ’81; Egypt, ’B2; Tel-el-Kebir,
and Nile Expeditions, ’B4-5; Soudan Frontier
Force, ’B5 7 ; Gov.-General of Red Sea Littoral,
’BB-’92. Apparently Australia will never get rid
of the odour of Zulu and Soudani massacres. If
Australia ever has to defend itself it will be
against a civilised European enemy, and experience
gained in fighting badly-armed and undisciplined
savages will be useless. Wellington, when he
left India, entirely changed his system of tactics.
At Argaum and Assays he attacked the Mah-
rattas with all his force. In Spain and at Water-
loo he always stood on the defensive, and awaited
attack. Both plans succeeded because they were
suited to the conditions. But then every Soudan
colonel has not Wellington’s genius.
Austria has decided to tax cats. There
was nothing else in the whole empire that hadn’t
a duty on it —even chickens, geese, goats, and hogs
have been poll-taxed for many years past—and
now the cat goes the way of the rest and a beauti-
ful uniformity prevails. Austria, with its poor
soil, its eighteen or twenty separate tribes, most
of them hating each other, and speaking languages
which none of the others understands, its huge
debt, the vast army under which it has to stagger
in order to avoid being wiped out by its aggressive
neighbors, and its taxation system under which
it is hardly possible to fall down in the street
without paying a duty, is a wonderful example of
Thrift under the hardest conditions that can well
be imagined. The Australian Fat Man, wailing
over the prospective land-tax, should take a look
at this hard-driven community and shudder as he
realises what he may yet come to.
Dear Bulletin, —Much unfavorable com-
ment has been made on what is termed the dis-
proportion in the numbers of crew and passengers
saved from the Wairarapa. Perhaps the follow-
ing may be some explanation—l don’t say it is so.
The great bulk of passengers on an intercolonial
boat belong to the commercial class. When the
maritime strike occurred it was this class which
most strenuously opposed the endeavor of the
seamen to better themselves. Merchants, store-
keepers and clerks went out of their way to
leave their own employment to load and un-
load the ships. A seaman on strike is re-
garded as a public enemy whom it is the duty
of the whole community to oppose and defeat.
When a wreck occurs the same men are expected
to risk their own lives in the endeavor to provide
for the safety of those who have done their utmost
to deprive them of their livelihood —to see that all
the passengers are safely bestowed before they
venture to secure for themselve* a lifebelt or a
place in a boat. Jack, Oscar and Hans have hearts
as good and brave as anyone, but they have
memories also. —Yours, &c., Waihoa.

A cold begins with inflammation of the mem orr-
iieous lining of the intricate little passages o: the
mso (which is a Hampton Court labyrinth on a
.‘■mall scale). Homocea at once subdues the in-
flammation by reducing the swelling, and thereby
relieving the feeling of, “ stuffiness.’’ Moreover, it
forms a protective covering for the delicate mem-
brane, and prevents cold air, fog, or other irritating
vapour from getting at it. In influenza, Homocea
acts in the same way, and here the germ-killing
properties of the ointment further come into play.
Not much is known about the way in which influ-
enza originates, but it is quite clear that it is caused
by an invisible germ or microbe of some kin !.
Homoceamay, therefore, be confide ntlyrecom 2 u ’.
both as a cure and a preventive of influenza.
Stiff Joints, Pains in the Back, Lumbago,
Strained Muscles, Cramps, can be got rid
of at once by Homocea, which instantly
touches the spot afflicted. Homocea as a
pain relieving, soothing, and curative
lubricant has no equal in the world of
healing remedies; it is a specific for
Rheumatism, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Pa-
ralysis, Convulsions, Bruises, Strained

Henry M. Stanley writes : “ Whitehall,
London. Dear Sir, Your ointment called
1 Homocea ’ was found to be the most soothing
and efficacious unguent that I could possibly
have for my fractured limb, as it seems to retain
longer than any other, that oleaginousness so
requisite for perfect and efficient massage. The
fault of embrocations generally, is that they
harden and require warmth, whereas yours,
beside' being particularly aromatic, is as soft as
oil. and almost instantly mollifying in the case
Of severe inflammation.

CELLULAR AERTEX CLOTH is composed of small cells, in which
the air is enclosed and warmed by the heat of the body, a perfect
non-conducting layer being thus formed next the skin. Owing to the
cellular construction, this cloth is much lighter and better ventilated
than ordinary fabrics, easier to wash, and a positive safeguard against
Chills.

Fitzgeralds’ Circus was, at latest dates, painting the
town of Wellington red—not forgetting blue, green and
yellow. A little tiger has been born into the Fitz
menagerie since it reached Maoriland. Two or three
little tigers were born, no doubt, but only one of them
survives. The others died naturally or were swallowed
by their doting mother when she caught brother Tom

The bar of a Melb. theatre was the scene the other night
of a vigorous fist display between a popular baritone and
an inferior light playing in burlesque in another theatre.
The former, being muscular, wiped his smaller opponent
out in one act, and the latter’s face was closed for three
days for alterations and repairs.
The committee of the Distressed Actors’ Fund, Melb.,
advertises th.it after providing for the inmates of the
Home, a sum of money remains for outside distribution,
and invites members of the “ profesh ” who may be in

Haddon Chambers’ new play, “ John-a-Dreatna ” (writes
The Bulletin’s London correspondent), was produced on
November 9 at the Haymarket Theatre before an enthu-
siastic audience, the author receiving an unusually flatter-
ing ovation at the conclusion of the piece. It would be
rash to hastily express an opinion as to whether it is a
great play, or one which will stand the test of time—one
must see it two or three times before coming to a con-
clusion 6n these points—but, anyhow, it is a distinct
advance upon anything Chambers has done before, and
leaves “The Idler” far behind. So far, the critics are
unanimous in their approval. The play hinges upon a
very charming young woman, Kate Cloud—admirably re-
presented by Mrs. Patrick Campbell—who is presumably
the daughter of a “fallen woman,” and who, when her
mother comes upon bad times, sacrifices her virtue in
order to maintain her parent (this has been done before,
and well done, too, in Murray’s novel, “ A Song of Six-
pence This much we glean from a sort of confession
she makes to a very nice old country parson (Nutcombe
Gould). She is, in fact, a kind ©f alleviated “Second
Mrs. Tanqueray,” or, as the author euphemistically puts I
it, “ the hem of her garment is frayed.” Fortunately she j
comes under the influence of an old, benevolent lady—
who is not introduced to us, for the reason that
she is presumably dead—but who apparently does
rescue work in some great city, and has the good
fortune to tear Kate from her evil surroundings.
Later she finds herself on board a yacht in the Mediter-
ranean, as the guest of Lord and Lady Barbridge, where
Sir Hubert Garlinge (Charles Cartwright), makes violent
love to Kate, who cannot reciprocate his passion, for the
reason that there is on board, at the same time, one
Harold Wynn, called by his intimates John A’Dreams,
from his devotion to the stars and waves, about which he
writes uncommonly bad poetry. This gentleman (repre-
sented by Beerbohm Tree) has also fallen in love with Kate,
and upon these characters and their doings and comings
and goings the whole plot is worked, and worked for all
it is worth. Kate makes a confident of the old parson,
who is the father of Harold, carefully pumps the old
gentleman as to whether she is fit to marry an honour-
able man, and, having received an answer in the affirma-
tive, she tells him that the man who loves and wishes
to marry her is his son. The obvious horror of the
serious old preacher makes her at once determine
that she is no fit mate for a good man, and she
bids her lover good-bye for ever. Very soon after she
repents her decision and comes back and offers herself to
him “body and soul.” Garlinge overhears her, deter-
mines to make her his, and gives Harold a big dose of
opium, which puts him to sleep for 20 hours, at the end
of which period he awakes and proceeds, among a large
number of thrilling circumstances, to rescue his Kate
from a decidedly painful situation on board a yacht. The
aforesaid Cartwright, by the way, has bought the rights
of “ John-a-Dreams” for Australia. Haddon Chambers
has been reproached for his lack of capacity to write
comedy, but this charge can be no longer levelled against
him, as there is some admirable fun made by certain minor
characters.

Fitz Gibbon, the White Knight of Melbourne, who
travels on his inhuman dignity, never misses a show in
which any reference, however puerile, is made to his
almighty self. He books a front seat in the circle, and
lurks there till the allusion comes on; then he swells
visibly, and beams upon the audience. The most horrible
pun upon his name is incense to Fitz.—a tribute to his
grandeur. Dignity is usually vanity in the form of a
disease. y

escape. Next ight, Minnie’s husband hovered round in
the wings wilh a revolver, announcing his resolve to
shoot Ravelli if there was any more embracing ; and the
miserable tenor, realising that his life was in danger,
armed himself with a carving-knife with which to stave
off Minnie if she became too affectionate. Every time
Minnie approached hi r stage lovi r fled wildly across the
boards to avoid her, announcing in song, as he did so,
how he longed to take her to his arms, while Minnie
trotted after him in search of another hug.

MISS FO-FUM.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was a big yellow flower-pot that intro-
duced me to her—whirling perilously close to my
astonished nose before it smashed upon the cobble-
stones within 6ft. of me.
I looked up— and also, 1 suppose, looked foolish—
for she laughed until the pudding-faced lantern-
maker across the way waddled out with a fret-
saw in his hand and twinkling curiosity in the
little black eyes that were as currants unto the
pudding aforesaid.
“ Confound your notion of a joke ! ” I muttered,
with a growl that somehow twisted itself into a
laugh as I picked up a fragment of the pot to
pretend retaliation. Then I stood astonished ; for
the girl—a Chinese girl, on the porch-top of a
Chinese house—called out in unexceptionable
English—“ I’m sure I beg your pardon ! I didn’t
see you, you know. Do forgive me ! ”
I looked again. There was no doubt of it;
from her flower-decked ebony hair to her comical
little clumpy slippers, there was nothing un-
Chinese about her but her speech. The flower- pot,
I readily understood, was one of those which —
placed empty and mouth-outwards on the porch of
a Chinese house—proclaimed to all Mongolian
bachelors the husbandless condition of some slant-
eyed damsel within. And this English-speaking
virgo celestialis—h&xng doubtless a lady of superior
views—had, thus, with scorn and energy, cast
forth the symbolical earthenware.
And was this her father—this lean and leathery
pagan, beckoning to me from the door, and ex-
plaining to me, in that Canton “ pidgin ” which
it were distraction-to reproduce, that his daughter,
who was “all same English lady,” would be glad
to make for me tea and further apologies.
* » •
“In Calcutta,” she said. “I was eight
years there, and I had been at an English school
in Canton before that. But I am, in everything
else; even” —twinkling roguishly at me over a
miraculously-carved fan—“ even in religion !—a
Chinawoman altogether.”
“In which religion, may I ask ? There are three
in China, you know ! ”
“ And three hundred in England ! ” she
answered quickly. “ But I meant Buddhism.”
“ SVell, Buddhism’s as good a creed as any
other—and as bad ! ”
She held up a little lemon-tinted finger—not,
thank heaven ! adorned with a three-inch claw.
“ You don’t talk like a Christian,” she said.
“It would be strange if I did ! But, surely,
they tried to make one of you at your English
schools ? ”
She laughed till her gold tunic-links tinkled.
“ Oh, yes! —and they succeeded, too ! —as much as
they ever do—these wise teachers of yours, who
think that when they’ve got the shell they’ve got
the kernel! ”
In a dazed kind of way I looked round the
room. Grotesquely-twisted furniture ; ferociously
pictured screens; fantastically gorgeous porcelain
—Chinese enough, all this; and yet—this girl’s
talk—
“ Now, don’t look so astonished ! Don b your
own women think for themselves?”
“ They’re telling us very hard that they do,
just now, at all events. But I never heard one of
them take your view of the proselytising business.”
“ Do you take it ?”
“Oh, yes ! It’s a common enough view amongst
men.”
“ Christian men ! ” —and this extraordinary
young person laughed again till shespilt some of the
tea she was handing me. “ Do you know it seems
to me that the majority of Christian men are
simply Pagans at heart!”
“ Our own women have begun to tell us so,” I
said, getting up to go. “But they mean it for a
reproach. Do you?”
She put out her little yellow hand to be shaken.
“I mean it for the truth !” she said.
* * *
For a week I had matters in hand which
kept me from thinking much about my remark-
able little heathen, but, just as I was projecting
another call at the mcwson-Fo-Fum, I dropped
across her under extraordinary circumstances.
The gilded ball on the Van den Bosch monu-
ment was shining with the last of the sun as I
came towards it from the arsenal. Near its base
I saw two Dutch soldiers and a group of native
women whom I took to be of a class much
encouraged by the Dutch Government’s unwilling-
ness to let its warriors bring wives from Europe.
They were jabbering excitedly round some object
which I could not see, until the centre —breaking
suddenly through the circumference—came run-
ning towards me, for it was a woman.
“ A Chinawoman ! ” I said, as she came.
“Great Scott! it’s Miss Fo-Fum ! ”
Her hair, like a black horse’s tail, was stream-
ing over a tunic rent nearly from her back ; her
face was scratched and rand-stained ; she had lost
one of her slippers.
The Javanese women, cackling and squealing
behind her, pulled up at sightof a white man, and
scurried back after the two uniformed heroes, who
were not too drunk to be already making an un-
ostentatious departure.
“Don’t tell me any thing till you’ve recovered your
breath,” I said to the girl, who was twisting up
her hair and trying to reduce the gaps in her silk
tunic, the gold links of which, I noticed, had been
nearly all wrenched away. v
“See !” I said—“you have been robbed, also.”
“I have been robbed of ray secret!” she said,
angrily. “No —you must not see me home!
Neither must you come there any more !”
“ But ”
“ No ‘ huts,’sir ! Is it because I am a China-
woman that you would force yourself on me?”
She moved away a dozen yards—then came
suddenly back.
“Did you hear what those Javani beasts were
calling me? ” she asked.
“I understand very little Javanese ; none at all
of that kind ! I only noticed that one word was
often repeated. Something like ”
With a short scream—the only hysterical symp-
tom she had shown—she threw up her arms, and
rushed away into the dusk.
I stood, puzzled, where she had left me.
“ Whatever your mystery may be, young
woman,” I said, “it’s plain you’re a bit of a
Tartar! ”
• * •
The man looked away the moment he
caught my eye; but he was too late; I had
recognised him as one of the soldiers I had seen
with the Javanese women, a couple of nights
before—the more certainly that he rejoiced in the
double distinction of being pock-pitted and cross-
eyed. In-uad-out he. dodged me amongst the
bullock-carts and vegetable-stalls, till —finding he
couldn’t shake me off—he pulled up under a fish-
monger’s awning, and pretended immense interest
in a huge leopard-fish suspended by the door.
Next, of course, he wouldn’t understand my limp-
ing Dutch, until a small transaction in silver
made me vastly more intelligible, and elicited the
fact that he understood Malay, to boot.
“For,” said he, in answer to my questions, “ if
mynheer knows what Kusali means, he knows
what those yellow sluts were calling after t()e
Chinawoman, in their own lingo.”
“Good God, man! But, why to her?—She’s
no leper!”
“Her mother is, though !—an old woman living
in a hut down by the mangrove-flats. And this
one goes to visit her. And these Javani trollops
watched her, and followed her. And that’s all I
know, mynheer !”
“One tiling more!” I said, as,he saluted and
was right-about-facing for the nearest arrack-shop.
“If these wretches thought the girl had the
disease, they wouldn’t have gone so near her,
surely ?”
“They don’t think it, mynheer. It’s only spite,
because she’s a Chinawoman, and has money and
fine clothes. All the same, I don’t go near those
cursed yellow cats any more ; and I would take
the liberty of advising mynheer to keep away from
that girl’s house.”
“Do you think the disease is communicable,
then ? Your own regimental surgeon says it
isn’t.”
“ I know he does : and he’s been a whole six
months out from Europe. But I’ve been fiye-
and-twenty years in the East, and I say it’s
catching. And Notaf. Raud says so, too ! ”
Notaf Raud I had heard much of as a native
physician, and to him I went, tor I couldn’t help
being strongly interested in this extraordinary
girl, with her strong sense and sharply-cut indivi-
duality—her curious hybridity between Western
progressivism and Oriental immobility.
The Javanese oracle—a paunchy little pundit in
silver-rimmed glasses—smiled at my question.
“ Truly you Europeans are a strange people,”
he said. “ You are a thousand times more afraid
of catching a disease that takes many years to kill
than you are of contracting—say, cholera —which
may bring death in a few hours !”
I wasn’t going to wrestle with the Oriental
mind on this point—“ Would my learned friend
kindly adhere to the question ?”
My “ learned friend,” betaking himself unto the
Dutch tongue, became briefly explicit,
“ Leprosy is communicable ; certainly by con-
tagion—and possibly, also, by infection. But it is
not communicable to all persons. There is special
predisposition in certain individuals as in certain
races. Is mynheer scientifically interested in the
question ? If so, I can show him some beautiful
cases!”
“ Beautiful cases !” —the very jargon of the
European professional ghoul ! I told the man I
had seen cases enough, and went away painfully
endeavouring to prevent my ghastly recollections
thereof from connecting themselves with thoughts
of my bright little pagan.
* * *
On a Dutch-India steamer, eight months
afterwards, I met a Sourabaya-man I knew.
“Do you remember the little Chinawoman I
used to tell you about? ” I said.
“ Oh, yes ! Let’s see ! —what was it you used
to call her ? Miss ”
“ Miss Fo-Fum 1 ”
“To be sure! Yes! Poor thing I—poor
thing ! ”
“ Worse ! Sent to Garka ! ”
“Garka?”
“ Ay ! the new establishment for lepers 1 ”
ALEX. MONTGOMERY.
Dear Bulletin, —In re laughing-jackass
discussion. As “Wurry M.” remarks, he kills
chickens. He also destroys eggs. He is also a
great fish-eater, a fact not generally known.
With regard to his alleged usefulness, he un-
doubtedly kills an occasional snake —in which
sphere of activity an ordinary bush cafe (which is
not protected) will beat him hollow. At no very
distant date many varieties of Australian snakes
will become extinct, and the jackass will continue
to ravage his feathered co-mates. In the interests
of Australian birds no special protection should be
afforded that wholesale robber and murderer—the
goburra.—P.L.
In the October Idler, Jerome K. Jerome
floats himself and four others into a co. to work
off an Australian story. Jerome does the first
chapter, introducing as his chief character the
Bar-keeper. “ Bar-keeper ”is the name given in
Australia to the man who runs a bush shanty.
When said bar-keeper rides abroad he hears the
whispering of the pines. “Pines” compose the
Australian “ forest. ” Jerome’s bar-keeper kills a
sick man for bis belt of gold, and then one Eden
Phillpotts takes up the tired tale. The pre-
dominant note of this chapter is that the local
inspector of police (sergeants do not have districts
in Australia) is “’Spec.” Eden’s contribution to
geography is “Flying Fox Corner.” When E. F.
Bensen comes along he exhibits his specialty,
which is Australian conversation. This is the way
his Australian actress (and every real specimen)
speaks :
“ I’ll be stepping down.” “ The trial will now be com-
mencing.” “Don’t be scatterin’ inspersions over others.”
Her habit is to drop the g’s, but sometimes she
drops the habit. When they give the lady a
drink, she says :—-
“ Who stands treat?” (Australian slang).
And the bar-keeper replies :
“The loss is the bank’s.” (An expression borrowed
from the Australian national game of Faro).
F. Frankfort Moore imports Choke-neck Gulch
into the 4th chapter. “ Choke-neck Gulch ”is the
resort of criminals. Australian criminals establish
exclusive colonies in “ gulches,” where the police
don’t disturb them. In the last chapter, Barry
Pain has to find a lost diamond. He makes a
man disembowel his dead brother with a clasp-
knife. The dead brother had swallowed the dia-
mond. Choke-neck Gulch 1 Choke-neck Gulch !

“Every man can write at least one book,” every
man with brains has at least one good story to
tell; every man with or without brains moves in
a different circle and knows things unknown to
any other man. Write carefully and plainly on
one side of the paper only, obliterating every un-
necessary word; then mail your work to The
Bulletin, which pays for accepted matter. In
certain of the so-called prize-competitions the
great prizes fall to the newspaper-proprietor, who
gets the guileless public to work for him for noth-
ing. Short stories, or ballads, especially on bush,
mining, sporting, social, or dramatic themes, are
preferred by The Bulletin ; 1360 words go to a
column. If you can possibly keep your story
within a column all the better , Don’t write a
column on any subject if a half-column will do ;
don’t write half-a-column where a mere paragraph
is enough. “ Boil it down.”
Suggestions for illustration with or without
rough explanatory drawings will be gladly re-
ceived bv The Bulletin.
