Smashing Victory Over All Comers
in 5-Mile Race at Victoria Park, N.S.W., 2-10- 23
When the great “Riot of Speed” Contest held at Victoria Park, N.S.W., thrilled to a close, the Citroen had vanquished a
field representing the highest-class cars in Australia, passing the post ahead of makes that were immensely advantaged in
Power and Size.
CITROEN STILL HOLDS THE WORLD’S RECORD, as well as the Australian Record, for PETROL ECONOMY—every
Reliability contest in which it has entered has added to its laurels, whilst its SPEED-VICTORY at Victoria Park, when
it averaged about 50 M.P.H. on a course where turns had to be negotiated carefully, caps the Climax of Citroen

Up comes the day, a miracle of light
Kissing with loveliness the trembling blue.
The dear familiar hills are built anew,
The silver Yarra blossoms into sight.
A sweetness from the heavens’ purest height
Takes all the valley airs ; and mountain-
dew,
Soft-blooming, touches with its magic hue
The dreaming river-slopes of Warfandyte.
These" did he love, 1 * our lost Mercutio,
And dipt his brush in morning-dew to make
Sweet symphonies of light and loveliness,
And sunny visions shimmering in the glow
Of high Australian noons, and dawns that
break —
As this dawn breaks —in joyousness.

ADRIAN LAWLOR.
Is Repetition Bad Art?
“Let me, since even the first command-
ment of Impressionism is probably unfamiliar
to the Anglo-Saxon reader, repeat this
formula in another image. That is bad Art;
but I hope to be pardoned by the shades of
my Masters.” So writes Ford Madox
Hueffer in “Thus to Kevisit” ; and he goes
on to illustrate his subject with the very
illuminating example of the impressionist-
artifice of l’odmore’s brother.
“That is bad Art.” Why? Mr. Hueffer,
as his own statements inform us, is in the
happy position of being regarded, at once by
lumself and by a large critical public, as
an artist in prose. Yet upon occasion we
see liis practice flying full in the face of his
declared theory; and nobody, I think, who
reads that section of his book (Part III —■
“The Battle of the Poets”), whence the
above extract is taken, and sees just how the
first commandment of Impressionism is ren-
dered eminently clear by the indicted anec-
dote of Podmore’s famous brother, will
entertain the slightest doubt that practice
justifies itself. In fact, this writer’s own
method turns King’s evidence, and establishes
beyond question the culpability of his literary
creed.
Shelley, telling of that ancient and most
tragical of narks, the metamorphosis of
syrinx to a reed in the arms of Pan, says:
“Gods and men, we are all deluded thus.”
There are, not unfrequently, times when
(with a just possible reservation in the case
of the gods) I am sorely tempted to apply
the words to that most unfortunate Cyclo-
pean (or, as we now say, one-eyed) mortal,
the man who is in the deadly grip of a
theory, a theory to which all facts must fit,
even facts so stubbornly contrary that, to
permit of the ineffable consummation, they
must be distorted beyond recognition.
Surely, too, if Mr. Hueffer’s dictum holds
true for prose, a very sound case can be made
out for its application, in an even stricter
degree, to the realm of verse, in which con-
ciseness of expression is a necessity still
more real and imminent than it is in prose.
Yet what do we find? One of Sliakspeare's
very finest sonnets (No. 129) —which, by
the way, for sheer magnificence of power has
perhaps only a single rival, in the shape of.
Milton’s “collect in verse,” “On the Late
Massacre at Piedmont” —is nothing less than
a riot of a formula repeated in other images.
Again, in the couplet of Sonnet No. 109
we have
For nothing- this wide universe I call
Save thou, my rose: in it thou, art my all.
“In it thou art my all.” That is repetition.
Is it bad Art? Or would the author of
“Thus to Revisit” agree with you and me,
and call it an example of a lively enthusi-
asm, resulting, when expressed, in a fine
excess ?
What, after all, is the narrative-scheme of
“The Ring and the Book” (with its lesser
parallel in prose supplied by, for instance,
.Wilkie Collins’s “The Moonstone”), but the
repetition of a formula in a whole series of
images? Are we to condemn Francis Thomp-
son’s “Coi-ymbus for Autumn” because of the
very fact which largely makes for its excel-
lence, namely, that it exhibits a profuse-
ness, a variety of imagery surpassed, per-
haps, by that of no poem in the. language?
Do not the Psalms of David, the Books of, Job
and of Ruth —whose precedent Mr. Hueffer
so very confidently (and, indeed, with much
point and justice) adduces as an unassail-
able justification for the right-to-be of vers
libre —abound in examples of a motif or a
circumstance being presented from more than
one point of view, i.e., in a formula repeated
in an additional image? Indeed, is not this
device one of the chief and characteristic
beauties of Plebrew poetry in general?
But instances, both in verse and prose, are
as abundant as green leaves in springtime,
We all know, of course, that there are
certain occasions, and many of them, when
the repetition of a formula in a fresh image
would indeed be bad Art. After the tragedy
of Lear has been played to its “bitter-sweet
end” we do not look for an additional scene
(a sort of transposed Shavian introduction),
expounding the legal aspects of inheritance
in the female line. I have yet to meet the
man to whom it is a genuine source of worry
that “Hamlet” lacks an apologue, wherein
is set forth a critical review of the chief
events of the story by the court historian.
Nor does the world really need a Marxian
sequel to ‘-‘Tess of the D’Urbervilles.” In
other words, being arrived, in any branch of
literature, at a climax, we naturally either
cease abruptly, or, after the fashion of the
Greek dramatists, slowly withdraw from the
catastrophe experiencing a sense of the
dawning beauty of repose. We certainly do
not want a repetition in a fresh guise. But
if, in the course of handling a theme, where
it takes the form, entirely or largely, of
straight out discussion, or exposition (the
position in the instance forming our text) ;
where it lends itself to rhetorical treatment;
wherever, in fact, anything is gained, in the
way of clarity, emphasis, poignancy, humor,
whimsicality, or anything else by the use of
repetition ; then repetition is not only not
bad. but is good Art. Our artist in prose,
in accepting so limited a rule as the one in
question as a law, admitting of no or few
exceptions, has, I fancy, caught hold of what
liis own verve for capitals might perhaps
express as the Wrong End of the Stick.
RICHARD MEREDITH.
As D. H. Lawrence Sees Us
Many people have tried to draw Sydney in
letters; but on analysing the draughtsman-
ship one has a feeling that the result has
been an outward simulacrum rather than an
inward reality, the shadow of a shade rather
than a living truth. But D. H. Lawrence,
who seems to have lived for some months in
a little South Coast town and ultimately
found Australia a hard country to drag his
heartstrings from, has drawn Sydney as she
really is—one of the world’s great cities, in-
habited by a huge and gentle race of men,
and by women “nearly but not quite beauti-
ful,” who have" such an amazing power of
governing themselves that one seldom sees a
policeman ; a city that sits dreaming of her
future in a delicious climate, while her poli-
ticians incessantly strive to get her to
squabble about nothing, though her people
are so gentle and kindly that it is difficult
to make them fight unless there is something
to fight about. The story of Kangaroo
(Seeker, London) is slight; hardly worth
telling. The characterisation is good, but
not overwhelmingly good ; in Kangaroo him-
self there are gleams of mysticism that seem
strange in an Australian politician. • But it
is Sydney that is the real heroine of the
book: Sydney with her blue skies paling to
the horizon, and clear air, her sunshine and
glowing sunsets, her.warm delights of living
and the mile-long surf that forever beats on
her ocean beaches ; the vivid contrast between
her gentle peace and the savage fury of
England during the last few yeats of the
war, when England was fighting for her very
life as she had never fought before.
Of course, this novel is merely a symptom
of that post-war neurasthenia which has so
befallen the Old Country, and its hero is a
typical “pommy” neurasthenic who finds our
friendliness and absence of social distinctions
a little perplexing, and at first even alarming.
But he is ultimately converted to love the
freedom of Australia. It is rather striking to
watch how he becomes affected by the quaint
wrangles about the inevitable “cat-rabbit”
cross of The Bulletin’s Aboriginalities
column, and the terrific tales about giant
goannas and fierce, escaped cats run wild.
That Mr. Lawrence has been able to observe
that in the Abo. column lies the real heart
of Australia shows how accurately he has
read this country. But he is less respectful
to the “Pink Page,” and shows it less venera-
tion than would appear proper to many of
its writers. But, after all, as he would be
the first to suggest, what better could you
expect from a pommy? He carefully ex-
plains the derivation of “pommy,” and is
quick to show that it is not necessarily an
epithet of contempt; in fact, he is singularly
understanding both of our slang and of our
other little ways—especially of the typical
Australian resentment of anything like an
assertion of social superiority.
At first his pommy hero is dismayed by
the well-fed taxi-driver who asks a shilling
apiece for carrying handbags across Mac-
quarie-street, nor can his rigid little Eng-
lish soul quite grasp why his neighbors
should expect to be friendly during the first
■week of his stay in his bungalow; but he
quickly settles down to the universal friend-
liness, and describes Sydney, its weather, its
harbor, its ferries and all else that is liers
as lyrically as if he had been a poet who had
lived here all his life and loved Sydney as
a mistress. But it is not quite clear why he
and his wife, loving Australia as they do,
should go out of their way to leave it. Still,
we must remember that the hero is a typical
neurasthenic, made restless and unhappy by
the brutal conduct of the soldiers during the
last few months of the war in England; a
poor little sick man at war with his own soul
and finding peace nowhere. It would be in-
teresting to learn how much of this novel is
autobiographical. Personally, I should
hazard a guess and say a great deal; but I
don’t like to probe into Mr. Lawrence’s
heart. Anyhow, he has written a very beau-
tiful book that is full of the sunshine and
flowers of Australia, with many quiet little
gibes at our peculiarities at rvliich nobody
could take offence unless he is determined to
take offence. i
You cannot understand “Kangaroo” unless
you remember that Mr. Lawrence started as
a collier and educated himself mainly by
drinking at the shrine of St. Freud; that he
is at heart an antinomian, a rebel against
society and its moral code; and that some
of his books have been censored as indecent
in England. That he has been able to edu-
cate himself into his present beautiful style
speaks well for his sense of English and for
his power to imitate Thomas Hardy, whom,
as well as St. Freud, he also worshipped and
tried to copy. I have not read his other
books, but I understand that some of them
are “quite shocking” ; as though his uncon-
scious mind were writing all the suppressed
dirt of an educated and right-thinking man—
were, in short, becoming his conscious mind.

Classicism, Musical and Other
It was a strange thesis that Lester Way
developed in his “Defence of Musical Igno-
rance” (R.P. 1/11/’23). I am one of the
laymen whose ignorance he sets out to de-
fend, but I am also one of those who are
making assaults on the castles of classic-
ism, since I have become the custodian of
an excellent pianola. I have as little know-
ledge of musical technique as Lester Way
claims, but I am quite content to follow the
orthodox critics and accept their dictum
that Beethoven’s “Waldstein Sonata” and
the Overture from “Tannlhiuser,” although
I am unable to play them except on a musi-
cal-box, are more meritorious works than
“Bimini Bay,” even though a busy man may
be put to the inconvenience of having to
listen to them more than once in order to
find out what they are about. Not being
in such a hurry as Lester Way, I am quite

mystery. I find that they respond to the
test in' just the same way as a poem by
Meredith does, or a picture by Hilder. I
have only a glimmering of their meaning,
but I feel that it is there, because the more
familiar I become with them the more plea-
sure I get out of them, whereas I do not find
more and more depths in “Nellie Bly” the
more often I hear it. I have tried the
experiment of stripping the “Friihlingsrau-
schen,” which is a flagrant example of the
musical verbosity Lester Way complains of,
down to its theme ; but the result was not
inspiring. Whatever charm the piece had
for me was immediately dissipated, and I
was forced to the conclusion that when the
composer added his frills to the garment he
was a good tailor and knew what he was
doing.
The theory that a work of art can be
stripped to its shirt, so to speak, and still
remain a work of art, leads us into queer
corners. Lester Way would doubtless be
annoyed if an economical publisher saved
printers’ ink and paper by condensing
“What Maisie Knew” down to the starkly
honest statement that “only God and Henry
James know what she knew, and neither of
them are telling.” The theme of the Song
of Solomon, of “Nostromo,” of the Odyssey,
of Thomas Hardy’s “Dynasts” could each be
expressed in 20 words. Tolstoi required
1600 pages of modern print to develop his
theme in “War and Peace,” yet it could be
abbreviated into the statement that
Napeoleon was a fool and didn’t know it.
Even Wordsworth, whom Lester Way
acclaims as the poet of themes without frills,
required to spread himself over 14 lines
to explain to an indifferent world that he
suffered from insomnia.
Lester Way tells us that the classical com-
posers—he does not appear to make any ex-
ceptions—deliberately wrote difficult music
in order to shut out the rising Bolshevism of
this age of cheap pianos and violins, to main-
tain the realm of music as a preserve of aris-
tocratic privilege. When did this conspiracy
first take shape? Beethoven’s “Appassion-
ata” is a striking example of all that Lester
Way contemns. Its theme is a common-
place affair of four notes. It is full of
trills and frills and musical verbiage. Did
Beethoven foresee this era of gramophones
and suburban pianists and deliberately build
on a trumpery theme an enormous super-
structure of “meaningless trimmings” merely
to serve the purposes of a counter-revolu-
tion in the next century?
M. G. S.
The Personal Touch
“C.0.M.” (R.P. 8/11/’23) objects to my
suggestion that in order to increase the
number of their readers Australian poets
need something similar to what is provided
by the literary press of Britain in fascinat-
ing articles of criticism and appreciation,
with just the tiniest element of personal in-
terest to give them a note of intimacy. To
emphasise liis objection, “C.0.M.” says that
I advocate for our writers advertisement such
as the movie-picture stars get, with any
amount of tittle-tattle about their person-
ality. I do nothing of the sort. No one
could characterise as gossip-mongering the
articles of appreciation and criticism in the
literary press of the old country—in such
papers, to give but one instance, as those
edited by the late Sir William Robertson
Nicoll. From many I chose in illustration
those of Katherine Tynan, because they had
sent me to read Francis Thompson. William
Butler Yeats, Alice Meyncll and others. No
one in his senses would call Katherine
Tynan a gossip-monger. Iler articles make
a strong appeal to the majority of readers,
if not to the serious literai-y student. If we
had such writers here our Australian poets
would be read more and would sell better.
But “C.0.M.” objects to any “talk” about
writers. Has he forgotten that the prince
of all gossip-mongers was, is and probably
ever shall be, “Bozzy”? But for Boswell
the ponderous doctor would be nothing but
a name. Having read the “Life,” most
people would take “Rasselas” or “The Lives
of the Poets” from the library shelves. It
is largely due to Boswell’s love of gossip
and tittle-tattle that Johnson’s name is likely
to be immortal.
“C.0.M.” would have our poets appeal
only to the well-regulated mind which is
capable of understanding them —a type of
mind which A. C. Benson tells us is as un-
common as it is intolerable. Between the
literary student and the gossip-monger
“C.0.M.” sees no middle-class. Yet there
lies the great bulk of readers; and it is their
interest which must be roused if Australian
writers are to get the following they desire.
Wasn’t it Stevenson who thought public taste
must be a mongrel product out of Affecta-
tion by Dogmatism? And somebody said;
“It is not taste which is plentiful but courage
which is rare”—-if you could only find an
honest man of no special literary bent he
would probably tell you he didn’t care much
for Shakspeare. So, too, if you can find an
honest reader of no special literary bent,
he will tell you that, unless our Wrights,
McCraes, Wilcoxes, etc., touch some personal
chord, he sees nothing of their work after
the current number of The Bulletin or
other paper has gone to that bourne from
which no well-read paper returns. Some-
times he (or morely likely she) will cut out
a piece which makes a special appeal, but
rarely, very rarely, will he buy the poems
in book form unless the writer has something
to say to him. This fact has been greatly
lamented by recent Red Pagers, wherefore
I came forward with my suggestion. What
has been done in Britain by writers of the
Katherine Tynan type can be done here also
with great advantage to our Australian
poets. Montaigne, Addison and Lamb have
never lost their hold upon the general read-
ing public as Macaulay, Matthew Arnold
and Walter Pater have done, and that is be-
cause they put themselves into their work.
Recent essayists have again made a vogue
of personality, e.q., Max Beerbohm, Hilaire
Belloc, “Alpha of the Plough” and Richard
King, all of whom are read even in small up-
country libraries. Whether it be for good
or for ill, the fact remains that the personal
touch does attract a following, and that is
what our Australian writers most need.

Imprisoned Prose
Much has been said for and against I ree
Verse. Satirists have lampooned it with all
the facility to which the freak lends itself,
and protagonists have fought them off with
all the valor of a hen defending a china egg.
Yet nothing is said of an apparently _anti-
thetical, yet closely related, branch of litera-
ture, Imprisoned Prose. Free Verse is sup-
posed to burst all bounds and defy all rules
in its assertion of liberty. Imprisoned Prose,
on the other hand, is rigidly suppressed; it
may only be guessed at. It is not a very
subtle art, but neither is Free Verse for that
matter. It has many exponents in modern
fiction, especially in that class of authors
which have found that a row of asterisks
across a page conveys a certain punch of
immoral suggestiveness and dodges the cen-
sor. It never had any right to be out ot
” Among writers of repute and respectability
the most eminent prose gaoler is H. G. Wells.
Take a supposititious sample from, say,
“Utopias to Order,” or “Gods Like Wells,’ or,
better still, from one in his earlier manner,
which we may call “An Adventure in the
First Dimension”: “There was a flash of
colored fire. . . .vast movements of imponder-
able matter Mr. Counterjump’s brain
reeled. .. .rocked with surprise.... He was
perplexed puzzled bewildered .... you
picture him looking 50... . looking straight
ahead (the only way he could look in this
strange land) ... .straight over the line of
type trees and seeing beyond a sort of waste,
punctured by little oases... .intermittent. ..
desert.... .the Desert of Ellipses. Beyond
aghin more type jungle and more desert
with the oases three in a row. ... always
three....the same three in a row.... His
imagination baulked at them....what did
they signify?. . . .He wondered what. ...
So do we. The impression sought to be
conveyed is, of course, that of a great cre-
ative mind bursting with effort to describe
the indescribable. It really looks more like
the manufacturer of the bizarre suffering
from an exhaustion of formulas, in which
case the business seems rather like a spoof,
and there is really nothing suppressed at all.
Somewhat similarly A. S. M. Hutchinson
fills up the mental hiatus in the much-
boomed “If Winter Comes” with scraps of
sentences like this: “He reflected.... funny
....He didn’t know, but perhaps....” and
so on ad nauseam, with that irritating
“funny” recurring again and again, regard-
less of the fact that the situation was never
in the least degree amusing.
When you come to examine it. this sort
of prose would make very fair Free Verse,
if sorted out; but Wells, at any rate, finds
it a darned sight more profitable to put the
world right in prose—and ellipses.
ALEX. SOMERVILLE.
Henry Lawson
Randolph Bedford writes of a purple pall:
The Henry Lawson Memorial Fund sticks at a
few hundred pounds, and a statue of the good crafts-
man, good Australian and good mate will cost
£2OOO. I believe that the proper people to make
the money good have not been approached. On
September 4, 1922, Henry Lawson’s body was given
a State funeral. Came Judges and Generals, Uni-
versity Senators and Legislative Councillors; there
were Millions Clubs and aldermen and town clerks
and publicity-chasers in long coats and tall hats,
seeking a little of the reflected glory of one whom
in life they did not understand and from whom many
of them had fled at high speed. The central figure
in all that pomp was our old friend Henry under his
purple pall. And to many of the self-advertisers
there that ended Henry Lawson, as it had begun
him. In a few days the Melbourne Argus fund
for the “loyal” police of Victoria touched £7OOO.
There is advertised in Sydney a fund for a per-
manent memorial to “our late beloved Governor, Sir
Walter Davidson,” who had no effect on Australian
life, as Lawson had much —an effect not yet depart-
ing and probably not yet at its peak. The Governor
memorial will find fat funds for itself from the
people who give with their heads and a lively sense
of the value of publicity; but there are certainly
50,000 Australians who will throw a bob into the
hat in the name of the good Australian who knew
and loved them well. That is the best kind of
statue for an Australian writer —the statue made by
the bushmen, who are well read where the city Aus-
tralian is but well journalised. The bush will put
up the money for the Lawson statue, the larger citi-
zens who gathered round his purple pall having de-
parted upstage. The proper sympathy to enlist is
the sympathy of the A.W.U. I believe that I can
say for the men of the Warrego that they will do
their bit at the tarpaulin muster.
Yes, but why don’t they? Everybody in
Australia knows that Lawson is dead; prac-
tically everybody knows that a committee lias
been appealing for funds. Apparently the
thing must be a job for one enthusiast in
his own district. .Tim Grahame, verse-
maker, of Leeton, called for shillings in his
neighborhood, and sent along 20 or .50
pounds. A hundred Jim Grahames would do
all that is wanted.
“C. I am afraid that “Macnade” (R.P.
22/11/’23) has taken both Akhenaton and my ironical
little paper about him as solemnly as an Egyptologist,
which, thank Heavens, I do not profess to be, or e'se
I should have to believe the dreams on which David
Wright, in the same number, has cast such well-
merited scorn. I am quite prepared to believe that
Akhenaton had the typical skull of a religious re-
former, and that was why he was one; but, with
sincere respect for Grafton Elliot Smith, I do not see
how anybody could diagnose epilepsy or hallucina-
tions from the shapp of the bony case in which the
brain is contained. Nor do I believe that Akhenaton
was the first man to “recognise” that God is a
loving Father. The idea is as mystical as St. John s
“God is Love,” from which I might as well diagnose
that John was an early Freud and sex-intoxicated.
Without going into the ancient problem of the
source of Evil it seems to me that the late war has
thrown slight discredit on St. John s notion ; but,
just as I do not profess to be an Egyptologist and
dream dreams about things that no person can pos-
sibly know, so I do not profess to be a theologian
and waste my life in trying to find out how many
angels can dance on the point of a needle and how-
three things can be the same as one. The fact
that I was trying to infer in my essay was that
the Egyptologists are rapidly becoming as mystical
and incomprehensible as the theologians, and are
trying to date back to Akhenaton’s times ideas that
are probably inherent in the mysticism of Christi-
anity ; only I was not so rude as to say so about
men whose learning, but not whose judgment, I
respect enormously. But I do think it is a pity
that, men should become so hypnotised by their
work as to dream vain things.
THE SONNET FORM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Myself I question: Had I lived among
Pedantic souls, pretentious in their speech,
And fashioned forms of verse when I was young —
The forms that scholars of precision teach,
In lines correct, with rules controlling each —-
Would I, a mongrel bard, have given tongue
To simple songs, in jingle-metre sung,
Or striven those Olympian heights to reach
Where critics sit in judgment, praises warm
Bestowing on the learned Chosen Few
Who rhyme by rules wherefrom they ne’er depart,
Nor ever condescend, in Culture’s view,
To touch a chord in any common heart,
Whilst keeping strictly to the Sonnet form ?
I wonder. But my lines of life were cast
In places where no literary school
Proclaimed the glory of a long-dead past,
Or taught the pupil, staring from his stool
Of meek- submission, whilst his blood ran cool,
That classic similes must still outlast
All newer ones, withstanding bitter blast
Of modern ridicule from ribald fool.
Unheeding literary breeze or storm,
Deriding Culture as a Bunthornc pose,
I sang crude ballads in my misspent youth;
And, now my day is drawing to its close,
Am still persuaded there is more of truth
In jingle metre than in Sonnet form.
I love it not; too obvious the strain
Imposed on strongest masters of an art
That all may toy with. Lo! these lines explain
That even I, thus late, have made a start —
My Pegasus encumbered with a cart —
To guide the sorry steed, with tightened rein,
A measure of achievement to attain.
E’en I might sing of Cupid and his dart,
But will not: nor of Hymen and the swarm
Of Grecian myths. Be mine the human themes
Which interest the vulgar minds of such
As, blind to pure poetic plans and schemes,
May listefi when the lute-strings light I touch,
And sing my song —but not in Sonnet form.
VICTORIA.
EDMUND FISHER.
A Satchel of Books
Humors of Golf, by W. Heath Robinson (Methuen
and Co.). Those who know' this artist’s rich sense
of fun can imagine the comical effects he gets when
he applies it to Colonel Bogey’s pastime. The book
is one long grin, and a heaven-sent pick-me-up in
these days of income-tax returns.
Epithalamium (Heinemann). A translation of the
novel by Jacques Chardonne that won last year’s
Northc’iffe Prize. It is a study of the spiritual trials
that beset young married people in the year or so
following on the honeymoon. But perhaps its chief
interest to Australians will consist in the pleasant
picture it offers: of life in an ordered French home.
Flaminy Youth, by Warner Fabrian (Paul and Co.,
London).' The story of an American smart-set family
—father, mother and three daughters—with the pro-
miscuity of baboons. The suggestion is that it is
a serious-minded attempt to pillory a phase of trans-
Atlantic society; but the publishers are indirectly
more candid in plastering the cover with the legend:
“One of the best-selling novels in America.”
A Son at the Front, by Edith Wharton. This
labors under the handicap of being a war novel.
The plot is a variant on one that has been much
exploited: the hero is a young man who, while
fondly believed bv his family to be in a base job, is
playing a gallant part in the front line. However,
the writer compensates by the art with which she
presents her characters, and by a wealth of feminine
insight and humor.
Another Scandal, by Cosmo Hamilton (Hurst and
Blackett). This is a sequel to Hamilton s Scandal,
in which the original reckless heroine indulges in
another escapade in order to madden her artless
husband. The book is the usual Hamilton achieve-
ment, wherein the palpitating- reader is lured up to
the thin ice, but never has the gratification ot
falling- in.
Among the books turned out by Ward, Lock and
Co., in time for the Christmas-gift trade, are The
Twins of Emu Plains, by Mary Grant Bruce; 'Hie
Adopted Family, by Isabel M. I’eacocke ; Sheila the
Prefect, by Lillian M. Pyke; and The Dream Girl’s
Garden, by Kdith Howes. All four authors are
favorites with the Australian girl, and they will lose
nothing of their popularity by these latest booas.
each of which has a good story in a sane and
healthy setting-.
Gallipoli, by John Masefield (Heinemann). A
passage from the preface to the eighth edition pro-
vides a fair idea of the whole book. He has been
discussing the section in America that hates the
British:—
“This seems to be a wandering from the dead in
Gallipoli, in their graves among the tamarisks; but
it is not so. Wherever they lie they call in their
mute way to all the world to think well of this
country; for they were free men who gave their
lives for an idea. They lie quiet, and are done
with trouble. .. . There are thirty-eight thousand of
them: the manhood of a city. Eight years ago they
were the pick of a race that cares for freedom,
coming as the freight of 50 ships, to fight things
stronger than themselves.”
A little too self-consciously melodious, it may be
said: rather too perfect an exposition of the art of
fine writing. But, then, it is sincere, which atones
for all. A genuine reverence for the fighters, and
more especially for the Australians, glows through
the book like an honest, steady light. It is not
in any sense a history ; hardly one prominent officer
is mentioned. But in conjunction with such a
work as Bean’s “Story of Anzac” it is invaluable,
for it interprets with a poet’s insight the soul of
the army that made this splendid failure.
The Mystery of Norman’s Court, by John Chan-
cellor (Hutchinson). The one thing necessary for
the solution of this sort of murder mystery before
you come to the conclusion is to eliminate every
person who appears to wear a guilty flush or would
derive some advantage from the homicide, and then
fasten the crime on the apparently innocent house-
maid who was calmly-dusting the -t'iara ins the pivot: bou-
doir when the body was discovered. The plot here is
fairly ingenious, but the writing is not, persuasive,
and the hero, who relates the yarn in the first person,
strains terribly to expose his own mobility of
character.
The Garden of God, by H. de Vere Stacpoole
(Hutchinson). A tale of Dick, the castaway, who
became the emperor of a Pacific island and acquired
a beauteous brown maiden in the process. Its worst
weakness is the automatic removal of characters when
they become superfluous to the yarn. When
the' author finds that the faithful Kearney, who had
brought no Dick from infancy, promises to be a
forbidding “gooseberry” in the budding romance, he
lias the veteran massacred by a giant decapod in a
coral lagoon. Since Kearney had voluntarily given
up his coarse pleasures to become nurse, counsellor
and guide to the hero, his removal from the stage
is grossly ungrateful.
Prejudices (Third Series), by H. L. Mencken
(Jonathan Cape). Here are more sardonic after-
thoughts on drama, life and literature, with a few-
stray notes on some well-known personalities. The
opening article, “On Being an American,” is a
facile elaboration of a previous “prejudice” on
American democracy. Mencken’s contempt for the
orthodox and the obvious is as wide and startling
as his enthusiasm for the new and untried; and even
if the reader disagrees with some of his opinions,
he is bound to be impressed by these furtive peeps into a
strangely diverting and cultivated mind. For instance,
no poet who takes himself seriously will be exhilarated
by the Mencken attitude to his art as exhibited on
pages 146-170; but, all the same, the article con-
tains many truths, and its humor, and trenchancy
give it a strong appeal to lovers of good prose.

In 1852, Studebaker’s net assets
were £l4 and two forges. There
were three employees and the
first year’s sales were two wagons.
Today, Studebaker’s net assets
amount to £18,500,000, including
£9,500,000 invested in factory fa-
cilities. The Studebaker payroll
now numbers 20,000 employees.
Sales for the first six months of
1923 totalled 81,880 cars.
Tremendous growth has been the
reward for Studebaker’s strict
adherence to the highest stand-
ards of quality.

The
OUR LATEST
Windmill
To meet the demands of those
who require a moderate quantity
of water at a moderate head, the
Busy B Windmill has been manu-
factured.
It is of extremely high quality
and efficiency, and a thorough
mechanical proposition.
Where the quantity of water desired does not
warrant the installation of a geared or other high-
priced type, the Busy B will be found very suitable.
It is of the direct-acting type, giving a working stroke to the pump
at each revolution of the wind wheel.
The wind wheel is thoroughly braced and bolted and built up
of steel sections; it follows the design of our Billabong standard,
which has always proved a superior wheel.
The Busy Bis the very thing you have wanted: something that was
cheap and at the same time capable of filling your tanks and troughs.

Hereafter.
When I am dead and laid to rest
Hard by the church in the orchard land,
Will you come hitherward wandering
Hereafter, on a day of Spring,
And pause a moment where I lie
Shut out for ever from the sky?. . ..
When I am dead and laid to rest
Hard by the church in the orchard land? •
Yes, you will come and you will stand
Just for an instant close at hand,
When violets blow and overhead
The birds sing requiem for the dead.
And read my name, remembering me
And all that once was wont to be. . . .
When I am dead and laid to rest
Hard by the church in the orchard land.
“Lie lightly, Earth, upon her breast!
I loved her once; she loved me best.
She was the blossom of a day
To pluck, to wear, to throw away—
Too slight a piece of womanhood
To hold a man in serious mood.
And now she’s dead and laid to rest
Hard by the church in the orchard land.”
Love dies; regret is writ in sand.
From out the gardens of the west
You’ll pass into the world once more—
That outer world of rush and roar.
And yet, who knows? When worn with strife
Some memory of the inner life
May teach you love is something worth
Here on this cold and heathen earth—
Kind, faithful love long laid to rest
Hard by the church in the orchard land!

Bull Dog Lead.
I never was at Bull Dog Lead,
I cannot tell where it may be.
I know not if its tracks proceed
On inland plains or by the sea;
And yet I somehow seem to know
All things that Bull Dog Lead would show.
The dusty tips are gaunt and bare,
And rusted tin and rotted wood
And broken doors are scattered there
Where once the busy mine-sheds stood ;
And flooded shafts and cages old
Speak still the ancient search for gold.
And down the sides of tracks forgot
Are huts with lichens overgrown,
Grey paling huts that fall and rot
By chimneys built of mud and stone;
The happy bush-rats live and breed
Amid the homes of Bull Dog Lead.
But even in the ruined town
Some few have chosen yet to dwell,
And where the fences tumble down
The former glories they will tell;
Grey, broken miners still will praise
The wonders of the golden days.
If I should ask them why they wait
Among these haunts of what has been,
Unyielding to the tricks of fate
While time runs on and life is lean,
They speak their hope nor count it vain—•
They say, “The mine will come again.”
I never was at Bull Dog Lead,
I cannot tell where it may be,
And yet I think its tracks proceed
O’er inland plains and by the sea,
Wherever ruin softly lays
Its touch on towns of golden days.

Willow Trees.
In the lean greyness of the blacksoil plain.
Where one thin belt of gum-trees marked the
creek,
There was a green oasis in the grey,
Which the long caravans of thought would
seek—
Thoughts of a child with those bright colors
blent
That voice a birth-strain of the Orient.
The weeping willows budding in the Spring—
A mist so delicate and soft and fine,
It seemed to gather in a single night
About those long-lost homestead trees of
mine;
And still, like some green prophet’s veil,
remain
Its floating memories o'er the blacksoil plain.
A barefoot child who caught the trailing
branch
To swing upon, who peeled the willow rods
Until they looked like little naked men—
A witch-spell to some old Arabian gods:
And to and fro on the sheep-rutted track
Lashed willow bales were carried camel back.
The dry grass heaped its yellows down the
fence,
The Bathurst burr encroached with zinc-blue
head ;
And when the stars usurped the open sky,
I heard Romance lead on with ringing tread.
The homely windmill was the Place of Wells ;
And all the night was sweet with camel-bells.
Mirage-spread lakes beyond the ironbarks,
About the wild limp-trees a charmed lagoon.
The winter mists that ribboned on the grass
Made stranger still the strangeness of the
moon;
And stark and bowed to every east-blown
breeze
Shuddered the bareness of the willow-trees.
They seem so woven with those early days.
Far back in memory’s walks I find them still.
The one fair thing in all that dreary plain ;
For my young eyes had never seen a hill.
Their pungent sap seems flooding everything
When autumn listens to 'a bygone Spring.

SUPERANNUATION CONSIDERED AS
A POLITICAL SWINDLE.
A favorite method of buying votes in Aus-
tralia is to start a superannuation fund for
the particular body of Government employees
whose votes are required. At a Federal con-
ference of public servants held a few months
before the last Commonwealth election,
Willis, secretary of the N. S. Wales organ-
isation, laid down the proposition that "pub-
lic servants should sell their votes to the
highest bidder —the man from whom they
can get the most.” About the same time
W. M. Hughes announced in the House of
Representatives that a Superannuation Bill
would have to be passed before Parliament
shut up shop, because “the Commonwealth
public servants have demanded it.” “De-
manded?” exclaimed a Cocky who chanced
to be independent of the public-service vote.
“Hon. members are pedantic this morning,”
was the jocose reply. “That bill will be
passed before Parliament is prorogued.” It
was not only passed but made retroactive
for two years. Nobody comprehended the
Government’s scheme or swindle, least of all,
perhaps, the Minister who introduced it —
his answer to a pertinent request for infor-
mation was, “I haven’t the details with me;
the principle is the same as in the N. S.
Wales Act” —but everybody understood that
the beneficiaries had 25,000 votes and might
influence 50,000 more. And legislators with
doubtful seats were anxious to oblige.
* * *
The measure was not produced until Sep-
tember 19, and Parliament held its last sit-
ting on October 12. December 15 w r as the
date of the general election. Therefore no
perturbation was noticeable when it was
pointed out that official estimates of the cost
to the taxpayers—£22,ooo in the first year,
£115,000 in the fifth, £246,000 in the tenth,
£322,000 in the fifteenth, and so on—were
based on the absurd expectation that the
number of officers affected would remain at
25,000, whereas Commonwealth employees
increased at the rate of 5 p.c. p.a., even in
normal times. Neither was the Government
dissuaded from its purpose of placating
25,000 voters, and hanging the expense, by
the subjoined references (quoted in the
Senate) to the N. S. Wales scheme, on
which, to a large extent, it had modelled
its own:—
The State was induced to enter into the contract
on the grossly mistaken estimate that it would cost
between £190,000 and £200,000 a year. The actual
cost is now £439,000 a year, exclusive of £75,000
paid by corporate bodies. The scheme is objection-
able because it is a privilege given to one class of the
community largely at the expense of another class.
The State’s contribution to one particular pension
is £1052 a year; that of the employee £l3 2s.
a year.
The remarks came from Ley, Minister of
Justice. Since he made them, and since the
Commonwealth proposals were rushed into
being regardless of cost, it has been shown
that he oddly understated the case. A re-
port issued last month by the N. S. Wales
Superannuation Board states that, so far
from the scheme costing the country £439,000
p.a., the contributions due by the State were
£932,964 in 1919-20, £932,075 in 1920-21,
£783,228 in 1921-22 and £691,757 in 1922-
23. Of these sums only £866,077 had been
paid by the Dooley and Fuller Govern-
ments, and on the £2,473,947 owing to the
fund 31 p.c. interest is charged—in fact, “in-
terest on outstanding contributions due by
employers” was calculated at £75,479 last
year. The amounts mentioned were exclusive
of liabilities incurred by 10 “State enter-
prises” (two of which, the trawlers and the
timber-yards, have lately died) and half a
dozen Water Boards and such, which liabili-
ties, when default is made, are chargeable
against the taxes. On June 30 these bodies
owed the fund £71,271. A comparison of
their contributions and the Government’s
with those of the employees is instructive: —
The Public’s The Employees’
Contributions. Contributions.
1919- .. £1,030,536 £162,381
1920- . . 989,810 241,534
1921- . . §14,294 252,358
1922- .. 689,791 250,695
£3,524,431 £906,968
In private institutions which have super-
annuation funds, and in countries where
votes are not the main consideration, the
employer’s subsidy is nearly always pound
for pound. But, votes having been the main
consideration in the Sydney Parliament, the
N. S. Wales taxpayer has been billed for
nearly four times the amount paid in by
those who will exclusively benefit, His
1919-20 contribution amounted to nearly
half of the income-tax revenue collected the
same year. And that was only in respect of
17,000 or 18,000 State employees—l 7,636 was
the number on June 30. The Lord alone knows
how the taxpayer will fare under the Com-
monwealth scheme, with its 25,000 partici-
pants, about 15,000 of whom are in N. S.
Wales, its retroactive benefits and other vote-
catching concessions—even the cost of ad-
ministering it is to come out of Consolidated
Revenue.
* * * *
The N. S. Wales Act was passed in the
fourth session of the War Parliament, in
which the Holman Government changed its
brand from Labor to Nationalist, without
changing its methods. Like the Common-
wealth measure, it permitted employees over
30 years of age to contribute for four units
of pension (£lO4 p.a.) as though they were
only 30. the Government paying the differ-
ence. Another provision opened the door to
political patronage in the distribution of
money from the fund. In this connection, a
remarkable case is quoted by the Auditor-
General. On July 1, 1919, a man in receipt
of £282 p.a. began contributing under the
Superannuation Act for a pension of £156
p.a. In the following month, having paid
£lO 18s. 9d., he was retired on a “break-
down” pension of £156 p.a. Besides his £3
a week he received a gratuity of £146 4s. 5d..
due under the Public Service Acts 1895 and
1920, and a refund of £26 17s. 10d., which
he had paid under the 1884 Act. Here the
Auditor-General takes up the parable:—
The medical certificate under which this officer
retired showed him to be mentally incapable of
performing his duties. Each year since retirement
he has been certified in similar terms. Subsequent
to his retirement he was temporarily employed and
paid by the State as secretary to Mr. Joseph Car-
ruthers. [Joseph is Vice-President of the Execu-
tive Council.] In the Government Gazejtte of
April 6, 1923, the Governor, by proclamation under
the provisions of section 3 of Act 44, 1918, authorised
that he be paid in full the superannuation allowance
during the whole period for which he acted in the
service of the State temporarily as such secretary.
It is a perfectly rotten precedent from the
taxpayer’s standpoint, but a party about to
go to the country and desirous of establishing
light election-time jobs for several hundred
reliable pensioners, may find it useful.
Against properly-framed superannuation
schemes, free from political influence, there
is not a word to be said. But the effect ot
the unutterable N. S. Wales arrangement has
been to set up a privileged class at a mon-
strous expense to the taxpayer, and the same
thing is happening with the Commonwealth
imposition. And the object in each case was
to gain a political advantage for the crowd
in office. The conviction is being forced on
Australians not in politics or Government
employment that they will never get honest
treatment of the public services until they
have segregated the public-service vote.
SUGGESTED ABOLITION OF THE
LOWER HOUSE.
A SIGN of the times is the intense desire of
New Labor to make an end of Upper Houses
in Australia, and particularly of the Fed-
eral Senate. The abolition of the Leg. Coun-
cil has already been accomplished in Queens-
land, and the small amount of fuss which
accompanied the change is rather alarming.
The abolition of the Senate doubtless pre-
seDts more difficulties; but marvels may be
achieved with time and patience and ghost
electors and a ballot-box with a greased and
silent sliding panel.
There is nothing democratic about a heredi-
tary Upper House. There is very little
about one elected on a property franchise,
though a good deal depends on the size of the
qualification. And in practice there are no
redeeming features at all about a House of
unpaid nominees, temporary or life. This
is especially so when, as is the case now in
N. S. Wales, the ruling party puts in none
but men of its own political color (before
the Labor era it was the custom to appoint
an occasional opponent if only for the sake
of appearances), and when they tend more
and more to be individuals without a vestige
of political experience, wholly unknown, too
ignorant in many cases to secure a nomina-
tion even for a Lower House, and, when
they are distinguished at all, only distin-
guished by having a pushful relative or two
in the Assembly. The situation isn’t im-
proved when the rush of applicants for ap-
pointment, many or most of them with no
visible means of support if they get in, be-
comes like the queue outside a free lunch
where drinks are thrown in. It sets people
wondering if there are concealed advantages
of some sort. But an Upper House of the
type of the Federal Senate is essential, even
quite apart from the fact that no one has
shown how the Federal principle can be pre-
served without some such body. The Senate
is almost the only remaining bulwark against
political corruption. Its electorates cannot
be gerrymandered, because the boundaries
are fixed, and they remain as long as the
State remains. It is practically impossible
to seriously influence the result of an elec-
tion by shifting voters from one electorate
to another, and trying to duplicate them as
personal voters in their new haunts and
postal voters in their old ones. That fami-
liar device would require the shifting of too
many voters, and the distances are too great.
Bogus voters may appear on the Senate roll
as well as on any other, but most of the
other profitable tricks of the political game
don’t fit in with the case. The only valid
objection to it is that the constituencies are
very unequal in population. That matter
could be improved on by cutting up some of
the bigger constituencies —in fact, they could
be made almost as equal as the Queensland
State electorates which returned Theodore
and his friends in 1920 —but none of the
complainants show the slightest enthusiasm
for that kind of amendment. It might save
a little money to have only one Federal
House, and if the saving is considered abso-
lutely imperative it might not be a bad idea
to improve the balance of the Senate by a
subdivision of some populous States, and
then let the Representatives slide. More
democratic results might be got that way
than the other.
* * * »
If some Queensland Government of earlier
days had had the foresight to furnish the
State with a salaried Upper House, elected,
like the Senate, by the whole community
acting as one constituency, there would pro-
bably be no Theodore Ministry to-day.
Such an institution would be as democratic
as any Lower House could be, and a great
deal cleaner than some Lower Houses are
liable to be. With local experience and the
example of Queensland in view, the first im-
portant act of the Fuller Government
should have been to turn the N. S. Wales
Legislative Council into such a body, so as
to prevent the next Labor Ministry digging
itself in permanently after the Brisbane
fashion. But the tired Fuller never does
the first important act, or the second one
either. He might also have repaired the
electoral law by which a Government can
buy dissatisfied supporters out of the Assem-
bly with billets and replace them with worse
or more pliable men, thus depriving the elec-
tors of the right to express an opinion—pro-
bably a hostile one-—at by-elections, and
bringing back into the Assembly the nefari-
ous nominee element which N. S. Wales
thought it had left behind in 1856. But with
its vast capacity for forgetting the things
that count, the Fuller Ministry will pro-
bably flicker out without doing anything at
all to prevent its successors taking up the
job of making themselves independent of the
popular will where they left off—really and
solidly independent this time if they have
luck. State Upper Houses like that of Vic-
toria, elected by big constituencies and by
a small Tory constituency of property-
holders, are a defence against Bolshevism,
and they are generally polite in their lan-
guage and free from suspicion of the more
vulgar forms of bribery. But they can’t be
entrusted with much power save that of
obstruction, and they don’t deserve to be.
The State Upper House should be such a
body that it would have at least as good a
claim to survive as the Lower affair if, in
any foolish moment, the people thought of
sacrificing one of them. The only valid (but
unimportant) objection to the Federal
Senate is that the law which gives equal
representation to every State is technically
inequitable. A State Senate would be free
from even that drawback.
* * * *
It is customary to rest in peace and con-
fidence on the assurance that there is no
fear of any junta taking the Australian’s
self-governing rights from him, just as it was
said for long that public insolvency was a
lunatic dream, though now there are doubts
about it. One guarantee is the nation’s
alleged remarkable capacity for self-govern-
ment, though it has argued about making new’
States ever since the British authorities left
it to its own devices, and done nothing.
Another guarantee is the law (this nation is
said to have a marvellous respect for the
law, though its coal-miners and seamen
throw the decisions of the Courts to the
winds, and the Courts wring their hands and
look on), and legalists hold that the law
provides a remedy for every wrong. Unfor-
tunately the very best masses of jurispru-
dence often fail to live up to their reputa-
tion. There seems to be no statutory cure
for a hereditary despot, or a Central Ameri-
can president, or a Lenin or Trotsky, and
there doesn’t even appear to be anything
short of violence, or a very serious threat of
violence, which will give back majority rule
to Queensland in its State capacity. In
short, the dusty old saw holds good that
eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, and
the idea of George Fuller as a sleepless sen-
tinel or a watcher on a tower is a trifle
ridiculous.
PRISONERS’ REFORM.
It is a startling fact that over 40 per cent,
of the inmates of our prisons are virtually
illiterate, while another 40 per cent, have
never received more than a fourth-grade edu-
cation. Assuming, then, as we safely may,
that lack of education is a primary and out-
standing cause of crime, do our present pri-
son systems mitigate or enhance its toxic
power? Will merely locking a man in a
desolate, cramped cell for a given period of
time overcome the cause of his downfall, or
will he return to the world, at the expiration
of his sentence, under even greater handicaps
than before? If the cause is still allowed to
remain, is it not logical to presume that it
will again bring forth effects in a recommis-
sion of crime? And if we permit such a
catastrophe to take place, who is to
blame —the criminal relapsing into crime or
society which has stood idly by and per-
mitted selfish officialdom to bamboozle it by
studiedly misleading statements?
In our prisons there is not enough genuine
employment for half of our prison popula-
tion. Two men are doing one man’s job, and
even then there are hundreds for whom there
is nothing to do. Day in and day out, month
in and month out, during 40 hours in each
week, they sit in idleness deteriorating men-
tally, morally, physically and every other way,
simply awaiting the date set by the Court
for their return to the world at large; and
naturally Judges find the same criminals
coming before them again and again. What
would be our opinion of a business man who
knowingly permitted leakage in his business
to eat up not only the profits, but invested
capital as well? Just as long as we allow
the cause of crime to remain, we must ex-
pect it to bring forth the effect in the recom-
mission of crime; and then we must con-
tinue to foot the bill.
The writer has combed the prison systems
of the world for ideas, and after the most
anxiously searching studies recommends the
adoption of the principles upon which the
correspondence schools conduct the tuition
of their pupils. The Discharged Prisoners’
Aid Association, in every State where it
exists, should cease as such, and register.
itself as a non-profit educational institution.
There should then be a Board of Trustees to
handle the affairs of the Intra-wall Corres-
pondence School. During pre-war days some-
thing of this sort was suggested to Mr. David
Hall, then in charge of the Justice Depart-
ment of N. S. Wales; but presumably the
then reigning penal experts ridiculed the
idea out of court. But ridicule or no, there
are thousands of potential students who
should be encouraged to take such courses;
and the appointment of an inspector of
schools as head of the Victorian Penal De-
partment gives hope that in one State at
least the right thing may be done at last
with these people. Give them the necessary
textbooks, pencils, paper and other require-
ments ; let each receive once a week a set
of questions which he will answer in writing
during the following week. These papers
will be collected, corrected, graded and re-
turned. Most of the work can be done by
prisoner inmates, under the supervision of
the appointed Correspondence School. Each
prisoner might be required to spend at least
two or three hours every evening on the study
he is undertaking. This could be done in the
quiet of the cells, after lock-up hour and
before the lights are extinguished at 9 p.m.
It is a plan of reformation available else-
where. An extract from the Daily Mail
(London) reads:—
A young man who had started on a criminal career
will to-day re-enter the ranks of the workers with
greater attainments for earning an honest living than
when he was committed to prison. He is one of
the first to benefit by the system of teaching installed
in prisons by the correspondence schools. By the
instructions of the Home Office the system is to be
more widely adopted under arrangements.
The young man had served 18 months in
prison. He was a lad of decent family who
was apprenticed for three years as a fitter.
Afterwards he was fitter’s improver for two
and a half years. Then he committed his
fault. This was his story:—
At first I did not care. I did nothing except
routine, and used to occupy spare time in the even-
ings by doing odd jobs “outside,” as we called it —
that is, for the officers and others. I had no inten-
tion of being more than a fitter, and was not inter-
ested in anything for some months.
I was told about the correspondence lessons and
asked to see what they were. The whole arrange-
ment was explained to me, and I thought I would
try if there was anything in it. I said I should
like to learn something that would assist me in my
trade, and the first of the lessons was sent to me.
They began with simple arithmetic —much more
simple than I knew when I left the Board School.
I found the lessons wonderfully interesting, though
I was not good at my books before I came to prison.
I went through a regular course of mechanics and
mechanical drawing, and began to put in as much
as 14 toi 15 hours’ study each week, always at night
when work was done.
I did the exercises sent and had them re-
turned corrected. Everyone was sympathetic, but I
had to do the lessons without assistance —quite by
myself. In all probability I should have learned
none of these things in other circumstances.
Before this I could work to a rough drawing, but
not to scale. Now I can work to scale and make my
own drawings.
Besides giving me instruction, the schools have
found me a job, in which I hope to make a fresh
start. I was taken by one of the officials of the
schools to an employer, and the first question I was
asked was: “Can you work to and read a working
drawing?” Upon saying that I could do so, thanks
to the tuition which 1 have received, I was told I
w'ould be sent for straight away to start work.
This happened in conservative England; and
now in several of the States in America the
correspondence schools are working wonder-
fully well. But in spite of such clearly-
demonstrated good results, here in Australia
we are doing nothing to really improve the
mind of the prisoner.
Considering it only from a pounds,
shillings and pence standpoint, balancing the
cost of maintenance of a convicted felon
against his possible earning capacity if he
were free and making an honest living, this,
constructive work might mean hundreds of
thousands of pounds a year gained. Esti-
mating an average earning capacity of but
£2OO per year, and averaging the cost of
prison maintenance at £SO (not considering
the other branches of law-enforcement and
crime detection), we have a dead loss of
£250 per year whenever a man is gaoled. Are
we doing all we might to save that loss?
Over 10,000 men are to-day incarcerated in
prisons of the Commonwealth. A vast
majority of them are not criminals at heart;
they are simply unfortunates. Whether they

chance to gird themselves witli the mental

further trouble. Australia should not turn
a deaf ear to their entreaties, but make it
possible for them to climb into the sunlight,
where their impulses for a better life will be

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The British Elections.
Two features stand out amid the confusion
of the British elections. One is the moral
certainty that the Protectionist party scored
a victory, whatever bad luck it may have in
collecting the fruits thereof. The other is
that the system by which his Majesty’s Ad-
ministration is supposed to rule and carry
out the will of the majority has come to a
breakdown. His Majesty’s Government will,
of course, struggle on under very bad diffi-
culties so long as there arc men who are
willing to sink principles for the sake of
salary, and no one seems to remember Lloyd
George, for instance, refusing salary. He
even sank his bitter and vituperative feud
with Asquith in the hope of bringing salary
a little nearer. But majority rule appears
to be in for a period of eclipse, and so far
as concerns the one great question on which
the election was fought, Britain seems likely
to be ruled by the smallest minority. It is
an absurd position, but a good many absur-
dities happened in the course of the conflict,
including Lloyd George’s flow of Billings-
gate, and the colored Asiatic Bolshevik can-
didate at Battersea. The most minute and
the most completely licked party among the
three which count is that which stands un-
reservedly for orthodox Freetrade. Yet
orthodox Freetrade may remain indefinitely,
for debris, once it happens to be there, will
stay till further notice unless it is removed.
And though the Protectionist party is
the largest one, it isn’t large enough
to do the moving. In between is
Ramsay Macdonald s Labor party, with
its attachment of Bolsheviks, Commu-
nists, Anarchists or whatever they may be
called. They attach themselves naturally ;
not being strong enough to run alone, and
they howled dovm Liberal and Conservative
candidates impartially. The increasing
strength of this element is suggested by the
fact that it was the liowlingest election in
British history. The Labor party cares very
little what happens to the Dominions, and
pins its faith to a “levy on capital,” which
is really an attempt to collect, say, 10 years'
tax in one year, and then go on collecting
the annual tax as usual. The amount talked
of is three thousand millions, a sum which
no British Laborite would dream of expect-
ing Germany to pay in 30 years, but which
he thinks his own country should find any
day, and without ceasing to meet its ordi-
nary bills. The Labor leader got cold feet
as the election went on, and as the possi-
bility approached that his party might win
and find itself up against its own monster.
So he hedged by saying that if financial
authorities agreed that the levy was impos-
sible it would be abandoned, rather ignor-
ing the fact that financial authorities have de-
clared it impossible all along. As regards
the aim of Prime Minister Baldwin, which
is to recover the British home market for
British-manufactured goods, Labor was rather
indefinite—there are both tariff reformers
and Cobdenites in its ranks. If the former
number even one-third, then the new House
of Commons has a Protectionist majority—
and yet has no chance of getting I rotec-
tion, because the British two-party Respon-
sible-Government machine lias broken down.
The apparatus may get into repair again,
and on the other hand it may not. All that
can be said is that for the moment it does
not look as if the election has done anything
to improve the situation with regard to the
national peril of unemployment. The orthodox
Liberals propose to let it fester, and say
vaguely that there is no god but Cobden, and
that things will come right when peace is
restored, or in Heaven, or some time, or
somewhere. Orthodox Labor proposes to
let things slide also, if it doesn’t make them
worse by selling up at bargain sales many
of the employers who remain, in order to
provide its “capital levy” and reduce the
public debt. The only plan offering—the
simple and well-proved one of recovering the
home market by. shutting strangers out of
it—-belonged to the crowd which has lost its
available majority, so now there is no de-
finite scheme on offer. Baldwin retains his
self-respect, at any rate. He was convinced
that Protection is the cure, so lie tried to
get it. It is better to be the man who tried
and failed than the man who refused to try
anything but another draught of office.
Parliamentarianism in Decay.
Parliaments become a menace when they
begin to function as milch cows for poli-
ticians and political hangers-on, and to legis-
late not in the interests of the general body
but at the dictates of cliques. It is not re-
markable, though extremely ominous, that in
Australia the word “politician” has come to
have an offensive meaning; for here very
much the same conditions prevail as are seri-
ously threatening constitutionalism in Italy.
The crimes committed against the community
are not all overt: some of the worst are
what theologians call sins of omission. In
N. S. Wales a Venereal Diseases Act has been
on the Statute Book for five years. For
two years, on one pretext and another, it
was disregarded. During the past three
years it has been administered in such a way
as not to inconvenience sufferers; in other
words, on lines that render it a farce. This
is because politicians fear the V.D. vote —
which is understandable on the figures. It
has been calculated that 15 per cent, of the
entire population of the Commonwealth,
men, women and children, are sufferers from
V.D. in one form or another; and since V.D.
is essentially an adult’s disease, the propor-
tion of victims of a voting age is very large.
Last month Chief Secretary Oakes went so
far as to promise, not that he would enforce
the letter and spirit of the Act, as is done in
the case of measures which are unobjection-
able to influential sections, but that he
would ask Parliament to double the sub-
sidy to clinics —£5000. There is to be no
inevitable notification in every case; but
£lO,OOO a year may be spent in the effort to
cure the diseases after, owing to the absence
of measures which have almost wiped out
small-pox, typhoid, etc., the horrors have been
contracted. This annual sum, which is to
be expended on the upkeep of clinics, if 1 ar-
liament is agreeable, is about what an im-
ported Governor, his staff and perquisites
cost the State every year. Nobody outside
a limited circle wants an imported State
Governor. He is the only _ highly-paid
official whose absence from his post for
months or years places no serious _ burden
on a substitute and makes no difference
whatever to the daily life of the average tax-
payer. The “Government House vote is
nothing for numbers, but it is a whale for
wealth, and the Party Government does not
exist that can afford to ignore it. Pecula-
tion is either ignored by Governments, or dis-
counted by Royal Commissions which have
to find on such remnants of evidence as the
parties implicated have decided to leave un-
destroyed. Indeed, in whatever direction the
masses who are paying for Parliaments look
they find a disregard for the interests of the
State and a slavish concern for the approval
of organised sections. It is Parliamentar-
ianism in decay, afad unless the trouble can
be checked events in Europe indicate what
the «nd will be.

Keeping the Doctor Busy.
“It is not the medical profession that is chiefly
to blame because disease is not prevented. It is
the public, individually and collectively, that is
mostlv at fault. Members of the profession are cease ;
lessly striving to educate the public as to the supreme
importance of health and as to the proper measures
necessary for maintaining good- and avoiding ill-health.
The members of the public cannot be persuaded tor
their own good to adopt these measures, even when
most obvious. — President's address at the last Medical
Congress.
Most honest laymen will admit the
truth of this indictment. It is at the root
of the superstition that the tropics are un-
healthy. Any inhabited place will become
unhealthy without prophylactic measures to
make it sanitary, just as the human body be-
comes unhealthy unless washed, lime was
when an appointment in certain tropical re-
gions was equivalent to a death sentence.
Quarter of a century ago Ronald Ross de-
monstrated that malaria could be prevented
by the eradication of mosquitoes, and imme-
diately the incidence of this disease was mini-
mised wherever people troubled to take pre-
cautionary measures. Hookworm and yellow
fever have been almost wiped out in the south-
ern States of America by the agency of pro-
phylactic campaigns subsidised by the Rock-
feller Institute. Cholera, dysentery, plague,
typhoid and other filth diseases have been
checked, or wholly abolished, wherever the
inhabitants of areas afflicted by tb en L have
realised the uses of pure water and efficient
sanitary services, and acted accordingly.
Australia has tropical districts in which the
death-rate is lower than England’s 13 per
thousand, while the infantile mortality rate
is well below the Cold Land’s 77 per thou-
sand. On the other hand there are white
communities which starkly refuse to be clean.
When the Germans invaded Poland they
aroused more hatred by installing modern
water supplies and urging sanitary methods
on the inhabitants than by any other form
of tyranny. Dirtiness had become a conven-
tion with the Poles, as it is with the people
of Europe’s “cholera belt,” which traverses
some of the coldest parts of Europe. We
raise our hands in smug disapproval of the
ignorant contrariness of these degenerates
who, though offered by science the opportu-
nity to disinfect themselves, prefer to re-
main polluted, an agony to themselves and a
menace to the cleanly outside world. And
yet it is merely a question of fashions in
filth. Three or four decades ago Melbourne
was periodically ravaged by typhoid, which
is one of the diseases that Eastern Europe
disregards. Action was decided upon, and
the death-rate from typhoid is now down to
8.5 per thousand of the population. As
against this more than one person in every
eight is suffering from one or other of the
venereal diseases which, while incomparably
more revolting and injurious to the national
well-being than typhoid, are a good deal
easier to eradicate, given the requisite cour-
age and resolution. The medical profession
is in a position to present any Parliament in
Australia with recipes for the prevention of
half the ills that distress our people. Our
Parliamentarians, however, are very like the
Poles in the presence of the scientists of
Germany. They would rather suffer and
die in the pollution to which they are accus-
tomed than go to the trouble and expense of
cleaning it up.
Criminal Law Amendment.
From an old practitioner:—
Apropos N.S.W. Attorney-General Bavin’s Crimes
Amendment Bill, I think I may safely affirm that
there is a practically universal belief in British com-
munities in favor of trial by jury in criminal cases;
so much so, in fact, that any attempt or proposal
to abolish that system in favor of trial by Judges or
magistrates has always evoked the strongest opposition,
and has never met with any measure of success. My
observations, it may be observed, bear only upon
criminal or quasi-criminal cases, and do not embrace
civil matters.
Mr. Bavin disclaims the idea of any attack upon
the principle of trial by jury, and asserts that it is
a mistake to suppose that he is solely responsible
for the proposed measure, as it was prepared by
sound and capable lawyers with wide criminal experi-
ence long before he came into office. Admitting this,
the fact that any legislation abrogating trial by jury
either wholly or partially —any attack, in short, upon
the principle —has been initiated by or has obtained
the approval of “sound and capable lawyers” seems
to me to be anything but a convincing argument in
favor of the bill. Lawyers are entitled to great
respect as regards questions falling within their pro-
fessional province; but it is open to serious doubt
whether they are safe guides in matters of public
policy, though their aid in shaping the form in
which that policy is to be given effect to cannot but
be valuable. Anyhow, Mr. Bavin cannot take refuge
behind somebody else: it is he who must accept the
full responsibility for this attempt to tamper with
what in the general belief is a basic principle.
Is it or is it not a fact that, as the
law stands now, in all cases of larceny an
accused person may insist upon being tried by
a. jury irrespective of the amount involved? And
does the proposed Act in any way alter or modify
this position? Let Mr. Bavin answer that. However
small the amount, it has to be remembered that
“character” as well as “property” may be at stake
in many instances.
Mr. Bavin also justifies the clause enabling a
Judge to comment on the fact of an accused person
refraining ’from giving evidencei; he says this
amendment was inserted by men of long and intimate
acquaintance with the criminal law, and that it
brings our law into harmony with British law. But
why this harmony, seeing that our restrictive clause
was clearly intended to destroy that harmony ? Has
there been any public demand for a return to the old
law? Personally I see no objection to comment by a
Judge, but that is beside the question, which is
whether the proposed restoration is actuated by any
public demand or sentiment for the abolition of a
law deliberately placed on the Statute Book at the
apparent desire of the electors. I suggest that before
such an Act as the one in question is passed, the
provisions should be brought by the Government
fully before the public through the public prints,
so as to avoid the possibility of such an important
matter being, as it were, slipped through without
due consideration for the want of publicity.

Ireland and the Fiscal Issue.
“Mr. T. P. O’Connor, as president of the Irish
Democratic League, has issued an address to Irish
electors in Great Britain. In this he points out that
it is the first election in which they have been able
to record votes on purely British issues. He strongly
advises them to vote against Protection, which he
declares to be against the principles, traditions and
interests of the Irish race.” — -Reuter.
As an example of the effrontery of party poli-
ticians this ranks with Lloyd George’s \ v, ecent
denunciations of the Protectionist principles
which he put into practice when he was in
power. The whole Irish grievance against
England for at least three centuries was
based on the latter’s selfish denial to Ireland
of the right to build up her own industries;
and none was more vocal on the subject than
T. P. O’Connor in the days when he lived
politically on the wrongs done to his native
land. The Commercial Restraints of the
17th century prevented Ireland exporting
anything to* the American plantations .but
linen and foodstuffs. This was the germ of
the emigration movement to America, and the
chief cause of the Hibernians’ bitterness
against the Sassenach. A nation which is
forbidden to export five-sixths of the goods
it is producing exports men; and the men
thus exiled depart in no pleasant frame of
mind. The Penal Laws which followed
were not religious so much as commercial —
a point T. P. O’Connor’s Protestant leader
Parnell was never tired of making. They
were directed chiefly at the Irish woollen
industry (like the linen industy, almost
entirely Protestant), and, in Lord Dur-
eerin’s phrase, delivered this prosperous busi-
ness “gagged and bound into the hands of
the London merchants.” For a couple of
decades after the abolition of the Corn Laws,
Irishmen emigrated at the rate of 100,000 a
year, and found employment in the protected
industries of the U.S.A., as an alternative
to starving at home. So far from Protection
being against the “principles, tradition and
interests of the Irish race’’ in modern times,
the end of the seven-century struggle between
Ireland and her neighbor to the east was
held up, in the last stages, by but one issue
—fiscalism. The first Convention failed
because the British Government was deter-
mined to retain control of Customs and
Excise, and the Irish delegates were unyield-
ing on the point that nothing mattered so
much to Ireland, nationally, as the power to
impose a protective tariff.

A Port That Was.
No paper in its normal frame of mind is
more strongly attached to the doctrine of
bringing all N. S. Wales and as much as pos-
sible of the rest of Australia to Sydney than
the Daily Telegraph, but it is difficult to be
normal all the time. It was more
honest than normal on November 30, when
it published the story of Twofold Bay, the
neglected and almost abandoned sea-outlet of
the southern end of the Ma State and of
eastern Victoria. Twofold Bay is the de-
serted port of an almost deserted province—
a place with a considerable past but no pros-
pect of a future until the capital gets off its
chest. To quote some of the Telegraph’s
description
In Twofold Bay the State has a port that is only
rivalled in all Australia by Port Jackson. And for
all the attempt that has been made by any Govern-
ment to use it as a factor in the development of
that corner of the State it might as well have never
existed.... As far back as 1833 the Administration
of the colony evidently considered Twofold Bay had
a future... 1 Accordingly the site of the town of
Eden on the N.-E. side of the harbor was surveyed. . . .
The Government in 1843 made a grant of 1500
acres of land on the foreshores, from the south
head to the western side of the bay, to Ben Boyd,
about whose life and work a good deal of romance
have been woven. .. . With the backing of English
capital he built Boyd Town, established a boiling-
down and other works complementary to his pastoral
operations on Monaro, and opened up direct shipping
with Tasmania, New Zealand and London. .. .
In the “Gazetteer of Australia,” published in 1848
by W. H. Wells, the convenience, capacity and
safety of the anchorage at Twofold Bay are extolled,
and it is remarked: “Boyd Town, though but lately
founded, is already a flourishing seaport, enjoying
a commerce of considerable importance, being the
port of outlet for the south-eastern districts of
N.S.W. and key to the vast Monaro country....
a rapid metamorphosis from the wild bush to the
bustling seaport town”
There is nothing of the bustling seaport town
about the bay to-day. Except for a few ruins all
traces of Ben Boyd’s enterprises have disappeared.
....The Tasmanian and Melbourne steamers that
used to call regularly at Eden have not returned
since the war, and one small coastal steamer weekly
now lifts the trade of the port, apart from an
occasional timber ketch.
In pre-railway days one harbor with a road
leading to it "was the same as any similar
harbor with a road leading to it, and many
places like Eden and Boyd Town, as they
used to be—places that have relapsed into
oblivion —threatened to develop. Then rail-
ways became essentials of progress, and the
seaport without a line was like a warehouse
without a telephone. But except as regards
Sydney and regions dependent on it, the pur-
pose of railway construction in N. S. Wales
has been to hinder progress rather than to
help it. As an instance, the line (320 miles
long) from Sydney stops 60 miles short of
Twofold Bay lest trade should go there and
the prosperous times of 1848 come back. The
State loses as much as £117,400 in a year
by stopping the line at an inland village
instead of at a “bustling seaport town,”
but in N. S. Wales a loss like that
is considered well made if it blights a
town. The other day Ashton, M.L.C.,
had an inspiration. He said that N. S.
Wales is borrowing too much, which is obvi-
ous to the naked eye. He proposed, there-
fore, that the works now partly finished, such
as the long dry track to Broken Hill, should
be pushed to completion, after which there
should be a long halt. Yet it seems almost
worth while to get out of the rut and try to
revive that vision of Twofold Bay as it was
in 1848. There are no such visions on the 355
solemn miles between Condobolin and Broken
Hill.
■
Defying Nature.
“Singemoine” muses on the absurdity of
grafting figs on thistles: —
The Rev. S. J. Hoban, of Melbourne Central Mis-
sion, observed in the Angus last week: “Since 6
o’clock closing of hotels had been in force, thousands
of young men had been deprived of the only club
they had known—the public-house. Consequently
they now wandered the city like lost sheep, hanging
around street-corners with nothing to do.” Man is
inescapably gregarious, more particularly when
young, and if legislatively deprived of the oppor-
tunity to be convivial in company during his spare
time, he will in many cases do worse than hang round
street-corners. The inn, designed for the mental
and physical refreshment of resting toilers, has
existed since the earliest days of recorded history,
and its sudden abolition during those hours when
it is most needed by the class that needs it most
is bound to have undesirable reactions. In the
more Sabbatarian parts of England-—meaning chiefly
those country districts and towns in which there is
no amusement whatever to be had on Sundays—it
is beginning to be noticed that the Day is not one
of Rest so much as of Crime. The Recorder of
Salford Hundred recently commented on this develop-
ment in his charge to a grand jury as follows:
This is the day when young people have more time
on their hands than they know how to dispose of
wisely, I think. On looking at these facts you will
be as convinced as 1 am that this question ought to
be gone into very thoroughly by the responsible autho
ritiefe.
The aimless and dreary idleness imposed by the Puri-
tan Sunday is, of course, the most mentally enervat,
ing of all. Nature never intended man to stagnate
completely for one day in seven; and, indeed, it is
a poor type of adult that can rest either physically
or intellectually for so long.
But there is another variety of compulsory loaf
which has no basis in religion, and which is rapidly
growing on this country—the statutory public holi-
day. Its authors assume human beings to be what
they never have been since they began to \year
clothes, namely, creatures of leisure. A glut of holi-
days gives few any happiness, while to the majority
it brings boredom and the detrimental practices
that follow in boredom’s train.
America was getting along nicely as regards tem-
perance when the Volstead Amendment arrived. In
1914 Americans drank only half as much beer and
spirits per head as' they had consumed in 1894, The
present alcohol consumption figures are natural!}'
hard to come by, but even prohibitionists agree that
a colossal quantity of liquor is being made and im-
ported, and that thousands are now imbibing freely
who never thought of strong drink in pre-prohibition
days. A directly opposite state of affairs is to be
seen in Britain :
If the brewers had in 1922 brewed at the 1892
rate per head of the population, they would have
brewed 36,000,000 barrels; in fact, they brewed
21,000,000. If the people in England and Wales
had consumed in 1922 spii’its at the 1892 rate they
would have drunk 24,500,000 gallons; in fact, they
drank 12,000,000 gallons.
In other words, you can lead Nature, but she won’t
be driven.

The Importance of Quality in Babies.
The logic of facts must compel the oppo-
nents of birth-control to admit that quality
of children is of much greater importance
than mere quantity. Biological research has
of late thrown light upon one of the most
puzzling enigmas of history, namely, _ the
causes of the rise and fall of great civilisa-
tions. It is a shallow view that attributes
the decline of the Roman Empire, for in-
stance, to the luxurious habits of the em-
perors and patricians and their yielding to
the demands of the demagogic plebs for un-
limited free bread and circuses. The reason
for these habits and demands themselves
must be sought. Lothrop Stoddart, Wil-
liam McDougal and others have shown
that the burden of any civilisation is borne
by a comparatively small proportion of the
people composing it, and if this proportion
falls too low the civilisation is toppled over
by its own weight. Our modern civilisation is
more complex than any that has ever pre-
ceded it, and the strain of supporting it is
correspondingly greater. Yet when we
analyse the general birth-rate we find that
it is greatest among the lowest classes and
dangerously low among those who must re-
produce in sufficient numbers if our society
is not to fall. It has been estimated, for
■example, that 1000 Harvard graduates will
leave only 50 descendants in 200 years time
if the present birth-rate among them con-
tinues, while the same number of the riff-
raff of Eastern Europe in America will leave
200,000. One of the chief causes of this
sterilisation of the fit (due to late marriages
and restricted families among them) is the
economic burden placed upon the community
by the necessity it is under of supporting
the unfit in gaols, mental hospitals, etc. In
Victoria, for instance, £300,000 is annually
expended on the maintenance of 4000 certi-'

fied insane people. Besides actual lunatics
there is an appallingly large number of
people in a greater or less degree mentally
deficient. Many of these can never become
more than hewers of wood and drawers of
water, even under the best circumstances of

quite unable to look after themselves or to
refrain from anti-social acts. These people

brain, and Professor Berry, of Melbourne,
anil others, have recently shown that these
unfortunates have a much smaller number
of these cells than normal individuals, and
thus approach the condition of animals,
which entirely lack them. Mental degener-
ates practically always produce children as
bad or worse than themselves, and through
their inherited improvidence and lack of
responsibility and control are extremely pro-
lific. It has been estimated that there are
30,000 mental defectives in Australia.
Humanity demands that they shall be
enabled to live as happy lives as possible, but
eommonsense also insists that they shall
most strictly be prevented from handing on
their defects to posterity. During the next
few years a great many of those of school
age will be detected by the education authori-
ties. _ It is an urgent duty of the State to
provide means for their segregation. In
America institutions like the Pennsylvania
Village for Feeble-minded Women, which is
self supporting, are doing excellent work in
this direction. After suitable training and
under careful supervision many of these
defectives can be allowed to return to the
general community if suitable positions that
do not entail too great a strain on their
limited powers can be found for them, and
if the community can be guaranteed against
the propagation of more unfit. Excessive
sentiment has caused disaster in the past;
it is only right that science should be given
an opportunity to retrieve it in the future.
The latter has already demonstrated its
ability to improve the strain of different
animals by preventing scrubs from breeding.
Surely the production of citizens is of at
least equal importance.
Party Rule in Britain.
The party system is the most effective device
yet discovered for getting small things done
—especially small things that will irritate
some section—-and ensuring that the big
necessary things shall remain undone.
Clearly there is something wrong in Britain,
which is paying doles to over a million un-
employed and is imploring its young people
to emigrate. Conservatives to the number
of 259 in the newly-elected Parliament say
Freetrade is the trouble, but opposed to them
are 342 Laborites, Liberals and Independ-
ents. The Laborites set great value on a
capital levy, and on this point they are
opposed by most of the Liberals and all the
Conservatives. The Liberals believe in the
laissez-faire policy that has brought their
country to its present dreadful pass, and in
particular they have a MicAWBER-like faith
m the League of Nations. An arrangement
which ensured the maintenance of the
status quo, or disturbed it only in some
trifling respect, was well enough while the
United Kingdom was the world’s financial
centre, in undisputed command of the seas,
and not hampered with an unwieldy national
debt. But the times now call for action,
Britain being in the situation of an old busi-
ness firm that finds itself losing custom
wholesale to upstart rivals. Italy and Spain,
faced with a similar problem, went for dic-
tators, and the French have had one, to all
intents and purposes, since Clemengeau
imposed his will on the Deputies during the
war. It looks as though Britain, if it is to
get the bold, logical policy necessary for its
salvation, may have to follow suit. But
dictators do not last in any white country;
and their reigns have been' notably short in
freedom-loving England. So that the revolu-
tion which produces the dictator (if it
comes) will only be the forerunner of
another one designed to depose him. After
which the struggle to constitutionalism and
democracy will begin again. All this might
be obviated by the abolition of partyism—
by an admission on the part of all the
warring caves in the House that none of
them has a recipe for the Millennium, and
an agreement to compromise for the good of
the Empire on that basis. But the party
popes meet every suggestion of the sort with
threats of excommunication, which when put
into force means political ruin as complete as
the rum following on an ecclesiastical ban
in the Dark Ages.

Richard Arthur, M.L.A., writes:—
We are agitating- ourselves vastly over the fate
of the Australia. Shall she he sunk at sea, or
handed over to the knackers and souvenir-hunters, or
rest ingloriously as part of a breakwater? Fools
and blind ! What concern of oure is it wlhat becomes of
the old hulk? She did bravely in her day, but
that is of the past. Our concern now should be:
What shall take her place? We are acting as if
we lived in a planet of our own, or as if the
renown of the Anzacs would suffice to shock the
world in arms. Land defence, coastal defence, sea
defence, all are in a state of chaos. We learn
nothing and forget everything that history teaches
of the inevitable lot of the rich, defenceless peoples.
It. is only a matter of time, and as sure as the
sun rises, so surely do the lamb nations go down
before their wolf neighbors. But the virus of bastard
sport has so infected the youthful voters of the
Commonwealth that its nominal rulers dare not call
them away from the racecourse to the training-camp
for more than a few days.

Mark B. Young’s rejoinder to H. Vaughan :
The comments of Mr. Vaughan, F.I.A. (B. 6/12/’23),
indicate that he has entangled himself in a maze
of his own construction. How could anyone fall into
the error of regarding an English note and an Aus-
tralian note as being the same any more than one
could regard Bill .Jones’s cheque as being the same
as that of Tom Smith? One may be just as good
as the other, but one is the obligation of Jones and
the other of Smith. There is no common or joint
responsibility anj- more than in the case of the
notes of the Commonwealth and the notes of the
Bank of England or of the British Treasury. Mr.
\ auqhan sapientiy remarks: “Australian pounds
IN TATTSMANIA.
“The Tasmanian Premier [Mr. Lyons] has interviewed the Acting-Prime Minister [Dr. Page] asking
for a special grant of £115,000 per year to enable the State to meet its commitments. If he could get
this fr om the Commonwealth he would have no hesitation in asking the Tasmanian taxpayer to make
a further effort."
LYONS, THE URGER: “ Look ’ere, boss, I’m broke to the wide. But I could make a
recovery on Taxpayer if you’d spring me a few bob to encourage his owner.”
could not be at a discount if they could be freely
converted into gold and the gold freely exported.”
Quite so! And while the tap is nor, turned off
water will flow, provided any remains in the tank.
There’s the rub! How much free gold would remain
while the foreign exchange continues in a depreciated
condition? A merchant wishing to settle an account
in America can buy no more than $4.36, payable in
New York, for his pound. If gold were free he
could get one sovereign for every pound-note, and,
with the coin secure $4.86 in New York, and thus
reap an advantage of 50 cents to the £,
or, roughly, 2s. 3d. in the pound, or say,
11* p.c. While London exchange with New York
is below par, we cannot avoid the effect; for, after
all, London is still our chief point of settlement. It
is idle for Mr. Vaughan to postulate that “if Aus-
tralia were to remove the embargo on gold export
to-morrow, and allow gold to circulate freely, Eng-
land remaining with its pound depreciated, as at
present, then of course our pound would become a
real pound, and would exchange for more than a
pound in London.” While we import more from
U.S.A. than we export to that country—while our
trade balance generally remains adverse, and while
our annual commitments to the holders in the.
I nited Kingdom of Australian bonds are so great—
the favored position pictured is not likely to
materialise. When currencies are rectified, exchanges
will be found to right themselves. The United
States holds the key to the position, as a result of
the benefits derived from the great war to “make
the world secure for democracy,” and when she faces
her share of the cost involved, the first great move-
ment towards evoking order out of disorder will
have been made.
“Country Med" : The Crown insists upon its
right to drag medical witnesses any distance
from their jobs to give evidence as to mat-
ters_ of fact in criminal cases —evidence often
trivial, and which has mostly been already
tendered in the lower court before, the com-
mittal of an accused. The remuneration
allowed is, in at least two States, one guinea
per diem, which barely covers hotel expenses
and cannot provide for the engagement of a
locum. About a year ago I was summoned
to Cloncurry (N.Q.), 176 miles from where
I was practising, to give evidence in a mur-
der trial. The date fixed for the hearing,
and the gradualness of the local train ser-
vice, entailed my absence for nearly a week.
My quid pro quo was something under £6,
plus a first-class railway pass. The engage-
men of a locum from Brisbane, the nearest
centre that could supply one, would have cost
me £4O. Yet I had to leave a hospital full
of patients, and a few expectant mothers, to
do the best they could without me. The
nearest resident practitioner was at Huglien-
den. 76 miles away. And all I was required
to do at Cloncurry was to make oath and
say that I saw the man dead, and had sub-
sequently post-mortemed the body and ex-
tracted sundry shot from his heart—all of
which facts I had already sworn to at the
Magistrate’s Court. Only the other day I
had to go to a N. S. Wales country town
on another murder case, leaving my hospital
and practice, to give two minutes’ evidence,
solely a matter of repetition. Isn't it pos-
sible for the parties to agree to accept the
lower-court evidence of the doctor? If that
isn't, possible, then, in the interests of the
public, the doctor should be at least provided
with a locum.
“ Clifford Snook” : Archbishop Mannix,
whose craving to tell Australia all about the
squabbles of a small island off the Scottish
coast amounts to a permanent engagement,
broke old ground the other day at a mass
meeting held in a Melbourne circus. The object
was to protest against the conduct of some
Irishmen in the Irish Free State who are keep-
ing other Irishmen in gaol. It seems a purely
domestic matter, and not likely to be affected
by remarks made at this distance, and as
there isn’t the slightest prospect of raising
an Australian loan in the Free State we
don’t appear to come in anywhere. What
the good Archbishop sought to explain was
that the British Government, over which we
have no control (more especially as we owe
it £90,388,604 for the pay and main-
tenance of our troops), is the sole obstacle to
peace and contentment in the Free State, and
that a republican Ireland would be as tran-
quil as Gregory McGirr, who proposes to
make a most dreadful exposure of his late
(and mostly Irish) colleagues in the N. S.
Wales Ministry, or James Dooley, on the
warpath after “uncouth crooks.” Mean-
while militant Erin, despite its peaceful
ways, made quite a brisk show at the recent
British elections, and the two semi-Irish
cities of Liverpool and Glasgow were storm
centres —especially Glasgow, which is the
hub of an Irish population of some 400,000.
It was there that a lady candidate in the
Liberal interest was trodden and expec-
torated on by her audience —not a Tory
female, but a Freetrader who wanted to keep
British ports open to Irish goods, and who
stood for the party which first put Irish
Home Rule on a British Government pro-
gramme. Personally I believe the Irish re-
public will come so far as the Free State
territory is concerned. Then archbishops
arriving from that part of Ireland will be
aliens, and we shall be able to speak to them
effectively if they try to stir up trouble in
Australia because of some grievances they
think they suffer from in their own foreign
land.

‘‘[ford'’: “Singemoine” insists in effect (B.
6/12/'23) that all the teachings of history and
the hard logic of fact go to show that it is
as impossible for a Frenchman to misunder-
stand German character as it is for the
English to understand the Irish. “The
average Frenchman,” he assures us, “lias a
natural eye for a German, as some people
have for a horse.” Isn’t the parallel more
than a little damaging to the contention it
seeks to illustrate? Did “Singemoine” ever
know a man brought up from childhood to
distrust and detest horses who nevertheless
possessed an unerring eye for anything and
everything equine, and whose judgment he
himself was ready to accept unquestioningly
about the points of any horse?
By an old union secretary:—
Not long ago some of the parties to the One Big
Union arrangement were quarrelling so vigorously
that it looked as if the thing would be dropped.
But peacemakers got busy to such purpose that an
application for registration has been lodged with the
Commonwealth Arbitration Court. If the scheme
goes through it will bring into a single federated
body the A.W.U. (which has already swallowed the
Railway Construction Workers’ Unon and other big
organisations), the Workers’ Industrial Unions (prin-
cipally coal-miners) and the Waterside Workers.
This federated body will be at the back of any sec-
tion which thinks it has a grievance worth striking
about. Some of the craft unions are as much con-
cerned about the new development as the Employers’
Federation. There have already been clashes between
craft unions and industrial organisations as to which
should collect the fees of “crafties” working along-
side pick-and-shovel men and the like. The crafts-
man, as a rule, prefers his craft union. For one
thing, he objects to the growth of bureaucratic ten-
dencies amongst big industrial unions, like the
A.W.U., in which it is an offence to criticise, and
the same old “click” keeps office year after year,
lie realises, moreover, that should he become merged
in a mob of militant industrialists, his chance of
securing recognition of the principle of “a margin
for skill” will grow small by degrees and unbeauti-
fully less. Nor is opposition to these sinister Federa-
tions confined to the “crafties.” A few weeks ago
the Fremantle wharf-laborers were commanded by
wire from Sydney to stop work for 24 hours on
account of some trumpery dispute in Walsh Bay or
thereabouts. In other years they obeyed such orders
without asking the reason why, but on this occasion
they decided to go on working. Similarly, many
Queensland coal-miners sullenly objected to being
levied on, to the extent of £9OOO or £lO,OOO, for
the support of the last senseless Maitland strike, and
a breakaway movement is now in progress. The
fact is that members of distant branches are ruth-
lessly sacrificed to the caprices of “head office” or
the organisation nearest the heart of things, and if
the 0.8. U. is to prosper its founders will have to
overcome this feeling. And it will be a tough con-
tract.

POLITICAL
POINTS
From the Australian angle:—
In November, 1922, Britain gave the Conservatives
a majority of 79 over all other parties and groups.
The majority vanished last week and with it the
prospect of “tranquillity” in domestic and foreign
affairs, which “tranquillity” was promised by the
late Bonar Law. Though still the strongest of the
three parties, the Conservatives have lost about
80 seats, including those of several Ministers. They
will be unable to govern except by grace of the
Liberals, and that means another election at an
early date or another coalition —it isn’t quite 14
months since they retired, fed up, from the last
coalition- —with the abandonment of Conservative
policies in either case. Rather than accept office
with humiliation they may step down in favor of a
stop-gap Labor or Lloyd George Ministry, and con-
centrate on educating the constituencies up to their
programme of fiscal reform. Meantime, Australia had
better make up its mind that there will be no
preferential duties, on the Baldwin scale at least.
Moreover, if the Labor party secures a majority for
its capital levy at the next appeal to the country,
which can’t be far off, there will be no more London
loans.
Having failed to be just when justice was
demanded of it, the Vic. Lawson Government
lias decided to be generous in its belated
scheme of police pensions—so generous that
the non-superannuation men who held on
when the strike occurred can hardly believe
it is real. At 55 an ordinary .T. Hop with
30 years’ service will be able to draw just
on £4 a week pension. Provision for pay-
ments in case of injury and for all-round
benefits is more lavish than was ever anti-
cipated. The contribution is fixed at 24 p.c.
of pay, and thus the State will carry the bulk
of the burden. Moreover, pay and allow-
ances have been raised to such an extent that
it will be possible for a man of special merit
to reach £346 at the end of nine years.
Policemen who joined the force since 1902.
and who stood loyal during the strike, will
not have to pay contributions in respect of
the time they have already served. The
measure will be whisked through this week.
The Civic Reformers in Sydney City Coun-
cil and the Nationalists in N.S.W. Assem-
bly owed their success to an uprising of
public opinion against Tammany bossism.
Each crowd has made the poorest use of a
first-class opportunity, and both are head-
ing for disaster. For upwards of a year the
municipal “Reformers” have been split into
two camps, the smaller of which has now
joined with the Labor aldermen to re-elect
Gilpin as Mayor, while the larger group
hates Gilpin so cordially that it would have
voted in preference for a Labor candidate
had one been nominated. As for the Par-
liamentary Nationalists, they have drifted
into the fatuous habit of thinking that Ne
Temere and Liquor Referendum Bills and
dull attacks on the Labor party are all that
is necessary to secure their return to power.
They will be horribly undeceived.
Queensland newspapers have been making
a great to-do about the completion of the
coastal line from Brisbane to Townsville,
but nothing was said about the railways pay-
ing £1 9s. p.c. last year, against an interest
charge of £4 6s. p.c. However, there is an
uncompleted link which might conceivably
pay 10 p.c., and which would certainly have
saved Queensland millions in drought-time,
and that is Winton-Longreach. It has been
recommended by all the Railway Commis-
sioners for the last 20 years, but there are
no votes hanging to it, the district being
Labor, railway or no railway. A little is
being done, it is true, but while there is a
rush to build coastal lines that earn hardly
more than axle-grease, the most important
connection in Theodore’s country crawls on
inch by inch.
The story wanders round like an uneasy
ghost that the Hun never surrendered half
his stock of rifles, that the Hun small-arms
factories are working hard but surrepti-
tiously, that recruits are trained almost the
same as of yore but without any the old
swagger, and that Ivrupp is now Krupping
in Russia instead of at the old address. It
is worth while to remember that Napoleon
conquered Prussia in 1806, occupied it, dis-
armed it, limited its armaments and per-
vaded the country for years as if it was his
own property. And in 1814 the astute native
turned up with a new army which Napoleon
hadn’t noticed.
Tasmania makes its application for Fed-
eral aid on the simple and logical ground
that it may burst if the aid isn’t forth-
coming, and that bursting would be bad for
Australia. The new taxation, says Premier
Lyons, will make Tassy the most heavily
taxed of the States bar Queensland, which
is in a category by itself. Apart from taxes,
the average land revenue of the six States
in 1922 was 17s. sd. per inhabitant. Tas-
mania enjoyed less than half the average
(Bs. sd. per head), while Queensland col-
lected more than twice the average (40s.
3d. per head). The island State consists too
much of scenery. The Commonwealth tariff
reduced its revenue badly. Every shipping-
strike isolates it. The Navigation Act
hasn’t helped it. And it wasn’t presented
with a railway as Westralia was. It is the
first of the States to speak frankly about
possible insolvency, but it won’t be the last.
THE MINORITY BIRD.
“The N S.W. Premier continues to throw measures overboard in order to placate doubtful supporters
and declared enemies.”
THE BURD: “ Help yourselves to my feathers —I don't mind ’s tony as you leave me enough
to flutter into recess with."
N.S.W.’s nominated and unpaid Upper
House has decided to appoint a committee
to plan for its reform. Doubtless it is a
matter of etiquette or some other polite old
substance to let the Council take on the work
of extinguishing the old order to which its
members owe their greatness (if any), just
as it would have been in good taste to have
let Charles I. behead himself; but the re-
sult promises poorly. The M’s.L.C. haven’t
even the interest in the improvement of their
Chamber that the British Peers have. Some
of the Peers are young and ardent;
no M.L.C. is in the first flush of
youth, and few are even in the first
flush of middle-age. A Peer is allowed
to be brilliant and ambitious as well
as young, and may be in the House of
Lords merely because his birth shuts him
out of the Commons. Brilliant men don’t
go into the. flavorless and unhonored M.L.C.
trade except in very rare instances, and then
they only do it when they are getting past
ambition. The making of a useful, durable
and democratic Upper House is a job for
statesmen, and the old Upper Housers aren’t'
statesmen. If they were they wouldn’t be
where they are.
Victoria proposes to follow N.S.W.’s dis-
reputable example and charge new schools
and the repair of old ones to loans. The
Education Department will borrow £600,000
to begin with. It may also be deemed neces-
sary to raise a loan for the Police Depart-
ment, for many country stations are so dila-
pidated that the bobby is falling through the
roof. In 1918 Victoria took on the pose of
“the most lightly-taxed State” which pre-
viously belonged to Westralia, and it could
raise another million a year and still be the
second most-lightly-taxed. But the pawning
habit is so much easier.
The patient Victorian authorities got
annoyed the other day, and actually removed
an honorary justice from the J.P. list. One
of the powers of a Vic. J.P. is to accept, bail,
and strange people cab it to his house at all
hours, and ask him to come down to the
lock-up and see them sign a document by
which they pledge themselves to forfeit £5OO
if Daniel Mullins fails to turn up for trial.
Not only is a ridiculous amount owing to the
law for forfeited bonds signed by people
whom even a senile J.P. should never have
accepted as security without close investiga-
tion, but the easy vanishment of Mullins,
who takes up the thread of his crimes where
he left off, is an aggravation. It is said that
there are Victorian lionoraries prepared to
accept the bond of anybody with a black
eye who says his name is Smith and that he
owns a station in Gippsland; and against
the gentleman who was disrated it was
alleged that his habit of being imposed upon
amounted to genius.
A N.S.W. Assembly Committee is strug-
gling with the ethics of pony-racing. It con-
sists of 10 members,' for there are many
ethics to inquire into, and one or two
“spares” are handy in case an M.L.A. should
be overcome by the stench and have to be
carried out. One humorless morning paper
is in the habit of heading its reports “Un-
fairness Charged.” The matters really
charged are swindling, lying, conspiracy,
breach of faith (carried to such an extent
that it is all breach and no faith), moral
leprosy, incivility, ugliness, contamination,
general depravity and complete lack of any
honest or productive means of support. The
most hopeful remedy so far suggested is to
plough up the courses and confiscate the
ponies; if that fails something drastic may
have to be done.
It was proudly reported the other day
that the filling-in of the Mackay-Proserpine
Creek gap had furnished Australia with
“the longest railway in the British Empire”
—5500 miles from Meekatliarra (W.A.) to
Dajurra (Q.). But a few things in connec-
tion with it might be a lot better. It is
owned by six separate Governments, or, at
least, they owe the original value of it. The'
present value is much less than the original
value, but none of the cost has
been paid off to balance the depreciation.
The debt is owed at 24 different rates of
interest; and it is owed in every State of
Australia, also in England, Scotland and the
United States. The dates of repayment wan-
der all over the shop. Reckoning from the
Westralian end the line begins on a 34ft.
gauge. Then it changes to 4ft. 84in., next
to 34ft. again, later to s|ft., then to 4ft.
84in. once more, and finishes up on the 34ft.
And it hugs the coast almost all the time.
But it is a great railway—ssoo miles long.
All the States subsidise mining more or
less, usually by loans to ancient concerns
that hope to renew their youth. The money
seldom comes back, and the youth never does.
Now Federal Treasurer Page has ideas of
lending money to the States for re-loaning
to mining shows in the hope that the par-
tially-dead corpse will sit up. Considering
the great mass of soldiers’ gratuity bonds
that fall due in 1924, one might imagine the
Commonwealth Government had enough busi-
ness of its own to do; but it has a craze for
attending to the other fellow’s job—especi-
ally when there is no money in it.
The best prospect for an improved Leg.
Council for N. S. Wales is to make it a
paid elective body, chosen by the whole
State as one constituency. Its inevitable
differences with the Assembly could be set-
tled at joint sittings, which should be numer-
ous and easily arrived at. Such a body
would afford a chance for big men. The pre-
sent Upper Housers, not being big men, as
a rule, wouldn’t be in it, so they are not
likely to recommend it. It couldn’t be gerry-
mandered, and it couldn’t be swamped, and
ii; wouldn’t afford a home for Ministers’
obscure little brothers, and it couldn’t be
suddenly abolished in a fit of pique as the
Queensland Council was.
N.S.W. Deputy Labor-leader Loughlin hit
the nail on the head when he said that the
guileless farmer frequently “puts one across”
the Public Works Committee. He is not
only an untrustworthy witness, but he
squeezes fictitious prices out of the State
for resumed land. The railways are thus
burdened with heavy capital charges, which
mean high freight rates; so Cocky suffers
from a hardship which is partly of his own
creation. In Argentina very little of the
land required for railway purposes is charged
for; in fact, subsidies have been paid by
owners towards capital outlay on the lines.
This is an aid to that cheap transportation
which is making Argentina so awkward a
competitor in several of the markets that
Australia once depended on.
A condensed description of Thursday
Island, administered from a distance of
1448 miles:—
Not one new structure has been erected on the
island for years. Many of the present buildings have
fallen into such disrepair that they are practically
worthless. Burnt buildings have not been replaced.
And the N. Territory, which is governed by
telegram from Melbourne, 3000 miles away,
reports a loss of population for the fifth
year in succession. The quantity of goods
exported to other States and foreign parts
has been: In 1920, 8750 tons; in 1921, 2213
tons; and in 1922. 513 tons. The quantity
sent abroad in 1922 was G 3 tons, which, for
a port which is the sea outlet for half a
million square miles, might almost be called
humble.
“L. Ree”: The A.D.F.A. (Australian
Dried Fruits Association) a week or two ago
reduced the Australian price of best-grade
raisins by 2d.— to per lb. But the body
which controls the Californian trade three
months ago fixed tlieir selling price at 11
cents (54d.). On these figures it would
need a preference of over £3O a ton, not to
mention the difference in freights, to give
Australia an even chance in the dried-fruit
market of Britain ; and it hardly looks as
if the Preference or any other horse
could carry the weight. Our costs of pro-
duction are too high : we’ve got little, if any-
thing, to hope from preference or anything
else until we can cut those figures.
Note from a dissatisfied region :
In a sense, Permian, Nationalist M.L.A. for
Byron (N.S.W.), was forced into voting against
the Valuer-General’s Department, even though his
vote put the Fuller Government in a hole. The
V.-G. is about as popular in Byron as a bad season.
His valuations might have been all right if the
fictitious land boom, made mostly by bananas, hadn’t
burst. Bunchytop has halved values on the Tweed,,
where Perdriau collects most of his votes, and he
simply had to protest. Even so, his chances of get-
ting back next election are not bright. His sub-
servience to the Government when the party whip
cracked won’t help him, and there is a suspicion
that he isn’t as sound as he might be on the New
State issue. Missingham, the Progressive, will most
likely top the poll. Nesbitt, who polls a heavy vote
on the Richmond, is another certainty. The third
seat will probably go to Labor again.
THE ALTRUIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“When Deputy Labor-leader Loughlin claimed that
Greg McGirr was making, all the trouble in the N. S.
Wales Labor party, McGirr effaced himself, thinking
to create harmony, but the sacrifice was in vain.
—Jack Dailey, AI.L A., in the Worker.
He laid about with vicious vim,
His gibes were fierce and mordant,
Till in the troubled Labor swim
A score of comrades reckoned him
The influence discordant.
But it would be a sad mistake
To deem black anger caused the break
When out the pale he placed himself;
’Twas simply harmony to make —
Merely for vanished concord’s sake-
That Greg McGirr effaced himself.
It wasn’t pique nor yet caprice,
Nor had his pride revolted;
He looked to see the dove of peace
(As Venizelos did in Greece)
Wing back when once he’d bolted.
If factious feuds he could allay
By going, ’twas not for him to stay ;
For sacrifice he braced himself....
Ah me! it grieves me sore to say
’Twas altruism thrown away.
Rages the internecine fray
As hotly as before the day
When Greg McGirr effaced himself.

The profits for the past 12 months were
easily the largest in volume; but there is
much more capital in the business than there
was eight and nine years ago, when costs
were easier and few restrictions were im-
posed on the flow of beer. Three years ago
Castlemaine and Wood Bros., of Newcastle,
was absorbed, and that deal alone required
an allotment of a quarter of a million of
Tooth shares. It brought in assets with
a book value of £490,000 in the busy indus-
trial and coal city. According to the pub-
lished accounts the profits for the period
covered by the introductory table were de-
rived in this way :

The “Wild Cat” doesn't take some of those
figures over-seriously. The gross profits dis-
closed were those remaining after provision
had been made for depreciation, bad and
doubtful debts and taxation, and there is not
the slightest doubt that some of the allow-
ances under those heads, and also for con-
tingencies not unassociated with the pro-
hibition campaign, have been very substan-
tial. The printed balance-sheets do not give
evidence of severe writing down; they pre-
sent only the bare skeleton of the business,
and you must have details as to the
purchases of properties and depreciation
allowed, together with particulars as to the
composition of the huge creditors account,
before you can know much about actual per-
formances. But if the directors have been
buying and improving properties, etc., out
of revenue, shareholders should not at pre-
sent regard the happening as other than a
strengthening of the provision against the
more or less remote contingency of the co.
being put out of the brewing and beer-selling
business. Perhaps in years to come, if every-
thing continues to go well, shareholders will
benefit directly; meanwhile it would be in-
advisable to invite further attention and
attack by lifting the div. rates above 10 p.c.
Last year’s disclosed profit returned
slightly more than 13 p.c. on the 2J millions
of capital, and the prefs. again received 10
p.c. along with the ordinaries. There is still
an anomaly with respect to the £550,000 of
pref. shares. They were issued as bonus
shares and are 6 p.c. cumulative. If profits
permit the directors can increase the pref.
div. “to such a rate as they may determine,”
so the extent of the prefs.’ participation over
and above 6 p.c. is wholly a matter for the
management. They may or they may not
participate in rich harvests —the directors
decide from time to time. To get rid of this
vagueness the present directors should not
hesitate to seek an amendment of the
Articles. The anomaly could be overcome by
allowing holders to convert into ordinaries
or into prefs. carrying a fixed cumulative div.
at some rate to be agreed upon—7 p.c. per-
haps.
One feature of the latest balance-sheet was
the increase of the book value of breweries,
plant, properties, etc., by £171,046 during the
year, making the total £2,144,291. Stocks
were £43,857 smaller at £278,669, and book
debts £116,041 larger at £652,170. Deposits,
public securities and debentures showed little
alteration at £96,961, but on the other side,
liabilities, all in the entry “sundry creditors,”
expanded from £297,411 to £469,988.

The shareholder in Henry Jones's co. can
learn very little about his investment. It
is purely a holding concern. Except for
£42,500 of War Loan, all assets are in this
bundle: “Shares and interests in jam-manu-
facturing and fruit cos. and timber mills in
the Commonwealth, South Africa, England
and America, £1,109,756.” Beyond the
statement of capital and reserves, the other
side of the balance-sheet is made up of:
“Amounts due to subsidiary cos., £139,012;
sundry creditors, £355.” The condition of
individual enterprises is completely masked
—in fact, it is impossible to ascertain what
and where the concerns are in which the co.
is interested. All the outsider knows is
that the business has been very profitable in
the past, and he must accept the parents’
disclosed profits as an intimation that, on the
whole, the widespread operations continue
highly profitable. In the matter of earn-
ings, the shareholder is told that last year
£106,046 of income was earned in the Com-
monwealth in addition, to £3260 interest on
War Loans, and that £107,904 remained
after office exes, had absorbed £1402. Out
ot that 10 p.c. (£73,276) was paid. Income
from investments outside of the Common-
wealth was £27,491 (compared with £18,396
in the previous year), and gave the 3| p.c.
bonus (£27,478). Whether the subsidiaries
are being bled of practically all their earn-
ings to give these results, or whether the
amounts disclosed represent only a portion of
the harvest, is not ascertainable. In all
matters relating to subsidiaries and other
interests the shareholder is asked to trust
implicitly to the five directors, Henry Jones,
A. W. Palfreyman, T. B. Nossiter, T. A.
Boyce, and It. F. Walker. No doubt, every-
thing in the Henry Jones dovecot is in order,
but from the point of view of the public
which puts in its good cash these holding
cos. are not altogether satisfactory. They
have become a habit in recent years; in one
or two instances there have been undesirable
features which have emphasised the necessity
for Stock Exchange committees exercising
caution in listing the shares of concerns
which threaten to hide their figures from the
investor.
This co.’s latest directors’ report suggests
that chairman Henry Jones has been taking
a course in writing reports from the Colonial
Sugar Refining Co. He has much to say
about the reckless development and financing
of orchards and canneries by various Govern-
ments, and the consequent over-supplying of
markets. He makes the astonishing state-
ment that “considerably more State Govern-
ment money is sunk in the canning industry,
and loaned to what are designated ‘co-opera-
tive canneries,’ than the total amount of
capital employed in all the privately-owned
(proprietary) canneries in the Common-
wealth.” “Until this futile and foolish policy
is radically transformed,” he adds, “your
directors will continue, as far as possible,
to employ the shareholders’ funds in re-
munerative channels outside the industry in
which they, and you, have so long been
directly concerned.” And in the next breath
shareholders are told of the directors’ inten-
tion to offer 146,551 new £1 shares at par
in May next, payable in four-monthly instal-
ments of ss. each. In view of the other state-
ments, surely some explanation should be
forthcoming as to the nature of the invest-
ments for which the cash is sought. Since its
inception in 1910 Henry .Tones Co-op. has
disclosed £1,118.109 of profits and distributed
£909,287 to shareholders.

The Evening News had been Sydney’s prin-
cipal evening paper for 40 years when an
enterprising crowd bought out tlie Austra-
lian Star at a bargain price and converted
it into a formidable competitor. The News
had been such a comfortable proposition for
the Bennett family that the enterprise of
the new crowd went almost unchallenged,
and it soon fell far behind in the race. It
passed into the control of a semi-public
co. five years ago, and a couple of years
later Sydney’s big retailers —represented by
Holdings, Ltd. —decided to become inter-
ested. They put in capital, and the busi-
ness was entirely re-organised and new
machinery installed. Altogether 100,000
shares were issued, at a premium of 2s. 6d.
per share, but at October 31 last only ss. 6d.
nad been paid up, leaving £72,500 callable.
A lot of this may be required presently, be-
cause the directors announce that the new
team has so successfully revived the busi-
ness that the plant put in during the past
year is being “severely taxed” and orders
have been placed for more. Later on funds
will probably be required for new premises
also; the 50 years’ lease of the present build-
ing has only a few years to go.
The directors show £23,104 of profit for
the past 12 months, but in the introductory
table £3OOO extracted as provision for taxa-
tion is not treated as profit. The extent
to which the balance is true profit depends
on how much of it, if any, is actually re-
quired to provide for replacement of plant.
From last year’s profits the directors have
set aside £67IS for replacements, making the
total in that account £19,718. It and £19,500 of
general reserves and a carry-forward balance
of £534 make up the “nominal reserves”
shown in the introductory table; they are
nominal for the reason, among others, that an
unstated amount of capital is represented by
“goodwill and newspaper establishment”—
intangible items which are grouped with
plant and machinery and make a total of
£180,793 in the published balance-sheet.
New equipment added £47.243 net during the
year, and as only £25,000 of new capital
was got in, and as both stocks and book
debts were larger, liabilities went from
£15,592 to £57,670. Other assets at October
31 were: Stocks, £57,182; book debts,
£35,927 ; cash, etc., £6013.

Pioneer Life and Accident Assurance
Co. of Australasia, Ltd. —New life cos.
continue to bob up here and there. This is
Melbourne’s latest; R. Laurie Nicholson has
had 171 years’ experience “in all depart-
ments of assurance”—lately as organiser for
one of the baby offices—anil has decided that
the time has arrived for him to become “gov-
erning director” of a show of his own. The
prospects of a successful career for this are no
brighter than for the multitude of other cos.
which have gone into the business lately.
So far as shareholders are concerned it is
entirely a gamble whether this co. can write
and manage assurances to show profits before
its capital. is exhausted. Conditions have
so altered in the life field that it has become
more and more difficult for a young office
to get its business on to a self-supporting
basis. This one proposes to specialise in
accident and sickness assurances and give
the most comprehensive cover; but unless
premium rates are fixed on a high scale the
promoters will find that the “all-in” sickness
business is not so easy as it looks. The
career of the M.L.C. is paraded to assure
shareholders that “a similar opportunity (as
regards dividends) awaits original share-
holders.” As a sample of prospectus-writing
the Pioneer’s invitation is in some respects
unique. Here is an extract:—
The essential to success is the ability to procure
business, and the success of the Pioneer Co. is
therefore assured.
Then follows the record of the promoter.
Another purple patch is—
Important.— A leading feature with assurance cos.
is that the cost of obtaining business is based on
commission, so that if the expenses are great the
volume of business is also great. Moreover, strikes
and industrial conflicts are unknown to assurance
cos., and so success is assured.
The truth is volume of business may break
a co. instead of making it —everything de-
pends upon the price which it costs.
In some cases new business nowadays
is being got on to the books by
young cos. at a cost of between 300 and 400
p.c., and in one instance an agency is under
contract to receive in initial commission
alone no less than 125 p.c. of the first year’s
premiums. Some of the new business being
accepted by young offices has no chance of
becoming self-supporting for a dozen years
or more, even under the most favorable con-
ditions.
The Pioneer is saddling itself with an
issue of 20,000 cumulative 10s. prefs. carry-
p.c. cumulative. The promoters are
asking as their consideration 5000 of these
prefs. and £lOOO cash. The public is also
offered 175,000 10s. ordinaries. The pros-
pectus provides for the payment of share-
selling commissions up to 10 p.c. Divs. to
shareholders are to be limited to 12 p.c. p.a.
and one-fifth of the net profits; but untii
the management proves itself, the vision of
divs. is nothing more than a mirage.

The year's profit gave nearly 14 p.c. on capi-
tal, and almost 2$ p.c. more than in the pre-
vious 12 months. But the div. rate was kept
down to 8 p.c., and additions to reserves made
them equal to nearly one-half of paid capital.
Building-society business lias been booming
in Melbourne, and the wise management, if
it takes advantage of the opportunity to ex-
pand its lending connection, also hoards sub-
stantial portions of the surplus earnings.
Land and property values in the soutnern
capital did not leap so rapidly as they did
in Sydney, probably because Melbourne,
which has had one bitter lesson, did not re-
spond so readily to the abnormal conditions
created by the heavy borrowing and hard
spending of the war-period and since. The
problems of building-society managements
are: (1) Whether the borrowers of to-day
will be in the position to repay regularly the
instalments of principal and interest; and
(2) whether, should defaulters be numerous,
buyers will be found for foreclosed proper-
ties at prices as large as the balances owing
when the original borrowers retired. Some
of the old hands have doubts whether the
present activity is on sound foundations, and
are standing off until the conditions look
more normal. The chief concern, of course,
is whether wages and salaries will continue
on the present high scale. Meanwhile, the
cautious managements have to some extent
been justified in their attitude by the slump
in the demand for suburban shops, many of
which are without tenants. The re-action in
that branch of spec.-building is so great that
mortgagees cannot be easily found, except at
prohibitive rates and at severely-curtailed
valuations.
Other societies, like the Union, are plung-
ing deeply into new loans, and seeking money
from all quarters to do it. Here are the
Union’s figures for 13 years

Liabilities at the latest balance were made
up of £00,783 of deposits, a loan of £15,127,
£0253 of overdraft and £177 of sundry credi-
tors. Every £1 borrowed was backed by
advances of slightly more than two guineas,
so one-half of the mortgage balances could
be lost before creditors need become really
uneasy. Whatever risk exists is chiefly in
respect of new business, on which very little
of the total advance has been repaid; on the
other hand the demands on the building
societies have been so great that manage-
ments have been able to make a selec-
tion. This society has also protected
itself by reserving the right to re-
duce the amount of a building loan if
workmanship is not up to specifications. Two
features of the Union’s constitution are
(1) The management is debarred from specu-
lating in property; and (2) though the
Building Societies Act permits cos. to accept
deposits up to three times their paid capital,
this one’s rules limit deposit borrowings to
twice its paid capital.

Sydney Guarantee and Trust Co.,
Ltd. (Sydney).—John Goodwyn, formerly
Insurance Commissioner in Queensland, and
later manager of the Australian Provincial
Assurance’s fire, marine and accident branch,
introduces this co. to finance people to
buy motor-cars on time-payment. The
S. G. and T.’s scheme, in the instance of a
car purchased for £450, is for the buyer to
pay down “at least £l5O, and he will usually
pay the balance (with interest and fees
added) by not more than 12 equal monthly
instalments, for which bills will in all cases
be given by him.” But besides interest and
fees, the promoters expect to win commis-
sions from motor-traders by converting their
t.-p. sales into cash transactions, and further
commissions by acting as agents for car-
insurances. The promoters are putting in
£5OOO cash in ordinaries, and are not taking
any shares or cash for introducing the
scheme: they go a step further and under-
take to draw no fees or salaries until 8 p.c.
has been paid on all shares. The public is
offered 20,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs. of £l, rank-
ing for both divs. and capital ahead of the

Pioneer Wood Pipe carries more water for its
diameter than any metal pipe. The smooth bore,
which becomes smoother with age, offers no obstruc-
tion to the flow, and its capacity never decreases,
as is the case with other pipe through corrosion,
tuberculation or accretions of sediment and organic
growth. Other factors in favor of adopting Pioneer
Wood Pipe for all water conduit schemes are its
cheapness, adaptability, lightness, simplicity of hand-
ling and installation. We have an interesting book

ordinaries, and entitled to follow ordinaries
point for point up to 15 p.c. in any year.
The co. proposes to apply the “usual fees
and interest” charged by other t.-p. concerns
to its business, and those rates have, ol
course, been lucrative. Everything in this
instance depends on the selection of risks,
and on watchfulness in requiring adequate
insurance cover. After allowing Is. per
share brokerage on placing scrip and paying
establishment costs, the promoters expect to
have £23,750 of working capital, which it
is estimated will enable the co. to lend at
least £45,000 per annum, representing
£65,000 of gross sales by motor-traders. Com-
missions of 5 p.c. from the latter would turn
in £3250; interest and fees (averaged at 8
p.c. p.a.) on advances is expected to produce
£3600- and 10 p.c. on insurance premiums
£2oo—a total of £7050. Working exes, and
taxes are reckoned to take £1450, leaving
£5600 for distribution. That would be suffi-
cient to give 15 p.c. on all shares, pay £lOOO
as directors’ and management fees, and leave
a balance of £B5O. This result is based on
the reckoning that funds will be fully em-
ployed, and depends on whether what seems
to be a low estimate of working costs is not
exceeded. Management will govern every-
thing.

Another secret is out about W. L. Bail-
lieu’s recent London trip. This is the deal
by which the Broken Hill heads, includ-
ing F. A. Govett (Zinc Corporation), in alli-
ance with the British Metal Corporation and
the coal-and-iron firm of Baldwins, Ltd.,
take over the Swansea and Avonmoutli zinc-
plants and secure a preponderating influ-
ence in the Burma Corporation. There is
thus a blend of Rand gold-bugs, London pro-
fessional directors, canny Midlands iron-
masters and Aussie liigh-finance in the deal.
The British Metal Corp. is particularly sweet
to the London wing of Collins House, because
the latter laid the co. on to Broken Ilill when
shares were cheap, introduced it to Electro-
lytic Zinc shares and debs., and helped it to
a turnover in New Guinea copper, which lias
yet to scintillate. The mysterious part of
the zinc deal is the arrangement under which
Britain undertakes to furnish seven years’
supply of zinc concentrates for the works now
being taken over. Swansea is an old hand at
zinc-smelting. Avonmoutli is somewhat of a
mystery: it sprang up during the war, when
Tilden Smith and his associates dumped hard
cash into British zinc and yoked up Burma
Corporation, some way or another. Whether
Smith is in the new deal is one of those
enigmas time will answer, but appearances a
while ago were that he and F. A. Govett
weren’t too friendly over Burma Corpora-
tion affairs. Anyway, it looks as if a tight
grip on the Burma Corp. mines is a good
thing for Broken Hill, provided North, South
and Zinc Corp. have a common understand-
ing regarding output and so on. Neverthe-
less, the inevitable Yank has to be reckoned
with in zinc; but as Hoover is more than
cosy with Baillieu, W. S. Robinson and
Govett, and was one of the makers of Burma
Corp., even Brother Jonathan may be in
the new show, ft is proposed to raise
£1,500,000 of capital, so new works must
be in view. In that case Electrolytic Zinc
experience at Risdon (Tas.) will be of value
to the venture.

A Melbourne crowd which has been in-
terested in the retorting processes of the
Southern Cross Motor Fuels, Ltd., at La-
trobe (Tas.) and Yarraville (Vic.), proposes
to make a start at Newnes (N.S.W.) and
show .John Fell how the Wolgan shales
should be handled. The proposed co. is Wol-
gan Oil Refineries, Ltd., in 300,000 £1 shares ;
100,000 are offered for subscription, and
60,000 fully-paids and £4OOO cash go to
vendor cos. (The Bright Gold-mining Syn-
dicate is to receive 25,000 paids for six blocks
each of one square mile, and the Southern
Cross crowd 35,000 for licenses to use its
processes.) Thus from the outset the enter-
prise is top-heavy: there is no question as
to the shale, but there is some doubt regarding
the retorting methods when operated on a
full commercial scale, and following the Com-
monwealth Oil Corp.’s fiasco the newcomers
might at least have made their cut contin-
gent on performances. A lengthy prospectus
has a lot to say about the behavior of the
Southern Cross Co.’s retorting and refining
processes, particularly with respect to their
automatic operation and the winning of larger
proportions of the contents of the shales.
The proposal is to put in five retorts, which
are expected to treat 30 tons shale each per
day, giving 15,750ga1. natural benzine per
week and 26,700ga1. converted motor-spirit.
Weekly revenue is estimated at £2351, and
mining, retorting and refining costs at £1704,
giving a gross working profit of £33,644 per
annum. The figures might be easier to swal-
low if the promoters supplied figures regard-
ing actual performances at Latrobe and
Yarraville.

B. H. South has lately had a peck of
trouble from the Central fire. Some weeks
ago distinct signs of fire appeared near the
Central boundary; official statements re-
ferred to gas only, but it was believed to be
more serious than that. Some good work
was done, and at present there is no sign of
fire, and barring the boundary stopes on the
top levels the mine is free of gas. The cen-
tral recently completed a grid of tunnels over
the affected area. Most of the surface water
curtains were stopped, and the flow concen-
trated in these tunnels. The South was
getting' a lot of this water; mining had
again to cease on the 1270 ft. level, and
only for strenuous bailing and pumping the
1170 ft. would have been flooded also. A
connection on the south 1170 ft. to the
stopes in the Central has been completed,
and the water coming in above the lllUlt.
is now being returned to the Central through
this opening. # ,
Harold Sampson, W. H. Vidler, E. P.
Johnson and J. K. Charleston figure as a
provisional directorate in a prospectus issueu
by N. C* Clark to float off the Breakfast
Creek Tin Co., Emmaville (N.S.W.). Six
leases totalling 114 acres at Specimen Hill,
] 7 miles nor’-west of Emmaville, are to
be taken up. According to J. K. Charles-
ton, four parallel lodes traverse the hill
north-east and south-west, and two cross
lodes intersect them. A 15-hd. mill, Hunt-
ingdon mill, boiler, engine and large pump
go with the leases. Estimated production
is 250 tons of 5 p.c. concentrate a week, and
working costs are given at 20s. a ton. The
proposed co. is in 5000 20s. shares, of which
1000 paids go to the vendors, along with
£4500 in cash spread over seven months.

Just when The Bulletin last week was
commenting on the absence of results from
driving 200 ft. off the new South Lucknow
(N.S.W.) mainshaft, the picks tapped ‘a
large ore-body showing arsenical pyrites and
gold,” and at latest the crosscut had gone
4ft. “all through lode,” and assays were
talking in ounces. That’s all there is
to it so far, and it is impossible to hazard
whether the make is merely one of the occa-
sion al ore-bulges which raise and then dash
hopes, or is portion of a spur making on
the contact like those which hoarded pheno-
nienal values in the old field alongside, the
market immediately became jumpy on the
mention of gold, and contrib. shares, which
had collapsed to nominal quotations of a
penny or so, soared to almost within touch
of their paid-up price.
* * * *
More Lucknow (N.S.W.) records:—
The promotion of cos. to tackle claims previously
worked by small parties began about 1889. The
United Miners acquired the right to the veins on
seven of the best of the abandoned claims. The
00. then renamed itself the Great Britain, and raised
£50,000 of capital, its next alias being the Uncle
Tom. The mainshaft was sunk to 300 ft., but mis-
management above and below counted the co. out.
Newman stepped in and bought the derelict for
£lBOO, formed a £2OOO co., assumed the manage-
ment, and in three years paid bis shareholders
£35,000 in divs. The mine and machinery were
then sold for £25,000, and the New Reform 00.
was floated with a capital of £60,000. Another co.
was the Golden Point, which secured a holding over
several of the other claims, from which prospectors
had been expelled by water and the monthly tenure.
There were no exemption courts giving licenses to
“shepherds” in those days. “Work the claim or
forfeit it” was the rule.
Frank Gardiner, a theatrical manager for J. C.
Williamson and for years associated with Carrie
Swain, came into Lucknow affairs along with New-
man in the middle ’eighties, and for a few years
played a prominent part. The lure of Lucknow
gold was stronger than that of the footlights, and
Gardiner found the emoluments much more satisfac-
tory. To-day he lives a retired life of luxury on
the Quay d’Orsay. In the late ’eighties Gardiner
and Newman were well in the Wentworth, Jackass,
Homeward Bound, Spier’s and others. They intro-
duced London capital to do things on a big scale.
The profitable era of the English cos. was from
1891-99, with their noble lords, major-generals,
admirals and other scientific “miners” swarming the
directorates in London and administering from Throg-
morton-street overlapping areas where one set of
officials would have been ample. Throgmorton-
etreet’s chief function was to receive hundreds of
pounds’ worth of cables every year and draw aggre-
gate divs. running into nearly £600,000. The
branch offices in Pitt-street coped with the serious
business. The Wentworth Prop, had a capital of
£500,000 in 20s. shares, of which 150,000 ranked
as “priority,” and carried rights out of all propor-
tion to the services rendered by their holders. These
shares were the cream as marketable securities. The
Aladdin’s Lamp was an overlapping co. of 100,000
20s. shares, with interlocking directorate, offices and
general management. Between them they took in
the Homeward Bound, Spier’s, Phoenix, Jackass,
Golden Point and Shamrock, besides outlying leases.
A managerial report from the Aladdin’s Lamp
in 1894 stated that “the east drive was extended
293 ft., 195 ft. of which was in the Wentworth Co.’s
property.” The Wentworth ran its own 20-head of
stamps and Aladdin its 10-head. In the deeper levels,
from 300 ft. to below 1000 ft., these two cos, recovered
£882,035 worth of gold between 1892 and 1899.
They were never in the category of mendicant gold-
shows, as their balance-sheets usually showed £15,000
at credit after allocations. In their best year, 1895,
gold production ran into nearly 20,0000 z. At that
time the Wentworth employed 230 men at the mine
and the Aladdin 75.
As the miners received only 7s. 6d. a day, they
were naturally tempted by the glitter around them,
but gold-stealing prosecutions occurred only after
Warnford Lock’s arrival. The last case was that of
a shoemaker, a receiver, who was detected late at
night in. 1896, when roasting pyrites ore. Warnford
Lock was coming home in his buggy from Orange
and detected the peculiar smell of roasting pyrites.
After the arrest of the culprit many local cesspits
were good prospecting as the “dumps” of parcels ot
rich ore.
During the present century gold production has
been negligible, and about 1910 the curtain fell on
British effort. The shareholders overseas had become
so rich from divs. and share-market manipulations
that they were more ready to close down than to
spend some of their wealth in searching for odds
and ends that may have been overlooked.
Only 21,000 contributing shares carry the
shilling call dealt out by the Lloyd George
(W.A.) as a Christmas box in place ot
the div. forecasted earlier in the year. That
so few are called upon is due to the lax
system of granting “options” over large
blocks of shares without binding the option-
holder. Had Alfred Forbes taken the block
of 10,000 optioned to him at ss. till the end
of September, or had he turned them oyer
at 15s. in Adelaide when he had an offer,
the call-paying group would have been aug-
mented by that number. But the market
went wrong in unison with the mine work-
ings, ore bodies and values; and Mr. Forbes
decided “not to exercise his option.” There
is no glitter about 10,000 shares at ss.
when the brokers offer to sell at 2s. on
’Change.
Lander Oil has been one of the most ener-
getic of the cos. prospecting for petroleum
in the Commonwealth. Since registration
on December 9 last year it has booked up its
12,000 acres at Orallo (Q.), completed topo-
graphical and structural surveys, had direc-
tors Milsom and Burns in California, pur-
chased and erected plant, and is already
down 300 ft. or so with the hole. Milsom is
taking no chances with gas and water, and
is putting in 18in. casing and cementing at
in position. The drilling team —the three r ife
brothers from California are the backbone —
will have a few days’ spell-o; apart from
that drilling will go on right through the
holiday season. At the first annual meeting,
held in Sydney yesterday, the directors pre-
sented accounts showing that after meeting
all charges to date, and paying for plant and
machinery (£21,445), nearly £13,000 of cash
was in hand. Calls in arrear amounted to
£2042, and £5060 more was callable on the
50 000 £1 contribs. So there is approxi-
mately £20,000 of cash in hand and within
hail to pay for drilling.
* * * *
The usual strike is on at Baralaba State
coalmine (Q.), and the colliery is rapidly
qualifying for the record for stoppages.
Work is not likely to be resumed before the
New Year. Meanwhile Blair Athol is reap-
ing the benefit. And it can do with the
lift- last month its mines were working
only two or three shifts weekly. J. F. Halls
original scheme for a direct line to the coast
from Blair Atliol is not entirely abandoned.
A little quiet spadework is being done m
that direction, but the chief stumbling-block
is the high coastal range which has to be
negotiated.
* * * *
A recent discovery on Eungulla, behind
Mackay (Q.), has uncovered a 3ft. lode m
granite carrying fairly high values in copper,
lead and silver, with occasional assays show-
ing low to moderate gold values. The loca-
tion is remote, being on the other side ot a
2000 ft. range from the railway, but it is the
most promising discovery yet made m this
district. It is not very far from the old
Eungulla goldfield, where lately . fossiclters
have hit some good specimen gold in leaders.
It looks like a possible metal district when
the almost impenetrable scrub is conquered.
* * * *
Hercules, Bendigo, is to dazzle the ring
next year after a long spell of costly tiain-
ing Average stone forthcoming from south
at" 1390 ft has kept the pot simmering, but
a strike of rich stone high up in the stopes
at 1380 ft. has set the market on the boil.
The first thing to do will be to hunt for the
shoot in the level overhead. The mine has
levels open at 1400 ft., 14 1 5 ft. and 1240 ft. All
of them carry low-grade quartz, but they
will be pushed out to strike the new shoot on
its downward run. At 480 ft. from the cross-
cut at 1520 ft. a centre-country winze on the
new reef has carried 17dwt. stone to the
bottom at 70ft., and a crushing from there
shows high values. When one of the inter-
mediate workings gets on to the extension
of the 1380 ft. shoot the old claim is in for
a revival. Bendigo, as usual, got in early
to relieve tired call-payers of their burden.
The co. is moderately capitalised: there are
65,000 shares, so that it will not take much
to’set divs. going. .

After six months’ waiting, Bux Co. learns
what fixed duty and tribute money it will
have to pay the Dutch Government on its
Borneo oil concessions. This news is inter-
preted to imply that the co. has a good title
to its holdings. To settle everything High
Commissioner Joe Cook in London has been
asked to sound the Hague officially. H. 8.
Lyne’s advice to Bux to drop some of the
blocks and obtain other concessions has been
followed, so that now the co. holds 80,000
acres in four blocks. Cash is the next need.
A float of 300,000 £1 shares is on the cards,
100,000 parts to go to Bux, 37,500 to Boyd,
12,500 retained for flotation purposes or for
reserve, and 150,000 offered for subscription
at 2s. each with calls as required. As Bux
has 2000 shares, every holder will be entitled
to apply for 50 shares for each Bux held.
Lyne’s report is thought to be strong enough
to carry the float through. Bux will get
1 p.c. royalty on the gross proceeds from
all oil, plus its wad of free scrip. So its
platter is heaped high. The cost of the
Borneo expedition has been £3627, which is
far from outrageous.

“8.V.E.” : Ever hear of a father and his

terval of 20 years between ? I was tin
gouging at Mooleyella, nine miles from
OH! IF ONLY HE WERE!
MRS. PECK: “You miserable little rat!”
MR. PECK : “I wish I were. I’d have you up on the table squealing
for mercy.”
Marble Bar (W.A.) in 1908, and as a cal-
low youth of 19 got a rotten attack of dengue
fever. There wasn’t a conveyance of any
kind on the field, not even a horse, so my
mate, Jim Ilanson, a man of twice my age,
bundled me into a Cousin Jack barrow and
trundled me nine miles to the Marble Bar
Hospital. It was a near thing for me; the
doctor was of opinion that a single day s
delay would have been fatal. Nine weeks
passed before I got out. Meanwhile Jim had
got a good offer for the claim and sold,
bringing me my cut; and that was the last
I ever saw of him. In July. 1918. 1 was
sniping with a mate in a nasty possie about
a quarter of a mile from our front line n.-w.
of Villers-Bretonneux just after daylight.
Jerry’s shells began to land all about us,
and a ricoclietting fragment knocked me
out temporarily. I came to a little later to
find my mate had dragged me 50 yards to
a bit of a sap, whence we watched our late
refuge being obliterated. Later I placed the
facts before our O.C. and my rescuer got
the M.M. for his work. Happening to meet
him when on leave in London later on I
mentioned Mooleyella and spoke in glowing
terms of my old mate Jim Hanson. Ho
gripped my hand and said simply. “That
must be my dad you’re speaking of.” Then
we got to details, and it was!
“Patrick”: It was at a King Country
(M.L.) post-office recently, and a pretty Maori
woman came in to send a telegram. Being
unable to write “te Hengrisli,” she begged
for assistance, which was cheerfully given
by the clerk. Everything went well until
the young man asked the sender of the mes-
sage where she lived—he wanted to put the
required name and address on the back of
the document. “Oh, just up te river,” was
the reply, and repeated questions failed to
elicit anything more definite. “Well, then,
I’ll have to know where you live when
you’re in town,” said the clerk in despera-
tion. The wahine’s face, previously a trifle
suspicious, broke into a smile, and then one
eye contracted in a wink. “By gorry,” she
said, “I tink you te hard case.”
“H. Hardupp” : The Law discovered a sort
of junior Ku Klux Klan in Sydney the
other morning, and, instead of treating it as a
brother born on the wrong side of the blan-
ket, said shortly “20s. or three days.” Fol-
lowing a mix-up in a restaurant in which
black eyes and vegetables were distributed
with cheerful impartiality, the magistrate
was asked to listen to cross-charges of
assault and language. The restaurant boss
said that the two men he charged were
nuisances, and he had refused to serve
them. The nuisances explained that they
were members of a “Complaints Club” —a
body of men who, in view of the bad con-
ditions prevailing in many eating-houses, had
banded themselves together to visit these
places and systematically grumble them into
making reforms. They claimed that their
methods had been responsible for improving
many hash-joints that had defied all the
regular efforts of the Law to improve them.
And then the Law, as already remarked,
barked something with gaol in the tail of it.
“0.P.L1.” : Notwithstanding that the State
Parliament has not
risen for the re-
cess, the silly
season has begun
in Melbourne, and
the Age has fallen
back upon the
Federal Statist’s
figures regarding
first births. Hav-
ing expended some
exclamation marks
over the coming
into the world of a
first child after the
parents had been
married 23 years,
it worked up to an
anti-climax by quot-
ing details showing
that in 1922 there
were 74f>2 births in
the Commonwealth
within six months
of marriage. Jack
Murray, when Vic.
Chief Sec., was
asked by his Gov-
ernment, whic h
was bent o n
economy, to cut
down “non-essential
printing.” Jo h n
started by running
his pencil through
these ante-nuptial
figures, holding
that it was not his
job to supply “texts
for homilies for sen-
sationalists.” All
the same, they have
their significance,
though it isn’t
always easy to say
what the signifi-
cance is.
“Oxmead” : The human race, by all
accounts, is immune from cattle plague, just
as some of the most deadly pestilences that
afflict mankind are incommunicable to the
brute creation. So it is presumably mere
coincidence that the dreaded rinderpest should
have appeared for the first time m Australia
at almost the exact spot wlieio the pneu
monic ’flu of 1918-19 raged with a virulence
known nowhere else in the Commonwealth
until its victims, of whom there were merci-
fully few, died or recoveied. This particu-
larly devastating form of a scourge that
swept all over the world came to Fremantle
m a troopship from Durban; sufferers and
contacts were promptly isolated in tents at
Woodman’s Point, on the seaboard, about
four miles south of the port. The disease
was pinned down in this one place and soon
stamped out, but not before several Diggers
and, what was even more tragical, four de-
voted nurses had succumbed to it in a few
days. Probably not even bubonic ever took
a speedier or deadlier toll in any part of
Australia where it was confined to one tiny
area. And it was in a herd of dairy cattle
TOO LATE! TOO LATE!
“Darling, how often have I asked yon not to sit up for me?”
"You've slipped a cog, Charley. I'm not going to led — I’m getting up.”
that have grazed about this place that rinder-
oest suddenly appears from nobody knows
where. A pure coincidence, no doubt, but a
sinister one,
“Centurion”: Yet another small Austra-
lian has proved himself able to tackle a
man’s job. He is an eight-year-old living at
Lithgow (N.S.W.), where his dad is a
policeman, and his name is Edwards. Missing
his five-year-old sister, who had been playing
with him in the park, he went to the baths
near by, climbed over the fence, and hauled
the little girl out of four feet of water. And
after administering first aid, he spared her
blushes by dressing her before carrying her
home for further treatment.
* * * *
“Howitzer” : A cobber of mine had a weird
experience at Pozieres. Prior to enlistment
he suffered from sleep-walking, but active
service seemed to have cured the malady.
One night, when he was on outpost duty,
we saw a wildly-flying figure, liberally pep-
pered at by a Hun machine-gunner, doing
a record from Fritz’s line to our outpost.
Arriving untouched, his explanation was
that he’d been suddenly awakened by a bomb
exploding, and found himself a few yards
from a Hun outpost. He had walked fully
300 yards in his sleep.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: The model husband has been
brought to light in Sydney. Eleven years
married, he has never spent a single evening
away from home, unless it was occupied in
taking his wife to some function ; he is a
non-smoker and a non-drinker, and his favo-
rite recreation is working about his home
and his garden. These details are not part
of a funeral eulogium; curiously enough,
they were the admissions made by a wife
opposing this husband's suit for restitution
of conjugal rights. When a puzzled Judge
asked why she objected to return to such an
epitome of the domestic virtues, she said that
somehow she could not be happy with him.
And she showed further what she felt by
telling the Court, when the order was made,
that she would let the perfect man divorce
her. Apparently living with a model may
grow irksome —unless you happen to be an
artist.
“Old Timer” : The bush lads are still hold-
ing their own. One at Hernani (N.S.W.)
was bitten on the leg by a black snake the
other day, and as his parents were in trouble
over the illness of one of his sisters, he de-
cided to treat himself and say nothing to
them. He sliced away the flesh around the
puncture, rubbed permanganate of potash in
the wound, and then applied a hot iron to
stop the bleeding. His comment to me a
day or two later was: “I never was so sick
in my life as I was that night.”
* -X- * *
“Ghev”: For years past it has been piti-
ful to encounter in the cities ex-Diggers
who accept cornet-blowing and box-rattling
as an easy means of adding a living income
to their pensions—pitiful, not alone because
of the humiliation (to which, unfortunately,
most of the maimed men rapidly became im-
mune) , but because something far better
than begging to music should be the portion
of men who have fought and bled for their
country. I had occasion to visit the Table-
lands of N. S. Wales lately. At Armi-
dale a trio of one-legged Diggers haunted
the main streets with the usual portable har-
monium, cornet and collecting-box. Two
days later I saw the same hapless group
in Glen Innes; a day after that they were
at Tenterfield. They were “on the track,”
and probably are only the advance corps of
the city army of maimed musicians. In
other words, the problem of how to get these
men off the streets, having run its course
in the cities unsolved, is now being trans-
ferred to the country towns.
“The Deacon”: The Bishop of Cork, it
is cabled, has refused to allow the body of
one Dennis Barry, who suicided per hunger
strike, to lie in state in any of the churches
in his diocese. This is the, weapon which
surpasses all else in the way of punishment
in the Irish R.C. mind, the deprivation of
Christian burial. Had it been employed
sooner—had the same Bishop of Cork de-
nounced Terence McSwiney when he was
suiciding in his English prison—he might
have done much to stem the horrors of the
late civil war. Still, although seriously be-
lated, Bishop Cohalan’s strictures, in accord-
ance with the law of the church, may do
some good. Mention was recently made in the

must have! She’s always smiling.”

cables of some 300 hunger-strikers in the gaols
of Ireland. If these misguided persons real-
ised that they are merely risking excom-
munication and not bidding for martyrdom,
it might bring them to a more sensible frame
of mind.

“Mag” : A publican at Port Maryborough
(Q.) was fined £2O the other day for serving

sistent ass in its way of regarding some

“Sixenate”: The name for quality that
Australia has earned abroad is being ex-
tended to criminals; whenever a particu-
larly smart international swindler or mags-
man is laid by the heels in Europe it is a
safe thing to expe,ct him to be presently
credited to this part of the
Avorld. But some big in-
roads have been made re-
cently into the high-grade
spieling gangs which have
given the Commonwealth a
reputation for producing
super-crooks. The last of a
number of captures is
“Nobby” Melaney, whose
parents are said to have
been Irish-Australians, and
who is estimated to have
helped himself to a quarter
of a million by confidence
ti-icks, although a mere mat-
ter of £4OO led to his un-
doing. Physically Melaney is
a big man who threw a good
deal of money about amongst
holidaying Diggers during
the latter days of the war—
the early days he probably
spent in America or Spain. He
may have been after the cash
of some of the wealthy men in
the A.1.F., but I don’t think
he was actuated by any feel-
ing except good-fellowship.
There was a case in which
a youngster got into difficul-
ties and had to raise £7O
very promptly to save him-
self from great trouble. It
could have been got from
home, but that would have
meant a confession to old
people who would be hard hit
by it. Melaney got to hear
of the business, squared it,
talked to the youngster like
an old family parson, and
sent the boy off. And the
queer thing was that when
the youngster presently
wrote to him the usual
grateful letter he got a reply that there was
apparently some misunderstanding some-
where—that Melaney didn’t have the honor
to know his correspondent.
On Black Brother's sense of humor (the
yarn is told by a bishop who sometimes packs
a swag and lights out into the bush by way
of a holiday) :
About four days out from I struck a small
tribe of blacks, some two dozen in all, of varying
sex, size and raiment, accompanied by the usual
assortment of nondescript hounds. As they seemed
friendly and evidently knew the country, where
water was none too frequent, I decided to accom-
pany them for a while. Billy, the leader, was
a fine athletic-looking
fellow with an inex-
pungible grin, a buxom
gin and a white-
bearded old father,
Jacky. I was quite
touched with the way
Billy looked after his
aged parent, carried
his blanket, helped him
along at times, and
even gave him choice
morsels of food, treat-
ing the old man with
a respect that many
professing Christians
fail to observe. About
sunset we struck a
waterhole and made
ready to camp. TCa
was half consumed
when Billy seized his
gun, an old muzzle-
loader with half the
barrel gone, and fired
at something moving
across the bank behind
us. I could see noth-
ing in the dusk, and
Billy was too lazy to
investigate his bag.
After a comfortable
smoke by the Are, 1
rolled in a little to
windward of the com-
pany and was soon
asleep. At dawn I was
awakened by a din.
The whole camp was
in fits of laughter.
Billy was doubled up
with mirth, despite
the fact that from
the gesticulations of
the others I inferred
that the joke was on
him. At last I man-
aged to elicit a splut-
tering explanation from
a comrade. Billy
had mistaken his father for something unspecified jn
the dusk and had shot him. I went to investigate.
Sure enough the poor old man was lying dea f
behind the bank.

“Mowbray”: Talking of queer war-
wounds. A cobber of mine at Ypres in lb
carries the mark of a unique scrap. Ihree
of us occupied a shell-hole as an improvised
bombing-post. During the still hour that
preceded the stand-to (about 4 a.m.), Mac
was staring into the ghastly half-dawn,
when all the shadows wore the horrid shapes
of enemies armed with deadly weapons. We
other two were just climbing up from a dis-
turbed slumber, when Mac gave a yell, and
a long, black shape had him by the throat.
After a few seconds’ scramble in the con-
fined space, a lucky stab with a bayonet
accounted for his assailant —a large, short-
haired, black dog, wearing on his a
collar with the legend, “Immer Vorwarts.
“Morob”: One effect of a recent fire in
Ilabaul’s Chinatown will be to clear
out an insanitary nest of underground
passages and alleyways that must have been
a menace to the health of the entire com-
munity. The first thing that the average
Chink does on taking over a dwelling is to
board up windows and other apertures where
light and fresh air may possibly enter; the
second, if the adjoining premises are occupied
by others of his race, is to construct passages
between his house and the neighbors. In
pre-war days the Chinese quarter in Rabaul
was one vast warren, where it was possible
to enter by one door and come out by an-
other 60 yards away, without once stepping
into the open. During the military occupa-
tion a general clean-up of a large portion
of the malodorous area was carried out by
the medical authorities ■ but it soon relapsed
into its normal condition.
•** * *
The office Savonarola again :
The pernicious effects of the newspaper competi-
tions by which certain dailies are maintaining a
semblance of life go deeper than the business of
ministering to the diseased vanity of a few hundred
publicity-hunting females. They are doing more
to undermine the modesty and morals of a frequent
type of city flapper than all the erotic films and
sex novels. I don’t say that the appearance of a
girl’s counterfeit presentment, half- or three-parts
naked, in the back pages of a newspaper is detri-
mental per se. In some cases the photographs are
taken at home. In others, however, the girls go
singly or in hysterical batches to be snapped at
the offices of the rag holding the competition. Neces-
sarily there is no such supervision as is obligatory
even in the case of an ordinary leg-show. The rest
may be imagined. Apart from the temptations to
which young women are subjected in the preliminary
stages of these enterprises, there is the objection that
the appearance of their portraits, with addresses
attached, brings on those with any shadow of good
looks a flood of correspondence—much of it unsavory.
A girl in my suburb, in addition to an offer of
marriage from a colored man, scored three invita-
tions to go up-country as “companion,” and a com-
munication which smacked strongly of the white-
slave traffic. She happened to be respectable, but
notoriously these competitions are being exploited
by girls of another class to advertise their alleged
charms or to secure excuses for accosting strange
men in public without the intervention of the police.
“Ashmead”: “Blanc” (B. 8/11/’23) has
blown the “fall in” for queer monikers. Near
the town of Hamel, where the memorable
August 8 push started, there were two woods.
The one further away from the slathered
village was called Hamel Wood. A finger-
post at the crossroads pointed to the other
one, and bore the inscription “Notamel
Wood.” Here’s another. Old Major “Had”
Giblin (now the Speck’s statistician) had
an ancient nag which was always spoken of
as Gum Boots. It kept him out of the mud.
“Macann” : This is the fire-brigades’ story
of the “pommy.” A dense cloud of smoke
poured from the top of a three-storeyed build-
ing. From the street two cliooms, who came
to Sydney as agricultural experts and were
on trial in the brigade, played a stream of
water on a bright glare just visible above the
edge of the roof. When the officer in charge
spotted them he swallowed something and
drawled: “I say, you two, you won t put that
flaming light out from there that s the
blanky moon rising.”
* * * *
“Uramao”: Pars about out-of-date educa-
tion books remind me that in a no-license
town in Otago (M.L.) the school reader
used up till quite lately contained illustra-
tions from photos taken 30 years previously.
In the foreground of one of these was a large
brewery that had disappeared a quarter of
a century before. The citizen who viewed
this illustration with most disgust was the
man who built that brewery, amassed Ins
wealth from it, and finally razed it to the
ground. He had turned Prohibitionist in Ins
old age, and at public meetings was vehement
in denunciation of the commodity which had
enriched him.
* * * *
“Delver”: The twentieth-century electri-
cian is disturbing the shade of Governor Mac-
quarie in the old Histrict Court building in
Queen’s-square, Sydney: nothing will do but
he must put in his new-fangled light. Mac-
quarie thought this building one of
the masterpieces of his useful reign.
Opened in June of 1819 by the
officials of the convict-assignment sys-
tem, it was from this depot that free set-
tlers obtained their cheap labor; as many as
a thousand-odd “migrants” were housed
NO PLACE FOR HER SORT.
“But, my dear, the girl’s a little angel.”
“Very well; she can fly then.”
there, though the building was designed to
hold only 150. When the assignment system
was abolished in 1840 the place presently
became a depot for female immigrants, being
also used by the officials of the Immigration
Department as administrative quarters. The
District Court, which was born in May, ’44,
took up its abode there later. A couple of
years ago slight alterations were made to the
interior, which necessitated the removal of
some of the timber beams; but the wood was
found to be in such perfect condition that it
was put back to work again.
THE STAIRCASE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The staircase leads to anywhere—to gardens wet and
green,
To furtive pathways lost and fair where poets’ feet
have been.
Its shallow steps are bright and bare, with lichen
gold between.
There stands pink larkspur like a cloud lit on a rigid
stem
And amaryllis rich and loud, with bees for diadem.
And soft nasturtium-browns that crowd a lawn’s o’er-
lapping hem.
It leads to privet hedges dipt in pheasant and in
ball,
To marble figures icy lipped, where warm red roses
fall;
And sometimes, when high hope has tript, it leads
nowhere at all!
At times, when all the world is blue and quivering
into dusk,
You find pale heaven looking through a floating
haze of musk
For petalled moons that perfect grew in the hori-
zon’s husk—
Small silver moons that memories bear from the
enchanted lands.
Beside the entrance to the stair a broken statue
stands;
Its blind eyes mock its mouth’s despair, it waits
with outheld hands
To point how far the stairway leads into the pit of
night
Where some sick heart a haven needs, and cheated
eyes a light,
Just as the broken statue pleads for some foregone
delight.
The staircase leads to anywhere—ah, once it led
to you!
We planted gardens fine and fair and all of them
seemed true....
To-day I place a sentry there lest thought should
stumble through.

1 rom an Old Parliamentary Hand :
When Alec Peacock introduced his first Factories
Bill providing for wages boards 27 years ago, he
had an audience of about 80 members, who watched
with interest the youngish, lanky, dark-haired Chief
Sec. in the first Turner Government make what till
then was his most important speech. On Thursday
he submitted an amending bill—and instead of
a full House he had a bare quorum. The measure
was far more radical than that of 1896; yet the
House hardly turned a hair. It regarded as a
reasonable thing- that an agreement arrived at by
70 per cent, of employers and employees respec-
tively at a conference should have a wages-board
stamp put on it. And in Peacock himself, silver-
haired, corpulent, persuasive, diplomatic, with a com-
pliment for everybody, it was hard to identify the
man of 1896. Well, they’ve been a crowded 27
years for him, anyhow; and he has not drowsed
through them.
A reliable item in the record of Adam
Lindsay Gordon has been found by Adel-
aide Registek. There were legends that he
resigned from the police force in 1855 be-
cause lie was asked to clean the boots of a
superior officer; also, that it was on account
of his haying to drive an intoxicated woman
—name given—to the cells in a wheelbarrow.
An official report from the local Inspector
Scott to the Commissioner of Police in Adel-
aide settles the question :
Penola, November 1, 1855. —In answer to your
memo, respecting the resignation of pciice-trooper
Gordon, I have the honor to inform you that he told
me he intended to turn his attention to driving
cattle to market. I am not aware that he was dis-
satisfied with the police force, but I imagine he
thinks it more lucrative to be a drover. 1 am sorry
to lose him, as he has conducted himself remarkably
well while stationed here, which has been for a
period of about 18 months.
Nelson Illingworth has made a bust in
clay of Denison Miller. It is to be sent to

son also, a fine bit

Concerning “Pilky,” M.P.
Pilkingtoti, the Westralian lv.C., who was M.L.A.
foi Perth from 1917 till 1921, has become a British
M.P. at his second attempt. tTridiscouraged by the
loss of his £lOO deposit in Dundee last year t Win-
ston Churchill was one of his opponents), he stood
for Keighley, a Yorkshire constituency, and unseated
a Labor member who had scrambled in between the
Conservative and the Liberal in 1922 with a majority
of 4656. By contrast with Pilkington’s pertinacity,
J. D. Connolly, his predecessor in the representa-
tion of Perth, declined to stand because the
Conservative organisation jibbed at nominating
him, a perfect stranger, for an easy rural
electorate. Dublin born and 53 years old,
“Pilky” is very tall, very frigid and very
clever. He is a first-class pleader, and made at
least £5OOO p.a. during] most of the 27 years he
spent in Groperland (he was ex-Premier Walter
•lames s partner), but in politics he failed utterly.
The one noteworthy thing- he did as member for
Perth was to move for a reduction of £150,000 —
about 30 p.c.—in the Education vote, after which
he came to be regarded as a hopeless reactionary,
tet in Britain he is classed as a Liberal of a rather
extreme type.
The Speck has lost one of its old-time
volunteer officers in Col. T. M. Evans.
Though he was nearly 80 when he died, the
veteran was the first man in Tas. to offer
himself in the recent war, and, much against
Ins grain, he was kept on the home front,
being given the job of censor for the Speck.
Evans earned his bread in the Derwent and
T-'mar Insurance Co., of which he was for
a long time manager and later chairman of
directors.

sions to everybody and see that they were
earned; but radical thought centred later
around the capital levy, which Petlirick
Lawrence has solemnly fathered in Labor
journals. During the suffragette madness
Lawrence was understood to have done his
bit at window-smashing in Bond-street under
orders from his wife, who is one of the
founders of the AVomen’s Social and Political
Union. He is a good talker, a capable
journalist, and, like many more of his kid-
ney, a man of considerable wealth.
Amos Burr, head of Vic. Hansard staff,
is retiring because he is 65. He joined 23
years ago, after a gruelling spell of daily
press work, and never have things worked so
smoothly as during the eight years he has
been chief. Unlike Loughran, his prede-
cessor, he is not entitled to pension, but will
get some leave. Feeling and looking much
younger than his years, he will return to
journalism in Melbourne.
Judge Burnside has been induced to go
back to the Arbitration Court in W.A. ; he
is about the only Judge who ever sat there
without having his impartiality questioned
and liis blood howled for by discontented
industrialists. But this particular Honor
has always been viewed with rather a kindly
eye by the Trades Hall, partly, perhaps,
because he once remarked that whenever
there was an outcry from the unions over
one of his awards he took it as prima
facie evidence that it was faulty. Also, the
atmosphere in the court has been more
homely and less academic under him, he
being a garrulous old gent, always ready to
let litigants yarn about anything, relevant
or otherwise, and exercising the same right
on his own behalf. Withal, lie is extremely
conscientious. A dozen years ago, after
hearing all sorts of conflicting opinions about
the cost of living, he determined to ascertain
for himself how much a man could exist on
in Perth in reasonable comfort. He pro-
ceeded to keep a strict account of his house-
hold and personal expenses for three months.
The tucker-bill was on the frugal side, and
it is still remembered how persistently hari-
cot beans figured on the judicial table.
“Cheezo”: I haven’t heard the whisper
regarding Patrick Hartigan (B. 6/12/’23)
as successor to the late Dr. Gallagher at
Goulburn (N.S.W.), but I’ll plump for Mon-
signor McGuire, of Lismore, as the next
bishop. There was talk of making him
coadjutor-bishop, but Dr. Gallagher expressed
a desire to take the final call in harness,
and the matter dropped.
The Last Post lias sounded at Tauranga
1 M.L.) for Capt. Gilbert Mail-, who was
born at Wliangarei 80 years ago. He and
liis brother. Major William Mair, saw most
of the fighting against the Maoris, and it
was his contingent that defeated Te Kooti.
In that battle he, single-handed, killed two
stalwarts, Patara and Wi Ileretauuga, and
suDsequently gained the N.Z. Cross. For
some years Gilbert Mair was Native Inter-
preter in the House, and was a mine of infor-
mation on Hori's customs and folklore.
G. F. Bridgman, who died in Bananaland
the other day at 81, knew pretty well all
that it is given a white man to know about
Binghi. his customs, habits and language. In
the old days he was, in turn, manager of
I ort Cooper and Homebusli stations, official
interpreter in N.Q. and officer-in-cliarge of
the Aboriginal Reserve near Mackay.
on he became a partner in a combined sugar
plantation and pastoral station, and con-
tinued to make a success of it till 1907, when
he went to the Darling Downs to try his
hand at
Still another Australian steps into the
limelight oversea——Dr. Una Fielding, who
graduated in medicine from Sydney last year,
having previously done a brilliant course in
arts. She resigned from the staff of the
Children’s Hospital, left Australia a few
months ago, and has now been appointed
acting-demonstrator in anatomy and his-
tology at the University of London, where
she is engaged in research work. She has
also been invited by Grafton Elliot Smith
to help him with the illustrations of his new
textbook on anatomy. The brainy young
lady is a daughter of warrior-parson Field-
ing, of St. Matthias’, Paddington.
Col. Light, first Surveyor-General of S.A.
and the man who decided where the capital
should be, was solemnly toasted a few days
ago from a silver bowl which was presented
to Adelaide for that express purpose in
1859 by some of the English theorists who
a .quarter of a century before had founded
the new southern State on paper before it
ever existed in reality. Mayor Glover read
Light s justification of himself in bis Jour-
nal—he had met with much opposition from
Governor Hindmarsh and others, who had
a fancy for Kangaroo Island or Port Lin-
coln :
■ Tb® reas °ns that led me to fix Adelaide where it
is 1 do not expect to be generally understood or
calmly judged of at present. My enemies, however,
by disputing their validity in every particular, have
"° n f. ™ e the good service of fixing the whole respon-
sibility upon me. I am perfectly willing to bear
it; and I leave it to posterity, and not to them, to
decide whether I am entitled to praise or to blame.
The city, by the way, was within an inch
of being called Wellington. George IV.,
who was dead six months later, lived just
long enough to have it named after his
queen.
“T. 0.1.” : The late Humphrey Oxenham, who
was born at Wattle. Flat, near Sofala(N.S.W),
70 years ago, was living in Bathurst with
lus parents when he got his first lift. For
a wager of £lO he carried an enormoui
pumpkin on his head, without hand help,
from the Duke’s Hotel, Bathurst, to the
Melbourne Hotel at Kelso—over a mile and
a half. The steady walker, having won his
wager, almost immediately migrated to Syd-
ney, where generations of punters saw to it
that he didn’t lack a crust.
Joined the drift to the city, Duncan
McFarlane, who lias lived at Grafton
(N.S.W.) for more
than 60 years.
Though over 70, he
can drive a car,
and in spite of the
fact that he was a
working journalist
for 35 years, he
has a car of his
own to drive.
McFarlane was
Mayor of Grafton
for ages, and presi-
dent of most things
in the sleepy city
for half a century.
Taking to bowls
when he was over
60, he was cham-
pion of his club
for three years,
and he played
cricket up that
way for 40 conse-
cutive seasons.
H. P. BROWN,
late of London,
the new head in
the Common-
wealth’s Post and
Telegraph services.
Dr. George Eric Mackay, of Bendigo, who
has died of t.b. in Dublin, was only 2(5, and
got into khaki before he was 18. He was a
contemporary of Gerald Patterson at Scotch
College, Melbourne, and was in the school
tennis four. Just before his death he caused
a sensation in Dublin by winning the Irish
championship. A little earlier, at Folkestone,
lie had collected the scalps of two English
Davis Cuppers, Mavrogordato and Wheatley,
and also defeated Campbell, the Irish star,
who was the only player to win a set from
the American Johnston in the Wimbledon
tournament. Dr. Mackay, who lost his only
brother, Major Murdoch Mackay, in the war,
was after the F.R.C.S. in Dublin when the
end came. Ilis wife, whom he married last
year, is a daughter of W. 11. Waddell, the
Melbourne printer.
A. J. Thynne has just finished a half-cen-
tury of six-and-eighting in Brisbane. And
he was in the public service for a while be-
fore he ventured on the law. Yet he is still
so young that last year he married an attrac-
tive widow —and doesn’t seem to have had a
care since. If lie didn’t have so much law
work to do he might write a most interesting
story: he was Thomas Mcllwraith’s Attor-
ney-General close on to 40 years ago, and has
been at the very heart of Queensland’s public
life ever since.
Mieheal Louis, who has just used up four
days of the N.S.W. Divorce Judge’s time
in successfully fighting his wife's petition for
freedom on the grounds of cruelty, was told
at the outset that he had an income ol
£7OOO a year, and he let it go at that, though
lie would be much surprised if the Income
Tax people would lot it go at that too.
Thirty years ago he, a young Polish Jew,
came this way via America, and began life
as a basket-hawker. He got a cart presently,
then a country store; next he began buying-
bits of dead-wool, and so he went on until
he was able to deal in stations. A long-
headed, garrulous little man is Louis —which,
incidentally, wasn’t his name before he left
Russia. When the war started he saw
that there was going to be trouble in shift-
ing money from one country to another, and
that the man who could make foreign pay-
ments would reap a rich harvest. That was
when _ Louis thought of diamonds, and foi*
a while he was the most active diamond
dealer in Australia.

Sons of a school-inspector, the elder has
been coadjutor-bishop and bishop in the
coalfields district for a quarter of a century,
and is the Commonwealth’s R.C. authority
on ecclesiastical ceremonial, while the youn-
ger has worn purple on his chest for half a
dozen years.
James Carson, whose sun set the other
day near Cowper (N.S.W.), had held a
spiritual pilot’s ticket for 61 years.
Mayor Thompson, of Quorn (S.A.), is out
after a civic record. He has held the job for
22 years, and has just been re-elected with-
out opposition for another term.
SPLODGES ON THE SAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As I stroll along- the bay-front on these fragrant
Springtide nights,
I love the ghostly ripples and the far, reflected
lights ;
I love the ti-tree rustlings and the distant Palais
band,
But what attracts me mostly are the splodges on
the sand.
I am not a peeping Thomas, so of course I never
halt
When 1 see these lumps of blackness; yet I reckon
it no fault
If 1 fall a-cogitating—for they are on every hand
On the whyness and the wherefores of those splodges
on the sand.
1* rom the factory, shop and office —drawn perhaps by
Springtide’s charm —
A girlie from “the millin’ry,” a fellow from a farm ;
fioni sordid streets and gentle homes, each station
in the land,
Come the couples who at evening make those splodges
on the sand.
Everywhere I blunder by them ; it's no use to try
to dodge.
Every corner of the beaches seems to harbor its own
splodge.
So I simply must keep strolling—it would never de
to stand
In a mean and narking nearness to a splodge upon
the sand.
Each a huddled heap of snuguess caring not for any-
thing
Save the kisses and the blisses that the fleeting
moments bring;
It is easy to imagine that the business now on hand
Is of very private nature for those splodges on the
sand.
"hat, brave words are said in secret when the moon
is hanging low
What sighs are sighed, what lies are lied is not for
me to know.
I pass on to the Esplanade, where 1 can hear the
band,
Itegaidful of the feelings of all splodges on the sand.
Ah, me! twas not so long ago I, too, was young
enough
To visit, in picked company, St. Kilda by the Bluff !
Ah, Youth, on sweet Spring evenings may your joys
be never banned —
I remember when I helped to make such splodges
on the sand i
So on my lonely walks abroad I go with furtive eye;
And as I gently hurry past none hear an old man
sigh.
Eor I think in spite of wowsers that the future of
our land
Is quite safely in the keeping of its splodges on the
sand.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
“King Kurrajong”; A while back some-
one was claiming that the biggest dingoes were to
be found in Northern and Central Queensland, and
added parenthetically that they were “really ali
crossbreds,” and therefore wild dogs. As a matter
of fact, Vic. breeds the biggest wild dogs in Aus-
tralia, possibly in the world. These devils are to
be found in the wild mountain country behind Bright,
in the Alps, immediately surrounding Mt. Hothain
(“Baldy”) and the Dargo high plains. The giant
streak was bred into them by a number of St. Ber-
nards that went bush from the hospice on the
mountain of that name.
* * * *
“Bora” : Bill and I had the job of bring-
ing the new cook from the railway at Bourke to the
station, about 50 miles out, in the boss’s Ford.
After doing 30 miles or so with the temperature
well over the 100 mark, we pulled the car up for
a blow. “By Jove,” remarked Bill, “she smells
hot.” “Yea,” snapped her Domestic ’lghness, “and
if you’d been travelling for two days and nights
without a wash you’d smell ’ot too!” To her
dying day that cook will swear that two Western
jackeroos were not gentlemen.
“748”: Re the toughness
of cats as compared with dogs
(B. 8/11/’23). Some months ago
a puss was sighted near our camp
with a tin tightly fixed on his
head. Repeated attempts were
made to capture him, but a fort-
night wore away before we suc-
ceeded in getting our hands on
the animal. Even then it took
two of us to hold him, while
another separated him from his
hat. He made a beeline for the
creek *as soon as released, and
has been in good form ever since.
During the fortnight in which
he was doing the Ned Kelly act
it was utterly impossible for him
to have had either food or drink.
“Geo. Rich”: A bushman
who actually witnessed the birth
of a marsupial in south W.A. dis-
agrees with part of A. S. le
Souef’s “true bill No. 3” (B.
25/10/’23). His affidavit made
on the birth-registration paper is:
“The ’roo when born is a helpless
bit of unsightly flesh with tightly
closed paws. Its arms incline,
paws upward, and appear glued
to its body. It can’t climb into
the nursery, for the obvious
reason that it hasn’t the power to
do so. Ma lifts the diminutive
infant up with her lips and de-
posits it in the cradle.” This
bushman’s version agrees with
that of an old Westralian abo. of
my acquaintance who has stoou
by ma ’roo in several maternity
cases.
“Imlay”: The latest news from Eden
(N.S.W.) is that the killers, who used to run the
whales into Twofold Bay and hold them while they
sent a messenger to fetch the whalers out,, have held
a stbpwork meeting. They reckon that the least
their dry-land relations can do is to kill the
whales after they have been rounded up, and a poor
fist has been made of it lately. A recent case when
the boat was upset in the excitement, and the whale
got clean away after a lot of messing about, was
pretty well the last straw.
* * * *
“Archbell” : I was at Rheola, an old Vic.
mining-place, the other day, and the pub-keeper
there showed me a long-disused shaft about 12ft.
deep with a small drive at the bottom. Also at the
bottom is a large brown snake, which Bung swears
he first saw there in 1913. What does that wriggler
live on, as he cannot get out of his trap, which
he must have managed to fall into? I wanted to
drop a lump of rock on him, but Bung wouldn’t
let me—he reckons he wants to see how much longer
the poor creature will live.

“ Mother, am I descended from a monkey?”
“I couldn’t tell you, my dear. I never knew any of your father’s people.”
“Bad Australian” : A Sydney weekly, deal-
ing with the' record of the elusive Buckley, compares
the suspect to “a wombat in a hollow log.” Every
bushman knows that if there is one thing in the
whole cosmic scheme that the wombat has an
implacable objection to it, is that same hollow log.
He has a vivid appreciation of the fact that
it is the habitat of a pestilent assortment of bugs,
beetles, centipedes, scorpions and spiders, with an
occasional snake or goanna to add to the warmth
of the intruder’s reception, and he has a lurking
suspicion that he might—given the proper kind of
l°g—find a very snappy dingo slut and her brood of
potential sheep-killers in residence. There is nothing
in the wombat’s class as an excavator except a
steam shovel, and he will rake out a comfortable
and perfectly fitting shelter in considerably less
time than his limited mental capacity would enable
him to take an inventory of the topography and
fauna of the log. If the simple annalist of the
house of Buckley doubts this, let him give a healthy
adult ’bat 33.3 seconds start on an alluvial flat or
in decomposed basalt country and try to dig him
out.
* * * *
‘‘Jimmy Possum” : I’m with “Pick” when,
he says (B. l/11/’23) sheep will follow any leader.
A while back a neighbor got hold of a young jum-
buck, which he penned up every; evening with the
poddies. He became :?o attached to the calves that
he followed them about everywhere. Then one
day the young hornies had to be dipped, and as
Billy was likely to be a nuisance he was locked up
in the pen. The trek for the distant dip had
hardly begun when Bill, with a piteous bleat,
scrambled over the calf-pen gate and joined his
comrades. At the dip an attempt was made to
cut him off as the calves were being run through;
but he rushed to the edge, stood on his hind legs,
gave a plaintive baa and a frantic bound, and
landed with a tremendous splash almost half-way
across the dip; then he lost no time in joining his
mates. Thereafter he followed regularly on dip-
ping day, always taking- his plunge with his poddy
pals.
* * * •*
“Nitric”: Bananaland has its Loafers’
Paradise Act, but there are a few who don’t take
advantage thereof. A man out of a job tramped
across country from Nanango (S.Q.) to Yarraman
Creek, only a matter of 20 miles, and no distance
to hump bluey; but he did it with a wife and two
children, aged eight and five respectively. On
arrival at the “crick” the woman and infants were
taken care of by kind inhabitants, while dad joined
up at the sawmill. Isn’t this about a record for
youthful on-the-wallabying ?
* * * *
A triple indictment:—
“Aitchen”: Because four parent birds supposedly
gathered 1440 grubs in a day, “Centre” infers that
the starling does more good than harm (B.
22/11/’23). If he saw the bird at work in the
grape country during the ripening season, he would
soon change his opinion. In the Kyabram district
(Vic.) men are engaged to walk up and down the
rows of vines all day shooting at the flocks as soon
as thev settle, thus keeping them moving. Yet,
notwithstanding all their vigilance, growers iose
thousands of pounds worth of fruit annually.
“Tarago”: It is only of recent years that the
starling invaded the Vic. country districts; and
before his advent nobody s-eemed to notice that the
cocky suffered unduly from grubs. On the other hand,
the district from which 1 write (Gippsland) was
invaded by a plague of caterpillars which devastated
root and cereal crops, while the starling gave his
undivided attention to the orchards. The abuse of
this bird is not misplaced, and at the present rate
of increase the imported waster is destined to rival
the rabbit as a damned nuisance—with this difference,
that he has no commercial value when he’s dead.
“580”; On this (Griffith) section of the Murrum-
bidgee irrigation area there is no greater pest than
the starling from January till April. They come in
flocks of thousands and work destruction on any
unguarded vineyards w'here the grapes are ripening.
They appear soon after sunrise and within a couple
of hours will destroy the potential harvest of a
year’s labor. They are particularly fond of brown
muscats (Frontignac), but all varieties pf grapes
suffer during the season. Some settlers spend pounds
on ammunition to scare them off, but they return time
after time. The birds may live on grubs and insects
during the rest of the year, but that is offset by
the damage they do when they get the chance.
“El Dorado” : The other night I heard my
mate laughing to himself after rolling in. Asked
the reason, he told me that during the evening he
had been to a Binghi’s banquet, which consisted
of an emu, roasted whole, and damper; and it was
the damper part of it that was tickling him in retro-
spect. After the emu had been polished off he
jokingly inquired of Binghi where the “johnny” was.
“Thad one feller all right,” replied the nig; “dog
him bin watchem. I bin go fetchem now.” He
walked about 20yds. from the fire, and there was
a damper, the size of a small doormat, as hard as
the proverbial hobs, with a kangaroo slut curled up
on top of it keeping guard. “That one blurry good
watch-dog,” commented Binghi, as he humped the
fearsome-looking mass back to the fire.
ADVICE WANTED.
MAGISTRATE: “It seems to me that this is
a case which might very well have been
settled out of court.”
ACOUSED: “Too true, yer Ronner! But
what’s a bloke to do if the other cove
won’t fight?”
“D.F.” : As Bernard Cronin lived for some
years at Marrawah, or somewhere out that way in
the far west of the Speck, his local color ought to
be all right; but is it a true bill when in “Salvage’’
he talks about mangroves away down the coast to-
wards the Pieman River? I could have sworn that
mangroves did not grow south of Bass Straits. But
it does not do to be too certain about these things.
Some years ago a surveyor found, away back in the
bush near the Arthur River, a single bush of the
mainland Pittosporum undulatum. According to
Leonard Rodway, the Speck’s official botanist, it is
the only specimen known to have been found wild in
Tasmania, and there is no reason to suppose that
it was introduced there by human agency.

THE VAGRANTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The road-rangers had been busy, they had ridden
far and wide,
And a motley herd were driven to the pound
Worn-out hacks and useless roadsters turned adrift
to take their chance;
A sprinkling, too, of young ones that were sound.
There were some that had been branded from the
shoulder to the ‘ rump
(The kind of horse that’s always changing hands).
There were blotches, stars and circles and the letters
A to Z;
And one or two bore well-known station brands.
Creamies, piebalds, bays and chestnuts, iron-greys
and brown and black;
A few of them would never leave the pound—
They were things of bone and sinew, and their feet
were worn and blunt
Where, weakly, they had dragged them on the
ground.
And some of them when rolling floundered sadly as
they rose
And some had drooping ears or sagging lip ;
But one old mare was caring for a foal that she
was rearing,
And one had lost the angle of his hip.
There was one, a creamy gelding, that had backed
up to the rails;
His sides were scarred and ruffled with the spurs ;
He was saddle-marked and girth-galled and his tail
was docked and cobbed
And his forelock was a mat of Bathurst burrs.
His legs were straight and stately and his hoofs
were finely knit—
The kind we see on horses mountain bred—
His old sunken eyes shone brightly and his ears were
closely set;
I liked the game old way he held his head.
OTHERWISE HE MIGHT.
THE LAW: “You’d letter take the next tram home.”
THE OTHER : “Inshooperable — hie — obsthickle, ole fller.
My — hie—wife wouldn’t let me keep such a—
hie —thing in the ’ousel”
There was one, a faded beauty, that looked like a
lady’s hack.
His tail was banged and hanging like a broom;
One could see that he’d been pampered ere misfortune
came his way
And sadly missed his stable and his groom.
Though his hip-bones were like hatracks and his hair
stood up on end,
No scar or cut or blemish marred his hide;
And his neck still arched a little as he trotted round
« the yard
And his mane was straight and even at the side.
Two old Clydesdales, gaunt and hairy, stood watching
patiently—
Their ribs were chafed and callous from the
chains,
And their feet were flat and sprawling, for they
never needed shoes
On the soft unmetalled roads that cross ch?
plains.
They were bare across the withers, collar-worn and
nearly blind,
Hollow-backed from heavy weights of many loads ;
Their great heads hung low and listless, as if dream-
ing of the past
When grass was green and waving by the roads.
Snorting weakly in a corner stood an equine
skeleton,
An outlaw from a station or a show —
His nostrils were distended and his eyes were
rimmed with white,
He was broken-kneed and had a pigeon toe.
With a shaking at the shoulder and a trembling
at the flank,
His tail jambed down in anger or in fear,
One hind foot was quickly lifted and his ragged
ears flew back
When anyone on foot was passing near.
All were pinched with bitter hunger and some
nibbled at the rails;
A few were idly walking round and round —
Ladies’ hacks and drovers’ horses, racing cracks
of better days,
All herded with the vagrants in the pound!
If no owner comes to claim them, there will be an
auction sale,
And lucky will they be that find a friend ;
But the crows will have a banquet as they go down
one by one,
Or piggeries will get them in the end !

THE DIFFERENCE IS IN THE PLATES
Greater Efficiency and Double the Life
THE reasons for the longer life that is obtained from the Tudor Battery with
House- and Farm-lighting Sets are found in the Plates.
The Tudor Positive Plate is the Plante type. It is a solid casting of pure lead
on which the active material is formed by an electro-chemical process.
The active material is part and parcel of the plate.— not a foreign substance pressed
into an open grid.
The Tudor Negative Plate is the Box type, consisting of a number of separate
compartments which contain the active material. Shedding of negative active material is
prevented by perforated sheet-lead envelopes which cover both sides of the plate.
The plates of the Tudor Accumulator for House- and Farm-lighting Sets are the same
type and design as the plates of the largest batteries built by the Tudor Accumulator
Co. for Central Station and Electric Tramway Service.
The first cost of a Tudor Battery for House-lighting Service may be slightly higher
than the first cost of other less suitable batteries, but when estimated in life and service
the Tudor is by far the cheapest battery to install.
The TUDOR PLANTE TYPE BATTERY is

“Sucre” : A kangaroo drilled by a bullet at
Hughenden (Q.) the other day opened out 9ft.
lOin. of measuring tape at his inquest. He was ot
the Red family. The actual length of pelt was Bft.
IOJi-n. Has any Abo. got a few inches to spare over
a similar corpse ?
“Hori”: I’m with “Jim Domino” (B.
22/11/’23) when he says that as a general thing
the station night-horse is not kept without feed.
If “Lou” (B. l/11/’23) has any sympathy to
squander, he should lavish it on the cattle-drovers’
night horses, which, when not taking their turn on
watch, are tied up—and some of them are not even
provided with a bag of grass to munch between
watches. They are usually picked horses, sure of
foot, with a dash of pace, and preferably not too
nervous. When the cattle are bad they have a gruel-
ling night; immediately afterwards they are driven
10 or 12 miles, as the case may be, to the next
night’s camp, and in the afternoon their leisure is
again interrupted by a drive to the nearest water—•
anything up to three miles away. If the night-
horse is a bad camper he spends all his spare
time in hobbles, and I knew one that became „-o
weary from his leg-irons that he would try to lie
down with you if you let him stand still for a
few minutes when on watch. Although drovers’
night-horses work only every second or third night,
the average prad will crack up quicker on this
than on any other.
THE BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE.
“Why didn’t you take on that job of ring-larking up
at Gundarimba?”
"Mine tinkit too much movin’ about no good to the
furniture.”
Bad Australian”: Whoever may have
been the first white man to record a description of
the kangaroo, it. seems tolerably certain that the
Aru Island wallabies seen living in the Dutch Gover-
nor s garden at Batavia in 1711 by Bruvn were the
first specimens of the family actually known to
Europeans*
A MOST VERSATILE YOUTH.
MANAGES: “Is he good at figures?”
MOTHER: “Good, sir? Why, he can count a column of figures six times and get six
different answers.”
“Ngatuwera” (M.L.) : “D.J.B.’s” par. (B.
15/11/’23) re the Australian aborigine’s childlike
faith in the police reminds me of the mysterious
properties the Maoris attributed to the theodolite, or
taipo (devil), in the early surveying days. Hori had
a sack of potatoes to sell, but insisted on selling them
in the pakeha. fashion, by the lb. No scales were
available, and the surveyor questioned Hori as to
how he was to weigh them. “Ivapai te taipo” was
the reply, and the chance of cheap vegetables
quickly dawned on the transit-squinter. He adjusted
the instrument, took several bearings of the sack,
worked it all out in his notebook, and replied:
“By cracky, that heavy sack, Hori—=-421b.” The
figure, unquestioningly accepted, secured him new
potatoes at a ha’penny a lb.
* * * *
“S.E.M.”: I never tried baking bread in
the ashes, but I can tell “Condamine” (B. 18/10/’23)
that one of the best bakeries is a good-sized white-
ant nest. Make a square or arched hole near the
bottom, big enough to allow the loaf to slip in, and
scoop all the centre out with a shovel. About 6in.
from the top on the opposite side make a hole (large
enough to insert half a brick rolled in a wet bag) to
act as a flue. Keep a good fire going in the ant-
hill for an hour; then, having let it burn down to
coals, scrape them all out, pop in your loaf, either in
a tin or on a sheet of paper, stop up the flue with
your brick-rolled-in-a-wet-bag, a nd close the big open-
ing with a flat board, (put a wet bag - over it), prop-
ping the board up with a good hunk of wood. I
guarantee that bread baked in this oven will be
sweeter than any made in st camp-oven or a stove.
“Wessel”: There are several very curious
likenesses, some negative and some positive, between
the abos. of Melville Island (N.T.)
and the now-extinct aborigines of
Tasmania., Neither of them, for in-
tance, used either the boomerang or
the womera, both of which are almost
universal on the continent itself. Some
of the customs and beliefs of the Mel-
ville Islanders seem more akin to
what we know of the Tasmanians —
which is not very much —than to the
customs and creeds of the mainland.
This lends support to the theory that
people of the Tasmanian type once
occupied the whole of Australia, but
' were exterminated or absorbed by in-
vading tribes and survived only on
those islands at the opposite extremi-
ties of the continent.
* * *
“Moe”: A firm belief among
some bush-dwellers is that rain may
be foretold by changes in the color of
the foliage of trees, particularly of
the small, shrub-like varieties. They
say that leaves which during a dry
spell are a light and bright green
turn a darker shade when a fall of
rain is at hand, and at the same time
the leaf-tissue loses its brittleness and
becomes more spongy. No doubt there
is something in this, for the foliage
of many trees possesses hygroscopic
properties, and is capable of absorb-
ing moisture from the atmosphere,
wnich would account for the change
in color. Three times lately I have
seen this theory put to the test, and
each time it : proved to be correct,
though in one case as long as .’2
hours elapsed before rain fell.
“Larry Longun”: “Cobba Cobba” (R.
l/11/’23) notwithstanding, it is generally agreed
among sugar-growers that too liberal a ration of
mo’asses is injurious to horses, making them short-
winded. I have known several cases in which
plantation prads had to be “passed on” owing to
becoming too blowy for heavy, constant work, a
condition attributed to too much “black Jack.”
Neddies tuckered on treacle usually develop dental
trouble early, and I have known many such animals
to have lost all their front teeth at 16 years old.
A further volley :
. “G.8.R.”: “Jimmy Possum’s” doubts about shoot-
ing from horseback (B. 15/11/’23) remind me of an
incident in the Boer War. Once when, we surprised
a laager in the Maghaliesburg ranges, a young Dop-
per jumped on a horse without saddle* or bridle
and made off at a gallop. It was fine riding; but
his flashness was his downfall. When he thought he
was clear away he turned and placed his thumb to
his nose. This taunt riled our men, and Billy
McPhee, a trooper in McKenzie’s Scouts and a
man with a reputation as a crack kangaroo-shoote’',
raced after him. He got within about 500yds. of
the flying Boer ; then he propped his horse and took
aim. At that instant, when only a few chains lay
between him and the cover of the hills, the fugitive
turned and again put his finger to his nose. Oracle
went McPhee’s rifle, up went the Boer’s hands, and
he pitched headlong to the ground. He was shot
through the side, the bullet piercing his lungs. It
may have been a fluke, but it was a great shot. As
a. matter of fact, there was a fair amount of man-
shooting from the saddle in the S’African war. At
Brackenlaagte Delarey’s men raced up in a blinding
storm and shot the gunners as they served the 15-
pounders. They practically went at full gallop in
a circle, and kept shooting until the battery was
put out of action and captured. Although they
missed their man • occasionally thej' got more hits
than misses, and only about three men of the whole
battery escaped the Mauser bullets.
“Dante”: I know a full-blooded lubra at
White Wells, a part of George Murray s
Yalcha station, Fowlefl’s Bay (S.A.), who
tracks and shoots dingoes with rifle from a moving
horse, bareback. Incidentally, her husband, George
Lambert, a fifty-fifty abo., is the finest specimen of
a man I’ve ever met. He stands 6ft. and has a
normal chest measurement of 45 inches.
“Bynoe”: Some years ago, in the Gulf, I was
yarding a killer. It being a typical summer day and
there being some difficulty with the yarding, the
beast got over-heated and consequently went mad;
but she was not quite as mad as I was. While
galloping- to heel her, I fired, killed the beast, singed
the horse’s ear, fell off and broke the rifle. In ordi-
nary circumstances I could kill a beast in a crush
in 14 shots —at any rate I made it a practice never
to exceed that number, for I considered my reputa-
tion as a shot was at stake. I always pithed them
after the 14th.
“Bora”: I won’t argue the point with “Jimmy
Possum” about shooting from horseback, but I can
name him a prominent Newcastle (N.S.W.) business
man who shoots' rabbits with a .22 pea rifle from
his car when it’s in motion.
“8.V.E.”: In backing up the remarks of
“Saaedi” (B. 22/11/’23) re the handling and break-
ing of young horses, I’d like to quote the gospel
of old Syd Storrer, a horse-handler I knew well in
C.-W. Queensland: “Never let a young ’un know
that ’e can buck. Handle ’im plenty and gently.
Make ’im know ’nd like yer. Don’t be in a ’urry
ter put ther tacklin’ on till he’s used to yer. This
’ere gettin’ on a norse too quick ’nd ridin’ ’im to
a standstill is ivhat spoils ’nd ruins ’im. I’ve broke
nigh on seven thousand prads in my time ’r.d
ain’t never rode a buck yet. An’ what’s more,
I don’t want to.”
“Gung”: “Booral” (B. 22/11/’23) asks
what his poodle was at when, it was apparently
playing with a snake, and neither was making any
effort to attack. There was no play about it—each
was, while intently watching and guarding against
the movements of the other, sparring for a favor-
able opening to get in for a death grip. Invariably
the knowing dog will fight a snake this way. He
cavorts around, missing every strike from the
squirmer by fractions of an inch, until the oppor-
tunity comes, and then, seizing Long-un with his
teeth, shakes him too furiously to admit of a return
bite coming his way. On the other hand, a blunder-
ing tyke will rush straight in at the snake, and
often the funeral of both is on the morrow.
“Bouragi” : I take off my hat to “Tabak’s”
Papuan cookboy (B. 22/11/’23) who walked 30
miles over a 3000 ft. range in 12 hours and returned
next day in 10 hours. The world’s record for a
12-hour walk, before this astonishing cookie's per-
formance, was 73 miles 145 yards, put up by
E. S. Horton, of England, in 1914. The white
man had the advantages of a prepared track, spiked
shoes and refreshment en route , while the walk, of
course, was on the level, wherein it seems ro
differ from that of “Tabak’s” cook. On second
thoughts I take off my hat to “Tabak” too.
S.ome more about brumbies: —
In his remarks about Will Ogilvie
and the genesis of the brumby, “Jarrah” (B.
22/11/’23) puts himself a little out of court, in
saying that the breed of the wild horse of the
south-west of W.A. “is quite distinct from me
Timor ponies which were introduced to Northern
Westralia by William Dampier.” Dampier lirst
looked in on the N.-W. coast at the end of the 17th
century in the pirate ship Cygnet, and his minute
and detailed journal makes no mention of any horse-
flesh landed on that occasion. A dozen years later
he was there again for a few weeks, in command of
H.M.S. Roebuck, which period he spent in an un-
availing search for sorely-needed water, ere he
departed for Timor, cursing the inhospitality of the
coast and the elusiveness of local binghis. He cer-
tainly did not put any Timor ponies ashore then, as
he had come direct from England via South America.
I happen to know this, because I once perpetrated
a small “Life of William Dampier,” and had ro
study the old buccaneer and sometime naval officer’s
records pretty thoroughly in the process of compiling
the little book.
“FY7”: “Jarrah” and others notwithstanding, the
horse is not indigenous to Australia, but beyond all
doubt was introduced by the First Fleet. The many
stories by early explorers in all parts of Australia
of the alarm and astonishment shown by the abos.
at their first meeting with horses should be proof
enough that the moke is an importation. The late
John Forrest refers to this in one of his journals,
and that disposes of “Jarrah’s” claim for a special
breed of Westralian horse. As to the brumbies’
rapid spread and increase, the horses imported by the
Spaniards to Central America spread nearly all over
two great continents in 150 years or less.
“L.D.1.”: I support “F.A.’s” contention (B.
15/11/ 23) that the wild horses which were so numer-
ous in the ’seventies along the Lachlan (N.S.W.)
originally came down that river from the earlv
settled districts about Bathurst. At least that was
the supposition there about 40 years back. When
Cowl Cowl was divided and the Gunbar half of it
a handy little block of half a million acres—was
bought by Cumining and Armstrong in ’75 it was
estimated that there were over 3000 brumbies on
it; and I have seen in the old station books that
in the years i 5 and ’l6 about 1800 of these were
paid for as being shot, the shooters getting 4s. a
head and the hides. I have seen some of the trap-
A BUSH CHRISTENING.

enough for one man just to be Gover-
nor.”
yards mentioned by “F.A.” and some good horses
that were saved out of mobs yarded. Incidentally,
“F.A.” is, I think, slightly in error as to the names
oi his pioneers. There were two or three brothers
named Blake (not Lake) who lived about Booligai
in those times, and I remember hearing fascinating
tales of their horsemanship. These men, with the
Hemphills and Johnny Gray, were known as “brumby
runners.” The wire fences settled the brumbies —
they soon grew so frightened of them that a few
posts and one wire would keep them away from a
waterhole —and their range being restricted, “when the
“paddocks,” or 10-mile blocks into which the runs
were first divided, were fenced, they were soon
disposed of, the last few in that locality dying out
in the ’B4 drought. By the way, it was said that
the first wire fence erected north of the Murrurn-
bidgee (or Murray either, I suppose) was on Illila-
wah, near Hay, where they so fenced a paddock
round the head station to keep their own horses in
and the brumbies out. That was about ’65 ; and the
wire was brought by bullock-team right from Mel-
bourne.
“Larry Longun”: I don’t know anything about the
parents of the original brumbies, but I do know
that some of the wild horses I have seen and ridden
had every appearance of being thoroughbreds. These
particular animals were run down in the hilly country
of the Upper Burnett (Q.), and were probably the
offspring of pedigreed stock gone bush. None of the
old hands I have met have ever regarded wild horses
as being indigenous ; and anyone knowing the habits
of horses can easily understand how there came
to be brumbies. I own two now, the progeny of a
blood mare which was allowed to run out one dry
spell a few years back. They have defied the
repeated efforts of some of the best horsemen in
the district to yard or run them down. As one is
a filly, I dare say I shall have a herd of them some
day.
THE CALL OF HOME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I shall be glad to hear the laugh of the kooka-
burra again. The song of the nightingale is very
sweet if you wait up till 11 o’clock to hear it, but
give me the magpie and the jackass.”— N.S.tV.
Premier Fuller’s wife, on her return last week.
The blackbird whistled on the lawns ; we heard the
glad cuckoo
Impressing on the countryside his notes are only
two ;
The skylark’s shower of melody descended from the
blue.
The mellow ousel and the ’finch, from elm and
orchard bough,
Contributed their quota to the captivating row,
As Tennyson has chronicled and Browning tells you
how.
And tawny-throated Philomel provided nightly treats
For music-lovers who were not asleep between the
sheets,
To justify the eulogies of Arnold and of Keats.
Cloyed with the caramels of song from many a
feathered throat,
I’m feeling like a diner who is tired of table d’hbte
And pines for homely steak or chops by way of
antidote.
I’ve heard the throbbing nightingale, with pain and
passion torn ;
I’ve heard the linnet in the hedge, the landrail iu
the corn ;
I want to hear the magpie shrill his paean to the
morn.
I want to wake and know again, when dawn comes
soft and dim,
That boisterous reveille peal from off the gum-tree’s
limb,
That burst of wild hilarity which makes the ’hurra’s
hymn.
N.s.w.

Happy Holidays!
The festive season finds few motor cars idle, and many are the joyous reunions that
the motor makes possible and easier. The family gathering in city and country, the
happy house party away in the hills, and the seaside visit, are only a few of the calls
that will be made during the holidays—on car or motor cycle—owing to the un-
equalled facilities for speedy and comfortable travel. It’s a time when motorists are to
be envied. Free of trains, trams, etc., they can travel when and where they like. Away
at daybreak they can be a hundred miles away ere the summer heat makes one long
for shade and ease. It’s a time of the year when one, above all things desires freedom
from tyre troubles. The desire can be gratified by using the wonderfully dependable
mm cm ran
These tyres have won a fine reputation tor running thousands of miles without a cut
or a chip—free of puncture or “ blow-out.’’ That reputation is built up on the great
strength and thickness of cover, highest quality of materials and workmanship, and
the ability to “stand up” to hard work on rough roads. They represent maximum ser-
vice with economy and are far better value than any imported tyre on the market.
Compare prices—there’s no need to compare quality-for no better tyre is made than
the “ Dunlop.” Garages can supply in beaded or straight sided types in all sizes.

Prize-givings in the open are a blessing to
the fond but bored parent. When the
speeches become as desert sand in the ears of
the listener, Mother Nature can be depended
on to provide an armful of charm. The
Misses Roseby, of Ivambala, hit upon the al
fresco idea for their break-up with the hap-
piest results. Under the spreading trees on
the old lawn, with Rose Bay a misty blue
under the greying sky, garden chairs were
arranged fanwise, while on the wide, old-
fashioned verandahs such celebrities as Arch-
deacon D’Arcy Irvine, Premier George Puller,
Charles Rosenthal, the Wade lady and Frank
Lamb were enthroned.
St. Aloysius’s, at Milson’s Point, went fur-
ther and celebrated its end-of-the-year under
the stars. When the lights went down during
the scenes from “Henry V.” moths and
myriad winged things fluttered in a baffled
way towards the stage, set against the grey
background of the stone wall that divides
the tennis-courts from the higher terraces.
Trees black against the moonless night and
gaily beflagged walls added to the picturesque
setting.
Melba’s concert mid-way through last
week netted most of the stray guineas in
Sydney. The “vice-regal enclosure” was
thronged at the price, the words having a
hypnotic effect on this community even
when they relate merely to an acting-Gov-
ernor and his lady, who stand to attention
during the God Save. It was John Lem-
mone, his shining morning face a bit more
cherubic than usual, who wafted the little
party to the seats on the Axminster. Daugh-
ter Ailsa came with mother; and D’Apice
was the gentleman in attendance. Society
put in some strenuous palm exercise when
Prince Obolensky strolled on to the stage.
The Prince hides a good bit of himself be-
hind a barrage whose like has seldom been
seen under a singer’s nose. His build is
on the heavy side, and his basso, though
well managed and melodious in its middle
notes, is not a world-beater. While the audi-
ence was still giddy from its draughts of
Russian culture, Melba herself, looking as
burnished as a new penny, burst on the gaze,
and was greeted with a tornado of applause
that rocked the municipal hall. It was a
wonderful reception, and when the ushers,
led by a scarlet-clad girl, had piled the com-
plimentary vegetation at the singer’s feet,
the stage resembled an over-furnished bower.
There were the usual demands for encores,
and the evergreen “Home, Sweet Home,”
sung in the fresh voice of girlhood, and the
anti-climax of “Cornin’ Thro’ the Rye” (this
after the honey-sweet “Drink to Me Only
with Thine Eyes”)—a typical Melba con-
cert.
Premier Fuller’s lady, looking very hand-
some and fit after her travels, has been kept
busy shaking the political and merely human
glad-hand ever since her return. One after-
noon last week she repatriated herself at
the Women’s National Club—this is the
Eve rib of the Nationalist Adam, and here
the Premier’s lady is a sort of uncrowned
queen. The big room was crowded with
purring femininity, sleek in georgettes and
silk crepes. The guest of honor herself
flew a choice brand of Persian blue dr apings
topped by smart black millinery, with ospreys
that seemed to wave amiable agreement to
all the wearer sail about the blessedness of
being in Australia. Still you’ll observe that
it is only after an Australian Premier has
given his wife a good eight or 12 months’
travel in “foreign parts” that she sighs to
the voter: “To stay at home is best.”
If you’re in Pitt-street, look at the window
of Marcelle—there is something in it even
more thrilling than millinery this week. The
big front is full of made-in-Australia si.ks.
They come from the mills opened last year
by Governor Davidson in Chippendale, and
represent the first silk fabrics woven south of
the Line. There is imagination behind this
display; the evolution of the silk is shown
from the cocoon to the soft and shining
finished article turned out by the loom which
stands proudly in the centre foreground.
There’s a glowing luxury about these silks,
plain and figured, black and gay, coupled
with a soft richness, that the girl just
back from Europe declares would do high
credit to Lyons. Simon Hickey, whose
infant the industry is, ought to be a proud
father.
“The Hairy Ape” will be played for the
third and last time this season at the King’s
Hall on December 20; and it is more than
possible that the playwright himself will be
present at the performance. Anyway, a
Sydney friend has had word from him that
he was just setting out with the intention
of calling _in at Sydney before Christmas.
Eugene O’Neill’s father, a famous Ameri-
can actor, recently died, and the half-million
dollars or so which he made out of Monte
Cristo has descended to his son.
Maurice Whitaker, of the Apple isle, who
enriches the Commonwealth Bank service,
robbed Peter to pay Paul the other day,
when he lured Lottie Doughty from her desk
in the same banking house and gave her in
exchange a life job in home management.
Lottie is a tall, fair girl who duly met the
betrothal lOXT’s at St. James’s in a froth
of georgette that sprouted lilies of the valley
in its draperies. A bunch of attractive
young business women filled the pews with
the kind of millinery and frocking a duchess
would have envied, but probably wouldn’t
have the figure to wear. The newly-wed
Whitakers will live in Melbourne.
Zora Cross’s youngest sister, Mid, slipped
quietly into matrimony at St. James’s early
this week. The young man in the case is
Norman Somerville, of Adelaide. He’s a
8.A., and next year will take up a lecturing
job at the University.
Ethel Driver, demonstrator-in-chief of the
Dalcroze Eurhythmies, arrived in Sydney the
other day, in company with Cecilia John,
who is also an enthusiast and a certificated
teacher in the art of producing beauty of
movement. The two visitors intend, with the
aid of Mary Whidborne, who teaches rhythms
at Frensham, and Rachel Lowers, to give a
demonstration of the master's methods at the
Conservatorium on the 21st. An interesting
bit of the programme will be provided by a
group of small children, who will have their
first lesson in eurhythmies in view of the
audience. Later on the two go to Melbourne
to a summer school at the Teachers’ Train-
ing College. The student here is excited
over the scholarship, valued at £235, offered
by the London School to an Australian-born
woman of 20 or upwards.
Muriel Fletcher, who makes the track easy
for small musical wayfarers, gave a party
at the Rendezvous on Saturday to her pupils
and their mothers. Before the cakes and
ices were introduced, baby-girls and flappers
performed wonders at the keyboard, playing
Chopin and Lizst and such masters with a
precision of touch and a delicacy of expres-
sion that took the grown-ups’ breath away.
One small ball of pink organdies sat down
at the keyboard and rippled one number
after another, rather with the generous air
of giving her hostess a hand in making
things go.
A cheque for £2O or more is the present
the Outpost Kindergarten will pluck from
the Christmas-tree planted at St. James’s
last Friday afternoon. The tree was a
glittering magnificence; but the star of the
afternoon was story-man W. A. Thompson,
who had delved into the heart of Russian
folklore for an old-fashioned Christmas
story.

is a Queens-
lander who be-
ga n early:
when five
years old she
plucked
a prize for
elocution at
the Towns-
ville Eistedd-
fod. Before
coming to
Sydney she
lived in
Wagga, where
as a member of the Red Cross Concert Com-
pany she often appeared at six shows a
week. She has an extensive repertoire of
comic operas, and is at present studying
with “Billy” Beattie with intentions strictly
professional. “Billy” is the man who gave
Dolly Ilelmrich. basso Benham and Mar-
garet Bruce their lessons in the vocal art.
There is to be a kiddies’ party at the
Exhibition Building on the 19th. From 4
o’clock till 9 there will be continuous jazz,
with no end of prizes. Santa Claus has
promised to look in for an hour or so,
along with his old friends Punch and Judy.
Margaret Chalmers and Mrs. William
Arnott secretary the flutter, which is part
of the Prince Alfred drive.
The hole in the funds of the Little Citi-
zens’ kindergarten was neatly patched by
the gate-money from the Feminists’ show
at the Palace Theatre on Saturday night,
when a group of good-natured artists from
the Tivoli, Fuller’s and the J.C.W. com-
panies came along after their own turns to
raise their voices in song and story. So
the house of the pretty fancies takes on an-
other lease of life: and that in the arid
waste of Surry Hills is a thing to rejoice
over.
What a tangle! The still-attractive
though now fleshy Mrs. Louis, a German of
Silesia, who was last week’s divorce-court
star, formed an early liaison with an Aus-
trian, and she was with him in Palestine
or thereabouts when she met Louis, wdio is
a small Polish Jew. His wife was back in
Australia, in an asylum for the insane;
but there was some sort of a ceremony at
Antwerp, and the lady, who presently (so
her husband says) aspired to be “the best-
dressed woman in Sydney,” came on to Aus-
tralia and settled down with him. Later
on the wife who was “away” died ; and then
there was a real wedding—which took place
just about the time from which the lady
dated the alleged cruelty on which she relied
(unwisely) to win her freedom. That visit to
Palestine was no doubt the occasion on
which the little Jew collogued with others
of the race at Jerusalem. The dirt of the
place horrified him. Food in the stalls was
covered with flies. “Why don’t you drive
those off?” Louis said. “What’s the use?”
the man of Jerusalem replied—“they would
only come back.” So it’s no use going to
Jerusalem to escape the plague we’ve had
this early summer in Sydney.

Val Jamieson sang her “Magpie Ballads”
to an interested audience at the Southern
Cross Hall one night last week. Mrs.
Jamieson, who is a writer of stories and
articles, feels strongly on the subject of Aus-
tralia having produced so few songs that are
imbued with the spirit of our continent. Her
group of songs is a step in the right direc-
tion, and some of them should prove popular
—“Coo-ee,” for instance, as a principal-boy
song in an Australian panto.
The Council of Jewish Women of N. S.
Wales gave Mrs. Nathan a reception the
other night, in recognition of the good work
she did during her travels and by way of
encouraging her to proceed with her plans
for keeping baby’s bottle properly nourished
at Tiberius and Safed. In spite of her
altruism Mrs. Nathan wore frocking that
suggested Paris backed by the Nathan bank-
book.
Poor little Cecil McCleland, who was Cecil
McDevitt till last year, has been left a
widow. Her ex-Digger husband, Kenneth
McCleland, who had been working on a Gov-
ernment job in Papua, died suddenly at
Samarai on his way south. Cecil, who
was an army sister with the A.1.F., is now in
Melbourne with her mother, pluckily facing
her tragedy.
That good Australian, Chryssa Crichton-
Imrie, has been raising her voice in the
Daily Graphic in praise of our foodstuffs.
The energetic young woman, whose know-
ledge of Australian and Maoriland factories
is unique, declares that “Dominion food
wants a bounty at home, not the benefit of
a tax in England.” Miss Imrie still actively
helps the good work she advocates by run-
ning the Black Swan in the Westralian
Government Buildings, where luncheons and
teas make a loud advertisement for Dominion
foodstuffs.
Deaf and dumb brother and sister will
soon have their club rooms if the society
which has their interests at heart can pump
into the public a little of its own enthusiasm.
Even the just-before-Christmas feeling and
a Government House wrapped in unbleached
calico did not prevent the society rallying
in battalions to the meeting in Macquarie-
street the other day, when the question of a
monster ball next year was under discussion.
The preliminaries were arranged on the spot,
and Mrs. A. E. Hughes clerks the function,
which will take place early in the 1924
dancing season. Another lure by which the
society hopes to glean a golden harvest is
the Blue Bag. No, not a laundry competi-
tion. The Blue Bag is a dressy affair with
an ever-open month which can be fed only
with money. You’ll find it at the Mary
Elizabeth. A fair, at the Congregational
Hall, opened by the Lieut.-Governor’s lady,
was another of the week’s money-spinners in
the good cause.
A free playground where mother may
leave the kiddies safe in the care of a trained
kindergarten superintendent is the new ser-
vice that Murdoch’s, in Park-street, are
offering to their customers. The playground
is fitted up with swing and seesaw, and
Santa Claus has grown so fond of it that
he’s always dropping in with a bundle of
presents. Mother isn’t neglected: a cool
rest-room, an easy-chair and a,-cup of tea as
the firm’s guest help make her day’s Christ-
mas shopping easier.
Bondi is lapsing into superlatives over
its new jazz palace, the Casino. It overlooks
the Esplanade, and is going to open itself
with a dinner-dance on the 20tli.
The claim is made—and it looks authentic
—that a Mrs. Forester, who lives at Bal-
main, is 108 years of age. The old lady
has little memory, but she has a book in
which the record of her life has been kept:
and it shows that she reached Australia in
December, 1835 —on her 20tli birthday.
Married three times, she had seven children,
but only one of them survives, a very old
woman also.
Lute Drummond and the Ainsworth girls
are dropping messages into Sydney from all
over Western Europe. They have followed
step by step Joan of Arc’s progress. They
dawdled in the country of the chateaux.
The brand-new republic of Czecho-Slovakia
charmed them. They found Prague a very
crowded city—maybe the disturbances they
left behind in Germany had something to
do with that. In Buda-Pesth Lute heard
“II Trittico” in Hungarian—that’s the opera
she translated into English for Ricordi’s.
In Vienna they heard Weingartner conduct
“Tristan and Isolde,” and even managed to
hear Strauss’s “Salome,” which they found
more gruesome even than of old. When the
headsman descends with his sword to cut
off John the Baptist’s head, one heard weird
steel-sharpening effects in the orchestra amid
a fearful silence on the stage. The Sydney
girls felt seasick.
The Shakspeare Society has large
ambitions: it is forming a Players’ Club to
produce Elizabethan, Restoration and other
drama of outstanding merit, to encourage the
work of Australian playwrights and to move
towards the foundation of a national or
municipal theatre in Sydney. It intends to
rent a studio where the library of the Shaks-
peare Society may be housed, and where a
simple stage may be erected for the perform-
ance every month of plays and scenes from
plays suitable for chamber presentation. In
addition to the club-room plays, there will, if
its plans mature, be four seasons of Eliza-
bethan drama at the Conservatorium. To
be a member of the Players’ Club will cost
you £2 2s. a year; and W. F. Jackson,
president of the Shakspeare Society, invites
inquiries.
A Brisbane postscript:—•
Sir Matthew spoke in light vein over the haggis and
wood smoke at St. Andrew’s feasting. Chieftain
Cameron presided, and among the many orators was
warrior Harry Chauvel.
At Newstead Park, where stands the old home of
Governor Warwick and the Harrises —a house of
historic as well as social interest —much bunting was
hung out on the occasion of the Brisbane River cen-
tenary celebrations. Here Oxley certainly camped on his
Second voyage in 1824, and there is a suspicion that
here he landed first, though learned doctors disagree
upon this point. Sir Matthew, who is optimistic
about Brisbane’s chances of becoming one of the
most beautiful cities in the world during the next
100 years, said Oxley was a typical Englishman, in-
dustrious and a good surveyor, but seemed to lack
the imagination to grasp the immensities of Queens-
land. Dr. Cumbrae Stewart felt sad about the
fact that the Ma State has possession of the Oxley
papers, and Mayor Diddams said he hoped Newstead
House would yet be the Newstead Historical Museum
and Library, and hold the said records.
The Lyceum Club the other evening farewelled
Freda Bage, who goes to the Cold Country shortly,
and Miss Barker, 8.A., who is off to Maryborough on
transfer.
Sir Matthew at time of writing is on the Downs.
He stayed for a while with the Hubert Fairfaxes,
then went to Warwick by motor and lectured before
the Ladies’ Literary Society in Toowoomba on
the 6th.
Col. and Mrs. Thynne' collected a number of dons
and their wives at their home on Highgate Hill, to
drink tea on their pretty lawn. Mrs. Thynne was in
black georgette with turquoise touches, and her
daughter, Mrs. Keith Hall, in ivory marocain and
green. Sir Matthew was among the tea-drinkers,
with Michael Rogers on guard, and a few relatives
of the Thynnes leavened the highbrow atmosphere.
Loudres Hill Convent had its breaking-up this
week. Archbish. Duhig fathered the ceremony, and
Col. Thynne and Chief Justice McCawley were at the
concert. Alma O’Dea, who carolled here with Walter
Kirby, was a bright item on the programme. This
convent, which is run by the Good Samaritan Sisters,
dates only from 1916.

MISSES MONKS DOYLE
Phonse Contral 1532, 1533.
In a sense Mayoress Brunton began lier
reign on Thursday evening when she beck-
oned in -the civic wives and daughters to sup
with her in the old Council Chamber, and
then go on as a balcony party to hear the
speeches at the Mayor il banquet. Trailing
black and silver brocade, with a backwash
of velvet-embossed ninon clamped to one
shoulder with a glittering buckle, she how-
doed her guests in,her private parlor, flanked
by her predecessor, the Swanson lady, who
likewise glittered in black and silver. A
group of political women, headed by the John
Mackey dame, reinforced the councillors’
relatives, and there were also one or two
of a strictly unofficial variety. Three-
quarters of the crowd were in black, thereby
providing an excellent backcloth for the little
lot who splashed into color. The Mcßeath
lady scintillated like a frosted parma violet
in mauve-beaded effects, and Mrs. Jimmy
Dyer was in blue brocade. Mrs. Harry
Emmerton twinkled with black sequins, while
Senator Pearce’s little wife was browned like
a seasoned nut in chiffon and lace.
The G.-G. and State Governor Stradbroke
both did some talking at the banquet. While
the former kept to the beaten track of Em-
pire the latter stuck to civic matters. In-
cidentally, the Earl declared that it would
surprise many people to discover the beau-
tiful stretches along the Yarra between Mel-
bourne and Heidelberg, and he hoped that
they would not be blotted out by factories in
the coming by-and-bye. Apparently his Ex.
has been exploring the upper river in his
Countess’s new motor-launch. And, talking
of launches, there are people who are view-
ing the invasion of these choo-clioo craft
with alarm, as it may squeeze the rowboat
traffic off the narrow, curving stream.
The Melbourne Museum might have made
so pie effort to acquire the mummy head of
the : Egyptian lady which was one of the
curiosities left behind by the late W. H. D.
Le Souef, of the Zoo. The lady was said to
be the sister of the damsel who found Moses
in the bulrushes, and one wonders what a
footnote she could give to history if she
copld only speak. She was evidently a good-
looking girl, and some traces of the gold
leaf that probably formed part of the royal
death-mask are still adhering to her face.
The cranium was presented to the late A. A.
C. Le Souef in 1882, and there is a legend
to the effect that the mask was stolen by
Arabs. The highest price offered for the
relic at auction was £200; but it was con-
sidered too little for a person with such
connections, so the Princess will remain in
the Le Souef family until a more generous
buyer arrives.
Lady Forster in raven silk, with blue
feathers cheering her black hat brim, motored
to Clifford-street, Prahrau, on Thursday
afternoon, to prise open the new building
which will henceforth shelter the Renown
Free Kindergarten. It is to stand as a
memorial to the late Lily Fisken, who was
a keen worker in the cause. Lady Pat
Blackwood, also in an inky frock, accom-
panied her Ex., who was welcomed by Miss
Ella Guthrie and Mrs. A’Beckett, not to
mention a Kindergarten kiddy /who was the
envied of all the other small fry as presenter
of the official posy. The children made
music—the babies with their miniature
orchestra, the older ones with a sing-song
—and the tail-end of the shivoo was drowned
in tea in the diniijg-room. where sweet-peas
and delphiniums harmonised soulfully with
the brown wood furnishings and blue win-
dow curtains.
Last week Speaker Watt, of the Federal
Parliament, said farewell to his charming
young secretary, M'adge Lawrence, who is
to wed J. R. McGregor, Sergcant-at-Arms
in the Reps., on January 9. McGregor,
who brought home two or three pips from
the war, is a popular person who has eclipsed
all records in the graceful manner he car-
ries the mace to bed.
The Austral Salon, which keeps a large
store of welcomes in stock, uncorked one
the other afternoon for Irene Vanbrugh
and the other petticoated members of her
co. The John Iliffe, Quinnell and Harry
Vial dames formed a guard of honor, and
handed the star guest a bunch of beribboned
pansies; and Natalie Dawson, Charlotte
Hemming, Myndelle Isaacs and J. Howard
King released an agreeable musical pro-
gramme. The Vanbrugh was browned like
an autumn leaf, and had feathers billowing
from her droopy hat, while Ethel Wellesley
was demure in grey.
The triumph of the petticoat is an inter-
esting feature of the British elections. When
last Parliament assembled the first British
woman member, Lady Astor, was hailed.
Two others got in on by-elections—Mrs.
H. Phillipson, once a stage favorite as Miss
Mabel Russell, and Mrs. Wintringham, who
received a large sympathy vote in standing
for her dead husband’s seat. All three are
back again and they have taken five others
with them: the Duchess of Atholl, a Con-
servative ; Lady Terrington, a Liberal; and
three Laborites —Margaret Bondfield, Susan
Lawrence and Miss Jewson. These are the
most interesting of the eight. Miss Bond-
field started as a shopgirl, and now, one of
Labor’s best organisers, is President-elect
of the Trades Union Congress. Miss Law-
rence. a woman of the “upper classes” con-
verted to Labor by the appalling conditions
she met in social work, has graduated poli-
tically through County Council work. The
third is a Girton graduate, who took a job
as a servant in a London hotel to study the
conditions of the workers. Lady Warwick
failed again to get public support. She was
the first notable woman in England to pub-
licly espouse socialism; but the lady socialist
who broadcasts her photograph with her
head crowded with jewels rather spoils her
chances.
A line fat cheque will go to the Colling-
wood Creche and Kindergarten from the
tea and song staged in the Ormond Hall on
Friday afternoon by Mrs. James Angus and
her sister conspirators. The room over-
flowed with a kid-gloved crowd, and Lady
Forster, in biscuit-colored crepey material
and a brown-plumed hat, said the opening
piece. Bridge and poker figured largely on
the menu, and the ticket-money was further
weighted with the profits from a terrace of
sale kiosks. Irene Vanbrugh gave two reci-
tations, and the musical stars included
Dorothy Murdoch. Myndelle Isaacs, Dolly
Stewart, Minnie Waugh and Mrs. Teddy
Dyson. Mrs. Pitt Rivers was billed for a
song, but she had to scratch because of a
sore throat. However, she smiled upon the
gathering in champagne-tinted marocain
hedged in with brown fur and a hat to
match. Mrs. Monty Grover had an active
time, and a Frank Madden daughter was also
among the saleswomen ; but the busiest per-
son on the horizon was Mrs. Lennox Spiers,
the lion. sec.
Judge and Mrs. Maxwell Fleming re-
turned the other day to have a look at the
lady’s native gum-trees, which she had not
seen since her flapper days, when her parents,
the late Richard Blackwood pair, trans-
ferred to the Cold Country from their River-
ina squattage. Hartwood. Two brothers,
Robert and George Blackwood, came back
to Australia, but the third son married and
settled in England. His only son was killed
in the Big War.

Dora Warby made a hobby of collecting vocal
scholarships. At the same time she studied
dramatic work, and she got her first doses
of stage limelight in Repertory plays pro-
duced by Mrs. Gibson Young.
A fair ' crowd defied a mighty thunder-
storm to see the Countess Stradbroke unveil
the newsboys’ headquarters in Alfred-place,
clieek-by-jowl with the Naval and Mili-
tary Club. Their first ancestor was a
room in a piano shop, and the founder of
the enterprise was that Foster who after-
wards launched the South Yarra Try Boys’
Society. W. A. Callaway, the hon. trea-
surer, and Mayor Brunton poured eulogies
upon both the society and its philanthropic
hon. sec., Edith Onions, who sustains the
role of the newsboys’ guardian angel. After
the opening function Mrs. Herbert Syme
spread a tea party at the Alexandra (hub
for Lady Stradbroke, her daughters Helena
and Charlotte, and a number of lesser lights.
Mrs. W. T. Rowe postponed the return
to her Western District homestead so that
™ e could give an evening party at Max
Meldrum s Athenaeum Hall show, where a
portrait of herself is regarded as one of
the painter’s best efforts. With a back-
ground of rhododendrons shading from blush
pink to royal purple, she greeted the company
in. black georgette anchored at the waist
with a jet carbuncle. Her husband
and her mother, Mrs. Henry Norman,
stood by, the latter in black satin
brocade. A quartette from the Melba
t on. was responsible for the musical
menu, in which Gertrude Healey fiddled
soulfully, and Marie Bremner, Victoria
Anderson and Rita Taylor showed how artis-
tically a Con. girl can warble. Not the
least interested listener was Henry Russell,
who lias come here to manage the Melba
operatic productions. With him was a wife
who looked as though she had materialised
from one of the Meldrum paintings; she was
in lacquer red silk delicately cobwebbed
over with silver thread, and her dark head
was defiantly turbaned with vivid green—
truly an arresting figure. Mrs. Meldrum
smiled above a green frock, and Mrs. Thir-
kell (Burne-Jones’s grand-daughter), uphol-
stered in flowery silk, with roses dotting
her dark locks, was reminiscent of a deco-
rated florist’s box.

three years ago launched out on private
practice. Young Reginald is a grandnephew
of David Watterson, who looks after the
Edward Wilson Trust on the Argus Board.
Keith Murdoch, editor of Melbourne
Herald, has laid the foundation for one
of the ideal homes his paper talks about by
getting engaged to Peggy Mills, of Toorak.
The young man was sufficiently farsighted to
provide himself early with one of the essen-
tials for the ceremony—he choose for his
father the Rev. P. J. Murdoch, one of the
pillars of the kirk. The cake and confetti
will be ordered in when the future Mrs.
Murdoch is able to view life again from an
upright position after a recumbent six
months —her penalty for having bruised a
small bone in her spine. She is one of the
most popular flappers in the superior sub-
urb, and the Millses are, of course, one of
our very nicest squatting families. Peggy's
maternal grandsire was the late Col. Tom
Price. His eldest son, by the way, is now
a distinguished Indian Army general,
while the youngest, Franklin—better
known to his former pals as Poongie
—-earns liis crust in S’Africa. The
middle son, Vivian, after passing from
the merchant service to the British Navy,
died on active service. His widow, who,
with her small daughter, landed back in her
native Aussie after the Armistice, was a
Mills, which makes her an aunt twice over
to the little bride-elect.
Harry Emmerton’s niece Mary, who is
going back to England for a few months,
was farcwelled on Saturday afternoon with
tea and bridge by the Ernest Graham widow
at the Quamby Club. The party was rein-
forced half-way through by several non-
card-playing friends of the prospective trip-
per. Mrs. Graham was charmingly enfolded
in ficelle crepe with a touch of real china-
blue in the chest region, and smiled her
welcomes from under a black picture hat.
The chief guest was similarly ficelled, but
her undersheathings were of flowered silk,
and roses blossomed on her droopy black
lid. Vera Synnot, who is,tripping off on
the same boat as the Emmerton niece, was
in the crush; and Canon Evelyn Snodgrass’s
other half, who is also packing her steamer
trunks for the end of the month.
Mrs. F. Back’s youngest and only unmar-
ried daughter, Colomba. has announced her
engagement to Jack Cussen, a cousin of
the Judge. He hails from Adelaide, and
crossed to this city after shedding his war
khaki to direct the Vic. activities of the
Hume Pipe Co. With an unattached medi-
cal clium he dug in at Croydon, with a
tennis-court and piano to cheer their
bachelorhood; and all was peace until
Colomba Rack, who is a good-looker and
one of the best-liked girls in the first social
swim, broke in and left the unfortunate
medico to wonder what’s to become of him.
The Masonic Hall was packed on Friday
night when Lady Forster, a symphony in blue
and gold, handed out the awards at the Shaks-
pearean Society’s final 1928 gathering. Thu
prize-giving act was sandwiched into a pro-
gramme arranged by the tireless Charlotte
Hemming. The big thrills of the dramatic
events were scenes from “Much Ado About
Nothing,’’ by Charlotte herself and Frank
Russell; and Dorothy Murdoch and Millie
Tree Chapman headed the musical section.
Not every English actress visiting Aus-
tralia needs heaps of vegetable tributes to
set her talking sweetly of the country.
Sylvia Shaw, who expects to be homeward
bound on Christmas Eve, has simply loved
every minute of her time here. She had
only secondary parts in plays that never
boomed (her part in “A Faithful Heart”
was her best), but had she been two stars
rolled into one she could not have been
happier, she says. The hospitable people
who have entertained her in private life are
the nicest in the world, and Melbourne and
Sydney, each in its way, are the most
delightful cities. It doesn’t seem to have
occurred to the young enthusiast that her
own most attractive personality might ex-
plain her very coulcur de rose view of things.
The cable mentions Dr. Marion Phillips
as a vigorous figure on the Labor side in
the British elections. Marion is the daugh-
ter of a Melbourne solicitor who died a few
years ago. After graduating here she studied
at the London School of Economics, and
took a degree on her thesis, “A Colonial
Autocracy,” which was subsequently pub-
lished in book form. It is a history of the
social and economic conditions of the Mac-
quarie period. In London she has had a
number of important jobs. She was one of
the investigators appointed by the Royai
Commission on the P'oor Laws, and for a
time was organising secretary. of the
Women’s Trade Union League. Later she
became general secretary of the Women’s
Labor League and editor of its paper, the
Labor Woman.
Some Adelaide gossip :
The next State elections will see at least one
woman candidate in the field —Mrs. A. K. Goode,
who is to contest an Adelaide seat under the wing
of the Liberal Union. The lady is a good speaker
and keen debater, with a sound knowledge of com-
mittees and political organising, and she’ll at least
liven what would otherwise be a dull contest.
Ihe new Gaud Mayor’s first job was to bid about
400 of his ratepayers to the Town Hall to listen
to the speeches that accompany the drinking of
Colonel Light’s health. As well as speeches there
were meat and drink —tea and cakes to be exact —
at small tables scattered about a beflagged and bc-
flowered Town Hall. Or. Lundie, by the way, gave
the incoming chief magistrate a characteristic wel-
come by suggesting that his allowance (now £1000)
should be cut down to the “same wage as paid to
the corporation men outside”—l3s. Id. a day. But
reformers proverbially blaze a lone trail, and even
redoubtable Bert Edwards wasn’t forthcoming to
support him.
Tattersall’s December meeting at Morphettville
had such a vague sort of day that dressing ranged
from coats and skirts to. films of organdie and geor-
gette. Lady Bridges was in marocain that ran to
reds and yellows and blues, and with her were small
daughter Alvida and Miss Judge. Indeed, the com-
promise of marocain was the most popular wear,
mostly brown or black or blue with flashes of gold
or oriental embroidery. Of the truly summer frocks
one of the smartest was of white, warmed by bands
of yellow and topped by a black hat.
. Lady Bridges went out to St. Peters for the first
birthday of that suburb’s Girl Guides, taking with
her Miss Judge and Mrs. Medley (North Adelaide’s
District Commissioner) ; and she did what she rarely
does, i.e., embarked on a fairly lengthy speech.
Usually her Ex.’s words are of the briefest, but
she’s a keen Guider, and when it comes to talking
about the movement—well, she can.
Students at the Kindergarten Training College had
their diplomas handed to them by Lady Bridges, who
also passed on a word or two on the importance and
fascination of the teacher’s job. Director of Edu-
cation McCoy, just back from his trip to England,
was there, too, with a warning against the three
deadly sins that beset the pedagogue —perfunctori-
ness, indolence and conceit.
Conservatorium students stag-ed their final concert
with the Chancellor and Miss Murray in the pack.
Diploma-conferring came after Mr. Foote had con-
ducted the student orchestra triumphantly through
Mendelssohn’s “Midsummer Night’s Dream” overture,
and in the general programme that followed the star
performers were Clarice Gmiener and Melville Wil-
liams, the new Elder Scholar.
Some of the Parliamentarians who went with his
Ex. to the South-East found time to run out to
Dirigley Dell and see how Gordon’s old home ia look-
ing since a local committee got a grant from the
Government to tidy it up and instal a caretaker.
They report that all is flourishing—the little estate
of 12 acres or so has been fenched, the cottage has
been put into decent repair, and the caretaker is
keen on his job.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
When David beat Rapine in the Septem-
ber Handicap at Randwick, Eudorean, a four-year-old
chestnut mare by Eudorus —Jean, was within half
a length of the winner. In subsequent efforts Eudor-
ean was ridden in the hell-for-leather style which,
as regards 98 per cent, of horses, is quite the silliest
way of trying to win races at Randwick, and she was
generally done to a turn when the others were
commencing their runs. Saner tactics were adopted
with the big mare in the Rosehill R.C.’s December
Handicap at Canterbury Park. Instead of being
incontinently rushed to the front, she was kept
behind the pacemakers, Liberty Loan and Kikumon,
until they had blown themselves out in the straight.
Then she slipped up on the rails and romped home
from Maltiform and Cheerful; and at 14 to 1, too.
Handled in the same
fashion, she will have
to be reckoned with
in the Summer and
Tattersall’s Club Cups.
Still Eudorean’s task
was lightened by a
mishap to Tremolo,
that unlucky neddy,
who looked and trav-
elled well, being gal-
loped on so badly that
he had to be pulled
up and scratched for
his A.J.C. engagements.
Pteropod won another
sprint nicely, but
l«athos was beaten into
third place in the
Three-year-old Handi-
cap, run over the Vil-
liers distance. Cer-
tainly he carried lOst.
lib. and took a lot
out of himself by
fighting for his head,
but the company was
very poor.
OTWAY FAL
KINER, owner
of David.
Even Song’s form at Sandown I ark
(Vic.) suggested that she will be worth a small bee
each way in one of the middle-distance events
presently to arrive at Caulfield or Flemington. Going
out at odds on in the £350 handicap, in which
Ouverte, Lannion and Elibank were among the
starters, she had the field settled a furlong from
home. The sturdy chestnut is owned by Norman
Falkiner, and is now in Holt’s stable at Mordialloc.
If he can get her a bit fitter than she was on the
first Tuesday in November, when she was noticed
running on well just outside the placed horses, in
the biggest handicap of the year, an Australian Cup
may be within her compass.
Dr. W. H. Lang, the V.R.C. weight-
adjuster, has framed his last handicap. A younger
brother of Andrew Lang, poet, essayist and trans-
lator of Homer, he arrived from Scotland in early
manhood and settled in C'orowa (N.S.W.), where
he practised his profession and dabbled in horse-
breeding. The English sire Padlock was one of his
importations, and two good ones he bred were
Security, winner of the A.R.C. City Handicap, and
Key, a brilliant little bit of stuff, whose turf
career was too brief (she was stupidly overworked
as a two-year old), and whose union with Wallace
produced Scotland, a Newmarket Handicap hero.
A rare judge of a horse, a close student of form,
and a man of unbending honesty who was never
even suspected of betting, the doctor had the ideal
handicapper’s equipment, and made a conspicuous
success of a job which he took on fairly late in
life.
“D.”: Dr. Lang belonged to a famous Scotch
family most of whose male members were eminent
in some form of sport, while several wrote pre-
eminently well about their hobbies. One of their
peculiarities was that they loved the pastimes of
England, and discussed them more gracefully in prose
and verse than the English themselves. No one
in the United Kingdom has written more attract-
ively of cricket than Andrew Lang, and no one
in Australia wrote better of racing and the thorough-
bred than his brother the late doctor. It was in
1915 that W. H. went to Melbourne as handicapper
to the V.A.T.C., and a year later he became the
Y.lt.C.’s handicapper. * *
“0.K.” : It is tlie general belief of old race-
goers, founded on dim or dimming recollections, that
old-time Novembers in Melbourne were more sum-
mery than the modern sort. Byron Moore, secretary
of the V.R.C., is not so sure. Of the first 20 years
of his business connection with Melbourne Oup Week
he kept no weather record, and he is loth to speak
from recollection. “I have a very good memory,
but I have been surprised, when checking with
reliable records, to find how faulty it is after, say,
75 years’ wear,” says Byron Moore. Since 1898,
however, he has kept a record of Cup-week weather,
and this shows that hot, north-wind days have been
practically “off” during the past 20 years. On the
other hand, three out of five Cup Weeks, from 1898
to 1902, were mostly hot and north-windy, whilst one
of the others had warm, muggy weather for its last
two days. If Mr. Hunt, the meteorologist, were asked
to admit that a Melbourne summer, if any, begins later
than it did of old, and is not nearly so consistently
summery when it arrives, he would simply draw
some figures from his melting-pot of averages and
say that seasons may vary a little in their individual
years, but are unchangeable in the bulk, or words
to that effect. Cup-week records from the V.R.C.
office are really informative. They give no tempera
tures for the “bright and fine” or “perfect Spring”
days which have been fairly general of late years,
but they clearly show that the hot, sultry, early
November days of last century have not been repeated.
And if the Oldest Inhabitants of Melbourne maintain
that Cup Day in the very long ago was usually
hotter than at the end of the century, who will con-
tradict them? Certainly not meteorologist Hunt. He
puts the record of each month into a melting-pot,
where its effect on the ever-growing average is im-
perceptible.
“Hamer”: Although Humphrey Oxenham
won the Caulfield Cup with Waterfall and the Mel-
bourne with Acrasia he was not always well ahead
of it. Once when he was having a bad spin, a
hard case nipped him for a fiver. “You’ll never
see that again,’’ said another bookmaker, who saw
the deed done. “Bet you a hundred I do,” rejoined
Oxey. The bet was made, Oxenham binding himself
not to ask for repayment. The bad trot continued
until the big bookmaker began to think he would
have to tap somebody for a fiver himself if the
luck didn’t change. But just when things were
looking gloomiest the hard case repaid the loan,
and Oxenham was £lO5 better off. Within a week
he was able to talk in thousands again.
“0.K.”: The best horse Oxenham ever owned was
Cerise and Blue. She won the Sydney Cup in 1886
with Bst. 21b. up, after running second in the Aus-
tralian Cup with only 6st. 131 b. At Flemington she
had the bad luck to encounter the great Malua,
to whom 9st. 91b. was less of a burden than was
fist. 131 b. to Oxenham’s mare. They represented
the long and the short of it when they came to-
gether at the finish, Malua getting, as it happened,
the final run. t Little Cerise and Blue, positively the
meanest looking mare that ever ran great races,
had been pacemaking next to the rails, and Malua
came along on the outside of her. The stride of
Cerise and Blue had no chance against the famous
rush of MaluL For a moment, as the big horse
was passing the little mare, not an inch of her
w r as visible to the crowd in the stand. It was as
though Malua were coming in alone. The dictum
that a good big ’un must always beat a good little
’un in a neck-and-neck struggle was never better
illustrated.
“Break-Jointer”: Before they have done
whitewashing the Sydney pony joints, I want to
put in a word for certain other aspersed branches
of sport. The tales pitched about two-up, hazard
and bankers, about monkey or goose and marble
pool, about monte, Yankee sweat, spinning jennies,
orown-and-anchor and the rest have led to a lot of
the boys of the village having to go to work. Joe.
the Blaster and Brassy his cobber, under-and-over
experts for many years, have had to start tank
sinking. Old Di, who used to make the nobs and
greys and sliding kips, and sole and heel the crook
tatts for the hazard joints, is now in the Old Men’s
Home. Coffin Foot, who used to import monkeys
and train them, as well as geese for the marble joints,
has joined a circus with a team of trained cats.
A harder case than all is that of Stumpy Styx,
formerly the inventor of all the break-joints for
the wheel games—Stumpy has come down to winding
clocks by contract. We can’t all be pony heads;
but we can ask to be allowed open play with the
mob on the pony-courses. After all, mugs have
no more hope of getting away with the dough from
us than from them.
* * * *
Inter-State visitors had nothing to com-
plain of at the Austral Wheel Race meeting. J.
T. Summers, from N.S.W., pedalled away with the
M.B.C. Stakes, and A. J. Davies, the W.A. veteran,
captured the £l5O first prize in the Austral battle,
from Warwick (240), Bell (210) and E. C. Fisher
(240). Young Vern Edwards (60) met Davies
and Bell in one of the semi-finals, but the last lap
was a trifle too hot for hini and he finished
fourth. In the M.B.C. Derby, however, he moved
the crowd to real enthusiasm by defeating Willie
Spencer, the Yank. Spencer’s disposition to shirk
his share of pacemaking had previously brought
him into disfavor with the howlers, and when he
had done his best to reduce a mile race to a sprint
it was pure joy for the crowd to see him out-
generalled by Edwards. The Werribee boy won
comfortably from the American, whilst two other
starters —R. G. Beer and luckless L. K. Smith, from
W.A.—fell.
As good on the track as across country,
Frank Bailey, N.S.W. candidate for the Olympic
Gaines, won the three miles at the Dunn Shield
contests in 15min. 264 sec., —271 see. better than H.
S. Grandemange’s effort last year. And Bailey
slowed down after Hatton, the English Olympian,
had retired with a sprained ankle half a mile from
home. Shrubb is credited with 14min. 17 1-Gsec on
a grass track and Kolehmainen with 14min. 18
l-ssec. indoors, but they could never have repeated
those times on the Sydney Sports Ground. Ernie
Austen won the mile walk in 6min. 49 2-ssee. ;
and policeman W. F. Payne threw the discus 112 ft.
7in. Also there was a hotly-questioned dead-heat
between W. W. Hunt and Jim McManamey in the
220 yards, and E. H. Scott overcame Dr. Hornier
in the 440yds. hurdles. ’Varsity with 35 points
was easily the most successful club.
“15-30” : In the pretty row between W. M.
Tildeii and the U.S. Davis Oup committee unnecessary
peevishness has been shown on both sides. To accuse
the champion of claiming that he is so good a
doubles player that he needs no advice is plainly
silly, for Tilden has always admitted that he is
no great performer in doubles. On the other hand
Tilden’s threat not to appear in Davis Cup matches
again is equally childish, and he ought to have
sufficient generosity as a sportsman not to make an
international matter of a private quarrel. The
whole uproar seems to have been started by the
needlessly dictatorial tone adopted by a committee-
man to Tilden when the Yanks had lost two out of
the first three sets against the Australians and were
in a bad position. The American supporters were
upset by the great work of Anderson and Hawkes, and
Tilden, strained and nervous in a critical situation,
was probably like an inflammable prima donna,
ready to resent a frank word which he would placidly
listen to in normal conditions. The fact that he
adopted the suggestions made and moved up for
closer support of Williams at the net —which change
of tactics undoubtedly pulled the match out of the
fire —demonstrates that he was amenable to advice,
though the manner of giving it rankled. Some of
these tennis Johnnies are really as “temperamental”
as fat sopranos.
* * *
The historic game of royal tennis, which
is almost too haughty to recognise its offspring, lawn
tennis, has its ardent followers in Melbourne who
meet in a special court in Exhibition-street and have
a gold-racquet championship every year. The best
exponent of this strenuous exercise is Dr. Crawford
Henry Mollison, who has had his fifteenth win after
20 years of active service. Mollison, who is over
60, beat a promising young player, Douglas George,
in a comparatively easy manner, and the hardest
veterans of the game despair of wresting the cham-
pionship from him, unless gout or sciatica comes
along to lower his energy. He has now smashed the
record of the late Judge Box, who was the maestro
of his day with 13 consecutive successes against
strong opposition.

There are few more interesting batsmen
than Tommy Andrews when conditions are to his
liking. For Petersham v. University Tommy made
a beautiful 271 n.o. (out of 6 for 438) in 4hr. 7min.,
thereby dimming the lustre of Johnny Taylor’s 253
for Uni v. Waverley. Taylor, however, got 110 and
85 n.o. against the Petersham bowling, and other
cracks in form on Saturday wei*e Kippax (120) and
Kelleway (102). All four figure in the wonderful
batting side which is to meet S. Aus. and Victoria.
Thus far this season Kippax has averaged 171.5;
Kelleway, 118.33; Taylor, 91.71; Andrews, 82.83;
and Bardsley, 55.42. Were the bowling as good as
the batting' it would be a dismal lookout for the
other States.
While batsmen dominate the situation in
Sydney, bowlers mortgage the limelight in Mel-
bourne. On Saturday, Rayson, of Hawthorn-East,
almost roused the selectors from their sleep bv
performing the hat-trick against Melbourne. Al-
together he took 9 for 91. Blaekie, of St. Kilda,
who is not usually regarded as dangerous, removed
7 of ’Roy for 38, and the ever-reliable Grimmett,
of Prahran, spoilt Carlton’s hopes of victory wdth
6 for 70. As regards batsmen, Ponsford, of St.
Kilda, is doing famously, but some of the old-
timers, notably Ransford and Ryder, have yet to
strike form.
* * * *
“Treble” : The Victorian selectors are im-
proving. They have chosen 20 players to practise
on special M.C.C. wickets for the inter-State matches,
and three of the 20 —Gamble, of Hawthorn-East.,
Ebeling. of Melbourne, and Richardson, of Richmond
—are colts. Others included are St. Kilda’s veteran
bowlers, Don Blaekie and IT. Ironmonger, and twu
old-time batsmen, Hughie Carroll and Gerald Healy.
The odds are that the representatives who failed to
retain the Shield last year will be given a chance
to regain it, but Grimmett should be the first bowler
chosen, and the ex-Sydneysider Hampdon Love should
be picked for behind the sticks in place of Jack
Ellis. Four promising junior bowlers —Clennock and
McConchie from the Metropolitan League, Spoor from
the Furniture Manufacturers, and Vance from the
Prahran Friendly Societies —have also been invited to
practise. This is progress for Victoria.
“Rice”: The S. Aus. selectors have in-
cluded Pat Ohlstrom, a ’Varsity law student, in the
team to meet N. S. Wales. A medium-paced right-
hander who can turn the ball either way, Pat,
in four matches, has captured 30 wickets for 290
runs. Against Glenelg he dismissed eight batsmen for
15 on a good wicket. There is not much of him—
he is barely sft. —but it is all good cricketing
material. During the winter the little man keeps
his eye in by pitching for the ’Varsity baseball
team, of which he is captain.

“Copper”: Re rapid scoring at cricket (B.
29/11/’23). In an inter-town match at Queens-
town (Tas.), in 1913. E. L. James knocked up
117 in 45 minutes. The total was 9 for 125, and
10 or 12 minutes were lost in removing eight ducks
from the neighborhood. Sundries contributed 7.
“Nitric”: It is “Past Grammar” (B.
6/12/’23) who is wrong: Lawton is to play wing-
forward for Oxford, nor Should the position be
particularly strange to him. Tom played break-
away forward for his battalion team in France and
his Digger comrades were surnrised when he
appeared as five-eighth for Queensland v. the A.I.F.
Union side in 1919. He was never placed five-
eighth as a Leaguer.
* * * *
“D.”: Galsworthy in a just-published
pamphlet, “International Thought,” bemoans the
degeneration of the Press:
“If the Press, as a whole, never diverged from fair
report; if it refused to give unmeasured service to
party or patriotic passion; if it played the game
as Sport plays it- —what a clearance of the air!”
But does Sport play the game nowadays? Is it not
a fact that the sporting sportsman has to a great
extent gone the way of the chivalrous fighting-man
who, in the late war, almost invariably paid for
his manners with his life. The reproach against
the Press is that it has become materialis'tic, and
that is what has happened to sport. Tennis was
essentially a game for amateurs a few years ago, yet
nowadays we find our best performer making a re-
markably good business of it, while America’s first
choice disclosed anything but a sporting spirit of
the old silent, disciplined sort in his recent row
with the U.S. tennis authorities. Cricket, another
of the pastimes which formerly held its head high as
a sport for sportsmen, has become thoroughly com-
mercialised wherever there is money in it. No sport
—not even professional football—has been so ruf-
fianised as the one-time “Sport of Kings,” and prac-
tically all of the others are tainted.

By way of demonstrating that a mug is
born every minute, a Sydney Stadium crowd coughed
up £ 700-odd to see Eagei, the U.S. welterweight,
who was “disqualified” after his fight with Coiiins
(the Wren crowd declared it a schlenter), shape
up against Tommy Uren. Eagei was knocked out
in the fourth round with a right counter on the
jaw. It is reported on the worst authority that the
loser will meet Collins again and that Wren is to
be recommended for the Albert medal.

Cabled that Mike McTigue, the Irish
ehampeen, is to box Joe Beckett at Dublin, and if
he can plant one on the Saxon’s glass jaw—a not
very difficult feat, as Carpentier twice showed —the
ALF FELTON, who heat Barry on the
Thenes, and thinks he can heat Paddon.
shillelaghs will be flying in Wexford that night.
The last time McTigue fought at Dublin the ring
was lined with Free State bayonets to dissuade
Siki from knocking him out or to prevent the
Republicans from enlivening the proceedings with
bombs —the point is in dispute. And when he met
Young Stribling at Columbus, Georgia, he had an
even more exhilarating time. The night before the
mill four doctors certified that Michael was suffer-
ing from “an imperfectly-healed fracture of the
metacarpal bone of the left thumb.” What followed
is faithfully described by the N.Y. Police Gazette:
“Everything appeared to be all right until the
fans learned that the bout was off. Then yellow-
placards appeared upon the streets carrying the name
of the champion. Automobiles sported threatening
and unfavorable signs commenting upon McTigue.
The champion made a speech to the infuriated citi-
zens. He said, ‘l’ll fight with one hand.’ This re-
mark, however, was greeted with ‘Lynch him!’ ‘He s
got cold feet!’ A sturdy tree with rather low branching
limbs was pointed out. The crowd was then assured
by Mike that the fight would take place.
“McTigue entered the ring accompanied by an
armed escort. According to his statement and that
of his manager he was forced into the ring at the
point of revolvers.
“ ‘When I put both my hands out, pointing to
both corners to signify a draw,’ said the referee
afterwards, ‘an official came to me and demanded
that I give the fight to Stribling. I was told that
I would never leave the ring alive. Stribling came
over to me and put his hand in mine, and this offi-
cial came up and raised Stribling’s hand which was
grasping mine. I did not raise his hand as a victor,
and still maintain the fight was a draw.’
“Ertle claimed that as soon as he had given the
decision he left the ring and was immediately sur-
rounded by a mob of angry citizens, and that he
had not reversed his verdict even in the face of
threats that ‘unless he awarded the decision to the
Macon boy he would never leave the ring alive.’ ”
Mike, the critics agree, is an unexciting scrapper,
but he has the knack of causing a heap of excite-
ment in others.

The Adelaide-to-Melbourne motor record
has been cut down an hour and a half by Norman
Smith and Leonard Emerson. They started at 4.30
a.m., topped the Mount Lofty range in 12 minutes,
crossed the Murray at 5.50, were in Victoria for
lunch, and reached Melbourne at 6.21 (5.51 by Adel-
aide time) that afternoon. The rate touched 100
m.p.h. once or twice, and averaged 45 for the 597
miles. Yet Smith reckons he had bad luck, and
ought to have done the journey in 12 hours. It
rained for 300 miles, one stretch of 17 miles near
Hamilton (Vic.), had to be retraced, and on the
Coorong a startled emu broke the windscreen.
A SAVING GRACE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“There are bookmakers who are notorious for
‘fielding dead ’uns.’ The man who puts his hand
into your pocket and takes money out of it is
more decent.” —Evidence before the Pony Racing
Commission.
’Tis true he made a living out of Horse,
Which moralists account a vicious trade;
“He drank strong waters and his speech was coarse”
(As Kipling has it) ; flatly disobeyed
Commandments and conventions; and displayed
None of the qualities for which we look
In statesmen like our Deakins and our Seddons.
Withal, albeit a flashy, fleshly book,
’Twould be unjust to label him a crook:
He never fielded dead ’uns.
Clerics regarded him as an offence,
His calling they chastised with pulpit rods;
Also he jarred on the aesthetic sense
Arrayed in screaming checks and shouting odds,
Luring the foolish after futile gods,
Blind gods of Chance. The passions that debase
Assiduously he pandered to and fed on;
Yet in his dealings was at least a trace
Of decency, a saving gleam of grace:
He wouldn’t lay a dead ’un.
He never caused two blades of grass to grow
Where previously but one the eye could note;
His prices were invariably below
The ones returned to winners by the tote.
Yet in the Day of Doom, when the deep note
Of Gabriel’s trump o’er sea and land is blown
After the last of earthly Armageddons,
And sinners congregate before the Throne,
A chance for him may lie in this alone
When, hand upon his heart, he shall depone:
“I never fielded dead ’uns.”

How to destroy them
Diseased, Plague-infested
insects are a positive
menace, and should be
ruthlessly destroyed by
using
Kruses
Insecticide
Insects of every species are “down
and out” the moment this mar-
vellous exterminator is applied.
Kruse’s Insecticide positively kills
Fleas, Ants, Bugs, Flies, Cock-
roaches, Mosquitoes, Moths, etc.;
yet is positively harmless in its
application to Dogs, Cats, Poultry,
etc., etc.
For ttie destruction of Aphis,
Woodlice, and other plant-attack-
ing insects, a light sprinkling of
Kruse’s Insecticide in still weather
is all that is necessary.
One tin, carefully used, lasts a
very long time.
Be careful you get the genuine Kruse’s —
It never fails.

THE INKY WAY.
. ,Ti ie .Herald of Auckland has just been diamond-
jubileemg. It was founded bv W.. C. Wilson, who
was soon joined by A. G. Horton; and the sons of
the founders are on the bridge to-dav, with that
good, solid Scot, R. M. Hackett, as editor.
Passed out at 67, F. W. B. Greville, proprietor and
editor of the M.L. Dairyman for a quarter of a
century. Greville, whose round, rosy face was start-
lingly remindful of a prize Jonathan apple, was a
persistent advocate of cutting out water and the
Jiiilkmams thumb from the milk jug by bottled-milk
distribution, a system now in vogue in the M L
capital.
“Coot”: Melbourne Herald’s very latest importa-
tion is A. S. G. Baker, as pictorial editor. For
i k® was i n charge of the smudge department
of the Daily Mail and its stable mates. During the
war he served as photographic officer in the Royal
Air 1* orce, and secured some striking photographs,
including one of the sinking of the German battleship
Blucher in 1915. 1
• *7, Bateson”; The first newspaper published
in M.L. was the New Zealand Gazette, the second
number of which was printed and published on the
i lia" 6 mu ac l? 2* Wellh 'gton. It bore date April 18,
1840. The first number had been published in London
on August 31, 1839, and there was a second edition
on September 6. A four-page paper, it was edited
by Samuel Revans, and of the 350 copies issued only
five are traceable to-day.
at .9' Wh a r ton, whom they buried at
North Sydney the other day, found life rather dis-
appointing. Coming to Adelaide as a voungster, he
got his first job at St. Peter's College, but moved
afterwards into the Register office, where for years
he ground out leaders. Circumstances drove him to
Sydney 25 years ago ; but somehow he never did the
work of which he looked capable at the outset, and
in his later days he dozed contentedlv at Parramatta
He was 64 at the end.
R.R.”: There isn’t likely to be any argument
between the Sydney City Council and the S. M.
Hf'-RAJm over some land on the Hunter-street corner
which the Council wanted to acquire a few years ago
The Council has passed the plans for the building,
thereby accepting what the Herald is giving, though
it isn t what was originally asked for. The new
building will be rounded off at the corner, and the
surface of the land to be cut off by the semi-
rn-u® i Rg passed to the city as a free gift.
The building, when completed, will run to the full
permissible 150 feet in 10- storeys.
“Trevdee”: The Melbourne Sun-Herald contest
still goes on vigorously. Prize competitions are
the weapons in use at present ; and the Herild is
leading on points:
Round 1: Herald Beauty Competition. £lOO
„ 2: Sun Football „ £45 per week.

Numbers of hapless readers are hoping that Round 5
will be a news competition.
J'-B- ■' The other night Troedel and Cooper, the
Melbourne printers, gave a dinner in honor of
William Colley, who had served the firm for 60
years In a ramble through the past, the ancient
told how he had landed in Melbourne in 1852 and
jomed Charles Troedel in a small shop on the site
<£ the present _ Town Hall. The business afterwards
shitted to various addresses before it settl»d down
in Bank-place. Colley recalled how he had operated
the first lithographic printing-machine to reach
Melbourne and how lie used to cut paper with a
straight edge and share knife. North Melbourne
was a forest when he was a boy, and the present
busy corner of Elizabeth and Flinders streets was
a slushy depression from which the inhabitants
drew their water,
Norman Lindsay got this large spoonful from the
art critic of London Referee (14/10/’23) : “Each
drawing is full of the exotic force which has made
him the greatest artist that Australia has yet contri-
buted. In every case the treatment is consummate,
the magic of the line sings to the eye. The rich
textures, the glowing lights, dazzle and astound. And
this is achieved by such an economy of means that
one is left wondering. .. .Let me say at once that
J go .not consider any of the Lindsay pictures in the
exhibition improper. When all the clatter and scan-
dalous tittle-tattle has subsided, this fact will emerge:
Norman Lindsay is the greatest creative black-and-
white artist in the world to-day; and through his
art Australia joins the main stream.”
“Ex-Englishman”: London Pink ’Un was a
creation in the time of its founder, John Corlett
Be funny, ’ was the instruction to the staff; and
if they were improper it didn’t matter. But Corlett
grew elderly and sold out to De Wend Fenton, and
the old days came to an end. The staff wouldn’t
stav on. “But I’ve sold the piper as a going con-
cern, ’ Corlett pleaded. “Right!” they said, “we’re
aU. going. The new management seems to have
twisted the old motto round; writers had to he
improper, and if they weren’t funny it didn’t
matter. S° it is not necessary to be a wowser to
feel little surprise at the sentence now handed
to editor W. P. Evans. Four months and a £5O
fine is, however, so steep for a book-review that the
article must have been particularlv gamey. Other-
wise a clever counsel, citing Rabelais and Shakspeare
and the Book of Genesis, would have laughed the
case out of court.
“Macquarie Street”: William Butler Yeats, 57
the winner of this year’s Nobel prize, deserves 'he
distinction, but because of his unsociability and
moroseness he won’t hear much cheering. He is
often rude to his intimates, rarely shakes hands
even with his cronies, and insists on being called
“Mr. Yeats” by everybody. Galsworthy is a bit
of a recluse at Hamnstead, but he is sociability
itself compared with W.B.Y. If the latter doesn’t see
you, you have to try to believe that it is due to his
poor vision—he has high myopia. And he lives
(or did in my London days) in one of those prison-
like flats at the back of the Euston-road. Those
who don’t know his charming plays will remember
his poem “Innisfree,” so often quoted as the most
melodious in the language. “Deirdre” is full of
heart-remembered lines such as,
“Come now a verse
Of some old tune not worth remembering,
And all the lovelier because a bubble:”
and Cathleen ni Houlihan remains fixed in the
memory like many things of Synge, whom he dis-
covered.
TO AN OLD FRIEND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ye’re a black-blaek-blaekamoor thing,
Yi’ a neb like a sticky-beak ;
Blit it’s many a word ye made to sing,
And many a word to speak!
Ye’re a long black son-of-a-gun,
An’ ye’ve flung oot many a bomb ;
An it’s many a wrong ye’ve made to run
That thought ye a bauld long Tom!
Ye ha e played wi’ love as though it wore gauze—
As a gossamer thing of air—■
Now rhymin’ awhile, now makin’ a pause,
Then thinkin’ the thing was fair.
Ye ha’e taken my thought, ye black auld hose,
t Ye ha’e bound it down to a line;
Ye’ve inked my fingers an’ spotted my clo’es,
An’ yet ye ha’e been all mine!
Ye’re my auld black Never-let-go;
Louder loves talked, but ye stood by.
I hope, when they settle me down below,
Ye’ll come- —and never run dry !
e re an auld black-blackamoor thing ;
Ye are mendit wi’ cotton and glue.
But I wadn’t gie ye for a good goose-wing,
Nor the best that the stores ha’ new!

A Melba concert—-the Dame's first public
appearance since her return to Australia —
packed the Sydney Town Hall midway in
the week. Lindley Evans, at the piano,
warmed up the atmosphere with his open-
ing number, Schubert’s Impromptu, a lyric
performance. The basso, Prince Obolensky,
introduced himself in fine style in a Mozart
number, though the voice sounded somewhat
rough in the low passage. He was best
in a Russian group; and his voice showed
a fine capacity for expressing a sense of fun
in the absurd “Long Ago in Alcala.”
Dame Nellie’s big offerings were “The Wil-
low Song” and “Se Saran Rose” —a won-
derful contrast; and there was a group of
French songs, sung exquisitely. And John
Lemmone’s flute (liow marvellously it keeps
its magic!) added to the delights of the
evening.
At Sydney Royal Othello has a new Des-

is no difference worth mentioning in the cast,
except that Dorothy Seacombe replaces Doris
Kendal as the tricky flapper. Lawrence
Grossmith, it goes without saying, is as easy
and natural in his role of the preposterously
complaisant husband as G. Iv. Chesterton is
when engaged in presenting patent absurdi-
ties as self-evident propositions; and Diana
Wilson looks, and probably feels, a great
deal more in her element as the luxuriantly
alluring and unanalysable Helen than as
Desdemona for an Aschian Othello. Ashton
Jarry gives a decidedly improved rendering
of the amorous Major. Altogether “The
Silver Fox” was well worth revival as a
season-ender.
The Sydney Tivoli barometer rose with
a jump when Robb Wilton, a Cold Country
funmaker, took his first call on Saturday.
Robb is a droll and subtle humorist, with
a subdued manner and a fine taste in effec-
tive pauses. His songs are cleverly done,
and be is very funny as “Sherlock Bill,” a
muddled-headed limb of the law, to whom
Miss Florence • Palmer, playing- the part of
a husband-poisoner, gives herself up. Others
in the bill include Bailey and Cowan, who
use a saxophone and the twinkling toes of
a ballet; and Chinko, a juggler who keeps
a collection of kitchen utensils twirling in
the air while his lady-offsider performs tricks
upon a bike. And Maggie Foster, Claire
Solly and Vera Benson have joined company
with Anne Fald, and under the banner of
“The Austral Maids” present an enjoyable
musical pot pourri.
Jack Holt is the breezy “Gentleman of
Leisure” who is strolling through one-half
of the Sydney Strand’s bill. John’s freak
wagers involve him in some ticklish situa-
tions, but before the finish he collects the
money and a girl to help him spend it. “The
Woman of Bronze,” which fills the void
that John leaves, concerns the worries of an
artist’s wife when her husband’s models are
young and fluffy. The Lyceum is moving
with the times. In addition to “Westbound
Limited,” a nerve-racking film with uncon-
trollable trains rushing at each other, broad-
casted wireless concerts are given twice
daily. Rodolph Valentino has returned to
the Globe in the nightshirt of “The Sheik”;
and Hoyt’s weekly sermon is about the wiles
of lady companions, who wrench the heads
of stately homes from the bosoms of their
family. The other attraction, “McGuire of the
Mounted,” caters splendidly for the happy
adult with the juvenile mind. Hutchinson’s
best-seller, “If Winter Comes,” is a coming
attraction for the Crystal Palace.

“The Second Mrs. Tanqueray” still per-
sists in the indiscretions which attract the
public; and the misguided matron’s farewell
at the King’s, on the 15tli, will be full of
fond adieux and floral tributes.

At Melbourne Majesty’s a melancholy
colored person continues to offer crystal-
gazing gratis, and Emelie Polini has the luck
to get warned in time. If the crystal gave
reasons for the various futures it warns her
against, the play would have some psycholo-
gical interest. As it is, it leaves Gina
laboring under suspicion of having a mys-
terious kink in her character, while it offers
no hope of her good young man enjoying a
quiet life after marriage. She will be always
wanting to consult the crystal to find out
how soon her widowhood will set in. All
things remembered, “Eyes of Youth” is a
morbidly funny play, with a number of
quite reasonable characters; but these don’t
include the heroine and her faithful darkie,
and Goring, the vile traducer. Perhaps the
Judge of the divorce court is also unrea-
sonable, but he matters little. Edwin
Lester, Fernside, Kenneth Brampton, Frank
Harvey and Maurice Dudley matter a good
deal more. Next week an incoming Grand
Panto will oust Emelie Polini from Her
Majesty’s, and she will return to her dear
old home, the King’s.
“Tons of Money” will cease to be at Mel-
bourne Palace after the 15th, and ere the
stroke of Christmas one fair young- member
of the co., Sylvia Shaw, will make for her
native Britain. Dorothy Brunton and
Charles Ilislop are to stay on in the “Mother
Goose” panto , which arrives a week later.
At Melbourne Princess’s the last nights
of Doone are devoted to “The Rebel,” with
the same old sintiment, and with the song
of Doone aided and abetted by Edna Kee-
ley and the same company as before. The
difference between “The Rebel” and “The
Burglar and the Lady” is warmly approved'
by Doone’s disciples, but in defence of the
previous attraction it can be pleaded that
the audience usually insisted on the hero
making amends by singing The Wearing of
the Green before the little meeting dis-
persed. The same ancient hymn of hate
will doubtless be called for at the close of
the proceedings next Saturday. Doone is
no record-breaker where The Wearing of
the Green is concerned, but he awakens
memories of Maggie Moore in the same dis-
turbing ditty nearly 50 years ago, and
Memory (as Count Arnheim remarks in
“The Bohemian Girl”) is about the only
friend that Grief can call its own.
What shall be said of “Sally,” at Mel-
bourne Royal, apart from another mention
of its 100th local performance this last
Monday, and a further reference to the two

At Fullers’ Bijou, in Melbourne, the long
season of Jim Gerald and his musical co.
ended last Friday. For five long months
Jim had Geralded without a pause, and his
departure brought a pang of pain to loyal
Fullerites. The same night Long Tack Sam
folded up his adaptable gymnasts and noisily
stole away from the Tivoli, where Bert Ral-
ton and his Havana Band are now perform-
ing for only nine days and a like number
of nights.
A haunting fear that Futility has marked
the Pioneer Players for its own was almost
confirmed by their latest outbreak at Mel-
bourne Playhouse. The programme pro-
fessed to provide four short plays, but, criti-
cally speaking, there were no plays, or even
playlets, in the protracted entertainment.

w'ere but clever amateur dramatic sketches
adapted to the stage, and none the more effec-
tive for being played by amateurs, though
the mummers were generally competent and
well chosen, and the characters easy. “The
Pioneers” was the title of the opening
sketch, Katherine Prichard being the writer.
It was sadly humorless. The gentle hand
of woman showed in the fact that two char-
acters who never left the stage were a young
mother and her inarticulate pretence of a
baby. Much talk was addressed to the obvi-
ously mock infant, and at one time or an-
other two men (one of them an escaped con-
vict) had to nurse the silent bundle of make-
believe. Furnley Maurice’s sketch depicted
a doddering old idealist of doubtful sanity
and his sympathetic niece, contrasted with
a raucous realist of a land-and-estate agent,
whose thoughts in the Spring were loudly
turned to golf, and a brisk young butcher
who shocked the lady’s soul by bringing saus-
ages instead of grilling steak. Louis Esson's
neat and gloomy contribution dealt with a
fatal accident to a Far North drover, whose
mates had to push on with a mob of cattle
instead of stopping to attend his funeral.
Vance Palmer’s short scene showed three
various types of character in danger of hav-
ing to spend the night at an awful bush
pub. However, a neighboring squatter in-
vites them to come and roost at his superior
domicile, so they go off happy, and the cur-
tain falls slowly. A bright enough sketch,
yet it brought Australian drama no for-
’arder, as a tenant farmer complained of the
squire’s wholesome French claret.

A generation fed on American thrills will
hardly relish the calm English version of
“The Bohemian Girl,” at Melbourne Majes-
tic, even though Gladys Cooper, Ellen Terry
and Constance Collier are in the cast. The
film seems disqualified for local consumption
by its lack of telephones, vamps and gun-
play. The Society for the Perpetuation of
the Pie Film will not be elevated by the
Majestic’s other subject, “Mord Em’ly,” a
genial and unforced adaptation of a Pett
Ridge story. Hoyt’s have hired the some-
what passee Clara Kimball Young to shed
some fresh light on the problem of the eter-
nal triangle in “The Woman of Bronze,”
but Clara is no longer bewitching, and her
efforts to present the wronged wife leave
one disgracefully sympathetic with the other
cat. There is some humor in “A Gentleman
of Leisure,” though the plot has seen better
days. “Watch Your Step” is a snuggly
drama, some of the scenes whereof are being
perfectly imitated in the dark corners of the
Britannia. At the Melba “Quincy Adams
Sawyer” is causing discussion as to whether
Blanche Sweet is worth all the trouble the
hero takes to capture her heart.

Adelaide Repertory Theatre repeated si
success of long ago when it gave to two
crowded audiences Arnold Bennett’s “What
the Public Wants.” This play carries its
years wonderfully well; in fact, the satire on
newspaper magnates is more needed now
than when the play was written. The dia-
logue is natural and unforced, and full of
disrespect for conventional things. But Ben-
nett gives a glaring example of his pet fault,
introducing new characters late in the play >
in Act 3, which shifts the action to his h lve
Towns, there are six small new parts to
delay it. The acting was good, though the
Rep.’s biggest men stood out and gave otheis
a trial. Joyce gave a satisfying unconven-
tional picture of the youthful millionaire,
a tremendous figure holding the stage nearly
all through; and Langley, as the cultured
brother, played up to him well. Gwen 11 one,
of the beautiful voice and face, is probably
not the Five Towns lassie that the author
intended. But it is a man’s play, anyway.
Thomas Nave was producer.
“Renquillian”: About the earliest Aus-
tralian exponents of coon-minstrelsy were
the Cottiers. There were three brothers and
a sister, also a sister-in-law, Amy Blackie.
After the old cafes closed down, and while
troupes of minstrels were still coming in
from the U.S.A., the Cottiers opened a show
in the then Sydney Protestant Hall, run-
ning it on Saturday and Monday nights. A ver-
satile clan, they played bones, tambourine and
banjo; sang comic, descriptive and sentimen-
tal ditties; did songandance stuff and acro-
batic turns, with sketches, farces and a harle-
quinade. The Permans.the Fannings and other
music-hall septs followed the lines laid down
by the Cottiers.
“J.F.H.” (Lond.) : Barry Sullivan be-
queathed a fine collection of playbills to the
British Museum. One refers to a row in a Shef-
field theatre 70 years ago because the leading
actor, a Mr. Brooke, failed to turn up and
play “Richard the Third.” The playbill
of the following night gravely assured the
public that his Majesty’s absence was “not
caused by negligence or premeditation.”
G. V. Brooke occasionally disappointed his
audiences in Australia also. Once at the
Theatre Royal, Ballarat, George Coppin had
to come out and announce that Brooke was
“unfortunately indisposed and unable to
appear.” “Drunk, you mean,” shouted a
digger in the pit. “Well,” rejoined Coppin,
“you can put it that way if you like.”
“Lond.”: Charles B. Cochran, the “pro-
ducer,” is disillusioned about London taste.
Asked lately to join in a “symposium” oil
the question of changing one’s views on
important matters, he let the others prattle
about religion or politics, and talked of his
own business:—
I thought once that the British public wanted new
ideas in the theatre. I’ve changed my mind. “The
Merry Widow’’ is packing Daly’s. The most success-
ful box-office play at the moment is “The Prisoner
of Zenda.” The most successful musical comedy
recently had a different title, but the same situations,
the same jokes, and even one of the actual players
popular at the Gaiety 20 years ago. The scenery
and costumes looked the same. The most successful
revue has the humor of the music-hall of 25 years
ago. .. . “Anna Christie,’’ wonderfully acted, lost
money; “Chauve Souris” lost money; “The Miracle”
lost money ; and so on—l could fill a column.
Perhaps the publicity man whom the Coch-
rans and the rest have hired has had some-
thing to do with it. He can and does use as
many superlatives about the rottenest show
as about the best —wherefore the public be-
gins to take no notice of any recommenda-
tions. In fact, it cynically says that every-
thing new is poor, and flocks to the old
accordingly.

first. Fine likewise was her work in “La
Pericliole,” especially in the denunciation
scene; nor has Charles Carter’s acting in
that scene been forgotten. Does anyone know
what became of Carter?

“0.K.”: Graham Moffat and his wife con-
tinue to tour Britain profitably with “Runty
Pulls the Strings.” Moffat is a riper Elder
Tariijnas than ever. Mrs. Moffat is now Susie
Simpson, and their pretty daughter Winifred
plays the name-part. Australia and M.L.
could do with some more “Bunty Pulls the
Strings,” if the Moffats are as well sup-
ported as when this hemisphere first saw
their show. No comedy played here within
the past 20 years left such vivid memories,
or has been more affectionately spoken of.
“Bunty” travelled not on its Scotchness for
the Scotch, but on its humor and humanity
for everybody. It had a wider and more
genuine attraction than Barrie’s “Little Min-
ister,” though it lacked the advantage Bar-
rie’s play inherited from the novel. Simple
truth in stage characterisation never went
further than in the scene where Bunty said
to her snuffling adorer : “Willum, blow your
nose.”
HE HAD CONSIDERED ALL THAT.
FILM PRODUGER: “ Now you leap into the
rapids.”
ACTOR'S SUBSTPTUTE: “But that's a hit of
a risk, isn’t it?”
FILM PRODUCER: “Why, of course it is!
But go ahead—you don’t have to appear
in the film again.”
On sincere flatterers :
The natural tendency of histrionic art, on or off
the stage, is to be imitative. Thackeray, in “Pen-
dennis,” tells how the old major, walking with nep-
hew Pen. along Piccadilly and honored by a passing
nod from the Duke of Wellington, amused his young
relative by trying to walk and speak like the Great
Duke for the next five minutes. A Sucking orator
endeavors to form his platform style after some
model he bears in mind. And the mummers!
Among a hundred mimics of Henry Irving’s manner-
isms in his earlier days (Kyrle Bellew was of the
number) there was one Floekton, who became so
obsessed with his imitation that he spoilt himself
for English engagements, and had to go to America
to get good parts. Actors who come. to Australia
**> play in recent British successes ar e almost invari-
ably imitators, unless they happen to be the London
originals. The late Frank Thornton so slavishly
copied Edward Terry, the original Dick Phenyl in
“Sweet Lavender,” that Terry was generally regarded
as the replica when he came to play the part. The
vaudeville stage is a school of mimicry. It
seems to be a rule in thqatrical business
that the first successful way of doing any
particular thing on the dramatic stage is the
way it should be always done. A tradition is estab-
lished. When Hugh v> ard brought Charles HeSlop
and Dorothy Brunton to play in “Tons of Money,”
the young man affected a restless, jerky manner
which came uneasily to him, and was plainly
adapted from a London original, whilst Dorothy had
to pretend to be French because a Frenchwoman —
Yvonne Arnaud —had “created” the part, and some
lines had been put into the farce on her account.
Whilst retaining her breezy Australian personality
Dorothy Brunton lapsed into a mock-French accent
whenever she thought of it, instead of getting the
interpolated lines cut out, and talking like her
natural self.
“Tliersites”: Asche is unquestionably a
great stage director, but I wonder at some
tilings in his production of “Othello.” When
he makes liis long speech in the Venetian
Council Chamber, his back is turned to the
Duke. Why? Even a stipendiary magistrate
wouldn’t stand that. Having smothered Des-
demona, the Moor draws liis snickersnee to
finish her, though the text makes him say :—
Yet I'll not shed her blood,
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow....
There are other hits of stage business that
rather puzzle me, but those two will do to
start an argument.
“Second Murderer”: Yes. the Immortal
was a very careless playwright. In Act III
of “Othello" he makes the Moor say:—
That handkerchief did an Egyptian to my mother
give.
And as if that dreadful sentence wouldn't
cause confusion enough, in the last act he
refers to the same article as “a handkerchief,
an antique token my father gave my mother.”
“F.A.”: Edwin Brett’s quietly effective
work iii “French Leave” and “Joseph En-
tangled” made many Sydney playgoers ask
“Who is he?” The question shouldn’t have
been necessary. Fifteen years ago Brett was
at the Criterion, in the Clarke, Meynell and
Gunn version of “Cinderella.;’ He was a
good Dame, and was well supported by
Cromwell, Tommy Payne and Tliorley.
Most of that cast were in the initial produc-
tion of “The Arcadians” at the same theatre.
Brett’s Tavender in “Joe Entangled” was a
capital interpretation, especially in the
letter-writing episode, which might so easily
have been overdone.
“Jeldi Jou”: A Glasgow paper publishes
photos of James Hay, who left Perth for
London before the war, to get a polish put
on his tenor, and returned in 1920 with a
Gilbei't and Sullivan co. which toured Aus-
tralia and East Asia. Hay has been play-
mg Patie in Allan Ramsay’s old ballad opera,
"The Gentle Shepherd,” and receiving good
notices, as the husband of a millionaire’s
widow should. The company included Chris-
tine Lorimer, who joined the Gilbert and
Sullivan combination in Asia, and left it at
Kobe. Hay quitted the show in Melbourne.
They had previously been together in one of
the D’Oyly Carte companies.
“Abbot P.”; Ada Reeve’s intention of
playing Aladdin in pants instead of tights
reminds old-timers that Julia Matthews did
the same in the ’sixties. Fellow-comedians
in that performance were G. LI. Rogers and
Geo. Fawcett; and the co. included James
Milne, father of the present mechanist at
Melb. Royal. Notable Aladdins nearer to
these times were Maggie Moore and Nellie
Stewart.
“Lond” : Apropos of “Titus Andronicus,”
which has _ been revived in London for the
first time in half a century, there is much
pi’otest. against the idea that Shakspeare
wrote it, though he seems to have lent a
hand. It proves a fearfully difficult play
to “get across.” The heads brought on in
a basket, the junior villains cut in pieces,
baked in a pie and served up for their
mother to eat. with the almost continuous
murder and mutilation, come perilously near
making the average audience giggle.
“O. Blin”: Reading of a plump actress
who claimed to have been bitten by a tiger
in a faraway circus, I was somehow reminded
of the no-longer slender wife of an ex-star
who craved to be thrown to the lions in “The
Sign of the Cross.” She wanted him to
secure the rights for a small-town tour, and
to pay for a company to support her as the
Christian martyr, himself being Marcus
Stupendous. But he was not to be tempted.
“No,” he said heroically, “you can’t play
Mercia. Even a lion would see that he
couldn’t manage it.”
“Mancam”: A Sydney newspaper, speak-
ing of the lighting effects at . Asche’s
“Othello,” marvels at the “six large arc-
lamps, each with a light capacity of 10,000-
candle-power.” and asserts that “these
modern producers have banished the old-
fashioned limelight.” Well, I played with
Rignold at Her Majesty’s, and, although he
was nicknamed “Limelight George,” there
wasn’t a lime in the theatre. All the
“floods,’ “spots” and stage-lighting effects
were obtained from electric arcs worked
behind lenses. And that was 28 years ago.
“Mancam”: Talking of the stage dead
being resurrected to smirk and bow to an
unappreciative audience, Oscar Asehe might
improve on his present caper after the
catastrophe in “Othello.” Instead of Des-
demona, Othello and lago standing in a row,
why don’t they join hands and skip down to
the foots like the old-time variety sketch-
team? Oscar might sing the time-honored
Cockney tag:—
Our little sketch is ended —
Deny it no one can —
Ongcore us, applaud us,
You m’y do an you can !
An’ come again termorrer,
Each woming, child or man,
An’ so Gawd bless our little sketch,
Likewise the workin’ man!

Prudence Vanbrugh, daughter of Violet and niece
of Irene, has, scored a big success as Princess -Flavin
in a Haymarket revival of “The Prisoner of Zenda.”
A tall, dark, graceful girl, who resembles both her
mother and her aunt, Prudence is only 21.
A body calling itself the Fellowship of Players is
producing Shakspeare at the Lyric on Sunday nights
and turning money away. The Fellowship, which
has a roll of 140 members, aspires to give actors
and actresses “condemned to play monotonous parts
in popular successes” a chance of showing what they
can do in the higher walks of drama. It also
aspires to make money, but that isn’t mentioned.
Bernard Shaw’s “Back to Methuselah,” a survey
of the history of this world and a fancy forecast of
the next, has “gone big” at the Birmingham Reper-
tory Theatre. It occupied 12 hours in presentation,
and was spread in sections over five daily perform-
ances, each attracting a crowded and highly inter-
ested audience. The Times, which sent a special
man to Birmingham to report progress, predicts that
Methuselah will “prove a landmark in the history
of the stage,” inasmuch as “serial drama will lead to
habitual theatregoing and free writers of merit
from those limitations which have inclined many of
them to forsake the dramatic for a more elastic
medium of expression.”
“Royce Rolls” : The opera of “Pelleas and
Me lis an do,” which Melba was prevented from
bringing to Australia owing to “the prohibi-
tive royalties demanded,” is associated with
the American prima donna Mary Garden, who'
was cast as Melisande in the initial Paris
production. Mary is the most boosted of
Yankee songstresses. At one time she so
fascinated the eclectic and discriminating
James Huneker that he wrote a honey-sodden
book about her. She has done the name-
part in Charpentier's “Louise,” and there
was a roar of approval when she introduced
the heroine in Massenet’s sticky musical set-
ting of Anatole France’s “Thai's.”
“Fax” : Hugh Ward looks like scoring an-
other win with “Little Nelly Kelly.” The
Pall Mall Gazette said it was the best
thing of its kind seen in London since “The
Belle of New York.” But why this Ameri-
can tendency to exploit Irish names for
show purposes? Ages before the birth of
“The O’Brien Girl” there was “The Widow
O’Brien,” and before “Little Nelly Kelly”
there was Sousa’s Band making a comedy
feature of its “Has Anybody Here Seen
Kelly?” Why do these Kellys get all the
“fat”? What have the Finucanes done?
“Orb” : Touching Emily Soldene and “La
Fille du Madame Angot” (B. 6/12/’23),
Emily took her stage farewell at Sydney
Lyceum on June 5, ’95. There was a slash-
ing programme, all the topnotcliers of Syd-
ney figuring in it, from George Rignold'
along to Harry Rickards. The Royal Comics
did the second act of “Madame Angot,” with
the beneficiary as Mdlle. Lange and Nellie
Stewart as Clairette. Others in the cast
were Henry Bracy, Wallace Brownlow, W.
Rosevear, A. Lissant, Howard Vernon,
Charles Beetham, May Pollard and Minnie
Everett.
“G.A.C.”: “Stabbard Lyte” (B. 22/11

cism, constructive or destructive, is almost
taboo on daily papers. As much fulsome
adulation as you like to write, but you must
not suggest that a part might be more in-
telligently played, or that the author has
done better work. I wrote a notice of a show
that was hopelessly bad. The mangled thing
that appeared next morning merely conveyed
the impression that I had not liked it. -out
even then the band played so merrily that
a half-column of tawdry adulation had to be
printed. It made me look a fool and the
paper a trifle worse, but it satisfied the busi-
ness department; and that is what matters,
isn’t it?
“G.A.C.” : One sometimes hears of a musi-
cal comedy whose
tunes are stale in Aus-
tralia being billed as
a novelty in London,
but it rarely happens
to a serious play. It
is happening just now
to “The Lie,” a weak
effort of Henry Arthur
.Tones, which Miss
Ernelie Folini played
in Sydney. “The Lie”
has had some success
in America, but it
didn’t arrive in Lon-
don until Sybil Thorn-
dike put it on as a
stopgap, her daring
performance of “Cym-
beline” having come ii
thud. Sybil will need
to pour all her art
into the Jones play if
it is to be less drab
and dreary than it was
with Miss Polini. It’s
hard to believe that
the author of “The
Liars” and “Mary
Goes First” wrote it.
“Norbell”: Stage ladies liave their little
differences, too (B. 6/12/’23). Dan Barry
told me of a cataclysmal barney that arose
off-stage at Tallygotwoup between Denise
Duval and Clarissa Carew during a perform-
ance of “The Girl Who Put the Bluebag in
the Soup.” In the dressing-room Denise
had a strangleholt on Clarissa, while that
ingenue was chewing her opponent’s thumb.
Dan said he had a job to prise them apart,
and they went on for the deathbed scene
swearing they’d have it out after supper at
the Cocky’s .Toy. Dan was staying at the
same pub, and was afraid to go home after
the show, fearing a tragedy. So he went for
a long walk, and sneaked in the back way at
1 a.m. As he was tiptoeing towards the
stairs he passed a lighted parlor, and the
two ladies hailed him. They w 7 ere sitting
side by side on the sofa in confidential con-
verse. “Come on in, Mistier Barry,” said
Denise tearfully; “Clarissha’s” been tellin’
me ’bout her dear ole mothersh.”
“Caesar’s Ghost” : The circus Fitzgeralds had
troubles after they made their rise (B.
22/11/’23), notably when they quarrelled
with the Wirths. Both shows were in Maori-
land, and one arrived in a district in which
the other was playing. It was probably an
accident, but it was treated as intentional,
and for a season the circuses made a point
of getting in one another’s way. I was
with a theatrical crowd that found itself
jambed between them and had to move into
a railless region to avoid worse trouble. In
the end it was agreed that one circus should
go north and the other south, but not before
the bitter business had cost both families a
pretty penny.
“Almurta”: Adelaide wasn’t unanimously
impressed with Harry Richards’s judgment
(B. 8/11/’23) on his first visit to the
Holy City in 1872. He appeared at White’s
Rooms, King William-street, now the
Majestic Theatre, and fell foul of the Regis-
ter, which had slated his show. ’Arry had
a song called “Brown the Tragedian,” and
worked a bit of pepper into the patter:—
What do they offer for talent now ? Why, I have been
offered five-and-twenty shillings a week to play Ham-
Jet, and do the billsticking in the morning. Did I
accept ? No! Blood and blue fire, I would just as
soon become a reporter on the Register.
’Arry -was rattled enough to keep this poor
gag going for several nights. But the Regis-
ter survived it.
“Deirdre” : Is there any up-to-date Ameri-
can slang that is not ages old? Take the “I'll
tell the world” which recent New York plays
have foisted on Australia as a choice bit of
Broadway (or Bowery) jargon. I cannot
say whether the expression is in any of the
Ogham scripts, but it appears to be a direct
translation from an ancient Erse saying. In
his “Deirdre” .Tames Stephens makes Ardan,
the son of Uisnea, say: “I tell the world
that in six years I have not felt safe for a
minute until this minute.”
PIERROT'S SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Carnival’s over;
Joy like a rover
Vanishes with the stars.
Bright balloons shattered,
Gay dancers scattered,
Hushed are the glad guitars.
Gold lanterns glittering.
Light tunes a-twittering
Sped through the gleaming throng.
Columbine’s laughter
Echoing after
Pierrette’s burst of song.
Carnival’s over,
.Toy like a rover
Flies as the last stars fade.
Who would defy it,
None can deny it,
Life’s but a harlequinade!
QUEENSLAND.

Isko Automatic Electric Freezing Machines
Your own Cold Storage
Plant at Home.
ISKO is a simple device that
Manufactures Cold, convert-
ing your Refrigerator into a
miniature, self-operating Cold-
storage plant connected with the
house current, doing away entirely
with the use of Ice in the home as
a refrigerating agent, at the same
time introducing a method of
food preservation more conveni-
ent, more sanitary, more economi-
cal than that afforded by blocks
of melting ice.
It is an independent unit, can
be attached to any refrigerator or
Ice-box, and is absolutely fool-
proof.
It is automatic in operation and
so simplified mechanically that it
needs no expert attention.
It makes fifty cubes of Ice every
day.
The cost of current is trifling,
and the machine can be worked
on any voltage from 32 Volts up-
wards.
A complete model of this Isko
Automatic machine of one-ton
capacity, suitable for Residential
Hotels, Butchers, etc., is avail-
able.
is=3
If
THE chambers and motor are
mounted on a single base,
which may be set on top of
the refrigerator or in an adjoining
room. The glycerine-tank, made
in sizes to fit various standard re-
frigerators, is placed in the ice
compartment and connected to
the machine by two seamless
copper tubes. The only moving
parts of Isko are the the two rotat-
ing gears of the compressor,
which run submerged in a sealed
chamber of oil and are direct con-
nected to the
motor. The refrigerant— a harm-
less gas—is also sealed in its
chamber. When cooled under
moderate pressure it becomes a
liquid, and as such is supplied to
the expansion coil of the tank,
where it expands into gaseous
form, extracting the heat from the
chest. When it has absorbed its
quota of heat the compressor re-
moves it from the expansion coil
and delivers it to the condenser
chamber, where the water, circu-
lating through the cooling coils,
carries off the heat, and the gas
again becomes a liquid and is
ready to start on another journey.
This simple process is carried on
in continuous cycles. Isko is auto-
matically operated, and can be set
to maintain any suitable degree of
cold in the refrigerator, the cur-
rent clicking on and off at the pre-
determined temperatures.
Refrigerator Cabinets made to order and machines fitted.

models that he could not buy anywhere. For
instance, where could you buy a working model of a
Travelling Gantry Crane or Drop Hammer such as those
shewn here ?
The reason why you can build such wonderful models
with Meccano is that every part is a real engineering
piece, each perfectly designed and accurately made.

It was a poor old mangy dog
That down the street did roam
Out in the cold and clammy fog,
He ne’er had known a home.
Said Bill, “Come on, old dog, I’ll
Give you something to eat;
Somehow I like the look of your dial.
Come, have a feed of meat.”
The fleabit mong. wagged his tail,
He ne’er had known kindness,
And seemed t 0 say," “I'll go bail
You’ll remedy, my fineness.”
“Your money or your life,”
A voice in the darkness -said ;

He brandished o’er his head.

Took vicelike grip on trousers ;
The miscreant let a dismal howl
And disappeared into one of the houses.

week:—
On Friday, the thirteenth of October,
Michael Murphy commenced to shave;
But e er the dawn of th’ Monday was over
He rested in his grave.
He had stropped his razor well
And applied the lather until white;
Down his left cheek glided tIT razor,
Then it glided on towards his right.
But the cat jumped off the sofa
And give him such a terrible fright,
That he severed his jugular vein
And expired before the fall of night.

An idea ; but you must brighten it up... . Rene C.:
“Roland” is no good; in “Night” there are some
good lines, but it falls to pieces... .I.D. (Hawks-
burn): The idea has been too often worked....
R. (Ballarat): Not nearly enough in it. .. .North-
erner : Quite impossible to read it. Not content with
generally writing b for d, you vary the monotony

AA’.B.H.: Nothing in them K.A.J.: Wild picture-
show stuff.... 5.0.5.: Don’t know what it means.
And it s really too hot to start off on a guessing
competition P.11.C.: That is quite different. It
is not the advance that is turned into a deposit;
it is the security that has been lodged to get the
advance. Smith has a house, worth £lOOO. He
gets an advance of £5OO by lodging the deeds. He
can then draw £5OO and deposit the amount in
another bank Don P.: But sterilisation doesn’t
mean what you evidently think it does.... Pro and

Too carelessly done. If you want people to read you,
you might at least offer them the courtesy of

“Trevdee”: Artful advertisements? A

“Adamascus” : Western Bananaland is be-
ing treated with fertilisers to see what effect
they will have on the growth of grass. The
experiments are being conducted by a firm of
pastoralists on Isis Downs and Emmet.
Nitrates and super-phosphates are being
used, and large supplies have been procured
to give the experiments a chance under all
sorts of conditions.

“Yacko”: Lieut. Joshua J. Moore was the
original owner of Canberry, now Canberra,
the Federal capital. The estate was of 1000
acres ; Moore paid £250 for it. The original
homestead still stands, and with modern
additions is known as Acton House. The
severe drought of 1843 hit Moore hard, and
he was obliged to assign this station, though
he retained Baw Baw, near Goulburn, where
he died in 1864.
* * * *
“Pat Bushie” : In a little shop-window a
badly-printed notice, “We Sell Fords,” look-
ing as if it had been “written with a thumb-
nail dipped in tar,” caught my eye. In the
shop I casually expressed surprise at mixing
a motor-agency with a fruit- and lolly-busi-
ness. “Oh, that!” said the buxom lady be-
hind the counter. “It ain’t about cars.
Caps’an cigarettes are known as Fords by
all the lads what shop ’ere, and I likes to
move with the times, you know.”
“Sierra”: The Salvation Army Auxiliary
Co. of Australia, Ltd., has presented to the
old residents of the People’s Palace, Sydney,
a Christmas box in the shape of a typed
notice that the rent of their 7 by 9 (or so)
bedrooms is to be raised to 18s. per week
from January 1. This makes the fourth rise
in five years. The company, which still
trades under the Blood and Fire banner, is
rapidly turning the cheaply-acquired old
doss house into a sort of a kind of Hotel
Australia.
H #
“Bouragi”: “Parama’s” Papuan “bush
ropes” (B. 22/11/’23) are on the market;
known as rattan, they have a wide sale for
furniture-making, etc. Extra-big ones may
often be seen in Sydney streets when an elec-
tric-wire conduit is being cleaned out, Bft. or
10ft. lengths being screwed together. Papuan
traders used to buy the stuff years ago, what-
ever they do now, and gave good prices for
it. If “Parama” wants to get into the trade,
he will probably be able to do business with
Australian furniture and basket makers.
* * * *
“Bret Vane”: “Mendelian” is right in his
contention (B. 15/11/’23) that date-culture
demands a practised hand. Many a time, by
the Tigris, I have watched Mohammed Ali at
work fertilising his date groves. Mohammed
worked neatly and quickly, and as to the
manner born. Hanging from his belt was
a pouchful of the male flower, a sprig of
which he deftly inserted into the heart of
the flowery bunch of embryo dates that he
released from a spear-head sheath with a
delicate knife cut. Even the climbing part
is no light task; there were said to be
10,000,000 palms in 1916, and they grow
to a height of 60-80 ft. It is done with the
aid of a strap passed round the palm-stem
and the climber’s loins.
WHEN THE. BARMAIDS KNOCK OFF WORK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They are dressed like human rainbows, they ate fair
indeed to see,
Are the ladies, pretty' ladies, from the vespertinal
bar ;
When demobilised at even, from the pubs beside the
Quay,
What a. spectacle for wowsers Sydney’s glowing
barmaids are!
And before I go to prison for the third auspicious
time,
Ere I leave the pubs behind me where the beers
delightsome lurk,
I w'ould like to lift an anthem, lift a brave and
friendly rhyme,
For the girls who grip the beer-pumps—may they
never knock off work !
God deliver us from wowsers and from all the
gloomy tribe
Who have spoken disrespectfully of whisky and
of wine ;
May we never lose our barmaids —sing hosanna, every
scribe,
For the girls behind the beer-pumps are a spectacle
divine!
I am married, trebly married (I’m a bigamist by
choice —
I’m a heathen and a sinner and an undiluted
Turk),
So I am not after flappers, yet I lift an earnest
voice:
God bless our Sydney barmaids, may they never
knock off work!
I am middle-aged and hardened, I’m a youth of
forty-three,
With a baby son (God bless him!) who’s the
apple of my eye;
And my wife and I are happy with a bottle of
K.B.
(That’s the dear good wife I live with while the
others swear and sigh!)
And I simply rise to mention that the nights when
I come home
With the ice-cold bottled lager or the stuff where
bubbles lurk
Are the nights when Heaven’s with us as we lift
each glass a-foam ;
God bless Australia’s barmaids—may they never
knock off work!
At eleven in the morning, when a man feels like
a pot,
What a joy to life a pewter in a strong and
steady hand !
When a man is sick of figures and of merchandise,
God wot,
Doesn’t lager lift a music any fool could under-
stand ?
So I lift it here in public, plain where all the world
may see—
Lift an anthem for the ladies where the drinks
delicious lurk ;
Here’s a health to every sinner from Penrith to the
Quay,
And a tiger for the barmaids—may they never
knock off work !

Ready Rubbed or Plug Slice.
“Elloceum”: A Sydney housewife w r as re-
quested recently to furnish a few particulars
on a departmental form. When the docu-
ment returned it read as follows:
(1) Have you a private income? —Yes.
(2) If so, from where derived? —Baby Bonus.
“The Deacon”: “Ex-Dig.” (B. 29/11/’23)
needn’t go to Kilburn or any other place in
Britain for a coffee-service made out of
shell-cases, etc. Colin Smith, of Penrith
(N.S.W.), who was a corporal in the Somme
campaign, has the whole outfit made from
cases he personally souvenired.
Sir William Mercer, who gets a connec-
tion with Australia as chairman of the
Pacific Cable Board, has had a long history
in the British, Government service. He comes
of a tough family. His father, who was a
general, died in the hunting-field from a fall
from his horse at the age of 81.
“Wessel”: That reticence about be-
ing a survivor from the days of trans-
portation to Westralia was not shared
by some of the now extinct emigrants to the
Speck. Old Mary Crawley, who died at
Richmond (Tas.) at the age of over 100,
used to say: “I am the last old lag left in
Richmond, and I am proud of it.” It is
just possible that even now, after 70 years,
there is a transportee or two lingering some-
where in the Speck.
“Flyman” : When I hear some Yankee or
Cockney serio-clironic sing “Yarrawonga” or
“Croajingalong,” and urge a bored city audi-
ence to help with the chorus, I think fondly
of “Goorianawa.” A fine full-vowelled sound
had the title of that old shed song, and
lustily used the shearei-s roar the refrain,
“The way we had to knuckle down at Goo-
ri-an-a-wa!” “Banjo” Paterson included
“Goorianawa” in his collection of bush songs.
“The Banks of the Riverine” was another
shearing ditty now almost forgotten.
“Bunchytop”: Fat, forty and fairly
ferocious, she entered the studio and de-
manded that her photo: be taken. It was.
When we sent her the proofs she came back.
She didn’t like her hair plastered down on
her head. Could we frizz it up a little in
front? We did and sent her some more
proofs. That was much better. Could we
send her half a dozen done that way, and
could we put the American hair bob on the
other half-dozen? We did that, too. The
camera never lies. But there was a re-
toucher in Ananias’s family.
“The Deacon” : Archbishop Francis Red-
wood, of Maoriland (B. 22/11/’23), who
threatens to break all clerical records, is an
Englishman, born at Stafford in 1839 ; but
leaving three years later for the Shivery
Isles he has duly lived down his earlier
origin, and is now accepted as a dyed-in-
the-wool Maorilander. Before Dr. Viard,
the first bish. of the windy capital, called
it a day in 1872, he had nominated Red-
wood, then a professor of scholastics in the
seminary of the Marist Order in Ireland, as
his successor, and the young pupil of mission-
ary Father Garin (who had taken him in
hand in 1850) returned to M.L., to be soon
given a further lift as an archbishop and
metropolitan. Though physically not quite
as active as he once was, his intellect has
lost none of its brilliancy nor his fingers
any of their cunning with the precious Strad.
“Sturt”: W. A. Webb, the American-
trained Chief Commissioner of Railways in
S.A., has shown Adelaide another of his
commonsense innovations. The central
railway station is about to be rebuilt. Webb
called together over 20 of the leading archi-
tects in the city, and gave them a thorough
explanation of what is wanted. They were
then asked to send in designs, the best three
to get substantial prizes, and they are
allowed up till Christmas to ask for any fur-
ther information, the plans being returnable
by the end of March. Webb told them, in
particular: (1) They need not think about
the tracks, which are not in their depart-
ment; (2) it is hoped to keep the cost of
buildings down to £150,000; (3) they can
take as now settled the much-discussed
question of the station remaining a dead-end.
The “through” type gives rapid train hand-
ling; the “stub” type (as Webb calls it)
gives economy in construction and conveni-
ence to the public.
“Pohutu”: The Norwegian whaling enter-
prise which recently established itself on the
shores of the Speck as a base for operations
in the Ross Sea may give a new kick to the
languishing industry down south, as it has
already done in Westralia. The first whal-
ing outfits to use the Tassy coast as head-
quarters were those of Captains Fane and
Haggard (the latter a negro) ; with a brig
apiece they set up trying grounds at Fred-
rick Henry Bay in 1816. Others joined in
the hunt, and the industry kept afloat until
1847, when it sagged badly. It came again,
however, in the late ’sixties, and in 1878 put
up a record with £1,125,000 as gross return.
The wave of prosperity ebbed again at the
end of last century, and the figures since
then have not bothered Ivnibbs. In M.L.,
too, the business lias had many vicissitudes,
and at the present time the whaling stations
at Stewart Island, Cook Straits and Bay of
Islands are not doing much. The hardy
Norsemen won’t promise, but may look in
there later on.
“Second Murderer” interviews a “subject” :
Thirty years ago a much-boomed showman drew
crowds to Sydney School of Arts by, among other
mystic feats, sending a man into a trance for sever,
days. During that time, night and day, the public
was free to inspect the patient lying in his glass
coffin, doctors being especially invited. The victim
told me about it afterwards. “O’ course,” he
explained, “a man ’ad to lie dead stiff most of th’
day an’ w’en th’ gaff wasi goin’ at night, but
after midnight things useter get a bit slack. One
night—no, it was about 3 in th’ mornin’—l’d jus’
finished me supper an’ was ’avin’ a game of euchre
with one of th’ watchers, w’en th’ alarm-bell from
th’ bloke keepin’ nit in front goes off. Back I ducks
to me coffin, an’ in blows a old crokus —a doctor
—on ’ees pat. ’E opens one eyelid an’ jobs ’is
thumb in me lamp. Then ’e runs a needle through
me ear, an’ I never cracked boo! So ’e gives a
grunt an’ goes off satisfied. I’ve jus’ picked up me
’and o’ cards agen, an’ off goes th’ damn bell once
more. Back I lobs, an’ lies doggo, an’ blime! it’s
th’ old cow givin’ me a ongcore! ’E feels me pulse,
an’ then ’e jobs a lance down be’ind me finger-
nail. An’ even then I cracks ’ardy—there was
50 of-th’ best ’anginl to it. But w’en-th’ swine
’ad gorn, ’struth' I near made meself blush.”

Rexona Babies
The Pride of
Australia
The purest possible soap is required for
nursery use. The skin of infants and little
children is particularly apt to be rough-
ened and made sore by inferior soaps.
A number of the soaps sold for babies
are worse than useless, and as skin soothers
and healers they are positively injurious.
Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is the
purest of the pure. It can work nothing
but good for an infant’s skin, and its heal-
ing and soothing work will be noticeable
within an hour of application.
Mothers, if your baby shows signs of
fretfulness, try giving him a refreshing
bath with Rexona soap. Make him a
Rexona baby, and see the result.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BOLD symbol ill a painted dream
Of virile strength that mocks decay,
Making the far-past ages seem
Bat the high noon of yesterday.
The lore and legends of earth’s youth,
Of winged horse and Bellerophon
Rush downward in perennial truth
Like fountains fresh from Helicon.
Once by the law entire and whole,
Once by love’s fond accretion drawn,
High Heaven begat the Flaming Foal
In pastures fenced by Eve and dawn.
Still with blown strength and matchless
speed,
Vfar and too remote for sound,
Your brothers of the Blue stampede
Through Korean channels, azure-bound.
\nd here at the old call of kin
You stand and hearken to the neigh
Of wild sea-brothers charging in
From broad sea-llanos of the bay.
With unsheathed vision searching thus
The long, blown vistas of the shore,
Do you discern Hippolytus
And hear old Neptune’s sea-calves roar
Where the loose reins and futile hands
Beyond remede of human help
Are limply lying on the sands
Or coldly clutching tawny kelp t
Or have your eyes the power to win
Old trodden fields and reddened streams,
Swart Turkoman and Paladin,
And mailed crusaders from your dreams i
White Sultan, what seraglio
Of ancient Shah, or Sheik, or Khan,
Withered and loined and ribbed you so
To mount that mightier Corsican V
He shall come forth to bridle you,
To curb and to caparison,
And wake old weltering war anew
In sun and moon-mazed Ajalon,
While in your nostrils bites the reek
From affluent and sundered veins
And, wine-red at the saddle-peak,
The gauntlet slithers on the reins.
White as Marengo, blanched by Time,
Called from the Vasty Deep of old,
Your dam came headlong from the brine
And here, upon the wet sand, foaled.
And you hark back at the wild call
Of longings blood-inherited,
To see the white manes rise and fall
Like plumes of ages that are dead.
Brother to coursers of the Vault
And untamed chargers of the sea,
Like me, a moment here you halt,
A Shadow of Infinity.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
fr* HE cottage was a selector’s tiny home.
I Its living room, lined and ceiled with
white pine, looked like a huge pack-
ing-case. A miscellany of ornaments deco-
rated the sideboard ; a silver vase stood clieek-
by-jowl with a cheap alarm-clock on tne
mantelpiece, and a frying-pan lmng from a
nail that had plainly been intended ioi a
picture. One of the doors gave access to a
bedroom, in which was a disarray of feminine
clothing. Near the bed stood a tin trunk
tied with rope, and two suitcases.
Over one of the suitcases Mary Richards
knelt, a pad of kliaki-colored material pro-
tecting her knees, and packed mechanically.
Her thoughts were not on her task. She had
a letter to write. She was leaving her hus-
band ; and she wished to let him know all
about it.
Suddenly she uttered a cry of pain, rose
and threw aside the pad on which she had
been kneeling. It fell near the door, reveal-
ing itself as a Digger’s tunic. It was torn
and dirty, and the color patches on tne
shoulder were frayed and faded. A bent
“rising sun” betrayed what had hurt her.
“You hateful thing!” she exclaimed.
Mary Richards was 24, and had been mar-
ried five years. Her friends had called hers
“a romantic marriage.” When the war. broke
out she had thrown over a lover who had
said that only fools enlisted, and married a
man who was going to fight for his country.
She glared at the tunic. A romantic mar-
riage, indeed! She wondered what her friends
would say when they knew that she. had
gone away—and with the man who believed
that only fools enlisted.
She felt that she could manage that letter
now. The encounter with the tunic had
done it. Sitting on the side of the bed, she
wrote feverishly:—
Dear Jack, —I am leaving you. Our marriage was
a mistake.
That was right. It had been the fault
of the war. That rotten war. The excite-
ment had made her do it —the excitement of
seeing the troopships go out, the excitement
of the uniforms. And he was as much to
blame as she. He had really taken advantage
of what, after all, was only a girl’s whim.
It has been- nothing but unhappiness ever since.
You remember that time I wrote to you in Egypt
asking if you minded my having a decent dress 9
That was because father was picking at me about a
dress I had bought. He said he was not letting me
live at home so that I could spend your allotment
money on flash clothes.
A nice thing for a father to say! And her
about the streets practically all day doing
war work—collecting and selling things and
so on!
Of course I told him that it was his place to
keep me when you were away fighting for him. I
did not tell you this before because
No, indeed! It was bad enough to have a
father like that without letting everyone
know about it!
because I was ashamed of what father said. I
am only telling you now to let you see what I have
had to put up with. I never felt comfortable at
home after that. The people jiip here have had me
set ever since I came. They fairly hate me. I know
why. It is because I am too good for them. That
was why they would not let one of their girls come
and work here. They said they would not let them
work for anybody. It was not that at all. They
wanted me to be dirty and wrinkled and have lough
hands like them.
Aud she had thought she was doing them a
good turn offering to take one of their kids.
They evidently didn’t want them brought
up decently. What else could you expect
from people who had been nowhere and seen
nothing!
If you want to do me a good turn, Jack, you will
show them this letter. I want them to know wnat
I think of them. And ask them ifi/they and like me
to send them a pattern of that navy dress I wore
into town with you that day. Jack, even if I live to
be a hundred, I will never forget
She laughed. It was over that dress she’d
had the row with her father. Thirty guineas
did seem a lot to give for it then. But how
it had worn ! And a nice chance she’d have
of ever getting another dress like that if she
stayed on in the bush!
—their faces. They hated me that day if ever
they did, for showing them what a dress could and
should be. I bet the women put that old man up to
say what he did to you about the profits of the
farm going on my back. The old thing looked
sorry he spoke
They didn’t think she’d heard wliat he said.
She soon let them see their mistake. The
grin came off their faces when she stormed
at them : “That dress was bought with money
earned in a way none of you were game to
earn it!” They wouldn’t forget her in a
hurry.
when 1 had finished with him. Of course they
were hinting that I had all the clothes and you
had none. Do you remember that day I told them
that I had told you to get a suit with that money
you got for the skins of those cows that died, and
they seemed to think it a joke when I said that
it was a sort of windfall —money you did not expect ?
They did not know where to look when I said that
you had done right when you bought pigs with it.
They knew what I meant. They are pigs, just pigs!
I can’t understand how you can put up with them.
No, she couldn’t. Yet he seemed to like them.
He said that people in the bush had to help
one another, and that he had to depend on
them for information about farming. Not
for hers! She’d rather die than be beholden
to them for a single thing.
I wouldn’t have them on my mind a minute. How-
ever, it has been an experience for me. Now Jack,
I don’t want you to fancy I have anything against
you. But I don’t think you ever understood me. 1
don’t like dragging these things up, now that lam
going away, but 1 must tell you that you seemed to
think more of your old farm than of me. I suppose
it was right what you said about having to go away
and work to get money because your own crop was
no good. But it did seem funny that you had to
go 10 miles away. Wasn’t there any place nearer?
If I have had plenty of time to think of these things
it is your fault. From five in the morning till
eight at night is a long time to leave your wife,
Jack.
And yet if he hadn’t gone! How different
things would have been! What a strange
chance it was that her old lover should come
travelling for machinery the very day Jack
started to work at Jobson’s! And what a
mercy she hadn’t said anything about his
coming! It was Jack’s fault that she didn’t,
too. She probably would have told him if
he hadn’t gone to bed directly after tea.
You can’t blame me for going. T hate the place.
I can’t stand the loneliness, and the idleness, and
the monotony.
She stopped, and on a sudden impulse tore
the letter across. “What a fool I am!” she
exclaimed. “Giving myself away!” Why,
it looked as if she was going away with
Robertson only to escape from the bush —that
she’d have gone with anyone else —whereas
the truth was that the hand of Providence
was in the whole thing. She was being
offered complete happiness—with the man she
loved —had always loved! It was almost too
beautiful to think of! Really, the ways of
Providence were wonderful.
She got up from the bed wondering whether
her husband would divorce her. She didn’t
see how he could do anything else. It w’ould
be cruel of him not to when he knew she had
always loved Robertson, and would have mar-
ried him but for the war. Thank God,
Robertson didn’t go to the war! He had
shown his sense. He had stuck to his job,
and now he was his firm’s country traveller,
and had his own car. When she thought of
what her brothers had got out of the war —
one maimed, the other always sick —and what
Jack had got out of it, she wondered how she
could have been such a fool as to urge anyone
to go. Well, she had paid for it. Her
martyrdom was a judgment on her.
The torn sheet of paper had fallen to the
floor. She picked it up and tore the pieces
again and again and put them in her pocket.
She wondered what time it was. The
clock showed a quarter to four. Only a
quarter of an hour! There would be no
time to write now. It didn’t matter. She
would write from Sydney. She could hardly
believe that she’d be in Sydney to-morrow.
She smiled as she thought of how Robert-
son had said that it would be like a second
honeymoon for her.
She was about to go back to the bedroom
when wheels sounded on the road outside.
As she listened they stopped, then sounded
again. She looked out the door. It was the
mailman, and he had left a letter. She
could see the end of it sticking out of the
biseuit-tin nailed to the gate-post. She hur-
ried to the gate. Perhaps it was from her
mother. She had written to her mother a
week before, not telling in so many words
what she purposed doing, but hinting that
they might expect her soon. Why didn't
her parents sympathise with her? Probably
because they didn’t understand what she
had to put up with! But how could they
understand? They lived in the city—in the
midst of everything. .
She took the letter from the tin. The
writing on the envelope was not her mother’s.
It was in pencil and so faint that she could
barely read it. The address struck her as
strange. “Mrs. Mary Richards.” She wasn t
Mrs. Mary Richards. She was Mrs. John
Richards. She had never had a letter ad-
dressed that way before. The stamp was
cancelled with the town postmark of that
day’s date. In a flash she knew. It was
from her husband! Had he found out?
She tore at the envelope and glanced
through the sheet of paper it had contained.
Then it fluttered from her fingers, and with
a cry she threw herself upon the bed.
“The brute! The brute !” she wailed, her
face buried in the pillow.
She was still sobbing when a car pulled
up at the verandah. A man got out, came
quickly into the bedroom, lifted her up and
set her on her feet, kissing her as he did so.
“What’s the matter, little girl? Any-
thing happened?” . x
She drew back from him and pointed to

Is a dull, constant backache spoiling your life? Do sharp
pains stab you at every sudden move? Are you so tired
and down-hearted it seems you just can’t keep going?
Don t be discouraged! You wouldn’t feel so badly
without a cause; and more than likely the cause is weak
kidneys. Not any organic kidney trouble, perhaps, but
a slowing-up of the kidneys and the resulting accumula-
tion of poisons that well kidneys would have filtered off.
Is it any wonder then, you feel so run-down, nervous and
depressed? That you are subject to frequent headaches,
dizzy spells and annoying bladder irregularities? Then,
why not give the weakened kidneys the help they need?
Why wait for some serious kidney trouble? Use Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. Doan’s have helped thousands.
They should help you. Ask your neighbor 1
EXPERIENCES OF SYDNEY PEOPLE
Mrs. J. Maxwell, 17 Hansard Street, Waterloo, Sydney, says:—“lt
gives me great pleasure to say a few words in favor of Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, this remedy having completely cured me of a bad attack of
kidney disorder some two years ago. I suffered dreadfully for some time,
and was often so bad with backache that I was obliged to lie up. I could
get nothing to give me ease from the constant pain, day or night, and it
was fast taking all the life and energy out of me. The kidney secretions
were affected, being thick and cloudy, with a red sediment, and there was
puffiness under the eyes, this, I knew, being a sign of dropsy. Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills acted splendidly, giving me relief in a few days, and,
as I continued taking the pills my health rapidly improved, three bottles
making a perfect cure.” .......
Six years later Mrs. Maxwell confirms her previous statement, and
says:—“l have had no return of kidney trouble since Doan’s Pills cured
me eight years ago. I have great faith in this medicine, and always keep
a bottle in the house.”
Mr. Henry Francis, 2 Oxford Street, Burwood, Sydney, says:—
“Eighteen months ago I commenced to feel off color. A slight scalding
of the secretions began and gradually grew worse until they were intensely
painful, and I could not retain them. A pain then crept up my back and I
suffered torture. I went into the hospital and was treated there for nine
weeks, and although I came out a little relieved I was still in pain, and a
week later was as bad as when I went in. By accident I came across a
pamphlet about Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and after reading it I
resolved to give this remedy a trial, so sent for some at once. The first
bottle did not seem to do me much good, but I persevered, and while taking
the second bottle I got a little ease, and four bottles completely cured me.”
Twenty years later, Mrs. Francis says:—“My husband has great
faith in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and always keeps them by him.
This medicine cured him many years ago, and it always acts beneficially
whenever he has occasion to take it.” .

the letter. “Read that,” she said hoarsely.
He read from it aloud. “Am leaving you
.... give you chance to get divorce.... only
myself to blame. ... life never suited you.—
Jack.”
He paused, then exclaimed: “Why, little
girl, he couldn't have done better if we’d
asked him !”
Her eyes blazed, and she looked at him
much as she had looked at the tunic.
"Do you think I'll stand that? He has
thrown me over for some other woman!”
“He doesn’t say so. There are other ways.
Desertion—but why worry? That’s his busi-
ness. We’re wasting time. Get the rest of
your things in—shall I take this trunk?”
She wiped her eyes and sat down on the
bed. “Leave that trunk alone,” she said, so
sharply that he wheeled and faced her open-
mouthed.
“What”
T m not going with you, Mr. Robertson.”
Robertson’s face flushed. “Not going?
What the devil”
Please don’t swear. I’ve told you I’m not
going. That's all. Get out!”
He shrugged his shoulders and turned to
the door. In the doorway he paused.
What are you going to do ? You can’t
st *>y fiQ'e all night by yourself.”
. Don’t let that worry you. I’m used to
it.
. When he had gone she finished her pack-
ing, and later caught the mailcart into the
township and the train to Sydney. And as
the train rushed along through the night
the rattle of the wheels on the rails seemed
to be saying, “A martyr ! A martyr !” Yes,
she mused joyously, she was indeed a martyr
now. Deserted by her husband ! That was
the thanks she’d got for her years of loyal
self-sacrifice in the bush. Her parents would
understand and sympathise at last! A good
woman and a pure wife thrown over, flung
aside! The infamy of it!... .They’d have
to keep her when she showed them Jack’s
letter, and keep her well! And she might
get something out of him too! How beauti-
ful to be back in Sydney!
Once, for a few moments, she pictured
Robertson and his discomfiture. But these
thoughts quickly vanished, dispelled by the
gracious sound of the wheels saying, “A
martyr! A martyr!”
VICTOR LIPSCOMB.
The Judge.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE charge was murder, and yet the
interest in the case was slight. The
facts were too clear. A man had
been robbed, and then kicked to death. The
murderer's toes were still tingling from their
impact with the back of his victim's neck
when the police had appeared.
That the friends of the accused had money
was shown by the counsel they had employed.
The Judge wondered idly what line Long would
take. He had from the first felt an interest
in the prisoner, and it had grown during the
hearing. There was something vaguely fami-
liar about the youngster—something about
his delicate features which seemed to chal-
lenge the Crown’s horrible charges; about
his strong figure, and erect, defiant carriage.
The odd sense of familiarity was easily
explained; no doubt the lad had already
been before him. And yet And yet
As the Judge listened to the evidence his
eyes wandered again and again to the face
of the boy in the dock, always with an un-
easy feeling of recognition.
fie stirred to a more alert interest when
Long commenced his address. As he had ex-
pected, the barrister was appealing to the
jury’s sympathy. The Judge smiled grimly,
lie was a hard Judge, and he knew that in
his summing-up he would have to point out
that the jury were sworn to find according
to the evidence; that sentiment was a thing
they must keep in the background. Never-
theless, as he glanced again at the accused,
he felt that his sense of recognition had
warmed in him a degree of sympathy for
the man, brutal though he might be. He
found himself hoping that Long would make
the best of a hopeless case.
Suddenly Long's argument took a new
form:
“The punishments the law inflicts often
fall upon the wrong persons. I have shown
you the circumstances under which the
accused—a. young man still—has been
brought up; surrounded by viciousness
given no sense whatever of the morals which
we pride ourselves upon ; born and bred to
be an outlaw and an outcast. He is unable
to say who his father was. Cast into the
rough places of life where the guidance and
control of a father was most needed —the
son of a mother whose nature probably was
such that to eliminate the weak, vicious ten-
dencies he inherited from her a father’s care
was most necessary—he grew up to manhood
foredoomed to the position in which he is
placed to-day. Is it fair to apply to him
the judgment that might be applied to one
who had had the advantage of a moral train-
ing? I think it must be felt, by anyone
who has a heart to feel, that the man who
is really guilty of the crime of which this
young man is accused is the father who,
careless of his well-being, neglected him in
his childhood —the man who, careless of the
character of the woman with whom he spent
liis hours of dalliance, was responsible for
bringing this unfortunate young man into
the world, was satisfied afterwards to leave
him in her harmful keeping. I say that
that man, who is probably in a comfortable
—possibly a distinguished—position is the
one who is morally entitled to be in the dock
to-day!”
The Judge’s hands gripped the arms of his
chair. That likeness! Now he knew.
The youngster in the dock was what he had
been at the same age.
With a cold fear moving behind the mask
of his face his mind swept back to an old
folly. The woman had been bought off. And
then the news had reached him that their
child was dead. What he thought, yet dared
not think, was ridiculous !.... Absurd ! He
would assert himself.
“Mr. Long, in the interests of your client, I
wish to give you every latitude. But the
facts”....
He paused, lost.
“If your Honor pleases, I want to
show”
He proceeded to show it, uninterrupted—
to show how the actual responsibility lay not
with the accused, who was a moral weakling,
and had never had a chance to be otherwise,
but with the progenitor who had left him
chanceless in the world. The Judge,, meeting
the advocate’s eye, had seen in it a challenge.
It seemed that Long was saying to him, “I
know ! I know !”
He was appalled. It was agonising to have
to maintain his composure, with the feelings
that were rioting within him. The barrister
was picking his words with deadly effect.
The picture he had painted of a child with
a life made hopeless by careless begetting and
a neglectful father was true. He, the Judge,
had been just such a father. The boy had
died —fortunately. Of course, he had died.
But for that this young man, this creature of
blunted sensibilities, a brute and a thief,
might have been his own son—the brother
or the son and daughter of whom he was so
proud. But, of course, the boy had died. .. .
He suddenly sensed something that stiffened
his nerves. Undoubtedly Long knew. He
was speaking now not so much to the jury
as to him. He thought by probing an old
wound to compel a sympathetic summing-up.
Well, he would fail. Justice was justice:
even if it was his own son his summing-up
would be the usual cold, calm exposition of
the law of the case.
Even if it was his own son! The thought
struck with a cold, sick horror. He stared
at Long. The barrister had developed a
habit of sweeping his arm outwards. He
had never known it before, and it seemed
curious. His eyes followed the sweep when
next it occurred. The court became blotted
out. Below him he could see nothing but
a woman whose bloated face and figure were
those of a woman he had once known.
The time had come to sum up. With a
supreme effort he recovered himself. He
was a Judge. The law was the law. Long
should not triumph over justice. He turned
to the jury.
“You are here to give your verdict on—
on facts,” he began. “It is necessary, in
order that you may arrive at a just verdict,
that you shall free your minds of sentiment.”
And then the words flowed on easily to
the end.
“Cold blooded,” he thought he heard some-
body whisper.
Cold blooded ! He was not cold blooded as
he paced his room, waiting for the verdict.
Asj a Judge he had done his duty ; and in
doing it he had condemned liis soil—no, the
young man who looked as his son who was
dead might have looked. His own flesh!
Supposing Reggie had been left in babyhood
to a woman without morality, to spend his
life in evil surroundings, why, Reggie—even
the boy of whom he had such hopes—might
be to-day in the other man’s place. The
thought sickened him; and yet the boy who
had been neglected deserved the most sym-
pathy. But of course it was not.... The
child had died.
He called his tipstaff.
“Nesbit,” he said, “there is a woman in
court, in the front seats —overdressed—
painted a bit —peroxide hair. A pink blouse
—silk, I think.”
“I saw her, sir.”
“Find her address for me.”
He resumed his fevered pacing; and,
assure himself as he might, he still came to
the blank conviction that lie had ;been duped
in the news of the child's death. His son
guilty of murder—doomed to spend his life
as a felon! He groaned in bitterness.
“The woman’s gone,” reported Nesbit.
The Judge stared at him, and struggled
for composure. lie must return to court
soon to receive the verdict. Nesbit, tactful
ever, ignored his discomposure.
No one would have credited the inward
tumult which afflicted him when he returned
to the Bench, received the verdict of
“Guilty,” and pronounced sentence. The
seizure that came upon him immediately
afterwards gave the evening papers a sensa-
tion.
Long had heard the chug of the Judge's
motor-car outside his house. He was
amazed at the change in his visitor’s once
vigorous appearance: at his whitened hair,
his hollowed cheeks, the anguish in his eyes.
“Good God, what’s the matter?”
“I’m resigning. I can never try a man
again. And I had to come to you. There’s
something I want to know that I think yon
know. About that young man Cashel you
defended.”
“Oh, yes; Cashel! That was a hard fight.
They’ve commuted his sentence, of course.”
“Long, somewhere or other you’ve learnt
something about me. You tried to use it
to influence me. Well, if you do know,
just think what my feelings are! The
woman was in court. Did you bring her
there?”
The barrister bit a cigar. He was un-
comfortable.
“In a sense —yes ! Newcome and Dawes,
the solicitors, had got to know about her;
and, seeing the line I had to adopt, they
thought it might be useful to have her
there, to remind —to have her there, any-
way.”
“Tell me. Was that young man—Cashel,
her son?”
Long smiled.
“Of course not. They thought the boy’s
resemblance to yourself, combined with the
presence of the woman, might have some
effect. But I never dreamed you would
take it seriously. Don’t you know that
her child died —Good Lord, fifteen, twenty
years ago!” "
“I knew! I’d been told ! But I thought,
for some reason, I’d been duped. Are you
sure. Long? The young man” :
The Judge who had won a reputation for
harshness looked pitiable in his weakness and
his appeal.
“As a matter of fact,” said Long, “Cashel's
father is known to us —a perfectly honest
farmer in Queensland.”
A rush of futile anger swept into the
Judge’s face.
“And it was all a trick!” he moaned. “A
trick!”
Then his anger choked in a sob. He
tottered, blindly reached a chair by the table,
and fell forward with his face on his arms,
the mental agony he had gone through finding
vent in a convulsive burst of tears.
