NOTES.
To make children acquainted with the
cardifxal points of sex-relations is a duty in-
culcated by the New Woman on the old
mother. The principle is probably sound,
though its application should., always dis-
criminate. “Ignorance is not innocence.”
Neither is knowledge ; and the risk of titil-
lating precocity by measured information is
almost as great as the risk of creating it by
silence. Health, constitution, character,
circumstances —a thousand things should
alter conduct according to individual cases.
When enlightenment is judged desirable,
there is now quite a substantial body of
literature (mainly American) to point out the
mode. A recent sample, “ Baby Buds,” a
booklet by Ellis Ethelmer, is supposed to be
addressed to a child four years old —which
is tough on the child four years old. E.g. :
“The female flower now begins to fade
away, but the ovary or fruit continues to
swell and increase ; the ovules also absorb
sap in the ovary and grow up,” &c.
Unlucky infancy is expected to assimilate
this ! Decidedly, there are no lengths to
which woman, old or new, will not go when
dominated by a fixed idea. Yet “ Baby
Buds,” kept for a little elder age, supplies
the anxious mother with some excellent texts
for translation into nursery vernacular.
Sept. Scribner’s Magazine starts with
“ A History of the Last Quarter-Century in
the United States,” which gives a striking
glimpse of corrupt politics from a reformer’s
point of view. A particularly well-illustrated
article shows how photography may be
applied to fiction, and seems to suggest that
a reversion to the prehistoric picture-writing
system would not be without its advantages.
Chapman’s Magazine for August deserves
special commendation as one of the best
literary budgets ever offered at the price (Is.
posted). The contributors are Bret Harte,
Edwin Pugh, Eden Phillpotts, C. E.
Raimond, F. C. Phillips, lan Maclaren,
Mary E. Wilkins and Violet Hunt ; and the
quality of the work is undeniable.
Saturday Review deals tenderly with
poet Parkes. “ That his sonnets, are in-
teresting as poetry,” it says, “it may be too
much to assert, but they are certainly curious
as human documents.” And, adds the re-
viewer, “let us be thankful that Australia
boasts no ‘ blood-stained Jeffries.’” Hm !
Anew illustrated London weekly, which
will not let a photograph appear in its
columns, is to be called the Unicorn, and
issued this month. A. JH. Girdlestone is
literary, and Raven Hill art editor.
From Curzon’s recently-published “ Pro-
blems of the Far East”:—“ln a country
like China the institution of sisterhoods
planted alongside of male establishments,
the spectacle of unmarried persons of both
sexes residing and working together, both in
public and private, and of girls making long
journeys into the interior without responsible
escort, are sources of a misunderstanding
at which the pure-minded may afford to
scoff, but which in many cases has more to
do with anti-missionary feeling in China
than any amount of national hostility or
doctrinal antagonism. Only last year,
at the remote inland town of Kuei-
hwa-cheng, a friend of mine encoun-
tered a missionary community con-
sisting of one male and of 20 Swedish
girls. The propaganda of the latter con-
sisted in parading the streets and singing
hymns to the strumming of tambourines
and guitars. The society that had com-
mitted the outrage of sending out these
innocent girls only allowed them 200 dollars,
or £27 10s. a year apiece for board, lodging
and clothing. Asa consequence they were
destitute of the smallest comforts of life,
and could not even perform their toilette
without the impertinent eyes of Chinamen
being directed upon them through the paper-
screens. Can anything be conceived more
futile or more culpable than such an enter-
prise?”
The exceedingly pretty “ Temple Shake-
speare,” now issuing in 40 pocket vols., at
£2 15s. the set, posted, can be warmly
recommended to anyone who wants a really
good edition. Twenty-three vols, are already
DO hand, and the remainder will follow by
monthly instalments.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, theundersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HE ARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W, G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir,—Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a booh that cannot be too widely
knovvn ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir, —I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
.and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&0., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,

fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently

restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.

tent to fully describe your case, send Gd. in

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any otner medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical G-entleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY

Baron Berzilius’ -
Buclni Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. : —The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. 1 therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and-
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.
How’s Steane’s Bitters.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, ‘ so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
215 Pitt-street.
Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs,
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANET WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION. —When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

We wish it to be understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely inclusive variety of the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
Ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
Of confidence in the truth of what We say) when we dub

PUBLIC) BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life—honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
nevercease from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
somewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

Shapely nails, an unblemished skin, and luxuriant
hair are produced by the Cuticura Reme-
dies when all others and the best skin doctors
fail. In the treatment of the simplest forms of facial
blemishes, or the severest humors and diseases of the
skin and scalp, with loss of hair, even when complicated
with hereditary or scrofulous taints, they are equally suc-
cessful. Everything about them invites confidence. They
are absolutely pure, and may be used on the youngest
infant. They are agreeable to the most refined and sen-
sitive. They are speedy, economical, and unfailing.
CUTICURA
Remedies afford instant relief in the most
distressing of itching, burning, and scaly skin
diseases. They cleanse the scalp of dandruff,
scales, and crusts, cure itching humors, destroy
microscopic insects which feed on the hair, and
supply the roots with energy and nourishment. They
restore the pores to healthy action, and thus remove
the cause of pimples, blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin.
They heal rough, chapped, and fissured hands, with itching palms
and painful finger ends, and remove the cause of shapeless nails.

DARRELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
So I ve taken his hundred notes in the end,
And now, as I turn them over,
I feel like a man who's been false to a friend,
Or has broken his troth to a lover.
And what will they purchase, when all is said,
For me with the world’s wealth laden ?
A barrel or two of Kaludah red,
Or the favor of some light maiden !
'^ l -ixTL , ' ne^urns ,e S ra y day’s birth
When the lamp of the revel paleth ;
We know what the kiss of a woman is worth —
But a good horse never faileth.
Your white arms clinging, my ringless bride,
Are bonds that the years will sever;
But the brave hoof-thunder of Darrell’s stride
Will beat in my heart for ever !
You know how little of truth there lies
In the heart of your hot caresses,
There is danger hid in your dreamful eyes,
There is death in your winding tresses ;
And, since you would turn for a fairer face
Or a stronger arm’s enfolding,
You will never hold in my heart the place
That one honest horse is holding.
The stars are fading by one and one
And the fires of the dawn are lightening
The web that a pitiless fate has spun,
And my own cursed hand is tightening)
Oh ! better this arm had lost its force,
This brain in the dust lain idle,
Before I bartered the grandest horse
That ever carried a bridle !

THE SHEARING OF THE FLEECER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
a western township in Queensland two sundowners
got at " a shanty-keeper for £2O or £3O in the following
manner. .. . Vide western papers.
Is he from the backblocks ? Comes he here in
peace ?
lls he Union ratter—twig his hairy teeth ?
Comes he from the burning, smeared in kerosene?
Keek his hands of bloodshed—of a lamb just
weaned ?
Are those greenhide uppers off a stolen beast ?
Gosh ! what length of shin-bone —what enormous
feet!
Long and lank his hair is, merging into beard ;
Shaggy are his eyebrows—is he to be feared?
Piercing black his eyeballs; suddenly they change ;
Reins his rusty moke up—stricken bad with
mange.
Yes ! he sees the sign-board hanging on the post,
Hears the syren “Hullo, mate” of the anxious
host.
“Just a beer and a bit of prog, must get on to-
night,”
Not the least intention of even getting tight.
Gum ! he’s got a drought on judging by the way
He swamps that she-oak liquor, guess he’s on to
stay.
See him in the morning, beer in every pore,
Leering at a stranger riding to the door.
“Damme, here’s the Ripper—working mate o’
mine,
Both been cuttin’ tanks for Jones on the Conda-
mine.”
“G’arn, you drunken Fenian, you stole my
blarsted cheque,
An’ you an’ I ain’t settled quite another matter
yet.”
“Your cheque’s all ri’, old pard ; old pizen-seller
here
Has got it in his cash-box—let’s have a glass of
beer.”
From one they get to many, all enmity was sunk,
The Ripper and his partner were most completely
drunk.
When daylight chased the shadows from off the
shanty wall,
The Ripper’s partner had ’em, and had ’em pretty
tall.
The Ripper tried to soothe him, ’twas waste of time
indeed —
He’d a keg or two inside him, and not a bite of
feed.
By noon the Ripper’s mate had fled into the
scrubby range,
The Ripper sobered slightly, from the landlord
got his change.
The cheque was in the fifties and the Ripper’s
share was half,
Which the honest shanty-keeper handed over
fairly smart.
For the Ripper in his dungeon at his mate’s
attempted theft
Told our friend to keep his jumping share—got
both the mokes and left.
On the road from Oallangolly, when the dingo
raised his yell,
The Ripper and his grinning mate were riding
thro’ like .
At the shanty stood the squatter ; the cheque was
forged and bad ;
Just listen to the curses of the man the Ripper
“had.”
There’s a moral in this little fact. I’ve often
heard it told
The man that’s being “got at ” isn’t always him
that’s sold.

“ Yankee Doodle, ’’ blended with Politics.
The above is, of course, a caricature of the famous American national picture, which will be
given later on.
“YANKEE DOODLE ” is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobacco that has ever
appeared here, and it has won greater success during the short time it has been on the market than
anything previously. This is no idle boast, and, to prove it, any smoker can test the statement for
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its’sale
has this year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this!
Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes, after
years of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended and
exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf is
forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he ha*
been accustomed to. DIXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-.century to accomplish' this ; and. as
their leading business has been built up on their reputation for QUALITY, they could not afford to
make the foregoing statement if any doubt existed. DIXSON & SONS, who use more American leaf
Uian all the other Tobacco Factories combined, are noted for several high-class brands- “CON-
QUEROR,” “SIR ROGER,” “CHAMPION,” and “DOLLARj” bub “YANKEE DOODLE”
ranks supreme.

The Victorian Railway Problem.
During the recent lean years of depression
the railway - deficit has been the great
stumbling-block in the way of the Victorian
Treasury, Since the close of the unspeak-
able Speight regime, stupendous efforts have
been made to cut down the expenses of rail-
way management, but though much has been
done in this respect it has been found im-
possible to overtake the decline in receipts,
andayawning shortageof £3Bo,oooper annum
has still to be met out of public revenue.
The Turner Government therefore ap-
pointed still another Parliamentary Com-
mission to find out new devices for running
the railway on commercial principles, and
the Commission, which seems to have done
its work remarkably well, has sent in a
report bristling with suggestions for further
economy. It proposes to save £85,000 by a
general reduction in wages ; £103,000 by
abolishing free passes and charging the other
State departments for services now rendered
gratis ; £107,000 by closing some of the rail-
way workshops and concentrating the car-
riage-building and repairing industries in
one or two large establishments, and £70,000
in other ways ; thereby reducing the annual
deficiency to practically nil. Also, it sug-
gests that still another effort should be made
to abolish political interference by placing
the railways under the control of a board of
independent trustees. In the old days,
before the advent of Speight, the Vic-
torian Ms.L.A, haunted the railway offices
day and night to get billets for their friends,
relatives, and constituents, or to get them
promoted, or to get their salaries raised, or
to get them reinstated when they had been
“ sacked ” for drunkenness, embezzlement,
or other offences, or to get new stations,
sidings, gates, sub-ways, reduced fares and
freights, free passes, extra trains, special
trains, &c., &c., to beg off constituents who
swindled the department out of their fares,
and many other concessions. Speight was ap-
pointed chief manager with extensive powers
in order to abolish this evil, but under his
festive regime it flourished very much as
before. It flourishes still under his sue-
cessors, hence the proposal to establish a
new form of independent control. The
Parliamentary Commission believes that,
when its recommendations are carried out,
Victoria will at last have arrived at those
commercial principles which it has been so
long striving after, and its railway system
will become a solvent concern, and the
annual deficit will trouble the laud no more.
* * *
Meanwhile, the voice of the person who
wants to lease the State railways to a British
syndicate is again beginning to be heard at
intervals. It is one of the fixed delusions of
some alleged Australians that a gang of
private speculators could work the country’s
chief asset at a profit under the same condi-
tions in which the State works it at a loss ;
that it could take over the lines at their
present valuation, and reduce fares and
freight-charges, and maintain the existing
rate of wages, and keep everything in
good repair, and maintain a regular service
on all the hopeless little branches which
Gillies constructed in the boom era, where
the traffic doesn’t even pay working expenses,
and that it could also realise handsome divi-
dends, and make everything bright and
prosperous. Therefore, there is a frequent
and idiotic demand in certain quarters that
the State should live up to this wholly
imaginary standard of excellence. At pre-
sent the State runs the Victorian railway
system to much better advantage than any
British syndicate would be likely to do, and
the insistence on purely “commercial prin-
ciples,” under the existing circumstances, is
a very large demand indeed. Victoria has
already nearly five times as much railway in
proportion to population as Great Britain
and Ireland, and its lines are being extended
faster than population increases. Its total
mileage of iron-road is one-seventh that of
the United Kingdom ; its receipts are con-
siderably less than one-thirtieth ; therefore,
it has to face the problem of meeting all
liabilities out of much less than one-fourth
the proportionate revenue. If it were pos-
sible to stop construction until population
increased by, perhaps, 25 per cent., the
deficit, under the present system of manage-
ment, would vanish of its own accord. But
todo this it would be necessary to give the pro-
posed trustees the sole power of construction
as well as of management. They must be
authorised to shut down on every suggested
line which could not show a certainty of
profit. When the mallee farmers explained
that a railway was essential to develope the
new country and carry their produce to
the coast, the board, on purely com-
mercial principles, would have to answer,
as a British syndicate would certainly do,
that it doesn’t care a straw whether the
country was developed, or whether the pro-
duce reached the coast or not—that its sole
business was to make the railways yield a
profit. It is not proposed to give the
trustees any such power, and it would be
both foolish and ruinous to do so. But
these are the commercial principles which a
private syndicate would certainly have to
adopt.
The Victorian railway-system, as already
mentioned, is five times as large, in propor-
tion to population, as that of the United
Kingdom, and has just about one-fifth of
the traffic. The people demand that it
should be made to pay all expenses and
interest on cost, and yet they want more
lines in empty regions where the want of
traffic* will further increase the deficiency.
The fares charged in many of the districts
around Melbourne are already lower than
those in some localities around London, and
there is a constant demand for further reduc-
tions. Also, the fares and freights over the
Vic. lines in general are a shade lower than
those in New South Wales, and considerably
lower than those in Queensland, Tasmania,
Westralia, or Maoriland. With four or five
times as much railway in proportion to earn-
ings, and five times as much in proportion
to population as the United Kingdom, Vic-
toria continues to work its lines with the same
proportion of expenses to receipts as do the
Great Eastern, Great Northern, Lancashire
and Yorkshire, and Manchester, Sheffield and
Lincoln companies of England, and it spends
£59 in working expenses out of every £lOO
earned, against an average of £57 for all
England. And if the outlay for pensions—a
charge from which the English private com-
panies are almost wholly free—is deducted,
then the Victorian railways, despite the
rather higher wages paid and the much
shorter working hours, are run at a slightly
lower charge for working expenses in propor-
tion to earnings than the English average.
These results appear—on the surface, at all
events —as if they should be sufficient to
satisfy the public demand for management
on commercial principles.
* # *
For the year just ended the Victorian
lines paid 3 per cent, on the amount borrowed
for construction purposes. This is a higher
rate than that earned by ten out of thirty-
two leading British companies, and but for
the exorbitant interest at which these bor-
rowings were effected—most of the money
being still owing at 4, 4£, and 5 per cent. —
it would be almost sufficient to cover all out-
goings. And it would be quite sufficient,
despite the high rate of interest, but for
the rascally manner in which the original
cost was swelled by the resumption of land
at from twice to twenty times its actual
value. The situation under which the new
era of management on commercial principles
is to start may be summed up in a few
sentences : The province has five times as
much railway in proportion to population as
Britain—the country that is always referred
to as a standard of comparison ; and no
country in the world with so much railway
to so little population has yet succeeded in
showing profitable results. The fares and
freights are below the average, and the people
who insist on the department paying its way
also insist continually on further reductions.
Whenever the railways show any signs of
approaching solvency, they are swamped by
the addition of new lines which don’t pay
more than a fraction of their working ex-
penses ; and yet Parliament won’t part with
the right of making new lines, and the
nation certainly wouldn’t let it do so even if
it wanted to, and if the Legislature did part
with the right it would almost certainly hand
it over to some one quite as foolish as itself.
The railways have to pay interest on at least
one-third more capital than they should be
burdened with, owing to the dreadful land-
resumption jobs of the past ; but for this
fact they would be a highly profitable pro-
perty even now. Also, they have to find £4
per cent, interest on this huge capital,
whereas the private lines of the United
Kingdom only contrive to produce an aver-
age of £3 12s. per cent. ; and in addition to
all this they have to pay higher wages and
maintain a lower standard of working hours
than the British companies. In the face
of all these conditions, the people who pro-
fess to believe that the leasing of the lines to
a foreign syndicate will remedy everything
are very sanguine, or very ignorant, or very
anxious to make commission out of the
transaction.
# * *
If the Parliamentary board of enquiry has,
as it believes, discovered a method by which
the system can be made solvent, despite the
enormous burdens which have been piled on
it by the muddled or dishonest politicians of
past days, then it has done remarkably well.
The fact that no railway - system equally
burdened has yet paid its way, is no reason
why the Victorian one should not be the
first to do so. And if Parliament will enact
that the outlay on future railway construc-
tion must be limited to a certain amount per
annum, so as to bear some relation to the
increase of population, and that all land-
resumptions must be based on the valuations
made for taxing purposes, so as to put a
definite end to the worst swindle of all, and
will apply the betterment principle in future
construction, then it is probable that it will
keep solvent wken it has once reached that
desirable state. And even if the annual
shortage can be limited under present con-
ditions to, say, £200,000 per annum, then
the desired state of solvency will come in
course of time, as the old loans fall due and
are renewed at a lower rate of interest. But
the assumption that the natural condition of
every railway-system is to pay its way, and
that its failure to do so is a certain proof of bad
management now, is an absurdity. Also, the
further assumption that because a few English
railways, under very different conditions,
pay reasonably good dividends, therefore
there is some magic in an English syndicate
which would enable it to put everything
right, is a still greater absurdity. The syn-
dicate, if it arrived, could only put things
right by reducing wages, increasing working
hours, raising fares and freights, shutting up
unprofitable lines, working the paying por-
tion of the system only, and leaving the
State to make pioneer lines in new localities
and stand the loss. English syndicates, as
evidenced by the Maoriland Midland Rail-
way fiasco, are about as stupid as other com-
binations ; and English railway-managers,
as evidenced by the disastrous Speight, are
sometimes even worse than the “colonial”
article.
A Tory on Sweating.
The anti-sweating measure, now proposed by
the Turner Government as an amendment of
the Vic. Factories Acts, finds ample support in
the arguments urged against it by the Argus.
That sapient journal has ruined many a cause
by advocating it, and the pity is that the
waning influence of the Argus makes its oppo-
sition to a good cause less and less valuable
each year. One of the large lies that it now
puts forward with characteristic boldness is
that “ the true remedy for sweating is to restore
the ‘colony’ to prosperity.” It ought to be
evident, to even a right-minded person, that
prosperity has been the ruin of Victoria. Infla-
tion of trade, from whatever cause arising,
means, as things are, inflation of laud-values
and the boomsters’ opportunity. For a mad
year Davies and Bent and their pals live on
champagne and chicken, and Munro and
Balfour drink inordinate quantities of lemon-
ade and tea—and the land-sales multiply apace,
with free whisky and buns for the wretched
buyers. Then comes the smash, and the
depression, hunger, sweating, and other ills,
• * •
Next lie is, “ Take the taxes off raw materials
. . . and sweating will disappear.” The
existence of sweating as an abuse in Freetrade
England is a piece of such commonplace know-
ledge that only a reckless journal like the
Argus would attempt to hold out against it.
Sweating commissions have been appointed in
England again and again. The London County
Council found it necessary to legislate a mini-
mum wage as a safeguard against this evil.
The last deceased British prince was stated to
have caught his fatal illness from clothes made
in a sweater’s den. Kingsley and Tom Hood
wrote their philippics against sweating as it
existed in their time ; and as it exists now.
Sweating can only occur when a needy worker
meets an unscrupulous contractor, and this is a
condition of things that is independent of Free-
trade and of Protection. Sweating is the
necessary effect of competition, and unrestricted
competition is the beginning and end and
middle of the old Manchester school doctrine.
But this lie that the tax on raw materials causes
sweating in Victoria is not only a false de-
duction from facts, it is also a wanton and pro-
fligate perversion of facts. The two worst
sweated trades in Victoria are bread-baking
and the manufacture of underclothing. Flour
is, of course, a local product and a large staple
export; cotton piece goods from which the
underclothing is made are free of Customs.
When the Argus tells the sweated baker and
the wretched woman who sews shirts at 9d. per
dozen that the cause of their wretchedness is
Protection, it is bidding almost too high for
the Tory support.
• * *
The third lie is that the restriction of factory
work to the factories, as proposed by the
Government, is an injustice to hundreds and
thousands of women. The report of the Vic-
torian Sweating Commission showed that the
perpetual menace to industrial employment in
these sewing-trades is the fact that employers
can give any pittance they please to their
wretched employes when they deal with them
separately. The homework must be regulated.
If a woman with domestic responsibilities is
compelled to earn money she can obtain a
permit, but she will be given a schedule of
rates that are obligatory on her employer. It
is on evidence that women have had to press
their infant children into the service of the
sweater, the sum-total of a family’s work being,
perhaps 9s. or 10s. a week. In one case, a child-
of five years old was found helping its mother
by sewing on buttons. To regulate this sort of
thing, the Argus says, is to interfere with the:
liberty of the subject. When the liberty of the
subject means the sweating of the subject it is-
time for a total revision of economic dogmas..
The Tory political economy is not economy at-
all—it is parsimony to the worker and prodi-
gality to the capitalist. We live in the dark
ages as long as the employe’s extremity is the
employer’s opportunity, and the louder the
Argus howls against a change, the sooner it-
will come.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Our Cheap Chinese Clergy.
Rev. Dr. Torrance, of Melb., charges a’
number of Vic. congregations with sweating
their pastors. He says there are 43 ministers
without parsonages receiving stipends of £2OO
a year or under, and 24 with parsonages and
stipends of £l7O. This doesn’t seem (consider-
ing that good, sound sermons may now be
bought at the rate of 2d. per lb. or thereabouts)
such dismally bad pay in these times. It
should always be remembered that parsons are
—on account of certain prejudices connected
with the nature of their calling—saved many
expenses which fall upon the average man.
They are not expected to “shout” for their
friends when they meet them in the street, nor
to “ put a shilling in ” at Yankee-grab, nor to
take an occasional hand at cards, nor to play
billiards now and then for “drinks and the
table,” nor to take shares in racing-sweeps, nor
to “dip in the lucky-bag” at church-
bazaars, nor to subscribe to charities,
nor—many other things which need not
be mentioned. Then, again, it is generally
looked upon as a grave scandal if a parson
smokes in public—consequently one who is
fond of his pipe can hardly consume more than
a cake of tobacco per week unless he sits up all
night to smoke. So that, taking all these
things into consideration, a parson with £l7O a
year and a house, or £2OO without a house, is
probably better oft'than the average layman with
£3OO a year. Before Dr. Torrance gave vent
to the Bitter Cry of the Underpaid Clergy he
should have thoughtfully reflected upon the
exemptions enumerated. A more trenchant
criticism, however, than any The Bulletin
has to offer in regard to his Bitter Cry, ap-
peared in the Age last week in the shape of the
following matter-of-fact telegram :
BAIHNSDALE, Tuesday.
Oh Sunday afternoon last a new Chinese ('impel was
opened here in connection with the Presbyterian Church
by the Rev. T. R. Cairns, of Ballarat. The building cost
about £l2O, and the whole of the cost was defrayed by
Paul Young, a Chinese missionary here, who has saved
t'-~* amount during 10 years from his annual stipend of
£36.
In other words, Paul Young managed to live
on £24 a year for 10 years ! Dr. Torrance
might do well to take this fact also into serious
consideration. He seems to think that the
present condition of the clergy in Australia is
pretty grievous, but when cheap Chinese-
parsons who can live on 9s. a week are pouredi
into the country he will probably begin to see
that there is an economical side to the noble
Chinese martyr-missionary question. If Chris-
tian men and women are willing to lay down,
their lives to convert the Chows, and are sent.
out from Australia (with much hallelujah i
and hosannah) for this very purpose, the
reverend gentlemen who give them such gush-
ing and soulful send-offs can hardly have the
face to complain if their own business is even-
tually brought down to the ‘level of cabinet-
making or market-gardening ifi consequence of
the competition of cheap Cho,w parsons. Andl
let it not be taken for granted Ihat the scope of
these latter must necessarily be confined to-
work amongst their own race in Australia. The
fundamental doctrine taught by the missionaries
is that the yellow man and the white man are
equal in the sight of Heaven. Immediately
the yellow man, who has taken orders, finds
this out by practical experience to be a fraud,,
the bottom will fall out of the missionary trade
for evermore—so far, at any rate, as the Chow
is concerned. It may happen that the clergy
of the next generation will curse with as much
fervor the folly of their predecessors who sent
missionaries to China as squatters and selectors
now curse the man who first introduced thistle?
and rabbits.
Ware Herring!
Let this be clearly stated : no possible issue of
the Dean embroglio can affect the public con-
demnation of the Judge who tried Dean.
Dean’s guilt or innocence has nothing whatever


to do with Judge Windeyer’s capacity or in-
capacity. In summing-up the case on July 6,
immediately after Dean was released on the
recommendation of the Commission majority,
The Bulletin said :
Dean’s guilt or innocence is possibly even now a matter
of conjecture. But Justice does not act on conjecture.
Justice demands that, before a man is imprisoned, his
guilt should be proven ; and Dean’s guilt has never been
proven.
The logic of the situation remains unchanged,
and would so remain if Dean had made a
thousand real or alleged public or private
confessions to as many real or alleged lawyers.
It is not charged against Judge Windeyer that
under his auspices an innocent man was im-
prisoned. It is charged against Judge Win-
deyer that under his auspices a man whose
life was at stake had only the mockery of a
trial. It is charged against Judge Windeyer
that under his auspices, and at his instigation,
and perhaps in consequence of his veiled threat
to imprison the jury from Saturday night to
Monday morning, a man who was possibly
innocent, who was certainly never proven
guilty, was doomed to penal servitude for life ;
so that the country had to interfere, at a great
cost, to redress the injustice aided and abetted
by Judge Windeyer, the servaht of
Justice. It is charged against Judge
Windeyer that Dean, as a victim, does not
stand alone; but that from the case of the
wronged Mrs. Butler (whom he divorced on
the evidence of her husband, the now-convicted
perjurer, and the detective-perjurer whom the
Kerjured husband hired) back to the case of the
fount Rennie youths (convicted before him
after a JEEEREYS-like travesty of a trial, and
mainly on the evidence of two people now
known to be an arsonist and a forger), His
Honor has blotted his career with examples
of what, in any other man than a Judge,
would be branded as obstinacy, incapacity, and
bias. It is charged against Judge Windeyer
that, no matter how good his intentions, he
has sapped the confidence of Parliament,
People, and Press, in the administration
of justice, and it is declared that the time has
more than come for him to retire from the
Bench which his conduct has surrounded with
odium and distrust. And, though every man
in Australasia become as confident that Dean
poisoned his wife as if he had seen him do it
with his own eyes, the gravamen of these
charges will not be lightened by one iota.
Two Months.
Whatever the communication Meagher made
to Salomons, that communication was abso-
lutely confidential, and was obviously intended
so to be considered. According to Salomons’s
own account, his disclosures involved, prima-
facie, anyhow, a breach of professional honesty
(or etiquette, if you please) as between client and
lawyer—worse, as between lawyer and lawyer,
as between two members of a profession bound
in its intercourse to most scrupulously observe
the code of honor and the etiquette of gentlemen.
Salomons pleads that the public interest o verrides
private and professional etiquette and honor.
Undoubtedly it does, but, as Salomons was so
chivalrous a guardian of the public interest,
why did he delay so long to make Meagher’s
statement public ? He says that Meagher
told him of Dean’s alleged confession on 18th
July, and the facts do not ooze out till 26th
Sept., after an interval of more than two mouths.
The brilliant Salomons should tell us where was
his anxiety for the public interest during those
two months. He saw, from his point of
view, a scandalous miscarriage of justice.
He saw a guilty man the recipient of public
honor, and innocent women the objects of
public reproach. He saw the intelligence of
his friend Judge Windeyer and his friend
.Attorney-General Want and his friend Rogers,
•Q.C., held up to public derision ; he might have
seen that tough trio gnawing their flesh vainly
in agonised search for a weapon of defence.
Yet apparently Salomons made no sign ! He
was repositary of the momentous secret of
Dean’s confession for upwards of two months—
;and never let on. Was he waiting for Meagher
to take action ? But two months ! Was he
(torn by contending scruples ? But two
months ! Two months ! two months ! two
months ! What was Salomons doing during
those two months ? If the responsibility doesn’t
lie with him it does with Want. When did
he tell Want? Two months! “The public
interest ” —after two months ! Guilt con-
founded—after two months ! Innocence jus-
tified, the acumen of Windeyer, Want, and
Rogers defended—after two months ! Holy
Moses ! two months !
A Yankee Notion.
The Vic. Railway Board was so pleased with
itsown appointment,at £sperdayeach member,
that it recommended Parliament to hand over
the railways to just such a body as itself —for
modesty’s sake, names not being mentioned.
The Board flatters itself that the principles of
running a private concern necessarily ensure
dividends, and that the application of those
principles to a State concern spells success.
During the enquiry, numerous references were
made to the U.S.A. railways as an example
either of economical management, of wise
management, or of reputable management. In
U.S.A. private enterprise has a new country
and a scattered population to work on—in
Victoria the same conditions obtain, only more
so. The U.S.A. railways, for the year ended
30th June, ’94, paid the half of 1 per cent, on
their capital cost. The Vic. railways, for the year
ended 30th June, ’95, paid 2’74 per cent. on their
capital cost. The burden of capital in all shapes
on the U.S.A. railways is 10,796,473,813d015.
On this amount the dividends declared during
the twelve months were 95,575,976d01. ; but
only 55,755,970d01. of this amount was pro-
vided out of the year’s earnings, the rest being
drawn from accumulations or from anticipated
earnings on good boom principles. The Vic.
returns show that the earning power of the
railways under State management leaves private
management at a discount of 500 per cent. But
it must be further considered that Vic. has had
the free use of the State railways for all sorts
of services for which a private co. would have
demanded cash down ; if these services were
reckoned to the credit of the department, as
they should be with a decent system of book-
keeping, the railway account would appear
more healthy. Moreover, there is no railway
line in Vic. that has not produced in land-
increment double the capital cost of construc-
tion, and there is not a mile that is not saddled
with corrupt charges for State resumption
which have made heavy the pockets of the
land-owner. The Vic. trouble is not to make
the railways pay, but to make the land-owner
repay.
The Dean Case Commentators.
Last Friday, when only the ex-parte statement
of Salomons was before the public as to the
alleged guilt of Dean and his alleged confession
thereof to Meagher, and the latter’s alleged
repetition of the confession, the S.M. Herald
already began to whoop for the gallows in its
good old Mount Rennie style :
The extreme gravity of the position made out by the
circumstantial narrative of Sir Julian Salomons pleads
for a suspension of judgment until the statement in reply
which may be expected from Mr. Meagher has been put
in an equally explicit shape before the public. But, quite
apart from any question upon which Mr. Meagher may
be expected to throw any light, we may be permitted to
refer to the support which this recent development ought
to give to the regular and legal way of determining ques-
tions of guilt or innocence as compared with the method of
trial by oratory and public meeting, of which the Dean
case has afforded such signal illustration.
On the same day the Telegraph took up the
parable thus :
One of the bases of this movement was the allegation
that Dean had been the victim of an improper trial, and
during its progress statements were made in and out of
Parliament reflecting the deepest discredit upon the
administration of justice. For a solicitor to lend himself
to such a proceeding as this, well knowing that it was all
in the interest of a guilty person, and for the purpose of
screening him from the legal consequences of his guilt,
whatever it might be professionally, would, in other
respects, be capable of no excuse.
The Herald’s attitude is explicit and blood-
thirsty. Salomons’s statement is not by itself
sufficient evidence to convict Meagher of con-
cealing the truth, but it is sufficient to show
that Dean should have been hanged. The
Herald suspends judgment as to Salomons’s
truthfulness, but on the trifling matter of
Dean’s guilt, which depends in this instance on
Salomons’s accuracy, it makes up its mind
at once. Its theory is practically that the next
man who is convicted on wholly insufficient
evidence should be hanged because Salomons
says that he has been told that the last man so
convicted deserved hanging, while, at the same
time, it urges the public not to rely on Salo-
mons’s statements until further proof is forth-
coming. And the Telegraph’s attitude is that
if Meagher knew Dean to have been convicted
on wholly insufficient evidence, but also knew
that in this case the law bad gone right by pure
accident, he should not have raised any protest
against the method of the trial—which is
illogical drivel. The matter at issue was not
that Dean was innocent, for no one can sav
with certainty that anybody is innocent, but
that he hadn’t been proved guilty by reason-
able evidence, and that if the mode of trial,
under which he was convicted, was allowed to
continue there was no safety for anybody
whether guilty or not. Dean’s innocence or
guilt was, and still is, a matter of the smallest
importance. Even if he is proved guilty now,
the Windeyer variety of justice remains as bad
and as utterly indefensible as it was before.
Betterment.
Maoriland Legislature is making its third or
fourth attempt to pass a Betterment Act, but
at present with little prospect of success.
Everybody admits that when the value of the
property in a particular district is greatly
increased through the construction of a railway,
or a road, or a harbor, or through the opening
of a new street, or the widening of an old one,
or any other work constructed at public
expense, it is quite fair on principle to make
the owners contribute some of that increase in
part payment of the work. But it is constantly
pointed out that the roads and railways in the
older and, therefore, the richer part of the
province, have been already made in times
when no one thought of applying the betterment
system; that the people of the backblocks have
to pay their share of the interest on these works;
and that it is unjust to make them pay a special
tax for their own roads and railways in addi-
tion to paying their full share for those of their
neighbors. In other words, it is claimed that
the country shouldn’t begin to do a thing unless
it has been doing it all along. There is a cer-
tain semblance of unnaturally accurate justice
about this theory, but then mathematical jus-
tice can’t be arrived at in anything, unless the
universe can be put back to the year One and
everything started afresh. If the country waits
to be mathematically just before it does any-
thing, then it will do nothing. And, in
any case, no one knows to a dead certainty
what is justice. The law fines the very
aggravated drunk 405., and the man who
runs an illicit still £lOO, but no one can say for
certain that to run an illicit still is exactly 50
times, and not 37, or perhaps 63 times, as bad
as the other thing. And when the law fines
the moderate drunk ss. and the rather worse
one 10s., it doesn’t pretend to know for certain
that one of them was exactly twice as objection-
able as the other—it only strikes an average.
This world is full of averages, most of them
very bad ones. Still it is often better to strike
even a bad average than not to strike anything
at all.
The Return from the Gutter.
There has probably never existed any genera-
tion that didn’t delight, up to a certain point,
in hearing itself described as more hopelessly
corrupt and desperately wicked than any gene-
ration that had gone before it. But as it was
certain to entertain, at the same time, a com-
fortable underlying conviction that it wasn’t
anything of the sort, and that, in any case, it
was just as righteous as it had the chance to be,
it was pretty certain also, sooner or later, to sit
down hard upon the author, or the playwright,
or the crier-aloud on the house-tops who was
unduly persistent in painting its morals of a
deeper blue than it really believed they were
entitled to. And the present generation, ac-
cordingly—having outlived the titillation of
being told that its wife is for the most part a
strumpet, and its bosom-friend a designing
scoundrel, and itself incapable of a lofty thought,
or a wholesome aspiration, or a disinterested
action—is beginning calmly to turn its back upon
the stamp of play and of book in which, by im-
plication, it has of late been asked with damn-
able iteration to accept this version of the circum-
stances. The average man, knowing perfectly
well that he is an average man—neither re-
splendeutly virtuous nor exorbitantly vicious—
and that society is mostly composed of average
men, knows consequently, also, that society
cannot collectively run much to either of these
extremes. For which reason he is as uncon-
vinced by bogus immorality as he is by spurious
holiness, and is getting desperately weary of
that dilettante depravity in literature and the
drama which he has all along shrewdly sus-
pected to be no more than a sort of inverted
snuffle—hypocrisy spelt backwards ! Neither
need he be artistically the loser. The most
complex human interest is generally evolved
from the least complex psychological materials,
and the neuro-erotic exploitation, for instance,
of sexual sophistications about which the vast
majority of men and women—untroubled of
morbid introspectiveness—persist in concerning
themselves not at all, has produced no work to
take rank with that of the men who have turned
to immortal account the perfectly normal
development of perfectly commonplace condi-
tions. The belief, also, that mankind, in the
main, possesses a fair share of common honesty
and common decency has so obstinately refused
to perish under these elaborate attempted
demonstrations of its futility that it may be
pretty safely set down as something more than
a mere conventional assumption. And, even
were it otherwise, no end would be served by
its destruction. The man who thinks he has
got rid of all his illusions—has but gained an
illusion the more !
The Lash—An Exploded SupersuaEauj*.
From The People (London) July 14th, 1895: —
Use of the Lash. —From an article in St. Paul’s it
seems that the “Myths of the Middle Ages” which have
been exploded by Mr. Baring Gould by no means exhaust
the list. The writer of the article referred to deals with
“The Use of the Lash,” which every now and again is
publicly credited with stamping out the garrotting
epidemic of the early sixties, and he proves from the
records of the defunct Social Science Association that the
Flogging Acts were introduced after the garrotting
epidemic had been practically overcome. Lord Abbrdarb
was Under-secretary to the Home Department in 1862,
and this is his testimony: “ That the singular outbreak
of garrotting which occurred in London in July, 1862,
was entirely suppressed by the ordinary action of
the police, who watched closely those parts of
the town where the offences were mainly per-
petrated before the winter set in, most of the
ruffians who practised violence being then safely laid by
the heels, and that the flogging Acts introduced in the
session of 1863 effected no reduction in crimes of violence
whatever. So far from there being any decrease in rob-
beries with violence during the six years that followed
the passing of those-Acts, there was, if anything, a slight
increase.” “A genuine mystery,” says the writer in our
contemporary, “ in connection with the garrotting scan-
dal is why this class of offence should have flared up into
extraordinary prominence in the autumn of 1862, only to
die out again within a very few months. It was not a
new crime, and although at the period I refer to several
public men and other well-known persons fell victims to
it, there is no reason to suppose that in 1862 it became a
more lucrative pursuit than it had ever before been.
Be the explanation what it may, the social rank of
a few of the victims attracted much attention, and put
the police on their mettle, with the result that the greater
vigilance of the authorities, and the heavy sentences
passed upon the offenders, stamped out the strange
epidemic with unexampled rapidity. That was the fact.
Why, of all the weapons of the law, should the lash alone
be held in respect by the criminal classes? And why
should garrotters only respect it? If it is useful to sup-
press one class of crime why not all crime ? The truth is
that public confidence in the lash as a deterrent is one of
the strangest superstitions that has ever possessed the
public mind. Let us hope it is now exploded.”
The Extraordinary Synnot Case.
The Synnot divorce-case, which thus far has
had the effect of throwing three Melb. consta-
bles out of employment, promises to produce a
huge official scandal presently. These three
policemen, it will be remembered, were “ tried”
by an Enquiry Board, consisting of Mr. Ake-
hurst, P.M., and two others, on a charge of
“ recklessly swearing” to the presence of Mrs.
Synnot at a certain alleged brothel in Carlton
(Melb.) during a time when, on the showing of
Divorce Court evidence, the lady must have
been in England. It was not a satisfactory
enquiry, from a common-sense point of view.
The constables, admitting that their story was
flatly contradicted by more or less convincing
proofs, desired to show good excuse for their
error in the fact that a dozen other casual wit-
nesses had made the same mistake. For some
reason the Enquiry Board declined to allow
this testimony. The constables were dealt
with as three unsupported, reckless tra-
ducers of Mrs. Synnot’s character, and their
dismissal from the force ensued. Thereupon
the Synnot case of mistaken identity was
written up by a barrister, whose account
was circulated in the Vie. Assembly. The
result of this light on the subject was a demand
to know whether the Crown Law Department
intended to take proceedings against all wit-
nesses who swore to having seen Mrs. Synnot
in Carlton at the time of her alleged residence in
England. The question challenged a re-opening
of the Synnot case. Premier Turner replied
that the Law Department “saw no evidence to
charge any of the persons referred to with
criminal intent,” and there the matter dropped
in the meantime. The constables are dismissed,
without being disgraced. Had all the witnesses
who shared their unaccountable error been civil
servants, they too must have been cast from
their billets unless the Enquiry Board had con-
descended to notice that, where so many are
deceived, none can be severely blamed for falling
into the general error. Very little reflection
should convince any intelligent thinker that
there is virtue in numbers as regards
witnesses in a case of mistaken identity.
The Synnot divorce-case, on the surface, was a
husband’s desperate attempt to get free at any
cost. In the first instance, Mr. Synnot pleaded
his wife’s desertion (with a .£lO,OOO settlement
in her pocket) as the sole ground for a divorce.
He was put out of court by his own deed of
separation, and subsequently he returned to
the attack armed with allegations of his
wife’s uuchastity during their long separa-
tion. These allegations were disproved by an
alibi. Mrs. Synnot, it seemed, had been
12,000 miles away from Carlton at the time of
her alleged residence there in a house of ill-
fame. Also, it was denied that the house ever
had any ill-fame. Altogether, Synnot cut a
very unsatisfactory figure in this second abor-
tive suit for divorce, and the world considered
him a wild, vindictive suspector of the lawful
wife who wouldn’t live with him. The true
facts of this second suit are not on the surface,
however. Mr. Synnot didn’t hunt up charges
against his wife’s honor. They grew out of
the original “ desertion ” suit, and were brought
to him by people who smiled at his ignor-
ance of matters which they (as they thought)
were well aware of. These volunteers
waited upon Synnot’s solicitors with various
tales relating to Mrs. Synnot and the
aforesaid house at Carlton. They agreed in
swearing that the house had an immoral
character in the neighborhood, and that Mrs.
Synnot was undoubtedly one of its inmates for
a while some years ago. They had recognised
her in court, or elsewhere, during the first
trial. Naturally, Synnot applied at head-
quarters for the names of policemen who were
on the Carlton beat at the time referred to.
Three policemen were named, and they, being
asked what they “ knew” about Mrs. Synnot,
declined to open their mouths without autho-
rity from the superintendent, or chief commis-
sioner, or somebody. The authority was forth-
coming. Then the three policemen joined the
chorus of allegation against Mrs. Synnot, and
so got into their present trouble. They also
were prepared to identify Mrs. Synnot as a
one-time lodger at a house of assignation.
It was their misfortune to have watched
the house, together with the scandalised
neighbors, in days of yore, and to have
firmly impressed upon their memories the
face and figure of a female whom they
now recognised without doubt, as they thought,
in the person of Mrs. Walter Synnot. This
is the story of a remarkable case of mistaken
identity, not apparently of reckless swearing,
and it explains why the Crown Law Dept.,
although sanctioning the policemen’s dismissal,
sees “ no evidence to charge any witnesses with
criminal intent ” —a very ingenious way of put-
ting it, anyhow. But there is a sequel to the
story. When the three policemen were being
sat upon by the Akehurst Board, fresh wit-
nesses volunteered a firm opinion that Mrs.
Synnot is the counterpart of the Carlton
sojourner. They had heard of the letters
proving that the lady was in England at a cer-
tain time, nevertheless they planked down their
honest belief that she is indistinguishable at
this distance of time from the person they saw
at Carlton. Mrs. Synnot has been the victim
of an exceptionally remarkable resemblance
to another woman. That’s her misfortune,
and three policemen are suffering for it.
The indications are that the man Johnson,
convicted of perjury in the notorious Butler
divorce-suit, which unexpectedly sprung some
alarming surprises on the public, will have his
condemnation endorsed by N.S.W. Executive.
The reconsideration of Johnson’s case has been
one prolonged farce. How invidious to place
a minor and junior Judge in a position in which
he might have to pass adverse judgment on a
superior and senior Judge, and to rebuke
inferentially the Attorney-General, and the
lawyer-Premier of an Executive in which there
are five lawyers or quasi-lawyers, with the
Lieut.-Governor as Chief Justice and colleague
of the Judge whose judgment would be impugned
by Johnson’s release ! For weeks the enquiry
was dragged along ; then Minister Gould wrote
“a minute,” which, judging by inspired press
expressions, was “ several hours ” long ; and last
week Premier Reid solemnly assured the
Assembly that he ‘ * was reading ” the docu-
ments “as rapidly as he could,” while his
colleagues would also have to read them.
O’Sullivan, M.P.: “In the meantime the man
is suffering.” Reid (blandly),: “He may have
to continue to suffer.”
The Age discourses on numerous baseless
charges lately brought against men by hys-
terical females in a manner not calculated to
please the W.C.T.U. and other vice-sniffers: —
Mrs. Potiphar, when urged to revenge merely by an
unappreciative swain, is not nearly so dangerous as a
woman in pursuit of pounds, shillings and pence, or a
young girl in whom a faulty physiological and psycho-
logical equipment produces hallucinations and delusions.
Unfortunately, there seems to he a marked tendency to
such hysterical developments among the Australian
women, although we have not as yet reached
the stage where a physician is afraid to see
a female patient except in the presence of a
nurse, as is the case in some American cities. ... It
is well-known that modest women will, when under the
influence of anaesthetics, indulge in language from which
the vilest of mankind would shrink, and it was recently
stated by a Victorian school-inspector that immodest
pictures and words were more frequently to be found in
the girls’ than the boys’ buildings. The experience of
hospital authorities is similar, and the cold bath and
electric battery have frequently to be applied to female
patients to reduce their amatory hysteria, just as the
Abrahams family was cured of malingering.

The N.S.W. Upper House rejected the Bill for
its reformation by a large and bad-tempered
majority, and this week it proceeds, in a soured
frame of mind, to consider the Land and
Income-tax Bills, the new Customs tariff, and
the proposed loan for forest-thinning and build-
ing the Bogan bridge at Monkey. If the coun-
cillors remain in their present aggravated state
they will probably reject some of these
measures, or alter them out of all recognisable
shape, and then there will be a most interesting
deadlock in politics. For though the people
gave a reasonably distinct “ mandate ” for
the reformation of the Legislative Council, and
though there is a big Government majority
in the Assembly, it is really no easier
to reform the Upper House than it was before.
The present members won’t reform themselves.
The Governor, it is at least ten chances to one,
won’t consent to appoint 40 more members to
carry the reform scheme, the average Governor
being a person who dislikes violent excitement.
The British Tory Parliament, it is at least
twenty chances to one, won’t interfere ; and
the old men of the Upper House won’t die off
fast enough to remove the present hostile
majority within any reasonable time. The vast
blubbery inertia of the Constitution is against
Reid, whose situation in this matter is about as
unpromising as that of the person who tries t<?
convert a Chinaman.

Miss Juliet Flegeltaub Wray made her
f|rst Sydney appearance under hard conditions.
She caught a violent cold to begin with, and the
opening of “ Madame, Angot ” had to be post-
poned while she stayed at home and coughed her
glossy head off in strict seclusion, and had her
dainty feet put in hot gruel, and mustard plasters
fixed on her. When she did appear she was only
half recovered, and the rain came down in a
deluge, and Sydney was like the Great Dismal
Swamp, and the Lyceum was barely half-full.
Yet, despite all this, Juliet Wray was a pro-
nounced success. She made a bright and clever
Cilairette all through acts I. and II.; but in act
111. she carried the house by storm, and the air
grew thick with the heavy, excited breathing of
Israel,,and the new star had more encores than
she knew what to do with. The revolutionary
ballad which Clairette gets off her mind before she
is dragged away by the surreptitious policeman
with the blackened eye was sung quite as well as
it has been done in Sydney for many years past,
but Miss Wray’s triumph arrived when she ap-
peared in a brief striped skirt, and two limbs
which are a great deal less scraggy than „was
generally expected, and announced in melody her
resolve to follow in the footsteps of her sainted
mother. As an actress, Juliet is considerably
above the operatic average, so far as can
be judged from the results up to date,
though she makes casual mistakes here and
there as the result of zeal and inexperience.
She has an excellent voice, a graceful figure, and
two expressive eyes set in a not unhandsome
countenance ; also, she dances remarkably well,
and if she doesn’t fly off the handle, as the result
of too much early success, she should become a
star of magnitude.
* * »
This week Miss Wray is suffering a tem-
porary eclipse in the “Old Guard,” which is
Lauri’s opera almost exclusively, and affords very
little room for anybody else. Lauri has fixed up
sundry new tricks since his last appearance as
Polydore, and makes the “Guard” one continuous
yell of mirth from first to last. Miss Juliet Wray
fills the tight uniform of Patatout in a way
which does honor to those historic pants, and
May Pollard and Florence Young represent the
two girls who got mixed in infancy. The
former, .as the principal mixed girl, strikes
a very large patch indeed. The male -parts
of the oast are much as they were befere.
On Saturday and Monday “ Nitouche ” and “ An
Arcadian Eve ” will be presented together if the
co. can get through that stupendous double bill,
and “Dorothy” and “Paul Jones” will follow
for two nights each.

Mr. Dacre and Miss Amy Roselle com-
menced a short season at the Criterion on Satur-
day with the evergreen “ Scrap of Paper.” Why
these two brilliant comedians failed to catch on
better during their last Sydney season is one of
the mysteries of this complicated and ill-managed
globe. The fact that they are only doing mode-
rate business now is another darksome conun-
drum that will never be explained until the sea
gives up its dead in a shocking state of damage
and with prawns in their hair. The “Scrap of
Paper ” is a bright and healthy comedy, and the
acting of the two principals is as nearly faultless
as the rather depressing circumstances admit.
Miss Roselle is especially to be commended as one
of the very few ladies who can fill a comic part to
perfection, the average comedienne being about as
really humorous as a, ton of coals. Mr. Plimmer
takes Scot Inglis’s 'old character as the,weary
baronet, and though his natural energy pre-
vents him looking so artistically weary as his
predecessor, he fills the part sufficiently well. Miss
Kate Bishop’s Aunt Zenobia is a work of genius in
corkscrew ringlets, and Blanche Carlyle’s bright
smile is alone worth the admission-money. There
are several morals in the “ Scrap of Paper,” and
one of them is that it is safer to aggravate the
tiger in his lair than to go fooling around with the
wife of a depressed and torpid-looking baronet.
Torpid baronets are dangerous when roused. An-
other moral is that when the average woman is
calling on the other fellow and suddenly hears her
husband thundering on the stair with murder in
his footsteps, she always hides in the next room,
which is a supremely foolish proceeding, as that
is the first place where he looks for her. At such
a time as that, the really intelligent woman crawls
under the sofa.

Her Majesty’s (Sydney) re-opens on Satur-
day under the lesseeship of Alfred Woods and
Mrs. Marshall. The first production is “The
Prairie King,” by Garnet Waloh, a hair-raising
shriek in four acts, with the biggest tank ever
seen in this country. It is billed as “absolutely
the greatest, spectacular production ever placed on
the Australian stage,” and one cheering circum-
stance connected with it is the fall of a horse and
rider from a bridge into the aforesaid tank—the
astonished quadruped coming'down a distance of
20 feet. When he strikes the water he makes the
biggest splash that ever happened south of the
line—or at least he ought to, if he is any kind of
a horse. Mr. King Hedley, “ the renowned
American actor,' whom The Bulletin doesn’t
remember hearing about until now, is the star,
and the scenery is reported to be, next to the
splash and the tank, the greatest event in this
hemisphere.

Last week Prof. Kennedy gave a test ex-
hibition of his mesmeric powers to the medical
profession and the press of Sydney, and after the
medical profession had carefully inspected the
dismal “ subject ” who chews the raw onion and
goes up in the imaginary balloon, it decided that
he was absolutely genuine. The Bulletin, so
far, hasn’t worried much about the genuineness of
the subject; its prevailing impression has been
that the show—which is still prospering amaz-
ingly—is a ghoulsome exhibition, and its prevail-
ing desire is to give the Professor a dead cat on
his birthday. As a comprehensive expression of
its views on the subject that defunct animal covers
the ground better than a whole essav.

Something went wrong with the luvin
’usband in “My Sweetheart’’ one night last week,
and the part was filled very creditably by Mr.
Frank Hawthorne at a few minutes’ notice. The
previous luvin’ ’usband recovered next day, or
had the tooth stopped, or got something done to
whatever it might be that was the matter with
him, and the show has since progressed as usual.
The comedy burlesque “ Revels ’’ is announced for
next Saturday.
** * *
The Rickards co. , at Sydney Tivoli, an-
nounces that its huge attraction for Saturday will
be the Banvard Family, and English comedian
John Coleman is to be turned on two weeks later
(October 19). In the meantime the prospect of
John’s advent will help to keep up the community
in its progress towards a brighter sphere, as men-
tioned in the hymn that they sing in church while
the plate goes round and the button is being put
in it. The Empire was still alive when last heard
from.

Sydney’s new music-hall, “ Tattersall ”
Adams s Palace of Varieties, to be erected near
the celebrated Marble Bar, promises to be the
most dazzling Thespian temple in Australia. The
new house, which will seat 1500, is to have a
spacious promenade after the manner of the
modern London music-hall, and the style of
entertainment to be provided is to be of the
variety brand, with leg-show and living picture
attachments. The decorations for the new temple
are being designed by Phil Goatcher, and will be
carried out under that eminent personage’s
direction. Mr. Clarence Backhouse, who designed
Sydney Lyceum and “modernised” the Sydney
Criterion, is the architect.

Prof. Anderson Stuart’s new patent, self-
adjusting larynx is not regarded with favor in
musical circles. It is said that the possessor of
one of these handy mechanical larynxes can fit
himself out as a basso, a baritone, tenor, contralto
or soprano by merely rigging up his apparatus
with the necessary reed. The prospect of the
whole of the grand opera of the future being sung
by one large, red, perspiring man whose natural
voice is like the bleat of a lost sheep in the wilder-
ness, but who carries a rare assortment of voices
in his vest pocket, and puts his larynx in a tum-
bler when going to bed, is indeed trying to the
trade; but entrepreneurs are bound to be influ-
enced by the large saving in travelling expenses,
and by the knowledge that with such a fit-out there
is no fear of their rival sopranos getting loose in
the dressing-room, and making each other quite
unfit for publication for the love of art. This
invention gives new life to a venerable gag, and
the falsetto voice will probably one day be quite
as common as the false set o’ teeth. This patent
will make an elegant and appropriate birthday
or Christmas present for many public singers The
Bulletin wots of. If Sims Reeves—

“ Gentleman Joe ” hasn’t thrown out any
new shoots at Melb. Princess’s. The story of the
impossible cabman who got .£lO on account for
writing an anti-fat advt. was expected to spread
itself into a bolder show after being watered with
a people’s cheers, but the poor little narrative
made no fresh growth. The god who led the
laughter on the opening night was not engaged to
reappear, and in the absence of that gracious deity
encores waxed fainter, and the curtain began to
fall every evening at 10.20, in spite of the musical
conductor's best efforts to, prolong the agony.
However, the law of compensation applies to a
theatrical season, and “Gentleman Joe’s” inher-
ent weakness will react favorably on the subse-
quent proceedings. “ The Shop Girl” (limited to
one week’s run in May last) comes up for another
week’s revival on Saturday, with the proud con-
sciousness of being rather better in all respects
than the mystery of a hansom cabby. Many
people, having been warned by their friends
against the current attraction, are waiting
patiently for the change of bill, therefore “The
Shop Girl ”is fated to boom. It boasts the special
recommendation of a fat part for Fred Kaye, and
everybody has learned to love little Kaye. He is
a pure comedian, knowing when to be funny with
his face, and when to be wildly comic about the
legs, and never trying to excite more mirth than
the occasion can carry.
** * *
The F east of Horse drawefch nigh to Mel-
bourne, which accounts for a sudden awakening
of show business. On Saturday the estimable
Joseph of Canaan ” will be produced at the
Royal by George Rignold. .This is a much ex-
pected event. Rumors from Sydney have painted
“Joseph’s” spectacular surroundings in glowing
colors, and the Y.M.O.A. is said to be coming in
a holy body to enjoy Mrs. Potiphar’s discomfiture.
Also, the more fleshly patrons of the drama—the
devilled worldlings, so to speak—will seize this
last chance of sampling a first-class actor in a new
character. For although they ought at all times
to assemble and meet together where their old
favorite Rignold is fluttering his banner, yet
ought they most chiefly so to do when he plays a
farewell season at popular prices.. “Joseph of
Canaan ” deserves encouragement, and The Bul-
letin hopes that an unprecedented yield of corn
in Egypt will result.

Fitzgerald Bros.’ new London co. wih
arrive at Melb. Exhibition Building on Saturday.
The Fitz.'s latest enterprise is not a circus, save
as regards Mahomet, the Talking Horse, and he
is more human than most members of society.
Mahomet can tell the time by any watch, and tip
the Caulfield Cup winner with his tail. A few
selected animals, ranging from a low comedian
rooster to an .elephant, are travelling with this
educated steed, but the 00. otherwise consists of
charming women and mighty men, all of whom
do something unusual in a style peculiarly their
own. One lady is an “absolute miracle,” who turns
a double back somersault from the roof, another is
described as the “Swirl Dancer.” Prof. Peart dives
from the domqjnto a tank of water only 6ft. deep,
whilst a brother professor is chucked from a less
height into the same tank after being sewn in a
bag. Every item on the Fitzgerald programme is
a novelty more or less startling. A shilling ticket
admits bearer to the Exhibition, and the season is
limited to nine performances, including a “pair
of matinees.’’,

At Melb. Opera House they broke out in
a new first part on Saturday, likewise the second
part was performed with many variations, and
the whole was received with rapture. Miss Doris
Lester, from Hingland, makes her Australian
ddbut at the Rickards establishment next Satur-
day, when two or three other warblers of ’all
renown will merge themselves into this particular
company for the first time. The Cambridge,
meanwhile, has set up a full change of bill ; and a
burlesque in 11 scenes, entitled “Cinderella,”
deserves credit for its reckless disregard of pre-
cedent, and disposition to strike out a zig-zag
line for itself.
The Late Mr . J. M. TOOHEY.
Mark Twain, who, at time of writing, is
half through his course of ruminative “talks” at
Melbourne Bijou, will have moved along to Ben-
digo when number 816 of this scurrilous rag is let
loose upon the world. Mark Twain in one city
doesn’t seem to present any points of difference
from the same humorist addressing another audi-
ence, and his Sydney success follows him round,
as a matter of course. The term, “ genuine
attraction,” applies to the creator of the “Jump-
ing Frog ” with unusual force. He is just
Mark Twain telling his own yarns with his own
’Murkan accent to admirers of the man and all
his works. Non-admirers signify the same by
stopping away. His personality is everything
that one has been led to expect, which is greatly
to Mark Twain’s credit, inasmuch as some popular
authors are addicted to the venial crime of look-
ing more literary on the frontispiece of their
books than in real life.

The Bulletin feels glad to mention that
George Coppin is no more dead than of yore. A
Melb. evening newspaper lately interviewed the
venerable identity on the occasion of his retire-
ment from the Yic. Leg. Council, and the account
of what he said to the ’Erald’s young man was
ushered into type by sundry alarming headlines,
calculated to make the reader give Mr. Coppin up
for lost. Readers, as a rule, stop short at the
cross-headings—in an evening journal—hence this
timely mention that the curtain has not dropped
on George Coppin, except in a purely political
sense.

Pastor Walters’s Scriptural play, “ Joseph
of Canaan,” which goes up at Melb. Royal on
Oct. 5, comes upon the smellful city at a time
when the heavenly pilots are engaged in a spring
cleaning of their various meeting-houses. The
black-coated brigade are flocking into Melb. from
the country, and the simultaneous assemblage of
Joßeph s brethren at the T.R. at last affords to
the shepherds a reasonable and perfectly proner
excuse for visiting the theatre. The delirious
spectacle of Maud Williamson, with her soulful
eyes, attempting an assault on the guileless George
Kignold s virtue, should be a particularly joyful
experience for the sky-pilots.

Miss Flo. Young’s Katisha is her most consistent effort
up to date. In the Melbourne performance she obligingly
sacrificed her fatal beauty, and made the lady of the
miraculous shoulder-blade quite sufficiently hideous. She
acted and sang the part, too, with such’ spirit that the
second act had quite the vim of other days, when tiny
Alice Barnet gurgled, “Oh, I’m such a silly little goose.”
One thing Flo. would not do—she refused to black out
her pearly teeth, so the tusk that almost stood alone
escaped mention for that occasion only.
Max O’Rell is said to have written a four-act comedy
which will be produced in America next month, as well
as a play for the Daly Co., to burst forth a few months

a probably sick dramatic effort upon possible patrons.

Re-christening an unpopular theatre is the weakest of

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
Ib has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had cne drawback— the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful compl xion of
peach and ivory may he had by anyone who imkefl
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

Prayers for Rain .
People prayed for rain, and they got it; but they
often suppl icate for what they cannot get. They wish
to strike a winner at the races, or thatthenex-tchild
will be a boy, or that they may win a sweep ; and
now that their prayers for rain have been answered,
they will keep on praying for anything else they
desire, and hope they may get it. Smokers have
for a long time been praying for a genuine, full-
flavored, fragrant 6d. cigar ; and this is now on
the market in B. L. Corto Rothschilds. All first-
class tobacconists keep them in stock, and every
judge of the fragrant weed pronounces them Al—
the best value obtainable for the money. Every-
thing comes to those who wait; and for many
years tourists have wondered why the B. L. Corto
Rothschilds was not stocked in the colonies, ft
is only after a great deal of expense that the pre-
sent importers have been enabled to arrange for *
regular supply. Try the B. L. Corto Rothschilds,
and you will be satisfied.*
The Wild-Cat Column .
The Bank of North Queensland has given one
month’s notice of the release of all its reconstructed
deposits. Some of the other banks which died and were
resurrected in ’93 have set free a portion of their locked-
up cash ; the great majority have repaid nothing so tar ;
one has reconstructed a second time, and one has hurst a
second time and gone into liquidation. The B.N.Q. is the
only one of the lot which has released the reconstructed
money in full, and that without any "conversion” pro-
cess or any borrowing in fresh quarters. Asa lot of the
cash will probably be re-deposited at the reduced rates
now current, this proceeding ought to result in a con-
siderable saving in interest.
Melb. tram-shares, which crawled gradually
down to about 7s. 6d., have gone up by another gradual

in the worst days of the depression, large orders came
from England, and John Bull, who mops up everything
sooner or later, bought nearly the whole concern for a
gong. There are very few Vic. holders left now, so the
rise aoesn’t help the province much. A large and com-
rehensive absentee-tax for the discouragement of that
unlimited swallower, J. Bull, is still much wanted in

Building Cos., are calling meetings this month. Both
recently agreed to pay 5 per cent, interest on their
deposits, but they find the burden too vast to stagger
under* and intend asking a reduction—probably to 3 per

The Freehold Investment and Banking Cos.
fMelb.) has carried through the most remarkable recon-
struction scheme of the century. The alleged business
and all the immense mass of unsaleable property are to be
handed over to the Freehold Assets Realisation co., which
is to issue to the creditors 5 per cent, deposit-receipts in
navment of their claims. The receipts are payable when
the co. feels equal to the work, which may be 10 or 100
vears henoe or more. The interest is to be paid in deposit
receipts also, and these are likewise to be redeemed when
the co. feels equals to the work. If the co. never feels
equal to the work it may go on accumulating deposit-
receipts for ever. It is a beautifully simple and restful
device, and the co. can now lie low and wait for the next
boom, ’whenever that may be.

The Bank of Australasia cables a few particu-
lars of another depressing balance-sheet—one that is
even more depressing than the last. The net profit for
the half-year is £40,854 against £45,734 last half-year,
£4B 570 for the half ended April, '94, and £60,606 for the
one’ended October,’93. A 5 per cent. div. swallows
£4O 000, so there is only £854 to carry forward. The
Australasia’s div. has been falling away from the old,
gorgeous 14 per cent, for a good many years past, and the
present div. represents still another drop. Deposits and
advances, which have been decreasing with more or less
regularity for five years or so, have again diminished
slightly. The present rate of profit represents about
£3 Bs. per cent, per annum on the shareholders’ capital
and reserve-fund, so apparently the profits of the ordinary
banking business-despite the fact that it is a very large
one-are exceedingly limited.

The quarter’s revenue in N.S.W. is £IOB,OOO
more than for the corresponding quarter of ’94. In Vic-
toria there is a similar increase of £15,000, and in South
Australia of £14,000. This unanimity among the three
provinces looks almost like a general revival, it such a
thing be really possible.
* * * •
The conversion of the N.S.W, 5 per cent. loans,
which fall due next year, into a 3J per cent, liability will
save £14,661 annually in interest. In England a fixed
sum is set aside each year to meet the charges on the
public debt, and when the interest is reduced by a con-
version the amount thus saved goes to swell the sinking-
fund and make the process of extinction go on all the
faster. Thev are not built that way, however, in N.S.W.
There never was a N.S.W. Government yet which could
be trusted with a sinking fund any more than a mongrel
could be trusted alone with a beef steak.

Victoria is much troubled because its railway
revenue doesn’t cover working expenses and interest on
cost, and is making extraordinary efforts to extinguish
the annual deficiency of £380,000. And yet, so far as
concerns its public works department, that province is a
lot better off than any of its neighbors. In Victoria the
net revenue derived from works that have been built with
borrowed money covers the interest all but £546,000. In
N.S. Wales the deficit to be provided out of revenue is
£592,000 ; in Queensland it amounts to £642,000. The
other provinces represent varying degrees of financial
disaster, Tasmania being, in proportion to its liabilities,
the worst of all. The N.S.W. railways yield the best per-
centage of profit in Australasia, but the loan-account is
weighed down by the interest on vast sums spent on
roads, bridges, dredging, and other jobs that yield no
revenue whatever, and the new forest-thinning industry
will further aggravate the evil.

A lot of good might be done by »a banking law
providing that all property which comes into the hands
of a bank by foreclosure shall be disposed of inside of
two years. It would prevent' the accumulation of pro-
perty in the bank’s hands. It would consequently pre-
vent all the banks becoming gorged with land at the
same time, and the consequent simultaneous rush to
realise, and the forcing down of values through half the
earth being offered for sale at once. It would make
the banks clear up their losses as they went along instead
of spending 10 boom years in accumulating foreclosed
land and putting it in the balance-sheet at book-values,
and then 10 busted years in making awful revelations
and gathering up the ruins and reconstructing. In
short, it would compel the ostrich to take his head out of

Instead of keeping it buried for an indefinite period as at

Maoriland is exporting timber at the average
rate of about £150,000 worth per an., and the total value
of the timber cut down in the fast decaying forests of ttie
province is about £1,000,000 yearly. There are but
20,000,000 acres of forest-land now remaining, and the
only attempt made to repair the devastation consists of
the establishment of about a million acres of State
reserves. Unless vigorous steps are taken in the direc-'

the money can help him to fill it m, and if, between them,
they don’t succeed in making the document valid, that is

legal expenses is a good feature in Maoriland legislation.

In addition to treating about 480 tons of sulp-
hides weekly at its own concentrating mill, Junction
(8.H.) has just contracted to supply Dry Creek works
with 2000 tons, at the rate of 500 tons a week. The
Junction mill is doing good work, and the mine has
developed well lately. Joel Phillips, the present manager,
a peculiarly-unpretentious man, has served this 00.
admirably.
Half-yearly report of the B.H. South, for the
terra to June 30, is issued only at the end of Sept. It is
good enough, however. “ The net gain to the co. for
the period under review amounts to £11,738 13s. 7d., and
it will be observed that there is a credit of £4219 16s. od.
in lieu of a debit of £7518 16s. lOd. to profit and
loss account, as in the last statement submitted.
This report of the South is peculiarly valuable. It
is the first issued by any B.H. co. working sulphides
only during the whole half-year. To get this net profit
of £II,OOO odd, 28,775 tons of ore were treated, pro-
ducing 9867 tons concentrates ; hut only 8699 tons of the
latter were shipped ; the balance remained on the mine.
But most of this balance has been drawn against. The
mining and treating, from breaking the ore in the face
until it is bagged and loaded ready for dispatch, cost
14s. 4Jd. per ton of ore.
Since the beginning of July there has been a
considerable, and apparently permanent, rise in the price
of lead ; moreover, many improvements have been made
in the jigging appliances. In these circumstances the
South’s profit per ton of ore should keep for some time at
very little under 10s.—amounting to a trifle under £6OO a
week.
From July 1 to Sept. 21 the quantity of concen-
trates dispatched from the South mine was 5500 tons.
A parcel of concentrates from the B.H. North
has been passing through the B.H. South concentrating
mill. It proves good milling stuff; an extraction of over
65 per cent, lead has been made.
During the four weeks ended Sept. 21 the out-
put of the Broken Hill mines was 55,182 tons ore—the
highest on record. Of this, 23,246 came from mines
other than the Proprietary. The value of the extractable
silver and lead (a very different thing, of course, from the
gross value) was about £171,000.
The Howell (Illawarra Oo.) people talk of being
able to give 30s. per ton at the mine for such sulphides as
Block 10 produces. If the South can mine and concen-
trate for 14s. 4ld. per ton, there is clearly a big profit
ahead for Block 10, whose ore the co. appears to
desire most. Of course the Ten Co.’s ore is much richer
in silver—averages, perhaps, 220 z. to 250 z., as against 7oz.
or Boz. This consideration accounts for the recent sub-
stantial rise in Block 10’s—a rise which is not, however,
altogether approved at the Hill.
The Ashcroft sulphide process hangs fire in
England. “ Show us a big lot,” they say; and so a big
lotls going across the water—several hundred tons.
David Lindsay does nob, after all, join the
Howell Westralian Exploration Cos.
Melb. Age, in its article commemorative of the
B H. Proprietary’s 100th div., started on its rounds-the
statement that the mine’s largest yield since the com-
mencement of operations “was that for the week ending
July 4, 1894, which consisted of silver 675,9130 z., lead
1820 tons, copper 595 tons.” More rubbish ! There had
been the usual half-yearly clean-up, &0., which swelled the
figures. Asa matter of fact, the silver produced in that
week was 216,0300 z., which was the least for the whole
half-year. Copper 595 tons 1 Why, the mine has never
produced that imioh in any whole half-year.
The B.H. Proprietary with its Sept, div.—the
100th—declared a Is. bonus, thus distributing altogether
£96,000 (more, by the way, than the whole of the August
gold-export from Westralia was worth). The bonus was
paid because “the fire was not so serious a matter as had
been thought.” Just about six weeks ago we were first
told that there was, in the opinion of the general ma'nager,
no fire left in the mine. Since then, when smoke
has appeared, it has been explained that “ the carbonic
acid gas was forcing out pent -up bodies of
smoke.” These and other similar explanations
have been quite \yorn out, however. If there was
ever fire in the mine it was in the last weeks of Sept.
The odor of burning pine was more noticeable then than
it ever was before ; in tact, it had hardly before that been
discernible in the towm. There appears to be fire in two
distinct places ; the subsidence in the big quarry has pro-
bably smothered the middle of it, leaving the two ends
burning. The smoke is being now led upward, and thus,
the workings being kept comparatively clean, men are
cautiously bulk-heading up towards the affected parts—a
work which is not without its danger.
Possible that the calling of tenders by B.H.
Proprietary Cos. for the raising of limestone from leases
which it has acquired may be taken too seriously. But

The latest surprising aspect of the Dean
case is that Attorney-General Want says that
Salomons told him that Meagher told him that
Dean told him that he (Dean) was really guilty.
Salomons, apparently, acknowledges that he told
this to Want, but Meagher says that he
didn’t tell anything of the kind to Salomons,
and Dean says most positively that he didn’t
tell it to Meagher. Crick backs up the
Meagher - Dean aspect of the story, but, as he
can only say that he didn’t hear Meagher tell
Salomons or Dean tell Meagher, his statements
have no direct bearing on the ease. Also, Dean
runs the Mosman’s Bay steamer as usual.

In all the real, or artificial, sinuosities of
the resurrected Dean case, it must not be forgotten
that the questions and answers—the problem and
its solution—on which the whole case hinged were
purely medical ones, and that the medical mem-
bers of the Commission pronounced such doubts
of accused’s guilt as to secure his release. It
must nob be forgotten that there was found in the
dejecta enough poison to have killed all the wives
of the late Brigham Young—so much poison, at
any rate, that, had it passed through Mrs. Dean’s
system, as contended by the prosecution, she
could no more have been alive than if she had
been filled up to the neck with kerosene and set
on fire.

The apparently-irrelevant and generally-
anintelligible impeachment of the times for deli-

closures ” of the other day.

A SIGN OF THE TIMES.—Sketched in a Sydney book-shop.
It, as staked, Salomons, Q. 0., Attorney-
General Want, and Chief Justice Darley, were
the only persons who knew of Dean’s alleged con-
fession, and did not breathe a word of it to any-
body, how did the “rumor” come to the ears of
Kater, M.L.C., with the result that this lamb-
like politician asked a question in the House ?
Assuming, for argument’s sake, the entire truth
of Mr. Salomons’s statement and Mr. Want’s, it
must follow that Mr. Meagher has been telling a
similar story in other quarters.

The Dean-stricken barristers who have
been constructing theoretical analogies these last
few days between priests and lawyers in the
matter of the inviolability of secrets con-
fided by clients, lose their labour for the
following among a host of reasons: A peni-
tent confessing to a priest considers himself
really confessing to God. The priest is but a
medium, just as a telephone might be. The secret
communicated is, therefore, not the priest’s, but
God’s. That is the idea which rules the case. On
the other hand, when a client gives a secret to a
solicitor, it is the Devil’s —that is to say, the
solicitor’s. The client begins with him, ends with
him, and looks no further. Again, a penitent
confesses to a priest to procure pardon for some-
thing done; a client consults a solicitor not to
obtain pardon for an offence committed, but to
enlist power to prove he didn’t commit it at all.
Professions so radically distinct don’t admit of
analogical treatment.

Pastor Torrance made the Melb. Anglican
Synod laugh, the other day, by a proposal to club
incomes, and ladle out proportionally, as a solu-
tion of the difficulty of the poor bush parson. All
this is a mere glimmer of what they talk about
outside —the downright burlesquery of giving
childless Bishop Goe and wife £4O a week, with a
free house (on top of their large private income),
and then starting his reverence whining for
driblets in aid of the wretched, hard-working
Anglican preachers, one of whom, the Assembly
was informed by Mr. Torrance, has to keep self,
family, and two horses, on 30s. a week, while
another (with three horses, and a little over £2 a
week) provides for the teeming family which ever
blesses the really hardworking and starved parson.

The visiting justices at Melb. Gaol have
given Emanuel Abrahams an extra six months for
malingering. At latest dates, Louis, the last of
the “ partially paralysed ” brethren, was being
carefully fed with a view to getting him fit for the

game. A gloomy look-out for Louis—

“We’d be quite
happy if mother wasn’t
always hugging father, ”
was the evidence given
recently by a saturnine
small boy in a Welling-
ton (M.L.) mainten-
anoe-case. “ Mother
was always hugging
and kissing father,”
added the small boy in
further explanation,
“and father couldn’t
stand it.” Whereupon
the magistrate decided
that it was quite use-

deep-rooted objection
to being called “ducky”

A lately-deceased
Melb. policeman used
to tell his cronies this
story: “ Onedark night
I was on the Bridge
(Princes) when I heard
a cry for help. I rushed
down to Edwards’ boat-
shed, and there saw a
woman hanging on to
one of his boats. She
had, no doubt, jumped
in, but found the water
too cold. In trying to
pull her out I fell over-
board myself. She
grabbed meandfainted,
but hung on hard. I
grabbed the boat and
hung on for bare life,
for I was wearing my
heavy top coat. We
were rescued, and for
weeks afterwards I was the hero of the hour.
Everyone, from the Governor down, slobbered
over me, but I kept my mouth shut. I couldn’t
swim a stroke.”

“Whilst the leaders of society take their
wives and daughters to gaze at half-naked women
on the stage, how can we consistently object to
these girls in our hotels?” asks Or. Moloney,
Melb., in defence of the barmaid. But the apostle
of snuffle who objects to the barmaid also objects
to the shapely girl in the tableaux, and the leggy
damsel in the ballet—to woman in all shapes, in
fact, barring the grisly shape of the bony horror
that accompanies him in his “ crusade.” He does
not object on his own account—not at all, he
rather likes them plump and young out of his
business hour—but because they are a lure to the
other man. “Lead us not into temptation”
means to the professional male purist—“ Lead not
the other fellow.”

The threatened abolition of barmaids from
Melbourne’s social system has elicited a testi-

me to make an effort for the recovery of my self-
respect. . . I did so, and although I still have

Smellbourne’s new' evening paper, the

“ When our representative visited the scene this

had happened in the vicinity—the trams ran the
same, the dead slumbered as peacefully in the old
cemetery, and the street-hawkers vended their
wares with the unaltered stereotyped cries.” In

He used to be an unreflecting boozer
Till Tottie whispered softly in his ear:
“O, why are you a scandalous abuser
Of an excellent capacity for beer?
Your nose is getting red and rather bloated,
It grieves me to behold you going wrong.”
Then an alcoholic maxim Tottie quoted —
“ ‘The drinker of a little drinketh long.’ ”
“ Booze in moderation, ducky : don’t be always tight:
Swill a fair potation, ducky, twice or thrice a night.”
His manhood he asserted when she kissed him on the
brow :
The johnnie was converted, and he’s doing nicely now.
Instead of dissipating all his wages,
And running up a score upon the slate,
He began to mend his ways by eaav stages,
His manner grew impressively sedate,
His boko's pure and spolless as a lily,
The surface isn’t scrofulously rough :
And sometimes Tottie pouts, “ You sober silly,
I didn’t mean you not to take enough !”
“ Booze in moderation, ducky: don’t get beastly drunk.”
She winks a timely warning, and he toddles when she’s
wnnk:
There’s a way where’er the will is, and the boozer’s
guiding star
Is the eye of Tottie Phyllis, beaming brightly at the bar.

The Sydney daily papers have been
pathetically paragraphing how a newly-appointed
“sheriff’s officer,” at one N.S.W. bush town,
“ wished God-speed” to his promoted predecessor,
and spoke, too, “on behalf of the profession.
The ballad-immortalised Sam Hall is made to
imprecate :
“ The sheriff, he’ll come, too,
With all his bloody crew,
Their dirty work to do.”
Yet, whereas Sam Hall was prejudiced against
sheriffs and their myrmidons, the press of Sydney
recognises “ the profession.” But the awful joite
of wishing a bailiff “ God-speed ” shows with what
coarse freedom a superficially pious community is
willing and eager to handle the name of the
Almighty.

economy in the labour necessary to bring products
to perfection, but economy in its broadest, fullest
sense—the application of prudent and scientific
management to natural production, and the de-
thronement of the “ruleof thumb ” system. The
present standard average value of a well-classed
and skirted Victorian wool, merino or crossbred,
may be taken at 7gd per pound, while the irregu-
lar, badly classed and skirted wools will only
bring from 20 to 25 per cent. less. The difference
in these prices is in many instances the result of
the difference in wool-growers. The careful man
who spares no pains in bringing his product to
the highest point of perfection secures the highest
market price; the careless, indifferent man has to
take the lowest. The hint here thrown out by
the National Wool Company should command the
notice of sheepfarmers.
When the lawyer is led into errors
And discovered, he feels little awe,
For the gaol does not hold forth its terrors
To the criminal man of the law.
Lo, tlie spirit of Satan, their father,
In the mongers of “Justice” is shown —
A propensity strong to be rather
Too good to their own.
So they pray (shall we say at Megtddo ?)
That the God (that His kingdom may come ?)
Of the fatherless and of the widow
Shall especially prosper the “ bum ! ”
Shall forsake His own weaklings of clients.
At a “bum’s” mere sophistical caw,
To “ sool on ” all the dogs of the giants
Of Riches, Extortion and Law.
Though it seems to the masses a moan,
Though it brings desolation indeed,
It’s a neat little thing of our own >f
Thus to wish a bum-bailiff “ God-speed !
When we levy, the “bum ” is a Caliph,
And the fools will believe at our nod.
We’ll persuade ’em that God is the bailiff.
And, by converse, the bailiff is Gcd.

cooling or refreshing than a little Amykos
sprinkled in the water in which you lave your

using it all day long, but those who have experi-
enced its benefits say that the morning ablutions
are certainly not complete without it. Purchase
a sample bottle from your chemist.*

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
October 1,1895.
Mr Dear Moorabinda—
Possibly with an eye to counteracting the sinful
effects of the Spring race-meeting, the W.C.T.U.
and its cub, the Y.W.0.A., gave a show in the
race-week, and the air in certain parts of the city
was thick with angular females trimmed like first
and third prize calves, with blue or white rosettes,
and absolutely bristling with literature en suite .
The W.C.T.U. hen-parties are not wholly un-
entertaining. I believe their social-evil evenings
—when all aspects of “evil ” are elaborately gone
into—are solemnly, but unmistakeably cerulean—
and serious blueness sinks in much deeper than
the airier sorts. The “ Y’s ” don’t actively par-
ticipate in these badly-told smoke-room stories, as
you might call them —the Y’s are probationers
who are given all the dry subjects to work up, and
one of them rose despairingly at a recent conven-
tionfand read a paper asking, “ How can we make
our meetings a source of pleasure as well as
profit ? ” The only way I can suggest would be to
“ do ” the Magdalen retreats, and so forth, a day
ahead of the allegedly Christian women, and
spring their funny stories on ’em unaware.
The W.C.T.U. is a dreary and despairing aggre-
gate, with a profound private opinion that it can
buckle the universe to a water-bottle if it really
makes up its mind to do it—but it really attempts
miracles when it ventures outside its own circle of
joyless, brow-beaten infants and hen-pecked hus-
bands. At the Convention, one lady rose to ask,
in a scandalised voice ; “Is there any rule bearing
upon individual members of our union attending
a dance ? ” and the corners of her mouth expressed
the opinion that if there wasn’t there ought to be.
From this, it would appear that when the
W.C.T.U. prevails there is to be no more dancing.
They might as well go a step further, and table a
motion, signed by several Sunday-schools, to
abolish original sin. Think of the stupendousness
of their contract —the abolition of champagne and
the “ Blue*Danube ! ”
Providence, by the way, does not appear to be
very enthusiastically on the side of the Cold Tea
Brigade. One of the first places to run out of
water during the late drought was the Echo Farm
for Inebriates —the denizens whereof had to go
more miles after water than they ever went in all
their lives after whisky. The idea of an inebriate
being expected to turn out full of enthusiasm, with
a bucket each side, in order to fetch his own
draught from the crystal spring an hour’s walk
distant is altogether too new. The Temperance
Farm must have a wonderfully reforming effect.
The success of Juliet Wray in “ Madame Angot ”
(put up for two nights, at Sydney Lyceum, last
week) was another instance of the triumph of mind
over matter. Juliet certainly isn’t up to much as
a pretty picture. Her limbs are Brown-Potterish
—she keeps that far-reaching split in Clairette’s
wedding-garment discreetly caught together in
consequence (attenuated understandings are
mostly responsible for what there is of feminine
modesty observable on the stage); her hands are
not microscopic, and her feet aren’t as pretty as
Palotta’s; also, her voice is shrill and gritty in
several places, and her wig too big for her face,
especially when her hat was off. But, despite all
these pictorial disadvantages, Miss
Clairette was quite electrifying, and she must have
an astonishing amount of pluck as well as impish
cleverness to succeed so thoroughly in a part
which Nellie Stewart has made her own. She has
several marked mannerisms, but experience will
cure all that—though the quicker she learns not
to knit her brows as if her high notes hurt her the
more effective she will be. The awful fixed grin
of the seasoned soprano may be a ghostly thing at
heart, but it looks more festive than a troubled
expression suggesting that something’s gone
wrong with the works. On the second night of
“ Madame Angot ” something did go wrong and
Miss Wray, I regret to hear, fainted after the fall
of the curtain.
The new first tenor taking Tapley’s place with
the Comic Opera Cos. —Mr. Courtice Pounds—is a
favorite with the matinde girl, mostly on account
of Tiis sweet smile, which is said to be a particu-
larly fine effort. And his legs must be all right,
too, for he is addicted to biking and is a rowing-
man as well—he and Wallace Brownlow were at
one time fellow-members of the London Rowing
Club. By repute he has a charming light tenor
voice, is a clever actor, and dances well ; but the
most wonderful aspect of Mr. P. is that he is that
rare bird, a prodigy grown to man’s estate and re-
taining a reasonable amount of genius. Mr.
Pounds was a boy-soprano (church soprano) in his
thoughtless youth, but has since made every effort,
I believe, to retrieve such a horrible past.
The maiden show of the newly-formed Society
of Artists, held at York-street skating-rink, was
sartorially remarkable for the oneness of the
artists on the mouch-about-hat question. From
the chairman to the least considerable painter of
them all everybody was roofed-in softly. Generally
speaking, I liked the pictures, including a great
many women and horse studies, which looks as if
Australian artists were addicted to sentiment and
sport. The trail of “Trilby” was over the women-
pictures, which, after all, are painted for men—
Arthur Streeton’s “Lotus Eater,” for example.
The drapery of silvery gauze was all the women
cared to look at, wishing they had it for a theatre
blouse; as for the pink girl herself on her marble
slab, with her alluring expression somewhat re-
miniscent of PouzoTs “ Femme qui rit,” I’m not
sure she wasn’t femininely designated a “hussy.”
I think the women liked the girl in “ Herrick’s
Blossoms ” best because she was so like a boned
turkey, and the best way for a woman to please a
woman is to look just like that.
There is no bone of contention on the walls this
year for people to haggle over like Sid. Long’s
impressionist bathing-scene of last spring. Among
the many flower-studies Mias Ethel Stephens’s
white roses panel caught my eye at once, and my
favorite animal picture was Mahony’s “ The Cry
of the Mothers ” —mares and foals with a cow and
calf, all, save the one dead foal, instinct with
terror, waiting the oncoming of a flood. The newly-
formed Society of Artists may look with compla-
cency on its maiden outing. Nothing less like
a debut and more like an old-established institu-
tion could well be imagined, from the string-band
at the top of the gallery to the waratahs at the
entrance. The hanging committee only made one
false step, and that was in hanging the Presby-
terian Moderator, puir mon ! quite next door to
the Lotus Eater. The rigid Kirk would surely
object to having one of its shepherds even pic-
torially in such a lightly-clad connection.
Mark Twain has gone to Melbourne after a brief
but successful Sydney season. He had rather a
cruel time of it here at the hands of the autograph-
hunters, and the fiends with confession-books, and
the pitiless possessors of albums who expect genius
to sparkle gaily gratis in order to gratify the
owner’s craving for that sort of thing. And poor
Mark sparkled duly. One of the pearls of wisdom
he left behind him was written in the album of a
Sydney musician. Wrote Mark —who was here
during the fever of the Spring meeting—“lt were
not best that all men should agree. If there were
no differences of opinion there would be no horse-
racing.” Neatly put.
The season of big charity balls will probably
come to an end with the dance at Sydney Town
Hall on 14th inst. in aid of the Bienfaisance
Fran§ais. The tickets are ss. each, and a huge
attendance is inevitable at the price, considering
that all the regulation dais deities have also pro-
mised to attend. Lady Innes is president, and
Mesdames Tauveron and M. O’Brien divide the
onerous duties of hon. secs, to what I hope will be
a most successful ball.
Her many friends will be glad to hear that Miss
Maude Roberts —one of Sydney’s prettiest girls—
who met with a very bad riding accident the other
day, is now out of all danger and nearly con-
valescent. It is a good thing that, although she
was dragged a quarter-of-a-mile, Miss Roberts
did not sustain any facial injury whatever.
Australians who meditate a trip to London will
be glad to hear that Mr. Frank Blackley, once a
well-known Sydney stockbroker, has resumed the
management of the Inns of Court Hotel, Lincoln’s
Inn Fields. Mr. Blackley writes to say that his
aim will be to make the house “a rallying spot
for his Australian friends,” and he has the smiling
countenance of ex-Govs. Jersey, Hopetoun,andPre-
datoros Robinson, who have all written the most
suitable-for-advertising remarks that the heart of
an hotel-manager could desire. Though they do
say that generally the last thing an Australian
abroad longs to meet is another Australian.
Talking of London, Miss Elsa May, the Aus-
tralian warbler, has fallen on her feet in the Big
Smoke apparently having signed a twelve
months engagement as prima donna with W. J.
Turner’s opera co. touring throughout England.
A press-notice describes her as “a grand vocalist
and an acquisition to the co.” In a private letter
received from Camilla Urso, also in London at
time of writing, the gifted violinist expressed her
intention of shortly paying another visit to Aus-
tralia, where the audiences suit her to a T. She
will come vi& South Africa, whither she went on
leaving Melbourne last year. She did not play in
London, where there was “much, too much,
music,” and cold audiences in consequence.
Madame is at present in New York.
I have received from W. H. Paling and Cos. a
copy of Paling’s dance-annual. The cover is a gay
affair, something like the second act of the “ Shop
Girl,” and the contents are equally up to date.
The “ Gaiety” lancers, introducing the latest airs,
are the best point in the annual, which contains
fifteen easy items of an eminently danceable
nature.
From Riooordi and Sons, London, come several
songs of a highly-wrought nature. “ Ask Me
Not,” words by Binnie, and music by G. A. Sala,
begs the beloved object to “Blast me not like a
withered tree,” which sounds as if the darling was
in the habit of using cuss-words, while G.A.S.’s
music to these wild pleadings is about up to a
Xmas-supplement song for the ghost of Sala’s
deadjournal. “Love is Lief,” by Tito Mattei,
is another string of incoherent eroticisms
set to rather obscure music. “Heart to
Heart, E. Bonetti (no thin warbler would
ever sing the music of a man with a name
like that), is also warm off the hob of passion, but
with some melody in the music; and a serenade,
“Dream thou of me,” by Colson Taylor, has the
fevered sentiment decently reined in, and the
music goes smoothly. Two pieces for violin and
piano, “Andante Melancolique,” by Simonetti,
and a Berceuse by William Henley, finish the
“ Riccordi.”
Apropos of music, they were agitating in Syd-
ney recently for band performances on Sunday
afternoon in the Domain, but Major-General
Hutton (an adept at “lending” military bands
for charitable purposes—balls, and so on—gratis,
much to the chagrin of the public bands which
pom-pom dance-music for a living) vetoed the
idea in a way that looked as if the M.G. had
shares in the big drum of the Salvation Army
which has the middle of the road to itself on Sun-
days. He “could not recommend that the band
should devote their Sunday to providing a musical
boon for the population of Sydney,” and “ it was
undesirable on all grounds that soldiers should be
called upon to infringe upon their Sunday for any
duty that could be avoided.”
Certainly, while the band has so many privat®
engagements at which to blow its soul out fo r
mere “ rations ” —a ham-sandwich or so at half-
time—it might very well keep its wind to
itself on Sundays. But, perhaps, if the artistic
Major-General wasn’t quite so prodigally lavish
with military music on society occasions, these
nicely-trimmed dispensers of exhilarating melodies
would have a little time to give to entertaining
their staunch admirers, the general public. For
Sydney is a place directly in need of plenty of
band-music —which the women should go to listen
to in white gowns with red umbrellas.
A brand-new way to recover old debts was hit
upon the other day by a Queensland matron who
had lent a goodish sum of money to a church.
Naturally enough, the management of the sacred
pile made no sort of effort to repay the filthy
lucre, and as the time fixed upon for paying the
debt went past unnoticed, the lady determined to
take matters into her own hands. First, she had
a long and mysterious interview with her sainted
debtors—and what then transpired will never be
known ; but the upshot was that she shortly after-
wards engineered a grand fancy bazaar “in aid of
the church.” And when the thing had been
brought to a successful-issue Madame pocketed
the proceeds herself, apd got her money back in
that way.
I have received from David Jones and Cos. a
copy of their manual of Spring and Summer
fashions, which suggest the Rand wick lawn on
Derby Day seen in a vision—all except the even-
ing dresses, of course, which, by the way, are not
so screamingly decollete as of yore, thank good-
ness. If they catch on, a modest man may hope
to spend an evening at the theatre on a fashion-
able night without blushing. When you come to
think how sylphlike women are in general, the
moderate scoop observable in D. Jones and Co.’s
summer evening gowns should have a warm wel-
come from the raw-bone brigade. J. L. Hordern
and Cos., Pitt-street, are also disseminating an
attractive fashion-plate, which exhibits larger
sleeves and wider skirts than are obtainable any-
where else.
Drapery reminds me, in a way, that a little
Victorian mining township was recently greatly
exercised in the upper-circles over the momentous
question, “Shall tradesmen’s daughters be ad-
mitted to our dances?” After long and serious
argument, a compromise was effected on the basis
that only drapers’ daughters should be tolerated —
a conclusion very easily arrived at, I should think,
considering how an Australian d’s and. is going to
marry an aide-de-camp, and how another d’s and.
is the pet of at least two Gov’mentouses. But, all
the same, this unanimity on the subject of drapery
belles looks awfully as if the elite of that
mining township hadn’t all cashed up for their
Spring bonnets.
The appointment of Colonel Gerard Smith—a
cousin of ex-Gov. Oarington— to the Governor-
ship of Westralia, doesn’t seem to give anybody
special pleasure, and will probably not afford the
colonel much unalloyed joy, either, though he will
have golden opportunities for practising the
family yawn. Perth is not a popular appoint-
ment; and the moral certainty that her Ex.
will bolt after six months makes Westralian
society take bub a listless interest in the gyrations
of a personage whom the Fates have decided
shall be but a fleeting show. On dit that one-half
the reason why Westralian Governors’ wives flee
the place, at short notice, is that society is so
inured to being run by a grass-widower that it
hangs round the Gov. from sheer force of habit,
and pays the lady most perfunctory attention.
Talking of Governors—where is our blase Hamp-
den all this time ? If he doesn’t come soon the
A. Y.R.’s will be getting unpopular—the Acting-
Governoress’s amiability nob being always dis-
creetly displayed. At the opening of a bazaar the
other day, for instance, a little Chinese girl
handed Her Acting Ex. some flowers, whereupon
she kissed the small Celestial! Vice-regality
kissing a Chow in-embryo 1 lb was the greatest
blunder a potentatess could commit in Australia—
next to employing a Chinese cook 1
lb is announced in London that the attractive
Miss Alice Fouoart, late of Sydney, is shortly to
be wedded to Mr. H. Percy Pulleine, of the 24th
Regt. (South Wales Borderers). And those “in
the know ” say that the old doctor will follow
suit on his own account.
Considering the number of daily divorces, would
it nob be well for the morning papers to intro-
duce the fashion of recording these in the same
column as the marriage advertisements, in order
that those going for the Matrimonial Stakes may
be provided with “ form at a glance ? ”
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ Entire devotion to the sailor-hat is feminine
Melbourne’s chief sin sartorially. This shape of
hat, which is only becoming to young fresh faces,
is worn by women of all ages and on all occasions,
and an otherwise smart costume is often entirely
spoilt by it. I beheld no less than three at a
toney wedding last week : one topped a Parisian
confection of glad silk and lace ; another crowned
a face, fair and forty at least, garnished with
long horse-teeth—the face, nob the hat, I
mean ; the other really was suitable to a
pretty, flushed-looking seventeen-year maiden
in pink muslin. But to see the S.H. in
all its glory one should go to a Salon afternoon
tea. When viewed from the door the room has
the appearance of a field of small mushrooms,
black and white by reason of the omnipresent
* sailor.’
“ One of Melb.’s prettiest brunettes, Miss Mary
Aitken, daughter of Mr. W. Aitken (who, by the
way, has just built some huge roller flour-mills in
Sydney),t was married last week to Mr. J. Hall.
Miss Aitken, in ivory bengaline, with ‘lashins ’of
exquisite lace and orange flowers, made a dainty
bride indeed, and her two bridesmaids were in
strict contrast to her, both girls being tall and
fair. Mr. Aitken ia celebrated for poaasssing the
most valuable collection of old raaatera in Melb.
The Claude Lorraines and Salvator Rosas are
gloomy enough to convince anyone of their
genuineness.
“There was a great crush to get into Max
Hambourg’a concert on Thursday afternoon, and
some frantic scenes took place. One lady had her
skirt literally torn off her back. On entering the
hall the strugglers found that their pushing was
quite unnecessary, as the place was but moderately
filled after all.
“ The last of the Madden series of balls at Vic.
Govt. House had a sorb of finale air about it.
There was a quickening of the pace about things
generally—a number of convivial spirits putting a
lot of wind-up thoroughness into the programme.
The rush of debutantes was a marked feature of
the closing night. They were all excessively
bride-like and festive in appearance, as though to
say they’d gob there before the now every day
more imminent Lady Brassey had a chance of
looking possible disfavor from the steps of the
blue dais. With the exception of that picture-
piece, the fancy-dress affair, this last was the most
brilliant of the whole set under acting-vice-regal
management. Next morning the vice-royalties
trooped back to their own domicile, and the flag
was hauled down from the battlement, nob to be
again unfurled until the Brasseys make their
triumphal entry.
“ An empty room over an unused shop-front in
Fitzroy-streeb, St. Kilda, has been let to a loyal
family for two guineas, for the privilege of over-
looking the arriving Brasseys as they go past.
Quite a windfall for the shop-owner, who probably
hasn’t had as much in rent for the past 12 months.
“ At the Cape, the Brasseys found a whole arm-
ful of letters asking them to be presidents, patrons,
or openers of pretty nearly half the shows extant
in Victoria. When they get to Adelaide they
will find a cartload more.
A maiden writing from Adelaide : “We all
looked forward with much eagerness to the glories
of Mrs. Brough’s new gowns fresh from London
and Paris. We were doomed to disappointment,
however, for, with one or two trifling exceptions,
she wore the dresses we admired and discussed
when she played the same parts in Melb. and
Sydney. By the way, pretty Grace Noble has
had all her sunny brown hair cut off, so that, as
Lord Willy, she really looks like a saucy little
boy.”
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
People from such remote suburbs as
Bourke, Wiloannia or Broken Hill, who may
happen to be detained in Sydney overnight, will
find it to their advantage to stay at one of Ellis’s
Coffee Palaces—at Nos. 46 to 52 King-st., and The
Crescent, 631 George-st. City folks are also in-
vited to remember that the King-st. dining-saloon

The friends of one William John George
Carvell are advertising for information as
to his whereabouts. Carvell left Warwickshire,
England, for Queensland, about 15 years ago. He
is supposed to have once kept the North Queens-
land Hotel, George-street, Sydney, and to have
been interested in some North Queensland gold-
mines. Anyone with news of the missing man is
referred to the advertisement in this issue.*
Visitors to the Spouting Spring at Heli-
don, 70 miles from Brisbane, are always astounded
at the quantity of water they can consume at the
Spring. Ten or 12 tumblers in an hour or so are
taken with comfort. The reason is that the
tissues of the body are absorbing the water all the
time. Something beneficial is always added to
the system by every glass of Helidon Spa water
consumed. Messrs. Tooth and Co., Kent
Brewery, are the Sydney agents.*
Henry Lawson’s book, which may be
called “Block and Backblooks : Australian Verses

be out shortly and will, like “Banjo’s” (orders
for which are rapidly flowing in), be a handsome
volume printed in new type on fine paper. The
price will be ss, 6d., post free from this office, and
The Bulletin, after seeing the material of which
the book is composed, has no hesitation in saying
that it deserves to be, and will be, an immediate
and permanent success.
Same Story Everywhere.
In Sydney, as in every other town and city in
the world, when Warner’s Safe Cure was first
introduced people shook their heads and would
hardly believe when they heard of the cures from
long-standing biliousness, jaundice, indigestion,
or kidney disease effected through its use. Now
the army of believers is daily increasing, and you
can hardly turn without meeting one who owes
life and health to the virtue of this remedy. Do
we believe them? How can we help doing so?
Here they are, and thousands of letters like the
following are enough to make the strongest sceptic
hesitate before crying down something he has not
tried. Read this letter from Miss Maude Whyte,
Forest Lodge, Sydney. Do you think for one
moment that this conscientious lady would mis-
represent facts so important to the general public?
Then weigh carefully her experience and let it
guide you. She writes ; “In some things it takes
a deal of persuasion, and even demonstration, to
secure my faith, and one of these was Warner’s
Safe Cure. T had heard about it from friends and
acquaintances quite a number of times, but could
never be induced to try it, supposing it to be what
is commonly called a ‘quack medicine,’ until,
when exceedingly ill from an attack due to in-
activity of the liver, a lady friend put a bottle into
my hand and said, ‘ There, try that.’ I did try it
and with the most surprising results ; for even
after the first dose the heavy, languid feeling I
had experienced began to disappear. I was soon
able to get about, being quite free from all liver
weakness. After such a happy experience lam
only too glad to testify to the efficacy of this
medicine, and I would further recommend ladies
suffering as I was to take a few of Warner’s Safe
Pills, which greatly aid the efficacy of Warner’s
Safe Cure.”*

M. A. means (to the Devil’s Brigade) :
Many Legal Advantages.
Apology for the protean Argus : One hun-
dred eyes, fifty heads, fifty opinions.
Premier Turner’s enemies say he came in,
like General Grant, when others had exhausted all
the possibilities of failure.
Alex. Kethel, M.L.C., says that, when in
N.S.W, Council, he feels that he is in “ an intel-
lectual atmosphere.” A three-hatmosphere.
Acting-Gov. Madden’s little brother asserts
with the air of a martyr that he is always at a
heavy loss in representing a constituency. But
what about the heavy loss of the poor con-
stituency ?
N. Blub Book shows that there are
still 21 Anglican clergymen receiving pensions
which in ’94 amounted to .£3846 15s. 4d. Eleven
R.O.’sget £ 2275; five Presbyterians ,£702; and
five Wesleyans .£687 10s.
There is now but one titled man in N.S.W.
Leg. Assembly, and as he is Speaker his legisla-
tive influence on political principles is nil. Com-
mittee details, where he might exert himself, he
detests. So he’s really nil.
The Dean-scandal resuscitation and the
Johnson-conviction confirmation are the rockers
on which the Windeyer cradle is to continue to be
rocked, to the lullaby of the “ system’’-hushing
brigade that adores the Australian woolsack.
Yic. Water Commission’s little account
has gone in, and, amongst other items, is one set-
ting forth the cost of 1200 cigars consumed during
one short trip. Most commissions begin and end
in smoke-when they don’t begin and end in
drink, or both.
About the shortest Act on record was that
reducing the salary of the S.A. Governor to
.£4OOO. It read: “ The Governor’s Salary Act,
1866, is hereby repealed.” It could hardly have
been shorter unless it had simply read, “Gov.
screw, £4OOO. ”
Premier Reid’s Ministry contains a greater
number of avowed Temperance advocates than
any Ministry which preceded it in N.S.W. ; yet
the Temperance party outside Parliament never
had so small a chanoe.Df obtaining legislation on
the lines they want.
Michael Davibt heard Labor-leader Tren-
with in Vic. Assembly last week and formed a
tall opinion of his debating ability. When Tren-
with goes to England to have his eyes operated on
at the end of the present Parliamentary session, he
will find a good friend in Davitt.
Abill—which,
unfortunately, is
not at all likely to
pass—for the abo-
lition of the free
railway pass curse
is now before
N. S. W. Parlia-
ment. The recent
commission of in-
quiry urges its
abolition in Vic-
toria also as one
of the necessary
economies which
are to put the
railways on a sol-
vent basis. Maori-
land is moving in
the same direc-
tion. A recent
M.L. Parliamen-
tary return shows
that passes are
habitually given
to naval officers,
captains of mer-
chant vessels visit-
ing the province,
local and foreign
legislators and
their wives, and
“distinguished
visitors ” in gene-
ral. A large num-
ber of foreign par-
sons, two foreign
bishops, the
Mayor of Mel-
bourne, and
J oseph Batten-
berg “ and valet ”
are some of the
visitors whose ap-
pearance on the
list is rousing the
bile of the M.L,

A SKETCH IN THE “POLICE NEWS" [?]ANNER.
“When a new flagellator is engaged the authorities provide a dummy
figure dressed like a prisoner, with a leather square sewn on the back, exactly
where the Flows should be administered. The new-chum hangman comes
down to A Division for several days to try his 'prentice hand on the
figure."—DAILY PAPER.

Guvnor. Couldn't yer let me have a figger [?] squeaks, just to
encourage me like?”
way-fare in these blawsted “kawlinies.”
S. M. Herald now takes up the parable that
N.S.W. Govt, should be able to induce the M.L.
■Govt, to abandon the duty on “green fruit,”
because N.S.W. is removing her barriers to inter-
provincial exchange. Mauriland’s most natural
reply must be—“ That’s no advantage to us.
You’re removing your barriers to all the world
alike; how does that specially favor us? Until
you can reciprocate with some concession, on goes
our duty against you.” Freetrade and reciprocity
are unblendable.
Westralian Govt., the most “loyal” in
the group, is rewarded by the present of an army
colonel named Smith as Governor. Plainly, if
titles are wanted for local toadies to grease,
“loyalty” doesn’t pay. The more rebellious a
province, the greater its prestige at Downing-
sfcreet.
Dan O’Connor, M.L.C., one of N.S.W.
Premier Reid’s “10 commandments,” on the
Council B.eform Bill: “No man in his senses will
vote for the Bill exactly as it is.” Corollary:
“No man in his senses would have drafted the
Bill exactly as it is.” First mutiny in the Reid
brigade.
Dr. Bowker, M.L.C. (N.S.W.): “Since
we’ve had that Education Act, which makes the
worship of God a secondary matter, the country
seems to have been under a curse. We have had
the divorce laws, the payment op members, and,
finally, Mr, REID.” Heaven forbid ! Not
“ finally.”
S.A. Education Dept, prints all its own
reading-books, which are monthly serials compiled
in the department. They thus contain much local
matter, are up-to-date, fresh and interesting to
the pupils. Also, they bring in to the Govt, a
profit of J 61500 a year. Vic. Govt, thinks of doing
similarly.
Nearly every S.A. legal M.P. has trotted
out Law Reform, but Kingston “overlays ” them
all with a measure providing that anyone who
passes reasonable examinations may practise law.
Good. “I am going,”'he says, “to introduce a
measure of law-reform which will sever the friend-
ships of years.”
During the last three years the retrench-
ments made in N.S. Wales civil service total
.£1,300,000. Premier Reid now proposes a further
retrenchment of ,£200,000. Inference—for over
a decade N.S.W. has been paying away a million
and a half yearly in salaries to persons whose
work was not wanted.
The electoral tocsin is beginning to ring in
the land of Boodlewraith. “ Dick ” Newton, the
sporting auctioneer, is after the Barcoo, at present
held by Labor-member Kerr, and the hyphenated
Curtain-Minns will run for the Flinders, another
Labor electorate. Minns is the advance-agent
and lecturer for the Bulcoeky Political League,
fathered by Premier Nelson.
Australia still continues to be smeared by
the Dirty Colors of Asia. How is the smear-
ing to be stopped ? Procure a white man in the
advanced stages of leprosy. Take him on tour
through the country. Exhibit him in all the
centres of population as an object-lesson. This
will raise “such a sudden flood of mutiny ” that
the Dirty Colors will be wiped out for ever.
Murray Smith votes now and then with
the protectionists on questions of Vic. “Tariff
Reform,” but only when the proposed reduction
in duty is very rough on vested interests. A con-
scientious Tory freetrader is M. S. Down with
the Tariff, but don’t be too rough on good old
Capital. Like the fair Desdemotia, he doth per-
ceive a divided duty in these cases.
Thejnsertion of the “Divine guidance”
phrase in the speech at"the opening of present
N.S. W. Parliament, and the subsequent proclama-
tion of a day of humiliation and prayer for rain (not
to mention the forthcoming day of thanksgiving),
are reckoned to have attached to the Reid Govt,
a large amount of church influence which was on
the point of going over to the political enemy.
In N.S.W. Legislative Council. Campbell;
“ The hon. gentleman (Salomons) judges humanity
by his own profession, where he sees the worst
side of human nature.” Salomons : “I never had
you for a client.” Jack Want : “That’s why he
has got lots of money left.”
When old dogs bark,
They lack the bite of youth j
When shark meets shark,
Then comes the tu-Of truth.
Melbournean : “ Hancock has by no means
raised his status in this Parliament, and Tren-
with stands yards higher. Barrel Hancock is
far too glib with interruptions, but when it comes
to his own speech, the affair is thin, though his
mellifluous fashion of oratory is deceptively
pleasing in contrast to Trenwith’s hoarse and
raucous notes and angular style, careless of effect,

in, an’ to set yer milk in, an' to bathe the kid in—but I be

■ ily digging down into his matter, of which there
is always lots.”
Premier Reid’s taunt that the pugnacious
Sohey is not “ a Labor representative who has the
manliness to join a league with his own fellow
laborers,” is signal evidence of a runaway tongue.
Has not Reid, oftener than he has hairs on his
head, declared that the taking of the Solidarity
Labor pledge proved political cowardice instead
of manliness ? And will he not, as soon as he and
the Labor-party come to the parting of the ways,
repeat the contemptuous utterance ? Manliness,
according to the Premier, evidently means stick-
ing to the Government.
William Robert Campbell, M.L.C., the
Reidite of the N.SAV. Council, who posed re-
cently as the red Radical of that Chamber —the
“ fly in amber ” ! —has treated the public to some
of his own ideas of legislative reform. He wants
to see in the Council—Reid’s future Council —the
Admiral, the Commandant, the Bishops, the Car-
dinal, the Protestant “Popes,” and “meneminent
in literature.” “The Banjo,” M.L.C. ! And
why not also the Judges, the Sheriff, the eminent
Bum-Bailiffs, the Public Executioner, and the
Inspector of Stray Dogs ?
A Victorian ex-M. L.A. frankly admitted
to the Vic. Railway Board that he “ had assisted
on several occasions to keep men in the depart-
ment who, by getting drunk while in charge of
trains and by general neglect of duty, deserved
dismissal.-” Tnese drunks were, his own con-
stituents, and he did it, admittedly, for the sake
of their votes. So did almost every other M.L. A.,
and none of them apparently was ashamed of it.
Even Deakin once read, in open court, a letter
from himself to Speight, in which he urged the
railway commissioner to do something or other
which he shouldn't have done for Deakin’s con-
stituency, and presented it as evidence of the
manner in which Spefght was “influenced” by
politicians.
Outside adherents of the N.S.W. Govern-
ment free-port policy are strenuously endeavoring
to resuscitate the old Freetrade and Liberal Asso-
ciation —but encounter the money-getting diffi-
culty. Pulsford’s organisation had some strong
men at its back—instance Burdekin, who equipped
the body with offioes gratis. This support is no
longer forthcoming. Reid forfeited it witli his
Land and Income Tax proposals, and, now that
the pillars and props are gone, there is little hope
for a successful resurrection. Freetraders in
Parliament disfavor the project, recognising that
active branches in their constituencies might dis-
cover fitter persons than themselves—an easy
business in many cases—and their attitude is like
that of one staunch Reidite who refused to con-
tribute to the Foreign-trade council’s expenses at
the election, and told Varney Parkes and co. that
he’d see them in the Devil’s Pocket constituency
before he’d spend a halfpenny on electioneering
outside his own “ beat.”
G. C. Baker is taking to the Privy Council
his case against W. J. Traylen, the I orrestrahan
alleged to have sat and voted in toe
Assembly while a Govt, contractor. Govt, hastily
passed a retrospective Indemnity Act after the
action was commenced against its friend, ana
though W.A. Supreme Court has held the thing
valid, there is a strong chance that the decision
will be overset.
Wilson, the scare-monger of the In-
vestok’s Review (London), announced lately that
Vic. Judge Molesworth’s salary had been cut
down .£250 per annum because he refused a
certificate to a certain insolvent boom-legislator,
Attorney-General Cuthbert, mentioning the
matter in the Leg. Council, took occasion to re-
mark that Wilson was a liar, and Service added
that he was also a blackguard.
G. H. Reid: “I
am naturally of a
soft disposition.” Soft-
goods disposition, he
means.
When the S.A.
election comes on King-
ston will have an excit-
ing time. Adelaide is
the most snufflesome
city in Australia, and
as Kingston is not suffi-
ciently clammy and
fish-like to be a saint,
his enemies have con-_
eeived the idea of look-
ing up his past record,
and laying it before the
electors all in a heap.
They are said to have
got the name of every
girl Kingston has
winked at, or looked as
if he would like to wink
at, for 30 years past,
with a full affidavit
from her big brother as
to the circumstances.
Also, they have notes
of every occasion in his
life when the Premier
has been out late, and
some occasions when
he didn’t get home at
all,.and reports of in-
criminating remarks he
has made in his sleep,
and medical opinions
as to th 6 state of his
breath ever since the
year 1870, and expert
evidence as to the al-
leged wild appearance
of his eye, and a photo-
graph of a doorstep
down which he was
seen to rush hurriedly
under mysterious cir-
cumstances. And all
this testimony is to be
thrown at his head
simultaneously, if the
ancient and fishy party
in S.A. politics feels
that it can throw
straight enough when
the occasion arrives.
The Vic. Assembly, during the recent
tariff debate, put a certain variety of Carriage-
bolts on the free-list because it was assured by
some Freetrade members that they weren’t made
ip the province. Also, it put brushes on thefree-
bst because they were only manufactured locally
011 a ver y small scale. It afterwards transpired
that the local brush-making industry was rattier a
big affair, and that_ the aforesaid bolts had been
manufactured in Victoria for 14 years past. An
Assembly which flounders along in such pitiable
ignorance of the conditions of the country for
which it is legislating is a fine example of bow the
world is governed.
Spagnoletti : “ Twain’s reception is a hand-
shake by Australia to America. The English
authorities do all they can to squelch Australian
interest in the U.S., but I venture to say no
English writer would receive such a welcome as
Clemens’s. American news must needs be filtered
f° us through England, wherefore there is none
f°f weeks together, so that the great Republic
might as well be a black blot on the map. There-
fore, we want the Pacific cable as immediately as
possible. Meanwhile, look at the dismal trash
with which the cablegrapher furnishes us, as a
kind of scullery, or servants’ ’awll, to the habsorb-
ingly hinteresting Henglish Harristocracy.

The Rev. Dr. Torrence moved—
“ That it is imperative that a united
effort'be made to provide a * living
wage ’ for all stipendary servants of
the church, and to secure as far as
possible the regular and punctual
payment of the same.” Mr. Grim-
wade, M.L 0., said that in many

many churches for the population.
He knew of one village containing
only 200 people with no fewer than
five churches to accommodate them.

The Giants’ Fight and the After-Battle:
a Glimpse of “the Noble Art.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was a 24ft. ring, whose upper ropes were bound
with red cloth. At first, these red ropes had no
meaning ; but later, they acquired a terrible signi-
ficance—later, when they marked the bounds of
the arena of blood, and strained and groaned under
the weight of the slaughtered Plaoke.
# # *
In one corner sat Barker, the Queensland giant,
with Dooley, Dunn and Seymour, all famous
pugs, standing behind him; and opposite, seconded
by Tom Taylor, Thompson and Floyd, sat Placke,
the great, handsome, wholesome-looking, honest-
faced, clear-skinned Dutchman. The groups had
only two unscientific men—the two principals.
A Sydney civic official and two turfmen were
timekeepers; Mr. Colonel Macdonald, as the
blundering ring-steward put it, was referee. And
the crowd which had come to the bloody feast was
addressed as “gentlemen,” and politely requested
to keep silence when the referee should count the
seconds over a fallen gladiator.
• # «
“Time!” and the giants shaped, while the
breathless crowd noted that Plaoke, Hercules as he
was, with his 6ft. 5£in. and 16st. 71b,, magnificent
proportions, and limbs which carried him 18 miles
in bitterly-cold open-ocean waters against the rage
of a North Sea tempest, nevertheless looked small
before the towering 6ft. lOin. Barker. Never
before in the history of pugilism had such a pair
met; never before had one-fifth of a ton of live
meat been called upon by soienced-seconds to glut
a well - moneyed crowd with slow, unscientific
butchery.
* * *
The Queensland giant placed his Heaven-born
policeman’s foot well forward in defiance, and
behind it waved the ponderous fists through which
Placke had to break in order to strike face or
body. Placke began the fighting, trying to reach
Barker’s face, and Barker’s seconds chuckled as
they saw how totally unscientific was the simple-
minded foe, and laughed boisterously when their
principal’s right struck Placke upon the jaw, send-
ing him down. That blow would have settled
almost any other man, but Placke’s great heart
and unabused constitution gave him fresh lease of
life. The second round was likewise Barker’s—
he smashed Placke on the left eye, nose and
mouth, causing the blood to flow; and the fight
seemed all over—the reporters put away their
note-books. But, with the third round, Placke
came out fresh again, and, beaten man as he was,
he forced the fighting, hurling himself upon
Barker, smashing him over the right eye, and
making the blood spurt from mouth and nose.
There was consternation in the Barker camp;
the seconds’ jubilation changed to dismay and
excitement. It wasn’t all over; the beaten man’s
pluck and strength were undying. Dooley clenched
his hands at Placke’s onslaught, and shouted,
“Left, Dick! Left! Left!’’ and at last Dick
shot the left with a staggering blow, which almost
sent Placke down, and made the bright blood
stream down his face from a deep cut under the
eye. Dooley and co. “kidded’’ Barker as they
rubbed him down. “ But moind what I tell you,”
said Dooley, “keep away.”
# # #
In the fourth round, Placke made Barker
“smell hell;” he punched him hard upon the belly
and made him groggy. Placke’s rushing was
cowing Barker, whose seconds, in the minute
interval, “kidded” their man vigorously, while
Placke’s instructed him to rush again and infight
Barker during the fifth round. Had Placke
obeyed his seconds he might have won; but he
allowed Barker to pull himself together in the
fifth round, and that and the sixth were mostly
feinting and glaring. With the seventh round the
fierceness of the battle recommenced, and Placke
reeled back upon the ropes with the blood gushing
from eye, nose, and mouth and falling upon his
breast, down which it streamed in many rivulets.
And from that on the rounds were rounds of
blood. As the exhausted men sparred for
breath, and the audience sat mute, many
of them paralysed with the horror of the
spectacle, Placke’s blood could be heard drip,
drip, drip upon the stage, and Barker
would suddenly spring back and spit from his
throat the blood which threatened to choke him.
Placke often drank his —Barker’s manoeuvre was
too risky in his exhausted state. The gloves were
red and chitted ; the stage was slippery. “Resin ! ”
cried one of Barker’s seconds, “ resin—Dick can’t
stand,” and in the minute interval one second
rubbed resin upon Barker’s while Abe
Willis sucked the giant’s eye, which was fast
closing up.
* # #
After every round the seconds sponged their
men on face and body,'fanned them, “kidded”
them, and sent them up again. But Placke was,
practically, dying. His left eye was closed, and
the left side of his face was a great blot of blood,
which, when the men clinched, left a big red
patch upon Barker’s chest. And in these clinches
the men’s bloody arms and gloves, passing round
each other’s bodies, left their trunks almost
covered with smudges of gore. The beaten Placke
was knocked down again and again, but he rose
every time to present his poor, hideously-battered
face to the onslaught of the foe. There was not
a man among the officials there to raise his voice
against this butchery. No police interfered. But
at last the referee stopped the fight by hailing
Barker as the victor. Placke was lifted off the
ropes and borne to his corner.
# # #
Then, in his dressing-room, surrounded by his
seconds, by Barker’s seconds, and the chief M.C.,
Placke, unconscious, began a long and grim
struggle with Death. This was the after-battle in
which the poor, unscienced Dutchman took an
unconscious part, but in which all the experienced
abettors fought desperately against outraged
Nature and avenging Law. Their hearts turned
cold, cold as the body of Placke as it lay there
upon a mattress. They tried to put whisky down
his throat; they held him up and gave him a
teaspoonful, and he threw up over a half-pint of
bloorL Then he swooned off. Two of the party
began to tremble. “ He’s gone! ” said one.
This roused a master - spirit that was there.
“Never mind,” said he, “you’ll only get
seven years like the rest of us. Don’t stand
trembling! If he dies, you and will get
weak enough together on seven years of bran-
mash and hominy. Rub him with whisky.” And
the master-spirit poured the whisky upon Placke’s
body, and the seconds rubbed and chafed it. One
man, in the near presence of an awful calamity,
alone kept his nerve. As Death came closer he
turned him aside with a bold thrust. Seeing a
sickly-looking man stoop down and rub Placke's
feet, he shouted with ironical emphasis—“ Don’t
you rub his feet, you will give him typhoid fever !
You get away and get hurled. Only a strong man
should rub him.” The sickly-looking man left.
And the rubbing went on, while the bold one
explained why he wasn’t a teetotaller. “An old
lady,” he said, “whom I loved was pronounced
dead by two doctors. We rubbed her with
whisky and she lived seven years after.” Placke
showed no signs of reviving ; his breathing was
stertorous. “I have thrown a boot at a man for
snoring half as loud as that,” said the nerveful
gentleman.
* ♦ ♦ ♦
There was a hush when the doctor came. He
put his stethoscope to the man’s heart, he felt his
pulse, he opened the one eye which it was possible
to open, and stooping down and holding a lighted
match over it, examined the pupil. None of the
seconds dared speak. The doctor, it was plain,
was most unfavorably impressed ; but the man of
nerve spoke up without a quail in his heart, with-
out a quaver in his voice. “ You see, doctor,
there’s the wrist-hitter, the elbow-hitter, and the
shoulder-hitter. Now, the man this man fought
is a wrist-hitter.” “What gave him that eye?”
asked the doctor. “ Wrist hitting,” said the iron
one. “Now, what do you think of it, doctor?”
The doctor looked down at Placke, whose face
might have been struck by a half-spent round-
shot. “ There’s great shock to the system ; the
man is very weak ; his heart very slow ; the bone
of the left eyebrow is fractured ; and there is con-
cussion of the brain.” That startled the stony
one just the least bit. “Concussion of the brain ! ”
THE BATTLE OF THE GIANTS.
HARRY PLACKE, the Dutchman
(6ft. 5[?]in.).
DICK BARKER, the Queensland Giant
(6ft. 10in.). [Kerry, Photo.
he exclaimed, with loud incredulity. “ Why, he
hasn’t any brain ! Besides, he must have got it
before he came in. ”
# * •
“ How old is he ?” asked the doctor. “ Twenty-
five, ” said someone. “It would be a great pity if
anything happened to such a splendid man, the
doctor continued, with the admiration of the pro-
fessional anatomist, “ but I can t say whether he 11
come round yet or not. He might come round.”
The tough one stepped aside. “The doctor
don’t kid me,” he said. “ He’ll come
round, with his constitution, all right ! If
he’d won the fight, he’d be all right now,
but his heart’s broken with being beaten.
Why, I remember when the Nigger fought
Dooley ! Why, the Nigger hit him on the point
with the force of the lightning, and it lifted
Dooley clean off his feet, and knocked the bone
out near the eye in a lump as big as a goose-egg.
And didn’t we squirm for three hours after ; we
were frightened, but Dooley came round all right.’
• * •
Here the doctor spoke. “You have seen a
man pull through after being as bad as this?
“Lord, yes, doctor —why I had both my eye-
brows fraetured, and look at me! A man’s as old
as he feels, and I’m 25. I’d take Placke’s chance
fora tenner; don’t you remember how Trickett
went like this after his race with Hanlan ! Insen-
sible for four hours, and then springing up as
lively as a buck wallaby.”
* # •
“What gave him this terrible eye? ” asked the
doctor, as he applied the ice-cap to Placke’s head.
“Well,” said the other, “you see, he met a
policeman outside, and told him he wasn’t hand-
some, and the policeman hit Him with the baton.”
The doctor wanted Placke to be taken to the
hospital, but was temporarily overruled : “He
can only get a good doctor and best attention
there, and he can have those here.” About mid-
night the doctor went away, leaving word* to call
him should Placke seem worse.
There was silence, broken by one of the seconds
striking a match in order to look into Placke’s
eye. The Nerveful One was up. “ What are you
striking a match for? Keep your claw out of his
eye ; bad luck’s sure to come if you have your claw
in it. Your hair won’t want cropping for your
seven years. You’re bald now.” The second blew
out the match. “ Weak ? ” ironically exclaimed
Mr. Orit. “ Weak ? the doctor says—he —is—
WEAK ! He’s strong enough to pull the tusks
out of an elephant. And Game ! he’d fight a cir-
cular-saw driven by the thunder ! ”
“Yes,” said one of the seconds, “they can’t
say this Hollander isn’t game; he’s fighting now”
—and, lifting up the blanket, he showed Placke’s
hands tightly clenched and moving automatically
as if in battle.
“That’s a good symptom,” remarked one
second. “ Of course it is ,” said Mr. Grit; “it’s
the mind contro.lin’ the body. Take that look
off your face,” said Mr. Grit to one second.
“ You’ll turn the man into a seven years’ corpse.”

They took the poor Dutchman to the hospital
some hours later, and when this went to the
printer he was—after four days—still fighting his
battle with Death.

The oldest N.S.W. pensioner of any grade
is the perennial F. L. S. Merewether, ex-clerk
of the Executive Council, who, since 6th Jan.,
’56, has annually drawn £9OO. Forty years on
Jan. 6 next, at £9OO a year, is just £36,000.
Another N.S.W. judicial pension (£lB2O
annually) lias fallen in through the death, at Turn
bridge Wells, of that curious old gentleman, ex-
Justice Deffell. Ex-Justice Foster now stands
alone as a Supreme Court pensioner, but it seems
certain that there will be other retirements ere
long.
The greatest compliment one can pay an
Irishman (although his accent may be a pro-
nounced Kerry) is to mistake him for an English-
man. Even Michael Davitt is reported to have
said: “A good many people are surprised I
haven’t a brogue.”
A thrill of horror ran through Belgravia,
the month before last, when a certain gilded
colonist in London, replying to a letter signed
“Ripon,” committed the shocking blunder of
addressing the Secretary of State for the Colonies
as “Mr. Ripon, Downing-street.”
Canny “ Dauvit ” Mitchell, Melba’s pa,
has opened his raild-cure-bacon works at Cave

company charnpagned over the dead porkers.
“ Dauvit ” anticipates doing 500 pigs per day.
Melb. solicitor Sincock, gaoled for refusing
to have his child vaccinated, writes through the
Herald a farewell to his friends, in which he
quotes the stanza from Lovelace beginning,
“ Stone walls do not a prison make.” Who would
have thought that there was a poetic element in
calf-lymph ?
“It is, after all, an advantage in the
House of Commons,’’ writes a London correspon-
dent to The Bulletin, “ to have once kept a pub.
Bailey, of Bailey’s Hotel, and Tom Curran, late

Bishop Goe, visiting Lockwood, Vic ,
swallowed a cup of coffee hurriedly at a tea-fight,
to find later on that he became suddenly indis-
posed. Some dirty person had made the coffee with
water out of an abandoned tank, where slime and
dead flies and the late lamented cat had been
accumulating for years.
Mark Twain’s opinion of Louis Becke :
“‘By Reef and Palm’ is one of the best books
that has been produced in recent years. Becke is
a man who knows the South Seas thoroughly, and
has the true feeling for life in these islands. He
writes finely, and I think his name is bound to be
heard of prominently in literature.”
The Governor-elect of Westralia, Colonel
Gerard Smith, is a cousin of Earl Carington.
Which is no particular recommendation, consider-
ing that Gov. Carington aforesaid is in Australia
chiefly known as the person who hanged four boys
who were tried till 4 o’clock in the morning.
The Brookmans, the biggest holders of
Great Boulder shares, are both Adelaide men.
One of them was a partner in a retail grocery, and
the other was a not over-successful jam-manu-
facturer before going to the West. Between them
they hold nearly 50,000 shares —say .£350,000.
A potentate who has been “doing”
Westralia for a London illustrated paper, started
for Southern Cross dressed like a war-correspon-
dent, with a revolver ostentatiously displayed in
his belt and a big sheath-knife located under each
coat-tail. Also, he took with him a private-secre-
tary and a mountain of luggage, including a China
tea-service.
Hori Grey himself relates that George
Meredith, the well-known novelist, to whom the MS.
of Rees’ “ Life and Times of Sir George Grey ” was
submitted by Chapman and Hall for judgment,
returned it with a memo, thus: “I don’t think
there would be any demand for this book if
printed, Sir George Grey being a comparatively
unknown man.”
“‘Mark Twain’ is my trademark,” said
the Innocent Abroad to a Melb. Herald reporter.
“I see,” said the simpering scribe, “your twain
mark, as it were.” Then this amiable zoological
curiosity, who had travelled down from Albury
with the “Murkan,” blandly adds that “Mr.
Clemens seemed completely worn out when he
stepped off the train at Melbourne.”
When G. Republican Dibbs reached
Townsville, the other day, they put him into an
ordinary six-foot half-tester bed, the consequence
being that 4in. of Dibbs stuck out into space. In
the morning the long man made one or two
prayerful remarks and shook the dust off his feet.
On the Towers, however, they were equal to the
emergency, and a special bed was rigged for
Damchicago.
The Duke of York, heir to the British
Crown, who cadged complete collections of stamps
(worth hundreds of pounds in the open market)
from N.S.W. and other Australasian Govts., has,
it is cabled, sold the whole of his philatelical kit
to one of the Rothschilds for £56,000. This is
royalty’s latest device for turning a dishonest
penny—for neither N.S.W. nor any other pro-
vince would provide free stamps for Baron Ferdi-
nand de Rothschild. But such things are in the
blood. Didn’t Alfred Edinburgh sell all his Aus-
tralian presents by auction?
J. G. Ward, the “Pooh-Bah” of Maori-
land, is a self-made man. As a youth, he
was a storeman in the employ of Nioholl and
Tucker, at Invercargill. Having saved money, he
set up a business of his own, which, in course of
time, developed into the Farmers’ Co-operative
Association, for which he is said to have raised a
capital of .£50,000 while in London. His straight-
forward and business-like dealings won the con-
fidence of the farmers, who put him into Parlia-
ment. Mrs. Ward is the daughter of a successful
trader. When presented at the Queen’s drawing-
room, she could give points in appearance to most
of the aristocratic debutantes. Ward has a mar-
vellous grasp of figures, and is free from “side.”
Hori Grey, since his return to England,
has been besieged by all sorts of cranks and fad-
dists. A musical genius wrote a plausible letter,
full of high-flown compliments, inviting the old
man to collaborate with him in composing a Maori
opera. He was enthusiastic over the project, and
confident that there would be millions in it.
Grey’s private secretary was instructed to arrange
an interview, but when the author of the brilliant
idea presented himself at No. 7 Park Place, he
turned out to be a seedy-looking individual with
a purple proboscis and a general appearance of
chronic dissipation. The negotiations abruptly fell
through when he asked the old man to put up a
trifle of £5O for preliminary expenses.

nervous system, rendering fatigue unknown, and
enabling the partaker to perform remarkable feats
of muscular strength and long-sustained endur-
ance. Prepared in the form of pills. Price 2s. 6d.,

READ WHAT
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
did for the Invalid Daughter of a Prom-
inent Lowell Tradesman.
“My daughter had for a long time been
troubled with violent headaches and sleep-
lessness. She was pale, had no appetite,
and was losing flesh rapidly. She took
various remedies for her trouble, but re-
ceived no benefit until she commenced using
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. After taking half a
.bottle, she began to feel better. By a con-
tinued use of this medicine, her appetite re-
turned, her cheeks began to fill out and show
color, she gained in strength, her headaches
disappeared, she slept better, and now says
she feels like a new person.”—F. P. Cogges-
hall, 6 Lyon St., Lowell.

Query—whether the production of spirits
at a seance isn’t a violation of the Excise-law ?
Answer—No ; because the so-called spirits are too
far below proof.
A writer in Sheffield Weekly Telegraph
makes his hero visit “the faro hells in Bourke-
street, Melbourne,” and speaks of a miirder
committed in 1885 “in the desolate bush at Flem-
ington, Victoria.”
The stuffed “ Tantanoola wolf ” is now in
Adelaide Zoo. Hitherto the owners have resisted
all attempts to photo, the beast, which the taxi-
dermist has tried to make look as bulky and tiger-
like as possible. It is a true Asiatic wolf and
quite a handsome animal.
That favorite food, Parsons’ Flaked Oat-
meal, steadily grows in public favor. It makes
bone and muscle and endurance, therefore it is
especially suited to the young man who goes on
the land, to wrestle with the stupendous gum-tree
whose bottom roots are down along with Cain and
Ananias in perdition, and with the kangaroos and
the mortgage and the drought. Also, it is the
only food that is equal to the case of the prospector,
who picks his way through rooks as tough as the
devil’s coat of mail, only to land on wash that
yields one speck to a mountain ; and it is a restora-
tive for the jaw-weary politician and insurance-
fiend, and for the military person whose feet are
tired with retreating at the Easter sham-fight, and
other exhausted citizens in every walk of life.
Every person who wants to live to be 116, and be
an oldest inhabitant, and have his portrait pub-
lished in the papers when he dies, should use it.*

and all who saw her thought
we should never he aide to

hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ‘ Benger's
Food.' From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength."

The Coming Human Race.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I can see it,” said the cynic, as he raised his
weary face ;
“ There will nothing be bub poets in the coming
human race.
From their infancy to manhood, and the highest
to the low,
All will put their thoughts in metre and in rhyme
will tell their woe.
“ Bub I hope that God will call me from this earth
before the time
When the babies in their cradles yell for Ma in
noisy rhyme ;
And the schoolboys ‘ playing marbles ’ in the
backyard of their home
Reckon up their stony winnings in a swinging
little ‘ pome.’
“Grant, O Lord, my bones are resting where no
wattle-blossoms bloom,
And no leery mulga-poets write an ode on every
tomb —
When the time has come; and parsons metrify
their ancient tale,
And they set to jingling verses regulations in the
gaol.
“ Life on earth will be a torture hardly equalised
in hell
When the fishwife gets poetic and the bookie
rhymes his yell,
And the Irish foot-policeman sings a ballad in the
court
Of a black-eyed little damsel who indulged in too
much port.
“ Lord have mercy,’ is my prayer while I yet
have breath and life ;
Slay my body, I implore Thee, ere the wretched
days arrive
When the Parliamentary speeches nought but
blankest verses be,
And the trouser-wearing women rhyme their
slander over tea.
“ Should St. Peter not admit me to the great and
holy show,
I shall gladly enter Sheol rather than return
below,
Where the larrikins in stanzas most abominably
curse,
And the highly-learned Judges sentence you to
death in verse !”

The Sydney Fine-Art Exhibitions.
Whether or not the long-impending division in
the ranks of her artists, which has led to N.S.W.
possessing two Societies instead of one, has put
the painters on their mettle during the year, it is
certain that the two Exhibitions just opened dis-
play a distinct advance. The elder society,
located in its old rooms, now considerably en-
larged, displays 343 exhibits, of which 163 are oils,
and 144 water-color drawings ; while the infant
(though remarkably mature) institution hangs on
the tastefully-arranged walls of the York-street
Rink 121 works in oils and 48 in watercolor, with
exhibits of other kinds which bring the total up to
223. The Art Society has indeed many pro-
ductions that could have been advantageously
dispensed with, many whose presence is dis-
tinctly prejudicial to the cause of Art, and
some which, though of more or less promise, will
hardly bear criticism ; but there are still pictures
enough of a character to make their mark in any
exhibition. The .'-ociety of Artists shows little
that could profitably be eliminated, and the
standard of achievement is generally higher
than any heretofore reached by local painters,
though there is no work, perhaps, of .such
general attractiveness as several exhibited at the
Pitt-street rooms.
# # •
The sixteenth annual exhibition of the Art
Society occupies three rooms, of which the old one
is now devoted exclusively to water-color, black
and white, &c. The Vice-President, Mr. W.
Lister Lister, enters, this year, both literally and
figuratively, “ fresh fields and pastures new.”
His most important contribution (why use the
word “bracken” in Australia?), “Through the
Bracken ” (43), with a canvas some 9ft. by 6ft., is,
when seen from a sufficient distance, a perfect
piece of half-wild Nature, with the fresh and
living greens relieved by the silvery reflection of
the sunlight on the fern-fronds, and by the ruddy
browns of last year’s growth. To the weary,
pent-up denizen of the city such a work is a
veritable joy. “a. Fig-tree Grove ” (76) is a large
and splendid study of Australian foliage, with the
sun pleasantly chequering the carpet of dead
leaves; while “Unchangeable, save in the Wild
Waves’ Play ” (69) is as distinguished for the
glorious color of the scarcely swelling water as is
“ The Wild, Wild Sea, that No Man Knows ”
(49) for the frostlike freshness of the sparkling
surf. Mr. Arthur Collingridge is best seen in
“Morning, Sydney Harbor” (7), and in “The
City of the Plains ” (39), with the mist empurpling
the urban dwellings, while a golden effulgence
sheds itself upon the hills. “ Ploughing in
Bathurst Plains ” (15) is a creditable production,
and “Locksley, near Bathurst ” (189), a cheerful
country scene in water-colors.
• * *
Seldom has Mr. W. O. Piguenit so thoroughly
excelled himself as in “ The Flood in the
Darling, 1890 ” (25). Here we have a masterful
transcript of Nature under exceptional conditions.
The composition of the picture is unexceptionable;
and the closely studied drawing of the ever-
changing clouds is as admirable as the tender
shimmer on the wide expanse of placid waters.
“A Tarn, Western Highlands of Tasmania” (6)
is a good example of the favorite painter’s best-
known style of work, with clouds of mist boiling
around the half-illumined craggy peaks, and cattle
browsing on the margin of the unruffled lakelet.
Mr. George Collingridge is more than usually to
the fore in his habitual style of work, the most
prominent example of which is “ Mangrove Creek,
Hawkesbury River” (90), a view painted with
excessive conscientiousness; while of Mr. C. H.
Hunt’s varied contributions the happiest, per-
haps, is “Morning on the Murrumbidgee ” (245),
a spacious stretch of lofty hill and meadow.
# # *
Figure subjects are not as yet a strong feature
of Australian Art, but Mr. Gordon Coutts makes
an exceptionally noteworthy departure in this
direction. In “ Too Late ” (42) —a priest present-
ing the crucifix to a dying youth as he lies upon
his pallet in a humble cottage—we have the best
example of this branch of painting yet displayed
in a Sydney exhibition. While the treatment, as
a whole, is more than satisfactory, portions of it
are extremely fine—such as, for instance, the very
skilful handling of the ministering cleric’s head.
The intensity of exalted expression shown in the
glowing features of the Church’s servant is in
touching contrast with the pallid aspect of the
face from which are fading the last gleams of
consciousness ; while the tender pathos with which
the simple story is told, is heightened by a mastery
of drawing and a subdued power of brushwork
which make the picture, perhaps, the painting of
the year. A more homely subject, but treated
quite as effectively in its way, is “ Washing Day”
(23), a typical old woman at the stove-boiler in a
typical Australian back-yard, with quite a twang
of the old Dutch school about her. “In a
Thoughtful Mood ” (26), by Mr. A. R. Coffey, a
curly head and shoulders peering, nude, from out
amass of furs, displays some excellent drawing
and good flesh tints. Other works of Mr. Coffey’s
are well deserving of attention, especially the
upper portion of “ Hard Times ” (16), with its
excellence of color. Mr. Albert Hanson appears
—for the first time, we think—as a figure-painter,
with “ Blacksmith ” (269), a powerful interior of a
forge with men at work, and “An Idyll” (249),
depicting mermaids in a cave, unpleasantly im-
aginative both in coloring and conception. Mr.
Hanson (whose work this year is entirely in water-
color) contributes, likewise, a number of little
English country subjects—perfect gems of their
kind —in addition to an exquisitely-painted coast-
scene, full of tender greys and browns, “TheSea-
birds’ Cry—the Music of the Sea ” (216).
# * *
Never has Mrs. Mary Stoddart produced a por-
trait so superb in her own particular manner as
that of Mrs. Roger Gadsden (44), an elderly lady
of refined and aristocratic mien, clad in black lace
and sables. Miss Edith E. Cusack sends a quan-
tity of startlingly-colored work, of which the best
examples are the portrait heads of “ Doreen ” (35),
an interesting young lady with a top-knot (in
oils), and (in pastels) “ Day Dreams ” (263), and
“Miss Weaver ” (275). Other excellent specimens
of women’s work are Miss Florence M. Green’s
“Fraulein M ” (147), very French and very
chic, and two heads of elderly ecclesiastics,
“ Pater Benedictus ” (125), and “ Brother Nicho-
las ” (149). Few better things by Mr. J. A. Ben-
nett have been seen than the colored head in
water-colors of “ Buila, a South Sea Islander”
(208), while his portrait of Mr. J. D. Fitzgerald
(50) is painted with his usual ultra-conscientious
care. Mr. J. Mather maintains his perennial ex-
cellence in water-colors. His “ Wintry Weather ”
(240) suggest almost a David Cox; “ Under the
Wattles” (196) is a finely-studied piece of hill
and foliage; and “Stony Creek” (256), remark-
able for its exquisite “quality,” depicts a barge
moored on the grey water, under an equally grey
sky. Mr. C. A. Tindall’s “ A Westerly, Circular
Quay ”(201), borders somewhat on the ideal, but
is extremely picturesque, and equally good in
composition, drawing, and coloring. The various
phases of bush life are truthfully, typically, and
most artistically illustrated, by Mr. Edward
Bevan, in some half-score of water-colors, all racy
ofjthe camp-fire, the “billy,” the “sundowner,”
and the “swag,” and are sure to find a
numerous circle of admirers. Bare mention is
all that is possible of Mr. Gerald Fitzgerald,
Mr. Harry G. Garlick (whose “Orphaned,” No.
62, is a work of much promise), Mr. J. Swinton
Diston, Miss Jessie Scarvell, Mr. J. H. Young,
Miss Goddard, Mr. G. V. F. Mann, Mrs, Butter-
worth, and others whose work contributes materi-
ally to the interest and value of the Exhibition.
In the same way, general reference only can be
made to the black-and-white and sculpture,
though the exhibits in these branches are far from
being unworthy of notice.
• # •
In the exhibition of the Society of Artists
the interest centres mainly in the oil paint-
ings. The most prominent production of
Mr. Tom Roberts is “ Bailed Up ” (29), in
which we see the mail-coach stopped by a gang
of bushrangers, on a road skirting a steep hill,
sparsely covered with scraggy trees. Thoroughly
Australian in subject, the scene is treated with
somewhat less life and vigor than might have been
expected. “In a Corner on the Maclntyre”
(17) shows careful painting of the tumbled masses
of white rock and their reflection in the water. A
small full-length panel portrait of Mr. L.
Hopkins (“Hop”—No. 8) is not only an
admirable likeness, but a masterful study in
browns ; while “ Maria Yulgilbah ” (31), the head
of a female aboriginal, and “ An Old Banjo ” (41),
a girl in a muslin bodice, seated and twanging the
favorite weapon of the irrepressible nigger, are
full of character and force. Undoubtedly Mr.
Roberts is most at home in portraits of women.
Mr. J. R. Ashton is singularly modest in point of
superficial area, but his work displays increasing
clearness of handling and directness of purpose.
He contributes a number of small pictures (56 and
67, 71 to 76, and 78 to 80) consisting of bits of old
Sydney and country subjects, all pourtrayed with
remarkable felicity. A lovely scene on the
Hawkesbury, and “Old Cottages, Cumberland-
street,” may be specially noted. His “ Study of a
Head ” (S 9), in pastels, is full of quiet power.
• » •
Few Australian artists throw more poetry into
their work than Mr. A. H. Fullwood, and
none, perhaps, has made greater strides
than his pictures show this year. “Aus-
tralia” (32) is quite a pastoral idyl, with its
browsing sheep in sunlit paddock bounded by
hills of misty grey : while “Solitude” (37), an
evening riverscape, with craggy heights in shadow
under a golden sky, and rushes rising from the
steely stream, describes the utterness, but not the
dreariness, of restful solitude. Again, “The New
Moon ” (100) is an exquisite scene of sunset over
pearly water, with the shore artistically
veiled. Not only in these oil-paintings, but also
in his watereolors, “ The Huon Belle ” (177) a
scene distinguished for the broad but careful
work and deft management of the light, and
“Becalmed” (196), with its wealth of delicate
color, Mr. Fullwood is artistically satisfying.
* * «
To many the most attractive picture of the
show will be Mr. Arthur Streeton’s “ Oblivion ”
(26). A female figure, of winsome mien,
and partially draped in silver gauze, is reclin-
ing on a ledge of silvery marble thrown up
by a tenderly - treated background. The com-
position is singularly happy, the coloring deli-
cate and harmonious without being feeble, and
the treatment altogether shows Mr. Streeton in
a most favorable light. His “ Cremorne Pas-
toral ” (24), too, is by no means the least successful
landscape he has painted. A stretch of hillside
for a foreground, a few straggling trees, the
waters of Sydney Harbor, and the distant heights,
are all the elements of the composition, but
the artist has treated them with consummate
skill, as they are seen under the sunless light. A
water-color drawing of “ Adelaide ” (182) is
another artistic piece of work, showing the “ City
of Churches ” in the distance, and a curious effect
of partial storm. It is in water-colors that Mr.
F. P. Mahoney has most successfully asserted him-
self this year, his “Mid-day Spell” (186), a bush
scene with bullocks resting with their load of
giant timber, being excellently handled and
it is distinctively Australian. We can call to
mind nothing better from this favorite artist’s
brush. Of his oil paintings, “The Cry of the
Mothers ” (16) will be the most popular. The
“ mothers ” prove to be mares and cows in dread of
the rising flood. The artist’s excellent drawing
is here as conspicuous as his sympathy with ani-
mal life. He likewise sends some exceedingly fine
portraits of horses, and one of a male biped. The
natural, well-studied and totally unaffected cattle
drawing of Mr. G. Lambert makes it easy to
predict a high position for this young artist.
Specially noteworthy is the painting of the chest-
nut horse, with the bridle entangled round his
hoofs, in “ A Ticklish Moment ” (42).
* * #
Mr. Sidney Long continues to make rapid pro-
gress. His principal work is “Summer” (44), a
landscape with a water-hole, executed principally
with the palette-knife. Though a trifle garish,
perhaps, in tone, it possesses considerable merit, and
is a striking picture. Mr. Hall Thorpe is another
rising artist, whose future should be assured if he
will somewhat curb his ambition for a time. His
rather startling “Fairy Bower, Manly ” (81), has
considerable merit, however, though we prefer the
less pretentious and very artistic little “View of
Bronte” (23). Miss Ethel Stephens is seen to
excellent advantage in her “Portrait of Mrs.
Julius Caro’* (96), handled with rare delicacy and
much force. Mr. J. S. Watkins is a liberal con-
tributor ; his “Harmony in Grey” (7), a head of
a dark-eyed girl, being among his best produc-
tions. Mr. D. G. Reid is most favorably seen
in his somewhat poetic “ Where the Bracken
Rusted ” (90) (more “ bracken ! ”), and Miss Emily
Meston in a most telling portrait (the strongest
portrait, so far as The Bulletin knows, yet
painted in Australia by a woman) of the
Rev, G. MTnnes (25), and an exceptionally
fine “ Study of Grapes ” (54). Miss Emily
L. Paul has a good genre subject, “ On the Shelf ”
87), and Mr. W. E. Chambers sends a portrait of
Mr. James Spencer (101). Mr. W. A. Moir’s
“Boundary Rider” (86) possesses merit, but is
unequal; and Mr. Sidney Cocks shows some very
artistic water-colors. Out of the few examples of
plastic art, the ruggedly powerful bust of an
“ Aboriginal Warrior Chief ” (214), by Mr.
Nelson Illingworth, should be noted ; while among
the “Black and White ” and the architectural
and decorative drawings and designs will be
found several subjects well deserving attention.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
Zimmerman has arrived at Adelaide per Oruba,
and intends slaying there for some months for strict
training. He will then visit Melbourne and Sydney. He
says he has made no engagements, neither will he issue
immediately a challenge, but he is prepared to race any-
body or everybody. He intends to give up cycling pro-
fessionally after his tour here.
* ♦ * ♦
Zimmerman was 26 on June 11. He began his
athletic career in jumping contests ; it was not till ’B9 that
he first figured in cycling. In ’9O he beat W. VV. Windle,
theretofore invincible, and closed ’9l with 52 firsts, 10
seconds, 3 thirds—many world’s records. In ’92’s spring
he made all the English cyclists wish him dead. He
didn’t do well at first, but when started he fairly ran
over them. ’92 closed with 100 races ; 75 firsts. 10 seconds,
5 thirds. In ’93 he scored 101 firsts out of 111 races. In
’95 lie got married, and is now in the business, and while
in all probability he is still boss cyclist, he is boss cycle-
advertiser.
• « • •
Zimmerman says that a cyclist whose best un-
paced mile record is 2.20 can be pulled through in 2min.
with a pace-maker.
• » * *
Zimmerman attributes his ability to “stay”
during the cycling season to his never getting astride his
machine in the winter time : “The men who train all the
winter generally go slale before the fall.” To this prac-
tice Megson, Lewis, and co., of Australia, offer a big con-
trast ; they are always cycling. “Build up the reserve
force,” says Zim.
* * • ♦
Zimmerman says the hardest race is the quar-
ter-mile. It is a struggle from start to finish, and
exhausts him more than a mile or two miles where a man
is gradually worked up to the final sprint.
» ♦ » *
When the season is beginning Zimmerman gets
upon a road-machine and starts with 10 miles a day.
Slowly he gets up to 30, and all the time he lets the
scorcher pass him on the road. He considers hand-
rubbing the most refreshing and valuable part of training.
* * * •
Since ’B7 Zimmerman has won 400 prizes, includ-
ing 10 pianos, 4 horses, 8 carriages, 25 gold watches, [3
building lots, 40 diamonds, 100 medals, and stacks of
silver plate. He says cement tracks are the best for
speed. He is Oft. high, weighs 1701 b., rides a “bike”
weighing only 191 b., eats plenty of meat when training
but bars potatoes and cucumbers, and says racing has
been good for his health.

Edison’s latest invention is a clockwork bicycle-
propeller, so arranged that, going uphill, it does practi-
cally all the work, whereas going downhill or on level
ground, it winds itself up automatically.
* * * *
Megson, N.S.W. champion cyclist, like Wat-
son, the English mile and five-miles champion, is only 22
years old -four years younger than Zimmerman. All the
same, Zim. is really no older than Megson, and has four
years’ more experience.

Why is football on the down-grade in Melb. ?
asks the chuckle-headed barracker. The wonder is that
the game ever got to its dizzy height of, say, five years
ago. Cricket, as an entertainment for the intelligent
public, is kept alive by the exceptional skill of compara-
tively few players. But at football one strong and active
low-browed ruffian is much the same as another. Mel-
bourne alone turns out about 240 kicking stars, half of
that number being classed Hay I. The average man is
tired of hearing of wonderful Billies, Macs, Micks,
Hughies, &0., &c. He has lost interest in the identities
of these heroes, because the strain of trying to spot them
in the field was softening his brain. The decline of Melb.
football dates back to the season when the local Herald
started to publish tbe photos, of about half-a-dozen
“ leading ” players every blessed week. They were too
numerous, and too unprepossessing in appearance to seem
worth any more idolatry.
• * * *
Prior Vaughan has been lamenting, at Charters
Towers, the condition of the English masses. “Thirty
per cent, only of the people of Great Britain attend
church.” And the men of the Towers listen sympathis-
ingly to the Prior's tale of woe and then adjourn to their
regular Sunday afternoon worship on the football ground.
It would take a smart missionary to round up 30 percent,
of the Towers population to a place of worship.
• * • *
After a recent Melb. football-match the winning
team sought refuge in the pavilion, and remained there
until escorted home by a body of police followed by a
howling mob. The noble game!
♦ * ♦ *
Victorian Rugby players (writes a correspon-
dent) had a rough time of it after their match against
N.S.W. Combined. Nearly every man who got a scratch
suffered from blood-poisoning, and as scratches were
numerous, about half the team were more or less dis-
abled ;in fact, some of them are not yet better. Several
of the Sydney men were also affected. It is said the
trouble was caused by certain chemicals in the artificial
manures used in “ top-dressing ” the ground.

Suggested in England that the 1896 Australian
team should be managed by the Marylebone Club, “ thus
removing the objectionable gate-money element invari-
ably associated with Australian teams in England."
“Objectionable!” Hum! No more gate-money, no
more Australee-man play. No more rum, no more blanky
hallelujah !

Sydney cricket-season began last Saturday by
A. Bannerman scoring a duck’s egg and many smaller
lights following his example. University made the lowest
score, viz., 30, including 2 sundries ; Colreavy, with 11,
being the only double-figure scorer. The highest com-
pleted score was the Glebe's (M’Kibbin’s) club with 88.
The highest scorer of all Saturday’s players was M’Kibbin
with 23; he also bagged 3 wickets for 6. Only threeuther
batsmen reached 20, viz., Turner, Brewster and Driver.
Turner, bowling with no luck as usual, got 3 of the Uni.’s
for 18 ; while shea, his fellow bowler, got 5 for 10. S. P.
Jones obtained 5 wickets for 32, and Newell 3 for 5.

Stoddart’s team benefited Melb. O.C. by over
£3900. The M.C.C. members now number 2908, which is
the record, and 239 above last year’s roll. The club’s
total net receipts for last year were £10,000; entrance-
fees and subscriptions came to £623s—an excess of £965
over last year’s total.
♦ * * *
W. G. Grace admits that he is not so much at
home with very fast bowling as he used to be. His eye-
sight has lost some of its alertness, and Richardson’s
express ones have a trick of getting past him before he
knows where ’e are. Now, an elderly commercial gent
will swear that his eyes are as good as ever they were in
his life.
* * * *
A few days ago the cricket-season opened at a
N.S.W. hospital for the insane, and while two patients were
batting, a third brought off a magnificent catch. His
own surprise, coupled with the hearty, if incoherent,
applause of bis audience, put him fairly off his head, and
he cleared off over the fence, taking the ball with him.
All qualified to do so at once gave chase, but it took them
half-an-hour to “ find the ball ’’—three or four miles away
in the bush. Meanwhile the men at the wickets had
compiled 278 runs. Which recalls the remark of the
Frenchman who caught a passing glimpse of a Rugby
football match: “It was wrong of him to steal ze ball,
but zey should not have executed him on ze spot.”

In Melbourne, “ progressive euchre,’’ with its
expensive prizes, has become so great a tax that in many
circles players limit their liabilities by paying so much
per head into the pool at the beginning of the season, the
money going to purchase the trophies.

Surrey seems to be rich in bowlers since
Lohmann returned to work. Tall Richardson stood out
of the team when they played Essex, the other week, but
the gap was filled by Smith, anew man, who took 10
wickets for 50 runs.

Walter Giffen, like Jack Lyons, is now a share-
broker in Adelaide.
In the international amateur athletic competi-
tions at New York, held in very hot weather, the mem-
bers of the N.Y. Club won every event from the British
representatives. The following records were made:—•
830 Yards Championship.—lmin. 53 2-sseo. ; previous re-
cord, F. J. K. Cross, Oxford, Imin. 54 2-ssec. 220 Yards.—

America, in 1892. 120 Yards Hurdle Race.—ls 3-ssec. ;
previous record, 0. G. Williams, New York, 1891, 15

“What is to prevent bookmakers standing beside
the tote and offering machine odds and a shade over?”
In Maoriland, the police. Or they try to. A punter
wishing to invest 10s. and not knowing anybody trust-
worthy enough, or willing to trust him, as a partner in a
£1 tote-lioket, has to sneak round to the back of the
scraping-sheds and hand his money and initials to an
individual who is carefully dressed to look unlike a book-
maker. This man, or boy, furtively looks over his
shoulder every now and then and asks the punter to “Get
away quick, please.” The wagers are, at convenient
intervals, booked by another furtive-looking chap on an
ordinary race-card. In the towns nearly all the betting is
done on the street, the “book” considering it safer to
risk pneumonia by standing out in the wet surreptitiously
laying the odds, than to have detectives poking into his
office to put a bit on.

Tote v. Bookie. At the recent S.A.J.C. spring
meeting the Derby candidate, Auraria, paid 30s. on the
tote. The bookies declined to accept tote commissions,
“No money Auraria” being theory. Showing what a
nice chance the public would have had to get on at 6 to 4

Estimated that Robinson and party, now shoot-
ing buffaloes on Melville Island, have killed 1500 beasts
since their hunt began ; also that, since ’B6, 30,000 buf-
faloes have been slain altogether on island and mainland.
Obviously, it is only a question of time till the species is
exterminated altogether.

Novel tennis point. In a recent ladies’ tourna-
ment the hair of one lady came down, so the umpire
allowed her to retire to do it up. She stayed away Ihr,

down will just have to play with it down, or default.

The late Alec Robertson would never tell a
friend what horse to back. He’d say “Give me your
money and I will put it on for you.” To a particular
friend, who questioned him, he replied: “Well, I
wouldn’t like to tell a hundred lies every day, and it isn’t
good enough to publish one’s knowledge regarding a
particular horse, so I make a rule never to tip anything
for anybody.”

Jockey Jim Hayes, who has at last persuaded
the V.R.C. to reinstate him, rode the first win of his
new era at Flemington last Saturday. He bestrode
Hova, and won a good race from a good horse, Wallace.
Hova, though not favorite, was pretty well backed, and
the public cheered Hayes greatly. Hayes having had
plenty of time for reflection, it should take much success
to turn his head now.

Caulfield last Saturday, Wallace must have a big show in
V.R.C. Derby. He made a fine run at Hova in the last
furlong, and, although too late to catch him, showed
some of his father’s pace. This was a w.f.a. race, and
some good horses finished behind which didn’t figure to
any extent in the betting.
* ♦ * •
By running Hova so close a race at w.f.a. in the
Sept. Stakes (1J miles) at Caulfield, Wallace shows he has
retained his two-year-old form. The distance was out
out in 2min. 9|sec., and as such recent winners as Bruin
and Eiridsforde were behind the leading couple, the per-
formance may be looked on as good. Whoever draws
Wallace in the big sweep should draw the winner of the
V.R.C. Derby.
* ♦ « *
The Maorilanders’ version is that, of those who
finished behind the first three, in the Sept. Handicap,
The Possible will probably prove to be the best at Flem-
ington, by which time he will be fit. They say people
haven’t seen the best of Maxim’s three-quarter brother.
* • * ♦
If Mr. Hordern trusts Vivian in V.R.C. Derby
that horse should secure a place, though he cannot beat
either Wallace or Challenger.
♦ ♦ *
Common, looking in splendid condition, was
served up hot for the Seeholme Stakes at Randwick, on
Saturday, but he performed ingloriously. He has since
gone to Melb., and, as a mile is his best distance, he may
run forward next Saturday at Caulfield in the Toorak
Handicap, in which he is well-treated with Bst. 71b.
» * * »
The Ballarat sports are standing the double
Idolater and Dreamland. A good combination, as, bar
accidents, backers may be assured of a run in both
instances.
* * * ♦
Tote-bettors make their own odds. Two horses
made a dead-heat of it in a race at Auckland (M.L.), the
other day. The favorite paid 16s. for the pound invested,
and the outsider £139 10s.
* * * *
Why don’t the racing authorities exercise more
control over the naming of racehorses? They allow more
than one horse of the same name to run in the same
event, as witness Pile’s Carlton and Hale’s ditto, which
were racing against each other in Adelaide recently.
Besides, no horse with a name bearing a marked similarity
to another should be registered. For instance, we see
Malula, Maluma, and Maluna all in the same race, and
Marusa a stable mate of Maruma. This is grossly unfair
to the public.
* * • ♦
People who have read many Maorilanders’
assertions that St. Hippo is as good as Carbine, expected
a revelation as to the true form of this heavily-weighted
horse at Flemington, but a cracked hoof has upset his
party’s arrangements. However, he may yet be well
enough to don silk. Carbine had a cracked hoof before
he won the Cup.
* ♦ ♦ ♦
St. Hippo, top weight in Toorak Handicap, and
Caulfield, Melb., and N.Z. Cups, hasn’t won a race for
two years, and a couple of his first get at the stud have
just popped into existence in M.L.
* * * *
N.S.W. will be strongly represented in the
coming Vic. campaign. In addition to the much-belauded
Hopscotch (who may turn out a flash-in-the-pan, like
Brockleigh), Mahee, Solanum and Alcmena may be ex-
pected to run well in Caulfield Cup, whilst it will take a
good horse to put down Delaware in Melb. Cup. The
wins of Georgio and Oxide at Randwick last Saturday
considerably enhance his form, as he gave Georgio two
stone and a beating in the Craven Plate, and is credited
with being “ tons ” better than his stable-mate, Oxide.
Mahee, Alcmena and Toreador should also show pro-
minently, the latter especially deserving a tick against
his name.
♦ ♦ ♦ *
It is the opinion of at least one shrewd Rand-
wick racing-man that before Melb. Cup flag falls there
will be a preponderance of N.S.W. money pn Mahee.
* * * *
It is now almost a certainty that Bob Ray will
be absent from the Vic. garland competition, his swollen
knee rendering further training impossible at present.
By the way, his owner, always fortunate in horsey bar-
gains, experienced a gleam of consolation on Saturday
when Havanna, bought for 175 guineas the previous
week, scored in the hurdles at Randwick.
* * « •
Noted that the Admiral is an absentee from the
Caulfield Stakes ; but owner Cook is represented by the
Merry Boy and the Heroine.
* ♦ ♦ ♦
Taranaki’s last in the Sept. Handicap on Satur-
day isn’t a good augury for the future, but it may not be
worth anything, especially as he carriedß.il. His Cup
imposts are considerably less.
• • ♦ *
Armilla, by Castor—Necklace, is reckoned fast
enough to be sent from M.L. to contest Maribyrnong
Plate, which her sister, Necklet, won a few yean ago.

DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENTS
Mr. Steel is undertaking his DISCRETIONARY IN-

taken EVERY SATURDAY over the CURRENT
Races ROUND MELBOURNE, for clients who cannot
themselves attend, by Mr. A. W. STEEL (member of

WINNERS, and has the pleasure of sending them
WINNING CHEQUES.

MENTS.

MENTION this paper.
I IMPORTANT CAUTION.
Please to observe that Mr. Steel is the only AC-
CREDITED PUBLIC INVESTOR in Melbourne, so
BEWARE of people who might WRITE you (not
having the MEANS to advertise), professing to under-
take DISCRETIONARY IN VESTMENTS, or express-
ing their desire to BACK CERTAIN HORSES for you.
ANY persons from here who WRITE you, or send
you price-lists, circulars, etc., making such offers, you
may put down as “Impostors,” if their advertisements do
not appear in THIS and OTHER respectable journals.
SPECIAL WARNING 1—These “parasites” are
AGAIN “in the field” JUST NOW, sending circulars to
the unwary, advising them to back certain horses
THROUGH THEM for the CAULFIELD UUP, etc., and,
of course, offering SEVERAL POINTS above the LEGITI-
MATE odds!
Mr. Steel begs to THANK those of his clients who have
made him aware of these facts, and sent him the “Bogus”
Vouchers which these individuals endeavoured to FORCE
on them with their letters.

In Melb. Cup of ’65 the grey pony, Tory Boy,
beat the 1500-guinea imported horse, Panic. Yet a few
years afterwards the grey was sold at Kirk’s for 15 guineas
as a hack—and a small gold-mine could not have bought
Panic.

The luok of horse-racing. Two days before
Zulu’s Cup, the trainer wired to owner : “ Horse lame
and off feed. Shall I scratch him ? ” The answer came
back : “ No, give him a run.” And the lame fraud, at a
100 to 1 chance, left behind him such good ones as Dare-
bin, Sweetmeat, and Savanaka—and was never heard of
afterwards.

When Tom Hales first thought of setting up a
stud, he much fancied Lochiel, but a Melb. vet. pro-
nounced the horse to be saturated with disease. Looking
at recent performances in N.S.W. of Lnohiel’s two-year-
old progeny, Tom tears his hair and howls for that vet.’s
blood.

path. W. Newcombe, jun., is ready to back Tom Lloyd
up to £100 to ride a three-horses-raatch to be decided by

wager and the championship.
Now, when an owner, trainer or jock is brought
up to show why his neddy did not win (when the stewards
had backed it), Ikey Mo and Co. come forward with their
books to prove that the stable had backed the animal
heavily. Dummy bets, of course.

Piles Cured. — Owing to the fact that numbers
of people think piles are incurable, the proprietor
of the new “ Cannalin ” remedies has given in-
structions that free samples and descriptive
pamphlets are to be sent to all applicants in the
colonies. Those who have obtained no relief,
even after years of treatment or from operation,
are specially invited to write to the dep6t for
Australasia, 257 George-st., Sydney, N.S.W.*
How is that bogus enquiry into the state
of Smellbourne’s unpaid magistracy getting on ?
Unpaid, in this connection, is good.
Louis Pasteur, who died last week, aged
73, rendered splendid service to science and
humanity. He made the grand generalisation
that disease is due to the presence of living organ-
isms, and experimentally showed how —as in
hydrophobia—the body may be immunised and
defended against their attacks. All the recent
discoveries of serums antagonistic to cholera, or
diphtheria, or snake-poison, have their root in the
laboratory of the famous French chemist.
“ There are lots of people very anxious to
save this motion against Judge Windeyer from
coining on. Let it come on and be dealt with on
its merits. But if there is any more dirt thrown
about by the head of the Department of Justice
in this province, let me tell him that, whatever
the consequences, and whatever the results may
be to me, I shall speak out in the matter and
make him wish to God he had kept his mouth
quiet.”—W. P. Crick, M.P., in N.S.W. As-
sembly.
“Jim” Toohey, of the big Sydney brewing
firm of J. T. and J. M. Toohey, whose death in
England is cabled, left N.S.W. a few months ago
on a holiday trip. He was about 46 years old,
and a native of Victoria, but up to the very day of
his departure from Sydney he was a wild Irish
boy. He was a good-hearted fellow of many
friends and many parts, and had dabbled more or
less successfully in politics, the drama, sport and
business. For over 10 years he was an active
member of N.S.W, Legislative Assembly, and in
five Parliaments sat for South Sydney. He was a
strong Protectionist, and freely spent both money
and personal energy in advancing Australian
nationalistic principles. His last public escapade,
labelled by himself “Go I to Tamworth” {to
oppose G. Republican Dibbs, who had politically
offended him) will be fresh in the memory of Corn-
stalks!
END’S “FRUIT SALT.” —An M.D. (Edinb.
and M.R.O.S., L.A.C. (London), writes:—“ I am
much pleased with your ‘FRUIT SALT/ having
tried it on myself. Your theory and remarks are
most reasonable. Having nearly died of typhoid
when studying at college, being the only one out
of 16 who recovered, I mean to go in well for
purifying the blood. Though I am 63, I have not
the least doubt it will be very serviceable to me.”

Next Monday is Eight-Hour Day, and the
Demonstration Committee has completed every
possible arrangement necessary to the Success of
the celebration. Enormous numbers of tickets
have already been sold, the splendid exhibition of
art-union prizes in Priddy’s old shop, 438 George-
st., having proved a capital advertisement. The
association football-match between Balmain and
Pyrmont Rangers should prove a great attraction,
while the day will be suitably wound up by
T. A. Kennedy’s marvellous hypnotic enter-
tainment in the Town Hall at night. There
are 12 entries for the band-contest, including all
the regimental bands, so that the music for the
procession should be first-class. Monday has
been declared a general holiday within the county
of Cumberland,*
Attorney-General Want says that Salo-
mons’s statement re the Dean case is backed up by
“ other facts that have come into his possession,”
but which, up to the time of writing, he hadn’t
disclosed. This is a (S.M. Herald copyright)
“ reprehensible ” and one-sided mode of argument.
The “facts” which J. Want thinks he is in
possession of might possibly be demolished by the
other side and proved to be mere wind, if only
they were disclosed. But so long as they are not
disclosed they can’t be refuted, and so Want hits his
opponent without giving him a chance to hit back.
The Attorney-General should have said nothing
about this information until he was in a position
to reveal it. ___

GEO. BAUMANN - Proprietor
(Caterer hy appointment lu the GovernorJ,
“Is there any necessity for me to live
with the woman ? ” asked a wife-beater of Mr,
Keogh, P.M., at' Eitzroy, the other morning.
“Not for the ensuing quarter, at any rate,”
promptly replied Mr. Keogh, as ho gave him three
months’ hard.
Dr. Syme, of Melb. Hospital, on the
curious and anomalous laws of human heredity:—
It is apparently more common for qualities to be trans-
mitted from the female, and especially to the male off-
spring ; while it is also common for qualities to be trans-
mitted from the male parent to the female offspring. So
that if this rule held good for two generations the males
would resemble their maternal grandfather, and the
females their paternal grandmother. Of course in very
many cases the transmission is from male parent to male
offspring ; but the first rule is certainly very common, and
helps to explain why genius need not be hereditary, and
why the sons of great men so seldom attain distinction.
Dear Bulletin, —Among the reforms re-
commended by certain fossils in high places to
spoil the business of the abortionist no allusion
was made to the only effective remedy—the
legitimisation of children born out of wedlock.
The so-called illegitimacy of the child, and the
consequent disgrace to the mother, are the chief
incentives to women to “ hide their shame,” even
at the risk of their lives. Strange that the birth
of a child, the greatest good a woman can do the
world, should, under any circumstances, be
accounted her “shame!” When all children are
legitimate, and every mother a wife by the fact of
the birth of her child, illegal operations, baby-
farming and infanticide will vanish. Doubtless
the parson-flock will hold up hands of pious horror
at such an idea, and prate of the “ sacredness of
marriage.” They do not mean marriage, but the
legal and religious form which adds importance to
their cloth, puts power in their hands—and cash in
their pockets. Away with long-dead but unburied
superstitions, and let us compile a marriage-law
bused on humanity and justice.— Wakea.
Bulletin correspondents (writes one of
them) have been disputing over the relative
measures of honor which belong to the pioneers of
the Broken Hill mines. But for the last seven
years I have not seen in print, nor have I heard
spoken, the name of the man who really was the
pioneer of the N.S.W. silver-mining industry;
indeed, the honor has been absolutely taken from
him and given to others. His name was Charles
Nickle, and his last public appearance, so far as I
know, was at a banquet tendered to W. R.
Wilson (he of St. Alban’s) upon his retiring from
the general managership of the Barrier Ranges
Silver Mining Association. In ’75, Nickle worked
a lead “ show ” at Thackariuga, laboriously got a
waggon-load of the galena ore down to the sea-
board, and shipped it. The vessel foundered !
He afterwards sent away a second lot, but this
barely paid expenses, and the effort to open up
the field was practically abandoned for four years.
Then Nickle found the Clifton; the Maybell
and Maybell North followed. It was not till
after Thackariuga and Puruamoota (“The
Soakage ”) were almost famous that Charles
Rasp pegged out the Broken Hill mine;
and how much he knew about it was shown by the
fact that when he returned to Mount Gipps head
station he told them he had struck a hill full of
tin, and gave notice to leave forthwith. It is
quite true that after this George M’Culloch, then
manager of Mount Gipps, now art-connoisseur of
London (you ought to have seen—and heard!—
M’Culloeh in those days) helped the industry
along; but in the real pioneering times, when it
seemed to be a fight between miner and squatter,
M'Culloch was hostile to the prospectors. Cer-
tainly the latter did not have quite as much
respect for fences as they should have had. The
Brodribbs were at that time on Poolamacca
Station, and Mrs. Brodribb came in to spill a
bottle of champagne over the first smelting fur-
nace at Broken Hill—on May 6, 1886 (over 10
years after Nickle’s ore had gone to the bottom).
George M'Culloch presided at the banquet on
that occasion. J. S. Reid and Walter Sully have
been mentioned ; “ Randolph the Reckless ” re-
gards them as the only two “ early Broken Hill
men ” who deserve much praise—for perspicacity,
at any rate. To Reid, Broken Hill certainly
owes much: he “barracked” for it more than
any other man, and not only in his paper.
But Sully got his interests more by good luck
than good managment, and for a long wliile per-
sistently fought for Silverton (now almost deserted)
as the centre of the field, instead of Broken Hill.
So much for his part in the development of Broken
Hill ! Anyway, there isn’t much credit due to
anybody for opening up a mine like the B.H.
Proprietary, which was manifestly a payable thing
almost from the start; the credit (if it belongs to
anybody, and perhaps that is doubtful) really
belongs to the men like Nickle, McLean, the
Nolans and others who opened up Thackariuga
and Purnamoota, and the men like W. R. Wilson,
who furnished them with money to do it.
Talking of Broken Hill and those very
early days, it is noticed by old hands that hardly
any of those who roughed it then, and did not
clear out before the boom, afterwards left it with
much over a “liver” in their pockets. Apart
from the eight or ten early Broken Hill men, not
six pioneers of the Barrier kept anything to speak
of. The men who did make the money were
those who did not go there till the boom was a
certainty, knew it was only a boom, treated it as
such, were prepared for a collapse at any moment,
and, when the collapse did come, cleared. The
storekeepers, hotel-keepers, &e., who were “making
fortunes ’’—and they deserved them for what they
put up with —were almost without exception
stranded. A line for Coolgardie ?
Ladies who value a clear skin and fresh
complexion, and who appreciate the possession of
clean, white teeth and a sweet breath, should
follow the example of their European sisters and
indulge in the use of Amykos. After being out
in the hot sun, or on a dusty road, nothing is more
cooling or refreshing than a little Amykos
sprinkled in the water in which you lave your
face and mouth. One does not require to be
using it all day long, but those who have experi-
enced its benefits say that the morning ablutions
are certainly not complete without it. Purchase
a sample bottle from your chemist.*

STATUTORY DECLARATION,
I, THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-street, Sydney, in the Colony of New
South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows : Whereas I suffered severely from
a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that I was quite unable to
attend to my business. I tried several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as
a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “Alkaline Vitality Pills,”
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare Completely Cured Me within a few weeks, and
although tiiis is over five years ago I have remained well ever since. The Alkaline Pills also
cured my wife, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true.—
THOS. MUDIMAN.
Subscribed and declared at Sydney this 23rd day of November, 1891, before me.—S. T. Whiddon,
J.P. Also witnessed by A. Baly, Esq., a Commissioner of the Supreme Court of New South
Wales and Victoria.
Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testi-
mony carries special weight, writes thus : To Herr Rassmussen.— Dear Sir, —I think it my doty to
inform you that a course of your Alfalme Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and, in consequence, I have recommended them to many friends, who have all been cured by their
use. —Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.
A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb., July 18, 1892.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention that several of my friends
to whom I have recommended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them; therefore, I consider you are deserving of success, wmcn
I do most heartily wish you.
Yours gratefully, A. HARRIS, J.P.
A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper of
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.
As witness: John Hagerman (my husband), caretaker Tivoli
Theatre, Castlereagh-street, Sydney.
A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had t<
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfalim-
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated—
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.
A Lady’s Wish Fulfilled.
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform you that your cele-
brated Alfaline Universal Pills cured me, when all other remedies and
doctors failed, of a stubborn case of Debility of 18 years’ standing. My

gymnast last from the London Aquarium, where
for two years she was the Leading Star in her
Wonderful Double Backward Somersault from

picturesque and graceful act.
The marvellous Les Frbres ECLAIRS. Croco-
diles and Demons. The brothers must be allied
to the invertebrate tribe, for their gyrations are
most sinuous and snakelike. The elder brother’s
neck, jawbone and teeth are evidently of the pre-
historic age, the ease with which he balances him-
self in the air being little short of MIRACU-
LOUS. Such an act as this has never been seen
in Australia.
Professor PEART—Professor PEART—Pro-
fessor PEART, engaged from Imry Kiralfy’s
Indian Exhibition, Earl’s-court, London. The
Champion High Diver of the World ! The Latest
and Greatest London and American Success. He
will DIVE from the DOME of the Exhibition
Building, Melbourne, into a tank containing only
6ft. of water. From the Son, London : “ Head
foremost 150 ft. ! The latest sensational dive. Up,
up, high above the sea of faces, to a little platform
just below the glass roof, a man in the costume
of a diver is slowly being hoisted. He settles him-
self upon the scanty planking, whilst beneath him
the spectators are hushed into silent wonder at the
daring of the feat. Ah ! he springs into mid-air,
and then with theswoop of a bird upon its prey falls
rapidly to earth. Will he accomplish his self-im-
posed task in safety or will he crash into the rows of
chairs which hedge round the little tank of water
the diver has for his destination? This is the
thought which flashes simultaneously through the
mind of every spectator. An indefinable murmur
of relief runs through the gathering, for the diver
strikes the water with the velocity of an express,
throws up a cloud of spray, and then, streaming
with water, he bows his acknowledgments of the
applause which greets his successful accomplish-
ment. Twice a day does Charles Owen Peart dive
this greatest of all dives.”
The original and only Talking Horse, Mahomet,
took London by storm and became the rage. Was
performing in four music halls nightly for two
years. This is not a trick horse, but an EDU-
CATED HORSE, He adds, subtracts, divides,
multiplies, tells the time by any watch, and will
answer any questions. This is the only horse
which has been a witness in a court of justice.
The Exhibition Building in Adelaide has proved
too small to hold the enormous crowds that have
flocked in from all quarters, and the Adelaide
press have been unanimous in expressing the fact
that this is without doubt the finest show ever
seen in Adelaide. Remember this is Not a Circus,
but a Reproduction of the London Aquarium, the
Folies-Berg&res of Paris, and other Continental
Shows. General Admission—One Shilling. See
future advertisements.

i Two flamingoes and two young ostriches
were killed at Adelaide Zoo by rats, which
gnawed through their legs and then dined off their
heads. Three brood mares from a racing stud,
the owner of which did not wish their progeny to
get into other hands, were lately sent to the Zoo
to feed the carnivora, and the lions and tigers
have also eaten several racehorses killed on
Adelaide course.
Wired to a Melbourne daily :
We have hart a splendid fall of rain here. This will
have the effect of laying the dust on the roads, extin-
guishing bush fires, and causing the grass to spring.
Also, it will have the effect of making some mud,
keeping the clothes on the line from getting dry,
and making the top of the roof wet. When a big
Melbourne paper sets about publishing encyclo-
paedic information of this character it ought not
to stop half-way.
After much talk, the Melb. Board of
Works passed a law to compel its contractors to
pay a minimum wage of 6s. a day to laborers. The
law exists, but contractors simply “ take a lunar ”
at it, and the minimum wage continues to be the
lowest price at which a man will sell the labor of
his hands under the compulsion of threatened
starvation. The Board’s officers do not trouble
to discover whether the enactment is obeyed
or not, but when a glaring case of non - com-
pliance is thrust under their noses all they can
do is to deduct from moneys due to the defaulting
sweater the difference between the wage paid and
the alleged standard of 65., and pay the money
into the account of the Board—not to the unfor-
tunate laborers. So that the Board actually profits
by the extortion.

N.S.W. Judge Simpson’s decision that
drunkenness on the part of a wife isn’t legal
ground for divorce unless the lady is in a state of
habitual rum for three years, and neglects her
domestioduties for that period, is ratherastounding.
Under this precedent, the lady may be in an awful
condition of gin-and-cloves for, say, two years
and nine months. Then, if she straightens up for
six months or so, the offence isn’t legally habitual,
and she can start on another brandy-crawl for
another 2| years. Also, it appears that no
amount of drink will fill the bill unless the lady
also “neglects her domestic duties.” The Bul-
letin reads of a case in point, in the shape of a
lady who performs her domestic duties most
assiduously when she is “on her ear.” On
these frequent occasions she is possessed of
a demon of washing-up, and scrubs all the
crockery in the house until it is reduced to chaos.
She also washes the sewing-machine or the
chiffonier and sometimes the pictures as well,
though generally she falls off the chair while she
is reaching them down, and puts her foot through
them. Then she flies round vigorously to get the
dinner ready, and when the old man comes home
he finds a burnt leg of mutton deposited on the
tapestry table-cloth, and the potatoes on the floor,
and a capsized cruet somewhere else, and a pud-
ding that has been recently snatched out of the
ashes. That lady doesn’t neglect her domestic
duties ; she performs them with all her heart and
soul, and with a misdirected zeal that is more than
commendable. Where does she come in according
to Judge Simpson’s reading of the law?

“ Adulteration,” said Bright, “ is a form
competition.” The absurd Tories down South treat
the importation of shoddy as a direct result of
Victorian Protection. The English mills that
turn out tweed, as the National Wool co. testify,
with never a thread of natural wool, are the re-
sults of Victorian Protection. The English
factories that make the manufacture of “devils”
a principal branch of trade are the result of Vic-
torian Protection. The association of the town of
Brummagem with everything that is spurious is
the result of Victorian Protection. As every
advantage that accrued to England during the
past 50 years is the result of Ereetrade, so every
disaster that has accrued to Victoria during the
last five years is the result of Protection, and the
land-boom and the robbery of the people by the
banks had nothing to do with it. As all the evils
that have happened to England in 50 years are
the result of natural causes, so all the benefits
that have happened to Victoria in 25 years are the
result of natural causes and G-od Save the Queen.
A GRAND LITERARY INSTITUTION.
Cole’s Book Arcade now runs from the centre
of the block in Bourke-street to the centre of the
block in Collins-street, Molb., a distance of 660 ft.,
and contains the following 17 departments, mostly
literary and artistic : 1, New Books; 2, Second-
hand Books; 3, Stationery ; 4, Music ; 5, Fancy
Goods ; 6, Toys ; 7, Perfumery ; 8, Pictures ; 9,
Artists’ Materials ; 10, an Ornament Exhibition ;
11, a Japanese Exhibition ; 12, a Wonderland ;
13, a Smiling Gallery; 14, a Child’s Picture
Gallery ; 15, a Bargain Room ; 16, a Tea Room ;
17, a splendidly arranged new Wholesale Book
Department, containing half a million books. The
main walks of the establishment are half a mile
long. •
In N.S.W. Assembly the other night
Mr. Crick drew the attention o f the Minister for Justice
to the fact that people who went to visit prisoners at
Darlinghurst Gaol were ushered in by the public flogger,
and he asked whether the department would, in consider-
ation of the feelings of women and others visiting the
gaol, place another official on duty at the public door?
In reply, Minister Gould said that he understood the man
performing the duty alluded to was one of the gaol
warders. Of course, the public flogger might be em-
ployed in opening the door for visitors just the same
as any other warder.
When The Bulletin was in the debtors’ prison it
took some time to discover that the round-
shouldered Hercules who acted as messenger was
the flogger of the day. Queerly enough, he was a
man of strongly polemical bent, and to
agnosticism of a most robust order, his god being
Bradlaugh. He couldn’t afford to believe in a
Hell. The gentleman erot so far into the good
graces of politician Dibbs during the latter’s in-
carceration that Damchioago, when he became
Premier long afterwards, appointed him to the
governorship of a country gaol. However, the
locals refused to believe that a man-flayer was fit
to preside over any establishment for the reforma-
tion of criminals, and public opinion was so strong
on the subject that the flogger-governor had to
“get.” And worse followed. The flogger fell in
love and got into legal trouble. Then he died,
and he is now probably flogging lost souls.

cent letter. Malformations are very scarce among:
snakes in Australia or anywhere else ; the only
two-tailed snake I’ve seen (a “whip”) was at
Cootarnundra, some years ago. On the other
hand, it is quite a common thing for some specie*
of lizards to have two or more tails. Since coming
here (W. A.) I have taken a lizard with three tails,
and the Macleay Museum (at Sydney University)
has one with four. —A. M. Lea. Perth, 12/8/’DS.
Dear Bulletin, —In describing how a
S.A, Govt, official, some years ago, consulted the
Crown-Solicitor as to which countries were out-
side extradition treaties with Great Britain, and
thereupon departed with a handsome sum of
money and a lady who was not his wife —yon
missed the cream of the joke. In due course the
Crown - Solicitor in question billed the S.A.

Medical law in N.S.W., as stated by a
leading Sydney doctor: “ Business men and
lawyers are strictly protected as regards their pro-
perty and professional privileges, but they and the
general public have no protection against quack
pretenders who tamper with their lives in greedy
ignorance. Indeed the law, instead of putting
down the quack and so protecting the public,
actually encourages him. For, while a qualified
man who commits a blunder and kills a patient
by malpractice, can be punished as a criminal,
because, being supposed to know his business, he
should have done better, the quack, not knowing
his business, can plead that he did his best, and
so lead to the Judge pointing out to the jury that
the quack, having done his best according to his
ignorant ability, is therefore entitled to a verdict
of ‘Not Guilty.’ ”
The only known cure for influenza is Cole-

Editor Bulletin, —Much has been said in
Vic. Parliament and press against the imposition
of a duty on penny imported literature; one chief
argument being that it would deprive the poor
factory-girl of her novelette. As one who has had
considerable experience in the business, I may
state that the “ poor factory-girl ” is not a voraci-
ous reader of this sort of thing. Domestics are
frequent buyers of novelettes, etc,; but, in many
cases, they are for “ the missus.” The real, solid
supporter of the “penny dreadful ” is the mature
materfamilias, who, having outlived her own
romance (if she ever had one), takes a most
absorbing interest in that of the curly-haired
duke with the long legs, the persecuted heroine
with the impossible waist and feet, and the be-
diamonded marchioness; whereas the factory-
girl, and the domestic when her day’s work is done,
take their romance neat in the Fitzroy Gardens
or at the back-gate, and do not hunger for the
diluted yum-yum of the penny periodical.—

Every man possessed of any small rem-

men to know what they can do until they own a

them find out what they can’t do; but that is
nearly always because they get hold of a bad in-
strument or the wrong end of a good one, Baker

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ THBBB CASTLES 77 and “ CAPSTAN.”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“Three Castles” and “Capstan.” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

Various Verses .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN AMOROUS YOUTH.
DAS WEISS ICH SCHON.
Forth from what realms of earlier existence
Com’st thou to me ?
Claimed by what irresistible persistence
Yield I to thee ?
Surging from deeps unplumbed by recollection
Swims into ken
Thy soul that erst hath held me in subjection—
But where ? but when ?
All has been said, been thought, been done, ex-
plained
Ages ago.
Only the quintessence of love remained
For us to know.
Therefore it was that while I sat beside thee
I touched no hand.
What need for word, for touch, for kiss to guide
thee ?
We understand.
A CONTRAST.
Matched with this fiery flame wherein I burn,
How cool, my mountain love, your milder mood!
Like morning dew upon the upland fern,
Or first shy leaflets in a vernal wood,
Or like that moonlight eve we spent at Chur
Along the margin of your wild Plessur.
Here in the torrid zone of this embrace,
Sun-smitten by these dark and daring eyes,
When all is ardent fire that fills the place
Beside me, where this radiant body lies,
How faint, how rare, how delicately sweet
Those airs that reach me from your mountain seat!
O, mountain love, dear dayspring on a lawn !
O, fiery mid-day love on the lagoon !
Which is more dear, first flushings of the dawn
Or dazzling splendor of the sun at noon?
Why should I question ? Neither love is loth
Enough for me if I suffice for both.
OUR SECRET.
We have a little secret, love,
A way to say “ Good-night,”
When night
Is anything but good or right.
I in my chamber, just above
Your chamber-roof —one—two—
Throw down my boots, and so do you ;
And thus we say good-night
When night
Is anything but good or right.
ADIEU.
Well! it has come, the hour for you to go,
Your coach-wheels bear you down the dusty
way :
You pass from hence, and yet I know you know
That both our lives are altered from to-day.
What though I never held you, never felt
Your arms about me, never spelt
All through Love’s lovely alphabet,
Yet, dearest, yet
For you and me while time shall run,
While seasons last, while burns the sun,
That shall not end which is begun :
Love’s star once risen cannot set.
Nay I though I touched your shoulder only once,
Once held your hand, nor pressed it tight,
Once felt your breath upon my cheek, and once
Under the starlight said “ Good-night ”
That is enough between us two :
We made a lovers’ sacrament :
You go from hence, it is too true,
But never more, from me to you,
Be said, “Adieu, sweetheart, adieu.”
Venice.

TERPSICHORE. —A FRAGMENT.
The music did not play to her,
She made the music with her feet!
And though I could not hear their stir
I felt the players caught their beat
And took her time of dancing rhyme,
And made their playing to its chime
Like echoings.
She seemed to swim in harmonies,
And floated in her self-made airs
As a ship rippling summer seas
Makes movement music unawares ;
Or, like the maids from sea-green glades
Whose swimming sounds like serenades
To barques becalmed.
Those tuneful, tireless, tempting feet!
Ah, had they eyes ? that only when
Her petticoats were indiscreet
They peeped a moment at the men.
Or had they ears ? and heard the cheers
Of silent hearts, that full of fears
They shunned the light.

A Splendid Year for Corn .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Corn ! Dad had never seen anything like
it. Ten feet high, and the cobs full and as long
as your arm.
No one but old Tom Anderson had ever known
a better season. The first year he started was a
much better one, so he used to say. Most of the
cobs grown on his farm that year were too large
to be put through the corn-sheller, and from a
single stalk he pulled 12 of the finest cobs he ever
saw, and threshed a bushel of beautiful corn from
the tassel, which he kept for seed.
• • •
It was the healthiest-looking crop we had
had. Dad was elated, and no wonder, for he had
sworn and sweated a great deal over it, keeping
cattle off, heeling it up and cutting suckers.
But the ’possums commenced to play the devil
with it, so Dad gave a whip that Joe found to
Jimmy Anderson for some powder and shot, and
Dave made a trap out of the gin-case that mother
used to keep the clothes in. It was a well-made
trap, too, so Dad said, and was the very thing for
catching ’possums with.
Dave set it on the edge of the corn, near the lane.
The first night it didn’t catch any. Dave shifted
it. The second night—none again. The third
night one of the Maloneys shifted it. Joe saw it
at their place a long while after with rockers on
it, and a red-headed kid in it propped up with a
pillow.
* • •
Dad had no idea we would get the quantity
we did from eight acres the old bark barn
could only hold a little more than half, and so
we put a few dray-loads into the back room, and
we boys had to crawl over a heap of cobs every
night to get to bed. Pleasant! it was pleasant!
And what a pile of husks there was around the
back-door when we starting husking ! I remem-
ber mother made new pillows and refilled the bed-
ticks that year—and how we used to enjoy a rest
on the fresh husks !
Each of us did a share of the husking, and did
it at night. God knows we would be tired enough
at the end of those days, but the husking had to
be done and we couldn’t afford to do it in day-
time.
• * •
We borrowed Anderson’s corn-sheller—a
toothless old machine that only half-shelled the
cobs—the other half we did with our hands.
* * #
Dan carted the corn to the railway-station.
He liked going there, and always waited to see
the train come in. The porter said he hoped we
hadn’t much, as he was sick of throwing corn
about —everyone was carting corn, according to
him, until the shed was full of the blessed stuff.
# # #
Old Anderson and Dad were talking to-
gether at the slip-rails. Anderson was looking
for his cows and was on horseback. The youngster

Dear Bulletin, —Travelling from Cunna-
mulla to Charleville, recently, 1 met a mob of
travelling sheep. On one of the “wings ” was a
horseman with whom I had a little talk. During
our yarn he extracted a large sling from his
pocket, fitted it with a stone from the saddle-bag
and aimed the missile in the direction of a few
stragglers. The effect was to instantly round up
the wing. He told me that the boss forbade dogs
in working the sheep, and this was a labor-saving
invention of his owm. Certainly an original idea.

Dear Bulletin, — I notice that Tozer con-
gratulates Kanakaland on the decrease of leprosy.
A few facts : A man recently treated in Norman-
ton hospital for syphilitic paralysis of the hand
and mysterious leg-sores of the same nature was
discharged, and subsequently sent to Dunwich.
On arrival there he was pronounced a leper, and
duly isolated. After the man left the hospital,
and before he was removed to Dunwich, he took
possession of an empty house on the cricket-
ground, in which he camped for a month during
the ’95 flood. This house was afterwards used as
a dressing-room during the ,annual cricket-match
between Normanton and Croydon, and it is every
day used as a playhouse by the children of the
neighborhood. No attempt has been made to
disinfect either the house or the hospital. In the
early part of July the local medical officer officially
reported to the P.M. the existence of two
aboriginal lepers in the blacks’ camp (I hear there
are five). The camp is on the town lagoon, within
400 yards of the post-office. It is believed that
this report was transmitted to the Col. Sec.
(Tozer aforesaid), but up to date no action
has been taken by Govt. There are in the
camp altogether 200 blacks ; all invade the town
every morning looking for tucker and doing odd
jobs in return. You will see them in the stores
picking potatoes and onions; at private houses
they carry water from the public wells (and I
have heard they carry it from the well in the
school-yard); they nurse children, peel potatoes,
and perforin all sorts of domestic duties. What
will the harvest be ?— Consanguineous. Nor-
manton, 25/8/’95.
The usual weekly leper has been “ dis-
covered ” in the northern province—this time a
Chinaman (married). It’s the Kanaka’s turn next
week.
“Banjo’s” forthcoming volume will be
entitled “ The Man from Snowy River and Other
Verses.” It will be a handsome book, and the
price will be ss. The original edition (which will
include some verses hitherto unprinted) will con-
sist of one thousand copies only. Post-free from
Bulletin office, ss. 6d.
Nearly all the Kanaka murderers hail
from the one island—Malayta. It would pay
Boodlewraith to buy up the Malayta heathen
and pack them back to their own dear little
island. Certain humanitarians in the North
object to disarming the Polynesian, as he would
then be unable to protect himself against his homi-
cidal brethren.
Picture of the kangaroo —
from a recently-published Eng-
lish dictionary. The kangaroo,
it will be observed, carries his
tail between his legs. The
picture was evidently drawn
just after the last series of
test-cricket-matches.
Pulsford, M.L.C., says
that N.S. W. Councillors should
be appointed for eight or ten
years, and that the House
should consist of 60 members,
ten being appointed yearly. Pulsford apparently
thinks that eight or ten times ten are 60.
Dear Bulletin, —In a recent issue refer-
ence is made to the occupation of Flogger as being
“ the meanest of all vocations.” Socially speak-
ing, doubtless this is true; but, pecuniarily
considered, the emoluments attached to it tend to
make the position almost an enviable one,
especially in the eyes of retired marines. For
instance, the Flogger at Darlinghurst ranks as a
senior warder, at 9s. 3d. per diem (Sundays
included), occupies superior quarters at the gaol,
has a prisoner-servant allowed him, and is pro-
vided with fuel, light, brushware, soap, matting,
and other conveniences ; has all washing, ironing,
and mangling done gratis for himself and family.
His travelling allowance amounts to 7s. 6d. per
day when on “ detached duty.” In addition he is
in receipt of a navy pension of 2s. per day.
Twenty years ago the pay of a “Scourger” in
N.S. W. was 2s. 6d. per day, minus emoluments. —
An Ex-Warder.
What the Argus calls “an interesting and
thoughtful paper ” was recently inflicted on Melb.
Reform Club by Dr. Jamieson —the inevitable
Madden in the chair. Gist of the Jamiesonian
deliverance :
Lunatics and criminals were unfit for the franchise, and
why should not the wholly uneducated, or the man with
no fixed residence, the shiftless, the improvident, be also
considered unfit?
Interesting and thoughtful, but not exhaustive.
Why should not the enormously wealthy man
with seventeen fixed residences, and the penurious
and usurious grabster, and the wheezy man with
fatty degeneration of the heart and a bad supply
of blood to his brain, be also considered unfit?
If Dr. Jamieson is to be considered fit because he
has a “fixed residence,” why not an oyster? It
all comes back to Benjamin Franklin’s illustrative
story re property-franchise ; “In the morning
Smith owned an ass, and being a man of property
he had a vote. In the evening the ass died, and
then Smith had no vote. Therefore, it was the
ass, not Smith, which really owned the vote.”
How, in face of that story, they ever dared to
found the National Ass, is a mystery.

The Trucker’s Dream.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I had a divil av a drame last night,” said Bart
O’Brien, as he crowded his usual two-pound
plaster ” of cold fried bacon and bread into his
crib-bag.
Drame,’ d’ye call it ? ” muttered Brown from
his bunk. “ I thought you had the fantods ; you
howled like a madman.”
“Be Hiven, I don’t wonder thin. I thought I
was pumpin’ away in the place below there, whin
thim two sets at the bottom av the incline came
away, an’ I saw Georgie Lane crushed under
thim. His dead face was starin’ out av the heap
at me, all battered an’ bloody, an’ ghost-like in
the candle-light. Faith, an’ I ain’t much amused
wid these lone shifts ! ”
The boys grinned at O’Brien’s fears, but Glee-
son muttered something about the manager being
“ and -d well hanged ” for not giving an eye to
that timber, and Gleeson was considered an
authority.
Bartholomew O’Brien was a Burrgaree native.
In Bungaree the natives are more Milesian than
the Irish. Bart had for Father Cassidy a great,
childlike veneration that the ribald stories of His
Reverence’s illicit amours, told by his sceptical
hut-mates, could not shake ; and his belief in the
wonders and mysteries of his religion and the folk-
lore of his mother’s country was profound. Bar-
tholomew had also ruddy cheeks, and an unreli-
able heart.
. It was Sunday evening, hot and thirst-provok-
ing. His mates were lounging about in their
trousers on the tumbled bunks, but O’Brien was
due on the plat at nine o’clock, and was dressed
in his working clothes. He was a truoker at the
Hand-in-Hand, and it was his turn to go below
into the deserted mine, and pump the water over
the incline at the head of the main drive on the
lower level. Every Sunday night after the long
shift off this work had to be done by one of the
truckers, so that the face might be dry for the
first night-shift, coming on at one a. m. None of
the boys liked the job—O’Brien hated it. In the
presence of a tangible danger he was as game a
fellow as any in the district, but his superstition—
an ineradicable inheritance, intensified by early
influences and the teachings of a religion that
brings the emotional side of the unlettered be-
liever to an unhealthy development, and leaves to
the man the reasoning faculties of the child—
made him little more than an irresponsible idiot
when his imagination ran riot amongst the spooks
and wraiths. He had an extraordinary stock of
mottoes, religious and legendary, for warding off
the spirits, and possessed all the portable charms
the Church had for sale, but his faith was not as
powerful as his fears, and, in spite of these spiritual
arms and armour, he dreaded to be alone in the
murderous old mine, with the ghosts of its many
dead. %
On going to the bottom level that night, and
threading the course of the long, tortuous main
drive, the truoker found the water below the
incline higher than usual. The heavy iron pump
stood over a slab-covered well in a small chamber
about ten feet by six dug in the side of the drive.
It was worked wich a back-racking, up-and-down
stroke, and lifted the water into pipes which
carried it to the higher ground, whence it drained
to the shaft. The face was quite a thousand
yards from the plat; and the sound from the air-
pipe, like the laborious breathing of some gigantic
animal afar off, offered no relief from the oppres-
sive stillness and the deathly atmosphere of the
drive.
It is a trying thing to a man, afflicted with the
accumulations of a hundred superstitious genera-
tions, to be left alone for any time in the deep,
extensive workings of an old mine, every drive,
and winze, and shoot in which has its tale of blood
and suffering.
Bart O’Brien stuck his candle to the side of the
chamber, and paused to listen. The terror was
already strong upon him : his mouth was dry, and
his heart beat like a plunger, catching his breath
at every pulsation. The chamber was deep
enough down and hot enough to suggest its
proximity to the flaming home of all the damned
devils in whose existence Bartholomew implicitly
believed. He had done solitary duty several
times at the pump, but never before had his horror
of it been so great as to-night. His dream re-
curred to him, and he glanced uneasily towards
the suspicious sets. He was a believer in the
portents of dreams—he expected something to
come of this one.
Catching at the long handle, Bart began to
pump, almost in desperation. Up and down, up
and down—there was relief in action, and he
worked fiercely. The pump had been oiled
recently, and ran smoothly and noiselessly. This
irritated him—he wanted hard work, something
material to fight with. And then the “click,
clack,” would have gone well to the rhythm of an
ancient Irish rhyme which his old mother held to
be infallible in keeping the elves from cows, and
which he was wont to mutter all the time when
beset by supernatural enemies.
So hard was |the mental battle O’Brien was
fighting that bodily pain or weariness never ob-
truded. With bent head and tightly-closed eyes
he toiled at the big pump, whilst the perspiration
streamed from him and ran through the folds of
his scant clothing. Sometimes the face of Geordie
Lane, corpse-white and blood-stained, as he had
seen it in his dream, thrust itself upon him ; then
his brows met in cords, his hands gripped the
iron with a force that split his callous fingers, the
handle took a quicker, longer sweep, and the
water boiled and foamed into the wooden gutter
in the drive.
Bart worked in this manner till about half-
past eleven, then he was startled by a gurgling,
choking sound in the well beneath* his feet, and
fell back into one corner of the chamber with an
exclamation, his eyes staring full of fear.
.The pump was drawing air. He had done four
hours’ hard work in little over half the time.
The drive was dry.
The young man’s left arm was rubbed raw from
the eloow to the wrist, and his indurated hands
were bleeding profusely from several deep cracks.
Bart gazed at the blood stupidly and presently
found himself listening again—listening in the
profound silence, out of which he heard at length
the distinct patter of footsteps. Small flakes of
clay were falling from the roof of the drive on to
the muddy floor, but what little reasoning power
Bart had was lost by this time in a passion of
superstitious fear. He clutched the pump-handle
once more, but it rose and fell loosely with a
clatter, and drew no water.
With nothing for his hands to do, O’Brien was
no longer able to control his thoughts ; they ran
over the history of the mine—its list of killed.
He recalled the story of Martin’s ghost haunting
the old balance-shaft, whilst the spirit of his wife,
who died of grief, sought for him after every shift
in the next level. He remembered with startling
vividness Hooke the braoeman, as he looked
spread upon the pat sheets after falling down five
hundred feet of shaft—battered into a horrible
inass out of which the face stood forth, ghastly
white and unmarked, though the brain was laid
bare as clearly as by surgeon’s saw. Then passed
before his eyes in grisly procession, showing
their fearful wounds, Bill the trucker, killed at
No. 5 by a fall; Carter, brained in the shaft;
Praer and Hopkins, smashed in the run-away
cage; Moore and German Harry, blown up in the
well when sinking; and Lane, pinched under the
shattered timber right before his eyes there in the
drive.
O Brien was crouching in the corner. No
longer understanding that it was only in a dream
he had seen Lane killed, he expected a ghost to
start up before his eyes—a ghost with mangled
limbs and a pale, blood-stained face. He remained
thus for some time, fighting the dread as it grew
upon him. At length he started up, and his fear
found vent in a yell that echoed shrilly through the
workings. He meant to rush into the drive and
make his way to the shaft, but struck his head
against the pump-handle at the first stride, and
hurled back into the water, which had risen
again to the height of several inches.
The blow and the drenching steadied Bart a
little, and he started pumping once more, with
nervous energy. Whilst he worked, the candle
fell from the wall, and hissed out in the wet clay.
He had no matches. In a few minutes the pump
was drawing wind again, and now O’Brien’s
greatest trial began.
The darkness was solid, substantial—the young
man felt it weighing upon him with a pressure as
of deep water, and his sense of solitude and awe
was such as might be known by the last, lone man
in a waste, sunless world. At times he crushed
his ears with his hands to shut out the dreadful
silence, and then he heard the passing of spirit
feet, the muffled beat of wings, sobbing sounds,
and long moans dying away beyond the distant
curves. His treacherous eyes saw fleeting forms
and tense, inhuman faces traced in faint, phos-
phorescent lines on the dense, black wall that
stood up before him. His agonised fears had now
obtained complete mastery of him, his mind ran
in a frenzy from horror to horror, and an intoler-
able dread filled his soul with hellish expectations.
.He stood transfixed at the back of the chamber,
his arms outspread, his fingers dug knuckle-deep
in the sodden reef. His eyes stared as in death,
and his mouth was open wide, the fallen lower
jaw jerking spasmodically. His greatest terror
was of the thing he had seen at the chamber-door
—the corpse-face under the splintered timbers.
He saw it now, white as quartz, with clots of
blood hiding _ the eyes ; he felt its presence—it
mouthed at him—threatened him.
Out of the darkness and the silence of death
came a faint rumbling sound, like far-off thunder.
It swelled and drew nearer. It roared in the
drive, and from the inky blackness, in a pale,
yellow light, Geordie Lane rose up with a bloody
face and caught at O’Brien.
A minute or two later, the men of the night-
shift were shocked to meet Lane rushing back
from the face like a maniac, with a dead man in
his truck.
“ Thou’s got a bad cut i’ tha head thasel’ lad,”
said the boss of the shift to Lane, half-an-hour
later.
“Yes,” he answered; “I slipped into that
crab-hole at the second curve going up and
knocked my forehead on the truck.”

EDWARD DYSON.
Whaler Philosophy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Like “The Amateur Casual,’’ “The Vagabond,”
“ I’he Peripatetic Philosopher,’’ and “ Kenelm
Chillingly,'’ I tackled camp-life, and endured it
until it became use, second nature, life and
pleasure. Only this year have I been at last able
to sound my friend, James Douglas, late of Castle
Angus, on the ethics of whaler-life. His ideas I
now give you.
“ Bad seasons do not occur. They do not exist.
Floods cause burrs and bring money for baccy and
boots, perhaps even a shirt. Fires make fencing.
Even if you have not a job you can tackle the
cooks when the boss is away, and you can live a
week after seeing a cook. Dry weather makes
whim-driving, sheep-droving, civility in squatters
and dread of Are, even up to the length of a fig of
tobacco in a station-store. But it does not
directly make boots. I can show you, however,
that down to boots every good season for me is
falsely called a depression or a crisis. That now
the townspeople of the sulky-cwm-polo class can-
not afford new boots, and their wives will not
allow them to appear in “bauchles’’ (vide Scottish
glossary). Therefore, they give me the old boots,
and the boss has to stick up new ones at the store-
keeper’s.
“ And, look here, the same lady has sacked her
slavey, so she gives me a lot of tucker and a
quarter-pound plug of her hubby’s Derby for
cutting a barrow-load of firewood. Thus in times
of reconstruction and disaster I have boots and
baccy. Fish will be bought with the stray six-
pences, because the butcher no longer calls, his
bill being large enough. With these sixpences I
can get beer and newspapers after buying neces-
saries—beg pardon, other necessaries. Wheat is
down. Farmers call that bad. I don’t. I get
251 b. of roller-flour for two shillings.
“ One can make two left-off shirts from a
shearer’s hut into one decent one. Blankets are
slung away at the end of shearing. Pipes are
easily found. Pannikins, knives billies, and
tomahawks are legitimate captures. Give me the
bad good times.
“If it rains things look up—not for me—only
for squatters. A man’s a dog when the grass is
green. But look at the pleasure of our camp!
Green gums and oaks overhead. The river at our
feet. Fish to eat, rabbits for ourselves and the
dogs. Beer for us after a sale, whisky and scraps
when picnickers visit us and lose their lines and
hooks. We have literature galore. Here feel we
not the penalty of Adam. Hand me that Shake-
speare. No, give me the gallon billy. I have a
bob left from those last fish. Mother M‘Jimmy
will give us three or four pints for the shilling.
Long live the dear good old bad seasons ! ”

“ The Men who Make England.”
We are indebted to the courtesy of a gentleman well known in
Liverpool for the following interesting and instructive particulars. He
Writes :
“ I venture to think the following will be read with interest by
you and any English people who have friends abroad, and their name
is legion. Quite recently I was a passenger by the midnight train
from Euston to Liverpool. I was travelling in a third-class compart-
ment, and with me there were a quiet, resolute-looking man about
thirty-five, a middle-aged sailor, and a young fellow who stated he was
twenty-two. The latter informed us he was sailing from Liverpool to
Lagos, on the West Coast of Africa, in the course of a few days,
which drew from our quiet-looking friend, ‘Queer place, Lagos. I was
there eighteen months.’ ‘Unhealthy?’ ‘Rather; just about the worst
you can hit on. But I kept fairly right.’ ‘How did you manage?’
‘Well, take this from me straight—cut all spirits, brandy especially,
and always have Beecham’s Pills handy.’ ‘ Beecham’s Pills?’ ‘Yes;
I’ve knocked about the world a good deal, and am just off to Rangoon,
where I have a berth cutting teak, and I should never feel safe without
them.’ ‘Right you are,’ chimed in the sailor. ‘I was in Brazil,
Santos, but a few months ago, and they were the regular thing for
keeping you right out there. I came home last week, and here is my
last box,’ producing one from out of his waistcoat pocket. This testi-
mony from ‘the men who make England’ was perfectly genuine, and it
gives me pleasure to communicate it to you.
“ I will just add the following, which was read to me the other
day, it being an extract of a letter from a prosperous young magistrate
at Esk, Queensland, to his father in Liverpool: ‘ I am exceedingly busy,
and on Saturdays can hardly get through ; and just now, if a customer
does not ask for wire fencing, he is certain to want Beecham’s Pills.
You had better send me further consignments of these sharp.’ ”
Here you have Australia, West Africa, Eastern Asia, and Brazil,
and climates good and bad. We often hear, “Co where you will you
will find Englishmen,” but we must now add, “ and BEECHAM’S
PILLS.” “
