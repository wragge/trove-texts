George Moore’s New Life of Christ
George Moore has written an extraordi-
nary book upon Jesus. And he has written
it in an extraordinary style. The Brook
Kerith (Laurie, per Dymock’s Library) is
written in the diction and the manner of
the Bible —that is, if the Bible had been
written by an Irishman. Moore has evi-
dently soaked himself in the local color of
Syria, and he has marvellously recaptured
the atmosphere of a primitive people. His
tremendous narrative runs on in the style of
the professional storytellers of the Orient,
he repeats whole conversations when he
repeats a story to another listener, and he
steeps all his incidents in realistic local
color. When Joseph of Arimathea has to
go a journey to Jericho, on a mule, George
Moore does not merely mention that fact,
but he puts his reader on that mule, indi-
cates every topographical feature on the
road, every variation of the weather, every
fleeting thought in Joseph’s mind, and even
makes frequent diversions into the psycho-
logy of the mule. The style becomes mono--
tonous, yet it is a strangely musical mono-
tony, and the slow unfolding of the story
gives it, as it were, a basis of profound
truth. And the monotone of narrative is lit
every few sentences by brilliant blotches of
vivid realism.
The architecture of the story is as strange
as is its content. For half the book the hero
is Joseph of Arimathea, the rich Jew who
begged Jesus’s body from the. cross, and
buried it in his tomb. Then Jesus becomes
the hero, and shortly afterward Joseph dis-
appears from the narrative-murdered, we
indirectly learn. Then, with the appearance
of Paul, he becomes the third hero, and the
story ends without more than a hint of the
fate of Jesus.
For Moore has taken an old legend for
his theme. According to this legend—or
George Moore —Jesus did not die on the
cross; he revived in the tomb, was rescued
and restored to health by Joseph, and, with
a mind that but slowly recovered its sanity,
went back to his work as a shepherd in the
cenoby of the monks of the Essenes at the
Brook Kerith. There he lived quietly till
old age; but we suspect that the legend did
not go on to a meeting between the living
Jesus and Paul, who taught that Jesus had
been crucified and raised from the dead. That
dramatic touch, we feel sure, was left for
George Moore to insert.
In his dedication George Moore mentions
that the Bible has been his constant com-
panion and chief literary interest for the
last 18 years. “Itself a literature, it has
led me into many various literatures and
into the society of scholars.” And he con-
fesses his vast debt to the Bible. Yet one
has the uneasy feeling that George Moore’s
lifelong regret is that it wasn’t his luck to
have written the original New Testament:
he would have done it so neatly and with so
fastidious a style. But The Brook Kerith
is a reverent study of Jesus; and he has
here painted, full-length, a remarkable gal-
lery of living portraits, from Jesus down to
the cock-fighters of the great Roman in
Tiberias.
Joseph of Arimathea is the son of Dan,
the owner of a prosperous fishery business at
Magdala, on the lake of Galilee. Incident-
ally Dan is the employer of the fishermen
who ultimately become the disciples of
Jesus. The youth and education of Joseph
are fully described, as is also the adventure
of the boy when he played truant with the
ceck-fighters. But Joseph yearns to become
a prophet, and ultimately he hears of John
the Baptist, but arrives too late to be bap-
tised. John had been baptising in the
Jordan for some hours, but the water was
too cold and John had gone away, “his
teeth chattering, with Jesus, the Essene.”
He asks about this Jesus. He is a fine
shepherd, he is told, “with a great cure for
scab he could do as much with sheep as
any man since Abraham.” At last he meets
Jesus. He mentions his “pale bony olive
face, lit with brilliant eyes his scrannel
peacock throat... .looking like a mendicant
wonder-worker on his round from village to
village, smelling of rags and raw garlic.”
And we hear Dan’s opinion of this prophet
who is taking his fishermen away from their
employer, also the opinion of the wife of
Simon Peter when the latter neglects his
trade and leaves his family with nothing,
and the objection made by the owner of the
Gadarene swine when Jesus purposed send-
ing the devils into them. And Moore
reports a yarn that Joseph had with Pilate
about this new prophet.
Being a rich man, Joseph of Arimathea
missed becoming one of the disciples; and
owing to his absence from Jerusalem he did
not come upon Jesus again until he was on
the cross. Joseph hurried to Pilate and got
his permission to have the body, though
Moore asserts that Pilate professed amaze-
ment when the centurion assured him that
Jesus was already dead. The centurion,
according to George Moore, lied when he
said he had plunged his lance into Jesus’
side. Pilate could not believe that any
person crucified could expire in three hours;
it usually took three days. Pilate added
that if he had had sufficient troops to keep
the Jews in order he would not have cruci-
fied Jesus.
This prepares the way for George Moore s
thesis. Joseph, about to roll the stone
before the tomb, returns for a last look at
Jesus, and finds him alive. He carries the
unconscious body to his house that night
and restores him gradually to health, but
with a mind dazed. “A fine story they’ll
relate,” Joseph muses, when Mary and
Martha tell him how they found the tomb
open and the body gone, “and one which
will not grow smaller as it passes from mouth
to mouth.” But Joseph is afraid to keep
Jesus, and ultimately takes him back to
the Essene monks, where he resumes his old
trade of shepherd and slowly recovers his
mental faculties. His life as a shepherd is
intimately detailed, as are also the long-
theological discussions that interest .the
monks in the cenoby. Jesus accepts God’s
decree that he had blasphemed when he
thought himself the Messiah, and lives his
life out till he becomes too old to shepherd
his flock.
Then Paul comes to the cenoby. He
relates the interminable story of his con-
version and his wanderings, his quarrels with
the disciples, his disputes with Joseph, the
brother of Jesus. But the monks are
amazed to hear that the Messiah who was
crucified and raised from the dead bears the
name of their old shepherd, Jesus of Naza-
reth ; and at last the two meet. When Paul
speaks of the Christians, Jesus is puzzled at
tire Greek name. And when Jesus tells his
story, Paul perforce believes Jesus to be a
madman. Jesus determines to go to Jerusa-
lem to prove that he was not raised from the
dead. “Paul is the enemy of Judaism, and I
am become the testimony.... If I go to
Jerusalem and tell the Jews that the
Nazarene whom Pilate put upon the cross
still lives in the flesh, they will rejoice
exceedingly, and send agents and emissaries
after Paul wherever he goes. Paul perse-
cuted me and my disciples, and now it would
seem that my hand is turned against him...
The lie is spread and will run all over the
world even as a single mustard seed, and the
seed is of my own sowing; all returns to
me.”
But Jesus rescues Paul in the desert; and
the discussion that follows leads Jesus to
the decision not to proclaim himself in
Jerusalem. “Now it seems too late to go
into the field thou hast sown with tares
instead of corn.” Paul, of course, though
troubled by doubts, puts his hesitations be-
hind him, in the not quite comfortable con-
viction that Jesus is a poor shepherd whose
crazed mind had led him to identify himself
with the Messiah. And he parts with his
rescuer in order to continue his mission
through the world. As for Jesus, all that
George Moore vouchsafes is the hint that
Jesus met some monks from India, who were
preaching a doctrine somewhat like that of
this mad shepherd. “The monks from India,”
Paul thought, “will meet him in the valley,
and if they speak to him they -will soon
gather from him that he divined much of
their philosophy while watching his flock,
and finding him to be of their mind they
may ask him to return to India with them
and he will preach there.”
The Brook Kerith is not an attack upon
Christianity; it is merely George . Moore
hugely enjoying himself on a congenial sub-
ject. _______
Australian
“Pacific” forwards a fuller explanation of
his “new constructive policy,” TJnism (Colin
Unwin,' Box 17, Fremantle, W.A.). The
author would call in the State only to do the
distribution of commodities, leaving the pro-
duction of all wealth to private enterprise.
He pictures the future State . distributing
stores as a huge machine for social service to
the community like the post office or a water-
supply system, thus wiping out the middle-
man and the retailer. “The ridiculous num-
ber of shops will be reduced.” Certainly there
are too many shops. The gloom that occa-
sionally dims the debonair blithesomeness, of
this page is solely due to the contemplation
from the office window of a vista of small
shops that repeats itself like a recurring deci-
mal —tailor, mercer, cafd, fruit-shop, butcher,
tea-shop, hnfr-cut, new temperance beer (with
ladies’ parlor, open till 11 p.m.), watch-
maker, bootmaker, auctioneer, wine shop....
right to the end of George-street. As for the
production of wealth, “Pacific” suggests that
after the war, as during the war, money capi-
tal will be forced into productive channels by
legislation. The author asks the Labor party
to bear in mind'that we are living under a
capitalistic system; and therefore to harness
the economic forces which operate therein —
not smash itself in an attempt to wreck that
system.
&
In 1836 John Franklin —who had been
a signal-midshipman at Trafalgar, and sub-
sequently went missing in the Arctic —-was
appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Van Die-
men’s Land, in succession to Colonel Arthur.
The half-dozen years or so of his adminis-
tration demonstrated that he was better as
a sailor than a governor, and when he de-
parted from Hobart in 1843 he did not relin-
quish his job with any particular regret. A
MSS. book which has lately turned up in
The Bulletin office, partly explains why
this should have been so. It is labelled
“Introductions,” and consists of a series of
letters received by the good Sir John, in
1837 and 1838, from a variety of people in
England and Tasmania who desired to find
places of profit under the Crowm for their
friends and relatives. It might have been
entitled “The Book of the Poor Relation,”
and the collection well deserved the honor of
being bound and preserved, as a memento of
early Australian wire-pulling. Many of the
letters are from Lord Glenelg, then Secre-
tary of State for the Colonies in Lord Mel-
bourne’s Government, and the majority of
them are in curious contrast to three or four
with which his Lordship equipped his own
particular prot£gds. Each one of . those
which were furnished to oblige some impor-
tunate applicant at the Colonial. Office ends
with this please-yourself-about-it sentence.
“It cannot, however, be too distinctly under-
stood that I do not by this introduction de-
sign to fetter, in the slightest degree, your
discretion as to the selection of Candidates
for Promotion in the Public Service.” This
pretty tip to the Governor is as constant as
the reminder that the Colonial Secretary is
his “most obedient servant.” But the for-
tunate few who came armed with the other
sort of introduction were probably the only
people who really scored.
Amongst many others is included the plea
of a Mr. W. H. Twining on behalf of John
Price, the famous convict disciplinarian ot
Norfolk Island and original of Marcus
Clark’s Maurice Frere, who was killed by
the convicts from the prison hulks at Wil-
liamstown in 1857. He is described as “a
younger son of Sir Rose Price, a. Baronet
in Cornwall,” as “being fond of agriculture,”
and as “a very well connected and gentle-
manly person.” And there is a letter in-
cluded in the volume asking a favour ot
Captain Maconocliie, subsequently Price’s
predecessor at Norfolk Island, the effects of
whose mildly unsuccessful experiment in
benevolent despotism the latter so effectually
corrected” during his terrible term of office.
But one of the earliest of the epistles
received by Sir John must have caused him
to wonder whether Government House # in
Hobart Town was as congenial a location
as the quarter-deck of one of his Majesty’s
ships. He is quested to take charge of “my
aunt and cousins,” who, the writer pledges
himself, “will merit your good opinion and
patronage.” Altogether the collection
quaintly illustrates one of the difficult func-
tions of early Australian governorship.

In Nature and Evolution, which is appar-
ently to be published in parts - and of which
the first two portions have now been issued,
“An Oyster” (with portrait, in the shell)
ranges over the whole cosmos in heroic
verse and does not disdain to proffer useful
advice.
Feed natural, and lead a simple life,
Avoid all stimulants —both man and wife—
And let thy drink from Nature’s fountain be
'Wwer, unmixed with coffee, or, worse, tea;
As change, a eup of milk, or cocoa pure.
Will aid digestion, and thy health secure;
Drink not whilst eating of thy daily food,
But masticate —’twill do thee far more good.
Philosophy reveals the patent fact,
The gastric juice has then more chance to act
Further on, the oyster, who signs himself
W. W. Boyes, “father of the first child
born in Townsville” and “still youthful at
80,” warns us against “vile tobacco’s dele-
terious juice,” and exhorts women to
“expand the chest by calisthenic bar. This
oyster is neat but not noisy.
The number of blokes who have never
heard of a bookshop! Here is another,
pathetically asking, from Braitlvvood, where
the special Spring number of The Studio
is for sale in Australia, where it is procur-
able and what is its price? Whenever pub-
lishers take the trouble to indicate the price of
any book, this page mentions that fact; but
the Red Page is not a bookshop. The book
referred to is on sale at the nearest book-
shop, or if not on sale can be procured by
the nearest bookshop, by the simple expedi-
ent of telephoning or writing or dropping in
to the nearest bookshop' and politely giving
an order for that book to the nearest book-
seller.
Mrs. E. Power-Pinn has had the bright
idea of collecting and publishing her War
Poems and Fragments of Verses (V. K.
Jones, Perth, 2s. 6d.), and the equally
piquant idea of dedicating these fragments
to Lady Barron, who excellencies over in
WestraUa. Also she prints on the cover
a nice photograph of this Excellency, and,
inside, an equally charming photograph of
herself.
From the city, from the forest,
From the battlefield and plain,
From the river and the desert,
From the sea and speeding train,
They have come; the little fragments,
Like soft feathers on the wind;
Catch the trifles as they flutter.
Tender threads that firmly bind.
This page has tried; but E. Power-Pinn’s
muse has evidently been under shell-fire;
there are only maimed rimes and wounded
verses left. Thus we learn that:
The Dardanelles was Hell’s gate,
The world’s great monster fort;
Too powerful to be charged at,
Or ever to be caught.
This fragmentary poet rimes shores with
cause, holder with soldier, artf ul with court-
martial, watch them with ’possum, large ’un
with bargain, idle with Bible, fairer with
Clara, envy with dozy, against her with
around her, defend with grand, toils with
isles. If there were a prize offered for the
Worst Rimer in Westralia, E. Power-Pinn
may regard it as hers. This book looks like
poetry, the author evidently considers it
poetry, and her Westralian Excellency, by
accepting the dedication, places on record
her gubernatorial conviction that it is
poetry; but this page can find nothing but
obvious sentimentality baldly expressed in
the tritest phrase. Like this:
Then rally round the Standard,
And rally round the Jack;
“The Day” has come—the pay-day—
With war-dog’s on tna track.
Forever in the foremost
There let the Bulldog stand,
For “What we have we’ll hold,” lads,
For honor and England!
Wanted: A Toast
“Gentlemen, charge your glasses! The
chairman has honored me by calling upon me
to propose the toast of the evening—the toast
of any evening where Australians are gath-
ered together. I am going to ask you to
drink to. AUSTR ALIA”
The toast is “Australia”; but in what
words would that toast be proposed? Of
course, the introductory speech would vary m
matter and length according to the person-
ality of the proposer; but unfortunately Aus-
tralians have no brief and expressive formula
that will sum up Australia, and all that she
means to Australians. What this page wants
is a phrase, a snatch of verse, a sentence or
two that will save the proposer a fumbling
effort to interpret a continent in words. The
briefer the toast the better; but it must be a
toast that will apply only to Australia, that
can be drunk only by Australians, that will
rouse the patriotism and the pride and the
love of Australians as no other words can.
We all know toasts that are apt and brief,
such as “Sweethearts and wives—may they
never meet!” But hitherto the right prescrip-
tion for Australia’s health has not been
written.
This page offers a guinea for the best toast
for Australia. It may take any shape, may
be in verse or prose, but it must have univer-
sal application, it must touch the hearts of
all good Australians.
Toasts to Australia must be addressed to
this page, and reach it no later than Decem-
ber 9.
Billzac
Hard, very hard. His land’s fierce sun has
burnt all nonsense out of him. Believes in
nothing he can’t see, but can see a good deal.
Does not read books: writes one, now and
then, between jobs. lias a rough hide, but
some tender places in his heart. Is kind to
women, remembering what a hard time they
have in his country. A fine gambler, he risks
money on the Cup or life for the cause with
equal carelessness. No saint in peace, when
the mood takes him a very devil; matter-
of-fact in murder and casual among casual-
ties —so he slouches on to glory.
—S. Longman.
The Bill Anzae of Australia —the boss
fighter—has at last eventuated. He is a
combination of the vital-motive tempera-
ment. The vital temperament is of various
heights, but mostly over sft. 9in., dark or
ruddy complexion, deep-chested and sturdy
of limb. He is fond of amusement, and
enjoys most of life’s good things. The
motive is long, lank and lean —straight up
and down like a yard of pump-water. He
does not trouble much about amusement,
being far too busy building up the nation in
Life’s great workshop. He may be found
out in No Man’s Land, doing the pioneer
work, in the workshops and in the\city build-
ing your big buildings, trams and railways.
A combination of the two temperaments
gives us a long clean-built foot-slogger, usu-
ally with dark hair, skin and eyes, head well
set up and inclined to be round (bullet head),
eyes wide apart (Bill has a good memory,
and is quick to pick up a fresh joke), pro-
jecting cheek-bones —the sign of plenty push
and go; short, thick neck, nose broad at
bridge and inclined to be pug—it is the long,
cogitative nose that stops to reason the
why and wherefore —the oug or bulldog bogs
in and does not think much and cares less,
otherwise there would be no Bill. The chin
is broad and square, lips thin and straight
like a cut in the face; no love and sighs and
kisses will hold him back when the whistle
goes. Arms and legs smaller than the big
vital temperament and more muscular than
the motive —just like a ball of rubber, active
as a stag. Girl does not worry him all the
time,, but very fond of animals and kids.
Heart as big as a racehorse, and in the right
spot, and will give away the shirt off his
back. Will drink and smoke and swear a
lot, loves ardently, but keen on playing the
man. Loves outdoor life, and if not tanned
from surfing gets round in singlet and shirt
to obtain the right shade. Will stand being
called “Sir” if one of the “Heads” is about,
but liable to wave his arms and get delirious
if not called “Bill” at other times. Has dug
up a code of his own out of the trenches —
drink, smoke, swear, love, give and borrow,
go mad at sight of Huns. And, over all,
mark you. the new “Bill” calls his mate
brother —and lives up to it.
Charles R. Mortimer.
WHAT BILIZAC READS.
I am not a Sister Susie sewing shirts, nor
can I knit, so instead I have been posting
regularly copies of our illustrated weeklies to
England. I think my first lot of papers
went as soon as the first of our brave
wounded were sent to England. On each
paper I wrote my name and address and a
request for'a post-card from the receiver. !t
was really to find out if the papers readied
our men. Well, judging from the heaps of
letters of appreciation and grateful thanks
that I have received, and still receive, from
them, I gather that all Billzac rends, or
wants to read at present, are the papers of
his dear homeland, and most of all —but I
don’t suppose you’ll let me say it.

IMPORTANT.-LOOK TO YOUR TEETH.
Tfiibrc are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, comfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set. ... ,
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possib e bj
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but
ineffectual. Hough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes, crude chalks and chaic a
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifically prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the perfection of dental luxuries. 1/- j! ie

MR. GEORGE GOODMAN.
The following testimony is from Mr.
George Goodman, better known as
“Goody” in the profession, and one of
the most widely and professionally
known of a band of brilliant theatrical
managers who form an artistic link
between the theatrical past and
present.
•Mr. Goodman has been associated with
the present firm of J. C. 'Williamson,
Ltd., for a long number of years, ex-
tending back to its inception, when
as “Williamson, Garner and Mus-
grove,” it occupied, as it does to-day,
the foremost position in the theatrical
world of Australia, and was respon-
sible for the finest imported produc-
tions of Grand Opera and versatile
drama and comedy.
Mr. Goodman’s experience with these
productions and association with the
many “stars” imported under the Wil-
liamson management, is proverbial,
and the following letter will be ot
considerable interest to the man}
members of the theatrical profession
throughout the Commonwealth, who.
physically exhausted by the exacting
nature of their many roles, will find
in the medicine Mr. Goodman advo-
cates a nerve rejnvenator and health
restorer of remarkable power and cei-
tainty. Mr. Goodman writes' from his
Sydney residence thus :■ —-

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Meeting.
Your eyes are misty dim to-night; no longer
do they shine
As once they did when their brown lights
were mirrored deep in mine.
They stare a sad, unlustred stare, like eyes
of shaded glass;
They seem to see, but do not see, the folk
who stand or pass.
I wonder why, My Sweetheart Once; for
have we not been led
To think the past is really past, and what it
gave us dead?
We went our ways that led apart, because,
at Fate’s behest,
We deemed the single way unwise, the
parted ways the best.
We never wrote a single line, no message
found its way
From either one (although at times there
was so much to say !).
We each one thought (we did not hope)
that on the chosen path
The other would experience no bitter after-
math.
We heard at times (by willed mischance)
what each had lived to do
(At least, dear one, I here confess I heard
suclnvise of you !) ;
But never by a word or sign did I myself
betray
(And, knowing you, 1 knew full well you
trod the silent way).
And now a meeting comes to-night—the
first since our good-bye....
And you are pale and misty-eyed; dear
heart, I wonder why.
So many things there are to tell—the things
that happened since
You were my laughing Fairy Queen, and I
your Fairy Prince;
The idle non-committal things: our travels
and our deeds —
The things that casual friendship so
unpicturesquely heeds.
Why don’t you start to mention them —
they do not compromise—
Instead of sitting silent there with strangely
staring eyes?
I speak of what I’ve dared and done in
questing wealth and fame —
Why can’t you laugh, and jest, and quip,
and try to do the same?
I mention those I’ve lightly met (their
names I can’t recall) —-
Say, can it be. My Sweetheart Once, that
you’ve met none at all!
Why don’t you answer when I speak—why
don’t you answer me,
Instead of sitting staring there with eyes
that cannot see?
Perhaps you are not well, dear one; a little
taste of wine
Might dissipate that fainting fit and cause
your eyes to shine....
You’d rather n0t....1 won’t insist —insist-
ence would be rude
No. no, dear heart, no need to look your
silent gratitude. ...
You will not speak Well, after all, the
fateful die was cast;
And now—well, now, enough to know
you’re staring at the Past!
N *s.w.
It. J. CASSIDY.
Non Angli seel Angeli.
Headless and horrible, with flesh that
crawled,
Decay and Death skulked down the firing
line.
The panels of the night with blood were
scrawled;
And cultured men more piteous seemed
than ltine.
O God ! after the bloody mess of war
I rested by the pools of Paradise.
Cherubs received me on that radiant shore,
Kissing my mouth, for meed of sacrifice.
The cup I sipped was fragrant as new may;
My cheek upon a seraph’s cool hand lay.'. .
And when I woke I heard the ward-nurse
say,
‘'Now take your salts, old man. You’re
right as day.”

ZORA CROSS.
Happy Song.
If you should ask me why
I laugh at life and love it,
And, as for love, descry
No other sweet above it,
Fain am I to admit
(Though this be murmured faintly)
That if I love life it
Is not through living saintly.
I am a bee that sips
Wherever there is honey ;
I pass from lips to lips
With little ceremony.
My conscience singing low
No stress of years can harden;
I love all flowers that blow
Within the world’s glad garden.
So if you think it queer
That, passing from the dairy
Where I with joy sincere
Have kissed that rascal Mary,
I woo the exquisite
Young Maud with fond embraces,
You do not know a bit
llow excellent my case is.
I love all flowers that blow
Within the world’s glad garden.
My conscience singing low
No stress of years can harden.
I pass from lips to lips
With little ceremony.
I am a bee that sips
Wherever there is honey.

PERDRIAU TYRES
It becomes a habit once you
get mileages over the guar-
antee from Perdriaus, to
always insist that your car
is equipped with the Aus-

ting in full the value of
every pound spent in tyres.

IS IT THE END OF RESPONSIBLE
GOVERNMENT?
The daily papers don’t see it yet. Even the
Sydney Telegraph, which printed Mr.
Doyle’s “interview” of thanks, congratu-
lation and forecast on the Monday
after the Referendum, did not know
what it meant. So the Telegraph of
that date merely bleated the usual
English commonplaces about “loyally accept-
ing the decision.” It murmured that the
result “does not change the attitude of Aus-
tralia towards the war”—although on the
opposite page Mr. Doyle was writing a
whole declaration that made not one single
reference to the war. It saw nothing more
than something peculiar in “the position
which Mr. Hughes occupies witli respect to
liis own party,” and could not quite “say he
still retains its confidence.” The Telegraph
didn’t read Mr. Doyle’s contribution, or
didn't know what it all meant. But Mr.
Doyle knows, and Australia will find out.
As president of the P.L.L. he ended his “inter-
view” with the sentence: “In thanking the
people for their support.... he trusted that
they would continue to give their assistance
in several other matters of vital importance
to the general community, which it was in-
tended to bring forward.” This is good plain
language —the language of the Prime Min-
ister-eleet after a successful appeal to the
country that has given him a sweeping
majority in Parliament. Mr. Doyle doesn’t
mention Parliament. He is too downright to
do any humbugging like that. He disregards
it: it'is nothing but what the Referendum
lias made it —a machine for registering and
applying the decisions of the P.L.L.
head of the P.L.L., Mr. Doyle plainly con-
siders himself to be now the real Prime
Minister of Australia. He is so contemptu-
ous of Parliament and its Ministry, or rather
so honest in his utterance of the facts and
so clear in the vision he has of them, that
ho ignores Mr. Hughes’s future. He may
or may not leave Mr. Hughes in nominal
office as Prime Minister. He will exercise
the powers by some deputy in Parliament,
Hughes or another. He will, of course,
keep up the usual Cabinet on the usual
salaries. But the work of government will
be done in the P.L.L. committee room under
his own direction as president.
* *■ * *
This is the position created by the Refer-
endum. Hughes was one of the representa-
tives of the people, and approved by them as
head of the Government. He was. respon-
sible to the other representatives in
Parliament. His business was to declare
the policy of his Government and to take
his defeat on it, if Parliament, believ-
ing he did not represent the people’s will,
refused to sanction it. That is Responsible
Government. If he found that Parliament
was against him, he might still have been
convinced that he was right, and so have
fought Parliament uo to a dissolution and
an appeal to the supreme authority, the
people. The people might have approved
him and disapproved the majority in Parlia-
ment. Then his opponents would have been,
mostly, booted out of Parliament by the
people, and Hughes sent 'back with a
majority for the effective execution of his
policy. That, too, is Responsible Govern-
ment.
* * * *
But Hughes was not game to stake his
prestige and “personality” and political ex-
istence on accepting the responsibility that
the people gave him. So he misused the
Referendum. It was a deadly blow aimed at
Responsible Government. Nobody in Parlia-
ment staked anything on it but the princi-
ple of Responsible Government, for nobody
could lose his seat in Parliament just because
the electors disapproved his opinion. And the
electors were left to hear, individually, the
responsibility for saying what the war-
situation demanded, although they had
elected Hughes and co. for the very purpose
of deciding such things: although they had
not, individually, seen all the confidential
documents from the British Government, or
read all the confidential reports of their own
military advisers; and although heaps of
other things necessary to a right individual
judgment could not be communicated to them
while a war was in progress. The people
resented this act of desertion and cowardice.
So the fight began with the people on edge
against the failure, Hughes. The P.L.L.,
seeing this, promptly offered to take over the
guidance of the peonle, and the people
accepted that offer. The process of direct-
ing Parliaments from P.L.L. conferences has
been long in developing to the simple method
of electing a committee at each P.L.L. Con-
ferepce to control the details of Parliamentary
action and Ministerial administration. But
this Referendum came at just the right
moment for completion of the process. The
committee had been appointed. It had
flogged the Labor majority in the N. S.
Wales Parliament into obedience. It
now seized its chance to deal with the
Federal Government itself and on a
matter of supreme national importance. No
nation in the middle of a war raging
12.000 miles away would coolly, readily and
emphatically vote, as individuals, for con-
scription. Yet it might, as a whole, accept
conscription as necessary, on the earnest and
fully responsible advice of its chosen leader.
The P.L.L. committee knew that by isolating
the individuals, exciting the individuals,
frightening the individuals and belittling the
chosen leaders, it could make a “Yes” vote
impossible. And thus it could shake the
nation and reveal itself as a mighty, even an
almighty, political force.
* * * *
Mr. Doyle justly assumes that this plan
lias succeeded. The politicians are cowering
before him. They have all scuttled to the
handiest dugout. 'He does not waste ammu-
nition on them. He simply tells them to
wait and see whether he and the P.L.L. com-
mittee will continue to employ them. He
also asks the people to give him their con-
tinued support in the new legislation
he is projecting. And, no doubt, his majority
will be true to him. It has staggered Re-
sponsible Government, and handed over
control to the P.L.L. Committee, which
is not responsible to the people, but
only to its party conference. The new
system of government must be given a
trial. It will end in a benevolent oligarchy,
or committee despotism—or in revolution.
Mr. Doyle is a clear-sighted and courageous
man who will take his chance.

THE DANGER OF ALLOWING THE
BILLET-MONGER TO LIVE NEAR
THE CASHBOX.
Every five minutes or so the public hears
that something or other is “the greatest
problem confronting democracy at the
present moment.” The problem thus stated
usually has no more bearing upon the big
t j iat rea ii y matter to the people than
J
a Riverma cocky s whiskers ha - up n
P l- ice of bananas at 1
public is fiercely arguing about tw open h
of tripe it is getting its pocket picked, and
omits to notice that a vagrant hounc <s
joined in the proceedings and consumed the
tripe. Some day perhaps the Public v 1
learn to detect the smell of a led hei &
and refuse to go in pursuit theieo . lie
will the world be a cold and cheerless place
for the dodger and the poisoner of the wtils
and the individual who gams much celebuty
by illicitly soaping the stairs foi the
democracy to slip on and break its back. It
will also be a world full of blanks for he
person who nowadays imagines that public
policy should be interpreted in terms ot bil-
lets for himself and his friends—who suffeis
from the delusion that the ultimate purpose
of government is personal aggrandisement
and profit. It is a delusion as old as
Methuselah. It has been the cause of
calamities beyond computation. It is one
of the really large problems of democracy
and of every other form of government except
downright autocracy ; and the innards of it
is the old puzzle of how to keep a lock on
the cashbox and make the politician walk
in the middle of the road.
As matters stand, one of the practical needs
of the hour is the creation of a fund for
buying the politician off. It could be worked
on the principles of the Licenses Extinction
Fund in Victoria, whereby a superfluous
Bung gets something to keep the wolf from
the door. The great merit of such a scheme
would be in the protection it afforded the
public against the politician surreptitiously
buying himself off at his own valuation and
thereby getting into a public job where he is
very liable to be a permanent cause of loss
and muddle. The objections that buying off
politicians in this way would be costly, and
that it would be better to simply behead
them, miss the point, because the existing
practice of jobbing individuals into billets is a
long way more expensive and is demoralising
into the bargain. And there is theadditional
misfortune that smiting anyone with an axe
is a difficult proposition when the contem-
plated victim is in possession of the hard-
ware. It would be much more simple,
expeditious and prudent, when a public man
was suspected of an intention to grab a job
or of enticing someone else to take one, to
drag him before a handy beak and compel him
to show cause why he should not be obliged
to accept a lump sum of money instead. If
that failed to put an end to the practice of
bartering billets and pay for the purpose of
getting political support or “making provi-
sion’’ for someone who happened to be in the
road —of making even membership of a Min-
istry an object of frowsy traffic —it might
be made effective by substituting sudden
death.
* * * *
In N. S. Wales lately the frantic efforts
of various politicians to hang on to jobs,
or get new ones, or have themselves pre-
vailed upon to do the indecent thing by
accepting a convenient appointment, have
proceeded shamelessly. There exists what
a number of these people consider to be a
“crisis.” The essence of this critical situa-
tion is that they diagnose themselves to be
in danger of losing their billets. Therefore
they conceive that their first duty to the
electors is not to submit to being scalped,
and they get feverishly busy disposing of
themselves so as to defeat the supposed
intention of their constituents. The govern-
ing consideration all the time is neither the
public welfare nor political principle, but
merely the desirableness of keeping a certain
number of jobs in hand. And as this in-
volves the elimination of snags and narks
named A, B and C, who are also job-
hunters, the public has the privilege of
looking on at a welter of jobbery in which
the active participants have the audacity to
pose as protectors of the communal rights
and interests. And not only are political
billets brought into the game, but depart-
mental appointments are jockeyed with for
the same ignoble purposes. There is, for
instance, a circumstantial story that J. H.
Cann, Minister for Works, is to be pushed
into a job as N. S. Wales Railway Com-
missioner. Why? Merely to provide Cann
with a steady job—at the expense of the
public and the cost of grave injustice to
every man in the Commonwealth capable of
filling the position. There is not a single
valid reason why Cann or any other poli-
tician should be jobbed into this post. There
are dozens of practical and moral reasons
why he should not, just as there are in
respect to one or two other “appointments”
that are just now being dangled in appro-
priate places. Cann has no more claim to
be made a railway commissioner than he
has to be converted into a bishop. The
“right” of other people to jobs is simply that
they are inconvenient apparitions on the
landscape. The whole of this business is
grossly indecent, and if it makes’ no reflec-
tion on the democracy it throws a heavy
shadow across the country’s institutions.
It is graft of the worst kind —that form of
the beast which uses the public purse and
statute-book to debauch the Legislature and
the conscience of the electorate. And The
Bulletin is firmly persuaded that if billet-
mongers could be cut out of the picture by
a straight-out dole, they would look no
more shabby and the taxpayer would be
better off.
THE ADVANTAGES OF A WAR
REFERENDUM OVER STUFFED
DOVES.
“Rimtj” dreams a dream :— ■
When the big tumult in Europe blows itself out
and the graves are left to the statisticians to count,
the world’s finest effort may be directed towards
securing a proper basis for permanent peace. With
the vivid red of the awful slaughter still raw in their
imaginations, it is scarcely possible that the mild
Hague Conferences and the weak-kneed obstacles to
universal destruction known as international laws
will satisfy the nations. Some bigger and better
guarantees of freedom from bloodshed will be sought.
The war-strike, long ago suggested in Germany, in
which every worker at the declaration that hostilities
have begun is expected to throw down his tools and
refuse to do a tap of work until somebody smothers
the bugle and puts the trench-mortar to sleep, seems
a tolerably satisfactory way of preventing strife;
but the experience of 1914 goes to show that the
people who might carry it out are not to be trusted
to do so. The savage and drunken soldiers who made
the villages of Belgium hideous with their lust and
brutality were the very people who at that moment
should have been standing with their hands in their
pockets and ordering Wilhelm and Von Tirpitz to
go and do their own fighting if they could find any
amusement in the game. That they didn't strike
but fell into rank behind their leaders cheering for
the sheer joy of the call to plunder shows that there
is precious little in the war-strike idea. Even the
machinery of the thing is open to doubt. While it is
perfectly true that five or six million workmen
standing idle could prevent a war getting forward,
it is equally true that a very small armed force
could do a lot towards driving that unarmed multi-
tude back to its toil. The war-strike and the Peace
Palace at Hague must stand together as monuments
of thought currents that, while in the right direction,
didn't get sufficiently to grips with fact to make
themselves worth while. Four) and his stuffed doves
the Quaker with his chocolate-cream tracts, and all
the other visionaries who have imagined that >ou
could talk reason to an enraged bdll, must stand
aside and leave the new field to those who can devise
a more practical curb for the dangerous animal to be
dealt with.
The notion uppermost in the minds of a lot of
people just now with regard to the peace of the
future is that the Allied Powers, when the final
trumpet of victory sounds, must become general
police, that large forces must be maintained perma-
nently under arms, and that wherever international
crime shows its head it must receive a sharp rap
from the constable’s baton. The success of such a
plan must depend to a great extent on the pel ma-
nent good understanding among the nations under-
taking the police duty. For a very long time after
the smash of Kaiserism and the humbling of Ger-
many it may reasonably be expected that the peoples
whose friendship has been cemented by blood and
sacrifice will stand together in love and amity,
making allowances for one another in matters of
minor importance and supporting one another in the
most practical way; but all history shows how
dangerous it is to rely entirely on international
goodwill. The mere fact that the world's police duty
with all its possibilities of friction was placed in the
hands of several nations whose methods were not
entirely uniform would open up all sorts of possi-
bilities of dissension and discord. Joint control in
small island groups of the Pacific has not been a
skyscraping success, and joint control of huge policing
armies and navies in the years of profound peace
would be a fruitful source of those jealousies and
misunderstandings which have so often to be paid for
in blood. If the universal-peace idea is to be tried
it would seem that the safest plan is, after all, the
one that has already been developed on a fairly
extensive scale —the grouping of small countries
under the protection of some big Power which under-
takes to keep order in its own sphere, while abstain-
ing as much as possible from interference with the
purely domestic affairs of the country protected. The
rights of small peoples should be jealously guarded,
but no right of theirs to stir up strife and bloodshed
should be recognised. Already this principle is being
applied in the case of Greece. Had it been applied
from the first in the ease of all the Balkan States
there might be no great war raging now.
But a surer and better guarantee against the horror
and destruction which the nations are enduring would
be found in the reference of the war question to the
people themselves. If a nation were directly asked by
Referendum whether it would or would not engage in
war, it is perfectly safe to say that the answer
would always be No. The recent Australian Referen-
dum was on a wholly different question, a question
in which the great forces of loj’alty to a trust and
patriotism called for an affirmative answer. The
noise made by the ariti-conscriptionists and their
alleged arguments could hardly account for the tre-
mendous No vote polled. The fact was that the anti-
conscriptionists had an immense and solid backing
from a host of people who instinctively hated war,
and who on account of that hatred were incapable of
nicely weighing the needs of the hour. That so large
a No vote was recorded in such a national crisis is
a very clear indication that, if the question had been*
simply one of peace or war, peace must at all times
have an overwhelming majority. The thing may be
taken as axiomatic, not only in Australia but in the
world generally, that if the people have the right to
decide, the sword will remain in its scabbard and the
gun keep as quiet as a nunnery garden, even in the
face of insults and hymns of hate. In an average
street disturbance there are 50 peacemakers for one
who gets the rage of battle in his eye; in the mass
of human thought there is a caution that must out-
weigh all military bluster. The Referendum of the
whole people is the best track to the Millennium
likely to be discovered.
But the Referendum is a democratic institution of
a most advanced sort; and its introduction into any
country implies a tremendous progress away from
autocracy. To have suggested its ■ application in
Russia or Germany or Turkey before the present war
would have been to rouse derisive laughter; but the
guns and the graves and, in the case of Germany and
Austria, the shortness of sausage have changed
things a lot. When the eijjio of the last bomb has
died away it will be a chastened and contrite
Europe that will get its boots under the peace table
—a Europe willing to listen in profound calm to
any proposal that gives a reasonable prospect of pre-
venting the recurrence of the catastrophe. Then, if
the nations could be got to swear in solemn chorus
that no war should be entered upon until all the
people had had a free say, the great principle of the
Referendum might really be established. For a
generation no such vote might be required, because
even the leaders of nations would be utterly sick of
the war idea; and after that a trial or two of the
democratic machine would convince the angriest
despot that it was more than his job was worth to
invoke the aid of the people in the business of
slaughter. Further, the principle once established,
the people liable to military service, to the hunger
and thirst and pain and ruin which war entails, the
people who must really carry the burden whatever
might happen to their - leaders, would regard that
Referendum on peace and war as the first and chief
of all their human rights. The king or statesman
who dared to attempt war, ignoring the people’s
voice, would probably last about 20 minutes in the
fierce storm of popular indignation.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The N. S. Wales Coalition to Gag the
Electors.
In countries inhabited by Party Govern-
ment and other reptiles circumstances occa-
sionally develop in which coalitions. may be
justifiable. The recent British fusion is a
case in point. There simply had to. be
such a thing there. But while there is a
lot to be said for a coalition like that,, such
a performance as has been projected in J\.
S. Wales looks about the last thing in poli-
tical treachery. It is not a coalition for the
defence of any great principle. One of its
chief objects is to extend more or less
indefinitely the life of Parliament. So it
means the establishment of a Parliamentary
dictatorship. Who gave these people autho-
rity to tear up the scrap of paper then-
tenure as members of the Assembly is
written on? What right have these Prus-
sians to imagine that the electors want to
be robbed of their privilege to grapple with
the issues of the moment in their own way •
They have no right. They are conspirators,
backed by spineless time-servers. Then-
governing motives have been two (1) a
desire to hang on to their pay and railway
passes and (21 an idea that the public lhay
be waiting for them with a sandbag. They


plead, of course, that the public may elect
a gang of “wild men” in their places. They
may be either right or wrong. But what
does it matter? It is not the function of
the elected person—invariably inflated with
an exaggerated sense of his importance—to
decide who shall sit in Parliament. That is
the duty and privilege of the elector. And
anyone who tampers with that privilege is
guilty of the grossest offence against the
rights of the people. If this coalition had
even a suspicion that it represents public
opinion its obvious course would be to
secure support for its policy from the con-
stituencies. Its refusal to do anything of
the sort is sound proof that it fears the
public would treat it with derision. And,
after all, why should we fear the P.L.L. so
much as to give ourselves over, unarmed, to
these people? The P.L.L. may have done
some foolish things. But so far as this
paper knows it has not yet endeavored to
filch the vote from the people.

The Position, of W. 31- Hughes.
It will be interesting, if not edifying, to
listen to W. M. Hughes justifying himself
in remaining in the tart shop. On a refer-
endum it is admitted that a Prime Minister
is not morally or otherwise bound to resign
if the vote goes against his personal opinion.
The Prime Minister is the representative of
a party; and the Referendum just held was
an appeal to the people on a subject outside
party. Had he been able to command a
party vote in Parliament he certainly would
not have appealed to the people. His only
justification was that he believed the
majority which he could not command in
Parliament did not represent a majority of
the people. Apparenly he was wrong. He
could not command a majority on this mat-
ter either in Parliament or out of it. If
he attaches great importance to the question
his proper course is, then, clear. He ought
to hand over the job to somebody else.
To whom should it be? Certainly somebody
who represents the Noes —assuming they get
a final majority. The majority of his own
party in Parliament was, apparently, right
as to the view of the majority outside. The
proper person to lead, if this is a matter of
vital importance that was submitted to the
people, is therefore, the leader of that
majority. It may be for the leader of that
majority to decide, after consultation with
his followers, whether a National Govern-
ment should be formed. It certainly is not
for Hughes to do so. On the other hand,
if the conduct of the war is not a vital mat-
ter, then Hughes has a perfect right to stay
where he is. provided the Labor party in
Parliament declares that what a man said or
did with regard to the conscription issue is
of no party consequence. If the party is not
prepared to say that, then Hughes has no
standing any longer. He might command a
majority by calling to his aid Joe Cook and
his followers. If he did anything of the
sort, it would be a grievous wrong to the
people and a thing done in contempt of
democratic government. It would be a plain
defiance of the majority of his own party,
who equally plainly represent a majority of
the people. More than that, it would be a
conspiracy to defeat that majority. This
paper called for a National Government
months ago. In this national crisis it was
and still is tremendously necessary that the
country should have the best administrative
brains in its-public life. But for any mart
to form a so-called National Government
in order to save his own bacon, and because
his own party has turned him down, is a
different thing altogether. It could not be
a National Government because it would
necessarily have no members of the Labor
majority which he had schemed to defeat, no
matter how able they might be. It would
be a mere junta—one of those things of
w T hich Hughes expressed such scorn a few
weeks ago.

The Public and the Gamble with a
Black Mineral.
Australia has enormous deposits of coal.
Their value can scarcely be measured in
pounds and pence, because coal is one of
the nation’s vital necessities. But that it
can be had for the digging does not ensure
that the person who wants coal will find
any at the usual address. Why? At rock-
bottom because the business of exploiting the
deposits is allowed to be a warring conflict
between Capital and Labor, and the national
interests in the bone they wrangle over are
confided to a State in which government is
too nerveless to discharge its functions. If
the persons identified with the production
of food set up a corner and announced that
everyone else could go with an empty belly
until at some undefined date they decided to
liberate the leg of mutton and sack of wheat,
the incident would be settled inside an hour
by an indignant Parliament. Where is the
difference between the community being
denied mutton and told that it cannot have
any coal? None that this paper can see, nor
any that could be explained by “Baron”
Brown, of Newcastle, or the President of
the Miners’ Union. Nor can The Bulle-
tin observe any distinction between a hold-
up of coal supplies and any of the numerous
acts of sabotage recommended by the
1.W.W., unless it be that a coal famine is
the outward and visible sign of a sabotage
that is wholesale instead of retail. That
there should be an interruption of coal-
production over the points in dispute lately
between the owners and the miners is a
scandal too obvious to argue about. There
is nothing in the dispute which could not be
settled by honest negotiation, and nothing
that will be settled in any other way. The
occurrence represents another blow at the
Arbitration Act and affords additional evi-
dence that after years of piffling the States
and the Commonwealth are able to afford the
citizens about as much protection from the
operations of labor and money combines as
they can from hot winds and caterpillars.
And the reason is that they have .never
applied themselves to the job of making the
nation’s necessity something that it would be
dangerous to tamper with. That a country’s
whipping and industry and domestic conveni-
ence should depend upon whether a group
"t nnners choose to break an undertaking
with a Court, or whether the bosses want
to work a point on the men, or upon the
result of a corroboree between half a dozen
people with vested interests in dividends or
the weekly wage, is proof of nothing except
that the country is afflicted with,
head. This paper makes no attempt to allot
blame for the strike. That is of no moment,
the essentials of the thing are that between
them these people are making war on the
country. Apparently it is judged that it is
more desirable to keep this war going than
the other one. Well, The Bulletin may
be mistaken, but it has a powerful suspicion
that knocking off work just now in Australia
is not one of the things that is going to
help either immediately or the day after
to-morrow. There will be a lot of work
to tackle later on, and the less that is done
now will make the contract no easier. But
if there is anything sticking out of all this
muddle except that the country’s interests in
a vital industry have been abandoned, some-
body ought to explain what it is.
Statistics and Public Wealth.
In 1903 Robert Giffen estimated the capi-
tal wealth of Australia at something over a
thousand millions; in 1916 Knibbs, Com-
monwealth Statistician, believes that the
total as shown on the War Census cards
will be about £950,000,000. The amounts
set down in the census returns most likely
represent a conservative estimate, the valua-
tions in many cases being guesswork tem-
pered by the knowledge that heavy taxa-
tion was likely to be based on the figures.
Giffen’s larger results, on the other hand,
were built on huge masses of data laboriously
gathered and checked by reference to volume
of trade and banking returns. Both are
obviously only in the nature of makeshifts,
for the capital of a nation is no fixed quan-
tity, but a thing in some respects as elastic
as market rates or the ebb and flow of poli-
tical tides. What is much more important is
the alleged relation which national income
bears to national capital. Giffen, by very
good-looking argument, made this out for new
countries like Australia at no less than IA) per
cent. But the potential wealth of Australia
is of no more actual value than a diamond
mine at the South Pole unless the labor that
can develop it moves with some regularity.
In all questions with regard to the amount
of taxation a country can carry, this factor
must have full consideration. Between the
time of the taking of a War Census and the
date at which the compiling of the informa-
tion written on the cards is completed, the
financial strength of the country could be
reduced to about tuppence if everybody in-
sisted upon going out on strike whenever his
dinner disagreed with him or the weather
looked cloudy. In a word, the financial pro-
blem of Australia is one with its political
problem—how to keep the people happily at
work.

Australian Waste.
Just back from U.S.A., G. D. Meudell
enthuses:—
Want of coal compelled California to harness her
waterfalls to give cheap power. Practically there is
no timber for fuel, and coal from Australia costs
28s. a ton minimum. Oil there is in plenty, but in
25 years the price has generally been from 3s. to 4s.
a barrel of 42 gallons. The ratio of cost between
coal and oil is as 84 is to 72, and both have been
too dear for the generation of cheap electricity.
Therefore the magnificent water system of the Sierra
Nevada has . been fully used to make electric juice.
Distance from the source of power is no drawback, and
it is reckoned electricity can now be transmitted
1000 miles. Los Angeles, a big city in Southern
California, derives its electric supply from power-
houses in the mountains 243 miles away. Every
creek, brook and river of importance is linked up and
deprived of its energy in small power-houses, which
send on the juice to bigger stations to reinforce the
supply. To illustrate the immensity of the hydro-
electric systems in California, the last report of the
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. of San Francisco shows it
handles in stock and bonds £26,000,000 of capital,
supplying electricity, gas and steam to 1,681,894
people in 174 cities, towns and villages. And it is
cheap electricity for heating as well as for power
and lighting. Much of the irrigation for which
California is justly famous is done with water pumped
from wells and underground streams by electric
pumps worked with very cheap power taken during
the night. Farmers are the best customers of the
electric cos., because they buy current for all
the purposes of the farm. It woflld be tedious to
detail the hundreds of small uses of electricity, and
there are literally thousands of little electric uten-
sils used in Californian homes, while every nigger’s
shack has electric-light.
The plain deduction from this marvellous develop,
ment of the application of water to make electricity
is that Australia can never hope to be the great
manufacturing nation she ought to be until her
people are provided with cheap electricity for heat-
ing, lighting and power. We have not got the
natural water-power, and so far we have not opened
up our hidden reservoirs of oil, so we must look to
cheap fuel for the creation of electricity. Fortunately
we have the finest supplies of coal, brown coal and
shale in the world right alongside our chief cities.
From all these fuels cheap-power gas can be pro-
duced. Power gas can be turned into electricity on
the spot wherever coal, brown coal or shale exist, and
it can be sent 500 miles at a high voltage if neces-
sary. Why not use Wolgan and Capertee shale to
give Sydney cheap electricity, and the brown coal of
Morwell and Lai Lai to do the same service for Mel-
bourne, Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo and all the rest
of the towns of Victoria? It can be done, and there-
fore why not do it? It is wasted breath to tell me
there is no money for the installation. Why, Vic-
toria’s bank deposits are £54,000,000, and her
savings banks deposits £26,000,000. There lies the
basis for credit, and every big thing worth doing
industrially is done with credit. There are, of course,
highly-valuable water powers in N. S. Wales and Vic-
toria which the Governments cannot employ themselves
and do not ask private people to use. They are idle
and available for revenue to the State Governments,
which seem to think that the sole source of revenue
is taxation. Australia will want new industries and
more work for her people every year, and there are
hundreds of industries, trades and businesses lying
dormant and awaiting conception on the tops of her
hills and in the seams and beds of her vast systems
of water-power coal, brown coal and shale.
Cotton.
Cotton has been under review by the Com-
monwealth Advisory Council of Science and
Industry, and the result of the investigation
suggests over again that there is a future for
the cultivation of the stuff up north. As
long ago as the American civil war Queens-
land exported 26 million pounds of this
crop, valued at £1,800,000; but later, owing
partly to the cost of picking, the game was
not considered worth the candle. Now, how-
ever, the outlook is changing. In a recent
issue of the Texas Cotton and Cotton Oil
News it is stated: "If the boll weevils de-
stroy as much of this yearns cotton as they
did last year, the remnant that escapes the
weevil will not supply adequately the world’s
demand, even if the war should continue, and
should the war cease this fall, the price of
the staple would go sky-rocketing.” To the
damage wrought by pests must be added the
increasing cost of the picking labor in
America. The nigger is now pretty well out
of the business. It is a white man’s indus-
try ; and the white man in the U.S.A. is no
cheaper and often dearer than his brother
in Australia. Picking machines of Austra-
lian invention already give better promise
of success than those tried in Texas and else-
where ; but, even if the woolly vegetable has
to be barbered by hand, Australia can take
on the job with some confidence. On the
showing of the Advisory Council, from intor-
mation gathered in Queensland, a family of
four persons can deal with 10 acres of crop ;
and this, as an adjunct to mixed farming,
is capable of giving a substantial cash return
—though how substantial nobody seems
quite prepared to say. Further, cotton
appears to be one of the few things
a novice can tackle; and ready-made
cotton farms for returned soldiers promise to
do something towards the settlement of those
big, rich areas in the North where the
scarcity of population is something like a
national calamity. The importance of the
industry to us is all the greater because of
the need to have the raw material for cordite
on hand. Cotton is the base on which the
explosive is built; and although not much of
the stuff is required by the Commonwealth
in peace times, it would show an insane lack
of forethought if we had to chase half-way
across the globe to look for more when we
needed it to throw at an invader. Already
we are once again doing a little. In Queens-
land 800 growers put in 800 acres last year.
Now, in order to greatlv increase those num-
bers, the State Government proposes to be a
purchaser of the whole crop at a price, and
to obtain seed of the very best kind. Perhaps
somebody else may next arrive with a tariff
that will give the additional lift necessary,
and Australia may definitely cut into the
world trade after sunnlying her own needs.
■■■ ' ♦
The Country Wheat Agent and the
Pool.
The country wheat agents are kicking
against their rate of commission, and trouble
is likely in handling the wheat crop now due.
The wheat being pooled, the matter is one
in which the State Governments are con-
cerned. and the wheat cocky is keeping a
bright eye to see he is not loaded with any
extra cost. Aside from that, he is with the
country agent. The Wheat Pool is allowing
the shippers handling the wheat for the
Government 3jd. per bushel, holding them
responsible for the grain they receive. The
shippers, who are half a dozen of the big
wheat firms, allow the country agent Id. a
bushel for his work, and the latter does not
reckon it enough. He declares vigorously
that this year he couldn’t make anything at
that figure, and when his work is totalled up
it isn't altogether surprising. The country
agent has to battle round to secure wheat
from the cocky, has to take delivery of it
at the country railway station, weigh and
stack it, pay for labor of covering, and is
responsible for the wheat the months it lays
in the stack. He has to load it later on
to the trucks, find new bags for any that have
burst, and pay cost of refilling them, while
finally he has to stand any loss in the weight
and chance shippers docking him because
they hold that the wheat is not f.a.q.
The agent doesn’t seem likely to grow fat
on his penny commission. The shippers, who
get 2i<3., for their part have to take delivery
of the wheat in Sydney and either stack it
or load it on ship. Of course they are held
responsible under bond to the Government,
and no doubt cannot hope for full compensa-
tion, in some cases, from agents if there is
heavy loss; nevertheless the division of the
commission doesn’t seem a fair thing. Some
shippers apparently admit this, as in the
agents’ statement to the N, 8. Wales State
Wheat Office they say :
One firm actually paid ljd. last year, ana otners m
isolated instances paid a commission of Jrl. per bushel
clear of handling. We hold a letter from another
firm admitting that at, a point where they handled the
wheat themselves, paying wages, it cost them a shade
under 1-Jd.
The agents formed an association and asked
the. shippers to meet them in conference.
This the latter, with great unanimity, de-
clined to do. It seems the shippers are ready
to consider the matter of increasing the rate
of commission, but they will not recognise
the association, desiring to deal with the
agents individually. This attitude is remi-
niscent of a past generation. And it is short-
sighted. Few things would be better for the
wheat business than a strong, effective asso-
ciation of country agents.- Properly con-
trolled. with some restriction on membership,
it could wipe out numerous abuses. By
co-operation amongst agents, handling ex-
penses could be reduced tremendously. At
hundreds of country stations half a dozen
agents have to keep men to receive, stack
and load wheat. Less than half the men,
working for all the agents as one gang, could
do the work in the same time. Under the
antiquated bag system the handling of wheat
is a wasteful business at best, but its natural
faults are accentuated by the disorganised
country-agent method. Yet the big shippers
sit on a fossilised principle of individualism
—although themselves socialistic agents
under the wheat pool—and neglect the chance
of making a big improvement. Seeing that
the Government has taken a hand in the
wheat game, it is up to the authorities to
straighten this thing out, and see that the
country battler who does all the hard toil
gets a fair deal.
Still Only Half Awake.
The history of the construction of the
“tanks’’ as given by Lloyd George goes to
show that there is no dearth of imagination
or inventive power in England, and that a
lot of fine effort can be turned to the
mechanical part of war. Yet there .is a
confession in his statement that this idea,
which has saved men, overcome huge diffi-
culties and hit the Germans hard in several
places, was not taken up until people of
recognised place and influence, led by
Winston Churchill, had done a great deal
of pushing. So in the old days inventors like
Watt and _ Stephenson had doubts cast
upon the simplest propositions, even after
they had been publicly demonstrated, and
that is one of the reasons why figures of a
shameful sort can be quoted with regard to
certain industries. For instance, the num-
ber of patents in connection with synthetic
dye-stuffs taken out in Britain over a period
of years by German and British firms was
as follows:
German. British.
1856-1860 .. .. 8 20
1866-1870 . . 17 23
1876-1880' .. ..17 13
1886-1890 .. .. 201 .39
1896-1900 .. .. 127 52
1906-1910 . . . . 561 30
The same spirit that regarded the technical
school as unnecessary and expensive thought
invention hardly worth while if there was
a foreigner anywhere to take the job from
the native Briton. There was some reason
to hope that England had learned better.
The trouble that the inventors of the
“tanks” had to get a test made of them
throws gloomy doubt upon that cheerful
assumption. England is not thoroughly
awakened yet. Will she ever be?

That tragic collection of barnacles, the
Marine Board of Victoria, the other day
decided to reduce the visual standard in
connection with the annual sight tests of
pilots. When in 1904 the Australia was
wrecked, while coming through Port Phillip
Heads in charge of a pilot who, it transpired
at the subsequent inquiry, suffered from
defective vision, the public raised a justifi-
able howl. The result was that a standard
was fixed which required a pilot entering
the service to be possessed of full normal
vision and to undergo an annual test. For
some time these annual tests have pro-
voked growls from pilots getting on in
3’ears, and having breathed its grievance
into the large, weather-beaten ear of the
Marine Board, the service has induced that
body to lower the standard to permit of To
per cent, deterioration in vision. This
means —-as the test is made with both eyes
open—that a pilot who is blind in one eye
and half-blind in the other is reckoned quite
capable of bringing a mail steamer through
the Heads! The test for engine-drivers in
the Victorian Railways service is six-
twelfths in each eye separately and six-
ninths with both eyes open. Unless Pre-
mier Peacock can spare a few minutes,
when he is not too busy spending public
money, to go into the matter, it looks as
though yve will have to wait for another
Australia wreck to bring about the restora-
tion of the old safe standard.
To return to the subject of the glass the
thirsty citizen drinks out of. A case which
the magistrates described as “hardly believ-
able” came before the Melbourne City Court
the other day. The proprietor of a soft-
drinks and confectionery emporium in the
heart of Bourke-street was hauled up at the
instance of the Board of Health for using an
insanitary glass-washing machine. The in-
spector described the article as “dirty, greasy
and odoriferous” on the inside, and as having
“festoons of filth” outside. But they didn’t
send the public danger to gaol for six months.
Had he stolen his customer’s pennies they
would have done that. As he was merely
robbing them of their health and probably of
their lives he was merely fined a few shil-
lings. Naturally he proposes to continue in
the old business. That evidently was why he
was so indignant when it was explained to
him that he couldn’t have the machine with
its festoons of filth back again. When will
we find out what gaols are really for?
Last week N. S. Wales Marine Court
handed down its comforting official epitaph
on the little coaster Tuncurry: “Nothing to
show why the steamer foundered—no blame
attachable to anybody.” The Tuncurry, with
1500 bags of cement lying heavy on its
stomach, butted into a north-east blow ail
one Saturday night until the sea started
to come aboard faster than the pumps could
throw it out again. The crew left hastily
in the early hours of Sunday, and the
little Tuncurry dived to her long rest with-
out explaining why. At the inquiry the
only person who seemed to have any definite*
ideas about the sinking was the fireman.
He had been awakened from sleep in the
engine-room by the water coming in from
the deck, and jumped up to find that lie
was wading to his knees. He considered
that the ship was overloaded. Plainly the
Court didn’t. It perhaps thought that the
Tuncurry gradually sank out of spite for
being sent away insufficiently ballasted.

The humorous idea that a good way to help
Jones in his fight with Brown is to punch
the perfectly inoffensive and entirely friendly
Smith revived itself in connection with the
coal strike in N. S. Wales. The eight hours
bank-to-bank arrangement, about which the
trouble occurred, has prevailed in Lithgow
for years; yet the Lithgow mines were shut
up along with the rest, on the general prin-
ciple that it was the usual thing to do.
Although the working or the idleness of the
Lithgow mines (which have an entirely dif-
ferent market) could have no direct effect
on the Northern trouble, the steady working
of the Western pits might have hurt the
Newcastle coal-owners, especially if the men
at toil threw in a portion of their wages to
help the fight of the men on strike. But
that would have meant new precedents, and
goodness knows where they might end ! They
might even lead to the abolition of strikes
and adherence to the Labor plank of arbi-
tration.

Prime Minister Hughes has promised to
make a statement this evening at Melbourne
regarding his attitude in relation to the
forces lately called up, nominally for home
defence, but actually in anticipation of a
conscription law being passed by Parliament.
Incidentally there is a story in circulation
about Hughes having dug up an opinion
that it is within the powers of the Common-
wealth Government under the Defence Act
to employ these men on foreign service. It
must be a silly canard. Hughes, though he
would dare much, would surely not dare
that. If such a provision is in the Act it
is there by accident. Hughes knows that
Parliament never intended to put it there.
The debates make that perfectly clear. More-
over, if Hughes believed that it was there
he would never have risked an unnecessary
referendum. But, apart from that, the ques-
tion whether Australia was going to have
compulsory service was decided by the
appeal to the people on October 28. If the
majority said “No” we are not going to
have compulsory service. We are certainly
not going to have it by a legal trick that
would turn the Statute-book into a mockery
and the plebiscite into a jest. This paper
stood for compulsory service long before
Hughes and Pearce discovered that in
ridiculing it they had been playing the fool.
But The Bulletin does not stand for turn-
ing this country upside down and inside out,
and getting its own way by working a fraud
on Parliament and people. And any politi-
cian who attempts to do it will have to be
dealt with as a public enemy, no matter how
personally unpleasant the consequences may
be.
Has the drive on the Somme commenced to
slacken or has rain interrupted the proceed-
ings? Have the Roumanians got their second
wind, or is the weather forcing the German
to wait for dry socks? Is the army at
Salonika bunkered? And what is the ex-
planation of the enemy’s failure to hold
some of the ground he seized before Verdun?
There is much mystery about these matters.
But the sum of all the various yarns appears
to be that winter has arrived at Head-
quarters for the third time and both sides
will be going strong again when its visit is
over. Meanwhile the German is intent upon
first slavering and then swallowing the
wretched Poles and making them part of the
Teuton armies. This may be taken as con-
firmatory of the theory that Germany is
feeling the strain upon her man-power and is
being driven to adopt this new method of
increasing her strength to meet a repetition
of the Allies’ wallop in the Spring. Still,
nothing has yet occurred in the field to show
that the enemy is incapable of delivering a
prompt and heavy smite by way of reply
wherever he is threatened by the Allies. And
it would be merely silly to deny that his sub-
marines are playing havoc with the world’s
shipping. There is a good deal of method in
this raiding madness, for if it continues and
the German pulls out of the war with his scalp
on, he will bounce into the business of drag-
ging goods across the ocean with an extensive
equipment, while a vast quantity of his
opponents’ equipment will be at the bottom
of the sea. Which makes it all the more
necessary to get his scalp.

The stagnant surface of municipal affairs
in Victoria has been stirred slightly by elec-
tions for the Melbourne City Council/There
were eight vacancies. Retiring councillor
Steve Morell was passed through without
opposition. So were that long, loose-limbed
jester, architect Stapley, and John Cockbill,
who will quote you a keener price on your
dead horse than anybody else in the bone-
dust business. Also Clement Davidson, who
builds chaflfcutters, with contractor Frank
Shillabeer and Henry Elliott, ginger-beer
expert. Of the remaining seats, one went
to another of the old hands, Bob Hardy,
whose special line is jam and jelly. He was
unsuccessfully opposed by lawyer W. J.
Strong, a son of the late Alderman Bill.
The other vacancy, created by the retire-
ment of Godwin Crespin, was contested by
grain-dealer Harold Ward and that curious
relic of a bygone age, ex-townclerk John
Clayton. What the ratepayers thought of
their old servant as a suitable peg for the
empty hole was rather brutally shown by
the figures—2ooo-odd for Ward and 664 for
Clayton. The old gentleman should now be
glad to sink into the back seat by the fire-
side and let his declining whiskers grow
there in peace; but he insists that he is
coming at ’em again next time.

When George got syphilis he was wise
enough to consult a medical specialist. Find-
ing his fears confirmed, he was immensely
relieved to have the doctor’s assurance that
he could cure him —in time. But when he
learnt that it would take three or four years
he saw no course open to him but suicide.
For he was on the point of marrying—in
fact, he had acquired the disease indirectly
as the result of a farewell bachelors’ supper
given him by his friends. What made it
worse was that George had been a really
moral youth : he pathetically complained that
he had had only two mistresses in his life.
But then George was a Frenchman. The
doctor pointed out to him the awful conse-
quences that might result to his wife and
children if he married before being cured
and was lucky enough to have any chil-
dren. George, in great distress, and kick-
ing at his hard luck, pointed out the impos-
sibility of postponing the marriage; but in
response to the doctor’s forcible warning
promised to think the matter over. He
went to a quack,- who “cured” him in six
months, and then he married the girl. There
was a baby, and he and his wife were happy.
The child, however, became sickly in Paris
and was sent to a wetnurse in the country.
But George’s mother grew suspicious about
the baby’s health, and a visit to the doctor
told her the truth. It had inherited syphilis.
The doctor insisted upon the parents send-
ing the wetnurse away immediately, lest
she should catch the disease. George and
his mother, however, tried to bribe the coun-
try woman to stay, but she discovered the
nature of the disease and attempted black-
mail. George and she were in the middle of
a row when the young wife entered—just in
time to hear the dreadful truth blurted out
by the wetnurse. Whether the baby lives or
dies is not known; but the wife’s father
called the next day upon the doctor asking
for his assistance in gaining a divorce from
the syphilitic George. The doctor merely asked
whether the father-in-law was any better
than George. It turned out that the father-
in-law had merely had luck in escaping
syphilis. George hadn’t. As the father-in-
law was a politician, the doctor took the
opportunity of enforcing the need for a cam-
paign of publicity against this disease.
People must be told. The refrain of all his
patients was, “I didn’t know.” So the doctor
brought in some typical patients of his: an
old woman, who couldn’t afford to come regu-
larly for the necessary treatment; a father,
who told the story of his fifteen-year-old son
infected by a prostitute; and a prostitute,
who explained for the benefit of the politician
how she had caught the disease and in
revenge had distributed it amongst men.
This is the painful plot of “Damaged
Goods,” produced, after much urging by the
medical _profession and others, at Sydney
Criterion on Saturday evening. The play, by
Brieux, has had a large circulation in book
form, and readers of that book will be sur-
prised to find how convincing a play the
medical lecture,makes. There seems, at first
sight, little attempt at dramatic construction,
since the whole of the first act falls upon
two men, and in the third act both hero and
heroine, as conventionally these characters
must be called, are absent. But there is
convincing drama in the moral struggle
between George and the doctor in the first
act; the climax to the second act is superb ;
and though the third act threatens the audi-
ence with weariness, for it becomes little
more than an illustrated lecture, the appear-
ance, of the prostitute at the last adds a
vivid dramatic touch. Yet the play through-
out is logically constructed, since the sole
heroine is syphilis, and the moral is sternly
enforced that it is everybody’s business to
know about this menace to our social health.
Good it must do; but one wonders whether
the moral will reach the right class. The
Firm has so long developed a taste for polite
musical-comedy adultery that the fit audience
for such a play as this will be diffi-
cult to find. Will Billjim take his girl?
Girls who giggle at one of the most pathetic
touches in the play, where the grandmother
of the baby expresses her poignant regret that
her old breasts cannot give the child the milk
that will save its life, are hardly likely to
gain much enlightenment as to the real moral
of the play. That moral is far-reaching.
Among other things, “Damaged Goods” is a
protest against the sort of play that is being
played at another of the Firm’s theatres just
noAV —and this seems a suitable moment for
the installation of better lavatory accommo-
dation at the theatre in which this play
itself is produced.
The production is of an all-round excel-
lence. Lewis Willoughby, as the syphilitic
patient, shows the agony and the brief hap-
piness of his married life with judicious
artistry. Stephen E. Scanlan, as the doctor,
has little chance for emotional display; but
he delivers his lecture with the right
emphasis, though in a voice that, lacking
modulation, becomes slightly monotonous.

well placed. Alma Bock Phillips, Avho will
persist in being childishly skittish, manages
to infect the happy young wife with her
youthful charm. The acting of Olive Wilton,
as the mother-in-law, ready to sacrifice every-
thing to save the baby’s life, is a brilliant and
convincing study of a hard, desperate, capa-
ble woman. In the part of the wetnurse
Gertrude Boswell adds one more success to
her long record of well-thought-out character
parts. As the other woman, Gwen Dorise
occasionally affects a melodramatic manner
out of place in such a natural play; but this
is the only blemish in a difficult impersona-
tion.

Saturday’s entertainment at the Sydney
Opera House was divided into two revues,
“In Joyland” and “The Matinee Girl,” both
nominally built round the misadventures of
Mike Sweeney (Lew Dunbar) and his friend
Clarence (Con Moreni). But it is only the
girls that really matter. Of these Madge
Moore is on the high road to lumbago if the
management can’t afford an extra scarf or
tAvo to temper the breezes to her shorn limbs;
and that Avould be a pity, for she is a bright
spot in the frivolling. Mabel Baker pos-
sesses a heap of good looks and some fine
poses; Queenie Paul oAvns more garments
than the rest and can sing better; and the
others realise that it’s no use to hide one’s
light under a bustle.
Elocutionist Lawrence Campbell, who
aspires to be the Sentimental Bloke in even-
ing dress and say “Struth!” as though he
had spent long years with the push at street
corners, is now finishing a seven-nights
season at St. James’s Hall, Sydney. The
people who trip in from the suburbs to be
instructed in Australian slang are mostly
of the gentle, home-staying sort that like
to encourage the young people to stand on
the burning deck and so on. And, of course,
they bring the star-eyed young people with
them to Avatch missioner Campbell, who is
spreading the good word of St. Dennis and
compelling admiration by his feat of memo-
rising a whole book. So the flappers of
Toorak and Bellevue Hill are absorbing Aus-
tralian slang; and when their education is
complete and they proceed to try the new
accomplishment on their schoolmistresses
(some of them have done it already), “Den”
will get another fine advt. and be denounced
in a gorgeous manner for derailing the
English language and dynamiting the dic-
tionary. Meanwhile the blameless Lawrence
Campbell leans against a green-draped piano
and sighs “Struth !”

up his grief-stricken moustache signals all

a kitten that has done a fast trip through ah

an overworked oyster-saloon waiter who

The bright entertainment provided by
the Red Dandies at the Garden (Sydney)
isn’t making Edward Branscombe any
poorer. The show has a following which
likes to back its own judgment with regu-
larity.
Allan Wilkie’s revivals of classic drama at
what the advt. calls “bedrock prices” are so
much better than the brainless melodrama
one time associated with Melbourne
Princess’s that criticism naturally falls
softly on “The Taming of the Shrew.” A
lot of people Avho welcomed Wilkie and Miss
Hunter-Watts back to the Princess’s last
Saturday had seen Oscar Asehe’s finer and
more interesting production of “The Shrew”;
but a lot of other people hadn’t, and the
laughs of these latter seemed almost to
justify the buffoonery in running riot at
times. All the same, it is a well-dressed,
artistic-minded show at the prices, and will
add a little to Wilkie’s reputation as a man

who understands how to make Shakspeare
go even with a public that has never
thought of taking the bard seriously. Neither
Wilkie nor his wife appears to best advan-
tage in this instance, but he is at least a
strong, masterful Tamer who never sug-
gests brutality. His enunciation is cloudy
when lie talks rapidly, and he is defec-
tive in facial expression where variety
is most required. As a rule, his actions
speak louder than his words or countenance.
Yet he is very effective in some scenes,
especially where he gets his gentled Kate to
declare that moon and sun are interchange-
able terms, and that old man Vincentio is a
radiant young flapper.

Miss Hunter-Watts (Mrs. Wilkie) wants
physical force for the Shrew part, and
nervousness probably accentuated her failure
on Saturday. Her attempts at violent,
viragoic rage were exaggerated tantrums.
Her shout was a scream with a crack in
it. She took such unpardonable liberties
with her fragile voice that there was no
music left in it for her speech in the final
scene. She is clever, and so of course acts
the part correctly enough, but it is quite out
of her line of impersonation. Miss Harvey
has an easy time in the character of Bianca,
“TO-NIGHT’S THE NIGHT,” AT
SYDNEY MAJESTY’S.
Alfred Frith and Waiter Bob Greig.
in which no nice, soft-spoken girl can fail;
also Miss Marie Ney, as a pretty young
widow, adds further value to the feminine
side of the cast _by singing “Should he up-
braid" with distinctive charm. Among the
army of men Landor as Biondello is the one
complete success. Varna does little jus-
tice to the part of Grumio, and Cosgrove
is a portly,. dignified Baptista instead of
the weak chick-pecked old poppa he ought
to be. Henry Dore’s Gremio has no breadth
of style, the Hortensio of Vivian Edwards
breathes no spirit of a bygone age, and
alter Hunt’s conception of the ungrateful
Lucentio (a love-sick man engaged in a
serio-comic adventure) is obscured by a
weirdly unattractive get-up. Kehoe, Bell-
bridge, Scully, Miss Sydney and others are
concerned in the good work, the others being
mostly servants of Petruchio, who appar-
ently borrows his retainers from a lunatic
asylum and keeps them out of charity.
At Melbourne Royal the horrors and
glories of antique warfare will be talked of
for two more evenings. Also Napoleon Knight
will stand out on the rock when the sun is
low, musing on the vanity of dynasties and
the foolishness of being an emperor out of
a job and repeating to himself his inspired
prediction that “the English would jot be
sorry for having fattened the Prussian hog.”
On Saturday the man of Waterloo will
assume the title of Silver King, and Jaikes
will earn a whole shilling from Bodgers the
Baker by railing against womankind.
A bit of harmless melodrama struggling
to be heard amid the conversation of several
Lawson characters—that is “While the
Billy Boils,” staged as a Cup Week attrac-
tion at Melbourne King’s on Saturday. The
piece, which is honored with a vocal prelude
supported by a camp-fire and a bloodshot
sky, has no dramatic objective. It begins
and ends in inaction around Stiffner’s pub,
with an embezzlement, an attempted suicide,
and a bedroom scene to give a throb of in-
terest to the aimless proceedings. The casual
inconsequence of the production is reflected
in most of the cast. The hero, Bob Brothers,
who is responsible for the bedroom tableau,
and is more or less directly concerned in the
other episodes, is a typical drifter in.Redclay
society. He wanders about as a returned
prodigal doing good by stealth and concealing
his glaring identity from his father, seem-
ingly from the same lack of purpose in life
that keeps the bulk of the liedclay populace
wearing a rut to Stiffner’s bar. The bar, it
may be said, is a momentous feature of the
show, but its beer is productive of mournful
loquacity except in the case of One-Eyed
Bogan, who finds the liquid an incentive to
mortal combat. On the whole, in the view of
this critic, the stage Version of “While the
Billy Boils” is not complimentary to Law-
son. The construction is crude and perfunc-
tory ; the characters are mostly silhouettes
who achieve no importance, but merely have
importance thrust upon them by the familiar
nomenclature. Steelman, for instance, is in-
teresting for his name, but as a stage spieler
he is afflicted with all the colorlessness of
which Crosbie Ward is capable. Similarly
lan Maclaren can apparently find no reason
for the existence of Bob Brothers. The rest
of the cast is, as it was in Sydney (or there-
abouts) : and here, as there, the scenery by
J. F. Mann is most noticeable in the picture
of Redelay township.
“The Cinema Star” is now in its last-
nights period at Melbourne Majesty’s, but
the days of the nights are not yet numbered
in the advt.
For one more week the Japanese acrobats
and all the other component parts of the
Cup-time Circus will take their turns at
Wirths’ Building in Melbourne. Then the
motley gathering of entertainers will go
tonring as.before and the noise of the mena-
gerie will be a fading memory.
“Sporting Blood,” “A Million a Minute”
and “The Hoitse of Mirrors” are jdl receiv-
ing the close attention of the multitude at
Hoyt’s Melbourne screen-palaces this week.
In the first-named, which belongs to the
horseflesh school of fiction, Dorothy Ber-
nard and Glen White appear in the prin-
cipal parts. In “A Million a Minute” the
lovely Francis Bushman and the staggering
Beverly Bayne succeed in proving that Time
is Money. As regards “The House of Mir-
rors,” the hero is Frank Mills, and he has a
strenuous rdle as a proper husband in a
demoralising atmosphere of gambling and
girl.
The Togos, a couple of Japanese artists,
gave a welcome touch of audacity to the
proceedings at Melbourne Tivoli on Satur-
day. The smaller of the pair set the con-
gregation agape with some incredible jug-
gling tricks, but his partner turned the gape
to a gasp with a highly-sensational Blondin
feat. Armed with a paper umbrella, he
ascended a hawser stretched from the stage
to the gallery, subsequently sliding back to
his starting point without any disturbance to
his balance or decorum. In other parts of
the programme Cardo and Noll and Men-
netti and Sidelli reappeared with applause,
and the Strollers delivered the newest
nothings from their lately renovated reper-
toire.
Up to last week-end the Pink Dandies
were still awaiting an upward move in the
thermometer at St. Ivilda (Vic.). Summer,
somewhat tardy this year, cannot be delayed
much longer, however. Probably it will
arrive in a hurry, whereon manager Brock
will be rushed by the usual horde of hot
citizens who want to perspire to a musical
accompaniment. Meantime Brock’s little
company continues to change its programmes
once a week, and its stage raiment twice or
thrice a night. The habit of giving some
numbers in special costumes is growing on
the Dandies, by the way. They were allowed
to escape from their official livery in four or
live items on Saturday night.
The most striking stage display in a quiet
week at Adelaide was at a Child Welfare
display at the Exhibition, where a gang of
youngsters took the platform and solemnly
and seriously showed the public how teeth
should be brushed. It was a turn unique
on any stage; but it was not encored. The
Manchurians are at the Majestic, and they
are striking, too, especially when they sit
on chairs in mid-air, suspended by their pig-
tails. The comedian of the Lampini pair
is something out of the common, and the
kiddy of the Howard two shows great
promise as athlete and actress. Anderson
still “presents” Maggie Moore at the Tivoli,
Nance O’Neil is on the film at the Royal,
The Push on the Somme is at Wondergraph,
John Dempster’s new Women’s Choir has
made a successful Town Hall start, and
wintry weather has returned to annoy the
Dandies’ out-door show.
Australia’s seven borrowing Treasurers
reckon that their game would be up, anyhow,
if eight hours from bank to bank got the
force of law. At least six of them want the
whole 24. The old one wants more.
AT POVERTY POINT.
"Damaged Goods”: These managers are
slowly beginning to sit up and take notice,
two Australians are pathetically looking in
a foreign country for the theatrical goods
that Australia can make herself. E. J.
Tait mournfully writes that “he is experi-
encing considerable difficulties in getting
suitable plays for Australia. Many of the
theatres cater for a special clientele, or a
certain section of the community, and the
plays,_ although they are a great success in
America, would probably not run more than
two weeks in Australia.” Hugh Ward can
corroborate this sad fact by his recent bitter
experience of short runs with imported
American pieces, obviously designed only for
that foreign person, the New Yarker. Now
he writes: “Very few pieces that would suit
the tastes of Australians are available in
New York at present.” Gome home ! There
are Australian managers who had the extra-
ordinary idea of looking in Australia for
plays that would suit Australia, and promptly
found them.
“Stargazer”: Recent enthusiasm with
regard to the growing good fortune of the
Australian dramatist reminds me that the
Australian play by the distinctive Austra-
lian writer is as far away as ever. We
don’t get Henry Lawson in “While the
Billy Boils.” but Henry as interpreted by
another person altogether, and one whose
qualification for making-up Australian mat-
ter into an Australian play rests upon his
knowledge of the cheap tricks and dull con-
ventions of the very worst class of plays
produced abroad. We don’t get Steele Rudd
excepting as mauled and manipulated by
managers and others whose ideas and
methods are utterly opposed to the spirit of
the authors. It was the same with Edward
Dyson’s two experiences. Who will dare to
say that in even the most successful, “On
Our Selection,” the distinctive quality of
the literary work is preserved in the play?
What we do get is a little living Australian
moat hung on the same old imported bones.

“THE CINEMA

MAJESTY'S,
MELBOURNE.
Part of the Waikiki
chorus.
Pinero’s “The Amazons,” which was re-
vived in London a while back with Aus-
tralian Marie Lohr in the cast, but has not
been done here since the Brough-Boucicault
days, is to be the next Repertory Theatre
production in Melbourne, early in December.
Gregan McMahon recognises that “The Ama-
zons” is not exactly a “repertory” play, any
more than “The Great Adventure” or
“Quinneys’,” but it represents a fairly-
honorable compromise between high art and
the box-office.
Actor Winter Hall, who arrived in this
country with the late Herbert Flemming
nine years ago, and remained to do much
capable work, is on the way to ’Frisco,
where he is to devote himself to movie mum-
ming.
E. H. Oliphant, of the Mining Standard,
the other dav left for Uncle Flam’s country
with “The Superior Race” and a number
of plays which Gregan McMahon refrained
from inflicting upon his patrons. Randolph
Bedford is about to move in the same direc-
tino with several sackfuls of dramatic ware,
and he will be followed after a short interval
by Louis Essou. If Australia loses Bedford
and Esson and gets nothing better in ex-
change than George Broadhurst and George
M. Cohan, the stars and tripes will have the
best of the bargain.
“Yarra Ben”: The Fullers have opened
their show-box at the top of Bourke-street,
once the National, now the Palace, “re-
modelled and redecorated at a cost of £20,000”
{vide advts.). One would have thought that
here was a good chance to give home-grown
authors and actors a chance. But bless
you, dear heart, the encouragement of local
talent, though much mouthed about, is the
last thing to happen ! The opening entertain-
ment is the same old hotch-potch from
US.A., this time called “The Flirting-
Widow,” produced by a Mr. Johnson. No
English-speaking authors, no mummers, no
producers available here! All must be im-
ported from Nasaland. Are Australians ex-
pected to support these shows ad infinitum?
Surely there is a limit!
“Give the people what they want,” said
the old manager, “and then sit back and
watch them pack the theatre.” If that’s so
it is easy to see what Sydney wants just
now. Evidence: “Where Are My Children?”
at the Royal; “A Traffic in Souls” (white
slavery details) at the Lyric; “Damaged
Goods” at the Criterion. Business marvel-
lous. The streams of humanity that poured
into the Royal four times daily flooded King
and Castlereagli streets. Women and girls
mostly. “No one under 16 admitted,” at
that theatre, and “Not a picture for chil-
dren, but every mother should bring her
daughters to see it and learn the truth,” at
the Lyric, did the trick.
“Accompanist”: With all due respect to
Melba’s judgment, the fact that Doris Leech
won the Scholarship competition seems to me
pretty solid evidence that her five years’
training under Eevan, of the Elder
Conservatorium, was sound and well-
directed. Nothing is more difficult than to
determine the true character of a voice at
first hearing, and although Miss Leech’s may
survive a stretching-upward process, on the
other hand it may not. In any case, she is
probably all the better for not having been
screeching top notes while still immature,
after the suicidal manner of most young
Australians. Melba is undoubtedly a great
singer; that she is a great teacher does not
necessarily follow. In five years or so (if
her patience endures) we shall be able to tell.
A cable mentions that the German prima
donna Frieda Hempel lias arrived in New
York to fulfil a contract at the Metropolitan
Opera House. The food shortage in Ger-
many, she says, is an excellent thing for
German women, who are becoming more slim
and elegant in figure.

Edward Laughton, just dead in Adelaide at
84, was a kindly, wiry, bearded stock-agent of
the old school. He did good work in opening
up the direct stock-routes between Adelaide
and the Darling, and thus from southern
Queensland to S. Aus. But to the present
generation he was best known for the energy
which he put into quite a new line of work,
as managing director of Broken Hill Block
14. A son carries on the old cattle business,
and another is secretary to the S.A. Automo-
bile Association.
The N. S. Wales striking coal-miners want
“eight hours from bank to bank.” The owners
say it means from bank to bankruptcy.
The committee for wiping German names
off the map of South Aus. ( Surveyor General
E. M. Smith, Talbot of the same department
and Rodney Cockburn) has published its
first report. It finds 07 names to be dealt
with, and suggests a native substitute for
each; but it points out that an awful mess
will be made of postal, railway, survey and
other matters, and also of title-deeds, if the
change is made in every case. About the
best known are Halmdorf and Lobethal and
the big railway-town Petersburg; these are
to become Yantaringa, Marananga and
Nullya. Hergott, in Central Australia, takes
its already-known official name, Marree. The
committee points out the' great delicacy of
knocking out personal names, bestowed as a
reward for service rendered to the State,
such as those of old Dr. Schomburgk (father
of the present Sheriff), and the Australian-
born, still living, and very popular Yon
Doussa. But that is not its business. It just
makes a report, and Parliament has to settle
whether those districts shall in future be
Ivoerabko and Winikeberick.
WHAT’S THE USE?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I sit in my seat by the missus’s side,
Like a dutiful, loving hub;
The show —it don’t matter. I close my eyes
And dream of an open pub!
I wake when the interval comes along,
And wrathfully murmur: “The deuce !
This used to be where I enjoyed the play,
But nowadays—what’s the use?”
The mythical “man” and his mythical “dog”
Have served me many a turn,
But the wheeze is as dead as mutton now ;
And no matter how much we may yearn
For the “good old times,” they have gone for good;
Life’s a lemon—we’ve squeezed the juice!
So 1 sit by the missus’s side all night,
And I'm thinking. “Oh, what’s the use?”

SOCIETY
“Pumps’ - : Now that the inquiry into the
loss of the Tuncurry has concluded I uproot
myself to remark that if any more ships
mysteriously spring leaks and sink off the
Australian coast I’ll ask the Navigation De-
partment if it knows that a large proportion
of the crews of our home-water ships are
foreigners by birth, and that others who have
access to vessels are of divers and dubious

nationalities. The Tuncurry is the third
wooden steamer that has sunk, or been sunk,
off the coast in the last few months, and she
had emerged from dock with a marine certifi-
cate 24 hours nefore she went to the bottom.

This is the first The Bulletin has heard
of it from France: —
Re the complaint of Bulletin' correspondents that
Australian soldiers have to travel third-class in
Egypt, even when on leave, and though prepared to
pay for first- or second-class tickets. That is all quite
correct, and the same thing occurs also here in
France. I admit that the same objection to riding
third does not exist here as in Egypt, where the
third-class is the insanitary class; but that is no
excuse for refusing the citizen soldiers of Australia
the right to travel in their own time in whatever
class they please and that they are prepared to pay
for. If we stayed at home we could warm our feet
in any class we cared to buy a ticket for. We would
be quite good enough for the first-class. But because
we are doing our job we are denied the rights of the
shirker at home —and denied them in our own time.
Is there nobody in authority in Australia who will tell
the authorities here that these things must not be?
“N. or M” : As to Albert Butterfield (B
12/1.0/T.O) remembering King William IV.. I
know a man who has seen at man who saw
King John —the party who got involved with
barons and Magna Charta at Runnyinede at
the beginning of the 18th century. The way
of it was this. Some decades ago Dean
Stanley (who is of interest to Tasmanians as
the father-in-law of ex-Bishop Montgomery)
took it into his head to spring-clean West-
minster Abbey, and in the process made a lot
of gruesomely interesting discoveries. Some
freakish preservative influence had here and
there defeated the lapsing years, and of the
beauty of Anne Boleyn there remained one
small and shapely hand and a mass of hair
which must have grown after death and half-
filled the coffin. King John lay practically
unchanged for all his 700 years of burial, but
at the touch of air the body crumbled away
almost immediately. Some post-mortem
humorist had apparently had a hand in the
funeral arrangements of James 1., for the
royal author of “A Counterblast Against
Tobacco” fell to dust with a tobacco pipe at
his side.

“Melos”: It’s no good looking too far
ahead. An eccentric old chap on the
N.S.W. North Coast recently died, and went
to his rest in a coffin which was not the
one he had made for himself 20 years pre-
viously. A few weeks before he passed he
got into the home-made shell to test its
holding powers, and found that Time had
played a mean trick on him. He had broad-
ened so much that he had hard work to
get out. “No good,” he remarked; “very
uncomfortable about the shoulders.” He
was engaged on a revised edition when
Death foreclosed and winked at the under-
taker.

“F.A.Q.”: Collins, of the Federal Trea-
sury, has a museum of strange relics,
amongst them a pallid pile of blurred bank-
notes. This is their story. A hayseed
sold his home farm on the walk-out-
walk-in plan, and had various drinks to
celebrate the deal. Pretty soon he was
groggy, with a roll of notes bulging his coat
pocket. Meandering round for a soft place
to sleep, he hung his coat over a sapling
fence and dozed off. When lie awoke there
was a goat cheerfully chewing his hanging
garment, and the pocket containing the notes
had already been swallowed. A police-
trooper heard the tale of woe, shot the goat,
and sent the stomach to the Government
analyst, who in turn sent a lump of pulp to
the Treasury. The Treasury, having washed,
ironed, sorted and joined up the salvaged
fragments, redeemed the notes and paid the
farmer, less expenses, their original face
value.

Premier Vaughan (S.A.) makes a per-
sonal explanation :
Mr. Lundie says 1 had been afraid to sleep at my
house during the last few weeks because I was fright-
ened of being- murdered.-.. .If he will give me a ring
when his friends purpose to arrive to do the deed I
shall promise that they , shall have as warm a recep-
tion as a certain member of Parliament once gave
Mr. Lundie, who ran away from him.
Then Lundie goes to the wicket: —
We are not out to take life, neither are we, like
Mr. Vaughan, prepared to force men to go to a
danger zone where he lias not gone himself. I have
no recollection of ever running away from a man in
my life, and,, with all the difference in age, I can
assure Mr. Vaughan that I will not run away from
him. I can be found at 15 Flinders-street any day,
between the hours of 8 and 5.30, and will assure
Mr. Vaughan that, as he has a tendency that way, I
will endeavor to accommodate him.
There has been nothing like it since the
joyous days when C. C. Kingston wrote to
Chaffey Baker proposing- that each of them,
armed with a pistol, should leave his office
at a certain hour, and meet in the middle of
Victoria Square to see what would happen.

When isn't the “only son of a family” an
only son? The Defence Department sug-
gested that he ceased to be one when there
was nobody else in the family—that if there
wasn’t a “family” he wasn’t the only son of
a family any more. Justice Hood, however,
sitting as the Appeal Judge from Victorian
military exemption tribunals, decided that the
young man was “the only son of a family”
even if lie was the whole family. But when
precisely the same sort of orphan came in
front of Justice Street, his Honor of N. S.
Wales didn’t regard him as an “only son of a
family” at all, but would follow the Vic-
torian ruling for the sake of uniformity.
Whether any only sons should be exempted is
of course another matter; but if they are
exempted, there is a larger reason why the
only son of parents who are dead should be
exempted than why the only son of parents
who are not dead should be. The only, son
isn’t exempted for the sake of comforting the
old people. If that were the reason of course
it would disappear with the old people’s
death. Not for that but for the mainte-
nance of the family and the family name
have only sons been freed since the days
of Moses. And when dad has gone, a larger
responsibility than ever seems to be thrown
on the only male of the name who is left.
“F.0.E.”: Who said “preference to re-
turned soldiers”? Alex. Slater, a returned
engineer corporal with 12 months’ Anzac ser-
vice to his credit and a wife and family to
keep, lately applied to the commandant of
Warrnambool (Vic.) camp for the right to
trade in soft drinks, fruit, cigarettes, etc., and
was told the camp chiefs could do nothing-
without permission from the panjandrums of
the service. A few days later Slater found
that a local storekeeper in a big way of busi-
ness had secured the camp trading rights, and
had started in. The ex-soldier saw the com-
mandant again, also the adjutant. After
admitting that he had applied first, both
officers explained that they had been “asked
to consult the local storekeepers.” Slater had
been at the camp twice daily, but had been
told nothing about the fortunate storekeeper
or the momentous “consultation,” in which
(apparently) the storekeeper had strongly
recommended himself. And a big home-stay-
ing storekeeper’s recommendation of himself
seems to carry greater weight with some of
these Defence people than that of a small
soldier who has spent himself in the country’s
service.
“Imslii” : During our Romani fight in the
desert, a Light Horse lieutenant came across
a plump major wounded and unhorsed under
a hot fire. The mounted lieutenant had
reached down swiftly and grabbed the
slack of the major’s pants, when something
that jarred like a fast express hit the back
of the hand and made a hardened cam-
paigner yelp in sudden agony. When the
major was tabled for examination the doc-
tors found in vivid black and blue an im-
print of the hand. The smack of the bullet
had made the lieutenant involuntarily smack
the major where he used to be dealt with
when he was very young.

In this year of Spring belated ;
And only now she blossoms in her frocks.
She has waited till the roses
Ere her bosom she discloses,
And makes new revelations' of her socks !
But it's now the time of staring
At the “V,” so deep and daring—
She really doesn’t care how much one sees.
And her skirts so thin and filmy
With a Springtime gladness thrill me;
And I'm grateful for the naughty summer breeze.
And when the sun's behind her
She’s as Nature had designed her;
It's really nice to know that she has knees 1
Beneath the dainty laces
Of her camisole some traces
Of the girl can be discovered if you peer.
Last year —the memory rankles —•
All we saw of her were ankles,
But now the fact that she has calves is clear.
If her “V” gets more surprising
And her skirts still keep on rising,
What will be left to cover up next year?
Oh, it’s Summer with its brightness,
And the girls in dainty Muteness
Once more the city pavements welcome back.
But this year there’s something duller
In the Summer’s shout of color;
Some touch these gallant blossoms seem to lack:
And it’s sadness to remember
When you see, this gay November,
So many of the Summer Girls in black!

Mining-expert Cecil Rae, now a lieutenant

uiachi to Mesopotamia, sends an applica-
tion from a Mohammedan field clerk for a
job in the illustrious regiment:—
Sir,—l am a poor man, live in the Masjid and get
food once a day at night, and on the morning* 1
always fast. I read in the School in this manner, my
School fee is free.
„Jr'I ha n nB ' r«i SS f d Ia doctory, have been working

humbly and respectfully request, you pity upon my
state and send me with this Corps to Basrah or fix pay

If you Delight me, God will Delight you and
succeed you upon your enemies. I will pray for you
and your children. The rich and wise should help the
poor. May you be happy. May God fulfil your wishes.
Hoping my this humble petition will get favorable
reply from you and jiisthan, I beg to remain, Sir,
your most obedient servant, Maula Btjx.
“W.L.” : The prevalence of cerebro-spinal
meningitis in military training-camps seems
to indicate that while the medical units are
able to hold the trouble in check they are
unable to place a finger upon the means of
contagion. Here’s a tip gathered from the
striking fact that few officers have contracted
c.s.m. I believe that the disease is dissemi-
nated by dirty or half-washed food utensils.
Army feeding ironmongery is supposed to be
washed in boiling water, but theory and prac-
tice are often miles apart in this as in other
matters so far as the rank and tile are con-
cerned. But woe to the mess orderlies who
do not thoroughly scour in boiling water the
officers’ tinware! Now, don’t all you girls
speak at once—what about a wash-up corps?
"Hamer”: The old trouble between the
rural workers and the farmers is coming
up like a cloud over the harvest paddocks.
A couple of years ago the A.W.U., which
had taken over the Rural Workers’ Union,
announced that, on account of the war, it
would not press for a recognition of the
log rates. There was a strong suspicion
then that the war was merely being used as
a screen until the organisation of the farm-
workers was complete. Now, with the war
going as strong as ever, the big Union —full
grown and ready—has served notices of its
demands on the farmers, asking for an
immediate settlement of the claims. In the
meantime, various branches have been carry-
ing resolutions resolving to adhere strictly to
the log. If the farmers create any delays in
getting the matter -before the Arbitration
Court the argument may be fought out in
the bad old way.
“Dogberry”: Victoria has some quaint
specimens hidden behind the plenteous
whiskers of its honorary justices, but its
sudden need pf beaks to preside at military
exemption courts has brought to light certain
aged police magistrates who leave the Jay
Pays little to boast of. St. Kilda court
smiles daily at the chattering* of Majah
Bartrop, an old gentleman of 80 who cheer-
fully compares symptoms with the more
senile of the witnesses. Recently he turned
a sympathetic ear to a sufferer from neuras-
thenia who was being curtly treated by
the military representative.
“You may not have had
neurasthenia. I have,” he
said feelingly. Another
old gaffer complained of
varicose veins. “I sympa-
thise with you,” chirruped
Bartron. “Forty years 1
suffered. Then one day T
threw off the bandages, and
have never suffered since.”
Then he cheerfully com-
pared ages, and each of the
oV boys found he was over
SO. "Why, I was riding a
bicycle till I was 80,” he
told another witness, whose
father, aged 60. was, in
Bartrop’s opinion, "not
aged.” He was moved by
the tale of the indifferent
health of another to con-
fess, "I am more than 80
and do not suffer from a
single disorder.” Nowa-
days the St. Kilda court
resembles an infirmary
where the oldest 'inhabi-
tants spellbind oue another
with tales of lumbago,
spavin and ringbone. And while Australia
waits for its army, the beak whose job it
is to give it men chirps away about his
varicose veins. There are men in the Flan-
ders trenches who wouldn’t care if he had
bot-fly and string-halt.
“Silas Snell”: On a warped pine board
were the words: “R. Bone, Licensed Vic-
tualer.” The board was nailed to a tree.
A crazy finger pointed to the humpy almost
hidden in saplings. Seven people in as
many miles had told us we would come to
Bone’s pub if we “kep’ right on,” and here
was Bone’s pub. It was sadly unpromising,
but we had come far, and the day was hot,
and we were no longer disposed to be
critical. Bone was sitting on a stool under
his “verandy,” drowsing, with his face
turned up to Heaven and his mouth ajar.
We knew now why the flies had not
troubled us for three miles. They were all
about Bone. We had just decided that Bone
had been sampling his stock when our atten-
tion was drawn from the chief purpose of
our visit by a strange cry. It was a long,
thin, plaintive feminine cry. and came from
nowhere in particular. Each man looked in
a different direction. Talick went into the
pub. The cry was repeated. Burt looked
round the end of the house : I examined the
roof. Talick returned. "No one indoors,”
he said. Bone was now awake. “’S all ri’,
boys,” he said. "Tha’s on’y my missus. She’s
locked in the cellar.” “And what the
do you lock your wife in the cellar for?”
Talick exclaimed. Bone patted him with a
propitiatory palm. “Pure kin’ness, my
boy,” he said ; “pure kin’ness. Poor thing,
she can’t bear to see me drinking!”

sions. go about looking for bother—-and

lime satisfaction, and knowing the pubs now
closed at six I wondered, and inquired
wherefore. "It's the fun of life,” he said.
"There’s Stivirus, and Tanks, and Slabb and
Borndrunk that I’ve had it in for, but they’ve
always been too good for me. Now every
one of them has claimed exemption as a con-
scientious objector who, if you passed him
a woodener on the left cheek, would turn the
right and ask for another. So now I’m
going to give them another —several others.”
I don’t know how he got on. but I’ve an
idea that this sudden outbreak of Christian
non-combativeness isn’t as reliable as Blivins
thought it was.
N.S.W. Congregational Union mentioned
an important matter: —
One aspect before the Churches was whether
when syphilis had been introduced into the family
circle the discovery should not constitute a suffici-
ent ground for divorce against the guilty one.
Which is right enough providing there is
a guilty one. But syphilis may be intro-
duced into the family circle by the most
innocent person in the world. Anyone may
contract the disease by using an uncleansed
beer-mug—or communion vessel, for that
matter —after an infected person ; and it is
quite conceivable that such a person might
pass the curse along unwittingly. Owner-
ship of the disease isn’t either a crime or a
punishment; and the notion that it is one
or the other is the notion that is at the bot-
tom of the Church’s unchristian handling of
the problem hitherto. Not that the Congre-
gational lot deserve to have the worst things
said about it. As a matter of fact, it mostly
takes its black coat off and hangs its halo
on the hat-rack when it handles this ques-
tion.
Mr. Bung has a new worry. Action was
taken last week against him at Geelong for
allowing a person to be in his bar during
unlawful hours, to wit, Sunday, October
29. This was the Sunday of the long-
drought in Victoria. The new law had just
closed pubs at 6 p.m. and delayed the open-
ing of them until 9 a.m., and a Federal
order had made polling day wholly dry. The
landlord in the Geelong case declared on his
oath that he had closed and bolted his bar
in accordance with the State law and the
Federal command, and the man captured in
the bar admitted that he was there without
the cognisance of the proprietor. Knowing
that the pubs were to be closed from 6 p.m.
on Friday to 9 a.m. on Monday he had hid
in the cellar, electing rather to be locked
in than closed out. Nevertheless a convic-
tion was recorded against the publican. So
a new danger threatens Bung—the stow-
away. '
“R.P.W.” (Sinai) : Our Army Medical
men are building up a great tradition in the
desert. During the recent fighting on this
Peninsula a Light Horse field ambulance
particularly distinguished itself, winning in
six days’ fighting no less than 10 honors—
ii record of its kind,
I should imagine,
for a unit with a
total strength of
120 men. To an
officer fell a Military
Cross, and to the
rank and file six
Military Medals and
three Servian Medals.
No other unit’s fig-
ures in any way
approached these.
For the short period
of fighting they ap-
pear extraordinary,
but all were well
and truly won.
Camels, mounted
with cacelots (sit-
ting-up and lying-
d o w n stretchers,
specially designed
for the conveyance
of wounded), are
used for the evacua-
tion of wounded, but
are not a success.
In lying-down cace-
-1 o t s severely
wounded men endure
tortures, as the roll-
ing motion of the
camel causes the
stretcher to tip up
and down violently
from head to heel.
Poor Billjims! I
know what they suf-
fer, having brought
30-odd men across
the desert —20 miles
of hell that took eight hours by the watch
and eight eternities measured by their
agonies.
* * * *
During the South-West African campaign
the Ilun played the land-mine trick for all
it was worth and a bit over. When he light-
heartedly hanged three unlucky Hottentots
for daring to fight him fairly, lie mined the
gallows-tree, and the three British troopers
who later approached to cut the bodies down
were blown to bits with the tree and what
hung on it. Near by the helmeted savages
had gone to the unusual trouble of digging a
grave and putting a cross at the head of it
for a fallen British Intelligence Officer whom
they had no reason to love. But there were
no mourners caught by that obvious trap.
The hidden mines round the dead were pain-
lessly extracted by the engineers, and the
column moved on grimly to the next devil-
ment.

“Melb” : A few months ago Vida Gold-

bloomed into considerable Latrobe-street pre-
mises, with a big window labelled “Women’s
Non-Party Political Society, Peace Army
and Labor Bureau.” But their enemies,
smelling a rat and starting to burrow, soon
discovered that Premier Peacock was paying
the group £4O a week subsidy—for nobody
knows what. There was a row, of course,
the subsidy was cut off, and now the proud
establishment has placards up “To Let.”

sweet
From the crown of her hat to her pretty, small l'eet;
She was roguish one moment, the next moment meek,
And the blushes that fitfully coursed o'er her cheek
Seemed like some subtle essence by magic expressed
From the red rose she wore on her breast.

Who was hovering near, with a chuckle of joy
Loosed a shaft from his bow, and the mischief was

In the soft, golden light of the westering- sun
The man told a tale that is old as the skies -
And she listened and lowered her eyes.
She was dressed all in white and her eyes were
sublime
With that wondrous, soft light that since earliest
time
Has lit mother faces ; and there on her breast
Lay something her mother-hands gently caressed —
A replica, surely, from small head to toe,
Of the little winged boy with the bow.

And he said the same things that all fathers have

Since the ages weld l young and the river of life
Brought the firstfruits of love to the earliest wife.
They knew that they two were especially blest —
And the sun winked his eye in the west.
She was dressed all in drab ; she was ample and mild
As she fastened a bib on a freckle-faced child,
And fed him and bathed him and put him to bed
And planted a kiss on the side of his head,
And stirred up the stew and adjusted her comb,
And waited for him to come home.
He looked and was dumb with the dumbness that
comes
To the man who has eaten the last of the crumbs
Of the food of Romance, whom monotony grips
Till he longs to return to the old fellowships.
He swallowed the meal he had learned to detest —-
And he made for the pub in the west.

P. D. McCormick, the composer of
“Advance, Australia Fair,” which the N.
S. Wales schools have adopted more or less
as a National song, died suddenly at Waver-
ley (Sydney) on October 30, aged 83. Fie
was born at Port Glasgow, served his
apprenticeship as a joiner, and reached
Sydney in 1855. At first he followed his
trade ; then he became a school teacher and
served the Department for 20 years; finally
he devoted himself to church work and the
cultivation of music. Ilis “Advance, Aus-
tralia Fair” was first sung by Andrew
Fairfax in 1878. McCormick shone as a
conductor of large hordes of children. In
the Raikes sunday-school centenary he led
a choir of 10,000 youngsters and 1000
teachers, and at the laying of the founda-
tion-stone of the Queen’s statue 15,000
children piped under his baton.

1916. He died for us too !
A kindly soul and a fine pressman parted
company when T. D. Speight died at Sydney
last week. He was English born and Eng-
lish trained, his last paper in the old land
being the Leeds Mercury. Largely with
the hope of eluding in the Sunny South a
health-enemy, Speight arrived in Australia
a few years ago and appeared on the Inky
Way in Hobart. Later he joined Sydney
Telegraph, and thence went to Federal
Hansard, a job he was particularly fitted
for by reason of his intimacy with all
shades of politics in Australia and his great
skill at shorthand. Few foreign pressmen
gained such a knowledge of the ideals of
the Australian democracy as the one who
has gone. But, then, he was-not a foreigner,
but a. good Australian who had been mis-
laid in the post.
When the police ran the net round the
I.W.W. people in Perth, they hauled
in Montague Miller, who is a veteran
militant, 85 years of age. He was at
Eureka in ’54, and has since done a heap of
fighting all over Australia. >, In spite of a
strong plea for bail on account of his years,
he remains in Perth gaol, which is not an
ideal asylum for an old man. Other identi-
ties implicated with him include Jack O’Neil,
a journalist who earns his crust on the
Westralian Truth, and W. W. Siebenhaar,
Deputy Registrar-General, who has been
suspended on a charge of disloyal conduct.
Siebenhaar is a Hollander, and published a
few years ago a volume of verse entitled
“Dorothea.” But nobody is bringing that
up against him.
David Stodart,of Toorak (Vic.),who passed
out a few months ago, has been followed
by his old friend and neighbor, the ancient
Thomas J. Finlay. Finlay’s connection
with the squatting world was long and very
intimate. He spent much of his life in
Melbourne as a stock and station agent,
owned a succession of stations, made a
great deal of money and always kept to the
narrow Prusbyterian way, even though he
was one of the oldest members of the Aus-
tralian Club. He had a great respect for
money; but though himself a wealthy man
for many years, it was only in old age that
he forsook his dingy old dwelling at South
Yarra and planted his armchair at the top
of Toorak. His family is all in the squat-
ting business.
Mrs. William Howell, just dead at I van-
hoe (Vic.), after battling for 83 years with
the trying climate of Australia, was a daug i-
ter of Captain Downey, who was m com-
mand of the company that dug the grave loi
and fired the salute over the body of bn
John Moore at Corunna. His first-hand
report of the proceedings differed altogether
from the poet Campbell’s. No sod was
turned with bayonets, and “Not a soldier
discharged his farewell shot” is only another
case of the way truth is hashed for the sake
of rhyme. Captain Downey went to Tas-
mania in 1833 at the invitation of his old
commander, Colonel Arthur, then Governor
of the Speck. In 1837 he crossed to \ ic-
toria and formed a squattage at Shelford,
near Geelong, where he died.
The wreck of the Howard Smith steamer
Dandenong off Jervis Bay on Sept 11, 1876,
is recalled by the death of Frederick Asli
in Switzerland at the age of So. The
steamer was between Sydney and Melbourne
with 60 or 70 passengers when she was
caught in a hurricane and foundered, it
was surmised with all hands. Fred Ash, a
prominent Newcastle business man, was a
passenger, and when news of the loss of the
steamer reached Port Hunter the city went
into mourning. Then the surprise happened.
A leisurely sailing collier dawdled into port
with a number of the Dandenong’s passen-
gers, amongst them Fred Ash. Still, 40
others had. gone down.
“Billy” Du Rieu, the old coach-driver, is
dead in Adelaide af last, at the age of 85. He
used to drive on the Port-road prior to the
railway days, and continued to race the train
for a year or so before recognising the in-
evitable. After that, he took to the South-
road, and finished up as a prosperous hotel-
keeper. By the verdict of John Hill —who
himself might have made a claim to the
honor —Du Rieu was the best whip in sight
at a time when everybody could drive.
Another Australian Rhodes scholar has
made the great sacrifice. He was 11. E.
Whiteman, of Westralia, a young man with
prospects of an enviable future. At the
tail end of last year he left for England and
the universities, but on arrival enlisted and
eventually was transferred to the Flying
Corps. An accident while at work closed
the chapter.
They won't talk about it. Lieut. Marcel
Aurousseau, now fighting for the British
over the fields where his. great-grandfather
battled for Napoleon, describes how lie was
wounded and won a Military Cross, at
Pozieres: “We went out to attack, and got a
hiding, and I was hit.” He insists that
nothing else happened. A brilliant young-
scholar from Sydney High School and a
medallist of Sydney Uni., lie was lecturer in
geology at the sister “shop” in Westralia
when lie heard the call.

were born in. The Milsons and the Shairps

but heard the call of the Coolgardie gold

with a pick. Here he obtained his first pro-
minent connection with the labor movement,
and served on the Coolgardie Trades and
Labor Council. Ten years ago he was
washed ashore in Wellington (M.L.) and
Secured a job at a pub. He was soon dis-
gusted with the conditions of the hotel ser-
vant, and set to work to organise this
tough class. . It was a hard task, but he
succeeded so well that perhaps nowhere in
the- world have hotel staffs to-day so many

The Vic. Tourist Bureau is a monument
to the energy of one man, John Boyce. Boyce

you what time the last train would leave

bathing-beach and not to forget your bathing-
costume, and then have enough breath left to
say “Don’t mention it!” and "Good-morn-
ing!” before he started on the next inquirer.
Now he reigns over a large suite of offices
and has a daily turnover of inquiries that
must mean a lot of business for somebody.
Boyce is an earnest advertiser of his own
country, too, apart from his special job,
and his knowledge of its resources is immense.
So far, urgent as the need is in Victoria for
the pruning-knife in public affairs, no re-
former has yet arisen to make threatening
passes at John Boyce’s well-built billet.

Bare the head who speak his name!
Once he burnt his manhood’s flame
Wantonly until it came
Low and low to ashes’ shame.
He has passed beyond all blame.
Who denies it? Who shall dare?
Since he died at Pozieres.
Since he died at Pozieres
This is what his life shall mean:
Once, a child, he used to lean
Where all baby lips have been.
Later, Heath came straight and clean.
There was nothing in between
These two chapters brave and fair,
Since he died at Pozieres.
Since he died at Pozieres
Tending Honor’s fliek’ring light,
E’en a child’s soul silver-white
Than his own is no more bright.
Gabriel, with arms of might
Lean from out the starry night!
Salve his wounds and give him care
Since he died at Pozieres !

It’s a hard world for the I.W.W. and full of
disappointments. Here is a co. which in-
cludes some of the Fattest men in Sydney:
chairman George Judah Cohen ; members in-
cluding a Binnie, a Fairfax and Thos. Buck-
land. And, instead of fleecing ’em, the I.W.W.
actually helps to put money into their
pockets. Probably it will be the same in this
current year. True, there have been a few
disastrous fires during October: but they and
all the talk about incendiarism and anti-con-
conscription riots and all the rest of it have
sent hundreds of business people to their in-
surance brokers seeking quotations for riot
and civil-commotion insurance, and thousands
of other people have gone to insurance offices
to get a few hundreds more on their stock
or premises and to inquire about the insur-
ance of profits. Probablv there hasn't been
a month in the last seven years when insur-
ance offices have been more rushed than they
were in October. And it seems to have been
good business for the offices, too, because the
danger of fire through riot and civil commo-
tion looks now as if it would be very well
covered for about 2 id. per cent, for six
months.
Most people have come to realise that the
old individualistic spirit isn’t what it was
cracked up to be; and nobody is ashamed
nowadays to come in with others to pool their
risks. Every year more of that is being-
done. That and the steadily-spreading faith in
Australian institutions is responsible for the
remarkable growth of business shown in the
next table :—-

Bo in 16 years premium income has almost
trebled. At the end of 28 years the co. had
achieved an income of £70,779 : in the next
16 years it had added £133,168. The business
certainly costs a bit more to get, partly
because it is of a different character, but
largely because insurance men are, as a rule,
better paid than they used to be. Neverthe-
less the underwriting profit—the proportion
of premiums left to the co. after paying-
claims and exes.—is a shade greater than it
was in 1900. Ago in and again we are fold
that Australia can’t do something or other as
cheaply as somebody else is doing it. Of
course, we can’t do it with a small turnover.
But make a start, and we shall be doing
better ail the while. Salaries are much higher
than they were even 16 years ago; yet, on
account of the splendid growth of the turn-
over, ‘‘directors and auditors’ fees, salaries
and petty exes.” (tins doesn’t include com-
mission) are now just under 7 p.c. of the
total premium income, whereas in 1900 they
were just over 7.5 p.c.
Notwithstanding the rapid growth of risks,
the co. has laid by enough of the profits to
keen them well protected. For every £3OO of
premium income, which is the best if not the
onlv indicator of risks, the co. has £lB4 of
capital and reserves. No better figure than
that can be reasonably asked for: it is far in
excess of the average of the best foreign
cos.. And there is this further advantage for
Australian shareholders: they can ascertain
almost exactly how those funds are invested
—an enormously important matter, of course.

Profits are not quite what they were just
before the war. At least, net profits are not.
Gross earnings are larger. But expenses
are up, partly because the bank is doing the
lair thing by the nearly-800 men of its staff
who have enlisted (with rather fewer
branches and agencies the exes, were £113,612
last half-year, as against £95,789 two years
ago), and partly because taxes are now
£12,563 as against £6082 for the correspond-
ing half of 1914. The volume of business
hasn’t been much affected. Deposits have
been cut into a bit. As at March, 1914, in
the happy, foolish days when we had our
heads in the sand, the National had
£4,517,470 of private deposits not bearing in-
terest and £0,984,943 fixed; now it has
£4 061,278 of the one and £5,543,258 of the
other. The harvest and wool clip money has
to come in, and that accounts for some of the
difference; for the rest, people have put their
idle surpluses into the war loans, and though
most of that money goes back to the banks,
it doesn t. all go back to the same banks.
Meantime the Governments have some of the
money on hand, and Government deposits
with this bank have increased in the two
years from £734,123 to £1,183,185. Hence,
without cutting into its liquid assets, the
National has been able to oblige its custom-
ers further, although no doubt many of the
later advances are in the nature of temporary
accommodation.
Coming to the past 12 months the move-
ments have been as follows:

In probing a bank these are among the things
one mostly wants to find out:—
Its power to stand the sudden shock of a run. This
depends chiefly on what liquid assets it has. The
National owes just over £4,100,00*0 of call money
and on notes, and it has £3,994,406 of liquid assets,
including - £2,362,909 in coin, Government notes and
cash at bankers. This is quite satisfactory. In any
case, so long as a bank behaves itself and has the
confidence of other banks, a run is nowadays almost
out of the question.
From the shareholders’ point of view, the safety of
the capital and the danger of calls. This depends
first upon the reserves. This bank’s share capital is
£1,498,220; and there is behind that £643,094 of
visible reserves, apart from the reserve for doubtful
debts. That is a solid backing.
The depositors and other creditors want to know
how they are protected. First, by the shareholders'
capital and reserves. In this case the bank owes
£11,651,871 and has £3,994,406 liquid. So it owes
£7,657,465, which it couldn’t pay out of liquid
assets, and this debt is represented by advances, pro-
perties, etc., valued at £9,556,216. The bank itself
requires a margin when it makes an advance; but the
creditors (depositors, etc.) have a margin of 30 p.c.
of values in addition.
As for the' future, this paper isn't prophe-
sying; but. assuming that there are hard
times ahead, it sees no reason, provided the
markets for our staples don’t collapse, why
banks should make any serious losses of prin-
cipal; and they will probably suffer much
less in profits than most people. It isn’t the
money-lender who is going to have the hard-
est time. In any case, there is a very com-
fortable margin of earnings to disappear
before the present dividend of the National
is jeopardised.

But that last line thrusts things a bit too
far into the shadow. Profits certainly were
only £21,383, but that was because the
directors paid the staff a special bonus of
£5556 at the beginning of the term and
voted £lOOO to the Officers’ Provident Fund
at the end of it. If special payments arc;
cut out the Colonial did just about as well
as usual last half-year. Expenses have
run up a little —everybody's expenses have
done that—but the gross profits after pro-
viding for interest are as good as they were
before the war. For the half-year to the
end of March. 1914. they totalled £68,323;
for the past half-year £68,692. There isn’t
as much foreign exchange business as there
was, especially for the rank and file of
banks; but there is a juicy commission on
what there is. Also there is a good deal
of local financing to be done. Hence
advances, etc., amount now to £3,277.655,
as against £2,845.215 at the last balance
prior to the war.
A little of this extra money advanced to
customers has come from increased deposits;
but most of it has come out of liquid assets.
The movement has been conspicuous during
the past 12 months. Here is a comparison :

Premises, etc. .. 197,443 196,447 Dec. 996
But the bite into liquid assets has not really
been as serious as it looks. As remarked
just now, the foreign exchange business
available for the banks other than the Com-
monwealth Bank has been severely reduced.
As at March, 3914, “Bills and remittances
in transitu and in London” represented
£500,822 of the so-called liquid resources.
On September 30 of this year the corres-
ponding total was only £381,063. So far
as coin, bullion and Australian notes are
concerned —the ammunition with which a
bank meets any sudden attack —the position
is actually a good deal stronger to-day than
it was just before the world’s pot boiled
over. Not that any respectable bank has
much to fear from a run in these days.
Banks know too well what an inflammable
substance credit is to allow a fire to get
thoroughly going amongst it.
The banks couldn’t do much for one
another in the ’9o’s because they were prac-
tically all in the same boat —they had taken
huge. foreign deposits, and they couldn’t
hurriedly realise the securities on which
those deposits had been advanced. Now, we
are again in danger of a large shrinkage in
the value of securities; but if the seasons
go right with us, it will be only a very tem-
porary shrinkage. How the banks will
suffer depends upon (1) whether their
advances have been prudent; (2) whether,
if they haven’t been very prudent and securi-
ties are thrown on their hands, they can
afford to nurse those securities. Really
the bank that isn’t using these years of
bogus prosperity to make itself very safe
has no right to be in the business. Com-
paratively few securities should therefore
be thrown on their hands. And it shouldn’t
be necessary to rush those on the market,
because, even if there are some depositors
who will want their money in a hurry, the
liquid assets in proportion to liabilities are
about three times greater than they were
just before the big boom broke in the '9o’s.
That is so far as this bank is concerned,
and its position isn’t exceptional.

for hard cash. There were £104,386 of dis-
closed reserves as at July 31. 1915. Appar-
ently the other £130,614 (to make up the
£235,000) has been grabbed either out of
profits made during the first half of the
year or by digging out internal reserves.
The old and the new capital compares this
way:—-
Old. New. Increase.
Paid up in money. . £57,500 £162,896 £105,396
Issued otherwise than
for money .. 462,500 697,500 235,000
Total ..£520,000 £860,396 £340,396
But there is £25,563 of cash still to be
paid on the new issue of shares, making the
total new capital got in £130,959.
The new capital consists of 200,000 7
p.c. cum. prefs., 90,000 9 p.c. 2nd prefs.,
230,000 10 p.c. 3rd prefs., and 365,959 ordi-
naries. After the preferences have been
satisfied the ordinaries get 7 p.c. Any
further dividends out of any further profits
which may be distributed are to be declared
simultaneously as follows: 3 p.c. to Ist
prefs. and 1 p.c. to 2nd prefs. (bringing
each up to 10 p.c.) and 1 p.c. to ordinaries
(bringing them up to 8 p.c.). After that all
further profits that may be distributed are
to go to ordinaries. Thus all the prefs.
stop at 10 p.c. The ordinaries can go on
for any distance past that. To pay the
prefs. their 10 p.c. means £52.000 a' year.
To pay the ordinaries thus far issued 8
p.c. means another £29,272. Thus every-
thing divided beyond £81,272 belongs to the
ordinaries; or put in another way, the latter
can’t get more than 8 p.c. until £82,272 has
been divided in the year. For the past half-
year the dividend is 10 p.c. all round, yet
only £36,197 is cut up. But that is because
184,536 of the ordinaries were entitled to
dividend for only one month.
Accounts were not issued for the previous
half-year; but it was part of the scheme of
reconstruction that for the six months to
the end of January a dividend equal to
that for the previous half should be paid.
What the profit was for the period this
paper doesn’t know. It has all been ab-
sorbed somewhere and somehow. For the
term just completed a profit of £68,063 was
shown ; but a special appropriation of
£30,000 has been made “for taxation pur-
poses.” Apparently it is not reckoned at
present healthy to either pay or show much
profit in excess of 10 p.c. on the capital.
In the table the small surplus left after
paying the 10 p.c. dividend all round is
referred to as nominal reserves. This is
because there is’still £lBO,OOO of the capital
represented by goodwill.

This co. is largely co-operative in character;
but it differs from the big concerns of Maori-
land in that it doesn’t go in extensively for
financing its shareholder-customers. Hence,
though its capita! is a mere £B5OO. its total
liabilities are under £45,000. Its own funds
(capital and reserves) are almost wholly re-
presented by store and other premises, sale-
yards and merchandise stock (including arti-
ficial manures) ; and the £45.000 or there-
abouts of debt is represented by accounts
owing and advances, apparently against goods
sent in for sale. There is generally some-
thing over £40,000 owing, and mostly the
eo. has to go to the bank for about £20,000
of it. But apparently shareholders who are
in the habit of receiving nominally 20 or 25
p.c. on their capital are not prepared to put
up a bit more to displace some which they
are no doubt borrowing for 5 p.c. or 6 p.c.
Well, it’s quite a matter of policy. The
wisdom of it all turns upon whether (1)
shareholders can make better use of the
money; (2) they can be sure that the bor-
rowed money won’t be asked for at incon-
venient times.

“The mill during the whole 12 months was
engaged in equipment work for the Defence
Department” ; and the year’s profits exhibited
in the table are shown after putting by £4500
to meet taxation. Yet, though the profit is
more than double what it was in 1933, which
was an extra-good year, there is no evidence
of extortionate prices. The trading receipts
in the past year were £80,628. so the profit
was about 14 p.c. In 3 913 the trading re

able to draw an easv 17 p.c. last year as
against G p.c. in 1913. This shows what turn-
over means. The mills have no doubt been
going day and night without interruption,
and the overhead charges in proportion to
output have thus been greatly reduced ; and
that means either bigger profits, or cheaper
goods, or both. Australian manufactured
goods have too often been dear simply
because the plant has been frequently idle,
earning nothing though costing money for
interest and supervision all the time. The
exceptional lift which this co. has had has
put it in a position to which most Australian
manufacturing cos. have climbed only after
laborious years. On account of its prosperity
it has been able to get in all the capital it
has needed, with the result that it has a
modern and well-equipped plant without
going into debt, and besides it can finance
most of its wool and other purchases out of
its own accumulated profits. And on top of
all that, it and the other Australian mills
have established such a reputation for
making hard-wear woollens that pretty well
every returned Billjim will be more or less
an unpaid commercial traveller on their
behalf.

Twelve months ago it was decided to restore
£-•>,000 of the capital which had been written
off as lost; and it was a reasonable thing to
do, because, as the table shows, the old pro-
perties on being sold had turned out better
than had been expected. Shareholders were
given the option of taking cash or shares, and
naturally, shares being at a premium, they
took shares. Thus far, 24,006 have been
issued and 904 are “held in reserve at pre-
sent.” Practically all the properties which
were thrown on the co.’s hands when the
} ictorian land boom collapsed have been real-
ised. The properties in possession are now
valued at only £lBl4, and most of them are
not old written-down properties, but new
foreclosures. Nothing much further in the
way of “profits on sales” can therefore be
expected. On the contrary, there may. be
some losses. Yet the position ought to be
sound. Here, first, are the figures :
1900. 1910. 1914. 1915. 1916.
Capital £98,150 £96,361 £125,000 £125,000 £149,006
Deposits 6,211 21.275 44,489 40,265 38,357
Other lia-
bilities 1,897 4,347 8,672 6,062 4 301

ures - 66,536 17,837 877 1,662 1 814
Advances 49,339 157,273 254,365 249,655 244 123
Other
assets 5,907 563 102 811 2,375
Note that there has been a steady reduction
of advances since September, 1914. This in-
dicates that the co. hasn’t been lending
violently. During the past couple of years
the actual loans and repayments have been as
follows:
Loans. Repayments.
4915 .. £38,220 £62,263
1916 •• .. 49,799 75,158
So the great bulk of the present advances are
comparatively old, upon which many repay-
ments have been made ; and no doubt,' judging
by these figures, the new loans have been
made on very conservative valuations. Of
course, while reducing risks, this means a
tendency to smaller profits, though that will
be partly counterbalanced by the higher
earning power of money. The co. is doing
well to be able to show so fair a margin
over the 10 p.c. dividend while risking so
comparatively little of other people’s money;
and it wouldn’t be possible but for (i)
economy of management and (2) the accu-
mulation of substantial reserves, very largely
out of the sale of unduly written-down pro-
perties.

Westralia is making strenuous efforts to
resurrect the dead. Dons? lists of deserted
shows, which once did well and which it is
claimed would now do so again, are bein»-
published. These lists show that Mount
Margaret has 107 deceased claims with a
credit of 16,3480 z. from 12,372 tons ; Broad
Arrow 46 with 27,6430 z. from 64,075 tons •
and North Coolgardie 160 with 13,7750 z!
from 14,530 tons. A few individual cases of
mines with a blighted career are cited. Pad-
dington Consols, which once employed several
hundred men, was shut down when its
owner, the Standard Exploration Co., was
smashed by the Whittaker Wright collapse.
Inbutors afterwards took thousands of
ounces out of its upper workings, but its
A:>wer levels, where a big reef, value un-
stated, is alleged to exist, lias never been
touched. The fact that a party of working
miners is doing well out of a neighboring
resurrected show is urged as a reason why
it should be given another chance. Hills
Proprietary, at Murrin, on the Mount Mar-
garet field, was thrown up after turning out
over £200,000, and speculators are asked to
remember that it is situated in a locality
noted for its rich veins. The now almost-
deserted Yerilla district, where the Queen of
the Earth, an early-day sensation, lies sleep-
ing, is also instanced.

From Westonia :—-
Someone in Melbourne has underwritten Edna May
Deeps £lO,OOO of 8 p.c. debentures. Debenture-
holders will have the right to convert within nine
months into shares at 255. The mine will require to
reveal some g-ood developments to keep the security
good. The very limited ore available at and above
485 ft. level may be sufficient to meet expenditure at
that level, but serious operations actually commence
below that point. Total liabilities exceed £so‘oo,
so, even with the funds raised by debentures, the eo.
will have comparatively little cash for development.
Edna May Central is looking better. The eastern
leg of the New Reef at the 300 ft. level, running
towards Consolidated, will pay to work, and this fact
is as pleasing as unexpected. The prospects of the
New Reef at No. 4 level are distinctly good, and the
main shaft is to be sunk to open it up. Generally,
the mine is convalescing, and is now ably handled.
Edna May’s No. 4 level is opening up excellently,
but the ore reserves in Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are now on the
fine side. Before No. 5 is opened up there is an
expensive crosscut and plat to take out, and heavy
water may be met with. Then the big granite bar
will displace considerable ore at No. 5 level. The
richer portion of. the reef seems to become shorter
each succeeding level. Edna May possesses a fine
shoot of ore, but the dyke disclosed at No. 4
seems likely to wither it. There will be many divi-
dends, but not so many as looked likely before the
dyke intruded.
Has Consolidated struck a repetition of the Edna
May and' Central new lode deposits ? It looks like it.
Very little work has been done to date, but so far
everything looks well. Of course, the discovery may
turn out to be only a bulge of quartz, but at
present supporters have for the first time in the
co.’s existence every reason to be satisfied. ,
With liabilities of about £2OOO, assurances
of ore ranging from 15dwt. to over 20z., and
promises of early dividends, New Bodding-
-ton (W.A.) starts crushing in December. No
definite estimate of tonnage has so far been
giv en, but at the first half-yearly meeting
held in Ivalgoorlie the other day shareholders
were told vaguely that apart from a rich
patch, or two there. was enough stone in sight
to keep the mill going for some time. Share-
holders were further assured that things were
“all right” ; and they will need to be, other-
wise the local and Adelaide crowd in the
show will understand what holding scrip in a
weakly financed gold-mining venture gener-
ally means.
. Distress signals have been hoisted by Adel-
aide Enterprise Syndicate, which is work-
ing a small low-grade block on the side of
Hannan s Reward Hill, Ivalgoorlie. Recent
yields have been disappointing, and the mill
has been shut down pending the opening up of
another level, where better values are antici-
pated. The co. is handicapped by the cost
of water, big cos. on the field being supplied
by the Government at Is. 6d. per 1000 gal-
lons, while Adelaide Enterprise and other
struggling leaseholders have to pay 7s. Gd.
Provision is made under the regulations to
supply water at the Is. 6d. rate when the
grade of the ore falls to about 10s. per ton,
but the concession is valueless, as stone of
that value wouldn’t be worth handling even
if the water was got for nothing.
Worked wholly by tributors. North Ival-
(W.A.) in its Jast year produced about
£BOOO,. out of which the co. got £632 in
royalties. Some good crushings were
obtained, hut all were small and isolated.
Operations are mostly confined to the
oxidised workings where values range from
idvvt. to 9dwt. The co. wants tributors to
do more prospecting in the deeper levels, but
as this would entail a lot of costly dead
work they are not inclined to oblige the co.
* * * *
Inquiries for asbestos have been made in
vVestralia through the High Commissioner.
He wants supplies for the English market
The best-known deposit in the State is at
I llbarra; but the narrowness of the vein
hardness of country and difficulties of access
and transport make the working of the
mineral too costly. Several other occur-
rences have been reported from time to time,
but they have not been good enough to
bother about. The Government offers to
assist prospectors willing to look for better
deposits.
Tributors have lately done well taking
out pillars and small blocks left in the old
Black Range mine at Sandstone (W.A.).
So far 300 tons have been extracted and
treated for about £lBOO worth of gold.
According to local contentions the mistake
made by the co., which lately took over the
Pinnacles, was in not securing the ground
now held by the Black Range West. Had
this been done—and it would have entailed
only a small outlay—the “short-sighted
directors would, it is declared, have been
able, with a plant that should have been
scrapped six years ago,” to pay another
quarter of a million in divs.
During the first nine months of this year
1° aiines at Charters Towers crushed 25,536
tons for £122,587; but apart from some
liquidation distributions there hasn’t been
much doing in dividends. Brilliant Ex-
tended crushed 5228 tons for £28.850, Bonnie
Dundee 2908 tons for £15,560, Clark’s 1346
tons for £11,130. The Bonnie cleaned up
a crushing of 530 tons for £lBl7 this month.
Clark s isn’t making much of a splash be-
cause the reef is small and exploration has
to be kept going below No. 6 level. The
only development of importance on the
Moonstone reef has been the sinking of a
winze by the New Queen Cross below No. 6
lei el. btone from this winze has contained
heavy mineral; but, generally speaking, the
Moonstone is unreliable. That is why the
Papuan, after paying a few dividends, is so
quiet. Rich shoots of prill ore are difficult
to find, but the Board is sinking on the off
chance of another discovery.

Mt. Lyell reckons that it can get all the
water power it needs for the electrolytic
treatment of the Hercules-Rosebery ores
within 10 miles of Zeelian, where the works
are likely to be erected. Surveys are now in
progress.

Tasmania’s newest gold find, at Long
1 lams, still looks good. The first assays, of
stuff taken from the spur, showed over 6oz.
A tunnel has been put in below the spur
and samples tried by the Government assayer
gave from Ooz. to 4oz, Whether they were
fair samples The Bulletin doesn’t 'know ;
hut there is evidently some rich stuff there. ’
G.D.M.”: \V hy is it the Mines Depart-
ments of the various States regard gold,
silver, copper and coal as the minerals
entitled to their special care, to the exclusion
of the rare metals of higher value and equal
importance? For example, Victoria, vear in
and year out, wastes £30,000 in subsidies to
gold and coal cos. and to parties of working
miners. No attempt is made by any Minister
to assist a co. to open up a molybdenite mine
or an antimony show; yet both these rare
metals are in urgent demand not only for war
purposes but in the iron industries. Why
should not every State devote money to try-
ing to establish mines for the rare metals?
It could be done quite easily.

“Erl Jass” on mine dust prevention :
Re “Paddymelon” on vacuum-cleaners and mine-
dust. The remarks of “K.M.” (B. 26/10/T6) are
supported by the findings of more than a dozen Royal
Commissions in various parts of the world.. Rock-
drills are the most prolific dust-producers, and the
detached jet is the simplest and most efficient method
of dealing with the evil, sprays generally making
the atmosphere too humid. The treatment of dust
and fumes from “firing-or.t” has not so far received
the same attention, and since fumes reduce the re-
sisting power of the human constitution and enable
the dust to perform its deadly work more quickly, the
matter is of great importance. The remedy is simple,
and consists of either a water-spray of the common
or garden variety, or efficient ventilation. Under
most Australian mining conditions, however, water is
scarce. Perhaps the complete water-supply scheme
will therefore need modification, and I can recom-
mend nothing better than the installation of an
efficient system of ventilation, natural or preferably
consisting of exhaust fans which will deliver the
fumes and dust-laden mine air to the surface. The
cost of installing either a water system or
ventilation or both may seem prohibitive, but just
consider these two facts: (1) In the Rand mines,
with no dust prevention, the average life of a rock-
driller was from seven to nine years. (In certain
cases I have proved the same in Australia.) (2)
Under a Workmen's Compensation Act a negligent
mining co. has to pay about £2OO for a dead miner.
Therefore the average cost per year per dead miner
to the negligent co. is over £2O, so that the
commercial aspect of the installation is self-evident.
Speaking- generally, Australian mines are slow in
adopting dust-preventive measures. There are, how-
ever, some shining examples. Many coal-mines
have adopted ventilation systems. Broken Hill mines
have water systems, notably B. IT. South, the best-
equipped mine in Australia ; and Lyell over 10 years
ago went through “Iv.M.’s” list of sprays, masks,
sponges, etc., and settled down to the water-supply
system with half-inch hoses and one-eighth-inch jets,
exhaust fans being used with success on long, unven-
tilated drives to deal with fumes. The nearest
approach to the vacuum cleaner I know of was at
Lyell. There was an exhaust fan in a long drive,
the intake to suction pipe being a large funnel
occupying one-third of the area of the drive; and I
can testify to its effectiveness.
“Paddymelon”: Working at Broken Hill
some years ago I was struck by the waste
of heat in the process of sintering the slimes,
and made a sketch of an idea for raising
steam with it. I submitted this to the mana-
ger ; he turned it down for a reason. I
offered to give a month’s pay to the hospital
if I was in error, the chief chemist to be the
judge. No go—he would have none of it!
Later the co. sent me to the smelters at
Pirie. I saw there enough heat wasted at
the roasting furnace to run all the machinery
twice over. I wonder if it’s still going up
the chimney? Now, if we are ever going to
do anything big this kind of thing will have
to stop. Why, they even imported sulphur
to make acid for the flotation process, when
only a mile or two away sulphur fumes were
polluting the atmosphere. The Huns did not
waste much of the heat or fumes when they
got our stuff.

In New York 70 p.c. wolfram has been
selling at £2BO per ton. or £4 per unit.
Unfortunately our Australian producers
have to be satisfied with much less: here
the price seldom exceeds 50s. per unit, which
means £175 per ton for <0 p.c. concentrates,
under present conditions there is no incen-
tive to develop our 4 p.c. wolfram deposits
simply because the maximum price is only
about 20s. pei' ton after allowing for losses
m milling. Mt. Carbine (Q.) is our best
producer. It has been recovering about 2
p.c. and gave most of the £2370 worth of
the mineral which the district reported last
month.

WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, November 6, 1916.
My Dear Akim,—
■ Nothing doing, not even a big battalion
party, last week. The Cup exodus, though
without the usual flourish, was consider-
able. And this hamlet takes one bar rest
after the Referendum.
Premier Holman, whose inclinations lie
towards art, gave a party to the Gonsalez
principals. With one or two exceptions, none
of these ungroomed songsters have any notion
of form or color as applied to clothes. One
lady, with little curls dangling over drab-
white neck-gear, had on a kind of sailor-cut
blouse and skirt. On tne whole, it was a
quaint party that supped at the Australia,
and the coiffures suggested the liayfield before
the rakes come along.
Sydney said good-bye to the Gonsalez
singers in a cyclone of flowers, sweets and
bottles of Italian wine. The wine, festooned
with decorative ribbons, was carefully
handed over the footlights—this side up
with care. As a matter of fact, the old
custom of throwing posies is almost defunct.
Broken flowers are poor tributes, and an
obliging usher usually hands the blooms t<>
the leading gentleman to pass round. Miss
Gonsalez was loaded with blooms after the
curtain fell on “Cavalleria.” Miss Russ,
the contralto with the flashing black eyes,
got her share of the goods. And the youth-
ful tenor Lois had a laurel wreath to go on
with. But the great uproar came when the
audience had to part with Scamuzzi and
Balboni at the end of “Pagliacci,” and the
tenor flung out one of the long reels of rib-
bon that mark the usual good-bye on a
wharf. The Opera House finished the even-
ing with a rainbow web spun from gallery to
stage. When the song-birds come back Syd-
ney will love tiie best of them as warmly as
ever. As for the others—-well, the soprano
department, to begin with, needs an infusion.
The Edith Cavell concert was organised
by Mrs. Verbrugghen. The chief object
was to add to the funds of the memorial
Rest Home for Nurses, and a good crowd
flocked to the Town Hall for the event.
When the vice-regal party—Lady Helen and
a big official train—hashed up, the army
of nurses was mobilised as a guard of
honor. The long Noah’s Ark procession—
the Cullens in the forefront —had the red-
caped sisters to lead the way. In every
other nook and cranny civilian Nightingales
were after cash in return for favors ren-
dered —programmes given by Farmer’s,
flowers, etc.
The audience stood while the Sydney
Madrigal Society softly sang “The Death
Croon.” Almost as solemn was the unusual
appearance of conductor Joe Bradley, with-
out his orchestra, steering his way to the
piano stool. Something tremendous was
expected from this severe critic of local
musicians. But a very moderate perform-
ance of Chopin’s heavyweight “Fantasia”
was the result.
Official secretary Eliot is taking his many
inches back to the Pacific. He only joined
the G.G.’s staff as a locum teriens, and Iverr-
Pearse returns to the sub-regal billet shortly.
Eliot is a commissioner of something, and
looks too intelligent for a permanent .job at
handing round the tea-cake.
The usual old strike at Newcastle won’t
help the big charities’ carnival which the
pit-mouth city is bringing to a head. His
Ex. isn’t likely to get so far from home for
the opening, but Eldest Daughter may smile
on the occasion.
Apnendicitis gives some of our soldiers at
the Front the brief spell that they won’t
take until they are forced to. Young David,
in the healing branch, took 16 days off duty
with the nuisance. Then he got back to the
firing-line, where father —Sydney’s gallant
old Professor—is sapping and mining.
Some time ago the gentle sisters in charge
of the Hospice for the Dying (Darlinghurst)
fell amongst rogues and vagabonds, who
financially stripped and robbed them of
£12,000. Portion of this money was eventu-
ally reclaimed with the help of the Law. But
there’s still a big hole in the Hospice cash-
box. Public sympathy took the form of a
concert in Paddington Town Hall the other
night. But that’s only a curtain-raiser. The
big effort will be in December. You can’t
wipe £5006 off the slate in one evening.
The Naval people are rounding up per-
formers for their concert in St. James’s Hall,
at the end of this month. Proceeds go to the
fund for the widows and orphans of the
Jutland sea-fight.
Dean Talbot told the A.M.C. ladies some-
thing about the grim tragedy of war as he
saw it in Gallipoli. It was the first annual
meeting of the A.M.C. Comforts Fund, with
Professor Andy Stuart’s lady in the chair.
Yet the butterfly brigade catches the Cup
fever as usual, and buys glad rags wherein
to see Wolaroi beat the Derby favorite! Not
that they’re much loss to the hard-worked
women in Red Cross depots.
“I put up a third star on each shoulder
last week,” a Sydney boy writes home to
his sister, “and it almost feels like being in
the Milky Way.”
Colonel Luscombe, of the R.A.A., has been
straining at the leash for two years. Like
many other Permanent men he was sternly
ordered to stay at home and mind the guns.
Now the countersign has been given, and the
tall, delicate-looking Luscombe goes to
France. Before joining the Artillery I fancy
he carried a surveyor’s kit up-country. An
only son has been at one of the Fronts ever
since the scrimmage began.
Here’s luck to
another Australian
girl! They have a
winning way with
them when there’s
music in the air,
as you may have
noticed. R e n e
Maxwell, of Syd-
ney, is the latest
to pile up scholar-
ships in London.
Last week’s cables
mentioned that she
had just collected
the Ileilbut, worth
£l5O, at the Guild-
hall. Before that
she had two from
the Guildhall and
one from the
Royal Academy. Rene was the young
soprano who sang in the gallery while the
goddesses were putting in a long wait before
a Quinlan opera performance. The ringing
thrush-like notes interested Quinlan, and
brought the girl an offer to join the co. But
the claw of Destiny dragged her to the
Royal Academy of Music instead. Sydney
gave her a farewell concert in the Town
Hall in April, 1914.
The invitation matinee to Brieux’s “Dam-
aged Goods” brought an eager crowd of par-
sons, a few actors taking a ’busman’s holiday,
Chief Secretary Black (who gives the Un-
pleasantness his official blessing), Inspector-
General Mitchell (of the Police) and a
sprinkle of the press. Upstairs the gallery
was packed with ’Varsity undergrads. Dr.
Arthur, M.L.A., who has been one of the local
sponsors of the Moral Lesson (if that’s the
incentive that drives Percy to take his
Girlie to the theatre), was in the audience.
Also, other politicians and their ladies. But
the shining lights of the medical profession
didn’t seize this chance to see the stage steal
their thunder. For one thing, doctors don’t
usually look for “shop” when they get an
hour off. And in any case they would claw
the air at the best advertising line of the
matinee—a pencil attached to a slip of paper
on which those present were invited to
record their “impressions.”
Mrs. W. F. Buchanan, of Killarney station,
is still in England. She is backing daughter
Noelie’s efforts to amuse wounded Kangaroos.
As I told you the Australian girl drives her
own car with a daily ballast of sick soldiers.
From a friend who helped at the tea-
drinking : —■
Scene, an afternoon At Home at a well-known
Government House in—but you must guess where.
Tinned milk is the usual infliction; but to-day the
cups of the guests are filled with something thinner
and fresher, and everyone is taking a second cup—it
is not often that one gets real milk in Blanldand.
Gent. Help, pleased and astonished, to the
attendant “boy”: “Hullo? Where you getem this
one?”
Hoy : “Along village, sir.”
Help: “He milk belong bulimacovv?”
(Guests listening, with interest —one is interested
in small things in Pacific colonies.)
Boy: “No, sir.”
Help: “What name milk?”
Boy (with a proud smile) : “Milk belong pig, sir.”
Imagine the feelings of the guests !... .And of the
host!. ... And, after all, it was only goat. But the
Blankland native is hopelessly at sea as to the names
of European animals.
Captain Jameson. R.E., is engaged to
Gladys Elkington. She is the eldest daughter
of the A. G. Elkingtons, formerly of Hawkes
Bay (M.L.).
Friends of handsome Gladys Fuller that
used to be—Mrs. Stanley Coward for the last
10 months or so —were shocked to hear of
her death last week. The funeral left the
kirk, St. Stephen’s, in which she was
married with a clang of joybells so short a
time ago. George Fuller took Dr. Timing
by special train to the home near Bourlce—
but there was no hope. Sympathy and letters
of condolence flow in to husband and parents.
Walwyn Laidley, daughter of the Shep-
heard Laidleys, is now engaged to Dr. George
Macintosh, R.N. He’s a brother of the popu-
lar Leura doctor.
Edna Sly, pretty younger daughter of Dr.
George, is wed in England this week. The
young man’s name is Cooper, and I under-
stand ho wears khaki.
The tableaux and theatricals for French
war orphans brought in about £l66 —so far
as the present count goes. The ex-students
and youngsters at Rose Bay Convent got up
the afternoon party. Three hundred or so
friends trammed or motored or tramped to
the big grey school that stands on the green
brow of Rose Bay.
“The Vagabonds,” an amateur theatrical
society, are amongst the most persistent of
the modest money-spinners for war funds.
Now they’ve taken a fallen soldier’s daughter
to their friendly bosom. They’ve sworn to
raise the cash “to maintain and endow her
with a commercial education,” so that she
can help her mother and younger sisters.
Hence another Vag. playlet in the Repertory
Theatre. A satisfactory audience rolled up
to Saturday night’s effort. The chief feature
of the evening was a three-act comedy called
“Ann.” Ann (Ruby Coxhead) is a ’Murkan
lady journalist who runs up a fire-escape and
enters the hero’s flat by a top window. Her
object is to get the interview which the. shy
hero, a novelist (portrayed in rather blurred
English bv Hugh Jennings), has bashfully re-
fused. The lady’s evening dress (emerald-
green gauze over white shimmer) and “cheek”
win the blushing novelist’s inky hand. The
fire-escape and the interview are merely in-
terludes.
The Demon Drink was quietly swallowed
by the Demon Drapery last week. Farmer’s
owned all but one corner of a city block with
a frontage to three streets—Pitt, Market and
George. Roberts’s Hotel had its cask planted
firmly on the corner of George and Market;
now Farmer’s have rolled it off with a cheque
the giant size of which is not stated.
Two of Melbourne’s much-occupied women
are here Red Crossing. Dr. Edith Barrett,
half-sister of the contentious Dr. James, wan-
ders round our block in off moments, regard-
less of frills, and on flat heels. Kate
Gardiner, who pioneered the estate-agency
business for women,, also finds friends in our
playgrounds.
Miss Collisson, who toured N. S. Wales
with reasons for voting “Yes” in her peggy-
bag, got a clinching “final” from France
on the last day of her strenuous cam-
paign. The Neutral Bay girl, who is con-
nected with the ’Varsity staff, passed on the
bad news of her brother’s death, “Killed in
action,” with the stern query: “Who will
take his place?”
News comes that young Cameron Sharp, a
tall S’Australian, who was wounded in the
Romani fight, has won his commission after
two years’ active service with the Light
Horse. An anxious little fiancee, Joyce
Kettlewell, is waiting for the end of the war
to welcome her hero home.
The face that
looks at you here is
much younger than
the learned specta-
cles would suggest.
It belongs to the
only woman in the
Verbrugghen string
quartet. Though
we want to break
the habit of getting
everything from
somewhere else,
especially when
there is a good
salary tied to it,
Sydney is recon-
ciled to the Con-
servatorium four.
They set the pace,
and quick-witted
Australian students won’t lose by their pre-
sence here. Little Jenny Cullen —a mere
handful to look at —is a brilliant violinist. At
a symphony concert, not so long ago, she was
the star of the afternoon. At 12 the girl,
who is frae Glasgie, ye'ken (this is to air
my knowledge of dead languages), was draw-
ing her bow under the tuition of Verbrug-
ghen. How well he taught her, and how
plastic was the raw material, was proved
when the student became a professor at the
Glasgow Athenaeum School of Music.
Thorough is the word that makes the Jenny
of Sydney Conservatorium as earnest a
student of the Master as ever she was.
Before packing up for Australia the accom-
plished young fiddler played in a series of
orchestral concerts at Petrograd. That was
before it changed its name—about four years
ago—and I daresay the crowned heads were
amongst those also present. The photo is
by May Moore.
The Domain Anzac Buffet started with
death in its face. Who can forget the sorry
sight of our soldiers refused admittance on
the opening day, unless they left their
mothers, sisters and other fellows' sisters
outside? “Ladies not admitted” killed the
spirit of the place, though cakes, sandwiches
and tea have kept its body alive for a few
months of agony. Now the president throws
up the sponge, and follows medical advice to
take a complete rest. Some of the com-
mittee are also sick of the business, and it is
pretty certain the end will be: “This bullet
is under entirely new management.”
The 2nd D.A.C. and 22nd Howitzer Bri-
gade committee has a shop open in Castle-
reagh street every Friday. You can’t miss it
if you walk up Moore-street. An office has
been lent for the purpose, and the trade is
mostly in jam, eggs and flowers. On the first
Friday afternoon they didn’t expect to clear
much, but there were almost as many pounds
in the till as shillings had been hoped for.
One old citizen paid £1 for a pot of jam—
because his son had just got a D.S.O. in
France. Not satisfied with that he flung 10s.
to a. D.A.C. lady for a posy of flowers. S<>
the committee put up its shutters in joyous
mood.
The Women’s Handicrafts workers are
going to try their luck in the Education
galleries. Stitchery, their strongest asset,
will be cunningly put together for the Christ-
mas gift season. Early in December.
The Verbrugghen orchestral concert
attracted more than the irritable Cult on
Saturday afternoon. Even empty seats here,
and there didn’t leave oceans of space in the
Conservatorium. On a sultry summer day,
with a real storm in the middle of the
orchestra’s mimic thunder that crackles
around Elgar’s “Sea Pictures,” the music
hostel is a stifling barn if you happen to
sit in the loft. The wretched ventilation is
only another grievance against these Gothic-
stables, with a late Georgian drawbridge and
a Sarah Ann finish in its roof. Lady Helen,
with little A.D.C. Haskett Smith at her
heels, came along for the first and better half
of the programme. Verbrugghen has whipped
up the orchestra he commands till in its swift
improvement it has lost its earlier form.
The Mozart Symphony, “Jupiter,” was its
best performance to date. There were no
ragged edges, and the perspiring Henri had
to double up to the applause. In the “Sea
Pictures” good-looking Manie Punch sup-
plied a rich contralto to voice the words.
Amongst the 40 who left by the Medina to
tackle munition-making in England went
Alfred Shea. He is a dark-browed young
tenor who used to warble such ditties as
“She is Far from the Land” to dead-slow
music.
The summer brings the loveliness of
organdi muslin out of some secret hiding
place. Not for many Decembers has this
diaphanous stuff had the innings it is getting
this year. The obvious reason is the return
of the frilled petti. When tube frocks were
in they had to be fairly non-transparent.
Now the bolster-case makes room for the Girl
in Flounces, and everyone—except the hum
dress’ —feels cooler.
The Old Gold and Silver Committee (depot
62 Hunter-street) wishes you to drop in and
look at its wares. You can buy Alfonso a
Christmas present, and by doing so add to
a war fund.
The versatile Dr. It. 11. Todd represents
the B.M.A. on the newly-formed Board that
is to sit on the young man who claims ex-
emption because he isn't strong enough to
face the foe. The little doctor is a barrister
besides, and an amateur musician of note.
He was an Oxford undergrad, for a start.
Professor Randal Woodhouse, well known
here amongst the long-haired profession,
came back the other day. And apparently
he means to stay, after a long absence in
Britain. He’s been one of the professors of
singing at the Royal Irish Academy since he
left Sydney.
Battleplanes are progressing favorably if
slowly. Maorilauder Alma Baker, recently
of the Malay States, is still behind the Aus-
tralian Air Squadron struggle. But it’s
been hard to rush the subscriptions up.
Mrs. Suttor, wife of the 7th Light Horse
Major, is now in London, after strenuous
Red Cross work in Egypt.
Lucky little Nestor Griffiths, one of the
most eager war-helpers here, is off soon for
a jaunt to India as the guest of Mrs. Nita
Walker Verney. Captain Verney, our one-
time Aide, is now at the same job with
Viceroy Chelmsford, owing to several wounds
received in the trenches which sent him home
to his wife. Mrs. Verney, who is Eadith
Walker's favored niece, means to ask a batch
of girl-bachelors to stay with her. She has
begun with Miss Griffiths.
Artist Dora Measou has been doing ser-
vice as a policewoman in England. Accord-
ing to a correspondent she got an unex-
pected “Yes” when she asked a_ soldier in a
street row the usual “Will you come away
quietly?”
Have you noticed the check that is abroad
in the land? Any size, of course, and gener-
ally the smaller the woman the larger the
pattern. As a rule, it consists of heavy slabs
of black laid on here and there.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

DYSPEPTICS SHOULD AVOID DRUGS
AND MEDICINES.
TRY A LITTLE MAGNESIA INSTEAD.
Some people instinctively shut their eyes
to danger, and it may be that instinct, or
custom, or habit causes dyspeptics to take
drugs, patent foods and medicines, artificial
digestants, etc. But closing the eyes does
not banish the danger, and it is certain that
neither drugs nor medicines possess the
power to destroy the acid in the stomach,
which is the underlying cause of most forms
of indigestion and dyspepsia. They may
give temporary relief, but ever-increasing
quantities must be taken, and all the time
the acid remains as dangerous as ever.
Physicians know this, and that is why the
usual advice now given to sufferers from
digestive and stomach trouble is, “Just get
some bisurated magnesia from your chemist
and take half a teaspoonful in a little water
immediately after every meal. This will
instantly neutralise the acid and stop food
fermentation, thus enabling you to enjoy
hearty meals without experiencing the least
pain or unpleasantness afterwards.” — Advt.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, November 6, 1916.
My Dear Yarrie, —
When Derby Day dawned, Collins-street
felt its pulse and found that it had the old
complaint again. Socially, October was
dead, and few preparations had been
made in advance for Cup Week. But,
after all, the fine dresses, dances and
dinners are only extras, and horses will
gallop even if Mrs. Toorak stays at home in
sackcloth and curling-pins. So the big
hotels buzzed as usual and the motors
whirred as if there were no wars.
The lunch parties under the Flemington
elms were jolly, hurriedly-arranged spreads,
with the motor-hamper and the family help in
attendance. There was not a single vice-regal
on hand to clear a plate at'the stewards’
table. Cocked-liat jobs weigh heavily at
times. The big crowd who did enjoy the
day had their consciences lightened by the
whole-hearted patriotism of the V.R.C., which
was donating all the profits to patriotic
funds. It made the visitors feel that they
were at least as noble as the patriots who
eat for the good of the soldiers. Khaki was
everywhere, and I counted three generals.
(All generals have crossed-swords on their
shoulder-straps. Never mistake them for
scissors, for there is no knife-grinding
corps.) Surgeon-General Williams was one of
the trio. He is on furlough at present.
General Hughes, almost rid of his limp,
seemed cheerful. General Stanley, looking
younger than he is, towered like a tall gum-
tree in scarlet-trimmed khaki.
The Tyes had a tea-party after Lavendo’s
win. Mrs. Tye wore a hat made of cocoanut
fibre. Bachelor Dr. Gould was with them
in the loveliest grey suit I ever saw, with
inch-wide stripes. The Coopers were de-
lighted when their Andelosia ran into a place
and threatened to win the last race. Ande-
losia wore white bandages on his forelegs
and was not expected to perform so well.
Mrs. Cooper covered up a lovely frothy cham-
pagne dress with a comfy seal coat, and Miss
Cooper’s colors were blue iinder her warm
race-coat. Seaton, from Sydney, was not a
bit surprised at the easy Derby win of
Wolaroi. The sun was shining when the
orange jacket and lemon cap came up, blazing
like a rich sunset, for the presentation; but
the start of the race was delayed a minute
or two while a big rain-squall passed over.
The dresses came out with the sun, and the
bracing breeze acted the part of a faithful
scene-shifter pushing the clouds over the
horizon.
Mrs. Eric Connolly was buried in ermine
furs and wore a hat built by a Sydney mil-
liner. It had a spider-web crown with a
glittering gold-green fly caught in the meslies.
Mrs. GeoS. Syme’s parasol looked as if it
had been sprinkled with confetti when the
silk pattern got drenched. Her frock was
the smartest on record—a belted ivory cr£pe-
de-chine coat over black and white striped
silk and a big black straw hat about a yard
and a half in circumference. This head-
umbrella had to be bent before she could get
into her motor. Mrs. Leslie Stuart wore
navy serge of the trickiest cut. It had enor-
mous pleated pockets to port and starboard,
and her hat had all sails set. Dr. Barry
Thompson, one of the busy military medical
specialists of the hour, assisted his wife
with a jolly lunch party. Mrs. Thompson’s
check suit was faced with blue cloth in a
military fashion, and she perched a fine
blue turban on her brown hair with a pink
rose set in the bows. Mrs. Russell Gatt had
her navy blue silk heavily embroidered in
colored worsted—one of the newest ideas.
The little Fenner girl wore pink kitten rib-
bon round her hat. Mrs. Eccles wore a
black saucer upside down on her head, and
daughter Muriel had glacd frills from the
waist down. Mrs. Tom Patterson’s coat
flared from the armpits. One of the Clarke
girls startled the lawn promenaders with
rifle-green cloth turned up about her ears.
The Peterson youth, in pale lavender-grey
and a stoop, was her escort at that moment.
Mrs. Sam Mackay wore a baby-garland of
flowers on her hair and looked slim in neat
navy tailoring. Mrs. Billy Williams was
one of the check brigade. Mrs. Archie
Whyte showed a sunset of auburn hair from
a filmy tulle hat and snorted the newest
rifle-green clothes. Mrs. Mills did not come
to town for the meeting, but got in half
a ton of wool for soldiers’ socks.
George Buchanan sported the Derby win-
ner’s colors and paraded in a vivid orange-
colored raincoat. Mrs. Buchanan had a
green orange bobbing on the roof of her
hat. Some important dame walked unrecog-
nised by reason of a mole-colored balloon
which enveloped her body and a shrieking
pink ostrich that hid her face and neck.
The Falkiner women put some gay clothes--
into the picture. One was a white and
black poster „ effect and another a hand-
painted black glace vision.
Melbourne felt like a drowsy parrot under
the garden hose when four inches of rain
fell on some parts of it within an hour.
Shopping dames suddenly found themselves
either barred in by hail or driving along a
river up to the axles of their motors. The
everlasting tea bibbers got rained on even
in the gilded bosom of the new Vienna. The
flood waters snaked round their feet and
forced them to climb on chairs while work-
men bored holes through the new carpets
and the floor to let the curse escape. The
only cafe occupants undisturbed were the
new marble ladies who stand up to the waist
in corn.
Children and flowers made Friday’s street
collections irresistible. The school-children
had been growing blooms in anticipation for
many months. They had stands all over
town and at every corner there was a group
of youngsters singing in shrill voices. When
they got going on a song their eyes were fixed
on the heavens, and the wind blew unheeded
through their mops of hair, it was a great
improvement on the usual street appeal by
singing theatricals. The youngsters simply
coined money.
They had cute ideas on salesmanship, too.
A prominent clubman walked into his retreat
decorated with a gorgeous buttonhole that
was evidently designed for a giant’s coat. A
boy had bailed him up and said “Miss So-
and-So made this bookey ’speshully for you,”
and of course the flattered man had to buy it.
I fear the noble lad used the same happy
formula over and over again. I am told
he also crept into a Toorak garden, picked a
bunch of freezias and carried them to the
front door of the house, where he sold them
for half a crown for the Patriotic Fund.
The G.-G. came back to Melbourne on
Thursday and returned on Friday to Sydney.
It would break the vice-regal sportsman's
heart to be in race-mad Melbourne when the
Cup he put from him was bubbling at Flem-
ington. He might be tempted to go and
watch the races over the fence with a peri-
scope. By the way, a' jeweller of George-
street, Sydney, had a periscope race-glass on
view quite 10 years ago. It was a novelty
then, and was designed for short racegoers
hemmed in bv crowds.
Great preparations are being made for
November 18. the day on which the Stanleys
hand over Government House for a fete in
aid of the Society for the Assistance of
French Mothers and Children. The vice-
regals won’t be able to go to bed early that
evening, for the committee has decided to
keep the show open until 10 o’clock.
Melba and a small party, shepherded by
the indispensable Tommy Cochran, paid a
surprise visit to the Tivoli on Thursday
evening and occupied the managerial pen.
Despite the fact that the party sat well for-
ward and balanced a box of sweets the size
of a dress basket on the ledge of the box, no
sign was made by the house that it was
aware of the presence of the Voice. Had the
visitor been Dorothy Brunton now !
Hehnessy is Mayor of Mel bourne for the
fifth time, so he and his dame want all
(approved) hands to roll up at the Town
Hall on Thursday evening, November 9. The
people who make music and the other people
who make bouquets to throw at them are
glad, for the Mayoress is good to the war-
distressed musicians, and her decorative
schemes are always lavish and expensive.
Town has been dotted with the little red
pompoms perched on top of the caps of visit-
ing French sailors. Artists look wistfully at
those red dots—they recall past shows and
sales that are no more.
Adelaide’s tale-telling:—
This lias been a week of “penny” collections for the
chief baby charities —a reproach to the State, organ-
ised by the League of Loyal Women. A Child’s Wel-
fare Exhibition was simultaneously run by some well-
meaning enthusiasts. Lady Galway, who has taken a
keen interest in the general scheme, left it her special
benediction before she departed to Sydney, and ill
her absence Premier Vaughan uttered the usual plati-
tudes unsuitable to the occasion. These, of course,
contained no hint as to when the Government pro-
posed to provide for the health and welfare of the
future citizen out of taxation instead of leaving the
obligation dependent upon a street cadge.
The Red Cross money-box was shaken at Glenelg
on Saturday, when the Mayor and Mrs. Roberts put
their house and grounds at the disposal of the local
committee for the round-up. Another Red Cross rally
tempted the Governor, with Dr. Hayward and Mr.
Winser, to Anlaby-—-the Dutton home near Kapunda—
for a couple of days.
There is only a small exodus of frocks to the Cup
this year. Hubby, of course, will find that the usual
business takes him to Melbourne; but for that and
the newspapers we’d hardly know that the Carnival
was on, being still too depressed at our performance
in the Referendum to take stock of much else.
Miss Pollitt, a daughter of the late Canon Pollitt,
has resigned her position as instructress of the com-
mercial classes at the Mount Gambier School of Mines
dfi go munition-making in England.
Engineer-lieutenant Paterson, of Gawler, who has
been mine-sweeping in the North Sea, has written
home to say that he has been given the job of chief
engineer of a new ship now building on the Clyde.
It is only a little over a year since he joined the ser-
vice, so his promotion has been rapid.
The Chief Inspector of Aborigines reports that 20
of the first South Australian families have volunteered
and been accepted for active service. Eleven ©f them
are from the Point Maeleay abo. station. A good
many others offered but were rejected.
Died on Thursday at Millswood, Edward Laughton,
who joined Elder, Smith and Co. (then Elder, Stirling
and Co.) in 1850. Nine years later he and his
brother-in-law, William Dean, entered into partner-
ship as Dean, Laughton and Co. When that firm was
reorganised the name of Dean dropped from the title.
Edward Laughton was the first man to drive direct
from Adelaide to Menindie, and he opened the route
from Southern Queensland via Cockburn to Adelaide.
His wife died about nine years ago.
We’ve just learned that Lieut. E. W. Gill was
recommended for the Military Croks a few days before
his death. He was also to have had a captaincy and
the command of his battery.
Lieut. H. G. Garland has received the D.C.M.
He saw service at Gallipoli before going to Flanders,
and before Gallipoli he campaigned with the
Register.
Dr. R. W. Stewart has received much sympathy
upon the death of his only son, Captain W. M.
Stewart, an old St. Peter’s boy, who was in the
Rhodesian military police when war broke out. He
enlisted in England, obtained a commission in the
3rd Devons, and three months after he went to the
Front rose to captain's rank. About a year ago he
married an English girl.
Particulars of the “conspicuous gallantry” that won
Lieut. Blackburn his V.C. show that it was something
special, even for this war. Directed, with 50 men,
to drive the enemy from a strong point, he led four
separate parties of bombers and captured 250 yards
of trench. Then, after reconnoitring with a sergeant,
he tore another 150 yards of fortified warren from
the enemy and established communication with a
battalion on his left. Yet he looks, and was, a
rather delicate boy.
Greenland is gnashing its teeth and dis-
appointed India is throwing itself into the
Ganges and urging the crocodile to come on.
It’s all settled now. Melba is off to Hono-
lulu to get rid of the after-effects of in-
fluenza.
Accountant Harry Giddy, an Elsternwick
bachelor, married Miss Milward, of Glenroy,
last week. The bridegroom may get into
khaki before long, it is said. In his salad
days bridegroom Harry and his two younger
brothers were fanatical hockey players, and
until the guns began the trio were Brighton
Yacht Club salts.
George Greene came down from his N. S.
Wales sheep-run last month to be tied up
with cousin Mauren, the late Vesey Brown’s
pi’etty daughter. The ceremony was at St.
John’s, Toorak, and the Best crowded the
house, which their womenfolk had hung with
fresh greenery and roses. No extra fine
feathers—just war-time dressing and a
limited guest-list.
Mrs. Leon Jona, whose Army Medical
captain has spent most of his recent years
on his country’s work, has been keeping the
light burning brightly on the domestic altar
at Malvern ; and the other morning she did
her best to repair the ravages of war with
an acceptable offering of hew twin Jonas.
The Bowes Kelly clan have been hurrying
to and from a private hospital, where
Auntie Isabel Millar had experienced an
operation on her nose. Something had been
wrong with it ever since the lady was hurt
in a taxi accident some years back.
Horror fled whispering through Toorak.
with Dismay a good second, when a military
exemption court decreed that headmaster
Franklin, of Grammar, must go into camp.
The honeyed eloquence of Archdeacon
Hindley on his behalf did not avail. So the
School Council appealed. This time Justice
Hood lent a very kindly ear to their suppli-
cations and granted an exemption. But the
military are determined that this good-look-
ing, lofty Oxonian shall not slip through
their fingers, and an appeal against Justice
Hood’s decision will be heard by the High
Court shortly.
Mrs. Henry Stead, at her Rep. Club
party last Friday, had three singers—
Dorothy Low, Violet Concanen and Sidney
Mannering. Melba is overlooking young
Violet’s Conservatorium studies. She hails
from' the goldfields of Westralia, and when
she showed signs of weariness during a recent
lesson, keen-witted Melba diagnosed the
trouble. < “You’re homesick,'” she said. The
girl admitted the impeachment with a burst
of tears. *;? She sobbed largely into her hand-
kerchief while Melba patted her on the shoul-
der. “I know the feeling,” said Melba. “I’m
going to send you home for a holiday while
I’m away at Honolulu” —and Violet finished
up laughing and sobbing with a firm convic-
tion that Melba is gifted with second sight
as well as an adorable heart.
Kitty Grindlay, who was adored by Mel-
bourne concert-goers some years back, has
been living in Dublin since Australia last
saw her. She returned to Melbourne a
week ago to visit mother at Camberwell. Her
husband is now Lieut.-Commander Wilson,
R.N. He is serving in West Africa and has
been in action lately.
Essie Jenyns Wood’s son Pat, who only
lately left Harrow, is now in the Field
Artillery. His years are IS and his length
Gft. 4in.
Gill a fine art connoisseur, has taken the
rambling old Turn Verein premises on a
long lease. It is to be used for Chamber
music recitals and fine art shows, so air,is
being let in and pictures of the Kaiser let
out. I don’t know what is to be done with
the skittle alley, and I don’t care, but I hope
they leave the shrubberies alone.
Bertram Mackennal shoves his sculping
into the corner pretty frequently nowadays,
and opens the old studio to Australians visit-
ing London in khaki and bandages. It’s
nothing unusual to see several dozen soldiers
swarming over the apartment, surrounded by
food, drink, smoke and an Australian atmo-
sphere, and all talking together about girls,
horses and the 77 wonders of the war.
David Low’s pretty sister Dorothea, who
might have stepped straight out of one of
Dicky Doyle’s drawings, has made her profes-
sional stage debut at one of the Taits’ popu-
lar concerts at the Auditorium. Dorothea
is an exponent of songs at the piano, a la
Margaret Cooper.
Rear-Admiral Oreswell is cheered up by
the news that son Reg has been decorated
with the Servian Order of the White Eagle.
The young captain is in command of a camel
fleet, and flies his pennant on a sulky ship
of the desert —the sentimental epithet the
old school primers used to apply to the
uncanny beast with a bad smell.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

“Bull-Kyan”: “Torkin’ o’ dorgs,” said
Bill as he drained his pot and replaced it on the
hai, there s that yeller cove o’ mine. Earst vear
1 disremembered the date an’ fergot to regester
’im. Next day I was ridin’ in ter do it when I
meets ’im on tlier road with a bit o’ paper an’ a
billy in ’is teeth. W’en ’e sees me ’e puts down ther
billy an’ ’olds up ther paper fer me ter read. Out
fell 6s. 3d. in silver. Somethin’ struck me an’ I feels
in me britches pocket fer ther 10-shillin’ note I ’ad
put there a week afore an’ it was gorn. Knowin’ his
time was up ’e ’ad stole the note an’ kem in ter

ad bort ’isself 6d. of dorg’s meat an’ a billy o’

“Delia” : Last harvest me an’ Blake both
wants a man. Well, we goes to town and there ain’t
no men about, so we thinks the pub is the best
place to wait and see if one turns up. ’Course, you
can’t sit in a bar all day without a drink or two,
and I ends up by gettin’ meself run in for drunk
and disorderly. I has a sleep and when I wakes
up finds another bloke in th’ cell with me. He’d
been drunk and disorderly, too, ar.d strike me if
he ain’t lookin’ for harvest work. ’Course we
settles up about wages and things and I pays both
fines and takes him out home. Blake? No, he
didn’t get inked. He only drinks tea.

Some Cow Country genius should get out
a book of' etiquette and medical hints for the benefit
of cows that were brought up on the bottle and
never bad the benefit of a mother’s advice. A
N. S. Wales cow lately brought a fine bull calf into
the world. Apparently she forgot something, for, nine
days later, she gave her son a sister. The son
brought a milk r icld of half a gallon every bail-
time ; but when the daughter arrived Mum started
to pay a two-gallon dividend.
BORROWING TROUBLE.
MACROSENBAUM, JUN .: “Fader, my
tailor rants a cheque for the ten
pounds I owe him.”
MACROSENVAUM, SEN. : “Don'd
bodder me, Ikey. Vot
d'you rant ter worry
aboud odder beople's
droubles for ?”
“Tiala : There is nothing in “Inver G.’s”
auburn-haired Maori (B. 5/10/’l6) to call for in-
quiry. “Inver” merely met an urukehu. About 350
years ago Henare te Maori annexed the Land o’
Quakes, and, with it, the simple inhabitants who
held the fee simple of the moa run. Those people,
who are a mystery to ethnologists, were murdered
or married at the sweet will of the invader. They
were white of skin and red-haired, and the urukehu
is a throw-back to them. I have Seen dozens of
urukelius, freckles and all.
“A Barrierite for 33 Years”: “Corun-
dum” (B. 5/10/’l6) enters 39 as the largest num-
ber of horses ever seen towing a waggon. In reply,
I wish to accuse myself of having, in the early days
of Broken Hill, removed scores of buildings on a
jinker, amongst them being the Round Hill State
School, which was hauled five miles. We were six
days on the road, and we used to hook up 45 and
in some places 60 to get the required strength. With
myself I had Duncan Mclnnes and Dave Thompson,
with off-siders (old-time Barrier teamsters) to drive.
On different occasions whilst shifting buildings from
Silverton to Broken Hill, a distance of 20 miles, I
have linked up from 38 to 40 head of bullocks, with
foui drivers, photos, of which are in my possession.
These jobs usually kept us a fortnight on the road.

‘Kola”: Head off the wild melon from
your horses. The unblessed vegetable grows in patches,
and in drought time the animals eat it freely. Then
they suffer from night blindness. You may have a
hoise for years without finding this blindness out. I
had one for three years before I dropped to the
trouble, and the discovery threw light on a good
many happenings. The trouble is that the animals
do not recover when they are taken off the diet.
As a rule, they' gradually' get worse and develop
day-blindness. You will come across hundreds of
sufferers in the Riverina. As a rule, a man buying
a horse asks for a night trial there. I saw a horse
once swim to an island, about a mile off shore,
hei e he was left for a* year. He lived on the
melons, and became so blind that when he was
hunted into the water he just swam about until he
was drowned.
* * * •
“Bad Australian”: “Enzedder” (B.
13/1/’l6 which has just reached this pueblo per
mule express) says that he has sampled many differ-
ent types of saddle in South America —Peruvian,
Chilian, Bolivian, Argentine, Paraguayan, Uruguayan
and Brazilian—and no two are the same. The only
one I can identify by “Enzedder’s” description is
that used by the flash carrero in some of the
southern ports. The carrero looks like a super-
annuated pirate doing postilion on the near side
mule of his team while he belts the other with a
bit of trace-chain lashed to a stockwhip handle. Even
this horse-marine always has his saddle rigged with
a fairly thick, tanned, leather covering, usually
carpincho hide, so that he doesn’t roost hard down
on the raw, hot wool. If “Enzedder’s” saddle had been
rigged like that he wouldn’t have suffered so much
discomfort as to cause him to shed the pelt and ride
on the bare framework. Now, the saddle I was
endeavoring to bring under the notice of Billjim is
the saddle used by the gaucho of the pampa or flat
country, not the flash city carrero or the mountain
arriero, who piles himself on his diminutive animal
like so much baggage. The padding of the gaucho’s
saddle consists of just enough roughly-tanned skins
to form a damp-proof bunk under him o’ nights, and
the balance of comfort comes from a couple of
ponchos and the carpincho hide cover. A poncho
is a more or less ornate blanket with a hole in the
centre through which the owner thrusts his head
when he feels the want of an overcoat. The gaucho
is a stockman and hunter who uses a mule only when
he can’t steal a horse, and it was 911 account of the
undoubted comfort and comprehensiveness of his
saddle as a soul-satisfying bushman’s home that I
whooped it up in preference to any saddle ‘l' have
struck elsewhere, and I have spent a large part of
my life mounted. •
“Gharn” : “Corundum’s” 89-horse team (B.
5/10/T6) will take beating,' but this may be worth
a place bet. About 20 years back the combined
teams of Messrs. Doyle, Warren and McCarron, num-
bering 36, went ahead of a boiler consigned to the
Dargo mine, Major’s Creek (N.S.W.). The journey
started at Tarago and covered a distance of 44 miles.
About 12 years ago 40 horses were yoked to a boiler
belonging to the Adelong Gold Estates, but the
tackling couldn’t hold them, although several efforts
were made.
THE POLICEMAN’S GOOD JOKE.
INEBRIATED SUBURBANITE: “Wish one ev those (hie) cottages doesh Misher Brown
live in?”
THE COP: “The middle one, sir.”
I.S.: “Thash a goo’ joke (hie), Pleeshman —middle one —and theresh only two of ’em!”
“Sydney F. Smith”: Australia is not
likely to foster a curse in the algaroba tree. There
is nothing the matter with it, and it is all “J.G.”
mentioned to The Bulletin. It is a native of
.arid Arizona, and should do well in the dry districts
of the Commonwealth. It flourishes in the dry parts
qf the Hawaiian Islands where other trees will not
grow, and between Honolulu and Pearl Harbor some
beautiful groves of it can be seen. It ascends to
about 25 feht, has a pleasant bushy top, and a hard
' trunk about'nine inches-in diameter. I should say,
from its leaf, that it belongs to the acacia family.
The fruit is like a locust bean, and is sweet, and
rich in sugar and protein. Cattle and pigs are very
fond .of -it. Some 20 years ago. when I was magis-
trate of Kadavu, in the Fiji Islands, I obtained a
bag of seed from Honolulu, and endeavored to
establish it, but, I believe, without success. Had I
been in one of the dry districts then, as I afterwards
was, I think I should have succeeded.

“Try Fluke”: Maoriland farmers are-up
pretty solidly against Minister Russell’s proposal to
import opossums by the shipload from over the Tas-
man Sea and liberate them in the North Island bush.
Russell seems to see in brer ’possum a heaven-sent
means of getting quit of the national debt and of
endowing M.L. with a great national asset. A ’pos-
sum skin, says he, is worth so much —let’s say half
a crown ; well then, how much would 500,000,000,000
skins be worth? It’s a simple sum that the Hon.
Russell can do with both legs tied; but the hon.
farmer and hon. orehardist see another side to it.
The ’possum is already a nuisance wherever he has
spread in M.L. He raids the fruit-trees wholesale,
and spoils more than he eats, and he is worse than
a rat when he decides to take possession of a dwell-
ing or an outhouse. The bush has no attractions
for him; no very good kaikai there. Hon. ’Possum
may be all right in his native habitat, but in M.L.—
no, thank you.

“Pick”: “Yarrum” (B. 5/10/’l6) wants
to know if the bursting of his gun, when choked at
the muzzle with dirt, was a singular accident. It
wasn’t. When the force of an explosion takes place
within any iron or steel cylinder, a rapid wave-like
expansion of the tube walls travels from the closed
end (in firearms called the breech) to the exit or
muzzle. But when this end is also closed up the compres-
sion of air driven forward by the explosion prevents
the regular, expansion along- the barrel and the expan-
sive force is all directed laterally, with the result
that the steel is burst asunder. Incidentally, it’s a
pity more guns are not choked at the muzzle
when “sports” are out ruthlessly destroying the few
remaining feathered Australians.
“Verdad”: Queer coffins? The queerest
and most appropriate one I ever saw or heard of
was made to hold the remains of a miner who died
in Bolivia, where timber is very scarce and they
don’t understand English. It is the local custom for
the mining co. to supply the timber for coffins, so
when the sick man passed I gave an order on the
store for some empty boxes. Our carpenter made
such a good job of it that he proudly called me to
CRUELTY TO KETTLES.
MRS. MIGGS: “I’ll learn yer to tie a kettle
to a cat’s tail!”
THE KID: “It wasn’t our cat!”
MRS. MIGGS: “No; but it was our kettle!”
look at his handiwork. The coffin, which had not
been P) aned or painted, was covered all over with
suitable warnings and appeals—“ Keep Cool,” “Stow
away from Boilers,” “Use no hooks,” “Highly
explosive.” The late lamented was going into the
Woldd in old dynamite boxes,

MAGIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
So do I marvel at Spring—the flush of her cheek on
the fruit:
When every road is a string, which tugs at each gipsv
boot; 1 J
The fluting of birds in the eaves, bright breezes that
blow from the sea;
1 ,le glory-song of the leaves, when the sap floods up
through the tree ;
The kiss of her lips on my brow—O brow that is
blessed by her lips!—
The tone of the waves at the prow, and the bay with
its fluttering ships !
But more than all magic of sea and marvels of
mellowing lands
Is the Spring that is wakened in me by the touch of
your lily-white hands.
MAORI LAND.

HOW TO REMOVE FAT.
EXPLAINED BY FAMOUS FRENCH
HERB SPECIALIST.
“To preserve a youthful appearance and
activity a lady ought to look in the mirror
and take careful account of her figure every
now and then,” said Mine. Damere in a
recent beauty culture lecture. “If she sees
a double chin forming, if cheeks, neck or
arms are getting too plump, or should hips
and abdomen bulge more than they used to,
it is time she did something beside just
worrying. A simple herb recipe which I
have never known to fail in taking off extra
rolls of fat is easily made up at home by
getting from the chemist one dram of quassia
chips and three ounces, of cirola-bark extract.
Put the quassia chips in a pan and pour over
them a teacupful of boiling water. In about
half a minute strain through a cloth and add
the cirola-bark extract. Apply every day to
double chin, fleshy hips, abdomen, or any-
where you want to be thinner, rubbing in
gently with a circular movement, but be
careful to apply only where you want fat
removed, and I am sure you will be delighted
with the change that takes place within a
week or ten days.”— Advt,
“A contented mind is a continual feast”—you get
both when you drink Kartell's Brandy. There are
no better judges than Britons, and they decide in
favor of Martell’s every time. From George I. to
George V. Kartell's has been supreme —not only the
favorite in England but in France as well. It is
superior for social purposes, and being rich in the
higher ethers is also unequalled in cases of sick-
ness.

Actress Tells Secret
A Well-known Actress Tells How She
Harkened Her Grey Hair with a
Simple Home-made Mixture.
Miss Blanche Rose, a well-known actress,
who darkened her grey hair with a simple
preparation which she mixed at home, in a
recent interview made the following state-
ment : “Any lady or gentleman can darken
their grey hair and make it soft and glossy
with this simple recipe, which they can mix
at home. To a half-pint of water add loz.
of bav rum and a small box ot Orlex Com-
pound. These ingredients can be bought at
any chemist’s at very little cost. Apply to
the hair twice a week until it becomes the
required shade. This will make a » ie .y _
haired person look 20 years younger.. It is
also fine to promote the growth of ha.r, and
relieves itching and dandruff. —Advt. LI

520 GEORGES’" SYDNEY
iC /10MTER 3' NEWCASTLE
“St. Jimmy”: The great Australian
blanky got a hearing in Morwell (Vic.) Advertiser
a few days ago:—
APOLOGY.
I hereby wish to apologise to Mrs. and the Misses
Moyseys for making a statement in public accusing
them of being b y liars, which I afterwards
found was not correct.
JAMES DENHAM.
But James doesn’t make clear exactly what he
docs retract, which recalls the old yarn in The
Bulletin. Bill complains that some bloque in the
bar has called him a blanky liar twice, and he
(Bill) won’t stand it. “All right, all right,” says
his pacifying cobber, “he’s withdrawn the blanky.”
* * * *
“Quidam”: Re sizeable shouts. When
one recruit in Sydney was asked whether he had
any income to come back to, he replied that he
couldn’t swear to a pound or so, but it was about
£15,000 a year. Investigation proved that it was
quite true, and the very rich person was passed as
worthy to fight for his little stake in the country.
His lot regarded him as a doubtful curio ; but when
a large batch was near a pub after a hot march,
and one jokingly dared him to shout for the mob,
he did it with such indifference that no one has
questioned his bona fides since. It was the largest
shout any of those warriors had ever known,
* * * *
“Martin Rattler”: This isn’t the worst
case of the kind that I know of, but the picnickers
reckon it will do as far as they are concerned. Five
of them, natives of Foutona, near Fiji, were blown
out to sea in a whaleboat during a gale. For three
weeks they were without food, helpless victims of the
wind and waters, and it is hardly credible that any
of them were alive when on the 21st day the boat
was washed up on one of the Reef Group. Yet only
one man had died of starvation, and two of the sur-
vivors were women. By chart the drift was about
960 miles.
* * * *
“Pick” : Mount Dromedary, a two-liumped
isolated pimple that rises 2000 ft. from the shoreland
of the N.S.W. South Coast, with wild jungles, moss-
grown rocky rivulets, and incredibly varied forest
growths, ranks among the also-rans as an Australian
beauty patch ; but for variety of ferns it simply
romps in a winner. Von Mueller, the Victorian
botanist, employed an expert to track out the medi-
cinal flora of the Southern seaboard. Incidentally
he classified upwards of 250 species of true fern on
the mountain slopes, and those did not include the
hair-like plants known to Dromedary rangers as fern
grasses, which are said to grow nowhere else on the
planet.
AN IMPENDING
DISSOLUTION.
CONSTABLE: “I see
you’ve been knock-
ing Mary about
again, Jacky. What
do you mean by it?”
JACK: “ Mine tinkit
very quick soon I
gettim divorce or
plurry well gibbit
’er in charge.”
“Barcoo” : Along the edge of the so-called
“desert” of Central Queensland the wild hop-bush
luxuriates. It grows eight or nine feet high, and
the leaves are very thick. Lake Dunn cattle-station
has used this vegetable for years, and the cook’s yeast
bread has a reputation for hundreds of miles. The
local inhabitant brews hop-beer, also, and very
palatable swank it is, too.
“Trafalgar”: Anyone tell me the weight
of the heaviest fresh-water eel caught in Australia ?
On the Moe Swamp (Vic.) some lagoons were
drained and the beds swarmed with the fish. The
heaviest caught weighed 371 b., and was sft. 6in.
long. Specimens between 101 b. and 201 b. were com-
mon. The flavor, if the flesh were cooked fresh,
was muddy, but, if it were cured like bacon, it was
passable.
* * * *
“C.G.” : I’ll go back to ’79 (I think) for
the biggest team. It hauled a 40-ton boat built by
R. White in Young-street, Fitzroy (Melb.), to the
Yarra. Forty-nine horses commenced the tow one
Friday night and finished it on Saturday morning.
“Tiaki” : A Maori divorce case is gener-
ally mighty interesting. In one in which I acted
as interpreter the lady was a handsome half-caste
and the plaintiff a rich squatter. Meri brought
fearful counter-charges against her white lord and
her own sister, but when it was shown that she had
no ghostly hope of succeeding she accepted £5OO
and threw in the towel. After the whakawa I pro-
ceeded to the hotel to see how she was bearing up
against her fate. I found her seated at the piano
in a room filled with pimps, lawyers, interpreters,
witnesses and all kinds of hangers-on. The cham-
pagne was hissing in the glasses and the dead
marines were as numerous as torpedoed steamers.
Meri had a cigarette fixed at the corner of her lips
and was leading in the chorus of “I wonder who's
kissing her now.” Little picnics like this help to
lighten life’s load a lot.
* * * »
“Ahediba Tauna” : Bullswool dwelt in the
Eastern Division of Papua and was related by
“marriage” in many villages. When a British co.
arrived, and had recruiters busy, Bullswool arranged
with the co. to induce natives to sign on for
three years instead of the’ usual 12 moons, he to
receive £9 per head instead of the ordinary £3.
.On this bargain he persuaded his native relations
and their friends to the number of 185 to work
along friend belong him for three moons. When
this period had expired they downed tools and
demanded to be returned home. “What for alto-
gether boy you want finish work along three
feller moon?” inquired their plantation bosses.
“You altogether bin sign on along magistrate along
three feller year, not three feller moon.” Then
the smell broke loose and 120 very savage niggers
were released by the authorities and raged home
for somebody’s gore. But Bullswool and his magis-
trate pal had left that district; and they haven’t
returned since. That was the only noteworthy
instance of blaekbirding in Papua.
“Truthful James”: There are two “hat-
ters” who have resided on the east coast of Papua
for the last 20 years. They exist by getting alluvial
gold in the adjacent flats. Both have adopted the
standard of living set up by the natives, excepting
in regard to lack of clothes. The male native’s
outfit in this region consists of a shell. One of
the hatters goes to the extent of wearing a shirt;
the other defies the Fresh Air League in portion of
a pair of trousers. Both men are firmly convinced
that Henry Parkes will eventually float their show.
TO AVOID A SECOND HANDLING.
THE ECONOMIST: “I say, Miss, we’d save a lot of time if you and me changed places."
“Bushman” : “Tiaki” (B. 28/9/’l6) wants
to know if forests suffer from epidemics. They do.
About the middle of last century myriads of small
beetles suddenly appeared in North Gippsland and
quickly killed about 100 square miles of red-gum
forest by devouring the leaves. Some of our smooth-
barked eucalypts are very sensitive to the loss of
their leaves. When Black Brother died out the
native bear, or koala, increased enormously, and as
his diet was exclusively eucalyptus leaves miles of
forests were killed.
* * * »
“Mitchell Grass”: Learning that Potts
Point and St. Kilda are economising during the war
I hasten to pass along the recipe for preparing an
ash and fat floor. Boil fat; sift gidya ashes; mix
while fat is at boiling point and lay down at once.
Only a small quantity should be mixed at a time
as it sets very quickly. The proportions are easily
found by experiment, and if you keep the floor away
from sun and rain it will last as long as the reputa-
tion of the Strolling Ilogans.
* * * *
“E. Jerard” : We were out of vegetables,
with no chance of getting any under a three weeks’
beat against the trades, for the dusky island poten-
tate had issued an edict that we were not to be
traded with. The amorous cause of our woes, the
supercargo, was d —d foi*e and aft, and that gave
me an idea. When troubled the “super ” habitually
took out his false teeth, presumably to allow the
profanity freer egress. “Why, man, that is just the
thing,” I said ; “you come ashore with me.” “And
get a spear through the neck,” he snarled.
“Rot,” I answered ; “put your teeth back and come
along. These niggers don’t know what false teeth
are. I’ll tell them you can work great pourri-pourri
(sorcery), even to taking your teeth out and putting
them back again, and that if they don’t let us have
exactly what we want, you will make all their teeth
drop out quick time. Then you must smile, show-
ing all your beautiful tusks, and I’ll tap you on the
head. You turn away, take out your molars. I tap
you, and behold! your mouth is again full of ivory.”
When I told the chief that our super could lift out
all his teeth and put them back again he laughed in
a poisonous manner, but when he saw it done he
was ready to grovel in the sand. For three solid
hours did that super perform. to the assembled
crowds, until at last, out of sheer humanity, I
stopped the show. Then I broached the subject of
vegetables, hinting that if there were not plenty
forthcoming, the sorcerer would work the spell on
them. Next morning we loaded up with 15 tons
of yams, taro, sweet potatoes and pumpkins, not to
mention 10 large bags of sappi sappi shell, and all
along the sand beach we could see the blighters tap-
ping each other’s heads and examining their mouths
to see if their fangs had gone.
“Simon”: Re “Yarrum” and his bandi-
coot feast,. It reminds me of the time I worked for
a skinflint cocky in the Rylstone (N.S.W.) district.
One day I came in with an appetite like Esau s, but
gradually wore it down with two large plates of
something much above the average fare offering in
that quarter. Dinner over, the small boy of the
house followed me out to the woodheap and asked
if I knew what I’d been shifting. I didn’t. “The
kangaroo-rat w’at Toby caught,” he said. I didn’t
fret or pine, but merely thought there are more
things meat on earth than it is meet to fall out
with when one is hungry.
“Barcoo”: Paragraphs about overlanding
recall those kings of the road of 30 years ago or
less —the two Gilberts, Tom and Harry ; Dad Bennett
and “The Parson,” his brother; Hood, Tom Larkin,
Ted Barrow, Bill Henery, Jack Nichol, the two
Gwvnnes, “Old Tom” Underwood, “Dad” Patton, the
three Fletchers, Jackson, McCabe, Jim Murdoch,
Boyle, Jimmy and Johnny Cragie, Harry Redford
(hero of “Robbery Under Arms”), the three Wil-
liams bros., Jack and Dick Skuthorp, “Deaf Wattie”
Rose, Gordon, Lotigmore, “Bull” Hopkins, Frazer
(survivor of the Hornet Bank murders by the
blacks), “The Wild Scotchman,” “Flash” Banks,
Scholfield (“The Bush Rat”), and Burgess (“Sundown
Billy”). Some are now owners of stations, others
are managers of large places or keeping roadside pubs,
but the great majority are helping Peter to draft the
sheep from the goats.
LAMENT FOR PERISHED OYSTERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The frosts which prevailed, during the winter
caused heavy mortality amongst oysters in George's
River. —Pathetic news item.
Alas for the Oyster, that reticent thing
That sits in the water whilst waiting for Spring!
The frosts of late winter have ended his life
And blunted the edge of the Greek’s ready knife.
Alas for the chorus girl, ready to sup!
The Oyster is dead, and the languishing pup
Who used to escort her has gone into camp;
Now she eats fish and chips by a kerosene lamp.
And what were the Oyster’s last words as he died?
Inquire of the fish or the fast-ebbing tide!
Like a family lawyer for prudence was he,
And all his opinions are buried at sea.

HEARNE’S
BRONCHITIS
= CURE =
IS THE FINEST REMEDY IN THE WORLD FOR
COUGHS, GROUP AND COLDS.
THOSE who have had occasion to take Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure are
astonished at its Wonderful Healing Power. Sufferers from Bron-
chitis, Cough, Croup, Pain or Soreness in the
Chest, Hoarseness, Difficulty of Breathing, Stuffiness,
Asthma, experience delightful and rapid relief. This
medicine is particularly valuable to those who are sub-
ject to Colds on the Chest, as it Strengthens the Lungs,
and renders them less susceptible. It is most comfort-
ing in allaying Irritation in the Throat, and giving
Strength to the Voice, and for this reason is thoroughly
appreciated by Clergymen, Public Speakers and
Singers. It does not allow a Cough to become
Chronic, and in this respect is absolutely indis-
pensable in preventing a cold from developing
into Bronchitis, Asthma, Pneumonia, Pleurisy,
or Consumption. No house should be with-
out a bottle of this Wonderful Remedy, as
taken at the first indication of a Cold, a
dose or two is generally sufficient. A
Cold should always be “nipped in the
bud,” or serious illness may follow.

The Inky Way.
“Billy” Briggs, who died a few days ago,
was the last survivor on the S. M. Herald
staff of the fine team the old paper sent to
do the Federal Convention when it opened
at Adelaide. There were Henry Gullett,
leader-writer ; Donald Murray, chief-of-staff ;
Pratt and Briggs. Subsequently Briggs took
over the Herald’s mining column or two,
chiefly because he came from Bendigo, where
everybody picks up a bit of mining patter.
He made his start on the goldfield in the
Independent office, which has suckled a
large family of good men. “Billy” was a
genial soul, far too unsophisticated to be
thrown into a den of market-riggers; but at
least nobody can say that he didn’t go
straight. He was 62 when his lease ran out.

“Bad Australian” from Buenos Aires: —
The cosmopolitanism of Buenos Aires is well exem-
plified by its press. The dailies number almost 50,
embracing all shades of thought and language—Eng-
lish, French, Italian, Swiss, Spanish, Turkish (mostly
Syrian), Israelitish and German. The leading papers
are La Prenza and La Nacion (Argentine), the
Herald and Standard (British). The Italians are
represented by the Patria degli Italiani, while the
Square-heads unload their hot-air and constitutional
inaccuracy on the suffering puibjic through the
Deutsche la Plata Zeitung and the Argentinischer
Tagleblatt, and two skulking rags in which they do
their war propaganda in Spanish, La Union and the
Gaceta de Espana. As well as the dailies we have
the choice of about 200 weekly, monthly and occa-
sional publications dealing out anything from the
ultra-philosophical to the putridly indecent. One of
the cleverest of the weeklies is published by Emir
Arslan, formerly Turkish Consul here, who shortly
after the unholy alliance between Bill Ilohenzollern
and the Unspeakable was fired out of his job for re-
fusing to hand over the consulate and’its contents to
the bumptious German agent, Emir. Arslan unloaded a
scrap that made the Hun sit up. Then he shook the
dust of the consulate off his Oriental slippers, packed
up his spare turban and hubble-bubble and started out
on the Inky Way to whoop up the Allied cause. In
this he is aided by some of the cleverest and most
trenchant writers in the country. The way his paper
La Nota twists the tail of the Dachshund causes more
than one worshipper of that elongated pup to shed
tears into his lager.

“Pen” : Left to themselves pressmen would
have as little chance of drinking themselves
out of debt in a club as they would of
amassing wealth in any other way, for nowa-
days they are a notoriously sober crowd.
The Perth Press Club, which was given a nat
on the back by The Bulletin a couple of
weeks ago, is a press club only in name, and
that may explain its prosperity since it got a
bar license. The newspaper men who started
it shared the same fate as those who started
the Athenaeum in Sydney and the Johnson-
ian in Brisbane years ago. There were not
enough pressmen to make a do of it; so they
invited outsiders to come in and help, but
omitted a clause in the constitution to keep
the control solely in their own hands. Then
the icicle that they had warmed in their
bosoms melted and flooded them out. Syd-
ney Press Club is determined not to make the
same mistake. Outsiders are admitted, but
only A. J.A. . men have any voice in the
management. Perth nressmen are now think-
ing of forming another club, and this time
they’ll know better.
“M.H.8.”: The death of George Bull
caused great regret amongst Inky Way-
farers here in the Biv Smoke. He was cheer-
ful up to the operation, which revealed
cancer of the stomach. On the previous day
he gave me his last contribution to the page
he had written for 12 years in London
Opinion (“The Playful Stallite”). Besides
that he did a great deal of work for Alfred
Butt and Robert Courtneidge, and had for
years written the dramatic gossip in the
Tribune.

“ J.F.H.” : The press gallery of the House
of Commons has been expressing its plea-
sure and satisfaction at the appointment of
IT. E. Duke, K.C., as Chief Secretary for
Ireland. He is the first old Gallery hand to
attain Cabinet rank. Duke, in acknowledg-
ing the resolution, recalled “the pleasant and
toilsome days and nights” he spent in the
Gallery in the early ’Bo’s. Other ex-Gallery
men who went down to the floor of the
House as M’s.P. include Chief Justice Lord
Russell of Killowen, Sir Edward Clarke,
Justin McCarthy, T. P. O’Connor, Sir
Henry Dalziel, and the Australian J. F.
Hogan, who started off in London as Parlia-
mentary sketch writer for the Globe.
* * * *
“Seelee”: A poor cocky had neglected to
destroy rabbits, and I know a member of a
Pastures Protection Board who pleaded hard
for him on the ground of “exterminating cir-
cumstances.”
“Copabella”: Councillor Malaprop ex-
celled himself this week. He was a delegate
to a consumption conference, and came back
full of information. “The great thing,” he
said, “is to treat the complaint in its insipid
stages.” He also said that in one branch
of their investigation the results had been
nil. “But — nil referendum /” he remarked
optimistically.
“Murkah”: The Navy department, which
now controls Australia’s wireless telegraph
stations, has introduced a press service to
ships in Australian waters. Previously ves-
sels, though fitted with the spark, steamed
round our coasts in savage ignorance of the
progress of events. Now abbreviated infor-
mation on matters of national interest, such
as “Gray, in play, 9831,” latest scratehings
and so on, is “broadcasted” from enough of
the coast stations to reach ships all round
the continent. Four stations easily manage
to feed the scurrying sea-things with the
stuff they love bbst.
* * * *
“Incas”: There’s another splendid billet
open to an experienced journalist who has
also done a little debt-collecting. The Vic-
torian Forest League has determined to start
an Educational journal; and for a really
competent editor who understands forestry as
well as how to collect the annual subscrip-
tions of half a crown from members of the
Forest League the committee offers one pound
a week ! He needn’t give all his time to it,
of course. He might dignify the profession
by running a peanut can in his spare
moments.
* * * »
“Lux”: The lino, had just reached us and
the foreman was so elated with being able
to lift a “stick” a time with finger and thumb
that he became careless and was prone to
drop a few slugs. It happened with the
report of a funeral, and the absence of the
dropped “slug” made the account read:
“The deceased, who was well known and
respected in the district, walked in front of
the hearse.”
The twin sisters Literature and Journal-
ism live on defiantly in the French trenches.
Every mile or so there is a ditch newspaper
with a cheery name and (occasionally) illus-
trations as well. Some titles : Anti-Groucii,
War-Cry, Echoes of Trenciiville, Fusil-
lade, Indiscreet Poilu, Periscope, Terri-
ble Poilu-torial, Flea, Glow-worm, Merry
Laugh, Oh, Fine ! and Voice of
the .75. And there are one or two with a
hint in the title of other uses the paper may
be put to if it’s no good to read. Generally
they strive for cheerfulness, but Literature
creeps in now and then with some first-hand
horror. Thus, lately there was an English
translation of a wonderfully powerful poem,
“The Dead Man,” from Le Poilu, remorse-
lessly describing the burial of a staring, dead
soldier in a flooded common grave.

On the death of “Carados” (George
Spencer Edwards—“handsome George” of
old Fleet street days) G. R. Sims revives the
story of the origin of the London Referee.
It was founded close on 40 years ago, and
Sims has kept up his “Mustard and Cress”
the whole time. The only other survivors of
the first staff are Butler, now the editor, and
Chance Newton, who does half the “Carados”
column. G.R.S. says that he used to be sus-
pected of much of the dramatic criticism;
but since he made a success as dramatist
(which was in 1879) he has done none. “I
did not consider that it was cricket for a
playwright to sit in judgment on the wares
of his trade competitors.”

Jack Flanagan, the young Bulletin car-
toonist who found one of his own drawings
looking him in the eye as he stepped off the
boat on to America some months ago, has
improved on that prompt introduction. His
work is now seen in Puck, he is on the list
of contributors to Pearson’s, and he re-
cently had a full-page in one of N’York’s
threewolu me newspapers.
Another Australian penwoman has got
her goods on the book-market. Ward, Lock
and Co. are publishing “Max the Sport: a
Public-school Story for Boys.” The author-
ess, Lilian Pyke, was Lillie Heath, of Mel-
bourne, in her spinster days. After a few
years of married life in Queensland she is
back in Melbourne, a widow, with three
bairns; and “Max the Sport” is her first ven-
ture outside the field of journalism.
“Bob D.”: Cursed be the man who
betrays a great paper into giving a free ad.!
One of the local picture concerns lately
mailed out a number of “teaser” advertising
postcards, preparing the way for a film it
intended showing. The receipt of one stam-
peded a simple Melbournite, who charged
down to the Age office with the supposed
threat. Next morning’s paper emerged with
the following par.:—
Anti-conscriptionists are indulging in strange
methods of putting their views forward. On Monday
a resident of Melbourne brought under the notice
of this office a crude picture postcard delivered with
the morning’s mail. The card contains the following
printed inscription: “Beware of the Green Fist. Heed
this warning. Protect yourself against the evil eye
by wearing the sign of the horned thumbs.” Ihe
postman was delivering many other similar cards.
Further, illustrations of even more unscrupulous
methods are at the present time in the hands of the
Government, and it is expected that within the next
few days interesting revelations will be made.
The Age was right about the revelations -
it published them at the usual rates in the
proper advertising columns.
* * * *
The Censor has made us all careful. The
body of a woman was fished out of a N.S.W.
river the other day. A 501 b. mass of machin-
ery was attached to the feet, which were
pinioned tightly, like the arms. “Suspicious
Death!” whispered the Evening Ghoul.
“Kuku-Kuku” : The natives of Papua may
or may not be familiar with Darwin’s
“Descent of Man” in the original, but they
have certainly got hold of some of its con-
clusions. There was a monkey in the East-
ern Division some few years ago, a pet of a
local merchant. It became exceedingly cele-
brated among the natives of the surrounding
districts, who ran excursions and personally-
conducted tours to look at it. They treated
it with grave politeness, as a rule, and
always brought something for it to eat. They
used to discuss its peculiarities with puzzled
interest, but did not arrive at any definite
conclusion until an old woman from a far
inland tribe set them on the right track.
“It is not a pig, it is not a dog,” some of the
Papuan visitors were arguing one day, before
the verandah whereon pranced and chattered
the monkey. “What, then, can it be?” And
the old woman (in Papua they say that the
deepest wisdom is to be found among the
old women of the tribe) looked at the beast
gravely, then turned to her aged husband
and said as gravely, “It is your grand-
father.” And the people agreed. When the
monkey died, of the usual consumption, “a
deep gloom was cast over the locality,” even
as (one hears) it is cast over the bush
township when the uncle of the local publi-
can’s grandfather has died after a year or
two’s illness. The mission natives begged
the body from the owners, and took it away.
And the owners, being busy, forgot about it
-—until one day, some weeks later, when they
came upon a little grave in the bush. It
was a grave nicely kept, decorated with
flowers, and it had a cross at the head, and
the grandfather of the Oldest Inhabitant
was tucked away underneath.
“A6s3’s” tale of the floods: —
My beat was up to my third rib, so to speak, when
I saw Gaylard coming home. Where he’s been, the
Lor-rd knows, but if he’d stayed for one more he’d
never have come home at all. He’s to his middle
in river water, and his belltopper’s to the back of
his head, and his umbrella is up, and he’s singin’
like the lark. He found his own house with some
difficulty, waded in through a good foot of water,
and in one minute later was out again with a des-
perate air, and catches my eye. “Oh, there y’ar,
constable,” sez he, and he slips me half a crown.
“Fer the love iv Heaven,” he sez, “get me a
plumber, quick. There’s a leak somewhere.”
“Edo”: The Westralian section of the
trans-Australian railway is now constructed
for over 500 miles and is about 00 miles
across the South Aus. border. This puts the
progress made on the eastern section right in
the shade —a healthy condition of affairs
entirely due to Superintending-Engineer
Darbyshire, who manages to avoid labor
troubles. The only delay Darbyshire has
experienced was when he himself went on
strike sooner than allow King O’Malley to
force on him that extraordinary character
Gilchrist.
“Try Fluke” : The yellow-blossomed kowhai
as a floral emblem is not the best that Maori-
land could choose. The tree is inconspicuous
and not particularly picturesque. But what
is the matter with the ti-palm, otherwise the
cabbage-tree? It is the most plentiful tree
on the M.L. landscape, growing where no
other can flourish. On the gale-swept Ivain-
garoa Plains, where scarcely even the fern
can make a living, it hoists its lordly head
of sword-leaves 30 and 40 feet above the
pumice soil. It is far more hardy than the
ferntree or the nikau and more striking. I
saw one enormous fellow in the Waiteti
Valley, near Rotorua, that was reputedly
500 years old. A pious cannibal, by the
name of Ihenga, planted it as a. sort of
prayer-tree in a tapu ground, and it is still
going strong.
“Copabella”: A northerly buster lately
shook up one of the few historical land-
marks we have in Victoria. On a bluff
overlooking the Maribyrnong River, near
Footscray, is an ancient structure known
variously as the Old Church, the Haunted
Castle and the Malakoff Tower, built of
rough local basalt and slatestone, and
crowned with a square stub-spired tower.
As it was erected in the days when the
Fishers owned the old Maribyrnong run
and the blacks roamed the river valley,
some said it was intended as a fortress.
Other stories say that as it commanded a
view of the whole of the Keilor, Maidstone
and Braybrook plains and the rolling pad-
docks of Footscray and Essendon, its func-
tion was that of a lookout over the wander-
ing shepherds, and that its tower served as
a signal station. Probably the most authen-
tic story is this. During a drought, when
sheep began to die or to be of so little mar-
ket value as not to be worth killing for
meat, a man built the old boiling-down
works at Maribyrnong. One of his troubles
was caused by his employees going to Essen-
don on Sundays and not returning thence
until well into the next week. When the
boss remonstrated a humorist replied that
the men had to go to the village to church,
and were there tempted to stray. So the
tallow-boiler decided to build a church. Com-
bining business with soul-saving, as a vane
on top of the spire he placed a gilded sheep.
This was a guiding mark to the shepherds
overlanding their flocks to the “boiling-
down.” The building was disused and ageing
in the ’so’s, and then received the Crimean
name of Malakoff. Some time ago an
attempt was made to interest the Historical
Society in the old landmark, and one of the
Melbourne dailies flew a kite on its behalf.
But there was no money nor advertisement
in history, and nothing was done.
DESK-WORK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here with my face to the senseless wood, hemmed in
by gaoler walls,
I long to be out upon the hills where every free
wind calls;
There are hills and seas and mountains yet and I
would seek them soon,
For purple shadows are racing past to some lone
sea-wind’s croon.
The clouds come in With the rising gale and all the
trees bend low ;
The air is clear as a child’s blue eye, yet what if it
bids me go?
Here I must stay with my face to the wood while
Joy is riding high,
Because there is shelter, food and clothes and other
blamed rot to buy.

THE SUB.
HE LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now Slyppe was a bright reporter-youth,
Aud he wrote and drank with ease;
He’d naught but scorn for the plain, dull truth,
And his “stuff” was carved like cheese.
His lives were always “pronounced extinct,”
And he loved a “fruitless quest” ;
He wrote them down with a pen well-inked
And a young reporter’s zest.
But one bright phrase on his young nib hung,
And to use it oft he yearned;
It lives in print but it knows no tongue—
He “left no stone unturned.”
He dragged the rock into ev’ry par.,
And he turned it o’er and o’er ;
His editor gave him many a jar,
But he only turned the more.
His eyes were fixed on the shining Chair,
And the starlike screw that burned ;
So he chewed his pen, and he inked his hair,
And he left no stone unturned.
The editor liked the eager lad,
But he once was heard to groan:
“That d —d young fool will drive me mad
With his everlasting stone!”
Slyppe reached the end of his rope one day,
And his young hopes came to wreck;
They sank him deep off the Inky Way
With his stone about his neck.

The New South Wales Department
of Navigation notifies launch owners,
builders and motor manufacturers that,
after the Ist January, 1917, any motor-
launch, new or old, coming under survey
for a passenger certificate for the first
time, should be fitted with motors using
paraffin, or other fuel having a flash-
point of not less than 73 degrees
Fahr., Abel’s close test. Although it is
desirable not to carry any petrol on board
these launches, a small quantity may, if
necessary, be allowed for starting pur-
poses, provided it is limited to the
smallest quantity practicable for the
motor. No petrol should be carried in a
closed motor room, or in any closed space
used by the passengers or crew. The
petrol tank must either be placed on
deck and provided with a suitable wooden
covering, or placed in an isolated and
well-ventilated compartment.

Vull Instructions for Planting and Harvesting
Sudan Grass has proved the salvation ofl
Ithe American fanner. For years past there<
'has been a serious shortage in the hay crop Jn<
'America, and stock raisers were dismayed arid|
becoming hopeless until Sudan Grass was,
introduced by the Government, who had
tained.it from Northern Africa and subjected
it to the most rigorous tests. The report of
the United States Department of Agriculture
iWas’tiiaC T> Sudan Grass is a great success in the dryer
regions and under irrigatiou has surpassed alfalfa. In
“the more humid States Sudan Grass also succeeds well,
ix hut not so well as in the semi-arid States, where it secures,
“the droughty conditions it delights in.” Sudan Grass (
has proved the most profitable forage crop in America.
Farmers are making up to £2O per acre for hay and £60 1
( to £BO per acre for seed. It yields the highest tonnage
any hay crop. It is sweet and juicy and the best possible!
fodder for stock. It is an excellent rotating crop, as it!
conserves and increases the fertility of the soil. Being a
light rooter, it cannot overrun or become a pest, though it
grows most prolificacy, over a hundred stalks springing
from some of the stools. Last seasou in America the demand
for seed was so great that the price went up to 12/6 per
pound, but we have secured a good supply of splendid
clean seed that we can confidently recommend to farmers
here Send 3/- for a trial package, or ask for Circular
giviug full particulars about Sudan Grass; we will post it
without charge. From now till December is the time for
planting. This quality of seed is obtainable only from

POLITICAL
We hope the Allies won’t now call it
Judastralia?
Exemption from war service is being
claimed by various “naturalised” young
Germans and a few Australian-born sons of
Germans. They protest that their enlist-
ment is “unthinkable.” If it is, then they
are in the wrong place. They ought to be
deported to the land of their physical or
spiritual birth, where they could try their
luck with claims to be exempted on . the
ground that bearing arms against Austra-
lians is “unthinkable.” What sort of a
reception would their plea get!
A WAY OUT
SQUATTER: “Well, ducky, we've lost the
Referendum?"
BLACKTRACKER: “By Gripe, Boss, you gibbit
sixpence, me plurry quick track ’ini.”
The boys in the trenches have found
another “No Man’s Land.” Its other name
is New South Wales.
N.S.W. Congregational Union did its
little bit to reinforce its cobber Isaac Moses:
People were urged to favor the totalisator be-
cause some of the profits would go to war widows
and orphans; but the Committee’s view was that
to aid them through a channel that involved the
ruin and misery of other homes would be un-
worthy of a Christian State.
The “other homes” to which the clean, hon-
est tote would bring ruin and misery being,
of course, the homes of the Congregational
Cnion’s friend the howling bookmaker.
Let us make a glad noise. There is still
one man with a big, cool brain left. He
wrote to the papers the other day suggesting
how Australia might win the war. “Let us
at once start building fleets of aeroplanes,”
lie shouted, “importing the necessary parts
to assemble on the premises, and immedi-
ately send 2000 trained aviators to the
Front.” This paper of course approves of
the importing part. But won’t it be a
bother to do the assembling ourselves? The
Empire can’t expect us to go on making
sacrifices all the time.
There’s many a true word spoken even
by legislators. They were leisurely chatting
over the Gaols Bill in Committee in the
Vic. Assembly the other afternoon when
Sinclair was moved to protest that under
existing law it was not possible for a man
serving a sentence to attend his parents
funeral. He had a case in mind where a
man was sentenced to 14 days. During that
time his mother died, but lie could not be
released to go and see her buried because
he had not served the greater part of his
sentence. That, he said, might happen to
any of them. Peacock’s cachinnation was
not specially noticeable in the subsequent
laughter. Perhaps he was thinking.
Among the odious lies which the antis cir-
culated in Victoria was one to the effect that
conscription would be a loss, not a gain, to
the men in the trenches because "it will in-
terfere with Australia’s ability to send them
munitions and equipment.” Of course, we
send them no munitions: we have no cannon
factories, no shell factories, no high-explosive
factories. We don’t even make hand-bombs.
We can- supply nothing of sterling value for
winning this artillery war save human
material —strong and active men. The antis
would stop this supply, or reduce it to a
vanishing quantity. They would keep the
cold-footed shirkers standing around on the
pretence that they are fighting for Freedom.
They would form a holy bond of nmon
between disloyalty and funk. And their
reason for doing it is, they say, their anxiety
to maintain the efficiency of a dwindling
Australian army beyond the seas. Liars
and hypocrites!
One of the poisonous stories with which
we drug ourselves every few weeks is that
“Germany is using up her last reserves- —it
is only a matter of a little time now.” Well,
a Melbourne woman lately received from an
Anzac the pay-book of a Hun soldier, which
he had picked up in a captured trench at
Pozieres. It sets forth that the owner is, or
was, Heinrich Hamm, single, laborer, E.C..
born at Hertzenvad, Prussia, on July 0,
1883. His number was 386, his pay 15.90
marks per month, he was reported “ready
for the field” on May 10, 1916, and he then
joined the Reserve battalion T.lv. 190, sta-
tioned at Kaiserwerth camp. Also the book
records that he was inoculated against
typhoid in August, 1915, and May, 1916.
8o the harassed, enfeebled Hun was calling
up unmarried laborers of 33 as late as last
May! Who said the Allies needed more
men ?
On the day after the flood: —
Hughes: I have nothing to say.
Pearce: Let us pray.
Kink O’Malley (nasally): Let us smootlge.
There never was a blockade that was worth
more than about tuppence. So much tobacco
has gone into Germany past - Britain’s
“blockade” of the Hun that the Imperial
Chancellor lately prohibited the import of
the raw leaf “in view of the great stocks
now held.” Holland is the chief conduit,
but Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland have
all been waiting on the big rich enemy—
and, of course, growing rich themselves.
The hope with which Britain was encouraged
to delude itself, that it could starve its
enemy into submission, is now about as dead
as P*. Pilate I. If we can’t hammer him
into submission, we will not lick him at
all. And, so far as Australia is concerned,
that means only one thing—men and more
men.
What has been happening to Hughes lately
recalls something that a fellow named Byron
wrote: —•
So the struck eagle stretched upon the plain,
No more through rolling clouds to soar again,
Viewed his own feather on the fatal dart
And winged the barb which quivered in his heart;
Keen were his pangs, but keener far to feel
He nursed the pinion that impelled the steel,
While the same plumage that had warmed his nest
Drank the last life-blood of his bleeding breast.
Talking to the annual conference of the
Vic. Municipal Assoc, in Melbourne the
other day, Works Minister Adamson men-
tioned an ancient grief:—
As he had often stated recently, there was no
doubt that many shires in the State were greatly
undervalued; some of them , had a rate which was
equivalent to only sd. in the £l.
But fortunately a strong Government is in
power, and is determined to deal drastically
with the shirking shires. According to Adam-
son, it won’t give them a penny this year to
make uo their shameful deficits. At least, it
won’t give them a penny more than
£158,000. .
From a politician’s Confession of Faith: —•
(1) The Lord made the earth and the fulness
thereof, and then he made Me.
(2) My business is to find out what the people
want, and whether they want Me to give it to them.
(3) If they don’t want Me they must be persuaded
that they made a mistake.
(4) When they get Me they must stick to it
because I won’t let them do anything else.
(5) I will do everything fer the people except get
off their backs.
(6) I am the great fact in evolution, for without
Me darkness would brood over the land and strange
josses be set up in the market place; and strange
josses are no good to me.
The State Frights insect buzzed horribly
when it was given out that the Common-
wealth steamers will be repaired in Sydney,
which possesses all the necessary docking
requisites. Adelaide
has no facilities, but
that trifling circum-
stance didn’t stop
Ivor MacGillivray, the
M.L.A. for the Port,
from wailing bitterly
about “our State”
being “deprived of its
share of the work,”
and all the rest of it.
And of course, be-
cause McGillivray has
a punch in the Labor
party, Blundell pro-
mised to rush through
a Bill authorising the
building of a graving
dock at Port Adelaide.
After which Port
Pirie will want to
know why Port
Adelaide should have
all the spoon-feeding;
and as it may be de-
sirable just at the
moment to spend a
few thousands in jobs
for disaffected Labor-
ites at Port Pirie,
Port Pirie will have
a graving dock, too.
Everybody ought tc
have a graving dock,
In fact, everybody
ought to have every-
thing that he doesn’t
have to pay for, and
the duty of a Govern-
ment is to see that he
gets it. But, heavens!
what a reckoning is coming !
They are cheerful bandits at Broken Hill-
Various members of the Yankee-German
I.WAV. being in trouble, for offences rang-
ing from murder and arson and banknote
forging to simple sedition, a collection was
made locally to pay for their defence; and the
business people of the town were notified
that they were expected to contribute- —a
simple notification with which the local
shopkeeper and tradesman is quite familiar
One man, perhaps more, declined to aid in the
defence of the murderers, banknote forgers,
etc. There was no way to directly punish
him for his treason, because he doesn't keep
a shop. However, the local Labor bodies
waited, and when the next races arrived they
notified the club that, as the scoundrel who
wouldn’t subscribe to defend the I.WAY.
patriots was the secretary, the meeting
would be boycotted—if the infamous secre-
tary wasn’t sacked. And the Government
looks on and thanks God that it is nearly
a thousand miles away and can’t therefore
be reasonably expected to do anything to
suppress this abominable tyranny!
THE ELIGIBLES.
FLO: “Ah, Maisie! Whatcher kidnappin’ —
mother’s only son or a reject?”
MAISIE: “Gam! ’E’s a married man.”
These wire-pullers have long memories. In
the N. S. Wales Railways Bill last week it
was proposed to give each of the numerous
Savings Bank trustees a free pass, and in
the lobbies it was urged that the titbit had
been promised by John See —the Sussex-
street Premier who died in the first years
of this century!
Any thoughtful patriot who took the ques-
tion of conscription seriously is entitled to
remark that all the “absolutely sincere’
Antis among the Labor brethren seemed. to
obtain their lights from their electioneering
advisors. For instance, when O’Malley
HIS PARDONABLE ERROR.

know —the place for loans.”
BACKBLOCKER: “Yes? Where the Gov’ment
meets, ain’t it?”
found that his was one of the few Labor
constituencies which would vote a decided
“Yes” he slunk into temporary silence and
endeavored to hide his light under a bushel.
Brother Catts, having declared himself a
conscriptionist whilst he was still stumbling
in the dark, became a sudden and violent
Anti as soon as his light burst upon him.
Catts’s light from Cook (N.SAV.) was a
three to one majority of Noes. The light
of Tudor, who retired early from the
Hughes Ministry when conscription was
mentioned, shone forth in a total of 21,441
Noes v. 8076 Yeses. But the light of
Mahon was “Yes,” so he held his tongue
instead of shrieking “No.” O’Malley and
his brother Antis took care to show no feel-
ing oil the matter of conscription except the
feeling that they wanted to keep right with
their constituents.
The advice of the dying Democrat to pos
terity: “Keep it out of the newspapers.”
Illuminating remark by Catts, M.H.8.:
One would think that now the campaign is over
misrepresentation would cease.
Evidently Catts regards misrepresentation
as an essential part of a political campaign.
Well, he ought to know.

GREED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The working man is liis own exploiter. No sooner
does he find himself, by increased wages, in posses-
sion of more money than he demands the choicest
cuts. Prices rise, etc. — Augus.
Piling his burdens thick upon himself,
Lashed by this unaccustomed goad of pelf,
The humble worker staggers on his way.
No longer does the doubtful sausage thrill,
And plain corned beef and carrots cannot fill
The longings of the meaner, baser clay.
Aping the grace of nobler, higher beasts,
Scorning his own predestined, lowly feasts,
He decks with choicest cuts his wretched plates,
Caring no whit that by his gorging thus,
The best may not now be reserved for us.
Money, it seems, both talks and educates!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This. is . the last war involving the world from
which America will keep aloof. —President H itsou.
Some time—maybe a thousand years away—
When China cocks her eye, and lights the world
With giddy lanterns, ready for affray
I shall arise, with chewing-gum unfurled,
And do my turkey-trot for liberty,
While jelly-fish go ragging on the sea.
Later, when I have built a shining wall
Of dollars round about my movie coasts,
And France, who perished that I might not fall,
Is but a circus of performing ghosts,
If war stirs Chaplin’s bones, I shall drop in
With many a cocktail cruiser for my kin.
Sure thing, old man. The next world-war I’ll help.
Not this. To-day I only hear trade yelp.

We invite all who contemplate the purchase of an automobile to go
to the nearest Hupmobile dealer and ask him to demonstrate, side by
side with ears of other makes, that the Hupmobile can do in ordinary
every-day use the things that other ears do only m demonstration.
Ask him to drive the car through crowded streets, up steep hills,
through deep sand or mud. See how easily and efficiently the Hupmobile
does these things.
.Notice at the same time the comfortable Hupmobile riding
qualities—the deep, soft cushions, the large tonneau, the absence of
vibration from the motor even at 50 or 60 miles an hour. Your eye
will appreciate Hupmobile beauty of design and finish.
Consider, too, that the Hupmobile has a four-cylinder motor that
will give you no trouble and many miles per gallon of petrol —that it
lias the strength and dependability of that first Hupmobile that went
around the world in 1909.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
I lie loud yell that was to have arisen
on Tuesday at Flemington stands postponed until
Saturday. This is the second time the Cup has been
shifted for’ard, the first occasion being in Nimble-
ioot s year. Cause—long, sustained rain, all,
lhe wetness which descended on the A.J.C.
Spring meeting having climbed back to the
clouds and hurried down to Melbourne to fall in
masses along the Yana. The adjournment may do
some of the horses good, but several nags that were '
punched along in searching gallops will not be.
improved by having the agony prolonged. Quinologist
lias come into the betting to a short price, and his
people are very confident, lie will run well. But
this page is not going to alter its view that Lingle,"
Shepherd King and Sasanof will be somewhere handy,
though it drops Kilboy and puts Wolaroi and Quinolo-
gist in the picture. Place ’em anyhow you like.
* * * *
The times registered at Flemington last
Saturday testified to the wetness of the course and
tlie upsettable character of the form. The Maribyr- '
nong Plate, which Pah King won from Erastus and
Franzac, was the slowest in 40 years; and the stake .
went to the youngster that was least troubled by the
sticky going. It was much the same in the Derby;
Wolaroi owed his win probably to the weather and its
ill-effects on one or two of the others. Certainly no
fair-weather expectations can he formed from the re-
sults of races run under the conditions that spoilt the
V.R.C. meeting last Saturday. Heavy going is not
even a test of stamina to the same degree that a time-
test is. A strong-limbed nag, which can outstay a •
dozen others when the track is heavy and a fast pace
is impossible, may be the first to fail for want of
speed when they are. all going their hardest on firm
ground. However, the hackers of Wolaroi could fairly
argue, after the V.R.C. Derby, that the colt beat Meh’i •
King over the muddy 12 furlongs as fairly as he beat ■
him in the Caulfield Guineas (they finished second and
third to the slippery Ettefred) when they travelled at
the.rate of about 7sec. faster per mile. Also Wolaroi’
had been a fast-finishing fourth in the Caulfield Cup—
in spite-of some very bad luck in the last furlong,
according to jockey Killorn’s account. So the punters -
and the hooks agree in fancying that Wolaroi has a
short-priced chance of winning the postponed Mel-
bourne Cup, though his Derby form, as far as it went, •
was* an argument in favor of Shepherd King, Amata
and Sasanof, the placed trio in Caulfield Cup.
Both Lavendo and Torbane came back to favor on
the strength of their running on Derby Day. Torbane
did well to finish third in the Hotham Handicap, and
Lavendo pipped Carlita in his best style at the finish
of the slow-run Melbourne Stakes. Of the two per-
formances Torbane was the better trial for the Cup—
at the weights.
Hotpot Kilboy was a dismal failure in the Derby.
The- big colt had at least been in front at the dis-
tance in the Caulfield Cup (9 furlongs) when
Lavendo streaked past him and won by two lengths.
The excuse on that occasion was that McLachlan, who
dropped his whip, had ridden Kilboy badly through-
out the race. Mac’s statement of the case cast the
blame upon the ’orse. After winning the A.J.C.
Derby and losing the Caulfield Stakes on the highly-
rated quadruped, the jockey said he was as sluggish
in a race as he appears in the birdcage. Kilboy
wants riding all the time, and his 2min. 39fsec. vic-
tory in the Sydney Derby proves nothing except that
he was better than Wolaroi and Easteourt a month
ago. McLachlan punched the big clumsy fellow along
to the hitter end at Randwick, since when his opti-
mistic owners have thought the world of him. But
because the brilliant Lavendo made their massive
animal look commonplace, they changed the rider for
the Derby. This cost them an extra fee, Mac having
been engaged to repeat the Randwick victory when
he came to Melbourne. And whom did they choose
to punch Kilboy along this time? Young Dempsey,
tlie lightweight, who looked rather like the prover-
bial tomtit on a round of beef when he took his pre-
liminary. “The going’s too heavy,” said Dempsey.
But it had been heavy enough at Randwick when the
older and stronger jockey induced Kilboy to do his
best. On Saturday the favorite ran as though he
was tired or sulky. A little of each perhaps. Kilboy
is not a gee of a vivacious disposition. Probably he
has an uncertain temper when pressui’e is applied,
and is not a wonder when quite amiable.
Bursar, who had gone wrong before The Bulletin
was printed last week, was stalled in the birdcage
as though he might take his chance in the Melbourne
Stakes. Whatever is the matter with Bursar didn’t
show itself when he was walking or standing around.
* * * *
“Mujilt”: Wolaroi’s win in the Derby was
not unexpected by many racing men in Sydney, especi-
ally after the improved showing- made by the colt at
Caulfield. Wolaroi is an exceptionally good-winded
animal, and requires comparatively light treatment
on the track. His trainer is always very careful
of him in this respect; nevertheless between the
meeting at Rosehill, where he won the Guineas, and
at Randwick he began to show signs of weariness,
and he was a good deal below form in the A.J.C.
Derby. The running in that race could not
by the wildest stretch of imagination he taken as
representing the relative merits of Kilboy and Seaton’s
animal, as The Bulletin several times mentioned.
Impressive though the Maorilander’s win seemed to
be, the proximity to him of the half-rine Easteourt
and the spectacle of a brilliant colt like Wolaroi
tailed away astern showed that the last word had
not been spoken. There is a possibility that
Kilboy at Flemington was not the horse he was
at Randwick and that the going was against him.
But this would merely prove that he is not so
much better than Wolaroi as some people thought
tlie running at Randwick proved. The odds Kilboy
started at on Saturday were ridiculous if measured
by the horse’s performance. At his best Wolaroi
must always be hard to catch. His winnings are
now over £lO,OOO.
* * * *
“H. 8.”: Here’s a tip for Saturday.
Ambrose Pratt has had a racing novel on the book-
stalls for vears, and it is still selling—“Wolaroi’s
Cup.”
* * * *
Most Melbourne punters reckon it ought to
be spelled Kiljoy.
* * * *
The most surprising animal in the V.R.C.
Derby was Mehi King (Mountain King—Lady Mehi),
who ran second. This colt has had four runs. The
first was at Rosehill a few months ago, when he was
beaten by a head in a novice event. Then he came to
light at Randwick, putting in a remarkable dash
down the straight and beating’ Mafioso in the Mem-
bers’ Handicap. In the Caulfield Guineas he shaped
well, being' next to Ettefred and Wolaroi. Mehi King
is the property of Randwick trainer H. Robinson,
who has kept the wolf from the door with great
success this season, mainly with the assistance of
Hopfield, Merrimee and co.
* * * *
Pah King, winner of the Maribyrnong
Plate on Saturday, had a cut in the Breeders’ Plate
at Randwick, and though Baltic Sea and Modesto
arrived ahead of him he shaped as if he would get
over the ground a bit more rapidly next time. Pali
King was bred at Mungie Mungie (N.S.W.), and at
the last Easter sales was exchanged for £5OO to a
Bananaland buyer. The Maribrynong was worth about
£1250 to the winner.
* * * *
The placing in the Dundas Handicap at
Rosehill (Sydney) on Saturday caused furious argu-
ment. Nearly everybody was satisfied that Maid
of Seville was first, Long Reef second and My Palm
third. But My Palm was declared by the judge to
be the winner, and Maid of Seville was given third
money. The crowd may have been correct, but the
writer knows from experience that the angle at
Rosehill is very deceptive, and as a result is pre-
pared to stand on the side of the man in the box
who has a clear view at right-angles.
Two horses from Northern N. S. Wales
won races at Rosehill on Saturday—Machine Boy and
Wirrilla. Machine Boy, who appropriated the big
event, wasn’t fancied much, judging by his price in
a small field, but Wirrilla was favorite. Machine
Boy had been taking life easily since he captured
the last Anniversary Handicap, and probably sur-
prised the people behind him on Saturday by the
forwardness of his condition. Wirrilla is the pro-
perty of Mr. W. Fletcher, of Tamworth, who brought
off a big coup by winning Epsom and Metropolitan
double of 1907 with Silver Hampton and Eric.
Another good performer of his was Fend, which after
landing a couple of events as a three-year-old broke
down.
Once a year old sports swap reminiscences
of Melbourne Cup happenings. In 1881, which was
Zulu’s year, a dog got among the horses and caused
trouble, with the result that the grey Suwarrow
bumped against the rails and broke a leg of his
rider, Dodd, who died soon afterwards. Two years
previously the same Suwarrow had run third to
Darriwell. Chester, the winner in 1877, brought his
rider to grief the next year. The horse fell, and
Morrison suffered injuries from which he never quite
recovered. Two years later Chester had another try
and finished sixth. A favorite subject for discourse
with the old identities is the late George Watson,
“prince of starters,” as the pressmen called him.
'Watson was an unduly-glorified official in the days
when he used to “take the field in hand” and dis-
charge swear words at the boys who wanted to get a
break or schemed to get left at the post; but the
starting-machine came along, and the glory of George
AVatson departed. Patron’s year (1894) was the
first time a Melbourne Cup field was lined up to the
barrier. The start was so much better than anything
Watson had achieved on his princely own that even
the ancient Tories thought there must be something
in this new-fangled idea after all. But they still
argue, with some force, that the machine is faulty
in so far that it cannot recall the field when two or
three horses are badly left.
*■ * * *
Maoriland owner Stead appears to have
invaded the Commonwealth with more horse than
horse-sense. Anyhow, the owner of valuable nags who
has to be always running round looking for someone
to climb on to them is taking big chances. Stead's
troubles with the human element in his campaign
have been continual. One jockey he engaged in Aus-
tralia got passed down after Stead had passed him
over. Another was engaged, and after a while Stead
was'rushing about looking for somebody else. Inci-
dentally he telegraphed to Maoriland for a horse-
man, and after a day or two telegraphed him not to
come, and then sent him some more telegram to leave
at once. Whereupon the diminutive person stayed at
home. Having prescribed himself an abrupt change
of trainer and much worry iockeys, ft looks
as if Stead is the kind of youth who might at any
moment, after declaringgl3st. 71b. overweight; leap
on one of his prads and argue the point with the
astonished animal himself. But that was one of the ;
things old-man “Gee Gee” Stead never had to bother
about. That wise old tactician always had the correct
piece of meat to put on the scales.
* * * *
“0.K.”: The death of Etty de Mestre
the other week was another reminder of how healthy
is the business of horse-ti'aining. It causes the
trainer to be up with the lark, and keeps him moving
in the early-morning air, in the saddle or afoot. De
Mestre, as every turf schoolboy knows, was trainer of
the gee that won the .first two Melbourne Cups—
-1861-2. And though he was 84 when he died he is
survived by old Jimmy Wilson, who owned and
trained the mare Alusidora that ran second in the
third Melbourne Cup, and was unplaced in the three
succeeding ones. De Mestre, by the way, had two
representatives in the original Melbourne Cup race.
He started a gelding called Inheritor as well as
Archer, the winner. But he didn’t lead the winner
in, as was stated in a recent Bulletin. He just sent
the horses over from N. S. AVales in charge of Tom
Lamond, for the Melbourne Cup was not a prize to
run after in 1861, nor could there have been much
betting on it. It was “a handicap of 20 sovs. for
starters, 10 sovs. or 5 sovs. if declared,” and the
number of persons present was estimated at 4000.
Next year the young club added 200 sovs. to the
stake, and in 1865 a piece of plate, value 100 sovs.,
was thrown in. The V.R.C. was then known as the
Victorian Turf Club. But this comment on the
longevity of horse-trainers is growing too historical.
The death of Mrs. William Budge at
Coloola, where she had resided for half a century,
brings to light the fact that her husband is still
living, aged 82. He was a noted horseman in his
time, and won the first Bathurst Cup on the
steeplechaser Jack Donohoe.
* * * *
The lately-defunct sire Birkenhead was
imported to the Ivaramu Stud (M.L.), where Robinson
Crusoe and Dreadnought blood courses through the
veins of a couple of hundred brood mares. There is
so much for a sire to do at this big Hawkes Bay farm
that the animal never gets a chance outside; other-
wise the big Orme horse might have gone down to
turf history among the really great ones. The
present M.L. studbook is plastered from introduc-
tion to imprint with the names of his stock. In
1912 he had no less than 42 mares in the list, second
only to Stepniak with 60. Almost everything he got
had a fair measure of pace. Zimmerman was the star
performer. Woodhey was a queen of pot-boilers,
but she was notoriously lucky when the weights
were adjusted. Once in her career she won a pro-
vincial cup with Bst. 61b. Three months after she
secured another of the same articles with Bst. 4lb on
top. Practically the same horses were in both races,
and the two courses were about 50 miles .apart.
About two yeairs back Birkenhead was sold to make
room for King Mark and Hymettus, The last-named
seems to be going to make a name as father of some
of the worst-named prads in the universe —Hyttus,
Hyettius and so on. Ugh!
* * * *
“Barcoo” : S. Aus. has a supply of buck-
jump riders, but they get on the saddle more frequently
than into print. One of them, Chas. Greig, of Wero-
cata (Balaklava), handled a thousand young horses for
GEORGE GRAY,
billiardist, just back
from London.
India in three years
and never had a fall
except when the nag
came down. Later in
Calcutta ho won a
medal from the Wirth
Bros., competing with
some of Australia’s
best. William Hatton,
of the Upper Darling,
was a big man but a
great horseman. Once
on a station which he
owned with E. B. L.
Dickens (son of
Charles) his mount
collapsed and a broken
leg had to be ampu-
tated. By a strange
coincidence his son
met the same fate, and
afterwards it was not
uncommon to see
father and son hand-
ling and breaking
young horses, with
only two natural legs
between them.
Every decent sport in Sydney got that
tired feeling last week when an evening paper
hurried out with the intelligence: “There is certain
evidence which goes to show that Darcy had a shave
in Newcastle on Friday morning.” What an intoler-
able world it would be if champion boxers lasted
as long as favorite actresses!
• * * *
Tommy Uren (Sydney) and Herb McCoy
(Melb.) had another go on Saturday near the Yarra,
this time for the welter title. It was a one-sided dis-
aster. Thomas had all the best of the argument both
in fighting and boxing, and in the fourth collision
handed over his right with so much violence that
when Herbert accepted delivery on the jaw he forgot
to return thanks and passed into the land o’ dreams.
* # * *
Bill Lang and Bill Squires are seriously
threatening to come back into the ring. This seems
an altogether excessive quantity of Bill. Still, it
would be the fun o’ the world if the mislaid punch
was discovered, and the Bill who is otherwise Squires
became champion Australian heavyweight.
* * * *
How much battering can the optic nerve
stand? Joe Shugrue, the American lightweight who
was punching here two or three years ago, lost his
eyesight last year, and his friends thought it was a
long good-night. But there is now a glimmer of
hope, though Joe will never again dance beneath
the arcs that blaze above the realm where bash is
king.
* * * *
An excellent comedy was staged at Hobart
when N. S. Wales pug Jack Darcy, who holds the
heavyweight championship of the Speck, had a
leisurely and genteel argument with Victorian Pat
Doran. Both took the contest as a rather weary joke,
and though each did a good deal of terrific swinging
most of it fell on the atmosphere. After five fits of
the exhibition the referee announced that Bro. Doran
had dislocated his shoulder, and that Bro. Darcy was
therefore the winner. The announcement provoked
the crowd to rapturous and prolonged boo-hoos.
* * * *
When Messrs. Patsy Brannigan (U.S.A.)
and Sid Godfrey (N.S.W.) ended their campaign at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday the verdict given by
Arthur Scott in Patsy’s favor provoked the crowd to
great wrath. The job of amassing points in boxing
is a mysterious business, and this page is not going
to argue about it. But if Brannigan can win any
more scraps in the same way the writer will eat his
wife’s hat, pins and all. Godfrey is the better , per-
former by a considerable margin. It was a very used-
up Brannigan who found out that he was not the
loser. *
* * * *
No, Darcy was not at Melbourne on Mon-
day. Art Magill obliged George Chip instead, and
George, relieved of the necessity for standing up to
another hiding, joyously passed Art out in the
fourteenth.
Wave Geike and Eugene Volaire struggled
in a lurid atmosphere for 12 rounds at Brisbane on
Saturday night, and then the Frenchman hurried to
the rear for repairs. Contact with Gcike’s head in
the seventh round let daylight through his upper lip,
and his most urgent desire thereafter was to get the
business over.
L. Fisher made a splash among Botany
(N.S.W.) club championships the other day, by
winning the 100yds. (10 4-ssec), 220yds (25 4-ssec.),
440yds. (65 l-10sec.), and 880yds .(2 min. 18 4-ssec.).
As a sprinter Fisher is likely to play a large part
in future State championships. In the more
strenuous events, J. Thomasson did best. He heaved
the 161 b. shot 31ft. B£in. and induced the 12U>.
hammer to cover 87ft. lOin.
For the fifth time in succession Scotch
College has won the running champion ship among the
public schools in Vic. At last week’s sports the
school record for a mile was reduced to 4mm.
37 l-ssec. and the long jump was broadened to
21ft, For the first time breaking at the start was
punished by a pass-out order and jostling met with
disqualification. Quite right, too. If it is never too
late to mend it is never too early to learn.
“Glen H.”: Our Melbourne suburb the
other day acquired a recreation club and bowling
green. In introducing the Mayor at the opening cere-
mony the president informed the ratepayers: “And
when the Mayor has'finished speaking you will be able
to enjoy yourselves.”
* * * *
Gunner Bryan Gootlbeliere, who recently
died in France, was the best of a family of athletes.
In his college clays at Wellington (M.L.) he broke all
running records from lOOyds. to a mile and estab-
lished new figures for the long jump. He was a fine
footballer, and played with the University team which
toured Australia. In 1909 Goodbehere met the world-
champion Duffy at Wellington. Duffy conceded the
Maorilander 1-j yard start, and leaping away off the
mark established a good lead; but the local man
caught him again and won on the post. He was pur-
suing the Law when he dashed to the Front.
* * * *
B. J. Folkard, who smote the first cen-
tury of the season in Sydney premiership on Satur-
day, is an all-rounder who might have been one of
the Ma State’s top-notcliers. In the 1915-16 season
he amassed 436 runs, averaging 27.35, and took 33
wickets for 20.93 each. He is captain of Balmain.
This and Sydney are the only undefeated teams after
two rounds of premiership play.
* * * *
Sydney bowler O. Y. Grimmett on Satur-
day stuck to his habit of capturing six wickets in an
innings, knocking over that number for 57 runs
against Petersham. Three times last season Grim-
mett gathered half a dozen wickets in one innings
and eight wickets in another. G. Dailey, of Erskine-
ville, in two matches this season has knocked over
17 for 58 runs. Dailey was a promising junior last
year; and it looks as if he deserved the invitation

Australian cyclists had nothing to com-
plain of in the division of the Yankee racing spoil
last season. R. J. McNamara (N.S.W.) topped the
list of 22 first-class riders with 10 wins and 21
places; Alf Goullet (Vic., hut now in America)
came third with seven wins and five places. Other
Australians in the list were Alf Grenda (Tas.)
fourth, Bob Spears (N.S.W.) sixth, F. Corry
(N.S.W.) tenth, O. A. Piercey (Vic.) twelfth, Jackv
Clark (Vic., now a Yank citizen) fourteenth, and
G. Walker (Vic.) twentieth.

Everybody cannot tell one pigeon from
another, but a Port Kembla (N.S.W.) fancier has a
bird he knows fairly well by sight. This bird has
raced home first to Wollongong from Bundanoon, Bina-
long, Marulan, Cootamundra and Hay. This last trip
is over an air line of 350 miles. The homing instinct
of carrier pigeons is a marvellous trait never really
understood, but since man learned to fly the value
of the pigeon has decreased, except among the ghouls
of the gun clubs.

The dangers of bowls are growing every
year. Something will have to be done. On a Sydney
rir.k the other day a player drove his ball with
such force that a sparrow dining off a grub was
unable to get out of the line of fire and suffered fatal
injuries. The incident created a profound sensation
and the old ’uns are now getting measured for steel
helmets and shin pads.

Practical Adelaide again. The Register
lately made a startling heading of a “deathtrap” to
motorists and others, a “very dangerous” hole in the
main road from Adelaide just where it tops the hills
at Mount Lofty. There was “unpardonable neglect”
on the part of the local authorities; in short, some-
body ought to do something. Next day, before
authority could stir its leisurely self, a local resi-
dent had got a horse and cart, broken the necessary
stone, and filled up the hole. He was an old-age pen-
sioner, close on 90. The Automobile Association sent
him a guinea and three cheers.

A weird joke was fixed up lately by an
Army Service lot in Egypt. They were struck by
the number of famous cricket names amongst them.
So they arranged a match with a neighboring unit,
and then stunned the opposition by posting this
as their team: Hill, J. Darling, E. Jones, S. Reed-
man, Campbell, Hopkins, Faulkner, McLaren,
Humphreys, Young and Taylor. In the matter of
cricket capacity these were of course merely names,
though some of them came as near as being rela-
tives of the real thing; but they were real names,
and all of the bearers were available as players.
Also they were all S. Australians. It recalls an
old true yarn of the days, something over 20 years
ago, just before Hill and Darling blossomed out for
S. Aus. The Civil Service in Melbourne and Adel tide
was arranging for a cricket match, and the former,
being the usual sort of a scratch team, had the
forethought to ask if they would meet anything out
of the common. Adelaide at once supplied the
names of Giffen and Reedman (Post Office), Lyons
(Taxation), “Jonah”! Jones (Public Works), and
Blinman (Chief Secretary). And these were about
all-that-mattered in the State team which had lately
won for S.A. the Sheffield Shield. Melbourne made
only two comments. One was satirical, asking by
what oversight Jarvis (S.A.’s international wicket-
keeper) had been left out. The other was practical:
“We scratch.”

NOW.

D°, YOU KNOW the importance of rich blood? It will be evident
when you consider that the entire system derives its nourishment
from the blood.
When the blood is poor in quality and unable properly to perform
its function, the system becomes starved.
The sufferer complains of exhaustion, lassitude, loss of appetite
and depression —he is debilitated.
He will continue to suffer until his blood is enriched and strengthened.
■This is when Iron ‘Jclloids, ’ The Reliable Tonic, are neeaed to
enrich and strengthen the blood.
As the blood becomes restored to its normal condition, strength and
energy return —one feels fit and w’ell.
Dr. Andrew Wilson wrote: —“Impoverished blood can be
“made rich and good by means of Iron ‘Jelioids’ the
“most effective and desirable treatment.”

LL AUSTRALIANS visiting London
should read- the British Austral-
asian, (id. weekly —an illustrated paper
containing mail and cable news from Aus-
tralia, and news of Australians in Europe
ai.d at home. Australians are cordiallv in-
vited to visit the British Australasian
Reading Room at the Oflices, 115 High Hot-
born, London, W.C., where they can see the
home papers, meet tlieir frienas, tne

“ J.F.11.” : Percy Grainger, the Australian
composer, has been successful in his new
line of musical manufacture. 11 is “Clog
Dance: Handel in the Strand.pioduced on
the opening night of the new series of
Promenade Concerts in London Queen’s
Hall, was remarkably well received and
loudly applauded by a crowded audience. It
is an ingeniously constructed medley of the
humorous and the serious, based on Handel’s
familiar “Harmonious Blacksmith.” Sir
Henry Wood’s Queen’s Hall orchestra
played the high-spirited thing in very
sprightly style.
When some of Botha’s S*Africans cap-
tured Luderitzbucht in German South-West
Africa they found a disabled moving-pic-
ture machine and a supply of Hun films.
The engineers tinkered up the machine and
the wearied campaigners invited General
Blank and themselves to the first biograph
show anyone had seen for a long time. The
General had had a heavy day, and the peace
and shadow of the hall defeated him very
quickly. He was asleep before the operator
started to turn the handle, and he continued
to snore while the machine hosed the screen
with stuff that would have made the camp
camels blush. The soldiers were just start-
ing to get used to it when a burst of
laughter woke the chief. He rubbed his
eyes and sat up straight to see the joke,
fine amazed glance and he was on his feet
shouting, “Burn the things. Burn them!”
Pleading cries of “On, no, sir!” from all
round. “Burn them, I say!” The machine
wavered and shut off, the show broke up
and, later, a pile of German art flamed in
the night like a torch of righteousness.
Thereafter moral films were sent up for the
troops while they remained in camp.
Melba will llh glad to know that one Vic-
torian magistrate, at any rate, is helping her
to rid the city of the smudge of being musi-
cally starved. He has just decided that it is
sacrilege to steal a Salv’army cornet, and
has sent a man to gaol on that charge.
Cynthia Latham, pretty daughter of Aus-
tralian-born Cynthia Brooke, has learnt how
to walk under the spotlight in the United
Stationery. New York has admired her in
comedy, bellowdrama, Shakspeare and musi-
cal-comedy parts, and London will presently
see her for the first time in a little more
musical comedy.
From London: Oscar Asche has joined
up with General Smith-Dorrien, and
says that a number of current and
recent productions are “solely put on as an
excuse for disrobing.” He adds that revues
in which girls undress piece by piece are
“simply pandering to indecent minds.”
Alfred Butt, who runs the Empire and the
Palace: whejre Gaby Deslys and other foreign
damsels pose in as few clothes as possible,
denies that there is any substantial ground
for the General’s aspersions. Oswald Stoll,
who directs the Coliseum, the Alhambra and
the Opera House, admits that: there was “a
type of entertainment” not long ago which
deserved the General’s strictures, but it was
stamped out by the prompt action of the Lord
Chamberlain’s Department. “Details,” he
cries—“get down to details !” But he knows
that, nothing is more difficult than to do it.
We have had shows that have simply reeked.
And yet had you been asked to say what
reeked you could oiily reply, “the atmo-
sphere.”
“II.”: The year didn’t pass without the
usual Shakspearian Festival at Stratford-on-
Avon. Knight Benson and his wife being busy
on war work, veteran Ben Greet and his
colleagues from the “Old Vic.” in South
London made very respectable understudies.
Ben in bis speech of thanks on the closing
night made reference to Walter. Bentley.
They had. lie said, produced 12 plays in 15
days, which wasn’t a bad record in times when
actors and actresses did not expect to work
as hard as they had to when he was young.
Many years ago he was engaged by Walter
Bentley to join his co. in the north of Scot-
land, and in that co. they did IS different
plays in three weeks. On the day he left
the co. Frank Benson joined it, and, poor
chap, found to his dismay that he had to mop
up some 23 parts, including several doubles.
Died in England, aged 52, Janet Achurch.
who was the first English mummeress to play
Ibsen. It was not until 1889 that Nora
first slammed the door of her doll’s house in
London, although the play was written 10
years earlier. George Rignold brought tlfe
actress to Australia in 1891, and she played
Lady Macbeth and other Shakspearoines,
Nora Ilelmer and Hedda Gabler. Of late
years London had seen her only in special
productions by the Stage Society, which on
Sundays performs plays that the Censor
considers too wicked for week days.
PICTURE SHOW MUSIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
And, passing by a picture-show.
I heard a hopeless cornet blow,
And painted for myself the scene
Then flickering upon the screen:
The Disappointed Wife with eyes
As large as basins (half-crown size) :
The “close-up” view—the two-quart tear
Cascading down her cheek ; the dear,
Sweet Baby (six-feet long this one,
And strong enough to hold a gun) ;
The actor-husband, fat and white,
Making grimaces left and right,
Working his arms and eyebrows, too,
As only picture-actors do.
1 do not see these things, you know ; .
1 only heard that cornet blow
Sad gurgles from its filmy lair
That told me what was passing there.
I hurried past on eager feet;
The lighting engine's gasping beat
Grew fainter in the night. The howls
Of that sad cornet sank to growls.
For pictures shows I never pay—
The music gives the show away!

The Goodyear All-Weather Tread
Has Several Distinct Advantages.
FIRST ADVANTAGE.
The extra thickness of the tread prevents most punctures.
Some manufacturers make a non-skid tyre simply by forming a
design on the tread with scarcely any added rubber. The rubber
in the projections on Goodyear All-Weather Treads is extra. The
regular tread thickness is preserved under the blocks.
SECOND ADVANTAGE.
Many tread cuts which would ordinarily pelietrate to the fabric
are avoided by the big heavy projections on these treads.
THIRD ADVANTAGE.
The sharp-edged projections grip the ground firmly and offer
maximum resistance against skidding. The projections on most
other non-skid treads have rounding surfaces. The edges of the
blocks in the Goodyear All-Weather Tread are sharp.
FOURTH ADVANTAGE.
Even when the projections in the centre of the Goodyear All-
Weather Tread are worn down there is still a substantial tread
left, the edge of the side blocks is practically intact.
FIFTH ADVANTAGE.
The projections on the All-Weather Tread overlap and are
placed symmetrically. This makes the car run smoothly as with
plain treads. ‘ SIXTH ADVANTAGE.
The projections on the Goodyear Tyre spread out at the base
so that the strain of road contact is distributed over the carcase.
Any one of these advantages would place the Goodyear All-
Weather Tread far above all competitors—-all of them in the one
tyre place that tyre in a class by itself.

Muscular
and
Chronic
Rheumatism,
Lumbago,
Sciatica and
Gout
are all due to an excess of Uric Acid, Lactic
Acid or Phosphates in the system. These im-
purities are generally caused by Chills, working
in damp places, or over-eating and excessive
drinking which overloads the organs and retards
them from doing their functions thoroughly
KILLRHEU
FOR RHEUMATISM
at once neutralises and removes the excess of
actds, the Kidneys become more active, the
Bowels are stimulated, the excruciating pains in
the joints and muscles are relieved, and the for-
mation of chalky deposits in gout is prevented.
Read the following testimonial it is full of
Thankful Praise.
Dear Sirs,—l wish to say briefly and earnestly how
thankful I am for the wonderful results effected by the
use of Killrheu. For many months I suffered intense
agony from Rheumatic pains, sleepless nights, and
general weakness. The results are marvellous. After
taking one bottle every pain and ache has gone. I now
sleep soundly and my appetite is excellent.

BOOTS are the smart wear for the season
—Dame Fashion has cast that die most
decisively—-and this white poplin boot,
fashionable, short-fronted, with a trim,
military heel, will look uncommonly well with
the short white skirts of this season. Then,
better still, like all the short-fronted models
in the Bostock range, it is quite amazingly
comfortable, and will suit all types of feet. In
fact, most women will get a pleasant surprise
when they try it on, and see how nice it looks
and how delightful it feels. And it will con-
tinue to feel delightful in wear, since all
Bostock soles are specially treated so as to
extract from them those chemicals used in
tanning, which are apt to make the feet hot
and tired. So, in this boot one will be
dainty, cool and fresh, able to enjoy walks,
picnics and excursions in the most blazing
weather.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Wo notice (except oj a hostile character ) will he

Name and address must appear on the MSS. A’o
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Alpha : This paper is produced by seven de-
partments. It wouldn’t be what it is it' every one of
those departments didn’t put its own job first. And
that's how we regard this Empire question. Onr
Imperial job. is to do our best with Australia....
Wee Mac: Thanks: but he is Lite. Dozens have
done it down here.... Bill E. T.: That yarn took
a very long time to get round to you. .. .David O’C.:
Somebody else was ahead with that railway par....
P. Pot: (1) It would be something like a tragedy
if during the next few years Australia, in order to
escape a closer political union with Britain, should
become an independent republic. (2) What Aus-
tralia will eventually become nobody can guess.
(3) The Bi lletin' looks forward to changes in the
status of Australia in the dim, remote future and to
the time when Australia will be able to stand on her
own feet. . . .Pelagios: Mere insanity. .. .G.M.: Can’t
get any sense out of it. Should call it the “Muddled
West”... .G.M.: Some promise. Don’t leave out
the alternate rhymes. . . .J.H.: No good J.M.M.:
“Dead Love deserves to be dead if you’re as careless
in writing about it as all that.... J.1.M.: Metre
out; rhymes bad; sense mixed; ideas spavined....
Melos: Not up, and a bit grimy... .R.M.: It may
be a “War Poein,” but it looks to us like plain
doggerel.... G.R.H.: We’ll forgive and forget with-
out putting you through any of those gymnastics
Mick: Your verse is improving, but- your morals
don’t seem on the up-grade... .li.: Not a glimmer
in it... .L.V.8.: Idiocy... .C.V.11.: Feeble pun died
of its own inanity... .M.P.; “Betrayed” is mere
hysteria... .E.P.0.: Everything original in the
article could have been better said in an eight-line
paragraph.... Bellerive: It has the old charm. We
like that under-and-over effect :
. . ..W.M.8.: Too long- for interest... .L.L.L.: Much
too diffuse and loosely constructed for u5....K.A.:
*o froth on that beer....S. Gum: Don’t feel dis-
posed to attack the theory. Gold is all over-valued
article. It isn’t the basis of credit. Ask any old
banker. He’ll tell you how important character is.
And it’s the same with a public as with a private
borrower. .. .M.E.W.: Story theme commonplace,
though well handled; hijc the local color isn’t Aus-
tralian. .. .Myponga: Nothing in them . ..Lonsdale-
yan: Poor stuff Gham. -V- use G.L.: Without
a gleam and with no constructive skill C.11.V.:
Lame prose tortured into a pretence of verse....
R.L.W.: You have our sympathy, but verse too crude.
.. . . J.D.: No merit. .. .Redeo : There’s an idea in it,
but no skill Krocus : Awful J.T.: “Speck” is
lame in head and feet Tere: Too thin this time
Rushbush: Get ink !. .. . W.X.R.: A sonnet doesn’t
consist of 15 lines; and the verse is very middling,
even if it kept to the rules of the. game....
R. .J.H.C.: A crime like that is past forgiveness....
A.L.8.: No Ecrivain: You’ve left out the vitriol.
. ...M.8.P.: Neither verse nor prose... .J.D.H.:
“Yes” yarn too hysterical. People are not such
asses as all that.... Coyyan: Verse hopeless. Black-
fellow lore a basis for interesting work if you had
kill to put it together 0.M.: You might sell
Episode” somewhere else. Not our style... .G.E.L.:
Yarn thin; verse bumps along... .Robartus De: On
the look of the things you must try many times yet
before it passes our “fatherly eye.”... .Daybreak:
That harpoon stoiy used to be a good one.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
S.T.: They're all sad little scratching*....
E.S.McG.: It's still a long way to acceptance. .. .W.M. :
Copying is hardly a test, but if he’s interested give
him a chance... .L.L.: Oh, these slack-moment ideas !
. ...G.L.H.: It isn’t a very amusing remark....
W.K.: It is sad to think that you did it while you
might have accomplished some washing, or carted
bricks, or planted a few cabbages.
“Corpus Delicti”: How are you off for
body-snatching records? A Richmond (Vic.)
constable, .7. T. Lawrence, who does
it with his little grappling-iron, is nomi-
nated for the championship of the
Yarra. Says he: “I have recovered some
hundreds of corpses from the river in, my
time. Of course I am an expert dragger
and am usually called upon for such work,
but I am always coming upon corpses. I
suppose I get 19 out of every 20 in this dis-
trict. It is just luck —if you can call it
that.”
“Fax" : The docile Chow market gardener
and furniture-maker is a producer, at any
rate. The Greek, even if he isn’t disloyal, is
certainly not a producer. He and his brethren
are just a conspiracy of greasy, insolent
middlemen, leagued together to secure a
monopoly of the best stands in the big cities
and to maintain a system of cunning fraud
in their fruit and fish dealing. Only a small
percentage of the prosperous Greek traders
are employers of Australian labor, although
their shops and saloons nowadays are often
disguised under Australian names. The
swarthy parasites run their unclean shows
with the aid of kindred aliens, and employ
their poorer brethren as hawkers. In White
Australian circles the question is always
being asked—Why have the Greeks got con-
trol of trades which had become disrepu-
table in their hands? The apparent mystery
is explained by a combination of reasons.
The clannishness of an unlovable alien race
is one reason. Their natural dishonesty in
window-dressing is another reason. The
foolish anclannishness of pro-British Aus-
tralian customers is, of course, the last and
chief reason. Whereas all aliens prefer to
buy from aliens, the average Australian is
not loyal to his own race in little matters of
business. When there is a persistent demand
for White Australian fruitshops and restau-
rants the Greeks will have to retire from
business and get work. But not until then.
The demand must create the supply, or the
Greeks will continue to fatten on their
monopoly.
Over the bridge rumbled a gardener’s cart
On its way to the market place,
hile under the bridge lay a starving man
With a pallid and" sunken face;
Over the bridge sped a motor-car
On its way to some grand homestead;
While under the bridge moaned a dying rnan
With no home to lav his head.
Over, the bridge at busy morn the
Stir of traffic did sound,
AVhile under the bridge the ill-fated one
Lay lifeless upon the ground.

Cleans as it Polishes’ ’
Go over any piece of furniture or woodwork, with your rag treated with
O-Cedar and polish with a dry cloth. See how O-Cedar cleans, dusts,
polishes and really beautifies all at one time.
O-Cedar produces a hard, dry, gloss-like lustre or polish that is
lasting. This lustre is retained if you put a few drops of O-Cedar
on your dust-cloth as you use it daily.

TO GROW HAIR ON A BALD HEAD.
By A SPECIALIST.
Thousands of people suffer from baldness
and falling hair who, having tried nearly
every advertised hair tonic and hair grower
without results, have resigned themselves to
baldness and its attendant discomforts. Yet
their case is not hopeless; the following
simple home prescription has made hair grow
after years of baldness, and is also unequalled
for restoring grey hair to its original color,
stopping hair from falling out, and for de-
stroying the dandruff germ. It will not
make the hair greasy, and can be put up by
any chemist: —Bay Rum, 30z.; Lavona de
Composee, loz.; Menthol Crystal, ? dram. If
you wish it perfumed, add half to one tea-
spoonful of French Fon Fleur Perfume,
which unites perfectly with the other ingredi-
ents. This preparation is highly recom-
mended by physicians and specialists, and is.
absolutely harmless, as it contains none of
the poisonous wood alcohol so frequently
found in hair tonics. Do not apply to face
or where hair is not desired. — Advt.

IN
BANANA LAND
A few days ago the secretary of a Bris-
bane Labor organisation was charged with
having assaulted a well-known conscription-
ist at a city recruiting meeting. The arrest-
ing constable deposed that the accused said
to him: “But you’re a member of a union,
too, aren’t you ? You wouldn’t arrest a
union secretary, would you?” But the
union John Hop did run him in ; then a union
lawyer prosecuted him; finally a magistrate
who had been a unionist fined him in a
large and generous way. The union game
doesn’t always pan out according to expecta-
tions.
Twelve months’ jamboree and an empty
cash-box do not deter Ryan and his Min-
isters, who are now providing for these new
gilded jobs: A new Judge of the Arbitration
Court at £2500 a year; a Commissioner of
State Banks at £1500; a Controller of State
Enterprises at £1000; a Superintendent of
State Fish Shops; a new Chief Commis-
sioner of Stamps at £400; two Deputy Com-
missioners at £290 and £250; an editor of the
Education Gazette at £4lO, and a Deputy
Auditor-General at £GOO. War? What
war?
“Queenslander” sums up the local compli-
cation :
Things are only middling with the Ryan Govern-
ment these days. The Fihelly incident didn’t do it
a bit of good, and it was all because Fihelly was
too pig-headed to own that he had made a bloomer.
He just brazened things, although Macartney held out
the olive-branch, hinting that even with a mild with-
drawal the Opposition would declare everything
forgiven, if not forgotten. With something that
looked like bravado, Fihelly aggravated his original
offence, and the Government has reaped a crop of
odium in consequence. Recent caucus meetings have
provided opportunities for Fihelly’s enemies in the
party—and lie lias quite a few —to attack him with
considerable effect.
Then Ryan and his colleagues took up an absurd
attitude towards conscription. It. would have been
ordinary tactics for the Premier to have deputed
three or four members of the party, together with one
Minister, to get out and about, and talk “Yes i”
Then, whatever happened, Ryan could have said,
“Well, we never made it a party question!” There
were several men ready to talk “Yes!” including
Hunter (Lands), Hardaere (Education) and Hamilton
(Mines), and probably half a dozen members like
John May (Flinders) and Larcombe (Keppel). It
is common knowledge that Ryan rushed back from
the South just in time to head off Hunter and
personally persuade him not to go against the edict
of the caucus. So the whole 46 members of the
party, headed by the Premier, unnecessarily rushed
down the steep place like the Biblical swine, and
now they are extremely sorry for themselves.
The Opposition is “layin’ low an’ sayin’ nufHn’.”
The Leg. Council, which never loved the Government,
is meditating vicious things. Then the new budget
of Theodore (Treasurer) shows no hint of economy,
and the taxpayers resent this bitterly. To further
complicate matters, the Government has incurred the
hostility of the Daily Mail, which is now perhaps [
the most influential journal in the State. Thus, one
way and another, there is a very fair chance of a
political- crisis in the offing. When it comes, Ryan
is going to London as Agent-General, leaving Hunter
and Theodore to struggle for the leadership—with
tlie odds on Theodore.
Fifty years ago the Port Denison Times,
commenting on the arrival of the Percy with
50 Kanakas for the beche de-mer trade: —
It is the first step towards the introduction of a
most valuable branch of trade. No difficulty has
been found in getting natives on an 18 months’
engagement, and if the men are well treated and
faithfully returned to their chiefs within the stipu-
lated time we do not suppose there will be any
difficulty in the future.
Most people believe the Kanaka first came
to Queensland to grow sugar or cotton. But
he didn’t. Beche-de-mer and Bobby Towns’s
boiling-down establishment first attracted
Tommy Tanna to Queensland.
Theodore’s financial statement is a glitter-
ing sample of frenzied finance. Revenue in-
creased by half a million in the 12 months;
but that merely provided an excuse to scat-
ter public funds half as hard again. Expen-
diture for 1914-15 averaged £1 Bs. 2d. per
head ; in 1915-16 it leaped to £2 2s. 9d. Loan
spendings amounted to £3,389,214; trust
ditto, £1,555,000; and revenue expenditure,
£7.683,319 —a total of over 124 millions
fox a population of 670,000, This current
year Theodore anticipates spending a lot
more, and to meet a deficit of £158,000 pro-
poses increased income tax and super tax.
Such a thing as economy is not thought of.
“Itan”: Re Canning Downs (B.
12/10/T6). Pat Leslie bought the first
allotment of the great estate in the first
Warwick subdivision. The lodge gates were
the most pretentious on any squattage in
Queensland. They were afterwards removed
to their present site in Oxenham-street,
Warwick. Furness, the builder, died lately
after stepping into his second century. In

the place was the hub of the Downs. It was
there that explorer Gregory organised his
last expedition to look for the lost Leich-
hardt. Amongst the old hands of the station
was Jack Howe, father of the unbeaten
champion hand-shearer; he came to the dis-
trict as the clown of Ashton’s circus. For
years he was the town-crier at Warwick.
“The Reefer”: Torres Strait islanders
employed on pearling luggers put in a lot of
their spare time spinning tops. These toys
are of solid stone, up to eight inches in
diameter, and saucer shaped. They have a
hardwood “peg” through the centre, project-
ing a couple of inches below and about 12
above. For preference they are spun on a
crockery plate by means of a cord spirally-
wound around the top part of the spindle.
Fifteen minutes is a fair spin.
Muttaburra, the little township on the
Landsbrough River, has a unique record.
When the recruiting-officer called to con-
script for home defence he found there was
not a single eligible man on the premises.
The young women of the town were the
recruiting agents; Muttaburra holds three
dances every week and the maidens refused
to dance with any man of military age who
had neglected to volunteer. For a time
there were a few wallflowers; then they
gradually drifted out to the big corroboree. *

QUEENSLAND.
ZORA CROSS.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, November 4. 1916,
My Dear Thargominoaii, —
The wife of the president of our Deg.
Council (Arthur Morgan), who represented
Charity in the recent Queens carnival toi
the benefit of the Residential Club tor
Returned Soldiers, made as a compli-
ment to her committee on Thursday after-
noon. In retaliation, a keepsake of the
good results of the campaign was passed to
the dame.
While we’re on the subject of housing our
Billjims incapacitated from the Front I
must tell you that Governor Goold-Adams
is going to take a first-hand interest himself
in this move. While he was drawing the
marbles that decided the Patriotic Art
Union on Tuesday at the Royal he men-
tioned that he would at an early date send
round the hat. I don't know a hat in
Bananaland that has a better chance of
being burst at the seams with the result.
Polite naggings still make unpleasant the
environment of the Residential Club, and
only old Mother Shipton knows whether
homing Billzacs will have to first become
members of the R.S.A. before the house will
be open to them. If there’s a clique trying
to corner this place, which is being pro-
vided by public subscription for the boys
who have crawled out of the trenches to
limp home, it’s time the axe was put on
the grindstone.
Brisbane’s old friend manager C. F.
King is in the procession of those doing
their bit. He’s helping along the Repatria-
tion Fund at the Theatre Royal. All he
rakes in above the expenses of running the
show goes to the good cause. Now, how
about it for one evening this week?
At last, after being in the thick of the
fight for over two years, the Ninth Battalion
has a Comforts Fund of its own. Mrs.
Cam Robertson, whose husband is the popu-
lar O.C. of the Battalion, is at the wheel,
and she hopes to steer oversea the first lot
of cash in time for the boys to shake the
welkin up at the year-end.
Arthur Jones, a young Australian avia-
tor, will shortly leave for where he can do
the most damage with some section of the
Flying Corps.
Earl Jenkinson, son of our ex-Mayor, who
left with the first batch of Queenslanders
and afterwards got a commission in
the R.F.A., has commended himself to an
English girl. As a matter of fact, she has
agreed to accept a ring from him, and, when
the war is over, to face the cannibals that
make night hideous on the tracks of the
overlanding bunyip.
Jack Lindsay, the eldest son of artist
Norman Lindsay, has just passed (top of
the list) an exam, which gives him an
extension of three years at the Grammar.
Young .Tack’s hobby is turning Greek verse
into Latin.
Mrs. Dick, superintendent of the telephone
exchange, has left us. The other day the
staff said a regretful good-bye to her on the
eve of her departure for South Africa via
Sydney and Melbourne. The late W. 11.
Dick, her husband, was a well-known
journalist, and there is a son who has the
same precarious and fascinating hobby.
Jean Laerte and his wife, two accom-
plished musicians, are gladdening Empire
audiences this week. The lady, profession-
ally known as Madame Alverna, is a Maori-
lander who was singing in grand opera in
Europe when the Kaiser put his army into
marching boots. Jean Laerte, her husband,
made his mark long since as a violinist and
pianist.
The charm of the Orchestral Society’s
concert at the Exhibition Hall on Tuesday
was Marjorie Atkinson’s voice. She is a
Brisbane girl with a gilt-edged future unless
she loses her contralto trill en route.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Having set up butchers’ simps, the Govern-
ment has now spent a further quarter of a
million in buying stations to keep them sup-
plied with beef. The latest purchases have
been made from Burns and Johnston. Ltd.,
and consist of a chain of cattle-runs stretch
iug up from Townsville to the Gulf. The
Burns in the case is the head of the big ship-
ping firm. Having set up the butchers’ shops
and bought the cattle stations, some new
excuse will soon have to be found why beef
isn’t sold for 2-ld. per lb. Probably it will
be discovered that the shipping cos. are the
cause of the trouble ; and then a new loan
will be raised to buy out a shipping co. or
two. And on present appearances the ship-
ping cos. won’t mind. Anyway, it is quite
safe to say the half-dozen shareholders in
Burns and Johnston, Ltd., are not weeping.
The champion weird lie of the Referendum
campaign (awarded blue ribbon and three
specials) referred to the good old busting of
the marriage- tie. This frightful fabrication,
which some pumpkin-headed electors did
actually believe, was that all the men
between 21 and 35 who'got married between
proclamation and polling-day did so ‘‘ille-
gally,” and their children would be illegiti-
mate. Wilhelm’s most experienced mutila-
tors couldn’t have treated the truth with
greater savagery.
“Tracker”: In theory there is nothing to
be said for a House of Fat. But on the
facts do the crimes of any Leg. Council make
it such a public nuisance and peril as the
people are who promise to abolish the Coun-
cils and neglect to do it? Lower Houses in
Australia have absolute command of one
thing—the cash. They have undisputed
authority over taxation and expenditure.
Very well. How many people are there
who could make out even a plausible case
in favor of concentrating on the abolition of
the Council instead of upon the question
of protecting the people’s pockets from being
rilled? Anyhow, if there is more to be
said against Second Chambers than in favor
of putting a halter on the Chambers that
authorise muddle and .waste and debt and
bloat, somebody ought to say it. At the
worst Dodder is an old mule. At the best
the other crowd are locusts, caterpillars,
rabbits, sparrows and codlin moth.

Explaining “Feminine Charm”
By MILLICENT BROWN.
Illustrated by PENRHYN STANLAWS.
1 NOTICED a curious thing recently in
a railway train. A nicely-dressed
woman entered, and took a seat beside
me. I saw that everyone was looking at
her —staring, in fact. But
not offensively, you under-
stand. I caught my-
self doing the same
thing. It was

“Would you mind telling

your complexion so dazzlingly pure? You
won’t think me impertinent, but you seem
to be over thirty, aren’t you? And yet you
haven’t a line in your face, and your cheeks

Every woman has a beauti-

my face firm and free from wrinkles, I
merely indulge in a sparkling face bath two
or three times a week, which I prepare by
dissolving a little stymol (obtained at the
chemist’s) in a bowl of warm water. This
also keeps away those unpleasant little
blackheads, and prevents ‘shine.’ ”

“If we abolish drink we will abolish the
desire for drink,” says an eminent Melbourne
apostle. Yes, and to cure appetite it is only
necessary to abolish bread.
Bethmann-Hollweg, Imperial German
Chancellor, is over Oft. sin. tall. Very awk-
ward when he wants to see where the mark
has fallen to.
Melbourne University has given 400 stu-
dents to the war. There are 000 fewer male
students now than there were early in 1914.
Etienne (Etty) Livingstone de Mestre,
winner of the first two Melbourne Cups,
who died at Garryowen, Moss Vale
(N.S.W.), recently, was a Sydney native,
son of Prosper de Mestre, an American
merchant, who had settled here. A special
Act of Council was passed for his naturali-
sation. He had a fine estate known as
Terara, near Shoalhaven, where the son Etty
trained his‘race-horses. By the way, Archer,
with whom De Mestre won the Melbourne
Cups, was only a “rented” horse.
Colonel C. M. Gibbon, Chief of the M.L.
General Staff, and Lieut.-Colonel C. R.
Macdonald, Chief Infantry Instructor, are
the officers who are chiefly responsible for
the rapid working up of the raw material
tliat makes armies on the other side of the
Tasman. The two enthusiasts are con-
stantly on the move. Colonel Gibbon flits
about from camp to camp in a runabout.
He is a tall man when he stands up straight
and a long one when he lies down. Also, he
has a compelling eye and no use for social
frill. He is inclined to be impatient of
criticism, but otherwise allows nothing to
disturb his plans. The troops in the Maori-
land camps are practically all infantry now,
so Macdonald’s job is a big one. He is a
slight, polite Englishman, very cool, and a
good judge of men. When one draft of
2000 threatened to make trouble it was
Macdonald who went and talked to them,
and knew so well what to say that there
was no riot. Both are Imperial Staff Offi-
cers with records of active service.
While the shores of Westernport are
studded with coal-bearing areas, which the
Vic. Government is keeping in reserve, the
Railways, for which the State coal-mine at
Wonthaggi is being worked, afe importing
large quantities of fuel from Lithgow
(N.S.W.). The Wonthaggi worker should
be able to see in this development a bright,
red warning against the foolishness of strik-
ing whenever the mood is upon him. IJis
lot will be a poor one if the Vic. State’s
own mine comes to be regarded merely as a
temporary convenience.
“Bobstay” : The old Cavanba has gone to
Davy Jones. She traded for many years on
the north coast of N. S. Wales, and was
once considered a skittish young thing with
a taste in heels. Last year she was sold to
“Eastern buyers,” but apparently her White
Australian spirit didn’t relish working for
the Asiatic, and she piled herself up almost
on her first voyage.
“Chudah”: The Sydney Zionist Society
has just issued a pamphlet on “Herzl
Forest,” emanating from the head office of
the Jewish National Fund. The handful of
print relates to a great and ambitious work
—the reafforestation of Palestine, denuded
bv ages of neglect from its antique luxuri-
ance. Herzl, who was an eminent Zionist,
died in 1904. He had started an Olive Tree
Fund, now known, as the Herzl Forest Fund,
"or giving bare old Palestine olives, and the
eucalypts from Australia, as well as all the
suitable fruit trees. The eucalypt is especi-
ally admired by the Arabs, who call it “the
Jewish tree.” Put Norman Lindsay’s Jew-
ish-looking bear into one and you have a
complete pawnshop.
“Purukamu”: Afforestation 'experts in
M.L. are urging the Government to get to
work at planting Australian timbers, especi-
ally in the heart of the North Island, as a
source of future supply when the native
bush has been chopped and burned out.
Native timbers are to be planted, too. but
the best of them grow so slowly that gen-
erations will pass before they are fit for the
sawmill. The Australian and Tasmanian
hardwoods, red-gum and half a dozen others,
do so well in Maoriland that whole forests
of them could be available in 50 years or
thereabouts. It is probable, too, that the
mosquito plague in the swampy districts of
the Bay of Plenty, the Piako, the Northern
Wairoa and the King Country could be
battled with effectively by the liberal plant-
ing of eucalypts. Most farmers in Loan-
land go in for the cultivation of blue-gums,
and the Government might try planting them
on a big scale on newly-opened Crown lands,
such as the Hauraki Plains, in the Piako.
where the skeeter is almost unbearable. I
know of one Waikato farm where the sow-
ing of a wide patch alongside the homestead
with blue-gum and red-gum seed produced in
a few years a grove that strafed every mos-
quito in the vicinity.
“Dead Finish”: Re “Paddymelon’s” idea
for utilising the principle of the vacuum-
cleaner for choke damp, etc., in mines (B.
12/10/T6). Something over 29 years ago
one Higgins, well known in mining circles
about Gundagai and Mudgee (N.S.W.), ex-
perimented with an idea for ridding shafts
of foul air. Using a small boiler,, he com-
pletely closed up the bottom damper, and
fitted a three-inch pipe into it, running this
pipe down to the bottoiri of the shaft. The
furnace was thus compelled to take its sup-
ply of air from the bottom of the shaft, and
the draught created was so great that it not
only cleared the atmosphere, but took any
stray papers, etc., that came handy. It
was a simple and inexpensive idea: but it
was Australian, and perhaps for that reason
was never gone on with.

Extremely long and green;

These grasses purr and bow:

“Wool Buyer”: When in London Prime
Minister Hughes purchased some 15
steamers, and there was great jubilation in
certain circles at the inauguration of a line
of State steamers to check the gluttony of
the Combine, or, as it is termed, the Oversea
Conference (by any other name ’twould
smell as sweet). Some relief was antici-
pated by shippers, if not at once then in the
not distant future, but to the astonishment
of exporters these steamers have been turned
over to the agency of members of the Con-
ference, and I’d admire to know the reason
thereof. One or two of the steamers are
already announced as coming to Australia
in ballast! Incidentally rates of freight by
“conference” steamers to London from Aus-
tralia have been advanced on wool to 2fd.
per lb., which is equal to £26 per ton, as
against £6 per ton for wheat which the
Government steamers are to carry. Will
someone explain what nigger is in this wood-
pile ?

The country people in Victoria are coming

want to make a clean sweep of six of the
taxing machines. A conference of all the
country bodies in Victoria will presently
consider whether a system of district coun-
cils, with power to legislate for local require-
ments, but with all national matters like
railways and harbor control transferred to
the Federal Parliament, would not fill the
bill. Councillor Curnow is the leader of the
revolt.

The very practical W. A. Hargreaves,
director of the S. Aus. Chemical Research
Department, has been considering Australia’s
paper-making possibilities, and finally plumps
for wheat straw as the chief available
material —for some years to come, anyhow.
Rags, waste paper, marram grass, etc., might
also be used, but there is not enough of this
stuff to go far, and wood pulp is out of the
question. But within a hundred miles of
Port Adelaide S. Aus. produces some half a
million tons of straw every year, and that
would be food enough for several mills.

“Truthful James” In the course of a
varied experience I’ve had the following
methods of mine “salting” tried on me:—
Pumping gold chloride by means of a hypo-
dermic syringe into the bags containing the
samples; dropping small portions of clay
impregnated with gold-dust into the vessel
during sampling operations; knocking the
ashes out of a pipe containing gold-dust into
the sample; dusting galena and copper
samples with very fine filings from a silver
or copper coin; charging an ordinary cart-
ridge with gold, and firing into the rocks;
and working gold-dust into the gelignite,
carefully replacing the wrapper. In the
last method you are asked to select a spot to
bore a hole and when it is fired you dream
of millions. But the easiest way sometimes
is to pump in whisky and get the loan of
the sampler’s keys while he is asleep.
THE STREET ARTIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He leaned, with all his wares unsold, against the city
wall,
Weary and grey, the architect of this strange gallery
Of seascapes and of landscapes that were not of earth
at all,
A parody of forests and a skit upon the sea.
Some quickness with the pencil and some ardor for
the brush
Perhaps began his downfall and his hope of a career ;
And I thought of brown bees drumming in an almond-
scented hush,
And / breathed a whiff of woodland —though he
reeked of last night’s beer.
And I thought of tumbling oceans and of pale mists,
delicate,
And of dewy plains at dawning and of black soil
freshly ploughed,
And i wondered why his hand must knock, unheeded,
on the gate
Of the visionings of hillsides and the marvel of a
cloud;
The tan sand in a breaking wave, the curl of creamy
foam,
The glimmer of wet beaches and the moonshine on the
reeds,
A swaying of green seaweed where Pacific breakers
comb,
Or the long, slow, sunlit reaches where the lonely
heron feeds.
His sunsets were like beefsteak when it’s badly under-
done ;
In his penance sheets of moonlight, warm romance
went staggering, faint; ■
There was war, and there was rapine in the carnage
of his sun;
So I turned and gave him sixpence for the things he
couldn’t paint!

“Rexona for Mine
All the Time,”
Says DAISY JEROME.
Miss DAISY JEROME
(from a photo).
No actress lias ever had the Australian record
possessed by Miss Daisy Jerome. Originally
brought to Australia for the J. 0. Williamson revue
“Come Over Here” she afterwards remained here
in pantomime and vaudeville. For the three and a
half years she was in Australia she never received
less than £lOO a week. Iso other actress can boast
of having, like Miss Jerome, appeared in Sydney
again and again—always proving a terrific draw,
and in that way fully justifying the huge salary
received by her.
Miss Jerome, who keeps her glorious hair in
condition with Rexona Soap, joins our galaxy of
Rexona girls, with these words: —
“Dear Sirs, —»
“My audiences all know
the lines, ‘My hair may
be funny, but it is getting
me the money,’ and I hope
Rexona Soap gets you the
money, for it is Rexona
Soap for mine all the
time. It keeps my hair
silky and fluffy, as you
see it. I receive presents
of soap in every city, but
I buy Rexona Soap.
Surely this' speaks for
itself.
“Yours truly,
‘ (Sgd.) DAISY JEROME.”
The Rexona Remedies consist of Rexona, the Rapid Healer, and Rexona Skin and
Facial Soap, both universal favorites. The wonderful healing powers of Rexona have
made it a password in nearly every home in Australasia. Rexona Soap is the best
preservative for the skin and hair that is obtainable. Try for yourself and prove
our words. Rexona, 1/6 and 3/-. Rexona Soap, 1/- per table£.

Glad Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f HERE’S a tang in the air that lifts
I like wine,
And the heart of me as a lad’s is light;
I love the world, for the world is mine,
And little’s my trouble for wrong or right;
The grass is green and the sun is good,
And the glad blood stirs to my careless mood.
Good Christian folk in the chapel by
Are whining their sins to an organ drawl;
Stretched at my ease on the grass I lie,
Watching the sparrows in nuptial brawl,
And the scudding clouds and the gulls that
dip
And flutter and plane in the wake of a ship.
Far over the harbor the city seems
No city at all, but a wondrous maid,
On whose fair body the sunlight streams
In wafts and dapples of light and shade ;
Tt wouldn’t surprise me the least, were she
To rise and dabble her toes in the sea.
There’s joy in love and there’s ease in song,
But each at whiles is inclined to cloy ;
God knows I wouldn’t do either wrong,
But better than both is the heart of a boy;
The rush of gladness robust and rude—
I’m old, but I tell you it’s mighty good!
Let the wise portend and the grave discuss,
The shriving of souls we can well let be;
Myself—it’s a murrain on all their fuss—
To live and be glad is enough for me,
With fruit and wine and a book of rhyme
And a lass, when I want her, to pass the
time.
For the warmth of the sun, for the blue of
the sky,
For the slap of the waves as they lip the
shore,
For the cool of the breeze as it idles by,
My heart gives thanks and I ask no more ;
With form and color and sound and scent,
0 Mother Earth, I am well content!
JIAORILAND.
BERNARD INGLEBY.
About Two Blackfellows, a Dog
and a Gin.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THAT is the order in which H.R.11.
Binghi would place them.
A mile out of Dingo Flat, in January,
1899, was located a blacks’ camp numbering
about one hundred and twenty souls, men
women and children; or, if we allow the
possession of souls to dogs, say two hundred.
They were of the Kurnalpi tribe, and Larry
was their king (goolaman). The chief out-
ward sign of Larry’s kingship appeared in
the fact that he kept a harem, its occupants
being three: Handsome Trilby, Ruby of the
regal carriage and (generally) sore eyes,
and Lily with the kind heart and gentle
ways.
You could not walk along the main (and
only) street of Dingo Flat at any hour of
the day without encountering some of these
harmless, unnecessary people. The gins
came first, between six and seven in the
morning, to do the rounds of the kitchens.
The males, as a rule, did not show up before
nine o’clock, and were, of course, accom-
panied by the dogs. All, including the
mongrels, lived on the townspeople. It
was only on important occasions, such as
the approach of a corroboree, that they
would revert to their natural habits and
hunt their tucker in the surrounding bush.
Then the males would put in a day among
the low hills lying between the town and
Lake Carey, armed with spears and nullahs
and their inherited and acquired patience
and endurance and bushcraft, and inevitably
they would return to camp that night with
two or more kangaroos. Yet white men
would go into the same country, possessed
of expensive, up-to-date firearms, only to
come back empty-handed.
It was 10 o’clock of a Sunday morning
and the shade temperature was already over
the century. A dazzling, burning, still heat.
Our humpy, at the end of the street nearest
the blacks’ camp, was of corrugated iron,
unlined, and it was my turn to clean it out.
From the front across a sea of dingy-brown
nmlga, broken here and there by the beauti-
ful green of a currajong, towards the low
ranges that separated us from dry Lake
Carey, the air was visible and danced. Both
doors were open and I had arrived at my
labors in a line between the two, when I
became aware of some object momentarily
obscuring the light. I glanced up in time
for a repetition, and found the obstruction
was caused by the flitting of a brown note
of interrogation. I stepped to the door. The
whole length of the street was punctuated
with these brown queries, all moving in the
one direction. They represented gins who,
for some cause that admitted of no delay,
were hastening back to camp. Presently
one drew level. It was Ruby of the king’s
harem. Only she was not brown. Most of
the gins when paying us a visit came clad
in a long singlet reaching to mid-thigh, or
a nondescript garment, obtained from a
white sister, falling to the knee. These,
whatever the original tint, from much con-
tact with the earth acquired eventually a
brown shade. Also the complexion of the
gin is nearer bronze than black. Hence at
a little distance, with her somewhat
shadowy build, the female native of this part
of Westralia appears as something in the
nature of a brown streak when walking, and
a note of interrogation of a like tint when
running. Ruby, however, for some unex-
plained reason, always appeared in public
chastely clad in a guernsey of South Mel-
bourne red and white.
“What’s the row. Ruby?” I called. (One
can be familiar with the king’s harem when
one has to help feed it.)
“Big fella fight longa camp”; and she
panted on.
I retired hastily, seized the broom and
wished through my cleaning. It did not
take long, but when I came out again the
place was clear of blacks. Several of the
white population had, however, appeared
on the street; and as I started for the battle-
field I knew that within a quarter of an
hour there would not be a male over the
age of twelve left in Dingo Flat, barring
the three publicans. These heroes, with a
sublime indifference as to who was fighting
and what the row was about, would remain
in the coolness of their bars, polishing their
glasses in an atmosphere of cigar-smoke,
and (as time wore on) cocking their ears
for sounds of the return of a hot and thirsty
multitude. They would remain there, I say,
at their posts, calm, cool, inflexible, with a
singlemindedness, a passive heroism that
would have put to shame a Roman sentinel.
The town had been under the spell of a vir-
tuous fit lately, much to the detriment of
the publicans’ takings. And it was just
such a happening as this was required to
start that curious phenomenon locally
known as a drink wave, which, once started,
might go on and on for a fortnight, a month,
six weeks —no one could say with any degree
of certainty how long. The only sure thing
about this strange disturbance was that,
before it finally subsided, ninety per cent,
of the adult male population of Dingo Flat
would have suffered partial or complete
immersion at one time or another. Indeed,
many, having recovered the first soaking,
would plunge in a second and even a third
time, before the Flat was hung out finally
to dry. Outsiders would be drawn in too.
One would come in from farther back on
business at the registrar’s office perhaps, or
to send a telegram, intending to return the
same day. After waiting the best part of
a week, his mate, knowing exactly what had
happened, would come to the rescue. And
he would rescue him, too, after twenty-four
hours of bullying and persuading and shep-
herding. But by that time it was the res-
cuer’s turn to be rescued. And so it would
go on until a common friend would take
both in hand, and, having kept a close watch
on their drinks overnight, would pack them
off first thing in the morning, each with a
still nip inside and a bottle of whisky out-
side to taper off with at camp.
When I had covered half the journey
there was a quick pattering of naked feet
behind me, and, looking back, I saw in my
wake little Hetty, a bright thirteen-year-
old. It was not necessary to slow down and
allow her to overtake me. Hetty had not
consumed the quantities of Dingo Flat
whisky that I had.
“Which ones fight?’’ I asked, as she came
up.
“Larry and William.”
This was a shock. Larry, the king, was
au. athletic man in the prime of life. Wil-
liam was old, bent, flat-chested, with rheumy
eyes and a chronic cough.
“What they fight about?”
“Larry hit William’s dog with nullah.”
That explained it. No blackfellow, how-
ever old and feeble, would stand that. And
now Letty, finding me too slow, had com-
menced to put daylight between us.
Then her business instincts got the better
of her excitement for a moment.
“Dibit tchikipen, Yarry,” she whined.
“Nothing plour, nothing tchugar, nothing tea.
Yungry pfella, this one.” And having got
what she wanted she basely left me, as is the
way of her sex, and I plodded on the rest of
the way alone.
Owing, however, to my living at the end of
the town nearest the blacks’ camp, I was the
first white man on the spot. But not by
much. There were little Harry Maguire and
long Bill Williamson, the two storekeepers,
coming together. And not far behind Jack
Martin, the blacksmith. And Wilkinson,
the registrar. And Woods, mining engineer.
Yes—and there was the old doctor, a little on
the big side and short of wind, but game.
And Jack Wilson, of the billiard-room, com-
monly called “Flash Jack.” Oh, they were
all there, except the three heroes already
mentioned.
The place chosen for the encounter might
have been laid out by nature with a special
regard to affairs of the kind. It was a rect-
angular clearing in the scrub two hundred
yards long by one hundred and fifty wide.
The principals were not yet on view, but the
other members of the tribe were scattered
about the clearing. The females were bunched
together in one corner. The males stood
about in groups at the farther end, quite
dissociated from the women, as became their
greater dignity and the importance of the
occasion. We whites, mere outsiders, re-
mained within the shelter of the timber.
“There they are,” someone ejaculated sud-
denly. And so they were. They had entered
the clear space from different points, and
were strutting about, talking to the others,
but neither displaying any knowledge of the
other’s proximity. They were naked, except
for their loin-cloths, and were streaked on
cheek, breast and thigh with white paint.
Each carried a single spear in the right hand
and a number in the left. A bundle of nullahs
was thrust through the loin-cloth. Larry
looked, in his warpaint, much as one would
have expected. But in William the change
was startling. Ilis chest had lost its flatness,
the body was held erect, all liis movements
were brisk, his eye. fiery. He seemed to have
sloughed fully twenty of his years, and he
1 ioked a dangerous opponent even for Larry.
While we were thinking these things the
men had taken their positions at either end
of the cleared space. Immediately (the
start being apparently by mutual consent)
each began walking quickly towards the
opposite end. They moved in parallel lines,
and their starting points were such that at
the first crossing there would be about fifty
yards between them. As they walked, each
kept his eyes fixed straight ahead and jab-
bered away incessantly. So they went up
and down, their lines of march steadily
approaching one another. Thus at each cross-
ing the distance between them was lessened.
Presently, as they crossed, one stopped, faced
his opponent with left foot forward and spear
raised threateningly; at the same time his
speech increased in rapidity and volume until
it became a rushing torrent. We thought the
real business was about to commence. But
the other walked on quite unconcerned, his
gaze fixed on the horizon and all his mind on
his own particular prayer. Then the threat-
ener lowered his weapon, resumed his march
and dropped his voice to its original mono-
tone. The psychological moment had not
arrived. This performance was gone through
many times, the space between the combatants
(Continued on next page.)


HEALTHY KIDNEYS KEEP THE
The kidneys are the blood-filters of
the body, and when they are clogged
they keep back the liquid waste and
impurities from the blood, so that the
body fills with water. This is called
dropsy, and it is a very dangerous
disease.
Your danger begins when there are
sharp pains in the back, puffy swell-
ings beneath the eyes or in the ankles,
sick headaches, nervousness and flutter-
ing heart.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are
a special kidney medicine —they have
one set purpose—to relieve, tone up
and strengthen the kidneys, and they
do not affect the bowels at all. This
kidney medicine —the genuine Doan’s
—dissolves the crystallised uric acid
which clogs the kidneys, bladder and
connecting passages, and in this way
removes and cures the cause of dropsy,
diabetes, Bright’s disease, stone,
cystitis (inflammation of the bladder)
and urinary disorders. It is because
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cure
the CAUSE of disease that cures are

Cured to Stay Cured.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
| FROM ALEXANDRIA."!
Mrs. A. Weir, 168 Botany Road, Alexandria,
Sydney, says: “In common with many others, I can
give Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills a first-class recom-
mendation as a cure for backache and kidney disorder,
these pills having cured me of a bad attack some
months ago. Before I took this remedy I suffered
terribly, my back being so stiff and painful that I could
hardly get about; in fact, I have been so bad that I
have had to lay up, being almost crippled with the
awful pain. My ankles and legs swelled considerably,
and were sore to the touch, and I was also subject to
dizzy attacks. I could not get proper rest at night,
and, in consequence, always felt dull and tired and
had no energy. However, a course of Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills soon put an end to my health
troubles, and I have been grand ever since.”
Two years later Mrs. Weir confirms the above.
“I am still well, and have had no return of my old
complaint since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cui’ed
me over two years ago.”
| FRoM PARRAMAT laT~|
Mr. Walter Niddrie, Cowper Street, Harris Park,
Parramatta, says: “I suffered terribly with my kid-
neys. The worst symptoms were backache and rheu-
matism. Sometimes I would be doubled up with the
pain and unable to do my work. Hearing Doan's
Backache Kidney Pills very highly spoken of as a cure
for all ills arising from disordered kidneys, I decided
to try them, so got some at once. They acted splen-
didly, a few bottles banishing the backache and rheu-
matism entirely, and giving me complete relief from
pain. Previous to taking the pills I would often sit
down, and it would be fully ten minutes before I could
get up again to a standing position. I was unable to
stoop to lace my boots in the morning, and my wife
would do it for me. I am quite free of backache and
rheumatism now, and I consider that without Doan s
Backache Kidney Pills I would have had to give up my
billet.”
Seventeen years later Mr. Niddrie, says: “I have
been free of backache and rheumatism since Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills cured me seventeen years ago.
I never suffer with my kidneys now, and am in
splendid health.”

The Sins of the Parents.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I SEE by the paper that Sissy Mcßride
is married. A real swell affair it must
have been, too, for the people that Sis
was born amongst don’t advertise their lines
in the newspaper.
The man that’s got Sissy has drawn a
prize all right—that is, if she is the girl
she was when she lived in the Cut a few
years back.
To say the least, she was a wayward girl.
Everyone predicted a bad end for her, and
a bad end in the Cut is a sight worse than
it sounds. Her mother was a widow-woman
and Sissy her only child, which, to most
people, made matters seem worse, for a
widow’s only one is expected to be a sort of
paragon. But I sometimes used to think:
“God help widow Mcßride if she had a num-
ber like Sissy!”
I saw Sissy ripen from a dirty-faced brat
into a daisy-tongued, untidy girl, and I never
heard anyone say a good word for her. But
the boys liked her : she was one of them-
selves, with as much conscience and morals
—or maybe less.
It may surprise you to hear morals men-
tioned in connection with the Cut, but people
down that way are reallv a great deal
stricter about such things than they are
in Potts Point and the like. Up there the girl
that makes a false step is sent quietly away
till the scandal blows over; but down in the
Cut she must face it out—and it takes a lot
of facing
As a girl Sissy was so wild and “unlady-
like” that the women would not let her asso-
date with their daughters. They sympa-
tlnsed with her widowed mother, but their
private opinion was that the blame rested
with her, as she was too weak-willed to deal
wit h the delinquent as they would have
done
Mrs. Mcßride was a good-looking woman,
listless and complaining, but so genteel that
she was rather looked up to in Cut society,
in spite of her daughter. The daughter had
better looks than her mother and a firmer
will, and I often thought that with a surer
hand to guide her Sissy would have turned
out a modest, well-behaved lass.
When Sissy was past sixteen her mother
began to get poorly, and told her neighbors
she’d have to go away for a changl, but
seemed anxious about leaving the girl by
herself. Not long after, however, the widow
went, and Sissy was left to mind the cottage,
The neighbors became “conscientious
objectors,” and made several attempts to
get her into the Salvation Army Home - but
their efforts met with such language from
the accomplished young lady that at last
they left her alone and contented themselves
by prophesying unutterable evil,
Months went by ; Sissy was still alone,
but we seldom saw her, except at night,
when she would occasionally do a bit of
shopping at the corner grocery. Once, how-
ever, a visitor was seen leaving the cottage
very late, and tongues wagged more
fiercely than ever. It was Ginger Maloney
wbo p£ " d so ate a visit, or rather, whom
people suspected of making a very late exit;
and knowing his propensity for the ladies,
P° or Sissy’s character was gone like thistle-
down before the wind. No one dared tell
Maloney’s wife,_ however; she would have
stripped the hair from his head till he had
n °t enough left to give color to his name.
The next ltem . thls drama w as Sissy’s
disappearance. A few days after Maloney’s
visit the cottage was found shut up and she
had flown in the night. If any evidence were
needed to support the suspicions concerning
her morals —or lack of them —the chain was
now complete.
When Sis had been gone about two
months Mrs. Mcßride returned to the Cut
and was met with nods of mournful sym-
pathy and inquiries as to the whereabouts of
her daughter. But the widow had nothing
to say on this subject, and would just bury
her face in her hands and weep copiously at
the mention of Sissy’s name. They were all
very sorry for Mrs. Mcßride, but no amount
of sympathy could get her to talk about her
trouble. She seemed in worse health than
before, and her face was the same interest-
ing yellow that tints the washing that hangs
out in the Cut.
One morning, about nine o’clock, the door
of Widow Mcßride’s cottage opened, and
out came Sissy, carrying a baby in her arms.
She marched across the road to the corner
grocery, taking no notice whatever of the
gasps of astonishment and loud comments
that greeted her appearance as she passed
the groups around each doorway, and
stepped among the children in the gutter.
Into the grocery she went and demanded
half a pound of butter. Mrs. Smith could
not serve her for surprise and just indigna-
tion at her brazen conduct.
“Whose baby have you there?” demanded
Mrs. Smith, feeling that something must be
said, but too flustered to investigate the
matter with more diplomacy.
“Whose do you think?” asked Sissy, put-
ting her face over the counter and bringing
it close to Mrs. Smith’s.
“Where did it come from?” said Mrs.
Smith, breathlessly.
“Grew in a cabbage, of course—didn’t you
know ?”
Mrs. Smith rushed over the way to report
to the other women, who were standing in
paralysed astonishment at the sudden re-
appearance and brazen conduct of the hussy.
I couldn’t attempt to describe to you what
it was like in the Cut after that. Poor Mrs.
Mcßride never showed her face outside the
door, and Sissy’s conduct was so outrageous,
her impudence so appalling, that the women
ceased to have any sympathy for Mrs.
Mcßride, and abused her instead.
To make matters worse, the baby had a
mop of thick red curls, and they were so
like Ginger Maloney’s that it was said his
wife intended to get a divorce. But they
don’t get divorces in the Cut; they throw
things around instead. Poor Ginger took to
sleeping in the coal-shed, and was never seen
without a black eye or a scratched face. He
took it all quietly, however, and his denials
of the parentage of Sissy’s baby met with
derision—even among some of the more
broadminded ones who grant that “a man is
a man, and a ginger man one and a half.”
You couldn’t help admiring Sissy, in a
sneaking sort of way. Of course, " no one
would be seen talking to her, but occasion-
ally, when no one was looking, the boys
would press a lolly into the kiddie’s hand
and pass the time of day with his unre-
pentant mother. You couldn’t put Sissy out
of countenance—not if you tried. The women
couldn’t do it, and God knows they did all
they knew. If she saw a group of them
gossiping together she would walk right up
and chip into the conversation, following
them as they walked away. They were pro-
perly horrified, those women, and they put
“the Army” on to her. But she was a
match for the lassies, and they soon let her
alone. They even had the police out nosing
around, but it turned out Sis was older than
they thought.
She made a good mother, for I never saw
her without the baby, nor did I ever see her
without a cheerful grin on her face and a
bevy of stray dogs as bodyguard. She’d
give you a smile like the midday sun and
say, in her cheeky way, “Don’t take any
notice of me —your wife’s looking.”
Just how things would have ended it is
hard to tell, but I’m sure those women in the
Cut would have played her some nasty trick
if the Mcßrides’ next-door neighbor, Mrs.
Jones, had not been of a very inquisitive
nature and given to reading novelettes. She
got an idea that because she had seen
nothing of Mrs. Mcßride for a week, Sissy
must have “done her in” and buried the
body under the hearthstone. She waited
till she saw Sis go across the road on a
message, and then ran in the Mcßrides’ back
gate and peeped through the kitchen window.
There she saw Mrs. Mcßride seated before
the fire giving the red-haired baby a drink
from Nature’s bottle, and on the other side
of the hearth sat Ginger Maloney, nursing
the usual black eye—the picture of dejectiou.
Mrs. Jones and her discovery spread over
the Cut quicker than measles.
The Mcßrides’ place was empty next day.
And, strange to say, at the same time Mrs.
Maloney became a grass widow.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BUT little did I ask of Life:
To live awhile,
A brief day, when its joys w T ere rife,
And all its pleasures wore a smile.
But little did I ask of Love:
One girl supreme
O’er all who might a light heart move,
And death before we-lost our dream.
But little did I ask of Her:
With heart of fire,
To live, and die, each pulse astir,
Ere we exhausted hot desire.
Yet the high passion of our love
Has lost its heat,
And, though our pulses calmer move,
We hold our love and find it sweet.
And though the light romance that gave
To love its light
Is vanished, in my heart I save
A hundred thoughts that make it bright.
And Life, remaining past the scope
Of hoped-for years,
Shows still a treasury of hope,
Small joys, and tender thoughts, and tears.
