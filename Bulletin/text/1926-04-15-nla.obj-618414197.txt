In Defence of Bowdler
The Red Page
It is to be presumed that when Thomas
Bowdler produced his .Shakspeare for the
home he hoped for some small measure of
fame as the reward of his efforts and good
intentions. He has received it, after a
fashion, but to have bequeathed his name as
a more or less opprobrious epithet is rather
less than his deserts. Our grandfathers, at
least, acknowledged a debt of thanks to him,
and though moderns, who know nothing of
him but the name, are content to use him
as a verb, I, too, must record gratitude to
him for my early introduction to Shak-
speare ; at least, for inspiring my first curi-
osity concerning him.
Even now the first impression conjured up
by the name of the great Elizabethan is one
of fat and heavy volumes, of horsehair chairs,
antimacassars, oleographs and a sort of
musty silence peculiar to the Sabbath; of
my great-aunt Laura’s “parlor,” a shrine
that housed sacred things not to be touched
without special permission. There was the
w r axen fruit, seductively withdrawn beneath
domes of crystal; the marble clock with the
bronze lady atop, and flanked on either end
of the mantelpiece by equally ebon and gilt
vases, hung all round with tinkling pris-
matic lustres; and there were the even more
fascinating books which, provided he be-
haved, a small boy with clean fingers might
be permitted gingerly to inspect on Sundays.
The family photograph album, which occu-
pied the centre of the little round table' in
the middle of the room, contained too much
of actuality to interest a small boy, but it
was not so with the “Pilgrim’s Progress,”
with . Apollyon straddling right across the
way in three colors, nor with the ponderous
“Life of Christ,” from which, pictorially, I
gained my first glimpse of ancient Rome,
nor yet with “Dr. Bowdler’s Illustrated
Shakspeare.”
It is like a'tinkling chime of broken melody
from sonic old, rusted music-box to recall
that faded room. Aunt Laura has gone the
way of all flesh these many years, her house-
hold gods long since dispersed and derided.
And yet a few vestiges survive. The marble
clock and the bronze lady are still extant,
and Bowdler is now mine.
So, . deviously, I have returned to my
apologia; and now, looking at the sedate
backs of “The Family Shakspeare,” it
occurs to me to wonder at the injustice of
time’s revenges. Why. because of his mild
deletions, should Thomas Bowdler become
a contemptuous epithet, and Colley Cibber,
when he is remembered at all, not be remem-
bered, for his amazing mutilations of Shaks-
peare’s drama? Garrick’s anachronisms in
acting we know of only by hearsay, but he,
too, has left sufficient evidence of his injudi-
cious fingering to earn him all the oppro-
brium that Bowdler’s name so undeservedly
carries.
For us, familiar with modern manners and
authors, it is, perhaps, not easy to appre-
ciate the early-Victorian attitude of mind in
its revulsion against the grossness of the
declining years of the eighteenth and the
first years of the nineteenth century; but,
with a natural wish to see Shakspeare’s re-
flex of his age in afl its aspects, we do not
have to admit ourselves prudes if we hold
the opinion that some of those aspects are
not for the uncritical mind of youth to dis-
cover in the course of family fireside reading,
and it is to be remembered that reading aloud
in the family circle was the custom of Rowd-
ier s day, and long after. If by means of
jazz and movies we have vastly improved our
methods of amusement we should reflect with
kindliness on the disabilities of the Vic-
torians.
Thomas Bowdler, physician, traveller, phil-
anthropist and man of letters, understood
his own age, at all events, and accurately
judged its needs when in 1818 he produced
his ‘ 1 amily Shakspeare,” for it went through
nine editions between that year and 1870
He won popularity for the plays at a time
when they were again in danger of being
forgotten, but against this merit it is
assumed that he weakened Shakspeare by
undue expurgation. Examining his text in
comparison with a facsimile of the First
I oho, all that can be discovered is about
twenty-four lines deleted from “Hamlet,” and
a number of non-essential lines verging on
the indecent (as once understood) removed
from “Measure for Measure.” The poetry
and dramatic situations have suffered not at
all. He has been referred to as a person
endowed with “a sense of smell for impro-
prieties never perhaps equalled in the domain
of letters,” and the assertion is so unwar-
ranted as to suggest that the writer had not
even glanced at “The Family Shakspeare,”
for wliat Bowdler essayed, and did, is told
on his. title-page: “The Family Shakspeare,
in which nothing is added to the original
text, but those words and expressions are
omitted which cannot with propriety be read
in a family.”
The only thing that may be charged against
Bowdler is that, in an age that regarded family
reading, as an amusement, he deprived the
entertainment of some of its spice of adven-
ture.. It is very evident that he expressed the
opinion of a wide public when he wrote
in liis preface: “I can hardly imagine a more
pleasing occupation for a winter’s evening
in the country, than for a father to read one
of Shakspeare’s plays to his family circle.
My object is to enable him to do so without
incurring the danger of falling unawares
among words and expressions which are of
such a nature as to raise a blush on the
cheeks of modesty or render it necessary for
the reader to pause and examine the sequel
before he proceeds further in the entertain-
ment of the evening.” If in these years we
feel no need to safeguard the blushing cheek
of youth, we may generously make allow-
ance for an age that did; and yet, even
though we can stomach a “comedy of man-
ners” that has sexual perverts and perver-
sions as its chief characters and theme, is
there to-day a manager with courage enough
to stage, say, “Measure for Measure” strictly
according to the original text?
No, Dr. Thomas Bowdler certainly was not
a prurient iconoclast, but so far from it flint
he overcame his perplexities with regard to
“Othello” only by leaving the play alone.
“The multitude of indecent expressions
which abound in the speeches of the inferior
characters” he could remove, he said, but he
could not edit a line concerning Othello him-
self without “altering his character and de-
stroying the tragedy” ; and for this reason he
departed from his original intention “rather
than materially injure a most valuable exer-
tion of the genius of Sliakspeare,” and
advised parents who considered this play to
be too full of strong mea.t for family reading
to “transfer it from the parlor to the cab-
inet.” The attitude of mind so indicated
may be considered prudish, but it is cer-
tainly not prurient.
The hand of Bowdler has touched very
lightly, in fact, on the most widely-read of
Shakspeare’s plays, and not nearly so dras-
tically as the hand of modern theatrical pro-
ducers, and this was recognised, along with
other merits of Bowdler as an editor of
Shakspeare, by one of the frankest and fore-
most literary men of the last of the Victorian
era, who, in the “naughty ’nineties,” wrote
that “no man ever did better service to
Shakspeare than the man who made it pos-
sible to put him into the hands of intelligent
and imaginative children. It may well be. ..
that no man has ever done him such good
service.” The appreciator was Algernon
Charles Swinburne, and if, in 1894, he could
so praise Bowdler, it may be possible for
us in this year 1926 to revise our ideas con-
cerning him. Not Bowdler, but time and
publie taste have been the most ruthless
eliminators of the broad Elizabethan jest—
supplying in exchange the snigger of in-
nuendo.
DICK HARRIS.
Composers and Shekels
As civilisation advances the right of the
artist to the fruits of his labor is being
slowly but surely recognised. Time was
when the profits from the sale of the works
of a Dickens or a Thackeray went regularly
into the pockets of the piratical American
publisher, thus defrauding these gifted artists
and their families of many thousands of
pounds of their or their forebears’ hard-
earned money. The ordinary. public, igno-
rant and thoughtless in the matter, was will-
ing to profit by this form of theft; but
happily at this time of the day there would
seem to be little need to try to arouse the
public conscience. The issue appears quite
simple to the plain man accustomed to pay
his 20 shillings to the pound and to avoid the
acquisition of stolen goods. An honest man
would no sooner possess a pirated copy of a
copyright book (if he can secure any other
kind) than he would a suit length “lifted’’
from a city emporium.
The case of the musician is one of peculiar
difficulty. These great tone-poets have ever
been at loggerheads with fortune. Their
work, being usually that of an innovator, lias
necessarily been “caviare to the general.”
One thinks, in this connection, of S. Cole-
ridge-Taylor, the genius that produced “Hia-
watha’s Wedding Feast” and its fellows.
This wonder-man, of mingled American
negro and European ancestry, was a child in
business. He had produced a unique master-
piece which at last found a publisher, who
made such a wonderful bargain that, though it
achieved vast popularity, Coleridge-Taylor
was left in poverty. The outcry of the musi-
cal public was such that the publisher found
it expedient to salve his conscience by a
gift of something like a hundred pounds.
What profits his firm made out of this noble
work, which actually broke new ground in
tone-poetry, was never, of course, divulged;
whether his conscience afterwards daneed an-
other saraband that caused him to disgorge
some more of Coleridge-Taylor’s inspiration-
sweated hard cash I do not know; let us
hope so for the sake of one’s esteem of poor
old human natqre. Otherwise there is still
Sunt in Lora Byron’s hit at John
urray: “Now Barabbas was a publisher.”
There is no need to labor the point
that the artist musician is frequently
at a disadvantage in making terms with the
keen business man. The interesting develop-
ment has now taken place that the musician
—'artistic and, alas, otherwise —has made
an ally of the keen business man.
The growth of the practice of listening-in
has had a good deal to do with this. Old
songs have suddenly thrown off the cerements
of the years and arisen like Lazarus from
the tomb. They have begun to earn profits,
and lavish ones at that, for their composers.
To secure these profits for their rightful
Owners has not, of course, been an easy
matter. The broadcasting companies have
not gone around with bags of pelf in their
hands beseeching the writers of the resur-
rected songs to come forward to receive their
own property. Nevertheless the work of such
an association as the English Incorporated
Society of Authors, Playwrights and Com-
posers has not been without its effect even
in that way; it would probably be due to
the good work of this society, for example,
that certain small cheques have found their
way into the pockets pf utterly surprised
Australian literary men.
The latest Australasian development is
fluttering the dovecotes of the “Schools of
Arts” throughout N. S. Wales and, I suppose,
throughout the Commonwealth. The Aus-
tralasian Performing Rights Association, Ltd.,
has issued to each body, person or committee
controlling “premises in which public enter-
tainments, of which music forms a part, are
held, or on the promoter of or concerned with
such entertainments,”' a notice “of the objects
of this association, which has been established
to exercise and enforce the rights and rem-
edies of its members under the Commonwealth
Copyright Act 3911-12 and the New Zealand
CoiHvrig-ht Act 1913 in respect of the public
performance of their musical works.” The
association, which is affiliated with similar
bodies in England, France (the prime mover
in the project), Italy, Spain and Sweden,
calls upon such promoters of entertainments
to pay an annual fee, varying from five
guineas upwards, for the right to allow copy-
right music protected by the association to

And at Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Launceston, Hobart.
be publicly performed in their halls. The
association claims to control the musical
publications of huge numbers of composers,
publishers of many nationalities, and other
copyright owners. To give a public per-
formance of any of these musical composi-
tions without the permission of the owners
of such copyrights or their representatives
is an offence. Thus to play “Marchfita
publicly for a dance, to perform Dvorak’s
“Humoresque” or to sing Brahms’s “Sapphic
Ode” at a public concert without having
secured permission is punishable at law.
Several otherwise honest citizens of my
acquaintance have expressed the opinion that
such a ruling is monstrous. This, however,
merely shows how much education of the
public conscience is needed if the artist is
to reap the legitimate harvest of his work.
What would at the first blush appear to
be the weakness of the system is that it is
to the association and not to the individual
composer the license fee is payable. This,
it is claimed by the association, is got over
by requiring each licensee to forward weekly
lists of the various musical numbers per-
formed and the number of such performances.
The association is thus in a position to assess
the fees due to the composer belonging to
the association.
The experiment—though it is hardly fair
to call it such, as the system has been in
vogue for years, and under it French com-
posers have been, collecting royalties in both
France and Britain- —will be watched wfitli
great interest by all persons conducting enter-
tainments in which music figures. There can
be little doubt that the association is within
its legal rights in its demands; it appears
to be amply in earnest, and if, as it
it prosecutes all those who have hitherto
ignored its demands, a highly interesting, not
to say diverting, situation will be created.
I know at least one committee of a school
of arts that is trying to persuade itself that
it cannot be held responsible for public per-
formances of music held within the hall it
controls. Meanwhile it is being left to chew
over the fact that in the English High Court
of Justice (King’s Court Bench) one Thomp-
son, owner of a cinematograph theatre at
Epsom,had, in consequence of an unauthorised
performance of “Keep the Home Fires Burn-
ing” and of “If You Were the Only Girl
in the World,” to pay £4 damages and costs
which were allowed at £304 9s. Bd. In an-
other case the unauthorised performance of
“Thoughts” waltz and of certain songs in-
volved the defendants, the City of Bradford
Council, in a fine of £lO and costs of £3BB
Bs. 2d.
It begins to appear that, what with the
extension of broadcasting and the efforts of
the Performing Rights Associations of Eng-
land, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Aus-
tralasia, the musical composer, artistic or
otherwise (mostly the latter), is really about
to enter a period of affluence. Or will show-
men commence to study up the out-of-copy-
right works of the great composers?
ALEX. C. WELSH.
The Profession of Impudence
The habit of not caring a button what
you say about your elders and betters is be-
coming very popular. Once or twice in
Twenty-five (Cape) the precocious Beverley
Nichols touches a limit of cold impertinence
undreamed by George Moore at his nastiest.
I suppose Whistler was the most honest
modern founder of this form of ges-
ture. Wilde’s Irish-toady heart generally
failed him at the last moment; besides, he
was always more interested in Wilde than in
his work, a personal gesture which literally
ruled him out. Henley had a political itch,
and was rather a flounderer outside the nar-
row domain of his real work. And Swin-
burne was reserved for his place among the
gods, who saw to it that he wasted little
time at the cheap game.
Not that Nichols, even at the age of 25,
is cheap. He is, on the contrary, extraordi-
narily interesting, because he is wise enough
to tackle his job as an artistic entertainment
rather than as a writing-down of the strict
truth. If you enter the presence of great
or notorious people, determined at all costs
to be unimpressed by them, your chance of
getting the strength of them is no greater
than if you creep in on the bended knee of
acknowledged servility. You come out with
a new false impression instead of the old
one; that is all. This excellent piece of
journalism told me nothing new about
Norman Lindsay or Melba, Bottomley or
Asquith, Elinor Glyn or Valentino, Mase-
field or Hugh Walpole, Carpentier or Pacli-
mann—indeed, such is my elder conceit, I
think most of us could tell Beverley Nichols
a good deal more about many of his figures
than he has, shall we say, had time as yet to
see.
No matter. He made me laugh at about
every second page, and that is a greater gift
than age or observation. “ ‘Do you know,’
Mrs. Patrick Campbell asks, ‘the story of
the old hen that was run over by a Rolls-
Royce? There was a flutter of feathers,
a shrill cackle, and then’ (turning to her
neighbor) ‘what do you think the hen said
as she died? “My God, what a rooster!”’”
That is a fair sample of the stories scat-
tered throughout the book; they all edge
blandly up to the limit, but they are all
funny. Nichols keeps his matter alive in-
geniously by persistently reminding us that
it was ridiculous to find himself interview-
ing a king or Orpen or Kipling at his age;
but that clever bid for sympathy does not
prevent him from being painstakingly im-
pudent to them all. A deft touch in charac-
terisation shows us the superficies of most of
his personages, the pictures of Michael Arlen
and Lipton being particularly vivid. His
manner has loose patches: “ring the heart,”
on page 146. and “either a royal origin, suc-
cess behind the footlights, or delirium
tremens,” on page If 5, are not typographical
errors; he caresses words like “adore” and
“sweet,” “charming” and “divine,” in the
bisexual habit of the insistently ’Varsity
journalist: and he has a too-patent admira-
tion (or adoration, perhaps) of success per
se. But he is stimulating and most amus-
ing in his impudence; one really can’t put
down the book until the last self-conscious
caper in the face of authority has been
thrown.
HILARY LOFTING.
Dewey’s Social Psychology
No thinking person to-day wishes to re-
gard as illegitimate modern psychology s
delving into the complex, mysterious work-
ing of the human mind. Will all ultimately
be revealed?
John Dewey hails from America, and was
for some years connected with Stanford Uni-
versity, but is better known by his contri-
butions to reviews. All his books bear
directly on social problems, the chief of them
being “Human Nature and Conduct.” Many
conclusions contained therein would be con-
troverted by adherents to popular Freudian
interpretations. Yet Dewey does not differ
from the latter school as much as might at
first appear, excelling on the empiric side
as do Freud, Jung and others. In order to
supersede these thinkers, another step re-
mained to be taken, and this is being
achieved by French psychologists, particu-
larly Dr. G. Geley. The psycho-philosophic
speculations of this coterie encompass a far
wider field.
Summed up, the essence of Dewey’s teach-
ing is that the key to social psychology is
an understanding of different types of habit,
while individual mental achievement oper-
ates from impulse, which in its turn is de-
pendent on habit, thus reducing all mind-
functioning to “a system of beliefs, desires
and purposes which are formed in the inter-
action of biological aptitudes with a social
environment.” This denies that mind is
capable of spontaneous creative effort. The
thought is disconcerting.
Explanation of the working of instinct in
man has hitherto caused much disputation
among psychologists. Dewey contends that
our instincts, such as sex, fear, hunger and
so on, are not in themselves single and sepa-
rate, are not specific. An effect often ema-
nates from a multitude of diverse causes.
How arose the artificial simplification of ex-
tolling one particular instinct at the expense
of the remainder? “Social conditions put a
heavy load on certain tendencies, so that in
the end an acquired disposition is treated
as if it were an original and almost the
only original activity.” He thinks the deter-
mining factor throughout is environment,
which is continually changing. At certain
periods in history conditions were so dis-
orderly that the preservation of human life
necessitated extreme alertness and watchful-
ness ; at such times the fear instinct be-
comes highly developed, and would appear
to be the sole urge behind all activity. Nowa-
days, when security and comfort are assured
to a far greater degree, less stress, is laid
upon this instinct. The simplification cur-
rent at present is that all instincts go
back to the sexual—Freud’s trump card.
Here again this judgment only reflects the
existing civilisation —is not necessarily the
effect of fixed impulses of human nature.
To Dewey love as it exists to-day is as
definitely a sign of our prevailing conditions
as are battleships, internal-combustion
engines and electrically-driven machines.
Obviously these latter are not effects of one
distinct cause or force. Neither is the other.
Again, it is known that channels for motor
outlet are comparatively few in man; in
every act the whole organism is concerned
to some extent, and the total state of the
organism is never twice alike. Similar treat-
ment of each instinct dismisses the notion
that activities in general originate from a
single source.
That routine habit plays an immense part
in life cannot be gainsaid ; but is habit irre-
vocable? Dewey contends:—
Habit comes before any ability to evoke thought
at wi11.... ideas, thoughts of ends, are not spon-
taneously generated.... Reason pure of all influ-
ence from prior habit is a fiction. But pure sen-
sations out of which ideas can be framed apart
from habit are equally fictitious.
Surely a vicious circle! If all mentation
depends upon established habits, how account
for original ideas?
Of course, there is impulse. But impulse
is “too chaotic, tumultuous and confused to
be able to know, or engage in reflection or
contemplation.” He asserts tliat the best
result is born of a deliberate combination of
habit and impulse. But this only begs the
question, leaving unanswered the actual
origin of ideas. To believe that mind (sub-
conscious) can function creatively, irrespec-
tive of anything prior, is the only alternative,
thus transcending habitual influences, giving
rise to new truths, speculations, inventions.
This, the orthodox conception, seems more
feasible. Dewey insists rigidly on concrete
facts, but to explain the process of mind-
functioning a deviation from the concrete
is essential. The intangible and superphy-
sical structure of mind renders words clumsy
symbols, having been evolved primarily for
describing the material. Here to feel is
to know.
It is beginning to dawn on investigators
that all cardinal problems of life so far
evade human reason. Much awaits decipher-
ing. After all. do we know just what im-
pulse is? Why? Whence? Whither? We
do not. Let us be honest. Yet throughout
Dewey is challenging, general and compre-
hensive, never confined and subjective, like
so much popular schematising psychology:
he thus stimulates thought and imagination.
Little more can be demanded of a writer.
The rest is in the reader’s hands.
N. D. RATCLIFF.
The Teaching of History
Rupert Hughes, American soldier, play-
wright and novelist, declares that school
children should be taught “historical truths” ;
and these he had not found in textbooks.
So at a meeting of the District of Columbia
Society of the Sons of the Revolution he
threw his bombshell into the distinguished
company by declaring that “George Wash-
ington was a distiller of whisky, a great
cardplaycr and a champion curser. He never
prayed, and consistently avoided participa-
tion in the communion.” Leaders of the
society were shocked: but Hughes was pre-
pared with historical records in support of
his statements, and a descendant of the
“founding father” admits that the historical
records were not misquoted. Certainly the
homage which the young mind is taught to
pay to Washington may constitute a record ;
but, in general, is this attitude necessarily
harmful?
By persistent digging in dusty corners
lapses in the lives of even the best can
generally be revealed. Not even Wordsworth
escapes—he once “paid a visit to France” !
But as a rule the living are inclined to be
kind to the dead. It is better so. For what
the young mind requires is inspiration, and
this will be found in the noble portion of
the lives of men of historical importance.
Let the young be acquainted for the most
part with the Dr. Jekyll in the lives of men
and women. Soon enough, clambering from
out the delectable valley of youth on to the
mountain-tops of maturer life and disillusion-
ment, they will come to learn of Mr. Hyde.

Shakspeare Up to Date
“ ‘ “The Dark Lady of the Sonnets,” ’ said the presi-
dent of the Shakspeare Society (Mr. W. F. Jackson),
addressing a large meeting 'of the committee last
week, ‘has been identified with Miss Mary Fitton,
a member of the Court of Queen Elizabeth, and
with Madame Davenant, the wife of an innkeeper.
It is perhaps more reasonable to suppose that
Shakspeare might have been captivated by the wife
of an innkeeper than by a Court lady.’ ” "
The old eternal question! Who was She?
We ask and ask. Thou smilest and art
still.
Some picture her a maid-in-waiting, Will,
Upon Elizabethan majesty,
A lady of exceeding high degree
Who made of palaces her dwelling-place
And ne’er for whispered scandal gave a
case
To hard-boiled sticklers for morality.
But, William, thou didst inns and taverns
* know
Better than Courts. And She of whom
you sung
May well have been —-’tis surely liker so—
The buxom missus of a jovial Bung.
You fell for her amid the stoups, I trow —
That’s Mr. Jackson’s surmise, anyhow.

A Satchel of Books
Scenic Beauties of the Tweed River District (Direct
Publicity Co.). This district is one of the most
attractive in IST. S. Wales and hitherto has been
but poorly exploited. River, mountain and sea
combine to invest it with a rare beauty and a
charm of variety not excelled by any of the tourist
routes along the eastern coast. The interesting and
comprehensive publication, prepared by the President
of the Murwillumbah Chamber of Commerce (H. H.
Hungerford), should do useful work in attracting
visitors and even permanent residents.
The, Woman Who Knows Herself, by E. Sloan
Chesser. “The comparatively new science of psycho-
logy already promises that, through the understanding
of ourselves, we may win to health and happiness
on this plane of existence.” The quotation expresses
the intention of the writer, a woman M.D., in
publishing her scries of lectures on elementary psy-
chology applied particularly to the difficulties that
beset her own sex. An earnest and, within its
limits, successful effort to bring home to modern
womanhood what modern thought is evolving out of
psychical research.
Mystery Gold, by Bartlett Adamson (Angus and
Robertson). Lovers of pure romance in which the
factor of probability is subordinated to that of
imagination will welcome this novel by an Australian
writer who knows his ground. The book goes from
start to finish without relaxing its hold on the
reader, who, whether he be boy or man, with the
precious legacy of a boy’s love of adventure, will
reach the last page with regret. The scene is an
island group in the South Seas where the “black-
birder” Ripalong meets in the quiet lagoon the
mysterious Shan Fang, a vessel manned by a
Chinese crew whose commander, Ling Loo, is a
polished villain in a group of cut-throat rascals. The
hero of the story is Billy Gordon, a Sydney lad,
who, ignorant of the wild and lawless life of the
old “blackbirding” days, ships on the Ripalong-;
falls foul of her brutal captain; and by a series of
happenings becomes the possessor of a secret cipher.
How Gordon, with the girl Myra, tricks and fights
and finally defeats the wily Ling Loo is told in
a series of breathless chapters, hot on hot. Graphic,
well written and full of sensation.
Berthe Morisot, by Armand Fourreau, translated
by Hubert Wellington (John Lane). One of the
“Masters of Modern Art” series. Berthe knew Corot
and was a pupil of Manet. One of her early pictures
marked an epoch in Impressionism and caused several
of the Paris critics to burst with indignation. We
can view it calmly enough nowadays. The desire
to paint light and nothing but light struggles with
a strong sense of form. She was a well-to-do and
social lady who led an even, prosperous life. The
humors and fashions of her time are delightfully
portrayed in some 40 reproductions.
After Noon, by Susan Ertz (Fisher Unwin). “I
think children nowadays are best left to their own
divorces,” remarked Charles Lever, who at 42 was
the father of two marriageable twin-daughters thrown
on his hands, 20 years before*, by a wife who, having
found romance and a lover, had deserted husband
and children. Charles had not sought divorce and
re-marriage but was content with the society of
the twins. Good-humored, despite the cynical twist
the faithless wife had given him, he looked with
amused tolerance at the comedy of love and manners
played between his daughters and their suitors and
became drawn into the tangle of the sex-play
himself. An amusing novel, with clear sketches
of character, it sustains the standard of “Madame
Claire.”
Dance-drama, by Terence Gray (Heffer). “When
an art comes under the sway of commerce there
is,” says the author, “a damnable tendency to
stereotype its technique.” To lift the dance, as an
expression of dramatic art, out of the rut into which
it has fallen is Mr. Gray’s task. The theatre should
be, he holds, something more than a mere means
of diversion, dnd in its fullest expression the dance
as an instrument of dramatic art will hold a high
place. Of particular interest at the moment is
the author’s opinion of the Russian ballet. This
is still patronised by the wealthy, who are content
to be “dimly conscious of a kaleidoscope of pretty,
harmoniously-moving colors and pleasing musical
vibrations. It has also a following of a certain type
of degenerate artist, and a sprinkling of vital and
intelligent admirers who recognise in it isolated
qualities of greatness—such as the superlative tech-
nical attainment of its dancers, individually and in
mass movement —and in some of the musical and
pictorial material which it employs. But of serious
dramatic quality it has nothing whatever, and as a
factor in the development of the art of the theatre
it is as dead as the C'ommedia dell’ Arte.” Much
of the book is devoted to experiments in theatrical
presentment; for example, the use of luminous
screens. Interesting and suggestive.
“M.G.S.”: Some day a psycho-analyst will apply
to the psychology of the leaders of the modernist
movement in art and literature the methods Dr.
Maclaurin applied to kings and queens. The material
is accumulating. Verlaine wrote his poems in a
state of semi-lunacy exacerbated by absinthe. Baude-
laire, steeped in hashish, died of G.P. The sexually-
starved lunatic Van Gogh, rebuffed by women, turned
first to religion and then to painting, and finally
climbed a tree and shot himself. His friend Gauguin,
the heir, as he wrote, of “the long and fatal heritage
of the vices of a morally and physically corrupt
society,” fled to the South Seas, found them morgues,
went back to France and painted them as such,
finally returning, an old man, to the Marquesas. An
island correspondent writes me that he has died
there. A French priest sent a native toi make sure
he was really dead, which the emissary did by biting
the corpse’s throat out, a pleasant custom of that
island. If Gaugin could have commented on his own
end, he would have exclaimed, “Ah, what a supreme
work of art! ”

The Garden in the Woods.
Dear lady of the faded dress
And eartli-soiled saffron gloves,
There steals upon the air’s caress
Some fragrance of your loves.
The Roman violet in March
Through sweeter dew might shine
Beneath the thorned and leafless arch
Of waiting eglantine.
And when the ancient chestnuts raised
Their candles to the sun
The pansies of the north land blazed
In webs your hands had spun.
And this for hope and that for thought
And one for merry hours,
Glade-gardens of the woods you taught
The wisdom of the flowers.
Through scent of honey from the hive
And sweet of new-made bread
I see you glowing and alive
Till all the years are dead.
Plumes of the hearse, pine of the pyre,
Wine spilled for ease of heart,
Long wailings of a lost desire,
Fierce clamor of the mart —
All these are but the dust of dust —
Cold leaves the woods let fall—
In you the young, clear stars have trust,
A queen above them all.
Amid your garden, dear and first,
A crystal water drips;
A man-soul quenched an ageless thirst
Upon your faithful lips.
The stream that makes no count of years
Has kept the mosses green ;
The great trees, whispering to their peers,
Above it, yearning, lean.
Dear lady of the faded dress
And earth-soiled saffron gloves,
The stream of a great blessedness
Is his who drinks and loves.

Heroes.
The children dream of Guinea gold
Where luring cities gleam afar;
Their heroes are of grander mould
Than their accustomed neighbors are,
Who never strive to chain a star.
The children wake to knowledge when
Some Phaeton overturns his car;
For heroes are but common men.
We who have met with heroes, heard
With blinded hearts the wild acclaim
Which honors greatness, take the word
And measure manhood with the name;
For we have seen the cup ot fame
Bring wise men low to folly, then
Have bowed our heads and shared the shame —
For heroes are but common men.
Our neighbors go by quiet streets
Or climb with care the weary hill;
The laughter that our laughter meets
Was born in hearts despair might fill.
But valor fights by hope until
The silent battle turns again;
And common men are heroes still,
While heroes are but common men.
Here high achievement mates with pride.
We have more need of vision when
The commonplace is glorified ;
For heroes are but common men.

In Fancy.
High-windowed is the room
From which I gaze afar
On hills that darkly loom
Unlit by moon or star.
On sown and fallow fields
Stillness and silence dwell;
No sound the darkness yields,
No voice to break their spell.
Ghostlike is every tree,
Deep-brooding, still and tall,
As though dark secrecy
Held leaf and limb in thrall.
My fancy ventures forth
To tread, with seeking eyes,
A road that south and north
Beneath me dimly lies.
Upon that winding road
She, slowly faring on,
Meets many folk that strode
Its miles long years agone.
Some walk with limbs that drag
And feet that dully tramp,
And some with shouldered swag
Move on from camp to camp.
She sees, though no star gleams
On hollow or hill-crest,
Ghost-teamsters by ghost-teams
Trudge onward, whips at rest.
Horsemen in silence pass,
Tough-sinewed, eyes aglow;
Such men as now, alas,
Nor camps nor highways know.
Toil-hardened horsemen, tried
By road and route and track,
Behind horned mobs they ride,
And soundless stockwhips crack.
This, this my fancy sees
As she fares, strange of mood,
’Mid stirless roadside trees
That o’er some secret brood.

TASMANIA ASKS FOR £545,000 PER
ANNUM.
The Tasmanian Government has put on
paper its plea for some steady assistance
from the Federal Treasury, the figure men-
tioned being £545,000 per annum. Two rea-
sons are given. One is that even w-ith the
heaviest direct taxation in the Common-
wealth the island can no longer pay its way,
and that unless relief comes it must cease
“to function as a solvent and effective mem-
ber of the Australian Federation.” The
other is that taxation must be reduced in-
stead of increased, because it has reached a
point at which it is strangling industry and
causing an actual decline of population. In
other words, if taxation stays where it is
revenue will go down, and if taxation goes
up revenue will go down further, through
the dying away of the national income which
provides revenue. That is a way which
excessive taxation has, especially when there
is any less-taxed place available fof popula-
tion and industry to move to. This is illus-
trated by the familiar statement in books
of reference about many once-prosperous
centres after they fell into the hands of the
Turk: “Owing to the exactions of the gov-
ernors the city gradually fell into decay, and
became a ruinous village.” The statement
that Tasmania is unable to pay its way is
frank and unusual, but not extraordinary.
Many Australian institutions are in the same
situation. One is the Northern Territory,
though, by reason of the fact that it has
land borders, the curse of isolation hasn’t
fallen on it so heavily as on the island State.
Another is the Federal railway system,
which dropped £356,990 in a recent year,
and would have lost more but that much
interest-bearing debt has been paid off. A third
is the Commonwealth shipping line, which lost
£593,879 last year, despite that millions of
lost capital had been written off to make its
accounts look better, and it appears likely to
make regular demand for a larger subsidy
than Tasmania is seeking. Westralia, too, col-
lected a cheque for £450,000 the other week
on the plea that it is unable to carry its own
burdens. It asks that the grant be made an
annual affair, and is also in search of a £1
per-oz. subsidy on gold production. Like-
wise there are poor financial expectations
concerning Canberra. Shortage is the badge
of all our tribe.
* * * *
Tasmania was never classed as rich. Its
revenue and expenditure were both always
low, and when it joined the Commonwealth
it was the earthen pot among brass vessels.
Before it terminated its separate existence
its railway returns per head were the poor-
est among the six States, partly because its
insular position made steamboat competition
intense, and partly through lack of genius,
which is a scarce commodity everywhere. Its
public lands revenue per head was the lowest
bar that of Victoria. Much of Tasmania is
only fine scenery (not that there is much of
Tasmania of any kind), and a comparatively
dense population had absorbed most of the
rest. The people taxed themselves much
more heavily than the average under the cus-
toms and excise headings, and Federation
brought an unlooked-for result. For a num-
ber of years each State got back from
the Commonwealth the amount of revenue
collected in its territory under the uniform
tariff, whereby the previous low-tariff com-
munities wallowed in affluence, while the
liigh-tariff ones had nothing to wallow in
but deficit. This applied to all save West-
ralia, whose! astute rulers negotiated a sepa-
rate tariff for themselves. The second year
of uniform customs and excise showed these
results: —
Gain per
Inhabitant for Year.
New South Wales .. . . £l3 5
Westralia .. .. .. 18 8
Victoria .. .. .. 2 7
South Australia .. .. 2 3
Loss.
Queensland .. .. .. 14 4
Tasmania . . . . . . 16 0
Tasmania lost 15J per cent, of its entire
revenue at the outset of the new system,
and fell into difficulties immediately. Queens-
land lost 7i per cent, of revenue. The others
profited, and the two that profited most
grumbled most. When the subsidy system
superseded the “Braddon Blot” system the
annual grant was fixed at so much per head,
and not apportioned, as in some countries,
according to the supposed needs of each pro-
vince. Tasmania got an extra subsidy be-
ginning in 1912 (Westralia had secured one
in 1910), and this enabled it to show some
headway for a time. But it was out of the
way of Federal benefits such as railways,
and it made no unearned increment or other
profit out of the Federal capital. It col-
lected neither sugar nor cotton bonuses. And
a few years ago the Navigation Act struck
it, as the one island State, a stunning blow.
The miscellaneous ships by means of which
it traded with miscellaneous places were
driven away almost unanimously. Tas-
mania was reduced in an unusual degree to
a trade with the adjacent corner of the main-
land which was costly and, being all con-
ducted on the Australian high-wage system,
also involved expensive transhipment devices.
The service was precarious part of the time,
and non-existent the rest of the time.
* * * *
So Tasmania became a good place for
grown people not to start business in, and
for ambitious growing people to leave. In
one source of income it has a good lead over
its neighbors—it collects far more in old-age
pensions, proportionately to population, than
any of them because more per cent, of its
population is old. The island can’t econo-
mise by closing its schools, which seems to
be the only remaining economy in sight, for
that would mean a fall into barbarism, and
barbarism doesn’t pay. It can’t recall the
dubious financial past any more than its
dubious neighbors can. As its Government
points out, it can cease to be a solvent (or
cease to be a fully solvent) member of the
Commonwealth, and file the first schedule,
but it is hardly, to be imagined that that
would pay the Commonwealth. If the Fed-
eral authority won’t partly meet the case by
abolishing its very unsuccessful Navigation
Act it can’t be said with certainty that the
proposed subsidy of £545.000 per aniium is
excessive. There is the dismal future to be
provided for, as well as the dismal present.
An infinitely better form of relief than any
money grant (which is liable to be mis
spent) would be for the Commonwealth to
relieve Tasmania, upon strict conditions, of
the half of its public debt which is held
abroad, and which calls for payment in gold.
The principal condition ought to be that Tas-
mania should take an oath on the family
Bible and also make it an article of its con-
stitution that it would incur no more debts,
State, municipal or otherwise, outside the
Commonwealth. This would represent about
the measure of relief required, and unless
the Federal credit is pretty bad it should be
able to malse savings when conversion day
comes round. If Tasmania was freed from
its gold debt in London it would be out of
that constant drift Londonward to borrow
gold with which to pay gold interest in
London, and it might consequently become
a shining light and an example. Incidentally,
unless the Commonwealth can get out of that
drift itself, its own light may cease to shine.
SYDNEY’S SILLY SEASON.
That section of the Sydney press which
spices its sporting columns with sensa-
tionalism is always amusing, in its fashion,
at Cup time. Cup time is Sydney’s Silly
season, and the newspapers in question
make the most of it. After the first day's
racing at Randwick a Sunday print came
out with the assertion that “conservative esti-
mates place £3,000,000 as the amount that
changed hands during the day.” It went on
to explain that, “with 80,000 persons at the
course, and with wagers scaling up from
ss. to more than £3OOO on each race, the
£3,000,000 figure is low.” The official re-
port shows that the totalisators held £10,592
15s. on the first race (this amount, less 121
p.c. and fractions of sixpences, was, of course,
distributed among the successful punters),
£3610 ss. on the second race, £33,797 ss. on
the third (and principal) race, £18,103 15s.
on the fourth, £7849 15s. on the fifth, and
£19,337 10s. on the sixth; total, £93,291 ss.
What McShortodds handled is known only
to that person, but it certainly wasn't
£2,906,708 15s. or even the half or the third
of it—a tenth would be nearer the mark.
The amount actually staked was no doubt a
great deal more than a community with a
Himalayan foreign debt could afford to risk
in so desperately unproductive a way, but
the “conservative estimate of £3,000,000” is
absurd.
* * * *
Another silly-season announcement was
that £5OOO had been wagered in one day on
a double, Valicare for the Doncaster Handi-
cap and Heroic for the Sydney Cup. This
was too much for Heroic’s trainer, who is
recorded to have “expressed amusement,”
and to have “pointed out that, had such an
amount been staked, Heroic, in the event of
Valicare winning, would be racing for be-
tween two and three hundred thousand
pounds.” As it happened, a steed which gave
the ring a “skinner” won the Sydney Cup.
Had some fancied animal come home the
public would assuredly have been informed
that Rlinks or Smithers, the big punter,
had landed £40,000 or £50,000 on the double.
Such narratives, though familiar, are improb-
able for several reasons. One is that Mc-
Siiortodds is too canny to let Blinks or
Smithers despoil him of £40,000 or £50,000.
Another is that the big punter is usually a
secretive person who dislikes reporters with
a bent for sensationalism, and would rather
kick them than take them into his confidence.
A third reason, closely connected with the
second, is that the successful plunger is no
more exempt from income-taxation than the
successful publican. Should a man win
£50,000 in N. S. Wales, and the Taxation
Commissioners get to hear of it, he is liable
to pay the highest Federal rate of ss. in the
£, which begins at £7601, and the highest
State rate of 2s. in the £, which begins at
£7OOl, or £17,500 out of his £50,000. Of
course, he is entitled to deduct losses from
wins, but he would have a cold time per-
suading the tax-gatherers (especially the
State crowd if he were a sojourner in the
State) that he had lost £50,000 in other
transactions or anything like it. So if the
Morning Mares nest declares that Smith-
ers struck a £50,000 double it is safe to con-
clude (1) that the information didn’t come
from Smithers, (2) that it is an exaggera-
tion, and (3) that it made Smithers very
wild indeed. The reporter perhaps got it
from some bookmaker who doesn’t love
Smithers, or who has some other reason for
pulling the scribe’s leg. As to that, it is
periodically alleged, to the extreme delight
of gents, who live on the game, that Jinks,
who is noted for his caution, has laid a for-
tune against the favorite, and that Blithers,
whose limit is popularly understood to be
“the odds to a tenner,” has paid out £5OOO
to one punter, £3OOO to another, £2OOO to
a third, and so on, as a result of his dashing
three-figure bets. Some of these trans-
actions are evidently eyewash for the Taxa-
tion Commissioners, although they are doubt-
less published in good faith.
* * * *
One of the afternoon papers tried to im-
port a bit of seriousness into the silly season
by attacking an ancient evil. It complained
that Sydney and all the sizable N. S. Wales
towns swarmed with starting-price book-
makers, which is true, and demanded to
know why the police did not wipe them out.
The police were silent, but they might have
replied, forcibly enough, that their num-
bers are too few to make any impression on
the s.-p. army, and that, in any case, the
s.-p. interest has powerful protectors. In
the time of the late “Nationalist” Govern-
ment they raided some of the principal bet-
ting-shops in Sydney and were about to
prosecute, with the assurance of obtaining
convictions, when they were ordered to drop
the proceedings and had to obey. The Nation-
alists were succeeded by a party which gets
strong support from bookmakers, and the
feeling exists that to interfere with certain
of these gentry might cost a policeman his
job or, at least, result in his being transferred
to some remote and inhospitable hapalet
where the prospect of promotion is bleak.
There is likewise the important fact that the
s.p. banditti of the shop and street-corner are
patronised almost exclusively by the wage-
earning class. Inasmuch as they pay no rac-
ing-club fees and dodge the income-tax and
stamp duties on betting tickets, they are
blacklegs on their licensed brethren and bilk-
ers of the State which Political Labor
aims at making the universal employer, but
that doesn’t seem to worry either their
patrons or their protectors. If the will to
eradicate the s.p. plague really existed in
the right quarter the thing could be done
swiftly and at no great expense. All that
is necessary is to prohibit the publication
of “the weights” except on official cards pur-
chasable only inside the racecourse gates,
and to see that the ordinance is made effect-
ive. But this would mean, among other
things, that the racing reporters would have
to be put on work more worthy of their
talents (which, in most cases, are consider-
able) than reviewing “the weights,” com-
piling form-at-a-glance sections, and so
forth, and it wouldn’t suit the afternoon
paper’s book.
THAT BLESSED WORD MESPOT.
In inverse proportion to our intelligence and
education we are hypnotised by the constant
repetition of catchwords and phrases. This
fact is well recognised in the art of adver-
tising, and forms also one of the most power-
ful weapons of press and political leaders.
It is made to serve for the conveyance of
theories that would otherwise gain no pass-
age to the attention. It is almost impossible,
without definite conscious effort, to avoid
falling under the influence of such phrases;
but if we once come to realise the danger of
our judgment being thus drugged, the avoid-
ance of the danger rests with ourselves.
The brain, although capable of bearing
much ill-use and of withstanding a consider-
able amount of fatigue, is naturally lazy, and
is inclined to follow the easy path and to
accept the ideas thrust upon it unless com-
pelled by the will to examine and pass judg-
ment upon them. The more commonly used
and the better advertised the catchwords the
more insidious, then, the danger, and the
more thorough and critical should be our
weighing of them.
The avenues through which catch-phrases
enter our consciousness are the eye and the
ear. Of these the eye is the more important,
as the written word reaches more individuals
than does the voice of the orator, and the
cinema is visited by more people than the
drama. Tin) increasing popularity of broad-
casting may in time cause the ear to become
the more important avenue of approach; but
that time is not yet.
Catchwords utterly without meaning or
applied in an incorrect manner are in con-
stant use as political propaganda, and in
most cases are passed without question.
When examined without prejudice, they are
obvious shams. They are merely examples
of false application of words; our lazy brain
accepts the proffered idea in order to avoid
the effort of thought. As examples of
the mental anaesthesia induced we have the
effects produced by the common use of such
expressions as “wage-slave,” “scab,” “bour-
geois” and “proletariat.” These terms have
all been, invented or imported by political
adventurers and are successfully used by
them and their mentally indolent playthings.
While people are thus doped, almost any
poisonous or nauseous rubbish is acceptable
to the palate of the uncritical. Doctrines
whose sheer foolishness or flagrant wicked-
ness would be apparent to the least intelli-
gent if offered without camouflage are greed-
ily swallowed when accompanied by one of
these catchwords designed to give mental
comfort, just as “that blessed word Mesopo-
tamia” gave solace to the old lady.
Were a foreign strife-monger to tell an
audience of Australian workers that they
individually were inferior beings, that they
were without voice in the occupation or
career of theniselves or sons, that their
amusements, food, hours of work, and even
their wives, were arranged for them and were
subject to the bounty of a master-class to
whose clemency they owed any poor comfort
they possess, and who had the right to inflict
even physical pains and penalties on their
persons, such orator would be treated as a
new and amusing kind of lunatic. But the
same audience will listen with admiration to
the same orator if he uses the magic phrase
“wage-slave,” and will then swallow almost
any specious or pernicious argument he
chooses to present. Mob-psychology comes in
here. Each member of the audience knows that
he is not a slave, and would contemptuously re-
ject any suggestion that he had no control
over his treasured wage; but as part of a
crowd he is actually pleased at being called
a slave. Individually lie knows well that
there is no such thing (in the sense used by
the orator) as a master-class, and would hate
to acknowledge that he has any superiors;
but as a unit of the crowd he is dragooned
into foolish acts opposed to his own interests
in the course of a “war” against a thing that,
as* an individual, he knows does not exist.
Again, the use of the ugly and stupid word
“scab” will stir up feelings of enmity against
a neighbor whom he well knows to be an
excellent chap. If this word has any mean-
ing it should be' considered a compliment, as
scabbing is part of the process of healing—
an important part of the great vis medicatriw
Naturce. The volume of false sentiment and
ludicrous economic principles that a crowd
will swallow if the taste is disguised by a
liberal use of this term is a typical example
of what a catchword can do in doping the
intelligence of the individual.
Two drugs that are of proved efficacy are
the words “proletariat” and “bourgeois.”
The average member of an audience com-
monly associates “proletariat” with the Rus-
sian serf or farm-laborer, and really believes
that this particular brand of the proletariat
rules Russia. There was, and still is, a
proletariat in Russia. It is racially Asiatic,
though most of the rest of Asia is not at all
proud of it. The bulk of the inhabitants
are mixed descendants of Mongols of a type
inferior to the Chinese morally, intellectually
and physically, and are in a state of culture
and comfort equivalent to that of the Euro-
pean peasant of five centuries ago. If the
white working-man realised the present state
of the Russian proletariat, whose condition
has, if possible, been altered for the worse
by the substitution of the present German
and Jewish master-class for the murdered
Nordic minority who ruled prior to the revo-
lution, he would assault the man who had
the temerity to compare him with it. He
does not seem to comprehend that he repre-
sents the very bourgeoisie that he is told to
hate —that is, if he is one of the large class
of workers who possess an account in the
Savings Bank, ci-edit at the butcher’s, or a
deposit on his house or furniture. As a
matter of fact, events show that he is cap-
able of believing almost anything if it is
but accompanied by one or other of these
magic words of comfort, even that “a rising
of the proletariat” (which does not exist
in Australia) and the slaughter of the bour-
geoisie (which is himself and neighbors)
would bring about the Millennium —which,
by the way, is another potent catchword.
A Medical Alienist.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Delayed by Interruption of Line.
Dear Buixetin, —The complaint about the
delay to telegraph business registered by the
recent Chamber of Commerce conference at
Sydney was more than justified. Speaking
as a telegraphist of many years’ experience,
,it has always been a mystery to me how the
Australian business public tolerated the ser-
vice. Recently a Sydney shipping man
cabled to London and telegraphed to Mel-
bourne, in each case asking for a reply. The
cable supplied it in four hours dead. The
reply from Melbourne limped in 18 hours
later marked “Delayed by interruption” and
“Correction to follow —one word short.” It


had been lodged in Melbourne at 3 p.m., and
was delivered in Sydney next morning, a he
missing word —the only one that really mat-
Sed-arrived at 10.30 a.m. All of which is
only another way of saying that to such an
extent has the Commonwealth lelegraph
Branch failed that the other side of the
planet can be communicated with more expe-
ditiously than can a neighboring Australian
city Australian-Amcrican cables average
quicker delivery than Sydney suburban tele-
grams. The Department’s pet reason— De-
layed by interruption to lines” —is in very
many cases a polite prevarication. No less
than 50 per cent, of the Brisbane-Sydney-
Melbourne traffic, and 90 per cent, of South
and West Australian business to the Eastern
States, is delivered so marked. But if lines
were interrupted as often as alleged (even if
true a sorry enough admission) the business
would never get through. Take the inter-
state traffic. The reason for delay here is
that, owing to ceaseless experiment and
trouble with machine systems of telegraphy
and changing from one system to another,
the long lines that link the capital cities are
not 40 per cent, efficient. The Department is
machine mad. It was decided, about six years
ago, to supersede the Wheatstone automatic
telegraph. The Murray multiplex system was
installed on a Melbourne-Sydney circuit. It
was, and still is, a failure. Apparently the
Telegraph heads hadn’t thought of that possi-
bility. Contracts for further sets had been
signed, and, though the Department squirmed,
the sets continued to arrive; total cost,
£162.000. After two years of effort and
ever-increasing delay to business it was de-
cided to try another system—the Creed.
Five sets were purchased for £2500. One
working after a fashion and four in hospital
is the Creed average. Then it was thought
that the Murray might do better with Mork-
rum printers. Gear that cost thousands was
promptly dumped and the printers installed.
No improvement resulted. Next the Teletype
system was given a trial and found wanting.
One set was purchased. The city offices look
like museums. With this battery of sys-
tems all assisting to delay the business, the
Department now proposes to install another
—the carrier-wave. Had a month’s success-
ful trial been demanded (a reasonable propo-
sition) none of them would have been pur-
chased. American experience has proved that
300 miles (i.e., about half the distance that
separates the closest Australian capitals) is
the utmost range of high-speed telegraphy.
Alf McGrath, State telegraph engineer for
N. S. Wales, informed the Telegraph heads of
this fact before the Murray was purchased,
but was over-ruled. Soon afterwards Mr.
McGrath resigned. The Department is in-
vited to show where, with one exception, any
of the multifarious systems is giving satis-
faction over a greater distance than 300
miles. The one exception is the Wheatstone,
to which the 300-mile limitation does not
apply. It was to have been dumped when
(a) the Murray multiplex, (b) the Creed,
(e) the Morkrum printers and ( d ) tlieTeletype
were installed. Presumably it is to be fur-
ther dumped after the very complicated car-
rier-wave arrives. The fact that after six
years the Wheatstone is still in existence
proves the futility of all those systems. Never
a day in the past six years but it has had
to be brought into action—the Department
dare not remove it. Admittedly it isn’t so
fast as the other systems, but it never stops.
It is an easy matter to show that, using the
Wheatstone for ordinary telegrams and press
matter and handworking for urgent traffic,
cables, etc., already existing circuits could
easily cone with the telegraph traffic. Well,
then, why isn’t this done? Because the
Wheatstone hand-working combination isn’t
tried till every other system has failed.
The Department should be compelled,
under supervision other than its own,
to give the Wheatstone hand-working
team a run first—not last. N. S. Wales
country traffic is also subject to con-
siderable preventable delay. The Wheat-
stone, which is a cheap machine and prac-
tically everlasting, should be more largely
availed of, particularly for “cross” business
(i.e.. biz. for re-transmission). Using exist-
ing facilities, there is no good reason why
every message lodged up to 5.45 p.m, should
not be delivered that day. Instead, every-
thing lodged after about 4 p.m. is delivered
next day—-still labelled Telegram ! —Yours,
Ex-Teeegraphirt.

Barbarous Housing; in the Tropics.
In his report to the iCommonwoalth Govern-
ment last year, Buchanan, the British engi-
neer, referring to social conditions in North
Queensland and the Northern Territory,
wrote that he had been “deeply impressed by
the unsuitable houses and food, the hard life
of the women and the amazing ignorance
generally of tropical hygiene.” For this he
was roundly abused by patriots of the Jef-
ferson Brick order; • but Dr. Cieento,
Director of the Institute of Tropical Medi-
cine at Townsville, has collected evidence
which shows that the critic was not talking
through his hat. And Dr. Cilento is no
enemy of the White Australia policy, such
as Buchanan was accused of being; on the
contrary, he is probably its most ardent, cer-
tainly its most authoritative, supporter. His
enthusiasm has even survived the discovery,
made in the course of a recent examination,
that many North Queenslanders “live under
the most distressing circumstances”; he
notes, indeed, that “these tropical lands are
being steadily and progressively peopled by
a healthy, working white population,” and
that even where “the worst conditions” rule,
“the high standard of health is still main-
tained.” Some of the facts presented by Dr.
Cieento are particularly discreditable to the
Labor crowd which has run Queensland since
1915 and added nearly 40 millions to the
public debt, which in that year was only
57 millions. In Ohillagoe, where the Labor
Government has been the Ideal Employer
of socialist theory since 1921, the investi-
gator found that “64 p.c. of the cottages
were built entirely of iron” :
Over half of these were erected by the Queensland
Government for the employees of the State smelters
and mines. The cottages occupied by the staff are
moderately comfortable, consisting of four r00m5....
The cottages for the other employees are smaller,
haying a verandah in front only. These cottages are
neither lined nor ceiled, and are appallingly hot
during the day, but cool quickly at night.
Four-roomed iron cottages, neither lined nor
ceiled and with only a front verandah—the
kitchen may be left to the imagination ! Such
is a Labor Government’s contribution to the
solving of the tropical housing problem. It
has spent money like water in divers foolish
ways but it condemns these Chillagoe people
to live and have their being and bring up
their children in enlarged ovens. At CloU-
curry, moreover, the railway employees dwell
in Government cottages “built of wood and
consisting of three rooms, 12 x 10, and
detached iron kitchen, an overhanging roof,
projecting out about 3ft., acting as a sub-
stitute for a front verandah.” The next Gov-
ernment might profitably inquire whether the
chronic discontent in the State railway ser-
vice is not due in large measure to bar-
barous housing. At Julia Creek, a hamlet
on the Townsville-Cloncurry railway, with
a population of 150, “made up of Govern-
ment officials, railway employees, trades-
people, land-agents and teamsters’ families,
many of the women, teamsters' wives in par-
ticular, were “living under very uncomfort-
able conditions, some having one room only,
and that unceiled, unlined and with no floor-
ing-boards ; several have to carry water long
distances three and four times a week.” And
this in the tropics ! As regards general con-
ditions, 5S p.c. of the cottages at Julia Creek,
35 p.c. of those at Chillagoe, 30 p.c. at Ather-
ton and 33 p.c. at Cloncurry had no baths or
bathing facilities; not half of them had ice-
chests, except at Atherton, where the pro-
portion was just 50 p.c.; from 30 p.c. to 50
p.c. of the yards were dirty; and a large
proportion of the household tanks were not
screened against mosquitoes, which bring
malaria and other tropical diseases, ltaby
clinics and playgrounds for children are
lacking in the smaller N.Q. towns; and in
the larger towns, such as Townsville, Cairns
and Charters . Towers, there is a serious
dearth of accommodation for working girls.
If these young women hogged beer, the Gov-
ernment would no doubt build State hotels
for their benefit; as it is, apart from the
lucky ones who can get into denominational
or Y.W.C.A. hostels, they are offered no alter-
native to “boarding-houses which are noted
for their faulty hygiene, and are often hot
and overcrowded —there are hundreds of girls
willing to pay 355. to £2 2s. p.w. for suit-

$
Dad’s Deficit.
If there were a stronger Opposition in the
House of Commons Winston Churchill’s
first financial year would be a source of
anxiety to the Baldwinites. The gentleman
who arranged the Gallipoli fiasco and
smoked Corona Coronas so engagingly at
the Admiralty made a number of promises
in his Budget, and they have not been car-
ried out. Summed up, they amounted to a
definite pledge to reduce expenditure by 10
millions. Instead, expenditure has soared
30 millions higher. It is true that
Churchill’s benevolent chief made him an
unexpected present of a liability for 19 mil-
lions for a coal subsidy, which the Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer claims has con-
verted a surplus of five millions into a deficit
of 14 millions. But it is to be doubted if
that is a fair claim. The coal subsidy may
deserve all that has been said about it as
an unsound subterfuge with an inevitable
and unpleasant aftermath pinned to its tail,
but its effect on Churchill’s balance-sheet
has not been all bad. Revenue has improved
by millions compared with the previous
year, and it is not unreasonable to assume
that part at least of this improvement is a
reflection of the recovery of the iron and
steel trades and the lessening of unemploy-
ment generally that has been a feature of
the last eight months —the period in which
the subsidy has been operative. Baldwin’s
Government has had a lot of luck so far—
the Locarno Pact, the settlement of the Irish
boundary squabble and the recognition of a
war-debt liability by Mussolini have been
grateful and comforting occurrences —but
its habit of staving off evils with a short-
dated p.n. on posterity, in a MiCAWBER-like
hope that something will turn up, makes its
path increasingly hard to tread. On the
first of next month the miners, led by red-
capped Comrade Cook, must be told what
Baldwin and Churchill propose to do
with them and their industry. The best
answer Baldwin lias been able to think of
to date is a plan for reducing the amount
of coal required for domestic use by turning
it into electric power. But that is not
an immediate remedy, and it means, spending
a great deal of money. Until it is in full
working order and has brought about a
transfer of thousands of miners to other
occupations a livelihood must be found .for
men who know no job but coal-hewing,
who refuse to work more than 42 houi’s a
week at that, and who threaten a social up-
heaval if they are not paid a bigger wage
than their industry can earn. Some of John
Bull’s chickens have been many a year on
their way home to roost, but there are a few
sweet little fledglings waiting very near the
perch—among them the dole and the coal
subsidy.
The Coming Surplus.
“Another big Federal surplus” is antici-
pated for June 30, because nine months of
the financial year have passed and the tariff
revenue is looking up handsomely; and if
it turns from expectation to 'realisation,
there will be the usual demand for reduced
duties and more importations, and there
will be demands for petty jobs and dona-
tions and other demands. In reality there
is room for doubt about the paper surpluses
in which the Federal Treasurer is supposed
to wallow, lie had a deficit in 1921-22.
Then he had three surpluses in paper money,
the middle one being much the largest. These
made it possible to pay off some of the
paper or local debt, but they did nothing
to help with the foreign or gold debt. Yet
that is what really matters; for Australia
has sunk into a lethargic frame of mind,
and no longer hustles to find an adequate
gold revenue to pay foreign interest with —
it is content to make up the shortage by
borrowing some more hard coin at the old
address. The Federal local or paper debt
decreased in 1924, under the influence of the
surpluses, from about 284 millions to a trifle
over 273 millions, but it soon got over the
shock of being partly paid off, and
last September it was well over 290
millions. As for the Federal gold debt, it
grew from 142 J millions at June, 1924, to
i 66 millions at September, 1925, partly
through the Commonwealth helping the five
Loan Council States and partly through
the Commonwealth helping itself. All this
makes the Federal surplus look rather like
the army of the last Neapolitan kings—good
for any purpose except the one which a sur-
plus or an army is most wanted for. If
there is really a mass of revenue unspent at
the close of the financial year it would be
best for the Treasurer to resist demands for
petty aids and gratuities, to go slow on tax
reductions, and put his paper wealth into the
prompt completion of an unencumbered rail-
way across the continent. By making avail-
able a great province which is strongly sus-
pected of mineral riches the Commonwealth
might so greatly increase its exportable pro-
duce as to relieve, or even save, the financial
situation. If the result wasn’t wholly up
to expectations the Government could at least
say with honest pride that it had supplied
employment, had made a pleasing sensation,
and had advertised Australia far and wide
as a place where enterprise is not dead. Then
it could proceed to compile another paper
surplus.
*
The Offal Australia Bats.
Lifting up his voice at, or in the vicinity
of, the Sydney Show, an eminent cattle gen-
tleman said that Australians live on offal
so far as their own products are concerned.
The best, he said, is none too good for Aus-
tralians, and they get a great deal of the
worst. High-quality cheese, butter, bacon
and meat (one report accused the speaker
of adding wheat) are exported, while inferior
goods are consumed here, and the local citizen
is said to pay more in many cases for semi-
offal than the outsider pays him for prize
victuals. It is sad, and it looks ridiculous;
but if it is true there are reasons for it.
The situation may be put categorically in
this wise:—
Australia imports an utterly absurd quantity of
goods, chiefly manufactured. Many farming and
grazing characters, who think (though without proper
thinking apparatus) that they could get cheaper
machinery abroad, want it to import more. All
importers want it to import more.
This situation is due partly to the insufficiency
of local manufactures and partly to the luxurious
ways of the people. The slow-going day-labor habit,
industrial disturbances, an inferior tariff and the
discouragement of small industrial towns in the
interests of Congestion all help.
The imports can’t all be paid of the pro-
ceeds of alleged “public works” loans floated in
London and New York. The great bulk of the
account has to be settled by the export of produce.
The foreign buyer, having so many anxious sellers
to choose from, is particular, not to say faddy, about
his imported produce. Therefore all manner of in-
spectors are paid to see that the surplus produce
sent abroad is of the best, and that the offal remains
here.
If the local person, as alleged, pays more for
stringy Australian food than the foreign individual
does for a superior article, it is the fortune of war.
The foreign market is a competitive one and takes
what it wants at a' competitive price. The local
market isn’t competitive and takes what it can get.
The cattle gentleman, being probably a Free-
trader, didn’t suggest a remedy; but there
is one. First, however, things are likely to
get worse. The influx of new outside loan
money must greatly decrease, because the
pace has grown out of all reason, and the
familiar old money-market is becoming both
depleted and worried. If at any time loans
should cease, then imports will have, to
be wholly paid for with exports, and three
courses will be open. One is to send away more
primary produce. That isn’t hopeful. The
quantity of all sorts exported in 1923-24
was less than in 1922-23, and that year
was worse than 1913. The prices improved
over those of 1913, but there is no assurance
that they will improve further to help out
the situation, and they may recede. Even
if Australia lived a much more offally exist-
ence than it does, the benefit would be
limited. Or this country, under stress of
necessity, may greatly reduce its bill for
imports by cutting off luxuries —may sell its
motor-car and do without petrol and lead the
simple life. Or, again, it may greatly reduce
its imports by building, say, 10,000 more
factories and making twice as many things
for itself as it now does. With a really
good tariff and some decentralisation this
looks much easier than a sufficient expansion
of the primary produce business. In any
case, the one thing needful is to make sure
that exports are worth some £30,000,000 per
annum more than imports, so that the sur-
plus will pay outside interest bills and leave
a trifle for repayments, and do this without
aggravated sweating and the leading of the
complete offal life —being the entire offaler,
so to speak. If this can be done under
Freetrade, then Freetrade is a good thing.
Unfortunately, the Freetraders who rush into
publicity never touch on this aspect of the
case, though it is the only aspect worth
calling an aspect.

Proposed Suspension of a Certificate.
A straw showing how the wind may yet
blow hard was lately floated by the Nation
and Athenaeum in London. It first of all
complained, as other papers did also, about
the scantiness of information concerning the
“works” in which some new Australian loans
(those of N. S. Wales among them) are in-
vested, and looking at even the financial
skeleton on page 52 of the last Federal Quar-
terly Statistics there seems to be room for
comment. This booklet puts the loan assets
of the six States under nine headings, but
they may be condensed under these two :
Railways, tramways, telegraphs, tele-
phones, water supply, etc., which
have more or less of a payable
look .. . £375,814,000
Harbors, rivers, roads, bridges, public
buildings,, idefqncfe, land repur-
chased for settlement and all other
investments, which lot looks un-
payable, bar the land for settle-
ment, and there heavy losses are
admitted .. .. .. .. 220,650’,000
Total State debts .. .. £596,464,000
“All other,” which lacks even a definite
name, stands for £69,760,000 of loan money,
and this wild, weird item has grown by
£15,000,000 in two years. Having got so
far the Nation and Atiienacum went a step
farther, and made a proposition which was
bound to come some time, from some source,
and which may proceed to spread. It sug-
gested that N. S. Wales loans (presumably
only new loans) should be struck off the list
of stocks in which trust funds may be in-
vested. The result would be much the same
as what happens to a skipper who has lost
his certificate or a solicitor who has wan-
dered off the roll. It would mean practically
the end of the great spending razzle, a big
difficulty in meeting the interest bill and
the payment of a disastrous price for re-
newals. N. S. Wales, which is picked out
for special condemnation, is far from having
the biggest debt per head or the worst col-
lection of assets, especially in the Land Re-
purchase and “All other” sections, but with
38 £ per cent, of the Commonwealth’s popula-
tion it owes 44 per cent, of the outside State
debts. That may possibly tell against it.
Then, like the Kipling cat which tramped
alone, it stands apart from the Loan Coun-
cil, and its new lOU’s lack the Common-
wealth’s endorsement. Said endorsement
only means that each of six States, all in
difficulties, guarantees itself and the other
five against their respective difficulties, but
the presumably superior moral and mental
quality of the Big Government counts for
something. Another element in the case_ is
that the Lang Ministry has been talking
loans on far too big a scale, while its foolish
rows with Governor De Chair, and its obvi-
ous pro-strike sympathies, tend to make its
Objective look perhaps Redder than it is.
With State debts multiplying as they are, it
is probably only the fact that they are trus-
tee stocks, and therefore wear a lialo of re-
spectability, which keep the new issues out
of the category of 7 per cent, bonds sold in
small quantities. The method of turning off
the halo seems simple enough. To quote
from a standard work of reference: —
The Colonial Stock Act, 1900, permits trustees,
both English and Scottish, to invest in certain
Colonial Stocks issued in the United Kingdom which
the Treasury publishes a list of in the London and
Edinburgh Gazettes.
Apparently a polite intimation to any State
that the Gazette is full so far as it is con-
cerned, and that there is no room in it for
another loan, would bring the business to a
standstill. Then it would probably be a
matter of undertaking to greatly reduce bor-
rowings, and to provide a solid and thief-
proof sinking fund, after which dealings
might resume on a diminished scale, and
under mild supervision. It would be equiva-
lent to holding an informal meeting of the
State’s creditors. Much loose discourse has
been spilled about shifting this country’s cus-
tom to New York, but New York is trying
to dispose, in Melbourne, of some of the few
Australian securities it already holds. A
great deal is said of Uncle’s eagerness to do
business, but he doesn’t rush the market
and buy existing stocks, so lie may be wait-
ing for better terms —perhaps much better
terms.

Railroads to Ruin.
Queensland staggers under the burden of
its union-dominated railways. The deficiency
last year (1924-25), after allowing for inter-
est on capital, was £894,498, whereas every
other State except little Tasmania showed
a surplus. Since the Labor Government
took charge in June, 1915. the capital cost
lias leaped from £37,638,727 to £54,862,572.
the annual interest bill from £1,531,317 to
£2,578,541, and working expenses from
£2,470,150 to £5,425,167. Even the hug.'
increase of revenue, due in the main to higher
rates, lias not kept pace with the prodigious
growth of expenditure. In the years before
Labor came in the net revenue (excess over
working expenses) went close to paying the
interest charges, and was rising steadily.
The Labor Government soon changed all
that. Compare the six years before and
after the advent of the Continuous Govern-
ment :

1920 .. . . 636,758
1921 . , . . 230,914
There could be no more striking commentary
on the way Labor runs the railways. Since
3921 the revenue has been rising rapidly
owing to increases in rates. Last year broke all
previous records —gross revenue, £7,109,210;
net revenue, £1,684,043. But even with a
record revenue Labor as Queensland knows
it cannot make the railways nay. The in-
terest charges swallowed up all the so-called
“net profit” on last year’s seven million
revenue and left a deficiency of £894,498.
With a revenue of £70,000,000 the result
would probably be much the same. Railway
Minister Larcombe puts forward the excuse
for his deficits that Queensland has the
largest railway system in the Commonwealth.
That is true enough as regards track mile-
age (Queensland has 6314 miles open for
traffic; N.S.W., 5656 miles; Victoria, 4484
miles; W.A., 3733 miles; 8.A., 2452 miles;
Tas., 673 miles). But Queensland had the
highest track mileage in Australia before
Labor came into power, and that did not
prevent Liberal Governments from showing
satisfactory results. The following table sets
out the position in which Labor found the
Queensland railways, and the position in
which it is leaving them: —

This comparison is more favorable to the
Continuous Government than it deserves, as
1925 was a record year for revenue. It
will be noted that the increase in train miles
run is comparatively small —only 77,951
miles. As the increase in working expenses is
£2,955,017, this works out at £37 a mile ! Nor
can McCormack and his party point to asound
railway system in justification of their enor-
mous expenditure. The permanent way is

notoriously unsafethe rolling stock is fall-
ing to pieces; the passenger coaches are old-
fashioned, dirty and uncomfortable; the ser-
vice is such as one must expect in a State

spend millions in repairing the permanent

first of all, no doubt, it will have to bear

Black and White.
“Feng-Sxiui” : Either “Bouragi” is politely
blind (B. 25/3/'26) to what goes on
around him or he has lived in some unusual
corners of the Empire. When he states that
“the native concubine as an institution has
never been accepted by British sentiment”
he speaks truth. But when he remarks that
“the most easy-going Briton in savage lands
has a contempt for the occasional maintainer
of a native concubine” he is generalising too
widely. When I was first stationed in a
Dutch colony where the bachelor white
planter regarded a concubine as a necessary
part of his equipment, like a sun-hat, I har-
bored “Bouragi’s” notions about British
colonies. I hadn’t been to one. Later I
went. It wasn’t to New Guinea, of which I
know next to nothing. A fellow-passenger in
the first saloon was a dusky Cleopatra loaded
with jewellery, whose Mark Antony came
aboard with the highest Government official
in the land. Instead of hiding his pretty
shame he introduced her round. She proved
to be a lady of character, and later I was to
experience the hospitality of her lord, over
which she presided with distinction. Her
ascendancy was locally ascribed to the obat
yuna (Malay for love potion) which she
was supposed to put in his food; but this
was probably a pious legend. In the settle-
ment to which I was addressed I found the
institution “Bouragi” speaks of not only
condoned but earnestly recommended by ail
old dwellers in the land. It was believed to
be a prophylactic against moral dry-rot, as
whisky in the local water was supposed to
be a safeguard against indigenous diseases.
The doctor said he was kept from going mad
by the ministrations of a Chinese nyahi:
the harbormaster’s linen was kept well
starched and his self-respect saved by a
geisha from Japan; and numbers of unmar-
ried _ planters solaced their loneliness with
specimens of the native races, from Tutungs
to Booloodoopies, without earning the visible
contempt of anyone, even the married wffrite
women. There was an exception, however.
Owing to an agitation got up long ago by
the London Spectator, the Government had
passed a regulation forbidding members of
the civil service from employing female in-
digenes. The practice was supposed to lower
their prestige amongst the native-born.
Whether it did or did not I am unable to
say; but the spectacle of an official frequent-
ing a haunt despised and dreaded by the
lowest coolie did not enhance the admin-
istration's reputation for commonsense.
“Bouragi” is nearer the truth when he says
that “alone among the great colonising
nations the British have turned the cold
shoulder on the idea of miscegenation”; but
it is the shoulder of hypocrisy all the same,
as the relative proportions of whites and
lialf-castes in the various colonies tend to
show. The Dutchman or the Portuguese,
although his attitude may be biologically un-
sound, at least does the fair thing by the
mixed bloods he brings into the world by
granting them all the rights and privilege's
of the white. The Englishman lets them
slip back into the native village, and then
asks “Bouragi” to tell the world that they
arrived by spontaneous generation. The
matter is of sufficient importance to merit
more than “Bouragi’s” conventional gesture
of repudiation. The young unmarried man
is sent into the waste places by self-righteous
Government departments and parsimonious
boards so poorly paid and miserably housed
that he is unable in decency to invite a white
bride to accompany him. Some firms even
went so far as to regard marriage for their
staffs before the attainment of a certain wage
as a criminal offence, and drummed out of
their service any members who clandestinely
broke the rule. The motive was economy,
married men and their families being expen-
sive things to shift about. The position has
improved since the war. Six hundred white
women may nowadays be seen sipping cock-
tails in Singapore where six would have
caused a riot in pre-war times; and “mar-
ried quarters” are a regular part of the oufit
ot many out-stations. Nevertheless, most of
the Empire's frontier burden is still carried
on the shoulders of the bachelor. Life for
him out there isn't as easy as it is for Mrs.
Mosman and the Rev. Yarra Park. He is
robbed and his digestion ruined by his male
servants, and the fun of darning his own
socks soon begins to lose its freshness. Until
the good people who stay at home realise
that their responsibilities go further than
ejaculations of shocked surprise, what is re-
garded as a vice in Marriekville will some-
how be transmuted into a virtue in Mar-
taban.
The Sepulchre of Dead Law.
There is a great body of English law which,
though it remains on the Statute 800k —it
being apparently nobody’s business to repeal
it is yet for all practical purposes as dead
as Caesar ; and this heritage passed to our
States, with the proviso that the laws Should
be applicable. It is queer stuff many of them
are made of. Technically, it is still an
offence—in England, at any rate—to eat
moat on a Wednesday or to go boating on
a Sunday. It is also punishable for anyone
in a public vehicle to hold in his, hand a
lighted pipe; if, however, the smoker keeps
it in his mouth he is apparently not an
offender. To absent oneself from church on
Sunday is punishable, the penalty being a
fine of one shilling, which must be paid in
copper coins. One must walk to church;
to go by any vehicle is forbidden, and no one
may attend a meeting on Sunday except in
his own parish. The clergy are dealt with
just as severely by the canon law. For in-
stance, an ecclesiastic must wear a plain
nightcap, not a fancy one; he may not wear
light-colored stockings, nor may he appear in
public without comely or scholarly apparel;
so every afternoon that the local curate plays
tennis he is flouting the law. How many of
these quaint rules of conduct could be main-
tained in Australia nobody knows; for indeed
the law is not so much an ass as a great
mystery. We used to be told that things
would be made plain and easy when Parlia-
ments were no longer over-run by lawyers;
but the promise has not been fulfilled —and
doesn’t seem likely to be.

“Gules” : Elliot Johnson, who claims he
is an artist but is remembered as an ex-
Speaker of the Federal Parliament who
PAWNS IN THE GAME.
“The A.L.P. Conference in Sydney has been a contest of wits among the faction leaders.”
once sat on an alligator, is out to reform
Australia’s coat-of-arms. Johnson says
the kangaroo and emu are "‘too realistic,”
and thinks the coat should “be more sym-
bolic and more in line with the more beau-
tiful, if conventional, heraldry.” The things
which Johnson doesn’t know much about
evidently include that ancient science and
art. The kangaroo and emu are not part
of the coat-of-arms. They are “supporters”
of it, a quite different thing. Also they are
entirely “in line” with the true heraldry,
wild animals, real and legendary, being com-
monly employed as supporters. Before me
is the coat of the S’African Union, with an
eland and hartebeest as supporters, and the
wildebeest in one of the quarters. The lion
and the unicorn of Britain are outstanding
examples. The suggestion that Bebtram
Mackennal should design a new coat is
on all fours with the objections to the old
one. The sculptor may be an authority on
heraldry, but the fact that he is a great
artist is no guarantee of it.

“Lex” : One of the periodical cases over the
ownership of a ticket that had drawn a fat
P™ ir m n a Tatt.’s sween came before the
JN.b.NV. Supreme Court the other day ; among
other things it was unsuccessfully argued
for the defendant—an unchivalrous person
who was trying to deprive a lady co-investor
of her whack—that the whole business was
illegal, and that therefore no action would
lie with regard to any agreement made about
it. His Honor ruled, however, that it was
perfectly legal for two or more persons resi-
dent in N.S.W. to agree that they would
apply to a person in Tasmania for tickets
in a lottery which must be presumed to be
legal in that State. Which provokes a mild
wonder if the same view would be taken
by a Federal Judge. The,Ma State sees
nothing illegal in a lottery sanctioned by
Jaw in the Speck, but it might be contended
before a Commonwealth Court that the
Commonwealth regards Tatt.’s with such
abhorrence that it refuses to carry letters
thereto by the ordinary channel, and there-
fore its Judges could hardly be expected to
regard investments therein as legitimate and
to sort out the rights and w T rongs of a
squabble between two investors over the
ownership of a winning ticket. Possibly the
opinion of the Federal High Court on the
legality or otherwise of Tatt.’s will not be
discovered till its services are invoked by a
Commonwealth citizen who is without a
State of his own—somebody at Canberra,
for instance.
From the stroke of midnight on December
31 last the cow-farmers of the Common-
wealth joined in a solemn league and cov-
enant to tax themselves to the extent of a
penny-halfpenny on every pound of butter
produced in order to pay a bonus of 3d. a
pound on butter exported. The decision has
had rather surprising results. As a matter
of arithmetic it was calculated to raise the
price of local supplies by 14s. a cwt.; as a
matter of business it was expected to bump
the price up by 28s. a cwt., the amount of
the export bonus; as a matter of fact the
local price, in Sydney, has risen by 375. 4d.
a cwt., with a somewhat steeper ascent in
Melbourne, and the Sydney price is at present
about 12s. a cwt. higher than the London
price, though it costs about 255. a cwt. to
ship to London. It is thus computed that
at present prices the people of the Com-
monwealth are paying, £2,000,000 a year
more for their butter than they did last year,
ostensibly in order to secure benefit to the
extent of about £750,000 a year on the ex-
port market. The cow-farmer, of course,
is a very important bone in the country’s
vertebrae and is entitled to more than he has
sometimes got in the past; but he isn’t
politically strong enough to fasten such an
arrangement permanently upon the backs
of his fellow-countrymen. It is emphatically
one of those cases where enthusiasm ought to
be tempered by discretion.
\ ICTORIA may end by solving its war-
memorial problem as London did. London
began by pottering round with a big project;
and then a cenotaph was hastily erected as a
temporary tribute. But the design of Sir
Edward Lutyens so gratified the English
imagination that the simple emblem was
allowed to remain, and will probably always
remain. Melbourne is to have a temporary
cenotaph ready for Anzae Day in front of
Federal Parliament House. If this is
eventually replaced by something similar in
permanent materials it may supplant the
scheme for the expensive memorial on St.
Kilda-road which has failed to stir public
enthusiasm.

“Si Anu’’ (Singapore): The construction
of Australia’s first line of defence is at last
fairly on the way. Seletar, whiqh a year
ago was a mangrove-swamp where a few r
Malay fishermen fought an apathetic battle
with the anopheles mosquito, is now a busy
town. Huge concrete piles to carry the
wharves are sticking up out of the sea, and
the railway which is to connect the base with
the main line at Woodlands is begun. The
life-blood of the future fleet that will be
quartered there is present in 70 enormous
oil-tanks, which were started in 1922, before
the Labor-Government interlude in Britain.
The beginning of operations synchronised
with the sudden jump in rubber prices and
the removal of the restrictions on production.
Bitter outcries against the naval base went
up from rubber-planters unable to obtain
sufficient labor to tap their trees. This has
been got over, however, and as the work
proceeds the base will transport its own
man-power from India and China. Inci-
dentally, Malaya is crowing over the record
year in its history: it came after a period
of woeful depression, when hundreds of
planters were going through that very par-
ticular hell of the white man in black-labor
countries, unemployment. To-day the planter
is ordering his Rolls-Royces again, and agents
for every kind of luxury are springing up in
Singapore. Some idea of the magnitude of
the trade for which the naval base is an
insurance policy can be gauged by the com-
parative figures for 1919 and 1925. The
tonnage of vessels entering and clearing the
port has increased in the six years from
nearly four million tons to over seven mil-
lions. _ The total trade for all Malaya, most
of which passes through Singapore, went up
from 200 million pounds to nearly 300 mil-
lions. The through-trade with the farther
Orient is enormous. No wonder John Bull
regards the little group of islands Raffles
annexed in 1819 as worth his attention. Even
without the Australian trade, the base would
have justified itself in his eyes.

Melboubne is getting nervous over the state
of its traffic, especially where it flows in and
out _of the Flinders-street station. This
station, with its two entrances, is now the
busiest railway depot in the Empire, Liver-
pool-street, London, having recently investi-
gated the figures and handed the palm to
Mr. Clapp. A quarter of a million people
tramp to and fro across the Flinders-Swan-
ston intersection daily, and through this mob
the motor traffic weaves its way. As all
these people have to plunge under the earth
to reach their trains, they might as well do
the plunging on the city side of the cross-
roads. A subway is plainly called for. An-
other bridge spanning the network of sub-
urban railways and the Yarra is also asking
to be built. These measures, even if the
Government makes up its mind about them
in the lifetime of this generation, will take
years to carry out. The best measure of
all, decentralisation, isn't likely to even get
consideration.

One of the patrol-cars which roam Mel-
bourne with an ear attuned to the ether got
a wireless message the other night to say
that a burglar at that moment was entering
a house in another suburb. A few minutes
later the car intercepted a man leaving the
locality on a push-bike. The celerity with
which this coup and others have been car-
ried out suggests that if the wireless and the
petrol-waggon were more Used by Melbourne
police the push nuisance would be speedily
flattened out. A dozen cars connected day
and night with the various suburban stations
by wireless would help to keep the peace
far more effectually than the closing of pubs
on Saturday afternoons, which is Commis-
sioner Blamey’s proposed solution.
“Rex” : I contest the statement (B.
4/2/’26) that Queensland leads the other
States in the control of commission-agents.
Auctioneers, as distinguished from estate-
agents, have for many years had to hold
licenses in Victoria, although they were not
required to give any security for the privi-
lege of handling their clients’ moneys. At
the same time as Queensland passed its Auc-
tioneers and Commission Agents Act, 1922,
Victoria tightened up its control of land-
agents by passing the Real Estate Agents
Act, which is on the same lines as the
Queensland Act. This requires all kinds
of land salesmen to obtain a license from a
court of petty sessions, and to enter into a
fidelity bond of £250. The amount is, of
course, inadequate; still, if the agent de-
faults, the victims get something from the
wreck. The license must be renewed yearly,
and any aggrieved person may object to an
assembled Bench of J’s.P. that the appli-
cant is unfit to hold a license. The Vic.
Act goes further than the Queensland
legislation in some respects, as, in addition
to delieensing land-agents for misappropriat-
ing trust funds, it empowers any court of
justice to suspend or cancel the license
of any agent who has been guilty of
fraud. But Vic. misses the worst abuse
of estate-agents, i.e., their charges. These
are left to themselves to fix, and
what they grab out of a sale is termed
‘the percentage fixed by custom.” If law-
yers were allowed to tax their bills of costs
on a scale fixed by themselves, instead of
having to submit them to a taxing-master,
the howds of litigants would be deafening,
yet almost daily solicitors encounter cases
of land-agents helping themselves to a few
hundred pounds of commission for a few
hours’ gassing, while the law'yer gets only a
couple of guineas for the laborious work of
preparing the documents and title deeds.


Your Personal Responsibility.
Do you bring to your personal affairs the same careful thought that you give
to your own or your employer’s business?
One of your main business principles is to save money where possible, and to
spend wisely when spend you must. Is your own personal income so great that
you can afford to be less careful in saving, less wise in the spending of it?
Practically every man has family or other responsibility, and knows the need
for economy.

POLITICAL
POINTS
to re-admit Boss Bailey. Every faction at
the conference (there were four, not count-
ing the politicians) professes to have gained
a victory, moral or otherwise, but there are
all the materials for a first-class explosion
in the alleged party.
Some interesting revelations as to the
voting methods of “comrades” w’ere made
at the Sydney A.L.P. Conference. The
returning-officer referred to their predilec-
tion for going into the voting booths in
pairs and comparing their “tickets” in spite
of his efforts to prevent them. Then O’Reilly,
whose faction had been thrown overboard
to make room for the last-minute amalgama-
tion of the A.W.U. and its mortal foes,
explained that the first man into each booth
only pretended to vote, and took his blank
paper out to be marked by the heads, thus
avoiding interference with the amalgamation
ticket. The next man in put this marked
ballot-paper in the box, and, in his turn,
brought out his blank ballot to be “fixed.”
The ingenious idea is said to hail from
America, and certainly smells of it as well
as of trusting mateship.
Because a few of the tram-men are obliged
to walk half a mile for lunch, Melbourne has
been experiencing the humors and .exas-
perations of a “lazy” strike. Conductors
showed a touching solicitude for the safety
of elderly ladies, and drivers stopped in the
middle of intersections to warn pedestrians
off the track furlongs away. All this in
spite of the knowledge that, the Tramways
Board having refused the men’s request for
pay for the five minutes each way occupied
by the lunchers, the dispute was to be re-
ferred to the Arbitration Court. The union
is presumably indulging in its lazy or crazy
tactics to show its solidarity.
Tasmanian Railway Commissioner Mis-
camble suggests that the Commonwealth
should help the island out by taking over
its railways and main roads. Compared with
taking over the debt owing abroad (with a
pledge that Tasmania should incur no more
foreign debt), this is unsatisfactory. It
The peevish Lang’s daily but unconvincing
defence against real or imaginary calumny
is wearisome. The other day he put on
his armor and slew the decomposed dragon
all over again, thus: —
Mr. Lang quoted plank 1 of the Labor platform as
follows: “Abolition of the Legislative Council, and
the substitution therefor of the initiative, referendum
and recall.” “Can anyone tell me,” he asked, “how
I could substitute anything for the Legislative Council
until it was out of the way ?”
Quite so. And can anyone tell Mr. Lang
how the Railway Commissioners substituted
the Sydney Central Station for the old Red-
fern terminus without first destroying the
old terminus, and leaving the trains out in
the wet on the bare ground while the new
structure was going up? Further, can any-
one say how Lang himself substitutes new
clothes for old unless he first burns the old
outfit and then goes forth, just as he was
born, to order something fresh?
The Queensland Labor policy was ex-
pounded at Cairns by a spectacled and per-
spiring Premier in 12,000 words. It is cal-
culated that, if the electors accept the
policy, there will be a loan expenditure of
£lOOO for every word. Three millions for
workers’ homes, £2,500,000 for railway roll-
ing-stock, £2,000,000 for advances to settlers,
increased workers’ compensation, widows’
pensions, a child-endowment scheme and an-
other halfpenny a pound for the cotton-
grower are some of the things promised ; but
the list stretches to the crack of doom —
every elector is to have something, the tax-
paying minority excepted. McCormack claimed
that his Government’s accumulated deficit
was a bagatelle compared with those of N. S.
Wales, Westralia, S. Ans." and Tasmania
(all now Labor) —a mere £612,376. He
didn’t mention Nat.-Coclcy Victoria, nor in
all the 12,000 words did he state what his
crowd had added to the public debt.
The A.W.U. is wondering whether its
effort at the Sydney Labor Donnybrook was
worth while. Having for two years de-
nounced the Tyrrell-Magrath gang control-
ling the A.L.P. executive as infamous (“an
insanitary oligarchy” was the Worker’s
latest expression) it allied itself with the
Reds of the Trades and Labor Council to
force Magratli and Tyrrell off the new T execu-
tive. Having done that, it joined forces with
the Tyrrell-Magraths (who had described it
as being inspired and controlled by a Tam-
many boss expelled for life on a ballot-
faking charge) to dish the Reds. That also
was accomplished, but the A.W.U. paid the
penalty of its Machiavellian policy. Buck-
land, its nominee for the presidency, was
beaten by Seale, a Magrath-Tyrrell man. It
was defeated for a minority of positions on
the incoming executive. Worst of all, the
conference, at the instance of the grinning
Magrath, instructed the new executive not

“Australia’s Customs revenue was £29,910,000 for the first nine months of the current fiscal year. The Minister for

“Go on, paste it up, 'Opeful ’Erbert!”
would make the State a permanent infant or
ward in Chancery, and life would resolve
itself into one long complaint about neglect
and dilapidation, and one long begging expe-
dition to the foot of the Federal throne. It
isn’t certain that the relief would be suffi-
cient, either.
Says Lang, of N. S. Wales: —
I definitely promised, when the Abolition Bill
was before Parliament, that I would introduce the
initiative, referendum and recall as soon as the
Abolition Bill was passed, and the necessary gap
created.
Very many people are unable to remember
that promise: but even if the promise was
a solid thing the community had a right to
expect a preliminary view of the goods. The
initiative might be subject to the consent of
Parliament. The referendum might require
a five-sixths majority. The recall might
operate only on the sixth Friday of the
month. When anybody is asked to swap
one horse for another, it is customary to
show the other horse—in fact, for the animals
to be present simultaneously at the transac-
tion. This does more than show that the
other horse is worth something; it shows that
there is another horse.
Opposition-leader Moore’s accusation that
the Queensland Government was saving up
loan money for an orgy of expenditure just
before the election is being borne out.
Loan expenditure on public works, which
amounted to £261,450 in January and
£303,500 in February, jumped to £771,507
in March. Moore predicts that the April
total will be over a million. But there is
sure to be a slump in May—the election is
on the 9th.
The Leg. Council will be restored in
Queensland if the Opposition wins the elec-
tions, but it w’on’t be the old nominee
chamber. Opposition-leader Moore proposes
a House of 30 members, elected for six years,
half to retire every three years. The fran-
chise is to be the same as for the Assembly,
and the State will be divided into five pro-
vinces, each returning six members. Moore
has wisely taken the Commonwealth Senate
as his model in preference to the complicated
schemes put forward in N. S. Wales. Inci-
dentally, lie promises a redistribution of
seats and the unification of State and Fed-
eral rolls.
Unless the N.S.W. Labor Government can
bluff or bully Governor de Chair into
appointing another lot of nominee legislators
it will henceforth be in a hopeless position
as regards the Leg. Council. With the 25
added last year, after his Ex.’s leg had been
outrageously pulled, it reckoned itself sure
of 52 members in a House of 99. Since
then Laborites Bryant and Percival have
been expelled by the A.L.P. executive for
voting against the Abolition Bill; a third,
Hordern, has died (as also has the New-
castle Nationalist, Brown), and five more,
all of the December vintage—Akhurst, Kelly,
Lyons, Smith and Murray—have been shot
out by the Labor conference for not being
on hand when the abolition vote was taken.
The firing-out of the five is acclaimed “a
great personal victory for Mr. Lang.”
Whether it is really a victory or a blunder
whereby a fatheaded Government has re-
duced itself to impotence will be shown in
due season.
In a doubtful mood the U.S. Senate lias
appointed a committee to find out if prohi-
bition is what it is said to be. In Chicago,
where there is one murder per day,
Anton Cermak, president of the Board of Com-
missioners, declared that alcoholic patients had in-
creased enormously in the hospitals. It was the
same with insane alcoholic cases. Chicago was now
building a new and larger gaol, while the Commis-
sioners’ appropriation for poverty and pauperism
had been greatly augmented. There had been a
steady increase in the number of the Chicago police,
but crime still increased.
Mr. George Brennan, a Democratic political leader,
testified that the law had increased drunkenness,
immorality, disrespect, corruption, murder, insanity,
blindness and crime in general.
It seems to have promoted everything except
unpunctuality and procrastination. Even
“Pussyfoot” Johnson announces that he com-
mitted various crimes in the good cause, but
insists that for his part he drew the line
at murder.
The Vic. P.L.C. at its Easter conference de-
cided to abandon the party's redistribution
plan of 10 metropolitan and 10 country triple
seats, with proportional voting, in favor of
30 country and 30 metropolitan single seats,
preferential voting being retained. Rather
than accept the 24 city seats —an increase of
three —offered by the Allan-Peacock Govern-
ment, McPherson, Greenwood and other Min-
isterial malcontents might vote for Labor's
proposal, but they would probably like to
know first whether they would also be voting
for a dissolution and a postponement of re-
distribution for three years. On paper, the
Labor redistribution scheme is not calculated
to gain seats for its authors, but if the
Whigs could be divided and conquered
through its instrumentality it could, of course,
be dropped.
The Moama (Vic.) to Balranald (N.S.W.)
railway, which will serve an area of nearly
two -million acres between the Lachlan and
the Murray, has been declared open for busi-
ness for the full 120 miles or thereabouts.
State rights (which are often citizens’
wrongs) delayed its construction for a
quarter of a century. The territory is about
twice as far from Sydney as it is from
Melbourne, so Sydney took the view that
the land was no good. Yet the line, though
it has been opened only in part for a few
months, has already helped to drag 21,820
tons of goods and 182,610 head of cattle.
Before Judge Moulc in Victoria six juries
lately disagreed in about as many days.
Acquittal was presumably impossible, even
for the usual type of soft-hearted jury, but
there was always at least the one man re-
quired to make conviction impossible—six
stumbling-blocks in all. With the jury of
15 and the majority verdict, it is necessary
to make sure of 48 jurymen to make six
convictions impossible in the face of the
evidence, and to get so many would be a
Herculean task. And if the 48 were secured
the result would be six acquittals instead of
six disagreements, and the matters would at
least be finished.
The intrigues at the A.L.P. Conference
in Sydney have curious side-issues. Lang,
facing an audience likely to be hostile, turned
it to enthusiasm by sledge-hammering the
Upper House and dramatically demanding
that the five Labor
nominees who failed
to vote for aboli-
tion should be ex-
pelled. The cheers
sounded life a vic-
tory, but the ges-
ture that evoked
them raised fresh
hands against the
unhappy Premier.
Murray, M.L.C., is
a cobber of Fitz-
gerald, the Minis-
ter for Local Gov-
ernment ; and an-
other of the named
five, iCarl Akhurst,
who was a clerk in
the Worker office
with Tom Mutch,
is so much a pal
that, when Tom
first became Minis-
ter for Education,
he found a place
for Carlms his pri-
vate secretary.
The Vic. Labor
party ranged itself
alongside certain
ecclesiastical bodies
and other vested
interests when it
considered a motion
that at least three
women should bo
elected to the an-
nu a 1 conference,
place for them to
be found by the
retirement of three
male members who
had been longest in
continuous service.
The conference
threw the resolu-
tion out as if it
had be.en something
to do with the referendum and recall.
A pair of engineering experts from the
United States, imported to advise the Vic
Government, were lunched recently in Mel-
bourne, and one of them made remarks about
the higher education. The U.S., he said,
has about 700 universities and 750,000
students—roughly, one student to each 120
inhabitants. Australia has six universities
for a similar area, and 8086 students, or one
to 703 inhabitants; and 751 of the students
study music only. Australia hasn’t founded
a new university for 13 years, and apparently
doesn’t intend to. If it were cut into, say.
15 States with as many capitals, there would
presumably be 15 universities, and then know-
ledge would begin to spread; but the rule
that nothing must grow or prosper outside
each big State’s Big City causes seats of
learning to be very far apart. There is no
country which speaks English and isn’t
frozen where it is possible for a youth to be
half so remote from knowledge.
BEYOND THE PALE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Socially and politically, I have always regarded
and treated our opponents as implacable enemies.”
N.S.W. Premier Lang to the State Labor Conference.
Odi profanum vulgus, Horace sang,
Loathing the common herd ; and let me state
Just as explicitly I, Johnny Lang,
Regard with fierce contempt and bitter hate
Each one and all of those who disagree
In politics and Parliament with me.
Et arceo, added the Roman coot,
Conveying unmistakably thereby
He wouldn’t touch, even with a forty-foot
Pole, his aversions—and no more will I.
Meet them I must in controversy’s strife;
But mingle with them! —No, not on your life!
I shun all gatherings where I might meet
Guests who are canaille from my point of view;
To sit with chaps like these and drink or eat
Is something I should be ashamed to do.
The liver wing would choke me, and the wine
Send shudders down my democratic spine.
Let weak-kneed legislators gush and bray
Of sweet’ning public life and suchlike guff ;
I find that just to pass the time of day
With Nationalist blokes is trial enough.
Glumly I do it, with averted head,
Like one who gets a whiff of something dead.
No truck wiHi them in leisure hours I’ll hold;
To me, howe’er it grate upon them, they’ll
Continue pariahs outside the fold
And undesirables beyond the pale.
Even in death let no-one have the heart
To bury us less than a mile apart.

A.M.P. directors are once more hearing plain
talk from the family circle. All that really
matters centres in “the bonus fetich.” The
points taken are that the mortality tables
used are out of date, the death-rate being
about half that on which the society bases
its premiums; that the estimated earning-
power of funds (3 p.c.) is too low in view
of the actual earnings over many years;
that the loading for expenses is too high.
In brief, that the premium rates are exces-
sive, and that the remarkable bonuses are
merely refunds of overcharges. That sum-
marises the criticism. The conclusion arrived
at—that the premium rates should be brought
more into conformity with necessities —must
be weighed up with several factors in view.
Obviously the premiums could be lowered:
the fact that such substantial bonuses are
paid by the mutual societies is good enough
proof of that. (Incidentally, this is one of
the things which make it possible for young
cos. to struggle on beyond the first couple
of years—for they charge about the full
rate, and do not hand back bonuses as the
established offices do.) But for one office
alone to reduce premiums would place it at
a disadvantage, in that the principal selling
talk is bonuses. There is more even than
that in it, though. The mortality tables
might suffer revision; the loading for ex-
penses be brought to accord more with recent
experience; the estimated earning capacity
of funds lifted nearer to the actual results;
but outstanding is the fact that these over-
estimates make for safety. It is not ordi-
nary contingencies only that have to be
guarded against; catastrophes may shake a
country to its foundations. Australia has
had one bitter experience of financial wreck-
age, and although the factors which made
for the trouble in the ’nineties are not likely
to be duplicated, other combinations of cir-
cumstances may work to the same end. Life-
insurance concerns —mutual or proprietary—
act as trustees ; and “Security above all” must
he their motto. The money placed in their
keeping represents the wise man’s provision
for old age or against the time when death
will remove him and leave his dependants
without a bread-winner. There is no respon-
sibility so onerous.
Conservatism generally walks with age,
while youth goes hand in hand with enter-
prise. But here is conservatism with no
sign of senility. Enterprise may not be con-
spicuous, but at least there is vigor suffi-
cient to lift the society from record to re-
cord. Income last year in the Ordinai’y
department was more than £400,000 greater
than the previous year’s, and £3,000,000-odd
was added to funds. It takes more than
the momentum of reputation to register those
figures. And the progress is no less marked
in the outposts than at headquarters. Inci-
dentally, the business is now distributed as
follows:

Actuary Elliott again had the pleasure
of reporting a record amount avail-
able for distribution among holders of par-
ticipating policies. And the office again
passed on the information clothed in the
phraseology of previous years :—-
The amount, £2,403,694, is the largest sum ever
distributed as cash bonuses for a single year, and
represents 54.5 p.c. of the premiums received during
the year on participating policies.
So it was the year before and the year be-
fore that and further back:—
1888-1893.. 40.3 p.c. 1918.. .. 32.6 p.c.

1916 .. 30.1 „ 1925.. .. 54.5 „
1917 . . 18.6 „
The amount will provide reversionary addi-
tions of approximately £4,150,000, and most
of it will go in that direction. Of the last
distribution only £123,689 was taken in cash
—less than Is. 2d. in the £l.
Most insurance figures are bigger these
days. They need to be, for £lOO to-day isn’t
worth what it was 10 to 15 years ago. The
same influences affect the amount of insur-
ance carried by the individual, and this has
helped the established cos. with their new-
business. costs. Estimating new business to
be 10 times more expensive than old, last
year’s exes, were 83 and 8.3 p.c. respectively.
On the other method that 7 p.c. on renewal
premiums is a fair charge for old business,
the balance of exes, being charged against
new business, we get the figures in the last
column of the following table:—

The reduction in costs was trifling, but it
represents the fourth consecutive cut, which
is important. It is possible that that reflects
the lessening influence of new cos., most of
which were floated in 1920. There can be
little doubt that the publicity which life in-
surance has received ultimately benefits the
older offices. If the rate of expansion is
maintained, and costs can be kept in hand
or reduced, total income should pass the eight-
millions mark in 1927. Costs compared also
with total income are moving the right way:

Better than the expansion in business was the
further reduction in the expense rate. This has
been consistent: 25.0 p.c. last year • i 024
26.6; 1023, 26.8 ; 1022. 28.6; and 1021. 30.5

year was £155,348. of which £150.000 is to
be distributed, providing reversionary bonuses
of about £212,000.
At December 31, assets totalled £61,087,261,

“The figures point to the fact that your so-
ciety has turned the corner, and from now
on should be self-supporting,” says the re-
port. But there is a great deal of the capital
unrepresented by visible assets £73,948
compared with £71,953 at the preceding bal-
ance. Certainly that is the best year’s per-
formance yet: £1995 to the bad compared
with a net £8073 in 1924 and £15,714 in
1923. And even when the co. has brought
outgo below income it will still have serious
matters to attend to. There is, for instance,
the debit balance, which culls for drastic
reduction ; there is the necessity of setting
aside sums to provide funds for claims which
will increase with each year of the co.’s
existence; the matter of policy-holders’
bonuses will also call for attention. Beyond
all those lie the claims of shareholders.
The co. has completed its fifth year, and
the actuarial examination is in progress to
ascertain the amount of liability which has
accrued under policies. The amount of capi-
tal intact at December 31—-£6o,7s4 —was
doubtless much more than adequate to cover
the liability. There is, in addition, the un-
called capital—of the total of £134,702 only
the 5000 shares issued to the promoter are
fully paid, the balance being represented by
177,122 contribs.—but the £47,420 callable
has to be considered alongside the share
forfeitures of the past two years. Incident-
ally, a considerable number of shares were
sold last year at a premium. Less than half
the co.’s capital is represented by tangible
assets, and the amount has to bear deduc-
tion for policy liabilities. The “Wild Cat”
wonders whether the share-sellers stressed
those facts.
The co. certainly improved considerably
over previous years in the matter of busi-
ness:—
Policies. Assuring. Premium.
1921 .. 3,142 £199,070 £7,470
1922 . . 10,854 1,000,671 31,556

1924 .. 12,120 1,151,039 52,028
1925 . . 17,307 1,527,714 64,450
In the four years to 1924 annual premiums
on policies written aggregated £133,532. Last
year’s business represented annual premiums
of £64.450, and yet the total premium income
for 1925 was only £70,106. Claims in the
period have totalled £8968, so it is evident
that an over-large percentage of the business
does not stick beyond the first year. The
fact that a fair proportion of the business
is Industrial, in which the early lapses gener-
ally are less than in Ordinary, does not
improve the position. (Separate figures for
the two branches are not given, premium in-
come being stated in the one entry.) Last
year's record of forfeitures and lapses
appears to have been a little better than
some, but before it can do any good the co.
will need to hold on to a much greater
volume of the policies taken up. It is suf-
ficiently an evil and a waste to lose business
cheaply obtained, but when it costs from
225. to 30s. to write 20s. worth of business
and it lapses at the end of the first year, the
net result is the disappearance of some of
the co.’s capital even if no claims have to be
met.
Expenses were curbed last year, but much
more will have to be done. The grouping of
both classes of business makes an estimate
of the cost rate for Ordinary impossible; but
the all-in cost was 105 p.c. compared with
118 p.c. for 1924 and 150 p.c. for 1923. Most
of the expenditure items look as if they
would respond to a determined attack with
an axe. The accounts are frank: all costs
are charged against revenue. At December
31 tangible assets amounted to £63,527, in-
cluding public securities £29.660; cash
£9928 ; loans on mortgages and policies £9498.
Motor-cars, furniture and stationery
amount to £Bsoo—heavy for a young co.
and poor stuff in a balance-sheet. Liabili-
ties (exclusive of policy liabilities) totalled
£2773. During the year an insurance scheme
was purchased for £229; it appears in the
assets as “endowment fund.”

Brisbane City Council has agreed to nego-
tiate with the co. for the purchase of its
undertaking, and in consideration therefor
the co. has extended the time within which
the Council may take over the South Bris-
bane area (which ordinarily wonld have ex-
pired at the end of the present year) for
six months. This is the culmination of a
series of offers and counter-offers which have
kept Brisbane talking for more than a year.
It does not necessarily follow that the nego-
tiations will end successfully; for there are
some wide divergences of opinion to be recon-
ciled. Nevertheless, the latest development
is a promising start. Just prior to the armis-
tice Brisbane City Council had called for
tenders for a generating plant, to be ready
to supply power by January next. The
Council took the stand that increasing power
demanded by the Tramway Trust and from
areas within the Greater Brisbane boun-
daries at present uncovered should be served
by a municipally-owned and -controlled
plant with a view ultimately (as the City'
Electric’s franchise fell in) of supplying the
whole of the requirements of Greater Bris-
bane. The Council offered the co. £1,500,000
for all assets except cash on fixed deposit.
The co.’s reply was a pained statement that
its working plant alone was worth £1,700,000
and a submission of the following counter-
offers (in each case cash, investments and
book debts being excluded) :
(1) The Council to agree now to purchase the
undertaking at Dec. 31, 1933, tor £1,750,000; cash
or bonds. The latter to have a 15 years’ currency,
carry interest at 6 p.c. p.a. and the backing of the
Queensland Government. Capital expenditure from
March 1, 1926, to Dec. 31, 1933, less depreciation
at If p.c. p.a., to be added to the purchase price. Or
(2) The Council to purchase the undertaking for
£2,500,000 payable July 31, 1926; cash or bonds as
in first offer. The co. to carry on the business
from March 1 to date of payment on terms to be
arranged. Additions or permanent improvements in
plant to be added to the purchase price. Or
(3) The co. to surrender its undertaking to the
Council on Dec. 31, 1952, without compensation for
loss of profits, goodwill or plant as existing at March
1, 1926. Meantime the co. to carry on its business
in present areas, including supply for tramway
traction and the Council’s lighting business.
Immediate purchase, if at all, is the better
method; and that will involve arbitration.
The co. claims that its contracts and fran-
chises —running to 1945 —are valuable apart
from the physical assets. Obviously there
would be, under ordinary circumstances, a
tidy lump of goodwill in a proposition which
has paid good divs. and accumulated fair
reserves; but the council is not willing to
admit that goodwill in this case can be
valued by ordinary standards, inasmuch as
the Council has the legal right, and no
doubt can get the capital, to sell current
anywhere within the municipality. The co.,
however, lias some strong moral rights; such
rights were frankly recognised when 20 years
or so ago the Sydney City Council proceeded
to establish a light and power department
and bought out the Strand, Empire and other
cos., even though their equipment was of little
value to the municipal enterprise. A' strong
and sincere effort should certainly be made
to avoid the economic waste that would be
involved in the unnecessary duplication of
plant, mains, etc.
The co.’s profit for last year, while it
indicates the value of the business, on the
other hand furnishes, a strong argument to
the advocates of municipalisation. After
providing for prefs. it was equal to 17 p.c.
on ordinaries or 14 p.c. on average funds.
Reserves expanded to £298,296, but the good-
will item “Purchase account, £62,728” re-
duces that to £235,573. This comparison of
balance-sheet figures over two five-yearly
terms shows how rapidly the co. has pro-
gressed :—•

Engineers agree that wood is practically inde-

the reasons why Pioneer Wood Pipe, which is in con-
stant use, proves so wonderfully efficient. As well
as being unusually lasting, it is proof against de-
structive influences such as encrustations, organic
growths, rust, electrolysis or frost. When these
advantages are considered in conjunction with its low
initial cost, economical transportation and installa-
tion expenses, it will be readily understood that it
merits serious consideration from all interested in
the provision of lasting conduit service. Australian

The latest accounts show net tangibles equal
to 245. for each £1 of capital. Incidentally,
the disturbance has elicited the. fact that
prefs. rank with ords. equally in the dis-
tribution of assets only after the deduction
of reserved profits, which are considered the
exclusive property of ordinaries.

come to anything at the annual meeting on
Mouday. He spoke, and challenged, and
moved a vote of no confidence. But he could
muster only 8910 votes representing 112,25*
shares, whereas 25,246 votes representing
905,953 shares were lodged for I rank llam-
bridge, who was the nominee of the existing
Board. Corbould was, of course, re-elected,
although Bedford opposed him also—it might
have been better tactics not to have done
so. If the old Prop, shareholders feel
strongly that they should have a represen-
tative on the Board, it is plain that they will
have to seek from their number a man of
similar qualifications to those possessed by
Ilambridge. But by the time the next elec-
tion comes round the divisions between the
two sections will probably have disappeared.
At the meeting chairman Mcßae reviewed
the position of the field in the usual terms.
To deal 'with the carbonates —Mt. Isa won t
need to bother about the sulphides for some
time —an experimental plant is to be laid
down at a cost of £lO,OOO to test a patented
process of Corbonld’s. A process developed
by M. O. Tain ton, an American, is looked
upon as a second string if Corbould’s labo-
ratory results are not confirmed by opera-
tions on a working scale.

On the Duckmaloi, eight miles from Oberon
(N.S.W.), a bismuth show of 19 acres may
be exploited if the public will subscribe the
necessary capital. Metallic bismuth is worth
7s. a lb. The prospectus speaks of £17,500
in 70,000 ss. shares, of which, however, 28,000
paids go to the vendors, leaving 42,000 con-
tribs with only 6d. liability, after allotment.
Work on the lease has been confined to adits
and short drives. Systematic development
has not been attempted, the prospectors hav-
ing just followed the enrichments. The
high-grade stuff goes from 2 to 3 p.c., and
manager Jack Libby reckons. \ p.c. will pay
well, adding that he is certain of that aver-
age across the big friable lode. of easily-
treated stuff. Percival Wilson estimates that
above 100 ft. there is 180,000 tons of i p.c.
stuff, with a rise in grade to l p.c. by selec-
tive mining. A leaching plant for crushing
and delivery straight to the vats is proposed.
Alan Davis is handling the float.
Shares in Queensland tin ventures have
lately been on offer in Perth (W.A.), but
few have been unloaded. Westralia has
several shows of its own worth development,
but capital is shy. A syndicate at Green-
bushes is being assisted by the Government
to open up a big lode formation • but values
there are patchy, and success is doubtful.
There are better tin deposits to be had for
pegging on the n.-w. Pilbara field, but the
inaccessibility and want of water prevent
activity. To make matters worse transport
costs are mountainous, and foodstuff prices
are at dizzy heights. #
Prospectors are treated very well in West-
ralia. A State board is always ready to give
assistance in the shape of sustenance, equip-
ment, fares, etc., and advisory bodies at vari-
ous mining centres point out the most likely
spots to try. Last year 166 parties, repre-
senting 266 men, were helped in this way at
a cost of, roughly, £6OOO. Several assisted
prospectors found gold, and one or two dis-
covered fields which are producing in a
small way. Nothing big, however, was un-
earthed. One party sent to the Far North
in search of minerals and another which
headed towards Warburton Ranges to look
for gold turned back, the first owing to dis-
agreements among members, the second be-
cause the native guides deserted.
Canadian papers continue to whoop about
the visible and hidden wealth of Associated’s
Ontario interests —Vipond gold- and Keeley
silver-mines. For the first two months of
this year Vipond’s output was worth 92 000
dollars, and returns are tipped to be double
this when mill additions are completed in
May. Keeley’s yield for the same period
was valued at between 150,000 and 200,000
dollars. The latter’s liquid assets in August
last were valued at over 1J million dollars,
and its prosperous life was then declared to
have only just begun. But, as silver-mines
are worked nowadays, shareholders must not
expect such prosperity to go on indefinitely.

Directors of Devon (W.A. ) have managed
to raise a further £5862 by the sale of 23.450
unissued shares, and have made a call (the
71st) of 3d. which is expected to provide an
additional £5BO or thereabouts. Some of this
money is to be used on the equipment which
the late manager described as obsolete and
mostly disabled, and the balance is to be spent
on development. As usual, word is being
passed round that previous failures were due
to mismanagement, and that everything will
come out right in the end. A BuiAetin man
who saw the property a while ago is sceptical.
The requiem of Borneo Oil Syndicate
(W.A.) is being chanted. Dutch vendors
refused to modify terms or to extend the
time for payment of a further instalment of
£5OOO, consequently the option has lapsed.
The syndicate, which was advised by Edna
May’’ Williams, spent £B4OO in prospecting,
Williams’s travelling expenses, geological re-
ports, etc., and paid the vendors £6OOO to-
wards the purchase-price of £lOO,OOO. All
that it has left is a little cash and some
rather dearly bought experience.

The Tarcoola Blocks crowd has forked
out the cash for the Springvale lead : mine
near Ajana (W.A.), and is confident of
doing well. Most Ajana lodes are small,
but in the Springvale the shoot is of fair
size and length and of good value. Shallow
working and no refractory stuff are also
mentioned as points in its favor.
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) struggles on.
Monthly returns are fairly substantial, but
costs, plus London expenses, cut deep into
receipts. The co. has appealed to the State
Government for financial assistance —Golden
Horseshoe got backing from this source,
and the Gwalia board is hopeful of doing
likewise. Threats of shutting down are in
the air, and as the Labor Government is
anxious to avoid any more unemployment
on the goldfields the co. will probably get
something.

“Sandhurst”: In all 11 mines at Clunes
(Vic.) produced 1,200,0000 z. before the
field surrendered to water troubles. Six
gold-bearing reefs were worked, more or less,
for a length of two miles, and no quartz
worth less than half an ounce was ever
crushed, because it was considered too poor.
The history of the quarrel between the gold-
producing cos. on the central line of reef in
Clunes is too tedious and too pitiable to re-
count. While the directors bickered the
water gradually beat the two lOin. pumps
which were struggling with a water-front of
two miles. The workings filled, and Clunes
ceased to produce. Recently the New Clunes
Co., financed by a Melbourne crowd, work-
ing about four miles from Clunes, struck two
lodes about one chain apart, carrying 18in.
of quartz worth about 30dwt. It is pro-
posed to erect a plant to enable the miners
to sink the shaft to 150 ft. In this case there
is not enough water for crushing, but man-
ager A. Ryan, of Talbot, hopes to get sufli-
cient for working at 150 ft. The result may
again attract attention to Clunes.

A Royal Commission that has been com-
misliing so long as to be almost forgotten
has been inquiring into the possibility of
using Maoriland coal in Maoriland locos.
It has emerged to announce that quite a
number of indigenous coals will fill the bill.
This will cause M.L. coal cos. to rejoice
exceedingly; but there will be some curses
elsewhere. The firemen pin their faith to
Newcastle, and have no time either for
Welsh, which they had to use during the
miners’ strike of a few years ago, or for the
local stuff. Maoriland produces coal of all
sorts, from the Westport of magnificent steam-
ing qualities down to low-grade brown coals,
but the firemen don’t expect to get much
Westport. The Government’s railway policy is
to keep the loco men sweet, but the purchase
of £500,000 to £700,000 worth of coal from
Newcastle each year is getting too much of a
price to pay for maintaining a little hold over
a railway service that uses a lot of threaten-
ing language to its employers.

A caU- of ss. per share is due on the
154,750 issued in November by Taranaki
Oil Fields, Ltd. This will bring the con-
tribs. to 15s. Meantime the drill at Tarata,
when last heard of, was plugging away in
shale at 4625 ft., and the co. was making
good time with the assembling of plant at
the new site on the east coast. Scrip is
not in demand, but prices have been moved
up several shillings within the past three
weeks.

“Bildad’s” unkind comments: —
I have not one grain of faith in the theories of
“K.,” who gives the United States oil people such a
beautiful certificate of character re the Roma bores.
It. seems to be proved that a U.S. expert, who was
expected to develop them, went in for deliberate
wreckage instead, and there is no reason to suppose
that he hadn’t backers. K.” says that the U.S. oilers
had no need to take violent preventive measures, be-
cause they have “the machinery and finance to
immediately buy in or indirectly acquire all the
interests he might want” in Australian oil, if such
were found. In Queensland 9425 acres out of every
10,000 belong to the State. It sells nothing, and
it is quite ready to resume any pa it of the private
575 acres on small provocation. Thus the oilers may have
“the machinery and finance to immediately buy in”
Queensland oil leases or Queensland railways, and
yet fail both ways. “K.” scoffs particularly at the
idea of “a field being wrecked before it is actually
a proven oil region.” What better time to
wreck it 1

Alluvial Tin (F.M.S.) announces its in-
tention to distribute 230,000 bonus- shares
pro rata among the holders of the existing
20 000 shares. Accounts for the year closed
with March, and the annual meeting: is
timed for May 14 at Rawang, in the State
of Selangor. Though Alluvial Tin and its
litter of pups have not yet contributed one
ounce of tin to the world’s supplies, the
parent co. has made a welter of the flotation
industry, and has in that connection re-
ceived considerable wads in cash and kind
from a group of non-productive concerns.
Whereas Austral Malay share values were
huilt on tin for the greater part, Alluvial
Tin values (or prices) have been built wholly
on paper. Criticism need not be quite so
emphatic were even one of the subsidiary
cos. producing. Malim Nawar, the first of
the litter, has threatened to do so on several
occasions, December last being at one stage
officially mentioned. But December has faded
into April, and Malim Nawar plant is still
silent. The deadwood being carried by the
subsidiary cos. may be gauged by the
£230,000 purse the parent proposes to pre-
sent to itself at their expense.

Netherlands Eastern Syndicate has received
ite report from E. M. Di Villa on the oil
areas held by it in the Sourabaya Residency,
Java. Of the 16,000 hectares in the several
concessions in Ojombang and Madjakerta, the
most easterly ones, totalling 2000 hectares
(approximately 5000 acres), have been finally
selected for acquisition and development.
The areas are on the famous Lidah anticline,
east of some held by the Koloniale (Standard
of New York) and west of the main pro-
ducing properties of the Royal Dutch. Active
drilling is being prosecuted by both cos., and
arrangements have been made for this syn-
dicate to place a standard rig of the Kolo-
niale’s on its property during the remainder
of the option, now increased to 18 months.
A reduction in purchase price to £25,000
from the originally-stipulated £lOO,OOO is
very reasonable, considering the excellent
situation and structural conditions. The
main anticline strikes east-west, with dips
to the n. and s. up to 20 degrees. It is five
to six miles across, and the miocene rocks
have been elevated to about 6000 ft. Minor
anticlines parallel to the main fold are also
in evidence. A pumping well on the pro-
perty now yields from the shallow sands up
to four barrels a day of the usual high-
quality Java oil, but Di Villa expects “flow”
production lower down.
Pulo, Burma, controlled from Queen-street,
Melbourne, got off its satellite, Satu Pulo,
which is to work 350 acres at Takuapa, in
West Siam. If the pound ground set out in
the prospectus averages 25ft. or 26ft. over
the area, the 130,000-yd. bucket dredge timed
to commence earth-eating in July, 1927,
should give a good account of itself each
month. Pulo itself has 1800 acres of Bur-
mese territory.

The "Straits Settlements,” as London calls
the Federated Malay States, Siam and
Burma in the tin sense, still supply the hulk
of the world’s tin. For 1925 73,390 tons
was shipped; the 1924 figure was 1000 tons
more. Bolivia increased its output from
26,725 to 34,191 tons. Nigeria supplied 6113
tons, against 6056 tons in 1924. The United
States took 76,455 tons, or 12,330 tons
above its 1924 supply, in order to cope
with its voracious tin plate and automobile
requirements. All pools having been cleaned
up, a steady movement in U.ix. tin towards
the U.S. set in. Opening in January last
year at £265, the market had receded to £237
in April, after which a steady demand sent
prices to £268 in December. The middle of
March this year saw the rate within £3 of
£3OO, but since then there has been a per-
sistent retreat, the price now being £279.
Tin has always been the mystery metal, and
even now, with Uncle Sam a world’s buyer
and supplies apparently short, there is no
guarantee as to which way or how far the
market will move.

New Guinea Oil Co. has hung fire for so
long that there was no rush for shares
when Sydney Stock Exchange listed the stock
last week, concurrently with the reported
starting of drilling operations at the Hohoro
site. Driller Moore reported that a 20m.
hole had been begun on March 18, and the
setting of the 15Jin. casing was the next
task. It is a year since the plant arrived
at Moresby from ’Frisco, but several feet of
rain above the average cut off transport.
The bore site on the Vailala River is only
about two miles from the coast, but the
difficulties were immense.

The worst of working a copper-mine is
that if it doesn’t pay it eats up cash as
fast as an opera company. At New Guinea
Copper the last hang-up was due to the
pyrites firing. Since then trouble has arisen
over securing the right furnace feed. So
smelting is to stop for a bit to allow of the
installation of a plant to sinter the fines;
also an electric generator. All this means
further cash, and with copper below £59 it
is hard to see where profits have come from
to provide it unless Erie Huntley has sur-
passed himself at Laloki. Pending reorgan-
isation of the smelting, four months partial
exemption has been granted and 40 men have
been put Cff.
From an old friend of The Bulletin on
the spot:—
In China at present there is practically only one
mine producing lead and zinc ores, and, through
lack of exploration, its known lenses are near deple-
tion. An organised system of corruption starves
the mines of money for exploration and, although
air drills and diamond-drill boring plant are avail-
able, those in charge have not the necessary technical
knowledge to handle them. Last year some 5000
tons lead ore and 25,000 tons zinc ore were exported,
chiefly to Belgium and Germany. The ore is worth
about 58 p.c. lead, 230 z. silver and 12 p.c. zinc.
The zinc concentrate is worth about 30 p.c. zinc,
14 p.c. lead and lOoz. silver. That the bulk of
China’s metal exports come from Hunan is largely
a matter of transport. There are equally productive
deposits in other provinces such as Szechuan,
Kweichow and Kwangsi, not to mention the vast
undeveloped resources of Manchuria and Mongolia.
But whereas most of these are not easily got ai,
Hunan is exceptionally well provided with rivers
and lakes, almost every part being within 10 miles
of some navigable stream. Ores can be loaded in
small junks and transferred to larger ones—cheap
water transport all the way to the deep-sea steamers.
The lack of railways or good roads in the other
parts of China near the ore deposits, apart from
corruption, war and brigandage, practically prohibits
production for export.

“Flag-wagger”: A workmate of mine
who confessed a horror of warfare staunchly
forced himself to accompany me to the
recruiting-office early in 1915. He sustained
his first casualty at Broadmeadows (Camp,
fainting when he was inoculated. A dozen
times he confided to me his sickening fear
that he would prove a coward when called
upon to face cold steel. At Anzac he was
shaking as if he had fever. Fortunately the
unit never came*to handgrips with Abdul
there, and no occasion came for Bill to dis-
grace his uniform. Our first experience mf
the hellishness of war was during the 1916
Somme offensive. Our company occupied an
advanced trench recently vacated by Fritz,
whence it was necessary to send an urgent
message to battalion h.q. The O.C. sent four
signallers, one after the other, to cross a
bullet-swept area. Each met his death. Then
lie called for a volunteer, and the first to
respond was Bill. In a subsequent letter from
a Blighty hospital he told that he could have
cut his tongue off the moment after lie had
uttered the word. Yet, as he had forced mm-
self to the recruiting-office, he forced him-
self to cross that hell of bullet-swept, shell-
torn, open ground. Once he dropped ; then,
though wounded, he rose and safely nego-
tiated the rest of the danger-zone. He was
recommended for a high decoration and
awarded the Military Medal. in
Aussie he told me he felt the biggest of hypo-
crites when, at an English camp, the 0.0.
pinned the medal upon his breast. He.
never worn either medal or ribbon since,
and nothing will convince him that, although
lie has been, acclaimed a hero, he is not at
heart a coward. # #
“Pat Bushic”: There are at least three
men in Queensland who believe _ there is
something in dreams. The Main Roads
Board has gangs of men working m dif-
ferent shires. Early this year one shire
engineer had over £5OO in pay to take out
from town to the gang under Ins control.
The night before pay-day he dreamed that
he was stuck up and robbed, right alongside
the big white entrance gates to a station, _a
landmark in the district, yet an extremely
lonely spot. He tried to dismiss the matter
from his mind, and went to liis office, where
the shire clerk was showing a very worried
look. He, too, it came out, had been dream-
ing, and liis dream was identical with that
of the engineer. After some deliberation
they decided to take out the money by a
roundabout route, and arrived safely at the
camp The foreman had only been in the
gang a fortnight. He had just arrived from
the Islands and knew nothing of the district,
yet when the pair arrived with the cash
he thought it worth mentioning, as a good
joke, that he had dreamed they were stuck
up at a lonely place where there was a pair
of hig white gates. Thereupon the engineer
and clerk determined to return past those
white gates and examine the roadside. They
discovered, by the tracks, that a car had
turned into a bush near the gates and stayed
there for some time. There were also many
footmarks to indicate that men had been
standing about. #
“Riwaka”: .Tollyboy is head of one sec-
tion of a Government department, and Tape-
snip is his chief assistant. As junior offi-
cials, until Tapesnip married, they spent
many hectic leisure hours together. For
many years Tapesnip has been a solemn,
earnest man with an unblemished reputation
as a wowser. Time has sobered .Tollyboy
too but there is nothing of the wowser aboiit
him. The other day Tapesnip called to liis
room several newly-joined youths to give
them some good advice. He instanced Jolly-
boy and himself as examples of what they
might rise to by hard work and' righteous
living Perverse Fate decreed that at this
stage of the address Jollyboy should enter
the room. “Ah, Mr. Jollyboy,” said the
moralist, “I was just telling these yoons
felkrws how w T e used to buck into it when
we were young.” Jollyboy smiled. Aty
word we did, old chap,” he said. _ Remem-
ber the night you insisted on sitting in a
water-trough for nearly half an hour. lou
would argue it was the only scientific way to
cool the system.” Tapesnip’s homily ter-
minated abruptly.

“Astern”: Some of Tasmania’s early
settlers thought nothing of giving their
ticket-of-leave retainers a »30-mile walk to
collect a hiding. One method, when an ex-
convict was held to have merited corporal
punishment, was to hand him a turkey to
take along with a note to the nearest magis-
trate. The doomed man would mostly go
on his errand cheerfully, reckoning that the
poultry would ensure him a cordial reception
and probably a drink or two ; it was a bitterly
disillusioned wretch who would presently be
dragging his aching carcase on the 30-mile
return journey. One cunning old covey
took his lashes by proxy—handed the note
and the bird to a passing teamster, who
injudiciously undertook to deliver them.

“Ricardo” : Finger-prints can be forged, and
have been. A friend of mine, Milton Carl-
son, of Los Angeles
(U.S.A.), has de-
monstrated this in
court. He appeared
as an expert wit-
ness for the defence
at the tidal of
“Fatty” Arbuckle
for the murder of
Virginia Sappe.
The prosecution
produced a bed-
room door showing
finger-prints and
hand-prints alleged
to have been made
by Arbuckle and
the woman while
she was struggling
to escape. Carlson
proved that the
prints were fabrica-
tions. In a big
burglary case at
Valdez, Alaska,
which turned upon
two finger-prints
on a pane of glass,
he produced prints
of his own fabrica-
tion. He claims to
have been the first
to demonstrate that
such things can be
forged; i.e., that
prints identical
with those of an
innocent person
may be transferred
by meehanica-1
means to any
article at the scene
of a crime.
“Sparc Corp”: Harry had been advised
by letters from home that his younger brother,
Jack, had joined up, and was to be in the
same battalion; but, wounded at Pozieres,
he was away in hospital when Jack arrived
with the reinforcements to mend the holes
in the unit. When Harry got back again
his first question was for his brother; he
learned that, two days before, the youngster
had got a knock, and was taking Ms turn
in hospital. Harry got another issue at Pas-
sehendaele, and Jack was again amongst the
re-builders of the battalion. Harry, who had
been invalided to Australia, was rushed over-
seas when men were badly wanted jn 1918,
but in the exigencies of the period was
diverted to another unit, with which he im-
mediately went into the line, only to get
wounded for the third time. On the second
morning of his stay at No. 15 Casualty
Clearing Station at St. Omer the nurse re-
marked : “The young Digger they brought m
last night, in the next bed,. has the same
name as yourself.” Something like a yell
disturbed the ward as the two brothers met,
after dodging each other for so long.
“Straphanger Too” : They scrambled into
the crowded Bondi tram, an honest-looking
working couple; and as she got a seat
while he had to stand, she took the paper
from him and threw aloft items of news as
she glanced through it. “It says ’ere that
Lord Stradbroke was touched on leaving
Australia,” she said. “Co orn!” he ejacu-
lated. “Cripes, some of these blokes are
’ot, ain’t they? ’Ow much did they bite

“The Listening Insect”: The American
short-wave broadcasting station WG Y,
whose home is near N’York, has established
a new worlcTs record with the assistance ot
keen ears in this country. WGY was throw-
ing into the ether some potted melody pri-
marily intended for music-lovers in South
Africa. The sun happened to be shining all
the nearest way between Australia and New
York, so that circumstances could not have
been less propitious for eavesdropping in
these regions. Nevertheless the wireless
waves found a way. Ignoring the direct
route they charged round the globe in the
wake of darkness and approached us from
the west, thus covering a distance of over
13,000 miles. In Melbourne the music was
heard as clearly as the gramophone in the
flat next door. The wave length was 32.79
metres. #
“Trampas”: He was a Swedish settler in
the Kununoppin district of Westralia, and
when existence began to pall he collected
all the dry timber and grass around the
place and built himself a pyre, liberally be-
daubing it with grease and oil. On top he
packed a small case of dynamite with a
packet of detonators jambed in the middle
of it. Then he lit his pyre, clambered on
top, took a swig of strychnine and blew his
head off with a charge from a 12-bore gun.
These final rites would not have been guess-
able by the local cop, who spent an hour
prospecting the scene, had not the oil and
grease conveyed the fire to the dynamite

before the stack of timber was fully
ablaze. The resultant explosion blew what
was left of Christofferson to fragments. The
gun, twisted out of shape, was found 50
yards away, an empty charge in the breech,
but a few drops of the strychnine, left in a
bottle magically unbroken, lay quite near
the centre of the general mess. So even the
Kununoppin cop had no difficulty in recon-
structing the tragedy, and for me, a press-
man travelling through the place that day,
it provided a gory little yarn to color the sober
columns of the West Australian.

“Ex-Dig.” : There was one man in the A.I.F.
who could have beaten Aaron Aarons for first

But .you can’t keep Cupid out,
Gipsy Smith.
Pungent words you have in loads,
Gipsy Smith—
Yours and Billy’ Sunday's modes
Kind o’ kith—
But a fellow’s thoughts may race
Clean away from hopes of grace
When he spies a pretty face,
Gipsy Smith.
Sparks of faith set crowds ablaze,
Gipsy Smith ;
That we know from Wesley’s days
Is no myth.
But when ey’es on tours embark
As inflammable a spark
Sometimes flies without remark,
Gipsy Smith.
Mute the messages that pass,
Gipsy Smith,
Yet they’d straddle a crevasse
Or a, frith.
Want your audiences’ entire
’Tention fixed on Sheol’s Are?
Keep ’em plainer in the choir,
Gipsy Smith.

Pharmacopoeia Sarsaparilla.
NEVER, LIKELY TO FORGET IT.
MRS: “You remember, dear , before we were married ”
MR: “Yes, of course, darling. It's my happiest recollection.”
“C.Q.” : Despite the prominence given their
operations in the papers, I have come to the
melancholy conclusion that the Melbourne
pushes are not what they were. The days
are gone when a gang of one-armed men
could terrorise a neighborhood with their
spiked wooden limbs, or when the story that
a secret society of homicidal maniacs habitu-
ally drank the blood of their victims could
gain general credence. Even their nomen-
clature is losing its sanguinary violence. Two
youths who appeared to answer a charge
of skylarking in front of a fisli-and-chips
shop the other day confessed to belonging
to a push known as the “Lyric Stars” !
“Alwyn”: Talking of the divers demands
made on obliging members of Parliament by
importunate constituents (B. 8/4/ 2o), a
bygone N.S.AV. Assemblyman, who repre-
sented the one out-back constituency for just
WELL AND TRULY.
“Well, you know, you courted trouble, old man.”
“ Courted? Yes, I caught it all right — fact, I married it.”
on 30 years, once received the following note
from an elector: “Dear Sir, —Am sending to
your address a pair of boots which my wife
had sent up from Anthony Horderns’, but as
they are too small I want you to change
them for a pair of the length enclosed piece
of string; also to measure round the instep
same as other piece of string, which I like-
wise send you.”
* * * *
“FY7”: Not all the Easter “shearers” who
lie in wait for the unwary were enumerated
by “Hamer” (B. l/4/’26), and some of them
exercise their talents on town as well as
country folk. On
the eve of Good
Friday I bought a
paper on a King-
street tram from a
guileless - looking
babe, who forth-
with hopped off
the moving car
with the alacrity
of a flea deserting
a hot shovel. The
paper was three
days old —a small
matter, but it is
the little things
that' hurt.
* *
“Alwyn”: The
Hodgson divorce
case in Sydney
wasn’t a record
for length. The
Vincent case, de-
cided in favor of
the wife at Sydney
in 1910, occupied
24 days, 10 of
them devoted to
the hearing of evi-
dence. Thirty-nine
witnesses were ex-
amined, including
the co-respondent.
Mrs. Vincent was
under cross-exami-
nation for three
whole days, and
stood all the time.
She had a pretty
fancy; while giving
her evidence she
held a bouquet of violets under her nose.
The total expenses of that suit were £5500.
“Romeo” : How’s this for ingenuity ? At
Perth, as elsewhere, direct connection is
given from a public telephone; that is, the
called subscriber's telephone rings, but no
conversation can be carried on until the
caller inserts his twopence. A Mac who
sometimes has to work back has impressed
this on his wife. “If you get a ring at 6
o’clock you’ll know I won’t be home. Don’t
trouble to take the receiver off, because I
won’t put the twopence in.”
“Copabella”: Among the claims to fame of
Bundaberg (Q.) is that of having more
push-bikes per capita than any other city
in the State, if not the Commonwealth. Not
only that, but the
riders regularly do
things with them
seldom seen else-
where. Boys carry
their younger
brothers and sis-
ters, and young
men put their best
girls on the bar as
casually as the
motor-cyclist packs
his adorable on the
pillion-grid. Chil-
dren “double-dink-
ing” to school or
on errands are a
commonplace, and
occasionally one
sees a “treble-dink”
—o n e on the
pedals, one on the
seat, and a third
astride the back
mudguard. The
natives have not
yet arrived at
carrying a mate
sitting on the
handlebars or
standing on cleats
on the front forks,
but that no doubt
will come, and the
super-family of five
will bike to school
on one machine.
Fathers with in-
fants in outrigger
seats on the bar
are frequent, but
the young mother
who carries her 10-
months-old baby in
a basket over the
front wheel of her
machine still has the field to herself.
* * * *
“M.G.S.” : National traditions die hard.
In China when a man falls ill he does not
send for the doctor. His family and friends
prescribe for him, and it would he grave
discourtesy on his part if he refused to swal-
low their prescriptions, though occasionally
he may suggest that the money would be
better spent on a coffin. A Chinaman died
in the Melbourne Hospital the other day.
It transpired that, three days before, lie had
been shockingly burned by. a petrol-tin ex-
ploding. When the hospital orderlies found
him he was treating himself, at the earnest
solicitations of his friends, with curry-
powder ! # 9
“Sixenate”: The other day a Sydney
magistrate coupled with his. sentence upon
a woman convicted of shoplifting a recom-
mendation that steps should be taken to
declare her an habitual. This
is tlie first time such a re-
commendation has been
made in Sydney about a
woman. The recipient of
the dishonor has been sen-
tenced 27 times for shop-
lifting, and she stepped out
of gaol to commit her last
offence. According to a
man who should know', not
one in ten thefts by shop-
lifters is detected, so she has
had either a good innings or
rotten luck.
* * '*
“Bosso”: I, too, know a
well-meaning citizen who un-
wittingly interfered in a
scrap between a cop in plain
clothes and an evildoer (B.
l/4/’26). He had stopped
his car only just in time to
avoid running over two men
who were struggling on the
ground, almost under his
wheels. As one of the com-
batants was sitting on the
other, the peacemaker jumped
out and hauled the top dog
off his opponent, remarking :
“Let him up and have a fair
go!” Then there was a
mutual recognition between
the cop and the self-appointed
referee. The latter apolo-
gised for his mistake; but
J. Hop’s dignity was so
badly cracked that he hauled
the offender before the court for “interfer-
ence.” Tile magistrate straightened his face
with an effort and dismissed the case.
* * * *
“Cascade” : One day a week or so ago two
very angry women, each with a hand on
an expensive purse, called at Russell-stre'et
(Melbourne) police headquarters. No. Is
story was that she had been walking into
the ‘ Melbourne Hospital when she was
accosted by No. 2 and accused of having
stolen the purse. Indignantly she added that
she had bought it from a reputable second-
hand dealer, to whom she would take the
police at that moment. No. 2 said that all
she knew was that it was her purse, which
she would recognise anywhere, and that it
had been stolen from her home over six
months ago. The superintendent smoothed
matters over by explaining that there had
recently been a sale of stolen property which
had not been claimed, and the lady who
bought it from the second-hand dealer was
entitled to its possession. The lawful owner
went away vowing that she would provide
the newspapers with an interesting court
story in. an action for damages for defama-
tion of character.
* * * *
“Ricardo” :At Ncw Farm (Brisbane) the
other day a volume of smoke was seen pour-
ing out of a residence at the rear of a little
shop in Brunswick-street, which was closed
at the time. A passer-by rushed to the_ near-
est fire-alarm and summoned the brigade,
which turned out promptly, and arrived on
the scene gorgeous in brass helmets and shin-
ing equipment. A stage-coach full of Red
Indians and cowboys advertising a Wild
West picture came along at the same time
and added to the impressiveness of the tableau.
Before the firemen could uncoil their hoses
an enterprising person forced the kitchen door,
and discovered that all the smoke was coming
from a pot of Irish stew which had been
left to simmer on the stove and had caught
fire. A bucket of water did the necessary,
and the brigade tore away again. The house-
wife, who has since received a bill claiming
£l5 10s. for the brigade’s services, is disput-
ing the account. She reckons it is hard lines
if a woman can't cook a pot of Irish stew
without the fire brigade turning out.
* * * *
“Wang”: The lady of the house had been
so affected by Dustbin Dan’s hard-luck tale
that she had presented that hard-bitten hum-
mer with 55., and the unexpected munificence
of the gift had loosed a surging torrent of
gratitude and laudation that threatened to
submerge the benefactor. “There, there,
that’ll do,” she managed to interject at last;
“you aren’t one of those grateful people who
are too full for words, anyway.” Dan looked
at her hard till he comprehended her mean-
ing—or thought he did. “No, Mum,” he
hastened to assure her. “I ain’t that sort.
Not just now,” and his gaze travelled down
the street towards the pub “but later,
p’r’aps.” „
* * * *
“Herodot”: This happened at a town in
the south-west of Queensland. A young
married woman was sitting in a chair be-
neath a vine-covered trellis when a three-foot
tree-snake fell out of the vines into her lap.
The reptile twisted itself around her arm,
and by the time that her shrieks had brought
assistance it had one of its coils around her
neck, so that some difficulty was experienced
in killing it and freeing her. The snake was
a non-venomous one, and there were no worse
effects than those of the shock. _ When baby
was born, three months later, it had on its
left shoulder and upper arm a bluish mark,
JUST TO PLEASE THE COOK.
MADAM (engaging cook): “I think yon mil find the place
easy enough, as we have no children .”
C OOK: “Oh. don’t restrict a family on my account, Mum
—I just dote on babies."
which, though indistinct for an hour or so
after birth, eventually resolved itself into an
unmistakable serpent. As the child grew
older the markings became more distinct.
Strangely enough, the outline seems to be
sharper at some times than at others; there
have been occasions when the head of the
snake has been almost photographic. It is
more than possible, however, that as the
child grows up the marks will disappear
altogether.
THE SHOWER-SINGERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The orchestra of singing seas
May set the heart a-throb;
Points have those bards of wood and brass
Who really know their job.
But there’s an orchestra with power
To stir a mightier throng—
The music of the bathroom shower
Wakes all the world to song!
Its rain pours on the dry, parched world
Of flesh that harbors Me;
And, freshening every hill and dale,
It wakens melody.
It opens out the buds of song,
Till, bursting bonds of clay,
My voice floats on the “Ocean Wave,”
Or sails from “Dublin Bay.”
Must not the splash of falling drops
Some soft, green fancies wake
Or thoughts of violets plucked at morn
For some sweet lady’s sake?
Of “Lovely Gardens” I may know
Or “Islands of the Sea”
Where Kathleen, Maud or twenty mere
May spend an hour with me?
Or, if the water falls like drums,
Shall it not stir the breath
To “Like a Soldier Fall” or else
Remain quite “True Till Death”?
Or gurglings deep within the pipes
May stir a merry rhyme—
Wine-thoughts of jolly comrades all
“Drink-Drinking ” all the time 1
The next-door girl has smiles for me
Whene’er I go abroad;
She thinks that I am wooing her—
I’ve found her name is Maud.
But one must sing of any girl
Whose name is cast in song,
When morning-showers have stirred the blood
With music’s impulse strong.
Our bathrooms blossom melody
As breakfast-time draws nigh—
The modern songs and olden songs,
And songs that sob and sigh.
One man next door on “Mona” calls,
One praises “Nancy Lee” ;
But “Bonny Mary of Argyle”
Is good enough for me.
As morning marches round the earth
The chain of song extends
Until it links with us again—
Its joyance never ends!
The shower orchestral fills the world
Along the sun’s wide path ;
Our union of musicians stands,
The Songsters of the Bath !

Vic.’s departing Governor, Lord Strad-
broke, did much travelling about the State
on his lonesome seeing things as they were
and without fuss and feathers. On the
Cudgewa railway line he was giving a
harassed guard a hand to square his van
up when a lanky bushraan called for his
chaff. “What do you want chaff for?” asked
Stradbroke. “To feed my sanguinary horses
on. What else?” was the reply. “But what
do you grow here?” persisted his Ex. “Stink-
wort and blanky rabbits,” answered the son
of the soil. A little later a horrified railway-
man got the chance to explain who the visi-
tor was, and a worried bushman came to the
carriage to apologise. “It's all right,” he
was assured, “but why not try to grow some-
thing beside stinkwort and blanky rabbits?”
Knight John Gellibrand, who displaced
Dave O’Keefe as M.H.R. for Denison
(Tas.), is a grand-
son of Joseph Tice
Gellibrand, the
creator and most
enthusiastic sup-
porter of the land
syndicate that de-
spatched Batman
across the Straits
as its agent in
1835. Later on
the new M.H.R.’s
ancestor set out to
visit the syndicate’s
possession, disap-
peared somewhere
between Corio and
his objective, and
was never heard of
again.

A new signature will shortly appear on
Commonwealth bank-notes. James R. Col-
lins, permanent head of the Treasury, is to
go to London to act as financial adviser to
the High Commissioner. Under the new
scheme for Federal borrowing he is to sit
on the London board of the Commonwealth
Bank, which will handle the credits at that
end, and he will act as a sort of liaison
officer between the bank and the High Com-
missioner’s office. His public service dates
back 40 years: he was 17 when he first
became a Treasury clerk.
The Vic. Labor movement gained a valu-
able recruit when Jean Daly was appointed
country organiser to the A.L.P. at the recent
conference. Miss Daly has been a supporter
for the last 10 years, but hitherto she has
only folded up her cook’s apron and gone
into the fray at election times. Grand-dad
Daly, who took part in the first shearers'
strike, instilled Labor ethics into her, and
she learnt something about politics from
Cohen, K.C., leader of the State National-
ists in the Upper House. Once when
a resolution to admit women to Par-
liament was being considered in the House,
a member remarked that politics would gain
a brilliant mind by the entry of Jean Daly.
‘‘And I,” remarked Cohen, “would lose 1 a
first-rate cook.”
When Collins, secretary to the Federal
Treasury, goes to London as financial adviser
to the High Commissioner, the next man, C.
J. Cerutty, will become Auditor-General, and
Heathershaw, the accountant, will step up to
the job Collins is vacating. Heathersliaw is
one of three brothers—sons of the manse—
who have done well. Of the other two W.
P. is permanent head of the Vic. Chief Secre-
tary’s Department, and Syd. is Secretary to
the Police Department —he was Acting-
Chief when Edward PI was here.
On the departure of Governor Stradbroke
from Vic. last week Lieut.-Gov. Irvine took
over the rubber-stamp, and will hold it till
Baron Somers arrives in a few weeks. Two
days before the Chief Justice assumed office
he had to go into mourning for his sister
Fanny, who died at South Yarra. The little
mother and the sisters who accompanied
William from Ireland 47 years ago have
now all found graves in the new land.
George Judah Cohen will be 84 on April
27, but he still sits up and takes notice at
many board meetings. His importance lies
not only in his own wealth and sagacity; he
is the chief at this end of the world of
a mighty financial clan which has its roots
in England—one of the five richest clans
in the world: its aggregate wealth makes
the possessions of some individual million-
aires appear small. The foundations of the
fortune this end were laid by Samuel Cohen,
George Judah’s father, who nailed up David
Cohen and Qo.’s sign in 1836; yet he was
an affluent citizen before that. The family
has been the chief pillar of the Sydney Great
Synagogue. George Judah was president for
several years, and his son, S. S. Cohen,
followed on.
Youth is much - to the fore at the Austra-
lian Chess Championship Congress which has
been raging in Sydney. The 22-year-old
Woinarski early secured first position, and
the young son of Dr. Purdy, the schoolboy
player of a couple of years ago, was in third
place after five rounds had been played.
Woinarski’s play made a sensation. In his
first game he had Spencer Crackanthorp (ex-
champion of N.S.W. and champion of M.L.)
in difficulties at the 17th move, and would
have won, probably, but for the carelessness
engendered by a premature elation which let
his cool-headed elder retrieve his losses and
led to a draw; but then in turn he beat
Wallace. Boyce and Ingledew, the champions
of N.S.W., Queensland and Tasmania, and
capped all by beating Viner out of his first-
move advantage, and conquering the cham-
pion of Australia in a brilliant game finished
in 30 moves. Viner may now be below his
best form, but, as he recently secured sixth
place in the British championship contest the
young Victorian’s achievement is a great
one. He is the son of that brilliant legal
light, Casimir Julius Woinarski, who assisted
Cussen in the consolidation of the Statute
Law of Victoria. His mother was Lily Mus-
grove, daughter of George, and he is now
in his final year in Law at the Melbourne
University, where he has won high distinc-
tion.
When kings and queens and conquerors
in war are dim memories a grateful, well-
fed world may give reverence to the name
of Luther Burbank. Burbank occupied the
77 years allotted to him —the end came the
other day —in juggling with plants and
flowers, and no stage-juggler ever showed
such miracles. A multitude of new hybrids
owe their origin to his experiments; but
these are amongst the lesser part of his
achievements. His greatest work was in
the stimulation of crops; and here he made
immensely important contributions to the
science of production. Since 1875 he has
had Ins nurseries at Santa Rosa, California,
where he died.
A branch of an old Australian tree fell
when Arthur Bowman died in Sydney. His
grandfather, George Bowman, arrived in N.
S. Wales in 1797, and was a pioneer of
Hunter River settlement. Arthur Bowman,
who had his training at St. Andrew’s and
Sydney Uni., was a solicitor by profession,
but inherited possessions enabled him to fol-
low sporting and squatting predilections. He
was one of the directors of the Moorefield
R. C-, and owned horses himself. One of
them was Earl Derby, which won a Canter-
bury Cup during the Prince’s visit, to Ed-
ward Windsor’s enrichment.
The Australasian has so developed the role
of the leader of enterprise that it is not
surprising to find a Maorilander at the head
of the great gold venture in Panama which
has so agitated the cables. Duncan Elliott
Alves, who has secured a concession covering
the gold rights in 5000 square miles of
Panama country, alleged to hold at least
one gold reef of remarkable richness, and
who has the backing of some of Britain’s
wealthiest Jews, was born in Dunedin, the
son of a civil engineer who subsequently re-
HARRY E. DOWNIE, Tasmania’s Taxation,
Commissioner, who has been helping the
Local Government prepare its case for
special Commonwealth consideration.
moved his practice to Melbourne. Alves,
who is 56, went abroad for the opportunities
his own country did not give him, and did
so well that before the present big venture
he was chairman of the Venezuelan Oil Con-
cessions and life-president of British Oil-
fields, Ltd.
Maoriland continues to export brains. The
new Professor of Psychology and Education
at the University of British Columbia is
Jennie Benson Wyman,, who used to be
Jennie Moore, of Dunedin. Maoriland
University turned her out as a Master of
Science, but the best her native land could
give her was a subordinate post on the teach-
ing staff of a girls’ school. Six years ago
she went to the United States, got her A.M.
and Pli.D. at Stanford without much trouble,
and won recognition as a world authority on
psychological measurements.
Just-dead T. H. Barlow was most notable
during recent years as a persistent attendant
at Sydney art shows and a collector of pic-
tures ; but he was also a keen appreciator
of literature, and he loved every inch of
Sydney; he himself wrote many articles on
its historical associations. As an alderman
he gave the city good service for 20 years,
and at one time entertained political ambi-
tions ; Henry Parkes was his opponent in
one contest.
Mourning for the death of Arthur Dobson
who dropped dead in Melbourne on Friday
was not confined to the trade unionists he
served so well for more than 30 years. Since
1920 he had been one of the best known of
city councillors. His thoroughness, his rea-
sonableness, and liis knack of getting on with
people were qualifications that made him a
force where Laborites were not at first wel-
come. In the days when sweating had to
be fought Dobson was in the front rank of
the attackers. In those times he was not
ashamed to be a banner-bearer for Alec Pea-
cock, Minister for Labor, who put through
the Wages Board legislation. Remembering
that co-operation, Peacock was one of the
first to pay tribute to the dead.
A strange tip was given on Saturday to
a Sydney acquaintance of Captain Joshua
Ilort, leading to the backing of Red Gauntlet
in the Rous Handicap, in which the horse
had a good win. On the train going to the
races a mutual friend mentioned that the old
seafarer had died, and the punter recalled
that Hort’s first command in Australian
waters was named Red Gauntlet. Ilort,
who was 81 years old, was a notable skipper
in the clipper days, but left the sea to be-
come first a farmer near Orange and then a
produce agent. But a desire to return to his old
love came to him, and when 75 years old
he shipped as mate on the Manurewa. One
trip satisfied his longing for another taste
of the salt sea winds, otherwise Hort’s obitu-
ary might have been written earlier —the
Manurewa was soon afterwards posted “miss-
ing.”
It has been common enough for Arctic
explorers to freeze or starve while making
for the Pole or while making back in disgust;
but bow & well-provided and well-financed
expedition seems to have begun freezing and
starving befocre getting -out of its own
country. The Wilkins expedition planned to
take definitely to the air at Point Barrow,
the most northern spike of land the United
k-tates possesses. It is only about as close
to the Pole as Wrangel Island, which Stef-
ansson once fixed upotn as a nice place for a
permanent settlement. But April was prob-
ably too early in the year for a land party to
hump stores across these frosty regions, and
the caravan of explorers became lost and
snowed-ufp on its own premises in the pass
a ® e , ea anig > to its own front door. Wilkins,
the Australian leader, wasn’t with the party.
It might have progressed better if he had
been there, for Wilkins isn’t a man who
loses things readily.
Giles Shaw, chairman of Sydney stipen-
diary magistrates, has stepped <Jown, and the
lower-court Bench loses one of, its strongest
men. A barrister with University distinc-
tions, the editor of a local edition of Stephen’s
Law of EÞe, he had, moreover, the judi-
cial qualities of calm judgment and courage
of conviction. He goes out at 65, still full
of
Ahy this .distinction?” as'one of the soli-
citors at the farewell function asked.
W. P. Kielly, one of the five N.S.W.
Labor Leg. Councillors expelled from the
movement fcfr not voting on the Abolition
LiH, is a rival in height to Andy Lysaght,
the Wollongong M.L.A., being six-feet-three
-—with the most outstanding nose in either
branch of the Legislature. By trade he is
a lawyer, with the widest practice of any
N.S.W. country practitioner. He was a
Bathurst boy, and in his day a fine Rugby
Union footballer; in his middle-age he is a
keen bowler and an enthusiastic supporter
of up-country racing.
N. S. Wales railway men have lost a good
friend by the retirement, of Dr. G. H. Taylor,
chief of the medical staff, after 18 years
in that office. Before that he had been Gov-
ernment Pathologist and in the Health De-
partment—a varied experience. In each
branch he did notable service. His observa-
tions in cases of leprosy have received
acknowledgment from the English medical
•Stress, and for years past in Europe and
America his work in the fields of color-testing
apd the psychology of color has placed him
in k the front rank of research. N.S.W. rail-
way men are indebted mainly to his advocacy
for their well-equipped modern resting-
houses. When he took office such places
were Jittle better than fbuj dens.
Carqy, the Sydney A.L.P. secretary who
will cdttse to be an M.L.C. on the confer-
ence's ukase that no Parliamentarian may
hold office on the executive, is a very plump
and rubicund specimen ; of the downtrodden
and. dispossessed. When, party business took
him \to the suburban horpe of a Laborite who
talks' 1 even to his own household about the
capitalist and his crimes, the little girl who
answered the door looked scared, and ran to
a far roosp with a message. “Daddy,” Garey
heard her «ay in breathless tones, “you better
come; there’s a catterpdlist at the door.”
One of th<f trinity of university debaters

Labor-leader
GEORGE
MICHAEL
PREN DERGAST,
who, having
reached his 72nd
year, has shaved
off his moustache
and resigned the
leadership in
favor of a
younger man.
The impending departure of Parsons, J.,
has brought about changes in the legal world
of S. Australia. Crown Solicitor Richards
goes back to the bench as Acting-Judge, and
Digger Bean becomes Acting-Parliamentary
Draughtsman in place of Hannan, who
takes on the job of Crown Solicitor. The
other vacancy on the Crown Law staff —
caused by the appointment of Charlie
Sandery as Public Solicitor under the new
Legal Assistance for Poor Persons Act—has
been filled by Edgar Stevens, a son of a
one-time sub-editor of the Register, and
himself the writer of reams of “copy.”
THE OLD HORSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They’ve saddled the old horse up again, and he hasn't
an earthly chance.
(And it makes m© think of the shattered men that
were patched and sent back to France.)
They’ve swathed his legs in a mile of lint—for
they’re tenderhearted men—
And they’ve saddled him up for the two-mile sprint,
and they’re leading him out again.
Hooray! they’re leading him out again!
Just look at his old head held as high as ever it
used to be
(Ah, I’ve seen a cripple go out to die with as
proud a step as he!).
Just look at him now as he treads the sod with the
stride of a past prelim.,
To the jockey’s urge and a well-dug prod in the
scored old hide of him.
Hooray! the spur in the side of him!
Ten lengths in the lead and a mile to go and his
owner will have the cup.
(And there’s many a man with a roof of snow who
hadn’t the chance to give up!)
Ten lengths or seven or five or four? Well,
how can it matter what?
He’s dragging behind, and he’s stiff and sore from
the spurring and whip that he got.
Hooray! the blood-tipped spur that he got!
They’ve written him “last” in the press again.
Well, let it be written so;
For the track-done horses and war-smashed men go
back since they’re made to go—
They go with the lungs that are soon to rot or the
hearts that are soon to crack,
And they die in a war and are soon forgot or they
drop down dead on the track.
Hooray— to die as a patched-up patriot or to drop
down dead on the track!
Hip, dragging him from the track!
JtiSiW,
CECIL MANN.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“Trooper 926” : * “Canar” (B. 18/3/’26)
slips a bit when he says that a large hedge of
prickly-pear in the middle of Dalby (Q.) was the
original starting point of the prickly-pear curse in
that portion of the State. 'Actually, the start was
at Old Meranga homestead, where a hedge was
planted around the house, and stories are current
of station hands being sacked for purloining the
“fruit.” The cuttings for this hedge were brought
back from Ipswich on the return of the teamsters
who took the wool away. When the pear got com-
plete charge of things the Meranga homestead was
moved 10 miles away to what is known now as
Marmadua, where it still is. All the country along
the Moonee River was tip-top grazing country for
sheep in those days, and remains of the old shepherds’
huts and folding grounds are still to be seen.
THE FORGETFUL WARRIOR.
COUNSEL: “To accuse my client of running off with the cashbox is
absurd, your Worships > as I shall prove in a octuple of
seconds by ashing accused to remove his boot and sock to
show your Worships the serious war injury' he received,
which injury absolutely precludes him running at ail.”
ACCUSED ( hoarsely ): “Hi! —which foot was it, boss?”
“Taupo”: “Ricardo’s” champion (B.
11/3/’26) who sank a. pint of beer "without drawing
breath is well enough for the present decadent genera-
tion, but—listen to this. Many of the old hands
in Canterbury (M.L.) will remember Monty, the
omy drover ever known to habitually use a monocle.
One night in a pub at Christchurch 12 brimming
pints were placed in a row on the bar-counter, and
as the post-office clock began striking 12 Monty
lifted and drained the first pint, on the second stroke
the next, and so on until, as the clock finished striking,
there stood a dozen empty pint-glasses on the counter.
And Monty still wore his monocle, too.
* * * *
“Keppel”; “Hamer’s” trees (B. 11/3/’26)
bearing four different kinds of fruit are not record-
breakers. A Burrumbuttock (N.S.AV.) fanner has a
tree, 50 years old, which yields many more varieties
than that. A couple of years ago 20 kinds of stone
fruit were grafted on, and all are now bearing except
the cherries.
“Taiaha”: In seeking a remedy for the
blackberry pest, “Angora” (B. 4 /3/’26) has hit upon
the means found most effective in Maoriland, where
in some parts the spread of the vine has assumed
alarming proportions. So serious has the pest come
to be regarded that the Government has a standing
offer of £lO,OOO for the discovery of a method
of eradication, and so far the “cures” have proved
as ineffectual as quack remedies for cancer. While
bacteriologists are on the hunt for a parasite, prac-
tical pastoralists are following “Angora’s” method and
employing goats.
“H.C.”: I, too, have had good results from the use
of goats in reducing blackberries. I placed half
a dozen at a bush logging camp of mine which was
being over-run, and in 12 months the blackberries
were completely out. The result was surprising.
The trouble lies in the army’s lack of discipline.
Nothing under a 10ft. wall will prevent their break-
ing camp. Barbed wire they seem to eat.
* * * *
“Ller”: At Willow Tree last year I saw
a first-class scrap between a gaunt old bushman and
a political organiser. The bushman won after using
various unconventional blows. When it was over and
the drinks were being consumed, the organiser walked
in. “I think you misunderstood me,” he said to Dad.
“I said I was on the white man’s side every time.”
Dad gaped. “The hell you did! Why, I thought you
said you was on the white ants’ side every time.
Come an’ join us.”
* * * *
“Camnek” : “Kervic’s” “brigalow hopper”
(B. 18/2/’26) is probably identical with the “wood
locust” found in mallee scrub. It hops like a grass-
hopper, but can fly farther, eats leaves and, I reckon,
chews bark. Have struck ’em in hundreds, the past
few years, whilst scrub-clearing—-some up to sin. long.
Color varies according to the bark of the trees they
frequent—-except those on sandalwoods, which an
green. These latter I’ve seen only on the leaves;
never on bark.
* * * *
“Anaf”: An interesting feature of the
ordinary bush porcupine is that the female possesses
no mammary nipples, the secretion of the gland being
squeezed out through the tissues on to the outer skin,
from which the young one licks it. Because of this
it is probable that porcy and the platypus represent the
oldest form of mammalian life, all other contemporary
varieties having vanished. With these exceptions,
there are no living mammals in which the complete
nipple has not been evolved.
* * * *
“Pick”: When at dusk the wild animals
venture from the bushland for water, each tribe
has its customary methods of approach to the drink-
ing pool. Wallaroos collect in a mob at the fringe
of the scrubland and then, in a body slip across the
intervening space. They drink hastily, and at a
signal rush back to cover. Wallabies come haltingly
in single-file. For long they sit watchfully before
stooping to the water.
All safe, they drink
leisurely and play with
one another on the
banks before leaving.
Kangaroos lope warily
from the shadows, and
after every jump stop
t o reconnoitre the
ground ahead. Often
without apparent reason
they hop back, to
emerge from another
point. They drink
greedily, and tear off
seemingly without their
fill, perhaps to again
return uneasily later in
the evening. Wombats
zigzag from the scrubs
and seek cover on the
clearing. Stealthily
they root through grass
and bracken and squat
instantly at sound or
movement. They shuffle
to the water, sip ner-
vousl3 r , dart away, re-
turn for another gulp,
and then depart more
hurriedly than they
came. In the wilds the
dingo is king. At the
pool all other animals
stand back with respect
while he drinks. He
laps the water, rolls
in it, and stirs up the
mud. Then with
hungry leers at the fleeter fellows he knows he
cannot catch, he marches away, leaving them to the
water he has fouled.
* * * *
“Buttenderry”: I showed “ Johnar’s” par.
(B. 18/3/’26) to a neighbor who, like myself, has
spent a few years in the cattle-country and done a
bit of scrub-dashing in his day. When he left he
was wearing a grin that looked like being per-
manent. “Johnar” should bear in mind that all old
drovers, and most of the young ones, are inveterate
leg-pullers. This particular one, however, who de-
scribed how the gentle scrubber, when disturbed,
“squats on the ground like a rabbit” and coyly hides
his head, is more than a leg-puller. He’s an artist
* * * *
“Bouragi”: After years of strenuous
endeavor and vast expense, the problem of establish-
ing the true salmon, one of the world’s most valuable
fishes, in the Southern Hemisphere seems to have
been solved. Official reports from Maoriland put it
beyond all doubt that the quinnatt salmon from the
American North Pacific coast have been successfully
introduced, and are now running the rivers from
the Clutha to the AVaiau, in North Canterbury. The
salmon’s peculiar habit of returning annually from
the sea to the river in which he was spawned has
made him difficult material for transplantation. Spawn
from Britain has failed consistently in the Dominion
as well as Tasmania. If the former can make a
success with the quinnatt, there seems no reason
why the southern rivers of the island should not
prove a home from home for the desirable fish—
desirable, because, apart from his sporting value, the
salmon’s acclimatisation heralds a large and lucra-
tive industry for the Shivery Isles.
QUALIFIED.
HOUSEHOLDER ( going away for holiday) : “Can you drive a car?”
Applicant for Caretaker’s Job: “I’m sorry, I can't.”
HOUSEHOLDER: “You’ll do. The last man I left in charge thought he could.”
“Wilga”: The despised starling is really
one of the best friends the sheepman has in N. S.
Wales. If there is a verminous member in the
flock the starlings will undertake the eleaning-up
process. They also destroy millions of the larvte
of blowflies, and no doubt do more good in this
direction than the other. Grasshoppers’ eggs, too, are
a dainty with them, so that they attack three of the
worst pests the squatter has to contend against.
“Keppel”: Farmers have varying opinions of the
starling. In one district are some who would kill
every starling they saw, whilst others would never
touch one. The starling does some good by destroy-
ing ticks and other harmful insects,: but this is more
than counterbalanced by its depredations. A recent
attempt was made., by representatives of the different
pests-destruetion boards in Queensland to have opera-
tions against these birds suspended, but it was
unsuccessful.
* * * *
“Buttenderry” : An old method of spread-
ing clover and other grasses was to put a handful
of the seed in the neddy’s nose-bag. This ensured
good germination, rapid growth and wide distribution.
With domestic fowls, however, this method will not
work. A fowl’s very thorough digestive processes
result in the complete disintegration of grains, and
subsequent germination is therefore impossible.
Assuming that this applies to all birds, how are
those of Western Queensland supposed to assist in
the spread of prickly-pear ? The quantity of seed
they would carry in their plumage would, I think,
be almost negligible. An offensive has been launched
against emus, magpies and crows; and under the
stimulus of a substantial bonus, these birds are being
slaughtered in thousands. Is it a case of mis-
directed energy?
* * * #
“Nitric”: Tell “Desist” (B. 18/3/’2G),
■who wonders whether his passion-fruit vines get any
nourishment from neighboring acacia-trees, that his
surmise is correct. Acacia roots store nitrogen.
The tree belongs to the Leguminosoe order, of which
peas and.tieans are,members. These plants, including
also clover, lupins and peas, appear to exist in a
kind of partnership with certain bacteria. The bac-
teria live as guests in the nodules and rootlets of
their host, and probably also in the neighboring soil.
The symbiotic bacteria (where symbiisis is defined
as a partnership with mutual benefit) convert the
nitrogen of the atmosphere into a form available as
food for the plants in which they live.
.** * *
“Nikko” : A black marlin, disporting him-
self in the waters round Cape Brett (M.L.), attached
himself to the line of Captain L. D. Mitchell, one of
the Zane Grey company fishing in those waters.
When hauled out of its native element it registered
the astounding weight of 9761 b., and would probably
have recorded over 10001 b. had it been possible to
weigh, it immediately after capture. This is 3151 b.
better than the M.L. official record, and puts Zane
Grey’s world’s record, for a big fish—a tuna caught
by him off Florida —completely in the sardine'class.
“Hartog”: “Gouger” (B. 18/3/’26) gives
instances of his ability to sleep and yet retain his
mental activity. As a slave of the pen, I can say
that his statement is probably true. On many occa-
sions I have gone to sleep while reading a column-
proof in the small hours of the morning, and on
awakening have discovered corrections all the way
down the margin, made by my own hand. The editor
tells me that he makes a practice of falling to
sleep after riting a heading; and I myself have
noticed that many readers do the same thing almost
as soon as they open the rag and get on to the
leading article.
* # * *
“Namoi” : When old Harry was drowned
at the crossing the male section of the town spent
futile hours endeavoring to recover the body. Diving
and dragging operations had been in progress all
day, till the men finally desisted from their efforts
to discuss the pros and cons, of the situation. He
couldn’t be far below the crossing, they agreed;
then why hadn’t they found him? Old Harry’s
stolid son, rolling tobacco between his horny hands,
spat reflectively. “Well, coves,” he said slowly, like
one who weighs his words well, “I reckon, meself,
we oughter be lookin ’up-stream. Yous all know the
contrary ol’ grouser he was!”
ANOTHER DROUGHT VICTIM.
“Fetch me a glass er sherry, young feller.”
“ Yes — dry, sir ?”
“Yes, by cripes I am.”
“Mug Gunner’: I met a weed very similar
to the one “Pick” (B. 18/3/’26) describes—a tough,
spidery growth like a dockweed, with aster-like
blue flowers —in western AHctoria. No one I met
knew its name or address. A',ears later I saw the
same “weed” cultivated in France, and learned tha*
it was chicory.
(Continued on rage 21}.)
THE CIRCUS IN THE YARD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the circus its tents has folded
And stolen away with the morn,
When nothing is left but the sawdust
And the paddock looks drab and forlorn,
When gone are the horses and lions
And the kiddies are taking it hard,
Their sorrow will soon be forgotten
In the circus that plays in the yard.
There’s Jim, in his well-patched pyjamas,
Will clown on a blucher-worn mat;
While Bob, in an old bathing-costume,
Appears as a famed acrobat;
And Clare, her soft hair wreathed in blossoms,
Outshining the deeds of the men,
Will leap on a horse—it is wooden—•
As the daring equestrienne!
Old Rover is billed as the lion—
His bark must be heard as a roar—
And Tabby appears as the tiger
Who longs for the jungles once more.
Oh, many the wonders to thrill them
And many the acts that are starred
When the kiddies have charge of the programme
Of the circus that plays in the yard!
VICTORIA.

AND HIS REVERENCE DIDN’T KNOW.
FATHER O'SHANE : “Ah, you had man! You ought to he ashamed
of yourself, ill-treating your poor defluceless woife like that!”
COUSIN JACK METHODY : “Aw, ded I! An’ what would you do of
your missus gored ’ee a clout ’pon the ’ead ini’ a fryin’-pan?”
“Eureka” : One of the greatest farces out
back is the rabbit-proof fence on the N.S.W.-Queens-
land border. Near Hungerford, and at many other
places along the border, the wind has banked the
earth against the fence on both sides, and rabbits
amuse themselves playing leap-frog over the barrier.
Another popular game is hide-and-seek played in
the burrows under it.
THE DA Y DAD FOUND A FATAL ACCIDENT.
MOTORIST: “Hey, let go! What in the deuce do you think you're doing?”
DAD: “Struth, you’ve given me ther shock of me life! I thought yer was dead!”
“Ller”: Make a point of asking your pup
to afternoon-tea. I have known brass-filings to be
used to cure a dog of distemper, but a neighbor
who has dogs to burn reckons that if given tea to
drink when young a hound will never get distemper.
What h e may get from the tea he didn’t say.
* * * *
“Azac”: A small species of prawn is
known in Lake Illawarra (N.S.W.) as the tiger.
He never grows more than half the size of the king-
prawn, and has a much prettier color-scheme on the
top of his head. Then there is a species intermediate
in size between the tiger and the king. The habits
of the tribe seem to tally in some way with the
phases of the moon.
The Lake Illawarra
prawns “run” to sea
on the outgoing tides
only at night-time, and
only on nights when
’here is no moon. They
do not appear to re-
turn from the sea to
the lake on the in-
coming- tide, though I
understand at Lake
Macquarie they do so.
The few prawns taken
when there is a moon
have no shells, or, at
the most, very soft
shells, so apparently
they shed them about
full-moon. These soft-
shelled prawns cannot
be kept alive when
caught, though the
others -will live for
days with little atten-
tion. At Narooma
(further south) the
empty cases can be
found in heaps piled
on the shore by wind
and tide. During the
time the prawns do
not run they appear to
take shelter in the
sand, and can be found
by digging- on the flats
about 2ft. deep at low
tide, even in the day-
time. The following-
life-cycle for the prawn
seems feasible; that
they breed in the deep
waters of the lake dur-
ing the weeks when
there is a moon in the
sky, and on dark nights
scurry to sea via the
swift tidal channels,
there to provide a banquet for preying fish; whilst
those that miss the way shed their skins (perhaps
after spawning) and then bury themselves.
* * * *
“Cucliulain” : A shipment of darts —the
sort that small boys propel at targets—arrived the
other day in Sydney. The Customs officers fixed
their attention on an entirely innocent-looking lot of
these playthings, each of which bore at the base a
sticky little burr through which the quill of the
feather was thrust. There was no disguise about the
description; they were labelled “Arctium Lappa,” the
scientific name for the burdock, an English burr of
great persistence. The whole consignment was
dropped into the bonfire. Numerous attempts have
been discovered to introduce these pests into the
country in toys—it is not so long since a shipment
of arrows with a similar base of burrs already spread-
ing their little seeds was destroyed. In another
hundred years there will probably be a controversy
about who brought these particular pests to the
country—and there are bound to be several claimants
for the “honor.”
Kitchener”: “Ragar’s” old bushman (B.
4/2/’26) credited emus with a community spirit to
which they are not entitled. Out here on the
Diamantina River (W.-Q.) we find many 1 nests while
mustering, and from 12 to 15 is the average number
of eggs; but, despite that number, I have never
heard of several birds laying in one nest. Mother
lays the eggs and then passes over all responsibility
to father, and a devoted parent he is. P.S.—I know
a lot more about emus’ eggs, and so would you if
your cook fed you on “emu-egg cake” till you felt
as green as their shells.
* * * *
“Trony”: I wonder if in the Abo. Council
there are any tank-sinkers who can help me. Next
summer I propose to put in a drain, 40 chains x 24ft.
wide and 3ft. deep, and would like to get hold of
the most suitable scoop to use, up to four horses,
for the job. I know wheeled scoops are about twice
the cost of a slide scoop, and that’s a consideration.
I have done tons of earth-moving out of deep drains
up to Bft. deep, but could use only the 5-e.f. scoop
and two horses—an Bft. drain takes some climbing.
* * * *
“T T p Top”: Gins and piccaninnies on the
Cape York Peninsula collect the loquat-like nuts of
the zamia plant and roast them. The nuts are
cracked, the shells thrown away, the kernels soaked
in water for five days and then pounded into flour
between stones, and the grit sifted out. The flour
is next put into a basin-shaped dilly-bag near a
running stream. A palm-leaf trough lets a continu-
ous stream of water fall on the flour within the bag,
the flow being carefully regulated so that none
escapes over the lip of the bag. The water con-
tinuously running over-night dissolves the vegetable
poison held in the flour and carries it away. The
residue is dried and can be kept for three days be-
fore being baked into johnny cakes.
“Cuchulain”: Re the pricldy-pear hedge
which was originally planted for ornament (B.
18/3/’2O). Scone was one of the N.S.W. headquarters
for the propagation of the pest, and it was from
here it spread to Bundarra, Keera, and indeed most
of the North-West. Mrs. Mary Ann Sutton introduced
it to Scone in the first place, and afterwards made
presents of it to other settlers in the form of pot-
plants. Her first pot-plant of the weed was flourish-
ing at Scone about 1840-41, and she sent a plant to
Bundarra as early as 1843. More than one noxious
weed has been spread in this way, after being im-
ported as a sentimental reminder of home or because
it “looks nice.”

“Ilobnobster ’: The boss had engaged a
new hand to help us with the harvesting. He hailed
fra Glaskie,” and after tea one night settled down
to give us a few tunes on the pipes. He had not
long started when a red and very excited face,
recognised as that of the man from the adjoining
selection, looked round the kitchen door. “Fer the
love o’ Mike, Jim,” he shouted, “git down to yer
Tamworth sow. Shei must ’ave dropped a litter and
rolled on ’em.”
* * * *
“Jim Carew”: “ Sucre’s ” par (B.
18/3/’26) re the possibility of making “hard stuff”
from Queensland fruit reminds me of an Irishman
who has a place near the border. With the aid
of what he calls a “small Frinch invintion” he
turns out a fine brew from prickly-pear. The liquor
is very like the Mexican metzel, although not quite
so fiery.
“Centurion”: The celery wine sampled by “Sucre”
(B. 18/3/'26) is not an exclusively Queensland product,
but is one of the many beverages which the English-
man’s liking for something with a “kick” in it
led him to evolve when open-air grape-growing and
wine-making departed from England with the monks,
The parsnip, the cowslip, the gooseberry, the elder,
the sloe and many other fruits, flowers and vege-
tables yield the desired stimulant.
“Nitric”: In Queensland I have recently tasted
ttvo efforts at home-distillation, one from pineapples,
the other from persimmons, and both were pleasant
and powerful. Nevertheless, these private stills
should not be dotted about the country. Only
recently an inspector took particulars of all the
distillation apparatus in my laboratory, including
e\en the common retort, whilst a Liebig condenser
was measured from keel to kelson. How is it that,
apparently, the “moonshiners” receive no attention?
* * * *
“Bouragi”; That custom of lifting a new-
comer over the threshold (B. 11/3/’26> is found
all over the earth, and it applies particularly to
brides aniving at 1 the new home for the first time.
Many European races practise the custom, which
used to be common in Scotland and the North of
England. It is undoubtedly a survival of paganism,
like the whorls of blue chalk with which Lancashire
housewives of the humbler sort still decorate their
stone steps or floors, though never a one of them
can say why. Barrenness is the fate of the bride
ignoring the custom. Spirit propitiation, sex magic
and a hundred other theories are advanced by the
wise men as possible reasons for a custom observed,
literally, from China to Peru, and from Papua to
Pmston.
THE DEAD DAYS PAST RECALL.
“Ah, when I think of the lost opportunities
of my young days!”
“Yes, T know—all the beers you didn't drink
when they were threepence a pint.”
“Jimsey”: An unspayed cow belonging to
a -N.S.W. South Coast) dairy-farmer has been
milked continuously for five years and seven months.
Several times she has given symptoms of going dry,
but on each of these occasions the flow of milk has
suddenly increased and returned to normal. She
is a Shorthorn-Jersey and has had only one calf.
PAY-DAY IN MULLOCKVALE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
At four o’clock the whistle blows,
And toilers with the dirt on
Go toddling home to change their clo’es
And put a Sunday shirt on.
Then by and bye both poor and rich,
Delivered from their labors,
Are gathered for a friendly pitch,
And crucify their neighbors.
Here tributors, with accents hurt,
In sombre, sad discussion,
Lament with groans “the blanky dirt
Won’t pay for crimson crushin’
While lucky ones with aspect gay
And feigned preoccupation
Between puffs say, “Hoo-blinkin’-ray,
We’ll buy a bloomin’ station.’’
A tribute is the sort of life
That’s rushed by fools and sages;
For then the prying, curious wife
Can’t tell the old man’s wages.
So they can fill their glasses up.
And drink it down like kisses ;
And when they’ve drained the luring cup
Go home and bluff the missus.
The Salvos bump their noisy drum,
And offer all salvation;
The sinners sunk in beer and rum
They threaten with damnation.
The spieler with his artful tricks
And deft manipulation,
Tries hard some silly dupe to fix
In grievous tribulation.
And in the bar the merry joke,
Of shady reputation,
Is passed around from bloke to bloke
’.Midst boisterous conversation.
“I’ll bet a quid,” “I’ll bet you three,”
“I’ll give you odds, my sonny,”
I often hear, but never see
Them planking down their money.
The last to sleep’s awake the first,
Relieved to find it Sunday;
But, troubled with a powerful thirst,
He dreads the coming Monday.
No more he’ll drink, come drought, come rain,
Should beer flow like a river;
You bet when pay-day comes again
He’ll be as bad as ever.
Those were the days when clanking rod
And cam revolved light-hearted ;
But now alas! ’tis “Ichabod,
The glory has departed.”

“Bill Bowyang”; She was a tall, gaunt
lubra who was visiting a N.-Q. coastal township, and
wished to know if the police sergeant could grant
her a divorce. “What’s your name?” asked the
sergeant. “Oh, my name Lizzie,” replied the lubra,
“an’ I work ’longa Cooraboora Downs.” “Are you
married?” was the next question fired at her. “By
cripes, yes,” grinned Lizzie; “me married to Tommy,
stockman Tonga Cooraboora Downs.” “Well, why
do you want a divorce?” asked the sergeant. ’ “Oli,
you see it this way, sergean’,” whispered Lizzie.
“I don’ think that last-fella piccaninny I been have
belonga Tommy at all. That’s why I wantem
divorce.”

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
SILK
STOCKINGS
The weather this Easter Week has been
a Gloria in excelsis, and the holiday-maker
has inhabited the land in cushy raiment and
reflected the sun dazzlingly from many a
mouthful of porcelain. Teeth—Rand wick
seemed full of teeth this meeting; for when
the punter smiled the bookie gnashed, and
when the bookie raised a smile to Heaven
the stands flashed and clashed like a castanet
band! On the whole, though, the punter
had a merry time, and the Goddess of Chance
threw some rosy apples into the upturned
palm of the girl who took her fancy. Take
the two sisters in the crowd who determined
on a last-minute fly on Murray King. One
at the end of a long queue just managed to
snatch her bit of pasteboard as the window
came down, and then only because the man
in front of her had in sudden fury hurried
from the waiting line. The other sister
was well up in her battle-line when, glancing
back, she spotted one of her new gold-
embroidered gauntlet gloves lying on the grass.
She made a plunge, rescued the glove, but
lost her place, and arrived at the tote win-
dow to have it slammed in her teeth.
Wednesday’s showers did nothing but make
the air silken soft; umbrellas and macs were
mostly parked, and the fur-coat ceased from
troubling. But the newest hat had rest. It
stayed at home with a unanimity that was
both surprising and disappointing. Russian
boots swaggered on three snugly-coated small
creatures; and the big, squashy poet’s bow
and the dear little flat pique collar made
their appearance on a few “slim” suits.
These, accompanied by the flat-heeled shoe
and no jewellery, are as potent as a dip in
the fountain of youth. Amid much natural
pulchritude, Beauty (chemical or soap-and-
w r ater) swooped or rushed, insinuated or
elbowed her way, and man provided a back-
ground of tweeds (lambs in sheep’s clothing),
while the green grass and the clumps of crim-
son and yellow flowers smiled —but, thank
Heaven, they did it without teeth!
, Vice-regals in triplicate were penned again
in the sad-looking enclosure in front of the
band. Blue was splashed heavily over this
area. Of the sky-after-rain blue were the
filmy garments of the G.-G.’s lady. Her hat,
too, was of the heavenly hue, and was Bang-
kok as to straw and wore a feathery mount.
Violet and greens, such as might gambol in
one of Roy de Mestre’s spring scenes, en-
swathed Lady de Chair, and her velvet hat
was moss-green. The W.A. Ex.’s marocains
shone like warm sunlit sands, and the crown
of her black satin hat was high and ostrich-
garnished. Elaine de Chair flew Robin Hood
green, and pierced the brim of her black
velvet hat with a diamond arrow.
The last day of the races brought out sun-
shades and thin frocking. Among the sum-
mery-clad was Lady Stonehaven, in Swiss-
embroidered georgettes, honey-toned, and an
enviable felt hat with mauve water-lilies fall-
ing pensively over the right ear. Black
satins and a glad green feather were the
features of Lady Campion’s attire, while
Mrs. Don Taylor added cheerfulness and
grace to the vice-regal enclosure by frocking
the yellow of an autumn leaf.
Last Friday night the Rose Bay Golf Club
put on the smartest dance of Race Week.
To this came the Governor’s daughter, in
ivory and silver brocades; Macarthur On-
slows ; Mrs. Gordon Caldwell (Eng.), in soft
?T» y ~a . ,n c* • s H^ er * ai ?d Mrs. Edgar Rouse
(Berth), m blue moires, with traceries of
silver. Mrs. Kell was striking in a com-
bination of gold tissue and gold lace ; Mrs.
Alec MacLachlan, more like a Watteau in-
spiration than ever since her hair has gone
white, edged ivory satins with fur; and Miss
Egan, just returned from Europe, was well
in the picture—her first appearance since her
election as president of the associate mem-
bers of the Royal Sydney Golf Club. Every
name that you have read amid the other
race doings can be added, plus that of the
young lordling Hobart, who came with his
Sydney friends, the Granville Waddys. Some
of the frocks at the ball seemed to have no
girl inside of them at all—all the frocks this
winter are going to wear their girls outside.
In spite of cheap sneers at Modern
Woman can any of the Victorian or
Edwardian admirers point to a time when
the ladies of those days took concerted action
to better the conditions of their own sex’
If you were born outside the purple the
worse for you, and you couldn’t expect the
pretty creatures of luxurious homes to
bother about you. To-day never an SOS
from distressed or overburdened sister goes
unheeded. Anyone dropping into the Adyar
Hall during the Conference of the Country
Women’s Association last week must have
been struck by the earnestness with which
the 127 delegates discussed ways and means
to benefit the out-back mother and kiddie.
Bush nursing, maternity wards, seaside
homes, hygiene in schools and such matters
were gravely talked over in a matey fashion,
the ladies on the stage between resolutions
coming forward to its edge and hunching
themselves in small-girl fashion for a rapid
colloquy with someone in the body of the
hall. Personalities of the conference were
Lady de Chair, who opened it; the associa-
tion’s president, Mrs. Studdy; and the new
secretary, Miss Dungey, who appears to
mingle imagination with organising ability.
For three days those delegates from every
part of the State planned the new year’s
campaign, and the casual dropper-in gath-
ered the impression that, woman to woman,
the good old days had been replaced by the
better new ones.
Her Ex. gathered in the C.W.A. Confer-
ence for a tea-drinking at State Government
House midway through the week. As the
party and a race-meeting clashed, four o’clock
was the trysting hour; thus Lady de Chair
and Elaine were able to have their cake and
eat it, too—they did most of the races apd
got back in time to greet the first guest with
an unruffled brow. The vice-reine wore her
race frock of violet and green shaded by a
moss-green velvet hat. Elaine and Lady
Champion, who helped to do the honors,
dressed this act as they had the vice-regal
pen at Randwick, and wore bottle-green and
fawn georgettes respectively.
General Rain and the battalions of his
shining spears that had swept drought from
the land were the toast of the Thanksgiving
Ball at the Wentworth. The Country
Women had named the one jazz frivol of the
conference week. The ballroom of the Went-
worth masqueraded as a hall of agriculture
dressed in sheaves of wheat, cobs of corn and
clumps of sugar-cane; and in this jolly-
shepherd atmosphere the polka and the old-
fashioned waltz were danced with a zip rare
to the dance-floors of to-day. Mrs. Matt
Sawyer, of Bethungra, president of the ball
committee, wearing rhinestone embroideries
on her black georgettes, signed checks for
one of the evening’s biggest parties, and Mrs.
Otway Falkiner, another hostess, was
wrapped in old-rose marocains. Among
others who brought large parties were the
Hugh Hamiltons (Melbourne), Mrs. H. C.
Mclntyre, Mrs. Mariner (Young) and Mrs.
Ernest Norton (Armidale).
In the palmy days of spectacular drama
Bland Holt had a pair of good-lookers in
Frances Ross
and Harrie
Ireland, one
wearing a
crown of rich
red gold, the
other raven-
locked. Fran-
ces Ross, who
died last
week, was a
Maorila n d e r
whose talents
attracted the
notice of Rob-
ert Brough
and led to her
appear ance
with the
Brough - Bou-
cicault co. On
the actor’s
advice she
went to Lon-
don, and scored
success in Shakspearean productions; but a
venture of her own in Shakspeare on an
Australasian tour failed. It was then that she
joined up witli Bland Holt; and the little
picture herewith was taken in those good
days. When the Holt company disbanded
Frances Ross set up her plate as a teacher
of dramatic art in Sydney, and she kept her
elocution going until her health broke down
some time ago.
The dinner-dance in aid of Furlough
House—the holiday home for soldiers’ wives
and kiddies—filled the Ambassadors with the
best dresses of the season. The G.-G. Stone-
havens having issued commands for a knife-
and-fork review at Admiralty House that
same evening, some of the highest only
arrived at the Ambassadors in time for
supper. With nine o’clock came the State
Exes., served with the National Anthem.
Lady Champion took the salute with them,
and surrounded by the ex-Premier George
Fullers, the Naval-Commander Robins couple
and the Spencer Brunton and R. C. Wilkin-
son matrons, they adorned a vice-regal dais
that was further embellished by Aide Max
Coote. All green and gold like an Irish
Free Stater was Lady de Chair in her vel-
vets patterned with gold leaves. Her orange
fan, though, would have cheered the heart
of Mr. Ness.
Members of the Queen’s Club put on their
smartest for the reception in honor of Lady
Stonehaven, though the vice-regal guest
wore a hat as unobtrusive as the lady
herself. At least two Ascot frocks made an
appearance. These were worn by Mrs.
Albert Littlejohn and Miss Agnes William-
son. Mrs. Littlejohn’s was built of black
and white, and topped by a hat that looked
like a coronet of upstanding black ospreys.
Miss Williamson shaded her beige lace and
georgette with a large drooping hat of the
same shade —reminiscent of the early-Vic-
torian “poke.” It wrnre a tuft of ostrich
feathers at. the side in water-color shades
of blue mauve and pink. The Cullen lady,
much plumper, was welcomed back, and the
president of the club, Miss Macarthur On-
slow, and the Chief Justice Knox and Philip
Street ladies, together with official and social
somebodies, constituted the vice-regal body-
guard.
Hfere you see one of Sydney’s most sym-
pathetic accompanists—Joan Fry, a younger
member of a
well - known
North Shore
family. For
some years her
labor of love
was her piano
work with the
Sydney Choral
Society, and
she has ap-
peared as con-
cert support to
most of Syd-
ney’s vocal
stars. Of late
she has been
giving more
time to solo-
playing, and
in the studio
of St. Quintin
Downer has
rounded off
that talent
which had already w r on her a three-years’
scholarship at the Conservatorium. Now
she faces study with Tobias Matthay in
London, playing her farewell to Sydney at
the Con. on the 17th. Judith Fletcher made
this picture of her.
H.M.A.S. Sydney was flung open by Cap-
tain Boyes by way of Easter greeting to
the stalwarts of H.M.S. Delhi, of Victoria
Barracks and of George’s Heights. About 200
dancers took to the shining deck, Mrs. Boyes
hostessing in pale-pink hand-painted chiffons.
The Viking’s daughter Elaine preferred the
dance in a warship to any other offering of
the night; and indeed every social lambkin
of the Harbor City frolicked amid the colored
spotlights and the bunting that blurred the
beauty of a night soft with rain.
The alluring London mannequin, Mary
Mackenzie Young, who married into the Bri-
tish peerage, pianissimo, a few weeks ago. is
an Australian lass whose mother caused a
stir in Sydney society years ago. The bride-
groom in the case is Robin Grant, a son of
Lady Sybil Grant, Lord Rosebery’s daughter.
The couple, who were married at a handy
registrar’s office in London, kept their roman-
tic secret a fortnight; she went back to wear
creations for her West End dressmaking firm
before the ring was warm on her hand, while
her Robin returned to barracks. The bride
is a daughter of the late Captain Telford
Mackenzie Young, and a grand-daughter of
the late General French, a former State Com-
mandant. Her mother was married twice,
forsaking the widowhood of Captain Mac-
kenzie Young for matrimony with William
Herbert Wood, a prominent N.S.W. politi-
cian. Mrs. Wood was one of Sydney’s pretty
and popular women. England swallowed
her up some years ago, but this stir has
swept her to the surface again.
How the lure of Sydney holds those who
have once been in exile! Singer Charles
Rolfe is now hurrying back to Fogland, after
stretching what was to have been a two-
months’ holiday into nearly five, the spur
being a cable from his London concert agents
wanting to know how long they were to
apologise for his absence from engagements.
But Rolfe intends to return in 12 months
for the purpose of organising a concert
party on original lines to tour Australasia:
he feels that he can’t stand more than a
year’s absence.
The wrinkles of St. Paul’s within the Uni.
will be massaged by Youth on Saturday,
when gowned undergrads and shingled
maidens will pursue lucre, filthy and other-
wise. Their efforts are in aid of St. Paul’s
building and oval fund, and their brigand-
age wall wear the mask of a fair. The State
Ex. and his lady will start it at 2.30. The
dining-hall has been set apart for dancing.
In order to avoid clashing with the G.P.S.
boat-race on May 1, University women have
now arranged to hold their fete in aid of
their new Settlement House (17 Edward-
street, Redfern) on Saturday, April 24, at
the conclusion of the annual graduation cere-
mony. Lady de Chair W’ill declare the fete
open and be accompanied by the Governor,
and the Chancellor (ex-C.J. Cullen) will
preside. The attractions include a play to
be presented by Don Finley, a concert
arranged by Mowat Carter, lightning sketches
by such well-known artists as Souter, Collins
and Bancks, and many sideshows.
The English-Speaking Unionists have
learned to mingle business with pleasure, and
at the meetings for their ball in celebration
of Shakspeare’s birthday they always have
a lion to roar for their entertainment. East
week elocutionist Harry Thomas explained
the subtleties of “Julius Caesar,” and later
did Mark Antony’s oration over the body of
the dead tealeaf. April 23 is the date of
the ball at the Ambassadors.
St. James’s wore quite a prideful air one
sapphire night last week when Josephine
Watson trailed her wedding finery down its
aisles. The bride, one of Su'mmer Hill’s
popular girls, kept her date with John Mc-
Neill Simpson, of Hay, in ivory satins,
silver-plated where not frosted with pearl
and diamente. The train was a Moonlight
Sonata of embossed ninon, and a full com-
plement of tulle veiling moored by a coronet
of crystal and pearl is being quoted wherever
engaged girls are gathered together. Bride's
sisters Florence and Jean ’maided in taffetas
shot to represent a sunset of rose and gold.
The dining-room in the Feminist Club
started its new career as a cafe for the
benefit of the T.B. soldier and sailor on
Monday night. The opening function was
a reception to the Country Women Con-
ferrers, and the assembly- and dining-rooms
were a yellow haze of chrysanthemums and
dahlias —a kind of floral intimation of the
cafe’s name, the Golden Shower.
Four Beethoven Sonatas for piano and
violin were the offering of Moore MacMalion
and Wilfred Arlom on the altar of their In-
spiration last week. These musicians have
planned to give the 10 sonatas written by
the Old Master for piano and violin, and
it’s to be hoped larger audiences will greet
the second and third recitals. The first pro-
gramme was representative of the composer’s
early manhood. Flowing rhythm and direct
charm were their characteristics, with an
irrepressible happiness bubbling through all.
The next concert will be on June 9.
To keep the home-fires burning at the
Horses’ Retreat and the Dogs’ Home, the
S.P.C.A. will launch a Be-kind-to-animals
week on April 19: G.-G. Stonehaven and his
lady will give it a push-off from the Town
Hall. From the 19th till the 24th dances,
fetes and gymkhanas will rage in the city
and in different country towns. The final
burst will be on Saturday, when Miss Eadith
Walker’s grounds of Yaralla, at Concord,
will be the setting for a pastoral play and
fair. Lady Stonehaven has promised to act
as the Queen Bee on the occasion.
Miss Brisbane’s varied reminiscences:—
Guy Bates Post has stormed Brisbane with his
“Bad Man,” and his houses have been enthusiastic
as well as big. A gold horseshoe was presented to
the Mexican Lopez after the first performance, and
Eileen Sparkes and Cecil Haines were handed much
vegetable produce.
Easter Monday races were held at Ascot under
blue skies, and there were heaps of green frocks on
the lawn. Mrs. Stanley Chapman’s was of pussy-
willow ; young Mrs. Jardine, from Stanthorpe, was
in blue and amber; Kathleen Hirschfeld wore sage-
green with grey fox. The Glynn Connollys, Brooke
Kellys, E. T. Reald and Bebe Bulcoek were amongst
others who caught the eye on the lawn. Mrs. Isaac
Moore and Mrs. J. D. Henderson had parties on the
committee-room verandah.
Griffiths lent the new tea-rooms in their Queen-
street basement for the benefit arranged by Mrs. Ted
Theodore for the Sick Children’s Hospital. A number
of artists from Bohemia and the Empire gave con-
tributions to the musical programme, Enid Parker
played the violin, and Vera Benson was amongst
the singers. Roses and gerberas adorned the tea-
tables.
Lila Howard had a party for bride-elect Zoe
Sparkes at her Eagle Junction home. Roses and
gerberas backgrounded the ivory crepe-de-Chine
frock of the guest of honor, who is marrying Errol
Campbell soon.
William Macfarlane, son of the J. P. Macfarlanes,
of Cranberry, took Moya Crozier for keeps in the
Valley kirk, the bride wearing white satin opalesque
with silver lace and pearl and marabout ’broideries
and carrying pink and white roses. Mrs. B. Linsley
lent the veil of Honiton lace. Doris Crozier, in
mauve, ’maided; she wore a coral-tinted veil and
carried a posy of mauve and pink.
Easter was wet, on the whole, and hundreds of
motor-cars were marooned betwixt Brisbane and the
Tweed. Dodging the showers, a large crowd paraded
the Ascot lawns, mostly in jumper suits, for the
Easter Monday races. Mrs. Isaac Moore had a tea-
party on the committee verandah. Mrs. Blackman
sported a pink and blue crepe de Chine; Mrs. Bob
Cowlishaw blue and apricot, Madge Cullen nigger,
Mrs. Fred Wharton (from Sydney) grey, and Mrs.
Jack Jackson biscuit-color.
Kathleen Hirschfeld had a party at Rowe’s to fare-
well Madoline Clark, of the G. B. Post company,
who has gone on to Melbourne. Amongst the god-
speeders were the Stanley Chapman, Otto Hirschfeld,
Clarke, G. Moran and Leslie Gall matrons. Others
there were Eileen Sparkes, Cecil Haines and pretty
Jean Athol (who was here with Allan Wilkie and is
now w’ith “The Bad Man”), Gladys Pollard and
Mervyn Jones. Press-women also gathered at Lennon’s
to give the glad hand to Madoline. She goes
to IJ.S.A. with the company.

Tlie secret of the inimitable artistry of the Wurlitzer Player Piano lies not only in its glorious
tonal beauty, nor yet in its perfect mechanical construction but rather in a combination ol
just these two features. The capability of this instrument to play EXPRESSI VEL/x is
wonderful, and so simple and effective are the controls that it requires but little practice tor
those who are not used to a player piano to become remarkably efficient.
Made by the Rudolf Wurlitzer Mfg. Co., N.Y.—builders of the celebrated
orchestral organs installed at the Prince Edward Theatre, Sydney; Arcadia
Theatre, Chatswood; Winter Garden Theatre, Brisbane; and the Capitol
Theatre, Melbourne.
Any of the following music stores will be glad to demonstrate the Wurlitzer to anyone interested:

MISSESE MONKE DOVLE
Phones central 1532, 1533.
Melbourne’s farewell to the Stradbrokes
was a wonderful thing to witness, and the
oldest inhabitant, peering into the uttermost
recesses of time, couldn’t recall a vice-regal
good-bye like it. Young and old, rich and
poor, turned out to bid the popular pair
“God-speed.” Spencer-street station pre-
sented a slice of society in which Jack was
even better than his master, and the upper
strata got bumped and pushed out of place
without showing any resentment. Apart
from the Stradbrokes, the crowd took most
interest ;in the tableau provided in the
station-yard by the guard of honor provided
by the Lancers, with red-and-white pennons,
and the mounted police on their white horses.
The vice-regal chariot, with its blue-and-gold
liveried postilions, was also much liked.
The Stradbroke hands were shaken by
thousands, and whole gardens-full of flowers
were passed over to the Countess, aides stack-
ing them in the special car which had received
an extra polish for the occasion.
When the curtain rose at His Majesty’s
the other night some of the glamor of the
“Don Quixote” ballet communicated itself
at once to the crowded audience, which
loudly showed approval of the glowing life
and color of the scene. Toreadors waved
varied-hwed scarves, and gay signorinas
whirled to mad music and the clinking of
castanets. Into the gay throng dashed
Anna Pavlova, the heroine, with arabesques
of black upon white flounces, and her lithe
body swathed in a rust-red Spanish shawl.
Later glittering sequins and gold tulle
formed a frame for her shapely silk-clad
limbs. From the bustle and gaudy dressing
of the market-place of Barcelona there was
a transformation to an enchanted wood,
with dainty sprites in white headed by a
lass in leaf-green. Anna herself was a
fountain of white tulle flowing from a sheath
of silver. The quaint Don Quixote strode
stately and slow among the flitting figures
or rode upon a well-trained and docile Rosin-
ante. Sancho Panza's donkey, late of the
cast of “Wildflower,” showed no elation at
his rise from musical comedy to Russian
ballet. The third part of the programme
saw Anna in the plumage and tulle of the
departing swan and a Russian garb of futur-
ist mode. Grecian tunics of pastel line
covered seven attractive maidens, and 'a
Chinese ballet and a mazourka in Russian
gala dress rang further changes upon the
earlier programmes.
Dame Clara and Kennerley Rumford,
looking very fit after their Maoriland tour,
got a warm welcome from a big audience at
the Exhibition Building. The world’s biggest
contralto was wrapped in cloth of silver with
jewelled corsage adornment in jade, blue and
brilliants, and a long tasselled fringe. Pian-
ist Marie Aussenac, who has climbed in Mel-
bourne’s estimation since she became a
princess by marriage, had fur bordering her
knee-lengtli gold-tissue frock, with a yoke
arrangement of pearl beads. Ethel Osborn,
the Bananaland singer whose light soprano
notes have been tutored by Roland Foster at
the Sydney Con., made her bow in a frock
of gold lace and black velvet. The horticul-
tural contraptions handed up were most
elaborate, baskets and sheafs being supple-
mented by stands of dahlias for the spacious
Butt lady, while the Princess, whose bril-
liant technique was displayed upon a piano-
forte that was quite unworthy of her, col-
lected a stage-property-looking crown set
upon a blue velvet cushion, a harp, lyre and
other touching symbols.
Dame Clara’s farewells were sung in
draperies of Parma-violet satin and crystal,
the. usual additional few yards of material
trailing over the stage. and blending nicely
with the floral offerings. Madame and her
husband will sing at Adelaide and Perth
on their homeward way. They paid their
tribute to Pavlova here one evening, and
tumbled some pretty flowers from their box
to the feet of the fair Russian, the audience
being duly impressed.
Geelong Lawn Tennis Club’s annual tourna-
ment attracted so many entries that the courts
of the Corio Club and the Hermitage had
to be included in the battleground. Bud-
ding Lenglens, as usual, wore trim, plain
■white frocks, with only occasionally a dash
of embroidery to beautify the severe attire
prescribed by custom, but hats of bright
hues were the order of the day. Club-presi-
dent C. C. Cox’s lady was an onlooker in
tomato-red felt headpiece and black crepe-
de-Chine gown. Lorna Cox, who swung a
racquet, wore a biscuit-hued hat with her
ivory silk apparel. Mrs. R. R. Vincent had
a powder-blue and white gown showing be-
neath a black coat. Mrs. Gerald Patterson,
clothed in magpie gown and millinery,
watched her husband's play. On Easter Eve
there was a smart hop at the local golf club-
house to help finance the making of tennis-
courts there.
Rain halted play in the tennis tournament
for a time, but there were players keen
enough to fight their sets to the bitter end
on a splashing wet court. The tennis dance
was acclaimed as one of the best the club
ever had. Lorna Cox and A. A. Gray, the
stage-managers, converted St. Mary’s Hall
into a fairyland in which palms, balloons
and draperies were woven into harmonies
of orange and gold.
The Alliance Frangaise waved farewell
to the Consul for France and Mrs. Turck,
off for a holiday visit to La Belle France,
at a soiree at No. 9. President Mrs. Dyer,
apparelled in butterfly blue brocade, handed
the lady a posy of rare blossoms, and gave
Monsieur a cigar-box of Australian black-
wood. The Consulates were largely repre-
sented, the troubles' of 1914-18 being laid
with yesterday’s seven thousand years., The
Turck matron’s fair shingle blended in with
a gold lace and tissue gown, and Mrs. Gros-
sardi, whose husband is Italy’s handsome
representative, had petunia pink tulle jutting
from a black-sequined robe. Leonard Mer-
rick’s daughter Lesley sported grey fur upon
the flarings of her pink georgette and gold
lace frock.
Novelist Leonard Merrick, who has been
sampling the atmosphere of Macedon from
the Golf House, evidently finds Victoria
much to his liking, for he and his daughter
Lesley have joined the flat-dwellers at
Myoora, Toorak.
Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, wearing dull silver
gleaming upon saxe-blue, put on an Austra-
lian composers’ programme at Kinnoul the
other night. Guests, chiefly members of the
British Music Society, listened easily to
numbers that were almost entirely free from
the dissonances and unrestfulness of the
ultra-modern school. A mystic glow from
green candles in silver branched candlesticks
helped to create an atmosphere of repose.
Piano compositions presented were by Percy
Grainger, Roy Agnew, S. St. Leger Burton
and Linda Phillips, played by Maisie Thom-
son, Eileen St. Leger and Linda Phillips
(Mrs. Maurice Kauffmann). Three short
songs and a trio of shorter “impressions” by
Arthur Benjamin, warbled by Viola Morris,
took the evening’s honors—charming efforts,
all of them. Some Maori songs by William
James were well sung by his attractive
young Slav wife. Soprano Lilian Stott was
heard, too, in a group of Fritz Hart’s vocal
arrangements of mad William Blake’s verses.
In place of the much-looked-forward-to Bardic
Ode by Mona Mcßurney, cancelled through
the illness of tenor Sydney Mannering, basso
Robert Raff raised liis voice in a colorful,
dashing excerpt from this brilliant com-
poser’s opera, “The Dalmatian.”
Things are looking a little bit more hope-
ful for Australian musicians this year, in
spite of an
influx of many
oversea stars.
One of the first
luminaries to

pianist - com-

G. James, of

staff, who
hails from
Ballarat. The

looking young
man here pic-
tured has just
passed his
30th milestone.
He gets hi s
talent from
hi s mother,
who guided his early efforts at the keyboard.’
At the University Con. he won a three-years’
scholarship and honors in composition. Later,
in England, he studied with Dr. Arthur
(ireef.. As solo pianist he toured the British
Isles in connection with the international
celebrity subscription concerts; and many
fine compositions, including “Six Australian
Bush Songs,” “The Sun God” and a ballet,
‘Candle Light,” performed at the Savoy
Theatre, have won for him generous recog-
nition abroad. Mr. James married, in 1921
or thereabout, Saffo Arnav, an operatic so-
prano who gained in Milan the Verdi schol-
arship.
In honor of daughter Edyth’s approaching
wedding Mr and Mrs. A. S. Pie flung wide
the door of Tulloki, East Malvern, and a gay
crowd swarmed in. Mrs. Pie welcomed her

Mrs. E. Ramsay brought her son John, the
prospective bridegroom. Also there were the
three pretty maids-to-be, Gwen and Joyce
Thomas and Jean Pie.
The vicar of Gisborne and Macedon, 0. G.
Bright Parker, has taken unto himself a
wife, Kathleen Harley Wainwright, second
daughter of the W. E. Wainwrights, of Gaul-
held. Archgaiters Lees gave a master-twitch
to the knot at Trinity College Chapel, Park-
ville. A veil of Venetian point lace added
richness to the bride’s cream-satin gown,
gold-embroidered, and a trio of attendant
’maids carrying pink roses and delphiniums
formed an attractive background in shaded
blue frocks and velvet millinery of the right

In case anyone doesn’t know, or is in
danger of forgetting, there are 700 sick and
wounded soldiers in this community who stand
in need of such winter comforts as knitted
pull-over sweaters. The staunch and sturdy
pliers of purl and plain might write to Red
Cross headquarters, 42-46 Latrobe-street, for
the formula for making the garments. It
has been customary, in late years, to earmark
a sum of money for this purpose, but this
year the Red Cross council proposes that the
goods shall be donated by the knitters, thus
saving Red Cross funds.
Merric Boyd, whose pottery has been in
the limelight in Victoria, is here found facing
a Broothorn
camera. He
started the
attempt to
earn a living
by running a
dairy - farm,
but found
ministering to
Stra w b e r r y
was not his
forte. He then
took up sculp-
ture at the
Gallery, later
forsaking that
art for pottery.
His father and
mother are art-
ists, too, and
his brother
Penleigh, who
was killed a
couple of years
ago, reached
high achievement as a landscape-painter.
Another brother, Martin, has blossomed into
an author; his first novel, “Love Gods,”
which he wrote under the nom de plume
of Martin Mills, made quite a stir in Eng-
land, where he is now engaged on a third.
There is a sample of Merric’s work in the
Sydney. National Gallery, but he is unrepre-
sented in the Melbourne Gallery, which has
no art-crafts section. The omission is one
that ought to be rectified.
There were cocktails and tea in the foyer
of the Princess Theatre on Friday afternoon
when Knight Benjamin Fuller, brother John
and Hugh Ward bade the women journalists
and the principals of the “Mercenary Mary”
co. fraternise. Over the tablecloths Hugh
J. said a word in favor of the new show and
the players, most of whom spoke their piece
too, which mainly boiled down to “Glad to
be here.”
Kindly-disposed folk are reminded that to-
morrow afternoon and evening there will be
entertainment at the lately-completed After-
Care Home of the District Nursing Society,
the object being to gather up coin for the
furnishing of the building.
John R. Clarke, of the clerical staff of
the State Treasury Department, has taken
a wife, Mrs. Edith Poison, whose first hus-
band was killed in the Great Scrap. She is
a sister of journalists Syd and W. R. Pratt,
and has been for a few years in the War
Service Homes Office here.
Carmen Pascova has taken her staging
talents back to London after saying good-bye
to her old friends at the Lyceum Club. The
singer, in gown of jade-green hue, mucli-
fringed, with her sister Mrs. Finlay in black
and silver, gave the glad hand to a gathering
representative of Melbourne’s musical and
artistic world. Mrs. Arthur Streeton brought
her violin to entertain the company, and the
hostesses contributed their quota of song.
Youth, undeterred by the rain, tripped
gaily at the Kooyong Clubhouse on Satur-
day evening, when the Lawn Tennis Asso-
ciation had one of its nights out. Gwen
Bedggood, who arranged the floral decorative
scheme, was arrayed in flame georgette, bor-
dered at the hem-line with velvet roses.
The Miller family in Ballarat is proudly
showing a letter received from Rita Miller,
a former songbird of the J. C. Williamson
Opera Co., now in Milan. Foreign voice
experts having confirmed local opinion, Rita
has settled down in Milan for a long spell
of hard work with Bavagnoli. Her first
operatic study role will be Mimi in “La
Bohfeme.”
Choristers of Geelong Grammar School
sang “The Voice that Breathed” with gusto
at the marriage of Harold Radcliffe Scott,
one of their masters, and Freda Marcell
Douglass in the school chapel. Throngs of
Grammarians and local and Western district
folk packed into the premises. The lady’s
father is the proprietor of the Geelong
Advertiser, and the family is of long stand-
ing in the go-ahead town where the Eliza-
beths are put together. The bride’s raiment
of white and silver was canopied by her
mother’s wedding veil. For the honeymoon the
happy couple are to go visiting the ’groom’s
parents, Canon and Mrs. C- H. Scott, of
Lincoln (Eng.), and they expect to reside
permanently in the Dole Country.
Mai Bacon, the vivacious lady who is Mer-
cenary Mary at the Princess, is one of the
few mummers of her sex who have submitted
to the tattooer. A butterfly which looks like
a bruise from the idle side of the footlights
spreads its wings upon her plump lily-white
arm midway between shoulder and elbow. It
isn’t - pretty.
Some people make no allowances for the
artistic temperament. The other evening
there was a theatrical party in a smart flat-
tery. A very vivacious musical-comedy star
who was there considered that a marble
bust of Bill Shakspeare in the hall didn’t do
justice to the deceased. Commandeering her
hostess’s grease-paints, she gave William a
full make-up, and stuck a cigarette between
his cold lips. Next morning an infuriated
landlord bade his perfectly innocent tenant
gaze on the result —and told her to quit.
The modern-language masters and misses
are booked for busier days and nights as
wireless grows, for the world’s Babel of
tongues is complicating matters in the ether.
A radio experimenter here raised a man in
Italy the other midnight and sent the country-
man of Mussolini some words of greet-
ing Sn the Latin tongue culled from an old
schoolbook. The delighted Dago forthwith
poured out a stream of resounding Italian
sibilants. The other managed to let his new
friend know that that was no good, and then
the communicants stumbled along on some
remembered remnants of school French.
Members of the Uni. Con. Past Students’
Association coo-eed Professor Laver to come
in from his farm among the hills and collect
an easy-chair and a reading-stand that they
wished to give him as a remembrance. In-
cidentally, the staff, headed by ’cellist Louis
I-lattenbach, presented the ex-Ormond Pro-
fessor with his portrait from George Bell's
brush ; but at his request this remains in the
keeping of the Con. It will be given a place
of honor among the notable musicians whose
portraits hang in Melba Hall.
Some of our own local talent are endeavor-
ing to be heard above the clatter of the pub-
licity given to various imported stars.
Maisie Thomson, a pianist of much ability,
puts on a programme at the Assembly Hall
on May 10 which has interesting features.
Sister Adelaide’s chronicle :
The drought held for Easter, and nearly 7000
motors stirred the roads that wind through the
hills to Oakbank. But it was a Heaven-sent day—or
would have been in any other season; now it needs
a two-inch rain to stir us to so ecstatic an adjective
—cool with a cloud-flecked sky and a hint of autumn
in the air. The committee claims a record attendance,
but as the meeting grows in popularity it loses
something in character, and each year sees a smaller
number of one-time familiar faces. Feminine dress-
ing, of dust, resolved itself mostly into
tailored tweeds and the jumper suit. Hats were
snug, and shoes, many of them, of the sandal and
open-work variety.
From racing we swung to polo—a week of tourna-
ments that settled the fate of the Cudmore and
Melrose Cups and ended with a tournament that is
in full swing. The Bridges went down once or twice
to cast an appreciative eye on the play, and there
was an imposing array of motors in the reserve.
The supper-dance was staged in the Osborne Hall —
all autumn leaves and gay balloons and streamers
that mingled the colors of the competing teams.
There was some smart frocking—notably that of two
younger matrons whose husbands are keen players—
and some weird. A committee of half a dozen —
Mrs. Barritt, Mrs. G. Braund, Mrs. Darby and Mrs.
G. Law Smith its feminine components—ran the
affair, and has the right to pat itself enthusiastically.
This State has a special interest in the Gilbert
and Sullivan eo., for the cast includes Lois Lathlean,
daughter of Mrs. R. H. Lathlean, who is making her
first step in a stage career as one of the chorus.
She has been at Melbourne Con. for the last couple
of years, and to a fresh and musical voice adds
personality.
S’Langdon Bonython, who sent a cheque for £lOOO
to the St. Peter’s Cathedral Fund in its early days
and earmarked it for choir stalls, has now offered
to pay as well for the bishop’s and dean and chapter
stalls, with canopies complete. Walter Bagot, who
was architect for the Roman Catholic Cathedral, is
to design them.
There died at the end of the week, after a long
illness, Mrs. E. O. lvelsey, for many years head-
mistress of Dryborough House School for Girls, one
of the best known in the State, which was started
by her mother, Mrs. W. Harcus, way back in the
very early days. Teaching apart, art and literature
were her hobbies.
The R.C. Cathedral has at last been completed,
except for a 200-feet tower, which remains for the
future. The old structure standing back from Wake-
field-street has now been brought forward with an
imposing front to that thoroughfare, and the opening
ceremony takes place this week. The work has
taken nearly three years, and cost about £50,000.

NOTIONS
Valicare has entered upon a well-deserved
holiday with her record still unstained by defeat.
In the All-aged Stakes at Randwick she handsomely
accounted for Top Gallant, The Night Patrol, Metellus
and Fuji San at Weight-for-age, running the mile
on a pretty heavy track-—it rained for nearly an
hour before the race—in lmin. 40jsec. Only Top
Gallant, who looked a bit above himself (appearances
are sometimes deceptive in the case of these English
horses), made a race of it with her, and she had
his measure a furlong from home. The Valais —
Courante bay has been pronounced “better than
Wakeful.” She is probably as brilliant up to a
mile and a furlong, which is the farthest she has
yet travelled ; but she will have to shine as a stayer
before she can be accepted as superior, or even
equal, to the great mare who won the Sydney Cup
with 9st. 71b., and ran second in the Melbourne
Cup with 10st., conceding 3st. 6lb. to a really
first-class three-vear-old in Lord Cardigan. Whether
she is a stayer or not will be proved, barring
accidents, next season ; but, with her beautifully easy
action and strong finish, she should certainly be as
capable of galloping 12 furlongs as Beauford, who
won the A.J.C. Spring Stakes, beating Gloaming, in
2min. 3*31 sec.
Windbag is also to to be spelled for a couple of
months in a paddock. He was beaten by Heroic in
the Cumberland Stakes, after the four runners had
dawdled over the first half-mile —< it took the
winner 3min. 7sec. to get to the end of 14
furlongs, whereas the next race, a 13-furlong handi-
cap, was run in 2min. 491-sec. —but he turned the
tables in the A.J.C. Plate, 2} miles, in which the
pace was on for about If miles —the full distance
occupied 4min. 2sec. Windbag had to survive a pro-
test on the ground that Munro had taken him to the
rails, in Heroic’s track, before he was the regula-
tion two lengths ahead. The crossing was palpable,
but the stewards decided that it was legitimate:
certainly it made no difference to the result, even
though Windbag, loafing (as usual) when he hit the
front a furlong or so from the finish, allowed Heroic
to get within half a length of him. Botli fit and
well, the bay is clearly a better stayer than the
chestnut. The latter, however, atoned for his unsatis-
factory performances at Randwick a year ago, and
Sydney now acknowledges that he is an uncommonly
good horse. The dispiriting spectacle of David
toiling vainly to keep up with horses that were
running in yearling' paddocks when he was in his
racing prime was witnessed on all four days. If
the wealthy owner is not sportsman enough to
retire the old horse from the turf on which he
lingers superfluous, the A.J.C. should take a hand
and refuse David’s nomination.
Pilliewinkie failed badly during the round, and
will probably do his future racing in Victoria
—Scobie is of opinion that he doesn’t care for Rand-
wick. On the other hand, Pantheon, tried in the
Dangar Handicap, 12 furlongs, with 9st. 61b., beat
a big field in a style which suggests that he is
a natural stayer, and that if he had been reserved
for long-distance handicaps (it may be too late now)
instead of chasing Valicare, The Night Patrol and
co., he would have done a lot better. The fine-looking
English horse, who went out at 7 to 2, was one of
three favorites to win handicaps during a round
which McShortodds will remember with joy, and
there wer e 19 handicaps altogether, jumping races in-
cluded. He is owned by J. E. and C. H. Brien, who
collected £4246 of the £52,786 distributed by the
A.J.C., and would have easily headed the list, instead
of E. J. Gorman and T. J. Gaffney, owners of Murray
King (they shared £5385), had Rampion jumped off
with the field in the Sires’ Produce Stakes, which
was worth £5044 to Mrs. M. L. Falkiner, owner of
Cyden. In the Champagne Stakes the handsome Roe-
sendale—Royal Pet colt proved easily the best of the
two-year-oids, and he will certainly be the next
Derby favorite if he winters well. Cromwell
(Woorak-Meitlesome), Royal Tea (Tea Tray—Duchess
Eudorus), Vallino (Valais —Carthona) and Count
Richmond (Richmond Main —Accepted Countess)
also promise to be good.
Apart from Pantheon, Johnnie Jones, who won
the City Handicap, 13 funongs, made the most
abiding impression among the handicap horses. He
is owned and trained by a pig-and-poultry farmer,
who has a Metropolitan neddy in the plain but
very useful Beragoon—Lady Bon Ami gelding if he
doesn’t over-race him as Valamita was over-raced.
Munro, with six wills to his credit, was easily the
most successful jockey, and Williams led among the
trainers. Secretary Cropper handled the arrange-
ments with his customary ability, and if he could
persuade the committee to cut out the steeplechases,
in the second of which a horse was killed and two
jockeys were badly knocked about, the public, which
does not relish these spectacles, would be sufficiently
grateful.

There was a rush to buy Valais yearlings
at the Sydney sales, 10 lots averaging 2430 guineas.
E. M. Pearce, the Victorian, paid 5500 guineas for
the brother to Valicare, a bay, like the filly ; Moss,
the Sydney punter, went to 4100 guineas for the
Galtee Queen colt, a brother to the disappointing
Vaals; and Belgamba’s half-brother realised 3800
guineas—W. Kelso bought him on behalf of the aged
McCaughey, owner of Mmjerookah and brother of
the fine old man who remembered the Diggers in his
will. The Rossendales and some of the Magpies
also fetched high prices; Rampion’s sister was
knocked down to P. H. Osborne, who owns Valicare,
for 1500 guineas. But in other eases prices were on
the low side. Thanks to the irrational prejudice
against the progeny of Australian-bred stallions, you
could buy 10 Greensteads for what a sister to
Valwvne (Valais —Beanbri) brought. One wouldn’t
mind betting that the 10 Greensteads will win a
lot more stake money.

The first three races at Aspendale Park
(Vic.) on Saturday provided very tight finishes, but
in the Aspendale Handicap, for which Sir Dighlock
was a 7-to-4 favorite, Who’s Mistake (20), taking
charge below the distance, won in very easy fashion
by 27, lengths from the fast-finishing Batteryman
(8 to 1), with Anton Rain (6 to 1) three parts of
a length away. Scanlon, rider of the favorite, who
finished fourth, was suspended for three months for
careless riding. Who’s Mistake, who has been racing
in the country, is a six-year-old gelding by Chipilly
—Wild Damson; he is owned by P. G. Hay and
trained by F. H. Lewis. He carried 6st. 131 b. and
HER WINNING DAY.
HUBBY: “Have any luck at the races yesterday ?”
WIFEY: “Rather! My frock gets a splendid mention in this
morning's paper."
covered the mile in lmin. 41 jsee. Batteryman
seemed to get into all sorts of trouble, and may
take a decent race within the next week or two.
That smart gelding Threeasta (9 to 2) just landed
the money in the Aspendale Plate, six furlongs, from
Solus (8) ; Lady Thrill, favorite at evens, was a
length and a half away. Threeasta has been worth
following lately.

Not being cumbered with bookmakers who
are neither use nor ornament, the South Aus. clubs
give splendid prizes; Tattersall’s Cup was worth
£2OOO this year. It was won by the St. Spasa—
Antillean mare Our Saint, owned by R. A. Miles and
ridden by Cameron ; she cleared away from the field
in the straight and won, pulling up, in 3min. 27sec.
for the two miles. Our Saint’s dividend in the £1
machine was £2 13s. ; Paroodus, who ran second
(Socratea was third), paid £5. Old St. Speed put
another race to the credit of R. E. H. Hope in the
£4OO S. J. Jacobs Handicap and returned a £9 6s.
dividend; Mentellini. the second horse, paid £ 4 ss.
Hasen : I had just collected a small
double from one of the “this-and-the-next” tribe
when I met Hyde. He began to upbraid me for
having anything to do with such poor-priced affairs.
“But, dammit, man,” I expostulated, “1 got 25 to 1.
One started at twos and the other at fours; so an
all-up bet would have netted me only 14 to 1.”
“Twenty-five to one!” said Hyde disgustedly, but
with the air of one w-ho forces himself to deal
gently with stupidity. “The double I took on the
Doncaster and Cup was at 200 to 1. Why, I got
350 to 1 about a couple in the last Caulfield and
Melbourne, and”— “Did they win?” I asked
eagerly. “Good Lord, no!” said Hyde. “I don’t
expect ’em to win. But they’re such good prices.”
* * * *
“Ricardo”: Australian racing is taking on
a revolutionary tinge with the emergence of horses
bearing such names as Robespierre, Danton, Crom-
well and Bonaparte. This opens a wide field of
sonorous nomenclature in pleasing contrast to the
“kings” and “queens” and “lords” and “ladies” of
unimaginative owners. He would be a bold man
who would name his horse Lenin, but Trotsky would
be just the thing for a utility ’orse.
* * * *
“Ascot”: Southern jockeys are apt to get
a rough spin on Brisbane courses. When Toohey
came up for the Brisbane Cup meeting last June
he was so shepherded that he could not win a race.
Young Ruane did very well at first, when he escaped
notice as an unknown apprentice, but as soon as he
had become successful he found races very hard
to won. Dick Orrell, of Newcastle (N.S.W.), is also
finding the going heavy. He was disqualified for
12 months at Albion, but the Q.T.C. committee
lifted the ban. On his return to the saddle Orrell
complained that he had been “dealt with” by an-
other rider during the running of a race at Albion.
At Ascot on Easter Saturday, when he was riding a
close finish, the whip was knocked out of his hand.
When the inquiry flag went up everyone jumped to
the conclusion that more trouble was in store for
Orrell, but this time the stewards turned their
wrath on the rider of the second horse, whom they
fined £2O for not riding his mount out.
* * * *
Ostrich-racing has been tried at a night
trotting meeting in Adelaide. Some of the birds
were ridden, and some pulled a light sulky; but in
every case they seemed quite unable to "grasp the
idea of competition. They showed great speed, but
were strangely liable to fall down, apart from
collisions, which were frequent. The spectators
found the whole thing intensely funny, and the
idea is to be developed, although some pressmen
think it should be stopped as needless cruelty.
* * * *
“Wink”: At least one Australian XI in
England wore distinguishing sashes of different
colors when on the field (B. 18/3/’26). That was
the team of abos.
which visited England
in 1868 under the
captaincy of Charlie
Lawrence. It played
47 matches, and its
all - rounder, Johnny
Mullagh, made 1698
runs, averaging 23.8,
and took 245 wickets,
averaging 10. A com-
parison with the
figures of the first
white team (Greg-
ory’s) to visit Eng-
land proves the abo.
a real champion. C.
Bannerman, who
topped the batting list,
made 723 runs, aver-
aging 24, no one else
averaging 20; and
Boyle, the most suc-
:essful bowler, took 68
wickets, averaging 9.6.
According to a publi-
cation of 1878, Greg-
ory’s men “ looked
uncommonly well en-
tering the enclosure
in t h ei r colorc-d
scarves and caps.”

“Past Grammar”:
The strong team of
Sydney cricketers
which has been touring
North Queensland
found the standard of
play there much
higher than it ex-
pected. Townsville in
particular administer-
ing a sound hiding to
Kippax’s men. Cricket
in the North has
always been of good
quality, taking into
account the difference
caused by concrete
wickets. In the days
when the Towers was
on gold, the annual
battles between the
goldfield and Towns-
ville, with an occa-
sional “ triangular ”
when Cairns joined in,
were something to
talk about. There was
a lot of betting, “Stepper” Davis and other leading
basemen of the period regularly attending for the
benefit of punters. Sweeps were also a feature.'
Proceedings sometimes closed with a single-wicket
match, “Stepper” and one of his rivals usually
matching the sides and backing their nominations.
The White Australia policy was shelved
again at the Sydney Stadium when Fernandez (Bst.
61b.) and Deleon (9st.), the Filipinos, met for the
third time. The lighter man is much the better
boxer, and he scored so heavily with both hands,
the left in particular, that it looked as if Deleon
would not last 10 rounds. Then, in response to con-
tinual urgings from his corner, Deleon began to rush
and wrestle. He held with alternate hands (to foil
the referee) and pulle'd and pushed and hauled, but
Fernandez did the only real hitting, and the other
was a weary and bashed Manilaman at half-time. He
stood it to the bitter end, but was utterly used-up
when Wallis pointed to Fernandez. Yet quite a lot
of honest toilers on the terraces left averring loudly
that “De Lion won from ’ere to Parramatta!”
The Wonthaggi miner-boxer, Gordon
Kiely (lOst. 41b.), met his Waterloo at Melbourne
Stadium when he encountered Jack Cameron (lOst.
For a start, he staggered Cameron with his
flashing left, but Jack was all over the miner in the
second, and punished him severely. In the fifth,
after being stung with lefts, Cameron dropped his
man for nine with a right body-punch. On regain-
ing his feet Kiely fought back like a wild cat, but
it was a dying effort, and as he fell back exhausted
Cameron had no trouble in administering the finishing
Old Hand” : Every now and then some
bydney bookmaker or bookmaker’s clerk goes to
Aew York, meets Griffo, and suggests a subscription
to bring that one-time ring marvel back to his
" at^ e These efforts to uproot the Rocks
leader from American soil after upwards of 30
years are entirely misplaced. The old fellow is at
home in New \ork, and can at least get enough to
five upon. Here he would find himself a stranger
and become a charge upon the State. Also, he
doesn t want to come back ; which is, or should be,
a clincher. The case of Paddy Slavin is different,
blavin was a real worker, and not a street gamin
He s . et an example to a number of
Australian heavyweights not half his age by enlisting
in the Canadian forces and fighting in France, where
he lost his only son in the trenches. A Klondyke
pioneer, he has lived in Canada for many years,
but he is no longer able to endure the severe Canadian
winters, and he wants to come back to Australia with
fi*® wife and daughters. The old people have a
military pension, and the young women are able to
support themselves. The Commonwealth Government
has granted assisted passages in manv less deserving
cases.
* * * *
Shrewsbury”: Among the hideous welter
of rival cricket prophets now infesting the British
press, it is a relief to come on someone with a
fresh bit of information to impart. This is Lionel
Tennyson, England’s captain of 1921. Tennyson
has just returned from a cricket tour of the West
Indies, and his information about the cricketers of
the old slave colonies is as refreshing to the news-
paper-reader, weary of interminable musings on Test
prospects, as the sight of the islands themselves
was to the fed-up seamen of Columbus. West Indian
cricket has improved out of sight, says Lionel, since
the first side from there visited England over 30
years ago. It is equal to South African form, and
capable of giving the Big Pair a good fight. Many
of the first-flighters are colored men, the darker
section of the population showing great aptitude
for the game. It has always been a puzzle to the
writer why Maoriland form is not up to S’African
at least, though the will to do better is becoming
' l Pl >n *v n t latterly. The attributes which have made
the Maonlander such a supreme player of Rugby
are all assets for cricket. Only an Evangelist is
wanting.
* * * •
“Really”: Before they draw the stumps
Gil next summer, let justice be done to George
Kennedy, of Ballarat, who in his last five innings
has scored 480 runs, including four centuries, without
being once out. Also, his leg-breaks have bagged
100 wickets this year. George has played in first-
class cricket (at least Ballarat reckons it first-class)
for more than half his life. He is in the sixties.
* * * *
Clem Hill goes to England this week, at
a big retaining fee, to write about the Test matches
on the scenes where he himself made a name just
30 years ago. S. A. Jockey Club and the
allied bodies have given him the necessary leave of
absence from his duties as a‘ stipendiary steward, and
Adelaide sportsmen got together to give him a big
send-off—and a case of pipes.
* * * *
“G. 0.8.”: Yie. football clubs are slow to
learn the foolishness of giving inter-State leather-
chasers a summer residence and a trifle for pocket-
money on the off-chance that they will play for them.
Last year Carlton spent £9O trying to make a South
Aus. man feel at home —and then lost him. Gee-
long has been boasting that the Westralian star
Snowy” Hamilton was a resident, and would make
its premier team still more formidable. But it is
Subiaco (W.A.) which can do the skiting, for “Snow”
is flitting to a better offer over there, and Geelong
is gloomily writing off £5O.
* * * *
“Centurion”: The N.S.W. Rugby Union,
which has had a hard climb since it started again,
after closing down for the war years, can fairly
claim to have breasted the hill. It has been fortu-
nate in. having a splendid reserve and
ground in the Great Public Schools, though a big
proportion of the general public has gone solidly
for the amateur game. Better even than ; the metro-
politan results is the news of progress in outside
districts. Newcastle has soundly re-established the
game, while the North-Western and New England
centres, which have kept the flag flying, have gone
forward. Bathurst and Orange, once strongholds of
the game, are re-establishing it, and the revival of
Country Week may bring a return of the days when
the country unions furnished a big proportion of the
N.S.W. representative sides. With the Maori and
All Black visits this season, and the English tour
in prospect, all the material offering is likely to
be needed.
* * * *
“Avon” : Not since the All Blacks wiped
the floor with the English Rugby XV has Maoriland
been so worked up over a sporting event as it has
over the sending of Randolph Rose to compete in
the British running championships. The question
of providing a companion, “not a manager or a
trainer,” for Rose was debated for weeks, and finally
the choice fell on the runner’s close personal friend
J. W. McHolm, holder of the Australasian hammer-
throwing record. McHolm is a police-sergeant, but
leave of absence was granted before it was even
asked. The only fly in the ointment has been the
very slow response to the appeal for public subscrip-
tions. But the average Maorilander has to get
terribly excited before lie parts with any of his
bawbees.

Municipal golf on the North Adelaide
parklands has been such a success that money is
to be spent in encouraging it. There are now 263
subscribers, besides those who come in for a casual
round, and the profit on the last year’s working
was nearly £3OO. The City Corporation has agreed
to spend anything up to £3OOO in large extensions
to the present golf-house.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“England should develop special barracking for
the Tests more humorous than the Australians’
hackneyed ‘Get a bag!’ and ‘Take a cab!’”
—London Evening News.
To barrack in a hidebound way
Denotes a wit inferior.
’Tis England’s task to now essay
Something a trifle cheerier.
We’ll shun the skite the casual wight
Is prone to voice, from dawn till night,
And put these lvangaroosters wise
Where England’s prowess really lies.
Some humorous remarks about
Their aptitude for borrowing
Might get a well-set batsman out
And send him pav.-wards sorrowing.
Or, p’r’aps, a neat, but quite discreet,
Allusion to that famous fleet
That spread its canvas in the breeze
To take their fathers overseas.
Pert Cockney personalities
Could discompose our visitors.
Howled, in a coarse, facetious guise,
By leather-lunged inquisitors:
Gibes bravely' decked with dialect—
Yorkshire for choice —-might have effect.
Some folk are ne’er so sorely stung
As in an unfamiliar tongue.
So Britons, rally to the call,
And face the issue sturdily !
To cramp their skill with bat and ball
We’ll obfuscate them wordily.
Until, in glee, at last we see
The foemen routed hopelessly—
And up-to-date linguistic guile
Regain the laurels for our Isle.

Look into the
Battery Question!
If you were going to make a new battery,
what would be your aim ?
You’d want to make a battery that possessed
all the good features of every other battery
on the market but without their faults.
And that is just how the Westinghouse Battery
was produced. Because specially - processed ele-
ments gave longer life, these ( elements were
included. Because warped and leaky cases
caused premature breakdown of other batteries,
Westinghouse perfected the one-piece, moulded
composition case. Because individual jars moved
around and impaired the efficiency of other bat-
teries, Westinghouse Battery cases are made with
extra-strong composition divisions that do away
with individual jars.
Make sure your next Battery is a Westinghouse—the very name
is a guarantee that it will not fail you

THE INKY WAY.
From the Marlborough (M.L.) Express
(22/3/’26) :■ —
Last night the Rev. Father delivered a
vigorous discourse on “The Value of an Immoral
Love,” to a crowded congregation.
It is little things like this that peptonise an
editor’s breakfast.
Just-dead William Robertson, who owned
up to a Glasgow University training, was
once private secretary to Mcllwraith, a long-
ago Premier in Queensland. Then he drifted
into journalism. He was on the Barrier
Miner, and later became editor of Broken
Hill -Daily Truth. Latterly he was with
the Labor Herald in Adelaide while it
lived, and till his sight failed did good work
there in various municipal and public causes.
“Semaj” : Left last month for a holiday in
Britain and on the Continent, F. T. Robert-
son, Langdon Bonython’s associate as editor
of the Adelaide Advertiser. The literary
staff farewelled him with a travelling-rug and
a brimming measure of goodwill. Over half
a century on the same paper—it is 54 years in
this case —must be something near a record.
The voyager, who is accompanied by his wife
and daughter, will disembark from the
Ostcrley at Naples. A visit may later be
paid to Norway.
As the result of the recent annual con-
ference at Adelaide the Australian Journal-
ists’ Association has been . consolidated and
strengthened. The difference between the
majority of the other districts and N.S.W.
on the number of votes exercisable at con-
ference was adjusted, the headquarters were
retained at Melbourne, and the system of
rewarding meritorious service was restored,
with safeguards. Ivenderdine’s services for
three years as general president were
specially recognised.
“Milly Soak” : In a fairly long experience
of police-court reporting, I treasure the
memory of one drunk who got home on the
sergeant in a single word. The prosecutor,
a pompous but not markedly literate official,
opened the dialogue with “Was you drunk?”
The question might have seemed superfluous,
but a gleam of humor came into the least
injured of the delinquent’s pair of discolored
eyes. “I were,” he admitted frankly, and I
am perfectly certain the magistrate took the
repartee into consideration when he barked
“Cautioned” instead of the usual “Fined five
shillings.”
Pressmen at Sydney Show this year found
a new steward looking after them in the
place of the late Dick Pegg. Colonel C. H
Granville —“Granny” to every officer or man
who passed through the Ist Light Horse,
though it was never safe to accost him as
Horace was born in Wales, but wisely
came to Australia young. He first went
to the wars as a trooper in the Australian
Horse, accompanied Roberts to Pretoria, and
in the Great Scrimmage was twice in tem-
porary command of the Ist L. H. Brigade.
Nowadays he is back on the land at West
Maitland.
“Fitzcray” : Syd Deamer, who takes R. W.
Kenderdine’s place as president of the
A.J.A., is a mild and pince-nezed individual
whose slight physique and general air of
being of the intelligentsia suggest that he
never handled anything heavier than a blue
pencil. Nevertheless, as a youthful pommy
in Westralia he tackled such jobs as navvy-
ing and sleeper-cutting. The war saw him
with a commission in the Australian Flying
Corps, where he learned the game under the
late Oswald Watt. After that show was
over he started the School Sportsman in
Sydney, a weekly intended to cater for the
games side of the G.P.S. aud primary
schools. It was an excellent little publica-
tion, but the then high cost of newsprint
stifled the promising infant. After a spell
on the Sydney Sun he transferred to the
Melbourne office, and thence to the Herald
group as chief sub.
“Arawa”: “The name of Samuel Bennett
will long be remembered as the founder of
the first evening newspaper li.e., Evening
News] in Sydney.” Thus Governor de
Chair at the official opening of the new
Evening News office; and editor Knox said
something to the same effect. But the
News was not Sydney’s l first evening paper.
Away back in ’59 the Evening Mail blos-
somed for about three months and then with-
ered. That was eight years before the News
made its debut. Sam Bennett came to
N.S.W. in 1841 under engagement to
Stephens and Stokes, then proprietors of the
Sydney Herald (now the S. M. Herald),
and when in the same year Ivemp and Fair-
fax bought the paper Sam became the head
of the printing department and held the job
for 17 years. In ’59 he acquired the Empire,
Parkes’s old paper, which first appeared at
the end of 1850 and struggled along pain-
fully until '5B, when it went under. In the
following year its publication was resumed
under Bennett’s guiding hand, and it was
then that the Mail turned up its toes.
“Avon”: Just retired from the job of Chief
Parliamentary librarian at Wellington (M.L.),
Charlie Wilson, who started his 50-year
sojourn in the Shivery Isles as a school-
master and then drifted into journalism.
After subbing the Wanganui Chronicle he
wielded the thunder of various provincial
journals, winding up in charge of the now
long-defunct N.Z. Mail in Wellington. One
term in Parliament as a Liberal member
paved the way to a recognition of his talents
as a librarian, and for 25 years he has been
almost as well-known a Parliamentary insti-
tution as Bellamy’s. His hobby has been
the study of modern fiction and the collection
of relies of Dickens and R. L. Stevenson,
and for many years he has contributed a
weekly article on novels, old and new, to the
Wellington Dominion and Christchurch
Lyttelton Times. His bandwriting is
awful, and some years ago, in response to
the tearful appeals of suib-editors, he bought
a typewriter. But the darned thing has no
double-quotation marks, and as Wilson
quotes ciuite half of whdlt he writes, and as
he is almost as bad a typist as a penman,
the change has brought no real relief.

No bacchanal can last for ever, and the
Pavlova spree is at an end for Melbourne.
The Russian lady’s final orgy was the long
Quixote ballet. The story of the foolish
knight was set to rhythms by Pavlova, made
melodious by Minkus and decorated by the
vivid art of Korovine and Allegri, who surely
dipped their brushes in the sunshine of
'southern Spain to get that recreation of
Barcelona in the initial act. If Cervantes,
who died in poverty in Madrid, was looking
on, he must have been pleased to see his
unregarded manuscript thus ornately treated ;
and the spectacle of thousands of members
of a nation he had never heard of paying
a guinea a head to view the opulent pro-
duction may even have consoled him for get-
ting no royalties from the performance.
Rosinante was reincarnated in an Australian
moke. It is a tribute to the S.P.C.A. that
no equine could be found sufficiently starved
to fill the part without the addition of a
make-up—its ribs were realistically painted.
Sancho Panza arrived on his donkey and
was duly tossed in a blanket, to a slow
orchestral movement. Dulcinea danced as a
dream-vision of the knight in the person of
Pavlova. There were both humor and senti-
ment in the production; but the author
would have missed his satire. Pavlova was
also an innkeeper’s daughter. In a final
review of the lady’s exquisite art, only bird
similes float into this critic’s mind. A dis-
embodied spirit, something fey, a marvel-
lous machine —she is these things also —but
never a human lover; and one feels sorry for
the indefatigable Novikoff, condemned, like
the young man of Keats’s Grecian urn, for
ever to pursue but never to attain to what
is a wraith of femininity rather than some-
thing of flesh and blood.

One of the imperishable memories of a

tor is concerned, is of the ladies Stuart.
Nichols, Crofton, Elkington, Mathers and
Dolomore —nearly all English names, you

Brahms, at which one was never sure whether
one was listening to music or looking at it.

Clara Butt has passed through three stages
in her singing life. The first was an artistic
phase which gave thousands unalloyed de-
light. The second was sternly patriotic, when
she devoted herself to martial ditties. The
last w r as displayed at her two farewell con-
certs at Melbourne Exhibition last week.
It may be described as ecclesiastical. A
truly transcendental chorister was Clara
standing sheathed in silver like an archangel
with her head already in the stars, or, at
least, on a level with Alberto Zelman’s, de-
spite the tall box that diminutive director
was perched on. Besides her Sabbatical
hymnal, the Dame embroidered Elgar’s set-
ting of A. L. Gordon’s “The Swimmer” with
her rich gong notes; for the last time Ken-
nerley Rumford helped his partner to find
the keys of Heaven, the audience displaying
no loss of interest in the pious hunt; and
Marie Ausseuac, pianiste, attacked Chopin
with tremendous vigor and occasional access
of passion. The Symphony Orchestra dealt
with the “Merry Wives of Windsor” (Nico-
lai) according to their deserts, although an
old reluctance to take their cue was some-
times manifest amongst the violins. A singer
new to Melbourne, Ethel Osborn, of Queens-
land, attacked an excerpt from “Lucia” with
a sweet and expressive soprano voice; but
many of the higher notes were her masters.

Whatever the defects of “Mercenary

proof of the prevalence of the vice in Mel-

reason for supplying the audience with a
glossary of terms.

Melbourne Majesty’s, at the moment in
mourning for Pavlova, will forget its sorrow
in “The Gondoliers” on Saturday. There
are hints abroad that this season of G. and
S. opera is going to be the very finest Aus-
tralia has seen. The Bulletin wishes the
Firm success. It will wish success for any-

Dollie and Billie, two musical comediennes
who have held the hearts of kings in their
hands, were received by Melbourne Tivoli
frequenters with marks of more than royal
favor on Monday. Ben Nee One, the Celes-
tial humorist, once again made his Oriental
bow; Raymond Ellis aired an operatic bari-
tone; and Gardiner and Durham spent the
evening in the air, with slight assistance from
a horizontal-bar. Fantasi is knotting his
legs behind his neck—has anybody ever
paused to consider what the world would be
like to live in if nobody could knot his legs
behind his neck?

The entrepreneur of ancient Rome used
to keep up his supply of pygmies by bind-
ing ordinary babies in bandages, but this
paper brings no such charge against Sir
Benj. Fuller with regard to the 25 midgets
ar present showing at Melbourne Bijou. They
appear, on their own scale, to be perfectly
formed; and their intelligence is quite equal
to that of Philetus, of Cos, who, to keep
himself from being blown away, had to carry
weights in his pockets, but was nevertheless
a great poet and tutor to Ptolemy Phila-
delphus. Patrons of this playhouse are
dividing their applause about equally be-
tween the small people and the full-size per-
formers. Grace and Keats do not very ex-
traordinary things with a piano; the Romano
Bros, are gladiatorial exponents, whose
turn, however, is quite innocent of blood;
and Murfayne gives an endurance display on
the xylophone which is innocent of music.

Warner Baxter is the red-blooded he-man
—without whom no Wild West landscape is
complete—in a few thousand feet of love
and fighting at Hoyt’s Melbourne emporium
this week. “The Son of His Father” is the
thriller’s title. At the Majestic Constance
Bennett is fully engaged in tying a man and
his male progeny in the toils of a guilty pas-
sion, while Irene Rich is standing by to
cut the knot. “My Wife and I” is the name
of the domestic maze; and an A)sop’s fable
is told with a snap and sparkle that would
surprise the leisurely old Greek fabulist if
he could step down from the Elysian fields
to see it.

The Bankers’ Operatic Society (Sydney)
deserves a few cheers for getting away from
the traditions of amateur organisations of
this class; instead of selecting an old-estab-
lished imported medium to display its mem-
bers’ abilities, it made “The Radio Girl,”
“MERCEMARY MARY.” AT MEL-
BOURNE PRINCESS.
Mary (Mai Bacon ) and her in-financial hus-
band (Jack Morrison).
written and composed by a local man, Rex
Shaw, the offering presented at the Sydney
Conservatorium on Saturday night. But the
author himself is too much obsessed by im-
ported material of the light order. “The
Radio Girl” is certainly not a musical
comedy as it is described; nevertheless it has
some points as a revue, and the stage set-
tings were unusually ambitious —especially
a view of Sydney Harbor in 1931, bridge and
all. The performers, some of them showing
too evidently a stiff response to careful train-
ing, did very creditably with the dialogue,
fondling some rare old chestnuts as if they
were new-born jokes.
** * *
The Players’ Club introduced Pirandello to
Sydney audiences at St. James’s Hall last week
and performed the ceremony with a compre-
hensive if somewhat angular gesture. But,
then, it would take an Irving and an Ellen
Terry to handle some of the scenes, so
subtle is “Right You Are (If You Think
So),” so cunningly does the author juggle
with the thread between the things that are
and those that are not. The story concerns
one Ponza, a junior clerk in a consulate,
his wife and his mother-in-law, Mrs, Frola.
The Ponzas have just settled in the town,
Ponza and his wife in a shabby flat and the
mother-in-law in one of the town’s best
apartments. But the daughter and the
mother are never allowed to meet, and
neither goes abroad. The gossips immedi-
arely hint and buzz. Ponza explains the
situation by saying that his mother-in-law
is insane, that his first wife (her daughter)
is dead, but that her delusion is that his
second wife is her daughter alive once more,
and that to save her from the agony of dis-
covering the mistake he never allows the two
to meet. For her part, Mrs. Frola tells just
as credible a story—it is Ponza who has
delusions; she declares that his wife
and her daughter are one. The desperate
gossips call for an explanation from Ponza’s
wife, and get it in these words: “I am the
daughter of Mrs. Frola, and the second wife
of Mr. Ponza; as for myself, I am nobody.”
What is truth, indeed? The actors were not
line-perfect on the opening night, but there
was some fine work in the interpretations.
For instance, Vera Keogh’s Mrs. Frola was
an excellent simulation of distraught old
age; but a little more indication that she was
talking to the people on the stage would
have been an improvement. James Hatton’s
Ponza was a mixture of the admirable and
the inept; Clive Coppard as Laudisi showed
good form, but was not subtle enough. Yet,
all in all, it was a good show.

The desire to see an old popular favorite
in her best rOle, as well as to help the very
good cause she is sponsoring, should gather
a great crowd to the Grand Opera House
(Sydney) for the Radium matinee, which
takes place next Thursday afternoon, 22nd
inst. “Sweet Nell of Old Drury” will pro-
vide the entertainment.
Sydney Tivoli has been blessed with Niobe,
the under-the-water girl, for only four days;
after to-night (Thursday) she rushes away
to Maoriland to fulfil engagements, but will
return. Hers is a baffling act. The weighty
June Mills, who throws herself about amaz-
ingly for a girl of her tonnage, is making her
first appearance on the Tivoli circuit with
her sepulchral-voiced partner, Mclnnis. Bob
Albright, who grows monotonous, has re-
turned ; and Gautier’s dogs still provide plen-
tiful amusement. Some excitement is being
thrown into the programme by a quartette
of champion wood-choppers, the Weston
Brothers, Leo Appo and Manny McMahon,
whose muscular development is a turn in
itself. It is to be hoped the sturdy axemen
don’t lose their blocks—it is what usually
happens to the athlete transplanted to the
stage.
** * *
The Veterans of Variety and Jim Gerald
divide Fullers’ Sydney programme, and, see-
ing the popularity of the comedian, it is
saying a lot to mention that the Veterans
are by no means the least popular part of
the show. They have changed their num-
bers ; and when they conclude their act with
“Say Au Revoir but not Good-bye” the audi-
ence feels that it wants to hear more of the
old-time melodies. Jim Gerald is hilarious
in “Whips and Quips,” but that light offer-
ing might be drained of at least one bar-
room “joke,” reminiscent of the most insani-
tary days of Stilly and Mo. It isn’t good
to find Gerald yielding to the tendency to
deliver such stuff.
** * &
The Wanda Sisters have been added to the
spangled wonders of Wirths’ Circus in Syd-
ney, and their contortion act is a good one.
“Les Musicales” is another new act, more
merry than musical; and the Flying Nelsons
still round off the programme with a climax
of thrill. It is a matter of taste, however,
wliat is most preferred in the medley pro-
vided ; as the old showman said, when he was
asked which was the Terrible Man-eating
Tiger and which the Great Wild African
Baboon. “You pays your money, and you
takes your choice.”
❖ ❖ ❖
In “Toss of the D’Urbervilles,” at Sydney
Lyceum, all the literature of Hardy’s book
is left out, and a plot of plain melodrama
remains. But the melodrama is given a very
fine background of English scenery, every
picture an artistic triumph ; and that to some
extent redeems the film. Hoyt’s gives chief
place to “The Palace of Pleasure,” a Cinder-
ella story, in which the bold, bad bandit who
abducts the innocent Betty Compson learns
to be virtuous and married. “The Trouble
with Wives,” which supports, states dis-
tressing facts, warmed up for the public
palate, rather than solutions —at all events,
solutions that seem real. “The New Com-
mandment,” a picture showing Ben Lyon
and Blanche Sweet in a war-time story, is
an artistic production, and has plenty of
excitement, too. It is shown at the Strand.
** * *
“The Gondoliers” at the Royal and “Uncle
Tom” at the Prince of Wales were Adelaide’s
main dramatic fare for Easter holidays and
after. Gilbert and Sullivan are always a
safe card to play, appealing almost as much
to the new generation, which finds them a
novelty, as to the middle-aged, to whom they
are old friends. The cast is strong, with
Charles Walenn a shade in front; also the
staging is more effective than in some former
revivals. Business is big. In pictures the
York shows American wealth indulging in
foolishness at Palm Beach and elsewhere.
Wondergraph has that fine actor Lewis
Stone in a Hichens story of Englishmen in
the desert behind Algiers; also Charles Chap-
lin is having a third innings in “The Gold
Rush” —at the Pav. this time. But the most
thrilling thing at the moment is at West’s:
Valentino as an “eagle,” fighting and making
love in Russia and thereabouts.
*❖ * *
Two Adelaide shows :
The veteran James Ashton has in his studio the
results of a recent holiday in Victoria. He studied
Lome and Healesville by day and by night, and had
the luck to strike the bush-fires. The change of
scene and atmosphere gives his work a freshness
that is remarkable at his age. Formerly one could
always swear to a James Ashton from the other side
of a large room, but this is not the case now. His
art, always sound, is the more refreshing for this
new versatility.
Monte Luke has brought from Sydney a collection
of his camera-pictures, including some that have
gained high honor in three other continents. South
Australian artist-photographers concentrate mostly on
landscape, but Luke scores heavily also in figure
studies.
“L.H.P.”: Walter Sanford’s production of
“Uncle Tom’s Cabin” (B. 18/3/’26) intro-
duced real American negroes, headed by
Charlie Pope, in plantation hymns, songs
and dances. Sanford was Uncle Tom, and
another American mummer, George Kunkel,
played Legree. Louise Carbasse, now Louise
Lovely, was Little Eva, and Pope played
Chloe. There was also an “Uncle Tom”
production at the Sydney Adelphi in 1913
or 1914 under Geo. Willoughby.

“Curtain-Raiser”: In spite of the fact
that previous efforts to pin her butterfly
movements to the silver sheet had disap-
pointed her, Pavlova obliged the moyie-men
by dancing a stave before them in the garden
of George Tallis’s house in Melbourne. The
effect waq queer, for the only music that
accompanied her enchanting motions was in
her head and the crankings of the machines.
After dancing one selection she changed her
raiment and was starting on another when
suddenly her mood altered. She stopped
and poured out a stream of Russian, every
word of which sounded like an expletive.
The canvas, it appeared, had become too
slippery for her to think of going on. Those
supple ankles are worth too much to take
chances with.
“Flaming Youth” : Minnie Everett has her
name upon the programme of the Gilbert
and Sullivan revivals, which have made a
start in Adelaide, as producer. It is the
first time a woman has appeared in that
capacity in professional productions in Aus-
tralia. Miss Everett was brought up in
the dancing business; the Misses Everett’s
dancing school at Bondi Junction was notable
nearly 25 years ago. Later, theatrical
managements in search of capable ballet-
mistresses snapped her up.
“Hamfat”: Nellie Stewart, who will be
seen again as Sweet Nell at the Sydney Opera
House matinee on April 22 —it is in aid of
her Radium Fund—will have a jubilee next
year. It was in 1877 that she made her first
stage appearance in a shown known as
“Rainbow Revels,” which to-day might be
called revue. The co., organised by her
father Richard Stewart, toured Australasia
twice, and went to India, Britain and
America. After that Nellie was brought
back, with other members, to play the name-
part in George Coppin’s pantomime “Sin-
bad,” in 1880.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Florence Austral, on
her second visit to America, has registered
a very emphatic success, the beauty of her
rich voice and the convincing quality of her
art going right home. Phyllis Archibald,
who made many friends in Australia, has
also done well , this season in America, and
is. sure of solid booking for next winter.
Kitty Reidy made her London debut in
“Wildflower” at the Shaftesbury. She acted
with vivacity, and, despite nervousness, gave
a good account of her bright voice. Howett
Worster, who was also in the cast, was suc-
cessful, too. Another Sydney favorite, Mark
Daly, had a chance in this production, and
when he gets a really good part looks like
becoming a London favorite.
“F.S.” (Loud.) : Mr. and Mrs. E. J.
Carroll have arrived from Australia via
America, where “E. J.” has been looking in on
things. He arrived at the Savoy just in
time to give his blessing to the Don Cossack
Choir, which set off for Australia at the week-
end, and he is now busy fixing up a London
office. He has schemes for showing his two
latest pictures in Europe, and is sure that
“The Moth of Moonbi” and “Jewelled
Nights” will have as big a success as “The
Sentimental Bloke.” Anyhow, he has
arrived at the psychological moment. There
is a great British-film boom on ,at the
moment. Amongst the attractions secured
by “E.J.” for Australia are “The Best
People” and “Outward Bound,” two plays
which have drawn enthusiastic audiences
here. Unless something unexpected happens
he will soon again lead Kreisler through
Australia; and Stefansson, St-ephen Leacock
and Rebecca West are among his booked
lecture tours.
“Voice Off”: Ward Lyons, who battled
hard for his crust on the Australian stage
for donkey’s years before he made a hit as
the peppery old hard-doer in Cappy Ricks,”
has done very well in Maoriland with the
Yankee play. Lyons goes to London under
the guidance of Philip Lytton on April 21.
He opens at the Royalty Theatre there as
Cappy Ricks on June 19.
“Short Circuit”: Bland Holt and his wife
spend half the year at Sorrento and the other
half at Ivew. At Sorrento they share the
beautiful home of Miss Coppin, daughter of
the famous George. Bland is as young as
ever and as upright as a sapling. He still has
his dogcart and tandem, but has compromised
with modernity by learning to drive a motor-
car and having wireless installed. Harrie
Ireland, the vamp of the Holt dramas, is
a constant visitor at “The Anchorage,” Sor-
rento, but nearly all the others who fretted
their hour with the comedian and his wife
have made their final exit. Arthur Styan
was the last to go.
“Hamfat” : How well Sydney theatres are
booked up for first nights, whatever happens,
has been learnt by a playgoer who thought
he would like to
join the happy
throng. He is
friendly with
house - managers,
but the best one
could do for him
was stalls in L row ;
another indicated
seats two rows
further forward,
but at the extreme
end; and an out-
side allotment in
the third row of the
d.c. was the offer-
ing of a third.
First-nighters are
now so strongly
entrenched that
they even nominate
their successors in
case of death or
absence abroad.
But disputes arise
sometimes; then
the management
has to arbitrate.
There are always
people, of course,
who notify the
management that
they do not require
their seats. When
such notifications
come in by the
sheaf it is a clear
sign that the play
will be a failure—
public taste seems
to average out in a
quite remarkable
fashion. Arthur
Wigram Allen is
Sydney’s most per-
sistent first-nighter; he has been at it
for three decades. But he gets some of
the money back —he is a big shareholder in
the Williamson firm.
“Clarenza”: Another of Dan Barry’s
trump cards. (B. 25/3/’26) was “Home Rule
for Ireland,” written, so he announced, by
a member of the Parnell family. Which
prompted a jovial N.S.W. North Coast priest
who had seen the piece to observe: “So Dan
is related to the Parnells, is he!”
“Goldilocks”: It is a very ample Nellie
Ferguson who, as his quadroon slave-girl,
punches melodramatic lines at Degree in the
Nellie. Bramley version of “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin.” Old-stagers find it hard to identify
her with the Nellie Ogden who, as a delicate-
looking child, starred as Joe in “Lady Dead-
lock’s Secret” (the stage story of Dickens’s
“Bleak House”), or, grown-up, but still
slender, gave a serpentine touch to adven-
turess parts. As an infant prodigy, Nellie
had a self-possession remarkable in a cbild-
actress, and she could always look pathetic.
Daughter of D’Orsay Ogden and Helen Fer-
gus, she adapted her mother’s maiden name
upon joining the Williamson firm many years
ago.
“Caul-boy”: An item ...of old Australian
theatrical history that caught my eye the
other day read gratefully. “The Garrick
Club,” it said, “played ‘Cinderella’ at the
Victoria Theatre, Sydney, last night (April
9, 1876), when the house was full to suffo-
cation, but the performance was hissed
loudly.” What depths of bathos, bum-acting
and sob-stuffery must be plumbed before the
flapper audiences of to-day will refuse their
meed of polite applause, let alone hiss or
heave the decomposing feline.
“Wood’s Green” (Baris) : Baul Demasy
has written a new tragedy, “Delilah,” which
has been produced at the Odeon, and has
engaged the warm interest of the city’s best-
known lovers of serious drama. At many
points the story recalled Milton’s treatment
of the theme; at others it followed closely
the Biblical narration. The final scene
touches new ground; out of the ruins of
Gaza Samson emerges, hqving burst his
chains and escaped from prison. This sym-
bol of the triumphant soul was not accept-
able even to all those connoisseurs who
accepted Demasy’s new work as a master-
piece. One detail of the first-night production,
the shearing of Samson’s locks, almost led to
an anti-climax. Delilah was not a deft
artist with the scissors, and when Samson
revealed his bobbed hair the likeness be-
tween his condition and that of the flapper
of to-day made it difficult to repress a giggle.
“Flaming Youth”: Clara Butt says that
when she sang “The Lost Chord” for him,
Arthur Sullivan told her it was the first time
he had heard the song as it should be sung.
FULLY EQUIPPED.
“She’s getting the principal part in the new play.”
“But she hasn’t had the necessary experience, has she?”
“Oh, yes; she was leading lady in a divorce case lately, and got
columns of publicity.”
A compliment meant to be as sincere was
given by a condemned man in the old Mel-
bourne Gaol. One of the parties which regu-
larly attend to brighten the lives of prisoners
had taken a gramophone with them, Clara
Butt’s favorite ditty being one of the records.
The condemned man was deeply moved.
“After ’earin’ that,” he explained solemnly,
‘i‘t makes a man feel that there’s somethin’
in bein’ ’anged.”
“Retired Villain”: Jules Grant, of the
humorous eyes, left for England on March 16.
Jules does not look nearly old enough to have
had a theatrical history extending over four
decades, but he links up with the Coppin
days and the times when George Tallis (now
a knight) was treasurer at Sydney Royal.
Grant struck up a friendship, which ripened
into a partnership, with Bert Bailey, and
the partnership discovered a gold-mine in “On
Our Selection.” Although Grant has wan-
dered all over Australasia, this is his first
venture abroad. While he is travelling, Bert
Bailey will carry on the housekeeping at
Melbourne King’s—unless Bert receives a
call signifying that London wants to renew
its acquaintance with “On Our Selection.”
“Lond.”: Noticed a wave of sentimentality
in the ballroom lately? London Bystander
declares that there is a marked one, and
that it is entirely due to Irving Berlin having
been separated from his girl by her mil-
lionaire father; on which he mournfully
wrote “What’ll I do?” and “All alone,” and
the dancing world dropped the old brisk fox-
trot measures for the new sugary strains. The
Mackay millionaire ultimately relented, the
pair were married, and the Berlin beat has
grown livelier; but the results of Irving's
period of gloom are world-wide.
“Machete” : The alleged “composers” who
perpetrate the hiccuping cacophonies of jazz
(B. l/4/’26) rarely, if ever, attempt an
original theme. They pick up some melody
or other by ear. Passing through their jazz
mentalities the theme emerges in a strange
and distorted guise, much as an excellent
dog comes out at the other end of a sausage-
machine as dubious bologna. At least a
dozen of the beastly things are based on
Mendelssohn’s fataily attractive Spring
Song. Indeed, the too sweetly melodious
Jew has claims to be considered the grand-
father of jazz.
“Adam Ant” : “Quality Street,” which has
been revived at Melbourne King’s (it was
first produced in 1902), retains its freshness
and charm. One can’t help comparing the
present east with that of the Brough-Flem-
ming production of other years. In that
outbreak Brough was the “dashing” Valen-
tine Brown. Brian Aherne, the present
Brown, is the tallest mummer we have had
here since Arthur Garner or Sir William
Don. It is his only fault, however. The
part of Susan Throssel, excellently done by
Mary Jerrold in the present show, was one
of Beatrice Day’s successes when she and
we were young.
“Centurion” : A lot of acid has been poured
on the plays of Eugene O’Neill, but it has
been reserved for Hollywood to drop the
cockroach in the consomme, as it were. Be-
cently an entire theatrical company which
had essayed to produce O’Neill’s “Desire
Under the Elms” was arrested by order of
the Los Angeles city fathers. Los Angeles,
of which Hollywood is a part—and nowa-
days about the most important part—had
banned O’Neill’s play as “obscene.” Some-
how it recalls the ancient simile regarding
the pious airs of a painted lady (retired) at
a christening.
“Tenakope”: Add to “Glen A.’s” list of
“performers” in the N.S.W. Parliament (B.
l/4/’26) the name of Paddy Minahan,
M.L.A. Paddy was a cornetist in Fitz-
geralds’ circus band before he went into the
boot-and-shoe trade.
Norman Lindsay shows more etchings:—
The inverted wowser with the patience of a
medisval monk and the passionate abandon of a revi-
valist preacher continues to propagate his gospel in a
new series of etchings now on show at the Fine Art
Gallery, Melbourne. The gospel isn’t as well known
as it needs to be if the artist’s work is to be moi"
to the spectator than a mere repetition of unintel-
ligible motives. Lindsay has been at pains to
write a book to explain matters. The credo, briefly,
is that as the savage in man is not destroyed, bur
only made more dangerous by repression and asceti-
cism, the function of sex must be vitalised by art, and
a new definition of beauty found, or hate must reign
supreme. Freud supplied this faith with a new
jargon, but it is noteworthy that the greatest art of
the past was concerned with the same objective under
different names. Whether Lindsay will give to
Beauty, which badly needs it, a new expression is
a matter of opinion, but there are grounds for hope,
since he continues to advance every year along all
the highways of his genius, while the critics, one
and all, confine themselves to cautious approval of
his technique, as if he were a new kind of internal
combustion engine only. Lately they have plucked
up sufficient heart to declare that he cannot draw,
although they omitted to observe this until that
capable dull journeyman William Orpen made some
remarks in London. The charge of lack of drawing
against such a surperb essay in rhythm as “Beetho-
ven’s Eighth Symphony” in the present exhibition is
made by people who would have turned down “Antony
and Cleopatra” because the author couldn’t spell.
Lindsay is attempting themes no man has attempted
to handle before, and his success or failure will
utlimately be judged—as that other “bad” draughts-
man El Greco has been judged—on the broadest
lines. In the present show he turns to some new
derices. An aquatint, “Moonlight Piper,” tackles
Cynthia’s difficult beams with notable success; a
witty study of his mistresses competing for the Merry
Monarch’s favor is richly done in drypoint; “Cards
and Women” is a trite subject nobly dealt with, and
in “The Windmill” a deliciously airy picture is
made out of the sweeping lines of the mill and the
merrymaking crew beneath it. A special session of
the Federal census staff would be required to count
the figures in “Allegro Vivace,” the Beethoven in-
terpretation, with its rippling undercurrent of gay
mannikins overlaid with a ribald riot of vast earth
spirits. Lindsay’s favorite theme of a tangle of
human bodies arranged in unusual diapasons is not
greatly in evidence, however. There is one picture
which contains no legs at all, except those attached
to a brace of ducks.
CONDENSED SERMONS.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
“He had seen his wife taking her children to the
pictures. He remembered the films —‘Dangerous
Kisses’ and ‘Restless Wives.’ (Laughter.)”
—Sydney divorce case.
The themes are old as Sin is;
O Marmadukes and Minnies,
Or even Jacks and Jennies
Bound in connubial gyves,
I charge you: shun the blisses
Derived from dangerous kisses,
And dodge the precipices
That yawn for restless wives.
The mission of the movies
To all the earth to prove is
The Joan-and-Darby groove is
The proper path to tread.
They pillory the dangers
Awaiting fickle rangers
Toward lips that should be strangers
To persons duly wed.
You wives who feel a stirring
Within your breasts for erring,
An influence deterring
These headlines should convey.
The text is in the title,
It breathes a warning vital
’Gainst conduct unmarital—
Whatever’s in the play.
They blare from many a hoarding,
A moral shock recording,
A chance to learn affording
'Ere it may be too late—
The tangles husbands get in
Flirtatious ways who’re set in,
The fate of wives who fret in
The matrimonial state.
Sermons in stones are lurking
For those who go not “kirking,”
’Tis said. I find it irking
To tread those sylvan pads.
The sermon that engrosses,
The saw that ne’er verbose is,
I take—in tabloid doses—
From moving-picture ads.

Phlim: Thanks; we observed London
Punch’s recent appropriation of our own old
“Tattsmania”....See See: Interesting, but in a
matter of that kind we ought to have something
better than the story somebody unspecified told you.
....M.L.F.: Some nice phrases; but the ideas are
so worn... .Minnie O.: Much obliged... . J.R.L.: The
Bulletin’s Old contributor “Burglar Bill” was a
much more interesting crook. One of his bits of
advice was, “Trust us least when we are most sin-
cere”. .. .Pensulo: Your railing against people who
deliver sermons is a sermon in 40 dreadful lines. .. .
G.L.D.: “Crucifixion” is unreal and unconvincing.
....John M.: Your operation verse fails. The doctor
may have knocked the tripe out of you, but why
send it to us? .Chirpy: No birdcage here for a
lady who is a dove merely because she has to rhyme
with “10ve”.... W.E.8.: “Tom Biddle’s Punch” takes
the knockout. .. .H.E.R.: “Unlucky Bracelets” doesn’t
grip M.C.K.: Your tale told vividly; but the
horror that is only a dream is worn out with over-
work... .M.W,: The tender fancy died in the office-
boy’s arms... .M.N.J.: Yours, alas! choked in an
attempt to rhyme “gaily” with “raillery” John
C.; Apostrophe to Australian bards rushed headlong
to the tomb.... Virginia V.: Not wishing to be un-
kind, we did not laugh at your “attempt at
humor” M.M. (Ch’ch): The humor is forced,
but a good climax might have got it through
Dell W.: Merely 4000 words.... 8.W.C.: “But the
knife was sharp, so hay is upthrown, and the snows
of yester year.” What is it all about? W.C.:
That earthquake kiss fails to move us... . Hine-te-
tama; You are the fifth this week to weep tears at
a graveside. The Bulletin isn’t a cemetery....
5.1.: Bold buccaneer! That picture of warriors at their
rest, barrels above their faces, and the spigots turned on
is alluring... . T.G.: Why the hot wrath against Pagan-
ism? Paganism is the foundation of one at least of
the creeds you appear to favor.... Ron H.: You have
a long track to travel, but you may get somewhere
when you have left bushrangers behind. Incidentally,
stories for Bulletin consumption should be written
in English, not American... .W.C.T.: Sorry. “Flight”
still does, not. soar easily enough.., .Wenga: Ex-
cellent ; but “I Saw Him First” would be a better
title : . ‘
He’s mine, you cannot. steal him, now ;
Although'you ; bear his name I claim his love.
. I knew him,ffirlt,' I Ipved him best;
You bear his'fiapie, 1 claim his heart,
And though I have no right to bear his name
• I hold him ; fast, in loVes and. feel no shame. '
We loved not wisely but too well
Without him now my life is Hell.
. ... J.E.D. (Montana) :Is travelling in America really
so dull? Only stirring incident in 1000 words is
the purchase of’a Ford truck for 40 dollars. Verse
not up to standard. .. .Teller: You are wrong in say-
ing your “idol was of clay.” It is wooden
C. 0.: “Thou” and “thy” are a hopeless handicap for
your light Pegasus. The Bulletin abandoned the
Quaker religion in its infancy H.R.: Crushed
to death under the weight of its trite adjectives.
F-W-N.: You miss a thrillful story in a tangle
of words. .. .P.G.: “Death was inevitable; but he
saw several means by which it might be avoided.”
Still, the inevitable sometimes happens. .. .L.T.:
Your comedy of errors is a tragedy of grammar. ...
0.F.: In a verse of set form you should be more
careful with your rhymes Mglthus: Your eugenist
yarn seems to be inspired by ■' Wells, even down to
the dots. .. .G.0.A.: Pretty little story, not in
The Bulletin’s line. May do elsewhere.... Gipsy
K.: The little fairies’ feet need dancing lessons.
Study scansion... ,D.A.: That simple last line “Oh!
—Oh!—Oh!” dissolved us in tears. Be more cheer-
ful.... K.C.: “Faith” failed in the last few lines.
Otherwise a smooth, well-versed first attempt
Omer; Both just fail E.J.: Too slight Don
G.: No; it is not “on the same lines as Poe.” Poe
had a definite theory of the melodic value of different
consonant and vowel sounds; he built his tinkles
on that. Your imitation is merely tinkle Zulu:
Your geography is rickety. Stonehenge is 10 miles
north of Salisbury, and Amesbury is two miles east
of Stonehenge Country P.; Yes, yes, the fact has
long been obvious; the thing now is to suggest a
Cl!l ' e Johnny: Too horrible Bellerive: Now this
is something more than poetry—it is biography too:
In the day’s of my youth a. fascination for me
Had the wide and boundless rippling sea.
Away from the city with its traffic and din
1 d watcheth the waves roll out and in
I loved toi gaze at a distant ship
Clearing her way on an outward trip
In the days of my youth recreation to me
las to muse on the beach by the riopling sea:
Upon the wondrous work of the great Divine
With rapture I’d gaze till the stars did shine.
Dave R.: Just fails; perhaps you’ve left out
too much—a rare defect C. McE.: Fair yarn;
but the material won’t carry it that far T.T.R.:
There are a few splinters in “Easy Chair” that want
attention. Shift, them and it should pass. .. .Mews:
You re mistaken. Liverpool has nearly three times
the shipping tonnage of Glasgow 8.W.C.: Too
much of the ground has been covered already
°M L.: Over-effusive... .O'RB.; Well, both those
oontilbutors had over three years’ active service
Marjorie P.; Not at all badly done, but rather sloppy.
....F.G.H.: Very nearly. Glad to hear from vou
again....M.G.: Sure you’ve got the ages right?
Both men were given more years than that ».s W:l
papers... .F.S.H.: It’s too hard to swallow... NW.:
rouve made poor use of your materials L. Teigh:
it s almost as great a surprise as porridge at an
Aberdeen breakfast.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) i
CORRESPONDENTS.
P.P.Iv.: Drawn from memory, is it ? Better lose
your memory... .8.L.1v.: Amateurish .K.U.F.: Still
on the outer. . . .A.T.G.That sort of thing has to be
well done to get through J.K.: The child has
legs like a drainpipe and a walrus moustache....
A.IV.L.: Show it to the man himself, but take a
military guard with y0u.... J.C.H.: Barely recognis-
able E.j;C.: Silhouettes are too often a sanctuary
for the muddle handed... .A.M.C.: A whirlwind of
confused lines... .A.C.G.: No wonder the curate is
embarrassed. Look at all he has to choose from
R.C.W.: Our process-engraver will be grey-haired
befoie he ever makes a block of your drawings.
“Northerner”: Unc. Sam’s traffic with
Queensland is one-way. Bananaland’s other
customers, with few and unimportant excep-
tions., buy far more than they sell (the United
Kingdom buys more than twice as much),
but the wily Yank spends only a few cents
for every dollar he receives. For the year
1924-25 Queensland’s imports from U.S.A.
were £3,265,835; exports only £240,166
and not all Australian goods at that.

“Nikko”: An Australian firm recently
ordered a large consignment of blotting-
paper from Japan. The Jap decided to
make the goods look as English as possible,
so copied the watermark of some foreign
paper he had on hand. Thus the consign-
ment arrived with the blotting-paper all
branded “Warranted Non-absorbent.”
* * * *
“Centurion”: The recent consignment of
valuable pearls from Broome to Perth by
aeroplane has caused a lot of more or less
self-satisfied comment on the safety of air
routes for the conveyance of cargo of this
sort. It is prophesied that thefts of jewels
and money in transit will soon become a
thing of the past, thanks to the ’plane,
flying far above bushrangers and hold-up
gangs. And so it may for a time, perhaps,
but when rich booty begins to fly regularly
through the air it is a dead certainty that the
thief will take wings and go after it. ’Planes
are in constant use in the United States,
smuggling liquor over the Mexican and
Canadian borders, and the prohibition force
is preparing to meet these with fighting
’planes. It is only a short step to the
highwayman of the air.
» « « «
“Hotham”: Next in importance to the
bootlegging industry in the Benighted States
comes the profession of selling bogus oil-
shares. Its members, cheerfully referred to by
their fellow-countrymen as “clean-collar ban-
dits,” lately descended on England, led by
Jacob Factor. Scotland Yard briefly told
Jacob and his minions to move on, and they
obeyed—couldn’t do much else. Jacob was
last heard of in Paris, and as he has com-
plained bitterly that the Commonwealth
Postal Regulations had already nipped an
attempt to carry on swindling by correspon-
dence in Australia, it is possible he may try
the personal touch in this country. It may
be only a coincidence that numerous adver-
tisements for smart men to sell shares on
commission have been appearing in the Syd-
ney and Melbourne dailies recently.
* * * #
“Cartot”: Although the Commonwealth
Government is fairly liberal in the matter
of rewards to outside informers, it becomes
parsimonious where its own servants are
concerned. It is in the Customs Department
that the distinction is most noticeable. It
is not uncommon for £lOO to be paid for
information leading to the seizure of opium;
one informer collected as much as £3OO in a
single case. Yet officers of the Department
are seldom paid more than a few pounds
for seizures, although the latter may have
entailed much difficult work in the officer’s
own time. The capture of one of the biggest
opium “plants” on record, worth thousands
of pounds, was rewarded by a bonus of less
than £25 to the officer who made the haul,
and in another case an employee who un-
earthed about £2OOO worth of the drug was
paid £5. If their salaries were good this
wouldn’t be amiss; but, as a rule, the pay is
miserable.
* * * *
“Naklioda”: Broadway millionaires are
booking up again for another world-cruise
which will include Australia. The Franco-
nia is to be the jewelled raft, and suites will
cost £2500. Also there is another jaunt in
view for the Carintliia, which was here a
couple of months ago. It seems to me Aus-
tralia ought to do better out of these gilded
excursionists. One passenger on the Carin-
thia got his pocket picked in Melbourne, but
nearly all complained bitterly of the absence
of satisfactory means of getting rid of their
surplus cash. Americans are frantic buyers
of “mementoes of the country.” Returning
from Asiatic lands, they load their luxury-
ships to the gunwale with brass Buddhas
made in Birmingham and Dyak headhunters’
swords with the Sheffield brand erased.
Admittedly we have little in that line to offer
enthusiastic curio-hunters, but plenty of
craftsmen are doing interesting work with
Australian motifs, and it ought to be more
conspicuous in our shops.
* * * #
“Kriz” : The diving-dress in use among the
Japs working the shell beds off Broome
hasn’t changed since its introduction in 1887.
Pearlers w r orking the Thursday Island shell
beds, getting wind of the rich deposits along
the Nor’-Westralian coast, sailed round, and
in King’s Sound, about 80 miles north of
Broome, started operations, that being the
first time diving-dress was used in those
waters. Previous to that natives were em-
ployed in hand-picking the shell at low tide.
An American sailor and his partner were
the pioneers in getting the natives to dive for
shell. Gradually they taught them to “bob
under” for it, and in 1868, with a party of
natives aboard, the first experiment in diving
from a boat was made with much success.
The natives soon became expert in going
under and frequently to depths which at
that time were considered to be the limit for
naked diving. One pearler with a party of
40 native divers averaged 25 tons of shell
annually. And they were allowed by regula-
tion to shell only between the months of
September and April.
» * * #
“Sixenate”: Retailers who employ their
own house detectives to guard against shop-
lifting find themselves confronted by a new
danger. A woman was caught in the act of
lifting an article of little value, and, being
unable to explain her possession of the goods,
was duly handed over to a detective and
charged. Brought before a Sydney police
court, she produced the firm’s sale docket,
along with the explanation that, when ques-
tioned in the shop, she was too confused to
think of it. The case was dismissed, and the
lady promptly sued for damages for wrong-
ful arrest, claiming £lOOO, which the jury
cut in halves. The firm, ruefully considering
the matter, has been forced to the conclusion
that nothing is easier for a dishonestly-
inclined person than to legitimately buy an
article and secure a sale-docket, and then,
having got rid of the article, to return and
steal something of the same sort for the
purpose of being caught. Other firms are
remembering similar cases in which they
have have had to pay up and feel unplea-
sant ; and there is a common puzzlement
as to how such a plot can be countered.

The drawing takes place at Sydney
,Town Hall on May 13, 1926.
The 40,000 Queenslanders who failed to
vote at the Federal election are still sending
in replies to the “Please explain” of the
electoral officers, The best to date was that
of a man who wrote from Boggo-road: “I
could not vote because I was in gaol.” The
excuse was accepted.
The Industrial Council of the Barrier
has laid it down that one man must
have one job only, even if it is too small
a job to keep a whole man. What it would
do to a Labor Premier who is also a com-
pany director and an estate-agent this pa'per
doesn’t profess to know.
Forty Sydney Easter Shows have been seen
by A. D. Playfair, who as a boy picked up
his first R.A.S. prize, a bronze medal, with
a buggy-horse exhibit. He has never missed a
Show since, and after being ringmaster for
many years is now vice-president and a life
member.
A girl who has broken into a field that
has hitherto been regarded as a male pre-
serve is Beryl Rosser, of Warwick (Q.).
Miss Rosser, who is just over 21, drives her
own car for hire, and thinks nothing of a
200-mi-le journey at a few minutes’ notice,
even should it entail starting in the middle
of the night.
Queensland's Labor Premier was annoyed
when a disgruntled follower accused him of
getting too big for his boots. Boots are a
serious subject to McCormack. He is a big
fellow, and takes an outsize; in fact, he is
so far out of the stock sizes that he has to
get his boots made to measure. He takes
pride in the fact that they are Queensland-
made. They cost him four guineas a pair—
and most of it goes in leather.
“Stellsby” : Vic. Commissioner Clapp has
issued a proclamation barring from railway-
platforms all intending passengers who are
blotto. Tha edict was long overdue. Week-
end and holiday travellers on the bayside
trains should now enjoy a measure of com-
fort, and second-class passengers on long-
distance trains may be spared the annoyance
of over-familiar or quarrelsome drunks wan-
dering stupidly along the corridors looking
for the pub.
“F.R.”: The postman who collects the
letters from pillar-boxes in our suburb assures
me that many people “post” purses, hand-
bags and such-like every year. In most cases
the articles are carried with the letters to the
pillar-box and slipped in unthinkingly.
Prayer-books, handkerchiefs, bank-books and
spectacles are also among my informant’s
common finds; at times he comes on jewel-
lery. On one occasion a wedding-ring was
encountered, having slipped off the owner’s
finger while she was posting a letter. The
loss was advertised, so the postal authorities
were able to return it.
Nineteen years ago, when the State
Licenses Reduction Board was created, there
were 3507 pubs and 1313 other establish-
ments for the sale of spirituous and fer-
mented in Vic. There are now only 1914
public-house and 994 other licenses, and
344 of the “others” are spirit merchants. Just-
on 1600 bars have therefore been wiped out.
In ’O7 there was a pub to every 352 people;
now there is one to every 880. And the
number of persons arrested for drunkenness
slumped from 10,994 in ’O7 to 7221 in ’24 —
8.93 per 1000 of population to 4.40. In
commonsense liquor reform Victoria has cer-
tainly led the world.
W. M. Hughes is not broken-hearted be-
cause Neville, Howse is going to the High
Commissionership. He is enjoying an Indian
summer of better health than he has had
for many years. Hughes directed the affairs
of the nation during the Great War on a
diet mainly of biscuits and water, but the
soothing existence of a private member has
considerably restored his assimilative appara-
tus. He reposes nowadays on memories of
past greatness. One of them concerns an
occasion when he was dining in New York
with a tableful of magnates. He asked the
wife of a steel millionaire whether prohibi-
tion had been a success. “Success!” ex-
claimed the lady. “I should just say it
had. Why, half my husband’s workmen
used never to turn up on a Monday. Now
they all do !” . Then she helped herself to the
third cocktail.
“James B.”: Some years ago two Italians
opened a restaurant in a N.S.W. western
town, and their cuisine soon began to attract
custom. Their specialty was pies, and the
general opinion was that their productions
knocked those of other local piemen endways.
Their fame spread, and it seemed as if they
were on the highway to fortune and their
competitors to bankruptcy when one of the
latter struck a dramatic blow at the Dago
enterprise. He chose for it a Saturday night,
when the railwaymen, who bulk largely in
the town, were off duty and Pedro’s shop
was crowded with patrons consuming their
favorite delicacy. Walking nonchalantly in
with a bag on his shoulders, the emissary of
the enemy dumped its contents—half a dozen
dead cats —on the counter with the re-
mark: “Here, Pedro, this is all I could get
to-night.” Pedro spluttered indignant pro-
tests, but his patrons were in no mood to
listen to explanations. They rose as one
man, and the stronger-stomached, after chas-
ing the proprietors into the street, proceeded
to wreck the premises. At midnight Pedro
and his mate caught a Sydney-bound train
seven miles out.
“Topee”: Comment on the Mcllrath fire
(B. 25/3/’2G) recalls the firm’s predecessor
and the enormous business he built up over
50 years ago. The late James Kidman (an
ex-n.c.o. in an Imperial regiment quartered
in Sydney), starting with a small shop in
Oxford-street, secured eventually all the Gov-
ernment food contracts. In the Sydney dis-
trict alone there were the Victoria Barracks,
the well-filled Darlinghurst Gaol, Callau
Park and Gladesville hospitals, and various
asylums, without mentioning Easter volun-
teer and unemployed camps; and there was
no end of a row over some of the methods
he employed to make the going good. The
heir who succeeded to the business soon dis-
posed of it, but during his ownership he was
a keen advertiser. One of his stunts was to
order an enormous Christmas cheese to be
sent up from the South Coast per bullock-
dray, daily progress reports being posted in
the windows. These and, later, the sight of
an expert ’monger cutting up the cheese,
which contained prize tokens, used to block
traffic in the then narrow Oxford-street. In-
cidentally. a daughter of James Kidman mar-
ried a former Premier, John See.

J NOW Better titan
ever before
Dodge Brothers, Inc., an-
nounced in January astonish-
ingly new and lower prices.
Important refinements in their
product were also announced.
Always building an
exceptional car, they are now
building better than ever.
Better in many ways—in
beauty, comfort, driving
vision, engine smoothness,
snap, elasticity and getaway.
The simultaneous offering of
lower prices and vital improve-
ments was made possible by
a ten-million-dollar (U.S.G.)
expansion of buildings and
equipment.
This additional investment
has permitted great savings,
through vastly increased
volume and efficiency.
Part of these savings goes
into further betterment of
the car. The other part
goes directly back to the
buyer—in the form of sub-
stantial price reductions.
Those who chose Dodge
Brothers Motor Car in the
past invested their money
wisely.
To-day they invest more
wisely than ever before.

Girls! Have You Soft,
White, Attractive Hands?
What greater attraction is it possible for any girl to have than soft, white, attrac-
tive hands ? For the hands are to the body like the index to the book. Beautiful hands
amply pay for the care and time used in keeping them beautiful, and care is all that is
necessary'for developing and retaining beautiful hands.
When washing the hands, any soap will not do; only a specially-prepared soap which
entirely free from alkali, and one which keeps the hands in perfect condition, should be used.
Such a soap is Rexona Soap, so" if you would have beautiful hands start at once by using only
Rexona Soap daily, and you will be delighted with the results, for Rexona Soap is
luxury that any lady of discrimination must appreciate.

My Garden.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
i S ChineseVpoetry —to Western eyes
/\ ragged scroll most wonderful with
-L* flowers,
Dark boughs and limpid lakes philosophies
Of bird and bee and symbols fine as jade
Flecked with the dancing shadows of bam-
So grows my garden. Through a window
To nigged hills where wind-torn fir-trees
It looks upon an oclire-colored wall
That bears pale imprint of the centuries.
There one wet spray of ivy claws the air,
And blue delphiniums fade along the stone
Of steps that seem to lead to an abyss.
There is no seeming method in the place
Bronze zinnias burn amongst the cobbled
ways;
A single spire of blue forget-me-not
Stabs through the desert of the sanded path.
Instead of hedges grows a wilderness
Of white-boled gums, while, on a green-
lipped pool,
A painted duck amid the dragon-flies
Shows cinnamon and black against the reeds.
You would walk in my garden? Ah, my
friend,
I cannot even find the gate to-day.
Perhaps I lost that garden in a dream—
A shutter clicked, a hand unseen has drawn
A blind across the window; but I know
A bird flew out of it towards the hills!
QUEENSLAND.

[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
“TT is a sporting chance,” said Leslie
earnestly; “and in any case we can’t
lose financially. You hire the diver
and gear. I find the cutter. The wreck is
there. Toby could just glimpse . it at his
deepest dive. It must be an ancient craft.
There are no records. I don’t say there is
treasure aboard, but it will be strange if she
doesn’t carry material sufficient to repay us
for the very moderate outlay on the jaunt.
By the time you pay holiday expenses to
Melbourne and back to Thursday Island
you’ll find it will cost you as much as. the
diver’s fees. Make this jaunt your holiday
instead. Even if the wreck turns out a com-
plete dud, we’ll make money. We’ll employ
the diver at pearl-shelling. He’ll be able to
dive much deeper than my native crew, and
we’ll work ground I’ve been unable to touch
before. We’ll return loaded with pearl-shell,
and, at its present price, it is as good as
treasure.”
“H’m,” said Peters uncertainly; “sounds
all right. But I’m a business man with a
reputation. How the North would laugh if
I went Spanish galleon-hunting. If there
was only a successful precedent, now.”
“Got you!” said Leslie triumphantly.
“There is a precedent. All the North knows
about Jardine, of Somerset, and the £3OOO-
- of Spanish and Mexican dollars he re-
covered off the Fingerpoint coast.”
“By Jove!” exclaimed Peters. “I’d for-
gotten. I’ll go. But for Heaven's sake give
out that we’re merely cruising for shell with
a properly-equipped diver aboard.”
* * * *
Far-stretching water, calm and lagoon-
green, sparkling wdth sunrays. The wooded
Torres isles, clear-cut and pretty. The
cutter moveless, and yet seeming a living
thing capable of foaming life should quick
need arise.
In happy curiosity the blackboys grouped
around the “Syd-nee man,” Burton, donning
the diving-dress. Leslie was about to adjust
the helmet when the diver’s half-gesture
halted him. Burton looked around as if
loath to leave the beauty of the world.
Almost shyly he glanced up at the immensity
that receded beyond eyesight in a superb
arch of blue. There was no limit to the
sky; a man could fly through it for ever
and still gaze into illimitable space, while at
his feet lived a world into which lie could
not see and into which he would disappear
in the space of minutes. With an impatient
smile he signalled for the helmet.
Under Leslie’s supervision the boys stood
by the air-pump. The diver stepped over-
side. Slowly his cumbrous body disappeared ;
lastly the grotesque dome of the helmet.
Stray air-bubbles arose. Slow ripples.
wavered to the cutter’s side. Like a coffin
of lead gently sinking, the diver faded into
the darkening waters along the reef-edge. A
blackboy leaning overside, his eyes wide
astrain, gasped as the indistinct blob merged
like a blot of ink into the ocean.
Burton slipped down into silence. The
wreck lay at the extreme limit of diving
depth. Warily his boots came to rest on a
shell-encrusted beam. Experience directed his
eyes upwards. Quite unfouled, the air-pipe
and life-line stretched up through opaqueness
into greenness, to merge into yellow-green
towards the surface. He could distinguish
the cutter’s keel quite distinctly, and gazing
up as through many fathoms of gradually-
lightening glass he saw a dull red coin float-
ing in dimmest blue —the sun. The experi-
ence was new and beautiful. He was within
a vast crevice between two narrowing reefs
of coral. Where the chasm had narrowed the
old wreck had caught. The sun’s rays shoot-
ing down directly overhead had concentrated
within the chasm walls and enabled him to
see almost clearly even at this great depth.
This was Burton’s first trip into the sea
of the corals, and the vague beauties therein
were fascinating. Already, high up around
the life-lines, darted a cloud of inquisitive
fish, more wondrous than the shimmer of
parrots through sunlight. The creamy walls
rising on either side were like half-forgotten
dreams of mediaeval battlements by moon-
light.
A thing like a floating gossamer veil emerged
from the gloom and vanished. Burton noted
it—a maze of cells of recurring pin-pricks
of light—and sensed that its seeming help-
lessness really held power and purposeful life.
Grotesque vegetable growths flaunted from
the thousand coral crannies. Actually, many
were trees, with queer tapering stems, that
sinuously swayed where there was not the
slightest movement of the water. Many were
plants of nightmare form and flowers that
would be unexpected even in a garden of
dreams. He stared as a cabbage of green
transformed itself into petals of white and,
unfolding, displayed a heart of yellow alive
with a phosphorescent glow. An eel-shaped
fish nosed towards the brilliance, and in-
stantly the petals whipped around it and
closed. The fish’s disappearing tail wriggled
frantically as the clenching petals dulled
back to green.
Burton glanced at the wreck. Hardly a
wreck! Merely the skeleton of what had
once been a wreck, its few ribs clothed with
life of'the sea. And it looked so dead. In
a world that was so unutterably silent, but
so alive.
He glanced up. The life-lines were all
correct. Cautiously he clambered among the
timbers, seeking for the hold. _ Certainly the
ship might have been a Spanish galleon; it
had no shape left to hint at what it once was,
but it seemed so old that but for its size
it could have been a craft of the Norsemen.
Within the helmet he smiled. A comradely
smile. Though spreading from the sliell-
encrusted muzzle there waved a riotous. floral
growth, he recognised the dropping thing as
an old-time cannon, its muzzlp pointing for-
lornly towards the eartli-w T orld from which it
had come.
The wreck was not so very old, after all.
At least only a few hundred years. Those
few centuries were a bond of sympathy be-
tween man and ship. But this drear world of
the fishes must have lived on for ever and
ever. . .
Very slowly Burton worked his way along,
with an eerie feeling that if he slipped off
the timbers and coral arms he would sink
straight down through the greenness into a
bottomless pit of ink.
A long shadow swept past and, lithely
turning, came again. Burton was not afraid
of sharks, but this fellow’s movements were
menacing. Its cold-green eyes spoke of things
unthinkable. It circled close until it almost
twisted in its own length, as if reluctant to
keep its jaws from claiming this new thing
that was rightfully its.
Burton had met inquisitive sharks before,
but he disliked this one immediately. It
was so plainly going to attempt a kill; so
obviously regarded the diver as its own. His
hand touched the air-release valve. A spray
of hissing bubbles gushed surfacewards. The
shark dived convulsively and was gone.
Within his helmet Burton laughed. After
all, sharks in the coral reefs were as cowardly
as those of the harbors farther south. He
ambled on, reassured.
A bloated growth like a monster balloon
waved before him, all rainbow jelly, but
throbbing with life. He touched it. Its
colors dimmed to water-green, and it slowly
disappeared within itself. Amazed, Burton
watched the big thing until, small as a gar-
den pea, it vanished within a crevice of coral.
He stared. From a cavern a head watched
him, a hideous head and moveless. It stared
with unblinking eyes, more cruel by far than
the eyes of any snake. Barton recollected
pearlers’ tales of the giant groper, of how
they’d been known at a single bite to snap
off the leg of a diving blackboy.
That monstrous head was a menace.
Mentally and perhaps physically. It waited
within a cavern just above the centre of the
wreck. Burton touched the air-valve. The
bubbles hissed up. The head never moved.
Something else did. A huge frightened fish, ,
tiger-striped, darted past the cavern. Burton
visioned the instant opening of rounded jaws,
the gleam of many teeth. They snapped,
and head and tail of the striped fish floated
down towards him.
Burton reflected that these brute fish must
be scared of him. The diving-dress made him
a hideous monster too. What he did not
know was that this cruellest of all the
things that breathe cared not at all for
hideousness. He did not know its calm
reliance upon certain slender things stretch-
ing far up to the unknown, endless ten-
tacles that might envelop its prey in a trap.
Burton let the big eyes watch him, because
he could do nothing else.
He peered below his feet and saw that all
hope of treasure had long sinee gone. The
bottom was out of the wreck. Its sliell-
encrusted ribs were only held together by
the marine growths that had spread between.
Then Burton stared amazed, for swim-
ming, really swimming, came a beautiful
sight. A fish of wonder colors, with its scales
flaming in a thousand phosphoric lights. It
resembled a far-off ocean liner bathed in
electric glow skimming a black sea. Even
at the great depth he could see in the phos-
phoric haze the prettily-shaped head. He
drew a slow breath of disappointment as the
waters again closed solid. Far down flashed
a rosy light. It disappeared and shone again.
Then flashed straight across the crack and
vanished. Burton only sensed the shape of
the fish, and that growing up from its head
there bent a supple rod over the snout which
flashed a little light. Just a lure for in-
quisitive prey.
Something floated down through the crack
above him. Like a broad, green blanket
tasselled with gold sinking slowly through
the depths, it covered nearly the width of
the huge crack and its mass of hair-like edges
drooped prettily and wavered.
“A cloud must be over the sun,” thought
Burton as he straightened up. The cloud
enveloped him, utterly and softly, and its
folds draped around him and closed him in
caressingly but ardently, as if impelled by
a love that would never be denied.
He stood in utter darkness, not compre-
hending. Then he felt as if he were being
squeezed by suddenly-increased water pres-
sure at great depth. Fearfully his arms
swung out. His clawing hands quite easily
tore through a silken mane of hair just cosily
damp. His arms swung again and went
through quite freely, and again, and again,
and again as h<e clumsily spun around. But
he felt the pathways torn by his arms in-
stantly filled lip, and sensed that soon it
would demand toil to thrust his arms through
this jelly-like hair. He struggled frantically,
and the hair, slipping through his clawing
hands, silkily caressed his fingers and felt
reluctant to slip away.
He paused with thudding heart and shud-
dering brain. How intensely dark it was!
And what a weight was closing around him!
He was encased as if in wet cement that
was fast setting.
He nerved himself to stand absolutely still
and think. So many years of diving experi-

YOU May Have
Kidney Trouble!

There is good cause to suspect your kidneys if
you have any stubborn pain in the small of the
back; for that is just where the kidneys are.
Heavy, throbbing backache
and sharp twinges when you
stoop or give your back a sud-
den twist tell you of inflamed
kidneys; kidneys sore, over-
worked and tired.
The kidneys have enough to
do when you are in good health
to filter the blood free of uric
poisons. Colds, fevers, over-
work or excesses of any sort
congest and overwork the kid-
neys. Unless promptly relieved,
what was at first a simple inflam-
mation will turn, in time, to
gravel, urinary trouble, dropsy,
lumbago, sciatica, rheumatism,
or some chronic form of kidney
disease.
If your kidneys are weak, take
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
the remedy that has been used
for over fifty years and is so
well recommended by people
from all parts of Australia.
DON’T BE PUT OFF—
INSIST ON DOAN’S.
SYDNEY RESIDENT
CURED.
Mr. A. Bartle, No. 3 Gladstone
Street, Bexley, Sydney, says:—“Off
and on for years I suffered with dis-
ordered kidneys, the result being that
I was tortured with backache. When I
had a bad attack my back used to be
so stiff and lame that I could not even
turn in bed without suffering agony.
The kidney secretions were affected, be-
ing thick and cloudy with a red sedi-
ment. I was also subject to dizzy
attacks, and generally speaking felt far
from well. One day a friend, hearing
of a cure by Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills, urged me to try them. I bought
some without delay, and used them with
excellent results. The first bottle gave
relief, and five bottles made a complete
and perfect cure.”
Eight years later Mrs. Bartle says:
“Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
my husband of backache and kidney
trouble over eight years ago, and he has
had no return of the complaint since.”

keepers at 2/9 per bottle, or from

PILES AND ECZEMA CURED
BY DOAN’S OINTMENT.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
Eczema Cured.
Mrs. Horwitz, Ethelwood, Hayward
Street, Kensington, Sydney, says :—“I
sent for a pot of Doan’s Ointmefit, and
used it for Eczema on my little girl’s
forehead. The rash covered the brow
and it was around the eye as well. The
itching was frightful, and it made her
very fretful and kept her from sleeping.
I had used several preparations previous
to getting Doan’s Ointment, but none of
them gave more than passing relief. I
am pleased to tell you that this remedy
cured her completely. We have since
used it on another little girl with
equally good results. Doan’s Ointment
is splendid, and I advise its use in all
itching skin diseases.”
Eighteen years later Mrs. Horwitz
states : —“My daughter has not suffered
with Eczema since Doan’s Ointment
cured her eighteen years ago.”
Piles Cured.
Mrs. M. Brown, Toronto, Lyons Road,
Five Dock, Sydney, says : —“Three years
ago I used Doan’s Ointment for a bad
attack of Piles, and I am pleased to tell
you it completely cured me. Previous to
trying this ointment I tried all kinds of
remedies; but they gave me little or no
relief. I was suffering terribly when I
first applied Doan’s Ointment, and had
little hope of it doing me any good; but
its soothing and healing effects were
noticeable almost at once, and by the
time I had used one pot I was com-
pletely cured. I am a great believer in
Doan’s Ointment, and consider it the
best Pile remedy known. It cured me
after other remedies had failed.”
Four years later Mrs. Brown says:—
“I have had no return of my old com-
plaint since Doan’s Ointment cured me
about seven years ago.”

once had taught him —what? That now at
200 feet he was at the greatest depths. Only
slight exertion meant quick physical exhaus-
tion. But to struggle—why that meant the
brain must go almost immediately. In every
such case a cool head meant the only way
out of a crisis.
Gently his hand searched to his breast for
the signal-cord. It pushed through the outer
hair, which closed caressingly around his
hand. It had become much harder to push
through around the corselet; it was a thick
mass; it was just like pushing through
thickening cheese. His fingers spread and
twisted as they tried to poke a way around
the cord. Like claws they coiled around and
dug an inch into the hair enwrapping the
cord. It was compressing and becoming in
turn harder to compress. His fingers closed,
but it was a.s if around a stiff rubber tube.
He could not close on the cord!
And the hairy mass was squeezing around
his wrist and arm. He felt his fingers
gripped already as in thickening glue. He
tried and tried and tried to jerk. .Tust as
his brain gained control he staggered forward
into the hold of the wreck and his weight
stfetched the cord.
As they hauled him up through the shal-
lower wmter down which 1 the sun’s rays shone,
a cloth of gold like finest seaweed quickly
but without haste unwound from around him.
It spread and grew until it was a dense
blanket of gently waving hair. It slid off,
and, as if a thing of dreamy life, floated, ten-
drils prettily waving, down into the depths.
I. L. IDRIESS.
The Deluge of Animals.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was raining as it can rain in the Nor-
West after a dry spell. The water
sluiced down in solid chunks and
drummed on the iron roof of the boundary-
rider’s hut with a continuous roar.
“It’s rainin’ pitchforks end down’ard,” re-
marked a young kangarooer who had dropped
in for shelter.
“She is rainin’ a few,” rumbled Water-
mulga Bill, who belonged to the hut and
had looked after this God-forsaken back-end
of a cattle-station for so many years that
he was fully qualified to suspend corks
around the brim of his hat. “Maybe,” he
continued pensively, “you’ve heard of it
rainin’ cats an’ dogs; but have any of yiz
ever heard tell of it rainin’ cattle and sheep
an’ every other sort of animal ingenious to
Australia?”
He paused and threw several lengths of
gnarled karara wood into the fire-bucket.
The blaze lit up the bare tin walls, orna-
mented with figures drawn in charcoal by
idle wayfarers, and the, rugs, tucker-bags
and saddle gear scattered about the earthen
floor or piled on the rough shelves. The blaze
also threw into prominence Bill’s solemn
face, ragged grey beard and vivid eyes.
“I on’y seen it onct,” he assured us pre-
sently, when we had murmured in our several
ways that such a sight seemed passing
strange ; “an’ I’m willin’ to lay yiz odds on
that they ain't no other bloke’s ever seen it.”
I declined the bet, knowing Bill; the kan-
garooer said nothing.
“ ’Way back in ’92 it happened,” he went
on, “when I was workin’ up north for a
cove be the name of McGlue. An injenyus
bloke he was, always inventin’ some con-
demned thing or other; an’ he’d a room full
of bottles an’ all manner of strange gear
where he’d raise stinks as’d make a’ abo.
sick.
“One day this ’ere cove come up to me
carryin’ a bottle.
“ ‘Bill,’ says he, ‘I wmnt yiz to get in a
killer from Round Well paddock. Them
cattle out there is pretty fresh, so I got a
noo dodge as’ll save the horses. D’ye gig
this here bottle?’ says he. ‘Yes,’ says I.
‘Well,’ says he, ‘if a bullock gets a smell
of this here stuff he’ll foller it to Hell. All
you gotta do when yiz sight a mob is to
pour a few drops on your horse’s rump an’
hit the road for home. They’ll come in
arter you without no trouble.’
“This looked good to me, so I grabbed the
bottle an’ hooked it, winkin’ at the cook an’
tappin’ my head as I went. After a few'
hours I got out there, had my scran an’ a
smoke, saddled up again an’ fastened on to
the tracks of a mob of beeves.
“Presently I sighted the mob —big cock-
horned steers, wfild as hares. Soon as they
see me they was off, me after ’em. Puttin’
the hooks in, I pulled out the cork an’
poured on the stuff as I went. Terrible
powerful smell it had; but not onpledhant.
“After a bit of a gallop I k got on their
flank an’ wheeled them. Then suddintly I
seen I’d made a mistake about that stuff.
Them wild cock-liorned steers no sooner got
my scent than they turned, all together, like
a mob o’ green parrots in spring, an’ started
after me hell for leather, lowin’ deep like
a perishin’ mob when they scent water.
“I galloped, standin’ in my stirrups, with
them poundin’ an’ roarin’ behind. Then I
run into another mob, an’ another, till I’d
a hundred head behind me. Then a mob
of brumbies joined up; an’ blow my eyes if
they soon ain’t mobs of kangaroos an’ emus
an’ wallabies, and, finially, donks and camels,
tearin’ along the flanks an’ bringin’ up the
rear.
“ ‘This here’s a bit too willin’,” says I to
meself, but still I galloped on —nothin’ else
tt» do, d’ye see. An’ all the time they was
joinin’ my little band of ’ope in packs an’
droves an’ flamin’ mobs. Dingoes an’ bandi-
coots an’ rabbits an’ sheep an’ wallabies come
in: there mighter been grasshoppers, beetles,
bugs an’ centipe’es, too, but I didn’t notice
’em.
“Arter a while I’d a gig over my shoulder,
an’ bli’ me if they wasn’t a promiskus mob
coverin’ a face half a mile wide be about a
mile deep. They was hee-hawin’, bellerin’,
barkin, an’ generally raisin’ hell’s delight.
They fairly put the wind up me, so I tore
the hooks into the old hairy, an’ galloped
an’ galloped, not worryin’ much which way
I went so long’s I got away from them mad
devils behind.
“At last my nag began to knock up, until
I could feel ’im rollin’ under me. He was
lathered with sweat, an’ the stones ’ud
knocked his feet about.
“The mob come closer an’ closer as we
slackened. They was such a sight as I
never want to see again. They was a solid
mass of animals, all goin’ like the trip ham-
mers of hell—horses an’ cattle an’ camels an’
the rest all mixed up in a roarin’ mill. A
mile wide they muster stretched acrost. God
on’y knows how far back they went.
“Soon I could hear the erashin’ of their
feet, an’ see their eyes an’ the sun gleamin’ on
the sharp horns of the cattle an’ the sweatin’
hides of the horses. They was very close.
My hair felt like it was forgettin’ the laws
of gravytation, an’ my bones knocked to-
gether.
“Now this here place I was workin’ on
had about a hundred miles of coastline, an’
this paddock was one of them alongside the
sea. Suddintly, on toppin’ a rise, I seen it
in front of me. An’ that ain’t all: there was
a cliff a hundred foot deep runnin’ all along
that there coast.
“I was on the ’orns of a cullysack, as they
say. I’d no chance. Them animals was too
close behind to think of turnin’. There was
on’y one thing to do, an’ I done it, though
I ain’t what you might call a bathing-man.
I went over the top, pickin’ a spot where
the cliff jutted out a bit. Over an’ over we
tumbled, turnin’ rings round one another,
and I thought of my poor old mother. The
sea riz up at an awful bat, an’ I hit it with
a bump like the kick of a ’orse, an’ under
I went, bound for Davy Jones’s locker with
a single ticket. Down an’ down an’ down
I went till I nearly bust, an’ there was all
the stars an’ a dozen moons corroboreein’
inside my head.
“But up I come again, an’ filled meself
with air an’ water, just as I felt like bustin’.
An’ then I seen a sight as I bet no one never
saw before nor ain’t likely to again. Them
animals was pushin’ one another over the
top into the sea. Down they come in hun-
dreds. They fell all round me, choppin’ up
the sea as if a storm was on. Mobs of cattle
an’ horses’d come skyrocketin’ down in little
bunches, an’ the small fry—-sheep an’ emus
an’ sichlike —come down like rain. Them
camels was the funniest ever I seen; he
ain't no fancy diver is the camel!
“Soon there was animals strugglin’ in a
lather of foana an’ spray everywhere: tread-
ing one another down, an’ bein’ flung be the
waves ag’in the black, slippery cl-iffs in
droves.
“I thought I w r as a goner, too, bein’ a
poor swimmer, d’ye see. But I grabbed the
tail of a big roan bull, with scars all over
his neck and withers an’ one horn missin’.
Jus' then a porcypine come flyin’ down an’
lobbed on ’is back. He lashed out all round
with his solitary horn »an’ swum like a
threshin’-machine with liydrophoby.
“Nex’ thing we was quarter of a mile out,
an’ there, in front of us, the old nag was
swimmin’ fer ’is natural with a long string
of cattle an’ horses still follerin’ him; ail
the other animals bein’ drownded, d’ye see.
“We swum till we jest about lost sight
of land; but lookin’ back I could still see
’em cornin’ over that cliff. The horse was
swimmin’ well ahead; with the mob, them
as hadn’t drownded, follerin’.
“Howsomevcr, they all begun to go under,
all goin’ down in the same place as they
come to it. Well, this caper fair knocked me
in; then, all of a suddint, I knoo what it
was. My old ’orse ’ad sunk, an’ the others
was still follerin’ it!
“ ‘God A’mighty!’ says I to meself, ‘this
here’s the end of yous.’ But I took a firm
grip of the reins, so to speak. Everything
was so blank quiet I could feel my skin
pricklin’ all over.
“We got nearer and nearer to the spot an’
I started to count the beasts in front. There
was six: a big red steer ahead, then four
horses, an’ a big crumple-horned heifer in
front of me.
“The roan come to the spot an’ dived.
Five left. Then an ’orse. Four left. An-
other one. Three left. T’other two horses
went down together, an’ there was on’y me
an’ my bull an’ the crumple-horned heifer in
all the wide ocean. Bli’me it was lonesome!
“At last the last of ’em w’ent down with
a gurglin’ splash, an’ me an’ the bull was
all alone in that there desert of water. It
ain’t likely I’ll ever forget it.
“We come nearer an’ nearer to the spot,
the bull still swimmin’ strong; an’ swelp
me if I can’t smell that dope strong, cornin’
up from the water. Wunnerful stuff it was:
too damn wunnerful.
“We come to the spot. Slowly the bull
begun to upend isself an’ went under.
“Then I had a brainwave, suddint, as
them things do strike a man sometimes. I
pulled the dope bottle from my pocket, took
the cork out with my teeth, an’ climbed down
the bull’s back. Then I held the bottle over
’is nose.
“He come up to it like a colt to the stock-
whip, an’ when he got to the top began to
roar like ole Bashem. Then, with ’is eyes
glarin’, he come at me an’ the bottle. But
I’d the pull over the bid blankard in the
water, d’ye see, an’ jest naturally slid over
’is horns, got comfortable acrost his back,
held the bottle in front 0f.... ’is nose, an’ hey
for a life on the ocean wave! as they say.
He ploughed along like a motor-car, goin’
like his first stop was America.
“Arter that things brightened up. I seen
a bit of a rock away on the near side an’
steered straight for it, usin’ the bottle as a
sorter rudder. We got there in no time.
“A fortnight later I was picked up be a
passm’ pearl lugger an’ got on shore safe
an’ sound, an’ then had the drunk of my life
at the town’s expense. It nearly settled me,”
he ended rather unexpectedly.
“How did yous manage to live on that
island fer a fortnight?” drawled the kan-
gerooer.
“Killed the bull an’ lived on him,” said the
old man. “Tough eating he was too. Sold
his skin after fer five quid.”
There was another long pause and one
could trace the course of the kangarooer’s
thoughts on his face, corrugated with un-
accustomed wrinkles.
“Is that all?” he inquired presently.
“Not quite,” replied Watermulga sadly, as
he slowly removed his elastic-sided boots and
crept between his rugs. “When I got back
the whole district was talkin’ about the way
the boss’d got tore to pieces by his kid’s
guinea-pigs. The secret of the dope died on
’im.”
Again he paused, and snuggled luxuriously
into his blankets. After knocking out my
pipe I followed suit. The kangarooer alone
continued to squat by the fire, his bronzed
face still thoughtful.
