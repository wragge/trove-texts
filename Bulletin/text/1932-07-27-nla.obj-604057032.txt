HIS BOOKS
Ghost Stories
Whenever the world is swept by a wave
of religious scepticism—a customary result
of the hopelessness engendered by the
miseries that follow great wars—it turns in
a kind of despair to magic. Necromancy
was a business when the Romans were
beginning to learn that Empire didn’t
mean social happiness, and had de-
posed their gods. Sidonian soothsayers
told fairy tales; the haruspex prophe-
sied; Chaldeans cast horoscopes; clever
Greeks invented Pythagorean wonders;
and they were all taken seriously, as
Cagliostro was in a later age, and as Mrs.
Robinson, of London, was shortly after
the Armistice. The craze knows no terri-
torial boundaries and it has never been
confined to illiterates. The late Mrs. Scales
of Sydney, made £40,000 by fortune-telling,
and a book on sorcery by Grillot de Givry
is now selling well at the equivalent of
35s. a copy in France. A number of well-
to-do folk tried to evoke the spectre of the
Brocken a few weeks ago, and Naomi
Royde-Smith, in the preface to her latest
book, claims to have seen ghosts. The
literature on the subject is naturally enor-
mous, but the output of the mystics is
tending to wear rather thin since the days
when “Malleus Maleficorum” was solemnly
discussed in Oxford Common Rooms, and
Scotland was burning half a dozen witches
and warlocks a week. Modern writers on
demonology display a certain poverty of
invention (nearly all their stories are
variants on ones that have been told better
before); and they are sometimes facetious
at the expense of the spirits, a practice
which would have been considered blas-
phemous by a previous generation. It is as
though they feel uneasily that the wheel
of scepticism has turned full circle, and
produced an age which doesn’t even be-
lieve in the traditional alternatives to un-
belief.
Old Friends in New Guises
Philip Allan has responded to the popular
demand with several books at 2s. 6d. each
called Tales of Horror, Ghosts and Ele-
mentals. The stories are well told, par-
ticularly those by H. R. Wakefield, who
manages to combine a light touch in the
early stages of his yarns with macabre
endings. “The Seventeenth Hole at Dun-
caster” is characteristic of/his method, and
also of a common type of English ghost
story. The Duncaster Golf Club decides to
lay out a new seventeenth in the middle of
a wood. A fairway is hacked through the
, trees at great expense, but as soon as
members begin playing to the. hole they
strike little unpleasantnesses. Lost balls,
and so on. No one does the hole under
five, and the club’s only scratch player takes
eight at his first attempt. One evening the
secretary hears a scream. The scratch man’s
mutilated body is found on the green. A
girl meets with a similar end. The green
is abandoned and the secretary takes a job
at another club where he learns the explan-
ation. The Druids!
A mound and an oak—such places are death-
nn? S ’ the time ; the peril is periodic.”
the belief that certain places bear the
curse of the Druids had prevailed in Eng-
land long before the seventeenth century,
when a prophylactic was discovered in Nor-
folk—-the fat of a white hen, the gall of a
black cat and the bloqd of a grey owl,
mixed at midnight in the dog-days, and
scattered over the fatal area.
Hundreds of thrillers have been written
m every language round those who under-
take to spend nights in haunted rooms.
A Wager and a Ghost,” bv Elliott
D Donnell, has an unexpected twist which
supplies whatever claim it possesses to
originality. The boastful De Garez, a
medical student at the college of St. Fern-
ando in Valladolid, undertakes for a bet
to spend a night in a dissecting-room. He
settles down with a bottle of Madeira and
a mastiff for whom his friends have left a
drugged biscuit. Diego, one of the prac-
tical jokers, is on a table wrapped up in
canvas like a corpse. In the morning
Diego is found dead, “a purplish mark
round his throat, and terror in his wide-open
eyes. Near him is another body, “only
partly, enveloped in its hideous canvas
wrapping”:—
Wh° what is it?” Hervacla whispered hoarsel”,
pointing’ to one of its Ions' arms. “See the fingers
a 'm I1 <! ; i> e they are almost touching Diego.”
Cortoza stuttered, crossing himself hastily,
tnat is Enrique Gertado thei murderer. He was
garrotted in the market square yesterday morning
and brought here in the afternoon for dissection.”
De Garez had slept
through it all,
having consumed
the mastiff’s bis-
cuit in addition to
his wine! “An Eye
for An Eye,” by
Charles Lloyd, is a tale of outrage. Conan
Doyle originated the formula. Revenge is
always the motive.
Most of the other themes are equally
familiar. In “Silent, White and Beautiful,”
by Tod Robbins, a criminal lunatic medi-
tates on the crime for which he is to be
executed next day, and in doing so reveals
what the crime was. “Cock-crow Inn,” by
the same writer, has an eighteenth-century
setting. Also a gibbet and a wild-eyed girl,
who breaks into song about the devil as she
crouches beneath a swinging form in a
black cloak—in short, all the morbid para-
phernalia of the period.
A Scientist Among the Spirits
The Strange Papers of Dr. Blayre, by
Christopher Blayre (Philip Allan, 7s. 6d.),
deal with happenings in an imaginary uni-
versity. One or two are frankly comic:
“The Man Who Killed the Jew,” for
example. The tragedy of Khartophilus—who.
according to Roger of Wendover, struck
the Saviour, telling Him to “go quicker,”
and heard the frightful sentence, “I, indeed,
will go quickly, but thou shall tarry till I
come again”—is usually treated in tragic
vein. In this version the Wandering Jew
arrives at a. British seaside resort and
consults the local doctor about a cold in
the head. Shortly afterwards there is a
stir in Heaven. Gabriel reports that Khar-
tophilus is trying to get in. Michael says
it is impossible; the Jew was expressly
forbidden to die before the Last Trump.
Raphael knows better. “What chance have
we,” he asks, “against Dr. Jones?” Others,
such as “Aalila,” are unconsciously funny.
Aalila is a lovely inhabitant of Venus who
gets in touch with Professor Markwand by
beam telegraphy. The lady has learned
Morse by watching R.N, ships signalling to
one another during the world war! She
and Markwand begin a liaison—the
aethereal Aalila is able to visit him by
way of his beam while her physical body
remains on guard .at her observatory in
Venus. Unfortunately, she has a jealous
husband, one Illuha. Comes a stage when
the narrator, who is Markwand’s friend,
decides to have it out with his infatuated
colleague.
‘Us the replica-Aalila of sufficient substance to
suffer physical hurt?”
“Oh yes. There is little doubt about that.”
‘ Take another postulate. Supposing some un-
authorised person” (we seldom mentioned lilutia bv
name Trom motives of delicacy), “were *to get at the
apparatus in her replica-absence. What then?”
What he fears happens. There is “;t sort
of seismic cataclysm” in the terrestial obser-
vatory. The lovers are annihilated. The
reader gets a mental picture of the wronged
husband grinning complacently at the other
end of the beam route. But most of the
papers deposited by the professors are a
good deal more impressive than that. “The
Demon” is a description of a woman in the
throes of the trouble that is understood to
have afflicted the Gadarene swine. Cyn-
thia, the dainty, the flower-like, undergoes
a sinister change.
It was the same willowy figure, the brown eyes
the fine long hands and feet —but her hair! In
place of her red-gold aureole was a short ' thick
crop of black curly stubble. The expression' in hoi-
eves was that of an animal gathering itself to
spring.
During one of her attacks a terrified G.P.
sends for her friend the Regius Professor.
I he old tender half-humorous eyes were open, and
as Auboyne leaned over her she said softly: “It
was good of you to come, George I’ve been in
Hell.”
But as she spoke the Demon flashed into her
eyes again, and she sprang to a sitting position
with a wild cry—like an animal in pain. The
Regius Professor put his arm round her, and she
clawed his face. But only for a moment. Then
she sank in his arms, and he laid her gently back
upon the bed.
That was all.
'The Book” i s another good thriller. As
in the case of nearly all horror-stories, the
most effective are the least pretentious.

them. There is no plot. The kindly old
storekeeper forms a link in the lives of the
families whose common virtue of neighbor-
liness is a consistently bright note. These
selectors are true to type. They risk their
own crops to “take off” the dying Ken-
worth s wheat- with a matter-of-fact
thoroughness. There is no time for senti-
ment. They are tolerant, too, to a fault—
else the malicious parasite would not have
stayed long enough to fire a crop and para-
lyse its owner. Such romance as they in-
dulge in is characteristic. There’s a gawky,
frustrated affair between a married farmer
and a sliop-“tart”; and a natural drifting
together of two young folk ready to face
the future in spite of its blackness.
I’d like to glow over this book, but can’t.

ably affectionate foreword.
E. V. BARTON.
A Poet Remembers
Some little time ago the editor of
Country Life” (London) sent me a book
to review. It was “Horns and Hooves,” by
Henry G. Lamond. The author’s name was
unknown to me, but the title looked
promising. A bit of my dear old bush,
probably ! I was not disappointed.
I began to read and I read steadily
through to the end. Here at last was the
oid life of the back country written down
bv one who knew it from A to Z. I have
read many books which have brought back
to me memories of the sheep and cattle
stations, but never one so direct and vivid,
so full of the dust of the stockyards, the
glare of the sun, the crack of whips, the
lowing and the bleating and the whinny
of the real bush.
I do not know the author; I have no
ulterior motive in praising his book; but
I know that in him Australia has an extra-
vivid writer who, without literary
trills or graces, can convey to his readers
the thrill of western life. He writes of
horses with the knowledge and sympathy of
a man who has spent his life among them,
who has ridden good racehorses, hunted
brumbies, ridden camp-horses at their work,
wrestled with foals at branding-time and
(ought and conquered Queensland buckers.
He writes equally well of cattle and sheep,
and his description of cattle on the road
and of lambs breaking from the yard-wings
at lamb-marking time are the best I have
ever read. To those who have never
taken part in the incidents which he de-
scribes these pictures must be as plain
as they are arresting; to those who have
lived the life he brings it all back in
glowing colors.
Lamond, whoever he is, is an artist. I
have no doubt that the face of the bush has
changed much in the last quarter of a cen-
tury. When I knew it, thirty years ago,
motor-cars and motor-bicycles were un-
known on the black-soil plains. Telephones
were few and far between, and no aero-
plane threw a shadow on the sandhills.
T outh nowadays seems more concerned
with mechanical invention and upkeep than
with stockwhip, saddle and spur, and doubt-
less the old tough breed of bushman is
dying out. The more reason that the old
life should be written up by a faithful
recorder. And we have it here; the scents,
the sounds, the whole spirit of it.
I commend this volume to all good Aus-
tralians, be they townsmen or bush-
whackers, but most of all to those old-
timers whom perhaps fate has compelled
to leave the scenes of their youthful adven-
ture. To these Lamond speaks in the vivid
picturesque language of the bushman.
If this book does not have a great sale
in Australia I shall be much surprised.
WILL H. OGILVIE.
England v. Whatwouldyou?
The crowd was so thick that on the way
through I trod on a woman, but. apart
from calling me a flat-footed basket or
something of the sort, she took it veiy well.
The pressure of 5000 or so of the 70,000
catapulted me through the gate on to the
playing field, and then the crowd cheered
me, perhaps mistaking me for Dally Mes-
senger or the Governor.
On the field I stretched out on the turf,
about six yards from the sideline. The
turf was as freshly green as ever I had
seen it, even in spring, and the sunshine,
slanting down over (he high grandstands,
was warm wattle-gold. All round, outside
the white circle of pickets, waited the crowd
—a dull grey mass with only here and there
a splash of woman to brighten it.
There was a desultory sort of football
match going on—one of the reserve grades,
and very poor. If the crowd had any inter-
est in the game it made no show of it.
I am sure it had none; these curtain-
raisers are like introductions to books—
nobody ever takes them seriously. Instead,
the crowd on the Hill was having outbreaks
of heaving things at each other—nothing
serious; outbursts of good spirits.
It stopped with the stopping of the
match, and these players straggled off. Pre-
sently, after a hush, the crowd voiced a
seemingly unanimous roar. I saw the Aus-
tralian XIII trotting out on to the field
in line. They wore dark shorts and green
jerseys with a gold Vat the throat—a good
local color, like the turf and their own sun-
gold that they trotted over. The band
struck up “Australia’s Sons” which, like all
anthems, is an abomination somehow
magicked into an inspiration. I should
think that everybody who heard it felt there
and then that it was good to be Australian
—not consciously, but wholly unconsciously,
the only way that matters much in life or
writing. I should think, too, that it is not
often we feel this so purely, so fully or
so generally as it was felt there.
The crowd roared. It sent up a great
shout. Then came the Englishmen—all
white, with red-white-and-blue V at the
j ersey throat. There was another roar,
apparently as unanimous as the first. If
you had never been to a football Test
before you would have said that here was
an unbiased crowd, out to see the best side
win—or perhaps you would have thought
that only if you hacl been one of those
mental deficients who believe that war —
conflict—can be written or contracted out
of a humanity that is at its best a veneer
over passion and savagery.
The game started; and immediately such
veneer as this crowd wore was thrown off.
It was undisguisedly out’ for one thing—
to see Australia win. Its shout became all
savageness and passion. It cheered, but it
jeered, too. I do not include its laughing-
barracking of the Englishman Sullivan
during his kicks for goal: Sullivan is a
superb goal-kick—l have never’ seen his
equal—but his tittering dance before he
starts his run is a comic spectacle. If the
Australian crowd did not laugh at him it
would not, prove the crowd Sporting; it
would simply prove deficiency of a sense of
humor, and that, notwithstanding our
writers to the contrary, is not our great
negative.
I am assuming here that we are Aus-
tralians—that you can say “Australians” and
mean something. At any rate, the passion
of this crowd made me feel that “Aus-
tralian” is not, meaningless; that we are
becoming something that a writer will one
day synthesise for us, (This has still to
be done, even with our bush, which is not
all gum-trees and brown patches, but very
green and gold in many places.) Good-
ness knows when we will reach such a
cohesive state that that writer will natu-
rally evolve and do his job—something at
that football Test made me think it may
not be yet awhile. It w T as this. There, a
few yards from the line, I could hear much
of the talk of the players (Many might
not know that footballers during play talk
almost as incessantly as wrestlers do.)
I noticed that when England losl the ball
in the scrum there was a chorus of “Lost,
England! Lost, England!”—at once a
warning and a spur. Similarly you could
hear “England! England!” ejaculated as
a battle cry in other rallies, and very stir-
ring, too.
I did not hear Australia mentioned once.
I can’t imagine it stirring our fellows to
action if it had been. “O to be in Eng-
land” will do grandly, but “O to be in
Australia” is dishwater. All our chaps could
raise in the way of a cohesive cry was
“Green!”—not themselves, but the mere
color of their jerseys, donned for the hour,
and to be stripped off afterwards. There
can be growth in a color; there is growth
in green, but it is Irish growth, and we have
no right to it. Nor could the crowd get its
teeth into anything clear that it could call
its side. You knew only by its tone—the
unconscious in control—how its feelings
ran. It did not collectively call its side
anything. It was England v. Whatwould-
you?
Yet, for all this, I have never seen any
more naked evidence. that we are growing
into a people. We have no literature just
for that reason—that we have not yet
grown. But we are shaping.
CECIL MANN.
A Satchel of Books
Miles Burton is mot .at his best in Murder
at the Moorings (Collins; 7s. 6d.). It
peters out towards the end ; with an improb-
able confession of a highly improbable
murder. Its best features are the pictures
of village pub life in England, which the
reader is shown while the police are making
their investigations, and the police are as
English as the hostelry in which the heroine
is employed.
The Bondwomen (Heinemann; 7s. 6d.),
which is another of W. G. Collingwood’s
novels about the Norse settlers in Westmor-
land, has been out of print for many years.
It is a sequel to his “Thorstin of the Mere,”
which was reviewed on this Page last year,
and it is in some respects a more interest-
ing romance. Christianity is beginning to
master paganism, and, though the feelings
of the rough inhabitants may not have been
so fine, nor their talk so sophisticated, it all
adds to the glamor of what is essentially a
love story.
Mr. Philip Garland, the popular grazier,
was under suspicion of sheep-stealing;
Messrs. Milner and Hart were in pursuit and
he was shooting to kill. Ear more blame-
worthy than Mr. Garland was Mr. Larsen
—a pastbralist who would be: denied admis-
sion to any decent picnic race club in the"
Commonwealth despite his indisputable
knowledge of horses. On meeting Mr. Gar-
land —just casually, as it might he in Men-
zies or the Australia- —Mr. Larsen’s features
“altered into, a look of savage fury like a
cougar about to spring, and his hand swept
down to his gun-grip.” What could Mr. G.
do but reach for his weapon?
Suddenly lie found Alice in his arms.
“You did it! You did it!” she gasped through
happy tears. “You‘beat: him on the draw!”
Alice, a healthy, clean-minded country girl,
is used to corpses, and doesn’t let that of
Mr. Larsen cramp her emotional style. So
all ends happily. Such, briefly is the plot of
The Fight for River Range . by Frank C.
Robertson (Collins; 7s. 6d.). The venue
is the IJ.S.A. wild west. We handle these
prbbleins somewhat differently as regards
details in Australia, but the broad general
idea is the same.

CHANCES OF NEW STATES.
To begin with, the overgrowth of our hand-
ful of capital cities was a natural process.
The young colonies had few of those things
which civilised society wants, and what
they did acquire they set up in the depots
which the first settlers had made. The
very existence there of comforts and con-
veniences, not to be had elsewhere, attracted
and held population which otherwise would
have flowed out into the country; and with
the growth of the habit of coming or send-
ing to these depots for pretty well every-
thing, the cities became overwhelming and
the struggle of the country township grew
more desperate. Governments meantime had
settled down in the depots, and soon their
influence was enormous. Railways were
planned to converge on the great central
wens, and freights were fixed in their interests.
As the population of the cities grew their
politics became less and less concerned with
the country. Manufactures now and again
made a struggle to establish themselves in
rural towns; but nearly always the
freights were fatal. As the industrialists
gained political and other power, their
organisations made life more difficult in
the country. Although the wool and the
wheat that were‘selling in Sydney for 20s.
in 1929 were worth only 10s. 9d. and 12s.
lid. respectively in May of this year, non-
rural products worth 20s. in 1929 were still
worth 19s. (xl. in May, 1932. If there was
not enough to go around in a depression
the political and other leaders of the city
industrialists had no compunction what-
ever in throwing the whole burden of suf-
fering upon the rural industries.
That N. S. Wales country districts would
rise in angry protest against all this was
inevitable: all that was needed was some
little extra squeeze at a time of great strain,
and the appearance of a leader. John Thomas
Lang provided the little extra squeeze; the
leader turned up in the dynamic Charles
Hardy. Before long there were Country
Movements everywhere, all denouncing city
government and crying for new States.
Those who expected that the results of
pending Federal and State elections would
bring forgetfulness of past wrongs were dis-
appointed. The cry was as lusty almost as
ever; and a conference of representatives
of the various movements —Northern,
Western, Riverina and South Coast—held
in Sydney this month proceeded to carve
up the territory. There was one purpose
common to them all: none of them wanted
to have S>*dney on their hands.
Unfortunately the way out is not so easy
as it might have been once. The Common-
wealth is in the path. A Federal Constitu-
tion is a bargain between its members. It
is true that it is not necessary that every
State shall agree to a proposed alteration,
but it must be agreed to by an absolute
majority of each House of the Federal Par-
liament, and within six months the pro-
posed alteration must go to the electors:
And if in a majority of the States a majority of
the electors voting approve the proposed law, and
if a majority of all the electors voting also approve
the proposed law, it shall be presented... .for assent.
That makes any alteration of the Consti-
tution difficult. Only two out of 15 referen-
dums have been carried.
It may be, however, that no alteration
of the Constitution would be called for in
this case. There are, of course, provisions
for the admission of new States. Thus Sec-
tion 124:—■
A new State may be formed by separation of
territory from a State, but only with the consent
of the Parliament thereof.
It thus seems doubtful whether it would
be possible for a State to be divided into
three parts, as the conference has suggested.
The most that could be done might be to
cut off a part with the consent of the Par-
liament of the State. If the Parliament
consented and a new State was established,
it might then be necessary for the Parlia-
ment of the dismembered State to agree
to the separation of more territory. Or a
State might be formed by the separation of
the entire area seeking separation, and it
might subsequently divide itself into two
as the Constitution provides.
The sections dealing with New States are
such a patchwork that other necessary pre-
liminaries to separation and the establish-
ment of a new State are in grave doubt.
Section 124 says that a new State may be
formed by separation, “but only with the
consent of the Parliament” of the State.
Section 123 says that the Parliament of
the Commonwealth may “increase, dimin-
ish or otherwise alter the limits” of a
State, but only “with the consent of the
Parliament” of the State, “and the approval
of the majority of the electors of the State
voting upon the question.” In view, further-
more, of the fact that Section 128 la3 r s
it down that an>- Constitutional amend-
ment “increasing, diminishing or otherwise
altering the limits” of a State must be en-
dorsed by “the majority of the electors
voting” on the question, it is fairly clear
that separation and establishment of a new
State must be endorsed by the people of
the State as well as by Parliament; for a
separation is the same separation no matter
how it is made.
It can be assumed, therefore, that (1)
only one State can be established at a
time, and (2) it must get the sanction both
of the Parliament of the State and of the
people. This involves a settlement of the
question of debts to be taken over; and
this may be embodied in the terms and con-
ditions on which the new State is admitted.
Under the Constitution the six original
States have six Senators each and a mini-
mum of five Representatives. A new State
has whatever representation is allowed bv
the Federal Parliament, which is completely
free in the matter. What representation the
Parliament would be likely to allow can
only be guessed at. The original State of
N. S. Wales would retain its six Senators;
would the smaller States still look upon the
new States as part of N. S. Wales and vote
against giving them any substantial num-
ber of Senators, or permit the five-minimum
to apply to their representation in the other
House? Or would they welcome these new
States as anti-industrial and therefore
brothers? A strong case could be made
out for the latter view.
And for this reason it is not at all certain
that a vote in favor of separation could be
won from the people of N. S. Wales. The
inevitable result of the establishment of
new States would be the strengthening, in
some degree, of the anti-Labor force in the
Senate; and that consideration might weigh
against the certainty that separation of
these new States would increase the Labor
hold on the N. S. Wales Parliament. But
however Labor might vote on the question,
it is sure that, though the other politi-
cal section may have the greatest sympathy
with the aspirations of the separationists,
it will record an almost solid vote against
separation until the Federal powers have
been greatly extended. At present the
country electorates are the chief buffers
against the capture of power in Sydney by
the Reds; and they will be clung to despe-
rately until Sydney can secure some degree
of protection from an enlargement of the
Federal powers.
All this, of course, assumes that the dis-
affected country districts will proceed eon-
stitutionally. They might break away and
set up Governments of their own, and under
certain extreme circumstances it is possible
that they might gain admission to the Com-
monwealth. But such a thing would be
quite out of the question so long as the
Government of the State was obeying the
laws of the Commonwealth and co-operat-
ing with it.
The mapping out of the boundaries of
the proposed new States max* be a neces-
sary preliminary; but it ought to be fol-
lowed closely by a serious consideration of
how it is proposed to meet the difficulties
that crowd the path to their establishment.
SECOND CHAMBERS.
When first the attack was made on Aus-
tralian Second Chambers in the early ’nine-
ties, the popular idea was that they were
either undemocratic or redundant: undemo-
cratic if they disagreed with the other
Chamber and redundant if they agreed
with it. But that entirely overlooked a
matter of some importance: it assumed
that the first Chamber must necessarily be
democratic, and there is no warrant any-
where for the assumption. On the con-
trary it is quite certain that large and
active forces are continually at work to
make this Chamber unrepresentative—by
gerrymandering the electorates; by stuffing
the rolls; by shifting large bodies of
electors from one district to another on
the eve of an election, and employing them
on public works; by making false state-
ments to mislead electors; b3 r buying votes
with jobs and promises of jobs. If the
popular Chamber truly and completely
expressed the considered judgment of the
people, there would, it is admitted, be no
justification whatever for a Second
Chamber. It is simply because there is an
unceasing struggle to outwit the people
that safeguards are called for.
And it is not possible by any one elec-
tion. no matter how honestly it may be
conducted, to get the opinion of the people
on every question and every detail of every
question. Thus at the N. S. Wales general
election the other day Mr. Stevens declared
that it was part of his programme to put
up the rate of exchange. It would be
absurd, however, to suppose that, because
men who disapprove of political interfer-
ence with the currency voted for him and
not for Mr. Lang, they endorsed Mr.
Stevens’s views.
When a shipment of ore comes into a
smelting works for sale samples arc taken
a.t many points, and after being crushed and
divided and subdivided, with the residue
remixed after every division, a shovelful is
left for assaj r . But the sampling is repeated;
there is another crushing, and new divi-
sions and subdivisions, until finally another
shovelful is left for a check assay. Results
repeatedly show how necessary a check is
even where the first sampling has been
faithfully done; it is more than ever neces-
sary where there has been the possibility
of trickery and malpractice.
Various methods of auditing the people’s
deputies and their proposed measures have
been devised. The referendum, initiative
and recall have been suggested as the most
direct means; and many experiments have
been made with Second Chambers—in a
few cases, even three. As to these chambers
four methods of creation are available,
along with combinations of two or more:
(1) nomination, the method X. S'. Wales
copied from Britain, with modifications;
(2) election by the people, with or without
limited franchise, and in large electoral
districts, the system used in Victoria, S.
Australia and elsewhere; (3) election by
local authorities, as in France; (4) election
by the popular Chamber.
The most modern of Second Chambers,
over whose creation the greatest amount
of research and eloquence was expended,
is the Senate of the Irish Free State. The
founders tried to make it a combination of
all the virtues. The nominee system has
its good points: in theory it gives the
nation the benefit of the services of men
who would never—could never—face a
popular election. The fathers of the Free
State therefore made a compromise between
nomination and election b3* the people:
they provided that, after the first Parlia-
ment had been set up, the Senate should
consist of 60 men, elected for 12 3-ears, one-
fourth retiring every three years, nomina-
tions to be confined to ex-Senators and 45
men, the latter chosen 30 by the Chamber
of Deputies (the “lower House”) and 15
b3‘ the Senate itself, the actual election to
be by the people of the State voting as
one electorate, and the election to be by
proportional representation. The 45 people
nominated were to be just the sort of people
Senators ought to be, and as they arc
alwa3-s supposed to be wherever they are
nominated—and as experience shows they
rarely are. Still, the sy§|em has its merits,
and that the Chamber itself has not been
more effective is due to its severely re-
stricted powers.
Alongside the Free State’s Senate an-
other was created for the North. But here
the applicable conclusions of the majority
of Lord Bryce’s Conference on the Reform
of the House of Lords were accepted
almost without argument, That confer-
ence had proposed a chamber consisting
of a gradually lessening number of peers
(diminishing to 30), with a main body
elected b\ r the members of the Hous6 of
Commons, using proportional representa-
tion. and divided for electoral purposes into
13 districts; membership to be for 12 3'ears,
one-third retiring every four years. Expense
has never been seriouslv- put forward as an
argument against the popular election of
a Second Chamber: always the objection
has been that if two bodies came from the
same electorate one would not give way
to the other. The answer to that is that
if they do not come froih the people, they
have no right to stand in the way at all.
District or Counts* Court Judges do not
insist upon having their way against the
Supreme Court though they derive their
authority from the same people. The autho-
rity is different, and that settles it.
One other system of fcheck has com-
manded much attention—the Norwegian.
Here there is but one election; but when
the new House meets, as its first business it
divides itself into two; and the dominant
party has a majority in both sections. There
is thus a check upon detail rather than
upon policy; and there seems to be no-
thing in the plan which Australia might
copy with advantage.
The Chamber for which N. S. Wales is
waiting ought to be elective, and to inake
the check effective members ought to be
chosen b3* large districts, with proportional
representation (one purpose of Second
Chambers being the protection of minori-
ties) ; membership ought to be for a term
of, sav, six years, with one-half retiring
every third year; and elections ought not
to be held at the same time as those for
the other Chamber. A minor problem is
presented by the existing Leg. Council. A
compromise here is possible by an adapta-
tion of the Irish Free State plan: nomina-
tions for the half of the Chamber which is
to retire in three years might be restricted
to members of the present Council with a
membership of, say, three years and up-
wards—it would be absurd that gentlemen
who were lately appointed for the express
purpose of wholly destroying, the Second
Chamber should be eligible for nomination
as candidates for such a body.
MORE REFLECTIONS OF LIM.
[General Lini Kee was a Chinese soldier who
retired to a monastery; from this retreat he has
communicated his reflections, which show how the
cultured Oriental views world-movements.]
“I note from the papers,” my friend General
Lint writes, “that the spiritual leaders of
the West are exhorting you to return to
Christ as a cure for the depression. When one
dwells on top of a hill in a Chinese monas-
tery overlooking such a lovely vista of forest
and mountain, one may perhaps be able to
view the great mass-movements of mankind
with more than ordinary detachment. To
what Christ, I ask. do your bishops want
3 r ou to return? There are so many of
them. There is the Christ Who said that
we are all children of the one Father, a
beautiful truth that is periodically remem-
bered when your League of Nations meets
and tries to beat its sword-blades into battle-
ships with a tonnage limitation, but will be
as readily forgotten when your delegates
meet at the Ottawa Economic Conference
to wrangle over preferences. There is the
Christ Who said, with Lao-Tze, that the
Kingdom of Heaven is within us, and there
is the Christ of St. Paul and of the Gospels.
For some of these Christs I look in vain
to-day for disciples anywhere. There is the
Christ of the Portuguese and Spanish world-
conquerors who destroyed the civilisations
of Mexico and Peru, burned Indians, im-
paled Javanese and attempted to upset
the ancient, order of China. There is the
Christ of the modern Imperialist; there is
the Christ of the industrial era; there is
the nationalist Christ, and there is the
internationalist Christ.
“Then thei’e is the lay Christ of Com-
munism. We must not be deceived about
this Christ. Ho is the champion of the
submerged multitudes of every country.
He holds out a new hope to the proletariat.
He has His fanatical disciples who thank
Him for the privilege of martyrdom while
the police batons rain down upon their
heads. To the oppressed .and despairing,
the people for whom life is a burden too
heavy to be borne, He preaches resentment.
They stir and turn towards Him in every
land and give His prophets different names
—Marx, Lenin, Sun Yat Sen and Gandhi.
They turn, not towards Jerusalem, but
towards Moscow, where Lenin’s coffin, like
Mahomet’s, is suspended in mid-air, while
the body in it remains miraculously pre-
served from decay, a token of Heaven’s
approval; or towards a village outside.
Canton, where the black-haired, bullet-
headed Messiah of modern Asia was born.
“These Messiahs, like the Christ of the
Gospels, have a Heaven to offer the humble
and oppressed. But it is a Heaven of this
world. It fits into the picture of an indus-
trialised world. It is a Heaven loud with the
clang of steel hammers, the hissing of
steam, the blowing of factory whistles.. It
burps stinking incense to a god called mass-
production. It is the Heaven of economic
security, of the safe job, of three meals
a day, of six hours’ work, or less, a day.
It is the Heaven of continuous employ-
ment from the cradle to the grave; for
unemployment is the modern Hell and eco-
nomic insecurity is its Devil.
“To this Heaven not only the proletari-
ans and their leaders look. It is the
Heaven of J. P. Morgan and Co., the Prince
of Wales, Ramsay MacDonald, President
Hoover and Mussolini, as well as of Stalin,
Chiang-Kai-shek and the Mikado, and we
need not be surprised if a capitalistic Con-
stantine arises with the genius to use the
unifying force of the new faith to save
the capitalist society, with its witless,, aim-
less leaders, from disintegrating altogether.
“It is the duty of gods to become like
the people who worship them, and their
capacity to change is unlimited. The Greek-
gods, beautiful, serene, philosophical and
tolerant, became grotesque, passionate,
malignant and fanatical when the slaves in
the Greek world began to outnumber and
overpower their masters. The Roman gods
were equally adaptable.
“How changed the Christian God of 100
years ago is from the Christian God of to-
day may be illustrated by this quotation
from a speech of the once-eminent but
mediocre English poetess Hannah More,
delivered in 1801 to a gathering of poor
women who were in sore straits as the
result of a famine:—
The famine has also enabled you to see more
clearly the advantages you derive from the Govern-
ment and constitution of this country—to observe
the benefits flowing from the distinction of rank and
fortune, which has enabled the high so liberally to
assist the low; for I leave you to judge what would
have been the state of the poor cf this country in
this long, distressing scarcity had it not been for
your superiors. I wish you to understand, also, that
you are not the only sufferers. You have, indeed,
borne your share, and a very heavy one it has! been,
in the late difficulties; but it has fallen in some
degree on all ranks, nor would the gentry have been
able to afford such large supplies to the distresses
of the poor had they not denied themselves, for your
sakes, many indulgences to which their fortune at
other times entitles them. We trust the poor in
general, especially those that are well-instructed,
have received what has been ejone for them as a
matter of favor, not of right—if so, the same
kindness will, I doubt not, always be extended to
them, whenever it shall please God so to afflict
the land.
“Imagine a democratic statesman saying
anything like that to-day! He would be
tom to pieces by the mob, or at least lose
his election deposit.”

Ottawa.
The object qf the Ottawa Conference,
stated bluntly, is to encourage trade be-
tween the various parts of the Empire; and
to that end it is suggested that the over-
seas dominions will be asked to give a
warmer welcome to British manufactures in
exchange for a wanner British welcome to
overseas raw products. Any mention of
Ottawa therefore makes the overseas pro-
tectionist prick his ears; and before the
conference assembled, delegates from S..
Africa and elsewhere felt called upon to
make it quite clear that Ottawa was no
altar to which they came to sacrifice their
nationalism.
Nevertheless, even if that position is
stoutly held, there is much that the con-
ference may do. Trade figures for the last
three years are so exceptional that they
may be put aside. But going back to
1928-29 it will be found that Australia’s
imports for the year amounted to 144 mil-
lions, of which 57 millions only were British.
Those figures are bad enough in them-
selves; they are worse when compared with
previous records. In 1913, the last full pre-
war year, 59.7 p.c. of all our imports were
British, and in 1921-22 they were still 51.4
p.c. But from that point year by year
there had been a steady fall until 1928-29
showed just under 39 p.c. of British goods.
It has to be remembered, too, that these
were years of heavy borrowing from Britain,
and we got none of our borrowings in
money—we either got them in goods or
paid overseas interest with them. A large
part we took in goods; but we bought them
with John Bull’s money from John Bull’s
trade competitors.
So within 16 years we turned 20 p.c.
of, our import trade away from Britain to
foreign nations. What we did with it and
what we got in return this table shows
for 1928-29:
Exports from Imports to
Australia. Australia.
United Kingdom .. . . £55,172,552 £67,028,238
France .. .. ..- 15,141,156 3,700,303

United States .. .. 5,831,794 35,308,345
Other countries .. . . 47,455,576 38,358,195
Ottawa has something to answer there:
how comes it that Britain has lost so
much of its trade and the United States
have captured it, though they bought so
little from us in return?
The British Department of Overseas
Trade divides Australian imports so far
as the U.K. is concerned into competitive
and non-competitive, the latter being goods,
like timber and oils, which Britain cannot
supply. For 1928-29 these non-competitive
lines were 37 millions out of the total of
143 millions, leaving 106 millions for which
Britain was a competitor; and it got only
56 millions, or 53 p.c. of the possible. Aus-
tralia would rather buy the other 47 p.c.
from Britain than from anybody else. If
Mr. Bruce can tell Mr. Thomas why it
hasn’t done so, and if Mr. Thomas can
overcome the difficulty, if there is a diffi-
culty, Ottawa may do a groat thing for the
Empire.
There are those in Britain who at least
have a suspicion of what the trouble is.
The International Cotton Federation, with
headquarters at Manchester, reported that,
whereas in the U.S.A. there were 565,000
automatic looms to 134,000 ordinary, looms,
in Britain there were only 14,000 auto-
matics to 679,000 ordinaries—and one
weaver with one assistant can tend 60 auto-
matics whereas one weaver usually tends
only four British ordinaries. Of American
coal 73 p.c. is mined by machinery against
23 p.c. of British, with an American average
output per miner over three times greater
than the British. It is this sort of thing
which has cost Britain its export trade
not only to the dominions, but to all parts
of the world.
Australia is eager to trade with Britain.
It knows that Britain is far and away our
best customer. It realises that the figures
of the boom years were deplorable.
Britain’s own high authorities have told
the reasons why*; and the blame is not
wholly ours. Nothing is to be gained now
by asking why so many British industries
ran to seed. The thing to rejoice over is
that the fact has been recognised and the
policy changed; and if we can assist even
a little in the restoration of the Old
Country’s prosperity by undertaking to
support its revitalised industries, sending
that way orders which hitherto have gone
to much poorer customers of ours, we will
do it veiy gladly. It is in this way that Aus-
tralia can best help Britain; maybe it is
by putting new life and bringing new
methods into its industries that Britain can
best help itself.

A Coalition in South Australia.
There is talk of a National Government in
S. Australia; and the inclinations that way
should be encouraged. The position has
been incongruous for months past. Lionel
Hill, the Premier, leader of a Labor Gov-
ernment, has been excommunicated, along
with his Ministers, by the body which pro-
fesses to speak for Labor, their offence
being a too-faithful adherence to the
Premiers’ Plan. Throughout the period
when J. T. Lang was threatening Australia ■
with disaster, Hill was a strong pillar of
commonsense and honesty, and he has
shown a courage which marks him out from
the smaller men who have come to heel
when some body outside Parliament has
cracked the whip. For S. Australia to lose
his services because he has shown unex-
pectedly high quaiitites. would be a great
misfortune.
Yet the position is not easy. The largely-
hidden forces that control the Labor
party know what they are about. Every
man who shows himself not entirely ready
to obey their orders is expelled. They take
no chances of being beaten in argument. So
the Labor party moves inevitably towards
Bolshevism. The real problem is how best
to meet that movement. Take the case of
Mr. Hill. The State—and Australia—ought
to have his services. But in ordinary cir-
cumstances there is only one thing for the
Labor man to do when the ruling body
outside Parliament expels him: if he wants
to remain in politics he must go right
across to his recent opponents. Occasionally
he has had a personal success as an unen-
dorsed candidate; but it has always been
short-lived. There is no place in our party-
ridden politics for an Independent. If enough
expulsions took place at one time, the ex-
pelled might pit themselves a gainst the auto-
crats of the machine; but there never are
many at a, time. Even the comparatively
powerful group of anti-Lang Laborites in N.
S. Wales the other day could not win a single
seat. Yet the man who goes from one party
to another, and denounces to-day what he
fought for yesterday, is in. grave danger of
having his sincerity challenged. And that
is especially the case where the Laborite
has been at once given high office in the
other party. Not even in the case of Mr.
Lyons was it wise to make the convert of
to-day the Archbishop of to-morrow.
But a coalition for a specific purpose is
quite a different matter. Mr. Butler, the
Opposition-leader of S. Australia, says he
does not, in general, approve of coalitions.
In general, nobody should. Their only
justification is that, circumstances have
arisen which call for a union of forces
against a threatening danger which may be
too great for either opponent singly. Those
circumstances now exist in S.. Australia.
When they have passed, the two sections
may fall apart again if they find that, after
all, their supposed differences of political
opinion were not largely a myth. That,
anyhow, will be far better than throwing
Mr. Hill and his colleagues on the scrap-
heap for their merits; far better even than
offering them the alternative of changing
their political coats to save their lives.

Bad Staff Work.
The organisers of last week’s Anzac
Memorial ceremony in Sydney gave an
example of how not to do such things.
The Lord Mayor, who was chairman, did
not serve in the war, and neither did the
Premier, who laid one of the foundation-
stones. The Governor, who laid the other
stone, never saw Anzac. A religious note
was introduced by Dean Talbot, but none
of the padres whose names resounded,
throughout Australia 17 ago—men of
the type of the Presbyterian McPhee of
the 3rd Brigade, Green (Methodist)
of the 2nd Brigade, McAuliffe (R.C.) of
the Ist Brigade and the Salvation Army’s
McKenzie (“Fighting Mac.”) —were to the
fore. The few fighting Diggers of renown
who had seats on the official platform were
much less conspicuous than non-soldier
public men, who—Mr. Lang excepted—
clapped loudly when Mr. Stevens men-
tioned that “this present struggle calls
again for the same qualities of devotion to
the interests of the country which were
evinced by all creeds and classes during
the World War.”
It was tactless to give the ceremony a
Christian flavor; Jews played glorious parts
on Anzac. and in France and Palestine.
Tactless to give it a denominational flavor;
Australia has no State church, and no one
Christian denomination did better as re-
gards enlistment figures or valor in the
field than another. Above all, it was tact-
less to select two Englishmen and two non-
combatants for the leading parts in a cere-
mony designed to commemorate fallen
members of the A.I.F. It is another indica-
tion of how this country is being American-
ised. Such bloomers are thought nothing
of in the U.S.A. In Britain and on the
Continent they display a much finer sense
of what is fitting.

The Case for the Canegrower.
Dear Bulletin, — In B. 20/7/’32 you state
the case for the sugar industry very fairly,
and we are grateful; but you say Australia
is paying for the sugar it consumes “about
double the average European price.” The
retail price in Australia is 4.5 d. per pound.
In the five leading European countries the
retail price averages 4.3 d. per pound ster-
ling. It is true that in Britain the price
is only 24d. per pound, but the British tax-
payer subsidises the beet-sugar industry to
the tune of £10,000,000 a year, which
accounts, in part, for the disparity. The
Australian sugargrower gets no bonus or
subsidy at all. Again, when the agreement
was first made, and the price fixed at
£3O 6s. Bd. a ton for raw sugar, there was
no surplus for export. When the price was
reduced to £25 a tou it was expressly agreed
that the growers should stand the loss that
they might make through having to export
their surplus; and they are standing it.—
Yours etc., F. C. Curlewis, Australian
Sugar Producers’ Association; W. 11.

The Whole-time Politician.
It was announced a few days ago that the
Assistant-Treasurer of N. S. Wales—one
of the new members of the Assembly—
had retired from the firm of accountants
of which he was a member; and the public
was as good as asked to hand him three
cheers for getting out of a very well-known
and profitable business and giving his whole
time to the affairs of the country. The
Bulletin declines the invitation; it refuses
to give any cheers at all. Instead, it says
that the plan which has been followed in
this case is a thoroughly bad one.
The whole-time politician is one of the
millstones round the neck of this sorely-
afflicted country. Having no job apart
from politics, in nine cases out of ten he
depends for his living on getting votes. He
becomes an obedient party hack in Parlia-
ment and a faithful servant of the machine
which controls the party nominations and
the party funds. In his electorate his best
attention is given to that section of whose
support he is least sure; and, if he is not
a Labor man, this means, as a rule, that
he gives away as much to Labor as he
dares—-which explains why Labor some-
times thinks it gets more out of its oppo-
nents than out of its own party. The samp
perpetual hunt for votes makes this type
of politician an active agent in overloading
an already overloaded public service, and
in pushing on public works whose only
merit is that they will give somebody a
job and probably add a bit to the value
of somebody’s property. Nobody knows
how many of the public servants of Aus-
tralia owe their jobs to the vote-hunter,
or how much of the unprofitable railways
and other works is due to the same cala-
mity; but, without a doubt, there are thou-
sands of the one, and millions have been
sunk in the other.
But it is when the full-time politician
gets into a Ministry that he is seen at his
best. Having to placate a hungry horde,
the little group which clusters around the
Premier when he is choosing a. team is
driven to include twice as many as there
honestly is need for. But the man who knows
what he is there for soon gets over that
difficulty. He proceeds to devote special
attention to, say, prawns; and soon a
private secretary (who is just, as anxious
to find something to do as the Minister
is), pours into the ears of the roundsmen
stories of the vast national importance of
prawns. Within six months, if the two
know their job, a special department has
been set up to promote the great prawning
industry. And the chances are that in the
next Government there will be a Minister
for Prawns and (say) Stock Routes. It is
not only that full-time politicians thus
make jobs for themselves and one another;
they make at the same time ridiculous jobs
for 20 times as many superfluous clerks.
The Minister for Prawns—any Minister—
will plead that he spends more time in
his office than the most hard-working of
his clerks. He probably does. And it
would be far better if he didn’t. Instead
of building up public services controlled by
experts who know no party, we have sub-
stituted control by politicians who turn
the business of administration into one
long electioneering campaign.

Making Work.
It would be interesting to know how many
people a given number of primary pro-
ducers can maintain. At Broken Hill the
other day evidence was given by the secre-
tary of the Mining Managers’ Association
regarding the population of the town and
the number of men employed on the mines
at various dates. With 7267 men on the
mines there was a population of 31,350;
with 7219 employed, 31,600; with 6253 em-
ployed, 31,750. That gives approximately
five people to one workman. But the ore
mined keeps the great smelting works at
Port Pirie going; these call for coal and
coke from Newcastle and shipping between
ports; the zinc concentrates keep the zinc
works at Risdon (Tas.) employed. Broken
Hill and Pirie and Risdon grow no food,
and probably these three groups maintain
a further population of 20,000 food-raisers.
By this time we have a pyramid of pro-
bably 80,000 people based on Broken Hill.
And that is little more than the beginning.
All these people want clothes and hats and
boots and homes to live in and gramo-
phones; and the men who want to sell the
boots and gramophones call for string and
wrapping-paper; and—there is no end to
the operations which the hauling of a truck
of ore out of a Broken Hill mine sets going.
But how is it all paid for? This truck
of ore, which puts a hundred men at work,
is not worth more than a couple of pounds;
and alongside that the miracle of the loaves
and fishes seems hardly a miracle at all.
The explanation lies in the fact that every-
body who comes into the procession adds
value to what he touches; and as long as
he does that the movement can go on in-
terminably. The crude ore is fed into the
mill, which gets rid of the bulk of the
dross and makes a partial separation of the
metals; it goes on to the smelters or the
zinc works, where the process of separation
is completed; the products go on to the
metal-workers. All these call for food,
which is supplied by the men who have
taken grain and multiplied it; and they
with the others call for clothing—and here
We have the entire process repeated.
But suppose we put a hundred men at
work filling up a hole to make a sports
ground. They eat just as much, ft fs true,
and require just as much clothing and hous-
ing. But there is this great' difference:
what the miners produce is not only in
itself saleable, but is something which
will go on “giving work”—the ore goes
to the mill, and the mill product goes
to the smelters and the metals go to
the metal-workers. On the other hand the
men who are put on to shift sand do their
job and out of it flows no stream of further
operations. There is no fruit from their
labor; they have to be paid out of some-
body else’s fruit. These other people ought
to be getting the value they add to what-
ever they touch; that is their rightful hat-
vest. But if they have to share their har-
vest with too great a number of non-pro-
ducers —the men whose work is giving no
return —then obviously they are in great
danger of running short themselves. That
is what is the matter with most Australian
industries, and especially primary indus-
tries, to-day. Too many non-producers
demand a share of their product, or too
many producers demand more than the
value they have added to the product.
Again and again' The Bulletin: has de-
clared that the re-employment of our
people is not so great a problem as it is
made out to be. ,We have seen what can
be done with the production of a truck of
ore. So long as everybody adds value to
the product he touches, the procession can
go on indefinitely. It would be easier for
the 300,000 unemployed in Australia to-day
to keep themselves than it is for the mil-
lion or so who are at work to keep them-
selves and the other 300,000. The more we
add to the 300,000 the more difficult will
it be, too, for the million to keep going.
If we can get men producing things and
adding to the value of things produced,
we shall be on the way out of our troubles.
We shall never get out of them by tinker-
ing with non-productive jobs; socially they
may be better than the dole, but economi-
cally they are not. Indeed, they may be
economically worse, because they involve
the waste of plant and material as well
as money. •

First Chambers Need Reforming, Too.
N* S. Wales is on the point of considering
the reform of its Second Chamber; but it
is open to question whether it is not just
as important to reform its First Chamber.
We live under what we are told is a demo-
cratic form of government, and it is taken
for granted that everybody should have one
vote and only one vote. But nobody has
ever had the privilege of imposing upon
us any law which is unalterable; nor has
anybody ever had the privilege of saying
that such-and-such shall be the form ol
government 6, 10 or 20 years hence If.
therefore, we find that the system which
another generation chose for itself is not
a success, we ha,ve an inalienable right to
alter it. Suppose, for example, a man
shows that he has not a proper regard for
the law by repeatedly breaking it, surely it
cannot be safely assumed that he will have
a proper regard for the right to make it.
Further, it is assumed that every man
can record an intelligent vote. On that
assumption his right to the vote is based.
But for its own protection surely the com-
munity is entitled to call upon any citizeu
to prove that he has this intelligence.
If one generation has not had the experi-
ence to show that safeguards were neces-
sary, another which has had the experience
is completely justified in applying them.
O
The Cold Feet of Politicians.
Arthur Griffith writes:—
You criticise the Stevens Government for not
having revised the decision of the magistrate who
sentenced the New Guard basher gang to three
months’ gaol and of the Appeal Judge who ■ confirmed
the sentences (expressing regret that he could not
increase them). This criticism can be based only
on the theory that crimes’ of violence committed by
members of the working class are serious criminal
offences, but if committed by members of what
Graham Berry called our “wealthy lower. orders”
are to be regarded as mere playful pranks; and
you quote in support of your contention the regret-
table fact that we have on the Bench in this State
one Judge who apparently holds this view. Had
the Stevens Government yielded to the pressure
brought to bear upon it - to release these men and
thus administer a snub to two of the. few men we
have on the Bench courageous enough to fulfill their
oath “to make the law a terror to evildoers,” such
action would have branded the Government as one
willing to administer justice on a class basis. Per-
sonally I regard this particular outrage as very
much more serious than a spontaneous outbreak of
blackguardism such as occurs in times of industrial
disturbance. The evidence showed that the thing
was deliberately planned, though clumsily carried
out, and really amounted to a conspiracy to commit
a felony—an offence punishable, and properly so,
by penal servitude.
The Government should receive strong commen-
dation for its courage in ignoring powerful influences
and doing its duty regardless of class or caste.
In reply there is room only for this:—
If a number of employers conspired to trick a
number of strikers into assembling at a certain
place and led them on to attack other men, the
real criminals would be the employers and not the
strikers. The Bulletin is very little concerned
about the sentence imposed on. these young men; it
is much concerned about the failure to inquire
whether there was a criminal conspiracy to induce
them to commit an assault. Mr. Weaver’s bold talk
before the elections and his dead silence afterwards
regarding this conspiracy was merely cited as an
illustration of the fact that Ministers seem more
anxious to placate their opponents than to satisfy
their friends. In that connection Mr. Griffith’s letter
is apt. He was a Federal Labor candidate at the
general election the other day.

POINTS
In May the position was a shade better
in some respects and a shade worse in others
in relation to what the N.S.W. Statist calls
“the marked disparity between the relative
price levels of principal rural products and
the non-rural group.” Taking the average
for 1911 as the base (=100), wool in May 1
was 87, wheat 91 and butter 138 ; but non-
rural commodities were 178. Writing about
this “disparity,” a Tas. correspondent says
he sold sheep pelts this year at Id. each, so
he would have had to sell 1200 to buy a
feather coat, valued at a fiver. It mightn’t
be a had idea, seeing that another expensive
tribunal is taking evidence in N. S. Wales
about the living wage and what are “neces-
saries,” if a few farmers’ wives were invited
to present their budgets for the last couple
of years.
Queensland Labor’s in, so up go the taxes.
Moore’s unemployed-relief impost, which was
3d. in the £ for a long time, but was raised
last October to 6d. in the £ on incomes exceed-
ing £2 a week, is now to' be 9d. on £4 to £912.,
and then Is. Casual workers will be exempt,
nor will Federal Government employees be
affected —under a Scullidore enactment their
State unemployed-relief taxes are limited
to 6d. in the £. The object of the new
rates, it is asserted, is “to give the un-
employed relief work at award rates.”
People who fled from Lang-ridden N. S.
Wales to Queensland in Moore’s time will
laugh bitterly.
At the tin-hare inquiry last week Felix
Booth, a Sydney trustee, gave evidence
that, as representative of a syndicate with
a subscribed capital of £7, and an option
over a coursing ground for which he had
paid 10s., he had received a Government
license in six hours by the clock. The
license was applied for at 10.30 a.m.; it was
received, “signed by Mark Gosling,” Lang’s
Chief Secretary, at 4.30 p.m. In effect, his
syndicate “paid 10s. for the option and sold
it for £12,500” ; but he had arranged to give
£7500, as a recompense for “preliminary
work,” to Frederick Charles Shaver Sw,in-
dell, who already had a Government license
—the only one —to race in Sydney. Previ-
ously he had paid Swindell £6OOO in cash
for shares in that gentleman’s dog-racing
“There was a mystery competitor in the Grafton
Cup—Mystical Rose, by Skedaddle. Trained on un-
orthodox lines, it had never started before. It came

co. and in another which, though it had a
ground and an outfit, had been refused a
license. “What did you do with the £6OOO
in notes you got from Felix Booth?” Swin-
dell was asked. “With £3100,” he replied,
“I paid a bill for advertising for the State
Labor party.” The Federal election was
coming on, and “I said I would back the
advertising campaign to the extent of
£4000.” Thus the tin-hare inquiry entered
upon a new phase.
How much further would these high-
exchange-rate enthusiasts really like to de-
preciate our £? In August last year it took
130 of our £ notes to buy 100 sovereigns
or their equivalent in gold dollars. The
high-exchange-rate enthusiasts who were at
the time asking for further depreciation got
it in September and October; but the end
of the latter month it needed 163 of our
£’s to buy the equivalent of 100 sovereigns.
By December the number had gone to £lBO
Australian. And the high-exchange-rate en-
thusiasts were still unsatisfied. As a matter
of fact, inflationists never arc satisfied.
Inflation is just like drinking salt water
because you are thirsty. The more you
inflate the more you want to inflate.

VOYAGEUR O’KELLY (from the Irish Free State): “Shure, an’ I don’t know
if I should be doin’ this at all, at all!”
While De Valera was making speeches and
issuing pronunciamentos, the Saxon Govern-
ment got a week ahead of him with its special
tariff, designed to collect the equivalent of
the land annuities which he “withheld.” The
immediate result was a catastrophic fall in
the local price of Irish farm produce, while
there was an unprecedented boom in Irish
imports of British goods. It is rough on
the Irish farmer, who, as Thomas testifies,
lias always been faithful to his obligations
under the land-purchase scheme, and if the
1 It.A. has its way a bad business will
become worse. Still, one truth emerges
crystal-clear. England and Ireland are neces-
sary to one another, and nothing De Valera
may do or oblige his people to suffer cau
alter the fact. '
Although the maximum weekly pension was
reduced from 20s. to 17s. 6d., Federal old-
age and invalid pensions expenditure reached
the staggering sum of £11,126,000 last year.
This, though £584,000 less than in 1930-31,
was £335,000 more than in 1929-30, and more
than double the amount paid in 1921-22—-
£5,380,000. It absorbed all but £2,354,000
of the yield from income tax, which goes up
to 9s. 6d. in the £. The number of pensions
is just on 250,000, and practically half the
old people in Australia (men of 65 and
women of 60 and upwards) are receiving
them. This points to barefaced and wide-
spread imposition, but the politicians are
afraid to interfere. Still, with wooj and
wheat at unpayable prices and 750,000
persons on the dole, Australia simply can't
go on supporting this immense burden of
non-contributory pensions; and that's flat.
Anyway, it is something when branches of
this and that sit down to think out schemes
for putting Australia on its legs. So The
Bulletin welcomes the circular of the
Gloucester (N.S.W.) branch of the Diggers,
suggesting that an expedition 100 strong, on
military lines, be dispatched to explore the
Northern Territory for minerals. The only
Australian exploring expedition which ever
tried to carry through its job on military lines
was the one Burke and Wills had charge of.
It was not only the most disastrous in Aus-
tralian history, but it passed over part of
the Barrier (Broken Hill) silverfield without
smelling anything, and camped almost on top
of the Mt. Brown goldfield without seeing
anything.
At the moment it looks as if the Vic.
Government is to be the first (or perhaps
the second) to have a pretty thorough over-
haul of State expenditure (Hill hasn’t done
badly in S. Australia). Argyle is out after
a saving of a million a year; and Menzies,
Attorney-General, has weighed in early with
many suggested savings in the law depart-
ments. Aiiiong other things he believes that
the size of juries might be reduced with
advantage to everybody except crooks. And
—though the position in Vic. is not nearly
as bad as it is in N.S.W. —it might be
hinted to Judges that they allow counsel
(especially silks) far too much freedom m
stringing out cases.
Queensland’s new Parliament will open
on August 16. Day sittings, abolished by
Moore, are to be resumed. Increase of the
unemployed-relief tax. restoration of the 44-
hour week and the setting up of an Arbi-
tration Court with power to restore 192!)
rates of pay, if it feels that way inclined,
will figure in the early legislative proposals.
As a result of these measures, and of the
promise to pay award wages for relief work,
there will need to be more taxes, and the
field is restricted. Still, windows, chimneys
and armorial bearings haven’t been touched
The State can be quite as bad as the
flour-miller who won’t let his customers
charge less for bread. The Vie. Electricity
Commission supplies juice at id. a unit
to municipal bodies, which are not allowed
to sell it for less than 5Ad. plus meter rent.
Various councils have abolished this rent
and said nothing about it; now Williams-
town council is asking for authority to
bleed its people a little less —and apparently
nobody but Parliament can give it. For
14 years this council lias been making an
average profit of £15,000 a year, and it is
ashamed to do it any longer. It seems a
case where somebody might promise to have
a blind eye until the law is altered.
Australia’s Big Imports crowd wants the
Federal Government to start meddling with
the rate of exchange, which is the Common-
wealth Bank’s business, and suggests forc-
ing it up £5 per cent. It doesn’t sug-
gest any way of paying the additional
interest. At the same time it clamors for a
reduction of the tariff, to increase imports
and make them harder to pay for, and reduce
the space left for local manufactures. It
argues thus on the alleged authority of a
book written by Adam Smith, who wrote his
great work when George 11. was King, and
when foreign debts hadn’t been invented to
confuse the issue and throw a completely new
light on things.
There was a clash at Cairns (N.Q.) last
week between unemployed who wouldn’t
shift their camp from the showground and
the trustees who wanted the place for tiro
annual show. The police, with a big force of
citizens, cleared the ground and the ambu-
lance carried a dozen people from the battle-
field. The Labor Home Secretary had a good
text for a sermon to both sides; but he
preached only half of it, and that with a
nasty twist —in future, he said, the police
wouldn’t be allowed to be anyone’s basher
gang. But there comes a time when the
police must be a basher gang if another sort
of basher gang isn’t to lay out the law. If
he had said that this was a time when rights
could be pressed too hard and forbearance
practised too little, he would have had the
commonsense of the State cheering him.
Australia has paid away £3,300,078 as
bounty on wheat sold and delivered during
the current year. The bounty goes on till
the end of October, but the staff is to-be dis-
banded on August 15, and the farmer who
comes along between that date and the end
of October is warned that the pay office
will be closed and missing.
A plain-clothes constable in Collingwood
the other day was charged with' taking bribes
from a starting-price bookmaker. Two sub-
inspectors handed two marked notes to the
s.-p. performer, watched the constable call
at the pub where the unlawful business was
done, picked him up as he came out and
found the notes on him. When asked about
them he said he got them iff his pay; later,
apparently smelling a rat, he Green had
paid him a bet he had won. Yet he was
not even committed for trial. Two lady and
two other J’s.P. were on the bench, and the
P.M. was outvoted. Vic. loves its dread-
ful Jaypee system ; and certainly it couldn’t
get the same results any other way.
With half the world snarling at the other
half’s heels, the Australian Government has
thought the time opportune for a further
bludgeoning of the C.M.F. The Defence
Department, stiff as it is with clerks, who in
many cases get much higher pay than war-
riors who distinguished themselves in France
and Palestine, has issued an order limiting
the use of rail warrants for officers and other
ranks attending militia parades. The petti-
fogging ordinance means that militiamen
keen enough to attend unpaid parades ■ will
have to pay their own fares if they are living
less than three miles from the parade ground;
those living more than six miles away must
pay fares after the six-mile limit has been
reached. It is expected that the “economy”
will be warmly welcomed by the Friends of
the Soviet.
In its annual report the Queensland. Gov-
ernment’s Professional Officers’ Association
lauds its joss, the Labor politician. ‘The
party now in power,” the report says,
“can lay just claim to be the best friend
the civil servants ever had”; during the 14
years the Labor party ruled Queensland the
public service received the fairest treatment
it ever had.” Wliat sort of a deal the
general public got is not mentioned, though
it found the money to pay for this vicarious
generosity.
Prohibition, after 15 years’ trial, looks
more and more like being an exploded delu-
sion in the U.S.A., but it is hard to say
for certain. About ten of the States —in-
cluding New York, which revolted ten years
ago—have intimated that they won’t assist m
enforcing the prohibition law.; so the Fed-
eral Government has to do it all, and if
it enlisted a sufficient force the bill would
break Uncle’s Treasury. But it is by no means
clear whether the dissenting State Govern-
ments object to prohibition, or. whether their
officials want to go into the illicit-drink busi-
ness themselves, with no opposition except
such as the feeble Federal authorities can
offer. If so, some of the. States which refuse
to help in enforcing the law may demand
that the law shall stand because their, poli-
ticians make so much money by breaking it.
One can’t break a law which doesn’t exist.

China is reported to be negotiating with
the Soviet for a non-aggression pact and
for mutual non-recognition of the Japanese
occupation of Manchuria. The Chinese have
no love for the Communists, but their
national Government was established with
Russian help, and they are grateful for that.
On the other hand, they are not a bit grate-
ful to the League of Nations for its failure
to stop the Japanese at Shanghai and Mukden.
Tinder the so-called Stimson doctrine, Uncle
Sam has also declared his refusal to recog-
nise Nipponese claims in Manchuria. Inter-
national necessities make queer bedfellows.

“Thrill”: What looked like a sensational
crime came unglued in Brisbane the other
day. Three people rushed along to a
suburban police station to say they had seen
a motorist drh-e over a man and then get
out of. the car, throw his victim callously
inside and drive off at top speed. The Johns
rang up all the hospitals, but neither there
nor anywhere else could they get on the trail
of the car or the corpse. While they were still
pondering on, the station doorstep one of
them noticed an approaching motor tacking
all over the road. The car was stopped, and
the driver and lavo passengers were found to
be so drunk that they were invited into the
station. Inquiries revealed that earlier in
the evening one of the passengers had
fallen overboard, and that the driver had
gone to his rescue and placed him inside
again.. That. solved the mystery, and every-
one went home, satisfied except the trio in
the car. They stopped the night in the cells.

“Nakhoda” : Melbourne under the present
gold boom reminds me of Singapore under
tlie rubber boom, round about 1910. It was
supposed in London and other far places
that Singapore, being in the heart of the
potential rubber-producing country, would
knoAV all about the business and not lose its
head. Consequently, companies founded in
the City of the Lion enjoyed a prestige
abroad of which they promptly made the
most. Shady Dutchmen, with concessions of
rubber land from alleged Malayan potentates,
wrote out prospectuses on tlieir shirt cuffs
in the lobbies of hotels and the issue Avas
oversubscribed while the shirt was going, to
the wash. Singapore, in short, was doing
exactly what London was. The more remote
the site of the proposed attack on the jungle
the more romantic it seemed, and it was the
craving for ronrance Avhieh the company pro-
moters catered for. A company floated to ex-
ploit the perfectly good soil of the neighboring
State ;of Johore was less favorably looked
upon than a company designed to operate
in Celebes, Sarawak or mysterious islands
farther away still. I bought a few shares
in an estate at Brunei, Borneo, largely, 1
think, because Brunei was known as the
Asiatic Venice, and was ruled over by a
sultan who had 49 wives. Later I had a
chance to visit my estate and found its
Venetian character well exemplified. Of its
10.000 acres, 9910 were under Avater at
high tide.
“Sur Gifigle”: “Second to None” (B.
20/7/’32) is not the first to put in a good
word for the shock-absorbing qualities of
busbies, bearskins and other types of fur lid
affected by the British Army. Blatchford has
recorded an incident of the days when he
Avas in the Dublin Fusiliers, more than 60
years ago. The Dublins were on manoeuvres
in Devon. One morning the whole regiment
heard the Colonel addressing the Adjutant in
stentorian tones: “Captain Blank, the
farmers around here are complaining that my
men are making off with all the rabbits. The
Brigadier will be along presently. I’m cer-
tain if the haversacks of my men are in-
spected, not a single rabbit will be found !”
That prediction came true. And not a single
Fusilier in Devon that day complained of
the size or Aveight of his busby.
“JungOr”: Queer that the New States
agitation should have awakened no respon-
sive echoes outside of N. S. Wales. Ten or
12 years ago the movement was continent-
wide; every State had its advocates for
splitting up, except the Speck. Westralia
was as hearty as any. In 1922 there was
a conference of Ncav Staters at Albury, and
on his way thither a whiskered storekeeper-
cocky, from Geraldton (a former M.L.A.)
dropped in at The Bulletin office, filled
Avith the importance of his mission. He pro-
duced a whole packet of credentials showing
him the authorised representative of the
aggrieved citizens of Champion Bay, the
farmers of the Greenough and the squatters
of the Murchison, all of them yearning to
cut loose the shackles that bound them to
a centralising Government in Perth, a Avhoh-
-800 miles away; and he left for Albury with
blood and fire in his eye. Yet nowadays
nobody seems to bother about subdivision
outside of the parent State, and, if it
weren’t for Lang, it is doubtful if there
would be much doing here. Westralia hqs
become so obsessed Avith its own grievances
against Canberra that those of its own north
and south and its goldfields against Perth
have receded into the shadows.

“Pantagruel”: All things considered, Can-
berra seems to be a fairly sober place. The
convictions for drunkenness were 69 last
year, 74 the year before, 113 the year
before that, and 121 in 1928-29, the year
after the Federal Capital went wet. The
Prohibition Alliance, however, declines to be
• comforted by the steady drop. It points out
that in the year preceding the introduction
of liquor licenses into the Territory the con-
victions for drunkenness were only four.
The inference drawn seems hardly justifiable.
It was not easy to get intoxicated in Can
berra before 1928, owing to the restriction of
facilities, and quite impossible to drink to
excess at a pub (the setting for most exces-
sive drinking), there being none. And if a
man went to Queanbeyan, as so many did.
and miscalculated his capacity for strong
waters there, the chances were that he would
be either shot in by the N.S.W. police or
have a chance to get partially sober before
he returned home. The figures for drunken-
ness at Canberra, if they are to throw any
real light on the efficacy of prohibition,
should be accompanied by the Queanbeyan
records.
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
“My writing was the best in the class yesterday, Gran.”
“Ah! Did the teacher say that?”
“No—but I saw all the others.”
“Guy Tabary”: The big cities of the
U.S.A. have established a grim record for
crime and lawlessness, and it Avould seem
that the police can be just as rcvoltingly
lawless as anyone else. The latest light upon
the “third degree” is furnished by a New
York inquiry, in the course of which testi-
mony Avas given that a deputy-police chief
had described one Hyman Stark as “the
toughest I ever suav. I stood with one
foot on his neck and the other on his body,
and rocked him back and forth.” Hyman
died of a broken larynx. They knew a lot
about torture in mediaeval times, notably
in France; Villon has some querulous
references to the unpleasantness of being
filled up with water to force him to
loosen his tongue. But even there they
generally stopped short of killing their
man, although “the archers” (the Pari-
sian police), according to one historian,
were frequently of no bettor character than
the criminals whom they had to arrest. The
same reflection seems equally applicable to
some of Uncle Sam’s police. In any case,
of what value is a confession obtained by
standing: on a suspect’s body and rocking
him back and forth?

“Aururn”: I note that the professor avlio
has been interesting European scientists
in his formula for the production of
gold from the baser metals has skied
the towel. It is curious how the
craze for the discovery of the philo-
sopher’s stone, as it Avas once called, has
survived from the beginning of history. I
often wonder whether the failure of the mil-
lions of men who have deA’oted their lives to
the making of gold is due to the fact that
the transmutation of metals is a physical
impossibility, or to the inability of those
conducting the researches to adhere strictly
to the formula. I have before me a recipe,
the original of Avhieh Avas compiled 600
years ago. The final sentence reads, “By no
means during the trial must the searcher
permit himself to think of a rhinoceros;
to do so is fatal to success.” Naturally,
people reading that injunction, though
throughout their blameless lives they had
never even imagined a rhinoceros, would
henceforth think of little else, experiment
or no experiment.

“Farleigh”: I suggest that the importance
of remembering felloAV-humans' faces, the
faculty developed to such perfection by the
Sydney club liall-porter avlio died the other
day (B. 20/7/’32), should be impressed on
youngsters at school, and hammered in by
practical lessons, as being of much more use
than lots of the things they are taught to
remember. The ability to recall faces is a
real asset in dozens of callings and trades
besides those of club servants and detectives ;
and the persistent failure to do so is a dam-
aging handicap. I speak feelingly as one
who could never remember any new acquaint-
ance until I had seen him at least half
a dozen times, even in the days when the
great majority of men were not cut to the
clean-shaved pattern of the present genera-
tion. Probably a good memory for faces
comes naturally to many people—Queen Vic-
toria and King Edward were credited with
never forgetting anyone they had met offi-
cially or socially, although considering the
thousands of people that they did meet' it
seems beyond belief. Royalty may have a
gift that way, but I suspect it is only because
it has to be assiduously cultivated. If the
great of the earth can acquire it there is no
reason why others shouldn’t. I am not
much concerned about politicians, but I sus-
pect that in their case a quick and retentive
memory for the faces of those whom they
have met, however long ago or for however
brief a period, has a solid value in votes.
“Kyn”: Regarding grades of knighthood
(B. 20/7/’B2), W. A. Zeal and .T. M. Davies,
two former Presidents of Vic. Uppish House,
each held out for a K.C.M.G. when offered
an inferior brand of knighthood, and gol
it. There was a little delay, but that was
all. The correspondence was published in
the case of Zeal, and made piquant reading.

“Binduli”: The devotion to duty of that
Vic. policeman who had a good tooth pulled
to secure evidence of a breach of the Dental
Act reminds me of the self-sacrificing action
of an analyst in Ivalgoorlie a quarter of a
century ago. He was German, spectacled
and thorough, benevolent too. A consign-
ment of tinned milk came under suspicion
of being on the rotten side; it was seized
and the analyst’s opinion bespoken about its
wholesomeness. lie subjected it to the usual
chemical tests but. dubious as it appeared,
he wasn’t quite satisfied that it Avas unfit
for human consumption. So he made him-
self a cup of tea. infused a generous dollop
of the questionable stuff, and after consum-
ing it, sat down with professional calmness
to await results. They were so drastic and
protracted that the expert avus unable to
give evidence when the case Avas listed next
day. It had to be postponed, but his first-
hand testimony, a Aveek later, Avas so con-
clusive that a stiff fine was imposed and the
rest of the milk Avent to the incinerator.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]

That merely giving Lang the axe
Won’t smooth the path of Stevens.
I think ’twere well, Avith all the ruts ’

They spent less, time in scratching nuts
And more in scratching gravel.

It’s better going back to graft
Than going “back to Grafton.”
I grudge no limelight that it brings
To Isaacses and Pages,
But glowing words are worthless things
Compared with living wages. „
I think it’s still as true as in
The Gospels and Epistles,
That grapes from thorns one may not win
Or gather figs from thistles.
I think the fruit of fruit machines
For those in pubs that set them
Was, paradoxically, beans- —
And in the end they’ll get them.
I think a wild Jack hare’s a treat,
To hunt or stow within one,
But with antipathy complete
I contemplate the tin one.
I trust they’ll tear him limb from limb,
This pack of legal codgers,
But Avhile I feel no rue for him
I’ve lots for Justice Rogers';
I think the notion that below
The rainbow gold is hidden
Is excellent for Ikey Mo
And just as well for Whiddon.
I think at OttaAva they’ll make
Perchance some history striking.
While you and I can only take
A hand at mystery-hiking.
"Is your husband good at these old-time dances?”
" Well, I haven't found out anything to the contrary yet.”
I think the price of wool might heat
A curate ’ncath the collar;
I think the dole is hard to beat
For dolus or for dolor.
Some say, with States in sections cut,
A brighter era waits men.
I think new States are needed, but
I’d sooner see new Statesmen.
I think that even Uncle Sam
Alay find conditions better
When Prohibition’s specious sham
Is shelved for something Avetter.
My faith it is that beef and beer
Were made for food and drinking.
And whatsoe’er Ave’ve suffered here,
Twas nothing quite so drab and drear
As liis ordeal, I’m thinking.

“Runa”: Some years ago a Maoriland sea-
side resort became extraordinarily popular,
one of its attractions being an excellent
ginger beer produced locally. It was sold
in large bottles and the drowsiness that
followed was attributed to the ozone.
Artists arriving to sketch the landscape,
youths escorting the girl-friend to the
beach, mothers in charge of juvenile
bathing parties, all seemed possessed by the
same idea—to prop themselves against a com-
fortable sand dune and go to sleep. The
climax came after a Sunday-school picnic,
when the parson was unable to muster
his flock for the return journey, the
sale of ginger beer having been parti-
cularly brisk that day. Nice young girls,
respectable matrons, blameless heads of
families and earnest young churchmen were
scattered over the sandhills in all directions,

“C.Q ”: Melbourne’s habit of thinking of
Victoria as Melbourne has resulted in more
Victorian centenaries being forgotten than
observed. Cook sighted Point Hicks in 1770
and Collins formed a penal settlement at
Sorrento in 1802. So anxious are dwellers
by the Yarra to regard Batman or Fawk-
ner as the founder of the State that it has
always been taken for granted that the
pioneering of the Ilentys at Portland, whien
began with the arrival from Launceston of
the schooner Thistle on Nov. 19, 1834, was
only a whaling enterprise. But in the
vessel’s manifest whaling equipment was not
mentioned, though building materials, agri-
cultural implements, 46 head of cattle and
some seed were. In 1866 Edward Henty put
his own case against Fawkner in the Port-
land “Guardian.” “When the Honorable
John,” he wrote, “was busy building for
himself a house in Melbourne, I and my
brother Francis had been comfortably domi-
ciled in our house nearly 12 months, and,
having finished shearing, were then preparing
to reap our first harvest.” So Melbourne
ought at least to make some sort of pilgrim-
age to Portland on Nov. 19, 1934, in return
for Portland’s recognition of its right to
hold a local jollification in the following year.

“Locre”: The Americans are complaining
that three-fifths of the 10,000 ex-servicemen
who have camped in Washington and mean
to stay there till they are paid bonuses for
their alleged war services never left the
U.S.A. during the war. Considering that
of the Americans who did go overseas only
about 30 per cent, ever saw the firing-line,
the proportion of fighting men among those
who are kicking up a row about their hero-
ism in the U.S.A. capital is puny. Human
nature is like that all over the world. Before
a war the loudest skiters on the subject of
the Flag are Empire Leaguers and the
like. When a war arrives they become paci-
fists for the duration, if they can’t grab safe
base or transport jobs. After a war the men
who make most, noise about their grievances
are always those who showed most skill in
dodging the line. Many go into Parliament,
and exploit designations to which they have
no right in military law. America is the
national personification of this kind of
impostor.
“S.T.S.”: The latest novelty in defences
to a dangerous-driving charge has cropped
up in Adelaide in the simple statement, “I
was in a hurry to get to a funeral.” The
“up to 45 m.p.h.” pacer in suburban streets
was quite in earnest; his job was delivering
wreaths around the city, and all were needed
in a hurry. A small fine met the 'case —
with a strong hint that the offender might
be hastening his own funeral.
“Lex”: In a recent week Sydney journals
have drawn attention to a dangerous South-
ern European who is supposed to carry an
automatic and a curved dagger, and who, with
his beautiful mistress, is capable of any
crime; to a brace of malefactors who have
just arrived from England, where they have
been swindling people out of large fortunes;
and to a murderer who is being trailed round
by the paper’s investigators, but in other
respects appears to be finding life as agree-
able as the rest of us. The deceased “Watch-
man” used to run anti-Romish stories on
similar lines. One got me quite worked up
till I dropped to the technique. It was
about three Orangemen who were acciden-
tally locked in St. Mary’s Cathedral. At
midnight the organ burst into the thunderous
strains of the notorious High Mass in H
by Oleagini. and a procession of monks
appeared dragging a shrieking female figure
clad in white. A stone was raised in the
middle of the aisle and the lady was en-
tombed. After which there was a short
service, and the function terminated. The
stupefied Orangemen saw it all from behind
a pillar, and when day dawned and the
Pathedral doors were opened they fled and
revealed all. To the police? No. To the
“Watchman.” To prove their bona fidcs the
paper indicated them by the letters “X,”
“Y” and “Z.” Nothing more was heard of
the outrage. I was never able to be-
lieve in the “Watchman” sensations that
followed, and eventually ceased to be a sub-
scriber. Similarly I can’t work up any
shudders about that anonymous homicide
from Southern Europe, or about the un-
specified emperors of crime from England,
or about the nameless assassin who goes
through life with a herd of reporters peering
at him from behind doors and the like. It
is a sad deprivation, involving the loss of
a good deal of innocent pleasure.

especially against the
more ruffianly crim-
inal element, but their
employment is sub-
ject to unavoidable
limitations. Before
the war Queensland
experimented with a
special breed of Ger-
man police dogs, a
batch of which was
imported. Their pro-
geny was entrusted
to a trainer from
Germany, and under
him severa 1 local
men, well used to
the training of the
Australian sheep-
dog, learned the busi-
ness. The experi-
ment was ultimately
abandoned, the main
reason being that the
dogs could only be
worked by the" one
man whom they
knew. Another
drawback was that
they could not be
taught to employ
harmless grips when
seizing a man. Some-
times they were
satisfied with hi s
clothing; at other
times they were
painfully indifferent
so long as they got
a firm hold.
“S.T.S.” : A threat,
which was successful
and seems perfectly
lawful, has been
used by defending
counsel in an Adel-
aide police court. A
suburban tobacconist
was charged with
keeping a “common
gaming- h ous e.”
Bridge played for
money, with sweeps
or si d e-w age r s,
seemed to be - the
main crime, an d
there were 34 other
men concerned. Their
lawyer said that
each of them would
plead not guilty, and
“each case will have to be fought out on its
merits.” On which the S.M. protested that
he hadn’t 85 days to spare, and was “sick
to death” of these gambling cases, anyway.
The police, after consultation, withdrew all
charges but one; and that one then pleaded
guilty and paid £2.
“D.”: The liousemaidenly tendency of
Sydney’s stunt papers to make swans of
their geese was humorously displayed in
connection with the recent visit of a policeman
to “52 Macleay-street.” The “Sun” headed
a splurge on the subject “A Millionaire for
a Week,” and described how the sleuth was
able to get into “this exclusive, guest-house”
—as one might say “this exclusive tram-
car.” He worked the oracle, it appears, by
a display of “luxurious cars and luggage,”
and soon the pleasure-loving aristas of the
place were “seeking to gain admission to his
exclusive parties.” He had a valet and “an
exclusive and luxurious suite”: and the
cost of the entire bust (referred to as “a
regal week”) was £7 16s. 6d., or a couple
of quid more than the Australian living wage
—defined by Higgins as “the average needs
of a human being in a civilised community”
—as recommended by “Good Ole Piddo” in
1920.
“Bloggs”: The “S. M. Herald” remarked
last week:—
For several months letting has supplied the
brightest feature of the real estate market. A
question the agents find hard to answer is: “Where
have the people now renting flats, houses and
cottages been living for the past year or so?”
The answer is simple: “On bust ’bus routes.”
Lang’s asinine Transport Act made scores
of districts inaccessible to people with-
out cars, and wherever possible ’they
moved in and took cottages or flats near
tram or railway lines. Darlinghurst has
been one of the chief beneficiaries. When
the slump began it had hundreds of flats,
furnished and otherwise, empty. Now crooks,
mummers, urgers, “Sunday Sun” society
stars, pugilists and others who frequent the
place can only get the humblest kind of
shelter at exorbitant figures. A twin lesson
in the importance of transport and in the
law of supply and demand.
“Felo D. S.”: The dismissed farmhand
who callously killed two defenceless women
near Cooma (N.S.W.) last week, and there-
with became the quarry of “an intensive
man-hunt” in snow-covered country, only
managed to evade his pursuers by suicide as
deliberate as his crime. He tried to drown
himself in a lagoon; then sought to hang
himself with his braces. These broke, but
he accomplished his exit from the world
with a piece of fencing-wire. Braces are
unreliable nooses, but their possibilities, as
well as those of other necessaries of mascu-
line attire; are always taken into considera-
tion by those entrusted with the charge of
persons who may seek to evade the law by
self-destruction. When Roger Casement
figured at Bow-street, it was regarded as
significant that he appeared in the dock with
no laces in his boots. And when R. L.
Stevenson suffered temporary detention m
a Fteneh country lock-up in the ’seventies,
on the preposterous suspicion of being a
German spy, his boots were removed by
his custodians before he was left to him-
self, the reason being given that he, might
attempt suicide. “But 1 could hang myself
with my braces if I wanted to,” objected
Louis, than whom no man was ever, less
likely to hang himself. However, the French
police left him his braces.
THROUGH THE PRELIMB.
BERT: "There’s Daise! How is she getting on with her breach-
of-promise case?”
SYD: “Great! She’s passed her cross-examination.”
“C.Q.”: Melbourne “Age" caused a mild
sensation by printing a letter in which the
public was warned that there was a movement
afoot to erect a garage for clerical motor-cars
on the piece of vacant land adjoining the east
side of St. Paul’s Cathedral, until recently
hidden under builders’ material. Inquiry at
the Town Hall elicited the information that
there was nothing in the building regulations
to prevent the scheme, though the council
had power to veto it on aesthetic grounds.
Meanwhile, the diocesan authorities were
announcing that no such vandalism was con-
templated, though a member of the church
had suggested that money could be made-out
of something of the sort. A reasonable idea
would be to turn the area into a cathedral
close, with chairs in it, where the tired citi-
zen could temporarily seek surcease from
worldly cares and contemplate the infinite.
Since the habitues were turned off the G.P.O.
steps there is no such spot in the city.
“Gunner’s Mate”: If a naval seaman of
Marryat’s day were to revisit the glimpses
of the moon he would be out of soundings
in no time. Many of the old ranks and
ratings of his day have gone—masters and
mates, for instance —and dozens of others
have supplanted them. Leaving out the
engineers, the old-time purser is now trans-
formed into a paymaster with commissioned
rank. The latest departure by the Lords
of the Admiralty is the commissioning of
navy cooks. This rank is only to be granted
to food-manipulating experts whose services
in instructional and supervisory duties are
required ashore. Feeling that commissioned
cooks can hardly be referred to as “cook-
lieutenant” as in the case of “engineer-
admiral” and so on. My Lords have attached
them to the Pay branch. In future the
commissioned slushy will be known as “Pay-
master So-and-So (C),” the initial denoting
his actual calling. Commissioned store-
keepers and stewards are also provided for.
“Oxmead” : Even the highest church digni-
taries can fall back at times on those homely
vernacularisms that never fail to bring a
frown to the bewigged brow of Judge Cur-
lewis. Thus “Synodsman,” writing to the
“S. M. Herald” on the controversy
occasioned by the endeavor to impose an un-
acceptable incumbent on the parishioners of
St. Barnabas, Chatswodd :
To use the Archbishop’s own words in his sermon
at the induction ceremony, the pitch had been
queered.
To queer anyone’s pitch is an expressive
Coekneyism ; “to jeopardise a transaction or
spoil a chance” is the dictionary’s polite
interpretation. It is probable, however, that
it has been, largely superseded in popular
parlance by the phrase that Cecil Rhodes
employed when word was brought to him of
the Jameson Raid—“ Poor old Jameson ! ho
has upset my applecart.” Still, though an
Empire-builder might talk about upsetting
applecarts, an Archbishop could hardly do
it; with a choice of two metaphors which
mean precisely the same thing, the older one
sounds less startling from a pulpit.
THE BARROWMEN'S CHORUS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Mayor of Sydney complains that the barrow-
men with' whom the city is over-run persist in
calling- out their wares in raucous and annoying
voices.’’
O you who fruit and vegetables vend us
From bursting barrows busy kerbs that
line,
Relentlessly your voices rack and rend us.
Why you should puff the peanut and the
pine
With din so deafening, discord so stupen-
dous,
I find it none too easy to divine.
Prithee, desist from these bombastic blares.
Ring off, and leave the talking to your
wares.
Forbear to eulogise the sleek tomato,
To boom the broccoli and brussels sprout
With this infernal orgy of staccato,
This clamorous challenge and defiant
shout.
Or else the devastating obbligato
Will queer your pitch and leave you down
and out.
Limits there are perforce in every land
To what the human tympanum can stand.
It might be possible for an Italian
In lilting language whereof lovers wot
To chant the charms of cabbage or of
scallion
(A handy synonym for the shallot),
But for a Saxon barrowside battalion
It’s patently and obviously not.
They were not framed for harmony, your
tongues,
For all the vim and vigor of your lungs.
Hi I there, you stalwart with the chestnut-
heater,
The latest innovation on our streets,
And you of apple-slogans the repeater,
Hi! booster of bananas or of beets
Or beans: “Heard melodies are sweet but
sweeter
Are those unheard” —-he knew his onions,
Keats!
Leave those you’ve ranged upon your mobile
shelves
To do the needful spruiking for themselves.

WHEN MAKING YOUR WILL
REMEMBER THIS
MANY men believe that in making their will they are
bequeathing their whole property to their dependents.
In actual fact this is not so. Probate tax makes a
heavy inroad into many bequests. To overcome this difficulty,
the P. & C. Probate Assurance was evolved. It provides the
ideal solution, pays for probate tax, obviates forced sales and
provides adequate money for dependents during the long assess-
ment period. Discuss the matter with their representatives or

PERSONAL
ITEMS
General Charlie Brand, Quartermaster-
General of the C.M.F., is retiring from the
service—he will be 60 on Sept. 3. He
learned the business of war as a Light
Horseman in South Africa, like so many of
the leaders of the A.1.F., his regiment being
the 3rd Queenslanders. Joining the perman-
ent forces, he Avas on Gallipoli as Brigade-
Major of the 3rd, and particularly distin-
guished himself during the bitter fighting
just after the Landing. Promotion followed
rapidly; in France ho rose to the command
of the 4th Infantry Brigade and, for a
time, of the 4th Division. Since those
days Brand has been Commandant in
various States before taking on his final job
of Q.M.G.
James Hislop, ay ho died in M.L. the other
day, aged 62, made a name for himself in
his younger days as the ideal private, secre-
tary. He started his p.s. career with Ward
and served the baronet in that capacity for
12 years. So tactful and adroit was lie
that he made not a single enemy for his
chief or himself, a most remarkable record
in such circumstances. As soon as Ward
succeeded to Seddon’s shoes Hislop Avas
made Under-Secretary of Internal Affairs,
in which' capacity he shepherded EdAvard P.,
the Yorks, Birdie and Allenby. Though he had
his share, of the dry humor of his Scottish
ancestors —his dad hailed from Stirling-—the
keynote of liis secretarial success was com-
plete solemnity. Dressed always in black,
with a black tie, lie was a walking monu-
ment of responsibility and respectability.
But he was as kindly as he was firm, and
as suave as he was shrCvyd, and his retire-
ment four years ago was regretted by every
good man in liis department.
Just-dead Alfred Andrew Patterson was
a Swede and a university graduate who came
to Australia in his twenties and worked as
a surveyor on the Mount Bischoff railway
in the Speck. Then he crossed to N.S.W. and
enlisted in the Soudan contingent, but a
sudden illness took him out of the ranks.
He mixed engineering with landscape gar-
dening, and leaves a memorial to his pro-
ficiency in the park at Bathurst designed by
him on the site of the old gaol. During the
visit of the present King and Queen many
of the floral decorations of Sydney were
carried out by A. A. Patterson. He num-
bered among his personal friends Henry
Parkes and George Reid.
John Brownlee, who is delighting Vic.
concert audiences, is one of the young men
whom success has not spoiled, probably
because his is so well deserved. Leaving
a Geelong business career in 1923 to go
to London for training under Dinh Gilly on
the advice cf Melba, he so far justified her
faith in his promise 'as to sing Avitli her in
“Boheme” at Covent Garden three years
later. In 1927 Australians at the Paris Opera
House were thrilled to hear the ovation he
JOHN BROWNLEE, the Australian singer.
received for his performance in “Thais,”
and this, his 31st year, finds him singing
at the top of the tree. Brownlee’s concert
performance is marked by its freedom from
platform peculiarities, by his geniality and
gehetosity to his audiences and his courtesy
to his accompanist and supporting artists.
He lias varnished hair and a pleasant smile,
and Melba was godmother to his countess’s
bahy.
Frederick Pascoe Gordon, who has died at
Manly at 79, had some of Australia’s early
notables in the family tree. His father came
from Scotland over 100 years ago ; his mother
was a Maearthur, a cousin of the founder of
the wool industry; and he was a great-grand-
son of Governor lying. F. P. Gordon, after
leaving King's School, started on his life’s
business at Martar, near BraidAvood, his
father’s station; thence he went to Bowen
(Q.) ; returning to N.S.W., he became a land
valuer for Goldsbrough, Morts and the
A.M.P. He retired five years ago.

“Bells and Hobbles,” by Bulletin poet
E. J. Brady, has been set to music by
Horace Gleeson, given tongue to by Peter
Dawson and canned by a leading English
gramophone company.
An unusual coincidence was disclosed in
a recent case, Hook r. Hook, in the N.S.W.
Divorce Court. It was the late Archdeacon
BoyCe who performed the marriage cere-
mony 21 years ago; it was his son, Justice
Boyce, who untied the knot on the appli-
cation of the wife.
Charles Dickens’s last surviving son —the
only one who rose to any eminence—is re-
tiring after a lengthy professional career.
This is Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, who
has been Common Sergeant of London,
assistant Judge to the Recorder at the Old
Bailey, for the past 15 years, and who didn’t
find his duties too heavy for him till he was,
well into the eighties—he was born in 1849,
sixth son of the novelist. Henry Dickens
was called to the Bar nearly 60 years ago,
and took silk 40 years back. He published
“Memoirs of My Father” in 1928.
Colonel George Short, who died at New-
castle last week at 71, found time for sol-
diering as well as banking. He joined the
Commercial Bank of Sydney when fresh
from school, and for 30 years before his re-
tirement 11 years ago he Avas manager of the
NeAvcastlo branch. He was also officer in
charge of the Newcastle Garrison Artillery
on the outbreak of war, and he left his desk
and his ledgers for active service'on Galli-
poli and in France.
Three former permanent heads of Vic.
Chief Scc.’.s Department who succeeded re-
cently-dead C. A. Topp are still on deck—
G. C. Morrison, YV. A. Callaway and C. G.
Green. Morrison, like Topp, became Public
Service Commissioner.
Khan Bahadur Sikander Hyatt Khan is
a name that will be marked with a white istone
in Indian records as that of the first native
of India to be placed in charge of one of
the great Provinces. He Avill be the-official
head of the Punjab during the absence on
leave of the Governor, Sir Geoffrey Mont-
gomery. The Khan is a Pathan—and, of
course, a Moslem—and has a distinguished
war service, like so many of his fighting race.
His family bulks big in Indian history. His
father, Sirdar Muhammad, was the native
officer whom the dying John Nicholson, after
the storming of Delhi in the Indian Mutiny,
recommended with almost his last breath for
special recognition by the Sirkar.
Died lately in London at 73, Fergus
Hume, author of “The Mystery of a Han-
som Cab.” Although the sales have reached
something like half a million. Hume pro-
fited little. As a Melbourne law clerk he
turned out one of the forerunners of the
mystery-novel craze, and was glad enough
to sell the rights for £5O ; not another penny
did he get. Years later when “The Mystery
of a Hansom Cab” was successfully filmed,
the producer (Arthur Shirley) received a
letter from Hume mentioning that he was
practically destitute. The son of a Maori-
lander, Hume was born in London.
Captain George Butler, passed out at
Drummoyne (Sydney) at 73, joined the
training ship Worcester on the Thames 60
years ago' and spent most of his life on blue
water. He came to Australia in his twenties
and was first with the Howard Smith line
and later with the A.U.S.N. Co. A shipmate
in the Worcester was Togo, who was to
become Japan’s greatest admiral.
Latest occupant of the editorial chair of
the Christchurch (M.L.) “Press” is Hugo
Frecth. erstwhile of the “S. M. Herald”
staff, and a resident of Sydney for 10 years
past. Hugo is a son of the late Pierce C.
Ireeth, who was for a while editor of
Christchurch “Star.” and the son has also
pursued the Inky Way in the City of the
Plains, for he was on the reporting staff of
the “Lyttelton Times’’ just before the Great
V ar. He joined the N.Z.E.F. as a ranker,
gained a commission while on active ser-
vice, and for a while was a musketry
instructor at Sling Camp, where he put up
an Empire shooting record. Lately he has
taken to golf, and a feAv weeks ago he
broke the Mosman links record three times
in one day. Freeth is a product of Welling-
ton College, where lie distinguished himself
in football and swimming, and is still three
years short of his 40th milestone.
S. W. Mackay, who died in Sydney the
other day, made a name as a sporting- jour-
nalist on “S. M. Herald.” Born in Wagga,
he began, his working life as a telegraphist,
contributing much sporting matter to the
press until he joined the “Herald” 22 years
ago. A keen cricketer and footballer, he was
also a noted amateur rider at one time, one
of his early mounts being Ben Bolt, later
to win the Caulfield Cup.
John F. Ilennessy, who has just taken up
liis little lot in Geelong cemetery, was
half a century on the Inky Way. He worked
on the Geelong “Times” when Benjamin
Hoare was editor. Latterly ha was the
Age” correspondent at the Pivot, where ho
knew and was liked by everybody.
Margaret Cuthbertson, who l has been
urging the -recognition of women pioneers in
any permanent memorial of Melbourne’s (or
Victoria’s) centenary, is entitled to a good
hearing, for no one has done more to improve
the lot of womankind in the State. For 30
years or thereabouts she was inspector of
factories, first under Harrison Orde, then
under H. M. Murphy, and latterly under
Stevens, and she helped materially to make
the wages-board system workable and to
abolish the bad old sweating conditions for
white-workers and others. It was her firm-
ness and tact that won the majority of
employers over. She retired eight years ago.
As chairman of
Vic. Water Com-
mission for 17
years, William
Cattanach, who
passed over in Mel-
bourne the other
day, as the result
of an accident in-
curred at Can-
berra, controlled
over £24,000,000
worth of utilities.
The supply sys-
tem that he man-
aged in the Mallee
covers 11,000
square miles of
country and is the
largest of its kind
in the world. Cat-
tanaeh was a pro-
tege of Tommy
Bent, who recog-
nised his capacity
when he was driv-
ing a humble quill
for the munici-
pality of Fleming-
ton. He was a
Scotch College and
Melb. University
product, and was
in his 60th year.
F. M. Johnston. ,
who was for some <
years surveyor-in-
charge on the War
Service II o m e s
Commission at Syd-
ney, has been ap-
pointed surveyor
and property officer
in the Common-

was for many years Surveyor-General there
and Senator E. B. Johnston is a brother.
George Charles Gollan, the new M.L.A.
for Parramatta, is a genial giant in his
middle forties. Born on the Richmond
River, he started earning a crust as a
teacher. His first school was at a place called
Riley’s Hill, and some of his pupils were
taller and older than himself. At 23 he
ceased to be a dominie and entered the com-
mercial world. He has run businesses at
Bellingen, Goulburn and Auburn, chiefly

newsagencies. In Auburn, where he has
lived for a long time, he has sat on the local
municipal council for 10 years—he was
Mayor for two terms —and has been presi-
dent of the Auburn District Hospital. Dur-
ing recent years he has never needed more
than four hours’ sleep; he goes to bed about
2 a.m. and is up again before the milkman
calls. This ability to keep awake should
serve him well in Macquarie-street.
Thomas Walker, freethought lecturer, elo-
cutionist, playwright, journalist, M.L.A. for
six years in N.S.W. and for 26 in Westralia,
and finally Speaker of the Assembly, left an
estate valued at over £6OOO.
G. F. H'olden, Melb. Harbor Trust chair-
man, is in his 20th year as port authority
boss, having been appointed by Watt, then
Premier, in 1913. During the 14 years
Holden was M.D.A. for Warrenheip he
never held office, but Bent made him head
of Geelong Harbor Trust, where he qualified
for the bigger job.
,T. A. Isaacs, solicitor, of Auburn (Vic.),
a brother of the Governor-General, looked
like becoming a politician once. He repre-
sented Ovens in the Legislative Assembly
from 1894 to 1902, and earned the sobriquet
of “Tobacco Jack” for his championship of
the struggling leaf cultivators of the n.-e.
district.
Australian actor Claude Flemming, now
a producer-director of talkie travelogues in
natural color, turned up in London recently
with a batch of interesting pictures for
world-wide distribution. These days he re-
presents an American organisation, has a
roving commission, and as head man of a
producing outfit has penetrated into the
Bavarian Alps, Northern Africa, “out-back’’
Hawaii and elsewhere, and will probably
come to Australia to make a talking scenic
or two in the Far North.
Johns and Jameses (seven of each) pre-
dominate in the new Vic. Assembly. There
are five Thomases, four Alberts, four Henrys
(including a Harry), three Georges and the
same number of Williams and Franks (in-
cluding a Francis). Among the holders of
fancy first monikers are Premier Argyle
(Stanley), Blackburn (Maurice), Brig.-
Gen. Bourchier (Murray), Kent Hughes
(Wilfrid), Shields (Clive), Cooper (Athol)
and Wettenhall (Marcus). Chief Sec. Mac-
farlan (lan) and Diffey (Lot) run a dead
heat for the shortest labels. Surnames
begin with Allan and end with Zwar —the
first Zedder since the days of Zox. Mac-
farlan, Mackrell, McDonald, McKenzie and
McLachlan represent the Macs.
Russell Clarke and his more forceful
younger brother Frank, President of the
Vic. Leg. Council, represent the third gen-
eration of Clarkes in the Chamber. Rus-
sell has been there 22 years and Frank 19.
The latter was a Minister before he became
President 15 years ago, but Russell never
rose above a Deputy-Chairmanship of Com-
mittees. Russell Clarke, though over mili-
tary age, enlisted in the A.1.F., and won a
commission on the other side. He is as
courteous as his late dad.
From Harold Sims, of Kamilaroi: —
In a letter on wool prices I wrote that John
Higgins was chairman and governing director of
the war-time Central Wool Committee. Of Bawra
he was all that; the committee, I now understand,
had no governing director. I regret that a temporary
confusion of the two bodies led me into error.

Reduction of interest on Commonwealth
securities,, including Treasury bills, and the
cnt of 1 p.c. in the charge for overdrafts
were responsible for about £60,000 of the
£68,203 by which declared net earnings tell
away last year. The rates paid on fixed
deposits were lowered to ease the pressure
there, but the reductions applied only to
new contracts; old ones run on to maturity
at the old rates. Also, there was a drop
of £5 p.c. in the charge for London money,
though any loss there may have been in this
respect was probably more than offset by
the gain when the rate rushed up to £lo(l p.c.
early in 1931. Still, the continued sag in
prices and lessened trade activity generally
meant lower earnings for the banks as well
as others ; while the precarious condition ot
many in the pastoral industry, especially in
the central-west, of Queensland and toward
the Gulf, where drought conditions prevail,
has not lessened the need to provide substan-
tially for contingencies, and taxation has
continued to mount.,
So from one cause and another, the
declared net result of the year’s _ opera-
tions dropped to 4.2 p.c. on capital as
against 8.1, 11.7, 12.1, 12.3, 13.6, 13.9, 15.7
and 16.1 p.c. back to 1924—the persistent
slip is partly the result of a flood of new
capital; the £950.000 gathered during the
half-dozen years to the close of accounts
in 1929 lifted the total to its present figure
(£1.750,000). So 21 points were chipped
off the div., reducing it to 4 p.c. Besides
substantial inner reserves, capital had the
visible support and assistance of £878,644
of surplus earnings at June 30, and there
is £3.091,669 of 34 p.c. perpetual deben-
tures. To pay the interest on these and
4 p.c. on the shares, total funds (capital,
reserves and debentures combined) need turn
in only 3.1 p.c. Still, the market, mindful
of the trend of interest rates and other
things, which have made the debentures less
profitable than of recent years, prices the
£5 paid shares at par as against £6 10s. a
couple of years ago. As for cover, the eye
could see £7 10s. 2d. per share in net tan-
gibles at June 30.
The outstanding feature of balance-sheet
figures is strength :

Thus last year’s contraction of £196,879
in deposits and of £144,929 in acceptances,
etc., was accompanied by a reduction of
£1,053,062 in advances and a growth of
£695,142 in liquids. Commonwealth Trea-
sury bills figure at £1,600,000, up £1,050,000
during the year; they can be discounted
at the Commonwealth Bank. When the
books last closed liquids amounted to 59.1
of the liabilities to the public, and. the bank
was holding only £1 9s. 6d. of outside money
for every £1 of its own funds, including the
debenture stock. It is an exceptionally
strong position, but it means low earning
power until profitable employment can be
found for more of the funds.
Excepting the droughty patch already
referred to, the immediate outlook is for
another good season in Queensland. But
prices in the primary industries, though they
have strengthened a trifle, are below last
year’s averages. Hopes are that the work
done at Lausanne and the possible outcome
of Ottawa will prove to be stepping stones
to a recovery in world prices, and therefore
to better conditions locally.

Unlike the big inter-State shipping cos.
these coastal concerns have been practically
unaffected by the slackness in inter-State
trade and the precarious condition of the
coal industry. For the 12 months covered
by tlie latest accounts another good season
on the N. S. Wales North Coast again
enabled farmers to fill this co.’s ships
with dairy and other produce. But prices
remained depressed, and lighter purchases
by storekeepers and others affected back-
loading, while more had to be paid out m
taxation. Also, the Tariff Board has not
yet settled the question of increased duty
on ships of over 100 tons purchased abroad.
Any increase would, of course, affect the
cost of replacements; a matter which is
being carefully watched, the chairman says.
So, after opeilly striking off approximately
one-tenth of the book value of the fleet as
it stood at the close of accounts in 1931,
the net result of last year’s trading was 8.1
p.c. on capital as against 8.6, 12, 11.1, 11. <
and 12 p.c. back to 1927, and a couple ol
points was knocked off the div., reducing it
to 8 p.c. The rate was lifted from 8 p.c.
to 9 p.c. in 1913, and to 10 p.c. in 1920, and
remained steady for the next 11 years. It
was sweetened with a small capitalisation
in 1926 —the only one in the co.’s history—
which makes 8 p.c. worth a wink under 9
p.c. on old holdings.
Owing to the co.’s snug position, the
downward trend of interest rates and the
better tone of the market generally, the
pound shares are now priced at 28s. 4d. as
against 255. a year ago. At the higher
figure the return is 5.6 p.c. on an 8 p.c.
div. basis, and the visible backing was
275. 2d. in net tangibles, of which a little
more than one half was surplus liquids. The
balance was represented mainly by shipping
property, which has been liberally written
down in the books out of earnings, and
liquids have benefited.
Here is the position as balance-sheet
figures show it: —
1926. 1930. 1931. 1932.
Paid capital. . £394,714 £443,700 £443,700 £443,700

Liquid .. 202,913 287,115 318,837 346,465
Thus at the close of last accounts the more
or less liquid surplus (£316,463) was
£28,485 stronger than at the previous
balance. Liquids consist of Consols, £159,472;
cash, mostly on deposit, £152,242; book
debts, stores, etc., £34,751. During the last
half-dozen years five old hulks were sold and
one was wrecked ; and two new motor vessels
were bought. The ships are reported in
good order and fully insured.

The clip was heavier, but total sales
(435,916 bales) by all Brisbane brokers
were 22,484 bales lighter for the _ 1931-32
season. This successful co-operative firm
received 116,431 bales (up 4097). Its sales
(122,557 bales) increased by 6446 bales, the
carry-over into the current term being 8347
bales. Fatstock turnover (142,293 head)
was down 34,054; and the Queensland aver-
age price for greasy was 7|d., as against
nearly lOd. in the previous season. Local
prices for beef, mutton and hides all fell
away about 20 p.c.; thus, notwithstanding
the larger volume of wool handled, total
turnover of the Q.P.P. slipped £165,577: —

For many years 40 p.c. rebates on wool
commissions and 30 p.c. on fat stock have
been allowed. The directors decided to carry
anything above the reduced div. (7 p.c.)
to reserves in respect of the past term Thus,
relieved of a substantial charge, net profits
(£19,649. after making “all necessary pro-
vision” for bad debts, depreciation and taxa-
tion) improved £1072. Though more capi-
tal was at work, owing to concessions to
borrowers, net interest earnings slipped £550.
Clients have done very well in the
past, and reserves can now do with
attention. It is just about 12 years
since the co. took over John Bridge s
Queensland business and started out to rope
in producers as shareholders. Out of profits
shareholders are entitled to the first 7 p.c.;
then clients begin to benefit. The business
forged ahead rapidly. By 1926 branches
had been opened at Rockhampton and Long-
reach ; next year activities spread to Char-
leville, and a further outpost was established
at Townsville last year.
Since 1926 the co. has put on £115.134
of new capital (now £229,773, up £l3 048
last term). Most of the now money and an
extra £lOO,OOO borrowed from outsiders went
into advances, up £201,364 over the five
vears to 1931: —

Last term £9197 was worked off the item
(£372.180) ; £21.588 was also sliced off the
outside debt (£264.835, including taxation
provision). In 1931, in order to cope with
business, a new wool-store was put up at
Bulimba; hence the growth of £43,405 in
the freeholds item that, term; last year
there was a net drop of £1525 in the book
value. Advances are nearly all in wool lines :
thus the financial position should give the
board little worry if accounts are carefully
watched.
Wool prices are still weak, and the out-
look for the grower remains far from bright.

For the 22 years to the close of accounts
in 1929 this solidly-established stock- and
station-agency and wool- and produce-brok-
ing concern paid divs. averaging 10.5 p.c.,
sweetened with 1235,000 of bonus scrip. Lite
gifts raised paid capital to. £290,000. But
prices collapsed, earnings shrank, the div.
has been reduced to 7i p.c.. and bestowal ot
gifts has ceased —and conditions will need
to improve vastly before it is likely to he
renewed.
In Sydney wool averaged £lO 10s. 3d. per
bale last season as against £ll 6s. 3d. for
the previous one and £2l 17s. 3d. in 1928-
29; and the fall in prices for cattle, sheep,
hides and produce has been almost as steep.
So, although the seasons were good and the
business held well, the co.’s gross earnings
from trading dropped from £103,338
for the 12 months to the close of accounts
in 1929 to £92,488 last year, when the slip
was £2350. Of this £2235 was offset by
savings in exes. (£79,963, including £12,000
set aside for taxation). Interest on fixed
deposits, etc., was £OOB lighter at £10,164
(=3.5 p.c. on capital), leaving net earnings
from all sources at 7.8 p.c. on capital as
against 8. 8.4. 20.9, 19.3 and 22.5 p.c. back
to 1927. Thus, after paying the div.. there
was visibly £939 to spare. At June 30 the
co. had £200,000 on fixed deposit. Over
the last 12 months interest rates have fallen
by 2 p.c. on three months’ and 1 j p.c. on
24 months’ currencies; so a shrinkage of
over £2OOO can be expected on last year’s
returns from deposits, etc. Whether the cur-
rent year’s net earnings will exceed 71 p.c.
on capital will depend largely upon the
maintenance of turnover, which in turn
depends upon the season and prices, and
upon the extent to which exes can be further
restrained.
However, the position is very snug. The
co. ' is fortunate enough to be able to
return two-thirds of its capital should the
necessity arise, and, of course, to take im-
mediate advantage of any trading opportu-
nity that offers. Here is the position as
balance-sheet figures disclose it: —

Liquid assets 50,000 141,250 202,625 221,844
Last year the overdraft (£22,972 at the
previous balance) was; wiped; out, £14,714
was added to the amount coming to sundry
creditors, the book value of advances was
reduced £26,010 and the cash holding was
strengthened by £19,219. Movement in the
figures, since 1925 suggests that advances have
been largely against wool and other readily
saleable products.
The market prices the pound shares at
335. as against 255. a year ago. The return
at the higher figure is 4.4 p.e. on a 7-« p.c.
div. basis. The backing is 275. 7d. in net
tangibles.

The poorness of the basket (there was not
enough to distribute) was due to the disap-
pearance of Ivandos Cement, in which this
co. holds about 100,000 shares, from the
dividend list. The co.’s own tile works at
Granville, which have apparently never
turned in much profit, were closed during
most of the 12 month's covered by the
latest accounts, 'and there was sufficient
stock on hand at June 30 to take- care of
demand for some months.
Ivandos, which was a steady 10 per center
with wide margins during the boom years,
paid 5 p.c. from profits equal to 5.2 p.c. on
its capital for the year to June 30. 1931,
and nothing at all during the succeeding 12
months. To eliminate wasteful competition
and overlapping, Kandos (N.S.W.) and Aus-
tralian Cement (Vic.) amalgamated at the
end of 1929, each receiving a million pa'ds
in Australian Portland Cement Pty., which'
took over both cos.’ working assets. Thus
the proprietary controls plant with an annual
capacity of over 400,000 tons, or about one-
third of the plant capacity of the Common-
wealth. But the works slowed down and
stocks accumulated as public loan money
gave out and slackness in the construction
and other trades reduced the demand for
cement. Australian, sales for 1931 were less
than 290,000 tons (about one-quarter of
plant capacity) as against 713.377 tons in
1927. Thus the industry is heavily overcapi-
talised, and the future bristles with diffi-
culties. All that can be said definitely is
that both Kandos and the Australian co.
are well equipped for a struggle, financially
and otherwise.

The co. used to be in the timber business,
but it got out in good time, and sold most
most of its old freeholds at liandsofne profits,

Paid capital is £270,099. Chief asset is
shares, debentures, etc., in the General
Film Co., which used to control Union
Theatfes (now in liquidation) and Austra-
lasian Films—the latter did the hiring. At
March 31 West’s interests in General Film
figured at £285,289; Greater Union, £4716:
Consols, cash and book debts, £31,649; free-
hold, £35,893. There was £4308 coming to
creditors) including £2300 reserved for taxa-
tion. Thus, the net book value of the under-
taking was £353,239. Last, year’s profit
came from interest and rents; no divs. wen-
received from General Film.
At tlie moment the whole group of Union
Theatres, which is a tangle of interlocking
share interests, is in process of reorgani-
sation and reconstruction. Originally West’s.
Spencer’s and Amalgamated all sold their
showing rights, etc.,, to the. General Film Co.
for scrip. General Film then formed Union
and Australasian Films to do the showing
and hiring respectively. Greater J. D. Wil-
liams came in, and took shares direct in
the two operating cos., each of which had
a paid capital of £300,000. Good progress
was made and satisfactory divs. were paid.
The success of the talkies brought richer
returns, swollen by scattered loan funds. An
expensive programme of development _ and
costly methods of conducting the business
followed, and Union lifted its capital to
£1,000,000 and went heavily into debt to
finance the outlay.. Then slump and special
taxation brought losses instead of profits,
and the outside debt (£824,864 .in the two
operating cos. combined at the end of .1930)
overshadowed .the whole position.
Union Theatres, Ltd., went into voluntary
.liquidation.toward the close of last year, and
the four holding cos. in which- the public is
interested . formed another group, chief of
which is Greater Union Theatres, Ltd., to
take over the assets. Greater Union’s
original paid capital was £18,000; it issued
another 70,000 in satisfaction of some of the
debts taken over, and put out a further
312,000 bonus shares to make capital equal
to the estimated net book value of the under-
taking. The £400,000 of capital thus arrived
at is held as follows: —■
Greater Uniox Theatres, Ltd.
Debt
Original Pay- Bonus
Capital, ments. Shares. Total.
Amalgamated . . £2,628 £10,220 £45,552 £58,400
Gtr. J. D. Williams 5,850 22,750 101,400 130,000
West’s .. .. 4,716 18,340 81,744 104,800
Spencer’s .. 4,806 18,690 83,304 106,800
£lB,OOO £70,000 £312,000 £400,000
Greater Union’s tender included an under-
taking to hand not. less than 20 p.c. of its
annual net takings to the liquidator until
the old co.’s trade creditors are paid in full.
Thus to pay a 5 p.c. div. Greater Union,
which is reported to be earning profits, "would
need to net about 74 p.c.
West’s proposes to distribute its holding
in Greater Union amongst its own share-
holders ; the proportion is approximately two
for five. This scrip will have to be substituted
for shares, debentures, etc., in the General
Film Co., the chairman says. What has
happened in connection with Australasian
Films has not been made clear; apparently
General Film’s holding in the Australasian
co. is no longer of any value. Thus on the
basis of figures at March 31 the not bo_ok
value of West’s assets would be £172,750.
The market prices the pound shares at 95.;
thus valuing the undertaking at £121,504.

The co. depends largely upon Government
contracts; thus, since the supply of public-
loan funds ran out, it has been difficult to
find enough work to' keep the factory at
Lane Cove (N.S.W.) and the other one at
Footscray (Vic.) going at half their capa-
city. Industrial legislation in N. S. Males
was a further handicap. After paying all
exes, and keeping the plant-in good running
order, there was not enough to pass rouno
amongst shareholders in 1931. But the
wood pipe has its special advantages, and
thus far its own particular market; so, de-
spite difficulties, business improved a trifle
last year, when enough remained to show
1.8 p.c. on capital, and a 2| p.c. div. was
paid, reducing reserves to £5215 in excess of
the £B2OO at which rights, etc., appear. Over
the last decade divs. have averaged 5.4 p.c.

CARE-FREE
TRAVEL
THE TRUE PLEASURE
of journeying away from home cannot be experienced
unless cares and troubles are dissociated from it. Many
little difficulties can arise when a traveller is far from home,
but most of them can be provided for in advance by obtain-
ing advice and assistance from those who have studied
travel problems and arranged an organisation covering all
important contingencies.
The National Bank has, for many years, provided adequate
financial facilities for travellers, both within Australia and
away from these shores. More recently, it widened its
service by establishing Travel Service Departments at its
Head Office in Melbourne and at its principal offices in
Sydney and Brisbane. These are closely linked up with
its branch at Australia House, the Strand, London, which
was specially established for the convenience of the Bank s
customers and friends travelling abroad.
A full range of information with regard to routes, fares,
accommodation, time-tables, foreign currencies, passport
and taxation requirements, is available either direct or
through any of the Bank’s numerous branches. Money
transfers and Letters of Credit arranged to meet travellers’
needs in all parts of the world.
This service is only one of the many facilities which the
Bank has made available for the use of its customers and
friends.

“I don’t have to worry about
things; the A.M.P. sees to that.”
“I’m reaping the benefits of having been an early believer in
the A.M.P.,” said a certain old builder recently.
“When I had savings to put by I put ’em into A.M.P.
policies that would mature when I was sixty. When I got
to sixty there was enough to retire on, and here I am. I can
sit in the sun and read the paper of a morning, or play with
the grandchildren, or go and have a yarn with the other old
boys at the Bowling Green. Old age is pleasant when you
have health and a steady income. I don’t have to worry
about things; the A.M.P. sees to that!’’
Men and women who want to eliminate anxiety about their old
age should send for the Society’s booklets telling how the
A.M.P. (the largest mutual life office in the Empire) “sees to
that.” It is astonishing how little it costs to be adequately
insured.
Full particulars will be Sent gladly to any enquirer anywhere.
The A.M.P. is purely Mutual. All surplus is returned to
members annually in the form of bonuses.

Thus during the last three years £29,322

sundry creditors, stocks and debtors’ balances
being reduced by £I9,SSS and £11,869 re-
spectively for the purpose. When the books
last closed the more or less liquid surplus
(£36,704, including stocks) was £1454 better
than at the previous balance. Much de-
pends upon whether the amount spent on
plant, etc., and charged against revenue
proves to be sufficient to cover actual wear
and tear.
The current year promises to be more pro-
fitable than the one covered by the last
accounts. There is £30,000 worth of con-
tracts iu hand, which will be completed by
the end of December, and the board has
tendered for a number of large schemes for
which money has been made available.
On the market the pound shares are
priced at 10s. They are covered by net
tangibles with a book value of 215., mostly
plant, etc., worth what it can earn.
Vale of Clwydd Coal and Brick Co., one-
time the steadiest div.-payer in the Western
N.S.W. coalfield’s group, has issued another
dry balance-sheet. Both old and new col-
lieries have been idle all the half-year, and
the brickworks are dead. There are bank
advances and other debts amounting to
£52,787, most of them incurred in getting
No. 2 colliery ready (it stands in the sheet
at £134,023), and between interest and odd
exes, the co. went back another £5318 during
the six months. Efforts to raise more capital
are still in cold storage.

“Marmatite”: “Jackhamer’s” reference to
rock drills and drill steel (B. 13/7/’32)
calls for comment from Broken Hill, where
there has been considerable investigation
along those lines. There are five types of
hammer drills, all using hollow steel, in use
at the Barrier. Piston drills were discarded
after the 1919 strike. Most mining fields
present particular problems. Conditions on
the Rand and at the Broken Hill mines are
totally dissimilar. On the Rand, narrow,
flatly inclined lodes predominate, and the
hand-held machine is most suitable; at
Broken Hill, with wide lodes, the mounted
machine, of two sizes, best meets the con-
ditions. The following figures, from the
annual reports of B. H. South, show the
advances due, among other factors, to im-
provement in drilling-machines and drill-
steel treatment: —
Tons p.a. per
Under-
Hour Com- ground
per Type of parative Em- Mining Cost

1927.. 35 Air Drill Decreasing 543 265. Id.
1931.. 35 Air Drill Minimum 595 18s. 6.3 d.
Mining costs have been also largely affected
by wages, including the lead bonus, and the
cost of stores, etc., of course.
During the month of June Ml. Isa mined
50,947 tons of ore and milled 49,039 tons for
8406 tons of concentrates. The silver-lead
bullion produced was 3940 tons. In point
of quantity this is the best monthly per-
formance to date, but a comparison of the
April, May and June figures reveals a steady
drop in the grade of the ore:—
April. May. June.
Ore milled, tons .. 39,422 42,794 49,039
Assay—Lead.. .. 11.1 p.c. 10.8 p.c. 9.9 p.c.
With metal prices as they are the drop in
the grade of the ore represents a decrease in
revenue of about £65,000 per annum. The
mill recoveries for .the month were 75.6 p.c.
of the lead and 66 p.c. of the silver. A loss
of 25 p.c. of the lead and 34 p.c. of the silver,
combined with the low price of metals, must
be very discomforting to the management,
which is putting up a great fight. Possibly
it finds such a recovery more economic than
something which looks more impressive on
paper. The chief object of silver-lead pro-
ducers . to-day, like that of the woolgrower,
is to reduce losses by hook or by crook.
* * , * =!=
The gold premium and the remarkable
advances made in selective flotation give Mt.
Morgan a good chance. There is a handy
block of ore worth 6|dwt. gold and 1 p.c.
copper, and that means 50s. at present prices.
Since 1927, when flotation was tried on
Morgan ore, such an improvement has been,
made with the process that whereas then
100 tons could be concentrated to 251 tons,
to-day it can be brought down to 6 tons.
R. W. Lennon, who used to be on the Zinc
Corporation staff and afterwards was in
charge of the Burma Corporation’s mill, goes
to Morgan as metallurgist. Besides the
70,000 tons of ore almost immediately avail-
able, there are something like eight million
tons of other grades; lvow much of it is
payable only further research can, prove.
Some exceedingly rich assays and small
crushings of picked stone are mainly respon-
sible for the Cracow (Q.) boom. Although
a ton has been crushed for lOOoz. of gold,
and several other parcels for lOoz. to 300 z.,
these are drops in the ocean of white low-
grade quartz that is so abundant on the field
The shoots are unquestionably of very high
grade; but it is known that some of them
are very limited in dimensions, and very
scattered. Until something is known of the
probable size and frequency of these shoots,
the sensational prices hid recently for
Cracow cos.’ scrip are not'warranted.

Mt. Wandoo (N.Q.) lias never had 50 men
employed. About half a dozen lias been the
number lately. xVlex. Macdonald, who w r cnt
to Britain in May to secure further capital,
and is due in Australia again any day now,
has been successful in' his mission. Rumors
in the North are that he has £50,000. but
some of it may be earmarked for Cardross,
an old love of bis, and for King Yol. The
time, however, seems inopportune for any-
thing but gold or auriferous base metals.
Labor is looking forward to the spending of
the Macdonald thousands at Wandoo. On
the surrounding leases some new discoveries
have been made, showing that rich veins
are not confined to the Macdonald. leases.
C. C. Boulter has struck a vein that gives
prospects for ounces on the north side oi
Mt. Wandoo. and his ground may prove to be
equal to the best there. Most other prospectors
are loaming. with indifferent success, so far.
According to the geological reports the field
has possibilities; the high values are con-
fined to thin veins, which means much
development.

New Misima G. M. Co., Papua, is yielding
its owners handsome returns. Steady is.
divs. are being distributed monthly and there
are large quantities of payable ore m sight.
About 1400 tons a month are bei«g treated.
The syndicate which first sent G. O. Wilkin-
son there to try cyaniding the setter _oie
without preliminary crushing has received
about 255. for every £1 it invested What
puzzles those most intimately connected
the venture is why St. Aignans an( | then
Block 10, which took over from the former
co. made such a failure of a show that has
paid ever since. All the gold is won by
cyaniding. Mining and treatment costs are
about 17s. a ton, and the lode being worked
is up to 40ft. wide.

New Guinea Goldfields is getting on with
its treatment mill, which is to begin opera-
tions early next month. When in full swing
it. is expected to add £200,000 p.a., Australian
currency, to net profits. The alluvial con-
tinues to give good results. The operating
profit for May was £9584 (Australian)
from 31150 z. of bullion. June’s production
was 33960 z, bullion.

The North Mt. Farrel, at Tullah (Tas.),
was to have closed early this month, but
agreement has been reached between the
miners and the trustees of the late Frank
Bond, who owned the mine, and work will
now be continued. WithNead at its present
price the loss has been stated at £lOO per
week. The lode is narrow and the water
heavy, which mean high mining costs';
At Sons of Gwalia, Leonora (W.A.), on
No. 25 level, inclined depth 3849 ft., a winze
has been sunk 132 ft. in ore averaging lOdwt.
per ton over a width of sft. On the level
below, a drive from a winze disclosed similar
grade stone over a length of 65ft. and a
width of Bft. The Gwalia is one of the few
mines that have improved with depth. Con-
ditions generally do not indicate any likely
alteration in the dimensions of the lode. In
June the co. treated 12,154 tons of ore and
sand for a gross return of £14,522, and a
profit of £7OOO, including £9,200 for exchange.
*
After deduction of £1720 brought for-
ward, Associated Northern (W.A.) balanced
£4545 short of the mark last year. In
November last the co.’s mines at Kalgoorlie
and Ora Banda were offered, but no bids
were received. They are still on the market.
The El Rejugio goldmine, Mexico, has been
abandoned, and the co.’s holding in Lorrain
silver-mines, Canada, valued at £4996 in the
books, has been written off. Cash assets are
equal to about. Is. 4Ad. per share.

In 1931 Great Boulder Prop. (W.A.)
crushed 97,789 tons for 79,5470 z. of gold,
yielding a net profit of £35,971 as against
£4847 in 1930, and a 6d. div. was paid on
the 1,750,000 2s. shares. Recent develop-
ments sent the scrip from 2s. 6d. to 9s. on
the market.

At North Kalgux-li, on the 122 ft. level, the
oxidised ore in a 30ft. drive south from Gene-
vieve shaft averaged 18dwt. over a width of

20dwt. stuff occurs for 55ft. over a width
7-|ft., while down at the 700 ft. 17dwt. stone
is being stoped.

Another bit of Eureka’s small but very
rich shoot of gold at Lake Austin (W.A.)
has just yielded 11920 z. from slightly over
35 tons. Several large cakes of gold have
been obtained from this show of recent
years.
Nokomai Gold, Central Otago (M.L.),
reports a second clean-up of 1070 z., making
a total of 2690 z. from a paddock containing
21,000 c.y. of shallow alluvial. This is equal
to Is. id. per cubic yard, wdth gold at
£4 4s. A dragline excavator, electrically
driven, is to be installed, and will be in
operation by December next. The lift from
the bed of the creek is 90ft.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
What is meant by a no-liability co.? —935.
A company formed on the principle that
there is no contract between it and its
members in respect of calls on their shares or
contributions towards the discharge of debts
and liabilities of the co. If a call is made
it is optional for the member to pay it, but
failure to do so would result in automatic
forfeiture of his shares. The principle is
now restricted to mining ventures.
(1) Present price of molybdenite? (2)
Will it hold? (3) Uses of the metal? (4)
Chief consumers? (5) Cause of recent rise
in price?- —995.
(i) £1 Bs. 3d. per unit of molybdenite,
London. (2) Unlikely. American (U.S.A.)
operators have large reserves of ore; more
than sufficient to supply market require-
ments for many years to come. (3) Impart-
ing toughness to steel at high speeds and
temperatures. Compounds are used as color-
ing agents in porcelain ware, also in chemical
investigations. (4) Steel manufacturers of
Europe and America. (5) Probably due to
previous heavy selling from American
sources. In July-October, 1931, mice touched
295. per unit; towards end of November it
rose to 38s. per unit. Prior to the fall
mentioned, the figure had held around 325.
6d. per unit. Prices quoted are largely
nominal, there having been no great demand
for molybdenite for some time past.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
K.J.B.McD.: At June 30, 1931, Associated
Dominion’s assurance funds totalled £153,016; net
tangibles bad a book value of £92,923. Assuming
that the assurance funds exactly stated the liabilities
under policies, net tangibles were £60,093 short
of the mark. Under existing conditions co. will
have a difficult struggle to make up leeway....
M.J.8.: See B. 15/7/’3l and B. 29/6/’32 L.R.W.:
Under the Companies Act, shares are deemed -to
have been issued and to be held subject to the
payment of the whole amount thereof in cash. Hold
tight to your receipts. Address given in prospectus
was 252 George-street, Brisbane. Secretary, W. H.
80den....F.G.J.: (1) Hold on; the co. is in a
strong position financially. Stocks were the trouble
last year. (2) Co. may have a struggle to keep up
regular payments to prefs. for a while; hence
scrip likely to remain at a discount for some time.
(3) Shareholders appear to be in for lean time;
the debt stands in the way for one thing. Unable
to say when market for scrip will strengthen....
K.: (1) and (2) Yes. (3) The debt stands in
the way of an early return to dividend list, and
freeholds are overvalued in books. Outlook obscure.
....J.V.: (1) The Secretary, Stock Exchange, Pitt-
street, Sydney. (2) Yes. Talk the matter over
with your broker. (3) It all depends upon the
circumstances at the moment, and the collateral
offered.... S.C.: Both appear to be fully priced;
Lake View, for preference... .F.O’L.: Information
not available. .. .D.M.: For January quarter of 192!)
the weighted average retail price index-number for
the six capital cities of the Commonwealth was
823 ; for 1929 it was 1054; thus fall is 21.9 p.e.
From July, 1914, to March, .1933, Queensland index

Exchange and Secondary Industries
Several correspondents want to know
what the effect of a higher rate of exchange
would_be on the secondary industries. Much
depends on circumstances. Generally a high
rate is equivalent to on added Customs duty
’.mports. At present 25 p.c. can be; added
to the tariff on all goods from sterling coun-
J 40) Pf • on all goods from America,
i lance and other gold countries. Many
industries are more or less dependent oil
mpoited raw material and the exchange
imposes the same import tax on goods in
that class as on manufactured articles. This

ut in the long run, as the community has to pay
the exchange premium, whatever it is, costs will
go up, and any advantage is wiped out.
Tq the extent that it is inflation (and every
depreciation of currency is inflation) a high
exchange rate is to the advantage of the
borrower and the debtor, whether he is a
primary or a secondary producer.
Tobacco Sales
The tobacco-growers are facing a question
which the S African woolgrowers have been
debating for years. The Australian wool-
sales are so well known that they arc
accepted as the natural way of getting rid of
the clip; but the S’African growers still
prefer to sell by private treaty, just as our
own wheatgrowers do. A tobacco auction
was held in Melbourne some weeks ago, and
sellers were pretty generally disappointed,
those from Pomonal, alongside the Gram-
pians, are, however, not sure which plan is
the better, and want more experience of
private sales before coming to a conclusion
A agga (N.S.W.) announced an auction the
other day, and had the same experience as
several places that have tried local wool
sales—buyers wouldn’t attend. Only one
turned up at Wagga. The B.A.T. Co. takes
fSK* nn d ? U ? thers only about
1,000,0001 b. That fact is liable to severely
handicap scattered auctions; for if there is
nothing -specially attractive at a small sale
the -little buyers are likely to cut it out. ’
The Advantages of Education
‘Brady’s Look-out”: Joe the pedlar sat
smoking his pipe by the tire. Somebody was
reading a newspaper account of the trials
at the Criminal Court. Housebreaking was
pretty bad and the Judges had been handing
out stiff sentences. “Wisht I could read,”
Joe said. “A man’s got a chanst if ’e can
read e can keep out of gaol.” “How do
you make that out, Joe?” one of the chaps
asked. Easy,” Joe replied. “Look at me.
I pinched ’arf a dozen suits from a dyer,
and planted ’em back of a woodyard till the
noise died down. Twelve munce I kep’ 'em.
and then started ’awkin’ ’em round. Good
stuff they was and went off like ’ot. cakes.
All but the last one—wisht I’d never seen
it. One day I seen a toffy bloke waterin’
is garden. ’E ’ad 'is coat off and a ’ose in
is and, and I knew in a jiffy that suit
would fit: im like ’e’d been measured for it.
1 bowls up and speaks me piece and opens
me bag. ‘Fit you, sir,’ I says, ‘like a glove ’
It was a bonser grey suit, and no mistake.
‘Lets ’ave a look at it,’ says ’e. ’E ’eld the
coat up across ’is chest as if ’e was measurin’
it Then ’e turns the collar up. There was
a bit of tape there, I knew, with some sort
of wntin’ on it. ‘l’ll take it,’ ’e says, ‘and
you too.’ And ’e grabs me before I could
get a move on. It was a beautiful suit and
1 never see it again. Six munce they gimme
and all because ’e could read and I
couldn’t. ’ls name was on the collar.”
The High Price of Sugar
“E.G.”: One of the causes of the high price
of sugar is the assignment system. If you
want to sell beer you must buy out a man
who has a license; if you want to grow and
sell cane you must buy a farm with an
assignment on it. In both cases you pay
through the nose and then take it out of
the consumer.
Since a mill has a limited output, each
established grower has been assigned a cer-
tain acreage on his farm, from which all
cane produced will be taken by the mill. If
a new man wants to get into sugar-growing,
he can buy first-class land quite cheaply and
can grow cane, but no mill will crush it —
he has no assignment. The only course is
to buy a farm which has an assignment on
it, and for this he pays somewhere about ten
times as much as for virgin land. The
growers say that only a bare living is pos-
sible at the present prices of sugar, and they
are probably quite right as regards the meii
who have bought in recently. They may
not be making much for
themselves, but they are
making quite a lot for
the succession of owners
of the farm.
The Cure seems to be
to make’ assignments not
transferable and to ballot
for any assignment that
is forfeited by. the sale
of a fayrn. If this were
done fancy prices would
not be paid.
There is now talk of
organising the tobacco-
growers on the same
“sound” lines. Help!
Lined Wool Packs
“Dead Finish”: The
pastoral industry hears
little from Bradford these
days about vegetable mat-
ter in the wool clip and
the necessity of baling in
something else than jute
packs. Three or four
years ago Campbell Mur-
ray, of Moselle station,
Richmond (N.-W.Q.), de-
cided to test the matter
and see if an enhanced
price would result from
the use of paper-lined
packs. His packs came
from Dundee, and were
anything but bonnie to
handle, being made of a
stout sort of hessian,
with the paper lining.
(The price was bonnie for
Dundee, though.) The
AAA fleece w’ool from a
picked line of four-tooth
wethers was used, and
each alternate bale was
a paper-lined pack, the
one in between being the
ordinary jute. This-was
done to ensure that the
quality was uniform. The
wool was sold in London,
and the result was re-
markable—a half-penny a
pound difference in price.
But it was in favor of
the ordinary jute packs!
Farmers’ Expenses
The “N.Z. Year-Book”
has a statement showing
the distribution of expen-
diture on 261 farms in
the Dominion. Interest
and rent actually paid,
rates and taxes and com-
mission and insurance
account for 45 p.c. of the
outgoings; wages (in-
cluding apparently living-
expenses), 25 p.c.: cart-
age and railage, 2.9 p.c.:
manures and seeds* 10.4
p.c.; electric fight and
power. 1 p.c. That leaves
only 15.7 p.c. for machin-
ery, machinery repairs,
materials for repair of
fences and buildings,
stock medicines and foods
and all other things
which might conceivably
be subject to Customs
tariff charges. A small
part of the interest: or
rent may also be on
account of money spent
on fences or buildings .
partly of material liable
to Customs charges. But
even allowing for this, it is obvious that
the tariff touches a much smaller part of a
farmer’s outgoings than is generally sup-
posed—in Maoriland, at any rate.
The A.M.P. had £350,000 tucked away in
those British loans carrying 5 p.c. which the
Government invites the holders to convert
to stock carrying 31 p.c. The Board
promptly agreed to convert, desiring to ‘‘co-
operate with the British Government in its
determined effort to rehabilitate Britain and
the Empire,” But with the new era of
cheap money, policy-holders (and not, of
course, of this society only) will have to
realise that the bonuses paid during the
past few years will be impossible.

There was a time when the pubs were
the richest mines at Broken Hill; but many
of them have been delicensed on the appli-
cation of their owners, and what they are
worth then isn’t nice for other owners to
think about. One, the Crown and Anchor,
valued by the City Council at £2lOO, was
sold for £200: another, the Crystal, one of
the town’s oldest, valued at £1750, brought
£200; the Miners’ Arms, valued at £l5OO,
brought £3OO. But they are the aristocrats.
The Highest bid for the Cable was £120;
*“C owner refused it, and later sold it for

This season the Speck has topped all pre-
vious records by shipping 3,415,716 bushels of
apples and pears overseas. Southern orchards
contributed over 2,980,000 of this total.
Forty-nine steamers—some of which came
from the U.K. in ballast—lifted the car-
goes; the Natia taking the biggest lot
175,922 cases. The total Tasmanian crop
for export is estimated at 4,900,000 bushels
of apples and 165,000 bushels of pears. The
mainland took over a million and a half cases.

A member of various N.S.W. conciliation
committees controlling State awards writes,
apropos “Our Little Ncros” (B. 29/6/’32),
that not all of them receive fees. “A great
number of busy men,” he says, “give their
time and the benefit of their experience,
often fruitlessly, and get no consideration
whatever and very little thanks."
“Arradni”: Forced to “roll my own,” I

Reference was made in the Insurance Sup-
plement last week to the growth of Invest-
ment Trusts during the past few years, the
investor’s object being to spread his risks
more than he could possibly do by indi-
vidual purchases. Prior to 1922 only 18
of these trusts existed in the U.S.A. • and
their capital funds were 253 million dollars.
In 1929 alone 173 trusts were organised
with a capital of 3021 million dollars; and
at the end of that year 484 were in existence
with total capital funds of 5303 million
dollars. Since then, of course, few new
trust cos. have appeared; and there haa
been a shocking depreciation of assets—they
had lost 11 p.c. of book values in the first
quarter of 1930.

The Australian “10-cent chain store” is
having much the same experience as its
American parent: for 1931, while 27 Ameri-
can department stores showed a return of
0.7 p.c. as against 5.7 p.c. in 1930 and 10.5
p.c. m 1929, 43 chain stores showed 12 7
p.c. for 1931, 12.9 p.c. for 1930 and 19.3
p.c. for 1929. A striking feature of U.S A
chain-store experience last year was that the
most pretentious—like Woolworth’s—paid
less well than the average. In Australia the
limited-price stores are said to be more than
maintaining their turnover. Woolworth's,
which commenced operations in Sydney has
now taken a 21-year lease of the old
Britannia Theatre in Bourke-street, Mel-
bourne, and has a big building programme
in view.

The great attraction of Shakspeare, as of
Chopin, to his interpreters is that they can
make him subtle or robust, profound
or platitudinous, realistic or romantic,
a hedonist or a candidate for the Methodist
ministry. The only “Macbeth” with which
most Melbourne theatregoers were in a posi-
tion to compare the Casson-Thbrndike pro-
duction at the King’s was Allan Wilkies.
After a careful perusal of the play Mr.
Wilkie, being short of a first-class leading
lady, came to the conclusion that Macbeth
was the most important character, and that
his lady ranked second. After her perusal
Dame Thorndike reversed the order of pre-
ference. Statistically, the verdict is all
against Dame Sybil. Out of a total of 2500
lines, the Bard apportioned 700 to Macbeth
and a bare 250 to liis consort—a remarkably
terse woman Nevertheless, with these „o 0
lines Dame Thorndike succeeded on Satur-
day in transferring the interest of the drama
to herself and yet preserving its balance in
the new position. The Macbeth of Louis
Casson was only notable in places and then
usually when the presence of his lady .gave
him significance. Dor the rest he spoke his
lines correctly, but withoutovermuch con-
viction. But Dame Sybil was the (deadly
driving force behind-thfc action, whether:she
was on stage or off. As the socially-ambitious
female-is common to all ages, what'she did
can be expressed in modern Melbourne, terms
by saying that ,Mrs. Macbeth wanted to
swing high, in Toorak and .give. swell dinners
to her enemies and fake the chair at ■ unem-
ployed-relief committee meetings and be. seen
at grand opera first'nights, however boring,
and be mentioned as wearing a different dress
10 times a' week and as patronising
musicians she hated and artists she didn’t
understand. She wanted, in short, to make-
a bigger hit than Mrs. Smith, her next-door
neighbor; but she was cursed with a
duffer of a husband who had the mis-
fortune to be more inclined to honesty
than roguery, loyalty than deception,
thinking about things than doing them, bo
she worried the poor chap to blazes until m
desperation he went on the Stock Exchange,
and, after losing all his old friends and mak-
ing no new ones and ruining a lot of people,
some of them perfectly innocent, he landed
a fortune. But no sooner had he landed it
than he began to lose it, and then he got a
bad conscience (known as witches in ancient
Scotland), nerves and indigestion. Pre-
sently at one of his wife’s dinners
he became hysterical and swore that
he could see the ghost of a man
whom he liad driven into bankruptcy
and suicide sitting in his place at the
table. And he got so bad that his wife s
maternal instinct w T as aroused and she was
quite sorry for the poor fellow and did her
best to protect him, for he had become quite
helpless and childish. (In this scene Dame
Sybil touched great depths of sympathetic
understanding). But he was too' far gone,
and from being dishonest carefully he became
dishonest carelessly and got into prison. And
Mrs. Macbeth, now Lady Macbeth, being
childless and having nothing left to live for,
took an overdose of morphia. And instead
of getting into Johns’s “Who’s Who in Aus-
tralia,” Macbeth got into the records of Pen-
tridge as “Prisoner No. 185674, consistent
good conduct.”
The generally fine production was staged
with all the ornateness of a Royal Academy
picture. Atholl Fleming, as Macduff, was
poignant in the scene where he learnt of the
murder of his family. The only thing le.ft
for a conscientious critic to cavil at was the
sub-editing of the devil-porter’s dialogue. A
producer of Louis Casson’s eminence should
have more courage than to destroy the unity
of the character by excising some of his most
significant lines in deference to the supposed
squeamishness of a modern audience. It
was not so much like putting a figleaf on
the Venus de Medici as trousers on a zoo
elephant.

Opera at Melb. Royal is full of surprises.
You arrive at the theatre in your best
clothes. The Taits have installed a spruiker
at the front door. Ominous sign! First
spruiker in the history of the Firm. But
they must get people into their theatres
somehow. This is the third year of the
Great Depression. The country is financially
lying on its back. That is the only sense in
which business can be said to be looking up.
Times are too serious for frivolous pursuits.
The show is “Rigoletto.” Written in 1851
and played ever since. The people want some-
thing fresh. The house, of course, will be as
empty as the smile of a haberdasher’s assist-
ant. ’ Wrong. It is packed to the ceiling
beams. You take your place, stuffing your
coat, hat and scarf under the seat to save
cloakroom fees. The lights go out, the
overture swells. It whimpers, it raves, it
curses and it groans. It tells you of the
profligate Duke of Mantua, handsome and
devil-may-care, and of his pander, Rigoletto,
the deformed jester; of the blood-curdling
curse of Count Monterone, whose daughter
has been one of Rigoletto’s victims. Rigoletto’s
wickedness will be a boomerang recoiling on
himself. Then the music changes its tone. It
tells of Rigoletto’s daughter Gilda, chaste and
beautiful as a morning in spring, how the
Duke lusteth 'after her, how Rigoletto, all
unknowing and pursued by Monterone’s
curse, assists the Duke to obtain his desire.
The music changes again. It relates how
Rigoletto swears that a terrible vengeance
shall fall upon the Duke, how the assassin
Sparafueile is hired to murder the villain
and put his bodv in a bag, how Spara, etc.,
kills the beauteous Gilda instead. The
music screams, trumpets, thunders and
brays. It weeps. Achingly. Crash! The
jester lias fallen senseless across the dead
body of the girl. The curtain goes up.
The magical power of music has fixed an
image of Gilda indelibly in your mind. You
wait , for, .the\ first, scene ,to 5 with ill-
concealed impatience because she does hot
appear in it. She arrives in the middle of
the second scene. A Venus de Milo and a
Mona Lisa rolled into one? Wrong. Lina
Paliughi Gilda, saving her presence, looks
like a dear little fluffy penguin astounded
beyond words to find herself gazing across
the footlights at some of the very best people
from Toorak instead of standing on an ice
floe watching the baby whales. Do penguins
sing ? A voice as sweetly penetrating, as
penetratingly sweet, as frangipanni, as cloy-
ing as a tropic night, as agile as a steeple-
jack flows over your consciousness. Can pen-
guins feel? The voice throbs with passion
and entreaty and moans in despair. Its
owner, smites her chest, the ample residence
of all the muses of song. She wrings her
little hands. She bows her small, childlike
head in prayer. You are enchanted. You
forget for the nonce that, the man sitting in
front of you has a disagreeably fat red neck,
and is probably a depression millionaire
profiteering in foreign exchange. Your tie,
disregarded, climbs under your left ear.
Your sense of the ridiculous is dismayed,
annihilated. It crawls shamefacedly under
the seat after your coat and hat. Hunch-
back Rigoletto totters on, designing to speak
to his daughter, but is instantly recognised,
despite his disguise, as the popular Signor
Apollo Granforte, of the Milan Grand Opera
House. No good his pretending he isn’t.
The audience knows better and calls his
bluff. He gives up the attempt to deceive
it, comes to the footlights and bows 17 times.
Then he remembers that he is paid by
J.C.W. to attend to another job. He goes
up to the penguin and clutches her head.
He clasps her waist, kisses her distracted
haqds, . blubbers without restraint upon the
residence of all the - muses of song. Rigo-
letto Granforte is telling the penguin to
“piangere”—-that means to weep, doesn’t it?
He tells her 1 to weep "999 times. She weeps.
What penguin wouldn’t, when ask d to do so
in a’ voice of such glorious golden power?

They are singing the world-famous quartet
in the last act. The various passions of
four personages separated by a wall are
contrasted and combined with consummate
art. Behind them .the lightning flashes and
the thunder rolls. You can scarcely see
Gilda. but your ears assure you that she
is holding her own. They finish. Thunder
breaks out in front and the thunder behind
obligingly stops. The four passions stand
and look at each other as if confused. Still
the thunder rolls in front. The conductor
raises his hand. The thunder in front
stops. The various passions of four per-
sonages separated by a wall are once more
combined and contrasted with constummate art
while the lightning flashes and the thunder
rolls obligingly again. Gilda is stabbed.
She dies. Rigoletto faints. The curtain
comes down. Somnambulistically you gather
up your coat, hat and scarf and make for
the street. Your sense of the ridiculous,
curse it> can find its own way home.

“Carmen” burst with a bang into the
grand-opera parade at Melbourne Royal on
Saturday. As the Spanish nymphomaniac
Bruna Castagna made a profound impres-
sion, especially upon a member of the com-
pany off duty who was seated near this
Showman, and signified approval by making
a noise suggestive of two boards being
banged together. Apollo Granforte Esca-
milla appeared to sing as easily as an ordi-
nary person breathes. C. Genoni’s Michaela.
both in voice and appearance, was a mild
reproof to her passionate surroundings.
Houses continue to range from packed to

There is a popular opinion that the stan-
dard of music in Melbourne is higher than
in Sydney. This view is more firmly held
in Melbourne than in Sydney, wlncu pro-
bably explains why the series of recitals a
the Assembly Hall, Melbourne, given by
George White, Robert Miller, William Ivras-
nik and Osric Fyfe, comprising the byoney
String Quartet, was poorly patronised.
Those who attended heard four young men
play with remarkable precision and consider-
able subtlety, the outstanding item m one pro-
gramme being Beethoven’s Op. 59 concerto
and of another the Dvorak quintet, Op. 01.
Osric Fyfe’s performance on tlie ’cello was
noteworthy.
Sydney Rep. Soc.’s little theatre was full
of chortles on Saturday night, when Lynn
Starling’s three-act farce, “ ’Phone for the
Doctor,” was performed. Scott Alexander
sat back and let his wife produce this play.
Acting honors were shared by Alice Bolger
and William Rees. The plot is Enoch
Arden mixed up with the ’Frisco earthquake,
and the situations are cleverly amusing, lo
be repeated to-night.

For its third play of the year— there are
five one-aeter evenings as well —Adelaide
Repertory gave Noel Coward’s “Young
Idea.” It is far from being his best work,
but its witty frivolities cheered and were
cheered by three big houses. Jack Fox and
Minnie Baker as the reckless young people
(borrowed from Shaw) had most of the
work, and were specially good at the crisis
where they drive their stepmother to elope-
ment by dramatically pleading with her not
to go: Mimi’Martin was sound as the pas-
sionate wife, and Etlielwyn. Robin as the
philosophical one; Wallace Johnstone, who
is always reliable, was the much-tried hus-
band and father. Ray Walsh “produced.’

•At Adelaide Royal Cyril Ritchard and
Cecil Kelleway l romped through the sultry
fun —French, complete' with love-perfume,
undress, etc. —which N’York has given a
golfing flavor and called “Follow Through.”
Madge Elliott is as graceful as ever, and
Dulcie Davenport shows promise. Frank
Neil is just coming in at this house, with
Ella Shields and a mixed co.
The Palette.
In Hans Heysen’s show of flower studies
in oils, landscapes in water-color and 27
charcoal drawings at the Grosvenor Gal-
leries, Sydney, the oils and the water-colors
tell nothing much that is new either about
their subjects or their painter. But the
charcoals do. In these crisply-drawn
sketches is revealed a vastly more sensitive
and versatile artist than the Heysen of the
eucalypts and the zinnias. Each of the 27
studies looks like a finely-engraved etching.
There’s nothing niggling about the charcoal
lines, but the draughtsmanship is so abso-
lutely accurate, the composition and the
allocation of light-values so rightly balanced
that an impression of rich completeness is
created. It’s a hard thing to suggest a
frost in a sunlit landscape in monochrome,
but Heysen does it so successfully in “The
Road. Frosty Morning” that the title is
tautology. The horses, the men, the turkeys
and, of course, the trees in these rural
scenes bear the stamp of authenticity. There
probably isn’t veritably much of an appear-
ance of romance about certain old Hobart
mansions that the artist has depicted, but
the magic charcoal has imbued them with
interest.
Water-colorist M. J. McNally, who has a
show at Macquarie Galleries, Sydney, has
taken to golf and fishing and attend-
ing fights at the. Stadium instead of
' looking at the sky and finding land-
scapes to suit it’s moods. The result
isn’t very satisfactory. The color in the
golfing and fishing sketches is either a bit
garish or a bit muddy, and golfers, fisher-
men and boxers are represented by what
look like algebraic symbols—y’s and xs.
“Whitby (Cliffs, Cronulla,” is a pleasing
essay in the painter’s old style. The best
thing in the show, by miles and miles, is
a very small, very simply composed study
in oils; “Sunlight”—a very fine impression.
John Longstaff has done more vigorous
work than his portrait of Miss Aileen Mcln-
erney, which suggests a flagging interest in
life accompanied by an increasing preoccupa-
tion with mere craftsmanship. In “Henley
Day,” ‘William Rowell makes a fairly success-
ful escape from a tendency to photographic
finish. Amalie Feild’s portrait of Gwen Hill
reveals considerable ability and Mrs. Walker
has some soft atmospheric gum-trees. The
veteran Colquhoun, also in this show at Mel-
bourne AthenaeUm, seems to be oite of those
rare painters who are born with an intuitive
sense of reality. Ploughing his lone furrow
he lias turned up a half-dozen little gems of
landscape.
The chief fault., as a painter, of the late
Tom Roberts, whose memorial exhibition is
at the Fine Arts, Melbourne, was over-
statement. An incipient realist, lie was never
quite sure that his eyes were not providing
evidence against his later judgment Some
of his smaller landscapes are assertions
under oath that what he saw was the
truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, but the portraits, except
that of Madame Pfund, flatly contra-
dict the. veracity of his optical witnesses.
This inability to place implicit trust in
his eyesight led Roberts to search for a
style that would- at least have the appear-
ance of verisimilitude. The pilgrimage was
long and included many wanderings up by-
paths. In his large subject-pictures, such
as “The Golden Fleece,” “Shearing the
Rams” and “Bailed Up,” the same timidity
is apparent. The acutest eyes alive could
get: no more than the broadest and simplest
impression of the varied activities of a wool-
shed, but Roberts tried to supplement his
impressions by an elaboration of detail which
destroyed the vitality- of the first impres-
sion. In “Bailed Up” the landscape, being
stationary, is more faithfully portrayed than
the bushrangers and the startled coach pas-
who have more the air of waxwork
figures. The most vital bit of work is ■
head of a young man painted at Granada,
and apparently influenced by Velasouez.. No.
52 is a vivid sketch of a howling baby.
If the Sybil M. Craig who is responsible for
the oils at Melbourne Athenaeum is the Miss
Craig, who is also responsible for the pastels,
she is a Jekyll and Hyde amongst painters.
That the eye which conceived the dainty and
skilful “Blossom” could pass the “Girl in
Pink” is a mystery. There must be some-
thing in the pastel medium that corrupts the
judgment. The biggest still-life, “The
Japanese Jar,” though a trifle insistent on
the beauty of its color scheme, is another
demonstration that the lady can handle
important problems with confidence, pi'o-
vided she attacks them in pigment.
The Cordelle Mason show at Adelaide
Society of Arts has hit the popular taste,
and the low-priced water-colors are going oil:
quickly. The lady is a local drawing-teacher
with European training. Her favorite view-
point is Adelaide seen across the Torrens
lake, and her one amiable weakness is a
faults perspective that brings the hills almost
on top of the city skyscrapers.
The enthusiasm of the Meldrum group
for realism is regarded by some critics
as their chief drawback. In a dozen
or s 0 still-lifes, Justus Jorgensen, Colin
Colahan,- Clarice Beckett, Percy Reason
and Alma Figuerola make no sentimental
appeals to the more obvious emotions, nor
are there clamant exercises in brushwork
shrieking to the observer to note the manual
dexterity of the painter. It is a view
strongly held by both modernists and aca-
demic potboilers that Nature is not good
enough for them. To be made presentable
she must be dressed up in conventional rules
of form and color composition. The show at
the Meldrum Galleries. Melbourne, ought to
help to displace that fallacy, even if it does
not please the seeker after pretty pictures.
Jessie Traill’s one-woman show at the
Society of Arts gallery in Adelaide, has
sheer strength for its chief feature., She is
not yet a Brangwyn, but his influence is all
over' her work. She lias given almost the
appreciative care of an engineer to her draw-
ings and etchings of various stages of the
construction of the Sydney Bridge, and the
Art Gallery of Adelaide takes a wdiole set.
Her paintings are not nearly as good. Her
color does not respond to virility of treat-
ment as does her black-and-white.
“Whitehall”: Some frank impressions of
“Carmen,” as endured at Sydney Her
Majesty’s on last election night. The theatre
was about half-full. Carmen (“as wild and
passionate as she is beautiful,” according
to the story on the programme) proved to
be about five- feet high and fat. She quiv-
ered in embarrassing places as she thundered
about—a- human blancmange. As a comic
character in a film she would have been con-
demned by many critics for vulgarity, Jose’s
acting would have got yells as a talkie bur-
lesqtie of an afflicted hero. In point of fact,
ho got plenty of laughs from the people u>
the row of stalls behind mine, and so did
Carmen. The draughts were bad, and the
seats uncomfortable. A series of dull advts.
were flashed on a screen between each of
the five acts, and portentous intervals fol-
lowed every screening. The army of four
supers, that marched to the gates' of the bull-
ring, without an u.c.o. in charge, was un-
convincing ; .so was the edifice itself —it shook
every time Carmen crossed the stage. Not
to labor the obvious, the whole show, bar-
ring the music, was preposterous. It never
gave anything that even remotely resembled
an illusion of life. I know there are people
who express different sentiments : I watched
them agonising over Melba’s tragically ridi-
culous Mimi in Melbourne six years ago.
But I didn’t believe them. Some day some-
one in authority will tell the truth about
grand opera—that it is a bygone formula, as
remote from life as the harlequinades that
once followed pantomimes. Then it will
be heard only in the one place where (10 P cr
cent, of op.ei'as are capable of giving plea-
sure—at home, over the wireless.

SHADOW SHOWS.
Anyone who wishes to know how the
cinema has raised the world-standard of act-
ing should go to Sydney Prince Edward and
watch a fake of an early silent, which pre-
cedes “This Is the Night.” The extravagant
gestures of the old-timer were the accepted
methods of registering emotions quarter of
a century ago outside the Comedie Franeaise,
the Palais Royal and a few London and New
York theatres. Now naturalism is the rule
even in film melodrama, and the all-round
standard of the more ambitious productions
is equal to the best that the Parisian stage
itself can show. “This Is the Night” has
a French farcical plot. Roland Young is
carrying on with the wife of a javelin-
thrower. By way of proving bis innocence
he hires Lily Damita to pose as his wife,
and Charles Ruggles helps on blundering
lines. Some of the early shots are beautiful,
and the Lubitschian musical jokes are delight-
ful. But the strength of the picture lies in
the witty dialogue and in the restrained
comedy of Young and Ruggles. Young is
another Charles Hawtrey—just as quiet and
finished in his methods and with a better
voice. And you can enjoy such acting any-
where for a shilling or so!
* *
Gloria Swanson has a familiar role in
“To-night or Never,” at Sydney State —that
of a temperamental prima donna whose
golden voice is suffering from the fact that
its owner has never known Pasliun. She is
unawakened, as they say in this kind of
luscious confection. Her Budapest audi-
ences are cold, her press notices in apprecia-
tive. Advisers warn her that her work lacks
warmth. But how can they tell the be-
devilled woman that her basic need is a Great
Lurv? To her despair she isn't invited to
sing in the U.S.A. She is also driven well-
nigh, crazy by a dazzlingly handsome young-
man, who follows her wherever she goes.
He is reported to be a gigolo in the service
of a fat Marchesa. To show her abhorrence
of the creature she contrives a meeting with
him. There are sneers, reproaches and then
—yes, reader, you have guessed aright,
He proves to be the remedy for her debili-
tated art. To quote from the blurb :
The following night everyone, and particularly
Rudig, was amazed by Vago’s marvellous perform-
ance. No one had ever sung “Tosca” so well. Rudig
could not understand her emotions, could not imagine
how she had learned to cry, overnight, until the
maid told him Nella had not returned until six
o’clock that morning and that she was unable to
lind the diva’s pearls. Then he began to under-
stand.
We almost forgot to mention that the awak-
oner isn’t a gigolo. He is a signer-up of
stars for the Metropolitan Opera House,
New York; the Marchesa is his aunt. This
naif rubbish is interpreted by a fine cast,
which includes the Australian Robert Greig,
and it is glamorous with gypsy music, moon-
light. on the Danube, and so on.
* if
“Letty Lynton,” at the St. James, is an
Americanised version of Mrs. Belloc
Lowndes’s book. The original Letty, an un-
convicted English poisoner of the Victorian
era, was probably very like the character
presented by Joan Crawford; that is, an
unstable sensualist, who saw a chance of
getting out of a hole and took it. In the
book the crime is premeditated ; in the talkie
the lady goes to her importunate admirer's
rooms with poison, which she presumably
means to take herself, and looks on in
silence while he takes it. This absolves her from
moral guilt, according to Hollywood ethics,,
and the drama ends on a hilarious note. The
District Attorney knows she is guilty, but
he is short of evidence, and her millionaire
fiance is prepared to swear she spent the
night with him. As his lie is backed up by
her mother and comic maid, there is nothing
for the Law to do but enter the American
equivalent of a nolle prosequi. The
acting and casting are splendid. Joan
Crawford, with eyebrows adjusted by the
plucker’s art at a sinister angle, behaves in
all respects like one of the great army of
wenches who qualify for gaol at an early
age; only, instead of being bleary-eyed,
blowsily-dressed and minus three or four
front teeth, she wears Paris frocks and looks
beautiful. Robert Montgomery supplies a
life-like portrait of the blithesome young ass
who usually marries that sort, of girl in
haste, and repents at leisure; and Nils
Asther is just the type of flashy crook whom
she would be liable to go wrong with first
if the chance offered. Louise Hale overdoes
the farcical touch —cringing away from her
mistress’s seducer in the eai’ly part of the
film, after the manner of a half-wit, and
intoning a wedding-march at the finish with
an exultation which is highly indecent m
the circumstances —but she gets the guffaws
of the unthinking. There are some profound
lessons in life to be learned from this cyni-
cal production if it is examined in the right
spirit, quite apart from its basic and essen-
tially fallacious lesson, which is that a fool
can get away with murder.

Directors of modern Westerns cater for
audiences of the mental age of eight or
under, so they have infused a new ingre-
dient lately into their cowboy-hasli recipe:
The hero is required to play with children.
Sometimes only one infant is featured. He
generally is the only member of the cast who
can act, and, as the befriending cowboy
teaches him to ride, rope ’n shoot, he suc-
ceeds in inflaming most of the spectators
with seething jealousy. Such is the case
in “Partners,” at Sydney Haymarket. Bobby
Nelson is the kid, and Tom Keene is the cow-
boy. who is chased ineffectually by the sheriff
until it is time for him to prove that his
rival murdered the kid’s gran’pa. “Suicide
Fleet,” having denied in a gracious fore-
word that it is anything but fiction, proceeds
to tell what happened to three ,Coney Island
salesmen who joined the navy when Uncle
Sam decided to win the World War. Ginger
Rogers is the girl they leave behind them.
Chief petty-officer Bill Boyd is given com-
mand Of a clipper masquerading as a base
for German submarines. It all ends in
a melodramatic burst of shellfire, with the
three iieroes coming through unscathed after
their ship has been blown to pieces. In
Hollywood they call this making America
sea-minded.

“The Trial of Vivienne Ware,” at Sydney
Regent, is a fair .sample of an American
courtroom drammer —female accused, brow-
beating prosecutor, gallant counsel for de-
fence in love with his client, and murder and
riots within the precincts. The outcome
of the trial can be foreseen by any school-
child, but the producers manage to create
suspense by a variety of clever devices. An
interesting and amusing feature is the close-
ups of a brace of broadcasting announcers—
Richard Gallagher and Zasu Pitts—who tell
the world how the case is going in vivid
slang. Joan Bennett is the heroine-
accused and Donald Cook gets her off.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Akulam”: On the station books Nellie's
ngo was given as 12. Her husband, Tommy,
was a hulking buck of 40. too old and fat
for the stock camp, and so kept for jobs
about the house. Nellie did light domestic
duties, and at mealtimes pulled the punkah.
The boss’s wife was fond of her, and at
the end of each meal gave her a titbit from
the table. It was a severe shock to the lady
when she learnt that Nellie, like the dutiful
wife she was, never tasted the delicacy her-
self, but gave it to Tommy. “Tommy must be
taught a lesson," the missus said. So a
sandwich was made of bread soaked in well-
shaken Worcester sauce, covered with strong
mustard and red pepper and garnished with
three split chillies. The missus handed the
poisonous mixture to Nellie and then scam-
pered to a handy spot to watch the sequel.
As usual. Tommy took the sandwich—and
ate .it with relish. It broke the missus’s
spirit, and next mealtime she handed Nellie
the usual delicacy without comment. Nellie
walked off, but five minutes later returned
with it, and with a flashing of white teeth
put it. to the lady: "S’pose’m you make’m
up like zat one biffore. Missis. Zis one, ’im
bin too much weak-pfeller!"
“Taniwha” : Out of Maorilaud, as Thing-
ummy observed of Africa, comes always some
new thing. A. highly respectable consulting
chemist of Wellington has disclosed that for
some years he imported to the order of a
medico of that city, now deceased, supplies
of the very rare and expensive drug dicyamu.
This was used to make light-filters, some-
what after the fashion of the. screens used in
color-photography. Squinting through one
of these screens at a patient the doctor, so
he used to declare, observed a sort of pris-
matic aura outlining, the person's form. Any
physical derangement would be indicated by
a displacement of the aura, which would
bulge away from the skin at the site of the
trouble. Interesting, if true, but still
stranger is the. statement of the chemist that
the doctor, after using the dicyanin filters
for a while, said he found that he could dis-
cern the aura quite distinctly without their
aid.
“Tiki”: Some kind friend in the Cook
Islands has presented the Auckland (M.L.)
Uugby Union with a battle-axe, once the
property of great chieftains, and with a his-
tory extending back for hundreds of years.
The handle is long and quaintly carved, and
it is a legend that any side numbering that
axe among its weapons is sure of victory.
Whether that applies to the sort of warfare
waged on the football field remains to be
seen. Had the weapon been a Maori axe the
acceptors of it might well have had misgiv-
ings, for it is part of its history that it was
mysteriously lost for 100 years. This might
imply that it had been buried as a muuri to
protect the hau or spirit of a forest The
only possible use anything so dedicated could
have would be as a means of destroying the
hau of the forest, which could be done very
effectively by a malignant and cunning
tohunga. But for anyone but a toliunga to
handle the thing would mean awful disaster.
ANOTHER TRIANGLE.
MARY: “Where you bin all larst night?"
JACK: “Better find out and mind y’ own business.”
MARY: “Yes, I find out orright. I’ll plurry well track you.”
Maoriland rejoices in a legendary buried axe
—Awhiorangi, which has a history as long
and as splendid as that of Excalibur. I
shouldn’t like to find Awhiorangi. But the
Cook Islanders, though akin to the Maoris,
with whom they used to trade and even inter-
marry in olden times, are not very well up
in tolnmgaism, so their gift may have no
barbs about it.

“Chip Shot”: “Brassey” (B. 29/6/’32>
asks what the
crow does with
golf balls. My
theory is that
they got a heap
of amusement
out of them.
Twenty-odd
years ago 1
played a lot in
the Riverina,
and crows were
the devil, especi-
ally on Berthbng
station private
links at Wal-
lendbeen. One
day an employee
came in with
about a dozen
pieces of pills
he had found
under a tree
with a crow's
uest in it. The
bird had neatly
cut round the
circumference of
the balls and
then pulled one
half of the cover
off. It must have
been a difficult
job. A few
years ago I saw
a crow pinch a
ball at Mitchell
(W.Q.). He Hew

anoa Rive r.

ball from about
10 inches each

again, with an

His pursuer's
parting shot as
the bird flew
ayvay in the dis-
tance with in's
treasure was, “£
hope it chokes
ye!”
“FY7”: That yarn
about the man flood-
bound on the Bulloo
(B. 6/7/’32) recalls
another case on the
Balonne, further to the
south. Like the Bul-
loo, the Balonne runs
through flat country
thickly seamed with
billabongs, and when
the flood comes down
with a rush these
cover the country with
water for miles in an
astonishingly short
time. One of Cobb
and Co.’s changing
stations was at Donga
on the St. George-
Surat road among a
labyrinth of dry water-
courses. In one of the
big floods of the early
’nineties, the inhabit-
ants of the change, an
elderly Irish woman of
considerable tonnage
and her husband, had
only time to take to a
hug e coolabah-tree
close by. They man-
aged to get together a
few scraps of tucker,
and the lady took with
her a tiny pig which
was the apple of her
eye. The three, joined
by a few fowls, abode
in the treetops for
over a week. There
was some talk of eat-
ing the fowls raw. but
the old couple jibbed
on it.
■•T.Y.I.” : Romance and youthful endeavor
aren’t dead yet. Know of a case in Southern
Queensland —young fellow and his dad living
on a station. Old man well off, but hard
on the youth (or so the youth thinks) :
young fellow well off and in love—the object
of his affections residing in Sydney. Ttye
old man went to Brisbane on a Sunday and
left his heir in charge. On Monday the
young 'un packed the fencing tools on the
utility, rolled his swag and gave the orders
for the week—he and the jackeroo (a con-
fidant) were going to do a bit of fence-
repairing on the far end of the run. and
would be back on Saturday. The pair got
well into the mulga, dumped the fencing

tools and headed for Sydney. Back on tlto
job on Saturday and drove' in to meet the
old man. And they wouldn’t have been
bowled out but for a letter that came
inquiring why the visiting motorist’s license
hadn’t been handed in.
‘‘Borens” : A pretty little sob story recal-
ling that of the faithful hound Gelert was pub-
lished last week in one of the Sydney papers
which specialise in that sort of thing. A
strange boar visited Russell’s farm a't
\\ ondai (Q.) and attacked Russell, wound-
ing him badly. As he lay helpless on
tin 1 ground, Russell’s own boar butted in
and, giving the intruder the grandfather of
a hiding, drove him away from his boss.
Much has been made of the faithfulness of
the Russell pig, but having known something
of pigs tame and wild, I am inclined to
doubt that aspect of the story. There is
money to say that Russell’s pig didn’t care
a grunt for what happened to his owner. His
action was due to the fact that there wa*
the . possibility of a strange sheik trying to
vamp his own harem.

“Der .Tong”: The Afrikanders, both in the
Union and out of it, have set Australia an
example in the matter of safeguarding native
fauna. In addition to the great East African
reserves and those in the Northern Trans-
vaal, three more have been opened in the
Cape Province. One is of 3000 square miles
on the Kalahari, where the vanishing gems-
bok will be preserved. Another is in the
south-west of the Cape, where an area has
been Set aside for the even rarer bontebok.
FinaHy, on the eastern side of the Cape.
1100 acres of forest have been reserved fo-
the Addo elephants which still linger in
the forest of that name—the last survivors
of the once swarming herds to be found,
nowadays, south of the Rinipopo. In
traha nothing has been done except the
establishment of a few piffling parks and the
institution of close seasons which are con
stantly being opened to oblige skin- or fur-
hunters. It took only 50 years to practically
extirpate the vast herds of game of all kinds
that thronged the veldts of South Africa

tate does not overtake our unique fauna
THE GLOUCESTER LIONESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Gloucester (N.S.W.) police are convinced
that the lioness reputed to be at large in the district
is a very large and tawny dingo.”
“A lioness at large out back of Gloucester.”
The rumor ran like wildfire to and fro.
Some travelling menagerie had lost her,
They reckoned, six or seven years ago,
Though how it was that nobody had crossed
her
Wild path before nobody seemed to know ;
Nor did it. when a score of eyes had seen
her,
Matter a tinker’s deener.
They armed them for the hunting, grimly
zealous;
Rifles and guns from dusty racks came
down;
From dawn to even scores of sturdy fellows
Ranged far and wide o’er Bulliac drear
and brown.
An atmosphere of Roosevelt and Selous
Seemed to envelop placid Gloucester town,
Where each man hoped to be rolenir dco
Slayer of Felix Leo.
They loaded automatic and repeater,
Refurbished fowling-piece and blunderbuss.
These Latin tags are hard to fit. in metre.
And yet you might epitomise it thus,
I think: Parturiunt m antes nascetur —
No, not, a mouse, that’s too ridiculous:
No animal with leonine pretensions
Gould shrink to those dimensions.
Was it a horrid dream ? A nightmare vision
By falling shades and failing nerves
begot ?
Nay, stay your mocking and forbear deri-
sion,
1 wouldn’t say whether it is or not.
Note only- with what positive decision
The cops have put their fingers on the
spot.
No lioness at large for them, by jingo!
Merely an outsize dingo.

don’t agree with “FY7” (B.
22/6/’32) when he says the red kangaroo i„
uglier in a tight corner than a grey one The
red ’roo never rips, with his hind toe as does
the_ grey, but relies on a hearty squeeze
varied by a little, clawing and an occasional
bite to out his opponent. Both are nasty to
deal with, unless you know the method. Take
a short stick in the left hand and a longer
stout one in the right and walk up to Mr.
’Roo. Hand him the short stick as he comes
at you—he’ll grab at it —and then swing the
long one with a round sweep to the side of
the head. That should out him, but if it
doesn’t retreat and leave him to squeeze the
sheepdog that has- come - within his reach.
Don’t hit downwards—his head isn’t there
when the stick arrives.

“Mako”: The report that Canterbury
sheepfarmers are patrolling their runs-with
firearms won’t surprise anyone who knows
anything of the methods of M.L. sheep-
stealers. For years the big run-liolders
have been harassed by the thieves,
NO TIME FOE THEY WRITTEN SERMONS.
“What did ’ee think of Brother Treloor's sermon this mornin', William?”
"Not much; ha'f av un ought ’ave been put in the bath-heater.”
some of whom recently visited isolated parts
of stations with lorries and removed up
to 200 sheep in a night. But the stealing
has not been confined to organised gangs. It
became evident that otherwise respectable
citizens went out in their cars with their
families on the Sabbath, ostensibly to-picnic
amid the beauties of Nature, but actually to
shoot and remove for home consumption a
prime lamb or so; Bolder marauders tire
from a lorry into a flock, selecting the best
carcasses and leaving those they don’t con-
sider up to standard
“Butterboy”: After the 1929
disturbance in the Shivery Isles
a strange pungent odor was notice-
able in many parts. It was traced
to cold springs; these bubbled up
very strongly, and showed a white
scum on a black sulphurous sand.
Strangely enough they often
occurred on hillocks and at other
times bubbled from the very creek-
beds. They were similar to the hot
springs, the smell being apparently
due to the presence of sulphuretted
hydrogen in large quantities. When
a bottle of freshly-collected water
was tightly corked the pressure of
the escaping gas was sufficient to
burst the bottle. These springs
have continued in varying volume
to the present date.
“Hamer”: The start of a boy
farm hand on the road that led to
his becoming one of Melbourne’s
best-known booksellers is told by
Brabazon, who w’us the farm boy.
In his younger days he had no
chance of getting books, but the
book-love was implanted when he
discovered, thrown aside in the
farmhouse where he was working,
a copy of Olive Schreiner’s “Story
of an African Farm.” The lad
asked his harsh Scottish-born task-
mistress, who usually allowed no
books other than the Bible (except-
ing textbooks) in the house, if he
could read it. “Oh, you can have
it.” . returned the woman, “but
you’re not going to waste time on
that, trash. I saw it on a bookstall the last
time I came from Melbourne, and I bought
it because I thought it would have some
hints on farming.”

“Bedourie”: That yarn • about the lady
crow being put to death because she hatched
out a turkey’s egg (B. 15/6/’32) reminds
me of a happening in far western Queensland
years ago. At that time the crows were
such' a pest that Marsupial Boards paid you
for. their eggs as well as their heads. One day
1 gathered six eggs from a nest and set off on
my old pony for the township to claim the
bounty. When I got there I was informed
that the egg payment had been suspended.
With tears of disappointment—l was under
10 years old —-I put the eggs inside my shirt
and started back again to the station. About
four miles out I felt an extraordinary agita-
tion inside my shirt. Investigation showed
that, what with the hot weather and the
heat of my body, six crows had hatched.
Turning the pony round I went back to the
BORN UNLUCKY.

“Flycatcher”: Recently a number of so-
called cattle egrets were turned loose in the
big English open-air zoo at Wipsnade Park
to free the deer and cattle there of ticks and
other pests. These birds are well known in
Eastern Asia, where they may be seen
perched on the backs of buffaloes and other
cattle. Some bright genius has suggested
that a number be imported to Australia to
free our northern cattle herds of tick and
the buffalo-fly. This country, with memories
of the rabbit, prickly-pear and other im-
ported curses, will not jump at. the sugges
tion. Once the egret is imported some of the
many other birds known to make a living-
in this way—-the South African rhinoceros
bird, for example-—may apply for admis-
sion and the last end of the situation will be
worse than the first. The egret may be a
blessing in his own country. There" is no
saying what he may turn out in an Austra-
lian environment.
* * *
“Bombex”: There can be no doubt that
General Depresli has enlisted some stout
fellows in the ranks of crime. Consider the
complaint in a Sydney journal that bee-
keepers are being robbed on an exten-
sive scale by people who raid their hives
and extract the' combs. Writer has had
to deal with many wild and domesticated
animals in his time, but, saving, perhaps, the
sheep, there is not one of all the lot which
lie < dreads so much as the bee. Since boy-
hood, bees have made a point of flying for
miles to sting him. The tropical variety,
met with in the Papuan jungles, has made
life even worse by crawling all over him to
drink the salt of his perspiration, smearing
him meanwhile with its honey. One
can stop a charging lion or elephant, but
what use is a .450 express against a swarm
of pertinacious and indignant bees? No. The
men who have been robbing those beehives
command my entire respect. I dips me lid to
’em,
* * * *
“Maluka”: Keeping accounts is a
minor item in the multitude of jobs that fall
to the lot of a book- and storekeeper on the
large cattle stations of the more isolated
parts of the continent. Not only has he to
kill and salt the beef, act as boundary-rider,
attend to the homestead Avindmills, keep the
motor-car —if the station possesses one—in
good order, look after the garden and fowls
and see to the general cleanliness of the
homestead surroundings, but in North Aus-
tralia and the Kimberleys, where blacks
form the greater part of the station comple-
ment. he has to be doctor, dentist and
barber. So great is Binghi’s perverted lik-
ing for “white man med’sin” that the book-
keeper is hard put to know the genuine cases
from the malingerers. His efforts at dentis-
try earn him more abuse than thanks. He
is at the beck and call of everyone on the
station. If he crosses out items on the list
of stores for the mustering camp, the stock-
men say he is toadying to the boss and abuse
him sinfully. If he gives the men all they
ask for the manager reviles him bitterly. To
add to the hardness of his lot, the stockmen
never tire of telling him what an easy life
is his. “You have a hard time? Why,
you’re always at the station eating . eggs'!”
The last straw is provided by the exasper-
ated accountants at the head office, who write
commenting blisteringly on the carelessness
of his book-keeping.
“Nakh”: A hefty draught horse died mys-
teriously at Maffra (Vic.) the other day.
Stumbling in front of his load he rolled over
into a bed of'thistles three feet highVt and
although previous to the misadventure he
had been in splendid health he died within
two hours. Experts are dubious' about
whether the formic acid in the thistles could
possibly have penetrated his hide An suffi-
cient quantity to kill him, and point out
that he got rapidly'worse after his owners
started massaging him with, vinegar.
* * * . *
“C.Q.”: The problem of the Quamby kan-
garoos is to be solved at last. The animals
have multiplied on this estate, which is about
25 miles from Warrnambool. until its owners
are not sure whether they are breeding
sheep or keeping a ’roo farm. The Govern-
ment has come to their rescue' by offering
4100 acres of the reservation at 'Fraffiling-
ham. A few ancient abos. with their dwind-
ling progeny eke. out their, lives on the old
settlement, having refused to migrate to Lake
Tyers. To transfer the-hoppers from the
race at Quamby to their new grazing grounds
will occupy some weeks,- as they number
close on 2000 tails.

“Dai It.”: The piscivorous parasite men-
tioned by “Jim Jams" (B. fi/7/’32) is found
a good deal lower down than Queensland.
Humping bluey down the N.S.W. North Coast,
a cobber and I camped at Ulmarra. In the
dead o’ night I was wakened by a tremen-
dous itching, and found my mate massaging
his tout ensemble with great vigor. He told
me some brown blankards had bitten him, and
in support of his statement produced a bcastie
that tallies with “Jim Jam’s” description.
We threw some wood on the fire, and the
blaze produced such a swarm of the insects
that we had to beat a retreat. I mentioned
the experience to a native next day, and he
said, “Aw, y’ad the fish-flies in fer supper.”

WELL-KNOWN SYDNEY IDENTITY.
Most pressmen are acquainted with the,
underworld Czar who was complained ot
recently in Sydney “Sun” “from a background
of real terror” —the “S. European burglar-
gangster, whose mistress is a beautiful
brunette with hair bobbed a la Garbo”;
the “fiendish parasite who always carries an
automatic and a curved-blade knife under his
vest near the left armpit,” and who "swag-
geringly boasts that he is home-
sick for the ‘cha-cha-eha' of
machine-guns.”
A 1 (“Gorilla”) Bunkadillo lie
likes to be called, though he was
known till recently in the lace
department at Spiff, Goods and
Go. as Mr. Art Simpkins. It
was really his acne that got him
tlm sack. Customers said it was
contagious. His young lady,
Miss Effie Jones, the brunette
mentioned above, left the fancy-
goods under a cloud at about
the same time, and they teamed
up in the sinister and hideously
widespread Darlinghurst Land-
lady-bilking Racket.,
Art’s affray with Domenico
Salvadore is talked of in the
Surry Hills Younger Fruiterers’
Set to this day. With the
chilled-steel nerve of a Capone
he tried to racketeer a couple
of bananas. They say he bore
the mark where Domenico
kicked him for over a week. It embittered
him. Miss Jones (Lovely Lupe Eseamillo to
reporters), what with fallen arches, dys-
pepsia and corns, has become embittered, too.
The gang sticks at nothing. Milk
and newspaper pinchings o’ mornings; the
Blind Girl Racket (Effie wearing the
glasses and Art carrying the tin) ; the Penny
"Bipod” Newspaper Racket—the two des-
peradoes work them all. In the course of
a single week Art has sold himself, at five
bob a time, to different newspaper proprie-
taries as a two-gun bandit, from Chi., a
bucko mate off an unnamed Hell Ship, the
Chief of an Australian Maffia Society, and
a member of the Burwood O.G.P.U. Miss
Jones usually figures as liig, mistress, unless
she is a persecuted Russian aristocrat. Art
always “speaks from a background of terror”
since the day he tried one of his marrow-
chillers on the “S. M. Herald,” and narrowly
escaped being given in charge for trying to
btain money bv false pretences.

THE AMAZING ANCIENT.
“As good a bit of work behind the pack
as I’ve seen!”
I started, and looked in astonishment at the
ancient by my side; He went on: “They
talk about the old-timers being better than
the present-day footballers. Rubbish!” I
gasped. Only that day I had read in the
“Guff” about the prejudiced views of these
septuagenarian sticklers for the giants of the
onry part of the century.
“But. surely,” I said, “you wouldn’t com-
pare this halfback with the famous Mc-
Swizzle, who led the AVallaroos to victory in
’04?”
“McSwizzle wasn’t as nippy as this chap ;
he Avas slower at getting the ball away from
the base of the scrum, and didn’t work the
blind side as well.”
I came back again bravely: “Anyhow,”
I said with warmth, “one thing you’ve got
to admit, none of the moderns can kick at
goal like ‘Dally’ ”
"Rot!” snapped the veteran. “That lasi
one the fullback landed, with a greasy ball,
and at a difficult angle from half-way, was
better than anything I’ve seen on this
ground, and I’ve been following the game,
man and boy, for 55 years.”
“But,” I cried, “Plantagenet Gusbalot, of
the ‘Sunday Tripe,’ a recognised authority,
although I’ll admit he never got beyond
reserve grade, always contends”
"Pali! So much twaddle!, A popular
fallacy that the sensational press plays up
to. The standard of play to-day is higher
than ever.”
Sadly, my mind tottering, I staggered away
and sought surcease in a prussic-acid cock-
tail.
My last wish is that a few of our sport-
ing writers may be persuaded to do like-
wise.

“I’m fired!”
“Gootness! And not insured!”
“Married quarrels!” said George Judkins

able, of course, but, after all, they breed
peace as well as trouble.” IHs daughter had

FOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE.
“He said he was made president of the Lyars’
Club at Cambridge University through his ability
to drink a pint of beer in 3 l-ssee.”
—“Sunday Sun.’'
Professor Hie Hogshead, D.A.. who has
just returned from his alcoholidays, said
that he was doing his best to beer up under
the staggering strain of the newer education.
The thirst for knowledge was so great that
elbow-room was hard to find; thousands were
cramming for their final D.T.’s. Alechemists,
he said, had definitely established that-
Beer is 100 p.c. vatamins.
Malt is not indigenous to Malta.
The hop plant, not the horse, is man’s best friend.
All the old theories had gone bung and our
ancient seats of learning were now soaked
with something more inspiring than tradi-
tion. Already Professor Dipso had .given his
life for experimentation. The new brews had
come into being a bit too fast for him. The
future beer wars of the Empire would be
won on the playing fields of Oxxxford.
So saying, the professor left abruptly. The
brewers’ waggons were beginning to arrive
and the bells to clang for a resumption of
studies. McM.

WOMAN’S RIGHTS.
Poignant inquiry in Melbourne “Sub-
Pictorial” :
Is it the wife's place to put out and take 'in
the dustbin? What do other wives do?—Yours et}-..
WED.
When Gwladys and I got married we re-
solved to make our lives one long honey-
moon. So she drew up an agendum defining
my duties :
(D Let it be very clearly understood that !it
is the husband’s privilege to help his wife in all
things.
(2) He shall make and serve early-morning tea.
(3) He shall clean all fireplaces.
(4) He shall put out and take in, as required,
all garbage-tins, milk-jugs, eats, etc., etc.
(5) Ho shall answer all telephone calls after the
household has retired, and examine the premises
for burglars when instructed so to do.
(6) He shall clean and polish all shoes,, boots,
grates, windows and door-knockers.
(7) Ho shall shake all mats.
(8) He shall wash the dog and take same for
walks as directed.
(9) He shall, when his wife is out at bargain
•ales, bridge parties, political or other meetings,
theatres, dances or other social duties, have a suit-
able hot meal ready to sustain, cheer, comfort and
oik ourage her on her return.
(10) He shall wash up afterwards.
There were some more, but they are im-
material. The foregoing were the ones
that led me to leave the wife after six
strenuous month's, and swear off matrimony.

Then growled: “Lord, man don't whimper

And we’re cheery as cheery can he.
When strangers are round we’re disposed to

Our mutual feelings we smother.

Two Outstanding' High- f
power "Sporter” Rifles*
T^ar
© The “M.S. Special
.303 Lee ILnlieid Sporter
Realising the demand for a light, well-balanced higli-power sporting rifle adapted to the popular
and inexpensive .303 Service cartridge, the “M.S. Special” was designed by us, and is entirely
rebuilt in our own factory under the personal supervision of Mr. Dan McCarthy, one of the
most expert armourers in Australia. Unnecessary wood is removed from the. fore-end, which
is then shaped to the graceful design illustrated. A high “comb” is built-in to the stock,
giving a drop at comb of If infixes, and a drop at heel of 3 inches. With these proportions
the shooter’s eve falls into the line of sight the instant his cheek touches the stock.
The
weight of the “M.S. Special” lies between and 7f pounds, and is carefully distributed so
that the point of balance is placed approximately 47 inches in front of the trigger. This gives
the rifle the light responsive “feel” of a well-balanced trap gun, and makes it ideal for quick
light responsive
handling in scrubby country and for shots at moving game.
The barrel of the standard model is 23 inches in length, and is provided with the popular blade
target front sight set in a high ramp, and “click” adjusting wind-gauge open rear sight, which
allows the shooter to change instantly from Mark VI to Mark VII ammunition. Variations
from the standard barrel length may be had to special order at no extra charge.
Only specially-selected Government actions are used in the construction ot the “M.S. Special,”
and correct fitting and “head-spacing” of the bolt is guaranteed.
This Rifle fills a long-felt want among the kangaroo- and alligator-shooters, and, although entirely
new, has already created a steady demand in New South Wales, Queensland and the Far North.

The Most Sensational Rifle in the History of Modern
High-power Sporting Firearms!
“The .22 Savage
Hornet Sporter.”
The new Savage Model 23D chambered for the remarkable “.22 HORNET” cartridge, is similar
in general design to the well-known and deservedly popular Savage Sporter. It has a 23 inch
barrel of special Hi-power Smokeless Steel, equipped with Lyman gold bead front, and flat top
sporting rear sight. Receiver is tapped and drilled for aperture rear sight or telescope sight.
The magazine is of new design, being curved so that the rim of each cartridge lies in front
of the one immediately below it. This permits a perfect feed. Five cartridges in the magazine
and one in the chamber place six shots at the command of the shooteiv
The “.22 HORNET” cartridge shoots a mushroom point metal-jacketed bullet of 45 grains weight
at 2600 feet per second muzzle velocity, and develops 675 foot pounds energy at the muzzle.
Almost. UNDREAMED-OF ACCURACY and an amazingly flat trajectory are the outstanding
features of this extraordinary new rifle.

Your Old Tyre
REBUILT
not merely retreaded
Since the introduction of this pew and better
tyre service, motorists have been quick to
realise the immense superiority and un-
doubted saving of the Ravdell method. Be-
low we give you some idea of the thorough
expert attention which is given to your tyre
in this modern way of rebuilding your used
tyres. Every one of the phases illustrated
below is essential to the renewed life of your
tyre and each one of which is carried out in
its entirety only by the Ravdell Rubber Co.
Ravdell, remember, will never attempt to
rebuild a tyre that is not worth rebuilding,
for all Ravdell work is GUARANTEED IN
WRITING. The Company will do only
quality work which will stand up to the job—
therefore, they will do only work that is
worth doing.
Eight Phases in the “Ravdell” Rebuilding Process.
ID
i\
!
Lit
Expert Examination.
An expert tests the tyre sent for
rebuilding, immediately it comes
into ouv Workshop. This examin-
ation, by a special appliance, in-
cludes a minute inspection of the
inside walls of the cover to dis-
cover if there are any apparent
defects.
Old Rubber Stripped Off.
No old rubber whatsoever is
left 011 the tyre—every particle
is stripped off. The advantage
of this, obviously, is that only
good, clean, fresh, live rubb<
goes into the making of a Ravdell
rebuilt tyre, and, therefore, from
the canvas outward the rebuilt
tyre is ENTIRELY NEW.
Three Coats of Solution.
In rebuilding a tyre, Ravdell
apply THREE coats of solution,
and this Ravdell solution is made
by us from a secret formula, in
order to ensure that the solution
is one hundred per cent, efficient.
Surface Buffed.
When every particle of rubber
is removed, the surface of the
cover is buffed by an absolutely
new method. This results in a
surface which makes for perfect
gripping, entirely eliminating the
possibility of non-adhesion.
m
f S
2. .
Putting on Junction Rubber.
This is an extra service which
we employ in rebuilding tyres.
In order that there will be no
possibility of non-adhesion between
the surface and the camel-back,
junction rubber, which is raw
rubber, is placed on the solution.
Putting on Camel-back.
The camel-back (Tyre tread)
used by us is a special quality
compounded mixture, containing
approximately -seventy-five per
cent, pure rubber, which is
EXACTLY the same as used in
treads on the highest-grade quality
new tyres.
Rolling Out Air Bubbles.
Nothing is left to chance by the
Ravdell Rubber Co., and special
machinery has been installed to
mechanically roll out all air
bubbles. There is absolutely no
possibility of any air passages or
bubbles remaining after the rubber
has been through our new Ravdell
process.
Steam-cured Vulcanising.
Our Ravdell process docs to the
rubber what oxy-welding does to
steel. Ravdell rebuilt tyres are
steam-cured, which ensures
thorough vulcanising and resulting
in the perfect tyre, which will
give not less than 5(100 miles
road service.

FARM ACCOUNTS
The articles published on “The Bulletin’s” Land page have
been reprinted and added to.
In these lessons the farmer who did not previously know a
thing about book-keeping is carried along, step by step, and
shown how accounts are kept. Every entry is explained in the
simplest and clearest possible language.
The object is to enable the farmer to put his business on a
proper basis and keep it there.
In no other calling is it more necessary to follow every
branch of the business and see where a profit is being made
and where a loss.
Many a farmer has come to grief simply through not knowing
that he was going back a little further every year. Had he
known in time he might have made changes that would have
saved the situation.
The trouble about most attempts to show the farmer how to
keep accounts is that they assume he knows something about
book-keeping.
* The Bulletin/* at the request of scores of farm readers,
decided to produce a cheap textbook in which the whole
business of book-keeping would be dealt with from the very
beginning.
The little book is published at a price which brings it within
the means of everybody. It will be sent from any “Bulletin”
Office for sixpence, to which must be added 2d. for postage.
Though designed primarily for the man on the land, it will be
found just as valuable to traders and others who have hitherto
had only a foggy idea about accounts.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
MALLEE FARMERS MUST FALLOW!
“Glenfield”: Up to the year of the big
drought the Vic. Malice cocky was a pro-
gressive tiller of the soil, always on the
lookout for fresh knowledge and applying it.
Then came the depression, with low prices
and more or less financial shipwreck. Since
then paddocks have been cropped continu-
ously to wheat; reliance has been placed on
self-sown ; fallowing and rotation have been
thrown overboard. This season not 80 p.c. of
the farmers of the Ouyen district, at any
rate, have fallow to sow.
But what of coming seasons? Constant
cropping exhausts the available supply of
some essential plant food, and the ensu-
ing yield of a crop is limited by the available
supply of that food. Come what may, we
must get back to sane methods. Exhaustion
of the humus supply is usually a funda-
mental cause of decrease in crop yield, since
humus furnishes the nitrogen by its decom-
position and encourages the fixation of free
nitrogen. Exhaustion of humus will be
accompanied by a shortage of nitrogen.
Humus can be replaced by the use of
sheep and other stock. Sheep manure is the
most valuable of available animal manures,
being drier and more evenly spread than the
others; ploughing-in of stubble and decaying
plant roots into the fallow also helps to fer-
tilise the soil. An ample supply of humus
enables the fallow to hold the soil moisture,
and the soil is. then in a better condition for
the development of soil organisms.
Much care and thought must be used in
working Mallee fallows. Too much cultivat-
ing in the late spring and early summer
works the fallow down too finely, and fertile
soil is lost through erosion by wind; in the
heavier country, the soil opened up and that
ploughed in for humus dry up and are also
carried away. Then nitrogen may escape
to the air and leave an unfavorable physical
condition of the soil which will limit the
crop yield. Probably more soil fertility is
lost in this way than by continuous cropping.
In the absence of sheep, there was much
prolific weed growth on the fallows this year,
owing to the heavy autumn rains ; in many
cases farmers have had to plough their
fallows before seeding. Experience, has
shown that fallow ploughed a second time in
this manner is fallow spoiled ; the turning-
over of the ground apparently allows the soil
nitrogen to escape to the air, and affects the
yield. The ideal fallowing method seems
to be to plough in June or July and finish
cultivating by the end of September and
let sheep do the rest. However, the Mallee
cocky must fallow and fallow thoughtfully.
FALLOWS IN N. S. WALE Sr
Conditions in N. S. Wales last year were
against high-class fallows; nevertheless, the
departmental instructors who judged the fal-
lowing competitions in various wheat-grow-
ing districts report that an excellent stand-
ard was reached in spite of difficulties. The
methods of the winners as outlined in the
“Agricultural Gazette” are full of interest.
In the south-west district G. Gow was
first among- the Barellan farmers who com-
peted in the open-country section. His land is
a very heavy loam, and he ploughed in July,
1930, but did not sow last season on account
of the wet. The fallow was combined and
cross-combined in September, 1931, and
scarified in March and April. In the malice
section, the winner was J. W. Costolloe, who
scarified his land in July, August, November
and March. The Ariah Park competition
was won by D. W. Edis, who ploughed in
.1 uly, spring-toothed in September and
October, and combined in January and
March. In Ungarie M. J. Vallance was
awarded first place for “a particularly fine
entry,” which was mouldboard-ploughed in
June, scarified in August and combined in
September and March. Here the soils are
mostly light; at Quandialla the land farmed
by the prize-winner, A. L. Harnett, is of
a heavy self-mulching character. It was scari-
fied in August and October, sundercut in
November and February and scarified in
March. First in the Tullibigeal competition
was J. Blair, whose heavy country was
mouldboard-ploughed in August, spring-
toothed in October and January, and com-
bined in March. In Yaddra “the fallow
exhibited by W. J. Norris was outstanding,
its strong points being moisture content, com-
pactness and cleanliness.” The land was
scarified in July, combined in October and
scarified in March.
In Young excessive winter rains made it
impossible to plough until well into the
spring, and then conditions were suitable
only for a short period ; further operations
were then restricted until good rains in the
late summer months made it possible to work
the fallows. First place was awarded to
I. C. Thackeray. His fallow, a medium red
loam, was mouldboard-ploughed 4in. deep in
July, harrowed in September, cultivated in
December before harvest and again in
January, and harrowed in February and
March. -
CULTIVATION OF SUB. CLOVER.
“Trifolium’s” points
< B b/ </ 32) will bear elaborating. With
ordinary seedings of about 21b. per acre three
stages m the development of a sub. pasture
are apparent. . For the first two seasons the
clover is getting a foothold and the cover
is incomplete. It must be carefully nursed
during this period, especially when it is
setting seed.
. For next two or three years the ground
is completely covered with sub. plants dur-
mg their season of growth, and other species
get a bad time. Owing to the nitrogen-fixing
properties of the clover and to accumulation
of humus, the soil becomes greatly enriched,
conditions now favor the development of
non-legumes and they increase accordingly.
If the species present ate of any use this
is all to the good and a well-balanced forage
results. The sub. grower should see that
useful grasses are present in the pasture;
the best plan is to sow a few pounds of truly
perennial rye grass or cocksfoot, or both,
same time as the sub. The grasses won’t
show up for the first three years, but as
soon as soil conditions are favorable they
will be found to develop and thicken up
with almost amazing rapidity. A pure diet
of sub. or any other clover is a common
cause of congestion troubles in stock. Bloat-
ing of cows and pulpy kidney of lambs are
instances. A well-balanced mixture of grass
and clover will prevent these ailments and
reduce- the losses.
Establishing sub. without cultivation is a
slow business. Better to run the spring-
tooth or similar implement over the area,
broadcast sub. and super., and follow up with
the harrows. At Ross (Tas.) the Depart-
ment: of Agriculture established trial plots
three years ago. Each plot is six acres in
area and an accurate record of all stock
carried has been kept. The rainfall is 19in.
Control plots (no treatment) carried 1.1
ewes per acre, while in its second season the
plot treated as indicated above carried 3.9.
This shows a fair margin of profit, but next
year should show even better results, as the
clover is still coming.
Write off the cost of the initial cultiva-
tion and seeding over a 10-year period, add
the cost of applying lewt. of super, each
year, again add Is. per acre for the annual
harrowing and figure the profit for yourself.
DEEP SUBSOILING.
“R. K. Deea”: Deep subsoiling is rarely
practised, but when it is the usual objective
is 'the shattering of an impervious strata
occurring between soil and subsoil, or in such
a position as to disturb the soil reservoir
and natural drainage. An instance is quoted
of a hill paddock in South Gippsland. \
The crest of the hill, a small area, gave
poor returns when sown to rape, oats,
potatoes and grass in succession, although
the remainder of the paddock on the side of
the hill produced satisfactory returns. The
soil to plough depth was normal and even.
However, a posthole sunk on the area of
poor response exposed a narrow band of
cementy silt-sand separating the soil from
the subsoil at. a depth of 14 inches. This
impervious layer in shutting off the soil from
the subsoil decreased the soil reservoir suffi-
ciently to produce the poor crops. The use
of the subsoil plough working at a depth of
16iu. produced the desired result, and now
the paddock gives even returns. Shallow or
tine subsoiling would not have reached the
refractory band. Deep subsoiling did the
trick.
“Clarenza” (B. 22/6/’32) suggests that
deep subsoiling depreciates the fertility of
the soil. I don’t agree! The only plant food
washed out of a soil to any extent is soluble
nitrogen (nitrate). This does not, or should
not, happen from a cropped field, but even
assuming that it does, and that deep sub-
soiling accelerates the loss, does not this
prove that the drainage is made more effec-
tive? Good drainage is half the battle; with-
out it the best farmer, farming under the
best of conditions, will not derive full bene-
fit from the soil. The amount of phosphoric
acid and potash washed out by deep sub-
soiling. or at all, would not grow sufficient
sugar-cane to provide the sugar for a cup
of tea.
CULTIVATION AND EROSION.
“D..T.H.” : Soil erosion, and what might be
called “slipping” are attributable very
largely to careless cultivation. In all cultiva-
tion cross-ploughing should be undertaken in
rotation. By this method you break the
hardpan naturally caused by one-way plough-
ing and make a draughtboard lower-soil for-
mation. This criss-cross method holds the
moisture and thus softens the soilbed, allow-
ing as time goes on deeper ploughing, better
root food and better cropping. One-way
ploughing tends to form an under-soil drain
that admits of water, as it percolates
through the top, soaking away to one end
of the paddock. Loose soil tends to drift
with the moisture and eventually the top
or higher end of the paddock gets thin and
bare. When slipping occurs plough and
harrow back to the poor end to levej off.
A great deal of the slipping and erosion
can be beaten by small check banks. These
are especially beneficial on hillside cultiva-
tion, where, no> matter how careful you are,
soil will wash'. When you cultivate on a
hillside always use the lower flats as well;
you’ll find them get richer each year as the
new soil and manure come down periodically.
I’ve found these lower flats the ideal spot
for lucerne, with an automatic top-dress-
ing. Never plough straight up and down a
hill ; plough from side to side or angle-wise.
If you do go from topi to bottom you’ll only
court trouble.

".T. Point”: Many Queensland farmers
and graziers get good results from the feed-
ing of molasses to stock ; many more use it
and are disappointed, simply ‘ because they
fail to appreciate its limitations. Mixed with
chaffed green maize, sorghum, saccaline, etc
molasses will induce the cattle to eat more
of these feeds than they would otherwise do
Its mineral content is also valuable, and
its laxative properties are useful when the
succulence of the hay, ensilage, etc., has been
replaced by excess fibre. But, though a use-
ful and cheap supplement to the winter
ration, it contains no protein, and protein
is the element which overshadows all others
in importance when making up winter
rations. Bran and pollard will give «-ood
results where the natural pasture.is good or
where lucerne chaff or hay is fed. but
when the mainstay is the usual chaffed
winter greenstuff or "ensilage, something richer
still in protein, such as cottonseed meal or
linseed meal, is recommended.
navel oranges.
“Shadlow”: The true Australian navel
orange (B. 6/7/’B2) was developed in Aus-
tralia from original plantings of Brazilian
origin. It was introduced into California-
in 1574, when the first commercial plantings
of citrus were made there; the parents of
the modern Washington navel were intro-
duced from South America about the same
time. The Australian navel was found to
be a shy bearer, and the fruit to have a
tendency to large size, with too prominent
navel formations. The superior quality and
heavier yield of the new type led to its
adoption under the name of Washington
navel, as the main orange of commerce in
California. In Florida the Washington is
considered to be a shy bearer.
Commercial plantings of navels in Aus-
tralia in the last 25 years have been, nomi-
nally, at least, of the Washington navel.
Those introduced in the early days of the
Chaffey settlements at Renmark and Mil-
dura are equal to any produced anywhere
in California. The navel orange has, how-
ever, a tendency to sport, and unless pro-
pagated from good types and grown under
suitable conditions, sliows marked variation
in quality.
Of Australia’s annual production of
4,000,000 bushels of oranges more than 33
per cent., roughly 11 million, consists of
navels. Irrigation areas of the M.1.A., Mil-
dura and South Aus., contribute a million
bushels. Of these at least 60 per cent, are
export quality, but overseas economic con-
ditions and transport facilities are unfavor-
able. _ Other disadvantages are that the
citrus industry is diffused over a wide range
of soil and climatic conditions, and there
is lack of standardisation. Seventy-five per
cent. of Californian oranges—-roughly
35,000,000 bushels p.a.—are produced within
200 miles of Los Angeles. In the 450 miles
between the S.A. and Murrumbidgee .irriga-
tion areas there is an orange production of
million bushels, less than half of which
is packed under conditions that would
ensure continuity of supply and uniformitv
of quality.
CI-lICK MORTALITY.
“Jack Point”: Only under very favorable
conditions may chicks be allowed to run on
the ground with safety. This may sound
unnatural, but most diseases from which
chicks die are transmitted through the soil,
either from germs left by previous occupiers
or through the droppings of infected ones.
Unless, therefore, the ground is known to be
clean (which means that it has not beeu
occupied by any sort of poultry for at least
a year, and that a green crop has been grown
on it since), portable pens should- be used.
These pens can be made on a fairly light
framework, netted at all four sides, the
floor consisting of tightly stretched small
mesh wire-netting which clears the ground
by three or four inches. If these are placed
on a grassy patch, the chicks are able to
pick at the green feed with safety, and the
pens may be shifted frequently. Water
and food containers should also be arranged
on the outside, so that the chicks have to
put their heads through the netting to feed
and drink, and are not able to get into the
vessels to contaminate or waste the contents.
PIGS AND SUNLIGHT.
“Booraby”: “The pig is a sun-loving
animal.” That is the first thing to be con-
sidered in building a sty, but in too many
instances the pig is the worst-housed animal
on the farm. Any old log or slab structure
seems to be thought good enough as long as
it will keep him from breaking out. It is
often too small, and the limited yard always
wet and foul. Pigs like to wallow, and to lie
in mud and water, as on the edge of a swamp,
on hot days; but a cold, wet sty doesn’t
spell comfort in winter.
Our sties were divided into narrow runs,
facing the sun, and leading into a small
square paddock, where the different lots could
be let out at any time to exercise and
amuse themselves by rooting about. Across
the opposite ends of the runs was the shed,
the outer part of which was a long passage,
where pumpkins, grain and other food were
kept, and whence the various lots could be
fed comfortably in wet weather. The other
longitudinal section of the shed was divided
into two floored compartments for each run.
One was the feeding pen, open on the sun
side ; the other was the sleeping pen. which
was closely walled all round, about sft. high,
with a small gateway leading into it from
the top end of the feeding pen. This division
kept the sleeping quarters dry and clean,
and dry grass or corn husks were put in for
bedding. On a cold or wet day, and on winter
nights, the pigs covered themselves com-
pletely with this bedding, Especially the
young ones. Now and again the dirty portion
was cleaned out, and either burnt or used
for mulching round trees.
By this layout the shed provided shade
in the hottest weather, and the pigs got all
the sun they needed at other times. For
roof we used bark. I prefer that to anything
else.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department:)
(1) Best balanced ration for milking
cows when lucerne, bran, linseed meal and
natural grasses (sparse in winter ) are
available f Average production per cow, 21
gallons per dap. (2) Bercentagc of bone-
meal and salt to make mineral nurture and
quantitg per head per dap ?—1011.
(1) September to April: Green lucerne, up
to 751 b,; bran. 41b.; linseed meal, 41b daily,
with available pasture. May to August: Dry
lucerne chaff, 201 b.; bran, 41b.; linseed meal.
41b. (2) A lick containing equal parts of
common salt and bonemeal is used for milk
cows with very good results. The above
ration is, however, rich in calcium and phos-
phorus, and bonemeal may not therefore be
required in (lie lick. Common salt should
be supplied. Minerals are best supplied as a
lick and not in the feed.
(1) Length, and time of paspalum seed
harvesting season in N.S.W ? (2) Weekly
earnings of average worker? ' (3) Is it heavy
work? (4) Experience necessary? (5)
Districts where seed is harvested? (6)
Address of likely employers? —GOG.
(1) Season extends from January to May,
the main period being February, March and
April. (2) Labor is employed at piecework
rates, usually from 3d. to Gd. per pptitid. The
picker may lease areas from a : farmer for
harvesting seed, or may join a gang of
pickers working for a lessee. (3) and (4)
Experienced pickers can harvest up to 2001 b.
seed per day under good- conditions. The
work is light and little . experience is re-
quired. (5) In many North Coast districts.
Macksville, Kempsey, Goff’s JJnrbor, Rich-
mond River and Tweed River, being - repre-
sentative. (6) Branch secretaries of the
Primary Producers’ Union should be able
to supply information.
(1) Best means of destroying tea-tree?
Would poisonous spray he effective? (2)
1 wish to produce seed from wild white
clover and rye grass for broadcasting. These
grasses having been sown, how and when
would the seed be ready for harvesting? (3)
Approximate yield per acre, with no manures,
grown on average sandy hill country in
East Oippsland; rainfall, 22in.f— 064.
(1) A roller similar to those used for
rolling down mallee scrub might: be tried on
large areas. Chemical sprays are not likely
to be effective. (2) The usual method of
harvesting white clover is to mow it, allow
it to cure and then put it through a special
clover dehuller. It is sufficient for farm
purposes to flail, winnow and sift it. A
held should be mown as soon as the flower
heads are brown, and fairly dry and the pods
well filled with plump seed. The sward
should be kept short by grazing or mowing
until mid-December, when the clover will
run to seed without competition from other
plants. Perennial rye grass may be harvested
with a reaper and binder, cured and
threshed, or stripped with an ordinary
stripper and winnowed, or. for farm pur-
poses, cut with a mower, cured and the seed
flailed out. It is usually ripe for stripping
in late December or early January when the
seed at the tips of the ears strips easily
between the fingers. On account of the fre-
quent summer rain, it wmuld probably be
better to cut and thresh the rye grass than
to strip it in the field. A very inferior
sample results if stripping is undertaken
during, or is followed by, w’et weather.
Pamphlet on harvesting is obtainable from
Vic. Agriculture Department. (3) White
clover does not persist in Vic. in areas
receiving less than 80in. rain, so no esti-
mate of yield is possible. A 22in. rainfall
is about the lowest limit at wdiich perennial
rye grass will persist. Grown as a special
crop, a harvest of about 10 bushels might
be obtained in the first year. Rainfall
maps indicate the average in your district
as 82in.. not 22in. With an annual aver-
age of 32in.., yields of 150 to 200 pounds
per acre may be expected from pure stands
of white clover, and 15 to 20 bushels from
pure rye grass stands.
(1) Would poultry-farming near Hobart
( Tas .), be a profitable enterprise? (2)
Considering general local demand and
supply how many fowls would be warranted?
(3) Is egg export from Hobart likely to be
profitable? (4) What capital pet' 500 birds
is necessary to start? (5) Feeding expense
per year per 500 birds? —3B.
(1) It should be possible to show a profit
of about 2s. Gd. p.a. for each laying bird kept.
(2) 500 to 1000. (3) Doubtful, but it is
possible that the export of eggs during the
glut season would help to stabilise the local
market. (4) £5OO. (5) Approximately
£2OO.
(1) Names of wholesale buyers of table
ducks in Melbourne? (2) Average price
obtainable throughout the year? (3) Is
there a steady market? (4) Best type of
green feed? (5) Name of a book on duck-
brecding ? —798.
(1) E. Watt and Co., Flinders-lane, and
Ash Bros., Spencer-street, City; Brian and
Co., Toorak-road, South Yarra. (2) and
(3) Prices show very great fluctuations and
it is doubtful if producers have found this
branch of the business profitable for some
time. From July to December, 1931, prices
w-ere: Muscovy drakelings, 7s. to ,125.; ordi-
nary ducklings, 4s. Gd. to 7s. Gd.. From
January to June, 1932: Muscovy drakelings,
7s. to 10s.; ordinary ducklings, 4s. Gd. to
ss. Gd., all per pair. (4) Green oats,
barley, berseem clover, lucerne and silver
beet. (5) “Ducks,” from Robertson and
Mullens.
Best feed to stimulate egg-laying? —4Bo.
Take one part by measure of a good grade
wheatmeal to tw r o parts of bran, or, where
a good quality of pollard is available, two
parts of this to one part of bran; add
7 p.c. to 10 p.c. of good grade meat-
meal by wmight of the entire mixture.
The above may be fed in dry or wet form,
and in either ease a quantity of meat-meal
may be placed in a separate receptacle and
left for the birds to pick as they desire.
If ovarian disorders occur, .such as protru-
sion of the oviduct, it is an indication that
the ration is of too forcing a nature, and
the amount of animal food should be re-
duced. When fed moist the mixture should
be made appetising by moistening with skim-
milk or boiling water, and then mixed until
in a crumbly condition. For the evening
meal wlieat, when available, should be the
staple grain, but mix oats and maize with
it. During cold wmatlier the grain ration
may consist of at least one-third maize but
iu hot weather this should be given in less
quantity. The manner in which the birds
appreciate the different kinds of grains must
be taken as a guide. When it is observed
that they are leaving a particular grain this
should be given in reduced quantity. Give
more food at the evening meal than the birds
require, for if the grain is fed in litter they
will have something to scratch for in the
early morning. Green food, such as chaffed
lucerne, clover, green oats, silver beet, cab-
bage, etc., should be fed during the day.
The birds should be given as much food as
they wall eat at each meal. In addition to
generous feeding, gravel, grit, crushed oyster
or other sea shell and clean water should be
always before the birds.

HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Beady” : For ringworms on animals try
clipping the hair well round affected patch
and paint daily with a mixture of three
parts petrol to one part tincture of iodine
for about four days.
“McNoon”; For cleaning down impervious
floors of cowbails, yards, etc., take a worn-
out motor tyre, cut a strip 2ft. 6in. by 4in.
from under the tread and trim it to about
lin. in thickness. Take two pieces of hard-
wood, 2t't. Gin. by 3in. by lin., and place
piece of tyre between them, leaving its
bottom edge protruding about 3 lin. below
bottom of pieces of wood. Nail pieces of
wood and tyre together; trim protruding
tyre fairly thin near edge; bore hole through
pieces of wood and fix handle exactly as on
a stable broom. Use as such.
“C.G.8.”: “Kripple’s” advice on driving-
belts (B. 29/6/’32) and his warning against
plastering sticky stuff which tears the belt
joins apart are opportune, but why is it only
engineers who recognise the value- of castor
oil on a driving-belt? In a career extend-
ing from the Riverina and the Malice to the
Wimmcra, I’ve only found one cocky who
used it. Personally I would just as soon
think of taking the harvester out without
lubricant as without castor oil. Here in the
Wimmera it costs from 9s. to 10s. a gallon,
and a gallon should last on the average farm
belt work three years- Cheap insurance
against w 7 aste fuel through belt slip, and
you’ve got soft, pliable, well-preserved belts
as well. Scrap (or, better still, realize on)
the belt-tighteners on your harvester, thereby
removing unnecessary strain from the bear-
ings, and just run a trickle of castor on
the pulley face every dinner-time.
“Kaihiku”: Men on the land like to do
a bit of repairing and stitching with hemp,
needles and black wax, but many find
it hard to make a proper thread. A
saddler or shoemaker gives the hemp a rub
with fingers on apron, breaks one strand a
little longer than the next and twists the four
strands into a thread, Take a ball of hemp
and practise breaking the single strand until
perfect. Beeswax melted with one-third part
of resin makes a good wax; harness-oil does
not affect it. Just 24in. from the end of
tapered point of thread, run needles two or
three times through thread, then put end of
thread through eye of needle and pull
through. It will not come off until the job
is done.
“Mulyan” : When fencing across a swamp
the best timber to use for posts is matured
tea-tree. If other timber is used, tar _ the
butts and, as the posts have to be driven
in, sharpen them on the flat sides, but don’t
point them. The best fence is a toprail and
three Avires.
“Yarri”: If there are stumps in the corn-
field that are hard to get rid of, don’t burn
the husks at the barn, as is commonly done.
Cart them to the stumps and burn them
there. For the most stubborn, dig away a
bit of the ground at one side to get the
fire under the roots.
“Culgoa Lass”: When calves are allowed
to run with station milking cows they at
times refuse to drink while their dams are
in the bails. If the calves are weaned
the cows will probably dry off. To prevent
this let the calves run with the cows,
but put a muzzle on them —a piece of light
board, 6 ; n. to Sin. by 4in., with on the long
side a slot that will clip on the inner part
of the nose. The slot is cut from the top
midway across the board, gradually widen-
ing as it gets towards the centre. The
muzzle prevents a calf sucking its mother
and permits it to drink water.
“Rab”: Wheat-farmers whose crops are
being damaged by rabbits should use the
poison cart, with pollard and phosphorus.
Nothing is quicker in laying out large
numbers of rabbits in the winter and it gets
the kittens, too. After running the poison
cart thoroughly, it pays to plough in all
burrows within 15 chains of a crop. Most
horses will not face rabbit warrens, but
can be driven over them blindfold. A
bullock team does the work without trouble.
“A.W.”: “Mulgo” (B. 13/7/’32) suggests
that roof guttering should be painted on the
inside; but don’t use a lead paint for a job
like that. If you do there is danger of lead
poisoning should the water be used for
drinking.
, “Wi”; Don't throw away worn-out files.
Cut down on an emery-wheel they make
good chisels or hoofcutters.
“Dimon” : If you want to split an earthen
drain-pipe, fill it tightly with sand and tap
along it from end to end with a cold chisel.
Repeat on the opposite side; then, with a
blow or two of the hammer, it will fall
a P ai 't along the lines you have marked.
"Sylvester”; To those cooking pig-feed a
40-gallon petrol drum, opened on its side
and bricked in, is useful. Open on the oppo-
site side to plug; brick in on two sides
with chimney at back. Have two old tines
made into half-circles to fit drum, and
turned out at ends to rest on top of brick
walls. Keep the water above fire-line to
increase its life, and when it burns out a
new one can be dropped in. This will
save firewood and is safer than an open fire.
“Gumblegubbin”; To make a simple and
attractive rustic gate with light, round
timber, use for the centre rail a piece that
has a good fork, and fit the prongs into
the hinge end of the gate, either in bored
holes or mortise holes. This acts as a stay,
arid, if dowelled, the gate will never sag.
A rail with lighter forks may be used above
and below it to even the spaces with the
prongs in the headpiece.
“Reefton”: A Riverina farmer has proved
that, save for sugar, tea and the like, you
can live well on things grown on the farm.
His breakfast consists of crushed-wheat
porridge, with bacon or ham and eggs, and
bread (made from wholemeal flour). For
dinner there is mutton, beef, veal, lamb, pork
or poultry, with vegetables (grown in great
variety) and stewed, preserved or cooked
dried fruit from the orchard, with junket and
cream. For tea there is meat again, with
wholemeal scones, and, in season, tomatoes
and cucumbers, strawberries and cream, with
jam and cheese. I have mentioned tea, but
the family prefers “coffee” made by mixing
whole-wheat flour with treacle and salt, roast-
ing and powdering it. All home-grown, with
the exceptions mentioned; and the farmer,
at 64, still has his own teeth and hair, and
can do a day's work with anyone, while his
three sons are not only good workers but
are stars in their district football team.
“Tenrag”: With a herd of 2000, J. J.
Paterson, of Taranaki, is ihe biggest dairy-
farmer in M.L. He farms over 10,000 sheep
as well.
“GG6”: The introduction of Zebu blood
to the North Queensland cattle stations (B.
13/7/’32) is no new thing. It is nearly
20 years since a well-known N.Q. cattle-
man and shipper of horses to India
made a large-scale experiment, importing 100
Zebu bulls from India. These proved
immune from tick-induced red-water, but it
was observed that as the cross got further
away from the Zebu blood, the degree of
immunisation lessened. Even to-day there
is a considerable amount of Zebu blood in
some of the N.Q. mobs, and the breed has
the advantage of maturing early, one which
appeals especially in that young beef is
becoming fashionable in the markets. One
disadvantage of the Zebu was found to be
his wildness. Though tame as a sheep in
his native land, the emigrant when turned
out in large paddocks and seeing little of
human beings, speedily became as wild as
a hawk. As the beast is as fast and agile
as a deer, jumping ordinary fences in his
stride, this proved an annoyance to stock-
owners, adding, as it did, considerably to
the work of mustering.

After the war a movement was set on foot
for tlie return of Jews to Palestine. (1) How
has it progressed? (2) 'How many are there
now? (3) Have they any part in the gov-
ernment of the country? —B4B.
(1) The Zionist organisation sent Jews
from parts of Europe to Palestine long before
the war, 1 but the Balfour Declaration at the
end of it began the real resettlement.
GJ) Before the war there were fewer than
50,000 Jews in Palestine; there are now
172,000 as against 588,000 Moslems (Arabs
mainly) and 83,000 Christians. (3) Owing
to the preponderance of Arabs the British
Government has not been able to give popu-
lar government; the country is governed by
an Administrator and an Appointee Council.
The Vaad Lemmi looks after Jewish affairs.
Owing to an inrush which the country was
unable to absorb a quota of immigrants is
fixed annually. Jews have drained swamps,
reafforested large tracts of country with
Australian gums (known in Palestine
as “the Jewish tree”), and rid their own
areas of malaria, formerly the scourge of the
country; have established manufactures,
augmented the country’s trade 500 per
cent, and set up a university.

in captivity? (2) flow many eggs do they
lay? (3) Does the cock bird sit in turn
with the hen? (4) How long do the eggs
take to batch? (5) Any special treatment
required in rearing the young? —7s4.
(1) Yes. (2) Seven. (3) Generally rim
hen only sits. (4) Four weeks. (5) Treat
as young turkeys—plenty of green food,
boiled and chopped up liver, dry toast crusts
and crushed up wheat and maize. Pass all
this through a mincing machine. The liver
should be apportioned—one of liver to ten
parts of other food.
(1) Why can’t the U.B.A. put the gold
it has collected to legitimate use f (2) It
is stated that the U.B.A. cannot balance its
budget, yet some say it should, cancel
war debts. Isn’t, this inconsistent? (3)
Who is withdrawing the gold from TJ.B.A. at
present, and why? (4) Is Prance facing
depression, unemployment, etc,, to the same
extent as U.S.A.? (5) How did France
accumulate so much gold, seeing it owes so
much in war debts? —s4l.
(1) Its foreign trade is dwindling, largely
because it insisted on payments in gold from
debtors instead of taking them in goods
Dwindling, trade involves reduced credit, no
matter now much gold a country has in its
vaults. (2) Those in America who advance
the argument that the U.S.A. should cancel
war debts regard this as the only means
whereby the country can regain ‘ its lost
foreign trade; which, as events seem to be
showing, is mjich more valuable than anv
advantages accruing from the influx of gold
from debtor nations. ) Gold is being
withdrawn from New York in favor of Lon-
don and other banking centres because de-
positors reckon they can get better terms
elsewhere. (4) Exact means of comparison
are not available. Probably France, having
a thriftier population, is suffering less than
the U.S.A. (5) During the period of the fall
of the franc, France made heavy investments
abroad. When the franc was stabilised, and
the working costs of French industry were
brought down to below the level of most of
the rest of the world, these investments were
withdrawn, in gold, there being much more
profitable employment for the money at home.
(1) In what parts of the world is red
snow to he found? (2) What causes it?
(3) Name of any scientist who has recorded
seeing red snow?- —080.
(1) Many, among them the Forbidden
Plateau, on Vancouver Island, British Colum-
bia. (2) Color is due to the presence of in-
numerable microscopic plants. (3) W. 8.
Bruce tells of seeing “acres of red snow and
ice” on Spitsbergen and Nova Zambia, as well
as on the South Orkneys in the Antarctic.
Charles Darwin saw red snow in the Andes.

(1) Can “show” carnations be raised from
seed? (2) Varieties worth trying? (3)
When to sow seed? —9B9.
(1) Yes, if you are prepared to pay a
big price for the seed. (2) Chabaud’s strain
(10s. per oz.), Giant Malmaifean (ss. per
joz.) and an Australian-saved seed (2s. 6d.
and 3s. (id. per packet). (3) Sow in August
in shallow boxes and place in a liot-house
to assist germination, transplanting to other
boxes when plants have four leaves. They
must not be grown in shady positions, the
soil must be well limed and the plants
staked or wired to protect them from damage
from wind.
(1) How to treat clumps of dahlia bulbs,
and when to divide them? (2) How to keep
vermin away from them?— 96s.
(1) Dig up the clumps and store them in a
dry place. Leave the soil attached to- them;
it will fall off when it dries. Divide the
clumps when the tubers start in growth
about November, and cut them carefully so
that each tuber has a neck with a shoot.
(2) Dust with equal parts of lime and
tobacco-dust.
How to charge a six-volt battery off a 12-
volt d.c. generator? —942.
Connect the positive generator terminal
to the positive accumulator terminal and
the negative generator terminal to one end
of a resistance, the other end being joined
to the negative accumulator terminal. The
value of the resistance is determined by the
desired charging rate. If the generator
is delivering the full voltage, then, for 2
amps, rate it is 3 ohms; for 4 amps, it is
1.5 ohms and for 0 amps.. 1 ohm. In
each case the resistance must be able to
carry the specified current. Start up the
generator before connecting the accumu-
lator.
History, area and population of the Tannu-
Tura Republic?— 97o.
It is a republic under Soviet protection,
to the north-west of Mongolia. The terri-
tory formed part of the Chinese Empire
until 1912, but soon after the advent of the
Chinese Republic it became independent.
It was proclaimed a Russian protectorate
after the outbreak of war in 1914, but dur-
ing the Russian Civil -War of 1919-20 passed
again under Chinese jurisdiction. The
Chinese were driven out in 1921 after a
Soviet system of government had been set
up. Area is about 64,000 acres. Popula-
tion about 62,000.
A, B, C and D arc, playing cribbage. 1 i
leads a nine; G, who has a pair of nines,
makes the play 18 with a. pair. What odds
cap G estimate there are against D hold-
ing the remaining nine? —9l4.
Three nines are known to be out —two in
C’s hand, one in B’s. It is known also that
A has none. If the deal is a six-card one
there are 34 unknown cards, including D’s.
The chances against finding a nine in D’s
hand are therefore 34 to 6.
(1) Another player and I use a conven-
tion in bidding at auction bridge. If we
are partners and either of us holds a hand
containing three quick tricks we call two of
our longest suit. If the partner holds one
quick trick ho converts to no trumps. Other
players have objected. Is our convention
allowable? (2) What is the definition of a
“quick trick”? (3) Of a convention? 968.
(1) You can adopt any convention you
like, hut your system means over-biddin<-
In a major suit you need at least five trumps
or four very strong ones, irrespective of
outside suit. (2) Ace or k.q. (3) A pre-
arranged basis of bidding. You can’t make
a new convention with cards in your hand.
In answer to a query regarding the Great
I'Jastern (B. l/6/’32), you state “she in-
volved Jier succeyswe owners v in a los*
of over £1,000,000.” ' Doebn’t this estimate'
overlook the successful laying of Atlantic
cables?-. — 1012.
Our authority is W. S. Lindsay's “History
of Merchant Shipping,” which says, “Even
the work of laying cables was not remunera-
tive, for, by a report of the directors issued
in 1869, it appeals that the ship had been
arrested for a debt of £35,000, and that
current expenses had considerably exceeded
receipts.” This refers to the laying of the
Atlantic cables in 1805 and 1800. After the
laying of two other cables in 1870, Lindsay
remarks, “the loss up to this period
amounted to close on £1,000,000.” Two
small cable-laying contracts in 1873-74 and
1875, which just about paid expenses, con-
cluded the ship's career, and she involved
her owners in more expense before they
were done with her.
What docs “post impressionism” as applied,
to art mean?- —lOO3.
The term was invented by the art-critic
Roger Fry about 1910 to describe all the
artistic reactions from impressionism. It
covered the works of such men as Cezanne,
Van Gogh, Gauguin, Matisse, Picasst and
the cubists and signifies merely that they
came after the impressionists.
Is it correct to use the expression 12 p.m.
when referring to the twelfth hour after
noon? —840.
No. It is neither a.m. nor p.m., but
midnight; exactly opposite the noon
meridian.
Best time for setting waratah seeds and
method of sowing? —774.
Sow in spring one inch deep in a shallow
box containing coal ashes, from which dust
and clinkers have been sifted away. When
the seedlings are large enough to handle,
remove to small pots containing soil similar
to that in which the dowers are found grow-
ing naturally.
(1) How much tea and coffee arc con-
sumed per head of population yearly in
N.8.W.? (2) Where does the bulk of our
tea come from nowadays? (3) Where did it
mainly come from before the war? (4)
From what countries do we import coffee? —
1031.
(1) Average annual consumption is about
711 b. tea and jib. coffee per head. (2) For
the three years ended June, 1031, the Nether-
lands East Indies supplied 49 p.c.; Ceylon
41 p.e., India 7 p.c. and China 3 p.c. (3)
For the three pre-war years, 1911-13, Nether-
lands East Indies supplied 13 P.c.; Ceylon
58 p.c.; India 20 p.c.; and China 9 p.c.
(4) Mainly from the Netherlands East
Indies and India.
(1) Must all N.B.W. employers insure
their employees with an insurance co. under
the N.S.W. Workers' Compensation Act?
(2) What protection is afforded those who
take out such policies against the possibility
of the companies going broke? —lo39.
(1) The Act prescribes that every em-
ployer must insure with a licensed insurer
against his liability to pay compensation,
unless he is authorised by the N.S.W.
Workers’ Compensation Commission to
undertake the liability on his own account.
(2) Insurers transacting workers’ compen-
sation business must obtain a licence from
the commission, and must deposit with the
State Treasurer a sum of £6OOO or £lO,OOO
according to premium income as a guarantee
that compensation payments will be met when
due. .;Self-insurers must deposit an amount
determined by the commission.
(1) Could I receive 3 LO, Melbourne, on
a crystal receiver at a distance of 150 miles
by using a dry battefy or some other small
addition to the set? (2) If not, would a
two-valve set be satisfactory? —ll4.
(1). Might be possible to hear 3LO very
weakly at night under favorable conditions,
but a crystal set at this distance would be
unsuitable as a means of entertainment.
(2) A two-valve would give headphone
strength at night, but 3LO would not be
heard during the day.
Best method of (1) watering and (21
feeding pot plants? (3) When to repot, and
soil most suitable? —974.
(1) Immerse the pots twice a week at
this time of the year (every second day
in summer) in a tub of water. (2) Weak
liquid cow manure to which is added a little
soot. (3) Should be done not later than
August in a mixture of loam (preferably
virgin soil), rotted cow manure and m little
sand. Mix it thoroughly together and, after
putting in crocks to allow drainage, press
in a little soil, then put in the plants, and
finally pack in the soil to within half an
inch of the top.
(1) How to tell lithographs from line-
engraved stamps? (2) Particulars and value
of new 2d. found among the remainders of
the Samoan “Express ” issue? —94o.
(1) The impression of a lithograph often
has a shiny, greasy appearance caused by
the sliding pressure in printing. On a line-
engraved stamp the ink stands out above
the level of the paper. (2) Just prior to
the closing of the “Express” P.O. at the
end of 1881, a consignment of stamps
reached Apia. Included in the stocks was
a new 2d. which was never put into circula-
tion. It has no special value.
What licence fees are paid to the Govern-
ment by Victorian registered racecourses and
what do they amount to annually ?—lo7s.
The fee is £L p.a., plus 3 ,p.c. of gross
revenue in most cases. Where grbss revenue
is less than £l5OO but more than £6OO, 2 p.c.
is taken; on £6OO or less, no percentage is
charged. Receipts in 1929 were £24,952;
1930, £27,789; aud 1931, £23,246.
(1) From what M.L. trees or shrubs can
brown dye be extracted? (2) Method of
extraction ? —742.
(1) Most suitable is the species of cop-
rosma, known as karamu. (2) Make a
solution of the bark and immerse fabric in
it. On boiling for an hour a very fine brown
color is produced, fast to light and washing.
Articles on the subject appear in “N. Z.
Journal of Agriculture,” August and Sep-
tember, 1917, and June, 1918, and “N. Z.
Journal of Science and Technology,” Sep-
tember and November. 1938.
(1) I have a 2in. Worthington centri-
fugal pump which is to be belt-driven by a
motor, normal speed 350 r.p.m Normal
speed of pump is 1645 r.p.m., and the pump
pulley is Sin diameter. What diameter
pulley will I require on the engine? (2)
Method of calculation? —lll3.

DOPE
BY
GRANTLEY LORRENS.
Synopsis: Ernest William Johns,
M.A. Oxon., cocaine addict and desti-
tute, saves Etty Smith from a
half-breed’s knife in a Sydney water-
front “ dive.” Aboard the Surf
Queen, " he accepts her father’s offer
of a job, and Etty helps him to fight
his craving. As she tends him Johns
realises that she loves him. At Lola
Rang a Fay Campbell, or* at cruise in her
father’s steam yacht, Arethusa, visits
Etty—and Johns meets his ideal. That
night, inspired by Varley, one-time
medical student, now the cook, who
loves Etty, Johns deserts, stow-
ing away in the Arethusa’s life-boat.
He hears Fay discuss him, and she
scarcely conceals her interest in him
from her father. Racked by his crav-
ing, Johns sneaks ashore at Zandavar
to Varley’s friend, Wooden Charlie,
ivho gives him dope and, later, a job.
Meeting Fay ostensibly by accident
before she sails, Johns confesses his
weakness: she is sure he will con-
quer it. To, give Johns an opportunity
of concentrating on writing his “great
book,” Charlie is arranging to sell
his joint when a drink-crazed Yankee
shoots him. The place catches fire.
Johns drags Charlie’s body from the
ruins. Blindly escaping from the
crowd, he is attacked by but shoots a
garrotter. Johns collapses into a
house. Flora, who keeps it, persuades
Captain Gibbons, whom she has refused
to marry, to take licr and Johns aboard
the Spindrift. Eight months pass.
The strain of looking after Johns,
now cured, has taken toll of Flora—
she is consumptive. A storm is work-
ing up.
book hi—the spindrift.
Chapter I ( Continued .)
JOHNS had steadfastly refused to let her
see the uncompleted manuscript. ‘‘l
want to give you a surprise,” he had
told her at every plea that she had made.
“It’s just like a painting. If you see it in
stages, it takes away the illusion of the
whole.” He shook his head and wagged his
finger at her playfully. “Not 'til it’s
finished, young”
He broke off as Flora suddenly laid her
hand tremulously on his arm. “Johnny,”
she said, “I don’t think I’ll be able to waif
until it’s finished.” Her pupils had sud-
denly grown big with an imponderable
fear. “Johnny dear, I have a feeling”
She stopped suddenly. She had not
meant to say anything like that. She had
been hoping to conceal her fears; to keep
them to herself, at least until his book was
written. She knew that once he had got
an inkling of her dread he would not rest
until he had got her to some port where
she could get attention—and she desper-
ately wanted Johnny to finish the book.
She wanted to see it an accomplished fact
before she gave in. But the brooding
menace of the coming storm had weakened
her self-control. Two or three times lately
she had longed to tell Johns of her premoni-
tion. The idea of death frightened her;
but always she had kept her inclination on
the leash. What good would it have done?
What if she did get another two or three
months of life? Beyond worrying Johns,
and keeping him from his book, the voic-
ing of her fears—her certainty, rather—
would have done no good. And now !
“My dear!”
Johns was looking at her in dismay. And
the barriers were down—the soul of the
girl was in her violet eyes, and the revela-
tion astounded him. With a quick, impul-
sive gesture he took her hand.
“My dear, why didn’t you tell me before?
God, what a blind fool I’ve been. You’ve
been slipping away in front of my eyes,
and I’ve been too absorbed in that damned
book to notice it! We’re going to get back
to land as quickly as we can. And then
I’m going to take you to the nearest moun-
tain, where you can get better again. But
first I’m going to marry you.”
Flora pushed his hand away. Her
breath was coming quickly, and two red
spots showed startlingly against the pallor
of her cheeks.
“You’re talking rot, Johnny, utter rot.
It’s this damnable weather. It’s making
you mad—making both of us mad.” She
gave a little gasp that was meant to be a
laugh. “Storm-madness! You and I—
two sensible people—going on like nincom-
poops!” She shook her head in exaspera-
tion. “Damn this weather! It plavs devil-
ish tricks!”
“Flora”—Johns had her chin in his slim
fingers—“ Flora, it was only an hour ago I
agreed with Gibbons that you didn’t love
me.”
“And neither I do!” The girl’s eyes
flashed angrily, and she stamped her foot.
But the motif was not lost on Johns. It
was. anger at her own self-betrayal that lay
behind the gesture.
He smiled slowly. “We’re going to get
married,” he repeated.
“We’re not!”
Her tone was vehement. She was fight-
ing her own desires. The years in Zandavar
had not smudged out her decency. She
was not going to drag Johns down; she
would not let him tie, however willingly—
eagerly even—a millstone round his neck.
She loved him too much for that.
“We’re not!” she repeated. “There’s
only one man on this earth that I’d marry,
and that’s dear old Steve. I only wish I’d
had the courage”—the word slipped out
before she could check it—“to do it long
ago!”
Johns smiled again. “We’ll see about
that,” he promised her gently. “We’ll see
about that when the storm’s gone.”
A low roll of thunder came to them across
the waters. It was the first earnest. Flora
shivered, and for a moment she leaned
against him.
“Oh, Johnny!” she whispered, like a
frightened child. “Johnny—darling!”
The last word came to him as she braced
herself, and turned towards the saloon. It
had been so low, the merest suggestion of
a whisper, that he could not convince him-
self that it had had any actuality.
Chapter 11.
Noon found the Spindrift still plodding
leaden-footed on her nightmare race against
time. To the anxious people watching the
horizon it seemed that she did not move.
She was stuck fast, impotent, immobile, in
the gluey ocean; and the haunting lines of
Coleridge kept running through Johns’s
mind:
All in a hot and copper sky
The bloody sun, at noon,
Right up above the mast did stand
No bigger than the moon.
Well, it was something, he reflected
grimly, to be in a position to see eye to
eye w r ith one of the poets. There was that
much satisfaction. The Ancient Mariner
had certainly not exaggerated that much
of his tale.
“We’re going to make it, aren’t we?”
It was Flora who spoke! she was looking
at Gibbons eagerly, as though to hypnotise
from him the answer that she wished.
Another growl of thunder followed menac-
ingly on her words. It was as though the
elements had heard the question. Grim
and menacing, it rumbled across the water,
as though ricocheting in low parabolas,
held down against its will by the weight ot
the leaden atmosphere. They could almost
/ancy that a tremor ran through the whqle
ship as the thunder reached her. And,
nearly invisible, a mere painful impression
to the eyes, a flicker of lightning ran along
the horizon. It gave Johns a shock of fear.
There was something so sinister in the
danger signal, something so appalling in
its very momentariness; “like a snake half-
seen in the grass,” he told himself; a thing
of hidden venom, waiting for the oppor-
tunity to strike.
There was no need for Gibbons to answer
the girl’s inquiry. But there was that in
his eyes as he looked at her that made her
cry out sharply:
“Don’t, Steve dear—anybody would think
it was your fault!”
Her voice was suddenly high with hys-
teria, and the staccato words rang out in
the stillness that had followed the thunder.
The kanaka at the wheel stared uneasily at
her, and furtively made the sign with
which his ancestors had called upon their
gods to help them. The kanaka was a
Christian, a mission boy, but he failed to
see how the Big White God who, his men-
tors had taught him, made all the storms,
could also be expected to save them from
the results of His handiwork. It was a silly
idea, having only one God. How could one
God be expected to be all things, at all
times, to all men?
Gibbons and Johns also stirred uneasily.
The girl’s voice had had a note of terror in
it that was more than physical. It was as
though she had seen the coming of the end
of her world, and was afraid to look beyond.
Again the lightning flickered on the
horizon; but this time it was a sheet of
white flame that rivalled the sun.
They suddenly found the mate at then-
side ; to Johns, who, for one, had not noticed
his approach it seemed that he. was a genie
conjured by the lightning—a genie of bad
omen judging by his words.
“Barometer’s right ' down.”, he informed
Gibbons morosely. “If there was a 'Cata-
i 'v'lT'" on the dial she’d be registering
there.”
Stephen. Gibbons
shrugged. There was
nothing to be done
but wait. There was
no chance now of
reaching Kai-Moroa.
Not the vaguest.
Another half-hour at
the most—they could
not hope for more
than that.
A sudden anxiety
for his manuscript
sent Johns, with a
muttered excuse, to his
cabin; that must be
protected at all costs.
The mate returned to his post by the
wheel, and Gibbons and Flora were lelt
alone at the rail watching the horizon.
“Life’s a funny problem, Steve.” She
leaned over the rail and stared down at
the sullen water as though expecting to find
the solution there. “It’s only when you see
the end of it in sight that you begin to think
about it much. You just seem to go on
and on until then, not bothering very
much about anything. Although I suppose
it’s just as well really. It’s hell enough
without thinking, isn’t it?”
The sullen eddies along the Spindrift s
quarter absorbed in turn the attention of
the skipper. “Life’s more or less what you
make it,” he said at length.
The girl laughed sharply, but without
amusement. “If you’d said that at any
other time, I might have believed you!
But now”—she waved one hand at the
horizon. “It doesn’t hold water, Steve
dear, that idea. You’ll be telling me next
that it was you who made this cursed
weather!”
Gibbons shook his head. “It’s not the
weather that counts,” he told her. “It’s
the way you face it.' You can only do your
best to keep your head:above water. And
even if you do drown, you can at, least go
down lighting. That gives you a chance to
come up again.” - /
“Then I suppose you’d say that he went
down fighting?”
There was no need ,to say who “he” was.
“Of course he did.. You don’t think it
would have been like him to have given in
weakly, do you? I’ll bet he fought every
inch of the way. - And I’ll bet not many
have had a harder struggle! The more
brains land education: .people have the more
capacity for suffering they have, Flora girl.”
Flora nodded. “We’re not fools our-
selves,' Steve. But we’re : not in the same
street with Johnny when it comes to brains.”
“Nor education either. I don’t reckon,
Flora, that we’ve got any idea of what he’s
been through—especially in Sydney.”
The sullen water again absorbed the
girl’s attention. - “Bid he ever say anything
to you about Fay?” she asked casually.
“Not particularly. He mentioned her.
She was the jane whose father had the
yacht, wasn’t she? Why?”
“Oh, nothing.” Her voice was still
casual. She watched the occasional flecks
of froth dissolve back into their parent
water. “I was just wondering. I thought
men always talked to each other about
the women they love.”
Gibbons studied her profile with sudden
eagerness. This was news to him. It had
never entered his mind that there might
be someone else, so far as Johnny w T as
concerned.
“You mean—he’s in love with that girl?”
“Yes.” The monosyllable was clipped off
suddenly, as though other words had been
about to follow it. But it was some seconds
before she added: “I think that was what
hurt him as much as anything. To know
ou love someone, and to know that you
can’t have him—her, I mean; that must
be just about the worst hell there is, don’t
you think?”
Gibbons nodded. “It is,” he said, with
meaning. “But surely,” he went on. “he
could have asked her? Or perhaps he did?”
Flora shook her head. “I wonder why
he hasn’t said anything to you about her?”
she mused,. “You’d think, after eight
months cooped up like this, that we three
would know each other from A to Z. And
yet he’s never told me a thing either,
practically, since that night at Zandavar.
These Englishmen—they know how to keep
their own counsel.”
For a while neither spoke. They watched
in silence the heavy clouds gathering on
the horizon. In the space of five minutes
it was covered by heavy black masses that
hung low over the ocean, weighed down
by, the burden that they bore. With the
precision of disciplined troops they marched
onwards towards the sun. The thunder
rumbled dully, like muffled drums urging
them on, and with ever-increasing fre-
quency came the flickering menace of light-
ning. darting hither and thither like malevo-
lent will-o’-the-wisps.
It was Flora who broke the silence. “I
wonder,” she said, musingly, “what would
have happened to Johnny if he’d married
the Smith girl? He told you about her, I
suppose?”
“More or less,” Gibbons nodded slowly.
“Enough to form an opinion on. anyway.”
He was realising that Johns had said far
more to him about Etty Smith than about
the girl Fay. There must be something in
Flora’s idea about him being-in love, after
all. “She’d have dragged him down, of
course. A man like Johnny, he
marries, has got to have a wife who can hold
her place. You see, when he gets back
home, he’ll be one of the ‘heads’ again—
professors and God knows what. It’s funny,
isn’t it, the stepping stones a man can use?”
Flora nodded. “I suppose so. I mean
that a girl not in his own class really would
hold him back , a lot.” The black clouds
passed over the sun, blotting it out like a
candle. The girl. shivered. “God, it’s
getting cold!”
The temperature had suddenly dropped
a dozen degrees or more, and from nowhere
a gust of wind smote them. It was cold
and clammy—like the hand of Death, she
thought.
Gibbons turned towards the wheel, his
face was white under its tan. The time
had come.
. Suddenly, impulsively, Flora laid her hand
on his arm. The wind was growing stronger
with every second, and already the deck
was beginning to cant so that they had to
lean against the slope of it, and foothold
was growing precarious. Flora’s hair, a
dull red in the half-light, was- blowing
across her eyes as they sought his.
“I must go,” he said, his voice rough with
anxiety. “All Hell’s going to break loose!”
The girl nodded. “And, if we come
through, Steve, I’m—going to marry you.”
Gibbons suddenly had her in his arms.
“By God, we’re coming through all right!”
His voice was throbbing. “By God, I tell
you we are! I reckon I could beat a
dozen storms now!”
He pressed his lips against hers; she
noted, with odd detachment, that his chin
was rough. She hoped that he would shave
every morning—when they were married.
Suddenly he picked her up in his arms.
“You’ve got to be stowed away safely,
darling,” he told her exultantly as he made
his way across the tossing deck to the
saloon door. Inside the threshold he set
her on her feet, and kissed her again.
“You’ll be all right, Flora girl,” he
promised. “God couldn’t let us die now,
could He?”
“No I suppose not.”
Her voice was dull, and unemotional.
But her eyes were on the clouds outside.’ A
sudden blinding flash heralded the roar
with which wind and thunder announced
the opening, in real earnest of the battle.
The slam of the door closing was lost in
the greater noise.
For' a moment Flora stood motionless,
staring, with unseeing eyes, at the door.
Then, with a little half sob, she turned and
made her way uncertainly across the saloon
to the alley way off which the cabins
opened. As she came opposite to Johns’s
door, it opened. A sudden lurch of the
Spindrift sent Flora against the opposite
wall. Johns clung to the handle of the
door.
“The storm’s come, all right!” he said
unnecessarily. “I’ve just been wondering
where would be the safest place for the
manuscript?”
As the ship swung back to a momentarily
level keel, the girl stepped into his cabin.
“I want to talk to you,” she said, and sat
down on the bunk.
Johns nodded absently. He walked to
the porthole and stared out through the
spray-misted glass across the deck. He
watched the now grey and white capped
ocean rising and falling.
He started to unscrew the port; then,
as though thinking better of it, turned
towards the girl.
“Yes?” he encouraged her.
The storm, with its imminence of death,
threw a new perspective on things. Half
an hour ago he had told her that he was
going to marry her if they reached safety.
Well, why not? That she loved him had
been made manifest. The question as to
whether the manifestation had been acci-
dental or premeditated was not of para-
mount importance. Love, marriage, suc-
cess, failure—they all achieved a new unim-
portance in the teeth of the storm.
Half a dozen or so mortals cooped up in
a tiny cockleshell of a craft. What did it
matter what their little hopes and fears
might be? The elements would soon blot
them out—and the world would still go on
as before; the surface of the ocean would
be as smooth again, and the sun as bright.
“It’s all so futile,” he said, voicing his
thoughts unconsciously.
The girl nodded. She sensed his meaning,
read his mind unerringly.
“I suppose it is. But what I wanted to
tell you was that, if ever we get out of this
storm alive, I’m going to”
Her sentence died abruptly. As the Spin-
drift lurched madly again, the heavy port,
more than half unscrewed by Johns, swung
open. She could not hear, above the bel-
lowing of the storm, the sound of the im-
pact that it made with Johns’s head; but.
with an odd sense of unreality, she watched
the .sudden vanishing of consciousness, the
abrupt dying of the aliveness of his eyes.
Then her mind threw off its anaesthesia of
horror, and, almost before he had fallen,
she was dragging his limp body across the
cabin. But it was beyond her powers to
lift him on to the bunk. After the first
effort a sharp pain in her chest gave her
warning to desist.
“No good killing yourself doing it,” she
told herself, and conquered the urge to
haul and strain and struggle in the impos-
sible task.
With a little shrug, she left Johns on the
floor while she stripped the bunk of its
blankets and mattress. These she made, into
a bed on the floor beside him. and then
gently, almost with the scientific skill of
the trained nurse, she rolled him on to it.
When she had tucked the blankets round
him, and closed the port—an effort that was
almost beyond her strength—she rescued
the manuscript from where it had fallen
from Johns’s nerveless fingers; then,, hold-

The Sugar Industry has
critics, some of them
malicious critics and most
of th e m uninformed
critics. These critics are
seeking, by presenting a
maze of figures (gener-
ally inaccurate) to sug-
gest that the Industry is
rich and greedy, unwilling
to share in Australia’s
distress.
Let us give you the simple
facts, all of which can be
verified by public docu-
ments.
Dear Fellow Australians:
In the early part of 1920 the price of Australian sugar (fixed by the Com-
monwealth) was £2l per ton. The cost of the foreign sugar landed in
Australia in the first six months of 1920 ranged from a minimum of £7B/7/3
to a maximum of £9B/12/5. The Australian grower was getting about
one-quarter of what it cost merchants to land foreign sugar, but foreign sugar
was necessary to fill Australia’s needs.
It was at this stage that the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) stepped in. *'lf
you will undertake to supply all Australia’s sugar needs,” he said, “I will
raise your price to £3O/6/8.”
The Industry accepted the obligation and is now supplying the whole of
Australia’s requirements in addition to sending more than £2,000,000 worth
of sugar overseas annually to help in paying Australian interest bills in London.
Jn 1923 the Australian price was reduced to £2 7.
Unhappily, the world’s Sugar Industry, like so many other industries, has felt
the depression. Prices of sugar are very low. Ah,’ say our mean critics, in
effect: ‘‘The world price has slumped, so the Australian price must slump, too.
It does not matter a rap to us that you stood by us when prices soared, and
that you gave us your product at about one-fourth of the cost of foreign
sugar.”
There are the facts! There is the mean story! No juggling with figures will
alter it! No camouflage will temper the ugliness of the facts!
Over 30,000 Australian families are dependent on the Sugar Industry. Destroy
the industry, as our critics want to do, and what work will be found for these
30,000 families? Destroy it in the interests of the importers of black-grown
sugar and what will happen to North Queensland now so happily settled by
a white people?
This cry of our robbing you, our fellow countrymen and women, is all bunkum,
the critics of the industry are not worrying about the Australian people. They
want to break down the policy of protection and let in the products of low-
wage countries. They are wolves in sheep’s clothing, seeking to destroy
Australian Industry in the interest of the importers.
Yours truly,
THE SUGAR GROWERS.

ing it close to her, so that it looked like
•some puny, marasmic infant, she sat on tnc
noor beside the bed, wedging her shoulders
against the bunk to steady herself in the
tossing and plunging of the Spindrift.
Chapter 111.
, F, or a singing softly to herself. But
Stephen Gibbons, ears sharpened by the
sympathy of love, could hear the tune, and
at times the words. The tune was that of
the one hymn all sailors know, but the
words, more often than not, were of her
own elaboration
The storhr was gone and with it the trim
jauntiness that had set the Spindrift apart
from the majority of her class. The sails
no longer caught the merest puff of wind,
and the sharp bow, beneath the tapering
sprit, no longer cut the waters cleanly.
r The Spindrift’s masts were both gone,
and the bow wallowed drunkenly. The
Spindrift had given herself to the storm,
surrendered herself wantonly, despite the
efforts of Gibbons and the mate, and the
storm had done with her as it would before
it left her, broken and crippled, stripped of
‘her beauty, a derelict on the still heaving
ocean. The deck sloped sharply, arid per-
petually, to the starboard rail, and the list
emphasised the hopelessness that brooded
over her. It was as though she realised her
race was run. She leaned patiently against
The ocean, waiting for it to open' its arms
'and take her to its bosom.
“Steve dear”
flora broke off abruptly from her croon-
ing as a sudden thought struck her.
Gibbons, smoking his pipe, made no answer,
but she knew that he had heard her, and
was waiting for her to go on.
“Steve, there’s no chance of us going
suddenly, is there? It seems risky leaving
him in the cabin.”
Gibbons moved over to where she sat,
back propped against the rail, and, kneeling,
t°°k her hands in his studying her eyes.
"Flora child” he said, very gently, “you’re
going to marry me, aren’t you, if ever we
iget out of this?”
> She nodded and her violet eyes searched
his questioningly. He met them calmly.
“Well, then,” he said, “tell me this—
would it mean very much to you if he
should go down?”
“Why, Steve, of course! I sort of feel
that he belongs to me.” Her voice was
jlevel, and her eyes were candor itself.
j“Don’t you see, if it hadn’t been for his
[falling up against my door that night, he
.might have gone on and on until he
dropped; and if he hadn’t found someone
•who could understand, whqm he could talk
jto, God knows what would have happened
to him! Of course, I care! I feel as
though I’m responsible for him—to Fay.”
; Her voice dropped a semi-tone with the
;last words, and for a moment she paused,
;as her eyes sought the darkling horizon.
■ Then she looked at him again, and it
[seemed to her that she was seeing him in
a new light. The strong, self-sufficient
master of the Spindrift was gone, and there
was left only the wistful man. The Spin-
drift had been all that he possessed. and
the storm had wiped that out. The Spin-
drift must, obviously, be sooner or later a
total loss. All that lie hoped for now was
that the derelict would keep them from the
water long enough for some form of rescue
to materialise.
. "Don’t you see, Steve dear,” she explained
.very softly, “heVlike a kitten that one
has found when it was starving. One can’t
help loving—in that sort of a wav, any-
how—anything that one Has helped?’
“But only like a kitten, Flora girl ? Not—
in the marrying way?”
She smiled at him, and took his stubblv
chin in her hand.
“No, not in the marrying way, Steve.
I’ve told you—and him, too!—often enough
that there’s only one man on earth that I’d
many haven’t I? Besides, Johnny has eyes for
no one and thoughts for no one but Fay.”
Gibbons sat down beside her, and for
a while they watched the purpling horizon
m silence. With the passing of the storm,
the sky had cleared, and the setting sun.
already more than half below the water’s
nm. was turning the horizon haze to a
spectrum of gauzy colors, so that it seemed
incredible that for three hours the heaven
and the ocean had met in a cataclysmal
inferno. If it had not been for the concrete
evidence of the Spindrift, derelict and
broken, the girl could have imagined she
had dreamed it all.
The sun disappeared from view abruptly,
with one last triumphant gleam that lit the
world as with a beacon—earnest of peace for
the morrow. Almost imperceptibly the
purple in the east deepened, suffusing itself
across the tranquil dome, and the stars
began to show themselves, diffidently peep-
mg from the dusk, as though loth to look
upon the derelict. Even the customary even-
ing breeze was lacking. The elements had
exhausted themselves in the afternoon, so
that they had no breath to snare, and the
subsiding ocean sobbed its penitence against
. the Spindrift’s hulk.
It. was the mate who, ten minutes later,
aroused them from their reverie.
“He seems to be waking up.” he an-
nounced as he leaned against the rail He
■ had been cooped up in the cabin with the
l!*l? n fnTiT Jo )T for ttepast hour and a
half and the stuffy air had made him lazy
indifferent whether the supercargo Jived or
dmd. The stirring of the unconscious man
...had given him the opportunity to report
• the matter and get some fresh air.
H , e , to °\ interest in the ’effect his
words had had. It was no longer a question
of master and mate. There were no more
orders to be taken, and he and Gibbons
were no better—or worse—than the kanaka
crew, or than each other. Just so many
derelicts. He brooded over his future. Jobs
were not easy to get, and he had an idea
rhat Gibbons would be broke now that the
Spindrift was broken. Not that it would
matter, probably—they would all go down
with her when she went; in a few hours,
perhaps; or in a day or so.
It was Flora who went to the cabin. Nor
would she let Gibbons accomriany her. She
know that she was the only one aboard
the Spindrift who could soothe Johnny if
the shock had done what she feared. She
had known cases before where some sudden
strain on the nerves had thrown sufferers
back—even when they had been cured for
months. She was more than expecting that
his first cry would be for cocaine. She pre-
ferred to face the crisis alone. Things
might slip out —even an unconscious ges-
ture on her part might tell Gibbons more
than she cared to have him realise.
Gibbons made no second effort to follow
her. He had started to rise when the mate
had made Ms announcement, but Flora had
been already on her feet before he had
fully taken in the import of the mate’s
words, and she had pushed him gently back
with one hand on his shoulder.
“I think Johnny would rather just me,”
she told him. “He’s sensitive—and he
might not be quite himself.”
With a shrug Gibbons had settled him-
self into a more comfortable position, and
turned his head to look at the mate.
“We can’t be far off the trade route,
Harry?”
The mate withdrew his eyes from infinity.
This was something in which to be inter-
ested, this question of their own safety. The
same idea had come to him. Allowing for
their previous change of course, the hurri-
cane, while it lasted, must have carried them
a good many miles south and the further
south they were the better their chances
of rescue. Even if the Spindrift went down,
and they were forced to take to the ocean on
whatever flotsam they could rake together,
it was better to be afloat near the trade
route than miles away from it.
“We ought to be just about in it”—he
gave this as his considered opinion. “That
was a fifty-knot blow, and it lasted for
three hours. Still and all, dead-reckoning
on that sort of data, isn’t like gospel."
Gibbons nodded slowly. His own reckon-
ing would see them just about in the path
of the larger freighters and an occasional
passenger vessel, but he had the feeling at
the back of his mind that such a thing was
too good to be true. At moments he even
caught himself wondering whether he really
wished it to be true. He was a poor man
now. He had never bothered to save—had
not bothered even to insure the Spindrift.
“When she goes, I go!” he had told more
than one eager agent, and had laughed at
them when they tried to nersuade him that
that was short-sighted policy. Oh well,
he knew now! They had been right,.after
all, and he wrong. But in those days it had
seemed a fair statement of his philosophy.
But, then, that.had been before Flora had
promised to marry him.

MIDDLE-AGE
d
Beware Age 40 When your Life
Line starts threateningly to Decline.
The average life ends at. about 55. At 40. the
pace noticeably slows —and worrying signs
appear. These tell of kidney and bladder
breakdown failure to eliminate the system’s
poison wastes, especially of uric acid. Back,
loin and groin pains appear, swollen joints
and limbs; increasing need for urination;
possibly severe inflammation of the bladder
and urinary tract: rheumatism, which cripples
and weakens the heart. Keep your kidneys
and bladder in health by taking Harrisons
Pills, the signed remedy of a London doctor.
These will free you from aches, pains, stiffness
and that growing weariness and weakness
arising from your kidney and bladder strain.
Harrison’s Pills will give you a new source
of strength and health at a time when neglect
may prove irreparable. Doctors and nurses
recommend Harrison’s Pills, while chemist:-
everywhere sell them at trifling cost.
SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The A.J.C. handicapper must have formed
a high opinion of Ramrod, a maiden three-
year-old by Spearhead—Ramson, to weight
the gelding at 7st. 51b. for the Metrop.; but
perhaps he was just taking precautions.
Anyway, Ramrod disappointed a large
number of people who took twos about his
chance in a division of the Farm Stakes at
Warwick Farm. He had every opportunity
to score if he had been good enough, but he
was a well-beaten horse at the end of a slow
seven furlongs—it took lmin. 271 secs. on a
fast track—failing even to stay that distance.
Meslia (10 to 1), a three-year-old bay geld-
ing by Moabite —-Valdivia, won from Mediator
(20 to 1), another Moabite, and Confab, who,
with some bookmakers, wound up equal
favorite with Ramrod at threes —it had been
5 to 1 bar one.
Mesha was ridden by Lightfoot, Jacko's
pilot in the Doncaster. So was Flying
Homer, winner, at sevens, of the other divi-
sion of the Farm Stakes, who cut fsec. off
Mesha’s time. Flying Ilomer, another three-
year-old, is a hay gelding by Rosewing—•
Tumbler. Behind him were Gagleigh (10 to
1). and Orbpie (6 to 1). Neither the favorite,
Rippledale, nor Kichaka, who was next in
request, was close up at the finish.
The Varroville Handicap was a good bet-
ting race and would have been still better
in that respect but for the scratching of
Gold Digger. As the barrier rose it was
4 to 1 Greensea and Dermid, 5 Cleave and
Questionnaire, 6 Anchor, 8 Orby Anthus and
Killarney. There were few inquiries for
Bert'." Why Should I come ofp the
6R6EN ?"
Gert: "Because its oangesous*
Bert ; How oo you y\o,«.<e th/vt out \
Gert:* Those players may take you
FOR THE Flag,-POLE ?"
Veneer, though Lightfoot had been engaged
by Booth, and lady punters —who generally
follow a conspicuously successful jockey on
these occasions—saw the outsider bob up,
amidst cries of “Just fancy!” and “Why
didn’t I back it?” after Questionnaire and
Orbv Anthus had contributed to an interest-
ing finish. And the tote div. was £7 Os. 6d.
for 10s.; the price in the ring was 20 to 1.
Veneer is a five-year-old bay gelding by
Valais —Sweet Lady. He was apparently
thought to be a bit above himself, and that
looked to be the matter with Greensea, who
showed great pace and then faded. Orb.v
Anthus got into a bit of trouble in the
straight; otherwise he would have been
closer.
The ladies did not neglect Lightfoot’s next
mount —Cylanta in the Homebush Handicap.
Neither did the other sex; but it was too
late- —Lightfoot’s run of luck had ended.
Greenoak (6 to 1) made a capital attempt to
repeat her Canterbury Park performance of
leading throughout. Half-way down the
straight it looked as if she must score, but
she was pipped on the post by Valparaiso,
whom Davidson rode like the star he was
in 1927. Rawn-na-Glas- —like Greenoak, sired
by the late Greenstead—was a creditable
third. Valparaiso went, out at 9 to 2. By
Valais —Lady San, he is rising nine, but he
has done no great amount of racing and will
probably last as long as his elder brother,
Fuji San. King March shaped worse for
McCartcn than for Pike. Salvador was
scratched.
The triumphant pencillers opened out a
bit in the Macquarie Grove Handicap, call-
ing 6 to 1 the field. Backed to this price
from tens Topical (Windbag—Parody)
finished a bit too well for the bottled-up Cliu-
quisaca and Port Said, and brought a wel-
come change of luck to W. Kelso, who
trains the three-year-old for Robiy. Miller.
Sunlit Reef made most of the running, but
could not come on.

In 1920 Pershore credited E. J. Watt with
the Metrop. as - a four-year-old. In 1928
Longlands, a son of Pershore, won the
V.R.C. Grand National at the same age. All
that Longlands accomplished of any conse-
quence from then until Saturday last was
to finish second in the Australian Hurdle
(1929), with 10.5. His reputation diminished
so greatly that the grandson of All Black is
weighted this year at 9st. 31b. in the Aus-
tralian Hurdle and at 9st. Sib. in the Aus-
tralian Steeplechase. Vincent O’Neill, who
prepared Spearfelt for a Melbourne Cup vic-
tory, races Longlands in conjunction with
H. L. Spry. The old gelding squeezed home
in the Boiardo Steeplechase at Moonee
Valley on Saturday, and appears to have
taken a new lease of life. In all probability
the Steeplechase will be his mission at
Caulfield.
One of the paddock fielders at “the Valley”
offered 20 to 1 against Longlands when the
betting opened, but the price shortened to
8 to 1, with Gratify favorite at 9 to 2. Apart
from Longlands, the Australian Steeple as-
pirants in the field were Ancient Mariner,
Sarocto, Tressady Rock, The Locker and
Dark Fox. If Jack Anwin had not instructed
Tagell to restrain Dark Fox in the early
stages that horse must have won. As it
was, he succumbed by a head to the strongly-
finishing Longlands. There will be nearly
li miles more ground to cover in the Aus-
tralian Steeplechase, and this ought to favor
Longlands. The Locker, though unplaced,
made a promising debut over fences. He
now is owned by Steve Murphy, trainer of
Polygonum. When he fell near the half-mile
Gratify was travelling well. A striking
feature of the race was Green Don’s achieve-
ment in leading for a considerable part of the
journey. A ring of the bit slipped through
Green Don’s mouth, and IT. J. Thompson had
a perilous ride. Green Don is a splendid
timber-topper in the making.
After being almost last in the first half
of the race. Sarocto finished a close third
to Longlands and Dark Fox. This .horse
may have been hampered by his M.L. jockey
not having ridden over the Moonee" Valley
“country” before, but in any case Sarocto
is not easy to handle. Kedale'and Farlure,
who fought out a bitter finish in the Ballatcr
Hurdle, are not engaged in the Australian
Hurdle. The favorite, Bon Haven, clouted
several of the obstacles and knocked up
coming to the home turn. His chance in the
big event on August 6 does not look at all
rosy. Makeup, the Maorilander, performed
poorly, as also did Cenlight (last year’s
Australian Hurdle winner), Bright Prince,
Kalasliie, Violinist and Yantara. As Black
Devil fell early, judgment may be suspended
in his case.
Kedale belongs to Charles Fisher, whose
father landed the first division of the
Waroona Welter with Carnardine. a massive
gelding by St. Anton. McShortodds refused
to lay better than 20 to 1 against Carnadine,
but his tote dividend was at the rate of 40
to 1. Kedale is new to the jumping game,
but more will be heard of him in that depart-
ment. He is by Crowdennis, who sired the
1931 G. N. Hurdle winner, Cockcrow. It
was only in the last stride that Carnadine
wore down J. M. Niall’s neddy Umbertana.
Latter was labelled by his trainer, Jack Holt,
whose followers needed a lot of courage to
recover their losses over Eastern Glow in
the concluding event. This daughter of
Eastern Monarch started at 10 to 9 on and
scored running away. She had greatly
improved in condition since Induna beat her
by four lengths in the V.R.C. Winter Hand!-
cap three weeks before. Easter Glow cap-
tured the Wangoom Handicap and Warr-
nambool Cup in May, and is expected to play
a prominent part in the Caulfield Cup.

Australian racing will be the poorer for
the death of the flying Greenstead, one of
the best and cheapest bargains ever picked
up at a sale of young stock. Bred by A. D.
Yuille in 1914 by The Welkin (imp.) from
Tuning Fork, he brought 100 guineas at the
yearling sales. He won £13,060 in stakes,
beginning as a two-year-old at Wyong Park
and rapidly working his way into the w.f.a.
class. His best race as a three-year-old was
the winning of the Denman Stakes, and next
year he scored several successes, including
the All-aged Stakes at Randwick. As a
six-year-oid he set the seal on his reputation,
taking the Spring Stakes at Roseliill, the
Epsom, the Craven Plate (in which he beat
Poitrel) and the V.R.C. Linlithgow Stakes. As
a sire Greenstead exceeded all expectations;'
his comparatively low-priced stock was most
successful. In his six seasons at the stud to
1931 he sired 134 winners of 257 races, their
winnings amounting to £70.721. The 1932
season, ending July 31, will show a con-
siderable increase on that amount.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Tom Luricli (14st. 21b.) was again too
lusty for Alex. Lundyn (13st. 101 b.) when
they met for the ’steentli time at Leichhardt.
Lundyn was “out” for hours after being
back-slammed in the fifth, the Russian show-
ing a supreme contempt for the rules, writ-
ten and unwritten. At the Stadium Tommy
Thompson (14st. 21b.) did nearly all the
wrestling in his match with Abe Kaplan
(lost.), but Kaplan scored the only fall.

The third and deciding Test between the
All Blacks and Australia at Sydney Cricket
Ground saw the Maorilanders triumphant by
21 points to 13, or 5 tries and 3 goals to
3 tries and 2 goals. On the day the win-
ners were far superior forward and back,
but there seems no reason for the hysteria
which a section of the Sydney press has dis-
played in describing the match. The game
was one between a side combined and shaken
down in over half a dozen big matches
and one that did not appear on the
field as a unit until the match began. The
consequences are obvious to anyone with an
elementary knowledge of Rugby football.
One may compare the opening Test in Syd-
ney. when both the teams were raw and uu-
combined. Australia on that occasion
proved the better side. A few matches later
in Brisbane the visitors showed how invalu-
able match practice is in bringing a team
on, and the lesson was driven right home ou
Saturday in Sydney. This is no disparage-
ment to the All Blacks, who showed complete
understanding and organised initiative with
which the opposition could not: cope. The
credit for the victory must go to the
forwards. Not only were they magnificent
in ruck and loose work, but they covered
up their backs in a manner that the Aus-
tralian vanguard might have emulated,
Purdue and Manchester were fine in all de-
parturients, and Solomon showed again that
the All Black wing forward is still with
us under another name. Of the backs,
Kilby at half and the flying winger Ball
played the gajie of their lives. The Aus-
tralian forwards, with occasional attractive
flashes, were all at sea most of the time.

The ninth round of the Sydney Rugby
League grade'competitions saw South Sydney
remain at the head of the table after a
narrow win by 21-17 over Newtown. It was
a close finish with victory only gained on
time. Newtown is a much improved side
this season. Other results were: St. George

Melbourne’s League matches on Saturday
were unimportant, the leading teams being
drawn against, tail-enders, though South got
a shock on the Melbourne ground. Up to
half-time the Red Legs didn’t seem to be in the
picture and reached that stage 81 points in
arrear. On resuming they staged a spell of
clever, systematic play that left South stand-
ing, put on 6 goals in a few minutes and
brought the scores level. But the effort,
spectacular and surprising, took too much
out of them and in the last quarter South
pulled itself together and managed to reach
the finish 9 points to the good—9B to Mel-
bourne’s 84. South is good, but it doesn’t
look to be a team that a man would risk
his shirt on. Robertson, Pratt and Diggins
did most to save the side’s bacon ; but the
honors of the day went to Melbourne’s
Warne-Smith, Vanthoff and Adams. The
other skirmishes were chiefly routs, Carlton
piling up ]29 to Fitzroy’s 84; Richmond
getting 85 to St. Kilda’s 54; Collingwood
94 to Hawthorn’s 70; Geelong 94 to North
Melbourne’s 50; and Footscray 82 to Essen-
don’s 69.

Bay by Joan H'ammond —who was runner-
up last year when Odette Lefebvre won —
by 6 and 5 from Miss Ebert, of the Griffith
club on the Riverina. The latter played
very line golf in the early rounds, but the
strain of the final proved too much, her
putting in particular suffering. The winner
was very solid throughout.

v ? n -vt^ e ,^ as t match of their tour the Eng-
hsh Northern Union team beat Wagga by
iS to 0. The tourists will go back well
pleased with themselves, since they have not
only won the Test rubber but have excelled
the their predecessors in the matches
with the states. At the same time, without
desiring to disparage a speedy and clever
lot, much of their success must be ascribed
to the lowered standard of the Eeague code
in both the Australian States which affect
it. It is tar below that of five years ago.

The All Blacks ended their Queensland
tour with a match against Toowoomba in
the Darling Downs dorp. They won by
30-6, though Toowoomba showed occasional
glimpses of good play. The feature of the
match was the first appearance of George
Hart, the winger, who was injured before
the side left M.L., but accompanied the
team as a visitor. His display fairly
took the crowd off; its feet and Australians
can congratulate themselves that he has been
unavailable for the earlier matches of the
four.

‘‘Sandy Gallop” : One of the Sydney war
correspondents who accompanied the All
Blacks on their_ Queensland tour had his leg-
pulled at Ipswich, where the tourists beat
a local side 25-6. This was the first big
Lnion game played at Ipswich since the
war, but the scribe was told that it was the
first appearance in the Holy City, as Ipswich
*s called, of a Union side, Ipswich having
been “an established Rugby League centre
lor 43 years.” As a matter of fact it is
just 43 years since a coterie in the North
of England formed the professional Rugby
body which they called the Northern Union,
and which is known in Australia as the
Rugby League. This game did not appear
m Australia until 1907, spreading to Queens-
land later. Ipswich teams played in the
Queensland Rugby Union from 1882 until
that body put up the shutters temporarily
in 1920.

“Hotham"; They take their football seri-
ously in A’ic, The supporters of St. Kilda
—which practically means the entire popu-
lation of the municipality—have been dis-
satisfied with the club’s play, so a public
meeting with the Mayor in the chair was con-
vened to remedy matters. Peeling ran high,
and after a person from another suburb who
had been interjecting was identified as an in-
terloper and thrown out, a motion that a citi-
zens’ committee be appointed to assist the
dub committee to straighten things out was
carried. There was a good deal of dissen-
sion, the opinion of one speaker that the
intrusion of a mob of aldermen and their
friends in the club’s affairs would do more
harm than good being evidently popular.
“1 itzeray”: The long-standing feud be-
tween the Y.F.A. and the League blazed up
again the other day at a meeting of the Asso-
ciation held to consider some means of re-
living the organisation, which, as one speaker
said, was fast going downhill. The general
opinion was that the unscrupulous League
was to blame. Its method is to lie in am-
bush until some Association club has per-
fected some choice lamb of a player and then
swoop down on him and sign him up. It was
urged that the Association refuse clearances
to players desiring to join League clubs, and
the matter is to be further considered. Even
that is hardly likely to stop the League’s
poaching. Now that a new rule has ham-
pered its activities in luring away players
from other States, there will only be the
Association to prey on.

“Rev. Knucklebone”: There was quite a

The Nineteenth Hole
■‘Divot Digger”: A friend lias forwarded
me an English golfing journal which re-
prints a Bulletin par. about ball-stealing
crows with some wounding reflections on
the writer’s veracity. AH the same the birds
® l ' e ** deadly nuisance on many courses.
A Ivillara member the other day discovered
a crow’s nest with 17 golf balls in it. There
were witnesses galore, and when the story
was published there came evidence of a
hoard of 40 being discovered at Condobolin
in out-back N.S.W. To make matters
worse, the crows invariably go for the glis-
tening new white balls. Anything second-
hand is ignored. If any of Australia’s bird
experts who write so convincingly in the
daily papers about our feathered fauna can
tell me what the crow's* idea is in pinching
(lungs for which he can have no manner of
use, on a pint of the best.
“Daffy”: There was a queer happening in
the opening rounds of the Australian club’s
championship in Sydney. Nigel Smith
was driving off from the tee when
his steel-shafted club broke in mid-swing
half-way down the shaft. The club-head
however, carried on and smote the balk
though the latter did not travel more than

out in a par 4, finishing the round with a

record was put up in Wales recently when

sion. At Portlicawl 30 players, including
many of the topnotehers, faced the blizzard
lor the 72-hole stroke competition. By the
time the fifth was reached the whole course,
including the greens, was under running
water. Ihe limit was reached when Roberts,
the Stoke I’ogis professional, had four shots
on the fifth green with a masliie niblick!

“Brassey”: Entries for the Australian
championships in Adelaide next month
are not so numerous as was expected,
but most of the stars among the profes-
sionals and amateurs will be there. One
who will be missed is young Jim Ferrier.
Among the Ma State professionals will
be Tom Howard, Frank Eyre and S. Rich-
ardson. the last-named a strong fancy for
the open championship. Ivo Whitton and
H. L. Williams will be two of the Victorian
representatives, while on their own ground
Rymill, Legli Winser and Rufus Stewart are
the nucleus of a strong South Australian
side.
“Hoylake”: Sarazen has an odd method
of teaching the correct swing of a
driver to his pupils. He has a special
club of ordinary size, but with the
head inordinately loaded with lead. His
theory is that with a light club it is
impossible for a beginner to describe a per-
fect arc travelling the same path each time
the learner swings the club. It is impossible
to swing this heavy club save in the perfect
arc, which it describes itself, in due course
educating its wielder to the point desired.
With this club the learner cannot keep the
weight on the right foot after the club has
passed the point of impact with the ball,
while he automatically achieves a long, low
follow through.

“Castle Adamant;': Yet another golf club
for women only has been opened in England,
at Forest Row in Sussex. All the caddies are
women, as are the club servants of all degrees.
Even the club cats must be of the feminine
gender, and it is alleged that one member has
already been expelled because she brought
her prize Pom.—-masculine—to the club-
house. It is painful to record, however, that
for green-keepers and supervising profes-
sionals the ladies have been compelled to
rely on males. In due course it is hoped to
dispense with these, the only flaws in this
feminine paradise, when women have been
trained to take their places.
Car and Cycle
“Differential": American motorists have
at last abandoned their “what’s the use”
attitude towards the world’s motor-speed
record, which has been in British hands for
some years. With 253.96 m.p.h. by Malcolm
Campbell to beat, Millers, the Los Angeles
makers of speed cars, are building a special
Machine for the job. The chassis will be
loift. long, and will carry a 24-cylinder 3000
h-P. engine built in three banks of S cylin-
ders, each operating on a single crankshaft
and driving through two transmissions to
front and rear wheels. Bore and stroke of
cylinders will be sin. and sJin. respectively.
Maximum power will be given off at 4000
revs, per minute, and gearing will be up to
360 m.p.h. Tliex-e is no stabilising tail as
in the Bluebird. The machine, which will
cost at least £lO,OOO, should be ready for
tuning up in November. Barney Oldfield,
winner of the title in 1910, when he drove
a Benz at 131.7 m.p.h., will di’ive.
"Kick Starter”: Australians, who intro-
duced the gentle art of dirt-track motor-cycle
racing to England and swept the board in
the big events there for several seasons, are
now finding the home-grown talent too much
for them. The game continues to be a big
draw, some 40,000 people watching the third
Test between England and Australia at Bel-
levue Gardens, Manchestei*. The English con-
tingent won by 53 points to 43. There are
two further Tests to be held, and the home
men are now one in the lead. Tom Farn-
don was the outstanding rider for England,
while Case was the best of the Australians.
“Whizz”: Queensland motor-cyclists are
again growling at the refusal of the local
authorities at some of the S.Q. seaside resorts
to permit beach l’acing. There are several
beaches ideal for the purpose. All have been
closed to the motor-cyclist, and for no good
reason, since none of them can be consid-
eied as thronged by bathers, as is the case
with some of the Sydney beaches. Selliok's
Beach in South Australia is ;1 notable course
for motor-cycle events, which draw biu
crowds there. Gerringong in N.S.W. is also
utilised for car and cycle i-acing, though if
is not easy to reach from Sydney, In Eng-
land many of the municipalities controlling
suitable beaches make a speciality of motor-
cycle meetings in the season, one notable
example being Southport in Lancashire.

and the amateur “Colac,” have been set
down this year for October S. The first.

Miscellaneous
• When everyone else is peaceably
inclined, the Victorian and N.S.W. athletic
authorities can always be depended upon to
start something. The latest row is over
the question of inviting a team from abroad.
Victoria wants a batch of Americans and

vited instead. Neither side will give way,
each refusing to find the money for bring-
ing over the other fellow’s fancy. Feuds of

the 1920 21°2| onie time after the war. For
seasons, he took over 100
wickets each year. His best trot was In
192.1, when he played against Australia in
one of the Tests at Nottingham. That year
his figures were 161 wickets for 17.09 each.
Australia saw him with the 1920-21 and
1924-25 English teams, but he was not a
conspicuous success. In all Tests he took
only 7 wickets for 490 runs.
"Aigburth”: The elevens chosen to repre-
sent England and the Rest in the trial match
for the Australian tour at Cardiff, begin-
ning to-day, make it evident that the next
series of Tests will be Australia versus the
Rest of the Empire. The England side in-
cludes two Indians in Duleepsinhji and
I'ataudi, with an ex-Australian in Allen.
Among the new bowlers is Fames, a fast
right-hander from Cambridge, who also plays
with Essex. W. Keeton, of Notts, is a pro-
fessional batsman of promise, while Brown
is another Cambridge amateur, a slow bowler
who lias been getting a lot of wickets.
Maurice Tate and Freeman, though still get-
ting plenty of wickets, have been passed over,
as has Percy Chapman, who has long been
in the black books of the Marylebone Club.

out the Empire, was won by England. Aus-
tralia, which did not compete on this occa-
sion, has had fair luck in this shoot, having
won in 1918-14-28. The British King's
Prize at the same meeting was taken by
A. Bailey, an ex-sergeant-major. As Bayley
was discharged from the army for defective
sight and still declines to wear glasses, the
joke is distinctly on someone.

a tour which will take in Queensland, Vic-

South Australia will also be tackled during
the inter-State carnival in Sydney, which
begins on August 6. They will also
visit Canberra, being the first international
team of any kind to figure in that historic
spot. The side, which is recruited from
Auckland, Waikato, Wellington and Canter-
bury, is the third to visit Australia from
the Shivery Isles, and is the holder of the
Manning memorial cup presented for con-
tests between M.L. and Australia.
“Hydro” : Kaye Don was not long in set-
ting up a new world’s record for speed-

new craft, England 111, he hit up a two-

m.p.li. one way and 119.12 the other. The
boat was engined with two of the famous
Rolls-Royce Schneider Cup aero engines,
which have now established world’s records
for Britain on air, land and water.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Lennon's Hotel
BRISBANE
The Centre Queenslands
Distinguished Social Life.
The foundation-stones of the Anzac Memo-
rial were laid on a still, warm day last week.
The historical occasion, the weather and the
.site in the midst of a romantic grove of
gnarled old Morton Bay figs called for some-
thing iu the nature of a pageant, but no
pageantry materialised. Dean Talbot, who
was the sole war padre in evidence, contri-
buted the only note of color, the scarlet of
his robes vieing with the black velvet of his
feminine-looking bonnet. The arrival of
Mr. Lang provided the first of the very mild
thrills of the afternoon. He got. a few cheers
from supporters on what might be called
“the outer”; Mr. Stevens collected some
genteel hand-clappings from those inside the
barrier. So did the Governor, who arrived to
the minute iu “civvies,” but with an impres-
sive row of decorations attached to his coat-
lapel. A chill silence, somewhat reminiscent
of a funeral, and Lud Mayor Walder
advanced to the microphone. The Governor
made some appropriate observations, so did
Mr. Stevens, and the stage was set for the
event of the day. Whistles shrilled lugu-
briously ; an immense crane functioned; the
Governor laid his stone like the adept he
is; Mr. Stevens laid Ms stone with a some-
what less finished virtuosity; Dean Talbot
intoned a prayer in the fruity voice in which
the Almighty is customarily addressed in
public, and with the singing of a hymn and
Kipling’s “Recessional” by the 20,000 or so
present the proceedings terminated.
It was a drab function, partly owing to
the absence of uniforms, partly because most
of those who might have given it life and
significance were in the background or
absent altogether. Mr. and Mrs. Lang sat in
the front row on the dais, near the Governor,
he frowning in democratic disapproval of
Mr. Stevens’s optimistic remarks about the
bright future of the State, she beaming
amiably. At the other end of the row were
Mr. and Mrs. Bavin, both very natty and
pleased with life, and near them the hirsute
Alderman Jackson, critically observing the
demeanor of his successor in the Lud Mayoral
robes. Behind sat a mass of politicians
and a few wives. Speaker Levy, for
some reason, was among those of presum-
ably lesser importance in the big crowd that
faced the dais. So were the Hugh Denisons,
Mark Sheldons and many more notabilities.
The only note of definite enthusiasm was
sounded as the gathering began to disperse
and Mr. Lang made for his car. A little
crowd cheered loudly and shouted words of
encouragement, to which his response was
a somewhat wry smile. “I want votes not
cheers,” he seemed to be saying dumbly as
he drove off, looking a very deflated leader
indeed.
Beatrice Kelly’s wedding was the cream on
a socially rather skim-milk week. Beatrice
and her ‘John MacPhillamy, looking, as the
bride’s mother Mrs. Bertie Kelly remarked,
like Mt. Yorke and Tasmania, he so over-
tops the tiny Beatrice, were made one in
St. Mark’s, at Darling Point, on a sunny
afternoon. Bertie Kelly gave his daughter
over to the young man from Bathurst, who
cheerfully took the vows to cling even as
closely as the burr. There were only 20 or
so invited guests in the church, as the big
wedding reception had been got over the day
before. The hoary old matrimonial exchange
was a snowdrift of flowers —camellias, jon-
quils and lilies; and the wedding frock was
white lame brocaded in gold. A white velvet
Russian blouse, edged with ermine, a Rus-
sian head-dress of pearls and a mist of
tulle veil were parts of the outfit. There
were no bridesmaids; bride’s brother Carlo-
ton was best man. Mrs. Kelly added a spot
of color with the blue-green satin frock this
Letter has complimented once before.
There were over 200 guests at the cock-
tail-shaking the day before the wedding;
half of Sydney had been sewing the trous-
seau (the two fairy-fingered Barlow sisters
were responsible for the very fine stitchery),
and there w 7 as a marvellous wedding cake,
made in' exact replica of ‘Mount Tamar,”
and new MacPhillamy home. Shutters, w7in-
dow-bars, trailing vines and flagged verandah
were constructed in colored icing.
It was perhaps a little bit unfortunate
that the Peace Ball demonstrated liow 7 very
dashing are the uniforms of Mars. Army
and Navy and Air Force, blue and gold and
red, stars and medals —bravely they flashed
under the lights of the Blaxland Gal-
leries, making one of the most spirited ball-
room scenes of the season. The attendance
w 7 as enormous, and parties ran into the
forties and fifties. Mrs. Norman Lowe hos-
tessed a crowd that rivalled the one brought
by the Bertie Kellys in honor of Beatrice
and John MacPhillamy. Lady Game, who
had been deeply interested in the charity,
had a cold and could not come to receive
the debs., but Sir Philip put a thrill into
the smile with which lie greeted nine snow 7 -
white maids brought forward to him by
Lady Chaytor. Under the sign of the A.1.F.,
a rising sun of immense proportions, this
Letter saw among a melee of brigadier-
generals, captains of the Navy, colonels
find other brass-hats, Premier and Mrs.
Stevens, and dancing beneath the be-
flagged balconies to the music from the Can-
berra band were groups from Sydney’s many
consulates. With France’s Consul-General
and his wife were Commander Constantin, of
the French sloop Bellatrix, and a group of
his officers.
Everything lias to have a beginning, and
on the sixth of October the grounds of Gov-
ernment House are to be the scene of a fair
for charity. Lady Game’s pet Bush Nursing
Association will benefit, and the fair will
rage throughout the day and evening. There
seems no end to the long list of workers. It
took the vice-reine’s drawing-room and ball-
room to hold the enthusiasts who rolled up
for the meeting last Wednesday. Knight
Henry Braddon had charge of the meeting,
Sir Philip spoke for Lady Game (who was
absent owing to a touch of ’flu) and Padre
John Flynn, of the Inland, and Mrs. J. A.
Lyons spoke feelingly of what medical and
nursing aid means to the out-back family.
The fete promises to be one of the most
dashing Sydney has known. It will be
introduced by a ball the evening before at
Government House. Clever Sadie Budge is
arranging all this. Another money-raiser
will be an exhibition on the draw r ing-room
walls of paintings contributed by Australian
artists. Alexander Gordon’s lady and Mrs.
Colin Stephen will be in charge of the circus
to be known as the Big Laugh. The.girls
from Doone will sell smokes, and Hangars,
Fairfaxes and McMasters occur almost with
monotony on the committee. The Mayoress,
Priminister Lyons’s wife, the wife of State
Premier Stevens, Mrs. M. F. Bruxner and
Miss Preston Stanley are on the list.
Passed out, four months after her husband,
the widow of that late remarkably young-
looking octogenarian Alfred Meeks, of Wol-
lerang, Darling Point. Devoted as a pair of
lovers to the end of their long life partner-
ship, both had the slender, active figures
and bright alert manners that we generally
label Youth. Every afternoon, unless some
temporary ailment prevented, the pretty old
lady drove into town to meet and “collect”
her old sweetheart, who forgot the Psalmist’s
limit and went to the city every morning
like other bright young men. As a frequent
hostess at the Royal Empire Society until
her husband’s death, the Meeks lady—whose
name was Alice and who bore a striking
resemblance to that other wonderful rid
lady Mrs. Hargreaves, original of Alice in
Wonderland —leaves a fragrant memory.
Dorothy do Sallis, a Sydney girl whose
poetry recitals are known to radio listeners,
is playing a
hazard with
fortune—off to
try her luck
on the stages
of America and
England. Since
her early
studies with
Lawrence
Campbell she
has appeared
in S li a k-
spearean parts
with the
Roland Mc-
Carty company
(Olivia in
“T w e 1 f t li
Night,” Portia
in “Jul i u s
Csesar” and
Helena in
“M i d summer
Night’s
Dream” were some of the heroines she per-
sonated). With Scott Alexander’s company
she played Camille and Tondeleyo, and two
more widely-apart heroines can scarcely be
imagined. Photo from Lupton.
Those who haven’t been up to visit the
orchids in the Botanic Gardens should rush
off to pay their respects without delay. You
will see them only through the clear glass of
the hothouses, but one expects that touch
of exclusiveness. Sometimes the petals
are spotted in varying colors, the spots so
bold they seem at a distance to be embossed.
The slipper orchids are fascinating; an
occasional slipper looks like a Cinderella
possession, but many of them are so roomy
that one suspects them of being the housing
place of some mother orchid who lived in
a shoe and had so many children she didn’t
know what to do. But that could only be at
bedtimes, for. of course, in the day she'd
simply turn them out to play in the gardens.
Even the wheels are agitated when the
too-briskly shut door of the motor-car
refuses to take its teeth out of the souffle
that is Claire’s (Thelma Todd’s) frock, and
it suddenly dissolves from Clair, leaving her
standing unconscious of her plight in sleek-
fitting undies and a sable-trimmed wrap.
The wheels arc so embarrassed that they
have to put their spoke in, and they go
round and round, beating out with the rest
of the amazed onlookers “Madam’s lost her
dress. Madam’s lost her dress !” This is
just one of the absurd scenes in “This Is
the Night,” which should keep that gay
story busy raising brisk laughs at the Prince
Edward till spring leaves come again. There
was a crowded house to see the first show-
ing of the picture, and to greet Gladys Mon-
crieff, who was singing glittering arias from
“Rio Rita.” Gladys was handsome in white
satin which changed under the lights to a
melting rose du barry; she sang like the
prima donna she is. and she was heaped
about with flowers. A flower banner flew the
name Gladys, and might have suitably borne
the word Excelsior if scaling heights has
anything to do with that word. The E. J.
Taits, the Fullers, the Hugh ,Wards and the
Dan Carrolls were in the house. Mrs. Dan
contrasted her blonde good looks with black
velvet. Mrs. Oliver Osborne, Adrienne Gros-
sardi and Mrs. Audette were three other
front-of-the-house attractions.
Geneva could scarcely summon more nations
to its conclaves than Mrs. Florent HoogstoeJ
will gather together in the Town Hall
to-night. Belgium, Italy, Russia, Yugo-Slovia,
China, Germany, Czecho-Slovakia, as well as
England, Ire-
land, Scotland.
Australia and
Maoriland, will
be represented
at the inter-
national con-
cert organised
by the ambi-
tions little
lady to assist
the Blind In-
stitution and
Braille library.

Mrs. R’oog-
st.o e 1, who
some years ago
joined the com-
pany of those
courage ous
“dark” men and women, as the Irish pity-
ingly call them. The programme is as spill-
ing over with stars as the Milky Way:
among them are the picturesque Don Cos-
sacks Choir, Belgian actor Carlo Liten,
Inga Stauge, a German dancer, our own
Frank Hutchens, Cyril Monk, Gordon
Lavers and Roland Foster’s Rainbow Choir.
King’s Old Boys celebrated the centenary
of Parramatta’s famous school at this year's
reunion dance. It filled the Blaxland Gal-
leries to overflowing, and was altogether a
great affair, for fathers and sons went foot-
loose together for a night in honor of the
classes they had absorbed or dodged in the
days whose hours were ticked off: by the
old school clock. This was reproduced in
flowers on treasurer Berry O’Connor’s table,
and a miniature of the school as it was in
1882 marked the stance of the official party.
The old low building in wallflowers and
stocks held quite a reception on its own
account. Sir Philip Game went along to
the party, taking with him official secretary
Harry Budge and Ins daughters Elise and
Sadie. They, together with the usual, batch
of representatives of the other public schools,
were entertained by G. W. Ash, acting-presi-
dent of the Old Boys’ Union, and Miss Ash.
W. Friend and G. B. Sutherland were .other
stalwarts of a committee on which wives of
members of the Old Boys’ Union and daugh-
ters of old boys played a strong hand.
The appointment 6f Miss Dulcie Graham
as private secretary - to the G.-G.’s lady has
left her sister, Mrs. Stephen (wife of Jus-
tice Milner Stephen),' feeling a little lonely.
However, even the cold ‘of Canberra has
failed to chill Miss Graham’s interest in
her new duties.
If the Young Idea grows up without a
sense of line and color you can’t blame
Howard Hinton, art-lover and -collector. He
believes in his gospel of beauty, to such .an
extent that he spreads it by perennial gifts
of paintings to the Art Gallery, and in the
last two years he has handed no' fewer than
20 oil paintings to the Teachers’ College at
Armidale (N.S.W.). These include works
by Heysen, James R. Jackson, A. H. F'ul-
wood and Arthur Streeton.
Belgium’s Consul-General, himself no
mean actor, was a front-seater with Mrs.
Segaert at the recital of Carlo Liten, the
celebrated dramatic actor and fellow-coun-
tryman. The actor, volatile, forceful, digni-
fied and mellow in turn (you knew that, even
if the spoken word came too swiftly for your
groping linguals), gave quite an air to the
stage of the Forum Club’s little theatre with
his leonine head and voluble hands. Dora
Moore was one of the few in the audience
who had seen the visitor in real drama.
This was in Brussels 20 years ago.
The Girl in the. Flat Opposite has just
returned from Grafton, where she was a
front-ranker in the “Bank to Grafton” Week
festivities; She is still raving about the
tree-shaded streets of that pretty town —the
jacarandasj the bunya palms and the plane-
trees, their leafiness shot through with
arrows of sunlight. For the Sunshine is
already ardent along the Rivers. Another
thing of which she talks with enthusiasm is
the cheap electricity, and she declares that
Dr. Page, who helped this scheme along, was
given more admiring glances from the ladies
of the district than any other man at the
ceremonials.
The festivities hovered' around two great
events: the opening of the Clarence River
bridge (which puts the journeys on the
sun-bathed punt across the broad silver high-
way of water into a thing of the past) and
the Grafton races. Both were favored by
peerless weather. Governor-General Isaacs
declared the bridge open in the presence of
every man, woman and child from both sides
of the river. There was an outsize reception
at the Town Hall, at which Mayor of Graf-
ton B. C. Eggins and Mayor of South Graf-
ton Schwinghammer were leading orators,
with the member for the district, Alt
Henry, close on their heels. The Country
Women’s Association had the inspiration to
stage a pioneers’ reception, and hither came
Mrs. Duckett White, whose father was with
the first settlers on the Clarence; Mrs. J. T.
McKittrick and W. J. Hawthorne. Nor
were the names of Maxwell. Bawden,
McLennan, Small, Ogilvie and Tindal for-
gotten. But the races were the frocky event
of the week. Summer clothes, fresh and
crisp, were worn by every woman.
Margaret Rawlings didn’t point out the
beauties of Heysen to callers at the Gros-
venor Galleries last Thursday. She had to
fly to Brisbane in the morning instead of
taking the evening train, so Syd Smith per-
formed the ceremony of introduction. Not
that most of the visitors needed it; they
sounded as though they had been keeping
a_ note of Hans’ doings in the paint line
since childhood. Mrs. M. Darling, from
Maequarie-street, was being slowly hypno-
tised by a beauteous still-life when this
Letter arrived, and Miss Rutledge procured
a ‘‘Frosty Morning” which congealed the
spring-like sunshine that sneaked into the
room, and made the log fire a necessity.
There’s a stark Mexican look in the artist’s
gorge and range landscapes, and an all Aus-
tralian one in the “Gums on River Flat.”

The death of Mrs. A. Douglas Graham left many
friends grieving. She was the daughter of the
late Police Magistrate G. P. M. Murray—one of
our own most beautiful girls in her youth, who
kept her looks and her sweet graciousness to the
last, and was always a quiet worker for charity.
She is survived by her husband, the well-known
barrister; a son, Murray, who is also in the law;
and Nell Douglas Graham, elocutionist and play-
wright, who has a large share of her mother’s
good looks.
The annual Catholic Ball was held in the City
Hall. Mrs. J. B. Harvey, in Lido-blue with an
apricot wrap, presented the 22 debs, to Archbishop
Duhig. Green and gold brooches were given to all
the girls. The proceeds of the ball go to Catholic
charities.
lan Gordon Salisbury, of Sandgate, and Elsie
Cochrane, of Killarney, w 7 ere made one in St.
Andrew’s Presbyterian Church. The bride, who was
given away by her father, was in ivory satin with
veil of ’broidered tulle. E. Cochrane ’maided in
rose pink, and Helen Cochrane was trainbearer in
lemon. The reception was at the Canberra and
the Northern Rivers (N.S.W.) sees the ’moon rise.
Mesdames Eric Hudson, j. G. Milne, Norman
,Heaslop and "Walter Douglas gave a party at Girra
Whem, Ascot, in honor of bride-elect Lorna Brooks,
of Dalveen, whose marriage to Donald Cameron will
take place in Warwick.
The Governor and Lady Wilson and their daughter
went to the Alliance Frangaise evening in Aitcherley
roof garden. E. Griffith Oxley and his wife received
the vice-regal party. Lady Wilson wore raisin velvet
and a perschanaki wrap ; her daughter was in snow-
drift lace and white fox coat. Sir Leslie Wilson
danced first with Elsie Woolfrey; his daughter
danced with Mr. F. Noyes and Griffith Oxley. Mrs.
Oxley wore black crepe- Black beaded georgette was
worn by Mrs. Carter; Clare Clarke chose leaf-green
lace.
St. Stephen’s, Torbanlea, saw the marriage of
Joseph Rehder and Emily Proctor. The bride was
given away by her father; she wore ivory bridal
satin with a Brussels net and lace veil. Mavis
Rowston, Olive Proctor and Doris Yappa ’maided in
lemon, pink and jade.
All Saints’ Hall saw the annual meeting of the
OrSche and Kindergarten. Mrs. A. E. Moore,
retiring president, greeted the Governor and his wife
and daughter. The Mayor and Mrs. Greene, Professor
Cumbrae Stewart, Dean Barrett, F. A. Cooper and
Mrs. Cumbrae Stewart were amongst the throng,
and Mesdames M. L. Reading, M. S. Herring, Hanni-
bal King and H. G. Peak served the tea. In the
evening the Victorian League had its party in
Rowe’s banqueting hall among crimson sweet-peas. ■
Lady Wilson, the new president, was in the chair,
his Ex. arriving later. Mrs. P. .1. Symes, Lena
Hammond, Gladys Frost and Archie Day were on
the musical programme.


Have You These
Symptoms of
Self - Poisoning?
I hrough faulty or incomplete evacua-
tion of the bowels, fragments of food
waste from digestion become encrusted
on the walls of the intestine. Germs
breed in this waste matter and enter
the blood stream, resulting in dreaded
self-poisoning ( autoxima ), caused
through hidden and unsuspected con-
stipation. These virulent poisons cir-
culating through the body undermine
the health, weaken the vitality and di-
rectly sap the strength. The life- giving
organs of Nature losepporerw r er to func-
tion properly. This leads to constipa-
tion, headaches, indigestion, gas in the
stomach and bowels, catarrh, backache,
rheumatism, neuritis, eczema, weakness
of certain organs, and hosts of other
ailments.
Before the health of youth can be
restored this poisonous matter must be
driven out of the system. And the safe,
sensible way to do this is to drink
COLOSEPTIC—the newer kind of in-
ternal cleanser. It first loosens and
dissolves, then smoothly washes out the
decaying waste. It rids the body of
all poisons and blood impurities
through Nature’s four outlets—the colon
or large intestine—the. kidneys—the
pores of the skin—and the respiratory
apparatus.
With the decaying crust removed, the
intestine scrupulously clean, and the
circulatory impurities driven from the
system, pure wholesome blood once
again flows through your veins. Help
yourself to health. Drink COLO-
SEPTIC in hot water every morning.

JHE words of the daily newspaper live only
for a. day. The wisdom in one issue is
too often cancelled by the folly in the next;
and, unhappily, folly is remembered far longer
than wisdom, —probably because mankind are
mostly fools. The reason that some newspapers
live when others die is that on the average
the survivors are less foolish than the defunct
were.
“THE BARRIER MINER” must be in the
Jess foolish class, seeing that it has been
published two or three times a day for the
past 44‘years at famous Broken Hill.

Ballarat lately farewelled W. D. Sweet-
apple, who had been manager of the Bank
of N. S. Wales there almost since grand-
father's day: he had been 47 years in the
bank, and spent some of the early ones in
Broken Hill when the branch was part of
a pub; most things were part of a pub
in Broken Hill in those days. Sweetapple’s
boss for some of the time there was Oscar
Lines, who later became general manager.
Mr. and Mrs. Sweetapple will be off to
Europe presently.
The Kilkare Revue Co., an amateur organi-
sation that made a successful debut some
time ago in “Incredible Happenings,” has
been performing “What Next?” at the Prin-
cess to aid various hospitals. Beryl and
Maisie Cowper were responsible for the
dressing and for many bright ideas. In
one scene the ladies of the chorus wore
white lace evening gowns, contrasted with
black gloves and satin shoes. White organdie
frocks with tiny frills shading to deep
yellow at the hem, topped by floppy crinoline
straw hats with long black velvet streamers,
made another pretty effect. Maisie Cowper,
in cream jersey and shorts, skipped her way
into favor in a dance popularised in Aus-
tralia years ago by Essie Perrin, now Mrs.
Fred Krcrouse, of Melbourne, who taught it
to Miss Cowper.
There was nothing elaborate about the
stage setting of "Macbeth” as done by the
Thorndike co. Scenery consisted mostly of
curtains of crimson, dull green or black;
props being limited to a tlirone-like chair or
two and a few other necessary items of furni-
ture. Dame Thorndike makes her first
entrance in a sort of scarlet toga, that almost
hides the purple gown beneath. As the
queen she wears a black gown lined about
the bodice part with gold, the long sleeves
ending in emerald-green cuffs. A cloak of
great width and length in gold lame, pat-
terned in grey and black, is added, and a
crown of gold with a border of pearls rests
upon a veil of rose-red chiffon. Lewis
Gasson, as Macbeth, here the King, offers a
contrast in his gold-embroidered bright blue
cloak and suit of mauve and gold. In the
first-night audience were knight Frank
Clarke and his lady, knight Robert Best and
his lady: the Howse lady. Dr. Nyulasy and
his sister Miss Nyulasy, Dr. and Mrs.
Murray Ruckle. Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Liston.

Amelita Galli-Curci sang lier farewells to
Melbourne at a not-very-well-attended mati-
nee at the Auditorium. The diva’s manner
was as radiant as ever. Her gown of deep
maize-colored taffeta was full-skirted, with a
quartet of small flat circular frills between
waist and knee. Lace and gold-and-silver
brocade formed the bodice, over which rippled
some strings of pearls. A quaint conceit
was presented in her armlets. One was a
band of artificial pastel-colored flowers,
while on the other arm was a frill of the
taffeta attached to a narrow band. Instead
of hanging down, the frill was turned up
around the arm like a bouquet-holder.
The Williamson opera eo. gave its per-
formance of “Un Ballo in Maschera” in
some pretty settings. The ballroom in the
Governor’s palace was a dream of pink and
mauve magnificence, and the dancers, whose
finery was mostly in pastel shades, blended
in admirably. The Junoesque Anna Surani
as the unhappy Amelia shed her black velvet
in this scene for a flowing robe of pink satin
and lace with a lime-green cloak. In a full
house were the Arthur Horderns. Mrs. Fred
Thiel and Marie de Bavay.
Raincoats are no longer the drab, dull
garments they used to be. Attractive-look-
ing silk- and velvet-finished fabrics take the
place of the hideous brown and grey gabar-
dines or mackintoshes, and even leather coats
are properly tailored and assume such be-
coming shades as bottle-green, nigger brown
wine red or goblin blue. The Chatterer fell’
in love with a raincoat, remarkably well cut.
fashioned in a velvet-finished stuff, white
black and ruby checked, with cuffs and col-
lar of maroon velvet. Topped by a match-
ing little velvet or felt hat, and equipped
with an umbrella, the wearer of such an
outfit need fear neither damp nor dowdiness
Some firms supply handbags of the same
materials as the coats.
Isabel Handley won both first aud second
prizes in the Lyceum Club’s competition,
open only to members, which was judged
by Gregan McMahon. The late Mrs. Albert
Miller donated the prizes. First place was
given to Miss Handley’s three-act play.
•'Pretty Sister,” not yet produced, and second
to the melodrama in verse, ‘‘The Mystery
of Manfred,” which was performed at the
Xavier memorial matinee lately.
Mary Patterson, who has been studying
chemistry abroad on a travelling scholar-
ship, came back the other day to rejoin her
mother and sister in Melbourne after about
three and a half years’ absence. In London
she did research work at the Lister Insti-
tute. On her way back to Melbourne she
halted for six months at Perth, where she
acted as locum in bio-chemistry at the Perth
Hospital.
Ella Shields spent a couple of days in
Melbourne fraternising with old friends on
her way to Adelaide.
The smile pictured here by Brootliorn be-
longs to Phyllis, a daughter of knight
Robert Best.
The young

Miss Best has
been on the
stage in Eng-
land for the
last four and

and got her
best chance
when she
stepped into
Margaret Ban-
nerman’s role
in “The Cal-

the present
Thorndike sea-
son she has
appeared as the page to Dunois in “Saint
Joan,” and as the Empress in “Madame
Plays Nap,” and -she also had a part in
“Macbeth.” She will be Helen of Troy in
the Sydney production of “The Trojan
Women.”
An anecdote told over the lunclieon-table
of a women’s club concerns the recent visit
to Australia of a representative of a London
publishing house. He had gathered his
agents together, and was suggesting to one
from a distant part of Bananaland that he
might be able to do something in his dis-
trict with an attractively bound cheap edi-
tion of Shakspeare’s works. The man from
Queensland shook his head doubtfully. “Ned
Kelly is more in their style,” he hazarded.
“Ah.” said the visitor, “an Australian pool.
1 suppose.”
Some years ago, when Madame Elmhurst
< Joode, who trained songbirds at the Con. in
Marshall Hall’s time, was forced to give up
her work, Iver friends established a fund to
keep her from monetary worry. Finances
are now getting low. so Elizabeth Pinchof
Finley gave a recital of lieder at the Lyceum
Club to replenish the coffer. Mrs. Ernest
Scott was the pianist.
Hobart happenings:—
There was a big- bridge tourney in aid of the
Alexandra Hospital funds. About 90 tables, were
reserved and there were raffles, etc., to catch the
nimble shilling. The tables were set out in the
Nurses’ Home, gav with pink and white heath in
masses.
Devonport has had a touch of the theatrical fever
which breaks out every winter in various parts of
the Speck. “The Players” gave an evening’s pro-
gramme of one-act plays, produced by ,T. McLaren
Morris, and scored a big success. The plays chosen
were Monkhouse’s “The Grand Cham’s Diamond,”
“Tlie Bishop’s Candlesticks” (Mr. Kinnel) and
“Followers,” by H. Brighouse.
Ihe Lieut.-Gov. and his better half smiled upon
the Hobart Philharmonics’ concert in the Town
Hall, when George A. Jackson conducted an excel-
lent programme. The society has improved out

cluded Margaret Burehem, L.A.8., Geo. Jackson,
Mollie Whitelaw, Claude Mitchell, Doreen Bidencope,
Chas. Clay, Lila, Harvey, Merci St. Leger and Reg.
Cooper. The orchestra’s best item was Mozart’s
Symphony in D major.
Mrs. Minett-Lueas lent her beautiful house, Wrest
Point, for the South Hobart A.W.N.L. bridge party.
The committee consisted of Mrs. Minett-Lucas her-
self, Mrs. W. Hodgman, Mrs. Raymond-Barker and
Miss Payne. Early violets, mignonette and narcissi
encouraged the idea that winter was passing.
The Charles Beckleys are the latest addition to
Hobart’s young matrimonial recruits. Mrs. Beckley
was Miss Audrey Maxwell Wright, of Calcutta and
London. Several welcome parties have been given,
by friends and relations to introduce the bride.
Violinist Szigeti drew enthusiastic audiences at
both ends of the Island. The pianist and accom-
panist with the romantic history ran him close in
popular favor.
Mr. and Mrs. Wilfrid Hudspeth, who were very
quietly married in June, have returned from Mel-
bourne and settled down at The Nook, Lower Sandy
Bay. Mrs. Hudspeth was Miss D. H. Gaggin.
formerly of Melbourne.
Col. McCpll, who has succeeded Col. Cox Taylor as
Military Commandant, and Mrs. McColl arc occupy-
ing the Commandant's quarters at Anglesey Barracks.
Adelaide doings :

an east wind that even got inside a fur coat. The
president (Mr. P. J. Flannagan) and his wife enter-
tained at afternoon tea, the bright spot of the day.
Mrs. Flannagan was in a black face cloth coat
with a collar of beige fur, and a black felt hat.
Friday next is to see the Palais Royal converted
into a London street, with real pie stalls and costers

C. G. CROSS IE
MAKES A REMARKABLE STUDY OF “LIFE” IK AK
ABANDONED GOLDFIELDS TOWNSHIP.
CAN A VAN would be glad to see me, the
publican had said, but he did not give
me that impression. His unresponsive,
preoccupied air might have been inadver-
tent. When there are years between even
casual callers, the machinery of one’s
manners is apt to become rusted up and move
stiffly.
He had. not many visitors. Wooreen had
been a busy j>lace once, but all human
activity had long ago passed from those hill-
sides, like the shadow of a cloud.
It was appallingly still.
The mountains, haunted by glooms and
splendors, varying in color and aspect,
almost it seemed in substance, as the day
waxed or waned —appearing with the fluctu-
ating atmospheric conditions to draw away
or loom nearer as in the movements of a
dance, and yet always remaining aloof, immo-
bile and immutable —exhaled an overwhelm-
ing calm. In the dusk a hush beyond the
power of the scant senses to perceive, but of
whose awful proximity the soul itself was
shrinkingly aware, seemed to rise with the
darkness out of their clefts and take pos-
session of the universe.
For the ear indeed there were dis-
tractions. Down the slope the creek
gabbled and chattered. The wind in the
endless meshes of the forest whispered and
sighed or wailed e and roared. But-'above,
below, around these drifting » interruptions
the all-embracing stillness" cdhld be felt.'
Even the publican,- hearty, healthy and
obtuse, was not immune.
He was a florid, capable man. Rough,
careless, commonsense exuded from him. He
had a rich’ vein of reminiscence, and found
inexhaustible entertainment in working it.
Besides, he had a pipe which when not in his
mouth was in his fingers. The ritual of pre-
paration for each smoke was most elaborate
and wove itself through all his stories.
Usually a fill and a yarn were contempo-
raneousthey ran, as it were, their race
together.
Digging out the bowl with the point of
his knife and tapping it, inverted, on the
verandah rail, he would recall an anecdote
and enlarge on it. steadily all through the
leisurely and deliberate business of lifting
tobacco from the tin, rubbing it between the
heels of his palms, crowding it, with one
crooked finger, into the bowl and tamping
it down. .
Lighting up necessarily interrupted his flow
of words, but could not altogether stop it; in
the midst of vigorous drawing and puffing lie
would contrive to shoot out a hasty sentence
or two from the corner of his mouth, so that
the narrative never quite lapsed.
It sometimes took a while to get his pipe
going, for if —as often happened—he chanced
just then to recollect some striking detail lie
would pause to dwell on it while the match
burned away in his fingers; the floor near
him was usually strewn with dead matches,
their number proportionate to the interest
of his story. '
But once it was going he would lean back,
cross his legs, and, getting fairly into his
discursive stride, would talk and puff and
puff and talk and enjoy himself hugely.
I doubt if without the pipe- he could have
gossiped half so freely. It made his wits
nimble, giving him the subtle support of in
established lmbit and a stock of gestures with
which to garnish his tales'. He was continu-
ally taking it out to emphasise, with levelled
stem, some important point, and replacing it
with an air of finality when some climax was
reached. He drew on it strongly as, with
absent eyes on the horizon, he dredged further
reminiscences from the deeps of memory, and
moved it in his mouth as he turned things
over in his mind.
Between stories he shifted his attention u>
the rouseabout—a shrunken little man whose
pale eyelashes dropped like a veil over his
furtive soul and who slipped warily about
the place as though burdened with secrets —
and bossed and harried him.
Between Wace (the rouseabout) and
myself, his stories and his pipe, the publican
had plenty of diversion, yet. there were times
when his loquacity took on a defensive
quality, and in its pauses—for even he could
not. run on eternally—tlie stillness flowed in
on us again. , . ,
And I think he was sensible ot it; .tor one
afternoon, leaning on the verandah rail above
the wire-netting on which hung, like the
remains of a vegetable malefactor, the sere
stems of a withered creeper, he said pro-
foundly, after , a pause, “There’s not enough
people round here.”
It was then he suggested I go down to see
Canavan, giving me to understand it would
be something of a charitable action.
. “He’s all alone there, year in year out. A
nice fellow,.too; just a bit”
And he tapped liis forehead.
■-•As I went down the hill he shouted some-
thing after hie.
I made out the word “ducks.'
“Keep off ducks!” he shouted again and 1
nodded.
But Canavan, as I said, did not seem very
pleased to sec me. H'e gave me the impres-
sion of being one to whom communication
with his fellows was an art not so muen
lost as laid aside; as though friends and
acquaintances were things he had outgrown.
He was courteous, but with an obvious
effort; talked vaguely and listened absent-
mindedly, as though he had some secret pre-
occupation which rendered all else irrelevant.
I was soon reduced from the feeling of
affable • benevolence with which I had greeted
him to a sense of being an intruder.
Presently, however, he roused himself,
became more friendly and communicative, and
took some trouble to point out to me the
site of the settlement before the mines petered
out and when it was confidently assumed that
Wooreen would become a town.
It was difficult to discern traces of that
time. Long ago the bush had flowed back
again over the temporarily cleared patches.
Season after season had added its quota of
growth, fledging the raw earth anew, smooth-
ing out scars, reclotliing denuded areas, till
now, save for the comparative youth of cer-
tain groups of trees, all might still have been
the untouched, primal - forest. The shaft
of wdiat had been the Golconda .No.- 2 cer-
tainly remained, its black mouth gaping at
the sky ; but all so draped and softened with
grasses and’plants and so embowered in. foli-
age as to seem to be lyiqg perdu. I dropped
a stone into it and heard, after a pause, a
faint, ambiguous sound, impossible to say
whether splash or thud, stir hollowly in the
darkness below. Beyond this only the ruins
of a few huts, a tangle of abandoned
machinery rusting away embedded amongst
the fern, and some timbers, grey, rotten, in
parts scarce distinguishable from the damp
earth into which they were mouldering,
remained to mark the place.
The sun set as we walked back towards
his hut, expiring amongst the hills in a
gush of heart-breaking beauty, and the day
went out .with long-drawn pomp of melan-
choly glory as solemnly as though there
would never be, another.
We stayed talking’ near his hut. Beyond
his back I could see the softer contours and
more decided green of the trees along the
creek and a line of pale ducks waddling up
the slope.
Canavan’s tongue had warmed to its work
somewhat by now, and he was in the middle
of a long story concerning the striking' of a
“mullock horse” in the early days of the
Golconda No. 2, when the ducks, which had
gathered into, a bunch behind him and were
stretching their necks at us, suddenly all
quacked together.
At the sound the ordinary ease of manner,
the slightly casual attitude natural to the
average human being, fell from him. His
gaze leapt to my face and his eyes fastened
themselves on mine with such a fixed inten-
sity, such dumb vehemence, that I was
startled.
“Did you hear that? What do you make'
of it?” he asked quickly and earnestly.
I had only been ten days in Wooreen: it
sounded like no more than quacking to me,
and, rather at a loss. I said so.
Canavan made a brusque gesture of im-
patient contempt as at an evasion too' pal-
pable, a falsehood too gross, and answered,
“Oh no! No! That’s deliberate.”
As if conscious of being discussed the drake
gave his guttural drawl and the ducks all
quacked again loudly and foolishly.
“There! What did I tell you?” said Cana-
van, with a look so inhumanly wild and yet
so positive that it staggered me. "He says,
‘All together!’ and they all quack at me.”
Ineptitude seemed to possess me. I was
never so conscious of my limitations. For-
tunately the ducks moved off without further
demonstration, for all I could think to do was
to revert to the story of the “mullock horse.”
At first my questions seemed to irritate him,
but gradually some inward tension relaxed,
the stress went from his manner and he
finished the story very lucidly and concisely.
The dusk was thickening; I moved to go,
and then, in the middle of a comment on the
mildness of the weather, he hesitated, lost
the thread of that idea, and, looking at me
with a return of that anguished earnestness,
said, “You know, a man can’t stand too
much of that sort of thing.”
I came on the ducks on my way up -the
hill in the fading light. They milled into a
more compact body as I approached, and
stood, with bobbing movements of their
heads, looking at me first with one eye then
with the other.
Then the drake gave a lazy, rolling call
and the ducks all quacked.
As I went by the performance was
repeated, and was again thrown after me as
I went on.
Against the background of the soundless,
stirless, illimitable forest, now, when to the
solitude of the place was added the eerie
loneliness of that dim and dying hour, the
sound .took on significance. It was impossible
not to receive an impression of premeditation
from that concerted action.
I began to consider whether there had or
had not been a flavor of insolence, a hint of
aggressive derision, about it.
. To come to and.find myself seriously debat-
ing this gave me a shock. It was like the
light touch of a small cold hand.
• I was. glad to get back to the publican and
have him to talk to about Canavan.
He said, “I had no idea it was as bad as
that,” and being a man of energy and deci-
sion he walked down with me the next day.
Taking the pipe from his mouth and look-
ing directly at Canavan, he commenced, “I
believe them ducks, have been at you again.”
Canavan gave him a dreadful look.
The publican drew nearer. Tapping Cana-
van with the stem of his pipe he said, sym-
pathetically and impressively, “Listen, man,
you don’t want to let a mob of ducks get you
down. They want putting in their place.
D’y’ think I’d put up with that sort of thing;
Not on your life! And don’t you. If
they give you any more cheek, take an axe
and chop their heads off.”
But-Canavan, though he could make no
stand against the publican’s burly sanity, was
not converted.
He • became uneasy and moody, muttered
something about .having .them.-over since they
w r ere little, and escaped as soon as he could.
And when the following day he caught
sight of'us near his hut he popped inside
and shut the door.
“D’y’ see that?” cried the publican. “He’s
dodging us.”
It annoyed him. “This has got to come
to an end,” he said firmly, after chewing on
his pipe for a spell; and after tea he went
off again towards Canavan’s with a sack
under his arm. . t ' ?;
He was soon back again, stooped over
under the weight of the sack, in which a
bulging, disturbed mass was visible.
“I’ve got ’em,” he said with a triumphant
grin, lowering the pack carefully to the,
ground. “The whole bang lot.”
Holding the mouth of it gathered in his
hand he went on: “I offered him his own
price for them. God, you’d ’a’ thought I
was .Tudas! He didn’t know what to do.
Couldn’t get yes or no out of him. At last
he waved his arms and cleared off down the
creek, and I gathered them all in.”
Lifting the sack again he said, “They’re
as fat as butter. The tourists are due'to-
morrow. It’s part of my contract to give
them a poultry dinner. This time it’ll be
duck; duck —and lots of.it. I’ll give them
the feed of their lives.”
He went round the back calling Wace to
fetch.him the axe, and in a few minutes yet
another despotism went out in blood and
confusion.
The tourists sent their influence before
them. The bustle of preparations for their
entertainment alone did much to reduce
nature to her proper proportions; and when
they came and filled the place with stir and
talk the hills became no more than heaps
of earth stuck with trees.
To them after their long drive through
the hills from Merrywell, the big table in
the dining-room must have been a pleasant
sight; and under the spell of roast duck in
such generous quantities male and female
appeared at their best.
After dinner one of the party, leaning
against the verandah railing and looking idly
abroad, said, “Pretty little place, but
dull.”
That remark, though apparently forgotten
as soon as heard, must have lodged in some
corner of my brain, for coming back to
Wooreen across the hills a week later, and
catching sight of the little hotel, like a soli-
tary, pale bead lost far down the valley,
it recurred to me.
I had been. over, in Thorleigli, where one
saw as many as a dozen people in the day.
and in the wholesome activity of that com-
paratively bustling and: trivial place I had
forgotten the deep solemnity of Wooreen.
But now as I saw again that one white
speck amidst the billowing hills, and felt
once more the influence of those still and
empty distances, that vast, listless, timeless
solitude began again its work upon m,v
spirit, and I knew* that the hours were its
allies. I thought no, it was not dull, but
too exciting; there all those merciful, small
distractions with which we shield ourselves
were stripped away and the frail human
soul left stark before insoluble enigmas.
The little hotel itself with, as usual, no
one visible and no sign of movement about
it, seemed to doze upon the hillside, torpid
and entranced. Some of the white down
scattered to the wind in the slaughter of
the ducks had caught amongst the dry stems
along the wire-netting. It looked as though
the dead creeper had put forth ghostly
blooms. _
Wace looked out as I came up and van-
ished again at once. His furtive manner
seemed to have taken on a deeper tinge or
uneasiness, as though the secrets were now
guilty ones.
The front door stood open to the sun-
shine and light wind, but the door of the
dining-room was closed. Against its panels
a persistent fly bumped and buzzed.
That was the only sound until, at my
step, the publican appeared.
His hands were in his pockets, his pipe
in his mouth, but his hearty floridity seemed
to have gone slightly hollow.
He withdrew one hand, took out his pipe
and, looking at me, said, “Well, he’s done it
fit lust
“Didn’t Wace tell you?” he went on.
“Yes ; jumped down the old- Golconda. We
had the devil of a job getting him up. 1
wish I’d never seen the blasted ducks, he
added sullenly. ' ' .
The dining-room door opened and llesch,
the, constable from Merrywell, came out.
The fly rushed in above his head, and
across liis shoulder I had a fleeting
glimpse of the long table, the table that
had ’ held the ducks, and saw 7 on it. in the
semi-gloom of the darkened room, an inert
shape, rigid and veiled in white.

TO SUCCES
iELMANISM is concerned with personal attributes and
A qualities which are fundamental. They may be
sleeping or only partly developed, but they are in every
normal individual. Pelmanism develops them, separately
and together, so that amongst other things concentration is
made easier by quickened perceptions; natural energy enor-
mously increased by interest, and prompt decision justified
by soundness of judgment.
Amongst these attributes and qualities are:—
Concentration
Judgment
Decision
Will-power
Initiative
Self-confide
Presence of Mind
Organising Power
Cheerfulness
And a Reliable Memory.
The development of these strong, positive, vital quali-
ties contributes to one s earning capacity, makes for security
and so makes it possible to live “intelligently and strongly.”
The People Who Take the
Pelman Course.
There is only one kind of man who takes the Pelman
Course, but he is found in every calling and in every walk
of life. He is the man who wants to excel, who will not
be deterred by circumstances, who will live intelligently
and strongly, the man who will reach out and take the good
things that every age and every occupation offer to him
who has the wit and courage to take them.
AN ACCOUNTANT states that Pelmanism
has shown him “how to overcome that
paralysing feeling of inferiority.”
A SHOP ASSISTANT reports that he has
secured a better position, and attributes
this to Pelmanism.
A FARM-WORKER writes: “Thanks to
Pelmanism, I am feeling more confi-
dent and more alive.”
A MANAGER reports an increase in
Self-confidence, “which has brought
me the respect of my colleagues.”
AN ENGINEER writes: “I feel especially
an increase in Self-confidence, which
gives professional status.”
A CLERK writes that he has improved
in memory, concentration and will-
-power, and that his mind is quicker
and more alert.
A DOCTOR writes that he has improved
his powers of Observation, Concentra-
tion and Memory, and has increased
liis Self-confidence.
AN INSURANCE CLERK' writes: “Finan-
cially 1 am over 30 per cent, better
off than before; mentally and physically
I am hundreds per cent, better off.”
A WOMAN CLERK writes: “I can con-
centrate for quite a long period with-
out my mind wandering. I observe
things far more quickly, and have ever
so much more confidence in myself
and my abilities. My thoughts are far
more orderly.’’
writes: “This Course has
had a remarkable effect on my physical
and mental health. .What pleases me
most is the certainty that. I have lost
my fear. My Self-confidence has
returned, and my whole outlook on
life seems to be reconstructed.”
A CLERGYMAN writes: “Had I known
at the age of 30 certain things which
I know now—largely through the Pel-
man lessons—l think I could have
avoided one or two painful nervous
breakdowns” ~..
A BANK CLERK writes: “This Course
has enabled me to see clearly what I
want in life and how to get it. It
has taken me out of the rut.”
Thousands of similar letters from
all over Australia and New Zealand
could he printed did space permit.
DAME SYBIL
THORNDIKE
as “Saint Joan.”
“Pelmanism,” Dame
Sybil Thorndike says,
“gives mill'd exercise scien-
tifically, and because the
principles are scientifically
based, it not only im-
m
——
proves, but actually discovers qualities that
would otherwise have remained dormant.
“Pelmanism, I am convinced, is the ‘Open
Sesame’ that smooths away all difficulties in the
way of success, giving: a mental clarity and
quality of alertness that sees opportunities and
uses them rightly.
“One of its chief charms is its simplicity, and
with minds rich in perception life becomes
altogether more satisfying.”
SIR HERBERT AUSTIN.
Sir Herbert' Austin, Chairman of the world
famous Austin Motor Co., Ltd., writes: “The job
for every one of us is first to fit ourselves for
better things and then to go out after them
Here it is that Pelmanism is proving of immense
help to-day... Too many people are just drifting
Pelmanism can stop that drifting and start the
drifter on a useful journey.”
DR. F. W. NORWOOD, D.D.
“Pelmanism,” Dr. Norwood, of the City Temple,
London, says, “is sound Psychology and an
admirable system of MimUtraining. It reduces
to a coherent system what
every person who lives
intelligently and strongly
must at least partly carve
out for himself A
proper gyasp of Pelmanism
would save any life from
futility and would cause
many to discover powers
latent within themselves
of the existence of which
t'hey had not dreamed.
Pelmanism teaches that
man has the key to his
own career and enables
many to find the key itself
which, for want of self-
knowledge, had lain un
discovered.”

STORY WRITING
THE PUPILS OF
MR. BERNARD CRONIN.
The consistent progress made by the
band of new writers who are Mr. Cronin’s
pupils, and the frequent editorial appreci-
ation of their work, justify an analytical
note on the sympathetic criticism and
practical advice which are the foundation
of the Bernard Cronin Story-writing Course.
CRITICISM AND ADVICE.
Frankness and honesty of purpose ar
the very substance of all helpful criticism
An inexperienced writer can be helped only
if* his faults are exposed to him, stated
explicitly and impersonally in such a way
that he is made very much aware of them
In giving the advice and instruction tha
should follow criticism the helpful critic
is no longer impersonal. He ceases to look
at the manuscript as an editor. He identi
fies himself with the writer, and exerts
himself to point out how by inclusion oi
omission, by condensing here and amplify-
ing there, by reconstructing, by pruning and
polishing, a story may be made acceptable
and so justify the effort of creation and
add to the pride of accomplishment the
distinction of publication.
It is with a full sense of his obligations
that Mr. Bernard Cronin approaches the
criticism of any work submitted to him by
his pupils. He recognises that in even the
crudest piece of writing there is a definite
intention, and his criticism and advice have
one object to show the writer how that
intention, if possible, may be fulfilled.
Mr, Cronin’s methods are orderly, his
manner direct, and his matter clear and
exact. He takes first things first, dealing
with the real essence of the story, showing
its inherent worth as an idea to be de-
veloped, This, in itself, is a valuable lesson.
The attractiveness and suitability of the
title are then considered, and this
is followed by itemised criticisms of
plot, dialogue, characterisation, style, con-
struction and presentation. Practical
matters such as the number of words, size
of paper, margins, spacing, paging, etc.,
are not overlooked, and when the MS. is
up to publication standard, the publications
for which it is suitable are named.
In addition to teaching stofy-writing,
Mi. Cronin criticises the MSS. of writers
who have had only a limited success. This
critical service has proved of great value
to many whose work, through minor faults
of construction or presentation, has just
failed to get publication.
Mr. Cronin has been writing for 20 years,
and he has published, in Australia, in Eng-
land and in America, numerous successful
novels and hundreds of short stories. His
Story-writing Course is fully described in
an illustrated pamphlet, “Writing to Win.”
Copies will be sent post free to any reader
of The Bulletin who would like one.
Those specially interested in the criticism
of MSS. are requested to mention the fact.
Letters can be addressed to Mr. Bernard
Cronin, 398 Flinders Lane, Melbourne.
The late Sir Ernest Hodder-Williams,
founder of the publishing-house of Hodder
and Stoughton, wrote that it was “a. pleasure
and an honor to be associated with Mr.
Cronin in publishing.” This is not an
isolated opinion. Mr. Cronin has the respect
of every working editor and publisher in
Australia. Those who seek his services are
in good company.
