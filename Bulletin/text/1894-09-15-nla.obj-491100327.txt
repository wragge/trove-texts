The Wickedness of Woman.
Mr. Richard Le Gallienne, one of the pretty throng of minor poets who play
about the lower slopes of Parnassus, has written dexterously on the Blessedness of
Woman. That is the swifter phase of her, and perhaps it is rather attributive than
essential. But no mere male can grapple with the Wickedness of Woman, since the
M ickedness is really the W oman, and Woman is by the law of her existence an in-
soluble problem. Never will we give her up! If “ by her pluck she brought our
race to grief,” as “ Dagonet ” wittily says of Eve, it is surely proper to meet pluck
with pluck, and to vanquish the fair foe by force of arms which embrace her. Were
sex-mathematics pure, instead of mixed, it might be thought that Man is the asymp-
tote to Woman’s voluptuous curve, pursuing the impossible tangent through infinite
ceons of approximation. That is the poetic theory, and Ellisian science now defends
Goethe’s Elysian verse, so that by-and-by we may really get close enough to know
our Sphinx, if not to know her. And then—we shall find that her Wickedness is
but a form of her Blessedness, as to Whitman Evil seems only a kind of Good 1 It
may bo.
Of course the difficulty is only with Woman : a woman is easily unravelled.
Even her whims are regulated by ascertained law. Like a charming doll she says
Mamma ! and “ Papa ! (as appendages to an appropriate “ Ask whenever one
touches the spring; and so far as she understands herself we can understand her.
But to this husk there is a kernel which defies our search and tricks our wisdom.
Nothing so mutable, vagrant, elusive ! Mr. Rochester, who could crush Jane Eyre
with a finger, despaired so of possessing the intangible soul of his morsel sprite.
The same despair moved Svidrigailoff, in Dostoieffsky’s “ Crime and Punishment,”
to unclasp his arm from Dounia’s waist when she lay fluttering at his mercy. The
brute in man is powerless before the mystery of womanhood. And the god in man
knows it.
Now, to the laudable effort which men. are continually making to discover
wherein lies the \\ ickedness of \\ oman, it is plain that women may render much
valuable assistance. For, if they do but scan themselves with introspective eye,
and faithfully chronicle their aches and pains, their attractions and repulsions, their
driftings and tendencies, they will widen and strengthen the basis of a diagnosis
which can otherwise be founded only on the observation of complicated and contra-
dictory symptoms. Thus the current English eruption of erotic literature has high
sociological interest. From the mud thrown up by volcanic women one may
judge of thought-stuff simmering far down in the placid bosoms which we pass every
day without dreaming of the fires that glow beneath.
It is frequently said that a woman cannot keep a secret. There never was a
greater error. Only trifles she blurts out : the tremendous secret of Herself she
hoards while sense and breath remain to her. Pressure is less under barbarism;
but the life of a civilised woman is one long hypocrisy. She shows herself, not as
she is, but as she wishes or is wished to be. Concealment is her essence. Plastic in
the mould of conventionality, she suits her actions easily to her environment, and
contentedly sacrifices liberty for safety. A marriageable girl, she hides from her
lover everything which she judges may be disagreeable to him ; a wife, her husband
rarely dreams of the buried life that flows along silently by his side.
Sometimes, under anaesthetics, we get a glimpse of the real woman. Doctors
can tell strange tales of the language that pours from virginal lips in the brief
interval which precedes complete unconsciousness or complete awakening. Some-
times, in insanity, we see more. There are few horrors like the horrors of
nymphomania. And, occasionally, as at the present time, the veil is raised in
literature, and we begin to understand why the pious fathers of the Christian Church
cursed woman as an impure obstacle placed by the Devil in the way of spiritual
salvation.
Woman is now moved by the Zeitgeist to explain herself ; and it behoves Man
to listen attentively, for such an opportunity may not occur again. She declares
that her Wickedness coils round the root of sex, as might have been presaged
physiologically, historically, and philosophically. Physiologically, since sex is to
woman what the tides are to the ocean, ebbing and flowing in eternal rhythm, and
perhaps owning the same original cause. Historically, since throughout the ages
the weaker vessel has been primarily a vessel of passion, a love-lute with the loosened
girdle of Venus for her single string. Philosophically, since the discussion of sex-
questions has hitherto been tabooed to women, and women yearn for the tabooed.
Now they haye broken the taboo, and proceed to defile the temples of conven-
tionality while “Ouida” and Mrs. Lynn Linton shriek vainly in agonised protest. The
New Woman does not care for “Ouida” and Mrs. Lynn Linton. Her mission is to set
Man to rights in fifteen editions; and she is fulfilling it successfully if not artistically.
From a classical standpoint, the books mentioned below are mere ephemerae, which
to-day are all the rage and to-morrow are cast into the dust-bin. From a sociological
standpoint, as already affirmed, they have considerable importance. From the
standpoint of the world which amuses itself they have novelty, interest, and some
share of prurient piquancy.
“ A SUPERFLUOUS WOMAN.” Cloth, 316pp.; 3s. 9d.
This book is in many points the best of the batch, and the story has charm
and power, though too obvious a purpose. The theme is the struggle between the
primal, physical, feminine side and the secondary, ladylike, conventional side of a
London society belle. Conventions hold her till she is 20 or so, when she revolts,
buries herself with Nature among Scotch peasants, and falls in love with a simple,
grand, serious boor. Sexual attraction impels her to offer herself to him, but his
Covenanting principles are so many wet blankets on the flame of passion, and he
makes the grand refusal. Disgusted with herself, the lady returns to London con-
ventional side a-top; marries a lordly roue : bears two epileptic infants, who slaughter
one another when old enough ; tries vainly to reform her roud; and dies miserably.
The peasant, meanwhile, has kept single and simple, and grows grey in getting up
early in the morning to gaze across the misty heather and ponder what a
Covenanting ass he was.
Reads strong, doesn’t it ? It is strong. Here you have a statement of the
motives which impel the naughty heroine to tempt the Puritan hero by night in
lis barn.
“ Oh, good God, forgive my thoughts and fulfil them ! . . .
“But afterwards the return ! London and the old circle of flattering friends, with
ominously silent faces and a pin-like curiosity in their eyes.
“ To these,” said Jessamine, “ I speak frankly. I force myself to do it. I carry in
my arms my little baby, and I say ‘ This is the child of the man I love, and for whom for
ever, though 1 see him no more, I shall live as a true wife. He was the best and truest man
I ever met, ami the finest to look upon; and he took my heart by storm. He was a
peasant, and lived in a sort of hovel, and. worked in the fields with his own hands; he looked
splendid when he was reaping the corn, He had been educated ; but it was a small matter:
he did not read much ; he said quiet, wise things instead. I’m afraid he knew no poetry,
but his eyes were poems in themselves. He had no adventures, neither had he any vices.
He was wholesome, from his sunburnt skin to the inmost core of his heart. There was not
a spot in his while nature from which you had to turn away your eyes. Such a power of
goodness went from him that he had but to look at me and I grew better. I could not
marry him, because I was not fit for the duties of his wife : but, yes, I loved him an fi
united myself to him with trembling joy. y 80 thafc I
“And this is my baby.”
!!!!!!!!!!! j I
There can be no doubt of the moral teaching of a book which talks like tIV
and then goes and shows the ruin that follows an opposite course. It is a dir
appeal to the barbaric passion of Woman. ec
“OUR MANIFOLD NATURE,” by Sarah Grand. Cloth, 271 pp. • 3 S a,
“THE HEAVENLY TWINS,” by Sarah Grand. Cloth, 679 pp. • 7 S U'
“ IDEALA,” by Sarah Grand. Cloth, 269 pp.; 3s. 9d.
Sarah Grand is the accepted leader of the Revolting Woman in h
crusade to win a New Jerusalem of Clean Men. “We have lost faith
men, she says in “ Ideala.” “ Why should we keep ourselves niif l
if impurity is to be our bedfellow?” And every one of her books has
horrid example in the shape of a decayed rake who mates with a virt UOu !
maiden (with episcopal sanction and approval in “The Heavenly Twins
and fathers a precocious baby like the ope in the Bab, Ballads, who “died J
enfeebled old dotard at five.” Now, against this crusade it is impossible for
unprejudiced persons to cast any stone of censure. Men like Clean Women •wh ■
shouldn’t women like Clean Men ? It is of no use for Angel Clare, after encoun
termg a strange woman in London, to come back and tell Tess Durbeyfield i 0 vf„l
in her confidence that “ ’tis just the same,” that sexes alter cases. For they don’t
at any rate from the standpoint of morality and justice. Let us, therefore bp
magnanimous, wish the crusade luck, and concede that Sarah Grand has a right to
her Clean Man whenever she can catch him. 8 y
“ THE HEAVENLY TWINS ” is material for two novels awkwardly thrown
into one. It is clever and attractive, but Evadne is tiresome and should have been
omitted altogether. The “ Twins ” themselves are a really sparkling pair, and would
almost justify superlatives if they were not weighted down by the necessity 0 f
providing suitable morals for Unclean Men. It is true that, for a Clean Woman
the author writes her copy-book headings with a queer fist. But probably nine -ids
out of ten would jump at the chance of repeating Angelica's adventures'
Tenor.
IDEALA moralises rather monotonously on the wrongs of woman, and on
the whole, the shock to Mrs. Grundy is not sufficient to counterbalance the' duiness
from the average reader s point of view ; though social critics may find plenty material
for comment.
MANIFOLD NATURE” is a collection of short, readable stories of no
particular value, with the Clean Man again advertised for. The preface is the most
striking thing in the book.
• .l It Suc< ? essful magazines dig deep grooves for themselves, and anything that does not fir
into these is shunned as dangerous. Once established they become, for the m 1 part ua
progressive, neither leading nor following, but continuing to offer us the kind of tlnug’ that
pleased our parents. Consequently, they cease to appeal to us. and finally expire in a
resolute efiort to resist any attempt to induce them to air the grievances, touch upon the
interest, or meet the special demands generally of the present generation. Diffident young
writers, full of the force which is carrying us onward and upward, and cruelly perplexed
between what they perceive and what those in authority insist that they ought to be per-
ceiving, crawl along in them on feet of lead until the "restraint becomes unbearable, and
then they break out on their own account in new directions, and their success proves to be
the death-blow of their oppressors.”
“THE YELLOW ASTER,” by lota. Cloth, 317 pp.; 6s. 6d.
This is a smart and amusing book, which sets and solves a special sex-problem
on its own account, as already explained in The Bulletin columns. Its plot is too
fanciful to aid us much in analysing the Wickedness of lYoman.
“DODO,” by E. F. Benson. Cloth, 441 pp.; 6s. 6d.
“THE RUBICON,” by E. E. Benson. Paper, 394 pp.; 2s. 9d. ;/• I
Mi • Benson is said to be nephew to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and pre-
sumably he represents the power of the Church as called to the help of the crusaders.
e cannot, however, help being biassed by his manhood, and has devoted the greater
part of his space to limning the Unclean Woman, which is not fair. On the
whole, “Dodo” is about twice as good as “ The Rubicon,” and “ The Rubicon”
is good for very little. “ Dodo,’ whether she be Mrs. Asquith or not, is an excellent
lady not to meddle with. She talks smartly until she marries a lord whom she does
not care foi, and when he dies in disgust and she has a chance to marry the man
she likes she takes a Russian prince instead. The lady of “ The Rubicon ”is merely
a Dodo who talks less smartly. All the same, “ Dodo ”is in her thirteenth
edition, and her sentimental flippancy throws considerable psychological light upon
the dark places of her devious sex.
When all reservations have been made it is plain that the vogue and celebrity
which these writers have so speedily attained imply that, to some extent, they
interpret existing social tendencies. Is the “ revolt ” a revolt in the direction of
healthy blood and a healthy race ? an instinctive revulsion from modern cant and
disease to primeval purity and natural passion ? If so, we can easily pardon its
errors and exaggerations.

Writes :
It is a liirliter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy
nauseous odour characteristic of others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally, which places
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its
value.

“ People won’t go to church, because they
don't want to hear who Melchisedec wasn’t.”—
TalmAgk.
The Victorian Court at the Imperial Insti-
tute, London, has gone to wreck and ruin. The
moths have eaten the furs in the show-cases, the
authorities have removed the agricultural exhibits
as useless lumber, and the Court is described by
those who have seen it lately as a desolate, dirty
hole. Yet .£5OO a year is paid towards maintain-
ing it.
The dinner and reception given at the
Imperial Institute to celebrate the 25th anniver-
sary of the extension of the electric-cable to India
and the East, cost, it is said, <£7ooo. It was very
well done, indeed, and no expense was spared to
make it a success. Pender is a wily personage,
and is preparing for the inevitable Pacific cable,
in the laying of which he is determined to take a
hand.
Dear Bulletin, —A story of revenge.
Swayne, a friend of mine, is manager and part-
owner of a station on the Barwon. Last year,
while on a visit there, I queried —“Who is the
old man that lives in the cottage below the gate?”
His answer is my yarn ;—“ During the ’9O strike
an old fellow called at the office for rations.
Worried by those blessed shearers I told him to
go to the devil, and, a moment later, thought no
more about him. That day I went to the boun-
dary-fence on the Angledool side, and almost
immediately after starting home down went my
horse, and—well, I remember no more. A couple
of hours before sundown old Jenkins found me,
doctored me up as well as he could, and then
walked back to the station for assistance, full 20
miles, though he had not had a feed for two days.
Anyway, he saved my life, and here he is, and
here he will, be while 1 have a say in the station,”
—Tim Bobbin.
on satire;
When Satire bends her supple bow
And pours her arrows on the foe,
Why dost thou whine and whimper so
From weary day to day ?
The shafts that fly at Wiong’s command
With falsehood tipped by Error’s hand
Will idly fall and play ;
But When the darts are barbed with truth
And winged with wit -then, then , in sooth,
And only then they slay.

I could be christened to-night in the new faith of
manliness;
I am tired of the old rant and its bigotry ;
Under the stars and the sun I would be roaming
in freedom.
To-day and to-morrow may wear out the heart of
this impulse;
To-day and to-morrow will wear out a thousand of
such.
Poor dreamers for liberty! —children whose self is
their trouble!
Now in the passionate heat, here heart to heart
with my love,
We would be baptised in freedom—children of
song—
Children of toil, children of hope, manhood’s
defenders.

Apropos of the tendency of the Chinese to
leprosy, the power of the race-factor in disease is
not so well recognised as it should be. Here are
a few points. Although the Chinese are very
subject to leprosy, they withstand consumption to
a marked extent, and largely escape the common
contagious diseases. Semitic peoples are peculiarly
prone to cancer and melancholia, but curiously
exempt from ordinary communicable diseases.
The Teutonic nations are extremely subject to
scrofula and consumption. The Eskimo will
perjsh of consumption if brought even a little way
south of his usual habitat. The negro is exceed-
ingly subject to pneumonia, no matter what
climate he is in. The negro has another curious
point about him: though almost exempt from
malarial disease while in Africa, he yet succumbs
very easily to it in America and elsewhere. This
racial factor in disease demands careful study;

THE THREE AGES OF A PEER.
Three ages hath my lord; With aim sublimi
He gaily spendeth all his youthful time
preparing for his functions as a peer
J3y studies based on billets-doux and
The while he plots a gorgeous life and gay,
And paints the future bright with deep vermilion
ray.
Then manhood dawns. Straightway he plunges in
A header in the surging sea of sin ;
Riots and roams and revels where he will,
His only aim to feast, to feed, and swill;
Runs through the range of sins and finds them
few,
Then weeps—“ Alas I Oan none invent a vice
that’s new ?”
Then age creeps in. And now he doth repent
His youthful days in sinful pleasaunce spent;
Betaketh him to church with solemn air
And lifteth up to heaven the pious prayer;
Outpours his soul in sycophantic praise,
And dedicates to heaven the dotage of his days.
Q.
P. LUETIG.
An English weekly tells a thrilling story of
the Czarewitch’s recent visit. It seems that when
the Russian personage was served with tea in a
Royal Pavilion he took a little cream as well
as lemon in his cup. The exact quantities of
cream and lemon juice are not reported, but they
must have been carefully calculated, for when a
certain Princess asked the Ozarewitch if his tea
was agreeable, he replied: “This vosky Anglo
ILK. is chic utchen kereshaw —dobra, dobra ! ”
The human interest of the narrative doesn’t end
there. After the heir to the Russian Throne had
spoken those remarkable words, his evidence was
corroborated in a pithy manner by Prince Dimitri
Galitzine, who also said “Dobra kereshaw.” The
incident recalls a memorable occasion when Parkes
and Dibbs attended a political gathering and were
supplied with champagne in a tent. A waiter
asked Parkes if he liked the brand, and the hairy
potentate answered ; “ It is 0.K., but dry—very.”
Dibbs likewise withdrew his lips from the margin
of the glass to remark “ Very dry ! ’’
The successful removal of Piles of the
most stubborn description is being effected by
Sharp’s new “ Cannalin ” treatment, large quan-
tities of which are being forwarded to sufferers
throughout the colonies.
The Horn scientific expedition to Central
Australia reports having found a barking or
whistling spider. Now, the inevitable Queens-
lander comes along with a rival story of a barking
snake. The Queenslander always goes one better
when there is any animal perjury to be done, and,
in the matter of alligators, snakes, centipedes,
mosquitoes, blow-flies, scorpions, and every kind
of unpleasant squashy insect he keeps ahead of
creation. Yet a man may live for many months
in the Far North and be troubled by nothing
worse than cockroaches. A wooden house in a
N.Q. coast town is the most cockroach-infested
spot in all the universe. The horny insects come
out at dusk and swarm over the walls and roof
and floor, until there is one cockroach standing on
every square inch of space, and the last billion
cockroaches are crowded out into the back-yard.
You can’t throw a quart of boiling water at the
walls any time between sunset and sunrise with-
out bringing down 70 of them. The snake aspect
of North Queensland has been considerably over-
done, while its cockroach aspect —which is really
almost the only aspect it has—is scarcely even
mentioned.

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1894.
Give Peace in Our Time, O Lord!
George Turner, the new leader of the Vic-
torian Opposition and prospective Premier,
has announced his policy, and consequently
the people have an opportunity to weigh him
against James Brown Patterson, and decide
which of the pair is the better fitted to save
a sorely-distracted country. Turner, judged
by his latest utterances, is pre-eminently a
“ safe ” man. Victoria has been cursed by
many safe men in the past, and, seemingly,
rather likes them than otherwise, so Turner
should prove a Premier after her own heart.
He belongs, so far as can be judged, to
that class which is averse to all “ revolu-
tionary schemes,” which objects to desperate
remedies at all times, and shrinks from
radical changes on the stereotyped pretence
that the time is “not ripe”—the class which
loves to go slow in the slow old way, and
to keep in the old, respectable groove, and
which talks much of the Constitution and
similar fetiches. Turner’s programme is of
the kind which appeals to the stout and
serious-minded citizen, and its main feature
is that the author of it wants peace in
his own time. The keynote of it will
be found in his utterance on the man-
hood - suffrage question. He believes in
the principle of One-man-one-vote as
devoutly as so unobtrusive a person can
believe in anything. But “ for the sake of
peace ” he is willing to compromise with the
old iniquity and give one vote for manhood
and one for property. And the inborn
weakness of the man is expressed in that one
clause —“ For the sake of peace.”
• • •
The peace for which Turner is willing to
give up his flabby convictions is, of course,
his own, and it is no part of his compact
with the country that he is to have peace.
No reformer of any note ever has, and if the
new leader desires such a thing he must
sacrifice the interests of Victoria to secure
it. What that country needs is a
statesman who loves fighting for its own
sake, and fighting against heavy odds for
preference. It has drifted into utter cor-
ruption for the sake of peace, and if it is to
continue peaceful it must continue cor-
rupt. It gave up the attempt to reform
its rotten Upper House, and the idea
of levying a heavy land-tax which would
burst up its big estates, and the One-
man-one-vote principle, and the absentee-
tax, and all the good features of the Credit
Foncier Bill, and the income-tax, and every
other reform which has been proposed of
recent years, because it was ruled by a series
of dull, tranquil politicians who wanted
peace above all things. And what it requires
now, more than anything else, is a demo-
cratic ruler who will get out of the old
grooves, and declare war against the old
fetishes, and break up the Sabbath calm of
its politics, and who is ready to try new and
even hazardous remedies, seeing that the dry-
rot of Victoria is past being cured by any
ordinary expedients.
* * *
Turner’s desire for peace overshadows all
the other features of his programme. He
approves of a tax on unimproved land-
values, but professes to be afraid that it can’t
be got into working order in time to afford
any immediate relief. Considering that Vic-
toria has a complete system of local govern-
ment, and that the local bodies have all the
necessary valuations already prepared for
their own purposes, it is probable that the
land value tax could be instituted with less
delay than any other, so that Turner’s
action in this case may also be set down to
his love of unbroken calm. The imposition
of a new land-tax would mean war to the
knife with the House of Land-owners, and
the Premier-that-may-be is not inclined that
way. He approves, also, in the same
theoretic fashion, of an income-tax, but he
considers that, in all probability, it will be
“unfavorably received,” therefore it, too, is
abandoned in the interests of peace. The
form of direct taxation which he regards as
least likely to arouse the antagonism of an
Assembly built largely on the plural votes of
discredited land-boomers, and a Council
elected on a purely property qualification, is
a tax on “assets”—in other words, an im-
post on everything which everybody owns
over and above his liabilities. Such a tax,
varying from a farthing up to a penny in the
£ according to the amount of the assets, will,
Mr. Turner calculates, realise about
£600,000 per annum. Also, he evidently
reckons that it is bad enough, and mean
enough, and sufficiently iniquitous to com-
mend itself to the most corrupt Legislature
in Australasia, and is likely to cause less dis-
turbance than anything else which can be
devised.
« • •
The advantages of this means of raising
revenue are so obvious that the assets-tax is
really a masterpiece of legal ingenuity.
Under it almost all the land-boomers who
have not yet filed their schedules or com-
pounded for in the £, will escape abso-
lutely, for they mostly have paper liabilities
vastly in excess of their belongings. It is
true that these belongings, in some cases,
are really considerable, and that in most
instances the owners have no earthly inten-
tion of paying their liabilities ; but mean-
while the balance is on the wrong side, and
they will therefore go free. An enormous
proportion of the land-speculators and syndi-
cates and landlords who are not going either
to file their schedules or compound with
their creditors will also go free, or nearly so ;
land and bricks and mortar are now so low
in value that a very small overdraft or mort-
gage is a sufficient set-off against a very large
amount of property, and in these times the
man who can’t make his mortgage appear
as full value against his property is a
financier of very small account. The
shareholders in many reasonably prosperous
concerns will likewise pay nothing on their
investments. The ordinary shares of the
Bank of Victoria, for instance, though they
pay regular dividends of 5 per cent., are
almost valueless on the Stock Exchange,
because no one, in these times of scarcity,
cares for an investment which carries a heavy
liability in calls ; therefore, though they re-
turn some 50 or 70 per cent, on the present
market price, they have practically no tax-
able value whatever. The ordinary share-
holder in the Commercial of Australia,
Colonial, or City of Melbourne, will go
free for similar reasons. All the immense
properties held by the dozens of land banks,
building societies, and similar institutions in
liquidation will pay not one solitary copper,
for not one of these wrecks can show
a surplus over its paper liabilities. The land
and building societies which still keep afloat
are mostly in the same situation, or nearly
so. The big life-insurance societies will
also go practically untouched, for the insur-
ance society, by allotting its profits in
bonuses, keeps its liabilities and its assets
to all intents and purposes on a level, and its
surplus is never worth mentioning. The
person whom the tax will strike, how-
ever, is the honest man who has kept
clear of debt and abjured the miry
ways of finance. The artisan or shop-
keeper or small farmer who has struggled
to pay his way under all manner of difti-
culties will be taxed on all his possessions
down to the last farthing, simply because he
has paid everybody and his assets are con-
sequently all surplus ; while the insolvent
potentate in a mansion, simply because he
has paid nobody, will set off his debts against
his luxurious belongings and be exempt.
The assets tax will probably strike a smaller
proportion of politicians and “represen-
tative ” Victorians than any other kind of
direct impost that can be imagined, and
therein lies its great recommendation to a
peaceful politician who hates turmoil above
all things. The fact that it will involve at
least ten times as much time and labor to
get the necessary valuations made, and the
departmental machinery in order, than would
be required in the case of a land-tax, is too
trivial to be worth mentioning.
• * *
The rest of Turner’s policy is constructed
with the same profound regard for calm and
rest and an absence of unconstitutional dis-
order. Shiels’ successor proposes to borrow
£500,000 per annum and spend it on “bene-
ficial works.” The fact that the province
has borrowed far too much already, and
that it ought to construct all its public works
in future out of revenue, pervades the con-
science of every politician like an unquiet
ghost, but there is a period of dreadful
collapse to be gone through before Victoria,
or any other of the Australias, can get rid of
the incubus of foreign capital, and Turner
proposes to have peace in his own time, and
leave the great trouble to those who come
after him. He is in favor of female suffrage
—with a plural vote for the female with
property. He is also in favor of a State
Bank, though it is commonly rumored that
his State Bank is to be created by taking
over and amalgamating several dry-rotted
private institutions on terms which will save
much unpleasant investigation hereafter.
This idea may be incorrect, but it certainly
exists, and owing to its existence the Fat
Man does not look so unkindly on Turner’s
State Bank as might be expected. Further,
he approves of Patterson’s Cheap Money
project 'with certain modifications, which,
however, will not prevent the Credit Foncier
lending money in large sums at low interest
to Melbourne speculators, so that the agricul-
turist, for whose relief it was originally pro-
posed, will probably be left about where he
was, because the “shindykit” will get there
before him and take all that is going. Also,
he believes in the establishment by law of a
fixed minimum wage, and is in favor of
opening museums and libraries on Sunday,
and thus shedding a ray of light on the
desolate Sabbatarianism of Victoria, which
are the only two definite ideas of a demo-
cratic semblance in his policy ; and he
objects strongly to the totalisator, with a
due regard to the fact that bookmakers are a
clamorous race and likely, if aroused, to
seriously disturb his repose. Altogether,
Turner appears before the public as a rather
meek and commonplace attorney who means
as well as he thinks it safe to do —in which
respect he compares favourably with Patter-
son, who is a weak butcher who means
badly, and with Shiels, who is a weak
barrister who doesn’t know what he means.
But the occasion wants a man of genius, and
Turner, so far as he can be estimated, is
only an outline.
Is Bimetallism a Remedy?
Dear Bulletin,— Australia, in common with
many other countries, is heavily in debt to Great
Britain. If not within measurable distance, we
are within a conceivable distance of the time
when payment of interest and principal will be a
physical impossibility, except upon one assump-
tion. This is that the mass of workers will be
content to toil longer iiours and live upon a
bare subsistence, leaving the bulk of their
earnings to be mopped up by the usurer. With
manhood suffrage already a fact, and with
womanhood suffrage treading close upon its
heels, with tiie rising tide of Democracy and
the fierce onslaught upon privilege which is its
distinguishing characteristic, this assumption
may be dismissed at once.
• • •
H, M. Winthrop, in a recent Bulletin,
under-estimated rather than over-estimated
Australia’s indebtedness to Great Britain. If
the private indebtedness is included the amount
is very considerably under-estimated. The
actual position of the indebted countries is
fairly stated by him. Taking Australia
as an example, we borrowed certain sums
in gold for the use of which we agreed
to pay a yearly tribute called interest at a
fixed rate, also in gold. Of course, we did
not receive gold when we borrowed. And we
do not, in the majority of instances, remit gold
when we pay the interest. We send a quantity
of our staple products which, at the current
prices, will equal the amount of the interest
due.
« • •
That, from our point of view, we made a bad
bargain is undeniable. But the badness of the
bargain consists not in our agreeing to pay
a fixed rate in gold, but in our agreeing to pay
a fixed rate in anything. It is a mere accident,
so far as the transaction is concerned, that there
has been a general fall in prices. If we had
agreed to pay a fixed number of bales of wool,
or of tons of silver, it would have been a bad
bargain for the lender. So also it would have
been a bad bargain for him if there had been a
general rise in prices.
• * «
Yet, in either case, is the bargain so bad as it
looks ? If there has been a general fall in
prices, then all the commodities which we
import, everything upon which we subsist while
producing our staple products, and the
machinery which we use in producing them,
have also fallen in price. It is true we have to
send away more produce now for the same
value in gold than formerly ; but so, also, we
receive more in exchange for every sovereign
we earn. lam disposed, therefore, more and
more to fall back upon the conclusion that the
bargain is a bad one, not because of the appre-
ciation of gold, or, in other words, because of a
general fall in prices, but because we agreed to
pay a fixed rate. Going still deeper to the
root of the matter, the trouble is, that in pav-
ing interest, we are paying something for which
we get absolutely nothing in exchange.
• * *
Still, the bargain has been struck, and if it is
a bad one we must make the best of it. Will
bimetallism help us ? Is it, for this purpose, an
intelligible proposal? “ What is it you want ?”
was asked of a leading bimetallist in South
Australia. “ Will you be content to have the
free coinage of silver, just as there is now the
free coinage of gold?” “Oh, no,” was his
reply, “we want both linked together in a cer-
tain specified ratio, say as Ito 15.” Let us for
a moment admit that this is possible. How
will that help us in regard to fixed payments
which we have already agreed to make in gold?
Obviously the other party to the contract will
bind us to the letter of it so long as it pays him
to do so. When it does not pay him, and a
silver standard would suit him better, \\ 7 e
should have to keep to the gold standard.
Besides, the contention is that bimetallism
would cause a rise in prices. If so, it would
work to the disadvantage of those who are
receiving fixed payments in gold. And, more-
over, bimetallism would be useless unless Great
Britain would adopt it, and it is not very likely
she would, if, as would be the case upon this
assumption, it meant a heavy loss to her.
* • #
As a prominent bimetallist plainly put it,
bimetallism means partial repudiation. If that
is what we are aiming at, and it is to that we
shall come, why not go a more direct way to
work ? Why not adopt the proposal made in The
Bulletin several months ago ? When a loan
falls due, instead of trying to float a reconver-
sion loan, out of wdiich the financial sharks get
a good picking, why not take the bull by the
horns ? Why not say to the foreign creditor,
We cannot pay you any longer 4 per cent. We
will give you fresh bonds for the amount due,
upon which we will pay you 2 per cent. If you
don’t care to take that, you must do the best
you can.” Of course, such a step would put a
stop to all borrowing in the future. This would
be the very best thing that could happen to
Australia. Our loans have created a fictitious
prosperity, have inflated land-values, have en-
couraged reckless speculation, and have brought
us to the verge of ruin.
• • *
Leaving out of question existing obligations
to pay in gold, how far would bimetallism be a
remedy for our chronic depression ? Is it
possible to have two standards of value always
bearing the same ratio to each other? Of course
it is not. But, even if it were, and the effect
were to raise all prices, the wage-earner would
be the first to suffer, as the purchasing power
of his wages would be reduced. Then, if there
are to be two standards of value, who is to have
the option of saying which standard he will
use ? The effect would be to create two prices
for everything—so much in gold and so much
in silver. But the ordinary wage-earner and
the man in receipt of a small fixed salary, who
could not afford to wait, would always be paid
according to the least valuable standard. And,
according to Gresham’s law, the inferior cur-
rency would displace the superior one for general
use.
• • •
The whole confusion arises from the assump
tion that Parliament has fixed the price of gold.
It has done nothing of the sort. The value of
a sovereign, measured by any other standard,
say tea, wool, butter, eggs, etc., varies from
day to day. All that Parliament has done for
several centuries —for the Imperial Acts dealing
with the currency have varied but little from
the first—is to provide that the mint will take
your gold, reduce it to; the standard value of
eleven-twelfths pure gold and one-twelfth alloy,
and give you in exchange for it as many
sovereigns as it will make. A sovereign is
merely a piece of gold of a specified fineness and
bearing upon it the certificate of the mint. If
Parliament has never attempted to fix the value
of gold how could it sqcceed in fixing the re-
lative value of gold and Silver ? Bimetallism is
mere quackery. It would provide no remedy
for existing obligations. It would render
future transactions more complex, and when
that is the case the producer and the worker
are the first to suffer.
* # #
In playing euchre it is customary to mark
the points by the pips of the cards. Suppose a
new method of marking were adopted, and that
for a single point a red card were used, and for
a march a black card. The player would gain
nothing by the change if his opponent had the
joker and the two bowers. The borrower is ser-
vant to the lender, and would be so just as much
under bimetallism as he is under monometallism.
It is the borrowing that must be stopped, and
some compromise must be made with regard to
existing obligations. And it is high time for us
to look these facts squarely in the face. Our
great trouble is not the mode of measuring
values. It is that so large a proportion of the
commodities thus measured is claimed for rent
and interest. The tribute payable on our
National Debt is only a part of a difficulty
which is becoming more serious every day.
J. MEDWAY DAY.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
M.’sP. as Voting Machines.
Dear Bulletin, —Will you allow me to add a
few further arguments to your editorial reply
to “A. M‘Lean ”in a recent issue ? To begin,
there are a number of unthinking persons
abroad who gauge the political capacity of a
man by the number of divisions he piles up,
not by the intelligence he displays. A close
knowledge of how votes are given may enlighten
these individuals as to the true value of a vote.


BS== like the last New South Wales
deliberating in a small Chamber, the
ar e rather in the direction of
* D . ting from fb® hot and vitiated atmosphere
r ® tl ® a Clr^ n:, t >er to t^ie co a * r t '* ie balconies
0 i ■ iterooins, so that small attendances and
aIUI a quorums were the rule and crowded
niches the exception. Further, to an in-
n ctual man, it must be a positive infliction
t 8 listen to yards of drivel from certain
t 0 .. kers who believe the country is listening
®P ea t heir crude opinions freely given on all
* or tions. When the division-bell rings an in-
? U lheenb man, having in a few moments gauged
i importance of the question ; having learned
tlie jj 0 f the drift of debate to know that the
on the difference between Tweedledum
V ° Cfweedledee, and having no desire to pile
in the division lists, would naturally
U P - n j n the library or reading-rooms, and
ren ‘ t [ ie decision to those who have a morbid
living for record-breakings. Meanwhile, the
titer rush in from everywhere, knowing nothing
about the subject, and simply go to the right
the left as their party-leaders go. No one
0 u id blame these individuals for remaining
W °t of the Chamber until the bell rang, because
° close attendance would lead to brain-softening,
a -cept in cases where that catastrophe had
actually happened prior to their entrance to
tl e House. Take G. D. Clark as an example
[ successful record-breaking—in speeches as
° ell as divisions. He is an amiable, well-
meaning, but mediocre man. It is an ascer-
tained fact, nowadays, that political reputa-
tions are made, as a rule, by those who devote
themselves to special branches of study.
Specialism is the great drift of modern life,
al ,d this holds good in politics. I forget who
said that a politician should not only know
something about everything, but that he also
should know everything about something. The
man who masters one or two subjects is the
useful, and generally the successful politician.
The gift is rare which makes a man a great
authority on such divergent subjects as Finance
and Theology, Bi-metallism and the Eastern
Question, Greek poetry and Irish affairs—as in
the case of Mr. Gladstone. Mr. G. D. Clark,
who seems to be Mr. M‘Lean’s idol of admira-
tion—and Mr. M‘Lean belongs to a large
class who want the worth of their money in
divisions from a democratic member —Mr.
Clark attacks with perfect freedom and con-
fidence Banking Laws, the Land Question,
Public Finance, Water Supply Bills, Temporary
Supply Bills, railway management, the question
of Law Vacations, Bankruptcy Acts and the
Chemistry of Alcohol —his remarks upon any
one of these subjects being as valuable as upon
any other of them. Indeed, he might have
used the same speech on every occasion, with
an alteration of names. Yet Mr. Clark was
held up, and is still regarded, as a model for
imitation; and, in order to share the encomiums
showered upon him, other members imperilled
their common sense by dividing the House
unnecessarily to swell their own division
records. The record speech-maker and the
record division-maker I place upon the same
level as the man who undertakes for a wager to
drink so many long beers, or eat so many pork-
pies in a given time. Let me say a few words
here about that other cognate idea of paying a
member for attendances, instead of making an
annual salary. The idea is based upon an
insensate craving for quantity rather than
quality. I am strongly of opinion that the
occasional attendance of one really able man
may be of more public service than the regular
roll-up of a million mediocrities. You will
remember how Whistler, the painter, pub it
when cross-examined as to the value of one of
his celebrated “ Nocturnes.” He admitted
that it had only taken him two days to paint
the picture ; he also admitted that he
valued it at 200 guineas. When asked did
he think 200 guineas a reasonable rate for
two days’ work, he replied—“ Yes, when
it embodies the experience of a life-time.”
So it is in politics. The mere payment for the
evening’s attendance, at which an able and
capable man delivers the concentrated wisdom
and experience of a lifetime, is a poor recom-
pense. A speech on a great subject may have
Involved years of continuous reading and ob-
servation, backed up by natural capacity and
special aptitude. Finally, these division and
speech-lists are the deplorable result of the
centralised administrative system under which
New South Wales totters. Nine out of every
den of the questions which occupy the House
ought to be thrashed out in local-governing
'bodies, municipal councils, or divisional boards.
The debates on a bridge over Tin-Pot Greek,
The appointment of a policeman at Ballybud-
;geree, or the construction of a road in the
Bunglebung electorate are the opportunities for
: small men to get up big averages. At that time
the Traills quit the chamber, and make way
for the G. D. Clarks and other record-
breakers. The moral of Mr. M'Lean’s com-
ments is that the average Labor Electoral
League crowd are more exacting to their
political servants than the hated capitalists to
theirs. They are, in short, political sweaters.
—Yours truly, Democrat.
What Patterson Has Done.
A list of things that Patterson, the strong-
man, has done for Victoria should be printed
and posted upon every public building in the
country for the country’s good. His Ministry
existed for 18 months only, but his greatest
achievements are already forgotten. Patterson
started by “cordially co-operating” with the
banks that went bung, and whilst those insti-
tutions were coming to grief he made a
gorgeous ass of himself by ordering a seven
days’ bank holiday, which order was dis-
regarded entirely by two British banks whereby
they obtained a large advt. at the expense of
their “colonial” rivals. Previous to this,
Patterson had raised barrister Madden to the
Chief Justiceship at one bound, and to this
new-made dignitary fell the task of sanctioning
sundry reconstructions, with a result that has
yet to be fully appreciated. For the Davies
nolle prosequi, and other legal proceedings
leading up to the acquittal of that famous
financier, Patterson’s Government can take
all the credit it chooses. Also, the scandal
associated with the non-prosecution of some
other financiers should properly be mentioned
among the things Patterson did. Another
Patterson feat was the billeting of Gillies
upon the country as Agent-General, after he
(P.) had not only gloried in his intention to
leave the post vacant, but had actually sent
Robert Reid to London with alleged instruc-
tions to the acting Agent - General. For
the rest of Reid’s mission it was pure bunkum,
and Patterson put a sum of .£6OO on the
estimates to defray the missionary’s personal
expenses. Finally, Patterson, assisted by
Carter, produced an inane, cowardly Budget
with a view to wiping out the deficit left by a
cowardly, inane Budget of the year before.
After taking back this second monstrosity in an
abject manner, Patterson lost his small work-
ing majority, and seized his opportunity to
appeal to the country. All these things, and
several others, the Castlemaine politician has
done. He spent a long recess in talking hollow
nonsense about the export of frozen meat,
cheese, butter, and eggs from Victoria, repre-
senting trades of the doubtful future as pros-
perous commercial ventures that would be
inaugurated at once with “Government assist-
ance.” Within a fortnight of his defeat he
voted for the Geelong land-sale job. Directly
or indirectly almost every member of the late
Ministry has proved his unfitness to occupy a
place of public trust.
♦
The Minimum Wage.
The announcement of the New South Wales
Minister of Works, that, in future, all Govern-
ment contractors will be required to pay not
less than a certain fixed minimum wage, is a
step towards the fixing of a minimum wage in
all industries, and, that being so, it is a move
which must commend itself to every Democrat.
As usual, the Sydney Telegraph, which is a
Democratic journal in the hazy abstract,
but which objects to almost every Demo-
cratic idea in the concrete, generally on
the ground that it isn’t Democratic enough,
rises to object. The basis of the Telegraph’s
objection is remarkable. When Minister Young
announced his new departure, a'gaudy political
ass arose in the Assembly and inquired whether
the Government would fix a minimum selling
price for maize and other products, so that the
farmer might also have a minimum wage. Then
a loud horse-laugh went round the House, and
the minimum wage idea was understood to
be altogether extinguished. The Telegraph
now seriously argues that the State has no right
to abolish the infamous sweating system which
prevails on Govt, contracts, unless it is prepared
to fix a minimum wage and a minimum price
for everything. In other words, the Govern-
ment must not begin to undo a great evil unless
it can undo the whole evil at once, and as it
can’t undo it all at once the evil must be left
entirely alone. The species of democrat who
opposes the first instalment of reform because
he wants the entire animal or nothing always
gets nothing, and knows that he will always get
nothing, and knowing it he is the worst of all
snags in the path of progress. Whether the
minimum wage idea will work or not can only be
ascertained by experiment, but at all events
the experiment is worth trying. The dogmatic
assumption that it will not work because it is
opposed to the eternal law of demand and
supply is no evidence, because no one really
knows for certain whether there is any cast-
iron law of demand and supply at all. There
is a demand for many things the supply of
which has been shut down upon by the State,
without visible injury to anybody, and the
bottom having fallen out of the alleged
economic law to such an extent, it is quite
possible that it can stand a good deal of further
damage without any serious consequences
arising.
Commercial Morality.
A good opportunity will soon present itself for
some solid Democratic work a little out of
the beaten track. Hitherto democrats have
neglected private law, though its influence on
everyday life and happiness is enormous. Last
February the Sale of Goods Act passed in Eng-
land. It is really a code of all the decisions
since Charles ll.’s time on that notorious
advt. of the inherent dishonesty of the English
commercial classes, known as the Statute of
Frauds. Every line of this Statute has been
gushingly declared to be worth a subsidy, and,
the cynics add, has cost a subsidy. One of its
sections is perhaps our only legacy from the
gangrenous commercialism of Carthage. How-
ever, the code is well done, and long-needed.
Some of its sections crystallise into statutory
form the infamous British commercial doctrine,
known as “Caveat Emptor,” which means,
roughly, that in all transactions between mer-
chant and customer, the customer has to take
all the risk. The opposite doctrine, that the
man who knows all about the goods should take
the risk of their being what he represents them
to be, was the rule in the Roman markets, and,
as a consequence, the modern troubles about
adulteration and false representations as to
the quality of goods were practically unknown
to the Romans. The maxim is the token of the
subjection to the shopkeeping class of the
interests of their customers— i.e., the com-
munity. It is a privilege of the strong
against the weak, of. the wily against the
trusting, of the prosperous against the neces-
sitous. It bobs up its head when you
try to get your money back from the tobac-
conist who sold you a bad plug, or from the
machinery merchant who has supplied you with
a “ cronk ” threshing-machine. It is the foun-
dation-stone of the commercialism whose dry-
rot is dragging Britain down. To say that to
abolish it would probably make us a non-trading
community should be sufficient warrant for far-
sighted Democrats to consider the advisability
of abolishing it. And it can be done by wiping
out these sections when the Sale of Goods Bill
is brought before Australian Parliaments, and
by asserting the opposite principle in less than
a dozen words. The Victorian Parliament is
already circulating the Bill, but the probability
is that, as usual, important domestic legislation
will be allowed to be passed holus-bolus by the
Upper House, with, perhaps, an addition or two
by way of piling up future bills of costs by the
lawyers of the Lower House, while the so-called
Labour members are enjoying a nap on the
cushions, or a nip at the bar. It’s no good
passing health acts, adulteration acts, mar-
garine acts, trade-mark acts, while this nefari-
ous principle continues part of the law. They
are so much waste paper. And those who hate
commercialism—and they are all true patriots—
should know that this is one of its vitals, and is
within shot.
That more or less democratic organ, Sydney
Truth, has decided, after much uncertainty,
that payment of members is “humiliating to
the national pride, belittling to the dignity of
Parliament, and a death-blow to the usefulness
and dignity of the New South Wales Assembly.”
The <£3oo a year, it alleges, “has caused an
insensate rush of labouring-men for the new
avenue of employment,” and the paid member
sacrifices his convictions “ because he cannot
cut the Government’s throat without cutting
his own.” Under these painful conditions the
paper suggests the adoption of Parkes’s
famous device that members should be nomin-
ally unpaid, but that every M.L.A. should
be entitled to his annual wage on his
making oath that he cannot live in
Parliament without it. How this would
alter the position no intelligent person
can see, for the ruffianly crowd which Truth
depicts as rushing for a parliamentary billet
and a salary would rush just the same, and get
its salary just the same ; it would merely be a
matter of making a declaration, and if the
Labour politician is one-tenth as bad as he is
represented he would cheerfully make fifty
declarations, supposing they were required.
The proposed arrangement is simply that no
member shall be paid unless he asks for the
money, and no member is paid now unless he
asks for the money. If he doesn’t ask for it, it
is kept in the State Treasury. Up to date,
however, every member save two (Bruce Smith
and Knox) has asked for it religiously, and
the country in general is pleased with the
result. What it is afraid of is not the politician
who is paid by the Treasury, but the one
who pays himself by using his parliamentary
position as an advertisement for his private
undertakings. And it notes with interest that
many o*f the politicians who object most strongly
to payment of members are the ones who have
lately come nearest to losing their positions
through the inrush of a new class of candidates,
whose existence in the old days was an impos-
sibility. To any clever and struggling solicitor,
say, a seat in Parliament is worth perhaps £lOOO
a year in the business it brings to the legal mill,
and there is no joy in getting £3OO a year added
on to that ,£lOOO, if the result is that the
whole £l3OO is lost at next election. It is not
merely a case of dropping the bone to grasp at
the shadow ; there is no option in it, for the
shadow actually comes along and takes the
bone away.
There are in S.A., in addition to the Village
Settlements, 3059 workingmen’s blocks contain-
ing 43,196 acres and yielding £3549 to the
State in annual rent, the average being Is.
6|d. per acre. The population of these blocks
numbers 10,487 men, women and children.
Since 1885, when the system first started, the
rent received has amounted to £15,182 18s. Id.,
and on July 31 only £587 lid. was in arrear,
while on the total Government advance of
£9OOO only £l2 Is. lOd. in interest was out-
standing on the same date. These are official
figures, and they prove that the industrious
artisan is much better pay, even to the State,
which is not given to pressing its creditors,
than the Banks or their reputedly wealthy
overdrafters. Tom Price is the first genuine
S.A. blacker to get into Parliament, though Tom
Brooker is also partly dependent on his home-
stead allotment.
The end of the second Speight v. Syme libel-
action is at hand at time of writing, but the
contesting parties gaze wearily around at a
half-empty court. Their deadly struggle has
outlived even Victorian public interest in it,
and they feel like two pugilists
fighting to a finish in the centre of a sandy
desert with an ounce of liniment at stake. One
day last week Speight’s counsel made the
pathetic announcement that his worn-out client
would resign all hope of damages if the ex-
hausted Age proprietor would withdraw his
remarks and pay the expenses that have arisen
from them. He was as one crying aloud in the
wilderness. Nobody felt excited by an offer
which might have set a hundred thousand
tongues wagging only nine brief months ago.
It was again remarked by Speight’s counsel
that the author of the Age’s railway revela-
tions had never been produced, nor had a
knowledge of his identity been admitted by a
witness, but the outside world has ceased to
notice this peculiar circumstance. The man
officially responsible for Speight’s dismissal has
vanished into space, as it were. His name was
Wheeler, and he ordered the railway receipts
to be increased by £lOO,OOO a year. Who was
this same mad wag Wheeler? Subsequent
events have obliterated him from the public
memory. The most important surroundings of
the Speight v. Syme case are well-nigh for-
gotten, opinions once formed upon its merits
have been lost sight of, and people who started
bv supporting one side are under a mistaken
impression that they want the other side to win.
In Norway, drink, under the Gotheuberg
licensing system, is mainly a State monopoly.
The right to sell it is farmed out to private com-
panies who are only permitted to make some
Bor 10 per cent, on their capital; the surplus
goes to the State. The companies, having
nothing to gain by pushing the drink business,
or by making, extraordinary profits, have no
reason to adulterate their liquor, consequently
fusel oil is an unknown quantity in Norway.
As an additional inducement, in every public-
house the co.’s sell food and temperance
drinks for their own exclusive benefit, and
therefore they have every reason to sell the
best liquor and to promote the comfort of their
patrons in order to attract business to their
own little private enterprise. As the result
the Norwegian pub. is a model of neatness and
comfort, the drinks are of the best, the com-
panies earn a respectable dividend, and the
State nets some £BO,OOO per annum. Also, in
91, there were only four cases of delirium
tremens among 2,000,000 Norwegians, only
eight cases of chronic drunkenness, and only 63
cases of brain-disease ascribable to alcohol.
Compared with these results, prohibition may
take the most remote back seat upon record.
It is the favourite assumption in the importers’
organs of Sydney that Premier Patterson is
fighting the Victorian election on a Freetrade
basis, or something approaching thereto, and
that the infuriated brandisher of the meat-axe
is a convert to the only true faith. The following
is Patterson’s own statement on the subject:—
This increase in production, together with the fall in
prices already mentioned, has made it absolutely neces-
sary to relieve the producing interest from every burden
that may be oppressive to it; and the Government claim
a mandate from the electors to reduce, without interfering
with the Protective policy cf the country, such prohibi-
tive duties as have severely affected revenue and com-
merce, and have also prevented our Protective duties from
producing those benefits which they were intended to
confer.
The Bulletin will be glad to meet someone
who can say exactly what the above statement
means, or what it doesn’t mean, or if it means
anything at all. On the surface it only seems
to" convey that Patterson will kind of sit
around in an unobtrusive fashion till he knows
what is going to happen, and will lurk round
the corner, so to speak, and that he is endea-
voring to come in out of the wet. The situation
is unsettled, so Patterson retires in a vague
cloud of meat and loose vocabulary till things
develope a little more, and then he will emerge
and champ his corrugated jaw as usual.
A New Australian Magazine.
Criticism of “Cosmos,” latest and crudest of the
failures to found an Australian magazine, would
be unkind if distant readers might not in default
of repudiation deem this failure representative.
But the name of Australia must not be taken in
vain. It is not fair to saddle the emu with pre-
tentious dullness, or thekangaroo with amateurish
incapacity. One expects “an illustrated Aus-
tralian magazine ’’ to rise above the level of daily-
newspaper hack-work, and “Cosmos,” for the
most part, wallows resolutely in the slough.
Printing is by no means first-class, writing is
second-rate with occasional lapses to fourth-rate,
and editing somewhere about tenth-rate.
Now, The Bulletin stands ready and eager to
welcome Australian talent, from whatever source
arising. But how is it possible to welcome “an
illustrated magazine ’’ which introduces itself with
a “Poem—To Australia,” including lines like
these:—
From small beginninsrs has the “Cosmos” sprung,
And with it’s life and influence scarce begun
It s future reign cannot as yet be seen,
And yet—why should not what before has been
Be once again ? And from a seedling tome
By patient energy upreared, as Rome
Was built, why should there not arise a pow’r
For something more than whiling past an hour?
Or rather why, within this Austral land,
Should not success attend the willing hand?
One can imagine indignant Australia rising just
here to put across her knee this childish poet—
who spells “its” “it’s” and rhymes “sprung”
with “begun”—and spank him soundly before
sending him back to the nursery.
Ex poeta libellum. A writer on “Sir Alfred
Stephen” plods leaden-footed through what
should have been a bright subject.
story of “The Shilling Reef” is not in his
best vein. A smart sixth-form boy might be
proud of the insipid essay by Mr. Arthur
Galton on the basis of poetry, which does not
reassure one concerning the safety of “The
History of N.S. Wales.” Talmage, hastily
nobbled, utters dithyrambic bathos about his
Australian trip. Two tales which follow are
better passed in silence. “Psychic Force,” by
Dr. M'Carthy, is an interesting description of
local experiences in spiritualism, which only
needed a little judicious trimming to be good.
“ About Lady Journalists, by One of Them,” is a
bit of ingenious scribbling*, full of the deliciously
feminine spite which makes editors so cynical
about woman suffrage. “ The Woman’s Depart-
ment,” by Ethel S. Turner, shows art and re-
straint, and contains what are, from a literary
point of view, the most creditable pages of
the magazine. Of the illustrations, some are
fair, and some are —not fair. The interspersed
verse consists of flavorless rhyming echoes like
scores which pass monotonously through every
office every week on their way to dusty death._
On the whole, the best thing in “ Cosmos ” is an
advertisement with a picture of “Psyche.” There
is some soul in Psyche.
It would appear from this commentary that
“Cosmos”—why “Cosmos,” by the way?—has
been born very young. That is a fact, though
there is consolation in the corollary that it will die
very young, like the other wild flowers which
spring has brought us. There is “ not wit_ enough
to keep it sweet;” and the prohibition to infringe
copyright is fantastic supererogation.
The future Australian magazine—and it is
bound to come soon—will begin where the Cen-
tennial Magazine left off. “ Cosmos ” begins
away down below the Centennial Magazine.
The future Australian magazine will pay for
everything. “Cosmos ” has paid for hardly any-
thing. Good writers will not work unpaid, and
the gifts of duffers and Danai are equally deadly.
The future Australian magazine will not sta,nd,
like “ Cosmos,” on the plea that it is Australian.
It will stand on its merits. The future Australian
magazine will be edited with brains and a big
blue pencil. You may search Sydney and Mel-
bourne vainly for half-a-dozen men who can do
their best work to order. Yu i will not get one
who does not need occasional pruning. And it is
no use starting unless you can see your way at
least six months ahead. A hand-to-mouth policy
is fatal. Any time the last ten years has been
ripe for a good Australian magazine. It only
wants the man —and the money.
Editor Bulletin,— What’s the matter
with Soudan warrior Shipway’s questions about
fortifications in N.S.W. Assembly? N.S. Wales
has no fortifications worth talking about. 1 ort
Jackson has been “fortified” on a cheap and
nasty principle suggested by one Moncrieff nearly
41 years ago, and even that system has not been
fully applied. The thousands of pounds spent on
the wretched things have been wasted, since a
company of marines with a field gun posted on
Dobroyde Mill would silence nearly every gun
round the harbor in half an hour, and then “the
enemy’’ could steam comfortably up to Circular
Quay. Then that fort at Newcastle has been
carefully planted in the middle of the town, so
that every shot from seaward that missed it would
go crashing among the houses, and consequently
the commander would have to choose between
abandoning his post and having the town
destroyed. If Shipway, M.P., would or could
expose and put an end to the waste of money on
these follies he would do some good.— PoHTFIHK.

My Dear Moorabinda—
Apropos of a ghastly drinking-story which is
going the rounds of Sydney at the expense of a
wrinkled old female tempter with a corkscrew,
men are credited with teaching us many bad
habits, but I really think, if statistics could be got,
it would be seen that it’s mostly women who show
women the drinking-trick. Little crony parties
beginning with tea and ending with undiluted
“ telegraph poles,” return more incoherent females
with loose bonnet-strings and opaline eyes to the
bosoms of their confiding families, than indifferent
ball-champagne and an encouraging partner ever
did or does. Even in the most whited sepulchre
of a house, where the little crony parties are run
on the strict Q.T., it’s fifty to one that after
decorously sipping tea out of china thimbles in
the drawing-room the hostess will take each
departing guest aside by the ear and murmur that
a suggestion of whisky-and-soda (“it’s just in the
dining-room”) will brace them up for the home
journey more than the conventional extract
of tannin. No wonder Mrs. Windeyer’s pet
scheme, the “ Home for Inebriate Women,” is
paying more than its washing-bills !
I am Irete reminded of a yarn about a deaf
woman who. was travelling per inter-Australian
steamboat not long ago. She occupied a lower
berth, and, with the aid of her ear-trumpet, held
conversations with the voyageuse on the top shelf
who soothed the pangs of mal de mer at frequent
intervals, before the bar closed. In the gloaming
one evening top-shelf ordered a bottle of ale, and,
leaning down, asked bottom-shelf if she wouldn’t
take a, drop. Upon which what looked like a
goblet in the dim light loomed up readily, and
into this top-shelf poured a liberal potion. Un-
earthly shrieks from beneath stopped tho foamy
deluge ! Top-shelf had been innocently tipping
the bottle into the ear-trumpet!
By the way, a Sydney man writes from the Vic-
torian Prohibition settlement drawing my
attention to the rules of a social club in
that region of ostensibly undiluted lemonade.
Rule 1. “ Ladies must not dance with gentlemen
under the influence of liquor.” Rule 2. “Any
lady detecting any gentleman under the influence
of liquor is requested to at once report the same
to the M.C.” But what a place Mildura must
be ! These two little rules seem to bring to light
every smuggled bottle of whisky in the settle-
ment.
People are on the jump to- know when the
marriage of Pooh Bah, the South Sea idol, and
his second venture is coming off ? By the way, it
was only very recently that the bride-to-be knew
she was filling the shoes, of another woman.—her
(let us say) Adonis not having thought it neces-
sary to mention that history was merely repeating
itself for him, when, he popped tho question.
Though, mipd you, the lady ought to have known
it without feeling, for experts say one can always
tell a widow.er, at the sticking-point. He is sure,
tpv. onp thing, that it’s a woman he’s got to deal
with, apd not an angel, which is the stumbling-
block of so many unpractisedyouths, though every
girl isn’t an expert, of course.
I cannot, help, thinking, though, what a
lovely set, of women, this particular bride elect’s
friends must be not to have told the Romeo’s
matrimonial performances as soon as his shadow
was seen in the east. I, would really like to make
a collection of women like those!
Melbourne’s own Dr. Bevan, of the benignant
lion expression, has been shaking his mane at the
“ Endeavouring Christians ” of Sydney and adver-
tising from the pulpit, “ Wanted, men with moral
courage,” who will be little wax George Washing-
tons in trade and always tell the truth and say to
their heathen employers who would have them lie
over the counter, “I cannot.” But what trans-
cendental nonsense ! Just figure out the
apotheosis of the beautiful truth ! With every-
body adhering strictly to facts what a deeply-
insulted world it would be !
Not only the man who sells you ootton-stoekings
for lisle thread, but absolutely everybody, would
be in the fracas, and the end of the experiment
would probably be a civil war. I don’t suppose
the reverend doctor himself would be overjoyed
to hear my honest opinion on the way he wears
his back hair, for instance, so until we scratch off
our veneer of civilisation and suavity and go back
to woad and unadorned verbal personalities it is
better to get along as we do with a suspicious eye
on our neighbor.
I don’t see much in children’s witticisms, as a
rule, but some bantlings do certainly give original
definitions of things. A small Australian, asked
what Lot’s wife was turned into, said, promptly,
“ A cocked hat.” The meaning of the word “ gen-
tleman” he discovered to be “ a man who carries a
stick,” and a dog was “an animal that you tie
up.” These significations seem to be more up to
date than the dictionary definitions.
Another small Sydneyite was made aware that
his mother was having a birthday and he had no
gift. After offering her, in vain, every toy in his
possession, he thought a moment, and then said,
hopefully, “ I know what I’ll do; I’ll take a dose
of castor-oil for you 1” Talk about the stuff mar-
tyrs are made of!
The race for the intercolonial ten-mile “ bike ”
championship took place on Sydney Association
Ground last Saturday. The severe tumbles
experienced by certain cyclists served to exhibit
Mr. Jones, of Maoriland, in a very pleasant light.
Mr. Jones saw the collision and stopped riding,
willing to let the race be run again; but a
hardened Sydney one-mile champion spurted past
the tangle of men and wheels as indifferently as a
steeplechase jockey, so the Quixotic Mr. Jones
took up the running again, in self-defence —and
won the race, as everybody knows.
The 10-mile affair was the sensational item on
the card, and the somersaulting cyclists made it
more so—added to which was the thrill of Mr.
Jones falling off his machine in a swoon after he
had won the final heat, for the public almost pre-
fers its winners to be carted off the track in-
sensible, if possible. It seems brutal to assert, but
a few croppers wake up a cycle meeting so un-
mistakeably that any spirited club ought always
to include one or two falls in the bill in the
interests of its patronesses. What looked like a
native-companions’ dance in black and white,
proved to be a sort of dumb-bell ballet by Y.M.C. A.
youths to the rhythm of the lawn band. .It was
neatly put on, and I was not surprised at the
excellent physique of the six-and-thirty toast-and-
water athletes. A man who lives according to
the menu of the Y.M.C.A. ought to be fit enough
to win a battle off his own racquet. A big crowd
filled the grand-stand, but one’s footsteps echoed
in the members’, which isn’t any wonder, for the
best view you get from thence is the backs of the
heads of the pen-gentlemen, who sit about a table
in the open like disciples at the last supper of
sport. The lawn was simply a mash of humanity,
in which one picked out individuals with difficulty.
Amid the tumultuous applause of a densely
crowded house —the audience flowing over on to
the rostrum and almost breathing down the plump
backs of Madame Urso, in blue satin and brocade,
and Madame Sapio, in white satin and pink
roses—the first series of Urso-Sapio concerts came
to an end in Sydney. I say the first series because
the management has every intention of paying a
return visit, if possible, and tho’ it is uncertain, at
time of writing, whether it will accept the
terms offered by Sydney Philharmonic, more
than probably it will give at least two more
concerts off its own bat. I think the U.S. tour
should be a moral lesson to all managers who go
round begging for patronage as though their little
Punch and Judy couldn’t stand up without Sir
Blanky Blank and party in the front chairs. The
Urso-Sapio co. runs simply on its high artistic
merits, and I was glad to see that Sydney society
doesn’t always wait to be given a vice-regal lead
where the arts are concerned. Certainly Lady
Duff and party went of their own free will one
evening, but as the co. had then fully caught on
the eleventh hourV.R. repentance didn’t affect its
success a little bit. By the way, Lord Hopetoun
blankly told the U.S. manager that he didn’t like
music, but I think if the gifted artistes had
brought themselves down to give an evening of the
Governor’s only favorite opera, Bizet’s “Carmen,”
his Ex. would have put in an appearance.
Fittingly enough a Y-shaped dress-circle patro-
nised Henry Vee at Sydney Majesty’s on Mon-
day, with the two vice-regal figure-heads in the
gubernatorial pen, escorted by most of the suite.
Lady Duff, in a creamy sort of dress, sported a
blue ribbon round her neck, in imitation of a
Derby winner, and Gov. Duff wore his ribbon
draped on the bias. The revival of Henry V.
was evidently regarded as an official fixture, for
** Uncle ” came sprinkled over with medals, and
ex-Premier Dibbs had left off his every-day
spectacles. From the manager’s box Mrs. Jenyns-
Wood gazed with retrospective expression upon
the “ boy ” played by little Adelaide Ogden, for
that loquacious brat was the first part Essie made
a hit in; and in the O.P. box ex-Premier Parkes
and his better half were effectively posed in the
full glare of the limelight. As a rule, Henry V.
absorbs all the radiance himself, but on this
occasion the dethroned monarch of Annandale
and his consort sate in a glare of calcium all night.
Fate sometimes throws a glare round the person
who feels a deep inward conviction that he looks
half-dressed without an aureole. All the good
old stock-patrons of Sydney graced the dress-
circle, and the other parts of the theatre were
thronged. One damsel in the family circle hung
on to the roof with both hands and applauded
with her feet, I presume.
From a “dressing and accessory” point of view
“ Henry V.” couldn’t be more gorgeously done —
the only thing being awful leanings to minglings
of blue and green in some of the robes, and a
“ carpenter’s scene ” sky of red and green like a
lobster salad. As Henry V., Rignold dresses to
the finger-nails, and when he poses in the first
act with one well-turned red-hosed leg set out
effectively on a velvet cushion (as one sees stock-
ings advertised nowadays) he really looks every
inch the sort of King you read about, but
never see. But to my mind not all the wardrobes
in the world would make Shakesbacon an attrac-
tive stage-dish. One goes to the theatre to enjoy
a souffifi—you don’t want to sit in a corner chewing
corned beef and dumplings—at least I don’t. In
this touch-and-go age, when even the chartered
sapieney of politicians is timed by stop watches,
people don’t attend the play to have their heads
talked off. The hour is ripe for the man to come
along who means to reduce the immortal William’s
long-winded little efforts into a collection of mere
epigrams.
I have received from the publisher, H. J.
Samuell, a copy of Harrison White’s cooing
“Slumber Song,” sung by Miss Colborne Baber
(Mrs. White), and dedicated to her. The song is
well got up, with a very good portrait of Miss
Baber on the title-page, and ought to make a hit
as an encore number, for the music is as pretty as
the words are washy.
I went to revive my favorable impressions of
“ Charley’s Aunt ” at Sydney Criterion, the other
night, and was surprised to observe how the
sophisticated dress-circle girl lets a bright side-
light on to the surface veneer of her innocence
when she shuts her mouth with a click and looks
as solemn as a hanging judge any time the
dialogue is capable of two interpretations. This
shocked and shocking young person should
endeavour to remember, if she wants to impress
the audience with her beautiful mind, that all
double entendres are necessarily two-faced, and
by breaking off a laugh with a snap and looking
down her nose when they occur she emphasises
the indigo side of the jest which she has no
business to know anything about. A wise woman
doesn’t make monkey-faces to show how innocent
she is—she just takes these things easily if she
doesn’t intend to make a break for the door. I
don’t mean, mind you, that “Charley’s Aunt”
wants much watching, only that even the best of
dramatists gang agley now and then. The cast
in the farce is the same. Mrs. Charles Arnold
(pretty Dot Frederic) is still the chirrupy Amy
of the piece, and sweet-voiced Bernard-Beere ish
Miss Knight still pulls her long tan gloves on and
off in the character of Kitty, the beloved of Mr.
Matthews, whose unbridled English accent is the
only blot on the piece.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH
Melbourne Confidences.
Melbourne, September 11.
Mrs. Besant made her Australian dehM before
an audience that ranged from the deep philosopher
in blue spectacles to the cheerful agnostic with a
shilling buttonhole. The women, middle-aged
and not strikingly odd, had evidently come “on
their own ” in many instances, and nearly all the
male ancients present had managed to keep their
white hair on. Your complacent bald-head does
not incline to innovation, except in skirt-dancing.
If of theological tastes, he prefers his dogma cut
and dried, as obtainable, say, at Scots’ Church.
In that esiablishment on Sunday nights the
shimmer of gas-light on hairless scalps becomes at
times quite prismatic.
In appearance, Mrs. Besant is a dignified dame
with waving silvery hair and thoughtful brown
eyes. Her lecturing garb is a flowing gown of
white satin, fichued with biscuit lace. This
costume is described in press reports as a High-
priestess’ robe, but it suggested no ecclesiastical
idea to me. Mahatmas, I believe, discourage,
among other Occidental atrocities, the use of
corsets. An obedient lady theqsophist finds that,
unless she dresses on the loose, she is bound to
reveal a somewhat sausage-like contour. Under
these circumstances her only resource is a tea-
gown, which is precisely what Mrs. Beeant’s so-
called “ vestment” looks to be.
As a speaker, Mrs. Besant comes up to expecta-
tions, which is saying a good deal. If her example
teaches a few local lady haranguers to amend their
ways, Melb. audiences will have reason to bless
her advent. Cranks of the Antoinette order
should note her complete avoidance of falsetto and
hysterics. On the other hand, members of the
self-styled “ Intellectual Sisterhood ” (Salonites,
Browning enthusiasts, &c.) might learn from her
impressive delivery that the familiar conversa-
tional address, with an aside or a giggle at the
end of every sentence, need not be the ne plus
ultra of the female orator.
Since the dissolution of Parliament the wife and
daughter of a very prominent politician have
taken to dropping in, in a friendly way, on the
market-gardeners of pa’s constituency. The other
day they interviewed a Chinese elector, and after
paying a few insidious compliments to his early
peas, gave him their views on the political out-
look, which he also accepted with an encouraging
smile. Upon their departure, an outsider cate-
chising “John” as to his voting intentions,
wrung from him the following ambiguous reply—
“Misse X, welly fat man, Missee X, welly fat
lady, Missee X, welly fat girl, allee familee welly
fat 1 ” Further than this the Mongol declined to
commit himself.
In another suburb, where several candidates
are entering the field for the first time, feeling
runs high among their female relatives. One of
these ladies, a stout matron, whose tresses have a
rare faculty for growing more golden as years roll
on, is employing numberless wiles to help hubby
to the top of the poll. For some time past she has
strenuously opposed the union of her sou, a short
youth in a long hat, with the girl of his choice, a
buxom and really handsome damsel, on the grounds
that the latter is “ not in our set.”
Under pressure of electioneering exigencies,
however, she has abandoned her favorite r6le of
Dame de la haute Noblesse, and now poses as a
plain motherly body ready to discuss whooping-
cough with the butcher’s wife, or confide to the
greengrocer that at one time she could do a day’s
washing with anyone.
Mons. Leon Caron’s brilliant pianoforte
selection from the operetta “Mam’zelleNitouche”
is now ready. It is called “ Nitouohe ” Grand
Galop de Bravoure. It is not difficult to play, but
is very pleasing, and will no doubt be a great
favorite. It was a feature of the operetta
when performed by Williamson and Musgrove’s
Royal Comic Opera Company at the Lyceum
Theatre. “I Was Dreaming,” by Juncker, is
now in its fourth edition. It was sung by Miss
Nellie Stewart in “Ma Mie Rosette ” for six
weeks in Melbourne, and encored every night.
“Slumber Song,” by Harrison White, the second
edition ; the Sydney Moaning Herald describes
it —“Tenderly written, charmingly sung by Miss
Colbourne Baber,” Ready shortly, Leon Caron’s
“Nautch Song,” specially written for and dedi-
cated to and sung by Miss Nellie Stewart. All

Box 1077, G.P.0., Sydney. Two -shillings each.*
Another energetic canvasser of the same district
is a woman who, in her small suburban wav
models herself asjfar as possible after the pattern
of “ the Countess.” When Lady H. declined to
invite those ingrates who had neglected to call at
Govt. House, Mrs. Z. followed suit, by notifying
in the columns of a society journal that only those
members of her acquaintance who should have left
their cards at her mansion by a given date, would
have the entree to the “ at homes” she purposed
holding this season. This was considered hard
upon the aristocrats who, having exhausted their
old stock of pasteboards, were not able to get
credit for another gross at the stationer’s.
Football wanes in favour, but still seems to have
a certain political force. Folks are sneering at the
new leader of the Opposition, on the score of his
alleged “football following,” and in Brisbane
lately a band of picked goal-kickers and “ half-
backs ” kept order at a political meeting. I'he
latter incident recalls old Borne (and also Sydney
at Jubilee time), where unpopular big-wigs seldom
stirred abroad without a body-guard of gladiators
and bravoes.
Female suffrage will not, I fancy, be a burning
question at the approaching election. Times are
scrimpy, and women have quite enough to do-
keeping their gowns and bonnets up to the mark
without troubling about the suffrage. If one!
couldn’t go to the poll looking nice, it were in -
human to want to go at all.
Talking of dress, the place to strike original
ideas in that line is the Block Arcade, where the
Salonites congregate, en route for their temple on-
high. Not long ago, an adipose musical celebrity-
graced one of the evening stances in a garment,
presumably worn as a “theatre jacket.” One-
glance at its demure cut, its white merino purity
and its buttonhole-stitched edges was enough to-
convince any reasonable woman that it hadl
originally been intended for the dressing room..
The garment quite drew tears from one’s eyes,,
with its sweet domestic suggestion of one’s revered!
aunt taking her tea and Bible in bed, the morning;
before she made such a beautiful ending.
The same dame, on another occasion, bravedl
the dangers of the Salon lift in a long boa of
bright-blue feathers and bonnet-strings to match.,
Her companion on that occasion, a local artist,,
crowned a somewhat florid countenance witli a
toque of white grebe skins, while a tippet of the-
same snowy plumage embraced her plump-
shoulders. These little eccentricities are a great-
boon to the Salon. They help to break the mono-
tony of some of the off-nights, and I have half an-
idea that the committee sometimes engage a start-
ling apparition by the hour.
Marie Ulster is the next Victorienne to benefit
“in order to proceed to Europe to complete hen
musical studies.” She has already been there;,
having been educated in Germany, and her voice
is one out of which something should be made..
Her husband, Mr. Larnach, is a Melbourne
barrister, son of the well-known Maorilander;,
the Hun. D. Larnach, of Dunedin, whose castel-
lated residence is one of the sights of the Penin-
sula.
Henry Butler, of Melbourne, got married very
quietly one night last week, the bride being Miss-
Wilson, whose father is one of the Bijou Theatre-
proprietary. Mr. Butler it was who won first
prize in the Queensland Property Distribution,
and he has just spent a good sum of it in taking
over the home which J. T. Wynne vacated in
order to proceed to England. On dit that he
settles many thousands on his young bride.
One of the pet bachelors of Victorian squat-
tocracy will shortly marry a widow, the-
sister of an extremely fascinating well-known
bookmaker. The lady is well-known to the eyes
of the “ first eleven,” none of whom can approach
her in the matter of artistic dress.
“Muffy ” Chirnside, the Werribee heiress, wli»
was married this week to “ Rolf Bold rewood’s”
son, is an admirable specimen of Australian
womanhood. She is a faultless equestrienne and
with her fair-crowned head and Junoesque figure
affords a striking contrast to her bridegroom,
Everard Browne, who is a dark young man of the
lean type.
On dit that a now thoroughly convalescent vice-
regal feature is slightly altered in shape. It has
the appearance of starting later in life than-
formerly, owing, no doubt, to an almost imper-
ceptible depression of the upper part of the.
bridge. The wounded heroine is desperately sen-
sitive on the subject of her scars, and when at-
the show dinner a malapropos remark turned alii
eyes upon her nasal organ, she blushed andl
blushed until her embarrassment infected the-
whole company. Even her usually pale spouse-
looked as if suffering from a sympathetic rush- off
blood to the head.
I was not surprised to hear that choirmasters
who speak with authority on the subject of boys’
singing are not much carried away by Cyril Tyler,
for there is none of the genuine seraphic quality
in Cyril’s notes. The “ boy soprano ” strikes
one’s eye and ear simultaneously as being a girl in
disguise. His attitude is girly and his tricks of
expression, which must have been carefully
studied from the Spadas and Lalla Mirandas of
the concert platform, are just a little nauseating
in a young gentleman of about 15. If his voice
intends to break and go down into his boots, after
the manner of boy-soprano voices, Cyril will
certainly have to put aside bis maidenly wiles and
buy a new expression. As for his singing, it is
thoroughly artistic, in a purely feminine way.
Cyril hasn’t a boy’s style of bringing out the music
that is in him. In florid pieces he sounds like
two-thirds of Lalla Miranda, and his low notes
are echoes of Belle Cole. Were he the young
woman that he was taken for in London, Master
Tyler’s voice wouldn’t be anyway marvellous.
There are hundreds of others like it, but this one
is more or less unique in its sex.

The delay in the progress of the Needle
poisoning case is due to Mrs. Needle’s interesting

In marked contrast to N.S.W. is the atti-
tude of the Victorian Labor party, which has
decided to strongly support all the sitting Labor
members at the coming general election. Also,
discrimination is exercised in the opposition 1
offered to members of the old parties. Under
these circumstances, the democratic element is :
likely to be greatly reinforced at once.

Mr. Rignold celebrated the anniversary of
his occupancy of Sydney Majesty’s by repro-
ducing the great spectacular drama, “ Henry V.,”
by the lamented Baconspere, with which he
opened that theatre seven long years ago. The
occasion was probably one of the greatest in his
life. Almost every notability in N.S. Wales, in-
cluding Gov. Duff, most of the Supreme Court
bench, one Premier and three or four ex-Premiers,
was present, and odd Ministers, ex - Ministers,
and politicians, attended in stacks. The house
was full and wildly enthusiastic, and Mr. Rig-
nold’s reception was the biggest thing that ever
happened to him in Australia. Also it came
pretty near to being the biggest thing that ever
happened to anybody on the Australian stage. As
for “ Henry Y.,” The Bulletin, after much hard
reflection, can conscientiously lay its hand on its
chest and say that it is the largest spectacular
effort which this paper remembers having seen.
There are 20 scenes altogether. All of them are really
good, but half-a-dozen out of the 20 can be safely
get down as superlative, and very much so at that.
The panorama of the battle of Agincourt, in par-
ticular, beginning with a number of live men in
armour at the front, and shading away so artisti-
cally into great masses of painted combatants and
plunging horses and dead bodies and infuriated
troops in mail, at the back, that no one can really
tell where the live army leaves off and the
painted army begins, breaks all records in the
pomp and circumstance of stage carnage. The
average stage-battle, which consists of a few dozen
supers sawing at each other with blunted spears
and other weapons, is bald and unconvincing.
Mr. Rignold’s battle looks absolutely real. The
hoofs and the brains and blood and battered
corpses and all other elements are there, and the
troops are bashing each other’s heads with great
axes in a way that is an absolute guarantee of
good faith on both sides.

The two views of the beleaguered city of
Earfl ■in-, with its vast ramparts and its
gaping breach and the primitive artillery of the
period pounding at its walls, are equally con-
vincing. So is the peaoeful glimpse of South-
ampton and the embarkation of the English
troops; the sunrise on Agincourt; the scene
in the Dauphin’s tent the night before
the battle ; and the triumphal entry of
the returning army into London, where the
stage is crowded with troops and populace and
flags and old-time artillery, and Henry V., on his
white horse, looks every inch a monarch —not the
dull, commonplace reality but the ideal monarch
of fiction and hard lying and unreliable poetry.
The cathedral of Troyes, which is the last scene of
all, is peacefully magnificent, and is a pleasant
rest after three hours of gorgeous carnage. Mr.
Rignold seems to have grown young and beautiful
again, and plays Henry V. with all his old-time
brightness. The rest of the co. is too large to be
OJasidered in detail, but some of the com mend-
able members thereof will be alluded to on some
future occasion. The mechanical arrangements
are as nearly as possible perfect; the army is well-
disciplined, and the curtain always comes down
just as the last of the troops are rushing over the
stage into the deadly breach, so that no one has a
chance to count them and their numbers may be
absolutely indefinite for all the audience knows to
the contrary. “Henry V.” ought to fill the ex-
chequer to overflowing; if it doesn’t there is no
virtue left in military spectacles.

Josfah Higgins’ bull-slufc, one of the
original features of “Morocco Bound,” got under
a Sydney tram-oar the other day, and was reduced
to an unpleasant spectacle of meat and torn hide.
Her loss is deeply deplored, nevertheless the show
getting on tolerably well without her. Some of
the slow and solemn features of the burlesque have
been cut out, and it now goes at a good pace all
through. The music is excellent, the scenery is
up to the mark, the chorus is well-trained, the
costumes are brilliant, and most of the songs are
things to listen to. Wilfred Shine may
y accepted as about the best comedian in
this line—what he is like in other lines of
cosiness The Bulletin has had no opportunity
to ascertain —who was ever deposited
111 this land of drought and sepulchral eucalypti;
end “ Billy ” Elton is a success, as he always is.
further, some of the high kicks which used to
bove off rather prematurely, now don’t leave off
Suite so prematurely as they did; and the dancing

vomeron has been added to the cast, and the
other ladies are nice, though not especially bril-
l la , nt ’ , ar ?H the aristocratic idiot is almost as beauti-
™ly idiotic as was Cecil Ward in the “Amazons.”
toe serious objection that still remains is that
Morocco Bound ” is not strictly a comedy nor
ca opera, nor is it altogether a burlesque—in fact,
R isn’t exactly anything of a definable nature,
except a variety show, and it isn’t exactly that,
cither. And The Bulletin leaves it there, with-
aat feeling quite certain, amid the general un-
acfiuableness, whether it is really there or not.

The “Private Secretary,” that boneless
curate with the goloshes, who got a Bath bun at
‘he British Museum, commences a
season at Sydney Lyceum on Saturday. It is a
oc * many months since this feeble-minded
C'crgyman was last seen in these parts, and the
Wertory ought, therefore, to be something hand-
cpme. There is some talk about a week or two of

German is still in an unsettled condition, and
aothing definite has been heard concerning him.

i he Saturday night audience at Melb.
jNncess’g took kindly to “Lady Windermere’s
urn,' Oscar Wilde’s play happened to I follow
a ibe Cabinet Minister,” and, in comparison with
empty farce, the interest of this unwholesome
u/y appears less hollow than it is. Besides,
m W' n( Lrmere’s Fan ” had so often been
cubed as a mere collection of epigrams that
the fact of its containing a “mother’s sacrifice”
and an interesting elopement was a surprise to
most people. Having found a plot where none
was expected, they didn’t trouble to examine the
nature of their find. Oscar Wilde’s precious Bel-
gravian story springs like a toad-stool from
the rotten suggestion that an adulteress can
only retrieve her past by re-entering so-
ciety. Society is the paradise from which
almighty Grundy casts her forth when she
ran away from her husband. The dream of her
middle-age is to sneak back to Heaven under an
alias. In the meantime she is a lost soul, schem-
ing, year after year, for a card of admission to one
of the balls of the season. She doesn’t wish to
meet and take to her heart the daughter (now
married) whom she deserted in infancy, but she
does hanker after a card from her offspring, that
she may again meet duchesses face to face and
complete the capture of a bald-headed ass. This
is Lady Windermere’s mother, in whose pathetic
case Lord Windermere interests himself deeply.
He spends, on an average, five hours a
day in discussing with the callous adven-
turess the best means of getting her into
the “best houses,” and, since his own house
is one of the best, he goes to his spotless wife
crying, “Send the woman a card, it is her last
chancel ” Spotless Lady Windermere naturally
jumps to the pure conclusion that her husband
wouldn’t beg a card for the mysterious female
unless she were his paramour. Therefore, Lady
Windermere decides to bolt with another lord and
leave her baby, but the unknown parent, getting
wind of this awful resolve, goes after the spotless
fugitive and brings her back to duty. Lady
Windermere’s mother, by so doing, very nearly
loses the hand of her elderly ass. Fortunately,
however, she is able to explain “every darn’d
thing” to that ornament of society, and no doubt
she gets respectably married after the curtain
falls.
• * •
There are ten or a dozen characters in
addition to the abovementioned, and they are all
of them diseased at heart, or destitute of brains,
or both. They live in the world of Oscar Wilde.
The effect of them when they fill the stage is as of
a moral stink oozing through the pores of an eau
de cologne bottle. No matter, “Lady Winder-
mere’s Fan ” is a cleverly-written play, which
would bear even better acting than it gets from
Miss Noble, Mr. Renouf, Mrs. Brough, and a few
of the minor people. The B. and B. company are
a very clever combination, but they don’t shine in
every kind of play they perform, and this is one
of their least glittering artistic efforts. At time
of writing, it is possible that the present bill
will last over Saturday.

Melbourne Royal is under the sway of
Charles Taylor and Ella Carrington, who opened
their new proceedings on Saturday with “Ndver
Despair.” A prologue and four acts are required
for the overthrow of the villain in “ Never
Despair.” The miscreant starts by making
several attempts to kidnap theche-e-ild that stands
between him and the estates, and when the child
grows up to manhood the villain is still intent
upon his capture. His schemes are always
defeated by the same friend in need, a decayed
scholar, who wanders through the prologue and
four acts in search of twopenny worth of gin, and
in whose pocket the missing will lies buried.
Having found the rightful heir in a cellar, this
soddened hero produces his will, and the drama,
one of the worst ever witnessed upon any
stage, dies of literary collapse. On Saturday
the gin-drinking individual makes way for “ Quid
Ireland.”

Melbourne Alexandra closed last Saturday
with a benefit to bright little Dora Mostyn, the
old-time narrative of Jack Sheppard being dug up
for the occasion. At the Oxford (late Gaiety) the
Cogill Bros, are having full houses every night,
and the show, which is considerably strengthened
by the engagement of John Gourlay, seems to be
working along in the right groove. The Alhambra
also keeps fairly up to the mark, and Fillis’s
Circus, although persecuted by the weather, has
decided to hold its ground for another week
or two.

Master Cyril Tyler, who opened at the
Athenaeum, moved into the Town Hall on Satur-
day, but the building proved a rather loose fit for
this small entertainment. Cyril himself is a con-
siderable attraction as a novelty and an artistic
freak of nature, but the company supporting the
mature boy doesn’t count for much. Moreover,
the surprising circumstance about Tyler’s voice is
not so much its sweetness as the amount of hard
training which it represents. He hasn’t the ideal
boy’s voice, and nobody says of him that he sings
“like an angel.” They all agree that he sings
exactly like a woman, which is a rather different
thing.
** * *
Mrs. Besant, after delivering four lectures
at the Bijou, is finishing her course in the
Athenaeum Hall, for the particular benefit of
R. S. Srnythe’s holier friends who object to enter-
ing a theatre. Mrs. Besant should be heard at
her strongest and best, to-night (Thursday), in
“Individual and National Ideals.” As a preacher
of high purpose in life the gifted woman is very
fascinating. For the matter of that, Mrs. Besant
is always a sweet preacher, even when she soars
above the reasoning that all thinking minds can
endorse and gets into the hazy realms of Theoso-
phistic speculation.
** * *
Dear Bulletin, —Listening to Mrs. Annie
Besant on Thursday night, I could not help con-
trasting this thoughtful, educated, silver-voiced
woman with the frog-like Talmage, the dismal
man determined to be funny, the creed-bound
ignoramus prating as a teacher. And yet the
immense chamber in the Town Hall was crowded
choke-full to hear the blattering parson, whereas
the little Bijou had seats for many who stayed
away from the wonderful woman’s lecture on “The
Evolution of Man.” Truly, Mrs. Besant talks
over the heads of the majority of an average audi-
ence when preaching Theosophy ; a lecture from
her on one of her old-time favorite themes would
draw the full of the biggest building in Melbourne.
Her fault as an orator, particularly noticeable in
the first 20 minutes of her lecture, is the Fitz-
Gibbonesque length of her sentences, and a
tendency to parenthesis. Her one visible vanity
is a desire to display the mighty ring of the defunct
Blavatsky, supposed to possess some occult power.
Smythe has brought us the two poles, but one poll
was empty. —Silas Snell.

Cyril Tyler, the boy-singer, had a wonder-
fully successful season in Adelaide; but Bland
Holt has not done big business at the Royal.
At Poverty Point.
Dion Boucicault goes to England shortly, his principal
object being to find a new leading lady of sufficient capa-
city to replace Mrs. Brough, who badly wants a long rest.
Mrs. Brough is probably the most hard-working lady on
the Australian stage, and it is so long since she had a rest
that she must have forgotten what it feels like.
That clever little actress, Mrs. Hayman—one of the
daughters of Mr. J. A. Thynne—-with her husband and a
small company, is going out to storm the back fastnesses
of N.S. Wales.
A benefit is under way for Mrs. Keightley, the heroins
of “ Robbery Under Arms,” and an influential committee
has the matter in hand.
In the Australian Punch and Judy, the Devil gives
place to a Chinaman.
Brough, as the Scot, in the “ Cabinet Minister,”
“ makes up ” for Professor Morris, Higinbotham's son-in-
law and biographer.
Rickards did boom Melb. Alhambra during his visit.
The house on his last appearance compared with that the
following night was like the Flemington Lawn on Cup-day
and the day after.
Curious. Tommy Hudson, of minstrel fame, com-
menced his career as a boy of seven, “the infant pedestal,*’
at a benefit to E. D. Davies, ventriloquist, in England.
This was 45 years ago. Davies is now a broker, with his
office not 50 yards from Hudson’s Bijou Theatre in
Adelaide.
Maggie Moore plays the part of “ Little Jack Sheppard’*
at Melbourne Royal at Cup time. “Rehearsals have
already begun," says a Melbourne paper, but it means
“ training ” probably.
Apropos of Rignold’s revival of “ Henry V.” When last
produced at Her Majesty’s, “ biz ” fell off in the latter
part of the season. Quoth Handsome George on that
occasion : “ If ever I stage this piece again
may 1 be struck dead!” George’s friends and enemies
are now anxiously waiting developments.
A Calcutta newspaper-man writes to The Bulletin :
"Theatrical prospects are dull, with a vigorous adjective.
Twinning, who is well-iiked here, announced Arnold and
Thornton about October, but the fixture has fallen
through. The Potter-Bellew season was only not a failure,
though frigid Kyrle and sinuous Cora N. are held to be
society ‘draws’—society in this wilderness being all
potent. For Australian talent that can find stage-room
and fair receipts this is no place.”
It was in Maoriland, and the play announced was
“ Pygmalion and Galatea.” Said a provincial bank-
manager to a theatrical ditto: “What’s this piece,
4 Pygmalion and Galatea ? ’ I’ve been on the Galatea. I
was at Clontarf when the Duke o’ Edinbro was shot at.
I suppose that conies in?” “Oh, yes; and the Duke
dancing the fling, too.” “Then I’ll come, and bring the
family—they’ve heard me tell about the Duke and the
Galatea 1 was on, often.” He came, and brought the
family. The family had front seats and he had a back
one, being a bank-manager. “ I was never more upset in
my life ! ” he declared afterwards to the manager. “ I’ve
brought my children up to fear only one God, sir, one!
but when I hear your actors and actresses calling on other
gods, commonly, as if they were common stars, and talk-
ing of them as if they were only people in balloons, 1 say
it’s saycrilegious, Mr. Leitch. Just you alter your busi-
ness and never bring them sort of plays here, or it’ll just
be ruination to your body and soul! ”

It is cabled that the melodrama, “ The Fatal Card,” by
Mr. Uaddon Chambers and Mr. B. C. Stephenson, has

Ethel Haydon left for London per Himalaya, accom-
panied by her mother. Mrs. Haydon is an accomplished
and handsome woman, and was at one time on the stage.
Before the boom burst, the Haydons had an ideal home at
which they hospitably entertained the Bohemian world,
Miss Haydon being then known as a promising pianiste.

The simple Minnie Palmer, giving evidence in London
Divorce-court in her suit against husband Merrily Rogers,
said.that in 1890 they separatedin America by agreement.
The agreement was read, and proved to be an amusing
document. She was to receive 1500dols.; “he was so
very liberal,” said Miss Minnie, sweetly. In return for
this 1500dols. (£300), Mr. J. R. Rogers was to have the
flat at Gramercy-park, half her diamonds, and all the
rights in the play “My Sweetheart,” and the others,
with 25 per cent, of her earnings if she played in them.
“You thought that a good bargain?” asked the Judge.
“I thought I was getting rid of him cheaply,” was the
indirect answer.
An American genius has devised a Haunted Swing, in
which the swingers, without being fastened in, enjoy the
supreme felicity of seeming to swing right round their
point of support. That is to say, the swing seems to
whirl completely over, describing a full circle about the
bar on which it hangs, while the occupants shriek con-
vulsively and hug each other. And all the time the swing
never moves ! It is the room in which the swing is fixed
that revolves round the swing !

that, as the veteran had been so good-natured, he
forgave him all, whereat even the Hairy Bis-

The Adelaide Voice has ceased to exist.
The crime-wave is sweeping the land.
People are cutting the throats of their sweetheart!

If the other side refuses to produce the
correspondence between ex-PixMiuer Dibbs and
Gov. Duff re the proposed N.S. \V. Legislative
Council appointments, Dibbs should cut the knot
by handing the letters over to the press himself.
The real reason why the big action of the
Proudfoot firm v. the N.S.W. Railway Commis-
sioners was settled so quietly was that even the
lawyers stood aghast at the manner in which the
costs were being piled up. The claim, originally
for .£750,000, was settled for .£32,000, each side
paying its own costs.
The respectable press is not struck with
the fact that in those shearing outrages when
there is any shooting done it is always the de-
praved unionist who gets laid out. He is the
bloodthirsty individual with the gun, who wants
hot blood, and who is responsible for all the
trouble, but after the battle it is invariably the
unionist who is found full of holes. Probably he
shoots himself in pure spite.
“Were it nob that so many constables
have been drafted out West to watch the shearers,
we could have filled every look-up in Sydney with
drunks on Saturday night last,” said a police-
sergeant in the Water Police Court on Monday.
Thus out of the official mouth comes destructive
criticism of those elaborate tables of arrests for
drunkenness whereby certain statisticians try tc
prove that the drink-habit is advancing or
receding.
N.S.W. Justice Stephen wound up the
Hogan v. Hickey breach of promise case (in which
a lunatic woman was plaintiff) with: “I hope
inquiries will be made as to how this action came
to be brought.” He later on admitted that it was
“brought” regularly enough. But why do noc
their Honors start inquiries as to how half the
libel and slander actions come to be brought?
Such inquiries would often lead to valuable public
information.
One of the latest patents brought to
Sydney is the cheerful combination of a “coach
with a child’s hearse.” This is behind the times.
A Bulletin man has a working-model of a double-
seated, fore-and-aft perambulator, which, when
unhinged, disposes its fore-part into a coffin, its
after-end into a hearse, while the hood cornpiesses
itself into a marble-like tombstone, legeuded, in
brilliant Age doggerel, with all the virtues of the
dead-and-gone paragon.
S.M. Herald, commenting on the piling
up of the Ringaroorna on the New Hebrides,
observes that, save for the Orpheus disaster at
the Manakau, “none of the English war-ships
have come to grief on the Au. ralian station.”
What about the Blanche, that la/ high and dry
on a coral reef, in the Solomons, ior three days ;
the Virago, that made a hole in another reef
somewhere in the South Seas; the Pearl, that
ran ashore at Port Sandwich—only a tew miles
from where the Ringaroorna now lies; and the
Basilisk, that was only saved from running ashore
at night-time, in the Tokelau Group, by the
natives crying out from the shore?
The Kanakas working near Ingham (Q.)
recently held a meeting to protest against the
movement on the part of Northern planters to
induce Government to eject them from their little
leaseholds. Jack Aoba and Buka Buka were to
the fore in the protest, and drew up a petition to
be sent down to the Colonial Secretary. This
movement to evict the free Polynesians is about
the meanest ever made by the Northern Fat Man.
So long as the Islander has his little five or ten
acre patch to retreat to, he won’t accept the star-
vation wages offered by the skinflint planters
around him. Hence the movement for eviction.
Black-labour is slavery. When the nigger won’t
be a slave, the planter tries to run him out of the
country.
Q. Government has had its revenge for the
passage of the payment of members resolutions by
putting five more bigoted reactionaries to block
progress in the Upper House. One of them (Bul-
cock) is an unexceptionable Christian gentleman
with a loud smile. As an underground engineer
of Brisbane politics he has made the phrase of
“ bulcocking an election ” proverbial. Buzacott,
ex-CouBiER editor, is a man with ideas hopelessly
behind the age, and bound hand and foot to MTI-
- Norton, ex-Speaker, has a ponderous
reverence for law-’n-order, and writes absolutely
the dullest leading articles ever penned for the
Courier. Gray (of Quinlan, Gray) represents
money ; and John Ferguson, the Rockhampton
builder, is thrown in as a sop to O.Q. They are all
phenomenally “safe.”
Some years back the Yic. Premier was
invited by the citizens of Maryborough to visit
that once-famed mining centre, the undercurrent
of said hospitality being the desire to secure a fat
Government grant for some local institution.
Maryborough was, at the time, most depressed,
business being almost nil. A general holiday was
proclaimed for the occasion, and all the shops were
closed. “Don’t you think,” said one of the visit-
ing Parliamentary party to the local Mayor, “ that
you’ve made a mistake in shutting all your shops?”
“ Wouldn’t it have impressed the Premier more to
have seen Maryborough in its business clothes ?”
“ Oh, we thought that out,” rejoined the Chief
Magistrate, “ and, in confidence, Mr. Blank, I’ll
tell you the truth. If we hadn’t ordered a general
holiday, the Premier would have seen that every
second (blessed) shop in the city was without a
tenant 1”

Custom is a second nature; it has a mechanical
effect upon the body and a very extraordinary
influence upon the mind. We grow fond of doing
what we are accustomed to, and our employments
become our diversions. Our taste is never better

objectionable to us. Did you enjoy the first glass
of claret or whisky or beer you ever tasted ?
What about your first smoke? Yet habit has
made you an inveterate smoker, and you could not
while away your time without your pipe or your

It is affirmed that a veteran politician
lately resigned from Parliament because otherwise
he would have been made co-respondent in a

A very old resident of Victoria, J. M.

The first thing Gilbert Casey did in Rue
Australia was to agitate Lane out of his billet.
Bnt he tried gentle measures before going to
extremes. Lane and Casey went into a wood and
argued the matter out for eight hours and a-half—
from two o’clock to half-past ten—when Lane was
still unconvinced. Next day Casey worked his
jaw to better purpose, and the Prophet was
deposed.
Tyson, the millionaire, to whose name the
doubtful letters M.L.G. were tacked two years

A good many years ago Richard Seddom
of Maoriland, was a member of a County Councu
in Westland, and the chairman, who didn’t love
Richard, used to rule him out of order almost
every time he tried to say anything. Now Seddon
is Premier, and the former chairman is a mes-
senger attached to the House, and runs on little
errands for his old enemy, and doesn’t rule him
out of order any longer.

A man who had been holding a long and
learned argument with Mrs. Besant on Theosophy,
in Melbourne, finished up by saying to her :
44 Well, as Jesus said, you travel all over the sea

vinced than he was before.” 44 You misquote the
words,” said Mrs. Besant. 44 They are; 4 Ye
compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and

child of hell than yourselves.’ Is that the sense
in which you mean it ? ”

Wet Wragge writes to the Australasian,
protesting against criticisms to which he has been

GEO. TURNER, Leader of the Victorian Opposition.
Australia, “I do not rule the winds and the
weather as did King of ancient fame,”
says Clement, apologising for the failure of his
prophecies. Then the malignant editor says he
“ has only criticised the Brisbane forecasts because
they have been undeservedly over-puffed, and
because the puffery has been wanting in the
modesty which ought to characterise the opera-
tions of a department of science. Mr. Wragge
•may not be responsible for the applause given him
by claqueurs, but the noise they make following
his footsteps is often as troublesome as the per-
formance of a street band, and he seems to like
such music.”
James Smith, the Argus Jeames, has been
a Spiritist for the greater part of his life. Once,
more than 20 years ago, he felt restless in his
study and couldn’t settle down to work. Finally,
he concluded that the spirits were moving him,
and, delivering himself to their influence, he found
himself impelled to visit a poor woman at Rich-
mond, whom he found just on the point of
suiciding on account of money troubles. The
generous James removed her difficulties and
left her in love with life. Nothing will
convince him that the whole thing was not
the work of the spirits. One such expensive mani-
festation in 20 years is quite sufficient to keep his
faith alive. Marcus Clarke, Jardine Smith, and
other brother-journalists could never understand
the level-headed J.S.’s Spiritualistic turn, and put
it down as the small madness of a great mind.
Caldwell, M.P., the emasculation man,
who was chairman of S.A. Pastoral Commission,
has just issued a rhyming description of the trip.
His book is given whatever value it possesses by
some really beautiful photo.-blocks of scenes in
Central Australia. Here is a slab of the reading-
matter :—
“ Still o’er the blasted desert-land
The patient party toiled,
Till o’er a treeless plateau’s rim
Was seen the western wild,
Where dancing mirage glinted,
As if to dare the crew ;
Then sore distressed, some beat their breasts
And knew not what to do.”
There are 70 pages of this sort of thing, for the
poet is as pitiless as “the blasted desert” of which
he sings. Caldwell is the person who legislatively
proposes emasculation as a punishment for certain
offences. One strong argument against such a
punishment is that it would probably bring down
too many men to Caldwellian intellectual level as
revealed in the aforementioned poetry.

have arrested Nana Sahib, the Sepoy Chief of in-
famous disrepute in the Indian mutiny. Aus-

“An Australian missionary has arrived”
at a Central African place with an unpronounce-

Louis Philippe D’Orleans, better known as
Comte de Paris, is dead, and all the Royal houses
of Europe have sent condolences. It seems funny
that Royal houses should condole on the death of
the great-grandson of wicked old Philippe Egalite,
who helped to bring Louis XYI. to execution ;
grandson, too, of that other Louis Philippe, who
intrigued to bring about the Revolution of 1830,
and profited by it. “Royal houses ” indeed !

“Joe” Ivess has planted more

and generally calls it the someth ing-or-
other Mail. His latest is the Eltham
Mail. He was in Parliament once
and got in originally through upsetting
another man’s victory. He was
knocked out through contesting Napier
(after being in his place a month or
two) with squatter Ormond, who won
by a small majority. Then he visited
N.S.W. and planted the Albury Mail,
When pressmen meet him in another
sphere it will be odds on that he
will be about to start the Heavenly
Guardian—or the Hellbourne
Mail.
George Turner, leader of the Victorian
Opposition, started life as a clerk in the office of
Sam Lyons, the Melbourne attorney, rather less
than 30 years ago—he was a law-student at the
University in 1877—and under the eye of that
astute practitioner he has remained to this day.
The clerkling budded into “articles” and bios-
sorned into a partner, or part-partner, with hia
former boss. By the terms of verbal contract
between these faithful allies Lyons retained sole
possession of his police-court practice, but of all
other business George Turner took a half share,
The firm of Lyons and Turner exists without a
partnership deed. Such an instance of mutual
trust between two lawyers is considered a pathetic
an d beautiful thing by the profession at large,
Eor his political notoriety Mr. George Turner is
considerably indebted to friendly and other
societism. He became a Freemason, an Odd-
fellow, and a Forester (we are not prepared
to swear that he isn’t an Ancient Order ol
Druid), and having got well into the inner
workings of those mystic crafts he readied
the dizzy eminence of grand-mastership. George
Turner is also an A.N.A. man, but it was
m his other capacities that he gradually acquired
the habit of making speeches to his fellow
creatures. He was elected for the St. Kilda
Council, and as Mayor of that borough he “ dis-
charged his onerous duties ” with overwhelming
success. The common or garden kind of Mayor
was as naught compared with Turner. So he
came to represent St. Kilda in the Vic. Assembly,
four or foe years ago. Pretty soon he achieved
portfolio of Minister of Customs in the in-
giorious Shiels Cabinet. This with the sanction
Lyons, who stipulated that the Minister’s s.-dary
should be paid into the business of L. and T. to
recompense the firm for the drain upon Turner’s
services by his bleeding country. It is generally
understood that if George Turner gets the
Premiership his legal partner will get half
r at u-i o t i
tbe salary. Meanwhile, Sam Lyons hopes
that Patterson will obtain a large majority, and
give the Opposition leader a chance to return to
his old reliable line of business with a quiet mind.
George Turner is a sound, shrewd solicitor of

s hrewd as yet, nor is any great future predicted
for him by his besb friends . H e wasn’t born to

POLITICAL
POINTS.
M.L.A. —Many Low Associates.
The Land of Promises—Victoria.
Patterson’s retrenchment is preferential
repudiation.
John M’lntyre seems to be the least-des-
pised member of the late Vic. Ministry.
Melbourne Evening Standard supports
the Patterson Government, vide list of share-
holders.
In three sessions running John Davies’ has
been the first condemnatory and discordant voice
raised in N.S.W. Legislative Council.
Dr. Rose, who achieved fame some years
ago in connection with the Weedon divorce-case,
is one of the candidates for North Melbourne.
Out of nearly 200 candidates for the Vic-
torian Assembly less than a score set themselves
down as “ gentlemen.” L. L. Smith was one of
them.
J, E. Mackay, barrister at large, is running
for S. Melb. in the Freetrade and Free-land
cause. He is described as having some logic but
no sense.
Reay, editor of Melbourne Herald, is
trying for Parliament at Dundas. If returned he
will represent Democracy and the Herald so far
as possible.
More than 20 solicitors or barristers, in-
cluding such a land-boom notoriety as Theodore
Fink, are offering their valuable selves for seats in
the Vic. Assembly.
In N.S.W. the expression is “ Whom does
he work for?” In Queensland it is “Who does
he belong to?” But it pretty often means just
about the same thing.
The annual row at Melb. Mutual Store
meeting probably accounts for the unceasing
opposition of R. H. Reid to his fellow-Tory,
Langton, at the Toorak electorate.
The Education Departments in N.S. Wales
and Victoria decline to employ teachers arriving
from the other divisions of Australia. The prin-
ciple involved in this is far-reaching.
Tasmanians have just discovered, to their
great surprise, that they have a 20 per cent, ad
valorem duty on corpses, which come under
“articles not otherwise enumerated.”
Of the 125 members in N.S.W. Legislative
Assembly more than one-half are dependent on
the clerks at the table for the proper shaping of
the questions they desire to place on the notice-
paper.
Miatthew Davies was much riled at not
receiving his “stiffkit ” from Judge Molesworth,
as he intended standing for Toorak, his old elec-
torate, against that tiresome humorist, Punch
MTCinley.
Spagnoletti: “In Melbourne, yesterday
afternoon, at 5.30, a respectable boy of my
acquaintance asked me to give him some break-
fast. Mother had no food in the morning. Here
is the question of the elections.”
Sydney Freetrade newspapers are squeal-
ing because the Australian provinces have to pay
Id. for packets posted to “Freetrade England,”
while they have to receive English packets pre-
paid to the extent of only Nemesis !
The S.M. Herald risks the statement
that the pastoralists’ reports of the shearing-diffi-
culty sent into the office as telegrams and letters
are more trustworthy than are the reports issued
by the “opposite parties.” A pretty challenge.
Almost all the lawyers in Vic. Assembly
went over to Turner in the last days of the old
Parliament. This should be a sign that Turner is
going to win. Where the prospective billets are,
there will “ Gentleman One ” be gathered together.
In most of the Parliaments of Europe, as
well as in the U.S., the hour for starting
work is immediately after lunch, or about 2 p.m.
How do the professional men of those countries
escape the horrors pictured by their fellows in
N.S. Wales?
Queensland possesses a unique politician.
He has represented a constituency close to the
metropolis for seven years, but has made only one
speech in the House, and that of three minutes’
duration. And yet no man dares to contest that
electorate.
“ Boy-Politician ” Caulfield, who now
weighs about 16st., is standing for Kyneton, the
place which produced himself and another notable
politician, who became historic by present-
ing a testimonial to himself when a member of
Assembly.
Premier J. Brown-Patterson’s reception at
Castlemaine should be a lasting warning to Aus-
tralian politicians who grovel for the Imperial
tail-tag. After the meeting had done with J.B.
he looked a living reproduction of the Knight of
the Rueful Countenance.
The party wire-pullers were driven to sore
straits to bring about a Parkes-Dibbs coalition.
It would make people smile to know who had a
four-hour interview with the hairy veteran on the
subject. The Parkes “party,” by the way, has
now dwindled down to two.
Melbournian: “What Patterson wants is
to turn 50,000 people out of Melbourne. He
invites the Melb. tradesmen, family men, after a
lifetime of education to their various crafts, to
‘hump their swags,’ as he says he did, 40 years
ago, when a raw-boned boy. ”
The most frightful shock the Wingen-
Abbott brigade has had for ten years is to find
N.S.W. Premier Reid addressing the president of
the Workers’ Union as “Dear Mr. Williams.”
That was a crime. But it would not be a crime to
address Wingen-Abbott as “ Dear Mr. Abbott.”
Proposed in Bananaland Parliament to
raise salaries of M.’sL. A. from £l5O to £3OO and
at the same time continue the reduction on Civil-
service salaries. Moral—work half the year and
your salary shall be doubled. Work the whole
year and you shall be mulct straightway 10 per
cent.
The Argus is no longer reverent towards
Toryism. In a recent leader it describes, with
evident enjoyment, the French cartoon which
depicted the first conservative, “an aged and dis-
tracted being, who, at the beginning of the world,
rushed to and fro, crying: “O Lord! preserve
chaos.”
Sensible men combining to make them-
selves ridiculous. The Vie. County Court Judges
have issued a round-robin of protest against the
reduction of their salaries. They hint that if a
M.P. comes before them he may possibly receive
scant consideration. This puts them right out of
Court.
Melbournian : “ Graham Berry ought
certainly to get the Speakership. How shame-
fully he was ousted by sky-rocket Munro!
As an Agent-General, Berry was admitted, on all
hands, to be the best on record. He is excellently
qualified for Speaker—by ability, experience and
temper.”
Lawyer Moule, the opponent of Bent
for Brighton (Melb.), is a solemn Church of
England man, and all the sects are said to be
massed in amity under his holy banner. If
prayers to Heaven count for anything in election
fights, Bent will have to fall with his face to the
foe this time.
Barrister Coldham, the henchman of
Purves, Q.C., runs against George Turner for St.
Kilda (Melb.). Turner had some trouble to beat
a local doctor at the ’92 election, bni lie ought to
polish off Coldham easily. A third candidate,
starting in the anti-legal interest, might have got
away from the pair of them.
S.A. Legislative Council recently resolved
that members’ salaries be reduced. This is aimed
more particularly at the Labor members who, un-
like their fellow M.’sP., are expressly prohibited
from pursuing their calling while in Parliament,
and who have more private calls on their £2OO
than the more wealthy members.
The Speakership is already hummed over
in Victoria before the elections. John Gavan
Duffy, with a safe seat, is regarded as a not un-
likely man, and O’Loghlen is ready to do the flying
trapeze from the Attorney-Generalship. Bent is
left round the corner by most of the tipsters. But
Berry would be the best Speaker of them all.
Carter, exploded Vic. Treasurer, patheti-
cally reminds electors that he went about with a
smile on his lips, but with a pain in his heart
engendered by the knowledge that the country
was going to the deuce at the rate of £2500 a day.
The smile was intended to restore confidence, and
was the extent of Carter’s capacity in finance.
Solomon, the South Australian M.L.A.,
has given his solemn promise that he will one
day wipe the floor with Premier Kingston. _ No
date is fixed ; the event may come off at any time,
or it may be postponed till both parties are in a
grey and toothless old age. But some time or
other the floor is to be wiped as aforementioned.
Patterson modestly informed his Castle-
maine friends that he “ had now attained to as
high a position as it is possible for him to reach.”
This, judging of a position by its official name, is
becoming too much of a joke in Victoria. Patter-
son’s position as Premier was utterly contemptible
when he left it. And when he took the billet it
was just as high scs Shiels, Munro, and_ th e
awful Gillies had dragged it down. Besides*
Bent is the first commoner in Victoria.
John Heaysrnan, a Quaker, asked to be
heard at the bar of S. A. Assembly that he might
plead for the life of Brown, the murderer of
Marowski. As a precedent he pointed out that,
200 years ago, the wife of John Bunyan was heard
at the bar of the House of Lords on behalf of her
husband. The Assembly refused, by a vote of 37
to 10.
There are at least half-a-dozen candidates
for the new Vic. Assembly who recall the famous
speech of a certain illiterate, but enormously
wealthy, Yorkshireman (Ounliffe), whose only
address to his constituency was—“ Feller s! Oi
can’t talk a bit, and ye all know it. Brass talks,
lads ! and I fairly stink o’ brass.” He got in,
hands down.
The S.A. Contractors in Parliament Act is
to be so called as to prevent legal members from
getting State pickings. Already every other trade
and profession is provided for under the Legis-
lative disability. There is also a resolution to
prevent any past, present, or future member
getting a State billet till he has been six months
out of the House.
Wanted, the abolition of the exasperating
politician who always begins his speech with “ Mr.
Speaker, I rise ” —— Every one can see that he
rises, so the statement is foolish as well as un-
necessary. Besides, it is the mark of a weak in-
tellect, No real statesman ever got up to tell the
House that he rose.
The women’s political organisations in
Maoriland are, so far, mainly composed of ambi-
tious creatures from the puritan sects, and their
meetings open and end with prayers, by parsons.
It is thus obvious that only a portion of the com-
munity is therein tolerated, and that these mis-
called “public” institutions are mostly run as
parsonical catch-pennies.
Premier Patterson fairly fumed at the
warm reception he got at Oastlemaine. The oppo-
sition of the audience he chose to attribute to the
fact that they were composed of disaffected rail-
way men, and, almost speechless with rage, he
shook his clenched fist at the crowd, and yelled
hoarsely that he would retrench them again and
again. A leader who can’t keep his temper is
doomed.
The cry for Separation in the North has
waxed feeble of late in the halls of Legislature.
The open defection of the leading Fat Man
autonomists, the firebrand of Labor dissensions in
the West, and the want of unanimity on the
question in Parliament are telling against the
Home Rule movement. And yet local Govern-
ment is the backbone of Democracy.
Prophecy re Westralia by John Boyle
O’Reilly, the poet who left Westralia aforesaid in
’69 “ under peculiar circumstances ” in a little
boat without a sail :
Virgin fair thou art
All sweetly’fmitful, wailing with soft pain
The spouse who comes to wake thy sleeping heart.
O Reilly didn’t know that the spouse would wake
the sleeping heart with a pick and shovel.
N.S.W. Minister Young’s minute on sub-
letting and sweating on Govt, contracts is practi-
cally identical with the resolution passed and
afterwards rescinded by Sydney Municipal
Council in re municipal contracts in January last.
The aldermen who carried the motion in the
Council were denounced as “ socialists ” by the
daily press, but now that the Government has set
up the same principles a most discreet silence is
observed.
Dear Bulletin, —Why do people regard
reductions of Judges’ and Governors’ salaries as
sort of sacrilegious ? The railway employe is told
6s. now will buy him as much as 9s. five years
ago, and Parliament cuts him down. But no one
seems to think the same calculation applies to a
Judge. The workman, too, lives close down to
the physiological limit for existence all his life,
whereas the other would merely have to do with
fewer luxuries if docked a trifle. — Kate.
The game of foisting upon the public offices
useless political hangers-on proceeded merrily in
.N.S.W. under the Dibbs regime. The Bulletin
wonders what would happen to the head of a de-
partment who, when it was sought to shove into
his office some wretched Ministerial parasite, sat
down and wrote: “I have no use for another
man—l haven’t work enough for the men I have
got. Anyhow, the present appointee is no good.
He would not be worth 6s. a month in any capa-
city. In fact, I will, if necessary, give him 10s. a
month out of my own pocket to stay away from
here. I am determined not to receive him into
this office.”
The South Australian Co., the absentee
Land Corporation now being much dis-
cussed in S.A., bought, in ’54, over 40,000
acres at 12s. per acre from the Imperial Govt.
The co. still holds nearly all this land, which is
now assessed at about .£1,700,000, excluding im-
provements —in other words, the unearned in-
crement amounts to £1,676,000. Moreover the co.
has been regularly paying a 15 p.c. div.
If established on a common-sense, easily-
understood basis, N.S.W. “Lands” Carruthers'
“ information office ” should abolish that arch*
fraud, the professional land-agent—who, by the
way, is frequently a M.P., with exceptional access
to information, and who always has six or seven
fools at the end of each string, and finally gives
the “ straight-tip ” to the man who dumps down
the biggest fee. Which man is almost always the
squatter, who owns all the land in the coveted
neighbourhood.
Murray Smith, Vic. ex-Agent-General,now
a candidate for snobby Hawthorn, opposes the
One-man-one-vote “principle,” because “those
whose possession of property indicates their civic
virtues should have increased political power.”
As, for instance, the godly Presbyterian elders
who (vide Miss Sutherland) own brothels in Mel-
bourne. It is, however, characteristic of Fat
Men everywhere to believe that you can buy
virtue as you can buy pork or shoddy, and that it
is immoral to be poor.
Mr. H. Parkes, addressing the children of
a school near Sydney, said : “ The Government of
this country, with vast beneficence, has provided
the best primary instruction it is almost possible
to receive.” “The Government ’’—that is, Parkes
and Go. Parliament and the people count for
nothing, except as recipients of the Government’s
(Parkes’) bounty. Will anyone believe, after this,
that the “ beneficence ” only means that the money
of the taxpayers is spent in educating their
children in accordance with their wishes?
N.S.W. Justice-Minister Gould’s proposal
to reduce the number of paid magistrates and turn
the work over to the unpaid is a long step back-
wards. The honorary J.P. system is inexpressibly
corrupt, and from Cape York right down to Cape
Otway it stinks aloud to Heaven for vengeance.
Some police-magistrates, even city police-magis-
trates, are poor creatures enough, but any minister
who proposes to extend the J.P. system is an
enemy of Justioe and of every man with a righteous
cause who goes to law in the obscure corners of
the continent.
“ Jock ” M‘Kenzie, Maori land Minister of
Lands, has a Bill before the Assembly providing
that all newspaper articles and paragraphs shall
be signed with the real name of the author. The
Bulletin has a vague recollection that M‘Kenzie
was the man who threw a pickle-bottle at Fish —
or Fish was the man who threw a pickle-bottle at
M'Kenzie ;it doesn’t really matter which. The
brawny “Jock” has a primitive fashion of re-
taliating on his critics, and he evidently wants to
know their real names in order that he can throw
another bottle at some of them.
The most accurate reporter has his ex-
periences Of public men denying their utterances.
Nor is this, in many cases, dishonesty, though it
is in some. There are politicians who frankly lie,
although clergymen never do. In most cases, the
public man, in the fervor of utterance, actually
knows no more of what he said than some lovers
in pouring out their vows. When the cold type
confronts him he is aghast, as with J. B. Patter-
son’s talk about the broken heads and flaming
houses ; and Berry’s, about the Victorian political
differences being settled like the American Civil
War.
The head of the N.S.W. police is a multi-
tudinous person, He is Inspector-General of Police,
salary, ,£920 ; member of Board of Health, £2 2s.
per sitting, with an average of one sitting a week;
member of Transit Commission, £2 per week, one
sitting a week; member of Aborigines’ Board,
nil; trustee Savings Bank, nil ; quarters valued at
£162 per annum, forage for two horses, one
attendant, and allowance for gas; travellingallow-
ance, 30s. per day. Altogether, he is five men
and two horses, which is being about four men
too many. No man can be more than one man if
he wants to do it well.
It is announced, for anything up to the
six-hundredth time, that the N.S.W. Govern-
ment will give its decision in the matter of the
imprisoned bank directors very shortly. This
frequent announcement is gradually preparing the
public mind for the release of Abigail, Smith and
Co. The news is being broken gradually, as it
were, so that when the whole crowd comes out
some morning hardly anyone will notice the inci-
dent. It is practically the same as hanging a man
by instalments and cutting him down occasionally
in between times, so that his death won’t cume on
the community all at once.

Indigestion
may be the result of a variety of causes, debility
of the digestive tract, over mental work, nervous
prostration, excessive smoking, tea or spirit
drinking. At any rate, no matter what the cause,
the only treatment of any permanent benefit is a
restorative treatment ; the remedy must possess
tonic, invigorating and strengthening properties.
This is not the case with any of the many purging
mixtures sold as dyspepsia panaceas, and this is
proved by their makers stating that the dose must
be increased until the desired effect is attained.
This is due to the nostrum being purely a cathartic,
and by continued use the stomach, liver, and
bowels become educated to the action of the
medicine and it gradually loses all effect. Clements
Tonic is quite distinct in its action, it assists
digestion, promotes the flow of gastric and pan-
creatic fluids, increases the secretion of bile and
thus assist the bowels to throw off the waste
matter; it strengthens the nerves, forms bone,
muscle and nerve tissue, and increases the appe-
tite. Clements Tonic is a natural restorative of a
debilitated system. Read the ease of Mr. George
Joseph Kauter, Greig’s Flat, N.S.W., who writes
on May 3rd, 1893 ; —About three years ago I had
a severe attack of influenza; which left me in an
extremely weak state with entire loss of appetite.
I had taken various medicines without receiving
the slightest benefit, any food I took instead of
doing me good seemed to lie like lead on my
stomach. Seeing that Clements Tonic had done
so much good in influenza cases, I resolved to try
it. I can say honestly that an improvement took
place from the very first dose. I regained my
appetite and strength daily, and by the time I had
finished the second bottle I gained a stone in
weight, I have not had occasion to take any
medicine since, and if ever I do I will fly to
Clements Tonic. —Yours gratefully, Geo. Joseph
Kauter.

A lady wrote to the press the other day
saying that she owned, or knew of the existence
of, a double of one of the (supposedly original) pic-
tures in N.S.W. National Art Gallery. The
Bulletin is tired of this kind of thing, and
refuses to_ regard as a demulcent the statement
that “artists often paint the same picture over
again with slight variations.” People are con-
sidering this matter in connexion with the
esclandre re the Elizabeth Thompson canvas
bought some years ago with good N.S.W. gold,
and the somewhat painful uncertainty as to the
real status of the Detaille recently purchased for a
lot of money.

During the recent big Sydney fire a woman
pushed her way through the crowd and breath-
lessly inquired how many firemen were killed. On
being told she exclaimed, quite disappointed—
“ one ! Why I heard there was seven
killed !” Then turning to her daughter : “ Let’s
get home, Liz. There’s only one killed.” This is
the kind of woman whose offspring usually haven’t
a soul above a hanging. And they even prefer
that to be bungled.

Apropos that lady with the 2000 sovereigns
around her waist. A Melbourne photographer of
the sixties, doing a good, though cheap, business
(and whose wife attended to the customer below
while her husband operated above), wondered
why he never could make financial headway.
One morning, his wife, some years older than him-
self, was found dead in bed. On examining a
private cabinet, the husband discovered over
=£2ooo in gold ! Verily a treasure of a wife !

Loud and bitter is the cry and great
is the lamentation in Israel. The first-
born and highly-sugared son of a big Hebrew
family has recently been sacrificed at the
matrimonial altar to his time-honored Gentile
housekeeper, whose husband had at last made his
long-deferred departure to the bosom of Abraham.
At the conclusion of the ceremony, the parson
who officiated proceeded to hitch the bride’s sister
to the bridegroom’s coachman, and the double
couple are now well into their honeymoon."

“ But surely

“How could I

laughter, and joy.
The second Mrs. Tanqueray in real life is
not always a success. A month or two ago, a
heavily-gilt member of an aristocratic club out
South-West loved her not wisely but so well that he
“ made an honest woman of her.” She was very
pretty, and had revelled in a past full of delicious
naughtiness while a novice in a certain “ con-
vent’’with apolitical history. The wedding was
a very quiet one, and, after a few weeks of honey-
mooning, certain potentates intimated their
intention to visit Aubrey’s country homestead.
Whereat that snobbish person of tin-pot celebrity
coolly left his impossible Paula at their seaside
home and hied him away to bask in the glances
of his lordship. Tired and disgusted, Paula
turned to the Goddess of Oblivion, alcohol, and a
week or two later became a spirit herself. And
now, all that remains of this nine days’ wonder is
the auctioneer’s notice to sell furniture in the
estate of a deceased person.

The executors of old Lachlan M‘Bean,
who died recently, leaving half-a-million behind
him, applied to the court, the other day, for
certain directions as to one or two obscure points
in the will. When the case came on 15 barristers
appeared and asked for an adjournment because
a sixteenth brother was absent. The adjourn-
ment being refused, one of the 15 stated the nature
of the difficulty to the Judge, while the other
looked on, and then the Judge gave his decision,
and the long row of cormorants went out and
collected their fees, and the learned brother who
wasn’t there presumably did likewise. Nobody
can imagine how many birds of prey can find
standing-room on one small bit of paper until he
sees the legal profession gathering round a rich
man’s will.

Justice Chubb’s Townsville (Q.) dictum,
to the effect that unless a decree “nisi ” in divorce
be made absolute the marriage ceremony of the
parties, if they should afterwards contract mar-
riage, will be void and the children be illegitimate,
raises the most important question of the value of
the word “nisi.” This has not been valued in
the direction of Mr. Chubb’s dictum so far in Aus-
tralia in respect of the voiding of marriage,
although, peculiarly, the legitimacy of children
so circumstanced has been questioned in Victoria
and Queensland.

Therefore, when the Chow that has gone before
has lain in his own special corner of the cemetery
until the worms have eaten him, a duly-authorised
Mongol digs him up, and washes the dirt off his
bones, and puts them in a bag to be sent home to
rest in the land of the meek and gentle leper.
Habitual passengers by the train between Rook-
wood and Sydney often meet the official Mongolian
coming back from his sad errand with the deceased
in a sack beneath the seat, and knowing that he
has been all day scrubbing decayed flesh off dead
Asiatic bones they give him as wide a berth as
possible. An impression is also abroad among
the white trash that Cow Fat, the resurrectionist,
ought to walk home with his bag, or else travel in
a vegetable-cart.
The Maoriland Govfc. has the names
1000 girls down for billets in telephone exchanges,

Ward, Maoriland Postmaster-General, says
that within the last few months he has received
applications from GOO of these girls, all wanting
employment in the telephone exchange, and has
“ seen many of the applicants personally.” Con-
sidering that Ward is the most beautiful young
man in the Cabinet, and that the average Maori-
land maiden is as fresh as a spring morning and
as pretty as a hour!, Thb Bulletin is prepared to
bet that Ward saw as many of the applicants
personally as he could manage, and was very sorry
that he didn’t see all of them. The saturnine
Larnach, M.L.A., has now begun to ask beastly
unpleasant questions about Ward’s reasons for
seeing all these girls personally.

A writer in Newcastle (Eng.) Leader :
I hear of a curious project which lias been agitating the
minds of certain young Australians now resident in
London. Young Australia is always rather fully repre-
sented here, chiefly by students of law. It is, of course,
full of youthful enthusiasms. “A hoy’s thoughts.” as
Longfellow says, “are long, long thoughts.” Youthful
Australia is particularly emphatic about its patriotism,
and its loyalty, its regard for the empire and the Crown,
and a wild project was lately set afoot for the purpose of
showing how very loyal the colonists are. A proposal was
made to the Prince of Wales for the formation of a
Colonial bodyguard. It was to he a hundred strong.
Wherever the Prince of Wales went he was to be attended
by a contingent of young colonials. They were not to
wear uniform or to make themselves known in any way.
They were simply to be on the spot to ward off treachery,
and to prevent harm. The matter was laid before the
Prince with many expressions of loyalty and attachment.
He behaved as might have been expected, for the Prince
is before all else a level-headed man with no nonsense about
him. He was grateful, he said, for the feeling shown in
the proposal. He appreciated to the full the loyal senti-
ment out of which such a suggestion sprang. As it
happened, however, he did not want the protection that
was offered to him. The necessity had not arisen. So,
for the present, the Colonial bodyguard plan is to be held
in reserve.

For malicious fibbing commend The Bul-
letin to the unsuccessful lady-journalist who
slates the successful ones in the new magazine,
Cosmos. It is the old quarrel—copy declined,
out with the stiletto! Among other things, it is
apparently asserted, in a veiled attack on
“ Sappho Smith,” that this lady’s pen-name was
originally borrowed from somebody else. Now,
that name was invented in this office ; it has only
been used by the writer who now uses it; and to
the best of The Bulletin’s knowledge and belief
it was never before used anywhere in the wide
world.

Lands Minister Gillen (S.A.) lately visited
the Murray River Village Settlements and re-
turned to Adelaide so enthusiastic over the
industry and prudence of the inhabitants that, on
the first day after his arrival, G. C. Hawker, M.P.,
and squatter Wells gave 1000 sheep between them,
and a generous farmer promised two horses and
enough wheat to sow 100 acres to help the
struggling communists. In this may be seen the
benefit of “looking on the bright side of things,”
for previous travellers who talked pessimistically
of the experiments failed to hit a chord of
generosity anywhere. Nearly 2000 persons are
now drawing their living direct from the soil in
places which last January were given over to the
ti-tree, the wild duck and the rabbit.

In all the Australasian provinces, except
Maoriland, the rite of holy matrimony is on the
decline. This is not to be taken as equivalent to
asserting that “ mating ” is on the decrease ; that
natural propensity continuously maintains its
fashionable popularity. But Church and State
hitchers are alike contumeliously dispensed with.
Why Niggerland should have run down to only
50 per cent, of its former ratio of recognised
marriages; why all the other capitalistic-ruled
provinces of Australia should also show decline in
the number of overture-to-divorce ceremonies;
and why democratic, woman-voting Maoriland
alone should maintain its standard number of
pairs, standing weekly before the altar and halter,
make up a curious problem for the socio-politico-
logical scientist to demonstrate to a satisfactory
solution.
President Baker kept a way from the dinner
given on August 30 by Speaker Coles, and he
brought sufficient influence to bear to prevent the
officers of the S.A. Council from putting in an
appearance. Chief Justice Way was a sight to
behold. Alone of all the guests he donned knee-
breeches, court-sword, cooked hat, and plentiful
frills. The knights had little discs hung round
their necks after the style of registered dogs, and
the Governor donned a broad, bright ribbon, but
Way had got everything on which the regulations
allowed him to wear. It is said that he is now
quite sorry he did not accept a knighthood long
ago, for he can’t well go back on his lofty refusal,
and the P.C.-ship, for which he yearns, is a long
time coming. Lord Kintore won golden opinions
by leaving the “nobs” of the company to chat

CONVERTED SINNERS: AN ELUCI-
DATION.
Last Sunday a Sydney minister was obliged to warn bis
dock that pickpockets bad been among them, and told
them to watch their pockets.—Ex.
Most sweetly broke the Sabbath morn,
And softly tolled the bell,
And pious men flocked forth to hear
The Reverend Blanky Hell,
And listen to the views held by
That spiritual swell.
They flocked with pious looks and fat,
And waistcoats white and round,
With purses stocked with endless coin
From crown to lordly pound,
To drop within his plate, whose name
Had such a Scriptural sound.
But, though that shepherd beat the air
With wild and holy paw,
And foaming lips gave vent to many
A wild and holy saw,
He heard the pleasant chink of coin
, Within his plate no more.
For, solaced by the glowing tale
Of that Great, Glorious Day
When sins before the Judgment Throne
Shall all be wiped away,
Lucifer’s children had crept in
And sraouched his weekly pay.

how are you getting on?” was the greeting of the
first, and his Ex., adapting himself to the exigen-
cies of the occasion, replied: ‘‘Nicely; hows

one of the favored artizans remarked Now,
Kintore’s a fine, handsome, manly chap, if he is a
lord, but it’s an insult to Democracy to let little
Way make such an effigy of himself. It ought to

vote when the succession to Kintore has to be
settled if he doesn’t dress less Imperialistically on

P. S. Solomon, Q. 0., once tried to start a
synagogue at Suva, Fiji. There were many of
the Chosen in the place, but with the exception of
the Salvation Army, the Hebrew religion was
about the only one not definitely fixed locally.
Hardly had the Q.C.’s initial ceremony got
under way, when three lank, dirty coolies stalked
in to take part in the proceedings. The
congregation objected to these additions, but
said strangers proved themselves to be Mahomedan
Jews of superior caste, so they had to be passed.
Owing to the objection to black Hebrews the
service was abandoned.

The just-deceased Maori King, Tawhiao,
arrived in Melbourne a few years ago at a time
when the Mayor happened to be absent. Town-
clerk Fitzgibbon, however, who never loses an
opportunity of gushing over royalties, brown or
white, took the responsibility upon himself and,
without consulting anyone, prepared, at city
expense, a magnificent champagne-turkey-and-
short-pig gorge for the Maori Court.

A few days prior to a very rich Australian
being struck with a fatal malady, the details of
his will leaked out through the usual source.
On news of the testator’s illness (a very fin-
gering one) becoming public, one of those “ m
the know,” possessed of much capital and rapacity,
immediately proceeded 'Ome, interviewed the
peasant who would be entitled to about =£Bo,ooo
on bis brother’s death, and, for a comparatively
trifling amount in cash, got from the assumed sole
beneficiary an assignment of any interest he might
thereafter acquire on the death of his brother, whom
he (the beneficiary) had not heard of for many
years. Everyone will be glad to know that
another will was made two days after that on
which the cute man acted, and that (on the advice
of friends, who had heard of the leak), the whole
of the estate has been left to wife of the
peasant named, with express instructions that her
husband is not to benefit a copper.

Mrs. Wilkie, sentenced to three years imprison-

the hard times, they were told they “might as

farmer on the estate has had his rent raised thrice
in the last five years ; but he can’t shift, for all the
good land in the district is monopolised. Nobody

the free lunch is a paying institution in a busy

is the measure of the average drink. Seven

that the publican who sells no drinks under six-

Mrs. Annie Besant, now in Melbourne,
has come to Australia for the purpose of lecturing
on Theosophy. She is a woman whose name has
become famous through much hard fighting
unpopular causes. There are few names of oppro-
brium in the dictionary which have not been
applied to her at one time or another ; and probably
there are few persons in public life to whom these
terms were more unjustly applied or who have
been influenced less—either in the direction ot
being angered or diverted from a set purpose iy
criticism of the vitriolic order. Originally a Hig
Church woman, she thought herself into Atheism,
through much pain and persecution, and became, a
leader in the English Free-thought party, at the
head of which the late Charles Bradlaugh was a
great and commanding figure. Mrs. Besant has
recently borne tribute to the part Bradlaugh oo
in her intellectual development by his help and
counsel. She says : —•
Through our long comradeship he was my sternest, as
well as "gentlest critic, pointing out to me that in a
party like ours, where our own education and knowledge
were above those whom we led, it was very easy to gain
indiscriminate praise and unstinted admiration ; on the
other hand, we received from Christians equally indis-
criminating abuse and hatred. It was, therefore, need-
ful that we should he sure that we knew thoroughly every
subject that we taught. He saved me from the super-
ficiality that my “ fatal facility” of speech might so easily
have induced ; and when I began to tasle the intoxication
of easily-won applause, his criticism of weak points, his
challenge of weak arguments, his trained judgment, were
of priceless service to me, and what of value there is in
my work is very largely due to his influence, which at
once stimulated and restrained.
Mrs. Besant is a woman of powerful individuality.
In her character, strong will and an unshakeable
devotion to her ideals are curiously blended with
the utmost softness and gentleness. Of medium
height, gracefully formed, with hair now rapidly
turning white, with deep, piercing eyes, which
vary in color according to her mood, she is, even
at the age of 47, a woman from whom a stormy
public life has not taken a winsome charm of
person and manner. Her Irish blood infuses
sometimes clever touches of humor into her lec-
tures, and she possesses that rare gift, the power
of explaining clearly even the most metaphysical
and abstruse of problems. Mrs. Besant does not
try to emphasize her points, after the manner ot
some speakers, by gesticulating wildly or throwing
herself about on the platform; on the contrary,
she stands almost motionless in one spot, moving
her hands slightly now and again, and turning
her head towards the different parts of her audi-
ence. He style is vigorous and forcible., with
careful choice of words and nicely-balanced,
perfect literary sentences. A small slip of paper
suffices to carry all the notes necessary for an
hour’s lecture. After delivering the 50 lectures
in Australia and Maoriland, for which she is
under engagement to R. S. Smythe, Mrs. Besant
goes to India, which in future she intends to look
upon as her home, spending some months of each
year there, and some months in England. Mrs.
Besant’s daughter, Mrs. Besant-Scott, who is
photographed with her, is married to a Melbourne
pressman and is a clever young lady who has
succeeded equally well as a cyclist and as spokes-
woman of an adult-suffrage deputation to the
Victorian Premier.
• # •
Mrs. Besant should deliver one little lec-
ture on apostle Talmage and his pendulum doc-
trine. “The law of the pendulum is the law of
God,” says Talmage. Just now the pendulum
happens to have swung in the direction of financial
depression, and fraud, and other unpleasant cir-
cumstances, but soon it will swing back again to
prosperity, honesty, and joy. After which, of
course, it will have another go at the“cronk’
side of things, and so on for ever and ever. The
law of God, according to friend Talmage, doesn’t
recognise any need for steady improvement in the
conditions of society. His beautiful religion
affords not the least encouragement to the
reformer, and it doesn’t attempt to explain why
Talmage should remain so fixedly prosperous and
good whilst all the other components of society
are swinging to and fro.
Mrs. Besant sees no hope for the future
of society in anti-sweating laws, nor any possi-
bility of making the world at large happier by the
spread of education. With the advanced parson
who dabbles in unspiritual Socialism she has no
real sympathy. The good woman is a pessimist
where she was formerly an optimist. Her dream
of the Brotherhood that may bo is so much more
beautiful than any schemes of the moment that
she would scarcely trouble to put them in practice,
for the little they are worth. Sweating will
endure until the sweating spirit is exorcised from
human nature, says Mrs. Besant. To cultivate
the mind of the oppressed workman is to burden
him with a new misery. The “practical ” parson
is, at the best, only a feeble friend to the poor
when he should be a mighty power to cure the
disease of poverty. Mrs. Besant makes her
clearest and brightest point in charging the church
with having led man to believe that he is naturally
a base animal—with having persistently cursed
his fleshly lusts, and exhorted him to feel sorry
for his disgraceful conduct, instead of teaching
him to glory in his noble impulses. What has the
brimstone shepherd to say to this ?

Although many Dunedin hotels have been
closed by the prohibitionists, the local brewery
output for last quarter has exceeded that of any
previous quarter. This is no conundrum, but an
indeterminate equation with four rational solu-
tions. Wanted, therefore, a return showing—
(l) The number of Dunedinites who now buy
their beer by the barrel direct from the brewery ;
(2) the number of sly-beer shops that have sprung
up since the last annual licensing court; (3) the
gain in beer-pump receipts scooped by the publi-
cans lucky enough to retain their licenses ; (4) the
number of new “clubs.”
Among the music warehouses of Sydney,
those of- Messrs. J. Albert and Son occupy a pro-

are the only music-sellers that sell the 2s.
pieces, waltzes or songs, at Is. 9d., and their
violins, autoharps, cornets, anglos, concertinas,

are beyond any competition whatever. Tis well
to notice that both partners, Mr. J. as well
as Mr. F. Albert, are artistes on most of the
instruments they sell, and understanding
thoroughly the technical construction and tona-
lity of every instrument, enable country cus-
tomers to rely on their knowledge to choose
instruments for them by post. A catalogue con-
taining prices and descriptions of musical instru-
ments, musical toys, music, songs, waltzes, music

The principal features of the Union Bank’s
balance-sheet are that the profit lor the half-year is
£44,181, and a dlv. at the rate of 6 per oent. per annum,
equal to £46,000, has been declared. This is the lowest
dlv. which the Union has paid for about a generation, and
considering that it absorbs a trifle more than the entire
firofits there seems to be no immediate prospeot of an
norease. Last half-year the div. was at the rate of 8 per
cent., and for a good many years it maintained
a steady average of 14, though at times in the remote past
it has stood much higher. Its £25 shares, which have
been quoted as high as £76, are now standing at £29. The
Union has a reserve-fund of £1,000,000, half of it invested
In Government stocks, and considerably over £4,000,000
in ready cash. Its position, therefore, seems very strong,
notwithstanding the serious falling-off in profits.

It is an open secret down South that negotia-

William M’Lean’s (of M’Lean Bros, and Rigg,
Ltd.) approximate schedule (liabilities, £144,000: assets,
£25,000) was filed in Melb, last Saturday, he being the last
of the late Federal Bank crowd to stand out. There is no
doubt that he has made a good and gallant fight; indeed,
long odds were offered 18 months ago on his being
knocked out within a week, and his liabilities at that time
were variously alleged to be anything between half and
three-quarters of a million sterling. He is to be con-
gratulated on the comparatively trifling amount of his
liabilities, considering that in boom-times he had equal
facilities with B. J. Fink, and a much higher reputation
than that famous financier.

Even bankers don’t know everything. A cer-
tain Australian brewery, floated in boom-time into a
limited co., lately went into liquidation. As there was no
capital callable, the bank which had over-advanced
took possession of the building and plant and proceeded
to float the semi-paralysed institution on the London
market. The “ L.M." took it up, with a certain amount
of diffidence, at about 20 per cent. off. Backed by the
successful flotation, the bank proceeds to business and
takes steps to sew up all rivals, when, 10-and-behold, the
liquidator of the old co. steps in and demands from the
bank the neat little sum of £14,000 as the difference
between the price which the bank took certain free-
hold public-houses in at and the price the bank stated
they were worth when the new co. was floated in London!
* • * *
Hopeless overdrafters must not read this, as it
is intended solely for the banking community. As the
; utcome of investigations into the relationship of many
insolvent (but apparently flourishing) Australian mer-
cantile houses with their bankers, it appears that more
than 25 per cent, of said mercantile houses would be out
of existence were the system of discount overdrafts more
strictly supervised, As already here remarked thousands
of pounds worth of insolvent paper is daily discounted
on the strength of the banks’ customers’ endorsement
whereas 25 per cent, of said customers’ apparently
flourishing condition is due to the fact that their bankers
discount any stuff that the firms submit to them.
Indeed, it’s not 12 months ago that one
bank in Melbourne discounted thousands of pounds worth
of bills drawn on and endorsed by absolutely fictitious
individuals. Now, The Bulletin suggests that, as apart
from the superintendents, managers, sub-managers bill-
clerks and the rest of them, the banks which want to get
out of the holes they are in should appoint a really smart
commercial-enquiry man to look over the bills submitted
for discount. Were one or two men it could name put on
the job a bank might do an almost unlimited, but safe,
discount business and make big profits.

China’s position is oramfull of morals to adorn its pigtail.
When China begins to take a serious civilized view of its
own position, many important things will happen. In the
forefront of these things is currency reform, and the first
thing 400 million Chinamen will ask for then will be an
ounce of silver each. The present annual production is,
say, 170,000,0000z5, —but when China holds out its finger-
nails, what price silver ?
* * • •
China’s serious demand for currency is not, per-
naps, so very far off. War is the greatest educator. A
serious, depopulating, ravening war would stir even China
out of conservatism, and then, oh then, ye Brokenhiilion-
aires, your time will come again with healing in its wings.

wool 1 If 400 million Chinamen ask for a flannel shirt—
what price Australian wool? Take heart of grace, ye

gages on station property ! It is not for nothing that the

The defunct Federal Bank showed a great
deficiency in Victoria and N.S. Wales, but in South Aus-
tralia its liabilities were very small, and it had assets
equal to over 40s. in the £. Ever since it broke the S.A.
creditors have been trying to fix up a little scheme
whereby they will get 20s. in the £ out of these local
assets, instead of taking the same proportion as the other
creditors, and the other day an application was made
before Chief Justice Way to that effect. It was promptly
refused. The Federal spirit that is alleged to be growing
up in these provinces doesn’t amount to much when
money is concerned.

The story of the Mercantile Finance Co., of
Melbourne, which has been told already in detached
chapters, is presented in a condensed form in the liqui-
dators’ report. In the first year of its existence it paid
10 per cent, div., and sold 25,000 new shares on the
strength of it; next year it paid 16 per cent., and issued
75,000 new shares at a big premium ; in its fifth half-year
it paid 24 per cent, and professed to carry £70,000 to
reserve; in its sixth half-year it paid a div. of 50 per cent.,
and issued 100,000 new shares at a premium, and increased
its capital from £1,000,000 to £5,000,000; and added
£lOO,OOO to reserve, and then it issued still another big
lot of shares at a still bigger premium. Then it burst up,
and neither the capital nor the reserve nor anything else
except Mr. B. J. Fink’s composition of £d. in the £ has
been found from that day to this.

The Bulletin, in its issue of 25th August,
published a letter from Mr. Crowley, of the City Mutual
Life Assurance Society, and in the course of certain
comments thereon it remarked' that the expenses of the
City Mutual ran to 20 p *r cent, of the premium income.
It has since been asked to explain that 20 per cent, is by
no means an abnormal percentage—considering that the
interest realised on investments is generally higher than
the amount estimated, while the proportion of deaths is
much lower, it is not, apparently, even a dangerous per*
oentage. It makes this explanation with the greatest
pleasure. Among the large assurance offices of Austra-
lasia there is only one—the A.M.P.—the management
expenses of which are less than 20 per cent, of the pre-
mium income, and there are several whose management
expenses are over 20 per cent, of the entire receipts
from premiums, interest on investments, and all other
sources. A time may come, with a higher rate of morta-
lity and a lower rate of interest, when anything over
12 percent, of expenses will be an unsafe expenditure,
but that time seems to be still a long distanoe away.
At the same time, the City Mutual Society has
every reason to be sorry it spoke. When The Bulletin
alluded to that oo.’s expenses as being over 20 per cent,
this paper gave it the benefit of the doubt in every
possible way, and more. As a matter of fact, the sum
put down in its balance-sheet for 1893 as “expenses of
management,* viz,, ±17889 9s. 6d., when compared with
its premium income of £26,001 7s. 10d., shows that the
City Mutual, in that year, spent a trifle over 30 per cent,
of its premiums in management. Further, there is an
item of “special expenses, extension Brisbane branch,
£lOOO, which, we take it, ought to come into the
management expenses, but which is kept separate
for no_ visible reason. Also, there are certain
other items also kept separate, such as “ Agents
balances written off, £550,” “Loss in realisation
of property, £213,” and “ Furniture account, £50,”
that come under the same heading, though not,
perhaps, in the strictest sense of the term, costs
of management. Still, not being investments or
payments to policy-holders, they necessarily come into
the expense account also. Therefore, the City Mutual, in
93, paid more than 36 per cent, of its premiums, or over
29 per cent, of its total income, in management expenses.
Against this the Mutual of Victoria expended 21 per cent,
of its total income in expenses; the Mutual of N.Y., 18# per
cent.; the Equitable, 18| per cent.; the New York Life 24#
per cent. ; the Mutual of Australasia about 22 per cent. ;
the Colonial Mutual about 20 per cent. ; the National
Mutual and Australian Widows’ Fund about 18 per cent.
The A.M.P. is left out of the calculation because it had a
monopoly for so many years, and attained to such vast
proportions before any rival appeared in the field that it
stands on a different footing from its competitors. But
among the comparatively new offices the City Mutual
presents a very serious aspect.
The City Mutual has made a new departure by
affording medical assistance to distressed policy-holders
under extreme circumstances, on the theory that it is
cheaper to spend £2O or so in saving the life of a client
by hospital nursing, than to pay perhaps £5OO to his
widow. The amount expended remains as a charge
against his policy, and is deducted, with interest, when the
policy falls in. The scheme has just one serious dis-
advantage. Ingratitude is the most widespread and
reliable feature in the human character, and the cured
patient, when he finds that he has contracted a heavy
debt to the society, may get rid of the liability by drop-
ping his policy and insuring afresh in some other office,
where he has no “dead horse” to work out. Conse-
quently, the City Mutual may go to considerable expense
to cure a client who would have been cured anyhow, and
then may lose both the money and the client as a conse-
quence. If its customers are not so brutally ungrateful,
however, as this amounts to, the new departure should be

“If the savings-banks be amalgamated,” wept
the sympathetic soft-goodsman M'Millan, in the N.S.W.
National Bank debate, “ the depositors will have to give
up X per cent, of their interest-a loss which will be
severely felt by these poor people.” Excluding those
who deposit in savings-banks merely for security, the
average depositor has only about £lO looked up in these
institutions, and his loss will be therefore about 2s. per
annum, or less than a halfpenny a week—“ which will be
severely felt by these poor people.” A national bank
that will do any national good will more than make up
for that,

The evil effects of the Voluntary Liquidation
Act (Vic.) will not be got rid of for many years to come,
says Col. Templeton. Worse than that, the men who
managed to rush the aforesaid piece of legislation through

they die. What is the use of repealing bad Acts if the
bad actors are to remain ?

The liquidators of the Mercantile Finance Co.
report that the directors had “no justification of their
action " in demanding £7 10s. for a new issue of shares
when the book value of existing shares was only £2 12s.
Surely they had the justification of knowing that they
could do such things with impunity—in Victoria,

Perhaps the brightest gem in the Mercantile
Finance report is the following paragraph:—“ln connec-
tion with the fifth issue of shares an advance was made
to one Atkinson of £71,500. This was really an ad-
vance to Mr. B. J. Fink (although no money was actually
paid over), and as such it was objectionable, hut as it was
carried out under legal advice it is presumed that it was
not illegal."

There is every reason to believe that the B.N.Z.
and the Colonial Bank of Maoriland will shortly amalga-
mate. If they do it will be pretty difficult to fix up
equitable terms for the shareholders. The B.N.Z. has all
the Government business, it has its State guarantee, and
the Estates Co. nightmare, and its shares are now quoted
vaguely at anything or thereabouts-probably 255. would
be a fair estimate. The Colonial, which was born
of poor but honest parents, has a respectable little
business and an unblemished reputation. If it
amalgamates it thereby takes over an interest in the
B.N.Z. Estates Co., which isn’t by any means a desirable
investment. And if it doesn’t amalgamate, both it and
the National have to compete as private institutions
against their State-guaranteed rival, which is a heavy
handicap. Sooner or later the State will have to take
over the whole trio and make them into one big national
institution.

The electric works at Hillgrove (N.S.W.),
drawing their power from the Guyra River, seven miles
away, were successfully tested this week, and the town
will be thoroughly lighted, while 700h.p. are available
for mining. There are evidently “ millions ” in the trans-
mission of electric energy generated by natural water-
power. From the names which appear in connection
with the Hillgrove enterprise, it would appear that the
Colo Valley crowd, ora big section of them, are having a
preliminary canter in New England prior to descending
upon Sydney.
The Colo Valley grab will go through Parlia-
ment unless every democratic member opposes it to the
bitter end—possibly it will go through even then. It is
when a great grab like this is in progress that the want of
the Referendum—as a court of appeal from legislators
who “listen to reason "—is fully realised.

The Londonderry owners are trying to regain
possession of the North and South leases by appeal to
the Supremo Court. Their point is that the regulations
under which these leases were forfeited is ultra vireg
that the Act never contemplated the forfeiture of a lease
before it was granted, and that a distinction is drawn
between a lease and an application for a lease ; that a
contract cannot be cancelled before it is made; in other
words, that lease applications are not forfeitable until
they become leases. If the Supreme Court upholds the
point it would necessitate an indemnifying act dealing
with previous forfeitures. In N.S.W., a lease application
is not forfeitable for nonfulfllment of labor covenants. A
regulation exists making it so in respect to new goldfields
but it has long remained inoperative.

stupendous Fitzgibbon, and the rates levied to pay
interest on this expenditure promise soon to absorb the

Jack Lyons began the S.A. cricket-season by
making 188 at Uraidla on Sep. 8. Jack says he wants to
get in fettle for Peel, who was nearly always too good lor
him in England last season. G. Giffen had also better
practise up for Richardson.
Geo. Giffen has left his old club, the Norwoods,
and this season plays for Adelaide. Giffen did not play
for Norwood on his return from England last year because
Blinman was elected captain in his absence, and although
the latter offered to give way, Giffen remained obdurate.
But most cricketers thought he would go back Nor-
wood this year, considering that he owes everything to the
club and particularly to its patron, E. T. Smith.
An old-time commissioner and a certain horse-
owner, both of them wily customers, are said to have

One of the most comical freaks of the cable liar
was perpetrated by the "faker” of Melb. Evening
card a few days since. A message came stating that
Stoddart’s team of English cricketers is weak in batters.
The "faker” misread “batters,” thinking it to be the
name of a man, and made the cable read thus:—
" The London Echo is of opinion that Mr. Stoddart will
greatly feel the absence of Batters before the tour is con-
eluded.’* , ,
“ Batters was well up on the list of averages last season
in all-round cricket, and would, no doubt, have been very
useful had he been selected.** . , ~
The latter paragraph was, of course, pure lane.
Delicious! _ ,

The boycott of knickerbockered cyclistes by
English hotels and restaurants has given birth to the
" lady cyclists’ federation,” an institution which proposes
to encourage the sport, firstly by advancing cash to
aspiring girls wherewith to purchase machines, ana
secondly by dotting every road in England with branch
club houses, where they can put up in peace without the
interference of any long-lipped Puritans or female Gorgons
with flat chests and musoleless limbs.

By the burning-out of caterer Baumann,
Sydney has at least temporarily lost one of the
very few places where one could get anything
really good to eat. However, the big Lawler fire
does not deprive Sydneyites of the chance of
having something good to roost on, as that well-
known firm of bedding-manufacturers announce
that, pending re-arrangement of premises, they
have temporarily removed to 6 Union Lane, on
George-street, Sydney.
Eccentric Kaiser Wilhelm has not broken
aut in a fresh place -it is the same old place with
a fresh breach in it. This lovely potentate is on
the most affable terms with the Almighty, and
“Me and God” is his modern substitute tor
Cardinal Wolsey’s “ Ego et rex mens ’—with the
difference that God, unlike Henry the Eighth,
can’t hit back. His recent tirade against the
nobility, concluding with the words, Onward
with God against the parties of revolution, and
dishonour be his who forsakes me!” could astonish
people who know only of the physical ailments
from which he constantly suffers, and are not
aware that these ailments are fought and over-
thrown by the regular use of that world-famed
remedy, Marshall’s Tonic Nervine.
Eight-hour Bay this year falls on Oct. 1,
and Mr. T. W. Furse is kept busy, day and night,
at his office, Dixon-street, Sydney, arranging the
details of the big carnival. It is a tremendous
task for one brain and one set of hands, but Mr.
Furse does not shirk difficulties, and as the days
pass on, the effect of his efforts is apparent in the
good order in which he has arranged all matters
possible up to date. There is one thing he wishes
to impress upon the public, and that is—that to
participate in the art-union drawing, it is not
■necessary to attend the fete at Rosehill. Every
'ticket bought, whether used or not, has its dupli-
cate placed in the barrel at the drawing, and any
single eighteen-penn’orth may land the big nrst
jprize, value .£4OO.

No notice will be taken of communications insuffi-
ciently stamped. Name and address must
appear on MS. No liability is undertaken re
contributions voluntarily submitted , and in no
case will MS. be returned unless stamps are
sent.
Niv. : No, we never noticed it. And even if
Sir Algernon Chohnondeley does break his neck trying to
jump over something it doesn’t trouble us The Wan-
derer: Your ghoulful yarn will be published.... Grass:
To " pluralise her bloke” is the very latest definition of
“immorality.” ...Matron (Launceston): Your grievance
is 100 general and not sufficiently particular Tall Boy
(Mitchell); Can’t blast your auctioneer just now, mean
man competition having been shut down upon by a
bl nited Government ..Artist: The drunken major who
saw four horses instead of one is very W'eak. We have a
man in this office now and then who is often accompanied
all the way home by 14 dogs, wolves, camels, and other
animals.. .Mutti (Narellan); The fight is gory enough,
but the style is too feeble. The biggest shindy in creation
would sound like a mild unpleasantness at a prayer-
meeting the way you tell it.... F. W.B. : Can’t tell
whether the shearer’s joke or the squatter’s is the feebler.
They are both so weak that they need to lean up against
each other ...J.T. (Little Plain): Two columns of very
serious dialogue. Reminds us of the conversations in the
good little boy’s book between the well - informed
resident, in the tall hat, and “ Charles, his friend.”
Beeswing: The Bulletin put in a few plain lines what
you say in 38 foggy pages. Pars. 3, p. 31 ; 2,3, p. 32 ;
amply justify comment you object to. And surely you
are not going to pose as originator of the State Land
Bank idea ? ... A.E.H.: Dull, and amateurish.... J.S.G.:
Corduroy verse. Since reading it we have suffered from
spinal concussion... H.G.P.; Poetry isn’t built that way.
....Oliver Myles: We won’t rob you of the “reserved
rights.” It is a somewhat curious thing that The Bulle-
tin (which, by the way, never claims the copyright of
anybody’s work) has never yet found a new contributor
whose work was worth a rap say anything in advance
about copyright. The man who lias his eye on his copy-
right from the very “jump ” alw'ays has a badly-swollen
head ...Barbed Wire: Useless .. H.H. : Declined...
Jerry; Tired of it S.P. : Trite Education: Q.
Grammar-schools are a costly excrescence, and as there is
no Govt, inspection they give poor value for the money
spent on them. The Bulletin believes free, compulsory
education should stop with the primary schools, though
State secondary schools and a State university, working
as parts of a graded and harmonious system, should
be established and free to merit Herbert J. : That
yarn happens every day X.Y.Z. ; Next week.
Louis P.: The legend of Count Robert of Paris lacks Aus-
tralian iuteres:, and the poetry isn’t good enough to
crowd through without Australian interest Coal: A
fine specimen of gall-or imposition A.C. (Armidale):
A small boy making obscene remarks to a drunken woman
may be your idea of humor; it isn’t ours... Dinkum
Dave: A feebly-eloquent production. It is no use to call
on the workman to “let the light of Reason brightly
shine.” You might as well give a book on elocution to a
starving man .. Propeller: “The Gnief Mate” is below
Plimsoli-mark . Wombat: A weak poem on a weak par-
I m W.H. (Bourke)’: Picturesque murder. May publish.
... Mark MacDermott : You say “ If Protection against
the world is good for Australia as a whole it is good for
each colony, town and person against each other," and if
it isn’t good for each individual to be protected against
every other then it isn’t good for the country to be pro-
tected against other countries. And, on the same lovely
system of logic, if it is necessary for the country to have a
a Parliament and a code of laws, police force, military
and naval establishment, State bank, court of justice,
coinage, water and sewerage system, and so on, then
every individual should have his own Parliament, and his
own array, navy, police force. State bank, Supreme Court,
coinage, and all the rest. And if it isn’t good that he
should have them, then they should be abolished alto-
gether. Did it ever strike you to abolish all handicaps in
horse-racing, and Igt every horse in at the same weight?
That is Freetrade The system of weights, which tries to
put the slow horse on the same level as the fast one, is
the same as Protection, which tries to give the workman
at 8 hours a day and Is. an hour a chance against the one
at U hours a day and 10s. a week... .Dita : Older than
llamlet s soliloquy... Tommy H.: He may have deterior-
ated as a story-teller, but is still a matchless liar Village
Blacksmith: Well, and what’s the moral? That bare-
footed hoys are more self-reliant ?.... Old Hiram: No
hypnosis, so far as we know,... Rupex: A stock story,
told of Tyson, M'Bean, Rand, and all the rest.. .R.J.D.:
Yes, excellent. Please send the exact address of the
Speewa. .. Warrawee: Why the “Savage” club? Why
not something original and un-English ? Why not the
Damper-and-Mutton club? ..Langers: The Q. labor-men
have been driven on by the Worker, which is running on
solidarity lines with the motto of “Socialism in our
time.’ i They did not expect that Powers would throw up
his billet so unceremoniously, and they are apparently
far from happy in the situation they have brought
i j The old story. They didn’t know it was
loaded....Rewi: “English ” is quite right. The Scotch
vote here for their own countrymen, and so do the Irish,
but the Englishman, being in the majority, cannot reckon
°. r ?,, . e vo *' e compatriots. Melbourne has been, and
still is, ruled by Scotch cant Zimri: Jam nauseous.
A man can live on salt-horse and damper, but who
could exist on marmalade?... .H.R. : Not suitable....
Banana - Fritter : Why don’t you try yourself?
Dclmer F.: All true and solid, but you can’t say it in
a paper of general circulation A. : The unbelieving
people rises against its masters in unbelief and says—
“ Give me my share here below, seeing you take from me
my share in heaven,” and all the Talmages and M‘Neills
cannot silence it... Moko: We have seen it, but O Rell’s
remarks on the characteristics of the Australian bush are
naught but a weak dilution of Marcus Clarke’s preface to
Gordons poems... Constant Subscriber: Such a title is
not good as against the Crown, which can shift you off its
land even if you have been there 50 years Cyn: The
Bulletin doesn’t want to be in any club or reading-room.
Its proprietors want each copy read by one person only
and then burnt. Nobody can hurt our feelings. We
haven’t any feelings now Wallaby: The answer did
not apply to you and referred to a personal, not a political,
matter... Bay Ash: Will consider.... W.S. : Treatment
not good enough,... Bell: Can’t say quite when it will
take place—it’s not getting along very fast Campsie
(B.) ; When you can stop a man from doing as he pleases
in his house you will be able to control his actions in his
club, which is equally his home.... Waldo; Unless you have
some money to stand by you, better stay where you are.
Whenever a man is wanted in those regions it is one who
can use hammer and drill and put in a set of timber, not
one who has been a clerk ail his life. If you will go
raining, try and slide into it by degrees—tackle it in
N.S.W. first and see how you get along T.E.H. : Dull
and lengthy....F.M.: Thanks; verse hardly pith enough-
one par. use.... Ruhtra : Not “ O.K. off K.. G.H.M. :
Same opinion still... Dusty Bobb : True; but it has all
been said already .. A.H.D.: We’re not to be H.A.D.
Pop ; 510 p.... Kauri : A mixture of “ Wait till the clouds
rolls by” and “Good time coming.” ...W.J.H.: Whisky
yarn is old Irish Brownie: Declined Hester;
Thought fair; verse slipshod... .A M‘K. : Most people
can’t think, even in prose; very few can think in verse...
G.H.W. : Accursed is he who rolls his MS.. F.W.J. :
Cranbrook, Syrs., Bst. 121 b., won Newmarket Handicap
in 1888 in Imin. lljsec., making a record Louie:
Thanks for report of the remarks of your terrible infant,
but all the amusing blasphemy required by The Bulletin
can be got from the clergy, as solemnly reported in the
“ religious ” papers.
iS.b.W. elector : “Are you in favor of
postage on newspapers ?” Candidate: “I am in
favor of ha’penny penny postage.
“ Thunderbolt,” by Rev. J. M. Macdonald
(Hurst and Blackett), is made up of dreary drop-
pings from a diary of 30 years ago, garnished with
mild pulpit humour, and dished-up without a
word to show how far the grotesque mixture is
from the Australia of to-day or any other day.
Poor Thunderbolt, one of the most romantic
figures in our history, is attached like a lady’s
poodle to a chain of dull dialogue, and shorn of all
his sinister splendour. It is melancholy to see
good type and paper wasted on such a book, while
half-a-dozen clever Australian authors are pining
for publication.

the skill he possesses as an herbalist, and the bond
iides of his testimonials appear to be well estab-
lished.”—S. A. Register, Adelaide.
“ Herr Rassmussen’s labours have resulted in a
manner most gratifying to himself, inasmuch as
he has received the highest recognition of the most
important scientific authority in the world —viz.,
the Academie Parisienne des Inventeurs, France,
who have not only elected him as honorary corres-
ponding member, but also awarded him their (jold
medal and diploma of honor.” —Flashes (Society
Paper), Brisbane, Q.

Danish herbalist and botanist, has for the last 10
years carried on a very extensive herbal medicine

vouch for the great cures effected by Herr Rass-

A GREAT LITERARY TRINITY.
YATES, SALA, AND SIMS.
We have much pleasure in presenting our
readers with portraits of three great English
literary celebrities, Edmund Yates, George Au-
gustus Sala, and George R. Sims. Yates, who died
the other day so sadly, but so appropriately, at a
fashionable London hotel, just after the close of a
fashionable London “first night” at one of the
theatres, was a most interesting man. A brilliant
writer, an eloquent speaker, and a ready wit,
he acquired renown from having introduced the
lively paragraphic fashion of journalism, which
made the future of his vivacious World, and has
nO'V been generally adopted by the most readable
newspapers. As a leading London litterateur
truly observed, “Edward Yates, the versatile
novelist, .able journalist, and popular man about
town, exerted a potent influence on the social and
political developments of the age whereof he was
a remarkable and characteristic product.” Sala
is known to Australians—he visited the colonies a
few years ago. As special correspondent of the
London Daily Telegraph he has travelled in
strange lands and seen strange sights ; and he still
contributes to that journal, many of its brightest
articles being from his facile pen. G. R. Sims,
journalist and dramatist, belongs to a younger
generation of literary lions, and is familiar to us
as one of the founders of the London Referee,
and as the author of the “ Dagonet Ballads,” and
of numerous very successful plays, such as
‘ Lights o’ London ” and “Romany Rye.” The
wonderful Waterbury Watches are as popular
among literary men as they are among the other
sections of the community. Yates, Sala, and
Sims, all within a few months of each other’ took
to wearing Waterburys. The first-mentioned
gentleman, in a letter referring to the loss of a
costly English lever, said : “I have supplied my
loss with a Waterbury, and have purchased three
others within the last 12 months.” Sala, writing
to a friend, remarked : “ You should have taken
to a Waterbury long ago. I wore my own at
first, compulsorily; but ere long I learned to love
it —it keeps such excellent time.” And Sims
wrote: “I now wear a Waterbury instead of
Grandfather’s Clock,’ as the valuable heirloom I
have hitherto personally conducted over the
world is familiarly called.” There can be no doubt
that the Waterbury watch is the favorite watch
among all classes, and the secret of its extra-
ordinary success lies in its accuracy, durableness,
and inexpensiveness.

Wool and Produce Reports.
M'Bcrnby, Wallis & 00. report:—At wool auction
sales this week, the market for scoured was even with
last fortnightly series. Greasy assumed a slightly weaker
tone. Producers need take no alarm at this, as it may be
accounted for by the fact that sales open at Antwerp on
11th, and London on the 18th inst., and buyers are
naturally not over-anxious in their bidding, pending
results of above sales. We anticipated this “stand off ”
attitude on the part of purchasers, and accordingly re-
framed from offering wool this week, preferring to
hold over until we have received news of London
sales, and know the true position of our market. In
a week or two all the foreign buyers will be with us,
and we will then be in a position to conscientiously offer
the wool entrusted to our care, and give our constituents
the benefit of fullest competition. Although a cable from
London does not now act as a barometer on Sydney sales,
as in the old days of speculation, in this instance the
London opening may be taken as an index to Sydney
auctions regarding the benefit to be derived from the
abolition of the United States import duty. Our opinion
is that after the opening of the London series the Sydney
market will show a slight improvement and then remain
firm. Sydney, Sept. 7,1894.
Tub Nbw Zealand Loan and Mercantile Co., Ltd.,
report: Some good-sized catalogues of the new clip were
submitted for sale in this market on sth and 6th inst.,
but owing to the fact that the selection offered was a very
inferior one, most of the wools being heavily charged
with earth and waste, prices in most instances failed to
reach owners’ reserves. Good wools elicited capital com-
petition at up to figures slightly in excess of those
current last season. For instance, we sold the BURWICK
PARK fleece, from Hay, at 7d. per lb., as against 6| realised
for the fleece of the same mark in Melbourne last season,
and for the MYALL PARK over RYO, from the Darling
Downs, we secured 7Jd. per lb., the price paid for this
brand s year ago being only 6|d. The former of these
two clips was well-grown, but crammed with clover-burr,
while the latter, although a good, useful, soundly-grown
wool, had been packed with nearly all the skirt left on
the fleeces. Our latest advices from London are highly
encouraging, and we fully anticipate that at the forth-
coming September sales in that centre prices will show a
substantial improvement on last sale’s closing prices. A
good rise is required to bring prices for some of the back
country wools up to anything like a remunerative level,
for at the last London sales a good many of these were
quilted at from 4Jd. to per lb., even after the home
market had improved 5 per cent.
The “hon.” sec. to Brisbane Hospital Ball
has been voted 20 guineas by the committee for
his services. Whereat a howl of indignation has
gone up—for the donation (with Govt, endow-
ment) means a loss of 60 guineas to the Hospital
funds.

At times, when all the earth is bright) l ,
And all the world seems new,
Emboldened by the God-sent light,
I think what I might do.
E’en ms I think, my soul grows great
And glows to my glad view ;
My heart grows big with things to be,
The tilings that I shall do.
At times, when all the earth is dark,
And cloud-hid sleeps the sun,
I think, in days all chill and stark.
Oil things I might have done.
My heart dries up, my soul sinks dead,
And haven see I none,
As there I stand amazed before
The things I should have done.
God, when the sand of Time has run,
And stars wane thin and blue,
When to Thy judgment-seat I’ve won,
And meed to me is due,
Wilt Thou forgive, for what I’ve done,
The things I did not do ?

«Do politics pay 1” is the latest debating-
club subject down South. Agreed: politics pay —
politicians don’t.
The Fijian for beef is bulimakau, and it is
derived from the English words bull and cow.
The first cattle landed in Fiji caused great con-
sternation amongst the natives. “What are
those?” said one to a sailor. “That’s a bull,”
replied the sailor. “What did you call it,” said
another native. “That’s a cow,” said another
sailor. Thus the words bull and cow became
bulimakau.
Rev. J. Fordyce, of Sydney, claims that
Christianity has regenerated society, among other
things, “by its new ideal of the home, its new
reverence for women.” Which just about indi-
cates the value of the clerical intelligence—or the
clerical capacity for misrepresenting facts. What
does Mr. Fordyce think of the position of woman,
according to Tacitus, in pagan Germany, where
she was the equal, comrade, and adviser of her
husband, as compared with her position in
Christian Germany to-day—his slave and beast of
burden? He is apparently ignorant that Chris-
tianity, as he knows it, was finally developed by
the Greeks and Germans. The reverence for
woman, of which the adoration of the Virgin
Mary is only a part, was a German development.
There is no hint of it in the Bible, where the
woman is strictly kept in subjection to the man.
Renan truly says that “if Christianity had
remained what it was for the early Judseo-
Ohristian it would have conquered the East, and
there would have been no Islam. But it would
have had no influence in Europe.”

shelves, but still the gold-seeker was not satisfied.
“I want one of those there Wesleyan hammers,”
he said testily ; “ doesn’t thee know what a Wes-
leyan hammer is?” “No,” was the sharp reply,
“ what is it?” To which the buyer : “Why, one
of these here two-faced beggars.”
Dear Bulletin, —lie “J. S. Deeming’s ”
woman who was rnatutinally footed out of bed by
hubby, I knew an “ Amurkan cit’zen ” who
attributed his lumbar rheumatism to his wife’s
custom of warming her tootsies in the small of his
back. Asked why he didn’t rebel, he said, “It
pays, mister ! She’s got a little pile of her own,
and I charge her 25 cents a minute for the luxury.
It’s a bad night that don’t pan out 2.50 I”—A.M.
Dear Bulletin, —The philosophy of the
“ infidel ” stigma is as simple as a believer in
Talmage. Mankind consists of, A—bamboozlers;
B—barnboozlables ; o—imbamboozlables. O is a
self-contained entity; A and B are mere comple-
ments of each other; since, therefore, the prospec-
tive assimilation of B and C means annihilation of
A, it is simply the self-preservative instinct that
drives A to that “ abuse of the other side,” which
is the invariable concomitant of “no case!”—
Hbbetio.
A Sydney paper says that Mrs. Grundy
isn’t known in Samoa —because the white ladies
bathe together au naturel and ride straddle-legged
like natives. This is incorrect. In Apian society
Mrs, Grundy has a staggering load to carry ; and
although the white ladies do bathe occasionally
mid noddings on, they don’t ride straddle-legs.
And, talking about bathing in Samoa, there is, a
short distance from Apia, perhaps the finest bath-
ing-place in the world—at a place called “ The
Papasea.” On the margin of a deep pool there is
a huge, sloping rock as slippery as glass, and the
bathers sit on the top with legs close together but
stiffened out in front. Then they let go and
slither down like a streak of greased lightning.
A young and pretty woman—either white or
native—looks very graceful as she vanishes down
the rock and plops into the water with a loud
“chip!” but when it is a stout, heavy female with
a 72in. waist and limbs terraced with fat, the sight
brings loud yells of derision from the native on-
lookers.

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
“Last Spring, I was grievously afflicted
with biliousness and liver complaint. My
mouth was in a terrible condition every
morning, my tongue thickly coated, my
breath was offensive, and my bowels were
always out of order; nor did the many rem-
edies recommended do me any.good, until I
tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, when my improve-
ment began almost from the first dose.
This unlooked-for, but grateful, result, was
accomplished by only two and a half bottles
of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.” •

HOW TO TURN BACK THE CLOCK.
The divorced in the U,S. Humber OHO to
every 185 married persons.
“ What time is it, Maggie?” said John, with an
uneasy sense that he ought to be on his homeward
way.
“ I’ll go and look,” she answered. Stepping
quietly into the kitchen the girl pushed the clock
hands back an hour, and returning, said, “ It’s
only half-past nine by our clock ; you can stay an
hour longer.”
So John stayed, for lovers are never eager to
part, and he needed no coaxing. The next morning,
however, he overslept himself, and Maggie’s
father, at his breakfast, having missed the train
he intended to journey by that day, wondered how
the good old clock could have lost an hour in the
night. But Maggie didn’t explain. She meant
to set it right again before going to bed, but forgot,
which shows once more what everybody should
remember —that we can set back the clock, but we
cannot set back the time.
All the same it is possible occasionally to regain
lost things. In a woman’s letter recently received,
I find this sentence ; “ They tell me I look ten years
younger than I did.” And if she felt as she
looked, she was, to all practical purposes, ten years
younger. For, although a clock face looks the
same, no matter what time it is, a human face
doesn’t. That changes with the condition of the
“works,” or the life behind it.
The letter goes on thus ; “ In the spring of 1880
I felt weak and low. I had a bad taste in the
mouth, and a thick, slimy phlegm covered my
mouth and tongue. I was sick in a morning,
retching and vomiting a watery fluid. I had
great pain in the head and was very mazy, being
at times so bad I could hardly stand upon my
feet. After eating the simplest food I had dread-
ful pain in my chest, and a tightness across the
chest and sides. For hours together I have sab
before the fire rubbing my chest to try and get
relief. I had great pain in the left side and pal-
pitation of the heart, and could get but little sleep
at night on account of it,
“Gradually I grew weaker and weaker until
I could scarcely walk about the house, and bub
for the necessity of attending to my family, I
should have been laid up. My life was a burden
and a misery to me, and I often wished myself
dead.
“ Sometimes better, and at other times worse ;
this was my general condition for ten years., during
which long period of suffering I was treated by the
doctor, and took every kind of medicine I could
hear tell of, but got no better.
“In November, 1890, I read in a book of a
medicine called Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup,
and got a bottle from Mr. E. Banks, the chemist.
After I had taken a few doses I found my food
agreed with me better. I kept on with the Syrup
and gradually gained strength. I had become
so thin and emaciated through all those years of
suffering that it took time to fully restore me.
But I am now in better health than I ever was in
my life, and my recovery has astonished my
friends. They tell me I look ten years younger
than I did before taking the Syrup. How I wish I
had known of it years sooner ! My husband and
friends had given up all hope of my getting
better, but none of us knew of Mother Seigel’s
Syrup.
“On mentioning to the Rev. E. Harries, the
Vicar of Christ Church, what had wrought the
cure, he said I should write and let the proprietors
know what the Syrup had done for me, so as to
benefit others. You may publish this statement
as you think proper, and I will gladly answer
enquiries. Yours truly, (signed) (Mrs.) Elizabeth
Greenhalgh, 21, Rutland Street, Newtown, Pendle-
bury (near Manchester), May 14th, 1892.”
Thus was this good woman enabled—not to
turn back her nominal age, but what was better—
to recover the priceless treasure of health, without
which neither youth nor age has any comfort.
Her malady was the same wretched indigestion
and dyspepsia, the curse of all ages and nations.
A Ten-Word Tragedy.
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
Miss Tottie de Vandeleer,
A chorus lady smart,
Hoped on from year to year
To win a “ speaking part. 1 *
She played a sultana once—
A vision in spangled net;
But the rapture divine of reciting a lial
She never had tasted yet.
Now the manager’s name was Binks,
A gay young creature this ;
With sundry smirks and winks
He stole a virgin kiss
From each of the chorus-maids,
And tickled their chins, perhaps—
Save Tottie alone, who was colder than stone,
And didn’t believe in chaps.
So the manager swore and vowed;
He also wept in vain—
Miss Tottie, calm and proud,
Refused him in disdain.
Bub, ah ! on the stage one day
He noticed her blush and start.
When Lottie de Grey, in a mischievous way,
Said, “Wouldn’t you like a part !”
Pert Lottie had words to speak—
Six words, no more or less.
Poor Tottie’s tell-tale cheek
The truth did e’en confess.
Quoth manager Binks —“ My bride
Yon orphan shall be at last; ”
And he eyed her askance till he spotted a chance
Of putting her in the oast.
Binks waited a weary while
For one production new.
He smiled a meaning smile—
“ Miss Vandeleer, walk through.”
He led her aside and cried —
“ There’s so-and-so’s part to fill:
Say, will you be mine if I give you a line ?”
Dear Tottie replied, “ I will.”
“Just name the day, my joy !’’
Exclaimed the beaming swain.
She called him “Foolish boy ’’ —
He squeezed her hand again,
And ere he would let it go
She whispered in Binks’s car—
“l’ll become Mrs. B. when the papers agree
In praising Miss Vandeleer."
So the manager walked on air
Whilst Tottie learned her part,
She took exceeding care
To get it quite by heart.
She studied the livelong day—■
Ten words, no less or more.
The manager, struck on his own little duck,
Had put in an extra four.
But, great was the mental strain.
Tot’s health began to fail ;
She racked her throbbing brain
Till both her cheeks grew pale.
She dreaded the critics’ scorn
As the fateful night drew near,
Though manager Binks (who had given ’em
drinks)
Said, “That' 11 be right, my dear.”
The appointed time had come,
’Twas Tottie’s turn to speak !
One minute she was dumb,
The next an awful shriek
Rang out in the crowded house !
A babel of countless tongues,
Like a ton-weight of lead little Tottie fell dead
(Burst blood-vessel on the lungs).
Soon the manager smoothed his brow,
And sang, with smile serene—
“ She lives with mother now,
My bride that might have been.”
His bosom he left exposed
To Cupid’s amorous darts,
And Lottie de Grey is appearing, they say,
In all of the ten-word parts.
E.F.
“Let him marry the girl.” The magis-
terial gag again at North Melbourne Court the
other day, over a baby, even by Dr. Lloyd, the
ordinarily sensible Amateur Pro. Beak. But the
Lothario had declared he “loved another!"
Nathless worthy Lloyd, with the mathematical
square-off of the regular formula, exclaimed
’ “ Pooh !, pooh ! Let the young people come to-
gether, and make it up.’’ And they were happy
ever after.
Dear Bulletin, —Count Strzlecki’s hypo-
thesis that after intercourse with a white man an
aboriginal woman is sterile toward her own race
is to be found on p. 346 of his “ Physical Descrip-
tion of New South Wales and Van Diemen’s
Land.” It is quite false, having not only no
physiological basis, but being also cqntrary to
fact. One bushman probably noted that one par-
ticular, gin, after relation with a white, became
sterile toward her rightful spouse, and on that one
case founded, by the logical fallacy of post hoc
ergo propter hoc, a sweeping generalisation which
passed from mouth to mouth among the unob-
servant. Facts tell their own tale, and here are a
few graphically set down, the children being born
in the order named. Firstly, in Brough Smyth’s
“Aborigines of Victoria,” vol. 1., pp. 93-94, Rev.
Mr. Hartmann, of Lake Hindmarsh, vouches for
“Kitty ” (two half-caste children, one black), and
“Charlotte’’(one half-caste, one black); Mr. John
Green, of Coranderrk, for “Borat” (one half-
caste, three black), and “ Eliza ” (one half-caste,
four black); Rev. Mr. Hagenauer, of Lake Wel-
lington, for “Lucy” (two half-caste, six black),
“Mary” (two black, one half-caste, one black),
and “Charlotte” (three black, one half-caste,
three black, one half-caste, one black). That last
case alone is a clincher. Also, Rev. Geqrge
Taplin, writing of the S.A. tribe, “ Narrinyeri,”
in Curr’s “Australian Race’’ (vol. 11., p. 263),
says he has known many women who have had a
half-caste as first child, and several blacks after,
as well as cases where a half-caste followed several
blacks, and was itself followed in turn by blacks.

Bill’s Resolve.
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
The papers came to hand to-day, about a fortnight
late ;
I picked the newsy items out and read them to my
mate;
He’s not an educated chap—his name, of course, is
Bill,
And he and I are after gold on Koorawatha hill.
I read about a hungry man who perished in the
snow —
The Yankee parson-mountebank, who’s traveilin’
round on show,
A nice divorce, a poisoning-oase, an anarchistic
plot,
And how the row between the Chow and Jap. was
waxing hot;
A swindle by a holy man, a murder case or two,
And how the Queensland Parliament had raised
the members’ screw;
Then it was time to go to work, but Bill was out
of sorts
And sat aside pre-oocupied upon a heap of quartz.
I saw him view his welted hands in disapproving
mood, x
When he thought 1 wasn’t looking he would strike
an attitude;
I felt a little bit afraid that he was going mad,
Not much inclined to disagree with one who had
’em bad;
He muttered something now and then, but what I
could not hear
Until I caught the magic words, “ Three hundred
pounds a year.”
Then, like a man who’d been relieved of some
depressing weight,
He said, “Old man, I’m going to leave —you get
another mate;
I’ve got a notion in my head, I think it’s bound to
pay,
And if it should I’ll try and put a trifle in your
way.
I’ve been a grafter all my days, and what have I
to boast ?
I’ve mined and fenced and earned a crust, you
know as well as most;
I’m known upon the Darling Downs and on the
far Barooo;
I’ve made a living on the Towers and on the
Etheridge, too,
And now I’m sick of bursting quartz from Koora-
wal lia Hill.
You think you’ll make a fortune here—l’m sure I
hope you will.
But I am set on higher things, I know a dodge or
two,
And I’m going to be a member since the members
raised their screw.”

“ Whab is becoming pretty plain, however,
to most people is that the law, in addition to being
‘ahass,’ is getting to be a most rapacious rogue,
and it is a question worthy of consideration
whether the lawyers should not be shut out of
Parliament when the subject of legal reform is to
be considered. . . . Evidently the electors of this
province ought to think of some other things than
the personnel of ministries and official of
taxation. Why should they not call in question
the practical right of a privileged profession to
levy tribute upon them?” (Echoes of Bulletin
sentiments, from Melb. Age of August 24th).
Certain frauds connected with the payment
of military pensions in Sydney have put the

And one—well, o’er her a man fondly lingers and
feels that she’s a woman and he’s a man.
Dear Bulletin, Stand Evangelist
M‘Neill’s idea on its head and you’ll be nearer
the truth. For one “ regenerate ” who’s ashamed
to label himself “saved,” there are thousands of
unbelievers who dare not .for daily bread’s sake,
give orthodoxy the chance to jump on them in the
name of God.’ The man who thinks for himself is
less of a social leper than he was, but never still
does he touch any loaf or fish that the smug
mechanical pietist can keep out of his reach.
Talmage may possibly make the angels weep—
M‘Neill makes ’em laugh till their feathers fall
out!— Pagan.
The person named Bongers who writes to
the papers in fulsome praise of Talmage has an
unlucky name. Among some South African tribes
“bongering” is a profession. The “bongerer”
makes his living by taking his stand outside the
door of some great man, and discoursing at the
top of his voice about his sagacity, his gigantic
strength, the beauty of his wife, his great wealth
and his valor, until the object of his commendation
gives him sixpence to go away. By-and-bye
Talmage may perhaps offer Bongers sixpence to
go away. This is where the final resemblance will
come in.
During the Chicago riots Gen. Robbins,
of the State militia, issued a general order pro-
hibiting any of his troops from reading the
Chicago Times. Whereupon the Times retaliated
through its correspondence columns :
Libertyville, lowa, July 14.—T0 the Editor: Will you
please say through the columns of the Times) whether or
not Gen. Robbins of Indiana is a relative of 001. Dink
Dock of Posey, Ind. ?— M. Howard. [Gen. Robbins and
Col. Dink Dock are fourth cousins. The original ancestor
of both was the justly celebrated Dickery, Dickery Dock,
famed in song and story as having seen a mouse run up
a clock, causing the clock to strike one. Col. Dink Dock,
as the writer truthfully observes, resides in Posey, while
Gen. Robbins is a resident of the Pink Mink marshes.
Col. Dink Dock is a lawyer by profession, while Gen.
Robbins runs a cranberry ranch, and originated the
experiment of crossing Indiana mosquitoes with lightning
bugs to enable the former to work at night.]
The famous whisky-distilling firm of John
Walker and Sons, Limited, have issued a beauti-
fully-bound illustrated pamphlet, describing their

work is Mr. Alfred Barnard, writer of “ The
Whisky Distilleries of the United Kingdom,”
and, apart from the mere advertisement, the
brochure tells an interesting narrative of the rise
and progress of a great business concern, and of
distilleries which "are not only themselves his-
torical, but which have been immortalised by
Robert Burns.
A Stormy Passage.
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
Preamble.
It is known to those who have ever made a voyage
to Europe by a P. and O. or an Orient liner, that
a clergyman of the Established Church of Eng-
land is an indispensable adjunct to all long
voyages. He reads service on the quarter-deck
at six bells every seventh day, from beneath the
canopy of the British flag, and preaches a sermon
bristling with local allusions about “ people who
go down to the sea in ships,” &e. In the absence
of a parson of the Established Church, the captain
reads the service; but the absence of a parson
seems to be a very rare occurrence, as gentlemen
of the cloth appear to be travelling to and fro
continually—for their health—at reduced passage-
rates. They meddle with everyone’s business,
find fault with the cooking, hold Bible-classes at
untimely hours, worry the captain, the crew, and
the passengers, and bury the dead when there are
any. They also interfere with flirtations, as will
be seen from the following narrative.
L
Mrs. Clements came aboard the liner at Largs
Bay, Port Adelaide, leaving her distressed hus-
band waving a wet handkerchief from the tender,
A sweet face had Mrs. 0., and a lovely
set of white teeth (like most Adelaidies), a
petite figure, and an appetite that made her the
envy of our table, where she sat. Sea-sickness
troubled her not, and she soon pervaded the ship,
the incarnation of humor, good nature, and mis-
chief.
After calling at Albany, and rounding the
stormy Leuwin, the liner plunged heavily into the
Indian Ocean, under a tropic sun, which raged
down from above, blistering the paint and making
the tar ooze from the crevices of the deck planking,
However objectionable the days were on board
a crowded ship, where the deck-chairs and their
sea-sick occupants made walking impossible, the
tropic nights made ample amends for the tropic
days. The liner rolled along porpoise-fashion
through the blue-green expanse of sea, leaving a
long track of phosphorescent light behind her.
We were not long in striking up an acquaint-
ance with Mrs. Cl ments, who became more and
more soul-satisfying in white muslin and a sailor’s
hat. Gradually the passengers recovered from
their sickness, and emerged from their cabins one
by one, and then commenced those sudden bosom
friendships which are so common on board ship at
the first stages of the voyage, and generally turn
into bitter hatreds before the journey’s end,
Mrs. 0. kept aloof from the course of friend-
ship-making. She had other occupations. With-
out doubt she was a desperate flirt, and liked
moonlight walks on the hurricane-decks, with
something in the shape of a man to lean against
when the ship lurched.
11.
Brown, of Sydney, a lanky Australian native
on his first trip to Europe, was pacing the narrow
space of the hurricane-deck, smoking a long pipe,
when eight bells struck (noon). With a glance
over the side to the blue fields and “lawns,” he
turned and made for the companion-way leading
to the bar.
“ Time "for a whisky squash ?” he said to one of
the engineers, who was making violent love to a
pale creature in pink, reclining in a deck chair.
“It always is,” remarked the engineer, desert*
ing the fair one, and following Brown to the bar,
“What’s that row the parson’s kicking up
about a lady passenger being on deck last night
after “lights out?’’ said the engineer, sucking his
squash through a straw.
“Oh, he’s at it still?” replied Brown. “lie
seems to boss the ship now he’s got over his sea-
sickness. He’ll want to take command and stop
to fish for chariot-wheels in the Red Sea. The
fact is we were having a chat last night on deck-
beautiful moonlight night, bright as day—myself
and—and Mrs. Clements, when up came the parson
and asked did we know that the lights were out,
and that all ‘ladies’ (he italicised the word) ought
to be below. With that Mrs. Clements stood up
and boxed his reverend ears, and told him that if
he couldn’t be a gentleman he ought at least to
remember that he was a clergyman.”
“Yes, we always have rows with parsons on
board,” replied the engineer.
“ This morning the religious society clique sent
that young cub Birch to say that Mrs. Jenkins,
the parson’s wife, Mrs. Dr. Yates, and several
other ladies, presented their compliments to all
and sundry, and admonished them that anyone
seen speaking to Mrs. Clements would be ostra-
cised socially for the rest of the voyage.”
“ Well, what did you do? ”
“We sent back our compliments, and said that
as we had paid our fares we should speak to whom
we liked, and as far as their threats were con-
cerned, they could go to Sokotra, which was the
nearest land we knew of, also that we all thought
Mrs. Clements the most charming woman on the
ship.”
111.
This was the beginning of the slight rift that
subsequently grew to an unbridgeable chasm.
“ The worst of it is,” said Dr. Yates, in conversa-
tion with the purser, “ Mrs. C. is the only pianiste
on the ship.”
The doctor was a good fellow, and a first-rate
amateur violinist, but Mrs. Yates having joined the
Public Morals Committee that circumstance cut
him off from the solacing assistance of Mrs. 0.,
and threw him back on the execrable accompani-
ments of his wife.
“It is annoying,” replied the purser, “especially
for Mrs. Timmins’ husband, who plays the flute
obligato for Mrs. Clements’ songs. It’s all he can
play, too, and now he’s not allowed to speak to
her.”
“Then there’s the parson’s wife, who sings
hymns really well, but plays dreadfully,” said the
doctor. “ I suppose we’ll be at her mercy now.”
IV.
The married ladies, to a woman, ranged them-
selves with the parson. The single men, the
widows, and the doubtfuls supported Mrs. C.
Amongst the husbands there was a sneaking sym-
pathy for the latter, rigidly suppressed. The
single girls went with their mothers, who went
with the parson’s faction. Those who had no
mothers on board went on the side the single
men were on— viz., Mrs. C.’s.
Meanwhile, that little sneak, Birch, a first-trip
man (who had parted from pious parents, and was
destined for the church, but had a leaning towards
comic songs and bad company) wavered between
the two camps, and carried yarns to both.
The first brush between the parson and the
enemy came the day after at Colombo. Some-
thing in the “spicy bree/.es” which, it is alleged.
“ blow soft on Ceylon’s [isle,” aroused the parson’s

religious ardor, and led to the establishment of
Bible classes every morning, at four bells, in the
saloon. While the class was listening to the
pastor’s eloquence, the piano on deck immedi-
ately above would strike up “Tararaboomdeay ”
a tune which, on its disastrous way to Australia,
was permanently seized and taken on board our
ship. Then the parson made grave complaints to
the captain of the stoppage of religious exercises,
while the other party would protest against the
psalm singing, which interfered with legitimate
music, and was totally inconsistent with whist.
Meanwhile, the ship plunged and lurched and
throbbed and dashed the cool waters from her
sides, driving through the tropical haze by day,
and the fields of moonlight and phosphorescent
sea by night. And Mrs. Clements plunged into
waves of phosphorescent flirtation, and emerged
again as cool and as water-tight as her nautical
sister ; neither of them ever getting beyond their
depth.
Y.
The news came from Birch, of course. Brown,
meeting the little chap outside the bath-room one
red-hot morning in the Red Hot Sea, saw that
Birch was bursting with news.
So in the course of a few minutes’ conversation,
the murder came out. Parson Jenkins had
organised a concert, ignoring Mrs. C.’s services
and the services of her faction.
A hasty council of war was called, which sat (in
pyjamas) in the smoke-room before breakfast,
when it was unanimously agreed that as all the
musical talent was on their side—barring Dr.
Yates and the melancholy flautist—the con-
cert was doomed to failure and should be treated
as a huge joke.
VI.
Who can describe that concert ? First came the
parson, who made some opening remarks, with
several cutting allusions to the opposition, and
references to the “respectable portion of the pas-
sengers ” who were supposed to be there present.
Then Dr. Yates floundered through a long
violin solo, to the haphazard accompaniment of
his wife. Young Birch was announced for a
comic song he had heard Rickards sing, at the
first portion of which the representatives of
respectability screamed with laughter; until it
came to a part where it related a story of a man
who had a slight misfortune with his lower gar-
ments. At this the opposition laughed uproariously,
the others scowled with horror, and drove the
wavering Birch permanently into opposition.
Then the parson recited something humorous in
solemn tones, like a sermon; and the flautist played
a melancholy solo, unaccompanied by aught save
the creaking of the ship’s planks in remote and
discordant keys, and then fled to the bar, whence
he re-emerged no more that evening.
Six thousand centuries at least looked down
from the Arabian shore at the remainder of the
programme, and joined with the opposition
faction in derision and disdain.
VII.
When the lights went out on deck that night
Brown paced up and down for an hour with a pipe,
listening to the monotonous swish of the waves,
and thinking over the events of the night. Then
he descended the companion ladder to the main
deck, and passed along towards his cabin on the
starboard side.
As he crossed one of the passages he heard
voices coming from a cabin which he knew to be
that of Mrs. Clements.
That lady having descended an hour ago, and
having few female friends on board, he wondered
what could keep her from those sweet slumbers
from which she rose, even in the tropics, with the
complexion of a peach.
He was a man, and, of course, listened.
The voices were feminine. One sounded tearful
and appealing ; the other hard and defiant.
“Came up to me,” went on the latter voice,
“ before a whole deckful of people, with whom I
was sitting, on a broad moonlight night, and said
it was time all ladies were below. So now, that’s
the reason.”
“But, Jessie,” said the tearful voice, “it was
late, you know, and ”
“Well, if it was ! I’m my own mistress, and I
don’t care for all the parsons in the world. I
never flirted till then ; but now I’ll flirt, and flirt,
and flirt, till there isn’t a man on board, from the
captain down, that I won’t have flirted with;
there, now !”
“ Well, Jennie, I must do my duty. It’s not
my fault. But if anyone knew who you were.
What would they think?”
“ Well, they won’t know who I am. Did I say
who I was when your cad of a husband insulted
me? Now, good-night, and when you meet me on
deck, please ignore me. Stick to your own set,
the doctor’s wife and the other cats, and leave me
to manage my own business, which I’m quite
capable of doing. Good-night.”
“ Good-night.”
Brown was just sneaking round to his own cabin
when the lady emerged from the other cabin and
confronted him.
“ Great Scott! ”he said, “ the parson’s wife.”
VIII.
It was the night of the Great Revenge. A
week had elapsed since the parson’s concert, and
during that time Mrs. Clements had been carrying
out the most audacious flirtation with everyone
under pretence of organising the rival concert
given by the opposition.
Since the concert fiasco the parson’s power had
steadily declined. Several waverers came bodily
over to the opposition, and daily defections from
the parsonic ranks gave testimony to the variable-
ness of public opinion whether floating or
stationary—and to the persuasiveness of Mrs, O.
Even a very pointed sermon against “ Evil doers
and evil doing ” on Sunday by the parson brought
him no recruits.
On this night, the proceedings were to include
a concert, a ball and supper. For the concert the
whole of the available unmarried talent had been
enlisted by Mrs. 0. The captain—who was, of
course, married, but whose wife was ashore —was
down for two songs. A good, rough, old salt he
was, and he loved his ship and many other trim-
built things of the same sex.
For the supper the cook, won over completely
by the charming passenger, had done his very
best, and had beaten the record with an iced
jelly. The ship’s bandsmen, her sworn allies, had
polished their instruments for the occasion.
She was übiquitous, up and down the ship and,
as she went, she whispered to everyone in a mys-
terious undertone —
“ I’ve got a surprise for to-night]! ”
“Ah, indeed! What is it?”
“ A new singer, a real gem. Such a surprise !’*
And away she danced.
All the elements were propitious, fine weather,
a smooth sea, a nice breeze through the open
ports. The band played an overture, the captain
sang something about Poll somebody or other,
who was attached to sailors in general and the
singer in particular. Birch did the comic busi-
ness, but—by special request —-did not repeat his
former success. Mrs. C. sang a delicious thing to
her own accompaniment, about long years ago
and a dark-eyed girl in Spain. Then Brown sang,
in a deep baritone, of a knight who did something
on a plain and was afterwards killed.
In fact, everything sparkled, and the ship
seemed to swish along more jauntily than ever on
her course towards Brindisi, by the beautiful
islands of Cephalonia and Zante.
The last batch of waverers had gone over to the
enemy that evening, and the vanquished Public
Morals Clique wandered disconsolately round the
outskirts of the audience—all but the doctor and
the flautist, who, feeling that they were weak,
erring men, and liable to fall, and that the eyes of
their wives were on them, confined their atten-
tion to the barman during the concert.
Meanwhile, the concert went on with unflagging
zeal. Some Australian lunatic trotted out “How
we beat the Favourite,” and rode the “tan
muzzle ” “still past the gateway ” to victory.
Still Mrs. C.’s surprise had not turned up, and
anxious looks were cast when she at length rose
from the piano and left the saloon. The conver-
sation buzzed and buzzed and diminuendoed into
silence as she re-entered radiant, erect, beaming,
with a glory of triumph in her face, in her hand a
bundle of fresh music, and behind her, in full
dress —
The Parson’s Wife!
IX.
And how she sang, that parsoness! First a
florid Italian solo with variations, then a vocal
duet with Mrs. Clements, then a pianoforte duet.
Her deep contralto seemed made by the Great
Architect or Musician of the Universe to chord
and harmonise with Mrs. O.’s soprano, and after
one more solo she left the saloon amidst deafening
applause, and a feeling of wonder that such a
glorious voice should have been so sinfully per-
verted during the previous part of the voyage by
the singing of monotonous and uninspiring hymns.
After the concert, the ball went swimmingly.
The couples floundered around the rolling deck as
they do on liners always, and enjoyed the flounder-
ing. Mrs. 0. danced with everyone, from the
captain downwards as far as she could get.
Finally, three of the unfortunate husbands got
drunk and violent, and were captured by their
wives and put to bed with difficulty, after many
attempts to get on deck to dance.
In short, the parson was vanquished, Mrs.
Clements had triumphed, the Great Revenge was
complete, and the town of Brindisi was in sight
X.
About a fortnight later Brown descended the
companion-ladder at Tilbury Docks, with a port-
manteau in each hand, and gazed round for a long
time as if looking for a face amongst the pas-
sengers.
Just then a hand touched his arm, a demure
face looked up at him, and the sweet voice of Mrs.
Clements said :
“ Good-bye, Mr. Brown, and thank you for all
your kindness to me.”
“One word,” he said, as he shook hands.
“Mrs. Jenkins, the parson’s wife. You knew
her!”
“ Yes, a little !”
“Had you ever met her before you came
board ?” on
“Well, yes,” said Mrs. C. slyly, “once or twice
years ago. You see, she’s my sister. Good-bye ’’’
Carey, the American economist who set
out to smash Protection, and ended by becoming
its ablest champion: “All the Protection that
agriculture needs any where is that of having the
market brought to its door, and thus enabling it
to maintain the powers of the land while freeing
itself from the one great tax of transportation
compared with which all other taxes sink into
insignificance.”
An affecting scene occurred in Ballarat City
Council Chamber the other day. Mayor Thomn-
son called upon Councillors Elliott and Shopped
who have for long glowered savagely at each other
across the table, to shake bands. Councillor
Alexander Bell, with fine dramatic instinct, seized
the opportunity to recite a passage from Burns to
the effect that one should gently scan his brither
man, and Messrs. Elliott and Shoppee immediately
fell upon each others’ necks and swore eternal
friendship. The touching incident concluded with
refreshments.
An English paper has been giving prizes
for accounts of the most extraordinary circum-
stances under which husbands have met their
future wives. The first prize met her when he
was three years old, and she a baby. They were
inmates of a public institution, at which there was
a fire. A nurse put the little girl in the little
boy’s bed, and said “Take care of her.” The
second prize met his future wife for the first time
while running to catch a train. Her hat blew off,
and he ran after it. This caused him to miss the
train; it happened to be that fatal one which
broke down the Tay Bridge, and was lost, with
all hands.
An old Melbourne shopkeeper—a Hebrew
dealer in second-hand clothes—was convicted of
insane indecency the other day, and fined .£25,
There are probably twenty other men in prison at
the present time for committing the same offence
in a rather milder form. They were vile wretches,
and horrible creatures, and pests to society, and
the Law generally sentenced them to a flogging
as well as a dose of solitary confinement. The
shopkeeper who could cash up his .£25 on the spot
was an unfortunate monomaniac. The Law re-
cognises or ignores a fact just according to cir-
cumstances, even as a highly respectable citizen
discriminates between the people he wants to
forget and those he is anxious to become chummy
with. Let us say it again—No suit of broadcloth
ever was or ever will be taken off beside a set of
British or Australian triangles. Flogging is a
class punishment. It is for the man in workman’s
garb, and for him alone.
