We’d be making more profit if we’d
insulated the roof with Fibreglass
Why Fibreglass? Because Fibre-
glass is the best cost/performance
insulation in the world.
Fibreglass saves capital costs, saves
operating costs, and needs no maintenance.
Fibreglass saves an extra 6% on heat
loss compared with the same thickness of
any similar insulation material.
Fibreglass gives greater efficiency with
less weight, saving roof construction cost.
Fibreglass saves on heating and cooling
equipment because its greater efficiency
allows the use of smaller units in heating
and cooling systems.
And you save on maintenance because
Fibreglass won’t warp, rot, shrink or sag.
It is non-corrosive, mould-proof, moisture
resistant and will not burn. Fibreglass
lasts forever and never loses its insulation
value.
Fibreglass Wool Insulation is made in
several forms to meet every need of the
architect , engineer or property owner
Roll Blankets , “Friction Fit Batts ”, Sub-
Deck and Roof Insulation.

Woolen mittens may be a small item, but they
show the scope of C. Itoh activities. One of
Japan’s oldest and largest trading companies,
C. Itoh buys the wool in Australia, imports it
into Japan and exports the finished products
(all wool or blended with synthetic fibres) to
the world. And this is only one of over 20,000
items, handled by C. Itoh & Co. experts in
import, export, joint investment ventures and
triangular trade.
Whether you’re selling igloos to Eskimos or
selling or buying anything almost anywhere in
the world, it might be a good idea to get in touch,
with an experienced C. Itoh trader at any one
of C. Itoh’s 70 overseas branches or affiliates.
He’s probably solved your trading problem
before you’ve quite found out what it is, yourself.

The difference between modern Australian and American offices
Water Coolers!
American management has found that,
workers feel better, work better and
have higher morale when they replenish
body fluids with cool drinking water.
These are facts often stated by medical
authorities.
If you have an eye for increased em-
ployee efficiency and better employee
morale, it is to your benefit to instal a
water cooler or water coolers.
Investigate Temprite water coolers
first. There are 5 good reasons:
1. Temprite water coolers can be bought
(or rented, if you do not wish to make a
capital investment).
2. Temprite water coolers can serve from
10 to 220 employees efficiently, effect-
ively and economically.
3. There are Temprite coolers designed
for every office and plant . . . small or
large. Some models take only 1 square
foot of space. Every model can be
placed near the work area.
4. There is a five year warranty on each
Temprite.
5. Temprite is manufactured in Australia
by Kelvinator, a national name in indus-
trial refrigeration.

Capsuled Culture
hope,” Sydney’s Lord Mayor
’ * Jensen said In his tape-recorded
speech prior to the entombment of the
L. J. Hooker Time Capsule, “that those
who open this capsule 500 years hence
will find a picture of Australian family
life intact.” Inside the hollow alumi-
nium alloy ball about the size of a
World War II sea mine were samples
of what was described as “20th century
culture”. These included money, an
electric shaver, candy bars, a telephone,
newspaper clippings, nylon stockings,
bottles of beer, a Bible, a turf guide,
and a jar of instant coffee.
The influence of sponsors on the “cul-
tural” selection will probably be as
noticeable five centuries in the future as
it was last week in the Angel Arcade
basement off Pitt Street. The coffee
was Bushell’s, the beer Toohey’s, the
chocolates Hoadley’s. All three were
suggested by onlookers as possibly the
“typical Australian family’s breakfast”
section of the capsule’s contents. The
typical dinner (chicken and beans) and
the typical lunch (mixed grill) were
inside polythene bags.
“You’d be surprised how many people
wrote to us requesting that a Bible be
included,” Mr L. J. Hooker told us. “To
be quite frank with you,” he added,
“until then we hadn't considered putting
one in.”
After Alderman Jensen’s taped speech
was inserted in its plastic container and
placed atop the capsule’s contents with
instructions how to play it back, the
capsule was sealed with 102 screws,
emptied of air and filled with argon gas.
It was then lowered into a 12ft-deep
hole and interred. “There’s a £25
Commonwealth Savings Bank account
inside, too,” a PR man told us. “Accord-
ing to our calculations the computed
interest on that £25 would be £37,000
after 500 years. But as it’s the bank's
gift it won’t pay the interest.”
There is no TV set in the capsule:
they couldn't find one small enough.
The A rab
\ T Lome, Victoria, last week Alistair
L Smith said: “ ‘The Arab’ has seen its
best days. You can only do this sort of
thing night after night for so long. I
think I’m getting a bit old.”
This was disturbing news. The Arab
at Lome is a sort of young people’s
shrine, and a big success story in youth-
ful enterprise. Three brothers, Alistair,
Graham and Robin Smith started it
back in 1956, when Alistair was 20.
Graham, a ballet dancer, now in London,
had a real gift for design: black walls,
canvas roof, hessian .rugs over concrete
floors ... to give the real far-out look.
The Arab was a success from the
start. So many young people crowded
in they couldn’t sit them down; the drill
was to put them on the floor. So Alistair
established an Australian first which has
been the charm and power of The Arab
since—the first restaurant in Australia to
do away with chairs and put its customer
on the floor.
Then for staff they used university
students, girls dressed in their usual
skin-tight slacks with tiny butcher’s
aprons. “The idea of non-professional
waitresses is not without point. The
girls come for a short time, they know
nothing about it. But they’re enthusias-
tic, they’re fun and they’re all one with
the customers. That’s what makes The
Arab go.”
By 1960 The Arab was too popular
and they needed something to drain off
the night crowd. They rented an old
dance hall by the beach and called it
the “Wild Colonial”. By just a few
inspired adjustments they made The
Colonial an even bigger hit than The
Arab. For example, you have to climb
up a ladder and go through a near-trap-
door to get in. Once inside you make
a grand debut down an ancient staircase.
The place is dimly lit by red lanterns
and decorated with old bedsteads, iron
kettles, harness, car springs, everything
that’s old and irresistible. In The Wild
Colonial one is hideously overdressed in
shoes. This week the Spinning Wheels
is the performing group, shaggier and
even noisier than the Rolling Stones.
For years now it has been the tradi-
tion to see the New Year in outside The
Arab. To the embarrassment of the
Smith brothers and the police they get
anything up to 3-4000 noise-making out-
siders.
Alistair admitted there had been diffi-
cult moments. New Year’s Eve, two
years ago, the police became worried and
decided to clear the area with fire hoses.
“An hilarious situation followed,” said
Alistair. “Only a trickle of water came
out of the hoses. So one kid stripped
off his clothes and danced up to the
hose ‘Go on wet me, wet me!’ Soon
everyone was doing it. There were dra-
matic stories in the newspapers, but it
was pretty harmless really. We’ve never
ever had a sheet of glass broken at The
Arab.”
Now the Smiths have opened their ski
lodge at Mt Buller, licensed, accommoda-
tion for 150 and an investment “well
over £20,000.” Inside it has “the atmos-
phere of a cave” and it is called “The
Abominable”. So the Smiths now have a
year-round enterprise. As soon as the
waves turn cold, they close The Arab and
move to The Abominable.
But as haunts everyone, from Johnny
O’Keefe to John Lennon, there’s the
problem of the years. In his 28th year
Alistair is wondering whether he’s too old
for The Arab.
Hello, Dolly
1%/I'r Fred Hebert was quite definite
-*■*■*- when we asked who is box office
on Broadway these days. “There are
just five stars whom angels will back
without hesitation: Carol Channing,
Ethel Merman, Gwen Verdon, Mary
Martin and Rosalind Russell. Sammy
Davis Jnr is the only American male
star who could carry any show at the
box office. Richard Burton, Sir John
Gielgud and Paul Schofield are sell-outs
in the right vehicle but big Hollywood
stars like Jack Lemmon, Burt Lancaster
and Charlton Heston have all flopped on
Broadway.”
The only two up-and-comings Mr
Hebert could think of were Barbra
Streisand and Carol Burnett but they had

yet to prove their durability, box office-
wise. “The casualty rate is more than
70 per cent of shows that make Broad-
way. Annual losses to investors were
estimated at £2i million last year. It’s
an arguable estimate but probably fairly
close to the mark,” he said.
Here to direct the JCW production of
one of the surviving 30 per cent —“Hello,
Dolly”—affable, urbane Mr Hebert, now
53, looks even more like Alfred Hitch-
cock’s younger brother than he did when
last in Australia eight years ago to direct
“The Pajama Game”. A strong be-
liever in out-of-town try-outs for new
shows, he is faced with a “first-up” open-
ing of “Dolly” in Sydney late next month.
He is now auditioning to find some 36
Australians to help him re-create the
Broadway hit. “Mind you, we’re more
than half-way there, having the same sets,
costumes and staging that Oliver Smith
designed for the original show. (He
did ‘Camelot’, remember, and ‘Dolly’
is every bit as lavish.) Then we’ve got
three Americans—Carole Cook, Jack
Good and Bill Mullikin —that both the
show’s authors are ecstatic about. I'm
sure there’s more than enough talent in
this country to fill the rest of the cast.
No, I don’t mind working within the
framework of another director’s creation.
Gower Champion did a wonderful job
with ‘Dolly’ in New York. I have to
do more than just re-create that impact,
though. I’ve got to mould different per-
formers to give it what they’ve got.
Champion had the same job with Chan-
ning.”
American accents, Mr Hebert said,
weren’t much of a problem for Aus-
tralian actors. “Last time I was here
there was one guy I had to take aside
for 20 minutes every day and teach him
to say ‘say’ instead of ‘sigh’ but even he
got it right by opening night. 1 think
Australians pick up American a lot
easier than Americans catch on to Aus-
tralian.”
Laughs usually come in exactly the
same places with a Sydney audience as
a New York one, he went on “It’s
much easier to know how an American
show will go in Sydney than in London.
That London is one helluva place to
sell the American sense of humor. Out
here you at least know that the people
understand the same language, theatre-
wise.”
How do out-of-town audiences in
America give reliable clues to more
sophisticated Broadway audiences’ re-
actions? “Well, it’s really the critics who
help most. Eliott Norton of Boston is
probably the dean of American theatre
critics. We take a lot of notice of his
suggestions. And then there's the sort of
audience you get in places like New
Haven. Yale-type audiences used to see-
ing a show creaking in all the wrong
places. They’re joined by interested
New Yorkers who love to see a show fail
in its infancy. Yes, you get a pretty
good idea what sort of play you’ve got
and who your friends are at New 7 Haven.”
The Wimpy Invasion
TTsed as we have become to the fatty
mince steak and soggy roll ham-
burger vended in these parts, we were
intrigued to meet suave, thirtyish Oliver
C. Shaul; a man dedicated to bringing
us the “near perfect” hamburger. Mr
Shaul, who told us he was once mana-
ging director of Federal Hotels, is now
a hotel and catering consultant. He
recently acquired the franchise of the
Anglo-American Wimpy hamburger
concern.
Wimpy, Mr Shaul told us, took its
name from the hamburger-consuming
Popeye character, and opened up in Chi-
cago about fourteen years ago. Today,
it appears, Wimpy shops sell ham-
burgers in Britain, where 350 shops
operate, and have spread across Europe
through France, Germany, Italy and
Holland. They fry about 50 million
hamburgers a year.
Wasn't the introduction of a new
hamburger chain somewhat precarious
with so many places already vending
the mince beef-between-roll? Mr Shaul
held up his hand. “There are,” he de-
clared, “no comparable hamburgers
in Australia. These are produced from
a special cut of beef. Only 281bs of a
500 to 8001 b carcass is used. This
prime beef is minced through two bores,
spices from a secret mixture are added
and the bun is baked to a special for-
mula.”
Mr Shaul said he didn't think compe-
titors could match the quality of the
Wimpy, which would, he admitted, be
more expensive because of its more
choice preparation.
Not directly concerned with the actual
production, Mr Shaul represents the
British franchise holders—Lyons, the
caterers of Corner House fame. With
the first shop opened in Sydney recently,
he is currently negotiating with interests
in Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide.
The Cover
npms week’s cover, by Douglass Bag-
lin, shows cadets at the Kings
School, Parramatta. It is the only school
in Australia where the school uniform
worn daily is in a military style. The
school was founded in 1831, and claims
to be the country's oldest, but, since it
closed down for one year, Launceston's
Church Grammar School, founded in
1846, claims a longer continuous record.
RACE RELATIONS IN THE ENLIGHTENED CENTURY
feulletU i
80 Years Ago: February 7, 1885
At the Circuit Court recently held
in Palmerston (Q), the largest
criminal calendar ever known in the
North was dealt with, and yet not
a single white malefactor appeared
upon the programme. Five darkies
and one moon-faced heathen were
sentenced to death for thinning the
population with axes, spears, and
waddies, and eight other “yellows
and blacks” were boosted up to
various terms of imprisonment for
assault and unlawful wounding. Of
course, the missionaries put this un-
desirable state of affairs down to
too much snaik-juice but the traders
just as confidently assert that it's due
to too much Bible.
At the Tamworth Quarter Sessions
last week, an Aboriginal was sen-
tenced to 10 years’ imprisonment for
horse stealing. “Do you understand
the almost unprecedented gravity of
your sorrowful position?” enquired
the Judge, before sentencing the pri-
soner. “Under the code of jurispru-
dence laid down by the Amended
Criminal Law Consolidation Act (71st
section of the 59th) it will be impos-
sible for me, in the conscientious dis-
charge of my judicial duties, to do
otherwise than pass upon you a sen-
tence which cannot otherwise be
characterised than as a meed of
exemplary punishment. Prisoner,
have you anything to say?” The
dusky desperado, who had fallen
asleep three times during the delivery
of the majestic address, suddenly
woke up when the Judge had finished,
and, in a dazed tone, ejaculated
“You got em ’bacca?”

No Peace for Mr Wetherell
T'he decision of the Executive Coun-
cil of Australian Jewry to consider
challenging the legal validity of the
new NSW primary school religious in-
struction syllabus and meanwhile to
advise Jewish parents to withdraw
their children from classes during
religious instruction classes is not
surprising, however disappointing it
must be to Mr E. Wetherell, the NSW
Minister for Education, who obviously
hoped that the compromise religious
syllabus he introduced last December
would meet with universal approval.
The basic point is that Mr Wether-
ell’s original syllabus, imperfect though
it may have been, was the best possible
one in view of the requirements of
the Public Instruction Act that there
be “general religious teaching” but no
“polemical or dogmatic theology”. It
squared this circle by providing for in-
struction in all major religions with
an emphasis on the virtues they all
encouraged. This was open to the
immediate objection from the
churches that it treated all religions
as equal, and the Protestant leaders
were quick to anger. Their point of
view is perfectly clear and consistent
and in their own terms they were
right to be angry. But without re-
gard to the requirements of the Act
they insisted that Christianity get a
special emphasis in primary schools,
and Mr Wetherell, in due course,
capitulated. Now, of course, the
syllabus is offensive to Jews (and
there are 6000 Jewish primary school
children in Sydney alone) who natur-
ally want to know why Protestants
should be allowed to breach the Public
Instruction Act simply because they
are politically powerful. The Execu-
tive Council is not only right in advis-
ing Jewish parents to withdraw their
children from the classes but in con-
sidering going to court to insist that
the Public Instruction Act be en-
forced without respect to the wishes
of politically powerful groups,
Mr Wetherelrs original syllabus
, . A . J T , .
was what the Act requires. This
sim P ] y , that eac \ religious
§ rou P whlch believes, as they all do
and most, only its religion and no
other is true, has an extra duty to
teach its faith outside the school,
They should not expect a secular
school system to become the instru-
ment of one religious group.
Dr Winks Rides Again
XjhGHTEEN months ago the American
Professor Robin Winks made the
unexpected suggestion that Australia
should invite 50,000 Negroes from the
United States to settle in Melbourne.
One can only guess why he chose Mel-
bourne but he obviously chose Ame-
rican Negroes because this would cut
through the official argument that the
Australian immigration policy is based
not on skin color but on culture. Cul-
turally speaking, that is, in terms of
language, religion and way of life,
American Negroes are as akin to Aus-
tralians as white Americans. The rea-
son they and not white Americans are
excluded can only be their color.
Naturally this became the occasion
for a ritualistic repetition of the of-
ficial defences of our immigration
policy. The Minister for Immigration
reminded Professor Winks, for ex-
ample, that 30,000 non-Europeans
live here, that 200 Asians settle here
each year and that we have an Asian
student population of about 12,000.
All of which is very true but did not
meet Professor Winks’ point.
Now Professor Winks has return-
ed to his theme in a more sober
mood, and, writing in a survey of Mal-
aysian Commonwealth relations pub-
lished in Singapore last week, has
conceded that Australia is not as bad
as its foreign critics or its masochistic
citizens made out. But he repeated
that it is in our own interests to recon-
sider our immigration policy. What is
the sense, for example, in encouraging
Asian students to come here to study
and then after a certain period telling
them to get out or be deported? It
would at least be consistent for Aus-
tralia to refuse to have Asian students
here, but it is absurd to invite them in
then throw them out, and then expect
them to feel goodwill towards us.
The point is that it would be such
a simple matter to remedy the defects
in our immigration policy. Only a fool
or someone who hates his country
would want to see Australia flooded
with migrants, wherever they may
come from. All that is required is
that there be quotas, such as there now
are for European countries, and that
the quotas be administered so that the
standard health and educational re-
quirements of would-be migrants be
met. We could do worse than start
by encouraging those Asian students
who have lived here and want to stay
here to do so.
The Glut
T'he proposal to give India one mil-
lion tons of wheat has provided
the Federal Government with a chance
to demonstrate not only generosity
but the enlightened self-interest which
recognises that foreign aid and trade
are a continuation of foreign policy
by other means.
This opportunity has arisen prim-
arily because of our expected wheat
surplus. A world survey of the Inter-
national Wheat Council reports that
for the first time in many years Aus-
tralia will have to carry significant
stocks of wheat into the next season.
The glut is already so embarrassingly
big that silos are at bursting point
and railway services are strained be-
yond capacity to cope with storage
and transport of the biggest wheat lift
of all time.
There is no other country in Asia
with whom our long-term interests
are more closely tied than India. Yet
it is ironical that while we are
smoothly efficient in our sales of wheat
to Red China and our continued pro-
vision of technical and economic aid
to Indonesia, a proposal to give India
wheat in a time of food crisis has had
to go to an “inter-departmental” com-
mittee for consideration.
A gift of wheat to India at this
point would, therefore, be not only an
act of friendship but would help make
clear that on major issues of foreign
policy it is the Government, not the
Wheat Board, which takes the initi-
ative. When one thinks on the China
trade one sometimes wonders.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Isa: What Really Happened
How Communists exploited Government folly and AWU bureaucracy
BRISBANE The debate as to
whether more harm is caused by ignor-
ance and irresponsibility on the one hand,
or deliberate and contrived malice on
the other has often occupied the minds
of historians. It is a fine point still
to be decided in relation to the Mt Isa
strike, which has led to the imposition
of decrees by the Queensland Govern-
ment rarely invoked by a civilian
Government in Australia.
The AWU has taken a deliberate stand
on the proposition that, whatever its
origins, the Mt Isa strike has reached its
present stage only because it has become
part and parcel of a Communist plan to
attack both Queensland development
and the AWU.
The current issue of the Queensland
“Worker”, organ of the largest branch
of the AWU, puts it in these words:
“The dispute at Mt Isa is no longer an
industrial dispute. The big part, and the
main part, is Communist infiltration and
Communist domination of sections of the
trade union movement, particularly in
big production areas that can be regarded
as the essence of industries that are
peculiar to the defence of a country.
“It is no different at Mt Isa. Indeed
quite recently more positive identification
of a Communist cell in Mt Isa has be-
come known. The discovery of docu-
ments shows that the pipe line of the
set up of a Communist cell in Mt Isa
emanated in the first place from Ade-
laide.”
This view has influential backing from
the clergy of all denominations in Mt Isa
EDGAR WILLIAMS
itself, who, last week, issued a joint
statement urging a return to work on the
ground that, whatever its antecedents,
the strike was now effectively under
Communist control.
This proposition which in effect
represents the position of the Govern-
ment, the AWU and the various relig-
ious denominations looks more and
more probable. When one appreciates
the list of industrial gains which have
been made by the miners as a result of
the conference presided over by
Commissioner Harvey there is little left
to be won. As The Bulletin pointed out
in its last issue these include the follow-
ing:
An increase of 33i per cent in the
contract price while six-hour conditions
applied, a provision that all contracts
be signed within 24 hours in which
the agreement was made and copies of
the contract be made available to repre-
sentatives of the contract parties and
union representatives on the contract
reference board; greater recognition by
contract reference board; a simplified
grievance procedure, which will be intro-
duced into the Mount Isa mines award,
by consent of the parties, to speed up
the handling of disputes; greater
responsibility be placed with the com-
pany for the supply of machines and
equipment for the use of contractors.
These were only some of the gains be-
sides £3 wage increase granted by the
State Industrial Commission.
Yet, if today the strike is effectively
under the control of the Communist
Party, through the Brisbane Trades and
Labor Council (whose officials have
carefully changed their tactics in the
course of the operation) it is pretty
clear that it did not begin this way.
This is not so much an example of an
operation carefully planned and con-
ducted by the Communist Party from
the beginning, but rather an example of
clever opportunism in getting hold of
the steering wheel of a car originally
set in motion by someone else.
The inexperience of the Nicklin
Government in its handling of indus-
trial matters was never shown in worse
light than in its 1961 amendment of
the State Industrial Conciliation and
Arbitration Act, as The Bulletin
pointed out at the time. This, inter alia,
removed the power of the State Indus-
trial Commission to increase the bonus
which Mt Isa Mines, following the
PAT MACKIE
similar example at Broken Hill, paid
and pays to all of its employees.
The extraordinary situation was
created that the Commission in effect
had power to reduce or even abrogate
the bonus. It did not have the power to
increase it. The resultant situation was
not only absurd as far as industrial
relationships between the company and
its workers was concerned. It struck at
the very basis of arbitration. The work-
ers were being told that arbitration
could only cut their income. Any
increases had to be gained outside arbi-
tration through a system of collective
bargaining. (And those who have
uncritically lauded collective bargaining
in recent years have only to look at
the Mt Isa mess.)
Guilty of folly
Tt was ironic that, almost immediately
after this amendment, the price of the
various base metals produced on the
field rose on world markets. Nothing
would persuade the workers that they
were not being “robbed'’ •of benefits
which they would have gained under the
old system whereby the bonus fluctu-
ated in accordance with prices on the
world market. And in fact they were
right. The Government was guilty of
folly in pushing such an amendment.
The company, with the history of simi-
lar events at Broken Hill before it
if it ever looked at history was
even more foolish to take its stand on
the amended law.
It is now a year since the AWU
approached the Commisson for a straight
wage rise of £4 a week. It was in
August that the Commission rejected
this application on the ground that
this was equivalent to an increase in
the bonus which it had no power
to grant. Months later, on appeal by the
AWU, and after a new legal interpre-
tation by Mr Justice Hanger in the Indus-
trial Court, the Industrial Commission

felt itself able to give the men a “pros-
perity loading” of £3 a week.
To the man on the job it looked like
evasion to distinguish between a bonus
and a “prosperity loading” and a
victory for strong-arm methods.
The original motivation behind the
miners’ local leader Mackie and the
Mt Isa Trades and Labor Council can
best be understood in “syndicalist”
terms. The first claim made by Alec
McDonald, Communist Secretary of the
Brisbane Trades and Labor Council, that
his body should have charge of the
dispute was met with a pretty rough
rejoinder. The Mt Isa Trades and Labor
Council, then insisted on being regarded
as the bargaining authority. It wanted no
help from anyone in this regard, whether
the AWU in whom many of the miners
had lost confidence, or the Brisbane
Trades Hall whose Communist affiliations
were well-known.
The original position of the Mt Isa
body has its roots in the analogy of
the special status established for itself
over the years by the Barrier Industrial
Council, which controls unionism in
Broken Hill without any regard for
the ACTU or the Sydney Trades Hall;
partly in the tough physical demands of
work in the pioneering environment of
a company town; partly in the fact that
up to 40 nationalities were to be found
among the company’s employees; but
above all in the fact that the AWU is
too big, too bureaucratic and too
impersonal.
Origin of Mackie
authority in the AWU is concentra-
ted in the State and Federal
offices. The State office was about 1000
miles from the scene of the dispute.
The filing and original rejection
of the AWU’s application all took place
in Brisbane, in another world. The
AWU’s District Organiser had practi-
cally no powers, and he was certainly
far more experienced in handling the
pastoral award than the miners’ prob-
lems. The State Secretary of the AWU,
Mr E. Williams, was in Mt Isa last
September but did not get back until
early January.
In this situation it was inevitable that
a vacuum should develop and that local
leaders should substitute themselves for
an invisible AWU authority. This was
the origin of Mackie and of the auto-
nomist claims of the Mt Isa Trades and
Labor Council. There is no doubt that
among many of the men today it is
a toss-up as to whether the company or
the AWU is more bitterly opposed.
As a syndicalist operation, confined
to Mt Isa, there is little doubt that the
gains made by the January conference
would have ended the strike. What
prolongs it is that the Communists,
repulsed in their first attempt to take
the strike over and run it from their
own centre of operations in the Bris-
bane Trades Hall, suddenly woke up
and changed their tactics, although not
their strategy.
Understanding that any Brisbane
agency was unpopular even with those
who wanted to continue the strike in
order to secure the reinstatement of
Mackie by the company, the Commun-
ists McDonald and Nanson promi-
nent — put a different face on their
intervention. Now they appeared as
men who simply wanted to help. Wher-
ever Mackie went, he went with the aid
and comfort of these new helpers who
had many facilities at their disposal.
Stoppage threat
from the AWU, and there-
fore a non-unionist, he got a new
union ticket from the obliging Commu-
nist-controlled Painters’ Union. It was the
Brisbane Trades and Labor Council
which in recent days demanded the
intervention of the ACTU on behalf of
its Mt Isa proteges. It was the Mel-
bourne district of the AEU, under the
control of the Victorian Communist
Carmichael, which threatened a nation-
wide stoppage of AEU members
which a Communist-controlled Com-
monwealth Council has power to order
if any AELT man was penalised under
the new Queensland Government decrees.
The situation was thus perfectly set
up for the Communist Party. All reason-
able industrial claims had been met or
w'ere the subject of further appeal. But
Mackie and the Mt Isa Trades and
Labor Council still had several inflama-
tory issues, particularly that of Mackie’s
reinstatement. Whatever opposition there
was to a continuation of the strike now
that the industrial gains had been made
was effectively silenced by standover
tactics of which the mass meeting of
January 16 was a perfect example
Williams being hooted off the stage of
the Star Theatre by a well-organised
mob.
By keeping Mackie and the Mt Isa
Tradejs and Labor Council in the fore-
front, judiciously priming them with
assistance of many kinds, the Commun-
ists could hope to smash the authority
of the AWU in the Mt' Isa field. They
could not be certain that they would
eventually be able to control the local
Trades and Labor Council, and avoid
the type of development which has taken
place at Broken Hill which has never
helped them much. That, however, was
the problem of another day. The prob-
lem of today was to keep the inflam-
mable issues at Isa alight and to destroy
the authority of the AWU in this region.
For the Queensland Communists hav©
been set the notable objective of ham-
stringing the entire Queensland develop-
mental programme. The revival of the
long defunct Gladstone Trades and
Labor Council on November 15 last, at
a meeting addressed by Alec McDonald,
is aimed at imposing control over the
work force to be employed at the
£s2m. alumina plant to be established
in that centre. This again is to be a
contest between the Communists and
the AWU. Obviously the Communists
have decided that, as far as Mt Isa is
concerned, they must run the risk of
an autonomous Trades and Labor
Council, to be taken over at a later
stage. They will run no such risk at
Gladstone where they are in control of
the operation from the beginning.
The entry of Dr J. Cairns and Mr
Clyde Cameron into the scene on the
part of the Mt Isa strike leaders can
be regarded as a personal matter in
the latter instance, but as an ideological
exercise in the case of the former.
Cameron is determined to destroy I.
Dougherty and the present controlling
apparatus of the AWU. No one in his
senses will doubt that whatever Cameron
has in mind, the residuary legatees of
this act of destruction will be the Com-
munist Party. Cairns has consciously
based his future in the Labor Party on

the extreme Left, in which the delega-
tions of the Communist-controlled
unions are the most important section.
By focusing attention on the fact that
Mt Isa mines is a “monopoly”, and a
foreign one at that, he integrates the
campaign with a popular and growing
nationalist sentiment, and the Commun-
ist Party’s current “anti-monopoly
campaign”.
What are the lessons of the Mt Isa
strike? They can perhaps be summed up
under five heads:
(1) The entire Queensland Develop-
mental programme, so important to
Australian development, will be the
scene of a major Communist attack.
Mt Isa is only the first chapter.
(2) Blundering Government legislation
like the 1961 amendment furnishes a
golden opportunity for the Communist
Party and other troublemakers.
(3) The AWU is as remote as any
business monopoly from the lives and
conditions of men who will be working
in a challenging physical environment
in which union bureaucracy cannot pro-
vide the answers without active engage-
ment by men on the spot.
(4) The battle to fight the Communist
Party’s Queensland operation will be
fought very largely in the craft unions
affiliated to the Brisbane Trades and
Labor Council.
(5) While dedicated anti-Communists
on the spot in these many develop-
mental projects will no doubt fight the
battle, they will be fighting under great
handicaps so long as the Queensland
branch of the ALP is decisively influenc-
ed by Communist - controlled Brisbane
Trades Hall and so long as Federal
Labor refuses to take the gloves off
against the friends of the Communists
in its own party room.
RELIGION
New Catholic Split
The Decline of the “Catholic Worker ”
MELBOURNE The Melbourne
“Catholic Worker” was, until recent
years, the only serious, independent voice
of Australia’s Catholic laity. Originally
a broadsheet of social and political com-
ment aimed at reforming modern capi-
talism, it is now a middle to highbrow
magazine devoted to theology, Church
affairs, foreign policy and Australian
politics. The most famous issue of the
“Catholic Worker” was published in
July, 1959: it included a long and critical
analysis of the composition and activi-
ties of the Santamaria “movement”,
which it attacked as being responsible
for:
1. The resurgence of long dead false
prejudices against the Church and
Catholics and, in particular, the false
charge that the mission of the Church
is political conquest rather than the
salvation of souls. 2. A diminution of
fraternal charity both within the Church
and Australian society in general. 3.
The disruption of parliamentary gov-
ernment in Australia. 4. The further-
ance and strengthening of Communist
influence in Australia.”
The final charge in particular must
have stirred the normally imperturbable
B. A. Santamaria, who was one of the
chief members of the original commit-
tee which founded the “Catholic
Worker” in 1936. He broke with the
paper a decade later. The “Catholic
Worker” met with attack from two
directions after its exposure of the
“movement”. A number of critics asked
why, since the “Catholic Worker” knew
so much about the allegedly nefarious
activities of the “movement”, it had
waited until 1959, four years after the
ALP split, to publicise them.
The other attack came from Arch-
bishop Mannix, who, not long after the
July, 1959, issue, sent a circular letter
to his parish priests advising them that
he did not regard the “Catholic Worker”
favorably and that it would no longer
be sold outside St Patrick’s Cathedral.
Church sales, the major source of income
for the “Catholic Worker”, were deci-
mated throughout Victoria, and circula-
tion fell in a few months from about
30,000 to 5,000. The “Catholic Worker”
fought back through its columns: it
increased its attacks on the “movement”
and its influence in the Church in Aus-
tralia. At the same time the magazine
kept up its own broadside against Com-
munism in Australia and printed a num-
ber of well-informed analyses of the
operations of the Communist Party in
the ALP and Australian life generally.
Over the last couple of years a per-
ceptible change has occurred in the
balance of “Catholic Worker” articles
on Communism, the ALP, and foreign
policy. This has been the subject of
trenchant censure by a group of gradu-
ate and undergraduate Catholics in the
latest issue of the roneod broadsheet
“Critic”, a magazine usually concerned
with educational and social comment.
“Critic” opens with a heavy right: “The
‘Catholic Worker’ has outlived its use-
fulness. This can be readily seen from
the recent articles on dialogue with
Communists, from the comments of
‘Marum’ (a regular ‘CW’ columnist,
who is generally believed to be a leading
Melbourne lawyer) on Communism over
the years, and from the obsessive con-
cern with the alleged nefarious doings
of the National Council.”
Significance of the attack by “Critic”
is that none of its signatories, K. C.
Devine, J. Horward, P. O'Brien, P.
Morgan, B. White and R. W. Browning,
is a member of the DLP or The National
Civic Council, and all of them claim to be
opposed to what are termed “movement
attitudes” to the Church. Each of the
six is, in fact, a member of the Mel-
bourne University ALP Club. The
“Critic” article highlights the developing
friction amongst educated, non-“move-
ment”, Australian Catholics over atti-
tudes to the ALP, Communist sub-
version and South-East Asia.

“Catholic Worker”, but not wholly domi-
nant in that magazine, appears to be
mostly concerned with dialogue with
those it considers to be “radicals” (Left-
wingers in the ALP), with theological
issues which have immediate social rele-
vance (the pill, ecumenism), and with the
virtues of diplomacy, toleration and
charity in international affairs. Its forma-
tive political experience appears to have
been its encounter with the “movement”
and it has a genuine horror of the way in
which Catholic political groups often
arouse religious and political antago-
nisms.
It seriously considers that the dangers
of Communism to and in Australia have
been vastly exaggerated (M. J. Charles-
worth, “An anti-Communist Obsession”,
“CW”, May, 1961). A lot of time and
energy is given to countering anti-Com-
munists.
The other group treats Communist
subversion in Australia and South-East
Asia as the major political issue of the
day. Although it prefers to work with
moderate elements in the ALP it bears
no grudges against the DLP and is wil-
ling to co-operate with any non-ratbag,
anti-totalitarian body. It has a special
dislike for the kind of attitudes typified by
Dr Cairns, Leslie Haylen and Sam Gold-
bloom. It has made a sophisticated study
of the tactics of subversion and is aware
of the importance and value of tame
Catholics to Australian manipulators of
the “united front”.
LAW
The Committal
To the Attorney-General
SYDNEY When, in a last-minute
volte face, counsel for Mr Ray Maher
last week urged that he be committed for
trial on a charge of indecent exposure,
it was the final sensation in the initial
hearing which Sydney’s Chief Stipendi-
ary Magistrate, Mr A. E. Stonham, had
earlier described as “a case in which
surprise follows surprise so much that
I can no longer be surprised by anything
that might happen here”.
One of the late surprises was the
appearance in court of a Parliament
House typist, Miss Robyn McCauley,
just before Mr Stonham was to deliver
his finding on whether Mr Maher
should be committed for trial by jury
or discharged. (Miss McCauley had been
said by Mr Maher to have remained be-
hind alone in his office after the Parlia-
ment House Christmas party “to discuss
important business”. During that dis-
cussion, he said, she told him that Miss
Elizabeth Shepherd “had the knife in”
for him.)
Now Mr Clive Evatt, QC (watching
for Miss Shepherd), had handed Mr Kerr,
QC (for the Crown), a written statement
by Miss McCauley. Mr Kerr asked Mr
Stonham to reopen the case and admit
the statement in evidence. Mr Smyth,
QC (for Maher), objected, claiming that
the Crown case had closed on the previ-
ous day. Mr Stonham read the state-
ment and said part of it dealt with “an
attempt to suborn a witness” and should
be heard. Mr Smyth said it was in-
admissible. Mr Kerr said Mr Smyth
had presented Mr Maher as a man of
“unblemished character” and Miss Shep-
herd as a liar. Mr Stonham agreed and
said the Crown should be given the
chance, in the light of Miss McCauley’s
statement, to discredit Mr Maher.
After a brief adjournment Mr Ston-
ham said that “in all fair play” the new
evidence concerning Mr Maher should
be heard. He ruled that it was admissible
and the case should reopen immediately.
Mr Smyth immediately rose. “If that
is your considered opinion then I prefer
to withdraw my previous submission that
Mr Maher be discharged and urge that
Your Worship take a certain course,” he
said. “You mean now commit the defen-
dant for trial by jury?” asked Mr Ston-
ham. “Yes. I would prefer that in the
circumstances,” replied Mr Smyth.
Mr Kerr said he could hardly object
as it was his task as prosecutor to ensure
a committal. Mr Stonham then com-
mitted Mr Maher for trial on February 2,
granted him bail of £5O and a surety of
£5O (pointing out that the Justices Act
required the surety) and discharged Mr
Maher on the second identical charge of
indecent exposure brought against him
by Miss Shepherd. Mr Kerr asked if he
might have Miss McCauley’s statement.
“No. I am sending it to the Attorney-
General,” replied Mr Stonham.
The court then adjourned and—as Mr
Maher left to attend to details of his
surety and bail—Miss Shepherd and Miss
McCauley embraced.

EDUCATION
Teachers’ Ban?
Family troubles in class
MELBOURNE Victorian teachers
are threatening to boycott an experiment
in health education. The experiment,
prompted chiefly by Dr B. McCloskey of
the Child Health Section of the Victorian
Health Department, is scheduled to begin
this year with a training course for
volunteer teachers while its introduction
to about 20 selected schools will not be
until 1966. Dr McCloskey’s scheme has
strong support from doctors, psychiatrists
and the Education Department, but the
two big teachers’ organisations, the Vic-
torian Secondary Teachers’ Association
and the Victorian Teachers’ Union, have
both opposed its introduction.
Last week both the VTU and the
VSTA at meetings passed resolutions
refusing to participate. The latest draft
of the First Form Syllabus, written by
Mrs V. Erwin, an American experienced
in the field, proposes to deal not only
with physical health and community
facilities but with emotional health and
mental vitality. Children will be asked to
reflect on the ingredients of a happy
family life, on their own “identity” and
on their attitudes to the opposite sex.
Teachers in opposition claim that
the acceptable parts of the courses
are already catered for in the traditional
subjects of English, biology and social
studies. They doubt that young children
are capable of the insight necessary to
discuss personal identity or family hap-
piness. Teachers dread the prospect of
bringing family disturbances into the
open classroom and generally regard the
course as an encroachment on the legi-
timate intellectual role of the school by
ideas that should be formed by the
home, the churches and social institu-
tions.
Plainly the course will be accepted
unless the teachers (its only strong op-
ponents) fight hard. It has the sanction
of weighty persons and an excellent de-
partmental camouflage. If the experiment
in the 20 schools is a success the course
will gradually be introduced to all schools
in the State within the next 15 years.
POLITICS
Pirates
No Time For SC
ADELAIDE The Social Credit
movement in South Australia hopes to
have the State Senate election declared
void because, according to its president
Mr M. E. Dodd, the Australian Broad-
casting Commission breached the Com-
monwealth Electoral Act by withholding
free radio time to some political parties,
including Social Credit, during the elec-
tion campaign. This is being petitioned
by the movement in the Court of Dis-
puted Returns.
However, it is unlikely that this will
succeed. Even so it will be good publicity
for Social Credit which recently revealed
that it might operate a pirate radio sta-
tion from a boat off the SA coast during
election times—an idea which grew from
dissatisfaction over election broadcasts.
Plans for the pirate station, still in the
embryo stage, envisage a powerful trans-
mitter (able to reach 120 miles inland)
in a boat anchored up to 12 miles off-
shore.
The station would operate only during
election campaigns. Already the SC
movement has a boat available, the 100
ton schooner Moorara, owned by their
unsuccessful candidate in last year’s
Semaphore by-election, Captain G. D.
Heritage. And to demonstrate its imparti-
ality, the pirate station will give broad-
cast time to all other political parties.


What Sort of School?
Mammon , God and The State ...
“Snobbery Is
A Fact
Of Life”
By BATMAN
Snobbery has 40 per cent to do with
it. Some parents send their child-
ren to public schools in the hope,
of moving up the social scale. Oh, yes,
it is a great help in the marriage stakes
if young Alice can say that she went
to St Catherine's, Toorak College, Man-
deville Hall or wherever.
But the fear of slipping backward can
be an even stronger force. I have been
asked this beastly question: “Why do I
send my children to public schools?”
and apparently I am expected to tell
the truth. You see, I went to a public
school and all the rest of the family
went to public schools. (By “public”, of
course, I mean what NSW usually calls
“private”.)
JSomehow the retreat was cut off. As
soon as my children had been packed
off to State schools there was a nasty
feeling of guilt. I wasn't doing for
them what had been done for me. There
was a decline in standards from genera-
tion to generation. What was the old
saying?—Rags to riches in three genera-
tions; riches back to rags in the next
three.
Before 1 get rid of the snobbery rea-
son, let's thrash it thoroughly to death.
I pondered the names of the schools
and thought: “If the children have
brains, the school they go to won't mat-
ter a damn. They'll be able to go on
to the University and get themselves a
decent meal ticket as a doctor, lawyer
or, even better, a smart accountant. But
if they haven't the brains for tertiary
education, then they’re thrown on the
labor market. They'll have to look for
a job with a big commercial firm, and
though we talk a great deal about equal
opportunity, your equality has a higher
octane rating if you can say you went
to Wesley, Melbourne Grammar or
Scotch. It's snobbery, but it's one of
the facts of life.”
I can remember a young gentleman’s
story after applying for a job with a
business house in the city. “I knew
that all the directors went to Melbourne
Grammar. Naturally they asked me
where I went to school. I said 'Geelong
Grammar’, and I felt that I won a
subtle victory. Of course, it mightn’t
have been a victory in their light, but
I thought it was and that was the im-
portant thing, it gave me confidence.”
He got his job.
Even so, my advice to the public
school boy seeking a job would be to
go carefully. Nine times out of 10
schooling is an advantage, but watch for
the trap of inverse snobbery. There's
the fellow who came up the hard way
—maybe he had a much better educa-
tion than you did at a High School.
Never push a school background; wait
until it is mentioned. And most im-
portant, never, never wear an old school
tie. It's not done. I remember a pub-
lic school partner in an imposing firm
remarking. “I wouldn't employ any little
prig that came to me wearing his old
school tie. I like to know what school
he went to, but one doesn't show it off.”
As I said, snobbery had 40 per cent
to do with it, but there were other
reasons. Early in the piece I had a
rather grandiose plan. I remembered
my father saying: “I won’t be able to
leave you any money, but at least I
can do this much for you—give you a
good education.” I thought it would
be rather marvellous to do this in re-
verse ... to spend little on the boy’s
education, ensure that he went to a good
high school or technical school, then at
the age of 18 make the grand gesture:
“Here, son, is a cheque for £ISOO, the
money I would have spent in sending
you to a public school. Spend it as
you will. Use it to start your career,
go on a world trip . . .”
But I doubted my strength to really
save the money; I'd probably go off on
my own world trip, particularly as the
bonus would have to be paid to four
children.
Yet early in the piece I did send them
to State schools. I had no naive faith
in the quality of teaching at public
schools. We still have public schools
which choose teachers for their charm-
ing academic backgrounds, rather than
their teaching skill. And I knew that
the quality of the teaching at many of
the high schools was just as good as at
the public schools. It is nearly as hard
to get into Melbourne High as it is to
get into Melbourne Grammar. Both
schools like to pick the cream of the
schoolboy talent.
But when first I put children to school
I discovered that the odds were stacked
a little more against the State-trained
child. You have to be lucky. The first
school we tried was in Queensland. The
headmaster of this State school was one
of the most imaginative teachers I have
known. He had no fear of trying new
ideas and he was capable of gaining
enthusiasm from parents, teachers and
pupils, all at the one time ... a rare
feat.
Alas, we moved. The first State school
in Victoria was just possible, the next
was a disaster. It was a typical example
of poverty-stricken Victorian education.
It was an inner suburban school, just at
the end of the street. You must know
the type —red brick, high gables, no
need whatever for a school gardener or
lawnmower. The playground was a
quarter acre of black asphalt, damned
good for hop scotch, marbles and
scraped knees, but extremely uncom-
fortable for sitting or wrestling on. The
only luxury was a shed for eating one’s
lunch on wet days. The secondary
school next-door was the same, more
asphalt.
Some of the teachers were good; it
was just the atmosphere of penury that
got me down. It wasn't a poor area
either, a typical piece of well-fed
suburbia. Yet the Parents-Teachers
Association got nowhere. They would
pass a hat around to buy things for the
school, sporting equipment, new books
for a library, school telephone . . . the
aims were never very lofty. However,
most of the parents would not give more
than 2s. a week, if that. Their attitude
was “We're paying taxes to have our
children educated. It’s up to the Govern-
ment to provide these things.”
There seemed to be a fear of
establishing a precedent. Once they
started to give the Government would
provide even less. State education in
short was a Government thing. Perhaps
one would give money to a University


College, to the Church, but never to
State School. Let Mr Bolte fix it up. Of
course, the story was not the same every-
where. Some of the new schools were
superbly set up. As I said, you had
to be lucky.
We looked enviously at the big pub-
lic schools like Melbourne Grammar,
Scotch and Geelong Grammar who
wouldn’t dream of starting an appeal
under half a million. They called in the
sharp, money-raising firms to get the
money for them. It was interesting to note
that people who already paid heavily
for education could have the screws put
on them for more, even when they
couldn’t afford it.
Once we had dallied with the idea of
State Schools, naturally, we were in a
frightful fix. There were few schools
around that would have us. Melbourne
Grammar was curt to the point of rude-
ness? The child
name down at birth. By persistence
and pleading we did find a good public
school. Its comforts and advantages
were obvious. There was the heated
swimming pool, the gymnasium. There
was a dairy farm in the country where
boys gained first-hand knowledge of the
rural life. There was a language labora-
tory with equipment imported from the
US. There were all sorts of groups and
societies to cater for different interests.
An interest in music was encouraged
and it did seem to be a school which
forced a boy to think.
Public schools here, of course, are
Church schools. This was a factor to
us. We did want our children to get a
Christian education, but we would be
hypocritical if we said this was a major
force. From my experience Church
schools have never been particularly
good at turning out Christians. Indeed
there is some nice irony in this. Schools
with handsome chapels like Melbourne
Grammar and Scotch always have done
a beautiful trade in weddings. It is
easier to get married at school when
you are utterly unknown to your local
vicar.
Then there’s a final reason. A good
public school can give a boy a certain
self-assurance. We are not as good at
this as some English public schools.
They can give their product tremendous
self-confidence. They mightn’t have
taught him a single thing that was use-
ful, yet he has this veneer of import-
ance, a sort of skin that carries him
through.
So to summarise reasons we could put
down:
Snobbery, 40 per cent.
Church, 10 per cent.
Much better facilities, 20 per cent.
Chances of learning more, 20 per cent.
Self-confidence, 10 per cent.
But it was a wretched question for
an editor to ask anybody.
"Catholics
Are The
Only Liberals”
By MAX CHARLES WORTH
IF you ask me why I send my children
to a Roman Catholic school I feel
like asking in return why I should
be called on to justify my action and
why it should be put into question. For
in any genuinely Liberal society it ought
to be presumed without question that
just as the individual may choose any
moral and religious (or anti-religious)
values he wishes, so also he has the
right to choose the kind of education he
wants for his children. Thus, for John
Stuart Mill, the founding father of
English Liberalism, the right of parents
“to obtain the education (of their child-
ren) where and how they pleased” fol-
lowed directly from the principle that
each individual has the right to follow
the dictates of his own conscience and
to engage in his own personal “experi-
ments in living”. As Mill says in the
essay “On Liberty”: “The importance
of individuality of character, and diver-
sity in opinions and modes of conduct,
involves, as of the same unspeakable
importance, diversity of education”. And
as every schoolboy knows, but as a good
many Australian Liberals have preferred
to forget, Mill goes on to argue that
while the State has the right to ensure
that children are educated and also to
exercise a general supervision over edu-
cation, it has no right to become an
agency of education itself. Any form
of general State education, so he says,
is “despotism”, for if the State enters the
realm of education, by that very act it
enters the realm of personal values, the
realm where the individual conscience
ought to be sole master. For Mill, and
one might suppose for any true Liberal,
a State-controlled educational system is
on a par with a State-imposed morality
or a State-imposed religion (or anti-
religion).
In a Liberal society then I ought not
to be called on to justify my choos-
ing to send my children to a certain
kind of school any more than I ought
to be obliged to justify my right to
believe and say what I choose. In other
words, it ought to be sufficient for me
to say that my wife and I are both
Catholics and that we want our children
educated in a way that will be generally
in accordance with our beliefs our
“world view” as Catholics. Just as
other parents, whether they be Protes-
tants or Humanists or Communists, have
a right to educate their children in ac-
cordance with the dictates of their own
consciences, so have we as Catholics a
similar right. And that ought to be that.
Perhaps I ought to make it clear that
when I say that parents have a right to
educate their children in accordance
with their own beliefs, I do not mean
that there is a Catholic or Protestant or
Humanist or Communist “line” in
science, in literature, in history, etc., and
that the Catholic or Protestant or
Humanist or Communist carl ' cJeiUailQ
that education ought to be slanted ac-
cording to this “line”. There are, after
all, common standards of intellectual
objectivity that everyone must abide by
irrespective of his beliefs, and in this
sense there is no such thing as Catholic
or Protestant or Humanist or Commu-
nist education: there is only education
fullstop. But it remains true that the
whole way an educational system is
framed will inevitably be influenced by
the particular world-view of the framer.
For example, the topics that are selected
for study in any subject (the selection of
a particular period of history or a par-
ticular author, for instance, as being
more relevant or important than
another); the intellectual and moral and
social and aesthetic attitudes that are
held up, either deliberately or tacitly, to
the pupils for emulation; the order of
educational priorities established (whe-
ther, for instance, utilitarian subjects
are to be given preference over non-
utilitarian ones); the way in which reli-
gion is seen as bearing upon other sub-
jects (whether, for instance, it is seen as
a real and relevant part of the syllabus
or, on the other hand, as a dispensable
“extra-curricular” subject) all these
things will inevitably (and legitimately)
be influenced by the particular values
that one espouses.
Of course, the State educational system
pretends that it is neutral about ques-
tions of value and that State education
is for everyone, whatever their beliefs.
But that, as they say in the Bronx, is
strictly for the birds. Anyone who has
been educated in a State school or who
has taught in one (I have been and
done both) knows that State education
just as much reflects a particular set of
values and a particular (even if fuzzy)
world-view as, say, Catholic education.
And the parent who sends his child to


a State school implicitly chooses State
school education because it fits in gene-
rally, or at least does not conflict, with
his own tacit set of values.
I like to think, then, that in choosing
to send my children to a Catholic school
I am simply following J. S. Mill’s instruc-
tions and being a good little Liberal
doing my modest bit to encourage
“individuality” and “social diversity”
that Mill held was of the essence of
any truly free society. And, as I have
been saying, it seems to me that I have
a right to presume that this should be
taken for granted in a free society and
that the onus ought to be on anyone
who questions it.
But, of course, in Australia my right
to educate my children as I choose is
certainly not taken for granted, and in
fact all the onus is placed upon the
parent who chooses to send his child
to a non-State school. Of course you
are “free'’ to send your children to non-
State schools in that you are not physi-
cally prevented from doing so, but you
are at the same time severely penalised
for exercising your freedom in that the
State uses public money to support its
own educational system and denies it
to non-State schools. As the recent Vic-
torian ALP report on education disarm-
ingly puts it: “Citizens who do not
choose to use the school facilities pro-
vided by the State, whether for conscien-
tious or other reasons, shall have the
absolute right to develop an independent
system of schools at a recognised stand-
ard, provided they do so at their own
expense”. In other words, you have an
“absolute right” to choose to send your
children to non-State schools but you will
be penalised economically if you do so;
we are all equal, only those who choose
implicitly the particular set of values re-
flected in State education and who send
their children to State schools are more
equal than those who do not. What would
we think if the State, while claiming
that there was complete religious freedom
in Australia, should then set up a State
Church of its own (strictly non-denom-
inational of course) and give complete
financial support to it while refusing any
aid at all to other denominations?
I am quite sure that this whole view
of education I have ( d'a pres Mill) been
proposing will seem outlandish and un-
real to most people, for the Prussian-
style centralised and monolithic State
system prevailing in Australia for the
last one hundred years is assumed to be
a sacrosanct part of the Australian way
of life, as though it had been handed
down to Moses (or Parkes and Higin-
botham) by Jahweh Himself. This
simply shows that there is something
wrong with the Australian educational
context. To my mind the main educa-
tional reform needed in Australia is a
breaking of the monopolistic grip that
the State has over education, and the
decentralising of education by encoura-
ging non-State schools of all kinds. My
ideal is one where the State would en-
courage private schools set up by the
free initiative of groups of people with
common interests, religious or other-
wise, and where these schools would be
the norm schools run directly by the
State being seen as supplementary to
these latter. But this is still, alas, in
the realm of Utopia as far as Australia
is concerned.
It may seem paradoxical that in the
matter of education, Catholics, by
making a stand against what Mill calls
the “despotism” of State education,
should be almost the only ones in Aus-
tralia interested in Liberal values in
education. But, on second thoughts, is
it really so paradoxical after all?
“Not Just
Secular,
But Free ”
By ANN McCALLUM
Isend my children to a State school
because, where we live, the best and
closest school to us is one. I am
pleased about it, in the first place, be-
cause it costs less. I suppose we could
afford private education for all our
children if we had to, but it would mean
economising in all sorts of ways which
would be to their disadvantage no less
than to our own. “Free” education
can be quite a costly business; if to the
price of sporting equipment, text books
and uniforms were added tuition fees,
there would be little, if anything, left
over for drama, music, fencing or what-
ever. It would be a great pity for the
children not to be able to follow up
these interests, however transitory and
fleeting they might be.
My second reason is not really rea-
son but prejudice—the vestiges of an
old lofty sentimental belief that the best
education is available to everybody with
the mental equipment to make use of
it. Where we live this happens to be
true, but I know that it is not true every-
where and if I thought a private school
would be a help to my children, I
could overcome my prejudice. All the
same, it is more comfortable not to
have to do so.
I should say at this point that I think
it is a good thing if private schools are
many and varied. Those who wish their
children to be given religious instruction
as well as education must clearly look to
private schools for this, and I can see
no good reason why these schools should
not be given State aid, provided their edu-
cational standard is adequate. Again,
State schools are not the places to try
out exotic or cranky theories of educa-
tion, but any community's educational
system would be the poorer if there
were not private schools able and willing
to experiment. The more plentiful and
varied private schools there are, the
better: there is not likely to be any
danger of the State educational system
withering away because of too much
competition.
There is one set of reasons which I
don't consider particularly significant,
whether it is used in favor of State or
private education. I refer to all the non-
sense talked about meeting the right
sort of people, learning proper values
and all that. The right sort of people
arc likely to turn up at State or private
schools, and so are the wrong. It is
true that, by going to a private school,
one can avoid meeting people from de-
pressed and underprivileged areas; but
it is also true that, by going to a State
school, one can avoid meeting people
who think that the important things in
life can be bought, that the best educa-
tion is the most expensive, and that the
rich have more than money to set them
above their fellows. As for snobs, one
can find just as good specimens at a
State school as anywhere: “After all,”
the argument seems to go, “they can
buy their way into their schools; you
have to have brains to get into ours.''
Gone are the days, too, if indeed they
ever existed, when the State school con-
fined itself to teaching the curriculum
and left training in all those vague but
supposedly important character-building
qualities to private enterprise. The
round-up of annual speech day reports
seems to indicate that headmasters from
State schools have just as much to say
as those from private schools about
school loyalty, team spirit and service to
the community. At our school they
even seem to believe in the character-
building qualities of Rugby Union —
which is really, I think, carrying things
a bit far.
In fact, leaving “crank schools” aside,
the way in which State education differs
from private is that it is secular and
free. Some people might consider the
former a disadvantage, but who will
quarrel with the latter?

Throw the
Vegetables at Me
Don’t dissect the little flower, just smell it
By RICHARD HUGHES Jnr
The trouble with the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theatre (the
Sydney season closes at the Tivoli
Theatre on February 13; the Melbourne
season opens at the Comedy on Febru-
ary 16) is that it is too good. In an age
when “popular” music has sunk to an
all-time low, when dancing has been
reduced to a pathetic formula by child-
ish cretins who don't even know what
they’re dancing for, how can something
so obviously great and magnificent as the
Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre survive? Louis
Armstrong made the hit parade with
Hello Dolly and Sidney Bechet did with
Petite Fleur and A Moi D’Payer (and
what a pay-off that was there is at
least one reader who will understand),
but they were exceptions.
I must preface what I fear will be a
rambling personal yarn with the proud
admission that I am the pianist in two
sequences of Mr Ailey’s production—-
Been Here and Gone, and The Blues
Suite. Along with the superb Negro
singer Brother John Sellers, the inven-
tive American drummer George Neier-
dorf, the ever dependable bassist Harry
Tuckey and Tom Smith (surely Austra-
lia’s most underrated guitarist), I am
down in the pit. So if you don't like
the “live” music, throw the vegetables at
me, because my back is turned.
The singing of Brother John is larger
than life. Sidney Bechet, that great man
and titanic musician, first heard him in
Paris and said: “Man, I haven’t heard a
wailer like that since I was back in
New Orleans years ago. I have
always considered Leadbelly (Hudie
Ledbetter) one of the more intense
Negro folk and blues singers. Compared
with Brother John’s rendition of Bessie
Smith’s Backwater Blues, Leadbelly’s
sounds like a vicarage tea party. (“No
thank you; no sugar”.) Brother John is
not content with just singing the blues.
He is the blues.
The ballet is an art form for which
I have an ignorant indifference and I
wouldn’t dare try to explain the symbols
I see in the Road of the Phoebe Snow
(music by Duke Ellington and Bill
Strayhorn) and Revelations (traditional
Negro religious music) sequences. Don’t
dissect the little flower; just look at it
and smell. But I must try to put down
my reactions to Dark Was the Night in
the Been Here arKd Gone section which,
alas, may have been deleted from the
programme by the time this appears.
Brother John has his own version of
Dark Was the Night, which Blind Willie
Johnson first recorded in 1928. It is a
visual and aural interpretation of Christ’s
Agony in the Garden.
On second thoughts, I won’t put down
my reactions. Let me just cite Oscar
Wilde from the eleventh chapter of his
“Picture of Dorian Gray”, in which he
says of Gray's reaction to the Mass:
“The daily sacrifice, more awful really
than all the sacrifices of the antique
world, stirred him as much by its superb
rejection of the evidence of the senses
as by the primitive simplicity of its ele-
ments and the eternal pathos of the
human tragedy that it sought to symbo-
lise.”
James Truitte, William Louther,
Dudley Williams, Kelvin Rotardier and
Morton Winston sacrifice the at once
firm and fragile Loretta Abbott nightly.
The Blues Suite will certainly remain
in the show. The description of it in the
programme reads:
“From the fields and barrel-houses
of the southern Negro sprang the blues
songs of lost love, despair, protest
and anger hymns to the secular region
of the soul.”
The result on stage is an incredibly
accurate, sensitive and subtle visual por-
trayal of a music which most people still
haven’t begun to understand. We sweat
in the pit with Brother John, who in
turn sweats as he urges us on, his eye
following every movement on stage, his
fingers clicking to get us in a tempo
which may elude us, his voice sometimes
like a cross between Joe Turner’s and
Jimmy Rushing’s and Leroy Carr’s, some-
times going back to the sweet savagery
of Blind Blake, Blind Boy Fuller and
Blind Willie Johnson. This is when Tom,
Dick, Harry and George see something
new in the show every night, note a
symbol within a symbol, peer through
shadows of ladders and flashing limbs,
conjure up images of Vaehel Lindsay’s
“fat black bucks in a wine-barrel room”.
When the lamp descends for In the
Evening after the electric performance
by Hope Clarke and Alvin Ailey of
Backwater Blues, I remember what Ailey
told me about the wandering blues min-
strels who passed through his hometown
of Rogers, Texas, when he was a child.
“They were physically beautiful people
with troubled faces”, he said. “I identi-
fied myself with the fear and frustrations
they expressed in their songs. They had
beauty in their soul. They’d brawl and
fight on Saturday nights, but they’d all
be at church on Sunday morning. Those
Sunday church services made a lasting
impression on me. The sermons reeked
with images of fire and brimstone, but
there were as many gentle references to
white lilies in the fields.”
What are the first tunes Alvin Ailey
can remember hearing? “Well, probably

Trouble in Mind and See See Rider”
(he sings verses from both in The Blues
Suite) “and in church I first heard Amaz-
ing Grace and Brighten the Corner.”
Amazing Grace and Brighten the Corner?
The phrase could be a succinct and im-
pressionistic description of the Ailey
Dancers’ qualities.
How does Ailey describe the company
himself? “You can say it’s like a fine jazz
ensemble,” he said. “Each dancer is a
soloist with his own quality and at times
I get them to all play together.” I was
reminded of Duke Ellington’s description
of his own orchestra, which has been
the best big jazz ensemble for nearly 40
years. “You can’t write music unless you
know how the man that'll play it plays
poker. My band is my instrument, even
more than the piano.”
Except for Brother John, there are no
stars billed in the show. All are dance
teachers and all take it in turns to teach
the company for at least an hour before
the start of every performance. We
musicians and the stage-hands are all
astounded by their dedication, but
obviously you must be dedicated if you
have a message as noble as theirs.
A certain gracious lady recently inter-
viewed me on radio and, as I remember,
asked me if I thought the show’s mes-
sage was one of despair or triumph. It is
triumph, of course the triumph of an
oppressed people who want victory with-
out bloodshed and are confident of that
victory eventually. The blues does not
mean a maudlin torch song, does not
imply a wallow in self-pity. The music
is sad, usually, but there is always a hint
of hope in it.
Mr Ailey, who is one of those con-
stantly alert people who interviews you
when you interview him, had some pretty
penetrating comments to make about
Australians. “I see so many people here
walking in the streets and I can just tell
they’re holding something within them
all the time; they just shriek of intro-
version. I’m going to put on a new ballet
called Rooms and it could apply to so
many of them. What do people like this
do in their private rooms? What’s hold-
ing them back and weighing them down?”
Mr Ailey knows this ballet will be un-
popular, but he is determined to press
on with it. It may well be a finished
product when this article appears.
Mr Ailey, who was once going to be
a teacher of Romance Languages, has
translated the fears and frustrations of
his poor Negro childhood into a monu-
mental act of faith, hope and charity. In
this time of doubt, vacillation, despair
and inhumanity even in lands of hope
and glory and milk and honey like Aus-
tralia it should be compulsory view-
ing. The corner is bright with amazing
grace. The Alvin Ailey American Dance
Theatre could help a lot of people to
turn it with confidence.

The One
They Go For
"I can see them fancying me ”
By HUGH CUR NOW
Each of the obvious things about
Mick Jagger was apparent imme-
diately he bounced into the hotel
reception-room. The hair couldn’t have
been shaggier, the shirt stripier or the
shoes more pointed. And the pants
could hardly have been tighter. His
pallid, oblong face with contrastingly
blood-red lips completed the picture
that teenagers of the Western world
scream at. Looking exactly like a walk-
ing cut-out of himself from a TV fan
magazine, he crossed immediately to my
proffered chair near the wall and sat
with a grateful “Thanks, my darling”,
that had distinct overtones of Fagin
accepting a pocket-handkerchief from
Oliver Twist.
Much of the Rolling Stones’ public
carry-on has overtones of something
else. Part-Beatle, part blouson-noir,
part mod, and even part rocker, they
strut, mince, pout and perform with
noticeable arrogance and aplomb. The
end result—a sort of half-way house
between Burlesque Queens and the East
End Kids—combines with an amplified
sound of stridently-harmonised guitars,
voices and harmonicas that seems as
familiar as it is frenetic.
As leader of the five Rolling Stones,
Jagger denies any deliberate copying
but admits to the influence of “current
trends’’. Weary of being compared to
the better-known Beatles, insulted by
suggestions that he seems to be a fish-
and-chippy version of John Lennon, he
nonetheless continues to handle Press
conferences in the Lennon-spirit of slick
banter and to drink Lennon’s favor-
ite concoction of whisky-and-coke. “The
thing is,” he told me, “I knew John
Lennon and the other Beatles when.
Long before anyone had heard of them
Lennon and I were dose friends. We
still are. Our groups have similar
tastes and so do John and me. So who’s
copying who? We’ve both got some of
the same gimmicks, that’s all.”
Speaking with the aggressively work-
ing-class accents of his native Kent,
Jagger paused to sign autographs, one
of which was requested by a newspaper
reporter “for my ten-year-old son”.
Jagger began to relax as he scrawled his
signature 14 times, placing a double
“x” under each. “You know,” he said,
“I stopped asking people for autographs
when I was ten. I just can’t understand
what people get out of autographs. I
mean what is it but a scribble of ink?
But you’ve got to give them what they
want, I suppose, even if they are a bit
nutty.”
Press conferences bored him only be-
cause he found that usually they con-
sisted of reporters trying to show off
in front of each other, he said. “If only
they’d ask questions that really interest
them, not what they think their editors
want to know . . . like what do we eat and
what sort of clothes do we like and what
do we think of parents. I mean, how
stupid can you get? What the would
I know about other people’s parents? I’m
flat out understanding my own. No,
I don’t have to support my family like
that over-rated Cliff Richard. (Does he
give me a pain!) I reckon they never
gave me much money so why should I
now start dishing it out to them? I get
on well with my parents. I don't have
to buy their company.”
What does he think of the teenage
fans he has met since the Rolling Stones
began getting the scream-treatment?
‘That’s exactly two-and-a-half years, so
far. I reckon the ones I’ve met in that
time are an immature lot. All my
real friends are at least ten years older
than me. I can talk with them about
real things. People like Rudy Nureyev
whom I had supper with the other night.
They don’t just want to know why you
wear your hair so long or if you bath
regular. They want to know about me.
Sometimes I find I’m the one who

Business is good but it could be a lot better for
him if he could install new machinery. But he doesn’t
want to pay out ready cash.
His answer is to lease new machinery through
General Credits. They lay out the ready cash,
he pays a fixed monthly rental and deducts the
payments in full from his income tax.

doesn’t know what to say to them. I
remember asking Rudy how limited he
was when he was in Russia—stupid
things like that.”
Having been given a “genius” rating
of 140 in an IQ test when he was 11,
Jagger allowed his parents to enrol him
for an economics degree at the London
School of Economics when he was 17.
“I didn’t stay long enough to graduate.
I was more interested in making music
with the group. It was our manager,
Andrew Loog Oldham, who first got
us to go professional. (He’s younger
than me, by the way.) We’ve never
looked back but it won’t last. I know
you were hoping I'd say that—everyone
does. Anyway, it's true. I'd hate to
be singing in another five years, if it
comes to that. The day we fail to get
two successive records in the Top
Twenty I'll say ‘Orright, that’s it. Every-
body out!’ and we’ll go our own sweet,
darling ways.”
Now living at London’s Hampstead,
Jagger shares a flat with another Rolling
Stone, Brian Jones. “We’re the only two
who share a place. Charlie and Bill are
married and Keith’s a loney. I don’t
know why I'm the one that the fans
and the Press go for I don’t even know
if it’s me or just ‘the leader of the
Stones’ they’re after. But it doesn't mat-
ter any of it in the long run,
does it? Some egg-head interviewers
reckon our appearance is designed to
appeal equally to boys as to girls.
There’s probably something in that. I
know that the boys in the audience
fancy me. I can see them fancying me.
Then they go out and grow their hair
and dress like me. Isn't that stupid? I
mean, either you’re it or you’re not. I
just don’t like imitations.”
Just then he noticed a reporter nearby
taking notes, and the Jagger lips per-
ceptibly narrowed. “I don't like
eavesdroppers, either,” he hissed at him.
“Why don’t you ask me what you want
to know? Go on! I’ll tell you straight,
I will. We all use much more toilet water
than the Beatles AND deodorant,
too!”

Vatican’s Offensive
in Eastern Europe
Undermining Communist “churches ”
By EUGENE BAJKOWSKI
Obscured by the spectacular pro-
ceedings of the Second Council of
the Vatican and deliberately kept
out of the limelight, the Holy See’s quiet
diplomatic offensive in Eastern Europe is
gaining momentum. Last October the
Vatican signed an important agreement
with Hungary, the first official covenant
ever made by the Holy See with a Com-
munist-controlled State and the result of
patient probings and protracted negotia-
tions. Sporadic unofficial talks are go-
ing on between the Vatican's representa-
tives and the Czechoslovak regime of
President Novotny and Premier Lenart.
Meanwhile, bargaining on Cardinal Mind-
szenty's future is continuing with the
Kadar Government in Budapest. The
Holy See is also getting ready to tackle
the complex and delicate problem of its
relations with Gomulka in Warsaw.
All this emphasises the Vatican's new
policy in Central and Eastern Europe,
and its efforts to assert its influence as
a major factor in the political evolution
of what was once Moscow's decile “satel-
lite bloc’’.
The agreement with the Kadar regime
in Hungary marks the Vatican's first
major diplomatic breakthrough in the
“satellite bloc”.
Negotiated initially on the Holy See's
behalf by Cardinal Koenig—the Arch-
bishop of Vienna, Austria's Roman
Catholic Primate and a tough and ex-
perienced papal diplomat—and signed by
Msgr Casaroli, plenipotentiary of the
Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesi-
astical Affairs, this agreement established
a carefully defined modus vivendi be-
tween the Catholic Church and the Hun-
garian Communist State. The agreement
guarantees certain basic minimum rights
of the Hungarian hierarchy and puts on
record the first formal acknowledgement
by the Holy See of the Kadar regime as
Hungary's Government.
The Kadar Government has in effect
agreed to cease its attempts to dislodge
the Hungarian hierarchy by brute force,
administrative pressure—such as unila-
teral “unseating"’ of bishops, police raids
on provincial curias, etc. and open
attempts to subvert the clergy. It also
conceded the “legal right” of religious
instruction of children in “catechitic
centres”, although religion will not be
brought back into schools.
Kadar made other vital concessions.
He acknowledged the Holy See's exclu-
sive canonical jurisdiction over all Hun-
garian Catholics, conceded to the
hierarchy the hotly disputed right of
“publishing and disseminating religious
information within the established legal
framework” and agreed to quietly dis-
solve a number of Communist-run,
spurious “Catholic” organisations headed
by “progressive Catholics” and “patriot
priests".
The first means simply that the Vati-
can alone can appoint bishops and apos-
tolic administrators and make any other
ecclesiastical appointments in Hungary.
The Budapest Government is precluded
from “withdrawing recognition”, “re-
moving", "isolating” or otherwise inter-
fering with Hungarian prelates or their
subordinates.
“Publishing and disseminating religi-
ous information" in practice means not
only printing catechisms, prayer books or
holy pictures but also publishing a
limited number of Catholic periodicals.
Genuinely Catholic publications will,
of course, stiil be subject to strict and
hostile censorship. But at least they will
not print what the hierarchy does not

wish them to print (e.g., Communist
“peace” propaganda) and will be edited
by people close to the hierarchy and not
by Communist “front” groups staffed
by “patriot priests”, “peace priests” and
other fellow-travellers. This is an im-
portant difference in Communist-con-
trolled countries, where the Catholic
masses are sometimes tricked by the
“ultra-Catholic” appearance and numer-
ous pictures of saints and popes, which
are a speciality of Communist-sponsored
“front” publications. The return of
“Tygodnik Powszechny”, “Wiez” and
“Przewodnik Katolicki” to Cardinal
Wyszynski’s control in Poland in 1956
was a shattering blow to the fellow-
travelling “PAX” and “Social Christian”
publications. The same thing should
now happen in Hungary.
Disowning the Communist-sponsored
“front” groups is a corollary of the first
two concessions. The “patriot priests”
and their lay counterparts have outlived
their usefulness. Even at the height of
Rakoszy’s terror their practical value was
doubtful. They made a lot of noise and
had some propaganda value abroad. But
their primary aim of corroding the hier-
archy’s structure from within and crea-
ting a real split between the upper and
lower clergy, a sort of “class war within
the Church”, was never achieved. In
fact, these “front” groups merely helped
to expose and isolate unreliable priests.
Once identified, the “patriot priests” were
unfrocked, excommunicated or suspend-
ed. Their present plight is well illustra-
ted by the fact that Kadar had to bargain
hard to get the Vatican to lift “most
ecclesiastical sanctions against priests who
collaborated with the Government”. In
return Kadar had to agree to withdraw
his “audit inspectors” from diocesan
administrative centres. When it came to
hard bargaining, the “front” groups
proved to be a liability rather than an
asset to their sponsors.
Cardinal Mindszenty
TT'adar’s Government agreed to continue
paying State salaries to officiating
bishops and priests, as well as pensions
to aged clergymen. It also undertook to
provide sufficient funds and building
materials for new church buildings, reno-
vate historic churches and pay for the
training of a limited number of Hun-
garian theological students in Rome.
The Vatican almost immediately
appointed six new bishops to vacant
Hungarian sees and indicated that it may
also appoint a number of “suffragan”
(assistant) bishops.
What did Kadar get in return?
At first glance, he came off second
best. True, the Vatican formally acknow-
ledged the fact that Communists rule
Hungary and permitted Catholic bishops
and priests to take an oath of allegiance
to the “Hungarian People’s Republic”.
The Hungarian Institute in Rome was
handed over to the jurisdiction of the
Hungarian hierarchy, restoring the pre-
war status quo. Its students and staff
must now be Hungarian or Vatican
citizens. Formally, this removes the
Institute from the control of anti-Com-
munist (and militant) emigre priests.
The Mindszenty affair was temporarily
shelved after bitter deadlocks and its
solution carried over to further talks.
Thus Kadar avoided an outright loss of
face. But Cardinal Mindszenty still re-
mains Prince Primate of Hungary and
his presence in the US Fegation in Buda-
pest continues to be a constant source
of embarrassment to Kadar's Govern-
ment, hopeful of improving its relations
with the United States.
But for his part, Kadar is obviously
also satisfied. The agreement gave him
important prestige in Hungary, making
his Government appear more “respect-
able”. It increased his personal influ-
ence in the Communist East European
bloc, established a truce with the once
bitterly hostile Hungarian hierarchy and
helped his efforts to create an impres-
sion of a “moderate” and “reasonable”
leader in the West.
For a man responsible for betraying
and drowning in blood the Hungarian
Revolution in 1956, the brutal reprisals
of 1957 and the treacherous murder of
Premier Nagy and General Maleter, this
is a considerable achievement. From

being the most notorious of the Krem-
lin's henchmen in 1956-57, Kadar is
rapidly becoming the most “liberal” and
independent of all satellite leaders.
Bolstered by his largely successful
efforts to woo the population by econo-
mic and political concessions—and rela-
tively minor but continuous sops thrown
to the restive intellectuals, who are now
probably better off than any of their
counterparts in Eastern Europe—Kadar
is using his deal with the Vatican to
strengthen his personal position as Hun-
gary’s boss.
Kadar lost no time in hinting to the
Kremlin's new B and K team that his
Vatican deal would make attempts to
sack him, or encourage his rivals in Hun-
gary, difficult and unwise.
The Vatican, on the other hand, has
established itself firmly and officially in
an important part of the “satellite bloc”.
Its determined diplomatic offensive in
Eastern Europe is becoming an impor-
tant fadtor in the slow and painful evolu-
tion of the “satellite bloc” into a sort of
Communist “third force”, oscillating be-
tween Moscow and Peking and gradu-
ally becoming more sovereign politically
and economically, though not necessarily
always more liberal in domestic affairs.
The Vatican may eventually become
a unique additional centre to which
Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and
perhaps even the predominantly Ortho-
dox Rumania—could look to for unoffi-
cial but valuable support in crucial
moments, thus increasing the degree of
oscillations and accelerating the process
of disintegration of the Communist
camp.
Hungary was the ideal place to start.
There were no problems of altered post-
war frontiers and the Hungarian Revo-
lution, though it failed, released powerful
forces which Kadar can hold back only
by gradual “Westernisation”.
Unfrocked
/Czechoslovakia will be more difficult
Novotny’s regime may be tottering
but, despite many learned predictions by
Western “Kremlinologists”, he has man-
aged to remain both the President (in
Czechoslovakia this is not a titular post
but a position of real power) and the
Communist Party boss.
After being forced to sack Siroky as
Premier and install Lenart in his place
late in 1963, Novotny introduced a more
realistic economic policy but has fought
fiercely to retain his dominant position.
He may well prove to be a more diffi-
cult negotiator than Kadar. Also, the
Catholic hierarchy in Czechoslovakia is
weaker than in either Hungary or Poland.
Premier Lenart, a Slovak, is known to
be keen to arrive at some modus vivendi
with the hierarchy. One of his first acts
after becoming Premier in September,
1963, was to release Prague's Archbishop
Beran from imprisonment and “pardon”
some other Czech and Slovak prelates.
Oddly enough, one of his cabinet
ministers is Dr Plojchar, an unfrocked
Catholic priest who stubbornly continues
to dress as a cleric, affects “saying Mass”
and styles himself as “Father Joseph”.
In Poland the situation is even more
complex and difficult. The Polish hier-
archy is well entrenched, conscious of its
powerful influence, used to the Church's
traditional and dominant role in the
nation’s affairs.
Cardinal Wyszynski's predecessors (and
he himself) signed formal agreements
with the Communist regime in 1946,
1950 and 1956-57.
Some of these agreements worked and
some failed, but by and large the Polish
prelates have long maintained the posi-

tion only now gained by the Hungarian
hierarchy. In Poland the Catholic hier-
archy is, in effect, a “co-ruler” of the
“People’s Republic”, a hostile “working
partner” of the Gomulka Government.
It is not a docile band of frightened
priests, and it fights intelligently, con-
stantly and fiercely to maintain and
spread its political influence. The struggle
is not so much to keep the churches open
as to resist the secularisation of Polish
society and keep in check materialistic
philosophy.
The situation is complicated by prob-
lems of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, result-
ing from the westward shift of Poland’s
postwar frontiers.
A Concordat?
A number of Polish dioceses were lost
east of the new frontier on the Bug.
In the west and north-east the Polish
hierarchy took over several dioceses
which were largely Germanised after
Poland was partitioned in the 18th cen-
tury. Some of these dioceses reverted
to Poland in 1918, others not until 1945.
The prewar Concordat with the Vatican
was repudiated by Warsaw in 1945 and
subsequent agreements between the hier-
archy and the Government cannot fully
replace it.
Since April, 1945, the Polish hierarchy
has efficiently administered all the dio-
ceses within the country’s existing fron-
tiers. It went through the difficult years
of the Stalinist regime with flying colors
and today has the strongest administra-
tive network of any church in Eastern
Europe. But several technical points
must still be settled, and they can only
be settled by the Vatican.
For many years after the war the Vati-
can did little to normalise the technical
position of a number of Polish dioceses.
This provided the Communists with
ammunition to attack the hierarchy as
“unpatriotic”. After Gomulka took over
in 1956, bishops were appointed to all
vacant sees in Poland. In March this
year the Vatican took the next step by
appointing Bishop Nowicki both the titu-
lar and ruling Bishop of Gdansk.
Because of the strong position of the
Polish hierarchy, Gomulka has few easy
concessions to offer in return for a Con-
cordat for which he has been angling
since 1958. On the other hand, direct
negotiations with the Vatican and even
a Concordat could weaken the actual
position of Cardinal Wyszynski and his
bishops, giving Gomulka a means to
reach over their heads.
Talks with Gomulka can be only for
big stakes and both Warsaw and the
Vatican would have to make major, often
dramatic, concessions to get anywhere.

Peking’s Deal
With Djakarta
Unloading Red China’s shoddies
By EMERY BARCS
Indonesian Prime Minister Dr
Subandrio’s visit to Peking for dis-
cussions on military and economic
assistance from Red China reminds one
of the rather coarse Central European
peasant saying that a marriage between
two beggars doesn’t make a couple of
millionaires.
The Chinese may be able to deliver
some ammunition and spares to the
Indonesian armed forces should the
Soviet Union be reluctant to do so. Yet
Nationalist Chinese and American intel-
ligence reports seem to agree that while
Red China has managed to produce a
nuclear-bomb it has so far failed to
establish an industry for more sophisti-
cated weaponry, including aeroplanes.
Hence Peking’s support of the military
side of konfrontasi would be strictly
limited to what is available, which is not
too impressive.
Even less striking is the Red Chinese
capacity for bolstering Indonesia’s
depleted and rundown economy for
the simple reason that while the Chinese
economy has now partly recovered from
the catastrophic consequences of the
Great Leap Forward between 1959 and
1961, it is still a rather emaciated paper-
tiger.
Red China’s economic development
depends upon four factors: (a) increase
of agricultural production, (b) control
of population growth, (c) industrial pro-
gress and (d) foreign economic and tech-
nical aid. So far the struggle to over-
come the difficulties in these four
groups of problems is still in its initial
stage.
Last year grain production probably
reached the 1957 level of between ISO-
-185 million tons after a catastrophic fall
to probably less than 145 million tons
in 1960 and 1961. Yet Red China must
still import about 5,000,000 tons of
Western wheat and barley annually and
pay scarce hard currencies for it.
Since 1957, however, mainland
China’s population has increased at a
rate of between two and three per
cent a year. Taking even the lower figure
the population growth would amount
to more than 90 million people during
the past seven years with no addi-
tion to the country’s never over-abund-
ant food supplies. The Malthusian
threat explains why Peking, after con-
siderable hesitation, has decided for
birth-control. Party indoctrinators now
preach that a two-child family is the
Communist optimum, a three-child fam-
ily is the maximum and four children
reveal grave irresponsibility.
Industrial output, which developed
fast during 1958-1960, declined sharply
during the following two years and took
a mildly upward course again in 1963
and 1964. As a result of the agricul-
tural catastrophe China had to cut
sharply its imports of machinery, indus-
trial fuels and raw materials. Between
1958-60 the annua] average spent on
these imports \vas £9OO million; during
the past four years it was probably no
more than £3OO million. Late last year
the Chinese Government admitted
(quoted by the veteran French China
correspondent, Robert Guillain) that the
country needed a million tractors but
had only 70,000; at a low estimate
400,000 trucks were urgently demanded
by industry but hardly one-third of
them was available and that less than
10 per cent of the necessary 40 mil-
lion tons of artificial fertilisers is being
produced annually.
Red China is also desperately short
of scientific and technological know-
how. Last year Chinese economic lead-
ers in Peking told the editor of the
Far Eastern Economic Review that the
great difficulties caused by the with-
drawal of 1390 Russian technicians
from Red China in 1960 has still not
been overcome.
How, then, has Peking managed to
repay the Soviets £694.5 million of a
total debt of £703 million within five
years leaving a mere £8.5 million for
1965, after which Red China will have
a net balance of payments with the
Soviet Union, provided Moscow is still
willing to buy goods from Peking.
The explanation is that the Soviet
Union has bought from Red China
cheap textiles, minerals and consumer
goods to the tune of £9O million a year.
But Russia, which is steadily increasing
its own output of consumer goods (in-
cluding textiles) and is improving their
quality, is unlikely to buy the Red
Chinese products after the debts had
been paid. And the chances of other out-
lets for Red Chinese shoddies are not
encouraging.
These are the goods which Red China
will probably unload on Indonesia in the
form of economic assistance. Not a bad
scheme if one can get away with it . . .

Keep the Club Fires Burning
HThe worst social problem of the late
A 1960 s in New South Wales was the
tragedy of the broken club. Looking
back after a decade one can see that the
trouble had its origin around Christmas,
1964, when the so-called Sydney Syndi-
cate demonstrated the first CJ (con-
trolled jackpot) technique. The method
employed was crude by comparison with
later developments, and very limited in
its effectiveness. But it showed that
the machines could be beaten.
The catastrophic downhill move in
club finances began two years later when
Sigmund Swotnich, a New Australian
physics student, introduced the first
electronic CJ system.
At first there were only slight symp-
toms of the decline in club amenities.
The St George Leagues Club cancelled
an order for a set of Gobelin tapestries
for its TV lounge. The Darlinghurst
RSL Club disposed of part of its art
collection (a Cezanne brought £52,000).
The Millers Point Social Club decided
not to replace a broken Waterford glass
chandelier.
Then conditions deteriora-
ted more rapidly. Bare patches
appeared in the deep wall-to-
wall carpets; the price of
chicken dinners rose; big
names like Frank Sinatra and
Joan Sutherland were dropped
from the floor shows. The transfer fees
paid for footballers dwindled, and lead-
ing players began to give up the game.
The last phase was so wretched that
even today former members prefer not
to talk about it. The bleak club pre-
mises, stripped of all luxuries, were no
pleasanter to drink in than hotels. Con-
fronted with steep rises in subscription
rates, people simply stayed away.
Dr G. McNutt, Macquarie Street
psychiatrist, gives a vivid picture of the
demoralisation that followed. “Thous-
ands of former club members suddenly
found themselves without leisure inter-
ests or any outlet for their conative
drives,” he says. “Aimless and dis-
oriented, they wandered the streets after
work, looking for something to do and
talking about old times. Middle-aged
delinquency figures rose sharply. Some
men drank in hotels, breaking down and
weeping unashamedly as they recalled
their lost club amenities.”
It was the Rev. Norman Biggs, well-
known Sydney social worker, who
awakened the community to the plight
of the clubless and first showed a way
towards rehabilitation. He urged for-
mer members, as an experiment, to try
spending a few evenings at home. A
famous slogan outside his church said:
“Your home can be a club away from
club.”
Mr Biggs told me: “Ex-clubmen often
found that the conditions at home, al-
though far from ideal, were better than
they had been led to believe. Of course,
it was hard for some of them. A man
came to me, soon after he had started
going home, and told me he found his
wife’s company at night intolerably
boring. I said to him: ‘There were
bores at your club too —but did you
stay away for that reason?’ He agreed
to make an effort. A year later that
man told me he had learned to put up
with his wife, and had made some firm
friends among other members of the
family.”
Men who lived through that difficult
time recall many problems of adjust-
ment. Mr Nev Hobwell said to me:
“When I began going home at night,
what struck me most forcibly was the
lack of amenities. Some of the rooms
had no carpets. There was no
billiards table. The ice-cubes
were old-fashioned. At the
club we used to have an im-
ported machine that made ice-
cubes with a hole in the
middle for a straw.
“The food at home was uninteresting
too —no whiting caprice or steak Diane.
I complained to my wife, and she just
said: ‘Why don’t you kick in more
housekeeping money?’ Still, the service
was not bad, and she looked smart in
the white stewardess’ uniform I got for
her. At night you could always watch
TV.”
In some houses children caused em-
barrassment by asking: “Why does Dad
come home now, Mum?” But gradu-
ally they came to accept it as normal.
Men still missed the clatter of the
machines, especially on Saturday nights.
Sometimes they sang nostalgic songs
like Club, Sweet Club, and My Old
Kentucky Club. But to their credit
they did not waste time grieving for the
past; they set gamely about the hard
task of making something of home
life. With Australian resourcefulness
they would set up a bar in the living-
room, run a Cup sweep for the family,
and encourage the children to provide
floor-shows. Today many a citizen can
point proudly to a once forlorn little
home that has all the comforts of a club.

Cutting Jet Fares in Half
By ANDREW WILSON
Dramatic developments in America
promise to transform jet travel for
everyone.
By the early 1970 s as a result of
America’s decision to build a giant mili-
tary transport known as the Heavy Logis-
tics System (HLS), aeroplanes^will be
flying with 700 passengers.
Appropriations have been earmarked
for 62 of these giant subsonic jets which
will certainly give rise to a civil passenger
version. But its impact could be enor-
mous. Its relatively low cost and opera-
ting economy could cause the post-
ponement of the supersonic transport to
another decade. It could transform strate-
gic planning by cutting the need for over-
seas garrisons. Above all, it could make
possible a drastic cut in fares.
Three big companies have submitted
designs for an HLS to the United States
Government. Two of them, Boeing and
Douglas, are considering 500-seat civil
versions of the giant transport. The third,
Lockheed, said it was working on a
design which would carry about 700. It
would be a “multi-deck” airliner and
would cut present fares by up to a third.
“If an order is placed this summer,”
said one British aviation expert, “the
first military prototype can be flying by
1968, and 100 or so civil aircraft by
1972.”
A leading British aviation consultant,
Mr Richard Worcester, said he thought
the Lockheed estimate of a one-third cut
in fares was “pretty conservative”. From
a study of the inter-action between fare
cuts and traffic increase in the US, he
believed that a “civil HLS” could cut
fares by a half.
He believed that such a fare cut could
lead to up to a fivefold increase in
domestic and international passenger
traffic, (ofns)
MEDICINE
Bedwetting
By Dr ABRAHAM MARCUS
An electric buzzer alarm is recom-
mended as the best treatment for
bedwetting in children by “Drug
and Therapeutics Bulletin”, published
for doctors by the Consumers’ Associa-
tion. Two metal conductor pads in the
child's bed are separated by a cotton
sheet, another sheet covers them and
a waterproof sheet goes underneath. As
little as a thimbleful of urine completes
the circuit and the alarm rings.
Urination stops even before the child
is fully awake and there is only a small
wet patch instead of a soaked bed. The
child then gets up, turns off the alarm.
At five years old, about 15 per cent
of boys and 10 per cent of girls wet
their beds. About five per cent of all
nine-year-olds still wet their beds. If
the child is over five and has never
been dry, delayed maturity of the ner-
vous system is a likely cause, and the
buzzer is worth trying.
The response to the alarm is uncon-
scious. It seems to strengthen an inhi-
bitory reflex and repetition trains the
child to keep dry.
“This mechanical approach to treat-
ment has scandalised some people,” says
the bulletin, “but the objectors have
produced no evidence that the treatment
is harmful.” Six firms make the alarms
for from £E6 10s. to £E9 10s. (ofns)

The Nuns Story
SlR.—Whatever the opportunities for
nuns in Australia today to exercise Chris-
tian humility, patience, forbearance and
charity, there are times when, in the
interests of charity, one must cease to
forbear in humble patience. Indeed it is
charity to do so, not so much charity to
one’s 13,469 sisters, as to all the people
who find us so interesting as to put us
on the cover of The Bulletin (Jan.
23) and to read a feature story on us,
but who also find it so evidently difficult
to understand what our life is all about.
May I suggest that a nun’s life is not
really about what kind of bathing cos-
tume she wears, whether she drives a
car, or what she watches on TV. As
your writer says truly, “A nun's life is
explicable only in terms of her vocation”.
As I see it, the terms of this vocation
have meaning only in terms of a belief
in God, and this introduces a new dimen-
sion of thought and experience into her
life. To attempt to understand this life
and to fail to perceive this dimension is
to miss the whole point. In the first place,
then, the nun believes in God and she
believes that all fulfilment and happiness
is to be found in Him, and so she gives
up everything she may own (in the vow
of poverty), her right to marriage and
children (in the vow of chastity), her
right to manage her life for herself,
leaving that, through the vow of
obedience, to her Superiors whom she
sees as manifesting God's Will. But in
God she finds all mankind whom she
loves, so that it becomes her life to bring
Christ to them and them to Him.
True, to the outside observer, this may
seem remote from most convents which
are going concerns with ambitious pro-
grammes for expansion, but how many
have felt the sense of Something Other
which drives the nurse who is also a nun
to give so much more than she need to
her patients, which keeps the teaching
nun at the almost impossible task of
teaching the too-large class in the over-
crowded classroom. The centre of gravity
of a nun's life is, by definition, unseen;
the dedication of herself in love to God,
Whom she sees as Love.
It is said that nuns take little effective
part in the world, but it is good to think
about the word “effective”. It is true that,
today, we often equate this with getting
things done in the material sphere —-
building hospitals and schools, managing
large concerns, producing a favorable
balance sheet (though, even here, nuns
might score higher than one would
think). However, the nun would claim
that the kind of effectiveness that matters
for her is an effectiveness in non-material
matters: letting children feel that they
and their problems matter and have
value, giving adults understanding and a
sense that there is someone who wants
to help without asking anything back,
and, finally, witnessing to the possibility
of living for others as if God really did
matter. If love, if faith, is not effective in
ultimate terms, what is?
Thus, problems of adapting nuns’ lives
to the modern world have perhaps been
overstressed. If, essentially, the nun is to
witness to her belief in the “Wholly
Other”, then driving cars, discussing pet-
ting with teenagers and so on are of
value only as means to this end. The
habit matters far less than the person,
and her love for God increasingly should
make her a person who loves her fellow
human beings. People matter more than
machines and techniques. Is it, perhaps,
a measure of something wrong with our
society that we should find it so difficult
to understand the nun’s life because it is
based on the acceptance of the mystery
of God's love for men?

“Runaway"
SIR—I have just returned after a long
absence overseas and have only now
seen the New Zealand film “Runaway”,
so adversely described by your New
Zealand correspondent Maurice Shad-
bolt in your issue of November 14.
Shadbolt’s Newsletter about the film
misleads your readers by employing
cliches. Had he stopped to think
rather than rushed to write, he would
have noticed that the film is a slow
moving allegory—a tale about a lonely
soul’s blunders —a progress from silly,
non-motivated blunder (how much like
the things we do in all our lives!) to a
yet sillier blunder. Until, in the end
the young hero—or might we not con-
sider him an anti-hero?—goes off to-
wards the icy and lonely glaciers of his
own soul.

Decimal Coins
SlR.—Your reader R. W. Parry (8.,
Jan. 23) complains of the fact that there
is no direct decimal coin equivalent of
fourpence. Seeing that the disparity is
only a little greater than a farthing an
amount so insignificant that there is not
even a copper coin for it any more
this is surely a triviality. This and other
criticisms made of the decimal currency
we are to have seem to ignore the princi-
pal fact: that after nearly two hundred
years of pounds, shillings and nonsense
we are going to count our money the
same way, we count everything else. And
it won't come a moment too soon.

to B. F. Jones (8., Jan. 16) for his gal-

moments were spent feeding them and
contemplating their many attributes.
Splendid creatures, so down to earth! So

been an out-group so long in the eyes
of men. Some of my best friends are

FORUM
Six Ways to Reform
New Guinea
Otherwise, hell to pay
By SIBNARAYAN RAY
(Head of Department of Indian Studies,- University of Melbourne)
A paternalistic administra-
tion caught between Canberra’s
indecision or red tape and the
winds of change in the Territory; an
expatriate minority accustomed to privi-
leges but now feeling uncertain and in-
secure about its future; an indigenous
leadership moderately inclined but under
pressure of forces which may not
prove amenable to moderation; a sad
and confused people suddenly catapulted
by history from primitive tribalism to
the strenuous beginnings of modern
nationhood—these are some of the
rather disheartening first impressions
of Papua and New Guinea gathered
from the recent seminar at Port Moresby
organised by the Australian Association
for Cultural Freedom.
On a closer view, however, one noticed
several silver linings. The Administration
might occasionally bully and bluster, but
at the seminar not a few among its top
representatives gave hopeful signs that
their democratic habits and attitudes as
dinkum Aussies had not been altogether
corrupted by colonial functions and
powers. They argued and debated with
their critics on free and equal terms;
some almost openly admitted Canberra’s
lack of foresight and policy. More signi-
ficant, several leading expatriates seemed
to feel closer to indigenous aspirations
and perplexities than to Australia’s half-
hearted semi-colonial interests.
Putting all these together, it did not
seem improbable that Papua and New
Guinea’s transition to independence may
be more smooth and peaceful than has
been the experience of many Afro-Asian
countries; and that when eventually this
does take place, the new State may
expect to find in Australia not a sullen
neighbor but one genuinely anxious to
help.
But the most hopeful feature brought
out by the seminar was the presence of
a nucleus of indigenous leadership, w'hich
though inevitably very small at the
moment, nevertheless impressed everyone
by its qualities of political pragmatism,
quiet earnestness, and dedication to
national development. At the beginning
of the seminar these leaders seemed
rather diffident and uncommunicative.
But as the discussions progressed, they
became increasingly articulate, and at
the end there could be little doubt that
they were not only the acknowledged
spokesmen of their people but that
they fully knew what they were talking
about. There was little rhetoric and no
vagueness in their criticisms and pro-
posals. If they lacked somewhat in
political sophistication, they certainly
did not appear to be wanting in sturdy
common sense and personal integrity.
The most attractive of these indigenous
leaders at the seminar was Lepani Wat-
son, member of the new House of As-
sembly, who presented the opening paper
on “Papuan and New Guinean Reactions
to Local Government and the National
Election". Self-educated, soft-spoken and
physically inconspicuous, he nevertheless
seemed to be a person who unobtrusively
commands respect and trust in any com-
pany. Briefly but persuasively he pleaded
for more education, opportunities, cen-
tral planning. Another very impressive
participant was John Guise, the elected
leader of the unofficial members of the
House, who wanted the Papuans and
New Guineans to be given a real share
in the decision-making process and pro-
posed the appointment of a committee
to evolve a constitution for his country.
Among other indigenous participants
with a potential for national leadership
were Dirona Abe, Mathias Toliman,
Paulias To Nguna (who presented a
highly critical paper on “Education and
Employment"), Albert Maori Kiki, and
Oala Oala-Rarua (who also presented a
forceful paper criticising racial discri-
mination in public service).
A country which has already produced
leaders of this type in such a short time
and with so few opportunities has good
reasons to look confidently to its future.
However, the problems that face Papua
and New Guinea are complex and enor-
mous, and they have not been made
easier by Australia’s faults of both omis-
sion and commission. Some of these were
thrown into sharp relief by the seminar.
Without a clear target date for transfer
of power, there is little urgency in pre-
paring the people for the eventual as-
sumption of full responsibility. It was
pointed out by one speaker after an-
other that the Native Local Government
Councils depended heavily on Govern-
ment advice and supervision and pro-
vided little participation in the political
process; that the new House of Assem-
bly had hardly any real functions
and powers; that the indigenous under-
secretaries in the departments had no
share in decision-making. Almost no-
thing has been done to train adequately
an indigenous elite; genuine tertiary
education remains to date utterly
neglected. Nor has there been any
serious effort to promote indigenous
participation in economic development.
If not in law, in actual practice there was
gross discrimination in every field on
racial lines.
The issue of discrimination has recently
been highlighted by the new Public
Service Ordinance which came into effect
in September, 1964. Under this, salaries
of indigenous Government employees
were made less than half the basic rates
paid to Australian employees in the same
positions. Private firms are now planning
to adopt the same iniquitous policy and
reduce the salaries of their native em-
ployees by more than fifty per cent.
Papuan and New Guinean leaders
recognise that the limited resources of
their country would not for a long time
to come permit Australian scales of
wages and salaries. They, however, legiti-
mately resent that the House of Assembly
was not taken into confidence before Can-
berra took such an extraordinary decis-
ion. Besides, the more sensible policy
would have been to have one uniform
public service with a realistic scale of
pay dictated by the local economy;
expatriate officers might then be paid a
special allowance over and above the
basic salary provided there was a clear
policy to replace them by qualified
indigenous officers within a specified
period of time.
/\ne of the positive results of the semi-
nar was to underline the consensus
among indigenous leaders regarding the
immediate steps in preparation for inde-
pendence. In the first place, a definite
date must be announced for complete

transfer of power. Secondly, the House
of Assembly must become a real parlia-
ment; in other words, the true source
of policy-making. It should appoint a
committee to prepare the future consti-
tution of the country. Thirdly, the indi-
genous undersecretaries must have an
effective share in administration. Fourth-
ly, the Territory must immediately
establish a university and develop a full-
fledged system of tertiary education.
Primary education should not be neglec-
ted, but top priority must be given to
develop a sizeable national elite qualified
to assume the complex responsibilities
and functions of a modern democratic
State. Fifthly, an overall plan for
balanced economic development must
be drawn up with the help of inter-
national experts and international
assistance. Sixthly, all forms of racial
discrimination must be eliminated as
early as possible, and the people of
the country must be provided with in-
creasing opportunities for participation in
the country’s development.
To most of the participants from Aus-
tralia these demands appeared to be
timely, realistic and highly legitimate.
The decisive question is whether Can-
berra would have the wisdom to think
so and act accordingly. At the moment
the recognised leadership of Papua and
New Guinea does not seem to be ideo-
logically oriented; its nationalism is
moderate and practical and is based on
a realistic appreciation that the country’s
peaceful development depends largely on
Australian goodwill and co-operation.
However, should Canberra prove to be
unresponsive or, as it currently is, tardy
and hesitant in its policy of decolonisa-
ation by consent, the situation may radi-
cally change for the worse. There were
some ominous signs of this possibility
both in the seminar and outside.
Some of the young students of Papuan
Medical College and Administrative
College are particularly restive and bitter.
One of them, Dr Homo Batton, was
powerfully articulate in his angry critic-
ism of Australian policy or lack of policy.
He is active in the student movement,
has already composed a national anthem
and a national flag, and is canvassing the
name “Paradisia” for this country. An-
other young leader to watch is Albert
Maori Kiki, a student at the Administra-
tive College, who is vehemently critical
of the imposition of the Australian
political system which he thinks is alto-
gether unsuited to the traditions and
requirements of Papua and New Guinea.
Time is running short; and if Papua
and New Guinea eventually goes the
tragic way of the Congo or Indonesia,
the blame will lie fully and squarely
with Canberra. And then, heaven forbid,
Australia will really have hell to pay.

THE JACARANDA PRESS
NZ’s Polynesian Empire
Asian migrants but no Southern Europeans?
From MAURICE SHADBOLT in Auckland
New Zealanders who have long
taken it for granted that their
country lags behind Australia in
immigration received a shock recently.
They learned from the horse’s mouth—
Minister for Immigration Tom Shand—
that New Zealand has often had, in pro-
portion to population, a higher annual
intake of immigrants than Australia.
The point is, apparently, that the
bulk of the country’s immigration is on
a quiet personal scale. More than 80
per cent of immigrants arrive here under
their own steam.
These facts have for the time being
silenced Government critics in the busi-
ness community who have urged massive
immigration, Australian-style, as a solu-
tion to the country’s problems—particu-
larly the problem of over-full employ-
ment. These critics have constantly
pointed to the Australian figures for
assisted immigration, and ignored all
else.
But after answering critics, Minister
Shand had another point to make. A
greater rate of immigration could, he
said, aggravate New Zealand's infla-
tionary problems rather than assist them.
If agricultural production accounts for
97 per cent of the country’s export in-
come, then it is apparent that immi-
grants—who arrive in the cities and
stay there—are consumers rather than
producers; larger urban concentrations
quite simply mean less butter, cheese,
wool and meat for export.
The fact that immigration is the right
answer for Australia, with its great
potential, does not mean that it is the
right answer for this country. As the
“Auckland Star” recently pointed out,
over-full employment here could be
ended within months if the Govern-
ment were ruthless enough in weeding
out “sick” industries whose products
would be better replaced by imported
goods. New Zealand is not so much
short on population numbers as on truly
productive skills.
And this was the argument of one
recent Government critic prominent in
the business community, who suggested
the country would do better to encour-
age the immigration of skilled Asians
rather than unskilled Europeans.
The suggestion might not have the
impact here that it would have in Aus-
tralia—yet it is true that, so far as Asia
is concerned, New Zealand's immigra-
tion policy is as white as White Aus-
tralia’s. And as far as Europe is con-
cerned, it is even whiter —no olive-
skinned Italians are allowed here, even
if they pay their own way, and only a
spare sprinkling of Greeks; assisted
immigration has been strictly for pale
North Europeans.
The only colored people allowed entry
have been the natives of Pacific islands
where New Zealand has, or has had,
special responsibility. Despite their
recently-won independence the people of
rapidly overcrowding Western Samoa,
for example, are free to move here.
On the other hand, Tongans are not
allowed to settle here without difficulty
—though population pressure is already
severe in Tonga, and though their
Queen Salote has an Auckland residence.
Nor are Fijians. This has been high-
lighted spectacularly in recent months
with the deportation of Fijian Indians
who seek, in growing numbers, to settle
in New Zealand.
Some Fijians—in seeking a way out
of their territory’s racial dilemma—have
suggested the answer might be eventual
union with New Zealand. This is more
than logical. At the present stage in the
development of the South Pacific, it
seems inevitable. The question is
whether New Zealanders yet have the
courage to face the inevitable.
Just now New Zealand has problems
enough, it would seem, with the Cook
Islands which get interna] indepen-
dence in 1965.
On the other hand, reports drifting
back from the islands suggest that the
most likely result of self-government in
the Cooks is an eventual request for
wholehearted union with New Zealand.
Self-government will not affect either
New Zealand subsidies to the Cooks
(something like £5O a head a year) or
free entry of island produce to New
Zealand, but the tricky point is that
independence is a farce without econo-
mic self-sufficiency. And the Cooks—a
scattering of small tropical islands over
850,000 square miles of ocean —are a
long, long way from any kind of self-
sufficiency. New Zealand will have to
continue subsidising not only links with
the outside world but links between the
islands themselves.
Oddly, it seems to have occurred to no
speaker in the Parliamentary debate to
ask where the granting of independence
will stop: with the Cooks, or with the
Tokelau Islands (population 2000) or
Niue Island (population 5000)?
Anyway, the Cook Islands’ biggest
export is still people—7ooo live in New
Zealand as against 19,000 at home.
Western Samoan immigration here,
though nowhere near as spectacular in
relation to home population (around
125,000), has nevertheless remained
steady since the territory received inde-
pendence from New Zealand at the
beginning of 1962. It has been grimly
highlighted by the news that this Pacific
Paradise of James Michener and others
may be facing a major hunger problem
within the next ten years. The popula-
tion is increasing at a fantastic rate —
it will double to a quarter-million by
1985 —without any increase in agricul-
tural productivity. If anything, in fact,
agriculture has gone into a downhill
slide; banana plantations have been
stricken by disease, and prices for
cocoa and copra have fallen. Malnutri-
tion is already beginning to show.
Meantime, there is not much indica-
tion that New Zealand really knows
what it is about in the South Pacific.
Some day, soon, the entire region must
be looked at as a whole. If New Zea-
land cannot take a sensible lead and
bring some order out of the muddle,
then some outsider probably will.


Waiting to Run Away
Sydney in the 1920s
By HECTOR BOLITHO
Shakespeare was the reason for my
emigrating from my
New Zealand, to the sophisticated
world of Sydney. It was the end of
1921 and the contrast between genteel
Auckland and worldly Sydney is still
fresh in my memory. I was living at
last. No longer did I have to worry
about the criticisms of aunts and neigh-
bors. I was 23, in love with my own
ideas, and dedicated to freedom. So I
settled down to the task of editing “The
Shakespearean Quarterly” for Allan
Wilkie, and I found a flat, as near
King’s Cross as possible. Ido not know
what has happened to this area in the
past 40 years but, in 1921, it was the
heart of Bohemia, and my innocent New
Zealand shoes led me there, quite
naturally. But something went wrong.
I found the most genteel landlady in all
Sydney. She said, “We don't take babies,
dogs nor theatricals”. So I hid my
nebulous association with Shakespeare
and moved in.
I kept a diary in those days and it
reveals me as a trifling, rather silly per-
son. I cannot imagine why so many
people were kind to me. I made fre-
quent visits to the Mitchell Library and
the introspective task of research. I was
more interested in records of the produc-
tion of Farquhar’s “The Recruiting
Officer” in June, 1789, and of Shake-
speare's “Henry the Fourth” in April,
1800, than in what was happening in
the immediate world around me.
Then two things happened to spread
my horizon. I moved from my genteel
little flat to No. 52 Macleay Street.
Does that mean anything to Sydney in
the 19605? I suppose not. It was a
boarding-house to all intents and pur-
poses, but it was run by a formidable
lady. I think she was Mrs Orr. She
changed for dinner in the evening and
always carried a black fan, which was
symbolic. It was a barrier, against all
who were, and all that was, incorrect.
In the meantime I had increased my
tasks by becoming a sort of sub-editor
on “The Telegraph” and then “The
Evening News”. All incredible because
I had no experience. But I suppose that
I fitted in somehow. At least, with two
salaries pouring in, and my urge for
hard work, I was able to live elegantly
—which I have always liked. So I stayed
at No. 52, changed for dinner every
night and became a civilised prig. At
any rate, that is how I see myself now.
At the same table sat G. F. Blandy who
was a.d.c. to the Governor, whose name
I forget. Blandy was a hero. He was
a member of the famous family in
Madeira who are still kings of the world
of madeira wine. He imported his own
wine and he taught me to drink it and
appreciate it.
The second event that increased my
horizon was meeting Frank Morton, then
assistant editor of “The Triad”. Look-
ing back suddenly, over more than forty
years, I enjoy the memory of men who
were kind to me. It is not a sentimental
indulgence, for true kindness is realistic.
Frank Morton was the first editor who
gave me encouragement as a writer.
Oh, the store of frustrated poems and
essays I had in my possession by then!
I have destroyed most of them since,
because they were really terrible. But
Frank Morton published some of my
poems and he became my friend. He
had a house by the beach at Manly
and I went there on Sundays and met
other strivers who also wished to write.
We swam, we ate in the sun, we talked,
and I slowly realised a pattern I had
not known in New Zealand. I could
become sentimental about those Sun-
days at Manly. Think, you older Aus-
tralians, what it meant to me, meeting
George Lambert, Margaret Preston, Thea
Proctor, and Adrian Feint. They invited
me to their studios and I watched them
at their work. I could just afford to
buy their pictures, so that I made my
walls come alive with my own choice.
A most important moment in the life
of any human being.
I had arrived in Sydney at an import-
ant time in Commonwealth history. The
Australians were beginning to share their
minds and their talents with England.
The exodus had begun as far back as
the 1870 s, with Gilbert Murray. I
met him many years later when he was
an old man, living near Oxford. He
talked naturally of his childhood as a
force in his mind and confirmed the
story he has told in his unfinished auto-
biography, of the sympathies he deve-
loped in his school at Mittagong—when
he wept bitterly because the other boys
threw stones at a wounded moorhen.
I met Melba when 1 was young. How
strange it is that I have lived long
enough to eat toast Melba and peche
Melba with a generation who have for-
gotten that she was a singer. Only the
other day I asked someone, “Who was
Melba?” and he answered, “She was a

ballet dancer”. I can imagine her
splendid indignation over that. I once
went to interview her and her arrogance
spoiled the charm I knew was there.
But I am forgetting myself, in Sydney,
in the early 19205. Then, I was not
intelligent enough to be aware of these
great developments. I was still at the
selfish age when I considered only my-
self. But I learned a great deal. One
fact which is curious, in a young man
whose blood could not be more “colo-
nial”, a word I rather like. It has a
rugged sound. I had an ancestor bom
in Virginia about 1643. My father was
born at Ballarat and, in New Zealand,
I was of the third generation born in
the colony. So I should have been eager
for the future. But I was a deserter. It
was already apparent that I was devoted
to the past. When I dared to make a
friend, he was a young architect. Eager
to learn from someone else’s mind, I
spent hours over his drawing board, and
he taught me to appreciate Georgian
buildings in Sydney, for their design and
craftsmanship as well as for their age
and history. I shall never forget when he
made me stand at the end of the street
while he described why St James’ Church
was so beautiful, with its fine copper
spire, viridian green against the harsh
blue sky.
“I want to run away”
T am ashamed of much of the diary I
kept, in the early 19205. I did not
appreciate the kindness of Sydney but
was always restless for escape. Part of
my task was theatrical criticism for “The
Evening News”, which was incongruous
as I knew little or nothing of the theatre.
I was a rebellious member of the staff
and the day came when the editor,
Major Knox, said “You're fired”.
I walked out of the office, across the
street to the office of the rival evening
newspaper, “The Sun”. I was engaged
immediately to write one or two feature
articles. In my young impudence I felt
that I had put Major Knox in his place.
But these outward signs of discontent
had roots in my desire to escape to Eng-
land. My task in writing of the theatre
meant that I met actors and actresses
and one day I went to tea with Gertrude
Elliot, then starring in a play in Sydney.
Her real name was Lady Forbes-
Robertson and she was sister of the
famous Maxine Elliot. On September
sth, 1923, I wrote in my diary:—
“To tea with Lady Forbes-Robertson
in her flat, high above the average house-
tops of Sydney. As we sat near the
window, looking out at the setting sun,
she told me stories of J. M. Barrie and
George Bernard Shaw; stories of the
London I have dreamed of for so long.
I talked to her about Erewhon, which I
have been re-reading, and she said that
Samuel Butler showed the manuscript to
Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson before it
was published. Tier husband and
Samuel Butler were great friends and
were bound together by a common de-
sire to paint pictures grand enough to be
accepted by the Royal Academy. Both
of them failed to do this.
“Lady Forbes-Robertson has revived
my old desire for London. On the way
home I passed a shipping office with its
lithographed steamers floating on Medi-
terranean blue ... I want to run away
—anywhere.”
Passion for Shakespeare
Co I ran away from Sydney. Actually
I sailed, in the first German cargo
boat that left the shores of Australia after
the 1914-18 war. Why I chose it Ido
not know. I was suddenly one of three
British exiles with a wholly German
crew a few of whom spoke a smattering
of English.
There was one sentimental episode on
the way. On October 2nd we arrived at
Adelaide. I wrote in my diary, “In the
afternoon I met Sir Josiah Symon, a
very old gentleman who has devoted his
life to law, politics and Shakespeare. He
has written two books about Shakespeare
and he presented me with copies of them.
Then he took me to his mountain house,
outside Adelaide.”
Sir Josiah’s passion for Shakespeare
held sway even in the garden. He had
made a plantation of almost every plant
and flower mentioned in the plays. It
was a strange and beautiful sight, as he
explained the flowers to me. Shake-
speare set on the slopes of an Australian
hill.
It was my last nostalgic experience.
I returned to the cargo boat and felt
lonely. I walked up and down the deck,
watching the sea and believing what
the atlas promised me: Aden, the Suez
Canal, Naples—and then London, with
all the welcome terrors the name implied.

FILMS
Canada’s Genius
By CATHERINE de la ROCHE
Charles Higham writes: Australian
documentaries have, despite their admir-
able technical qualities, tended to be
informative rather than interestingly
experimental or analytical of Australia’s
life. The Commonwealth Film Unit’s
employees are public servants and this
perhaps has resulted in a lack of crea-
tive drive and pressure in the work they
have been doing. Miss de la Roche, a
well-known English film critic, here
examines the work of a livelier body,
which leaves more room for inventive,
original and daring work by its directors,
the Canadian Film Board, as well as
the work of other Canadian enterprises.
For Canada the 1960 s are proving to
be a decade of growth in several direc-
tions. The 1967 World Fair, prepara-
tions for which have already transformed
Montreal’s skyline, is no doubt an incen-
tive. As 1 saw on a recent visit to
Montreal, Canada’s film industry is
expanding. Both the National Film
Board and private companies, long
known for their excellent shorts, have
in the last two years produced some
notable features. What is more, as
announced at the recent celebrations in
Montreal of the Board’s 25th anniver-
sary, a federal loan fund for private
feature film production is being set up.
To some extent this is part of cultural
and political changes in Quebec Province
of educational reforms, relaxed cen-
sorship and resurgent French-Canadian
nationalism, which seems to have stimu-
lated national self-expression in the arts
everywhere in Canada.'' And since about
1963, when a Canadian festival was
added to the Montreal International
Film Festival, Montreal has been regard-
ed as one of the centres, with Paris
and New York, of cinema verite.
Canadian cinema verite, however, has
its own character, and its origins are to
be found as much in the interview and
candid camera techniques of Canadian
documentary and television as in trends
abroad. Indeed, in its cultural develop-
ment Canada is an “emergent” nation,
where television, closely associated from
the outset with documentary film, has
preceded feature film production, and
is nearly as closely associated with it in
exchanging influences, developing talent
and, to a lesser degree, in providing an
outlet.
A ruling that 55% of television pro-
grammes must be Canadian has for
some time encouraged production of a
superior type of sponsored documentary.
As a result of this ruling, Canadian
features also have “shop window” and
other advantages on television (though
care has to be taken that, to quote a
distributor, theatres do not have to sell
in competition what the channels get
cheap or free).
So far most of Canada’s notable films
were wholly or partly financed from
public funds. Nearly twenty pictures
competed in each of the two Canadian
festivals held so far. Most of the shorts
were made by the NFB; the remainder
by CBC or private companies. One of
the two features presented in 1963,
“A Tout Prendre”, Claude Jutra’s partly
autobiographical story of a young man’s
search for identity, and one of the three
shown in 1964, “Trouble Fete”, a study
of life in a seminary, made in more
detached style by Pierre Patry, were
privately produced. The other three
were made by the NFB, which is not
really concerned with features, but in
these cases the material was found to
lend itself best to full-length treatment.
So the NFB, which has done much
experimenting, and supported pioneers,
like the cartoonist Norman McLaren,
has taken a leading part also in launch-
ing Canada’s nascent feature film in-
dustry.
These five features were made by
young directors, most of whom belong
to the “Cineastes de Quebec” group and
work in verite style, similar to that of
French nouvelle vague directors, Jean
Rouch particularly, though the Canadian
films do not intrude into private lives
as ruthlessly as his “Chronicle of a
Summer”. Made possible by the new,
more mobile and less obtrusive equip-
ment, cinema verite combines the old
ideal of truthful content with low pro-
duction costs.
Whether a story outline is worked out
in advance or in course of production,
roles are not only “type cast”, but some-
times partly modelled on the players
chosen and on their experiences of the
situations being portrayed. Backgrounds
are mostly real, dialogue is largely un-
scripted, and, like much of the fluid,
hand-held camerawork, improvised.
All live festival features are topical
and informed with a sense of national
character, French-Canadian in four,
English - Canadian in Don Owen’s
“Nobody Waved Goodbye”. Started as
a half-hour documentary for a television
series on probation officers, this picture
“grew” during production in Toronto.
The characters of an amoral young man
and his girl developed better than expect-
ed, and emphasis was shifted on them.
In “Cat in The Bag”, the 1964 prize-
winner, the director, Gilles Groulx, ob-
served the end of a relationship between
an immature boy and girl, and encourag-
ed the actors to participate in developing
the characters. The fifth, “Pour La Suite
du Monde”, by Michael Brault, is the
maturest. A poetic evocation of life
among the fisherfolk on Coudres
Island, it belongs as much to the old
traditions of documentary as the cinema
verite. Each of these pictures has dis-
tinction, and though not fully profes-
sional, all have technical polish.
One of the largest of Canada’s 60-
odd private companies, Budge Crawley’s,
known widely for his RCMP television
series, has also started making features.
“Amanita Pestilens”, directed by Rene
Bonniere of Cineastes de Quebec, and
“The Luck of Ginger Coffey”, by Brian
Moore, were awaiting release when I
left Canada, but I saw some of Craw-
ley’s shorts, one outstanding for Larry
Crosley’s “sound effect” music, all for
originality.
An effort is obviously being made to
create a native film industry of interna-
tional standard. Even more impressive
is the spontaneous if fragile reality of
a cultural awakening. But there is also
a deep awareness in Canadian film cir-
cles that if their cinema is to develop,
its subject range must be widened and
many problems solved.
In expanding his business, for ex-
ample, a successful distributor, instead
of backing a local production, went in
for a co-production in Britain. That was
before the federal loan announcement.

Virtually speaking her numbers, almost
masculinely hoarse and often out of
tune, Pearl Bailey nevertheless holds the
attention in her album of Van Heusen
songs by sheer force of personality; the
sombre, sharp flavor of her voice is an
acquired taste, but, once acquired, im-
possible to shake off. The songs them-
selves are, of course, routine, but the
delivery strips them of almost all their
sentimentality. Listen to “Impatient
Years” with its sickly lyrics and
schmaltzy orchestration, and marvel at
Miss Bailey’s transforming style. To
have her sing the first few bars of
“The Second Time Around” without
accompaniment was somebody’s stroke
of genius.
In “Garland at the Grove” the star is
heard at her best; and the audience,
sophisticated and aware of every detail
of her career, responds to her with a
deeply moving spontaneity. When she
belts across a strikingly original version
of “Purple People Eater” who could
resist the harshness, the gaiety, the raw
nerves and talent?
The new version of “Beyond the
Fringe” seems to me grossly overrated,
an undergraduate smartness replacing
real wit; but a parody of a Weill song has
a genuine, acid cleverness. In “Garbo”
the cold, external grace of the star, her
inability to express spontaneous emotion,
are disclosed in a series of excerpts from
her films. The fatuous dialogue, the
drawling, self-adoring voice, have a fus-
tian period flavor, but most of the ex-
cerpts are too short to enable the unini-
tiated to study her methods of building a
character.

Painting the Life-Force
The Archibald Prize. Art Gallery of NSW.
Ken Whisson. Macquarie Galleries, Sydney.
Manly Art Gallery Exhibition, Sydney.
Great portraits are pictures that look at
and recognise us. They speak of the
uniqueness and paradoxical universality
of man's image, of his fevered mind and
the bestial, yet glorious structure of his
body, his terrifying ambitions, hopes and
despairs.
There are no great portraits in the
Archibald. But three come close. Eric
Smith's “Len Hessing” is captured in a
hot-eyed frenzy of impulsive splashes of
paint that zip across the canvas in a
retina rocking stream of savage ferocity.
While there is little physical resemblance
to the subject, life-force in the brush
strokes themselves neatly conveys Hes-
sing’s quick-smart mental alertness and
nervous physical agility.
Andrew Sibley’s portrait of Norman
Williams is an example of how a chunk
of facts about the figure can be ground
through the painter’s fine mesh sensibility
and come out looking, if boneless, at least
select and refined.
Kevin Connor’s Justice Kitto, painted
in broad areas of sombre color and close
total range, convincingly portrays a de-
tached, introspective intelligence. Any
one of these three works can stand on
its merits as good portrait. That the
blunted curatorial aesthetics of the trus-
tees found them wanting is further evi-
dence of their merit.
Ken Whisson’s one-man show at the
Macquarie Galleries holds up a broken
mirror to the face of mankind, then
paints its distorted image as if it were
people that were cracked.
Every painting concerns itself with the
same irrational and ugly reflections on
life, resulting in what might be more
accurately described as a one picture
show. Though full of personal idiosyn-
crasies (which are their saving grace) the
paintings descend clumsily from the
Northern European expressionists. Whis-
son’s mentors, however, were painstaking
masters who lavished infinite preparation
and care on their work and did not seek
a certain truth but found it. Ele treats
draughtsmanship and painterly qualities
with an off-with-their-heads abandon, as
if they were optional accessories.
The Manly Art Gallery's current exhi-
bition and purchase prize awards have
almost made the bold leap forward into
modern art but have been jerked back
by the short chain of city council con-
servatism. The third annual competi-
tion was judged by critic Daniel Thomas.
Elis choice was an assemblage of scrap
aluminium and scrounged wood by Mik
Kitching wherein four grimy mewel
posts bisect the picture surface to form
a dirty double-cross. The Council, hor-
rified at the thought of owning avant-
garbage, faulted the award on the tech-
nicality of size. The next award choice
was a satiric comic-strip rendition of
a pile of packaged food by Ken Rein-
hard. Again the thought caused indiges-
tion and was disallowed on a techni-
cality. The 100 gns prize has finally
come to roost in the gentle hands of
Ted Singer for his competent but
hardly contemporary cityscape. These re-
jects were hung and greatly vitalised the
exhibition, until Kitching marched in and
removed his work, over the farcical
objection that his action “might be steal-
ing”. The Reinhard is still hanging.

BOOKS
The Old Age of Mrs Calvert
By VIVIAN SMITH
Late Call. Angus Wilson. Seeker and War-
burg. 325. 6d.
In an interview published a few years ago
in the “Paris Review” Angus Wilson
admitted that he preferred his fictional
characters to be highly self-conscious,
complex individuals, and that he was in-
clined to be impatient of simple souls.
Certainly his main characters Meg
Eliot, Bernard Sands, Gerald Middleton,
Simon Carter are all sophisticated, in-
volved people, many of them intellectuals
subject to the neuroses and distresses to
which intellectuals are prone. Most of
them are upper middle-class types with
money to spend on entertainment and
travel, some of them wealthy enough to
collect paintings or porcelain.
It is all the more remarkable then that
he should have created Sylvia Calvert as
the heroine of his new novel a woman
of 64, one time manageress of genteel,
private seaside hotels; an uneducated, un-
assuming person from a poor background
who has never been outside England.
Sylvia is forced to retire from Palmeira
Court, ostensibly for health reasons,
mainly because of complaints against her
husband by one of the guests. They go
to stay at the “Sycamores”, the home of
Sylvia’s son, Harold, headmaster of a
local secondary modern school, author of
such educational books as “The Blokes at
the Back of the Class”. Harold's wife has
just died and he is trying, without much
success, to bring up his three almost-
adult children. Harold is a devoted
teacher, a progressive given to a life of
practical good works. It is to his world in
the New Town of Carshall that Sylvia
tries to adapt, as well as to her own sud-
den new world of enforced retirement
and idleness.
Sylvia’s husband, Arthur, has always
been a cause of worry to her. Gassed in
the First World War, “Captain” to
strangers, he is a garrulous, gambling,
borrowing, yarning old “character”, full
of charm and without integrity. Living
with Harold and his children all bur-
dened with their own tensions and prob-
lems is marked by inevitable frictions,
failures and failings. Sylvia is somewhat
overwhelmed by their brightness and
cleverness: “We've never been clever,”
she says of herself and Arthur on one
occasion “We’re nobodies.” But it is
one of the points of the novel to show
that the clever is little in front of the
humane. The nobodies are never the nul-
lities in Wilson's world.
Sylvia is big, rather fat and awkward,
and her lack of quickness, her physical
inability to be unobtrusive, in spite of her
native shyness and her constant desire
to be inconspicuous, is brought home
to us. She is the gentlest and the
most passive of Wilson's heroines, the
least interfering and the most sympathe-
tic he has created.
While this novel shows Wilson’s deep-
ening range, it would be mistaken to see
it as an entirely new departure. Like all
of Wilson’s books it is concerned with
the search for identity, with discovering
one’s own reality as a person.
Throughout her life, Sylvia has been a
victim, someone whose individuality has
been either crushed, thwarted or ignored
on the few occasions when it has been
able to show itself. This is the signifi-
cance of the prologue set in 1911 which
shows her childhood among brutal,
drunken, chapel-going Suffolk farmers.
If hers has been a life of devotion and
self-sacrifice, it has also been a life in
which her sense of herself as a person
has been muffled almost to the point of
extinction. When she first arrives at
“Sycamores” no one will let her help
with the housework, but will later create
absurd little jobs to keep her occupied.
It has been a pattern throughout. And one
of the multiple meanings of the title is
Sylvia’s late call to life, to her own
reality.
It is perhaps one of the subtlest notes
in this novel that Sylvia should incarnate
the principles of growth, development
and discovery, while her son Harold—•
the progressive headmaster should rep-
resent the fixed and the static. Harold’s
ideas about teaching, bringing up child-
ren his view of himself as a tolerant,
broadminded liberal were all formed
years ago: fixed principles in favor of
freedom and rebellion have hardened into
empty abstractions, rigid and rather re-
mote from the pressing realities around
him. Harold is a typical Wilsonian idealist
so good with classes, groups, ideas and
generalisations (his text books are highly
regarded)—much less successful with
individuals. He fails with his own
children.
In several novels, Wilson has been pre-
occupied with the problems of middle
age and in “Late Call” he turns his atten-
tion to the fears and longings of old age.
Novels with central characters in their
mid-sixties are very rare and the origi-
nality of “Late Call” on this score alone
is worth noting. Wilson has, I think,
written more movingly and more con-
vincingly of the pervasive, lingering fear
of death than any other novelist of his
generation and it is part of Sylvia's
victory that she learns to live with her
fears without being submerged by them.
Throughout the novel she is constantly
haunted by one particular news item of
the day the murder in Ibizia of the
companion of a woman she had once
had as a guest in one of her hotels
and images of murder, destruction, the
attitude to the old she sees bodied fortn
in “Look Back in Anger”, put on locally
by Harold, pass through her mind and
add to her sense of doom and foreboding.
Such passing images interweave with
memories of her past, momentary reco -
lections of her two dead children, her
life with Arthur and if at times we
should be reminded of Virginia Woolf,
there are others where in the vision of
evil, disorder and fear we are reminded
of Dostoevsky and Dickens, perhaps
nowhere more than in the novel’s strange
and haunting deployment of its hunch-
back motif.
The contrast between the present and
the past is one of the most important fea-
tures of the book. (“There was only a
past you couldn't change and a future
you couldn’t see into”.) New Town rep-
resents the modern, the progressive. Judy,
Harold’s snobbish, francophile daughter,
longs for the past, gracious country
living, the small, old churches with their
“real sense of order and tradition”. But
if Sylvia is overwhelmed by the present,
and associates the modernity of Harold’s
progressive world with cemeteries, she
nevertheless fully appreciates all the ad-
vances that have been made in the mod-
ern world: she never glamorises the past,
which the prologue shows to us in all its
hideous reality. And if Harold fails with
his children, at least his way of bringing
them up is preferable to her own
bringing-up.
Wilson’s religious preoccupations, al-
ready present in “Hemlock and After”
and “The Middle Age of Mrs Eliot”, are
here more overt than he has allowed him-
self in the past. Bernard and Meg both


pass through intense personal crises; both
finahy resist and reject conventional reli-
gious consolations. So finally does Sylvia
Calvert. But one of the key passages in
this novel a characteristic mixture of
social observation with tragic overtones
is the sermon scene where Sylvia at-
tends the modern church with Harold
and the children to hear the progressive
rector preach (“Rather a controversial
figure. You never get any of this dry-as-
dust theological stuff from him. Last
Easter he gave a sermon on the eleven
plus"). They find that at the last moment
the sermon is to be given by a very old
Scottish preacher. “Good works’ll not
save your soul alive,” he says. “We ask
for Grace to be given to us. No, not all
the charity, the social work, as they call
it now, can save your soul alive if there’s
nothing left to save. Go out . . . into the
dreadful silence, into the dark nothing-
ness, out through the desert and the
night.” Harold and his “set” are devoted
to good works but their conception
of charity is an increasingly mechanical
one. Typical of this is Muriel Bartley:
“No one did more for others if it
wasn't 'the damned kids that nobody
wanted’ it was sure to be ‘the poor devils
who can’t see’, or ‘the blighters who are
born a bit wonky in the head’ so many
causes that Sylvia had never got around
to helping.”
Sylvia is moved by this sermon. She
undergoes a prolonged stage of unhappi-
ness (her time in the desert and the
night) and suffers a slight stroke. During
a thunderstorm which arises on one of
her long walks she rescues a child, and
her relationship with this young girl and
her Canadian parents restores to her a
new confidence and a sense of her own
reality. She recovers the will to live and
to be involved in life once more and
this will to involvement is seen as an
act of Grace.
One of Angus Wilson's strengths is
the way he relates the realistic and the
symbolic with a compelling inevitability,
and the storm scene where Sylvia over-
comes her fears and the destructive forces
that have been contending in her is one
of the finest achievements in the whole of
his fiction, a triumph of precarious
balance.
At the end of each of his novels, Wil-
son’s central characters choose to be
alone; they choose independence. They
become fully and finally aware of pos-
sibilities and limitations. Gerald Middle-
ton goes to Mexico; Meg Eliot leaves
David for a w'orking life of travel; Simon
Carter decides to apply for the director-
ship of the zoo. Here Sylvia, after
Arthur's death, with her own realisation
that death is still some way off for her,
decides to leave “Sycamores” and take a
flat of her own. In each case the paradox
is the same: in fully accepting themselves
the characters can accept others; in
achieving detachment from themselves
they arrive at a fuller sympathy and
understanding of those around them.
They pass through the darkness and start
to live in the light.
Readers of Wilson’s fiction will see in
this novel the deepening of tendencies al-
ready present throughout his work. There
is the same mixture of hilarious comedy
and tragedy, some fine party scenes with
a blending of prickly social embarrass-
ment and verbal humor. And those who
delighted in the parodies that were rele-
gated to an appendix in “Anglo-Saxon
Attitudes” will find many equally brilliant
(take-offs of television shows and popular
romance novels) incorporated here into
the text of the book.
In spite of the slightly schematic na-
ture of the prologue, this is in some ways
Wilson’s most effortless book. As a shape
it lacks the marvellous intricacy of “The
Middle Age of Mrs Eliot” and is closer
to “Hemlock and After” in design than
to any of his other novels. But it is
marked by the energy of concern, the
urgency of conviction that are the hall-
marks of Wilson’s genius. And in Sylvia
we have the warmest, the most moving
character he has yet created.
Love that Violence
The Underground Sketchbook of Tomi
Ungerer. Bodley Head. 265. 6d.
There’s nothing to be gained from being
against concentration camps, etc., because
everyone is against them. There’s no
future in “humanism”, because everyone
is a humanist, nearly, and it doesn't make
for interesting art. On the other hand it
would seem wasteful to forget about the
whole horrible thing: artists can always
use a gimmick. Hence the current cult
of violence. I imagine its exponents
would defend it on the grounds that it
keeps the wound healthily open. Lest we
forget, and all that. But in fact most of its
exponents are aesthetes: “violence" exists
for its own sake, a sufficient subject in
itself, an autonomous sensation. Thus in
some recent British verse, hard up for
something to say and terrified lest it
might actually say something, the link has
been severed between violence and those
who do it or have it done to them. Vio-
lence has become a suitable poetic topic,
like purling streams in an earlier age—
with the difference that no one ever gloat-
ed over purling streams, and it wouldn’t
have mattered much if they had.
The cartoons of Tomi Ungerer (born
in Strasbourg in 1931) are sometimes
genuine satire when they have a real
subject or object, but more often they
partake of this detestable brand of aesthe-
ticism, where cruelty and loathing exist in
a vacuum, gratuitous, unrelated to the
outside world. It may seem old-fashioned
to ask that every picture should tell a
story, but in fact every picture does tell a
story, whether you want it to nor not. Mr
Ungerer’s picture of a man and a woman
with their hands nailed down together on
a table tells a story about marriage, a
rather old story. The picture of a woman
divided horizontally into numbered sec-
tions and a man making off with one
section guess which? is an old and
boring story, and a good example of a
contemporary artistic phenomenon: ex-
cess of technique over meaning, hyper-
trophy of style and atrophy of matter.
The picture of a man staring aghast at
blood leaking from the base of a red traf-
fic light leaves the audience to complete
the story. The picture of a baby pegged
by its ears to a clothes-line and the pic-
ture of a naked woman eviscerating a
man by way of his mouth tell a tale about
the artist and his audience.
The best things here are the anti-war
cartoons. The sentry-box made of an up-
ended coffin, the skeleton photographing
an atomic explosion, the machine-
gun which fires small human heads and
ejects the rest of the body, these are
simple enough, but they possess subject-
matter, however unfashionable it may be,
and therefore qualify as satirical com-
ment. Other drawings are simple too, but
essentially meaningless for instance,
little people having their heads removed
by bigger people with corkscrews ex-
cept in terms of self-indulgence. Since
by implication 1 have praised Mr Unger-
er’s technique, 1 had better add that he is
heavily indebted to George Grosz, owes
something to Thurber (but Mr Ungerer's
married couple fight in a boxing ring with
barbed wire for ropes) and has borrowed
a tinge of extra nastiness from Aubrey
Beardsley. He himself contributes
a deliberate crudeness of line which
makes Art Buchwald’s comment that Mr
Ungerer is saying: ‘‘Women can give you
a bad time, but they got nice figures”, the
funniest thing in the book. The nice
figures are made up of huge buttocks
and breasts, spindly legs and extremities
shaped as claws or screws.
In his preface Jonathan Miller tells us
that to read through this volume is to
“enjoy a sulphuric moral experience”.
Exactly: you are meant to enjoy these
drawings. The book doesn't even start to
make you hate cruelty or violence: it
simpiy helps you to hate or despise
people, and the patients more than the
agents. Since we need no help in this
matter, the book would seem totally re-
dundant. But perhaps Mr Miller only
brought in the word “moral” because he
needed a buffer to stand between “sul-
phuric” and “experience”. And after all,
it has come to mean much the same as
“aesthetic”.

Shattered Lives
Anno Domini. George Steiner. Faber.
265. 6d.
Rattle of a Simple Man. Charles Dyer. Elek.
20s.
George Steiner’s three stories all deal
with the Second World War —with
people who were involved in it and
finally destroyed by it. But the destruc-
tion is not simple bullets and bombs
killing. Bullets and bombs, the fashion
of the escape stories and fighter pilot
reminiscences of the ’fifties, have been
replaced by more subtle horrors. Now,
twenty years after the war ended, the
themes are mental tortures, sadism,
memories of violence and breakdown.
The German officer in the first story has
a shattered leg, has seen his family
burnt alive in Hamburg—but has sur-
vived. He returns to a French farm
where he was stationed, and where he
hanged a youth for signalling to the
British. He marries the boy’s sister on
his return, and the villagers trample him
to death in a wedding dance. In the
second story an American revisits a
mental hospital where he hid during
the war, and where he fell in love with
a Jewish girl who was discovered and
removed by the Nazis; he meets her
betrayer at the end. and seems to go
mad. The main character of the third
story, an English officer with nightmares
after the war, kills himself on the last
page.
Before he kills himself he has sessions
with a psychiatrist and it appears that
despite getting a barmaid pregnant while
at Oxford—a sensuously evoked early
scene in the story—he is a repressed
homosexual; his dreams have got worse
since the return of a close schoolfriend
from America. Mental sickness, indeed,
is as much a feature of the stories as
the violence of the war. It is certainly
not fortuitous that an asylum is the
setting of the second story—and its nar-
rator has an obsessive interest in torture
after seeing some Nazi officers grind a
girl’s face in gravel. Though mental
disorder is not present at the expense
of cruelty in Mr Steiner’s carefully
packed prose. When a dog bites the
heel of the German officer’s built-up
surgical shoe, the officer breaks its back
with his cane. And the multiplication
of incident is paralleled by the lapping
phraseology. “He had learned to live
with his pain as one lives with a familiar
yet treacherous animal. He conceived
of it as a large cat which honed its
claws, drawing them like slow fire from
shoulder to heel, and then crouching
down again in the dim and middle of
his body.” Notice the careful vocabu-
lary—“honed its claws” —and the
Romantic ecstasy of pain “drawing
them like slow fire”—and that Shake-
spearean touch of phrase—“dim and
middle”.
Three years ago A. Alvarez wrote
that the trouble with English poetry was
its gentility, its decency, its lack of
concern with the realities of life like
Auschwitz, Hiroshima and psychology.
He succinctly indicates what is wrong:
“but as England was not affected by the
concentration camps, so it has remained,
on the whole, contemptuously imper-
vious to psychology”. His anthology,
“The New Poetry”, was a collection of
poems going in the right direction with
the right concerns. And now Steiner
seems to have produced the New Short
Story fit to stand by Alvarez’s manifesto
for poetry.
After the tortured sex and the sexual
tortures, the tenderness and the blood-
shed of “Anno Domini”, “Rattle of a
Simple Man” is a straightforward re-
assuring strip-tease. Percy Winthram has
taken a bet to sleep with a prostitute,
and for 192 pages we’re kept waiting
with his pants up, as she changes from
slit back dress to slacks and blouse with
no bra, and as he irons his shirt, makes
tea and washes up. He’s nearly forty,
virgin and a scoutmaster, while she is
played by Diane Cilento in the Sidney
Box film.
Charles Dyer has, as the blurb puts
it, “extended and given a background”
to his very successful play. The exten-
sions, of Percy’s home town, his youth,
his scouts, and of Cyrenne’s Welsh
childhood and Spanish-Greek-Welsh
parentage are dull stuff, but they pad
out the tete-a-tete to novel length. And
the tete-a-tete itself is often very funny;
the dialogue has its jokes, and the
descriptions of Cyrenne’s bare back or
bosom make a good late night’s read,
cosier than going to bed with your socks
on.

Another Spring
Sun on the window chair, the noise of
flies
striking at rigid glass. Another spring.
Hard against the stronger glass I bang
seeking what is outside —I recognise
light, shape and color true enough to
seize,
the season tangible and happening.
Glass will not break; there is no opening.
After its rage is done, each insect dies.
Summer tomorrow; through the hidden
glass
a greater heat, imperishable light.
My tight cage jerks me back. But who'll
forget
such promises? Again. Effort must force
some recompense. Again then. Let me
sing:
Even the buzz of flies defines the spring.

Lytton Straehev’s World
Spectatorial Essays. Lytton Strachey. Chatto
and Windus. 365.
“A good critic,” writes Lytton Strachey,
“is like a good talker —he must know
the difficult art of ‘bringing out’ an
author, of realising his strong points, of
making him show himself at his very
best ...” A reviewer might also set
himself this worthy aim; yet there is in
these essays, little evidence that Lytton
Strachey was much concerned with
practising what he preached. Most of
his “Spectator” articles, here reprinted
for the first time, are slight, and only
marginally concerned with their sup-
posed subject. Readers expecting to
find in them some foreshadowing of
the author of “Eminent Victorians” will
be disappointed; only in the essay “The
Author of ‘Hudibras’ ” does he show a
little of the curiosity about character
and motive which was to make him the
famous though, in spite of his own
disclaimer, far from impartial bio-
grapher.
His opinions are not particularly stimu-
lating. On Shakespeare he is merely
pedestrian, though rhetorically inflated.
He is unjust to the point of inaccuracy
to Johnson as a critic. He makes an
unsuccessful attempt at lightness in his
essay on “The Swan of Lichfield”—a
subject upon which, one would sup-
pose, it is impossible to be dull. Only
rarely does he take fire from his sub-
ject—in his defence of French classical
poetry, and of Pope against criticisms
of the “artificial” style, in his discussion
of Wordsworth’s “grandiloquence”, and
in a brief but sharp comparison between
Voltaire’s “Candide” and Swift’s “A
Modest Proposal”. His essay on James
Thomson exhibits best his censorious
mood, and includes some shrew'd obser-
vations. But Thomson is after all a
very minor poet; and it is easier to write
well (and unfavorably) about the near-
talented, than it is to shed light on the
great.
So in fact Strachey himself is not
responsible for the value of this book,
which, though limited, is real enough.
The most interesting part of it is James
Strachey’s Preface, with its revelation of
their cousin St Loe's editorial methods
as owner-editor of “The Spectator”. It
is diverting, to say the least of it, to
imagine St Loe sitting in his office every
Thursday afternoon, solemnly inserting
editorial pronouncements of the we-are-
of-the-opinion variety into his contri-
butors’ articles, thereby imposing his
own views and personality upon each
section of the periodical. (Incidentally,
the fact that in his articles Lytton
Strachey had, as James puts it, “an un-
seen collaborator”, made him hesitate
for a long time, and makes him still
uneasy, about publishing them.) St Loe
suddenly looms up in the essay on
Bacon, w'here after Lytton has quoted
Bacon on “Stimulation and Dissimula-
tion”, St Loe booms over his shoulder:
“We may not like his conclusion —for
ourselves, we repudiate it as immoral
and ignoble—but who can deny that it
is an epitome of the worldly wisdom on
the matter under consideration?” Who
indeed? St Loe is not only an unseen
collaborator, but an unseen character,
whose presence is sensed on more than
one occasion. He works rather to
Lytton’s advantage.
Then there is the interest of Strachey’s
material. The period covered by the
articles (1904-1913) saw substantial ad-
vances in English scholarship and criti-
cism. and Strachey was tossed up for
review many books that any reviewer
would like to be offered. His essay on
Dostoevsky, slight in itself, nevertheless
conveys something of the impact of his
w'ritting upon an English audience then
new to it; and in his few theatrical re-
views he puts us in touch with some great
actors of his day. But emphatically this is
not Strachey’s book. It belongs to his dis-
tinguished subjects, writers and scholars,
and to his formidable literary guardian,
Cousin St Loe.

Selected, picked from mountains of

those of the bright colors.
It was to be a brilliant orange

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Whittling at Overseas Reserves
Warnings of an impending fall in Australia’s interna-
tional reserves were confirmed by a drop of £23.1m.
to £824.5m. in December. The trend evidently
continued in January, judging by the Reserve Bank’s report
that its holdings of gold and foreign exchange fell £lom. in
the three weeks to January 20.
The trade deficit of £55.9m. for the half-year to Decem-
ber was a warning in itself, particularly as it did not include
invisible items. Australia has been fortunate enough in
the past to shrug off such deficits, because of the very
healthy inflow of capital. The camouflage of capital inflow,
however, wore a little thin in December. There are a
Variety of for this 1 including a possible repatri-
ation of loan funds used to finance imports. ' " '
The unsettled attitude towards sterling also must have
had its effect, even if only to the extent of interrupting pre-
viously-made plans while waiting to see if European pres-
sures really could cause a devaluation of sterling (and a
consequent effect on the £Australian).
Measures taken to counteract the run on sterling un-
doubtedly caused some flutterings in Treasury and banking
circles because of the sharp jump in UK bank rate which,
at 7 p.c., offers remarkably high interest for those wishing
to take advantage of lucrative deposit rates.
Respectable slices of Australian foreign exchange, in fact,
are held on deposit and would enjoy any upward revision
in interest rates. The nagging worry, of course, is the
serious capital loss to Australia’s international reserves if
sterling did devalue. Consequently there has been some
agitation for Australia to switch some of her sterling hold-
ings into gold, an act which would cause some embarrass-
ment in Whitehall, where it is expected that the remaining
pieces of the Commonwealth should stick together in any
financial crisis.
There has been no switch out of sterling. Australia’s
small increase of £3.6m. to £ 100.9 m. in gold holdings in
the latter part of 1964 was a natural occurrence.
The Reserve Bank’s report of a fall of £ 12.1 m. in foreign
exchange in the week to January 20 naturally arouses
curiosity. Questions are being asked if Australia might
even consider a repatriation of some of her overseas funds.
These international reserves are a back-stop in trading re-
lations and a prestige rating which assists loan raisings
overseas. So the Government is unlikely to detract from
such a status symbol, except for defence expenditure. In
fact, when funds are borrowed overseas they are added to
Australia’s international reserves.
The reserves take on added significance in this current
half-year when export earnings are not expected to match
the imports bill. The Associated Chambers of Commerce
believe Australia may incur a trade deficit of around £loom.
for 1964-65. High-priced copper imports and loss of
Mount Isa’s exports will be just another drain at a time
when wool and sugar prices have slipped and invisibles
(freight, insurance) are mounting.
It is indeed fortunate that Australia’s overseas reserves
are at such a high level and able to withstand a bit of a
knocic. TeTit !5 fatuQU&LlQ. ignore _the: hjeh content of
capital inflow in those reserves, plus accumulated profit? ot
overseas companies and Government borrowings on over-
seas markets. This is the time to add to those reserves with
a renewed export drive, so that if Britain is forced into
another financial crisis this year the reserves will be strong
enough to withstand a sharp blow.
Never Look Back
While Australian stock markets in January eased to their
lowest point since late 1963, the US Dow Jones index
shimmied up past the 900 barrier and said “There, I told
you so!” before slipping back again. American investors
are a dedicated group, so it appeared to be a matter of per-
sonal prestige that Dow Jones should break new ground.
This is definitely something the Russians can’t match.
Market realists in the US would never have supported
the stock market rise if profits had not kept pace. Although
analvsts predicted that last year’s tax cuts would permit
profit rates to increase, it was necessary for many investors
to adopt a cautious note until they saw the results on the
board. A booming motor vehicle industry led the way and,
as a result, the stock market index maintained a steady
barometer of just over 19 times the earnings per share of
the stocks which comprise the index. That, then, has been
the bade reason whv buyers were willing to push the index
past the 900 barrier.
Expressed in stock market prices, the earnings ratio re-
mained unchanged in 1964. If corporate profits continue
to improve in the next quarter, there will be further justi-
fication for the bulls to press forward with the index, keep-
ing it at the level of around 19 times earnings.
After the 1964 rise in US company profits, the percent-
age increase for 1965 should slow down unless there is
some unexpected impetus. What confounds the critics, of
course, is that profits (and the market) still keep rising
despite cautions that there must be a downturn. You can’t
buck profits, whereas the arguments for a downturn usually
are historical, together with an inbuilt fear from past experi-
ence. If you are not “with it” on managed economies it’s
hard to shake off that fear.

Background to Wage Hearings
A time to consider principles
IZ'een point-counterpoint from rival
advocates Robinson and Hawke in
the Arbitration Commission last week
got the annual wage hearings off to a
lively start in a year which might have
expected merely a brief session to decide
whether the basic wage as fixed at the
lengthy full review in 1964 should be
adjusted for changes in consumer prices
over the last year. Instead, undaunted
by its rejection last year, the employers
have refurbished their arguments for
a total wage and in what they consider
will be very protracted hearings (lasting
possibly three months, they told me)
will press it before the Commission,
consisting, they hope, of the presidential
members only.
Whether non-presidential members
will sit is yet to be determined. Mr
Hawke argued strongly that they should.
This would bring in ex-vice-president of
the ACTU Mr Commissioner Winter,
who, being the Commission’s officer
concerned with the metal trades indus-
try, on whom the employers’ log of
claims has been served, obviously has
special qualifications for the hearings as
they relate directly to that industry.
On the other hand, if the total wage
proposal is accepted by the Commission,
to be fully effective in leading us out
of the current “wilderness” of wages
determination it would have to be given
the widest application over the whole
country. So, although Commissioner
Winter sat on the total wage case last
year, it could be argued that his pre-
sence is unnecessary.
Whereas last year the total wage pro-
posal played second fiddle to the basic
wage claim, this year, even if the cases
are heard simultaneously, the main
focus looks like being on the total wage.
In any case this year’s basic wage
claim for an average rise of 10s. a week
is modest compared with the 525. a week
the unions wanted last year (and got
205.), so that this matter should be dealt
with more expeditiously. As the 10s.
asked for by the unions is practically
consonant with the 4 p.c. increase in
consumer prices, the unions seem to be
skipping that it is open to them to re-
quest something from productivity
gains. The latter wasn’t possible in
1962 and 1963, when interim hearings
were confined to considering possible
cost-of-living adjustments. But in last
year’s judgment the Commission de-
parted from its 1961 ruling to the effect
that it left it to the parties “to apply
as they may be advised either for real
or money changes in the basic wage”.
It may be a bit late in the day for
this year's wages round, but seconds in
both corners and indeed the referees at
ringside should take heed that the public
is weary of marathon bouts, that it
wants the whole proceedings speeded up,
less repetition of arguments, more writ-
ten submissions and a general stream-
lining. All this is apart from any need
for changes in method and principles,
whether a total wage is the answer or,
if it is not, whether the Arbitration
Commission can do more to rationalise
the present wages structure. These are
matters to which the employers, at least,
have given deep thought and considera-
tion.
Obviously the Commission needs to
clear its mind of claims for current
adjustments to the basic wage and get
R. G. FRY
Director, Metal Trades Employers' Assoc.
down to consider the principles behind
the total wage proposition as well as its
practicability. This still seems unlikely

to happen this year and Mr Hawke,
who loves to roam in the flowerless
wilderness of the wage-fixing arena, will
be more than happy if it does not.
Possibly the Commission, or at least
some members of it, has the total wage
on its conscience. Yet if it could find
six specific reasons for rejecting it last
year and, even in deference to the total
wage, will not lightly forgo its tradi-
tional role of making a broad swish at
economic judgments (such as last year,
when one half arrived at an award
increase twice as big as the other half),
to Mr Hawke its adoption would mean
the loss of a labyrinth with a prize for
the unions at every corner. It is ironic
to regard the unions’ approach to the
concept as myopic, as Mr R. G. Fry,
the director of the Metal Trades Em-
ployers, did the other day, asking them
to lift their heads from the sands of
a 1935 industrial setting, and look at the
proposition for a total wage objectively,
flexibly, as befitting the industrial reali-
ties twenty years on. They know what
they are at.
The unions count very seriously the
separate gains they stand to make and
have made over the years (in none more
fruitfully than the last six of Mr Robin-
son’s nightmare) along so many different
avenues —basic wage, margins, leave,
hours and any other in which they can
see grounds for arranging a dispute and
oblige the Commission to adjudicate.
The chances are many and can be taken
without sacrificing in any way the best
one of all in a full employment economy
—that of bidding up wages and other
benefits in the open market for scarce
labor. Nor is it lost on them that if the
adoption of a total wage was to be made
fully effective it would mean the loss of
employees’ rights to ply in the open
market. Unless they gave up such
rights and abided by the Commission’s
rulings on a total wage, the distribution
of full national productivity through
award wages would be impracticable.
The Commission would in fact be
hamstrung by wages drift, to which it
referred in its rejection of the total
wage last year—‘‘ln addition to all this
there is a wages drift representing pay-
ments made by employers above award
rates and this drift is something which
operates independently of the Commis-
sion.” Before it proceeded to adopt a
total wage it would need reassurances
from the unions’ side for a freeze in
over-award payments. Frankly, looking
round the economy today, it is clear
that many unions are placing more re-
liance on open market operations than
on the Arbitration Commission to satisfy
their wage demands.
Not only that. The unions see the
total wage proposal as isolating them
from other groups in the economy. In-
deed the logical extension of the idea,
which might not be wholly acceptable
to employers (it would certainly not be
to many people), would be to fix all
incomes in the community, to have in
fact an all-embracing incomes policy.
The Commission plugged this line of
objection very hard when rejecting the
total wage submission last year.
In one passage its judgment stated
that “while not underestimating the im-
portance of wages and salaries in the
national economy, we nevertheless con-
sider that the application of the pro-
posal only to wages and salaries, as it
would have to be if the Commission
were to adopt it, and not to other in-
comes is another reason for declining,
at least at this stage, to attempt to apply
the employers’ proposal”. Again, “we
also are not prepared to assume that
prices will necessarily move in conso-
nance with any economic theory or for-
mula. If we were to deal with wages
in the manner proposed by the employ-
ers it might in current circumstances in
Australia well work an injustice to em-
ployees who are affected directly or
indirectly by the Commission's awards.
It may be important, however, to note
that different considerations might well
apply if the Commission’s work were
performed in a setting in which there
was an overall policy both as to incomes
of all types, and as to prices . . . The
Commission is not a national incomes
commission”.
The Commission found other objec-
tions. The most intractable, and the
one on which the employers will have to
do their hardest talking this year, is
that referred to in last year’s majority
basic wage judgment, where Justices
Kirby and Moore state bluntly “neither
price movements nor productivity move-
ments should in our view be applied
automatically and inevitably nor should
they be the only things considered in
a review of the real basic wage”.

MARKET MOVES:
The main business of this firm is the
management of portfolio investment for
substantial clients. In choosing stocks
for purchase or sale, due regard is paid
to company performance, balance sheet
features, the growth or decline in earn-
ings per share, and the like. However,
we also recognise that the market move-
ment of a stock may be quite at variance
with the apparent company merit. We
recommend sound company stocks for
purchase only if market studies indicate
independently that the price is likely to
move upwards. Similarly, notwithstand-
ing apparent company prosperity, we
may recommend the sale of stocks which
appear likely to fall heavily in the market.
The methods which we use in forecasting
market behaviour were developed for
use in Australia exclusively by this Firm.
We began to publish Trendex several
years ago, to bring the methods to the
notice of investors generally. Subscrib-
ers receive a book describing the tech-
niques in detail, so that they can apply
them for themselves. Many investors
are doing this with success. Subscribers
receive also, each week, the latest issue
of Trendex. In Trendex we describe cur-
rent examples of the methods in action,
and follow through each week on the
hundred or more stocks kept under con-
stant supervision therein.
Trendex is noted for pointing out major
changes in the price trend of individual
stocks, well ahead of these changes be-
coming recognised and accepted by the
general run of brokers and investors.
MOUNT ISA:
This company has a wonderful mine,
which will probably keep growing and
outlive all of us. However, the shares
move up and down, just like those of all
other companies. Our subscribers like
to sell near the top and buy again near
the bottom, on the major moves, and
that is just what they have been doing.
After buying around 36 6 in September
1963, our subscribers sold at about 46/11
in September 1964. They will be buying
again—but only when it is time to do so.
CRESTKNIT:
This stock, bought at 8 '6 last April, has
held firm through the recent market
setbacks, and is beginning its run.
C.S.R.
Trendex subscribers have done well in
this stock, buying low and selling high,
and the shares of this magnificent com-
pany give plenty of scope. After a beau-
tiful rise up to £92 (now 92/-) where
selling signals were given, prices tumbled
to below 50/- in 1962, more than achiev-
ing the target set in Trendex. When
Trendex gave the signal to buy again
around 60/- in 1963, targets of 79/- and
then 88/- were set and the reasons given.
Prices moved forward and spent "about
three months between 78/- and 80/-, and
then advanced to a top at 89/9. Soon
afterwards, selling signals were given
again, and the price of the stock is head-
ed downwards towards its target—which
is still a little ahead. It will be good buy-
ing again then.
CAPTAIN PRODUCTS:
Trendex subscribers bought this stock
at 67 3 in April last. It has had a nice
run. Is this a warm up, with great things
ahead, or has it topped out?
BURNS PHILP:
After nearly doubling its price in a
little over twelve months, this stock dis-
played characteristic “market top” be-
haviour, and Trendex subscribers sold
around 88/- in December. Burns Philp
will be good buying again eventually for
the next long rise—but not yet,
ASSOCIATED SECURITIES:
Trendex subscribers like to act ahead of
the news, not after it. They bought this
stock around 16/6 some weeks ago, and
will still be with it when it is more
popular at much higher prices.
BUY LOW, SELL HIGH:
Trendex subscribers don’t usually buy
at the very bottom, nor sell at the very
top—who does? They buy when market
action shows that a good rise lies ahead.
They sell when the market action signals
tell them that the stock is destined for
a severe fall. The signals are not ahvays
right, either—who is? But the astonish-
ingly high forecasting score is gaining
widespread notice.
Would you rather buy the stock that
“should” move up (but doesn’t), or the
stock which shows by its market action
that it is about to move up (even though
the reason hasn’t made the news columns
yet) ? The Trendex subscriber likes to
buy when the stock is going up, and sell
when it is going down. He can then relax
and listen to the news in peace and com-
fort later on.
TRENDEX DOESN'T HEDGE:
Trendex states the conclusions from
market action bluntly, and without hedg-
ing. Subscribers who take the trouble to
do so, can come to the same conclusions
for themselves. All the stocks mentioned
above are monitored in the current
issues of Trendex—and a hundred or so

Chaos in Camera Selling
A hotly-competitive industry
HThe Australian photographic industry
at all levels, manufacturing, whole-
sale and retail, is worried by emerging
trading conditions somewhat akin to
those suffered by the electrical appli-
ance business. It appears that this highly
specialised field, dependent largely on the
amateur, is going the way of many of
our consumer durable goods industries.
One photographic industry authority
described dealings as a “riotous succes-
sion of markups, markdowns, ridiculous
trade-ins, irrational discounting, dis-
orderly trading, and incomprehensible
margins”. It may not be true to describe
the industry (which embraces those who
manufacture and sell everything from
cameras to films and processing, projec-
tors and screens) as being in its infancy.
Certainly it has only discovered the
difficult trading conditions in the past
few years.
Photography has been known as long
in Australia as it has in other parts of
the world, yet until the significant
emergence of the Japanese industry after
the war there had neither been the
supply nor the demand for its products.
Strong competition between both Ger-
many and Japan seems to be the major
cause of the Australian industry’s pre-
sent dilemma.
The Bulletin formed the impression,
after talking to companies on both the
manufacturing and selling sides of the
business, that discounting is its chief
worry. Indeed if one could read minds,
this has reached the stage of virtual
standover tactics. “Some companies, to
stay in business, have been forced to
‘buy up big’ at discounts, in order to
keep their agencies,” one dealer said.
“And to unload their big purchases
they have been obliged to sell at big
discounts, a practice which has knocked
the true retail price of equipment into
a cocked hat.” A survey of Sydney
camera stores revealed equipment,
nationally advertised at a retail price of
£95, selling (new) for £65. Further-
more, the writer could not arrange a
straight swap for a £75 camera (also
new) for the one marked down to £65.
What is happening? Frankly The
Bulletin could not find a concise
answer. There is no real correlation
between the retail price of equipment
here and the cost overseas. For instance,
a camera which cost £75 here is avail-
able in duty free ports for about £3O
to £35. Considering there is no import
duty on cameras and only 25 p.c. sales
tax (which brings the minimum cost up
to about £44), how come they are sold
in Australia for £75?
Answers to this question included
“higher overheads”, “when you buy a
camera overseas you don’t get a guaran-
tee on it”, “the traders in duty-free ports
can afford to work on a two or three p.c.
margin, here we must have 25 p.c. to
keep the business going”. But, as has
been implied before, the industry
here is virtually in its infancy. There
should be a gradual rationalisation of
the business in years to come.
Save for a few items (e.g., still projec-
tors, exposure meters), most of the Aus-
tralian photographic industry is supplied
from overseas. The growing popularity
of photography is noticeable in the fol-
lowing table which sets out the last five
years’ imports of photographic material.

An executive of Hanimex Pty Ltd,
which among its activities includes the
manufacture, import and export of
cameras, slide projectors, films and ex-
posure meters, said the market in Aus-
tralia for photographic material was
growing rapidly. “Although there are
no actual figures to support this I would
say it is going ahead on roughly the
same scale as it is in America and Eng-
land,” he said.
“There the industry has been shown
to be growing at a faster rate than the
gross national product. Compared with
most other overseas markets it is a small
industry in Australia, though here there
is more income spent on photography
than overseas. The interest shown here
in photography has developed only over
the last ten years or so, since the Japan-
ese became a force in the industry.
“And here, as everywhere else, we are
always faced with strong competition.
We sell our products all over the world
and have offices in the UK, Germany
and Canada. We also have buying
offices in Germany and Japan.
“The emphasis nowadays is on bulk
buying. It’s very hard to succeed if
you buy in small lots. Some of the
camera chains now have bulk-buying
facilities which help them meet com-
petition. However, there is a large
amount of confusion among the buying
public as to the true retail price of
equipment and material. Apart from
sometimes tending to injure a product’s
reputation, the lack of retail price main-
tenance can never do the industry good.
“We have been trying for a long time
to get support for a retail price main-
tenance scheme. If such a system were
to work it would have to be perfect and
cover all sides of the industry—a very
hard goal to achieve.”
Strong words on discounting came
from a Sydney suburban photographic
specialist, Kevin Ashton, of Bankstown.
“It goes right back to the manufacturing
side of the business,” he said. “At one
time manufacturers were specialists
confining their production to, only one
type of camera. Now specialisation has
left the game and manufacturers have
branched out into movie cameras, pro-
jectors, meters and so on.
“Consequently there is a lot of pres-
sure on distributors and wholesalers,
especially from Japan, to keep turnovers
up. The only way they can do this is

by offering discounts. The market is so
saturated that some retailers are dis-
counting the wholesale price in the hope
of achieving a larger turnover in order
to provide the profits.
“The situation is not helped, either,
by the tremendous number of cameras
brought into the country by tourists for
a quick profit. Losses caused by the
entry of these cheaply bought cameras
must be made up in some way and dis-
counting is an easy means of doing so.
Some retailers are cutting their margins
back to two or three p.c. so they can
keep up.”
Another photographic dealer, this
time in the city, said business had
reached the stage where some traders
had refused to handle certain lines be-
cause they were forced to buy large
quantities at a discount. “This boycott
has cut so deeply into some manufac-
turers that they are reducing prices in
a few months.
“This will, no doubt, cause further
heartaches and confusion because some
dealers, including myself, have stock at
the old price still unsold.”
Mr Trevor Birchill, Australian general
manager of Dixons Photographic Pty
Ltd, a recent entrant to the Australian
scene, said the market for photographic
equipment was excellent. “Australia is
growing and so is the demand for photo-
graphy. Some dealers are increasing
their sales by 30 p.c. a year. Equip-
ment prices have now reached the level
where people can afford them. For this
reason, and the fact that there is a ready
demand from the amateur, family photo-
grapher, there is a lot more interest
being shown in photography as a
hobby.”
Dixons Australia, wholly owned by
the large UK-based firm of Dixons
International, entered the Australian
market in July last year. Since then it
has opened up and operates seven stores
in NSW and has plans to open in Bris-
bane shortly.
Mr Birchill said the three biggest
problems facing the industry today were
discounting, undercapitalisation, and
lack of technical knowledge on dealers’
parts. “There are many people in the
game today who just do not have the
financial capacity to carry the amount
of stock they do. This, coupled with
technical ignorance, means many of
them are going out of business.
“While they carry large stocks they
must get rid of it somehow, so they re-
sort to discounting. This usually means
they get out of the game quicker. For-
tunately, however, retail price mainten-
ance is still strong in the photographic
trade,” Mr Birchill added.
Biggest in the world field of photo-
graphies is Kodak. A spokesman for
the company in Melbourne, when asked
about Japanese import competition, said
guardedly, “We have a lot of respect for
our competitors, naturally. The demand
for Japanese cameras has doubled since
1958-59.”
Undoubtedly the sales growth of
Kodak’s cameras and projectors in re-
cent years would have been much
greater if imports had not entered so
freely. At present the company is going
all out with its “Instamatic”, which has
been on the market for about 11
months. “The Japanese could make an
appearance at any time,” the spokesman
said, with slight apprehension.
He described the demand for photo-
graphic equipment as “steadily increas-
ing at the present” and felt that this
trend would continue in the future,
barring unforeseen circumstances.
One of the largest importing groups
in Australia is C. R. Kennedy of Mel-
bourne, which has the sole Australian
agency for Asahi Pentax (Japanese) pro-
ducts. Mr J. Viggiano, a spokesman
for the company, said demand for
photographic equipment was expanding
all the time. “Despite the advertising
of all types which has been going on
for 15 years or so it is still considered
that only 12 p.c. to 15 p.c. of the true
potential market has been tapped. The
trade is searching frantically all the time
for something new or revolutionary to
give more impetus to the photography
game. Movie cameras are becoming
more popular, too. Package deals and
television (although it had an initial bad
effect on sales) have caused this inter-
est.”
Generally speaking the photographic
business seems to be more stable in
Melbourne than it is in Sydney. There
is evidence, of course, of discounting,
but not on the same scale as in Sydney.
Melbourne dealers put the stability down
to a more personal relationship between
dealer and customer. The Bulletin
formed the impression that Melburnians
might perhaps receive a little more spe-
cialised treatment than Sydneysiders.
Overall, however, there seems to be a
definite need for a uniformity of tra-
ding conditions throughout Australia.
We can only wait and see what develops.

AGC’s Excellent Results
Directors stress accounting care
tTYie day on which Australian
Guarantee Corporation’s fine interim
report appeared saw the ss. shares slip
back 6d. to 16s. That may in some
manner symbolise the market’s coming
concern with the trend of interest rates
(borrowing costs) and of consumer de-
mand. It should not be allowed to
obscure either AGC’s current perform-
ance or its sure place among the finance
leaders.
Unlike a couple of the other finance
houses which have already commented
on their trading for the December half-
year, there has been no need for AGC
to emphasise any spread away from hire-
purchase. The group has practised bal-
anced diversification over quite a few
years now, as well as being noted for
operational moves into Malaysia and
New Zealand.
Nevertheless, the latest striking ad-
vance in before-tax profits appears to
have largely derived from the hire-
purchase side, particularly motor
vehicles. Net earnings actually reach-
ed £1,083,814 during the December six
months, against £968,781 for the corres-
ponding period of 1963. Tax gave a
big jump from £639,386 to £906,416.
The interim profit represents an
annual earning rate at 25.7 per cent,
compared with 1963-64’s 23.8 per cent
when the full year’s earnings,
£2,011,373, exceeded £2 million for the
first time. A 15 per cent dividend rate
applies for the twelfth successive year.
Group outstandings leapt ahead by
more than £l6 million to £113,726,286,
“the highest yet reported by an Austra-
Han finance company”. The half-year’s
increase is also claimed as “a record for
any finance company in Australia and
for any six months’ period”. Receivables
are subject to deferred income of
£ 13,982,554 (£12,754,243 at June 30,
1964).
The chairman, Colonel H. J. R. Clay-
ton, stresses the group’s usual selectivity
and in addition mentions a fresh pre-
caution taken by the insurance subsidi-
ary, Transport and General Insurance
Co. Ltd. Provision for unearned prem-
iums is now backed by an actuary’s
certificate, stating, inter alia, that “the
provision ... is not less than the prem-
ium which remains to be earned having
regard to the original term and the exact
unexpired terms of each policy”.
As is widely known, AGC’s h.p. un-
earned income has been actuarially
certified since 1962.
Industrial Acceptance Corporation will
probably cap these receivables levels
when reporting for the December period.
That should constitute no detraction
from AGC’s leader status. Investors
were willing to put the shares as high
as 19s. last year.

needed to finance the expansion plans

has at last come to light. Shareholders
and convertible noteholders will parti-
cipate in a one-for-five issue of 20s.
shares at a ss. premium. The last issue
was a one-for-four bonus in 1962-63.
The issue will raise £5l million in
capital. Adding this to the £4l million
worth of notes which will convert at the
end of June this year, it can be seen
that the company's dividend-ranking
capital will be increased by at least
£lO million from June, 1966, on (when
final instalments will be due on the new
shares). In the 1966-67 year, ordinary
dividends will be payable on about
£32 million capital.
With profits rolling in healthily at pre-
sent and expansion plans on hand, main-
taining "about the same rate of dividend
on the increased capital” should not be
too difficult. Last year the payout was
raised from 81- p.c. to 8J p.c. Taking
10 p.c. earnings as adequate, profit in
1966-67 would have to be £3.2 million.
Profit last year was £2.9 million and
on a growing trend. Last week’s issue

announcement accompanied the Interim
report for the December six months—
steady dividend and profits running at
almost £1.6 million, which means that
the £3.2 million needed in 1966-67
could very well be reached in the cur-
rent year. Sales were the highest ever
and are continuing as the group main-
tains its share of an increasing market
despite rising imports.
Briefly, the total £6,875,000 raised
will go on a multi-million pound liner-
board machine due to start production in
1967, increasing capacity at the Botany
mill, doubling capacity at the Port Huon
(Tas.) pulp mill, doing almost the same
at the Geeveston (Tas.) pelletised paper
pulp mill, and establishing a semi-
chemical pulp mill at Maryvale (Vic.).
Fruity Profits
largest jam manufacturer and fruit
A preserving group in the southern
hemisphere, Henry Jones Co-operative,
seems to be doing as well as ever. Profit
in the eleven months to September 30
was £860,500, slightly down from the
£907,900 earned in the previous twelve
months to October 31. Balance dates
of the parent and subsidiaries have now
been brought into line.
As the result was after tax up from
£304.000 to £407,700, it seems that the
overall position may have improved con-
siderably over the year. Last year’s
provision saw the benefit of tax changes
in South Africa to the tune of about
£90,000.
Whether the improvement can be en-
tirely attributed to the benefits of a
change made to the basis of stock valu-
ation by an NZ subsidiary and to the fact
that the results from some subsidiaries
cover a longer period than twelve
months is unknown. These probably
count a lot outside the normal growth
which the group has been undergoing
every year.
A more accurate picture of the 1963-
64 year may be provided by the annual
report. Shareholders will not be overly
concerned anyway, as their steady 10
p.c. dividend is covered by earnings of
29.5 p.c., compared with 32.4 p.c. in the
previous year.

Ampol’s £2l million Lytton refinery,
which is expected to come on stream in
the first half of this year, should show
a satisfactory return on capital by 1967
when operations will be generating funds
sufficient to redeem loan moneys as they
fall due. The first cargo of crude oil is
expected to arrive at the refinery in April.
In his report Mr Thompson said that
by the end of 1967 consumption of
petroleum products in Australia was ex-
pected to increase by 25 p.c. over 1964.
The company's “progressive integration
exemplified in recent years by expansion
into manufacture and refining should
enable us in the future to meet competi-
tion on more even terms,” and “more
successfully increase the range of pro-
ducts we sell, participate in the more
profitable sectors of the industry and to
have greater control over and flexibility
in the products we handle'’. Ampol's ss.
shares are presently available for around
11s. 6d. where the yield from the 14 p.c.
dividend is 6.1 p.c.
Profit Shorn
T ower wool prices in the 1964-65
selling season caused a 12 p.c. drop in
Pitt Son and Badgery's six months profit
to December, directors say in their in-
terim report. Although the quantity of
wool sold was the same as in the previous
corresponding period, the lower level of
prices on wool realisations reduced profit.
The lower result has not affected the
interim dividend which is again 4 p.c.
Total payout for the past six years has
been 13 p.c. including a final 5 p.c.
bonus. Last full year’s profit rose about
29 p.c. to £136.402 to equal 20.4 p.c. on
capital. Even if the 12 p.c. fall continues
for the whole season the company's earn-
ing rate should not fall below 18 p.c.
Its 10s. shares are presently selling for
around 28s. 6d. where the yield from
the dividend is 4.6 p.c. and from earnings
7.1 p.c.
From the Doldrums
Qir Arthur Warner's Electronic In-
dustries may at long last be on the
move. According to the interim report,
profit rose 20 p.c. in the December six
months. Actual figures have not yet
been finalised, but they should provide
interesting reading when released, pos-
sibly in March as with earlier years.
If the 20 p.c. increase is maintained
for the rest of the year, earnings should
come out at about 13.5 p.c. on capital
over the full year. Such a performance

could not help but brighten the shares
and the shareholders. Last year, the
12i p.c. dividend which had been paid
every year since 1948-49 was cut to
10 p.c. when the earnings of 11.3 p.c.
could not cover it. In the three pre-
vious years the payout had been un-
covered anyway.
Although recovery in the current year
will not mean a return to former divi-
dends, because cash must be found for
a programme of expansion and provi-
sion must also be made for the time
when full tax liabilities are incurred (in
about 18 months), it will definitely show
that the group has started a climb from
the doldrums —a climb for which many
investors had given up hope.
Holland Hit
complaints of stiff competi-
tion in the motor vehicle distribu-
tion industry come from Sydney firm
C. V. Holland (Holdings) Ltd, which has
reported a 57.3 p.c. profit drop in the
December half year. The company, a
Holden distributor, also reported a 13.8
p.c. turnover drop.
Directors say the advent of the new
Holden range, due to be released soon,
could help results although competition
will still remain keen. Lower investment
income also contributed to the decline in
earnings. The company has a holding in
Astor Hotel Motels Ltd. In the six
months to December it did not receive a
dividend, compared with a receipt of
about £12,500 in the previous corres-
ponding period.
The market brought C. V. Holland’s
ss. shares to 9s. 6d. where they yield
7.9 p.c.
News from Brambles
As the interim reports come in, so do
the issues. Brambles Industries is
an instance, with the announcement of
substantially increased profit (after
greatly increased tax, interest and de-
preciation provisions) and a one-for-ten
premium issue which will raise £BOO,OOO.
Profit stands at £431,138 for the six
months to December last year compared
with £361,334 for the previous cor-
responding period. It remains after tax
of £312,000 (previous comparable period
£100,000), depreciation and amortisation
£594,426 (£455,441), directors’ fees
£5125 (£4000), and debenture and fixed
term loan interest of £48,116 (£10,678).
The share issue, which will raise
£319,581 capital and £479,371 premium,
Is payable in full on application. Total
application price is 12s. 6d. Current
price for the company’s ss. shares is
18s. 6d. On the ordinary capital which
becomes £3,515,391 after the issue, the
directors expect to maintain the present
15 p.c. dividend.
Into Hot Water
Kelite Industries has made
good use of some of the funds it
has on hand for acquisition and other
expansionary purposes. A controlling
75 p.c. interest has been bought in South
Australia’s largest manufacturer of hot
water services, Beasley Industries, a
proprietary company.
Last July, 80 p.c. of Commando Pro-
ducts, another SA company, was pur-
chased. This company makes chemical
water softening and treatment equip-
ment. Although based in Melbourne,
the Gibson group is becoming big in
SA. A subsidiary making industrial
chemicals is also based there, as well as
another acting as a glazier and shop-
fitter.
The Beasley move also increases the
importance of the group’s hot water
engineering activities. Orm Smith, an-
other subsidiary, is already doing very
well in this field in NSW and Victoria.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
High Yielders Back into Favor?
A. G. Healing's rather brighter prospects
Tf, as some suggest, the high yielding
stocks are likely to come back into
favor, A. G. Healing Ltd does not seem
to be a good example. During the
course of the 1965 year the shares have
varied between Bs. 6d. and 7s. and
are currently selling around 7s. 3d. This
price is very close to the all-time low
for the group as it stands today, i.e., as
a merger of A. G. Healing and A. E.
Goodwin. Despite the favorable an-
nouncements that have been made,
namely the sale of R. and G. Finance
Pty Ltd to Mutual Acceptance and the
receipt of the £7 million contract of the
New South Wales Government Railways
by A. E. Goodwin, investors seem to
be losing their confidence in the stock.
It could be that the price is coming
under some selling pressure because of
the sale of 363,868 Healing shares out
of A. E. Goodwin’s holding to acquire
Westcott Hazell and Co. Ltd in Sep-
tember, 1963, and by the subsequent
disposal, apparently, of a further
207,000 approximately. No informa-
tion seems to have been given about
the sale of these shares. Judging by the
dividends received during 1963-64 by
“a subsidiary company”, the sales were
made before June 30, 1964, but after
the payment of the 1962-63 final divi-
dend in December, 1963. It therefore
seems likely that this sale was in con-
nection with the purchase of A. W.
Fairfax Ltd. However, it is clear from
the balance sheet as at June 30, 1964,
that only 422,000 shares approximately
remain.
The merger with A. E. Goodwin
took place just after the close of the
1959- year, following the acquisition
by A. E. Goodwin of the Healing
family's holding in A. G. Healing. In
the five years prior to this merger, the
shares of A. G. Healing had varied
between 17s. and 10s. 6d. The divi-
dend rate had been maintained at 15
p.c. although ordinary capital had been
increased by 50 p.c. in November, 1958,
by a one-for-two rights issue at par.
The following table shows, in percentage
form, the effect of the merger based on
the balance sheets as at June 30, 1960
and 1961, and the profit and loss
accounts for the years 1959-60 and
1960-
Current Current assets -f- 92%
liabilities + 160% Interest on long-
Net working term debt + 98%
capital + 54% Depreciation and
Fixed assets + 109% amortisation -f- 40%
Total capital -j- 199% Tax provision + 24%
Loan capital + 44% Earnings + 150%
Ordinary Ord. dividends -j- 205%
capital 205% Surplus -j- 20%
Reserves -j- 89%
This table only serves to indicate that
the combined group was very much
bigger than the old A. G. Healing and
that the biggest increase occurred in
ordinary capital and dividends. Size-
able increases also occurred in current
liabilities and the interest charge on
fixed loans, and it seems possible that
these problems have remained. This
would certainly make a reason for the
disposal of R. and G. Finance. So far
as it is possible to make out from the
latest balance sheet, A. G. Healing was
faced with the refunding of just about
£2.7 million during 1964-65, though it
is only fair to point out that as at
June 30, 1963, it appeared that
£l.B million had to be repaid during
1963-64. In fact, short-term liabilities
totalling only £524,000 seem to have
been repaid, but £150,000 of this would
appear to have been met out of an 8
p.c. unsecured note due to be repaid
on June 30, 1965.
Tt would seem, then, that the sale of
R. and G. Finance will relieve A. G.
Healing of this burden. Judging by the
price that has been paid for the equity
and goodwill of the business (£75,000),
it was not a major profit earner. This
would suggest that earnings could im-
prove by approximately £lOO,OOO with-
out any increase in earnings from
elsewhere, provided the assumption that
funds are not needed to finance other
activities is a correct one. Even assu-
ming that the current year will not bene-
fit from the acquisitions of Westcott
Hazell and A. W. Fairfax, the earning
rate could increase to nearly 20 p.c.
There are two factors in particular
which could mean that this figure will
not be achieved. Firstly, full tax was
not paid on 1963-64 profits, for, in the
preliminary announcement, it was stated
that “Lower taxation provision for the
year under review resulted from utilisa-
tion of tax losses of previously acquired
subsidiary companies.” It may be that
this saving was of the order of £90,000.
Secondly, ordinary capital could be in-
creased by about £163,000 if the
options outstanding in A. E. Goodwin’s
shares are converted. This would re-
present a 5.7 p.c. increase in ordinary
capital and would effect a corresponding
reduction in the earning rate.
If, then, A. G. Healing pays full tax
and these options convert in 1964-65,

the earning rate of 20 p.c. which I have
suggested as possible could be reduced
to only 16.8 p.c., or just about to the
1963-64 level.
While the market’s caution can thus
be understood, it does seem unrealistic
to have marked the shares down to
current levels at a time when the pros-
pects look rather brighter than they have
done since the group’s refunding pro-
blem became apparent about twelve
months ago. Clyde Industries is usu-
ally regarded as A. E. Goodwin’s major
competitor and, while other activities
differ, it may not be unreasonable to
compare the share prices and yields of
the two companies:
Earn-
Div. Div. ings
Last rate yield yield
Company High Low sale % % %
Clyde Inds. 13/- 12/- 12/1 15 6.2 9.3
A. G. Healing 8/6 7/6 7/9 12 7.8 10.7
It might be as well to point out that
a rise in .the price of Healing’s shares
to 9s. is necessary to bring the earnings
yield into line with that of Clyde. This
would still leave the dividend yield at
6.7 p.c. It can be expected that, having
reduced the rate of dividend from 15
p.c. to 12 p.c. in 1962-63, Healing's
board will seek to reinstate the 15 p.c.
rate as soon as it is possible to do so.
This means that prospects of an increase
in the dividend yield are rather better
from Healing than they are from Clyde.
A. G. Healing’s shares, therefore, are
probably reasonable buying up to, say,
10s.

Sad World for Brokers
Interim reports bring some sunshine
At least the interim reports are begin-
ning to cast a few rays of sunshine
into the investment gloom. Things seem
to be so bad in the broking world that
I’ve practically had to nurse my sob-
bing broker’s head in my hands. And
I’m afraid that all this talk of revising
rates of commission might drive him
into doing something quite desperate.
Mind you, I have a feeling that the
operative word about new brokerage
rates might be “revised” as opposed to
“reduced”. Those who have been clam-
oring for lower rates of commission
might well find that they have been
playing right into the hands of the big
investors the institutions at the
expense of small investors. Time will
no doubt tell.
As to the market, brokers seem to be
whiling away the time trying to explain
the market’s blues. Could it be that
shares just haven't been a very good in-
vestment these past few years? The plain
fact is that ever since 1960 the aver-
age investor has not done well in shares.
Take my mother-in-law (what a marvel-
lous idea), for example. For the most
part her money is in ACI, BHP, David
Jones, etc., all of which have failed to
produce capital gains in the last couple
of years.
Admittedly a number of small com-
panies have done well Paynter and
Dixon, Keith Harris, Hanimex, Burns
Consolidated, Protector, Hestia, Mar-
tin Wells, and others. But the average
investor probably hasn't had many, if
any, shares like these. Nor has he had
much money in mining shares like
Norths and Souths, not to mention Reni-
son. These have been for the traders
and speculators. In other words, the last
few years have served to make out a
strong case for short-term trading rather
than long-term investment. Speculate
or perish, they say, and I’m glad my
editors have made me subscribe to that
policy.
But I digress. The interim reports, as
I began to say some paragraphs back,
have been a source of comfort. Profit
increases have not just been “satisfac-
tory” but “good” and even “substantial”
in many cases. Admittedly the first
reports are supposed to be the best,
yet they are representative of too many
different industries to be the exception
rather than the rule.
One interim report that prompted me
into action was from Austral Motors,
the Queensland motor distributor. Profit
last year was up from £197,000 to
£289,000 to give an earning rate of 22.6
p.c. However, directors did not let this
go to their heads and just gave the
dividend a modest lift from 10 p.c. to
121 p.c. The tax provision of £286,000
(up from £148,000) indicated that things
were even better than they looked.
Despite this the shares stayed around
the Bs. mark. Then along came the in-
terim report last week with news of a
further substantial” increase in sales
and profits.
All this stems from the fact that
Austral Motors has a strong hand in
terms of franchises Chrysler, Rootes
Toyota, among others. Chrysler
continues to thrive with the the
Imp has put Rootes back on its feet,
while Toyota is the best-selling Japanese
car in Australia. AH this convinced me
to buy 400 Austral Motors at Bs. sd.
So much for the interim reports. The
December production statistics also
revealed an interesting point or two. I’d
been watching television set production
climb steadily by an average of about 25
p.c. for some months. Then, in Decem-
ber, production shot up by 54 p.c. over
the figure for the previous December.
And Pye's shares continued to weaken!
Pve should be the pick of the television
stocks, because not only is TV its best-
selling line but also those very hefty bad
debts which arose in the dark days of
1961-62 should now be fully written off.
So I bought 200 Pye at 235. 6d.
Now, just to show that I’m not becom-
ing an optimist, I finished up the week
with another bit of shorting. Mount Isa.
This, of course, is one I should have
shorted at 40s. Instead, I did so last
week when the price recovered from
355. 6d. to 375. 6d. Maybe I’m a bit
late and the strike might even be over
by the time this is in print. On the other
hand it may not. And even if it is,
Mount Isa’s result for the year will
already have been dealt a nasty blow.
Details of the week’s transactions
were:—
BOUGHT
400 Austral Motors, Bs. 3d £173
200 Pve Industries, 235. 6d £240
SOLD SHORT
200 Mt Isa, 375. 6d. £370
These transactions brought my un-
committed cash down to £276. In addi-
tion I’m short in three stocks CSR,

hold a put option on United Telecasters.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Italians and Wool Stability
Concealed support for acquisition
TThtE views of Italian manufacturers on
wool selling methods, as reported
by Desmond O’Grady from Rome
(Bulletin, January 16), will give all
woolgrowers food for thought.
The Italians say they want price
stability and not a reserve price. This
would appear to be a contradiction,
because price stability is one of the very
planks upon which the reserve price
plan put forward by the Wool Board is
built.
Section (1) of the summary of recom-
mendations says (among other things): A
reserve price will bring a measure of
stability to wool prices and income for
growers and other sections of the trade.
Over and above that, both Sir William
Gunn, Wool Board chairman, and Mr
W. J. Vines, International Wool Secre-
tariat managing director, have been
stressing that the industry needs price
stability badly and that the reserve price
plan is the way to obtain it.
Certainly there is a shade of differ-
ence between “stability” and a “measure
of stability”. But Sir William has, many
times, pointed out that the reserve price
plan is a conservative change from the
present free auction system and that it
is, therefore, feasible. With few excep-
tions most reserve price supporters go
along with this. The exceptions are
those who want straight-out acquisition
now.
Apparently, from Desmond O’Grady’s
article, the Italian manufacturing in-
dustry wants acquisition also. That is the
only way for one to interpret their
suggestion that “standard prices for the
different grades of wool, with the ex-
ception of superfines, to be set by a
Government-sponsored authority for a
year at a time, or for longer periods if
possible”.
The making of an exception in the
case of superfines is interesting and, in
a way, must cause some cynicism. The
Italians are the heaviest buyers of super-
fines. Why make an exception for them?
Whatever the reason, it is highly un-
likely that Australian woolgrowers, or
the Wool Board, would agree to making
exceptions for any grades of wool in any
marketing change. What the Italian
buyers must know, and all others in fact,
is that all the possible marketing systems
so far put up have one thing in common:
removal of the initiative in setting the
prices from the buyers to the growers.
The growers want to call the tune. All
the talk of international goodwill and
benefits for the wool industry as a whole
do not alter this basic attitude.
To get back to the main point of the
Italian proposal-namely, that an acqm-
sition system of marketing would be bet-
ter than reserve price. The drawback to
acquisition, as far as its feasibility goes,
15 t h , a V a WO a ”', pe t °“! the ,ong ;
established, and mostly highly-respected,
broking houses It ,s necessary to be
sensible about this kind of thing.
A ehange to acquisition would be no
eas y thing. Too many Australians have
shares in nastoral houses ton minv
snares m pastoral nouses, too many
woolgrowers have strong loyalties to the
s, to ° man Y broking houses are
enormous property owners and wool-
§ rowers themselves. If it could be
proved that they were inefficient, cor-
rupt and generally moribund, there
would be a case. Can that be proved?
This writer believes it cannot.
Lik e everyone else the brokers have
t heir faults, yet as a segment of the
Australian commercial world their re-
cord j s better than many others.
Besides, under acquisition, wool could
bought by people other than genuine
manufacturers and could be held, in
$t and re]eased in times when de _
mand was strong. It is difficult to see
how this kind of trafficking could be
stopped unless sales were on a Govern-
ment-to-Government basis (e.g., wheat
to China). The point is that, while re-
serve prices might not provide complete
stability, there is no guarantee that com-
plete stability would be provided by
acquisition either—except on a Govern-
ment-to-Government basis.
It is true that there is a second form
of acquisition which might permit an
authority to acquire wool from the
grower at fixed prices and sell it by
auction to the buyers. This is a some-
what theoretical method and only in the
United Kingdom, where woolgrowing is
an entirely different industry, has any-
thing approaching this method been
tried. It is in existence, in a form,
though it must be remembered that, like
every other UK primary industry, wool-
growing is highly subsidised. Besides,
it is a minor UK primary industry.
On the other hand, acquisition at a
fixed price and sales at negotiated or
quoted prices was, in substance, the
method of selling the Australian clip
during World War ll—during the war
years, that is. The system was con-
tinued for a few years after hostilities
ceased on, more or less, a reserve price
basis. South Africa and New Zealand
continued with it. Australia scrapped it.
Therefore both acquisition and re-
serve price have been tried in Australia
and each, in its way, worked. Each is
feasible economically, but one, acquisi-
tion, has grave implications which many
people, correctly, would call outright
socialism.
It could be cynically suggested that
it is just possible the Italian industry
knows all about this, and knows full
well that, while a reserve price plan
might come into being in Australia, an
acquisition plan would split the country
wide open.

Looking at the thing on a long-term
basis —say 50 years—it is possible to see
that reserve price might eventually lead
to acquisition. But only if reserve price
fails to work.
Opponents of reserve price (and
naturally acquisition) have made much of
the claim that the reserve price advo-
cates are socialists under the skin and
are really using reserve price purely as
a stepping stone to acquisition.
Is there real evidence to substantiate
this?
As there are at least a few wool-
growers who have, either in speeches or
in letters to various publications, ex-
pressed this fear, it would be not un-
reasonable to ask for a definite answer
on this point from both Sir William
Gunn and Mr Vines. Each has, on occa-
sions, made remarks which might be
construed as support for a Government
acquisition scheme.
Mr Vines’ New Year message to his
IWS staff sounds very much like a
veiled plea for acquisition. As with so
much IWS public-relations handout
material, it is also vague and evasive in
areas where it should be quite specific.
If Mr Vines favors acquisition he should
say so—now.
LETTER
Promotion without Marketing
More questions for Mr Vines
Sir,
Mr Vines, writing in “Man On The
Land”, January 9, and replying to criti-
cism of the Woolmark plan, makes state-
ments that do not appear to have any
resemblance to known facts.
He states that “Details of ex-
penditure are also known to the Austra-
lian Wool Industry Conference . . . No
one can argue that the growers are not
in effective control of expenditure”. The
executive of the AWIC may have the
very barest of details but the 50 man
AWIC itself would get practically nil.
The executive of the AWIC might get
the same details as a company’s share-
holders get at an annual meeting (which
is almost nil), but the difference is that
the full AWIC is virtually the grower's
directors, not just the shareholders.
Again, Mr Vines states that there is no
“handout” to manufacturers. Whether
or not there is any difference between a
“handout” and “assistance” is proble-
matical, but will either Mr Vines or Sir
William Gunn deny that our large re-
tailers are “assisted” with five-figure
amounts for advertising? Furthermore,
would either of these persons deny that
a Brisbane firm that is very much “assis-
ted” by the Wool Board with advertising
turned in very good profit figures last
year and on a percentage basis would
have made three or four times the nor-
mal earnings percentage of any wool-
grower? If the assistance provided by
growers on marginal incomes had been
deducted, this firm’s profit figures would
not have been nearly so rosy.
Mr Vines really touches the bottom,
however, when he states “For the first
time we have funds and a plan which,
given time . . . will maintain an economic
price for Australian wool”.
As a grower who has already paid
£738 10s. 3d. for promotion levy on
wool that has not been sold but has been
sent overseas for sale (levy has to be
paid before wool can be shipped) I
wonder when our promotion experts will
tell us facts that will stand up to ex-
amination in the future.
Growers in spite of their very short
memories will doubtless recall both Sir
William Gunn and Mr Vines telling us 14
months ago that the prices that were
ruling then were the kind we could expect
with promotion. Today prices are over
20 p.c. down, but, given time, we can ex-
pect an economic price!
In the “report to woolgrowers”, Gunn
states: “When woolgrowers agreed to the
10s. levy in 1961 confidence in the UK
immediately increased; granting of the
present proposals for more promotion
will create greater confidence.”
However, in 1961 our wool prices fell
almost continuously from June to Decem-
ber in spite of record consumption
and exactly the same pattern has been in
evidence this time. After the additional
promotion money was granted last Janu-
ary, prices for wool rose for about six
weeks. Since that date there has been a
continuous decline in prices. This time
wool consumption has dropped a little,
though mainly in crossbred types. Known
stocks of Merino wool are at very, very
low levels, but prices are down 20 p.c.
Promotion without marketing will con-
tinue to be a failure. Our wool market
will undoubtedly rise. When is un-
known, as it should never have fallen
to where it is today. When the market
does rise, no doubt our promotion ex-
perts will take full credit for the rise.
When the next fall comes, the promotion
experts will probably disappear overseas
—at our expense for a while.
Promoting wool as we are at present,
with no fixed price or no fixed minimum
price, is utterly stupid.
Let me close by stating that wool
promotion is necessary. It is a waste of
the woolgrowers’ and taxpayers’ money
until such time as the woolgrowers have
a marketing scheme in operation.
