The Schoolmaster All Abroad
i Nineteen-twentieths of my blameless life
ot 50 years has been spent in schools. I
commenced in a Grade I (30 pupils and a
fledge schoolmaster) as the wide-eyed desk
mate of three dear little things in spotless
pinnies. 1 am now laboring up the strait
toward superannuation (five years to go and
do completed) as the presiding Jove of
an institution handling on mass-production
lines some /00 of the young of the human
species.
I feel that I ought to know something
about education. As a matter of fact, I hold
a University parchment illegibly signed by
the chief magistrate of this Dominion, which
says that I do. Yet I am in the throes of
a devastating agnosticism. . Only the
theologian is more sceptical about his call-
ng than the pedagogue. Only the theo-
ogian has the same array of second-rate
literature regarding the principles and tecli-
“qu® °. f , hls calling from which to draw
rhat cold comfort he can.
Still, the profession, apart from some
raitors, champions its own pretension. Per
ontra writers outside my chosen calling

ng, Charles Dickens, G. 8.5., Miss Bronte
t ley all do it. By comparison the
immon hangman comes off lightly from
ie merciless inquisition to which genius
lbmits the doings of its contemporaries.
Does genius know? As my own theory
that genius alone knows—that it alone
tuitively grasps the real significance of
nng and striving^- 1 am compelled to
lmit that its arraignment of the shortcom-
gs of my colleagues and myself is pro-
undly disquieting. What is wrong with

itself and capriciously susceptible to
ance influences.
All true teachers suffer from an uneasy
nscience. They endeavor to manipulate
plexus of instincts, of feelings, of imagin-
es and desires that is incalculably van-
le. Diagnosis and treatment is all too
’quently at fault. Hence pedagogical
f-mortlfication. Hence also the warning
en all beginners to forget the tribulations

have its 250,000 offspring educated for a
beggarly £4,000.000 per annum
(3) What is the remedy? Though
eoietical socialist I have become an indi-
vidualist in education. Education (God
lelp the truth that is also a platitude!) is
nothing if it is not, individual. Individual-
ism can never abide systems. So System
must go Its regimental tyranny and
sterile subservience have blighted the pro-
mise of millions of minds already. Its un-
bending and conscientious endeavors to
jam left-hand feet into right-hand shoos is
he crime against the Holy Ghost—l mean
the living soul breathed into Adam, Eve
and their teeming progeny of five thousand
generations.
I hesitate to say that schooling must
become a retail trade plied by hucksters in
tiny booths. That way lies penury and
economic servitude. jßut I do say that
schools and classes must be small, that
educationists with a vocation must be en-
dowed and that they must b 6 left unhin-
dered to divine and evoke the possibilities
oi each mind and heart entrusted to their
charge. I repeat, education is moulding per-
sonalities—not obliterating them by mass
instruction. The process is expensive, but
I cannot help that. If it be remembered
that given real schools our ■whole civilisa-
tion could be run down and re-cast into
something worthier of our age. that from
the schools could emerge a true democracy,
that the destiny of these lands we live in
will, a generation hence, pass into the cus-
tody of those atoms of humanity at present
m their schools, the cost will not seem too
great.
COMMENCIS II.
Our Only Freetrade Industry
According to “1.L.” (R.P. 25/6/’3O), an
Australian publisher persuaded Dr Charle
MacLaurin to send his works to London
where he “achieved a world-wide succes
which he could never have done had he
published here.” Asa matter of fact we
lave no publishers—only booksellers who
do a little publishing as a side-line In
any case publishing here would not have
debarred Dr. MacLaurin from publishing
m London and New York. Hundreds of
famish and American authors are now pub-
lishing simultaneously in London and New
*L°. ar *d dumping their remainders on us
Neither would publishing in Australia have
robbed him of “world fame.” Look at
Henry Lawson. The objection to publishing
iiere is that, in the present state of the
trade, it does not pay except in the case
oi exceptional books with an exclusively
Australian appeal. (“Here’s Luck” is a case
in point.) The competition of the favored
overseas product is too strong. I knew
Dr. MacLaurin well, and what his local
profits were. He had made about £ls from
Australian sales shortly before his death!
u y j® news to me that the ladies who wrota
‘A House Is Built” tried to get their book
Published in Sydney, and failed. If so, it is
only another proof of the hopeless state oi'
tr rf e - “ A House Is Built,” unlike
Post Mortem.” was an obvious best-seller
m Australia. But I fancy “IX.” is mis-
taken. The authors called on me shortly
after winning The Buleethst prize, and at
that |mie they certainly had no idea of pub-
lishing anywhere but in London. I wrote
t°my agent, John Farquherson, on their
behalf at the time. What they have made
<?r r t * ieir Australian royalties, which
I.L. says “have not been beneath their
notice, Ido not know, having heard nothing
ol them since the visit mentioned above.
But it is possible to make a rough guess.
If 5000 copies of “A Hoqse Is Built” were
sold here—and the sale was probably less
they would have earned £62 10s. between
them!
Australian writers are paid on this star-
vation basis because British and American
writers are content to regard any Australian
sales they may have as “baksheesh.’
British writers of best-sellers, such as Gilbert
Frankau, have told me so.
If Australia passed a copyright law on
all fours with the American one, which
requires every novel circulating in the
L.S.A.. to be set up there, printed on
Amercian paper and bound in America
cloth, an immediate result would be tha
Australian authors, in common with over
seas authors, would become entitled to fai
royalties.
But this question is not primarily the
concern of Australian writers, whose best
markets are going to be Britain and the
U.S.A. for many years whatever happen*
It is a national question: a plain probleir
m industrialism. The book trade is as
much a natural Australian industry as tha
sheep trade. We are the world’s greatest
readers per head of population. Protective
legislation would no more prevent the
leading of books than it, has prevented the
wearing of hats. Its only effect would be
to bring the world’s great publishers here.

It takes all
Australia to build
these famous cars
UTHORITIES agree on
the value of increased
national production. Nowhere
is such increase more noteworthy
to-day than among those Aus-
tralian industries linked by a
common aim with Australia’s lead-
ing builder of motor cars.
All over Australia, skilled
workers in many trades and
callings participate —in timber
camp and sawmill and sheep
station, in mine and factory, in
workshop and laboratory. As a
result, a steadily rising tide of
Australian - produced material
flows into the five great assembly
plants of General Motors Aus-
tralia.
Consider the Australian bodies
tor General Motors cars. They
are built by Australians in one of
the world’s largest body-building
plants. Their production calls
for finest Australian hardwoods—
leather and broadcloth from Aus-
tralian hides and wool Aus-
tralian - produced bolts, nails,
screws, hardware, and Duco.
Each of these materials is a pro-
duct of one or more Australian
industries, employing Australian
labour.
Again, consider the Australian-
built tyres and tubes and bat-
teries, bumpers, paint, and primer,
which find their way to General
Motors assembly lines. All are
products of Australia.
Here are facts: General Motors
Australia requires more Aus-
tralian materials than any other
car builder. Its operations help
to support more than 20,000
Australian workers. Since 1926,
General Motors has expended
in Australia.
That is why to purchase General
Motors Australian products is to
help Australia grow. And
ownership, as proved by 100,000
General Motors cars and trucks
now serving Australia, carries
national as well as individual
progress still further forward—
through better transport.

JOHN DALLEY.
Kendalliana— (III)
Kendall wrote that he purposed to write
“not songs, like some, tormented and awry
with passion”; and held to his purpose.
The strong human, emotions are rarely
expressed in his poetry. Twice only, in
“Rose Lorraine” and in the masquerade of
“A Spanish Love Song,” he strikes an
erotic note. Verses attributed to his mother
refer to the “great first loye” inspiring
these poems: a love “that could never be
conquered by time.”
The heroine was Rose Bennett, daughter
of Samuel Bennett, part-proprietor of the
“Empire” and proprietor of the “Evening
News.” There is a well-supported tradition
that Kendall was engaged to many this
young lady during some months in 1867.
He seemed then quite a desirable candi-
date for a matrimonial alliance. Good-
looking, well dressed, lively and romantic,
holding a place in the Colonial Secretary’s
office at £2OO a year, and with the laurels
of a “native Australian poet” green on his
brow, Kendall at 27 was attractive to girls
of the period.
They quarrelled; the engagement was
broken; and Rose Bennett married the
pushing English canvasser for the “Town
and Country Journal,” associated with the
“Evening News” under the Bennett pro-
prietary. This was Henniker Heaton, who
presently took his wife to England, where
he became a member of the House of Com-
mons and gained credit as a postal reform-
er. Quite a notable personage, indeed. His
life, written by his daughter, refers to the
early association with Kendall in terms
laudatory to the poet.
And Kendall, in 1867, lectured—some-
what satirically, it is said—upon “Love,
Courtship and Marriage,” and was intro-
duced to the lady who in 1868 became
his wife—Miss Charlotte Rutter, daughter
of a Sydney doctor of medicine. In 1869
Kendall published “Leaves from Australian
Forests,” with the lines to “Rose Lor-
raine” :
No woman lives with power to burst
My passion’s bonds, and set me free,
For Rose is last where Rose was first,
And only Rose is fair to me.
The faintest memory of her face,
The wilful face that hurt me so,
Is followed by a fiery trace
That Rose Lorraine must never know.
I keep a faded ribbon string
You used to wear about your throat;
And of this pale, this perished thing
I think I know the threads by rote.
God help such love! To touch your hand,
To loiter where your feet might fall,
You marvellous girl! my soul would stand
The worst of Hell —its fires and all.
In his married man’s “Spanish Love Song”
Kendall goes farther into the region of
amorous longing:—
You first, you last, you false love!
In dreams your lips I kiss ;
And thus I greet your Shadow,
"Take this! and this! and this!”
When dews are on the casement,
And winds are in the pine,
I have you close beside me-
in sleep your mouth is mine.
I never see you elsewhere ;
You never think of me ;
But fired with fever for you
• Content I am to be.
You will not turn, my darling!
Nor answer when I call;
But yours are soul and body
And love of mine and all.
You splendid Spaniard ! Listen !
ily passion leaps to flame
For neck, and cheek, and dimple,
And cunning shades of shame:
I tell you, I would gladly
Give Hell myself to keep,
To cling to, half a moment,
The lips I taste in sleep 1
Henry and his Rose were two petulant
persons; and a legend of their parting was
recovered by Louisa Lawson when she
came to Sydney in 1884, two years after
Kendall’s death. The legend declares that
Miss Rose was a passenger on the train
which went to open a new railway section—
possibly the line to Mittagong—in March,
1867, and Master Henry came to the
station at Redfern to see her gallantly
off—not himself being a passenger. They
exchanged affection through the carriage
window, till Rose dropped her gay parasol
out of the window and said:—
“Pick that up, Harry!”
Harry said: “Say please.”
Rose said: “Pick that up, Harry 1”
Harry said: “Say please.”
Rose wouldn’t say please; the train moved
off, and, though Harry ran after the moving
carriage with the parasol, Rose had taken
the huff and Harry had accepted the huff,
and the rift widened to a final parting.
Kendall dedicated his Melbourne book of
poems to his wife:—
Who, when I thought all light was out, became
A lamp of hope that put my fears to shame;
Who faced for love’s sole sake the life austere
That waits upon the man of letters here;
Who, unawares, her deep affection showed
By many a touching little wifely mode;
Whose spirit, self-denying, dear, divine,
Its sorrows hid, so it might lessen mine;
To her, my bright best friend, I dedicate
This book of rhymes—’twill help to compensate
For much neglect.
And it is recorded that Kendall. died with
an arm around his wife’s'heck.

Rogue Herries
Hugh Walpole’s latest novel, Rogue
Hcrries (Macmillan), sets forth the his-
tories of a man from youth to extreme old
age, and of three of his offspring from
childhood to middle age. It is a monu-
mental work of over 700 pages, yet there
is not a dull passage in it.
Primarily it concerns Francis Herries,
lecher, brawler, dreamer and neurotic, who
is never so bad as his neighbors imagine,
and who manages “to change body into
soul” in the end. The character of this fan-
tastic hero is observed with an Olympian
detachment and insight so that not a word
he says rings false. We know the Rogue
as we know the Egoist. Every society and
age has such men, but it takes a very
sincere and profound student of humanity
to bring them to life in print. There is a
vast gallery of portraits of the Herries
family. The social life of England’s
squirearchy in the second half of the
eighteenth century is described without the
slightest consideration for the genteel feel-
ings of Australia’s Mr. Forde, and there
are some lovely descriptions of the Cum-
berland .country which the author knows so
\yell.
A great book, fragrant with the atmo-
sphere of England’s northern lakes and
moors.
A Satchel of Books
The Life of Our Lord, by Reginald Pon-
sonby (Bell). The story has been compiled
from the Gospels, arranged to make a con-
tinuous narrative. Admirably done.
Oddways, by Herbert Adams (Methuen).
Two brothers are murdered at the same
hour, in the same manner, but at widely dif-
ferent places. As usual, Scotland Yard fails
the nation, and the mystery is unveiled by
the usual outsiders, assisted by the customary
female with Sex Appeal. Mr. Adams runs
Edgar Wallace close in his output of this
class of merchandise.
Lewis Cox’s The Thousandth Man (Mills
and Boon) gets this tribute from the blurb-
writer :—
The story is described with great ability and
reality, and the fiction reader who does not read
this novel is missing a great treat.
Those who like that kind of writing will like
the book, which is about Geoff, a London
youth who finds his long-lost mother doing
a song-and-pattcr turn in an East End hall
and finishes by marrying a nice girl.
Three of Them, by Norman Douglas
(Chatto and Windus). The title is one of
desperation. The book’s first item is a
roving account of the writer’s visit to Athens
a year or so ago, with dips into the Greek
anthology and other flashes of the author
at his grandest. Item two is the brilliant,
penetrating, feeling study of encroaching
lunacy called “Nerinda,” a beautiful short
story in the Edgar Allen Poe humor. Item
three is a paper on “The Herpetology of the
Grand Duchy of Baden.” The “Three” are
really three arresting facets of a clear
genius.
The Cripple in Black , by E. V. Timms
(Cornstalk Publishing Co.), is a novel of
revenge as practised in the seventeenth cen-
tury. The action begins in Genoa, where
Balsamo, the rich and noble-minded cripple,
is robbed of his adored Marie by the in-
famous Lord Castlehaven. Later, the charac-
ters meet in the London of Charles II., and
horror is piled on horror’s head till such
time as virtue triumphs and vice meets its
deserts. The characters live in their melo-
dramatic fashion, and there are some pic-
turesque sidelights on the area round .St.
Paul’s as it was three centuries ago. The
author is a young Australian, who does most
of his work in Sydney.
Lorenzo the Magnificent, by David Loth
(Routledge), is written with a pagan, or at
least irreligious, gusto, which matches the
times, the manners and the men, including
that Medici rightly called the Magnificent.
While it will doubtless offend the suscepti-
bilities of those who believe churches were
always what they are to-day, it should brightly
entertain all not so afflicted, and especially
those who like their story from life spiced
and served piping hot. The writer’s banter-
ing style wears a* little forced at times, but
there is humor, the narrative is never dull,
and the people are always, or mostly, some-
thing more than puppets. The picture of
fifteenth-century Italy reads like a rather
true caricature. Biography with a kick
in it.
The Ayesha: A Great Adventure, by H.
von Mticke (Philip Allan). Describing the
Sydney-Emden scrap, the writer says: “The
conflict, which had begun at about eight-
thirty in the morning, ended at six o’clock
in the evening.” As the editor, J. G. Lock-
hart, points out, the first salvo was fired
at 9.40 a.m.; the Emden ran aground at
11.30 a.m. Other mild contradictions have
to be made of Von Miicke’s account of the
happenings at Cocos Keeling, where he was
put ashore with a landing-party from the
Emden to destroy the wireless plant, and
where the party was left when the Emden
put out to engage the Sydney. The rest of
the book, describing how, in tbe small sailing
craft Ayesha, the party found its way into
the Red Sea, thence overland to Turkey and
Germany, rings true enough; but then so
would the earlier part but for the editorial
interjections. Still, even if all the trimmings
are invention, the central adventure makes
a stirring yarn.

“J.E.P.”: “Ex-Tas.” is a bit astray in his
facts about “Australia’s first novel,”
“Quintus Servington” (R.P. 21/5/’30). The
author, Henry Savary, was not one of the
garrison. A wealthy sugar-baker of Bristol,
he was a notable figure there until a matter
of forgery, in 1825, brought him a death
sentence, commuted . to. transportation for
life. Savary was shipped to Tasmania, where
he was employed as a writer in a Govern-
ment department. “Quintus Servington.”
published in 1830, is said to be an authentic
memoir ;of his domestic and ill-starred
career.

“RATIONING” WONT SAVE US.
Every few months we get hold of a new
catchword to roll lovingly on the tongue
and save us the trouble of thinking. Early
this year we made fine play with “mobil-
ised”; credit had to be mobilised and gold
had to be mobilised and bank reserves had
to be mobilised, and on that foundation
the scheme for a Central Reserve Bank
was built, and we weren’t expected to poke
into details. Now we are giving “ration-
ing” a turn; it is our blessed word Mesopo-
tamia, which is relied upon to put all argu-
ment out of the question.
Not, of course, that rationing is always
and in all circumstances a bad thing. In
its proper place it is a most common-
sensible thing—which is probably the reason
why we have hitherto avoided it. When
there are 20 loaves to divide and 20 people
to divide them among, no tribunal in the
world can hand out a loaf and a half apiece
to those 20 people. Our arbitration courts,
directed more or less in this matter by our
legislatures, have, however, refused to take
the number of loaves into account : they
have said that the people ought to have a
loaf and a half, and a loaf and a half they
must have whether there is enough pro-
duced to go round or not. The rationing
of the product of labor is a good thing:
our attempt to fix wages on some other
basis is responsible for our present difficul-
ties. The unemployed are merely the un-
fortunates who are crowded out —the
victims of a foolish system which has tried
to make two into four go three times.
But while we arc still prepared to turn
down common-sensible rationing—the very
latest Federal Arbitration Bill declares that
‘'economic consequences” need not be
taken into account—we have introduced a
system of “rationing” work; and that is a
different matter altogether. The practice,
though it varies in details, has the same
general intention. Too many men are on
one pay-roll, wherefore they are told to
stand aside so many days per month. Now,
this is not a wholly bad plan in cases where
the shortage of work is believed on good
grounds to be merely temporary. But it is
a thoroughly bad plan where there is no
reasonable expectation of an early return
of conditions under which the full staff will
have full employment on remunerative
work. And it is a particularly bad system
to establish or even encourage in Australia
at the present time.
The trouble with Australia is that it has
not produced enough. As The Bulletin
has shown again and again, we have been
living beyond our means to the extent of
40 millions or more a year. Our only hope
of salvation, especially in view of the heavy
fall in the value of our exportable staples,
lies in doing more work. Any system which
condemns men to idleness for so many days
a month will make our recovery more diffi-
cult: if it is carried far, it will make our
recovery hopeless. Apart from the fact
that it keeps men idle who ought because
of our national necessities to be producing
something, it has two chief evil results.
One of our great needs is to reduce our costs
of production. If we are to hold our
markets, this simply must be done. But
even in idleness men and their families
must live; and though nominally a man
may not be paid w r hile he is “stood down,”
he must be paid such a rate while he is at
work that he can save something out of
his earnings to carry him over the idle
period. “Rationing” must always stand,
therefore, in the way of a reduction of costs.
And, in the second place, it is a way of
dodging our obligations to open up new
avenues of employment. This obligation is
not an easy one to accept; but it will have
to be accepted. If men cannot find full-
time work in an industry, it is because of
one of two things: the costs in that indus-
try are too high, or it is overmanned.
“Rationing” is no cure for either of these
conditions. On the contrary, it tends to
maintain high costs and to keep men from
seeking employment elsewhere.
In South Australia a consultative body of
economic and industrial experts has been set
up by the Labor Government, with the full
approval of the Opposition, to explore all
possible avenues of employment. Something
of the same sort might well be done by the
Commonwealth Government. An overhaul
of the list of imports alone might disclose
unrealised possibilities; and if there are
obstacles in the way of the further develop-
ment of the primary industries, upon which
we must still depend for our essential
exports, we ought to know them from an
authoritative source.
Certainly there can be no salvation
through “rationing.” At the best it is a
makeshift, incorporating the worst of those
evils from which we are chiefly suffering,
and only to be put up with while we are
searching out and developing something
better. That search' and that development
is to-day the paramount duty, not only of
every patriotic Australian, but of every
Australian who wants to avoid a catastrophe.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA IN TROUBLE.
When the South Australian Labor Premier
sat down at his well-worn desk one recent
morning he found (1) a memo to the
effect that the year’s shortage was within
an infinitesimal distance of £1,700,000, or £3
per inhabitant including the baby, and
(2) a note to the effect that the Common-
wealth Bank would grant him no more over-
draft here or in London. So the head of
the most heavily taxed and, bar Westralia,
the most heavily indebted of the States
heaved the only article available, which
was a sigh, and pondered.
All S. Australians, including the baby, are
charged £6 10s. Id. per head annually in
State taxation, which is the biggest rate in
Australia, and £1 7s. 6d. above the aver-
age, and a great deal more than double
the impost of ten years ago. To pay £26 os.
4d. per family of four and still to be short
nearly another £l2 probably struck the
Premier as serious. Adding to his tribu-
lations, the markets for the metals which
Broken Hill digs haye crashed disastrously,
so that if more than three of the cos. can
carry on at all it will be only by making
wage-cuts which the miners are at present
quite unwilling to accept. Thus will be
added to the distresses of a railway system
already as distressful as any in Australia—
which is saying a good deal.
Federal Treasurer Theodore issued a
muffled warning to the State Treasurers
that they must make their accounts bal-
ance ; but- with a railway system which has
ceased to pay working expenses, let alone
interest, and with his other troubles, the
man at Adelaide naturally wonders how
he is to do it. He has no cause to wonder
why Theodore asked him to do it. One of
the deeds of the Bruce-Page Ministry was
to set up the Commonwealth as the sole
borrowing authority for the States, and to
make it responsible to the aggregate credi-
tor for interest and sinking fund payments.
It is sure of part of the money in the sense
that it pays about £8.500,000 per annum on
behalf of the States to compensate for the
old subsidy. That is to say, Scullin will
have that amount for certain if he finds it
himself. The other £26.000,000 or so. of
purely State interest he has to'collect from
the State Treasurers, and, the} 7 being an
honest crowd, he is sure of that also—if
they happen to have it. But there are pos-
sibilities in the case of a harried Treas-
urer whose overdraft has been stopped at
the Commonwealth Bank or elsewhere.
(These overdrafts, which seem to be
separate from the debt recognised by the
Loan Council, are a disturbing feature.)
It is hard to imagine what he can do ex-
cept give Canberra the State’s lOU for
unpaid interest, and ask him to put the
Federal endorsement on it and add it to
the debt. Scullin might be boiling mad,
being much in want of real money himself
instead of paper, but he would just have to
boil.
For the rest, the Government, unable to
see daylight ahead, has invited a small com-
mittee to turn its expert eye on the murky
situation. It seems, however, not to be
a situation from which anything in the
way of a “scheme” will release the State.
The simple fact is that a territory
naturally not rich, and almost wholly de-
pendent upon rainfall for its limited wealth,
has had a run of drought years; in some
parts of the Far North there had not been
a decent fall since 1925. Meantime, though
without coal, and thus handicapped so far
as most heavy factory-work is concerned, it
had crowded nearly 60 p.c. of its population
within the metropolitan area. No other city
in Australia and few in the-world includes in
its population so large a proportion of
“retired” people, most of them not aged,
and few of them with very substantial
means. This population has almost all the
virtues except one —it doesn’t do much
work. In a good season the 40 p.c. of the
population in the country makes a veiy
good showing so far as production goes;
in bad times, when so much of the country
production fails, the aggregate production
of the State is startlingly small.
What South Aus. probably needs for the
future, therefore, is that more of its popula-
tion shall get to some real productive
work; and that does not necessarily mean
work on primary products. What it needs
most for the present is hard and bitter
economy; and it can face that with a little
more cheerfulness than it could have done
a fortnight ago—before the threat of
another drought gave way to the promise
of at least an average harvest.
“WE DOCTORS ARE FED UP.”
The present depression has brought to a
head a trouble that has been threatening
the Australian medical world for some time.
No section or class of the community is
suffering more from the crisis in the nation’s
affairs, and the breaking point has been
reached with many of us.
The system at present operating in rela-
tion to the health of our fellows is really
very amusing. With a fine gesture of gener-
osity the community says “We will give
practically free treatment to all the poor
and needy.” As proof of its unbounded
charity the community thereupon instructs
anyone who is afflicted physically to attend
the public hospitals and be healed of his
infirmities free of charge. “You cannot pay?”
asks the community. “Tut, tut! Don’t
let that worry you. We will see you through.”
What is really meant is, “The medical pro-
fession will see you through.” And, believe
me, the medical profession is getting fed
up with it.
The Education Department gives free
schooling to those unable to pay for it.
But the whole community is taxed to
cover the cost of the department, and the
State trains the teacher and pays him a
fair salary in return for his service to the
community. It does not expect the teacher
to train himself and devote a certain
amount of time per week to the free educa-
tion of the community’s children. There
would be a deafening outcry if any such
request was made.
The friendly societies do a little towards
solving the problem of ill-health in Aus-
tralia. For the princely sum of six and
sixpence a quarter they allow a medical
man to look after a man, his wife and any
children he may have under the age of 16.
That might be quite a good idea if each
doctor was able to collect enough lodge
patients to make the thing worth while.
As it is, except in the case of a medical
man with a large lodge practice, it is a
hopeless state of affairs.
The main trouble about medical practice
to-day is that the average man can get all
the treatment he wants free of charge. If
he doesn’t belong to a lodge, he can still
go to a doctor, safe in the knowledge that
he can run up a bill without receiving much
more than a threatening letter if he per-
sistently refuses to pay up. In the event
of such a letter being sent he can go indig-
nantly to one of the gutter-papers that
infest our cities and ask the editor (some-
times with success) to expose this grave
interference with the liberty of the subject.
And woe betide the doctor who refuses to
attend a patient who owes him for pre-
vious visits! I and every other doctor in
this country have a long list of patients
who have never had the slightest intention
of paying us a sou for our attendance and
attention. In my own case bad debts
amount easily to 30 per cent, of my prac-
tice. Another 30 per cent, of my patients
are obviously so poor that one has to send
them a very moderate account in propor-
tion to their actual debt, if any account at all.
There is only one possible solution of
the problem, and that is Compulsory
Health Insurance. Every man whose
income is under a certain sum should be
compelled to either join a lodge or insure
himself against the cost of medical treat-
ment. The scheme has been in vogue for
many years in Great Britain, and, with
certain exceptions, works quite well. The
medical profession has to work haid foi
its money in England, but gets it.
Of. course Compulsory Health Insurance
presents immense problems. The enormous
advance of specialisation is the most con-
founding problem of all, but it can be
solved. And I suggest that it simply has
to be solved, and that in the very near
future. At the Sydney Medical School
there are (I am told) fewer undergraduates
than there have been for many years.
Public hospitals are finding it extra-
ordinarily difficult to obtain resident
doctors. Their munificent salary of 19
shillings per week is sadly lacking in
attraction. Can you wonder at the threat-
ened shortage?
The ordinary medical man has to stay
at school till he is 18, after which he does
a six years’ course at the medical school.
He then has a couple of years’ hospital
experience, and at the age of 26 he begins
to try to earn an honest penny. By the
time he is 30 he may or may not be earn-
ing as much as the. average bricklayer.
From then onward his life is that of a
professional philanthropist. No doubt it is
all very beautiful and heroic. Certainly as
long as the doctor doesn’t object the com-
munity has every reason to be well pleased
with the arrangement. But the handwrit-
ing is on the w 7 all. For the past six years
medical men have been becoming fewer
and less. The day has gone by when any
but a rich man can keep a son in idleness
till he reaches 30.
Some of us can foresee the day when
health will be a national concern and when
the ordinary individual will have as much
hope of escaping paying his health insur-
ance as his income tax. The important
point is that such an arrangement would
probably be a much cheaper business for
the individual—certainly for the honest
individual—than the present system—or
lack of system.
CLAUDE OESOFHAGOS.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
False Hopes.
A statement from London is to the effect
that the Bank of England will guarantee
interest and sinking fund on Australia’s
external debt for three years, provided the
Commonwealth swears off all foreign bor-
rowing for that period. This statement is
mischievous because it will lead many
Australians to expect terms which it would
be impossible for any sane bank to offer.
It is understandable that Britain should
take some risks to avert an Australian
bankruptcy in which it would be the chief
creditor, but it is hard to suppose that it
would do so without assurance that the
smash would be really averted and not
merely postponed. The present Ministry
may be ready and anxious to suppress the
importing mania, which fills the Common-
wealth with unemployment and makes it
hopelessly unable to pay its bills except with
the aid of big loans. But its work might
be undone by the advent of a Red revolu-
tionary Government, or, what would amount
to much the same thing, a Freetrade and
importing one.
Any sufficient help is therefore almost
certain to have attached to it some terms
which, however politely they are camou-
flaged, will be damaging to Australia’s
independence. It may be a trifle
humiliating if the Commonwealth is put
under mild restraint and has to go around
with a keeper, but that would be better than
having its Constitution suspended. The
Devil is sick and given to good resolutions,
and if he makes a temporary recovery with
the aid of medicine furnished on credit, it
is important that he should stick to them.
It will still be possible to lead a moderately
expensive life by the aid of local paper
loans, which are always procurable, for
Parliament may order anybody or every-
body to subscribe after the Russian fashion.
At the worst that might lead to a compro-
mise with internal creditors, but that is very
different from failure to settle with external
ones.

Neither Good Democrats nor Good
Sports.
Parliament in N. S. Wales passed a law
prescribing a 48-hour week. At Broken Hill
and elsewhere certain unions have refused
to obey this law, and the refusal is called
a strike. It is nothing of the sort. A section
of the community does not “strike”
against a law of which it disapproves. When
there is concerted refusal it is a rebellion.
These Broken Hill and other people who
combine to defy a law duly enacted are.
plain rebels and nothing else.
That what they are doing is only a
shade more impudent than much that
has been done lately does not at all
excuse them. The fact is that a most
dangerous tendency has developed in the
last few years—a tendency to regard any
law passed by a Government of which we
do not approve as something that ought to
be either resisted or scorned. The tendency
is especially marked in N. S. Wales, where
“Oh, that’s only one of Bavin’s laws!” is
taken to justify any degree of Labor non-
observance. There are men in the Labor
party who know how wrong and dangerous
such an attitude is, yet arc too much afraid
of hurting their political skins to say so.


EXPLORING.
“The Federal Cabinet has been exploring all possible avenues by which additional revenue might be obtained.”
THEODORE: “I think we’ve taken all he’s got, Chief.”
THE CHIEF: "Better pull off his boots, though. He may be hiding a few coppers in them.”
And, besides, it is not “sporting,” and for
that reason should have no tolerance
among Australians. When the umpire has
given his decision the play goes on as if
the dispute, whatever it was, had never
arisen. It does not matter whether we think
the umpire was right or wrong. If he was
flagrantly wrong there is generally some
redress afterwards. Meantime, the decision
must be accepted. The man who makes
a practice of accepting a decision when it
goes his way and disputing or disregard-
ing it when it goes to the opponent could
have no place in any sporting game in
Australia.
Doubtless these Broken Hill men and
others acting similarly regard themselves
as “stalwarts” and all the rest of it. They
may even believe they are the vanguard of
democracy. Let them disabuse their minds
of any such idea. They are the Judases
of democracy. And, stalwart or otherwise,
they are doing a thing which in the realm
of sport would get them hustled off the
field for not knowing how to play the game.
L*
Theodore, McCormack and Mungana.
For a long time past ugly stories have been
in circulation in Queensland concerning the
Labor Government’s purchase of certain
Mungana mining leases (previously for-
feited to the Crown for non-payment of
rent) for £40,000 and the running of the
enterprise, together with other properties
in the Chillagoe district, by the State.
The names of William McCormack and
E. G. Theodore, both State Premiers and
the latter now Treasurer of the Common-
wealth, were invidiously mentioned, and
a conviction that there was ground for the
allegations had a lot to do with the smash-
ing defeat of the State Labor party last
year. During McCormack’s Premiership an
inquiry was asked for again and again by
members of the Opposition, the reply
always being that, although McCormack
was interested in the show, there was noth-
ing to inquire about.
The investigation following the change of
Government was delayed to admit of Mc-
Cormack going abroad to consult a doctor.
On his return Premier Moore handed a
Commission to ex-Justice Campbell, of
N. S. Wales. That gentleman has spent
two months examining witnesses and docu-
ments and listening to counsel’s addresses.
He finds that there was “reckless extrava-
gance, unscrupulous exploitation, suppres-
sion and misrepresentation of* truth in yearly
balance-sheets and cynical transgression of
the law,” leading to a loss to the people of
£1 127,000 exclusive of interest. He reports
also that “Theodore, McCormack, God-
dard (general manager at Chillagoe) and
Reid (from whom the Mungana leases were
bought) were guilty of fraud and dis-
honesty in procuring the State to purchase
Mungana Mines for £40,000”; that Theo-
dore’s banking account showed that he re-
ceived regularly one-half of McCormack s
share of the fruits”; that “Theodore was
guilty of the grossest impropriety in becom-
ing secretly associated with Goddard in
the Fluorspar Mining Co. and the Argen-
tum Mining Co.”; that Jones, the Labor
Minister of Mines, was cognisant of God-
dard’s transgressions, but showed no par-
ticular concern; and that “misrepresenta-
tion of the economic position and results
of the enterprise could have been sustained
only by the tacit connivance, or at least
accommodating silence, of the Auditor-
General” of the period.
Goddard, Jones, Reid, Dunlop ; (the
Warden who recommended the granting of
the leases to Reid) and officials of the
Auditor-General’s Department were among
the many witnesses examined. McCormack
was summoned to give evidence but for-
warded a medical certificate instead. Theo-
dore sent word that he could not spare the
time. In face of these notorious facts,
Graves, president of the N. S. Wales Labor
executive, has the effrontery to declare
that Mr. Campbell’s staggering report was
“based on ex-parte statements.” It cannot
be disposed of in that way, and no sincere
well-wisher of the party can desire that it
should be. If there are rogues in the party,
only its enemies will desire that they re-
main there.
Running True to Form.
One night last week word came from
Sydney police division No. 12, which covers
half a dozen thickly-populated suburbs and
as many outer districts, that not one police
offence had been reported for 36 hours.
Thereupon Chief Detective Mackay said
that “the present crime position, as seen
through a policeman’s eyes, is a wonderful
compliment to the honesty of the average
Australian”; and he added: “I know of
no other country which could provide so
creditable a record in such times.”
A just tribute, made all the more telling
by the fact that Chief Detective Mackay
is not Australian-born and was one of the
leaders of the police who put down mass-
picketing on the Newcastle-Maitland coal-
fields, where he saw a large section of
unionists in their most turbulent mood. In
the greatest industrial 1 disaster which has
come upon this generation, the Australian
worker is preserving his essential decency
and self-respect. Jobless, ill-clad, hungry,
he is running true to form.
And the record of the times is sprinkled
with glowing, if all too brief, histories of
brave deeds done by obscure workingmen
at the simple call of duty. During the
Hunter River floods scores of railwaymen
risked their lives, and worked up to their
waists in water for days together, to get
the trains moving again. “Flames enveloped
the cab of an engine drawing a passenger
train from Newcastle to Cessnock. Driver
Russell, though almost mad with pain,
saved his train and was carried unconscious
from the burning engine, his clothes just
smouldering rags; Fireman Abrahams,
though badly burned, clung to the hand-
brake until the train was brought to a
standstill.” “Three laborers were buried
when a tunnel collapsed at Lilydale (Vic.);
from 4.30 p.m. till midnight their mates
worked in foul air and dangerous ground
trying to save them.”
Wage-payers have their own troubles
these days, and many of them feel bitterly
that Australia has been brought to its
present pass by work-stoppers and vote-
buying politicians. But it is not _ a time
for railing or wailing. It is a time for
helping honest men and women who are
down —in most cases, through no fault of
their own. Help of the sort that enables
them to keep their heads up will not be
wasted. The country will emerge from its
trial happier and more contented if those
who have any employment to give at this
juncture give it in a generous spirit.
Prices Are Falling.
The Commonwealth Statistician announced
last week that both wholesale and retail
prices were very definitely lower. It is
about time we made this discovery.
Hitherto we have fixed most of our
wages according to the price of commo-
dities in Australia—that is, according to the
alleged cost of living here. Over many
years The Bulletin has condemned this
practice. But if we must be unscientific and
fix basic wages and other such absurdities
according to the price of commodities, let
us at least be a little less unscientific and
mad than we have been, and let those wages
move up and down, not as prices move in
Australia, but as they move in London.
For a year past there has been very little
movement in what are known as the index
numbers in Australia, and consequently
there has been hardly a movement in wages.
A slight reduction certainly was made in
the basic wage here and there; but actually
substantial increases have. been demanded
in many cases. Yet the prices of Australian
staples in the markets of the world have
fallen almost incredibly. Wool opened in
London this year almost exactly one-third
below the opening rates for 1929, and that
in its turn was more than a third lower
than the opening of 1925. Wheat for for-
ward delivery was sold last week in America
at a price equal to 3s. 3d. on sidings in
Australia. Lead, £23 13s. 9d. at the middle
of last year, is £l7 15s. now; and spelter
(zinc) has fallen in the same period from
£26 Is. 3d. to £l6 Bs. 9d. These are the prices
that matter in Australia; these are the
specifications to which we have to work;
these are the figures which decide what we
can pay. If, therefore, Mr. Piddington
must have his basic wage, let him argue
with the gentlemen who buy our wool and
our metals: they and they alone are the
people who, by paying a few pounds more
for metals and a few pence more for wool,
can make it possible for us to pay a higher
basic wage, or possibly maintain the one
we’ve got.
For it all boils down in the last resort
to the fact that, being a debtor nation, we
are committed to pay large sums m interest
and for redemptions, and to make those
payments we must produce at a price which
will allow sales to be made abroad. So our
costs of production must be governed, not
by the cost of living (that is, the price of
commodities) at Darling Point or Foots-
cray or anywhere else in Australia, but by
the price of commodities in the foreign
markets to which we have to send our
products.

Broken Hill and a Way Out.
For many years past Broken Hill has been
living on oats; so that now when it is told
that oats are off and a reduction of 17J per-
cent. in wages must be made, it tells the cos.
not to be “childish.” Yet there is no doubt
in the wide world that even with a 17t
per cent, reduction the cos. concerned will
merely consume ore without making a
profit. And there is no doubt in the wide
world that the union leaders know it, too.
What, then, is behind the decision of
these men? What is at the back of theif
heads? , - ,
There are nowadays only half a dozen
cos. working on the Broken Hill line of
lode. There it has been a case of l “the
last shall be first and the first last.” Those
centrally situated mines which got on to the
riches first lost them soonest; those at the
extremities of the saddle were late in
getting on to them and hold them longest.
The cos., therefore, never have been, and
are not now, all in the same financial posi-
tion. At the present time three of them can
carry on while maintaining recent wage
rates; the other three cannot. What is
troubling the unions seems to be the fear
that two rates of pay cannot be maintained
in the one industry and that an accepted
reduction of pay in the poorer mines will be
followed by a demand for reduction in the
richer.
But a way can surely be found out of that
very real difficulty. For a year and a
quarter the Broken Hill men paid 12jr per
cent, of their earnings to maintain the out-
of-work coalminers. The question is now
whether the men at the richer mines are
prepared to pay into a fund 10 or per
cent., or whatever other lesser amount may
be necessary, in order to supplement the
reduced pay which the poorer cos. can
afford. A very simple fortnightly calculation
would show how much must be deducted
from the pay of the one lot and used
as a bonus for the other lot to make the
pay over the whole field uniform. -
Under some such scheme the richer will
be made to keep the poorer running, to
the great gain not only of the men who
would otherwise be thrown out of work but
of Australia. For lead, zinc and silver are
all very saleable commodities, albeit at
tremendously reduced prices; wherefore one
man employed producing these metals m
the present crisis is worth 100 men
employed making a new suburban road.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Commissioner Campbell’s smashing report
on the Mungana-Cliillago'e business led to
Theodore resigning his portfolio but not his
seat. The man from Dailey protests that
he was condemned unheard. The answer
to that is that he undertook to give evidence
and did not attend, though informed that
for his convenience the inquiry would be
kept open for another week. True, he was
at work on hi s Budget; but he had known
for at least two months that his honor was
at stake, and if lie couid come to Sydney for
week-ends during that period he could surely
have gone to Brisbane—a mail ’plane would
have taken him there in five hours and a
half.
While the Mungana report was trickling
through to Canberra the Senate threw out
the Wheat Marketing Bill. That same day
wheat was offered in Sydney at 4s. L|d. a
bushel and sold in Chicago at 90 cents "(the
Scullidores wanted to guarantee 4s. Bd. at
ports conditionally on the farmers accept-
ing a compulsory pool), and a member of
the Canadian board of railway commissioners
said that the Dominion’s economic structure
had been shaken to its foundations through
the failure of its wheat pool. The Senate
has done well.
The Hughes party has entered a candi-
date for the by-election at Lane Cove
(N.S.W.) to make it a triangular contest.
The party has no State programme, and if
the man who follows Hughes were to get
in Hughes wouldn’t be there to lead him.
Still, his interposition may help Labor a
little, and Labor may help Hughes in North
Sydney when Hughes has to face the music
again.
To judge by advance reports, the en-
larged Federal income tax covers every-
thing, including 2| per cent, on treasure
laid up in Heaven. Yet there is an omis-
sion, after all. Nothing is specifically levied
on the proceeds of burglaries, robbery with
violence, forgery, embezzlement, life-insur-
ance and mining swindles and the like. And
it isn’t on record that any practitioner in
these arts has been tried for diddling the
Treasury out of its share of the loot.
A plea for a truce in Vic. party polities
has been made by Hogan. A truce surely
implies that two sides should consent to
sacrifices, but Hogan wants Parliament to
pool its thought for the general good (as, of
GENERAL HOGAN : “I t’s like this — I lead one
army and there are three armies against
me. We have a truce and I command
the lot.”
course, it should), and remain content with
an executive committee chosen by 30 mem-
bers of the Assembly and six of the Council
in Labor Caucus. No truce, can be honest
and fruitful without an elective Ministry.
The tax on the earnings of foreigners who
fill Australia with imported films and carry
away the takings in large bags is a poor
old thing, after all. Not more than 30 per
cent, is to be regarded as profit, and the
tax is to be the ordinary company rate on
the 30 p.c. or less, nothing being added for
past immunity, evasion or swindling. So
nothing has happened to dissipate the sus-
picion that the film “industry” financed the
Labor party lavishly at the Federal elec-
tion, and has been drawing its wages ever
since.
The A.W.U. and the Miners’ Federation
are talking amalgamation again. The pro-
spects are not very exhiliarating. The heads
last discussed it 10 years ago, since when
Willis, of the Miners, and Bailey, of the
A.W.U., have been fighting all over the place,
and barrels of ink have been shot at one
another by the “Worker” and the “Labor
Daily.” Only the other day the miners and
other organisations were ordered to pay
the damages owing by Willis to the A.W.TJ.
feudist. And then amalgamation would
throw a lot of union officials out of work.
Although there has been a
decided slump in the Federal
concern, and others, business
is still brisk in “Good Ole
Piddo’s” wage-fixing shop.
For one thing, the N.S.W.
School-teachers’ Federation,
which was awarded thump-
ing increases last year, is
going on with its claim that
the increases .should date
from July 1, 1927. It is
asserted that an arrange-
ment to this effect was
made by the representatives
of both parties on the con-
ciliation board —in short, by
some civil servants with
others, the public to pay—
but this Minister Drummond
denies. In 1928 the N.S.W.
education bill climbed to
£5,251,700, of which “teach-
ers’ salaries,” the record
says, “amounted to
£3,225,400, an increase of
£180,300 over 1927.” A
worse time for demanding
three years’ back pay could
not be imagined.
In one respect McPhee
was the least unsuccessful
of all the Treasurers last
year. He estimated the Tas.
revenue at £2,691,278, and receipts were
just £79 more.
“Another £300,000 gone west,” was the
groan of Parkhill, M.H.R., when the Govern-
ment pushed through a £300,000 guarantee
to enable a Westralian mining co. to ex-
periment with a gold-extraction process. It
is said that the process may reduce the cost
of extraction by one-half, which should be
good enough, if true, to attract private capi-
tal. The State, it seems, has already guaran-
teed the £300,000, and the Commonwealth is
relieving it of the liability. It is alleged that
no risk whatsoever is attached, in which
case the State might almost as well remain
in and let the Commonwealth remain out.
The Scullin Government pushed its Arbi-
tration Bill practically through , the House
and then came to a sudden halt as if it had
seen a ghost. The measure was moved from
the top of the business paper to down near
the bottom, and the Attorney-General had
the job of explaining why. When he had
finished no one was any wiser. A man is
now on his way from London to talk
about the Bank of England guaranteeing
Australia’s solvency abroad for a term of
years. Possibly it is desired not to show
undue haste in making a bad impression
either on the emissary or on the outside
capitalists who, it is hoped, will put their
money into new factories here.
When Vic. Assembly resumes on July 23
Plogan will submit the supplementary esti-
mates and tell the House that there was a
deficit of close on £BOO,OOO for 1929-30,
attributable mainly to the falling-off in rail-
way revenue. The Ministry hopes to get
through without reducing civil servants’
salaries, but those due for increments are
apprehensive.
Tas. Parliament meets on July 16 for the
final session of its three years’ term. _ The
McPliees expect the session to be lively,
though the threatened demand for an inquiry
into the allegedly excessive stinging of fruit-
growers by a stevedoring co. has been anti-
cipated by the appointment of a royal com-
mission ; for the rest, Labor’s attacks, they
say, are no longer directed with the skill
and precision of Lyons’s operations. They
point gleefully to the fact that when the
present P.-M.G. was at the head of Tas.
Labor there were no other aspirants for the
leadership. Ogilvie has several rivals about
his throne.
The girl who gets 355. a week in a Sydney
tea-and-scone shop and tries to keep herself
respectable by “rooming” in a 12 x 10 bed-
sitting-room with the community gas-ring in
one corner has to pay her little unemploy-
ment ta?x; but if the Government collects a
bean from the bookmaker who spends 355. a
week on cigars it will be very lucky. Yet
there is no turnover in the State which could
be more easily levied on than the book-
maker’s ; if the employer can be compelled to
put a 3d. tax on the wage-sheet for every £
of wages he pays, the bookie can surely be
driven to put a 3d. stamp on his book for
every £ of betting money he drops in his bag.
But there are precious few Governments in
Australia that would have the pluck to ask
him to do it.
The most futile strike on record was that
of the amalgamated engineers employed at
Yallourn (Vic.), where electrical power is
extracted from brown coal and distributed
throughout the State. The strikers believed
that by staying off duty they would plunge
Melbourne in darkness and bring a lot of
industries to a stop. Monash and his
staff prepared for such a threat by in-
stalling machinery which very nearly elimi-
nates the human element; moreover, subsi-
“Fll have three years’ back pay.”
diary supplies of juice are available at the
Sugarloaf works, which are driven by moun-
tain torrents that never go on strike. Yal-
lourn, with its model township, theatre, etc.,
is a great socialistic enterprise, but that
didn’t trouble the socialists who struck.
Westralian secessionists claim that there
are now three States in the movement, Tas-
mania and South Aus. being the other two.
The position may be put this way. In the
years 1921-29 the Federal Government in-
creased the Federal debt by about £20,000,000
(from £357,136,684 to £377,621,572), while
the State Governments increased the State
debts by about £256,000,000 (from
£470,879,162 to £726,406,400). Now certain
State politicians allege that they have been
ruined by Federal extravagance, and that
they would have done much better if they
had kept single. Many a man says the
same thing after he has spent all his wife’s
money. Secession is a craze, like the loan
craze which led up to it.
It is about a year and a half since Rip
Van Ward returned to the Maoriland Prime
Ministership, and his wonderful plan for
borrowing £70,000,000 of J. Bull’s money,
spread over seven years or so, showed that
he hadn’t changed. After floating a robust
instalment of his loan Ward fell ill. His
successor, Forbes, reports a £3,000,000 deficit,
and foreshadows retrenchment and extra
taxes. It has become a common remark over
on the other side that the Dominion lias
unfortunately been following in Australia’s
footsteps. But in the first joyful burst of
Josephism it thought it was inventing some-
thing quite new.
Victoria is talking about reducing the
number of its public holidays, now 14 and
sometimes 15 a year. Civil servants pro-
test that this allowance is not excessive, and
point out that the departments used to close
on Separation Day (July 1), Whit Monday,
Guy Fawkes’s Day and Prince of Wales’s
birthday. Still, there wasn’t so much sick
leave, or annual leave, or “long” leave, or
so many conferences in other States then.
The secesh agitation in Westralia finds
little support in Labor ranks ; Collier has
definitely condemned it. There is consistency
in the attitude, for no section did more than
the unions—the Parliamentary Labor party
had not then arrived—to ensure a Yes vote
for Federation when Forrest was forced to
submit the question to the people. The A.N.A.
pulled some weight, but nothing in compari-
son with Labor. A few months later there
were four Labor men out of eleven in the
State’s first contribution to the Federal Par-
liament, and it was mostly their referendum
activities that put them there. _ •
The Nat. Government of China is per-
turbed because a rival war-lord has put
Putnam Weale, the novelist, in charge of
the foreign Customs at Tientsin. The Nan-
king crowd pays most of the interest on
its foreign loans out of Customs revenue,
and it would soon collapse if the Tientsin
precedent were followed in Canton and
Shanghai. As neither side recognises the
other’s officials, .some foreign traders sug-
gest running their goods in free, in which
case Britain, France and America will pro-
bably do what they did when the Customs
broke down in 1853—collect the duties them-
selves and hold the cash in trust for the
distracted owners. It was out of that action
that the Chinese Imperial Customs arose,
and under Robert Hart became the most suc-
cessful public department China has had
for hundreds of years.
Crofts, the Australian delegate to the
International Labor Conference in Geneva,
is reported to have told that body that his
A.G.T.U. linked up with the Fan-Pacific
Secretariat because it believed a great Pacific
war was imminent, and that the secretariat
was the one hope of averting the catastrophe.
This is rich, considering that the Red ruf-
fians behind the secretarial were concerned in
the revolt of the native army in French
Cochin-China, the late rebellion in Java, the
horrible Burmese affair in which Buddhists
burnt Hindus and sundry disturbances
in the Philippines. These outbreaks were
only prevented from becoming more than
mere local shindies by the “Western imperial-
ism” at which the Crofts and their Mus-
covite masters rave.
The further hacking down of the British
naval estimates has led Beatty to tell the
House of Lords that Britain is dropping-
lower and lower in the way of sea power, as
a matter of economy, till it looks like becom-
ing no Power at all. The position is cer-
tainly difficult. Ramsay MacDonald’s Minis-
try is pledged to sacrifice revenue by abolish-
ing Protectionist (or “safeguarding”) duties.
In doing this it destroys employment. Twenty
special trains were recently engaged to carry
5000 Nottingham laceworkers to London to
plead that they had lost their jobs because
their trade ~liad been one of the 'early sacri-
fices to the Moloch of Cobdenism. They and
their families add to the cost of supporting
the unemployed, so there is less revenue
along with more expenditure. One expedient
is to cut down national defence to the danger
point or below it, and to add some of the
national defenders to the unemployed, which
again helps to swell the outgoings. ■ Aus-
tralian Labor is doing this as well as British
Labor, wiuely as they differ on the tariff
issue; so Beatty may well be alarmed.
British Labor is not so enthusiastic as
some of its Australian comrades about “Pan-
Pacific secretariats” and the like. A show
called the International Trades-union Com-
mittee of Negro Workers applied to the
Home Office for permission to hold a con-

ference in London, the indications being
that an indaba in America would be un-
healthy. .The request was sponsored by
Marley, one of the left-wing M’s.l*., but was
turned down. There are now doubts as to
whether the Rammaes are really sound on
the question of the brudderhood of man.
The removal of the balance of the
Federal public service from Melbourne to
Canberra has been postponed sine die. The
men left in Melbourne are pleased because
everybody hates the Federal village, and
those already at ’Berra are aggrieved because
they want customers and company. The mer-
cantile folk have an especial hump, for they
bought business sites in what they reckoned
was a whole capital, and not a half one. It
would cost £2,000,000 to shift the rest of
the Service (such of it as can be removed),
and it is calculated that the result would
be an increase of population from 7000
to 11,000 souls. Nobody expects any comers
except civil servants, and even 11,000
quiet, respectable bodies of that sort
wouldn’t make a busy, whizzy metropolis,
with sins and scandals and night clubs and
conspiracies and mysteries and divorces and
disappearances. It is hardly possible for
even a gay old spark to lead the double wife
in such surroundings. Some day ’Berra may
wake up and find that it isn’t there, having
moved in the night.

“Pursuivant”: The knighthood of the order
of St. John of Jerusalem, bestowed on N.S.W.
Governor Game, is not as big a thing as_ it
sounds. The order of medical monks, which
began at Jerusalem in the days of the
Crusades, grew to a military organisation
so threatening to the State that, like the

Templars, it was hoofed out of most of the
kingdoms of Europe. Britain applied the
boot in 1540, and after a short armistice
swung it again 20 years later. The knights
set up house in Malta, where they were a
power for centuries, but since Napoleon
captured their island on his way to Egypt
their order has faded to practical extinction.
The British body from which Governor
Game takes his knighthood dates back to
1888 only; Queen Victoria granted it a
charter in that year. It is practically an
adjunct to the Red Cross movement, and
its titles have no standing among the world s
official distinctions of the kind.

“Pawang” : Bacteriological preventive work
has suffered some setbacks of late. The
medical world had not recovered from the
shock of learning that 17 children had died
as a result of being
inoculated with anti-
diphtheric serum at
Bundaberg (Q.) when
it was shaken anew
,by the deaths of 19
infants in Lubeck,
Germany, after treat-
ment by the Calmette
prophylactic _ system
for tuberculosis. This
consists in the intro-
duction into the blood
of germs from tuber-
cular cows. Accord-
ing to the Pasteur
Institute, which has
inquired into the
ghastly affair at
Lubeck, virulent tuber-
culosis vaccine must,
have been substituted
in the laboratory for
the Calmette vaccine,
an explanation which
accords with the find-
ings in the Bunda-
berg case that the
bacteria had become
enormously more
potent than they
should be through
being kept too long.
One of the troubles
with all sorts of vac-
cination is that the
medical practitioner
who uses serum may
have had a very
sketchy training in
the technique of hand-
ling this medicinal
dynamite. The in-
structions on the
bottle and a paragraph in the manufacturer s
pamphlet are often about the limit ot ms
information on the subjectand new serums
are being invented almost every day.

“Hamer”: Vauxhall House, Sydney, scene
of the fire in which the caretaker’s wife and

first venture in city property and publishing.
The “Worker” blossomed there into a journal
which became useful to freelance writers;
Lawson, W. B. Melville and Rod Quinn

tants were Tom Mutch, M.L.A., Carl Akhurst
(now one of the trustees of the Primary Pro-
ducers’ Bank) and Jack Higgins, M.L.C.
On one historic occasion there was a strike
of poets. The “Worker” was sprinkling its
pages with topical verse, and the bards
downed pens for a basic rate of sixpence
a line. Their pickets had their h.q. in the
pub next door, but there was always a poet
on the “Worker” doorstep to warn off free
verse-laborers. The management caved in.

his eyes met mine, and I sauntered away,
Dungaree following. Saunter and pursuit
developed into a Sheffield sprint, and I
reached the nearest street corner leading
by three yards, with my opponent gain-
ing and the delighted populace some distance
behind. I swung round the corner and fell.
The wild man, tripping over me, came down
heavily on his head. When the multitude
reached us, I was standing over my adver-
sary in a threatening attitude, but he was
insensible. “Kidded ’im round the corner an’

ration for three years having been proved,

“P.1.E.U.”: Reading in the Brisbane
papers that there was to be an issue of
greatcoats to the unemployed, I tried to
get one. I was first introduced to the State
Stores, then to the Bureau of Industry, then
to Victoria Barracks, and then to the R. S.
League. The League gave me a typed docu-
ment certifying that I was a returned
soldier out of a job and out of clothes, and
I took it to the Town Clerk, who added a
few lines in red ink and directed mq to the
Fathers’ Association. Fathers’ Association,
being out of greatcoats, sent me to the Labor
Bureau. Finally I was given an order on
State Stores, the original place of call. And
while this comedy was going on impostors
were getting two and three orders for coats
and boots and selling the goods for beer.

“Johnny II.” : Major Billy Young, of the 9th
Battalion,' having been severely wounded in
the foot, was placed in command of a base
camp in England. He had a habit of rising
very early and going round the huts. If
he spotted a youngster recently arrived from
Australia he would gently shake the sleeper
and say in a soft voice "Come on, my son;
it’s time to get up.” Often the reply would
he, “All right, Mum!” But one summer
morning the Major saw a Digger asleep be-
tween two huts after a night out, and varied
the procedure. “Cripes, Dig,” he said, “we
had a bonzer time last night, didn’t we?”
The reveller looked at him doubtfully, but
Billy assured him that they had been out
together, and even named the inn and the
brand of alcohol. “You must be the bloke,
said the full private at last. “So you can

Billy grinned and paid up like a sport. ,

“Chevroford” : The other evening a blan-
ket of fog as thick as anything I ever saw
in London descended on Melbourne. It
threw most of the theatres out of gear owing
to the late arrival of trams and trains. A
young man stepped out of a carriage whioi
had halted on a railway bridge and was
killed; two persons were knocked over by
cars, and a lorry mounted a footpath and
entered a shop, the driver being badly hurt.
The verdict in this case was that he had
collapsed owing to the strain of driving in
the murk, and I can well believe it. Driving
at six or seven miles an hour on a route i
have covered hundreds of times, I lost myself
time and again. The landmarks I had
noticed under ordinary conditions all seemed
to have vanished, and a strange lot appeared
—a well-known phenomenon of fogs. To be
lost in a Melbourne suburb with a visibility
of less than six feet is an eerie experience.
The footpaths being invisible, the only
reliable guide is the cable-tram track, but
following it does not add to one’s sense
of .security, as the rumble of the endless rope
is exactly like the sound of a tram coming
up from behind. Moreover, pedestrians
imagine that the motorist can see them as
well as they can see a well-lighted car, and
act accordingly. Actually, . the brighter the
headlights the less the visibility. It is better
to crawl along with dimmed, lamps or even
with only parking lights switched on.

“Wart”: An old building in Brisbane-
street, Launceston (Tas.), has been bought
by the Baptists, who intend to erect a church
on the site. It was a dosshouse in recent
years, but had more prosperous days. It was
originally a club house for the officers of the
99th Regiment. Then it became the. Club
Hotel, and it was a goldmine in the ’sixties
when Mrs. Lukin, landlady of the Cornwall
Hotel, took it over and persuaded Pages the
coaching people, to make it their northern
headquarters. The Duke of Edinburgh
stayed at the club while he was in Launces-
ton, and Sir Richard Dry had a suite of
rooms there. Then it fell on evil days.

“Innisfree”: Dr. Hugh Black, who has
been in Melbourne for a few months preach-
ing the Turnbull sermons and looked in at
Sydney on the way back home to New Tork,
used to be assistant minister to Dr. White,
the pastor of the St. George’s I ree Church
flock at Edinburgh. Dr. White was one oi
the old school which regarded all men as
miserable sinners and promised them plenty
of brimstone in the hereafter. Dr. Black,
on the other hand, belonged to the more
tolerant modern school, which holds that tew
men are as bad as they are painted 80
it used to be said that Dr. White blackened
saints in the morning and Dr. Black
whitened sinners in the evening.

“C Q” • In a Melbourne basement the
health authorities lately discovered nearly
two million feet of film, stored in tin con-
tainers in open wooden bins. A similar
quantity was lying in disorder in an adjoin-

inflammable material; in another room girls
were engaged in winding, unwinding arm
repairing film. The total weight ol celluloid
on the premises was estimated at seven tons.
Up above is a picture-theatre accommodating
2000 people. Recently a mechanical device
was installed which emitted constant raucous
laughter as an invitation for the populace to

something horribly unpleasant, the City

girl demonstrated what woman could do in

pupil to make a solo flight round Australia.
It was then reported that women m all
parts were trying to raise the money to

expenses of any promising pupil .who was
financially embarrassed. Inquiries came
from every State in the Commonwealth, and

A DARLINGHURST IDYLL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In William-street, about the traffic peak,
There came a spectacle I count unique;
It may not be these sybaritic days—-
I only know the sooth of that I speak.
I wandered lonely as a cloud to buy
A mug of beer (with bitter) and to try
To hit upon the iridescent phrase
And pour libation to the gods on high.
1 little wot that I were yet to peep
At Strephon (though I did not note Ins
sheep) ;
Rather, the Virgil of our present age,
My thoughts were tuned to strains Pro-
foundly deep.
Suddenly, Phyllis to my vision sprang.
Tripping unheedful of the tram-bell’s clang ;
I, like Ulysses, cast the Fates a gage,
And followed, though ’twere to W allera-
wang.
Rounded as apples of Hesperides,
(Her skirt perhaps a shade above her
knees) ,
She frolicked on amidst the raucous host,
Free as a petal on the vernal breeze.
But at the last I furled my galley’s sails,
And turned to buy me bitter beer by pails.
For there she met against a safety-post
A comely block-boy polishing his nails.
What recked he that the weapon of his
trade .. . ,
Stood poised before him while a John
surveyed
His apathy what time the traffic flowed i
She beckoned —and, instanter, he obeyed.
Venus forfend that I should chance to rob
Dear pulchritude of one enraptured sob:
But still I wondered (in Victoria-road)
What made him take a nail-file on his job?

“Barangkali”: Two Chinamen were found
dead in their bunks after the Marella had
been fumigated by the health authorities in
Melbourne. The evidence indicated that they
had taken opium, and, lulled into sweet

of the deadly cyanogen gas. The incident
reads like a parable on the Australian poli-
tician and the loan policy.

“R.P.T.”: Consternation mingled with
amusement when a bright young man
from overseas lectured to a highbrow audi-
ence in the City of Churches. “In London,’

say, centres in three highly educated women
who suddenly find themselves transplanted
from the inner circle of Moscow to a large
provincial town like —er —Adelaide. A town
far from the heart of the Empire, where there
is little or no culture, and where they
slowly undergo intellectual starvation,” It
was a more tactful young man from overseas

“Sol M.”: Iceland is having a 1000th
birthday this year, its Parliament, the daddy
of all surviving legislatures, being ten cen-
turies old. A British warship and some aero-
planes are paying a call to attend the festivi-
ties, and other nations will be represented.
Iceland was settled by Norwegians, Scots
and Irishmen in search of freedom, and no
one ever took it from them. The area is
nearly half that of Victoria, but about 85
per cent, of it is no good for man or beast,
and the population is something approaching
that of Newcastle (N.S.W.). Still the island
has a university, five high schools, two agri-
cultural schools, a school of navigation, a
few continuation schools, and all the other
educational advantages which a population

of 100,000 can expect. It has an extensive
literature, much larger than that of New-
castle (N.S.W.), universal suffrage for men
and women “of good character” aged 25 and
over, old age pensions, a regular surplus
(it raised a defence loan in case the Kaiser
should come along, in which event it was
intended to make him wish he had never
been born, and is paying it off), an
elaborate local-government system (there are
over 200 mayors and corporations), a State
bank, a private bank and 50 savings banks.
The Cabinet consists of three Ministers, Mr.
Tryggvi Thorhallsson, who plays a double
part, and Mr. Jonas Jonsson. In short, it is
a quiet place with an atmosphere of respecta-
bility. According to Jules Verne, it is con-
nected by a subterranean passage with Italy,
but this is disputed.

“Shep”: The view from the second floor
of our Razorhurst place was an expanse of
galvanised-iron factory-roofing, starting off
about an arm’s length from the bedroom win-
dows. The roof’s advantages
didn’t dawn on us till one of
the tenants, prompted by a
series of anonymous ’phone
calls, took a night shift off to
test the loyalty of his spouse.
At the usual hour he bade the
lady adieu at the front en-
trance door of the flats; then
he stole round to the back
door, and, taking up a posi-
tion there, saw his substitute
being over-fondly welcomed.
He followed the pair upstairs.
The door was bolted inside, so
he had to give away the show
by ringing the door bell.
Blaming a fit of giddiness for
his return, he searched
through the tiny apartments
without finding even a hat.
But rainspots on the bed-
room window-sill showed him
that exit had recently been
used, and, satisfied that the
escapee could not get back off
the roof, he settled down in
bed with a book, reminding
his wife from time to time
that it was raining hard.
Next morning factory-hands
threw up a rope to a sodden
object on the roof. The hus-
band was waiting with heavy
boots on, and it was a miser-
able wreck, sneezing when he
wasn’t groaning, who reeled
away.

“Venturino”: It’s not only
bank people who are suspi-

found in my change a coin the
size of sixpence which puzzled
me. King George’s head was
quite in order, but on the
reverse side was a conglom-
erate design which at first
glance suggested a China-
man’s attempt at writing
Hindustani, though closer
scrutiny showed that it was
an arrangement of acorns and
oak-leaves. I tried it on a
Sydney trammie, who pushed it back, say-
ing, “No Gyppo coins here!” Two barmen
also refused it, but a third with a broad
Yorkshire accent hailed it with delight. “One
o’ the new English sixpences,” he explained.
“Goom, laad, that’s good silver, that is!”
The Australian beer was also good.

“Sol Malaprop”: A resolution has been
introduced into Uncle Hoover’s Senate to
the effect that Uncle should get in early
and claim “Antarctic lands which Rear-
Admiral Byrd and other American explorers
have discovered.” Britain, it was said, laid
claim to a great deal of Antarctica, “includ-
ing regions discovered by American naval
officers as early as 1820 and 1840,” and,
among other outrages which called for
redress, Wilkes Land “has actually been
placed under the Governor-General of Aus-
tralia.” As a matter of fact, it is doubtful
if any American found anything except
snow and ice floating in the Far South until
Byrd flew over some allegedly new regions
the other day. Wilkes was certainly there
about 1840, which was 65 years later than
Cook, and he put Wilkes Land on the map.
Unfortunately his Wilkes Land melted like
many other finds made by people who didn’t
land and prod through the outer skin of
things; the solid Wilkes Land of to-day
is a later and not a Yankee discovery, and
further south. It was named by Austra-
lians in 1912. Wilkes is credited by a
Yankee Dictionary of Biography (Lippin-
cott’s) with having “discovered the Antarc-
tic continent and explored many islands and
coasts.” The part of the continent that he
discovered and the names which he gave
to the islands and coasts remain in obscurity.
He was a descendant of those mythical
heroes who used to conquer a few empires
before breakfast.
“C.Q.”: A couple of years ago Lord

followed at Anglesea. A club called the

of the camps, and for some time it has been

The camp has for honorary architects a
leading city firm. Other firms have offered

“Feng-Shui”: Time was when the
Japanese habit of filch-
ing foreign trade-
marks was regarded
as inveterate. The geta
is on the other foot
now, and the press of
Nippon is expressing
bitter indignation over
the alleged discovery
that unscrupulous
Dutch and Chinese
firms have been selling
their own inferior
goods with Jap chops
on them. There are
some grounds for the
charge. Japanese piece
goods are supreme in
the Dutch East Indies
and in every other
Oriental country where
the tariff dice are not
loaded against them;
aud on the whole they
deserve their position.
No country profited
more than Japan by the
depression which fol-
lowed the war. Manu-
facture became more
efficient and of higher
quality. A generation
ago Nippon was an
almost entirely import-
ing country. She is now in a position to,
export not only haberdashery but locomotives,
cars and heavy electrical machinery. Her
captains of industry are already assuming
American proportions. When Baron Kichi-
zayemon Sumitomo, banker and millowner,
died the other day, the State got 21 million
pounds out of an estate worth £25,000,000.

past it, calling in a jovially derisive manner
as he did so: “Come on ! Give it a* go!

“Port”: The Papuan has nothing to learn
from the Christians who get round the N. S.
Wales Child Endowment Department and
spend the proceeds on beer and _ pictures.
Pleading dire poverty, the inhabitants of
Poreporena, in the Port Moresby bailiwick,
bombarded Gubment with requests for free
rations and remission of taxes. These were
granted, and the care-free folk decided on
a great celebration. The men went out and
brought in vast quantities of fish and native
foodstuffs, while the ladies frisked round with
hats and collected about £5O, all of which
was presently done in on the kai of the white
taubada.
“Si Anu”: The first country to put a
check on the impostors who walk, crawl, hop,
cycle or push wheelbarrows round the world
is the Straits Settlements. Being on the
direct route between Europe and Asia it
sees more of these charlatans than even
Australia. The Penang Court recently fined
Barbara Starck, an Austrian, for being an
alien and having no justification for living-
on the country. She was engaged in cir-
cumnavigating the globe on horseback.

“ Jebenny”: What was probably the first
clash in Australia between the motor-’bus
and older-established means of transport
occurred on the iCobar-Wrightville (N.S.W.)
route. The coach service was doing well
till an enterprising motor-owner happened
along. Unable to compete _ with the faster
aud more comfortable motor-’bus, the coachies
or some sympathiser resorted to a kind of
guerilla warfare, strewing the road with
tacks. The expedient proved effective. The
’bus went off the road for a week, but then
reappeared with stronger tyres, and there-
after it was impervious to tacks. The offen-
sive was then intensified, tacks giving place
to nails and splintered glass. The motor-
owner stuck it for a while, but gradually
curtailed his time-table, and finally threw
in the sponge. No tyre could be devised
that would stand 'a pavement of Jin. nails
and shattered bottles.

“Pluvius”: Cannot the new City Council
do something to remove the stigma that rests
on Sydney of being the wettest metropolis
in the Empire—underfoot, that is—after
rain has fallen? There is hardly a street or
pavement I have traversed during the past
month —and there were 12 inches of rain
in June —where water did not stand about
in the depressions on the surface for hours.
The spacious thoroughfare about Circular
Quay is perhaps the limit; it suggests a
Gruyere cheese or one of the pock-marked
dryblowing flats on Westralian goldfields.
A few years ago some observant alderman
placed it on record that there was scarcely
a street verandah in the city that didn’t
leak in wet weather, and he might truthfully
have added that it would be difficult to find
a street that one can cross dry-footed after
a shower.

ancient Romans pronounced it; it should be
‘gestay.’ ” And when counsel protested that
he had been taught it was “gestee” by an
eminent professor at Sydney Uni., the judi-
cial precisian abruptly said he didn t believe
it. Yet it is entirely probable. English
pronunciation of Latin words was always
arbitrary and depends largely on the taste
and fancy (and race) of the teacher.
modern fashion may be to give ae the ay
sound, but I can testify it was not so m
English public schools and universities a
generation ago. As to how the Romans pro-
nounced their own language, nobody knows
for certain or ever will. There were no
gramophones to preserve the information.
THE BAFFLING GENERATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Three hundred school children were asked ‘What
kind of moving picture do you like?’ Ninety-eight
per cent, of the boys replied, ‘Loved Ninety-four
per cent, of the girls said, ‘War, murder or fight.’ ”

When in a “close-up” of a long embrace
The lovers clutch at last in rapturous
passion,
Who glares enthralled as each gigantic face
Depicts emotion in the movie fashion?
Who gloats upon the hotly tangled pair,
And glows to every simulated thrill?
Who is it sighs in sympathy as
Upon the screen they languish? Is it Jill?
No —Bill!
But when the scene’s of savagery unloosed.
Of human beasts back to the primal slip-
ping;
When men are shot and stabbed and even
noosed
To string to trees; when every reel is
dripping
With blood and every foot’s a cruel fight,
Who is it revels in each murderous mill?
Who marks each massacre with fierce delight,
Agog for greater slaughter? Is it Bill?
No— Jill!
A strange disturbing world, my brothers,
this !
Truly a topsy-turvy generation!
Where is the gentle fair, the fainting miss,
Who viewed our violence with trepidation?
And where the brutal male of ages gone?
A task for a psychologist of skill
To analyse this queer phenomenon,
For, in the name of Complex, which is Jill,
Which Bill?

HIS LIFE WORK.
“Think of Australia and the sports teams it has or has had recently abroad—football, cricket, tennis, billiards, athletics, polo, bowls Sport is good, but it can occupy
too big a place in a country’s life.”— Dr. Hugh Black’s farewell message to Melbourne before returning to New Y ork.
WIFE: “Billy, the bailiffs are here!”
HUSBAND: “Leave me alone—do! Can’t you see I’m busy?”
Business, Robbery, etc.
The tangle that is the N.S.W. bill for
relieving unemployment is slowly sorting
itself out. Here are a few points:—
The employer may deduct 3d. in the £ from all
wages and salaries paid by him and must see that
a stamp is put on the wages sheet to represent
3d. for each £ of wages and salaries paid.
Casual laborers (including casual domestic helps)
escape.
Odd shillings don’t count. The employee who
draws £4 19s. pays only Is.
Domestic servants must pay 3d. a week on their
“keep.”
Employers need not stick a stamp against every,
entry. They may buy one to cover the lot. (But
don’t total the wages sheet. Total only the £
column, otherwise you will be paying on those
add shillings, and deduct altogether payments to
those getting 30s. a week or less.)
“Assessable income” from dividends, etc., are
also taxable 3d. in the £. You will pay on the
basis of your assessable income from July 1, 1929,
to June 30, 1930, less the amount derived from
wages or salary. An assessment notice will be
issued.
If you are a co. with a share register in N. S.
Wales and have shareholders outside the State, you
must charge them 3d. in the £ of all divs. paid
in the 12 months to June 30, 1930, and deduct the
amount from any sum belonging to them that
may come into your hands.
A co. itself pays on the profits it doesn’t distri-
bute, and is allowed six months after the end cf
the fiscal year to do the distributing. (Apparently
the co.’s returns have to be in by August 31; and
at that date it may not know how much it can
distribute. But this seems a small tangle which
can be arranged.)

“Hellish Reef”: The decision of the
Federal Government to spend £50,000 on
the construction of a trawler allegedly to
develop new fishing grounds is fjiecr extra-
vagance at present. Even if it were neces-
sary a good second-hand trawler, four years
old, can be bought and fitted up for £lO,OOO.
If new grounds are discovered it will not
cheapen the price of fish, as the trawler
companies work amicably and see that the
market is not glutted. Incidentally, the. coal
hulk Mombah was sold for £4500 delivery
Sydney after costing £115,000 to build at
Cockatoo. No doubt ex-Treasurer Theodore
will see that Cockatoo gets the work of
building the trawler, and thus he will keep
up his prestige with his Balmain constitu-
ents. With the contracts for the wireless
stations it’s a different tale. To have Aus-
tralian-made would cost £55,000 more, so
the jobs go outside. There are no works
for making wireless stations in Balmain.

These have been busy times for the fire-
insurance man. With values tumbling
wholesale, and merchandise stocks and most
other property hard to sell, it might have
been expected that fires would have been
very numerous. Actually, they have been
Aery few, a*nd the explanation probably lies
in the busy lives the inside men have been
h ading. Every sane company reserves, to
it elf the right to reduce its risk at any time
during the currency of the policy, by refund-
ing the proportionate amount of the pre-
mium, and managers and their confidential
m n have been busy the laest six months
reckoning up, not only shrinkages in market
values, but also what they call the moral
hazard—and that often involes an inquiry
into the history not only of the policy-
holder, but of the policy-holder’s neighbors
—with a view to either cancelling policies
or reducing risks. Experience has shown that
stock which might be very inflammable when
insured for £101)0 becomes positively unburn-
a<ble when the cover on it is cut down to
five or six hundred.

Even more ridiculous than the importa-
tion of wattle-bark is the importation of the

sold to people who are probably not aware
that wattles are grown anywhere outside

The Norwegian Whaling Co., whose base
is at Stewart Island (M.L.), apparently is
not awed by the clamor for restrictions on
its operations in Ross Sea. News has
reached Maoriland that the old Sir James
Clark Ross, the 9900-ton factory ship that
pioneered the co.’s forays in 1923-24 and
continued the voyages south till last year,
is to be superseded this year, by a 20,000-ton
vessel. The new factory ship was launched
last month.

North Westralia was worried when the
Japanese artificially produced pearl-
genuine enough in a fashion, since, like the
real article, it is made by the oyster to
overcome the irritation of an introduced
foreign; substance. H. C. H'opkins, an Eng-
lish expert, claims that he has found a way
of distinguishing one from the other. True
pearls are built up of concentric coats, and
the natural variety differs from the artifi-
cially induced by the way the edges of the
concentric layers of nacre reflect and trans-
mit light. To distinguish this, peculiar
quality Hopkins has devised a special instru-
ment employing the mercury vapor light.

Law and medicine combined to defeat a
compensation claim brought in Perth by an
Italian wood-chopper who had lost four
toes. Medical evidence for the defence
claimed that if the injury had been inflicted
while the boot was on, the big toe. must have
been severed as well. The claimant was
ordered to put on the lacerated boot, and a
needle was run through the leather at the
furthest end of the gash. A couple of.vicious
jabs, the Italian winced, and the claim was
dismissed.

Another testimonial: —
I noticed a par. regarding a long-lived Australian
travelling-rug. When I left my home in Victoria
to embark on what turned out to be my “career,”
my mother bought for me an Onkaparinga rug from
the Mutual Stores. That rug did service in railway
carriages, on crowded hotel floors, on platform seats,
in ’buses and cars, got lost many a time and was
returned in guards’ vans, and generally did the
strenuous rounds of the N.S.W. railways for 17
years; it has been my good companion since I left
the roads, and is still almost as good as when it
was bought. Those who think that Bradford has a
monopoly of good weaving don’t know my rug.

At least one aspect of the strengthened
Australian tariffs is warmly approved in
Papua and New Guinea. This is the
banning of the importation to Australia of
“prepared cocoanut.” The stuff is largely
used in the manufacture of confectionery,
and Ceylon has supplied it in the past. But
firms in Papua apd New Guinea have recently
gone into the trade, and the tariff ban
should result in its being captured by these
two subsidiaries of the Commonwealth.

continental” (Seattle, U.S.A.) : During
my many trips about the National Parks over
here, my Australian rugs have been greatly
admired by tourists [Americans], and lately
the manager of a large and exclusive store
stated that he thought there was a big oppor-
tunity for Australian goods of that class in
this State. I immediately communicated with
the manager of an Australian woollen mill,
All I got was a blase reply that “their out-
put was entirely consumed by local buyers.”
But, though blas6, it was a thoroughly
characteristic reply. I say it with shame —
Australians (with exceptions, of course)
don’t know how’ to write letters. They are
too off-hand, and frequently quite discour-
teous. You can’t win business that way.
And I suppose you want business, I know
I do. That’s what I came here for.

Walter F. Lee, one of the Adelaide Steam-

the collection of photos of sailing-ships and

9000 different windjammers are. represented
in this collection, which is easily the best
thing of its kind in the world—writers like
Basil Lubbock have frequently invoked
Lee’s assistance when compiling records of

mately destined for the archives department

“Disc Harrow”: Australia exported, three
and a half million dozen eggs to Britain last
year. The figures look imposing, but they
represent a mere fraction of England’s needs.
Of every 1000 eggs used in the Cold Country

from China and 121 from Denmark, the
remainder being distributed amongst various

The Federal Government lately dis-
covered that Australians consume less fish
than almost any people in the world, despite
the inexhaustible stores around the coasts,
and proposes to spend £50,000 on a trawler
to give the industry a boost. There is no
question about the immensity of the food
supply which ought to be tapped and isn’t,
but the N.S„W. Government’s incursion into
the business a few years ago was marked by
the pitiful futility and extravagance that
characterises So many State-undertaken enter-
prises. It isn’t only on the eastern coast that
an enormous asset is being neglected or only
imperfectly developed; the waters about
Sharks Bay in Westralia are some of the

Canon W. I. Carr Smith, just dead in
England, was rector of St. James’s, Sydney,
from 1896 to 1909 and sometime chaplain to
Governor Beauchamp as well as to Sydney
Hospital. He was an energetic High Church
cleric who always kept himself well in the
picture; among his other activities he found
time to become one of the earliest members
of the Sydney Clerks’ Union, the credentials
he offered being those of a “clerk in Holy
Orders.” On his departure from Australia
he was made a life member of the organisa-
tion.
“W.W.”: The late John Watt Beattie

practically every mountain peak in Tas-

Solomons and Norfolk Island, are among
the finest of their kind in the world. Beattie’s
other hobby was accumulating relics of the
convict system and historical documents;

Politicians grow in many queer places,
but Jimmy Mitchell is the only Australian
who has gone to the top from a country bank-
manager’s, office. The average c.b.m. has
to keep himself slightly aloof from the mad-
ding crowd and their more or less ignoble
political strife, but Jimmy was always as
keenly interested in wheat and wool and
broad acres and fat cattle as in banking, and
his thorough understanding of the cocky and
his needs made the Northam seat a gift for
him when he decided to contest it a quarter
of a century ago.
Ex-Justice Campbell, of the N. S. Wales
Supreme Court, who was appointed Commis-

investigate certain Mungana and Chillagoe
mining transactions, and whose finding
created a sensation all over the Common-
wealth last week, was called to the N.S.W.
Bar in 1886, and took silk in 1910. As an
advocate lie was engaged principally in
Common Law jurisdiction, and he acted as
Commissioner to inquire into the coal trade
in 1919. In 1922 he was appointed a Judge.
The reference books give the date of his
birth as Nov., 1860. but there was some
argument when he reached the judicial retir-
ing age as to whether his age hadn’t been
inadvertently understated by a year,
although most people have forgotten which
way it was settled. He was born in Argyle-
shire,. and had some pastoral and mining
experiences in Queensland before he turned
to law books.
A. G. (“Smiler”) Hales, who is 70 this
month, could give Horatio Bottomley some
points about Australia if that arresting
figure persists in his intention of coming
this way on a lecturing tour. Among other
things “Smiler” could tell him that Australia
is just about the worst lecture-field in the
world. It is over 30 years since Hales left
this country to make good as a war corres-
pondent in South Africa and later to become
a well-known figure in Fleet-street, where
his vivid writing helped to sell Horatio’s
“John Bull” before the Liberty bonds scan-
dal. When Bottomley started “John Blunt”
Hales was one of the writers on the new
venture with which it was vainly sought to
reproduce the features of the old one. Hales
had hi* shot as a lecturer a dozen years
after his first departure from Sydney.
Died in Wellington, at 84, Bob Hannah,
reputed to be one of Maoriland’s millionaires.
He started out in life with a profound belief
in leather, land and luck. Emigrating from
his native Ulster as a youth, he landed at
Brisbane possessing the clothes he wore and
tenpenco. He was a bootmaker by trade
and work was so hard to find that lie was
almost starving when lie picked up a half-
sovereign. Encouraged by that lie made
another desperate search for a job, got one,
held on to his lucky coin, and added to it
many hundreds of thousands of others, News
of the discovery of gold on the west coast of
Maoriland took him across the Tasman. He
settled for a while in the goldfields village
of Ch a«rlston—now only a memory—and
found it much more profitable to make boots
than to wear them out prospecting. He
established there the business that bears his
name, transferred it to Wellington when gold
petered out in Westland, and devoted his
manufacturing profits to the purchase of city
properties.
George Maddison, who died lately at
Tawonga, Kiewa Valley (Vic.), aged 83, was

when Morgan bailed up the homestead. The
bushranger seized the two best horses, and
took George to guide him across the moun-
tains on his way to the Ovens Valley and
Peeshelba. As Morgan had threatened to
return and shoot the boy if he gave any
information regarding the trip, Maddison
was the reverse of communicative when he
returned to the station next day. The news
that Morgan himself had been shot at
Peechelba a few days later must have been
a relief to the lad.

Mrs. Nancy Purcell, who died the other

When the Coolgardie and Yilgarn elec-
torates in Westralia were amalgamated last
year the two sitting Labor members, George
Lambert and Edwin Corboy, were left to
fight out at the polls the question of which
should survive. Corboy won by a narrow
majority, but Tjambert promptly entered an
objection on the ground that a big parcel of
votes from outside the boundaries of the new
constituency had been admitted, and the
Court of Disputed Returns is wrestling with
the case. Both men have attained some
standing in Labor ranks. Lambert, an old
goldfielder, has sat for Coolgardie since 1913.
Corboy, a Digger, had a brief spell as an
M.11.R. before dropping into the Yilgarn
seat ; he won the Swan division when it
became vacant on John Forrest’s death in
1917, but failed to hold it a couple of years
later against J. H. Prowse (C.PJ, who has
represented it ever since.

T. PI. Dougherty, who struck the final
chord in Brisbane, the other day at 84, was
long a leader in amateur musical circles
there, He arrived from his native Yorkshire
in 1866, and after years in the Civil Service
qualified as a conveyancer, practising his
profession until quite recently. He was one
of the founders of the Musical Union, in
which he led the orchestra for years.
John Jack, dead in Fiji, experienced the
wild life of the Western Pacific in the days
of which Becke and Stevenson wrote. A
Scot, he landed in Fiji in 1870; Cakabau
was then king. When the unsophisticated

and Mclntosh, even to their boots, believ-
ing these to be part of their anatomy, Jack
wms part of the punitive expedition, in which
a brother was killed. He subsequently en-
gaged in storekeeping and planting, until
the deadly tropics cut him down at 86.

affairs.”
A Bligh-street product, top to toe,
What should the blithering likes
Of screened and sheltered Archie know
Of lock-outs or of strikes?
On dust-choked tracks or mud-clogged ruts
’Twas never his to step,
Or hustle round the shearers’ huts
A worried union rep.
What’s his opinion worth about
Industrial ways and laws
Who never heard tough wharfies shout
Dissent or roar applause?
But I—the Book of Life I’ve read
Until there’s naught to hide.
I know the game from A to Z;
I’ve played on either side.
In Labor’s vineyard once I bore
The burden and the heat,
Their trustiest champion, they swore.
I found the incense sweet,
But times must change, and with them we.
’Twas sweeter, I’ll allow,
When grateful Dives handed me
That five-and-twenty thou.
Parties I’ve led and left, until
No more remain to try.
If ever man went through the mill
And knows the ropes, ’tis I.

Australia’s most courageous clergyman
passed through' Melbourne the other day.
He is the Rev. T. Ellison, of Strathfield
Methodist Church, Sydney, and he deserves
to be immortalised on a page where ministers
of the cloth usually make their appearance
only in low-comedy attire.
Mr. Ellison staggered the city by the
Yarra by announcing that while in Paris
he went to the Folies Bergeres. More than
that, he confessed that he thoroughly
enjoyed himself. In addition, he remarked
that the nudity there displayed, and presented
in the artistic manner of the French, did
not distress him at all. He concluded that
the spectacle w T as not likely to do as much
harm to young minds as many of the half-
clad women so often seen on the English-
speaking stage.
Mr. Ellison is hereby presented with the
Thespian D.S.O. He has made a*n impor-
tant contribution to theological science. It
is to be hoped that his remarks will lead
to the better education of the gentlemen
whose chief claim to being different from
their fellow men is the fact that they wear
their collars in 'an unusual way. That
members of the clergy hold depraved ideas
about the stage is largely their own fault.
Melbourne parsons usually only attend the
theatre when they learn that there is an
indecent performance going on. The last
time the churches attended a show en masse
was when sundry eminent newspaper critics
declared “Cradle Snatchers” a dirty play.
* * *
“Mr. Cinders,” at Sydney Majesty’s, is a
new comedian named Hindle Edgar. There
is also a musicomedy of that name in which
he and a few score others appear, and which
drags a good deal, especially in the second
half. Still, it has, for musicomedy, a sound
story, and there are plentiful helpings of
catchy and wavy music, and even a portion
of inherent comedy. It offers also an abund-
ance of dancing, solo, duo, trio and masso;
reedy but sufficient voices, and competent
individual acting by about a dozen players,
with a fresh and refreshing chorus ready to
dart on and fill the precincts with a glamor
of waving legs and a glitter of smiling teeth
at any moment. And the jokes include just
enough splendid chestnuts to be satisfying.
The piece is yet another child of that pro-
lific maiden Cinderella. It differs from all
its sisters in being a boy. “Mr. Cinders”
is “Cinderella” masculine gender. He is
Jim, poor-relation cousin in the home of
S'George and Lady Lancaster (woman-
bled man and man-blooded woman), wmiting
on his snob cousins Lumley and Guy and
acting rouseabout generally. Then from the
lake at Merton Chase he fishes out, half-
drowned, American millionaire Henry Kemp,
who has bought the adjoining Towers. Jill,
hastening to Merton to see how much the
dip affected pa, knocks a policeman into a
ditch, changes into the clothes of a slavey
just reporting to Merton for duty, and in
this guise meets the nitwit, not-as-big-a-goat-
as-lie-looks Jim, whilst her cousin, helping
her to avoid the law, allows the Lancasters
to think she is the gilded heiress, and set
their nets accordingly. A ball at the Towers
sees the Lancasters arrive in their chariots,
except the male Cinderella, who, however, is
AMY ROCHELLE, in the “Country Girl” revival at
Melbourne Royal.
meanwhile got up as the Earl of Ditchem
by Jill and sent along in a pumpkin dis-
guised as a> motor-bike —to go down weLl at
the ball until a diamond necklace is found
in his pocket. After that the piece moves
at slow motion for a while, but livens again
before the inevitable happy end. It is the
first new show staged at Her Majesty’s for
many moons, and it compares favorably and
a bit over with most of the items the Firm
has lately been dragging from its bottom
drawer.
It is Edgar who makes the show more
worth seeing than the best of recent fustian
and brocade. He is altogether a new com-
edian. There is no one in Australia who at
all resembles him. He does not depend upon
odd looks; his face, in the language of that
great theatrical critic Queen Victoria, does
not amuse us. Indeed, the gallery girl whom
present writer consulted considered him good
looking. He has no physical deformities and
doesn’t fake any with outsize boots or such-
like props. His voice is normal, ditto his
clothes. He has an uproarious line of
athletics, but can be uproariously funny
without them. He rushes in on skates and
introduces himself by “presenting his
western facade to the shuddering stars.”
He enters clad in a pyjama coat and a
merely sufficient cask. He converts a
top-hat into a football, does some classy
dribbling rushes and finally goes over in
the corner for a try. He winds up the
play by smashing the Lancaster breakfast
crockery piece by piece. He does other things
that look equally hackneyed and dull on
paper. As he does them they look new;
they are funny, and they are also things a
person like Jim might be expected to do.
But Edgar manages more than that with
the rsle. Jim, as well as being a butt, has
to be the hero. Edgar makes that of him.
After all his goat-acting there is nothing
incongruous in his collecting the heiress.
It is a joyous change from the usual arrange-
ment under which the funmaker has to carry
the tailor’s dummy hero throughout the
early proceedings and fade away so that the
t.d. can fill the air with gush in the end.
Gush is conspicuously absent from the offer-
ing, though there is plenty of sentiment, an
ingredient cleverly mixed into his comedy by
Edgar, and further effectively used by Elsie
Prince. Miss Prince’s Jill matches even
Edgar’s Jim. She is a vastly improved
little lady from the one who was in Fullers’
American trifles a year or two ago. Hers
and Edgar’s is a side-splitting and touch-
ing joint effort. Miss Prince has ac-
quired a veneer of polish somewhere. She
doesn’t altogether depend upon skirt-lifting
for her comedy now, and when she goes into
Cockney it almost sounds like a lapse.
Sonny Ray is another bright newcomer,
though he plays always to the audience, and
Kathleen Fallow and Frank Leighton are
fresh and decorative. Maidie Hope might
be a trifle less blatantly shrewish without
any loss of her vinegary prestige.
# * *
“Let’s Get Married Again” is only half
the show at Sydney Palace. When Nellie
Bramley moved in there from the Opera
House on Saturday she carried with her a
stupendous orchestra of some half-dozen
notable artists, liable to down instruments
and burst into song without notice. First of
all they chortled iu concert, then singly,
direct and via megaphone. Then a member
of the company, secreted in a prominent
position in one of the boxes, suddenly lifted
voice in an unmistakable rendering of
“Mighty Like a Rose.” The peak effort was
that of an usherette, who mounted a spring-
board above the orchestral pit a*nd warbled
nicely of something or other. The leader of
the orchestra, who is also its first violin,
walked down that springboard at the open-
ing of hostilities, after coming out through
the curtain split with his fiddle and an air
of surprise, fie was back on the stage again
later, when he led on his merry men to
provide the music for a party and a specialty
dance by a lady of the cast, and the last
recollection taken away was of the same
crew, set amongst red and purple and blue
and yellow and rose electric globes, playing
the audience out with that suggestive march
number “God Save the King.” An offer by this
Showman to do a tumbling turn through
the stalls or play a selection from “Entrance
of the Gods into Valhalla” on the springs of
seat 12, d.-c., was reluctantly, but unani-
mous 1 y, declined.
Why? It seems
rather unfair not to
let the audience do
a bit, too.
The play itself has
its own share of
variety. There are
bits of the making
of a movie; high,
medium and low
comedy; at least two
love affairs; an un-
dressing scene (this
Showman, however,
will still back the
Taliaferro against all
comers) ; a bedroom
scene ; a d r.u n k
scene; mistaken
identity; impromptu
gagging; slapstick,
wit and even humor.
Then there is a
story. Gloria, film
star, finds on her
wedding day «that
her husband had
already made
arrangements t o
commit his first infi-
delity ; leaves him;
returns to act oppo-
site him in complet-
ing a film they were
making; and permits
herself to be worked
up to the point of
passing the incred-
ible remark from
which the play takes
its title. Some
companies of this
Showman’s acquaint-
ance would make of
it a play that could
be completely de-
scribed by merely
writing “typical
Avery Hopwood”; Nellie Bramley and her
varied support somehow turn it into a per-
formance that makes Hopwood’s name on
the programme look like a misprint. The
eo. seems to have its own audience, and when
present writer looked in was getting a hearty
hearing.
Continuing the hard work of providing a
new show a week, Miss Bramley turns on
Saturday to “Beware of Widows.”
ft ft ft
Alexander Watson, who turned up in
Sydney again at the King’s Hall on Satur-
day night, represents the ultimate economy
of showmanship. His stock-in-trade com-
prises a pleasant voice, an expressive face
and a retentive memory, and with these he
can entertain an audience as effectively as
could a whole company of mummers equipped
with costumes, scenery and spotlights. Wat-
son has mastered English—the most difficult
tongue in the world to speak correctly—and
several of its dialec-
tic variants. A con-
densation of Barrie’s
“L i 111 e Minister”
and some pieces by
A. A. Milne and
other gentle humor-
ists made up the
first Sydney pro-
gramme. Ever y
item went well.

A fiddler who
might have been
billed as Russki
Muscovitsky or Pabh>
Carranza, but pre-
ferred to stick to
his own name, which
is John Dunn, has
been giving recitals
at Sydney Con. His appearance is more
romantic than his name—lie’s a dead ringer
for R. L. Stevenson. He has an effortless style
and a full tone on all registers, plays Bach,
Beethoven and Tschaikowsky divinely, and
falls short of liis ideals only when he
attempts superhuman feats of virtuosity,
such as bowing Paganini’s “Moto Perpetuo”
in octaves! A good showman wouldn’t have
attempted the feat, but Dunn isn’t much of
a_ showman, and he illustrated his conscien-
tiousness as a musician by apologising to his
audience for the not very noticeable short-
comings of the attempt. That’s new and
refreshing.

This Showman offers his meek congratu-
lations to broadcasting station 2UW, Syd-
ney, on its handling of the Test matches.
Whatever the. method employed, a convincing
illusion is created that the play is being-
broadcast from the English ground by a
speaker with a good knowledge of the game
and a keen dramatic sense. It all raises
an ancient doubt in present writer’s head.
What percentage of the interest in these
games is interest in sport? Isn’t most of it
that inherent thing patriotism, fed by the
drama that undoubtedly exists in the
motion, sudden-change nature of cricket?
Nobody listening in can enjoy the game as a
game of skill; but, as broadcast, there is no
doubt about its entertaining qualities.

Allan Wilkie, who has haunted the suburbs
in Sydney showings for years, set out to
try a city address on Saturday, when he
opened at the Opera House with “The
Jealous Wife.”- This Showman will deliver
reserved judgment on the conspiracy next
week, without, he hopes, causing the keeper
of the box office to resign. To-morrow
(Thursdav) afternoon Wilkie stages “The
Merchant/’ with “Hamlet” on the following
Thursday,. Among other promised items to
follow is a play of Bligh’s Sydney.

Glorious Austral continued to sing last
week to audiences that filled the organ gal-
lery and overflowed on to the stage at Mel-
bourne Town Hall. One of the most loudly-
applauded items was “Mighty Ocean,” over
which the present critic’s Sydney colleague
displayed a regrettable spirit o'f levity. There
was no excuse for him concentrating his
venom on this particular piece. Its words
are well up to the standard of most of the
others Madame Austral sings. They all
seem to have been translated from foreign
languages by “Bellerive.”
Looking like a mixture of a good-natured
Aussie and the angel Gabriel, John Amadio
returned to the concerts towards the end,
and the spectacle of two of its children show-
ing such consummate artistry on one and
the same stage enraptured Melbourne quite
beyond w-ords. The flute appears to have
none of its usual limitations in Amadio’s
hands. He can give a “ping” to every note
of a Mozart sonata which only a piano is
supposed to be able to do.
An enormous crowd rushed the bar-
riers at the Town Hall on Saturday
night to witness Austral’s final flurry with
Amadio and the Uni. Orchestra. The enter-
tainment was as mixed as a broadcasting
programme; the encores stretched it out to
interminable length, and the more there were
the worse they got and the worse they got
the more applause they received. It was a
breathless evening, anyhow, and glorious;
and the orchestra’s accompaniment to Aus-
tral’s singing of Senta’s ballad from “The
Flying Dutchman” was a model of restraint,
though its solo item, the overture there, was
a trifle above its collective head.

Melbourne Market Report:—
Two more revivals took Melbourne’s fancy
at the week-end. Dull trading conditions
have become almost commonplace among
merchants handling new musical comedy,
straight comedy, vaudeville and farce, and
the curtailing of overhead such as scene-
shifter.s, electricians and ushers has gone
about as far as it could go. Also, the endea-
vor to find a substitute for orchestras has
not had the favorable result expected, tinned
goods not being in strong demand. So man-
agements have probably been wise in turn-
ing over old stock, though the tendency may
easily be overdone. “The Country Girl”
was offered in one parcel at the Royal, and
KATHLEEN FALLOW, with the bright “Mr. Cinders”
at Sydney Majesty's sho
at Bs. 6d„ 4s. 6d„ ; tc plus tax, bidding was
brisk. Goods ty£ ne( j\Aut to be extraordin-
arily fresh, eyif u a pawing for their age.
Although therft, has been no mention of them
in the tariff schedule, there was a
marked absence of imported female stars,
and their non-arrival was not deplored, there
being no unfavorable reaction against Gw’yn-
neth Laseelles, Mary Lawson, Marie Brem-
ner and Amy Rochelle because they bore
the brand “Australian-made.” The local
ballet was as dainty a line of softgoods as
has been offered for many months.
Owing to reluctance of buyers to operate,
a quieter tone has been apparent at the
Comedy for some time, but it disappeared
on Saturday when “Tea for Three” was
brought down. Leon Gordons and Ann
Davises rose sharply from somewhere near
zero to several points above par, and Frank
Bradleys remained steady at their usual
high figure. Inquiries for Harvey Adamses
were slight, but the market closed with the
highest quotations experienced since the
season began.
The only absolutely fresh line was “Pot
Luck” at the Tivoli. This is a South Aus-
tralian product, bearing the Kenneth Duf-
field brand. Mr. Duffield has not permitted
himself any revolutionary experiments, and
the small investor is likely to be attracted
by his musical stocks and shares, especially
with the added inducement of the eight baby
dolls, who proved to be magnificent examples
of Australian flapperhood, very clean, prime,
sweet and free from smut or other blemish.
The demand for chaff, however, showed a
weakened tendency, a packet of Alfred
Friths not being well received. This com-
modity has been absent from the market for
some time, and interest in it had been roused
to fever-heat, but it quickly declined on the
discovery being made that, the quality had
considerably deteriorated. Owing to the
good reception' of Nell Flemings, however,
the market quickly firmed.
On the whole, the investing public has
plenty of good lines to chose from, if little
money to spend.
The Palette
Three dozen Sir Frank Short etchings
make a fine show at the Bennett Galleries,
Sydney. “The. New Moon” —receding river,
with men fishing in the foreground, high
gable and heavy dark tree in the mid-dis-
tance and an admirably treated sky—is
present observer’s selection, though the
larger pieces after Turner and De Wint
made any choice difficult. A striking thing
about the show is that practically every
topic chosen by the artist is worthy of the
art expended on it.
At the Beaux Arts’ Melbourne, W. Dela-
field Cook is showing landscapes in tempera.
Tempera is Chinese white and water-color
mixed with gum, and was abandoned for oils
by the Van Eycks, Hubert and Jan, in the
fourteenth century, and painters as a body
have followed their lead. Mr. Cook’s arrival is
rather like a cocky abandoning his motor
truck in favor of a bullock-waggon. Some of
his artistic dishes are comparatively palat-
able, but they would probably have been
better if cooked in oil.
With a courage befitting their years, a
dozen young men and maidens calling them-
selves the Embyros have been displaying their
wares at the Little Gallery, Melbourne. Pre-
sent writer’s only complaint is against that
title.. According to Funk and Wagnall, an
embryo is the germ or rudimentary form of
anything in its earliest development. There
is no record in Nature or in art of a germ
or rudimentary form having skipped a stage
in its development and successfully got away
with it, but Constance Parkin, a brilliant
Nat. Gallery scholarship-winner, already dis-
plays the dangerous facility of a Royal
Academician, and James Flett is artistically
a cockerel attempting to crow like a full-
blown rooster. The most promising thing
about this show is its evidence of whips
of talent, and when the owners have dis-
covered that their job is not to shock but
to learn they may do something memorable.

This Week’s Investment Tip.
I am an invalid, terrified of a penu-
rious old age. Provision was made for
me by investments in Government stock
and certain pref. shares, chosen for
security. (1) What effect would note
inflation have on such investments?
(2) Can I make my position more
secure? —-Service Department In-
quiry.
There is a certain amount of note
inflation at present; that is to say, an Aus-
tralian note is at a heavier discount in
London than the cost of transhipping
demands'. The effect of this inflation is
obvious. A security on which 5 p.c. was
regarded as a good return 18 months ago is
expected to show from 6 to p.c. now.
This means that, in the investor’s opinion,
six Australian notes are worth no more
than five were at the beginning of last
year.
That is the effect of small and, so to
speak, incidental inflation. Deliberate in-
flation (and inflation breeds inflation) has
the same effect carried on indefinitely. Until
the currency reorganisation after 1922 it
took a roll of notes in Germany to pay for
a tram ride.
The sufferers in Germany at that time
were investors with a fixed capital interest
in an asset of any description. The man
with 10,000. marks in Government stock
found that his scrip, though still nominally
worth 10,000 marks, would hardly pay for
a week’s board. People who lent money on
mortgage were in the same boat; likewise
depositors with savings and other banks.
Holders of pref. shares were no better off:
their interest was in the fixed capital and
not in the inflated profit.
They were the losers; who were the
gainers? Broadly, all debtors and owners
of equities. Germany practically relieved
itself of domestic debt. France went a good
way in the same direction; and it is certain
that a very large section of the TJ.S.A.
thought Britain a great fool not to do some-
thing of the same sort. But, of course, it
didn’t.
The question has been raised whether
Australia could indulge in inflation and sub-
sequent reconstruction on its own account.
It could. Inflation is a purely domestic
matter; it,affects paper only, and a country’s
paper doesn’t interest the outsider —inter-
national dealings are only in gold or on a
gold basis.
Owners of equities before mentioned in-
clude mortgagors and holders of ordinary
shares in cos. with pref. capital or other
pref. creditors.
But while that is the position in the
event of inflation, there is no reason at all
to expect that it will be pursued as a policy
in Australia; One. strong guarantee against
it is the great number of savings bank
depositors in Australia—easily the most
in the world in proportion to population.
For every 1000 of the population of Aus-
tralia there were 746 Savings Bank deposits
in 1928; and though a good many
people have two or more accounts, the figure
is astonishing, nevertheless. Inflation of
the note issue reduces the value of every
bank deposit, and if carried far enough
eventually wipes it out altogether. When
that is realised it will take a very bold
or a very reckless politician to recommend
inflation.

Keen management, a vigorous reorganisation
of manufacturing methods and the husband-
ing of finances are the chief factors respon-
sible for the co.’s very substantial progress
over the last eight years. As new processes
and other improvements are discovered, the
co. instals them, thus livening its output
and reducing costs. In this and other ways
it has gained a very firm hold on the glass
trade here and in Maoriland. A couple of
years ago new automatic bottle-making
machines were installed in each of the co.’s
five Australian factories, and the Auckland
plant was duplicated—the Dominion Govern-
ment granted the co. a trifle more protection.
Immediately there was a spring of £23,084
in the admitted net earnings; that was for
the 12 months to the close of accounts in
1929.
Last year further progress was made with
the production and sale of glass containers ;
also the Australian rights in a new machine
for capping and sealing these was bought.
The price is not mentioned; it was appa-
rently charged up to earnings, the goodwill
item (£114,500) remaining unchanged. But
orders fell off towards the close of accounts,
and the exhibited gross profit (£385,844)
was £46,552 lighter than the previous year's.
Exes. (£198,676) were got back £25,827,
reducing the net contraction to £20,725.
Still, after handing the prefs. their £15,750,
enough profit remained to show 18.3 p.c. on
the £930,478 of ord. capital compared with
20.6, 18.2, 17.6 and 16.3 p.c. back to 1926.
The 2i p.c. bonus that was sent out with
the TO p.c. div. in the previous year was
repeated, with a warning that this sweetener
may be dropped at the end of the current
term.
Although quieter trading conditions can
be expected to further reduce earnings, they
have recently been very comfortably in excess
of distributions; and the co. may be expected
to hold its big share of the business in a well-
protected market. Moreover everything is
not on view. Of recent years substantial
additions have been made to plant and
charged up to earnings, and then from the
same source the asset has been liberally
written down. Thus at the close of last

Finances are snug. The growth of £68,811
in the book value of cash, investments, etc.,
is mainly on account of the new subsidiary,
Australian Window Glass Pty., Ltd., which
is to manufacture sheet glass. Plant for
the purpose is now being installed at Sydney,
but production is to be delayed until present
heavy stocks of the imported article are
worked down. The total cost of the new
works will be about £200,000. The other sub-
sidiary, the Crown Crystal Co., which turns
out blown, pressed and cut glass, is appa-
rently not yet contributing to the pool, but
recent tariff adjustments have greatly en-
hanced its prospects.

Three years ago it was decided to rebuild
the co.’s main premises; five storeys were
added, and the work was completed early
in the last term. But the inevitable dislo-
cation and disturbance and the interest on
a lot of money represented by premises
that were not bringing in any return bit
deeply into earnings for the two years to
March 31, 1929. Hence the 5 p.c. bonus,
which had been an annual event for six years,
was dropped, leaving the div. at 10 p.c.
Last year trading conditions changed;
money suddenly became scarcer and dearer
and spending was restricted. Nevertheless,
Mark Foy’s business held well, but the
added cost of trading from larger premises
and the taxgatherer’s more voracious appe-
tite ate into takings. Gross profit
(£389,818) was £3738 lighter. Ordinary
trading exes. (£313,459) were £7175 heavier,
and an extra £4OOO went out in interest on
the overdraft; thus the recession in the net
result was £14,913. After handing the prefs.
their £16,374, the balance of the year’s net
profit was a wink under 9 p.c. on the half-
million of ord. capital compared with 11.9,
16.9, 24.6, 20.3 and 23.6 p.c. back to 1925,
so a couple of points were chipped off the
div., reducing it to 8 p.c.
The current year’s results will depend
largely upon the extent to which overhead
can be got down. The conditions which put
the glitter into the figures of a few years
ago have disappeared, prices are on the
down grade and the tax bill will be heavier.
On the other hand the co. has built up a
lively turnover on small profit margins,
mainly for cash; it manufactures much of its
own requirements and has an extensive good-
will, of which no account is taken in the
books. But there is a heavy overdraft
(£342,912 at March 31) calling for reduction,
and that may stand in the way of an
increase in the div. for a while.
Here is the position as balance-sheet
figures disclose it: —

In order to add £49,673 to the book value
of fixed assets and snip £7204 off 'the
amount Coming to trade creditors, the board
tacked £52,041 on to the overdraft and
drew upon more or less liquids for £17,351
net last year. Thus the more or less liquid
surplus (£240,983, including stocks), was
£62,188 lighter than at the previous balance.
On the market the ords., which fetched
495. a year ago, dropped sharply from 31s.
to 255. following publication of accounts.
At the latter price the return is 6.4 p.c.
on an 8 p.c. div. basis; the backing amounts
to 31s. sd. in net tangibles. The prefs.,
which carry a fixed cumulative 6 p.c. and
have priority as to capital, are priced at
18s. 6d.; at which figure they return 6.5
p.c. The net tangible cover is £3 17s. 7d.,
and last year’s net profit was over 31
times their annual requirements.

Last year was full of trouble for this old-
established paper-importing house. The
factor mainly responsible for the drop in
profits was the , falling-off in turnover, due
to general depression, while the position in
the exchange market added to the difficulties.
Incidentally, the co. has a subsidiary in
London, and in normal times dabbled a little
in exchange business itself. After attending
to the pref. requirements, the balance of the
year’s net result was a whisper over 10 p.c.
on average ordinary capital compared with
12, 12, 13.6 and 13.2 p.c. back to 1926.
The co. continues to get its full share of
whatever business is offering. Of recent
years it has been able to make a very com-
fortable showing without putting every
ha’penny on the table. Whether last year’s
earnings were better or worse than stated
cannot be ascertained from the published
accounts. All that can be said definitely is
that the co. has a very conservative board,
which graduated in the business, as well
as extensive connections for its newsprint
agencies.
Balance-sheet figures show the solid
nature of the financial structure.

Out of net assets totalling £985,112 the more
or less liquid surplus (including shares in
other cos. and stocks) amounted to no less
than £884,792, which was £10,366 greater
than at the previous balance. The other
£110,319 was represented by premises, worth
a lot more than their book value. • Stocks
increased £25,356 and are higher than at
any time since 1921. Still, they were less
than Si times last year’s net profit; their
moderate size is partly explained by the
fact that much of the co.’s business is done
on an indent basis. They are taken in at
replacement cost or less, and provision has
been made for any decline in their market
value, the chairman says. The drop of
£21,582 in book debts is another indication
of sluggish trade conditions.
Shares in other cos., etc. (£265,071, down
£101,819 during the year), includes an un-
specified holding in the London subsidiary,
but more than half of that item was repre-
sented by Government securities at the close
of last accounts. No hint is given as to
what extent, if any, the pup contributes to
the pool. But since no part of the div. paid
each year has been declared to be earned
outside Australia, and therefore free of local
income tax, it looks as if whatever may be
sent along is accumulating as reserves,
hidden or disclosed.
One thing likely to affect the co. in the
future is the manufacture of newsprint in
Australia. The pound ords. are backed by
net tangibles with a book value of 295. The
market prices them at 275., at which figure
the return is 7.4 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis.
The strongly-protected 5 p.c. prefs., which
participate in new ord. share issues, seldom
appear on the market.

*Loss. f Surplus.
You do not need to look twice at that table
to know that the business is sick. Over
the last four years the net result of opera-
tions in the Ordinary branch was a surplus
of £7952, and in the Industrial branch a
loss of £lOlO.
The do. was registered in Sydney in
January, 1923. There were changes in the
control in Sept., 1924, but when the books
closed three months later only £2208 of the
£42,564 put up by shareholders remained
intact, and a mere £5590 had been gathered
in premiums during the year.
Though the new business figures have
since annually increased, and a determined
effort has been made to get costs down, not
much real progress has been made. Heavy
lapses are the trouble. During the five years to
Dec. 31, 1929, assurances totalling £1,074,644
were put on the books in the Ordinary
branch. This business represents an annual
premium income of £41,740; yet only £17,491
of premiums were gathered last year; there
was another £lB2B to come in on new poli-
cies. Claims account for only a very small
part of the difference.
Nor does the position appear to be im-
proving much in this respect: —
1926. 1927. 1928. 1929.
Assurances . . £154,271 £216,550 £261,340 £294,354
First premiums 4,959 7,309 7,533 5,874
Renewals . . 5,706 6,861 9,858 11,617
Interest, etc. 72 137 204 82
Thus, although the ratio of exes, to net pre-
miums has been got down from 76.9 p.c. in
1927 to 66.2 p.c. last year, the cost of put-
ting new policies on the books has risen
from 136.6 p.c. of the first premiums in
1927 to 192 p.c. last year. That is assum-
ing that new business is 10 times more costly
than renewals. For the most part these
lapses are a dead loss to both policy-holders
and the co. Whether the eo. can manage
to pull through will very largely depend
upon how soon this drift can be arrested.
Last year the co. bought the Industrial
business of the Federal Building Assurance
Co. (in liquidation) for £4952, and that
amount was capitalised as goodwill. The
Industrial premium income for the 12
months to Dec, 31 improved £4339, reach-
ing. £11,419, of which claims took £1284 and
exes. £9740, or 85.2 p.c. of the premiums
as against 115.1 p.c. the year before. Thus
a small surplus of £395 was registered as
against a loss of £1429 in 1928. Fire pre-
miums, etc., amounted to £1744, but the
risks were practically all reinsured. The
aggregate surplus from all sections of the
business was £4003, or £2139 more than the
previous year’s.
The financial position is obviously unsatis-
factory :

You do not need to look twice at that table
(o be convinced that the-board’s policy is to
build up strength during the co.’s infancy.
Since policy-writing began eight years ago
the co. lias scattered its risks throughout
the Australian States, Southern Asia, East
Indies and South Sea Islands. Also it has
an office at Montreal and another at Lon-
don. Shareholders have had an average of
4.5 p.c., and, after paying for establishment,
furniture and stationery out of revenue,
in excess of the £60,000 specifically
set aside to cover unexpired risks had been
accumulated to support £93,825 of paid capi-
tal at March 31.
Shareholders are thus in a very snug posi-
tion. During the 12 months to the close of
last accounts interest and rents alone brought
in £11,085, which was £552 more than for the
previous year and equal to 11.8 p.c. on capi-
tal. So despite the very poor underwriting
result the 7 p.c. div. remained an easy
matter—so easy that prospects of something
better are very bright indeed. Much of the
co.’s success is explained by the fact that
the control consists chiefly of the directors
and executive officers of the highly successful
Queensland Insurance Co.; also the friendly
interest taken in the business by the big
Burns-Philp organisation has helped greatly.
The next table shows how the business
has progressed since the beginning:—

was due mainly to the co.’s withdrawal from
the marine business in London. When the
bottom fell out of shipping values after the
war, competition got an edge on it, rates
were cut to the bone and marine busi-
ness generally has remained unsatisfactory
since. The recent sharp rise in the loss rate
—last year’s 65.9 p.c. was the heaviest the
co. has sustained—has been a common experi-
ence, and it is doubtful to what extent, if
any, relief need be looked for in the matter
of fire losses in the near future. The year’s
underwriting surplus (£2911) fell back to
1.6 p.c. of the net premiums compared with
3.8, 7.S and 8.3 p.c. in the three preceding
years. It would have been better but for the
marine experience in London, the chairman
says, and future results are expected to
benefit from the policy now adopted.
Policy-holders have no need to stay awake
at night. At March 31 they could see re-
serves equal to approximately 55 p.c. of the
year’s net premiums, and that is 15 p.c. more
than is usually considered adequate. Total
funds (capital and reserves combined) were
over 1J times the year’s exceptional losses,
and shareholders can bo called upon to dredge
up another £93,825 if need be. There was
£85,084 coming to creditors, including provi-
sion for contingencies, and the co. had
£163,609 in Government securities and cash
to meet it. Book debts, etc., totted up
to £42.746, and freeholds were in at £74,041.
The net tangible backing amounts to 40s.
2d. per pound of paid capital.
Bournda, near Bega (N.S.W.), is enjoy-

It would be better to put down one or two

rate, are not promising.

Akmana- New Guinea Gold, one of the
many shows floated in Australia to seek the
pot of gold at the rainbow’s foot in the
Islands, has resolved to give the land of
Brown Brother a miss. The expedition sent
there by the co. has failed to locate anything
worth taking up. The directors now
announce that the co. has pegged and applied
for 200 acres in (he Tumut (N.S.W.) dis-
trict. For the most part this ground has
not been worked previously, owing to heavy
water, but ground sluicers are said to have
got returns up to 6s. per yard from the lower
end of the area. Akmana is to have the
area scout bored, and, if promising, close
bored. Vendor’s consideration is to be in
f.p. shares, and that only when the co. is
satisfied the ground is worth equipping with
a bucket dredge or other treatment plant.

Shareholders in Kimberley Options got a
scare when the manager reported the reef
cutting out in the bottom of the shaft, at
15ft. from surface, and the bea*rs had a
busy time. Still, it is rash to conclude the
reef has gone altogether at that shallow
depth; it is lenticular in character, so there
is a good chance of further lenses.

Alluvial Tin has decided to shut down
the dredges of nine of its subsidiaries for
two months at least in the next quarter. The
mines affected are Rawang Tin Fields, Kun-
dang, Ivampar Tin Fields, Ivramat, Jelapang,
Kampong Lanjut, Changkat, Larut Tin
Fields and Rawang Concessions. During May
and June last this group produced 1053 tons
of tin oxide, so the stoppage should have an
appreciable effect upon output. The resolu-
tion was made at a Sydney meeting repre-
sentative of over 20 Australian cos. produc-
ing altogether from 18,000 to 20,000 tons
of ore annually; the idea is to cut this year’s
output down to 80 p.e. of last year’s. Of the
other concerns in agreement, Katu and
Renong have followed suit, and the remainder
will do so as soon as the necessary arrange-
ments can be made. At least half a dozen
shows not represented at the meeting have
put up the shutters, some of'them indefinitely;
so the scheme of the London Tin Producers’
Association should get a fair trial, especially
as the results of Bolivian and Dutch co-
operation should soon be making themselves
felt.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.) .
Any rich deposits of scheelite in Aus-
tralia? If so, where? Latest market price?
Uses? Where can particulars regarding
deposits being worked at present be secured?
—7450.
The term, “rich” can only be used in a
relative sense, depending largely on the world
price of tungsten, of which scheelite is an
ore. When the cheaply won tungsten ores of
China are depleted, many deposits not now
being worked will be considered rich. The
most important deposits of scheelite in Aus-
tralia are at Hillgrove (N.S.W.), Garada
(Q.), Koltong (Vic.), Pilbara, Yalgoo and
Yilgarn Goldfields (W.A.) and King Island
(Tas.). The principal producing States are,
in order of . importance, Tasmania and
N. S. Wales. Latest quotation (London,
June 13) was 18s. 3d. per unit of tungstic
oxide (pure scheelite contains 80.55 per
cent, tungstic oxide). Tungsten is extracted
from scheelite, the former being used in
special steels and alloys for use in high-
speed engines and instruments requiring
special toughness. Pure tungsten is used for
filaments in electric lamps, contact points
and electrodes in thermonic valves. Sodium
tungstate is employed as fire preventive on
cloth and timber and as a mordant in dye-
ing. Full Information concerning individual
deposits could be obtained by direct applica-
tion to the Departments of Mines in in-
dividual States.
(1) Is platinum obtained commercially in
Q’land? (2) How are alluvial and sea-
beach platinum claims worked? (3) Price?
—7535.
(1) No. (2) The working of alluvial
and sea-beach claims is described in the last
annual report of the New Zealand Mines
Department. Water delivered under pres-
sure from pump is directed on to the face
of sand and gravel, the material broken
down by the water is lifted by pump and dis-
charged through a screen on to tables lined
with matting for saving the gold and plati-
num. (31 Last available quotation, £lO per
ounce. The N.Z. platinum obtained as above
is valued in the N.Z. mineral returns at
£7 10s. per ounce.
(1) How can jarosite pigment he distin-
guished by a novice from other clays? (2)
Would the Vic. Mines Dept, analyse a
sample, and what would he the fee? (3)
What standard must jarosite attain to find
a market? (4) Value? —7677.
(1) Jarosite is a mineral from which red
iron oxide can be manufactured. It is
usually found as a yellow earthy substance
consisting of minute crystals or crystalline
grains. Heated in a blowpipe flame on
charcoal it becomes black and magnetic;
heated in a closed tube it gives off water and
then sulphuric acid. (2) Vic. Mines Dept,
will identify the mineral free of cost, but
an analysis will cost £2 2s. (3) No fixed
standard, but quality will be governed by
percentage of impurities (sand, clayey
matter, etc.). (4) Market value will depend
upon color and condition of red oxide pro-
duced by roasting. It is possible that the
liberated potash salts could be recovered as
a by-product and used as a fertiliser. No
Australian works for the treatment of jaro-
site are known to us.
(1) Extent of oil shale deposits in Tas-
mania? (2) Annual value of oil produced?
7370.
(l)The Latrobe-Railton-Kimberley, Oonali,
and other more or less explored areas have
an estimated 40 million tons. Other deposits,
known to be large, have not had extent
determined. (2) For 1927 the output was
3150 tons, valued at £2050, largest producer
being the Australian Shale Oil Corporation
at Latrobe. Practically nothing is being
done at present.
(1) Any market for diatomaccous earth
( tripolite ) ? (2) Principal uses? (3)
Approximate commercial value on rails
Sydney?- —7159.
(1) The demand for diatomite (diato-
maceous earth, tripolite, etc.) is limited. The
Austral Hock Milling Co., Ltd.. Gladstone-
street, Newtown,/ and Mineral Earths, Ltd.,
264 Botany-road, Alexandria, might be com-
municated with in regard to a market. (2)
Diatomite is used as an abrasive, chiefly in
polishing powders and scouring soaps, as a
filtering medium in certain manufacturing
industries, and in oil refineries. Diatomite
also makes an efficient heat-insulating
medium suitable for boiler coverings, stove
linings, walk fillings, etc. (3) £3 to £4 per
ton f.o.b. trucks.
Price ,in Sydney of magnesite? Demand
for same?— 7l44.
Ranges from £2 10s. to £3 per ton in
Sydney for mineral containing over 94 p.c.
magnesium carbonate. Demand limited, as

deposits of their own.
Two agents have been travelling our S.Q.
district representing Pacific Tobacco Indus-
tries ( Australasia ), Ltd., selling shares to

Is it manufacturing cigarettes in Australia?
(3) What sort of an investment is it? —
7459.
(1) Registered in N.Z. (2) No. (3)
Co.’s primary intentions were to' culti-
vate and market tobacco leaf in N.Z. It
bought land there on terms at £25 an acre
(total cost, £28,925). Buying from share-
holder-growers in Australia is a later develop-
ment in the programme. The proposition is
very speculative, and on the data available
is not recommended as an investment where
safety is important. (See “‘Wild Cat
Monthly” for September, 1929.)
(1) If unable to keep up payments
( through unemployment) to Home Endow-
ment, Ltd., does membership expire? (2)
Gould money already paid in be recovered?

(1) No. (2 and 3) See Clause 33 of the
co.’s terms and conditions which consti-
tutes the contract between the co. and the
subscriber. (“Save as aforesaid [liquida-
tion] no subscriber shall... .in consequence
of the recission of his contract... .be en-
titled to obtain repayment of moneys.”)
It was the policy of the directors to make
refunds to subscribers who had fallen into
necessitous circumstances, on their supply-
ing the co. with satisfactory proof of their
position. But in view of the financial de-
pression and circumstances entirely beyond
the directors’ control, they decided in May
of this year that, in the interests of the
subscribers of the co. as a whole, they
could not continue making any refunds for
the present. This position will be reviewed
at a later date.

Gs. 4d 0. 'Bris: It does not follow that there’s
anything the matter with a co. because its shares
have fallen. A stock paying a 10 p.c. div. should
be worth at least a fifth less than it was a. year
ago owing to money being that much dearer.


Goldsbrough, Mort and Co. Ltd.
Pastoral Outlook Reviewed
Mr. J. M. Niall’s Interesting Survey of Present Conditions
The ordinary general meeting of shareholders of Goldsbrough, Mort and
Co., Ltd., was held at the head office of the company, Bourke Street,
Melbourne, to-day.
The secretary read the notice convening the meeting, the directors’ report
and statement of accounts were adopted, and the chairman (Mr. J. M.
Niall) addressed shareholders on the present economic condition in
Australia as it affected the pastoral and agricultural industries.
Mr. Niall’s address follows:
Gross income of the company on this
occasion was £795,752, as against £914,201 —
a reduction of £118,449 —while our expendi-
ture was £586,110, as compared with
£575,592 for the previous, 12 months,.
The greater part of .this increase is due
to payment on interest *to March 31, on
instalments 1 of’ new capital.
The falling .off in our profits is due
mainly to the drop in stock and wool values,
which has resulted, in reduced commission
earnings, reduced stock - and wool proceeds
from our own properties, and lower revenue
from our pastoral business, also to increased
drought expenditure such as hand feeding,-
agistment, droving and railages.
. It has.also- to be borne' in mind; that,
because of the" policy'of limiting offerings
during the season, a large proportion of the
wopl .that in normal circumstances- would
have beemsold during the financial year was
carried forward to the current year.. This
is evident from the number, of bales in our
stores unsold at March 31 1a5t—76,154,. as
compared'with 25,441 bales at a correspond-
ing date last year.
The proceeds for the. sale ■of - this large
quantity of ..-wool, had it, been realised
during the year under review, would have
considerably affected the items of advances
and sundry creditors and our profit and loss
account. >
SEASONAL CONDITIONS.
The rainfall during the, year under review
was much below the" average over the
greater part of New South Wales, South
Australian and northern Victoria. Condi-
tions were less severe in Queensland and
West Australia.
Since March 31 good falls have been ex-
perienced in the dry areas of New South
Wales, and the conditions in that State have
been greatly improved. Further rains, how-
ever, would be welcome, especially in the
Riverina and the western division. In
portions of these districts, although a
measure of relief has been secured, the
season cannot be regarded as satisfactory.
The rains came too late in many. cases to
ensure good lambing results, and cold
weather since has retarded the growth of
feed.
In Victoria, the Mallee and the Wimmera
need more rain for both stock and crops.
South Australia is still suffering severely
from drought. In many districts of that
State a normal rainfall has not been re-
corded for five or six years, and heavy
losses of. stock have been sustained.
West Australia, on the whole, was favored
with good climatic conditions during the
past year, but much of the purely pastoral
area is still in need of further rains.
WOOL VALUES.
The shortage of rain over a large area of
the Commonwealth resulted in a consider-
able proportion of the past season’s clip
being poorly grown, tender and dusty, which,
of course, adversely affected its value, and
partly accounts for the low prices obtained
for the clip.
As far as our own station properties are
concerned, dry conditions prevailed over
most of them during the year, necessitating
movements of stock, and a considerable ex-
penditure on fodder, but losses were not
much, if any, over normal.
During the past two months bountiful
rains have been recorded on all our pro-
perties, and the prospects are now good.
The harvest was greatly reduced in
volume, particularly in New South Wales,
Victoria and South Australia. I quote the
latest figures available . showing the heavy
falling off in wheat returns from all the
States, as compared with the previous year:
1928-1929.

The Federal
Government has
propounded a
scheme for a com-
pulsory wheat pool
for at least three
y e a r s,-with a
guarantee 'to the
farmers’ of 4s. a
bushel for next
season’s crop, de-
livered at any "rail-
way station.
' Should v the pool
be adopted; an ex-
pensive -. establish-
me'nt will be
created with' abso-
lute, control over
all ' the '' wheat
grown in Australia.
The effect , would
be to increase the
cost of, distribution,
and. put" the .con-
trol into the hands
of men who : may
not have the ne-
cessary knowledge '
to control wisely
the scheme. -
MR. J. M. NIALL,
Chairman of Directors Goldsbrough, Mart
and Co., Ltd.
In'any case, the Board will be quite
unable to obtain a better price for the ex-
portable surplus than world parity, which
can be obtained without Government con-
trol.
If it is proposed that the farmer shall be
paid 4s. a bushel in cash immediately his
wheat is delivered at the siding, it would
appear that the scheme is fundamentally
unsound, as the necessary finance would not
be available. The outlook for prices is
not encouraging, and, should it be found
necessary to sell the exportable surplus on a
market yielding less than the guaranteed
price, the deficiency would have to be met
by the taxpayer and local consumer.
THE WOOL MARKET.
At the opening sales of the season a
heavy fall of 20 to 25 per cent, was recorded
as compared with the closing sales of the
previous season. A slight improvement took
place before Christmas, but when the New
Year sales opened the market relapsed 25
to 30 per cent., and in the March sales
values were 35 to 40 per cent, below those
ruling 12 months earlier.
In April and May prices recovered to
some extent, but they are still about
to 10 per cent, below what they were at the
beginning of the season.
The average price a lb. realised, for the
period from July 1, 1929, to May 31, 1930,
for the whole of Australia, was 10.57 d. as
compared with 16.71 d. a lb. for the 12
months ended June 30, 1929—a decrease of
36.7 per cent.
At the most recent sales competition has
been firm, but there is nothing to suggest
that any material advance in prices maj"
be expected in the immediate future, and
in our opinion recovery will come only
when the trade depression, now being ex-
perienced throughout the world, passes
away.
PRIMARY PRODUCERS’ BURDEN.
For many years I have been pointing out
the disabilities that the primary producers
labor under, and I have consistently remon-
strated against the treatment meted out to
them. They have to bear unfettered com-
petition from other parts of the w'orld, and
are beai’ing burdens which are not imposed
on primary producers elsewhere, such as
excessive Customs tariffs, land tax, taxation
of a special character—for instance, workers’
compensation, child endowment—a high
scale of wages,
difficult conditions
of labor imposed
by the, Arbitration
Court, and, in the
case of wool and
fat stock, excessive
railway charges.
If the wool in-
dustry is to revive
all classes of wool-
growers throughout
the Commonwealth
require much more
considerate treat-
ment With the
exception of ' the
State of Victoria,
a 'largo proportion
of the - wool pro-
duced in Australia
is grown on lease-
hold land belong-
ing to the various
States; which there-
fore have a very
direct interest in
the welfare of the
woolgrowers who
are their tenants.
Will the Govern-
incuts consider what the position of Aus-
tralia. will be if the value of wool continues
on the basis of to-day with its present
burdens?
I append a table showing the relative
freight rates charged on the three principal
primary products. I have taken the middle
distance of 200 miles for the purpose of
comparison.
STOCK MARKETS.
Drought and the depressed wool prices
have adversely affected the market for stock
during the past year, a.nd the difficulty in
obtaining finance for the purchase of stock
has, no doubt, also had an adverse effect.
The cattle market has not suffered to the
same extent as that for sheep, but prices
for either fat or store cattle are not so good
as they were a few months ago.
The latest stock statistics in the various
States will, as customary, be annexed to
the printed copy of the report supplied to
shareholders.
I would again draw your attention to
the large amount of taxes payable annually
to the Federal and State Governments.
This amounts to approximately five per
cent, on our paid-up capital for the year
under review.
There will be further large deficits in the
Federal and State Budgets, and with the
acute trade depression from which we are
suffering, and the serious unemployment
problem to be dealt with, there is little
prospect of relief in sight; the indications
are all the other way.
FINANCE AND TRADE.
As already indicated, financial.and trade
conditions are extremely unsatisfactory.
Borrowing abroad (which, since the war,
has been somewhere in the region of
£30,000,000 a year) has now almost entirely
ceased, except for conversion purposes, and
as the cessation of loans means a substan-
tial reduction in imports, the revenue
derived by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment from Customs duties must decline.
This, and its action in raising certain
duties to undreamt-of heights, and abso-
lutely prohibiting the importation of numer-
ous articles. of merchandise, must further
augment' the' loss '1 of revenue from the
Customs, and is likely to cause serious
embarrassment at no distant date, from the
consequences of which taxpayers are likely
to , suffer, •. severely. ; Incomes, whether
derived‘from property or business, are be-
coming seriously diminished, with the result
that revenue.from.income tax will certainly
fall, thereby further depleting Government
revenue.
But there- is another more serious aspect.
The prosperity of this country in recent
years has been due, in considerable measure,
to high prices for its primary .products
(prices far in excess of those ruling before
the'wrap, but it is unlikely that these prices
will again be realised. The tendency seems
move towards a : return to pre-war levels.
The net result is that Australia to-day
faces a crisis, the disastrous consequences
of which can only be averted by drastic
public and private economy, and by largely
reduced costs of production in primary and
secondary industries.
ARBITRATION BILL.
I view most seriously the Government’s
proposed new Arbitration Bill, which
attempts to give absolute preference to
unionists, and which, if passed in its present
form, will place every industry in the Com-
monwealth in the hands of the unions. I
hope that a measure so repugnant to equity
and commonsense will not be passed.
Rather should the Government realise that
many industries at present cannot afford to
pay the full award rates, and that by sus-
pending the award and allowing the em-
ployer and employee to mutually agree
unemployment could be reduced in a very
material way.
The grant to the unemployed is justifiable
on humanitarian grounds, but the method
of its allocation, as proposed in certain
quarters, is open to severe criticism. To
give men more or less permanent employ-
ment at reduced rates is surely better than
to give temporary employment at full rates
to a few.
Special taxation is being raised to relieve
men who are out of work, and the wages
that are paid to relieve unemployment on a
large scale should be appreciably less than
the present basic wage.
NEW BANK BILL.
I have considerable misgivings in regard
to disturbing seriously the present banking
system at this juncture, and, although in
this I am at variance with authorities who
claim that a Central Reserve Bank is neces-
sary, the trading banks have done so well
for the community in the past, I would
suggest that, as an eminent financial autho-
rity, representative of the Bank of England,
is on the way to Australia, any action in
the direction of interference with our
present banking system should be deferred
until after conference with him.
A final distribution by the liquidators
of B.A.W.R.A. has yet to be made. This
is contingent on the outcome of certain
legal proceedings. It is hoped that a settle-
ment will shortly be arrived at, enabling a
distribution to shareholders, many of whom
urgently require payment.
The motion for the adoption of
the report and balance-sheet was
seconded by Mr. G. Powell, and
supported by Mr. L. Evans. A vote
of thanks to the directors and staff
was moved by Cr. Baron Marks.
Mr. G. Powell seconded it.
Messrs. S. J. and S. R. Warnock
were reappointed auditors.

jammer I. F. Chapman, bound for New-
castle to Honolulu. When near the Man-
gariva Group we sighted » vessel sailing to
intercept us. She hove to, and a boat, rowed
by two emaciated Kanakas and with a sick-
looking white man in the stern-sheets, put
off and came alongside
our hooker. The white
man was a French priest
and his croft was the
mission schooner La Crux
de Sud. The schooner’s
crew were all Kanakas,
including the skipper,
whose only instrument
was a “sextant” composed
of a half-cocoanut shell
with holes bored round
the rim. The skipper’s
method of navigating was
to sail due north or south
until his instrument
“showed him to be on the
required latitude; then
he would run down it
until he made a* landfall.”
If—as often happened—
it wasn’t the right island
he would ask the way
from the inhabitants anil
sail on. In this case the
cocoanut sextant had let
him down, and lie had
been hopelessly lost for
weeks. The crew lia*d used
up the last of their water
and were living solely on
bonita, albicore and other
deep-sea fish, and were
suffering horribly from
dysentery, as was to be
expected on such a diet.
Our skipper gave them
food and water and sail-
ing directions for their
destination Papeete
srnd we then braced up our mainyard and
sailed on. I never heard if they arrived
safely.

“M.H.” : The morning after the meeting of
the Poisoned Dog Progress Association I met
the treasurer. “Did they decide about the
pew sports ground last night, Bill?” I
inquired. "Yes,” he replied, “you orter been
there. It was funny. Old Dan (the presi-
dent) kept on calling it a resurrection
ground. The ignorant old cow don’t know the
difference between creation an’ resurrection.”
“Vil N.”:. Truthful James had the floor.
“Two of us,” he said, “had staggered under
the sweltering sun for days over the inter-
minable Centralian sand wastes. I can't,
remember in which direction we trailed, un-
fortunately ; but if I ever can, I will lead an
expedition to explore the ancient ruins we
stumbled upon. Because of the greasy baked-
clay walls, leering cockroaches and a faint
musty odor of fried fish, we concluded we
had discovered the remains of an ancient
Greek colony. Not a drop to drink, and we
were too weak to travel much further. On
the third morning, when giving up in despair,
we discovered a vessel’s prow jutting out of
a sand-drift. Feverishly unearthing it we
fouud a seaworthy flat-bottomed galley. We
were saved!” “How could a boat save you
in the middle of a desert?” someone asked.
“Easily,” replied James. “All we had to
do was to get in, wait till the blistering
noonday heat sot the earth perspiring freely,
and then float away!”
HARD ON THE BURGLAR.
PASSER-BY: “What’s the joke?”
THE HILARIOUS ONE: “Ha, ha! Look, there’s a burglar climbing through the window
of my house!”
PASSER-BY: “What’s the joke in that?”
THE HILARIOUS ONE: “Don’t you shee! The wife’ll shink it’sh me and he’ll get hell!”
“Carrick”; Addo, a well-known abo. in
N.Q. in pre-war days, was a stockman on
one of the Herbert River stations, and was
seen at his best on the occa-
sions of the Darktown races
(which were held on days fol-
lowing Ingham meetings), in a
paddock lent by Addo’s boss.
At those meetings Addo. was
the whole works —starter, judge,
handicapper and steward —and
he usually entered a prad or
two, too. On an occasion when
his horse was ridden by one of
his many sons it was borne
home to Addo that the steed
would not be able to win unless
something was done about it.
So seizing the finishing post he
rushed off up the track to meet
the horses, in a frenzied effort
to reach his own animal before
the challenger overtook it. He
ran swiftly, but was outpaced.
This minor technical difficulty,
however, was overcome by
Addo’s prompt disqualification
of the winning horse and its
rider for life, on the grounds
of a hastily trumped-up charge
of “in’erfer’nce,” which he
claimed to have observed as
steward, and reported to himself as judge.
But both horse and rider started in the next
event.

“G.P.D.”: A stranger, driving a two-horse
buggy, arrived late one afternoon at the hut
of old Dick Morrison, shepherd on the great
Bogan River run. He asked for a night’s
shelter, having lost his way. “You’ll find
it rough,” said Dick. “The company that
owns this run is the meanest lot of blighters
ever I worked for, and they don’t give a
man enough rations to live on, but I’ll do
me best for yer.” To the stranger’s
astonishment, roast lamb was on the bill of
fare that night. “My word,” quoth he appre-
ciatively, “this is good. Your company
doesn’t treat you so badly if it lets you have
the run of the lambs for tucker.” “My com-
pany,” said Dick bitterly, “don’t know
nothin’ about it, but a bloke has ter live,
an’ —mum’s the word !” Next morning when
the stranger was departing Dick said,
“Wliat’s yer name, Mister?” “Here’s my
card.” Dick read it: “J. W. Jones, Chief
Inspector, Bogan River Pastoral Co.” “All
right,” groaned Dick, “I’m sacked. Yel
needn’t rub it in.” Jones winked. “Mum’.'i
the word,” he chuckled. “We’re not that
mean!”

“It. McK.”: Re “E.H.S.’s” version (B-
-18/6/’3O) of the attempt to take a waggon
down Peacock’s Spur on the King River.
Henry Peacock wasn’t the hero. The waggon
was owned and driven by Donald McMillan, a
selector living at Cheshunt. lie and his son
Jack had been fencing for a man named
McCormick, and being in a hurry to get
home they decided to come down the Pea-
cock Spur. At the top of the Spur they
fixed a drag to the waggon, but it would
not hold, and the vehicle rushed violently
down till it struck a tree. The horses were
freed by the shafts breaking. This hap-
pened in 1888, and the waggon was burned
in the bush fires of 1894. Jack McMillan
now has a farm at Eltham, near Melbourne.

“Aragun”: Choom wanted a pass to
Deniliquin and he applied to the sergeant
for it. “Ye’ll starve to death out there,”
advised Ryan; “try somewhere else.” But
Cuthbert insisted on Deniliquin. “Dammit,
man, the niggers’ll eat yer,” growled the law.
Cuthbert’s resolve to proceed to Deniliquin,
however, was unshakable. “All right,”
murmured Ryan resignedly taking up his
pen “D-e-n-i,” he spelled aloud and baulked*
“D-e-n-i” again; then: “Ye contrary divil,”
he roared in exasperation, and scribbled
rapidly “ye’ll go to D-o-o-b-o —Doobbo.”

“Tagen”; On Kangaroo Plain, 10 miles
south of Narrandera (N.S.W.), are num-
erous circular tracks, one to two chains in
diameter. These are worn down below the
level of surrounding land, and the excavated
earth has been thrown towards the centre.
They are very similar to circus rings, but
there’s, a local theory that they were made
by the abos. and used for corroborees. If
so, Binghi must have known how to draft
a true circle.

who had climbed up to finish off a group of
figures. He left the intruder there, but
next day one of the officials from Brisbane’s
Botanic Gardens-ctm-Zoo ascended on the
boa with a bag. The creature, which had
taken no notice of the sculptor working
alongside him the previous day, objected
bitterly to being run in, and fastened his
teeth in his captor’s arm. How Eve’s old
friend got so high in Brisbane society, and
whence he came, only the father of all ser-
pents knows.
PROFOUND THOUGHT.
“Why so worried , Professor?”
“I was just wondering what will happen when Sydney and Melbourne grow so big
that they meet. Will that city then be called Sydney or Melbourne?”
“Arev”: Young Bill Jupp came home in
triumph. Someone had given him a young
cattle-dog. Bill dragged the pup on a
length of chain that tautened or clanked
as the animal capered or
dawdled. “Ain’t we got enough
dogs?” growled Dad. “It's a
prize cattle-pup,” stammered
Bill as he turned to keep pace
with the evolutions of the
hound. “It’s a prize fool,” said
Dad. Bill took the pup to the
tall pine beside the house. As
Dad watched the proceedings,
the big drake waddled up to
make observations. The pup
made a spring that tore the
chain out of Bill's hands. The
drake fluttered aside just in
time to escape. Dad gave a
yell that would have startled a
much older dog. He wore on
his watch-chain the medal that
the bird had won at the Show
the previous year. That drake
was the apple of his eye, and
rumbling with wrath he assisted
Bill to chain the pup very
securely to the pine-tree. That
night the silence was broken by
heart-rending howls. The pup
wanted to go home. Dad stood
it until his patience gave way.
Then he got out of bed, grabbed
the first missile he could find
and aimed it in the direction of
the uproar. After that there
was silence. Dad went back to
bed and pondered. At first
there was satisfaction that his
aim had been effective. After
a while he began to be anxious.
Suppose he had killed the pup!
Bill would be upset in the
morning if his pup were dead.
Dad would gladly have heard
another howl. No howl came,
however. After a restless night
Dad rose early, but Bill w r as
before him. Dad could see the
lad bending down near the pine-
tree. Bill looked up as his
father approached. “The dog
has broken the chain and got
away,” he called, “And some-
one has chucked the boot-last
at the big drake and killed
him.”
“B.B.”: Most native creatures kept a*s
pets have a tendency to go bush, however
well treated, but a tame ’possum cannot be
kicked out of the home he has been reared
in. No matter how often he is evicted, and
how far out he is deposited in the bush, the
little chap sooner or later will come scamper-
log home, bubbling over with delight on
finding himself back in his old quarters again.
If the unwanted pets are turned adrift under
circumstances which' make it impossible for
them to find their way back home again,
they’ll take up their abode in some outhouse
attached to another dwelling. Later on,
when they get to know the run of the place,
they’ll invade the kitchen.
“Alex”: Lake Joclmus, beyond Aramac
(W.Q.), which has an area of 60 sq. miles,
contains both salt and fresh water in two
distinct divisions. The south end of the
lake is salt and the north end fresh.
Varieties of fish of both salt and fresh water
species abound and keep strictly to their
respective waters.
“M.L.C.” : Probably, as “Bad Australian”
remarks (B. 11/6/’3O), Tasmania was con-
nected with the mainland within what
geologists would call comparatively recent
times, though the break occurred sufficiently
long ago to allow of
the development of
different types of na-
tives. But it is pos-
sible to argue, on the
same class of evidence,
that the Speck was
once connected with
the southern portion
of S. America. For
instance, the island’s
only deciduous tree,
Fay us gunnii, is also
native to Patagonia,
and is found nowhere
else in the world. But
tha*t isn't conclusive
proof of anything.
Maria Island, on the
Speck’s east coast, has
wallabies but no possums, and Selionten
Island, in the same region, has ’possums
but no wallabies.

“Billy Bush’”: What “Scran” (B.
4/6/’3O) took to be lice waltzing on the
carcase of a young tiger-snake just
slaughtered were probably what bushworkers
know as “scrub-itch,” a parasite that infests
both marsupials and reptiles in Bananaland.
The insects, which are reddish in color, set
up an intolerable itch on any skin to which
they fasten themselves, and scratching in-
creases the torment. The pests don’t care.
whether their host is dead or alive. A
seven-foot brown snake brought to me the
other day for identification was crawling
with them, though it had been dead for more
than an hour before it reached me.

“Exdig”: The only man I know who never
suffered from cold feet was a N.S.W. bush-
man in the A.I.F. named Wall, who had
never worn socks and resisted all efforts
made to induce him to vary the habit. At
a time when conditions in France were
causing so many cases of trench feet that
foot inspections were constant, a new
platoon officer was shocked to discover Wall's
sockless condition; but Wall offered to bet
the officer that he was the only one in the
crowd with decently warm feet—and the
nip artist proved that he was right. If the
sockless one had gone down with trench
feet he could have been charged with S.I.W.
7 self-inflicted wounds; but his confidence
in his partial bare-footedness was well
founded. But he was a whale for boots-
flic heavier they were the better he liked
them.

“Avon”: Hawaii has no crow over Maori-
land in the matter of folk music. It is close
on 40 years since I first heard a Maori sing a
tribal song—it was at Raupakipa, near Lyttel-
ton—but the memory survives more vividly
than most other musical experiences. Unless
Alfred Hill took some notes in a shorthand
of his own invention during his sojourn in
the land of the fern, I don’t think there
has been any attempt to put the Maori
music on paper. The Maoris, though advanced
in other forms of culture, were unlettered.
The tunes and words were handed down
from generation to generation, and the names
of composers and librettists, save in a few
celebrated instances, have been forgotten by
a . race that despised all save the military
virtues. The other day I listened to a set
of gramophone records of Maori singers,
made at Rotorua, that included some of the
traditional melodies, and they reminded me
of the fact that the Maoris evolved at least
three unique rhythms; which in vitality are
on a par with the gypsy lilts immortalised by
Liszt and Brahms. There’s a magnificent
new field waiting a composer who cares to
study Polynesian music and apply the result
of his researches to the sonata and the
symphony.

“Pick”; In pools shaded by high river
banks, or in deep water under the wooded
bluffs that bound the lakes, lurks the hermit
trout —the most voracious cannibal of the
fresh-water kingdom. An outcast from liis
finny tribe, the lone fish changes his habits
and even his appearance. His jaws become
larger than usual, some of his teeth grow
to protruding tusks, his body becomes
angular and attenuated, and his aspect for-
bidding and hostile. From his dark nooks
lie sallies by day to attack the trout fry
schooling in the sunlight of the shallows,
and having devoured them he retires to his
lair. But it is by night that he customarily
carries out his forays. Then he wars upon
all fish and his devastation is great. Flies
or worms do not tempt him, so he is difficult
to catch, but the enraged fisherman some-
times vents him out with a dynamite charge

to his job of town-crying, aided by a beauti-

gains!” has been a by-phrase of Ballarat

It must have driven to despair, and many

A reg’lar hog for eatin’ steam and chewin’

It’s cure or kill, and you’re seldom still,
You must go with a will on a ten-head.
A dog-legged sort of glory-hole upended on
a reef,
A winch, a brace, a windin’ pole and ten
per cent, of grief,
Some stopin’, mostly underhand, that’s done
along the line,
Which makes (if you can understand) what’s
counted as a mine.
It’s scratchin’ for ore on a ten-head, makes
a man sore on a ten-head;
I’ve done it before, and I’ll do it no more
(But I’ve said that before) on a ten-head.
She’s ill equipped and second-hand, just odds
and ends and string;
The launders chokin’ up with sand —and
hear the stampers ring.
The feeders hangin’ up the muck because
of want of fall,
And mine was just the sort of luck to come
and catch it all.
It always was so on a ten-head, catchin’
what-ho on a ten-head;
It’s thunder below, and, by crikey you’ll go—
You’ll go all you know on a ten-head.

PASTURE IMPROVEMENT.
“Wrye”: This subject was discussed by
the Agricultural section of the recent
Science Congress in Brisbane. A summary
of the useful information forthcoming is
here attempted.
Grasslands are being classified on the type
of herbage they naturally produce, and in
each class four methods of improvement are
being simultaneously experimented with.
These are: (1) Introduction of improved
species of grass; (2) introduction of
improved strains of the grasses already
present; (8) better methods of manage-
ment; (4) use of fertilisers. The possi-
bilities of grassland development in south-
eastern Australia along these lines were
systematically dealt with.
In regions of 30-inch uniform rainfall and
in irrigation areas the sowing down of
perennial rye grass—-white clover pastures is
a business proposition where combined with
applications of superphosphate and practise
of intensive grazing. This is regarded as
the climax type of pasture for such districts,
though the value of paspalum is not dis-
counted where the best pasture-management
methods are practised.
The next zone to be considered is that
receiving 20in. to 30in of winter rainfall.
In these areas there is a four-months’ dry
period, during which the stock must be
carried on the natural hay produced during
the flush of spring growth. Any introduced
grasses must therefore be of ah improved
annual type, giving satisfactory green feed
during the spring and a palatable and nutri-
tive hay for summer and autumn feeding.
There are two species especially recommended
for such areas—Wimmera rye grass and
subterranean clover.
Another possibility is the top-dressing of
natural pastures. Payable results may be
expected under a 20-inch rainfall w r h'erever
super, is required by cereal crops. The
chief effect of top-dressing is the encourage-
ment of annual grasses and clovers. With-
out a representation of these species in the
pasture, a payable response is rarely
obtained. There is no evidence to show that
wmllaby grass, the native perennial common
to these areas, has anywhere given a payable
response to top-dressing.
In the 35in. to 20in. rainfall zone, top-
dressing and subterranean clover are both
possibilities in the more favored area*s, and
should go hand in hand. Generally, how-
ever, improvements lie in the more efficient
management of the natural pastures, which
consist largely of wallaby grass in the pas-
toral districts, and of the annuals ba*rley
grass and burr clover on land which has been
temporarily left out of cultivation in the
agricultural districts.
SILAGE POINTS.
“Trepex’Silage is one of the best sub-
stitutes which can be found for green grass.
A few points which should be remembered
when laying down the store.
(1) Do not let the intended crop become
over-ripe or dry. Food value diminishes in
a wilting crop.
(2) Do not cut the crop when it is too
succulent. The juices have not become
proper organic food. a?nd may be squeezed
out in the process of pressing. Give them
time to become fixed in leaf and stem.
(3) Over-succulency is better than over-
dryness.
(4) Exclusion of air is essential, and so
is good packing, whether in pit or in silo.
(5) When filling in, distribute the heavy
and the light stuff so that they will bind
together evenly and without any air suction.
Leaf and stalk will also then be in better
proportion when the silage is to be helped
out to the stock.
(6) Press the material in evenly and con-
tinuously, not overdoing the pressing at the
edges.
(7) The best time to put out the silage
is toward evening, so that the sun will not
dry it out before the stock can get at it.
It should be well spread out over clean
ground.
A WELL-RECOMMENDED DIP.
From William D. McCallum: —
“Trepex” (B„ 11/6/’3O) has been unfortunate in
his choice of designs of sheep dips. After 40 years’:
experience of all kinds, I am satisfied that there is
none to compare with the “walk in, walk out” dip.
Properly constructed, it is the easiest and safest to
work for man and beast.
I have dipped ewes within a month of lambing
without any casualties; in fact, I have dipped many
thousands of sheep in one and have never lost a
sheep. Once started they walk in, swim through

TRAINING THE SHEEP-DOG.
“Kelpie”: In selecting a pup make sure
that the strain he is bred from has pro-
duced natural and consistent workers, and
that he is lively and vigorous. He should
have a keen eye and he broad between the
ears, with a deep broad chest.
Complete control is the foundation on
which his career will depend. He must be
taught to act immediately the command is
given—taught to come when called, to
"come behind” and to “sit down.” All this
not by bullying him or dulling his finer
senses by too much repetition, but by clear
instructions. Encourage him as he begins
to learn, and maintain harmony by striving
to understand his ways and by exercising
patience and self-control. Avoid tiring him by
trying to teach him too much at once; be
will learn little when tired.
His first few lessons with sheep should be
imparted in company with a broken-in dog.
By imitation he will soon pick up the mean-
ing of a command given to the experienced
fellow. In the initial stages he is sure to
make mistakes. Overlook these if they are not
bad, for to. be unduly checked at this stage of
his education will not only confuse him, but.
may even prevent him from working at all for
some months if he is of a shy nature. Eater
on, when lie becomes more sure of himself, it
will be necessary to correct mistakes for fea<r
they become fixed habits; but remember it
must be very bewildering to him at first.
At four months a pup can be given his
grounding in control. At six months he is
sufficiently mature for short lessons with
sheep, although he cannot be expected to
work hard or travel long distances. Biting
sheep should, of course, be checked immedi-
ately. Given a good foundation, the dog’s
usefulness will turn on his teacher’s ability
a*nd perseverance. In a large measure he, will
reflect vour own character.
WESTRALIAN WHEAT YIELDS.
“Tuart”: Full returns of the Westralian
wheat harvest show that 3,568,225 acres
yielded 39,081,183 bushels, an average of 11
bushels, whereas in 1928-29, 33,790,040
bushels were stripped from 3,343,530 acres,
the average being 10.1 bushels. In the last
pre-war year production amounted to
13,331,350 bushels averaging 12.15 bushels.
Before the war Westralia was a long way
behind South Australia as a wheatgrower;
now it is well ahead of that State, making-
all allowance for the fact that Nature has
not been kind to South Aus. the last three
years.
A friendly rivalry exists between the
eastern and western parts of the Westralian
wheat belt. The westerners won last season;
they got their normal rainfall or better,
whereas the easterners had less than normal.
Carnamah, on the Midlands railway, pro-
duced 1,833,269 bushels averaging 14.3
bushels; Three Springs (452.753 bushels)
also had a 14.3 average; Mingenew (674,813
bushels) averaged 14.8; and though the Dal-
wallinu average fell to 11.3 the output from
that district reached 1,874,864 bushels.
Among the eastern districts Wyalkatchem
(1,216,724 bushels, averaging 11.8), Dowerin
(1,183,182, averaging 11.7), and Koorda
(879,327, averaging 11) did well. Further
east still the scantier rainfall told visibly on
the returns. In Mt. Marshall (1,117,209),
Nungarin (915,577) and Westonia (542,038)
the average dropped below 8 bushels; in
Yilgarn (856,785) it declined to 5.8 bushels.
It is in Yilgarn that many of the 3500
farms are to be surveyed, if all goes well with
that scheme. It had the best State average
two years ago, but it is obviously a region
in which scratched-in crops will pay only
in exceptional years.
The south-western division claims the dis-
trict with the highest aggregate (Bruce Rock,
1,727,553 bushels) and the one with the
best average. In Gnowangerup, 30,148 acres
were sown for a yield of 598,833 bushels
averaging 19.9 bushels. Gnowangerup actu-
ally got 5 bushels more to the acre than
the district next on the list. Yet the land
is no better than in a score of other places,
nor was Gnowangerup specially favored with
moisture last year. It is noteworthy that
individual areas sown in that district were
small compared with those cropped in other
parts of the wheat belt; and obviously they
were farmed efficiently. Very likely thorough
farming methods are the secret of Gnowan-
gerup’s success. And very likely what has
been done in this district could be done
throughout the wheat belt. Certainly a
general 20-bushel average would make a great
difference to Westralia’s production and to
its future; and it is eminently worth striving
for.
THRIFT ON THE FARM.
‘‘Bar Iv”: One reason why farmers of
German extraction are very successful in
Australia is that they are thrifty. Thrift
is immensely important. Time and again I
have seen ca<:es in which a young man with
capital which Dad earned for him equipped
his farm with all the latest appliances, ex-
pensive buildings, and (of course) an
expensive motor-car —and failed spectacu-
larly. He has been beaten out of sight by
a* thrifty fellow who selected a bit of bush
land, cleared a few acres by his own labor,
cropped it, and went on effecting improve-
ments a bit at a time.
The need for thrift applies not only to
the farmer, but to the farm itself. Land
must not be wasted, it must be worked and
kept worked on the most economical lines
combined with efficiency. If money is spent
on seed and manure, it is necessary that the
cultivation of the land be thorough and
that the soil be in the best possible condition
to receive the crop. And unceasing attention
must be paid to the crop during its lifetime.
A few good horses are more economical to
keep than a lot of chea*p crocks. And the
difference in cost between a gaudy and a
modest car will buy a lot of seed, or fer-
tiliser, or even fodder in a dry time.
WINTER CAMPAIGN AGAINST
RABBITS.
What is the best method of destroying
rabbits during the winter and spring?
“Fumigating them in the burrows,” says
Chief-Inspector Craig, of Westralia, “with
carbon bisulphide, a liquid, or calcium
cyanide, obtainable in either dust or flake
form. Machines for using carbon bisulphide
are to be got in Perth from £2 10s. upwards,
and for distributing calcium cyanide dust
a*t £5 10s. upwards; they effect a great
saving of material.” Where there are rabbits
but no burrows, Mr. Craig recommends
settlers “to keep on with poison baits.”
It is a great mistake, he insists, to suspend
the war against rabbits when green feed
and water ace plentiful. Settlers who do
this “allow the rabbits to breed up again,
thereby undoing all the good work done
during the summer.”
DO PIGS PAY?
“Thorley”: On dairy farms where skim-
milk is a waste product, pigs give good
returns. As a rule, a value of 2d. per gallon
is allowed for skim-milk fed to pigs. To get
the best returns, however, other more con-
centrated foods should be used ; and will it
pay?
Tests bearing on this very important point
have been conducted by the Vic. Agricultural
Department of Boolara. There it was found
that pigs on short pasture gave better results
than when running on pasture (cow grass
and lucerne) two feet high, the daily gain
being 1.401 b. against 1.121 b. Eight Tam-
worth-Berkshires farrowed on March 26,
and averaging 28.11 b. when 73 days old,
were fed in a pasture paddock, and in 52 days
averaged 90.61 b. They dressed 66 per cent,
and at B|d. per pound returned £l7 11s.
Pollard cost £6 6s. 2d., barley 10s. 6d. a*nd
skim-milk (at 2d. per gal.) £2 3s. 6d., leav-
ing a profit of £8 10s. 10d., or £1 Is. 4d. each.
But at 73 days old those pigs could not have
been bought under 10s. and might have cost
255., so that the profit was trifling, apart
from the skim-milk receipts and the manure
—a decided factor, particularly where the
pigs are paddock-fed.
Six Large York.-Tamwort:h's farrowed on
March 31 averaged 55.81 b. at 67 days.
Paddock-fed, a self-feeder being used, they
consumed in 67 days 204 gals, of skim-milk
(£1 145.), 51b. maize (5d.), 9|lb. Meggitt’s
meal (Is. 7d.), 2801 b. ground barley (£1
l's.), 3071 b. ground wheat (£1 Bs. Id.) and
9291 b. pollard (£3 13s. 5d.). They dressed
6S per cent, and sold for BJd. per pound
(£26 2s. Id.), showing a profit of £lB 3s. 7d.
Deducting initial cost, they showed a sub-
stantial gain.
Nine Large York, ex Berkshire-Middle York
pigs farrowed on August 14, and averaging
39.441 b. at 61 days, went up to 186.71 b. in
112 da-ys, and dressed 69 per cent. Food
costs were reckoned at £3O 13s. 2d., and
apparent profit at £6 Is. 2d., but nothing was
allowed for purchase in the first place.
It looks as if the way to make money in
pig-farming is to convert waste products like
skim-milk and use home-grown pastures,
grains and fodder crops, allowing the
animals, as far as possible, to do the har-
vesting.
USES FOR OLD TOOLS.
“Booraby”: Old planting hoes and stirrup-
irons are always worth keeping. The hoe,
with the eye widened a bit —a job easily
done when the iron is heated —makes a
good top hinge for a gate. It is spiked to
tne top of the post through a couple of holes
punched in the blade; and the bottom of
the gate rests in a wooden block. The
stirrup-iron makes a handy fastener. It is
secured to the post with a couple of strong-
nails, through the eye, the nails being bent
back so that the iron slips easily over the
gate-head. This swings more freely than
twisted wire and never gets out of shape.
An old saw-blade makes many things—
butcher’s knives, bread knives, meat-choppers.
Two pieces of flat wood, an inch to an inch
and a half wide, riveted on, are all that is
necessary for a handle,
The steel ribs from an old pair of corsets
—if corsets are worn nowadays—are useful
for repairing door locks. Usually the first
part of a lock that breaks is the spring.
Most people then throw the lock away,
though it is very easily repaired. Unscrew
the two halves and take out the broken
spring. Then cut a similar length from a
steel rib, and bend it to the required shape.
It has only to be dropped into place; it
isn’t fastened in any way. This spring
answers just as well as the original.
Old bullock bows are convenient for re-
placing lost and broken tines in the har-
row- —or for making one; and the links of a
broken hobble chain make rings for leg-
ropes and other things. The top part of a
broken spade- or garden-fork handle makes
the best dibble for putting out plants ; while
the fork that has got a prong or two broken
can be transformed into a pronged hoe by
levelling the “teeth” and bending the handle
part at the neck.
OPEN DAMS.
“Lucerne Flea”: I agree with “Bunny”
(B. 11/6/’3O) that the mud-pond contain-
ing a high percentage of stock urine and
dung, to say nothing of the gravy from a
bogged sheep, is a curse, whereas a dam of
sweet water is an asset to any place. And
water can be kept sweet.
Every dam at which livestock drink should
be completely enclosed with a fence of
rabbit-netting, and provided with, a silt-
catcher to strain out rubbish. The catch-
ment area should also be looked after and a
few dozen ordinary mud-carp liberated in the
dam. These fish are the best means of keep-
ing leeches and yabbies out of the water.
To get the dam water to the stock troughs
I favor a pipe siphon, ending in a short
length of rubber-hose fastened to the under-
side of a float made out of a big lump of
well-tarred Oregon. This ensures that only
clean surface water goes to the troughs,
whether the surface of the dam is high or
low. The wooden float slides up and down
on a length of inch pipe driven vertically
into the bottom of the dam, thus preventing
the hose from pinching and shutting off the
supply to the troughs.
MANURE-FOULED PADDOCKS.
“Bark”: Much of the grazing value of
dairying land is lost if manure is allowed to
lie about the pastures, and further loss is
caused by the wormy condition of stock fed
on such pastures—horses are endangered
more than cows.
The most valuable use for this manure is,
of course, to fertilise a cultivated crop. This
means work in collecting and carting it to
the cultivation, but the labor will be repaid
by the moisture conserved and the enriched
crop. If it is not feasible to rake up the
manure, the pasture should be harrowed
over when the ground is moist, preferably
with discs, so that soil and vegetation may
absorb the fertiliser to tlie best advantage.
When rain has fallen on a pasture so
treated the performance should be repeated.
The result will' be a sweet and more vigor-
ous growth which the stock will enjoy.
A SUGAR-CANE DISEASE.
“Phytopath”: “Hortus” (B. 11/6/’3O) is
incorrect in advocating crop rotation to solve
the problem presented by the gumming disease
in sugar-cane. Provided reasonable field sani-
tation is practised, crop rotation is, generally
speaking, efficacious only in the control of
root diseases, such’ as wilt of tomatoes a<nd
take-all of wheat —both caused by fungi
which persist in the soil and gain entry
through the roots of the host plant.
Gumming disease is caused by a. bacterium
( B , vascularum) which can gain entry in
two ways: (1) By the use of infected cane
knives, and (2) through fresh scratches in
the leaves during wet, windy weather.
Attempts to transmit the disease through the
soil have been carried out by officials of the
C.S.R. Co. and the Bureau of Sugar Experi-
ment Stations, but have failed in every case.
Even cuttings planted in the crown of roots
of stools which had died from gumming
disea*se remained healthy. The only avail-
able methods of control are the planting of
healthy plants cut with a sterile knife and

r. is an established engineering
principle that lower engine revolu-
tions mean a longer-lived car. The
Pontiac Six has lower engine revolu-
tions per mile of road travelled-
regardless of speed—than any other
car of its price. Estimated conserva-
tively, this means three million less
revolutions each year of ordinary
service. Think of the wear saved !
Shorter piston strokes save wear,
too. Pontiac’s pistons travel 222 feet
less per mile than the average for all
cars of its class. This smooth-
running power flow means less strain,
less wear, less vibration—greater
comfort, longer life, lower upkeep.
Pontiac is also slightly heavier-
stronger enough throughout to assure
longer wear and greater safety,
wherever extra strength is needed.

the use of resistant varieties. None of the
four major cane diseases of Queensland —
gumming, leaf-scald, mosaic and Fiji disease
—spread through' the soil.
The assertion that sugar-cane is a large
feeder and consequently exudes more poison-
ous matter, thereby becoming “diseased in
itself,” can be refuted by reference to the
experience of Hawaii. In that country, the
home of high sugar-per-acre production, the
yields are increasing every year and yet con-
tinuous cropping is practised. Many of the
heaviest-yielding fields have not been out of
cane for a period of a month during the past
BO years.
COOL STORAGE OF FRUIT.
“Disc Harrow”: Too often fruit exported
overseas arrives in bad condition. With a
view of discovering a remedy experiments
of great interest to growers have been carried
out at the Victoria Docks, Melbourne. Final
results show that pears and peaches should
be harvested before any trace of yellow
appears in the ground color, and imme-
diately placed in the cooling chamber. Owing
to the danger of bitter pit, apples should
be allowed to ripen a little further. In
all cases pre-cooling before shipping seems
one of the factors of success.
Different batches of William pears, the
most perishable of all varieties, were held
for six weeks in separate chambers where
the temperatures were 31, 34, 37, 40 and 43
degrees Falir. respectively. The two lowest
temperatures were found most satisfactory.
Fruit kept at 40 degrees for two weeks and
afterwards lowered to 31 degrees was fully
colored when taken out, and though quite
sound would have needed immediate market-
ing. That kept throughout at 31 degrees
was as firm as when picked, and could be
stored in the open for several days before
sale.
Peaches reacted similarly, those stored at
31 and 34 degrees being in perfect condition
and the remainder proving more or less
decomposed until at 43 degrees they were
rotten. Grand Duke plums showed no dif-
ference in appearance, but the lower tem-
perature ones proved superior in flavor.
Fruit should not be stored when wet,
which increases the danger of scald. For
overseas marketing waterproof wrappings
are desirable, as in the event of one apple
rotting it is insulated from the remainder.
Given these conditions and adequate cool-
ing, there is no reason why Australian
fruit should not be carried round the world,
if necessary.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Has the N.S.W. Dept, of Agriculture con-
ducted tests toith electrified seed? If so,
what was'the result? —7170.
Yes, at Grafton experiment farm and
Hawkesbury Ag. Col. Three varieties of
maize were used, and a portion of each was
electrically treated by A. G. Bennett. All
the plots had similar treatment with regard
to cultivation, date of sowing, rate of seed-
ing, etc. In every instance the seed that
had "been electrified failed to give any in-
crease in yield over the untreated seed. Tests
with vegetable seeds were carried out at
Hawkesbury Ag. Col., following the instruc-
tions in Mr. Bennett’s book on electrocul-
ture. In these trials check plots were
planted with similar seed untreated. Only
one lot of electrically treated seed
gave better germination than the un-
treated, and that was in the case of par-
snips, which gave 77 p.c. germination against
75 p.c. from the untreated. In all other
cases the germination from the electrified
seed was below that of the untreated, and
in the case of peas and beans there was a
distinct harmful effect from electrical treat-
ment. Yields on the electrified-seed areas
did not disclose any increase, and in the
case of cucumbers the plants were noticeably
weaker than those from untreated seed, and
produced less than half the number of fruits
obtained from the untreated plot. Disease
was just as prevalent on the treated plots
as on the untreated.
(1) Is the tung-oil tree grown in Aus-
tralia and Maoriland? (2) In what dis-
tricts does it grow best? (3) Where can
seeds be obtained? —7363.
(1) Yes, but culture of it is still in the
experimental stage. (2) The trees have done
fairly well at Innisfail and Brisbane (Q.),
Sydney, and in the Tauranga district of
M.L. (3) Commercially, from B. F. Wil-
liamson, Gainesville, Fla.; American Tung
Oil Corporation, 2201 New York-avenue,
Washington, D.C. ; or Otto Katzenstein and
Co., Atlanta Ga. —all of U.S.A. The
Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Ivew,
England, will supply seed for experimental
propagation.
My cow has a lump on her ribs just behind
the knee joint of one of her front legs and
about the size of g>n egg. It has been there
seven months. A week ago it enlarged very
much, but ivas not sore. She calved two
days ago, gives plenty of milk and seems
otherwise healthy. Will it be safe to use the
milk, and what treatment is necessary? —
7242.
Probably the lump is a tumor of the “cold
abscess” type. Providing it does not fluc-
tuate nor cause pain there is no immediate
need for treatment, and the milk may safely
be used. Should the tumor enlarge or become
painful get the advice of a vet. or stock
inspector.
How should nitrate of soda be used as a
fertiliser for vegetables, orange-trees and
flowers (especially daphne)? —6B94.
It is unsuited to da*phne and should be
used sparingly on other kinds of flowering
plants, and only then when the plants need
extra food, as in the case of carnations just
coming into flower or chrysanthemums
which have just formed their buds. Nitrate
of soda is approximately 15 per cent, nitro-
gen, and for an orange-tree up to about
8 years old lib. of nitrate should be
ample, and from 8 to 15 years 21b. nitrogen
might be applied. It is advisable to use some
organic matter in addition. Obtain leaflet,
“Maintaining Fertility in the Vegetable Gar-
den,” from Dept, of Agriculture, Sydney.
Ts there any record of parasites attacking
the codlin-moth in N.S.W. If so, has the
Dept, of Agriculture conducted any experi-
ments with these parasites and with what
result? —74o6.
A supply of a parasite of the moth eggs,
Trichogramma minutum, has been obtained
from California and liberated in several
N.S.W. orchard districts. In addition
arrangements have been made with the Im-
perial Bureau of Entomology, London, for
the supply of other parasites. None of the
parasites tried in N.S.W. has proved an
efficient control.
(1) How much land must I hold in N.S.W.
before I can claim a “living area ” grazing
property? (2) Must my own land be free-
hold? (3) Can I claim a make-up if the
country thrown open for selection is several
miles away from the block which I hold? —
7331.
(1) The rule is that the combined area
of original and additional holdings must not
exceed an area which, in the opinion of
the local Land Board, is sufficient to main-
tain a home under average conditions. (2)
In some cases the holder of a freehold block
of 40 acres or more may apply for an addi-
tional conditional purchase or conditional
lease in virtue of such freehold, in the same
way as the holder of an original holding (3)
The matter is decided by the Land Board,
which must determine whether the land is or
is not within a “reasonable working distance”
of the original holding.
My sheep-dog, five years old, has been
suffering from mattery, scabby eyes for a
year, but is otherwise in good health. What’s
the cure? —7382.
Bathe the eyes with a warm solution of
Epsom salts and water (one teaspoonful to
one half-pint). Then with an eye-dropper
instil into each eye a few drops of a lotion
consisting of zinc, 12gr.; laudanum, 1
drachm; distilled water, 3oz. Continue this
treatment daily.
A disease has broken out in my poultry -
yard, The faces of the hens become scabby
and the eyes become blind and suppurate.
Cause and cure? —7240.
They are suffering from roup, which could
be caused by overcrowding or badly venti-
lated or damp and draughty condition in the
house. The affected eyes should be bathed
and the nostrils syringed out with a strong
solution of permanganate of potash, and
this treatment should be followed by inject-
ing a few drops of a mixture consisting of
eucalyptus oil 15 drops, oil of thyme 15
drops, menthol crystals sgr. and paraffin
oil loz.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Mick” : When feeding ewes in lamb that
are in good condition, take care they get the
exercise so necessary to keep them fit. Deaths
from twin disease are always more frequent
when sheep are fed close to the waterhole
and don’t have to travel in search of tucker.
“Trepex”: Lambs intended for sale as
suckers should not be shorn. The deteriora-
tion in flesh through bruising and handling
more than counter-balances any little gain
which would come from the sale of the
immature fleece. Neither does the little
beggar look so well for market in his shorn
condition.
“Bar K.”: A great hindrance to the pig-
raising industry is the man who keeps his
pigs in confined spaces. Swine fever, which
is simply a form of hog cholera, nearly
always gets it start in an insanitary sty or
yard. Give the pigs fresh air, fresh water
and fresh pasture, and your herd will be
healthier, and more prolific; also it will make
better quality pork and bacon.
“Sungrowth”: “Armidale” (B. 18/6/’3O),
who advises North Coast (N.S.W.) farmers
to rejuvenate their worn-out paspalum pad-
docks with the a<id of a disc plough, is not
abreast of the times; the best method is to
use the stiff-tine cultivator. The points of
this implement penetrate the paspalum to a-
depth of four inches, breaking up the matted
root mass and promoting a fresh growth of
succulent grass; the disc plough does not
break up the root mass properly, portion, of
the pasture being thus thrown out of action
for a time. Farmers on the Macleay are
using the stiff-tine paspalum renovator with
great success.
“Bill R.”: When the plough is not in use
keep mouldboard and share thickly greased
with oil or petroleum jelly. Then rust-pitted
parts will not drag the soil, increase the
labor or prevent a clean furrow finish.
“XSA”: Deciduous trees may now be
planted out in N. S. .Wales —the earlier the
better. Root development is active long
before the leaves commence to appear.
Examine roots carefully, removing those
damaged and watching for gall growths.
Plant the same depth as when in the nursery.
“L. Poole”: My cabbages were attacked by
aphis, but my lettuces were immune. I
boiled some lettuce plants and sprayed the
diseased cabbages with the liquor. Believe
it or not, the aphis disappeared and the
cabbages were not attacked again.
“Grunter”: If your chooks begin to die
mysteriously don’t take the gun to the pup.
Open ’em up and —in Queensland, at any
rate —you’ll probably find their crops full of
ants. It usually happens after rain, and a
small flying ant', a periodic visitor, generally
causes the trouble. Knowing this won’t save
the chooks, but it may save the pup.
“A.G.”: A simpler plan to avoid tick than
“Lucerne Flea’s” (B. 5/6/’3O) is to swing
your perches. Cut the necks off stout bottles,
cork tightly and run a strong skewer through
each; turn up the point into a hook. , Filled
with water, kerosene or dip, these make
insulators ticks ca<nnot cross.
“Disc Harrow” : Save the dirty oil from the
tractor and car. It can be used for spraying
with the ordinary red oil. It may be emulsi-
fied readily with a strong solution of soap,
and can then be tipped straight into the vat.
“Koremburra”: If a nut works loose m
a farm implement, and no spanner is avail-
able, an S hook will often serve the purpose.
“Bagman”: A handy contrivance when
putting a pump in a well is to bore a hole
in the pipe about 3ft. above the ground and
screw a tap into it. This will give you cool
water when the mill is pumping, and by
connecting a hose from your tank and open-
ing the taps you can prime your pump
without the trouble of climbing up the pipe.
“Disc Harrow”: A discourager for hares
is cow-dung and lime mixed to a thick paste
with water. Apply to stems of young trees
with a brush or piece of bag.

What is the best method of striking roses
from cuttings and the best time to plant
them? My land is at an elevation of 900 ft.
and subject to fairly heavy frosts. —7198.
Put them in in the early spring or late
autumn. Pieces of matured green wood
about the thickness of a pencil and from
six to nine inches long should be firmly
planted in light sandy soil and kept moist
but not damp for a few weeks, when a
large percentage of the cuttings should have
struck. They should not be taken up for
at least three months.
Method of preparing greasy merino wool
for making padded quilt or mattresses ?—-
7027.
Make a wash consisting of one dessert-
spoon of washing-soda to a gallon of hot
water. Soak the wool in this for half an
hour. Stir around, then pour water off
and soak in a fresh solution. Keep the
water fairly hot, and change till you get
the grease out. Add a good soap extract
to the final wash. Rinse in clear water,
and spread to dry. When nearly dry tease
wool out with fingers. While washing, pack
the wool loosely in bags made of mosquito
\et.

What causes it to burn, and, how long has
it been bunting? —73o7.
It is 208 miles from Sydney, and is passed
by the N.S.W. main northern railway. A
thick seam of coal is slowly burning, emit-
ting through fissures, over about half an
acre up the southward hillside, more or less
smoke; the emission is not always visible.
The presence of sulphur-compounds and
vapors suggest that sulphur oxidisation
generated heat which started the fire,
If miles north of its present site, over 2000
years ago.

ing in the Richmond River district of
N.S.W. So far as we are aware spotted-
gum leaves are not being worked. (2)
Matter for detailed analysis. Obtain free
pamphlets, “Australian Tea-trees of Econo-
mic Value” and “Eucalyptus,” from Tech-
nological Museum, Harris-street, Sydney.
Before the war the Mint par of exchange
between London and Paris was 25.2215
francs to £. (1) Was the pure-gold con-
tent of 2000 British sovs. then equivalent to
2522 gold napoleons, assuming all coins to be
full weight? (2) Does it now take 3.2,421 of
the napoleons to equal 2000 sovs.? (3) Does
the gold 20-franc piece contain less of this
metal than formerly? —72ll.
(1) Yes. (2) The na*poleon always con-
tains the same quantity of gold, but instead
of being worth 20 francs it is worth 100
francs. (3) No new 20-franc gold pieces
have been struck.
(3) Would it be possible to hear 4QG

in New Guinea are paid £BOO to £lOOO p.a.
without right of private practice.
(3) Docs Argentina produce much lucerne?
(2) Is lucerne another name for alfalfa?—
1214.
(1) Lucerne is grown on 20,000,000 acres,
carrying 350,000,000 cows, sheep and horses.
(2) Yes.
How can I estimate what size disc of
silver is required to make a cup bowl or egg-
shaped?—'7ll3.
The trade rule, in the case of an egg-
shaped bowl, is to allow a radius of three-
quarters of the height. For a semi-spherical
bowl a radius of the full height is allowed.
It is impossible to estimate exactly the
amount of stretch in the metal, this depend-
ing on the alloy used and the skill of the
spinner.
(1) What is the procedure in adopting a
child, (2) The child comes from Victoria.
Will I have to go back there to have the
matter attended to, or can everything be
done here in N.5.W.? —7299.
(1) Write to the Master in Equity’s
Department, Supreme Court House, Eliza-
beth-street, Sydney. (2) The consent of
parents, or, if only one living, his or her
consent; or, if illegitimate, then the consent
of the mother only is required. It should
be possible to arrange the matter by cor-
respondence.
(1) Recipe for a white paint for fibro-
ccmcnt (outside)? (2) Would lime and raw
oil be sufficient? —6918.
(1) Use a cold-water paste paint, adding
half a pint of raw linseed oil to 141 b. of
paint before the addition of water. (2) No.
But you can make a fairly satisfactory paint
by adding three pints of boiled linseed oil
to 141 b. of cement.
(1) How does Germany compare with
other nations in the matter of inventive
genius? Are not the Germans imitators
rather than originators? (2) What are the
leading inventions, and the nationality of
their inventors? (3) What part did Hertz
play in the invention of wireless communi-
cation?—7olo.
(1) In the matter of the devising of
machines, the discovery of natural principles
and the development of art men of German
parentage have a distinguished record. The
internal combustion engine, which has pro-
foundly affected the realms of transport
and power generation, and which has made
possible the automobile and the aeroplane,
is due mainly to the work of three Ger-
mans—Otto, Deisel and Daimler. Ein-
stein. a German, lias amplified the cosmic
generalisations of Isaac Newton. Bach,
Beethoven . and Wagner, all Germans, are
recognised as supreme geniuses of music.
Goethe, a German, ranks on a par with
Shakspeare, of whom he was in no way an
imitator, as a literary giant. (2) That is a
matter of opinion, and there is a diversity of
records concerning the individuals-who dis-
covered the principles upon which the most
useful machines of to-day are constructed.
For instance, while the Americans claim for
Morse the invention of the telegraph, for
Bell the telephone and for Edison the phono-
graph, the cinema and the incandescent elec-
tric lamp, well-supported claims are made on
behalf of investigators of other nations in
respect of, these inventions. (3) Hertz estab -
lished the emanation of electric waves from
highly-charged rings' of metal. -Marconi
applied the discovery of the uses of tele-
graphy.
Can you tell me something about the aero-
plane recently built in England for convey-
ance in a submarine? —742o.
It is a small two-seater reconnaissance
twin-float seaplane driven by a 335-h.p.
engine. It lias an air endurance of two
hours, carries a load of 5001 b. and is capable
of being catapulted from the deck. It has
a top speed of 113 miles au hour. The wings
are folded for stowage, when the space occu-
pied is: span, Sft.; length, 22ft. 6-iin.;
height, Sft. llin.
(1) What has been the inci'ease in the
cost of farming implements in Australia
since 1920 ? (2) Increase of rail freights in
B.A. since 1920 ? (3) Average price of
wheat in Adelaide 1910-20 and 1920-30P —
6946.
(1) An importing firm says there has
been an increase of 40 to 45 per cent., but a
manufacturer says that prices have not
varied much. (2) On February 1, 1921,
there was au increase of 16-J per cent., and
on December 14, 1927. there was a further
increase of 20 per cent., with the exception
of classes 1, 2 and 3. (3) For the 10 seasons
1910-11 to 1919-20 the average price was
ss. 0.6 d., and for the 9 seasons 1920-21 to
1928-29 ss. 7.16 d.
There is a seepage of oil mixed with water
on my property. How can I separate the
water and 0i1? —7390.
If the quantity of oil in the seepage is
large it would be profitable to distil it.
If it is small use a cream separator. The
wide difference in specific gravity between
water and oil is sufficient to enable such a
machine to make a clean separation.
(1) What is the advantage of slotted
icings? (2) What is the price of a Junker
Junior all-metal monoplane? (3) What light
monoplanes are built by the Be Havilland
Co.? (4) Can slotted unngs be fitted to
light monoplanes? —7o6B.
(1) The lift of the main aerofoil is in-
creased at large angles of incidence. The
fitting of slots to thick wing sections gives
an increase of lift of 50 to 60 p.c. with a
delay in the stalling angle of about 14deg.
This means that there is more lateral con-
trol at and beyond the ordinary stalling
angle of incidence of the wings. (2) £l2OO
landed in Australia. (3) D. 11.53, Puss Moth
and Moth 111. (4) Yes.
■ How can I free my spaniel of H0e? —7414.
Wash him once a week in a warm 2 p.c.
solution of creolin. Ilis kennel should be
cleansed and disinfected, and all bedding
burned. A dusting of pyretlirum powder
will help.
I lire at Dcvonport ( Tas .). (1) What
steps should 1 take to get training as an air
pilot? (2) How long does training take, and
the cost? (3) What opportunities of em-
ployment are there for women pilots? —7o79.
(1) Join one of the aero clubs that give
training instruction. A section will be
operating very shortly at Launceston. In
the meantime the nearest club is in Vic. (2)
Time depends upon ,the aptitude of the pupil,
weather conditions : and on the number of
hours a day that can be devoted to training.
Pupils usually qualify in from 4 to 6 weeks.
It costs 50s. an hour to fly until a license is
obtained in Vic., - and solo 1 flying thereafter
costs 30s. an hour.' (3) Practically none in
commercial aviation at present, as the
majority of the positions are held by pilots
who had war experience.
(1) Method of preparing sardines and for-
mula for preserving same for marketing? (2)
Approximate cost of plant required and pros-
pects of obtaining sales in Australia? —73s3:
(1) Canning methods consist essentially
of washing, salting, cooking, drying, packing
and sterilising. In France, Spain and. Po-
rtugal the fish are dried, fried in oil and
packed, while in Scandinavia a smoking pro-
cess is commonly used to cook and dry the
fish before packing. (2) Can't estimate
cost of the plant. A good product would
have a big sale in Australia at a competitive
price, for the Australian sardine is of excel-
lent quality.
Is draw-poker a legal game in Victoria?—
7383.
It was decided in the case of Fowler v.
Davidson (Vic. Law Reports 356, 1918)
that poker is not a game of chance, and
may, therefore; be regarded as one of those
legal games into which the question of skill
enters.
(1) Fifty individuals buy one Common-
wealth. 6 per cent £lOO bond each. They
agree to pool 1 per cent, of the interest and
to draw for the £5O annually as one or more
prises. Is this legal in Australia? (2)'ls
this not the same principle as that on which
. premium bonds arc issued in Europe?- —7362.
(1) It would be punishable under the
Vagrancy (Amendment) Act, 1905 (N.S.W.),
which makes the disposal of money by lot-
tery or chance an “unlawful game.” Similar
legislation in other States. (2) Not exactly.
In the case of recent French premium bond
issues the State conducts a lottery and allots
prizes.
Can a municipal council in N.B.W. charge
interest on rates not paid by June 30 f The
rates arc paid in advance. —7267.
By statute law rates are payable to the
council on the expiration of one month after
the service of the rate notice. If rates are
unpaid at the expiration of three months from
due date, interest at 7 per cent, per annum
can be charged.
(1) Is the climate of Rabaul {Hew
Guinea) injurious to the health of white
women? (2) Arc there schools for children?
(3) What is the white population? (4)
Any civic conveniences? (5) Amusements,
sports and social functions? (6) Cost of
living as . compared with Sydney? (7) Is
the climate ..suitable for flower and vegetable
gardens?- —7277.
(1) No, provided reasonable care is taken.
(2) Yes, though it would be advisable to
send them to Australia when they reach high-
school standard. (3) At.,; June 30, 1929,
3928. (4) Water supply is derived from
house tanks. Lighting is mostly by kero-
sene lamps, but there are several private
electric-light plants in operation. The ques-
tion of installing a civic electric-light service
is receiving consideration. (5) Plenty of
social life, and ample facilities for recreation.
(6) About 50 per cent, higher. (7) Suit-
able for the growth of tropical fruits, flowers
and vegetables. Certain fruits and vege-
tables used in Australia do not grow in the
Territory, and must be imported.

Two and a half million words could not say
as much for Philips Valves as the two and a
half million "Miniwatts" which have now
been sold in Australia.
Soon these valves which are accepted as
standard throughout the world, will be mado
in Australia by the collaboration of Aus-
tralian technicians and the Philips engineers
who have already made the enviable name
these valves possess.

brom speech by ex-Prime Minister Bald-
win, reported by cable:—
“1 am told that unless I make peace with the
newspaper magnate Lord Rothermere, his candidates
wdl run all over the county. Mr. Lloyd George’s
candidates in the last election smelt. These will
stink. I have been told that the gloves are off.
If they are, we shall see who has dirty hands.
Before I saw Lord Beaverbrook for the first time,
in March, his emissary came to me. This will
probably be denied, but I have proof. If there is
a revolution, Lord Rothermere will be the first
man to go to the south of France,”
From speech by ex-Prime Minister Lloyd
George, also reported by cable
“I am going to take off the gloves, too. Mr
Baldwin’s language is not merely offensive, but
coarse and vulgar in the extreme. When 1 read

We have pleasure in adding a few reports

From speech by ex-Mayor of Slugtown:—
The so-called newspaper magnate Bill Weevil, of
the “Slug-town Mail,” has called me a fool, a liar
and a cocktail and has said I stink. Well, ladies
and gents, I now propose to take off the gloves to
this so-called editor. The pig-trough’s the right
place for him. Who saved Weevil from quod and
gave him a chance to get where he is? I did. I
expect he’ll deny it, being a born liar, but he’d
have got a richly-deserved sentence for embezzle-
ment if it hadn’t been for me. You wouldn’t think
to see Bill slinging his weight round now that he
was a “physical reject” in the war. Physical
reject! Bah ! He was frightened to go.
From speech by Slugtown’s recently dis-
missed Sanitary Inspector:—
With regard to the coarse and vulgar abuse as
is being indulged in by our ex-Mavor and the
editor of the “Mail,” I’ve simply got this to say:
If ever there was a dirty, lying crook, it’s Bill
Weevil, and if ever a Mayor deserved to be grabbed
by the ratepayers and dumped in a pig-sty, then
that thieving old skite Buggins does. If I told
you half I know about him there’d be a riot. I
merely, state at present that our ex-Mayor is a
filthy hog who couldn’t go straight or tell the truth
if he tried—and that goes for Bill Weevil, too.
From speech by Mr. Mudslinger, K.C.: —
X turn, gentlemen, from the harrowing subject
of my innocent client who standsi before you
charged with murder to the man who is trying to
ruin him. I refer to Police-Constable Bruiser.
X propose to take the gloves off to Bruiser. In
addition to being as big a liar, cur and cad as any
British Prime Minister of recent times, he is a
congenital idiot who imagines lie will be able to
persuade you that the splendid citizen in the .dock
shot one of his mates dead and cut the throat of
another. I will prove by Mr. Spike Thugge’s
evidence that Bruiser is a menace to society who
should have been behind the bars long ago. Call
Mr. Thugge.
Short Dialogue:—
P.-C. Bruiser: “I want a word with you Spike.
It’s about what you said of me in court.
Mr. Thugge : “Aw! 'Ave an ’eart! I never
meant it. Gorstrooth X didn’t. Why”——
P.-C. Bruiser; “Kerm on. We can’t have the
public’s mind polluted by abusive language. You’re
vagged.” 10-2-4.
HOW AUSTRALIA WAS SAVED.
A perturbing situation had arisen in the
1)< fence J (apartment.
An inva di n g
army had landed
and was advancing
rapidly on the capi-
tal. The Austra-
lian Army might
have been useful,
but most of it was
unfortunately ab-
sent on a compul-
sory month’s leave
without pay.
The permanent
head of the depart-
ment was at his
wits’ end. He had
looked in vain for
guidance from the
Defence Act, Pub-
lic Service Act and
departmental regu-
lations and was
scanning the Mass
Picketing Act as a
last resort when
Angus McWlioozle,
a junior clerk, hur-
ried in. His dour
Scotch pertinacity
had found a way
out.
“This, sir, is a
copy of the Kellogg
Ren u n ciation of
War Pact,” he
said, handing the
document to his
superior. “You will
note that the sig-
natories, including
the invaders, have
bound themselves
to settle inter-
national disputes
by a r b i tration.
They have, sir, in
my opinion laid
themselves open to
legal proceedings.”
“My boy, you
have saved Aus-
tralia],” declared
his chief. “I shall
see that you are not
forgotten. Fetch
me Form XYZ
224,342 (the blue one that looks like a
summons), and I’ll have it served on their
General at once. My word, we’ll have the
law on them over this. And they did it
on a Sunday, too.”
Yes, dear readers, that brave boy who
kept his head in Australia’s darkest hour
is now Sir Angus McWoozlo, permanent
head of the Defence Department and
president of the Peace At Any Price
League. q.q
* *
He went into a public bar
Optimistically.
Within an hour he caught a car,

“Allen hit Ponsford twice in one over, but he

It takes more than that to put the Mel-
bournite out.

“Crimmett’s howling was again applauded.”
— “News.”
On the ground, no doubt, that it was a
perfect scream.

which Americans could honestly celebrate with the
knowledge that the repressive 18th Amendment was
repealed.”— Cable.

Which caused him so much fuss,
That with an irritated “Damn!”

DOMESTIC CRICKET.
“Home entertaining is becoming more and more
‘the thing.’ — “Guardian.”
Blinker took strike, as usual. Mrs.
Blinker, bowling from the sideboard end,
sent down three fast soup-plates for a
maiden. However,
the non-smoking,
non-drinking cham-
pion was unusually
slow in striking
form, her length
being erratic.
Blinker was mean-
while giving a
chanceless display
at cover. Suddenly
improving her pace
and length, Mrs.
B. started to place
attractive shots all
round the brain-
box, and a hurri-
cane attack with
the milk jug and
sugar basin had the-
boy from Slugurbia
badly demoralised.
The bowling had
now taken complete
charge and always
looked dangerous.
Blinker’s frequent
appeals drew forth
ironic cheers from
the crowd next
door. He replied by
sending a decanter
over the fence with
h flood of curses.
This quietened the
barracking but not the bowling. The end
came with dramatic suddenness. In attempt-
ing a tricky side-step Blinker went down
to a mystery shot for the full count. Scores :
one up, one down.

WHERE HONOR RULES.
“The betting business is based on honor. A book-
maker has no security other than trust in his cus-
tomer’s probity.”— Vie. bookie in press interview.
“Jus’ what I alius told yer,” said my
friend, Joe the Urger, deftly abstracting a
packet of cigarettes from the maimed sol-
dier’s stall while the proprietor was rearrang-
ing the goods. “It's different from the crook

“POUND POWER” EIGHT.
That’s why you’ve never seen any-
thing like it before. That’s why it’s
the smartest car made
For this sensational new car de-
velops more power per pound weight
than any car of its size ever built
(racing cars alone excepted).
Take this great car for a demonstration
drive. Feel the overlapping power
impulses of its eight great cylinders.
Feel the utter smoothness of its down-
draft carburetion and spring-cushioned
engine Then you’ll know what
“first in Pound Power” means.
You dominate traffic juSt because
you’ve got more power under your
control. You know that this new
Oakland’s 70 measured miles per hour,

ing body, road-hugging 117-inch
wheelbase and turn-to-a-touch steer-
ing make the new Oakland V-8 a safe
car always perfectly controlled.
A LONG-LIFE CAR
There’s an engineering Story behind
the new Oakland V-8. It was designed
by men with 16 years’ experience of
8-cylinder construction. They built
n different 8-cylinder engines, and 49
complete test cars. All were scrapped.
Then at last, after three years research,
they produced the “Pound Power” car,
the new Oakland V-8
They built for speed, power, smooth-
ness —but above all for Strength.
Here’s an engine compaff and staunch.
The solid-block cylinders, short
rigid crankshaft, low engine speed and
low piston travel mean exceptionally
long life and low upkeep costs.
And the price is amazingly low.
This magnificently powered eight-
cylinder Oakland Stays in the price-
range of six-cylinder cars, with six-
cylinder running costs.
Sold under General Motors’ One
Year Standard Warranty, the new
Oakland V-8 can be purchased under
the liberal terms of the G.M.A.C. Time
Payment Plan. Oakland service avail-
able everywhere. Buy from your local
dealer.

“Mick”: Kubelik is billed all over the
country not as a master of melody but as
the man with the £25,000 violin. Well,
recent events in Sydney and elsewhere would
suggest that we are only a nation of sen-
sation-mongers.
“Say Bo” : Almost every Trans-Pacific boat
carries one or more screen-struck flappers to-
wards the Mecca of their sex, so the follow-
ing item of information from Hollywood
might be interesting. First National adver-
tised for 32 chorus girls to form a permanent
gang. Over 5000 applied.
“S.T.S.”: It has always been a safe
maxim for actresses in pathetic parts, “Don’t
make any noise when you cry.” Silent grief
brings sympathy; the noisy sort gives the
audience a faint annoyance. This is 11
times more important in talkies, where the
machine gives out gasping gulps and the
annoyance is not faint. Why don’t pro-
ducers realise it? My sympathy goes out
to the owner of a strange feminine voice
that I lately heard exclaim in the dark at
a should-be sorrowful moment, “Why, she’s
as bad as A 1 Jolson!”
“Lever de Rideau”: Of interest to liis-
trions is the decision of a Paris Court in
a case in which a Chicago millionaire pro-
ceeded against a manager for billing his
wife in a variety turn at a cabaret without
his consent. The Court came to the conclu-
sion that the husband was injured in his
dignity and assessed the damages at £4OO,
plus £24 royalties for every performance in
which his wife appeared.
“Stephen Sink’j Years ago at Adelaide
Royal, Lawrance Dunbar, Last of the Silk-
hat Murderers, was once, and once only,
cast for the heroic role while the regular
hero had a bout with adenoids. Dunbar
put his glossy moustache in his make-up
box and, dashing on the stage, clean-shaven,
saved the heroine from a low-down cur.
Regular patrons were both astonished and
puzzled. The customary applause for heroic
deeds was missing. Then came the words
“Doris, my darling, though Heavens fall,
I will protect you from harm.” Dunbar
waited for the thunderous acclamation of
the gods. Instead there was dead silence,
broken at last by a voice from above, quiver-
ing with contempt: “Oh, you lyin’ dog!”
“Craiser”: One of these days a Tivoli
frequenter will write a psychology of laugh-
ter which will knock Bergson’s and Freud’s
works on the subject into back numbers.
Why, for instance, is it considered good
taste to make fun of the clergy of one
denomination and execrably bad form to
caricature those of another? An even more
curious thing is that what is funny at one
hour of the day ceases to be so at another.
Saturday-night audiences at the Melbourne
house are swept with gales of laughter every
time Jim Gerald removes his hat with a
certain comic gesture, while matinee audi-
ences remain dumb as fishes when he per-
forms precisely the same action in the after-
noon.
“F.S.”: Leon Gordon’s next farewell
appearance will probably be in “Calendar,”
the latest J.C.W. purchase from the Edgar
Wallace factory. Unlike its predecessors, it
is a racing melodrama, and dialogue takes
the place of revolver shots and the dying
groans of poisoned Chinamen.
“Sceneshifter”: After George Edwardes
had found a goldmine in “The Merry
Widow,” the Fogtown managers to a man
went to the Continent in search of more.
They unearthed so many that the English
composer found the remnant of his occupa-
tion gone. Thousands of pounds of English
money lay in Germany and Austria, deposited
on opera options when the war broke out.
That Edwardes should die as a prisoner of
war in Austria was the grimness of satire.
“Cine Ma”: The “Disraeli” film has been
praised as providing a brilliant facsimile of
the British statesman, but Arthur A.' Bau-
mann, a London company director, has a
different opinion. He said recently, “I went
to see ‘Disraeli.’ I hope I shall not be
held up for libel when I say that the filmed
Disraeli was no more like the late Lord
Bea con sfield than I am—less, in fact.” He
heard Disraeli make his speech in the House
of Lords on his return from Berlin in
1878, so is one of the few men now living
competent to criticise George Arliss’s make-
up.
“Cauboy”: Carton’s comedy “Lord and
Lady Algy” delighted our grandmothers—
it ran for over 300 nights in London —
despite its bad construction and its dull and
meaningless second act, just as a similarly
poor piece of work would delight the modern
playgoer. But its disappointed revivalists
in Melbourne forgot that its blemishes were
overlooked by our ancestors because of the
general freshness which it then had but
now so conspicuously lacks. Thus it must
have been terribly daring for a playwright
in 1898 to make a couple quarrel, not merely
because the wife smoked, but because she
smoked a brand of cigarettes which her
husband disliked.
“Flinders”: With the sale of the Royal
imminent and His Majesty’s a burnt-out
shell, which is unlikely to be reconditioned
for the drama, legit, in Melbourne will
shortly be confined to the Comedy, the
King’s and the Tivoli. Future musical com-
edies will probably be presented at the last-
named. The Tiv. stage is actually larger
than that of His Majesty’s in London, and
lias accommodated several big shows. “Chu
Chin Chow” had an outing there eight years I
ago. Oscar Asche was not in the cast, but
the rafters had to carry a principal of
equal tonnage in the gigantic Steyne.
“Hamfat”: Harry Jowett, who died in
America the other day, was one of the first
Australian-born mummers who went abroad
to conquer ■ over 3S years ago he was a
juvenile with George Rignold. A handsome
fellow, with a fine rolling voice, he landed
a stage-job immediately he reached San
Francisco. In the U.S.A. he remained, doing
his regular circuit annually and becoming a
sort of national institution.
“Craiser”: Nancy Weir,, the 14-year-old
pianist who staggered Melbourne last year by
emerging from a convent school and playing
Beethoven concertos with the aplomb of a
Brailowsky and without any score, has so
impressed the great Scnabel that he has
undertaken to complete the training which
Miss Freeman began. Incidentally, he con-
tradicted sundry local pessimists by remark-
ing that the girl’s early training could not
have been improved.
“Say Bo” : Australians in the film indus-
try are not all located at Hollywood. Amongst
expatriates in British Dominion Film studios
in England are Cyril Ritchards, Eve Grey,
Dorothy Seacombe, Cyril McLaglen and
Trilby Clark, an Adelaide damsel at present
appearing in an Edgar Wallace shockodrama.
“Bond”: Tallulah Bankhead is considered
to have challenged the star actresses of the
past in reviving “Camille” in London. The
critics differ amazingly in opinion, but it
boils down to about this. (1) The play
now seems poor old-fashioned sob-stuff. (2)
1930 may not be more moral than 1830, but
it is a lot less sentimental, and sees Camille’s
profession for what it is; thus audiences
tend to sympathise with Armand’s father
rather than with the lovers. (3) Tallulah
is no Bernhardt; but she does “make ’em
cry,” which is the acid test of success.
“N’Yoik”: Beppie de Vries, the sweet-
voiced Dutch girl who entranced Australian
aitdiences with her accent in “The Student
Prince,” has scored a success in Chicago in
a revival of “The Merry Widow.”
“C. Ma” : It looks as if R. C. Sherriff may
be another example of the one-play writer.
His “Badger’s Green,” a village comedy, lost,
its author and promoters £l3OO in nine per-
formances at the Prince of Wales.
From an Australian theatrical colony:
Hollywood is smothered with Australians.
It must be the gum-trees that lure them.
There are so many that I could not name
them all, but just round our little spot we
have Mabel Gibson, Trilby Clark, who has
just arrived from London; and May and
Benny Beatty are at the end of the road.
Leyland Hodgson, Reginald Dandy, Frederick
Bentley, Toots Pounds, Robert Chisholm and
many others are within a stone’s throw, so
an Aussie cannot be lonely in Hollywood.
They are successful, more or less, but it is
a hard battle to break through the ropes.
Claude Flemming is producing for Brown-
Nagel, who are making a series of musical
fantasies with the world-famous Creatore
and other well-known bands.
“Ngatik” : Former heavyweight boxer Jack
Johnson now makes plenty of money lead-
ing a jazz band of 12 in Tin Pan Alley,
Broadway, where cabaret life is of the
brightest. Tommy Burns runs a restaurant
in the same locality.
“Flinders” : Kubelik, now touring Australia,
is a composer as well as a violinist, though
his works are not as well known as they
deserve to be. He seldom consents to per-
form them himself, but they are treated with
respqct by European musicians. He has
written six concertos for violin and orchestra,
as well as a host of smaller items.
“Pauly”: Eric Maxon, who was here with
H. B. Irving, and remained to be Aus-
tralia’s second “Ben Ilur,” has scored as
Cassius, Lysander, Cassio and other parts
in the Stratford Shakspearean performances
at the temporary Memorial Theatre. Gordon
Bailey, here with a Nellie Stewart, troupe,
also scored as Shallow, Starveling and Don
John. On the birthday of the Bard, the
ceremony of the unfurling of flags was as
picturesque as usual. S'Heni'y Barwell, from
Adelaide, did the honors for Australia.
“Cine Ma” : Said that a large organisation
is to make a big talkie that will place this
country on the map in the cinematograph
world. The proposed director is a gentle-
man of considerable attainments, but, as
far as I can discover, he has taken no
important part in the production of a modern
talking-picture. Anybody with the smallest
knowledge of the vocal film knows that mak-
ing talking pictures is entirely different
from making silents. Even after years of
experience none of the big producers has
mastered the new medium. It will be a
pity if once again, through lack of the right
people, we fail to make successful pictures
in Australia. To repeat the disasters, artis-
tic and financial, which attended the produc-
tion of silent pictures in Victoria when the
quota system came in, will set back the
local industry indefinitely. There is no
earthly reason why good pictures cannot
be made in Australia, with a wealth of
theatrical talent walking the streets of every
capital. If the objection is to the importa-
tion of foreign producers, there are several
Australians in Hollywood and England who
are at or near the top of the tree in sound
production.
The Inky Way
“Lao-dah”: New York frowns heavily on
literary thieves. A journalist who stole a
story complete and sold it for £2B, got three
years.
As far as The Bulletin knows, no long
story has been published about newspaper
life * in Australia, and nobody is better
equipped to supply the deficiency than Monty
Grover. His “Thirty Pieces of Silver” is
largely about newspaper men and their work,
beginning with a country (N.S.W. South
Coast ) bi-weekly to which a local youngster
contributes a column for the honor and
glory of the thing, on to a big city office
into which the same youngster has climbed.
Percy Lindsay is to illustrate the story,
whose first chapters will appear on July 30.

Put Guinness la-

Put GUINNESS in in the lun-
cheon interval; it can be depended
on to “ score to provide you with
a good “ innings ” —to increase the
“total” of your strength and vigour.
Brewed only from Malt, Barley,
Hops, Yeast and Water, the inviting
colour, the delicious flavour, the
tonic and strengthening powers of
Guinness are due only to the natural
goodness it contains. Guinness is
easily digested and rapidly assimil-
ated —you feel invigorated at once
when youVe had a Guinness.

SHADOW SHOWS.
“Paramount on Parade’’ at Sydney Prince
Edward, does a lot to explain the U.S.A.’s
commercial supremacy. The so-called pro-
gramme has 15 pages of what Uncle Sam
calls ballyhoo, a half-page hosiery advt.,
and a half-page list of the seven “units.” It
is really an advertising dodger, and it costs
fid.! At some cinemas time for which the
public has paid is taken up with advts. in
the shape of extracts from coming shows.
“Paramount on Parade” is an extension of
this idea. It is a huge advt. for Paramount’s
stars at the prices charged for an ordinary
picture show —a joke on the public by a
financial humorist of genius. No one can
deny that it is a supremely good joke. The
stars are shown in their habit as they live-
having meals, chaffing one another, and bur-
lesquing their own acting. The last-named
is a shrewd device for winning the publics
affection. It humanises professional crooks,
and gives those who are dedicated to serious
parts a chance to show that they have a
comedy sense. About the funniest of the
many funny acts in this show is one in which
those who usually perform with the majestic
George Bancroft tell him what they think of
his art. Everyone who sees it will like him
more. A delightful skit on a murder play is
done by Clive Brook as Sherlock Holmes,
and William Powell and his off-sider Pai-
lette as themselves. Powell caricatures his
own - over-dressed mellifluousness on most
engaging lines. ■ ■ ,
Most of the others appear in specialist
roles, and some, such as Dennis King, in
parts they have already played. _ Ruth Ohat-
terton is lachrymose as a ruined French
girl in a bar full of soldiers. Clara Bow
is Clara Bow on a battleship. Chevalier
sings, grimaces and gesticulates with self-
conscious winsomeness, and Mitzi Green,
who must be one of the cleverest children
of her age living, does a gorgeous imitation
of him. Also there are some fifty others, all
good and some superlatively good. The
technicolor scenes are disappointing. The
pretentious rainbow set fails completely to
produce the illusion aimed at, and the focus-
sing of the figures is poor throughout. But
it is a great show on the whole. If only-
some of our national industries could get
paid for advertising themselves on similar
lines!
* ¥ *
“South Sea Rose,” at Melb. Regent, is an
attempt by Fox to put on the screen the sort
of show Frank Neil used to put on the stage.
Anybody who knows what a Neil show was
like will know all about “South Sea Rose. ’
The analogy is complete even in the charac-
ter who has his trousers forcibly removed
while he is in the act of caressing a< lady.
There is also the character who gets his
laughs out of a physical disability and the
character who gets hers by sitting on a
chair that isn’t there. If there is any impor-
tant difference, it lies in the fact that the
Messrs. Fox have been at great pains to give
heir farce a realistic background by photo-
graphing alleged tropical islands populated
by apparently real hula-hula girls. Lenore
lilric is the approved low comedy vamp,
though her face is of the unpopular kind. If
The Bulletin has any preference, it is for
the Neil show.
* * ¥
Critics of back-stagers often complain that
the fatuous song-plugger whose lady friends
fight over him is a myth. Well, here is
Harry Richman at Sydney Haymarket to
prove them wrong. He has experienced all
the emotional vicissitudes of the character
he plays in “Puttin’ on the Ritz” —and then
some, as he would say. His fatal allure
drove Clara Bow to talk of suicide (indeed
she went so far as to make a cautious stab
at herself) and Flo Stanley, who says she
was his when he was “only a piano-player
in a Rodeo Club,” is estimating the loss
of his affection in the Law Courts at £70,000.
Most people who see him in the new show
will wonder what all the fuss was about. He
is an ageing Hebrew with a thick nose, loose
nouth, mat of black hair, and Bowery accent.
He croons and dances adequately, but his
acting is poor and hq is without humor.
Virginal little Joan Bennett, who was so
well cast in “Disraeli,” is right out of the
picture as one of his adorers. Aileen Pringle
is more credible as the wife of a com-
plaisant old gentleman who trails round
with her while she makes assaults on Harry’s
virtue. Fortunately for morality his hobby
is bootleg whisky. The big dramatic moment
of the show comes when he is struck blind
by over-indulgence in the contents of his
dask —and very funny it is. There are some
undistinguished songs by Irving Berlin, and
a well-produced ballet.
# * «
Australia is still importing its worst
news-reels from the U.K. The most stirring
of half a dozen topical items in a recent
British batch was of the London Zoo at the
bears’ feeding-time, and most of the other
subjects were as stale as that. Yet the
studios at Elstree, WHwyn, etc., have hun-
dreds of subjects of Empire-, if not world-
interest waiting to be filmed at their very
gates. For example, five minutes outside
the Mitre at Oxford in term-time; a flying
day at Hendon; the Ashton brothers in
action at Ranelagh ; a meet of the Coaching
Club in Hyde Park: tanks on Salisbury
Plain; a big day at Newmarket, or an R.N.
squadron at sea. At present the Fox Movie-
tone people are giving better pictures of
Britain than any British organisation. A
recent Fox Gazette showed the King at a
Cup Tie final, the Australians at Worcester
with Fairfax *nd Bradman batting, and a
German dirigible passing over London —the
first to do it since the war. America gets
a heap of valuable trade through news-
reels. Britain could do the same, and so,
for that matter, could Australia.
“Rookery Nook,” which has already been
applauded by The Bulletin’s Melbourne
critic, is now booming at Sydney State
Theatre. It deserves to. The writer, who
saw it performed by the same cast at London
Aldwich Theatre, actually found it funnier
as a talkie than it was as a play. The
acting is more finished in the talkie version,
and no points are slurred. Evidently the
biggest threat to Hollywood’s supreniacy is
the transference to the screen of British
companies on a wholesale scale.

“My Chevrolet Six
has done 12,000 miles over
made roads and bush tracks
. . repair expense , nil
. . running costs , less than the Four’s,”
says Westralian country store-
keeper and carrier
AND the service Mr. Gray of
l Karragullen, W.A., asks of
his Chevrolet Six 30-cwt. Truck
is typical of what thousands of
owners require. He carts for his
store —hauls timber and logs—
carries merchandise to timber
camps—does the heavy haulage
work his territory demands.
12,000 miles of heavy going,
and not a penny for repairs !
While, of course, not every Chev-
rolet Truck owner will achieve
such a record, it is by no means
unusual for Chevrolet. Chev-
rolet’s famous low upkeep and
low petrol consumption are
cutting haulage costs for owners
Australia over.
Wherever motor trucks are
used, Chevrolet is on the job.
It works as only Chevrolet can.
It keeps faith with its owner’s
customers. It builds goodwill—
enlarges business increases
profits.
Little wonder then that the
first Chevrolet Truck so often
leads to a fleet—that Chevrolet
Truck owners are favoured in
the keen rivalry of to-day’s condi-
tions.
Chevrolet’s low price can be
financed on easy G.M.A.C. terms,
if desired. Your local dealer will
gladly arrange a demonstration.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
By winning the V.R.C. Grand National
Hurdle, Mosstrooper proved himself one of
the greatest jumpers that Australia has pro-
duced. Last winter this son of Kenilworth
ran Sandhurst to a neck in the Grand
National Steeplechase, and in the following
month lie appropriated the Australian
Hurdle and Australian Steeplechase, formerly
known as “the Caulfield Nationals.” Gus
Rowell, who is rather a* wizard with timber-
toppers, gave Mosstrooper a long rest before
putting him in training for this year’s jump-
ing events. His ambition is to land the
Flemington double, which so far has been
captured by only one horse —Redleap. Septi-
mus Miller’s great jumper carried list. 121 b.
in the hurdle and 13st. 31b. in the steeple-
chase. Mosstrooper had lOst. 71b. last
Saturday, and is handicapped at list. I.olb.
in the cross-country event.
Melbourne punters had a brain wave when,
on the eve of the race, they discarded
Swahilli and made Mosstrooper a pronounced
favorite, at twos, for the G. N. Hurdle.
Having accounted for his great rival on two
recent occasions, Swahilli was logical first
choice ; however, the public regarded Percy
Padfield’s representative as insufficiently
seasoned and pinned their faith to a proved
performer. Swahilli never was at home over
the stiff Flemington hurdles, which have no
lean worth speaking about. He fell before
a* circuit of the course had been completed
and brought down Olina. These disasters
may not have affected the result, as Swahilli
was travelling badly, but if Bay of Biscay
had not. come to grief five furlongs from
home he might have troubled Mosstrooper.
With that Adelaide candidate out of the
way,Mosstrooper carried R. N. Harris to
brilliant victory.
The heavy support accorded to Tirade
was a course-betting surprise. From 7 to 1
1 >arcy Eccles’s horse was backed down
to 9 to 2, and went out nearly as much in
demand as Swahilli. Public form did not
warrant this plunge, and the regular body
of punters shed no tears when Tirade was
beaten into third place by the 20-to-l chance
Johnny Cake, whose display astonished turf
students. Worst luck in the race was sus-
tained by Tresolaus. This bay son of Chry-
solaus had been moving like a potential
winner when another horse jumped on him
along the river side. Tresolaus received a
severe cut below his near hind fetlock, and
finished the course on three legs.
Affirm, who ran second to Textile in the
Caulfield Cup in 1927, earned his spurs as
a hurdler in maiden company at Flemington.
He also was a 5-to-2 favorite. Affirm is
held on lease by the trainer, T. J. Hayes,
who ended a long run of “outs” on this
occasion. Because of a suspicion of un-
soundness, he was withdrawn from the Grand
National Hurdle several weeks before it came
on for decision. If all right on the day he
may gain further laurels in the Doutta
Gaila Hurdle.
Land of Nod, original favorite for the
V.R.C. Myross Handicap, was left at the
post, and Frank Dempsey made no effort to
chase the field. Victory rested with Lith
Beau (4 to 1), owned by R. J. Litligow,
secretary of the Yarra Glen club. The
Iramoo Welter went to Bangkok (5 to 1)
after a tight tussle with the unlucky
Temoin, and El Rey discounted his Caul-
field Cup chance by missing a situation in
the Winter Handicap, for which he was
favorite. Lampra (6 to 1) won from the
fast-finishing Third King (16 to 1) and
Dark Dawn (6 to 1).
Iventle, owned by the V.R.C. chairman,
L. K. S. Mackinnon, annexed the Kensing-
ton Steeple, at 5 to 2, in such excellent style
NOO YE KEN.
“What’s Mack hanging back and playing slow for?”
“Oh he’s hoping the caddie will die of old age before he gets round.”
that at the close of the afternoon he became
a hot favorite for the Grand _ National
Steeple, with Mosstrooper next in request
and Night Lark third choice. Other aspir-
ants (including last year’s hero Sandhurst)
were almost contemptuously regarded. So
far Iventle has had only two outings over
stiff timber. lie struck one or two fences
on Saturday, and in a fast-run contest such
as the Grand National will be he may come
to grief. The Bulletin scribe believes
that Night Lark will rake in the money,
lie is the most perfect jumper in training,
and showed speed for a ’chaser by making
a dead-heat with Donace over a mile on the
flat at Moonee Valley on June 25. Owner
and trainer are confident that Night Lark
will see out the three miles and a furlong.
Mosstrooper appears to be next best, and
Namera is always worth backing for a place.

“Don Crew”: “Talkin’ of bettin’,” said
Skinny, “reminds me of a race meeting I
struck in a cocky district. The bookies
was a reel scratch lot dug up from local
talent, and when they started to bet on the
first race deuces the field was on offer. After
a bit, one chap gamer than the rest offers
five to two the favorite, and a bloke in a
cartwheel hat floats up to him and says:
‘l’ll have five hundred to two hundred Flash
Harry.” Another cove takes the odds to four
hundred, and a big bloke in a panama backs
Flasii Harry to win him three thousand.
‘Cripes!’ I says to a bloke standin’ near.
‘These country coves are pretty solid
bettors.’ ‘Not 1 so bad, considerin’,’ says
he, ‘ln*t it’ll cost them a bit for cartage if
they lose. They’re all bettin’ in spuds.’ ”
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Jack Roberts, of Newcastle (N.S.W.),
who believes in hitting ’em hard and often,
made short work of Welshman Freddie
Welsh at Sydney Stadium after a brisk pur-
suit of the fleeting enemy. Not that Welsh
voluntarily back-pedalled—that necessity
was forced upon him by his masterful oppo-
nent, who used both hands to such telling
effect that the visitor sought the canvas
five times in Imin. 40sec. On the last occa-
sion the ref. stepped in and sent the battered
Briton back to the dressing-room. Each
lad weighed 9st 91b.
Geo. Kotsonaros (Gist. 91b.) was the
latest patient on whom Howard Cantonwine
(15st. 71b.) operated for the edification of
Melbourne’s wrestling addicts. Howard
made valiant efforts to convince patrons that
lie was frequently in dire distress. With
a Boston crab in the sixth round Canton-
wine gained the only fall.

A 38,000 crowd got all the thrills it could
expect for its ninepence at Carlton Oval on
Saturday, when the local men entertained
Collingwood. Fast, keen play, with a despe-
rate finish, definitely placed Carlton a shade
ahead. They marked grandly, but the ’Wood-
men kept the play close, always backing up,
and with a lead of 3 goals or so they looked
to be winners. Just after starting the last
quarter they raised their lead to 4 goals, but
two clean-cut thrusts brought Carlton two
goals ; then the struggle began. Systematically
Collingwood worked round the wing, but
could only score behinds. Carlton’s drives
were equally ineffective, until but 2 points
separated them. They were playing “time
off” and the Collingwood barraekers Avert:
praying for the bell. Then Vallance whipped
up the ball in the pack, shot it to Clover, and
the resultant goal gave Carlton a 4-point
win—ll 6 points to 112. Of the other teams
Richmond put it all over Melbourne with
104 points to 52, thereby displacing the oppo-
sition from “The Four” ; Essendon kept their
place among the elect by outing St. Kilda
by 98 points to 74; and Geelong downed
Footscray by 98 to 58. Two Avilling scrim-
mages ended in HaAvthorn scoring 81 points
to North Melbourne’s 77, and South Mel-
bourne compiling 94 to Fitzroy’s 84.

The second Test between the British Rugby
side and the All Blacks Avas played in the
rain at Christchurch, the home team win-
ning 13-10 after a gruelling go, during which
Murray, the English half, Avent off injured.
He had been in great buckle, and his absence
in the last quarter handicapped the visitors
considerably. In Corner, of Wellington, play-
ing his first game as an All Black halfback,
M.L. considers it has found a champion.

Rugby Union club matches in Sydney on
Saturday left Randwick at the head of the
Schute Shield table with 14 points. The
leaders got home from Eastern Suburbs on
the Coogee Oval quagmire, Jim Carlton and
cricketer Marks each notching a try. The
Eastern halves, Thicknesse and I’aillass,
played capital football. At the Cricket
Ground, Western Suburbs unexpectedly
doAvned the Manly mudlarks by 15-8, while
University slipped another notch against
Northern Suburbs on the latter’s Oval, the
'Shoremen scoring 16-0. Glebe-Balmain and
St. George had a rare go at mud-slinging on
Uni. Oval, the Saints succumbing by three
points—scores, 11-8.
The N.S.W. Rugby League had bad luck
in striking vile Aveather for the debut of
the M.L. side at Sydney Agricultural
Ground. Open play was impossible, and con-
ditions suited the hard-rucking visiting for-
wards. In spite of that the home side won
16-5, the score being made up of 4 tries,
2 goals to a try and a goal. Though some
of the visiting backs showed avcll on occa-
sion, notably Watene, a speedy Maori
Avinger, they lack polish. The forwards
played a capital game on the day and gave
the opposition backs a lot of trouble. On
a dry ground, however, the N.S.W. back
division looks good for a Bradman score.
McMillan was again solid for N.S.W. at
fullback, while the veteran Dufty also gave
a solid exhibition opposite. The country
player Kingston was far the best of the
home forwards. Calder and Eckhoff were
the pick of the Black pack.
* :|C *
“Cash Amateur”: Though the Maoriland-
ers have never cut much ice in Rugby
League football, the credit must be given
them for establishing the professional code
in Australasia. A. 11. Baskerville took a
side to the North of England in 1907 to
play the Northern Union clubs. The team
included several of the Rugby Union original
All Blacks, and in Sydney Dally Mes-
senger, then at the height of his form, was
added to their ranks. As a result of the
visit the N.S.W. League was formed, and,
greatly strengthened later by an extensive
purchase of Rugby Union “Wallaby” players
on their return from England, it proceeded to
flourish like the green bay-tree of Holy Writ.
(Continued on next page.)
.Australia scored its solitary success at
Wimbledon’ when Jack Crawford, assisted by
Elizabeth Ryan, who is considered the best
mixed-doubles partner playing, won the final
of the shandygaff event. Tilden and Allison
fought out the final of the singles, Big Bill
outing his countryman 6-3, 9-7, 6-4.
* * *
The Australians rested Woodfull, Brad-
man, Oldfield and Grimmett in the match
against Notts at Trent Bridge, and did quite
well to make 296 against Larwood and the
much-advertised fast lefthander Yocc. Both
came off with 3 for 59 and 4 for 80 respec-
tively, Ponsford again falling a victim to
Larwood. Ivippax played a delightful shot
for 93, while McCabe (58) and Richardson
(55) belted both the fast bowlers cheerfully.
Jackson and a’Beckett both got past the 20
mark, but the last four wickets went cheaply.
TWO JOYS AND A MORAL.
[FOR THR BULLETIN.]
The time’s out of joint and we’re due for
confessing
Our follies and failures, our blunders
abysmal. ’
Drought, debt and taxation are subjects
depressing;
All things are conspiring to make a man
dismal;
But a rift in the clouds serves to brighten
each sad man,
A magic wand does it—the bat of one
Bradman.
The stern-visagcd banker, the creditors meet-
ing,
Widespread unemployment, few buyers,
low prices,
We grow to regard as afflictions, yet fleet-
ing,
And heed not the croaking of “national
crisis”
While the gods fill our cup full of joy—
: yea, and brim it!
As wickets are scattered by wonderful
Grimmett.
O, Scullins and Pages, Hills, Hogans and
Bavins!
O, rail and tram bosses, Clapp, Goodman
and Cleary!
With a highwayman’s eye on our uttermost-
savin’s,
Your dead-ended problems serve only to
weary.
When charges 'and deficits bound beyond
limits
We would you were, a<U of you, Bradmans
and Grimmetts !
The moral’s for all you, the selfish and
reckless,
You spoilt ones demanding soft down for
your pillow,
And you the despondent, dispirited, reckless.
No' hope is too high if one swings willing-
willow,
No cause lost, in spite of mistakes, luck and
weather,
With brains and hand steadily pushing the
leather.

“Fitzcray” : It isn’t only at the hands of
playing opponents that the Victorian foot-
baller sustains casualties (B. 25/6/’3O).
Some of the clubs are at their wits’ end to
deliver their darlings from the power of the
barracker. In the less cultured areas of
Melbourne, wire-netted tunnels through
which players may retreat in comparative
safety have long been in vogue, but it has
always been felt that the more aristocratic
tone of the Melbourne C. G. did not call for
anything of the kind. However, one club
which recently encountered Melbourne on the
famous arena has been moved to protest
bitterly against the risks run there by its
players, and has called on Melbourne to
provide for the safety of visiting teams.
Ironically enough' the complainant was Col-
lingwood, a suburb whose forthright bar-
rackers are renowned from Broome to
Bundaberg.
* * # *
“Hotham”: There has been some dirty
work at the Nar-Nar-Goon (Vic.) crossroads.
One Seanlan, an eminent footballer of that
rural retreat, was greatly desired by the
metropolitan clubs of Footscray and St.
Kilda, and has been coquetting with both.
The president of the Footscray club thought
to clinch the matter by running down to
interview the rustic hero one Sunday. After
waiting patiently until the young gentleman
had attended church, he left the necessary
papers to be filled in and forwarded. These
duly arrived but still in a virgin condition,
and a few hours later St. Kilda lodged a
set of completed documents for registration.
At the height of the consequent tumult and
shouting, Richmond stepped in with the
notification that, as the bone of contention
had played with Richmond the previous
season, it had the best right to him under
the rules. The battle is still raging.
i\i sjc ❖
“Sprint”: The speed of .Tim Carlton and
Crossman on the N.S.W. Rugby Union side’s
wings has aroused a good deal of controversy
as to the fastest man who has worn the
light blue jersey. To:l Martineer, Frank
Surman—both professional peds.—Wally
Macpherson, Slip Carr, Nigel Barker, and one
or two others of the more modern school have
each been cited as the real pea. The writer
plumps for Nigel Barker, whose records for
the N.S.W. 220 and 440 and the Australasian
440 have stood for five-and-twenty years.
Carlton runs him close, but Barker was the
robuster. in physique, though not a whit more
determined than the ex-St. Joseph’s boy, who
lias all the attributes of a Rugby player to
add to his great pace.
❖ % s*s :{:
“Her Jong”: The South African Rugby
Board has confirmed its invitation to Aus-
tralia to visit , r the Union in 1933. No Aus-
tralian side save the A.I.F. combination has
aver figured in Afrikanderdom, and that team
played only one match, against Natal, at
Durban, winning 34-3. The 1921 Springboks
on their tour of Australia played only Vic-
toria and N.S.W., so it is impossible to com-
pare the respective form of the two countries.
Taking recent showings of ’Boks and Aus-
tralians against the All Blacks, there should
be no reason to fear the ’Boks.
* * * *
“Stand Off”: The N.S.W. Rugby Union
doesn’t believe in letting has-beens be has-
beens, and proposes to dig up a team of the
original Waratahs to play the Rest of Aus-
tralia in a trial match in Sydney prior to
selecting the Australian side to meet the
British team in August. Quite a lot of the
famous side have dropped out, and others
are dropping themselves —I saw one of the
greatest of them in the street the other day
who must have measured some 15ft. round
the equator. In N.S.W. alone the young
entry is so brilliant this season that few of
the renowned tourists would seem to have
much chance of catching another Australian
cap. Still, the match should draw well, for
many will grasp the chance of having a
last look ait the final .kick of their old
favorites.
* * * *
“Gate”: Stung to exasperation by the
manner in which country clubs who have
secured the services of players on contract
have declined to release these for inter-State
games, the N.S.W. Rugby League has re-
solved that all future contracts of the kind
shall be illegal from its point of view. It
is a praiseworthy endeavor to maintain fast
waning discipline, but it will bo difficult to
enforce compliance. Already some of the
offending clubs have told the State body to
go to Gehenna, and it is painfully evident
that they find every satisfaction in matches
between themselves for heavy side wagers
without bothering about the alleged honor
and glory of inter-State representation.
The Fifteen
Woodfnil’s Wanderers scored a meritori-
ous win in the second Test at Lord’s, com-
ing out on ,top by seven wickets in a match
in which the luck cut even for both sides.
Resuming on the third day, with the score
at 404 for 2 wickets, the tourists hoisted
729 for 6 wickets before Woodfull declared.
The total is the highest recorded in a Test,
and Don Bradman, who finished his magni-
ficent shot at 254 without giving a chance,
broke all individual precedents, save R. E.
Foster’s 287 at Sydney in 1904. Kippax
was at his best in gathering 83, while
McCabe (44), Richardson (30) and Old-
field (43) all attacked the tired bowling
successfully. White’s 3 for 158 was easily
England’s best bowling performance. Eng-
land began Avith a collapse in the second
innings; the first five wickets went for 147,
Hobbs, Woolley, Hammond and Ilendren
being dismissed cheaply. Duleepsinhji
batted pluckily for 48, and ihen Chapman
came to the rescue with a splendid fighting-
knock of 12.1, marred only by a chance before
he had scored. Allen made amends for his
bowling failure by helping his skipper with
a lively 57, and the innings closed at 875.
Grimmett again got among the wickets Avith
6 for IG7, while the reliable Fairfax also
collected a couple. With 72 to win, Aus-
tralia lost Ponsford, Bradman and Kippax
for 22 runs. Woodfull kept plugging along
steadily, and with McCabe’s help quietly
gathered the balance required, their scores
being 2(5 and 25 n.o. respectively.
* * * *
Yorkshire made an even poorer showing
against the Australians at Bradford than
it did in the first match at Bramall-
lane. The Australians, listless from Lord’s
the previous day, batted unattractively for
302, Woodfull and Bradman both failing.
Ponsford played his best innings to date for
143, while McCabe (40), a’Beckett (30
n. 0.) and Jackson (46) helped, though
Jackson’s form was unconvincing. Veteran
Wilfred Rhodes took Yorkshire bowling-
honors with 3 for 59. Grimmett. got 0
wickets in the Tykes’ first knock, which
ended at 146, Rhodes again starring with
top score of 35. Following on the home
side tallied 161, W. Barber topping Avith
42. Grimmett took 5 for 58 this time, but
Hurwood’s 4 for 35 gave his mates eA T en
greater satisfaction. Australia hit off the
7 runs to win Avithout loss.
* * * * •
“Lansdowne”: There were some remark-
able points about the composition of the
English eleven for the second Test. For
one thing it contained five amateurs. I sus-
pect one would haA-e to go back a long way
to find, so many in an international side.
What is even stranger, there was only a
single North of England man (DuckAvorth)
to ten Southerners, Yorkshire and Notts
being both unrepresented. Whether the
selectors being all Southerners had anvthing
to do with this is matter for conjecture, but
I forecast there will he vociferous demands
(as in 1921) for selectors’ heads on chargers
unless some better boAvlers are dug up for
the next encounter.
■'Bramall Lane”: Writer’s opinion (B.
5/2/'80) that “on present indications our
bowling (for the English tour) is likely to
be much better than Avas imagined possible
at the beginning of the season” was as the
voice of one crying in the wilderness to the
accompaniment of a khamsin of pessimism in
this respect, emanating from Australian and
English experts alike. The forecast was
made'in commenting on Lord HaAyke’s bluff
statement that he hoped the visiting bowling
would bo better than the stuff available in
England, To the end of the second York-
shire match, our once-despised bowling has
been the deciding factor in most of the
matches. The counties have one and all
failed against it, while in the first Test
England could score only 270'and 302. In
the second a single batsman in each innings,
Duleepsinhji and Chapman, saved the home
side from rout. Apart from Grimmett and
H’ornibrook, Fairfax, Wall and McCabe have
been consistently picking up good wickets,
AA r liile, a’Beckett and Hunvood are at last
coming into the picture.
# * jjj
“Ibn el Issar”: When .the question of
Duleepsinhji’s inclusion in an English
eleven was being discussed, some misguided
enthusiasts urged that it would go a long
way to .soothe the ill-feeling in India. Noav,
following the announcement of the Hindu
Gymkhana, the most influential native sports
organisation in India, that it intends to
boycott, not only the annual quadrangular
cricket tourney in Bombay, but the proposed
tour of a Marylebone C. 0. team, the historic
club lias resolved to cancel its tour. The
quadrangular show is a unique affair in
which teams from Europeans. Parsec, Mos-
lems and Hindus take part, and is the star
turn of the Indian season.
Racquet and Brawl
“Centre Court’’: Wilmer Allison, who
knocked Moon out of the Wimbledon singles
(B. 25/6/’3O), is Jiy no means a second-
rater, though he ranks No. 7 on the American
singles list. He is a fine, doubles player,
and with Van ’ Ryu beat the Frenchmen in
the challenge round of the last Davis Cup.
He has victories over F. T. Hunter to his
credit, and this year won the London singles
championships at Queens. At this Wimble-
don meeting he lias capped all his previous
performances by beating the mighty Cochet
in the hollowest fashion.
* * • * *
“Rev. Knucklebone”: The recent meeting
of the International Tennis Federation in
Paris settled the question of permitting
amateurs and professionals to meet occa-
sionally in open tournaments, the proposal,
fathered by England, being turned down
with emphasis. There were some curious
decisions on amateurism. An amateur may
receive a present of tennis goods from a
sporting-goods firm and remain unsullied
unless he sells them, when he automatically
becomes black. Also, if he deals in tennis
requisites he may not advertise his goods
in any tourney in which he is playing. If
lie is not playing, he can advertise to the
limit, and not suffer. There are quite a lot
of Australian players who would he well
advised to drop active tennis and take up
the advertising side.
* * * *
“Pit-a-pat”: The latest development of the
tennis obsession is “Padder.” It can be
played in any decently sized hall, and offers
a good opportunity for practice in wet
weather. The court is 39ft. x 18ft., and the
net 2ft. 3in. high. Racquets are made of
wood and the balls of sponge rubber. The
game can he played out of doors where
there is not sufficient room for a full-size
court, and is said to lend itself as well to
the development of the tennis temperament
as the parent pastime.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Divot, Digger”: Once more Australia is
being threatened with an invasion of British
golfers. J. W. Trumble, of Melbourne, and
P. W. Pope, of Sydney, who are following
the Australian Eleven round England, have
had an indaba with the committee of St.
Andrews regarding the visit of an amateur
British side to Australia. The same two
enthusiasts, with Nettlefold pere of Tassy,
tried to arrange something of the sort a
couple of years ago. Matters progressed so
far that the British team was named, but
at the last moment all found they had urgent
engagements elsewhere. However, the fact,
that Walter Hagen managed to escape from
this country without being eaten by the can-
nibals of Woolloomooloo has been well adver-
tised ; so perhaps the Britons will this time
take their courage in both hands and chance
it
“S.T.S.”: Leg'll Winser, who has been
private secretary to half a dozen S.A. Gov-
ernors in turn, has won the Adelaide Golf
Club championship again, and more easily
than usual. With four consistent rounds,
75 the best, he totalled 807. Lemann, a
comparatively newcomer, was a bad second
with 320. In the Dunlop Cup for profes-
sionals, Rufus Stewart. Australian cham-
pion, beat Fergus McMahon, S.A. champion,
by 6 and 4, but unexpectedly lost to Harvey
at the 36th, after fine play by both in the
final.
“Hamilton” : It is not often that the pro-
fessional sportsman breaks into the ranks of
sporting journalism, if we except, some of
the cricket inkslingers. A recent exception
is J. R. Quarton, Queensland’s professional
champion, who will in future run the golf
column in the Brisbane “Courier.” A fine
player, who began the game in Britain and
carried on in Maoriland before coming to
Australia, he has already achieved some fame
as a lecturer on the pastime which stands
only second to whisky in the Scotsman’s
estimation. Like many others of his frater-
nity in Queensland he saw service in the
Great War, and he represented M.L. in the
inter-Allied championship match played in
London after the Armistice.
❖ , :|:
“Hothain” : Victorian golferettes will hop
over in their twentieth championship meet-
ing on July 22. on the Kingston Heath
course. The battle will be decided by match
play only, and playerinas from all States
are eligible—the more the merrier. In addi-
tion there will be handicap singles and four-
somes events as well as a stroke handicap
in two divisions.
“Brnssey” : Australian professional golfers
certainly do not “rowl i’ riches” like their
American brethren (B. 25/6/’3O), but things
are looking up. The Professional Golfers’
Association has been instrumental in having-
one or two decent money prizes set up for
competition. Now the Dunlop-Perdriau
rubber people have hopped in with their
share in the shape of a £lOO purse to be
added to the annual silver cup. There will
be a qualifying tourney of 36 holes stroke
play on the Australian club’s course at
Kcnso on July 30, and the 16 with the best
cards will play off for the simoleons and
the pot.
Car and Cycle
“Fernie”: Norman Smith’s speed exploit
on the Ninety-mile Beach, up near the top
end of M.L., has inflamed the civic patriotism
of Aucklanders, who claim the beach lias a
better and much longer surface than the one
at Daytona. Smith told them that if the
course had been, flagged and timekeepers
posted he could have continued after his
10-milc spurt and. broken the 50-kilometre
record. However that may be, Malcolm
Campbell has asked for full information
about the stretch of sand, and the measuring
and staking of the course and the installa-
tion of an electric timing device are being
taken in hand.
=l= * * *
“Whizz”: Dirt-track motor-cycle racing
has proved more popular in Britain than
ever this season, and Australian riders, who
were largely responsible for its introduction
to Albion, still continue to annex the
majority of the plums. The first of a series
of international test matches held at Wimble-
done was won by the Australian team, which
took seven of the nine heats, by 35 points to
17. Victor ITuxley, of Queensland, won
three heats, and others to score were Gross-
kreutz, another Bananalander, Frank Arthur
and Billy Lamont, of N.S.W.
* * * *
“Kick Starter”: Stuart Williams, the
Australian representative in the Isle of Man
Tourist Trophy races for motor-cyclists, did
not have the best of luck. In the light-
weight and junior events machine troubles
put an end to any chance he might have
had. He had little opportunity to get in
the necessary practice on the tricky course
for the senior race, since the machine he
was to ride could not be delivered until the.
last moment. This points to careless organi-
sation. It seems hardly worth while to send
a rider so far at considerable, expense and
then to jeopardise his prospects of success by
failing to ensure that he is properly equipped.
Miscellaneous
"Bide Off” : The Ashton brothers, of Goul-
burn (N.5.,W.), gave Australian polo a great
advertisement by playing themselves into
the final of the famous Champion Cup at
Hurlingham. They were beaten 9-7 by tire
Hurricanes, acknowledged the strongest club
in England, but made such a. fine showing
that they rode off the ground in a wave of
enthusiasm rarely seen at the very swish
resort. The King of Spain, a keen player
himself, is presenting the' team with a special
cup to mark its great showing, and one of
the brothers, “G.G.,” has been asked to
play for The Rest against the England
team which is to meet the Americans at
Westchester in August—an unprecedented
honor for an overseas player.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: Arne Borg hats at last
been declared a professional. He is
going into partnership with Johnny Weiss-
muller, another amateur who made ' a
fat living out of the game for years. The
interesting thing about these folk is then*
ability to make long and expensive tours
abroad, though they admittedly have no pri-
vate incomes and are allowed only a few
shillings a day for expenses. Not less
interesting is the solid pretence of amateur-
ism maintained by sporting organisations
which find the funds for these Visits and
pocket big profits therefrom.
“Susie Swattit”: The Australian hockey
flappers kicked off successfully in South
Africa the other day, when tliey beat the
East London lasses in their opening match,
2-1. In the first round of the international
championship they had to take the knock.
Scotland boating them 4-3. However, the
championship will be decided on a points
basis, all the teams meeting each other in
turn, so there is hope for our girls yet.
jjc jJc : ! ; jJc
“The Gaffer”: A fast track or a slow
watch must have had a part in the new
world’s record for the 100 metres put up
in TJ.S.A. by Eddie Tolan, who was clocked
at 10 l-s.sec. This works out at about eight
yards better than evens, which is warmish
work, and knocks a fifth of a second off
Charles Paddock’s figures, which have been
standing since 1921. Canadian Percy Wil-
liams, who won the event at the last. Olym-
piad in 10 3-ssec., could only get third place
to Tolan.
“Long Rest”: That proposal to close up a
billiard break as soon as the opponent’s ball
is potted (B. 25/6/’.30) is meeting with
a very cool reception from many of the lead-
ing professionals. Most of these are safety-
first exponents who fully appreciate the
blessings of being able to sink an opponent
when there is little prospect of further scor-
ing, and then leave him a double baulk. Clark
McConachy, who is much addicted to this
form of billiards strategy, is strong in his
opposition. The public generally would wel-
come the change, for the persistent safety
player is a weariness to the flesh.

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
Have you
ordered
Kruft Cheese?
This Letter got out to the Sheep Show
a bit early last week, so filled in time by lean-
ing over their pens and communing with
King Albert and Bert Hinkler, who were,
mate-ily enough, side by side. Neither
thought much of the crowd. Bert said so by
turning a wide and expressive stern to the
procession passing his door, but King Albert
faced the humans with the tolerant smile of
the aristocrat viewing the rabble. He flicked
the end of the straw he was nibbling in a
blase manner towards a bunch of the squat-
tocracy coming towards him. “Look at their
coats,” he muttered to Frith, who had come
with us to get some impressions (you’ll find
them scattered all over this page)—“look
at them, worn any old way, cut of the
year 1901! Why should I and my
brethren —Don Bradman over there, for
instance —be divested of our coats that the
world may be filled with such coats as that?”
Suddenly his peevishness vanished, and a
vibration like a burst of jazz ran cork-
screwing down his horns. “Here,” he said,
“is a bird of a different color.” A nice gild
in russet-brown tweeds paused before him.
He stood up and did the merino’s equivalent
of pulling down his waistcoat. The girl
went on her way. “There,” he sighed ;' “no
sheep would object to being a Raleigh in that
cause,”
There were three pavilions filled with
Merinos, Corriedales, Romney Marshes, Lin-
colns, English Leicesters and Leicesters that
were nearly Scotch, being of the Border
family. There were Southdowns and Dorset
Horns, and there was more diversity in their
faces than there is in the faces of homo
sapiens. The pens were softly packed with
clean straw for this sweetest smelling of
animals, and, when not simply denying the
existence of the gazing grazier and judges by
turning their backs and digging their pink
noses into the backs of the pens, the sheep
dozed, or browsed in the feed-boxes with an
air of unutterable boredom. Here and there
a heavily-endowed creature trembled as with
an ague under the weight of his riches —or
was it the fear that he might not escape the
eye of the tax-collector?
One pavilion was like a boudoir, -whose
inhabitants are about to enter or are just
emerging from a bath. Each one still wore
its blanket dressing-grown, not to be dis-
carded till the approach of the judges. These
gentlemen were busy in another pavilion
dragging asunder the wool of the sheiks of
the pens, and peering into it in the most
impertinent manner—much as an anxious
mother might ransack the head of an uneasy
offspring. This proved of absorbing interest
to men in tweed suits belted or unbelted
according to their embonpoints, to middle-age
in shabby overcoats nearly ankle-length, to
glossy middle-age in coats just as long but
brand new, to two genuine Steele Rudd
Dads, whiskers and all. If you stood on a
bench you could watch the attendants in
tan overalls hanging on to the horns of the
“Confound your impudence!”
rams, that stood like monuments. The
thought struck you how terrible it would
have been if the out-of-work musicians had
got a job as holders. Some of them, lulled
into half-consciousness by the inactivity,
would surely have thought those curly horns
trombones and double basses, and in a sudden
frenzy have tried to make an orchestra out
of them.
Frankly speaking, the attendance was very
poor as to numbers, and, with the exception
of a few richly furred women, quite careless
of its frocking. Yet the sheep were wearing
their best outfit in years.
Now, why shouldn’t the Sheep Show be to
Sydney what the Horse Show is to Dublin?
The sheep is our wealth—according to its
fleece are we affluent or bankrupt—and
instead of this Show drawing its few hun-
dreds a day it should draw its thousands.
Polo should be a side-show to the sheep sales.
The R.A.S. and the sheepbreeders ought to
combine and make it an occasion. The first
day should feature an open-air reception.
Women should come in their finest array,
there should be bands and vice-regals and
gaily decorated stands. After all, a sheep
show is of more national value than a bull
fight, and look at the festa Spain makes out
of that!
The pastel-tinted stocking is back in New
York by day as well as by night, but only
for formal occasions in the afternoon. The
point is that so little of the stocking shows
beneath the ankle-length hemlines of formal
gowns that a fastidious detail is to have the
few inches a continuation of the gown color.
Suede shoes to tone are the only wear.
Somebody has at last thought of the short
of log, and put on the market a “little-girl”
hose. These are three inches shorter than
the average, thus eliminating the rolling and
folding and the constant tightening of sus-
penders which the smaller woman who likes
her stockings taut lias suffered for so long.
The black-and-white vogue in which Paris
and New York a*re rioting has developed
another accessory. Smart young things now
cannot exist without a black pearl ring
for the left hand and a white pearl for the
right.
A mid-summer dream of a hat was seen
in the rain of last week. It was created (no
coarser word will do) of sheer black Malines
braid, its wide bands joined in circular tiers.
Underneath there was a crown foundation
of the same hair, overlaid with pale pink
narcissus. The flowers shimmering between
the fine meshes of hair were delicious. Around
the crown ran a narrow moire ribbon,
fastened into a bow with a narcissus bud,
thence drooping over the back of the flowing
brim. Another hat which will be copied
and bowdlerised was a<n exquisite thing which
the Girl in the Flat Opposite says is almost
an exact replica of the one seen in the por-
trait of the Empress Eugenie by Winter-
halter. It has, she declares, tlie same shallow
crown, drooping brim, very wide at both
sides and folded at the right. Instead of
the old-fashioned leghorn in the picture, this
1930 hat was in pale pink ballibuntal. A
soft scarf of pale pink and dull chartreuse
chiffon is wound twice about the crown, and
a cluster of pale pink roses droops from the
right side, down to the wearer’s shoulder.
But the trouble about wearing a hat like
that would be that the only address you’d
dare give the taxi-man is Government House.
And if you want to lead the procession,
you will have- your evening wrap of (he old-
fashioned damask brocade of the eighteenth
century. These brocades are said to be repro-
ductions of museum pieces, only the modern
version is not hand-woven, a.nd is more supple,
And you can’t skimp on tlie matei*ial either.
The formal evening wrap is flowing and
often reaches the skirt hemline at the back.
Polo has seen better days. This year's
fixtures were a washout. Polo weather is
notoriously bad, and as many of the best
players are either out of the country or
tied very tight to it by hard times, the play
was anything but brilliant. The attendance
was affected by the same circumstances;
never had Kensington been so sparsely popu-
lated. At three o’clock on the second after-
noon of the Dudley Cup, ringside seats
stretched bleak and unoccupied. G.-G. Stone-
haven and liis lady put in an appearance
every day, and the State vice-regals were
there on the opening day to cheer the Assa-
manders and the Wurrigullas ; but the skies
were grey, the rain fell, the air was chill,
the buntinged stand looked as gay as a
bathing-machine on one of England’s moral
strands, and the tea tent pitched for Kari-
tane struck one as about as paying a con-
cern as the railways. Of this tent Mrs. Ken
Austin was in charge; her husband, who is
secretary of the association, looked debonair
in spite of everything, or because of it. One
wondered if he had a secret rainbow round
his shoulders.
The Vicereines showed a nice taste in
coats. Black Persian lamb with Arctic fox
collar and cuffs was worn by Lady Stone-
haven, and Lady Game wore the broadtail
coat in which she greeted Sydney. Miss
Crowdy was cosily grey and black. June
Baillien, very smart in green, from Mel-
bourne, came with Betty Willsallen, who was
brownly furred. Mrs. G. Waller, whose hus-
band captained tlie Wirrigullas, was smart
in black. Bonnie Smith (Paterson), whose
young man, Dr. J. C. Bell Allen, plays for
Sydney, ari-ived one day in riding-kit, but
really waders would have been more in the*
picture. Elsewhere second-best furs, tweed
top-coats, berets, tight little hats, rugs and
rubber boots represented fashion’s high-water
mark.
The Extra Chukka Ball filled the Blax-
laerd Galleries, and even at the reduced price
of 12s. 6d. a ticket the result should be a
good cheque for the harborside branch of
the C.W.A.; nearly a thousand crowded into
the rooms. The G.-G. Stoneliavens and the
State Exes, had been bagged, and were
impressively received by Mrs. Matt Sawyer
and Mrs. Colin Venn, both in black lit with
diamonds and diamente. From Lady Stone-
haven’s black georgettes flowed a short cape;
and Lady Game wore black velvets on which
gold poppy-heads were embossed. The
Galleries, picked out in pale gold and royal
blue lights, with polished parquet floor, were
a decoration in themselves. In addition, there
were balloons a*nd streamers in the teams’
colors, but no polo songs desecrated the
pillared halls, and country people were
noticeably few.
Treasurer Mrs. Din Garvan featured
black lace; and in an assemblage where black
predominated secretary Nora Grainger’s
amber satins were as heartening as a beaded
lager on a December day. Audrey Maple
Brown’s smooth dark head arose from well-
cut white satin. Betty Cra<ig (Cooma) was
Frenchily blue and pink. Judith Osborne,
in sky-blue laces, cheerfully suggested fine
weather ahead. Among the seven debs, were
Joyce Beazley and Nancy Christian, straight
from the schoolroom of Doone, and Principal
Jean Cheriton kept an eye on them during
their transit under the wing of Mrs. Colin
Venn. The brand-new Mrs. John Collins
(she was Phyl MacLaclilan), Naomi Waters,
Mrs. C. L. Jones and Morna MacCormick
were others who blended good looks and good
clothes happily.
The cocktail party that followed Peggy
Howse’s wedding was the only big frivol to
fill the yawn between Polo and the night.
Between 50 and 00 of the brightest went
along to the Queen’s Club to welcome Peggy
when she stepped into their midst as Mrs.
George Voelcker. The knot that bound her
to Lieut. George Voelcker, R.N., had been
tied by Padre Hugh Paton within St.
Stephen’s just around the corner. Peggy is
tlie daughter of the late Dr. Oswald Ilowse,
of Cootamundra, and her sailor’s father
hangs out his sign in Harley-street. A pale
gold velvet frock, a coat of soft moleskin
and a spray of orchids sustained the bride.
Mrs. Neil Kilby and Joyce Howse were in
the procession. Bride’s mother was a nice
Longstaff composition in black velvet, silver
fox and violets.
What gorgeous silks are flaunted in “The
Jealous Wife,” Allan Wilkie’s opening show
at the Opera House ! The brocades in which
Miss Hunter-Watts bounces and bridles
through the fii\st act are the most delicious
primrose-green and yellows this writer has
ever seen—all spring is in that dress. Lady
Freelove makes her appearance in a sky-
after-rain blue broche from which flows a
train of peacock-blue velvet edged with gold
tassels. There”s a bad young man in a
moss-green coat with those nutty _ little
•shoulder capes, and Allan Wilkie himself,
as the dashing Major, first in white breeches
and a white-and-pink coat coupled with
amazing white gauntlet gloves and a pair
of almost thigh-high black boots, and then
in a cloak of the most ravishing blue.
After the opening show the company held
a levee on the stage, and received the guests
in their last-act costumes and make-up. This
last was quite fearsome in the case of Cap-
tain O’iCutter, who was mostly purple and
yellow. The orchestra played, the curtain
was drawn up so that the company might
gaze out on the auditorium and feel they,
too, were walking the boards. Coffee was
served hot, and cars were called about 11.45.
The out-of-work musician is attracted.
“To get the poor dog a bone,” between
six and seven hundred turned up at the
Wentworth to dance last week on a night
lit by a new moon. The R.S.P.C.A. sends
out a wide appeal, and animal-lovers scratch
up the last of the Christmas-pudding thrip-
pennies to pay for the ball tickets. It is
worth an N. 8., though, that a committee,
with Mrs. Warwick Fairfax for its president
and bristling with society names, should
decide that this year ball tickets must bo
reduced to 10s. 6d. Two of the doggiest
things in the room were Warwick Fairfax
(by reason of his clothes) and David
O’Kane. David is a prize black retriever
who goes every year to the ball and spoils
the Egyptian on behalf of his brethren. In
pennies David collected over £4. Warwick
Fairfax, in marvellous, tailorings, danced
through the night with but the shadow of
a smile. He treated his partners with the
decorum to be expected from one whose
days are spent in the company of the “S. M.
Herald.” His wife was her usual pretty
self, in sapphire-blue chiffons made with long
sleeves. She and Warwick received the Vice-
regal Games, who, with Lieut.-Commandcr
Gifford and Miss Crowdy, sat On a dais
surrounded by pelicans engaged in juggling
with the alphabet—they had so far picked
out R.S.P.C.A.
Mrs. Bavin and Nancy were among the
dancers. Mrs. Michael King was there, in
elongated green chiffons. Mary Jones was
in honey-colored lace, land Molly Street
looked like a pretty brown moth flashing
in bronze and gold in the bright lights. Lady
Game’s frock was beauty in parchment chif-
fon, blooming in pink and white embossed
chenille roses. Mrs. C. L. Jones was a
notable frocker; so were slim Mary Brigham,
in niglit-sky blue; Daisy Clayton, in black
and white; and a tall, young stranger,
swathed in black chiffons worn with long,
black suede gloves piped from shoulder to
wrist in scarlet.
This year the Americans in Sydney split
forces in the celebration of the Glorious
Fourth: while the American Society and
the Women’s Circle were making merry
within David Jones’s spacious halls, many
others for old times’ sake foregathered at
the Wentworth. When the first American
Fourth of July dinner was held at the Went-
worth 29 men drank the toasts. Volstead
hadn’t been heal'd of then, and even Uncle
Sam’s direct representative didn’t hesitate
to name his poison. Last week the hotel on
Church Hill still wore its stars and stripes
gaily. Every table was lit with the glory of
poinsettia, and America’s airs clashed and
clattered throughout a dinner that was Ameri-
can in its make-up. At David Jones’s the
party resolved itself into a reception for
new Consul-General Tredwell and his good-
looking lady—she emerging triumphant from
the assembled gaze in pastel-toned moires
sown with silver sequins.
Bridge wedded to jazz at Cranbrook was
one of the week’s answers to the problem:
What shall we do with ourselves and our
country visitors —if any ? Other time-
absorbers were the Justice Harveys’ party
for daughter Mary, the Rose Bay dance, the
Allan Wilkie reception (after “The Jealous
Wife” on Saturday) and Mrs. Walter Swin-
son’s Sunday-afternoon party. At this last
the long, high music-room of The Cottage
was filled with people from town and country.
On the big Dutch-looking fireplace, with ...its
shining white and blue tiles, a fire blazed,
electric light and candles lit the room, while
through the open doors and windows could
be seen fingers of sunlight scampering across
an emerald-green lawn. Lionel Lawson’s
violin poured out its richness, Mrs. Horace
Shelter sang Brahms and Debussy, and Mrs.
Swinson, very graceful in her black frock
with its flowing line, poured out Rach-
maninoff and the tenderest of Schubert that
lay waiting within the Concert Grand. All
the “Berkeley Square” people were there,
Ann Gordon and Margaret Fairfax bloom-
ing like roses under tight little blue bonnets.
It was the most man-full party this Letter
has been to for mouths, and Mr. Swinson
and son Ryder had no end of assistants when
tea-time arrived.
Joyce Meares, tall and slim, carried her
Patou pink and silver moirfe wedding-gown
with the air of distinction it required. All
the prisms seemed caught in the rhinestone
clasp which defined the high waist of the
semi-princess bodice. The sleeves were long
and tight, and tile classically-draped skirt
fell from an absolutely moulded hip line in
graceful folds to the ground. Old lace and
billows of Patou-pink tulle formed the train,
and the orange blossom was pink in the same
delicate shade. Three golden girls followed
the bride, who met her ’groom, Captain C. A.
Osborne, of Duntroon, at St. Mark’s, Dar-
ling Point, and afterwards received con-
gratulations at the home of • her parents,
the R. G. Meareses, of Bellevue Hill. Mrs.
Meares wore one of those Very new hair
hats. It was in blue and woven into a lace
design, and was worn with an ensemble in
Paquin-blue lace. Captain and Mrs. Osborne
will spend six months in Canberra, and in
the New Year will leave for his staff job
in India.
The late Mrs. H. Hudson, of Hillsborough,
West. Maitland’s, best-known amateur gar-
dener, a lady of pleasing personality and
some literary gifts, was related on the
maternal side to Robert Louis Stevenson..
Her father was the late Dr. G. M. Lee, of
Bristol; his grandfather had been surgeon
to the King; and a forebear in the Royal
Navy was the officer who took Napoleon into
exile.
Tulips and lilac were all abloom for Jo
O’Keeffe when she went down to Esher to
week-end with Eugenia Doughty, who was
Eugenia Stone, The Bulletin’s Melbourne
lady before she married her English knight.
Eugenia is installed in River House, which
same has nine miles of water front. In a
walk through the Park on a fine Sunday, the
Sydneyite met nine people she knew, includ-
ing Mrs. Tom Rolin and Edith Manning
and her mother, the latter pair just back
from Rome; the Lionel Bridge family, about
to emba<rk for Norway; David Jones’s Mr.
and Mrs. Edwards'and daughter Joan, who
were setting their sail towards .Port Jack-
son. Margaret Baxter, a chieftainess of the
Forum Club, who had been lecturing in
Canada, Washington and New Y.oi'k on
women’s clubs, arranged a lunch party at
Hyde Park Hotel for her old friend. The
George Tallis lady and Mrs. Frank Otter
(remembered as a handsome frocker in
Sydney and Melbourne) were other Aus-
tralians with whom Miss O’Keeffe fore-
gathered. The Tallis flat is close to Park
Lane Hotel, and Mrs. Otter’s address is
Grosvenor House, Park Lane. Mrs. Norman
Gadsden, of Melbourne, was at some of the
parties. She is working hard with Plunkett
Green, who has high hopes for her singing
career.
Struan Ivemmis, of Killara, is another of
the newly-engaged. Her about.-to-be better
or worse is Harry Crossing, of Quirindi.
St. Mark’s at Darling Point was cheered
in a glum, grey week by a gleam of beauty
when Cecilia Sliakerley, of Worcestershire,
Sir Walter Raleigh.
presented herself —view mat. The sweeping
satin train of her mediaeval frock gleamed
through a foam of tulle. A coronet of orange
buds riveted the veil to the head; orchids
and lily of the valley kept company in .hex-
bouquet, and Mary Wormald and Betliia
Anderson, a flame of burnt orange velvet, ate
UP the carpet behind the bride. Captain Hol-
brook, of H.M.A.S. Canberra, armed the lady
to the altar, where Lieut.-Commander E. R.
Leighton, R.N., of Bishops Stormford
(Eng.), claimed her per favor of Badre
Terence Naughton. Later the Wormald
.home, Inishowen, Woollahra, housed the
wedding guest and his garment, and there
Mrs. Shakerley’s outfit of white ring velvet
collared in black fox came in for its meed
of praise. The Lt.-. Commander, who has
been lent to the Australian Navy, will return
to England with Mrs. Leighton in October.
At a recent ball, to which society, ancient
and modern, turned up in the newest styles,
Mrs. Grundy remarked with approval: “How
nice to see the girls with their legs covered
—so modest!” Modest! A look around the
ballroom brought a blush to the post-war
girl’s cheek. Never in her time had woman
exhibited her contour so generously. A
woman whose skirts flowed to the ground had
a backless bodice which necessitated her
partner getting a catch-as-catch-can grip of
a chubby shoulder-blade. A woman near
by had a bodice cut in front to the danger
zone, and women all over the place had
poured themselves into those silhouette frocks
that fit the wearer like the mould fits the
jelly. Impossible to wear any but the flim-
siest atrd closest fitting under-garment below
these, and the result is a strident insistence
on contour. But. Madame, the legs are
covered ; modesty lives once more ! Victoria
herself might smile upon the fashions, up-
stairs particularly; they are reminiscent of
the best hypocrisies of ber time.

The first day of the Grand National
Steeplechase meeting at Flemington was
made pleasant by a touch of spring in the
air, and the crowd was large. Dressing
was almost entirely in winter modes, and
most women wore coats —fur, tweed or cloth.
There were many tailored suits of tweed.
A few optimists came out in ensemble cos-
tumes of lightweight material, and here
and there a flowered chiffon gown could be
glimpsed beneath a wrap. An old fashion
revived is the attachment of a cape to top-
coat or one-piece gown, and judging by. the
number of examples seen on the lawn it is
making a lot of headway. Some of the
caped surtouts resembled the highwayman’s
coat of melodrama. Fur coats were numer-
ous and of good quality. Squirrel was
quite common and mink followed hard in
favor. Black, with in some cases a dash of
white, led all other color schemes for frocks
at Flemington, with blue of various shades
next and tweeds a close third. Quite a
number of wearers of black brightened the
effect with a large lapel posy of orchids,
lily-of-the-valley or violets. Fresh flowers
have come into their own again for both day
and evening wear.
There were not a great many country
visitors in the vicinity of the members’
stand. The John Winter-Irvings, of Nagambie,
were there, she coated and hatted in wine
tone ; also Mrs. Tom Laidlaw, of Hamilton ;
Mrs. A. E. Dunne, from Warrnambodl; the
Hunter Pattersons, Mrs. Claude Palmer
(Terang), Winsome Warren, from Adelaide,
and Miss Egan, of Sydney. A returned
exile was Mrs. R. G. Casey, whose black
coat had a cape collar of Persian lamb,
her hat combining felt and straw. Frank
Clarke’s lady was in black, and Mrs. Russell
Clarke’s beautiful broad-tail coat had sable
cuffs and collar. Other wearers of
were Mrs. Edward Manifold, Mrs. Kettle-
well, Mrs. P. Blackbourn and Mrs. Leon
Gordon, the last-named a dainty figure in
coat and skirt of black velvet and tam-o’-
shanter millinery of the same stuff. Mrs.
Douglas Stephens sported a coat-frock with
a coachman’s cape, and there were crystal
flowers on her close-fitting black satin head-
piece. Premier Hogan’s wife was all in
gendarme blue, and Mrs. J. Merrillees wore
a cloth-and-georgette ensemble of nattier hue.
Mrs. Stuart Brunton looked arresting in
attire and hat of bottle green, Mrs. Richard
Linton was wrapped in some wonderful furs
and Mrs. Forbes Mackenzie added a diverse
color note with a burgundy colored suit.
Despite rain and an all-pervading chill,
there was a good roll-up of Oaklands . Hunt
Club followers at the club’s race meeting at
Moonee Valley last week. Most interest
centred in the Club Steeplechase and Ladies’
Bracelet events. The latter item was
omitted from hunt-club race programmes
for some time, but its revival last year
was so successful that . its inclusion seems
assured in future. Moliie McAuley was able
to claim the bauble, the winner, Nenad,
ridden by A. Frawley, having been entered
in her name. The weather made the dress-
ing compulsorily a matter of tweeds and
topcoats, but that didn’t matter much, as
the women who attend hunt-club race gather-
ings w r ear tweed with great eclat. Mrs. W.
H. Magennis, wife of the deputy-master of
the club, was there in an all-black turn-out.
Melbourne last week staged a fog which
began as a matinee and continued right on
till midnight. It was a fearsome business
groping down Collins-street while that fog
held sway. Phantom figures loomed up so
suddenly ‘ from the gloom that pedestrians
collided, and crossing the street was a night-
mare. Turning back their files, our weather
experts discovered that 10 years ago there
was a similar phenomenon, which arrived
during the sojourn here of Edward P., and
perhaps was a patriotic effort on the part
of the Clerk of the Weather, who thought
the Royal visitor might be pining for Lon-
don. The cause of the latest murk can’t
even be guessed at, but it gave us many a
thrill. Trains crept cautiously, their pro-
gress punctuated by the banging of detona-
tors, and no ship left the wharves. Follow-
ing as it did on the heels of a couple .of
spring-like days, the eerie effect of the visi-
tation was enhanced.
Firbank Old Grammarians’ hop at No. 9
was a pink party. Native heath in its varied
hues of rose provided decoration, and debs.
in diaphanous frocks of tourmaline pink
added to the effect. Mrs. lan Macfarlan,
president of the association, offered a charm-
ing contrast in draperies of pale green, and
Joyce Young, the hon. sec., wore chiffon
of wine tint. The headmistress of Firbank,
Miss M. Cameron, came to the dance in
lace and georgette of russet brown. Import-
ance was lent to the occasion by the fact
that the school comes of age this year.
Old students of Toorak College turned
over the profits of their dance last week to
the Benevolent Society. The reunion, which
was staged at the Rex, was a particularly
well-dressed gathering. Long frocks were
seen everywhere, young ’maids and matrons
swishing around in yards and yards of lace
and other filmy textiles as happily as if
short frocks had never been heard of. The
trio of hon. secs, of this efficiently-run jazz
were Theo Gibb, who blended in her raiment
mushroom-pink tulle and lace; Margaret
Thompson and Betty Pullar. The Misses
Hamilton, principals of the college, were
guests of honor. Mrs. Frank Faulkner, in
dahlia-toned chiffon, was among the aiders
in the evening’s fun. In the bevy of girls
were Rosa Spowers and Moliie Neil, both
in black chiffon, and Alice Loxton, of
Bananaland, whose ivory-tinted taffetas were
scattered with blossoms.
Women students of our Uni. met in a
merry dance at Malvern Town Hall one
evening last week, and wore the latent modes
in skirts and the brightest and prettiest of
colors. Norma Gawno, in diaphanous shaded
cosmos, and Jeanette Dunstone, in brocaded
pink taffeta, were the hon. sees., and the
leading lady of the committee w*as Ruby
rowcll. who chose wrappings of blue chiffon.
Prof, and Mrs. W. E. Agar, Mr. and Mrs.
E. Crawford, Prof. Skeats, and R. T. E
Latham were among the special guests.
Mrs. Dan Taylor and Rose Paterson, who
are still in pursuit of coin for the Ambulance
organisation, enlisted the aid of Mrs. Cleve
Pratt and Mrs. Stewart Ferguson in run-
ning a dance for this cause at the Embassy
a few days ago. The pretty green and gold
ballroom attached to Jennie Brenan’s danc-
ing school is now one of our most select
dance resorts. Dr. Esme Anderson and some
others sold carnival caps and pap'er finery
to swell the proceeds.
Voluntary workers of the Renown Free
Kindergarten, South Yarra, led by Mrs.
Leslie Benjamin in soft raiment of black,
staged a cheery hop at the Rex to help their
school. About three hundred dancers were
roped in. Peggy King, whose flowered frock
blended tints of pale yellow and blue, and
Betty Erswell, who danced in leaf-green
velvet, were the joint lion, secs., with Edna
Carr, who chose myrtle-green lace, as
purse-holder. Dorothy Carlile, who directs
operations at the Kindergarten, was there in
a lace gown of daffodil shade.
This bright-looking lassie is Linda Parker,
who leaves on the 30th for Germany to'pur-
sue her pian-
istic studies
for a couple
of years. She

J. and N. Tait. The picture is by Broothorn.
For years and years the establishment
at St. Kiida of baths on the sea-front worthy
of the city and of the otherwise fine lay-
out of the beach has been talked about. Plan
after plan has been submitted to the local
civic fathers, but there has always been a
hitch somewhere. But now. a*t long last, the
Council has made up its mind and accepted a
tender at over £50,000 to put up ladies’
baths that will have caf6s and a gymnasium
as trimmings. The work is being put in
hand at this juncture mainly to help the
unemployed, with whom the municipality has
already shown a great deal of practical
sympathy. It is made a condition of the
contract" that local men only are to be
employed.
Women to the number of over GOO streamed
into the Windsor one afternoon last week
bent on playing bridge in the good cause of
St. Anthony’s Orphanage. Non-players
sipped tea and listened to vocal and instru-
mental music, Among the singers were
Marie Bremner and Amy Rochelle.
A “White Elephant” sale, organised by Ella
Guthrie last week for the District Nursing
Society, developed into a vending of many
really valuable antiques and knick-knacks.
These wares, mostly donated by wealthy
folk, numbered about 500, and thqy were
arranged in bazaar lines in the attractive
setting of No. 9, Darling-street. Brasses,
bronzes, pewter, lacquer and old silver made
a fascinating display; and there were stalls
of flowers and one stocked with dainty gar-
ments for infants. Miss Guthrie had as
saleswomen some society matrons and a
bunch of the younger set, which included
Marjorie Clarke, Audrey Poolman, Kath
Currie and Rosemary Hayne. Frank Walker
lent the building for the afternoon, and there
was good patronage. Among those who
made purchases were Irvine, C.J., and his
lady, Mrs. R. Clarke and Mrs. G. G. Jlen-
derson.
Here is a just-taken picture by Marietta
of Beatrice Day. who is joining her talents
with those of Gregan McMahon, and will
give lessons in
diction and
stage training
at the Bijou
Theatre studio.
It is a good
many years
since Miss
Day first
came this way.
It was as a
member of the
Brough - Flem-
ing company
that she first
saw a Mel-
bourne audi-
ence, and her
most recent
appear ance
here was in
“L ord and
La d y Algy”
with the Wil-
liam Faver-
sliam Co., at the Comedy. She is no believer
in specialism on the stage, holding by the
good old-fashioned dictum that a*ny actor or
actress who has received cori’ect training
should be able to play any part. The same
view was frequently expressed by Nellie
Veitch, the well-known Melbourne teacher of
stagecraft and voice culture, who lately
retired. It may be expected, therefore, that
the graduates of the McMahon-Day school,
like the pupils of Miss Veitch, will get a
very thorough grounding.
. When Lord Somers, concludes his stay with
us next year he will leave as a memorial
of his reign a permanent holiday camp for
boys. For two years his Ex. has been the
moving spirit in a camp in which periodi-
cally about SO boys of various grades .of
society have been gathered, the idea being
to promote good fellowship and eliminate
snobbery. The Governor announced the
glad tidings at a meeting of the Somers
Camp last week, and 15 boys at once volun-
teered to devote their Saturday afternoons
to clearing the land, which is at Balmarring,
Westernport Bay. The spot is ideal for
its purpose, being within stone’s-tlirow of
the sea. An athletic club has been formed
in conjunction with the undertaking, and
members are privileged to wear Lord
Somers’s racing colors —olive green, black
and white.
The Dandenong boy scouts now possess
their own hall, which was opened on Thurs-
day night, when a ball in aid of the good-
deeders’ funds was staged. The acquisi-
tion of the hall was made possible largely
through the generosity of Ada Armytage, of
Holm Park, Beaconsfield, a very practical
sympathiser. She also helped with the fur-
nishing, including the fitting up of the
gymnasium. The building is a fine affair,
with towers and turrets and a battlemented
facade. Scouts and cubs attended the ball
in full strength with posies for their bene-
factress, and the Mayoral Luxtons were
among the guests. The decorations were in
blue and gold, with totemic devices on ban-
nerettes. Twenty-seven white-clad debs.,
holding pink-and-blue posies, made their
curtsies, and were whirled off by their part-
ners to glide in an old-time waltz.
The work of Melbourne playwriter Isabel
Handley is in high favor with the W.E.A.
players of Adelaide, who give a show
monthly. Two of her short pieces have
recently been staged in the Holy City, and
on the first Saturday in August there will
be an all-Australian programme, which will
include three plays by Miss Handley and one
bv Betty Davies, also a Melbournite. There
is appreciation nearer home, too. Early next
month Mrs. Frank Apperly will stage Miss
Handley’s play “Handcuffs” at the Kelvin
Hall. The piece pleased The Bulletin
when it was performed in Sydney, and it was
that commendation which first interested the
Adelaide association in the playwright’s
work.
Sir Hugh Allen, director of the Royal
College of Music and Professor of Music at
Oxford, was not long among us when he
found that he was expected to provide a
talkie accompaniment to numerous tea-drink-
ings and hand-shakings. Fritz Hart, who,
like his predecessor, Marshall Hall, studied
at the R.C.M. before coming hero, lured the
famous musician to Albert-street Con. one
afternoon last week. In a few words to the
students, Sir Hugh dwelt upon the advan-
tages not only educational but social that
are to be gained by belonging to what he
called a conservatory. At the visitor’s
request Mr. Hart conducted the Con.’s ladies’
choir in two of his own compositions. Dawn
Harding and Bessie Dougall were the vocal
soloists of the occasion. The guest expressed
approbation and invited Mr. Hart to be
present at the jubilee junketings of the
R.C.M. in ’33. In the forefront of the
gathering were Mrs. Fritz Hart and Basil.
Mrs. Colin Fraser, Mrs. George Thirkell
and Mrs. Bremner and daughter Marie.
The director of the R.C.M. also attended
a soiree staged by the British Music Society
at Grong Grong, Toorak, the home of the
Tom Smiths. Elizabethan songs were
sung by Carrie Cairnduff and Herold Kyng
to an accompaniment of strings, and Hermia
Barton and John Simons played a Bach
Sonata for violin and piano.
There is flutter in Anglican circles in
Ballarat, for Dr. Crick, Bishop of the diocese,
who went to London for the Lambeth Con-
ference, has encountered Romance. During
the week he acquainted his* flock of his
engagement and pending marriage to Marion,
only daughter of Major and Mrs. Jelli-
course, of Chichester, Sussex.
Queen Victoria Hospital receives powerful
aid from its army of auxiliary workers. At
the annual tallying last week it was an-
nounced that £4SGS had been added to the
funds by their efforts in the 12 months.
It was also announced that,. following the
example of other similar institutions, it has
been decided to establish a. little shop in
the hospital grounds where visitors can pur-
chase dainties for patients, and where the
medical and nursing staff can also procure
tasty additions to their menu. It is ex-
pected that the building will be ready for
business in a few weeks’ time.
Passed out with dramatic suddenness
while conducting a rehearsal of the choir
at Scots Church on Thursday night, W. F.
G. Steele, long attached to that kirk as
conductor and organist. Mr. Steele was a
very small child when he came here from
England and became a pupil at All Saints'
Grammar School. In later life he made the
organ his special musical study. . He was
also deputy-conductor of the Philharmonic
Society. As managing director of Aeolian
(Australia), Ltd., he lately went on a busi-
ness visit to the U.S.A., returning, a couple
of months ago. He leaves a widow and
two children.
Several political associations engineered
by women lost a valued member on Thurs-
day by the death of Mrs. Margaret E.
Crocker, wife of Melbourne lawyer H. S.
Crocker. • When the Australian Women’s
National League came into existence 2ti
years ago Mrs. Crocker was a member of
the executive; and from 1922 to 1927 she
occupied the president’s chair, becoming, on
her resignation from that office, a life governor,
and she represented the A.W.N.L. on several
other organisations. Through ill-health she
had to give up these interests some time ago.
Mrs. Crocker did more than her share of
war work, and one of her two sons, .Captain
Clive Crocker, was killed at Gallipoli. Many
women will regret the passing of a staunch
friend and a diplomatic and tactful leader.
Melbourne has had the privilege of hear-
ing Florence Austral sing with an orchestra.
The audience positively poured into the
Town Hall on Saturday night, and the
packed house rose up and cheered the diva’s
declamation of the Valkyrie battle-cry.
Madame Austral was an imposing figure in
gold lame and lace. Bouquets and baskets of
flowers were piled up at her gold-shod feet.
Bernard Heinze conducted the band and
John Amadio shared in the. success of the
evening.
Leon Gordon shunted to the Comedy on
Saturday night to join Harvey Adams and
Ann Davis in “Tea for Three,” with Dulcie
Cherry, Frank Bradley and Cyril Wender as
factors in the brew. Leading ladies who
have appeared here previously in this trian-
gular plot are Marie Tempest and * Judith
Anderson. Miss Davis makes a charming
heroine and dresses effectively. She lunches
in a velvet suit of magpie blend with match-
ing head-covering; for dinner she wears. a
clinging white crepe romaine of exquisite
cut, and she pours afternoon tea in coat and
frock of wood-brown georgette. A full house
sent up lots of flowers on the first night.
The Younger Set Auxiliary of the Country
Women’s Association had a settling week of
returns from the two nights of “Incredible
Happenings” staged by the amateurs who call
themselves the Kilkare Revue Company. The
president, Mrs. Lucius Conolly, announced
that, thanks to the combined energies of
players and committee, there was a return of
£4OO. This is to be divided between the
Women’s Hospital and the auxiliary. .

THE PASSAGE
By VANCE PALMER
ILLUSTRATIONS BY ARIA
Synopsis : His father, Boh Cal-
laway, drowned at the bar of the
Passage, Lew has to support his
mother, Hughie and two other child-
ren. Lew is a fisherman, satisfied
enough with the life, hut slightly dis-
gruntled at the idea of having to carry
the heavy end of the log all his days.
Hughie, as a hoy, works at KunkeVs
store, then he runs a car service and
does so well that he goes to town to set
up in the ear business. Lew is attracted
by Clem McNair, daughter of a man
ivho has sold a large area of land
on one side of the Passage to Osborne,
a speculator, who has started a young
township upon it. Lcno’s diffidence
prevents, closer relationship, and Clem,
disappointed, decides to go abroad.
Lew then marries Lena Christensen,
who. had been keeping company with
Craig, a surveyor, but had assured
Lew that affair was “all off.” A
seven-months’ baby boy is born to
Lew, who, in the next year or so,
becomes entirely wrapped up in the
little fellow. The marriage, however,
is not a success: Lena becomes irri-
tated with Tjew and his interest
in liis work, and he grows weary
of her tired, bored smile He is in
town visiting Hughie and their mother
(Anna) when Lena has a surprise
meeting with Craig in the bush, where
she had gone ashore for a swim after
rowing.. Lena feels that she has quite
done with Craig, but his old attraction
proves too strong, and Lew, having
returned to find that Craig is back,
grows more and more suspicions. On
another visit to town he meets Clem,,
who is disappointed that he is return-
ing to the Passage that night,
CHAPTER XXVIII— {Continued).
IT was not often that a stone splashed into
the quiet current of Lew’s days, and he
was gazing at the steely expanse of
river in the evening light and watching a
circle widen and widen. Even when, later
on at the table, they were all talking of
Clem McNair, he merely sat with an
abstracted look on his face and listened to
the others. It was Hughie who had all
the news. The old doctor had died some
months before down in Sydney, it seemed,
leaving a couple of children by his second
wife, and there was some trouble about
his will. He had been interested in doubt-
ful patent medicines during his last days
and had heaped up a fortune—quite an
extraordinary one, Hughie asserted. Wasn’t
the Varley Health Institute, whose adver-
tisements stared at you from every paper,
really his idea? And hadn’t it been pour-
ing out a flood of salves, tonics and cure-
alls, till every kind of ailment was catered
for, from housemaid’s knee to appendicitis?
“The old quack could cure everyone but
himself,” Hughie laughed. “Ran a fish-
hook into his finger and let it become
septic! Now there’s a dispute about his
money. He’d been queer before he died
and made a fresh will, leaving everything
to the youngest kids. Clem’s brothers are
going to fight it.”
Anna looked up in her sardonic way.
“I should think Clem herself would be
wanting a finger in the pie, too. She didn’t
come back here for nothing.”
“She’s already got a bit of an income
of her own,” said Hughie. “Wangled it,
somehow. Says she doesn’t want anything
now but the old house by the Passage.
The old man had hung on to it all these
years, though the Lord alone knows why.
It could have been sold a dozen times over.
Clem reckons it was really given to her
years ago, though she’s never had the
deeds.”
“Isn’t she wonderful?” mused Dot with
shining eyes. “Makes most of the people
round her seem only half alive. And not
a bit of side about her! As easy to talk
to as if she’d never been anywhere or seen
anything!”
Her mother’s laugh had a harsh note.
“Of all the sentimental rubbish I ever
heard! What would you expect her to
do, child? Cut the lot of us dead? The
daughter of an old quack like that hasn’t
much excuse to look over anyone else’s
head.”
Lew’s eyes flashed for the first time.
“Who has, then? Any of us Callawaj's?”
There was a sharpness in his voice that
made his mother flush.
“I should think some of us could hold
our heads high if we wanted to. If we’ve
got on, it’s been by hard going, taking it
out of ourselves rather than other people,
and making every shilling do the work of
two Aren’t you satisfied with what
yoi#ve done yourself?”
“Not particularly,” said Lew, in a way
that closed the subject.
When the meal was over he hurried off to
catch the boat, but even before he reached
the road along the river he knew that he
was not going back just then. There were
several little business matters in town he
had never had time to attend to; month
after month he had left them because he
was always in a fever to get home. There
was really n<p need to get back, though;
things could jog along quite easily without
him. At the boat he could send word by
old Tom that he had been kept on business.
Yet as he threaded his way down to the
docks he had to admit it was the arrival
of Clem, and that alone, that kept him
there. Something had been loosening in
his mind ever since he had met her that
aiternoon; it was almost as if a stream of
life that had been congealed under ice was
beginning to flow again. Slowly, very
slowly! It was not his nature to thaw at
the first touch of the sun.
“Young Peter,” he was thinking. “He’ll
be up early to-morrow, waiting for the boat.
Poor old kid! I ought to have had sbme-
thing to send him.”
But the underground part of his mind
was fixed upon Clem. He was inly excited
about, her, moved by the swallow-curve of
the wings of her hat as much as by the way
her eyes had flashed probing glances into
his own. It was only the unexpectedness
of her appearance that had made him so
dull and casual when they had met; he
had been buried deep down in the bog of
his everyday thoughts, even there on that
bright hillside among the dust and racket
of racing cars. Shortage of cargo for the
homeward trip, Craig’s return, the way
Lavinia was likely to go down now that
Osborne and his syndicate were getting out!
It took time for him to register any con-
tact, no matter how vivid and arresting.
That , was the way he was made.
But he was fully alive now, filled with
the same heady lightness that used to
make his feet skim along swiftly when he
ran to meet Clem years ago over the stretch
of green buffalo grass and along the strip
of sandy beach. What was in her mind
now she had come back? What did she
mean by saying she was a wash-out? She
didn’t seem to have dropped her bundle;
whatever experiences she had gone through
over there hadn’t taken the sap out of her
or given her a wrong twist. Quite the other
way round! It looked as if she had found
herself over there, become her own woman.
At the boat, which lay in an arm of the
river, making a yellow smudge of light in
the surrounding darkness, old Tom was
leaning over the rails with his cap cocked
on one side, while the deckhands played
euchre on the hatch.
“A bit late, aren’t you?” he greeted Lew.
“There’s some dirty weather blowing up
from the south-east. We ought to be across
the bay before it comes.”
“Get her out, then,” said Lew. “I’m
not coming this time.... Tell Peter his
uncle Hughie won again and that I’ll be
home in the next boat.”
“Good!” said Rahilly, fumbling in the
pocket of his trousers. “By the way, there
was a message came for you an hour or
two ago, Lew. Boy from one of the hotels
brought it. I don’t know if it’s anything
important.”
He drew a crumpled envelope from his
pocket and Lew recognised Clem’s hand-
writing. Something she had scribbled down
after going back to her hotel that evening!
“No, it’s nothing important,” he said.
“I’ll give you a hand to get out into the
river, Tom, and you can drop me when we
get under way. Shove a tarpaulin over
that deck stuff in case it begins to blow.”
CHAPTER XXIX.
Paddymelon Country.
“Your mother’s goin’ off,” Jimmy Haig
said to Peter. “I see’d her catch the horse.
....Some day she’ll go off and won’t come
back no more.”
His blotched little face, with its broken
stumps of teeth, was wreathed in a mali-
cious grin, for he knew this was one of the
best ways of upsetting Peter, and he really
had caught sight of the brown mare tied
to the fence and Milly taking the saddle
down from its peg under the house. Peter
had been solemnly catching soldier-crabs
and putting them in treacle-tins, sorting-
out the porcelain-blue ones from the
yellow and black, but he looked up quickly
when Jimmy spoke. More than once Jimmy
had told him that his mother would go
off one day and never come back; Jimmy
had heard Mrs. Wiegert and the other
women say so. And somehow there did
seem a danger of this since she had bought
the brown mare, because she didn’t like
the Passage, and because—well, there was
the look on her fa.ce when she stood on the
verandah in the afternoons, staring down
at the broken punts by the jetty and the
heaps of mullet-weed steaming in the heat.
He didn’t know why, but that look on her
face made him feel empty inside.
He straightened his back and gazed up
at the house where Milly was shaking some
rugs over the rails of the verandah. The
brown mare certainly did seem to be whisk-
ing her tail by the side-fence, saddled and
ready for the road, and his mother was
coming down the verandah and speaking to
Milly. She had on the brown, floppy hat
she wore when she was going riding and
there was a switch in her hand.
“If she’s going, I’m going, too,” he told
Jimmy. “You can have my crabs and the
little whiting.”
And throwing down the treacle-tin he
scrambled up the breakwater.
It was a brilliant morning after heavy
rain, the drying earth richly scented, the
strip of smooth water nearly the same
color as the sky, with the sandbanks float-
ing on it like pearly clouds. In the middle
of the current Corny Lait had anchored his
black punt, and was sitting with his knees
tucked up to his chin and his pipe in his
mouth, waiting for a cod. Lamont, his
trousers rolled up to his knees, was over-
hauling his launch at the mouth of the
saltwater creek, leaning over the bows and
scraping at something with a knife. In
her yard Dora Wiegert was struggling with
the red poddied calf Kunkel’s wife had
given her, dragging it across to tie it to
the post of the clothes-line. Voices came
from further down the channel. It was
some visitors who had come up the Passage
the night before and had anchored in front
of the Haigs; they were bathing between
the anchored launch and the jetty, two men
and two girls, all dark as if they had been
living naked in the sun for months.
“Where ’re you going, Mum?” Peter
demanded breathlessly, scrambling through
a hole in the fence and coming to the foot
of the steps.
Lena was standing at the top, tying her
brown gossamer under her chin. She had
on a short, divided skirt and the high
leather boots Peter liked playing with be-
cause of their crinkly softness. Like silk
they were when you rolled them in your
hands.
“I thought you were playing with
Jimmy,” she said, frowning. “Milly’s going
to take lunch out to those she-maks above
the bar, and you can boil the billy and
have a good time together. Won’t that
be fun?”
“No,” said Peter stubbornly. “I’m going
with you.”
“But you can’t,” she told him. “Don’t
be a little nark, Peter. Do you think I
can carry you round with me everywhere,
hanging on like a baby bear? With Jimmy
watching you, too! A great joke that would
be for him! Wasn’t he poking fun at you
a few days ago because he saw you riding
behind me?”
A sulky look came to Peter’s face. It
hurt when Jimmy cliiacked him, but it hurt
more when his mother overheard. She
usually just laughed, as if she found Jimmy
funny. He didn’t want to go up the
beach with Jimmy and his sister to-day.
They would quarrel, and Milly would take
Jimmy’s part and tell him he was a cry-
baby who ought to have a bucket and
spade, like some of the little goldilocks kids
who came down from the hotel with their
nurses.
He hung on to the palings of the fence
as his mother adjusted the saddle and
pulled the girths tight. The brown mare
would have enough to carry, she was telling
him, for she was going a long way and
wouldn’t be back till after dark. If he
didn’t want to go up the beach he could
get Milly to take the punt and row over
to the island.
But it all washed oyer Peter like foam.
He pouted his lips, darkly persistent.
“Couldn’t I go with you just as far as
the bridge ? I’d come straight back....
You said I could have a ride next time.
Promised me last Sunday when Dad didn’t
come back by the boat.”
Lena made a gesture of wry despair.
“Oh, my God, Peter, you’d wear down a
grindstone.... All right! Jump up.”
She had a feeling that a dozen eyes
were on her that morning, watching her
every movement. Milly had wanted to
know how far she was going and where
she would get her lunch, an impudent look
in her face that showed she knew quite
well. And there down at the mouth of the
saltwater creek was Lamont, squatting in
the bows of his launch, and resting as he
filled his pipe. She could guess what was
in his mind as he looked over:
“Ah, she’s heard Craigie’s back again on
a job near Glenrowan! Don’t take news
like that long to travel. When the cat’s
away”
She sprang into the saddle and cantered
off. Almost through the back of her head
she could feel Dora Wiegert’s eyes as the
woman straightened herself after picking up
some pegs under the clothes-line. Later on
she would meet Dave’s wife or Mrs. Haig,
coming back from the store or down at
the breakwater, where they cleaned their
fish, and would say in a husky whisper
with her eyes goggling:
“Take it from me, she’s on with that
fellow again. It wasn’t to Glenrowan she
was going this morning. She hasn’t been
near the place for a couple of years—not
since her last quarrel with her brother.”
Once Lena would have found a fierce
delight in shocking these people, in giving
them something to wag their tongues about.
They had never liked her; they had in-
stinctively felt there was a breach between
her and Lew and had sided with Lew. She
couldn’t get on with them, couldn’t flatten
herself out to keep down to their level.
Even when they were being neighborly, she
had a feeling they were using this little
incident or that to put themselves on an
equal footing with her, and it goaded her
into an attitude of patronising aloofness;
she kept from entering their houses or
joining their committees for sports or
dances. Lew could do what he liked, she
told herself. Let them call him by his front
name and treat him as one of the crowd;
she was going to keep her head up!
But her pleasure in outraging them had
been part of a self-confidence that was not
so strong in her now. Craigie had been
camped .for the best part of a month
somewhere at the back of Glenrowan and
had sent her no word! She had written
to him nearly a week ago, asking him to
come over, but he hadn’t answered. Was
it just mischance, or had his passion for
her flickered out? The very thought of
that made a bleak wind blow over her
heart. Her feeling for him was very differ-
ent from the quick attraction that had
drawn her to him as a girl; it had become
a hunger that gnawed at her. For the last
three nights she had lain awake, staring
at the glint of the moon on some new
kerosene-tins by the beach, and trying to
imagine he was riding over the plains to
say he had come because he couldn’t live
without her.
“You’ve had a rough spin, Lena....
We’ve both mucked up our lives Let’s
cut the tangle and start again; we’ve got-
some good years ahead of us.”

Whispers in the dark, vows that for the
first time had meaning, a sense of passion
blossoming again from the bare stem!
But to-morrow night Lew would be back
in the boat, and life would become as
empty as an old punt on a sandbank.
She cantered on, hardly .conscious of
Peter’s arms around her. A flat stretch of
plain, where the sand gleamed like snow
between the tufts of bleached grass, and
inconspicuous flowers melted in a delicate
wash of color! The thin, straight trunks of
tea-trees gleamed whitely, their tips flaming
with reddish-gold. Far across the plain
you could see little dark specks; they might
be cattle or blackened stumps. It was the
thought of cattle that brought Lena’s mind
back to Peter, and she reined up with a
jerk.
“Goodness, we’ve come more than a mile
past the bridge! Why didn’t you tell me,
you naughty boy? How’ll you get home,
now?”
Peter slipped to the ground, flushed and
exultant.
“It’s not far. I can walk. I’ve been
nearly as far as this before.”
“Well, hurry home and don’t get off the
track. Mill.V’ll be wondering where on
earth you are. If young Wiegert comes
past in the car, ask him for a ride.”
She ambled off, looking back at him
doubtfully over her shoulder; then shaking
her switch with a playful gesture leant
forward and urged her brown mare into a
hand gallop.
Peter trudged back through the hot sand,
kicking it up with his shoes, and stooping
now and then to examine the prickly marks
the lizards’ feet made when
they ran across it. That strip
of white road was more inter-
esting than the beach. The
sand was fine as flour, excit-
ing to touch, and every foot-
print, whether of bird or beast,
stood out like something just
written there. He was plunged
in thought as 1 he meandered
on. So many live things all
around, creeping about on their
secret ways, and yet nothing
to be seen on the wide plain
but a sweep of honey-colored
grass, reddened here and there
by boronia, or whitened by
patches of native jasmine that
looked like the sand showing
through.
That big, furry pad must be
a dog’s. Or did it belong to the
dingo that came after Mrs.
Wiegert’s fowls? The dingo
was frightening to think about
in the night-time when it
howled from the timber by the
saltwater creek, but it wasn’t
so frightening now. Martin
had shot at it a week ago just
before sunrise and told them
he had hit it, but when he and
Jimmy looked on the grass by
the fence there was no blood.
Not the tiniest drop they could
find! Perhaps it had bled
inside and gone off to die in
the paddymelon country where
it had its cubs and hiding-
place. Jimmy said it came
from the paddymelon country
where they got the Christmas bells.
He stood for a while staring at a little
cattle-pad that led off the road at right
angles and ran by the side of a swampy
belt, thick with tea-tree. That must be
where they went for the Christmas bells!
A man living near the lighthouse had come
riding in the day before with a big scarlet-
and-gold sheaf of them hanging from his
saddle-bow, knocking against the horse’s
muddy flanks. And Milly had talked of
going out on Sunday with Martin Wiegert.
They were just beginning to come on, she
said; you could see miles of them in the
paddymelon country, only you wanted a
horse, because the grass was so high and
there were spongy holes between the little
hills they grew on.
Peter had an aching hunger to see miles
of Christmas bells. What a great thing
if he could get an armful and fill the house
with them! How astonished his father
would be when he came home; and he
would be able to say proudly:
“I got them all by myself, Dad. I’ve
been to the paddymelon country. There’s
miles and miles of them out there.”
He stumbled on, keeping an eye on the
bleached plain to the right for the first
trace of scarlet and gold. Parrots swarmed
through the blossoming tea-tree, shrieking
as they tore the honey from the flowers;
goannas scuttled through the crackly lan-
tana; sulphur butterflies danced over the
miles of grass on the other side. This
was better than going out with Milly! He
wasn’t at all hungry; he never did feel
hungry on hot days like this. Only it would
be nice if there was some clean water to
drink instead of the blackish, swampy stuff
that lay every here and there and looked
like senna in a dirty cup.
Away from the timber the track led, and
light into the heart of the plain, which
became broken and lumpy, tussocks of tal!
grass standing on islands, with sludgy
channels between. This must be the paddy-
melon country! On and, on it stretched;
there was no end to it.
The first Christmas bell Peter saw sent
a thrill right down his spine. There it
stood on its tall stalk, much bigger than he
expected and as exciting as the first bar
in anew orchestral record. He couldn’t
break it off with his fingers, but there was
a knife in his trousers’ pocket. And when
he had clambered to the knob it grew on
he could see another bell and yet another,
peeping out above the high grass.
Miles of them, really, if only you were
tall enough to see! But it was hard work
getting from one knob to another. You
fell down where the dried grass lay in
drifts covering smelly water that rose above
your knees. And there might be snakes!
Old Tom said the paddymelon country was
“....And Lew was locked in the room where the small form lay wrapped in a sheet.”
full of big blank ones that lived on the
frogs. Corny Lait had been bitten once
and would have died if he hadn’t cut his
toe nearly off with a knife and drunk a
bottle of whisky.
How still everything was! Peter could
hear nothing but the swish of the tall
grass and the laboring of his own breath
as he panted from one knob to another.
Yet now and then it felt as if something
was lurking in the long grass not very far
away. Something that made no noise, but
shifted its position whenever he moved!
Bending over a cut stem, he was suddenly
aware of a shadow falling over his shoulder.
He waited for it to shift, but it didn’t
shift. Then with his heart in his mouth
he turned his head slowly round.
A shrill scream came from his throat, a
scream he didn’t recognise as his own.
Blacks painted for a corroboree, their spears
standing up in serried ranks, their dark eyes
staring through rings of white! Rigid
and terrible they stood, making no sound,
merely watching him with a fixed look that
was awful in its intensity. It was only
for a moment that he saw them like that,
but the vision changed the world for him,
turning his knees to water and his heart to
a bubble that might burst at any moment.
He didn’t want any more Christmas bells.
He wanted to get away. Back through the
tall grass that tripped him as he ran, and
grew taller the further he went.
How was it that a bunch of grass-trees,
blackened by fire, and with little spots of
white in their dark plumes could put teri’or
into him like that! He was sobbing still,
talking in a broken way through his tears,
telling himself he wasn’t really afraid.
There weren’t any more blacks; they had
all died years ago when old Tom was a
boy. And they weren’t really frightening,
Tom always said, just jolly and full of
tricks. It was only in pictures you saw
them like that, with feathery things on
their heads and white paint round the eyes.
Pictures couldn’t, come alive!
Stumbling lie touched a broken root, and
something uncoiled near his hand with a
slow, fluid motion, pouring itself leisurely
into the dried grass. Ankle-deep in water,
he remained staring at the place where the
snake had gone, too paralysed to move.
The black, enamelled body with its gleam-
ing, red belly mesmerised him as it would
a bird. It remained before his eyes long
after it had passed, flowing endlessly into
the long grass. Miles and miles of it!
He was running, falling, picking himself
up and running on again. The Christmas
bells had fallen from his arms, but he
couldn’t go back now. Where had he
dropped them? Where the blacks stood
with their white-painted eyes and their
plumed spears? Or where the snake flowed
into the long grass? The fear of darkness
was upon him. If only he could get out
of the paddymelon country and see the
thin, worn N track again! Parting the grass
with his arms he staggered on and on
CHAPTER XXX.
Lew Comes Home.
Never did the twenty-mile Passage seem
so beautiful to Lew as when he entered it
from the bay after a trip to town. Once
through the narrow mouth at Cardigan
Point the slapping of the lumpy water
ceased, and everything took on the stillness
of a lake, tiny islands of green mangroves
floating on the quiet surface as if they had
no moorings, and the mountains rising up
from the flat country of the mainland like
shapes of glass. Flocks of swans fed on the
mullet-weed in the shallows or drifted in
flotillas across the wider reaches; the
channel narrowed into a green lane and
opened out again; there was a bump now
and then as the flat-bottomed boat touched
a bar of sand. Clear as glass the water
looked, except in the deeper patches where
the weed grew; you could see the whiting
feeding in small groups over the pearly
floor and the dark shapes of flathead lying
half-buried in sand. Such an enchantment
seemed to hold everything in those few
miles of landlocked water that even the
birds hai’dly rose at the boat’s approach,
but steered quietly out of the way.
Since he was a boy every bay and creek
mouth had been known to Lew, and each
held some separate memory. How often
he had come down there with his father
and Uncle Tony, crabbing among the man-
groves or shooting a net at the mouth of
some saltwater creek! They would pitch
their camp in a protected spot on the fore-
shore and stay often for a week, cleaning
their catches and smoking them with green
wattle in a roughly-rigged shed of hessian.
An easy, timeless life, with patches of hard
work and long spells of lying on the grass,
smoking and spinning yarns, or just watch-
ing the flight of birds along the water.
Such days and nights were good to re-
member. They kept his father and Uncle
Tony alive for him, kept a sense of con-
tinuity in his own life.
He sat on a coil of rope in the bows, chew-
ing at his cold pipe, and letting Clem’s face
come between him and the green mangrove
islands. There wasn’t much about her life
in the last few years she hadn’t told him,
but he had difficulty in taking it in; all
her experiences had been so different from
his own, the very air she had breathed had
been so different. And there had been some
thing!* he could only gather from her in-
directly, straightening out the twist of her
words. Who was this Donovan she talked
about, for instance? What sort of life had
they lived together? At times when she had
brought up his name he had had a feeling
that she had been humiliated at
the very core of her being, flat-
tered about her talent by a
crawler who was only thinking
of her little bit of money, dis-
carded when she was no longer
useful. But when he had foimd
that the blood burning behind
his eyes and rough words
coming to his lips, she had
laughed drily. No, he mustn’t
take it as if she were telling
him a pathetic story! She
hadn’t been deceived by anyone;
she had always got from others
as much as she had given. Things
usually worked out like that!
“One can’t pick up knowledge
cheap,” she said. “I’m not growl-
ing at the price I paid for
mine What about you,
Lew?”
.He had evaded the question.
He couldn’t talk coherently about
his own life, about Lena, or
even about Peter; still less
could he keep his tongue going
among abstractions. He wasn’t
sure he had learnt anything defi-
nite from the quiet procession
of his days. This thing had
happened and then that. He
had just lived from one day to
the next.
Yet as he sat there, looking at
the familiar landmarks of creek-
mouth and mangrove-covered
headland, he was aware of some-
thing in himself that had grown
and gained character with the
years. Something that gave him
unity and power. Deep down its roots
were thrust into his being, drinking at
hidden springs. He was Lew Callaway,
and whatever he said carried weight with
the men about him, old Tom and the
rest; wasn’t, it from him they drew part of
their vitality and gusto for the daily round?
Yet it was only his meeting with Clem that
had given him this consciousness of himself,
this knowledge of having stores of life
from which people could draw. Clem’s
eyes, darting in upon him, set him tingling
with a sense of his own fertility. He sat
remembering things she had said, the move-
ments of her hands and shoulders.
“It’s old Tom coming out,” said the voice
of McEvojr beside him. “Now, what the
devil does he want? Ought to have passed
him last night in the bay.”
Lew stood up and looked narrowly at
the oncoming dinghy that had suddenly
appeared from the mangroves. Evidently
it had been waiting there, two or three
miles from home, for the boat’s approach.
“More trouble!” he said. “I guess some-
thing’s gone wrong either with the Groper’s

Brisbane.
Some three months ago the Queensland
district executive of the R.S.S.I.L. invited
Brisbane women to knit socks for unem-
ployed Diggers; and some 500 women got
busy with 2000 skeins of wool. Mrs. Lin-
coln Hollaway and Mrs. G. A. Potter, who
sent in the first ten shillings and the first
two pairs of socks, are both over 80.
The National Council of Women arranged
a meeting to hear Captain Max Wardell
speak on International Peace. Mrs. Cum-
brae Stewart was in the chair. Perhaps the
captain’s most arresting statement was that
Germany was the most prosperous country
in the world just now.
The staff of the Taxation Department
gave a ball at the Trocadero in aid of the
Children’s Hospital. A large magnet, show-
ing on one side a Scotchman and on the
other a capitalist, formed the entrance. T)ver-
head, in the middle of the ballroom, hung
a huge axe, in black and silver, labelled
Tax Axe, and “Many Happy Returns” was
the greeting over the stage. Commissioner
Magee’s lady was in black chantilly lace.
The 42nd show of the Queensland Art
Society was opened by the Premier. Presi-
dent P. Stanhope Hobday and Jeanette
Sheldon welcomed him and Mrs. Moore.
Catherine Barker has a study of J. A.
Philp and several minor paintings, “Pensive
Moments” and “Coral Flowers” the most
striking. Enid Dickson exhibits “Kathleen,”
a study of a schoolgirl. Hubert Jarvis has
five water-colors, and William Bustard shows
some capital work. Gwendolyn Grant is
happy in her outdoor pictures of light and
sea and happy youth; Frankie Payne (Mrs.
Clinton), of Sydney, who is here on a visit,
is effective in “Study of a Baby” ; and Jessie
Traill (Melbourne) has some compelling
etchings. Vida Lahey shows eight paintings.
The monotypes shown by the president are
the first hung. at any of the .society’s exhi-
bitions ; wmodcarvings, pottery and bronzes
are also on view.
In aid of the Holy Name Cathedral build-
ing fund, the ballroom and palm court at
Lennon’s blossomed out into deep pink flow-
ers and Iceland poppies for a bridge and
musical matinee. Mesdames F.. Cullen. NCI
McDermott and P. F. Crowe hostessed.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
Red, blue and gold streamers hanging wis-
taria fashion among the greenery decked the
Cottesloe Hall for the Scotch College old
boys’ dance. Headmaster I’. C. Anderson
brought Flora and Mary, both in the green
of early spring. The George Campbells were
there, she in moonlight-blue georgettes; and
the Jack Wades, the lady wearing black
chantilly laces ; Mrs. Harry Gorrie wore red ;
Dorothy Howe and Helen Crammond chose
flowered chiffons; Betty Holland was in tan-
gerine ; Grace Nunn wore azure-blue laces;
and sister Tess orchid georgettes; diamente
twinkled upon Olive Keightley’s blue ninon;
and turquoise laces swished about Nancy
Pearson; Ethel Gordon wore petunia taffetas
and tulle; Mrs. Robinson favored black ; and
Dolly Broadhurst chilli-red chiffons.
James Mitchell and his lady, with other
members of the Nationalist party, were enter-
tained at tea in Temple Court by the Women’s
Central National Party. Mrs. Vance, who
acted as hostess, fashioned a posy of sweet-
peas as nearly, red, white and blue as are
grown, tied with the Empire’s ribbons, for
presentation to the Premier’s helpmate. The
guests included president Mrs. Burnett, in a
chocolate-brown rig, the E. H. Angelos, Mr.
T. A. L. Davy, Mrs. Mary Farrelly and Mrs.
Helen Clarkson.
Tw T enty-one candles stood guard oil the
coming-of-age birthday cake of the Women’s
Service Guilds of Westralia. The banquet
was spread in the Town Hall, and there were
speeches by the Mayor and a number of pro-
minent women. .
Congratulations are being heaped upon
Helen Ambrose and Tom Moore, wliose wed-
ding bells ring on July 16. Recently an-
nounced engagements are those of vivacious
Molly Beck and Geoffrey, eldest son of Major
and Mrs. Playford, of Adelaide, and Montie
Holland and George Ivelsall.
A glowing fire and bowls of poinsettias
made a cheery contrast with the soaking
outer world for the Repertory Club’s musi-
cal afternoon. Dorothy Mark, wearing brown
tweeds, did the arranging; Veronica Kenni-
well played, Joyce Mortlock recited and
Madame Synnot and Mrs. Cecil Treadgold
sang. The voice of the last-named artist,
while singing recently at 6WF, was picked
up in the U.S.A.
A racing-boat that had carried to victory
a crew of a previous generation was suspended
under the chandeliers at Temple Court for
the Christian Brothers’ College annual frolic.
Red and black ribbons and _ colored lights
stretched from boat to balconies, and green-
ery clustered round the pillars. A small
boy presented posies to her Ex. and the
Mayoress. Lady Campion, in honey-colored
moire, brought Dick Forster, in black ninon;
silver and a hint of blusli-pink garbed Mrs.
Walter Dwyer; Mrs. O’Hara was in black
ring velvet, and her daughter wore pale-pink
georgettes. Mrs. Baker lightened her black
with a gold spray of blooms; Noreen Riley
chose black tulle; Madame Antoine, in black
satin,, shepherded her daughter in blue pussy-
willow ; black ninon over primrose was Mrs.
Davidson’s choice, and gold laces were Ellen
Mulcahy’s.
Clusters of golden wattle, the twinkle of
eighteenth-century street lamps and miles
.of orange, ribbons decorated the Princess
Hall. Clarenfont, for the Wattle Ball. Jean
Lang, who thought out the color scheme,
wore georgettes patterned in henna and old
rose; sister Pat’s floral gown was mostly
primrose arid lilac; black satin and georg-
ettes fashioned Mrs. A. J. Baker’s hand-
some garment; shell-pink georgettes flut-
tered about youthful daughter Dorothy; Mrs.
Barney Kiernan’s black boasted pink motifs ;
silver beads glittered among Doreen O’Hara’s
sunset chiffons; Margaret Mulcahy wrapped
her slimness in apple-greens.
Philanthropist Charles McNess and his
wife left by the Orvieto for the Cold Coun-
try, where they will remain indefinitely.
Mr. McNess has given over £60,000 to
charity, not including a guaranteed £l4O
per week for the relief of unemployment in
this State.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
Amy Johnson will be able to look back
upon her stay in Adelaide as the quietest
experience in any Australian capital. There
were two dances in her honor, at neither of
which Was she expected to make a speech,
the Aero Ball at the Palais Royal, followed
by a fancy-dress, dance at the Moulden lady’s
residence. Aniy wore a smart frock of
ivory ring velvet; the two-tier skirt was
short, and looked odd among the many
trailing gowns. She had a very good time,
and there were no selected partners for her;
the early bird scored.
The Mayoress gave a cheery little recep-
tion for the air-ess at the conclusion of the
civic sliivoo in the Town Hall, when the
diamond brooch from the women of Adelaide
was officially presented—it had been pinned
on Amy’s frock a bit earlier in the Mayoress's
room.
The Adelaide Hunt Club held its annual
ball at the Palais Royal, where the scarlet
color scheme, a realistic brush fence, two
wax-headed huntsmen and a stuffed fox sup-
plied the proper atmosphere. His Ex. and
Lady Hore-Ruthven, with their guest Miss
Hope Pritchard, Premier and Mrs. Hill, and
the Mayor and Mayoress were present.
There were 36 in the opening set of Lancers,
and the ladies all looked fascinating in
white satin skirts, scarlet coats, hair poudre,
and black picture hats, while the men wore
scarlet coats with pale blue facings. The
dance itself was quite creditable, although
it must have been new to most. The most
finished performer was Mrs. W. T. Mort-
lock, who about bolds the record for attend-
ance at Hunt Club Balls.
The Artillery Ball at the Norwood Town
Hall on Friday night was well attended. Tht
men looked very dashing in their dark blue
uniforms, and the presence of their Exes,
ensured a fine display of decorations.
A unique gift—although a typically Aus-
tralian one —that Amy Johnson w r ill carry
home came from the Diggers of Keswick
Hospital, Adelaide. It was a Tatt.’s ticket
in the Melbourne Cup !
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
Lieut.-Col. L. R. Thomas, Registrar of
the Tas. University, is one of Hobart’s
busiest citi-
zens. Barrister
of the Middle
Temple, he
served during
the war with
the 11th Divi-
sion at Galli-
poli, and was
for 21 years
in Meso p o-
tamia, where
he commanded
a unit in the
fi e 1 d before
being attached
to. the Head-
quarters Staff
in Bagdad. A
D.S.O. came
his way when
Kut was re-
taken. Among
the celebrities
he has known
are Gertrude Bell, the warm friend of the,
Arabs, who did much to help King Feisal
to his throne, and “Laurence of Arabia.”
Among his numerous jobs Col. Thomas holds
the secretaryship of the Rep, Theatre Society.
His Ex. and daughter Margaret attended
the St. Patrick’s College Ball, in the Albert
Hall, Launceston. The stage was furnished
as a lounge for the guests, and the supper
tables were decorated with Iceland poppies
and violets. Among those at the v.-r. table
were Private Sec. N. E. Somers, Archbishop
Hayden, Dean Hennessy, Bro. O’Donnell
(Principal of St. Pat’s), Commander and
Mrs. Eardley-Wilmot, Chief Sec. and Mrs.
C. E. W. James, General and Mrs. W.
Martin, Dep. Mayor and Mayoress Barber
and Col. Harrap. Three debs., Muriel de
Santo, Mary Morgan and Greta Green,
made their bows.
Lieut.-Col. Thomas scored a win with his
production of “Summer is A-Coming In,”
by Louis N. Parker, played by the Univer-
sity Dramatic Club at the Theatre Royal.
There were good houses on both nights. We
get little enough of professional shows in
Hobart, and in this case the home-made
article was thoroughly appreciated.
Dr. and Mrs. J. C. Lee, who have been
spending the last weeks of their stay in the
Speck with their daughter and son-in-law, the
Geoff. Butlers, of Redcotes, Bagdad, return to
their U.S. home this month. Their impres-
sions of the Speck are expected to find their
way into print presently.
Mrs. Edwin Webster made her presiden-
tial gesture at the Queen Mary Club by
bidding all its members to tea and bridge.
The rooms were decorated with great sprays
of scarlet oak in its vivid autumn coloring,
blue delphiniums and deep gold and brown
chrysanthemums. Lounge, card-rooms, draw-
ing- and tea-rooms were packed. Mrs.
Webster wore a smart tailored suit in black,
with small black close-fitting hat.
There was a big muster of members to
hear the result of the Lyceum Club’s com-
petition for an original song, both words and
music. Mrs. J. E. C. Knight won first prize,
but there were several interesting numbers
where the words were by one competitor, the
music by another. Among the singers were
Mrs. Blair Hay, Miss Enid Knight, Miss
Laingford and Mrs. Montfort.
Ex-Mayor and Mayoress Valentine are
off for a trip to Sydney and Brisbane and
thence to Ceylon.
“Up Top” : One of the kindliest souls in
the Mandated Territory is a German, old
Freddy Schmall, befriender of many a down-
and-out. It was he who originated some-
thing on the lines of a benevolent society
for paying the fares of distress cases back
to Aussie. Freddy’s benefactions have
always left him poor, and when it became
known that the old man was seriously ill
and badly in need of a change the Territory
sent round the hat and packed him off to
Sydney. He is interpreter and translates
the German lands deeds in Rabaul. When
asked what his job is he invariably replies
“Some people call me interrupter of the
Court.”
A good sportsman was James Bennie Reid,
who died recently at San Remo (Italy).
He was the second son of the late John Reid,
of Elderslie, near Oamaru (M.L.), where a
famous Clydesdale stud made history years
ago. The son’s name was a household one
in Dominion racing circles, but he yearned
for fresh worlds to conquer, and bought
Banstead M'anor, at Newmarket (Eng.),
where he launched racing stables. His
horse Black Watch won the Goodwood Stakes
in 1927, and was third in the Derby the
following year. Reid’s advocacy of the totali-
sator hastened its arrival in the Cold
Country.
The “Commissaries” who run affairs in
Russia have abolished Sunday and Christmas
and New Year’s Day, but as the year must
commence some time, unless all years are
wiped out, a fresh New Year’s Day has been
appointed for November 1. The seven-day
week has gone into the discard. In place of
it there is a subdivision' of five days, named
after colors, and the community is divided
into five categories, each with its own day
or color off. Thus a man, his concubine
(marriage having been transformed into a
soluble arrangement) and their child may
be off-color on different days and take their
pleasure alone, the parents possibly galli-
vanting with parents who don’t belong to
them, and the child getting mixed up with
the traffic. There are to be 12 months of
30 days each, and five revolutionary feast
days, provided the victuals hold out. The
Creation has been shifted to 1917, so this
is the year 13. Commerce will be difficult
if the Russian insists on dating his cheques
“Green Day. in the 6tli week of February,
14,” but it is doubtless intended that other-
nations shall follow suit and restore
uniformity.
Artist Neville Smith sends Easter
greetings to Sydney friends from Phoenix,
Arizona. Arizona has provided the versa-
tile Australian with plenty of opportunities.
“Last winter,” he writes, “I had many_ con-
cert engagements and was asked to give a
series of lectures about Australia, though,
of course, my real work is painting”—-he
has a steady job at the local School of Allied
Arts. “When it became too hot here in the
summer—l2odeg. in the shade—l hopped off
to Honolulu and painted for nine weeks. Had
three exhibitions, and sold just enough pic-
tures to pay for the whole trip. Amongst my
best buyers was Mrs. W. A. Clark, widow
of Senator Clark, the ‘Copper King,’ who is
reputed to have done more for the living artist
than any other American. The Senator founded
many painting scholarships and had one of
the finest collections of Modern Art in
America. Mrs. Clark lives at fashionable
Santa Barbara in California, and is making
her own collection in her lovely home there.”
“But I don’t go to Mexico any more,”
Neville Smith rattles on. “Just after the
last revolution I got a specially vised pass-
port from the Mexican consul on the
American side and thought all was clear —
packed up my suitcase and paint gear and
went over the border. It was very early
morning in the border town, and I was
highly amused to see the big police-van
parade the streets and watch the drunks
from the night before being carried out and
thrown into it like sacks of potatoes. Little
did I think that within four hours it would
come for me. I was just finishing a sketch
when two beautifully uniformed policemen
arrived —belts overflowing with guns and
ammunition. One put his hand on my
shoulder. ‘Have you permission to paint
here?’ ‘Yes,’ I answered, and dipped the
paint-brush again. Then he said ‘Show me,’
and I handed him my passport with the
brand new photo. But that didn’t give per-
mission. ‘You must come to the police
station.’ I said ‘How far is it?’ ‘About
two miles.’ ‘And you expect me to walk and
carry all this gear in this heat’ (about
125 deg.). One disappeared and I thought
he was telephoning to the Consul, as I had
suggested; bu-t really he had telephoned
for the police van. So off we went, hell for
leather, a splendid siren blowing and not
stopping for anybody or anything. At the
police station I was put through the third
degree. Then they motored me off to the
Capitol, four miles away. Here I was
brought before the head serang and ques-
tioned for upwards of an hour. They could
find nothing incriminating, so released me,
but kept my drawing.”

CRAIG AND AITKEN, 654 George Street, Sydney
li'PT, P
engines or old Tom’s. He ought to be
berthing at the wharves in town by now.
A frown knitted his brows as he watched
Rahilly’s fumbling clutch at the rope that
was flung down to him. Old Tom on the
booze again! Usually he gave notice when
he felt he was due for a break, so that
someone could take over the work of the
boat, and it was a bad relapse for him to
be drinking on the job; but a glance at
the blotched face and strained eyes as he
came over the rails banished that suspicion
from Lew’s mind. Old Tom was quite
sober.
There w’as an exchange of half-muttered
words as they took the dinghy in tow and
sent the engines ahead at full speed again,
but Lew remained in the bows, a queer
paralysis in his limbs and darkness closing
over hjs mind like the lid of a shutter.
There was that look in Rahilly’s eyes!
Something was approaching that he wanted
to fend off as long as he could. If you
refused to meet trouble half-way.... But
there was no security in that!
“What’s gone crooked now, Tom?” he
asked, when the old man came along the
deck. “Bad news?”
Rahilly felt for the coil of rope as if his
back were stiff.
“Yes, it’s bad,” he admitted. “I had to
come out and meet you, Lew. Been waiting
since late last night in those mangroves.
You haven’t a drop of whisky aboard,
have you?”
Lew remained motionless, as if he hadn’t
heard.
“It’s Peter,” he said, half to himself.
“Yes, it’s Peter,” Rahilly assented. “For
Ciod’s sake, don’t take it too hard, Lew.
These things just happen.”
His mind was a little dulled from want
of sleep, for he had spent one night waiting
in the dinghy among the mangroves and
the one before beating about with a lantern
among the tall grass and potholes of the
paddymelon country. Yet though he had
dreaded this meeting as he had never
dreaded anything before in all his easy-
going days, he had kept his will steadily set
to it like a compass to a pole. They had
all agreed that he was the man to break the
news to Lew: even Lena had pleaded with
him to go down and meet the boat. She
couldn’t face the thought of Lew coming
home unprepared. And so he sat on the
coil of rope, looking at Lew with side-long
glances and rummaging in his mind for
words that would take some of the harsh-
ness out of what he had to tell.
“We didn’t start looking for him till his
mother came home,” he was saying. “I
was busy loading the boat and didn’t notice,
and young Milly—she thought he was with
his mother. But if we’d got out earlier it
would have been just the same. There was
none of us could have picked up his tracks
in that rough paddymelon country, and
the grass was so high a bullock wouldn’t
have showed above it.”
Still and straight as a rooted pine Lew
stood on the deck, staring down at Rahilly’s
blotched face, his body rigid, an unnatural
fixity in his eyes. It was almost as if he
had lost power to feel or think. Once or
twice his lips moved, but no sound came
from them. Rahilly’s fumbling voice went
on and on; every man and child in the
place had been out that night, searching
for Peter with lanterns. The Wiegerts and
old Kunkel had stripped the bells off
their cows and they had criss-crossed over
the paddymelon country till daylight,
within sound of one another. But they
hadn’t found Peter till some time after sun-
rise, and then by the merest fluke. He was
lying head downwards in a grass-covered
pothole of water, just as he had fallen.
“Too knocked out to make a struggle,”
said Rahilly. “It must have happened just
before daylight Wonderful the heart
he had in him to keep going all that time.”
A queer sound came from Lew’s throat,
and he turned abruptly and went to the
little cabin. He was still there, lying face
downwards on the bunk when the boat
edged in to the jetty, and he did not stir
even when the ropes were thrown ashore
and the men came on to shift the deck
cargo.
“Keep off,” Rahilly told them. “Time to
start unloading when he’s gone.”
There were women moving about the
house, a few cars drawn up outside the
paling fence, an atmosphere of hushed
voices and desultory coming and going.
Lena’s brother and his wife had driven
over from Glenrowan, and Dora Wiegert
had taken charge of the kitchen. But Lena
herself spoke to none of them: she had
retired to her bedroom and drawn down
the blinds. It was only when she saw
Rahilly talking to Dave Wiegert outside
the fence that she came to the window and
beckoned him over.
“You told him, Tom?” she asked in a
throaty whisper.
“Yes, I told him.”
“And where is he now?”
“Down there in the boat. I don’t think
lie knows it’s at the jetty yet.”
Lena straightened herself and threw a
wrap over her shoulders.
“Then I’ll go down to him there.”
Rahilly looked uneasy.
“Better not,” he advised. “When a man
gets a knock like that There isn’t any-
thing you can do but let him alone.”
He went floating off as if he were eager
to find something to do with his hands.
Not by a word or a flash of the eyes ha<
Lew asked him where Lena had gone tha
day, and yet he had an instinct that hk
old mate knew. He would have lied about
it cheerfully, if necessary, not for Lena’'
sake but for Lew’s. Yet would it be worth
while, after all? Men had a knack ol
soaking the truth in through their pore,
in cases like this, and the least said tin
soonest mended! Going down to the break-
water he sat watching his loaded boat that
was anchored out in mid-channel, wondering
how long it w T ould be before he could
decently get it moving down the Passage
again.
There was nothing they could do for Lev
but let him alone! That seemed to be thi
feeling of the crowd of men and women a."
they drifted out of his way when he left the
cabin and came up to the house, walking
as stiffly as if he were blind, yet going
straight to the room where Peter lay am
shutting the door behind him. The women
were whispering in the passages. Was the
funeral to be that afternoon, or in the
morning? The Wiegerts had already dug
the grave in the new cemetery at Lavinia
and the casket would be arriving at any
minute from the township.
But though they approached Lena through
her brother, they could get no definite
answer from her. She was waiting to ask
Lew, and Lew was locked in the room
where the small form lay wrapped in a sheet
He came out at last and went down to the
dinghy that was still moored to the stern
of the boat, a queer deliberateness in all
his actions as he unfastened the boat and
selected a piece of canvas from the shed
near the jetty. Except for a couple of words
exchanged with Lena in the passage he had
not spoken to anyone since he heard the
news. A great dumbness lay on him, and
his face had the solemn absorption of a
child’s: for the time being the world
around didn’t exist for him, the men moving
quietly over the deck shifting the cargo
that was immediately needed, the handful
of people talking by the paling fence, the
cars stealthily coming and going. Leaden
weights! From the shed he carried them
down and placed them in the bottom of the
dinghy.
He looked up suddenly and saw Lena
standing on the embankment above him, a
touch of hysteria about her mouth and
swollen eyes.
“Lew!”
“Well?”
“Aren’t you coming up? They’re all
waiting Don’t make things harder by
keeping to yourself, Lew. God knows I’ve
been on the rack as much as you have.”
He stared at her unseeingly.
“What do you want me to do?”
“Come up and see to things. It’s you
who ought to make the arrangements—not
me.”
“I’m making them,” he saidj quietly.
“Send all those people away. Peter’s coming
with me.”
She came down the breakwater and faced
him.
“Going with you? What in God’s name
do you mean, Lew?”
“Just what I say Peter’s coming with
me. Out over the bar.”
She flinched from the look in his glazed
eyes. For a moment her impulse was to
fling herself down at his feet, clasp his
knees, plead with him to be sensible; but
the feeling that his face was strange to her
and that his still body was 'being moved
by a tide he himself couldn’t control
sharpened an abhorrence in her that was
both mental and physical. Those blind
eyes that were so wide open!
“You’re mad!” she said passionately.
“Mad!”
There was an hysterical intensity in her
face. Something leapt from the dark still
ness of his mind, but he checked it before
it found utterance.
“Perhaps I am We’ll let it go at that,
Lena.”
He watched her straggle back over the
stretch of green toward the house, and then
turned to the boat again. So profound was j
the emotion that guided him that he didn’t
feel it necessary to justify himself to Lena
or anyone else. That new cemetery near
the Lavinia golf-course, with its post-and-
rail fence and two crosses of painted wood:
no, Peter couldn’t be shoved into a box
of varnished pine and left there! Peter
was coming out with him on a last journey
across the bar. Slapping of the waves
against the bottom of the boat, sea-birds’
cries, the two of them intimately alone on
the gently-heaving waste beyond the reef!
While the others watched him as if he
were a man possessed he carried the small
canvas-covered body down to the dinghy
and rowed out towards the open sea.

The Crossing.
My train and your tram meet
Where the level crossing is;
You and your legs go that way,
I and my hump go this.
What a dainty piece,
What life in your eye!
What a petal of a frock.
Glimpsed as we go by !
Now you are gone for ever;
The world empty is.
You and your legs go that way,
I and my hump this.

AS WE SAID BEFORE
This Page will be devoted week by week to reproductions of the

century, so that pleasant memories may be revived in old readers and
a new generation may enjoy the things that delighted an earlier one.
A lady ten feet round the waist is on
view just now in New York. Now just sup-
pose a man won that lady’s affections and
wanted to take her in his arms, would it
be advisable to squeeze her by putting a rope
round her and hauling on the two ends of it,
or should he do it by walking rapidly round
her, and leaning up against her as he went,
or would it be better to shove her into a
“How did this hair come on your coat, dear?”
“Oh! I suppose it’s off the dog.”
“Nonsense, George. Flossie’s not a blonde.”
corner and squeeze her against the wall?
And supposing a fellow proposed to her, and
she threw herself into his arms, ought he
to jump aside and let her flop over on the
floor, or should he rush at her when she
first begins to go off the perpendicular, and
try to heave her back into an upright posi-
tion? The Bulletin wants to know.
I [Sappho Smith] wonder if the plain
woman ever reflects that the silver lining of
her affliction is the fact that she gets on
with her own sex ever so much better than
the pretty woman can ever hope to do, for
a pretty woman generally finds all the other
women absolute hedgehogs, so far as she is
concerned. But the ugly woman is wel-
corned with open arms; there is no delay in
introducing the. most special young men to
she is praised (in a poor thing’ sort
? i_ ™.ay) to ; 10r f ace and behind it. She
a clear creature because she isn’t dangerous.
Then she is the first favorite with mamma,
because she sets off dear Gertie so, and with
dear Gertie, who is fully aware of such a
foil, so the “ugly duckling” generally has
a velvety time among women who never
whisper that “her color isn’t her own,’
because she' hasn’t any, nor hint that “her
figure comes from everywhere,” because she
has none. Women are genuine enough, too,
in their, patronising attention to. the non-
Venuses ; but if any of the eligible men show
serious attention to one of these, behold!
the end of all things.
It was in the good old times on the
Edwards River that a jackeroo—whose pa
was a- baronet, by ,Jove! and who liad been
accustomed to have his horses looked after
by a groom, don’t you know—arrived on one
of the stations. He was sent on a message
to another station, and given one of the best
horses on the place, with orders to take great
care of his mount. He got to his destination
all right, and next morning, when the horses
were brought in, he went with the rest to
the stockyard to catch his horse. Arrived
there, his eye wandered hopelessly over the
mixed mob of animals, and at last be diffi-
dently got down off the fence a*nd proceeded
to catch a horse, which, by some accident,
chanced to be his own. The boss had seen
his vacant stare, so he determined to try
and “take a rise out of him.” “Hi!” said
he, “what arc you catching that horse for?”
“Isn’t he my horse?” gasped the newchum.
“Your horse!” said
the boss, with sar-
casm in his tone.
“They never owned
a horse like that
one on the station
you come from.
Your horse don’t
appear to be in the
yard ; he must have
got away.” “Heav-
ens! What shall I
do ?” said the
other; “they told
me to take such
care of him.”
“Well,” said the
boss, “I’ll send
after him, arid I
will lend you that
horse to go home
on, but you’ll have
to Sign an agree-
ment to return that
animal or £5O with-
in a week, because
I can see you ain’t
a man to be trust-
ed with a valuable
horse.” The new-
chum accepted
those terms, and
rode home .sadly,
having borrowed
his own horse and
agreed to forfeit
£5O if he didn’t
give him back in
a week. It was the
same innocent who
bought a mare very
poor, and turned
her out in a pad-
dock for a couple
of years, at the
end of which time
he found what
he believed to be
a strange mare,
very fat, with a yearling colt and a
foal at foot running in the paddock,
and filled with indignation at such tress-
passers, he pounded the lot. No one
turned up to claim them, so they were sold
out of the pound, and the newenum bought
them, after a spirited competition with a
little Irish horse-dealer, for £l5. It was
his own mare with two of her progeny.
A Sydney gentleman who had carefully
trained up his servant in the way he should
go sent him with the box-ticket for the
theatre to the house of a young lady. The
servant returned while the gentleman and
his wife were at dinner. “Did you see him P”
said the gentleman, giving him the cue. “Yes,
sir,” replied the servant; “he said he'd go
with a great deal of pleasure, and that he’d
wait for you, sir.” “What was he doing?”
asked the wife carelessly. “Putting on his
bonnet, ma’am.”
It was on the Barcoo, in the rousing old
days of big cheques and bigger sprees, when
a veteran shepherd on a certain station, in
running round a mob of ewes and lambs to
force them into a yard close to the boss’s
homestead, dropped dead in his tracks. The
squatter, a regular
colonial - experience
man fresh from an
English university,
knew as much of
the law as one of
Inglis’s J’s.P., and
had the old hand
shovelled into a
deep grave on a
sandhill hard by
without the sem-
blance of a prayer
or a wake. The
wheels of justice
often got bogged
in those days, and
consequently i t
was many Suudays
after when the
mounted-police ser-
geant and his full
private drew rein
at the homestead
verandah, and were
warmly greeted by
the boss and a stiff
glass of rum. “Any-
thing up?” asked
the squatter. “No-
thing,” replied the
sergeant; “only
we’ve come to see
about that old man
of yours that
pegged out lately.”
“Why. what about
him?” “Nothing,
only I’ve got to dig
him up and hold
an inquest as to
the cause of
death.” “The cause
of death,” exclaim-
ed the squatter.
“Why you don’t think we've killed him?”
“Oh dear no, only the law requires it. That's
all.” “Then I’ll see you d—-d before I
let you dig up that old man,” was the reply.
After a strong remonstrance the sergeant
caved in, well aware that his chief and the
squatter were pretty “thick.” Next morning
the members of the force rode homeward to
concoct the best report they could. Months
after the squatter, on his way to town for
supplies, dropped in to have a yarn with
the district police inspector. They chatted
cordially, until at length the officer asked:
“What was it, by-the-bye, that made you
so infernally rusty about raising that old
man of yours?” “Oh, a likely thing I
was going to have that old joker dug up!
He had a cheque of mine for £35 in his
trousers pocket.”
On leaving Sydney Phil May went to
Rome, intending to devote himself to paint-
ing, but was much disappointed with Italian
art —so much so that he resolved to go on
at once to Paris. “I cannot understand how
fellows working in a place so full of senti-
ment as Rome should be content to limit
themselves to daubing smirking peasant-
girls and dirty loafers. Those horrid things
stare you in the face in every shop window.
There seems to be no end of them, and all
appear to be taken from the same model.
The pictures, if one may call them so, are
absolutely devoid of meaning. I am told
they are the work of students. Mrs. May is
progressing favorably with her Italian. I
wish I were; I get into all sorts of messes.
I generally look up Baedeker before going
out, and try and learn by heart what 1
want to ask for, but I generally remember
the wrong thing. I asked a cabby for some
soap the other day. I believe he thought 1
was mad.”
Dear Bulletin, —A Christmas party given
by a “cove” on a certain backblocks station
was attended by a fine specimen of the young
Australian “bushy,” who, while all there at
a muster, was quite at sea in a ballroom.
Noticing his backwardness, a sprightly young
lady from a neighboring run took a kindly
interest in him, and even succeeded in get-
ting him to scramble through a quadrille.
He fell desperately in love with her at once,
and the hostess kept up her end of the fun
so well that the Cornstalk felt he might
make a capture if he played his card
cautiously. On leaving for home the lady
forgot her dancing-shoes, and the hostess
asked the young Ldchinvar from the plains
if he would oblige by returning them. “Will
a duck swim?” was the reply, as the delighted
youth sprang on his horse and flew to the
home of his soul’s adored. The lady was
surprised to see him, but tendered a friendly
greeting, and then her enraptured admirer
blurted out: “You forgot yer darncin’-shoes
last night, Miss, so I’ve fetched you the
parcel.” Ilis enslaver thanked him with a
smile that nearly lifted him out of his knee
boots, but. on opening the package, ex-
claimed : “Why, there’s only one shoe here!”
“Yes,” stammered the blushing bushy, “but
I’ll bring yer tli’ other one round to-morrer;
an’ look ’ere, Miss” (most passionately),
“I wish to Gord you was a santipede, so
as I could bring you a shoe every day for
the next six months!”

THE RIVER AND THE WIND.
This is the strain the river sang
As it hurried to the sea,
Far from the city’s din and clang:
“Come weary soul to me.
“The world is cruel, false, and wrong,
Shall it still torture thee?
Thy life is young, the years are long,
There is deep rest in me.”
Uprose the wind to hush the song,
The stream still called to me:
“Thy life is young, the years are long,
There is deep rest in me.”
O wond’rous wind, O kindly wind,
O wind that sang to me:
“Live bravely on, if love you find,
The world has bliss for thee.”
O wind and stream ! O dear old spot!
They say that you are dumb;
I’ve lived in vain, for love came not,
So, wind and stream, I come.
And, wind, I’ll wait to hear the strain
I erstwhile heard from thee,
If not, O stream, but sing again,
“There is deep rest in me.”
A. C. FONTAINE.
THE GREAT INEVITABLE.
Young Kitty was a dashing maid,
So witty, bright and “snappy.”
Enough of ankle she displayed
To make the strollers happy.
I used to like to take her out- — -
We sometimes had a carriage:
But though she tried to hook her trout
I wasn’t “on” for marriage.
I often dined with her mama
(A pleasant home the gal had) ;
Then Kit would bring a good cigar
And sing a touching ballad.
One couldn’t help but like her way,
For chaps are only human ;
Till ten or twelve I’d often stay
And ogle that young woman.
She’d pinch my cheek and call me “flirt” ;
I shrank from pointed prattle—
Wives may sew buttons on your shirt,
But yet they’re kittle-cattle.
’Tis best to live in single bliss,
In lodging snug and shady;
I did not mean to ask my miss
To be a married lady.
This good resolve I tried to keep
(You see, she hadn’t brothers),
But O, alas ! I fell asleep
One night at Kitty’s mother’s.
’Twas just the chance a woman loves;
She had been w r ont to joke me,
And say she’d “win a pair of gloves”—
Her fond caress awoke me.
I scarce had left the land o’ dreams
Where facts and fancies mingle ;
A kiss at such a moment seems
To make your fingers tingle.
The figure bending o’er my chair
Looked tempting, plump and cosy,
There came a perfume from her hair
As from a summer posy.
I saw a pair of laughing eyes.
A neck as white as lilies,
I seized her hand (the smallest size)
And vowed, like other sillies,
That she was all the world to me—•
The rest is easy guessing.
The maiden sat upon my knee
Whilst Ma bestowed her blessing.
As Adam found before the Fall,.
There’s One above disposes
The destiny of each and all,
Though foolish man proposes.
I lull our baby on my lap
To slumber with this ditty:
My cards are played, I took a nap —
And so I’ve taken Kitty.

A curse on the man who first invented
Christmas picnics. Another and an especi-
ally hot curse on the individual who first
designated Christmas a “festive” season,
when he knew all the time that it was about
as festive as the open smile of a skeleton.
Ten years ago we went to one of these de-
ceiving entertainments in the far and arid
North, where the sun tends strictly to busi-
ness in the dog-days, and where every dog
has his day, and very few of the days are fit
for a dog to be out in, A listless party sat
round on the sands and on some bull-ants.
We were not then the elevated individual
we have since become, and we sat with
the rest to wolf the ham and drink tea out
of a pannikin. Then we discovered that
there was no water, and, consequently, there
could be no tea. So the ham was eaten dry,
and, with our tongues hanging out of our
mouths, we went forth to look for water.
Among us we covered an aggregate distance
of 54 miles, and found not so much as a
drop, and an attempt to quench our feelings
by licking a gum-tree proved futile. So,
under a blazing afternoon sun, our party
tottered home, and finished a festive Christ-
mas clutching the filter. Years have rolled
on since then, but we have never faced a
picnic since, and we have fixed up a large
red affidavit that, unless there is a Moses
in the party to strike the rock, we never will.
A zealous and efficient dogman wa<s
grievously imposed upon the other day in a
Victorian township by a soulless clod of a
UNIMPEACHABLE EVIDENCE.
“We have mosquitoes up country as big as rabbits.”
“Oh, yes. I saw some wire-netting going up the other day. I
suppose it was for skeeter-curtains.”
market-gardening party who can’t even write
his own ignoble cognomen. The dogman’s
duty is to hustle after mendicant canines
and pursue them with velocity and dispatch
until they are overtaken and captured, after
which he dips them in a well until their
souls take flight; he also collects registration
fees, and has the law upon the harborers of
illegitimate poodles. This particular canine
constable is a proud, cold man with a
piercing black eye and a pile of stupendous
cheek. The market-gardener called him
“Doggy” in the street, and derided his calling,
and consequently he loathed the cultivator of
greens, and laid for him at every possible
opportunity. At night he turned stray dogs
into his garden, and in the morning went
along to have him fined, but the market-
gardener sat up late at night and heaved
the dogs out, and the constable missed him
every time. But at last the soul of the dog-
man sang for joy, for he observed a* large
brown retriever tied to a stump in the hos-
tile back yard, and he pounded at the door
and howled for admittance. “Is that there
dorg registered?” lie demanded sternly.
“Naw.” “You’ll have to register it.” “Naw.”
“But I’ll make you.” “Go and bust.” “I’ll
summons you.” “See you d—d first.
“Looky ’ere, you’ll be fined.” “Go it, Doggy,
gee up, and be” (to be continued in
our next). The local pup-annihilator fled
down the street like a cyclone and took out
the summons, and the case came on for hear-
ing. “Josiah Perkins, yer charged wid
harborin’ an unregistered dorg,” said the
Bench, “I are, yer Washup,” said the defen-
dant, “an’ the dorg’s in court. _ P’raps ye
might like to have a* look at him.” Here
Josiah hauled the dog from under a seat
and dumped it down “forninst” the Bench.
It was stuffed. A wild promiscuous game
had been put up on the dog-paralyser, and
after throwing upwards of 80 stray curs over
Perkins’s fence he had been trapped into
suing for a stuffed canine. Collapse—general
row—gall and wormwood —voice in the
court heard to say audibly “Damn.”
In Freetrade England women are paid
a penny a thousaiid for cutting out and
making paper bags of assorted sizes. Match-
boxes are paid for [lBSB] at the rate of
twopence farthing per gross, the women who
make them at that price finding their own
paste. Good cabinet-makers are rather
better paid. By working about 15 hours a
day every day in the week they sometimes
make as much as Bs. 9d. for 105 hours’
work. But it is not every workman who
can rake in that sum, and none of them can
do it every week.
A meditative Chinaman is talking to him-
self as lie irons a shirt. Picks up a shirt
showing evidence of having been well cared
for, and says: “Bachelor; him landlady
fix him.” Picks up another, buttonless and
all frayed at the wrists and neck, and says:
“Mallied man.”
It was a summer morning in a pleasant
up-country township in N. S. Wales. The
sun shone brightly from a cloudless sky;
the dew sparkled on the grass, the air was
loaded with dajsy-scents and the sweet odor
of the violet, and the gladsome cornstalks
swore in the gutter. A dead cat lay in the
middle of the roadway. It was a small tor-
toiseshell animal, and when people looked
at it they felt sorry for its untimely fate. Ail
that day it remained there, and towards
evening a cart went over its head and
squashed it flat. Then somebody kicked it,
and a horse stepped on its tail. Next morn-
ing a little girl found it, and played with
it for a while till her mother slapped her
little ear and threw the cat into the gutter.
A boy wrapped it up in paper, and left it at
the house of a policeman, who, when he found
out what was in the package, swore and
threw it back into the street, where it lay
till nightfall. Then somebody shied it in at
an open bedroom window, and, a little later
on, a sweet grey-eyed girl in a nightdress
took it up by the tail and cast it forth with
curses. It rose again on the third day, when
an omnibus stove it in, and, as the sultry
afternoon wore on, a larrikin discharged a
flattened, mutilated, evil-smelling object into
the local bank and hit the accountant on the
back of the head. The bill-clerk chased him
for half a mile, and the messenger put the
mouldy relic of the cat out in the kennel
by the aid of a pair of tougs. A drunken
man sat on it
shortly afterwards,
and had to be disin-
fected before he
c o ul d re-enter
society. There was a
political meeting that
night, and just as
an eloquent speaker
demanded to know
what could be more
corrupt than the
policy of Protection,
the cat landed on the
desk in front of him,
a miserable wreck,
with' two legs, no
head, and a vanished
tail. Then the Ma*yor,
who was in the chair,
audibly ordered
Policeman O’Rafferty
to take the beastly
thing out and bury
it, and his order was
attended to by the
shuddering constable.
Or, at least, he said
it was, a<nd Police-
man O’Doolan backed
him up, but next
night the Mayor
had a party, and a
hideous object all
claws and decay
car&e down the chim-
ney, and scattered
the fire in all direc-
tions. It was the
ca-t. It was thrown
out for the twen-
tieth time, and no-
thing more was
heard of it till one
ear turned up in the
parson’s water supply. And yet they say
that sanitary laws are carefully attended to
in N. S. Wales.
In a country town up north there is a
widowed squatteress. Her staff of servants
consists of one whaler, who works for his
tucker, as the lady is poor. Poverty does
not prevent pride, however, so O’Doherty
was ordered to call the squatteress’s young
hopefuls “Master Tom” and “Master Jack.”
This is how he addresses them: “Hi, you,
Master Tom with no shoes, and Master
Jack with the patched trousers, come to
tea!”
The other evening a bank manager at
Toorak gave a dinner party, and among the
guests were another bank manager, & parson,
a building-society director and a sharebroker.
They were smoking cigars and passing round
the flowing bowl, and having a high old time
generally on some of the proceeds of the
land boom, when suddenly the host’s small
boy gave a yell of delight from his seat
beside the window, and vociferated “Oh, pa,
there’s a p’liceman coming in at our gate!”
Then a sudden coldness fell upon the company
•—'all except the parson. The host nervously
put the lighted end of his cigar in his mouth
and swallowed nearly a foot of hot ashes;
then he seized a small dog off an adjacent
chair and tried to pour it into his glass. The
other bank manager turned gkastlv pale and
hurriedly put his burning cigar in his
pocket, and solemnly emptied a whole
decanter of port on ‘the tablecloth. The
sharebroker rose suddenly to his feet and
made an unaccountable break for the door,
but when he was
half-way across the
room he seemed to
recollect himself
and came back in
a n embarrassed
sort of a way, and
sat down, but
missed his chair
and lighted on the
floor instead. No
one seemed to
notice him, how-
ever. The build-
ing-society man
seemed all at once
to lose the thread
of the anecdote he
was telling, and
b ega n to make
strange and un-
accountable asser-
tions. “It 'wasn't
the influenza, after
all, as it happen-
ed,” he said husk-
ily, “only a police-
man—l mean only
a cold, so I put
my head in gruel
and I mean I
drank the bed and
sat down in the
gruel—that is, I
ate a porous plas-
ter, of course, and
put my feet in the
bank as security,
and deposited the
gruel to my credit,
and next morning
I awoke in prison
—-in perspiration, I
mean.” Just here
the other bank-
manager began to
combust visibly
owing to the cigar
in his pocket, but
no one paid any
attention at all.
Then the boy at
the window sud-
dcn 1 y screamed
again: “Oh, Pa,
it isn’t a police-
man ; it’s only a
postman!” and ail
at once the four
men woke as if
from a horrid
dream, and the
sharebroker arose
from the floor,
and the burning
banker extinguished himself, and the host
gave up crowding the dog into his glass, and
there was a great calm. But they all
looked sideways at the parson, and the parson
looked hard at the roof.
There is an old lady in Melbourne just
now who doesn’t feel well, and her two
daughters are also indisposed. Her son,
Dick, however, a shock-headed youth of 16,
continues to enjoy good health, and riots
round while the rest of the family are pining
away in bed, and stating that they will never,
never enjoy their food any more. They live
in a high-toned suburb and move in sassiety,
but privately they have been accustomed to
take stand-up meals in the kitchen, and
the young ladies forage round in petticoats
and curl papers and do the cooking them-
selves. A leg of mutton lasts long enough
in that household to become ancient history,
and the butter is a cheap article with hairs
on it. Consequently it is a gala occasion
when the unwholesome-looking son and heir
comes in at the back door with a quantity
of fish, and when he arrived the other day
with an immense package of eels, Emily
Victoria Florence, who is scraggy apd
stunted through continual slim diet, had the
first square meal she had enjoyed for a
month, and Gladys Ethel Maude was filled
to repletion, but Dick himself held aloof
from the bill of fare and when the fish was
all picked clean he mentioned casually that
a dead man had been hauled out of the Yarra
that morning, and when he was landed and
shaken, the eels —the rest of the story is
too awful to tell. Emily Victoria went into
fits in the back yard on hearing it, and
Gladys Ethel Maude, was with an
inward pain in the wash-house. When they
recovered a little the whole family put a
notice on the door that they had gone for
a prolonged tour in Yurrup, and then they
crawled feebly to bed. They have now been
in bed a week, and are still suffering. Once
a day or so a dishevelled girl creeps down-
stairs in a long white garment, and collars
a hunk of stale bread to avert starvation or
catalepsy, and Dick keeps himself alive by
boiling eggs over a candle, or tries to fry
a scraggy chop in boot varnish. When his
mother tries to get up he hollers “Eels!” at
her doorway, and then she goes into hysterics
and drums on the floor with her feet. The
family are now so thin that they can count
their bones, and while they are thus pros-
trated by calamity the heir smokes bad
cigars in the drawing-room, and aggravates
their sufferings by keeping a horrid dog
which yaps ali day in the yard.
There is in a small Victorian township a
young unwed preacher of the gospel named
Mackerel. Mothers of marriageable daugh-
ters down there ostentatiously rattle six
coppers into the plate every time and
murmur, “A sprat to catch a Mackerel.”
A controversy is going on in one of the
Melbourne papers as to what sort of girl
the young man of to-day wants for a wife.
The answer might have been given m one
sentence —the young man of to-day wants for
a wife a girl who will support him. There
it. is. Since women have taken to be mascu-
line' the rising generation of males have
no choice but to be feminine. The reign
of female beauty is nearly over. Men (ol
the higher classes) will in themot-far-distant
future take to wearing i 7 cils to preserve
their complexion, and will occupy as long
over their toilet as women do now. Some
such conversation as the following will be
of common occurrence then. Scene: A
drawing-room in South Yarra. Mrs. Fitz-
biffin (the lady of the house) and her friend
Mrs. de Toohey (who has called for her
to go to the theatre) discovered waiting
CLERICAL SABBATARIANISM.
“Archbishop Benson, of Canterbury, is a warm advocate for the use of
bicycles among the clergy, and adds that he would willingly lend his inffu-
ence to a society for providing impecunious ministers with ‘the steeds of
iron.”
CLERGYMAN (on his way to church ): “Ah! Yonder comes a
youth on a bicycle for mere 'pleasure. I suppose I must
remonstrate with him for Sabbath-breaking.”
impatiently, Mrs. Fitzbiffin loquitur: “I’m
so sorry to keep you waiting, Mrs. de
Toohey, but Tomkins has not finished dress-
ing yet—you know what men are, dear. I
promised the poor fellow I would take him
to the theatre the first night I could spare,
and of course you know it would _ be im-
proper to allow him to go by himself —
without protection.” Or this in a lower
grade of life. Scene: A back yard in Colling-
wood. Mrs. Mugglesby, armed with a wood-
axe, chasing her husband around the yard.
Mrs. M. loquitur: “Take that! And that!
You lazy, loafing, good-for-nothing, slatternly
wretch. I come home from my hard day's
work and find you gossiping with Gribbles—
another precious article for a woman to
have to keep—instead of getting my dinner
ready. And smoking my pipp, tooj _ I
shouldn’t wonder if you’d take to drinking
beer next. Ugh! I’ll knock such nonsense
out of you, if I have to kill you. Do you
hear that? That’s your friend Gribbles
getting his lot. Mrs. Gribbles is not the
woman to stand such capers—nor am P.
We’ll teach the pair of you.” More thrash-
ing with the axe-handle, and then in an
agony of terror Mugglesby runs into the
next yard and claims the protection of Mrs.
Gribbles, just as Gribbles is diving into the
Mugglesby yard to ask Mrs. Mugglesby
to shield him. The two ladies confront each
other and a battle-royal ensues, the husbands
looking on with frightened faces. The com-
batants then make up and send their hus-
bands for beer to cement the treaty of
peace. They are left drinking it while the
wretched husbands, fearful of what their
wives may do to them when the beer gets
into their heads, sneak away to an empty
shed and mingle their sorrows > together.
The papers in these days will bristle with
such headings as the following: “A Brutal
Husband-beater,” “Barbarity of a Wife,”
“A Husband Starved by His Wife,” “An
Epidemic of Husband-beating,” “Six Months
for Gouging out Her Husband’s Eyes—a
Warning to the Female Ruffians.And so
forth. It will be a merry time —for single men.
THE DREAM MAIDEN.
The sunbeams ride the dimpled sea,
Glint through the glade,
And dancing o’er the dewy lea
Begem each blade.
The Morn is up. Where is my Love?
Fled with the night!
Oh, wherefore flown so soon, fond dove?
Where ta’en thy flight?
Dear Love, why only visit me
In slumbrous hour?
Art but a dream, a reverie,
A midnight flower,
A fairy roamer that must shun
The light of day,
And ’fore the fervor of the sun
Fade quite away?
My only Love, so sweetly fair,
Does Fancy paint
A being all too pure to bear
The earthly taint?
I trust not, yet we two may meet,
Should Fate be kind ;
Till then within this bosom, sweet,
Dwell saint enshrined !

That Girl of Jackson's.
THIS IS THE MOST STRIKING OF THE MSS. WHICH
DAVID McKEE
WRIGHT
LEFT UNPUBLISHED AT HIS DEATH. THE STORY IS BASED
ON A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THE WRITER’S MISS! ON ARY DAYS.
LIKE a great pink tourmaline breaks
the morning on the snowtops. Only
the sky is a thin, pale blue, shading
off into a rosy grey where it meets the line
of the hills. The snow is over everything.
The little gullies that were rugged scars
in the rounded slopes of the yellow hills
when the short, hot summer was on the
high country are now only undulations and
broad curves in the great cold, pink carpet
that covers the world. Last week the snow
drifted before light winds that slowly swept
it like powdery dust from place to place
in an effort to make all things level to the
eye. The frost came and stopped that pretty
play; caught the little wind in the middle
of its game and bound crystal to crystal
and drift to drift until a depth of twelve
feet of the pent and bound whiteness would
carry the weight of a man, whose boots
would scarcely scar the hard, slippery sur-
face. They had ten degrees of frost at
the sheltered Papatoa homestead nestling in
the folds of the ranges three thousand feet
beloAV; what the temperature might have
been here at midnight only the sharpened
stars knew.
Jack Hammond looked out on the pink
desolation from the head of the Meettings
gully and whistled gaily. He did not feel
gay, nor in any way appreciate those rosy
lights and shadows; but he had a habit
of whistling when things went wrong, just
as lie had a habit of laughing when things
went right. Now, as the hard, frosty air
tingled against his face, things were very
much wrong, so wrong that he must rouse
himself to a big effort for the sheer primi-
tive purpose of keeping himself alive.
Where he stood the snow had been cut
back in a broad lane and cross trench, and
stood in white glittering walls about a little
hut of grey stone. The hut was roofed with
deep snow-grass thatch, and the warmth
within had just sufficiently thawed the mois-
ture without to cause it to form long pointed
icicles, which hung like a draping of crystal
from the eaves. The cross trench led to
the peat-stack—a great square pile of sum-
mer-cut fuel which looked intensely black
in the surrounding whiteness. Jack, still
whistling, went to the pile and came back
with an armful of the oblong blocks which
had for days been his protection against the
biting cold.
As he stooped under the doorway the dog
stretched before the hearth lifted his head
with a little friendly whine.
“Get all the warmth you ean, old man,”
Jack said. “We’ve got to find our way in
to the Flamingo to-day or starve.”
Brian waved his red tail softly in answer.
His big, soft eyes followed every move of
his master. He was an unusual type of
clog to find in a prospector’s whare, but
there were a good many other unusual things
in that little space between the fire and
the bunks powdered with the soft dust of
ash which is never absent where a peat fire
burns.
“No use protesting, old man,” Jack went
on; “that girl of Jackson’s can get in every
week with the mail, so it’s up to us. No,
you needn’t whine. We’re not in Gloucester-
shire now, you scamp. It’s nine miles of
hard going on the snow; and if we don’t go
there’s the end of the Hammond family—
or will be when old Thrift finishes. Yes,
sir, you’re not following the fortunes of a
poor gentleman whose name is close up to
an earl’s in Brett; you’re working for a
plain, low-down prospector called Jack whose
mate is on the spree or dead or something.
Working, did I say? You old loafer!
You’re still one of the idle rich, but you’ve
got to walk to-day—nine miles over the
snow, with the track gone the Lord knows
where.”
The big Irish setter rose and shook his
splendid coat. His whole attitude seemed
to say, “Lead on! I’m ready. If you like
to deny your breed I won’t. Wliat’s nine
miles to a gentleman when he’s hungry?’
“Oh, that’s all very well, you old rascal.
You think it’s all a nice game we’re play-
ing. I suppose you fancy when I’m tired
of digging out wash dirt and living on a cold
mountain I’ll go to my banker and say
‘Sirrah, enough! Weigh me out the gold
necessary for my return to the fleshpots
and the kennels!’ Eh? Well, you get it
well into your red head that there isn t any
banker, and that there aren’t any fleshpots
—unless we make them; and, anyhow
He broke off inconsequently. and went
again to the doorway. The habit of saying
things to the dog had grown upon him m
the late days of solitude; but there are some
tilings a man doesn’t say, even to himself
-half-found thoughts too vague for full
expression. What lie did say at last evi-
dently took up the thread of his wandering
meditation some distance from the point
where the one-sided conversation had been
vender if that girl of Jackson’s will
be in to-day?”
The sun had now risen and was stream-
ing over the snowtops, turning the mountain
world from the pink tourmaline to a great
yellow topaz. The sky was paler in tint
than before, and the distance was hazed and
golden. , . .. „
“Come on, Brian, we ve got to tackle it.
Man and dog left the shelter of the little
warm hut, scrambled up the bank of snow
and set out in the direction of the Flamingo
township. „ . , .
Jack knew well enough the risk he was
taking His young strength was far more
than sufficient for the journey; the biting
cold was not so different from that of his
native winters to matter; but almost every
severe season had taken its toll of wan-
derers in the snow —men of seasoned hardi-
hood and experience. Jack had little or
no experience. _ ~
Three weeks before Fred Nnnmo. Jacks
mate and prospecting companion, had gone
to the Flamingo to bring stores. He had
taken the one horse they possessed with linn
and had not yet returned. The snowstorm,
which had come on two days after he left,
might not in itself be sufficient to account
for his failure to return; but the potency
of the Flamingo whisky might account for
that and much more. In fact, anything
might have happened, and the chances were
that it was nothing serious; but the truth
remained that the cupboard was bare in
the little hut at the head of Meettings gully.
Prospectors are as uncertain in their ways
as in their means of livelihood; but Jack
felt no resentment against his mate. On
the contrary, he was grateful to old Fred
for having taken him, a raw newchum, into
mate,ship. It had been his introduction to
a life he liked. They had won a little gold
from the patchy terraces about the Meet-
tings during the spring and summer; and
the long, lazy winter had not been without
its compensations. In plain fact, Jack was
very much in love with his new occupation
and its surroundings. He had measured his
young, strong manhood against the rough,
simple toil by which a man may live with-
out owning a master, and he enjoyed the
experience.
Heading in the direction in which he
believed the Flamingo to lie, Jack made
fair progress for a couple of hours. The
golden haze had thickened about the hill
tops, and the sun, warming the slopes of
snow, had made them slippery on the sur-
face. At first the slides and stumbles seemed
to matter little; it was as the warmth in-
creased that the travelling became very
slow and difficult.
“Two steps to the front and one to the
rear is bad going, old dog.”
By noon it was bad going indeed, but
the certainty that they must now be close
to the Flamingo kept the man in good spirits,
and the dog’s mood was a reflection of his
master’s.
The Flamingo township—a township in
little more than name—was a cluster of
huts which had grown up about a small
quartz mine. Its population consisted of
a few men who worked in the mine, a mine
manager, a couple of dozen prospectors, a
storekeeper and his elderly daughter, the
proprietors of the accommodation-house and
an old man who acted as rouseabout for the
establishment. The accommodation-house,
though licensed and generally known as the
“hotel,” had no architectural pretensions.
It was a low, thatched building with ramb-
ling outhouses flanked by great stacks of
peat. The store was even less significant.
Two small stone cottages—little larger than
the huts of the prospectors—-had been joined
together by a structure of galvanised iron.
The whole was iron-roofed, and had a nar-
row verandah with a stout wooden rail to
which horses could be tied. There were
stables at the back, and a blue sign over
the verandah described it as the “Post Office
Store.” The entire village lay in a wrinkle
of the high range, bleak and wind-swept in
summer, and often snow-bound in winter;
but it formed a kind of local metropolis for
a few score of prospectors on the surround-
ing mountain-tops, who came there to sell
their gold and buy their provisions, and
often held high revel in the little accommo-
dation-house.
To find the Flamingo when the snow had
covered every possible landmark was a task
for one well used to the mountain condi-
tions. In the golden haze of the noon its
rising peat-smoke was completely lost, and
no sound of life came from the narrow lanes
of banked snow between the huts where
men loitered idly and speculated on the
week’s misery of the thaw when it should
arrive to turn their little world into a
temporary morass.
Jack was already pointing his slippery
journey far to the east of his real objec-
tive when the surface of the snow began
to break. At first that slight crumbling
of the frozen crust was a pleasant thing.
It gave the boots a grip and made walking
comparatively easy.
“Come on, Brian. We’ll see the town-
ship over the next ridge, old boy.”
But the improved pace did not last long,
and there was no township over the next
ridge. Jack began to sink knee-deep in the
snow.
Then followed a grim battle with the long,
treacherous white slopes. Only those who
have experienced it can know what that
battle meant. Breathing hard, floundering,
perspiring, Jack was compelled to pause
from sheer exhaustion at the end of each
fifty yards of his progress. The haze over
the hills had deepened, and he was no longer
confident of his direction. What was worse
still, the increasing softness of the snow
made it too dangerous to cross the deeper
drifts, and forced him to steer an irregular
course along the windings of the ridges that
seemed more solid beneath a shallower
carpet of white.
All the afternoon he struggled, and as
the bitter evening fell he knew that he was
lost. The dog knew it also, and whined a
little as he followed closely at his master’s
heels. Somewhere near were lights and
warmth and food, but whether over the low
slopes to the right or to the left he had
no notion. In his doubt he bore away to-
wards the left, but a turn in the other
direction would have served him no better,
for the peat fires that meant safety and
shelter were glowing a couple of miles behind
him. He had passed the Flamingo and was
heading in the direction of Grey Hills at
the foot of the range.
And now one thought alone possessed
him. In spite of his fatigues, in spite of
all the terrible possibilities of to-morrow,
he must keep moving. To attempt to rest
for more than a moment or two would mean
sleep, and sleep would mean death. Over
and over again he told himself this, as if
by sheer repetition to harden his own will.
The stars became intensely bright. The
snow crisped under his feet and then rang,
as he stamped upon it. like hard glass. He
gave up all notion of direction and wandered
from one higher point to another in the hope
of catching &• glimpse of a human habitation.
Even though he had missed the township he
might stumble on a lonely hut—an empty

and deserted but would be some sort of
shelter.
Slowly the bitter hours wore away, though
never had he known a night so long. Often
he had looked at his watch, until the dis-
covery that the moments also crawled made
him resolve not to take it from his pocket
again. Towards dawn the cold became
intense and the need of swift movement
greater. The air, as he walked against it,
seemed to cut like a knife, yet, as the first
grey light filled the sky, hope almost revived.
The smoky greyness changed to the faint
tourmaline pink that he noted the previous
morning. A conviction came to him that he
had been walking in circles through the
night, and was still close to the Flamingo.
Before him lay a long, even slope of snow
ending in a low hummock that appeared to
be the highest point in the landscape. To
reach this became his one great object. It
was perhaps two miles away, and he stumbled
a<s he walked towards it. His mind wandered
a little and it seemed to his half-numbed
brain that it was the dog who stumbled.
“Bear up, old dog,” he said. “Keep your
feet and hang on to yourself. The township
is just over that hill.”
The sun did not rise clearly, but showed
as a red ball through a hea*vy bank of mist.
It took Jack a very long time to reach the
point of the ridge, and when he did so there
was no more to be seen than he had seen
already—another long valley of smooth
white, another low ridge that met the misty
sky.
“Come on, Brian. One more stretch, then
we’re there. Never say die.” The dog
whined softly and followed the zigzag steps
of his master. Jack did not go far. Utter
fatigue had claimed him; but it was not
the numbness of an approaching snow death.
The temperature had risen a little, and the
hard surface caused by the night frost was
already losing its crispness.
“We’re beaten, old dog—beaten. And that
girl of Jackson’s rides in with the mail every
w eek! We’re not much good, old dog, when
a girl can beat us.”
At once a vision came to his mind of the
fresh, fair face of the mail-rider. It did
not occur to his dazed thought that this girl
could read the mountains where she had
been born as he could read the fields of
Gloucestershire.
The dog nestled close to him to comfort
and be comforted.
“It’s no good, old man. We’re too tired
and we’re no good at the game. I wonder
if this is the finish of the Hammonds. Tha*nk
God the mater isn’t alive. This would hurt
her. I wonder if that girl of Jaekson’s
comes in to-day.”
More and more his thoughts wandered;
more and more he babbled; closer and
closer the dog pressed to him. There came
a troubled half-waking sleep—a sleep that
fought against rest and comfort and sought
to revive pain.
Suddenly the dog left his side, ran a few
yards in the snow and yelped joyously.
Jack opened his eyes and the next moment
staggered to his feet.
At a little distance a horse trailed its
bridle in the snow, and coming towards him,
sinking deep at every step, was a girl as
bright of face as any fairy queen of legend
or schoolgirl tale.
Awkwardly Jack walked towards her and
raised his hat. i
“I thought you were lost in the snow,”
she cried, panting from her exertion. “Why,
it’s Mr. Hammond !”
Jack struggled to speak. He had a fine
little speech just ready to say, but it' would
not come to his tongue. He raised his hat
s«gain: and then the snow seemed to stagger
up and meet him. It was cause for mirth
afterwards when she told him that he said
“Excuse me!” as he fell.
But Jack was half-conscious that an arm
was about him and a voice strangely sweet
in his ear. He was going somewhere —he did
not greatly care where, but the trouble of
looking - for the township was over. They
were going a long distance and a horse was
near them. It was a good horse and showed
breeding; Jack was glad of that. After
that two men carried him—he did not know
why. It was good to be carried by mep.
Men were what he had been looking for.
Then they put him in bed —a white bed—
and there was fire in the room. It couldn’t
be Thrifty’s place. Thrifty would have no
fires in the coldest winter.
When Jack opened his eyes the dog was
whining softly at the side of his bed.
“Hello, old man ! What’s happened to us
all? Where are we?”
Then his eyes took in the rough white-
washed stone walls, the inner side of the
thatched roof that served instead of a ceil-
ing and the rude home-made furniture. He
knew the place at a glance and every-
thing came back to him —everything but the
last act in the drama from the moment when
two men were carrying him. lie was in the
Flamingo accommodation-house and he had
had a very close call.
Then the door opened and the girl came
in. It was late afternoon, but she seemed to
bring the brightest essence of all the sunniest
mornings with her. If you were to accept
Jack’s description of her you would have to
accept a lover’s extravagances; but I, who
knew her longer than Jack, would find it
hard to discount anything he might say.
Jessie Jackson was the loveliest thing those
mountains ever saw.
“Well, I’m glad you’re aw - ake at last.”
“Have I slept long?”
“Just a little more than a> full round of
the clock. I’m glad I was in time to find you.”
“I owe you my life.”
“Do you know you were only a hundred
yards from the track and less than a mile
from the township?”
“It might as well have been a thousand
miles if you had not come. I was exhausted
and beaten.”
Then a voice called from another room:
“Don’t forget Mr. Hammond’s letter.”
“Never mind the letter,” said Jack. “Tell
me how you came to find me.”
H'er voice was so sweet in his ear that he
wanted to hear her talk to him for ever.
“Oh, that wasn’t hard. I was coming up
the track slowly. You know how the horses’
hooves ball in the snow. I just managed to
get through by keeping the shoes filled with
mutton fat. But it wasn’t so bad yester-
day ; the week before it was awful. Well.
I couldn’t miss seeing you, could I? You
were all spread out on the snow—and then
your dog barked.”
“I was just thinking of you when you
arrived.”
“Thinking of me?”
“Yes, I often think of you.”
“Oh, don’t talk nonsense! How do you
feel? Are you well enough to get up?”
“Oh, I’m quite well.”
“All right. Get up. Mrs. Hargreaves
and the boys are all waiting to see you.”
She went out of the room and Jack lay
back luxuriously on his pillow for a
moment. Then his hand crept over and
stroked the dog’s red head.
“Brian, old pal, she’s not quite the mater's
style, and I don’t think they’d understand
her in Gloucestershire, but she’s got a lot
better breeding than we have —yes, in spite
of your pedigree,, old man, and all the
brasses in Walton church.”
An hour later .Tack, sitting in a big arm-
chair by the,tire, opened the letter that had
come, by tlie mail. It was from his solicitors
in London ' and statt d briefly that, r as the
uncle he called Thrifty was -dead, he was
now the Earl of Walton. He held the letter
between finger and thumb and looked across
the room at Jessie, who stood talking to j
Mrs. Hargreaves.
“Countess of Walton,” he thought. “No,
it doesn’t fit.”
And he tossed the letter into the glowing
heart of the peat fire.
One Winter’s Night.
The fire died down and flickered into gloom,
The embers dropped apart with noisy din,
And then you moved across the silly room
' And took your violin.
Louie, beside the piano, struck a chord,
You poised your bow, and then I looked
at you ;
Oh, as the quick theme roused, what need
of word
To tell me that you knew!
,Gran in her high old chair sat tall and
straight,
Philip and Di lounged idly by the wall,
And Auntie Fan, crouched o’er her book of
Fate,
Was blind and deaf to all.
What did you play? I know not! This
I know,
Was mingled flaming quest and young
desire,
Till Gran’s sharp voice pierced to me,
through and through,
“Go, Mena, tend the fire!” .
I had not dared to hope much from the
start,
And as I rose and went reluctantly
It seemed as if I wandered to some doom,
And your eyes followed me,
And outside, from the creaking wood-pile old,
I took the rimy logs with fingers chill;
The crusted earth was wan, and frozen cold
The star above the hill.
And nothing was or could be more the
same;
The listening house, the sullen room, felt
drear;
As I knelt down to fan the dying flame
All that I knew was fear.
I shall not dread again her voice, her frown;
I had no longer hope, nor was I brave;
I saw Gran’s curved, lean fingers crumbling
down A
Clay on an open grave.
I never have been warm or glad since then;
I’ve grown more like her, though, since
first I knew
That as the earth she’d sprinkle for amen,
So had she broken you!

The Older People.
Before a man or woman trod
The grass, or looked upon the stars,
At the unuttered word of God
A people broke the. crystal bars
That stand between Is Not and Is,
And breathed the dark and loved the sun,
And knew the Pentecostal kiss j:
Of wind when bright grass-ripples run.
The powers and princes of the air
Leaned from the gold or silver heights
Of cloud, and down the jewelled stair
We call the rainbow rode like knights
To bear them chalices of dew,
And mystic grails of life and death,
And half the wisdom that they knew-
Whispered in shadow, under breath.
They did not fear the Eden snake,
They did not heed the lion’s tread;
Their womenkind in many a lake
Watched each her lovely long-tressed head.
Yes, all the willow-women bent
Through year-long hours where mirrors lay,
And where the marching mountains .'went.
The strong-thewed pine-men met the day.
Their emerald cities lifted walls *
Wherein was silence and not sound,
And ’neath whose midmost blossom-palls
Was the world’s Magic Maiden found.
For th’ immaculate hawthorn gave
Her whiteness to the eyeless air
In a calm, lucent, gold-green cave,
With trembling guardian aspens there.
At the sheer sunward precipice
Green-bearded Merlin dwelt alone,
Nor twining Vivienne could entice
With arms of mist; on granite stone
His knotted, root-like hands were clenched.
And later, timid, to him came
Small man- and woman-things, that blenched
At his dark height, and spoke his name,
And listened for a word of lore
Where he low-whispered, and laid gold
Upon his knees, and then in awe
To the priest-king the tree-words t01d....
But soon our corpse-towns were upbuilt
With the axe-slaughtered forest-dead!
At Christmas, like a'mummy gilt.
One lifts—Christ-wise—a slain, crowned
head.
