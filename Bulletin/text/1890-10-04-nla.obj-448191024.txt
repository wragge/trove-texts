AYER’S PILES are unsurpassed as a
remedy for constipation, biliousness, sick-head-
acbe, dyspepsia, jaundice, and the common
derangements of stomach, liver, and bowels.
They break up colds, mitigate fevers, relieve
gout, rheumatism, and neuralgia, cleanse the
system of malarial poison, and assist in the
formation of pure, ricli blood. These well-
known pills are comjmmuled of the essential
virtues of the best .vegetable cathartics, and
contain neither calomel nor any other deleteri-
ous drug. They may, therefore, be adminis-
tered in all cases where a purgative is needed,
without fear of ill effects. Being sugar-coated,
they are pleasant to take, and their medicinal
strength is preserved for an indefinite period
and in any climate. They should be in every
domestic medicine chest and traveller’s satchel.

SUFFERING FROM
BRAIN & SERVE EXHAUSTION.
Any man who in his youth has trifled away hia vigour
of bodv, mind, and manhood, should consult PRO-
FESSOR CARL STINE WAY, the Eminent Specialist
in diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs, who is still
treating with the greatest skill and success all Private,
Nervous, and Chronic Diseases.
Professor STINEWAY’S great success, which has
become so firmly established throughout Australasia,
is based upon the facts; - Ist. That every case treated,
even in its most remote effects, is specially studied,
thus starting aright. 2nd. The Medicines and Electric
Appliances used are exactly adapted to suit the case,'
thus promptly producing .results without overdosing
or injury.
I SEEK CASES WHERE ALL ELSE HAS FAILED.
Young and middle-aged men and others, who
suffer from Nervous and Physical Debility,
Exhausted Vitality, Premature Decline, Nc., can
recover the same degree of health, strength,
and energy experienced in former years, by
consulting (in rerson or by letter, which is free).
Professor CARL STINEWAY, who has restored
thousands of sufferers to vigorous manhood
after all other treatment had faded. It makes
no difference what you have taken, or who has
failed to cure you. Cases that I accept for treat-
ment are quickly and permanently cured,
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION: —Are you a sufferer
from bad health in any of its many forms, consequent
on a lingering Nervous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease ? Do you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,
timid, and lack the, pow nof will and action ? Are
you subject to loss of memory ; have spells of faint-
ing ; fullness of blood n the head; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
fits of melancholy ? Are your kidneys, stomach,
urinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition ? Do you suffer from Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
or other aches and pains? Are you timid, nervous,
and forgetful, with your mind continually dwelling
on the subject? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
and energy for business pursuits? Are you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation of
the heart, bashfulness, confusion of ideas, aversion
to society, dizziness in the head, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms? If you are afflicted, why further neglect
your health or future happiness, when by a single
consultation (which costs nothing) you can be placed
on the way to health strength, and vigour?

Western Australia is a much richer colony than is
generally supposed as regards minerals, agriculture and
pastoral ism.—Sir Samuel Griffith.
Professor Brown, of Victoria, who made a thorough
examination of the south-western portion of Western
Australia, states that not the other colonies only hut
even the people of Western Australia evidently do not
Know how much there is waiting for development. He
saw thousands of acres in contiguous blocks of fine choco-
late lands, light clay loams, and peaty soils. He thinks
the important features of the district are its grand climate
and regular rainfall.

SPECIAL MEDICAL NOTICE.
Dr. G. H. RAYMOND,
The Eminent
Botanic Physician, Specialist X Medical Writer,
Has commenced Practice in Sydney, after a residence of
four years in Queensland, twelve months in Western Aus-
tralia, nearly three years in South Australia, and eighteen
months in the City of Melbourne.
The latter place Mr. Raymond was compelled to abandon
in consequence of the climate proving detrimental to his
health.
During DR. RAYMOND’S practical experience of nine
years in Australia he has built up a reputation un-
approached by any other physician in chronic diseases in
the colonies. Dr. Raymond has also relieved and cured
patients who had tried to no avail the so-called leading
Inedical talent in the world. Proof of this will be seen in
his valuable and scientific publications; and Dr. Raymond
would call the attention of deaf people to his latest scien-
tific paper on the “Meritsand Demerits of Artificial Ear-
Drums and Electro-Magnetic Treatment.”
DR. RAYMOND would also inform deaf persons that he
is the only AURIST in the British Empire that ever
exposed the fallacy of sticking ear-drums in the ear for
cure of deafness ; and, moreover, it is rank quackery for
any "Aurist”or “Oculist” to induce people to believe
that a mere external remedy will cure a disease, the root
of which lies in the general constitution.
DR. RAYMOND is a Thorough Physician, as well as a
Specialist ; hence his unrivalled success.
A series of Aural and Ophthalmic Papers, supplementary
to a volume published in 1887, will be sent on receipt of a
penny stamp. Address—

SYDNEY, N.S.W.

NOTE.—No mineral Poisons or the Knife used ncr I
agonising blisters. Veritas odmm peril!
Dr. Raymond intends shortly to Lecthre on the eminent
American Medical Philosopher - Dr. Samuel Thomson,
founder of the Botanic System of Practice, and the first
man to expose the Errors and Fallacies of the Faculty.
Dr. Raymond will, when he mounts the public platform]
lie the youngest medical lecturer and advocate in the
English-speaking world, he not having yet attained his
thirtieth year.

Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
™ TT r, 10th December, 1888.
To 11. F. Kugklmann, Esq.
Dear Sir —This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse everyday, masting away' until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last i began
to spit up blood, and what with the oolig’h and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of" bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became Very touch alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning* and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stritmv
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaming in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably,
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN
who suffer from the results of early follies, trans-
gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in
the water, accompanied by slight burning or
smarting sensation, Headaches, Drowsiness during
the day, circles round the eyes, Giddiness,
irregularity of the bowels, specks before the eyes,
bashfulness, discontentedness, weakness or pains
in the back. Liver or kidney complaints, dreams,
buzzing noises in the ears and head, pimples, a
fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in
st amps he will send secure from observation in a
plain wrapper, postage
FREE, A LARGE CLOTH-BOUND
BOOK.
Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you bo perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
opouion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves, i)r. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. AH

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1890.
The “Reconstruction of Society.”
Exception was taken by Sir Henry Parkes.
in the N.S. Wales Legislative Assembly’s
debate relative to the Strike, to a phrase
which had been printed in the first manifesto
of the Labour Defence Committee. The
phrase was the “ reconstruction of society.”
Trades Unionists were invoked thus ; “ Stand
shoulder to shoulder in this movement; it
will give us heroic results, for the next step
in the immediate future will be the recon-
struction of society.” Sir Henry Parkes
challenged Mr. O’Sullivan, who had pre-
ceded him in the debate, to explain the
meaning of this passage. Mr. O'Sullivan’s
reply was a repudiation of it as the utterance
of “ 3 fanatic and a fool. ’ The Premier of
New South Wales proceeded to give his
interpretation. It proclaimed, to his mind,
“a war against all society.” There is here
a conspicuous want of logic on the part of
Sir Henr\ Parkes. Had the invocation
asked all Unionists to prepare for the des-
truction of society, that would certainly have
been equivalent to a declaration of war
against all society. But, being, as it is, an
invitation to reconstruct society, it is just
the contrary. If a person declared his inten-
tion to reconstruct his house, that could
assuredly not be charged against him as an
intimation that ho designed to destroy all
houses. It might signify either one of" two
intentions : namely, to repair an inconvenient
and dilapidated building, or to substitute by
a process of rebuilding a substantial structure
for one which had proved unserviceable or
was already a mere heap of ruins.
# * *
, There is, in fact, nothing in the expres-
sion that attracted the notice of the New
South W ales Premier, which is either novel
or startling. It is an old and familiar friend
a venerable acquaintance of now unchal-
lenged respectability—under a new name.
To “re-construct ” is simply to “re-form.”
All, therefore, that this paragraph of the
Labour Manifesto proclaimed was an invita-
tion to the people to continue a work, uni-
versally admitted to be good and advantageous
so far as it has been carried out—the work
of REFORM. There is this difference, in-
deed ; that whereas the initial efforts were
directed merely to remodel the Parliament
of Great Britain, the modern exertion is to
reconstruct society. Our forefathers, as it
were, concentrated their attention upon the
porter s lodge ; our own generation has
turned its attention to the main building.
The present revival of the Reform movement’
while presenting points of variation, is never-
theless characterised by identity in most
aspects. Of the earlier period of activity,
Harriet Martineau thus discourses
Up to the close of ISK3, the spirit of parliamentary
reform was seldom evoked in the British Parliament.
W hen the spirit was occasionally raised upon the presenta-
tion of some stray petition, it had no alarms for the most
timid, and very few consolations for the most ardent. It
was a good, quiet spirit in the cellarage—an “ old mole,”
that called out, in antiquated phrase, about the Magna
Charta and the Bill of Eights; and the House of
Commons listened as to some gabble which concerned it
not, and went on with its proper work of Whig and Tory
fence, conducted upon the most approved principles of
the first masters of the science. But the “ worthy
pioneer ” got above ground in 1816, and, when he was
fairly loosened to the open sky, he was not quite so tame,
and innocent, and stupid a spirit as his ordinary sup-
porters and his systematic revilers had been in the habit
of believing him to be.
* * %
In what manner this spirit of reform was
dealt with ; how it was lirst denounced as
factitious and the result of imposture ; and
how later it was exorcised—not exactly by
“bell, book and candle’’—but by bill, are
matters of history. The British people, like
Hamlet, permitting their purpose to be
diverted by mere temporary expedients, then
conceived that the spirit was laid. Their
agitation was intense, but transitory. To-day
the apparition re-appears. “Do notfoi’get,”
says the spirit of Reform, “this visitation is
but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.”
Che British people—the Hamlet of this
drama of the nineteenth century—resume
the interrupted thread of their determina-
tion. -Sow, at last, they will obey the in-
junction and prompting of the spirit, and
cany out their intention to its full accom-
plishment, rejecting with scorn the sugges-
tion of interested and compromised parties
that the whole thing is a delusion. The
guilty Queen, it will be remembered, insists
that
This is the very coinage of your brain ;
This bodiless creation ecstasy is very cunning in.
In like manner, the Classes and their organs
would fain persuade the reformers or re-
constructors of to-day, that their ideals are
mere figments of a diseased imagination,
that there are no wrongs to be righted, no
usurpations to be swept away. But the
British people rejoin :
It ia not madness
That I have uttered: bring me to the test,
And I the matter will reward, which madness
Would gambol from. . . .
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
That not your madness but my maclness speaks*
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
hile rank corruption, mining all within, infects unseen.
* * *
That is to say, the revived party of Reform
retort to those who allege that they are but
dreamers and visionaries, that they are
prepared to sustain their case with argu-
ments as rational, as logical, and as lucid, as
any that were ever advanced on behalf of
any cause however solidly established and
widely approved. They are enabled, in
fact, to point to a mass of literature of the
highest order, in which their views and their
philosophy are expounded and advocated.
Those claims which from the year 1816 for-
ward they urged, have, after undergoing the
ordeals of ridicule, of denunciation, and of
reluctant examination, at length gained
respectful, even though hostile, investiga-
tion, and finally secured adoption and the
stamp of orthodoxy. They now advance a
further instalment, and submit with cheer-
fulness to the same preliminary treatment,
confident that the result will be the same as
in their earlier attempt. There is nothing
to disconcert the reformers or reconstructors
of to-day in the circumstance that their con-
ceptions are derided, that their leaders
are assailed with detraction, or that some
of their adherents offend the delicate
susceptibilities of conservatism. They
remember that when the cause of Reform
was lirst mooted even so liberal a man
as Brougham, who later was one of the
most valiant of its champions, described it,
in the House of Commons, as “ opposed by
some, deserted by others, and espoused by
persons whose conduct excited no small
degree of disgust out of doors.”
* * *
It is strange, indeed, that any man pretend-
ing to statesmanlike breadth of thought
should have been staggered by evidence that
Trades-b nionism recognises its own ten-
dency and frankly proclaims that its mission
is to effect a reconstruction of Society. A
very slight study of the past effects of
Trades-Unionism, and a very superficial
examination of its influence should have
shown that its results have been confined to
that very reconstruction, although the
changes wrought have been, up to the pre-
sent stage, only partial. Since the year
1825, when the penal laws against trades-
combinations to raise wages were relaxed,
the effects of Trades-Unions have been,
beyond question, to bring about a partial
reconstruction of society. Large sections of
workers—chiefly in these departments of
industry which demand a degree of skill and
handicraft only to be achieved by long
practice—have been emancipated from a
condition of almost absolute serfdom and
have gained power to strike bargains for the
sale of their labour. Men, who were chattels,
have, by combination, been enabled to look
their former owners straight in the face, and
not merely to refuse to be starved, but to
stipulate for something (no matter how little)
more than a mere sufficiency to keep the
breath of life in them, and even—to the
horror and indignation of their masters—
to tell them on what conditions work shall
be oondueted if he desires their aid. This is
an attitude which still fills the emplover
class with wrathful astonishment. It is
monstrous, he declares, it is outrageous and
ridiculous that his servants should pretend
to dictate to him how he shall carry on and
conduct “ his own business.” It has not yet
dawned upon men of this class that what he
calls his business is also very particularly the
business of every man—the scores or
hundreds who work' at it. The profits
indeed are his, but the business is that of
each of his “ hands,” and it is ©r may be of
momentous importance to each and all of
them that it be conducted on certain broadly
defined lines, insofar as regards their in-
terests.
* # *
It must be admitted that there has been a
very material reconstruction of society by
the operation of Trades-Unions already.
And there are unmistakeable signs that the
manifesto which has so shocked the venerable
personage at the head of the New South
Wales Ministry, quite accurately defines the
course of events when it predicts an ex-
tension of that operation. The benefits of
Trades-Unionism are at length commencing
to be participated in by other classes of
workers besides the order of skilled
mechanics, miners, and factory-hands. The
mere labourer, who has nought to sell but
his physical strength, has discovered the
efficiency of combination, and on the
first effort that of the London dock-
labourers—has scored a sensational win.
This event has had vast influence.
Its results are, as yet, mainly in the
womb of the future, and can only be
appreciated by such persons as are skilled
in political and economic obstetrics. But
this much is plain to every sensible man’s
observation and consciousness, that the
victory won by the London dock-labourers
has aroused an emotion of hope and a desire
- probably also an intention of emulation,
in the minds of millions of mere labourers
all over the civilised world. Such an emotion,
so far-reaching, has never yet taken a hold
of the minds of so great a multitude without
producing effects of corresponding magni-
tude. The effects in this instance will,
beyond doubt, take the direction of a
further instalment of the 44 re-construction
society.”
* * *
Nevertheless, it is necessary to recognise
that there are distinct limits to the adequacy
of Irades-unionism as a mechanism for the
amelioration in the condition of the working
class. The direction in which its develop-
ments are now plainly tending is towards
the inclusion and organisation of all wage-
earning people into unions. And such
unions it is intended to federate in one
common interest. The first of these opera-
tions bears within it the seeds of destruction.
I nder existing conditions there is not con-
stant employment available at decent re-
muneration for all the labour which is in
the market. Even were unions to pursue
the traditional policy of the old-unionism and
restrict their membership, thus constituting
what has been aptly termed Labour-aristo-
cracy, the competition of excluded labourers
would break the back-bone of the unions,
by enabling employers to defy their claims
and to replace their members by the too
redundant crowd of outsiders. If, on the
contrary, the Unions held their barriers
open to every brother aspirant for work, the
excess of Unionists would necessarily have
the same effect, and wages would fall. The
upward move of wages consequent on the
power of Unions would assuredly not tend to
increase consumption of the commodities
produced for exchange outside the com-
munity in which they were produced. Em-
ployers cannot make profitable work without
limit. Even Co-operation—from which so
much is expected—would not by any means
realise what is claimed for it. If, for example,
the existing coastal maritime carrying trade
were shifted from the present competing
employer-companies into the hands of the
State, there would not be more hands needed
There would be fewer. Under present
arrangements, more steamers have been run
than there has been full employment for.
Of these, a proportion are run to waste, as
it were. And under a proper communal
system, all waste would be eschewed. There-
fore, the crews would be reduced in numbers.
• • *
There is no escaping the conclusion that
employers are exceedingly blind and foolish.
They are doomed to be crushed between the
upper mill-stone of rent and the lower mill-
stone of wages. All along the Australian
coast, for years past, steamship-owners have
been doing carrying business too cheaply.
Somebody has benefited thereby. Not the
seamen, and certainly not the officers. The
former of these classes has extorted some
approach to fair remuneration out of the
groaning employers by sheer force of com-
bination. The latter, uncombined, could
not get a concession. But who, then, has
leaped the advantage ? The land-owners.
Ihe cheaper the carriage to market, the
larger the nett-profits from cultivation. If
the cultivator were himself the owner of the
land, the larger the return into his own
pocket—not as cultivator, indeed, but as
landlord. If he were but a tenant, then the
landlord would, of course, in due time
raise his rent by just the amount saved him
by over-cheapness of carriage to market.
Ihus, it will be seen that Trades-Unionism
is but an expedient and without fundamental
security. _ The causes of human inequality
of conditions lie deeper and beyond the re«"h
of Unionism.
* * *
But although merely an instrument,
Irades-Umonism has its potencies. It can
exert a vast influence by giving sway to its
political side. At the present juncture the
duty of its leaders is so plain that no man can
mistake. It is to prepare to take possession
of the Legislature. It is gratifying to observe
from published statements that the Unionist
leaders have grasped the essentialness
of this action. There is still one
pitfall, however, in the path, which
it will require all their sagacity, all th '
vigilance, and no inconsiderable
self-denial and of their influence to eual l
them to escape. That is the natural disno •
tion to put forward actual members of th
own organisations as Labour candidate' 1 '
This process will be successfully resorted t
we doubt not, in course of time. But -° :
yet, nothing but failure and injury can h*
anticipated if it be resorted to. I n eve D ®
instance in which recourse has been had t?
it, the result has been calamitous. r pj
Labour candidates have not been
and the successful competitors have obtain ? j
their seats free from any pledges or oblhr!
tions to the labour voters. The real!
sagacious plan is that adopted by the teetotV
bodies. _ Everything is disregarded save th,!
one object. Candidates of all parties are
called upon to declare their sentiments and
shufflers are inexorably treated as rnorHl
foes. 1
* * *
This is precisely the expedient the Labour
party should adopt. They should turn a
deaf ear to every call to arms, save those
sounded by their own trumpets. Between
contending parties they should stand aloof
in imposing array, potent to give the victory
to this or to that combatant—providing
their own stipulations be conceded. PoJi"
ticians are a weak-backed and temporising
race. There are at least 100,000 men synn
pathetic with Unionism and entitled to a
vote, in New South Wales alone. Such a
body, properly organised and handled
should be able to turn, to their own advan-
tage, every election in the coming series
which may be contested between Protec-
tionist and Freetrader, or any other rival
cult. To the true adherent of the enfran-
chisement of Labour, Protection and Free-
trade, the Orange and the Green, the Pub-
lican and the Water-jugger, should be
equally indifferent. The vote of Labour
should be given to the candidate who,
being worthy of trust at all, declares him-
self most definitely in favour of the principles
of the Labour propaganda. And that
should be short, clear, and decisive. Every
elected member should be carefully watched
as to his votes and expressions in Parlia-
ment. Humbugs and traitors should meet
with unflinching vengeance the next time
they have to face their constituents. By
those means, and those only, will the wage-
earners—the masses—of Australia be enabfed
to secure their real proportion of influence
on its public affairs, and thus only will it
ever be possible here to effect that recon-
struction of Society which must be accom-
plished before the producer of wealth can
hope to share in its enjoyments.
£12 4s, 9d.
Mu. Jacob Goldstein, of the Melbourne
Charity Organisation Society, was invited the
other day to give evidence before the Charities
Commission of Victoria, and in the course of
his testimony lie cast a lurid light on the ways
of modern benevolence. During a period of 12
months the organised benefactors who hire Mr.
Goldstein have expended about £460 in the
prosecution of their noble purpose, and of this
sum—all of which was raised by public subscrip-
tion—£l2 4s. 9d. went to assist the poor and
the suffering, and to alleviate in some measure
the aggregate of human misery; and the
balance was used for salaries, expenses, and
sundries. A good deal of the money extracted
from a sympathetic nation appears to have
gone to pay the energetic “ enquiry-officer ”
a species of bowelless committee of one, whose
business it is to root out the morals, religious
convictions, genealogy, height, length, breadth
and thickness of every applicant for assistance,
so that no one save an apostle may get a cent,
out of the funds ; and the ghastly vigour with
which this gentleman shunted the poor who
weren’t orthodox, and the hungry whose heads
were not surmounted by a halo, stands out
conspicuously in every separate copper of that
£l2 4s. 9d. The amount which this capable
official must have saved by his investigations is
evidently tremendous, and but for his un-
exampled vigour it would have been difficult to
reserve enough to pay expenses. Still it is
painful to reflect that with a little more super-
human energy the outlay of that £l2 4s. 9d.
might have been avoided, and when once this
unjustifiable leakage was stopped the Charity
Organisation Society would be able to devote
itself exclusively to the lofty mission of paying
salaries, rent, gas, and other charges, and
meanwhile letting the poor go to the tomb.
If an enquiry - officer only enquires hard
enough he can find good and sufficient
proof that nobody on earth is moral enough
to deserve the gift of a loaf or a bed;
his mission is to squash the applicant for relief,
and throw him out into the street, and if a £250
officer is not vigorous enough to overpower and
eject £l2 4s. 9d. worth of tattered mendicant it
is time that a stronger man took his place. The
purpose of the organised benefactor is not to
relieve the famished outcast—that is an ex-
ploded superstition based on the injudicious
lavishness of an unorganised Redeemer, who
went about recklessly feeding the poor in
Palestine, and died at last without ever pub-
lishing a balance-sheet, or even hiring a secre-
tary ; his business is first of all to ask the out-
cast what possible right he has to be famished,
and having done this he tells the applicant to
call round the week after next. And in the
interval thus afforded he spends £5 in inquiries
and travelling expenses, and having duly in-
vestigated the case he is generally in a position
to tell the hungry wreck to depart into outer
darkness, because he was drunk in the year
1853, or was arrested for assault and battery a
generation ago. The only possible improve-
ment on this system would be to fire the pauper
over the staircase on his first appearance, and
devote the time which is now wasted in listen-
ing to his tale of woe to the collection of more
subscriptions ; and then the travelling expenses


eouKl be saved, and the amount of this economy
demoted to raising the salary of the toilworn
secretary, and the inquiry officer could have the
sum which is now wasted in riotous postage-
stamps, and the rent could bo divided among
the Board, and the gas-money and sundries
might be scrambled for by anybody who wanted
fche ° m - *
'Phe charity organisation system, however, is
eß ly in its infancy, and the injudicious scat-
toration of £l2 4s. 9d. arose most probably from
causes which are not likely to recur. The great
movement is hampered a good deal by the action
of various ill-judged philanthropists who relieve
the homeless wanderer instead of throwing him
out, and who have not yet realised the lofty
fcruth that benevolence consists in collecting
subscriptions, and bidding the sufferer come
and be relieved, and then, when he does come,
chasing him into the hills with a club. Also
there is a lack of system about many of these
individuals, and they even feed a starving
wretch right off, instead of spending two or
three weeks in making inquiries, while he dies
at night in a damp spot behind a fence. Mr.
Goldstein therefore urges that something should
be done to awaken the hardened and irregular
benefactor, and show him the evil of a system
which has no “ inquiry officer” or travelling
expenses in it, and which is loose on the subject
of gas and balance-sheets. He appeals to the
Commission to lend a hand in bouncing out the
irregular Samaritan, and in suppressing the
good shepherd whose money goes to the hungry
instead of to the secretary, and he has various
other complaints as well.
Unfortunately, charitable societies overlapped each
Other in some places. This was the case at Brunswick,
where there were two ladies’ benevolent societies, who
were working in opposition to one another. The same
fact was noticeable in Collingwood. He also objected to
the admission of the purely casually destitute into some
of the Melbourne charitable institutions. They had much
better he taken care of in the gaols. The institutions to
which he referred were the casual wards of the Immi-
grants’ Home, the shelter in Dr. Sinoleton’s Home, and
the casual ward in the St. Vincent de Paul Home. The
great defect of these institutions was that no records
were kept, and that relief was granted on application.
The voice of the £l2 4s. 9d. cries aloud in this
utterance. For if the “ casually-destitute ” are
shoved into gaol as the due reward of their
offence, then the only thing that can meet the
ease of the permanently destitute is to hang
them or throw them over a precipice, and when
the people who are in need of charity are thus
disposed of the Charity Organisation Society
can collect the money of the public with a glad
heart and organise itself all day long and pay
salaries the rest of the time. And yet there is
base ingratitude in the secretary’s suggestion,
for it is the existence of the unfed, unemployed
citizen, who is awarded the humble sum with
the odd coppers at the end of it, that insures
him his copious income and keeps the whole
show going. A society which collects money
for the aged pauper and spends over nine-
tenths of the takings upon itself, and then
blasts the starving outcast who forms its own
stock-in-trade, and wants him put in gaol on
top of his other miseries, is a thing without
bowels or compassion, or even ordinary horse-
sense of the plainest kind.
* * *
Still there is one redeeming feature in this
picture of latter-day philanthropy. The Society
actually did bestow upon the poor the aforesaid
sum of £l2 4s. 9d. Also, there is no reason to
believe that it plundered any applicant of his
clothes, and sold them to help to pay the salary
of the inquiry officer, or to defray the gas-bill.
If it successfully absorbed in “ expenses ” over-
-90 per cent, of the money subscribed for
the tattered mendicant, and cursed other phil-
anthropists for doing the same, it refrained at
least from capturing the mendicant, and boiling
him down, and trading off the products. The
Christian who giveth to the poor through the
medium of the Charity Organisation Society
sifts his money through a ladder, but it is cheer-
ing to reflect that the amount that adheres to
the steps ultimately reaches its destination—
the sum which falls through being duly collared
to pay the secretary. Evidently the steps are
greased, and the ladder planted at an acute
slope, as a guarantee against too much adhe-
sion, but that is a mere detail. And if, as
seems more than probable, the joint-stock bene-
factors may be inspired at an early date to erect
the three-ball sign above their door, and put the
secretary’s honoured name upon the tickets,
then the industry will stand on a sound basis,
and assume its proper attitude before the world.
And, meanwhile, the benevolent citizen who
has compassion on the widow and the fatherless
is earnestly requested to send round his cheque,
and the secretary will go out on his behalf and
call on the widow and the fatherless in a cab,
which will be charged to the cash account, and
will point out that they ought to he in gaol,
and will tell them of the sinfulness of granting
relief either “ on application ’ or any other way,
and will depart again with the joyous reflection
that his salary is going on all the time.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Divorce by Consent.
Judge Hood, of Victoria, is again tangled up
in the Divorce Act. The other day he refused
an application by a woman whose husband
abandoned her twelve years ago, on the ground
that she had not exerted herself to recover his
affections and win him back ; and unless there
was proof that she had done so, it was feared
that a pernicious system of divorce by collusion
or mutual consent might be inaugurated. It
would be interesting to know why divorces
should not be granted by mutual consent. As
a rule, when two people have contracted a re-
liable hatred for each other, they are bound to
separate, and a law which requires that a woman
should be severely kicked, or starved and neg-
lected for three years, before she can obtain the
release which she desires, and which her husband
is perfectly willing to grant, is idiotic beyond
expression. If husband and wife are both quite
tired of being together, that is as good a reason
as could be imagined why they should be parted,
and when the meddlesome State forcibly keeps
them together nobody is any the better for its
interference, and its grandmotherly care pays
no dividends. Its nominal object is to secure
the happiness of all parties concerned ; but as
the State cares not one solitary rap for any-
body’s happiness, this explanation is absurdly
thin. Divorce by mutual consent is declared to
have proved itself an unmixed evil wherever it
has been tried ; but then it never has been tried
in any civilised country. Divorce by mutual
agreement, suppplemented by hard public
lying, is no doubt sufficiently common ; but
then lying, whether public or private, is
a failure under all circumstances, and yet, even
in the most advanced communities, it is an
absolutely essential element when two people
are weary of each other’s society, and wish to
separate before a worse thing befalls them. The
sanctity of unhappy marriages is merely the
tail-end of an old, exploded superstition, and
the law has no more right to decree that any
human being shall be miserable, than it has to
declare that lie shall be damp and afflicted with
corns. The parsonical objection, “Whom (Tod
hath joined let no man put asunder,” is effete
and out of date, for God is neither the solemn
sin-shifter who gabbles over the marriage-
service in an empty, hollow-sounding church,
nor the dreary registrar who shuffles through
the civil formula in a dusty office, and where
man takes the fees he must also assume the
responsibility. And if divorce by mutual con-
sent is a thing of ghastly iniquity, too awful to
lie seriously considered in an alleged Christian
land, we would be glad if .fudge Hood, or any
other Judge, would suggest a logical substitute.
The natural antithesis of this sinful device
would be divorce without the consent of either
party, and Mr. Hood’s opinions upon that ought

The Coming Man.
Governor Jersey is still some distance off, but
already between 1900 and 2000 paragraphs have
been published in different parts of Australia
setting forth the blessings and advantages of
the new Deputy-Gracious. Asa consequence,
Jersey is getting dreadfully monotonous before
ho has even started. Moreover, all the descrip-
tions of him are as commonplace as a heap of
mud, and the enthusiasm is dreadfully heavy
and tough in consequence. The new Governor
is as hopelessly devoid of thrill as a bun in a
shop-window, and even his most devoted wor-
shippers can find nothing to say about him that
is more novel or suprising than a pump would
be. The sample paragraph generally goes like
this
Lord Jersey is a pleasant and fluent speaker, a man of
wealth and liberality, and well versed in affairs. In
Oxfordshire, of which county he is Lord-Lieutenant, he
enjoys great popularity, and has always taken the lead in
every useful and philanthropic movement. It is a great
thing to find that noblemen of wealth and ability, with a
political career before them at home, are still willing to
accept responsible and arduous posts in the colonies.
All this simply means that Governor Jersey is
an inexpensive individual of the ordinary size
who looks very much as usual. He showed no
particular signs of genius when he was young,
and has shown none since. He was born in the
same way as anybody else, and he grew up on
his own responsibility. Also he never did any-
thing worth printing, and he has a look in his
eye which might signify latent genius, or might
merely mean that he was wondering where his
dog had got to, and he has two legs and never
did any serious harm. All the eloquence of
several hundred papers amounts to that and
nothing more. And consequently The Bulletin
would be glad to know what all the row is
about.
The “Free Labourer.”
The “free labourer so called because he is
liable to be bossed within an inch of his life by
his master without any prospect or possibility
of redress—promises to become a A r ery serious
element in Australian society. He is a non-
descript hanger-on of the great army of industry
—an individual who (like the Institute of
Marine Engineers) reaps where he has not sown
and curses the individual who sowed for him—
and his own future depends entirely in the suc-
cess of the Trades-Unionism which he denounces
with so much unnecessary vehemence. Conse-
quently his position is an anomalous one, for if
Unionism survives he will lose his temporary
importance, and if Unionism dies he will lose
his importance just the same, and along with it
he will lose everything else that makes life
worth having. Whatever Labour has gained
within the last century it has gained by com-
bination. The workman of years ago was a
serf of the meanest order. He toiled from 12
to 18 hours daily in a noisome factory, and
along with him his wife and his children
laboured in the same stifling atmosphere of dust
and fluff and disease, for no single worker, how-
ever industrious, could earn more than enough
for his own subsistence. The unceasing round
of grinding Labour began in infancy, and from
the age of five years the children of the people
dragged in their weary, stunted existence and
spent their joyless lives pent up between the
high brick walls of huge workshops, where, in
many cases they died as well as lived, worn out
by the premature old age which came upon them
when their childhood was only dawning. But
gradually, even amid this hideous slavery,
the workman learned the advantages to be
gained by combination, and after long years
of agitation and strife he achieved the
right to be a little more of a human
being and a little less of a mere animal than
heretofore. Philanthropy and Christianity did
nothing for him ; what liberty he acquired was
gained by the brute force of numbers and
material pressure, and it has since been retained
by the same influences. It was Unionism in the
past which earned those privileges which make
it worth the “ free labourer’s ” while to be alive
and without which he would be to-day what his
great-grandfather was—something a shade lower
than a dog and of less account than a horse ;
and it is the Unionism of the present which
alone saves him from reverting to the hopeless
slavery and degradation of his ancestors. The
Unionist fights single-handed the endless battle
by which alone Labour preserves its liberty,
and in sacrificing himself to raise the status of
Labour he necessarily assists his enemy, the
blackleg, as well as himself; and the latter
reviles Tiim for doing it, and grabs the plunder.
And yet, if he succeeds in his effort to destroy
Unionism he only insures his own destruction
Monopoly is no less grasping and unscrupulous
to-day than it was years ago when that eminent
philanthropist and public benefactor, Mr.
Bright, declared himself ready to die in the
last ditch to maintain the old system under
which women and children died of exhaust ion
and hunger and ill-usage in the factories where
he himself made his sanctified pile : and Chris-
tianity is no more Christian than it was then.
The employer in England or Australia is moder-
ately humane—by Act of Parliament; but the
employer of the same race in Bombay, where that
Act of Parliament is inoperative, lias revived
all the old horrors of slavery in its worst form.
The monopolist of Australia is of the same
brotherhood as the monopolist of London, who
has his cash invested in the Zanzibar slave-
trade, and who farms the convict-worked mines
of Siberia. The love of money is incurable,
ineradicable, and unchangeable, and almost the
only honest name to be found in history is that
of Judas, who handed back the thirty pieces of
silver and then hanged himself. Trades-
Unionism is as essential for the defence of
Labour now as it was in the reign of George
the Imbecile and his worst predecessors, and
the so-called “ free-labourer,” who seeks to
undermine it for his own passing advantage, is
in the position of a rescued man who endeavours
to throw his rescuer overboard on the ground
that the boat which has saved him Cannot afford
room for two. And if he succeeds in his effort
his reward is already awaiting both him and his
descendants to the tenth generation, and his
memory w ill be cursed by posterity along with
those of Gehazi and Benedict Arnold and
many another gentleman of the same order.
The G-rovel of the Drapery Trade.
Dear Bulletin, —WheneverCapitaland Labour
are at war, and commotion is in the air, and the
parochial sycophant is in motion to uphold the
cause of “ law and order,” the Australian draper
comes to the front. Why grovel and drapery
should invariably go together is a problem
which can only be solved by deep scientific
research, but experience has proved them to be
inseparable elements. The lady-like he-female
with the yardstick represents the one branch of
industry that never was known to strike a blow r
in its own defence. It is underpaid and over-
worked and trodden upon, and it serves as a
humble target for bad language of- all sorts and
descriptions, and yet it is the only worm on
record which never turns. It turns fiat, and
that is all. When employers and employed are
at variance, and a great effort is being made to
elevate the status of Labour, the gilded duke
who flies round in the ribbon department always
casts in the weight of his little soul with the
cause of property. He has no property himself
and no prospect of any, but the very name of
Labour suggests perspiration and dust and
brawny vulgarity, and all these influences are
antagonistic to the correct hang of his pants and
the accurate adjustment of his coat-tail, and
the attitude of his collar. Therefore the draper
fills the ranks of the special constables, and
humps bales and boxes and unclean bags on the
wharf at a crisis, and breaks his back gene-
rally to prop up the cause of monopoly.
He does these things partly because it
is respectable to manifest his antagonism to
that low and offensive thing, the ordinary
every-day toiler, and partly because he would
be sacked if he refused to do them. He
exhibits no resentment at this state of things
for he is a being apart; he belongs to Labour,
but he refuses to recognise the fact lest he
should burst his tie in doing it, and he affects to
be an essential part of Capital and is kicked in
consequence. He is neither man nor woman
nor any other recognised institution—only a
draper. He is the backbone of Australian
“ loyalty,” the prop and stay of the Imperial
Federation movement, and the principal sup-
port of the Primrose organisation and the Social
Purity Society ; also, he hollers loud and long
whenever the name of his beloved Queen comes
to the front. He is a social mystery, for
nobody knows what becomes of him when he
gets old, and nobody—so far as we can learn —
ever saw a dead draper or attended the funeral
of one. Probably he is sacked when he ceases
to be young and beautiful, and then he either
bursts or evaporates and fades away. No
historian has recorded that a draper ever rose
to eminence or did anything for the good of his
country. One of the great names on the scroll
of Fame is that of the negro flunkey who
asserted the independence of San Domingo, but
the weary little dude in the glove and sock
department never did anything but oil his hair
and look elegant. And yet the poor, servile,
stunted he-milliner is a serious obstruction to
human progress. His grovel is so far-reaching
and complete, and his subserviency so
illimitable, that he is a public evil as well as a
nuisance. He is incapable of elevating himself
on account of his collar, and he is filled with an
arrogant longing to suppress everybody else
whose collar isn’t up to the mark. He shudders
when he hears that an individual in a woollen
shirt and large boots has ventured to assert
himself, and his soul revolts—at 30s. a week—
when he conies in contact with a low, coarse
person who drives a cart and hasn’t any eye-
glass. And, worst of all, he is utterly devoid
of sympathy with any democratic sentiment or
any progressive idea, because, unhappily, he
knows no better, being only a draper.— Titus

Tlxe Deification of Dow.
Dear Bulletin, —As an admirer of unblushing
cheek, I would like to put John Lamont Dow,
the Victorian Minister of Lands, upon a
pedestal. A few years back, Dow invested £2
in the Premier Permanent Building Society,
now (probably permanently) defunct. Somehow
or other he got jammed in among other notable
persons and was elected a Director. He sat as
a Director, drew Directors’ fees, signed cheques
for many thousands of pounds of other people’s
money—all the time not having the necessary
legal qualification of a Director, and not being
interested in the Society for more than £2 at any
time. It is even a matter of conflicting
evidence whether he did not actually get that
back. Well, Dow was hauled up, with others,
and paraded before a police-court, birst, his
colleagues—Ministers of the Crown, who hold
Police Magistrates in the palms of their hands,
so to speak—gave him a prior testimonial of
innocence, without knowing anything of the
evidence, they gave him their conviction of his
acquittal, if I may be allowed to pun. 1 hat was
bad enough, but the world let it pass without
much murmur. Next, the Court itself (held in
the hollows of the hands aforesaid) acquitted
Dow “without a stain,”&c. He had undoubtedly
assisted by his default to wreck the small
thrift-made fortunes of thousands of poor,
honest nobodies, but that was a small matter.
The world let the Court acquittal also pass
without much murmur. Next, the Gillies
menagerie received their whilom enmeshed
comrade back again witli open arms. This
time, there was a squeak or two from part ql
the press, but nothing to rend the welkin. It
was only feebly urged that a man who signed
away private fools’ savings without much
enquiry and as a matter of form, and when
every single cheque he signed was illegal, wesn t
exactly the man who should be placed over a
department where signing away tracts of the
people’s property as matters of mere form
might come within the routine of his daily
temptations. Well, let that pass, too. But,
now 1 Let the Melbourne Age give us the neat
vault of impudence :
Mv. Charles Sergeant, M.L.0., has consented to act as
treasurer to the testimonial fund that has been voluntarily
inaugurated in various parts of the colony as an expres-
sion of sympathy towards Mr. J. L. Dow, M.L.A., in the
circumstances that led to his temporary retirement from
the position of Minister of Lands. Subscriptions for-
warded to Mr. Sergeant, at Parliament House, will be
handed over to the Central Committee appointed to
supervise the testimonial.
Brass and platinum ! The front of it! Here,
they are going to testimonialise a man for —to
put it in the mildest possible form —stupidly
and carelessly and good-naturedly helping to
ruin 10,000 men better than and as honest as
himself ! Were lin Mr. Dow’s place, my heart
would be riven at the knowledge of the ruin at
which I had so thoughtlessly and unwittingly
assisted, and I should nip this collection busi-
ness in the bud, by imploring Sergeant and
Cos. thus —“For God’s sake, gentlemen, for my
sake, leave that terrible mistake of mine alone.
Let it die. It rankles in my bosom and envenoms
my memory, but let it be limited, please, to
self-torture. Remind others not of that which is
ever present in my remorseful heart. Let my
life atone for this grievous past blindness/’
You have let down Dow very gently, dear
Bulletin, but will you pass over this move
in silence ?If not, I want to know when
Mr. Sergeant is going to start a collec-
tion for the families ruined by the Premier
Permanent follies in which Dow partici-
pated ? I want to know if Dow is manly
enough to forbid such an insult to humanity as
this flaunting testimony—this death-dance over
the grar 7 es of thousands of people’s social hap-
piness? I know that Mr. Dow belongs to a
class of people who hold themselves as being on
a higher plane than ordinary erring mortals —a
class to which also belong Deakin, and Nimmo,
and Mirams, and Mtjnko, and—well, and others
among the sponges who suck nutriment out of
the sentiments and weaknesses of honest man-
hood—the class of water-drinkers and water-
boasters (a water-drinker may be a good man,
but a water-boaster, never !), and every time
this class turns out a specimen of its perfected
type of brazen cheek, I feel humbly thankful
that I am only an honest— Dipsomaniac. —Mel-
bourne, 25th Sept., 1890.
“ The Voice of the Wharf.”
It is a tolerably bad sign of a labour-leader
when the newspapers of the capitalistic classes
are continually loading him with praise. Just
such a species of torture is being meted out
every day in Melbourne to Mr. Hancock, Secre-
tary of the Typographical Association, and
Chairman of the Finance and Control Committee
of the Trades Hall, Melbourne. The Argus
and Daily Telegraph and their satellite
fawners find themselves almost daily impelled
to hold up Mr. Hancock to admiration as a
paragon of broad-mindedness and a level-headed,
calm, shrewd, and honest labour-leader. From
our observation of the gentleman in question,
we don’t think this fulsome praise is nauseous
to him. We have evidence that he is impulsive.
When the Employers in Melbourne held their
first big meeting, Mr. Hancock was present by
invitation. So powerful was his first resultant
impulse that he rushed the newspaper offices
that night with a sample letter to each, in which
he expressed mingled wonder at, and admiration
of the moderate language and demands of the
employers, and made a bold bid for unearned
popularity by suggesting concession. At his
next semi-public utterance —interview with a
Press fiend, if we remember aright— Hancock
was himself again. He had evidently, since his
press-writing frenzy of the night before, fore-
gathered with his unionist mates, and had
received newer and fresher impulses, and so he
scathingly analysed ami criticised the domineer-
ing and dictating speeches of the employers—
the same speeches that he had before found so
full of sweet reasonableness. Mr. Hancock
obtruded anew personality altogether upon the
Victorian Parliament, through the medium of
Mr. Beazley, a member who opposes the open-
ing of libraries and museums on the Sawbath.
Mr. Beazley read to the House a letter from
Hancock, in order to show that Hancock
differed strongly on this Sunday question
from his labour colleague, Trenwith, who is
moving in the direction of getting the people’s
institutions opened to them on the Sabbath. In
this letter, the versatile Hancock pictures him-
self as “ a working-man pleading for this day
of rest ” —an attitude in which he might well
be depicted by some cunning and skilful artist
who wants to make a rapid fortune. Speaking
of Trenwith, Hancock says—
It must not be supposed that the working-men oJ
Victoria are in accord with his religious views. It is
the voice of the wharf and the Hall of Science that you
are invited to listen to.
The mighty Hancock denouncing “ the voice of
the wharf ” hero shows himself as the Victorian
prototype of that fine old New South Wales
Conservative, Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P.,
who virtuously denies that the New South
Wales workman is a “socialist, a communist,

or a lovelier,” and denounces as “faddists and
fanatics ” the men who say that their object
is to “ re-constitute society.” Yet Hancock
is very glad to get the backing-up of “the
voice of the wharf ” when he organises and
carries on a strike. It is by means of “the
voice of the wharf ” that he hopes to compel
shipowners to do tardy justice to their officers
and seamen ; and squatters to make acceptable
terms with the union shearers. It is this
ignoring of the lower strata of labour, this
creation of exclusive, five-guinea entrance, one-
in-ten-black-ball-pills, trades-union castes, that
constitutes the great weakness of the unions in
time of strike. It is this contempt of the
fundamental principle of a labour-union that
cx’eates a majority of non-unionist labourers,
whom the unions have to fight in addition to
the employers. If his letter is not another
merely tangential impulse, if it expresses his
own contemptuous opinion about “ the voice of
the wharf,” then, we say, that Hancock richly
deserves all the odium which the praise of a
capitalistic press should bring on a masquerading
labour-leader. The voice of the wharf to-day
is the voice of the nation ten years hence.
“ Fire Low!”
The sinful folly of calling amateur swash-
bucklers from the country to mount guard over
a labour crisis in town has been unwittingly
exposed—not that any further exposure was
needed—by a gory-minded individual named
Gordon, who combines the business of news-
paper-proprietor with the pleasure of a lieuten-
ancy in the Mounted Rifles. At the frenzied
call of “duty” Gordon gathered together the
fire-worshippers of Alexandra (Vic.), which is
the mountain home of his weekly organ, and
galloped them away to Melbourne, from whence
he forwarded his editor a yarn that brought the
Yea and Alexandra Standard one transient
gleam of notoriety to brighten the monotony of
its miserable existence. In truth, the tale un-
folded by this newspaper proprietor under arms
will not soon be forgotten. W ith a ludicrous,
though lamentable, 'belief that he was publish-
ing glad tidings, the lieutenant told how
Colonel Price, previous to marching them into
Divine Service, exhorted the Mounted Rifles to
silence any “disturbers of law and order”
(meaning Unionists) by firing low and laying
them out. Colonel Price, when confronted with
this report of his alleged patriotic eloquence,
denied saying “lay them out,” but admitted
that he ordered his braves to fire low and
effectively, because the more effectively they
fired the sooner it would be over. Perhaps,
then, the Yea and Alexandra Standard man
laid them out in his heated imagination—not
that a subtle distinction between words uttered
and meaning conveyed can be of much conse-
quence. W hat we have chiefly to consider is
the spirit that animated the Mounted Rifles in
general, as it was revealed in the lieutenant’s
letter to his own particular rag. On the Sab-
bath morning sacred to the Colonel's harangue
there were 1000 troops in readiness, and “the
knowledge of this state of preparedness for the
maintenance of order had a most salutary effect
on the scourings of humanity ,” chirped the
grim visaged war person who supplies public
opinion to Yea astd Alexandra. Nobody,
as it happened, evinced the least desire
to be fired at low and laid out upon the damp
award of Flinders’ Park, therefore the gallant
boys in barracks had to sit and nurse “ their
one regret ” that they couldn’t have “ a good go-
in. ” The piping times of peace are right enough
for the Mounted Rifle on his native heath, but
when hastily summoned to Melbourne, in the
Queen’s name, he comes with the breezy notion
of having a good go at the scourings of humanity.
In that charitable term any thinking man can
detect at least one mischievous result of the
“ firm policy ’’ adopted by the Governments of
N.S.W. and Victoria. A certain antipathy to
townsmen ever lurks in the dark corners of the
bucolic mind, and needs but little encourage-
ment, unfortunately, to come forth and manifest
itself. If allowed to lie dormant this stupid
antipathy is soon moth-eaten away. The
authorities have just given the accursed thing
an airing, and have sprinkled more pepper of
prejudice over it. It will return to the country
in a comparatively fresh, vigorous condition,
and the idea that a Melbourne labour-crowd
comprises the scourings of humanity will cir-
culate through the interior with the velocity of
a bad shilling.
Special Constables.
Dear Bulletin, —Premier Parkes was right
in a constitutional sense when he rejected the
offer of unionist specials made by unionist
leaders. The quarrel was one between two
sections of the people, neither of which had
rebelled against the State, and the duty of the
Government was, in the first instance, to rely
on its own ordinary resources, and, if these
resources became exhausted, then to appeal to
the general community for auxiliary service for
the preservation of the public peace. But while
Sir Henry was right in conception, he was
lamentably wrong in method. There is no
doubt that had the employers offered a contin-
gent, or the blacklegs offered a contingent, he
would have rejected the offer as he did that of
the unionists ; for the principle was a clear one,
and could not have been violated without in-
curring national reproach. But, in effect, Sir
Henry s action stultifies the principle. In the
first place, he did not sufficiently rely on the
ordinary resources of the Government. Although
in his official capacity currents of information
reach him which do not come to the average
citizen, it is still safe to hold that he ordered
the enrolment of special constables before the
ordinary resources were exhausted. Every
citizen car. rorm an idea upon that, and,
merely remarking that special means of
obtaining news are often special means
of exciting panic in the receiver, I let this
{toint drop. On the second point 1 impeach
>ir Henry with being guilty of that form of
political blunder which is always a crime. The
method adopted by him to obtain special con-
stables put the special constabulary into the
employers’ hand. The employers or their
devoted myrmidons donned the badge and
gripped the baton of authority, ostensibly to
r *strain excesses, but in reality to show unionists
that the employers had the Government at their
back. This was a political, a social crime. It
might have led to flaming houses and gutters of
blood. In a free country and when Labour is
stronger such a blind act on the part of an
administrator will, beyond a doubt, turn a feud
between two sections of the public into a war to
the knife between one of the sections and
the State. Sir Henry throws the blame, in
so far as he is willing to admit blame, for
the fact that the unionists are not as
well represented among the specials as are the
employers, on Mr. Eosbery. As Colonial
Secretary he considers that he did his duty
when he laid down a principle, and if the work-
ing out of the principle gave the employers a
special constabulary, he alleges that to be a
matter of detail with which he should not be
expected to be acquainted. But in a case like
the present the detail is the heart of the prin-
ciple, and when in the enrolment any one
section showed an intention to preponderate, it
was the bounden duty of Government to frus-
trate that intention. Dereliction of duty on this
point is a crime—and in certain circumstances
one which the criminals do not get a second
opportunity to perpetrate. It is to be hoped
that when the trouble subsides, a return show-
ing the occupations of the present batch of
special constables will be laid on the table of
the Legislative Assembly.—Yours, Onlooker.
“I Want to go Home.’'
The exodus of vice-regal ladies from this un-
happy country is, in the language of journalism,
assuming the preportions of an epidemic. The
Countess of Hopetoun, an apparently healthy
enchantress, who came up smiling at Randwick
races only the other day, “ has been causing
her Earl much uneasiness” {runs the official
narrative) for some time past, and is sailing for
England on October 11th in order to get the
‘ ‘ best London advice ” re her physical condition,
and the latest fashions. Hopetoun himself we
had regarded as a noble object of uneasiness
since he swooned over his first leim, but our
fears were evidently misplaced, inasmuch as his
fascinating consort was the really delicate
member of the firm. Doubtless he fainted at
the thought of losing her, and it is to
avoid such a catastrophe that the lady’s
pilgrimage to dear old Hingland was ordered
by the faculty. Anyhow, the Victorian Governor-
ess intends to go where Lady Norman has
gone, and where Lady Kintore is expected to
be found shortly. We have a hazy notion
(unfortunately our recollections of these great
social events are considerably mixed) that Lady
Onslow has also sailed, or wants to sail, for the
land of her birth, and we are prepared to take
oath that Lady Robinson got there a good deal
during her husband’s reign in South Australia.
Here, then, we have enough solid fact and hazy
supposition to justify an anxious enquiry as to
whether this hemisphere can be expected to
hold together much longer? We find it stated
in all directions that the nominal Governor of
any Australasian colony is merely intended to
form a respectable background for his exalted
missus, and that the actual representative of
Victoria Regina is a sweet vision in petticoats
upon whose successful mashing of the populace
the strengthening of “ those silken bonds ”
depends. Lord Knutseord has said as much
the press on both sides of the world commended
the Colonial Secretary’s candour. An ex-Gover-
nor recently wrote in the National Review
that a pretty and accomplished wife was an
essential for every deputy monarch in these
parts. What then is the position of Lord Hope-
toun or Sir Robinson, or Sir Norman, or any
other such when his essential packs up her
bonnets and things and cuts the country ? He
becomes practically useless. He is but the dis-
consolate shadow of a vanished substance, and
yet this empty apparition draws his salary as
though he were still a great vital principle.
The matter must be looked into rightaway. If
a so-called Governor is billeted on us for the
sake of his wife, in whom all the important
functions of vice-regality are vested, what’s the
good of him as a grass-widower ? Rise up, Aus-
tralia ! Stretch your hand across the sea and
clench it in the face of Knutseord, or some-
body, until he explains why the genuine Gover-
nors are allowed to leave us without any visible
means of social, political and Imperial support
except an exploded fiction in trousers who grabs
the bawbees of a deserted people.

Loaded Dice.
Smidt, the foreigner, tried at Wagga Circuit
Court for murdering John Young Taylor, has
been in custody ever so many months, and has
all the while been most effectively prosecuted
by the police and the newspapers; we have
even seen it alleged in the press that a gaol
official (who, so far as we can perceive, has not
taken the trouble to deny the reports), has
been letting his tongue run outside concerning
certain discrepancies between statements made
by prisoner at different dates since his arrest.
And yet, when this miserable Smidt was
arraigned it was officially discovered that he
had no money wherewith to pay for his
defence, and the Crown then—at 11.59 J
p.m., so to speak—assigned him the ser-
vices of a junior barrister. As the Crown
must have known all along that the prisoner
was a pauper, and that he was locked up in
gaol without the chance of communicating
(save through the medium of the prosecution’s
henchman, the police) with any witnesses he
might have to call, it might surely have had the
decency, the humanity, to afford him earlier
facilities for preparing to cast the dice of Law.
The brief for the prosecution was no doubt
ready weeks ago. The theory is that the State
has no especial wish for the conviction of any
individual, and that it only desires to sec
justice done. How, in the name of all that is
true and manly, can justice be done in the cir-
cumstances under which Smidt appeared at the
bar? To treat thus a man accused of a capital
crime is infamous ; it is a relic of barbarism to
which the public are unhappily accustomed, but
which, could they regard it with any but the
eyes of hoary precedent, would be scouted as a
revolting crime. Smidt is understood to be a
German, and if this be liqw does it happen
that we db not find the German Consul-Genera!
protesting against the brutal treatment meted
out to this foredoomed citizen of his powerful
country ? There was at one time in Sydney a
generous man (his name was never divulged)
who, out of his own pocket, provided proper
means of defence for every moneyless prisoner
on trial for his life. That philanthropist is now
dead and gone. Is the State too mean to stand
in his shoes ?
John Bellin, the Melbourne auctioneer, sits
limp and desolate in his dungeon cell, wonder-
ing why the Law sentenced him to five years
imprisonment, instead of condemning him to the
healthful three-months' seclusion allotted to
Town-councillor Geddes. The two cases bare a
strong family resemblance up to a certain point.
Both Geddes and Bet.t.tn were paragons of
prayer and respectability, and each took ad-
vantage of his position to embezzle the funds of
certain societies “ without mentioning of it”—as
Coombes in “ The Silver King ” would say. In
the subsequent matter of tearful repentance there
was nothing to choose between these misguided
lambs. Their unanimity of regret was no less
remarkable than touching. Bellin, however,
disgraced himself by merely filching as many
hundreds of pounds as Geddes sneaked thou-
sands, and as he furthermore neglected to be a
drunken Rechabite his resemblance to the other
shining light may be said to have broken down
at two mitigating circumstances. Thus it
happened, doubtless, that Bellin got five year's,
whilst Geddes was called upon to pay only five
per cent, of that penalty, and the former is
herewith exhorted to take his skilly in a spirit
of resignation and acknowledge his sin in
embezzling so little by comparison with the
Municipal Rechabite who kept his bottle on the
chimbley-piece and put his, lips to it when so
dispoged.
The “Book-Purchasers’ Protection Act” just
passed by the New South Wales Legislature,
contains the following clause, moved by an
attorney:—
In any action hereafter arising in any Court on any
contract for the purchase of such printed matter whether
entered into before or after the passing of this Act, the
Court may determine the value of the said printed matter,
proof of which shall be on the vendor.
In other words, the Act says that where a pur-
chaser has contracted in writing to buy a book
at a certain stated price and to pay for it on
delivery, he is at liberty to appeal to a Court
and ask it to fix a lower price. This clumsy
and immoral piece of retrospective legislation
will, The Bulletin predicts, give rise to much
unprofitable litigation. How can the vendor
prove the “ value ”of his book ? How can the
value of a book be proved at all ? It is as un-
certain a quantity as the value of a picture, and
as no two men acting independently are likely
either to assess a book or a picture at exactly
the same price, so no two Courts are likely to
agree on such a matter. It does not follow
that because £IO,OOO has been spent in pro-
ducing a book that the book is valuable (for
the producer of it may have been a gilded
idiot), any more than it follows that
because a book only cost £SOO to bring
out it is worth less than the book whose
cost was £IO,OOO. Suppose it is admitted
by defendant that he ordered the book, and the
Court considers the value of same to be over the
amount claimed, will the value in excess of the
claim be awarded to plaintiff? Many of the
books now sold by subscription are not even
written when they are sold to the public, and
supposing that they are produced according to
the written agreement between the parties, is
the defendant to be released from his engage-
ment merely because he has consented to buy a
pig in a poke ? The Book Purchasers’ Protec-
tion Act is clearly in conflict with the common
law. Which law is to prevail ?
Perhaps the saddest sight on earth is a fat
woman trying to look cute.
“ It must be admitted that the Shearers’
Union is a magnificently solid institution,” said a
well-known squatter the other day in Brisbane.

made their own, every man Jack of them would
strip himself of his shirt and a big hunk of the

The proposed Sydney Domestic Servants’
Union rules provide, it is alleged, for eight hours’
work, beginning at 9 a.m.~and therefore knocking
out early morning tea and all such tyrannies. After-
noon tea is also abolished in favour of Bridget’s
afternoon nap. The placing of anything under
lock and key is strictly prohibited. Every even-

Chief Justice Lilley, of Queensland, writes
to a Brisbane paper to complain that his name
has been placed without his permission on the
members’ list of the “ National Conservative
Club,” England. The democratic judge strongly
objects to this “Imperialistic kidnapping,” as he
styles it, this association of the Republican Lilley
with the Monarchical Primrose, and imagines
that this insult to him and his principles has come
from the hands of some “returned” Australian
cad, for the purpose of convicting him of incon-
sistency and discrediting Australian democracy, or
the Judge himself, by a false pretence of expulsion
under the Club’s 10th rule for “conduct in oppo-
sition to the fundamental political principle upon
which the club has been established.” The judge
has “ requested his associate to inform the club
that I have never applied for membership with
them, nor authorised anyone to apply on my
behalf; that lam not a Conservative, and cer-
tainly not an English Conservative, but an Aus-
tralian Nationalist who believes in the future
absolute independence of his country, under no
crown or coronet, but under a government of her
people, by her people, for her people.”

Notwithstanding the unqualified assertion
of the S.M. Herald’s critic No. 2, that Meroy
Merrick is Janet Aohurohs best Sydney imper-
sanation, we are bold enough to style it her worst
and a bad worst, too, for none of its previous im’
personators were gifted with Miss Aohuroh’s
natural endowments, but each gave a less artificial
and more coherent reading. Here and there her
acting was faultless, but just as folks got inter-
ested she would rant like a barn-stormer, rush
round and round the stage like a caged animal,
snort like a halter-hung horse, or work her features
like one strychnine-poisoned. The possibilities of
a magnificent future are being wrecked for want
of intelligent advice and a strong controlling hand.
As Horace Holmoroft. Herbert Flemming acted as
though he thought the part scarcely worthy of his
attention, consequently the audience formed the
opinion at an early stage of the proceedings that
if he were in love with anyone in particular it was
himself, and didn’t feel at all astonished when be
jilted the New Magdalen. Charles Charrington
made desperate efforts to be effective as Julian
Gray, and several of his speeches were creditable
elocutionary efforts, but his curate was of the
carpet- slipper order, not of the muscular
Christian hero brand, and the actor too evi-
dently lacks the training necessary to the
attainment of success in such a character. We
are glad to see that several of the critics
are outspoken enough to acknowledge that Roland
Watts-Phillips’ Grace Rosebery is the best im-
personation of the play ; it is more than that, it is
a very excellent piece of acting. Mabel Tracey is
not well placed as Lady Janet Roy, but Stirling
White, Henry Hoyte, and Frank Harcourt, were
effective in the small parts of the prologue. “ The
Long Strike ” by the late Boucicault, will be
staged at Her Majesty’s on Saturday, when
William Rignold will impersonate the mill-hand
with the dialect of which he is such a master.

The production of “ Chilperic ” having
been delayed until Wednesday owing to the
necessity for further rehearsal, not the less worthy
motive that has been rumoured, “Paul Jones”
was revived for six nights to business slightly
better than that prevailing at the tail-end of the
“Boccaccio” run. The name-part was taken
during the first three nights by Marian Burton,
and during the last three by Sydney Deane, who
was fairly successful. But his popularity would
scarcely sustain the test of a long run in the
character.

Janet Achurch takes a benefit on Saturday

play in two acts of “Camille,” the 8.8. crowd
will play an act of “ D.D.,” Jewett and Oatheart
will put up a scene from “Julius Csesar,” and M.
Poussard, Harry Rickards, and many others will
perform. It is hard to say why Mrs. Charring-
ton should ask—why the public should accord her—
a benefit. During the last three months she has
earned more money than many worthy local per-
formers have in the last five years. Under such
circumstances, in every case it would be more
straightforward for the favourites of fortune to
come before the theatre-going public purely as the
vendors of acceptable theatrical goods and not as
beseeehers for eleemosynary bounty.

The Harry Rickards Co. continue to fill
Sydney School of Arts nightly. The lately-engaged
ballad-singer, Rita Dale, has a fresh and lusty
voice which only requires careful training to be-
come a valuable property. The bagpipe solos of
the kilted Highland dancer, T. M. Mackay, are
somewhat soul-satisfying, but the much-medalled
and high-kilted gentleman has caught on and, as
an evidence of his popularity, the “ bald-heads”

sex. The entrepreneur’s new songs “ Hard Times”
and “How he Carries On” are likely to become
popular. In order to rest Mrs. Rickards, May

The fifth performance of Hazon's Orchestra

interesting by the appearance of a French singer,
Jd. 0. Deslouis, who received a magnificent recep-
tion and is the owner of a highly-cultured bari-

its effect to Australian ears is impaired by the use

former member for Patrick’s Plains in the N.S. W.
Assembly), an Australian native, and dedicated
to Mons. Kowalski by the composer, his pupil.
The composition—albeit somewhat reminisoential
and disfigured by an abrupt “ break ’ -—was
onthusiastically encored and is more pleasing than
some trifles of a similar character that have come
to us over well-known names.

The “ attractive novelty ” which the sar-

recitals has proved a real mascotte. Marian
Burton must never return to comic opera. As she
ensured the success of Santley’s last Melbourne

performances in Sydney, though given at higher
prices, is enhanced to such an extent by her
charming singing that the Centennial Hall is not
nearly large enough for the crowds who went to

Bland Holt’s latest production at Mel-
bourne Alexandra can hardly fail to bring back
more than the big bagfull of shekels expended
upon it. “ London, Day by Day ” contains enough
fun, trouble, character, story, and scenery for two
melodramas of the modern style. _ The plot jumps
off from scratch, and keeps going at top-speed
until it breasts the tape, instead of stopping to get
second breath, or occasionally wandering off the
track and losing itself. Likening the company of
thirty-one performers to Price’s Mounted
they may be said to “aim low and effectively,
with the result that the audience are “laid out’
in admiring heaps and have to be dragged away
from the scene of slaughter. These thirty-one
creations of Sims and Pet ti f t form a representa-
tive cockney combination, with an innocent
ticket-of-le&ve girl at the head of affairs, ihe
usual untold gold falls due to the afflicted pansy,
and an evil-minded foreigner wants to marry her
in consequence, but his deserted wife goes around
warning people until he strews the floor with her
remains, after which vengeance pursues the wrong
individual for a while previous to collaring the
man of sin and leaving the other fellow in the
arms of the first girl. A gaudy Yiddisher plays a
cheerful hand in most of the wickedness, and most
of the others evince a rollicking disposition, unless
they happen to be magistrates, or policemen, or
mere “citizens,” in which cases they incline to
gloom. The first of eleven scenes is laid in
Jermyn-street, the last at St. Katherine’s Docks.
They are generally within the radius of Covent
Garden’s vegetable aroma, and not one goes fur-
ther afield than Hampton Court. Therefore,
'* London, Day by Day ” hangs together better
than dramas which stretch from Middlesex to
Egvpt and require the leading characters to meet
one another promiscuous-like in about thirteen
different regions.

The average strength of acting is remark-
able, considering that two dozen and seven souls
have a say in the matter, albeit the say of some is
brief. Of the principals Bland Holt, Baker and
Maggie Knight, are better than Walter Howe,
Albert Norman and Mrs. Bland Holt. The latter
was never cut out for a cynical deserted wife,
the men suffer from too much front teeth and a
superfluity of eye respectively. Polly Emery is
quite excellent as a gutter-snipe, pretty Virginia
Vivienne seems to be coming on nicely, and her
stage suitor is fairly deserving of such a delicious
mash. H. Plummer, although lacking in repose
and shirtcuff, strikes one as a promising young
man, and a more or less favourable mention of the
remaining two dozen is crowded out.

Maggie Moore’s re-appearance ensured a

Lord High Executioner to grief with the force of
her languorous flop upon his chest) there was

Attenuated audiences still dot themselves
over the desert vastness of the Royal, but
“Famine” and Hubert O’Grady are to be with-
drawn after Friday. A piece of idiocy not
generally noticed is the calling a girl “ Lady
Alice” because her father is a baronet. O’Grady’s
ignorance of the laws relating to “handles” is
nothing much against him, but the fact that he
hadn’t been advised to remove such a glaring error
from the playbill makes one speculate upon the
class of audience he writes dramas for. “Lady
Alice ” (daughter of Sir Richard) gives the author
clean away in one line. On Saturday Mr. Martin
Simonsen experiments with an English Opera
Company, who meditate a further attack upon
poor old “Maritana.”

the Examination Act, from “ School,” the
first thrill of “Robbery Under Arms,” the
Trial Scene from “Merchant of Venice,” and
“The Goose with the Golden Eggs,” an aged
farce which offers Elton and Royce an
opportunity to chip in their services. His
Hexcellency has contributed his radiant patronage,
and the ghost of Shakespeare is expected to drop
in during the evening to express his immortal
approval of Miln’s plucky efforts to popularise
classic drama amongst a leg-loving people, ihe
tragedian’s next move is to be in the direction of
India’s coral strands, and after he has rounded off
Friday’s performance with a spaohe, his Mel-
bourne friends will wave a fond adieu.

G. 0, Miln was examined in Melbourne
Insolvency Court on Monday. They couldn’t
stop him when he once started on his own mis-
fortunes. Here are a few gems from a long ex-
planation delivered in tragic and pathetic tones.
Brisbane was a brilliant success—£'ls after six
weeks in a tropical climate. Sydney was a failure,
and he cleared out as quickly as he could. No
one wanted him now. A Shaksperian in the
Australian colonies was like the Great Eastern
ten miles inland. Melbourne Opera House was a
first-class theatrical coffin. The syndicate that
launched him in Tasmania gave him £2O, and
pocketed over £2OO. Certainly, his wife drew a
salary. What an absurd question ! She was
one. of the best leading ladies in Aus-
tralia. He couldn’t say what he made
out of “Othello” in Melbourne. No, not m this
world or the next. But he hoped to meet counsel
for the trustee in the next world, all the same. A
lot of fellows with blue papers used to wait for
him outside the stage-door in Melbourne. He
never had any desire to see them. All he wanted
was to go and get a living and be square with the
world. That was the gist of it. The moral is
obvious. Miln will probably play in Adelaide.
He swears he’ll never dodge his creditors. I hey 11
be told all his movements.

Luscombe Searelle’s “ new ” comic opera,
“The Black Rover,” which he is producing in
London, appears to be simply “ Isadora ” under
another name. The latter play he brought out at
Sydney Opera House about five years ago. If
we remem D6r rightly, the public didn t hanker
much after “Isadora,” which ran for one conse-
cutive week. The leading parts were held by
Grade Plaisted, Lithgow James, and Oily Peer-
ing—the latter playing an old imbecile whose age
increased each time he made his appearance until
ultimately he announced “he was over 10 million
years old,” and then the curtain fell. A dreamy
hymn-tune, which was dragged in about three
times in each act, "was the only number in the
opera that “ caught on ” at all.

If the ordinary cablegram-manufacturer
can out-do Ananias, where does the theatrical
cablegram-manufacturer come in. and howoften are
the messages sent by the artistes whose tremendous
success they record, themselves ? On theinormng
after the first production in Melbourne some time
ago of a new opera bouffe, a certain lady who
played a principal part was with her husband in
the Bourke - street telegraph - office. As they
took no trouble to modulate their voices, an
audience of some dozen were speedily aware that
it was a question of dispatching a cablegram to
London recording the event of the previous night.
After a protracted discussion, in which, however,
hubby took little part, the fair lady decided that
the only expression equal to the occasion was
“unparalleled success,” and, with many lingering
looks and an evident desire to put in a little more
jam, this was eventually sent off. Charley
Warner and Emily Eitzroy, are you listening ?

Mrs. Brown-Potter found herself in front
of a serious difficulty on the last night of
“Hero and Leander ” at Melbourne Princess’.
She was doing a forlorn soliloquy about the
absence of Leander. who had gone out to have an
ancient Greek drink, or was otherwise unavoid-
ably absent; but just at the most forlorn part of
the atory Leander himself put his head in at the
window. He was nearly ten minutes ahead of
time, so the weeping maidof Greece calmly ignored
the fact that he was there, and kept on asking
why he didn’t come. There was just two feet of
space between them, but Hero openly stated that
he wan far, far away, and gave way to grief over
his absence. Then the gallery hollered out that he
was just a-coming in at the window, and Leander
smiled a harassed smile, but Hero went on wit a
her alarmingly improbable statements. i tea
yer he’s gittin’ in at the window,” said the clarion
voice from near the roof, and Leander looked as it
he wished be was dead, and didn’t know whether
to hang on or simply state that he would call m
later. There was no joy in the meeting that night;.
Leander had caught the wrong steamer from Asia

Mrs. Gown-Bought’er sprang into popular
favour in Adelaide with three back somersaults
and a handspring—figuratively speaking, of course.
The house is nightly packed as if with potatoes in
a sack, and the press has fairly gushed over her
curly juvenile. The alleged criticism of the Ad-
vertiser was unqualified slobber from leading line
to wind up; and had a strong managerial twain?
about it, heightened by a soupgon of Sillery and
fat natives. The Register, in discreetly worded
criticisms, certainly suggests, in a half-hearted
way, that Mrs. B.P. is not a heaven-born actress,
but tins assertion is so qualified with “ buts ” and
“ ifa ” and so overlaid with jam that the outside
public are completely mystified. Meantime, with

Miss Myra Kemble has purchased the Australian rights
or Mr, F. W. Broughton’s new comedy, “ A Peer of the

true to life —an awful ruffian.
From Illustrated London News, March Ist, 1851, “ On
Thursday, Mr. William Brough (one of Brough Brothers,
authors of the successful burlesques recently acted at the
Havmarket and Adelphi Theatres) was married at St.
pancras New Church, to Miss Annie Bonier, the clever
vocalist of the Haymarket. There were present on the
occasion several literati, amongst whom were Sir Edward
Bulwer Lytton, Bart., Mr. Douglas Jerrold, Mr. Charles
Dillon, Mr. Benjamin Webster, &c.”
Elton is to be the Duke of Plaza-Toro in “The Gon-
doliers.” It will be one of his biggest hits. “ Although
I am, unhappily, in straitened circumstances at present,
my social influence is something enormous ; and a com-
pany, to be called the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Limited, is in
course of formation to work me. An influential direc-
torate has been secured, and 1 shall myself join the
Board after allotment.” The Duke owns nothing but a
wife and daughter, and a “private drum.”-
Santley’s habit of singing with his toes turned in—also,
rising onto the points of his feet whenever he vvishes to
snve greater volume to his upper-register F—is not a
soothing trick. The first destroys the of the

w'ho would otherwise be flawless, while the latter makes

During one of the Bairnsfather entertainments lately,
at the close of the evening the company sang “ Auld Lang
Syne,” and when they came to the verse beginning ‘ And

holding aloft a glass and a bottle of mountain dew, which
he offered to Mr. Bairnsfather. The latter accepted the
offer and, shaking hands, drank, amidst the cheers of
the audience, the affair putting everyone in the best of

“To contend that Miss Belle Bilton married Lord Dunlo
for his virtues, latent and general worth, would be merely
to provoke a smile. A dashing music-hall singer is not to
be captivated by a man who has no money, and is unin-
telligent in mind and insignificant in body ; but she may-
be by his title, if he have one. And so it undoubtedly
was in this case. Only a week or two before the marriage
we read more than once, of Lord Dunlo being summoned
in the police-court for small fares owing to cabmen. Miss
Bilton caught at the idea of one day sitting with the
Peeresses in the House of Lords. She has scored all
round.” —London paper.

refuge in the theatre to avoid the importunities of people
for a full and particular account of what he had seen, for
there prevailed a general belief that the man would not be
hanged. Just as the man had taken his seat the fourth

“The Conventional Lies
of our Civilisation.”
THE ECONOMIC LIE.— CHAPTER II. CONTINUED.
BY MAX NORDAU.
Thk college graduate thinks himself of too much
account to descend into and be lost in the lowest
class of society, by voluntarily assuming the trade
of a manual-labourer, and according to the ideas
prevalent in society he is correct. He demands of
the world that he be supported as a master, not
support himself, like a slave. But the world has
only a limited demand for the kind of work which
the college-bred man considers suitable for him.
Hence, in the older civilised countries, at least
one-half of the graduates are condemned to spend
their lives in hoping and envying, obtaining none
of life’s blessings, fighting hard for the small
amount of daily bread they require, and often
going hungry, standing beside the over-loaded,
groaning table of the upper ten thousand, while
suffering the pangs of semi-starvation. Certain
friends of humanity, of that stamp who consider
wars and pestilences as blessings for the human
race, because they leave more room and better
conditions of existence for those remaining alive,
these people express their convictions that culti-
vation is an injury to mankind, that the increase
in the number of intermediate and high schools is
an attempt to destroy the happiness of the masses,
because in them more discontented professional
failures, future barricade-fighters aud dynamiters
are being raised and let loose upon the community.
As things are now these reasoners are in the
right. As long as the college-bred young man con-
siders himself disgraced by manual labour, because
the labourer is despised, as long as he sees in his
diploma an instrument by which to compel society
to rally to his support, and as long as he considers
himself entitled by his education to the parasitic
life of the wealthy classes —as long as these con-
ditions endure, his education will bring him far
more unhappiness, in five cases out of ten, than he
would ever experience if he were without it and
leading the life of a handicraftsman or even of a
day-labourer.
* * *
This can only be remedied by giving back to
education its natural role. It must be its own
object. We must learn to consider that a culti-
tivated mind is, in itself, a sufficient reward for the
efforts made to get the cultivation, that we have
no right to expect any other reward for these
efforts, and that its possession does not relieve us
in any way from the duty of productive labour. A
cultivated mind has a fuller and richer conscious-
ness of its Ego, it grasps better the phenomena of
the world and of life, it can appreciate and enjoy
the beauties of art and of literature, and its exis-
tence gives its possessor a far more liberal and in-
tensive life in every respect than that led by the
ignorant. We are ungrateful if, in addition to
these priceless blessings for the inner life, we
demand of education that it should also provide
us with our daily bread : this should be the task
of our hands. But if, on one hand, the man of
culture ought not to despise the immediate pro-
duction of articles for the market, society, on the
other hand, should make education accessible to
all those capable of receiving and profiting by it.
Compulsory school attendance is only a weak be-
ginning. How can poor men afford to send their
children to school until they are 10 or 12 years old,
when they are unable to feed and clothe them
during that time, and the little ones must labour
for their own support ? And is it justifiable, is it
consistent, for the State to say : “ You must learn
to read and write; thus far shalt thou go and no
farther?” Why does compulsory school attend-
ance cease at the elementary grades ? Why does
it not extend to the higher branches ? Ignorance
is either an infirmity in the individual and conse-
quently in the community, or else it is not. If it
is no infirmity, why are the children compelled to
attend the primary and elementary schools? If it
is, why is it not cured completely by a complete
and rounded education ? Is not knowledge of the
laws of nature as valuable as the multiplication-
table ? The coming voters, in whose hands lie the
destinies of their native land, do not they need
any acquaintance with history, politics and
national economy ? Can they get the full benefit
of the art of reading which they have mastered
if they are not instructed in, nor even introduced
to, the master-pieces of prose and poetry in their
national literature? The intermediate schools
provide for this, at least. Why, then, is not
attendance upon the intermediate schools made
compulsory ? The obstacle is a material one. The
poor man who has already experienced great
difficulty in supporting his child until he graduates
from the primary school, would find it utterly im-
possible to carry the burden of his maintenance
until he had reached an advanced age, until his
eighteenth or twentieth year. He is compelled
by sheer necessity to convert the labouring
power of his child into money at the
earliest possible moment. In order to have
the benefits of the intermediate schools shared
by as many pupils as attend the primary schools,
the labour of the scholars should be organised and
utilised, as is the case in some educational insti-
tutions in the United States, where the pupils
carry on a farm or work at some manual trade, in
connection v/(Jh their studies, with sufficient
success and pecuniary returns, aided by outside
benevolent contributions to a certain extent, to
support themselves during their school-life. A
far better and more consistent plan would be for
the community to supply not only instruction but
the entire material support of the scholars during
their years of study. “ That would be pure Com-
munism !” exclaims some obstinate adherent of
that organised egotism which we call the existing
science of political economy.
# * *
I might flatter him by disclaiming the horrid
word and saying : “No, that would not be Com-
munism, but the solidarity of the community.”
But I disdain to pJay hide-and-seek with thought,
and thus I say frankly : Yes, it would be a bit of
Communism. But are we not living in a complete
state of Communism ? Is it not Communism for
the State to provide compulsory education for the
whole generation of children from their sixth to
their twelfth year ? Is not the mental food thus
provided for them one kind of food ? Does it not
cost money ? Is it not the community which
supplies this money? And the standing army?
Is not this also founded upon pure Communism ?
Does not the community support in this way a
whole generation of young men between their
twentieth and twenty-third year, and not with
mental food alone, but with actual food and cloth-
ing, house and home ? Why should it be more diffi-
cult or more unreasonable for the State to support
a million children during their entire school-life as
far as the university, than to support half a million
young men during their years of military service ? #
The expense? It would be no greater than the
expense of keeping up the army. And the main-
tenance and development of an army is of no
greater importance to the safety and prosperity of
the nation than the more complete education of
the generation growing up around us. And
besides, why cannot the two aims be combined ?
Why cannot the State feed and clothe the entire
male generation until the seventeenth or
eighteenth year as it now feeds and clothes the
regular army, and during this time in connection
with the primary and intermediate schooling
given to them let them be receiving their military
instruction ? The national labour would gain
vastly by the substitution of the less costly arms
of the scholar-soldiers for those of the strong and
trained young men of .twenty to twenty-three, of
whose valuable labour the community is now
deprived. The actual gain in this way to the
nation would represent an amount of money suffi-
cient to cover the entire extra expense of the
soldier army over the present army, whose
capability for labour is condemned to three years
of unproductiveness, at the very blossoming-time
of its development.
* * *
Such a system, to be complete, must be founded
upon a certain other con-
dition. Not every mine
is capable of receiving and
assimilating the higher
and highest branches of
learning. If the State is
to take charge of the
whole population of
scholars throughout the
country and thus make
education possible to all,
even to the son of the
poorest man, then it must
take care that its bene-
fits are not wasted upon
those who are unworthy
or incapable of profiting
by them. At the close
of each school year a
strict and exhaustive ex-
amination of the scholars
should take place, and
those only be allowed
to enter the grade above
who were able to sustain
the examination. In this
way the talentless scholar
would drop out of school
after having acquired the
elementary branches,
which are as much of a
mental load as he is
capable of bearing; the
mediocre intelligence
would leave school after
having acquired part or
the whole of the interme-
diate branches, while
only the pupils possessing
real talent would work
their way into the highest
educational
the scientific, technical
and art academies. By
this system liberal educa-
tion would become the
property of the entire
people; instead of being,
as it is now, a privilege
only enjoyed by the
wealthy classes. Manual
labour would be no longer
synonymous with lack of
'fO’.:> a
If i?SS t'C*&
iAf3>r f\ r
cultivation, and theedueated youngman would incur
no disgrace if he earned his livelihood by the
direct production of articles from the market.
The overcrowding of the liberal professions by
presuming and unauthorised mediocrities would be
prevented. Genuine talent that had been obliged
to display and prove its authenticity and its claim
to the title in a dozen competitive examinations
of constantly increasing severity would find in its
diploma the absolute guarantee of an honourable
livelihood ; the problematic existences would dis-
appear and shabby gentility cease to exist. This
system would thus be found a complete cure for
one of the most dangerous wounds in the body of
society.
* * *
One picture of the political economy of our civi-
lisation in the preceding pages included the
privileged classes, the men of wealth and leisure,
who live on the labour of others, the group of
college-bred young men who consider that their
possession of a diploma entitles them to live the
life of a parasite on the working classes, the same
as the millionaire’s wealth entitles him, and the
proletaires, the lowest class in society, torn from
the soil intended by nature to support man, with-
out property of any kind, toiling for a mere sub-
sistence. What a tragic figure in the midst of our
civilisation ! What a pregnant criticism of the
world’s progress, this factory employe ! The lines
are often quoted in which La Bruyere describes
the peasant vassal of his day : “A kind of gloomy,
timid animal, emaciated, living in dens, eating
grass on all-fours, covered with rags, feeling
affirighted at the approach of other men, and yet
bearing the semblance of a human being, and yet
being a man.” This description will also apply to
the day-labourer of Europe. Miserably fed,
principally on potatoes and the refuse of the meat-
shops in the shape of sausages, poisoned with bad
liquors, which give him the deceptive sensation of
a satisfied appetite and renewed strength, badly
dressed in blouse and overalls which proclaim
him from afar as the poor man, the degraded
social being, condemned to physical uncleanliness
by his lack of money, he hides his wretchedness
in the darkest, filthiest corners of the great cities.
He not only has no share in the finer provisions
that the earth brings forth, but he is also partially
or totally deprived of light and a,ir which one
would suppose were at the disposal of every living
being in unlimited quantities. His insufficient
nourishment and the excessive demands upon his
labouring forces, exhaust his vital energies to such
an extent that his children are predisposed to
rachitis and he himself succumbs to an early
death, frequently preceded by some chronic
disease. His unhealthy dwelling place fastens
upon him and his offspring the curses of scrofula
and consumption. He is a kind of forlorn post
which every disease tries in turn to master. He
is worse off than the slave of ancient times;
oppressed the same, dependent in the same way
upon master and overseer, he yet gets nothing in
return for the loss of his freedom, not even the
food and shelter given to a domestic animal.
Another point in which his wretchedness is more
acute than that of the ancient bond-slave, is the
fact that he is conscious of it and also of his
dignity and natural rights as a man. He is even
worse off than the savage wandering through the
primeval forests of America or camping on the
grassy plains of Australia, for, like him, depen-
dent solely upon himself, like him, living from
hand to mouth, day by day, and suffering the
pangs of hunger if he lies idle fora few hours, he is,
unlike him, deprived of that keen delight which is
produced by the complete expansion of all the phy-
sical and mental forces in the struggle to overcome
natural obstacles, animals and men. He is more-
over obliged to pay over a considerable share of
his earnings, which are so far from being sufficient
for his support, to the community in exchange for
chains and blows. Civilisation, which promised
him liberty and prosperity, has not only refused
to keep its promise, but excludes him directly
from its highest blessings. Modern sanitary
science which has made the home of the rich so
comfortable and healthy, has not paid any atten-
tion to his lurking place. He is far more uncom-
fortable in the fourth-class coach when travelling
by rail than when he used to trudge along on foot
or ride behind some broken-down horse in his rude
cart. He never hears or knows anything of the
triumphs of scientific investigation. The produc-
tion of the creative arts, the poetical master-works
of his native tongue are sealed books to him,
because he has never been trained to comprehend
them. Even the labour-saving mechanical appli-
ances which ought to prove such a blessing to him,
have rather increased than diminished his slavery.
* * *
It is certainly a great forward stride in the pro-
gress and happiness of mankind that the forces of
nature can now be harnessed and employed in
the performance of all brute labour. What dis-
tinguishes man above all other living beings is not
his muscular system, but his brain. As a source
of strength he is inferior to the mule and the ox,
and if mechanical labour is all that is required of
him, he is degraded to be a mere beast of burden.
But machinery has not proved as yet the saviour,
the liberator and the ally of the workmen as was
first hoped, but on the contrary, has made him its
slave. _ Now as much as ever before, does his
value in the industrial arts depend directly upon
his muscular strength, and he has thus become
the weak, imperfect and abject competitor of
machinery. Deprived of his share of the soil, he
is not able to supply his wants by raising the pro-
ducts of nature ; submission to the inevitable is
his only resource. He only becomes aware of his
fellowship with mankind by the duties laid upon
him, for which he receives no privileges in return.
When he is not able to exchange his labour for
money, or when disease or old age put an end to
his work temporarily or permanently, the com-
munity looks after him, indeed. It gives him
alms if he takes to begging, it lays him on the cot
in the hospital if he has a fever, it puts him—
sometimes—in a poor-house, if he is too old and
feeble for anything else; but how impatiently,
how grudgingly, does it fulfill these duties ! It
offers its unwelcome guest more humiliations than
mouthfuls. While it is satisfying his hunger and
covering his nakedness, it is declaring that it is a
disgrace to accept these benefits from its hands
and affects the most profound contempt for the
unfortunates who are suing for its bounty. The
labouring classes find it impossible to lay by any-
thing for days of no work or of sickness and old
age. How can they have a surplus when even the
necessaries of life are lacking? They cannot
think of demanding wages above what they need
to satisfy their most pressing wants, because, as the
number of these disinherited beings is too large
and is constantly increasing, there are sure to be
plenty who would accept their situations at anv
wages that would keep them from dying at one*
of starvation. J s nce
* * *
These circumstances are utterly beyond the con-
trol of the labouring man. He may toil with the
utmost diligence, with the greatest exertion of his
vital energies, he can never earn more than is
sufficient to supply his most immediate wants—
aside from the fact that the lowest wages now
paid represent the expenditure of all the work-
man’s energies. On the contrary : the more he
works, the more intolerable does his position
become. This sounds paradoxical, but it is never-
theless true. The more that the operative
produces, the lower goes the selling-price of his
productions, while his wages remain the same, if
they do not become less. Thus he spoils his own
market by straining every nerve, and depreciates
the value of his own labour. This phe-
nomenon would not occur if the produc-
tion of the great manufacturing industries was
regulated by the demand. Then over-production
would never occur, the price of the articles would
never be depressed by an over-supply, and the
producing labouring man would be paid higher
wages for an increased amount of work. But
Capital perverts this natural operation of the
forces of political economy. A man builds a
factory and commences the manufacture of goods,
not because that he has become convinced that
a demand hitherto unsatisfied exists for the
goods he is to produce, but because he has
capital, for which he is seeking a profitable in-
vestment, and also because he has some neighbour
who has accumulated wealth with his factory.
Thus individual whims or want of judgment, in-
stead of the laws of political economy, decide the
investment of capital. The market is thus
flooded with an over-supply of certain manufac-
tured goods because some man has been following
a false trail in his mad chase after the Almighty
Dollar. The mistake brings its own punishment,
it is true. The manufacturer offers his goods at
lower and lower prices, until they no longer pay
the expenses of production, and then he is finan-
cially wrecked. All the other manufacturers of
that same article go down with him, and that
branch of production is involved in a national or
world-wide financial crisis. But the real victim is
the factory employe. As the price of the manu-
factured article sinks lower and lower, his wages
are decreased in proportion until the manufacturer
has exhausted his capital. And when the unequal
battle between supply and demand ends in the
victory of the forrn.er and production ceases, then
he is left entirely without bread, for a longer or
shorter time as the case may be. These are the
roles played by the manufacturer and the operative
in the great manufacturing industries. The latter
makes it possible for the former to accumulate
a great capital. This capital seeks profits and
believes they can be found in the opening of
additional factories. This leads to over-produc-
tion and increased competition, with their train of
depression of prices and reduction of wages, clos-
ing with the crisis which deprives the operative of
the opportunity of earning anything. Thus the
industrial slave makes tvs master rich, while his
own daily bread is reduced in quantity day by day
and finally taken away from him entirely.' Can
there be a more beautiful illustration of the way
in which the existing conditions of the economic
world conform to truth, justice and propriety !

Patchett Martin writes, in his new book
on Australia, that Marcus Clarke’s mother was an

he is apparently nobody.
Mr. Eben Atherton, the well-known
Sydney medico, is dead. He steered a diplomatic
course between the homoeopathic cranks and the

It is stated that Governor Kintore made a
big deal out of Block 10 shares, a few days ago.
Altogether, he is supposed to have pocketed nearly
£50,000 since Brother Horn, M.P., was made

he gets cablegrams retaining him fifty deep.
Shakespeare left only two daughters,
whose children died without issue. We read that
“ probably the nearest relative to the great poet
now living is one Thomas Hart, a resident of Aus-

Shakespeare’s sister Joan.” Who is Mr. Hart?
Henry Tudor Shadforth, a pleasant old
gentleman for 37 years Usher of the Black Rod
to the N.S.W. Legislative Council, died at Manly
on 25th September. He was formerly in the 57th
Regiment, and commanded in the Western dis-
trict. He married a sister of Sir Alfred Stephen.
The Australian workman doesn’t believe
in Champion, firstly, because he dresses like a
member of Parliament; secondly, because he is
suspected of having a roving commission from the
German Emperor; and thirdly and chiefly,
because he avowedly has a literary commission
from the Times.
“ The N.S. Wales Executive will to-day
appoint 15 Crown prosecutors for the forthcoming
Circuit Court sittings.” It is to be hoped that
among them will not be included the man who,
when wayback a little time ago, drank a bottle of
rum right off and then asked for a quart of beer
“ because he felt thirsty.”
The Earl of Jersey is “a commonplace,
rich man,” who has acquired his politics, diplo-
macy, and statesmanship in the Paymaster-
General’s Office,” says an English democratic
paper. According to Gov. Oarington’s notions of
colonial governorships, Jersey is now joining the
Spendmaster-General’s Office.
A niember of the Queensland Upper
House has developed a mysterious complains
which is arousing a lot of curiosity. The doctors
are treating him with copper and borax and other
strangely violent remedies. An impression is
abroad that the patient is suffering from moth
and rust and blue-mouldiness.
Lady Colin Campbell, the whilom famous,

Her latest is a trip to Hampton Court, where she
overhauled the bath in which Queen Anne used to

A really touching farewell sermon was
preached by the new Bishop of Sydney in Birken-
head. His text was, “I will hope continually
and yet praise thee more and more. ” He referred
in a manly way to his departed wife, saying that
on the day of their engagement, 21 years ago, in
Birkenhead, they read that psalm together, and
the text would be cut on her tombstone.
Done to death by slanderous tongues
appears to have been the Rev. Wardrop, who
died last week in Sydney. He had the pluck to
stand up for Revs. Strong and Hods before the
Melbourne Presbytery, wherefore he got ousted
from a snug Geelong parsonage, and he has gone
to an untimely grave. A Wardrop cannot afford
to say in Australia what a Robertson-Smith, or
Principal Caird, writes with impunity in Scplatnd.
Pat Hanna, ex-Victorian M.P., died lately.
In old time he worked the ferry, at the wharf,
and he has often been referred to as a marvellous
self-made moneybags, but the fact is he was edu-
cated as an engineer. Once he was badly beaten
at an election, and made a characteristic speech,
which the local paper called "P. Hanna Out of
Tune.” He seemed very fond of the fun of sending
poor prisoners to quod from the City Police Court
bench.
POLITICAL POINTS
The sooner several N.S.W. members, who
breathe naught but slaughter, get a cowhiding
the better it will be for the country.
According to the Hanbard record, Bruce
Smith was interrupted 195 times while making a
personal explanation in theN.S.W. Assembly, the
other night.
The S.M. Herald, in an evidently in-
spired paragraph, says that Sir Henry Parkes has
not quite abandoned the idea of building the
State House.
Speaking in the N.S.W. Legislative As-
sembly, the other night, a member performed the
feat of telling five deliberate lies in eight lines|of
reported matter.
The loss of the Broken Hill traffic during
the strike is so serious to South Australia that
there is almost certain to be a deficit at the end of
the present year.
There are now in these waters 2500 Im-
perial sailors. When the additional ships of the
Australian squadron arrive this number will be
increased to 3400.
It is pointed out that Premier Parkes, who
now complains of obstruction, in 1886 led a little
party which, while in opposition, moved 24 ad-
journments in 48 sittings.
Out of the £70,000 annual cost of the
defence force of Queensland, £20,000 evaporates in
JV W OP> N
salaries and expenses of management to the officers
kindly provided by England !
Portugal simmers. The hereditary peerage
has been abolished, but the King can make 100
life-peers, and the Liberals are going to stop that
too. Manhood suffrage is all but gained.
Those Victorian members who growl at
Hansard should take the trouble to ascertain how
hard the official reporters work. The life of a
Hansard man is simply hell upon earth.
The Twentieth Century forcibly points
out that George, having clearly shown in “ Pro-
gress and Poverty ” the absurdity of titles to land-
possession, afterwards turned round and defended
them.
The value (unimproved) of the land held
by absentees, in the city of Adelaide alone,
amounts to £2,337,000. This sum is divided
amongst 66 absentees, and four alone each hold
land over £lOO,OOO.
Says Rev. H. L. Jackson, of St. James’,
Sydney“ I verily believe this strike, whether it
be successful or unsuccessful in immediate result,
will have the effect of actively starting the cause
of pure and absolute nationalism.”
The N.S.W. Legislative Council astonished
the reporters one night last week by attending the
House to the number of 50 ! The cause turned
out to be a division on the Marrickville to Bur-
wood Railway Bill. Agin your own door !
South Australia is suffering a “ recovery.”
The population is larger by 60,000 than it was ten
years ago, yet the spirit-duties have decreased by
£32,000. This is accounted for by most of the
professional temperance-lecturers being in gaol.
“I never assisted to cook a solicitor’s
accounts.” “I never put my mother in gaol. ’
“ I’ll tear out your windpipe.” “ You are a liar.”
“ If you were a Christian, you would be afraid of
being struck dead.”— ■N'.S.W. Legislative Assembly.
Henry George told a London audience
that South Australia leads the world with the
Single-tax. As that province only admits the
principle of a very small levy on unimproved
values, besides levying the income, stamp, and
revenue duties, we fail to see much Single-tax
about it.
, Melbourne Trades-Hall committee refuses
the use of its sacred edifice to the social demo-
crats. It thus stops free discussion on the ground
that the language of the latter body "is absurd.”
How “ absurd ” and impotent seemed the language
of the Trades-Hall committee but a few short
years ago !
If a man who says that those who speak of
“ the reconstruction of society ” are “ fanatics and
fools,” why does Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan remain in
theN.S.W. Parliament? Hoes he consider the
present condition of society perfect? Is bis mind
utterly innocent of designs for improving the con-
dition of the people ?
“In the multitude of councillors there is
safety ” —such is the Bible motto engraved on the
tesselated pavement of the new vestibule at Mel-
bourne Parliament Houses. The meaning of this
aphorism, a grim joke of old Solomon’s, is not
generally understood. The safety is to the coun-
cillors, not to the counselled.
Says Senator Ingalls: “The purification
of politics is an iridescent dream. Government
is force. Politics is a battle for supremacy.
Parties are the armies. The decalogue and the
golden rule have no place in a political campaign.
The object is success. To defeat the antagonist
and expel the party in power is the purpose.”
The Trades and Labour Council of each Aus-
tralian province will, at next general election,
be the headquarters of Radical poll tics. The parlia-
mentary committee of the N.S.W. Council are
preparing a series of questions directly affecting
Labour to be put to candidates, who will be sup-
ported or opposed on the basis of their answers.
A respectable Sydney suburban tradesman
complains that he has been boycotted and ruined
through becoming a special constable. The
Bulletin is sorry to hear this, and can only
ascribe the man’s misfortune to the folly and
wickedness of the authorities in so arranging the
special-constabulary appointments as to set class
against class.
Wonderful and chameleonic are the
changes in Patterson, Victorian Customs Com-
missioner. This is the man who, under General
Berry (who now decorates the marble steps of the
Carlton Club or such places), declared that the
Government were going in for “broken heads and
flaming houses,” and yet Patterson would now
adorn the Toriest section of the Employers’
Union.
“ Ex-Diplomatist” tells how the Prince of
Wales converted Mundella, M.P., from a furious
Republican to a rank Tory. Mundella was to
address his constituents at Sheffield, but Wales
met him on the railway platform, introduced him
to Alexandra, and told him to tell the electors
they had pleasant memories of Sheffield. This
strangled the Republican, albeit he was the son of
an Italian carbonaro.
Watch the revolution in Belgium. The
dominant party is boldly named the Clerical, and
holds power only by resisting a fair suffrage. The
Clericals have 97 votes in the Chamber, against
the_ Opposition 41, but a suffrage on the French
basis, or even on that of England, would instantly
sweep the Clericals off the board. England virtu-
ally governs Belgium, and the English Conserva-
tives back up the reactionaries.
A telegram to the Australian daily press
states that when John Dillon, O’Brien and other
Ms.P. were charged at Tipperary last Thursday
with conspiracy to incite tenants not to pay rent
they refused to answer to their names, “ formally
protesting that the bench was unfairly composed. ”
Now, The Bulletin is ready to wager that what
Dillon and Co. said was not that the bench was
“unfairly composed,’’but that it was “packed”—
which in all human probability was the case.
“ Packed ” is too ugly a word for the cable-man.
The strike is evidently deranging the
Melbourne Aegus. “Really,” says she, “some
atmospheric or other mysterious cause seems to
be at work, compelling all classes to claim that
they have a right to be a law unto themselves.”
The italics (ours) show where the old lady is hurt.
She only wants the privileged classes to be a law
unto themselves. “Privilege,”in the Argus sense,
has got to die by the electricity of socialism.
Socialism, in its true sense, means the “ common
privilege of all classes ” —which is tantamount to
“no privilege,” for this is just the point in the
annulus where extremes meet.
“Labour always precedes wages. Paid
by the day, week or month, or by the piece, the
payment of wages by an employer always
implies the previous rendering of labour. As the
labourer who works for an employer does not get
his wages until he has performed work, his case
is similar to that of the depositor in the bank who
cannot draw money out until he has put money
in. During the time the labourer works for the
employer he is advancing capital to the employer,
but at no time, unless wages are paid before the
work is done, does the employer advance capital to
the labourer. ” —American paper.
Lady Dunlo is understood to aver that she
is quite good enough to be daughter-in law to the
cantankerous Earl of Clancarty, “ who is drinking
himself to death.” She adds that Lady Clancarty
had most to do with bringing the now celebrated
divorce-suit. “ You see she knows her husband
cannot live much longer at the rate he is now
going, and, of course, at his death, I would become
Countess Clancarty, while she would be put upon
the shelf as Dowager Countess. She is a tolerably
young woman yet, and don’t take kindly to that
idea at all, so she is trying to dispossess me of the
title.”
Colonel Price (Vic.), who told his soldiers
to “ fire low ” when they did fire at the strikers, is
a son of John Price (Maurice Frere, of Marcus
Clarke's “His Natural Life”), formerly Superin-
tendent of Convicts at Norfolk Island, and who
was killed at Pentridge by the prisoner Melville.
Blood will tell. Price explains, under pressure,
that while parading the militia from church ort a
Sunday morning he said : “ If you have to fire,
fire low, and lay them out, these disturbers of law
and order,” meaning thereby to hit ’em in the legs
(Irish fashion) and not hurt them overmuch. The
Bulletin cordially compliments Price, junior,
whose lamented father was never half so in-
genious on any recorded occasion. This inter-
pretation of a great mystery has but one modern
parallel—to be found in the history of a recent
Melbourne Stock Exchange scandal“ When I
said ‘ advance,’ I did not mean that the price was
to be advanced, but that we should advance to the
bar and take a drink.” Young man Price evi-
dently has not the nerve of old man Price, whe-
never condescended to explain or apologise t<
anybody.

THEN AND NOW.
Ere Blanky Dash was made a knight,
While still denied the “handle,”
He threw the money left and right—
The game was worth the candle.
But now, with Sir before his name,
His bounty fast decreases—
He’s broken up the former game,
And only keeps the pieces.
Good, Gracious Queen, we moui’n, alas !
The end of title-seeking,
A toady lavish with his brass
Is, in a way of speaking
Ear better than the stingy cur
Whose “ honour” ’s bought and paid for :
Then keep them waiting for the “Sir ”
Their golden traps are laid for.

if the Nellie Stewart v. Marian Burton
breach of agreement case ever comes into Court—
which we think is not at all likely—some interest-
ing glimpses of doings behind the curtain may be
expected. It is well-known that since the opening
night of “Paul Jones,” in Sydney, the Theatre
Royal has not been a hall of harmony—so far
from it, indeed, that sticking-plaster has been
called for at least on one occasion. If the case
does come into Court a big sensation looms ahead
for the evening press.

A well-known S.A. millionaire squatter
recently had a serious difference of opinion with
his only daughter, on account of her attachment
to his private secretary. The father objected to
her choice, but Juliet remained true to Romeo,
and, sooner than submit to the parental decision,
entered a private hospital as nurse. The old man,
however, has now given way, and a marriage will
take place shortly.
* * *
John Higgins, who died at the Royal
Hotel, Sydney, last week (in which house his
brother, Patrick Higgins, M.L.C., the well-known
Zigzag-railway-contractor, expired some years
ago), was a well-known figure in mining circles in
the N.S.W. metropolis, where he was generally
regarded as a rather crusty old bachelor. But it
was not so, for, ever so many years ago, when a very
young man, he married in Melbourne an amiable
girl “and was happy for a year,” as he sadly
said, glancing at the worn wedding-ring, which
was buried with him—“and then she died, and
I’ve been living a lonely life ever since at hotels
and clubs, and such places.” It will be remem-
bered by many that the death of Patrick Higgins
was in no small degree attributable to the loss of
his only son, a promising lad who, while travelling
in a coasting steamer, mysteriously disappeared
and was never again heard of.
* * * *
A sad event was the death at Paddington,
Sydney, last week, of Mrs. Annie Prince, who,
before taking a fatal dose of poison, wrote a
letter to her daughter stating that she was afraid
of becoming mad, and so had decided to prevent
herself being taken among,insane people. The
deceased lady was the widow of Mr. Prince, a
southern merchant, who years ago was a member
of the Melbourne Immigrants’ Home direc-
torate, which comprised the most beautifully
good-hearted and sympathetic set of men we
have ever seen banded together. And no more
need be said in praise of the lady who has just
died under such melancholy circumstances than
that she was possessed of a nature so gentle and
compassionate as to make her a fit wife for one
whose memory and that of his dead associates is
affectionately cherished by the poor.
# * *
Lord Kintore has been drivelling in his
long, bony way, to the effect that the descendant
of a long line of ancestors is necessarily careful to
prevent anything dimming the lustre of his
coronet. Kintore, being the son of a lay preacher
and a little in that line of business himself, is
doubtless ignorant of what goes on in the wicked
world, otherwise he might have called to mind
that England’s premier Earl, viz., Shrewsbury,
eloped with a married woman, that the Marquis
of Ailesbury is the companion of blacklegs, that
the Duke of Marlborough used to kick his wife,
and that the late Lord Aylesford was a notorious
blackguard, and that a hundred other heads of
“families ” nearly as old, or older than, Kintore’s
have been good enough to show reason why all the
coronets in Christendom should be carted off to
the pawnshop for the benefit of the poor, and the
tickets burnt by the common hangman.

While Zola, whom Pastor Bevan sets
down as almost moral, from his excellent inten"
tions, is ruthlessly vetoed by the Victorian
Customs, Theophile Gautier’s audacious Mdlle. de
Maupin, American-English translation, is freely
sold at the Government Railway Bookstalls. Anri
yet it is “frankly and unblushingly immoral.”
Surely, if Nana be an emanation from the sixth
hell, Mdlle. de Maupin is from the seventh. If
we were asked now to pick out a wicked book for
the Auger Society .

Everybody is supposed to know the law,
but a judge doesn’t know it till a barrister tells
him, and the barrister, as a rule, is equally ignorant
till a solicitor enlightens him. If the judge knew
the law, then the barrister would be unnecessary;
and, if the barrister knew it, then the solicitor
would be superfluous. As a rule, however, they
are all three superfluous. The only individual
who is not superfluous is the client.

Margaret Elizabeth, Countess of Jersey,
must be a genius—that is, for a titled person ; for

“a bright star of the Primrose League, but has
failed to incur the enmity of its opponents.” The
Australian Leagues have long languished on the

“the primrose path that leads unto the everlasting

Oneperson at the table besides the Emperor is singu-
iarly honoured, and that is Mr. Gibson Miller, who is an
Australian gentleman devoted to yachting. He is about
to establish a club in the Antipodes, and bou-dit the
Duke of Norfolk’s yacht, now known as Saidde. His name
came up for election at the suggestion of the Prince of
Wales, and he was elected by acclamation—a mark of
exceptional and probably unprecedented favour. Prior
to the election Mr. Miller had left our shores; but on
hearing the glad tidings he immediately posted back to
England, and arrived to-day just in time for the brilliant
gathering of to-night.

They are probably interesting and delicate
“ family reasons ” which induces© many Victorian
members of Parliament to take such a deep interest
in the welfare of the aborigines and their half-
caste offspring at the Framlingham Reserve. The
biography of one Victorian “benefactor ” tells the
story of a man who loved the Australian gin both
wisely and well, and proved an indulgent father
to his half-breed picaninnies, but who, dying,
bequeathed his ample fortune mostly to “ white ”
charities, leaving his semi-coloured heirs to the
official mercy of the State. May the Lord have
official mercy on his soul. Amen.

Mr. Irving Winter-Irving, a Victorian
land-owner, who lately enlarged his surname by
Royal patent, or something, has belched forth
his sentiments concerning the strike. He thinks,
does Irving Winter-Irving, that “ a little starva-
tion would not do unionists much harm.” Down
Bendigo way they seem to have been offering up
groans for I. W. 1., which was both rude and
futile behaviour. Let us rather sing to him :
0, Irving Winter-Irving,
Wouldn’t starving do you good?
You have many servants serving
You with many sorts of food.
If you didn’t eat so often,
Would a gnawing pain inside
Have a tendency to soften
Down your moneybaggy pride ?
0, Irving Winter-Irving,
Letters-patent from the Crown
May have set your lip a curving
With a sense of wide renown :
When your name was Irving Winter
And the hyphen wasn’t thefe,
Were you then, at heart, a stinter
Of the humble toilers’ fare ?
O, Irving Winter-Irving,
Of no union are you
A member staunch, unswerving ?
Are you not a Tory blue ?
You are, you are—you know it:
You belong to the &ite,
And your class (opines the poet)
Gets a sinful lot to eat.
0, Irving Winter-Irving,
Thou pompous pile of pelf !
Every working man’s deserving
Of more victuals than yourself;
Each land-“ lord ” is a fetter
Holding industry in thrall,
And the world would go on better
If starvation killed you all.

While the strike accentuates the bitterness
of Melbourne poverty, the high-toned State school-

Admiration is claimed, in Melbourne, for
one of those familiar mutual-admiration groups of
testimonial photos. It is divided into Esquires,
Misters, and plain men not even Mistered, quite
like orders of nobility, the principle being that
which governed old black Sam Johnson : “ When
I gib £1 to de church, de parson called me Samuel
Johnsing, Esquiah. When I gib 10s., I was Mr.
Johnsing. When I gib 55., I cum down to
Brudder Johnsing, and now I gib only a shillun,

On behalf of Cuddy, the embezzling
manager of a Melbourne Financial Company, a
clergyman stated that he had known prisoner for
ten years, during which time he had been treasurer
of a church, etc. This proves nothing, except
that the parson was too smart to give Cuddy a
chance of sneaking the pew-rents. Perhaps,
though, it was intended as a plea for mercy, on
the ground that the man’s honesty had been neces-
sarily undermined by professional religion.

Roundabout.
Bear Bulletin :—One of the worst aspects
of the strike, and one which you seem to have
entirely overlooked, is that everybody insists on
talking about it. It pervades the streets, and the
churches and the newspapers and the hotels, and
it lifts up its voice in the hash-house—in short it
is everywhere. I am writing this in an upper
room, hut down below the rest of the company
are yelling at each other over the same old topic,
and they will probably continue to yell till far
into the night. The old person with the asthma,
and the deadly wheeze in his windpipe, and the
1141 other symptoms is screaming in a vain effort
to make himself heard above the din ; and the
imported softgoods individual from Belfast, whose
one fixed idea is that the Pope habitually goes
around with dynamite and wants to blow things
up, is clamouring amid a general riot and carnage
of idiots in the attempt to demonstrate that the
strike is in some way owing to the pernicious
influence of Rome. Then there is a red headed
person who balances his food on his knife, and
looks thoughtfully at it, and then shoves the
whole implement down his throat, and he thinks
that the whole disturbance is an underhand device
to bring down the price of varnish because he
trades in that article; and another gentleman,
who is partially red-headed and partially bald,
can be indistinctly heard above the roar and bang
of the debate, imploring the others to keep quiet
till he speaks ; and another indignant item who is
absolutely hairless is exploding with fury because
he has been talking in a corner at the very top of
his voice for two hours, and nobody has even
looked at him. Each one of the five makes a
row like the combined note of the eleven devils
that continually howl round Judas Iscariot, and
they all shriek jointly and simultaneously, and
every one is convinced that he could be heard a

A pair of Sydney detectives went forth one
evening last week to collect evidence against a hair-
dresser who was supposed to have a totalisator
concealed somewhere about his premises. They
disguised themselves before starting, that is to say,
they put on each other’s boots, and brushed their
hair straight up, and assumed that air of fathom-
less mystery which the detective always wears
when he has forgotten his own name and address ;
and then they walked into the suspected house
arm in arm, throwing out their legs at precisely
the same angle, and sat down in two chairs to
wait for evidence. Neither of them offered any
observation; they merely planted themselves and
glared hungrily like two spiders waiting for a fly.
The barber recognised them, and flew round
excitedly and asked them if they would have their
hair cut, but they replied hoarsely that they
didn’t require any assistance. Next moment a
hairless youth slouched in and began to state that
he would invest half-a-sovereign Just here,
however, the barber rushed him backwards into
the chair, and lathered him, and the sentence was
left unfinished. He struggled wildly to escape,
and swore fearfully, and kicked out like a fury,
but the barber whispered fiercely in his ear that if
he said a word about horses he would strangle him
on the spot and bury his remains in-—— but at
this moment a long, knock-kneed larrikin put his
head through the doorway to inquire what odds
he could get about a steeplechase. He didn’t get
far enough to commit himself, however, for with
one jump the other assistant seized him and
began to cut his hair, and told him in a
muffled undertone that if he attempted to say a
word about steeplechases he would never live to
finish the sentence. Then, with a trembling
hand, he dragged out some of his hair by the
roots, cut off a piece of his ear with the scissors,
and threw him out. He went away thoughtfully
and had several drinks, and then, growing partly
oblivious, he came back to renew his question
about the steeplechase, but the instant his head
appeared in the doorway he was partially
strangled and his hair cut a second time. He
retired in a bald condition and greatly surprised ;
and the detectives made an entry to the effect that
no suspicious circumstances had so far come under
their notice. A huge wharf-labourer burst through
the doorway a moment later, and started to
announce that he would invest five bob on
both the assistants hurled themselves on him and
shampooed him at this moment, while he shrieked
for the police and discharged a fiery blast of
language at them, but he was overcome and led
out-in a fearful state of indignation. There was
five minutes’ calm after this, till a stalwart young
woman arrived with a message from her brother,
and she came so near to giving the whole business
away that she was partially shaved in the excite-
ment, and had her hair singed and her fringe
completely demolished, but at last she broke away
and went into hysterics outside. Three
minutes later her father came round to wreck
the whole shop, and one of the assistants
was assaulted before they successfully crushed the
old man into a seat and oiled his head in the midst
of his ravings. It was evident by this time that a
crisis was at hand, for it required the whole avail-
able force on the premises to hold this last
infuriated customer down and put some hair-
restorer on him, and if anyone else came in and
tried to speak it would be impossible to stifle him
without letting the old man out of the chair, and
if once he got out it was certain that he would kill
somebody. But just as the barber and his
employe had resolved to let go, and run for their
lives, and leave all the stock, fixtures, fittings and
utensils behind them, the two officers made an
entry that none but a legitimate trade was evi-
dently conducted on the premises, and then they
rose together and clumped heavily .away. When
they were gone, matters were explained to the
apoplectic father in the chair, and business gra-
dually assumed its normal aspect, except that the
big wharf-labourer has taken out a summons for
shampooing under arms accompanied with vio-
lence, and refuses to be pacified.
* * *
For plain and fancy stupidity the private
detective is supreme, and an Adelaide (S.A.) lady
who lately hired one of them has just realised th’s
fact. Her household consisted of herself and
husband, together with her father who had
arrived from the country on a visit; and she was
a prey to dark suspicions which rendered her life
a misery. There were unaccountable hairs on the
husband’s coat for one thing, and strange patches
of hair-oil sometimes arose on his shirt-front, and
he seemed to forget who she was at times and
called her by a wide variety of names, and then
she would smile upon him while she inwardly
longed to throw the tongs at his villainous head.
And at last her hidden misery becoming too great
for endurance she hired a badly-disguised ex-
policeman who was supposed to be full of deep
sagacity and research, and put him on the trail at
a salary of £4 per week. He was a lumbering,
fatuous, heavy-footed person with a wooden ex-
pression, and had gained his reputation because
he could arrest a bigger larrikin single-handed
than any other man in the city, but he cheerfully
undertook to find out everything under the sun.
And he did it. He traced the offender to bars
and billiard-rooms, and gazed through the window
at him while he hugged a barmaid and asked her
to fly with him, and he hovered behind him as he
threw bouquets to the painted angels of the
ballet. He was trodden on while glaring through
keyholes, and fallen over while listening on stair-
cases, and he nearly got into trouble through
assisting his victim home and searching his
pockets as he went. He reported all these things
regularly, and drew his salary and expenses punc-
tually, and then he would go forth refreshed, and
hide himself under a table somewhere to_ listen to
something, and somebody would kick him under
the impression that he was a dog. He charged
extra for being kicked, and when he was trodden-
on in the execution of his duty the bill used to
mount up alarmingly. It took eleven weeks and
a total outlay of £l2O to finish the investigation,
and when his labours were completed it accidentally
transpired that he had been following his em-
ployer’s father instead of her husband all the time,
and the whole mass of harrowing evidence referred
to the wrong man. Next day an outraged daughter
led the most crestfallen parent in the country to
the railway-station and bade him go home and
stay there for the rest of his life under pain of
exposure and instant vengeance. There are still
mysterious hairs on the husband’s coat, and
patches of hair-oil on his shirt-front.
Lily Bagley, of Melbourne, was tried the
other day for shooting with a liberal and promis-
cuous recklessness at the man who seduced her,
and was duly acquitted. The jury probably
wanted to bring in a verdict of “Served him
right,” but the lamentable barrenness of the
judicial system blocked this expression of opinion.
The man was only slightly injured, but then very
few women ever can shoot straight enough to
bring about a funeral.
Mr. Stanhope, the Tory Secretary of War,
recently offered an entirely new theory in defence
of that fallen ruin with the umbrella, Field-
Marshal Gamp. “A man who had been fifty
years in the service of his country,” he wailed,
“must necessarily have greater authority than
any man, however able or eminent, who succeeds
him.” What an amount of authority George 111.
must have accumulated in his latter days of weep-
ing idiocy, when his sons used to tie him to the
bedpost and jab pins into him by way of light
recreation i
Parkes’s apology to M‘Millan is a painful
evidence that the old man is going downhill. In
the days when he was still strong and vigorous
Parkes never apologised. He offered an explana-
tion now and then, but nothing more, and when
he had finished it he generally went out to the
back and threw away the ear of the person ex-
plained to. If the explanation was long and
intricate lie not unfrequently had his mouth full
of the other party’s whiskers and hair towards the
end of the discussion, and he seldom failed to
make matters clear before he was done. And if
any man came round then to ask Sir ’Enry what
he meant by his offensive language, a voice could
be heard all over the street singing out in a pen-
sive tune such expressions as “withered tarantula!”
“ go out and bark with the dogs!” and the like.
Consequently, when it became known that
M'Millan was in search of information, most of
the older politicians fully expected that he would
come back hamstrung and with all his money
borrowed off him, and some even feared that he
might find it hard to escape with his clothes.
But. alas, the old Parkes wasn’t there, and the
new Parkes actually sorter apologised.
Evidence.
Ask any successful lawyer to what he ascribes
his success, and he will tell you that he has taken
care to have had “ evidence ” to support the cases
he had undertaken. What sends the murderer to
the gallows ? Evidence. What sends the thief to
gaol ? Evidence. What procures a divorce from
a cruel husband ? Evidence. Facts can only be
proved by evidence, and that is how the superiority
of Clements Tonic is proved by the pure and
positive testimony of its various patrons, over all
its imitators, for Clements Tonic has no compeers
or competitors. It is now quite unnecessary for
the manufacturers of Clements Tonic to say a
word in its favor, its reliability, virtues, merits
and therapeutical efficacy are proved beyond all
doubt by the unanimous verdict, |the irrefutable,
incontrovertible, and indisputable evidence of its
influential patrons.
T. B. Bryce, Esq., J.P., writing in the Man-
ning Riveh Times says, “We personally know
some of the sufferers who have taken Clements
Tonic and derived wonderful relief from it.”
W. C. McDougall, Esq., writing in the Bal-
main Observer says, “ The good effects of
Clements Tonic have come under our notice both
by personal experience and by that of two residents
of Balmain.”
Spenser Groves, Esq., writing in the Tumut and
Adelong Times, says, “We have had proof
positive here, in this neighbourhood of the wonder-
ful properties of Clements Tonic.”
W. B. Howarth, Esq., writing in the Grenfell
Record, says, “We have found it of great value
for the hot weather and have had personal experi-
ence, so has a friend of ours in the civil service
who was so sick that he threw up everything but
his appointment, but Clements Tonic cured him.”
S. Beach, Esq., Marrickville, (N.S.W.), says,
“ That Clements Tonic did wonders for Miss
Beach, that four doses only cured both toothache
and earache. *
F. Bagnall, Esq., Ravenhurst, Marrickville,
says, “Mrs. Bagnall took Clements Tonic with
the most gratifying result, and that its use re-
sulted in a restoration of perfect health after two
years of extreme debility. ”
John Plnmmer, Esq., North Willoughby, says,
“ Clements Tonic did Mrs. Plummer a great deal
of good and it is a very good remedy.”
J. W. L. Kyle, Esq., postmaster, Manilla, says,
“ Before I had used one bottle of Clements Tonic
I was quite cured.”
Captain Dibden, Balmain, says, “ That four
bottles completely cured him of debility and
nervousness, and he is glad to bear witness to the
value of such a wonderful remedy. ”
No one ever hears evidence like that, however,
of any of the harmful nostrums sold in so many
shops in place of the genuine Clements Tonic, for
although they copy our advertisements, &c., with-
out stmt, they cannot copy us in our proofs
because such proof is not procurable. A medicine
must have merit before people will lend their
praise and signatures in support of it. Persevere
with the remedy. It must cure, if you only take
enough of it. Remember that in building a house
it has to be done stone by stone, brick by brick,
slate by slate and so it is with disease, you can
only cure by persistent treatment, you can’t blow
weakness out of the system by dynamite, you
must restore lost energy by natural and continued
treatment. Insist on Clements, it is sold every-
where.

grow long and glossy. These beautiful brushes
are made with pure bristles —not wires, which
injure the scalp and cause baldness and irritation.

The Australian Club make a mistake in putting
ihamois-leather gloves on the light spatters. Half the
battle from an onlooker’s point of view, in a show set-to
lies in’the clean hitting and loud-sounding slaps from the
kid gloves.
# * *
Notwithstanding the antagonism of the big
Jockey Clubs, pony-raoing flourishes apace about Sydney.
The biggest meeting yet held is now in course at Moore-
geld when, amongst other big money, there are two
races of £l5O each. Captain “ Tom ” Merry took back to
America a glowing account of our pony-racing, and one
of the principal ’Frisco papers has taken the matter up,
advocating the formation of pony and galloway clubs,
observing that they will take a great anxiety from the
shoulders of big breeders who have hitherto not had any
market for their undersized stock.
* * *
Occasionally the horse-training reporter graces
his copy with a new flower of speech culled from the
squalid back-yard of his blighted brain. He gets tired of
saying that something strode along freely, or did long,
strong work, or indulged in healthy exercise, &c. A '
Flemington tout announces that “ Lady Agnes was noted
mmtina smartly,” which is intended to explain that the
mare had a fast canter around the ordinary track. It
doesn’t mean that Lady Agnes was waltzing.

One bookmaker had £lBOO staked on the South
Melbourne and Carlton football-match !
# # *
The Fitzroy (Vic.) footballers have got an ex-
pensive opinion from a barrister about a certain goal
which they claim to have kicked in a late match with
Port Melbourne. They are going to get another powerful
opinion from another barrister, and if it is also favourable,
they intend to go into the Supreme Court and recover
that goal and costs, if it takes all the money they have to
tio it. The spectacle of six judges wrestling with a ques-
tion about a goal, not a gaol, is a grim commentary on
the degraded stupidity of Australia.
* * *
The Australian Eleven have not done so badly
in their tour as would appear to an outsider. There is no
doubt they have played with very hard luck, as most of
the drawn matches were much in their favour. No
previous Australian Eleven has had to meet such strong
elevens, and the estimation in which the Britishers held
them may be gleaned from the fact that Peel, Lehmann,
Briggs and Attewell chased them ail over the United
Kingdom. And—no doubt a delicate subject to touch
upon—it is quite surprising the number of Australian
wickets lost by the umpires’ decisions of “leg before.”
* * *
Gresford has been purchased by Mr. “Bravo”
Jones for £lOOO, and is a cheap colt at the money. He is

“ The smaller the men the quicker the fighting,”
and Willis and Holden, at the Sydney Amateur Gymnastic
Club, on the 24th inst., were no exception to the rule.
T,he contest was for the “bantam” championship, and
blood and hair fairly flew till the middle of the second
round, when Holden was counted out. It is on the cards
that Willis will go to America.
# * *
Slavin’s defeat of M'Auliffe came rather as a
pleasurable surprise, for previous to Slavin’s departure
from Australia, he had, though a most promising man,
never shown form entitling him to be considered a tip-
topper. He defeated Farnan, Peter Jackson's conqueror,
but Tom Lees also beat Farnan twice, and when Jackson
went under he was a stripling, and lucky when he got a
square meal. Slavin also defeated the Yankee, Costello,
and put Mick Dooley through his facings twice, but it
must be confessed that at one portion of Dooley’s first
fight it was a toss up who won. Taking a line from that
most uncertain guide, the time occupied in defeating a
man, Slavin should be on velvet in meeting Jackson, as it
took Peter 24 rounds to do what Slavin got through in
less than two. Slavin may not get on a match with
Sullivan easily, as he appears to be more of the showman
than the boxer now. Slavin is undoubtedly a bom
fighter, and game as vou make them. He was obviously
designed by Nature to take punishment and to alter the
shape of men’s countenances. One of the most awe-
inspiring of sights is to see Mr. Slavin, with his hair
cropped short and some blood on his forehead, glare and
rush at the fellow who has just twice punched him
hard in the mouth.

Rowley Pickering, sporting editor of Sydney
Mail, said the other day that he and Elias Laycook had
shot 666 gill-birds in one day. He was informed that 666
was the number of the Beast, and that he (It. P.) was
therefore Antichrist or something. Scripture will prove
anything.

Positively the unluckiest racing-man in Aus-
tralia is Sir W. J. Clarke, Bart. However, it is well that
those who have all the money don’t enjoy all the luck.
His Claret, a horse, won the Caulfield Steeplechase the
other day. Turfites oast up their logs for another win by
the Bart, from time immemorial, or since his antediluvian
mare Petrea. He must have given the bookmakers a
whole station.

Charley Dunn, who was defeated by Fogarty in

There was a big row at the Sydney Driving Park
meeting on Saturday, when Fairy Boy started for the sell
ing race at 6 to 4 on, and lazily ran into third place. Th(
public yelled for gore and were not mollified until his
owner was “sent up ” for life, and the jockey for twelve
months. Ponies are good property just now, and Fairy
Boy was claimed by Dr. Slate for £lOO.

English cricketer Shrewsbury does not think it
would pay to tour the colonies in ’92. The writer differs
from Shrewsbury. If a team were brought out whose
motto was “ put on the runs as fast as you can for fear it
should come on to rain,” then the trip would be no failure.

The Irish amateur cyclist, M'Credy, has won
the 50-miles safety bicycle championship in record time of
2hr. 29min. 55 l-ssec., or at the rate of 20 miles an hour
throughout. Much of the late success in record-breaking
seems to be due to the use of pneumatic tyres, whose
benefits in racing some of the Sydney know-alls pooh-
poohed so liberally a short time ago.
THE VERY BEST
A single pain is often the first indication, and
the last throe, in one, of a physical climax, and
the climax is death. That St. Jacobs oil has
again and again wrought its miracles just in the
nick of time, has bridged over the critical emerg-
ency, and has
SAVED MANY LIVES
at the point of death, is fully attested by the
record of many extraordinary cures in which this
fact of saving life is duly set forth.
If to its remarkable virtues in the permanent
cure of chronic cases of Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
Lumbago, Sciatica, after years of endurance,
wherein everything else proved valueless, fortunes
were spent in vain, and crutches and crippled
limbs were the manifestations, is to bo added its
supreme sovereignty over pain, even unto death,
i it is whollv entitled to the appellation of
THE VERY BEST.
Its specific action is especially adapted with a
| curative penetration and soothing effect, to arrest
any pain at the acme of its worst influence. St.
: Jacobs oil applied externally is now known as the
! best specific to arrest the fatal tendency of any
! aggravated pain.
j A MOST REMARKABLE CASE
j can be cited in proof, which is thoroughly verified,
j It is in its main features taken from a leading
1 Liverpool journal as follows: “Two years ago,^
| states Mr. William Buchanan, residing at No. 8,
! St. John’s-road, Kirkdale, Liverpool, and twenty-
I four years in the service of the Cunard Steamship
1 Company, “I was taken down with a most
| excruciating pain in my head, winch was followed
’ by
ONE YEAR OF TORTURE.
All physicians believed that it would lead to
softening of the brain and death. Six of the
most eminent attended me ; but gave no relief. X
had to be held down, and my screams were heard
outside. My case was deemed incurable. My
wife procured a bottle of St. Jacobs oil, and
applied it to my head. It acted like magic. I
was cured by it, and am now in perfect health,
and I have not had the slightest return since I
was cured some months ago. ” Nothing more need
be added.
A NUGGET OF WISDOM.
GEORGE ELIOT'S OPINION OF SWISS
WATCHES.
“These little Geneva toys are cleverly con-
structed to go always a little wrong. But if you
wind them up and set them regularly every night
you may know at least that it’s not noon when tbs
hands point there.’’ — FROM “Felix Holt the
Radical,” Chap. XXII.
NOTE. —We are indebted to our East Indian
correspondent (M. A. J. Faulding), for this quo-
tation from a popular novelist, whose works are
often referred to as containing “Nuggets of
wisdom,” and whose opinion regarding cheap
Swiss watches was delivered long years before the
Waterbury watches were ever dreamed of. The
difference between a “Geneva toy” and a reliable
and accurate Waterbury has been amply demon-
strated. The Waterbury is a timekeeping watch
in the best sense of the word. — Exchange.
CAUTION.
If you want correct time and a watch which, in
event of accident, can be cheaply and efficiently
repaired, AVOID the cheap, trashy. Swiss burglar
baits sold to the unwary as timekeepers. Consult
public opinion in the matter —not the interests of
some pettifogging dealer, who only too eagerly
foists upon you a useless, rubbishy, and worthless
article, for the sake of gaining extra profit, and
who cares little for your execrations which will
> surely be showered on his head in the near future,
xx you consult public opinion you will beyond a
shadow of a doubt BUY A WATERBURY,
the testimony in favour of which as a reliable and
accurate timekeeper is overwhelming; and which,
moreover, in event of injury, can be efficient-
ly repaired at low cost by taking or sending
it to any of the company’s repair agencies,
established in various centres of the colonies.
All Watches Manufactured by the Waterbury
Watch Co. have the word “ WATERBURY"
PRINTED in fine type upon their dial faces,
AND ALSO THE INTERWOVEN LETTERS W.W.Co.,
WITHOUT WHICH NO WATCH SOLD AS A WATER-
BURY IS GENUINE.

THE BULLETIN (Published at Sydney, N.S.W)
The Unique Weekly, Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
The Bulletin, the Premier Australian Literary
Journal, is the only paper which has a con-
sistent and distinctive Australian National
Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Man, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics,
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the other half that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started seven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sessed a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
Influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
firs? issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
'.ocal and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have, during the
last year, spent some thousands of pounds in
fitting their buildings with the latest appliances
for high-class printing and the production of illus-
trations, and they have now issued The Bulletin
in an entirely new form-printed with new type
of improved legibility on the finest paper, and
adorned with sketches from the hands of the
ablest and best-paid newspaper artists Australia
has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudai
Expedition from its inception.
The voice of The Bulletin is the beacon-fire
of national progress : it is the forceful summons to
the crusade against the monopolies in land,
wealth, power, and privilege—the direct cause of
half the misery which now afflicts British
humanity. Against the claims of avaricious
clergy who claim to monopolise salvation, against
the dark despotism of grasping plutocrats, and
against the exercise of any human authority
which has not been granted by the people over
whom it is exercised, The Bulletin will fearlessly
and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the
most popular city publication and the organ of the
ntelligeut bushman must indeed be broadly based.
The circulation of The Bulletin in Sydney is
unrivalled by that of any other weekly journal,
and more them a hundred copies of it are sold in
Melbourne to one of any other paper printed out-
side that city. Perhaps the strongest proof of The
Bulletin’s popularity is found in the unchallenge-
able fact —easily ascertainable from any postal
official —that, of all journals issued in Australasia,
The Bulletin is the one most frequently re-
mailed from one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
ether paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and beat, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

Belinda’s Smile.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Of all the girls I ever knew,
Belinda Banks was boss;
A pious, wintry chill she threw
On all she came across.
Her friends would rather run a mile
Than stop to face Belinda’s smile.
Belinda was not tough or old,
Or terrible of mien;
She wasn’t what is call’d a scold.
But patient and serene ;
Yet, really, it was doosid droll
To see them tremble when she srao'k.
So cokl her beam, so cold and pure,
So different to most;
A gushing spinster’s grin, I’m sure,
Is often “ warm as toast ”
Which saying none could reconcile
With dear Belinda’s solemn smile.
She’d walk into a drawing-room
’Midst sounds of joy and glee,
When suddenly an awful gloom
Would fall on all but me;
This daughter of the Sunny South
Wore such a smile about her mouth.
’Twas full of gentle, meek reproof
Commingled with surprise—
It seemed to say, “I hold aloof
From earthly vanities,
And look on merriment as vile. ”
Thus dumbly spake Belinda’s smile.
I was a true Kerristian then
And taught in Sunday-school,
Nor cared for giddy, bad young men
Who drink and play the fool;
I used to offer Heaven thanks
For having made Belinda Banks.
She seemed the very sort of wife
A teacher ought to choose
To sanctify his path in life
And keep him off the booze.
I was a “mug,” I must allow—
But, bless your heart! I’m wiser now.
So in the chilly month of May
I claimed her for my own,
And marvelled, in the good old way.
How man can live alone
When such an angel from above
Would comfort him and be his love.
Three months, or so, had flitted by.
Three months of holy bliss,
Before Belinda wondered why
I talked like that or this ;
And, somehow, in a little while
A change came o’er Belinda’s smile.
It grew like those of other girls,
Those skittish “ bits of jam ” :
She learned to blush and shake her curls,
And once she muttered “ dam “;
So far, indeed, she even got
As mentioning a place that’s hot.
I was a true Kerristian still.
It grieved me to remark
How oft she went with cousin Bill
For rambles after dark,
And was so very apt to be
Alone with him, instead of me.
His manner wasn’t grave and kind.
Check-trousers, too, he wore—
But yet Belinda’s heart inclined
To William more and more ;
Till one day, when I came from church,
I found she’d left me in the lurch.
Her conduct cut me like a knife,
It cut me to the heart.
And though Belinda’s still my wife
Of course w r e live apart.
A change, too, has come over me—
I’m quite a rorty cup of tea.
The faithless one (I’ve understood
From men who know her well)
Looks better now she’s not so good ;
Her ballet name is “ Belle ”
She’s on the stage, and mashes earls.
And smiles like all the other girls.
1 had a moral ip my mind
When sitting down to this,
But now ’tis finished off I find
The moral’s gone amiss—
In point of fact there wasn’t time
For putting reason in the rhyme.


At the Old Bailey (London) one day last
month a young man attired in a slouch hat with a
battered brim appeared on a charge of attempted
murder and unfinished suicide. It transpired in
evidence that he earned £1 a week and allowed
his mother 10s. of that amount. He lived himself
on the other 10s., and having bestowed his affec-
tions on a girl of 17 they looked forward to the
time when they would be united, and feed on dry
bread in an attic for the rest of their lives. The
young lady hadn’t a cent., and was unable to get
work, so he shared the 10s. with her. Also he
took her aged father and her sister and her
crippled brother out of the workhouse, and the
whole five existed on a precarious income which
allowed them two shillings apiece weekly. By
and bye, however, the prisoner’s brain deterio-
rated, probably because he and the four paupers
lived riotously on the half-sovereign and gave way
to gluttony and overfeeding; anyhow one night
the distracted lover began to see visions and
things in his attic, and he went out and cut his
girl’s throat and his own, and then threw himself
downstairs. They both recovered, and Judge
Grantham, after hearing the evidence, heaved a
sigh that blew the criminal’s hat right out into
the street. Then he admonished him in a pensive
tone upon the sinfulness of his ways, and hinted that
he was fast going to perdition. Also, he discharged
him, and told him not to do it again, and took up
a subscription of ten guineas, and having handed
over the coin he bade the recipient clear out and
get married on the proceeds—which was hideously
bad advice.

A Lesson from the Strike.
Editor Bulletin, —Sir, were anything needed to
emphasise a lesson which has been inculcated by
every strike that has taken place by labour-unions
since their inception, it is being abundantly fur-
nished at the present crisis. The lesson to which
I refer, and which requires so much iteration and
reiteration to properly impress itself, is this—the
greatest enemy to the working man is the working
man himself. .
The unionist war is really not so much against
capital as against non-union labour; for if the
latter were not procurable the employer and employe
would be brought face to face on fair terms ; and
it is safe to assume that strikes would be very few,
and very short-lived when they occurred, if capital
were deprived of that whip to use against labour
which is supplied by the class of toilers who
selfishly keep aloof from their fellow-workers, and
who are known as “non-unionists.” It is quite
clear that if the world’s workers are ever to be
elevated to a higher plane of social comfort than
they have hitherto enjoyed, it can only be achieved
by mutual and, as near as possible, universal
combination.
What would be the effect of such a combination?
Every man having labour of any description to
sell would be placed in a position to treat with a
purchaser, but the minimum wage the worker
would have to receive, as well as the maximum
number of hours he would have to toil, would be
fixed beyond mistake. The existence of such a
state of things would, I firmly believe, not only
immensely increase the comfort and happiness of
every human being on earth who receives pay for
services rendered, but would also add to the hap-
piness and in no way diminish the comfort and
luxuries enjoyed by those who pay for labour.
What would it matter to a railway or other con-
tractor had he to pay higher wages to those who
did his work so long as the price he received was
proportionately high? What would it matter to
the owner of a great coal-mine if the men who
delved for him were made better off, so long as he
could command a higher price for the commodity
his purchased labour produced ? What would it
matter to the farmer if he were bound to pay his
helps and servants a higher wage and give them
shorter hours, so long as he received for
the product of their labour a higher price !
to compensate him for his extra expendi-
ture ? And so on with every conceivable
branch of employment and labour. The effect
would be not only an increase in the comfort
and contentment of the masses all the world over,
but it would ensure a sense of security as well to
the few who are called capitalists. Avenues of
employment would be open in all directions,
which are now kept closed because of mutual dis-
trust. Petty tyrannies which are now occasionally
practised owing to the employment of non-union
labour would cease to exist, because the necessity
for them had ceased to exist. There is not the
least doubt that by far the greatest cause of
trouble between unionists and capitalists is non-
union labour, nor can it be denied that so long as
the latter class of labour is at the command of
capital, so long will the efficiency of unionism be
comparatively feeble and of small effect.
This being so, it behoves those who have the
noble end in view—the universal combination of
labour—to use every effort to induce all men who !
depend upon their labour to unite for purposes of
mutual elevation and self-protection. An argu-
ment against unionism that one continually hears
uttered in certain quarters is—Why should not a
man who is willing to work be allowed to work,
how and when he chooses ?
The reason that he should not be so allowed is
that no man has a right to do any deed or
commit any act calculated to injuriously
affect his fellow-men; and by endeavouring
to nullify the act of hundreds of union men
who have seen fit to strike as a means of
rectifying what they conceive to be a wrong, the
non-unionist strikes a heavy and forceful blow at
the emancipation of every human creature who
depends upon toil for existence.
If the capitalist could only be made to see that
universal unionism (which must, by the way, come
sooner or later) would not only not injure, but
really improve his position, and if the non unionist
could only be made to see the same, one of the
greatest problems the human race has to solve
would, I believe, have found a practical solution.
In conclusion, I cannot do better than repeat
that the greatest enemy to the working man is
the working man himself.
Yours, &o., W. G.
[Even should all the world’s workers become unionists,
the labour problem would not be solved by any means.
The monopolist would not then have the power to keep
down wages by playing the unemployed against the em-
ployed, but then, as now, it would be necessary to his
existence that he should limit production and therefore
limit the number of producers. With the monoply of
land, the source of wealth, and capital, the tool for its
production, still at his back, this limitation could easily be
maintained. Consequently, under universal unionism,
individual pay might be higher, but as the unionist in
work would be compelled to support the unionist out of
work, the aggregate earnings of labour would probably
not be increased and the advantage would be one of
little value. Nor, while production is for profit and not
tor use, can things be altered for the better.— Ed. B.)

A shepherd brought a nugget, weighing 4 oz., to
Melbourne in 1849. It was shown to Superin-
tendent Latrobe, and a reward claimed, but
Latrobe would do nothing. The nugget was on
view for months in the window of the Waterman’s
Arms Hotel.
A Melbourne husband, cross-examining
the missus in Richmond police-court, asked her
whether she didn’t express a desire to see him run
over by a railway-engine. A flush of indignation
suffused the lady’s face. She had never men-
tioned an engine in connection with her partner
for life. Between sobs she admitted to having
casually remarked that dear Janies would be much
better at the bottom of the Yarra, and it was a
pity a horse didn’t kick his brains out.
“ Max O’Rell” asks : “Why are the bulk
of French marriages far happier than the bulk of
English ones ? In my opinion it is simply because,
according to the French system, a man has to win
the affection of his wife after the wedding. The
French married couple begin at the first act,
whereas the English one has generally got through
all but the fifth by the time the wedding-bells
have stopped ringing. Then in come the prosaic
cares of life and cover everything up. Out go the
lights, and, presto ! the glamour is gone, too, and
nothing remains of it all but a sleepy numbness
and a sort of wonder that the comedy should enjoy
such a world-wide reputation. Yes, in matrimony
there is a way of eating your cake and yet having
it; but you must not take your bites too large in
the beginning. As a clever wit says, ‘ When you
are dead, it is for a long time; but when you are
married, it is for ever.’”

Louise the forlorn, recently arrived late at a
concert given in her honour at the house of Mrs.
Mackay (the silver queen who never took in wash-
ing), just four hours behind time, in fact, as the
string quartette was putting the pianissimo touch
on someone’s “Op 50.” The Princess wasn’t a
bit disconcerted, she just got them to go through
the programme all over again (she is so fond of
music), and when they finished at 4 a.m., she was
the only one in the crowd who didn’t look sleepy
and wasn’t at heart in a vile temper.
Kicking is the latest and healthiest exercise
for ladies. It reduces any tendency to corpulence,
makes the limbs round and graceful, and adds
wonderfully to the vigour and elasticity of the
entire frame. Every lady should kick hard for an
hour before going to bed and for half an hour
immediately after rising in the morning. When
preparing for a ball it is advisable to kick with
desperate ferocity for about ten minutes in order
to get the muscles in good condition. Care re-
quires to be taken in the early stages of this
exercise, else the amateur may knock the furniture
into splinters, and drive the bedstead and wash-
stand through the window; but after a time she
grows active and expert, and then she can fly up
and hit a mosquito on the mantelpiece with both
feet, and return lightly to the floor without doing
the slightest damage to her surroundings.
A Yankee paper publishes the following
libellous and outrageous statement on the lack of
beauty in British Royalty and aristocracy :
What a fiction it is to talk about the beauty of any
member of the English Royal family. There could not be
a more commonplace lot of women. The Princess of
Wales is slender almost to emaciation ; her eyes would be
dull but for the make-up which surrounds them ; her
cheeks are rouged and a wig always covers her head,
which, lam given to understand, is completely bald. She
has little if any bust, she limps as she walks, and she is
almost stone deaf ; so, one way and another, it is rather
sickening to read the mass of gush that is to be read daily
in the British newspapers about the beauty, &c., of Eng-
land’s future Queen. She is, no doubt, an accomplished,
amiable, virtuous woman, but in appearance she is an
absolutely commonplace and altogether uninteresting
person. All three of the Princesses of Wales have in-
different teeth, bad complexions, and wretched figures.
Nobody would look at them twice but for their
exalted position. The daughters of Princess Christian
are equally plain looking, and there is no pro-
mise of beauty in the young daughters of the
Duchess of Edinburgh. As for Princess May of Teck,
who has so often been described as a beauty, all she can
claim to possess is a passable figure and good eyes. Her
face, however, is spoiled by the way in which her upper
lip protrudes and by a nose which suggests an Hebraic
strain somewhere or other in her family. Of the many
vaunted beauties of London society only the Duchess of
Leinster would, perhaps, pass as a lovely woman all over
the earth. Lady Londonderry also comes under that
head, and so does Miss Wolseley, the young daughter of
Lord Wolseley, who made her debut this year. Lady
Dudley is now completely passes, and is as much made
up as an opera bouffe prima donna. All the Duchesses
are plain-looking women; even the two American
Duchesses, Marlborough and Winchester, are too far
beyond their youth to claim affiliation with Venus. The
Duchess of Portland looks like a well-fed dairymaid, and
the Duchess of Newcastle bears a marked resemblance to
a younger edition of Mrs. Cleveland. The Dowager
Duchess of Montrose is a sight for the gods, with her
flaxen wig and her canary-coloured garments, not to men-
tion her enormous proportions. She reminds one of the
better-half of a suddenly-enriched German brewer from
Chicago. She certainly would not be permitted to enter
a fashionable New York hotel until her rank had been
explained. The Duchesses of Rutland, Leeds, Cleveland
and Richmond are all old women, while the Duchesses of
Abercorn, Hamilton, Argyll and Westminster are abso-
lutely plain and undistinguished

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, October 1,1890.
Mt Dear Moorabinda. —
It is becoming noticeable at high-class concerts that
the ordinary encore—which is really an act of unmeaning
politeness on the part of an enduring audience—is not
accounted an encore, and that only artists desperately
eager to screech come on grasping a roll of music as they
wriggle their acknowledgments. “Once a recall—twice
an encore,” is the rule at present, and the genius who
comes back first time and springs another ditty on a
courteous crowd who really didn’t mean to ask for more,
is apt to pipe to a silent house during the rest of the pro-
gramme.
An irascible and verdant person “ writes to the papers ”
complaining of the habit “ girls and women” in Sydney
have of “ gaping into shop-windows to discover the
catchpenny when they could step inside and purchase
and not obstruct the thoroughfare.” But this vexed
individual doesn’t remember that shop-windows reflect as
well as display. It’s not the catchpenny nor even their
own “ full length ” these absorbed gown-gazers are after —
they are simply keeping an eye on the foot-passengers,
and when the favoured one approaches she turns so
innocently, “ Ah ! how do you do, Mr. FitzJonesf It’s
ever so much better than playing spider on the door-mat.
On dlt that a suburban medico, in conjunction with a
compounder of whatever goes to make up a threepenny
ice, has arranged to have these flabby refreshers passed
round the Sydney theatres in place of the bilious choco-
late-cream which now does the rounds of the circle. Ice-
creams ever tempt the young and thoughtless in the
summer season, and the innovation will probably catch
<w until somebody dies of peritonitis on the premises, or
until it significantly leaks out that the other member of
the firm is an undertaker.
The abandoned idea of a farewell ball to Lady Caring-
ton, who will accept neither bauble nor hall from her
hivin’ subjects generally, savoured very much of “one
for you and two for myself,” unless it was designed to
keep the dance impossibly private, For at all such affairs
Lady Carington dances two formal squares and perohe s
on the dais for the rest of the evening, while people
promenade slowly by, blinking furtively or openly glaring
at her, and representative ladies flounder uninvited into
her presence, while weird people, whom she cannot re*
member, bow impressively from all quarters until mid-
night, when she withdraws quietly and her part in the
festivity is over.
The greatest aggravation one has to endure at the
dressmaker’s is to occupy the same box with the bride-
eiect who has come to try on the wedding-gown—with
one sleeve out or the darts unsewn, to counteract the
supposed baleful influences which attend the fitting-on
of the completed robe of sacrifice. “ I shall be so nervous,”
she explains to the “buttoner” who inevitably accom-
panies her, “ but Harry won’t be.” “Do you think Harry
likes the bridesmaids' hats f” “ Oh, this train is really an
inch too much—Harry hates them long,” etc. This
deceives everybody who doesn’t know men wen enough
to be cynically sure that if Harry had been really studied
in the matter, she would have slipped into a registrar’s
in her quietest walking-gown, and tied the knot before an
official in shirt-sleeves.
There is division in Sydney war-circles—over a millinery
question of course. The absorbing question is whether
the Volunteers shall have gold lace on their uniforms,
and the officers to a unit are understood to say that
should their men be auriferously trimmed, the staff wil)
east aside their principal attraction and go forth on their
merits. With gold laoe frilled round his coat-tails, the
amateur Tommy Atkins would look like the result cf
drawing the wrong ticket in a raffle ; while to strip the
lace off the “ staff ” would be like robbing a soap-adver-
tisement of an eighteen-carat frame.
An enormous crowd of people, headed by Mayor and
Mrs. Burdekin, filled the yawning Centennial Hail, on
24th ult., to hear Sydney Liedertafel struggle through
“ Antigone,” set to Mendelssohn’s musie, with the aid of
a string orchestra and a confident “reader” of the
abridged dramatic portion, and though the effort of sing-
ing the difficult chant-like music with the words lopped
off in the most impossible places and slipping over into
bars where they have no business to be must be some-
thing like riding downstairs in a dray, still a knowledge
of the sufferings of the band of larks in white shirt-fronts
and kid gloves didn’t make one enjoy the classical out-
burst any the more. It was like going to church. The
reader would make an audible statement in an inoffensive
way, and the whole chorus would come down on him with
a bellow and criticise his mournful remarks from D below'
to upper A until he must have been sorry he spoke. The
second part of the programme introduced Mrs. Vander-
veer Greene in white,silk and crystal beads singing “ My
heart at thy sweet voice,” followed by Miss Baber in pale
primrose and tan gloves with “ Orpheus and his lute ”
giving Cowen’s “A World Between” as encore with a
magnificent disregard for words and tempo which almost
suggested that, the lady composed as she went along.
Kowalski—the other interpolated genius who lent variety
to the card—was encored for a “Grand Polonaise”
(Chopin), and scintillated through some fireworks on
“ The Last Rose of Summer ” to the joy of the back row,
who had no occasion to hold their ears. Mrs. Burdekin
wore black lacc designed in a floral stripe veiled over ecru
satih, elbow' sleeves of fulled gauze and tiny Medici collar
in black jet, a cluster of saffron roses on the bodice, and
the bouquet presented at the Manly Flower Show in white
actlnotus, epacris, ferns, &c. (gt
Sydney “Royal” Naval Home (an aquarium-like, wet-
plaster-colored, four-storied edifice), situated in Charlotte-
place was opened with much state on 25th inst. by Lord
Carington (accompanied by Lady Carington), in the
presence ot all the leading naval officers, headed by
Admiral Lord Charles Scott (who can’t even read a speech
without those breathless pauses and gaspings which one
only forgives in the orator relying solely on his wrist-
bands) and Admiral Valois, of the German warship now
in port, also a crowd of the public, who filled the dining-
room—the scene of the ceremony—to overflowing. The
house was a bower of westeria, roses, azaleas and camelias.
Lady Carington wore shot-pink silk and fawn velvet, and
moss roses in her bonnet; Lady Scott was in moss-green
woollen, relieved with black braid and moire. The cere,
monies were as usual. The Baron, who takes on another
tinge of saffron after each banquet, made a “ funny ”
speech, and scratched the back of every “ representative ”
person within a mile of the building, after which almost
everybody got a round of hoorays, including the kindly
Mr. Shearston, who has been appointed head of the house.
The other orators were Captain Dean and Admiral Scott.
The Naval Home is really a seaman’s residential
elub, and if only the management will curb its
evident desire for unlimited Moody and Sankey anti bo
economical in the length of its morning prayers, it ought
to be most popular with those who go down to the sea in
ships. The building (which cost £14,000) will accommodate
350 beds, and has smoking, reading, bath rooms, &c., and
several ladies intend holding concerts, amateur theatri-
cals and so on from time to time in its maritime shades.
Lord Carington made the Home a very handsome gift—a
large oil-painting of the “Battle of St. Vincent.”
The added attraction of two vocal numbers by a French
baritone of repute drew a big throng to the Hazou orches-
tral concert on 27th ult., when Lady Carington—in shot-
fawn and pink silk with fawn velvet sleeves, bonnet in
gold iaoe and blush roses, accompanied by Miss Walenn
in dark-blue tartan and feathered hat, and brother Rupert
in the sulks—accorded her patronage, for probably the
very last time, to the harmonious proceedings. Monsieur
Deslouis—the attraction—is a puffy, middle-aged baritone
with a larky eye and a winning little strut in his walk,
reminiscent of Handsome George in his kingliest
moments. He sang “ Les Rameaux” with orchestral
accompaniment, and modestly hung back until the encore
became clamorous, and later on Kowalski’s “ Gillies de
Bretagne ” (a woman behind me freely translated this as
“ AVaistooats of Britain !”), which allowed him to emit a
limit head-note with the piercing howl that always makes
a Sydney audience feel that it’s ten shillings haven’t fled
in vain, as the singer is a-burstin’ o’himself—of course
that was re-demanded. A double encore resulted, and it
was interesting to note how the kid No. 6's banged
together like cymbals. As a rule, female enthusiasm,
except for a Beliew, is limited to a few silly, noiseless pats
on the back of one hand, strikingly suggestive of a half-
hearted ’skeeter chase.
It is perfectly true that a stylish and comparatively
recent widow, engaged to gay December with an appal-
ing bank-account, takes the hoary bridegroom-expectant
with her to the frockist’s, where he is accommodated with
a front seat during the mystic rites of “ fitting-on.”
Madame Mantalini thinks it's “ papa,” of course, and the
billiard-ball-topped Romeo never contradicts a lady.
The all-pervading fashion of the beauty-spot veil gives
rise to the query, “AVhy do women always locate the
dot over the very worst feature in their face?" The
motive of the beauty-spot is, I presume, to draw atten-
tion to what you consider the speciality of your frontis-
piece. If you have a pretty mouth the spot is placed on
the corner ; nice eyes, on the cheekbone, and so on, but
few women seem to grasp this simple fact! I met a girl
recently with goose-eyes, and (I should think) most kissable
mouth—yet that guide-post spot was dangling over her
left eyebrow. Another fascinator had placed two spots
on either ear, as if her beauty lay there, which it didn’t,
while another had arranged the velvet semi-circle on the
confines of a mouth which turned down at the corners.
N-B. —Never marry a woman whose mouth turns down at
the corners.
The first re appearance of the gifted Best at the Cen-
tennial Hall, on the 37th ult., proved to a full house that
the talented gentleman still wears white weskits, and that
the largest organ in the world still sounds as if a number
of empty jam-tins had got mixed up loose inside when
the music is “maestoso,” while softer movements are so
tangled up with wind that they sound like a cow trying
to “moo” with a head cold. The Best recital served to
introduce the latest convert from comic-operaism, Marian
Burton, who has repudiated fleshings for the deml-train
of the conoert-platform, and who seemed all the time to
be repressing a fatal tendency to alternate each hand over
her heart while the other was curving gracefully in mid
air as was her wont as “Boooacoio” and other bifurcated
heroes. She wore an appealing costume in pale-pink silk
draped with crystal net, diamond ornaments and tan
gloves, and chose for her initial effort Hullah’s “ Three
Fishers,” a doleful ditty, with a leak in its raison d’etre,
since now-a-days the average woman has to weep and
work while the oki man goes on strike. There was no
dressing in front, and the women were mostly topped
with floral toques and carried reticules in their warm
right hands, while a blonde young man was the
“sinecure” of all eyes with a large black “beauty”
spot on his typical cheek.
It was played low down on Gov. Carington when ha
was invited to open the Sydney yachting season on 27th
inst. with the last banquet lying ominously high up and
a stiff nor’-easter blowing, Bill. Many a “ soft ” seaman,
of whom only two or three bias flannel seams were visible
over the stern, was understood to remark in a suffocating
way that he believed he could see coral growing at a great
depth. The day was glorious, with the sky blue as a
writ.
The second vice-regal ball on 25th ult. might have been
the first for all the difference there was. The two hops
were as alike as two peas, and most of the dresses had
been seen before, as is generally the case late in the
season. Westeria was the main idea in the decorations,
and if perhaps the perfume is very headachy in a close
room, still it looks handsome hanging from a nail; but
the knobby and obviously Republican waratah seemed
decorative matter out of place in the atmosphere of
Government House. Lady Carington received her guests
at the entrance to the red drawing-room and wore a pale
heliotrope silk with a soft front of chiffon and falling
sprays of westeria (about the most difficult flow er to make
a convincing artificial after, by the way), diamond orna-
ments, and bouquet of actonotus —her favourite Aus-
tralian flower—and opened the hall with Lord Charles
Scott, Lord Carington dancing with Lady Charles Scott,
dressed in white satin and chiffon well draped. There
was a good deal of colour on the floor and very few black
toilettes to detract from the sweetness and light of the
gathering, which was thoroughly enjoyed—especially by
the givers of the feast, who couldn’t help joyfully reflect-
ing, I know, that this was their very last social outbreak.
“ The New Magdalen ” is a bad title for the dry-sob
spectacle inaugurated at Her Majesty’s Theatre on 27th
ult. The play ought now to be called “ The Old
Magdalen,” for we have got so tired of her ! Life is too
short for play-actors to spontaneously ascend the stump
and give intoned disquisitions on subjects that were dead
fifty years ago; and then if one is cynically inclined, one
feels so keenly that Mercy Merrick would never have made
the restitution she did had Julian Grey not been looming
large on the premises, that the main thrill is only a sickly
spasm after all. As Mercy, Miss Achurch wears only
two nice gowns. No. A in crushed straw berry velveteen,
trimmed with silk beaded with passementerie to corres-
pond, No. 2 in brown velveteen with a Watteau book and
crinkled sleeves of flesh-pink silk, the Medici collar lined
with the silk.
The Manly Wild Flower Show (this year in aid of the
local Cottage Hospital), opened by Mayoress Burdekin,
was a big success, as such things go, and in no small
degree owed its attractiveness to the energy and good
taste displayed by Mrs. H. T. Robey, who superintended
the floral arrangements. Mr. H. T. Smith was awarded
first prize for the best floral design ; Miss Madeline Fitz-
Stubbs secured the prize for best bouquet; Miss Fox was
victorious in the best-dozen-buttonholes department;
and it was decreed that Miss Ella Richards had supplied
the best basket of flowers. A rather curious feature of
the show was that the appearance of Mrs. Burdekin was
greeted with the National Anthem.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
The Narrabri Oddfellows’ Ball took place on September
17, and we are informed by a local participant that a more
brilliant “ shivoo " never eventuated in that part of the
globe. Mr. A. T. Bather officiated as M. 0., and the
Misses Walsh and Coleman and Mesdames Goddard and
Lilieyman, in the writer’s opinion, earned the pastry.
The engagement of Captain Barlow, of H.M.S. Orlando,
to Miss Dight, daughter of Mr. Arthur Dight, of “ Lans-
downe,” Darling Point, Sydney, has been announced.
The captain of H.M.S. Royalist is also engaged—to marry
a rich Victorian widow.
The Buttercup spinsters held a successful dance at
Needs’ rooms on 26th ult., when the proceedings were
quite up to the title. Yellow was much worn, and posies
and button-holers of the glased yellow blossoms that have
had such a run lately were greatly affected. The affair
was most enjoyable.
A bevy of ladies intend to organise a “ Court ” ball, to
be held at West’s rooms at an early date, when powder
and patches will be the main idea for the ladies, while the
gentlemen will wear silk stockings and swords (obviously'
an invitation to amateur mounted policemen). Under
such circumstances it is pleasant to reflect that sawdust
is still down and sticking-plaster remains firm.
The plain and costume ball given by Mr. and Mrs.
George Brook, of “L’Avenue,” Newtown, was a most en-
joyable festivity, concluding in the early morning. Mrs.
Brock wore a very complete Dorothy dress; Miss Oarran,
pale heliotrope silk ; Miss E. Scott (Darling Point) peach-
coloured silk and cream lace ; Mrs. Fischer Cripps, black
silk and jet with blush roses. The music by a string
hand was excellent, and floor and supper were welt
managed.
The ball given by the gay bachelors of the Union Club,
last week, was a lively festivity, punctuated with pot
plants - the screening of Need’s band in a grove of scrip-
tural palms contributing greatly to the witchery of the
waltzes. Lady Carington wore white gauze striped with
silver with a garland of pale-pink roses, diamond tiara
necklet and bracelets—her posy of primroses and violets
hardly harmonising with the gown ; Lady Hopetoun in
biaok with a foot border of blush roses, diamond jewels;
Mrs. Aoland Hood also in black relieved with scarlet roses
and autumn leaves. Most of the dresses had made their
debut on a previous occasion.

The theatrical profession, as well as the
amateurs, will learn with genuine satisfaction
that Mr. Gilbert J. Smith has opened a depdt
which he designates “Noah’s Ark” with a large
and a fully-assorted equipment of “ stage proper-
ties and requisites,” in Pitt-street, opposite the Cri-
terion, Sydney. Mr. Smith should have his hands
full, as he has no evident competition in his line in
Sydney.
The enterprising firm of the London and
Sydney Tea Company have removed their offices
to 167 Clarence-street. This company is going
straight ahead, acting up to its motto of a single
package at wholesale price, thus making every
cocky and farmer in the land his own tea-mer-
chant. Their travellers visit every homestead in
this colony and Queensland, and are made welcome
at the front-door by the missus, while the boss of
the shanty, armed with a flint-lock gun or a rusty
sword, chases the much-maljgned book-agent out
the back way, clear of the cultivation. Their
teas can with confidence be recommended, and
such recommendation will not be abused, as the
company pride themselves on the fact that their
ever-increasing business is due solely to their
principle of giving full value for money received.
Victorian Anglicans breathe freely now
that they have seen—and heard —the new Pri-
mate. There was always the chance that Right
Reverend “Saumarez Sydney” might intel-
lectually dwarf Field Flowers Melbourne. But
with Sydney’s appearance in Christ Church
(South Yarra) pulpit the other evening the
Victorians’ fear has vanished, and the smug com-
placency of the pious parties who are so grateful
for affliction (when it visits their neighbours) has
taken its place. The only point of comparison
between the two bishops is that it’s a toss-up
which is the more commonplace. The Primate’s
address at Christ Church was pitifully weak. With
the &ite of Melbourne Anglicism for his congrega-
tion, he got off some flabbiness which would have
discredited a Bible Christian local preacher at a
country circuit tea-fight. The only remark
worthy of notice was a miserable solecism.
Referring to the “ union of the Christian with the
Christian’s God,” he made his allusion by a paltry
attempt at emphasis with an antithesis which
reflected disadvantageously on Labour Unions.
There could be not the slightest doubt in the mind
of anyone who heard him that, when he con-
trasted the union of the “Church” with
“the unions which do not help but hinder,”
he was giving a back-hander to Trades-Unionism.
Which was a proceeding not at all surprising con-
sidering that just nine hours had elapsed since he
had landed in Melbourne, and almost every
moment of the time had been spent in monopolistic
company, but it was a most impolitic proceeding
all the same, if the Primate really intends to act
up to the statement expressed at Bishop Goe’s
garden-party —“ that his chief desire is to influence
the working-man.” The two bishops perambulated
Melbourne streets on Saturday last and many
Melbournites had to take a second look to make
sure which was Goe and which was the Primate.
This remark will at once identify the new-comer
as possessing a most imposing physique. The
Bulletin is not going, on so short an acquaint-
ance, to pronounce the new Primate a Chadband,
but he has got the Chadbandish trick of piling up
epithets. “ Dear Christian brethren and Christian
sisters and Christian friends —the union and the
co-operation and the joining together—the Chris-
tian mind, and the Christian heart, and the
Christian spirit ’’—are chunks from his Melbourne
address.
We notice with pleasure that the Equitable
Mortgage, Discount, and Deposit Bank, of 4
Moore-street, Sydney, has recently been incor-
porated, and is now opened for business. .. This
bank has been formed for the purpose of assisting
those who may at any time be in pecuniary diffi-
culties and wish to avoid paying the excessive in-
terest which is too often charged. The bank has
secured the able services of Mr. Henry A. Birk-
myre, which should be a guarantee that clients will
be fairly dealt with. In these days of extortion, the
above institution should about fill a long-felt
want.*

which are extra fat and voracious, and by them-
selves christened, for that reason, capuchins and

tory to their dignity to reply to such attacks.”
These onslaughts upon cheap labour should be
more discriminate. Labour has no reason to fear
any worker who lands here with his hands un-
trammelled. It is the man bound by previously-
signed contract to toil for old country wages that
becomes a dangerous foe. It is necessary to shut
out the cheap-living Italian, German, Britisher,
who, like rice-eating Chinamen, are to all intents
the slave of the middleman who import them, but
the intelligent, industrious freeman of any country
is a valuable ally.

ing if he solidifies his alleged position as such by
sneering at the race of the Saviour who he behevee
died between two thieves to save him. The Jew,
trampled for long ages beneath the feet of tyranny,
may, now that he has got into freedom’s sun-
light, often be unduly aggressive ; in that respect
he is, from similar causes, on equal terms with the
peasant-millionaire who has arisen from the Irish
bogs and made a fortune in a new and freer
country. To the Jews the world owes much
beside its Saviour. -tyWhere is the race which can

Tales of “The System.”
No.XII.— “The Hanging of the Eighteen’
(Knotting the Rope).
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Rev. Thomas Taylor, 8.A., Pro-
testant Chaplain of the Penal Establishment,
Norfolk Island, had some curious notions. One
of them was to keep posted over the entrance of
his study a sheet of paper on which be had
neatly printed with his pen these words ;
“ Before tub Throne of Zeus,” says Hesiod, “ Dike
WEEVB WHENEVER THE EARTHLY JUDGE DECIDES WRONGLY.”
Underneath this quotation he had written in
his ordinary handwriting this sentence;
“No wonder, then, sculptors represent Justice with
hound eyes. She has gone weeping blind.”
Below this, again, he had jotted down a long
aeries of dates. Against each date he had put a
word —generally a man’s name—to serve as a
memory-peg. It was thus ho kept a succinct
record of the more unjust sentences pronounced
on the Island by Summary or Superior Court
the Saturday evening on which the Special
Commission concluded its sittings, Mr. Taylor,
as soon as the prisoners were removed, went
straight from the Temporary Court House, alias
the Butcher's Shop, to his study.
Hearing his footstep on the verandah, where the
moonlight was playing hide-and-seek with the
shadows east by the trellis, Mrs. Taylor, who was
waiting for him in her sitting-room, called out:
“Tea is ready, dear !”
“i’ll be with you presently,’ he replied. i
am simply completing my list.” As he laid down
his pen, after inscribing an addition to the paper
attached to the wall, he murmured to himself: ‘ I
may draw a line now. To-day is the climax.
Justice will weep no more after to-day, for the
fount of her tears will have dried up.”
And he took his ruler and a pencil, and traced
a thick stroke under his final entry, which read
14th November, 184 —. Special Commission (Qay-
thorpe). Arraignments, 57 ; acquittals, 9. Convictions
Death, 20 ; death recorded, 3 ; life, 7 ; ten years, 5 ; four
years, 12. Tappin’s case was reserved for the Chief
Justice.
The parson underscored Tappin’s name—doubly
underscored it, as though otherwise he might
forget the special fact which it was his wish to
remember. He went into the pleasant room
where his wife was waiting for him. As she
turned up the lamp she watched his face. Through
its pallor, like that of the moonlight, glared a,
great pain, and when he bent his hands into his
palms, as he craved a blessing on the food, he
let them rest there so long that she grew alarmed.
“Are you ill, dear?” she asked, at last.
“No,” he replied, looking up, “not ill, but
pained—wearied —puzzled—puzzled that such
things are permitted to be. Twenty—great God !
Twenty /—are to hang on Monday morning at
nine o’clock!” ... .. .
He glanced at his watch and then continued
“In 35 hours and 20 minutes 20 men hang—
hang — hang ! And I am their pastor—their spiri-
tual father, responsible for them to God !;’ _
He placed his head on the table and his misery
wrung a moan from him.
Mrs. Taylor was a good woman and anything
but a commonplace woman, and her husband’s
tenderness had stood between her and the petrify-
ing influences of the System. Still there was
something of the conventional in her nature, and
it must have been this element that prompted her
next observation. Your good woman is so fearful
of new paths that for anything to have been done
before is to confer a kind of sanctity both on the
deed and its doer. Stifling her own sensation of
horror at his news, she tried to relieve him of part
of his burden,
“ I can’t understand, dear,” she said, “why you
should be so much affected. Many clergymen
have had similar responsibilities .”
“ The Law and the System took care of that!”
bitterly interjected Mr. Taylor.
“ And they did not break down,” his wife went
on. “You know what you often say in the
pulpit—‘ The back is strengthened to the burden. ’ ”
“Yes, yes! ” he answered her, with a sad im-
patience. “So it is; and I’ll get through the
work somehow —to the satisfaction of Mr. Scragge,
at least. But it’s not myself I’m thinking of, God
knows ! It’s the men—the twenty —to think of
them going before their Maker and their Judge as
they are—sin-stained, crime-stained, hardened of
heart, reprobate of conscience—blaspheming the
Deity, cursing their fellow-men, or jesting and
jeering with gibes on their lips that are viler than
curses —oh, ’tis terrible !”
His wife had never seen him so moved. She
tried to soothe him with the little tricks of manner
and speech that womanhood calls to its aid when
it wishes to calm the irritation of the menkind.
She rose, and passed her arm round his neck.
“Dear,” she said softly, “don’t take it so much
to heart! It’s not even as though there was no
one to help you in preparing these poor men for—
for Monday. There is Father MTndoe, you know,
and Mr. Ford ”
The Rev. Mr. Taylor, not being altogether a
saint, had more than once during their wedded
existence answered his wife rather rudely, but he
had never acted roughly towards her, or used in
her presence coarse language.
Judge, therefore, of her surprise when he,
rising, flung off her arm, and not so much said as
shouted ;
“Damn Mr. Ford!”
* # •
Seeing his wife’s astonishment and sorrow
very plainly written on her features, the Chaplain
stopped in the walk in which he was swinging
himself up and down the room.
“ I am very sorry, Mary, that I forgot myself.
I beg your pardon—but my nerves are unstrung
strange isn’t it” (here he laughed hysterically)
“that I’m unstrung because they’re to be up-
strung.” , ,
“ Tom! ” said his wife, greatly pained and
alarmed. “Tom !”
“ Yes, dear, I’m wrong I know—l shouldn t
pun on such a thing, should I ? But I’m going to
turn over a new leaf—l’m not going to feel anymore
—l’m going to harden —I’m going to be a faithful
and subservient servant to the System, like —like
my senior, Ford. ’
“ Tom!” once more reproachfully exclaimed Mrs.
Taylor.
“Oh, yes, I am, Mary. I shall model mysell
in future on Brother Ford ; good man, Brother
Ford —most useful man, Brother Ford. Is there
a juror short? Brother Ford will act with plea-
sure! Does the Attorney-General stumble for
want of a precedent ? Brother Ford will furnish
one! Is the Commissioner in doubt as to the
law? Brother Ford, from the jury-box, settles
the point, with the assurance of a Lord Chief
Justice ! Does the Olcrk of Arraigns bungle in
mi indictment? Brother Ford is at his elbow
with a correction ! Is a prisoner’s record faulty .
Brother Ford supplies a material omission from
the treasures of his memory—says the prisoner at
the bar killed a woman in fiobart Town nine
years ago—record says nothing—Brother lord
asks from the jury-box, prisoner at the bar, didn t
he? —prisoner at the bar replies yes! Oh, most
useful man, Ford ! He’ll assist me with the last
Communion of the Condemned —and then, per-
haps, offer to assist the hangman —perhaps be one
of the hangmen, for they’ll want two on Monday,
will Brother Ford !”
“Tom! are you mad ?”
“ No, dear—not mad ; at least I don’t think so.
Parson Ford isn’t mad, and the System adores
him, and I’m going to follow his example. 1 will
get another hundred pounds a year when I m like
him —‘ increment of salary to the Rev. 1 nomas
Taylor, 8.A., for hardening his heart. One
hundred pounds! that would read well in the
annual report, wouldn’t it, dear ? Ah ! ah ! Iso,
I’m not mad —I have been—l’m getting sane
now. I shall not fight the System any longer;
I’ll knock under, as the —men —say. 1 he System s
beaten me.” . .
Whether it was the System, or physical weak-
ness, that had defeated Mr. Taylor, we can’t say ;
but ho had no sooner spoken the last words than
he fell to the floor—not merely beaten, indeed, but
completely “knocked out.” His utterance had
been getting thicker and less intelligible to his
wife’s shocked ears, and as his speech grew more
incoherent, his walk changed from a slide to a
stagger.
Half-an-hour subsequently Dr. Grocott pro-
nounced him to be suffering from bram-fever.
During the preceding week the Chaplain had been
subjected to an intense physical and mental strain
by the tragedy in the chapel and then by the pro-
ceedings of the Special Commission. The awful
scenes which had characterised the session, with
their ghastly prologue, had had the effect of
breaking away the link which held an already
over-taxed constitution to health and sanity.
To this circumstance it was that the Condemned,
or, rather, such of them as were Protestants, were
indebted for that most precious of privileges—the
attendance of Senior Chaplain the Rev. iheophilus
Ford on them during their last hours.
* * *
It was something, let us tell you, for a
“ Black Norfolker ” to have Parson Ford’s minis-
trations. It was a distinction by virtue of rarity,
for the rare is, or should be, always precious. Not
that the Senior Chaplain’s attendance at these little
affairs of ceremony was a rare event —not at all;
for, up to the year of which we write. Parson
Ford had been present at upwards of
“ swingings,” as he termed them. Like his great
namesake and distant connection, the celebrated
Ordinary of Newgate, he enjoyed within his own
sphere a monopoly of the gallows. That sphere,
however, was at Hobart Town and its neighbour-
ing convict-stations, and so constantly pressing
were his duties there that he had never previously
spared the time for a trip to the Island. To tell
the truth, the Senior Chaplain could never absent
himself from his accustomed corner of the Vine-
yard without coming under the influence of an
uneasy feeling that things would go wrong in the
Capital. It was as though he suspected that a
criminal, who had the misfortune to be hanged
while he was away would receive but a cold wel-
come from the door-guard of Hades. Fortunately,
however, for his health’s sake and the equanimity
of his tamper, the consideration suggested it sell
that when visiting the Island the Los® °t the
Condemned in Hobart Town would be the Lam
of the Condemned at Norfolk; The latter would
have him if the former had him not. And so it
was that when Chaplain Taylor broke down, his
senior was ready at a moments notice to take his
place.
• # «
He preached to the Condemned on the
Sunday morning. Fifteen of them listened to
him ; the other five doomed to die were Roman
Catholics, and were at that moment in sobbing
penitence before Father M‘lndoe. It was very
impressive, that discourse, and on the whole in
very good taste —for Parson Ford, that is. The
chief fault that such of his auditors as were
principally concerned with its application found
in it was that it had not been specially written for
the occasion. . .
As they stood on the Chapel corridor waiting
for the word to move off to the condemned cells,
whence the majority of them, perhaps all (for it
was not yet known whether any would be re-
prieved) would never emerge except on to the
gallows, they discussed the discourse.
“ Well,” said Gooch, “ as th’ ol’ man ain’t 6d so
big a job as this afore, I did think he’d hey taken
some trouble over it, but I’m danged if it aimt th
same ol’ stuff as he shelled out the day afore I was
’preeved (reprieved) in ’38.”
“Yes,” said Martin Cash, “I remember. Bush-
ranger Cash was wearing his 471 b. irons that day ;
his Sunday suit, as he called them, for they were
never put on him except when he was taken to
chapel. His ordinary irons scaled at forty pounds,
but, doubtless to aid his devotions, an additional
half-stone was locked on him on chapel-days.
(You can see the Sunday-suit in Oscott Museum,
near Birmingham, England, any day you may
happen to bo in the neighbourhood. Bishop
Willson took them home to show a committee of
the House of Commons—meddlesome fellow, that
Bishop.) “ I remember,” repeated Cash; “ I was
one of the crew that time, warn’t I, Goochy?”
“ Yer was, Cash, lad,” said Gooch. “They
'preeved you same time as me. ”
“ Yes,” rejoined the once mighty ’ranger, medi-
tatively ; “yes, they 'preeved me—l never ’ad no
luck at all.' I ’orter been worked oi’f years an’
years ago. Three times ordered to be scragged
an’ never scragged onst! Drew the straw onst,
too, an’ th’ sneak funked.* Never ’ad no luck
since I stuck up thet’ooman at Cons’tushun ill
an’ rob’d ’er of ’er fawney.t Boys’—here bespoke
with a mock earnestness, as though he were some
venerable preacher, beseeching innocent young
souls not to wander from the paths they should
go—“ Boys, as sure as ye rob a’ooman ye’ll’ave
bad luck, and ’tickerly if you rob ’er of ’er fawney.
Don’ ye never, boys—else ye’ll ’ave bad luck.”
They mimicked his solemnity as they severally
assured him “by their honor,” “by their ’davy
(affidavit)” and by sundry other standards of
asseveration that they would never—no never-do
such a thing. And as all Martin’s auditors were
* “ Drew the straw.”—Three men, tired of life, would
get together, and, by drawing straws of various lengths,
decide which of the three was to murder one of the
others, and thus secure “liberty” for the lot—for the
murderer and the witness would be hanged. The victim
was said to “ draw the straw.” Occasionally, hut rarely,
the man who drew the longest straw, and was thereby
selected as the murderer, “funked” the awful task. The
straw-drawing ceremony is said to have occurred nearly
forty times at Norfolk Island.

on the “ooffin-list ” for next day, their promise
had more than an unusually good chance of fulfil-
ment.
The conversation of the callous wretches was
rudely interrupted by Under-gaoler and Turnkey
Tuff. “ March !” he cried, and jangled his keys.
The soldiers’ guard, who had grounded their
muskets, now brought them to the “ready,” and
at the point of the bayonet the Condemned were
ushered to their cells. Four prisoners and a
convict-constable went into each of the 9 feet-by-3
compartments. Civil Commandant Scragge did
not like straw-drawing; statements having
reference to that pernicious practice looked so
“ demnition bad ”in the Annual Report; and as
an obstacle to any of the Condemned cheating the
Law, he had installed a constable in each cell.
Which was very unfortunate, sometimes, for the
constables.
Into the cell wherein Richard Johnson, John
Saunders, and Gooch were hustled was also forced,
shrinkingly, Convict-constable Chuckem. This
was the fellow who had sworn falsely against the
D Gangers on their trial, and whose perjury—
as yet unpunished—had been exposed by Johnson.
“Please, Mr. Tuff, —sir,” gasped the trembling
rogue, “ I wasn’t with this lot afore chapel—l was
with Cash, sir, and his ”
“Go in there, I tell you,” said Tuff, with an
oath, “or you shall go to I) Gang—there’ll be a
heap of vacancies there arter to-morrow. Go in,
I say !” And the turkey slammed the door.
“Thews’ll be murder here, sir, there will!” cried
the craven, through the grating of the door.
There was,
* * *
“ Coffin-list ” was due Avith the tea at
four o’clock. That is to say, the final list. At
that hour Scragge would wait on the Condemned
and notify such of them as it was not intended to
hang that a reprieve had been granted in then-
cases. The prerogative of mercy, after a Court of
Special Commission, was exercised by the Special
Commissioner, the Civil Commandant, and the
Military Commandant in conjunction. There
was no time to refer the capital sentences to his
Excellency at Hobart Town had there been any
inclination to do so, for the Imperial Act passed
in the reign of the Fourth William, which extended
the interval between the passing of the sentence
and the execution, had not, at this period, been
applied to Norfolk Island. Consequently the
death-sentences passed by the Commission were
reviewed by substantially the same body that
ordained them in the first instance.
Justice had doomed 20 men to die, but to adapt
the words of Portia —“Mercy was above the
sceptred sway of Justice,” on this occasion. No
more than 18 were to be executed.
The conclave of doom was held immediately
after forenoon chapel. Naturally the Special
Commissioner and the C.C. desired the sentences
to stand as they were. What was the use of all
the preliminaries if they were to be revised ?
But the Military Commandant, Major Atchison,
was firm. He would not consent to an execution
which was to “ break the record.”
“Nineteen men have been hanged before in the
old colony on one morning, but never more. I’ll
not consent to have my name attached to a war-
rant for any greater number. I have no ambition
to top the list.”
“Oh, I don’t mind,” blustered Scragge, “and
1 think you’re wrong. Major. I think they hung
20 once in Sydney. But Ave'll ask Parson Fora-
he’ll be sure to know. He’s got all this sort of
thing at his fingers’ ends.”
So Parson Ford was sent for, and came in due
course.
“Parson,” said the Civil Commandant, “You’re
a regular ‘ Criminal Calendar ’ in breeches —you’ll
excuse the term.”
The Senior Chaplain bowed at the compliment,
and intimated he was at the service of the authori-
ties.
“Well,” pursued the 0.0., “the Major here’s
got a little squeamish as to executing a full score
at once. ”
“ A full score for string instruments !” was the
recondite pun here interjected by the jocular
Special Commissioner.
“Ha, ha! Very good,”laughed Scragge.
“Look here, Gaythorpe, it’s a dem’d shame —
apologising to you, Chaplain—to joke on such
matters. It may seem all right for you gentlemen
of Law and Civil Order to treat ’em so flippantly,
but to me it is no laughing business to hang twenty
fellows, perhaps half of whom have been made
what they are by the System.”
The Major didn’t like the System. It was he,
indeed, who, later, urged on Bishop Willson to
make that famous trip “Home,” which did so
much to injure It. His outburst on the present
occasion would have led to a pretty quarrel had
not Chaplain Ford intervened.
“Gentlemen, gentlemen !” he cried, in the suave
tones of the professional peacemaker. “ This sort
of thing is—ah—not quite the thing, you know, on
Sunday. Now, pray tell me in what way I can be
of service to you ?”
“ What is the biggest number of men hanged at
one time in the colonies, can you tell us, Mr,
Ford?” queried the C. 0., in savage accents.
“Major Achison says no more than nineteen have
been hanged at one time. I say more have.”
“I’m afraid (placing an apologetic stress on
the word) that the Major’s right,” said the Chap-
lain, who was more desirous of supporting the
Civil Commandant than the Military. “The
largest number top’d off at once was one day in
August of ’2l, when nineteen were executed simul-
taneously in George-street, Sydney. But we should
surpass that to-morrow.”
“ I’ll be hanged if you will!” rudely interrupted
the Major, rising.
“ That’ll make 21, in that case,” joked the Com-
missioner.
“I was about to say when the Major inter-
rupted me,” complacently continued the parson,
“ provided you did not issue reprieves.”
“ But reprieves shall issue,” said the Military
Commandant excitedly. “I won’t hang 20—1
won’t even hang 19—I’ll consent to 18, but no
more. So you can make your choice, Mr. Scragge
—I suppose you’ve got a favourite or two among
the wretches ? ”
The C.C. apparently did not notice the con-
cluding sneer. All he said was, that if they were
to execute 18 only, Martin Cash should be one re-
prieved. He’d heard, he said, that that notorious
criminal had actually wagered his boots that he’d
be hanged this time. He’d like to disappoint him,
he would. That would cause Cash to lose the
wager, and then he’d make him go for six months
without any boots. Wagering Government pro-
perty, indeed ! He’d teach Mr. Cash a lesson.
By the time Mr. Cash had done a stretch in D
Gang without boots he’d have learnt not to bet
with what didn’t belong to him. And so on. And
so on.
Mr. Commissioner Gaythorpe was shocked e*
this revelation of the ex-bushranger’s depravity,
and was quite willing to accept the suggestion.
“ I’m agreeable,” grumpily assented the Major.
“And if you’ll take my advice, Mr. Scragge,
you’ll reprieve that Saunders also. My officers
have begun to think it won’t do them any good if
it gets known down at Hobart Town that they
found a man guilty who wore the tube-gag during
his trial. And I must say I agree with them.
Villiers, of the Onetyths, won’t like it, I know.”
Colonel Villiers, of the Onety-Oneths, was Colonel-
Commanding in V.D.L., and the Norfolk Island
detachment of the 50th Regiment was therefore
under his control. He had indulged a mortal
hatred of the System since it had flogged and
killed Captain Egerton of his regiment.*
The Civil Commandant, not caring for any more
fuss, adopted the suggestion. It was quite im-
material to him, he said, who was the second man.
And so it was decided.
“ I am very glad,” said Parson Ford, as he and
the Commissioner were crossing the Grassplot to
lunch at Government House. “ I am really
pleased that your Honor has not reprieved that
hardened wretch who called God as a witness in
the Court last week. It was too blasphemous
altogether !”
One of the arraigned men had, when interro-
gated as to whether he had any witnesses to pro-
duce on his behalf, called on the Deity !
“ Yes,” rejoined Mr. Commissioner Gaythorpe,
“ That was very bad. Put for my part, I don’t
see why the Major should have been so punc-
tilious. If you’ve got to hang 18, you might-
just as well hang 20—so far as I can see, it's only
postponing the business a little for the other
two.”
“ That is so,” said the Minister of the Gospel.
“ But ” —oh, what a devoutness breathed in these
sighing accents ! —“it gives the two so much the
longer an opportunity for repentance. I only
hope Brother Taylor, when he recovers, will make
the most of it, in the interests of their salvation !”
“ A thought has just struck me,” exclaimed Mr.
Gaythorpe. “ Gad ! Pity it didn’t occur to mo
before we rose. We couldn’t have a better
example than the old country, could we?”
“No,” replied the Parson, “ certainly not !”
“ Well, they’ve hanged more than 20 in one day
in London, I’ll be bound, and if it’s right there, it
can’t be wrong here. Strange, now, we didn’t
think of that precedent !”
“Pardon me,” said Ford, “but I think the
largest—ah—transaction of the kind that has
taken place for 60 years was at Newgate, in
January, ’B9, when 19 of the Gordon rioters were
—ah—swung : off. You see, we couldn’t go
further back than 1788. The precedent wouldn’t
a PPIy- The glorious old flag didn’t wave here
before.”
“But,” persisted his Honor the Special Com-
missioner, “I distinctly remember Warren, Q.C.
- Diary of a Late Physician Warren, you
know—telling us at a circuit dinner-only time I
went on circuit, by Jove !—these rascals of
attorneys wouldn’t brief me, so gave it up—ha !
ha ! —I remember old Warren said he was once at
a Newgate Condemned sermon, when 60 prisoners
sat with their feet on their coffins. So, you see,
if they’d gone so far as to give the men their
shells, they’d be bound to hang most of them.”
“ Well,” reflected the Chaplain, “ there may be
a precedent for hanging twenty, but I am not
acquainted with it. Anyhow, it’s too late now.
You’ve decided to reprieve two.”
Shortly before four o’clock, Mr. Scragge
passed to the gaol. Parson Ford aocom pained
him. Turnkey Tuff received them. Turnkey
Tuff saluted, and said respectfully to his chief,
“ May I ask how many, sir?”
“ Only eighteen,” snorted the C.C. “We shall
have to hang ’em in batches, eh, Tuff?”
“As you please, sir,” answered the functionary.
“ Shall I send for the executioner?”
Scragge nodding, the death-man was sent for.
The 0.0. and the parson moved towards the per-
manent gallows.
“ Why not drop ’em all at once, Mr. Scragge ?”
questioned the Chaplain.
“I don’t think the beam’s strong enough,” re-
plied Mr. Scragge.
The Senior Chaplain scanned the tarred beam
with the eye of a connoisseur. “ Oh,” he made
answer, “ I don’t doubt it’ll do, Mr. Scragge.
You know, sir, I’ve had a little experience in these
matters, and I certainly think it will serve for the
eighteen. I am sure, indeed, that twenty could
die comfortably here together.”
The Commandant would doubtless have decided
to have “dropped ’em all at once,” but for the
executioner —one Somers. Somers was diffident.
“Please, Mr. Scragge and your Rev’renco, I
don’ think as I can do it neat—leastways not th’
eighteen, sir, to wunst. I ’udn’t care to tackle
more’n six at a time.”
And as, in spite of pressure, he stuck to his
resolve—he possessed the true artist’s appreciation
of a neat finish to his work, did Hangman Somers,
and hated anything like a bungle—it was ordered
to be “sixes.”
“Wot ’bout ’sistants, sir?” Mr. Scragge was
reminded by the Finishing Schoolmaster of the
Law.
“Ah, yes, 1 was forgetting—Tuff, call for
volunteers from the Settlement-yard only— not
at Longridge or Cascades —at tea-time. Two’ll be
wanted—try the young hands, Tuff, the young
hands and short-termers. They’ll have no preju-
dices in favour of the swingers.”
“And the payment, sir ?”
“Oh, the usual thing, of course. Six figs of
tobacco and four ounces rum down, and a ticket
when the brig comes back.”
# * *
There were 22 applications for the billet
of assistant-hangman. The ticket-of-leave was
the inducement, of course. What wouldn’t men
do to obtain a passport from Hell ? And yet the
appeal for volunteers was made to 400 men !
Executioner Somers was sent for to make the
selection of his assistants. It was an embarras de
choix, and he did not care to pick out his men.
To have done that would have occasioned ill-
feeling among the rejected, and not for worlds
would Hangman Somers have hurt the sensibilities
of the candidates.
Tuff was about to suggest putting the names of
the 22 in a cap and drawing two, when a happy
thought struck Mr. Somers. He was a Pembroke-
shire man, and there still lingered in his brain a
recollection of one of the counting-out rhymes
which boys use in picking sides. So he chanted
the old “romass ” of his county :
Onethery, twothery, ackeryan
TJibtail, bobtail, kiddling jan,
Hamm Scarum, Josey Marum,
Chiddo!
Up and down the line he went, 800 contemptuous
and scornful eyes watching him as he touched a

man with extended forefinger at each word and
told another to fall out at every repetition of
“Ohiddo!” Up and down till two were left. An
eloquent groan volleyed round the couple as they
followed their preceptor; but it was not so elo-
quent a sound as the hiss which, accompanying
a rooking vibration of the mass, marked the swal-
lowing up of the 20 by the ranks of their comrades.
The twenty had made their bid for freedom—
and had failed ; and now they were to know the
retribution which always waits on failure and
defeat. Vce Victis! Woe to the conquered!
This is the universal cry ; but never has it so
intolerable an anguish as when shrieked by the
Conquered themselves in the ears of such of their
own number as Fate acquaints with a deeper
shame than burdens most.
Another pip on the die—and the gamester would
have retrieved past ruin and gained new fortune !
Another place to the right or left in the rank
(thought each of the twenty), would have meant
Freedom ! The one chance of a lifetime —and
such a lifetime ! —had gone for them. Twelve
months hence, perhaps, another such opportunity
would present itself, but in twelve months where
would they be ? As likely as not in the condemned
cells themselves. So thought each of the twenty
as the darts of his comrades’ ridicule played about
him. Each cursed his luck!
#- # #
But there were different kinds of luck.
When Commandant Scragge and Parson Ford
left the yallows, they passed to where the
“ swingers ” were waiting the arrival of the
“coffin-list.” With them went Tuff and a junior
turnkey, the last bearing pencil and paper. Fol-
lowing the British precedents so justly esteemed
by Mr. Commissioner Gaythorpe. the Condemned
were allowed to order their own breakfast for the
fatal day, and it was the junior-turnkey’s duty to
note the bill-of-fare.
The compartments occupied by the doomed men
opened on to the one corridor. At the entrance
to this were grouped, as the Commandant came
up, several warders and soldiers, all evidently
under considerable excitement.
“Chuckem’s killed, sir,” said a warder, saluting.
“ Convict Constable Chuckem—killed in No. 18
by Johnson, Gooch, and Saunders ! ’
“Phew !” whistled the C.C. He turned to the
Chaplain, and remarked : “Lucky, isn’t it, we
reprieved Saunders? We’ve got him to try now.
If we hadn’t, we wouldn’t have had a soul to
indict for this affair !” Then he asked for parti-
culars. None of the group knew anything except
that Johnson had called through the grating that
they had “paid Chuckem off ” for bearing false
witness in Courri The officers couldn’t get into
the cell, pending Tuff’s arrival with the keys.
Scragge moved down the corridor towards No.
18. A voice from No. 16 hailed him. “Hello,
Mr, Scragge, you ain’t taken my order, sir.
Ftied eggs and bacon, please* sir, and coffee ”
“Oh, is that you, Cash?” queried the C.C.,
stopping in his walk, and peering into the face
which blocked-up the grating of No. 16. “ But
you’re not goin’ to swing my man, yet. Plain
nominy for you in the morning.”
“ Wot, sir, yer don’t mean as how yer’ve
’preeved me ?”
“That’s just what Ido mean, Martin. You’ve
lost your boots,” chuckled the Commandant.
“Well, I’m ” exclaimed Cash, despond-
ingly. “ I never ’ad no luck—no,, never. Yer
might ’a done me a good turn., pa’son—ye and me’s
ol’ fren’s. Yer might ’a put me on th’ coffin-list.
I’d ’a done as much fur ye, sir.”
No. 17 was occupied by three of the Catholic
Condemned. Father Melndoe stood before the
door. “You’ll want all of my lads to-morrow,
Mr. Scragge ?” he asked, sadly, bowing to Parson
Ford.
“Yes,” said the C.C. “All! What’ll they
take for breakfast ?”
“You might give them a good meal to-night,
Mr. Scragge, ana to-morrow a cup of coffee at seven
o’clock. I perform mass at six o’clock, and
they will not breakfast. But old Hogan has a
special favor to ask you, sir. He is in No. 19.”
At No. 18, Scragge stopped. The grinning
features of Johnson filled up the apertures. The
Commandant questioned him: “Is this true,
Johnson?”
There was no pretence on the ruffian’s part of
ignorance as to what Scragge meant. “Yes,
sir,” he replied ; “ We’ve done for Chuckem. An
speaking for myself, I can shake hands with old
Ketch tol’rable ’appy !”
“ Happy, with this new crime on your con-
science 1” ejaculated Parson Ford. “ And one for
which you can’t be punished !” Parson Ford
never considered a crime could be repented of till
it had been visited with its appointed penalty.
“Yes, sir,” rejoined Johnson, calmly. “I’ll
die now wi’ only two thin’s on ray conshunce.”
“Come,” said the Senior Chaplain, in his best
Ministerial voice; “ Come, John on, tell me
what they are ? Confession is good for the soul,
you know. ”
“If you’d like to know, then, it’s jest this—thet
I can’t shake hands wi-’ Parson Taylor agen, an’
thet I ain’t killed Knatchbull.” Knatchbull was
the convict who had laid the plot which had re-
sulted in the conviction of Johnson and most
others of the D Gang, though he himself, by the
direction of the Court, was acquitted. “Anyhow,
Knatchbull shan’t live long,” the wretch continued,
“ for th’ Ring has sworn his death.”
While this talk had been proceeding between
Johnson and the Chaplain, Tuff threw open the
cell-door, and went inside. Stooping at the ex-
tremity of the cell, over a huddled heap of some-
thing, he drew it into the corridor.
Father MTndoe covered his face. Even Parson
Ford shuddered. But Scragge turned it over with
his foot.
“ Tuff, see whose ’kerchief they’ve done it with,”
he ordered.
“ Mine !” cried a deep voice from the recess of
the cell, followed by the clanking of irons as the
owner of the voice moved forward to the light.
“ You did it, Saunders?” interrogated the Com-
mandant.
“We’re in it, too,” ?ried Johnson and Gooch,
together.
“Well, any one of you’ll do to try,” said
Scragge, “ but as we’ve already reprieved you,
Counsellor Jock, you’ll serve.”
“’Preeved me!” roared Saunders, “’preeved
me! Wot d’ye want a-’preevin’ me fur? Yer
can’t ’preeve me legally -I ain’t done nothink to
desarve it! It’s too—bad —it’s jest yer spite,
Scraggy—yer wanter keep me ’ere a ’ole year
a-waitin’ trial.”
A word to Tuff, ordering th« interment of
Chuckem that evening—“we’ll be busy enough
to-morrow, Tuff, without this”— and Commandant
Scragge passed on. If economy of time constitutes
virtue, then was the System a very virtuous thing
indeed. The System was not going to waste an
unnecessary moment over so trifling an incident as
the death of a convict-constable ; and so Turnkey
Tuff’s brutality in ordering Chuckem into the cell
passed unrebuked. Which was the typical fate of
a typical action. Uncommonly consistent with
itself was the System.
At No. 19, the O.C. halted once more. “The
Father told me you want to see me, Hogan,” were
the words he sent through the bars.
You remember Hogan, the victim of No. 6006’s
little joke—Hogan, whose discharge-order was
appropriated by No. 6006—Hogan, who should
have been released many years before, but through
“ a clerical error ” of the System was not —Hogan,
who, goaded to desperation by prodding bayonets
and searing whips, drove his trowel between the
shoulder-blades of a brother-ganger? Well, this
Hogan preferred his last request. What do you
think it was ?
Simply that the Commandant would give him
one of his own cigars.
“Sure, and I ain’t had no baccy in gaol, yer
Honor. And I’m dyin’ for a smoke or a chew, sir,
and I’d loike a good ’un for th’ last.”
To the honor of the System be it recorded not
only did he withdraw from his pocket-case a really
choice cheroot, but that Parson Ford tendered
his snuff-box to poor, palsied Ned the Bricky,
saying
“Here, old man, take a pinch.” There was
never any nonsense about Parson Ford. Between
him and Scragge they made old Hogan’s last hours
very happy.
Half-an-hour later, Free Clerk Sutherland
brought to Civil Commandant Scragge, as he sat
on his verandah chatting with the* Commissioner
and Attorney-General Waring and watching the
warm flush paling in the western sky, a paper.
“This is what we call our coffin-list, Mr. Gay-
thorpe,” as taking a gold pencil-case from his
pocket he placed his initials at the foot of the
sheet. “ Would you like to look at it ?”
“Certainly—l’m anxious to see how you manage
everything here. It’s a voucher, I suppose?”
“It is now,” replied the C.C. “My initials
have made it so. Before, it was simply a special
requisition.”
Shall we glance over Mr. Archibald Julian
Gaythorpe’s shoulder? This is a copy of the
paper:—
H.M. PENAL ESTABLISHMENT, NORFOLK ISLAND
SPECIAL REQUISITION.
By Order of the C.C. Dat e~lGth Nov., 18!,-.
No. 446. Checked—Joseph Sutherland.
' E.E.S.
Signature of Ordering Officer.
To the Storekeeper,
“And do you mean,” questioned the Special
Commissioner, “ that the System grants all these
good things to the Condemned ?”
“Yes,” answered Mr. Scragge. “You observe
that it gives them everything they wish for. Some
of these fellows will never have fed so well before
as they will to-morrow morning.”
“I should think not, indeed,” was Mr. Gay-
thorpe’s comment. “ But why is this dated
* 10th ?’ To-day’s only the 15th. ’
“ Well, you see,” said Mr. Scragge, “ Sunday’s
not only a dies non, legally speaking, but we’re
compelled by Regulation to keep it holy. It
wouldn’t do for any of our papers to bear a Sun-
day’s date—we’d get a wigging from head-quarters
if they did. Even our Sunday ration-sheets we
date on Saturdays.”
“Ah, very proper,” said Mr., Gaythorpe ; “ very
proper,- indeed.”
“Storekeeper says we’re out of coffins, sir,”
here interjected Free Clerk Sutherland. “He had
enough made last night to do for the 20 with what
he had in stock, but old Kelly in hospital is dead,
and No. 7531 at Longridge has also cleared out ”
“Well,” said Scragge, sharply, “two men have
been reprieved, and that just makes the number
right.”
“ But there’s Chuckem, sir,” the F.C. respect-
fully reminded the O.C.
“Oh, yes; bother the fellow! Send to the
carpenter, and tell him to put a man on. But Ido
hate Sunday work 1”
There were many shades of piety about the
System, if you liked to take the- trouble to look
for them.
* * #
Monday dawned. A cold, grey mist veiled
the whole Island —an unusual c rcumstance— as
though Nature marked her sense of the appro-
priate by donning a moist shroud, instead of the
glistening, dewy lace-work with which she was
wont to shawl herself on a November morning.
The reveille rolled from the Grassplot through
the Settlement at five o’clock—half-an-hourearlier
than usual—(it was to be a busy day), and called
the dormitories into life, and the cells—to death.
It roused Chaplain Ford. He hastily dressed,
and went forth from Government House to the
Gaol. He whistled as he went.
It roused-Father MTndoe. He lay, folded in a
cloak, on a stretcher in the Gaol-corridor, where
he had laid down at three o’clock, worn out with
agonising. Not for the .souls of his “five lads”
only had he struggled. His faith and his pity had
outleaped the poles of dogma, and the heretics in
the other cells had a share in his orisons.
It roused Mrs. Taylor. Not from sleep, for she
had not slept that night, but from the physical
lethargy into which she had fallen, wearied by her
vigil by the side of her delirious husband’s bed.
She kissed him, and whispering an instruction to a
convict nurse, passed forth—also to the Gaol. Ohe
night she had begged a favour from the Civil
Commandant, and went now to act on it.
It roused the whole Settlement—with some
dozen exceptions—who were to be found among
the Condemned.
# # *
And when they woke, it was with flippant
phrases on their lips. Death was stretching out
his arms to these felons, grinning the while. But
they would give him grin for grin. Eate had
played the game of life with them and had won,
because she used cogged dice. ,But what cared
they ? They were going to take their defeat in
good part; they were going to “ die gamethey
were not going to die in their shoes, for they
would cheat the System by kicking them off. And
they furbished up their wits to make a good show.
Each called to mind some gallows-epigram—-some
jest of the hemp—some Tyburn witticism —and
resolved to fire it off at the spectators, had they
but half a chance. One meant to tell Parson Eopl
that he was confoundedly sorry to leave him
behind, but would take his compliments to his
reverence’s father below ? Another rehearsed his
final colloquy with Scragge, in which he was to
tell the C.C. that he’d be sued for damages if the
contract to hang him was not properly carried
out. A third intended to suggest to the
executioner that as butcher’s-meat was bringing
high prices in’Sydney just then, it would pay to
salt the bodies down, and export them to the old
town. In a word, they were determined to invoke
the ribald spirits of the damned in advance—
But a woman’s hand interposed, and closed the
gates of time behind them softly and sacredly.
# * ' #
A great grief had communicated itself to
Mrs. Taylor- As the tangle of her husband’s
brain unveiled itself in the delirium of fever she
understood, for the first time, the depth of his
solicitude for the doomed men. “The Twenty !”
he would cry, “O, the Twenty !My God, have
mercy 1” Between the cries, be would strive to
rise so that he might go to them. He would be too
late; the death-bell was tolling—and God would
require their souls at his hands! And, worse
than all, beneath all the moaning and shrieking,
panted an undertone of doubt, of which the sub-
ject was Parson Eord.
Then she had been told that the Protestant con-
demned flouted the Senior Chaplain, and would
not hearken to him.
So, after consulting with Father M‘lndoe, she
obtained Soragge’s order to visit the condemned
on the Monday' morning.
* « •
She shared their last Communion with the
thirteen in the chapel. Most of them had resolved
to make the scene one to be never recalled save
with torture by every one with the faintest quality
of reverence; to travesty itto insult the Cross
itself; to make the day unspeakable.
But her presence shamed them.
After the Blessing had been pronounced—was
it merely the fancy that Parson Ford’s tones
sounded less strident than before?—she craved the
Chaplain’s permission to address the men.
He wondered, but did not withhold it.
With hands clenched on her throat as though to
strangle her sobs, and with tears in her voice and
on her cheeks, she made her petition.
“Men —brothers—you know my husband is
lying ill—ill perhaps to death. But even in his
sickness he is grieving over you. That is what I
wish to tell you. And for his sake, for your own
sake, for God’s sake, let me ask you to heed what
Chaplain Ford here tells yon. O men, dear men
—dear brothers—be good, be quiet,’ will you, on
the—when the time comes ” She stopped,
sobbing.
Johnson broke the silence.
“We will, ma’am—we will. I did intend having
some —fun —but I won’t now ”
“O, thank you, thank you !” she cried, after
another pause. “ And now—goodbye 1”
“Ma’am,” said Gooch, “there’s plenty of time
(it wanted a few minutes to eight o’clock). “Read
us somethink.”
She looked at Parson Ford. He nodded —
kindly. Opening her prayer-book she turned to
the psalms for the day, and from the first one
read these verses :
O remember not our old sins, blit have mercy upon us,
and that soon : for we are come to great misery.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Thy
Name: O deliver us, and be merciful unto our sins, for
thy Name’s sake.
O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before
thee : according to the greatness of thy power, preserve
thou those that are appointed to die.
Johnson spoke again when she had concluded ;
“Mann,” he said, “we missed your organ-
playing yesterday. Will ye play some more when
we go out—yonder? We can hear it, you know.”
She promised. Tuff told a constable to go for
the blower—and gave the order to the Condemned
to march. Their breakfasts were waiting in the
corridor, he. said. (The tables were guarded by
trebled rows of bayoneted muskets.)
Mrs. Taylor went to the door. The first of the
clanking file— their irons had not yet been re-
moved —thought she meant to shake hands. But
she put her hands on his shoulders, and, bending
forward, kissed him. Amazed, be went on.
One after another she touched with her lips, till
Gooch and Johnson came, the last two. On them
likewise she would have bestowed the imprint of
her unsullied womanliness, when Johnson stopped
her with upraised hand.
“No, no,” he uttered, hoarsely. “Yer don’
know wot we did yesterday arternoon.”
It was quite true. Into the seclusion of the
sick chamber the news of Chuckem’s murder had
not penetrated.
“What?” she whispered—affrighted at what she
knew not. ' V
“We —killed—Chuckem, marm. Don’ yer touch
us—we ain’t wuth it!”
She lived a year in the next moment, but she
did not falter. To them, too, she gave thebenison
of her kiss.
“ Marm,” Johnson murmured, “ tell Knatchbull
I furgive him.”
* # *
At 9' o’clock the first batch was hanged.
At 9.20, the second. At 9.55, the third.
A few minutes before 9, a sweet and low volun-
tary came through the open chapel-windows, like
a zephyr’s sigh. At 9.15, it had changed to the
exquisite “Kyrie,” from Beethoven’s “Mass in
C.” At 10 o’clock, a triumphal Gloria welcomed
the rose-red spires that shot up from the East, and
drove the mist away.
PRICE WARUNG.
For Debility
USE HORSFORO'S ACID PHOSPHATE.
Dr. B. Mallam, M.R.C.S., and L.S.A., Mead-
ow Sides, Staines, says : “ I find it a most admira-
ble preparation in cases of extreme debility.’’
An excess of animal food and a partial losing
of the pores of the skin, during the winter months*
cause the system to become filled with impurities,
These are removed and the blood purified by
taking Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
A Remarkable Divorce Case.
“ That truth is stranger than fiction was never
better exemplified than in an important divorce
case in. which I figured as one of the counsel. The
Honourable Henry James Fltzroy, commonly
called the Earl of Euston, petitioned, and Kate
Walsh Smith, otherwise Fitzroy, and Countess of
Euston, responded. Mr. Charles Russell, Q.C..
Mr. Murphy, Q.C., and Mr. Lehman were counsel
for the petitioner, while Mr. Inderwick, Q.C.,
and I represented the respondent.
“ Even in the annals of that remarkable tribunal,
the Divorce. Court, I do not think a more extra-
ordinary story was ever unravelled than this case
brought to light.
“ The petitioner was the eldest son of the Duke
of Grafton, and he sued Kate Walsh Smith to
have a decree of nullity of marriage pronounced
on the ground that, at the time he went through
the ceremony of marriage with her, she was a
married woman whose husband was then living.
In the year 1870, the petitioner, then the Honour-
able Henry Eitzroy, met the respondent, who
was known by . the name of Kate Cook. ,-Sho
was alleged to be a woman of gay habits, w ho had
taken her name from a person connected with the
circus, with 'whom she had lived for a number of
years. After the petitioner had met her, he lived
with her for some time, and, eventually, on the
29th of May, 1871, they went -through the cere-
mony of marriage. The respondent gave her
name as Kate Walsh, and stated that she was a
widow. In the . certificate of the Registrar of
Marriages she was described in that way. The
friends of the petitioner learnt of his connection
with this woman some time before the ceremony
was gone through, and they were very anxious to
prevent it. The marriage took place in a parish
church at Worcester, and, at that time. Lord
Euston, who was entitled in his own right to
£lO,OOO, settled the amount upon the respondent.
Unfortunately for her, she was introduced by
some friends of his to a solicitor named Eroggatt.
“ The reader will remember that the solicitor in
question was one of the defendants in the second
Turf Eraud case, and that he was convicted.
“Eroggatt officiated as one of the trustees under
the settlement. He subsequently made away with
the money, and was tried for the larceny at the
Old Bailey, I being the prosecuting counsel. He
was convicted, and sentenced to penal servitude.
“In the certificate of marriage'the petitioner was
described as of full age. In point of fact, he was,
at the time, between 21 and 22. -The respondent
was 28 years of age. After the marriage the par-
ties lived 'together for a period of about four years,
there being no issue of the union. In 1875 they
separated, and from that year down to the time of
the trial in the Divorce Court rib communication
passed between them.
“The petitioner, who had, of course, lost caste
with his friends,', was advised to go abroad. He
went to Australia, where he obtained Government
employment. He discharged his duties in ever3 7
way creditably ■to himself, and ultimately came
back to this country. After his return circum-
stances suggested"a doubt as to whether the res-
pondent’s description of hersdf at the time of-the
njarriage, as a widow, was a, true one. Inquiries
were instituted, and they satisfied the petitioner
and his friends that, when the ceremony was gone
through, the respondent had. a husband living.
On the 6th of July, 1863, she had married a man
of the name of George. Manly Spilth. The cer-
tificate of that'marriage was discovered, and on it
the name was given as “ George M. Smith.” The
ceremony took place at St. Mungo’s Catholic
Chapel, Glasgow, and the parties were described
as follows ; George M. Smith. 127, Argyll-street,
Glasgow, a bachelor, and commercial traveller;
Kate Walsh,, spinster, of Cathedral-street, Glas-
gow. There was no question about "the! marriage.
There could be no doubt that it took place at the
date and under the circumstances mentioned.
The friends, of the petitioner had now to devote
their energies to discovering the whereabouts »of
George Manly Smith.
“It appeared that, at one penon of her career,
the respondent had been sued for the recovery ot
a sum of money in the County Court, under cir-
cumstances that made it material for her to
explain her position and what her status was. On
that occasion, it was discovered, she swore that
her husband,- Mr., George Manly Smith, had
sailed from this country in the London, the sad
history of which vessel is known to everybody.
She foundered at sea and all lives were lost.
“The advisers of the petitioner had now to find
out whether this statement was correct. On
scrutinising a list of those who had gone out in
the London, they found, sure enough, the name,
“G. M. Smith.” Fortunately, they pursued
their investigations further. It transpired that
the name of the passenger who was drowned was
George Maslin Smith, and that his widow, who
had administered to his estate after his death, was
still alive. She was, indeed, afterwards called as
a witness at the trial.
“Thus far, then, the investigations had yielded a
satisfactory result. The respondent, when inter-
rogated in the County Court, was wrong when
she asserted that her husband had been diowned
in the London. Further search now brought to
light the fact that George Manly Smith was living
in New Zealand.
‘ ‘ He was brought over to this country and was
called as a witness in the Divorce Court when the
case came on. The respondent, who was seated
next to the solicitor who instructed us, Mr.
Dutton, was pointed out to the witness, and he
at once identified her as the woman he had married
at Glasgow.
“ Matters now took a fresh turn. We who ap-
peared on behalf of the respondent alleged that
when George Manly Smith went through the cere-
mony of marriage with Kate Walsh he had a wife
actually alive. By a curious coincidence, her
maiden name was Mary Ann Smith. Her brother
was Called, and he proved that she died of cancer
on the 9th of June, 1867, having therefore lived
for four years after George Manly Smith went
through the ceremony of marriage with Kate
Walsh. In point of fact, therefore, the respondent
was not legally married until she married the
Earl of Euston. His suit was accordingly dis-
missed, and the marriage now stands. ’’—Montagu
Williams, Q.C., in “ Leaves from a Life.”
