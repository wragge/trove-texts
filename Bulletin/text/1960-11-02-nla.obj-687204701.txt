AN OLD AUSTRALIAN
This jew-lizard, also known as a “frilly” (though not the true frill-lizard), was photographed at Bringelly,
30 miles west of Sydney, and was a big one—over 18 inches long. He was quite unconcerned, and obstinately
prosed to be moved with a stick or persuaded to puff-up his throat. Of his own accord he later moved
deliberately through the grass with his head held almost vertical, surveying the landscape, then diving on insects
near the grass-roots.

NEWS FROM DARWIN
Darwin looms or wavers in the mind
as such a sleepy little town, far away
on the edge of nowhere and lost in heat
and steam, that it is impossible to
imagine anything very much ever
happening there. Possibly, in some
nearby river, a crocodile may poke its
snout up and lazily swallow a tourist
from the south; but major events —no.
Consequently it is as surprising as it
is salutary to find Douglas Lockwood’s
Fair Dinkutn (Cassell) packed and
tense with the drama of events that
went off with as loud a bang as any-
thing in Australian history and have
indeed reverberated right round the
world. During his term as correspond-
ent for the Melbourne “Herald” there
was, first, World War 11, when the
Japanese bombers came over and blew
the town to pieces; and next, there was
the final and most exciting act in the
drama of the Petrovs, when Mrs.
Petrov was rescued at the last moment
from her armed Russian guards.
These are legendary stories. Even if
we knew all about them they would
always bear repeating; but the truth is,
most people forget or don't know the
details. For instance, it is still, perhaps,
commonly believed that it was the
wharfies at Darwin who, after the
Japanese raid, dispersed with such
commendable celerity that one of them,
less than a fortnight later, was found to
have walked to Melbourne. No, says
Lockwood, it was the R.A.A.F,; and
he quotes from the official report of
Mr. Justice Lowe:—
“There was heavy damage at the
R.A.A.F. station, and most of the
airmen were shaken. The station
commander gave an order that men
should gather at a point half-a-mile
down the main road and half-a-mile
m the bush to be fed. In being
passed down the line this order was
completely distorted and reached the
men in various forms. Many simply
took to the bush, believing that they
had been ordered to do so. Some
were found at Batchelor (60 miles
away), others at Adelaide River (72
miles), one at Daly Waters (400
miles), and one even reached Mel-
bourne (2500 miles) in thirteen days.”
Lockwood saw the raid himself, and
describes it most graphically. He was,
in fact, in the post office when the siren
sounded and got out just in time: the
building was destroyed, and. later,
when he returned to try to telegraph
his story, “I was in time to bow my
head as the shattered bodies of nine
men and women with whom I had had
daily dealings were carried from their
ineffectual shelter and placed on the
tray of an open truck: Postmaster
Hurtle Bald, his wife, and daughter
Iris; the supervisor of telegraphs,
A. T. R. Halls; five telephonists; and
a postal clerk.” From a “three-inch
gutter” in his garden—the best shelter
he could find—Lockwood saw:—
....one Japanese Zero on the tail
of a P4O less than 1000 feet above
me. Spent shells from the Zero’s
machine-guns crashed on the bitu-
men in front of my house, and it
wasn’t long before the American
belched smoke and went into a dive
that ended in his death-plunge into
the harbor... .Neptuna blew-up with
a tremendous explosion ... A could
see battered lifeboats, the huge
mainmast, steel plates, rafts, spars
and funnels floating hundreds of feet
in the air atop a colossal cloud of
billowing black smoke and shooting
flame.
The Japs were over Darwin. Lock-
wood recalls, more than 50 times,
though no other raids were as severe
as those of February 19. That black
day. he says, should be “forgotten,”
except for a ceremony in remembrance
of the dead; but of course it never will
be; and he has plenty of stories of
courage—the naked gunners at the
aerodrome sprinting from their showers
to man their ack-ack guns when the
Japs returned for their second strike;
Wiikshire. Bergin and Mcßobert sail-
ing their launch around the harbor,'
under Japanese fire, to rescue survivors
from the bombed ships—to counter-
balance those of panic and muddle.
The most incredible thing about the
raid was -that, after the Allies had
suffered Pearl Harbor, we should have
allowed ourselves another at Darwin:
for at 9.35 that morning, 25 minutes
before the

CRIMES BILL HUMBUG
r T'HE Crimes Act Amendment Bill is
A an awkward piece of legislation for
Labor to swallow. It is a logical corol-
lary to Labor’s own estimate of the
objectives and activities of the Com-
munist party in official statements, but
utterly at variance with its dual con-
tentions that unionism is somehow out-
side the ambit of Labor discipline and
notice, while being at the same time
the base and core of the Labor politi-
cal structure.
Long practice has made Labor
leaders adept at carrying-out these
mental acrobatics. Still, the exercises
will become much more difficult when
a lot of the activities of Labor’s close
associates may be brought within the
ambit of the criminal law.
At present the official ruling of the
A.L.P. Federal Executive as it stands is
that the Communist party is a treason-
able conspiracy aiming to destroy the
Australian way of life in the interests
of a foreign Power.
For that reason Labor men are for-
bidden to associate with Communists
or the Communist party, or any body
that the Executive rules to be a Com-
munist organisation, under pain of
expulsion.
Occasionally stalwarts do find them-
selves expelled when association is too
open and glaring, though the party is
far more forgiving towards them than
it would be if they committed the crime
of joining or co-operating with the
Liberal party.
In unionism, though Communism is
treasonable in the Labor view, and
Labor itself once had to bring down a
bill to prevent it from sabotaging the
Australian rocket-range and achieving
what Dr. Evatt described as “the sole
purpose of defeating the Australian de-
fence policy in the interests of a foreign
Power,” Labor apparently holds that a
Communist has two identities.
As a Communist he is a traitor
engaged in subversive and even treason-
able activities, and must not be associ-
ated with by A.L.P. members; as a
unionist he is a man and a brother
engaged in the common enterprise with
Labor of doing-down the capitalist and
making the world safe for the Socialist
miHenium.
'T'HUS it comes about that in their
unionist capacity members of the
A.L.P. can associate with Communists
to their hearts’ content and join with
them in common enterprise on union
executives in forcing policies on Gov-
ernments and employers, or obey their
orders in such unions as the Water-
siders’ when they fall under the control
of Reds who openly attack Labor’s
policy on arbitration and express their
determination to overthrow the system.
It is the policy of the A.L.P. politi-
cally to accept finance from bodies con-
trolled by Communists on the ground
that the money is subscribed by the
Labor rank-and-file and not by the
Communist leaders and their minority,
who seem to be always elected to office.
More than that, the A.L.P. accepts
delegates to its annual conferences from
those unions, and, though some of them
seem to voice all the views of Com-
munism, it comforts itself with the
thought that they themselves are not
official Communists and that their
association with the friends and agents
of Moscow is not culpable because it
is within the union.
Inside the union is holy ground
where politics are unknown —unless
they affect the finances and political
interests of the Labor party.
The farce which goes on of banning
“United Front” activity would not de-
ceive a newborn infant. One glimpse
at the Miners’ Federation, the Sea-
men’s Union, the Waterside Workers’
Federation and many other big key
unions is enough to illustrate the fact
that the Labor movement is in fact a
vast United Front, indivisible, and
unable to live in its own separate parts.
IYTO quarrel can be raised against the
objectives of the Crimes Act
Amendment Bill. It is intended as a
necessary security measure, a counter-
cold-war measure.
It fills gaps in the protection of the
country in peace-time which it is logi-
cal to fill.
It provides for the punishment of
anybody who kills or attempts to kill
or do bodily harm to the Sovereign as
head of the Commonwealth, or the
heir-apparent, or levies or prepares to
levy war against the Commonwealth,
or assists an enemy in a declared or
undeclared war against the Common-
wealth, or instigates foreign invasion or
manifests by an overt act an intention
to do any act connected with these
offences.
It makes liable to life-imnr!
those who shield from ptm?shme°„H
sons committing treason bv l 1 *
attempts to overthrow thTCotSt
of the Commonwealth or a proS°l
friendly nation. It makes pfepS
ievy war against a proclaimed co t
or instigating invasion of such a co
try an indictable crime.
It protects sections of the defence
forces on or proceeding to f orelen
service abroad from the kind of thins
forces suffered from during the last
war—revelation of movements or troop-
ships to the enemy.
It makes sabotage of defence facili- f
ties and materials used or intended to
be used for any purpose relating
directly to defence legally punishable
—l5 years in jail. It deals with
treachery that endangers security.
It provides safeguards against tie
kind of leakages in Government de-
partments and elsewhere that were
revealed in the Petrov Commission,
inquiry and which the Government
found itself powerless to have punished.
It covers the field of protection against
espionage.
Not even the Communists could
object to these issues except on
seditious grounds. And they don’t.
Their refuge whenever they are
menaced by legislation is a panic- j
making shout that the bill involved is i
“an attack on the Labor movement”
and to that specious cry the leaders |
of the A.L.P. can always be counted
on to respond.
eIR GARFIELD BARWICR has
shown a reasonable willingness to
consider any grounds on which both
Labor and Communism can object.
These are only ancillary grounds-®
ambit of the method of proof agains
offenders, the invasions or alleged inva-
sions of the basic principles of
common laws and liberties of the $u

Communism even more so, is read)

that it would vote against the
reading, which means a J 0 *?.J„ n( j
the whole principle of the bdl
makes the absurd demand

redrafting—which it won t do.

COUNTING YIELDS


PLAIN ENGLISH
Sir Garfield Explains
Sir Garfield Barwick’s explanation of
the provisions of the Crimes Act which
are held to be newly outrageous excur-
sions into the law of tyrannies, out of
keeping with Australian ideas of liberty
of speech and political action, show the
critics to be much like those who
attacked the State Government’s libel
and slander legislation last year.
They have been proved ignorant of
the law as it already exists, and unable to
read the legal meanings of a bill anyway.
In most instances they have been con-
tent to follow the view originally put
forward by the Communists, who raised
most of the arguments against the bill
being voiced by Labor leaders, and even
by Liberals.
Sir Garfield Barwick has shown that
most of the objected - to principles as
they are applied to security laws in
general were actually brought into Com-
monwealth law by the Fisher Labor
Government.
Such supposed innovations by Men-
zies as the clause in the bill which makes
it permissible to introduce evidence of
character to show the purpose for which
an act of sabotage or treachery is done
is new only hs it is extended to those
particular crimes. It has been in the
British official secrets legislation for
nearly a century, and in the Australian
Crimes Act as applied to official secrets
since 1914.
It is quite obvious that a man, known
to be loyal, who in a fit of drunkenness
or pique or just out of sheer devilment
or a perverted sense of humor, destroys
or injures something connected with
defence is one thing. But a man known
to be a red-hot Communist Consistently
advocating the sabotaging of Common-
wealth defence in the interests of a
foreign Power doing the same destruction
is another.
In the latter instance, even if it cannot
be proved that he acted specifically for
the purpose of aiding an enemy and
damaging his own country, the fact of
his affiliations and his known character
as an advocate of certain policies is
surely pertinent to the case and qualifies
the nature of his crime. Therefore it is
a logical matter to be brought forward
to show whether or no he acted “for a
purpose prejudicial to the safety or
defence of Australia.”
Similarly, most of the ether objections
raised by opponents of the bill are far-
fetched, and in the case of the Com-
munists —who have a very able legal
panel always on the watch to enable
them to use or flout the provisions of
the law —disingenuous and dishonest.
They know as well as anybody that
most of the substantive provisions of the
bill represent merely an adoption by the
Commonwealth of law already in force
under State Acts or the Common Law
or a clarification of existing Common-
wealth law and a closing of gaps through
which traitors and saboteurs can creep
to safety.
Many of these provisions, as in the
case of the application of knowledge of
character and record to help prove pur-
pose, are already Commonwealth law,
when applied to other matters than
secrecy, sabotage or treachery.
The proposed law of treason has been
the law of the States, and, before them,
the colonies ever since the beginning of
settlement, and all the relevant portions
of the new treason section in the Crimes
Act are in English common law.
The expression “assist an enemy by
any means,” to which the Communists
and Labor leaders have taken shrill
exception (with a chorus of camp-
followers accepting their interpretation
and swelling the din of protest) on the
ground that it might be used to punish
critics of the Government and stifle free-
dom of speech and writing, is already
in the Commonwealth law of treason
into which it was introduced by the
Fisher Labor Government. All that is
being done is to apply it as well to acts
of treachery and sabotage which do not
reach treasonable limits.
The meaning of the phrase is clearly
established by court rulings and prece-
dents. It is decisively accepted in law
that political discussion or criticism, no
matter how wrong-headed or forceful,
is not within the ambit of this law, and
neither is industrial activity unless it can
be proved that it was generated with
traitorous intent to assist an opponent
or enemy nation or affect defence
efficiency.
On this and other sections which have
produced protest B a r w i c k has de-
veloped a logical case, and justified the
necessity for the bill, even if it may call
for a little clarity to make the intent of
it clearer. This should be done where
it can be done.
It is needful not only that an Act of
Parliament should be justified by circum-
stances and needs, but that it should be
justified in the minds of electors as far
as is possible.
Landlords, Tenants and the
Legislative Council
When the N.S. Wales Government’s bill
to extend certain tenancy provisions of
the Landlord and Tenant Act comes be-
fore the Legislative Council next week
it seems certain to be defeated. Both
the Opposition parties and seven of the
nine Labor rebel M.L.Cs. have indicated
their intention of voting against it, and
these groups between them can muster
33 votes in a House of 60.
A committee of inquiry is at present
investigating the Landlord and Tenant
Act, and its report is expected to be in
the hands of the Government early in
the New Year. The anomalies of this
much-altered and amended Act have
become so glaringly apparent that even
the Government expects the committee
will make some drastic recommendations
which will ultimately have to be em-
bodied in a new Act. But apparently
it intends to take its time in preparing
the new legislation—it ™ • '

threat is that the Government, if
thwarted on this point, will go ahead with
an early referendum on abolition of tie

the outcome of appeals to the High

ment apparently is that by opposing tie
will of the Labor Government tie
Council forfeits any right to expect a
postponement of its death-warrant. Of
course the electors to whom the death-
warrant has to be submitted for endorse-
ment may have other views.
Rejected on Principle
One of the most skilled kite-flying
manoeuvres in the recent annals of Vic-
torian politics has more or less success-
fully accomplished its purpose with the
State Government’s belated announce-
ment that it had no intention of permit-
ting part of Wilson’s Promontory to be
turned into farmlands.
The take-off was adroitly managed by
leaking the news that the Soldier Settle-
ment Commission intended to takeover
20,000 acres of the Wilson’s Promontory
National Park for civilian land-settle-
ment. Victorian National Parks Associa-
tion secretary J. Ros Garnet promptly
wrote to the press protesting against the
proposal. ,
The kite was airborne. Then tne
extent of the public reaction began J

More Universities
Lney University’s Senate has decided
ft the time has come when a third
Sversity is needed to accommodate the
'"flow of those students who so easily
s f rom secondary schools to universi-
ies—and it seems, from the high percent-
„ w hc do not complete their course,
so easily fail at the universities them-
selves. .
Ihe strain on university resources,
which is already beyond bearing and
which throws more responsibility on the
students than it should, due to the limited
uumbers of teachers and restricted accom-
i illation and facilities available, might
eased if there were a reversion to old
custom under which youths rarely
itached the Australian universities before
11.
Now it is quite common for boys to
pass the leaving-certificate too young to
iilet the university and spend another
year at school to give themselves a better
passin the leaving and better chances for
scholarships.
Any extension of the school age would,
toever, lead undoubtedly to rebellion
|the secondary schools, which are just
is overcrowded and beset by teacher-
iculty as the universities.
Another solution would be a more
severe test for admission to the uni-
versities, but this would run counter to
the inverted democracy of the age in
rtich the most earnest advocates of the
%iity of labor will go to any lengths—
®e paying fees —to see that their child-
ren do not labor except as doctors,
wyers or in some other profession that
B*s them social prestige.
Thousands of youngsters in universities
May are unfitted for professional edu-
tJtlon > and are not anxious to become
professionals.
They would be more use to the com-
ity, without losing any of their per-
®ail earning-potential, if they were sent
echnical training-schools less theoretic
more practical than the universities.

Heir d' I f lent universities suited to

hpendiri no cen tralised Government
on the votes of industrial
suburbs of the Great Wens will agree
with this idea.
Newcastle in particular has a case for
establishment of an independent uni-
versity. It has a university college
attached to the University of New South
Wales at Kensington with about 1000
students —Queensland University started
with about 100 and Sydney with even
less.
Newcastle has a fine hospital suitable
to be the teaching-hospital of a medical
school and specially equipped and condi-
tioned to deal with the problems of an
industrial community.
Also the technology of Newcastle, like
that of the N.S.W. South Coast, is an
ideal background for the engineering,
metallurgical and fuel-research sides of
university teaching.
Districts should be encouraged to take
a part in providing funds for local uni-
versities or colleges which will become
universities. Many of them are rich
enough to make a very substantial contri-
bution towards the cost of providing the
sort of university their districts need.
Especially when the big heavy-industry
corporations are involved.
At any rate, in the interests of the con-
venience of students and the restriction
of travel and living away from home,
decentralisation should be a main aim
in the foundation of new academic insti-

On the Brink
November 8 will see the leadership, or
rather command, of the United States
established for the next four years and
a President installed who, like Khrush-
chev and Mao, will enjoy almost auto-
cratic power on the executive side of his
job while he is in office.
He suffers from an inconvenience that
neither of his rivals is troubled with —
an election, and a statutory obligation
to retire at a period when dictators are
usually just getting into their proper
stride. This is what, in the main, pre-
vents him from becoming even a quali-
fied dictator except in time of war, when
his power becomes almost absolute, and
his duties and responsibilities killing, as
was proved in the case of more than
one past President. Also, there is
Congress.
The current election differs from most,
if not all, previous ones. Both candi-
dates are in their forties, and the trends
of the current age have been reversed
in that during the past half-century every
President has been over 50 when in-
augurated, and the last two, Truman
and Eisenhower, in their sixties.
General Eisenhower, who retires at
70, is the oldest President in office since
William Henry Harrison (68) who made
his brief run of six weeks in 1841.
The last and youngest of the “under
fifties” was Theodore Roosevelt, who was
only 42 when he attained office after
McKinley’s assassination in October,
1901. General Grant, the next youngest,
was 46, but he was an accident of war.
It is the first time that a Roman
Catholic candidate has had a real chance
of winning, and the first time that the
contest has partaken of the nature of
a large-scale smash-and-grab publicity-
raid, with candidates either for the Presi-
dency or the Vice-Presidency in the
millionaire class and with unlimited funds
behind them.
The Catholic aspect has always been
held to be an effective bar to election,
and the sad example of A 1 Smith a case
to prove it. But Kennedy has neither
the personality nor the old-politico air
of A 1 Smith, and he has behind him
enough block-votes moderate Labor,
Negro and youth-movements —to give
him success.
Nixon naturally suffers from the fall
in the reputation of the United States
abroad. Under Republican rule this has
sagged sadly with the disappearance of
Dulles and through world realisation of
the failure of United States diplomacy
and its methods and the resurgence of
the Continental European Powers, which
were beaten into the earth by the war,
and of Japan.
At the same time, even though a
powerful independent press, including
the “New York Times,” has turned over
to Kennedy, the fight will not be won
till the results are known. As shown in
Truman’s campaign of 1948, when the
pollsters proclaimed him in advance
easily defeated, a surprise silent vote is
possible.
This is more so because, as in other
countries, politics have ceased to throw
up issues calculated to raise emotions
to fever-heat, other than those dealing
with foreign politics and defence.
On these issues the outlook is and
has to be national, and so now, for that
matter, is the view of the Negro issue,
on which the Republicans in recent years
have paradoxically been at a disad-
vantage, seeing that Lincoln was the
first of their Presidents.
For the rest, it is exceedingly difficult
to disentangle the differences between
the policies of the candidates who seem
to have been engaged in an outbidding
contest whenever an opponent puts for-
ward something that appears to have
electoral appeal.
In the fight the Republicans, the
conservative side by tradition, have been
just as forthcoming as the Democrats
who, in President Truman’s day, veered
from the extreme do-gooder Leftism of
Franklin Roosevelt’s later policy towards
Republicanism. n_
One thing is certain. The Kremlin,
which some time ago was licking its lips
at the prospect of having a Democratic
regime in office, even more than a Re-
publican President with a Democratic
Congressional majority to embarrass his
operations, will find little comfort which-
ever way the vote moves.
If anything, while more co-operative
in respect of negotiation, Kennedy is
tougher in adherence to the Monroe
doctrine in Cuba and opposition to Com-
munism than Nixon, and more clear-cut
in determination to negotiate at the sum-
mit only from strength with a power-
fully economic and military West behind
the negotiation.
Whichever way the vote goes the next
four years will be an anxious testing-
time for United States policies.

That argumentative girl-friend who
was ordered out of her boy-friend’s
car but wouldn’t budge (B. 19 /10 / ’6O)
reminds me . . . Regularly every even-
ing three youths and their girls make a
debating-club of a big black bomb parked
near a milk-bar in Burwood Road, Bur-
wood (Sydney), arguing, one can’t fail
to hear above the tinny wail of a
transistor-radio, mostly about stars and
pitchers and platters. When I approached
the other night the car’s headlights were
flicking on and off. As I passed the
vehicle the door burst open and a husky
side-levered youth ejected a resisting and
shrieking blue-jeaned doll onto the pave-
ment at my feet. As she scrambled up
ungracefully but physically unhurt, the
youth yelled, above derisive cat-calls:
“An’ when you promise to stop flattenin’

BACK TO GOLD
“A new gold-rush began in London with
the price of gold soaring to over 40 do tars
a fine ounce, as against the "official 35 dollars
paid in the U.S.”
I’ve never been a one to hold
A very large reserve of gold;
It always seemed to me
That what l had was better spent
On things like wine and food, and rent
And packages of tea;
Nor did I trouble to retain
Even my father’s watch and chain.
In this I was supported by
The leaders of society,
Who thought it was beneath-
Their dignity to make a show
Of gold, where notes or cheques would
do,
Except for stopping teeth ;
But now they’re on another tack —
The golden rule of gold is back.
So throw that crockery away
And bring the golden vase and tray,
The golden forks and spoons . . .
But even while I concentrate
On services of golden plate
That shine like harvest moons
I'm feeling just a little sad —
I rather liked those meals I had.

getting from slaughterhouse to custom-
wrapped package? Meat, even if of top-
class quality, is as tough as old cow if it’s

too many expensive butchers work on the
get-rid-quick principle rather than hang
the meat for at least seven days after
delivery. My informant happens to be

For the benefit of any long - suffering

pin applied with vigor for at least five
minutes (to the steak, not the butcher)
is an excellent tenderiser: and if then
left at room-temperature for some hours
before cooking, with a good sprinkle of
claret, the meat should be a lot more

Comes our morning departure and before

whether we had that morning luxuriated

allSfn of th e Boer,
' C l S , Cendant ; yet there
memorials in
plenty, and no permanent
tributes to the sacrifices of the
fighting Aussies in the East. It
would be interesting to know
the reasons.
Tf it is a matter of expense,
there is surely a lack of
understanding here.
Between Sydney and Albury,
in the length of the Hume
Highway, I can recall only one
statue erected in memory of
the tribulations and the tenaci-
ties of the men who hammered
this vast and difficult country
into the birth-place of a nation ;
and that is the poor and rela-
tively insignificant representa-
tion of the Dog on the Tucker-
box on the Sydney side of
Gundagai.
The cost could not have been
great, the conception was a
limited one, but in my experi-
ence the majority of the people
who pass it are con-
scious of its presence
and what it represents,
and a good proportion
of the cars —especially
the cars carrying child-
ren —stop for a closer
examination.
It never was “nine
mile from Gundagai,”
as it should have been ;
it used to be about
seven miles out and is
now nearer five; but
what’s the difference?
’Twas there that Nobby
broke his yoke, poked
out the leader’s eye;
and for a moment you
can experience the fight-
ing, indomitable spirit
of the pioneer teamster
who owes his continued
existence to art, to a
sympathetic understand-
ing, and a wide dissemi-
nation of its image.
What should be con-
sidered here as well is
that quite a large
number of people have made a
ponderable amount of money
because of the single factor that
the statue exists. There are
Tucker box Cafes, there are the
makers and sellers of photo-
graphs, there are the people
who, having stopped, make pur-
chases of refreshment, or film.
Over the years this trading has
more than paid the cost of the
statue ; the town of Gundagai
may not have been conscious
of the additional expenditure ;
but it has existed.
~\T OT l° n g ago, sculptor Lyall
Randolph, having tried un-
successfully to sell the idea to
Waverley Council, erected two
mermaids on a rock at Bondi
Beach.
The venture was short-lived ;
it fell victim in part to the
efforts of certain vandals \ but
before then it certainly attracted
visitors, and these in an off-
season. On several days there
were more people standing on
the cliffs admiring the statues
than there were on the rest of
the beach.
Additionally, television-films
were made ; and I am told that
the return from these, includ-
ing their sales overseas, brought
in more money than the statues
“Well, put on a Western—the guns scare the
life out of him!”
would have cost in the first
place.
The point I want to make is
that quite apart from their
value as works of art —and
Australia is remarkably defici-
ent in public works of art —
these were an acquisition of
monetary value, and so is any
major art-work.
The most recent of statues
I have seen is the representa-
tion of the canecutter which
enhances the beautiful park by
the river at Innisfail, in North
Queensland, and adds no little
to the stature of the Italian
community responsible for its
erection,
HThe gateway to Australia is
through the magnificent
x passage of Sydney Heads, and
facing the heads, almost in’mid-
channel, is a collection of rocks
which is the place, above all
others, at which to make an
Australian statement to the
visiting world,
And if Australia owes much
to its graziers—and it does—
the graziers surely owe a little
to the country. What a won-
derful gesture it would be, how
securely they could make their
justifiable claim to a substan-
tial proportion of credit for
the Australian achievement if,
at a cost that would average
no more than the fiver which,
at some time or other, just
about every one of them tosses
on a Sydney bar, they built a
statue here symbolising the
greatness of their industry. I
can visualise a mighty eques-
trian bronze of drovers with

deciding factor in Calare. In a straight-
out fight at the general election Liberal
John Howse won by 22,557 to Labor-
candidate Rygate’s 16,296. This time the
Government vote will be split between
W. Meares (Lib.) and J. England
(Country party), which means that L.
Serisier (A.L.P.) will be certain to lead
on primaries. After the handful of votes
that J. Phillips (Republican) can expect
have been distributed, the split-up of
D.L.P. candidate R. Proust’s prefs. will
determine whether England or Meares
passes into the final round. D.L.P. sup-
porters are talking in terms of 4000-5000
votes, but on State election figures 2000
would be a good score.

The Frome by-election for the S.A.
Assembly will also be held on Saturday.
It's a four-cornered contest in which
D.L.P. preferences will again be signifi-
cant. Frome covers a huge area in the
north of the State but has fewer than
6000 electors on the roll. Last year the
late Opposition-leader Mick O’Halloran
retained it by a small majority against
the same two men his successor as A.L.P.
candidate will be facing on Saturday.
Premier Playford has been campaigning
hard in Frome and is hopeful of wresting
the seat from Labor. Candidates: T. M.
Casey (A.L.P.), M. E. Hams (Lib.), M. P.
Hoare (D.L.P.) and W. E. Hanna (Ind.).

From the letter-column of Sydney
“Herald”:
A New Anthem
Sir, —Some Labor politicians have sug-
gested that “Advance Australia Fair” should
be played in conjunction with the national
anthem at all public functions.
In view of the A.C.T.U.’s demand for
a £2 ss. increase in the weekly wage,
and Labor’s flagrant disregard of the
country’s economic situation, I suggest
as a compromise a new anthem combining
both, and simply named “God Save
Australia.”

In seeking to restrict recruitment of

the high-sounding High Council of Com-

desirable restriction of the number of

moved because it thinks pay rates in the
service, both junior and adult, are too
low compared with outside jobs—dis-
regarding, of course, the security shelter
offered by the Public Service Act and the
cloying conditions of most public-service
employment. The Public Service Board,
instead of welcoming a move which
would really start to reduce the ranks of
bureaucrats, feels the High Council is
introducing “industrial picket-line tac-

with Professor Peter Brian Medawar, of
London), Sir Macfarlane Burnet,
Director of Melbourne’s Walter and
Eliza Hall Institute, has had a brilliant
scientific career. Hailing originally from
Traralgon (Vic.) and educated at Geelong
College and Melbourne University, he
was resident-pathologist at the Royal
Melbourne Hospital, 1923-24, later went
overseas for research, was Beit Fellow
at the Lister Institute, London, 1926-27,
and in 1932 started his notable work on
the cultivation of viruses. He was assis-
tant-director of the Walter and Eliza
Hall Institute, 1928-31, and again from
1934 to 1944, when he became Director
and also Professor of Experimental
Medicine at Melbourne Uni. He has
been chairman of the National Radiation
Advisory Committee since 1957, was
knighted in 1951, and admitted to the

“N.G.”: Veterinarian and scientist
Dr. J. F. Filmer, who had completed 22
years as Director of the Animal Re-
search Division of the New Zealand
Department of Agriculture before ,he
retired early last month, reversed the
usual order of Tasman crossings by going to
Maoriland from Australia. He crossed in 1938,
by when he had already distinguished himself
VET. IN NEW ZEALAND
in veterinary and other research. A Victorian,
born at Tatura in 1895 and trained at Mel-
bourne Veterinary School, he graduated B.V.Sc.
in 1916 and went overseas as a veterinary
officer with the Ist A.I.F. in Greece and
Salonika.
Discharged in 1919 as a captain, he was a
vet. at Katanning (W.A.) till 1925, when he.
joined Westralia’s Department of Agriculture
as a senior veterinary-surgeon. In 1936 he
moved to Victoria as veterinary research-officer
to the Western District Research Association
at Camperdown.
His first major research in Australia con-
cerned a disease affecting sheep and cattle
around Denmark (W.A.) and similar to “bush-
sickness” in New Zealand and “coast-disease”
in South Australia. Filmer and his associate,
E. J. Underwood, finally showed that cobalt-
deficiency was the trouble, and for a thesis
on this the Melbourne University gave Filmer
the degree of Doctor of Veterinary Science
shortly after he joined the Wallaceville
Veterinary Laboratory (N.Z.) in 1938.
Within a month of his arrival in N.Z. he
was appointed Director of a newly formed
Animal Research Division of the department,
with investigation of facial eczema as his first
responsibility. The division started with the
Wallaceville station well established in the
study of disease and with a new station at

“R.R.D.”: Follow-up to last week’s
par. about Russell Drysdale was a visit
to The Bulletin office by the artist's
father, G. R. Drysdale, of Point Piper
(Sydney). Born in Australia and
schooled in England, Drysdale was
gazetted to the Black Watch before
War I and came back here permanently
in 1923. His tales of old redcoated days
at Sandhurst Field - Marshal Mont-
gomery was a senior in his company there
—showed that things then were not so
different from the drabber 1920’5. Even
then adjutants came down the line with
their noses in the air “as if communing
in silent scorn with some invisible
Coldstream deity above the clouds,”
but with quite as sharp an eye for
the smallest flaw of dress or bearing
as “Boy” Browning, the Grenadier,
had 20 years later. Even then the drill-
sergeants’ shrill abuse was as politely
prefaced by “Mister” —whatever other
handle a cadet might have to his name —
and was equally slanderous. But here the
prize can go to the exasperated staff-
sergeant who was drilling a squad
which included the Duke of Gloucester
(then Prince Henry), and disapproved
of H.R.H.’s “idle slope.” “Mr. Prince
’Enry, sir,” he bellowed, “if I was your
father, sir, I’d ...” A long pause came
here, because the traditional gambit was
“I’d shoot meself, sir,” but this sounded
too much like lese-majesty. The parade
could almost hear the loyal thoughts
stirring through the “drill-pig’s” mind:
“I’d habdicate, sir!”

“Gravelsnatcher”: A feature of our
desert trees is that practically all the
rain that falls on foliage or branch finds
its way down the trunk. That applies
in part to most of our native trees, since
even those in areas of heavy winter rains
must provide for a long dry summer —
witness the way eucalypts turn their
leaves edge-on to the sun on a hot day.
Similarly, during rain you’ll see streams
coursing down the trunks of big gums,
and it’s a fair bet that much of it follows
on down the roots and deep into the
subsoil, where it’s safer from evaporation.
In the desert-mulgas this trend is excep-
tionally evident; it’s as though every leaf,
twig, branchlet was shaped and directed
so that water running off it must be
channelled to the trunk. Thus, a big
proportion of every desert shower is
carried into the subsoil at spots where
the trees’ shade reduces evaporation, and
where they can use a maximum of it.

hounds tearing in full -cry across frosty
uplands, only to be checked into dis-
mal whining and anxious casting hither
and yon by a foxy strategy that led them
into a sheltered gully in which the frost
had bitten more deeply. But if Reynard’s
passing-by were recent the older and
more experienced dogs would soon be
on the quarry’s trail again.

Driving her rattling wagonette,
Her horses wearing hats.

Her face stern as the sphinx—

And, oh, no passing winks.
We’d hear her coming miles away

As her excuse she made.
You might have thought her wagonette
Lopsided or 'would break,
The way it leaned when up she’d get
And give the reins a shake.
Each week she came, always the same,
Way down from Bungo Flats,
Driving her bays adown the days,
With daisies in their hats.

of getting wet, and it’s also very hard
to recognise as a nest. Cayley in What
Bird Is that ? says the dabchick anchors
its nest to reeds, and possibly this is so
in the eastern States ; but the ones I’ve
seen in W.A. have been free-floating and
could drift with the wind, though always
sited in a bay so shaped that none of
the normal winds would drive the raft
out to the open swamp. The lack of
secrecy has its advantages. The sitting
bird has an open getaway into the water ;
there's always a handy supply of fresh
nesting-material; and the nest merges so
well with the duckweed around it and
the grasses growing along the swamp-
edge a few feet away that you might
walk quite close and not notice it. From
"I'm sure you'll find it a home from home."
the number of young dabchicks on the
swamp this system of nesting evidently
fulfils all Nature’s requirements.

Southern Hemisphere. The 250 ft. der-
rick will erect the 210 ft.-diameter para-
bolic dish which will pick-up radio-waves
from outer space, generated by heat and
electrical disturbances among the stars
and galaxies—and by instruments of
American and other space-probes from
the earth. The scientists who man the
telescope 24 hours a day, seven days a

work in ship’s shifts. They’ll need black-

“Harbel”: Nobody likes wearing rub-

them. Not so the new bloke ; he whinged
all day ; then, just to make him really
happy, he discovered just before knock-
off he’d lost three-quid through a hole
in his pants’-pocket. Search failed to
find the missing fiddlies,- and it looked as
if they had dropped into the wet con-
crete and were being preserved for pos-
terity. Then, as their owner peevishly
flung his dragged-off gumboots across
the hut, the missing notes fluttered out of
one of them. The maligned boots had
done for him what no other trilbies could
have done: coming up well over the
bottoms of his trouser-legs, they had
caught the falling flags.

days I was puzzled by the sudden interest
shown these two by their pair of babies
of last year. On the fifth day I discovered
the closed door and learned the reason
for the attention shown them-their
offspring had reversed the procedure and
were feeding them through the bars of
the cage. Must have done a good job,
too, for when I pinned the door W

Brick E’: A few years back, before
Japanese floor-tiles collared the market,
Australian-made Moravian tiles were the

the tiles had been laid ; Moravians were
supplied loose and laid individually, and
“Thank you, no, they cause lung-cancer !”
as they measured 2in. by lin., which
meant that the average bathroom took
2,500 tiles, most builders’-supply mer-
chants didn’t relish the counting involved
for a sale worth about £ll. So most of
’em guessed, and mistakes, if any, were
invariably on the right side —well, busi-
ness is business. But that didn’t mollify
tilers, whose whole job was ruined if
there were not sufficient tiles to com-
plete it in one operation. That was why
we always patronised a merchant whose
quantities consistently worked out exact,
almost to the tile. No, he didn’t count

“And here’s a spin towards your
bazaar on Saturday,” said Uncle
Alf, as he extracted the note from his
wallet. “Reminds me of a couple of
years ago when we had to raise £2OOO
for the hospital. It had been a real bad
year , we’d built and paid for a swim-
ming-pool for the orphanage and a new
wing for the rectory, as well as the usual
annual appeals for the Red Cross and
C.W.A. We’d been digging pretty deep
in our pockets, and, besides that, the crops
hadn’t been doing too well, because there
ourselves responsible for the raising of
the £2OOO for the hospital by means of
a hospital-fete. It was to be on the
eighteenth of the next month, and we
would make all the arrangements our-
selves. Were the women mad, too ; it
was the first time they hadn’t been in-
vited to help! Everyone was asking what
sideshows we were having, and how
would we men provide afternoon-tea
ourselves. Well, the eighteenth finally
came, and in the morning we saw the
little rainmaking-plane land on one of
Joe Bright’s paddocks. By eleven-o’clock
they were in the air again, and I don’t
know how they did it, but by lunch-time
it was raining cats and dogs. ‘Send her
down, Hughie,’ I said, and Hughie cer-
tainly responded. ‘What a shame about
the fete!’ my wife said. Half-an-houi
later, Doctor Chalmers rang - up, and
asked would we postpone the fete to the
next week, because it was impossible to
have anything in this rain. ‘Do you
think we’ve had an inch yet, Doctor?’ I
said, just to make sure. ‘Yes, Alf, I'd
say it was getting on for two.’ ‘That's
0.k., Doctor, I just wanted to make sure,
because we’ve insured the fete against
rain, and if there’s an inch, we’ll collect
the two-thousand-pounds’ insurance.’

had been no lain for a long while. In
fact, Joe Bright had been making inquiries
about having a rainmaking - team up
from Sydney to see what they could do.
I saw Joe in the pub, and asked him
when they were coming. ‘Next month,’
he said ; 'that’s when the right clouds
ought to be around. These jokers are
coming up on the eighteenth, and will
try for rain then, because they have to
be somewhere else the next day.’ I
thought about this for a while, and then

THE MARKET RALLY
A fter wearing a shattered
appearance for several
days, following nearly a fort-
night of decline and fall, there
was a widespread rally in the
sharemarkets throughout Aus-
tralia on Wednesday of last
week. There was a further
firming movement on the next
day.
The movement was so general
that it almost appeared that in-
stitutional buying had come
back into the market after
several days of absence. Fixed
trusts and the like have such
wide portfolios that vigorous
buying by them would have an
all-over influence on the
market. That is what was
suggested by the rally in prices
towards the middle and end of
last week.
Though the movement was
general, with fair turnover, the
rise, overall, was moderate.
There were some spectacular
recoveries, as in Newbold Re-
fractories (up from 18s. 3d. to
20s. 9d.), but the general trend
was an upward one of about
1 p.c. on the low level reached
on October 25. By comparison,
the fall between September 16
and October 25 had been nearly
12 p.c.
After this rally (which flat-
tened a little on Friday), or any
number of rallies, there will still
be some shares that are too high
and others that are too low. It
is up to the investor to make
his pick, and at present prices
there are many stocks which
are at their lowest levels for
nearly 12 months.
What the investor should
keep closely in mind is the fact
that for two years at least the
sharemarket has been living on
itself, not on income, present
or immediate, from the stocks
dealt in.
Share prices have gone up
away beyond any index of pro-
duction or profit-earning in
this country, and share-buyers
have quite openly said that they
were buying for capital-gains,
not for income. But when that
attitude becomes general the
tendency is for share prices to
soar into the realms of fantasy
until a large body of investors
decide to realise their capital-
gains and put their money
somewhere else. At that point
the yield, present and prospec-
tive, offered by equity shares
becomes of urgent importance
to those holding investment
shares.
For too long equity yields
“I Want my money back —IT FAILED!”
have been too low—2 p.c. (or
less) up to 4 p.c. fpr front-line
ord. shares, compared with 5
p.c. from Commonwealth
bonds and up to 7 p.c. to 9 p.c.
from reasonably backed un-
secured notes.
The investor can take it for
granted that much more regard
will be paid in the future to
present earning-power and im-
dories represented°by * «pii ty
has Bone
There are economic difficul-
ties ahead of Australia largely
based on excessive wage-costs
entering the economy at a time
of falling world prices. In this
we are the odd-man-out in in-
ternational trade. We are short
of capital, and we can’t create
it by credit-manipulation. It
has to come from increased
productivity and a wider
margin of saving over con-
sumer-spending. .
The policy of the Federal
Treasury has not been sym-
pathetic to the problems of
industry under inflation, dis-
regarding as it does the never-
ceasing capital-erosion. And
the various wage-fixing authori-
ties seem almost to regard our
export trade as a foreign affair
when it comes to the matter
of costs in relation to export
prices.
The private investor should
henceforth buy ordinary indus-
trial shares only on a careful
analysis of company accounts
an d a study of general econo-
conditions. He should be
able to see some thing in the
affairs of the company itself
that attracts him. It is no
longer advisable to buy merely
on the “tone” of the market.

Gibsonvale district is a high-
cost deep-lead mining area,
and assuming that the values
of 151 b. to 251 b. of which the

realised, mining and treatment
costs would still be (ordinarily)
relatively high in this area.
Hence the Vibro-Scalper

these are quite beyond The

As far as is known, after investi-

similar to Gibsonvale area, is using
anything approaching these modern
methods, particularly in regard to
low production costs and the high
output which can be brought about
by volume of materia, mined.
So no wonder the prospectus,
on its front cover, introduces
the proposition as a “RevoJu-

natures. The incoming part-
ner has interests all over the
world, being one of the two
very large groups controlling
the goldmines in the Trans-
vaal and Orange Free State,
some of which are the world’s
lowest-cost producers of
uranium-oxide. It has substan-
tial holdings in piatinum-min-
ing and the Rhodesian copper-
belt. It has other interests in
Canada, the United States and
Mexico.
In Australia the Gold Fields
Group has a substantial share-
holding in, and administrative
control of, Lake View and Star
(W.A.); Lake GeorgQ Mining
Corp. (N.S.W.); Gold Fields
Australian Development, Ltd.
(Mt. Ida, W.A.); and, through
New Consolidated Goldfields
(Aust.), is engaged directly in
mineral exploration in Aus-
tralia.
N.C.G. (Aust.) and Com-
monwealth Mining will co-
operate in prospecting and test-
ing of mining properties in
Australia, enabling wider scope
for C.M.1., and the £1,750,000
of new capital introduced into
C.M.I. will enable bigger in-
vestment in mining enterprises
and proportionately, lower
operating costs. The world-
wide technical resources of the
Gold Fields Group were a
factor in persuading C.M.I.
directors (of»which Julius
Kruttschnitt, of Mt. Isa, is
chairman) to recommend the
tie-up.
Commonwealth Mining In-
vestments’ own interests were
more profitable last year. Non-
contributors to dividend-income
were Western Titanium (W.A.),
Eclipse Gold Mines (W.A.) and
Wyong Minerals (titanium-
mining at Wyong, N.S.W.).
Low prices for ilmenite and
rutile are mainly responsible
for the lean times being faced
by two of these cos. But the
general portfolio of investments
held by C.M.I. (including some
nice parcels of scrip in Mt. Isa,
the Barrier mines, Placer and
Mt. Lyell) brought in £8756
more at £88,702 ; net profit
was up £9334 at £73,929, and
equal to 6. Id. (against 5.3 d.)
per stock-unit. Dividends for
the year totalled 6d. per stock-
unit (against 5d.).
The investment portfolio was
in the books at £1,449,939.
Cash and other tangibles
totalled £57,187, against liabili-
ties of £85,793.
The share portfolio had a
market-value of £383,498 in
excess of book-value on June
30, equal to 2s. 7d. per stock-
unit. Of the share invest-
ments, 83jr p.c. was in div.-
paying stocks, compared with
82 p.c. a year previously. On
the div.-paying portion of the
portfolio the gross return on
capital invested was 7.4 p.c.,
compared with 7.1 p.c. previous
year.
Prospecting during the year
was extensive, but only one
prospect merited a further look,
which is proceeding.
The Gold Fields Group
appear to be keenly interested
in their new move in Australia.
Since the proposed acquisition
of shares in C.M.I. was an-
nounced three directors —G. G.
Potier, R. H. A. Neuschild and
J. D. McCall —have visited Aus-
tralia to look things over.
Though metal prices for the
present are depressed, especi-
ally in the titanium field (in
which C.M.I. has substantial
holdings), it seems that group-
ing and diversifying of
interests with a big overseas
concern should in the long-
run produce new discoveries
and promote development of
known mineral deposits that
will be profitable to C.M.I.
shareholders. For those who
want an interest in something
of a mining-share “trust,” the
10s. shares at 9s. provide a
present income of over 5 p.c.
and an interest in future
developments that could some
day be more exciting than
it is right now.
Independent Retailers
HThe difficulties of the modest,
■*- independent business, albeit
prosperous and efficient, in to-
day’s engulfing circumstances,
is illustrated wryly in the case
of Georges, Ltd., of Collins
Street, Melbourne, an admir-
able, exclusive shop and reputed
to be the only sizeable depart-
ment store in the southern
world catering exclusively for
women.
In 1956 the directors suc-
cessfully resisted a bid by K.
O. Gieger with a bonus-issue ;
but on September 21, when
Georges’ lOs.-shares were
quoted at 355., Cox Bros.
(Aust.), Ltd., offered ,555. cash,
Or six Cox Bros. ss. shares
(now at 10s. each).
Georges’ directors, after a
delay in which the relative
merits of the companies were
investigated by their own
accountants, rejected the bids
and announced instead a bonus-
issue of one-for-two held on
October 19, to be followed by
a split into 55.-shares.
Cox’s reply was an announce-
ment that the company would
approach the shareholders
direct; it pointed - out that
Georges’ directors had made
no reference to the 555. cash-
offer.
The following day A. J.
George, Georges’ managing-
director, announced that he was
accepting Cox Bros.’ offer be-
cause he thought it undesirable
to subject the business to an-
other bonus-issue, that the offer
was good, and that sooner or
later, “under the modern,
economic set-up,” it was in-
evitable Georges would be
taken-over by one of the major
retail-trading groups.
Cox Bros, has since amended
its offer to 18s. 4d. cash or two
Cox Bros. f.-p. shares for each
of the split-up ss. shares in
Georges (ex bonus).
No takeovers have been
attempted against two other
superior Melbourne depart-
ment-stores, Ball and Welch
and Buckley and Nunn. Both
are expanding Ball’s into
booming Frankston and Buck-
ley’s in the main shopping-area.
Both give their shareholders a
10-per cent, discount, an effec-
tive binder to the management.
War bur ton, Franki
TThe group results shown by
Warburton, Franki, Ltd.,
for the year to June 30
were disappointing, in view of
the fact that the £101,618 net
profit (up £17,792) included
a capital profit of £25,662
from disposal of premises, and
excluded a stock write-down
of £35,000, which, an accumu-
lation of past years, was
charged direct to reserves.
Taxation provision was

,tc of this, his last play

tytful measure.

ito have come from the

ilirs who are out to tear
sis up in search of oil; of

Kmies—literally, in a kind

ii’s invention so far trans-
it this specific situation
•I now we are readier to
ethe play as an airy allegory
to conflict between those
•would destroy life for a
® and those who affirm it
: itself —a conflict that is
% much with us.
®re is no dry didacticism
in all this; the characters are
taken lyrically beyond mere
symbolism: they live in their
own right, and their actions,
even those of the “enemy”,
are charged with a kind of
poetic joy.
“Poor darling is in agony. He cant make up his mind
whether to call it ‘Bilateral Paradox or ‘Multilinear
Deceleration .’”
With its continual and in-
genious mingling of elements,
the play admits of many more
interpretive possibilities than
the Genesians, under James
Lang’s direction, have realised
for us; but when allowance is
made for their small stage in
relation to the enormous cast
of the play—about 40 charac-
ters, many of them onstage at
once —they have given us
more than enough to be going
on with.
The actors as a group have
been rightly criticised for itali-
cising too many of Giraudoux’s
most telling lines. This was
especially noticeable in the
Lewis Carrollish tea-party in
the Madwoman’s cellar, and
again in the trial-scene. Both
scenes are a trifle overwritten
to begin with, and should be
taken more quickly. In
general, however, the key pas-
sages stood up strongly.
If the play belongs to the
Madwoman —an exquisitely
crazy and tender creation—
this production belongs to
Mary Mackay for her playing
of that role. Here was acting
of a strength, intelligence and
fidelity that did much to hold
the production together and
made even her occasional first-
night slips of memory seem
unimportant.
Barry Morrison delightfully
rendered the sewerman’s ac-
count of daily life below
ground; Harold Fraser was
excellent in the rag-picker’s
two bursts of eloquence; Ken
Imison, John O’Hanlon and
Ron Tunstall gave edge and
point to three admirable
character-sketches.

“Visit to a Small Planet”
No publicity-man could fail
to extract, for advance blurb
purposes, from this Gore Vidal
comedy an allegory of the cold
war, a satire on the Great
American Way of Life from
adolescent romance to mili-
taristic meddling at the Penta-
gon, etc. ; and that is what
many of us who are sometimes
attracted by the publicity
broadsheets went to the Mel-
bourne Union Theatre expect-
ing. But despite the outpour-
ings of the P.R. men, the pieee
can hardly be taken seriously
as a metaphor of the times.
Vidal —best known for his
novels and film-scripts; this is
his first play—simply has not
the equipment for penetrating
contemporary satire. Instead
of using his own experiences
and insights, he chooses from
Hollywood images of the
world: his teenagers are im-
possibly saccharine ; his Army
general is too incompetent to
be relevant; his housewife with
mental horizons stretching no
further than the front-gate is
too simple-minded and com-
placent for anything but a
comic-strip ; and his TV news-
analyst is too muddle-headed
and grotesquely sentimental,
even for U.S. screens. His
visitor from outer space,
though, has at least the virtue
of being unlike any other
gentleman from those regions
that the present writer can
recall having encountered.
By showing how a house-
hold and its friends react to
this eccentric and strife-loving
visitor —who almost succeeds
in setting-off a third world war
in an attempt to keep himself
amused while on earth—Vidal
clearly hoped to be able to let
us into the secrets of our
planet’s present “state of
chassis.” The best one can say
of the results is that they make
us laugh pretty often —probably
more often than Vidal intended.
The best one can say of
William Sterling’s generally
stilted production is that the
well-disciplined, if not over-
imaginative, cast missed not a
line ; that every cue and special
“effect” was right on time. And
what with space-ships landing
and departing, sundry ominous
explosions on and off stage,

Heinze and Siki
Bela Siki, the Hungarian
pianist now doing his second
Australian tour, was soloist at
the A.B.C.’s subscription-con-
cert at Sydney Town Hall last
Saturday night in Beethoven’s
Fifth Concerto (the “Em-
peror”). The orchestral col-
laboration in the extended
opening movement failed to
measure-up to the punch and
crispness imparted to it by the
pianist, whose eagerness to
reveal all its aggressive forth-
rightness and rhythmic vigor
was clearly manifest.
Executant and orchestra
began to think more along the
same lines in the beautiful
hymn-like adagio. Here Siki
demonstrated, along with his
ability to sustain superb canta-
“Well! You asked me what my father calls me!”
bile- like tone, a warm expres-
siveness, with bell-like clarity
accorded the descending triplets
and the banks of chromatically
ascending trills. He ended the
delicate transitional passage
with an explosive chord that
seemed to galvanise the
orchestra, for from then till the
close it played with dynamism
and precision to make this
great movement a real tour de
force.
The symphony was Sibelius’s
Seventh. The very antithesis
of the Fourth, through which
the bleak northern winds moan,
the one-movement Seventh
harks back to the restraint of
traditional classicism with
warm and vital music and
harmonies of a richness of
color unmatched in any other
symphony written in this cen-
tury. Sir Bernard Heinze
worked-over the orchestra with
admirable zeal to bring out
these colors in glowing vivid-
ness and elsewhere achieved a
near-Olympian grandeur.
The Suite from Stravinsky’s
“Firebird” ballet was reason-
ably strong in imagery, the best
playing going into the darkly
menacing episodes and the
turmoil of the demoniac sec-
tion, with its brusque leaps and
barbaric rhythms. At the other
end of the emotional gamut,
in the Round Dance of the
Princesses, Heinze was equally
authoritative where extreme
tenderness and melodic beauty
were called for.
The concert opened with an
engagingly limpid account of
Alexander Siloti’s transcription
for strings, woodwinds and
organ of Vivaldi’s Concerto
Grosso in D Minor.

Claremont Quartet
It was as a quintet—with
Lois Simpson supplying the
extra ’cello-voice that this
visiting American ensemble,
at its last concert, did the best
work of its Sydney season.
The quintet was the refulgent
C Major of Schubert, that
spacious product of the last
year of his life and one of the
greatest of all quintets.
Though in a major key like
the earlier “Trout” Quintet,
this work has none of the
geniality and ebullience of the
one based on his famous song ;
it is all dark tones, expressive
of intense tragedy. The players
met the challenge of its pro-
fundity with devoted attention
to detail, technical assurance
and a satisfying attempt to
capture the sublime spirit of
the slow movement. Here the
songful melancholy was dotted
by a pizzicati accompaniment

decided to paint the sun as a

advantage. It is a white swirl

“Two-way Stretch”
Dovetailing some sparkling
satire into a plot of consider-
able ingenuity, the makers of
this British comedy have given
Peter Sellers barrowloads of
opportunity to exercise the par-
ticular brand of humor that
has rocketed him into the top
flight of English comedians.
Satirical shafts by the dozen
are loosed in the opening
sequences at the woolly-minded
sentimentalists who insist on
carrying prison-reform to the
point where prisons become
homes-from-home and the con-
victs pampered pets allowed to
do much as they please in the

Liquid assets amounted to £104,517,075
(up £15,015,672). The Reserve Bank’s
credit-tightening was reflected in the
£5,833,000 rise in the statutory reserve-
deposit account (to £31,733,000).
Advances increased by £3,427,550 to
£117,901,285. Shares in other cos. were
£528,118 higher, representing £424,000
paid on June 30, 1960, for 1,696,000 ss.

(sponsored by Development Finance
Corp.).
The savings-bank continued to expand.
During the year deposits, bills payable,
etc., rose by £10,748,000 to £45,828,000.
Australian Government securities now
stand at £25,826,000 (up £7,139,000), and
local and semi-Governmental authorities’
securities at £7,061,000.
In the first four years the C.B.S.
Savings Bank, Ltd., approved £8,500,000
housing-loans. Total assets at balance-
date amounted to £47,103,096 (up
£10,859,331).
On the parent figures, the liquidity
ratio works-out a shade under 32.7 p.c.,
disregarding £31.7 million in statutory
deposits. The ratio of advances to
deposits was almost 55 p.c.
The overall picture is of guarded ex-
pansion and higher liquidity. The bank’s
share of total trading-banks’ advances
and discounts at June 30, 1960, was
11.6 p.c. (11.9 p.c. in 1959).
Book-values of fixed assets are con-
servative. Net tangible asset - backing
works out at £25 Os. 2d. for each £25

Finance Corp. of Australia, Ltd.
“~D apid but sound expansion was
achieved during the year.” Total
outstandings rose by 82.9 p.c. to
£14,630,975. Dividend - rate remained
steady at 10 p.c. despite a rise in paid
capital. The board continues a policy of
deliberate diversification of business
aimed at dampening the effects of fluctua-
tions in the volume of h.-p. transactions.
Finance Corporation of Australia,
Ltd., the leading South Australian h.-p.
financier, commenced business in Decem-
ber, 1954. Since then the co.’s progress
has been brisk and expansion rapid.
With the opening of a branch-office in
Perth last January, F.C.A. now operates
in all the mainland States. The Bank
of Adelaide is the co.’s main back-prop
with a 40 p.c. share-interest. Other
major shareholders are Pope Industries,
Ltd., and John Martin and Co., Ltd.,
an Adelaide retailer.
Boom conditions in the h.-p. industry
have subsided. Competition is severe,
costs of borrowing and operations are
rising, and the pattern of demand for
loanable funds is shifting. Despite this,
F.C.A. is steadily pushing-up its earnings.
Based on South Australia, the co. has
achieved a nation - wide geographical
spread of activities, enabling it “to meet
both economic conditions and changes
of a legislative nature in any particular
State without affecting overall stability.”
In addition to financing sales of
durable consumer-goods, etc., the co. has
built-up a prosperous business in real-
estate contracts, which last term
accounted for almost half of total out-
staridings. Financing real-estate contracts
is generally of a more long-term nature,
but this is compensated by a brisk and
steady demand. It is also safer from the
repossessions angle.
Consolidated net profit for the year
ended June 30, 1960, was £74,333 (or
48.7 p.c.) higher at £226,805, after set-
ting-aside £9737 for depreciation (up
£5371) and providing £176,827 for taxa-
tion (up £85,580):

previous term 17.6 p.c. in 1958 and 17.1

The div.-rate was steady at 10 p.c.,
absorbing £103,125. Reserves benefited
by £123,680 and rose to £299,861 subject
to £78,906 intangibles.
In 1958 the co. made a one-for-one
issue at par (partly called), lifting paid
capital to £875,000. Continuous expan-
sion called for further funds. On
September 30, 1959, the co. made a final
2s. 6d. a unit on a million ords. On
March 29, 1960, another one-for-two
issue of a million 10s. ords. (paid to 55.)
at par increased paid capital to £1,250,000.
After the balance-date the co. called-up
the remaining ss. a unit on the March
issue. Subscribed capital is now
£1,500,000.
Borrowings increased massively.
Debentures and deposits rose by
£5,144,075 to £12,054,740. Total out-

increased. Cash, etc., was lower. Un-
earned income at £1,533,172 (up
£842,490) was equal to 10.4 p.c. of total
outstandings, compared with 8.6 p.c. in
the previous year.
In relation to outstandings on h.-p.
contracts alone, unearned income repre-
sented 20.6 p.c., compared with 16.3 p.c.
in the previous term.
The ratio of debentures and deposits to
shareholders’ funds (less intangibles) was
8.2 to 1 (6.6 to 1 in 1959).
Approached soberly, h.-p. remains an
attractive long-term investment, although
windfall gains can’t be expected. F.C.A.’s
scrip has prpved to be a dynamic stock.
At the last sale in Adelaide the 10s.

diate yield is 3.8 p.c. on the basis of the
steady 10 p.c. div.-rate.

date was 11s. 6d. for each 10s. ord. (in-
cluding uncalled capital) on the basis of
consolidated accounts.
Newbold General Refractories, Ltd.
/”\perating at centres of industrial
activity along the N.S.W. coast, at
Newcastle in the north and at Wollon-
gong, Thirroul and Port Kembla in the
south, and under the very shadow of the
B.H.P. blast-furnaces, Newbold General
Refractories, Ltd., satisfies the bulk of
Australia’s requirements of high-grade
firebricks, heat-resisting materials, etc.
Products range an increasingly wide
variety of firebricks, fireclays, silica,
basic, graphite, super- and casting-pit-re-
fractories, insulation, refractory mortars,
mouldables and castables, induction
furnace-linings, acid-resisting materials,
shapes, nozzles, sleeves and crucibles.
Raw - material requirements are well
catered for, the co. owning extensive
mine and quarry interests throughout
N.S.W. —at Barraba, Bungonia, Cooma,
Coomabarabran, Marrangaroo, Merry-
goen, Neilrex, Puggoon, Redhead,

Group plant operated flat-out during
the year, the co. utilising 100 p.c. capa-

rose £52,902 (or 20.1 p.c.), and would
have been much greater but for the
unusually large tax provision (£341,850,
up £143,850) —the tax allocation indicates
a theoretical net profit closer to the
£500,000 - mark. Chairman Raymont
Moore comments: “Taxation is a par-
ticularly heavy charge ... We are not
allowed as a deduction such provisions
as plant-replacement, long-service leave,
doubtful debts, whilst the amount written-
off for depreciation which your board
considers prudent is not allowed in full
by the tax department.” Depreciation
and plant replacement took £165,106

A mutual non-profit organisation limited by guarantee
Registered under the National Health Act
REPORT OF THE HONORARY COUNCIL, FOR THE
FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30th JUNE, 1960
Adopted by the Annual Meeting of the Association held in the Board Room, The Mutual
Life & Citizens’ Assurance Co. Ltd. Building, Martin Place, Sydney, on Thursday, 27th
October, 1960.
The Council has pleasure in presenting the Fourteenth Annual Report and Financial
Statements for the year ended 30th -June, 1960.
DEVELOPMENT
As from Ist January, 1960, the Government increased Commonwealth benefits for
some 140 medical services and invited registered organisations to likewise increase their
benefits. Your Council, conscious of public demand, introduced Table J, which provides
a fund benefit equivalent to 166%% of the higher Commonwealth benefits. In addition,
higher fund benefits are paid for general practitioner services and a range of ancillary
services. The weekly contribution rate for Table J is only 4/- for families and 2/- for single
persons.
The public response to Table J has been most gratifying and over 1,000,000 persons are
already covered for the higher benefits. In Queensland and Tasmania many thousands of
contributors also took the opportunity to upgrade to hospital Table 48. The wide coverage
provided by this fund and other registered organisations is evidence of public approval of
the principles of the National Health Scheme.
A most important feature of the Fund is the decentralisation of its enrolment and
contribution collection activities through more than 10,000 employee-groups and chemist-
agencies, thus making it possible for the general public to qualify readily for National
Health Benefits. Employers generally recognise the importance of voluntary health insurance
and encourage this form of self-help by enabling their employees to have contributions
deducted from pay and, in some cases, by also subsidising contributions.
BLUE CROSS ASSOCIATION
The Fund is a member of the Blue Cross Association of Australia, which is the
co-ordinating body of the major non-profit health insurance funds in the Commonwealth.
Through its affiliation with Biue Cross, the Fund participates in a membership transfer
reciprocity agreement with the American Blue Cross Association operating in the U.S.A.
and Canada.
Blue. Cross also provides an interstate transfer reciprocity agreement whereby Fund
members who take up residence in another State and join an affiliated fund may preserve
their benefit rights.
BENEFITS AND ADMINISTRATION
The benefits history of the Fund is the most compelling evidence of its value to the
community. Contributors and their families have received benefits totalling more than
£46,200,000 since the Fund’s inception. The following figures reflect the rate of increase
in benefits paid over the last four years:
Year Ended
30/6/57
30/6/58
30/6/59
30/6/60
Total Benefits
£6,643,800
£7,916,000
£9,525,500
£11,103,900
Increase on
Previous Year
£1,288,800
£1,272,200
£1,609,500
£1,578,400
While the continued expansion in membership accounts for a proportion of the increase
in benefits there is evidence of a higher utilisation of medical and hospital services.
Records reveal a tendency for patients due for discharge to remain in hospital an extra
day or two “to complete the week.” Higher utilisation of medical services has caused a
significant increase in the payment of medical benefits.
Payment of small straightforward medical claims in cash over the counter, a feature of
Fund service almost unique in insurance of any kind, enabled the immediate settlement of
40% of all medical claims. All other claims were on an average settled by cheque within
a week. During the year additional cash claims offices were opened and more are projected
when suitable staff are trained and premises become available.
The staff maintained efficient service to the public in all States embracing the Fund’s
activities. In N.S.W. a non-profit company has been formed to act as managing agent for
the associated Funds, The Hospitals Contribution Fund of N.S.W. and the N.S.W. Branch
of Medical Benefits Fund of Australia. This will permit a closer integration of administrative
processes, thereby achieving economies and improved service to contributors.
CHRONIC AILMENTS
During the year the Fund continued to operate “Special” Accounts in accordance with
the provisions of the National Health Act for both medical and hospital benefits. Briefly,
the arrangement provides that a fund may transfer to the Special Account persons claiming
benefit for a pre-existing or chronic ailment or upon attaining annual benefit limits.
The Commonwealth Government underwrites losses in the Special Account, and in
return requires funds to liberalise membership conditions for the remaining contributors.
The Special Account has been the means of giving considerable assistance to the chronically
ill. However, your Council is of the opinion that the chosen methods are cumbersome and
wasteful and, accordingly, has recommended alternatives to the Government.
It is earnestly hoped that in the interests of contributors, the funds and the Government
an alternative method of operating Special Accounts on a transaction basis will be
implemented. FINANC ,*I STATEMENTS
Assets exceed £2,700,000, of which £1,838,000 are liquid. A contingent asset exists in
respect of Special Account expenditure still to be reimbursed by the Commonwealth
Government.
Administrative expenses for the year absorbed only 13-7% of income, despite the heavy
increase in salary awards and margins and costs of other goods and services.
The rising claims expenditure rate clearly indicates the wisdom of the Council’s action
over the years of establishing strong reserves in the interest of contributors. Council
recommends the transfer of the sum of £279,000 to Claims Reserve, bringing the total
Reserve to £2,706,300, which represents 16/9 per person covered.
APPRECIATION OF SERVICES
The Council expresses its thanks to: , , , .
Employers and group secretaries, to receiving agents, chemists and to members of the
medical profession who have co-operated so wholeheartedly in assisting their
employees and the public generally in securing the advantages of membership with
The 'affiliated Hospitals Contribution Fund of N.S.W. for its valuable assistance.
The Management and Staff, whose untiring efforts and helpfulness to the public have
assisted in building an unparalleled utility which is now a vital part of the

THE COMMENTATOR
By RAYMOND BARRY
The two of them were
scuffling when I turned
the corner. One had
pushed the other off his
feet on to the footpath and
was poised to kick him. Only
the difficulty of balancing on
one leg while he kicked with
the other slowed him. .1 could
see they were both very drunk.
They were outside a hotel in
Castlereagh Street and it was
close on midnight.
I wouldn’t have interfered
only for recognising the con-
testants. One, a youth called
Bennie Wilson, was always in
this kind of situation. He
thrived on it. The other was
named Cyril Grogan, but
everyone knew him as The
Commentator. I was surprised
to see him with Bennie. The
funny thing was neither of
them, drunk or sober, was a
good thing to knock a sick old
lady off her pot, as they say.
I pulled the one called
Bennie away and steadied him
against the hotel wall. In all
the time I had known him I
could never understand how
he had not been killed with
the trouble he caused when he
was drunk, which was most
of the time.
“The dirty mug! I’d ’a’
killed 'im if y’d left me
alone . . . The dirty mug!”
That’s all he could say, and
with some difficulty. He was
leaning against the hotel wall
and spitting blood from one
corner of his mouth where he
had a slight cut.
I lifted the one we knew
as The Commentator to his
feet and helped him find his
glasses. They were on the
footpath where he had been
lying, and unbroken. I put
them on him and guided him
towards a “No Parking” sign.
He was very dirty from lying
on the ground and had some
blood spattered, over his white
shirt.
“Can’ get a drink a’ thish
hour,” he was saying. He was
very drunk.
I had some trouble getting
taxi-drivers to take them,
although The Commentator
soon became quiet and even
tried to brush some of the dirt
from his suit. Bennie was
swearing and threatening to
knock everyone cuckoo. He
was always like that, and I told
the cab-driver to take no notice
of him. I knew he hated cab-
drivers.
Tt was the first time I had
seen The Commentator for
months and it made me think
seriously about him for the
first time since that afternoon
at the Quay.
The Commentator and
Bennie had been great friends
once, but I hadn’t seen them
together for ages. Bennie often
drank with us of an afternoon.
He had been the funny-man
of our drinking-school for
years, but he didn’t mention
The Commentator any more.
The Commentator came to
us out of nowhere. He might
have been a visitor from outer
space or the relic of a linger-
ing hangover, the way we met
him. As I remember it, Big
Larry and I were having a
quiet drink at a pub near the
Quay. We had had a very heavy
night the night before with two
dames from a coffee-lounge at
the Cross. They were more
than we bargained for, and
we were having a pick-me-up
away on the quiet, we thought.
Bennie found us inside two
shouts, as he always did. He
bounced up to us, looking
cheekier than ever and laugh-
ing at our heavy heads.
“Big night, eh, boys!” he
kept saying. “Big night!”
Until Big Larry threatened to
jump on his head if he didn’t
drink his beer and keep quiet.
It was about then this fellow
alongside us at the bar went
into this call:
“Yes, they’re moving into
line now . . . New Farm a
little fractious . . . Royal King-
dom goes straight into the
boxes, followed in by Com-
missionaire . . . Plymouth next
to go in . . . and they're almost
ready for dispatch now . . .”
“Who is this goose?” Larry
said.
That was Larry all over.
Straight out with it, whatever
he thought.
Then, before you could say
“They’re racing,” Bennie was
introducing to us a gangling,
pimply-faced youth named
Cyril Grogan. He was quite
tall and had a part in his hair,
which was brown and stood
up at the back of his head.
“The Commentator! ” Bennie
said and laughed loudly. The
name stuck.
“You’ll be hearing a lot
more of this boy,” Bennie
said. He was in his element.
The young man spoke with
a deep B-station voice and
stared vacantly ahead most of
the time he talked. Bennie
had already bought him a beer
and he was drinking it
thirstily.
“You call races?” Larry
asked him.
“It is my ambition to call
races,” the young man said
precisely.
“We might be able to place
you somewhere,” Larry said.
He was a great one for carry-
ing on with jokes Bennie had
started.
“What do you mean,
exactly?” the young man
asked. v

people’s names, some he
knew and some he didn’t. The

he would say. “This is where
we put in the groundwork for
your brilliant career.”
The joke had worn a little
thin with me, but Big Larry
still laughed himself silly at it
all. He always saw the funny
side in things Bennie did,
except when Bennie occasion-
ally bought him a fight. Then
he would get mad at him.
Bennie was small, about a
foot shorter than The Com-
mentator, it looked, as they
walked along the street to-
gether. He had a bad arm, his
left arm, which hung shorter
than the other from an attack
of polio he had as a child.
Everyone felt sorry for him
because of the arm, but a lot
of us who knew him well
thought he played on it a
little.
He would pick a fight and
say to some giant twice his
size: “You can’t fight! I can
do you with one arm.” Big
Larry, who was the only one
able to control him at all,
would say: “You! You’ve
had a hundred-and-eighty-
four fights for a hundred-and-
eighty - four defeats. You
haven’t even thrown a punch
yet.”
At this Bennie would laugh
and begin to behave himself
some. He was funny as a
circus, but hard to control
with drink in him.
Bennie and The Commen-
tator were the strangest double
the boys could remember.
“No bookie’d lay that double,”
they used to say.
Then Larry would tell the
story of how we discovered
The Commentator. He loved
to talk about little Bennie’s
exploits.
One day we took The Com-
mentator to Canterbury and
had him call two or three
races to us from outside the
course, using, of course, a
strong pair of glasses. It was
Bennie’s idea and we went
along with them for the joke.
He surprised us all, calling
accurately and well, and we
no longer thought of him as
simply a phantom-broad-
caster.
“Well, you’ve come through
that trial well enough,” Bennie
said professionally. He was
enjoying every minute of it.
Bennie worked as a bookie’s
runner quite often and knew
most of the bookies round
town. He got to a lot of book-
makers’ parties, sometimes by
invitation, sometimes not.
He’d take The Commentator
along with him to practise a
new routine on them and to
help Bennie gain admission.
They’re suckers for an enter-
tainer.
One thing, The Commen-
tator never would cause
trouble any place he went. He
was too devoted to his calling.
Bennie made a ritual of
bringing The Commen-
tator along to the Royal every
Friday afternoon to give us
a phantom-call of a race at
the trots that night.
The Commentator picked a
few winners in his early calls
and had quite a large clientele
after a few weeks.
“He’s gifted, this boy,”
Bennie would tell them. “Sees
a race twelve-hours ahead,
clear as day.” He would wink
at us and smile and you could
see he was loving every minute
of it.
Occasionally The Commen-
tator would get us into trouble
with his calls. One Friday
night he called a Qualifying
Stakes and had three horses
falling a lap from home. I
suppose he thought it had
added variety to his call.
As it happened, a boisterous
and half-drunk cousin of one
of the drivers he had called
falling was listening at his
elbow. It was all we could
do to stop him tearing The
Commentator and his manager,
Bennie, apart. He was very
wild.
We watched the race he had
called that night with some
anxiety. “If that horse falls,
I’ll murder you,” the big
cousin had said. He said it
as if he meant it.
There was no fall and, as
it happened, the horse in ques-
tion won handsomely.
“That was the only way I
could get it beaten, to have it
fall,” The Commentator said.
“I knew it was a certainty if
it stood up.” He shocked us
with his sense of humor some-
times, The Commentator. He
didn’t look a funny boy.
“He’s good, this boy,”
Bennie would say. “He’s good,
this boy of mine.”
'T'hen Bennie and The Com-
mentator parted as
quickly as they had joined-up.
The rift came when The
Commentator did a thing
none of us thought he had it
in him to do. He went on
his own and took a job on a
radio-station in town.
Before, he had been selling
shirts and ties in a men’s store
up on Broadway. It was hard
to think of him selling things.
Naturally the boys ribbed
Bennie a bit when they heard
what had happened.
“Don’t think he’ll get any-
where without me, does he?”
Bennie said. He was pretend-
ing to joke, but you could tell
by his tone of voice that he
was taking it hard.
“The Commentator is going
to call the Doncaster and
Sydney Cup, I believe,” Big
Larry said. “They say he

if r he decision was taken
T cprvin® due notice on the
«s Who are not
Of,L in Australia.
Jf October. 6, 1960, the
L stated that ‘ the fu
fit 0 f the subscription-
was not received by
i required under Section
of the Companies Act of
; south Wales. However,
Lations and subscnption-
Cneys which have since come
U hand have resulted in the
0 being oversubscribed.”
At that stage it was decided
to proceed with the allotment,
after advising the applicants by
circular that, if desired,
gfcation-moneys would be
refunded in full on written
request made by October 14.
The subscription - moneys
jutstanding on October 6 were
due from the American
interests sponsoring the float,
later a cheque on an overseas
bank was received to cover the
amount. The cheque was not
let on presentation, and the
tat izzled-out.
The directors say that all
application-moneys are held in
ispecial account at the co.’s
'tankers and are being distri-
buted as quickly as possible.
Tie underwriting brokers,
Ronald Walton and Co., would
not comment as to the future
of the co.
Texas Australian Explora-
tion, Ltd., was launched as a
N.S.W. - registered co. on
February 12, 1960, with con-
siderable publicity. Later
several announcements were
made about the proposed areas
of oil-exploration.
The prospectus for the issue
of four-million 2s. 6d. ords.,
dated July 28, said that by that
date 10,004 2s. 6d. ords. were
issued for cash (£1250) to the
subscribers to the memoran-
dum of association. Another
1,000,000 2s. 6d. ords. were
issued to the sponsoring Texas
American Oil Corp. as con-
sideration for an interest in
certain producing oilwells in
Texas.
Texas Australia’s float
aroused considerable interest,
and the co.’s foundering before
it started is perhaps regret-
table. But at least intending
shareholders are getting their
money back, which is to the
credit of the directors respon-
sible.
The prospectus listed as
directors N. L. Cowper (chair-
man), A. S. Bingle, F. A.
Brodie, L. J. Brain (all of Syd-
ney), and N. J. Dowdle, J. H.
Bartley and L. E. Innerarity
(all of Texas, U.S.A.).
Wattle Gully Gold Mines
The long - flowering Wattle
Gully Gold Mines, N.L., at
Chewton (Vic.), failed to
blossom last term. Results were
a disappointment to share-
holders and management alike,
the more so as hopes had been
high.
A new milling-plant, incor-
porating the latest ball-milling
process, was installed during
the year, managing-director C.
W. Vowell claiming that, with
an annual throughput of 60,000
tons of ore, the improvement
in recoveries would be worth
£24,000 a year, quite apart
from considerable savings in
labor costs. The old 50-head
stamper-battery was pensioned-
off in January, capital expendi ■
ture jumping £37,362 to £67,362
—total cost of the new plant
was £93,332.
Unfortunately, ore - supply
trailed expectations (plant
operated at below maximum
capacity), the co. treating
58,748 (59,894) tons of ore
to yield only 16,594 (19,097)
fine ozs. of gold. Recovery did
rise as anticipated, but grades
of ore-treated fell, the recovered
grade averaging 5.65 (6.37) dwt.
a ton.
Costs rose ; including labor
costs and plant-maintenance,
operating costs rising £2 ss. a
ton to £BB 6s. a ton. The co.
finally limped home with a net
loss of £B2l, as against profits
of £39,873 and £82,677 back to
1958. A single div. of Is.
(4s. 6d.), absorbed £9OOO
(£40,500). Finances sagged all
round with o.d. at £37,570
(£7349) and creditors at £20,409
(£22,461) at balance-date.
At June 30, proved and
probable ore reserves were
estimated to be 111,730
(215,710) tons with, as far as
sampling information permits
of reliable estimation, a mining
grade of 7.1 (6.2) d.wt. per
ton. There are, in addition,
160,000 tons of lode section,
but apparently of lower grade.
The situation at present is
not conducive to long-term in-
vestment, but immediate pros-
pects indicate improvement.
Alterations to the new plant,
with attendant reduction of
costs, augur better things, and
application for subsidy under
the Gold Mining Industry As-
sistance Act in respect of last
term’s operations should boost
current income.
There are, all told, 180,000
6s. Bd. shares issued, of which
120,000 are paid to 3s. Id., and
the balance fully-paid. Both
the contribs. and f.-p.s fetch
around 165., as against 295. a
year ago.

THE N.Z. MARKET
Wellington, October 24, 1960.
HThe chill breeze which has
been blowing through the
Australian sharemarket has
been felt in N.Z. only as a
draught.
Australian share prices have,
of course, fallen, but prices of
N.Z. issues have, so far, held
up fairly well, in spite of the
fact that heavy calls for new
issues are spreading available
funds more thinly.
In the last week or so, how-
ever, there have been signs
that investors are adopting a
more cautious approach, and
it looks as if the boom has
passed its peak.
In the week to October 21
falls outnumbered rises for the
first time since March.
Statistically there wasn't
much in it, but some of the
falls were significant because
they were recorded by leading
shares in the high-priced, low-
yield bracket. •
The market appeared to be
influenced not so much by over-
seas events as by the fall in
wool prices at the first main sale
of the season —expected though
the fall was. Wool prices are
the biggest single influence in
the New Zealand sharemarket.
That has been proved many
times.
At Maoriland's first main
wool sale of the 1960-61 season
there was a decline of about
\2\ per cent, for crossbreds
and 12| to 15 per cent, for fine
wools in comparison with the
opening sale last October.
A warning against optimism
on wool prices in the coming
season was given by the chair-
man of directors of the New
Zealand Co - operative Wool
Marketing Association, H. W.
Upton, at the association’s
annual meeting.
Information received from
the association's overseas con-
tacts was not encouraging, but
it was too early to be sure of
overseas trends, said Mr.
Upton.
Growers should not expect
to get more than ; 4od. a pound
for wool which would normally
bring up to 4d. a pound more.
About 3s. 6d. a pound was
regarded as a basic price, but
much average-to-good wool
might not sell that high.
The association’s general
manager, T. C. Allen, said a
subsidy on wool was becoming
more and more likely in Aus-
tralia ; this could, have a very
detrimental effect on prices for
New Zealand wool.
“Stable Industrial Climate”
The Government is to be
asked by the N.Z. Manufac-
turers’ Federation to legislate
for a new “stable industrial
climate.”
Sponsoring the resolution to
“ That's one for the road."
approach the Government, A.
L. Laidlaw, Auckland, told
conference of the federation
that the economic expansion
of industry could only be
achieved with a system of pro-
tection which gave a predict-
able future.
“We must be free from
violent changes and must be
ensured of a determinable share
of the N.Z. market,” said Mr.
Laidlaw.
He was sure the creation of
a predictable future for manu-
facturing must not be left com-
pletely with the political party
that happened to be in power
at any given time ; it had to be
written into the law of the
land.
The best way to finance in-
dustrial development in N.Z.
was to get debenture capital
from abroad and equity capital
from within this country, Dr.
W. B. Sutch, secretary of the
Department of Industries ana
Commerce, said at the N.Z.
Manufacturers’ Conference.
This would ensure that, when
debentures were paid off,
ownership of industry remained
in N.Z.
At present 26 p.c. of the
national income was being
spent on industrial develop-
ment. This was not enough,
but striving to increase the per-
centage was not the whole
answer. Much depended on
where the emphasis was placed.
Many roads, schools and
other amenities were required
before industrial development
could begin. Investors could
not be expected to put money
into a bare piece of land.
Ansett in N.Z.
Australia’s Ansett got South
Pacific Airlines (N.Z.) off the
ground by taking up a sub-
stantial, but minority, share-
holding. It was a happy end
to a struggle which many
people watched with sympathy,
though they weren’t prepared
to put up cash.
Ansett will find S.P.A.N.Z. a
useful extension of its own
lines for its packaged tours.
But its reason for getting into
the N.Z. company probably
goes much deeper than that.

Brighter Future for N.S.W. Coalfields
OVER THE HUMP
In the past few years the keynote
of the annual reports of the Joint
Coal Board has been one of caution.
In the board’s 13th annual report,
covering the financial year ended June
30, 1960, the caution is still there, but
optimism is beginning to show through.
Obviously the board feels that the coal
industry is over the hump and that with
careful handling better times lie ahead.
N. S. Wales coalfields produce 78 per
cent, of all black coal mined in Australia.
Queensland, the second - biggest pro-
ducer, is responsible for 12.5 per cent.
Since the end of World War 11, and
especially in the past decade, the coal-
mining industry in N.S.W. has under-
gone revolutionary changes. Not the Red
Revolutionary changes which at one
time seemed to be the goal on which
the miners, deluded by Communist
leadership, had set their hearts, but a
technological revolution which has re-
vitalised the industry and made it pos-
sible to reduce the price of coal at a
time when the trend in every other indus-
try has been towards higher prices.
Coal reached its peak price in 1952,
when the average price per ton, f.o.r.
collieries, was 645. 6d. In the year 1959-
60 the average price was 575. Id. This
represents a drop of 11 per cent. In the
same period the wholesale price-index
rose by 22 per cent, and the retail price-
index by 33 per cent.
Mechanisation
'T'he factor mainly responsible for this
“revolution” has been the mechanisa-
tion of the industry by the introduction
of mechanical cutters and loaders and
the so-called “continuous miner” which,
if not actually continuous in operation,
enables a high degree of continuity to
be maintained, as it is not dependent on
shotfiring to break down the coal-face.
Mechanisation is not yet universal in
the industry, but it is heading that way.
In 1959-60 fully mechanised mines
accounted for 73.2 per cent, of out-
put and partly mechanised mines for
21 pen cent. “Hand - mines” produced
only 5.8 per cent, of the total. The
process of mechanisation is still pro-
ceeding ; larger and more efficient
machines are being tested, and there is
talk of “remote-controlled operation of
production-units.”
The board claims that three groups
in the community have benefited from
all this—the consumers, the colliery pro-
prietors and the employees. That the
consumer has benefited is obvious;
lower-priced coal in a world of rising
prices should be evidence enough of
that. It is also true that mechanisation
has put the coalmining companies back
on their feet again after the knock they
took in the slump of the 1930’s and the
turbulent industrial conditions of the
early-postwar years. Non-profitable pits
have been closed, and the industry today
is more efficient than it has ever been.
The claim that the miners have also
benefited will be received with scornful
laughter in certain quarters, especially
among those with a vested interest in
industrial unrest and strife. These may
well ask how the miners can have
benefited from mechanisation when the
industry which in 1952 provided employ-
ment for 20,802 men can now find jobs
for only 13,315. An answer involves
several questions. Could the industry
have continued to employ the 7487 men
displaced if it had not become mecha-
nised? What has become of the men
displaced? Have the conditions of the
remaining work - force improved or
declined?
Difficulties
AT the time the mechanisation pro-
gramme was introduced the N.S.W.
coal industry was in the doldrums. High
costs, uncertainty of delivery, and ever-
lasting industrial disputes had lost it most
of its inter-State markets. Diesel fuel was
attacking it even on the home front —
the N.S.W. Government Railways—and
the threat of further competition from
residual oils, by-products of the re-
fineries already building or projected,
could be seen looming-up.
The industry was faced with the neces-
sity of reducing costs or watching its
markets dwindle and its losses soar.
Mechanisation, with consequent reduc-
tion in the annual wages-bill, was the
only solution. Large-scale reductions in
the number of men employed in the in-
dustry were inevitable, and that they
were clearly foreseen is evident from
a study of successive annual reports of
the Joint Coal Board for that period.
These also show that a committee repre-
senting all sections of the industry was
appointed to find ways of cushioning the
impact of the reductions.
As a temporary measure the re-em-
ployment committee, with Government
co-operation, was able to arrange for
many of the displaced men to be em-
ployed on public works in the coalfields
area, the board itself contributing a
considerable sum towards the cost. As
a more permanent solution many miners
were absorbed into other industries.
Despite the big reduction in the work-
force-7487 in eight years—the number
of coalminers registered as unemployed
on September 3, 1960, was only 132.
Although the board anticipates further
retrenchments in the South Maitland dis-
nc‘ and possibly the Western Di,l

compared with 2048 in 1958-59 J

fact that the inter-State markets hat
gone for ever. Oversea sales may]
increased, but the chief market ft
N.S.W. coal will always have to ti
found in N.S.W. It is expected that rail
way orders will continue to decline, T
In 1953-54 the N.S.W. Railways bo™
1,542,000 tons of coal. In the year just!
closed the figure was 1,039,000 tons, and
the board expects this to fall to 920,0001
tons in the current year and to 675,000 *
tons by 1964-65.
The same trend is anticipated in sales«
of bunker-coal to ships. All other mar- a
kets within the State are expected lo
expand. The requirements of the iron- 2
and-steel industry, already the biggest 1
customer, are expected to expand Wj
last year’s 4,287,000 tons to 5,035,®*
tons this year and to 6,395,000 tons b?*
1964-65. The erection of new power-*'
stations will increase the demand

3,899,000 tons to 4,440,000 tons M
1964-65. Additional orders from genej
industry and a slight recovery in “J

board estimates, raise this market W;
3,321,000 tons to 3,360,000 tons by tM
end of the five-year period.
If these estimates are fulfilled tne
domestic market for N.S.W. eoa '

provement of 2,568,000 tons on last ye ■

tried to steal the race by career-
ing away to a long lead that
lasted till they straightened for
home. Lord raced behind
Webster, with Tulloch next.
At the “two” Webster was
done with, and Lord took-over.
Sellwood moved Tulloch up
to challenge, and just for a
moment seemed anxious as
Lord matched strides with the
champion. Sellwood was going
to give Tulloch a taste of the
whip, but dropped it and had
“STICK ’EM UP!”
to resort to slapping his mount
with his hand. It was as much
incentive as the great cham-
pion needed ; he moved away
from Lord to win convinc-
ingly in 2.2}, just |sec. outside
the track record.
Although there were only
four runners, the Maribyrnong
Plate created a tremendous
amount of interest, and inter-
state rivalry. Young Brolga
carried Sydney’s hopes, Native
Statesman and Trim Boy had
the Adelaide money, and Mel-
bourne people hoped for
Valala. Between them, the
four had won 12 races since
the new season started in
August. Most money was for
the unbeaten Young Brolga,
who started at 5 to 2 on. The
favorite dwelt slightly at
barrier-rise, but he made-up
his ground well and was almost
on terms with the leader,
Native Statesman, at the
furlong-post. At that stage
Sellwood was riding Young
Brolga very confidently, but
when he asked the good-
looking chestnut for a bit more
the colt did not have it to give,
and Native Statesman was
threequarters of a length clear
on the line. Valala was only
a head away third, but Trim
Boy was well back.
Native Statesman is by Wilkes
(imp.) from Genoese by Dhoti
(imp.) from Genoa by Baralong
(imp.). A bay colt, he’s owned
in Adelaide by K. J. Powell and
his wife, and trained by Bart
Cummings. Native Statesman has
earned the right to be called Aus-
tralia’s best two-year-old, and will
now spell until he tackles the Sires’
Produce Stakes at Flemington in
the autumn.
The Wakeful Stakes (10
furlongs, for three-year-old
fillies) has many times given
an accurate lead to the Oaks,
the most-prized race for fillies
in the Calendar. Sellwood was
obviously testing Wenona
Girl’s staying powers in the
Wakeful on Saturday, as he
held her up to the last furlong.
Given rein, the good-looking
chestnut coasted home to re-
ward the few punters who laid
four’s on.
Against her own sex, Wenona
Girl should win the Oaks to-
morrow (Thursday), despite the
fact that she found the mile-
and-a-half of the AJ.C. Derby
beyond her. However, if the
bookies demand similar odds
about her in the classic, punters
would be better advised to
spend the time in the bar or the
tea-room, because the nagging
doubt remains about Wenona
Girl’s ability to get twelve
furlongs.
For the Oaks: Wenona Girl,
1 ; Lady Sybil, 2 ; Glimpse, 3.
• • • •
A very interesting race on
the Oaks Day programme is
the “Black and White” Provin-
cial Cup. It is the first time in
the century-long history of the
Melbourne Cup meeting that
country horses have been speci-
fically catered for, and it adds
to the appeal of the race that
the Glasgow (Scotland) firm of
James Buchanan and Co. have
put up the stakemoney for it.
No doubt in Scotland, at least,
the result of the Provincial Cup
will receive even more pub-
licity than the Centenary Cup.
Form of the runners will
puzzle metropolitan punters,
but Valdanthe may win from
Prince of Baghdad.
In last Saturday’s Hotham
Handicap so many jockeys
were reefing back their mounts
that such a proved stayer as
Grand Garry was forced to act
as pacemaker. However, Vic-
torian punters, having seen
most of the Derby Day races
won by visitors, had a warm
welcome for Nilarco, who
dashed clear at the furlong-
post to win from Gaybao and
the New Zealander Manchu.
“Post”: From a weight-
carrying angle, Mac’s win
under 9.1 in the Moonee
Valley Cup in 2.43 1/10 was
one of the best, if not the best,
in the records of this tradi-
tional lightweights’ race (estab-
lished 1882).' At any rate,
during the past 25 years Val-
curl’s win in 1946 with 8.13
in 2.46 (he had also won the
previous year with 7.9) ranks
next-best to Mac’s. In the
same period the impost carried
by M.V. Cup - winners has
averaged around 7.10 in an
average race-time of 2.45|.

stand out particularly in my
memory.
Lord Nolan’s (1908), because,
as a lad of eight, I bet a school-
mate an even shilling that Lord
Nolan would win simply be-
cause my father had said he
would. Even money! Surely
a shining example of the con-
fidence of youth.
Sassanof’s (1916), because the
race that year was set back to
the following Saturday owing
to a worse-than-usual Mel-
bourne deluge ; the only post-
ponement in the history of the
race.
Nightmarch’s (1929), be-
cause record Cup - winning
jockey, Bobby Lewis, then old,
“fought” his mount, the colt
Phar Lap (3rd), all the way.
That race was memorable, too,
in that it was the first Mel-
bourne Cup to be broadcast on
a national scale.
Phar Lap’s (1930), because,
by winning with 9.12 Phar Lap
vindicated my opinion that he
should have walked-in the
previous year with only 7.6.
Hall Mark’s (1936), because,
carrying 21b. more than the
minimum handicap for Derby
winners, and with a split heel
which left a trail of blood all
the way down the straight,
Hall Mark put up probably the
bravest performance by a
young horse in the annals of
the race.
Evening Peal’s (1956), be-
cause she beat champion Red
Craze (“Big Red” had narrowly
beaten her in the Caulfield Cup)
and thereby registered, I think,
the finest Cup win of the cen-
tury by a mare.

A. G. Daniels, owner of
Compass, may set his six-year-
old for next month’s Queens-
land Cup. The gelding very
comfortably won last Satur-
day’s Rhodes Handicap at
Canterbury Park; he came
from last, but he had been
travelling smoothly all the way,
and Mulley didn’t move on
him till they turned for home,
Compass may have his next
test for the Brisbane race in the
9|-furlongs Frank Underwood

There are some particularly
smart two-year-old fillies about
this season, and No Match,
“After all , this IS War!”
easy winner of the Canterbury
Graduation Stakes for this age,
could measure up to the best.
She was backed for a fortune
in the Gimcrack, but ran much
below expectations, though in
winning the Widden Stakes at
Randwick five days later she
raced right up to track gal-
lops. Well ridden by Mulley
at Canterbury, she had no
trouble beating the Canonbury
Stakes winner, Pan Shah.
There was some sign of
improvement in On the Move’s
third.
Riverina trainer M. N.
Dunley saddled Eternity for the
Second Novice, and the Royal
Empire gelding gave Cliff Clare
an easy ride. The favorite,
Burnham Castle, ran below
form, but both Panitoba and
Friendless, in the minor places,
could soon win.
Ornon, winner of the
Canterbury Encourage (11
furlongs 65 yards) is bred on
staying lines, being by Mal-
lowry (imp.) from Lady Silv,
a Silvius (imp.) mare from
Saintly Lady by St. Anton
(imp.).
In the small field of five
the Condell Park Handicap at
Canterbury looked a soft snap
for Mulley’s mount, Merry
Polly. Slow from the barrier,
she didn’t get a place. Light-
weight Goldent, who beat Aka-
tarawa a neck, with Amanullah
third, had won at six of his
nine previous starts in the coun-
try. In his Canterbury win he
was smartly ridden by Ray
Selkrig.
....
Sunny Royal, who had three
lengths to spare in the Third
Canterbury Novice, was bred
at Aluinn Stud, Roxburgh, and
is by Genetout (Fr.) from an
imported French mare Poupie
by Tifinar. He should soon
win again.
The “get square” race
worked out o.k. for many at
Canterbury, favorite Count
Fall doing the right thing for
them in the last, the Denistone
Welter. The 1\ furlongs was a
bit too far for Double Brace
(third), but he is fit and ready
to win at a shorter distance.
Tabulate and Uplands Lad
should benefit from the run.

were timed in an extraordinary
evening’s racing at Harold

in the Spring Cup the crowd
of close on 19,500 saw every

Diabolo Don’s existing record!
The Victorian, Heroic Action,
set the sizzling pace, with

broke at the start, fully 10
lengths behind the leader after
the first lap. At the bell Heroic
Action led from Southern
Van, Redwin and Apmat.

“Zorok”: Nominate the
fourth Test v. West Indies in
Melbourne in January, 1952,
as providing the most exciting
finish of any cricket Test ever
played in Australia. We were
9 for 222 in the second innings,
needing 38 to win, when big
left-arm bowler Bill Johnston
joined leg-spinner and hard-
hitting bat Doug Ring. They
got the 38 runs, mainly
through Ring’s hitting. The
West Indies lost because of
the wrong tactics of skipper
John Goddard, whose plan was
to tempt Ring into lifting one
into a fieldsman’s hands in the
outfield. Instead, Goddard
should have tried to cut down
Ring’s hits, and concentrated
on dismissing Johnston. Vice-
captain Stollmeyer tried to get
Goddard to alter his plan, but
the Indies skipper wouldn’t
admit his mistake till the game
was over. I very much doubt
that Bradman, Hutton or
Benaud, to name a few recent
skippers, would have lost a
game when he had such a
strong grip on it as Goddard
undoubtedly had on that fourth
Test when Johnston walked out
through the gate.

“Old Rep”: When Viscount
Cobham, G.-G. of N.Z., was
entertained at luncheon in
Christchurch by the Canter-
bury Cricket Association he
was presented with a pair of scarves
to commemorate his last appear-
ance at Lancaster Park as a
member of the touring M.C.C.
team of 25 years ago. In a gem
of a speech, he said that much
of the old spirit had been dried
out of the game by methods
foreign to it, chiefly the tactics
employed by captains and bowlers
in which the bowler made no
attempt to bowl at the wicket,
while the field-placing made attrac-
tive batting almost impossible. It
irritated spectators and was almost
as boring to the players. He
advocated a return to four-day
Tests, to bring the game back into
favor as an entertainment, and
compared the figures of a four-day
Test at Lord’s with those of a
five-day match under equal condi-
tions —figures strongly in support
of the shorter period. One thing
that had particularly struck him in
New Zealand was why N.Z. did
not produce any worth-while fast-
bowlers, when it could produce
such magnificent physical specimens
of young manhood as the All
Blacks, year after year.

“Kabara”: First century-
maker in the Melbourne
women’s cricket competition
this season, 20-year-old Lyn
Denholm (she made 111 for
Collingwood against Sunshine)
had totted-up six previous
hundreds. She began her
cricket as a 12-year-old with
Clifton Hill, then played with
Regent; this was her first game
with ’Wood. Last year she was
the youngest member of the
Victorian State side, and she’s
in the running to tour N.Z.
with the Australian side this
season. Apropos, women’s
cricket was first played in Vic-
toria at Bendigo in 1874, and
the Victorian Ladies’ Cricket
Association was founded in
1904 —so they’ve been at it a
deal longer than most of us
would have guessed.

“Lai”: George Tribe, former
Australian slow-bowler, now
back after several years of
cricket in England, is establish-
ing a coaching - school for
budding cricketers in the 10-to-
-14-years age-group. He has
the full support of his Mel-
bourne club, Yarraville, and
the idea is to start with school-
boys thereabouts and later
invite more from other suburbs,
the object being to stop the
youngsters from drifting away
to other sports. Mass cricket
coaching has been practised in
England for many years ; Tribe
names Brian Statham and
Freddie Trueman as two players
to graduate from these ranks
to the Test field.

At Cardiff on October 22

“Old Pivot”: Most of the
Victorian Football Associa-
tion’s leading clubs pay £4 to
£6 a match (as against £8 by
the V.F.L.). But prospective
players can earn as much by
working on Saturday morning.
To play football they have to
make a financial sacrifice, and
this many young men are un-
willing to do—even for sport.
The V.F.A. needs to do some
hard thinking about it before
next winter.

THE MONCKTON REPORT
Oelected editorial comment
on the report of the Monck-
ton Commission, which the
British Government sent to
Central Africa with the task of
“advising on the Constitutional
programme and framework best
suited to the achievement of
the objects contained in the
Constitution” of the Federation
of Rhodesia and Nyasaland:
London “Daily Mail”: “Flere
at last is a true picture. The
hopes, fears and wishes of
white and black populations
alike fall into place in this im-
partial record.
“Dislike of federation among
the Africans of Northern
Rhodesia and Nyasaland is
‘almost pathological.’ How has
it come about? One element
in it is the intimidation and
violence of extremists which
the Devlin Report overlooked,
but which the Monckton Com-
mission found ‘on a consider-
able scale.’
“Hostility to federation is
also due to British diffidence.
We did not try to explain it to
the Africans. We never demon-
strated to them the reality of
racial partnership. Nor were
they moved by the greater
material benefits brought by
federation.
“It would seem, then, that
we can do nothing except let
federation go; but, as the
report says, this would be a
great tragedy for the three ter-
ritories, for Africa, and for
humanity.
“Economically the federation
forms a perfect whole, and to
break it up would be disastrous.
The political consequences
would be even worse. If this
happens there would be ‘no
hope of survival for any multi-
racial society in Africa.’ ”
* * *
London “Daily Express”:
“The Monckton Report on
Central Africa stands or falls
by one test: Are its recommen-
dations likely to promote the
welfare and prosperity of the
people of Central Africa, black
and white?
“On that ground the report
must be utterly condemned.
For, at a moment when Africa
is already in a dangerous state
of turmoil, it adds new dis-
order.
“At a moment when it
should be the aim of states-
manship to damp down the
anti-white prejudices that are
the curse of Africa, the report
invests those prejudices with
permanence and authority.
Where certainty is the supreme
need of the situation, the report
adds its own element of un-
certainty.”
* * *
London “Financial Times”:
“Somehow, unless they were
to throw up their hands in
despair of any future for the
federation, the commissioners
had to fashion a new structure
which would be at least barely
acceptable to African opinion
(particularly in the two North-
ern territories) and which would
also preserve the considerable
economic benefits that federa-
tion has brought to the area.
“Their proposed reconstruc-
tion can best' be understood in
terms of these two distinct
motives. On the one side —
to conciliate the Africans —are
the proposals to reform the
federal assembly on the basis
of parity of representation be-
tween the two races, reallocate
powers to the territorial
Governments and concede a
conditional right of secession at
some future date. On the other
—to safeguard the economic
benefits of federation —is the
emphasis that financial and
overall planning control must
remain firmly at the centre.
It is along these lines that the
commissioners have attempted
to strike a balance. It goes
without saying that it will not
necessarily work.”
* * *
London “Daily Telegraph
“These are admirable reforms
which, if implemented years
ago, might have saved the day
for federation. Delay coupled
with vicious attacks by the
British Labor party may have
caused African nationalism to
have outpaced them. The sad
truth is that the African
nationalists are no longer satis-
fied with sharing power with

the whites. If offered the whole
cake —which is what the right
to secession implicitly does
offer —it cannot be doubted
that they will be unwilling to
settle for less.”
* * 9
London “Economist”: “What
the Monckton Commission has
tried to do —with courage and
considerable insight, as well as
commendable ingenuity—is to
build a psychological bridge
over which black and white in
Central Africa can advance to-
ward each other, if either side
has the wish to do so. The
commission asks that the whites
shall take a calculated risk. It

“The struggle to create.” The phrase met my
eye recently in an article on the evolution of art
through the ages.
I have borrowed it because it seems to describe
so aptly the nature of our task as holders and
inheritors of this continent. All life is struggle, in
the sense that it is a striving for survival and success
in whatever environment we may find ourselves.
And the continual unfolding of creation is one of
the laws of life.
Applying it to ourselves in Australia: We have
here a country generous in area, rich in resources,
and, as yet, taken only to the fringe of its
productive fullness.
The changes that have been made on the face
of Australia in the fewer-than-two-hundred years
since it was a wilderness are as little compared with
what will be done with it in the years to come.
In the midst of this we are cast—fortunate
beyond words in having so much materially upon
which to work, and obliged by the very magnitude
of this gift to match it in the effort we apply now
to our country’s advancement.
There can be no separating achievement, on
the one hand, from the facing of its toils and the
wrestling with its problems on the other. And after
all, what are our problems, alongside those
confronting millions who are living in overcrowded
countries or have been rendered stateless through
the violence of war and suppression?
In utter thankfulness for the opportunity to
engage in this straight striving to conquer a
continent, we should each be giving of our faithful
best to the Australian cause.
And the goal should be more than temporal
success, for without the strengthening of our
spiritual and moral fibre the richest material gains
would be empty and meaningless.
That is what I see in the term “the struggle
to create,” as it rests upon us here. Its implied
challenge is very real. But so are the limitless
rewards to be found in Australia’s creation.

Pavlov and
Khrushchev
T AST May Dr. William
Sargant, eminent clinical
psychologist and author of
The Battle for the Mind, a
book on the techniques of
brainwashing, aroused some
interest by suggesting in a
letter to London “Times’ 5 that
Khrushchev’s tactics of blowing
hot and cold at the West over
Summits, disarmament, etc.,
have been based on the experi-
ments by which the Russian
scientist Pavlov induced ner-
vous breakdowns in dogs—
Khrushchev’s design being to
cause a similar paralysis of the
will among the mass of the
Western people.
In the course of a lengthy
critical analysis of this theory
in the British magazine “The
World Today,” H. T. Willetts
touches on public reactions to
news of world affairs as
received from the Western
press:
“If we regarded the popular
press as an accurate mirror of
the public mood we might
think that it oscillates between
wild alarm and fatuous
optimism, so that the Soviet
Union could, as Dr. Sargant
hints that it does, carry-out
its Pavlovian experiments by
remote-control, through the
medium of our newspapers.
My impression is that any
item of news on international
affairs must be heavily charged
with sensationalism to pene-
trate to the mass readership,
and that even so it usually
produces only a slight frisson.
“I am ready to believe that
Soviet experts have considered
the uses and limitations of this
particular medium —there is no
obvious reason why they
should not understand the
relationship between press and
public in this country. If so,
they may have realised that
it is in fact difficult to fix the
attention of the public on a
baffling series of contradictory
or meaningless signals: most
people quite automatically do
what Dr. Sargant advises and
ignore them. On the other
hand, it is quite easy to
imprint on the consciousness
of the public a constantly
repeated, simple disturbing
image
“The Soviet experts have
surely realised that their mass

affairs. No one who is not
paid to do so will follow the
intricate course of prolonged
negotiations even on such a
fateful matter as disarmament.
Most people regard such dis-
cussions as a complex game, in
which it is very difficult for
the outsider to understand any
particular move, and which is
likely to go on inconclusively
for a very long time. They
therefore do not follow these
things closely.
“Can we seriously imagine
that the Soviet Union could
alarm the British people (even
with the maximum assistance
from irresponsible sections of
the press) by iffing and offing
about a Summit Conference
—unless, of course, the break-
down of such a conference
meant imminent war? As it
is, they do not expect Summit
Conferences to settle very
much for very long, nor any
worse result of breakdown
than a period of tiresome
preparation for another con-
ference.
“I am not saying that this
is the healthiest and most
desirable state of mind for the
public to be in—only that, if
my estimate of public opinion
on such matters, which can
neither be supported nor
refuted with scientific evidence,
is correct, the Soviet Union
would be wasting its time to
indulge in some of the exer-

[the U.S.] are not imperialists,
We never were imperialists,
Our tentative, highly self-con-
scious, highly imitative adven-
tures in imperialism at the turn
of the century were short-lived
and ended in remorse.
“As far as concerns China,
now our principal accuser in
this respect, we have always
been anti-imperialist. During
the entire history of our rela-
tions with China, as the record
plainly shows, we have
defended her territorial and
administrative integrity. This
was the fundamental principle
around which our whole Far
Eastern policy was built. The
Russians know (though it is
convenient for them to forget
it) that it saved them the mari-
time provinces of Siberia.
“The nations on both sides
of the Iron Curtain should
know, finally, that we are not
merely the leader of a defen-
sive alliance but rather a par-
ticipant in a common effort
on the part of free nations and
nations emerging into freedom
to build a community of peace,
in which mankind may emanci-
pate itself from hunger and
disease and improve its stan-
dard of living, as modern
science and technology have
now, for the first time in his-
tory, made universally pos-
sible.”

“New York Times": “What
is happening, it seems clear, is
that there is a growing opinion
within the United Nations in
favor of the doctrine of ‘univer-
saiity’—that is, a belief that
even though Communist China
has scarcely shown itself to be
a ‘peace-loving’ nation within
the meaning of the Charter,
and even though Communist
China stands branded as an
‘aggressor’ by the United
Nations itself or by its action
in Korea, it is desirable to make
membership in the Assembly as
universal as possible, so that all
nations may be brought within
the scope of its discussions,
subjected to its influence and
affected by its decisions.
“There is reason to believe,
from the record of the votes
over recent years, that this
sentiment in favor of ‘univer-
sality’ will grow and that a
point may be reached in the
not-too-distant future when
the United States and its allies
on this question will find them-
selves outvoted. We will be
wiser to anticipate this possi-
bility, and give thought to it,
rather than permit it to catch
us unprepared.”

Manchester “G u a r d i a n":
“The spread of nuclear
weapons in Europe is one of
the greatest potential threats to
world peace. It cannot be con-
fined to Europe. After France,
China; after China India.
Secondly, no European country
can afford to develop a nuclear-
weapons system of its own
without cutting-down its con-
ventional forces. But if the
defence of Europe rests mainly
on nuclear weapons, the risk of
accidental war is increased. Mr.
Cousins [British trade - union
leader] has compared the
United States and Russia to
two ‘mad groups’ lusting ‘to
have a go at each other.’ In
fact, neither side would be
likely to start a world war
deliberately. But so long as the
defence of Western Europe
rests chiefly on nuclear
weapons even a trivial frontier
skirmish could develop into
all-out war, simply because
there would be too few conven-
tional forces to counter a con-
ventional attack. A first priority
of British foreign policy should
be to dispel that nightmare.”

Chicago “Sun Times": “Pre-
sident Soekarno, self-pro-
claimed ‘neutral,’ returns to
Indonesia with the promise of
an increase in United States
military aid to his country.
The new funds will push to-
ward the billion - mark the
money Indonesia has received
from the United States since
World War 11. But Soekarno
is strictly non-partisan in the
matter of accepting foreign aid
"In the past four years he has
had $368,000,000 in credits
from the Soviet Union, besides
smaller loans from other
countries.
“But Soekarno’s non-parti-
sanism ends right there.
“At th e current United
Nations meeting he followed
the Communist line faithfully
in denouncing Western ‘colo-
nialism’ and ‘imperialism,’ with
never a whisper about the
rampant colonialism and im-
perialism of the world’s greatest
offender —Russia.
“This philosophy is increas-

their animals and their dogs,
something to lift the heart, and
freshen pride of country, and
stimulate the ambition of the
generations to follow.
Sydney Harbor, which lends
itself to embellishment, which
long ago lost the natural wind-
carved graces of its overhang-
ing cliffs, deserves better treat-
ment than it has had. The
mast of H.M.A.S. Sydney
stands by the old fort at
Bradley’s Head ; the prow is
cemented into a wall and road-
way at North Sydney. They
are at best poor acknowledge-
ments of the debts we owe to
the fighting Sydneys and their
men ; not for a moment to be
compared to the delightful
little bronze ship at Glenelg
which honors the South Aus-
tralian pioneers. At either
spot, or both, the sculptor
could be employed to advan-
tage.
On what is perhaps the best
site on the Harbor—what a
magnificent tourist-hotel could
be erected there —a granite
monument to Lieutenant An-
derson (who,, with Sergeant
Hitchcock, was lost looking for
the Southern Cross) stands
amongst the stacked-up privies,
the heaps of old tramway-
metal, the broken pipes and
rusted iron of the Mosman
Council Dump. Our pioneer
airmen deserve something
better.
At Careening Cove and
Neutral Harbor, where sealers
and whalers once congregated,
there ..is nothing to commemor-
ate the once great industry
which had its headquarters
there, though on a nearby hill
Ben Boyd’s name is remem-
bered in a street, and in a
small slab of concrete on which
there is a rough relief of his
ship Wanderer. Rough as it is,
this tiny art-work attracts a
good deal of attention ; many
a child has taken his first real
interest in history because of
some such artifact.
'T'he great iron-and-steel in-
A dustry of Australia had its
birth at Mittagong, a happy,
sleepy little town on the Hume
Highway dreaming itself into
decadence.
Why this should be is not
clear; its near neighbor, Bow-
ral, which lies off the main
stream of traffic, is bustling and
progressive enough; and is,
indeed, a breeding-ground of
ideas, being much frequented
by writers and artists, though
it shares its scenic attractions
with neglected Mittagong.
Few people know that iron
was first discovered here ; the
Chalybeate Springs, which once
advertised the presence of the
metal and dispensed an occa-
sional healthful draft to num-
bers of devotees, were sacrificed
in war-time to the exploring
fingers of the industry, re-
probing, unsuccessfully, an
earlier ground.
At this point, where the
spring once flowed, the industry
owes Australia a significant
memorial of substantial dimen-
sions, perhaps a tribute to the
miner, or to the discoverer —
it doesn’t really matter; a
fountain, perhaps, because the
Springs were loved and are
remembered. By such a gesture
the industry could gain esteem,
and the town a recognition of
its individuality.
For that matter, there are
other things at Mittagong to
commemorate: oil - extraction
from shale, for one. To look
a little more closely, it seems to
this observer, at least, that
Mittagong has always been
faintly ashamed of the fact
that the Farm Schools are in
the area, an embarrassment that
not only does the town no
credit, but to some extent is
antagonistic to the cheerful
progress of this necessary and
admirable work.
There is little doubt that
local opinion in this, as in a
thousand matters in a thousand
towns, could be influenced for
good through the medium of
art; that a sculpture proclaim-
ing a civic pride in the redemp-
tion, or the attempted redemp-
tion, of wayward youth could
be a focal point for the altera-
tion for good of the local atti-
tude.
T eo Tolstoy said it in 1898:
- L/ “Art is not a pleasure, a
solace or an enjoyment; art is
a great matter. Art is an organ
of human life, transmitting
man’s reasonable perception
into feeling . . . All that now,
independently of the fear of
violence and punishment,
makes the social life of man
possible ... all this has been
brought about by art . . . Art
can ... evoke reverence for
the dignity of every man.”
In America’s current great-
ness, it seems to me that art
has played a significant part.
For a period I travelled every
day from Chelsea, near Green-
wich Village, to the Midtown
area, passing on the way the
statue of Horace Greeley—a
sufficient spur for any journal-
ist who in his work.
Further uptown and even
more inspiring, was the bas-
relief of the Communications
Industry above the entrance to
the newspaper - building in
Rockefeller Centre. This itself
was posed immediately above
that glorious statue of Prome-
theus, which commemorates
man’s adaptation of power to
make modem communications
possible.
It little matters that the cynic
passes these things by; their
influence lives and is a stimu-
lus ; and American youth trans-
lates that stimulus into an
application of energies.
Tt is no exaggeration to say
A that Central Australia’s
tourist-trade—which, since the
general application of long-
service leave, is now advancing
at a phenomenal rate —owes a
very great deal indeed to the
art of Albert Namatjira.
Ten - thousand tourists will
visit remote Ayers Rock this
year ; the average of them will
spend at least £lOO. It was
Namatjira and no one else who
awakened Australian conscious-
ness to the beauty of the inland
ranges. (Else why are the
equally beautiful and more
accessible ranges in the Mount
Isa district neglected?) Yet
Namatjira’s grave is unmarked;
and, judging by Northern Terri-
tory precedent, if and when he
is remembered it will probably
be by a cairn of stones or a
cheap bronze plate.
If there were to be a statue
of Albert erected, twenty or
thirty feet high, in the gateway
to his country—the beautiful
and significant Heavitree Gap
—about twenty-thousand tour-
ists every year would photo-
graph the memorial, and show
their photographs when they

emotional outburst, incorporat-

he finished the announcer in
charge came on and intro-
duced him and gave him a big
wrap.
“He’s kicked-on just like I
told you,” Larry said.
Bennie was pretending not
to be listening, and concen-
trating on his cards. He was
playing Larry gin, and cheat-
ing whenever he got the
chance.
A fter that all the boys
ribbed Bennie more.
Bennie would get annoyed at
them, I remember, and in the
next few weeks got into more
arguments than usual.
Meanwhile The Commen-
tator’s voice came over more
and more frequently. They
even had him doing a half-
hour sports-show of his own
during the week. We hardly
ever saw him.
One night he waved to us
across the bar. He was drink-
ing with a young man in a
dark-grey suit and wearing a
canary-yellow vest. The Com-
mentator wore a hat, and it
was the only time I ever saw
him in a hat. He wore a hat
with rope-effect on the side. It
was a Swiss-mountaineer type
of thing and looked quite
smart, although I didn’t think
it suited him very well.
Bennie wanted to go across
and fight him.
“Mug! Wouldn’t talk to
me,” he said.
“That would be an even
match,” Larry said. “But I’d
have to back the old Com-
mentator.”
“You’ve never backed a
winner in your life.”
“I’ve never backed you in
e stoush, Les Darcy, and I’m
not going to start now.”
It wasn’t long after we saw
him that day and wearing his
Swiss-mountaineer hat that
The Commentator’s voice
stopped coming over the air.
We thought he must have been
sick or maybe on holidays,
although he hadn’t been there
long enough to earn holidays,
we thought.
It was just after his station’s
number-one race-caller went on
holidays, and we were all wait-
ing to hear The Commentator
call the horses. We thought
they’d let him call the two or
three meetings while their regu-
lar caller was on holidays.
Instead they took a relay
from the A.8.C., and The Com-
mentator didn’t come on the
session at all that afternoon.
We didn’t know if that had
broken his spirit or what had
happened. We heard a lot of
stories after that, and one that
The Commentator had been
drinking a lot and one day
abused a high-ranking studio-
director.
This didn’t sound like The
Commentator as we used to
know him, but we said he
might have picked-up some bad
habits from Bennie, and put it
down to that.
The Commentator soon after
tried to get back into our com-
pany, but Bennie made such an
awful squeal, The Commentator
went off with his tail between
his legs. He was half-drunk
and not very clean and didn’t
seem to know where he was.
We heard about him and how
he was drinking after that, but
I didn’t see him around any of
the usual places and Bennie and
the boys said they hadn’t seen
him.
'T'hat’s why I was surprised
A to see him there on the
footpath that night, and with
Bennie. Apparently they had
met that afternoon and decided
to have a night on the town for
old time’s sake. They were
out on their feet when they got
outside the Castlereagh Street
pub, and Bennie had it in his
head to knock-up the publican
and get them a drink.
And so they brawled and their
old grievances came out. Bennie
was on the point of having his
first victory in 185 fights when
I intervened. When I told the
boys later they all wanted to
know who had won the encoun-
ter. It was declared “no con-
test,” I told them. Bennie was
too drunk to remember
properly who was on top at the
time and couldn’t brag about
his win over The Commenta-
tor.
We still don’t see much of
The Commentator, who is
about 25 now and drinking a
lot. I don’t know what began
the heavy drinking, whether it
was the disappointment at the
radio-station or whether he had
been drinking heavily and that
had caused him to lose the job.
Or perhaps it was Bennie’s bad
influence on him. Bennie is
funny, like I said, but he’s not
a mother’s ideal choice of com-
panion for her son, especially
if he is a little green, like The
Commentator was.
Sometimes we see The Com-
mentator now at the races, but
not often. Occasionally he is
at the Sunday trotting-gym-
khanas in a brown cardigan
and unshaven, and with one
hand up to his ear to block-
out the course - broadcaster’s
call so that he can give his own
description of the races.
I don’t suppose he will ever
broadcast a Melbourne Cup
over a national network now.
That’s a pity, I think, because
he has a voice that is easy to
listen-to, and knows his horses.


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Praise for Italians
“Macaroni’s” article in B.
12/10/’6O calls to mind a
lengthy trip to N.Q. in 1932-33
and another in 1954. How
right he is, and what a raw deal
many good Australians received
from the Government in 1942-
43, just because they had been
born in Italy!
In 1932 at Trebonne, an
almost entirely Italian town,
out from Ingham, I was invited
by the Italian hotel-proprietor
to come into the bar after
Saturday lunch. I told him I
wasn’t thirsty and had dined
well; besides, most Australian
bush-pub bars on a Saturday
afternoon are given over to
those who prefer to keep an
s.-p. bookie in affluence, and,
never having had any interest
in racing, I was a bit chary.
“But,” my host said, “we shall
have some music. Please come.”
So in I went, with visions of
a wireless blaring or perhaps
an ancient gramophone.
After introductions all round
the music started. Four burly
Italian farmers, each with a
glass of red wine in front of
him, started singing. And could
they sing! Unaccompanied by
any musical instrument, great
Italian operas, folksongs from
the hills of Sicily, musical-
comedy and one or two
anthems followed in succession.
It was a wonderful perform-
ance. Their little glasses of
wine lasted an hour or more —
just a sip after each song.
There was no “shouting,” each
man paying for his own drink,
and I suppose three little glasses
saw them out. About 5-o’clock
they said they must go home.
I wanted to buy them a drink
each, to show my appreciation:
“But no, signor, it is not per-
mitted. You are a visitor and
our guest.”
I went back to Ingham in
1954 and saw its war memorial.
More than half the names on
it, many among them of those
who did not return, were
Italian.
Back in 1932, at Innisfail, l
had tackled the visiting police-
magistrate bluntly on the sub-
ject of Italian immigration into
N.Q., for I knew him to be a
man of very sane judgment (he
was later Chief Stipendiary
Magistrate in Brisbane). He
was quite frank. Italians were
the best immigrants who had
ever come into the North, he
said, and as workers unsur-
passed. I then asked him about
the incidence of crime. He

State of the Rails
Just to hand, the Common-
wealth Railways’ Annual
Report for 1960 is a document
of more than ordinary interest.
Well produced and well illus-
trated, it is a record of effici-
ency in pleasing contrast to the
sagas of misfortune (or in-
competence) that some of the
States receive from their Trans-
port Departments.
Again, every section of the
system save that in the A.C.T.
has shown a real profit, calcu-
lated after paying interest on
loan - moneys. Percentages of
profit on capital involved are:
Trans-Australian, 3.43 ; Cen-
tral Australian, 2.17; North
Australian, 1.65 ; loss on the
A.C.T., 12.40 ; overall, a net of
2.64 per cent.
Considering that the Com-
missioner operates three of the
biggest problem lines in Aus-
tralia Darwin to Larrimah
(316 miles), Port Augusta to
Alice Springs (757) and Port
Augusta to Kalgoorlie (1108) —
where he has to contend regu-
larly with sand - drifts and
water-shortages (Central Aus-
tralia), water-shortages (Kal-
goorlie) and floods (Darwin-
Larrimah), the result is all the
more creditable.
Staff turnover is still the
biggest worry. Freights and
fares are still unaltered from
the 1951 level, all rises in wages
and materials being absorbed
by increased efficiency.
But what annoys a lot of
people, particularly customers
in the Centre, is that the Com-
missioner is compelled to sub-
sidise the South Australian
Electricity Trust —to the tune of
£766,321 for the year ended

30/6/’6O. This represents the
difference between the freight
actually charged the Trust on
Leigh Creek coal and the
standard freight-rates for the
mileage concerned. Yet last
year S.A. Premier Playford
soaked the Commissioner for
an extra sd. on every 1000
gallons of water the railways
drew from the Morgan-Whyalla
pipeline. As 61,755,000 gallons
were used, this increase repre-
sented £1286 11s. 3d.
The Commissioner expects
tonnages of coal almost to
double between now and 1967
(from a little over one-million
tons annually to two-million),
so users of the line are making
the S.A. Electricity Trust a
present of over £750,000 a year,
which will increase as the ton-
nage goes up.
In the Trust’s early stages
some assistance was no doubt
justified, but it’s time it stood
on its own hind-legs, and
ceased leaning on the Com-
missioner's other customers,
who are denied freight-reduc-
tions they would otherwise get.
When Tom Playford goes to
the Loan Council we never
“The only thing I ever get out of 'em is a
king-size cough!"
hear anything of that £750,000.
As total earnings for the Cen-
tral Australian system in 1960
were £1,659,855, an equitable
payment by the Trust would
enable drastic reductions in
both fares and freights, and so
do something substantial to
counter the high living-costs in
the Centre.—-D.C.T. (N.S.W.).
N.T. Rivers
It looks as if, at long last,
two at least of the major
Northern Territory rivers may
be put to some economic use.
The old Victoria (first river in
the Territory to be systematic-
ally explored) is being surveyed
so that cattle may be shipped
from it, and, if Territory rice
survives its birth-pangs, there
appears some prospect of the
Adelaide being used, instead of
dragging the product into Dar-
win.
It has always been a mystery
to me and many others why it
is held that everything used in
the northern part of the Terri-
tory should be brought to Dar-
win and that everything shipped
outwards should use Darwin as
a port.
True, the Roper, the Ade-
laide and the Victoria are sub-
ject to violent flooding—with
floods that make those on the
eastern seaboard look like
minor creeks. But these floods
can be controlled by damming,
and all three rivers offer natural
sites for control-works.
They are big rivers by
any standards. Along their
banks are literally millions of
acres of good agricultural land,
unused, in the case of the Roper
and Victoria, for growing any-
thing at all. We are told that
world - population increase is
outstripping food - production.

In local-government there is,
unfortunately, no incentive to
thrift and no Opposition, how-
ever feeble, to act as scrutineer
in the interests of ratepayers.
D. C. Tilghman has done a
service in suggesting that the
State Opposition be approached
to secure restoration of pro-
visions in the Act for a poll
of ratepayers before money is
borrowed. This would put
some semblance of equity into
the business. —J.S. (N.S.W.).
Though generally I disagree
with D. C. Tilghman’s conten-
tions, I must admit that in some
isolated instances local-govern-
ment has entered into unjusti-
fied commitments.
In the Blue Mountains area
enormous sums have been out-
layed by borrowing initiated by
1.-g. to provide sports-grounds,
swimming-pools, drives and the
like, and property-owners are
covering these imposts by in-
creased rates. But the locality
exists on visitors and would not
draw without these modern
recreational facilities, and how
else can they be provided?
True, aldermen and council-
lors have sometimes implicated
ratepayers in unsound proposi-
tions, but in the main they have
done fairly well. Big-business-
men, M.P.s, bankers and others
make serious mistakes, too.
Local - government representa-
tives measure-up pretty well
with all of them.
My greatest complaint is that
the execution and practical
management of many 1.-g.
schemes leave much to be
desired ; that we don’t get
effective production from every
employee. Probably this is
more evident in local-govern-
ment than elsewhere. Plant-
wastage and staff-arrangement,
together with increasing over-
head, is the bugbear—all call-
ing for constant inquiry.
Then there are the large pro-
vincial towns —Bathurst and
Orange (N.S.W.), for instance
—that vie with each other for
attractions. If one has a race-
track the other must do like-
wise. Rivalry leads to added
expenditure, which falls largely
on ratepayers.
When local-government was
first established in Australia its
prime object was to look after
roads, footpaths, bridges, etc.
Today its ramifications have
widened even to providing
aerodromes. The changing and
progressive state of affairs must
be recognised.
Ratepayers are being hit
harder and harder, but is there
any other workable solution to
local-government in planning
the development of this
country?—C.B.M. (N.S.W.).


THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
CENTRAL QUEENSLAND PASTURES
From “RODGER”
was planted in the
rich, grey ash left by the
fierce fires of the early 1920’5,
when the brigalow and soft-
wood scrubs of Central
Queensland were felled and
burned.
The paddocks were planted
with Rhodes-grass about the
end of February, when the first
bolls were speckling brown
and beginning to burst into
puffs of white lint. The late
summer rain germinated the
grass-seed and the foliage of
the cotton-bushes protected
the tender grass from the bite
of winter frosts. Spring
thunderstorms and warm
weather made the grass stool
vigorously and run to seed.
Once the grass had seeded, it
could be grazed without fear
of endangering the stand of
pasture.
On the scrub country
Rhodes-grass reigned supreme.
It withstood the ravages of
fires and overstocking, Even
the disastrous drought of the
The Australian Wool

conducted tests for the

pital, Melbourne, on a

blanket. These blankets
are structurally and
chemically treated to
repel water.
As found by discern-
ing graziers everywhere,
Elastrator is the only
method of castrating
and tailing lambs and
calves. Elastrator
lessens the risk of
disease, because there
are no open wounds to
harbour germs. This
must surely lower the
lamb mortality rate, and
keep production at a
high level, which would
mean an increase in
returns. Next time you
castrate and tail your
lambs and calves, use
Elastrator, the humane
method
early 1930’s failed to kill it.
The paddocks were so bare
then that you could have
flogged a flea with a stockwhip
across them without once los-
ing sight of it. Three months
after the drought-breaking
rain the grass was fence-high
again.
Butter-factories in the Upper
“That plurry quick reply !”
Burnett and Callide Valley
owe their existence largely to
Rhodes-grass. Mobs of prime
bullocks, fattened on this grass,
have walked the stock-routes
to Gladstone meatworks.
Rhodes-grass is still the
main pasture on cleared scrub-
land and is being improved by
the addition of panic and
lucerne. The vigorous Rhodes-
grass provides shelter for
panic until it becomes estab-
lished, while lucerne adds pro-
tein to the mixture and acts
as a soil-improver.
Hay made from this mix-
ture in the early flowering
stage is very palatable and not
far behind lucerne-hay in
feed-value.
A mixture of Rhodes, green-
panic and lucerne is relatively
easy to establish, will stand
heavy stocking and revives
quickly after a drought. It
also yields heavy cuts to the
acre if mown at the right
time.
The life of these improved
Rhodes-grass pastures is leng-
thened if they are grazed intel-
ligently. The use of temporary
fences on smaller farms, to
restrict stock to a certain area
and prevent selective grazing,
will increase grazing-hours to
the acre. If stock are stopped
from wandering back on the
grazed area regrowth will be
stronger and more vigorous.
On larger properties, where
beef-cattle are pastured, the
problem is different. But a
limited period on a paddock
of Rhodes, panic and lucerne
will bring better results than
allowing the paddock to be
grazed to the ground.
On alluvial soils forest
country and creek - flats—
lucerne is the best legume and
Rhodes-grass is not so satis-
factory, because it favors
scrub-soils. A mixture of
lucerne and green-panic has
generally proved successful,
though in the long run lucerne
tends to take-over—which is
not really a serious disadvan-
tage. As the central districts
often have periods of three
months or more without any
appreciable falls of rain, stands
of dry-land lucerne have to be
treated with respect. They
cannot be overgrazed, or weeds
will invade the stand,
Rotation of lucerne and
Rhodes-grass with cotton is
proving satisfactory in these
districts. A crop of grain fol-
lowing such a rotation also
helps to increase yield,

Livestock in Summer
“Aerogenes”: The effect of
heat on different kinds of live-
stock is of greater importance
to Australian farmers than is
perhaps generally realised.
For instance, the relation-
ship between coloring of
pigs and occurrence of sun-
scald; or, with cattle in the
north, the evidence indicat-
ing that Herefords with red
patches round the eyes are
much less damaged by heat and
glare than are those with the
orthodox solid white faces.
Cattle, too, suffer more from
heat if their coats are thick and
rough. The Zebu’s tolerance
of heat is due to its sleek coat
and large sweat-glands, which
keep it comparatively cool, and
these features are transmitted
strongly to its crossbred off-
spring.
All stock can be made more
comfortable, and consequently
more productive, if shade is
good and water plentiful and
cool. If stock have to be
watered in small troughs it is
best to have such troughs very
small, so they will be emptied
and re-filled too quickly to have
time to get hot.
American tests have shown
that dairy-cows suffer to the
extent of a. 10 per cent, drop
in production in a temperature
of 80 deg. F. with a humidity
of 65 per cent. At 90 deg., the
milk dropped one-third. Higher
relative humidity increased the
distress just as sharply. At 90
deg. or higher, the cows grazed
for only about 2 hours during
the day, but for 6\ hours during
the night. That wouldn’t help
them much if they were put
into the little dung-covered
night-paddock near the bails, so
that Bluey could find them
easily in the morning!
In the hot weather we could
help reduce the loss of produc-
tion due to heat by revising the
management of our paddocks,
so that the cows are on the best
grazing during the night, when
they feel more inclined to eat
the quantities they require.
Hogget Competitions
“Toison d’Or”: Hogget
competitions in South Australia
are doing a lot to help on
wool-production. This season
more than 50 events were
arranged by Merino and
Corriedale sheepmen.
Mundalla, in the Tatiara
district near Bordertown, was
the first branch of the Agri-
cultural Bureau in S.A. to
arrange such a competition.
From this beginning the idea
spread throughout the State.
Between June and September
competitions were run over a
wide area from Charra, beyond
Ceduna, on the Bight, to
Mount Gambier, in the south-
east.
The contests are usually
arranged by a special commit-
tee often drawn from the
executive of the local branch
of the bureau —another pecu-
liarly S.A. set-up. Judges are
selected from among stud-
breeders, leading commercial
men or officers of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture.
For the Merino events rules
are now standardised as a
result of planning by the
department and Merino Stud
Breeders’ Association. Depart-
ment officers do not judge at
events where sheep are of
mixed sex and they never
attempt to examine more than
eight entries in a day.
The scale of points gener-
ally accepted is: Growth, 15;
conformation, 10; standard
and uniformity, 15; wool-
quantity, 20; wool-quality,
15; density, 5; care and
attention, 5; freedom from
faults, 5; and remainder of
flock, 10 —to make a total
of 100.
In 1960 the penning of 20
per cent, of the flock in an
entry was usual, with this
year’s innovation of the yard-
ing of the rest of the hoggets
(mostly only ewes these days),
less 25 per cent, culling.
The competition is designed
to attract commercial breeders,
although some game stud-
masters enter, too. Ewe
hoggets, the future breeders,
are the ideal, instead of a
mixture of ewes and wethers,
with the consequent added
variations brought ■ 4

Queensland's
Veterinary Faculty
“Hop Scrub”: Queensland
still seems beyond the ken of
many Southerners, but “Vee’s”
notes (B. 31/8/ ’6O) on the
alleged shortage of vets show
more than even the usual lack
of information.
The Veterinary Faculty at
Queensland University was
established in 1936, with Pro-
fessor Seddon as its head. It
continued operations until
1940, when its undergraduates
left to join the Australian
forces. Those who returned
were able to complete their
degree courses in 1946. In that
year only the introductory cur-
riculum was covered, and
students finished their work at
Sydney University.
In 1950 the Faculty once
again started working at full
pressure. Present student-num-
bers are: Ist year, 55; 2nd
year, 45; 3rd year 35; 4th
year, 25; and sth year, 24.
During its operational periods
the Faculty has turned-out over
100 graduates who are now
working at research or teach-
ing, or are in extension-sections
of C.5.1.R.0., Agricultural De-
partments, and private practice
in all States and overseas.
The Faculty has its own farm
at Moggill about 10 miles from
Brisbane, and classrooms and
laboratories at Yerongpilly,
and may move out to St. Lucia
later this year. To extend prac-
tical work, specialised courses
in wool-technology and practi-
cal sheep-husbandry are held at
Gatton College, which has all
the necessary stock and facili-
ties.
“Vee’s” suggestion of a sort
of part-time study isn’t neces-
sary in Queensland, because
the Queensland Diploma in
Animal Husbandry (a three-
year course at Gatton) provides
a body of trained men who
move back to the sheep- and
cattle-stations, studs and dairy-
farms of the State, or join the
Department of Agriculture and
Stock to assist in animal-hus-
bandry extension - work under
the direction of qualified veter-
inarians holding university
degrees.
Further, Gatton College pro-
vides summer-vacation courses
for undergraduates in Agricul-
tural Science, Veterinary
Science, and Rural Science
from the Universities of
Queensland, Sydney and New
England. There were 31 at the
last course in practical farm-
ing and animal-husbandry. The
course is planned to allow
enough time, in rotation, at
each field-section and to cover
all operations.
Mudgee Fleece Show
Mudgee Legacy is organising
its third annual Fleece Show,
to be officially opened kt the
Technical College on Friday,
November 18, at 11 a.m.
The Show is to be a two-day
event, all information on which
can be obtained from J. C.
Stevenson, Fleece Show Secre-
tary ; Box 95, P. 0.; Mudgee,
N.S.W.
Farm Hint
“Bunda”: If fodder-supplies
have been depleted in the dry
spell, try a crop of grain-sor-
ghum. Even where summer
rainfall is unreliable, risking a
grain-sorghum crop is better
than doing nothing. At worst
some seed should be recovered,
but a good to excellent crop is
more likely, if you sow sound
and undamaged seed. Of
course, irrigate if possible.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(20/10/’60)
There should be good rains in many parts of Queens-
land during November, with light falls along the central
coast, on the Peninsula and in the North-western and far-
western districts. Best falls are likely along the south coast,
on the Darling Downs and about the Maranoa and Warrego.
Moderate to good rainfe are likely during December, with
light falls in western districts.
N.S.W. should have general rains in November, with
light falls in part of the far-western districts and best rain-
fall along the North Coast, on the Northern Tablelands, the
North-western Slopes and the nearby plains. Rainfall will
probably *vary from light to moderate in December, except
in northern districts, where good rains should continue.
Victoria should have moderate to good rains in
November, though poor falls are probable in part of the
Mallee and in central-northern districts. Best falls are likely
in the northern and central divisions. In December rainfall
is likely to be light. \
South Australia should have only light rain in
November, with better falls in part of the south-eastern
districts and along the west coast. Dry conditions may be
expected in December.
Light patchy rains are likely in Western Australia in
December, though much of the State should have good
storm-rains in December. Rainfall may be light in the
s.-w.-central north, and about the Fortescue and West
Gascoyne is likely to be dry.

Information Sought
Brief biographical outline of Sir
Charles Gavan Duffy ?
Duffy was born in Ireland in
1816 and began his career with a
Dublin newspaper, “The Morning
Register.” A fervent nationalist,
he founded the newspaper “Nation”
in 1842, and later published The
Ballad Poetry of Ireland, which
immediately proved very popular.
He became a member of the Irish
Confederation, and in July, 1848,
was arrested and tried for treason.
After the trial had been postponed
and the jury had disagreed several
times he was acquitted, and four
years later was elected to the House
of Commons.
Finding his compatriots less
zealous than himself, Duffy
resigned from Parliament and
emigrated to Australia. He was
met with great enthusiasm by his
compatriots in Australia and
Parkes offered him £800 a year to
write for the “Empire.” He decided
to stay in Melbourne and in 1856
was elected a member of the Legis-
lative Assembly. Almost at once
he proposed the appointment of a
select committee to consider the
subject of Federation. The com-
mittee duly reported, but the N. S.
Wales Parliament would not take-
up the question and nothing came
of it. In March, 1857, he took
office in the first O’Shannassy
Government as Minister of Public
Works, but when Parliament met a
few weeks later a vote of no-
confidence was immediately carried.
This was the first of a series of
appointments Duffy held in
O’Shannassy’s Ministries.
After a visit to Europe for two
years, Duffy was elected as member
for Dalhousie in 1867. He tried
once again to support Federation,
a Royal Commission being
appointed, but the subject was again
allowed to lapse. In 1871 he
became Premier and Chief Secre-
tary and had held office for 12
months when he was defeated by
the strength of prejudice on the
Irish question.
Three years later he returned to
England and was offered a seat
in the House of Commons, but
declined it and returned to Aus-
tralia to become member for North
Gippsland.
Elected Speaker in 1877, he
retired in 1880 and went to live
on the Riviera. Still interested in
the Irish question, the tactics of
the time displeased him and he
declined to nominate for Monaghan
in 1885 and 1892. He died in 1903.

Through the New York city
Tammany Hall the word Tammany
has enjoyed an unequalled associa-
tion with political corruption.
Where did the word come from
and did it have a similar connota-
tion originally ?
Just before the American revolu-
tion pro-George 111 groups formed
societies which they named after
St. George, St. Andrew and St.
David. In opposition to these,
revolutionaries formed their own
societies named the Sons of Liberty
and the Sons of St. Tammany.
Tammany was an Indian chief
noted for his wisdom and love of
liberty and was only “canonised”
in mockery of the opposition
institutions.
The Sons of St. Tammany were
dissolved upon the achievement of
independence. However, about a
fortnight after the establishment of
a National Government, a Society
of St. Tammany was formed which
represented middle-class opposi-
tion to the “landed aristocracy”
which were New York’s most
powerful group. But this society
remained independent of political
affiliation until 1798, when it sup-
ported the Republican (later the
Democratic) party. The society had
an important share in bringing a
about the election of Thomas
Jefferson as U.S. President in 1800.
Though politically affiliated it
remained free of any stigma until
its leaders had obtained municipal
office. There was opposition to
the idea of a private society having
a part in politics and the Tammany
Hall political organisation came
into being as a supposedly distinct
group.
Brief Answers
H.H.F.: Your bonds and shares
are classified as property. The
income from property is not taken
into account in calculating the
means as assessed, but the property
itself is. The pension rate (at
present) is reduced by £1 for every
£2O of property-value over £420.
(A new scale, to operate next year,
was explained in B. 7/9/’60.) The
income suggests that the property-
value would mean a considerable
drop in the pension-rate. The
amount of any mortgage or charge
on property is deducted from the
value of the property, but it is not
clear what interest you have in
the mortgage, and it seems likely
that you have an asset from which
you are deriving income. The
asset-value would have to be con-
sidered as a property component.
R.W.F.: You do not say what
kind of contribution you refer to,
but they will not have been over-
looked E.C.: A widow’s pen-
sion is not payable to a deserted
wife or divorcee who has not taken
reasonable action to obtain main-
tenance. .D.M.: In etching, the
needle scratches only through the
etching-ground and exposes the
surface of the plate, which is then
placed in a bath of acid. It is the
acid that eats out the copper to
lines deep enough to hold print-
ing-ink. But with drypoint, as
in line-engraving, the lines are
hollowed out by the tool itself in
direct contact with the copper.
W.T.: “Sapper’s” real name
was Herman Cyril McNeile, an
Army officer who wrote a few war-
novels and, when he had left the
Army, began his Bulldog Drum-
mond series... .P.A.W.: Lamington

are many words for a bowler,

But for all that it’s a disk with
a difference. When the stylus
explores the sound-track no
jolly choristers beef-out “The
First Noel” ; no boy-soprano
strains his pipes on “Away in a
Manger” ; no jazz-band goes to
town with “Jingle Bells.” In-
stead there are the tinkling
notes of an old - fashioned
musical - box bringing back
echoes of the Christmas before
Edison. A pleasant novelty,
though some of the echoes are
ring-ins—it must be the first
time “White Christmas” and
“Rudolph, the Red-nosed Rein-
deer” have been heard on a
musical-box.

Carols by Chorals
As a Camden “paperback”
R.C.A. has reissued Joy to the
World, a collection of carols
sung by the famous Robert
Shaw Chorale which quite early
in its career had the musical
accolade conferred on it in
the form of an invitation from
Toscanini to join him and the
N.B.C. Symphony Orchestra
in a performance of Beet-
hoven’s Ninth Symphony.
This carol-programme includes
all the usual traditional num-
bers as well as others less often
heard: “Patapan,” “My Danc-
ing Day/’ the Appalachian
folk-song “I Wonder as I
Wander,” the spiritual “Go
Tell It on the Mountain” and
the 15th-century “I Sing of a
Maiden.” The programme
ends with an old Welsh carol,
“Deck the Halls with Boughs
of Holly.”

Roughneck Rhapsody
Coronet’s recording of West
Side Story, the New York
street-gang musical which
opens next Saturday in Mel-
bourne, was reviewed in B.
7/9/’6O. R.C.A.’s offering in
this field is Dance Music from
West Side Story (16256)
described by Robert Russell
Bennett, who made the selec-
tions and conducted the Victor
Symphony Orchestra’s presen-
tation of them, as a concert
dance-suite. In this play much
of the action and atmosphere
is conveyed by dance-patterns,
quite apart from the mambos
and cha-chas of the Gym-
nasium dance-hall scene and
the ballet built around the song
“Somewhere.”
On the flip-side of the disk
Bennett leads the same orches-
tra through a symphonic
arrangement of Gershwin’s
“Porgy and Bess” music.
❖ ❖
Two Stereos
From R.C.A. come two disks
of music as wide apart as the
poles. The Music Of Victor
Herbert (SL 10926) contains a
dozen of the Irish-American
composer’s most luscious melo-
dies, all excerpts from his
operettas. They include “Ah!
Sweet Mystery of Life.”
“Italian Street Song,” “A Kiss
in the Dark,” “Gipsy Love-
song” and “I’m Falling in Love
with Someone.” And they’re
played by George'Melachrino
and his orchestra —which is
sufficient guarantee that
they’re played well. The
Music from M Squad (SL
10851) contains not only the
theme-tune of the TV crime-
drama series starring Lee
Marvin, but music which aims
to translate exciting action into
terms of notes and rhythms, in
which the brass section works
overtime. Not quite the same
as when it is allied to the visual,
but nevertheless it does capture
with reasonable faithfulness the
whistling-bullet-studded scene
of the gangland Chicago of the
bad days.
Chopin “Heavies”
Ben n o Moiseiwitsch has
made many records, not the
least being his seven tours of
Australia and that one is
likely to stand for a long time.
His latest, Chopin Recital, from
H.M.V. (CLP 1282), takes in
the Fantaisie-Impromptu—that
melodious piece from which
Tin Pan Alley tore the slow
section to make a senti-
mental song; two delicate
Nocturnes, Op. 62 No. 2 and
Op. 12, No. 2 ; and four of the
Pole’s weightier works, two
Scherzi and two Ballades.
The B-flat Minor Scherzo, the
most popular and most melodi-
ous of the four, has as its
running-mate the cheerful and
highly complex No. 4 in E
Major. The Ballades, a form
Chopin invented, are the
strongly dramatic A Flat Major
No. 3 and the tremendous No.
4 in F Minor, whose sombre
magnificence gives it strong
claims to be considered
Chopin’s masterpiece. There is
nothing in the playing of these
four epic works to indicate the
slightest slackening in the
powers of this veteran virtuoso-
pianist—in fact, the passage-
work and figurations are as
dazzling and fresh as anyone
could make ’em.


Women’s Letters
MELBOURNE
Seven members of one of the oldest
Red Cross branches Meredith, near
Ballarat —were among those awarded
long-service medals at a presentation at
Government House. Lady Brooks, who
is president of the Victorian Division
of Red Cross, presented the medals,
awarded for 20 years’ continuous service
to the society with bars for each addi-
tional 10 years. First of the Meredith
group so honored was Mrs. Henry Bolte,
wife of the Premier ; a member for 21
years, she was president of the branch
for 11 years and treasurer for 10. Others
were Mrs. E. Brady, Mrs. C. Mooney,
Mrs. M. Leverett, Mrs. J. Stafford, Miss
M. McNaughton and Miss Eileen Sellars.
Mrs. G. L. Chandler, wife of the Minister
for Agriculture and a member of the
Boronia branch, received a medal and
Miss Frances Metherall, of Hepburn,
received a medal and two bars in recog-
nition of her 46 years’ service. She helped
her mother form the Strathmerton branch
and became its secretary.

The Prime Minister and Dame Pattie
Menzies (she wearing a brilliant cerise
taffeta stole over her black theatre-frock)
were at the Princess Theatre for the
opening night of “West Side Story.” Mrs.
Garnet Carroll’s short frock of white
French re-embroidered cellophane-lace
had an iridescent sheen. Mrs. Bernard
Evans’s short frock and full-length coat
of honey-toned satin were patterned in
a white leaf-design. Mrs. John Howse
had a white ostrich-feather boa to go
with her short frock of peacock-blue
satin, which had frills around the hem
of the skirt. Mrs. John Faulkner’s short,
full frock was of apple-green taffeta.

Curtain-raiser to the Centenary Mel-
bourne Cup celebrations was the Black
and White Provincial Cup dinner-dance,
held at Ciro’s by the Your Opportunity
Committee to assist the Thornbury
Opportunity Youth Club. Huge bowls of
white flowers and a set of posters featur-
ing racing-motifs formed the decorations,
while on each table was a tall cardboard
horse with the table number on the
saddle-cloth. Committee-president Mrs.
Charles Davidson (whose lovely gown
was of corn-gold satin) with vice-presi-
dents Mrs. Leo Guest and Mrs. Wallace
Tresise, welcomed the official guests,
among whom were Opportunity Clubs
president Eugene Gorman, Q.C., chair-

was patterned in a deeper tone), and
Mr. and Mrs. A. G. Mcßae (Sydney).

There were about 1500 at the garden-
party given at Bishopscourt by Arch-
bishop and Mrs. Frank Woods, and
which was attended by the Governor and
Lady Brooks, the latter wearing a frock
and jacket of mist-blue re-embroidered
lace and a small cap of forget-me-nots
veiled in blue tulle. Mrs. Henry Bolte’s
carbon-blue silk frock was worn with a
small cap of daisies in two shades of
tulle. Ink-blue silk printed in black and
blue tonings and a short, cropped bolero
constituted the outfit worn by the Lady
Mayoress, Mrs. Bernard Evans.
Mrs. Peter Howson, who recently re-
turned from a visit to England with her
husband, the Federal member for Fawk-
ner, works for the Try Boys Society,
the Brookville Kindergarten, the Renown
Kindergarten and the Spastic Children’s
Society. She has a 13-month-old baby,
George.
Greenknowe, the Toorak home of Sir

and azaleas. Guests were welcomed by
ball - committee president Mrs. John
Hardie, vice-president Mrs. lan Miller
and hon. secretary Pamela Smith. Lady
Knox contrasted her pale-green French-
lace gown with a corsage of mauve
orchids. Jane Hill, who with her parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Norman Hill, is a house-
guest of Sir Robert and Lady Knox for
the Cup festivities, wore a lovely strap-
less gown fashioned of layers of fine
white Valenciennes lace, the wide skirt
banded with black velvet. Mrs. Peter

be gathered from the 1960 Men’s Wool
Style Show seen at the Australia during
the week. About 160 of Sydney’s best-
known businessmen went along to see
the show, which was put on by the Aus-
tralian Wool Bureau, and every one of
them looked pretty dapper. If anyone
was wearing a double-breasted suit he
must have crept away into the shadows,
because he was not to be seen. Federal
Treasurer Harold Holt represented the
Government, and wore his slip-on shoes
for the occasion, because Oscar
Schoeffler, the American fashion-expert
and guest-of-honor, had introduced them.
The styles shown were all very smooth.
Our men won’t be able to hold-out
against good style much longer. Olive-
green is the dominant color for the com-
ing season, and there’s a lot of brown
which is nearly black. In sports - wear,
shirts and ties, there is a beautiful
burnished gold color and a mustard that
ties-up well with burnt brown. Other
points of interest were narrower ties,
trimmer shirt-collars, hats with tapered
crowns and narrower brims.
Marea Stenmark is one of the three
producers of the Dominican Players
seventh revue, which is being presented
at Anzac House on November 9, 10 and
11. With Bernadette A lam and Helen
Bloomfield, Marea has written 26 sketches
for the revue, and her sister, Mrs. J.
McGlinchey, of Grafton, has contributed
one on “The Black and White Bore.”
The Dominican Players have been writing
and producing these revues for five years
now, and their lively wit has brought
them a large and devoted following. This
new production, “In the Dark,” has an
all-girl cast of eight and makes light-
hearted fun of topical and contemporary
events. Marea's photograph is by Norton
Trevaire.
A princess of the Romanys, Miss
Lavanya Petulengro, who was guest-
speaker at the Society of Women Writers’
luncheon during the week, cleared up
several fallacies about the gipsy people
during her talk. It was surprising to hear
that there is no such thing as gipsy-
music, for instance (“It is Russian,” said
Miss Petulengro); and that the theatrical
costumes, spangles, ear-rings, flouncing
skirts and so on, are just theatrical, for
the Romanys do not dress any differently
from anyone else. They do, however,
plunge their new-born babies into a dish
of cold water to produce that first yell
(“much better than slapping!”) and they
do retain their strange power over horses,
Miss Petulengro says that she herself can,
by whispering to a horse, persuade him
to follow her anywhere she wishes. This
is Miss Petulengro’s second visit to Aus-
tralia, and she leaves shortly for New
Zealand.

Australia has raised £750,000 for the
United Nations’ Refugee Year Appeal
and New Zealand £300,000. This won-
derful response to needs beyond their
own boundaries shows that the people
of Australasia are truly developing an
international outlook. This week cele-
brated the 15th anniversary of the U.N.
The result of this appeal alone should
hearten those who believe in its principles
and appreciate its work.


Darwin of heat, sin and mosquitoes or
this other, surprising Darwin with all
the modern amenities of international
war and espionage, this is the book to
go to. It is, indeed, an exceptionally
readable account of the place and none
the worse for the slightly pugnacious
style which Lockwood, like so many
other writers of the north, seems to
have had forced upon him —possibly
as a result of continually slapping at
the crocodiles.
Vance Palmer's Profiles
Vance Palmer’s National Portraits
has been reprinted (along with R. C.
Hutchinson’s Food for Longer Living)
as the first in a series of paperbacks
from University Press.
The virtues of “National Portraits”
are unspectacular and so may miss the
eye; yet when you dwell upon them
they are impressive. The style, while
fluent and sometimes poetic (“She
covered the plains one year with bones
and the next with flowers”) everywhere
subdues fine writing to information, as
is right for the occasion, and gives the
effect of persuasive conversation; some-
thing like Somerset Maugham’s, with-
out Maugham’s wicked polish. The
tone is temperate, liberal, civilised. In
its compactness and comprehensiveness
each short “profile” becomes a remark-
ably satisfactory biographical study,
and the series of compact studies makes
the book as a whole a very wide-
ranging survey of Australian achieve-
ment. There was no significant Aus-
tralian subject, it seems, on which
Vance Palmer could not talk interest-
ingly and intelligently.
Occasionally, as one would expect,
his quietness gets the better of
him; he was hardly equipped by
temperament to deal with so flam-
boyant a character as Kingsford Smith,
and, if his outline of the airman’s career
is satisfactory enough, nearly all color
and drama are missing from the
account of his flights.
Here and there, as in his essay on
the painter Buvelot, he seems uncer-
tain: it is not good enough to say that
Tom Roberts was “perhaps not a very
gifted painter.” And here and there, as
in the portrait of Henry Lawson, he
falls a victim to his subject or the
mood of the particular study: there is
no reason to take Lawson’s word for
it, which in any case is strongly contra-
dicted by “The Ghosts of Many Christ-
mases,” that Pipeclay Flat was “not a
place to stimulate a cheerful outlook
upon the world.” If there were
mullock-heaps, goats and rusty tins,
what better place could a small boy
ask to play in?
Nevertheless, the Lawson essay is one
of the best as a sketch of a personality,
and there will be few to dispute with
it as literary criticism; —
And so the last twenty years of
his life followed a descending curve.
After a couple of years in England
he returned to become a familiar
figure on the streets of Sydney—a
ghostlike figure in the busy throng,
deaf, abstracted, increasingly shaky.
The dark eyes, so luminous and
penetrating in LongstafFs portrait,
became glittery and Opaque, the
sensitive spirit took refuge behind a
challenging grin, the lean frame
relied for support on a stick... .But
his early work remains and holds
its own with any other in our litera-
ture for seriousness and purity. It
is no small thing for Australia that
the most popular writer of his day
should also have been its greatest
one. Lawson gave eyes to the people
who otherwise would never have
looked at the life around them with
penetration and understanding.
There are 25 studies of outstanding
Australians in the book: among them
Macarthur, Macquarie, Batman,
Parkes, Cardinal Moran, Farrer,
Deakin, J. F. Archibald, Monash,
Flynn and Chifley.
Michener on Hawaii
James A. Michener’s Hawaii (Seeker
and Warburg) is neither a great nor a
very profound novel; yet it would be
hard to think of another living Ameri-
can writer who could have brought it
off. Even on the purely technical level
it is an impressive performance to have
marshalled as many elements into a
narrative as Michener has done here;
but he has also made the narrative as
absorbing as it is huge.
It begins with a fanfare of popular
geological speculation—the prehistoric
birth of the islands through a volcanic
rupture in the floor of the Pacific—
then proceeds to describe in long, broad
strokes the coming of the four racial
groups whose interaction in marriage,
economics, politics and culture were to
produce the Hawaiian community of
today.
First comes a group of religious refu-
gees after an epic voyage by double-
canoe from Bora-Bora, a small island
near Tahiti, about 2000 miles to the
south; then, about a thousand years
later, in the 19th century, come the
Calvinist missionaries from New Eng-
land who, after converting the natives
as far as possible, form the great trad-
ing and planting families that hold the
islands in a tight commercial rule for
many years; and lastly, imported as
cheap labor for the plantations, come
the Chinese and Japanese peasants to
reinvigorate the inbred native stock by
intermarriage and, with monumental
industry and adaptability, force their

"Walk Along the Beach”
P poets, usually without being
yof it, have a “key-word” which
di; p perhaps all their lives or
jliponly while working-out one
■pi theme. Whether it is
“bubbling” or Shelley’s
if 'f >$ a clue to what is in their
jS thought or mood or music,
ipson’s favorite word in The
II Along the Beach (Edwards and
: '! is “frown”;—

:sj a sufficient indication of the
puzzled, rather sombre mood in which
he writes. He is, in fact, chiefly
puzzled and sombre about death, which
theme he celebrates in a dozen if not
more of the 45 poems in the book;
and this repetition of theme and mood,
coupled with his plain, unadventurous
technique, makes for a total effect of
monotony.
But ‘‘Night Out,” from which the
frowning quotation is taken, is an
amusing poem. In the title-poem,
“The Walk Along the Beach,” the
theme of puzzlement and doubt takes
on a strength which lifts it from the
merely depressing to the dramatic:—
He walks
Far out along the pier,
Amazed by dark and stars,
That hint of nothingness
Till he is numb with fear.
In a number of other poems, such as
his portraits of rabbiters and halfwits,
his circus-poem and his study of the
fat housewife whose life amounted to
“a doughy kind of bliss,” there is
human warmth, even a wintry humor,
to relieve the melancholy; and in the
poem about a quarrel, “Storm,” there
is strength again.
The book, then, is sturdy enough;
but more force and variety would be
welcome.

Reviewed Briefly
Official Secret: Clayton Hutton
(Max Parrish). War II memoirs of the
backroom-boy i.c. invention and dis-
tribution of escape-aids for British
p.-o.-ws. Following contemporary
“how-I-won-the-war” technique, and
not very well written, the book gives
most of the gen about magnetised
safety-razor blades, flybutton com-
passes and other toys. It’s all quite
interesting for anyone who likes to
explore the byways of modern war.

The Rome Escape Line: Sam Derry
(Harrap). True story of one of War
IPs most remarkable underground
organisations. The author, after twice
escaping from capture by the Germans,
set up a secret army of nearly 4000
other escaped p.-0.-ws. in Rome and
throughout German-occupied Italy.
The book tells how he managed to
organise the feeding, clothing and hous-
ing of these men under the very noses
of the Gestapo and the Italian Fascist
police. Well written and intensely
exciting.
* * * *
Curtain Up on South Africa: Garry
Allighan (Boardman). Objective
description of the present situation in
the Union, written by an experienced
journalist (who has worked there for
14 years) and former British M.P. The
influence of the Boer War on South
Africa’s development is shown in
correct perspective; opposing ideas of
Afrikaners, British and Bantus are
fairly examined; origins of the color-
problem are logically explained —it’s
interesting to note that the author traces
the beginnings of apartheid to Dr. John
Philip, a British missionary who was
chief adviser on Bantu affairs to Lord
Somerset, the first British Governor.
Well worth reading by anyone who
wants to keep abreast of events in
South Africa, the book is somewhat
marred by its provocative style.
