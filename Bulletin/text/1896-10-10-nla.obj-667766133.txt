The Local Muse .
Judged by her latest appearances, the local
Muse wants a tonic. She is anaemic, sallow, lack-
lustre : her pulse is feeble and her gait drags. The
sooner she is packed off to the mountains, with
instructions to some decent sanatorium-keeper to
give her three good meals a day, sunshiny walks,
and a pint of claret with her dinner, the better it
will be for her product. She has been “ letting
herself run down.”
*■'•••
Somebody met W. Shakespeare in Spiritland
the other night, and tendered the usual felici-
tations. The bard, who is as jocund, and
plethoric, and ruddy as of yore, and
has slightly accentuated the curve of his
long waistcoat, took tribute not unamiably, but
deprecated praise of his personal exploits. Said
the visitor: “ I have always been particularly
struck by the intellectual force necessary to create
Antony’s speech.” “Pardon me,” said Shake-
speare, “ but I did not write that speech.” “ Did
not write ‘ Friends, Romans, countrymen !’ ”
“No,” replied the dramatist with a smile, “that
was written by a magnificent haunch of venison
of my acquaintance, with the assistance of twin
quarts of unusually fragrant Alicant.” “ Indeed !
but at least, sir, the airy extravagance of
1 The Tempest ’ sprang from no such gross diet
—that dainty fragment of Ariel’s ” “ Was
born from the fumes of a pottle of sack I
had at Shrewsbury,” interrupted the poet, medi-
tatively caressing his paunch. “What! your
songs, your sonnets- —?” “As to the songs, I
cannot be certain ; but the sonnets are distinctly
not mine. They were the work of some very fine
old ale on which I got drunk every night at an
Eastcheap tavern during my second London
season, after gorging myself from a splendid sir-
loin. I invariably woke up warm and poetical
—rbeshrew me ! the knave has run for it! ”
* * * •
This interview is but one of a thousand testi-
monies that literature rests upon a beefsteak
basis, and no poetry ever came out of a pump.
For energetic intellectual achievement you must
have a brain swollen with rich blood, and you
can’t make rich blood out of pap and cabbages.
The upholders of the Cabbage theory of existence
invariably argue to Duration, and point out how
nice it is to be a noodle and live to ninety. But
the need of literature is Intensity—we want
thrilling lines, not dull volumes. Or they argue
to Size, and point out what fine large animals are
the elephant, and the horse, and the cow—who
live on grain and grass and clothes-line. They
ave large—and so tame ! Unluckily for the Cab-
bage-men, we want wildness, not tameness in
literature—the lion’s roar, the tiger’s spring, not
the bleat and waddle of the sheep. Literature
cries for concentration, and to get concentrated
mental force you must have concentrated physical
pabulum.

It looks as if the local Muse had been browsing
off turnip-tops lately, with occasional reference to
a stick of asparagus. She is so flat, and stale,
and unprofitable. Per medium of E. L. Scharkie
she issues “Fragments, Poems ” whioh show that
ohe poor lady has grown too weak to think—she
is light - headed, and babbles fine - language
incoherently. The words look as if they might
mean something; but, O Muse, what is it? E.g.,
page 28 :
SONNET,
“If I could fly ” ; but says the sage you’ve got
No wings so there’s an end of it. In sooth,
The Socialist, chiselling with wilful thought,
Would build a better pyramid of Truth,
Composite without atom, and in his dreams
Would fly like I would, but he has no wings
So there’s an end of it. Doctrine, false-lipped*
Vesting all life in instant good, empowers
No hideous wrong desoend, no good evolve, —
Heights, whioh nor form nor method can dissolve
But by blood on the soul, as drop, gaunt cliffs,
Piecemeal, to ever-sapping waves, and towers
Rear up to aggregate completing themes,
The making, and the breaking laws of things.
This form of the sonnet, by the way, does not ap-
pear to have been known to the Italian masters,
but the bold uncertainty of its rhymes needs no
defence. Only—the purport ? “By blood on
the soul ” is obviously a new and handy expletive;
but what is “ empowers no hideous wrong des-
cend ” ? why cannot “ form nor method dissolve ”?
and why do “towers rear up to aggregate com-
pleting themes’’? A sheet of foolscap will be
presented to the solver.
* * * *
E. L. Seharkie seems to have made a long list of
“poetical” words and phrases like “twilight,”
“amber,” “empanoplied,” “dappling,” and so
forth, and deliberately set sitnself to alliterate
them in lines not too particular about their feet.
This is a fairer sample of sis labor :
Sunset pillowing longing in its anus,
Twilight tingling clown the slopes of time^
Peaceful waters waving out their charms,
Anther ripples of eternal rhyme,
Clear image of Eternity, sweet rest,
Down in the golden harbour of the west.
If the mind moves half-way to welcome them,
these lines might be called pretty : that is to say,
the disconnected images have a flavor which titil-
lates the fancy. They represent the extremity of
E. L. Scharkie’s art. Se threads ser words as a
child threads colored beads : sometimes the com-
bination harmonises, but ’tis only a string of
colored beads when all is done.
* * • •
The author of “Perdita, a Sonnet Record,”
modestly suppresses his name, but he is plainly
Tomlinson.
“This I have read in a book,” he said, “and that was
told to me,
And this I have thought that another man thought of a
Prince in Muscovy.”
There is not one impressive look-like-original
thought in his whole sheaf of thirty sonnets. Oc-
casionally there is fairly dexterous expression of
an attractive fancy, as in
CUPID AND PSYCHE.
Thus did the ancient artist-soul arrest
A perfect thought and model it for me,
A truth in stone, to face eternity.
Lips turned to lips they stand, and breast to breast;
The fingers of his right hand lightly rest
On her dear cheek, his left hand lovingly
Holding her head—so stand they, he and she—
Her arms about his naked body pressed.
These are the gods I worship, even these,
The body and soul of Nature ; girl and boy
For ever young ; I fall upon my knees
And worship them. Pure life without alloy 1
Spirit and flesh made one ; and so each frees
The other. Perfect Love and perfect Joy 1
This has some grace of conception, but Tomlinson
has not vigor enough to fill even 14 lines. He has
to eke his thought out with pad-phrases like “ he
and she,” “even these,” which do not advance
the idea one whit, and with forceless repetitions
like “ I fall upon my knees and worship them.”
The result is flat: there is no vitality, no dynamic
force in it. You muse at the climax: “Hm !
where did I see that before ? ” and pass on unin-
fluenced.
* * * *
And this is Tomlinson’s best. “Worship the
body and soul of Nature!” Nob ho; he never
comes within a long cooey of Nature. He wor-
ships the literary images of somebody else who
may possibly have worshipped Nature, and stews
them into his book at second or third or fourth or
fifth-hand. Here is his very first sonnet: —
LOVE, THE HUNTER.
The hart that wanders, where thick shade relieves
The summer heat, beneath the interlaced
Delight of flickering frondage, and hath paced
Anieh the hunter’s camp, too late perceives
His risk ; and, spent at last, his flanks he heaves
By springs whose waves are bitter to the taste.
But all his mournful passage may be traced
By ruddy splashes on the grass and leaves.
So marking well each sonnet may ye know
Which way my soul in travail flees, and where
It finds brief rest, and how it hears the flow
Of soft or thunderous waters, but must bear
The clinging pain for ever, though it creep
Out to the edges of the endless deep.
Isn’t it an abomination of bloodlessness? Where
did Tomlinson get that hart? Chaucer ? Spenser ?
Lord knows—but it isn’t his own. Why should
Australian writers ransack ancient pastorals for
weary tropes when they have their own new con-
tinent —original, bewildering, charming—right
under their foolish noses ? And Tomlinson wor-
ships the body and soul of Nature, quotha !
* * * *
So throughout his flat batch of rhymes—mere
echoes laboriously caught from the writings of
bards who looked out of their own eyes, and
thought their own thoughts, and invented their
own images for sedulous Tomlinsons to copy.
When an angel comes to visit Tomlinson
In her hand she bare
Two cups, one filled with Rhenish bright and rare—
Why not Chateau Wr.nghnu? And beneath
Perdita’s breast “ was burnt the muzzled bear”—
who danced in the villages of the Middle Ages.
Why not a possum? Certainly, Australian litera-
ture should not be fettered by the limits of
Australia : it should be universal, and it has a
right to draw its material from any source it
pleases. But a writer who observes and thinks
for himself in Australia cannot avoid giving his
work an Australian tinge, and when the Austra-
lian Tomlinsons come along with ideas and figures
culled, not from life, but from books, we know
they have not been observing and thinking for
themselves, and justly curse them for worthless
wordspinners.—Now take the local Muse away.
The American Short Story.
Somebody sends four pages of an American periodioa
America, containing an article by Maurice Thompson o
the American short story. In reinforces the opinion her
frequently expressed that the short story of the America
magazine is, in the cant literary phrase, “thin.” Th
fiction of Harper’s, and Scribner’s, and The Century
either a colourless photograph of commonplace scene
and people, or an intricate play of tedious trivialities—
Henry James in extremis—glimmering vaguely lilt
summer lightning, never startling with a zigzag flash
Mr. Thompson tells why.
The magazines control the trend of literary tast
and the scope of dramatic invention in fiction, anc
the magazines are controlled, in a large degree, b;
men who measure everything by the urban stan
dard of taste. Now the fact is that the extra
urban influence is the preservative of the true
dramatic vision, the conservator of invention, o
lyric purity, of forthright expression.
. -And for this reason, one imagines: that the urban stat
is at present an unnatural state ; it enfevers the mind
warps the nerves, blunts the sensations, demoralises the
judgement. In the country the atmosphere is clear fo
mind and body: the mental reaction to the stimuli o
literature is quicker, juster, and stronger.
The result is that we Americans who write
short stories are the worst handicapped authors
earth. There are two fields open to us : dialeo
U* ew England or negro) and croquet-party sketch
Everything.else is forbidden. If we dare venture
on dramatic vigor or imaginary freedom, as
Shakespeare did, our MSS. are countersigned
“ sensational ” and returned to us. Eliminate the
free handling of unholy passion from the French
short story and there yet remains a residuum oi
powerful fiction, picturesque, startingly dramatic,
novel, original, told with close, fine economy oi
phrasing and with a sumptuous expenditure oi
imagination. Such a story-literature cannot exist
in America, because the magazines of America are
not in sympathy with it.
It does not exist in Australia, because our population is
small ar.d our writers are still learning how to handle
their tools. A few of The Bulletin short stories are
things to be proud of, but there are not enough of them
to constitute “a story-literature.” Wait a while.
While all of our best critics admit that the
French short story is the best that is written, our
magazines will not publish short stories written on
the French model by Americans. For example,
no American magazine would print such a story
as “The Ghost,” by Guy de Maupassant, or one
of the “Letters from My Will,” by Alphonse
Daudet, to say nothing of the far more dramatic
stories, by other French authors, continually
appearing in the Parisian journals. Of course, I
do not refer to stories whose moral tone is ob-
jectionable. I make bold to say that if Poe’s
“ William Wilson,” or his “Fall of the House of
Usher,” or his “Gold Bug” were now first
written and offered to an American magazine,
there are ten chances to one that it would be de-
clined out of hand as being sensational. And yet,
when do we see a story comparable in value to one
of these in any of our monthly journals?
True. And again, looking at home, it is admitted with
some contrition that if Poo’s “ Fall of the House of
Usher” were now first written and offered to The Bulle-
tin it would probably be returned with a suggestion to
cut it down one-half and omit the introduction. But
what would you have ? The Bulletin is The Bulletin—
that is to say, it is not a magazine. It cannot do every-
thing : it does what it can. (Wanted : an Australian
magazine.)
A mere character sketch is not to be properly
called a short story, at least, not in the sense
contemplated in my discussion. The best pro-
ductions of the French short-story writers are
condensed dramas ; now a tragedy, then a comedy,
anon a farce ; but in every case the substance and
essentials of outright drama are present. A local
study, no matter how picturesque, is not a short-
story. It may be good as a bucolic bit of color,
or as a glimpse of out-of-the-way life; but if the
invention, the dramatic organism, the story, in
short, is not there, there is no vital fiction. Style
cannot do everything. It is substance that sus-
tains ; the story must have a body; a living,
active, symmetrical body. This is not all; it
must have the independence, the individuality,
the novelty, the surprise-power of original drama-
tic art, which is the soul of creation, especially
when the fiction must be generated with the
strictest economy of materials. The American
short story wants this inner force.
Points that The Bulletin has insisted on over and over
again.—And, finally, could it be guessed that this article
of Thompson’s was penned as long ago as 1890? Except
that the dialect-story has rather less vogue, its comments
are just as true to-day.

Flowers from, Omar’s Garland,
[Omar Khayydm (Omar the Tent-maker) was a Persian
poet and astronomer, who died in 1123 at a good age.
There are several translations of the 400 or 500 Arabio
stanzas attributed to him—that of Edward Fitzgerald
(1809-83) dwarfing all others for English-speaking people.
Fitzgerald’s final edition collects 101 stanzas distilling the
essence of Omar's philosophy—that of Solomon, Horace,
Rabelais—and impregnating or completing it with Fitz-
gerald’s own thought and imagery. “The melancholy
riohness of the rolling quatrain with its unicorn rhymes,
the quaint mixture of faroe and solemnity, passion and
playfulness, the abundance of the imagery, the power of
the thought, the seduction of the rhetoric, make the
poem actually, though not original or English, one of the
greatest of English poems.”—Saintsbury.]
I sometimes think that never blows so red
The Rose as where some buried Caesar bled ;
That every Hyacinth the Garden wears
Dropt in her lap from some once lovely Head*
And this reviving Herb whose tender Green
Fledges the River-Lip on which we lean—
Ah, lean upon it lightly ! for who knows
From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen !
Ah, fill the Cup what boots it to repeat
How Time is slipping underneath our Feet:
Unborn To-morrow, and dead Yesterday,
Why fret about them if To-day be sweet!
A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,
A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread—and Thon
Beside me singing in the Wilderness—
Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow 1
Why, be this Juice the growth of God, who dare
Blaspheme the twisted tendril as a Snare?
A Blessing, we should use it, should we not?
And if a Curse—why, then, Who set it there?
And much as Wine has play’d the Infidel,
And robb’d me of my Robe of Honor—Well,
I wonder often what the Vintners buy
One half so precious as the stuff they sell.'
Oh, threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise 1
One thing at least is certain— This Life flies;
One thing is certain and the rest is Lies :
The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.
Strange, is it not? that of the myriads who
Before us pass’d the door of Darkness through.
Not one returns to tell us of the Road,
Which to discover we must travel too.
I sent my soul through the Invisible,
Some letter of that After-life to spell;
And by and by my Soul return’d to me,
And answer’d “ I Myself am Heav’n and Hell” r
Heav’n but the Vision of fulfill’d Desire
And Hell the Shadow from a Soul on fire,
Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves,
So late emerged from, shall so soon ex-pirn
Yesterday This Day’s Madness did prepare ;
Tomorrow's Silence, Triumph, or Despair :
Drink ! for you know not whence you came, nor
why :
Drink ! for you know not why you go, nor where.
Myself when young did eagerly frequent'
Doctor and Saint, and heard great argument
About it and about :—but evermore
Came out by the same door where in I went.
With them the seed of Wisdom did I sow,
And with mine own hands wrought to make it
grow ;
And this was all the Harvest that I reap’d—
“l came like Water, and like Wind I go.”
Into this Universe, and Why not knowing
Nor Whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing;
And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,
I know not Whither, willy-nilly blowing.
Then to the Lip of this poor earthen Urn
I lean’d, the Seoret of my Life to learn :
And Lip to Lip it murmur’d—“ While you live,
Drink I —for once dead, you never shall return.”
And fear not lest Existence closing your
Account, and mine, should know the like no more;
The Eternal Sifkl from that Bowl has pour’d
Millions of Bubbles like us, and will pour.
Oh, Thou, who Man of baser Eartb didst make,
And ev’n with Paradise devise the Snake :
For all the Sin wherewith the Face of Man
Is blacken’d —Man’s forgiveness give—and take!
Some for the Glories of this World ; and some
Sigh for the Prophet’s Paradise to come ;
Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go,
Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum !


Medical.
COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RABIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently I he diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing I hat for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, exp • ctorating blond and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I be -ante,
as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
in nts. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S. W.”
‘ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-

undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”— Signed

Dr. Gibbons
Having completed his New and Centrallv-situated
Electrical & Consulting Rooms
Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends
and Patients at
137 Elizabeth-street, SYDNEY.
Dr. GIIBBOKTS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Sc SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing' symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fuliness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILIT Y,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. "in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.

A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances,
prescribes Mercury in any form.

X_, E A FM
When you go out shopping, consider, think
of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-
tation in the form of a pretty show ; there is
B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and C,
who says that he is the man for your money ;
and so on, throughout a list as long as
George-street, each smiling dealer has some-
thing to say and to offer.
Please Pause!
Hearken not to the song of the syren, sing
she ever so sweetly ; heed not the voice of
the charmer, charm he never so wisely.
Your pocket’s concerned; and there are
pirates about. As the poet pertinently puts
it: “There be land-sharks and water-
sharks,” and it is for you to see that your
dealings are with none of these voracious
monsters. Take warning in time, for it will
be no use when the new taxes come round —
and the tax-gatherer won’t take no for an
answer—for you to plead : There would have
been enough and to spare had I been wise

And that is why other Houses, who appeal to the
Public for Trade, and emphasise QUAUIIY,

never quote PRICE. They say —“ What is the
good of our quoting prices, when JOHN HUN lER
is selling so-and-so half-a-crown lower than we can
afford to sell it?” This is why I always quote
prices. I know lam selling at lower prices than

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
AWAY BEYOND THE BELT OF BLUE.
Away across the line of trees,
Away beyond the belt of blue,
There is a city high with spires,
Wide fields there are that streams run through.
Sometimes I think I see the spires
And hear a mighty city’s stir ;
And some I smell the sweet of fields
Drowned under drifts of wattle-burr.
But when I smell the sweet of fields,
Or when I hear the city’s voice,
A dimness trembles on my sight,
My soul seems driven to a choice
Between those two aerial lands —
One wrought in marble’s noble hue,
Carven and chased past earthly art,
And reared against a heav’nlier blue;
And one low-lying, simple, slow,
Stretched out past reach of shore or sea,
A limitless, low-lying world,
Where silence reigns eternally.
With every wind the wattle lies
In golden velvet on the fields.
Our earth weaves golden wattle-webs,
But none the gold that this world yields.
And always in the morning sweet,
And sweeter still at noon, at night.
With no too closely-woven shade,
And no too brightly-beating light.
The silence is the sweetest thing,
The silent dawn, the silent day;
A sleep might last a century;
The birds that sing, sing far away.
And O, the clover in the fields !
O, white magnolia on the air !
The sweetest flowers from every land
Grow all together sweetly there.
Or is the space the sweetest thing ?
The rolling, green, unending plains,
The paddocks starred with dandelions,
The dreamy, verdant, English lanes.
My soul seems driven to a choice
Between these two aerial lands—
The simple, silent world of fields,
The City built by artist hands.
The City’s soul knows rarer life,
And greater dreams and deeds than here,
And I was ever one for dreams,
Longed ever in great deeds to share.
And underneath those cupolas
It may be that the poets dwell . . .
But O, the silence of those fields !
And O, the meadow’s endless swell!
So every eve the struggle wakes.
The years go on : not yet I know
If, when I pass I choose my place,
To which of these my soul would go.
LOUISE MACK.
IF DEATH SHOULD COME.
If Death should come before me on a day
To pilot me across the river gray,
(Should I not weep : “ Behold, he beckoneth !
Alas ! O Death ! ”
And shudder and draw backward at his breath,
And with a sudden pallor and despair
Cry to my gods to spare
This trembling life ?
And all the sorrow of the wasted years
And torture of unconsummated hope,
And purpose unfulfilled,
Mixed with the menace of some awful change,
Encompass me ?
Yet why?
Has not the splendor of sweet summer days
Eloated thro’ all my blood ?
The tinted dream of mountain, sky and tree,
Low velvet valleys where slow rivers wind,
And granite forelands barren to the storm,
And cold, still, snowy peaks ;
Thunder of waves, and slumber of the sea
When like a yellow lamp the moon hangs low ;
Fierce whirl and riot of cities,
And the corroding calm of pastoral peace ?
Have I not known all that a man may know—
Triumph, despair, joy, grief, hate, happiness,
The smile of treachery, proved friendship’s hand?
Been humbled to the dust and risen again
And triumphed in my turn, and fallen oft ?
Have I not worn the crown and felt the thorn
Of true love's tenderness and lust’s remorse;
And by a subtle alchemy dissolved
The crust of things and laid the kernel bare ?
What then so darkly daunts?
Ah God ! it is the loneliness, the breath
Of mightier ethers,
The unspeakable vast horror of the void,
That chills the soul,
Trembling within the solemn ante-room
Of Power Supreme !

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1896.
Some More Jubilee.
A few days ago Queen Victoria put up a
record as the British sovereign with the
longest reign recorded within the period of
moderately unreliable history. Away back
in the misty early-Saxon times there is al-
leged to have been a monarch of even greater
duration. But in the general uncertainty as
to whether the Saxons really were not Swedes,
and whether there were any Saxons at all, it
seems to be generally agreed to drop him out
and say no more about him. Therefore, Vic-
toria is held to have broken all past British
records in her own particular line of industry,
and the circumstance has been allowed to
pass with such very scant notice that The
Bulletin begins to wonder if the great art
of Grovel is really dying out. The occasion
just gone by was a much greater one than
the royal jubilee of some ten years ago—
jubilees at the best are common and ordinary ;
but the difference in Australian public senti-
ment over the two events was remarkable.
On the jubilee occasion Sydney threatened
to burst into riot. The great congratulatory
meeting at the Exhibition Building was
packed with Freemasons, footballers, prize-
fighters, Primrose Leaguers, sailors,'police,
alleged troops, and swarms of miscellaneous
loyalists. More troops waited outside, ready
to rush in and drown the insurrection in
blood if necessary. The famous address to
the alleged “ Pre-eminent in Grief ” came to
light on this occasion. The seven provinces
were full of jubilee literature written in the
spirit of one who goes down on all-fours and
bumps his head against the dust in honor of
his little tin deity. Three Primrose Leaguers
called round at The Bulletin office with
sticks to assault somebody for not taking a
proper view of the matter, but thought
better of it and went away without doing any
damage. It was a great occasion of glare
and gas and whoop and victuals and illumina-
tion and bad poetry, and everybody read
loyal addresses to everybody else, and Sydney
flowed with beer and excitement and exhor-
tation. /
♦ * * *
Looking back on that wild episode of less
than ten years ago it looks practically impos-
sible. On the present occasion, it is true,
Victoria requested that the public and
official riot should be postponed till the end
of the sixtieth year of her reign. But so
far as Australia was concerned there was
practically nothing to postpone. Unofficial
grovel was allowed to an unlimited extent,
but the public was apathetic. Except that
President Zeal, of the Victorian House of
48 Rich Landlords, gave some kind of enter-
tainment to his fellow fossils, and the party
went to the theatre afterwards, nothing
worth speaking of happened, or seemed as if
it had the slightest desire to happen. There
is no Primrose League now, and Tanker-
ville Bennet, of that wondrous organisation,
rages in the press about the beastly dis-
loyalty of Australia no longer. No aggres-
sive British person calls up at this office now
and wants to fight the staff for want of
respect to J. Bull and the “Crown.” On
the day when Victoria put up her great re-
cord of placid longevity and mild continuous-
ness hardly anybody even wrote to the
papers about it in an enthusiastic strain. A
few leading articles appeared here and there,
but they were mere weak platitudes and
figures. Also, one or two municipal councils
talked of sending addresses, and the dirt-
colored ferry-boat in Sydney Harbor had a flag
hying, and that was about all. There was so
little general interest in the event that when
a Bulletin paragraph badly misplaced the
date of it, no one noticed the mistake with
sufficient energy to write about it. For
these and other reasons it would seem that
the great art of grovel is by no means what
it was in Australia.
/ * * * *
Probably the steady increase in the num-
bers of the native-born population is wearing
out the active spirit of loyalty. No com-
munity can take an active interest for ever
in a very ordinary-looking person whom it
never saw, and is never likely to see, and
who, if she was seen, would look very much
like any other ordinary-looking person. The
percentage of the population which has ever
been within less than 10,000 miles range of
the Throne is steadily diminishing, and
loyalty at 10,000 miles range is a very much
strained emotion. In former days God and
Victoria and the Bunyip were the three
great abstractions of this country, and the
same fading away of interest is perceptible as
regards all three. The Bunyip is dropping
out of local mythology because he refuses to
turn up and keep himself in evidence.
Victoria also doesn’t turn up, and long
absence has created a popular feeling that
she really doesn’t matter. And as for the
common Deity of nineteenth-century com-
merce, absence and the collection - plate
and the doings of His alleged priests
and a growing suspicion that He isn’t
anything like the Deity of the New Testa-
ment teachings are gradually dropping him
also into oblivion. The latter-day hustle
for sordid bread and meat, too, has done a
lot to wreck Australia’s loyalty. Ten years
ago, in the jubilee days, this.country was
still young and garish and could spare
the time and energy to go out and
howl over mere abstractions. The banks
hadn’t gone broke then, and the borrowed
money was still rolling in gaily, and both
N.S. Wales and Victoria had their booms in
full blast, and there was work (paid for, more
or less directly, with borrowed money) for
nearly everybody. There was no Labor
Bureau then, no sand-shifting jobs, no
pauper relief in the shape of scrub-cutting on
the desolate Bogan, no land-tax or income-
tax or deficit. Wool-prices were high, and
the average payment for making a pair of
slop pants was nearly three times what it
now is, and the Public Service hadn’t been
retrenched, and the populations of Sydney
and Melbourne hadn’t started to diminish,
and the Public Works policy was a steady
source of employment, and generally things
were different. Now Australia has suddenly
grown very old, and tired, and poor, and
doesn’t go out in its old volatile fashion to
yell from pure lightness of heart. The gene-
ral feeling is that loyalty isn’t victuals, and
Victoria isn’t boots, or clothes, or ready
money, and this pretty accurately expresses
one great reason why there is no more jubilee
in the land, and probably never will be.
* * * *
It is an open question whether Australian
republicanism also is quite as strong a senti-
ment as it was ten years ago. A great part
of it—the aggressive, brick-thro wing part—
was simply an expression of disgust at the
crawlsome spirit of loyalty and the “ Pre-emi-
nent in Grief ” variety of literature, and a
well-founded desire to kick that objectionable
sentiment hard. Nowadays there is little
very conspicuous loyalty to kick, and the
“Pre-eminent in Grief” species of litera-
ture has almost wholly ceased to vex the
land, and the Primrose League, as already
mentioned, is defunct. The lowest stratum
of republicanism is like the lowest stratum
of anything else. One glaring variety of
Protestantism, for instance, would die a
natural death if there were no Catholics left
to infuriate with its yellow banner on the
12th of July, and in like manner one section
[of Australian republicanism dropped out of
;sight to a great extent when the frantic
loyalism of ten years ago became ingloriously
defunct for want of sufficient interest in
itself to keep itself alive. The Throne and
Person are not objected to in Australia with
quite the old vigor of language, because there
is an increasing tendency to forget that such
things exist. A continued study of the
British papers seems even to suggest
that John Bull doesn’t grovel with
quite his old abundant worminess, and
in this theory, doubtful as it is, there
seems to be some slight, hope for better
thing in the future. If a constitutional
monarchy like that of Britain could exist
absolutely without the element of grovel,
then The Bulletin might possibly give up
preaching republicanism. The British sove-
reign, being almost entirely devoid of political
authority, can do no harm, in a purely poli-
tical sense, that is worth mentioning. She
permanently and peacefully stops a hole
through which the cold blast of party politics
would otherwise blow. She saves the worry
of periodically electing a State figurehead,
and though the hereditary principle is
supremely ridiculous, yet if the nation
chooses to let a person be born into a certain
position merely to save the dust which would
arise through other people rushing for it,
the idea w r ould do well enough until a per-
manent steam monarch could be invented.
So far, however, the curse of monarchy has
been that it led a large section of the com-
munity to go on all-fours, and rub its head
in the dust by way of abject abasement, and
write bad prose and awful poetry, and it
has given rise to the National Anathema and
other horrors. And though there are hopes
that the dog-like part of the British nation
isn’t so abjectly horizontal as it was, still
there is little reliable data to go upon so far.
* * * *
Whether the increasing lack of interest in
the British monarch and monarchy will
hasten or retard the arrival of Australian
independence it is difficult to say. There
are apparently far fewer people in this
country who would exert themselves violently
to maintain the British connection than
there were ten years ago, and it is possible
there are also fewer who take enough inter-
est in it to object to it very much. It
requires a certain amount of interest to be
actively hostile, and there are comparatively
few signs of that interest at present. The
Bulletin sometimes imagines that a time
will come when the mass of Australians will
not really be aware that there is any British
monarch at all. They used to be kept
aware of the fact by the daily papers and
by much National Anthem and by jubilees
and birthday celebrations and the like ; but
the Anthem is a great deal less virulent
than it was, and the jubilee business is appa-
rently played out, and the press, to suit the
taste of its readers, enthuses in a minor key
and often drops the subject altogether.
Even The Bulletin notices just here that
it often forgets Victoria's existence for six
issues at a stretch. Possibly a time may
come when the monarchy will gently and un-
consciously cease to exist because one sove-
reign will die and the nation will quite forget
to crown another one. The fact that the
British monarchy will cease to exist some
day may be taken for granted, as everything
ceases to exist some day, and this ending
appears, in the present trend of things, to
be as probable as any other. f
The Law and the Regulations.
At Albury Circuit Court Mr. Justice Simpson
had the courage to state his views on the sub-
ject of solitary confinement. Fortunately his
Honor has not been giving expression to mere
sentimental objections ; he asserts that he had
an opportunity of observing the working of the
solitary confinement system, and that no one
unacquainted with the treatment can realise
the mental suffering prisoners must undergo.
The Bulletin wishes that all Judges adminis-
tering the criminal law would follow Judge
Simpson’s example, and make themselves
acquainted with the effect of the draconian
sentences imposed by them with such airy
liberality.
♦ * * £
One of the worst features of the N.S. W.
penal system is the secrecy which surrounds
the administration of the prisons. Strange
stories of the iniquitous way in which prisoners
are treated now and then reach the public ear,
only, however, to be contradicted by some frog-
blooded official from his place in Parliament;
and a credulous House and an apathetic public
unreservedly accept the denial. The N.S. W.
criminal code is a century behind civilisation.
The traditions of Botany Bay still cling to us ;
all N.S.W.’s penal laws are overshadowed by
the triangles and the gallows.
* * * *
A prisoner, sentenced to three years im-
prisonment, is doomed to pass nine months in
solitary confinement—an addition to his sen-
tence brutal in the extreme. Wheuce comes
the authority for inflicting this torture? In
vain is the N.S. W. statute-book appealed to for
an answer. The only hint given is in the Gaols
Act, which provides for the Governor-in-
Coundl making regulations for the conduct of
prisons, and, given that authority, a merciless
Executive has fixed this solitary confinement as
an incident of all long periods of imprisonment ! !
One Act alone deals directly with the subject—
the Criminal Law Amendment Act—which, in
this instance, falls far below its monotonous
level of brutal cruelty, and becomes almost
humane. Sec. 398 provides that in awarding
imprisonment, the court may direct the offender
to be kept in solitary confinement for any por-
tion, or portions, of the term “ not exceeding
one month at a time, and not exceeding three
months within any year.” That is, no Judge,
even of the Supreme Court, in sentencing a
prisoner, can inflict anything like the period of
solitary confinement to which every long-sen-
tence prisoner is subjected bv the gaol regula-
tions !
* * * *
Judge Simpson, like everyone else who has
really considered the question, doubts very
much if solitary confinement ever does any
good. He further says that in future, except
in the worst form of cases, he will not impose
sentences that will carry with them solitary
confinement. When a native-born Supreme
Court Judge speaks like this, it affords hope
that N.S. Wales may, in a few years, shake off
her convict-forged fetters. The Bulletin
would suggest that next time Judge Simpson
feels compelled to impose more than three years
imprisonment, he should fix, in the sentence,
the terms of “ solitary ” to be served ; then, in
the event of the gaol authorities attempting to
enforce their savage regulations, the prisoner
and his friends will be able to test their validity
in the Supreme Court.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Johnson on Language.
Whittingdale Johnson, a well-known Sydney
magistrate, took it upon him the other day to
summarily repeal a great part of the law against
obscene language, and, considering the possible
consequences of his high-handed action, The
Bulletin invites the Government to seriously
consider Mr. Johnson. The trouble began with
a policeman arresting a man for using particu-
larly gamey language in the street. Consider-
ing that there is probably more loathsome
language in the streets of Sydney than in any
other city of its size, and that there are few
places in it where you can hear less than three
curses and one unpublishable expression at
once, and that the average policeman simply
wanders by and lets them curse, and that the
law against obscene language is next door to a
dead letter (partly because policemen won’t
arrest offenders, and chiefly because a ridicu-
lously incompetent magistracy does practically
nothing to them when they are arrested) —con-
sidering all these things, it would seem that
this policeman was a little more deserving than
the average. Magistrate Johnson, however,
actually sat on him heavily for his attempt to
enforce the law—as follows (Sydney D.T. re-
port) :
At this point the magistrate asked the constable whether
there were any persons within hearing who were likely to
have been shocked by the language complained of. The
constable could give no proof to this effect, whereupon
the magistrate remarked that he could not deal with the
case under the Vagrant Act. The language, he said, was
the normal language of some people, and he seldom
passed a group of laboring men without hearing similar
expressions. So long as they were not used in the pres-
ence of females or other persons likely to be shocked by
them the police had no right to interfere. He was con
tinually endeavoring to instruct the police in their duties
in this respect, but it seemed useless.
The Bulletin regretfully records its opinion
just here that Magistrate Johnson seems even
more useless than his attempts at instructing
the police. The law distinctly prohibits ob-
scene language in public places, without any
reference to whether the people within hearing
were likely to be shocked or not. The theory
that it is perfectly allowable unless the people
who have to listen to it are prepared to go into
court and swear that they were shocked i?
practically a license to everybody to be as dis-
gusting as he pleases, seeing that very few
people can afford the time to follow up the
offender in the police-courts, or care for the
publicity it involves. In the present case the
policeman had to listen to the language, and so
had the inhabitants of any adjacent houses,
and according to the Johnson theory these
people must go on hearing it indefinitely. No
doubt the great Australian adjective and other
things are the “normal language of some
people,” just as burglary is the normal occupa-
tion of some other people ; it is so largely
because the police and the Johnson variety of
magistrate fail so disgracefully j n their duty.
But the fact that there is much cursing in the
streets doesn’t make cursing legal or pleasant
or beautiful, any more than the fact that there
is much dirt makes dirt any cleaner, or the fact
that there is much embezzlement makes em-
bezzlement any the more honest,and the factthat
there is much cursing is no reason why there
should be more cursing. The moral aspect of the
case may not affect Mr. Johnson, but the legal
aspect certainly does. And the legal aspect is
that the law makes obscenity and profanity in
public places distinctly punishable ; that the
police and Mr. Johnson are both paid by the
country to enforce the law as it stands; and
that Mr. Johnson absolutely refused in this
case to enforce the law, and practically ordered
the police not to enforce it either. In other
words, he instructed the police to let obscene
language, under certain circumstances, which
are of frequent occurrence, fill the air with im-
punity, and, because it is already bad, he holds
that it is a good thing to let it remain bad or
grow worse. And the country doesn’t pay Mr.
Johnson his salary that he may, directly or
indirectly, encourage obscene language under
any circumstances whatever.
Freetrade and Japs. : the Doom of the
White Cabinet Maker.
Dear Bulletin, —Knowing that the Australian
must earn a decent wage to live, and being
desirous of convincing him of the Freetrade
error, I give you an idea of how Freetrade
suits the clever Jap. In the cabinet-trade
Sydney and Melbourne are overrun with
Chinese, and the white man (even with steam
appliances) finds that the Chow is too clever
for him. Now, the Jap. has not yet had to be
reckoned with ; here is a sample of his skill
A 4ft. 6in. oval 100 table, best Italian walnut
veneer, inlaid marquetrie centre—with outer
strings of willow, and carved edge moulding-
deep and bold ; four pillar and claw pedestal
beautifully turned and carved out of Italian
walnut. The claws carved clean and bold on
cap, toe and sides, centre drop ornaments,
castored and well polished (not varnished, but
properly rubbed), landed in any port free-on-
wharf to Australia, 50s.—a total eclipse of even
the white slave who hawks his goods in London
on a Friday night and, because he can’t procure
a purchaser, pawns them for half their value.
Again, a Chippendale whatnot, beautifully
enamelled, five plate-glass bevels in back, clean,
well-cut, handsome pattern fret work—a centre
cabinet, glass door, side shelves, square turned,
work both novel and rare, 6ft. Jin. high by
4ft. 3in. wide, f.0.w., Australia, 375., honestly
worth under the hammer in Sydney, £7.
This would be worth £4 unpolished in
London. A music-stool with patent screw,
five-inch pillar—fluted and carved—three claws
beautifully carved, twelve-inch top, carved
rim, upholstered in hair, well-sewn edge, stiff
and strong, covered in morocco—not skivers—
and buttoned down and well polished, f.0.w.,
Australia, 11s. —worth in London 165., un-

polished and not upholstered. A high-low
suite of frames complete, comprising six small
chairs, balloon backs, cabriole legs, beautifully
made with iron cleats over every joint, prettily
carved —one lady’s chair, one gent’s chair, and
one six-foot-six high-low couch one mass of
bold, deep, beautifully-relieved carvings—
stuffing bars out of red wood quite as strong as
the beech used in English work ; the whole
suite of nine pieces, unpolished, £B. They
much resemble the Italian frames Rittenberg
used to import and never sold for less than £lB
per suite. These goods are to be dumped on
the Australian market in ship-loads, and the
controlling power is now journeying all over
the principal cities of Australia. Will Premier
Reid please digest this and ask himself—How
are any cabinet-makers, turners, upholsterers,
carvers and polishers to compete against
these clever Japs. ? They simply can-
not compete and will starve, and yet in the
face of such truths daily being told the solid
grafter has to submit and be driven out of his
own market by preventible aliens —too strong
for the slaves of Curtain-road, London. —

The "Ass” on Manly Independence.
Liberty, the Sydney organ of the National Ass,
denounces the Old Age Pension idea and insidi-
ously attacks the noble quality of Thrift —the
thing Fat Man gets an extra vote for —in the
rear, as follows :
The latest move is that to provide a system of old-age
pensions. It is impossible to speak in sufficiently strong
terms of deprecation of this proposal. It is one of the
most dangerous, because most insidious, attacks upon the
quality of manly independence which has raised the
British people to their proud ascendancy amongst the
nations, and this colony in particular to its present strong
position. Nothing could more clearly demonstrate the
weakness of moral fibre which is gradually but surely
pervading the public spirit of the colony than the fact
that a body of presumedly intelligent men are prepared
to recommend the adoption of a system of State pensions.
Evidently the beautiful virtue of Thrift has
suddenly fallen to a heavy discount. Thrift
consists largely in the individual putting away
money to support him in his old age. Under
the Old Age Pension scheme the individual pro-
poses to do this ; only, instead of putting money
in the bank run by the National Ass person
and letting him fool it away (as he did in the
cases of the Federal Bank, City of Melb. ditto,
the Mercantile, Real Estate, Commercial of
S.A., Bank of S.A., Van Diemen’s Land, Bank
of Queensland, Bank of Australia, Town and
Country, Bank of Port Phillip, Oriental, Bank
of Tasmania, and several dozen more) it is pro-
posed to put the savings in charge of the State,
where there seems reason to believe they will
be moderately safe. The individual will tax
himself to provide the money, and will receive
it back again under certain fixed conditions im-
posed on himself by himself, and thus he pro-
poses to teach himself on a large scale the vir-
tues of thrift, foresight, self-denial, and other
beautiful things which the National Ass has
strongly commended until now. The only
aspect in which the matter is not one of mere
■thrift and self-denial is that the first batch of
annuitants —those who are already qualified
—will not have put up the funds them-
selves, but will be provided for by the rest
of the population. These people don’t
demand the charity which it is proposed to
extend to them; they are far too few to
make any demand that can be heard at the
polls, or to bring any pressure to bear on Par-
liament, or otherwise to influence the matter in
any way. A very large proportion of them are
itinerant derelicts who haven’t even votes, and
if they all had votes they wouldn’t amount to a
circumstance. If the Old Age Pension scheme
is adopted it must be because the people who
have to pay for the pensions are in favor of it,
and these people propose to pay, not only to
establish a fund for their own old age when
they get there, but also for the derelicts who
are past paying—the social wrecks and paupers
and outcasts left over from the good old days
of “ manly independence ” that the Ass organ
laments about. This is a beautiful example of
charity as well as thrift. Also it has a manly
independence of its own. The present genera-
tion is beginning to decide that, instead of
going on in the ancient way which the National
Ass approves of, and, if disaster comes upon
them, living on alms in their old age, they will
begin now to make provision for the future by
their own act, at their own expense. And if
that doesn’t come under the head of manly in-
dependence—well, what is the meaning of the
term ?
The Vested Interest in Crime.
Speaking recently at a political meeting, in the
Sydney Protestant Hall, W. P. Crick, lawyer
and legislator, frankly declared that he could
advocate Protection without being accused of
self-interest, as all he wanted was a good crop
of criminals every year. This naive statement
makes one pause and reflect on the enormous
vested interest there is in crime and general
human frailty. The average man talks as if
employment per se were the supreme object to
be attained, and, under existing conditions, he
dreads anything likely to diminish the number
of billets, however much good it might do the
community at large. We all wonder why it is
that conditions seemingly calculated to make
people criminals are allowed to continue from
year to year ; but just think what would happen
if the supply of law-breakers ceased ! There
would be no more openings in the “ foorce ” for
the raw-boned “Moikes” and “ Tugalds,”
there would be retrenchment amongst gaolers
and turnkeys, the West Macquarie pet
and his fellows in the Devil’s brigade could
no longer gain laurels (and fees) by restoring
the burglar or pickpocket to his friends and his
relations, and the proprietors and distributors
of the evening papers would find a lamentable
falling-off in their circulation. The contractors
who supply the prisons would have a reduced
custom, and the flourishing industry of building
new gaols and court-houses in every one-horse
township would receive a severe check. If the
Prohibitionists had their way, what would be-
come of the dividends of the brewing companies
or the monopoly values of the hotel properties ?
If social purity prevailed, how could the saintly
landlord get liis fancy rents for houses now oc-
cupied by the daughters of joy ? Let the
betting-house and the tote be suppressed and
Rachel would weep for her starving hook-
nosed offspring. Vice and crime are a great
local industry and must be maintained at all
hazards, otherwise many worthy and unworthy
people will have to join the unemployed.
To avert such a catastrophe let us fill
our legislatures with lawyers to prevent
the making of better laws or to so mangle such
as are passed that there will ensue an endless
supply of court cases and appeals whereby the
legal sharks may wax fat on the litigants’ sub-
stance. Let employers pay inadequate salaries
to those who hold responsible positions and
they will thus multiply embezzlers. Allow the
publican to vend the vilest fire-water unchecked
to madden the thirsty citizen into crime or
lunacy. Let us continue to associate first
offenders with hardened gaol-birds. Let the
police shepherd the discharged convict and run
him in as a suspect ere he can possibly get work
to do. Let every seedily-attired man about
the streets be arrested for the alleged crime of
being poor. Let promotion in the police
depend on the number of convictions obtained.
It is to be feared that a long time will elapse
ere the extensive and influential vested interest
in a “ good crop of criminals ” is much inter-
fered with through the efforts of the whole
body of social reformers.
The Parson Who Blabbed.
Archdeacon Piddington, a Church of England
cleric, is chaplain of Tam worth Gaol, N.S.W.
In the course of his ministrations to prisoners
he recently interviewed two brothers named
Dederer, charged with murdering an Indian
hawker. They were rough, unlettered men—
wild growths of the wild bush, never brought
into contact with humanising or civilising in-
fluences. Of religion they were as ignorant as
of most other things, but they seem to have had
that instinctive faith in the supernatural which
is the attribute of undeveloped intellect in indi-
viduals and races. They were no more Church
of Englanders, apparently, than they were
Parsees or Muggletonians, but were handed over
to the Church of England in accordance with
the local official tradition which credits to that
organisation waifs unclaimed by other creeds.
To them came Archdeacon Piddington, invested
with all the sanctity of the priestly office, repre-
sented as the intercessor with heaven, the embodi-
ment of virtue on earth. This priest questioned
these prisoners about the crime imputed to
them, and exhorted them to tell him the whole
truth. Then, solemnly: “Now, which of you
killed the hawker?” “ I did,” said one. The
trial came on. Archdeacon Piddington got
into the witness-box. “ That man, one of the
prisoners, told me he killed the hawker.” And,
partly on this evidence (at any rate after it), the
brothers were found guilty and sentenced to
death. Did Mr. Piddington use any per-
suasion to get the confession out ? He says he
only offered them “a moral and religious in-
ducement ? ” But did he explicitly tell them
what might be the consequence of yielding to
this moral and religious inducement? Did he
caution them that “ whatever you may say will
be used in evidence against you at the trial ? ”
Did he say point blank : “ What you tell me as
a priest I’m going to swear against you as a
witness. If you tell the truth, you may
possibly go to Heaven, but you will almost
certainly hang ? ” Or did he induce them to
confess on pious grounds altogether, omitting
to give them notice that he intended to blab
the confession on the grounds of exalted
citizenship ? On these points, so far, Arch-
deacon Piddington, as reported in the daily
papers, is not clear. But even admitting that,
once the Archdeacon had acquired knowledge of
the Dederers’ guilt, he should divulge it in
the interests of the community—-admitting this,
which no priest of the R.C. Church would
admit for a moment in the circumstances—why
should he acquire it to the Dederers’ injury ?
Archdeacon Piddington has bruited it to the
world that a doctor, a lawyer, can keep a pro-
fessional secret, a priest of the R.C. faith can
die rather than reveal the confidences of the
confessional, but a Church of England parson—
well, The Bulletin believes that Archdeacon
Piddington will yet be ready to admit that he
has done his Church an inexpressibly grievous
wrong.

The Convict Butler.
“H.T.C.” to The Bulletin :
Re the convict Butler. “ P’leeceman X” has left a gap
or two in his interesting letter. I lived in Dunedin
when Butler first burgled and got four years. In
addition to stealing a gold chalice from the R.C.
bishop, he burgled a leading jeweller. The plunder never
came to light. Shortly after the completion of his sentence,
the residence of the detective who arrested him was found
in flames, and the same night the Crown-Prosecutor’s
house was burgled; while the police were hot on the scent,
the Dewar tragedy takes place. Butler is traced to a
suburban hotel, where, while waiting for breakfast,
he plays selections of mass music on the piano. The
waitress, a Catholic, pauses in, her work and enters the
room. The music was l2th Mass and on each
page was stamped “P. P. Moran, St. Joseph’s.” The
Crown received the evidence of the waitress in the trial
for murder as highly important. The murder took place
at about 5 a.m. or a little after. Butler was at the hotel
between six and seven. Though she was subjected to a
searching examination the girl’s evidence only amounted
to identification of the Bishop’s music. When arrested,
Butler was at Waikouaiti, about eight miles from Dun-
edin. A pair of field-glasses found on him had the name
“ Stamper ” inscribed on a sliver plate, the name of
the prosecuting barrister at his first trial, whose house,
only a day or two previous, he had burglariously
entered. s.s to the motive for the Dewar murder, the
theory was generally accepted that Nellie Dewar, who
was engaged to Butler when he started his four years’
sentence, was entrusted with the jewellery he had
acquired by burglary. Before he was released she mar-
ried, and this and the fact that his old flame would not
hand over the proceeds of his former robberies incited
him to vengeance. It was proved at the trial that
drawers and boxes were emptied of their contents, which
were strewn all over the place. This was the popular
theory. The populace was much disgusted at Butler’s
acquittal on the murder charge, and it was only by a ruse
that he was conveyed safely that night from court to
gaol.
Queen Victoria last week put up the record
reign in British history (over 59 years), and she
is now lighting out in pursuit of Louis XlV.’s
famous French record of 72 years. London
Telegraph called for plans and specifications
for a great national rejoicing to celebrate the
event, and the following list (by the Evening
News’s London correspondent) contains the
principal suggestions sent in :
A volunteer review. All London, even the tiniest
streets, courts, groves, and alleys, to be illuminated. Two
celebrations, one “finite,” one “infinite.” The “finite”
general rejoicing, the “infinite” a national holiday.
Everybody to get their wages. A big bonus to be given
to encourage weak-kneed British youth to join the “first
line of defence.” The gift to the Queen by the nation of
a mansion, to be absolutely her own. The collection of a
charitable fund, to be called “ Queen Victoria’s Boon.” A
revising of the words of the National Anthem, which are
denounced as “ doggerel.” An annual bank-holiday, to
be called “ Victoria’s Day,” and to be observed for ever.
An issue of gold and silver coinage, to be offered to the
public at double its face-value, the profit to be given
to the poor. The passing of an Act of Parliament
making it a criminal offence to pay a woman less
than 2s. for a day’s work of twelve hours. That
the pay of soldiers should be raised to that of police and
firemen. All the board school children of England to
have a picnic and a medal. The city to present a golden
casket to the Queen. A special commemoration Bible to
be published. A History of the reign of Queen Victoria
—bound in morocco, and profusely illustrated, to be pub-
lished at 6d. That Her Majesty be humbly entreated to
sit for her portrait to a British painter. That, all deserv-
ing indigent persons of 77 years be “ set up” for the rest
of their days. A huge illuminated cyclists’ parade. That
thAevent be celebrated by building cottage homes for
and giving pensions to those who can work no more. That
“ God Save the Queen ” be played and sung simul-
taneously all over Great Britain, her colonies and depen-
dencies at noon precisely (Greenwich time), September
23. That on that day all theatres and music-halls be
thrown open free. That “homes” be built and endowed
for “ poor children by the sea.” That London should be
encircled with an open space a mile wide, to be called
“ Victoria’s belt.” The establishment of a central “sus-
tentation fund” for the “ half-starved clergy.” That all
the London theatres should present a Shakesperian play
for this night only, admission free ; programmes (illumin-
ated) gratis. That a new arrangement of the laws
take place, to be called “ The Code Victoria.”
That widows in workhouses of the age of 77
be withdrawn from there and placed in alms-
houses specially constructed for them. That each
board school child in the land receive a mug, a Bible,
a bag of bulls’-eyes, a portrait of her Majesty, an
orange, and a history of her reign. That a “History of
the Reign of Victoria ” illustrated, with a portrait of her
Majesty, be presented to every person in the United
Kingdom free. (Bradford regrets it cannot make a sug-
gestion at present, as the town clerk is just dead.) The
publication daily in the morning papers of a portion of
the Holy Scriptures, “ in plain, eveiyday language.” The
culminating suggestion was that “ her Majesty should lay
the first stone of a memorial chapel to her own memory,
said chapel to be erected as near as possible in West-
minster Abbey.”
Truly John Bull and his wife don’t know how
to rejoice. What England really wants on
such an occasion is a universal drunk and a
general dog-fight, and every man to have the
privilege, for one night only, to wallop his
“missus” within reasonable limits, also the
passing of an Act of Parliament by which
Britain annexes every place, and the proceed-
ings to finish with an international cricket-
match in which England makes 18,000 runs.
Magistrate Johnson, of Sydney, has instructed
the police from the bench that obscene language
is to be permitted unless it is used in the
Eresence of people who are likely to be shocked
y it. How is a policeman to recognise a
person who is likely to be shocked ? Pre-
sumably by his black coat and his tall bell-
topper. Mr. Johnson discharged the obscene
person brought before him, because it couldn’t
be proved that people likely to be shocked
were present. As the language was used after
11 p.m., presumably the people in the adjacent
houses couldn’t come out and state that they
disliked the language because they hadn’t their
clothes on. The Johnson variety of logic
admits of unlimited cursing in the hearing of a
person who is in bed, or is in a bath, or is
afraid to come out and state his or her objec-
tions for fear of worse language or road-
metal, or in the hearing of children who are too
young to have any distinct views on the matter,
or of anybody who is afraid of being “ stoushed ”
afterwards. Also, it gives the offender abund-
ant time to get away while the policeman is
trying to find out if he has been heard by any-
body who is likely to object. Most people who
don’t object to obscenity are in that state
simply because they are used to it, and they
are used to it simply because they have to hear
it, and they have to hear it because the police
and Johnson are disgracefully lax in their duty.
And, as Johnson facilitates cursing because
they are used to it already, they will necessarily
keep on being used to it, and therefore they
will keep on not objecting. The logic of John-
son works in a circle.
Queensland, which was announced a week or
two ago as having passed the Federation Bill,
all save the formality of the Governor’s
sanction, has managed to get that measure tied
in a hard knot at the last moment, after all.
The Assembly refuses to let the people elect
delegates, and insists on appointing them it-
self. The Council demands a voice in the
appointment —in other words, it wants part of
the steal—and the result is a deadlock. The
Westralian Government also has quite unex-
pectedly resolved to move in the matter, and
the Federation Bill has been introduced in the
Perth Legislature. Therefore, with Queensland
not yet arrived, and with a chance of Westralia
arriving later on, there is something to be said
for Premier Reid’s policy of waiting a little
longer before fixing a date for the election of
delegates. On the other hand, it might be just
as well for Australia in the end if Queensland
and Westralia were not there at the beginning
of the Federation. The other four provinces
would probably fix up a much more democratic
Federal Constitution without them, and then if
the two outsiders wanted to come in afterwards
they would have to accept the ready-made
Constitution or none at all. And the chances
are that the pressure of circumstances would
compel them to come in. Still, for the sake
of preserving the Federal spirit—what there is
of it —it is impossible to rush on the elections
for the express purpose of preventing Queens-
land and Westralia having a say in drafting the
Constitution, therefore the logic of events goes
to prove that Premier Reid is right.
The recent Yic. Leg. Council vacancy for the
North-West Province —said vacancy being only
brought about by the fact that the fossil who
previously represented the district refused to
go back —was a fine example of the incurable-
ness of Victoria’s unpaid Council. The N.W.
Province covers about one-fifth of the country,
so the reasons why there were only two candi-
dates were pretty numerous. AnM.L.C., as is
well-known, must have an income of £lOO a
year from land, therefore he must be a very
considerable landowner. Out of its handful of
Fat Men, therefore, this constituency, if it
was to have a contest at all, had to find two
with the requisite income from land, with
enough leisure to spend a great part of their
time in Melbourne, enough money to keep them
there without payment for their legislative
services (this meant that the qualifica-
tion was really an independent income of
<£soo or £6OO a year at the very least), enough
ready cash to canvass the huge constituency
where railways are few and travelling very
costly, and enough energy or a big enough axe
to grind to make it worth while going in for the
business. Under these disadvantages the dis-
trict raised just two dull, orthodox Tories, with
the requisite qualifications —men who said that
the Council should continue to exist because its
advantages were “obvious”—and Pharez
Phillips was elected. Phillips said that he
believed in “political rest;” and the other
candidate was of the same view. Nobody
could find a candidate with the requisite quali-
fications who believed in motion, for the suffi-
cient reason that when a man gets rich enough
to qualify for the House of 48 Rich Landlords
he is generally so tired that motion makes him
feel bad in his stummick.
♦
Melb. Age cheerfully relates that a young man
named Callender, convicted on a charge of
tampering with a nine-year-old girl, was
brought into the flogging-room at Pentridge
last week to receive 15 lashes. “The culprit,
however, had not got the physical courage to
face the music. He no sooner beheld the
triangles and the flagellator with his coat off
and a bandana encircling his head and the cords
in his hands for tricing him up than he trem-
bled in every fibre of his body, and went off in
a dead faint. The doctor in attendance care-
fully diagnosed the physical condition of the
prisoner, and owing to his representation it was
deemed desirable to postpone the punishment.
In these cases, of course, the date of the post-
ponement cannot be fixed definitely.” And so,
for the present the Law is employed in tuning
Callender up to concert-pitch, that he may
be able to face the music of the “ cat” at the
earliest possible date. The fact that he can’t
contemplate the prospect of fifteen lashes
with equanimity makes Callender a difficult
subject to build up, but the Law hopes that,
with the aid of tonics, it will succeed in bring-
ing off the flogging at next attempt. If Cal-
lender faints again at the sight of the triangles
and the flagellator’s shirt-sleeves and the ban-
dana handkerchief for absorbing brow-sweat,
he will have to endure further strychnine and
beef-tea, and another long dose of mental
agony whilst undergoing a third preparation
for his gory engagement. And when the Law
has completed its contract—as it certainly will,
if Callender doesn’t faint to death in the
meantime—the sexual lunatic will go back into
the world and tamper with little girls as before.
His brain-disease having been aggravated by
the cat-cure, he will, naturally, become a more
rabid tamperer than ever. That’s all.
Several N.S.W. legislators express them-
selves in favor of M.’sP. being allowed to
frank all their official correspondence, and
it is understood that a scheme to effect
this is now under consideration. No doubt
it is often a tax on a member to have to
pay postage on certain official letters, and
as there are gabby letter-writers as well as
gabby talkers the outlay in postage-stamps
must be sometimes very considerable. Yet this
franking onslaught should be repulsed. Are
members to be believed when they say they will
frank only official correspondence ? The case
pivots here. “ Address the book to the Earl of
Ross,” wrote the amiable Maria Edgeworth
to Crofton Croker in the old English frank-
ing days. “ Put an inside cover on addressed
to me. The Earl will tear off the outside cover
and then frank the book on to me.” The Earl
and Maria were as honest as the average
N.S.W. member.
Superintendent Sadlier, of the Victorian
police, reports that, in his opinion, the proviso
contained in the Infant Life Protection Act,
compelling nurses to keep a record of the names
and addresses of the mothers of children com-
mitted to their care, conduces to the abandon-
ment of illegitimate children, owing to the
record being open to inspection by visitors, and
the mothers’ consequent dread that their frailty
will be published. One can mentally see a
roach-backed Social Gimlet female with an
ill-fitting dress and a libidinous smirk gloating
over the record, and then departing to harry
the unfortunate mothers for further particulars.
And the way of a girl who has loved too well,
and her lover, who have fallen into the hands
of the aforesaid female, is indeed rough. Mrs.
Grundy, when she opposes a Foundling Hos-
pital where a child could be left without the
slightest chance of anyone discovering the
identity of its mother, instigates the wholesale
murder of little children.
It is notorious that the legal persecution con-
demned by Judge Coffey at Darlinghurst
sessions last week is regularly employed by
corporations and private employers against
embezzling employes, and will only be sup-
pressed by Judges keeping their eyes open and
boldly refusing to act as accomplices in the
scheme. “It savours of persecution,” said
Judge Coffey, “ when a man who has em-
bezzled a large sum of money is brought before
a magistrate on a charge of embezzling a por-
tion of the general deficiency, and after he has
been punished on that charge to proceed against
him on a charge of embezzling another portion
of the general deficiency.” In several cases
the conduct of prosecutors has amounted
to the compounding of felonies. When a clerk
embezzles £lOO, for instance, his employer
threatens to have him prosecuted for £2O.
When the embezzler’s friends rake up £2O and
hand it over, the employer goes for another
£2O, and so on. And over and over the Courts
have lent a blind sanction to such proceedings.

somewhat attenuated comedy skeleton
is “ Mrs. Ponderburv’s Past,” which owes a good
deal more to the Sydney Criterion co. than to its
adapter, Burnand the man who omits the good
things from London Punch at a large annual
salary the noticeably weak part about “Mrs.
1 onderbury is that the lady hasn’t any Past
worth mentioning. She is a fierce boss-female
with a miserably crumpled husband, and the first
act finds this crushed he-worm locked up in a
room under orders to write out 200 charity cir-
culars, as a punishment for being found possessed
of a comic song with an undress female on the
cover. He is harried in various ways through
three acts, just as he has been harried for the pre-
vious 20 years, but the real horror of his existence
comes in when he has to tell the story—which he
has been telling more or less all his married life—
°f how Mrs. Ponderbury, in her youthful days,
routed with a fruit-knife and great slaughter a
wicked male person who climbed up the balcony.
The fruit-knife with which she did the deed hangs
in the drawing-room, and Ponderbury is periodi-
cally stood up in a pained attitude to explain the
matter and illustrate it with appropriate convul-
sions. The knife is the secret of the lady’s
power; her slave feels it is no good resisting a
woman like that. But at the very lowest ebb of
his fortunes, when he has been found in a room
along with an actress dressed mainly in long hair
and a wrapper, and has been discovered doing a
song and dance with the same person, and has
vainly tried to suicide by rushing through a two-
storey window, and has been sentenced to two
years’ confinement and continuous jaw in an un-
lettable house on a sand-hill, relief comes unex-
pectedly. A nautical person irrupts' rather awk-
wardly into the story and explains that he was
the man who climbed the balcony 20 years ago.
Also, he wasn’t routed with the fruit-knife, but
hugged Mrs. Ponderbury considerably, and found
her an ordinary weak woman who was quite wil-
ling* to hug’ back. Then it dawns on Ponderbury
that the woman he has grovelled to so long is only
a bogey after all, and he revolts, and dashes the
fruit-knife on the floor, and confiscates the key of
the front door, and sentences his broken-down
tyrant to write out charitable circulars herself till
further orders, but lets her out under the First
Offenders Act on the understanding that she
thereafter goes reverently on all fours and is
always ready on the carpet to be stepped upon at
the shortest notice. There is so very little Past
about the affair, however, that the lady’s utter
downfall doesn’t look reasonable. Her natural
policy would be to suppress the insurrection and
make Ponderbury write out 2000 circulars, but in-
stead of adopting this course she goes to pieces like
a house built of eggs.
* * * *
The play hangs almost wholly on Mr. and
Mrs. Brough as the two Ponderburys. Brough’s
male Ponderbury is one of the best things that
accomplished artist has done. Mrs. Brough has
comparatively few opportunities, her part being
mostly glare and monotonous ferocity, but she
makes the she-Ponderbury about as good as she
reasonably could be. The only other person of
note is a giddy music-hall lady who shows a great
amount of the upper part of herself at various
cnse.s. Miss Temple does this character in a
cheerful, off-hand fashion, and the upper part of
her is plump and white and altogether pic-
turesque. The rest are mostly outlines. The
pretty Miss Hardy has little to do, and Miss
litheradge still less. Five other people do hardly
anything but drift across the stage, and a mildly
unsatisfactory painter, who stays longer than the
rest, wouldn’t be missed if he drifted likewise.
An individual like a terrified curate looks at one
time as if he was going to do something, but
thinks better of it. If arrangements could be
made for him to really do the thing which he once
or twice looks as if he was going to attempt it
might possibly strengthen the play somewhat.

That old English comedy, “The Rivals,”
was staged at Sydney Lyceum last Saturday
night, in the presence of an unusually attenuated
audience. Possibly Sydney rushes after the
lady rather than the gentleman variety of
star, and Miss Elliot’s large, florid, copious
style of beauty and rather commonplace acting
don t appeal to it. Possibly it doesn’t care
for the old English style of comedy. Possibly it
thinks that old English comedy and a bran-new
Amurnkin accent don’t go well together. Still
except as regards Goodwin himself, the accent has
been so suppressed as to be hardly perceptible, and
though that gentleman’s voice is the modern voice
of Broadway, N’York, attired in the tight pants
and steeple-hat of England in the last century or
some other part of the indefinite past, still his Bob
Acres is an eminently successful character all
through. The only drawback worth mentioning
is that Nat Goodwin has the misfortune to look
not old by effluxion of time so much as born
°ld but, despite this and his accent, the gorgeous
coat and the tight pants, and the conical hat and
the part generally sit well upon him. Clarence
Handyside makes a very fine and rampant and
inflamed Anthony Absolute ; and Miss Gertrude
Elliots Lucy is nearly perfect. Sister Gertrude
has large, eloquent eyes and an expressionful
countenance, and a cheerful way of dancing
through her part which is very charming ; also
she seems to have a lot of artistic ability—at all
events everything she has yet done in Sydney has
been done remarkably well. There is room, also,
to say many kind things about the Malaprop of
Miss Estelle Mortimer, and the usually rather
gradual and heavy-going beauty-actress shows a
little more than her ordinary animation.
• * *
u Altogether the coldness with which the
Rivals’ was received isn’t wholly justifiable,
the fun of that ancient comedy was never very
vigorous according to modern ideas, and in the
new version a play that was formerly too long has
been cut down till it is quite shore enough, if not
a little too short. It belongs to an age when the
English people took their mirth even more
seriously than they do now, and if it was a per-
fectly new production it would probably fall some-
what flat. But it is an interesting relic of the
past, and the last century play in general gives an
opportunity for woman— whose legs are so much
criticised in tights— to observe that not one man
m a hundred dozen has extremities which look
even moderately well in the close-fitting togs of a
century ago, and to reflect that he is a shambling
annual who wears loose pants to disguise the
shapeless knobbiness of his knees and the way his
ankles go askew. This reflection doesn’t apply
specially to the Goodwin co., which stands in-
spection much better than usual, but is intended
as an anathema on the legs of male humanity all
round. Also, in an irrelevant sort of way it may
be remarked just here that “ A Gilded Fool” will
be staged on Saturday.
** * *
The new management at Her Majesty’s put
up as its second effort, “A Trip to Chicago,” and
the best thing that could happen to that sad pro-
dnotion is that it should be buried in oblivion and
nothing more said about it. The “Trip” is a
second edition of the Widow O’Brien—the Widow
grown older and more vulgar, and dressed in
glaring green bloomers, and arriving at noplace
m particular in a steam motor, and making old,
old jokes in the same old brogue, and riding a
horse-race in her green bloomers with her red hair
streaming behind her. The first act consists
mainly in the widow’s son-in-law coming home
drunk and throwing books and derision at her in
her night-dress, and even the people who laughed
when that lady appeared in her night-dress on
board the Bristol don't care for the same undressed
joke a second time. Second act is a variety-
show and a horse-race. Probably the saddest
thing about the musical comedy is the way the
people suddenly ask each other to sing, apropos of
nothing at all, songs that have no bearing
on the alleged story, and then sit round and pro-
ff®* t°„ enjoy listening to each other, and in the
-Lrip they do it worse and with a more awful
grin of suffering than usual. None of the songs
are anything in particular, neither are the singers.
Ihe widow is stale, and some of her Irish funni-
ments are dull, and some of them are coarse, espe-
cially the one about the fleas on the dog, and her
assaults on her son-in-law with the umbrella are
very uninteresting horse-play. Moreover, unless
the foot of judicious suppression is put down on
her, it is evident that the widow may run to 40
editions or more the present O’Brien comedy is
the mechanical kind that can be turned out by the
hundred and that would be too great a curse for
human endurance. Taking it all round, The
-Bulletin doesn t remember any musical comedy
• 8 more enthusiastic objections to than
the I rip to Chicago.” The management, by the
"Y a y> seems to have wisely decided to abandon
that lamentable thing almost as soon as it ap-
peared, and a bulky drama called “Foiled” is
announced for Saturday.

Tj l ® Bo , er drama at Sydney Royal, casually
alluded to last week as a production which made
this paper feel a good deal tired in various ways
still uprears the British Flag to public admiration!
Baker, however, no longer makes his loyal speech
on top of the uneasy horse in Act 1., but relieves
himself of any patriotic observations which are on
his chest while standing on the ground. Why
this drama happens to be called “ For England ’’
rt is difficult to say; nothing more than usually
English occurs in it, and no one does any-
thing that is more definitely for England than it is
tor J ersey or the Isle of Man or Kerry or Donegal
or the Orkneys or Singapore, or anywhere else^n
. m P ire * the patriotic aspect of it is
nothing in particular, the horse aspect is especially
brilliant. Ihe fox-hunt with the six-foot drop
down a bright green stage precipice and the wild
gallop through a wood of property trees is a very
tjV 6 a , air ’ and time is probably coming when
Bland Holt, in his constant desire for a still bigger
horse-effect than the last one, will break some-
body s neck, and the curtain will fall with a dead
steed dropping over into the orchestra on top of an
astonished trombone and a badly-scared big drum.

Mr. Walter Barnett (of Falk and Co ) and
Mr. Westmacott allege that they are running
i-™ e authorised cinematographe in Austra
lici at 237 Pitt-street, Sydney.
* * • *
The principle of the Cinematographe now
having so marvellous and well - deserved a run
is exposing lin. by fin. photographic films at
the rate of 45 per second to a 2000-candle-
power electric light, behind a lens, thus pro-
joolnig each picture life-size upon a 10ft. bv
12ft. screen. It is a great step ahead of the
Hmetoscope, and reproduces with the colorlessness
of photography the movements and details of any
phase of life. Two Frenchmen, the brothers
August and Louis Lumiere, manufacturers of
photographic materials, invented this machine
after considerable expenditure of time and money
Like every other novelty, it has been harassed bv
more or less successful imitators. In London it
was speedily opposed by some 20 imitations but
these seem to have gradually lost public support.
London, Paris, Manchester, Birmingham, like
Australia, are understood to have each but one
Lumiere Cmematographe. The London one, at
the Empire Theatre, is credited with paying the
inventors £4O royalty every time it shows, and
Lumieres’ world’s total of 23 machines are esti-
mated to return £l5OOO royalty monthly. The
machine will be managed in Australia on business
lines, and will shortly add local subjects to its
stock. The Cmematographe seems likely to prove
the very best show-speculation ever brought to
Australia. By the way, Mr. Barnett asserts that
Anshutz, of Berlin, and not Edison, is the in-
ventor of the Kinetoscope, and he will give Sydney
Hospital £lOO on this statement being proved in-
correct.
** * *
Alfred Dampier returned to Melbourne
Alexandra on Saturday, and the crowd in front
roared at him with all the enthusiasm of former
times. Also, the tumult was repeated after every
act, therefore it may be taken for granted that
Dampier and Co. have come to stay for a reason-
able period. “ Robbery Under Arms,” regarded
as a play, seems none the better for reconstruction,
but, in the matter of appealing to the lawless
instincts of the Alexandra gods, it is stronger than
before. Boldrewood’s novel teaches the beautifnl
lesson that it is safer to be a policeman than to go
cattle-stealing, and that the wages of sticking-up
the mail coach is tribulation, whereas the riotous
drama under notice incites to felony and heaps
contumely on the foorce. The fact that gallant
Captain Dampier doesn’t rob women is palmed off
upon the gallery as a virtue, but, considering that
the principal spinster in the plot is always on the
verge of shooting a police-inspector in the execution
of his duty, the Captain’s peculiarity seems open
to argument, anyway. Miss Lily Dampier is in
every way a more formidable heroine than she
used to be, and her composed manner of pointing
a new revolver at the Law contrasts favorably
with the scared deportment of sister Rose. The
show otherwise has not gained in weight. Alfred
Dampier s fine voice rings out as cheerfully as
ever, and the solemn tones of Edmund Holloway
have not grown less, likewise Lachlan M‘Gowan
makes his meaning clear, but several new people
in old familiar parts will need to speak up louder
as the season advances. “ Robbery Under
Arms,” which is well supplied with Australian
bush landscape, promises to run until consider
ably further notice.

“A Trip to Chinatown ” finishes at the
Princess’s on Eriday, and on Saturday (Oct. 10)
the capacity of “Hoyt’s Comedians” will be
further tested in “ A Milk White Flag.” Howard
Vernon joins the co. for this occasion, and a new
arrival from America takes the part that George
Laun was understood to be getting ready to play,
if necessary. A full chorus, ballet, and heavy
f? e A ni sj-?i X P ense ? are incurred in the production of
A Milk White Flag,” which will be decidedly
more imposing than the present show.

“ Tommy Atkins ” thrives fairly at Mel-
bourne Royal. British valor is rather a drug on
the market just now, neither does the hoisting of
a Union Jack, which is apt to get stuck half-way
up the pole, stir the multitude to their vitals,
nevertheless, “ Tommy Atkins ” will continue for
wee k or two. The plot has several points
of difference from other yarns of its class, and the
depraved organist who revenges himself upon his
false sweetheart by making her best soldier drunk
every evening of his honeymoon is a new kind of
reflection on the blessed church.

At the Opera House there is no reduction
in the profits of H. Rickards. The auditorium
was flashlight photo’d the other evening as a

business if there were any vacant standing-room
to be.filled up.

seemed to have marvellous fascination for womankind,

real name—got married while he was acting-manager of

of her present husband, Max Rovvn, merchant, is, so far
not known to the Australian public. When Max was in

and set in the pretty little singer’s boots.
Hilda Spong is described from London as “a young
lady from Australia who possesses all the charm of

Dear Bbllrtjv,— Your correspondent “Brigham
Brown’s ” criticism on the Revd. Chas. Clark as a lecturer
appears to have raised the ire of at least one occa-
sional contributor. As one who also went to hear
“ the Prince of Lecturers,” expecting much, and who
was wofully disappointed, I should like to say
wry gently and very confidentially (for fear of
being called “a cracked mirror of epileptic thought”)
that. I consider “Brigham Brown” deserves thanks for
having “ bell’d the cat.” The fact of the matter is that
given a clever high priest the universal worship of a
fetish is a natural result. Chas, Clark is the fetish. The
astute and insistent business-manager is the Hierophant.
Keep on telling people that a thing is very good indeed
and they will believe it implicitly. Clark has “ one of tht
marvellously accurate memories of the world.” That and
not much more. It enables him to declaim for two solid
hours without losing a word. But it is declamation which
moves the hearts of his listeners not one throb quicker,
dims no eye, brings no lump into the throat-at least his
even, passionless recital of Dickens’s “Carol” brought
none into mine. Clark at his best is always a preacher,
and the platform is his pulpit. Memory"! Yes, but if
mnemonics are synonymous with a “fine interpretation,"
then Bidder, the boy who could remember and reel o’f
five pages of figures, must have made even arithmetic
seem poetical.—B.E.

An interesting letter from “The Trio” .--Dear Bulle-
tin,—About street busking. As it is pretty well known
by now that we re among- the latest additions to Sydney
stieet players, it may satisfy curiosity to learn some of
our experiences. That there is some curiosity we have no
cloubt—‘Ns the kid’s carryin’ ’em through,” “What’s
that blessed thing she’s playing ? ’’—such remarks, and
many more, we hear on every corner. So anxious are the
youngsters to get a peep at the takings that our hat
often conies grievously near a spill. Even the bank-teller,
as we take in our earnings, follows our movements with
open curiosity. Well, the result has been good-beyond
all expectations. We entered the business, not with
great hopes, but from dire necessity, the result of a long
sickness and a crippling of funds. I have read in your
columns of street musicians turning over £6OO in the 12
months. I can now reckon it quite possible, when during
our three weeks' trial we have averaged 30s. a day of
about hours-and we are new to it! Except when
working at night, we have started at 12 and knocked off
at 5.30, when the rush of homeward people spoils a crowd.
Our biggest day has been a Saturday—l 2 to 6 p.m., 435. 6d
On a single stand in the marine end of George-st., anight
or two back, we gathered 17s. odd in less than 15 minutes.
Night playing is decidedly best, but the most risky.
The ponce are more numerous, and have less to occupy
then time. As a rule, both in town and country, under
various conditions, I have found the police a fine, broad-
minded set of men, but a devil in the force is a devil, and
street-players need not go far to find one a man who
needlessly harasses itinerant musicians and the miser-
ables who “do the street” for a living. Among our
most generous patrons have always been the Jews’
and let me tell you that the Chinese don t slink
away when the hat comes round— oft-times they
have put the only silver coin in. This means of liv-
ing is wearying, risky, and very monotonous. Our per-
sonal friends compliment us bn our nerve. Anyhow, our
object is now gained. We have put away a solid £2O out
weeks m the streets,” and 1 trust they will see
unfihvw J- ,Ut doesn’t the result point, to a peculiar
unhtimss of things when, without expense, we can make
moie dollars than half a dozen members of the many com-
t oo ha ! ldful . s of people in the halls and
theaties of Sydney? There is a vast crowd which no pre-
text whatei er will entice under a roof, yet who give freely
as tne spirit moves.

The Wild-Cat Column.
The little Temperance and General Life Assur-
ance Society has just finished its five-yearly investigation.
The profit shown-i.e., the surplus which the book-value
of the assets shows over the liabilities-—is A 27,850, but of
this it has been decided to write off £23,485 to cover de-
preciation of assets, so the balance for bonus purposes is
onlv £4365. Consequently the bonus will be a very
humble affair. Still the Temperance and General has un-
doubtedly done the only right thing under the circum-
stances, and if the fact can only be driven into the public
comprehension that security is the first consideration and
the bonus only a secondary affair, its action should boom
the business considerably." The writing-off represents 10
per cent, of the entire assets (£238,000), but the losses are
presumably confined to the mortgages and freehold pro-
perties, and in that case it means that nearly 12 per cent,
has been written off the book-values. As far as The Bul-
letin knows, this is the biggest writing-down on record
among Australian insurance societies, except that which
a Victorian office did when it set itself, some months
a°-o, to bring all its assets down to bed-rock values. And
the figures raise the old uneasiness about the state of a
lot of insurance business in this country. The bulk
of the funds of Australian offices are invested in free-
hold propertv and mortgages on ditto. The drop in
freehold values in N.S.W., Victoria and Maoriland, and in
a less degree in other provinces, has been stupendous,
and a return to the old values is not a thing to be
relied on too confidently. And when the very large
percentages written off by three offices are compared
with the comparatively small provision for depreciation
made by some other offices, it raises a suspicion that some
insurance assets—like a lot of bank assets—can’t bear too
much inspection. Nothing short of a rigid and regular
State audit can set the doubt at rest.
One thing is certain : The reserve-funds of the
biggest insurance societies and those of the biggest banks
are very different affairs. The Commercial Banking Co.
of Sydney has a reserve of £1,000,000 to cover possible
loss on £12,000,000 of property ; the A.M.P. Society has a
reserve of £424,000 to Cover possible loss on £13,000,000.
The policy of distributing practically all the profit in
bonuses as they went along has.been the weak point
among Australian insurance offices. And the reason why
The Bulletin calls aloud for State supervision is that the
insurance office can become more and more rotten for a
century without detection, provided it keeps setting down
its depreciated assets at book-value, and it gets enough
premiums each year to meet its outgoings so that it
hasn’t actually to stop payment, and none of its confi-
dential officers talk in their sleep and thus let the matter
out.
The Temperance and General now fixes its as-
sumed future rate of interest at 34 per cent. Several
other offices, notably the A.M.P. and Mutual Life Associa-
tion, are now down to this rate or just getting to it, and
they will probably all get there shortly. This reduction
from the old 4-or-more per cent, will make bonuses smaller
in the future ; but it is inevitable, as things now are, if
there is to be any decent security for policy-holders, and
the sooner it is generally arrived at the better.

For the 12 months ended Sept. 30, the Westra-
lian revenue was £2,220,000 against £1,235,000 for the
previous year, an increase of nearly a million. Westralia,
on the strength of its giddy boom, is now passing a bill to
authorise the borrowing of another £3,500,000, and a
further loan of £3,500,000 is expected shortly afterwards,
as the Government has about £7,000,000 of works in
prospect. Even without this, however, the loan now
actually in view will make Westralia, in proportion to
population, very nearly the most indebted country on
earth, only Queensland, S. A. and Maoriland being ahead
of it, and it will have got in five years to a point which
the other provinces arrived at in about twenty. If the
second £3,500,000 loan proves a reality, then Westralia
should have the biggest debt per head in this world.
What will ultimately become of the riotous province is the
most interesting question of the day. If the gold-boom
should burst, the biggest smash Australia has yet seen is
nothing to what will happen.
* * * *
The Maoriland Midland Railway Co., that
beautiful embodiment of “private enterprise” is again
howling for State assistance. The Midland Co. agreed, in
the first place, to build a railway provided the State gave
it an immense subsidy in land. It collected a lot of the
subsidy, but it only built a small part of the line, and
then it collapsed, the whole trouble being that the share-
holders refused flatly to put up the required capital, and
their credit was so bad that they couldn’t borrow enough
for their purpose. So they stopped work, and their con-
tract expired, and the line being unfinished, with no pro-
spect of anything further being done, the Government
took possession as provided in the agreement. Now the
Midland Co. suggests (1) that the line should be handed
back; (2) that the Government should give it another
long contract so that it may have time to think seriously
over the job again ; (3) that the State should lend it
£600,000 worth of 3 per cent, debentures, so that it can
sell them in order to raise the money to build its own
railway as it won’t risk its own money on the job. The
State could about build the line itself for this sum, and
the practically busted co. which asks the nation to put up
£600,000, never had more than £250,000 of its own money
at risk, and has got a, lot of that back in dividends which
were paid out of capital. Yet it calls itself private enter-
prise. These provinces are about full up of .1. Bull’s
private enterprise, and Maoriland in particular isn’t tak-
ing any more Midland Railway at present.
* * * *
It is stated that the Maoriland Midland Railway
Co. for 10 years, paid its manager £2600 a year salary, and
from 5 to 10 per cent, on contracts, which made up his
screw to an average of £9600. Think of it; £9600 a year
for being nominal boss of one small railway, not one-third
built. Yet they talk of the economy of private, as com-
pared to State, enterprise—and the State in these pro-
vinces gets a good manager for 10 times as much railway
at one-third the money.
*** * *
Still another “private enterprise” has started
to howl piteously on the door-mat of this country for
State assistance. The Mildura Irrigation Co.’s British
debenture-holders are the trouble this time, and what
they want is that the Vic. Government shall not resume
the unearned portion of the Chaffe.vs’ grant because it is
“part of their (the debenture-holders’) security.” The
Chaffeys received their grant conditionally on their exe-
cuting certain irrigation works; if the works were
executed the grant became absolute —not other-
wise. The English debenture-holders chose to lend
them money on the security of the land Chaf-
feys’ co. was to get if it fulfilled the necessary
conditions, and charged high interest because the security
was shaky. The conditions were not fulfilled, and the
Vic. Government refuses to see that it should part with
the remaining land without receiving the agreed-upon
consideration merely to pay the Mildura co.’s bad debts.
And now a shriek is going up that the Government’s re-
fusal to pay these debts by handing over a vast area of
land is “unfair” and “ will be commented on most un-
favorably in Great Britain.” Probably it will. Great
Britain always comments unfavorably unless it gets
everything it wants, and it wants such a lot.

The Freehold Assets Realisation Co. (Melb.),
which took over the difficulties of the-old Freehold Invest-
ment and Banking Co., is making good progress on a
novel plan. Whenever a decent sum in cash is accumu-
lated, it calls for tenders among holders of the old com-
pany’s deposit-receipts, and buys up those that are offered
cheapest. The last event of this kind resulted in the ex-
tinction of over £27,000 worth of liabilities for about
£5OOO. It is an interesting gamble ; the man who holds
on to the last may get 20s. in the £, or he may get j.d. or
less, just as things turn out.

Five Dock, the most bankrupt municipality-
round Sydney, has had the furniture of the Council
Chambers sold up, the overdraft stopped, the street gas-
supply shut off (leaving the district in darkness), and a
swarm of writs issued against it by miscellaneous credi-
tors. Now it is waiting to see what will happen next.
Under the Municipalities Act no Council can borrow to
the extent of more than five years’ revenue, but according
to Cbghlan’s statistics Five Dock has a revenue of £959
and a debt of about £6OOO. The chief use of Five Dock is
as an awful example of the results of too much local
government.
A howl goes up in Tasmania for a private rail-
way from Hobart toZeelian. “It must be done by pri-
vate enterprise,” says a local paper. “ The Government
haven’t got, nor never will have, the money to accom-
plish the task.” Possibly, but if the railway is built by a
private co. it will be a foreign co. that will do it, and as
Tasmania must find the dividends it will owe the money
just as much as if the Government borrowed it and built
the line in the usual way. The difference would be that
the Government could get the money at 3J4 percent,
while the co. will probably raise it by issuing debentures
at 4 or 4>4 or 5 per cent., so the country will have to find
more money for the private enterprise than it would for
the public one.
* * * *
Sundry British capitalists have offered to go in
largely for the wine industry in Victoria and invest
£250,000 therein, provided Vic. Government guarantees 3
per cent, interest on their money for 14 years—£7soo a
year £105,000 in all. This State-subsidised concern
would, of course, be described as private enterprise. The
State would stand the loss up to 3 per cent., but it would
get none of the profit, if there was one, and there would
apparently be no guarantee that the co. wouldn’t flicker
down to nothing in its second year, and the Government
be left to subsidise a practically dead institution for 12
years thereafter. Victoria is now considering whether, if
it is going to risk £105,000 to prop up anybody’s private
w'ine business, it might not as well subsidise local in-
vestors with the money. A guarantee of 3 per cent, for
14 years would probably cause all the old boomers of
Melb. to rush together and float a big company inside a
week. And the local men know something about wine ;
they would spend the State subsidy locally ; they would
be more within reach of control; the Treasurer w'buld get
part of the subsidy back in probate duty when they died,
and they wouldn’t fill the British papers with curses about
how they were shamefully' ill-treated by a beastly colonial
Government—after the fashion of the Midland Railway
gang and the Mildura debenture-holders.

Company-floaters and other financial wind-
raisers in N.S.W. will want to keep a steady eye on
Income-tax Spiller. Properties have, it is understood,
recently changed hands on representations as to last
year’s income largely in excess of the income reported to
the Taxing Department. Whatever the value of caveat
emptor in the purchasers, that piece of persiflage serves
merely as a whet to the appetite of the Income-tax Com-
missioners.
* » * *
N.S.W. Income-tax Commissioners supply a
fine example of official impudence. After having received
returns of trust-moneys paid, and three or four days
before tax-payment was due, they served apparently
everybody who received money under a trust with a
demand to pay tax on the amount. Now, unless the
payee was in receipt of over £2OO a year in trust-
moneys, or in trust-moneys and other moneys com-
bined, no income-tax was legally due. But, with splen-
did recklessness, the Commissioners “hanged” the Par-
liamentary enactment, and forwarded their please-pay-ups
to possibly thousands of widows, wards, and orphans, whose
sole income was derived from a trust, and ranged from
£lO a year to anything under the exemption-limit of
£2OO. Seemingly, not a word was said about exemption ;
only three or four days’ notice was given ; and the demand
to pay was peremptory. The consequence was that a
large number of trustees and w'ards did pay up—quite
illegally.
One man read up the law, and went to seek an
explanation. _ “ Here is my sister drawing £4O a year
from a trust ; it is her sole income ; why do you tax her?”
“ Oh,” said the Commissioner, cheerfully, “ we thought
she might have some other income.” “ But you have
already asked people with incomes over the exemption-
limit to furnish returns ; she has not done so ; therefore,
you know her income is not over the exemption-limit.”
The Commissioner cheerfully waived this aspect of the
case. “Then you have actually collected hundreds of
small sums illegally, at three or four days’ notice, from
people too ignorant or too hurried to protest.” Tile
Commissioners were understood to cheerfully admit that
wajS so. “But,” the expostulator was told, “if it turns
out that there was no tax due you can get it back at the
Treasury.” “When?” “Oh, in two or three months
time.”
Isn’t it amazing ? The Bulletin exhorts
trustees who have responded to this illegal demand to
clamor at the Treasury for a refund —it is apparently the
only thing they can do—and to make the Treasury stamp
the receipt which it will oblige them to give. And it calls
Parliamentary attention to the fact that, by making
absurd and illegal demands, the Commissioners are really
doing their best to upset the scheme of direct-taxation
altogether.

Ed. Bulletin, —My life-insurance history
apropos of recent “ wild-cat” comments. In 1877, at the
age of 37, I insured my life for £5OO ; premium £l7 per
annum, payable half-yearly. For 18)4 years I never failed
to pay the premium ; paid in all £314 10s. In Dec., ’B2, I
borrowed £4O on policy ;in May, ’87,1 borrowed a further
£l6. I paid no interest on these loans, thinking it would
be met by bonus additions. The interest on that £56 has
caused my policy to lapse, and I received no notice for
months afterwards. Thus, by borrowing £56 I have lost
£258 (to say nothing of interest). In July, ’93, when
thought to be dying, I got a letter from the society show-
ing the policy to be then worth £432. Could a State life-
department treat its members so?—J.H.N. [Will the

After the passing of the Bill to amend the Insol-

is reported, to bring in a Bill to place the county court
Judges, who sit in the Insolvency Court, on the same

The latest little unpleasantness between the

a whole or half-day’s salary at the discretion of a man who
may be practising before him as a barrister next morning.

Melbourne telephone service, sticking to the
original expensive rate, has only 1750 subscribers on the
roll, 250 less than Sydney numbered previous to the re-
duction of the rate to a “ fiver,” an experiment that
promptly doubled its telephone circulation. P.M.G.
Duffy, therefore, is being vehemently implored to try a
reduced rate in Melbourne, but that superior personage
merely blinks behind his pince-nez. Candidly speaking,
the local telephone department is not in a fit state to deal
with an increase of business. It has only lately begun to
recover from a long razzle-dazzle, and the hat which it
jams with difficulty upon its fevered brow still carries the
toe-mark of the yellow-haired barmaid who used to kick
so high in the high old time.

Again the N.S.W. Assembly has been barking
up the wrong tree in the debate on the Patents Amend-
ment Bill. It is all on account of the cyanide patentees.
As a fact, the real object of the bill is to enable the
inventor of the (Ashcroft) sulphide process to so amend
his specifications as to hold the rights he lias so fairly
earned. Flaws in the specifications were discovered in
America long ago, and more than one journal pointed out
that the law of N.S.W. did not provide for the required
alterations. The cyanide patent, as well as others, may
benefit by the bill incidentally.

big operators, and managed the commercial future of
many busted boomers. But when all the corpses of the
boom had been buried, Fischer found his occupation gone,
and so took a prussic-acid ticket to the Never-Never.

An important day’s business in the City of

that the Age supposes its readers to be indifferent to

The Grand Hotel, Melb., which was more or less
launched by James Munro on a wave of teetotal cant, is
now sailing fairly towards the Black Sea of intoxicating
liquor. A strong body of shareholders, having David
Syme for a backbone, declared last week in favor of con-
verting the coffee-palace into a plain straightforward grog-
shop, where residents may whisky-up to the glory of the
management instead of buying their insobriety by
stealth from an adjacent pub. The reformers propose to
strengthen their property with a native wine-license,
and “ a grocer’s license to sell wine and spirits of any sort
in nob less than pint bottles,” and it is said that a poll
taken on this question would have resulted in the over-
throw of the old snufflebusting policy but for an unfor-
tunate accident to a bundle of “booze” proxies which
came reeling in a few minutes after time for closing the
poll. Anyway, the Grand Hotel in its present form seems
to be doomed. The typical lodger of the near future will
be a red-faced man with nothing less than a pint bottle
to his lips when he feels so disposed, and then the strictly
temperance shareholders will stand afar off and bemoan
the growth of a new and bloated prosperity that insults
their principles and gives them a sinful return for their
investment. Amen.

The writer, having for years vainly advo-
cated in this page the establishment in N.S. Wales
of a national smelting works, now wishes every
success to the (private) works going up in the Illa-
warra district under the direction of the capable
John Howell. The luck of the venture very largely
depends on the quantity of various ores purchasable by
assay in N.S.W. Therein lies the difficulty. Throughout
Australia, and especially in N.S.W., there exists a deep-
rooted suspicion that the system means robbery. The
writer never saw' a stamp-mill that gave satisfaction when
it crushed for the public. The gold was always “ left in
the tailings.” Letters received every week at Cl.yde
works show that all ores are thought to contain much
more value than the actual test shows can be extracted.
In America custom-works will have sometimes on their
dumps half-a-million worth of bought ore awaiting treat-
ment. The question is : how long will it take to overcome
this prejudice in Australia ? State works would be
trusted, hence it is that so many lots are sent to be
treated by a rattle-trap battery at the Mint. The Govt,
toy works started at Clyde does not fill a want. What,
for instance, could be done with ten tons of ore containing
gold, with a large percentage of zinc and antimony ? And
this little crushing and concentrating plant is called the
N.S.W. Govt. Metallurgical Works! Mr. Howell may be
relied on to give every reasonable guarantee to his clients.
* * * *
After months of careful experimenting and
manipulating in the face of great difficulties, among them
the departure of most of their best men to the West,
Block 10 will have at length been got to do fair work —
fair, that is, for a concentrating plant, which is a poor
thing at the best, and considering the refractory stuff at
disposal. A pretty fair idea of what is meant by “ the
solution of the sulphide problem,” so far as concentrating
is relied upon as the solution, can be got from an analysis
of Block 10’s figures. The mill, we are told, treated
1347 J tons, assaying in the bulk 20'50z. silver, 20'5 per
cent, lead, and 29 per cent. zinc. That is, approximately,
26,9550 z. silver, 2694 tons lead, and 390$ tons zinc.
The concentrates weighed 316 tons, assaying 32T00z.
silver, 66T per cent, lead, and B‘3 per cent,
zinc. That is, the concentrates contained 10,1440 z.
silver and 208$ tons lead, while the losses were 16,8110 z.
silver and tons lead. There still remained in the
concentrates 25$ tons zinc. To eliminate 365 tons of zinc
contained in 1347J4 tons ore it cost, besides the expense of
the concentrating process, metal (apart from the zinc)
worth £2750. Yet, as said just now, this is very fair
work. So much for the concentrating method : the field
is still open. For even tl.e Ashcroft and Howell pro-
cesses depend, to some extent at least, upon preliminary
concentration. The average of the ore broken through-
out Block 10 is, by the way, very close to the value of the
ore put through the mill during the week referred to in
this par. ; the silver average is a little low'er in the present
faces perhaps.
The British mill is treating about the same
quantity of ore as Block 10 —rather less —but for a soine-
what higher concentrate return. The British is, however,
treating carbonates to a large extent. The lead contents
are about the same as Block 10’s, but the silver contents
are 4 per cent, lower. With regard to these concentrate
returns, however, it oug'ht to be remembered that unless
they give the percentage of zinc contained they are
worthless, and often misleading. It is easy' enough to get
good silver and lead percentages if no special care is taken
to eliminate the zinc. But the smelters make a serious
deduction per unit of zinc above about 6 per cent.
Block 14 continues to open out on medium-grade
milling sulphide ore remarkably well.

Broken Hill people didn’t believe it could be
that Col. Morgan who formerly managed the British
8.H., to whom the nasty disclosures in connection with
the allegedly-spurious Buchan silver and lead mine,
Gippsland, referred. But when they read the manager's
description of how the gallant colonel toyed with a
revolver, their doubts ended absolutely. Morgan was
sent out by the English co. to manage the British just
before the big strike; and very early in the trouble he
was attacked by boss Sleath. The colonel promptly sent
down a challenge to fight, and begged Sleath to choose
the weapons without delay'. Sleath’s reply was a retrac-
tation more complete than he had ever made before. But
the colonel was voted a good sort, and habitually regaled
with whisky the picket sergeants-as they did their rounds
in the cold nights.

Father Curran returns from touring White
Cliffs (N.S.W.) field filled with the belief that the opal-
bearing country is much more extensive than the area
now being prospected. Since the English co. got to work
on the field the demand for the gem has fallen away, as
fewer buyers are now on the spot, the co. sending all its
stuff (comprising more than half of the total product of
the field) direct to the European markets. The small
claimholders are consequently combining to sen 4 to
Europe an agent in their interests, and to that end are
seeking the co-operation of the Queensland opal-getters—
so far, however, without success.

Jack Roberts, the capable mining representa-
tive of Sydney' D.T., has let some daylight into the Yul-
gilbar goldfield, N.S.W. He proves the rush unwarranted.
Disappointed diggers are returning ; the biggest nugget
found on the field, which, according to the shipping
reporter of the Stab, would outrival Ballarat and make
Coolgardie a byword and a reproach, was 71dwts. The
alleged mountain of gold is a massive ridge of granite,
tough as adamant. The veins are not only small, but are
embedded in granite, without a “dig” of any kind.
Numbers of people have been grossly misled by this
“ marine-mining reporter,” and implored Roberts not to
delay in revealing the true state of things, hence his first
article was wired down.

Pambula, N.S.W. : “ A clean-up of 130 tons of

come from the 3000 tons of seconds so much fuss has been
made about? If it did, then admitting that the battery
lost over 60 per cent., the heap will come a long way short
of the 2oz. per ton estimated to be its worth by news-

advice and left mining alone. Your best plan now is to
get out of everything of the kind. It is very seldom that
ladies do any good when they commence to deal.” A
little more repentance and The*Bulletin will regard the

The poor old London market is threatened with
another mine from Stuart Town, the Perseverance, a good

has never heard much of the mine, but it is satisfactory
to learn that each of the directors is to get £l5O a year
and the chairman £2OO for looking after it in London.
Capital £112,500. Proposed to offer shortly, but if, mean-
while, Bull is made aware of the sick state of another of
his mines on the same field —the Golden Gully—the Per-
severance promoters, however good or bad their show,

because from one end of the country to the other it has
been proved that, where one mine lives, a hundred have
a very sudden way of dying. “ Too much white quartz.”
Kalgoorlie may be the great exception, and it has much
hope in the fact that it is not working white quartz.

East Mexican mine, C. Towers, adjoins the

the last 10 years by an Adelaide co. without a crushing,
much less a div. Sank a main shaft deep enough to strike
the Brilliant reef, but didn’t—came on a fault. The
Brilliant has worked two levels up to its boundary, and
the Mexican is now working from No. 6 Brilliant level
where the stone is about 2ft. and worth from 1 to 2oz.
No. 7 level in the boss mine has fully 4ft. of good stone on

Broken Hill Proprietary people are nibbling at
the country around Hawker (S.A.), which they expect to
pan-out “ big.”
With regard to a paragraph in its issue of
26th September, The Bulletin is assured that
Capt Strachan, as plaintiff in a recent Tasmanian
libel-case, “ did not wave his hands over his head
in the witness-box, and he did not make himself
out to be anything but an ordinary man of the
world, a British sailor, and the expression, * Mer-
ciful God !’ was not made use of by him during
the whole of his examination.” The Bulletin
regrets having given circulation to incorrect state-
ments of a contrary tenor.
Ex-constable H. A. Slater, of Sydney, is
reaching, as it were, for the scalp of Capt. Slocum,
the adventurous Yankee mariner, who is single-
handedly sailing round the world and has just
arrived in Newcastle. Slater claims to have for-
merly sailed with Slocum and to be in a position
to show that the captain is hardly entitled to the
public welcome which it is proposed he should be
accorded at Sydney. Slater has submitted a sum-
mary of his argument to The Bulletin, which,
however, proposes to let plaintiff and defendant
fight the matter out themselves.

The State funeral to P. P. Gillen, the late
S.A. Lands Minister, was far more decorous than
most such functions are, for everyone attending
was sincerely sorry for his death. At Clare, how-
ever, by some mistake the local residents appro-
priated the drags set apart for Ministers, legis-
lators, and heads of departments, and so those
functionaries had to travel on foot behind the
hearse for a distance of five miles to the grave at
Seven Hills college cemetery. When Education
Minister Bews was buried six years ago, the
travellers by special train were supplied with in-
toxicants on the journey at the State expense, and
the result was that nearly a dozen of the pas-
sengers became obtrusively drunk. In the case of
Mr. Gillen, light refreshments were provided at
Clare, but only tea and coffee were paid for by
Govt. Mr. Gillen, like every one of his colleagues,
except the Chief Secretary, was a teetotaller.

The lady, who was in trouble over the sly-grog
business, was too ill to be run down through the
glare and the dust-storms to Perth. The local
authorities hadn’t nerve enough to chain her to a
tree for the term of her sentence, so they sent her
home, and a policeman lived in the house and kept
her in nominal custody till her term expired. And
now people want to know if it is the right thing
in a civilised country to sentence any woman to
have a strange man in the house for a month ?

The other night, some unknown Goth
smashed the figure of the Venus di Medici, in Syd-

thing happened in Melb., at the hands of some
“ bloods ” out for the night. One was the son of a
well-known legal official and associate to a Judge,
himself a patron of art; another was a Govt,
official and brother to an eminent barrister. They
had been “ indulging ” over-night, and early in
the morning visited Fitzroy Gardens, and with
their walking-sticks broke several statues. The
offenders were recognised, and the Judge desired
his associate never to see him again. The elder
culprit had influence enough to square matters, and
managed to keep his billet.

The latest cruelty item arose out of a mid
night spree at Wollongong (N.S.W.), where two
youths have pleaded guilty to maliciously injuring
horses. A fore-leg of one of the animals was
almost cut through just above the hoof ; a large
splinter of wood was stuck in the poor brute’s
forehead, and a tin-dish was tied to its tail.
Another horse had a piece of barbed-wire twisted
round its body with a post-rail attached to the
end of it. Every time the animal moved the
points of the wire cut into its body. The inter-
esting pair were committed for trial.
Next week several more young women leave

There was a rather singular scene at Suf-
field’s trial during the cross-examination of the
prosecutrix by barrister Edmunds, representing
Suffield. It was alleged that to a fellow-servant
prosecutrix had described her assailant as wearing
“a rather hairy coat, like Master ’s.”
(“ Master ” was a young gentleman who had
a frieze overcoat. Suffield had no such coat.) She
was asked hadn’t she said “rough hairy coat.”
This she admitted. “And Tike Master ’s’?’
This she denied.
Then counsel asked that she should be allowed
to feel Suffield’s coat, which he was wearing in
the dock, and say whether it was like the one
worn by her assailant. Suffield said he would
save witness the trouble of coming down to
the dock, and took off his coat and handed it up.
It was of fairly rough twill. She felt it and said,
“Yes, it was like that,” and when the barrister
asked “ Do you call that a rough or a hairy coat?”
Judge Windeyer interposed “You had better be
careful.” “Surely, your honor,” said counsel,

“I have not said or done anything that calls for

“ but please remember that a woman’s sense of
texture is very different from a man’s.” Then Mr.
Edmunds said he would ask the jury to say if it
could be called a rough coat. And the jury appar-

Judge Casey (Vic.) says that wives who are

In a certain Melb. coffee-palace
a notice appears in each bedroom to
the effect that the management is not
responsible for the safety of boots left
outside bedroom doors at nights. In
a common drinky hotel you can leave
your boots outside with perfect safety,
but in that holy coffee-palace the. only
safe way to get them cleaned is to
leave them in the office the night be-
fore, and get a receipt for them.
Apropos: though you can safely leave
your boots outside in a hotel it doesn’t
necessarily follow that they will be
cleaned. The present writer once went
on a walking tour in the Illawarra dis-
trict, in the course of which he left
his boots out at 13 different
hotels. They were cleaned ex-
actly four times. Twice he
cleaned them himself.
The other seven times
there were no
brushes, so on
three occasions he
wiped them on the
counterpane, and
four times he
washed them in
the basin in his
bedroom, and dried
them vindictively
on the towel.

At a recent W.C.T.U. pow-wow :
Mrs. Shearing 1 presented “ the unfermented wine ” re-
port, and stated that the use of unfermented wine for
church purposes is becoming more and more general. The
Bishop of Adelaide had been communicated with on the
subject, and had courteously replied through his chaplain
(the Rev. L. P. Crawfurd), although not promising to in-
troduce unfermented wine into the Anglican communion.
The letter stated :
“ The bishop only received your letter just before he
left for a time in the country. He asked me to acknow-
ledge your letter with many thanks to you for it, but at
the same time he does not see any possibility of introduc-
ing unfermented wine into the service for Holy Com-
munion. He begs at the same time to assure you that he
tries to make the wine as light as possible by mixing
water with it. Again thanking you on behalf of the
bishop.”
O for the humorlessness of His Gaiters of Adelaide!
Where does he draw the line, and why, when once
he does water the wine, should he draw any line
at all ? For the watering-the-wine question is like
the divorce-question : once admit the possibility
of qualifying matrimony with divorce and where
are you going to stop ? You can’t logically stop
anywhere.

There is no moral about the Yic. bogus-
will-case, which collapsed the other day, save the
old moral that it is only the awkward malefactor
who has accomplices. The man who forges a will
himself may get through all right, provided he
buys the stationery in a town 500 miles away, and
does the forgery in a room with the door shut and
the window secured, and copies the signatures
accurately, and makes sure that both witnesses
were there or thereabouts at the time of the alleged
signing, and that they have both died since, and
he doesn’t leave the draft of the document lying
about. But the man who calls on casual lawyers
asking them to do the job for him is lost. Bor
that matter, the other man is often lost too, for,
as likely as not, the lawyer whom he didn’t ask to
forge the document will roll up and swear, for a
small consideration, that he did. The legal pro-
fession has to swear to nearly anything for a liveli-
hood in these hard times.

last week when a silly-looking youth was sent to

Under the Infants’ Life Protection Act in

if the birth of an illegitimate child be unregis-
tered within three days of that occurrence —
in wedlock the time allowed for registration
is 60 days. This compels every householder
who may take in a woman-lodger to make
certain, as a matter of prudence, whether
the latter is married or single, but how it is
to be done the Act doesn’t say. Anyhow,
a Melb. suburban lodging-housekeeper
was fined the other day for failing to
comply with the Act, and, although
he registered within the time demanded
in regard to married women, the law
considered that he should have known
all about the statute. The child
wasn’t his, the woman passed herself
off to him as a grass-widow, and sakl
her husband would be down from
the country in a month or so.

Tasmanian Supreme Court objects to being
made a half-way house for Vic. lawyers seeking

A Tasmanian barrister, Picken, was admitted
to the Victorian bar recently. Which slightly
widens the Vic. dog-in-the-manger Act. One
Maoriland barrister has been admitted and one
refused ; South Australia has yet to try ; Queens-
land and N.S.W. have no chance ; and Westralia
would possibly be admitted now, but isn’t likely
to give the Vic. Court a chance to climb down,
and thus enable her own preserves to be swamped
by needy Victorians.

other day, took affirmations instead of the usual
oaths. This is the first Vic. case on record of a
lawyer doing so, although the profession does not
lack those who, in private, contemn the absurd
practise of oscillatory imprecation.
A Melbourne tailor objects to the coming
half-holiday for employes on the ground that God
commanded man to work six days a week. The
Turks also say that it is the will of Allah they
should kill the Armenians. The Almighty is
acquiring a nice character in one way or another.

According to the evidence taken on the
trial of a S. Melb. butcher, charged with exposing
for sale tuberculous beef, the disgusting stuff would
have gone into consumption—“consumption” is
here a good word—but that it was exposed at the
Victoria market, at which an inspector is employed
to condemn diseased meat. Very little food can
stand being traced back to its natural state (re-
marks a Bulletin correspondent). The writer
remembers, when at a township in Canterbury,
Maoriland, some years ago, looking into a shed
where a man was engaged curing bacon; what
spoilt his appetite for pig-meat was not so much
that the salt was being trodden into the flesh with
the curer’s boots as that that gentleman at night-
time trotted round with a lantern and spade per-
forming the duties of local sanitary contractor.

Queensland has almost the highest mar-
riage-rate among the Australian provinces, and the
highest birth-rate of all. The sugar-town of
Bundaberg, Glassey’s electorate, is the most pro-
lific town in Queensland. It may interest people
who regard the North as the very gateway of
Sheol to learn that the death-rate in the United
Kingdom is twice that of Bananaland.

According to last year’s statistics, two-
thirds of Queensland husbands, in ’95, chose
fellow-countrywomen for wives—but only 609 out
of 1367 Q. girls chose native-born Australians for
husbands ! Amazing numbers of girls gave their
age as 21 —which is attributed to false declarations
on the part of girls wanting to marry. The little
dears will commit perjury, face imprisonment, or
anything else, only to secure a man. By the way,
Rockhampton marriages increased 51 on previous
year’s record, while Brisbane increased only to the
extent of 34. Another incontestable proof of
Centralian greatness.

The Big Synod (Anglican) of all Austra-
lasia earned the approval of the Sydney Press
Jeameses for its display of man-millinery. Jeames
was profoundly moved at what he was proud to
call a “spectacular display.’ Yes, “they’d got
’em on,” right enough, but your Anglican bishop
in all his bravery can’t come near the Kyardinal
when he dons his scarlet, or even the wigged
buffoonery of a Full Court on dress parade. What
would Religion or Justice be to Man without
livery? The epaulettes make the soldier; the
ermine makes the judge ; the lawn makes the
bishop. But the Papalists are easily first.

Cairns Chows recently held a joyous picnic

Pastor Bevan (Melb.) now
allows “ free discussion ” after his
Sunday morning’s service. The
privilege of giving back-talk to the
reverend should brighten up the
tabernacle a lot. Hitherto the rev.
has slanged the congregation and
told them they were miserable
sinners with impunity, but when a
hysterical sister is allowed to get
up and state that she isn’t any more
miserable than he is, and anyhow
she is a decent married woman,
and anybody who says she isn’t
should be ashamed of himself, and
the preacher is a cantankerous old
man, and she wouldn’t be seen in
the street with a hat like his, there
will be a lot of thrill about the
proceedings.

An up-country medico was
recently called in a midnight hurry
to attend a poor woman, who had
only half-a-candle in the house.
After vainly asking for more, he
used it to the last atom, left his
patient well, and was passing out
when an elder child, who had been
told by her father that the doctor
might find a baby under a goose-
berry-bush and bring it along, ran
out in her nightgown to enquire:
“Oh, doctor, did you find one?”
“Yes, my dear,” said the doctor
“I found two.” “Two! Oh,
father, if we had only had another
bit of candle ! ”

The prize Sobraon (N.S.W. reformatory-

Franklyn, aged 16, who last week pleaded guilty,
at Quarter Sessions, to breaking, entering and
stealing. He was bound over and let go, only to
be immediately arrested for being illegally at large
from the Sobraon. Sent there originally, the lad
was apprenticed to a farmer, but bolted ; was cap-
tured, and sent to Brush Farm for two years. He
broke out, and was brought back. Escaping again,
he was recaptured and returned to the Sobraon,
and ultimately apprenticed to another country
employer, from whom he took French-leave, to re-
appear shortly afterwards at the Sessions.

Captain of the s.s. Chindera (lost on the
Tweed bar, Sept. 81ast) cross-examined at N.S.W.
Marine Board enquiry (daily paper report) :
To Mr. Arnott: The vessel was the worst steering boat
he had ever been in, and no matter what course she was
being steered could not be relied on to go within three
points of it. No man who had ever been in her could
steer her straight. She had been lengthened, too, and
built up on top, after which alterations—which in his
opinion weakened her —the name had been changed from
Karuah to Chindera, and she was registered as a new
ship.
Adolph Dahlberg, acting mate, corroborated.
This dodge of re-naming old boats is an ancient
one and much practised in certain circles. By the
way, if the captain and mate of the Chindera are
telling the truth, who licenses the Chindera to go
to sea ?

But to label any remarried divorcees as “bigamous” or
“adulterous” is outside any Church’s jurisdiction, and
comes clearly within the penalties of the defamation law.

Ex-Mayor Langford,
NORTH MELBOURNE,
President of the Shire of Romsey,
tells you Warner’s Safe Cure will make you well
and strong. Everybody knows Robert Langford,
Esq., and when he tells people everywhere to take
Warner’s Safe Cure for liver trouble, all know
that he means just what he says.
(t Melbourne, 18th Sept., 1896.
. About seven or eight years ago I was suffering
with severe pains in my right side and under the
shoulder blades: also flatulency and indiges-
tion. _ My urine was very much discolored and
contained a thick sediment. This naturally un-
fitted me for my business, and with loss of sleep
and no appetite I thought my time had come. 1
had some of the best medical men attending me,
who prescribed all sorts of medicines without
doing me the least good, so I decided to give them
up and try Warner’s Safe Cure, which had not
only been recommended me by several friends who
had derived great benefits from it, but I had read
one of their pamphlets of cases similar to mine
being cured by it, and testimonials from well-
known citizens whom I knew. I quickly decided
to'try it, and consequently sent for three bottles
and some of the Pills. When I took the first
bottle I did not feel a bit better: in fact, I
thought I was worse, but as one bottle does not
always have the effect, I persevered with it, and
when I had got through with the fourth bottle the
improvement was so marked that I still kept at it,
and when I had taken about fourteen bottles, I
was so well and strong that I had no necessity to
take any more, as I really felt a new man and fit
for business, with more energy than I had before.
I have much confidence in recommending Warner’s
Safe Cure to anyone who suffers with liver com-
plaint. ’’—Robert Langford, (Fish Market, Melb.)
This medicine is better than all the stimulants
or other stuff which people take to “ brace up ” on,
because it is a scientific remedy that has been
tried in every civilised country, and because its
effect is permanent. It does not make a person
better for a short time and then lose its influence,
but when it is taken properly it gives them new
life. It builds up the weakened system and re-
stores the liver to its normal activity. Send post-
card to Warner’s Safe Cure Company for a new
pamphlet treating of liver and kidney diseases.

“ Alick,” the aboriginal who died in Maitland hospital
a few days ago, was once well-known in N.Q. by his native
name, “ Reka.” _ Some time back he left his tribe and
joined a travelling circus. The aboriginals, by the way,
are exhibiting an unhallowed desire to go into the show
business wherever they can. In an attempt to throw a
somersault over some horses, Reka missed his distance,
fell on the last horse and broke his back. The sure-
footed and keen-eyed black, who can climb the sheer
trunks of trees that a white man would shudder to try at,
generally comes to grief when he attempts the tricks that
a white fellow thinks nothing of.

a big audience in a big building for the first time, fetched
an encore for her “When the Heart is Young.”

The cinematographe is the most wonderful illusion of
the century. It is to the camera obscura (to which
it has been unthinkingly likened) what the modern
photograph is to the old scissored silhouette.
True, it is as yet imperfect, a cin-etc. picture being
like something viewed through continuous flashes
°£ lightning or a storm of rain, an unpleasant
effect due to electric vibration. When this is reme-
died, and further inventive genius solves the photo-
graphic-reproduction of color problem and allies it to the
above marvel, optical illusion will have reached its ulti-
mate. Given a by-that-time perfected phonograph and
cinematographe, and the 2ist century will still see and
hear all that was famous in the 20th.

women enter as if just arrived by steamer. A Customs
officer of the zealous stamp suspects them of smug-
ghng, and insists on them removing their various gar-
ments for inspection. Just imagine a clever music-hall
Frenchman in such a part and you will have a slight idea
of the disgusting pantomime that keeps the house in roars
of excited laughter. A coarse can-can closes the indecent
sketch.

also Mendelssohn’s overture to “Midsummer Night’s

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Oct. 6,, 1:896i
Mr Dear Myee—
A very thin house was a depressing’ circum-
stance of Monday’s performance of “ The Rivals,’”
though the gorgeous Malaprop and Languish;
gowns helped to raise the spirits of the scattered;
few present. This much-paragraphed vesture,
quite came up to advance descriptions. LydSa’s-
(Miss Elliot) first allurement was of blue taffeta,
bunched over a white silk petticoat; her seconds
triumph showed salmon-pink blushing through a
white chiffon, paniers and trappings caught with’;
roses and long grasses; her celebrated jetty hair
was hanging down her back. Altogether she was
aradiantvisionof loveliness. Aunt (Miss Mortimer)
trailed some yards of expensive pink brocade
behind her as a Watteau train; afterwards, ditto
in yellow over white lace skirt, and showed too.
brief glimpses of a red-heeled shoe in the minuet..
Minus his curl-papers the bashful Bob Acres was
a wee, modest, crimson-tipped flower in canary
smalls. Gertrude Elliott, as Lucy, gratified her
fancy for scarlet by coming out dyed red all over.
Mrs. Ponderbury’s past was so long ago and such
a very little one—for it consisted of a single kiss
merely—that a fashionable first - night audience
might, but for the aggressiveness of her protesta-
tions of virtue, have condoned it entirely. Be-
sides, Mrs. Brough looked much too pretty as the
rampageous Lucretia to quite convince us that
even Rumford’s version of the affair wasn’t under-
drawn and faintly-colored. Moreover, no husband
in his senses would shy at having to personally
conduct the wearer of that first-act gown—made
of silk of a confused-looking floral pattern of many
colors, green coming uppermost in the struggle.
The bodice had some cunningly-arranged black:
and white chiffon and a new idea in sleeves which
gave a hint at once to every woman in the d.c.;;
the bonnet was like a bunch of watercress with up-
standing roses nodding k la mode, also the
velvet cloak was good to look at. Last year’s trip.
’Ome gave Mrs. B. many valuable suggestions,
about stage-dressing, and, being a clever woman,,
she has carried them out to the pleasure of her ad-
mirers but to the utter destruction of our faith ini
the probability of Ponderbury.
Emma Temple isn’t half garish enough in her’
garments for her part, but her description of the.
recent Inglis-Hamilton wedding is likely to be one.
of the hits of the piece. At first, the audience
didn't quite catch on, but when they got over their-
puzzlement, they roared appreciatively. Kathe-
rine Hardy has a festive gown of apricot silk and;
puffy white lace. The whole play has been given,
a liberal suit of whitewash by the English adaptor,
but it is extremely thin in spots, with large bare,
patches here and there, where the suit has given
way at the seams. There are signs that even a,
coat of whitewash would have been useful to veil
the situation in the original second act. The first,
night’s top-dressing on the Nicest ran mainly to gay
and glittering theatre coats, which, however be-
spangled, give a woman the appearance of having’
walked out in a glorified dressing-jacket. There
was one cape, with gigantic hood, reminiscent of
Camille, but not, alas, the Potter profile to be set.
off therewith. A new musical idea was the.
“Bicycle Fantasia,” played between the acts,,
descriptive of the joys and troubles of the rolling-
wheel. It was very bright, and quite loud enough,
to be sometimes audible above the cackle.
The vice-regal presence gave tone to the first;
dajr’s sports of N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union, an aggre-
gation of clubs bound together in the silken bonds,
of trying to find the best lily-white amateur to.
represent Australasia in England. His Ex. was
chiefly occupied in struggling with a jibbing-
starting-pistol which refused to pop when asked,
and went off at odd moments to the surprise of
everybody, even the firer. There was a pensive
droop about the proceedings—except the band,
which was going strong to the last, and some of
the grand-stand raiment, which quarrelled cruelly
among its component parts. The new “ tulip ’”
parasol abounded on the lawn; worn with taste,
it is a graceful fancy, but a purple-and-pink
“ tulip ” shading a magenta-flowered hat and
vesture of yellow muslin really yells at passers-by.
Among the riders, I principally noticed one with
large white shoes which made his feet look like
washing-bundles, but which flashed around first to
the winning-post; also, the well-known amateur
with the smile which was once said to have bent
the corner of a country race-track.
An enterprising tea-room proprietor has devised
an original livery for his waitresses. They are to

Some of the women in the West could tell heroic
stories if they chose. They don’t generally, and
therein lies the heroism. I heard lately of a girl
in Kalgoorlie who supports, by type-writing, her
father, mother and seven brothers and sisters. She
saved in Perth .£25 to enable her to go to the field,
and, on leaving, placed most of the amount in her
sisters’ hands; she arrived in Hannan’s with 3d.
For three months she slept on the bare ground,
but now is in full work and coins money. There
is no moral to this story except that hard luck
usually doesn’t last with smart people.
Spirits are very attentive to wealthy widows. It
is probably solely the devotion of the disembodied
ones to rich men’s relics that booms the business
at all. In a Vic. seaside town there is a diamond-
drill at work boring for coal through a sandstone
bluff, in obedience to directions received per ghost
at a guinea stance with the lights turned down
and the moneyed novice in the room. The pro-
moters of the search haven’t come to coal yet (nor
to the bottom of the widow’s purse), but they are
still boring enthusiastically. Another much-
gilt lady has been standing a siege of begging-
letters from the sheeted and oofless dead for some
time past. They arrived by post through a noted
medium from the perturbed spirit of her husband,
and were all on the same lines—making an im-
passioned appeal that conscience money be at once
paid to the “ meejum ” on the perturbed spirit’s
behalf, whereby much coin would ultimately flow
into the pockets of the would-be payee, a tried
and trusted and named friend of deceased. As the
widow had some prudence she showed the letters
to her brother and others having authority and—
■well, now there is a row.
At her own fancy-dress ball Mrs. J. R. Wood
appeared as Juliet
. The man who hired a cab by the month and used
it as a dwelling house, only getting out for his
meals, has been imitated in Sydney recently. A
lavish person with plenteous coin paid a cabman
to drive him about indefinitely. After drifting
round a block or two the capitalist would declare a
dividend and hand up a sov. through the trap-hole.
This was repeated every mile or so until cabby
felt that he had struck a portable gold-mine.
While the lode lasted it yielded £2(l a day.
Another Croesus spilling his wealth around just
now. is staying at a Southern hotel and getting rid
of his annual .£20,000 or so in a manner recalling
the brave days of old. He never demeans himself
by accepting change, and allows the waiters five
shillings on every bottle of champagne; also, it is
recorded that he met the same waiter about the
hotel five times before breakfast and gave him a
'sovereign every time.
But people of this sort are rare now-a-days.
During the recent Sydney race-week there were in
town at least ten young bachelors not one of whom
had an income of less than £5OOO a year. And,
:so far as the public reputation of those ten young
men goes, there was not one of them who would
■decline the change out of a shilling after having
jhis hair cut.
Experience of the long-drawn R.C. Melbourne
'Cathedral f£te has stimulated St. Mary’s Cathe-
dral authorities to arrange for next Easter a fair
run on similar lines, including race-games, tom-
bolas, and all the most popular coin-extracting
'schemes of the Melb. show. Up to date this
planet has seen no better money-raising instru-
ment than Mother Church. Money never smells
■once the faithful have a grip on it; while Angli-
oans and other Protestants are coquetting with
bazaar-raffles or observing dubiously on an
astonished eucalyptus a placard announcing a
dance for church funds, the robust Roman con-
science approves of raking in the shekels from all
■quarters. At St. Patrick’s fair women who have
revolted at the idea of backing their fancy at
Elemington came out many pounds to the bad
from the race-game. Nuns are now allowing
skirt-dancing in a mild form to be taught in con-
vent schools. They ought to smile on the worldly
pastime of dancing, seeing that the light fantastic
toe has been tripped for Sydney R.C. charities
this year to the tune of £l3OO at four large balls.
Perhaps the above substantial pedal - action
results have led to a “Trilby” cult among the
orthodox. A vendor of church requisites in the
bead-and-charm line has in his window a big stack
of copies of the book of the beautiful bunionless
one—-flanked by piles of works labelled “Garden
of the Soul ” and “ Eunctions of Mary,” and sur-
rounded by adoring plaster saints.
. Art-unions, if put down in one form, will arise
in another. They are too useful to needy human
nature to be “ hurled into obscurity,” as the arch-
deacon of Hobart phrased it at the Synod. A year
or two back a gilded maiden I wot of was induced
by her art-instructor to buy a whole bookful of
chances to secure all or any of eight or eleven
masterpieces which he had just dashed off with
impressionist effects of pink rocks washed by violet
sea-spray, and purple gulls flying in a red-ochre
sky. After many unsuccessful attempts to form
other ’eart-unions with Australian heiresses, who
weren t taking anything in imported painter at
that time, he ultimately left for Europe, and now
holds shows advertised by royalty. But the date
of his art-union drawing has not yet been fixed.
The thousands of people who knew that plucky
and clever old lady, Mrs. Carl Eischer, will be
grieved to hear of her death, which took place
early on Tuesday morning. Mrs. Eischer was
connected with one or other of the Fairfaxes’
papers for many years, and did a vast amount of
good journalistic work in Sydney.
In a gushing notice of the increase of a pro-
minent citizen’s family, an up-country paper
makes a funny printer’s error. “ Mrs. Blank pre-
sented her husband with duplicate olive branches
on Thursday—twin sins ! ”
Rosehill on Monday was a surging mass Of
crowd and sandwich-paper, diversified with th*
mangled remains of a mountain of Sydney’s
national fruit. Whenever the people turn-out in
their thousands like that, it wouldn’t be a bad idea
to stand a few dozen waste-baskets around to
receive fragments, and make the place look less
like a wrecked marmalade-factory next door to a
ruined paper-mill. Assorted games went on all
day, under the guidance of the Eight-Hour
Demonstration Committee, in white hats with
blue ribbon badges—who gracefully posed before
the camera-man during the afternoon and had
their photos, taken. In this gathering I missed
two sights familiar in the corresponding Mel-
bourne demonstration—there were no ‘‘down-
with-sweating ” placards in the procession, and no
pert little misses with short frocks, tight waists
and carefully-touzled hair in the crowd. The
latter product of civilisation seems indigenous
only to the Southern city. Sydney has some
things to be thankful for.
A certain very, very pretty actress and her com-
pany were lately travelling by train. The train
was uncomfortably crowded, and the ladies were
cooped up with a squalling baby in the rear of the
sleeper. Everyone in the men’s end of the car was
up and dressed except the occupant of an upper
berth, when the fascinating mummer and her com-
panion came in and sat talking with friends. The
ladies’ end of the sleeper was being made up and
there was no place to sit. The actress explained this
politely to the upper-berth man when he put his
head out and requested the ladies to withdraw,
but he happened to be a very modest man, and
consequently, became very angry indeed. Being
unable to divine his feelings, the lady became angry
too, and said his toilette had no charms for her,
but she would sit where she was and look stead-
fastly out of the window—which she did amidst
the laughter of the other passengers. But if she
had known who her now raging and furious fellow-
passenger was she would probably have spared his
blushes.
I am told that the wife of baronet Clarke, who
had organised a swell entertainment in aid of a
consumptive hospital, was almost worried out of
her wits by the demands of the Board of Health,
who ordered that half-a-dozen doors in the ball-
room of the East Melbourne mansion be taken
down, another half-dozen swung outwards instead
of inwards, a platform erected near the windows
so that people might jump out easily in ease of
fire, and an entire re-arrangement of lighting and
seating accommodation, in case the place blew up
through the blaze of society gems. The lady
enquired the.penalty if all this were not done, and
the Board said “gaol.” She signified her readi-
ness to go there as the quickest way of meeting
the difficulty. Then the Board refused to allow
the entertainment to take place unless the altera-
tions were made. And made they had to be at
great cost.
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.
“Do you apply for bail ?” sweetly asked
Sydney P.M. Addison of an accused. “Yes, your
Worship.” “Why, the prisoner’s serving a
sentence now,” said a policeman. “How dare
you apply for bail, sir, when you are serving a
sentence in gaol already?’’thundered Mr. Addison.
“ Ah, really—l had quite forgotten all about it,”
blandly answered the prisoner. He might have
added that he didn’t ask the beak; the beak
asked him.
That part of the N.S.Wi Civil Service
whose screw was reduced by the Commission, got
its reduction promptly on Ist July. That part of
it which got its salary increased—though the in-
creases were also supposed to date from Ist July—
hasn't seen a penny of the extra salary yet. It
was understood that everything would be paid up
when the estimates were passed by the Assembly,
and when they got through last month the Service
rushed out and ordered its new suit on the strength
of it. Then Ist Oct. came and nothing happened,
just as before, and if The Bulletin printed the
Service’s present candid opinion of G. H. Reid, it
would get the editor three months at the very least.
In Sydney the policeman makes a point of
bailing-up and cross-questioning any poorly-
dressed man who may be carrying a bag, while
the “ swell ” passes unchallenged. Yet, as a
matter of fact, thieves are often better-dressed
than honest men. Example : A man with a
dozen aliases has been sent up by Judge Coffey
for 54 years, i.e., for 6 years on each of nine
charges, the sentences to run concurrently. The
man dressed fashionably, drove a smart sulky,
called at houses ostensibly on business, and
“ lifted ” whatever jewellery he could find in the
absence of the owners. He passed daily under
the noses of the police, and was only bowled out
through the information of a pal.
A poor, miserable, drink-sodden indivi-
dual loaded himself with blue-metal last Thursday
night and went to N.S.W. Parliament House to
“deal it out” to members of the Assembly.
Dacey, M.L.A. for Botany, was upbraiding sundry
legislators for decrying the labors and abilities of
aldermen: “It is all very well for honorable
gentlemen to cast stones in this light and airy
manner at aldermen ” when the alcoholised
stranger, with a vague idea of the appropriateness
of his action, forthwith hurled two rocks at him.
Drink had so shattered his nerves that though the
house was full he failed in two shots to hit any-
thing harder than the floor. He was promptly
dragged forth and handed over to the police.
Thank Heaven, Australia is a law-abiding place.
In an older civilisation those stones might have
been bombs.
Time deals gently with the woman who
uses “Babeskin” soap. It softly removes the
tell-tale lines of the years, and renews the delicate
bloom of youth. One shilling packages of two

The Melb.-newspaper story that Julian
Thomas (“The Vagabond”) was “in 1870 and
thereabouts a cicerone to rich Americans, explain-
ing to them everything connected with Old Paris,
and that he was also an occasional worshipper in
the Notre Dame de Nazareth Synagogue, and was
known by the name of Sarfati,” looks somewhat
improbable, for “ The Vag.” was not a sufficiently
good linguist to successfully bear either an Italian
or a French name.
Essie, lately Juliet,
Maidenly-named Capulet,
How does married life suit you,
Wedded to It. Montague ?
Do you miss the vaulted gloom
Of your ancient family tomb ?
Or regret that tragedy
Luckily has passed you by ?
How does Romeo fill the bill,
Has he ina-in-law’s ill-will ?
Is he always home to dine—
Ever mention Rosaline ?
“ Bounty boundless as the sea,”
“ Love as deep ” —your maiden plea—
All that speech ’bout Phoebus’ horse,
Can you still the above endorse ?
After years of wedded bliss
Other parts now come amiss:
You above them all still set
Name of loving Juliet.

All Australia to a bar of soap that the jury
in a certain big trial, proceeding as this is written,
will disagree.
Two of the Yictorian Judges are heavy
losers, as shareholders in the late City of Me -
bourne Bank.
A leading Yic. Presbyterian clergyman
savs that journalists—as a class are no friends of
the churches. The World, the Flesh, and the
P Journalist : “ Though Pastor Fitchett
helped to ruin the Melb. Daily #eleoraph,
Hancock ought to get him to run the new morn-
ing paper.”
King Billy, the last of the Ercildoune
(Vie.) aboriginals, has been found dying ma ditch
by the roadside, and removed in a cart to the hos-
pital. King Sammy, of Ercildoune, was not found
dying in a ditch.
ONE FOR HIS NOB.
REV. MR. SNUFFLER: “ Yes, my dear lady, I consider that the nude is always indecent.”
MISS SMARTY: “ Then, pray how do you account for that naked head of yours? ”
It is a coincidence that the son of the
foreman of the jury in a very momentous current
case is employed in the office of the leading pri-
soner’s son.
Pastor Fitchett is the most rapid of jour-
nalists. He leaves his Review of Reviews sum-
mary to the last moment. Then rattles it off to a
stenographer.
South Australian Govt. Gazette notice :
“ Constable Napoleon Bonaparte Catchlove has
been appointed inspector of slaughter-houses and
skins of slaughtered animals.”
SouthMelb. Orphanage public subscription-
list is headed “Lord Brassey, 10s.” “Ten-bob
in conjunction with a millionaire Governor s name
looks—well, it looks almost blasphemous.
Recent advices from England would lead
to the belief that Mr. Justice Innes will not again
take his seat upon the N.S.W. Bench, but on
returning to Australia will retire on pension.
Troy: “ The last time I saw Yerdon in
business, he was obsequiously showing Lord Car-
narvon to his carriage, out of the Melb. E.S. and
A. Bank. What shadows we are, and what
shadows we pursue ! ”
Ex-Yic. M.L.C. William Campbell left
.£347,544 personality; value of real estate not
given. He left the bulk of his property to his
children. The charities of Victoria, where he
accumulated his pile, are not mentioned.
William Luxton, of Corowa (N.S.W.), was,
it is stated, one of the Balaclava Six Hundred.
He received a pension, but transferred it years
ago to his mother, and now makes ends meet by
driving a wood-cart. A theme for Kipling.
Old Jock Nimmo’s reverence for Bobby
Burns, which was a Melbourne joke eight or ten
years ago, may have been a sort of heirloom in the
family. The poet was first introduced to his
“Clarinda” at the house of a Miss Nimmo, m
Edinburgh.
Col. Madley, appointed to succeed the late
Mr. Peterswald as Commissioner of Police in
S.A., would have been made Inspector General
of Schools in place of Mr. Hartley had that gentle-
man died a week earlier. Now the Colonel
declines to be transferred from the former to the
latter post.
Pastor Fitchett may be annoyed at the
publicity given to his authorship of the “Bleeds
that won the Empire,” but he has spent much
trouble of late months in endeavoring to have
them in a collected form (for which, presumably,
he is to be paid), appointed to be read in the publio
schools of Australasia.
Singular how many old military officers,
after a life of slaughter, lapse into prayerful reli-
giosity, while clergymen hanker after gore. Thus,
while Major-General Tulloch, late v ic. Military
Commandant, devotes his leisure to solving the
problem of how the Children of Israel crossed the
Red Sea, Pastor Fitchett wallows in blood and
slime and revels in smoke and battle-dust in his
yawps about British fights.
Mahlstick : “Fred. Barnard, whose death
through a smoking-in-bed accident is cabled, was
not altogether a successful limner. The reason
was the common mistake of trying to force a dead,
played-out style on a changed public, instead of
taking his cue. In short, he would not draw. So
he was greasy, with all his invention, and had not
the clientele of effete Gilbert, Cruikshank, Leech,
Phiz, Kenny Meadows, &c.”
John Howard Angas, reputedly the
wealthiest man in S.A., was 73 on Oct. 5. His
father lived to be 90, and the son looks as active
and full of life now as most men do at 50. He still
personally superintends all his big business, and
at every show is to be seen admiring his stud cattle
or sheep. Angas pere, among other things,
founded the wealthy South Australian Co., the
now defunct Bank of S.A., and the Union Bank,
which swallowed it up.
Yic. Ministry did a graceful thing by
Premier Turner, the other evening, in the form of
a cafe dinner, to mark the second anniversary of
his accession to office. Isaacs, on behalf of his
brethren, presented their modest ruler with a gold
bracelet and brooch for his wife, who, in her way,
assists the Government by taking Turner for a
blow down St. Kilda pier whenever she can catch
the indefatigable attorney off duty.
Spagnoletti : “The soldier is the most
consummate ass on this planet, the mere jumping-
jack firework cracker of a Bonaparte, Bismarck,
or even of a Gladstone, who would never declare
war on Asia, if he had to fight himself. Just as
Melb. boils over with enthusiasm on a newspaper
discussion over the Balaclava Charge, it is found
that one of the Six Hundred, after 30 years’ slow
starvation, is actually dying on the spot.”
Lines written by the late N.S.W. Chief
Justice Stephen about himself some 40 years ago :
The late Chief Justice, by the way, once con-
tributed (anonymously) to The Bulletin a set of
verses embodying what must have been about all
the sentiment his chilly nature had to spare.

MARTIN , THE CYCLIST.
One of the late Julian Thomas’s many
anecdotes was located at Ballyhegney, a back-
block township in the wilds of Tipperary, which
he struck when suffering from acute rheumatism
in the knee. Casting his luggage into the only
pub., “the Vag.” tumbled into bed, and asked
that a doctor be called. “ Divil a docthor is
there, at all, at all, fur this twinty mode,” said
the boniface, “but,” he observed confidentially,
“there’s a cousin av moine, a vet., he’s a power-
ful clever man, an’ he threats us all. “Fetch
him,” groaned the suffering visitor, and some
minutes later the learned leech was disturbed
from his work of forking manure, and ushered
into the bedroom. “ The Vag.,” however, des-
cribed his symptoms, the other seized, his wrist,
and, assuming an air of profound wisdom, sat
silent for about lOsec. Then he pulled down the
coverlet and began prodding the invalid’s chest
with his knuckles. A dozen knocks, and the
pressman let out: “What the devil are you
doing ? I’ve got rheumatism in the leg. ’ The vet.
did not look up, but, waving a hand, imperiously
exclaimed—“ Whisht! It’s all the same to the
faculty.” Which it probably was.
Higinbotham told Man-
nington Caffyn, his Brighton
neighbor, that he didn’t wish
to be remembered by a picture
or a statue.
‘ ‘ Be grave ! Be grave ! ”
is Colonial Secretary Brun-
ker’s special form of exhorta-
tion when Want begins to
tell N.S.W. Cabinet the sort
of laws the community re-
quires.
“Yesterday (Aug. 16),”
writes a travelling Australian
to The Bulletin from Lon-
don, “I lunched with Hori
Grey—ah ! so old, feeble, and
almost voiceless now. For an
hour I sat beside him listen-
ing to his low, whispered
tones. He talked to me of
our side of the world, and as
he spoke his dimmed eyes
lighted up and a faint smile
came to his pallid lips. Our
hostess —a charming, graceful
woman (a daughter of Richard
Gobden) —treated the old war-
rior with such reverent re-
spect that my heart went out
to her with a jump. By-and-
bye, as we sat by a window
overlooking a park, a waving
mass of green (’twas in Here-
ford Square), he pressed my
hand —‘You and I have seen
places more beautiful,’ _ he
said ; ‘ but yet, how dear it is
to be so near Nature and God,’
and his tremulous hand point-
ed to the trees beneath. Old,
so old. Yet brain so clear,
and in his eyes that strange,
patient look that says ‘My
day is done; lam waiting for
the End.’ He lives but a
short distance away, and, with
myhostess’shusband, I walked
home with him. We stood a
little while on the doorstep,
and as he turned to me with
his weak old hand held out
and said in a whisper ‘You
will come and see me some-
times, won’t you ? ’ I could
only bend my head and turn
away.”
Like Mr. Gillen, who has just died,
O’Loughlin, the new S.A. Lands Commissioner,
was born in the province, of Irish parents. He is
a Catholic, and a teetotaller. The deceased
Minister and his successor lived in the same hotel
rooms when in the city attending Parliament, and
they were bosom friends. O’Loughlin is 42 years
old, and has always voted on the Democratic
side, but he will add little strength to the Ministry.
John Douglas, now visiting the South,
when Q. Premier declared the whole Chinese
Empire an infected port. It was in the days
of the Palmer rush, and cute Brisbane mer-
chants were importing eager Chinese in bat-
talions sometimes at the rate of 1000 a
week. Very frequently these proved leprous or
insane, and became a charge on the province.
Douglas passed an Act imposing a <£lo poll-tax,
and even this mild guarantee was to be returned
if the immigrant proved sound in mind and limb.
But Downing-street, much more bumptious then,
refused to concur. Douglas seized on a case of
small-pox and a bright idea, quarantined every
vessel arriving from China, and at one time had
4000 Chinese in durance on Fitzroy Island, near
Cairns. That stopped the invasion. Quarantine
charges knocked all the profit out of the business,
and the Brisbane traders dropped it suddenly.
But Douglas couldn’t manage to send his 4000
back, and by degrees they drifted into circulation.

On the last day on which S.A. Assembly

Yic. Chief Justice Madden invariably
writes out his more important judgments at home,
and apparently seizes upon the handiest piece e;
paper, irrespective of its contents, for the purpose
The obverse side of his decisions is often amusing
and occasionally startling to the outsider. Invi-
tations for “Sir John’s” presence at Soanso's
garden-party are, of course, commonplace enough,
but when bills for bear’s-grease and moustache
wax from fashionable hairdressers are handed frote
the bench an audible smile occasionally arises,

Of children this knight had no less than eighteen,
Twice nine little heads with a marriage between ;
He had nine when a barrister, nine when a judge,
And of “ sex”—since to Nature he owed not a grudge—
Nine exactly were girls, the other half hoys,
An equal division ‘twixt quiet and noise ;
While if by marriage the number be reckoned
There were nine of the first and nine of the second.
Nine in Tasmania, nine New South Wales ;
Then (to show with what justice he still held the scales),
Since nine it was clear he could not divide
(A third sex yet having never been tried),
Five sons and four daughters in Hobart were born,
That four sons, five daughters might Sydney adorn !
Twin daughters, twin sons, complete the strange story
Of this patron of “ wigs," though constant old Tory.

only Kingston and Cockburn will remain of the
Ministry formed by Kingston in 1893.
t{ A Sydney Sunday paper calls the C. of E.
the State Church.” Not in Australia. Australia
is not taking any State Church, and never will.
A Maoriland paper states red, white, and
blue are the British colors. Wrong. The British
colors are a streak of white on a ground of black,
brown, and yellow.
Premier Reid’s Colored Races Restriction
Bill contains a clause specially exempting from
its operations the native races of “Australia,
Maoriland and Tasmania.” And Tasmania is
thoughtful. l The ghost of Truganir; will be
delighted.
How does “ Lands ” Minister Carruthers
square. it with his Preetrade conscience to place
disabilities on Victorian incomers into N.S.W.
who want to take up land in the latter province ?
The “God-fearing” Ministry’s foreign-trade gospei
is largely leavened with protectionism.
It seems certain now that the Vic. teeto-
tallers will be against the Turner Ministry at next
election. Turner can’t promise them all they want
for he is the man with the majority, and would
have to make good his promises. The man with
the hopeless minority can safely promise anything.
Apparently it was Sydney Telegraph’s
articles on the “Evils of State Banking” which
caused Premier Reid’s sudden change of front on
this question. G. Reid’s proprietor, boss, and
political director issued his ukase that there was
to be no State Bank of Issue, and G. Reid re-
spectfully obeys.
N.S.W municipalities, in talking about
refusing the Govt, endowment of <£65,000, unless
the a Mermen are allowed to spend the money
without restriction or State supervision, recall
an old story. Solid citizen has given half-a-
crown to Lugbiter. S.C. : “Now, look here
don’t you go and spend that in drink.” Lu°--
biter (grandly): “Sir-r! It’s like your insolence
to try to dictate to me as to how I shall spend my
money! ”

The Labor
members in every
Australian Parlia-
ment xi os s essing
such a party are
cons p i c u ous for
hostility to the
Parlia mentar y
grog-bar. They
are also by 50 per
cent, more regular
i n their atten-
dances, and sit, on
an average, three
hours longer x>er
day than other
non -Ministers.
As a set-off, how-
ever, there are
among them, per-
haps 80 per cent,
more Sunday tub-
thumpers and amateur theologians than among
other members taken altogether.
In a Southern province it has been fashion-
able for Tory writers to declare that the Labor
M’sP. are invariably “ men who have failed in
business,” and then point the moral that such men
are unfit to assist in governing. And now one
reads that the firm headed by the chief god of the
National Ass has failed for a gigantic sum.
Curtis, M.L.A. (Rockhampton) in Banana-
land Assembly : —“ A referendum (re Separation)
would excite a popular controversy. It might
have the effect of organising whatever anti-Sepa-
raKtion feeling and opinion may exist.” The voice
of the Rockhampton corner-allotment man who
fears the unfavorable verdict of the Backblocks !
Apropos of recent proceedings and loyalty
to the Queen. During the discussion of a postal
measure in Yic. Leg. Council Johnny Fawkner,
the alleged founder of Melbourne, proposed that
it should be a penal offence to affix a postage-
stamp to a,n envelope head downwards. Even the
Conservative Upper House couldn’t stomach that.
From the fact that N.S.W. Government,
without taking Parliament into its confidence,
conceded on Ist Jan., 1895, to the then Governor
the right to frank all his letters through the post,
the inference is drawn that there was truth in the
rumor of the mutually - admiring relations of
Premier Reid and Gov. Duff about the time
mentioned.
Last week’s work at Sydney Benevolent
Asylum included grants to 1977 cases of destitu-
tion representing 8221 adults and children—this
despite the recent despatch of hundreds of unem-
ployed to do scrub-cutting on the Bogan ! At the
end of July there were on the society’s books 1880
cases representing 7330 persons, so the rapidity
with which things are getting no better is obvious.
Papa Brunker (N.S.W. Colonial Secre-
tary) is on the horns of a dilemma. West
Maitland has a spick - and - span new court-
house, which, the residents say, will be a white
elephant if Quarter Sessions and Assize Courts
are not held there. East Maitlanders say that if
“Papa” consents to shift the superior Courts’
business from the East his seat will be to let at
next election.
Wrixon mournfully remarked the other
day that he was afraid “ the young Australian
colonies were departing from the old Anglo-Saxon
method of reforming the Constitution, which (the
method) was to wait, in order to ascertain if any
evils required to be remedied. Wrixon’s idea
seems to be that it is better political form to wait
for the doctor, or even the undertaker, than to call
in the sanitary inspector.
The recent autonomy debate in Banana-
land Assembly turned out a terrible fiasco —for
Separation. Only 14 members (all Labor) sup-
ported Kidston’s motion recommending the re-
ferring of the matter to a referendum, Northern
and Centralian Fat-Man Ms.L. A. stoutly support-
ing the Govt. By the way, Northern Queensland
(which, unfortunately, is quite indifferent to
Separation) has now a population of 91,000, while
Cantralia numbers about 54,000. And Autonomy
cannot count on one poor 10,000 supporters.
A FAIR DIVISION.
MISS SMITH M.B. : “ The etiquette of the profession requires that I should call
upon you, as lam the new-comer. lam going to settle here to practise.”
HE : “ Well, the practice isn’t enough for two—hut I suppose we will divide it.”
MISS SMITH : "Yes, we'll divide it. I’ll take all the births, and you can take all
the deaths .”
Premier Reid is steadily settling down
into the old M‘Millan-Parkes variety of Revenue
Tariffism, and the new Democratic Freetrade
movement is growing weak. It is distinctly pro-
mised teat the Land-tax is never to go further
than Id. in the £. The Customs are still to be one
of the principal sources of revenue—and are to
yield far more than the vaunted direct taxation.
The beer, wine, whisky and tobacco industries are
to be “ incidentally protected ” as heretofore. The
reform of the Upper House, the State Bank, the
Local Government Bill, the State Land Bank—all
seem to be dead. The proposal to make the State
the sole issuer of paper currency has dropped.
The Old Age Pension scheme, which has been a
good deal talked about of late, doesn’t seem to be
an item of the Government programme—the only
men who appear to take much interest in it are
the Labor Party and a few Oppositionists. The
Ministry mildly compromises with the Council
when the two bodies knock against each other
now; in fact, the new Freetrade lion has practi-
cally left off roaring.
Fraser, M.L.C., said recently that were it
not for the export of frozen meat God knows where
Victoria would be now. If Victoria were to ex-
port a few frozen M’sL.C. her whereabouts might
be even better known to the Almighty.
TALK BETWEEN KISSES.
(As overheard at a Sorrento hotel.)
HE : “ What do you think I had for dinner, pet? ”
SHE: “ Was it something dreadful?” —(Another long caress.)
HE: “ Sucking pig!”
SHE : “ Dearest, I never would have guessed it.”
According to Attorney-General Want, the
present N.S.W. electoral law is so strangely and
wonderfully arranged that the existing electoral
rights expire at the end of ’96, and no provision is
made for issuing new ones till 1899, and unless
things are altered the whole province will be
totally disfranchised for two years. Consequently
when the present Parliament expired no one would
be able to elect a new one, and representative
Government would drop through a large hole into
somewhere and vanish entirely.
Tozer was accused the other day, in Banana-
land Assembly, of sending Detective Clarke to
Rockhampton in order to ascertain who were fit
and proper persons to be jurymen in the Ayrshire
Downs arson case. He answered the charge
thus: “Surely it was not an improper thing to
find out accurately whether any man on the jury-
list was prejudiced or interested, from relationship
or other causes !! ” Sounds like a chapter from
the history of Castle government in Ireland.
It is believed that if he can manage the
political double-shuffle in Westralian scrip, pluto-
crat Solomon will be ready to take Treas. Holder’s
place in S.A. Govt, when that gentleman goes to
London as Agent-General. Solomon was whip to
ther Downer Ministry which Kingston displaced,
but he has thrown over the Opposition because he
was not consulted about the appointment of Copley
as leader. Solomon began political life as a
Liberal in 1890, but deserted to become stipendiary
whip to the Playford Government.
Out of 15 councillors in South Melb.
Council, five are house-agents. These, or some of
them, work the rolls pretty much as they please,
because the average tenant doesn’t care a rap
whether he is entitled to vote at municipal elec-
tions or not. Quite recently a well-known South
Melb. citizen wrote to the Age re the candidature
of one house-agent:—“l heard a relative of Mr.
say that if he had known in time that Mr.
was going to stand, he would have had 60 or
70 more ratepayers on the roll.” Nevertheless,
the Age gravely assures its readers that anything
like American ward-politics or wire-pulling is un-
known in Victoria.
Re the suggestion that if the Jacob Garrard
pietists of N.S.W. Assembly want to begin Par-
liamentary business with prayer, it will be needful
for them to bait the members with a hunk of some
sort of advantage. Lately in the English Com-
mons, the Speaker’s attention was drawn to the
fact that Dilke entered the chamber, reserved a
seat, sneaked out just as prayers were about to
commence, and sneaked back to the reserved place
when they were over. Whereupon the Speaker
ruled: “No prayers, no reserved seat,” and the
baronet was forced to retire. How many cranks
would carry stones to the gallery of N.S.W.
Assembly, if it became noised abroad that certain
M’sL.A. would be found on the floor of the House
engaged in prayer !
Q. Premier Nelson’s statement that he had
paid the <£looo reward offered for the conviction
of the Ayrshire Downs woolshed incendiaries,
but that it would be injudicious to disclose the
names of the informers, sets The Bulletin won-
dering exactly how much truth there is in a recent
correspondent, who writes :
They say Major Le Caron is dead. Don’t vou believe it
This 25-years-spy for John Bull is flourishing in Q., under
Govt, protection. By the way, can you count the Irish
informers shipped into Q. police force, and finding a con-
genial occupation in denouncing alleged strike-outragers ?
I tried ; and gave it up at 28 or so.
Q. Labor-party might study the matter out; for
while no nobility can exceed that of one sort of
Irishman, no treachery, no perjury is too base to
be beneath the Irish informer !
The Chow displaces the European, and the
Jap in turn displaces the Chow. In the Sandwich
Islands, the natives were superseded by Chinkies,
and now the latter are outnumbered by Japs in the
proportion of two to one.
The Maoriland
Constitution A-
mendment Bill re-
duces the tenure of
seats in the nominee
Council to five years.
It is reckoned, on
the strength of pain-
ful experience, that
when a democrat is
sent to the Council —
where he is not re-
sponsible to the peo-
ple and is corrupted
by almost absolute
power so far as ob-
struction is concern-
ed —he is not likely
to remain even de-
cently democratic for
longer than that.
The Council has
vastly less work to
do than the House
of Representatives,
and it has no con-
stituents to woriy it
and keep it moving.
These things tend
to somnolence, and
somnolence tends to
stagnation, and stag-
nation means Con-
servatism. More-
over, the mere fact
that the Council has
little power to ad-
vance progressive
legislation and great
power to hinder it
makes it do the lat-
ter ; everybody has
a desire to use his
power, and he natu-
rally takes to using
whatever power he
has.
There are 42
drinking - clubs in
the police district of
Sydney, which pay
no licence, are not
inspected by the po-
lice, and can supply
liquor at practically
every hour of the
day and night from
Ist Jan. to 31st Dec.
There are similar
clubs all over the
province; the num-
ber of them is certainly over 200, and may be any-
thing up to 1000. What is the good of trying to
put down Sunday trading and trading after hours
in the licensed hotels while the law allows this
sort of thing ?
Martin, the Champion Cyclist.
A height of sft. 6in., a weight of 12st. stripped
in condition, an unexpanded chest-measurement
of 40iri., an invincible will, a cool, sensible brain,
and the most temperate and regular of habits,
make up the chief features of that successful and
universally-popular cyclist, Martin—writes a well-
known sporting authority to The Bulletin. He
is a man who lives his athlete’s life wholly ; he is
stronger because of other men’s weaknesses. He
is an athletic paragon, eating and drinking only
what is good; a perfect clock in punctuality and
thoroughness at work ; as steady as an ascetic
when work is done. At 9.5 every night the man
who holds the scalps of all Australian cyclists is
in bed dead asleep. What match for him the men
who dig their graves in the midnight, and then on
the morrow, with jaded spirits and wearied
bodies, challenge this strong and rested man to a
bitter call upon the vital forces? Martin is a
study in muscle. He owes his sturdy physique to
Irish parentage and a life-time of muscular training.
Martin’s muscle has a history of four years spent
in the toils of the sea between the ages of 13 and
17; a record of jumping and long-distance run-
ning with a top effort of half-a-mile in 2min. 2sec. ;
a chronicle of systematic gymnastic work. Behind
Martin’s shoulder there is a ball of muscle which
is his referee when a row starts ; it should
knock skin and hair off a locomotive.
Martin first cycled six years ago. One of his
great feats was winning a six days and nights
wheel-race in ’9l in New York city. He rode 1466
miles with 11 hours’ sleep, and came in first, lead-
ing the second man by 25 miles. All the world’s
long-distance cyclists broke up that time. Not
long ago Martin was holding out a challenge to
race any three N.S.W. cyclists over 25 miles, a
fresh opponent at every miles. Nobody could
see his way clear to oblige Martin, however. The
great 25-mile match with M'Donell was a case of
boss rooster v. chicken. Martin broke his leg by
falling oft a high-wheeler in a race; after the
crash he remounted before discovering that his
was a case for splints. This accident makes his
right leg nearly an inch shorter than the left. In
Europe he raced at a weight of from 1501 b. to
1551 b. ; this year he is racing at from 16olb. to
1751 b. What is Martin’s age ? It’s the one ques-
tion he won’t answer. “Anyhow,” he remarks,
“ whenever they beat me it will be no credit to
them, because they will beat an old man and a
cripple. ”

A Clarion (Eng.) writer burns a little in-
cense at the altar of Lovely Woman —“Both
physically and mentally she has improved, and ia
still improving. I can’t deny that she is still too
much the slave'of Fashion, but even the feeblest
followers of that goddess are more independent,
more self-reliant, less artificial than the most ad-
vanced women of twenty-five years ago.” Mean-
time an American paper—and America raises its
hat to the fair sex higher than any other country
on earth—declares that the New Woman is being
physically and morally ruined by the bike.

abroad S e ß,fr ld Bay ?’” writes an Australian
aoroad to Thu Bulletin, from London “that the real
Stoddart’s th t troable „ wlth Stoddart was as thus: On
Sheffield t 0 Eng - Wlth his famous team, Lord
StoddqH- Hp k r d ! lm *?, P ,a y a ma tch at Sheffield Park,
to mlf ninf ,° n tl J e tf r s und that the earl was trying
iwwuf f hIS laurels and P et moat of the glory, with
which the team were supposed to land in England, con-
centrated on himself. This was too much for Lord S
wno will never forgive the insulting insinuation. ’’
“ The dismissal of Gloucester county for 17 bv
Trumble and M‘Kibbin, was due to good-length bowling
SJ l iTr-u^ ket thafc would do almost anything asked of it
M liibbin was certainly breaking a foot, and Trumble'
from away up from his 6ft. 3in., of which he makes full
use as a bowler, was dropping them in a nasty place and
no batsman on earth could tell what was going to happen.
“ The attempt of E. M. Grace to turn the
hundred or so people off the Cheltenham ground who had
come back to see him play Donnan a single-wicket game
was on a par with the generally overbearing manner of
• aa s . ecretar y of the Gloucester
County Cricket Club, imagines that he, as a matter of
divine right, owns the grounds on which the matches are
played. It was particularly impudent on this occasion, as
the small crowd consisted entirely of poor devils who had
paid their money and had sat through the rain to even-
tually see three overs.
Gregory s 71 against Gloucestershire was a
great performance on a bad wicket, and far and away
ahead of anyone else’s both in style and hitting power
He gave no chance and couldn’t be got out.
“ Harry Musgrove intends to set a good exam-
ple to future managers by balancing his books and pavino-
every member his dividend on the English tour on the
Sunday before the team leave for America. As this will
not be printed until long after it is all over and the money
safely invested, intending borrowers derive no advantage
from this information.” s

The Bulletin is told that about the first (if not
the very first) man to make his 100 in interprovincial
cricket (Vic. and N.S.W.), now in his old age, humps his
swag- about the country. r
* * * *
Point,” in S.A. Register, rightly credits
Percy M‘Donnell with playing perhaps the best innings
of his life in Adelaide. It was against an English profes-
sional team, and M‘Donnell made 124 and 83 run-out
'* a ma ! lof records. Witness his 239 out
of 363 for N.S. Wales v. Victoria in ’B6, which settled the
match. As already remarked, MTlonnell’s best perform-
a.nce m Eng was for Australia against N. of Eng. at Man-
chester in 83 ; Australia wanted over 100 to win in two
hours on a bad wicket, and Mac made 82 while Bannerman
ma.de 4 and Australia won eventuallv just on time The
English public infinitely prefers batsmen like Lyons,
M Donnell, and Darling to weary plodders such as Giffen,
Donnan, and Alec Bannerman.

(l lraralgon (Vic.) Cricket Club recently held a
i soda!.” at which the Mason medals (given by the
local M.P ) were presented to the top scorers of the
season. The donor, in the course of his speech, offered
some instructive remarks on the subject of medals-“Of
one thing they could rest assured, and that was that so
long as they continued the great kindness of returning
hmi to Parliament so long would he continue to offer the
* nedals fp r competition. Although they were in reality
but small trophies, he felt that they were preferable to a
cup, which was only on exhibition for a short time and
then became, so to speak, nobody’s property. Medals
seemed a fairer way of recognising the merit of the indi-
vidual. They were things that he could keep, or he could
in turn piesent them to his wife or his sweetheart, or his
cousin, or his aunt, if he liked.” He can also, on occasion
present them to his uncle.

Has this yarn been told before? At the local
cricket-matches on the Forest, at Nottingham, they have
a policeman engaged to clear away any enthusiastic
spectators who may be overstepping the boundaries. At
the opening match this season a very young policeman
with a profound ignorance of cricket, was put upon the
job. He went snorting around until he had cleared the
ova! of all non-players bar one roughly-clad interloper
who had taken up a position near the wicket. The ano-ry
policeman finding it impossible to shift this person with
a command, finally seized him from the rear and ran him
off the ground. It was the umpire.

M‘Mullen, last season of the Glebe C.C., has
stepped into the place of probably best all-round player
in the Broken Hill Association, formerly held by bowler
Jones and after his departure by Burnett, P.M. M’Mullen
is batting very freely.

The recent bicycle relay ride, with despatches,
between Sydney and Melbourne has induced a promoter
to devise a still faster mode of conveyance. He proposes
to enclose the missive in a cricket ball, to be thrown
from hand to hand by cricketers stationed about 80vds
apart along the road between the two cities. Not more
than 22 men would be required per mile.
* * * * *
Last year’s fishy action of the “ great ” Melb.
cricket-clubs in seceding from the Association to form a
body of their own and so prevent the weaker organisa-
tions from obtaining any part of the public gate-money,
has been followed (remarks a Bulletin correspondent)
>y eight of the Vic. football clubs, who have formed a new
Association and left the remaining five clubs to shift for
themselves. The most ludicrous part of the latter busi-
ness is that after the five leading clubs on the premiership
hs-t, the ‘ select ” Association is composed of St. Hilda
who come ninth, and Geelong and Carlton, who are
second and third last respectively. North, Ports and
Wilhamstown, who are ahead of the “Saints,” are care-
fully omitted, as is also Footscray, which precedes Carlton
The real point is that beyond the first raters St. Hilda is
included owing to the fact that it contains a “ sassietv ”
element, while Geelong and Carlton, with their past per-
formances, could scarcely be omitted with any degree of
decency. North, Ports, Williatnstown and Footscray
draw, firstly, their players from the moleskin ranks, and,
secondly, have no big bank balances to back them up, and
are consequently not considered “class” enough to asso-
ciate with the footballing Fatman.

Ned Gregory has a youth named Macbeth work-
ing on Sydney Cricket Ground ; said youth is sft. llin.
mgh, well-built, and, in N.G.’s opinion, a paralysing left-
hanfl bowler. “He bowls either fast or medium, keeps a
beautiful length, will pitch a ball on the leg stump which
will whip off the off bail; in junior matches he gets 6
wickets for 3, and 3 wickets for 0, and the other side pulls
up the sticks and goes home ; he should win all the inter-
provincial matches for N.S. W. Tried in private against
Giffen, Gregory, Donnan, Eady, &c., he did splendidly.”
Arthur Coningham, member of ’93 Australian
Eleven runner, hurdle-racer, footballer, billiard-player,
boxer, has now started in business as a hairdresser and
tobacconist at the Glebe, Sydney.

M hat an opportunity this sports meeting gave
for contrasting the physique of cyclists with that of run-
nels or walkers ! What crouching little weeds the noblest
scorchers were alongside the models of strength and
swiftness which breasted the tape at the finish of a mile
or three-mile race! Individually and generally the
cyclists are a terribly weedy lot. y

a bumbling about on English tracks, the
Australian cyclists in England are going from bad to
worse. Payne, it is cabled, has been “suspended for
allegedly taking part m “arranging” a race ; Me-son is
sighing to get home to Sydney ; Lewis has no earthly
hope of doing anything. Yet, the N.S.W. Wheelmen’s
League in its interim report affirms that the three are
worthily upholding the credit of their colony ”

The success of the tote in Maoriland has inspired
an official of the Wellington R.G. to work out some
figures suggesting the advisability of paying divs. on both
first and second horses. At the recent W.R.C. meeting
the proposed system of two payments would have yielded
average divs. of about £6 10s. on the winner, and £6 on
the runner-up, a calculation that makes bookmakers’
odds look more sinfully ridiculous than ever. On behalf
of the scheme it may be pointed out that in England the
system of backing horses “ to win and 1,2,” is popular
with small owners as well as small punters, and there’s no
surface reason why the novelty of backing them for “ first
place and second place only” shouldn’t be even more
popular. As a device for silencing the weak-minded
person who has “ done nothing but back seconds all day
long” this would certainly fill a long-felt want.
* * * •
Kd. Bulletin,- —The M.L. bookmakers are
quite satisfied to lay tote odds, and will not likely go
broke at it, but the jockey clubs object; they say it is
defrauding them of their legitimate revenue, and so they
keep every known metallician off their courses, and if a
“book’’goes on the course he is disqualified for turf
malpractices and sued for trespass, irrespective of
whether he offers to make a bet or not. As a compro-
mise, the bookmakers have offered to refrain from laying
tote odds, and confine themselves strictly to their own
prices, but so far without the effect of their obtaining
admission. Tiib Bulletin seems to have an antipathy to
bookmakers, but it is mild compared to that of a Maori-
land Jockey Club—or - , I suppose, any other racing club
once it is granted the use of the totalisator.— lkey Mo,
Christchurch, M.L.

A Melbourne paper has published a poor little
fable re Mossy Isaacs, in which that amusing old layer of
“ the double ” is represented as saying, “Afore I goes to
the Weedin' course,” &c., &c. This is first-cousin to a
criminal libel on the quite well-spoken Mossy.

Once a week, or oftener, there is a pony race-
meeting at Ascot (Melb.), an unregistered course, where
the sport seems to be rather more genuine, on the whole,
than at, say, Caulfield. Stakes at Ascot seldom exceed
£2O. Last week, there was a Newmarket Handicap, of 50
golden so vs., and a desperate struggle ended in a dead
heat for first place. The betting showed the sincerity of
the 14 jockey's who weighed out, every starter being
backed, and some of them finding friends at the abnor-
mally liberal odds (for Ikey Mo) of 25 to I. The V.R.C.
and V.A.T.C. magnates never mention Ascot—they'have
no official knowledge of its existence, but the “great”
dailies pay it the respect due to a financially prosperous
show, which spends more money in advts. per annum
than all the representative racing clubs put together.

The Victorian public is about to lose its right of
free access to the Flat at Flemington racecourse. The
comment of the Age on the dispute with the V.R.C. used
to be: “The claim made by the V.R.C. to the right to
exclude,” &c. Now it is : “ The claim made by the local
municipalities,” &c. Byron Moore, in a letter to Fleming-
ton Council, “regrets” that the municipalities have not
agreed to a compromise. What would Byron say if, on
catching a pickpocket attempting to filch his purse, the
pickpocket were to offer to take only half the contents if
he were permitted to escape ?

The Melbourne Cup in 1887 was won by a horse
named Dunlop. If a horse of that name ran in the same
race next Nov., probably every cyclist in Australia would
have a bit on.”
* * * *
The running in the Caulfield Stakes and Toorak
Handicap next Saturday may throw light on the Cup
question, which up to now is about as mixed as it has
usually been previous to the opening of the V.A.T.C.
meeting. Most of the likely Cup horses are entered for
one or other of the shorter races, and possibly the Toorak
winner may carry its 141 b. penalty nearly home in the big
handicap, as was the case with Devon two y'ears ago.
Anyway, the form shown by Hopscotch, Bloodshot’
Marusa( if they all go) and W. R. Wilson’s candidate in
the Stakes will be worth watching—better worth watch-
ing than wagering on. Guineas Day at Caulfield is
notorious for surprises.
In the meantime, a dozen or fifteen horses have
good paper chances for the Cup, as far as the present
writer can sort things out. Something without any
apparent chance whatever may do the trick—like Water-
fall last year—but there is no sort of excuse for merely
guessing at a “ turn-up.” The Bulletin will take the
following lot as probabilities, and try to pick one or two
particular fancies from among them—next week. Say
Hopscotch, Bloodshot, Marusa, The Parisienne The
Merry Boy, Merman or another of Mr. Wilson’s, Thunder
Queen, Duhallow and Ayrshire, with a distinct liking for
The Parisienne, Bloodshot, Marusa and Duhallow. How-
ever, this journal will consider the results of the first
Saturday at Caulfield in a calm, unbiassed spirit, and
revolutionise its ideas if necessary.
* * * *
The stories told of Hopscotch when he came to
Melbourne last year are told again now. He was then a
marvel,” “the fastest horse in Australia,” &c., until
the cracks met him and found out his weak spot. Hop-
scotch last Nov. cut a moderate figure when tackled at the
business end of the V.R.C. Flying Stakes by Hova and
WaUace Previously he had been beaten in the Melb.
Cup, Melb. Stakes, and Caulfield Cup after vanquishing l
fields of second-class horses in Sydney. He may be a
better stayer this season than he was twelve months ago
but, in the opinion of the erring mortal who writes these
*"P BC pt<;h has only a moderate chance of winninG*
the Caulfield Cup, and a much smaller show in the Mel-
bourne. A Sydney jockey, whose judgement is superior
to most peoples , recommends Fort for the C.C. in nre-
ference to anything else. e

Should one of W. R. Wilson’s be warmly backed
to win the Guineas on Saturday the public will have a
good enough tip to go upon ; also in any other event the
colors should be worth following. There is encourage-
ment in the recent performances of Resolute and Mer-
man. The three-year-old had some difficulty in beatino-
Bloodshot the other day, but the real quality of Blood"
shot, who ranked as a non-stayer in Maoriland will
reveal itself presently, luck permitting.

behind the best Australian form is absurd.

to 4.57*. Both Fritz and Prince Harold are N.S.W. bred.

A drag containing about 20 dreadful young
men, adorned with flags, ribbons, and a flaring
ment that Collingwood had won the football premiersh p
for 1896, was driven around Melbourne last Sunday, ine
20 unlovely occupants of the vehicle were understood to
be the heroes of the hour, swollen with glory and beer.
* * *
Saturday’s convincing match for the Vic. foot-
ball premiership was responsible for the season s large
crowd and very even play. Collingwood s i goals to 2 in
the first quarter mainly won them the premiership, :
South had the best of the game from then to the hnisn.
The final result, Collingwood 6er. 9b. to S. Melb. og. lob.,
is a fair criterion of the evenness of the match.
Linton, the great English crack, is understood
to have succumbed, in great measure, to high-gear. e
rode in the Bordeaux-to-Paris race with a gear of over
90in. Authorities say such high gears strain the heart and
make heavy calls upon both the nervous and muscular
system. Linton, who among other feats put up 31 muss
in an hour, was a wonderful athlete, and his demise will not
raise the hygienic reputation of the wheel. Martin, who
rides a 96-gear, has said to many friends : “ Some day 1
shut right up.” Another rider whom high-gear will
crack some day is Pither, the ex-Maorilander.

The action for damages, Hunter and Wynne v.
N.S.W. Wheelmen’s League v. Sydney City Council,
arising from H. and W.’s tandem skidding on a watered
street and tipping* its riders under a four-horse bus, will
prove of great interest to the league and cyclists gener-
ally. The case will, of course, turn on the question
whether the City people over-watered the street, and
whether such over-watering caused the trouble; for
cyclists can’t logically deny the Council’s right to lay the
dust in the interests of the majority, even at the risk of
breaking wheelmen’s necks.


WONDERFUL
Blood-Purifying Effect
OF
Ayer's Sarsaparilla
Mr. Charles Stephenson, a well-known
Railway Employe at Kalapoi, New
Zealand, writes:
“About ten years ago, while en-
gaged in shunting, my foot caught
between the rails, and my leg was
fractured below the knee. It healed
in time, but I have been troubled
ever since with swollen veins, and
have been obliged, at times, to wear
a bandage. About a year ago it be-
came much worse, and I feared I
should be obliged to give up my
work. A friend advised me to try
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. I did so, and
after taking four bottles the sAvell-
ing disappeared, and I have not
been troubled with it since.”

then Gov. Brassey is “ too much.”
The champion suicide of the month is a
Maoriland man who chopped his hand off with an
axe, and then sat round till he bled to death.
The body of a mining expert (named Robins) was found
in the Yarra the other day. There was no evidence as to
how he got there, but The Bulletin can guess at it.
Perhaps the time is coming when an assem-
bly of hungry shepherds will pass a resolution in
favor of a thumping big land and absentee-
tax. At a recent meeting in Melbourne, Rev. ;
P. Robertson bemoaned the fact that more than !
half the soil of Bananaland had fallen into the
hands of absentee landlords and financial institu-
tions, neither of whom do anything to aid Presby-
terian churches in the neighborhood of their pro-
perties. We may live to see a graduated land-tax
among the articles of Kerristian faith in Aus-
tralia.

Dear Bulletin, —A casual specimen of
W.A. railway-management. I had occasion a few
days ago to wait at Coolgardie for the arrival of
the express—with my wife aboard. It was due at
3 p.m., but did not come until 10 next morning.
When about 15 hours behind time, the Coolgardie
officials woke up to the fact that the express was
late—somebody must have told them. The guard
of an up-train then signified his intention of wait-
ing no longer. The official in charge declined to
interfere, and left the responsibility entirely to the
guard, who thereupon started his train “on his
own.” As there is only a single line of rails which
the express must be on somewhere, I committed
my wife to the mercy of Providence and hoped for
the best. As it happened, the two trains met
when going slowly, and the up-train had to push
back to Coolgardie. No one was killed, and the
officials seemed somewhat soured over the result.
They are a happy-go-lucky crowd, and even the
fact that two trains were rushing at each other on
a single line of rails, and no one seemed really to
know where the express was or where the smash
might come off, didn’t disturb them much, appar-
ently.—C.L.

Beside the Yarra stream he strolled,
■Reflecting over “ fine reports ”
Which testified to grains of gold
In foolish little streaks of quartz ;
He thought, perchance, of assays made
From samples rich in mining guile,
Of cronk promoters who had preyed
Upon the public for a while;
Perhaps he felt a deep remorse
r For having aided with his pen
To smooth the dark, unholy course
i Of many, many wild-cat men.
Tiie river flowing gently by
Could wash away all sense of sin ;
He wiped the tear-drop from his eye,
And boldly took a header in.
There passed before his expert eyes
The prospect of a Golden Shore,
Where Truth is told instead of lies
Triumphantly for evermore;
He held his arms above his head,
Content to clutch at church belief,
And long before they found him dead
His soul had struck Salvation Reef.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 18711 was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline "V itality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,

He had a bad name, but he had earned it,
nor, after striving after it bo hard and so long, did
he seem anxious to lose it. It was now his sole
possession save a father and some debts, if such
can be styled possessions. His father had summed
him up to the dispenser of embrocation and snake-
essence as a“d d bad egg.” “Yes,” said
boniface, ruefully, “he owes me twenty-five bob
for some time. ” ‘ ‘ Sorry for you,” said the parental
possession, “ for he’ll never pay.” That evening
the Wreck was earnestly expostulating with Mr.
Bung ; he begged hard for a drink, cried, promised
eternal reformation, but no —boniface was firm,
and finally, putting his foot down hard, said :
“No, not if yer rots for it —not another drop.
Yer’ve ’ad me for twenty-five bobs’ worth already,
and yer own father says it’s as good as gone.” A
dazed and puzzled look came into the Wreck’s
face. Sorrowfully said he —“What! my father
said that?” “Yes.” “My father said that —
well, maybe I’m not much chop, but damme if I’ll
make the old man a liar.’’
Duck eggs are the most nourishing and
meatiest of foods, and, in the case of invalids who
don’t altogether like their somewhat strong flavor,
they can be easily taken, and will digest easily if
accompanied with a small bloater paste sandwich
or some similar appetiser.

somewhere on the Barcoo, but cannot recollect

A municipal council election at Fitzroy
(Melb), the other day, was fought to a desperate
finish by a dentist and an undertaker. Both can-
didates were ardent supporters of an improved
drainage policy, but the undertaker’s interests
being clearly opposed to a decrease in the death-
rate, Fitzroy decided in favor of the dentist by
one vote. He, at any rate, was bound to want his
constituents to outlive their last tooth.

THE INFLUENZA SCOURGE.
NEWS AND HINTS.
HOW TO FACE THE EPIDEMIC.
The Epidemic of Influenza is not yet at an end ;
and the after effects of this terrible disease are
still felt by numerous sufferers. Indeed, severe as
Influenza is in its attack, the after-symptoms are
perhaps even more insiduously dangerous, and it
behoves all who have suffered from the dreaded
epidemic to safeguard themselves against its later
consequences.
The Scarborough Mercury describes .—. event
of local interest, which bears out this opinion. A
reporter of the great newspaper named interviewed
a Mr. Thomas Harland, of 10 Arncliffe Terrace,
Grlaisdale, Yorkshire, who had been rendered in-
capable of work by Influenza during a previous
epidemic. Mr. Harland said, in reply to questions,
“My illness began a year ago last Christmas with
a severe attack of influenza. Afterwards I began
rapidly to get weaker. I could not sleep at nights,
my appetite failed, and although I did not take
my bed yet I could scarcely support my own weight.
I tried all sorts of ‘ doctoring. ’ I was a month in
the Scarborough Sea Bathing Infirmary ; then I
went to Harrogate, and the doctor told me that I
was suffering from anaemia, or bloodlessness in
consequence of the influenza, which affects the
nerves, and causes great general weakness. I re-
turned home still very weak, and utterly unable
to be of any use. Just at this time, however, my
son saw an account in one of the papers of a
woman who had suffered from influenza like my-
self, and who told a reporter what marvellous
effect Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People
had upon her. I determined to try them. I could
not tell that I had received any relief from the
first box, although I was told I was looking better;
but before I had taken a second box I found my-
self rapidly improving. I was able to sleep better,
my nerves were stronger, and my appetite much
better. Now, after my fifth box, lam quite
strong again, and I strongly recommend them to
all who suffer.”
In all cases of Influenza and after-effects, Dr.
William’s Pink Pills have a miraculous efficacy.
They are recognised as one of the greatest modern
medicines, a perfect blood builder and nerve re-
storer, and an unfailing cure for rheumatism,
sciatica, neuralgia, partial paralysis, locomotor
ataxy, St. Vitus’ dance, nervous headache, pros-
tration, &c. They restore pale and sallow com-
plexions to the glow of health, and are a specific
for. all the troubles peculiar to the female sex,
while in the case of men they effect a radical cure
in all cases arising from mental worry, overwork,
or excess.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are obtainable from all
leading chemists, or from the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Coy., Queen’s Place, Sydney, who will for-
ward (post paid), on receipt of stamps or post order,
1 box for 2s. 9d. or \ dozen for 14s. 9d.*

The Old Reliable.
Disease Is an effect, not a cause. Its origin
Is within; its manifestations without. Hence,
to cure the disease the cause must be removed,
and in no other way can a cure ever be ef-
fected. Warner’s Safe Cure is established on
Just this principle. It realises that
95 PER CENT.
of all diseases arise from deranged Kidneys
and Liver, and it strikes at once at the root
of the difficulty. The elements of which it is
composed act directly upon these great organs,
both as a food and restorer, and. by placing
them in a healthy condition, drive disease and
£ain from the system.
. For the innumerable troubles caused by
unhealthy Kidneys, Liver and Urinary Organs:
for the distressing Disorders of Vv’omen: for
all Nervous Affections, and physical derange-
ments generally, this great remedy has no
equal. Its past record is a guarantee pf
continued performance.

“ Ball-ingtori Booth —of course he must
revert to the Three Balls.”
“ The Billy ” writes :
Dear Hi'UjKtin, —Re your notice of Kingston’s proposed
amendments in S.A. Legal Practitioners Act. Doesn tit
strike you as inconsistent that a lawyer should he made
responsible for negligence in his business, and yet be
allowed to practise after serving only two-years articles ?
Such a law would make a man responsible for ignorance
of what he had not had time to learn, lie w uld not be
allowed to plead want of knowledge in answ , to such a
charge. In fact, the rule would probably increase ex-
pense, for he- wotild have to go for advice to an older
solicitor. Another point: supposing (as is and no doubt
will continue to be the case) that a man is not allowed to
begin practice till he is 21 years old, it would be useless
for him to enter articles till he is 19. What is he to do
between 16 and 19? Loaf? Certainly, experience in a
merchant’s office would be useful if he can get a billet.
But can he? And if he passes out before he is 21, what
will he do? Again, loaf? Apropos, in the Tas. new L.P.
Bill it is proposed not to allow a solicitor to take articled
clerks until he has passed three years. This comes rough
on those who can buy into big firms ; but they are too
few- to be considered, and the wisdom of the proposed
rule is obvious. Your objection, no doubt, would be that
it puts a premium ori the power to pay big article-money.
Why not settle that by law- ? Anyway, how- can a man
hope to succeed if he’s articled to a firm without practice ?
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to

ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
Dear Bulletin, —One of the best bush-
fights I. ever heard of was at the once glorious min-
ing town of Brewinga. Billy Bloomer, in Richard-
son’s pub., called for a bucket of beer, and planked
down a sovereign on the counter. Bill had an
irresistible manner, so the landlord pocketed the
sovereign and handed a bucketful of beer over the
counter. Bill stood over it with his legs : apart,
pulled his dusty hat off and dashed it to the floor,
intimating that the first man who touched it
would, in the very near future, be called to account
for all the sins of his life. “No fool game ter
touch the ’at ? Then yer all curs ! so take that,
and that, and that! ” And Bill dipped the beer
out and slushed it into the faces of the crowd
with terrible earnestness and speed. Of course
they mobbed and downed him before it became
necessary to call for tenders for the building of a
second ark. Then with him on his back on the
floor and a man posted on each of his arms
and legs, they fairly deluged his face and
body with beer. “Look ’ere,” spluttered Bill,
it ain’t'fair t’ ’ave twenty onter one. But if yer
wants a mill, I’ll take any man in Brewinga.”
“ Oo’s the cove wants ter fight ? ” cried somebody
from the bench outside the pub. “ I’ll ’ave ado
at ’ini. I ain’t ’ad no decent exercise fer a week,
so trot ’im out! ” So they repaired to the nearest
paddock. It was very dark on this particular
night; and every time a fight was held in the
dark it was a recognised Brewinga rule that
the recipient of a blow should say “ Home !’,
and then state whether it was a heavy,
medium, or light blow. This was con-
sidered the best means of posting the crowd
up in the progress of affairs. This time the men
hadn’t started two minutes when Bill cried,
“ ’Ome ! Jaw ! Light ! ” Soon after the other
pugilist said, “ ’Ome ! Nob ! Ton ’o bricks ! ”
Then Bill called the next twice, “’Ome ! Blinker !
Goodun ! ” and “ ’Ome ! Ribs ! Knocked me onter
my back!” Then the other, “’Ome! Pinny!
Waster!” And Bill, “ ’Ome! Other blinker!
Beauty ! By gosh ! I reckon I’ve felt that paw
afore ternight. Give’s a match.” Somebody lit a
match, which Bill took and held near the face of
his opponent, and suddenly exclaimed, “ S’elp
ine. Why it’s Brummy Nolan ! I thought I’d
felt them pokes afore. Yer ’and, Brummy. Let’s
’ave a drink afore we finishes the business. Come
on, you fools, let’s all ’ave a drink. And we did.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Looking toward his home, Moore caught a
glimpse of light through the trees. It came from
his wife’s bedroom, most likely ? He wondered
vaguely what would be her greeting. She had
expected him to return in five weeks; it was
exactly five hours since she had waved good-bye to
him from the wharf. He pondered without in-
terest the question what she would have thought,
and said, and done, had the steamer been moving
just a little faster and sent them all to eternity.
He had expected to find the house in darkness.
Yet where was the need to alter his pace? What
did he gain by getting home a minute sooner—say,
before his wife put out tier light ? He would have
to depict the scene of the collision for her; and
he was in the wrong mood for that. She would
be full of wifely interest, womanly sympathy, about
his share. Could a woman never escape from her
sex ? Exalted to a position of mock heroism by
his wife ! In contemplation of the part marked
for him he felt that he could weep—tears of petu-
The thought recurred —had it all ended other-
wise, and his wife been a widow ? A loss or gain
to her? Neither, in any great degree, he could
answer. She would marry again; he could look
calmly at that, with even a smile at his inability
to give distinct features to the figure his fancy
conjured up as his successor. There was the boy
—a different matter; but as he had his father’s
blood in him, he could almost be left uncon-
sidered ; he would shape his own course.
His wife was eight years younger—barely 30 ;
bright, clever, good-looking. One who met life
gaily, who, with a nature as deep as anyone’s, yet
immersed herself in superficialities. An anomaly ;
the centre of it hidden from him. Their natures
were widely divergent: they had daily inter-
course, yet trod separate paths.
Was that to be regretted ? No ; or at least in a
very limited number of aspects. Their married
life fell midway between happiness and discontent,
touching neither. Life to him was mostly on that
plane.
Perhaps the one thing he regretted—if anything
in life was serious enough to demand regret —was
the fact of his marrying at all. That had been a
mistake ; one among many ; all the natural issue
of the mistake of having been born. A world of
error ! How could it be otherwise, when the right
thing lay undecipherable amid a multitude of
wrong ?
Looking up at the house, he noted that it was
the drawing-room that was lighted—a thing that
called for surprise; but he was reluctant to confess
to any. The drawing-room was seldom used at
night, the dining-room downstairs being occupied
as a sitting-room. Only when society visitors
came in the evening—an unusual event —was it
necessary to go upstairs.
He went to the back of the house and found it
dark. The servants must have gone to bed, but
that was unlikely in the fact of visitors being pre-
sent. They had been given a night off, and were
not returned? But that seemed unlikely, since
the house was shut. He tried one door—to find
it locked. Was it that his wife was alone, and
feeling timid had locked up the house before the
servants came in ? Then there vvere no visitors,
and she was sitting by herself in the drawing-
room —a change from her ordinary habit, induced
by her loneliness. She had probably been at the
piano. On this theory the seeming contradictions
were congruous and intelligible.
He was about to ascend the back stairs when he
remembered that the key of one door had been
lost a few days before. He turned the handle and
entered; darkness enveloped him. He walked
carefully, so as not to startle his wife by any
noise. He was fortunate enough to find a clear
passage, and reaching the foot of the stairs safely
he began to ascend, keeping a hand on the
banister.
The silence of the house seemed an ominous
thing; Moore caught himself stopping to listen to
it. At the turning he halted; his heart was
beating strangely fast, his blood alert, as if expect-
ant of something. He was visited by an out-
rageous thought. “ Was he in the wrong house ? ”
He was about to consider the question, to sum up
remembrance, when he heard a voice—pitched,
sustained, with a musical clearness in the sound —
a man’s voice. He was struck aghast —the thing
was so contrary to anything the circumstances
made possible. He was awake, and in his own
home. His mind ran back, but he found no rest
for his thought ; no haziness in his remembrance.
A gleam of light shot across the events of the day,
revealing them to him in one immediate glance —
distinct and in order, carrying him to his presence
there.
He had ascended to the top of the stairs, and
his hand now encountered an overcoat. The
touch of it sent a shock through him that reduced
him to material facts of life. He took up the hat
that was on the stair-post and, handling it, wa g
vaguely glad that he could not name the owner.
Neither did the voice help him to a guess, though
he heard it more distinctly now—the voice of a
man reading aloud.
Why was his first conscious instinct a desire to
escape—to descend the stairs and go out into the
street till he could consider what to do ? Surely
small consideration was necessary ; his imperative
duty lay before him, not behind. Was it that he
felt some charity towards his wife? Was it for
her sake that he did not wish to come upon them ?
Or was it wholly a fear to take up his own part in
the discovery ; a fear that had masked itself in
subtle disguise?
He had leaned back against the wall, but now
stood up : he was in no need of support. But he
could not calm his heart; his blood tingled through
his veins, giving him an odd sense of a new value
in life—a value that deficient human senses could
not quite lay hold of. Existence seemed to pro-
mise something. A clear happiness when his pre-
sent task was accomplished ? He asked himself
the question.
Looking up the corridor, he saw the ray of light
that came through the drawing-room door. What
was the scene that the door hid from him ? And
what was the basis of the sudden, bitter prayer
that it should close fast now, and, opening to no
one’s effort, bury those two within walls ? It was
the awakening of the husband in him. He knew
it, and felt it in a weakening of his blood. He
was no longer his old self, but one among a hun-
dred ; acting a part that had so often been acted
before —the meanest part that could be given to a
high-minded man. In angry denial of such con-
ception of himself —in attempt to shut it out, he
went up the passage.
The length seemed interminable, the noise of his
walking was deafening, and the walls seemed to
close in upon him as he passed. Even at the
threshold of the door he had a prompting that it
was not too late to turn back ; one of the hated
promptings that were not any part of himself.
He compressed his lips and entered ; a flood of
warm light seemed to close around him. The
fancy gave him strength; he became calmer; it was
as if he had been spiritually welcomed.
In one glimpse he saw the pair ; the noise of his
footsteps had alarmed them ; they stood separate,
the first instinctive movement of each had been
towards an individual defence. The identity of
the man gave him no surprise ; he was not able to
be surprised, more intense feelings finding place
with him.
It was Leston, the accountant in the branch in-
surance-office which Moore managed. He remem-
bered, even at this turbulent moment, that he had
once remarked to his wife that Leston was dis-
tinctly a good-looking man ; a judgment that she
had not wholly acceded to. Was this idle word
the germinal cause of his present dishonor? The
thing was almost worth enquiry. He could not
recall that there had been much intimacy between
his wife and Leston. But then the husband is ever
the last to see what is happening at his side.
She was dressed in a pale-blue tea-gown, a rib-
bon at her throat. He could think that this even-
ing she must have looked remarkably well, but
now the deadly pallor and set cast of her features
showed only a mind in t. ~vail. She was standing
behind a chair, her hands clasping the back of it.
She was small in stature, but carried herself
well; her eyes gave a depth, her lips wero finely
cut, her face in every pose showed the strength of
fearlessness. Young, with good features and an
abundance of dark brown hair, she was a woman
who could always look stylish.
“ You ! ” she said quiveringly, almost as he en-
tered. It seemed as if the word broke from her,
before she had made an effort to speak.
He crossed over to the mantelpiece, and, resting
one arm there, stood facing her. He could see
that Leston was shifting his gaze from one to the
other, unknowing what to do, or what was to be
done. The feverish excitement of his wife stirred
an echo in him ; he endeavored to steady his voice.
“ I have disturbed you,” he said.
“It seems like it.” The laughter rang out;
recklessness, nervousness, echoing in the notes of
it.
She knew now that he had long suspected her ;
that his departure had been but a trick. He had
come back to discover the thing he looked for.
Let him make what he could of it ! She could
laugh again at the part that was his. In her
feminine mind, the pitiful meanness of his manner
of unmasking her—not to include the full success
of it—made him appear most contemptible. For
the moment, her sin was, in some retrospective
way, justified by it. As concerning herself, how
could she be less than glad that her life was re-
duced to fact; that she had no longer to deceive ?
And how much easier it was to acknowledge guilt
than it would have been to deny !
Moore kept his eyes off Leston, his intention
being to ignore him to the utmost. It would be a
sacrifice of dignity to take open notice of him;
and his wife would feel a keener shame in his
looking to her as the only guilty one.
He addressed himself to her with gay pretence.
“ A friend of yours ? ”
Could any man but he be so infamous as to
amuse himself with her shame ? Had he not mind
enough to know that the shame was partly his ?

She would force him to feel it. “ You can call
him what you like.”
“ A lover, then ? ’
She had courted the word, yet her woman’s
nature felt a stab. “ Lover! ” It seemed to cry
itself in the street, to be caught on the wind, and
carried echoing in the ears of the outer world.
But she had compelled him to explicitly attack
her; she had the victory she had attempted.
“ You have defined him—and yourself,” she said.
“ And also you.”
Strange that she had not foreseen to what she
would lay herself open. Was it that her mind
was not capable of calm thought? Must she
at ipowledge that she was not able to cope with
him ? She saw her woman’s heart as the founda-
tion of defeat. Was his strength more than of
manhood—an individual element in him ? She felt
suddenly that he could do as he willed with her ;
that lie could make her kneel to him; make her
pitifully repentant.
In protest of finding herself at that depth, she
looked at the man for whom she had sacrificed
herself. But there was no help for her there ; he
was younger, more hesitating than herself. In a
flash she realised that she was more to blame than
he ; that she had not less misshaped his life, than
her own. Shiveringly she felt her isolation ; a
guilty woman at the mercy of the world.
Moore watched her unflinchingly. He was sur-
prised at the ease with which he had taken com-
mand of the situation ; how calmly he held it. A
few moments before he had not known what to do,
but now he could think calmly, see clearly. Vic-
tory was his, even a kind of victory over Fate,
who had prepared a situation in which he was to
have been made to play a ridiculously pitiful part.
He felt no pang in knowing he was a dishonored
husband, and endeavored to persuade himself that
there was no reason why he should feel one. But
he was wise enough to know that his strength lay
in contempt of the pair before him, in making
them realise themselves contemptible.
“What is the book?” he said, gazing at a
volume that lay open on the floor where it had
been dropped.
“ Does that interest you ? ” she said angrily.
“ Naturally. It has interested you.”
“ Oh, enviable woman ! ” She laughed scorn-
fully—at herself and him.
“ You seem to regret something.”
“My marriage?” she suggested.
“ My God, woman, not half as much as I do —as
1 have done from the first.”
He moved his arm and accidentally upset a vase ;
it fell on the floor, breaking into fragments. The
noise went echoing through the house. To the
woman’s excited fancy it was a signal of something
that was to happen ; she looked to the door ex-
pecting to see a terrifying shape take entrance.
She listened, and afar off she thought she heard
the faint tolling of a bell. Her heart stopped,
then bea f to the tolling. She felt chilled to the
blood.
Leston coughed to clear his voice, but found
nothing to say. He was young, and felt the situ-
ation out of his reach. He could see in every
movement that they had advantages over him,
and these he could ascribe to the confidence en-
gendered by their years.
He had, to himself, imagined discovery often
enough, but not in this shape. He had not con-
ceived a husband calmly accepting the situation.
But, after all, since he could not take up a heroic
attitude, he could congratulate himself on being
almost wholly ignored. He would most probably
escape scathless—a sufficient achievement, had it
been by any effort of his own. Yet he was dully
aware that his position had yet to be defined, that
he must take the part that was put upon him.
Moore considered the import of the silence, then
permitted himself to add, at a measured pace—
“We both made a mistake. And the issue—we
have here. Well, even of that I can bear my
part. But your part—l honestly pity.”
She seemed heedless of all around ; her eyes on
the doorway expectantly. “I can do without
it,” she said pettishly.
“ I am aware of that, and I can easily under-
stand it. You get rid of me, and you take in my
place—this.” He turned to Leston, and the man
shrank back ashamed. “A pretty boy, young
enough to be educated to appreciate you. ”
“ Oh, stop ! stop ! ” she cried.
A child, barefooted and clad in a flannel night-
gown, stood hesitant at the door. He was about
seven years old, and in features a likeness of his
father. The mother saw him, and called him to
her with a look.
Moore followed her gaze, and knew then that it
was not the sting of his words that had moved her,
but only the fear of the child understanding.
“Frank !” he said sharply to the boy, “come
here ! ”
Disobedience of that voice was impossible; he
came like a dog.
“ Close the door—and take that chair.”
The boy did his bidding, and then sat looking
at his mother; his childish astonishment addressed
to her.
The woman stood up with locked hands—
supplicating, speechless.
“ You are not forbidden to look upon him,” said
Moore, coldly, in answer.
“Send him away,” she whispered, quiveringly.
“No. His proper place is here.”
She flung herself on the chair, in a passion of
weeping, her soul given up to despair.
“Father, —— ” began the boy.
“Sit there, sir ! Don’t move till I tell you ! ”he
was answered.
Leston crossed over and stood beside the woman;
an opening was offered him. “For the child’s
sake, if not for hers, send him away.”
Moore laughed in contemptuous derision.
“ Surely you are imposing on your position ! ”
“ I do not know about that, but you are cruelly
imposing upon yours.”
“ If you dare to question me, by the living God
I’ll throw you over that balcony.” His violent
utterance rang true, and the echo of it, adding
further excitement to his blood, made him danger-
ously fit for what he threatened to do.
“Don’t speak to him,” said Mrs. Moore,
alarmedly. “You do not know how passionate
And you can do no good. ”
Leston, warm in offence, hated to now acknow-
ledge to a physical fear. But for her sake he must
submit; and because he was so checked and ham-
Eered he began to look forward to escape. Yet
onor compelled him to stay with the woman ;
compelled him—did it not?—to making her his
wife if need were.
“ How long is this going to continue ? ” he said
at length. “ What are you going to do ? ”
“ There is nothing more for me to do ; the rest
falls on you to do.” The man’s whole thought ran
to dramatic utterance. Yet he had an educated
disdain of the stage.
‘ * What am I to do ? ”
“Leave this house at once—taking her with
you. ” Moore was only outwardly calm ; his heart
beat in frightened prospect of the departure of his
wife from out of his life. He was so used to her :
what would it mean ?
His strength had departed, and he knew that
he was physically ill. He feared that he could
not maintain his part to the end. He wished they
would hurry—a mad desire to escape from the room
had seized him.
“Come, Lucy,” said Leston, bending over her.
He wondered that he should so quietly accept the
burden of her, though he knew there was nothing
else that he could do.
Her sobs had ceased ; she sat with her face
hidden, giving no sign that she heard.
“ Lucy ! ” It was an appeal to her to look up,
so that he may read the reason of her unwilling-
ness.
She jumped up quickly, and, throwing herself
out of his embracing arms, staggered against a
small desk that stood by the wall, and halted with
her back to it.
“No, I will not go,” she cried. “Not though
he orders it. I stay here —my place is here. I
could not go with you. How could you think of
it ?It would mean ” She turned quickly to
her husband. “Can I stay,? Only till to-morrow.
See, I ask it; on my knees, if I must.”
“You can do as you will,” he said, simply. “ I
will offer no objection now.”
She turned to Leston, speaking from a centre
that was hidden from him. “ You can go.”
“ But you!”
“Go ! ” she commanded.
He made his pitiful departure. Moore felt an
infinite relief ; he sat down wearily in a chair, his
face turned from her.
She saw the depth of his despair, and her heart
moved madly—responsive to her thoughts. Her
fault rose up behind her, threatening to advance
and overwhelm her —a purpose beckoned her to
escape.
V Will you put Frank to bed ? ” She spoke
quietly ; a new strength had been given her.
He looked up in surprise. The fact of hav-
ing to be. told by her what he must do was a
shock to him. He saw how far beneath command
of himself he had sunk, but he made no effort to
recover.
“Yes,” he said.
The child followed him, nervous, crying piti-
fully, and was the more abandoned in his tears
that he knew not very definitely why he should
cry.
In quieting him, Moore promised that his mother
would not leave him ; that she would not be per-
mitted. He attempted to persuade himself that
though he had lost a wife, he had no right to
deprive the child of a mother. He felt happier in
such thought, though he knew he was but juggling
with his mind.
The soft promises he had to make to the boy
helped to soothe himself as well. But he saw no
course of action, nor what in honor he could offer
her.
He went back to the drawing-room, possessed
of a full indifference. He himself was under no
necessities. Fate could do with him as it would.
Or his wife could decide what was to be ; he would
stand aside, offering no opposition to either.
“You have come back,” she said. “ I hoped
you would.” He acquiesced dully and stood by
the doorway. He had a horror of taking up his
old position by the mantelpiece. The woman read
a hatred of coming near to her.
He had leisure to notice her; to see that her
face paled and flushed, that her eyes were lumin-
ously bright. She stood as when he had left her,
yet her attitude seemed constrained.
He had to break through a silence. “ What is it
you want with me? ”
“ Nothing. U nless
“ Well ? ”
“To hear your reproaches.’
“Lucy ! ” He reproached her levity.
She laughed defiantly, but her laughter rang
hollow. “Tell me how much you despise me,” she
said. “ How much you hate me ! Do ! ”
“ How much I pity you ; how much I pity us
both ! ”
“ Oh, Harry. Not that,” shesaid with a shiver.
“Do not conquer me ! Be harsh ! Treat me as I
deserve ! Why don’t you hate me ? ”
“ Say because Frank doesn’t. He will not let
his mother leave him ; I had to promise that she
would not. ”
She looked long in silence ; as if she could not
credit him. Her breath came in short gasps. Not
till he again glanced up at her did she find utter-
ance. “ The poor child—the darling! And J—
my pride in him should have saved me. I wonder
why it did not. I have been mad this last month
—not myself. Oh, the horror of it now ! ”
“ Will you stay ?”
“You had to promise him, you say. That was
cruelly hard on you.”
“ I have not said that. Will you stay ? ”
He was aware that he was offering her all
that was in his heart; and more than was
in his mind. He knew not where he stood.
His head swam; the walls of the room seemed
to recede, then halt and come slowly back.
He looked up—to see his wife fall forward on her
face.
He ran to her, and knelt beside her, his mind
in the travail of unshaped fears. He lifted her in
his arms and turned her face towards him.
“ Lucy, what is it? You are ill! You have
hurt yourself ! ” A convulsion seized her, and left
her with her features set in distortion.
“You would take me back? ” she whispered.
“For his sake.”
“Ah, yes,” she sighed. She held a pause, then
asked—“ Not for my own ? ”
His face hardened; she asked more than he
could give her.
“Let me go,” she cried. “Do not hold me!
How can you when you hate me so ? ” Her violence
carried her out of his arms, and she stopped at a
distance from him.
“I do not hate you, Lucy. You know I don’t.
But I cannot pretend that I have forgiven you.”
“I did not ask for that; I only meant—but it
doesn’t matter. It is best that it should end now.”
“ End, Lucy ? ”
“ Can’t you see ? ” she cried fiercely.
He caught an inspiration from her tone ; an in-
finite horror surged through him. “ Lucy ! have
you poisoned yourself ? ” He made a step towards
her.
“ Don’t come near me ! ” she screamed, raising
herself on her hands. “ I will not let you touch
me ! ”
“ Lucy ! ” Horror held him in its embrace; he
was capable only of a weak utterance of her name.
“Listen!’’ she cried excitedly. “Frank is
calling me. You hear him ? Let me go to him ? ”
She looked up for permission, as he stood sense-
lessly watching her.
“Do not follow me,” she said. “Let me go
alone. I must see him before ”
She staggered to her feet, and, reaching the
doorway, steadied herself there and went down
the passage.
The child was crying upon the bed ; her screams
had alarmed him. She hurried, and coming heavily
against the wall staggered back from it—fell, with
outstretched hands—quivered, and lay motionless.
Moore, looking vacantly down at her, wondered
dully why the child was sobbing.

“ Allow me, on behalf of Mrs. Holt, to thank you very sincerely for your
kind thought in sending her, on Saturday, a bottle of your famed Irish Moss. I may say that
it is an old and valued friend of ours, and I am sure our esteem of its virtues will be

“ With all sincere wishes for your success and well-being,
