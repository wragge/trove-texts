THE CAN DIAN MODEL
APTIA to Copyright and other matters,
in Sept. Monthly Review J. S.
Ewart states some features of the
Canadian attitude to Britain, thus:
CHi lda favours preferential tariffs within tlie
Eiu.a.o; but at the same time she intends to
maintain her protective tariff as against every-
body. In other words, Canada will remain
protective (even against other parts of the Empire)
with reference to all articles which she can
produce ; but as to those which she must import,
she will give preference to products of the
Empire....
There is a Canadian side which must not be
omitted from view, and that view, I have no
hesitation in s vying, is that the powers of self-
government wn a we possess we shall hold ; that
while we are absolutely loyal to our King we owe
no fealty or subjection whatever to Westminster
or to Downing-street; that we have our own fiscal
ideas, and we do not intend to submit them for
revision to electors who, as many of our people
think, are unable rightly to settle their own
tariff—who are the despair of Mr. Chamberlain
himself ; tli it we have our own notions as to our
own development, and are not inclined to brook
criticism o. them from those millions who know
little of the conditions and aspirations of a young,
vigorous community of gigantic proportions and
illimitable possibilities ; that we are a democratic,
peace-loving community, and that we are ill-suited
for political union with a nation whose charac-
teristics are much more decidedly aristocratic,
hierarchical, and militarist than ours, and whose
predominance in federal councils would make us
mere endorsers of a policy that we do not approve.
J *
At the Imperial Conference of 1902 Canada’s
reply to the request for contributions to the Navy
was as follows :
The Canadian Ministers regret that they have been
unable to assent to the suggestions made- by Lord
Selborne respecting the Navy and Mr. St. John Brodrick
respecting the Army. The Ministers desire to point put
that their objections arise, not so much from the expense
involved, as from a belief that the acceptance of the
proposals would entail an important departure from the
principle of colonial self-government. Canada values
highly the measure of local independence which has
been granted to it from time to time by the Imperial
authorities, and which has been so productive of beneficial
results, both as respects the material progress of the
country and the strengthening of the ties that bind it to
the Mother Land. But while, for these reasons, the
Canadian Ministers are obliged to withhold their assent to
the propositions of the Admiralty and the War Office,
they fufly appreciate the duty of the outlay for those
necessary preparations of self-defence which every coun-
try has to assume and bear.
That the taxpayers of the United kingdom should desire
to be relieved of some of the burdens which they bear in
connection with military expenditure is quite reasonable.
Canada in the development of its own militia will be found
ready to respond to that desire by taking upon itself some
of the services in the Dominion which have hitherto been
borne by the Imperial Government. What has already
been done by Canada must give assurance of the disposi-
tion of the Canadian people to recognise their proper
obligations.
At present Canadian expenditures for defence services
are confined to the military side. The Canadian Govern-
ment are prepared to consider the naval side of.defence
as well. On the sea-coasts of Canada there is a large num-
ber of men admirably qualified to form a Naval Reserve,
and it is hoped that at an early day a system may be
devised which will lead to the training of these men, and
to the making of their services available for defence in
time of need.
In conclusion, the Ministers repeat that, while the
Canadian Government are obliged to dissent from the
measures proposed, they fully appreciate the obligation
of the Dominion to make expenditures for the purposes
of defence in proportion to the increasing population and
wealth of the country. They are willing that these ex-
penditures shall be so directed as to relieve the taxpayer
of the Mother Country from some of the burdens which
she now bears; and thej' have the strongest desire to
carry out their defence schemes in co-operation with the
Imperial authorities, and under the advice of experienced
Imperial officers, so far as this is consistent with the
principle of local self-government, which has proved so
great a factor in the promotion of Imperial unity.
J*
To Canadians it appears axiomatic that if they
are an independent State they ought to build up
military and naval forces of their own, rather than
send money to any other State, of equal or un-
equal rank with them, to be expended by it. That
we are under one Crown is no reply to this. If it
is, then I say : “ Canada has a magnificent lot of
men engaged in her fisheries, as well fitted for
naval employment as many men in the British
Isles ; but Canada’s income must very largely be
spent upon her growth ; let. therefore, the United
Kingdom remit to Ottawa a couple of mill.ons
annually to be spent by Canada in the creation of
a Canadian Navy.” That would appear to our
British brothers to be a very ridiculous proposition,
but it is really quite as sensible as the sugges-
tion that the cheque should go from Canada.
To my mind, it is perfectly clear that Canada’s
contribution to defence must be along the lines
of national growth. She must strengthen herself,
train her own men, maintain her own forces, and
thus learn to do her own fighting. In the past
Canada has done her share, and more than her
share, in the Empire's wars—wars which she had
no share in causing, and as to which her opinion
was not asked. It is now proposed that, besides
continuing war help, she should contribute to the
peace establishment, not of the Empire, but of the
United Kingdom. She has declined to do so.
And she is right. Let each part prepare itself in
time of peace. The whole will thus be the stronger
when conies the stress.
**
Canada intends to control her own affairs. Her
affection for the United Kinydoiti is deep and in-
disputable, but her national status precludes the
possibility of submission, to any yoeernance but her
own.
Almost every word of this pictures the atti-
tude which a patriotic Australian would wish
adopted by Australia.
THE AUSTRALIAN ATTITUDE
rpHE Senate discussion of the Copy-
| right Bill on 4 Oct. raised the general
question of Australian policy in
relation to Great Britain. Senator
Givens appeared as the constitutional
champion of Australia ; Senator Keating as
defender of the rights and privileges of
Britain.
Scientifically speaking, the essence of
life is growth. The test' of a living organ-
ism is its inherent power to add cell to cell,
to replace a worn-out cell with one newly
adapted to the environment of life. Lacking
that power, it is dead ; losing that power, it
decays and dies.
The Constitution of the Commonwealth,
though an abstract thing, is to all intents
and purposes a living organism. It is a
legislative measure couched in such-and-
such words, contained in so many sections
and clauses ; and these words and sections
and clauses bound it and control it. But if
it contains the principle of life, they do not
prevent it from growing ; and if it loses that
principle, they cannot prevent it from decay -
iug. Ihe words of its text are the necessary
definitions of its living spirit ; but £hey are
not themselves that spirit. And since the
Constitution is effective only when it comes
in contact with living, men and women,—
since its force can be measured only by the
application of its force, —the view expressed
in this paragraph is not merely an imagina-
tive idea, but represents to all w'ho live
under the Constitution an actual fact.
As far as the language of the Constitution
goes, the Constitution is limited ; and
that is the whole extent of'its limitation.
But language is an indefinite .thing : it
means one thing to one man at one
time, and another thing to another man at
another time or. at the same time. Its use
and value depend upon the common sub-
tratum of meaning that men attach to it ;
and even this varies. In relation to the
Commonwealth, the language of the Consti-
tution is a hedge ; not a wall. It is not an
impassable barrier : it is a barrier through
which the spirit of the Constitution may
grow, above which it may stretch branches
to the territory beyond. And the hedge
does not surround it completely : there are
gaps at several points. Even verbally, the
precise power and authority of the Constitu-
tion are in several directions a matter of doubt.
And the boundaries of the hedge itself can be
altered at any time to suit British colonial
policy, which has been and can be varied in
response to Australian pressure.
J*
The metaphor accurately presents the fact.
We have a tree of national life surrounded
by a legal hedge. The tree may grow or
decay ; the hedge may remain, or be removed,
or grow till it overshadows and dwarfs or
kills the tree. For the hedge also is a living
thing, and can flourish or decay from pre-
cedent to precedent.
The Commonwealth has two ways of facing
the situation : it can look first at the tree,
or it can look first at the hedge. In relation
to copyright, Senator Givens looks first at
the tree. He says : Whatever becomes of
legal barriers, it is essential that Australia
should develop toward the fullest freedom
and independence. The hedge exists : it
may be necessary at present that it should
exist ; but where there is a choice between
two modes of action, -let us promote the
growth of the tree and not the growth of the
hedge. Let us press down the hedge when-
ever and wherever possible, remembering that
all the reactionary forces support it, and that
it has a constant tendency to encroach further
and further upon the plot of ground set apart
for the tree.
Senator Keating looks first at the hedge.
He is impressed with the strength and extent
of the hedge. He accepts all the advances
or encroachments that have been made by
the hedge, and he does not admit the ex-
pediency of pressing continually forward at
the gaps. If the national tree, by dint of
being clipped here and impeded there,
becomes dwarfed or decays, Senator Keat-
ing will persist that this is due to the irre-
sistible right of the hedge to encompass and
overshadow it.
In the copyright discussion, Senator Giyens
defended Australian privilege against Britain;
Senator Keating defended British privilege
against Australia. The one stood up for
our rights ; the other lay down with them.
J*
The whole of Australian policy with rela-
tion to Britain is in those attitudes. It is
not a matter of copyright only ; it is a
matter of every subject of legislation in
which the constitutional authority emitted
by Britain can be extended or limited.
Extension means growth ; growth means
life. Limitation means decay ; decay means
death. Canada has never doubted what
should be the choice of Canadians. Surely
there can be no doubt of the choice o.
Australians.
CRUMBS SWEPT UP
IN the Copyright Bill, Senator Keating’s un-
Australian attitude was responsible for an
illogical clause. Clause 62 ran :
Nothing in this Act shall take away from or
lessen the protection enjoyed in Australia in relation to
copyrights and performing rights by virtue of any Act of
the Parliament of the United Kingdom in force at any
time in the Commonwealth or any State or part of the
Commonwealth.
Senator Keating had previously affirmed that
the Imperial Copyright Acts’ would remain in force
in the Commonwealth notwithstanding anything
in the Commonwealth Copyright Bill. —Therefore
this clause was superfluous.
Senator Keating had previously shown that the
Imperial Copyright Acts are complicated or badly
drawn or inadequate.—Therefore this clause was
wrong to endorse them.
Yet Senators Keating, Drake, Pearce, Playford,
M. Smith, Turley, and G. Henderson voted to
retain the clause—which the Senate excised on the
motion of Senator Givens. That is, they voted to
apply to the Commonwealth certain Imperial
Acts, confused or imperfect, which apply in-
dependently of their vote. —Therefore the con-
stituents of these Senators should examine the
wits of these Senators.
Senator Keating, referring to “the Canadian
Constitution in connexion with Canadian copy-
right legislation ” ( Hansard, 3108) :
would point out that the position of Canada is totally
different in this regard from the position of Australia.
Senator Keating is mistaken. So far from being
“totally different,” the, power conferred by the
Canadian Constitution in regard to copyright—
considering federal history, legislative circum-
stances, and instrumental language—is analogous
to the power conferred by the Australian Constitu-
tion in regard to copyright. Australia possesses a
power of equal extent, governed by the same pre-
cedents, in its incidence fully similar. Senator
Keating has admitted this inferentially by quoting
the decisions of Canadian courts as guides to the
Senate.
A subsequent passage suggests that Senator
Keating did not intend the meaning which his
words strictly convey. He referred to Canada’s
“peculiar situation” in relation to the U.S.A.
But if Senator Keating meant that this situation
creates in Canada a copyright position “totally
different ’’ from that of Australia, he is equally
mistaken.
■ The chief interests of authors in regard to dopy-
right—protection and profit—are the same in Aus-
tralia and m Canada.
The chief interest of readers in regard to copy-
right-literature accessible and cheap—is the same
in Australia and in Canada.
The chief interests of industry in regard to copy-
right—employment and profit—are the same in
Canada and in Australia.
Australian and Canadian interests are prac-
tically the same. Australian and Canadian con-
ditions by law can be made practically the same.
Where then does the “total difference” exist?
Partly in geography—which can’t be helped ; but
mostly in Senator Keating’s imagination—which
should be mended.
*
Senator Keating, defending the opinions of the
British Crown Law officers, credited “those men
for giving expression to what they, in the light of
their learning and knowledge, held as an honest
opinion.”
Nevertheless :
The opinion of British Crown Law officers is
not given as a judicial decision, and has not the
weight of a judicial decision. It is given partly
on the ground of expediency ; and, in deciding
what is expedient, British Crown Law officers are
British. Quite properly—from a British point,of
view—they are apt to take the least liberal view
of the powers of a colonial constitution, though a
more liberal view may be equally within the law.
Without judicial responsibility, yet not without
bias, their opinions should be considered with
reserve and accepted with caution.
Senator Keating said ( Hansard, 3112): —
..As CopiAger says, the Canadian Acts have been
framed with a greater regard for their [printers’ and pub-
lishers’] interests than for the interests of either authors
or reading public.
Did Copinger say so, Copinger would be in
error. As Copinger does not say so, it is Senator
Keating who is in error. Copinger does say. in
reference to One particular Canadian Act (1889),
as correctly quoted by Senator Keating (3112) :
The passing of this Act—conceived in the interests
rather of Canadian printers and publishers than of either
authors.or the reading public—led, etc.
That Act was passed in that direction, seeing
that the • interests of authors and the reading
public were already fully protected by previous
copyright Acts. Senator Keating converts
singular to plural, and misapplies the policy
of one Act to cover a long course of legislation.
In Mel. B. Spurr; hit life , work, ivritings, and
recitations (Lond., A. Brown & Sons ; 2s. 6d. net),
H. A. Spurr gives a brotherly account of the
clever entertainer whose death in Melbourne last
year was so widely lamented. There are many
portraits of Spurr (his full name was Melancthon
Burton), and a selection of material that enables
one to see for how much his personality counted
in his programmes.
In a Lond. pamphlet on Indian administration,
C. J. O’Donnell, a retired Indian civil servant, points out
that in 1900 he, with others, presented to the Secretary
of State a petition praying that, where Indian land revenue
is paid directly by the cultivators, as in most parts of
Madras and Bombay, the Government demand should be
limited to SQ % of the calm of the net produce, after a
liberal deduction for cultivation expenses has been made.
A newspaper commentator, expressing h s amazement in
italics, adds that the landlord is in an equally unsatis-
factory position, for of his rental between w] and 10 per
cut is absorbed by the State.—But, as Lord Salisbury
blandly remarked, fflridia must be bled.”

Ethel Mills writes of Lond. experience :—
I have not found it hard to see editors in London.
To me they have been in variably “ in ” and chatty. The
main difficulty is to “get read’’—Englishmen won’t be
hurried. Nothing shocks an English editor so much as
the suggestion that he should bustle. I owe my
first lift to a young editor with a conscience. I was
“hard up,” of course (no Australian ever comes to
London prepared for wholesale robbery in tips and
“extras”); and I sold several stories to the editor of
Pearson's Weekly for less than I would have got in
Australia. After a time his conscience awoke (I suppose),
and he absolutely refused a story I submitted, his reason
being that it was worth more than a penny paper could
afford to pay. But the money was wanted badly, and I
called in person and said he could have the story at his
own price. He gave me a serious lecture, and advised
taking it to a first-class magazine ; so I departed with my
refused MS. I did not think it a good story particularly,
and (not being at all convinced) I tried it on other penny
papers and a fourpenny magazine. I received an eager
offer of a small sum from the latter ; but by that time I
had begun to think that a London editor might possibly
know more than I did, so I declined the “fourpenny”
offer, and sent the story to a shilling magazine, getting a
cheque for 6gs. (2500 words) and a request for more.
My experience of the short-story market here induces
me to give this advice to the author whose work has
received Australian approval: Fly high or fly not at all.
Constance Clyde told me that she had come to the same
conclusion after being refu ed by cheap publications and
accepted by the better ones.
A. H. Adams is perfectly correct in what he says about
clothes in London. He recommends a silk hat as an
open sesame. I advise a very freshly-starched white
muslin frock and a black picture hat. The offices of even
the biggest Lond. publisher look cramped and dull and
dingy after our own fine buildings, and it is better not to
dress to match them. White book-muslin shows well
against the sad-coloured furniture of the average literary
waiting-room, and the office-boy cannot well pretend he
has not seen you.

Eight Years’ Suffering.
A PERMANENT CURE.
The Case of Mrs. A> WEAVER.
(By a Sydney Reporter.)
.No one can tell the self-denying work
which good men have done in the early
days of this country, neither can _we
exaggerate the nobleness of spirit
which animates present-day people in a
desire to ameliorate distress as much
as lies in their power. Therefore, the
public should be informed of some of
these efforts, one of which was made
by Mrs. Alice Weaver, of No. 7 Louis-
street, Redfern, who replied to the re-
porter by saying
‘‘About this time last year I was
living in Telopea-street, and it was
just before I left there for this place
that I was fortunate in casting aside a
complaint that had worried me for no
less than eight years. What a fearful
life of suffering mine had been all that
time, to be sure, and to think that
nothing in the world could benefit me
made my spirits droop lower than
they will ever be again, I hope.”
“What made you think that nothing
could benefit you queried the
writer.
“I arrived at that conclusion because
nothing had done me good so far, and
I believe I tried every medicine going.
At the time my second child was born
I was under a doctor who did every-
thing he could for me, but still my
health remained as bad as it could be.
Indeed, at that period I was nearly
dead with indigestion, although I diet-
ed myself and did all that could be
done to keep my torments in check.
It was of no avail though, for when I
ate anything I could hardly breathe
owing, to a feeling which' came like a
lump in my chest, from which place a
sharp pain went right through to the
centre of my shoulders. I then remain-
ed in the utmost agony until the food
was vomited up again, after which I
felt so exhausted that . I could not
think of doing a thing in the house
until I. had had a good rest. It would
surprise you if you only knew how
poor my appetite was'. You would
wonder how anybody could keep alive
with it, and as for my head —oh ! my
sufferings with it were'awful. The most
piercing pains at one time and the
most depressing aches at another.
Really, I think it was a marvel how I
kept my senses with the agony I en-
dured in the head, and it’s strange
that, I didn’t meet with many a nasty
accident through the giddiness which
used to overtake me.”
. ‘‘Why ? Were you ever seized with it
in the street V”
“Often I was attacked when walking
down the road, when my sight would
leave me, and I felt horrible ; and suf-
fering so long had played havoc with
my nervous system, too. I would stand
for an hour at the corner of a street
before I would dare to cross it, and
when I made up my mind it was) gene-
rally just as a tram or something was
passing, and I’d have to run bade out
of the way. that was always my
trouble. I could not make up my
mind to do a thing for a long while,
and when I did it invariably turned
but wrong, which showed that ner-
vousness can throw a person's mind
into a state of confusion. But I’m not
all like that now. I can dodo-e in
and out of the thickest traffic." and
never have the slightest fear of o-et-
ting down ; I can walk about in'the
dark at any hour . of the night, and
not feel the least bit afraid, though it
is only a year since I was so nervous
that l coulcln t do such things if 1 had
been given a thousand pounds.”
“flow do you account for such an
extraordinary change ?”
“It’s easy to do that. It was Cle-
ments Tonic which effected the altera-
tion and to my last day on earth I
shall feel grateful to that remedy for
the way it pulled me round, for when
I started with it I was so reduced in
flesh that there was only the frame of
me left, and often and often I. felt fit
only to go away and lie down and diel
L was a misery to myself and every-*
body around me, and to tell you the
honest truth I never thought 1 would
live through it all. All the years I
was ailing there didn’t seem to be a
solitary tiling that went right. My
eyes used to ieel heavy enough to drop
out of their sockets, and I was affected
in the mouth by such a bitter taste
that it made me ieel sick of a morning
after putting in the usual restless
nights that had done so much to-
wards making a wreck of me. If I
slept at all 1 dreamt such awful
things about the children that I used
to call out for help, and on awaking
would find myself bathed in perspira-
tion and trembling like a leaf. Even
in the daytime I was always imagin-
ing something terrible was going to
happen, although it never came to
pass, but still that fact did not keep
me from getting as gloomy and sad-
hearted as ever woman was. And
these were just the very thing's that
Clements Tonic showed itself to be the
master of, for it sent such vigour
through my frame when I had been
taking it a couple of weeks that 1
could not help feeling joyful in the be-
lief that at last my health had taken
a beneficial turn. 1 got more Clements
Tonic, and as each bottle was finished
so did my prospects improve, for I
commenced to take my meals with a
degree of heartiness which astonished
my people as much as it pleased them,
and to my own satisfaction and de-
light the former discomforts attending
mv meals were quickly out of exist-
ence. An overloaded sensation in the
stdmach, which made my clothes fee!
too tight for me, had been one of my
annoyances, and I used to belch up
wind frequently ; but a short course oi
Clements Tonic got those troubles un-
der, besides removing from, my loins
the aches that were particularly pain-
ful whenever I had to bend down foi
anything. Oh, dear ! What a changec
woman I am now to then ! My limbs
do not ache from weakness like they
formerly did, and I can go about mv
work as cheerfully and as actively as
any housewife in the country. I do not
spend any restless nights now, nevei
dream during my sleep, and the pains
that used to abound have long since
been driven away from every part ol
my body.”
“And have you had no physical
troubles whatever since you were
cured ?”
“Not in any shape or form, and now
when I go to see any of my old
friends they laugh to see me looking so
well, and it’s enough to make them
considering I was so like death a year
ago. Well, Clements Tonic made me
the healthy woman I am, and for the
sake of other sufferers I trust you’ll
publish this interview in any way you
think best.”-
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, ALICE WEAVER, of No. 7 Louis-

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sea Waves.
Lifting up their helpless hands they come in
supplication;
Or they knock in futile frenzy at the fastened
door;
And their voices vainly cry for reconciliation,
To the silent Land that scorns them—spurns them
from its shore.
So they rear their reckless hands, and rush with
dreadful daring,
And they fling themselves with fury on the front-
ing wall;
Creamy casques go crashing—then a sob of deep
despairing,
And their souls sigh out in spindrift as they
fainting fall.
Or their mood is changed to softness, and they
wander wooing,
Murmuring Love’s mellow music immemorial,
As th >y curl and nestle closer with caressing
cooing,
And with whispers coax the Land that answers not
at all.
Thus the Waves go stirring ever—beat and beat
eternal;
Or they wheedle, and they whisper, to the Land’s
locked breast;
Seeking for the secret hidden by the Great
Supernal
Who has set the Seas to seek it, and denied them
rest.

Life’s Voyage.
Upon a course uncharted,
When wind and tide were fair,
In youth we sailed light-hearted
From out the port of Care;
We sought the Golden Treasure
In Fancy’s fertile realm ;
We flew the flag of Pleasure,
And Folly held the helm.
Our messmates all were gifted
With gifts the sordid lack,
And scorned the crews who drifted
Along the charted track.
By Hope’s bright beacon steering
We ploughed the summer sea,
And laughed when we were hearing
The Siren’s song a-lee.
The summer seas are clouded,
The star of Hope has set,
The dreams of Youth are shrouded
In wet mists of Regret.
We see that those less gifted
Are safe from storm and wrack,
And wish that we had drifted
Along a charted track.

Inspirer, thou hast come again.
With all that promise in thy train
Thou sangest me last Spring.
I do rejoice to see thee here,
Just to replenish my small cheer
From joyance thou dost bring.
The earth-worm turneth in the sun,
The ants in endless chain do run
About my house’s eaves;
And I, a gloomy book-worm, sit
And hear thee sing, and singing, flit
Among the budding leaves.
The sun, the light, the earth and sky,
The ant, the worm, and thou and I,
But links are in the plan
That sees this cloudy world take on
Its seasons from the burning zone,
Ignoring little man.
Poor man, exploring mysteries
Of life and death, nor finding ease
In one or in the other.
He lives and writes a petty sage,
Then dies and leaves a dubious page
To trip his stumbling brother.

The Back Lane.
Let richer lovers sing the groves
And fragrant orange bowers,
Where with their Phyllises they rove
Amid the doves and flowers ;
For me there’s but the narrow lane
Where orange-peel and pale
Dead cabbage-leaves from many yards
Give fragrance to the gale.
It’s when the crash of dinner-plates
At eight begins to wane,
To meet my Myra at the gate
I sidle up that lane—
No dove coos to its fellow dove
As her dear name I call,
But sweet to me the very noise
Her cat makes on the waul.
If Angelina and her Ned
In quiet ocean nook,
While gath’ring shells, still gather love
From ev’ry lingering look,
My love and I can pace the strand
Of soapsuds on our way,
And tread upon the oyster-shells
The kids play with by day.
No parting kiss can be more sweet
In palace or in hall
Than Myra’s o’er the rubbish tin
Inside the boss’s wall;
No heart than mine more fully feels
Felicity or pain,
As, in or out with Myra dear,
I tread that narrow lane.

HOME, whether it be palace or cottage, is suggestive of comfort, and to secure
a comfortable home the rich spare no expense. It cannot, therefore, be
said that the reason so many of the homes of the well-to-do are being roofed
with RUBEROID is because of cheapness. Comfort and durability are the
chief merits of RUBEROID; its cheapness is only a secondary consideration.

THE MAORILAND LAND PROBLEM.
Apparently Premier Seddon, of Maoriland is
weakening a little on the land question, and hardly
knows for certain whether to cast his vote with
the freehold crowd or with the advocates of State
leasehold. The backbone of the Maoriland lease-
hold system is, or was, supposed to be the famous
“ lease in perpetuity.” This is a well-meant but
unwise device whereby a man may take up land
on a 999-years lease, paj'ing an annual rental equal
to 4 per cent, of its value when taken up, and
in all the 999 years the land can’t be re-valued or
the rental increased. A city like London or Paris
may grow up beside one of these leaseholds, and
the land for which the leaseholder pays £lO or £2O
or £3O a year may become worth many dozen
times that amount, but the ground landlord (the
State) can’t raise the rent till some time in the
thirtieth century. This amazing tenure was
devised, by the late John McKenzie—a man
who was an advanced democrat in land matters,
and the bitterest of Tories in all others. He
was a brawny Highlander whose early recoilec-
-1 tions were of the savage evictions done by Scotch
] landlords, when they turned adrift the best fight-
ing material of Great Britain to make room for
wild animals to be shot at in the summer by
Cockney Jews and rich share-jobbers. The lesson
was burned into McKenzie’s mind, and he set
himself to devise a tenure under which the poor
man could take up land without fear of being
either rack-rented or ejected. He did it so well
that, in his anxiety to consider the man on the
land to-day, he, to a great extent, forgot the man
who would want to get on the land to-morrow.
Also he provided so successfully against the poor
farmer being rack-rented or ejected from his hold-
ing that he set that poor farmer on the way to
being a very rich and arrogant Tory, who may
rob the State wholesale instead of being himself
roblied by his over lord. The poor Highland
crofter and the haughty Highland landlord were
so much before McKenzie’s eyes that he forgot
that it was possible, by over-lavish concessions to
the crofter, with whom he sympathised, to turn
him into a small but very fair copy of the land-
lord whom he hated.
* o * *
The mistake of the 999-years lease without re-
valuation is now obvious. Many of the lands
which were taken up about 1892, on a rental of
4 per cent, of their then value, are already, by
reason of the progress of the State, very much
under-valued. That, of course, is liable to happen
even under an ordinary 20 or 30 or 50 years lease,
but the country now begins to realise how immense
an amount of revenue it is liable to lose when these
leases have lasted into their second century, and
even then there will be over 800 years of increasing
loss ahead. Over this matter quite a number of
curious things are happening. The 999-years
lease-holders have got past the stage at which
they pictured themselves as being all their lives
humble tillers of the soil, living a life of modest
comfort. They are truculently demanding per-
mission to break their agreement and buy their
lands —not at present value, but at the value
which they bore when the lease commenced. Some
of them profess to fear that their great profits or
prospective profits will induce the State to com-
pulsorily buy them out, and assign this as the
reason for their agitation. The real fact is that
the McKenzie Land Act gave, at an infinitesimal
rent, a tenure so nearly equal to freehold that the
lease was itself an asset on which money could be
raised, therefore a farmer could start without
capital, and could even get the loan of capital.
Thus, in a well-watered and fertile country, where
a fast-growing manufacturing population supplied
a market right at the farmer’s door, men who
were without a penny ten years ago are now rich.
And they want the freehold, partly that they may
get rid of the name of being mere State tenants
and bloom forth as real landowners ; partly that
they may be free of some of the conditions under
which they got their amazingly-cheap land. Then
they hope, in many cases, without fear of unplea-
sant interference from their landlord—the State—
to let out their properties to rack-rented tenants,
and become themselves just the type of Highland
laird that the 999-years lease was to make im-
possible.
* * * *
Maoriland also has, alongside the 999-years
system, a method whereby land can be leased for
25 years at a higher rental than under the per-
petual lease, but with the right of purchase. A
dozen years ago this system was less availed of
than it is now. In those days people had less
faith in the future of the State than they have to-
day. Also the settler was then desperately poor ;
the Jeshurun who has waxed fat aud kicked
had hardly a kick in him at the beginning of the
Ballance-Seddon regime. Now the small extra
cliaTge for the right of purchase is a matter of
much less concern, and the unearned increment
looms larger and is a greater inducement, and
much more land is being taken up with the right
of purchase than under the lease m perpetuity. It
is recognised as a shorter and surer road to the
blessed status of a squireen with rack-rented
tenants under him. The poor settler of a few
years ago who rented land with the right of pur-
chase is in a fair way in many cases to become an
arrogant Scotch laird on a small scale, and the man
with the 999-years lease intends, by hook or by
crook, to get his freehold also and be a small arro-
gant laird likewise. He can be one already, but
he wants the name as well as the fact, and the
pomp as well as the bullocks and the pumpkins. And
experience has shown that the settler who has given
up the active personal pursuit of agriculture, and
who lets a couple of small farms to tenants, can
be quite as cruel a rack-renter as the one who
lets 100 farms. Poor old John McKenzie, who,
with the starved Highland crofter before his eyes,
devoted his life to devising some means to make
such a being impossible in Maoriland, must turn
in his grave these days. The evil that haunted
him hasn’t quite arrived yet, but it certainly will
arrive if means are not taken to avert it.
* * * *
The Maoriland land system, though it was a vast
improvement on anything attempted in Australia,
apparently started on a wrong basis. It was an
honest and vigorous attempt, made by honest and
vigorous men, to find a remedy for some of the
world’s worst evils, but it didn’t go far enough and
didn’t strike the evil at the root. As a matter of
fact, it matters little or nothing whether land is
called leasehold and pays rent to the State, or is
called freehold and pays land-tax to the State,
provided the land is fairly divided, that it is
worked to the best advantage, that the man who
works it is also the man who gets the profit of it,
and that there is no loafing, idle, parasitic
landlord class —men who do not cultivate
but who live by levying blackmail on those
who do. If the State owns the land, then every
citizen has, in theory, an equal undivided share
in the public estate; but if the public estate is
leased out for long periods to a small class at far
below its value, the robbery is not such an
improvement on the old landlord robbery as might
be supposed. The man who gets a 999-years lease
is practically a freeholder, and if, as is quite
probable, his present rental of £4 per cent, on the
value becomes one day, though increase of value,
something like ss. per cent., then he may easily
be paying less to the State for the land than many
a real freeholder in a landlord-cursed country
pays in land-tax. On the other hand, if the land
is privately-owned, but is closely and rigidly
sub-divided, and the loafing landlord is eliminated,
and the land pays a fair share of taxation, the
individual citizen may come much nearer to
getting his just share of the public estate than
under the system of nominal State ownership.
The ideal freehold system is one which would
severely limit the amount of land which can be
held by one individual, which would make the
land pay such a proportion of taxation that there
would be a limit to the accumulation of fancy or
bogus values, and which would always tend to
make the occupier also the owner. The State
now gives to its 25-years tenants a lease with the
option of purchase, and the State’s 999-years tenant
wants the option of purchase also, though that isn’t
in his bond. What is good for the State’s tenant
is also good for the private owner’s tenant. He
also should have, in every case, the option of pur-
chase from his landlord. Moreover, he should
have the option of purchase at a fair valuation,
fixed by an independent authority—the State—
and when he, in turn, retires from active business
and wants to let his farm or other property, he
should also have to give his tenant the option of
purchase at a fair valuation, fixed by the same
independent authority. Though this system
could not be applied to town premises occupied
by a number of tenants, the occupier of a
town building, of which he is the single tenant,
should have the same right of compulsory
purchase. There should be a systematic attempt
to decide what area each man may fairly own in
cities, towns, farming districts, and pastoral dis-
tricts (in the two last cases the quality of the soil
would have to be taken into consideration), so as
to get reasonably near to the ideal condition in
which every farmer, if he so desires, can possess his
own farm, and every town-dweller his own house ;
and the holding of areas in excess of this should be
systematically discouraged by a heavy graduated
land-tax, and, if necessary, by even stronger
measures. The idea kept in view should be that
the individual who simply receives rent —the idle
blackmailer who is a great financial caterpillar
eating up the produce of others—should be, as far
as possible, abolished. He should be regarded as
a public wrong and treated accordingly. The man
who has money for investment need even then find
no lack of outlets. He could always put his surplus
funds into local or foreign State and municipal se-
curities or into manufacturing enterprises. But he
would be a rarer individual than he is now. There
would be a far higher standard of general wealth,
but there would be not nearly so many poor, and
not nearly so many very rich standing Up like
financial towers above a low-lying waste of impe-
cuniosity.
* * *
Maoriland is now seriously considering whether
its land system requires alteration, and whether
it will not, after all, give its 999-years
State tenants, who represent well over a
million acres, the right of purchase on easy
terms. If it decides that it should do so, logic
absolutely demands that it should give all other
tenants the same right of purchase on fair terms.
If the State is held to be a failure as a landlord
despite the easy rental conditions it has imposed,
then it can be fairly assumed that private indi-
viduals, who have imposed much worse conditions,
are a worse failure. If it is right for the State as
a landlord to be held up by its tenants, then the
same treatment is fair to all other landlords. The
State’s tenants say that their position as tenants
is unpleasant—some of them call it intolerable—•
and if that is so they certainly should not
be allowed to become landlords in their turn, and
make the conditions of other people still more
intolerable, nor should any other people of their
kind be allowed to do so. They claim, and it is
claimed by other people on their behalf, that the
noble home sentiment —the desire of every man to
possess a spot which is his very own—has been so
deeply implanted by Providence in the human
soul that it overrides all written agreements ; and
that even a 999-years tenure at an almost nominal
rent does not fill the void. In that case the yearn-
ing created by Providence in the soul of the man
who has only a monthly tenancy or a short lease,
from a private landlord, at a much higher rental,
should also be considered, and, as his is the worse
case, it should be considered first. If the alleged
home sentiment is intended to over-ride agreements
made with a State landlord then it must be
superior to agreements with every kind of land-
lord. This home sentiment is worth inquiring into.
THE NAVAL AGREEMENT.
Most Australians are under an impression that
the naval defence of Australia is adequately pro-
vided for under an agreement entered into
between the Commonwealth and the British
Admiralty in 1902, and ratified by a Federal
statute in 1903. They don’t know much about the
matter; they remember hearing of some fuss in
connection with it some time ago, but they were
busy making money, or playing cricket, and they
soon torgot all about it. Anyhow, they suppose
it’s “all right,” because they see some powerful
looking war ships in Farm Cove when they go to
Manly, and they read from time to time about a
Potts Point girl marrying a naval officer. And
these cricket players, also the money-makers,
probably won’t mind much when they are in-
formed that it is by no means all right; that the
naval defence of Australia is not as good as it was
10 years ago, though it is costing nearly twice as
much money; that the agreement between the
British Admiralty and the Commonwealth has not
been carried out, and the Admiralty gives no evi-
dence of intending to carry it out; that even if it
were carried out, it would not provide in any
adequate way for Australian naval defence.
There are, however, a good many Australians
who are something more than mere cricket-
players and money-makers, and they may be
interested to hear of the above facts, and to read
the evidence in support of them.
w * * *
Before the year 1902, the force which supplied
the naval defence of Australia consisted of two
distinct branches. There was, first, the ordinary
Imperial squadron on the Australian Station,
with which Australia had nothing to do; and,
second, an Australasian squadron of seven ships,
for the defence of our coastal trade. This coast-
defence squadron was supplied under an agree-
ment, made in 1887, between the Australasian
Parliaments and the Admiralty. Under that
agreement, Australia, in return for an annual pay-
ment of £106,000, obtained the coast defence
squadron above referred to, in addition to the
existing Imperial squadron on the Australian
station. The agreement also provided that the
coast defence ships should not, either in peace or
war, be removed beyond the limits of the Aus-
tralian Station without the consent of the Aus-
tralian Governments. It is stamped all over the
face of the 1887 agreement that the Australasian
squadron was intended solely for the defence of
floating trade on the Australasian coasts. In
1902, however, a new agreement was entered into,
which was ratified by an Act of the Federal Par-
liament in 1903. Under this agreement, the sub-
sidy to be paid by Australia was raised to £200,000.
In return for this, the Admiralty was to
maintain on the Australian Station a naval
force consisting of one first-class armored cruiser,
two second-class cruisers, four third-class cruisers,
and four sloops. There was also to be maintained
a Royal Naval Reserve of 25 officers and 700 men.
Three of the ships were to be used as drill ships,
and these, together with one of the other vessels,
were to be manned as far as possible by Aus-
tralians and Maorilanders. It was explained at
the time that this arrangement would involve the
permanent employment of over 800 Australians,
who, with the 725 of the Naval Reserve, would
form the nucleus of an Australian naval force,
numbering about 1600. This feature of the scheme
was made prominent in order to reconcile those
who were in favor of an Australian navy. The
training of 1600 Australians as naval seamen,
would, it was claimed, make the work of starting
such a navy, when the time came for it, incom-
parably easier.
* # i * *
This 1902 agreement was wholly bad, from
every point of view. It was bad in principle,
because it amounted simply to the hiring of our
naval defence from another country. It was bad
in detail, because in the first place it contained no
provision which secured the ships for the defence
of Australian coasting trade in time of war; in
the second place it did not provide for the training
of a single Australian officer; in the third place,
the arrangements for the training of the men were
such that, if they made sailors of those who enlist,
they must be British and not Australian sailors.
Under the scheme drawn up for the carrying out
of this agreement the men who enlist in the crew
of the drill ships, or of the other ship which is to
be manned by Australians and Maorilanders, serve
for a definite period, are then 'discharged and, if
they choose, taken into the Reserve. This system
is not calculated to attract men who have a steady
job. If we want sailors in Australia, we must
offer men an employment at least as permanent as
the work they are asked to give up. This, added
to the fact that the scheme does not provide for
the training of Australian officers, makes the
inducements held out to believers in an Australian
navy wholly illusory.
• * • *
The 1902 agreement is not only bad in principle
and in detail; it has been bad in its immediate
results on our local naval forces. Before that
agreement there was at least an attempt at real
local naval defence. Queensland and Victoria in
particular, in a small way, had a system that was
at any rate capable of being developed into a use-
ful and effective weapon for coast and harbor
defence. Australians were being trained as per-
manent naval seamen. The system was nothing
to boast of, it is true. But it had possibilities
which the Commonwealth might well have
developed. Since the 1902 agreement, no Federal
Government seems to have been able to make up
its mind what to do about the purely local forces.
It was fully understood at the time that the new
arrangement did not provide for coast and harbor
defence. That was explicitly stated by Prime
Minister Barton in his speech on the Naval
Agreement Bill. But nothing has been done to
remedy this defect by the establishment of any
effective system of coast and harbor defence. The
first means to be adopted for this purpose are, as
Senator Matheson recently showed, the provision
of torpedo boats and destroyers. Instead of
making such provision, the Commonwealth policy
has practically destroyed the elementary system
of coast and harbor defence we formerly had,
with all its possibilities. This result is directly
traceable to the Naval Agreement, with its
increased subsidy, and its illusory promises of a
local naval defence force.
* • • *
The 1902 agreement, therefore, would be bad,
even if we were getting from it every advantage
it is capable of giving. But we are not getting by
any means all the advantages from it that are
possible. As a matter of fact, the agreement has
been, and is still being, practically disregarded by
the Admiralty. The first article stipulates for
one first-class armored cruiser. The Euryalus
answers to this description. She has, however,
been withdrawn, and her place is to be taken by
the Powerful, which, though a bigger and faster
ship, is not armored, and is vastly inferior in
fighting strength to the Euryalus. This is a
deliberate and open breach of the agreement. The
same article stipulates for two second-class
cruisers. Although three years have gone by
since the agreement was drawn up, there is only
one second-class cruiser on the station. This is
another open disregard of the compact. We were
also to have four third-class cruisers, of modern
type. There are seven third-class cruisers on the
station, but four out of these seven have been con-
demned as useless by the Admiralty. The agree-
ment stipulated for four sloops: at present there
is only one. Therefore, as far as the number of
ships is concerned, the agreement has not been
carried out in a single detail, although three years
have elapsed since it was entered into.
•* * • *
But this is not the only breach of the agreement.
The Royal Naval Reserve was to consist of 700
men and 25 officers. At present, according to an
answer recently given in the Senate by the
Minister of Defence, there are five officers and 233
men enrolled. It was represented by Prime
Minister Barton, when the Naval Agreement
Bill was before the House, that the number of
permanent men employed on the drill-ships and
the other ship to be manned by Australians was to
be 800. This representation was not made, it
may be presumed, without the authority of the
Admiralty. The number of men engaged on
board the ships referred to is at present 390.
This shortage is not due, as may be imagined, to
the fact that men are not applying, but to the
nature of the system which has been adopted for
taking on the permanent men. This system may
be inevitable. This does not alter the fact that
the representations made in order to secure the
passage of the Bill are not being made good.
• * • *
The only term of the Agreement that is being
fully observed is the one which provides for the
payment of £200,000 a year by Australia. It is
quite time the Commonwealth Government inti-
mated politely to the Admiralty that a contract
which is consistently observed on one side and as
consistently broken on the other is not the kind of
contract which Australia wants. It is bad enough
to buy our naval defence from another country.
It is worse to pay for it and not get it. Under
the 1887 Agreement we had a contract bad in
principle, with some redeeming features, faithfully
carried out. Under the present Agreement we
have a contract equally bad in principle, with no
redeeming features, and consistently broken by
the British authorities.
IS AUSTRALIA LANDLESS?
Tiik danger of an incursion of Booth riff-raff to
Australia is for the present averted. It was made
clear to that business-like gentleman, Mr. Booth,
that, however much the Commonwealth desired
population, it had no intention of taking any sort
at any price. That killed the project. Mr.
Booth is accustomed to sell a cheap thing dear.
There was almost a panic in the haste with which
he withdrew from the negotiations as soon as it was
apparent that Australia was inclined to look at the
bargain before buying. For the bargain, he knew,
wouldn’t stand inspection. The customer at the
cheap-jack’s fair who wishes to examine the purse
into which a sovereign has just been (apparently)
put, before buying it for five shillings, is just the
sort of spoil-sport that Australia showed itself in
this Booth immigration matter. So the game is
“off.”
■» * * *
Now that the Booth colony is no longer a live
issue, the proposal it made may be audited
more dispassionately. From what may be
called the “ Imperial ” side of the question,
it is difficult to see how any organised
attempt to attract large colonies of settlers
from Britain can be defended. The rub-
bish of Britain we do not want, nor pretend to
want. But the “sturdy yeomanry,” the men of
excellent character and of moderate means, the
citizens capable of subduing the wilderness, we do
want. And from an Australian view-point we
are quite right to seek to attract them. From an
Imperial standpoint, though, any such efforts are
rather rough on the dear old Mother Country.
We want citizens certainly; so does Britain.
We have areas of good land uncultivated; so
has Britain. We have a great home market
capable, with adequate Protection, of finding em-
ployment for scores of thousands of now citizens :


so has Britain. The Bulletin does m>t profess
to have any inclination to study outside interests
until Australia’s interests are served. But it is
shocked to the very soul at the disloyalty of thos<
ardent Imperialists who would deliberately pro-
mote, by lantern lectures and exhibits of
large pumpkins, the robbery of Britain s
population; especially when at the sam
time they not only connive at, but _ actually
assist in perpetuating, a system of I reetrade
and land monopoly in Australia by which
a big section of the native population is
forced to emigrate to other lands. Ihe Bulletin
■doesn’t have its ideas made m London, but t tie
policy of robbing our mother’s poultry-yard whilst
letting our own chicks escape through carelessness,
seems positively disloyal, even though it has the
heavy-weight approval of Bruce Smith.
• • * *
Apart from that, which is, after all, a minor
■consideration, the most valuable lesson of the
Booth offer is the facts which it has disclosed
about the land position in Australia. 800 lie
•offered to send 5000 families if decent land at a
moderate price were made available for them.
Westralia claimed that it had some land ready -
just a little; but stood aghast at the idea of
finding space for 5000 families. Queensland, not
very definitely, said that it had some land, but
■didn’t rush the idea of 5000 families. Victoria,
:South Australia and Tasmania practically con-
fessed to having no land available for settlement.
N.S. Wales, which generally brings a touch of
broad comedy into a matter of this sort, came
'forward promptly with an offer of the Pilliga
scrub, which no Waler will look at. Ihe
•total answer may be summed up : Australia has
not fair land to offer for the settlement of 5000
.now families.
* * » *
The Australia which made this remark is a con-
tinent that, at the lowest calculation, could find
agricultural employment for 25,000,000 families,
if land could be held for use only, and not for
■speculation, and if a wise tariff system- planted
here a large manufacturing population to
buy the products of the farms. With the
undoubted capacity to support such an agricul-
tural population, it has not 25,000,000, but some
small share of 1,250,000 farming families. Probably
! i than 200,000 families are on the land, for of the
i ,_50,000 or so families which make up the popu-
lation, 250,000 are clustered in two big cities
alone. Agricultural Australia is about the lone-
liest place on earth ; it is almost as lonely as those
parts of Britain which have been laid desolate for
the game preserves of the new Conqueror from
Lombardy, Moses Hoggenheimek, and his train.
Yet, put to the test, Australia has practically to
say that it has no land ready for 5000 new families,
and is able to prove the truth of the statement by
pointing to the fact that Australia’s young men
are leaving the continent because they cannot get
good soil on fair conditions.
* » •» *
For this candid confession of the results of their
lands administration by the State Governments,
Australia owes Booth much thanks. Never before
has it been made so plain that Australia, whilst
wanting agricultural as well as industrial popu-
lation, and whilst having vast areas of good
land, has no land available for settlement;
that it is all in the hands of the living monopolist or
the heirs of the dead monopolist. On the N.S.
Wales coastline there is as much good agricultural
land as in France ; in Victoria there is as much
as in Italy ; in Tasmania as in Belgium ; in South
Australia as in Scandinavia; in Queensland as in
Germany and Austria; in Westralia and the
Northern Territory probably as much as in
Russia. But with nearly the agricultural area
of Europe and the population merely of
Switzerland, Australia has no room for another
5000 families ! The effects of land monopoly could
not be put in a more startling light. They are
silhouetted black against that statement.

From various hints he has given to the news-
papers, Australian Prime Minister Deakin takes
a PucK-like satisfaction in this exposure. He, in
■ common with other intelligent Australians, knows
’.the land position and knows its cause, and hopes
■that this bold advertisement of its effects will have
■ some reform value. The hope will be vain unless
■he, or some other Federal leader, is prepared
ito undertake the work of reform. Little or
.nothing is to be expected from the States. What
•■they have allowed to grow up they , will allow to
■continue. But the Commonwealth can very
promptly secure reform and bring the tide of agri-
cultural immigration to these shores, whilst stop-
ping the very serious emigration. A Federal
graduated land-tax, making it impossible to hold
large estates locked up, rendering the only profit-
able form of land tenure the tenure for use, would
solve the whole problem. Has Prime Minister
Deakin the courage to propose that ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
English Newspaper Maniacs.
The London Economist publishes this from its
real or bogus Melbourne correspondent:—
Mr. Deakin, in common with other Australian poli-
ticians, has been frightened out of his ordinarily frigid
and separatist attitude towards the Mother country by
the great successes of Japan, and by the impression that
Japan will in the future resent insults to color. He is,
therefore, in favor of a kind of treaty of alliance with the
United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand,
all on equal terms. A condition of the alliance is to be an
undertaking that the United Kingdom will, in the event
of war, guarantee that her naval strength shall be devoted
in the first place to the defence of Australia. Any ade-
• quate contribution to the expense of keeping up that
naval strength to be out of the question.
’That yarn suggests one of two things—either that
the Economist keeps no Australian correspondent,
ibut manufactures its Australian news at Bed-
lam, or else {that its Australian correspondent is
.under instructions to forward lies, and does it.
Exactly what the Economist gains by this sort of
thing doesn’t appear, but presumably it hopes, for
some purpose or other, to persuade somebody to
credit yarns like the above, and in so doing it throws
a pretty bad aspersion on the British intelligence.
If an Australian paper announced, as an item of
news from its alleged London correspondent, that
England contemplated an invasion of Russia with
a view to bringing the Czar back » prisoner for
execution with a rusty axe on Tower Hill, the lie
wouldn’t be a shade more ridiculous. The stan-
dard of intelligence, however, is high enough in
Australia to make any such shrieking absurdity a
losing speculation for the papier that published it;
apparently in England the standard of lunacy
among editors and readers is low enough to make
almost anything possible. In this case the
form of the Economist’s slander suggests a
peculiar kink in the English intellect. Australia
E £200,000 a year towards the support of the
sh fleet with the distinct understanding that
no protection or defence whatever is guaranteed in
time of trouble ; the defence of Britain comes first,
and after that is adequately provided for, Australia
may or may not get any protection that is left
over. There are certainly people in Australia
who object to this arrangement. One crowd, re-
presented, to some extent, by Motor-car Kelly,
M H.R., proposes making the subsidy £400,000
instead of £200,000, and still asking for no guaran-
tee of defence. Another crowd proposes that the
subsidy should be abandoned, and that Australia
should build, man, and maintain a fleet reasonably
sufficient for its own defence, and sufficient to be
a material addition to the aggregate defences of
the empire. Amid these conflicting propositions
—that we should continue to pay £200,000 with-
out any assurance of defence, that we should pay
£400,000 without any assurance of defence, and
that we should defend ourselves—the Econo-
mist cheerfully evolves the theory that
we propose to pay nothing, and to de-
mand that we should have first call on the
British navy for protection. It is a wonderfully
crude lie—as crude as that of the school-kid who
says suddenly, for no visible reason, that he saw
an elephant sitting on the fence. Meanwhile
Canada, in wide contrast to Australia, said, in
effect, when it was asked to contribute towards
the support of the British navy, that it would see
England d d first. It has got its naval defence
for nothing through all the years in which
Australia has been paying a subsidy ; and the
visible result is that the lying and malevolent
English editor has nothing but coarse insult for
the country that pays towards naval defence,
while he almost grovels to the one which refuses
to part with a cent. Apparently the Economist
represents a variety of Englishman on whom
courtesy is wasted, and who is only pleasant
towards those who treat him unpleasantly.
+ .
A Commonwealth Mail Fleet.
In the course of a very short time Australia will
again bump up against the problem of the ocean
mail service. The present contract with the
Orient S.S. Co. is little more than a stop-gap,
and when it expires the probabilities are that that
unsatisfactory co. will demand a further increase
of subsidy for the painfully gradual delivery of
our correspondence. Then if it doesn’t imme-
diately get all the increase it demands it will,
presumably, set itself, as it did last time it bailed
up Australia, to be as nasty as possible in a
small, childish way ; also its friends will spread
as many weird slanders about this country
as can be devised. The Stinking Fish party
has elaborated so vast a system of lies,
slanders and misrepresentations concerning Aus-
tralia that it is now impossible to-even argue a
point about increased subsidy with a shabby
little steamship co. without the myth being
announced all over the world that Socialism,
in its most horrible shape, has again broken out.
Taking everything into account, therefore, Aus-
tralia ought to seriously consider whether it can’t
do without mail contracts and run its own mail
fleet as a Government concern, and save this re-
current shindy. A Government steamship line is
quite as feasible as a Government railway line ;
while a subsidised private mail service se»ms in
many cases just as bad a failure as a subsidised
private railway. Of course, there is a lack
of precedent for a Government mail ser-
vice in recent times, but that is all the
more reason for its establishment; to a
vigorous Government there is far more satis-
faction in making precedents than in follow-
ing them. If any Australian company were pre-
pared to take up the business of carrying mails
and passengers between this country and England
it might be advisable to leave things alone, but
apparently there is no such company at present,
and if Australia doesn’t want to be again cor-
nered by its sour and grasping sea-minion when
the present agreement expires, it is essential that
it should do something, and do it quickly. A
Government service of the best and swiftest
vessels would certainly give better satisfaction
than the present arrangement does. But, at the
same time, it would be essential to take every
kind of care that the idea was not brought into
discredit by ill-management, and it wouldn’t
require half the bad management that private
enterprise is often guilty of to bring it into dis-
credit. A Government mail-service Would require
to be run on hard business lines, under the best
expert control, and when that was done there is
no reason why the results should not 'be
wholly satisfactory. In Australia, State rail-
way management has proved, with all its
drawbacks, infinitely better and more success-
ful than the private article, and there is no
positive reason why steamship management should
not do likewise. To give the enterprise a fair
chance, however, it must not be loaded down to
the gunwale with debt; if there is any debt the
loans should carry at least a 2 per cent, sinking-fund
and 5 per cent, renewal fund, so as to make sure
that the fleet will be wholly paid for before
the oldest ship threatens to become obsolete.
The enterprise must be credited with the same
mail subsidy now paid to private ocean carriers.
The wages must be no higher than the current
Australian rate, and no superfluous or inefficient
hands must be carried from motives of philan-
thropy. When State Socialism sets out to justify
itself in a new department of energy there is no
room for philanthropy. General philanthropy be-
longs to the Charities Department, and when a
man becomes too old for his job he is a matter for
the Old Age Pensions office to deal with.

Tasmanian “Land Settlement.”
Tasmania, which is a rather slow little place,
does a periodical wail about “land settlement.”
It is in the middle of that wail now, and the case
seems to fully justify it. Tasmania figures out
that it has sold nearly 440,000 acres of State land
since 1898, and it strikes the alarming fact that
there are 32,000 fewer acres under cultivation than
there were seven years ago before all this land
was sold. In one year (1904) it sold the greatest
extent (132,629 acres) of the public estate to
alleged settlers, and in that one year the area
under cultivation showed the worst decline.
Further, with all this alleged settlement, Tas-
mania is reported as having fewer individual
landholders now than it had a few years ago.
Therefore, it is evident that the mere throwing of
public lands in a large general way to whoever
will buy does not necessarily mean progress. In
Tasmania, where there is no Labor party, large
estates are increasing, and cows are in-
creasing, and rents are increasing, arid debt is
increasing, but agriculture and population
are on the decline. It is the only State which
Shows, at present, an actual loss of population—
the only one in which the export of people not
only accounts for all the increase through excess
of births over deaths, but more than accounts for
it. Also, it is the State which has the most con-
tinuous and longest-standing record for excess of
departures over arrivals. The big landlords of
the island began to crowd the people out as far
back as 1862, and they have been doing so ever
since. All the “ respectable ” daily papers in
Tasmania seem to agree that the situation is a
painful one, and they all hold that “something
must be done ” ; but not one yet suggests that the
big landlord should be struck with a weighty
graduated land-tax to force him to cut up his pro-
perties and put them in the market, and as
for suggesting an absentee-tax, the average
Tasmanian dady would as soon throw a de-
funct cat at the Governor. It is interesting
to read these Tasmanian papers, and notice
how carefully they avoid saying exactly what is
the matter, and how artistically they dodge any
direct statement that the big, somnolent land-
holder who blocks the progress of settlement is
the real evil. Even the most Tory paper of them
all knows that the big somnolent landlord is the
real evil, but the habit of long years of reverence is
still strong, and any direct reference to the matter
is to the Tasmanian editor something akin to blas-
phemy. The most energetic daily in the island
has nothing better to suggest than the selling of
any little State land that remains to more
alleged settlers ; and in deploring the failure of
that same policy in the past it generally says, in a
vague way, that “ if the development of the great
natural resources of the country is consistently
pursued on principles of broad statesmanship a
new era will dawn ” —or thereabouts.

The N.S.W. Mining Bill.
The old trouble about labor conditions arises in
connection with the Mines Bill, which Minister
Moore has introduced to N.S.W. Assembly, to
consolidate and amend the present scattered law.
The proposal in this Bill is, not that labor must
be continuously employed, but that if more is em-
ployed at one time than the very little which the
regulations stipulate for, none at all need be em-
ployed for some other time. If the regulations
provide that two men shall be employed on a 40-
acre lease—the usual thing hitherto —then, sup-
posing eight men are employed for six months,
nobody at all need be employed for the next
three months. Exemptions can also be got
when, owing to the low price of metal, the
mine cannot pay dividends. The Sydney Tele-
graph and other papers say that this is based on
“equity and expediency,” and is a great thing for
the legitimate miner. As a matter of fact, the
Bill might just as well be without labor conditions
at all. A mining lease is unlike almost any other
kind of lease. For ss. an acre a year the lessee
gets not only the use of the land, but the right to
dig up and cart away all that is in most cases of
any value in it. The rental is practically no con-
sideration whatever. It only obscures the real
consideration, and it might be a very good
thing if, on that account, it were abolished
altogether. The real consideration —the employ-
ment of labor —could then be more plainly
seen. The mining lessee gets the land, and
the right to dig up the minerals and cart
them away, on the express condition that he
employs a certain amount of labor. Because he
undertakes to do that the State treats him as no
private landlord would dream of treating him.
The private landlord wants a royalty ; running up
in some cases to 50 per cent, of the output. The
State, except in the rarest of cases, waives all
right to royalty, even from such a co. as the
Broken Hill Proprietary under its present lease,
and it does all that on the one condition that work
shall be provided for its people. In almost every
newspaper discussion of this matter the awful
hardship of having to employ men at unprofitable
work is dwelt upon, and the public is told that the
industry is hampered because, if this labor condi-
tion isn’t complied with, the lease is liable to for-
feiture. Nothing is said about the enormous con-
cession that the State makes. If the lessees are
not to give employment, what do they give
in 'return for the right to root out
the minerals ? The Broken Hill Proprietary
Co. has in 20 years paid £7,984,000 in
dividends. The State has not drawn one penny
of royalty on that. Is that concession valueless ?
Is the State to get nothing in return ? Admittedly
it may be unpleasant sometimes for a lessee to
have to work his lease. But that is part of the
bargain. It is part of every bargain that the
buyer pays, and paying never is pleasant. The
people who want to smash the labor conditions
say, however, that it really can t matter to labor
whether it is employed a lot at once, or a little all
the time. It does matter a great deal. The curse
of mine-employment under the best of conditions
is its irregularity. There is so little certainty of
employment that most mining towns are mere
camps; the people have no comfort; in many
cases they have no civilisation to speak of. The
new Mining Bill would make this abominable
condition worse.' It would make it easier, too,
for the lessee to squeeze down the miner’s wage.
If it is a question of shutting down and clearing
out, or taking a wage just high enough to allow
him and his family to live miserably, he will take
the starvation wage rather than break up his
home and become a wanderer —and most times
the wage will stay just there. Hitherto, if a
lessee has had a particularly hard stroke of luck,
the law has given the Minister power to grant
suspension of labor conditions ; and, except that
the proceedings ought to be more public, no
further provision is required. The proposal that
a mine should work when metals are booming,
and should be entitled to knock off, and disor-
ganise the labor market, and ruin every mining
town, when the markets are slack, is particularly
outrageous. If the lessee can’t put aside some of
his boom profits to tide over the slack time, then
the sooner he is cleared out to make room for a
lessee who will, the better. If he hasn’t made
any boom profits, then it ought to rest with the
Warden to decide whether there are circumstances
which justify a suspension. Of course, this means
“ insecurity of tenure.” And so it should. All
conditional-lease tenure is insecure ; if it weren’t,
there would be no sense in making the conditions.
But it is the best of tenures so long as the condi-
tions are complied with.
♦
A Champion of Dirt.
Livingstone, member for South Gippsland in
Vic. Assembly, established an unenviable record
as a champion of Dirt, during the passage of the
Milk Supervision Bill. In this Bill Minister
Swinburne made a great effort to clean the
dairyman, and a little knot of country members,
led - by Livingstone, made just as great an
effort to keep him dirty. The action of Living-
stone is incomprehensible. Either he doesn’t
know dirt, even when he sees it on his hands, or
else he doesn’t know that milk and butter are
used as human food. A third possible solution
of his attitude is that he believes a certain
amount of dirt to be good for the consumer. At any
rate, every clause that tended to make the dairy-
man clean was bitterly opposed. Clause 15
prohibited the sale of milk from diseased cows,
and contained a provision allowing the Govern-
ment supervisor to brand such cows, the prohi-
bition to last, if necessary, six weeks. Living-
stone has evidently cultivated a taste for tuber-
culous milk, and “lumpy jaw” is plainly an
old friend of his, for he fought this clause
fiercely, and actually got the prohibition period
reduced to two weeks. Encouraged by this, he
tried hard to get the branding provision knocked
out altogether; but a gleam of common sense
struck the House, and his amendment was nega-
tived. Clause 17 gave the supervisor power to
find out whether a cow was diseased, “or in such
a condition as to be likely to yield unwholesome
milk,” and Livingstone the Dirt-champion moved
that the last clause be omitted. Once again the
House threw out his amendment; but the apostle
of filth was irrepressible, and had a tilt at clause
21, which prohibits diseased persons handling
milk. He thought this was “too drastic,” and
after some tearful pleading the Minister promised
to reconsider it. Clause 23 defines the acts the
supervisor may perform on a dairy, and once
again Livingstone cursed the clause as “ too
drastic.” He objected to a dairy being condemned
because of impure and unwholesome water —what
on earth has Livingstone been reared on ?—and at
last coaxed the House to excise “impure” and
retain “unwholesome.” As it happens, both
words mean much the same thing, but “ unwhole-
some ” will leave a loophole for the tricky
farmer. Evidently either milk or water has
to be very dirty before it is “ unwhole-
some ” to the Livingstone style of person.
Clause 30 prohibited the sale or storage of
adulterated milk, and Livingstone moved
that milk sold on a butter-fat basis be ex-
empted from the operation of the clause.
Worse still, the Minister “promised to consider
the matter.” Then Livingstone went home
satisfied that the great principle of Dirt had been
vindicated, and that the cause of Filth had
triumphed. It would be a small and unimportant
matter if the Dirt dropped on LIVINGST9NE and
his supporters, but the trouble is that it drops
into the millt-pail and gets mixed up with the
butter, for which the dairyman takes the public s
honest money.

A Bishop on Asiatics.
Bishop White—The Bulletin doesn’t know
where he is bishop of, but that is a matter of no
importance —broke out before the Anglican feynod
the other day, on behalf of the cheap nigger whom
the Church loves so dearly, and induced it to affirm
that “ colored nations who are advancing in culture
and civilisation are entitled to a measure of respect
similar to that which is presumably enjoyed by a
white nation; and with regard to the less advanced
races, it is a Christian duty to afford them such
protection and education as is due from tlie elder
to the younger brethren in the great human family
of God.” In support of this view, Bishop White
argued thus (daily paper report)
His motion was no attack upon a White Australia ; it
only pleaded for a removal of a color hatred and
a color prejudice. He believed to a large extent
in a White Australia; a White Australia founded
on justice, brotherly love, and high aims—not on preju-
dice, injustice, and selfish isolation. Nationality was a
distinction given to most people of the earth, and the
superiority of a people was not due merely to a question
of color. If examples were needed of this, might he call
attention to the Huns, a Mongolian race, who nearly con-
quered Europe ; to the Turks, who occupied part of it,
and who were considered among the best soldiers in the
world: to the Sikhs, and other colored races, whose
bravery had made them remarkable. In civilisation the
Eastern races were the equal, if not the superior, of the
Western ; in architecture the East had buildings as grand
as any in the West; it had triumphed in art, while writing
and arithmetic had been given us by its people. As to
thought and intellectuality all the great religions of the
world had come from the East, while from Japan the
world received an example of patriotism, fortitude, skill,
and courtesy.
This sort of thing arouses a lot of conflicting emo-
tions. Here we have a bishop who deliberately
quotes the Huns—the most brutish invaders who
ever desolated Europe, the race of beardless, flat-
nosed deformities whose manners caused them to
be set down as the descendants of bcythian
witches who married evil spirits—as a proof of
Asiatic superiority. His other proof is the lurks
—the race whose Bulgarian atrocities and Ar-
menian massacres, whose sloth, cruelty, incapacity
and misgovernment have made the finest part of
Europe a chaos and an ante-chamber of perdition.
Leaving the Huns and Turks out of the question,
however, we come to the fact that Bishop White
holds up Asiatics as “ equal if not superior 111
civilisation to Europeans. This is startling, but
it may be true. Assuming that it is true, why
should Australia be Christian any longer, and
especially why should it further support Bishop
White ? According to that gentleman Asia knows
as much as Europe —perhaps more. The Bishop
represents and lives by a religion which
certainly originated in Asia, but which Asia
has almost unanimously repudiated as a false
creed. Whatever hold Christianity retains
upon Asia it retains mainly because the
Christian doctrine is held up by European
bayonets. After his statement about the
superiority of Asia it is certainly advisable to stop
paying Bishop White’s salary until we have asked
Asia’s opinion as to whether he is, in a religious
sense, a blatant impostor or not. Likewise (con-
sidering the alleged mental equality or superiority
of Asia) it is a fair thing to cease supporting
missions to that country until we are sure that we
are not in the position of ignorant young
people trying to teach our Asiatic grand-
mother how to extract nourishment from the
output of the hen. We might even turn
Buddhists in a temporary way, pending develop-
ments. Furthermore, seeing that the Asiatic is our
equal, if not our superior, it is plainly “up to
the British Government to retire out of India and
not further insult a highly improved people by
bringing the crude ideas of undeveloped Europe
into their land. The attitude of the British
people in India, where they pose as a superior
and conquering race, is plainly an insult and a
shameful wrong; and if the Bishop doesn’t say so
the omission can only Vie sot down to the church s
tendency to grovel to established authority and to
be a door-mat for people in power. As to admit-
ting the Asiatic into Australia, it will be time to
consider that point when the British- people in
India recognise him as an equal and treat him as
such. His first right is to fully possess Ins own
country ; the question of possessing or partially

Why the Vic. Railways Didn’t Pay.
A MAN who believes in Tait sends this:
The old boomtime management of the Victorian
railways, which David Symk, the Age boss, denounced
at a cost of much ink and treasure, and the Argus
defended with the enthusiastic affection it has ever
shown for abuses, standi now utterly condemned in the
light of Commissioner Tait’s results.
The ousting of poor qjd Dick Speight, the genial bon
vivant, was not followed by anything startling in railway
reforms. All that was done might as well have been done
by him, it seemed. Then Mathieson came along and
took over the attempt to square the ledger, and still
there was nothing in particular to prove the
alleged absurd extravagance of Speight s bygone
traffic management. A good season brought in-
creased receipts without a satisfactory improvement
in profits. It remained for Tait, the man from Canada,
to work economies, not so much by retrenchment in the
cost of labor employed as in the handling of the traffic on
hard commercial principles. Two bounteous harvests in
succession gave the new Commissioner his opportunity
to effect all-round reforms in the old system of carrying
the stuff. The traffic was more closely watched in detail,
and the average load per goods train rose to a height of
remunerativeness hitherto unattained. Things Werdmade

to “ fit in ” for the benefit of the department. It was on
a good wicket, and it scored freely, forcing- the profits
instead of playing a lazy game. The same traffic might
have been much less productively handled, and the
department would have got credit for making economies,
nevertheless. Commissioner Tait has undoubtedly shat-
tered the lingering suspicion that Speight, deceased, was
not half so extravagant as the Age painted him. A lot of
unpayable lines were thrust upon thirsty Dick, and he
couldn t practise serious economies in their working ; but
the possible things which he ought to have done, and
never did, are now as obvious as Bent’s waistcoat.
Look back to that wild boom-time when everybody had
money to spend. Melbourne people are amazed to remem-
her that the railwa3 7 s then offered no special incentives
to travel. Speight never encouraged his officers
lu Wu excursion trade. Victorians in general, and
the Melbourne crowd in particular, boomed and busted
without knowing that the country possessed many of the
beauty spots which even then were accessible. The
management of the Department lacked the showman
spirit of enterprise at the time when most money was
being spent in pleasure-seeking, and it is only within the
past year or two that Boyce— brisk Boyce of the Inquiry
Office—has, at the instance of Secretary Maclellan, been
appointed excursion agent, and the little building
by Princes Bridge, where he reels off facts and
figures to inquirers, has become a medium for
illuminated advts. From November until April views of
the tourist resorts of Victoria are displayed by lantern
slides over the Inquiry Office. Interspersed with these
pictures are slides announcing cheap Sunday trains and
the fares thereof, seaside excursions, mountain district,
lakes district, and suburban seaside trains, rail-cum-coach
trips, and ordinary week-end excursions. The passing
crowd is appealed to with a number of cinematograph
pictures of the Gembrook and YVarburton lines, taken from
trains in action. Port Fairy is advertised with moving
pictures of the local fishing fleet, and Geelong bursts into
notice as a busy port for grain and wool ships, which it
sometimes is. And there are “ funny ” pictures—a free,
frivolous entertainment intended to popularise the show
and increase the nightly attendance of gazers.
The Vic. Railway Department bids for custom by up-to-
date devices. It is so far advanced that one of the advt.
bills lately issued has brought a blush to the cheek of
local shopkeepers, for whereas intending visitors to the
Victorian Alps are advised to take their own skates with
them, they find, on inquiry, that the Melbourne iron-
mongers have no skates in stock thusfar. The “ trade ”
didn’t know of any sheets of ice or hard snow-tracks in
the State until the Railway Department exhorted the
public to go forth and inspect the frozen regions.
Concerning the Sydney gentleman who recently
lectured on land settlement:—
Now that the class to which Reginald Black belongs
has succeeded in getting all the “ possible ” land
into its own hands, it has the gall to pose as
the apostle of closer settlement, and invites the
landless to take up the land that isn’t here. When
the central leases expired it was the same Reginald
Black, backed up by the übiquitous John Plummer,
who flooded the country and metropolitan press with
letters pointing out that the leases ought to be renewed,
as there was no legitimate demand for land. No selector
was ever “ legitimate ”in their eyes. “ Wingen ” Abbott,
another newly-arrived advooate for closer settlement,
even suggested, in a letter to the Daily Telegraph, that
the whole of the central division leases, as they expired
should be withdrawn from all forms of conditional
purchase and sold outright; unsold portion, of course, to
be tacked on to the squatter’s leases. Mr. Black frankly
explains now how his clan secured their big estates by
peacocking ” and the use of dying men from the hospi-
tals and benevolent asylums as dummies. In defence, of
course, against “blackmailers”— i.e., selectors.
. “ Supposing,” says Mr. Blaok, indignantly, “ a man who
is renting a residence comes down to breakfast and finds
a man in his dining-room, and when asked ‘ What right
had he to be there?’ the resident is told, ‘Oh, I have
selected this room; the law allows me to take it
and keep it.’ Wbat would be your feelings?” This is
advanced as an analogous case to the position the lessees
were in with regard to selectors. It may pass with city
people, but if Reginald had put it honestly the “resi-
dent’’would have been called the “caretaker,” whom
the State agreed to allow the use of the house
it obtained _ a more profitable tenant. It
wasn’t his house in any case. The squatter knew
he was only in possession on sufferance. He knew
that the infinitesimal rent he paid was based on the
insecurity of his tenure, and that he was liable to be
evicted on any Thursday morning by a selector who
would have to pay twenty times the rent he was
paying ; in fact, in a great many cases, what the
squatter paid wasn’t even called rent ; it was called
license fee—a mere license to occupy. Reginald
had better let sleeping dogs lie on the subject of
lessees and selectors, for all his ingenious arguments
that the Sydney Telegraph made such a splurge about,
can be knocked kite-high by any intelligent selector who
has been through the mill. The position now is that the
land-grabbers, having secured all the pick of the country,
see that only two courses are open to a Government
desirous of fostering closer settlement—a stiff progressive
land-tax, with a double tax on absentees, or the repur-
chase, at the landlords’ own figure, of the lands that were
sold for an old song in times past. Naturally they prefer
the latter. One of these methods must be taken. Which
is it to be ?
On a recent Monday, Sydney Evening News pub-
lished a leading article steeped in profound gloom
about the hopelessness of finding work for immi-
grants in Australia—empty Australia. About the
blackest slab of melancholy which waved its
hearse-plume on the subject was this :
All these gentlemen, and many others engaged in the
profession of politics, seem to altogether lose sight of
one of the most important issues connected with the im-
migration question, and that is the matter of finding pre-
liminary employment for the newcomers. If there is a
strong demand for labor in their respective States, then,
so long as the immigrants have health and strength, they
will soon be disposed of, to be placed on the land later,
and when they have acquired some amount of experience.
If our own pastoral and agricultural industries here in
New South Wales were capable of absorbing 5000
men, that number might be profitably imported
to-morrow. Five hundred would, however, probablv far
more than swamp the whole Australian market. There
is, it is to be feared, no work in this country for the
British pauper. Therefore, if we cannot get any other
class, it seems clear that we must either put him on what
land we can find and pay him to stay there ; make em-
ployment for him on public works instituted for hi*
benefit, or do without him altogether.
And in a whole column and a half of dirge and
confessed failure it wasn’t once mentioned that
Australia imports annually some £30,000,000 worth
of goods that it could easily make itself ; that if
these imports were shut out we would have to
make the things ourselves; and that if we made
them there would be work enough, in these manu-
factures alone, to support our own people and
600,000 British paupers—provided they were
healthy intelligent paupers with nothing against
them save their poverty.

People who possess the idea that the Law regards
the rich and the poor man with equal eye, and is
equally available to both, may learn a little wis-
dom from an application made to J ustice a’Beckett
in Melbourne lately. The trouble arose over
what is known as the “heiress” case, in which
Robertson and Moffat sued one Belson for
£ll2 for goods delivered, while Belson counter-
claimed £664. A verdict was given for Belson
on the claim, and on the counter-claim he got
£222, which the Full Court afterwards reduced to
£9B. For the privilege of losing that £9B, and
its own claim as well, the plaintiff firm was
invited to pay a bill of costs totalling £lO3O. This
the taxing-master reduced to £436, whereupon
another expensive barrister appealed to his Honor
to have compassion on thesharksand restore the bill
to its original bulgy condition. Some of the items
were interesting. Instructions for brief were put
down at £4OO and reduced to £75. Barrister Purves’
brief was marked at 40 guineas and his junior’s at
20 ) the taxing-master cut them down to 25 and 15
guineas. “ Term fees,” an item that appeared to
be wrapped in mystery, but was understood to be
a sort of general payment to cover little incidental
things such as postages, was hacked down from
£6 to a paltry 15s. The shark nearly wept as he
narrated this infamy. Then he proceeded to tell
piteously how Purves’ Full Court appeal brief,
marked at 20 guineas, had been reduced to a
wretched 10 guineas—for about an hour’s work.
But here barrister Bryant interposed that
barrister Purves merely opened his mouth once
for the money, and that was when he told Bryant
to sit down, which Bryant didn’t do. Finally
a’Beckett dismissed the appeal with £5 ss. costs.
Always more costs.
Judge Molesworth of Victoria, while recently
considering a case under the Immigration Restric-
tion Act, was an angry horsehair because the
Chow who was under discussion had been barred
out for failing to write out an English sentence
which, said his Honor, “thousands of persons in
the British Isles could not write.” And his Honor
was quite correct in his facts ; thousands of people
in the British Isles couldn’t write it. But what has
that to do with the case, and why will Judges
persist in the hypocrisy of pretending to believe
that the Asiatic who is barred out for failure to
pass the education test is barred out because of
his want of education ? He was meant to fail or
the test wouldn’t have been put. It was put
because he was regarded as an undesirable, and it
isn’t put to persons coming from the British
Isles because they are not regarded as undesir-
ables. When a really undesirable immigrant
comes this way, the handiest method to make sure
that he won’t get in is to set him an education
test that nobody in the British Isles could pass and
which would stump Judge Molesworth himself
if he ran against it. Of course it is a dishonest
and underhand way of keeping out the undesirable,
but it was the only way we could get. The under-
hand Chamberlain informed us that any open,
honest, above-board exclusion of objectionable
Asiatics would not be allowed ; and as he had the
tortuous British Government, and the circuitous
British Parliament, and the subterranean Edward
VII behind him, we had to give way. The process
whereby we keep out Asiatics is British fair-play
as defined by the British Government. If Judge
Molesworth has anything bad to say about it, he
had better write to Edward VII and tell that
monarch frankly what he thinks of him.
General Booth explains his withdrawal from
the Australian immigration business thus:—
Canada wants workers, but Australia is hampered by
an industrial Labor party.
Booth proposed sending out men to settle on the
land, but when the States took stock of their re-
sources, Tasmania found that its big landlords
and its V.D.L. Co, had the land, and it couldn’t
even find soil for its own people. Victoria found
that though its fertile Western District is almost
empty, and there are howling wildernesses of grass
right alongside Melbourne, the Manifolds,
Chtrnsides, &c., possess it all. N.S.W. dis-
covered that the Peel River estate and the A. A.
Co.’s estate, and the Bibbenluke estate, and the
like, absorb its best ground, and it has nothing
to offer but the Pilliga scrub out on the waterless
rim of Sheol. But the Labor party gets the
blame as usual—just as if Percy Chirnside
and Manifold were pick and shovel men,
and the A. A. Co. a mere corporation laborer.
When is Labor going to hit back by
putting up a really good fight for the breaking up
of all these big estates with a remorseless Federal
graduated land-tax? By doing that, it could
make room for the Australian who wants land,
and for hundreds of thousands of imniigrants as
well; also it could clear its own reputation and
get level with its worst enemies—all in one act.

W. J. Sowden, of the Tory Register (Adelaide),
has lately been drifting through the United States,
and one virulent Stinking Fish interview with
him appears in the press thus :
We have had a sad experience with Government owner-
ship. Nearly all of our public utilities are administered
by the Government, with the result that politics dominate
them, and the public service is woefully misadministered.
Not all of the tramways are in the hands of the Govern-
ment, but with the slovenly example of the Government
railroads and Government tramways to copy, we find our-
selves in a sad way. To begin with, the service is con-
trolled by the Premiers of the various provinces, who
represent the dominant political parties, and run the rail-
roads largely as personal and political properties. The
roads do not pay properly, the tariffs on passengers
and goods are high compared with yours, and the
employees, having life posts, are not amenable to discipline
or to public sentiment. The eight-hour day is in force
everywhere. What is true of the Government roads is
true of the Government telephone and telegraph lines,
which are not managed with the efficiency and economy
of your private corporations. I notice, too, that our
Government institutions require more employees than
your private enterprises. There is no question that
wasteful and extravagant practices obtain.
When this surprising tale got into print it looked
so awful that a terrified Sowden sent along his
assurance that what he said in a “casual chat”
had been greatly enlarged upon and misrepre-
sented. Perhaps so. But if Sowden had
casually chatted the solid truth it is difficult
to see where the reporter could have got the
basis for the above. A great many gentle-
men of the Fish persuasion are quite surprised
afterwards when they realise how many unreliable
things they said in one casual chat. The idea,
for instance, of setting down the slow, dirty and
unprofitable private enterprise horse-trams of
Adelaide as an evil result brought about by copy-
ing the splendid State-owned trams of Sydney—
about the best tramway service on earth so far as
speed and comfort are concerned—is a striking
example of how a Tory gentleman may contrive
to get himself misunderstood in the course of a mere
“chat.” Such men as Sowden should never chat;
they should converse ponderously. When they
try to frisk lightly in the flowery groves of conver-
sation they get themselves as badly misunderstood
as an elephant does in a polka.

It should be something gained to have an
Australian drama ; but that still leaves the ques-
tion open whether it is better to have no Austra-
lian drama at all or one whose hero is a thief.
Call him a bushranger, but “Thunderbolt”
remains just an open-air thief, in spite of his
knee-breeches, his horsemanship, and all that.
It is useless to say, in defence, that Thunderbolt—
the idealised Thunderbolt of Ambrose Pratt and
A. S. Joseph’s drama, anyway—only robbed the
rich. He only robbed the rich because they were
the only people worth robbing. If the poor had
had plenty of money, he would have robbed
them also, but the poor never have. And Thunder-
bolt is a thief who, so far as this drama
is concerned, goes absolutely unpunished.
His virtues (which consist largely of liberality
with other people’s money) are painted a beautiful
white, his crimes are excused and palliated, and
the police are held up to ridicule. The imported
melodrama, vile as it often is in some respects, is
at any rate solid on one point—virtue is trium-
phant by 11 o’clock, and vice is foiled in the fourth
act, or else the sixth. No doubt this isn’t true to
nature, because vice pretty often is having a line
time at 11 p.m., while supperless virtue is sitting
up in the cold at home trying to put the hungry,
sick baby to sleep. But does melodrama ever pre-
tend to be true to nature —melodrama with its absurd
“comic relief,’’and so on? And, anyhow, is it doing
the fair thingby nature to leave the tale half-told ?
The authors of “ Thunderbolt ” dare not carry
their hero to his logical conclusion. They dare not
show him triumphant; and they dare not show
him where the villain usually is in melodrama at
this stage of the proceedings. At 10.55 they there-
fore send him galloping off (on a thoroughbred, of
course), and just let him disappear in the distance.
* * * *
Of course, this is taking the matter very
seriously. There are, no doubt, other ways of
looking at it —as a mere piece of entertainment,
to be forgotten in the rush for the train ; or as a
piece of literary work. If they issue pass-out
ALFRED DAMPIER.
checks at the place where Thunderbolt is evidently
playing a golden harp, and he looked in at Sydney
Royal to hear his virtues praised, he found a
crowded house—cold, wet feet covering the floor,
and damp umbrellas dripping under the seats!
Yet, damped down though it was, the house
most obviously liked it. No howling London
melodrama of the last two Anderson seasons
has been better received. As a piece of
entertainment it answered its purpose. The
Andersonian audience wants plenty of action,
and “Thunderbolt” supplies that. It wants a
strong love interest, and “Thunderbolt” is in
that business also. For the latter purpose an old
stock-in-trade, not distinguishable from the im-
ported stuff has been got in. There is
squatter Mason—talking just as though he were
squire Mason—rich, with the usual young fool of
a drunken son ; the usual heroic sister ; a wicked
bank manager who wants the old man’s station,
and uses the son’s forged cheque as a means to
force the daughter into marriage. Thunderbolt is
the means by which the villainy is thwarted, and
the young woman gets the other young man
whom she wants, though, so far as the play is
concerned, the other young man doesn’t do any-
thing to deserve Miss Duggan. In the course of
his philanthropic labors in the interests of true
love Thunderbolt sticks up a couple of coaches and
a bush pub., goes through the “comic relief”
three times, fights a duel with Morgan who is also
in the bushranging business, drinks half a pint of
beer, knocks senior-constable O’Malley out in one
round, does some desperate steeplechasing, and
finds time to kiss his best girl, Sunday Maguire, 15
times. You get an evening of Thunderbolt with
an interesting and reasonably sober plot thrown
in, and a menagerie of wallabies, kookaburras,
mail coaches, and cockatoos to add more local
color to Reg Robins’ New England (N.S.W.)
scenery. Special mention deserves to be _ made
of the bush pub—the exterior, not the interior.
'** * *
Laurence Dunbar is a rather prosy Thun-
derbolt. Miss Duggan plays the girl whom the
villain from the bank wants to marry. Miss
Guildford is Thunderbolt’s best girl. George
Cross is the squatter’s fool of a son; Bert Bailey,
the usual impossible jackeroo; Stirling Whyte, the
heavy father. The performance reaches a fair and
generally uniform level. The only, person who
doesn’t act up to his reputation is the kooka-
burra ; it isn’t his night for making any remarks.
And when one comes to think of it, that is per-
haps just as well. It has taken less than a
kookaburra’s laugh to spoil a first night, and send
even a more deserving play into the ash bin.

There was no hesitancy in the cheering
which greeted Miss Tittell Brune on her re-ap-
pearance before the Sydney public at Her
Majesty’s last Saturday. A quite enthusiastic
reception by a crowded house showed that she
had been well remembered. And Rostand’s
poetiq&l NapoU'oaSc dvama, “ L’Aiglon,” was,
strnao V enough, received with alums* equal
warmth —strangely the production was
only a revival and “ L’Aiglon ” has before
this exploited the attractions of novelty; be-
cause it is not so much a drama of
coherent interest, as a character sketch of a per-
sonality ; and because the national interest seems,
at first view, French only. But the enthusiasm
for “L’Aiglon” w as seal, and was the reflex of a real
sentiment. Napoleon hGungs to the world, not
to France alone. He stands—despot as he was—
the incarnation of democracy for all races and all
times. The king power and the priest power,
which had been strangling Europe tor centuries,
he destroyed, showing that “Divine Right ’’was a
poorer title to a throne than Napoleonic might,
and setting up his stable-boys and scullions as
kings. True, in his decadence, besought to build
a new kingship on the ruins of the old, but could
never undo his own work, which made the French
Republic possible, which made British democracy
possible, which guarded the infant days of the
American Republic, and to an extent shaped the
destinies even of Australia. That is the secret of
the persistence of the Napoleonic tradition, the
explanation of a Sydney audience in the 20th
century taking a passionate interest in a Napo-
leonic play, which is sad and gloomy in tone,
jerky and episodic in treatment, and great only in
its characterisation and its poetic language.
* * * *
As L’Aiglon, Miss Brune has a part which
is rich in dramatic possibilities, and she makes
full use of them. Her interpretation is, perhaps,
a little too feverish, accentuates too much the
hysterical side of the young Napoleon’s nature,
and would be better for more wistfulness and less
declamation ; but to all the big scenes she gives
the air of tragic reality. In the allotment of the
subordinate —as a rule, very subordinate —charac-
ters there has been some slight change since the
play was last produced in Sydney. Miss Susie
Vaughan, well remembered as a member of the
Brough-Boucieault co., now plays the widow of
Napoleon. But Messrs. Hod grave (Flambeau the
veteran) and Gran (the Emperor of Austria) have
a chance to repeat former successes. The only
other figure to stand out from the crowded court
is Metternich (Mr. Atllolwood), but all the minor
parts are capably filled. Next Saturday “Camille”
will be staged.
** * *
The ever-welcome Alfred Dampier and his
co. re-appeared at Sydney Criterion on Saturday
night before an audience that left no doubt of its
feelings towards the re-visitors. “The Bush
King,” in which the co. opened, is an old friend
of ours. But it is an old friend much improved
in figure—it has been pruned and shaved and
polished, brushed up, curled and seasoned by travel,
to say nothing of scissors and ink. The wicked
nephew has not reformed, nor has the kind, gulli-
ble old uncle any more common sense to take
with him to the untimely grave to which the
nephew sends him. But the wickedness and
gullibleness are now more probable, and the melo-
drama leaps like a kangaroo or glides like a snake
along bush tracks or open roads, through bush
grog shanties and through squatters’ homesteads.
Always the man is after the woman, and the
troopers after the man, and the mills of God
creak obviously as they get ready to grind the
Wicked. The act “tags” tell the story of love
and bushranging and amazing horsemanship;
“ A Bush Track ” ; “A Flat and Two Sharps ” ;
“ Why should she ruin my life ? I’ll ruin hers as
she has ruined mine”; “The Eyes Behind the
Tree”; “The Police Attack”; “The Leap for
Life ” ; “ I’ll speak the truth and hang them
both”; “A Devilish Device”; “The Little
Church by the Blue Lake”; “Marriage and
Happiness ever after ” —in these brief yelps the
bill tells the tale.
* * * *
Alfred Dampier hasn’t an exacting part as
Ned Harling the bushman—intemperate, and
insanitary-looking—but he plays, as he always
does, splendidly, and his resonant, melodious
voice remains unaltered through the altering
years. Edmund Holloway makes a loveable,
irascible, gouty old squatter. This squatter must
have been an absentee of many years’ sitting;
also he must have had conservative ancestors, to
have inherited such a truly English brand of
gout. Alfred Rolfe, in the dual characters of the
good Edgar Dalmore and the bushranger, Captain
Midnight, is a very mild bailer-up, but a veryfgood
lover and horseman. Miss Lily Dampier, as the
unsteady Ned’s daughter, is the sleekest, neatest,
and toniest bush girl The Bulletin has ever
encountered in such out-back surroundings. Miss
C. Doyle appears as the good Edgar’s good sweet-
heart, and Alf. Dampier, junr., as Ginger Joe, is
the really humorous character of the melodrama.

The double bill introduced at Melbourne
Princess’s last Saturday didn’t promise to be
more popular than a number of previous double
bills. Australia, as a rule, would rather get its
theatrical entertainment in one piece, and if it
must have two pieces it likes them to be interest-
ingly contrasted. In this case the management
puts up a curtain-raiser which has the same fancy-
dress appearance, and the same sort of artificial
effect as the afterpiece. The heroine of one
and the hero of the other are mummers who
carry their mummery into private life with a
self-sacrificing motive. Their audiences on the
stage are understood to be misled by their deceit-
ful tactics, but the people in front of the foot-
lights know all about the plot and are overdosed
with mock histrionics before 11 p.m. There is too
much pretence of acting off the boards by actors
on the boards. And there have been other plays
at the Princess’s—a number of them —in which
the chief performer played the character of a
noble-minded mummer. One wearies of such per-
sistent glorification of “ the Purfesh.”

“ Comedy and Tragedy ” is one of W. S.
Gilbert’s early efforts in dramatic work, and is
Gilbertian only in a few lines of dialogue, and a
whimsical turn given to the tragic ending. A
giddy Due D’Orleans, whose legs and morals are
equally graceless, has designs on the virtue of a
married actress. Her husband, being a mere
person in the same line of business, can’t persuade
the noble Due to duel with him. His challenges
trickle like water off the Due’s back. So the
husband and wife lay a trap for the amorous
profligate. The lad.y induces his Nibs to make
some more love, in order that her husband
may find them together and insist upon a duel.
Whilst the two principal men are fighting behind
the scenes the lady undertakes the awful task of
keeping several other men amused with her
impromptu comedy acting, until at last she thinks
her husband has been fatally stuck, and she tells
the truth to the company, whereupon the company
applauds her for acting very emotionally. Then
the husband comes to tell her it was the Due
who got a rapier through his body, and
the lady smilingly protests that this is the
little surprise she had been preparing for
her friends. Meanwhile the Due is said to
be dying, but nobody worries about him. His
decease counts as an unexpected joke. Miss
Maud Jeffries shines majestically in her discourse
with the bamboozled nobleman, and in her display
of honest emotion what time she thinks she is
about to become a widow ; but her attempt to
witch the society critics with comedy acting is so
poor that their attitude of admiration looks rather
absurd. They are absurd people altogether.
Plimmer is a tall, unbending husband, and Wont-
ner a fairly successful Due, from the knees up-
wards.

“Davy Garrick” is a play wherein Julius
Knight sports crimson velvet and fine trim-
mings. There is a girl in it, and an
alderman, and Davy Garrick. A scene in
which the silly old alderman bestows a parental
curse upon his crushed Violet because she has
chased Garrick to his domicile is the cheapest
kind of melodrama ; moreover, G. P. Carey made
it farcical on Saturday by muddling his words. The
brightest feature of an unconvincing performance
was Miss Unie Russell as Violet Gresham. Her
mannerisms of studied “niceness” were relaxed
when she warmed to the part, and in the second
act she gave touches of reality to the situations
and carried the sympathy of the audience witli
her. Julius Knight, on the other hand, was too
melodramatic as soon as he ceased to smile. For
the rest, the two comic ladies were satisfactory,
and Arthur Wontner did his best in an unsuitable
character. The same bill runs six nights. The
last week of the season starts on Saturday with
“ The Silver King.”

Any Melbourne citizens who have hitherto
refrained from witnessing “The Cingalee” will
need to get there before Saturday if they mean
business. Ohambhuddy Ram and his accomplices
are booked for a brief revival of “The Orchid,”
and instead of chasing a worthless birthmark the
company will seek the costly vegetable which
transpires in Caroline’s capacious headgear.

Bland Holt’s revival of “A Sailor’s Knot,”
at Melbourne Royal, will clothe an unworthy
narrative in pleasing garments and call respectful
attention to Brunton’s scenery for a fortnight.
The “Knot” dates the co. back to the time of
Bonaparte, when the British tar was largely an
unwilling fighter for the Flag, and the villain
of the piece consigned his male victims to
the press-gang. Also it is remarkable for
the absence of Miss Harrie Ireland and
the evil conduct of Charles Brown, usually a
harmless, cheerful person in melodrama. The
cheerfulness is divided in about equal parts
between Bland, as art irresponsible young water-
man, and Mrs. Holt, as his trim-built wherry.
As far as the scenery will permit, the bulk Of the
drama tries to be serious, but the sorrows of the
good young man are temporarily suspended whilst
Britannia, the Pride of the Ocean, comes along
and delivers an address concerning four tableaux,
like a descriptive fairy in Xmas panto. Bri-
tannia, minus her shield and trident, is imper-
sonated by Miss Pollock.

“Everyman,” the quaint old Christianity
play, will point its moral at the congregation in
Melbourne Town Hall next Thursday afternoon
(26th), and again on Derby night, a time when
deluded speculators have mostly lost all faith in
“ morals.” Julius Knight undertakes the name-
part as before, but the gentleman who imper-
sonated the Almighty on previous occasions will
be invisible next week, and a Voice alone will indi-
cate that One greater than even the Governor-
General is opening the proceedings.

J. C. Williamson’s Bio-Tableau is just now
supplying a want at the Athenaeum Hall. The
pictures have been gathered from sundry places,
and the subjects are as various as the views of a
mixed gathering at a football match. In fact, the
Bio-Tableau leaves nothing much to be desired,
except a severe toning-down of the noises intended
to let the public hear what they are looking at.
The accompaniment is so tumultuously performed
that at times the whirring of the apparatus in the
balcony is but a small circumstance —a mere drop
in the ocean of din.

Melbourne for a while will have three rival
shows in the Prince’s Bridge district. Prince’s
Court last week added an animated war spectacle
to its stock-in-trade. Wirths’ Circus, and the
“herd” of elephants, and all the roaring things
that announce themselves from Wirths’ posters,
will inaugurate a season of unparalleled excite-
ment on Saturday night, when the Dauntless
Demon of the Death Trap will dodge his doom
under special engagement. Another circus, di-
rected by Eroni Brothers, promises to blow its
brass instruments and wave its banners at Fitz-
geralds’ Building, in bold defiance of Wirths’.
Circuses, seemingly, thrive on a policy of warfare,
following one another from place to place and
Eainting the hoardings red. All of them are run
y Brothers, which shows the warmth of their
mutual affection.
An obituary b *“E.F.”T—
Although the fame of Henry Irving is not 35 years old,
it is seemingly impossible to find a correct sketch of flis
career in a newspaper or magazine. The ordinary story
of Irving is a compilation of confused facts and foolish
misstatements. The writers who ought to be correct are
at fault in their memories, whilst the younger generation
writes from hearsay—and hearsay is the worst of his-
torians. Henry Irving was a comparatively young-
actor when he first attracted attention outside of
London. His personality, his magnetic eye, his level
intelligence, and his occasional brilliant flashes of
humor or passion distinguished him from the crowd of
other competent men of his young time—a time of hard,
all-round work for actors and actresses. He was playing
in Byron’s “ Dearer Than Life ” at Manchester, or some-
where, when Charles Dickens—himself an actor by instinct
—remarked to his son that young Irving had a great
future. The Dickens family remembered the prediction
years afterwards, when Irving had become a “ lion,” and
then the eldest son presented him with a silver inkstand
souvenir of the novelist. But Irving was 35 before he
began to be a lion. He had two or three London
successes in comedy parts ere he got a chance as
a star. His Mr. Cheveux, in “ Uncle Dick’s Darling,”
brought him some reputation ; his Digby Grant, in “ The
Two Roses,” strengthened it; but his market price as a
character actor rose no higher than £l5 a week. In 1872,
or thereabouts, Irving struck an engagement that made
his fortune. Bateman, father of “Leah” Bateman, the
stormy tragedienne, was running the Lyceum with very
little capital, and, having a shrewd belief in Irving’s pos-
sibilities, decided to put up “The Bells,” and try what
the rising man could do as the conscience-stricken burgo-
master. Success or failure depended on the actor’s mag-
netic force in the dream scene.
Irving was a success —and he owed it to his managerial
admirer. “The Bells” had been hawked around the
theatres, but nobody else cared to stage the gloomy
piece. Bateman made Irving, and Irving made Bateman.
After a run of 150 nights for “ The Bells,” another hit
was made with “ Charles the First ” ; then came “ Eugene
Aram ” and “ Richelieu,” and other dramas, the mumbling-
mannered actor being handicapped all the time with the
feeble support of Isabel Bateman, the manager’s younger
daughter, as leading lady.
In 1874—at the end of the year—Hamlet” captured
the town and held it for 200 nights. During the long run
of “Hamlet” manager Bateman died, after which his
widow carried on the theatre to the end of the lease and
Irving remained with her, his salary having been raised
to £165 a week, prior to Bateman’s death. But when the
Bateman lease expired Irving’s influential friends secured
the Lyceum for him—old Baroness Burdett-Ooutts was his
chief financier—and he started his great career of lavish
management with Ellen Terry as a co-attraction. His
liberality in salaries and fixings was splendid, and
as grand monarque of the English stage he did
better work than he ever achieved as a mummer.
“ Not a great actor, but a great artist —the greatest
in the world,” said Sarah Bernhardt, when pressed
for an opinion on Irving’s talent. _ Of course,
he was not the cold, ascetic person that his photographs
suggested. All his life he retained his early taste for
Bohemianism, and played the “ good fellow” in his spare
time. The Hamlet of the ’7o’s ate, drank and snuffed
with enthusiasm, stayed out all night with the boys, and
doubtless shortened his life by burning the candle at
both ends. He was 68 when the memorable candle
flickered out.

The excellent Thurston is finishing a second
week at Adelaide Tivoli, to the great satisfaction
of crowded audiences, which leave their reasoning
faculties at home and accept such marvels as are
offered them. Many people appear and disappear
during his two hours’ tenure of the stage, but the
manifestation of a very wet maiden in a trans-
parent and previously empty tank (empty of all
save water) remains the most striking feat. All
other amusements have been dealt a severe blow
by the largest Charity Fete on record, in the
Government House grounds. This, being right in
the heart of the city, has, for three strenuous
days and nights, gathered in all passers-by to the
sound of the brass band. There were concerts all
the time, but everything else in that line paled
before the Variety Show given by society ama-
teurs. They would have drawn a good attendance
even if they had been bad, but they proved unex-
pectedly good, and were rushed twice a day. The
men in this show were nearly all young lawyers,
and they proved themselves as handy with bones
and tambourine as with a bill of costs.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“ J.A.O.": Obit Henry Irving, originally John Henry
Brodribb. He had his stage-name of Irving confirmed by
royal patent, because his sons could not enter Eton
school under pseudonym. He was born at Keinton,
Glastonbury, Somersetshire, in 1838, and educated in
London. He made his first appearance on the stage at
the Sunderland theatre in 1856. I remember him as a
member of a stock company in Scotland. I only met him
once, but saw enough of him to know him for a courteous
gentleman. His first great success was in ’70, at the
Vaudeville Theatre, Strand, London, as Digby Grant, in
the “ Two Roses.” Possibly no actor on the stage had
more mannerisms than he. He had a drawling, cavernous
voice, and a dragging, slouching gait, and on that account
many cavilled at his acting of tragedy, but as a “ char-
acter ” actor he was easily first. I have seen him play
Matthias in “ The Bells,” and Jeremy Diddler in “ Raising
the Wind,” two diametrically opposite parts, in one even-
ing, and he was as good in one as in the other. His stage
management and his conception of the characters he
played were unsurpassed. He was possibly the first actor
who portrayed Shylock as a gentleman, and not as a
pettifogging, “ vant to puy a veskit ” Jew, served up with
a dash of incarnate fiend.
“T.D.”: Had no opportunity of hearing the great
Tamagno, just dead, save by the cheap aid of the Parisian
phonograph shops. But in Paris one gets phonographic
records that go nowhere else. Instead of going into a
hall or shop and hearing the great artist through a trum-
pet arrangement which muffles the voice and makes it
sound like the braying of a brass ass, you buy little metal
discs at twenty centimes each, and drop them into a slot
after fixing the number of the item you want. Then you
put two receivers to your ears and wait, and presently
you have Melba, Tamagno, and the rest singing
almost as brilliantly as though they were in
front of you. Of course, their faults. in sing-
ing are more apparent, as the concentration of the
voice shows up things which are concealed when the
voice spreads through a great hall. For the singing'
student, these phonograph shops, which haven’t yet
extended to London, afford lessons which are invaluable,
as the opportunities for comparison are so many and
varied. For tenpence, I’ve heard the world’s five
greatest tenors in succession, all in the. one item,
so that I have come away with the best points of each
individual rendering firmly impressed on my mind.
Departing disappointed from the opera, I have gone in
and bought twopenn’orth of some great artist in the num-
ber which has disgusted me, and have found content. To
get back to Tamagno, and judging through the Parisian
phonograph, his voice was a magnificent trumpet-toned
organ, hard in quality by comparison with Caruso’s, and
very reminiscent, on a grander scale, of that which Larizza
took with him to Australia four or five years ago. Come
to think of it, Larizza was a pretty sure candidate for the
ranks of world-famous tenors. His acting was as good as
anything I’ve since seen on the opera stage, and had his
voice been charged with just a little more emotional
undertone, nothing could have held Him back.
A NATURAL AMBITION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now, I fa'n would be the hero of a Melbourne Argus
story
And rank before Jack Sheppard with a halo round my
name ;
So I’ll emulate old Nero in my antics gay and gory—
I’ll kerosene some Christians and I’ll set them all aflame.
I’ll rob the banks and burgle on the latest Bill Sikes
system,
And should I meet a p’liceman he shall die upon the
spot;
I’ll laugh to hear the gurgle of the babies when I twist
’em,
As I sometimes twist a chicken which is fated for the
pot.
My life of crime shall mirth make for supporters of the
press
Who love the “penny dreadful” for the pleasure it
imparts;
Be my sobriquet “ The Earthquake” or “The King of
Wickedness,”
And may my evil doings taint a million little hearts,
I want to leave my blood mark on a million little hearts.
Preferring truth to fiction, I would set a great example
To the larrikins who loiter at the corner of the street,
That after my conviction they may quote me as a sample
Of the White Australian nation, and describe me as a
“ treat.”
Of rhyme my spirit sickens, it will not immortalise me,
All paragraphs must perish like the author’s form of clay ;
If I play the Deadwood Dickens, then the boys will idolise
me,
And I’ll figure in the Argus of a happy future day.
O, a man’s an ignoramus if he cannot understand
That a lasting reputation is derived from being ’ung
If your crimes have made you famous, and your Life is in
demand ...
As a Melbourne Argus story for the guidance of the
young,
A Thunderboltian story for the guidance of the young.

There’s a distinction between sending a yarn as a truth

Not enough material to make a story Jeunesse:

small, sweet futile love verses. The want of a big idea is
the trouble.. ..J.M.: “ Chipping” will appear shortly

idea, but it would be taking a siege gun to kill a worm
to recast the whole Federal Constitution so as to arrange
the border electorates a little more conveniently
3c. : Noted O.T.E. : We admire your gall in
sending that century-old chestnut about the rain

“touching up” seems likely to meet the case....

The young innocent down for the Cup in a
slop suit containing his year’s savings has already
appeared in Melbourne, and the spieler, the con-
fidence man, and the gun are on his track. The
device of the moment for taking in the stranger
with gum-trees in his whiskers is a roll of
notes so folded that each counts two or more if
the wad is not fully unrolled. The wad goes with
a rather tangled and unconvincing story which
isn’t fully unrolled either, and one man has
already purchased a £2O roll for £l5, and found it
worth £7. The device is called “padding the
oof.”

The lack of that nice attention to detail
that marks the genius got a little South Melbourne
factory Lizzie into trouble the other day. A con-
stable who discovered her doing a high kick in the
main street inquired her address, and as the one
she gave—the first that came to mind —happened
to be the policeman’s own address, she was
promptly bowled out.
SURELY A LIBEL.
“ Is he a good actor?” “ He's a clever actor; no actors are good.”
Melbourne police force has always been a
, , . , , -inn i b n
somewhat comic opera body. While Melbourne
was being raided every night by a gang of shop-
breakers, who used to climb upon the roofs and
get in through the slates, extra gangs of detec-
tives were patrolling the streets below. The roof-
thieves were afterwards caught, not on a roof, but
in the ordinary way on the ground, through a lady
whom they had offended giving the show away to
a detective. Now, when lofty thieving has died
out, an official of the department has issued an
order that constables on beat duty in the city are
to pay particular attention to roofs. Seeing that
six average constables would have to stand on top
of eacli other to get a view of an ordinary city
roof, the force naturally asks to be supplied with
balloons. Meanwhile it is doing its best m the
matter of roofs, and while the scarce constable is
watching the Federal Coffee Palace chimneys the
plain ground thief dodges between his legs, and
flees with the plunder.
Lady-mayoress Pleasance stood in the
Council chamber of Melbourne Town Hall on
Tuesday of last week, with forty men in black
coats in a solid ring round her. She was like the
lamb amid the crows in the National Gallery
picture, with no faithful-unto-death mother to
straddle guard over her. The usually brisk and
bustling dame was the picture of unhappy
emotion while Softgoods Henry Butler mounted
the platform of judgment in Pleasance’s own
high-backed seat, and, fixing on her a hard
business eye, sentenced her to receive two tall
folding-screens, inlaid with photographs of
youngsters who attended her big fancy-dress
ball last winter. Accused had nothing to say
in her own defence, but Mayor Pleasance,
after an impassioned appeal, invited the florid-
vested jury to come and let itself be squared in the
refreshment-room.

Watt, the British ex-M.P. who is charged
with trying to engage people to murder his divorced
wife, seems either a rather unlucky or a rather
inefficient person. He was first accused at the
instance of certain people who say he tried
to hire them for the assassination. Then
he produced a cattle-dealer who swore that
he heard these people conspiring in the
street to falsely accuse Watt of trying to
hire them for the assassination. Next the
cattle-man turned round, and said he had been hired
(presumably by Watt) to say that he heard the
other men conspiring in the street to say that
they had been hired by Watt for the assassination,
and the cattle-dealer has been committed for per-
jury. This seems to leave Watt in an awkward
position. Eyen if he produces somebody who swears
he heard two other people hiring the cattle-dealer
to say that he didn’t really hear the first people
agreeing to swear that they were hired by Watt,
and to say that he was hired by Watt to say that
he heard these people, what good will it do
Watt? For then the other side may get more
people to swear that they heard, &c., until Britain
seems like one vast keyhole, and the Watt
case one vast ear listening thereat. But this
sort of thing is difficult. . Great Britain isn’t a
place like India where, when a big ease is on, 100
natives are waiting outside the court and inti-
mating by obscure signals that they are ready to
swear anything for two rupees.

A ceremony held in St. Mary’s Cathedral,
Sydney, during the week was touched with medi-
aeval romance. Evidence connected with the pro-
posed canonisation of Oliver Plunkett, an Irish
Archbishop, martyred in the long ago, was ten-
dered and accepted under oath to be duly for-
warded to Cardinal Logue for presentation at the
Vatican. If Oliver Plunkett be declared a saint,
Australia will therefore have done something
to place him on the Calendar. Although this
country was not known when Oliver Plunkett lived,
the Plunkett family came afterwards to have a
lot to do with Sydney. John Hubert Plunkett
was appointed Attorney-General of N.S.W. before
the days of Responsible Government, and was
afterwards member for Argyle. Later he suc-
ceeded Wentworth as President of the Legislative
Council. At the Bar he was a stern prosecutor.
He secured the conviction of the Major Mudie
insurrectionists, and had five of them hanged.
He sent the Jew Boy gang to the gallows also, and

principals in the Mvall Creek aboriginal outrages,

surroundings, and his penniless widow’s plea for a
pension was a pathetic incident in Parliament

her husband, however, a watch, a chalice and
other articles, certified to have been the property

“Snell” : “ Australia for the Australians”
is a fine cry, and has been in circulation a good
many years now, and
yet how few Austra-
lians one meets who
think Australian
and feel Aus-
tralian as a
Frenchman
thinks and I
feels for
France, or a
Spaniard for
Spain, or a
German for the
Kaiser Bill
country ! The
other day, in
a Melbourne city
hotel bar, a big
sailor, with a thick
foreign accent (he
might have been
Russian, Dane, or
Finn), was cursing
Australia from Gee-
long to Cooktown
and the Swan to Port
Jackson as a land of
cows and be-devilled
wasters. There were
seven men present,
five of them Aus-
tralian born, but
none of them seemed
to feel himself called
upon to put in a word
or a blow for poor
Australia. Then the
sailor man branched off,
and said profane things
about King Edward, and dis-
respectful things about England, and
instantly an irate young man forsook his
beer and smote the foreigner in the wind and
tumbled him under a seat. The avenger was an
Australian.
An ex- navy man tells the People’s Jour-

A boy had been sentenced to receive 12 strokes with

piped to fall in aft to witness the execution of it.
After the charge had been read over, a corporal got
hold of the boy and tied both hands together, likewise his
feet, and placed him over a bollard, face downwards, lash-
ing him down.so that he could only move his head. The
boy was a sturdy-looking little fellow, with all the appear-
ance of being able to stand any amount of knocking
about, but immediately the first stroke came in contact
with his back, he sent up a yell that must have been
heard some considerable distance away. The second and
third produced the same effect, while, the fourth brought
a most horrible look of terror on his face, which was
swollen out like a balloon, his eyes sticking out of their
sockets, and his hair virtually standing on end. He then
seemed to quieten as the succeeding strokes fell, until the
eighth, when he clenched his teeth into his arm, and,
although the same expression of horror was still on his
face, no sound escaped him. He had to be lifted off the
bollard, but whether he was unconscions or not I cannot
say.

A case somewhat similar to that decided by
Solomon, 0. J., in his palace opposite the Bank of
Jerusalem, some thousands of years ago, is to
come on in Victoria shortly. Two women have
laid claim to one child. The mother of the child
died, bequeathing it to its grandmother. While
grandma wasn’t looking, the youngster’s aunt
happened along and, it is alleged, grabbing
the baby, made off down the street. Grand-
mother, the story goes, followed at a sling
trot, but aunt dodged round the town clock and
the cohentingenters’ monument in such a be-
wildering fashion and at-such a pace that granny
had to give up the chase. Now she is going to
sue auntie for larceny of a child, or receiving
stolen property, or something. Unfortunately,
Solomon, the only magistrate who ever specialised
in disputed baby cases, has retired from the busi-
ness. Perhaps Thomas Bent can be induced to
arbitrate.

The recent trial, at Hobart, of two medi-
cal men and a nurse (on a criminal charge concern-
ing the birth-rate and death-rate), afforded an
illustration of the Law’s courtesy to white-handed
prisoners. In the first place, the Judge gave per-
mission for the distressed matron to sit down—a
chair in the dock being one of Woman’s Rights
seemingly. Counsel for one of the doctors desired
the same privilege for his client on the ground of
ill-health, and this was granted. Then the coun-
sel for the other doctor pleaded that his client had
a deteriorated stomach, and the privilege was fur-
ther extended. The trio being comfortably seated
—a doctor on either side of the lady— they were
able to await the verdict of acquittal in a dignified
manner.
THE UNPOPULAR INFANT.
MISS OLKISH : “Surely he doesn't take me fo-
his mother?"
TOMMY : “No; he thinks you're grandmother.”
A smoke-colored person, wearing long
whiskers and a clerical garb, has been hawking a
subscription-list in Queensland begging towards
an orphanage in Chaldea if there is still such
a place ! He is armed with a letter from some
Federal authority saying he has been exempted
from the Alien Restriction Act, and another from
the Hebrew consul, or the Earl of Bagdad, or
some such person, purporting to show he is no
impostor. The law in nearly every decently-con-
ducted country in the world draws the line at
Eersons seeking admission who are likely to
ecome a burden on the State ; but what is this
person but a burden? He will probably carry
away more money from Australia than is sub-
scribed in ten years to many of its own deserving
charities. If Australia shut out such mendicants,
then perhaps Britain would retaliate by running
in our begging bishops who ask Bull for money for
cathedrals —running them in for plain, ordinary
begging. And what a good thing that would be !

From an architectural person :
Bleeds Fitcbett finds fault with the Roman Catholic
Cathedral of Westminster (London) for its roughness of
finish, observing contemptuously that the brickwork is
not even tuckpointed. Which observation puts Fitcbett
in exactly his right place as a critic of architecture. Of
all forms of architectural sham, tuckpointing, with the
one exception of stucco, is probably the most offen-
sive ; and not one architectural authority of any
country could be found to defend it. The prac-
tice of tuckpointing is an outcome of the desire of
the speculative builder of cheap suburban cottages to
hide the cheap bricks and hurried workmanship, and there
is not one decent piece of architecture on record in which
tuck pointed brick-work has been used. In Australia,
where the cheap builder has been multiplied through the
sudden rise of new towns and the sudden booms of
older ones, tuck pointing has become such an evil
that the average suburbanite thinks it pretty and looks
upon his architect as an idiot when he tries to persuade
him not to have his house spoiled by the tuck pointer.
Such an excuse—the excuse of ignorance—is all that
Bleeds Fitchett can plead. In all probability Fitchett's
article on the Louvre will give the place Gehenna for not
having a few oleographs of “ Devotion ” and “ Hush ” on
the walls, while if Fitchett went to Athens, he would
probably reckon that Ictinus, the Greek person who de
signed the Parthenon, didn’t know nis business because
he omitted the ornamental plaster urns and Cupids that
adorn the pinchbeck Hawthorn college over which
Fitchett presides.

Worth noticing that the “evangelical”
clergyman—the sort of preacher who runs a
“ Bethel ” or a “ Bethany,” and sees popes in his
sleep—never speaks of a meeting, or an assem-
blage, or an audience, or a congregation. It is
always “a gathering”—as if it were a boil, or a
whitlow, or something else unpleasant.

I know a garden, hawthorn-hedged,
Where lilac blows ;
There, year by year, young birds are fledged
And smiles the rose.
Old-fashioned flowers bloom in the beds
Bound round with box,
The gayest blues, and pinks, and reds,
Pansies and phlox.
Fruit tree and flower, and shrub and grass,
Pampas and pine,
Together watch the shadow pass
And greet the shine.
In that sweet garden, spring by spring,
Gay brides in white
O’er moss-grown paths their bouquets fling,
Wave, and take flight.
I know a garden ; and I dream
Sometimes I’m there.
I wake ! Grey roofs, the newsboy’s scream,
Town, dust, and glare.

The Bulletin gets this note from
“ Brunelys ” :
This is an advt. I sent to the Herald :
■\TOUNG Lady wishes to correspond with a fellow-
T Australian having brains and energy, who knows
his country and believes in it.
BRUNELYS, G.P.O.
I know that most of the people who read the Herald
“Personal” column are not the sort of correspondents I
want, and no doubt somewhere out-back there is just the
man I’d like to hear from (he is sure to read The Bulletin
regularly). Meanwhile, I dare say, some anaemic ware-
house clerk is writing suggesting “an appointment.” I
can’t go down to your office and face the clerks there and
ask them in a matter-of-fact way whether you’ll print my
message, and how much you’ll charge for it; but will you
let me know these things next issue ?
As to the charge, “Brunelys” must come down
and face the clerks, or send it in as “conscience
money ” —as much as she paid the Herald.

The much-cracked-up Melbourne Hospital,
which recently bought the title “Royal” at a
cost of £5O, is run by certain old personages who
believe in cheapness. They pay an experienced
doctor £6 a week to look after the whole show.
Under him there are eight resident surgeons.
Their salary per year is nothing. They are the
seven honor men and the one honor woman
who finished highest on the list in their last
year of medicine at Melbourne ’Varsity. They
are at the Hospital to get experience and
no wages. Most of them need the wages.
All of them need the experience. At
Melbourne Hospital there is no observation
ward. A patient is either admitted or sent away.
The inexperienced, lady-like resident surgeons are
supposed to be always cocksure whether a man is
ill, or dumb, or only malingering. Last week a
well-known sharebroker was found sitting in a
train that had been shunted out of the platform.
It was 10 i.n the morning. The sharebroker—
John Jack—was as nearly unconscious as a man
who is still able to sit up could be. He was
whizzed off to the hospital in a cab. A resident
surgeon had a look at him, and diagnosed the case
as “drunk.” John Jack was yanked away to the
lockup and charged with being drunk and dis-
orderly. Four hours later the watchhouse-
keeper had a look at him, and guessed he was going
to die. Once more John Jack was whizzed off to the
hospital. Another resident surgeon diagnosed
the case as uraemia, and on that basis John Jack
died in an hour and a half. A post mortem
proved that it was apoplexy. According to the
“ great dailies,” indignation was freely expressed
in the city. There the matter seems to have
dropped. It was no one’s place to ask how it
happened that, merely for the sake of cheapness,
a slip of a boy or a girl, fresh from the honor-list
of the University, should be allowed to decide
that a man suffering from apoplexy was drunk, or
to inquire how many other poor sick devils have
been hustled into the cells of Melb. city lock-up
when they should have been put to bed and
tended.

The question of making a land concession
to parents of large families, as in some States in
America, or of presenting a money prize, as in
parts of France, retains its charm with several
Federal legislators. Senator Plavford’s statement,
the other day, that he has brought up five sons, all
over 6ft. high, suggests a variation —why not
measure the family as a continuous string, and
give a bonus for all families over 30ft. long?

Something akin to a tragedy has hap-
Eened at North Melbourne. Some progress is
eing made in the amalgamation of many wasteful
municipalities into a Greater Melbourne, and this
month Flemington and North Melbourne end
their separate existence. The council of the latter
borough held its funeral meeting last week. The
abolished aldermen said good-bye to each other
and to the abolished town clerk, and then, busi-
ness being ended, the abolished mayor felt in the
pocket of the clothes that were soon to cover a
mere private citizen for the key of the whisky
cupboard. It wasn’t there, and North Mel-
bourne, in a municipal sense, perished without
even a chance to drink to its own burial. The
final remark made in the abandoned council
chamber was: “This is the last straw.”

The sweetest thing in attentions bestowed
on the Anglican Synod, sitting in Sydney, was
the S.M. Herald’s action in sending its lady

black velvet stoles, and is tied under the chin with

“Ex-Londoner”
tells a candid tale: —
Bulletin seems to
stick up a fetish of Eng-
lish personal cleanli-
ness, to knock it down
again with occasional
chunks of fact. It is
easily knocked, but I
don’t think England
itself lays claim to
cleanliness. Young
men of the Public
School and ’Varsity
class are trained to
the morning tub
(which mostly
means a flat pan
with two inches
of water and a
sponge); possi-
bly their sisters
are acquiring
the habit now.
In my time,
soap was hardly
ever used in
“thetub.” The
elders do as they
please, the loud
talk about bath-
ing probably
coming from
the very few
who do bathe.
With the well-
to-do trading
class, a small
bath on Satur-
day night for
the children
was the rule,
with the merely
occasional wash-
ing of feet for the
seniors. My own
experience can
swear to (1) Girls’
boarding -school
of 30 to 40 pupils,
with one bath —
an after-thought,
let into the side
of a “music-
r o o m,” and
sacred to Satur-
day night. (2)

the swimming-
bath was built) a
warm bath in ro-
tation about

Lots of houses of six
or eight rooms with-
out a sign of a bathroom.
To put it candidly, brought up among the (say) £3OO a
year class in England, I never realised what cleanliness
meant till I came to Australia.

A West Melbourne doctor had an unusual
experience in a confinement case recently. During
the delivery the mother was callingout “Murder!”
or something. The bedroom was close to the
street, and a constable heard the riot. He drew
his baton, fixed his helmet firmly on his head, and
rushed to the rescue. The door was locked, but
he leaped at it with hands and feet. The doctor,
anxious for his patient, coatless and somewhat
dishevelled, came to the door to quell the dis-
turbance the Law was making ; but his appearance
only created further suspicion, and the Law wanted
to march him straight off, spite of his declaration
that he was lawfully practising his profession. As
a concession, Constable X waited till the suspect
was ready to go with him to the watch-house.
There the identity of the furious medico was
established, and the policeman apologised—though
after all it is difficult to see that he had much to
apologise for. When a policeman hears shrieks
of “murder” he is supposed to rush to the spot
and make a searching investigation, and do battle
with the enemy. That is what he is paid 365. a
week or thereabouts for—and find his own boots.

Description given, in a recent police court
case, of a;Perth (W.A.) dairy, milking from 30 to
45 cows:—
Stock yard in a very dirty state, and drainage defective.
Copper for heating water emitted dense clouds of smoke,
which filled the milking-shed, adjoining which was a room
containing a quantity of horse manure, rotten bags and
bones. On the floor of the milk room was a pool of dirty
water. A mass of foetid water with a thick green scum
was on one side, and the stock yard was a miry bog,
through which cows were driven knee deep. When bailed
up they brought the filth in with them, and flicked it into
themilk pails, on to the milker, and spattered it over his
clothes. As the cows struggled in to get milked their
teats and udders trailed through the malodorous muck,
and several cows were milked by one man, whose hands
were not washed throughout the process.
The health inspector told off to report on the dairy
added to the foregoing, description that, although
a notice was stuck up to the effect that smoking
was strictly forbidden, the owner and his brother
were both smoking cigarettes, and assumed a belli-
cose attitude when the nature of the visit was
made known. A small fine was imposed by the
fine old crusted ’Groper beak before whom the case
was heard. About the same time one of the
biggest wholesale butchering firms appeared to
answer a charge of feeding pigs on raw, putrid
offal. The firm did not offer any defence, and was
fined—one shilling !

Melb. Age publishes a diagram showing
to what extent Victoria tanglefooted during two
decades. In the boom days of ’9O, average con-
sumption of alcoholic liquor reached £6 a head.
With the Dursting of the boom it got down to £3
a head in ’93, ’94, and ’95. A remarkable thing is
that in 1901, when the small York arrived, and
Victoria “did the thing properly,” the drink bill
suddenly j urnped from £3 10s. to £4 10s. a head.
James Balfour, the most arrogant Sabba-
tarian in Yic. Leg. Council, has the audacity to
say that “ the great voice of the country ” has
declared against the idea of “turning Sunday
into a day of amusement” and cheap railway
travelling. Why, when Bent lately sounded the
country on the question of Balfourising the
blessed Sabbath the country uttered a yell of
indignation. On the question of making it a
bright Sun-day, the country has never had the
chance to poll an opinion, but if it got the chance
it would shock Balfour.

Under the heading “ Australia a White
Man’s Country,” an English provincial paper (the
Andover Advertiser) publishes some useful in-
formation, which points to the fact that Coghlan
has been at work. A common Cold Country as-
sumption of the enervating nature of our climate
is traversed by the following facts, which will
probabty surprise a good many Australians them-
selves:—
The summer temperature of Sydney is only four degrees
warmer than that of Paris ; that of Kiandra, in the Snowy
Mountain country, corresponds with that of Edinburgh ;
the Monaro plains with the English Midland Counties;
that of Queanbeyan with Swansea, in Wales ; Bombala
with London ; Cooma with Ventnor, in the Isle of Wight;
portion of the Monaro Plains with Normandy ; Bathurst
Plains with Central France ; Faulconbridge, on the Blue
Mountains, with Lyons ; Orange and Goulburn with Tou-
louse, Montpelier and Lombardy ; Bathurst with Bor-
deaux ; Muswellbrook and. Mudgee .with Nice ; Invereil
with Florence and Montpelier; Sydney with Toulon ;
Scone with Barcelona and Naples ; Cassilis with Lisbon ;
Tenterfield with Madrid ; Dubbo with Rome ; and Bourlce
with Messina, in Sicily. The Victorian climate resembles
that of New South Wales, the mean summer temperature
in Melbourne approximating to that of Madrid, Lisbon
and Washington. Taking the whole of the southern half
of Australia, it may fairly be said that the climate is of a
most enjoyable character throughout the year, and in the
greater portion of the northern half not less pleasant than
that of the countries of the Mediterranean.

H.M.S. Powerful succeeds H.M.S. Eurya-
lus as flagship on the Australian station. It bulks
larger, carries more six-inch guns, and has
85 more men in its crew to distribute their wages
in Sydney. From which point of view (the most
important one, it seems, to our politicians) it
strengthens the Australian squadron. The Eurya-
lus is worth two of it as a fighting machine. As,
however, the Australian squadron is only Aus-
tralian in time of peace, that is the last qualifica-
tion to be considered. The Powerful requires 29
feet of water in which to float, and will therefore
be able to steam out of Sydney—when the tide is
high. It will negotiate with difficulty all other
Australian ports, except Hobart. It is not a first-
class armored cruiser, though the naval agree-
ment with Great Britain provides that the flagship
should be one ; but, after all, what does defensive
power matter to us as long as there are more
sailors to drink Sydney beer and more' officers to
flirt with Melbourne girls ?

Is Premier Benfc pulling Victoria’s leg again ?
It doesn’t look at all unlikely. He had a revenue last
year of £7,509,657; this year he says he expects to get
only £7,145,753, or £363,904 less. Last year’s expenditure
was £6,982,673; this year’s he expects to be £7,133,516,
or £150,843 more. Last year he had a surplus of £526,984 ;
this year he says he only expects £12,237. Thus for this
year he expects :
Less revenue £363,904
More expenditure .. .. 150,843
Surplus 12,237
Amount of last year’s surplus.. £526,984
Treasurer Bent, having been in the market-gardening
business, knows how many beans make five. He knows
that the Treasurer who gets most cheers and inspires
most confidence is not the Treasurer who can make the
truest estimate of receipts and expenditure, but the one
who can produce a surplus by under-estimating revenue
and over-estimating expenditure. When he produces his
surplus, it is something dragged out of the fire of circum-
stances by an effort of genius, and is applauded accord-
ingly.
But Bent is probably right in assuming that
Victoria won’t have the revenue this year that it had last.
The Commonwealth refunds will, according to the Aus-
tralian Treasury estimate, be £109,464 less than they
were last year. This is nothing to grieve o.ver. The Com-
monwealth has new works —post-offices, telegraph lines,
telephones, &c. —to provide, and it is providing them out
of revenue, instead of out of loans. For all Australia this
expenditure in the postal department this year is esti-
mated at just over £200,000. The Commonwealth asks
Australia to be a man and pay the bill, instead of wearing
out the works and passing the bill on to Australia junior,
and that accounts for most of the shrinkage in this line.
Another shrinkage is in the railways. The Vic. rail-
ways last year showed a profit of £41,629. For
this year a loss of £56,187 is anticipated. Bent
explains that the Commissioners propose to make
various concessions in freights and fares. If this is
on the strength of last year’s profit, it is mighty poor
foundation to build concessions upon. Only four times
previously have the railways shown any surplus at all; so
that there is a vast amount of leeway to make up. In the
10 years I 394-1903, the leeway amounted to £2,998,698,
exclusive of the £750,000 or so paid in pensions and
gratuities, which were not charged against revenue, as they
ought to be. To a very large extent this railway loss has
been added to the public debt; it has resulted in so
much less being available to pay for general works
out of revenue, so the works have been paid for out of
loans. Instead, therefore, of making concessions which
will turn the very rare surplus into a deficit, it seems
about up to the railways, if they can, to wipe out a bit of
the Victorian debt for which they have been partly
responsible.
Bent expects also to get £120,000 less from land
revenue than he did last year. He will probably get
something less ; and the reason knocks one tidy-sized
hole in the bottom of Bent’s surplus for last year. Seven
years ago the arrears in selector’s payments amounted to
£755,703 ; and that was one cause of the Kyabrama-
pootra’s great activity three or four years ago—it had
ideas about getting those arrears dealt with in the same
comfortable way as the water-supply debts had been. A
couple of extra-good years knocked out that scheme,
and the boss tax-dodgers of the State had to part
up. Bent deserves credit for getting in all but £128,943
of this back money ; and that is where some of his surplus
came from. But, all the same, it wasn’t revenue proper
to the year. Much of it, in fact, wasn’t revenue at all.
In the last half-year alone land sales brought in £199,277.
This is a much smaller offence than the corresponding
offence in N.S. Wales, where a quarter of a million of
these assets are improperly converted and used as revenue
every three months ; but it is a good-sized offence, never-
theless. Deduct this money from the reported revenue,
and even Bent’s half-million credit balance would look
very sick.
Last year Victoria reduced its funded debt by
£60,412, and Bent thereby earned this paper’s forgiveness
for many things that called for a lot of forgiving. But
this paper isn’t sure how long it can go on forgiving him.
This year he deliberately proposes no debt-reduction at
all, though, on his own admission, there is £3,907,705 of
absolutely unproductive debt outstanding. On the other
hand, there is the suspicion that Thomas is pulling Vic-
toria’s leg, and that he doesn’t really intend to land with
only a £12,237 surplus—that he is preparing all the while
for something more extensive. What he will do with it
when he gets it, if he does get it, Thomas isn’t telling ;
but to earn this paper’s continued forgiveness there is no
better way of using it than to start wiping out that dead
debt with energy.
* * * *
Whenever the State lifts its hand to do anything
for the public benefit, there is a screech that it musn’t
interfere with the sacred rights of Propputty. But, when
Propputty itself gets a chance, it hasn’t any scruples
about interfering with other Propputty—the sacred rights
apparently don’t count in that case. The Tasmania Gold
Mine (Tas.) was recently passed on to J. Bull, mostly
because of the shocking improvidence of the Tasmania
Cos. which tore out the easily-got gold and paid £772,072
in divs. on a capital of £158,559, and then said it couldn’t
afford to cope with the water difficulty. The J. Bull
Cos. took the concern over, and one of the means
by which it proposes to cope with the diffi-
culty is contained in a long private Bill, now before
the Speck Parliament ; though, as the Bill is said to have
been drafted by Attorney-General Gilmore, apparently
there isn’t much solid difference between it and a Govern-
ment measure. This Bill proposes to practically repeal
all Tasmanian mining legislation so far as this foreign co.
is concerned, and to allow it to swap the leases it has for
any others it may take a fancy to, and to grab any ad-
jacent land that it may want ; and the before-mentioned
sacred rights of Propputty are handed over to the co.
on a dish, inasmuch as the co. can go on to
anybody else’s land without the owner’s consent, and
make surveys ; and upon giving notice it may take as
much of that land as it wants in order to carry out any
work, including mining (it is to give compensation for
this); also it may divert any streams ; and the co. may
enter lands of which anybody may acquire the freehold
from the State after the passing of the Act, and do what
damage it pleases, and be exempt from paying any com-
pensation whatever. This last clause means that the
State is hereafter only to sell lands on the under-
standing that, no matter who buys them, the co. is
really the owner of them and can do what it likes
with them. After that, the Bill proposes to give this
incredibly bumptious British grabber practically unlimited
powers to go in for the generation and public supply of
electricity. There isn’t any limit to the amount it may
charge for power or lighting. Arbitration, it seems, is
an excellent thing to apply to people whose property the
co. wants to get hold of; but it isn’t to apply to the ser-
vices which tiie co. renders. It’s a good thing to see that
nobody exacts too much from the foreign "co. ; but the
idea of seeing that the foreign co. doesn’t exact too much
from the Tasmanian public isp’t mentioned in the Bill.
The consideration for all this is that the co. spends
£IBO,OOO ; but as that was ivhat the co. was formed for,
before ever this Act was mentioned, the consideration
amounts to just about nothing. Fortunately, the Bill
isn’t law’ yet; and a State that very well knows, or ought
to very well know, how hard an octopus can suck,
shouldn’t take long in deciding that it isn’t the sort of
Bill that should ever become law.

From a man in the business, though that doesn’t
make his arguments worth any less: —“Reciprocity, like
charity, Should commence at home, but we find Austra-
lian Governments deliberately passing over Australian
institutions in favor of British or other foreign institu-
tions. Australian manufacturers also, whoask why we don’t
buy locally-made pianos, sewing machines, biscuits, etc.,
insure or bank with foreign companies that bring nothing
into the country except their stationery, and openly
declare war against Australian offices, and do their utmost
to crush them. Private individuals, some of them loudest
in the cry of ‘ Australia for Australians,’ forget this when
they are renewing their insurance policies.. It may
surprise some Bulletin readers to learn that nearly ail
the leading Australian life offices insure their buildings
with foreign institutions, or foreign institutions mas-
querading under an Australian appellation'; it may sur-
prise them still more to learn that N.S.W. Government
marine insurance is done with a Chinese office. Our
universities, churches, hospitals, municipal properties are
nearly all insured also with foreign companies. Oil trusts
come here and ask Australians to buy their oil. Their
insurances? Oh ! no, they are ‘ fixed up at home.’ A
sewing machine-importing firm : their insurances? ‘No!
we always insure with English offices.’ The evil is not
confined to the risks which foreign offices take here and
hold. With one exception, all the foreign offices repre-
sented here have what are termed ‘ treaties,’ whereby
they take all the business they can secure and pass
on to German, Russian, French and Spanish companies
what they do not care to hold themselves.
“ And the shortsightedness of it all! If an Australian
co. pays a dividend to Australian residents, the latter
spend the m ney in the country ; and who can say where
the effects of that dividend end? It may be spent in
building houses, invested in some industrial undertaking,
turned into a thousand other channels. We are twitted
with parsimony in our expenditure on the military and
naval defences of our country, and we reply we cannot
afford to pay more. If half the profit taken by foreign
banks and insurance co.’s out of the country had been
kept here we would not have to plead poverty. Drought
and misgovernment have much to answer for ; but apathy
in looking after our own has more. The greatest sinner
of all is N.S.W. In Maoriland a tax is placed upon
foreign insurance co.’s, and Australian co.’s are considered
as such ; moreover in that State and also in Victoria the
people recognise theneeessity of giving the preference to
local offices. But in N.S.W. that appeal is too often
met either with a smirk or a shrug.
“ The argument is used that English offices are
stronger than Australian offices, and the list of Australian
co.’s that have been absorbed during the past decade has
been submitted as evidence. Yet for every Australian
insurance office that has been absorbed during the last
ten years, I will name two English offices that have gone
the same way; and most of the latter have arrived at
that condition by reason of absolute gambling in the
conflagration hazard. There is not an Australian co. to-
day whose directors cannot say that if half the cities of
Sydney and Melbourne were burned out in one year, its
income and reserves of capital would not be sufficient to pay
its share of the loss. I wonder how many of the foreign
institutions could say the same of a similar conflagration ?
And with their world-wide liabilities who can answer for
it that even the best-looking of them are stronger than
the Australian co.’s ? ”

The paid capital hitherto was £64,628 ; this has now been
increased to £100,000, partly by capitalising profits, partly
by issuing shares at a premium. Apparently all but £3058
of the new capital was subspribed out of profits ; and for
this £3058 the price paid was £12,469, so that the premium
amounted to a little over 300 per cent. It is a remarkable
result; but, then, the size of the reserves, in which the
newcomers buy an interest, is very fine, too. No doubt
the dividend ought to be shown on the capital actually
subscribed ; but the issue of the few shares at a premium
complicates the situation. On the actually paid capital,
including the total amount recently subscribed, the divi-
dend is at the average rate of 32 per cent.; the old share-
holders draw 37£ per cent.; the new, 6 per cent. In addi-
tion to the reserves shown above, there is a reserve of
£56,097 for outstanding losses ; this is in addition to the
amount charged to profit and loss, which it is estimated
is required to cover unexpired risks.
The business of the South British has, during
the past year, been rather less profitable than usual.
Possibly on account of the keener competition in Maori-
land, due to the opening of the State Fire Insurance De-
partment, expenses have increased very rapidly. On the
other hand, a notable feature is the increase in the total
of premiums, though M.L. rates have fallen considerably.
This would account for some increased expenses ; it is
necessary to cover more ground to reach even the old total.
A comparison for some past years shows up as follows :—

The co.’s securities are highly profitable. The year’s
interest earnings on the average amount of the total
assets, including balances at branches, was no less than
£4 16s. per cent. The £548,096 of assets include £171,343
of landed property, £116,180 mortgages, £52,000 fixed
deposits, and the balance mostly public stocks and cash
balances. In view of the remarkably high return (the
interest alone more than pays the 25 per cent. div. on
capital), it looks as though the co. has either a perfect
genius for investment or has written securities down
hard. In either case it is something that both share-
holders and the co.’s clients can view with much satis-
faction.

Carrying a liability of £4 17s. 6d. on every £5 share, stock
in this co. must give the investor some concern, and it
might, therefore, have been expected that he would have
been content to allow the reserves to grow a little more
before the dividend was put up. Yet this can be said for
the management: even the 10 per cent, absorbs only 37
per cent, of the profits, so that the lay-by is still very
substantial indeed. Moreover, this is one of the trustee
co.’s which set out that corpus commissions are not
passed into profits immediately estates come in ; so that
profits are nearer the real profits, actually received, than
they are in some other trustee co.’s. it isn’t easy to
understand why a co. which follows a good practice so
far doesn’t follow it further, and separate interest
earnings from commissions, so that the real value of the
reserves might be subjected to the only possible test.
The value of trust estates in hand continues to grow
steadily:—

An increase of 100 per cent, in six years is excellent-
excellent for the eo., and excellent for the public, which
is finding- out that a trustee eo. is much more likely to be
a satisfactory trustee than a person who has no special
qualifications or facilities for the work. The expenses of
management are small. A comparison :—

Considering the number of trustee co.’s in Melbourne
while there arc only two in N.S. Wales, the Victorians are
seen (from the foregoing figures alone) to be much more
alive to the advantages of such co.’s than Sydney-siders
are. The low cost at which this co. works, combined
probably with profitable investments, enables it to show
on total shareholders’ funds the highly satisfactory return
of £l9 6s. 6d. per cent. No other Australasian co. con-
fining itself to trustee business does much better than
that. The Perpetual (Sydney) last year showed £2O Bs. lid.

The principal reserve item is a contingency fund, which
now stands at £17,347 ; 12 months ago it stood at
£22,748; the difference, £5401, is the gap between
the book-value and the sale-value of properties
realised during the year. Including all classes
of foreclosures, the total book-value of these assets
12 months ago was £63,745; it is now £54,245.
Apparently, therefore, the properties disposed of stood in
the books at £9500; and they realised £4099. These
figures do not tally exactly with some furnished in the
directors’ report; there it is said that £4697 was realised.
The explanation probably is that some more properties
were foreclosed during the year, and the total dealt in
was larger than appears on the surface. In any case,
however, the foreclosed properties realised less than half
their book value ; and if that gives anything like a fair
idea of the real value of the remaining £54,245 of
foreclosed properties, then the whole contingency fund,
and a good deal more, will be swallowed in providing
for the deficiency when the properties are sold. Proba-
bly things are not quite so bad as that; still that
they are pretty bad is shown by the fact that the net
rents only returned £2 16s. 4d. per cent, on the average
amount of book values. The wisdom of putting up the
dividend to 4 per cent, is, therefore, still in doubt. The
Langridge is the rare building-society which didn’t
write off any capital; and it would be something to be
sorry for if, through excessive dividends, it found itself
in the end obliged to do anything of that sort. It is cer-
tainly more than probable that it will pull through
without; for, though it has borrowed practically no more
from the public, its new advances on building-society
terms have moved from £53,606 in 1903 to £56,527 in 1904,
and along to £58,478 in 1905 ; and the profit on this will
probably fill up the cavern, assuming that there is a
cavern beyond the capacity of the present reserves.

This society stands just about where it stood 12 months
ago. Share capital is £29,424 now against £29,807 then,
advances £34,006 against £33,897, deposits £4162 against
£4441. The result of these movements is that the bank
balance has been reduced from £1349 to £563. The
before-mentioned advances, which include foreclosures,
are in at book values; how much property (book-
value) was sold to show the £53 loss it is impossible
to say. But as the interest earnings are only just
under 6 p.c., the assets are probably not very seriously
over-valued. The cost of management, amounting to
23 per cent, of the earnings, is high; but that is in-
evitable in so small a business. Still even some larger
societies show higher figures—in the Langridge (Melb.),
for instance, these expenses (which, of course, the bor-
rowers have to bear in the long run) absorb 25 per cent.
In the matter of building loans and life insurance it’s the
same as it is in the matter of buying firewood by the
Jcwt. The world doesn’t always grease the fat pig ; but
it’s a mighty lot easier for the fat pig to get fatter than it
is for the lean pig to make a start at putting on flesh. And
when the lean pig has for three consecutive years taken
some money from reserves to pay dividends with, as the
above society has done, the fattening process seems in-
definitely postponed.

This co. sells land on time-payment, and puts part of its
profits to a contingency account to provide for possible
losses on land sold on long terms ; and in the past half-
year enough losses have shown up to reduce this contin-
gency fund from £3592 to £2571. Current business has
given about the usual results ; but the losses on old
transactions spoil the look of things. The co.’s assets,
other than cash and fixed deposits, total £38,513 ; and as
the co.’s capital and reserves stand at £14,483, or nearly
40 per cent, of such assets, there appears to be a very safe
margin for the security of deposits, etc. Freeholds and
balances due by purchasers (the latter the principal item)
may shrink ; but a 40 per cent, shrinkage seems highly
improbable.
* * * ♦
In the matter of the bite that London directors
take out of J. Bull’s Westralian mining profits, when
there are any, Oroya-Brown Hill looks about the
worst case. Directors’ fees amount to £I3OO a year;
on top of that is directors’ commission—a percentage on
earnings—£9s62. There are five directors, so they average
£1912 each. And they do so little managing that the
Australian management costs run to £5963. Total in
England, £13,608 ; in Australia, £5963. Associated also
pays the directors a percentage in addition to their fees.
Fees last year were £1333; percentage, £1238. Great
Boulder paid in fees and percentage, £4500;
Fingall in the same way, £2500; Ivanhoe,
£4700. In addition to the directors’ bite, Fingall supplies
Bewick-Moreing with a percentage. Lake View Consols
is more moderate ; but even in that case management
expenses ran to £3497 in England and £4668 in Australia
—latter including the general manager’s percentage on
dividends. Perseverance is the worst case after Oroya-
Brown Hill; directors’ fees and “ extra remuneration,”
£6039 ; London rent and salaries, £1983 ; management
expenses in Westralia, £6616. But the management in
Australia at least does something for its money, whereas
what the London directors do isn’t worth mentioning
most times, and when it is worth mentioning it is gener-
ally also worth scorn.
The system of payment or part-payment by per-
centage is the invention of the devil, so far as mining is
concerned. When dividends are paid by rushing out ore,
and neglecting development and the safety of the mine,
the only bonus the management deserves is gaol. A per-
centage of profits is an inducement held out to a director
whose tenure of office is uncertain to rush things,
and trust to luck to pull through. He may be re-
elected, and it may not matter whether he pays the big
divs. this year or next; but a bird in the hand is worth
two in the middle of next year; so his business
is to pay the divs. this year and be sure. The
ups ana downs in Westralian mining yields can’t all be
charged to this system, certainly ; but some of them can.
And the market moves with the output. When it was
making fireworks, shares in Lake View Consols went to
£2B 12s. 6d. ; present price is £1 10s. Associated touched
£l7 10s. ; present price, £3. The system therefore plays
into the hands of the man who hangs his gamble on to
mining—and he is the man who generally talks most
about “ the development of the mining industry,” and the
sinfulness of labor covenants. Further, since mine-
directorships in London are worth anything up to £I9OO
a year apiece, besides what can be picked up on the door-
step, guinea-pigs find it worth while to stand in with
market operators ; they buy their seats, in short, by
undertaking to give early information as to the proper
time to pass the baby on to the outsiders. “ Payment by
results” sounds plausible, but results of 12 months’ work
are not to be reckoned up by the divs. paid in that time ;
and shareholders ought to jump with all their feet on a
system which is beginning to push its nose into other
fields in Australia. Bull’s folly won’t excuse Australia’s
folly.

The Broken Hill Prop, has hitherto paid its
directors £3OOO a year, but at the last meeting put the
amount up to £4OOO. A mine working for industrial
metals isn’t, however, on the same footing as a gold mine ;
the directors’ work is, or ought to be, vastly greater.
Sulphide Corporation paid last year £2500 in directors’
fees. This is the only Barrier co. whose directors also
take a percentage bite out of profits. Compared with
the B.H. Prop., whose directors are in Australia, the
Sulphide Corporation, whose directors are in London
and have never been suspected of any great services, pays
dearly—the most dearly of all B.H. co.’s. Block 10
is economical; last half-year’s Melbourne, London, and
Sydney expenses, including directors’fees, reached £1459 —
under £3OOO per year. The various items are not sepa-
rated. Sulphide Corporation’s expenses of the same
character were £6335. B.H. South pays its directors £ISOO
a year, and ran its Melbourne and Adelaide offices last
half-year on £367 ; add £lO5 for printing, stationery, &c.,
£64 for travelling expenses, and £32 audit fees, and you
get, for its size, the figures of about the most economically-
run co. at Broken Hill. But when comparing the South
with the B.H. Prop, it mustn’t be forgotten that the
Prop, does its own ore-treatment, while the South sells
its product crude. The North’s total office and manage-
ment costs last half-year were £664 (directors,
£2oo)—another excellent piece of economy. Bendigo
co.’s are generally supposed to about reach the limit in
the matter of economy in management expenses ; direc-
tors there work down to ss. a meeting, and the manager
runs half-a-dozen or more co.’s in a 10 xl2 office. New
Moon’s management costs about £SOO a year ; and the
New Moon has been trying to live up to its affluence, and
is a prodigal compared with some. But Bendigo has been
outdone by the Vulcan Tin-mining Cos. (N.Q.) ; last half-
year it paid in divs. £15,400, and the cormorant direc-
tors and auditors among them cut up £4O 4s. Compare
that with the neighboring Ohillagoe, which didn’t pay
any £15,400 in divs., yet handed out to directors, trus-
tees and auditors £2420 ; and paid in general office ex-
penses, exclusive of postage, advertising, &e., £2928.

Queensland gold returns for the first nine
months of the year show a fall of 30,1080 z., valued at
£127,890, compared with the corresponding period of
1904. Respective figures are : Jan.-Sept., 1904, 466,3940 z.,
valued at £1,981,114 ; Jan.-Sept., 1905, 436,2860 z., valued
at £1,853,224. The gold is reported in fine oz.,
and it will take Queensland all its time to show
550,0000 z. for this complete year. Only once
since 1896 has the yield fallen below 600,0000 z.
and in 1903 it got up to 668,5460 z. The trouble is that the
Towers and Gympie temporarily played themselves out
almost at the same moment, and nothing else in the gold
way came along to take their place—for which blame the
drought and the difficulties of prospecting during a few
years past.

A great quantity of good beer and indifferent
language were wasted at the christening of the Carring-
ton’s P.C. battery, Charters Towers. Show is 28 miles
out, and very scanty information about it is supplied to
shareholders. On this occasion, however, the mine was
open to all for inspection. Consequently shares advanced
in values, although the P.C. is only in the development
stage. Lode is almost vertical, the fall being 2ft. in 150 ft.
and has been located by two crosscuts, one at 60ft. and
the second at 160 ft. Lease has traces of minerals all
through ; lode recently cut by the latter crosscut, of
which five tons were saved, gives (bulk assays) 3oz. 14dwt.
gold, 14'9 p.c. copper, and 2oz. lldwt. silver. Levels off
these show up to 3ft. of stone, from which some extra-
ordinary prospects have been got. Treatment will be the
vexed question. The erection of a Huntingdon mill, con-
centrator, and grinders can only be regarded as an experi-
ment. Cos. has a complete assay plant, yet directors
refused at the half-yearly meeting to give values of the
12 months’ stone in sight, although they admit that it
has been sampled. The chairman explained that the
tests were misleading, inasmuch as the battery results
had always exceeded the assays. Method of handling
Carrington’s was, and is now, similar to that pursuedin con-
nection with a number of unnecessary floats and dead cats,
consequently the P.C. has been viewed with suspicion.
No outsider knew for certain that it was more than a sur-
face patch. Main shaft is down 193 ft., and the sink is to
be pushed down without delay. So far the crushings
have averaged £25 16s. per ton for 216 tons. Returns will
find a lower average now that the co. has its own mill and
bulk crushings have started. Stone has been graded, and
about 270 tons of seconds that will probably go over the
ounce are awaiting treatment. Financially the co. is
pretty sound ; after paying for development, plant, and
machinery in six months, the debit is only £lO2l. Direc-
tors’ fees (there are five directors on the Towers and two
in England) were only £3O for the term. It w'ould be
better for holders to pay the directors more money and
get a little more information concerning the property.
Show’, 400 ft. by 400 ft., looks like putting up nearly a dis-
trict record by paying a dividend before making a call.
But how many divs. is still doubtful. The Excess, adjoin-
ing the P. 0., has crushed 20 tons 15cwt. for iOoz. 12dwt.
gold, so has failed to locate the rich stone. The P.C. can
still only be regarded as a patch ; the other shows in the
locality are, so far, duffers. Some gave up the battle early,
others have six months’ exemption, in order to recoup
their finances after six months’ work.

For the month Queen Cross, Charters Towers,
turned out 3050 tons for 25610 z. Cos. met with the mis-
fortune to its mill when the mine workings were in a
position least able to bear it. The damage, caused by the
recent explosion that wrecked the battery, is estimated at
£4OOO. Looks are deceptive, and at the time of writing a
thorough examination, by an engineer, of the remaining
parts has not been made ; consequently the estimate may
be exceeded. Cos. is in the habit of declaring a 6d.
monthly dividend amounting to £SOOO. If the estimate
is correct it will mean that a dividend will cover costs ;
yet market eased Is. 4d. Cos. had a credit at commence-
ment of this term (May) of £12,545, of which £IO,OOO was
at fixed deposit.

A matter of great importance to the mining
community has just been decided by the Supreme Court
of Victoria in an action by the Wilfley Ore Concentrator
Syndicate Limited against N. Guthridge Limited, and it
has held that the well-known Wilfley Patent is valid and
has been infringed by N. Guthridge Limited by the sale
and manufacture of tables which they call the Card Con-
centrator. The action took 28 days in hearing, numerous
eminent scientific and practical experts being called for
both sides ; the Court granted a certificate of the validity
of the Wilfley Patent and ordered N. Guthridge Limited
to pay damages and costs, and further granted an injunc-
tion restraining N. Guthridge Limited from infringing the
Wilfley Patent. The Wilfley Table is protected by Letters
Patent throughout Australasia and the proprietors wish
to notify all vendors and users that all infringements will
be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.*

The British Broken Hill Silver Mining Co.,
after careful consideration of all types of boilers, have
placed an order with Babcock and Wilcox for three large
boilers, each of 500 h.p. Superheaters, chain grate
mechanical stokers and economiser have also been
ordered from the same firm. This now makes 40 boilers
of the Babcock and Wilcox type supplied to the various
mines and industries at Broken Hill. Wherever economy
in fuel and maintenance of boiler has to be seriously con-
sidered by competent engineers, the Babcock boiler is
installed. Hence the recent unanimous decision of the
Expert' Admiralty Committee to install Babcock boilers as
the standard for the British Navy.*

“German Eisen Zeitung (iron journal) for July
snows the extraordinary growth of “ Automobilismus ”
in that country. The manufacture of motor vehicles has
been reckoned in Germany as a separate industry only
since 1902; figures showing value of exports from that
year onward are:—
1902. 1903. 1904.
Motor-cars for passengers .. £237,050 £264,400 £688,850
~ for goods .. 30,400 36,950 . 68,600
Motor-bioycles .. .. 4,800 29,250 "61,060
Total £272,250 £330,600 £718,600
The value of motor-ears and motor-bicycles manufactured
in 1904 for home consumption was £2,500,000 ; grand
total, over £3,200,000 for the year. Not a bad record for
an industry that is yet in its babyhood. But, then,
Germany is not cursed with Reids and Cooks.
Mungana, the Chillagoe (N.Q.) offshoot, made
£5743 profit in the past year; this included estimated
value of ore added to roasting heaps, £3415. Total ore
produced was 13,056 tons; so profit was Bs. 9d. per ton.
Ohillagoe Cos. does this co.’s smelting ; and as Chillagoe
owns one-fifth of its stock, and to a great extent runs the
co., a lot of people have been wanting to know what sort
of a slice Ohillagoe was cutting off for itself. Apparently
it is a pretty large slice. The ore sent to snnelters
yielded 173 tons copper, 999 J tons lead, and 154,7390 z.
silver. This should have been worth, gross, about
£43,000, on past year’s average prices. Mungana got
£22,247; so apparently they about divide the proceeds—the
co. which supplies and mines and roasts the ore gets half
net, and the co. which smelts the ore (and the Chillagoe
wants the Mungana’s ore badly) takes the other half.
Chillagoe, besides holding, as vendor, 100,000 Mungana
shares, also gave its own debenture-holders a lien over
the whole property ; at least the Mungana Cos. took the
property with the lien on it. Chillagoe Cos., of course,
undertook to indemnify Mungana ; but if Chillagoe snuffs
out, the indemnity will most likely snuff out too. One
crowd argues from this that Mungana’s business is to
prop up Ohillagoe, and that it doesn’t matter how much
Chillagoe charges for smelting. Another crowd says it’s
Mungana’s business to get in out of the wet as
fast as it can, and let Chillagoe take care of
itself—to root the ore out, and sell it, with all
possible speed and on the best possible terms, so that if
the debenture-holders do take possession they will only
find the remnants of a mine. The only hole in that
scheme, which looks the better of the two, is that it may
hurry on the time when J. Bull’s bailiff will look in. -
Whichever way you view it, it’s an awkward place to get
out of, and the co. that takes over the next mine with
another co.’s debenture-lien over it will have to be a
bright green.
• • *
Manager Rodda, of Mungana, has made an
estimate of that mine’s reserves. Admitting that the
thing can’t be done accurately, on account of the great
irregularity of the bodies, he puts it down at 20,000 tons
—only 18 months’ supply at recent rate of extraction.
What is underfoot can only be guessed at, though
indications are certainly good; but there is proof
that Mungana has been worked beyond its capacity, in
the interests probably of the Chillagoe smelters, and the
knocking-off of production didn’t occur too soon. Most of
the men who have been put off have gone tin-getting on
their own account.

North Queensland copper discoveries are not
finished yet. Latest is credited to a stockman on Car-
pentaria Downs, who has struck something 10 miles from
Einasleigh, on the Copperfield River, and those interested
urge that it rivals O.K. Bananaland papers print that
discoverer has been offered £2OO and a quarter interest
for the show by the Einasleigh Cos., which is probably
bunkum, for said co. has as much copper-mine as it can
hold at present. It would probably pay, the stockman a
fair sum if he could discover a railway 10 miles from the
co.’s freehold. That’s what it wants —more railway, not
more mine.

Wolfram is now quoted at approximately £55
per ton for 70 per cent, material, a 50 per cent, fall inside
of 12 months. Under present market conditions the metal
quotations will always be an approximation, and very
uncertain at that. The best of the North Queensland
wolfram getters have, in years gone by, made the business
pay with the market under £3O. One effect of the fall
from £llO per ton to £55 has been the sorting out of the
spielers from the miners. During the little boom of last
year Wolfram Camp carried about 600 men ; to-day less
than 300 are there trying to make an honest living. Con-
sequently it is estimated that about 200 spielers are now
loose in N.Q., each bent on taking another man’s living.
The other 100 men are honest but unfortunate. An attempt
at systematic work is now possible on Wolfram Camp,
although the necessity for keeping the product under
lock and key still prevails.

“ Redoubt ” writes : “ Bulletin (5/10/’OS) com-
ments on the O.K. arrangement with ex-manager Gibb
sound right; but, in effect, an agreement which provides for
a salary andjno interest inprofits mayprove more disastrous
to a co. than a percentage of profits-cwm-salary appoint-
ment. Where the mine or the works form an extraordi-
nary proposition, success does not depend upon the agree-
ment ;it depends upon the man. The interest-in-profits
manager may spoil your mine in making - big profits
quickly, but you’ve got the profits to go on with. The
manager without an interest has an equal opportunity of
making cash by Stock Exchange operations. He, too,
may decide to root the stuff out and take his profit with
bulls. There’s danger, however, when he ‘mucks’ the
mine and gathers in his rake-off with the bears. Then
the co. hasn’t any profits to go on with. It may be urged
that the ‘ interest ’ man has similar opportunities for
market operations. Asa bull, yes ; but that means
profits for the shareholders. Asa bear, no ; for then he
sacrifices his percentage. I’m certain that The Bulletin
could name many good Broken Hill and Westralian mines
that were ‘ mucked ’ by men vvho were not conceded a
percentage of profits. In North Queensland, above all
places, the principle of giving a manager an interest in
the profits is good; but be careful to appoint the
right man, otherwise all principles will find their way to
the slag dump. North of the Capricorn no money means
no morals. Assuming that Gibb carried out his metallur-
gical operations satisfactorily, and nobody has urged yet
that he failed to do that, then £3OOO per annum was not
too big a remuneration. Those who know what it is pos-
sible to lose at O.K. in smelting will scorn the £BOO per
annum now offered by the co. The board of directors
will doubtless receive hundreds of applications for the
billet, and the chances are they’ll secure a man whose
metallurgical losses will amount to four times the salary
and percentage they paid Gibb. And the chances also are
that they’ll never know anything about those losses,
which will be a good thing for their peace of mind.”
All of which doesn’t affect the proposition that
you can’t gauge the value of a mining man’s 12-months’
work by the profits he makes in that 12 months ; and
that settles payment by immediate results. In this O.K.
case Gibb didn’t know how long he would be at the mine.
He could only be reasonably sure of this year. As it
turned out, he has gone before the end of the year.
Therefore the percentage would have spurred most men,
even if it didn’t spur Gibb, to root out the st uff and show
big profits. Probably, in doing that, development work
was neglected; and there may be a serious slump pre-
sently in output. Possibly also money which ought to
have been put into plant, to reduce costs and so increase
profits next year, and the year after that, has been paid in
dividends. This may not have happened in Gibb’s case ;
but there is the tendency. “ Redoubt ” says that even if
the percentage man does increase the momentary profits
and act as a bull agent, the shareholders make money. Yes,
by passing some of their shares on to people who get in at
bull prices. Then when the slump comes, and the undeve-
loped mine with the eyes picked out can only pay decimal
6 per cent, or so, the new lot of shareholders want to
know what the country is coming to when the working
man is so rapacious that he won’t allow capital to earn
more than a decimal 6 per cent, dividend.

Stated now that all this recent snapping-up of
Broken Hill zinc-tailings dumps lias been on behalf of a
syndicate which will blossom out in a few days into a co.
with a Melbourne registration and a £350,000 capital; but
the public won’t be let in—just yet, anyhow. Bewick,
Moreing and Cos., Lionel Robinson, the Baillieus, and
others are said to be the people ; and David Syme is sup-
posed to have some siller in it. Well, this is better than
a German-Belgian combine, anyhow.
* * • *
Bewick, Moreing and Cos. will manage the new
Zinc Corporation at Broken Hill; directors will be Hert-
zig and Hoover (of B.M.’s staff), H. J. Daly, W. L. Baillieu
(who has been business-managing the deals with the
Broken Hill co. ’s), and W. Clark (London). W. E. Simpson,
lately of Kalgoorlie, will be works manager at B. Hill. Cos.
will see how the Continental buyers treat it in the
matter of offers for zinc concentrates before going into
the business of spelter-production ; at present, its inten-
tion is to turn out only concentrates. Australia will
therefore have to look to the B.H. Prop, to try and put
the business of zinc-production on its legs ; and that is
the real labor-employing industry that Australia needs to
encourage. The business which the new co. proposes to
go in for amounts to very little more than the export of
raw material.
• * « •
Broken Hill Prop, is getting to work on its zinc
‘‘tailings” in a big way. In the past four weeks it
handled 19,700 tons of stuff, producing 5700 tons of zinc
concentrates by the acid process. Cos. is producing its
own sulphuric acid. At Port Pirie things are being got
ready for the zinc-distilling' plant ; so far, all the concen-
trates realised have been sold to European smelters. On
trucks at Broken Hill these zinc concentrates are reckoned
to be worth £2 per ton ; silver-lead concentrates, intrin-
sically worth far less, are valued, on the average, at £6.
The difference lies partly in the heavier cost of extracting
the zinc, partly in the fact that there is practically no
competition for purchase of zinc concentrates.
Broken Hill Junction has had little luck as yet
in its new burst of prospecting vigor—so far as a mining
co. ever can be vigorous on calls. It is working in some
fair-sized ore-bodies at the deepest points (800 ft. or there-
about), but they are mixed with rhodonite ; and that’s
saying about the worst that can be said for any Barrier
sulphides. There is little doubt this erratic co. will come
again some time, but there is no telling when. The Junc-
tion isn’t a mine ; it’s a game of poker.

Creep in the Sulphide Corporation mine spoiled
the look of the Broken Hill metal-export figures for the
past quarter: April-June, £500,982 ; July-September,
£445,190; and the reduction occurred in spite of some-
what larger zinc output. But so far, though zinc is so
much talked of, that metal isn’t worth very much to the
Barrier co.’s. Local values of various products for past
six months have been :
Tonnage. Value.
Silver-lead Concentrates .. 125,514 £760,148
„ Slimes.. .. .. 65,880 79,237

The tin comes from Euriowie, into which field, 14 years
ago, some big Broken Hill mining men put a pot of
money. They left it there ; and, though there is tin all
over the country, that well-remembered frost keeps
people off Euriowie and the neighboring Waukaroo even
during the present tin-boom. Main troubles are that the
lodes are extremely irregular, water is scarce, and most
of the tin occurs in connection with mica, which makes
separation difficult. Also there isn’t as much tin as there
appears to be ; many an old-time show was floated on the
strength of tourmaline—“ new-chum’s tin.”

A correspondent swears to this variant of an old
gag :—The newspaper yarns about the fabulous price of
radium, and the possibility of extracting it from pitch-
blende, led to a West o’ Darling (N.S.W.) syndicate being
formed the other day. A traveller brought in a pocketful
of the stuff ; and all the local experts knew it was pitch-
blende all right. The syndicate had several drinks on the
strength of its prospects, and sent the stuff on to Sydney
to know how many millions a ton it would go. Then the
Mines Department met an old friend; and when the
syndicate got its report it used bad language about
marsupials in general.

Re the beginnings of Coppabella (N.S.W.).
Quotations were recently made from ancient Mines
Department’s reports to show that the field was first tried
over 20 years ago. Another correspondent reported that
the test parcel of ore came from Mt. Gifford. R. Irving,
present holder of latter claim, writes that a previous
holder, Butler, took out three or five tons, which went
17oz. silver, 13dwt. gold, lead not known. “ Lead must,
however, have been fairly good,” he writes, “as the
lowest assay we have got is 21 p.c. ; assays made, by the
way, for home consumption, not export. As for the old-
time warden’s 25ft. lode—well, we haven’t got it. But
still we don’t need to hang on to Coppabella’s tail; and
we are going to let Cockle Creek speak for us pretty
soon.” Five tons of hand-dressed ore have been bagged
for dispatch.

North End G.M., Kalgoorlie, in which Adelaide
people are interested, is surely riding for a fall. Mine is
being equipped with a 15 head mill, much of which is
little better than scrap iron ; and the boilers are two
26ft. ancient Cornish memorials from the Bank of England
claim. Mine has proved pretty good so far, and may be
right, but above gives an idea of how it is being handled.

Some strange things have happened as the
result of Bendigo’s old objections to the surveyor. One
shaft put down 3200 ft, and hauling good dividends most
of the time, was found, when properly surveyed, a couple
of years ago, to be 73ft. shorter than everyone
supposed, and to be lift. 6in. out of plumb.
When the Victoria Quartz and Lansell’s 180
were connected at about 3000 ft. no survey was made,
and no course for the drives plotted out. They simply
tunpelled on from both mines, and hoped to meet. They
passed each other, and for weeks each party could hear
the tapping of the other’s drills, but could not strike the
line. The connecting drive is, needless to say, a dog-leg.
The fact is the mines are managed by the directors. The
nominal managers are unscientific shift-bosses, engine-
drivers glorified into mine managers by the experience
certificate under the Victorian Act. Lansell, or Mueller,
or Atkinson, or Dyason (sure to be one of the four) drives
up to the mine in the morning. The nominal manager
makes his report, and the boss director, who is often a
speculator but never a mining expert, gives his orders.
The method of management was right enough when the
mines were comparatively shallow and the gold was
plentiful. But mining in Bendigo now is another sort of
proposition. The men who fuddled shafts down 1000 ft.
are not competent to run a show which lies 4000 ft. below
the surface. Mistakes are dear at that depth. It needs
a trained expert mining engineer to get the best out of
such a mine. Such men will promptly knock on the
head all the out of date methods now in use. Big shafts,
cool levels, good air, scientific haulage, and probably im-
proved methods of treatment will come in. At present
(it is a nasty lump to swallow, but it’s true), almost
if not actually the best-worked mine on the field
is the Victoria Proprietary, and it is the only Bull-
owned mine on Bendigo. There are no shares in
Australia. There are no directors buzzing round the
mine to “advise”; Henry Y. North, general manager,
has a free hand. They are turning out 200 ounces a week,
and by keeping exploration work ahead of daily require-
ments have years of stuff in sight. A year ago the Pro-
prietary was burnt out—not a stick left standing. Yet
work has been in full swing since May, and nearly 5000 oz.
of gold won to repair the damage. A field where the
average wage of the mine manager is only £3 10s. and £4
a week isn’t going to be worked on scientific lines.

Mines around Donnelly’s Creek ('Vic.) make
little progress, which is as much the fault of Collins-
street management as of the mines. Several co.’s and
parties have tackled the Morning Star ; early-daygougers
left plenty of hard ground going down, but not much
gold in a small vein. Present co. put in a winch to sink
the shaft, and is also the proud owner of a light 3-head
dolly-pot driven by a tremendous iron water-wheel.
Crinoline Extended has the makings of a little mine ; but
15dwt. stone has to be carted three-quarters of a mile to
an ineffective battery. Though the co. is said to have
bought a 10-head mill of its own, there is no sign
of it turning up. Best-worked show in the neighborhood
is the Coronation ; that little syndicate’s success ought to
be a lesson to Collins-street “ mining ” men.

Long Tunnel Extended (Vic.), after its 18 months’
spell from dividends, sees the end of the new works in
sight; and the first of the new series of divs. should
happen next month. Co.’s current account is in credit,

it is wanted.

A stinging report on Lyell Consols (Tas.) finance
has been made by accountant Densham, appointed as the re-
sult of last month’s stormy meeting in Melbourne. In May,
. 1902, the directors of this Crotty-Lonergan float reported :
—“ It is estimated that £4OO will be sufficient to bring
the mine to the productive stage, and that £IOOO would
provide the necessary treatment plant.” The £I4OO
which was going to put the co. on its feet has been sub-
scribed—£l43B, in fact—and this is what has happened to
it, according to Densham’s report :
Receipts.
Cash, May, 1902 .. £01
Calls since .. ..1226
Forfeited shares .. 212
£1499
Expenditure.
Wages £195
Lease rents, &c 103
Directors’fees .. .. 616
Manager and office rent 347
Travelling 200
Petty cash, &c 61
Advances, &c. .. .. 61
Cash in hand .. .. 16
£1499
Mine wages, £195 ; other expenses (and not so much as a
wheelbarrow bought), £I2BB. But that isn’t all. There
are liabilities of £955, of which £551 is for directors’fees
and £69 for manager’s salary. In the published balance-
sheet, these amounts are hidden in the item “ Sundry
Creditors.” Three calls have been made—and that is the
sort of run shareholders have had for their money. Capi-
tal account, the auditor reports, includes the entry
“ Unpaid calls, £94 ” ; and it is explained that some share-
holders didn’t want their shares forfeited, so the directors
protected them—protected some holders’ shares, and sold
those of others. It is to be hoped such shareholders will
recognise the rare consideration shown by the directors,
for every call unpaid was so much money out of their own
pockets.

The case of the Lyell Consols ought to help
Minister Moore to put his new Mining Bill through
N.S.W. Parliament flying. That Bill gives practically
unlimited exemption from labor conditions (simplifies,
in short, this Lyell Consols sort of thing); and Sydney
Telegraph says that it will consequently be a great thing
for the genuine miner. Certainly. Genuine miner, £195 ;
directors, manager, travelling expenses, &e., £I2BB (and a
lot more owing). The advantage to the genuine miner,
and the mining industry, are obvious enough for even the
D.T. to notice them.
Zeehan (Tas.) is ripping out its ore, and making
use of the good metal markets ; last month’s output was
the second highest on record : 6857 tons, valued at £23,025
net. Chief contributors—Argent, £8382 ; Montana, £2126 ;
Tasmanian Copper Co.'s, £1340; North Farrell, £1200;
Florence, £1077 ; Comet, £894. When it looks at the
price of metals and sees the chance it is missing how does
the Hercules Cos. feel? It locked its men out and now
hasn’t the moral courage to own that conditions have
changed, and to invite the men back. Why don’t the
shareholders take a hand ?

“RayX.” : People were probably fools who
bought into Tasmanian tin stuff at boom prices; but
there’s no earthly reason why they should play into the
hands of the bear raiders now. And there undoubtedly
is a bear raid. Many so-called “ sales ” are from one bear
to another; and it is merely the seller, who accepts these
prices and follows the bear lead, who is sold. The bearing
ring is a strong one, and will make a good fight before it
is squeezed out.' Recent trouble in Briseis Extended and
Gladstone has played right into the hands of this crowd.
The Extended trouble was in the first place an error of
judgment on the part of the manager, and in the second
a want of moral courage on the part of Paul Northey or
somebody in not making the shortage public as soon as it
was known. It was evidently thought that the shortage
could be made up later on, without giving the bears a
chance. From one point of view it would have been
better for the public had they succeeded in this ; but too
many got to know, and their hands were forced. The
mine is paying .well at present, anyhow ; the next
(third) clean-up will be a big one ; and at least
half a dozen more are in sight, after that. . There is
more than the subscribed capital in view, at any
rate (which cannot be said of the Briseis itself);
after that the future of the mine depends on the way the
river flats turn out, and they have never been properly
bored. Gladstone mess is really due to personal differ-
ences between dredge-master Ryan and Grayson. Ryan
apparently let his feelings run away with, him, and has
contradicted himself. Personally, despite his letter in
ArguS of Oct. 11th, I feel sure he believes in the. future
of the mine. Can he deny that lie advised his friends to
that effect a few days ago ? As Payne, the M.L. dredging
expert saj's, with a few alterations the plant will work all
right; and when they get out into the wash dirt the mine
will be proved one way or the other. Bulk of shares are
strongly held ; and it will be far the best for those who
bought at high prices to wait.

’ Totals .; .. £71,748 £76,948
Balance of Assets .. .. £79,248 £67,681
The co. does not disclose its profits except at the end of
the year. Last year, the profit from the co.’s works and
mines was £80,958 ; but the mine fire cost £78,368, and
after providing for this and other expenses, the net
profit, before charging depreciation, was reduced to £5lB.
Output this year (2381 tons fine copper for the first six
months) has been a little less than it was in 1904, but
metal prices have been good ; and the fact that the over-
draft has, notwithstanding circumstances, run up from
£38,458 to £52,162, is accounted for by continuous heavy
outlay on new works, including an expensive electric
pumping installation at Wallaroo. Anew shaft has also
been called for. Position, summed up, is about as
follows : At the end of 1902 there was a surplus of liquid
assets of £65,309, while the present surplus is very
near the same figure—£66,6Bl. Meantime £16,000 has
been paid in divs. (two distributions of 2£ per cent,
each). Therefore, besides paying £16,000 in divs., the
mines in the past 21 years, hampered though they were as
to production, have paid out of current profit for the
whole of the heavy expenses in connection, first with the
fire and then with the remodelling of the plant. Con-
sidering the age of the mines, and that the cream was
long ago skimmed from them, the co. has done remark-
ably well; and divs. have just hove in sight again. They
will be small at first, because the co. has, during its
troubles, been letting development work slide; and that
will call for attention when all the plant is running.

W. H. Matthews is about tired of the job of
Inspector of Mines in S. Aus., and his resignation may be
looked for any day. Already the billet is being canvassed ;
Frank George, who is something of an explorer as well as
a geologist, and E. L. Grundy, manager of the State bat-
teries at Mt. Torrens and Petersburg, are in the running.
Government Geologist Brown will back up George;
Grundy has his official friends, too. Matthews, an old
Bendigo manager, used to run in double harness with
Zeb. Lane (also Bendigo-trained) in the early days of the
Barrier silver field. Matthews was the bigger man of the
two at that time, and had what was reckoned the bigger
mine, the Round Hill. Matthews was president of the
Mine Managers’ Association ; Lane, secretary. Lane
managed the North. Then, while Matthews was
struggling to find ore in Round Hill—a worse
job than hunting for a toothpick in a haystack—
Lane moved on to Block 14, which turned out a good
mine and paid many divs. Matthews failed, because his
mine was no good, and took a poor job in S. Australia ;
Zeb. Lane streaked for the West, with the reputation that
a good mine had made for him, stumbled on to the
Boulder, and. piled up money. It was Joe Cook, wasn’t
it, who said there’s no such thing as luck.

One of Melbourne’s money-lending sharks was
held over the stove lately by Judge Eagleson. He had
lent a woman £l2 in May, ’O4. She had repaid £4, but
nevertheless she was said to still owe £23 2s. 6d. In
July, ’OS, the shark seized the debtor’s furniture, proved
to be worth about £6O ; whereupon the worm turned, and
sued for £99 damages for trespass and illegal seizure.
His Honor, after observing that the rate of interest
worked out at 260 per cent., told the Ikey he seemed to
be the father of all cormorants and a most insatiable
shark, against whose practices it was his Honor’s duty to
set his face sternly. He gave judgment for £54 10s. 10d.,
with costs. Also, he intimated his intention of forward-
ing his notes on the case to the Attorney-General as a
piece of interesting literature.
The hugely-inflated Millar’s Karri and Jarrah
Cos. has given its Bull shareholders another bad year.
Authorised capital is £1,400.000 ; and there is a large
amount of debenture stock. New co. paid the old co.’s
(which it absorbed) £532,116 in preference shares, £703,034
in ordinary shares, and £353,700 in debenture stock.
Ordinary shares have not drawn a penny dividend in
three years ; and for past year the preference shares
(6 per cent, cumulative preference) only get half their
dividend. The report is mostly, to the effect that Wes*
tralian labor conditions make a, better showing impossible.
Nothing is said with regard to the booming and market,
rigging which led to the co, being capitalised at its
present absurd figure.

Tumut (N.S.W.) tobacco-growers, are now ex-
periencing one of the might-have-been-expected results of
the Tobacco Trust’s operations. At the beginning of the
season agents drifted around, talked smoothly to all and
sundry, and off-handedly mentioned 7d. to Bd. a lb, as a
price for a special variety of fire-cured tobacco leaf. Many
growers thereupon put in an excess crop, built expensive
drying sheds and awaited thebig cheques that were to come.
Now they find the Trust’s price ranges from 2d, to Bd. a
lb,, the latter for a very few scarce lots. As regards the
great bulk—well, the Trust is sorry, but it is only a two-
penny variety. And as there is practically no compe-
tition now there is no appeal. Any tobacco is twopenny
if the Trust likes to say it is.

A DIRE PERIL.
MISS PRUE (to solicitor): “ You're a nasty im-
pudent old man, and if you don't go at once
I shall loose the dog.”
A venturesome woman tourist, who, not
long ago, travelled down the wet West Coast oi
Maoriland from Hokitika to the beautiful Franz
Joset glacier, has some quaint tales to tell of the
things that she heard and the sights she saw
in that over-moist region, where the children,
nb is popularly alleged, are born web-footed.
Typical of the queer things of “ The Coast,” was
a bush-hut at the mouth of the Kallery Gorge,
near the foot of the Franz Josef iceflow. The
hog-backed roof of the picturesque old whare,
°' v hy an equally picturesque and dilapidated
gold-fossicker, had been covered with sods and
turf, presumably to make it cool in summer and
warm in winter, just as the Uriwera Maoris heap
up the earth around their bark-roofed dwellings.
Ihe ancient hovel was overgrown with long grass,
and on the top the proprietor had his little kitchen
garden. The old man was found squatting on the
roof, putting in some strawberry plants for the
summer ! Last season, he said, he had a fine
crop of peas in the same place.

“ Millewa ” ; What is there in the gene-
alogy of the greyhound which makes him so dis-
tinctly no gentleman ? The cleaner his breed the
more apparent his lack of candor, and hi§ nefarious
designs, upon the warmed-up chop and the
mysterious sausage. So, too, as long as he is the
pursuer, he will advance boldly upon an enemy
the size of a suburban terrace, while the smallest
sprat of a pugnacious terrier puts him to flight.
If it can be explained, Fd like to know, for at
present he strikes me mostly as a handy exempli-
fication of the ordinary meaning of the obscure
Australian term “cow.”

“ F re travelling pigs :
In eastern Gippsland, and in parts of the north-eastern
district of Victoria, where the railway is anything from 60
to 150 miles away, the farmer who goes in for pig-raising
has some trouble in marketing the animals. The pig is a
poor animal on the road. He won’t travel at all in hot
weather ; and in cool weather he is very slow, and needs
a lot of attention. But it is possible to grow pigs so
cheaply in these districts that the trouble of getting them
to market is worth overcoming. They are rough, well-
grown stores, brought up on maize or pumpkins, or both,
xhe fust pumpkin patch I struck had such a close resem-
biance to a flock of sheep that I didn’t discover my error
until quite close to it. It was a big pig-farm, away east
from Wodonga. The farmer had 500 hogs, which he fed
entirely on pumpkin and grass. Every morning and even-
ing a few dozen of the huge pumpkins were knocked to
pieces with a mallet, and were then devoured by the
animals.
When the pigs are driven to market, they are accom-
panied by one or two large waggons, piled full of pump-
kins. Usually, half-a-dozen farmers combine for a trip.
At the close of the day a good watering place is selected,
and two or three dozen pumpkins are taken off the wag-
gon and smashed up. After eating these the pigs settle
down for the night. They are given a similar feed in the
morning. The trip may last a fortnight or three weeks,
but it is seldom that any of the stock are lost. After
trucking’ the pig's at the railway station, the waggon is
loaded with rations and other necessaries, and the drovers
return home.
Down Orbost way, near the Snowy River, farmers bring
in pigs from as far as 60 miles out to Bairnsdale, in the
same way, only they use maize instead of pumpkins. In
order to encourage the hog-infantry a small hole is cut in
one of the bags of maize, and there is a constant trickle of
grain along the road. The pigs pick this up as cleanly as
hens, and don’t appear to notice the journey so much.
Some of these pig-raisers do very well at the game of
elevating the swine, as the expenses are small. I was
shown one farmer who was said to be clearing £5OO a year
from his pigs alone. He had some 80 acres of pumpkins
and maize, and declared that a mixture of the two formed
the best hog-victual in the world.

“ Cross-Nibs ” : He came in at the tail-end
of a Darling shower, conveying a goodly portion
of the Never-Never country about his person. We
invited him to convert it into thin mud, and then
secure a knife and fork. After the irrigation
business, we discovered he was a Greek, and 10
minutes from depositing his
dungaree-clad legs under
the table, he had fixed be-
tween his hoops everything
edible. Then he suggested
“More-a,” and we advised
an interview with Ah Fat,
the curry-builder ; but that
oblique-eyed pagan exploded
into a fearsome assortment
of Chinky curses. Next day
the boss made the descend-
ant of Agamemnon offsider
to Ginger Mick, who had a
contract to dispatch 50 rams
of un9ertain age. They
arrived' at the scene of
carnage, and Ginger was
soon surrounded with mori-
bund mutton. “ Leg away,
•you blanky squib,” he
yelled to Spiridos. “Aa-
ah—you poomp ’eem lika the
booleelc ? ” gurgled the Dago
as he pushed his capacious
boot into the flank of a de-
parted ram. Mi#k electrified
the atmosphere with un-
holy mulga eloquence before
he asked the offsider to ob-
serve closely his scientific
method of peeling off a jum-
buck’s rind. Steeling his
lethal weapon, he stooped
over his work, while the
Greek gazed dreamily on.
Up on the gambrel, pelt off,
and a rip to the brisket-
then Spirido shrieked,
“ Larstrikiinadi ! he killa
me dead-a ! ” as he lay on
his back, disturbing the
oxygen diligently with his
feet and struggling hope-
lessly with the abdominal
viscera of the ram that Mick
had cast violently behind him. Spirido squirmed
■ and grunted in his vain endeavors to free himself
of his gory decorations, till Michael came and re-
leased him.'“ Oh, garabloomi! mia berairi abusta,”
moaned the Greek, and rising to his feet, he fled
incontinently into the scrub, and was seen no more
in the neighborhood.

“ Xerxes ” : Here’s a wrinkle for fisher-

hard to get. Well, under cow-manure, bits of

found quite close to the surface of the ground,
even in the driest and hardest of hard-baked earth.
As soon as*the sun «rises down they go out of
reach, and even the most energetic prayers of a
good Christian won’t bring them up again till
next night.

A bird of
which no one

was recently
found by a grazier
at KatandraNorth

some tufts of
swampy grass on
his property. The

is described as being
about the size of an
Indian runner duck;
plumage of mottled
black, but neck feath-
era freely silvered ;
beak like a shag and
crest like a peacock;
feet webbed, but the bird seemed to shove itself
along without using them. It attacked the
finder’s horse, but being placed in a dam remained
there. [Does this mean that it drowned and re-
mained dead or that it floated and remained
swimming ?- Ed. B.j

“ P.M.” : Sparrows are among the ’cutest
of birds. The poisoned wheat, scattered in various
places for their destruction, they evade. A cocky
in N. W. Victoria lately got ahead of them for a
time. He built on his chooks’ feeding-ground a
small enclosure of netting, ten feet high. He
threw the fowls’ feed round the netting outside,
and poisoned wheat inside. The sparrows didn’t
drop to the difference at first, and numbers fell
victims. The remainder left the farm for the
good of their health, and the Sparrow Parliament
passed a Bill to tbe effect that in future they
would feed along with the chooks, and avoid any
injurious differentiation of victuals.

“D. 8.”: What does the Australian
water-tortoise exist on ? Ikn jw of one that has
been in an Bxlo underground tank for nearly 12
months. There is no vegetation of any kind in
the tank, and insect-life, so far as the naked eye
can discern, is absent; still the reptile seems as
lively as when he was put there. He is a very
weather-wise creature. When it is fine, he is
nowhere to be seen ; if rain is hanging about, he
floats about on the surface till the weather settles.

“M.A.0.U.”: The death adder is com-
mon here (Cape York), especially in the months
of Feb., March, and April. It is nocturnal in its
habits, and is very rarely to be observed in action
by day. My experience of adders permits me to
say that they are not very deadly throughout the
year, but at certain periods they may prove so.
In the last 12 years I have witnessed four cases of
bite —one of a dog, the rest of niggers. All
pulled through, though with much agony and
with loss of sight whilst ill. The brown snake is,
without doubt, our most deadly snake. It has a
large head, grows as long as 15ft., and is in color
from a yellowish rusty brown to a dark chocolate,
and very vicious.

“ Lex,” from Maoriland :
We had a good many Maori clients, amongst them a
certain rich Maori woman, Amaria Tanere by name. She
was a gay spark from the backblocks. Though she could
speak English very well, she always preferred to come to
town with her interpreter. She usually brought one of
her own race to act in this capacity; and nearly every
time she came she brought a different interpreter. At
last, when she came into the office with the eleventh dif-
ferent and separate Maori buck, I said, “ That your hus-
band, Amaria?” “ Yes,” she said, “he my step-husby.”
And she didn’t look as if she suspected herself of being
humorous, either.

Some men have a lot of luck ; some none
at all. Harry was a miner, and married. His
mate, Tom, was single, and lived near in a hut.
Tom was on day shift; Harry on night shift.
After a drink or two, one cold, black, winter’s
night, Harry struck out in the darkness somewhat
unsteadily for the mine, about three miles away.
After a mile or so, he bent down his head to light
his pipe, turning round as he struck the match to
dodge the wind. He ambled on again, quite for-
getting that he was facing the wrong way, and, in
a while, to his utter amazement, instead of reach-
ing the claim he found himself outside his own
door. “Too late to go back,” he muttered.
“Won’t the missus explode ! Hang the beer ! ”
He went round the back, and, striking a match
at the door, proceeded to excuse himself.
But he stopped, and the match burnt to his
fingers in a deathlike silence. .Then in the dark-
ness came a muffled scream, and some thuds, and
Tom landed on his ear in the yard, followed by
Harry’s missus. Then a door slammed, and it has
remained shut ever since.
“ Melroyd ” : Said the hairy man with the
brown-paper swag and empty treacle tin : “’Taint

all ’is time to git tucker. One time I used to be
fair starvin’ f’r weeks, but I’m doin’ pretty well
j ust now. Y’see when I comes across a ’ouse with
no blokes about I goes in and puts on a savage
glare, an’ tells the woman in charge that I’m
‘John the Baptist,’ or something of that sort, an’
that I want something to eat. O’ course she
thinks me a dangerous loonertic an’ gives me a
big ’and-out to git rid o’ me. Yes, I git a few
knock-backs now an’ agin. One day I went into
a ’ouse and told th’ lady I wuz th’ Pope. ‘ That’s
funny,’ says she, ‘l’ve got a relation of yours
here.’ An’ with that she sings out ‘Leo,’ an’
around th’ corner rushes a bloodthirsty mongrel.
I raced ’im to th’ gate, but ’e caught me an’
knocked me furniture about terrible. W’y I
couldn’t sit in me cosy corner f’r weeks after-
wards.” Aud the hairy man sighed and wiped
his eyes wPk his whiskers.

“Kiro”: About bush people’s ways of
passing time. Once struck a lonely hut which
seemed deserted. Walked inside and found the
owner standing on his head in a corner, and staring
at a watch in his hands. I waited for 10 minutes,
and when he got his understandings underneath
him he said he often used to stand on his head to
pass the time. “ Just done 53 minutes 4|sec.” he
asserted. “Record?” I inquired. “Nurgh!
Wunce did 57min. ! ”

“ Falder ” : “ Prooshan ” (B. 28/9/’O5)

another little blue-and-yellow woollen mat, on the
same table as the album he writes about. The
waxen greengrocery generally breaks the ice, the
album only comes in when things are pretty well
settled. Jim doesn’t dare to be familiar with the
album till he has discussed whether the white
round boil with the puce-pink bas-relief is an
apricot or an orange, and has otherwise praised
that work of ignorance. About here, they have
taken to those gaudy ships in bottles so popular
with the Dago fish-polluters; and the first few
evenings are mostly whiled away speculating as
to the ship’s chance of exit, leaving an unblemished
bottle behind it. Up the line, towards Camden,
they ignore all these things, and court by discuss-
ing Cow.
A RETROSPECT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Eftsoons 1 and eke gramercy I*—yea, how times and
things do change
As the years, e’er marching onward, bring conditions new
and strange—
Things the old hands never dreamed of in the greenhide
days gone by,
When we drove to church in bullock-drays, and dined on
pumpkin pie,
Likewise the doughsome damper baked beneath the ashes
hot,
Or scooped the pounded ’taters from an iron three-leggM
pot !
When our dwellings were of slab and bark, our furniture
of “ box ”
Gin-cases, tea-chests, liquor-kegs—and when we wore no
socks t
And used the light of other days—a pannikin of slush,
In other words, of tallow—in the centre was a rush,
Or a splinter wrapped in cotton—oh, the splutter and the
spurt
That we then evoked from tallow, aided by a piece of
shirt!
When we thought not of the morrow, and no cause we
had to moan,
For, although we owned but little, yet that little was our
own.
But I’ll draw the ’skeeter-curtain o’er those rugged days
of yore,
AVhen we’d lots of junk and damper, and we cared not
what we wore;
When a man could face his fellows—he was somehow that
way built—
And he’d never hear the saying, “ That cove’s mortgaged
to the hilt! ”
What a change—gadzooks ! —now cometh o’er the spirit
of our dream,
In this age of sham and shoddy—in these vap’rous days of
steam—
When the shadow, not the substance, all seem eagerly to
chase,
Often falling- by the wayside in the turmoil of the race ;
Slab and bark are out of fashion, brick and stone are now
the thing,
And each fellow wants a palace like a sultan or a king ;
lie must have his stylish buggy, with a splendid pair to
match,
Maybe wears a gold-rimmed eyeglass and a fifty-guinea
watch;
Then his togs must be expensive—of the very latest cut—
And he snubs his honest neighbor in the humpy or the
hut!
Though his scholarship’s defective, he adopts some long
words thus :
“ Acti-nommy-dommy-cosus ” and “ tubercu-10-se-us ! ”
He spells o’er the market prices in his local weekly rag,
And when weighing out potatoes always counts, of course,
the bag 1
He has sunk his cash in vanities, and honest labor
shirked,
And his fields have run to thistles, and his farm remains
unworked.
Then—oh (the sigh is bitter !), for the good old vanished
days
Of the barked-roofed huts and dampers, and the sturdy
bullock-drays—
The days of moleskin trousers, and the three-legged iron
pot,
When every man, though humble, never seemed what he
was not.

FAIRFAX & ROBERTS:
The Oldest Jewellery
House in Sydney,
23 Hunter Street,
There is a bright Maori boy at Rotorua
who will rise in the world some d„ ". He narrowly
escaped rising in it very suddenly the other week
—on top of a geyser. In his mother’s front garden
facing the lake there is a constantly-boiling spring,
the family cooking-hole. Young Hone had
watched with interest the public ceremony of
“ soaping ” the geyser Wairoa at Whakarewarewa
to induce a specially big eruption, and he hit upon
the brilliant idea of applying similar treatment to
the old cooking-w/ttw/m in the maternal kuviara-
patch. By some means he procured a bar of soap
from the nearest store without attracting the
storekeeper’s attention, and dumped it into the
ngawha, regardless of the fact that the household
dinner was already there. Presently, the eruption
came; the spring burst out with a thundering
roar and spouted thirty feet into the air—a new
geyser. The dinner ? “ Ask of the winds that far
around” with fragments of pork and potatoes
strewed the beach. And the boy ? The last seen
of him was a small brown study in a cutty sark
sprinting along the shores of Rotorua with an
angry Maori matron, armed with a canoe paddle,
in full sail after him. The poor old ngawha has
been so upset by its undeserved emetic that it has
become an erratic cross between a geyser and a
boiling-pool—not high enough to be the one nor
sedate enough for its old job of boiling pork. The
old lady has lost a steady and reliable kitchen-
spring, and Hone is still hiding in the fern.
The communistic spirit amongst the Maoris
works out in unexpected ways. A Lake Taupo
rangatira (chief), seized with commercial ideas,
recently established a store in one of the principal
settlements of his affectionate tribe, and stocked
iFwith several hundred pounds worth of goods,
calculating that he would secure the whole of the
custom of his feudal retainers and knock the
pakeha storekeeper clean out. He was right; the
tribe rushed their great good chief with orders,
and while the stock lasted the store did a roaring
trade. But when the customers were presented
with their bills they all with one accord smiled
sweetly and said, “ Taihoa, taihoa” (Wait, wait!).
And taihoa it was and will be, for the tribe considers
it would be an insult to their great and benevolent
chief to offer him anything so sordid as money.
“Is he not our father, our Ariki of Arikis, the
descendant of the gods? Money for the heaven-
born son of giants ! Perish the thought.” And
now the tribe is anxiously waiting for the store to
re-open, and the chief is longing for the return of
the good old days when a rangatira was some
pumpkins in the land, and could collect bad debts
from his subjects with a greenstone axe.

“ Falder ” : Be “ Harvey Kay ” about the
Dorrigo rosewood forests (B. 28/9/’O5). Know
every tree on Dorrigo by its pet name. Went
there three years ago with commission to ship un-
limited quantity to Germany at 11s. per 100 ft.
super, in the log, delivered at ship in Sydney.
Grabbed all the rosewood available, then pro-
ceeded to fall and crosscut it ready for the teams,
but found the stuff miserably unsound. It looked
and tapped all right, but even when an appar-
ently sound tree was cut, after a few days it would
“shake ” and open badly. The logs are lying in
the scrub yet. Also tried pit-sawing it, with
much the same result. Then the saw-mills came
in and tackled it, and they fell in over it. So
“ H.K.” can rest easy. I think the unsoundness
is due to the windy, cold situation it grows in
there. Down below on the Bellinger rosewood is
a much better timber.

“ Thurla ” : The plant called “ Old Man ”
by “The Prooshan” (B. 24/7/’O5) could be iden-
tified by any seedman or florist, one should think.
It is a well-known garden plant, with wiry
looking foliage, and a heavy odor when squeezed.
Tomato-vines, planted round fruit trees, we used
to regard as a check to aphides. They may be
worth a trial by the harassed orchardist.

“ Nym ” : I know a man who makes more
drink money than is good for his equilibrium,
by cultivating the fresh-water mussel for bait.
When the Campaspe and the billabongs are low he
shovels out the shell-fish in bagsful, takes them
home, and feeds them up in a tank during
the winter. When the angling season
starts, and for weeks after, he retails
his crop by the dozen to anglers,
as mussels are not procurable
till about February owing
to high-water disadvan-
tages. This worthy also
lays in a supply of worms
during spring in wooden
boxes filled with earth,
and lives an easy exist-
ence during the wormless
summer months by dis-
posing of the wrigglers by
the tinful. Worms were
as scarce as onions, and as
small, last summer, and we
paid a shilling for about half-
a-pint. Ever notice that fish
rarely take the long, soft,
gummy earth-worm found round
lagoons adjacent to their own haunts, and
mussels that come from far-off lagoons are the
most relished by river fish ? Fish have the im-
porters’ instinct.

Lismore, standing some 70 miles from the
mouth of the Richmond River, is perhaps the
clammiest, most flourishing, and, above all,
sneeziest town in N.S.W. It is wonderful the
way people sneeze there, not fitfully, but everlast-
ingly. Even the lawyer pauses in the receipt of
his fee and turns aside to sneeze, and the police-
man who is running after the criminal, and the
criminal who is running away from the policeman
both sneeze as they run.

“I go next week,” said the slant-eyed
cook to the Normanton (Q.) publican. “Whaf-

Sam, gloom? You know Maly, housekeeper?”
“Yes.” “Well, two sit outside my loom evely
ni. Maly, she say, ‘ I likee you too muchee,
Sam.’ Sam say, ‘ I likee you too muchee, Maly.’
Then loud kissee. My countly no kissee. Makee

“ Snell ” : The Gippslander has discovered
another tired man. The tale-bearer and two
mates were out at the far end of a Government
track somewhere in the Cassilis district. They
were on a prospecting expedition, and at sundown
made their camp in a comfortable little niche in
the hill, lighting the fire at the end of a large,
hollow log. They had settled down quite com-
fortably—William had been boiled and tea was
progressing favorably—when suddenly a burst of
blatant profanity arose in the immediate distance.
A large, shaggy human head was sticking out of
the other end of their hollow log, and discharging
curses. “ Hello, mate,” cried the surprised Gipps-
lander, “how did you come there? ” “I was here
afore you was,” shouted the exasperated tenant.
“You put out that crimson fire. It’s somethin’ when
a man can’t take a snooze without runnin’ the risk
o’ bein’ burnt out by a pack o’ dashed larrikins ! ”
They tried to persuade the dosser to withdraw,
but he only cursed the louder, and howled about
his rights as a landlord. He evacuated the pre-
mises when his boots began to burn, and then
fossicked his swag out of some saplings near by,
and started furiously for Bairnsdale to institute
proceedings for trespass and arson, he said.

Down in the wilds of the Buller Bush,
South Island of Maoriland, is a quaint com-
munity of diggers known as “The Lost Tribes.”
The “Tribes” are all Irish, and Seddonites to a
man, and have a “King” of their own, a fierce
and hairy potentate by the name of O’Something,
who claims to be a descendant of one of the forty-
seven ancient Kings of Ireland. The monarch
keeps a bush pub, and exacts heavy tribute
from his loyal subjects. And the stranger who
ventures into the haunts of the “Tribe” quickly
discovers that he must pay his footing like a
rangatira. Report says that when a new arrival
from the outside world sits himself down in the
palace of the King, one of the bare-legged princelets
takes post pn the front verandah and blows
resoundingly on a cow’s-horn bugle. Before the
echoes have died away, long-haired diggers are
seen bursting from the scrub in all directions, and
sprinting like redshanks for the pub. “Sor-r,”
says the King, when the new chum goes out to
wonder at the race of the dungarees, “sor-r, thim’s
the free and indipindent poppylation iv this
prosp’rus town, cornin’ to wa-ait on ye as a
dippytation to ask yer opinion of the disthrict an’
its resources, and to do ye the anner iv dhrinkin’
yer health.” And then the truth sadly dawns
upon that stranger in a lone wild land.

“D.H.R.” : Came across a queer specimen
recently whilst biking from Moree to Bingera
(N.S.W.). Along where the road runs pretty
close to the river bank I noticed a piece of bag
hanging on a gum tree about eight or nine feet
from the ground. Jumped off to investigate.
Found bag to be the curtain to a hollow which had
been burned in the tree. Inside, on a comfortable
trestle bed, a man was asleep, but he woke just as
I was leaving and told me to come in. Then he
talked: “I’m a snake-catcher. I make a good
deal, oh yes ! I send my ‘ crop ’ to Melbourne,
Sydney, and a few to Adelaide. Like to see a
few specimens ?—certainly ! ” And he produced
large glass jars with reptiles of all sorts and sizes
in captivity and anger. He named them all to
me. He had seven death-adders and eleven black
and brown snakes. That night I had the same
sort of dreams that you might have after seeing
Harry Rickards as Macbeth, or Bert Bailey as
Ingomar.

Taupo Maoris are making eloquent appeals
to the Government to cease rearing pakeha fish
(trout, etc.) at Rotorua for the benefit of the
spindle-legged tourist with the eye-glass. “Let
our lake be a sanctuary for the beautiful fish of
our ancestors. _ All the other lakes and streams
are full of this pakeha fish, which destroy our
fish, and we are punished if we kill this pakeha
fish, although the lakes and streams are our own
property.”
“Belah”: Judging by the experiences
recounted in The Bulletin, the sensations of
snakebite, like the effects of ruin, would appear to
be different in different constitutions. In early
spring, when the virus is alleged to be very deadly,
I and two dogs—all moved by the crudest notions
as to the science of attacking reptiles of this type
—got deplorably tangled up in an argument with
a large brown snake. In the excitement I scarcely
felt the prick of the bite on the fleshy part of the
hand. The dog (a fair-sized cattle collie) gave a
sharp whimper, and at once retired from the com-
petition. Walking dejectedly to the nearest bush,
he stood with drooping head for a while, and then
fell forward on to his breast, limply and without
any sign of muscular contraction. He didn’t stir
again. As near as could be guessed in the confu-
sion of the moment, the dog died within about
fifteen minutes of being bitten. In the meantime
I had been ligatured in the usual way, and the
part cut open. For a time there was a sort of
sickly sinking sensation, not unlike that produced
by the local anaesthetic of the dental chair,
and, after that passed, just the irresistible drowsi-
ness which comes to the man who is on the point
of collapse from want of sleep. Then oblivion.
There was no pain, no swelling, no anything
much excepting a desire to let things slide. Medi-
cal aid was available an hour after the bite, and
in three days I was all right. I knew a young
ladv who was bitten on the foot from under the
bath stand by what was afterwards found to be a
tiger snake. The victim felt no pain at all, and
did not know she had been mortally struck. On
dressing and coming out, she complained of feel-
ing very tired and sleepy, and went to bed. In
ten minutes she was asleep—for the last time. On
her death being discovered, the bathroom was
searched, and a lively young tiger snake was found
under the board on which the bather had stood.

Description of a Board of Health in an
Australian State: —
Our Board of Health is properly constituted— i.e., it
and its members have been formally gazetted. It has its
official set of books, which it does not keep, and the
power of levying rates, which it cannot collect. Quarterly
returns have to be forwarded, and aren’t. A Health
Officer has to be appointed, and hasn’t been—the princely
annual stipend of £5 attached to the office not having at-
tracted an application from our local medico, while his
nearest confrere—6o miles away—is equally free from
avarice.
When the Board was first gazetted the Government was
asked for a small grant to put it on its financial feet re-
garding initial expenses—cost of a set of books, &c. The
Government gave £lOO. Thefjoard immediately assembled,
to save time, in the post office. A secretary was appointed
at a monthly salary, and a set of books was ordered.
Thereafter the Board sat regularly every month, dis-
cussed the prospects of the district, signed the secretary’s
cheque, adjourned to the pub, and conscientiously “ did
it in ” until the funds were exhausted. Then it adjourned
sine die, but assembled in haste the following morning by
special convocation of the publican who had cashed the
final cheque. This had been returned marked “N.S.F.”
It is the custom of banks to debit each account with
a few shillings each half-year so as to secure some profit
out of each customer, and this left a pound shortage. A
tarpaulin muster was made, the amount gathered and
paid in, and all interest in sanitary science immediately
evaporated.
Again the harassed Board adjourned sine die, but its
hibernations were rudely disturbed by a summons from
the misguided firm that had supplied the books and
whose account had been overlooked. The Board
thereupon arose and spake through its neck. Although
individually indemnified by statute against vulgar claims
of this nature, still there might be a moral claim, and the
Board was moral, even if harassed, and promised to
collect sufficient rates to pay for the books. Needless to
say, it didn’t collect the rates, and having unsuccessfully
tried a private collection for the last time, it adjourned
to the status quo ante.
The Board’s outlook, however, is hopeful, as there is a
sum of £lOO on the Estimates for next year, and the secre-
tary will make superhuman efforts to secure a resumption
of his salary. Not only will he have the assistance of his
fellow-members, but that of the publican, who has a pull
in more senses than one, and who necessarily takes a
keen interest in the Board’s finance.
AN ANTI-CHINESE MOVEMENT.
The constable declared that Sun Kong War, who is 36
years of age, and a gardener, negligently drove a horse
attached to a cart in George-street West. He motioned
to the Celestial to stop, but the latter drove on, the
vehicle knocking him down as it passed.
CONSTABLE : “ Divil take the fool who arristed
Lionel Terry!"
“ Dave H. R.” : Travelling once in a boat
from Grafton to Sydney, I had for fellow passen-
gers a big-bonneted, blood-and-thunder, black-
browed Salv’army lass and her following. Every
afternoon they took full possession of the cabin,
and indulged in hymns and gestures. The “ cap-
tain ” had some pretensions to beauty had her
bonnet not destroyed it. At one gathering, after
giving her experiences and misdeeds for about an
hour, the inevitable tambourine circulated. A
Chow dropped in half-a-sovereign and spoke :
“ You welly, welly goodee girlee ! You welly ni !
Me come alonga you ! My word ! You makee me
food ! You talkee me plenty. Halleluia ! All my
lother, my sissetah ! ” The mate drove him away
with a swab and stopped the oration.

An’ the mags that’s always watchin’ fer the cornin’ of the

But fr’m Swanston up ter Russell is the on’y place fer me.
All the faces is familiar —you can meet with every ’ook
That you ever ’ave bin vagged with ; yer can see yer

Yer’ll come on old acquaintances in every blessed John,
Or the tarts you useter ’ustle up in Big or Little Lon.
It isn’t fur ter walk ter stake a dollar at the clubs,
An’ all the tips is posted in the winders of the pubs ;
It’s the ’ome of all the clever crowd as ’as no need ter

Fer they give ’em all the up-ter-date conveniences in

Yer can easy git the office fr’m the rats or fr’m the

And the bloke that’s sellin’ peanuts is a ’andy man ter

When you’ve ’ad enough of two-up at th’ Athletic Club

When you’ve bin an’ marked yer ticket, an’ you’ve give

And you’re lookin’ round fer cobbers of the sort you

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Richard Shea died the other day at
Hobart, aged 86. He hauled up shipping signals
at Battery Point flagstaff for 51 years, and claimed
to be the last survivor of the 99th Regiment men
who fought in the Maori war.
G. H. Reid is a funny cuss. He dropped
his engagement to speak at a Sydney population-
wanted meeting to go up to Wyalong to defend a
young man charged with supplying to his girl
medicine “for a certain purpose,” as the daily
newspapers put it.
The new Victorian County Court Judge,
John Burnett Box, comes to the Bench somewhat
late in years. He was called to the Inner Temple
June 6, 1866, and to the Victorian Bar in Decem-
ber, 1869. The salary of his new job is £1250
without pension rights.
Mr. James Greer, the Sydney solicitor
whose law practice dates back to 1850, recently
entered his 74th year. Mr. Greer was one of
three who were once counted the handsomest
men in Sydney, Charles Lett and “Bulli”
Hamilton being the other two.
The death of W. H. Suttor leaves but two
qf the N.S. Wales representatives of the Federal
Convention of 1891 alive—Edmund Barton and
William M'Millan. The others were Parkes,
Abbott, Dibbs and Jennings. The representa-
tives of the other States have hung out much
better. Six of the S.A. lot still survive.
Dan O’Connor leaves for England with his
biographical MS. under his arm first week in
December. This is Dan’s first trip to the Cold
Land since he left Tipperary as a boy in 1847 or
so. He thinks of letting his whiskers cascade
over the front of the lecture platform in the
United States.
An old identity went over lately in the
gerson of Mrs. Morris Asher, of Macleay-street,
ydney, in her 78th year. Morris Asher, who is
now in the eighties, is one of the few remaining
members of what is known as the First Reform
Parliament of N.S. Wales—as a matter of fact it
was the third Parliament. It was elected in 1859,
and four or five of the members still wander on
the face of the earth. Mr. Asher represented the
Hume.
NEW ARRANGEMENT WANTED.
Although the States have now entered upon a long era
of debt conversion no arrangement has been made to
avoid clashing by placing the Commonwealth in control.

Journalist James Frederick Mayger, dead
recently at Deniliquin (N.S.W.), aged 85, was a
native of London, where he was a compositor
and contributed to the papers. He came to Mel-
bourne 50 years ago, and afterwards worked as a
i'ournalist on a Beech worth (Vic.) paper. Then
le put in a spell on the Deniliquin Pastoral
Times, and in 1864 opened up on his own account
by founding the Deniliquin Chronicle, which he
edited until some three years ago. He was a
staunch Protectionist and a vigorous anti-land
monopolist.
Not the least interesting feature about the
debates in the Reps, is the consistent inconsistency
of J. W. M‘Cay. When Reid is resting his
tummy and fatly snoring in bed, M‘Cay acts as
a sort of acting-assistant. deputy Leader of the
Opposition, and gets up and talks against every
Ministerial proposal. Yet had he been given a
little more time when the Reid ship was settling
down, there is no doubt he would have been across
the floor behind Deakin just as emphatically sup-
porting the very things he now Opposes. There
is no doubt that a lawyer makes a good renegade.

This from “ Banksia ” :
Daglish steps down from the leadership of Westralian
Labor Party to make way for W. D. Johnson, of Kalgoorlie.
Johnson is a spry and hustling Maorilander—a contrast
in every way to the dreary, lymphatic Daglish. Designed
by Nature as a drummer, carpenter bv trade, coffin-maker
by preference, accident made him a politician. He scraped
in for Kalgoorlie on a minority vote of 606 in 1901, beating
Charlie Moran (then minister for Lands) and two others.
He sat for three years with distinction. Wiseacres pre-
dicted his certain defeat at the next election, but the
political tide ran strongly for Labor in 1904 and carried
Johnson in on the flood. He got 1556 votes. He took
office in the Daglish Government as Minister for Works
and proceeded to do things, till he was generally conceded
to be the hardest working Minister who had held office in
the West. His capacity, grit and energy singled him out
as the strongest man in the Labor team and the natural
leader of the party. Johnson will go far—how far the
game of pitch and toss which is called politics can alone
determine.
Veteran Archbishop Murphy, of Hobart,
who has passed his 90th year, is the world’s oldest
R. G. archbishop, and was once its youngest bishop.
He has “pastored” three generations of men;
owed mundane allegiance to five British Sove-
reigns, and spiritual ditto to seven Popes. He
finished 60 years priesthood, the other day,
of which period 25 years were spent in India, and
the remainder in Tasmania.
Mars Buckley has exhaled. Perhaps he
was a ferocious-looking baby 80 years agone, but a
more inappropriately christened child never was.
An ordinary sort of man, with an inefficient
appearance, but a first-rate hand at business,
he built up a retail drapery pile, with Nunn, in
40 years. He grew wealthy out of his shop,
and Melbourne Argus frankly put it: “He was
simply a business man, and as such, for nearly 40
years, was engrossed in his own affairs.” Mars
Buckley died worth about a quarter of a million,
and the papers labored in much ink to tell who he
was and what he didn’t do.
The lamentable Wilks wasted quite a time
in the House of Reps, the other night claiming
that Lord Hopetoun was an Orangeman, and on
the other side of the House another foolish person
took up time denying the statement. Does it
matter in the least to Australia whether Hopetoun
was an Orangeman, or an apple-woman, or a
Buffalo, or an Hibernian, or a Cheerful Elk ?
Whether he was or not isn’t worth five seconds of
the time of an Australian municipal council, let
alone of the Australian Parliament.
“O.”: Be Ford Madox Brown’s allusion
to “Wentworth the Lag” (B. 5/10/’O5) and W.
M. Rosetti’s surmise that “lag” was a reference
to Wentworth’s lagging habits, it is really to
Governor Macquarie the libel on the Wentworth
name is to be traced. Macquarie, excusing him-
self to the Secretary of the Colonies for having
introduced to his table and placed on the bench of
magistrates certain emancipists, mentioned in his
despatch D’Arcy Wentworth and two others as
special examples of convicts who had reformed.
All acquainted with the early records know that
D’Arcy Wentworth came out a freeman. What
makes blunder the more inexplicable
is that he and Wentworth were on terms of private
friendship. Moreover, Macquarie was painstaking
and methodical in keeping tally of the first
families.
“ Via”: Why not start a museum of Stink-
ing Fish specimens ? As 13 exhibits, lam will-
ing to contribute the following:—Joey Car-
ruthers, Tozer, Jack Want, Hasbeen Pliilp,
Senator Dobson, J os. Symon, Reid, Sydney
Telegraph, Melbourne Argus, Jack’Aynes,
Spruce Myth, Jokecook, and Queensland’s
little Jenkinson.
Webb Gilbert, one of Melbourne’s
neglected sculptors, is just now at work on
a very convincing head of a local pressman.
“Head” is a better word than “bust”
where a journalist is the subject; and,
moreover, the likeness to the man doesn’t
go lower than his neck. One or two other
busts in Gilbert’s show-room (at his dwell-
ing-house in Fitzroy) display his aptitude
for moulding a true portrait. A Victorian
by birth, he gets little enough encourage-
ment to follow his artistic calling, and it is
only by acting as chef at a Melbourne restaur-
ant that he can pay his way. In his
“spare” time he must be an industrious
worker. The studies in marble that he
has exhibited at the Vic. Artists’ Gallery
are of his own chiselling, and he has a block
ready for the reproduction of his clever
clay-model of the scribe aforesaid. There is
some talk of giving him the commission
for a Gillies memorial bust. One can
hardly believe that the late Duncan Gillies
was seriously regarded as an exemplary
Eolitical personage by his Tory friends,
ut it is a fact that they have subscribed
the wherewithal to set up an effigy of the
generally disrespected old incubus.
J. W. Holliman, secretary to the N.S.W.
Public Service Board, has just returned from a trip
to England. Holliman is about the smallest man
in the public service, though, as in the case of the
bull-ant, his energy must not be judged by his
dimensions. Notices issued by his department
are worded: “By order of the undersized, J. W.
Holliman, Secretary.” At least that is the
slander which goes round.
Cheery William Siddeley, now gone for
ever from Melbourne’s busy haunts, must have
been almost or quite the doyen of merchants. He
dated commercially from 1852. Who could believe
him to be 79 ? W. P. White and Co. was the title
of the firm that agented for Wigram and the
Blaekwall liners, but for many years it meant
William Siddeley.
“ Elgin Grey ” : Let me tell a thing about
James Densley, whose death at Bacchus Marsh
(Yic.), at upwards of a century, Bulletin re-
corded (with some men-
tal reservations re the
age) a week or two ago.
Locally, that fine old
man was known as
“Charlie Carter,” a
name exemplifying pri-
mitive nomenclature, for
he was through all the
early days a carter on
the roads. The “ Char-
lie ” was a handy name
for any man of cheery
disposition, whose true
Christian name was tem-
porarily lost. But here
is the fact I want to get
out: Charlie was a bul-
lock-driver for half a
century or more—pro-
bably much more—and
Charlie Carter, native-
bo r n bullock-driver,
never swore! “’Ang
yourheyes!” were Char-
iie’s strongest “cuss”
words. If the common
bush liar doesn’t be-
lieve me, ask any of the ancient cow-puncliers
of the Marsh, along whose roads Charlie’s blue
smock-frock was for some decades as well-known
as the mile-posts of later days. Ask Tom Cain
and Con Mahoney, and such of the numerous clan
Grant as are yet surviving.
The three oldest members of the S.A.
Assembly are ex-Works Minister Burgoyne, who
is 78 and has sat for the same district for 21 years;
Gilbert, who is 75J and has been in Parliament
continuously for 24 years; and Labor Member
Sellar, who is 75 and has sat for barely five months
as member for Adelaide. Sellar (who is offended
if you don’t print in Sellar) first sought
election to the S.A. Assembly 40 years ago and
had tried about 40 times before he succeeded last
May.
THE APPEAL UNTO CAESAR.
King Edward declined to see a deputation of the Lon-
don unemployed that proposed to wait on him.—Cable-
gram.
“ Hullo! Where is Ccesar! ”
“Skull”: The police of Melbourne have
lost a good friend in the person of the late Judge
Gaunt. Gaunt was a glorified policeman himself,
and as a goldfields warden dated back to the old
digging days, when to be a trooper was to be a
hated enemy of the people. Something of the
taint of that old officialdom seemed to cling to
Gaunt, P.M., and to Gaunt, the County Court
Judge; at any rate, the p lice always reckoned it
many pounds in their favor to have the purple and
stertorous Judge to hear their case.
Died, last week in Adelaide, A. M.
Wilson, who was accountant of the Commercial
Bank of S. Australia, at the time of the smash in
1886, and with Alex. Crooks, the manager,
suffered in consequence. Adelaide has never
been able to make up its mind whether both of
them were scapegoats, or whether only Wilson
was. Crooks afterwards faded out of the land-
scape; Wilson, a younger man, faced the world
again in the old spot, and completely rehabili-
tated himself. For many years he was business
manager at the Broken Hill South mine, and
built up a local reputation that any man might be
proud of.
“ Sartor ” : I have more than once noticed
that disrespectful persons doubt whether Mr.
Willie Kelly’s presence is absolutely necessary in
the councils of the nation. What presumption !
Why, his Oxford walk (or is it the Lambeth
walk ?) is a standing lesson to the members who
stride in as if they had never heard of Brazenface
and Maudlin Colleges. And then his Oxford
rnannah, with the frequent recurrence of sir ”in
his speech—“ where, sir, I ask, sir, will you find,
sir, another member, sir, who so elegantly embel-
lishes his words, sir, with ‘sirs,’ sir?” And look
at the beautiful parting of his hair, and the
graceful crease in his trousers, and oh, the
matchless way he hitches those trousers up as he
sinks into a padded seat !
Stipendiary magistrate Wilshire, who has
the preliminary hearing of the Common Law
charge against W. P. Crick, in connection with
the Lands scandal, loomed large in connection
with N.S. Wales’ last big Common Law prosecu-
tion. When it was proposed to “ deal with ” ex-
M.’sL.A. Sleath and Ferguson and others for
“conspiracy” oyer the Broken Hill miners’
strike, E. H. Wilshire, then in the Crown Law
Department, prepared the case against them, and
instructed counsel throughout. A. N. Barnett,
the president of the new Children’s Court, was
the magistrate at the preliminary hearing of that
case.
From a man who knew him :
Mars Buckley, luckiest of Melbourne drapers, went to
his long account the other day. When Melbourne was
very young, and had more money than finery in its
midst, a visiting Sydney draper—the original Hordern-
selected a good Bourke-street site for a shop, and put up
the money to start young men Buckley and Nunn in
business. He gave them the chance to pay off the
liability within a certain period, not expecting them to be
able to do it. The gold came rolling in from Ballarat
and Bendigo, and the new business prospered amazingly.
Buckley and Nunn were free of their patron in a year or
sb, and their profits went on increasing steadily until the
end of the boom time, when Buckley—partner Nunn
being then dead —sold out to a syndicate at an enormous
figure, and the shop saw him no more. Robert Reid, the
head of the syndicate, floated the present Buckley and
Nunn company in London. Buckley was the meanest
and most unkindly of bosses. It was said that he finally
retired from his shop without troubling to shake hands
with his oldest employees. Nunn, the partner in England
who bought for the firm, had been on bad terms with
Buckley all the time, and on more than one occasion
when the Melbourne man proposed to go “ home ” for a
trip, Nunn somehow contrived to change his resolve.
NOT SATISFIED.
Proceedings in the House last week indicated that the
Government had broken down the Frectrade stonewall
and was well on the way to practical business. Yesterday
Mr. Reid came back after a long absence, and for some
time business was again thrown to the winds. —AGE.
Can't he be satisfied with his own bone?
Far and away the
most picturesque fi-
gure in the Reps, is
King O’Malley.
Stowed away in that
corner on the back of
the Ministerial bench
from which Deakin
crumpled up tbeßeid
Government a few
months ago, he looks
like a hairy buffalo
lazily waiting to
charge someone. He
curls up in the corner
in an attitude of su-
premest slothfulness;
but all the while
his eyes are darting
hither and thither all
over the Chamber,
and his ears are on
the alert for a chance
to interject. He in-
terjects more than
anyone else in the
House, except per-
haps Wilks. And yet no one (else ever
makes an interjection without drawing from
O’Malley a raucous “Chair! chair!” generally
followed by an interjection of his own. Like a
Hindu god or a Chinese goblin, O'Malley, by his
very uncouthness, compels attention and almost
secures respect.
“ Arahura Dick” was Premier Seddon’s
early-day nickname on “The Coast.” Maoriland’s
King, reminiscing the other day, told of how in
his gold-digging career in Westland he was nearly
drowned in the Arahura, and of how he was
afterwards christened as above because he repre-
sented Arahura in the old Provincial Council. The
Arahura is the famous greenstone river of the
Maoris. Far up this stream, according to native
legend, lies a canoe of green jade-stone, on the
river bottom just below a waterfall —the petrified
canoe of the Polynesian explorer Tama-ki-te-
Rangi—the crew still in their places, paddle in
hand, ready to start forward on' their old, old
quest after something that is forgotten now, or in
pursuit of nothing in particular.
A popular Adelaide professor was once
invited to a very smart dinner party, and, as the
distance was far from town, to stay for thp night.
He arrived in a somewhat shabby walking suit,
without either bag or baggage. The host, rather
surprised, showed him his room, and was more
surprised when the professor emerged some time
later in the orthodox dress-suit. When the time
came for retiring, the host, knowing his guest had
no luggage, went to offer him the loan of pyjamas,
but the professor declined with the remark that
he had his own. “Got them on now under these
things—same as I had the other suit over this.
Much easier way to do things; saves bother.”
“ Itan ” : Be the extension of Southport
(Q.) railway from the border to the Tweed Head 3
wharf (N.S.W.), about 100 yards. Premier
Morgan has the plans prepared, and, though
Oarruthers doesn’t like it, the work will be carried
out shortly. But while N.S.W. didn’t block this
work, it displayed its usual provincialism in
refusing to connect the Tweed Heads with the
Grafton line at Murwillumbah, a 16-miles exten-
sion, and thus join the two systems. And this
despite the fact that the last N.S.W. Government
induced Queensland to build the line from South-
port, so that it could be easily converted to the
wider gauge, with the idea of eventually altering
it to carry N.S.W. trains right through to Bris-
bane. The dominating importer in Sydney thinks
he may lose a few customers for his calicoes if the
Clarence, Richmond, and Tweed people could get
through to the North by rail and trade with the
nearest city, instead of being forced to deal with
far-away Sydney.
The unemployed question has been raised,
for about the 100th time, in Queensland Assembly.
A report of the debate would not make a good
advertisement for the State —industrially or
economically. According to Reinhold, M.L.A.,
50 per cent, of the mechanic and laboring classes
in Brisbane are walking the streets in idleness,
and the remainder working less than half time.
Twenty-five carpenters recently left the State in
disgust; the boot trade is reported in “a deplor-
able condition ” ; 75 per cent, of the boiler makers
find nothing to do ; the stonemasons have scarcely
a man employed ; 150 laborers walked to Pinkenba
to fill 17 temporary jobs ; crowds of men beg for
work twice a day at the Roma-street railway
sheds, and the wharfs are thronged with unem-
ployed. And yet importers will tell us that what
is wanted is Free trade and heaps of immigrants.
There is a Bill before Yic. Parliament pro-
viding for rating the land, for municipal purposes,
on its unimproved value. The principle is to be
optional; a council may decide for itself whether
it will adopt the method or not; but the very
mention of the measure has sent a thrill of horror
down the backs of many of the squatter-controlled
municipalities. Yet the idea of the measure is
perfectly fair —to avoid taxing the energetic man,
and to get at the man who holds his idle allot-
ment until, by the exertion and the enterprise of
others, it has increased in value. At present,
this latter objectionable person is hardly taxed at
all, while the man who puts a fresh coat of paint
on his house, or builds a new fowl-house, finds
that his valuation has risen, and his taxes are
increased.

NTIL WE WENT to see ROMEO and JULIET, a while ago, and HEARD
the lines— “ THEY MAY SEIZE
On THE WHITE WONDER of dear Juliet’s hand,
And steal IMMORTAL BLESSING from her lips,”
we were UNDER the IMPRESSION that
“White” vSewing Machine
WAS
Only White Wonder.
Then, in ANOTHER PART of the play, when MERCUTIO
speaks of ROMEO as
“STABBED WITH
A WHITE WENCH’S BLACK EYE,”
we thought, if THIS is not still another WHITE WON-
DER, it is certainly a WONDER in WHITE and
BLACK. Turning, however, from the MIMIC STAGE
to the demands of ACTUAL LIFE, and passing from
COMEDY and TRAGEDY to the MORE PRACTICAL
REALM of

we find that
The ONLY * *
White WONDER
is
The "WHITE”

The wonderful way THE “WHITE” has, and the

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
~ „ . Sydney, October 17, 1905.
My Dear Arini,—
The three naval weddings to occur presently,
and the two other naval ditto to come off in the
near future, are of more interest to Sydney than
the violent language in the Athanasiau Creed,
.flour of the five brides-elect are moneyed. An
authority tells me that the majority of naval men
who get engaged to Australian girls make their
otters in lasmania. For weeks before the fleet
goes there, local girls, and trespassing girls from
all the States of the Commonwealth, gather as
unto the strife and keep their faces in cold cream
and their hair in cocoa-nut oil (like the Yorkshire
terriers), and get ten hours’ sleep nightly. For
the rest, the beauty and romance of Lipscombe’s
Cardens by night is responsible. There heavy
fruited trees, flower-massed mazes of earth, moon-
light or soft electrics in the tree-ferns and camphor
laurels suggest to him to say, “ Wilt thou ’ ” And
she wilts.
Now that women are in politics some arrange-
inent will have to be made for 11 chucking out ” the
lady who goes to meetings with the dishonorable
intention of interrupting speakers. We must
have the able-bodied woman constable, and the
mode of ejection will, of course, be a grasp on the
back-hair and the waist-belt. Perhaps, though
with evolution the political woman will “drop’ s
to the danger of long hair, and will wear it so
that no policewoman shall be able to get a
purchase. At the Immigration League’s meeting
on Saturday night a She constantly interrupted
.Dr. Arthur, but audience and police shrank from
expulsion. Until the policewoman is a fact the
policeman had better provide himself with a
leather belt to be buckled round the interjector’s
waist. It should have a strap-handle at the back.
Having fixed this on the delinquent, he could
propel her firmly but kindly to the door, using
the loop at the back of the belt for one purchase,
and the lady’s collar for the other. This would be
better than taking her by the hair and the arm.
Another idea would be to send a boy in to the
interjecting lady with a telegram that her best
hat wjis on fire at home, or a message that Julius
Knight was waiting outside in his Roman cos-
tume, and wanted to speak to her at once.
The Oswald Watts—one of his social frills is
that of extra aide-de-camp to Governor Rawson—
are rejoicing over the birth of their first infant
—-a son. Mrs. Watt will be remembered by Mel-
bournians as the handsome Muriel Williams.
The sale of the Government yacht Victoria for
£lO,OOO still remains a mystery so far as the
identity of the purchaser is concerned. Mr.
Monty Severn negotiated the transaction on
behalf of an English buyer.
. VTi re here to-day and to-morrow we’re run-
ning up an undertaker’s bill,” as an American
humorist remarks. !Miss Edwina Geach (a sister
of sleepy-looking but very wide-awake Edwin)
has, to the great joy of her friends, just missed
having the bill presented. On a night she was in
perfect health and, crossing with a friend in the
Mosman boat, remarked, 44 These grey evenings
rejoice me. The world looks as if it had been
chloroformed.” Next forenoon she was in a
private hospital under anaesthetic and surgeon’s
knives. A real bad case of appendicitis.
Mr. Fred Manning, youngest son of W.P. of
that name, is in London in a literarv coterie whose
names recall the brilliant (and defunct) Yellow
Book The youngster is still at the vicarage in
Lincolnshire with Rev. Arthur Galton; and a
novel and a volume of four long short-stories are
about ready for publication. Latter are separately
dedicated to Bernard Shaw, and others.
Artist Conder is doing a frontispiece for the
volume. Talking of other Australians abroad:
Percy Grainger remains the most patriotic
of Australians. He makes profession from
the castle battlement so to speak. “I am
here ” (Dunrobin Castle on the note paper ; also
an animal holding up its paw to be shaken)
“staying at the Duchess of Sutherland’s. Scot-
land is one of the few places on the wrong side of
the line that fulfil my Australian craving for
untrammelled Nature.” And again, speaking of
his compositions: “I don’t want to bring out
anything seriously for lots of years, and then it
will be at Home in Australia.” Of Kipling:
He had me down at his place in Sussex
to hear the choruses I have written to so
many of his verses. A great, rough old
stone castle home he has, with all the hall-
ways whitewashed as they were hundreds
of years ago, and the doors heavy oak, rough and
unsmoothen. I played him my 4 Danny Deever ’
and 4 We Have Fed Our Sea For A Thousand
Years ’ (Seven Seas), and he said they were like
‘deaders rotting in bilge water.’ Later he
added, 4 Till now I’ve had to rely on black and
white, but you do the thing for me in color.’ ”
The dog—the elect of him—was having his bad
day last week, when the Kennel Club of N.S. W.
held its annual show. A dog, like all innately
noble creatures, loathes advertisement. A pleasant
break in the three days’ Bark was the encounter
between one exhibitor and the Club. He put
two dogs on the benches, and later on determined
to remove them. Attended by his solicitor and
his chauffeur and gardener he got them away
after a gigantic moral struggle. But the stewards
disqualified him as a dog-exhibitor for life,
so years and years hence, as he plods down the
grey avenue of years, and life becomes desolate
and joys scarce, the blight will still be upon him.
It will pursue him always, like the lost shadow of
the man who hadn’t one, and even if he
accumulates every other honor that man can attain
his cup of joy will be embittered by the fact that the
dog-committee of Sydney will have none of him.
.To it he is as one dead, and in a dog sense he is
excommunicated, anathema, disowned. Even if
his dog bites the committee it will refuse to
recognise that he has a dog, and will sue him for
keeping a vicious domestic alligator.
«. S* 16 ! king of the show was the St. Bernard
Healesvdle Laddie,” a Tasmanian dog, weighing
lOst., and with a benevolent head and the neces-
sary sign of intoxication in his eyes. His sire,
“ Barry Lord,” was that beautiful bow-wow mum-
mer who was on the stage with Charles Arnold in
* Hans the Boatman. ” Curious the liberties some
persons can take with dogs. There is the doggy
man, Crane, of the Herald, who doesn’t
hesitate to take hold of a strange exhibit
marked “dangerous” by its “long, punish-
ing jaws.” That is a telling phrase of
dog-knowers. Bull-terriers, the fighting dogs of
the world, have this kind of jaw. So have certain
Sydney K.C.’s. Two huggable snowy Borzois
came from Melbourne, progeny of those long,
lean, narrow, wolf-slaying Borzois given by the
Czar to “ Plevna ” Ryan. Mrs. Scale, wife of
Dr. Scale, of Balmain, showed several Chow dogs
the edible dogs of China. A man present
owned to haying eaten of the shoulder of one
roasted. Said they were bred for table use,
etc., and why not, etc. Medium-sized dog
the Chow is, with thin sable coat, prick
ears and fox-face. Disposition unfriendly to
man. He resents being eaten. Mrs. Flashman,
wife of the demonstrator of anatomy at the Uni.,

A friend sends me this:—
Sydney society—that portion of it that acts on com-
mittees and councils in the cause of charity—-is all any-
how. At a recent committee meeting in aid of a well-
known charity, a wealthy and brusque lady, whose long
tongue is generally excused by her long stocking (not that
one—the other), “ really went too far, you know,” and
three of the assemblage retired from the meeting in great
disorder, tearfully handing in their resignations as they
passed the chair. Next day the remnant met together in
fear and trembling, waiting for the Wrath to come. But
the Wrath did not come. She unexpectedly sent her
resignation in instead, as a protest against the weepful
collapse of her weak-kneed sistern. This the committee
eagerly accepted with thanks (which the resigner had not
counted on), and re-instated the forlorn three. This out-
come so enraged another influential Person that she
resigned too, and washed her hands completely of the
Deserving Object on whose behalf the meetings were.
Instead, she has loudly proclaimed the virtues of a rival
Deserving Object, and has called meetings to help it
along. Bnt society refuses to join her in the campaign,
which will apparently have to depend on ordinary people
in order to prosper.
The latest news of London’s “smart set” is
comforting. It has almost entirely left off drink,
so as to keep its head clear for bridge. It finds it
can’t gamble so well when it drinks.
At a densely-populated Sydney “At Home,”
lately, the hostess seems to have sought out an
invention. At one end of the billiard-room was
what appeared to be, prior to four o’clock, a huge
oblong table covered with a white cloth. Within
half-an-hour it was distributed all over the recep-
tion rooms and the verandahs. For it was made
up of dozens of small, white-clothed square tables
—well vittled, of course.
Mayoress of Sydney, Mrs. Allen Taylor, enter-
tamsthe children of the City Ragged Schools in
the Town Hall next Thursday afternoon.
Can'ie Moore, playing the role of a maid in
The Blue Moon,” is described by a Fog paper
as wearing
a short-skirted costume of palest grey silk, the bodice
boasting of a deep collar and turned-back cuffs of crochet
lace, and the frivolous little accordeon-pleated apron
being held in position by sundry bows of geranium-red
velvet; still another knot of ribbon being fastened in the
dark hair. Grey shoes and stockings and a positive foam
of grey chiffon underskirts are the further details of a
most dainty costume.
Suppose aserving damsel went seeking a “place”
in a get-up of that charm !
Artist Arthur Collingridge, who has just re-
turned from travel in far lands, tells this sparklet.
In the smoking-room of a liner in which he was
travelling was a group of men, playing a card
game and using such unusually vile language that
the artist was impelled to remonstrate, saying
that he had never heard worse vocabulary, and
adding at the same time that he was not extra-
fastidious himself. The bad-linguists looked at
him in astonishment, and then said they had no
objection to discontinue the expletives if he found
them offensive, “ but,” added one, leaning forward
and looking at the objector curiously, “ we thought
you were an Australian /”
Mr. Collingridge’s, it may be remarked, was
the chief voice raised for the purchase of that
new picture we have all gone daffy over. “Sur
les toits.” Its painter did not wish it exiled to
Australia, but the Australian bombarded him
with letters, and finally pursued him in person,
and brought him to see the altruistic side of the
deal. When the matter was placed before him in
a proper light, he realised that it was his duty to
let the painting depart to a far wild land, so that
it might be hung up on a gum tree (out of the
reach of bears) to improve the taste of the
aboriginal population.
An Adelaide correspondent writes :
The whole of the population of Adelaide at the time of
writing is treading down the violets and parsnips in
Government House grounds. Society’s pet Charity Ba-
zaar, or Fete, is happening, and so public has the place
become that Lady Le Hunte can no longer sit under her
own vine and fig-tree after she has washed her head, and
dry her hair in the sun. Everything, so far, seems to be
going off at big prices. Society’s motor-cars run twice
round the grounds for sixpence. These are well patro-
nised by the poorer members of the community, and their
screams of joy, as the cars just escape the corners of the
cabbage-patches, drown the cry of the amateur Punch-
and-Judy show. Pretty well every suburb is represented
by a stall, and each stall is attended by half the
population of the suburb. One stall (the sweets establish-
ment) is run solely by Jewish ladies. The giddy portion
of society has painted itself a deep rich black, like a stove
or a new boot, shortened its frocks, and done its hair in a
serio-comic roll, and is singing coon songs in a canvas
theatre. Julian Ayers, as a corner man, in appearance
resembles Charlie Pope, and is the most humorous man in
the show. Shylie Blue so far has only been a “seat-
warmer ” in the vaudeville entertainment, but is likely to
break out into a song and dance before the end of the
season. This is written on Friday, and nothing unfore-
seen has happened at the fete yet—except that Governor
Le Hunte was photographed in the Christy Minstrel
group alongside a Glenelg belle in song-and-dance
costume. I went expecting to find Lewis Cohen’s plug
hat tied to a shrub, and bearing* a notice asking* visitors to
throw waste paper into the sacred belltopper rather than
distribute it about the lawns. But I was disappointed
One can’t have everything in this world. Except for the
lack of Lewis Cohen’s chimney-pot headgear as a waste-
paper basket and receptacle for orange-peel, every
possible luxury is provided.
OUR NEW GEOGRAPHY.
A certain C. W. D. Goodchap recently wrote to Edward
VII. :—“lam desirous of commemorating the practical
services of the Royal House of Brunswick to the Empire
by most humbly requesting that your Majesty may be
pleased to command the Imperial Parliament to take into
consideration the advisableness of changing the name of
Australia to Brunswickland, Brunswick Kingdom, or
Brunswick Dominion, and to name the capital of the
Commonwealth Guelph.” Hence the above inspiration.
The orthodox mother-in-law trouble happened
rather earlier than usual after a recent wedding in
an Australian city. Before the day of joy was
over the bridegroom accused the bride’s mother of
having purloined some of the wedding presents.
There are two “leaps for life” taken nightly in
Sydney these times, one in each of the bush-
ranging plays running at the Royal and the
Criterion. But the leap for liberty made by the
small boy prisoner at the Children’s Court a week
or so ago beats the melodrama jumps. A local
daily said this rosebud bounded thirty feet from
his prison window to another window, whence
he slid to the ground and went home.
But thirty feet is obviously a snake. This
Children’s Court, by the way, is an institution
into which no spectators or uniformed police are
allowed. It was established by the strenuous
efforts of Dr. Arthur, Miss Rose Scott, and Miss
Sutherland. These and other philanthropists did
much regret to see little Billies and tiny Kitties
among the contaminating surroundings of the
grown-up offenders’ court. They grieved to see the
down brushed off the human peach and the
tremulous dew shaken off the flower-bud. And it
never dawned on them that the human peach
could jump a horizontal thirty feet.
Miss Maud Amber will Cup in some creations
of blue and brown adorned with the new spind-
rift lace. I forget its name, but the angels in
the nine choirs are said to be trimming their new
concert robes with it. Other intending Cuppers
are the wife and daughter of the owner of Warroo.
They will adorn some languid painted nets with
pink silk buttons, chiffon, cascades of straw-hued
lace, roses, and something new in the way of
sashes “ crossed at the back.” (It is ten chances
to one the compositor will make this read “ cursed
at the back.”)
Miss Maud Want (niece of the K.C.), whose
engagement to Mr. Charles Cape is announced, is
at present in England. The Capes are among the
leading R.C. families of this State, so the marriage
will be of the “mixed” sort so unpopular with
R.C. clergy.
Mr. Harry Henderson, the steamship man, back
from Vancouver, tells how at a restaurant at that
water frontage he was asked by the waitress
of whom he had demanded salmon : “ Salmon !
yes; will you make it a ‘starter’ ?” The visitor
was puzzled, but he ventured the query, “How
many are running?” “Sir!” said the waitress
haughtily. “Well,” continued he, “won’t you
tell me the scratchings?” It turned out that in
making a dish a “starter ” you make your whole
meal of it.
The gallant Captain Fitzpatrick is in Sydney
for a few days en route for Melbourne from the
Armytages’ station in Queensland.
A beauty machine that you may carry in your
pocket-book is now available. It is two feet of
rubber hose with a glass mouthpiece at one end
and a glass cup at the other. You suck one end
of the swindle—l mean the tube—and under the
other (the vacuum end) the hollows in your cheeks
or the salt-cellars in your neck plump out half-an-
inch, and folks say of you : “ There she goes with
a face made out of a rose.”
In the newspaper notices of a recent local
wedding it was mentioned that the wreath of orange
blossoms and tulle veil worn by the bride were
lent for the occasion by a friend of the bride.
Name and State of lender were given. Surely the
lending oi bride garniture is a new idea. Or if
any brides have hitherto borrowed flowers and
veil they have not done it in this public fashion.
The valuable old lace veil worn by great granny
and now lent to one of her posterity for bridal
gear is quite another matter. In England you
can hire a thousand pound cheque “from an
uncle of the bride ” to lie on the table among your
presents. Also, a girl friend of mine here in
Sydney has been offered the present of all her
wedding garments, and the loan of a diamond
engagement ring and a country house for the
honeymoon. All she lacks is a bridegroom,
prospective or otherwise.
Yours Affectionately,
ARENEHI.
MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, October 16, 1905.
My Dear Yarrie,—
For some time past our two Vice-Regal houses
have been without any young she-persons. This
is to be remedied in the Stonington case very
shortly. Miss Stuart-Wortley, another niece of
the Talbottle Dame, is a forthcoming consign-
ment from the Big Smoke. Her dad is the Par-
liamentary Stuart-Wortley, and brother of the
grey Ex. The young lady is aboard the China,
and lands here in time for the Derby.
The latest Miss to drop her band-box at Stoning-
ton is travelling out with the Earl Jerseys, who
are to be the star guests of the Commonwealth
Exes, this coming season of Horse. Several
smaller persons trip out also by the China, among
them Miss Ethel Guthrie, the Geelong golfer, and
one of Toorak’s favorites.
The Vice-Regals break out into revelry at the
start of the Cup junkets. The G.-G. and his
chirpy dame top the list with a lawn party and a
Federal hop. The State Exes, follow with a
strawberry scramble at Stonington, when they
hope to wipe out all old scores by inviting some
thousands to trail the terrace.
A recent arrival from the Cold Country talks
gushingly of Ada Crossley and her medical
spouse. At a little farewell tiffin the Mueckes
billed and cooed, and were youthfully enthusiastic
about each other. Dr. Muecke is determined to
secure every diploma knocking round, and to toil
as closely at medical work as wifie at her pro-
fession. Their ambitions seem to be a joint bond
of sympathy, and each metes out encouragement
to the other. This view of the bride upsets all old
notions of the Crossley as unromantic, unsenti-
mental, and strictly practical. Fancy what a
throb and a sob she’ll put into “God Be With
You ” now.
The Mayoral Pleasances had a great big
kick to mark the close of their term. It was on a
colossal scale. The Town Hall doesn’t admit of
the balconies being moved about, or the organ
changing places with the gallery clock, but short
of that, everything of a transforming nature was
effected. A dais of impromptu carpentry reared
its lowly head from the south end of the hall.
The idea of saving the gubernatorial vision a sight
of the dial during the dreary time of sitting-out
the dances had evidently suggested this. The
band was brought from the south gallery, and
partly buried among the tall palms that sprang
from the invisible pots with the reckless pro-
fusion of a rabbit’s family. Two processions of
different fuss and solemnity broke into the affair.
The first was formed of the State Exes., and this
was “God-saved” and had an advance deputy in
the person of Town-Clerk Clayton. The second
was a much-weightier performance. For it the
whole strength of the City Council (looking much
like grave, elderly footballers in mourning stock-
ings) with the chained and furred Worship at
their head, turned out as a body guard and
joranced in with the G.-G. and Dame Northcote.
Several listless members of the suite, wearing
light coat lapels, brought up the rear. The Tal-
bottles sat on the dais, long and lean and a trifle
haughty, and gazed at the theatrical entry of the
greater potentates.
The semi-circle of dais dames at that Mayoral
ball glistened as under a fall of brilliant hail, more
of the stones landing on some than on others. It
was an evidence that it hails both on the just and
the unj ust. Lady N orthcote came in for most and
the little wall of them round her throat surpassed
all rival displays. Her illuminations, in fac- beat
the whole of the diamond glare in the hali uv-a
long flash. Petunia chiffons and a drapery t
spangles hinted broadly at the Northcote delight
in bright plumage. The Talbot Dame’s furnishings
were stiffer and statelier. Poppy-red shoulder
straps, a waist scarf and ends, and a lofty aigrette
as unbending as a church steeple, lent aid to an
oyster-satin ring. The giddineis of the hue was
subdued by the grey thatch and the extra-grey
deportment of the lady. The Mayoress shone
forth in a gorgeous farewelling garb and
a bold array of gems. The swan-note apparel
naturally turned to semi-bereavement tones —
black and white, with some expensive Chantilly
lace. A debuting daughter of hers wore as
alluring head-gear a scintillating chaplet of silver-
frosted leaves. All the other daughters contented
themselves with cotton roses or lilies of the valley,
or any other milky blossom of the blameless life.
The double presentation bob proved such a
calamitous performance at that ball, when a brace
of Governors’ wives had to be bobbed to, that one
important trainer of the toes lias had a shoal of
debuting Misses (coming out Cup week) on her
door-mat, requesting lessons in the art of the
double genuflection, and the knack of retiring
with the dignity that doesn’t twist its ankle or
tear its tail. The only bobber to successfully get
through with the curtsey, and retire from view
without awkwardness at the mayoral fling, was
the host’s own daughter; and rumor hath it that
the gentle Doris practiced the presentation
salute for weeks previously.
A daughter of politician Billson “came out” at
the Mayoral hop—making the nine hundred and
ninetieth this year of gladness. The Billsons are
in the fizzy drink line. Let’s hope that the girleen
just launched on the tide that leads to matrimony
will go off pop like dad’s best soda-water, and
that the cork will strike the right man in the eye.
The chirpy little Mayor-elect has (never yet cut
a dash outside municipal circles. Gne faction was
bent on getting Mr. H. Weedon elected, while a
smaller one struggled to seat Mr. D. Y. Hennessey in
thechair, and the absurd fur robe and the manacles;
and the chirpy Weedon won the day. His wife (a
second matrimonial venture) rather shrinks from
the fierce light that beats upon a Mayoral pair,
though she’s not naturally a shrinking sort—being
rather large and possessing the air of confidence
that comes of a figure preserved to the forties.
She stands a head above her liege-lord, and seems
to mutely protest against his strenuousness.

The Shine that
Outshines
EVERYTHING else in the
way of shoe-shines is the shine
you get from Hauthaway’s
Crozine
Blacking
which is pleasant and easy to use, and more
than pleasant in the effect it has upon your
boots and shoes There is no uncertainty
about it. While putting the shine on to the
boots it puts softness into the leather, and
and thereby renders them more comfortable
and more durable. The shine that Crozine
insures is a shine of deep shimmering
black, as brilliant as jet.
Can be had from all Boot Stores.
Insist upon having Hauthaway’s.
It is best to get the best.

N.S.W. Chief Justice has just decided, the
fate of a Dago with a name resembling Piano.
Said Dago was detected offering for sale a great
quantity of oysters much smaller than the legal
size. He was charged with committing a breach
of the N.S.W. Fisheries Act —a piece of legis-
lation passed to protect the State’s oysters, &c.
The desirable immigrant named Piano swore that
the shellfish came from Maryborough (Q.), and
his defence was that the Act did not apply to
Queensland fish. C.J. Darley decided that his
contention was fatal to the prosecution, and the
decision shows a large gap in the law, as most
verdicts do. Nowadays the importation of in-
visible oysters should be a sin, and anywr~ what
is the law in Queensland with regard to the up-
rooting of what the junior reporter terms the
“succulent bivalve?”

Miss Vera Clarke and Miss Alison Fairbairn
were two flutterers I noticed at that Pleasance
shivoo. A chick of Byron Moore wore green in a
sweet-pea shade, and shone as the freshest-com-
plexioned of all the young things. The majority
of mothers left their prize offspring at home, for a
Mayoral festivity is of little use to the really
smart girleen.
A correspondent tells me :
The matrons and misses of the Alexandra Club, Mel-
bourne, have for the moment dropped all dis-
cussion regarding the frocks and morals of their best
friends, and now are spending much of their time weeping
in the committee-room. Indignant letters have arrived
from Australians in England, who had been told that the
Alexandra Club was affiliated with the tony Empire Club,
London. From the conflicting mass of correspondence
forwarded by the disappointed ones, one coherent state-
ment is decipherable—that an angular person meets one
and all in the strangers’ room to explain “ that the com-
mittee of the Empire Club regrets that there should have
been any misunderstanding, as the secretary wrote
months ago explaining that the honor of affiliation pro-
posed by the Alexandra was declined.” The Alexandra
Club is said to be uncertain whether to appeal in its
extremity to the London County Council or to the Labor
party in Australia.
Thomas Bent has just put his massive hoof down
on a proposal of a few of Melbourne’s best people.
The Australian Institute of Domestic Economy,
which is understood to be intended to show bud-
ding brides and would-be dittos how to cook a
chop and mend the old man’s socks, has advertised
for a lady superintendent. There were several
applications for the billet, which is worth about
£3OO a year, but a committee of three—Janet Mrs.
Clarke, Mrs. Smyth and Miss Vale—decided that
none of them was fully qualified, and desired
Thomas to import a high-class dame from England
or the United States. As the State heavily sub-
sidises the precious A.1.D.E., and as it has the
gratis use of a Government building, Thomas bel-
lowed an emphatic “No.” Which is very right
and proper; but it’s a pity Bent didn’t apply that
principle, when he ordered from Scotland the
dredge Pioneer, which has turned out such a sorry
encumbrance.
The executive of Governor Le Hunte’s garden
mte m aid of Adelaide charities mortally wounded
u s^ sce P t . i bilities of some of the society ladies of
that holy city, by arranging to have cash registers
on tne various stalls. The matter was made worse
because some of the stalls were omitted from the
provision, but the invidious distinction is ac-
counted for by the assertion that there were not
enough cash registers to go round. But were
there not enough honest assistants to go square ?
The pushing draper who persists in forcing his
goods on to weak-minded women who don’t want
them, got a healthy set-back lately from a
Fitzroy bench of honorariums, who decided that,
as the woman in question was well supplied by
her husband with all necessaries and had plenty
of dresses, that careful person was not liable for
certain frills and trimmings that the draper-man
had rushed her into buying. Two shillings had
been paid as deposit, 225. more being claimed.
Verdict for defendent, with 265. costs.
The Nicho Fitzgeralds came back last week
from a leisurely loaf on the Mediterranean coast.
Me showed up at his old Legislative haunts soon
after dumping his pyjama case on shore, and was
immediately assured by all the other ancients of
ii 6 r' that he looked brighter, brisker and
all the rest of it than he had done for years. How
the dodderers love to suggest that their vigor
increases vvith age ! The jaunt certainly refreshed
the upright ’ brewer. His spouse, one of the
famous Victorian grandmas who preserve their
waists and refuse to turn grey, has come back with
crisp chiffons and great news of the swagger Aus-
tralians abroad—the Australians who have taken
away from this country great swags of money, and
show their gratitude mostly by bitter abuse of the
land. She had tea and confidences with all the
absentee squatteresses of our Wool District, to say
nothing of the various ex-Governors at large in
I ogtown.

Last week the only chick of the Railway Taits
rallied her young pals to an Animal Tea. This
is the latest United States distraction for the
lovers of conundrums. There were no actual
specimens on the scene, but a knowledge of the
habits of beasties was necessary for the giggling
C ? l vr >e^l T? rs \ -i^ 10 prize fell to the youngest hope
ot Mr 3. Brodnbb. When there’s any brain work
to be done by fluttersome chicks, the Brodribbs
always score. There’s a most determined and
successful look about those girls.
The flower-faced young hope of Mrs. Edward
Braddon is booked for matrimony with Captain
Bernard Nicolay, of the 4th Goorkha Rifles. The
young Hobart charmer frivolled in this State
last year, and struck everyone as a remarkably
fresh young thing. Her hat was generally awry,
but Nature saw that her complexion wasn’t. As
a sample of a small-sized Tasmanian beauty, Miss
May Braddon shows well.
i. A of Sydney and Adelaide golfers have
booked berths in this city for the Royal Melbourne
tournament. Most of them remain for the Cup,
removing the burr and debris of the links from
their personal effects in nice time for the horse
carnival.
The engagement of a pretty chick from another
State has just happened in the nick of time.
Mama was at her wits’ end how to keep the ball
rolling bravely much longer. How she must
rejoice ! There’s many a dame gone to her bourne
heart-broken because of the match that nearly
came off but didn’t. Just at the eleventh houp
the frill fell off a little, and the gallant wooer,
alarmed at the shabby sad look of things, rode
away from the girl of his heart. The tragedies
of engagements that didn’t come off would make
damp, dreary reading.
Miss Unie Russell was the sweetheart of Julius
Garrick at the Saturday show, and all her school
chums swarmed to the Princess to
see her in the arms of the gorgeous Knight. It
was regarded as a big thing to star with the mum-
mer of the lovely legs, but the fair Unie wasn’t
overcome. On the contrary she quits the boards.
She has had enough mumming in spite of the
opportunities heaped on her in the sub-starring
wa y- Old pros, and young stage-struck dreamers
are flabbergasted at such a favored one abandoning
‘ the profession.”
Caulfield Guineas saw no ravishments of dress,
owing mainly to the fact that the sky was flecked
with overmuch grey. Flutterers got near Spring
intentions only in head-gear of a grotesque and
cranky order. Some toques were the size of duck
eggs, and lodged at an angle that left three-
quarters of the bump-area exposed. Other mil-
linery oddities shaded the eyes like winkers, and
had a back kick for the under-brimming of crowded
flower plots. Miss Harrie Ireland, in slim grey
tailorings, wore the queerest top-piece of the
day. It was a round green-gage toque with
foliage of nut-shade to complete the fruit ensemble.
Mrs. J. Alston Wallace had another extra-
ordinary sample—a large Nile-green Gainsborough,
on which a feather, that looked singularly like a
huge clump of green and pink seaweed, stretched
from fore to aft with much fuss. Miss Wilson, of
Geelong, was the best picture on the terrace. She
wore a trailsome white glace of graceful lines, and
a fichu. A French hat had one white feather
a-curl round most of the brim, a tiny buttonhole
of French roses looking chic on the crown.
Of the -foorak element, Mrs. Lachlan Mackinnon
arrived nearest the bull’s-eye of fashion in a putty-
cloth garb, with chenille fringe marking a double-
decker skirt and helping the top-storey to effec-
tiveness. Some ostrich plumage fluttered from
her crown-piece. The immense black crinoline
hat of Mrs. F. Raleigh had two feathers beyond
price, and white tulle swathed round the brim,
over the face, and fastening in a fussy chou under
the chin.
The Northcotes attended —the dame of the cor-
dial smile and the crisp comment a-trail in purple
velvet, with a quartet of aides following the
sweep of her tail with solemn step and slow.
Private Sec. Share alone hath a beaming counten-
ance. Captain Balmain looks the pink ’un of the
staff.
Miss Maud Jeffries was grey in garb and com-
plexion at that Guineas meeting. The languid
mummer starred on the terrace for all that, the
Osbornes and Maddens circling round in gushful
eddies. The spouse and a lengthy young brother
hovered near on duty.
Mr. and Mrs. John Gatto are off to S. Africa
early in the year. The squatter pair have mapped
out a long, interesting programme for themselves
and their piquant little daughter—one of the
prettiest buds of this season.
The death of Mars Buckley occurred while
the people of Beaulieu were much scattered. The
one beloved and much-petted daughter of the
family is at present in London. The news will be
a bad shock for her. The veteran draper mean-
dered around Toorak and a few frilly rallies with
a listless air. He was never a gadder, never a
voyager, never a frolicsome party. He had a
clear, strong head for business, and a happy way
•of talking common-sense to the men, which they
liked.
A pair of visitors—the O’Neill Powers—are
being rather rushed at present. When asked
who the two strangers are the Staughtons and
and other Toorakites say, with a large compre-
hensive gesture—“the O’Neill Powers, of Power
Hall, Waterford, a great old Irish family, don’t
you know.” There seems a healthy ring about
the double Hibernian label and a splendid
sound, do you mind, about Power Hall. Cards
are dropping profusely into the Grand or: the pair
as a result.
The only chick of the Adelaide Yice-Regals
was allowed to come forth from the nursery into
the reception-rooms to celebrate her birthday (she
has started into her teens), the other day. A
number of kiddies were bidden to joy over the
event and to make merry through a whole long
evening. Now all the Holy City has broken out
into kids’ parties.
The plump and patriarchal Dr. Bevan is due
back this week. The Congregational Church flock
gets into crimp and curl-papers for the home-
coming.
Another marriage that arose from a ship-board
acquaintance called for a wedding bell of special
size and quality last month in the Big Smoke,
when Miss May Hindley, daughter of the Mel-
bourne Archdeacon, joined lots with Mr. Ernest
Castle, a Sydney-sider.
Miss Doris Madden, the strummer hailing from
Ballarat, is being taken up at last by the rest of
her kin. At a recent afternoon shivoo the young
pianist performed, and her cousin Lesly figured
on the same programme.
Yours,
TETPHENA.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Our meek brown fellow-subject again :
Suva, Fiji, Sept. 30th.—The criminal sessions are now
proceeding-. Nearly all the accused are Indians, and
there are several murders and serious assaults.—S.M.
Herald.
The Australian Government has wisely
decided that any wireless telegraphy service
between the Commonwealth and Maoriland must
be Government-owned. Having done that much
the next thing is to hustle and get the service
started with Maoriland and also with Tasmania.
The Maoriland Leg. Council, on the cast-
ing vote of the Speaker, carried the second reading
of a Bill to permit lotteries to be conducted in the
State. Having got so far the sensible idea would
be to enact that the State shall run the lottery,
and that the profits shall constitute a sinking fund
for the reduction of the very robust public debt.
According to information that comes from
Queensland, Booth intended that the States
should pay him £l5 per head for his derelicts !
The critical reception of his preliminary proposals
convinced the slave-driver with the Nose that
there wasn’t a ghost of a chance of collecting the
bill, so the subject dropped without any formal
presentation of the invoice.
Victoria, which allows the big landlords to
keep all its best area a wilderness, had two for-
feited selections to dispose of recently— two selec-
tions in a far-out region with no railway
anywhere near —and over 100 people applied.
Yet when Victoria can’t find room for Booth’s
agriculturists, the landlord class says it is all
owing to the Six Hatters.
Sydney Parliament, which has been speak-
ing severely about drink this month past, does its
maledictions in a building erected in return for a
monopoly in rum selling. Wentworth and two
others made over £lOO,OOO by the deal. Mac-
quarie had the place built for an hospital—the
Rum Hospital—but Gipps turned one wing into a
Parliament House, and located there a Rum Par-
liament.
Prime Minister Deakin—Alfred the Affable
—has been wasting time and silver eloquence, and
wants also to waste £25,000 of good Australian
money, on an image of the late Queen Victoria in
London. Apart from all other considerations,
doesn’t the Opposition furnish sufficient obstruc-
tion without Deakin blocking his own business
with hours of his own beautiful eloquence about
statues ?
The House of Reps, is getting along very
slowly with the debate on the proposed address to
Edward VII. in favor of Home Rule for Ireland,
and though the cause is a good one, and the pro-
posal was started with the very best intentions, it
seems a pity that the Reps, don’t stick to their
own business. Australia’s affairs are far enough
in arrear to require all the time and attention
available.
Maoriland Farmers’ Union has within the
last few months decided (1) that the country can’t
do without a heavy protective duty on wheat;
(2) that it is none of its business to help the
machinery workers to get such a duty on agricul-
tural machinery as will enable the local manu-
facturer to stand up against the American trust.
The Farmers’ Union is a consistent animal—a
, consistently selfish beast.
In the Carruthers-Wade administration of
* the N.S.W. Arbitration Act, the Labor party is
getting a splendid lesson on the folly of playing
the ■ “ third - party,” not - wanting - office game.
Democratic acts can be made or marred by
administration, and tfie party that professes not
to want office and to scorn alliances leading to
office, is fighting its battle with an empty gun—
quite an elegant-looking gun, but as empty as a
, disused rail vay tunnel.
The Victorian Minister of Agriculture has
> obtained a return showing that certain bits of
i Government land, allegedly suitable for closer
< settlement, are lying, little-used, at Olangolah,
) Buckrabanvule, Garraragarmungee, Dartagook,
iKonnepra, Wontliaggi, Gooramgooramgong,
IBumbang, Tallygaroopna, and Yanac-a-Yanac.
The names alone would terrify immigrants, but
. the Australian, who is used to going out and fight-
ing dreadful polysyllables in the wilderness, is
inquiring about these places.
According to Moscow Slovo, M. Witte
carried through the peace negotiations at Ports-
mouth (U.S.A.) on poker lines :
Fortunately I succeeded in holding out to the cad.
The Japanese could not read in my face what was passing
jin my heart. From the outset I assumed such an indif-
ferent tone that it eventually carried conviction. When
•the Japanese presented their written conditions, I laid
ithe matter aside without looking at them, and spoke of
something else. On leaving the room, I intentionally
tforgot the conditions lying on the table. When one of
the Japanese plenipotentiaries drew my attention to this,
asking if I did not wish to take away secret documents
which someone might read, I pub the papers carelessly
into my pocket. It was thus to the last minute of the
negotiations. *
“ F.C.” writes
If any private company, similar to the Canadian
Pacific R.R. Co., were to-day offered the chance to build
and work an Australian transcontinental railway—east to
west and north to south —its first demand would as-
suredly take the shape of a huge land-grant—alternative
miiles reserved to it all along the line. Why not give the
•Commonwealth the same concession ? Westralia has
already granted one private company similar rights, and
South Australia offered a like chance a while back in
, connection with its cross-country line.
Who gives the “royal assent”? Senator
Matheson (W.A.) wants to know how the Go-
vernor-General could have bestowed the alleged
substance on Supply Bill No. 3 on Sept. 28, when
on that day he was off the coast of Westralia —in
fact, he was not on Australian soil at all. The
Minister in reply could not account for it unless
the G.-G. was in two places at once. Perhaps
when the Governor-General goes away from Mel-
bourne he leaves a quantity of royal assents behind
him to go on with.
It is cabled that Germany and Austria
have agreed to jointly occupy Russian Poland if
the revolution there gets out of hand. The last
time Austria occupied any place jointly with
Kaiser William’s country was about 40 years ago
when the two armies took possession of Schleswig-
Holstein. Prussia took all the loot then. Also it
took Hanover, and licked Austria at Sadowa, and
feeling refreshed by the exercise it next took
Alsace and Lorraine. He needs a very long spoon
who sups with a very large devil.
The last batch of Australian converts whom
Preacher Dowie roped in for Zion City came
within an ace of being excluded from the United
States under the suspicion that they were laborers
under contract to work for Dowie. They got in
after much delay. A deaf passenger by the same
vessel was blocked most emphatically until certain
relatives guaranteed that he wouldn’t become a
public burden. The Tory crowd, which always
asserts that the U.S. welcomes everybody without
question, might make a note of this.
It might be worth while for the N.S.W.
Lands Commission to inquire why some things
didn’t happen as well as why things did happen.
After some of the resumed areas of far western
holdings were attached to the leasehold areas,
applications were made to excise portions (as the
law provided) for purposes of settlement. In one
case, at least, the excision was recommended by
the Land Board, and went on to the Minister, but,
though intending settlers swore they wanted the
land and were prepared to take it, the land was
never made available. Probably there were other
similar cases.
RAISING THE
SPECTRE—
FROM ITS AP-
PROPRIATE
HIDING PLACE.
“ F.C.” writes :
Vic. Judge Molesworth lately put anew aspect to the
question of extending meicy to the offender who pleads
that he has a small wife and a large family : “ I cannot,
for the life of me, see,” said Molesworth, “ why a bachelor
should receive a heavier sentence than a , ” who has a
number of children.” And no one e'-’s c ... . e it. The
only difference between the two is that t>- jugged father
should be made to earn at least £2 a week in gaol for the
support of his children, while the bachelor should also be
compelled to earn £2 a week, but as he has no children
10s. a week might be put away as a bonus payable to him
on release, while the gaol could declare a dividend with
the other 30s. A dividend-paying gaol would be at least
a novelty,
Ex-Premier Daglish, of Westralia, has
thrown up the Labor party because he dqesn’t
believe in the caucus and in the non-alienation of
public lands, and a few other Labor planks, and
he can’t conscientiously stand on a platform that
he doesn’t believe in. The party had the same
platform when Daglish joined it; also it had the
same platform when he accepted the first Labor
Premiership. Apparently Daglish didn’t mind
getting 'nto politics by swallowing things he didn’t
belie' l; it is only when he has made a nest for
hims-.i hat he can’t consent to “ waive his objec-
tions" and be a Judas any longer. Daglish seems
to think that he is called a Judas for forsaking the
party. Wherein Daglish is wrong—he was a
Judas, according to his own showing, when he
joined the party.
The Sea Carriage of Gooch Act, when
passed by the Federal Parliament, was, in the
eyes of the Bruce Smiths, a tyrannous measure,
certain to injuriously affect the shipper. Now
that it has had a fair trial comes this result.
Mr. J. B. Brewer, secretary of the Inter-State
Fruitgrowers’ Conference, and of the Victorian
Shippers’ Association, told the Select Committee
on shipping :
The Sea Carriage of Goods Act had had an excellent
result. Since it was passed, not a single shipment of
perishable products had been landed in bad condition.
Instead of freights being raised, as had been prophesied,
they had been reduced, and fruitgrowers had received a
great advantage all round from the Federal Act.
Sydney Telegraph item re the N.S.W.
Local Government Bill: —
The expensive burlesque of one man, by irrelevant and
inconsequential talk, keeping the whole House idle and
deliberately sticking up the country’s work, can have no
place in the programme of any Reform Government, and
with the closure rule at hand it ought not to be tolerated
for a single moment.
Will the Deakin party in the Australian Parlia-
ment make a note of this, and hasten to get a
closure rule that will prevent Australia’s business
being bogged by the senseless obstruction of Reid,
Cook, Conroy, .Johnson, Kelly, and *-he two
awful, blatant, howling Smiths?
In a recent lecture on Immigration Dr.
Arthur, M.L.A., told a Sydney audience that he
was “in entire sympathy with those who were
antagonistic to trades union dictation.’’ A strange
sentiment for a man who belongs to the closest
union (bar the one that Bruce Smith belongs to) m
the world. The British Medical Association
“dictates” to all its members, and any medico
who does not obey the “ dictation ” is looked upon
as a blackleg, and will not be met in consultation
by unionists. He is a pariah, an outcast, a boy-
cotted man—all by reason of trades unionism.
In the Victorian Assembly a Bill has been
introduced taking away from a dead man the
power to leave his widow and children to starve
a power which no live man has. It provides that
the maintenance of a deceased’s family may be
made the first charge on his estate, whatever his
last will declares. In practically all the States
now such a proposal is being made —an absolutely
just proposal, endorsed by the common law cus-
tom of most civilised countries. Unfortunately,
the Federation hasn’t Probate jurisdiction, or one
Commonwealth Act might put all Australia in a
line with common sense in this regard.
The Opium Smoking Prohibition Bill,
now before the Victorian Assembly, is very brief
in spots. For instance, consider the beautiful
simplicity of clause 11.: —
No person shall smoke opium.
Much might be done by prohibiting the importa-
tion of opium; by making its manufacture a
Government monopoly as in India ; by selling it
to chemists only; and providing a heavy minimum
and a very heavy maximum punishment for any
chemist who retails it except a 3 part of the
prescription of a qualified medico, and for any
other person who sells it at all, or gives it away,
or smuggles it, or infringes the Government
monopoly of manufacture. The off-hand state-
ment, “No person shall smoke opium,” is also a
quite desirable statement, but it suggests passing a
Health Act with the clause “ No person shall fall
down dead.” Come to think of it, no person
ought to fall down dead. It is a beastly habit.
W.A. Labor bodies are
already getting work for the
Federal elections. The
tide is setting against
Labor in State politics,
but in the bigger Fede-
ral electorates the or-
ganisation of the
party should enable
it to hold its
ground. The Sen-
ate seats in a
vast State like
Westralia can-
not be won
without a
widespread
organisa-
tion, and
the Labor
party is the
only party
that fills
the bill in
that re-
s p e c t.
Pearce is a
certainty
for re-elec-
t i o n, and
may be able
to carry two
colleagues
back with him,
though the men
they would dis-
place are both
rather radical. For
the House of Reps,
things will probably
remain as they are.
There are no more
seats to be won unless
John Forrest can be
ejected, and, on present
reckoning, none to be lost.
A word from an exile in
S’Africa; —
Hope you will keep hammering away at Protection and
Land-tax. When they come, some of us poor homesick
Australians will be able to get back again.
Not long since the Brisbane municipal
windbags wrathfully declared that if the Govern-
ment did not hand up a larger vote they would
kick the Art Gallery pictures out of the garret of
the Town Hall into the street. Premier Morgan
coolly invited the ejection, for several country
towns offered to provide accommodation free.
The ire of the aldermen cooled off at that point,
and there was peace. But now that the Govern-
ment proposes to house the collection in the long
room of the gorgeous Lands building, the Council
refuses to let the pictures go until its claim for
extra rent is paid, declaring that £SO a year was
not enough. It is so like a Council to demand
payment for the storage of Art as if it were hay or
ironware.
A letter from the North : —•
The success of mining director Pauli in the Charters
Towers election has given the extreme wing of the Queens-
land Labor party the roughest shock yet encountered. It
is a clear manifestation that those who put the interests
of Socialism before those of Labor are doomed to failure
these times. Until the Objective was adopted, and the
Worker flogged the supporters of those extreme planks
along the bogg’y road, Bananaland looked like securing
many reforms to which it was justly entitled. Mullan,
who resigned his job in the post office to carry the Labor
flao- was the first to sign the Convention’s platform
adopted this year, and his defeat seems to foreshadow the
downfall of ail who subscribe to it. There are only about
six members in the Assembly who barrack for it, and they
now see the folly of their project. Had the whole of the
party fallen in with Kerr’s recent manifesto it would have
been plain sailing, and the Towers electors would have
remained loyal. Pauli, by the way, looks like becoming
a Morganite, if his manifesto can be taken as a guide,
although he has gone in as an Independent.
That solid Tory, Knox-of-the-Hat, M.H.R.,
tried to undermine Attorney-General Isaacs’
Secret Commissions Bill with an amendment that
the secret commission should only be illegal when
given with “corrupt” intent. Seeing that there
would never be an entry in the day-book or cash-
book to the effect that the commission was given
with corrupt intent, nqr would the item be posted
to corruption account in the ledger, it would be in
only one swindle out of 1000 that “ corrupt intent ”
could be proved. Attorney-General Isaacs didn’t
share Knox-of-the-Hat’s sympathy with under-
hand dodges, and The Hat’s amendment was
rejected. If it had been carried the next crowd of
Butter Frauds would have escaped like the last
lot, for through all that tortuous swindle “ corrupt
intent” wasn’t legally proved once. For that
matter it is very often hard to prove violent intent
on the part of the person who kicks yo.u in the
street. It may be absent-mindedness or nervous
contraction of the leg. The law has to take some
things for granted, else Knox and his Hat would
never get down the street alive.
The Q. farmers who bought holdings on
one of the re-purchased-for-closer-settlement
estates find that the prices they paid were so high
that they now want more time to meet instal-
ments. So a clause has been tacked on to the new
Land Bill making the settlers’ terms easier. Once
again, there is only one wise system of closer
settlement —progressive land taxation.
This is Melbourne Argus of October 9 ex-
patiating on how capital is not being driven out of
Australia, but is rather growing and accumu-
lating :
The increase of deposits held, during the past year over
the previous one, by the Australian banks amounted to
six and a half millions sterling, . . . deposits in the
Savings banks grew from £18,500,000 in ’94 to £34,500,000
in ’OS. . . The assets of insurance companies also increased
from £19,700,000 in ’93 to £34,500,000 in ’O4. . . The
Board of Works issues during the last eleven years
amounted to about five millions sterling, and the Mel-
bourne portion of the State’s public debt has during the
same period been augmented by four and a half millions,
so it is evident that Australian dependence on British
capital is passing away.
And much more to the same effect. Yet next
week the Argus will [again remark, from sheer
force of habit, that capital is being driven out ot
the country by Socialistieflegislation.
America provides another lesson in the
economics of cheap colored labor. The cotton
plantations in the U.S.A. imported negro slaves
because they were “ cheap and reliable.” The idea
of slavery in time revolted the democratic senti-
ment, and the nigger was freed. Now he is no
longer cheap and reliable, and to keep the cotton
industry going the white man’s brains have come
to the rescue with a cotton-picker. Two of the
machines will do nine men’s work, and give a
better staple. This machine brings nearer the
White Australia cotton-field, and emphasises again
that cheap colored labor involves stagnation,
wjiile reasonably-paid white labor means inven-
tion and progress.
More Socialism ! Major-General French,
returning to Australia on a visit, impresses as the
first maxim of defence that the Commonwealth
should establish its own ammunition _ factories.
And he gives “private enterprise” this blow on
the point:—
The interest of Government officials would be to make
good cartridges. The interest of contractors is to make
profit. L t the Government contract for anything it
likes, but do let us have good powder and good arnniu-
on.
And, if it comes to that, why not have a good
fleet, and a good army, and a good mail-boat line
on the same principles ? Why not have as many
good things as we can ?
Jellicoe, the Maoriland lawyer who lately
joined the critics of Australia, has broken out
afresh. Being invited by N.S.W. Agent-General
Coghlan to “give the name of one person of the
British race who, not being a criminal or mentally
or physically infirm, was ref used admission to Aus-
tralia,” the infuriated six-and-eightpenny person
respoiided :
Only the other day a blind British tourist, travelling
round the world with his daughter, was refused a landing.
Seeing that everybody knows the blind tourist
ivasn’t refused a landing here (though he certainly,
by his own accounts, had a bad time at San
Francisco) this kind of lie seems hardly worth
arguing with. It looks an incurable case. Jellicoe
also breaks out violently re that half-breed
Egyptian who was arrested here, for theft and put
to the education test as an undesirable immigrant,
and in Jellicoe’s version of the case he becomes
a most respectable German immigrant who Was
wantonly put through the education test in the
Greek language to bowl him out. •
King O’Malley, M.H.R., advocates build-
ing a Commonwealth mail fleet with borrowed
money, the loan to carry a 2 per cent, sinking
fund, which will be sufficient to extinguish it in
34 years. In view of which suggestion it almost
seems as if the Commonwealth mail fleet idea
might get on better if it wasn’t blessed with the
support of the Hairy Terror with the Large Hat.
Mail boats don’t last 34 years, and under
O’Malley’s scheme, which seems to provide for
nothing more than 2 per cent, of a lav-by, the
debt would last much longer than the ships. If
the Federal vessels are built with borrowed money
there should be a renewal fund of at least 5 per
cent, to accumulate at compound interest. Then
if a sinking fund of 2 per cent, were
added (making 7 per cent, in all) to wipe out the
original debt, the concern should, in a few years,
be a highly profitable enterprise. Of course there
might be a few years of uphill work, but what
enterprise worth the name is not an up-grade job
at first ?
The dispute between Anderson —the Syd-
ney hat man who wants to import more hatters—
on the one side and the Hatters’ Union on the
other still continues, and it is difficult to accurately
sort out the circumstances amid much confusion of
statement. But two solid facts remain all the
time : (1) If we had a tariff high enough to shut
out imports of foreign hats, we would make all our
own hats. (2) If we made all our own hats, we
would have room for hundreds of new hatters
without depriving a single existing hatter of his
job. In Maoriland the Labor men went in for
tolerably high Protection, and so they haven’t
required a contract labor clause as yet. The Aus-
tralian Labor party sank the fiscal issue, and
made no attempt to increase employment, so it
requires a contract labor clause to prevent the
poor little scrap of work being swamped by too
many workers, and it is even driven to talk of
cutting the working day down to six hours to
make the scrap go round.

A Word About Testimonials.
Theib Value. Why One Cabbies Moke
Weight than Anotheb.
Behind every printed testimonial of a cure
effected by Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills there
are thousands of others unprinted. Tens of thou-
sands of men and women. have testified to the
cures of Scrofula, Sores, Pimples, Boils and
Blotches, Eczema, and Rheuniatism (caused
by the blood’s impurities) through the use
of this remedy. If the fact that Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills purify the blood
was required to be proved in a court of law,
and one thousand witnesses were waiting to
testify, justice would have no use for nine
hundred and ninety-seven witnesses of the
thousand ; it would call two or three representa-
tive witnesses, and on their evidence the case
would be decided. Those who witness to the
blood-purifying power of Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills are reputable, reliable and respon-
sible people, whose testimony would carry
weight in any court of law in the land. It
should carry weight with you. It is one of the
contradictions of human nature that people who
believe “that all men are created of one blood”
belie their own belief in practice. If John
Smith testifies to a cure, little notice is taken of
the fact; if Senator somebody is cured of a
boil, then the medicine must be all right; yet
blood is the same in King and Kaiser, Prince
and Peasant, Senator and Tramp. It is made in
the same way, of digested food ; it is circulated by
the same mechanism. If an emperor’s blood is
impure he will have boils or some other eruption,
like the commonest of his subjects. The medicine
that will purify the blood of somebody, will purify
the blood of anybody. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills purify the blood, anybody’s blood, every-
body’s blood. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are
a positive and permanent cure for biliousness,
constipation, indigestion, headaches, sallow com-
plexion, liver and kidney troubles, piles, pimples,
boils and blotches, and for female ailments.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Bulletin hereby publishes its tip for the
Caulfield Cup. This is without prejudice to any tip sup-
plied in this column by the paper’s sporting writers. It
has nothing to do with weight, age, form, or past re-
cords, and it is supplied by a section of the staff which
just about knows a horse from a bullock. The typist fur-
nished the names of the horses, each on a separate piece
of paper. The office boy supplied the sugar and sprinkled
it on the papers, and opened the window to let in the
flies, and the sub-editor kindly audited the results. Going
by the order in which the flies settled on the papers, the
result of the Caulfield Cup will be •
(1) Marmont.
(2) Boabdil.
(3) The fly declined to commit himself.
* • * *
The Caulfield Guineas result seemed to settle
any doubts as to the inferiority of the Australian 3-year-
olds that ran at Randwick last month. Lady Wallace
then appeared to be the best of a bad lot, judged by her
running behind the Maorilanders, and on Saturday the
filly made no trouble of winning the Guineas from Dant-
zic, Scotland, and Charles Stuart. Of these, the last-
named is the least unlikely to turn the tables in the
V.R.C. Derby, a race which might have proved a soft
thing for Torah, had the S. Australian colt been entered
for it. Lady Wallace’s time was not good. Dandalla,
with Overdale at his neck, beat it in the Toorak Handi-
cap, over the same distance.
• * * *
Probably the winner of the Caulfield Cup was
seen out last Saturday in the Stakes, or the Toorak Han-
dicap. Handsome little Torah, in spite of a bump from
Marvel Loch, won the 9-furlongs event quite brilliantly—
a marked improvement on his performance of the previous
week, when Gladsome showed him the way home. This
time the flying mare was not herself, or she lay off too
long. Anyhow, she finished third, a length behind
Marvel Loch, and the layers of odds howled bitterly. It
would have been interesting to see whether Torah could
have cut down Gladsome as slickly as he passed
the other mare. But the champion was never
in the lead. Another disappointment was Emir.
The big rebel, after behaving decently at the post,
got all the worst of a bad start, and wouldn’t
try to make up the lost ground. The blinkers that made
him more tractable whilst they were a novelty to him are
no longer effective with Emir. He is eternally cocking
his head in an artful attempt to see what’s going on from
behind his blinkers, and in the Cup he will perhaps be
relieved of them. Emir looks harder than he ever looked
of yore, and on the track he has done some very impres-
sive work.
* * * *
Taking ten of them against the field for the
Caulfield Cup, this scribe will name Emir, Boabdil, Marvel
Loch, Overdale, Scot Free, Step Out, Torah, Florin,
Demas and Troytown. With the exception of Step
Out they all have a chance on “form,” ancient
or modern, and Step Out —hitherto regarded as
a non-stayer—is said to be a greatly improved animal.
Nevertheless, his pedigree suggests that he will fail when
the pinch comes. Of the top-weights, Overdale, a pretty
good stayer, has a chance on his running in the Toorak.
Marvel Loch is distinctly less tempting than Torah.
Emir, on account of his temper, is only worth backing at
about 20 to 1. Of course he could give his backers a great
show for their money. Last year (with 9st. 41b. up) he
led the field into the straight, and was beaten by
only the light-burdened Murmur and by Acrasia,
the subsequent Melbourne Cup winner. Up to a
mile and a-half Emir is always a dangerous horse
of a different class from most of them that go to
make up a Caulfield Cup field and help to bring about mis-
haps in this tragical-historical jostle. But the book
gives little encouragement to fancy heavy-weights.
Seventeen times in 21 years the stake has gone to some-
thing that carried less than Bst., and as a rule the runner-
up has also been leniently handicapped. Torah, Florin,
Scot Free, and Step Out are included in the more likely
division. On the assumption that his brief experience of
hurdle-racing (he beat York and Marmont at Flemington)
may have much benefited old Florin, and because he is a
more reasonable investment at the price than some of the
better favorites, this tip is
Florin
Torah
Emir,
and may the Lord have mercy on the soul of the rash
prophet!

The scratching of Revenue for the Melbourne
Cup—by an odd coincidence Revenue aud Dividend were
struck out on the same afternoon—silenced a number,of
fatuous know-alls. Revenue had made three or four public
appearances of late without suggesting that he could beat
the proverbial donkey. The once-brilliant horse—ruined
for racing purposes by the shocking damages he suffered
in the Australian Cup three and a half years ago—was
consistently outpaced in moderate company, bubthe evi-
dence of his deterioration went for nothing with some
people. They winked and nodded mysteriously. It is a
painful reflection on Australian turf tactics and Australian
turf government that even the least reasonable “ mugs ” *
could have thought it possible for anybody’s gee-gee to
make the startling improvement in “form” they expected
from Revenue. In this case—as it happened—they had
no excuse for expecting anything of the sort. Revenue
certainly was “ saved ” for a whole year before winning
the Melbourne Cup, but he didn’t run any byes previous
to the coup.

Seems that the V.R.C. committee last November
acted on a Bulletin suggestion re the foolishness of the
Blue Ribbon ceremony, which had. hitherto been per-
formed by a vice-regal lady to the great annoyance of the
Derby winner. Sylvanite, last year’s winner, expressed
his objection to the Ribbon mummery by breaking away
from custody and bolting into the “Birdcage” without,
as it happened, doing any damage. A fortnight later the
V.R.C. committee passed a resolution “ that the Derby
ribbon shall not be put round the horse’s neck in future,
but shall be handed to the winner.” But the resolution
was kept dark until Wren suggested the possibility of his
horse, Pius, winning the next Derby, and wanted to know
whether the decoration act would be performed in that
case. The new rule won’t be welcome 'to the
committee should Pius do the trick. Their chairman or
Lady Northcote will be called upon to hand the ribbon
to Wren, who is no longer allowed to nominate horses for
any races at V.R.C. meetings.
The Australian turf—which mostly means the
turf in Sydney, Melbourne, and sometimes Adelaide—is
badly in need of one or two very commanding owners and
strikingly successful jockeys. No colors and mounts are
followed with half the confidence that Mr. James White
and Tom Hales inspired in days of yore. The public
want something to swear by these times, when they get
So much to swear at. In Maoriland the racing community
has a solid respect for G. G. Stead’s horses, but no owner
hereabouts keeps up his average like Stead. Given the
right man with the right horses, the trouble would be to
get fair play for them in races where “ interference ” is
usually an important factor in the result. If the V.R.C.
“reforms” included active and drastic measures against
interference, a punter’s money would go further and fare
better than it does under the present lax management;
but in the meantime there are half-a-dozen difficulties in
the way of raising the tone of jockeyship, and one of
them is that Ikey Mo. lives within easy distance of metro-
politan racing stables, and is in close and constant com-
munication with most of the jockeys.
The handiest little reference book for the
current racing is “The Federal Turf Guide,” published by
Williams and Co., of Bear Alley, Melbourne. It is replete
with up-to-date information as to the horses competing
in the two Cups.*

The N.S.W. Cricket Association has decided to
give the inter-State cricket fixture against Queensland
another chance. The chance it has had since 1893 has
already cost the N.S.W. body over £lOOO. The Queens-
land Association periodically grumbles because the event
is only ranked as a second-rate one, but Queensland
hasn’t scored a win since 1893, and it looks as if it will be
long before it defeats a N.S.W. second team, let alone
does serious damage to a first one.

South Australia saw some fearsome bowling on
Saturday. Travers, 4 for 49 ; Hutton, 4 for 46 ; and Hay,
3 for 18. This was on a wet wicket, amid falling rain.
* * * *
Sydney cricket continued under conditions that
were eminently favorable for football, the ground having
been soaked by rain on Saturday morning. In the after-
noon, about 4 p.m., it began to get a bit “soft,” as the
Highlanders say in Gaelic, and first grade cricket degen-
erated into mud-larking pure and simple. Paddington
and Gordon were unable to play at all at Hampden Park,
and the match was declared a draw on the previous
Saturday’s play, when Paddington bad made 221, and
Gordon had one wicket down for 18. Burwood, which
had made 358 for the loss of one wicket the previous
Saturday, declared at that ; and on the soaked ground
Glebe went in and managed to keep going, losing only
four wickets for 151, and thus saved its pork. Central
Cumberland downed Sydney District by 154 runs
on the first innings. Waverley’s win by 209
runs against Middle Harbor was also a first
innings defeat, and hideous at that. Middle Harbor
will begin to regret leaving the sheltering wing of North
Sydney. North Sydney, which had declared at 341
for seven wickets, had the mortification of being unable
to finish off University on account of the rain ; Uni. made
91 for the loss of four, and drew. Balmain, which had
totted up 335 in the first innings, beat Redfern by 257,
Redfern making only a poor 78.
It was a bowlers’ day, and the best figures were
as follows : Cronan, of Central Cumberland, scooped six
for 46 ; Newell, of Waverley, five for 35 ; and Meagher, of
the same club, four for 16. Hordern, of North Sydney,
raked in a couple of wickets for seven runs. But the
daddy of the day was Robson, of Balmain, who took eight
wickets for 20 runs.
* * * *
Kerim of Redfern, a fat, dusky trundler of
Syrian nationality, with an abnormal off-break, quick
from the pitch, threatens to emulate Aboriginal Marsh.
Recently he took 11 wickets for 62. But he may as well
spare his energies if the experiences of the other colored
brother are anything to go by.
Bananaland cricketers are enthusiastic over the
discovery of a leg-break bowler named Crowe, whom they
loudly acclaim as the best trundler the State has produced
for years. It is hoped that Crowe will lift the Bananaland
team into a first-class position in the fight for the
Sheffield Shield. Just now the chief danger is that all
this frantic adulation may bring Crowe to an untimely
end, by causing his head to swell and overbalance him so
that he will have to bowl lying down.
* * * *
Billiardists whose nerves are not strung up to
the ordinary professional pitch should read, mark and
digest the story of the final game for the Vic. amateur
championship, played by Tricks and Haley. In the first
half of the game (1000 points) Haley got such a command-
ing lead that his opponent became desperate. The case
looked hopeless for him, and, having practically lost all
anxiety as to winning, he bucked up. Presently it was
Haley’s turn to feel nervous—the awful nervousness of
the man who lias counted on a certain victory, and sees
the cert, diminishing. The stern-chaser continued to
come along until it was “ anybody’s game.” Then they
became equally anxious, and Tricks won by 16 points.
One may get too long a lead from a well-matched oppo-
nent. it is the moderate monotonous lead that keeps the
chaser in trouble all the time, and finally breaks his
heart. If he gets on terms once in a way during a long
game, only to be outpaced again the next minute, he
grows weary of the chase, as a rule.
The billiard match between Memmott and
Smith (who received 1000 in 9000) drew satisfactory atten-
dances to Alcock’s Hall, Melbourne, and gave a suffi-
ciently interesting display of talent on both sides. But
there was no appearance of deadly earnestness in the
work. Memmott, in particular, played a careless game,
whilst Smith seemed to “ play to the gallery ” sometimes,
as though he were not deeply interested in the result.
Anyway the general “form” of the N.S.W. champion
didn’t suggest that he would have an even-money chance
on the handicap if both men were bent on beating one
another. Memmott at times played in the more masterly
style, and a start of 11 per cent, is not enough when the
scratch man has a distinct advantage over his opponent.

“ Bendigonian ” : I see announced the death in
Victoria of Charles Bird, ex-world champion runner.
Old sports will remember the good old times of the early
. ’Seventies, when we were visited by the trio of champions
—Hewitt, Bird, and Topley. I see again the old Bendigo
Cricket Ground as it was when Bird had his last run
there. Though reckoned among the best of local sprinters,
I could but gaze and wonder at that run. Two Australians
were pitted against him over the 10 miles, the one to
relieve the other at the half-distance. The “ Geordies ”
had the tip direct that Bird was to lose, and they were
in high glee at the prospective haul. From the pistol he
fell into his machine-like stride. Had there been relays
for each mile, matters might have been close ; as it was,
we were treated to a show of the cat playing with the
mice. The last mile entered, Bird was considerably in
the rear, but what need for anxiety? Who can
bide his finish ? Two laps to go and there is
little change. The runners are rounding for home,
and now Bird sets out for his famous last hun-
dred yards—an llsec. man in spite of his ten miles.
In a flash the race is over, and Bird remains the hero of
the day. Now, however, a sterner race awaits him.
Financial loss and indignation overcome admiration in
the “ Geordies,” and they sec out for the runner’s scalp.
Round the cricket ground he darts again, this time
dodging infuriated pursuers. Little hope for Bird should
he fall into their clutches ! He sees an opening, vaults
a fence, and is soon clear of the ground. Down the road
he flies, the yelling aud ever-augmenting mob at his
heels. By this time several miles have been added to the
ten, and even Bird begins to tire. He hails a cab and at
once makes for an asylum, which he finds in the gaol.
That was the last time I saw Bird run —an example of
endurance the like of which I cannot hope to see again.

Some of “ Tatt.’s ” customers complain that a
remittance of ss. 6d. for a ss. 2d. ticket doesn’t invari-
ably bring a “ result ” sheet in addition to the ticket. In
other words, they complain that Tatt. “has’’them for
twopence. And when the disheartened investor finds
that the ticket drew a blank he (or she) gets an uneasy
feeling that it was a no-good ticket from the start, and
his (or her) envelope for the result sheet was treated as an
unnecessary thing. Whereas, if the ticket turns out a
£5 prize-winner, the neglected owner suspects that he (or
she) wasn’t intended to claim the fiver. She is more sus-
picious than he.

The short brief day of publicity for the crack
rifle shot is here again, and the papers are full of the
results of his fierce attacks on the patient immovable
target—results brought about by the expert use of
verniers, wind gauges, patent sights, and the rest of the
portmanteau-full of tricks he carts to the battlefield. The
worst of this is that when the time comes for the crack
rifle brigade to be of use, the enemy will have settled the
argument while he is sorting out his tricks in an endeavor
to get the range.

Sydney Sailing Club’s opening race was a dreary,
weary affair. There was practically no wind, save a few
brief, capricious puffs. Of the dozen boats that started
only four managed to get over the full course, and most
of the onlookers left for home while the race was but
half over. The winner, Australian, only managed to
finish 45see. inside the allotted time. Keriki and Federal
were second and third respectively, but as they did not
finish by 7 p.m. they get no prizes.

Much the same crowd that will patronise the
imitation Henley a few weeks hence lined Yarra banks
last Saturday to watch another imitation English function
to decide which college shall entitle itself “ Head of the
River.” Previous day Wesley College had defeated
Scotch College, and Melbourne Grammar School had
walloped the Geelong ditto team ; so, on Saturday, some
15,000 folk yelled and hurrahed while Wesleys slowly
forged ahead down stream and passed the post just two
feet ahead of Melbourne Grammar. The race was an
exciting sensation, a nose and nose struggle all down the
course. Also, over the lower Yarra regulation course,
champion sculler P. C. Ivens maintained his right to the
title for the fifth year in succession, his sole opponent
being R. Adam, of theM.R.C., who was defeated some-
what easily by a length and a half, in rather slow time.

Sydney City Council now offers the City Bowl
ing Club a lease of its green for £1 a week instead of £2
as asked before. The bowlers, relying mostly on the
revenue from the bar, have threatened to accept a lease
on this rental. But the Liquor Bill, now before N.S.W.
Assembly, promises to interfere seriously with the bar
trade of the bowling clubs, and, if passed, the City
bowlers will have hard work to make the rent. Conse-
quently the aspirations of the local billy-goat to chew the
local jam-tin on the one spot in Woolloomooloo that has
hitherto been kept sacred from him are not altogether
damped.

The Pioneer Motor Cycling Club is evidently
not a whale for road-racing, only eight out of 20 entrants
facing the starter for the Goulburn to Ashfield (123 miles)
last week. The winner, N. G. Saunders, rode a 3£ h.p.
Minerva over the distance in sh. 12min.—an average of
24 miles an hour—which, come to think of it, is not an
almighty lot faster than big Jack Arnst’s time on a
purely leg-pushed machine for the Goulburn-Sydney run.

Record-breakers grow in all climates, appa-
rently. Hitherto, the South American has not loomed
big as a sport. Some of him have put up records for
awful fighting (of the hand-to-hand variety practised in
the Middle Ages), and that and money-making seem to
have been the only games in which he shone. However,
quite recently a South American who bears the curiously
French-sounding name of Petit-Breton attacked the one
hour unpaced cycle track record, established by Yankee
rider Hamilton. Breton burst it, and the new record is
25 miles 969yds. for the 60min.
* * * *
Two of the riders in the recent Warrnambool-
Melbourne bike race are said to have pedalled their
machines from Omeo to Warrnambool (400 miles), and
then taken part in the big race. This sort of thing is
proving of much more interest than path-racing, and but
for the fact that no one has invented any method of col-
lecting “gate” for road-racing, pedalling round the saucer
track would be as dead as Julius Caesar.
* * * *
Another fortnight and the Summer Nights
Cycling Carnival will be in full blast, and already the rush
of foreign cyclists has commenced. Ivor Lawson and
Floyd MacFarland are already here, each boasting of
appropriating both the Orient Plate and the Wheel Race.
Andersen, the Dane, is on the road, accompanied by a
Russian and a Hollander, who will probably be called
Bear and Kruger (or Dutchy) by the irreverent crowd.
Behind them Dickentmann, with his pacers, his wind
shields, his collision mats, and his'patent track sliders is
blocking the ocean way. It is evident that by the time
the really big prizes are on the board the Australian
riders will have to battle against the world’s best for
their own money. Ivor Lawson says the Australian
prizes are better than any offered in the U.S.A. Last
year, the Vic. League of Wheelmen, which has just ended
its financial year with a balance of £9l, gave away £5261
in prize money at 143 race meetings. And N.S.W. League
probably shells out an even larger amount ; so by the
time the foreigner has pecked at all the pools from Sydney
to Perth he has gambled for a heap of coin.
« * * *
Next month’s cycling carnival at Sydney
Cricket Ground is expected to eclipse all previous dis-
plays. The track is to be fitted with improved lighting
apparatus, which will make the riders’ lot somewhat
easier, although there has been little to complain of in
that direction. "* The plums of the November meeting
will be the Sydney Wheel Race (£5O) and the Orient
Plate, the first prize of which is £3O. The only foreign
riders so far spoken of are Ivor Lawson and Floyd
MacFarland, both of whom are expected to be here in
time for the opening. It is announced also that Don
Walker will postpone his retirement till after the
November Carnival, and if he finds that his legs have not
lost their cunning he may possibly further delay the sad
occurrence.
* * * •
N.S.W. League of Wheelmen is stretching forth
its paw with a view to taking control of motoring as well
as wheeling, and allowing only motorists registered with
it to compete in f tndard events. The League will be
well advised if it le as motoring alone—it has more than
it can properly ma ;e with cycling, and if it gets leaving
its reputation in tLj track of motor-cars and motor-bikes
it will get hurt, sure.
* * •» *
N.S.W. League of Wheelmen is going to
pamper the “foreign” bike riders as greatly as ever
during the coming season. For instance, the entry of
“ foreign ” riders for the race meeting opening- on
November 1 is left till the opening night of the carnival,
whereas the Australian riders must nominate on the 21st
instant. Also, in connection with the Sydney Thousand
Carnival next March, the Australians must enter on
January 27, but the “ foreign ” rider won’t be required to
put his entry in until February 17.

“Snell”: At the third time of asking, Wren
permitted the footballing novices’ slugging tournament
to come to a finish at the Democratic Hall, Melbourne,
the other evening, and the finish was a dramatic; jerk.
Moriarty, of Fitzroy, and Livingstone, of North Mel-
bourne, were left to settle the one remaining difference,
and it was thought a dead certainty for Moriarty. But
Livingstone, a longer, larger man, plunged in with a right
swing in the first half-minute, and Moriarty’s jaw was
there. When Moriarty returned to the pale glimpses of
the electric lights, he was a whipped man, and Livingstone
was £5O in. The brightest feature of the engagement
was the glad smile that slowly elongated on the pale,
nervous face of Livingstone as it dawned upon him that his
dreaded enemy was not going to rise to the occasion.
Never was so much joy and so much amazement blended
in a mere human grin. Wren, the new Providence of the
pugilist, scooped the income from three fat audiences
over this tournament. The winner took £5O, which will
about pay modest training expenses, and for that he
fought three fights. Obviously the Wren knows whose
nest to feather and how to feather it.

The Bert Murphy-Papworth Sullivan scrap at
Sydney Gaiety Club was a curious business. Sullivan is
about as graceful as a hippopotamus drinking cham-
pagne, and he squares up in a style all his own. But his
left was very sudden, and for four rounds it took Murphy
all he knew to keep away from annihilation. Then Sulli-
van’s left frying-pan sprung a leak, or got damaged some-
how, and Murphy came in to kill, but met such a vicious
right that he suddenly developed considerable wariness
and several bruises and contusions. Then Sullivan’s tyre
blew out altogether, and his right weapon became unfit
for offence. Murphy whirled round, but Sullivan settled
down to a beautiful display of tactics. Ducking, back-
stepping, fading just out of reach, feinting with his use-
less hands, he bluffed and baffled Murphy for five amazing
rounds till time ran out, when it w r as declared a draw. It
was heroic, and this writer drinks Brother Sullivan’s
health.

Something between a blizzard and an earthquake
raged at Sydney National Sporting Club last week when
Maorilander Griffin and Albert Clarke raised dust and
wool. Both men worked frightfully hard, showering
blows and driving and forcing. It was the sort of scrap
that rouses onlookers to tremendous enthusiasm, but, all
the same, had either kept a little cooler, there were ample
opportunities to have ended it either way with one blow.
They stood toe to toe, and belted away blindly. That
isn’t boxing; but it was exciting to watch, and as the
people poured out of the hall they unanimously declared
it to be the most “ willing scrap ” ever fought at the
National, which was true. It was “ willing,” and nothing
else. By the sixth round Clarke was exhausted, and
really incapable of hitting a knock-out blow. Griffin was
still strong enough to hurt, and Clarke was having a bad
time of it, having been stretched once, and being
apparently incapable of defending himself. The referee
rightly stopped the butchery, and awarded the fight to
Charles Griffin.

Australian race clubs are, and have always
been, conspicuously “loyal.” When the first race club
was started under Macquarie and Lieutenant-Governor
O’Connell, most of the time was devoted, not to race
business, but to hooraying for the royal personages and
toasting their healths. The royal family of the day
consisted of a great number of persons, and the little
horsey group in Sydney insisted on drinking to each
individual separately. The result was that the leading
citizens of the infant State got into a fearful condition,
and saw three royal families at once.

HE AUSTRALIAN ORUL. CP II? SYDNEY
Significant little comment, from the Bund,
of Shanghai:—
No matter how diligently various subsidised papers
strive to create public goodwill towards the Japanese, it
seems their efforts are doomed to failure. The joyful
cry that went up the other night at Chang-su-ho when
Sandow’s Indian threw a giant Japanese wrestler amply
demonstrated the fact that, in all that vast audience, there
were but few who wished the Jap good-luck. Before the
war, everywhere the Japanese went his popularity
seemed assured. To-day he is regarded with suspicion
by all races, especially the Chinese, and with good cause.
The British army is quite a different
machine now from what it was formerly, for the
suicidal policy of the English aristocrats has
almost obliterated what was the spear head of the
Anglo-Saxon lance, i.e., the Celtic element. To
make room for deer and grouse they have driven
out the crofter from the Highlands, and, by mis-
government, the sort of men who used to compose
the Irish regiments. At present the British army
is 77.22 per cent. English; Irish, 12'5; Scotch,
8'62; the rest Welsh and sundries. No wonder
the War Office takes men as low as sft. high in
a land where the Government, which refused a
Royal Commission to inquire into the state of the
crofters, appointed one to inquire into a disease
amongst the grouse.
An essential step in Australian military
reform is the cancelment of the condition
that volunteers shall not be called on for service
outside their respective States. Every soldier
should be an Australian—not a Waler, or a Vic-
torian, or any other State man.
The Sydney morning papers provided a
humorous supplement to Bent’s Victorian Budget
speech. “Didn’t we tell you all along what a
fine thing Reform was ! ” they both squeaked.
Certainly. And look at the net results. Bent
got a real surplus, which allowed him, after carry-
ing out public works, to reduce the public debt,
funded and unfunded, by £282,888 (providing that
his figures stand audit). Carruthers produced an
alleged surplus of £141,843, and the sort of surplus
it was can best be sized up by the fact that, though
he collared about three times more land-sales
money than Bent did, he increased the public
debt, funded and unfunded, by £1,122,141. Reform
is a fine thing; but why don’t the Sydney daily
papers throw bricks at the N.S.W. bogus Re-
former who won’t do the fine thing ? If Bent’s
finance last year represented Reform, then Carru-
thers should be fired out for not being even a
colorable imitation of the article.

EXTRACT FROM “THE. LANCET.”
“This is an interesting material intended for ordinary underwear and made entirely, it is stated, from pure Irish linen yarn, a statement
which is confirmed by a microscopic examination which we have made. Linen is a well-known clean and healthy material, but its use as
underwear has been somewhat limited owing to the chilly feeling which is experienced when it is worn next to the skin. The Kneipp linen
underwear, however, is free from this disadvantage. It is a knitted elastic material which, while protecting the body from cold, freely allows
of the escape of perspiration. It is particularly well suited for summer wear, cool yet protective. Unlike woollen garments, it is not stained
by the perspiration from the axilla, a proof that the perspiration passes freely through the material.”
Our Warehouse (opposite the Princes Bridge Bailway Station) is conveniently situated, and accessible from
all parts of the city. A Penny Tram will bring Inter-State Visitors direct from the Wharf, and we shall consider
it a favor if Visitors will call and inspect our Stocks, whether desirous of purchasing or not.

will be sent to any address

At the opening of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition at the new Post Office, Hobart, on Wednesday, November 2,1904,
his Excellency the Governor (Sir Gerald Strickland, K.C.M.G.) made the following eulogistic reference to Beale’s Pianos :
“ I have been deeply interested in an Australian exhibit of pianos made on the other side of the straits, which are strung
on beautiful steel castings. I refer to Beale’s Pianos. I recently had the honor to serve his Majesty the King where no
piano could be kept in tune. Here an example is given how mechanical instinct can be perfected by trade ; that here
has been produced for a sub-tropical country pianos which will certainly stand the test of the worst heat in the tropics.
I sincerely trust it will, both here and there, meet with the success it deserves.” —Verbatim Press Report.

FIVE DROPS IN WATER
hatf-an-hour after meals is the
greatest Aid to Digestion known.
Mr. THOMAS FORSYTH, of Ashfield, writes, and declares on
oath, the following’:—
“ I suffered from acute inflammation of the stomach, with a
burning pain. My tongue got a thick coating ovep it, and I
constantly suffered from Nausea. Why, 1 used to be almost
constantly vomiting. I consulted two doctors in Ashfield for
years without getting relief. But in three weeks FISHER’S
PHOSPHERINE completely cured me. lam Noble Grand for
the Lo.yal Ashfield M.U.0.0.F. I have been in the Lodge for
18 years. Most of the members know of my illness. Five to
ten drops of FISHER’S PHOSPHERINE always takes away a
sour taste in the mouth, and keeps my stomach in regular
order. Let everyone know of my case.”
Subscribed and declared at Ashfield this Twentieth day of
August, one thousand nine hundred and three, before me—

WHAT IS CATARRH?
M
MEDICATOR.
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining- membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
ihe sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues, consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge, passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? If so, try
our great remedy.

‘ ‘ Hiphen : ” England is full of strange sur-
prises. Meandering along the City-road, London, I
came across “The Bunhill Fields Burial Grounds,”
where I found Daniel De Foe, John Bunyan and
several other notabilities are planted. It is one
of the most ancient cemeteries in England, and
the writing on the crumbling tombstones is almost
undecipherable. One epitaph runs :
Here lyes Dame Mary Page
Relict of Sir Gregory Page Bt.
She departed this life March 11th 1728
In the 56th year of her age.
In 67 months she was tap’d 66 times
Had taken away 240 gallons of water
Without ever repining at her case
Or ever fearing the operation.
At Lower Peover, in Cheshire, is a Norman church
with a famous old graveyard. Two lines of verse
on one grave dated 1626 are noteworthy. They
run if memory serves
If life were merchandise that golde could buy
The rich alone would live, the poor would die.
Which goes to prove that there was anti-Fat
feeling even in 1626. One long, fond and faded
epitaph refers to the virtues of one George Brown,
and ends “ He was a brave butcher.”
Pash etiquette seems to demand that the
deadlier a push is the more its name must suggest
shrinking innocence. At South Melbourne, the
other day, members of the White Rose push were
charged with such offences as breaking in a pub.
door, assaulting various persons with chairs,
attempted throttling, and threatening to bash an
old lady’s head with a stone. These playful out-
breaks are a mere matter of £3 or fourteen days at
South Melbourne. The magistrates there have
been educated up to this through dealing
with the Flying Angels—a gang of cherubim
and seraphim alleged at various times to use vigor-
ously such weapons of offence as hammers, fence-
pickets, and beer-bottles from which the beer has
been carefully extracted. A man charged, in a
Melbourne court, with using fearful language
usually turns out to be a member of the Blush
Rose push or the Languid Lilies. If a push starts
by labelling itself “the Footscray Fiends” or
“the Holy Terrors” one can depend that its
members are a lot of novices who have never
helped 14 others to kick an old age pensioner
because he wouldn’t “springa tray,” or throw a
ham at a barmaid when she refused to shout.
Last July, Chief Justice Stout of Maori-
land said things about the Privy Council, among
them being the remark that “he was surprise!
that people put up with their cases standing over
for two or three years before they were heard. . . .
As long as the State continued to have an
appellate tribunal situated thousands of miles
away, he did not know how they were going to
get on.” This moved the Lord Chancellor to
reply that, during the past two years, the longest
time taken up by a Maoriland case in the Privy
Council was nine months ; and he said m a deep
voice that he hoped Chief Justice Stout might
“correct the observation he made when he attri-
buted to the Privy Council the habit of delaying
eases for two or three years.” Blit Stout isn t
making any corrections. Instead, he goes into
figures, and shows that, during the past 15 years,
29 Maoriland appeals were decided by the Privy
Council. Three took (from date of final decision
of the M.L. Court to date of the Privy Council
decision) from nine months to one year ; 13 took
over one year and under two years; nine took
between two and three years ; two took between
three and four years; one took over five years;
and one took seven years. This is a pretty sudden
way to speak to a Lord Chancellor, and the
heavens may be expected to fall at any moment.

Touching the newspaper habit of administering taffy
all round in the theatrical “ criticisms,” a London weekly
remarks : “ The persistent glorification of trivialities and
small greatnesses destroys the glorifiers’sense of propor-
tion —if they ever had any. Whereby when anything
really praiseworthy comes along the injudicious glorifiers
are very much in the position of the cabman who, being
confronted by a real opportunity for blasphemous objur-
gation, said : ‘Guv’nor, I ain’t equal to it! ’”
HAVE YOU A
BAD LEG ?
With Wounds that discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen, that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated, the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease,
if alio wed to continue, will deprive you of the power to wa.k.
You may have attended various hospitals and had medical
advice and been told your case is hopeless, or advised to
subm tto amputation ; but do not, for I can cure you. I
don't say perhaps, but I will. Because others have failed
itisno reason I should. Send at once for a Box of Albert s

AGOOD General knows that
his brave fellows will have
little chance of winning the
battle if he neglects to provide
them with the best, the most
modern weapons. In the same
way the good housewife sooner or
later realises that, to overcome the
horde of maladies which contin-
ually menace the health of her
little band, she must provide them
with that perfect product of
modern healing science, Scott’s
Emulsion of cod liver oil with
glycerine and the liypophosphites
of lime and soda. Scott’s Emul-
sion is a remedy which has no
equal for combating coughs and
colds, lung, throat, skin and blood
troubles, wasting diseases, and
weakness! of any kind, whether in
adults or infants.

(Listen for a
moment to what
Mrs. George Ave-
ry wrote us on
this subject. Her
letter is dated
July 12th, 1904,
from Wide Street,
West Kempsey,
N.S.W. —
“My little
daughter, Edith,
aged four years,
recently caught
a severe cold,
which unfortun-
ately developed
into a bad attack
of bronchitis.
From the first
she took Scott’s
Emulsion readily
and soon began
to like it and look
for it. It eased
her cough and
breathing, redu-
ced all feverish-
ness, and in a
little while it ef-
fected a thorough
and complete
cure. She is now a
fine, healthy and
strong child.”
This power of making a general
assault upon disease is character-
istic of Scott’s Emulsion. The
reason is that
Scott's Emulsion
reinforces the vitality and thus
compels all disease or weakness of
whatsoever kind, to give ground
first, then to decamp altogether.

From Itching and Bleeding Eczema
Pain Terrible —Body and Face
Covered with Sores Doctors and
Medicines Failed.
ANOTHER WONDERFUL
CURE BY CUTICURA
u No tongue can tell how I suffered for
five years with itching and bleeding ec-
zema, until I was cured by the Cuticura
Remedies, and I am so grateful I want the
world to know, for what helped me will
help others. My body and face were cov-
ered with sores. One day it would seem
to be better, and then break out again
with the most terrible pain and itching. I
have been sick several times, but never
in my life did I experience such awful
suffering as with this eczema. I had
made up my mind that death was near at
hand, and I longed for that time when
I would be at rest. I had tried many dif-
ferent doctors and medicines without suc-
cess, and my mother brought me the
Cuticura Remedies, insisting that I try
them. I began to feel better after the
first bath with Cuticura Soap, and one
application of Cuticura Ointment. I con-
tinued with the Soap and Ointment, and
have taken four bottles of Cuticura Re-
solvent, and consider myself well. Any
person having any doubt about this won-
derful cure by the Cuticura Remedies
can write to my address. Mrs. Altie
Rtson, Bellevue, Mich.”
ITCHING ECZEMA
And All Other Itching and Scaly
Eruptions Cured by Cuticura.
The agonizing itching and burning of
the skin, as in eczema; the frightful
scaling, as in psoriasis; the loss of hair
and crusting of scalp, as in scalled head,
from infancy to age; all demand a
remedy of almost superhuman virtues
to successfully cope with them. That
Cuticura Soap, Ointment, and Pills are
such stands proven beyond all doubt.

Perth West Australian is painfully “ loyal.” Its
readers are informed that it is printed on machines
named King Edward VII. and Queen Alexandra, which
were both “started,” on their installation, by wives of
Governors. The names usually conferred on printing-
machines are too dreadful for publication. They are
mostly applied by a smudgy-faced toiler in oil-stained
blue dungarees, when the machine refuses to go satis-
factorily. The Bulletin would shudder to print the
“pet” names that those loyal machines will eventually
get.

From the Sydney Morning Herald : A police court in-
cident.—“ Mister Johnny O’Connor, a man of no honor,
went out with Miss Brady, a nice little lady, and treated
her to brandy, sponge cake, and candy, and more things
so dainty, as kisses in plenty. But at length the sad
fellow grew awfully mellow ; and as he was walking,
and kissing, and talking, with pretty Miss Brady,
the nice little lady, a purse full of ‘ rhino ’ (I wish
it were mine, oh!) he whipped from her pocket,
and cleared like a rocket. But soon he was taken,
while tracks he was making, and lodgings assigned him,
where justice may find him. But the maid on the morrow,
came forward in sorrow, her little heart heaving, and tears
her eyes leaving, and begged that his Honor would pity
poor Connor, to which he consented, as Connor repented
—when off went the couple, with limbs mighty supple ;
and left us presuming that maiden so blooming herself to
a life of much trouble was dooming. For Johnny, the
blockhead, who picked the maid’s pocket, when married,
I’m thinking, will whip her like winking.” But it was
from an issue 50 years old. The S.M.H. doesn’t try to be
funny now, though it sometimes succeeds better than
that.

In celebration of its jubilee, the Ballarat (Vic.) Star,
some little time ago, reprinted its first issue of September
22, 1855. Thatcher and Billy Barlow were then enter-
taining the diggers, and the one-time famous bruiser,
Alf. McLaren, was teaching them “healthful, invigorating
English sports.” The present editor of the Star, C. J.
Smith, is a son of James Smith, the veteran Victorian
journalist, and shudders in his comfortable quarters to
think of the time when a predecessor had to write his
leader lying prone on the office table, while flood waters
washed out the premises.

Christchurch (M.L.) papers are miserably under-staffed,
and the slaves on a great many country papers are far
better paid by comparison. The other day a reporter of
a Christchurch morning paper, which also produces an
evening issue and a weekly, resigned to go to a better
billet, and the inevitable presentation happened. The
staff of the morning paper bore testimony to his many
excellent qualities ; then the ditto of the evening reprint
followed; the boss of the weekly bringing up,the rear
with a “tiger.” The unfortunate reporter had been
working for all three. The Christchurch pressman who
helps pay dividends to two big companies (running three
papers apiece), requires to graft unceasingly from week-
end to week-end, and even when asleep is obliged to
keep one ear open for the firebell.

being plastered over with ugly commendations of Tinpot

There was Sheol to pay in an Australian newspaper
office recently when the first of a patent medicine series
of “ Heart-to-Heart Talks on Housemaid’s Knee, by
‘Old Girl,’” was made up in the next column to “Lady
Binks’s Reception, by ‘Old Girl.’” The medicine man
had, strangely enough, selected the same pseudonym as
the frocks-and-frills reporter. His contract stipulated for
a position adjoining the society gush, and in spite of the
original “Old Girl’s” hysterical threats of resignation
he refused to budge, and declared he would withdraw his
advts. if she changed her pen-name. So the poor pen-
pusher’s reports of the Women’s League and the
Chaperons’ Charity Band bear every appearance of being
written by a pill reporter. Great is the advertiser, and
will prevail.

The late John Robinson, editor of London Daily News,
used to tell of a penny-a-liner who traded off to a daily
paper an account of a harrowing event at Sutton, said
event having happened only in his own imagination.
His dupes attempted to give him in charge, but were met
by the production of a gazetteer showing that there were
more than 70 Suttons in England. As they could not
prove, without great expense, that the tragedy did not
take place at any of these villages, he was released, but
was afterwards sentenced to a term of imprisonment for
a less carefully-planned fraud.

Fifty years ago Melbourne Herald— then a morning
daily—was more outspoken than it is to-day. In its issue
of June Ist, ’55, it wrote about the people of England :
“ They get our gold by the ton weight, and they very
kindly send us in return for it a vast quantity of goods,
including the refuse of their warehouses and factories ;
but they display no eagerness to comply with our wishes
for a new Constitution, seeming to regard it as an imper-
tinence that we should trouble them on the subject.”
Same issue reports arrival in Hobson’s Bay of a vessel
with 46 Chows on board, making 1219 for that week. The
old “ representative” Council was even then debating a
Chinese Restriction Bill, and it is quite natural to learn
that the Chamber of Commerce of that day protested
against this legislation as “ contrary to the spirit of the
age, and opposed to the best interests of tfifrjaqlony.”
They call it “ Socialistic legislation” nowadaj&tafc it is
just the same old gag. .

Remarks on Men’s Diseases
And Operations by the Freeman &.
Wallace Staff of Physicians
and Surgeons.
There is no branch of medicine in which abso-
lute keenness of diagnosis and a thorough under-
standing of every detail of a case is so essential
as in the treatment of diseases of the Genito-
urinary Organs.
It is now over 25 years since the Specialists of
the Freeman & Wallace Institute initiated their
particular speciality—Diseases in Men —and in
that time they have operated in Australia alone
on over 8000 cases of Varicocele and Rupture.
Many other operations they enumerate, those for
Stone in the Bladder, with or without crushing ;
operations for Cancerous and other diseases of
the Organs ; removal of Stone in the Kidneys ;
Abscess with one or both Organs, removal of the
Nerve for persistent and incurable Neuralgia of
the Gland ; and many other difficult and dan-
gerous feats of Genito-Urinary Surgery.
Their treatment as regards Varicocele by Pain-
less, Non-cutting, Non-contracting and Bloodless
operation is generally approved of, and with that
end in view they have carefully collected and
tabulated statistics of operations of a large
number of operations of this nature.
They have been operating successfully for
Double and Single, simple and extremely compli-
cated cases of Varicocele, and can say with truth
they have seldom failed to cure a case however
bad or for how long a time it had existed.
They have operated on patients from the age
of six to the age of 84 years, in some cases where
the disease has existed for 40 years.
As a Medical Institute they challenge any Firm
in the world to show so large a number of cases,
or such an unbroken line of successes.
*•***•
Some Questions Asked.— For the benefit of
some patients who keep asking questions, the
Specialists wish to say that there is no cutting or
Blood Poisoning, and absolutely no pain.
The operation for Stricture or Varicocele never
injures the vital power: on the contrary, that
power is improved, wasting of parts stopped,
blood circulated through healthy channels, no
confinement in house or bed, and patient can
return home, even if distant one thousand miles,
on the following day. The result of the opera-
tion as performed by the Specialists is that the
moment the pressure of coagulated blood is
taken off the organs the small veins enlarge,
regain their circulatory power, and healthy cir-
culation is assured.
Hence new life, vigor, and strength in the
parts, after the operation for Varicocele, results.
Eight Frostatic & Bladder Facts
From Tabulated Records of
the Institute’s Staffs.
WHERE THE MEDICAL PROFESSION ERR.
1. —Eighty per cent, of all cases of Enlargement
of the Prostrate Gland are not due to
Fibrous Enlargement, but to Congestive
Swelling.
2. Every case of Congestive Enlargement is
curable if properly treated by Specialists
in the disease.
3. —Cutting operations on the Prostate are never
called for in Congestive Enlargement,
but are always dangerous in cic! men.
4. —ln Chronic Hypertrophy, Urinary and Bladder
Disorders, symptoms are unchanged. The
symptoms increase and decrease according
to causes.
5. In sixty.eight per cent, of all cases of Con-
gestive Enlargement, and of Chronic
Inflammation of the Bladder (Cystitis),
there exists a stricture of large calibre,
causing reflex irritation and continuous
trouble.
C. —A stricture of large calibre is one that causes
many bad reflex symptoms, and is one
that is professionally known as “ not
tight,” as shown in the small stricture.
7. —A patient with an enlarged Prostate or Stric-
ture of large calibre may medicate him-
self, but will never be cured.
8. —Nine doctors out of ten with little experience
class all enlargement of the Prostate
as Chronic Hypertrophy, and Incurable
without operation. Thousands of patients
who might have been cured have thus
been sacrificed.
* * • *
TERMB.— The Specialists’ terms for consultation
by mail or in person is FREE, and
confidential. This does not include an
examination by the Physician-in-Chief
with the Urethroscope, Endescope, or
Cystoscope (or Illumination of the Blad-
der) when necessary. After a thorough
examination, they know exactly what
the trouble is, and can tell exactly what
is necessary to effect a permanent and
lasting cure. The Specialists know the
diseases of men like a child knows its
alphabet or the pages of an open book.
PAINLEBS. —All examinations of any kind of a
minor degree are rendered bloodless,
painless, and free from complications by
the use of soothing medications known to
the Specialistic Staff.
Condensed Report of Operation
for Ulcer in Bladder.
Performed by Dr. R. WALLACE and his Staff
upon Mr. H. C. .
(Surname furnished privately, if necessary).
This patient was a terrible sufferer, experienc-
ing' all the inconveniences Inflammation of the
Bladder in its worst form would cause. Had been
to several doctors, receiving no relief.
Here is Dr. Wallace’s own extract: —
“I placed the patient on examination
table, noted following facts :
Bladder distended by urine, but no Stric-
ture. Prostate gland enlarged. Urine showed
Inflammation of Bladder and Congestion of
Kidneys, caused through stoppage, accom-
panied by agonising pain. Result of examin-
ation after searching for Stone with electric
Endescope. No stone and no gravel.
Bit up Urethral Canal, found it congested,
not diseased. Examined electrically after
washing out with clear salt solution. Every
fraction of the Mucus Membrane reflected in
mirror as plainly as if Bladder had been cut
open to the eye. Found on inner side of main
curve of Bladder Canal a small but deep ulcer.
This was the seat of trouble. Patient under
treatment seven weeks. Medicated applica-
tion to ulcer until it healed perfectly. Blad-
der and Prostate medicated. Later internal
remedies to regulate kidney action and
sterilise urine. Five years after received an
additional testimonial to one presented on
. patient’s recovery to health."
Extract from same
“Dear Dr. Wallace.—Enclosed you will
find my photograph. I think that is sufficient
testimony as to your skill and ability. lam
well and happy.
“ Yours faithfully,

Any man suffering from any form of disease of
the Urinary Organs should write personally to Dr.

THE FA.3VEOXJS REMEDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN THE WORLD.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs" have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a Complete Cure is certain.
IOJBJ'W.A.TT.IEI OF COUGHS !

Completely cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Sir,—Twelve years ago I had a severe attack of
Influenza and Bronchitis, and for ten years was suffering
with a terrible cough, and was wasting away. I had
medical attendance, and tried various medicines recom-

years. 1 tried every cough remedy I could get, but not
one of them seemed to do her any good. Then I tried
one bottle of your Bronchitis Cure, and she has never

ASTHMA 25 YEARS.
Immediately relieved by Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir.—l have been a martyr
to Asthma for about 25 years, and have tried almost all
known remedies for the complaint, and have been under
the treatment of leading Physicians throughout the
Australian States. I determined to try no more, but let
nature take its course. Two years ago I was asked to try
your Asthma Cure, but laughed at the idea. However,
by the persuasion of a very old friend, 3 weeks ago I
commenced the first bottle of your treatment. Almost
immediately I found that I had made a mistake by not
taking it before. lam now about half-way.through the
second bottle, and so much do I feel relieved that I take
this opportunity of sending this testimonial along for you
to make whatever use you may think fit. I intend
continuing your treatment, and I trust that before I have
finished the third bottle I shall be able to write to you
that lam perfectly cured. I am pleased to say the effect
has been wonderful.
Yours very gratefully, PHIL. HANN,
33 Camden St., Balaclava, Victoria.
BRONCHITIS.
A South Australian storekeeper testifies
to the Efficacy of Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure.
A sufferer 70 years old cured by it.
Well and hearty now.
Mr. W. G. Hearne. Dear Sir,—l am a storekeeper,
living in this township for the last 20 years. One of my
oldest customers has been subject to Bronchitis for a
number of years, and has been in the hospital with it
several times. Hearing of your valuable medicine, he
tried it, and found that it gave him great relief. One
bottle was sufficient to put him right. This gentleman
is over 70 years of age, an old bushman who has been in
these parts for the last 30 years, and is well known. He
makes my house his home when here, and got the medi-
cine from me. He is at my place now, and he says that
this winter is the freest he has had from Bronchitis for a
number of years, and he wishes to return you thanks for
your valuable Bronchitis Cure. He is well and hearty
now. You are quite at liberty to publish this or any part
of it you like, as it may be of great benefit to other people
suffering from Bronchitis.—Yours truly,
M. GOGLIN, Storekeeper,
Yunta, South Australia.
CONSUMPTION*
Too ill to leave his bed.
A complete cure.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.
Dear Sir, —I am writing- to tell you about the wonderful
cure your medicine has effected in my case. About three
years ago I began to cough. At first, the cough was not
severe, but it gradually got worse, and I became very
weak and troubled with night sweats, pain in my chest,
and great quantities of phlegm. On several occasions
there was blood in the expectorated matter. I had been
treated by a doctor, who pronounced my case to be con-
sumption, and various other treatments had been tried,
but without benefit. It was at this stage that I heard of
your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for a course of the
medicine. When it arrived, I was too ill to leave my bed,
but I commenced taking it at once, and gradually im-
proved. I am glad to say that the two lots of medicine
you sent have,effected a conjplete cure, for which accept
my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR,
Westminster-bridge Road, S.E., London.
Distressing, suffocating, dry cough for twelve
years.
Entirely removed by five doses of Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure.
No other treatment could even ease it.
Sir, —My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from most
distressing, suffocating, dry cough, that could not be re-
moved or even eased by any remedy, doctors’ prescrip-
tions and patent medicines having been tried ; but l am
happy to state that the cough, pain in the chest, and dif-
ficulty of breathing, etc., were entirely removed by the
fifth dose of your Bronchitis Cure.—i remain, sir, yours

In the Good Old Times.
By “Youth.’
Did the good old times, which we so often hear the praises of from our elderly relatives and
friends, ever really exist? Perhaps the judgment of these enthusiasts is obscured by the glamour
always lent by distance. Perhaps, too, their pulses are so quickened by recollections of their early
youth, when the world was new to them and all things seemed good, that they forget all but the
roseate streaks, and omit to remember the shadows.
To us, who read descriptions of the kind of life endured by people, not only in Australasia, but
in the old world, {fifty or seventy years ago, it seems incredible that anyone can call those times
“ good,” so void were they of comforts which we now look upon as necessities. Fancy, for instance,
getting rap on a cold morning and fumbling about with flint, steel and tinder before a fire could be
started. Why, the very thought makes one’s spine creep ! Of the use of steam people knew
but little, and electricity was merely a toy of the chemist. The useful applications of science,
which are now so common that we take them for granted, were unknown. Medical and surgical
treatment, instead of being, as now, reduced to sciences, were then largely empirical. Even at
the present day suteh complaints as rheumatism, gout, neuralgia, lumbago, sciatica, blood disorders,
anaemia, indigestion, biliousness, jaundice, sick headache, general debility, gravel, stone and bladder
troubles are occasionally treated as specific diseases instead of as disorders caused by the retention in the
system of uric acid and other urinary and biliary poisons which would have been duly removed from
the body by natural channels if the kidneys and liver had been acting actively and efficiently.
The kidneys of the average person filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine
every day. In this quantity of urine should be dissolved about an ounce of urea, ten or twelve grains
: in weight of uric acid, and other animal and mineral matter varying from a third of an ounce to nearly
an ounce. If the kidneys are working freely and healthily all this solid matter leaves the body
•dissolved in the mine, but if, through weakness or disease, the kidneys are unable to do their work
properly, a quantity of these urinary substances remains in the blood and flows through the veins,
contaminating (the" whole system. Then we suffer from some form of uric poisoning, such as
Rheumatism, Grout, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Persistent Headache, Neuralgia, Gravel, Stone,
and Bladder Troubles. A simple test to make as to whether the kidneys are healthy is to place some
urine, passed the first thing in the morning, in a covered glass, and let it stand until next morning.
If it is then cloudy, shows a sediment like brick-dust, is of an unnatural color, or has particles floating
about in it, the kidneys are weak or diseased, and steps must immediately be taken to restore their
vigor, or Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some of the many manifestations of uric poisoning will result.
The Liver is an automatic chemical laboratory. In the liver various substances are actually made
: from the blood. Two or three pounds of bile are thus made by the liver every day. The liver takes
. sugar from the bfeod, converts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able to again supply it
to the blood as tli* latter may require enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is insoluble,
into urea, which is completely soluble, and the liver also deals with the blood corpuscles which have
lived their life and are useful no longer. When the liver is inactive or diseased we suffer from some
form of biliary poisoning, such as Indigestion, Biliousness, Anaemia, Jaundice, Sick Headache, General
Debility, and Blood Disorders.
So intimate is the relation between the work done by the kidneys and that done by the liver, that
where there is any failure on the part of the kidneys the liver becomes affected in sympathy and vice
versa. It was the realisation of the importance of this close union of the labor of these vital organs
which resulted in the djse(overy of the medicine now known throughout the world as Warner’s Safe
' Cure. Certain medical men, knowing what a boon it would be to humanity if some medicine could be
found which would act staeicifically on both the kidneys and liver, devoted themselves to an exhaustive
search for such a medium, and tiheir devotion was eventually rewarded by their success in com-
pounding a medicine whivh polssessles the required quality in the fullest degree. Warner’s Safe Cure
exhibits a marvellous heaflinjg fiction in all cases of functional or chronic disease of the kidneys and
liver, and restoring them, Las inis able to do, to health and activity, it of necessity cures all complaints
•due to the retention in thevysiteim of urinary and biliary poisons. A vigorous action of the kidneys
; and liver naturally eliminates j the poisons, and troubles due to the presence of the poisons cease,
' Cures effected by Warner’s £ • ftfo Cure are permanent, simply because they are natural. [II
Back from the Brink.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
were three ; sitting in a Sydney
cafe, with drinks before them upon a little
marble-topped table.
Legarde’s outward personality dominated.
Thirty or so; tall, well-built and well-featured,
with hard blue eyes and a tawny “torpedo”
beard, trimmed to a miracle.
“I am surprised, Frankland,” he was saying,
“ to find such a delightful ingenuousness remain-
ing to a man of your years. What’s the figure,
eh ? Forty, or thereabout ? ”
Frankland took his cigar from his mouth.
“Forty-two next month,” he said, with a crisp
projection of the words that contrasted notably
with the other man’s carefully-regulated accents.
An undistinguished-looking man, Frankland ;
shortish and square, with a face plain, but plea-
sant and thoughtful. He, too, wore a “ torpedo,”
but it was grizzly-black and roughly-trimmed,
and in his air and manner there was a skipper-
ashore suggestion that was further favored by his
carelessly-worn blue serge. But his ship was a
wool-warehouse, and he was only joint-captain
thereof.
He took a sip, half-a-dozen cigar-puffs, and
laughed laconically. “Just so!” he said.
“Some men won’t believe any evil of women.
They are fools ! Others, like you, Legarde, won’t
believe any good of ’em. They are ” ——
“Go on.” Legarde complacently stroked his
beard. “ Don’t boggle at the word. ‘Scoundrels'
you would say, eh ? ”
“ I shouldn’t be afraid to say it, if I thought it,”
Frankland answered solidly. “But, upon con-
sideration, I think that men who believe as you do l
are also merely fools in the opposite direction.
The stock-question in these cases I won’t ask.”
“Oh, I know!” Legarde smiled sourly,
“ Haven’t I a mother —isn’t that it? Or sisters?'
No sisters ; and my mother died at my birth.”
Frankland emptied Ms glass and got up.
“ Well, there you are ! ” he said, waving his cigar
conclusively. “ You’re more to be pitied than
blamed for your opinion, after all. You’ve
hitherto regarded woman only from the—what
shall I call it ? —the predatory male point of view.
You’ve never seen the domestic side of her ; the
sacred side ; the—the most real side of her, if I
may so put it. Eh, Tubby, what? do- yyy, say
about it ? ”
Old-young-man Prodge was a “ rising solicitor,’*
known to his intimates as “ Tubby,” for no better
reason than that his front name was Theobald.
He had a small, spare, severely buftoned-up
figure, surmounted by a round, red, hairless face
that might have belonged to 16 or to six-and-
thirtv. He was, in fact, 27, but had already with
confidence labelled himself a very wary old bird.
He took his pipe from his mouth, and spasmodi-
cally spoke, blinking oddly the while with little=
spiky black eyes.
“ Sheer waste of time endeavoring t’ understand!
women. Used to try, myself, when I was young'
and green. Pretty soon found out, though, why
I couldn’t—why no fella could. Simply nothing ini
’em to understand. Ho, ho! Problem of the
Ages solved. R’dic’lously simple, after all. ”
Frankland looked quizzically down upon
Prodge. “What a foolish little fungus it is!.’”
he said. “And it seriously takes itself for am
oracle. But, about you, Legarde. The cure for
your false estimate of women is marriage. A
good wife would soon clear that cloud from your
perceptive atmosphere.”
“ A good wife ! ” Legarde leant back in his
chair and gazed at the ceiling with half-closed
eyes. “ That’s just the point—are there any good
wives? Can any man vouch for another mam’s
wife ? Bah ! Can any man even answer for Ms
own?”
Frankland had turned to go, but at this he
faced quickly round. “Look here, Legarde,” he
sharply began—then checked himself and said
with simple directness: “Yes, I would answer
for mine. I would stake my soul upon her,” he
added, with sudden and uncharacteristic intensity.
Legarde slowly transferred his gaze from the
ceiling to Frankland’s face. “Well,” he said,
“itis a truly charming confidence. Let us hope
it will never receive a shock.”
“ I don’t half like your tone, Legarde,” Frank-
land said, answering the other man’s eye
rather than his speech. “ But, as you are nothing
if not cynical, I’ll let it go at that—especially as
you are yourself acquainted with Mrs. Frank-
land.”
“I have that honor,” Legarde answered.
“And if anything I have said ”
“No, no; that’s all right,” put in the easily-
mollified Frankland. “As I’ve just said, you’re
a bit too fond of airing your cynicism. And now
I’m off. Good-day. ’Day, Tubby,” and Frank-
land walked out.
The other two smoked in silence for a space.
Then Prodge put down his pipe, thrust his hands
deep into his trouser-pockets, and fired off a series
of short sharp chuckles.
Legarde eyed him keenly. “Find anything
specially amusing in the recent conversation, Mr.
Prodge ? ”
“Yes,” Tubby answered promptly—“dev’lish
amusin’. Frankland stakin’ his soul upon his
wife, and you with your ‘ honor of her acquaint-
ance.’ Oh, my lamented aunt! it’s howlin’
funny ! ”
Legarde moved his chair close to Prodge’s,
depressed his brows, steeled his eyes, and spoke
in sternly-slow staccato. It was a method which
had served him well with men more apparently
forceful than little Tubby Prodge.
“Now, what you’ve got to do, right here and
now, my enigmatical friend, is to explain exactly
what you’ve been hinting at.”
Prodge struck a match, produced an immense
cloud of vapor from his re-lighted pipe, and simply
chuckled again.
“You hear me?” Legarde took a further reef
in his brows—put an extra edge upon his voice ;
but Tubby surveyed him with cheerful imper-
turbability. “Oh, yes; I hear you all right.
Fire away, ’s long’s you like ! ”
Legarde understood that here was a hand that
was not to be forced, and took another line. He
moved his chair away, rang the table-bell for
drinks, lit a cigar, and puffed indifferently for a
minute or so.
“Well, Tubby,” he said then, “all Sydney
knows that you are a mighty hard case. Still, as
a friend, you know, you must see that you have
said too much—and yet too little.”
Prodge crossed his legs indifferently. “ Oh,
well,” he said, “it’s goin’- to stand at that. It
can’t be any less, now ; and it isn’t goin’ to be any
more—’cept that I’ll lay you a hundred to fifty it
doesn’t conic off 1 Are you on ? ”
The other looked him steadily in the face.
“You are pleased to be facetious. I haven’t the
remotest idea of what you mean.”
“Oh, all right,” said Tubby. “Two and two
make five, it seems ! ” With which oracular utter-
ance, Mr, Prodge stood-up, absorbed his wliisky-
and-soda, pocketed his pipe, nodded, and walked
out. .
“ He’s a cunning little devil,” Legarde said to
himself; “and he’s evidently heard something.
Well, if there are whisperings abroad” —he got
suddenly up—“ there’s no time to lose.”
* * * *
She was a tall, blonde woman, with more of
Juno about her than of Venus, and with a shapely
and serious-looking upper face that contradicted -
or balanced—the somewhat sensuous curves of lip
and chin. An unwonted flush tided now over
neck and cheek as she listened to Legarde’s low,
insinuating tones.
It must be now or never, he told her. Rumors
were evidently abroad ; rumors that in a week or
two —perhaps in a few days —must reach her hus-
band’s ears. “ What a duffer Frankland is, by
the way!” Legarde broke off. “His notions
about some things—about your charming sex, for
instance —are so absurdly rococo and blue-mouldy.”
Mrs. Frankland frowned. Out of tune as she
believed she was with her husband—unsesthetic,
unornamental, undemonstrative—she thought she
had found in Legarde the spiritual accord for
which her soul craved. But here was a note that
jarred. Her husband, she knew, was not a duffer.
“ Indeed,” she asked herself now, “ must not this
man be himself somewhat of a fool to have
formed such an estimate of John Frankland ?”
“ Good old John ! ” she answered, quietly. “He
certainly lacks many of the qualities you possess,
Mr. Legarde; but why do you call him a duffer?”
Legarde smiled superciliously, as he told
himself that a man must be in hopeless ease
with his wife when she could speak of him as if
she were saying of a dog, “ Good old Towser!.”'
“Oh, well, you know,” he said; “it’s ai bit
■embarrassing to put the thing in plain words.
But Frankland good, easy man has such
blind and absolute confidence in you that ”
“ Go on ! ”
The woman’s tone was not encouraging; and
Legarde, falling somewhat short of his ordinary
self-assurance, became a little brutal.
“Oh, well; it was this way. Frankland and I
got talking about women ; and, when I said that
no wife was to be trusted, your husband said that
he, at all events, trusted you—‘would stake his
soul upon you,’ he rather ridiculously added. A
truly absurd combination —school-miss sentiment
and stodgy John Frankland ! ”
But Mrs. Frankland did not echo Legarde’s
contemptuous laugh—did not, indeed, seem to
have heard it.
“He would stake his soul upon me,” she re-
peated, softly and slowly. “He said that, did
he —‘ stodgy John Frankland ?’ And J”
She stopped abruptly; and Legarde, astonished,
saw that her eyes were moist. But he did not
yet realise the developing situation, and his next
words determined it.
“Don’t you think, Milly, that this is a bit gro-
tesque—that it’s rather late in the day for you
to be trying to get Frankland into a romantic
focus ? You and I, now ”
Mrs. Frankland came suddenly and stood over
him where he sat.
“You and I,” she echoed, “have done with
each other from this moment ! ”
“ What?”
“ Done with each other, I say—absolutely and
for ever ! ”
He took his hand from his beard, and smiled
indulgently.
“Madness, Milly,” he said ; “sheer madness !”
“No. On the contrary, it is sanity—recovered!
sanity. I see now where I stand —see that, had I
—fled with you, as you desired, I should have
been exchanging a plain man who, like a man,
nobly and unreservedly trusts me—for what ? For
the elaborate and ornamental Mr. Charles Arun-
del Legarde—a man who, by his own showing,
places no particle of trust in any woman.”
Legarde twiddled a ring upon his finger while
he looked at the woman in silence for half-a-
minute or so.
“Oh, well,” he said; “your behaviour in
this matter, Mil—er —Mrs. Frankland, is hardily
likely to modify my opinion in that respect. Amelia
of course,” he added, with cold vindictiveness, “I
need hardly say that, if you had —honored me by
sharing my fortunes —-I should have been qui te
prepared—supposing you retained youir—ev—
reasonably good looks—to discover someday that
you had cast in your lot with somebody else;
younger ; possibly richer; and —even more of a
■dupe.”
Mrs. Frankland, in perfectly restored calm,
faced him squarely.
“Dupe you are not, Mr. Legarde,” she said.
“And villain I suppose I have hardly the right-
to call you ; since I thought—or thought I thought-
—of deserting, for you, the man whose absolute:
trust in me it is not yet too late to- justify ! ”
The light in the woman’s eye and the ring ini
her voice were new to Legarde; but he listened!
with a coldly sceptical smile.
“ Rather well done, I must admit,” he answered!
with indolent insolence. “I fancy you’d have
been fairly effective on the stage, Mrs. Frankland..
In the cruder and more vulgar sort of melodrama,,
of course, I mean. But, as I have no taste for any
but the highest class of dramatic work, you will!
allow me to —er—take my leave.”
He thought he had rather neatly covered his re’-
treat; but, as he walked away from the house, he:
told himself that he would have to revise hiss
Theory of the Sex. “First, I thought I had: got,
that woman by the head; then by the heart.
Now I know I was never within a thousand miles
of either.”
“Hullo, Legarde; coming from my place?” 1
Frankland and Prodge had just got off the tram.
“ Better turn back and dine with us, hadn’t you ?'
I’m bringing Tubby to sample a new brand of:
cigar I’ve got, so you’d better come along, too.”
Frankland’s proffered hand Legarde would not-
see. “Sorry,” he answered coldly, “but I can’t
possibly. Leaving Sydney to-morrow.” He
nodded curtly and passed on.
Frankland stared after him. “ Now, that’s-
what I call queer. He’s a bitter pill enough, ~
Legarde, at times, but I never before knew him
to do a deliberately rude thing. What in creation,
are you choking about now, Tubby? You’ll
chuckle off that valuable head of yours one of.'
these days if you’re not careful.”
“ He’d have lost! Safe as houses, he’d have:
dropped that fifty ! ” Prodge jerked out in frag-
ments. “ Legarde, I mean. After you left us in
Gargaroni’s, t’other day, I offered to lay him a
hundred to fifty that a certain event wouldn’t
come off. Wouldn’t take me. Fifty in my pocket
if he had.”
“I see. But, how is it that you have now so
suddenly discovered that he’d have lost ? Or
rather, may one inquire, in the first place, what
was the subject of the wager?”
“Oh, yes.” Prodge carefully ignored the first
question. “ One may inquire, certainly ; but one
can’t be informed. Secret, m’ dear sir—strict
pr’feslinal secret! ”
Frankland remained vaguely puzzled; and,
later on, at dinner, he said suddenly to his wife,
“So you had Legarde here this afternoon, Milly.
We met him as we came from the tram, and he'
was positively surly. Actually refused my hand,
confound him ! And Tubby, here, appears to
know why; but he says the matter is a profes-
sional secret.”
Mrs. Frankland’s breathing quickened, and her
face flushed and then paled, but it was a calmly
inquiring eye she turned upon Prodge. Tubby
fidgeted under her gaze ; and, though his red face
couldn’t get any redder, the woman in a flash
understood that Legarde’s attentions to her had
been talked about. But she spoke with apparent
indifference.
“ Professional secrets are very strictly preserved
by you gentlemen of the law, are they not, Mr.
Prodge ?”
The astute Prodge understood between the
words. The woman was appealing to him to keep
to himself anything he might have heard, and he
gave—by implication—the required assurance.
“ Certainly, Mrs. Frankland—certainly ! ” he
hastened to say. “Close as oysters! Silent as
th’ grave ! —’n’ all that sort ’f thing. Oh, yes;
we’re—l’m—to be depended upon, to the —um—
the last gasp ! ”
Mrs. Frankland inwardly anathematised the
man’s apparently uncalled-for impressiveness;
but her husband only laughed.
“ Keeping dark is all the religion Tubby’s got,”
he said. “ And a good thing too. If you lawyer-
chaps were to let out some of the things that come
to your knowledge, there’d be a rare burst-up in
many a ‘ proper ’ household. Wouldn’t there,
Milly?”
Mrs. Frankland’s self-command gave way at
last. She rose hurriedly. “Really, John, how
should I know ? And—excuse me—l find I have
forgotten something that must be attended to at
once.”
When his wife had left the room, Frankland
leaned complacently back in his chair.
“Thinks all wives are as good as herself,” he
said. “ Let’s drink her health.”
Never before in Prodge’s experience had arisen
an occasion calling so urgently for his sardonic
chuckle. But with a mighty effort he refrained.
He only nodded gravely and emptied his glass.
ALEX. MONTGOMERY.
Melb. Argus and other southerners who
protest against giving Queensland a little help to
put its sugar industry more firmly on its feet
ought to feel mean when they read some official
figures just produced showing the effect of the
Federal uniform tariff on trade and manufacture.
In 1899, the year before Federation, Queensland
paid £91,533 to the other States for Australian-
manufactured goods; in 1904, it paid £616,298.
The southern States only supplied the north
with £929 worth of boots and shoes in 1899 ; last
year, £106,060 worth —the latter being almost
exactly the amount by which the value of Queens-
land’s own output declined. States that have got
that much benefit out of the Federal bargain, and
then begrudge the northern State the white-
grown sugar bonus, deserve a lot of contempt.


INDIGESTION
Five Years a Sufferer.
Xb'A
n
m
INDIGESTION comprises many ail-
ments, has many varied symptoms.
Pain after food relieved slightly
when wind is rifted ; a feeling of
sickness if awakened suddenly; headache ;
a bad taste in the mouth; the recurrence
of food; heartburn; sleeplessness; —all
these, or any of them, may be .present.
They all mean that the digestive organs are
out of order, and need a little help to get
them equal to their work. Bile Beans give
that help and tone up the digestive organs,
so that they can do their work properly.
“For about five years,” says Miss Jessie
Hay, of Montefiore-street, Wellington,
N.S.W., “ I suffered intense agony from
Indigestion and Flatulency. I consulted
several doctors, who prescribed for me, but
without beneficial results. Many adver-
tised so-called remedies were also tried, but
still I suffered on, and life became a per-
feet burden to me. A friend, who had proved the worth of Bile Beans, advised me to
undergo a course, and as a further inducement presented me with a box. By the time I
had finished that box, I noticed a considerable improvement in my health, and, thus
encouraged, I underwent a thorough course. By the time I had finished the ninth box, I
was completely and thoroughly cured of Indigestion and Flatulency, which result is
entirely due to Bile Beans. I never fail to recommend them to fellow-sufferers.”
BILE BEANS are a SAFE FAMILY MEDICINE and a PROVED CTTRE for
BILIOUSNESS, HEADACHE, INDIGESTION, CONSTIPATION, PILES,
DEBILITY, FEMALE WEAKNESSES, NERVOUSNESS, BAD BLOOD,
BAD BREATH, ANHiMIA, DISTURBED SLEEP, LOSS OF APPETITE,
PIMPLES, and ALL SKIN ERUPTIONS, SPRING AILMENTS, and,
ar
in fact, all ailments that owe
their origin to a disordered liver,
assimilation or digestion. BILE
BEANS are obtainable generally at

GORDON & GOTCH,
The Land of Ifs and ’Isms.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE’S a country that I wot of that is
ologgec with creeds and schisms;
Which is bogged with piebald parties and
with fragments of reform ;
I have labelled it in sorrow as the Land of Ifs and
’lsms,
And it drifts around the compass like an ark
before a storm !
It is full of navigators, but the crew are all com-
manders—
-And the captain takes his orders from the man
before the mast;
-Half the hands lean o’er the taffrail and salute the
wind with slanders,
And the others wave “ objectives ” as a kind of
counterblast!
’Mid the shrieking and the shouting all neglect
the precious rudder,
So she drifts away to starboard till she slaps
around to port;
And the idle sails are flapping with a melancholy
shudder,
And the passengers are quaking while the crazy
fools cavort !
There is a harbor waiting, but it’s doubtful if
she’ll get there,
For they’ve flung the sextant over as a bait for
passing sharks;
Lo ! the hold admits the ocean—there’s a mon-
strous mass of wet there —
And the man who talks of baling is assailed with
blue remarks.
All the bulkheads groan and grumble, for she’s
water-logged and weary—
Yea, she’s sick of navigators who forget to navi-
gate;
And the trade-wind blows like thunder, but the
crew are blind and bleary—
Aye, there’s no one in the chart-room of the
battered ship of State !
"There’s a blather in the fo’c’sle, but a gross of
cataclysms
.Are revolving round the hooker while they argue
black is white;
Whilst they squabble and they palter o’er their
useless Ifs and ’lsms,
JLo ! the old s.s. Australia slides and staggers
through the night.
JLoud the ocean slams against her, and it bangs
her back and forwards
While the frantic skipper prances like a puppet
on the poop;
•’She is stumbling through the moisture east and
west and south and nor’wards—
She is drinking in the dampness like a mayor
who’s dredging soup.
All the winds are waltzing round her with their
talons linked together—
All the storms that ever rattled beat against her
helpless lee.
Why the crew keeps on discussing, in the midst
of hell’s own weather,
Is the part that’s flabbergasted and entirely
jiggered me !
lor they yowl and kick and scramble in insane
antagonisms—
Eor they bleat and bawl and bluster while the
planks start underneath ;
Either they must wrap a scabbard round their
blatant Ifs and ’lsms.
<Or the sea will suck thtm under in a universal
sheath !
Is the crew likewise commander—is the captain
boss or servant —
Will the parties in the fo’c’sle cease their blather
and explain ?
I am heaving out the question in a manner harshly
fervent—
Who is going to steer Australia o’er the wild
industrial main ?
Is the sextant good for shark-bait, since it dangles
o’er the quarter ?
Does it aid Australia’s progress to reel on with
flapping sails ?
Lo, financial waves loom skyward, then fall
sullenly athwart her—
Say, does that assist Australia through the fierce,
ship-smashing gales ?
Post an A.B. at the tiller—steer for Port
Industrialism—
Or the ship of State will founder sure as ships go
down at sea;
Clear away the useless hamper—jettison each If
and ’lsm
Or she’ll rot beneath the ocean for a moist
Eternity!

GRANT HERVEY.
Chaotic Gippsland.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
\T AY out in Gippsland, back on the
\ * Brandy Creek road, soft-rutted with red
mud a foot deep, between high banks of
scrub, towered over by the skeletons of giant trees
—these monsters that men, women and children
must give life and hope to vanquish.
There is a desolation hard to describe, peculiar
to a ring-barked wintry forest—the wet, bulky
patches of flowerless scrub, the green shoots grow-
ing up through the dead sticks of last year’s burn-
ing. Everything tells of the necessary and yearly
bush fire—dead tree-ferns, the first irresistible
growth of curled pink fronds from the ground-fern
roots, blackened logs and stumps and falling fence,
posts.
Whistling through the maimed and naked spars
• comes the searing chill of the east wind —that
awful winter wind that sweeps about the rounded
Gippsland hills, that makes the heart of him that
toils in the rain wax bitter, and makes the women
and youngsters—wet-footed, wet-skirted in the
•cowyard—curse their fate. Here Fate and Cow
turn man loose to fatten or starve, as luck and his
o .vn exertions will have it, on these hillside selec-
tions, hampered by bad roads, want of stock and
tools and implements, by want of human sym-
pathy and communion, by fire and fern and
thistle fern and thistle so rapid in growth that
towards the end of the season they prick the
horseman’s face as he rides among them, ruining
the crop that has been saved from the ravages of
the pests that haunt the forest clearing.
All the way through, for one roomy weathei *
proof homestead, surrounded by its breakwind of
pines, with cobbled yards and stout out-buildings
of slab and bark, with hayrick and ensilage-pit,
with good draught horses and profitable cows,
there will be a hundred families insufficiently
fed, with poor, ill-nourished cows rushed to the
slough of despond called the yard, indolently
milked and thrust aside. What interest is there
in the milking when every drop must go to the
Factory, dragged there with great difficulty on
the rough, slipping sled, through miles of melting
red earth, by the stumbling grass-fed horse, half
numb with cold, stupid with emptiness !
All through the wretched years these men
have realised that in some way too secret, too
clever for their wkrped imaginations to cope with
and discover, they have been defrauded—systema-
tically cheated. No matter what may be the real
quality of the cream, the butter is always reported
a s “2nd class,” the milk is always “poor,” and
those few shillings that would make all the differ-
ence between comfort and discomfort are never
forthcoming.
There is little milk or butter used in the average
household. Everyone unquestioningly sacrifices
his share to the general advantage. It must all
“ go to the creamery ” in the hope that some day
the cheque will be up to their expectations.
Meanwhile it is treacle on the home-made bread-
th is same home-made bread that is so sweet and
wholesome in theory, so uncertain in fact. Where
one batch is good, half-a-dozen are bad, a dozen
indifferent, and, whether good, bad, or indifferent,
what is made must be eaten. Fortunately, per-
haps, keen air, hard work, and short commons
give one an excellent appetite and digestion.
Beautiful Gippsland ! Tramping and camping
in its wonderful recesses, alive to the melodv of
bird and rare brown stream, aware of the splendid
presence of its everlasting hills, regretting the
downfall of its mighty timber, watching the
inroad of its swarming settlers, heart and hope
and youth pouring out their treasures on its rich,
cold soil, spending all, realising perhaps, by slow
and aching degrees, the awful waste of effort,
leaving the fruit of their labors to be gathered by
other hands, and making, with shattered energy
and fortune, for the risky North, where, they
argue, even a seven years’ drought is as nothing
in the fullness of one glorious harvest. O, for
brown, sunlit plains, after these interminable
green hills ! 0, for dry, exhilarating air, after
this perpetual rain ; for rest from this overwhelm-
ing vegetation ! So with infinite difficulty some
go, and the men who take their places come gladly
from the drought and dust, the flies, and sheep of
the West, to break their hearts, and half-starve
in their ignorance and inexperience, by those old
chimney corners where other brave hearts broke
before. And so the change goes on, always
changing until the right man comes—the man
whose place in the world it is. The others, the
ghosts, the men with bleeding hearts and weary
bodies, the women with the eyes of pain
and hard, drawn lips, they are the makers
of the places of other men. I have a
hope that all may drift ultimately to some
appointed place, wherein, as they have sown for
another's reaping, so shall they reap of another’s
sowing—but let it be here upon earth.
I know a district near the Macdonald Ranges
(they gleam blue between tall trees south-east).
The land is half-cleared (improved they call it ;
Nature forgive them). The biggest of the timber
is dead, but the logs and brushwood encumber
the ground in one impenetrable thicket, and every
storm brings down tons of rotten limbs. This
lumber the hardy Gippslander speaks lightly of as
“rubbish” —a most insignificant expression con-
sidering the time and labor involved in “ cleaning
it up.” These great stretches of ring-barked but
otherwise “unimproved” land are interspersed
with the home paddocks under cultivation, where
really fine crops are grown, but what is the use of
the finest crop if the farmer gets a bill instead of
a cheque when he has finally delivered it to the
commercial swindler in Melbourne ?
I his district is, I think, unique in that every
farm in it has changed hands at least twice, and
in some cases three or four times, in five years.
Yet prices ruling are fairly high. Farmers coming
from utterly different country feel rested and en-
couraged by the freshness and green growth, judg-
ing of possible root crops by the circumference of
the trees, perhaps. One midsummer I went by
train from Parwan (near Bacchus Marsh) to
Warragul. and from there about twenty miles out
towards the Baw Baws in a buggy. I saw it then
as they see it—it was Fairyland. It was more—it
was real, it was purchasable. I could always
understand after that how it was that clever men
lost their heads (and money, forbye) in these
black wood gullies and fern-clasped hills — they
who came from parching downs, pale-grassed and
treeless.
It is winter now, and the whole thing is soaked.
Even a bushfire, with a hot north wind to hustle
it along, would hardly warm the rain that drips
so drearily. Grey and green can make a very
dispiriting combination—grey trees barely distin-
guishable against grey skies, dull green bush and
sodden native grass a-tangle, grey unpainted
wooden houses, grey picket fences—grey, grey
and green and gaunt. Grey, gaunt men and
women ; long, lean boys and girls rosy in spite of
fate. There is the dripping of water through
ferns, and the clink-clang of bell birds. There is
melancholy and depression of spirit in the heart
of the great Bush even when skies are deep
Australian blue, when golden shafts of sunlight
patch the boles of living trees, when starry strands
of blossom feed the humming insects. But go
there now in this cheerless winter season, and
every heartbeat is a pain, for the beauty that can
make pain endurable is gone, and nothing
remains but the reluctantly dying forest over-
spread by the brooding wings of devastation and
destruction. Well, after all, it is but the Begin-
ning, and the beginning of all things is Chaos.
ROKE.

teresting letter from Mr. James Sumers, who also

“Indigestion and liver complaint
troubled me greatly, and the money I
spent on various medicines was only
wasted, as they did me no good. A
friend asked me why I did not take
AYER’S
Sarsaparilla
I thought that if I did the result would
be the same as with the other medi-
cines; but, to my great surprise, after
taking a few doses I felt really better,
and I continued until I had taken, in all,
seven or eight bottles. I was then able
to digest my food, and it made me feel like a new man. I now always
have with me a supply of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.” James Sumers, North
Terrace, Adelaide, S. A.
Of course you cannot enjoy good health if your stomach gives out.
You must have an appetite, must digest your food, and must keep
your liver active. Muscular strength, nervous strength, desire to be
active, and a feeling of general good health may be yours by keeping
your liver active and your blood pure. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla strengthens
the stomach and aids digestion.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla will do all this for you, but
you must insist upon getting “AYER’S,” for it is
stronger, contains more valuable ingredients, and
cures more quickly than any other kind.

THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS of
Sept. 28, 1895, says :
“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”

WILFLEY v. CARD CONCENTRATOR.
The iudgment in the recent law suit does not apply to the original Card Concentrator, but only to two experimental
Table Tops that were made for the purpose of trial during the absence of Mr. Guthridge from Australia, and before
the working of the Table was properly understood. We are, therefore, continuing the manufacture and sale of these
machines, and the mining industry will not be deprived of this valuable invention. According to the sworn evidence,
the “ Card” has 50 per cent. “ greater capacity and makes higher concentrates and poorer tailings than the 4 Wilfley.’
With the ‘ Card 7 there is practically no loss of lead (mineral), as there is with the ‘ Willley.’ ”
The “ Card ” Table may be seen on application, when evidence of its grea ( t superiority will be furnished.
