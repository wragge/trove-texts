A Remnant Sale
A few mouths ago I signed a contract
with The Bulletin. The essence of it
was that, for the first time in tmr loose
literary relationship, extending over 40
years, I should endeavor to create a certain
amount of original literature. I took
down dusty files marked “Literary (to com-
plete),” God knows for how long I had
been slipping scraps of paper on to those
files. lam still looking at their contents,
scattered over the camp, and wondering if
this so-called Race of Life may not be all
starters and no finish.
Two of these files contain rhythmic false
starts, punctured inspirations, poetic mis-
carnages; in other words, unfinished poems,
lhe joke of the matter is that, pucker my
forehead as I may, I’m damned if I can give
one of these poetic lmmunculi either a com-
plete body or a perfect soul! So I propose
a remnant sale.
Ladies, gentlemen and literary critics, I
will take the goods as they come to hand.
h irst article, “Ada Clancy of Swan Hill.”
written in green ink. The title crossed out
and these verses following:—
When God took up his trowel
And wond’rously began
To make this gladsome planet
A dwelling-place for man,
He patted down the deserts
And ridged our mountain chains;
He scooped our pleasant valleys
To catch the seaward rains.
He flattened down the hilltops ;
And, just a moment, stood
Out there upon Monaro
And saw His work was g00d....
At this juncture I must have either fallen
away from grace or the Creator failed me,
tor the story ends there.
Second article, rather old and shopworn ;
must have been the parent of many com-
pleted love poems. Title: “I Loved You.”
Yes I loved you, that is all.
The days will come, the davs will fall •
And I loved you, that is all."
Ah, no more, no more, no more,
Though the Spring will yield her store—
Ah, no more, no more, no more.
When the summer, red and young,
Sings the song the world has sung,
When the world was green and young;
When the autumn, brown and grey,
Comes to bide the leaves away,
We shall walk the lovers’ way
Ah, no more!
This might pass as a sentimental “frag-
ment m a volume.
The next remnant is written boldly on
pmk copy-paper:—
“Go forth and sound thy trumpet!”
The Lord of Judgment said.
The tired Earth groaned and shivered,
. The deeper .depths were stirred
This Apocalypse goes no further. It is
y -n lc tuning-up of Gabriel’s instrument,
ft will never be anything more.
I assing oyer a few grocer’s bills, which
have evidently got on to the file by accident,
I discover the aborted impulse of what might
H a Y e ”sen a fine nautical inspiration. Title •
The Hobs of Hell.”
I have writ you as I found you,
Oh, you God-forgotten sinner....
Ah, the men who sailed with Jason
And the men who slung his freight
Apparently I meditated at the moment a
new version of “The Odyssey,” done in
Masehelds later manner; although, judging
the copy-paper—which is that of the
old Sydney Sunday Times— this fragment
preceded Masefield’s discovery of me in
Academy and Literature,” my subsequent
correspondence with him, and his wonderful
literary evolution and deserved success.
Arfi,4? ar ®pthesis, Masefield’s few remarks in
his Gallipoli about the Australians appeal
more to me than anything yet said or writ-
ten about our public appearances during the
war period.) h
, ir js dies with inkstained fingers, unshaven
writers, and literary critics wearing long
hair and big bow ties! The next item on
the catalogue is an article from an ullaged
“\ir e di po ®, ticajl porcelain-wreaths entitled
My Place. It is done in black ink on
white paper, as follows:
I love the land I live in
And when my goal is won,
The good strife bravely striven,
The brave fight fitly done,
Where some old gum or mvall
Uplifted tall -may be,
Lay down the earthly remnant
Of what was me
I can see what happened here. The mvall
is a squat, spreading tree. It cannot fitly
K e f e i uplifted or “tall,” and in the
5t *„ ri °l en llne . th e only word that occurs
to fill the gap is Alas!” making the line
to read: Of what, alas! was me.” It
sounded too pussy. A first and ultimate
witlx the Irish is pride
There are several job lots, but, owing to
the requirements of the trade, one cannot
bulk. them. These we will consign to the
bulging waste-paper baskets, the discarded
dumps or rubbish-tips of creative effort.
Between a kindly letter from my publisher
and friend, Edward Arnold, of London and
a newspaper clipping about Big Jack Mor-
nssey, the subsequent “broncho buster”
who „ h „ eI P ed m e to drive “The Kina’s Cara-
van from, Chatsworth to Townsville I find
an uncut gem. Title and verse:—

This was a most promising bush poem. It

I pass m a lot of damaged sentimental
goods (the reserves are too high), and come
to a () sea-stained item entitled “Captain’s

ing along the main highway. A scrappy

The Writer and His Audience
An overseas review, worrying over th
question why Australia has not producec
any distinctive literature—it takes that fo
granted—comes to the conclusion that it ;
because we have no real audience. No cu
tivated and compact one, that is. In th
older countries with a cultural tradition, i
is contended, any writer of talent feels tha
he is in touch with a responsive public, am
consequently “he withholds nothing/’ I
our case, on the other hand, any write
would have to find the common denominate
or a promiscuous mass of readers, and s
there is no chance for the individual elemen
that creates literature. “Almost all th
work produced is without style or art.”
It is not worth while contradicting th
premises of this argument. The interestin
questions are whether a responsive audienc
is necessary to a writer, and whether we hav
got one. As far as poetry is concerned, it i
fairly easy to demonstrate that the audienc
does not matter very much. A man write
a lyric because he wants' to write it. Th
main part of it may be shaped while he i
working in his garden or Sitting on a ferry
boat. He gets no stimulus from the though
ot possible readers, or practically none. Con
ceivably he might begin poems (and even fin
ish them) if he were marooned on, a deser
island, with no hope of rescue and no promise
ot an audience. With prose it is different. A
man does not accomplish a long novel in a
spmt of careless rapture, though the creative
impulse alone might be strong enough -to
drive him to the planning of it, and even to
the writing o£ a few chapters. As soon as
lie begins presenting his matter, though, the
question of the audience he is addressing
enters his mind. He cannot humbug himself
that it is a matter of pure self-expression,
.o matter how elaborate his method, he is,
in tact, telling a tale to someone, and when
once that fact is admitted the question of an
audience becomes important—its quality and
responsiveness. His work is bound to be
affected by these two factors. If he feels he
is talking in a void he will either change his
position or close his mouth. That, I sup-
pose, is what our critic meant by a writer
withholding” himself.
A compact and responsive audience, on the
other hand, can draw out a writer, tempting
him to explore the fullest depths of his
is , a deling of communi-
cation established, almost as definite as in
ne theatre. Have we an audience, in this
sense of the word? Certainly, says the
average reader. Look at the number of
bookshops all around, and the crowds of
literate people in the trams and the trains'
Look at the bright little articles .about Mase-

tion to literature is about the same as that

of a casual pedestrian to the orchestra play-
ing in a hall he is passing.
But is Australia's relation any better? Is
there any considerable body of people capable
of making a reputation for a book of quality
Sadly and reluctantly we must answer in
the negative. D. H. Lawrence’s two novels,
“Kangaroo” and “The Boy in the Bush,
were a fair test of the matter. He is an
English writer of genius working with Aus-
tralian material, and as the direct audience
we might be expected to have an opinion of
our own about the extent to which he has
succeeded. Yet, judging by the amount of
interest their appearance has created, we
have no opinion. We sit in the darkened
gallery waiting with pricked ears for the
applause or hisses from the stalls. It is
safe to state that the Australian circulation
of these books will be in exact proportion to
the demand for them abroad, and the
amount of enthusiasm they arouse among
oversea critics. The “colonial” edition, is
the measure of our importance. It consists
of the remaindered copies oi other editions
put in slightly cheaper covers.
And so the nicely-stocked bookshops, the
little articles about Masefield, the eager
women breasting the counters of lending
libraries, all seem to mean nothing but that
we have a public capable of responding to
the hints and adumbrations of distant voices.
A reasonably intelligent public, of course!
In its promiscuous)!css, vagueness and lack
of any kind of unity, though, it is essentially
different from an audience. All audience,
however small, is a live thing, with its own
initiative and power of response. Probably
after a century or so of intensive culture we
will be able to grow one of our own.
VANCE PALMER.
Rejuvenation
The world took little notice of Milton
when he declared that “spirits at wall can
either sex assume.” According to Dr Nor-
man Ilaire it is listening respectfully to
Steinach, who has found by experiment that
the privilege of spirits can be shared by men.
This devastating suggestion is, however,
merely hinted at by Haire, who devotes most
of his Rejuvenation (Allen arid Unwin) to
Steinach’s attempts (many of them appa-
rently successful, to rekindle youth’s flame
in the ashes of age.
The book has a special interest for Aus-
tralians since Haire. now practising in Lon-
don, lived most of his 32 years in Sydney,
and is a graduate of its University. lie
recounts the strange experiments of Stein-
ach, of Vienna, who has worked out two
methods. For women and certain male
patients he uses grafts of the appropriate
human generative glands—unlike the French-
man Yoronof, who grafts monkey glands.
But the Viennese has obtained his chief suc-
cesses by ligaturing the spermatic duct, a
simple operation which is often folloxved, not
by actual rejuvenation, but by a regenera-
tion of the whole body through the stimula-
tion of an internal secretion. Steinach and
his disciples have had many striking suc-
cesses, and some unaccountable failures, with
this method, which cannot be applied to
women.
On his return from Vienna Dr. Haire per-
formed the operation 25 times. Red Page
readers will be interested painfully in the
case of “A. 8.,” a novelist of 53, who wrote
“a new book, several short stories and some
one-act plays” a few months after the opera-
tion was performed upon him. The “before”
picture follows: “He sits in a semi-stupid
condition in an armchair or on the sofa all
day, often will not eat unless fed like a
child. His clothes hang on him-—they would
go twice round him—and are all stained with
food droppings.” The rest of this picture of
“senium praecox”—or is it obsenium praecqx?
—has to be screened.
To the philosophically minded the most
provocative part of the book is the account of
Steinach’s experiments with animals. Male
and female rats, sterile and decrepit with
age, were rejuvenated and enabled to produce
young, and by transplantation of glands
young animals were literally unsexod. males
becoming feminised and females being given
many of the characteristics of the male, to
the bewilderment of their relatives. Steinach.
says Dr. Haire, “showed conclusively that
the phenomena of puberty and of sexual de-
velopment. both physical and psychical, are
governed by the internal-secretory elements
of the sex-glands.”
The imagination leaps to the human sub-
ject : can the complex fabric of a personality
be so terribly distorted by a few sweeps of
the scalpel l The harem has for ages excited
the world’s contemptuous pity with a type
that evades definition —male without virility,
womanish yet not feminine. And among our-
selves exists another and more notorious
type, whose peculiarities are the sport not of
man but of nature. Lichtenstern has suc-
ceeded. with appropriate grafts, in making
examples of the latter type psychologically
normal. Would an exchange of grafts
between a normal man and a normal woman
increase by two the already large population
of hybrids?
One may theorise, of course, but the scien-
tist who will answer this question must
practise not only medicine but crime.

Art and Sterility
Now whatever was “C.8.M.” (R.P.
11/12/’24) thinking of when he called Spain
artificially barren? Maybe in Schenectady
they haven’t heard of Zurbaran and Ribera,
but there was once a Spanish artist named
Murillo whom all the world (including
Schenectady) knows. And there is Velas-
quez, father of modern painting—Velasquez
who stands beside Rembrandt; Velasquez the
superb. Then in a later age Spain gave us
Goya, perhaps that Blamire Young might
explain him from Australia, and perhaps
that his art might express her inmost soul
And there are many painters to-day in Spain,
chief amongst them Znloago. whose fame
is blown about the earth —hut not to Schenec-
tady! In literature Portugal has her
famoens, Spain her Calderon. Theresa. Lope
da Vego and that Don Jorge Manrique
whom Longfellow made known to his com-
patriots. And Cervantes !—Cervantes, one of
those world-writers who are not perhaps out-
side the Greeks and Romans, so numerous
as “C.8.M.” imagines. For of all the great
English novelists of the Victorian epoch
Dickens alone has captured the hearts of
non-English-speaking peoples, and England’s
one world-poet besides Shakspeare is Byron
—not Wordsworth and not Keats. That is
to say, the one poet who is read everywhere,
and has profoundly influenced foreign litera-
tures. Shelley is but little known upon the
continent of Europe; he is said, however,
to be" much read by cultivated Indians.
But what of Russia, who, lagging behind
in the progress of the ages (says “C.8.M.”
grandiloquently from Schenectady), has con-
demned herself to sterility? It is a marvel-
lous sterility that has produced Tsehaikowsky
and the makers of glorious opera, and in
literature Tolstoi, Tourgcnieff, Dovstoevsky
—all world-writers—and Gogol and Gorki,
whom we know, and how T many that we
don’t! May this kind of mantle of sterility
cover us also, that under it we may shelter
equally vigorous children of the brain!
But there seems to be some confusion in
“C.B.M.'s” reasoning. In the bottom of
his heart he probably believes that genius
is always well-washed, and can only move
along a path lit with electric light and strewn
with telephones. But it is perfectly pos-
sible to have a very high musical, or artistic,
or poetic culture whose florescence is genius,
combined with a very low standard of mat-
erial comfort. The grubby Neapolitan may
he operatically better trained than the well-
batlied Australian who calls him “Dago.”
And the Russian peasant, judging from an
exhibition of carvings, needlework and the
like held in London a year or two back,
may have an infinitely keener sense of form
arid color than the average educated Anglo-
Saxon art-nnd-crafter. So also the life of
Edgar Allan Poe may often have fallen be-
low the lofty level of Schenectady, hut that
does not prevent him from being the only
American writer who has greatly assisted in
the development of a literary art in Europe.
DORA WILCOX.
Australian Production
An Englishman puts Bedford in his place:
Randolph Bedford, in his venomous muck on Aus-
tralian Production (R.P. 18/12/’24), reveals exactly
where he stands with regard to Britain.
Take one statement alone—“ Australia isn’t British.”
They tell me, to my great surprise, that this man
Bedford is actually a member of Parliament out here.
I don’t attempt to debate the point—it makes me
sick when one can point to the hand of Britain
in everything worth while in this country—-laws,
church, universities, people, literature (what little
there is), medicine, etc.
Why doesn't Bedford get the dirty water olf his
chest, and broadcast all over the continent: “I per-
sonally hate England. I'll write all sorts of illogical
and untrue statements (and get The Bulletin to
publish them), work myself into a frenzy of hate
and see what happens”? Nothing, of course, would
happen—-the Australian would simply sit back (and
applaud the nun who are commencing work on ihe
Singapore Base), and then go off to the beach or
the races and forget the whole damn thing. Because
of this casual, care-free spirit, we allow a man like
Bedford plenty of room to spread himself. Unfortu-
nately there are a number of people in the Back-
blocks who drink in every word they read —-especially
on a question like the one tackled here.
A paper, ccn Yantly expressing such thoughts, could
do quite a lot of harm in Australia —sowing the
seeds of discontent and hatred of British “rule.”
When Germany had something of an Empire, one
could never imagine a, paid Government servant in
German E. Africa, for example, proudly claiming
that German E. Africa was not German. We would
all feel our contempt for a man like that.
England, we learn from Bedford —the man of
letters—is a semi-illiterate country. That, to me,
coming from such a nonentity, is something like an
arrogant little ragamuffin cheeking the Chief Justice.
Bedford couldn’t have made a more unfortunate
remark. As one who has lived over 20 years in Europe
(with a University course there), and also had the
advantage of living in three different parts of the
Empire, I say without hesitation that where Australia
shows up worst in comparison is in her literature.
In the older countries of the world, on the other
hand, we find that England occupies the leading
place—much more so than America. At present
England is particularly well represented. One need
only take a few of the names who have won this
place in twentieth-century literature for England:
G. B. Shaw, G. K. Chesterton, 11. G. Wells, R.
Kipling, Thomas Hardy, Barrie, the Bin ions and
50 more I could name off-hand.
Everyone knows that Australia has done magnifi-
cently in the handful of years she has been going.
But don’t, you think that it’s a little too early yet
to talk to England about literature ? The “bounce”
method comes off in business very often—it gets
men into Parliament, but on questions of cul-
ture !
Stan IV. Grist (late Bristol University, Eng.).
A Satchel of Books
Morrissey, by Edmund Downey (John Lane). The
author has written many novels, all bearing the
characteristic of a happy-go-lucky humor. This
one makes demand neither on close attention nor
intellectual effort.
The White Devil of the Black Sea, by Lewis Stan-
ton Palen (John Lane). An alleged translation of
the alleged narrative of a loyalist Russian officer de-
scribing his adventures in the heart of Bolshevik
Russia from the beginning of . the Revolution to the
collapse of the “White Army.” It is described as
“an almost incredible true story.” We will not
answer for the truth, but will swear to the incredi-
bility.
Unscientific Essays, by Frederic Wood Jones
(Edward Arnold). The Elder Professor of Anatomy
in Adelaide ’Varsity has allowed his mind to stray
back to the sp- /ions days when he was doctor rn
a cable-repairing ship and medico on Cocos atoll.
Quaintly allusive reminiscences strung on a thread
of pleasant philosophy. The chapter on Sneezing
just misses being as good as Lamb’s Essay on
Roast Pork.
The Life and Letters of Walter 11. Page, by Burton
J. Hendrick (Heinemann). A new and cheaper
edition of a work which has been already reviewed on
this page, and which has won for itself a high place
among biographies. That over 50,000 copies of the
original edition have been sold in England and America
is probably the best testimony that can be given of
public appreciation, no less of the author’s work than
of the subject’s services to the Great Republic he
served and the Great Empire to which he was his
country’s ambassador.
The Mind of Mark, by IT. Herman Chilton (Ed-
ward Arnold). A quite notable first novel. It is
the study of a self-made Midland manufacturer whose
success nourishes in him arrogance and mastery. A
strike brings about a crisis in his life. He bends
the Board of directors to his will till they become
mere puppets in his hand. The affair assumes
violent features. In the riot Rawson is struck by a
stone, and the injury lays him on a bed of sickness.
On a trip of convalescence he begins to vision “coin-
promise as the solvent between life and the soulless
imperative of gain.” On his return he proposes a
policy of give and take. This change of front antago-
nises his fellow shareholders, alienates his friends,
and in the fear of lost fortune withdraws from him
the affection of his family. The book closes with a
note of tragedy reminding us of Lear. A powerful,
thoughtful book.
Three Pilgrims and a Tinker, by Mary Borden
(Heinemann). This author has produced consistently
good work, “Jane —the Stranger” and “The Romantic
Woman,” among others, giving her a high place
among the women writers of the fiction of to-day.
This latest novel shows no falling off in the quali-
ties of sincerity and sympathy, though cast in a
somewhat different mood. It deals with the domestic
affairs and fortunes of Jim and Marion Dawniy, a
happy-go-lucky young couple who, at the end a their
tether, transfer themselves from the gay European
towns through which they have fluttered, to the rigor
of country life with its staid respectability. 'the
“Three Pilgrims” is a society constituted by the
youngsters, with baby Tim, “The Tinker,” as an
associate. The sketch of the lovable Jim, with lips
closed to adults but open to children, is delightfully
done.
The Story of Port Hacking, Cr'onulla and Sutherland
Shire, by Frank Cridland (Angus and Robertson).
It sometimes happens that a tract of country, though
abundant, in historical interest, is curiously over-
looked ; and the libraries, though well supplied with
histories of other districts of N. S. Wales, contain
but few references to this one. Yet it was here, at
Kurnell that Captain Cook first landed in Australia ;
Port Hacking was discovered as far back as March
30, 1798. by that pair of fearless navigators, George
Bass and Matthew Flinders; and the Shire takes its
name from Forby Sutherland, a sailor on the
Endeavor, and the first white man to die and be
buried in Australia. Even Mr. Cridland’s book is
not quite a history; rather it is a collection of
sketches touching upon the story of the Shire's
discovery, its characteristics and multitudinous
changes that have taken place as civilisation has en-
croached upon the preserve of Black Brother. And
though its author is neither historian, botanist nor
zoologist, he has managed to make the book enter-
taining.
London Inns and Taverns, by Leopold Wagner
(Allen and Unwin). A pleasant ramble among the
ancient liostelrics of London. Inns made familiar to
us in literature are described, so that we may pic-
ture Shakspenre at the Bell Tavern, Pep.vs at. the
Pope’s Head Tavern, the Black Swan associated with
the Gordon riots, and the Bolt-in Inn, where Dickens
met/ Pickwick. Of inns known to the travelling Aus-
tralian mention is made of the old Cheshire Cheese,
in Fleet-street, concerning which it is said “among
the thousands of sightseers who partake of its gener-
ous fare during the summer season, very few are
privileged to inspect the vaulted cellars with the
wrought-iron fifteenth-century gate and the now
walled-up passage leading deep down beneath the
turmoil of traffic towards the river through which
many a fugitive from the law reached the ancient
sanctuary of Whitefriars in perfect safety.”
The Constant Nymph, by Margaret Kennedy (Heine-
mann). “Sanger’s Circus” was the nickname given
to a family whose head was an erratic musical genius.
The “circus” lived a wandering existence, its members
marked by “their vulgarity, their conspicuous bril-
liance, the noise they made and the kind of naphtha-
flare genius which illumed everything they did.”
Sanger was related to an English family associated
with University life, and as highly conventionalised
as the feckless and easy living members of the
“circus” were the opposite. The younger Sangers
being left unprovided for, the English family comes to
their rescue. The transfer of the “circus” from their
Alpine home to England brings the daughter of the
dead man’s relatives in touch with Lewis Dodd, a
young musician devoted to the Sangers. The tale
is clearly told, and the author skilfully analyses the
elements of character in those two opposing out-
looks upon life which render conflict inevitable.
The Secret of the Garden, by Arthur Gask (Herbert
Jenkins). The hero starts his career, for the pur-
poses of the story, in the dock of a criminal court
in Adelaide. Of course he was wrongly accused ;
this class of hero always is. The presiding Judge is
described as “a consequential, bombastic old fool,
He was curled and scented and had beautiful white
hands. He was a well-known fop in private life....
He had a cold, worn voice, and was a pillar of
the Church in his spare time. He was great on

of Australia to have attracted of late the

Matter and the Atom, by Alfred Bcrthoud (Allen
and Unwin). This exposition of the new theories
Ilna“Ffrt 1 lna “F f r t iW( j th « atom .’ 1 translated from
the o™ l written by the well-known Professor
of Pl| .v«ical Chemistry, is not primarily intended for
specialists but endeavors to convey to the layman an
acc ° mt °t the work which has been dene by moderns
0,1 t ~s 1 10,, f h nlore than twenty centuries
«KO Democritus and others taught that all bodies are
"tadc up of indivisible particles, the ancient doctrine
1,8 llttle in common with the atomic theory of to-day.
1 "'?* nothing more than a metaphysical conception
. <lev ?. ,d of experimental basis. The ancient theory was
1,1 the Middle Ages practically lost sight of, and
only reappeared in the seyententh century, in the
IV rimgs of Descartes and Boyle, and it was not till
the nineteenth century that by the research, of Dalton
the two essential constituents of the modern atomic-
the,?U' the la ™ s of constant proportions and of
multiple proportions, were established. AH the ele-
rnents, it was hold, are made up ot minute particles—
Hie atoms—which remain indivisible during chemical
reactions. The atoms of any one element arc identical
and all have the same weight, whereas the atoms of
different elements differ from one another. . Chemical
compounds are produced by the juxtaposition of the
atoms of the elements combined to form them, and
these atoms unite in definite numbers to constitute
molecules. This theory, though it may not to-day be
accepted without reserve, underlies the interpretation
of all chemical phenomena. .Modern investigation
carries us a step further. Chemists and physicists
have reason to believe that these atoms do not
represent the last stage in the subdivision of matter,
hot are complex systems. The discovery of the Riint-
rays, followed by that of radio-activity, “furnished
insuperable evidence of the complexity of atoms. ’
Upon this came the discovery of the electron as ore
of the constituents of the atom, in fact, the solution
oi ' the problem of its constitution calls into service
all the great discoveries in the fields of experimental
research, and the day appears far distant when the
final word bn the subject will have been said.

The way was green, the way was brown.
The pipe! was an elfin man
And liusset Runder was his name;
His shoes shone like a crescent-moon,
His jaunty cap was like a flame
Upon his long and tangled locks.
I followed him as he passed by.
He was a merry little man —
Tee-ooril-ali, tee-ooril-i!
The way was brown, the way green,
The way was shining with the Spring
The merry day that Russet piped
O’er hill and dale tee-ooril-ing.
And as he gaily piped I danced
The hours away on wingfed feet
Up five and twenty little hills
All white with dew and blossom sweet.
And three blue-birds tossed us a song;
And seven rabbits in a row
In sudden quaint bewilderment
Whisked quickly by—tee-ooril-oh !
And when we reached the little town
Where I so very gravely dwell
1 bade the merry man good-bye;
But ah —alas —his magic spell
And magic pipes I’ll always feel
Are luring me away, away
Far o’er the little shining hill;;
Tee-ooril-i, tee-ooril-aye!

Grass Against the Sea.
I have an anodyne
More powerful than wine
Or poppy juice for any ills that be.
it is a place made fair
By blue and sea-bright air.
A patch of wild grass-garden high and free.
Old thoughts that brood and burn
Are chased beyond return
By sight of this cliff ledge
With all about its edge
In swaying rhapsody
Long grass against the sea.
The cushioned turf around,
The sandy, sunburnt ground
With saltness of past spray soaked through
and through,
The sweet smell of crushed grass,
The bay like azure glass
(Hew far below its hushing drone and coo!) ;
A sky without a stain
Whence color drips like rain
On tiny nameless flow T ers—
These fill my blessed hours
With not a thing to do
But dream into the blue.
The sea-pinks’ satin stars
Trace rose and violet bars
Through seed and plume and spire and downy
burr;
And spun like spangled mist
Daisies of amethyst
Are fanned by little wings of gauze a-whir.
Wliat’s money worth or woe
Or aims that draw me so?
Stretched here supine and flat,
Like a wise pussy-cat
When soft hands stroke her fur,
I simply lie and purr.
Between the sea and sky,
Where warm winds gossip by,
Then turn again in idle amity.
Where all is clean and sane
With joy my tired brain
Sees worries of the darkness fade and flee.
Among the generous clover
I count my riches over.
Man’s honors proud and high
Have coldly passed me by,
But fate has given to me
Long grass against the sea!

From a Window.
When I look from my window all I sec
Is a pale wilderness of bush and sky—
Green against blue—blue through each dis-
tant tree —
Green —blue—monotonously low and high.
Yet if I leave my desk and saunter out,
What shall I find at every step I take
But color, color, color strewn about
In jewelled lights and fairy fires awake?
I know the oak-tree near the creek is
brown —
A tawny maid with drooping, downcast
eyes,
And sunburnt limbs. Beneath the shadows
drown
Like dreams in a lost desert grown death-
wise.
Under the ti-trees brilliant beetles lie —
Symbols of Egypt—emerald and gold.
On such great Cleopatra looked to sigh—
A shining scarab token ten worlds old.
Color? Oh. it would cry to me in pain
From daisy-plates of pink snow in the
grass,
From redheads, flocking thick in Autumn's
train.
That scatter like red pearls to see me
pass!
Yet from my window all my eyes behold
Is a pale wilderness the long day through—
Green against blue in trees and skies world-
old—
Green-blue monotony of hours too new!

MA STATE’S CROOKED WAYS.
“The N.S.W. Public Works Committee yesterday
agreed to the construction of a railway line from
Sandy Hollow, via (lul gong, to Mary Vale. Tho
work will be 1464 miles in length, and the estimated
cost is £\ ,172,805.... The line is desirable from
tlie point of view of decentralisation, as a connecting
link between the North and the West, and would
give settlers in the Central West an opening to the
northern ports.” —Daily paper.
The remark about “decentralisation” and
“an opening to the northern ports” is, of
course, not intended to be taken seriously.
The new line, like the one from Binnaway
to Werris Creek, will certainly open on to
the northern railway, but though that runs
parallel to the coast it doesn’t connect with
any northern port nearer than Brisbane. In
this respect it resembles the line which runs
parallel with the coast from Goulburn to
Bombala, yet doesn’t connect with any south-
ern port—not even with Melbourne, and isn’t
intended to, the proposed extension being
inland and Uphill. The big undertaking
which is to cost £1,172,805 is another illus-
tration of the fact that so long as a railway
is guaranteed to give access to no new port,
to create no new city, and to shorten the dis-
tance to nowhere, it may be an addition to
the oldest and worst bankrupt that the Ma
State possesses, and no jack-in-office cares.
Sandy Flat, which is between Myambat and
Wappinguy, is half-way along a very un-
payable branch, so the proposed work will
be a branch off a branch. On its way to
Mary Vale it will parallel and almost col-
lide with two other bankrupt branches, for
stumpy little railways are as thick in these
parts as aldermen with no visible means of
support. In this respect, however, the pro-
posal is barely so outrageous as the previous
week’s wild cat, which was the P. W. Com-
mittee’s recommendation of a job, or joblet,
from Canowindra to Gregra. Canowindra

Stretch about 200 miles in length
up north, where the people want a
new State, so that they can build
public works for themselves. There
is no branch to the coast, and all
proposals for one are turned down.
No ncio lines are projected in this
area. The railway just visible on
the left goes west for 96 miles, and
then turns south to Sydney.
is where the Cowra line (loss, £225 per
mile per annum) and the Eugowra one (loss
£4Bl p.m. p.a.) meet. They are both attach-
ments of the Blayney-Deniondrillo “perma-
nent and reproductive work” (loss, £921 per
mile per annum), and lie almost touching
the Koorawatha-Grenfell and Stockinbingal-
Forbes affairs—both highly non-payable. The
wild cat of the week before the previous
. one was the Committee’s passing of a line
from the Rand to Bull Plain. The existing
iron way to the Rand covers neither interest
nor working expenses. The extension will
be an addition to a maze of scraps, stumps
and dead-ends, such as Cootamundra-Tumut,
Gilmore-Kunama, Wagga-Tumbarumba, Cul-
cairn-Corowa, Culcairn-Holbrook, Narran-
dera-Tocumwal and the Rock-Oaklands—all
heavy losers, and four of them mot only pay-
ing nothing towards interest, but charging
a great part of their expense’ bills to the
Treasury. In that corner of N. S. Wales
railways are almost as numerous as persons
who want to be unpaid aldermen.
*** * •
In further pursuit of “decentralisation”
and the bestowment upon' settlers of “an
opening to the northern ports” or any other,
ports, the P. W. Committee, after the first
lines of this article had been written, pro-
duced its fourth consecutive wildcat within
a month. It proposed a railway from Cooma,
situated on a branch line (Goulburn-Bom-
bala) which ' has shown itself capable of
losing £118,600 in, a year, and which has no
known of visible hope of permanent improve-
MORE N.S.W. RAILWAYS.

jected here.
ment unless carried on another few miles to
the fine port of Eden. The proposed enter-
prise isn’t to go easterly downhill to the
port, bur westerly uphill to the peaceful
hamlet of Berridale, which is on the way
to the rocky surroundings of the Upper
Murray. The cost is reckoned at £11.500
per mile, which wouldn’t be much for a line
to a harbor, but is a great deal for one to
a heifer. The trade, if any, will go to Syd-
ney. The reason assigned for the amazing
proposal is that the Government has acquired
20.566 acres of land for settlement in the
neighborhood—quite a decent paddock, so to
speak. Some fatality appears to attach to
the policy of stumpy dead-end branches,
which branch off other branches, which,
being followed up, lead to the parent tree,
with its roots in the capital. The agricul-
tural population is officially estimated as
being less than it was 10 years ago, and the
small-town manufactures are dying fast, and
being replaced by big-city manufactures. Not
having much but wheat to carry, and wheat
being carried at half-cost, or less than one-
fifth the wool rate, many of the new public
works are naturally in trouble.
*** • •
If the recent expert investigators had been
given a chance to say something about the
unmitigated stupidity of the whole business
(which they were not, it being outside the
limits of their commission!, it would have
made no difference. The Fuller Ministry
is so colorless as to be almost invisible, and
it is so anxious not to take extreme measures
that it would probably use lager beer to
restore the apparently* drowned. It hasn’t
the heart to be unkind even to a pony club.
Of the recommendations which the experts
made the only one which seems likely to sur-
vive is that the system will be “decentral-
ised” by calling some district officials “Com-
missioners” instead of calling them what
they are called now, but authority will re-
main congested at the old spot. One of the
experts, by the way, bestowed an unfortu-
nate patch of whitewash which made the old
brigade feel better than it had any right to
do. It was thus reported:—
Sir Sam Fay said to Sir Mark Sheldon in public
examination: “Do you know any other country in
the world where the railways as a whole, State' and
private, have paid 5 per cent, at any time during
the last ten years?” He put the same question
to other important witnesses. They did not know,
of course. Neither did Sir Sam Fay, and he con-
fessed it quite frankly.
It was a curious episode. N. 8. Wales pos-
sesses 7316 miles of railway if it is measured
as “single track, including sidings and cross-
overs,” as the official return puts it, and the
capital borrowed and spent was £93,355,167.
That is about £12,760 per mile to pay in-
terest on. J. Bull oyns 51,536 miles of
track by the same mode of measurement,
and, largely because all the land had to be
bought from private owners, the lot seems
to have cost the Old Man £21,633 per mile,
which is a big sum to earn dividends on. On
the total issued capital, including watered
stock, the average dividend paid in 1922, at
which point Whitaker’s last record stops,
is said to have been £4 14s. lOd. per cent.
Adding 13s. per cent, paid in rates and
taxes, for the British Government makes a
big profit out of the local lines though it
doesn’t own them, the visible net earnings
£s 7s. lOd. per cent., and if the
earnings are calculated on actual capital in-
stead of watered capital they would be con-
siderably more. Considering the compara-
tively small amount which the N. S. Wales
system lias to earn dividends on the record
return of £5 2s. 7d. per cent, doesn't appear
a marvellous advertisement for the One Big
Port policy, though it was kind of the visitor
with the monosyllabic name to put the matter
as he did.
THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH.
The discussion of a public question in an
ordinary meeting of citizens may lead to
many changes of opinion, and in a general
way the results may justify a good deal of
talk. The discussion of bills in Parliament
on the motion for their second reading has
long ceased to change any opinions, and is
quite without results. No matter what new
information may be brought forward, no
matter what arguments may be used, once
the question before the House has
been made a party question the number
of rotes for and against is known.
Theoretically, the King, or his deputy, the
Governor, calls Parliament together to dis-
cuss measures for the public good. Each
member of the legislative body is supposed
to have a conscience and some intelligence;
but the intelligence is rarely applied to the
matter in hand, and the conscience demands
nothing more than loyalty to a party. In
other words, political combines have taken
away all the meaning of discussion and
cheated the people out of their right to have
their affairs honestly looked at from every
angle. The question, naturally arises: Why
are speeches made if'they have no effect upon
the votes? The/answer is that Parliament
keeps up a pretence of discussion because its
members know they are shirking their real
job. For it- is as much a member’s business to
keep an open mind, which is capable of being
convinced that views previously held are
wrong, as it is his business to try to con-
vince opponents that the views he holds are
right. If this were not so there could be
no reason for electing a Parliament at all;
. i that would be needed would be an execu-
tive to turn proposals sanctioned at the ballot-
box into laws.
• * , * * *
! ie ffee_ discussion is supposed to
be the basis on which democracy rests. But
the parties have combined to "defeat demo-
cracy, and to see that the country takes
what is given it without question. Such an
arrangement strikes at the root of reform.
Every important bill must face the confusion
of tongues and the mock enthusiasm of the
people's representatives; but long before it
does so it lias been shaped by a small min-
onty of one party and decided upon in secret
conclave. Thus the public is additionally
cheated; for the members of the Parliament
have, conspired together to allow the will of
a , min 'wily to have sway, without testing
whateanijjglit. be the free and honest opinion
of the-?ma.iority. Occasionally, indeed, a
member makes a speech against a measure
and then votes for it. Such an action is
not regarded as criminal nor even dishonor-
able, and the Speaker, who is supposed
to be the upholder of the honor of
Parliament, makes no reference to it.
Presumably the member has the right
to change his mind between the mak-
ing of the speech and the ringing of the divi-
sion bell; but everyone knows that he has
not changed his mind. He has simply sacri-
ficed truth and his duty to his constituents
at the call of party. The party machine
controls the selection of candidates, largely
controls the election itself, dictates the
opinions of members, and prevents freedom of
thought among those who seek its favor.
Under such an arrangement the will of the
people has no chance whatever, and the so-
called representatives do not speak in the
name of their constituents. Yet the public
choice at the triennial election is confined
to a vote for one party machine or another:
and the mark is made on the ballot-paper
with the certainty that the things considered
most vital by the. elector—the tilings of which
he would like his representative to speak—•
will never get a hearing in Parliament.
* * * *
Within wfide limits a man may stand in
the street or in a public hall and say what
he likes. Yet in Parliament, where special
privileges are granted to members to say
what they dare not say in the street, no such
freedom exists. Party has filched away that
freedom, and no word may be spoken on
vital matters on other lines than those
which the party wills. Not only is this so,
but the nature of the party’s will itself must
be considered. That will does not represent
tlie consensus of co-ordinated opinion of the
adherents of the party in the constituencies,
nor even the carefully considered points on
which the elected members are in agreement.
It is entirely a hole-and-corner business—the
work of small cliques calling themselves
leagues and conferences of leagues, and domi-
nated in almost every case by people of nar-
row outlook and bitter prejudice. These
people make the policy and select the
candidates; and as the selection of a
candidate in many constituencies means
certainty of election at the polls, it
follows that these small groups of
people have usurped the whole function
of democracy and made the ballot a farce.
Under the circumstances it is hardly sur-
prising that few men of ability and integ-
rity are willing to enter political life. In
such life there is the constant irk of the
fetters. imposed by lesser minds. So demo-
cracy is further cheated in that party has
denied it the help of the men who could best
serve the country. Oratory is at its lowest
ebb. In its place we have the poor business
of trying to devise new forms of personal
abuse to distress opponents. There is any
amount of cant, any amount of feeble wit,
or what passes for wit among weakened
intelligences ; but it is seriously to be ques-
tioned whether in the seven Parliaments of
Australia a single sentence worth preserving
has been spoken in the last ten years. This
does not mean that all the so-called repre-
sentatives of the people are entirely ignorant
or wholly deficient in ability. Though the
average is certainly low, and shows signs
ot sinking lower, there are members of all
parties who are quite the mental equals of
most of those whom they are supposed to
represent; and here and there is a man
who, if given the opportunity, might rise
high. The fault lies with the parties. No-
thing worth saying is said in Parliament be-
cause nothing is worth saying there. Where
matters are all cut and dried, aud where
individual mind and conscience are political
offences, it is hopeless to look for either
brilliance or the expression of sound sense.
A member might just as well repeat the
Lord s Prayer backwards as make the sort
?>- speech which is printed at public expense
m Hansard. Australia is in plain fact poli-
tically dumb, though many voices continue
to gibber. Only the little political cliques,
which m the aggregate are party, have any
say. Party is the enemy of the people, and
democracy cannot exist where party rules.
THE RIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC.
If Australia suddenly sank beneath the
waves leaving nothing above but Sydney,
and if, after the lapse of centuries, during
which \\ estern civilisation had disappeared
and become forgotten, the city were discov-
ered by voyagers from Korea, it would pre-
sent to them just such a riddle as
Faster Island presents to Western obser-
vers to-day. And if the voyagers found
among the ruins a handful of degen-
eiate savages who eked out a precari-
ous existence by fishing and cultivat-
ing potatoes, the parallel would be pretty
exact. The problem of Sydney would, how-
ever, be easier to solve than that of Easter
Island. A glance at the remains of business
houses and public buildings would show the
Orientals that the city could not have existed
without an extensive countryside which had
vanished without trace. But the ruins on
Faster Island, that tiny speck of barren
rock set midway in the south-eastern Pacific
and hundreds of miles from the nearest lonely
islet, are not the ruins of a city, but of a
graveyard- a graveyard that stretches in
great burial platforms, sometimes four to
five hundred feet long, for 30 miles
along the empty coast. These burial plat-
forms are made of cyclopean masonry, of
huge stones weighing from two to twentv
tons, all shaped and tooled by hand. There
are on the island hundreds of thousands of
tons of stone thus chipped into shape. They
represent a labor greater than that which
built the Pyramids. And scattered every-
where, staring at the sea, frowning at the
hillsides, lying on their faces half arranged
in avenues, are the strange, baffling sphinxes
that have made Easter Island famous. Im-
mense busts, some of them 80 feet in length,
with deep-set eyes, long noses, thin, cruel,
masterful lips, mighty chins and no backs to
their heads. And these statues are not the
crude idols of savage worshippers: they are
portraits. They are images of actual people,
and there is personality stamped on each of
them. The features are those of a conquer-
ing race.
Yet Easter Island could never have sup-
plied the food to sustain more than a few
thousand people. It is composed of porous
rock through which the rains soak as through
a sponge, and there are no signs that forest
ever grew upon it. The present miserable
inhabitants know nothing of the origin of
the. statues or of the meaning of their ancient
script. Their women, like the mothers of
many other Polynesian tribes, still massage
their children’s heads to conform with the
flat-backed ideal of beauty perpetuated by
the images, _ and the men hand down the
legendary history which begins with llotu
Matua, their great founder. This mighty
navigator, driven by some great cataclysm
out of his native archipelago, Marae Renga,
after a remarkable voyage via Maoriland
arrived at Easter Island with the banana,


tlie sugar-cane, cloth and cordage plants
and the arrowroot plant, which made life
on the rock possible. The first inspection
of the island’s possibilities ordered by him
was unfavorable. “The land is worthless:
grass swallows all you plant,” was the re-
port of his scouts. They advised him to re-
turn to their own good country, Marae
Renga. Hotu replied that it was useless
going back, for “the sea has come up and
drowned all the people on Marae Renga.”
It is on this utterance of Hotu
Matua that J, Macmillan Brown, Chan-
cellor of the Maoriland University, has based
his attempt at solving the riddle of the
Pacific in a work he has just published. No
better authority on Polynesia exists than
this delightfully didactic professor, who
mixes a robust philosophy with painstaking
observation, and who, although nearly 80,
recently spent five months on Easter Island,
reaching it by schooner from Auckland and
being picked up and conveyed to S. America
by a Chilian cruiser in the middle of his
investigations, Macmillan Brown’s theory
is that the mysterious island-graveyard is
the remnant of an archipelago that has dis-
appeared. There is geological evidence of a
great Pacific continent which foundered about
the time the Andes and the Rocky Mountains
emerged. Oceania has shown the _ same
tendency in later centuries; there is an
island in the Pacific which has sunk and
reappeared several times, in its latest avatar
reconveying above the surface traces of occu-
pation which perished in a former subsi-
dence. On the archipelago which is postu-
lated as having existed adjacent to Easter
Island a great neolithic civilisation arose.
The ruling caste were of a Caucasoid race:
their culture had affinities, apparently, with
that of the Children of the Sun, whose
spreading from Egypt in quest of gold and
pearls and other substances with magical
properties is described by Perry and Elliot
Smith. A race of mighty schemers, they
planned Easter Island as their mausoleum.
They had already embarked upon a gran-
diose conception that was. intended to include
the whole island as their mortuary when
ironic Fate plunged them and . their home
beneath the waves and left their miserable
horde of gravediggers with the freedom of
the sepulchre.
The most romantic feature of this obscure
tragedy, which involved a whole race in ruin,
is the practical certainty that Western eyes
gazed without realising it upon the com-
mencement and the conclusion of the
di-ama. Juan Fernandez, the great
Spanish pilot, in avoiding the current
between Callao and Valparaiso in 1576,
sailed south-west into the Pacific, and, after
a month, came across land and the mouths
of very large rivers. “From whence, and from
what the natives intimated, and because they
were people so white and so well-clad, and
in everything so different from those of Chili
and all Peru,” he was convinced he had
reached the coast of the great southern con-
tinent Spanish navigators had long been
dreaming of. Fernandez purposed return-
ing, but died before he could carry out his
plan. Over a hundred years passed before
this land was seen again by Europeans, and
the record was then made by Wafer, an
officer on the Bachelor’s. Delight, Captain
Davis, returning from raids about Panama,
Iri latitude 12deg. 30m. south they had been
buffeted in a terrifying manner. The cause
was the great earthquake of Callao, 1687.
“We came,” says Wafer, “to latitude 27deg.
20m. south.”
About two hours before day we fell in with a low
sandy island and heard a great roaring noise like that
of sea beating upon the shore ahead of the ship. So
we plied off till day and then stood in again with
the land, which proved to be a small flat Island with-
out the guard of any rocks To the westward, about
12 leagues by judgment, we saw a range of high land
which we took to be islands; for there were several
partitions in the prospect. This land seemed to
reach about 14 or 15 leagues in a range, and there
came thence great flocks of fowls. . . .The smiill island
hears from Copaipo almost due east 500 leagues, and
from the Gallapagos under the line 000 leagues.
Dampieb, in bis “Voyages." relates bow Cap-
tain Davis told him of tbis discovery. Tlurty-
five years later Roggeveen, tbe Dutchman,
sailed along tbe latitude in search of Davis s
land, but could not find it. Roggeveen stood
west 12dcg. from long. 25deg. till on April
6, Easter Day. be came across an island
which he called Easter Island. Gonsalez,
a Spaniard, sailed again in 1771 in search
of Davis’s land, and he too found Easter
Island. Beecuey, who visited the rock in
1525, maintains that Davis had found
Easter Island, the strong currents account-
ing for his being carried so far east. In
1909 the ship Guinevere reported a reef m
about 95° long, east and 35° lat. south. This
last laconic observation in a log is all the
information we shall ever be able to record
of the home of the imperial race that reared
the monuments.
FENG-SHUI.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“Migrants” of One Sort and Another.
Australia is now in receipt of an un-
usually mixed lot of “migrants,” as it is the
fashion to call them now, though it is a
doubtful fashion. A migratory bird comes
and goes; the worst of this country’s
arrivals come but don’t go. The non-British
visitants have indisputable passports, and
with rare exceptions they have enough money
to escape rejection as paupers. If some of
them own criminal records these are not
paraded. There is a good and new reason
why there should be a movement of strange
peoples this way, apart from the reason,
which is no longer wholly new, that the
U.S.A. door is not open in the old generous
fashion. The number of countries which
have begun to take strong measures with
the loathsome wild beast of Communism has
increased remarkably. In Esthonia, where,
not long since, the unclean thing came near
to destroying the republic, the tendency is
to make the fact of being an avowed or
proved Communist a sure passport to that
land where all men are equal, or, at least,
equally dead. Roumania recently arrested
a large batch of the breed and held it for
trial, and ejected another large batch —in
other words, gave it its passport. In Britain,
France, Belgium. Germany and Italy a
rather short way is developing as regards the
practical Communist, though the purely theo-
retical one may be tolerated after a fashion.
The way in is barred as much as possible,
and the way out is facilitated, and sometimes
the way to gaol also. The last-named coun-
try not only expels objectionable “migrants
with a facility which would be considered
astonishing in Australia, but it sometimes
moves on its own bad characters. Australia
would naturally suit the exporting Govern-
ment, for it takes the nuisance far away, and
doesn’t send him back. It would naturally
appeal to the exported criminal, for it gives
him far better treatment than Soviet Russia.
In that country the ruling Communist in a
palace may do well; but the lumping Commu-
nist on a wharf is apt to be shot as a counter-
revolutionary when he strikes. Even in
tolerant and democratic Norway the Public
Prosecutor has put sundry Communists on
trial for their lives because they used the
everyday language of their tribe, or, in
other words, they incited to brutal assault,
mutilation, robbery, murder, rape, the reduc-
tion of decent people to beggary and enslave-
ment, all under the general term of revolu-
tion. In Australia that kind of brutish
conspiracy is quite open. Communists, and im-
ported ones at that, have stopped practically
the entire shipping industry of the continent.
In the Commonwealth’s biggest city an-
nouncement was lately made that if a crew
is wanted to take a ship to sea application
must be made to Communist headquarters.
The members of the great and blatant Cam-
orra recently met in conference at the same
city, and not a single arrest was attempted.
The folk whom other countries begin to lock
up or chase off the premises naturally steer
for this haven of refuge, and when enough
of them accumulate here they expect to take
over the haven. So strong has become the
supposed prescriptive right of these people
to our country that the adoption now of a
policy of exclusion and deportation would
probably raise a more noisy racket than a
fairly extensive hanging would do elsewhere,
but that only means that there is a long list
of arrears to catch up.

Second Chambers in Danger.
Supporters of Tasmania’s “House of Lords”
are wondering whether the new Governor
will find a way of rescuing them from the
very tight place they are in in consequence
of thi Premier’s success in ignoring the
“Lords” in the matter of money bills. In
the case of the Appropriation Bill, which
Administrator Nicholes assented to on the
advice of Ministers, utterly ignoring the
amendments of the Council, there was the
excuse that the whole machinery of govern-
ment would be held up' if the Royal Assent
was not forthcoming immediately. The Land
and Income Taxation Bill, which the Assem-
bly has ordered to be presented to the Gov-
ernor in precisely the same terms as the
Appropriation measure, is not a matter of
extreme urgency. It is therefore possible that
Governor O’Grady may persuade his re-
sponsible advisers to recommend him to
submit the whole dispute to the Imperial
authorities for a definite ruling. There will
be no definite ruling, of. course, unless a
special session of the dying Parliament is
called to arrange a joint address of both
Houses praying the British _ authorities to
decide the constitutional point as to the
Council’s right to amend money bills, but the
reference to London will give the allegedly
diplomatic Governor O’ Grady a few months’
breathing time. Meanwhile the trouble may
settle itself somehow or other. It may, for
example, get itself settled at the forthcoming
election, which may provide the Governor
with a new set of advisers. If, on the other
hand, as at present seems more likely, the
Governor hears from England the 1 familiar
message that he must do as his Ministers
tell him, or find other Ministers, then Leg.
Councils may as well put up the shutters.
The maintenance of a second Chamber which
can be over-ridden by the Ministry, or even
by a majority in the other House, is absurd.
Equally absurd is it to maintain a Chamber
which deserves to be liable to be over-ridden.
There never was a time when second cham-
bers were so badly needed: there never was
a time when their complete disappearance
was in such danger, and all through the
neglect of Governments, and especially
National Governments, to reform them. The
stupidity of these bodies in the matter tias
been almost beyond belief.

Siberia and North Australia.
“Feng-Shui”: “G.D.M.’s” “novel idea” (B.
1/1 /’25) that Japan will never covet this
country while she has Siberia close at hand
to occupy comes to grief on examination.
The Japanese High Command has made
two very resolute and large-scale attempts
to carry the idea of occupying Siberia
into practice. Twenty years ago, when the
brown men were chasing the whites out of
Manchuria, the newspapers of the island
empire were full of such hopeful urges as
the following:—
With the strong position that we must have in
Manchuria, it will he easy for us to take, or at
least to govern, China at need. We shall he able,
moreover, to go still further, and to penetrate
Siberia. In the present war it will be sufficient
to go as far as Lake Baikal, but in the next war
Japan must plant her flag on the Urals, and our
troops must water their horses at the Volga.
The opposition of three European Powers
prevented the Japanese military party —
which, by the way, despite the Parliamentary
make-believe that has been given such pro-
minence in the cables recently, is still the
real Government —from realising its ambition
at that time, but in the next war, which
was the Great War, the plan was put into
operation again. That was when the Rus-
sian resistance to Germany collapsed and
the Allies and Japan intervened in Siberia
to prevent , German influence spreading to
the East. In 1920 the danger no longer
existed, and the Allies withdrew. Not so the
Japanese. They continued to struggle for
the control of Eastern Siberia for two years
more. The dream of planting the emblem of
the Rising Sun on the Urals still persisted,
and cost the ambitious country over 1000
lives and 600 million yen. November, 1922,
saw the last Japanese soldier leave Vladi-
vostock. During the occupation desperate
efforts had been made behind the lines to
settle the invaded territory by Japanese.
These efforts failed, just as the peaceful pene-
tration of Korea and Manchuria has failed
as an outlet for the crowded population of
the home country. Since 1910, when Korea
was annexed, every encouragement has been
offered by the Government to tempt its
nationals across the narrow straits, but after
15 years the Japanese colonists number less
than 400,000, while in the same time the
population of the homeland has increased by
over 10 millions. Like the British in India,
the Japanese goes to his colonies as an ad-
ministrator, and the Chinaman moves in to
reap where the other has sown. Again as all
history shows, race movements tend towards
the sun, and not away from it; and the
working of this curious law is freely illus-
trated by the Jap even in his own
archipelago. The great northern island of
Hokkaido, which is a third the size of
the mainland of Honsiu, contains only about
a fourteenth of the total population, although
its colonisation has been subsidised for
years. “G.D.M.” is justified in his enthusi-
asm over the fertility of Siberia. The pre-
sent writer has seen the pageant of its
springtime from Vladivostok to the Urals.
But it has an ii'on winter, and it will not
grow rice, which is the staple crop of the
Japanese and their staff of life. The men
of Nippon would be more at home in the
Philippines and Java than in Siberia, but
those lands are occupied. The only territory
which provides the three requisites of being
empty, warm and suitable for rice-growing
is the northern portion of this continent.
In fine, Siberia will not lay the bogey that
burdens “G.D.M.’s” unhappy slumbers, but
effective occupation of North Australia by
white settlers would help towards that im-
portant consummation.
Madness and Six Millions.
The Victorian 4f per cent, loan of £6,000,600,
issued at £97 10s., wasn’t a failure, for a loan
that has been underwritten can’t really fail,
but as the underwriters were left with 90 per
cent, on their hands, it was no dazzling suc-
cess. The interest rate was low, the amount
was large, and the shock was considerable.
J. Bull had an idea that the promise to bor-
row, for a time, only enough in London to
meet commitments meant borrowing for re-
newal purposes alone. He finds, with sur-
prise and grumpiness, that it means borrow-
ing to meet renewals, to cover the London
interest bill, and to pay for odd purchases.
The rotten and bankrupt fact that such in-
terest on old debts as has to be met in gold
is now paid, not out of revenue, but out of
new borrowings, has become so obvious that
it isn’t worth an attempt at disguise. From
the end of 1919 to the end of 1924 exports
haven’t even met the cost of imports, and
there has been nothing save new foreign
loans to pay the interest on old foreign loans
with. When the new loan is floated in Lon-
don, the proceeds stay in London, save a
trifle which may arrive here as goods to the
damage of local industry, but a correspond-
ing amount, paid for with paper here, is
called loan expenditure instead of ordinary
expenditure to disguise the situation. Some-
times it is called expenditure on loan
“works,” but mighty few of these pay for
the loan, and an increasing number are not
works at all. The purchase of Smith’s
land at a boom price, and the planting there-
on of inexperienced Brown or imported
Jones, with an impossible, mortgage, only a
trifle of which will ever be collected from
him or anybody else, certainly isn’t a “work,”
yet this sort of thing represents more than
one-fifth of the security for Victoria’s total
public debt nowadays. Victoria has less
need to buy immigrants regardless of cost
than any of its neighbors, because it is the
most densely peopled section already. No
less than 14 States out of the 48 which make
up the great G. Washington Republic are
not so densely settled as Victoria —to
wit, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado,
New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Oregon,
North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska,
Texas and Florida, and the last two date
their history back 300 years or so. Even
old Maine, where Pilgrim Fathers froze
under Charles 1., is only a little more popu-
lous. The Allan-P’eacock province has less
public land to put settlers on than any other
part of the mainland, and what remains is
mostly public rock. Its private lands are
ruinously expensive to resume by reason of
the comparative density of population.
No other State, save isolated Tasmania, is
less in need of new people for defence pur-
poses, and immigration should be diverted, as
far as possible, from it to regions where a
real need exists. Victoria requires a better-
diffused population, but it can get along with
its natural increase and with such persons
as happen along. It would even have been
a good thing if a lot of its returned soldiers
had been induced to take up the thread of
existence again in other States, where there
is more available land and less mortgage.
Why Victoria, being more than twice _ as
thickly inhabited as its most inhabited neigh-
bor, should abandon decency, honesty, sol-
vency, sanity and sobriety, and blew as much
loan money as all its neighbors combined in
ti’ving to buy more inhabitants, even if they
don’t stay, passes imagination. The freeze
of the £6.000.000 may mean that it begins
to pass Bull’s imagination also.

Australian Hardwoods.
From a humpy in Jarrahland: —
I agree in the main with the writer who discussed
the marketing of Australian timbers (B, 11/12/’24).
There is no doubt in my mind that many of our
hardwoods might be used extensively for joinery,
cabinet work and the like. One reason why they
are not so used is that our timbers are not graded
for defects. It is a misuse of language to call
“first-class” and “second-class” (the designations
employed in our sawmilling industry) grades. Again,
except in rare cases, it is not the custom to hold
seasoned stocks of our woods, and you must have
thoroughly seasoned timber for fine work. In America,
thanks chiefly to Westralia’s old acquaintance
Hoover, now U.S. Secretary of Commerce, a uniform
set of grading rules is in force. Every stick
of timber cut is placed in one of nine grades,
ranging from Grade-A boards, warranted free from
blemish, down to No. 5 Common. No. 5 Common
is defined as “the recognised lowest grade; it
admits of all defects known in lumber, provided the
piece is strong enough to hold together when care-
fully handled.” Thus the user of American timber
knows exactly what he is going to get from the
otuer party to the contract. The user of Australian
timber, on the other hand, has to pay either a
high price for selected timber or a lower price for
so-called second-class stuff which may include the
refuse of the mill —No. 5 Common and worse.
A selection of Westralian hardwoods was shown
at Wembley. The jarrah exhibit made such an
impression that a dispassionate Yankee expert, writ-
ing in the leading U.S. trade paper, adjudged
jarrah to be one of the world’s three coming timbers
for cabinet and general-utility use. Yet in Perth
at the present time it would be a difficult matter to
buy a few hundred feet of, say, 12 in. x lin. seasoned
jarrah, although the jarrah people would offer
you any quantity of green sleepers, bridge timber.-;,
waggon scantling, etc., guaranteed free from blemish.
In Victoria and Tasmania the position is somewhat
different. There the mills are mostly run by men
not financially strong enough to stack their timber
for a couple of years in order to supply seasoned
timber. In effect, the big millers won’t eater
for this trade and the little men can’t. There is
something radically wrong when the motor-body
industry alone imports millions of feet in the course
of a year. Timbers well adapted for this use are
milled in Australia, but they are marketed in an
unsuitable condition, namely, green. The logical
remedy is scientific kiln-drying, or a combination
of air-seasoning and kiln-drying. In fact, the
position with regard to our native timbers is not
going to be bettered until we have proper seasoning
and grading methods, together with regulation of
export until local requirements, particularly of
seasoned timber, are filled —a matter for the different
Forestry Departments.

The Petted Moron.
Dear Bulletin, —A certain class of person
has three convictions to help him on his
steep and stony way: (1) That the colored
man is always right as against the white
man; (2) that any other nation or race is
always right as against our own; (3) that
any violent criminal, provided he isn’t a
king or an aristocrat, is either a much mis-
understood person or an irresponsible mental
invalid and an object of pity. Of these,
mayhap, is “M.G.5.,” with his “Plea for
Public Executions” (B. 25/12/’24). He
says:—
Hanging never has deterred people from murder....
The persistence of the custom of hanging has a much
wider significance. The average citizen feels his real
justification for the act lies in the sense of relief
he experiences when he reads in the paper that
somebody has been hanged. As long as he is un-
easily aware of his own sub-conscious predilection
for violence he will continue to sanction a little
killing as a social purge—even when science has
proved conclusively that the victims are morons who
are no more responsible for their actions than little
children.
The position, apparently, is that every mur-
derer is a moron, and, therefore, exempt
from punishment on the ground of complete
irresponsibility. In fact, when a body is
found it is hardly worth while looking for
the criminal, since the mangled remains
prove that he is a misunderstood child of
misfortune. “Science,” which is a fine large
term, much used by Domain orators, has
“proved” this, just as the Royal Society, a
very learned body, once “proved” that Hell
is situated in the centre of the earth. At
least, it was unanimous about the matter,
which was much the same thing. Therefore
it seems advisable for every criminal to com-
mence with a murder, and qualify for his
certificate of irresponsibility. Should he get
into dreadful trouble over a bogus bank in
the autumn of his life he can produce the
stuffed remains of the victim whom he stored
up during a farseeing youth, and secure
sympathetic treatment, instead of rough
penal servitude. Not only does it appear
that every person who earns the death
penalty is a moron, but every “average
citizen” is a moron also, and is “uneasily
aware” that he may break out at any
moment. I haven’t that feeling, so I am
not a moron, but the profound understand-
ing of the inward sensation shown by
“M.G.S.” makes me alarmed about his con-
dition. It has been a common idea that
when (to quote a random example) that
notorious moron, Burke, of the firm of
Burke and Hare, was put beyond all pos-
sibility of resuming practice, the “average
citizen” of Edinburgh didn’t heave a sigh
of relief because he knew that he was also
liable at any moment to suffocate people and
sell their bodies for dissection, but because
he had lived in dreadful fear of being a mys-
terious disappearance himself. And when
Ned Kelly passed out it has been supposed
that the local feeling of relief did not arise
because all the local inhabitants were natural
bushrangers and loved to know that a brother
had been scragged, but because the cause of
terror had gone where he couldn’t possibly
escape and resume practice. It would seem,
on the authority of “M.G.5.,” that these
ideas are all astray. “Hanging never has
deterred people from murder” except in the
sense that hanged people commit no more
murders. They don’t even slay a fellow-
prisoner or a gaol-warder. In that respect
hanging is more successful than fine or im-
prisonment, which, I suppose, “M.G.S.”
would also make an end of because of their
futility. Doubtless capital punishment
brutalises the executioner, but there is a
hardening effect, and probably an equally
bad one, in being a gaol-warder, especially
among long-sentence prisoners, and nobody
lias supervised a mob of lunatics for long
and preserved his finer feelings intact. Even
being a policeman in a slum district, or kill-
ing unoffending and often terrified animals
for daily food, makes men callous. A certain
type of philanthropist gets a pass to witness
an execution, and then writes up the con-
densed episode, which only lasts a few
minutes, with pious and conventional horror.
If he was offered a pass to witness a life-
sentence, particularly one passed on a young
man, or even a ten-year sentence, I sup-
pose he would refuse it with the trivial eva-
sion that he couldn’t spare the time. And
very likelv he would recoil with horror if
offered a front seat at a brutal murder, the
terrified victim being taken unawares and
done to death, amid frenzied struggles, with
a hatchet, even if the offer was made . so
that he could see and appreciate both sides
of the case, and have his maudlin emotions
stirred both ways, instead of only one way.
I think that, on certain stated occasions,
one moron should be allowed to perpetrate
the very unpleasant murder of a victim
fetched in from the street at random, and
another to commit assault and. “grievous
bodily,” and another to beat his wife or
the lady who passes as such, all this in an
amphitheatre before a great assemblage of
humanitarians who would be chained down
to prevent interference. It might apprise
them of the fact that there are other people
besides their nominal “morons” to be con-
sidered.—Yours, etc., Professional Homi-
cide.

Greater Brisbane.
Greater Brisbane is to elect its first Mayor
and Corporation in February and set to
work towards tlie end of tlie year. It will
be one city, whereas Greater Melbourne is
a name covering 20 alleged “cities” and some
oddments, and Greater Sydney is an agglom-
eration of 40-odd municipalities. Greater
Brisbane reckons itself the most extensive
city in Australia, if not in the Empire. It
covers 385 square miles. The Mayor of this
territory is to keep honest on £lOOO per
annum and expenses. The 20 aldermen are
to resist temptation on £4OO each. Aldermen
are to represent separate wards, but his
Washup will be elected, like a Senate, by
the whole place voting as one constituency.
The Council hopes to attend to
The provision, construction, maintenance, manage-
ment, control and regulation of the use of roads,
bridges, tunnels, ferries, subways and other means
of communication.
Public parks, aviation grounds, recreation grounds
and other public places, reserves and lands vested
in it, markets, baths and bathing-places, tramways,
motor-omnibuses and other means of public trans-
portation, traffic.
Public health, sanitation, cleansing and scavenging,
prevention and suppression of infectious and other
diseases, sewerage, drainage, the removal, suppression
and abatement of nuisances and noxious trades.
Abattoirs and milk supply, supply of water, light
and power, disposal of the dead, subdivision of
land and use and occupation of land, buildings and
the use and occupation of buildings, protection from
fire, boundaries and fences, the opening, closing,
aligning, widening, altering and grading of roads,
the eradication of noxious weeds and pests, also
pounds and impounding.
The accounts of the city, and, in a general way,
all works, matters and things that, in the Council’s
opinion, are necessary or conducive to the good gov-
ernment of the city and the well-being of its
inhabitants.
The experiment will be full of interest, for
it looks like almost tlie biggest shifting of
responsibility on record. However, the case
is mitigated by the fact that the Assembly
and the Governor-in-Council retain a right
of veto over the ordinances of the new
institution. So if it goes mad with too much
responsibility, and begins to dispose of the
dead by throwing them in the river, a court
of appeal will not be wholly wanting.
♦
Preference to Unionists.
“Bildad” considers preference on the way to
the races:—
I note with pleasure that there is a growing demand
for a Royal Commission garmented with the most
extensive powers to inquire into the concession of
preference to unionists, and all the side-issues of
the case. It should call before it leading union offi-
cials and the like, and find out if the preference is
because the unionist is guaranteed by examination,
like a qualified doctor, to be able to give better
service than a quack or outsider; or because his
service is more regular (i.e., less disturbed by irri-
tating stoppages) than a non-unionist’s would be;
or because he is more beautiful, or more moral, or
more charitable, or cheaper, or pays more taxes,
or is a more patriotic citizen and more eager than
other men to rush to his country’s defence on a
day of peril. Failing satisfactory evidence in any
of these directions, the Commission would naturally
try to find out if the general mass of union privilege
isn’t exactly in the same category as monarchical
privilege, and the privilege of a landed aristocracy,
and that of an Established Church- —merely the arro-
gance of a caste which has “arrived,” and assimi-
lated, under favoring circumstances, the idea of its
self-evident divine right.
James 1., who was an amusing circumstance in his
day, expounded his somewhat similar position to
his first and flabbergasted Parliament in this wise:—
The state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon
earth, for kings are not only God’s lieutenants upon
earth and sit upon God’s throne, but even by Goa
himself they are called gods.
There wasn’t much evidence in that, but there was
plenty of assertion, and the “state” of unionism,
which tries to take over the job once attempted by
the “state” of monarchy, is also assertive, though
not evidential. Matters about which further details
would not be out of place include the holding of
private courts, the imposition of taxes and fines
which the common law is often called on to collect,
the passing of sentences of excommunication with the
right to destroy the business of any person who
doesn’t enforce the sentence by a rigid boycott of the
excommunicated, and finally a large but vague claim
to be above the general law in strike time, and the
arbitration law T at all times. If a definition of these
claims, and some kind of explanation as to whether
they are divine rights which dropped from Heaven,
or special privileges acquired in return for special
services, or plain grabs—if, I say, these could be
extracted and put on record, it might not do much
good, but the volume would be handy for reference.
And valuable evidence might be evoked concerning
the alleged sanctity of the day variety of “wage
slavery,” as compared with any other variety which
may yield more money. Of course, it is easy to say
that day “slavery” is the policy of unionism, and
is enforced by fine, industrial excommunication, fierce
language and even personal violence; but the real
questions are: Why is it the policy, and who made
it so, and who profits by it? It is easy to declare
that the person who calls the day-wage “slavery”
fetich in question is a scab and a blackleg; but
that only moves the problem a stage further
back. Some time ago a Moulders’ Union
fined a member heavily, and, so far as it was able
to do so, deprived him and his family of their means
of livelihood, for earning more than was permitted.
It said he was a heretic who had lost his soul, but
it didn’t explain how. More recently 1000 Victorian
railway workers were got together, and as no one
dared to be the first protestant, each called down
the wrath of the industrial gods on his own head, and
on the heads of his 999 mates, and admitted that
he ought to be industrially cut off if he accepted
any extra money, no matter how well he had earned
it. It is all a grotesque parody on Australia’s
national sport, for in racing the big prize goes to
the horse that speeds up most, and the horse and
jockey and owner and trainer that go slow on pur-
pose are disqualified, and instead of all the animals
running for a day wage the honest but inefficient
steed gets nothing.
“Der Joxg" : Natal lias just involved her-

against the ordinance, and, failing that, to
conduct a passive-resistance campaign

growth of Indian parasitism in South and

cation in being able to say that he banned

The “loyalists” on the Sydney wharves
were the men who came to • the rescue
when the Waterside Workers’ Federation
tried to hold up not only troopships but
hospital ships. They have been sacrificed.
The Shipping Bureau men represented the
principle of preference to returned soldiers.
They are in process of being sacrificed to
buy peace from the Bolshevik element which
will give no peace, but they are offered a
chance to join up with the union, where
p. warm reception is ready for them. A good
while ago an overture was made in public
on behalf of the bureau men to the effect
that they were willing to abandon their
preference as returned soldiers and merge
into the wliarf-laboring crowd provided a
roster was established and every man em-
ployed in turn, instead of a consistent pre-
ference being given to the “bulls” whose votes
keep the officials in their positions. The
speaker received his answer on the spot, its
tenor being: "We won’t have any blanky
roster. Throw that man out.” To rely on
the law when it is represented by men of
the stamp of Fuller and Bruce is rather
like serving Charles I. in other days.
Charles had a habit of abandoning his
friends to mollify his enemies. The latter
became so pleased that they ended by cut-
ting oif his stupid and futile head.

“Griffith Moses” : That most unsatis-
factory political Labor estate-agent, ex-
Treasurer Lang of N.S.W.. closed the old
year with a piece in the Sydney press, in
which he passionately declared that Laborites
and Communists have nothing in common,
and expressed surprise “that so insignificant
a body” as the latter “should receive so much
prominence in the public press.” I have
also experienced surprise very often that so
insignificant a body as Mr. Lang should be
allowed so much space and advertisement in
the public, or at least the “capitalistic,”
press. If his utterances were confined to his
own party papers his political extinction
might be hastened. But this line of reason-
ing doesn’t apply to the Communists. Thar
organisation may not be officially connected
with Labor, though it contrived to take
charge of more than one Labor conference,
and hoisted its Red Flag and Red Objective
very high. But it has engineered a strike
which has almost stopped White Australian
shipping; it has set Australian law and
Australian union officials at defiance; and it
has intimated in Australia’s biggest city that
crews will only be supplied on application to
Communist headquarters and on strict Com-
munist conditions, if supplied at all. The
connection between the men who run strikes
here and the men who make them in Moscow
is so close that, according to the lately-
returned Marks, M.11.R., lie learned of the
coming upheaval from Russian Communistic
sources in Europe before the signs of it were
visible here. But even the brightest sea
has a dead fly in it somewhere, and probably
the Communist leaders regret as much as
Labor estate-agent Lang that they “receive
so much prominence in the public press.”
When (if ever) it is a matter of announcing
their success, prominence will be more than
welcome, but it is an accursed thing while it
consists in the publication of most unpleasant
warnings about the size and progress of their
conspiracy.

A ghost which refuses to be laid is the story
of two white women, allegedly castaways
from the vanished Douglas Mawson, held
captive among the blacks in the wildest corner
of the depopulated Northern Territory. A
matter which was emphasised after the poor,
barren search that was made was that the
Great North isn’t supplied with even one
oil vessel-of-war of a few tons burden, light
enough to poke into the nooks and crannies
of these tangled waters, and fast enough to
overhaul native canoes as they dodge from
isle to isle, and to inquire if they happen to be
carrying two white women, painted black, to
a fresh place of concealment. And there is
great shortage of material for amateur re-
search. It was urged on Minister Pearce,
who is the Bismarck of that branch of the
Government, that an offer of a reward should
be circulated for the return of the two cap-
tives, supposing they exist, it being a fair
chance that some colored or half-colored
brother, with a knowledge of money values,
might take a risk. The extraordinary atti-
tude of the Department was that it wouldn’t
offer a reward because there was no chance
of losing the money, there being, in its posi-
tive opinion, no women in the case at all. It
wouldn’t back its opinion, and it wouldn’t
bet on an alleged certainty. A Department
like that is quaint and original.

“Sol. Malaprop” : The Italian has appa-
rently come into fashion for a time, like a
new thing in hats, and some daily papers
boom him greatly as the man (and woman)
for the North. He may prove so on longer
trial, or he may not. Even in The Bulle-
tin Vance Palmer gives our Italian immi-
grants the glad roar (25/'.12/’24), and waxes
scornful about those “who are infatuated
with stupid German-American theories about
the superior virtues of the Nordic race.”
Certainly I have a good opinion of the
Italians, especially those of the northern
provinces, where the influx and settlement of
the Nordic Lombards from what is now
Prussia, after Rome gave up the ghost, in-
troduced fair hair and new influences. It
was the North which produced the men who
made United Italy, and when Italy, alone
among West-European countries, went Bol-
shevik, and when the Government at Rome
went over to the cause of the destruction of
civilisation and Bolshed also, it was a north-
ern man who saved the situation. Whether
the Italians, including those in Australia,
will ever Bolsh again I don’t pretend to
say. I am no great scientist, but I have a
respect for Marconi, the gentleman of half-
Irish parentage, who also came from a city
of North Italy. There are doubts about
him being the originator of wireless tele-
graphy, just as there are about Edison in-
venting electricity, but he did much for it,
and rescued Italy from the suspicion of hav-
ing lost the knack of invention. In the
United States, where there were 1,300,000
imported Italians in 1910 and 1,600,000 in
1920, besides a vast number locally born,
there is, Mr. Palmer says, a stupid or in-
fatuated theory about the Nordic races being
a better crowd. There is certainly a theory,
and a very heated one, and the U.S. has some
experience to go on. The Italian never
seemed to be in the same street, in an agri-
cultural sense, as the Dane and the Dutch-
man, who have worked miracles with two
most unpromising lands. He lost the colonis-
ing knack before the Spaniards, Portuguese,
French and British acquired it, but lie is
a frequent and chatty inmate of other
people’s colonies, which he occasionally en-
riches with politicians of the Lazzarini type.
He is moderately popular in places, but no-
thing to shout about. The position, perhaps,
is that he and the other Mediterranean char-
acters have a past, while the Nordic peoples
have a future.

“Ria” : “Stellsby” is right about the popu-
lar tendency to regard the limbless man as
the war victim most entitled to sympathy
(B. 25/12/’24). The reason, of course, is
that a limbless man’s loss is obvious to all,
while the spine cases, t.b.’s and mental cases
are shut away from the public gaze in vari-
ous hospitals and sanatoria. The Repatria-
tion Department treats limbless men more
generously than us t.b.’s. The limbless man
is put on a pension, graded according to his
loss, for life, and not subject to alteration.
It is otherwise with the t.b. I came back
as a t.b. case, and after “enjoying” a pension
for about 12 months I was brought up for a
review and my pension discontinued. Un-
able to work, I appealed and. after six
months, was put on 7s. 6d. a week. This is
not a life pension : at first I had to present
myseit for medical examination every three
months—it is every six months now. The
strain and uncertainty of this periodical re-
view cause the average t.b. case worry that
should be spared him. A lung once diseased
is never the same again. Even a t.b. who
is fortunate enough to have had his disease
arrested must always be on guard against
stirring the quiescent germs into activity
once more.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The British Government’s suggestion that
the Dominion Prime Ministers should visit
London in March to discuss the Geneva Pro-
tocol has been bleakly received. All three
S’African parties are against the Protocol.
Canada’s attitude is almost as icy as that ot
the U.S.A. itself. Massey has said that the
White Maori land policy is more to him than
a thousand Protocols, or words to that ell cot.
The Australian Prime Minister is waiting to
consult Groom, his Attorney-General, who is
expected to reach Melbourne any day if the
Seamen’s Union doesn’t declare him “black.
But neither Groom nor Charlton nor any other
Geneva delegate, Australian or foreign, can dis-
pel the doubt as to whether acceptance of the
Protocol wouldn’t result in the Immigration
Restriction Act or some such measure being
challenged by an aggrieved nation in a Euro-
pean assembly or court. . In common pru-
dencc Australia ought to give itself the bene-
fit of the doubt.
British Labor of the Macdonald and Jack
Jones sort is so full of love for its brother
Trotsky that there is little room for any-
thing else. Wherefore one Jack Scurr, M. 1.,
moved in the Commons the other day for the
removal of all restrictions on alien immi-
grants. When so many doors are closed or
closing Scurr desired to open that of over-
populated Britain wide, so that all the mov-
able cheap labor going could pour in and
take his already-distressed countryman’s job.
“Solomon M.”: The Bulletin recently
made a justifiable comment on the money-
making device suggested by these words in
the advt. of the Standard Portland Cement
Co.: —
Even before cement is produced, the township
subdivision should show sufficient profit to pay a
dividend.
Still it shows that the way to make a town-
ship is to set up a new manufacturing in-
dustry, and not simply to “put people on
the land.”
There will shortly be a vacancy on the
Queensland Supreme Court Bench, and it
is expected that the Labor caucus will
appoint the bellicose pacifist Brennan, who
is Minister of Public Instruction. Not be-
cause Brennan is the best man that could
be got—there are dozens of Queenslanders
with superior qualifications—but because he
is a Valued Member of Our Party who is
believed to want the job, and because num-
erous other Valued Members are known to
want his job. It is felt as a grievance in
trade-union circles that the field of selec-
tion is limited to practitioners of the court.
Perhaps the disability will be removed before
the next vacancy occurs, and then there
may be a Justice Burke, of the Seamen’s
Union, or a Justice Dunstan, of the A.W.U.
Although the Uppah Chambali blocked him
from getting half of the extra income-tax he
asked for, Alec Peacock, the Victorian
Treasurer, will take care that he has no de-
ficit on June 30. On December 31 he had
£475 (XX) more revenue than for the first six
months of 1923-24. With that much to the
good, with all the direct taxes to collect, and
with six months to apply the shears on cur-
tailable outlay, he should be able to balance
the ledger.
The Westralian Treasurer reports that the
sky is brighter, and that it will be possible
to finish up next June “within the estimated
deficit of £188,000.” This will be the 14th
consecutive shortage, making the complete
deficit well over six millions. Low tax-
ation —invariably almost the lowest in the
Commonwealth —has been the one and only
cause. And all the while the weeps of the
Golden State about its special wrongs and
its cries for alms from the common fund have
been dreadful to listen to.
The position in Sydney at the week-end
was that the Communist gang had taken pos-
session of the shipping industry, declaring
the Communist Hall the only place for the
supply of crews, and the Communist officials
the suppliers—or deniers. Wherefore an
obvious course is for the Bruce-Page Govern-
ment, if it lacks the courage to deport the
foreign leaders of Communism, at least to
resume the hall for improvement pur-
poses in the ordinary way, leaving the value
to be fixed by arbitration at the ordinary
pace. It is a mouldy structure, anyhow.
In a measure passed by the S. Aus. Assem-
bly last session the Fountain of Honor was
asked not to spray any more South Austra-
lians unless a specific request was made by
both Houses. The measure was thrown out
by the Leg. Council. Now Dave Gordon,
one of those who threw it out, has been
knighted on the recommendation of the Com-
monwealth Government; and Attorney-
General Denny, who fathered the bill, hints
that the Assembly will be asked to make a
terrific protest when it returns to its job.
Still hard words are not likely to disturb
the complacency of a Government which
knows that it can count on the support of
every pony-racecourse proprietor and pitcher-
showman who wants a handle to his name.
THE DEADLY PARALLEL.
“Reports from Moscow state that Trotsky is now a prisoner in consequence of his criticisms of
Bolshevist administration.”
PRISONER: “Remember, I’m the Danton of our glorious revolution.”
RED SOLDIER: “Well, you’re only going to get what Danton got.”
There was no frill about the ceremony at
Vic. Executive Council Chamber when
Speaker Bowser presented the Appropriation
Bill to Stradbroke for assent. Gowns, wigs
and mace were left at Parliament House, and
no car or horse-drawn vehicle brought
Speaker or clerks to the Chief Sec.’s building
in Spring-street. They came on foot. It
was enough to make Whiskers Jenkins rise
from his grave and protest against things not
being done “properly.”
Even Russia, according to accounts from
Moscow, went a-Christmazeing according to
its means. Vodka was abundant for all who
could raise the price of a drink, the Govern-
ment having abandoned Prohibition and gone
back to the old source of revenue —and obli-
vion. The new Communistic rich fared sump-
tuously. The vast mass of Communistic poor
got through somehow, or else didn’t get
through. A number made pilgrimages to
Lenin’s last resting-place, but found the
door too hot, and came away. Trotsky, like
many others, spent the day in gaol, where ne
is awaiting trial, or “death from natural
causes,” or something. When he was pushed
out of the Ministry he retired to the Crimea
in the extreme south, where he possibly hoped,
at the worst, to retreat by water if there was
any place in the wide world that would take
him in, and there he was arrested between
two old acquaintances, the Devil and the deep
sea.
A. W. Buckley, of ballot-box notoriety,
was succeeded as general secretary of the
N.S.W. Railwaymen’s Union by a shop
steward from England, name of Chapman.
The Communists of the Labor Council ap-
plauded the selection loudly, and the new
arrival has justified their expectations by
demanding a 30-hour week in the Govern-
ment railway service, by cheering on his
fellow-importations of the waterfront war,
and by contributing Communist stuff to the
Labor Daily. Now comes the report that
there is to be an irritation strike on the
N. S. Wales railways if the oracle can be
worked, and it is expected that “the blow
will be timed to catch the heavy Easter
traffic, when it will be more effective.” In
order that Australia may not be entirely
deprived of coastal shipping, even the meek
Bruce-Page Government talks of suspending
the coasting-trade clauses of the Navigation
Act. If to that proceeding is .added the
early passage of a deportation law to provide
for cases like those of Walsh, Chapman and
Garden, Australia will get some peace.
In Melbourne people begin to say that a
dozen burglaries per week-end are too many,
especially when the burglars begin to take
down the outer walls of premises to facilitate
operations. Almost every place has been
broken into now except the gaol. The other
day the police secured 15 convictions against
one housebreaking practitioner, and when the
Judge made it six months for the lot they
said it was hardly worth their while to bother
about capturing’ anybody. About the same
time a Bill Sikes with many previous convic-
tions tried robbery from the person, and then,
becoming excited., got the other party down
and jumped on his face. Bill received three
months (the foolish law allowed no more),
and in blank amaze lie asked his Washup if
he couldn’t make it a fine instead. The idea
of disqualifying Bill as a voter and possible
member wasn’t mentioned.
In Westralia, as elsewhere, the Leg. Council
has offended the Government grievously by
heaving out and otherwise maltreating
measures on which the party in office had set
its heart. For the defence it is stated that
some of the measures in question were rushed
into the Council too late for proper considera-
tion, that others were sent up in the hope that
they would be mangled (an old device of
Westralian Labor Ministries), and that the
Government, being the choice of a minority of
the electors, had no mandate for out-and-out
proposals, anyhow. The last point could be
determined before next session by getting the
people to vote on the rejected programme,
and if the verdict went against the Council
that body would have to climb down or risk
destruction. But, for some reason or other,
the Labor party has lost its former enthusi-
asm for the referendum. As regards another
count of the indictment, any second Chamber,
whether Senate, property or nominee House,
has a right to revolt against the prac-
tice, now universal in Australia, of crowding
it with ill-considered bills in the last week
of a session of which a good lialf_ has. been
wasted in idle chatter. Hasty legislation is
nearly always nasty legislation.
From “Karl Narx” :—•
My brethren of the Communist party have just
filed their log for the coming N.S.W. election.
Representatives of the. Cause will advocate a mini-
mum wage of six pounds a week for all workers and
non-workers, without distinction of age or sex. Hours
of labor are to be 30 per week, leaving one clear
day for the ponies and another for Domain oratory.
Motherhood endowment is also on the platform,
and children are to be supported by the
State until they reach the “earning age.”
Hirelings of capitalism are asking whether this
earning age won’t be fixed at 100, and whether any-
one will condescend to work when he (and she) can
get the £6 a week without soiling the hands with
toil. Plutocratic arithmeticians are also pointing
out that there are four million Australians aged 18
and upwards, and that the annual production of
wealth since the war has averaged £305,500,000,
which amount, if it could be divided equally among
the four million, would be only sufficient to provide
a wage of 35 bob per head per week, instead of
six quid. Still, we can deal with these trifling
difficulties when we come to them.
J. P. Jones, Labor leader in the Victorian
House of Landlords, has declined to give up
bis safe suburban seat to nominate for the
Fitzroy pre-selection. Beckett, Mayor of
Fitzroy, who was one of the Upper House
honoraries under Prendergast, is willing, but
seemingly he thinks that other comrades
with designs on the seat should get out of
the way. That’s just what they won’t do,
and it would mean a loss of prestige if ex-
Minister Beckett, M.L.C., were licked by,
say, Torchy Calwell, the Treasury clerk,
whose lightning-like energy dazzles youthful
electors of both sexes. The bird-in-the-hand
principle may therefore appeal to Beckett.
Referring to the political Communists,
but avoiding all mention of the Walshes and
Johansens of the waterfront war, Lang, the
N. S. Wales Labor leader, said this last
week: —
There is really nothing in common between the
Communists and the Labor party, and I utterly
repudiate them [i.e., the Communists], lock, stock
and barrel.
It recalls that Hughes “repudiated” the same
gentry in 1916. In his quaint phrase he
“cast them out like devils out of . swine.”
But Hughes himself was cast out in 1917,
whereas an I.W.W. spouter who received a
long stretch has been re-admitted to the
Labor party “with continuity of member-
ship” and looks like getting a Labor nomina-
tion for the Senate. When he and his friends
get control of the movement they may
“utterly repudiate” Lang.
When Hugh McKenzie was member for Rod-
ney (Vic.) he made a bid for the State Pre-
miership in 1915, but finally accepted office
under Peacock. Had he been as persistent
as his successor, John Allan, he would pro-
bably have got the top job and had Pea-
cock as his second in command. McKenzie
went down at the 1917 election —the battle
which went against Peacock and caused him
to throw in the towel and make room for
Bowser. Had anybody suggested when
John Allan beat McKenzie that Peacock
would be John’s lieutenant in a Cabinet
seven years afterwards he would have been
laughed at. In politics, as in poverty, you
meet, and have to put up with, some strange
bedfellows.
Though it was convicted of a gross mis-
representation in quoting an irresponsible
correspondent’s story as a statement of fact
by the Minister for Home and Territories,
the English Socialist Review continues its
attacks on the Australian administration of
what used to be German New Guinea. Re-
plying to a letter from Attorney-General
Groom, the paper twists some of Groom’s
statements into admissions “that natives
were beaten and that irregularities, to put it
mildly, existed,” and goes on to say that the
case is “evidently one for an independent in-
quiry, as the Australian Government can be
deceived.” Previously, it had accused the
Government of collusion in the alleged
atrocities. It is an interesting illustration
of the readiness of a certain type of Eng-
lishman (and Australian) to defame this
country in the interest of the Hun.

“W’y, the old blankard bit me for three bob,”
said Bill heatedly. “I wouldn’t have minded

ten si o n current,
bursting through
its faulty insula-
tion and contacting
with the wet leaves
of the tree, had
found the earth
through their
bodies and fused
their passionate
embrace in death.
This was to have made the final paragraph
of my next novel, but in view of the possi-
bility of the occurrence in actuality, I give
it to the world how.
“The Dip”: The theory
that crime is largely a
matter of heredity received
some support the other day
when a young man was
handed a “two stretch” in
a N.S.W. inland town. He
is the fourth of a once well-
known family to embark
upon fraud as a means of
livelihood, and that despite
that he apparently had no
need to adopt such a course.
His father went inside for
embezzlement a good many
years ago, and has never suc-
ceeded in throwing off gaol
associations. The two eldest
sons followed in his foot-
steps, one being convicted for
fqrgery and the other for
burglary. The mother is the
only member of the family
who has a clean record, and
the • irony of it is that it is
probably through her —so far
as the three sons are Con-
cerned- —that the criminal
impulse has been transmit-
ted. Her father was a petty
thief; her mother a success-
ful shoplifter—the line was
founded as so many Potts
Point lines were founded a
century ago.
“Percy Pawnticket”: A well-meaning Mel-
bourne citizen is doubtful whether he chose
the right place for staging a new form of
Christmas entertainment. Moved by- a
benevolent impulse to brighten up Christmas
Eve for the children in the poorest quarters,
he arrayed himself in lambswool whiskers
and the traditional accoutrements of Santa
Claus, and, with a pack of toys on 1 his back,
started on his mission in Fitzroy. Probably
he began to realise his mistake when the
crowd of youngsters who had attached thein-
selves to his train began to jostle him.
Finally some audacious urchin tripped
up the Would-be benefactor, who im-
mediately became tjie centre of a
scramble. When he regained his feet
his toys had vanished; but even this was not
the worst. Some malicious youth, deciding
that his whiskers and the lambswool “fur”
would bufn Well, had applied a- match to
them. The yOfitll whs right, but the con-
sequences wefe rather painful. Never again
SUITED RIGHT OFF.
“I shall marry whom I please.”
“Good! Then, of course, you'll marry me.”
will the benevolent old gent, essay the rble
of Santa Claus in Fitzroy without a police
escort.

“Centurion”: Romance isn't dead, or sen-
timent either. On New Year’s Day there
sailed from England the schooner Marian
to follow the route of Francis Drake’s first
round-the-world voyage in the Golden Hind.
The Marian was scheduled to start from
Appledore, across river from Bideford, in
Devon, where Amyas Leigh watched John
Oxenliam and Salvation Yeo beating up a
crew', and Drake’s own starting-point for
his immortal voyage. One John Henderson
is the chief adventurer ; the master, mate
and crew of 14 are all naval reserve men.
Drake’s route will be followed, and the cities
he sacked will be visited; the bold -Francis’s
bad luck on his first try for the Panama
gold train is not likely to be repeated in
that prohibition zone. It failed because
the train’s advance-guard spotted the am-
bush, owing to the butcher, John Harris,
having “drunk too much of brandy and
rising above the long grass thus discovered
himself.” Drake, too, one may recall, had to
hang his second in command. Doughty, for
attempting to incite a mutiny, but, pre-
sumably, the skipper of the Marian won’t
feel bound to follow that precedent.
■=*■ . * * *
, “O’Back” : Few aspiring politicians know
their limitations so well as a man I struck
out back the other day. He was a station-
hand knocking down a cheque at a bush
pub not so many miles from Broken Hill.
“Why don’t you go in to Broken Hill?” I
asked. “You can have a much better time
there for your money.” “What —and walk
back?” he demanded, with a look expressive
of pity for my inability to sum up a situa-
tion at-a glance.
* - * * *
“Ex-Dig.”: The request of Victorian
homing-pigeon fanciers that the Defence De-
partment should encourage their hobby with
subsidies reminds me that the pigeon was not
a vast success in the war. Army H.Q. had
to be a long time in a given place for the
birds to realise where they, had to go when
released by forward observers or intelligence-
officers; and, apart from those which went
astray, the fool with the lust to kill every-
thing that flies was always likely to block
an urgent message sent by pigeon post.
Moreover, the birds knocked off work directly
the sun set. Flares were much more
reliable than any winged messengers. The
Germans were most advanced in the language,,
and from the front line could direct their
artillery not only to fire, but to fire at any
given target. Still, our flares could be in-
formative. and prompt, too. I once timed
our artillery’s reply to our SOS. The shells
started to fall amongst the advancing Huns
exactly 10 seconds after our green and two
reds had hit the air.
* * * *
“Flicker”: A cobber of mine, who always
ranked Birdwood as the champion “kidder”
of the A.I.F. recalls one occasion on which
the shrewd little brasshat slipped. It was
near Bullecourt; supplies were poor, the rum
issue was held up, and the Diggers were fed
up to the teeth. “Birdie,” passing a group,
heard the old growl that “a man oughter be
poleaxed for cornin’ to this blanky war.” The
General stopped. “Look, men,” he said in his
fatherly way, “I know you’re having a rotten
time, but it’s worth it. Look at those
trenches over there—a month ago they be-
longed to Fritz; now they’re ours. Back
there a little way there is a park of artillery—
a month ago it was Fritz’s; now it’s ours.
Same with that stack of machine-guns.” A
droning overhead drew all eyes, and “Birdie”
beamed at the fresh illustration to his hand.
“Those ’planes! A month ago they were
Fritz’s, now they’re—er—ah!” He got no
further, and the party rose as one man and
disappeared into cover.
* * * *
“Centurion”: This “wifely honor” is a
puzzling thing. The astonishing Mrs. Bob-
in son, on hearing the verdict in the “Indian
potentate” case, remarked cheerfully that her
honor was now cleared, though her own ad-
missions in the witness-box, by word of
mouth, and in writing when speech became
impossible, would seem to point in the other
direction. Almost simultaneously her amaz-
ingly complaisant lawful spouse places his
opinion on record that his honor and that of
his wife had been “completely vindicated,”
although he added that he thought of appeal-
ing against the verdict. Now, from Paris, we
hear of M. Cashing, whose feelings were lacer-
ated because, at a rowdy cafe dinner, a
family friend rubbed some soot on the nose
of Madame Cashing. Madame took it as a
joke, but Monsieur, after stilling her pro-
tests against violence by knocking her down,
shot his friend dead and made “siccar” by
beating in the dead man’s skull with the pis-
tol. That done, he remarked that he had
avenged his wife’s honor and surrendered.
That gives us three differing views of the
same subject, and all of them, to the writer’s
mind, seem open to argument.
* * * *
“Oxmead”: Among the diligently recorded
minutiae of the latest official scragging at
Long Bay (Sydney) I read that the noose
portion of the rope is cased in leather, which
doubtless has a smoother feel than hemp to
the neck that is about to be broken. This
recalls one of the inalienable privileges or,
rather, rights of Britain's old nobility; if a
peer of the realm is sentenced to be hanged
he may claim to be operated on with a
silken cord. The last titled person who stood
on his rights in this connection —prior to
dancing on air—appears to have been the
fourth Earl Ferrers. The perquisite of the
peerage is possibly of no particular interest
in Australia, where noblemen are scarce; but
A GLOOMY PROSPECT.
MRS. JADER (reading advt. of lecture) :
“ ‘Millions now living will never die.' ”
Mr. Jabber who “adores" Ms wife): “Well,
that's the worst piece of news Pee heard
for a long time.”
I have sometimes thought that the ingenious
writers who have specialised in the accounts
of early-day hangings at Sydney, Hobart,
Norfolk Island and elsewhere might have
worked it in. Some of Price Waning’s hard-
ened convicts, particularly, cracked all sorts
of outrageous jokes on the scaffold, but none
of them ever seems to have thought of try-
ing to secure a stay of proceedings by
claiming to be a long-lost nobleman and
demanding to be suspended by a silken cord.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The schoolgirl of to-day is naughtier and more
unmanageable than ever,” says a London high-school
mistress.
In ancient days, when Judah’s king
Went out before the Ark to prance,
With corybantic capering
His handmaids joined him in the dance.
All, the occasion to enhance,
Had “nodings on” from head to toes;
Must we conclude, by any chance,
Our girls are naughtier than thoset
Ere chivalry took final wing
With shining mail and pennon’d lance
Knight-errants rode the woods of Spring
With damsels freed from vile durance.
Yet, no duenna’s steely glance
Froze these Arthurian belles and beaux.
Again the query we advance—
Are our girls naughtier than thoset
Further, let Fancy lightly swing
To melodrama’s moist romance,
Where Beauty, soft and simpering,
Yields to the Villain’s elegance,
The while an aged parent rants
And falls in apoplexy’s throes,
Cursing his che-ild’s dalliance—
Are our girls naughtier than those ?

Even in Eden’s pure pleasance,
Hound Eve and Lilith scandal grows.
We well may ask, with eyes askance,
“Are our girls naughtier than thoset”

“O. McKay M.”: While this hanging
business is in the air, let me in with a real-
life drammer. A few months ago the official
executioner in French Guiana was sentenced
to death for the murder of a convict. The
guillotine has never superseded the rope at
Cayenne, and personal experience appears to
have taught Monsieur Ketch the risk of be-
ing operated on by a raw hand. Anyway, he
appealed for a stay of proceedings, as it
were, until he had time to instruct his suc-
cessor. He didn’t want to be worked off by
a novice.

“Weka”: “Kyver” (B. 25/12/’24) reminds
me that I was responsible for marrying off
the loneliest soldier I ran across. He was a
big chap who had left his out-back farm in
the King Country (M.L.) to grow black-
berries while he went to fight, and he was
one of the eight who made up e :r tent at
Trentham. After a few days I noticed that
he never received a letter or parcel, and. that
while we were investigating our mail he
always went outside. In my home town I
knew a small typiste with few friends, and I
enlisted her sympathy. Next mail day my
lonely soldier was about to withdraw when
he was handed a letter and a cake; his look
of astonishment was worth all the small
trouble I had taken. After that the letters
and parcels became a regular thing, and when
some weeks later I saw him escorting round
NO ALIBI.
GERALD: “Dobson played me a dirty trick. Told my wife he’d
never been sick in his life."
CLARICE: “I don't see anything mean in that"
GERALD: "Yes; hut, I had just told her I had been sitting up all
night with him."
a very shy little girl and pointing out to her
the beauties of the camp I decided he was
lonely no longer. He was back from France
three years ahead of me, and I lost sight
of him until one day two years ago when,
putting in time in a King Country town, ; . I
was hailed from a car in the street by an
excited girl, who informed me breathlessly
that she and Jim had been married for years
and were living on the farm, and would
I come out and stay for as long as I
liked? I did, and nowadays when I look
at my godson I feel I did two lonely people
a good turn.
“Spare Corp”:
A couple of us en-
joyed a festive
Christmas a bit be-
fore the right day-
in 1917 as our
train made its way
to Poperinghe. We
had arrived a t
Hazebruck from
Havre in the dark-
ness, and were
groping along the
tracks td find a
new train, when
the imperious voice
of an officer, who,
apparently, saw us
only vaguely,
boomed out:
“Heah! Lend a
hand with these
cases!” Cor p.
Lewis’s hand de-
tained me as I was
going heedlessly
ahead, and a few
whispered words
that went with it
caused ine to lend
two prompt and
willing hands.
When we opened
those cases of “Offi-
c e r s’ Christmas
comforts” jn a com-
partment in which
some awed but
admiring Tommies
helped us, we found
the materials for a
really memorable
feast. I don’t know
whether any offi-
cers went short of
comforts at the
season of universal
goodwill, but even
if they did they
will be glad to know that a crowd of very
deserving soldiers had a splendid time.
* * * *
“Hamer”: An echo of the 33-year-old
Deeming case was heard in the Richmond
(Vic.) Police Court just before the old year
went out. A sturdy-looking veteran men-
tioned to the magistrate that he had been in
the W.A. police force for 17 years and had
acted as escort for Deeming when the mur-
derer was conveyed from Perth to Melbourne
for trial. The ex-cop had been celebrating
the season of goodwill by offering to fight
the whole world.
“Umfaan”: Vie.
benches have a re-
prehensible habit
of suggesting that
cases of speeding
brought against
medical men “rush-
ing to operations
or accidents” should
be withdrawn.
Why? There may
be more excuse for
the offender, but,
after all, the regu-
lati o n s against
speeding are to pro-
tect the life and
limbs of the public,
especially women
and children. A
doctor hurrying to
see a patient has
no license to im-
peril the lives of
children coming out
from school, elderly
ladies and unwary
pedestrians gener-
ally, or even feo
risk collision with
vehicles that are
moving in more
leisurely fashion.
One medico in a
suburban court re-
eently told the
Bench he was rac-
ing to an accident
as he had an opera-
tion appointment.
“Under the same
circumstances I
would do the
same again,” he
unctuously and theatrically concluded. And
the Bench stultified the law as usual.

“Wink’’: I don’t like to contradict men
who were on the spot, but I and my mates of
the Australian Division have always believed
that the Maorilanders and Light Horsemen
of the Anzac Division who cleaned up Sura-
feud, Palestine (B. 25/12/’24), killed the
wrong parties. Just a few mouths before
the affair, while changing our camels for
horses and learning to use the skewer, we
were camped alongside the same village. The
natives, a dirty, dopey, lazy lot, sold us
tomatoes, water-melons and prickly-pears, and
WALKED INTO IT.
“What did Dad say when you told him we were engaged?"
“Said he knew I’d get myself into trouble the way I’d been hang-
ing round you lately.”
thus had daily opportunities to thieve during
the months they were our neighbors. All
they ever pinched, however, was camel-
manure. Although this w r as quite our best
fuel we would not have grudged it even to
the crows, but we found that the disgusting
villagers crumbled it up and extracted the
undigested whole grain to use with their
scanty stock of new stuff in breadmaking.
As we liked to buy their flat loaves when
our rations ran short we rigidly kept them
out of the camel lines. In all other things
we found them honest; hence our theory that
Surafeud was innocent of the crime for which
it suffered, and that the real culprits were
Bedouins. These wanderers are the most
persistent and ingenious thieves in the world,
and the mere fact that they had pitched camp
in the vicinity should have been enough to
turn suspicion in their direction.
* * * #
“Trapper”: When I was in Wandsworth
Hospital having my knee “fixed,” I learned
from fellow-patients who were well enough
to be allowed a few hours’ leave occasionally
that Petticoat-lane was the home of persons
who would “pinch a bloke’s hat and sell it
back to him 50 yards further down the
street.” Also, that 24 hours after Horse-
ferry-road issued a new leave-pass or office-
stamp, one could purchase a faithful copy
from these enterprising Cockneys. Months
afterwards, when I had finished 14 days’
leave in London at a time when the military
police were greater pests than the Anzac
flies, I thought I would give Petticoat-lane
a spin for a new pass, and there I went
after carefully rolling my putties around
all but one of the 20 quid I had received
from home. Guarded inquiries soon led to
my being escorted into a house where, with
a hand on my shoulder, my new acquaint-
ance guided me into an inner room and pre-
pared the necessary piece of paper. Sud-
denly I became aware that there was a
vacancy where the note should have been,
and mentioned the fact to the forger. “That’s
all right,” he said, displaying the money;
“I helped myself to this as you came in.
Nothing like getting paid in advance.” He
had “lifted” the quid without the slightest
difficulty from my inside tunic-pocket where
the field-dressing is kept.
# * * *
“Bouragi”: It will soon be impossible to
design a lodge for yourself in any vast
wilderness, or to fly to a spot where creditors
and deserted wives will cease from troubling.
The latest invasion of the silences is shortly
due to take place in the Sahara Desert,
hitherto a notoriously quiet and unfrequented
spot. A French company is going to run a
bi-weekly motor service from Algiers to Tim-
buctoo; to cope with the expected rush of
tourists, six hotels are being built along the
route. These are to be fitted with electric
light and will offer “all modern conveni-
ences,” including, presumably, mah jongg and
broadcasting, to say nothing of sheiks (hllnm
variety) for the ladies and Ouled Nail
dancers for the gentlemen. It is a beastly
depressing prospect, and if the tourist traffic
grows heavy enough, the place may even be
traversed by Stephansson or Stefansen, to
say nothing of Francis Birtles.
* * * *
“Tarago": A little over 12 hours before we
had gone over the top, 800 strong, taken all
our bbjectives and hung on to the positions
until we were relieved. Now we were re-
turning with considerably less than 100 men
all told. My mate, Ranji, ran his bleary
eye over the weary, stumbling file in the
grey dawn. “Bliine!” he commented, “they
call this a victory. Wonder what we'd look
like if we got well stoushed!”
* * * *
“Eve II.”: In the Bega (N.S.W.) Dis-
trict Court recently a man sued his father-
iri-law for £34, that being the amount he
regarded as due to him in wages. Appa-
rently he had lived under the same roof
as his employer, for the old man retaliated
by suing for board and lodging for his daugh-
ter and her husband, and half the value of
a pig. The report is silent as to how the
animal or a moiety of it came into the
case, but both disputants got yerdicts for
half the amounts they had claimed. The
whole thing sounds like a bit out of one of
Eden Pliillpotts’s Dartmoor stories.
* * * *
“Percy Pawnticket”: Recent stories of
weary husbands told in Melbourne police-
courts include one of a man who, after
pawning his wife’s belongings, secured a job
for her as a shophand; his subsequent
activities were confined to helping her get
away to work bright and early o’ mornings,
after which he would resume his interrupted
slumbers. Another young man was too tired
to attend court to explain why he had left
his wife without support. He sent his mother
along to say that he couldn’t really work
to keep her, but ma would be willing to give
her a home in her house if she cared to come
along and give a hand with the washing. Ma,
who was a washerwoman, seemed to con-
sider the offer a fair one; she added that her
boy got a pain in the back, whenever he took
a job, while admitting that he had only
tried four in six months. In another
case the wife of an unsuccessful breadwinner,
who admitted having done no regular work for
12 months, appeared as plaintiff in an assault
case. It transpired that she had to keep
the family by her exertions, and that her
domestic duties included serving her lord
with breakfast in bed. It was when she
refused to add the cleaning of his boots to
the breakfast-carrying act that the aggrieved
consort mustered up sufficient energy to give
her a hiding. The Bench bound him over,
and advised the wife to let him fend for
himself.

“Akran”: Cockney wit wasn’t a monopoly
of ’Arry; you had to reckon with ’Arriet,
too. A Digger pal of mine was at the
Coliseum one night. Half a dozen flappers
arrived when the performance had just
NO NEED FOR THE ACCELERATOR.
THE DRIVER : “I didn’t see any harm in a
hiss, did you?”
THE PASSENGER: "Ooh —then why were you
in such a hurry?”
started and effectually obstructed his view
with their headgear. To make it wor£e one
kept moving like a jack-in-the-box. Bill
stood it for a while; and finally, after a
polite protest had been disregarded, he
leaned forward and spoke firmly. “Look
here, miss,” he said, “I want to look as well
as you.” “ ’Adn’t you better go somewhere
and change that face then?” was the retort
that extinguished him.

The twelve months’ profit of £24,590 means
almost 12| p.c. on capital. The usual 10 p.c. is
distributed, leaving a tidy £5308 in the business.
Reserves are thus growing nicely, yet not
too fast considering the prosperous times we
are having. This is the sort of business that
calls for solid reserves if the div. is to be
kept steady: it deals in what to a great
extent are luxuries, and does it largely on
time-payment. The capitalisation of £52,587
in 1920, reducing the reserves to a mere
handful, was an exhibition of over-confi-
dence, and the co. has been very lucky to
get through without cutting down the rate
of dividend. No doubt there was something
more than luck in it: there seems to have
been also an understanding among the chief
firms in the trade not to play cut-throat.
But for that and the good times Australia
has been enjoying, this co. might easily have
been embarrassed by the heavy shipments
that arrived early in 1921. However, things
worked out wonderfully well, and between
Mar., 1921, and Sept., 1923, stock and book
debts (including balances under hire agree-
ments) were worked down from £327,903
to £259,740. Since the latter date there has
been again a solid increase in the figures;
but whether this represents stock or book
debts it is impossible to say, the two being
lumped as this column doesn’t think they
ought to be. The following table shows the
principal movements over a number of years :

Liabilities are heavy : besides owing £106,218
to sundry creditors, the co. is leaning on the
bank for £60,779; the total liability thus
exceeds the capital. And that is irrespec-
tive of a mortgage of £28.500. Notwith-
standing the long run of 10 p.c. divs. the
market, therefore, declines to value the 20s.
shares at more than about 225. 6d. Still,
immediate prospects are excellent; and every
thousand added to reserves in these fat days
will help the co. through the times when
Miss Psmith will find it harder to persuade
pa to put in a piano-player in place of the
good old cottage upright.

This was an Earle Herman flotation in
which goodwill figured at £9OOO and leases
at £3560, and in which stock and plant were
over-valued. The co. struggled on for four
years and then had a clean-up: £30,000 of
capital was struck off, and on the other side
assets were written down and goodwill
(£9000) thrown out altogether. Manage-
ment was also overhauled; and the results
showed in the years which followed. Then
the shareholders went gay and repeated the
errors of 1910. Plant was revalued and
written up by £33,800, visible reserves of
£l2 590 were transferred and goodwill placed
in the books at £7522. Paid capital was
thereby increased from £45,000 to £lOO,OOO.
Thus in one swoop, the Bs. which had been
written off each share was put back, with a
further 6s. Sd. for good measure. The Armis-
tice boom delayed the awakening, and m the
peak year profits, or what looked like profits,
encouraged the directors to hand out £BOOO,
equal to about 18 p.c. on the former capital.
Even when the slump came the directors
paid a div. of about 11 p.c. on that capital.
Since then, though a very fair business has
been done, it has been a struggle to pay a
decent-sized div. on the inflated with
the result that, when the co. had to get out
of the Bridge-street premises, it could only
acquire a modest home in George-street by
putting on it a blister of £15,667 (its book
value is £42,465) and raising £29,000 on
7 p.c. debentures. Balance-sheet items have

The South Brisbane Gas and Light
Co., Ltd. —Early in 1924 the Board called
in public accountant J. P. Macfarlane to re-
port on the co.’s position. His conclusions
confirmed those at which the “Wild Cat”
had arrived many years earlier. In 1914 the
co. had written up its assets and made a
bonus issue of £lOO.OOO of debenture stock,
and this Column believed that to be wholly
unjustified. Mr. Macfarlane’s finding was
that, as at Dec. 31, 1923, £156,756 of the
book values were unrepresented by assets.
His recommendations were: —
That capital should be written down by £lOO.OOO
and the balance extinguished out of reserves. That
the £lOO,OOO of interminable debentures should be
surrendered and replaced by fully-paid prefs. for
half the amount; that the 80,000 10s. prefs. should
be reduced to 52,000 and the 120,000 10s. ordinaries
to 48,000.
Shareholders met on June 13, 1924, but the
accountant’s recommendations were not
accepted. Instead, a committee was ap-
pointed to see if there was not some way by
Avhich you could drink your beer and have
it too. Debenture holders were the stumbling-
block. Ui*ler Mr. Macfarlane’s recommenda-
tions they were to be drastically dealt with ;
and, although in view of the manner of the
stock’s creation he doubtless justified his
recommendation, holders definitely refused to
forego arty of their capital. The special
committee which was appointed consisted of
W. B. Darker (chairman), Alex. Corrie,
M. S. Herring. J. P. Macfarlane, J. S. Me-
limes, W. S. Moore and W. E. Savage. It
opened its report:—
We are satisfied hhat the company is over-capitalised
and that both the share capital and the book value
of assets should be written down. This over-capitali-
sation is the result of the action of the shareholders
themselves in agreeing to- the writing up of the
assets.
It added that the debenture stock was a hind-
rance to the co. in obtaining capital neces-
sary to expand, and, since tlae holders refused
to accept a reduction in faicc value, recom-
mended them to convert into a special class
of cum. participating prefs. upon the follow-
ing conditions*:—
Holder to be entitled to £1 of prefs. for each £l
of stock held ; stch prefs. to be 6 p.c. cum., with the
right to a further 2 p.c. out of surplus profits when
the ordinaries received 10 pte.g priority rights to
capital in the ruse of a windlng-up up to capital
value and array's of div., but no further right;
the Board to ha»re the right to issue further prefs.,
ranking pari passu in all respects with the prefs.
mentioned, or eten ranking in priority to them.
The stock carried interest Jtt 5 p.c. with the
right to adcjtional interest not exceeding
a further 5 p.c. p.a. after divs. of 10 p.c.
had been paid on both prefsL and ordinaries.
But in view of the existence of so much
share capital;not represented by assets, any-
thing beyond* 5 p.c? was, of course, stuff of
which dreamy are made. In any case, out of
the 5 p.c. lifcd to be deducted both Federal
and State income-taxes, so- that the new pro-
posal was it?ally better than an additional
certain 1 p*c., with more than a passable
prospect later on of a furtjher 2 p.c.
The other recommendations were that the
80,000 old prefs. should be reduced from
10s. to ss. each, and eonverlted into ordi-
naries, the 120,000 ordinaries reduced from
10s. to 2s. 6d. each, and various reserves
written off. In all:
Prefs £20,000
Ordinaries .. .. .. 45,000
Capital reserve .. .. .. 48,143
Gas Act reserve .. .. .. 3,000
Suspense refund of income tax .. 4,458
P. & L .. .. 6,872
A total of £127,473
The original prefs. w'ere 6 p.c. cum., but
had no priority as to capital. They went
to 10 p.c. w r hen the ordinaries had received
10 p.c., and followed the ordinaries if the
rate higher. At June 30 the pref. div.
was in arrears to the amount of £3600, which
influenced the committee in recommending
that they be reduced by only ss. W'hen con-
verted into ordinaries. This compromise be-
tween the two classes of shares is a fair one;
and, though the stock holders come out of
the trouble better than the original holders
deserve, the co. was well advised to accept
the proposed arrangement.
The annual meeting was delayed to Nov.
28 in order that, under amended articles,
the whole Board might be turned out if
shareholders so desired. They did so desire.
All members of the old Board except A. S.
Lang nominated, but W, B. Darker was
the only one re-elected. The directors now
are; W. B. Darker (chairman), W. Bul-
cock, H. J. Darragh, J. Dowrie, W. E.
Savage. It is not much use at this time of
day reviewing the accounts as at June 30.
After providing interest on £50,000 owing
to the bank (on a 5 p.c. debenture due 1934)
and £20,000 owing on an 8 p.c. debenture,
and setting aside £5OOO a year for extensions,
the committee thinks it can sec 6 p.c. for
both ordinary and pref. shares. The esti-
mate seems to be conservative. Meantime
negotiations are still in the air for amalga-
mation with or purchase by the Colonial
Gas Co.
At the end of this queer business The
Bulletin can’t help feeling a bit sorry for
the slaughtered directors. They were to
blame, no doubt; but the shareholders sup-
ported them in their evil courses, even to
the extent, at a meeting in Feb., 1918, of
unanimously recommending the Board to
“go for The Bulletin for defamation or
whatever it may be.” Unfortunately for
shareholders they were permitted to continue
living in their fool’s paradise: no action was
taken, and it was six years before they
found out what “it” might be besides defama-
tion.

Gross working profit was £435,210, an in-
crease of £62.457 over 1923, and £125,655
over 1922. But while there was an increase
of 40 p.c. in the two years in these gross
earnings there was a growl’: of only 27 p.c. in
management exes, (including rebates), which
accounts for the gallop in net profits. All the
same, the Board has had a trying time. After
thinking up all it knew and making depre-
ciation allowances on plant and motor-cars
and casks and other things to the extent of
£47,276, it still had £120.352 (minus £lO,OOO
for taxation) to dispose of. Finally it
decided on these appropriations:—
Reserve fund .. .. £ 50,000
General depreciation .. 10,000
Dividend equalisation .. 10,000
Reserve for rebates.. .. 10,000
Interim divs. took £lB 693, so there was left
a net balance of £11,659, which, with what
was brought into the accounts, sends £56.141
(minus the final div.) to next balance. What
the final div. was in percentage or amount
the report does not say. For some years an
estimate was possible because the last quar-
ter was generally at the same rate as it
had been in the other quarters. In the ’23
appropriation, however, the final div. proved
to be £7969. which was 3| p.c. on the capital
of £212,506, or at the rate of 15 p.c. p.a.
The amount disclosed as paid in interim divs.
last year works out at about 111 p.c. So
a query is dropped into the div. column
of the introductory table, and, of course,
into the reserves column. There is no dis-
cernible reason why the directors should not
state plainly the rate and amount. The Wild
Cat hates its tables to be made untidy.
The co. was started 20 years ago by a
few T of the big hotelkeepers in Melbourne who
could do w ? ith a bit more. Success attended
the effort from the start. Other hotel-
keepers wanted to come in, and they were
welcomed —providing they had the price.
About ten years ago some of the ss. shares
sold at as much as 255. premium ; over
£72,000 had been obtained by that means up
to the reconstruction. From 1906 divs.
ranged from 70 p.c. to 110 p.c., except when
a beer drought was predicted by Victoria’s
Cold Tea meteorologists, and it fell to a
paltry 20 p.c. or so. However, the threatened
calamity w r as averted, and the co. simply
had to do something. Reconstruction was
the way out; and, apparently, one fully-
paid £1 share for every ss. paid was issued.
Up to the reconstruction trade bonuses were
shown: the principle was to distribute
bonuses as nearly as possible equally to divs.
In the ’23 balance-sheet a reserve for re-
bates made its appearance, and this was
added to last year. But “special discounts”
(charged in with management exes.) now
probably hide rebates, so that this is almost
certainly a true reserve, and is included with
the rest in the introductory table. Here
are some balance-sheet comparisons:—
1905. 1910. 1915. 1920. 1924.
£ £ £ £ £
Capital .. 11,262 21,399 27,131 52,589 215,448

Cash, etc... 317 894 3,378 6,311 64,587
Nowadays an overdraft would not have the
nerve to show its face on the premises. Lia-
bilities are almost exclusively money owing
on open account, and cash and book debts
alone more than cover them. Reserves after
the payment of the final div. must have been
somewhere about the £200,000 mark. A re-
markable record.
* * * #
The Colonial Provident Life and
General Assurance Co., Ltd., was registered
in Sydney in August, 1923, 17,000 fully-paid
ordinaries going to the promoter. The first
balance-sheet covers the period from regis-
tration to Nov. 30 last, although active
canvassing, according to the report, did not
commence until June. It is a disconcerting
document. Of £31,956 of capital, £28,498
has gone in establishment account —Promo-
tion expenses, £17,007; brokerage and ex-
penses of share-selling agencies, £2988; ex-
penses in excess of revenue, £8503. And
this is what is left of the capital:—
Cash (less liabilities) .. £1494
Agents’ balances .. .. 280
Book debts, etc. .. .. 137
Stationery .. .. .. 282
Furniture, motor-cars .. .. 1262
Deposit, electric light.. ~ 2
That adds up to £3457. What lias the
Board to say? It has “considered it advis-
able that the volume of business sought
should be in ratio to the issue of subscribed
capital.” For the period 73 policies were
issued assuring £28,567. representing annual
premiums of £lOl6. Total net premium in-
come for the period was: Life £599, other
£5B. Only £14,956 was subscribed in money,
and that was a hopelessly inadequate sum
on which to start on a fight in this field of
insurance-selling. A less discriminating
policy would probably have insured a much
greater volume of business, says the Board.
Directorates of other young cos. make the
same remark. It is the business of an in-
surance co. to select its risks, and to state
unctuously, or even casually, that such has
been done is to imply that the alternative is
permissible. For an insurance co. not to
pick its risks would be as reprehensible as
for a mercantile house to grant credit in-
discriminately. But the co. is looking ahead :
it intends to apply for membership of the
Fire Underwriters’ Association to enable ?t
to accept all classes of insurance. “In the
meantime arrangements have been made
with the Commonwealth General Assurance
Corporation, Ltd., to issue through us their
policy for all fire insurance written.” Last
balance the condition of the Commonwealth
General was not markedly strong in any
department, to put it kindly. During the year,
under tiie arrangement, 10 policies w r ere
written for £3660, with a total premium
of £25. In the liabilities shown above, by
the way, the liabilities under these and the
co.’s other policies are not included.
The co. is now seeking further capital.
Share-selling agencies in Brisbane and Mel-
bourne are reported to have disposed of
shares with fair success, and “a sufficient
staff of thoroughly experienced and trust-
worthy share salesmen” has been organised,
which inspires the directors with confi-
dence for the coming year. The question
arises: What arguments are used in this
share-selling campaign? In the prospectus
it was extravagantly stated —“emphasised,”
in fact —that “shares will, in all probability,
next year be sold at a premium.” Is a pre-
mium being got? If so, on what grounds
can it possibly be justified? Here is a co.
with a capital of £31,956. and all it has got
(besides its name) is £3457, and the bulk of
that is in such things as agents’ balances,
stationery and the like worth little or no-
thing for paying claims. The co. has no hope
of making a profit on its present capital with
its present monetary resources; and the cost
of getting additional capital must in the

I'iuckly-peah Erapicatob, Ltd. —There
are some interesting features about this pros-

The vendors (Arthur Rickard & Co., Ltd.,

offer to the new co. a license “for N. S.
Wales only” to use a pear-eradicating
machine, a poison formula, a small plant (af
cost) and certain lands either cleared of
pear or partly cleared (also at cost). The
machine, built on a caterpillar tractor, “is
capable of treating eight acres a day of

land thickly peared is approximately 20s.
per acre. The life of the machine is esti-
mated at from, five to six years, and the
cost of replacement is included in the abova
estimate of 20s. per acre.” Two areas
were bought, one near Aberdeen, the other
near Muswcllbrook. The latter area (297
acres) which “cost £550, now cleared of
pear and partly under crop, is estimated to
be worth £2000.” According to a report by
the inventor, R. G. McLeod, “the machine
commenced work [on the Muswellbrook
property] on May 14, 1924. Ploughing
commenced on July 20, and wheat was
planted in August. Another area was planted
with Soudan grass in Sept., and millet a little
later. The wheat. .. .had little or no rain
till it began to ear: the crop is short bin.
even. The Soudan grass.... is now one of
the best crops ever seen in the district. The
millet also promises well.” This land was
heavily peared. It is claimed that the pear
is completely destroyed. It is a pity the
demonstration was not begun a year earlier,
and that an independent authority was not
now—2o months later—called in to report.
If the process will do what is claimed, and
at the price mentioned, there is no doubt a
lot of money is to be made either by contract-
ing to clear or by the purchase of pear land
and its subsequent sale as cleared
land. The proof of the efficacy of the pro-
cess, though it might be better, is fair; and
the quoted cost is astonishingly low. The
capital is in 75,000 £1 ordinaries offered to
the public, and 25,000 deferreds, which go
to the vendors. These deferreds are, how-
ever, deferred only to this extent; if the co.
should be wound up before the ordinaries
get £25,000 or that much has accumulated as
profit, then the ordinaries shall rank for
return of capital ahead of deferreds. The
most interesting (and, incidentally, an admir-
able) feature is that, though the directors
may go to allotment when 20,000 shares have
been applied for, in that case the. vendors
would get only 6666 deferreds; in other
words, the proportion of deferreds to ordi-
naries will not exceed one to three. By the
way, the undertaking that the ordinaries
shall rank ahead of the deferreds until
£25.000 of profit lias been made is not
limited in any way: apparently it stands
whether 20,000 or 75,000 ordinaries are
applied for.

The value of the N. S. Wales mineral out-
put for 1924 is expected to be a record, due
chiefly to the high prices ruling for lead,
zinc and silver. The silver-lead and coal-
mines were the outstanding contributors to
the production and the greater value. The
1923 output, £16,291,000, beat the previous
best return by £1,872,000, and that figure
should easily be exceeded. It is officialy esti-
mated that, including 1924 production, the
aggregate value of minerals produced in the
State will be approximately £383,000,000.
All mines operating along the line of lode
in Broken Hill (with the exception of Cen-
tral and Block 10) worked practically full
time over the period and more than 1,050,000
tons of ore was raised, an increase of over
170,000 tons as compared with 1923. Yerran-
derie (N.S.W.) maintained a good output
during the year. The coal output is esti-
mated at lli million tons, which will be
700,000 tons greater than 1921 yield. Of the
other minerals tin is the only one worthy of
mention. The high market lifted values and
is encouraging production.

Developments in British spelter are fore-
shadowed by the Financial Times, accord-
ing to a cable :
As the contract with the Belgian smelters for
the supply of Australian concentrates expires in
1925, Sir Robert Horne has left on a visit to
Australia and Bunnah in connection with the supply
of raw material for the National Smelting Company.
The American surplus has recently been reduced,
and Germany’s buying has depleted European sup-
plies, so that a British shortage is threatened. The
present stock in the United Kingdom is only 500
tons.
This is borne out by the fact that prompt
delivery is at a premium of ss. For the
nine months to September 30 last imports
were 96,153 tons, as compared with 95.253
tons for the corresponding period of 1923,
an increase of 900 tons to meet a much
greater increase in consumption. America is
using almost the whole of its production and
most of Belgium’s surplus is going to Ger-
many. British smelters produced only about
2500 tons. Broken Hill is doing its utmost
to take advantage of present conditions, and
the facts should liven production in other
places in Australia.
The Lawn Hills silver-field, near Burke-
town (N.Q.), is only in the prospecting stage
at the moment, and galena is being gouged
out on half a dozen promising shows. This
is running 30oz. to 50oz. of silver, and most
of it is free from zinc. The field was once
worked fairly extensively, and the present
activity is merely a resuscitation due to the
high market for lead. As an objective for
prospecting it is promising, for there is a
mineralised belt, 25 miles by 10 miles,
scarcely explored, in which further strikes
are likely. The disadvantages of the field
are obvious —its isolation, difficulty in getting
stores, high prices and crushing freight rates.
The lodes are almost clean galena, easy of
gouging, and run anything up to sft. in
thickness, while several, notably the Silver
Queen, Silver King and Album, promise con-
siderable length.

Bowen River coalfield (Q.), at one time
regarded as a probable colossus among Aus-
tralian producers, has had practically nothing
published in the past regarding the quality
of the coal likely to be available for mining.
Geologist ,T. 11. Reid’s table of coal analyses
shows that all the seams are characterised
by a moderately high to very high ash con-
tent. Of 30 analyses from the Bowen seam,
and that is the one wherein lies the chief
hope of the field, the ash ranges from 9.8 p.c.
to 22.2 p.c., so that there is apparently no
hope of the field supplying A-grade coal
under 9 p.c. ash, such as the Greta seam
supplies in N.S.W. Two analyses of run-of-
mine coal from the State colliery show 14.6
p.c. and 14.8 p.c. ash, while samples from
the Bowen Consolidated mine (Garrick
seam) go 13 p.c. These figures show that
Greta coal for export need not fear serious
competition unless the Bowen coals are
treated for ash elimination. The Bowen
seam is very low in sulphur, but the Garrick
is soft and sulphurous, which will cut
it out as a bunker coal and render washing
a necessity for coke-production.

The silver-lead veins recently opened up
in the Kilkivan district (Q.) are not likely
to create anything beyond strictly local ex-
citement. Six months’ work has been put
in by a syndicate, and some good-looking-
galena produced. Geologist C. C. Morton
says the work done to date indicates that
the veins are small and too low-grade to pro-
mise profitable exploitation. The indications
are also towards pyritic ore below the oxi-
dised zone, which may be slightly auriferous.
Zinc also occurs, and the primary ore looks
like being complex, so that anything small
will be of little use.
* * * *
Ravenswood (Q.) is paying nicely from the
small rich shoots on the Duke reef, and is
breaking good ore on the No. 5 level. The
underlie shaft has been sunk a further 115 ft.,
at which point they have started No. 6. The
lode there is unpayable, but the shaft has
been the same all the way down, and there
are very fair grounds for expecting that the
level will eventually run into pay ore. Re-
cent crushings have been, on a small scale,
reminiscent of the early days on the Towers,
when the Eastward Ho and St. Patrick’s
sent their shareholders crazy. The last
crushing early in December was 22 tons for
2370 z., while for the first three months the
figures run to 220 tons for 8400 z., to which
recoveries from concentrates have to bie
added. And the concentrates are carrying
good values.
• * * *
For a small show the Old Bradlaugh, Her-
berton (N.Q.), lately had a dazzling return:
116 tons yielded 36.5 tons of concentrates
worth £5790. But work is at present con-
fined to development and sinking a shaft to
connect with the main tunnel workings.

The Anakie (Q.) sapphire field is keeping
the pace recently set under the Government’s
new buying and grading arrangements. Cer-
tainly the November output reached only
about £2OOO, but mining was hampered in
that month by continuous rain. The output is
all from old ground. Several prospectors
have been sinking in likely-looking wash in
new territory along Tomahawk Creek, but so
far have not struck the old alluvial bed.

A recent arrival at Mt. Isa (Q.) is R. M.
Taylor, superintendent of a low-grade Mis-
souri (U.S.A.) lead deposit. He is an
expert on concentration of low-grade silver-
lead ores, and is sampling and measuring up
the lodes on Isa. He is content with 5 p.c.
lead in The States, so that Mt. Isa should
excite his enthusiasm, for Ernest Bail’s esti-
mate of 900,000 tons of ore for every 100 ft.
in depth does not include anything averaging
below 1 5 p.c.

Lucknow Mines (N.S.W.) has a nominal
capital of £30,000 in 150.000 4s. shares. Of
these, however, only 57.200 have put up any
cash,, and they are paid to 2s. sd. Of the
remainder 40.000 fully-paids went to the
vendors in 1922, and 52.800 contribs. are
unissued. The goods vended have never made
themselves manifest. When South Lucknow
was in the boom in Pitt-street in 1922, Luck-
now shares were pushed up in sympathy,
contribs. seeing 4s. 6d. The old shafts and
levels were subjected to a desultory scraping,
the old battery made fit to crush, and 27
tons treated for 470 z. During the past IS
months three attempts by the directors to
wind up the concern were frustrated by the
shareholders. Exemption from labor con-
ditions was secured for 12 months; but the
Mines Department put its foot down at last,
and on December 20 the warden at Orange
refused a suggested cessation for a further
six months. The balance-sheet shows, a net
loss of £333 for the year, and a total at
debit of p. and 1. of £2281. Meantime share-
holders are asked to be patient and to pin
their faith to a vague Lucknow Amalgamated
scheme, which is said to lie somewhere in the
future.
* * * *
The minimum wage at Broken Hill of 15s.
a day is considerably above the declared liv-
ing wage. The unions have seen to it that
higher rates are paid for any work requir-
ing even a minimum of skill, so that the
majority receiving this wage are youths
from 17 up, foreigners just out, and the
few who can offer no more than brawn. For
surface men 44 hours is. a week’s work.
Wages of tradesmen vary, but for fitters and
like trades are 19s. a day, and for rough car-
penters 21s. For underground men 35
hours—five days of seven hours—constitute
a week’s work, with no night-shift or Satur-
day labor. There is a shortage of miners
and, taking advantage of this and the fact
that the companies are prepared to pay it,
miners will not look at a contract offering
less than £2 a shift without bullocking.
Other underground workers are paid propor-
tionately. With such high wages a shift is
lost on almost any pretext and broken time
is not unusual. In addition to short hours
and high wages a compensation scheme makes
provision for those rejected from the in-
dustry on account of industrial disease.
With conditions such as these the unions
know it is futile to attempt to make any
kind of a case in the Arbitration Court for
an all-round increase of £1 a week and 40
hours for surface men. Hence the post-
ponement of the stop-work meeting and the
agreement to the conference.

Under the N.S.W. Mining Act passed last
session, all private lands will now be opened
to mining for minerals specified. It was in-
tended under the 1918 Act that access under
mining title should be given to all lands not
being worked in which the minerals were
vested in the owner, but a Privy Council
decision prevented the Mines Department
from granting titles in certain cases. As
the position is now altered owners of re-
served minerals are to be allowed until March
23 to commence operations or make a title
under the Mining Act. Leases to mine for
coal within a colliery holding may now be
amalgamated, although they do not adjoin,
provided that the areas are less than a mile
apart and the coal can be mined from exist-
ing workings.

A sft. seam of coal at Ulan, near Mudgeo
(N.S.W.), is to be given attention by a
syndicate. A 43cwt. parcel tested at Mudgee
gasworks returned 12,600 ft. of gas and good-
quality coke.

Taranaki Oil, according to a statement
from Collins House, has obtained from the
Maoriland Government 25,000 acres of con-
tiguous oil-prospecting areas in Westland,
South Island. Here there is an anticlinal
axis in tertiary strata, with “a big oil seep-
age” on a minor anticlinal axis nine miles
long lying east and nearer the hills. Some
of the country was bored nine years ago and
several barrels of oil obtained. But even
this slice plus the New .Plymouth area of
Maoriland apparently is not enough for the
Baillieus and their friends ; anyway, the Gis-
borne Oil Proprietary Co., which has a
nominal capital of £60,000 in £1 shares, has
let the Taranaki Oil Co. take up 7000 of
its shares at par and has given it a call
over 10,000 more shares, all at 20s. each. The
Gisborne Co. was formed to get hold of the
oil rights over country near Gisborne, in the
Poverty Bay district, on the east side of the
North Island. “Natural gas seepages” are
the draw there. Colin Fraser goes on the
Gisborne board to represent the Taranaki.
Dr. Clapp will run his rule over the
co.’s area, and he may also have a look
at the West Coast blocks. Taranaki itself
has bottled up 968 acres above and below
high-water mark at New Plymouth. This
is where the old drills went down which
yielded about 60,000 barrels of oil and is
only a few fathoms from the spot in the
Pacific where bubbly oil daily films the blue
seas. A. H. P. Moline is putting up a drill
of 4500 ft. capacity on this patch of the
shore. Another will dig-in at Tarata, 16
miles off. If Collins House has been quiet
over its M.L. venture it hasn’t been idle.

batteries m the West. Since then 1,400,000
tons of gold-bearing rock and 80,000 tons of
tin ore have been treated for a return of
nearly £5,000,000. Expenditure generally
exceeds revenue by £lO,OOO or more a year,
out this loss to the State is more than offset
by the benefits derived by out-back prospec-
tois and claimholders who are the principal
customers of these mills. About 20 plants
are at present in operation, which treat
approximately 30,000 tons a year

Queensland Premier Theodore, who is
booked for retirement next month, has let it
be known that, if he fails to become M.H.R.
for the Herbert at the next Federal election,
he will settle down at Banyan, in the Innis-
fail district, and grow sugar-cane. A brother
lives at Banyan, where a sugar-mill with the
latest improvements has been built for the
State Government.
“Hugh Stone”: William Cullen, the Ma
State’s Chief Justice, retires this month.
Fifty-four years ago I sat on the same form
with him in a bush school, Jerara Yale —he
was born in the neighborhood. Dad Cullen
was a God-fearing soul who tilled the soil
during the week and spread the glad tidings
on a Sunday in the little village of Jam-
beroo. William had a journalist brother
who went to Westralia, became an M.L.C.
and died there. The C.J. himself was an
M.L.C. in the ’nineties, and for a while he
was M.L.A. for Camden.

Russell could make room for him by resign-
ing from the Southern Province. Russell

“Bouragi’s” appreciation:—
John Hubert Plunkett Murray, Lieut.-Governor of
Papua, has been made a K.C.M.G. In his own country
he is entirely without honor of the popular sorr,
though he is the last man on earth to care a hang
about that. Had he been doing the same work
under the British Colonial Office, he would by this
time have been ranking with such men as Lugard,
Harry Johnston, Swettenham and his own great pre-
decessor, Maegregor. True, Murray had “Old
Billy’s” magnificent foundations to build upon, but
these had been overgrown by the jungle let in
by the ineptitude of Le Hunte and Barton. When
Murray, then the Judicial officer of Papua, took
over the Administrator’s job, Barton’s services hav-
ing been dispensed with by a Royal Commission, lie
had to use the scrub-knife pretty vigorously, and
some of the lopped-off growth did its best to dis-
parage his work. Certain of the missionaries were
unfriendly on other grounds. The great influx of
planting interests, which was coincident with Murray s
promotion, added another difficult element to a
job already thick w'ith them. The demand for
native labor increased tremendously, and agitation
for looser control and methods of recruiting raged
in Papua and the lobbies of the Federal Parliament
as well. It. required unfailing tact, firmness and
good temper to cope successfully with all these
influences; the best proof of Murray’s success is
tnat, in spite of the severe handicaps and restrictions
under which the Possession has been placed by the
Commonwealth Governments, it is to-day an admitted
model for others of its sort. He is a native of Sydney,
and was 63 on Dec. 29; Prof. Gilbert Murray is
his brother.

To Mostyn Evan came, on Christmas Day,
the sudden ending that awaits a weak heart.
He had been about Adelaide as usual, but
when he laid down the presidency of S.A.
Cricket Association, just on the eve of the
English team’s arrival, it was known that
he felt compelled to go slow. Articled to C. C.
Kingston; of the law firm of Varley, Evan
and Thomson for over 30 years; president
for many years of S.A. Lacrosse and Bowls
associations; chairman of Adelaide News

Cricket Association, he crowded a lot into
his 61 years. The big new stand at the
Adelaide Oval bears his name.
The late William Archer was a member
of an adventurous Scottish family, one
branch of which settled in Norway (hence,
no doubt, the critic’s early interest in Nor-
wegian literature) and another in Queens-
land. It was in 1856, the year in which Wil-
liam was born, that Thomas, his father, and
a brother took up their famous station of
Gracemere, near Rockhampton. On the lake
or mere from which it took its name, myriads
of waterfowl sported unharmed. Thomas
Archer was a member of more than one
Queensland Parliament, and for a while
he bossed the Agency-General in London. A
Norwegian kinsman designed and built Nan-
sen’s famous ship, the Fram, the first to
drift across the Arctic Circle. William
Archer visited Queensland only once, as a
young man, but his patronymic is held in
high esteem in the northern State, as much
for the good repute of his family as for his
own literary fame.
Achalen W. Palfreyman, who was Henry
Jones’s first partner in the jam business and

Marshall J. McMahon, who has been

“T.P.”: Bishop Julius, who retired re-
cently in M.L., is as breezy a cleric as ever
donned the lawn. When an archdeacon at
Ballarat, his unconventionality was a worry
to his intensely proper bishop, Dr. Thornton,
who, after a quarter-century’s “colonial” ex-
perience, was still a newclium. Once Julius
arrived while a push was man-handling a
constable who was trying to arrest two of
their number, and being a fine boxer and
wrestler he waded in. The policeman
grabbed one offender, and the Archdeacon
the other, the rest taking to their heels. On
the way to the lockup the Cloth's captive
broke loose and renewed hostilities, but
Julius methodically cuffed him into submis-
sion, and the pilgrimage was resumed.
David Gordon, who got a New Year knight-
hood in South Aus., has had a varied experi-
ence in his just-on 60 years of life. He had
tried farming and commerce (with John
Darling and Son) before joining the
Register staff at 23. After 22 years on the
Register he dropped journalism for politics,
and got into the House of Reps, in 1913,
but lost his seat next year. Since then he
has been in the S.A. Leg. Council. Gordon
has written several books on water conserva-
tion, and is one of the authorities on Murray
questions. Latterly lie has been in partner-
ship with Arthur Evans as accountant and
company secretary.
Arthur McCubbin, who died at Manly dur-
ing the holidays, had the rare distinction of
serving in both the Army and Navy during

land, he fought through the Gallipoli cam-
paign with the First Otago Battalion. An
engineer’s commission in the Royal Navy
followed —his profession was that of marine
engineer—and he saw a lot of service afloat;
at Jutland he had the nervy job of senior-
lieut. engineer on a destroyer. A capital
Rugby footballer, he was only 37 when the
sudden end came.
“Scebee” : Evidently Downing-street thinks
that Vic. has more than enough knights
already, for Cattanach’s C.M.G.-ship was the

hardly a board or body of any kind assembles
without a sprinkling of them. It was time
a halt was called.
“Nom”: A recent Bulletin par. enumer-
ated a few of the celebrities who will be able
to sport a free pass if the indicated N.S.W.
bill is passed. The name of Jack Meehan
might have been included. Jack reached
Parliament in 1904 by beating Nick Willis,
of land scandals notoriety, and held on for
three terms, until his electorate disappeared.
He was perhaps the roughest diamond that
any Parliament ever possessed. At the clos-
ing day of his first legislative term he
strapped on a swag in approved sundowner
fashion, and, black billy in hand, bounced
into the Assembly chamber with a “S’long,
boys, I’ll meet y’ at the next shed.” But
his most notorious outburst was on an occa-
sion when a Parliamentary dinner was being
given to a group of visiting members of
the House of Commons, the State Governor
being present. Two members of his party
were despatched to ask Jack to stay away.
That settled it; Jack and his grey suit were
in “early doors.” Presently Lord Emmet,
replying to a toast, was making the kind of
“crimson thread of kinship” speech that
suited an occasion of mixed parties, when
suddenly he said something about a united
Empire. Jack rose with a bellow of “United !
Why don’t you give the poor Irish
Home Rule?” Jack has long since become a
citizen of Victoria and a pronounced water-
waggoner.
The best yarn told by Frank Clarke, Pre-
sident of Vic. Uppah Chambah, in his book-
let on Melbourne Botanic Gardens is about
that Earl, the Commonwealth’s first G.-G.,
whose memory Hopetoun lawn helps to keep
green. Clarke relates that one week-end
when Hopetoun. his family and some rela-
tives were staying in an up-country town
the whole contingent went to church and
filled two front pews. The meenister took
as his text (from Ecclesiastes) “Vanity of
vanities, all is vanity,” and then, lifting up
his eyes to his congregation, began to explain
it thus: “My friends, the world is full of
blasted hopes.” Hope was his Ex.’s family
name, but the Earl had a sense of humor.
What Frank does not mention is that Hope-
toun told the yarn to his Ministers after
the next meeting of the Executive Council.
No wonder he used to get an average attend-
ance of 11 at E.C. meetings.
George Cotterill, a Ma State school inspec-
tor who retired recently, was commissioned
in his young days to open a school at Spring-
side, near Orange. He copied the methods
of a theatrical advance-agent by placarding
the town with posters, and on the eventful
morning his vigorous bell-ringing attracted
39 children and half the township. He had
a lot of bother assembling the young idea
in a straight line, and an order to “right
turn” had to be altered to “All face Cdfcey”
before the nippers understood. Cotterill
chalked blackboards for four years at Spring-
side, and after various changes, including 17
years as Paddington's headmaster, became
an inspector in 1908. Music was his
specialty, and the tuning-fork was oftener in
his hand than the ferrule.
There are those who say that Prendergast

Sir Edwin Lutyens, now on liis way to
Australia, is one of the world’s greatest
makers of monuments. He built public in-
stitutions in Rome and Delhi; but since
1918 he has been kept busy designing
war memorials. His chief _ achievement
in that direction is the Whitehall Ceno-
taph. As a member of the Imperial War
Graves Commission, he has had a good deal
to do with the disposition of the A.I.F. ceme-
teries in France.
“Sylva”: It is a long while since N.S.W.'s
two Forestry Commissioners played speaks.
Minister Wearne has, therefore, put through
a bill to cut the number down to one, the idea
being that one would not be able to fall out
seriously with himself. This means presum-
ably that the second Commissioner, Norman
Jolly, who is a scientifically-trained forestry
expert, will have to go. Jolly was a S. Aus-
tralian Rhodes Scholar who did well at
Oxford and then had experience in Burma be-
fore returning to Australia. He has not
been able to hit it off with Dalrymple Hay,
the Chief Commissioner. Some of the people
interested in the timber business do not like
him, either; they think lie is exacting in his
demands on behalf of the State. Yet if he
goes N. S. Wales will lose one of the very
few foresters in Australia who have been
trained on up-to-date lines.
“S. J. 8.”: The Duke of Saxe-Coburg-
Gotha, who lost his job after the war, was
not the son of the Duke of Edinburgh who
held the German title from 1893 to his death
(B. 25/12/’24). That Duke’s only son,
Alfred, died in 1599 of phthisis. When
the Duke himself died, in 1900, the next in
succession was the Duke of Connaught, but
both he and his son Arthur turned the job
down, preferring to remain British. This
resulted in Charles Edward, previously Duke
of Albany, son of Queen Victoria’s youngest
son Leopold, becoming Duke of S.-C.-G. It
was he who recently lost his billet.
Alfred E. Rainbow, of Gray’s Inn, is on
his way hack to Sydney via the South Ameri-
can republics. Rainbow, who hails from
Kiama (N.S.AV.), carried off the Broughton
and Forrest exhibition from the King’s
School, and went up to Gonville and Caius
College, Cambridge, where he collected first-
class honors (law tripos). He was called
to the Bar in November. ’23, and thereafter
was lawyer to the College and University
Settlement in South London. Prominent in
sport at King’s and at Caius, he was a
member of the Cambridge swimming team
in ’23. An elder brother is a doctor in
Sydney and another is in the wool business.
Rainbow thinks that N. S. Wales is the best
place (inter alia) to pursue briefs. G. H.
Reed, another Cantab, man, who is a Tas-
manian, is coming with him.
“Galleryite”: The late William Hutchin-
son, when Minister of Lands, was introduc-
ing a bill authorising Melbourne City Coun-
cil to take the old West Melbourne Ceme-
tery site for Paddy’s Market extensions. The
Corporation, he said, had reached a dead-end.
“And,” interjected a critic ironically, “you
propose to give it authority to leave no stone

A GENERAL FAVORITE.
THE LIDY: “ Don't yer find yer job makes
yer unpopular?”
THE DEBT-COLLECTOR: “It don’t seem like
it. Why, often and often, they asks me
ter call again.”
P rom Arnold Weinliolt, big-game hunter :
Having read “Macquarie Street’s” article, may ],
without appearing to ire invidious, make a little
criticism of his natural history? He writes of a
S’African “Bushman” following a honey-bird “with
incredible swiftness” an “unbelievable distance.” I
know the Bushmen of s.-e. Angola (Portuguese West
Africa) very well, having been into their country, and
having had these primitive little men as hunting
companions on a number of trips. The African
honey-bird (Swahili ndegi ya salt —bird of the
honey) closely resembles our ordinary black and
white wagtail, though it is perhaps somewhat bigger ;
but, far from flying off “with incredible swiftness,”
he will deliberately come up to any party, halting
or in camp, and by chattering try to attract atten-
tion. If you are in camp some of your natives are
sure to ask permission to follow the bird. It flies
ahead from tree to tree, and, though scolding you for
your slowness, is deliberately guiding vou to a
“sugar-bag” near or far. When that, goal is
reached he stops, chattering in excitement, till the
hive is located. The natives say—no doubt it is
merely a fanciful idea of theirs—that if no honey
is left for the little guide, next time he will lead
you to a snake or leopard or “something bad.”
Regarding the Bushmen’s eyesight, their remark-
able vision is to a great extent used on the sand
ahead of them; for in their dry sand veldt forest
tracks mean and show so much. The Bushmen have
of course excellent general sight as well, though one
finds when hunting with them that these primitive
little men cannot really see more than you can:
what they have is the power and skill to notice,
say, a drop of blood on the spoor, which you can see
just as plainly once they have pointed it out to
you. Frequently a Bushman will stop and point
out to you an animal standing quite still in the
bush, which, trying your hardest, you just cannot
make out, though your little guide points and
gesticulates in frantic excitement alongside you. Sud-
denly—that is, if the animal hasn’t meanwhile bolted
-—the whole of its outline, just as in a puzzle
picture, seems to stand out clear to your eyes too.
The Bushmen always keep a keen lookout for vul-
tures on the trees or circling close to the ground,
for this may often mean a lion’s kill, by which
they get probably most of their meat; but I have
never seen them gazing up to the vultures at a
height: it is when these very useful but disgusting-
looking birds have obviously found something below
that the Bushman is interested.
* * * *
“AdeL”: Why do writers and poets wear
their pen-nibs in libelling the chant of curlews as
“a mournful wail”? Some of these birds, notably
the great sea-curlew, found throughout the North,
may be ranked with the best of our feathered
musicians. No one who has listened to them when
in the small hours of the morning they pour out their
carols can have failed to observe how sweet and
melodious they are. The first note is harsh, but is
always followed by a series of clarinet-like notes.
* * * •
“Mako” : I know of nothing more amazing
than the Glowworm Grotto in the Waitomo Caves,
near Auckland (M.L.). A small boat is launched
on the underground river (Waitomo means “hidden
water”), and by means of a wire is negotiated through
the long grotto, whose walls and roof are studded with
millions of points of emerald light. The creatures
are not glowworms, but tiny threads that hang
fringe-like from every point, each thread with a
luminous end. The effect of this phosphorescent light
reflected in the black water is wonderful and gives
the effect of some jewelled cavern from the “Arabian
Nights.” No talking is permitted; the vibration
will cause a sudden patch of darkness; even a
whispered conversation will blot out large areas of
the lights. Scientists have studied the grotto, but
nobody has yet satisfactorily explained the illumi-
nation, which is, of course, a tremendous asset to
the Tourist Department.
* * * *
“Stooks”: There is a shrub with a small
white flower growing on the far-west coast of Eyre
Peninsula (S.A.) and along the Great Australian
Bight very like “Spike’s” “mother jumper” (B.
27/11/’24). It burns when quite green, and che
first match will light it. We know it locally as
the kerosene bush. It grows very close to the sea,
on top of the high granite cliffs. I have not seen
any further back from the sea than a couple of
hundred- yards.
* * * *
“Up Top” : During a recent heat wave in
North Queensland a girl friend of mine got either
sunstroke or heatstroke in a queer way. After a
long drive she was violently sick. Next morning on
endeavoring to walk to the door she found she was
walking away from it. All her efforts of will were
of no avail ; her legs absolutely persisted in taking
her in the opposite direction to that which she
wanted to go, and for a month it was the same.
A mate of mine possessed hair of which he was
very proud: a thick, crinkly, curly brown mop. A
morning came ‘when as he was sluicing his head
the hair came away like a wig, and he was down
with heatstroke. Four months later his hair re-
grew, in dirty-looking patches. A bad sunstroke
generally comes suddenly, and with paralysis in-
variably. The temperature rises and a man is either
-dead or better within a few days. In heatstroke the
attack may come gradually, and rarely with any
marked rise in temperature, but is always accom-
panied by headache and giddiness and with pains and
cramp in the body. If a man gets violently delirious
and then becomes unconscious, he may be dead in a
few days if his luck is out. First-aid is to loosen
all clothes immediately and remove the patient to
the coolest place possible with the head low; then
douche the head, neck and face with cold water.
In cases of severe collapse, artificial respiration is
necessary. Put the patient to bed in a dark room,
and then, if the doctor can’t fix him, the undertaker
will.
* * * *
“Jesmond”: Foxes are fond of a varied
menu. The following were found recently in a
burrow on Phillip Island (Vic.); a kitten, rat,
thrush, black-duck, seven rabbits, and a small
stingray, as well as a heap of bones. That foxes
fish is a fact. Some weeks ago I was fortunate
enough to see one doing it. It was low tide and
he was almost breast-high in the water. He stood
perfectly still, evidently waiting for a fish to come
near him, for now and then he would make a jab
with his paw. Eventually, after fully half an hour,
he made a stroke, immersed his head, brought up
a fish, and came leaping ashore. Unfortunately,
gathering dusk and the speed of the fox prevented my
distinguishing what kind of fish it, was, but cer-
tainly it was not a ’raj’.
* * * *
“Jarrah”: When I was in charge of a
Group Settlement area in South Westralia I saw a
crow with head and neck completely white. His
mates objected to his company, and when he dropped
on a tree where his black brothers were having a
yarn they immediately left in disgust. I watched
for some time his vain attempts to fraternise, and
became convinced that he was ostracised by the
Black Brotherhood.
“Trevdee”: How is this for an energetic
man? He is a farmer—of course. Grows wheat in
N. Victoria for profit and trains 14 greyhounds for a
hobby. During the coursing season, which is in
winter, he gets up at 4 a.m. daily, and in pitch
darkness walks his dogs until 6.30; then he feeds
12 horses, milks one cow, and separates her milk
THE DEAD FINISH.
MRS. MAGINNIS: “Th’ doctors do be holdin’ a phost-martim on poor Rafferty.”
MRS. DOOLEY “Faith, Oi didn’t think a po or. delicate malm loike him cud sthand wan.”
before getting his own breakfast. After his meal he
puts in the farmer’s usual busy, strenuous day, until
sundown (say 6.30). After this: Feeds the horses,
feeds the dogs (a long job), milks the cow, gets
his own tea. Following tea he finds something to
do around the house until about 10 p.m., when he
sets oif exercising the dogs once more and reaches
bed close on midnight. In the summer he lets the
dogs go, but his hours of labor then are even longer
than in winter.
“Pick” : On the Bibbenkike Closer Settle-
ment (N.S.W.) a solitary bird unknown to that region
made such vicious attacks on lambing flocks early last
summer that it earned the curses of the settlers.
It tore eyes from recumbent ewes and tongues from
bleating lambs, and drew more unproductive shots
from the ordnance of the area than all the crows
on the runs. Bird-traps and poison it shunned
religiously. Its visits were generally made in the
early dawn when the settlement was asleep. It
was a raven in form, slaty-blue in color, and had
the darting and speedy flight of a chicken hawk.
Can any of the Council give it a name?
'/■ * # *
“Tamornie”: I had an albino boy in a
plantation gang in New Ireland, but had to discharge
him, as he suffered so much from the effects of sun-
burn. Later, travelling down the coast on the same
island, near Lemusmuss I met him again, and he
brought out for my inspection his brother and two
sisters, all albinos. The father and mother were
normal natives.
* * * *
“Videlicet”: Although Australia is so close
to Asia, and the seas between are so plentifully
sprinkled with islands, there is a remarkable differ-
ence between the fauna of the two continents. Par-
ticularly is this so in the case of birds, which would,
of course, find no difficulty in crossing the narrow
seas. A narrow strait (15 miles in width) separates
the fertile islands of Bali and Lombok, and this strait
forms a line of demarkation extraordinarily definite.
The bulbuls, barbets, vultures and pheasants so
common in Southern Asia are not found south of
this strait. On the Australian side the difference
in species is most marked in the rhea (emu), honey-
suckers, thick-headed shrikes, kingfishers and mopokes.
I have never heard this division accounted for.
Perhaps someone has an explanation or a theory.
“T.K.T.”: “Toby 0.” (B. 18/12/’24) is
quite right—steWed ’possum can be good tucker.
The trouble is there are ’possums and ’possums.
Going from Barrow 'Greek across to Wave Hill, we
were living chiefly on salt camel —which, by the way,
is so much better than it sounds that one wonders
at it not being used more. ’Possums, very plentiful
in some of the country we passed through, were
splendid eating. Last year I tackled them ip
Central Queensland, near Mount Cooton. Young,
old and middle-aged, they were all no good to me,
and I’m not faddy when hungry. By the way, I
struck Wave Hills at Calfish out-station and, travelling
down to the head station, was wondering how the
place got the name. When within a short distance
of the station the road dips steeply from the “top”
towards the Victoria River, and the name was ex-
plained. The riverside is most curiously terraced
limestone. One could hardly imagine a more
striking imitation of sea waves.
“Eve II.” : Have any of the Council met
a musical frog? Driven to refuge by a dry spell,
a frog took up his residence in our kitchen, where
he indulges in a nightly bath in a dish of water
intended to baffle the ants in their attack upon the
sugar-basin. His taste for music \Vas discovered
when a new record was being tried on the grainu-
phone. We heard a “flop,” “flop,” and saw that
froggie had left his make-believe pond for tne
sitting-room, where he squatted in the most homely
manner on the table. . When the playing ceased
he became restive, but assumed an air of acute
attention when the music again started. Twice
now he has responded to the call of the music, and
until the drought breaks a watch will be kept to
see if he continues to do so.
* * * *
“Troopliorse’s Sire”: Inform “Wai Hoi”
(B. 4/12/’24) that,'as buffalo cows have calves and
the migration westward has been going on for many
years, a few old bulls are doubtless westward too.
As far back as the ’eighties, long before the advent
of “Troophorse,” I rode the tracks of what I thought
must be a bull buffalo on the west side of the Ord
River, but they ended in an outsize in bullocks.
I never saw a buffalo west of the Victoria River,
though I admit the possibility. They could cross
above the depot, but mostly they hang between the
Daly and Fitzmaurice rivers.
DIDN’T KNOW SHE WAS IN.
POLITE OLD GENT. ( collecting eggs ): “Oh,
or — I beg your pardon!”
“Sucre”: “Nitric’s” new fruit, the paw-
paw banana (B. 18/12/’24), is nearly as ancient
as the dodo. Thirty years ago we had a pawpaw
tree in our garden at Toowong (Q.) that bore
banana-shaped fruit for three years. The nearest
banana plant was in the back yard of the late Robert
Philp’s home 100 yards distant. The fruit was seed-
less and had a faint and vague banana taste. The
passion-fruit banana, so well known to Sydney and
other suburbs of Australia, is really an echo of the
other vegetable sausage.

“Buttenderry”: “Spenner’s” old-timer (B.
18/12/’24) slips badly when he asserts that free
straight-grained posts will outlast the tough cross-
grained ones. The former, owing to the very fact
that they are free, will split and crack slightly on
their own account under the action of the weather,
thereby exposing a greater surface to the wind and
rain, also providing suitable cover for white ants,
dry rot, etc. Moreover, they will fall ready victims
in a bush fire. The tough, cross-grained variety
present a solid front to the elements, and will easily'
outlast the other kind. The tough ’uns for me—
provided someone else does the splitting.
“Up Top”: “Mary Scott” (B. 18/12/’24)
need not fear that her mango-trees when in fruit
w’ill bring fleas about; having lived the last 10 years
in luxuriant mango country I am convinced there is
nothing in the superstition. Incidentally, does
“Mary Scott” know that if she peels her mangoes,
cuts the flesh into thin strips, and sun-dries for a few
days, the fruit will last in the same way as dried
apples and apricots? The housewives of Cooktown
fatten their husbands on mango pie long after the
tree is bare. It is unnecessary, no doubt, to remind
a girl of the North that mango chutney puts “pep”
into a man, as also does pie, and, far more so does
mango wine.
CIRCUMVENTING ’EM.
“What soort av time ded ’ce ’awe down ’long town-way?”
“'E wadden so had, hut the crowds was turrible. I ’ad to
go 'round ’em for to get through.”
“8.5. A. ”: I’ll back the scorpion as the in-
sect Dempsey of Australia. Recently the expert of
the Perth Museum staged a contest between a large
centipede and an average-sized scorp. The latter
beat the other with ease. In the north-west of South
Aus. it is a favorite pastime to match scorpions with
other insects, but it is rather tame, as the contest
is soon over —Scorp. the winner. Two of equal
weight make a good match, with a long run
for your money. Catching the fighters requires prac-
tice, as they sometimes delve into the soil to a
depth of nearly 20in., descending circuitously.
Medium-sized scorpions of about 34in. are the
quickest in the ring, but occasionally Sin. specimens
are found and rank as champions in the heavyweight
class.
“Gouger”: There is little doubt that some
tribes among the Cape York Peninsula niggers
smoked long before Raleigh’s day. They sun-dry the
leaves of a large spreading tree, fill them into a long
tube rolled out of a broad green jungle leaf, and then
smoke them cigar fashion. The smoker, however,
does not exhale the smoke, but blows it into a hollow
bamboo in which a mouth-hole is bored. When the
THE RETURN OF THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTER.
bamboo is full of smoke it is passed round the
squatting circle, each buck taking a long draw at
the mouthpiece; then, placing his thumb over the
orifice, he passes the bamboo to the next man. The
leaves must have some strong drug properties, because
the smokers soon become very stupid, and are often
badly burned through rolling, whilst insensible, into
the camp-fire coals. Many of the frightfully-scarred
men and women of the coastal tribes got their dis-
figurement thus.
* * * *
“8.5. A.” : A few miles north of Blinman
(S.A.) I noticed two eagles trying to get a hare.
The animal had evaded two darts from the fliers,
and gained the protection of a wire fence. This lie
was working along, and his attackers narrowly
escaped injuries trying to seize him. When opposite
a clump of scrub, the hare decided to make a dive
for more substantial cover. The two eagles evidently
thought they were on a winner when the hare took
to the open, but the little chap’s dodging and
stopping was a treat, and he escaped talons and
beaks and gained the scrub.
* * * *
“Gouger”: Some Cape York Peninsula
tribes catch small fish with the help of a large
spider, which spins its big
web on the edge of dense
jungle. It owns a large
belly with a waistcoat of
green sprinkled with bright
gold dots. The skirt is
glossy black suede, the
mandibles powerful and
brilliantly red. Its long black
legs sport bangles of gold.
Its web is very strong and
golden-green in color. In
such a trap I saw the
pathetic remains of a tiny
fan-tailed bird. The spider
is not at all coy, is fear-
less and nastily ferocious
when in the tantrums, and
I am ashamed to say keeps
no less than six wretchedly
meek husbands, very ugly
little fellows, leading a
lonely and extremely insecure
life on the furthest out-
skirts of their beautiful
mistress’s web. The nigger
takes a light switch and
twitches the big web around
its point into a hanging
thread about 3ft. long. The
spider is squashed and the
end of the strand moistened
in its body. The strand at
the stick end is then trailed
in the water, and some
essence, I suppose from the
spider’s crushed body,
quickly attracts small fish.
These bite the web strand,
their needle-like teeth bc-
come entangled in the
strong mesh, and with a quick flip of the wrist they
are jerked ashore.

“Te W.”: "A kind of flour resembling
arrowroot can be made from the nuts of the cyoas
palm as well as from those of the burrawang (zamia),
but soaking in water and pounding is necessary

flour was scarce and very dear, used to prepare a
fair substitute from the burrawang nuts (orange-
scarlet when dead-ripe), pressing the white meat
inside the shell through sieves after soaking. It
was then dried in an oven.
“R.J.T”: “W.P.T.” (B. 4/12/’24) says
that double-yolked eggs, whether the fruit of hens,
ducks or any' other bird, are never fertile, and if set
under a hen she will recognise them and push them
out of the nest, because ‘‘hens don’t sit on eggs
for fun.” What about the old hen which sits on
china or wooden eggs, or even a round door knob ?
Ev,n if she is sitting on a genuine egg she will
continue on the job till it becomes addled and explodes
under her. Yet “W.P.T.” would have us believe
that the average biddy can tell a fertile egg from
an infertile one! As a matter of fact, doublc-
yolked eggs may be fertile. A double-yolked egg is
simply due to the fact that two yolks in the cluster
became ripe or developed about the same time and
fell into the mouth of the oviduct shortly after each
other, thereby becoming enclosed in the one shell
after being surrounded by the white and the mem-
brane. An egg is fertilised some days before it is
laid. The germ, as it may be termed, is in a Cell
in the yolk. Double-yolked eggs seldom hatch,
and when they do the result is more or less Siamese
twin chickens. As the yolk is the only part of the
egg which is duplicated, there cannot be two blood
systems to nourish the embryos ; hence death or the
joining of the two embryos.

“Olive”: The other day I was watching a
lizard, about 3in. long, running about on a wall,
when a red-backed spider pounced on it. The
struggle was short, the lizard being a corpse in less
than a minute. Is this a usual occurrence, or was
Mrs. Red-back just narked over something?
* * # *
“Herodot”: A bullock slaughtered recently
at Manildra (N.S.W.) was found to contain in its
stomach and adjoining parts 53 pieces of iron, tin,
nuts, bolts, screws and nails, and a length of
twisted barbed wire that was 21in. long. Most
of the articles were in the beast’s stomach, but a
few of them had worked through the walls of that
organ, apparently without causing any injury or
discomfort, and had found their way into the peri-
toneal space. The bullock when killed was in prime
condition, and as it had spent practically the whole
of its life in grazing paddocks, the source of its
supply is something of a mystery.
* * * *
“Cartot”: Despite popular opinion to the
contrary, the half-caste child frequently surpasses
all others in point of intelligence, powers of ordi-
nary observation, and ability to learn. Some tests
recently carried out amongst the pupils of about 30
schools in a N. S. Wales school inspectorate which
includes numerous half-caste and full-blooded aborigi-
nal children disclosed that in seven schools half-
castes were at the top of their classes in different
subjects, while in nine others they were close to it.
Over the whole area they scored far the best average
in proportion to their numbers; white children
came next, those of pure aboriginal blcod being a
very bad third. The same thing lias been noted in
schools in other parts of the Commonwealth; every
prize in one W.A. school was recently won by the
despised half-castes.
* * * #
“C. Coral”: When a Torres Strait lady
is in an interesting condition she has to be particu-
larly careful lest, in moving round, she transgress
native custom and bring bad luck to the household.
She must not touch a bundle of grass when a house
is being re-roofed; should she do so the supply of
thatching is likely to run short. She must not venture
into the stone fish-trap to spear fish, or nothing
more will be caught for weeks; and if a turtle should
happen to see her, then it’s good-bye to the chance
of turtle-soup on the menu for a long time. Her
husband also has to be cautious, and should be
careful not to touch the stones of the fish-weir during
the time the little stranger is expected, or again
there will be bad luck.
* * * *
“1.L.1.”: Some Cape York Peninsula
tribes believe that, should a woman visit certain
“spirit” localities, a spirit child, which has been
awaiting a mother from perhaps untold ages, will
enter into her. The greater number believe in re-
incarnation, and that in the next life the sexes will
be reversed. Practically every nigger, if you get
his confidence, will tell you that he is so-and-so, who
had been born many times before. Some can trace
themselves back for centuries. Besides his own
“earth” name every nigger has a totem name, gen-
erally of some animal or plant. In many tribes
it is taboo for a man to eat his totem animal as
food. They are very secretive as to the totem
name, believing that, should a malicious witch-doctor
get hold of it, he could so influence the totem that
the man’s spirit would wander hopelessly seeking in
the spirit world his totem friend. (Should he not
find this friend he can never be reborn to earth life
again.) Although the aboriginal can hardly be said
to have a religion, he lives in a vast spirit
world. Everything that happens by day or night
that he cannot understand is the work of a “spirit.”
And almost all these spirits are bad. There are
very few good ones. Through all the tribes there is
a dim belief that “Something” made everything, even
the spirits. But whether this Something is good or
bad I have never been able to And out. The
aborigine is astonishingly fearful of talking even
in the lowest tone to the most trusted white man
about this Something, and, if he does breathe a
word about it, will invariably glance fearfully over
his shoulder, even in broad daylight, as he tells
the tale.
“Speculum”: “Videlicet’s” paragraph on
the amors of insects will not be questioned by any
well-informed naturalist. The phenomenon he de-
scribes is due to (1) the vitality of insect tissues,
which is much greater than that of the higher ani-
mals, and (2) to the capacity of insect nerve ganglia
to function independently of one another. If “Vide-
licet” is ever fortunate enough to witness the nup-
tials of the mantis, he may observe the pleasant ways
of an insect vamp who, not content with the pleasures
of love, takes her wedding breakfast at the expense
of her companion. He, true to the reproductive in-
stinct, completes his love-making even though his
voracious mistress has eaten large portions of his
body, frequently including the head. The explana-
tion lies in the fact that the abdominal ganglion of
an insect can continue its control of the part it
supplies with nerves even when it is severed from
the brain or cervical ganglia.
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum”: “Sylvester’s” queer
reptile, found in S.-E. Queensland (B. 4/12/’24), is
probably the Eastern slow-worm ( Cryptodelma orient-
a lie). All the slow-worm family, of which there
are many members, can readily be known by two
pairs of immature legs, which, take no part in loco-
motion, and by the great brittleness of the tail. As
they live beneath logs, etc., they are not often met
with, unless when turning up the ground by plough-
ing or digging. The Eastern slow-worm is not nearly
as large as the common slow-worm (Pygopus lepi-
dopus), which attains a length of about 2ft. The
creatures are quite harmless, though very snake-
like in appearance.
* * * *
“Fitz”: The late John Allan, of Kimbriki,
near Wingham (N.S.W.), knew as much about the
early blacks on the Central North Coast of his State
as most men—and the blacks knew John. John went
up to a “cabra ground” on the Little Dingo Creek
one day, leaving his horse tied up a short distance
away. There was no one about the “ring,” and as it
looked clean and inviting, with its carpet of gum
leaves, he sauntered in. He had been standing there
some little time, viewing the “fireplace,” when an
abo. known as Gohanna happened along. The old
chap appeared to be both surprised and annoyed when
he saw Allan. His annoyance was attributed to the
carelessness of the other blacks in leaving the “cabra
ground” unguarded. Shortly afterwards two black-
fellows came up, and were severely reprimanded by
Gohanna. Allan’s horse was feeding at the time on
a space exposed to the view of the aboriginal women
who had gathered in the vicinity, and 1 the old man
sent one of the abos. to remove the horse from their
sight. When Allan was leaving (and he did not
waste any time making a move), two strapping abos.
were instructed to see him well out of sight of the
cabra ground; and they would not allow him to
DRIVEN TO IT.
“I suppose drink brought you to this?”
“It did, lady—the leant of it!”
mount his horse till he had got well into the scrub.
A day or two later Allan was working not very far
distant from this historic ground of the blacks, and had
with him an abo. known as Paddy. They were cross-
cutting a log, and had the saw about halfway through
it, when suddenly they heard the “bull-roarer” going
at the cabra ground. Paddy looked up quickly, ceased
to push his end of the saw, and exclaimed: “Coco,
Coco, John. You hear him? Tocal coore bungi fa
lot of blacks cornel. I must go.” And he went.
Allan didn’t see Paddy for many days. Such -were
the mysteries of the race.
A BALLAD OP BEER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“In many towns the most imposing building is a
temple of beer while you will find that the church
is in a back street.”
All of the gods a seven have thrown;
Only their shadows or names remain;
Faith in devils man has outgrown,
They' torture no more the human brain;
Those gods were mostly devils in grain—
Never a cult of them long stayed pure.
Yet we rejoice in deities twain—
The temples of Venus and Bacchus endure.
Let theologians make sad moan.
Can they one of their creeds explain?
Where are the gods of Olympus flown?
Doth Jehovah or Allah reign?
(Mankind disagrees there again !)
Can Odin, Osiris, or Buddha cure
The ache for knowledge? In vain, in vain!
Still the temples of Venus and Bacchus endure.
Charlatans thrive on the Great Unknown;
Some close friendship with gods will feign.
Some promise that perishing flesh and bone
Shall conquer nature, and death, and pain,
That even the systems shall wax and wane
Ere man and his Earth-planet obscure
Vanish... .ah, let us our minds regain:
Still the temples of Venus and Bacchus endure!
Envoy.
Mates, though wine be the preacher’s bane
And women the celibate would immure,
Join with me in the joyous strain:
Still the temples of Venus and Bacchus endure!
QUEENSLAND.

Why MOTORISTS
should buy from Garages!
# * *
The first place a motorist makes for when in trouble—or short of fuel
supplies—is the nearest garage or motor workshop. When away from
home—the carist looks for and anticipates “service” in almost every
settled part of this country. He accepts “service” and pays for it—and
goes his way—giving little thought as to how that garage exists or
happened to be on the roadside—ready to render him or her service. A
little thought will bring home to motorists the reason of the above
heading. In the first place—the support of local motorists—usually
provides the necessary income upon which “service stations” are founded
and subsist. The sale of bread and butter lines—such as tyres, petrol,
oil, etc., goes a long way towards helping to keep the “doors open”—hot
only to local, but passing motorists, who are usually only too ready to
accept “service” when needed. In this connection motoring is made more
pleasurable, more certain, and more profitable by the existence of
thousands of garages or motor houses throughout the length and breadth
of Australia. Every motor car and motor cycle owner owes a duty to
“service stations”—and that duty lays in bestowing your patronage on
the men who are always ready to help you. Buy your tyres, fuel, etc.,
from garages and thus help them to be in a position to render you that
service which is much appreciated in times of trouble. The Dunlop policy
has always been to support trade houses so that they in turn may exist
to attend to motorists’ needs. The distribution of motor tyres should—
in our opinion—go through motor houses and garages. It is the
legitimate channel for tyre and fuel supplies—in fact, its more—
it is the only channel that fair minded motorists should support.
In Australia there are nearly 5000 garages that stock popular sizes of

Carnival was king at Carlyon’s and the
Oriental on New Year’s Eve, and as the
witching hour of midnight struck, social dis-
tinctions were forgot: shingled stenographers
joined hands with waiters to sing the old
year out. Two bands of light-footed girl
dancers, whom Jennie Brenan coached, glad-
dened Carlyon’s evening with a couple of
sparkling ballets, and the Oriental’s rooms
were garlanded with pink and mauve flowers
under flights of bright-colored butterflies.
It seemed as if everybody left in the met-
ropolis had sacrificed their beauty sleep to
cheer the arrival of little 1925. Each after
his own fashion; some offered thanks in
prayer and some in jazz and some on tuneful
hooters and kerosene-tins. Golfing Sandring-
ham essayed the Continental style with a
beach carnival and a confetti battle at mid-
night on a sea-front that assailed the ocean
with a thousand spears of light.
Mrs. Russell Jackson and her sister, Mrs.
Teddy Dyson, filled in New Year’s night
cheerfully for special friends with an even-
ing party in their old St. Kilda home, which
they now share with their parents, the
Arthur Boyes. The old schoolroom resounded
to scraping heels and the best parlor to music,
and a perfectly wonderful midnight supper,
spread in the big dining-room, lasted into
the small hours. Mrs. Jackson equatored
a misty raven frock with furlongs of pink
corals that once grew on some South Sea
atoll. Mrs. Teddy, who had her husband
to help look after the guests, starred angeli-
cally, on the musical side, in a black frock
which showed up her lily fairness. Amongst
the invited were Col. and Mrs. Mclnerney
and daughter Aileen, the Duncan Macpher-
sons, the Monty Grover pair, Dr. Leon
Jona, Dr. Norman MacArthur, City Organist
Price and his wife, the Dyers and daughter
Mardie and General Johnston.
When Governor O’Grady arrived in Tas-
mania Administrator Nicliolls was not avail-
able to welcome him or to swear him in. As
the surgeons had just done something serious
to the appendix of the Chief Justice and
declined to let him up, the O’Grady was in-
stalled by Judge Crisp. And no sooner had
Crisp. J., seen that the O’Grady had well
and truly kissed the book than a waiting
dentist seized him. Thus it happened as
never before that at the new Governor’s first
public reception there was no Judge to
trail a robe across the landscape, Ewing, the
third man, being still away on sick leave.
Governor O’Grady, of the Speck, took
possession of Government House on Christ-
mas Eve, and, accompanied by his daughter,
was ushered into a special stall at high mass
at: St. Mary’s Cathedral on Christmas morn-
ing. Replying afterwards to the usual loyal
addresses "at the Town Hall, the O’Grady let
it be inferrel that he had taken on the vice-
regal job in a spirit of adventure and was
ready to stand the consequences. He would
make mistakes, he supposed, as he wasn’t
used to the game, but, etc., etc. Hobart
votes the new Governor genial and unassum-
ing, and bound to be popular. It has been
arranged that Mrs. Kerr-Cameron, the elder
O’Gr.vdy daughter, shall be chatelaine at the
vice-regal residence. Her husband, who was
“on the land” in Tasmania for a year or two
after the war, is an officer on a P. and O.
liner, and may join the family at an early
date.
The James Angus pair beckoned a big
gathering into their South Yarra home to
help them see the New Year in in true Scot-
tish style. A specially selected supper forti-
fied the guests, both before and after mid-
night, the food being preluded with music and
epilogued with jazz. Mrs. Angus’s beautiful
singing yoice, which had not been heard since
the terrible accident which robbed her hus-
band of his eyesight, was released once more
in a Scottish duet with Duncan Macpherson’s
fine baritone. Big Neville Towne, as “first-
footer." brought a glass of whusky. a piece of
shortbread and some coal for the master
of the house. Colonel Maclnerney, in voicing
the company's good wishes for the host, and
his wife, drew the eyes of everyone to the
grandfather clock under the stairs, which for
200 years struck the hours in the old Angus
home at Auchterader, Perthshire, before re-
suming two years ago its loud and accurate
"tic-toc” in its new Melbourne home. Addie
Markwell helped her aunt and uncle to see
that everyone was happy. Amongst the revel-
lers were Wellington Carrington, the Duncan
Macpherson pair, the Archie Whites, Dr.
and Mrs. Cust, Mrs. Maclnerney and daugh-
ter Aileen and Colonel Moseley. Arthur
Bishop brought his picturesquely-robed Cxnga-
lee “boy” to help hand the supper dishes. He
had risen to the occasion by fluttering a wide
length of loud tartan ribbon on lus little per-
son, just above his scarlet cummeibund.
A spasm of sunshine, offering feminine
punters a belated chance of airing fluttering
organdies, beckoned a big crowd to the
Moonce Valley racecourse. One millinery
triumph, with playing-cards instead ot flowers
wreathing its roof, held up the eye traffic
wherever it appeared. Mrs. H. O. Nevitt,
from Ballarat, was introducing her dad,
Lord Airedale, who recently dropped in from
England with his wife, to his first Aussie
race-meeting.
Drs. Devine and Hamilton-Russell have
returned from the American Congress ot
Surgeons full of enthusiasm for the Com-
munity Hospital system, in which the rich
patients, so to speak, pay for the poor, a
scheme which isn’t likely to appeal to Mrs.
Toorak and Mrs. South Yarra who like to
swank about the expensive private hospitals
which shelter them in their various illnesses.
The latest trans-Atlantic craze, say the re-
turning medicoes, is the palatial structure,
half hospital half hotel, where friends of
the patient can board and be near the in-
valids. Dr. Devine rubbed home the truth
that Australians do not take a sufficient
interest in research which would help us_ to
improve the health of the community with-
out waiting till it qualified for the hospitals.
A visiting Englishman, Philip Beaumont
Vaughan, will carry off one of Brighton’s
best-liked girls, Dorothy Adamson, when he
steams back to his homeland at the end
of the present year. The two first met when
the youthful Dorothy was tripping across
seas under the wing of her mother, who is
the widow of the late C. Adamson of the
local House of Landlords and member of
a former State Ministry. The orange blos-
soms and confetti will not be ordered until
August.
Colonel and Mrs. Tim Mclnerney arc
carrying their 17-year-old daughter. Aileen to
England to reintroduce her to her English
relatives, and will take her ashore in S’Africa
on the way to give her a peep at her native
soil. The trio were farewelled by Dr. Nihill
and the Russell-Jackson, Hidgcock and Wool-
cott matrons with a night out at Old Admi-
ralty House. The star guest’s svelte figure
was sheathed with gold, and a shower of pre-
sentation roses and hydrangeas nodded in her
hand. Aileen was a picture of rose-white
youth, with a golden plait hanging down the
back of a jade-green frock fringed with
white fur. In the gathering was Mrs.
Russell Gabb, who is herself entangled in a
web of farewell parties.
Moscovitcli’s leading lady, Jean Robert-
son, whose expressive face is portrayed in
this Broothorn picture, was born and bred
among the S’Australian gum-trees. She is
the* one mummer the family tree has grown,
and her talent found its first expression in
the Adelaide Repertory co. Her parents
frowned at a
stage career,
and Jea n
might still be
an amateur but
for a chance
visit to Mel-
bourne. George
W illoughby
tempted her to
cross the pro-
fessional foot-
lights, a n d
later Julius
Knight pro-
moted her to
leading parts.
W a r condi-
tions sent Jean
to N’Yo r k,
where her
name soon glit-
tered over the
entrance way
of big theatres
below those of Lou Tellegen and George
Arliss. Homesickness brought .lean from
London on a visit to her own people, and she
was just reloading her trunks when (he
Firm invited her to stay and star with Mos-
covitch. Like all good Aussie girls Jean
is a keen sport, and never so happy as when
in the saddle.
The walls of Castlemaine’s Art Museum
are well if modestly papered with works by
some of Australia's best-known painters.
The latest addition is Longstaff’s portrait of
ex-Premier Lawson, unveiled by Baldwin
Spencer, who patted Castlemaine on the back
for the fine quality of its collection. Only
local art-lovers know the uphill fight it has
been to get them. For some years a group
of citizens dadoed the walls of a hired room
with pictures they paid for out of their own
pockets. The foundations of a gallery have
now been laid with, among others, a brace
of hundred-pound cheques from John Hig-
gins and one for 30-odd pounds from the
Borough Council.
The cheerfulness of the John Tail, family’s
Christmas was badly singed by a fire which
burst from the innards of their motor-car as
they were oiling happily down to Portsea
to put in the hot weeks by the salt waves.
The disaster might have been chronicled
under the dailies’ special holiday headline,
“Motor Fatalities,” but for the promptitude
of John Tait in smothering the flames with
a rug while he rescued the women and
children. The little party then stood help-
lessly by watching their trunkloads of clothes
and Christmas gifts go up in smoke. Among
the burnt offerings was an expensive necklet
belonging to Mrs. Tait.
Western District wool flooded Camper-
down on Boxing Day, for Tennis Tourna-
ment Week. The terrific downpour which
robbed the Melbourne crowds of their holi-
day struck the district less heavily, and the
opening set bounced off at 3 instead of 9
in the morning. The onlookers shivered till
nightfall, when the committee allowed them
to warm themselves with jazz at the local
hall. The Jack Manifolds filled in the Satur-
day night with a fox trotting frivol at their
Purrumbete homestead, where Mrs. C. Mani-
fold’s amateur band supplied the noise.

“Doll’s House” and Elizabeth in “Lilies of
the Field.” Miss Kook has an equal flair
for comedy and drama, and her fine mezzo
voice makes her elocution a delight to listen
to. Fruling made the picture.
Mr. and Mrs. E. M. Sturges landed back
from England the other day, and are shelter-
ing with the lady’s brother and sister-in-law,
John and Lady Grice, at Mount Mace-
don. This is their first time back in the
gum-trees since they left as bride and bride-
groom. Mr. Sturges was here some years
ago as tutor to the son of a previous Vic-
torian Governor, Henry Loch.
A. 11. Aslibolt’s K.B. didn’t come as a
surprise to the inhabitants of the Speck.
Although a Maorilander, Ashbolt has been
in Hobart for over 30 years, having gone
there in his early twenties. He first joined
the IXL jam firm as accountant, afterwards
becoming business manager and a director.
Since 1919 he had been pushing the interests
of the islanders as Agent-General in London.
He was the first layman to get that crust
of retired politicians.
The vice-regal Stradbrokes have been con-
veying their trio of schoolboy sons to the
pantomime and musical shows. Their third
hope, Keith, has shed his Scots’ College
badge to join the King’s Navee, and goes
back to England on the Nestor. Little
Christopher’s illness still keeps his mother
at his bedside in the daytime.
The Leslie Stuarts’ elder daughter, Nan-
ette, celebrated Yuletide by getting engaged
to a young Gippslander, Fred Gilder, second
hope of the Robert Gilders of Newburn Park,
Maffra. The pair have been fielding a bom-
bardment of congratulations at Portsca, where
the Stuart family are escaping the hot
weather in the water. The bride-elect is a
bright little blonde not yet out of her teens.
William Neil Mclvie, holder of the Charles
scholarship in music and an old Melbourne
Grammar School boy who took his B.A. at
Oxford last year, has just been given the
right to add Mus. Bac. to his name. He is
an old pupil of E. 11. Niekson, and a son of
the vicar of Port Melbourne.
Minnie Everett, who for a generation and
more has been responsible for the training
of the Firm’s ballets in Melbourne, is now
setting up a school for the coaching of opera-
tic dancers. As a girl Miss Everett attended
the Bell-street State school, Fitzroy, where
Alfred Deakin was a student, and Minnie’s
dance was always the principal feature of
the Christmas concert.
The Richard Casey widow is steaming off
shortly to join son Dick in London, where
he has slipped into a place as an Australia
House official. Rumor has it that brother
Dermot, who lately tied up with the Everard
Brownes’ elder daughter, will also be waiting
to welcome his mother back to the great
metropolis; but whether he will just cross
the Atlantic for the purpose of welcoming
the lady or whether he is giving up his job
in Trade Commissioner Elder’s Washington
office, Mrs. Rumor forgets to mention.
Percy Evans, the little hustler who was a
pervading genius in the London Australian
community during the war years, is now in
Melbourne. Diggers who went to the Anzac
Buffet in Victoria-street will remember
Percy, who had an office a few doors away,
and was largely responsible for the organisa-
tion of the committee which ran the affair;
his wife was one of its prominent helpers.
Mr. Hedger, secretary of the Victorian
Blind Institute, has been uncommonly suc-
cessful during his four years of office. Sales
of work by the inmates have increased from
£20,500 to £26,000, and the revenue from
subscriptions and entertainments from £5500
to almost £14,000. Ormond Hall, which was
used as a storeroom for nearly 20 years,
owing to want of funds for its completion, is
now returning £2OOO a year in rent; and the
blind orchestra, which used to dispense its
harmony gratis, is now adding over £lOOO a
year to the funds. When the blind workers
were entertained at dinner by the Board the
other day, £lOOO or thereabouts was dis-
tributed among them as a Christmas bonus.
Mrs. Mary S. Armytage, dead in Melbourne
aged 88, arrived in Victoria with her parents
in 1841. Theirs was one of the few brick
houses in Little Collins-street when it was
known as “Twopenny Row.” The lady mar-
ried F. W. Armytage- in 1859, and one of her
sons —Bertram —accompanied Shackleton to
the Antarctic.
John Amadio, Melbourne’s own flautist, is
covering himself with glory in English
musical ranks. His execution and tone
variety leave the critics dumb, and some
say De Jong never blew as tine a note.
Ernest Turnbull, President of the
Returned Soldiers’ Association, is braced for
a plunge into matrimony with the C. It.
Herschells’ attractive elder daughter, Joyce.
Joyce is a clever ’cello player who has been
treading the Inky Way as social reporter
for one of the weekly journals.
In furtherance of the scheme for present-
ing the widow of Allan Cameron, sometimh
M.L.A. for palhousie, with a suburban home,
a race-meeting is to be held at Kyneton on
January 27. State politicians have contri-
buted close on £2OO towards the fund.
From a musical Australian in London:—
Galli-Curei’s success in this country is, in its way,
wholly unprecedented. For her extra concerts in
the Albert Hall and the Alexandra Palace all seats
of these vast auditoriums are already sold out. The
voice is very beautiful, pure, even liquid. She has
been, so far, too nervous here to do herself justice,
but the people are crazy in their eagerness to hear
her. Owing to excessive use of portamenta, she
sometimes sings a little flat in the succeeding phrase,
wanting proper breath-control. For the rest, she
is easily first of her time. Her London “publicity”
immediately before her debut was badly bungled. It
was developed, at what should have been the soft-
pedal period, into a provocative phase, which was
really a challenge to the critics, and many of them
responded by being zealous in their search for a
fault. This has in no way damped public enthusiasm.
Veteran critics recall that the only bygone debuts io
come at all near it were those of Jenny Lind and
Patti, atid in very recent' times the first London
appearance of Amy Castles. Melba does not come into
this comparison; it may be recalled she was not an
astonishing success during her early London seasons.
Adelaide’s additions:—
Arming itself with floral ammunition, Society
tucked itself into its motors and rushed from
hills and seaside to town for the Opera Co.’s concert.
The stars dressed their characters, but, with nothing
better as a background than the yellow varnish cf
the Town Hall organ and its dingy little red
curtain, the effect wasn’t so alluring after all.
Otherwise it was triumph all the way, especially
for Phyllis Archibald, Piccaluga and Granforte.
Our grey and grizzly summer is making feminine
shoppers wonder if next season a macintosh, gum-
boots and a good sensible umbrella will not be
the most serviceable outfit. However, summer frip-
peries had a look in at Morphettville and topped
themselves with sunshades of every imaginable shape,
size and color. Commemoration Day junketings at
Glenelg divided honors with Port races, but his
Ex. managed to do both and to fit a passing glance
at the Boy Scouts’ camp at Fulham in between.
Of our feminine pioneers, who can compete with
Miss Marianne Fisher, who came here in the Buffalo
in ’36 and has kept in close touch with the country’s
evolution ever since? Her father, the knightly
Hurtle Fisher, was the Colony’s first Commissioner
and its capital’s first Mayor; and through her sister's
marriage to John Morphett she is mixed up with
half the families who helped to make S’Australian
history.
Few ex-viceregents keep the memory of S.A.
greener than the Weignlls. Every Christmas brings
a sheaf of messages from them, not forgetting a
cable to the people for whom she did so much—the
workers at the Royal Institution for the Blind.
The Federal Government’s purchase of the last of
Cobb and Co.’s coaches has started a proposal that
one of the vehicles which used to. link up Kapunda
with Terowie and Broken Hill, when the first-named
town was railhead, should be rescued from the stable
yard at Kapunda, where it is dropping by bits
into oblivion. Sidney Kidman was the contractor
for that ancient service.

Refrigerator Cabinets made to order and machines fitted.
Isko is the most wonderful machine ever designed—only two moving parts, and these work
in oil—no valves, no pistons or rings, no condenser tower. Isko machines are practically
silent.

Dear Sir, — _ , ,
It will be of interest to you to know that the Model
SCO One-Ton Isko Refrigerating Machine which you
supplied to this Hotel in January last is proving an
unqualified success.
It has been in operation now for the past twelve
months, and the Thermostatic control is functioning
perfectly, stopping the machine when the desired
temperature is reached, and re-starting it when the
temperature again rises. The machine carries on
quite automatically, and we have not found it neces-
sary to go near it. , ...
My Chef tells me that he is more than pleased with
the condition of the perishable foodstuffs which the
“ISKO” takes care of, which I attribute to the dry
refrigeration of the “ISKO” as opposed to the cold,
moist air of the old-fashioned ICE Chamber.
Although, as you know, the machine is only about
22 feet from my office, I sometimes do not [l ear lt;
running, as it is very silent in operation. To my
mind, this is a most important feature in my busi-
ness.
Believe me,
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) G. E. MURDOCH,
Manager.

Dear Sir, — ,
In response to your inquiry, I will state that we
purchased our small Isko Refrigerating Machine some
four to five years ago, and it has been working, when
the weather has been at all warm, ever since. As you
know, we use tjhis machine for cooling chocolates, and,
as you may also know, we have at all times over-
loaded our Isko; in fact, our work really calls for a
refrigerator of at least one-half-ton capacity. How-
ever, the Isko has served us up to date.
We consider our Isko a wonderful little machine
and would not consider parting with it, except it
be replaced by a much larger capacity machine. We
have never had any trouble whatever with our Isko.
At a later date we hope to make some improvements
in our Chocolate factory, and hope to find use for
your larger model Isko.
Yours truly,
McKimmin’s Golden Gate Sundae Shops, Etd.

Dear Sir, — _. n „
I have much pleasure in stating that the lbixv
Refrigerating Plant you installed for us some months
ago has been working to our uniform and entire satis-
faction. . . , , ,
The machine is clean, noiseless, and so tar nas
proved 100% efficient, and, moreover, has called for
the minimum of attention on the part of our staff.
We consider it an ideal installation for our busi-
ness, and are highly pleased with our choice of
machine.
Yours faithfully,
For the Hotel Metropole, Etd.,

WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY
Kayser
GIOVES
Real summer breezed into Sydney with
New Year’s Day. She smiled at kilted
Highlanders at the Sports Grounds, and on
the comedy in muslin at Randwick, and laid
a golden hand on the beaches. Never have
Bondi and Coogce sounded a fresher Lorelei
note than in the earliest hours of 1925. One
thought instinctively of Sydney as the girl
in Henley’s poem walking “with the wind and
the sea in her hair.” Curving round the
roads above Watson’s Bay—roads lined with
a blaze of color, and heady with garden
spices stored between low stone walls, sky
and sea like a blue glaze, and the hills a
Titan’s arm flung about the bay’s supple
waist, who envied the exile his iEgean
shores, or his Malaga in Spain? Lustrous
as a pearl, luscious as a sun-warmed nec-
tarine, a shimmer of green and gold as deeply
rooted in the fancy as North Head is rooted
in its rocky fastness, our heritage was flung
before us. He was poor indeed on such a
day who could not find it in his heart to
thank God he was of Australia!
“I’m married 50 years the nicht,” re-
marked a sweet-faced, silver-haired old lady
in an interval of gaily jazzing among the
thousand New Year Eve revellers at the Went-
worth CafG She was Mrs. James Lawson,
of Vaucluse, and she and her Ilieland laddie
were celebrating thojr golden nuptials by
giving a party to children, grandchildren and
friends. A golden basket of golden roses
was presented to the radiant hostess, who
footed it with the best of the young ones.
Her better half was content to sit and watch
the fun, smiling under one of the paper
Glengarry caps that were the chief head-
dress of the night. There was “Auld Lang
Syne,” also, and as many kisses as at the
Artists’ Ball when the clock struck 12. New
fashions came in with the New Year, too, and
skirts extremely short and flared lampsliade-
wise carried so much ostrich that the poor
plucked bird must have rejoiced that it was
summer.
Ostrich feather was just as much in evi-
dence at the Ambassadors as at the Went-
worth on New Year’s Eve. Here gorgeous
plumes were used to help the ventilation, and
some nice shoulder-blades took the air from
smart backless frocks. A flock of newly-
engaged and married girls snatched a bite.
Mona Daley and her about-to-be A. G. God-
hard dispensed rich food to many friends,
and Audrey Pickburn, in jade greens, saw
the New Year in on her fiance’s arm. Nancy
Kerr, looking like a Christmas edition de-
luxe of a powder-puff, matched steps with
the lissom Evan Hayes. Marie Burke, corus-
cating with silver sequins, flashed in after
her show at the Royal. Percy Dawson and
bis betrothed, Rita Barnett, were ready on
the boundary to cheer 1925, and the medical
Coppleson couple stood by.
Judge Murray, of Papua, emerges from
the shower of New Year honors as Sir John,
though in the family circle he is Hubert.
Somehow the new title doesn’t sound nearly
so impressive as the old familiar one. Accord-
ing to the degree of fame a human attains,
his titles and gauds gradually drop from him
- —as though when men quote him they peeled
off the outer husk till the art, the daring
or the achievement that is the real great-
ness of the man is flashed to the world by
the mention of a bare name. How suburban,
for instance, Senator Julius Caesar sounds
in comparison with Julius Caesar! So with
Melba, Kitchener, Kipling. What a be-
littling influence even an initial would have
on their Olympic arrogance ! So the North must
—and will—still think of the man who has
built up the dependency as Judge Murray—
the tall Australian who looks more like the
fine swordsman he is (or was) than a
Lieutenant-Governor. Like his brother, Pro-
fessor Gilbert, the Judge is a great student
of literature, and his knowledge of Gaelic
is almost as intimate as his knowledge of
Australia, into the remotest corner of which
he has' travelled—often on foot. His father
had rare honor in N. S. Wales —first he
was Speaker of the Assembly, and later
President of the Council, taking the latter
chair in succession to the great William
Charles Wentworth.
Papua’s Chief has two sons. The elder,
Terence, served with a British regiment dur-
ing the Great Upheaval, and afterwards
married Philippa Kitchener, niece of the
great K. of K. The younger boy, Pat, is
making his mark at Oxford as a naturalist.
As a student at Riverview College he scoured
the bush with a mosquito-net, and knew the
names and domestic habits of every winged
creature within coo-ee.
For the first year since Rose Scott started
to hold court in her Woollahra home, 1924
saw no Christmas party there. To these
gatherings the publicans and sinners of poli-
tics in other years were eager to be invited.
There were collected also the artistic and
writing somebodies of a day that boasted
Henry Lawson and “Banjo” Paterson ; and
every guest—potential genius or plain bloke
—departed with a just-meant-for-hiinself
present. Rose Scott is a sick lady these
days, and such assemblies are too much for
her strength; but you should have seen the
Everest of mail that brought her greetings
from all the world over.
“Kodak” O'Ferrall is another sick person
who made the Postal Department work over-
time. “Kodak,” who made a continent laugh
with his “Bodger and the Boarders” and
“Municipal Dragon,” and would have ranked
with Wodehouse and Harry Leon Wilson as
a world’s laughter-maker if circumstances
had not tied him to a daily job, is sick-a-bed
at Pennant Hills. Influenza, followed by-
double pneumonia, has devastated the never
robust physique, and the little man is just
now climbing slowly back to health at Nurse
Field’s hospital, Boundary-road, Pennant
Hills.
George Marks, the man who knows
Napoleon, took a day off from his job in the
Sun office towards the end of the year to
get married. The girl who met him at the
altar was Linda Wallis, a grand-daughter
of that Knight William Cooper who in the
good old days of catch-as-catch-can owned
most of Woollahra. A souffld of ivory
georgettes and ostrich-feather fronds en-
swathed her, while a voluminous tulle veil
cascaded over all and rippled into a drawn-
out sliimmery train. Bride’s sister Vivien
’maided in roseate ninons that crescendoed to
golden millinery; Gwenyth Furley, a lace-
lined understudy to Cupid, softened the first
thud of matrimony by carpeting the aisle of
St. Mary’s with rosy petals. Bride’s mother
hostessed the congratulations at the Ambas-
sadors, aided by bridegroom’s sister
Josephine.
There will just be time for the ship’s com-
pany to clean up the vessel after Tuesday’s
party and replace any movable equipment
that the souvenir-hunter has fancied before
the Orama sails on Saturday. Apparently
half of Sydney will journey to Europe be-
tween its four decks, and will have the not
unmixed joy of sampling its untethered
dining-chairs during any rough seas that
arise. The Jimmie Burns couple will be
among the exodus, as will Nancy Munro and
her polo-playing brother. He, although he
comes from the hot North-West, won’t have
anything to learn when he reaches the icy
fastnesses of Europe’s next winter. Twice
he has wiped up all the prizes at Kosciusko
for snow sports. Mrs. Robert Williams is
another who goes to Europe. Vienna is her
goal, and here she will renew her studies
in philosophy, from which marriage and life
in tjie Northern Territory whisked her in
pre-war days.
Who remembers three little sisters named
Griffiths Avho left Australia in the long ago
to study in
Europe? Each
of the girls
was a talented
musician, and
each favored a
different in-
strument. All
three found
the fame they
sought and
two found
matrimony as,
well; with’
m a t r imony
came a return
to their native
land. Sydney
knows one of
the three as
Mrs. Walter
Swinson, of
T u r ramurra.
The lady in
the picture is
the youngest. She is still Bessie Griffiths,
and her ’cello is such an important part of
Old-World music that every now and again
one reads in the cables how the golden mes-
sage in its string, has brought surcease of
misery to post-war Europe. The artist plays
on an instrument that was given to her by
Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll.
Francis Edwards Scudamore St. Clair
Erskine, Lord Loughborough—to give that
stop-payment lordling all the names he was
called the other day in the English Bank-
ruptcy Court —was coldly refused an order
of discharge by the Registrar, who added that
the case disclosed considerable extravagance,
and he must suspend the discharge for three
years. Since 1921 the young man has spent
£18,120 of borrowed money, and of assets at
the present time there are none available. In
1916 his father cleared off a small account of
£ll,OOO for him, and in 1921 wiped a further
£9OOO off the slate. Since being demobbed
Francis Edward Scudamore has followed no
occupation, but has lived on the money-
lenders and on income receivable under a
settlement. The household expenses are paid
by hrs wife (she was Sheila Chisholm, of
Sydney), who has an income of £2OOO. That
glimpse into the peerage makes Billjim and
the fruit-farm sound “a fair treat,” after all!
This is a May Moore picture of Edna
Davidson, the clever young woman who
keeps the
North Svdnev
High School
girls’ drama-
tic club to-
gether. The
club helps the
funds of the
Grossman bur-
sary. Organis-
in g, stage-
directing and
the like are all
done by the
girls, and the
whole of the
parts in their
productions are
taken by the
slim lasses.
Edna, besides
her m a n a-
gerial work,
is quite a hit
on the acting
side.
A small boy at lvirribilli arrived home on
Christmas Eve with 15 somewhat larger fel-
lows in tow. Leaving them outside the gate
he chased in to mother. “Will Santa Claus
really come here to-night?” he breathlessly
demanded. “Of course, he will,” said mother.
“That’s all right, then,” the youngster re-
plied. “Cos I told those chaps at the gate
he would, and they’ve come to sleep here
to-night.” Mother nearly fainted, but, com-
promising, invited the menagerie to tea, and
telephoned a few orders to dad, who hadn’t
yet left his office. Just as the kids were
finishing up the tea-party, a hearty old Santa
walked into the room, patted every head,
wished them a Merry Christmas and dis-
appeared, leaving a kitbag of toys on the
floor. The small boys are still gasping.
Florence Violet Wallace, the lady who
deals in radio, became Mrs. Cecil Macken-
zie, of Watson’s Bay, according to schedule,
during the week. She did the deed so
quietly that not even a whisper of the cere-
mony was caught by the keenest listener-in.
Ellis Silas, the man who paints the Tro-
briands, has been elected a Fellow of the
Royal Geographical Society because of his
lectures on Papua. He gave a series at the
London University, where he held the atten-
tion of an audience of brilliant ethnologists.
Art in London, he says, might be a corpse as
far as sales are concerned—there is one R.A.
who has not sold a picture for five years.
Pretty Sylvia Bremer, Manly’s outstand-
ing contribution to the beauties of the silver-
sheet, was married the other day at the
Glenwood Inn, Riverside, California. Her
husband is Dr. Harry Martin, who before
serving in the war practised in Chicago. Now
he retails health in Los Angeles. Sylvia,
who has been under contract with First
National, and starred in “The Woman
on the Jury,” “The Girl of the Golden West”
and “Babu,” says she’s gone out of pictures
for good. Her mother. Mrs. Plunkett, now
lives in Los Angeles.
The girl in the flat opposite came back
from Christmas with her fiance’s people
minus her engagement-ring. Under stern
questioning she admitted that the young man
was everything she had thought him, and if
possible his socks showed an improvement
in artistic perception ; but she was terrified
to acquire a mother-in-law who was dressed
in lace neckbands boned to the lobe of the
ear by eight o’clock every morning, and
whose millinery was so Gothic it could only
be described as bigoted.
News has reached Sydney of Eugenie
Moreau’s marriage in London to Arthur
Charles Daubney, the eldest son of General
James Daubney. Eugenie was one of the
three attractive-looking daughters of Henry
Moreau, perfume indentor, who keeps the
Roger Gallet banner afloat. Eugenie in her
own right has brains allied to a keen clothes
sense, and was with Ranicar’s as designer
when Mrs. Philip Morton’s slim elegance
gave the business its introduction to Sydney.
The Rupert Clarkes are dug in at present
at 16 Hill-street, Berkeley-square. They
were staying at the Ritz, but got into their
own home in time for Rupert’s arrival on
the Mooltan with his daughter, Mrs. Reggie
Power, and lii s lady’s sister, Mrs. John
Mellor.
Hundreds hung about St. James’s on Mon-
day evening to watch the arrival and de-
parture of the guests bidden to Mona Daley's
wedding to A. C. Godhard. That’s all the
poor onlookers could see, for a police patrol
and entr<se cards for the invited kept the
most intrepid rubberneck outside the church
gates. The church itself looked positively
frivolous in its decking of pink-and-blue blos-
soms. Mona was sheathed in ivory satin
stiff with silver embroideries ; the long train,
handled by little Jean Fitzpatrick, was of
the same material, with silver embossings.
Mary Sheehan, finance secretary of St. Mar-
garet’s, and Pamela Stevens ’maided, in old-
world hooped frocks of mauve and silver
and jade and silver respectively. Essie Ack-
land sang, and the bride’s mother was hand-
some, in black satin and lace. The Went-
worth housed the party; and the Orama on
Saturday carries Mona and her husband to
Europe for eight months.
It was Colonel Stan, (not General Gran.)
Ryrie who “rfetired from the R.A.A. in a
gale of post-war retrenchment,” and who
entertained the clan on his Monaro sheep-
run at Christmas. Stan, and Gran, are
cousins. The latter, who is M.H.R. for
Warringah, motored his wife to Monaro for
the gathering, and the lady brought greet-
ings from the pretty twin-daughters, whom
she left with friends in London for a time.
The Crown has been pleased to dub Truby
King a Knight Bachelor, but thousands of
sturdy Maoriland and Australian youngsters
have good reason to call him their father and
mother. A Spartan parent is the veteran
M.L. director of Child Welfare when vicious i
or slovenly superstitions like “comforters”
or unhygienic bottles endanger the health
of his numerous brood; but an easy and
kindly one as well, who recognises the child’s
healthy need and craving for light, move-
ment and freedom. The Plunket Society,
whose quiet, efficient nurses bring the light
of commonsense into the darkness of homes,
not only in his own country, but in Aus-
tralia, too, is another child of his energy
and talent. The kindly Truby King phiz is
almost as well known in Sydney as it is in
Wellington.
As far ba;k as 1916 a group of city busi-
ness girls formed the association called the
Clerical Women War-workers. These girls
after or before their own day’s toil gave
splendid service to the different comforts
societies in the matter of typing circulars
and envelopes, and in pushing on the various
“Days.” The capable chits also started a
threepence-a-week collection, from which
oyer £2OOO was garnered in three years.
Since the Armistice the C.W.W.W. has been*
helping disabled or out-of-work soldiers and
their dependants. Last year it gave a gal-
lant helping hand to 21 soldier families, and
supplied tools of trade to several men, every
one of whom, by the way, has made good.
In addition, Hut 13, at Randwick, has been
visited every alternate Saturday. Now £5O
is needed to keep the good work going. Miss
Ross Huxley will welcome the smallest con-
tribution at 92b Pitt-street.
Brisbane sees the Old Year out:—
Against the John Hops’ ultimatum, skyrockets
assailed high Heaven, and crackers and hungers
exploded in the city squares. Amongst the parties
was the Ross Munros’ ball at Ross Roy, where
Mrs. Jack Chandler helped her mother to receive
a crowd in a setting of bon-bons, balloons, asters
and roses. Lennons’ management fixed up a dinner
dance, amid artificial hoar-frost and genuine gerberas.
The George Darvalls, Garth Elwyn, Vera Cotton,
Norah Halford and the Wardrops were among
those who danced. Mrs. Bunett welcomed 1925 to
Selby with a party; and the Pipers did their best
to frighten it away from the Trocadero.
Pink and blue was the color scheme in St.
Stephen’s Kirk when Beryl Wonderley said she
would to James Kemp. Rev. Armour tied the
knot, and Brigadier-General Robertson gave his niece
away. She wore a French frock of ivory mariette,
with an ivory and cloth-of-silver train and a Brussels
lace veil.
Ascot races drew a crowd, amongst them Mrs.
Tully, in cream silk; Mrs. Franlclyn-Vale Mort, in
pink crepe; Mrs. Jack Chandler, in white with
black and red embroideries ; Mrs. Robert Thompson,
in blue and red; and Mrs. Spencer Brown, in white.
The Salvation Army Eventide Home at Red Hill
was decorated with holly and gay streamers, and
the board was lavishly spread for the 140 old chaps
who are spending their twilight there. This year the
feast lacked cheery old Mullally, who “knew Adam
Lindsay Gordon.” He died in November, at 106.
Kurrowah station has lately changed hands. It
was once the home of Frank Brodribb, of Broken
Hill fame.
One of the original members of the Gympie Stoex
Exchange, Frederick C. Walker, has celebrated his
golden wedding at Horseshoe Bend. He saw the dawn
in Adelaide in ’52, his wife being born in England
the same year. The hearty pair have 41 living-
descendants.
, Mabel and Meta Hooper gave a dance at their
Toowoomba home amid a profusion of pink and
blue hydrangeas. Bats and owls lent a witchery
to the decorations, and there was a big roll up of
guests.
Brisbane Museum is housing the last coach run
by Cobb and Co. A private person proffered £l5O
for the interesting relic, but the Federal Government’s
offer of £lOO was accepted. It will go to Canberra
when there is accommodation for it.
The Brisbane Highland Society played the pipes
from Hawthorne tram terminus to Archie Campbell’s
home. John Mackenzie handed a cut crystal vase
to the hostess and a fountain-pen to the host.
Dancing and music finished a hilarious nicht.
Among those who braved a threatening sky for
the races on New Year’s Day were Mrs. Victor
Bell, in white and pink; Mrs. A. R. Godsall, in
blue; Mrs. Glyn Connolly, in hyacinth; Mrs. Willie
Persse, in mauve; and Jean Grant, in white with a

More cricket records went by the board m
the first three clays of the Test match at Melbourne.
On Now Year’s Day the crowd started to accumulate
at breakfast time, and by the luncheon adjournment
the M.C.G. held 49,413 people, hundreds of whom
had to be content with sitting behind the sight-
boards. The second day’s attendance reached 47,900,
and Saturday's crowd numbered 48,500, the offertory
for three days realising £14,817. There has been
nothing like it in the history of the game. Collins
won the toss, as usual, but the wicket played a
bit trickily for a time —it often does before lunch—
and the captain, Bardsley and A. Richardson
were dismissed cheaply. It was 3 for 47 when Taylor
joined Ponsford, but the pair got the measure of
the bowling and completely altered the situation, the
board showing 208 when Taylor was run out. He
had made 72 in his finest style, and was going
strongly for another century when Ponsford called
him for a difficult run; Hobbs did the rest. Vic
Richardson carried on the good work and saw Pons-
ford reach 128 before Tate bowled the Victorian
with his first delivery on the second day. Ponsford’s
was a sound and immensely valuable innings, marred
by a chance at 63. Richardson went on to 138,
playing the most brilliant knock on the side. He
should have been out at 07, when he hit one of
Tyldesley’s curly ones straight into Douglas's hands
at forward leg; and he repaid Douglas by slogging
him for 21 in a single over. But, getting too
reckless, he attempted an impossible run and Chap-
man cleverly threw his wicket down. lvelleway
(32), Gregory (44) and Oldfield (39 n. 0.) did
their share, and more; and Hartkopf, playing his
first Test match (Hendry had been omitted, foolishly
many thought) contributed a vigorous 80. The
innings closed for 600, made in two days less 10
minutes. After the first hour or so the bowling
rarely looked dangerous, but Gilligan got 3 for 114
and Tate 3 for 142.
It was here mentioned last w r eek that Hobbs and
Sutcliffe had made 268 for the first wicket against
the S’Africans, and “unless Australia strengthens the
bowling department,” it was added, “they are
not unlikely to repeat the achievement at our expense. ’
In point of fact, the pair put 283 to their credit on
Saturday, grimly staying at the wickets all day.
They took no risks even when they were well set,
and gave no real chance during the five hours. It
was not brilliant cricket, although with the huge;
task before the Englishmen the stolidity was justi-
fied. The situation was expressed by a barracker,
who elevated a spade above the heads of the crowd,
and yelled: “Is this any use to you, Collins?” 1
length bowler would have been a treasure between
4.30 p.m. and the drawing of stumps, when the
batsmen were tired and the “bosies” were useless, but
the selectors had dropped Hendry and hadn’t picked
Ryder, so the side paid the penalty. As often
happens in these cases, the magnificent partnership
soon ended on the fourth day, one of Hailey’s full
tosses bowling Hobbs- —“the first that ever got. past
me,” said the crestfallen Surrey crack —without a
run being added. Hobbs had added 154 to his long
list of memorable knocks in first-class matches. Then
Gregory bowled WoolJey with a trimmer, and
Hailey‘sold Hearne with a wrong ’un; and instead
of nil for 283 it was 3 for 305. Hearne, like Sand-
ham, makes the mistake of playing back to Hailey ;
a batsman who does that is a gift to him. Hendren
(32) stayed with Sutcliffe while 68 runs were
added, and the Yorkshireman was the next to go,
clean bowled by Kelleway. He had made 176 without
giving a chance, and the crowd cheered him all
the way from the wicket to his dressing-room. Chap-
man (28) and Tate (34) were the only others who
gave any trouble, and the last wicket fell at 4< 9 -
a fine score in ordinary circumstances, but disap-
pointing to Gilligan after the great start. Arthur
Richardson (2 for 20) got the bowling average;
he has a nice free action and is decidedly useful
when not overworked, as he is in inter-State matches.
Gregory took three for 124; Mailey 2 for 141;
Kelleway 2 for 62, and Hartkopf 1 for 121.
* * * *
With a lead of 121 and third use of a wicket
on which 1079 runs had been made, Australia
looked to have the match in hand. Rut a change came
over the scene when Tate got Rardsley l.b.w. with
his third ball, and sent Arthur Richardson to
join the left-hander a couple of overs later. Then
Ponsford mistimed a fast one and it was 3 for 27
Tate 3 for 5. Collins, however, was still there,
and with Tavlor to help him the captain carried
the score to 63 before stumps were drawn. On Tues-
day the pair stayed together till 106 was on the
board, when Collins was bowled by Hearne for a
useful 30—he had previously given an easy chance
to Tate off the latter’s own bowling. Vic Richardson
was snapped up, by Strudwick, off Hearne, before lie
had reached double figures, but Taylor stayed till
he had made 90. As in the second innings at Sydney
the A.I.F. man’s hand was of the utmost value to
his side; he is certainly having a great season. Ihe
odds still favored Australia when this page had to
close down the nucstion being whether England could
make upwards of 350 runs on a pitch that showed
signs of crumbling.
“H. Hardupp”: On the first day of the
match, a fair partisan of Douglas made herself
conspicuous in the members’ stand. She was con-
vinced that he was the greatest cricketer in the
field “It stands to reason, mai deah,” she explained
to a friend, “that a man they bring all the way
out from England to play cricket must be better than
the men they merely pick heali.” Ponsford had
just belted the Englishman for a few when the lady
applauded wildly. “Look 1” she exclaimed Douglas
has reached his 50. It’s a shame they don t give
him a cheeah!” He had, too —no wickets for 50.
But Douglas didn’t get it all; Hobbs was a hero
to another skirted enthusiast. “Yes I intend
to applaud anything he does!” she confided, ) le! j
the best cricketer in the English team. He insisted
upon bringing his wife with him!”
A “ROUND ” OF GOLF.
“How do we stand?"
“We’re both square!"
“Centurion”: In Melbourne last week the
Board of Control decided the vexed question of what
are first-class matches in Australia. They . are:
Tests, matches between English and State Xl’s, inter-
state and M.L. games, affairs such as the Howell
and Iredale benefits, and Australia v. The Rest. Pons-
ford’s 429 against Tasmania has been adjudged a
first-class record, so poor old Archie Madaren’s
bitter protest against the disturbance of his own long-
standing 418, for Lancashire against Somerset, is
stoushed. Test-match men playing out of their
own State are to ,receive a bite of 30s. a day, in
addition to the £3O bonus, a rise of 10s. a day.
It was also resolved that any player refusing to
represent his State “without reasonable excuse” will
not be considered for representative matches—un-
pleasant news for cricketers addicted to gardening.
* * * *
“Tren”: Though the match between the
second elevens of N. S. Wales and Victoria ended in
a draw, it is probable that had the Vies, brought
over a few more of the Hawthorn-East Melbourne boys
they would have won easily. As it was, the three
combine representatives almost pulled the game off
for their State. Keith Millar top-scored in the
first innings with 89 n. 0., and made a useful 29 in
the second; and, though all the bowlers were tried,
he and his two pennant mates, Rayson and Gamble,
skittled every N. S. Wales wicket between them.
This was indeed a splendid performance, and as a
reward the State selectors should let Rayson develop his
googlies, Gamble his fast-medium swervers, and Millar
his all-round skill at practice with the Sheffield team.
All three youngsters have natural ability and keen-
ness, and only require the craft that old stagers, can
impart to make them topnotchers.
“11. Hardupp”: The ill wind that blew
enthusiasts away from the Melbourne C. G. on the
Saturday when play in the inter-State match was
found impossible whirled a lot of silver amongst
youngsters engaged in a match outside. A large
section of the disappointed crowd became interested
in the kids’ game, some of the items provided being
20 in two big hits by one youngster—there were no
boundaries—and three wickets in one over, bagged
by a diminutive bowler. Selector Pete McAlister
passed round the hat, and, the two star performers
having been suitably recognised, the rest of a fair
collection was whacked among the other players.
Most of it was blewed on ice-creftm, but the pitchers
came in for their share.
“Past Grammar": A three days’ match
on the Sydney Cricket Ground between a N.S.W.
“Second XI” (“fourth” would have fitted better)
and a side from Queensland, minus Hornibrook,
ended in a draw. The game should go down to
cricket history, if it is not mercifully obliterated
from the records, as the most execrable exhibition
of ground and lofty fielding ever seen on the big
ground. Dropped catches were past all counting.
O’Connor, the Queensland captain-keeper, finished
up his “big” season well with 141 and 47. tor
Queensland against the Englishmen he made 29 and
65 and for an Australian XI, 29 and 65 n.o. Austin
Punch, with 87 and 94, was the hero of the N.S.W.
side, and the lefthand G.P.S. boy Salmon ran him a
close second with 68 and 94. None of the bowling
averages were remarkable. Queensland got 406
and 211 for 8 (declared) against 290 and 4 for 255
by N.S.W.
* * * *
“Hamer”: The umpires had come out and
the players were following, when one of the white-
coats, having difficulty in placing the bails, went
down on his knees to adjust them. Then the voice
of a barracker was heard: “I knoo the game was
gettin’ solemn, but I never thought they d open it
with prayer!”
“Adelaide”: South Ans. is fooling dis-
couraged about its young cricketers. They do well
enough in club games, but flop when the higher trials
come on. Against the colts of Victoria, they could
put up only 283 in two innings, and the visitors
nearly equalled that in one, winning by 10 wickets.
In the inter-State matches, most of the work has
been done by the veteran members of the side. Local
batting form is complicated at the moment by heroes
of the past. Randell and Willsmore, corning back
with high scores. Also in club bowling, Williams has
taken most wickets this season, with old-timers in
Pincombe and Loveridge next.
“11. Ilardupp”: The turf peerage lost a
distinguished character when “The Count” closed
his books at 76. Purves, K.C., is said to have
bestowed the title on E. N. Abrahams ; and it stuck.
It is 50 years since
The Count, went into
the game for keeps,
but at least a couple
of years before, when
he was an assistant in
Barnard’s tobacco store
in Bourke-street, he
compiled a libretto as
a sideline. The vete-
ran never liked cash
betting. All his trans-
actions were entered
in a notebook, and
even when the law
made the issue of
tickets compulsory, he
tore up the pasteboards
and adhered to the old
method of recording
transactions with bis
clients. A native of
Kent, Abrahams had
seen every Melbourne
Cup since Warrior won
in 1869. Like his
friend Phil Glenister,
who predeceased him,
he used to grin broadly
when he read in some
sensational sheet that
“.Jim Bagthumper laid
£ 80,000 against the
favorite,” and that
“Splificate’s victory
took £500,000 out of
the Ring.” According
to the old ’un, the
biggest individual book
in his half-century of
fielding was one of
£40,000, the layer be-
ing the late Humphrey
Oxenham, and the race
the 1892 Melbourne Cup. Olenloth, a rank outsider
won, and Oxey cleared £32,000.
“Bad Australian”: The Count was a very hospitable
man, and at one time kept open house for his
friends. He was a philosopher likewise, but I
remember two occasions when he lost his temper. One
was when Bob Sievier started cash-betting at Fleming-
ton with very little in the bag. Another was when a
client “took the knock.” “See, mister,” said
Abrahams to the offender, “once a gentleman always
a gentleman. But you can go to blanky Hades,”
he added, turning on his heel.

Sydney Tattersall’s Club had a fine crowd
for the second day of its annual meeting, and over
the walnuts and the wine even its most dismal
Jeremiah admitted that he had just, managed to
pay expenses. The winners were Jubilant (10’s)
in the Novice Handicap; Quixotic (12’s) in the
Flying ; Wedding Eve (14’s) in the Nursery; Royal
Dighton (10’s) in Tatt.’s Club Cup; imported
Cistercian (6’s) in the Alfred Hill Handicap ; and
Fair Rosaleen (7’s) in the New Year’s Gift. The
only favorite who didn’t run shockingly was Friars-
dale, in Fair Rosalern’s race, and those who went
for a recovery on the English chestnut., now owned
by Otway Falkiner, were unlucky not to collect—-
Brown made too much use of him altogether. Friars-
dale is built like a Doncaster horse, and he may be
worth bearing in mind for the Easter handicap, for
his form will very probably improve. And there
are more unlikely things than that Confusion will
furnish into a Sydney Cup horse. In Tatt.’s Cup,
as in the larger race on Boxing Day, the gelded
son of Powhatan —lodal proved too much of a
handful over the last furlong for his little jockey
and was beaten a head by honest Royal Dighton, who,
tried as a stayer for the first time, finished true
as steel, the 12 furlongs being run in 2min. 33Isec.
Royal Roue, galloping fast on the rails, earned
third money for J. C. Forsayth, who will yet
recover his losses on this hardy-looking customer.
First, second and third are four-year-olds, and all
three are good.
* * * *
Sol Green supplied the winner of the
V.R.C. Standish Handicap in Yaldes, a three-
year-old bay gelding by Valais—Court Martial
Second favorite at 7’s, Valdes got away
well and was always at or near the front;
at the half-distance he settled Last Drop and eann
on to win by a neck, with the fast-finishing Royal
Thought (favorite at 9 to 2) third. The time was
lmin. 12jsec.—very fast for six furlongs on th(
Caulfield course—atid Valdes shaped as if a few
more furlongs wouldn’t trouble him. All Sunshine
(s’s), outstaying King Pan and imported Sailing
Home, landed the Bagot Handicap for H. Mastertor
in 2min. 32isec. for the 12 furlongs. The son oi
All Black—Cranbrook carried Bst. 101b.—171b. more
than his weight in the last Doncaster Handicap.
Had he left the barrier smartly on that occasion there
would have been no Whittier.
* * * *
After his w.f.a. win on the opening day
of the Perth Cup meeting, Easingwold went sore
and had to be withdrawn from the W.A.T.C. Railway
Stakes, for which he had been a warm favorite in
the ante-post betting. In his absence, Borgia (7 to 2)
made a big fiehl look rather cheap. Borgia is a
live-year-olel brown gelding by Jolly Beggar out ol
Lorraine, a mare that has thrown several good winners
in the West; he is owned by a bookmaker and was
ridden by the crack Westralian lightweight, Morley.
The same boy guided Mercato (3’s) to victory in the
Perth Cup for the owner-trainer Tom Tighe, to
whom he used to be apprenticed. It generally takes
a good horse to win the Perth Cup, but Mercato is
unlikely to rival the deeds of Eurythmic or Lilypond,
although a nag that can leave two miles behind
in 3min. 27 l-ssec, is of no mean quality. He
is an imported five-year-old by Bay D’Or —Slave
Trade. Second to Mercato was the topweight,
Eracre, and the other place was filled by Char,
who was second in Lilyveil’s Cup.
* * * *
The All Blacks wound up their tour of
Britain by drubbing England at Twickenham: 4
tries, a converted goal and a penalty goal (17
points) to 2 tries, a converted goal and a penalty
goal (11 points). England had to play J. (V
Gibbs, the Harlequin winger, instead of Raymond,
the Australian; on the other hand, Cyril Brownlie,
the splendid M.L. forward, was sent off by the
Welsh referee eight minutes after the start. Despite
this handicap, the Maorilanders were always too
solid for the Englishmen ; they were 9 —3 at half-
time and were never in danger afterwards. The
crowd numbered 7)0,000 and included the Prince
of Wales and brother Henry, while George Rex hail
a special telegraph service to report progress to
him at home. The Maorilanders tackle France next.
In their 28 games in England and Wales they
scored 654 points to 98 without losing a
game —a great record, truly. The only defeat sus-
tained by the side was that in the first match against
N.S.W. last season, whin the tourists were only
a couple of days off the boat.
* * * *
“Toosday” (U.S.A.) : Remarkable how
the Puritan tradition dominates some forms of U.S.
sport. Garbisch, captain of West Point football team,
victorious over Annapolis Naval Academy before an
audience of 80,000, including President Coolidge,
revealed to 1200 silent classmates that “the team
prayed earnestly before every game.” Mulligan, the
Army forward, after being knocked cold by a Yale
player in the 1923 Army-Yale game, told a mute
audience that “Gahd deserted me when I needed Him
most.” Centre College, of Kentucky, who in 1922
gave the Harvard team the toughest of battles,
prayed on the field before the game. Harvard seems
to have come to the conclusion that the Kentuckian’s
prayers were “over the odds” ; at all events, it
dropped Centre from the 1923 schedule. Yale like-
wise severed relations with Boston College, another
team that had religion. The Bostonians’ weight
of prayers had broken a forward’s leg, given another
concussion of the brain, brought on four fist fights,
and disabled Aldrich, the Tommy Lawton of Yale.
* * * *
Another ill-fated pug —the fourth in 15
months —has received his death-blow in a Stadium
ring. Reg Anderson, a youngster of 20, was the
latest victim; knocked out; in a fight at the Sydney
Stadium on December 30, he was carried away to
die, like poor little Mendies and the others. The
usual mob of Labor politicians was prominent at
the funeral, and will doubtless be equally conspicuous
at the benefit. But there was no response from
these gentry when it was suggested that Stadium
pugilists (all drawn from the working class) should
be compulsorily insured against the risks incident to
the calling, and complaints that preliminary boxers
were miserably paid likewise left them cold. Of
course, Wren the ex-tote and pony-racing man has
had portion of his riches invested in Stadiums, Ltd.
And Wren is One of Us.
“Spike”: A great cycling family are the
Horders. George, the father, was making money at the
game before some of the present-day riders were out
of rompers; and his 10 miles unpaced record, made
at Sydney in 1914 (21min. 50sec.), still stands. And
the veteran is not done with yet. Horace and Harris,
his sons, are rivalling the achievements of Dad when
Dad was at his best. A few years ago they were the
topnotchers on the Sydney “saucer”; but after
Harris Herder’s great form in America last year, the
Melbourne promoters signed them up. Harold
Horder, of Rugby League celebrity, is a cousin.
Interest in the tennis tournament at South
Yarra centred in the clash between J. B. Hawkes
and Mclnnes, who had never before met in a singles
final. But the schoolboy champion, P. Haege, provided
some fireworks ; his methods were too enterprising, for
the inter-State player N. Rainey, and he made a credit-
able fight with Mclnnes. With the development of
tactical ability and restraint Haege will be a great
plaver. The final was remarkable mainly for the
mistakes made by both Davis Cuppers, although there
were patches of brilliant tennis. Hawkes won the
first set, 6 —l, but Mclnnes did best, in the early
stages of the next. However, he became erratic,
and it was mainly on his faults that Hawkes won the
set, 6 —4 and the match.
* * * *
The Christmas tennis in Adelaide con-
firmed the impression that there is nothing much
to chose between Dr. Hone and Rowe. Their five
sets were all 6 —4, and Rowe won two of the first
three, but Hone lasted a trifle the longer. On the
other hand, in the doubles, Rowe, with Dr. Gurner,
lost the first two sets to Hone and G. K. Thomas (the
veteran left-hander, no relation to R. V. Thomas),
but won the next three. R. V. Thomas, by the way,
is in better health, and talks of playing again next
season.
THE MARTYR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A slight fire broke out in the flooring of the
grandstand shortly befoi v the Test match was
resumed on Saturday. Some difficulty was experienced
by the firemen in extinguishing it owing to the
reluctance of those near the burning boards to risic
losing their seats.”
The fumes of smouldering wood are in my smeller,
There’s something feels like flame around my feet.
Being score lied like this is tough upon a feller,
Still ’twould be tougher still to lose my seat.
The philosophic words of Samuel Weller
When he was getting soaked let me repeat.
I came to see the match and see it through,
Tell me “wot good my mindin’ it would do?”
Quick tongues of fire between my boots are poking,
My neighbors right and left are being coerced—
The clouds of smoke are obviously choking
Enough to make them think of “Safety First.”
And yet, though my predicament’s provoking,
The stand is packed already fit to burst,
And, should I budge, it must be at the cost
Of seeing those other “ashes” held—or lost.
Here, from this coign, exultantly and gaily
I came to watch the Gilligan brigade
Succumbing to the tortuous wiles of Mailev,
Having their stumps by Gregory’s whizzers laid,
To miss no point recorded in the daily
Papers of feats where crouch the slips arrayed
Fan-wise. And shall I leave my chosen post
Because my trilbies are beginning to toast?
Never! Here come the firemen with their hoses
My previous discomfort to complete.
My pants, 1 fear, are ruined. Holy Moses!
My cherished socks are clearly gone a treat,
First singed, then drenched. But this at least dis-

Roland Wilson, the Tasmanian Rhodes
scholar for 1925, is the first State High-
sehool boy to be selected in the Speck. He
hails from Devonport, is only 20, and so far
has given a particularly good account o~
himself in commercial subjects.
In his fury at being resisted, in a timid
and irregular way, by the W estralian Haber
Government, Walsh (imp.) informed the
Perth Worker that “patriotic Labor politi-
cians with their ‘anti-Germanism, anti-
Americanism’ or ‘ White* Australianism are
enemies of the working-class.” That is what
happens to a man when Moscowism rushes
to his head.
Amid the tragedy of the latest birth statis-
tics the Federal capital territory furnishes
a gleam of mirth. The Commonwealth’s
birth-rate for 1923 was 2377 and the death-
rate 989 per 100,000 inhabitants. The
figures for the Canberra territory were 5(3
and 302 per 100,000 ljespectively. The ex-
planation seems to be that the alleged popu-
lation of the place doesn’t live there at all.
It comes in the morning, like the washlady;
and, like the wash-female, departs at night,
and there is no permanence about it.
Whether deserved or not, Earle Page has
the reputation of living on toast and tea, as
that takes less time than a proper meal.
Even on his short visits to his home it is
no unusual thing for him to perform several
surgical operations. His pet child, the New'
States movement, and the electric-power
scheme in Grafton, amongst other things,
have taken a lot of his time and attention,
but the trouble caused by some of the mem-
bers of his own party being so bitterly op-
posed to the pact with the Nationalists has
proved the last straw of his load. He has
gone on two months’ leave to Canada, and
the term will be extended if the state of his
health demands it.
One of the shortest-lived treaties on record
was begun and finished lately at Newcastle.
It being the Christmas season, when all the
devils of discord, including Tom Bolsli, were
unchained, the wharfies, looking round for
something to be disagreeable about, decided
that plaster of Paris is noxious cargo, and
deman led Is. fid. per hour extra. The arbi-
tration of the local Reference Board, created
especially for such emergencies, was scorned,
and the strike commenced. Later the union
secretary persuaded the strikers to promise
that they would abide by the Board’s de-
cision, and the Board met at once and in the
usual way granted a rise of Is. per hour. The
swiftness of the settlement so upset the
strikers that when the owners looked around
for men to carry on under the new award
they found there weren't any—they had all
disappeared.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Those doleful ditties
which have been discussed by Pov. Pointers
were made all the more lugubrious, in some
cases, by exponents who happened to be
public characters. There was a woman who
used to stand in Railway-square, Sydney,
near where Clay’s Theatre now is. Over
and over again she screeched dismally:—
On-lee a leeaf! Ah, but what grie-eaf
It gyve in the de-ar long er-go.
Once it was red; now fyded an’ dead,
An’ tlie woman ’oo wore it lies low!
And there are singers who can turn words
intended to be inspiringly cheerful into dread-
ful gloom. I recall the drone of voices from
a small Bethel in Napier (M.L.) as the
congregants sang in time several times too
slow: —
O-o-o-h, let tus be jo-o-ooyful,
Jo-o-oyful, jo-o-oyful, jo-o-ooi/ful!
O-o-oh, let tus be jo-o-ooyful,
Till we meet ter part no mo-o-ore!
I remember reading next day that there
had been three suicides in Napier that week.
“T.O.L”: In years gone by there was a
theatre known as Russell’s, in Queen-street,
now Dalley-street, Sydney. Russell (an elec-
troplater by trade), Maggie Oliver, Julia
Mathews, Kate Corcoran and others who
lived to become more or less famous played
there. Kate Corcoran’s father had a queer
end: he fell asleep in the gallery of the
Theatre Royal, and, waking up after the show
was over, fell into the pit and. was killed. His
daughter married Jack Smith, M.L.A. for
Wellington, and well known on the turf as
the pal of William A. Long. About the same
time the late W. 11. Ford had a theatre in
Sussex-street, where he trained pupils for the
stage. Ford’s mother and grandmother were
noted, in their time at Astley’s, London, cele-
brated by Dickens. W.H. came to Sydney
in 1847, and applied for an engagement at
the Victoria Theatre, but, advised by the
caretaker to seek other employment, as the
playhouse only opened three nights, a week,
and business was dull, he took a job on a
Queensland station. Later on he opened the
first theatre in Brisbane, and for 10 years
he was costumier at the Opera House, Mel-
bourne. He died about 10 years ago in Mel-
bourne, at the age of 88.
“Ctesar’s Ghost”: An experience of running
Sunday entertainments in a Maoriland capi-
tal makes me sympathise with those St.
Kilda (Vic.) dance-pavilion proprietors upon
whom restrictions have been placed by the
disapproving civic elders. There have been
Sunday band concerts at these places, the
audience paying in advance for the refresh-
ment it got at the tables. Now Bumbledom
says that the charge for ice-cream and cool-
drinks must not be collected until the goods
are delivered. My “sacred” concerts (which
included more or less humorous recitations
and secular ballads), began with permission
to take up an offertory, but the indignation
of people who objected to part with three-
pence (it was rarely more than that) found
copious expression in the papers, alongside
the yelps of wowsers who wanted the con-
certs suppressed; and the conditions were
gradually tightened. At length it was stipu-
lated that the collection hud to be made
after the performance. Maybe the absurd
woman who sang “The Gipsy’s Warning,”
and laid undue stress on that idiotic line
“Keep thy gold—l do not wish it,” had some-
thing to do with the dreadful result of that
night’s collection; but the last straw came
when a man issuing forth with his alleged
family of a dozen or so tendered a shilling
and asked for ninepenee change. That
settled the sacred concerts, and me.

profits £35,006. In the first year of its existence the Bank paid a dividend, and has
continued without intermission for 83 years to pay regular dividends to its shareholders,
the last dividend being at the rate of 174 per cent, per annum.

WHY NEW CAPITAL IS REQUIRED.
The Directors of the Bank have been much impressed with the great and substantial
developments of Western Australia, which they are confident will continue. This opinion
is based not only on the general progress of the State, but on the increased volume of
new business offering, and the growing demands for accommodation by the Bank’s
customers.
In order that this new business shall be handled effectively, more capital is required,
and the Directors have accordingly obtained authorisation from the Shareholders for
the issue of 500,000 £1 Shares to be issued at such time, in such issue, at such premium
as the Board of Directors may from time to time provide.
Acting on this authorisation the Directors have decided to issue 150,000 £1 Shares,
and have obtained a contract to purchase 100,000 Shares in London upon terms which
will be completed on or before July 2, 1925, and to call for applications in Australia
for 50,000 £1 Shares at a premium of £1 10s. per share, with the right to the Board
to issue an additional 50,000 £1 Shares and to allot the same if the Board considers
advisable. 1
DIVIDENDS.
Whilst in no way making any promise or guarantee in connection with future
dividends, the Directors are of opinion there will not be any difficulty in distributing
profits to the extent of 16§ per cent, on the existing capital of £500,000, together with
the new capital now being sought.
Dividends will be payable half-yearly in May and November in any Australian
capital, Auckland. Wellington. Christchurch, Dunedin, or London, free of exchange.
All new Shares will rank for dividend and in all other respects ppri passu with
the existing ordinary Shares of the Bank, except that the Shares will not receive
dividends for the half-year ending March 30, 1925. They will, however, receive full
dividend for the half-year ending September 28, 1925.
APPLICATIONS FOR SHARES.
Applications for the 50,000 Shares, accompanied by cheque drawn to the order
of Supervising Brokers, may be made to any member of the Stock Exchanges of Adelaide,
Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane or Hobart; or to any member of the Stock Exchange,
Perth, accompanied by cheque drawn to the order of The Western Australian Bank; or
to the Bank's Head Office, Perth, or any branch, free of exchange.
SUPERVISING BROKERS.
The following have been appointed Supervising Brokers: Adelaide—S. C. Ward
nd Co.; Melbourne—Ward and Co.; Sydney—S. C. Ward and Co. and Tilley and Co.;
risbane—Henry Monteith and Co.; and brokers will pass all applications and payments
trough those firms in the respective capitals. . , , .. ,
The 50,000 Shares will be allotted m order of application as received at the Head
ffice, Perth, and notice will be given by advertisement of the closing of the list.
Where no allotment is made the application money will be returned in full, and
here the number of shares allotted is less than the number applied for, the balance of
ie application money will be applied on account of the allotment money. Failure to
ay the allotment money or any instalment when due will render previous payments
able to forfeiture. _ , , , ~ „ -c-.
A copy of the Deed of Settlement of the Corporation can be inspected at the Head
iffice, Perth, during banking hours. ... u
Owing to numerous requests received from shareholders resident outside Wester
.ustralia, authority was given to the Directors at the Half-Yearly Meeting of b -
olders held on November 5, 1924, to proceed with necessary arrangements for the
-tablishment of Branch Share Registers in the United Kingdom or any State of the
ommonwealth-, or any part of the British Dominions. Action has been tak i to
n amendment of the Bank's Act of Parliament with this object in view.

“In my opinion the New Standard Basses are superior to anything I have

or howled at as a tyrant.

“So This Is London” pursues at Sydney
Palace its self-imposed task of making the
two great branches of the English-speaking
race better acquainted with one another. If
Charles Dickens had written “Martin
Chuzzlewit” and “American Notes” in the
same admirable spirit, the Jefferson Bricks
of the period would have had less cause for
complaint.
** * *
The only damping reflection provoked by
“The Green Goddess,” at Sydney Cri., is
that William Archer will never taken an
author’s call again.
** * *
“The Rise of Rosie O’Reilly” continues
to provoke as many long-drawn-out “Oh’s!”
and “Ah’s!” at Sydney Opera House as the
sky\vard ascent of some super-rocket in a
particularly gorgeous display of pyrotech-
nics.

It was a happy idea of Fuller’s to cut
“The Bunyip” out of blackfellow mythology
and break the ungainly beast into pantomime
at Sydney Hippodrome. The bogey that gins
employ to quieten their piccaninnies has been
transformed into the most mirthful of fauna.
“GOOD MORNING, DEARIE.” AT HIS
MAJESTY’S, MELBOURNE.
The Rose-Marie of Josie Melville, and Dan

“Betty” is in her seventh week of har-
monious hilarity at Sydney Her Majesty’s.
The current Sydney Tivoli programme is
good in spots, the best spot being the Novelle
brothers, who fiddle and chirrup themselves
into the graces of the groundlings, notably
with “Humming Birds’ Duet.” The physical
proportions of the Hadji Kaber Arabs are
viewed approvingly by pro-Slieik flapperdom
when they keep still enough to have their
muscles admired, and the Four Ortons prove
graceful exponents of the art of balancing.
Pierce and Watson wring unmelodious noises
from a steel saw and a penny balloon ; Ross
Barker and McLennan are as noisy, but more
harmonious.
►Sydney Fullers’ Lilliputian comedian
Willie Lancent, while not in the same class
as Wee Georgie Wood, is an ingenious fun-
maker, whose witicisms are doubtless being
stored up by unimaginative youths for the
delectation of giggling flappers. Phil Smith’s
latest revue, “On the Wheel,” an entertaining
commentary on matrimonial entanglements,
has the assistance of a captivating ballet, a
number of breezy tunes and a couple of good
humorists. The Newmans continue their
pugilistic capers on wheels, Grade Dorran is
as chic as ever, and Lyons and O'Moore are
a tolerable pair of patter merchants.
❖ * * *
“Broadway Gold” is glittering at Sydney
Lyceum, but the only aold about it is in the
pockets of the affinity whom the impecunious
chorus girl annexes. In the supporting British
film Betty Balfour, as the Cockney flower-girl
who is elected to the House of Commons, is at
her best. In “Hearts of Oak,” at the Lyric,
a magnanimous husband joins an expedition
to the North Pole in place of the usurper of
his wife’s affections and meets a frozen end.
Hoyt’s are presenting Zane Grey’s “Wan-
derer of the Wasteland,” which is entirely
filmed in color. Betty Compson, at the
Empress, is busy debating which of two men
she will take for life. “The Rose of Paris,”
blooming at the Strand, is the story of what
happened to an impressionable maiden after
she left the seclusion of a convent. “Gerald
Cranston’s Lady” is receiving guests at the
CrysM Palace, and “The Ten Command-
ments” ip still at the Prince Edward.

A show Sydney is to see:—
On January 26 the Australian War Museum,
which has been housed after a fashion in an insigni-
ficant wing of the Melbourne Exhibition building,
will be moved on to the Sydney Exhibition in Prince
Alfred Park, after which it will take up its quarters
at Canberra. It is to be hoped that the display
will be properly accommodated in Sydney instead of
the exhibits being piled one on top of another, as
they are in Melbourne. Practically all the material
used in the war is shown, from the hand-made jam-
tin bombs of Gallipoli to the big guns which sent
shells over 20 miles—from Dickiebusch to Ostend,
for instance. There are paintings of battle scenes
and personalities by all the Australian artists who
were roped in for W'ork in the War Records section —
some of them remarkably bad paintings, according
to the reputation of the artists, but many showing
a wonderful vigor. Then there are the amazing
photographs secured by Captain Wilkins, who some-
times took up a position in No Man’s Land, where
he would get all the "dirt” from both sides, in
order to “snap” a hopover. Models of the country
over which the Australians fought, and of various
battlefields and trenches, are particularly interesting.
One, recently added, shows the country from Meteeren
(which is just missed) to north of Ypres, but
oddly enough, the marking of such places as Messines,
Neuve Eglise, Dranoutre (a teeming centre of A.I.F.
life at one time) and Strazeele have been overlooked.
Nor is the place where Hill 60 used to be indicated,
although it was one of the most interesting spots
of the war. Some stars to show the location of the
big craters formed when enemy trenches were blown
up, at the start of the Messines stunt, would also
be useful—-Australian engineers were prominent in
that work. Guns, displays of weapons and uniforms,
pocket articles which miraculously saved lives, shat-
tered muzzles, and other things which show the
destructive force of shellfire are there in hundreds ;
a mere few of them exhibited in a city shop windo v
would be sufficient to hold up traffic. As the exhibi
tion .is entered, a German land periscope lifting 20
feet into the air shows prominently; further back is
the magnificent ’plane in which Ross and Keith
Smith made their England to Australia flight; and
there are also ’planes of all types for close inspection.
This writer found some German observation-posts
that at a distance would pass for trees, and they
set him recalling a baffling device he saw at Voor-
mezeele, and another at Rose Wood, below Wyschaete
• —o.p’s. so cunningly made that a keen observer
might approach within a few yards without any
suspicion that they were merely camouflaged steel
cylinders, with a ladder inside for the observer to
reach the top. It is a matter for regret that the
A.I.F. could not secure at least cne of these
miracles of Hun ingenuity. However, the show is
very fine, although the arrangement could hardly be
worse. And it is a show to be seen by all Aus-
tralians, since it brings home the horrors of war
to tne younger generation, reminds stay-at-homes
of what their brothers suffered and of what is due
to those who are still suffering, and is a silent but
most eloquent witness against the folly of those who,
careless of their country’s safety, think that it will
be time enough to prepare for an invasion when the
invader is here.

“The Outsider,” at Melbourne Royal, con-
tinues to excite the approval of persons who
dislike the medical profession. And prosper-
ous-looking quacks ivho “practise” in mys-
terious haek-parlors are there to enjoy the
acclamations of the people who provide their
comfortable livings.
“Good Morning, Dearie,” seems likely to
collect good money at His Majesty’s, Mel-
bourne, for some time to come.

“Trelawney of the Wells” is waiting to
succeed “The Truth about Blayds,” at Mel-
bourne King's. A Melbourne bookseller tells
a yarn apropos of Milne’s play. To a rich
customer he waggishly said that he had re-
ceived an order for the collected works of
Oliver Blayds, preferably the 1863 edition.
The customer did not smile. “If you have got
that edition in stock,” he replied, “you had
better send it round to me, too.”

A Fairy Queen who recalls the well-
nourished fay in “lolantlie” —the same that
swings on a cobweb and nestles in a walnut-
shell —puts “Cinderella” in the way of
going to the Prince’s ball, and annexing

bourne. She looks like repeating the pro-
cess for many nights to come.

The Hawaiian Troubadours, now at Mel-

cided that the show is good.

The double handful of hard workers who
provide “The Midnight Frolics,” at the New
Palace, Melbourne, have added a topical skit
on cricket to their revels. It isn’t an amaz-
ingly good skit, but, at a time when the
Test match has driven Melbourne cricket-
mad, it is on a good wicket.

Adelaide amusements are mostly an orgy
of Variety at low prices, Billy Maloney hav-
ing a co. at Austral Gardens and Humphrey
Bishop one at the Exhibition Gardens, both
open-air and in the evening. Then there
are George Wallace (a really clever com-
edian) with a mixed bag at the Majestic and
a bright lot at the Royal. The Prince of
Wales’s has re-opened with a pantomime,
“Robinson Crusoe.” mostly run by children ;
and the Town Hall is being crowded to hear
Granforte, Picc.aluga and others of the
former opera co., now on a return concert
visit.
“Munjong”: No doubt about Yiddish being
extensively used and understood in Australia
(B. 4/12/24). About seven years ago a
Jewish opera co. staged several plays in the
King’s Theatre, Sydney. The night I went
the house was packed and the audience in-
tensely appreciative. The play was written
entirely in Yiddish.
“Hamfat” : Lawrence Power, who, accord-
ing to Alfred Hill, has “a world voice,” is
now more or less definitely attached to the
Melbourne pictures as an extra attracljon.
Some time next year he will go to England
to have the voice polished. But for his sudden
success in singing, Power might this year
be playing inter-State cricket for S.
Australia.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The impression of small-
ness Josie Melville gives may be partly an
illusion ; but she is fortunate, all the same,
that stage standards have altered. A score
of years ago a certain ampleness was re-
garded as a necessity for feminine per-
formers ; even in serious drama the girl who
was small could not be anything but a
soubrette. Those who were unfortunate in
inches used to try to rectify the defect by
elevating themselves with extra heels on
their shoes when on the stage or interviewing
managers; but I recall one particularly
clever girl who could not get a look-in be-
cause of her lack of elevation—managers
turned her down on that account without
even considering what she might be able to
do. She got a trial, however, with a show
in which her newly-made husband had an
interest, and then the managers who had
scorned her offered contracts. Interesting
family events caused her to drop out just
when the opportunity she had long unavail-
ingly sought came her way.
“Hamfat”: When mummers keep a little
Church Round the Corner in mind it is
nowadays often of the Christian Science
persuasion. In London and New York
Christian Science has become surprisingly
popular in the thespian world; and Aus-
tralian stageland contains many devotees.
But I have yet to meet a manager who be-
lieves that simple faith will draw him a good
house. Managers prefer to rely upon the
simple 'faith of the public in what they
advertise.
“Nikko”: My suburban picture-theatre
was showing the usual comic film in which
the large and truculent lady terrorises her
undersized husband. The delighted yells of
the audience awakened a seedy-looking indi-
vidual who had strayed in from the hotel
next door to sleep it off. He gazed at the
picture in amazement. “Thasli her,” he
shouted. “Thasli my wife !” A kindly neigh-
bor explained that it couldn’t possibly be the
lady he knew, as the film came from Holly-
wood, but the seedy one was unshaken.
“Thasli Clara,” he asserted, “thasli how she
useter treat me. She ran away with Bill
Smith, an’ now she’s wallopin’ Bill. Go it,
Clara ! Hit him, the scoundrel!” The usher
arrived just then, and the seedy one was
ejected. But his swagger as he went left
no doubt that lie felt Clara was nobly aveng-
ing his wrongs.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The growth of the
trade-union spirit among actors has made
the amateur who is prepared to pay for the
privilege of appearing on the stage less of a
nuisance than formerly. Not long ago a
whole company threatened strike if an en-
thusiast who had been picked up to fill a
small part wasn’t paid a salary, the conten-
tion being that there were professionals who
would be glad of the job; and the proprietary
caved in. But theatrical managements still
get some curious offers. Recently a one-
line part was offered to a gilded youth who
looked and dressed well. “Delaighted!” he
said eagerly; “but what will it cost me?”
He was astonished when told that he would
get tlje award rate, and on the first night he
took a couple of rows of stalls that his friends
might be entranced at his delivery of the
words “Telegram for you, sir,” or something
of the sort.
“Hamfat”: New Plymouth (M.L.) now
has a brand-new theatre; but the old Royal
was remarkable for having a stage with one
of the steepest “rakes” in Australia. The
Leigh-Douglas Co. (Herbert Leigh is still
going as a character man with sundry shows,
but Harry Douglas is gone) once put up
“East Lynne” there as an extra bill. A
strange urchin was bribed at the last moment
to have his face cleaned and be popped into
a nightgown and Little Willie’s death-bed. a
lady of the show getting under the bed, which
had a quilt hanging well over the auditorium
side, to speak the lines. The big incline on
the stage, new castors on the bed, and the
clinging habits of Rose Phillips, who was
Lady Isabel-Madame Vine, led to the tragedy.
As she leaned against the bed it started on its
run towards the footlights, the' girl under-
neath having to do a desperate crawl to pre-
vent exposure; and finally it finished right in
the footlights, with the kid fixing his wide-
open, fearful eyes on the drop curtain which
trembled ready to descend. “Look at me.
Willie! lam your sorrowing, heart-broken
mother!” declaimed Isabel. (“Close your
eyes, dear!” she whispered.) “Ah, dead!
(Close your eyes, dear !) Dead and” But

the quivering curtain, which was one of the
old roller type, was too terrifying. The
dead Willie sat up suddenly and wailed, “I
want to go home!” And a hilarious audi-
ence had a view as the curtain did drop of
Archibald Carlyle, Francis Levison and Lord
Mount Severn combining efforts to drag the
bed out of the way, whilst the dead che-ild
hurled himself out of it and, in a nightie
sizes too big for him, made a bolt for safety.

The Company has been formed for the purpose amongst, other things of financing sales
of motor-cars, lorries and motor-vehicles and the lending of the Company’s funds upon
approved securities to companies and persons engaged in the Motor Trade. This “loan
service” proposition is neither new nor experimental, and is meeting with remarkable
success in England, America and elsewhere. The proposition is simplicity itself, being
purely a matter of finance. There are three separate and distinct sources of profit to be
made on each loan to the purchaser of a motor-car, any one of which should pay a satisfac-
tory return on the money invested, but these three sources combined are sufficient to place
the business in a class by itself.
CAPITAL.— The Nominal Capital of the Company is ONE MILLION POUNDS. The
Company has not been in existence one month, yet the reception which has been accorded
the proposition warrants the conclusion that FIVE MILLION POUNDS will be required
for the Motor industry, and can be placed on most lucrative terms to the investors.
SHARE ISSUE—ISO.OOO Ordinary and 50,000 Cumulative 9 per cent. Participating
Preferential Shares (less such number as have already been applied for) are ottered tor
subscription. The terms on which both classes of shares are offered for subscription are as
follows: £1 per share on application and 5/- per share on balance in calls of not
exceeding 2/6 per share at intervals of not less than one month until such time as such
shares are paid up to £2/10/- per share, and thereafter the balance remaining unpaid may he
called up in calls not exceeding 2/6 per share at intervals of not less than three months.
SUCCESS OF SIMILAR ENTERPRISES.— The Commercial Credit Company of Baltimore,
n.S.A., was organised in 1912 with £50.000 capital. To-day the capital is £1.200,000, with a
surplus of £250.000. For the past twelve years the original Ordinary Shareholders have
received 102 per cent, in cash dividends and 105 per cent, in share dividend. An original
investment of £2OO in shares of the company now has a market value of £Bll.
The Pacific Finance Corporation of Los Angeles sold its shares when it was organised in
1920 at £1 a share. To-day the shares are worth £9 each, an increase of 800 per cent. Many
other companies of similar character are paying huge dividends to tneir shareholders 1 lie
Continental Guaranty Corporation, of 248 Madison Avenue. New York, D.b.A., statejthat out.of
122 659 cars on which they had loaned money, they had to reclaim only 110, and that in tne
majority of these re-possessions the salvage realised from the sale ot passenger car or truck
was sufficient to liquidate the corresponding obligation and save any loss to the Corporation.
ESTIMATE OF PROFITS. —Report by Mr. H. B. Smith. A.C.1.A., of Sydney, Public
Accountant, is given in full in the prospectus. After giving particulars of Ins figures, he
concludes, “so that in eight years after allowing for all expenses, commissions, etc-, together
with dividends from 9 per cent, to 25 per cent., there should be a reserve fund belonging to
shareholders to the amount of £203,980.

FOR four consecutive years the P. & C. has created new records in new
business for Life Offices of equal age, a fact which testifies to the
Company’s popularity with the “Man on the Land.”
These results are due to the facts that P. & C. policies are specially designed
to fit the particular needs of the Farmer and Grazier; that such policies are
unusually liberal, due to the co-operative basis of the Company; that the
Company is thoroughly sound and associated with the leading co-operative
bodies of the Commonwealth which represent the backbone of the country’s
prosperity.

“Hamfat”: To Charlie Westmacott if)
Riven the credit of having conveyed the sack
to an unwanted mummer in the nicest pos-
sible fashion—as if it were an ornamental
travelling-case, so to speak. The actor-r
was an importation who had proved an un-
speakable failure. Westmacott, with the
nasty job on his hands, asked him how ho
liked Australia. “It’s rotten,” grumbled the
thespian, “but the worst thing in the blanky
country are the moskeeters. They won’t let me
get to sleep. I feel that if I have another
week of it I’ll go mad.” Westmacott was
all sympathy. “If that’s the case,” he said,
“you’ll be quite glad to catch the boat back
to England next Tuesday, won’t you?”
William Archer, dramatic critic, apostle
of Ibsen and son of a Queensland squatter
who was at one time Bananaland’s Agent-
General. is dead in England. Archer’s only
plaj r , “The Green Goddess,” is at present
being performed in Sy ney. Its plot is
melodramatic, but its dialogue is in th.e fine
satiric vein which so exasperated the Philis-
tines of Fogopolis when Archer wrote for
the Observer. The thing brought him a lot
of American and British money during the
last 18 months, but the probabilities are that
he didn’t need it, his father having left him
comfortably off.

SECOND CRITIC: “Gee! I though you were

“Te Pana”: With the advent of press-
agents, Sunday newspapers and half-tone
blocks, the necessity for the pro. to wear
noisy clothing in the street for publicity pur-
poses has been removed. Actors used to sport,
frockcoats, tight checked pants, a day's
growth of whiskers, long hair and wide-
brimmed felt hats. Nowadays they depend
on illustrations in the papers to familiarise
the public with their off-stage appearance,
and, barring American vaudevillains, who
still encase their frames in startling outfits,
most of the mummers Australia knows would
pass for Y.M.C.A. students.
“Caesar's Ghost”: The French uniforms in
the J. C. Williamson production of “Briga-
dier Gerard” were voted a nuisance by the
actors who wore them. Between acts they
had to be powdered over to simulate the
dust of campaigning in a country with white
roads ; and, mindful of the fact that they had
to be gaudy again in the last act, the mum-
mers used the fuller’s earth sparingly.
Williamson noticed this at rehearsal, and
made some cutting remarks. Next day
Napoleon’s army found him waiting by a
second-hand zinc bath, which was half-filled
with a powdery substance. “Now, gentle-
men of the Guard, I want you to look like
real dusty soldiers,” he told them. “Each
of jmu get into that tub and roll in it.”
There was no doubt about the dustiness at
the night performance.
“Caul Buoy”: Those Red Page writers
who have been discussing the psychology of
mirth missed one point—the cumulative effect
of the laughter of a crowd on the risible facul-
ties. Its importance can be discovered at
any dress rehearsal of any musical comedy.
I have seen even a pressman join in the
roars of laughter that convulse a first-night
audience, although the same man has sat
cold and critical at a rehearsal. And two
famous comedians, whose mere shadows
flung on to any Australian stage are suffi-
cient to cause an explosion of merriment,
struck me as pathetically commonplace
figures, whose dialogue sounded as empty
as the auditorium, when stripped of their
audiences. The demigods of mirth are not
those who say or do the funniest things, but
those who can place all their fingers on the
mysterious instrument that controls the
crowd’s psychology.
“Centurion”: “The Eight that Failed” was
not the only Kipling work that the author
tried to dramatise (B. 25/12/’24). He made
a good job of his short story “The Man Who
Was,” a yarn of an English Hussar officer,
taken prisoner in the Crimean War, and
sent to Siberia, who turns up, 30 years later,
a semi-insane wreck at the mess of his old
regiment at Peshawar. The play had a
pretty good run in London.
“A.11.H.”: The applause which greets sug-
gestions of violence on the stage, particularly
towards women, raises the suspicion that
there is a streak of sadism even in the
mildest-mannered denizen of Suburbia. In
“The Rise of Rosie O’Reilly,” at Sydney
Opera House, the audience obviously enjoys
the spectacle of an Apache dancer clubbing
his partner on the head and throwing her
into the river with a realistic splash. In
fact, the outrage whets its appetite for a tit-
bit in the same scene where an Italian
cabaret-keeper livens up another dance by
cracking a whip round the supple curves of
his partner. In melodrama the whipping of
anybody—a woman especially—raises a
shudder ; it always did so in “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin.” But with the sensuous accompani-
ment of music and color it seems to add spice
to a modern song-and-dance show.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The proposals of mar-
riage with which actresses are understood
to be deluged through the post are mostly
imagined by the press-agent, but I saw a
real one recently. It made no boasts of
diamonds, stately mansions and expected
millions; the enraptured young man admit-
ted, in fact, that he had nothing to
offer—not even the salary from a job—but
he thought that, with the money the actress
had no doubt saved, they could start a
theatrical co., of which he could be manager.
There was another youth whose offer of
matrimony was handed to the publicity man
for derisive treatment. Came a second letter
to the faithless stage girl, and it was cutting.
“My proposal was inspired by your wretched
acting,” the rejected one wrote. “I felt that
if I could only induce you to leave the stage
I would be sacrificing myself in the public
interest.” When an actress receives a letter
like that she feels as if a sheep had bitten
her.
“Sierra” : “Oh, Once I Loved a Dark-eyed
Sailor” was another heartrending song of
80-odd years ago. The erring lydy answers
the sailor’s reproaches in the refrain
Go and leave me if you wi-ish it,
Never let me keross your mi-ind;
If you deem me so unwor-herthy,
Go and leave me—never mi-ind.
Sung by slightly sober tarts in London’s
East End, it was very affecting. Many times
I have seen it draw tears from ancient rum-
sozzled seamen in the pubs of Ratcliff High-
way.
“Hamfat”: An Australian mummer, still
in the business, once saved himself from
unemployment by a neat quip. For purely
personal reasons ,T. C. Williamson angrily
sacked him one night, but the offender turned
up at the theatre next day as if nothing had
happened. .Timmy’s anger had subsided
slightly, and, instead of the blast of pro-
fanity which everyone expected, he drew the
actor aside and asked what he damn well
meant —didn’t he remember being sacked '!
“Oh, I i-emember, Mr. Williamson,” said the
culprit, “but I thought I must have been
drunk and seen two of you. If you under-
stand what I mean, you seemed to be beside
yourself.” .T.C.W. walked away grinning, and
the actor stayed with the Firm for years.
‘Caesar’s Ghost”: A girl now filling a
minor niche in a Melbourne show was
literally born on the stage. Her parents
were members of a co. which was so desper-
ately up against it when touring Queens-
land that ma had to keep going up to the
last extremity, and the youngster inter-
rupted the progress of “The Colleen Bawn”
by arriving 111 one of the dressing-rooms.
The audience, to whom the interesting event
was announced by way of apology for some-
body else reading Anne Chute’s lines, took
the subsequent mix-up verv liindlv’ and
afterwards the town gave the show a benefit
THE WRONG MEDIUM.
CANVAS: “What arc the water-color crowd doing to-night?"
HOGSHAIR : “They reckon they're going to paint the town red.
CANVAS: “ Whot! Them? With wator-color!”
that put it on its feet. The young woman
is not the stage genius she should be to
conform with her origin, but she does what
is expected of her prettily enough.
“S. Gumm” : I am tired of reading that
Slimkins, the English dancing comedian, who
returned to Cockaigne a few months ago to
fire its muddy river, has accepted another
engagement in Australia because he felt lost
without our glorious sunshine. The state-
ment that Miss Highsea, the Australian
soprano, has the poorest opinion of the lead-
ing ladies she saw in London likewise wearies
me, as also does the remark of Blithers, the
manager, that there wasn’t a show in Broad-
way that would run two nights in Newtown.
For my own morbid satisfaction I have
varied these tedious utterances as follows:
Bertie Slimkins, who arrived by the s.s. Jobcontrol
after an unexpectedly short stay in his native
London, has been engaged for the silly-ahss part in
“Carrie, the Cash-girl.” “Why did I come back?”
he said with a rueful smile. “Because I couldn’t
get another shop, and a man can’t live on press-
agent’s guff alone. I tried every manager I could
think of in my line of business—did that dance
with the twiddly-bits that went so big in ‘Saign,
Please’-—and it would pain me to repeat some of
their brutal comments. But at last I struck a man
who had known me in the old days when I helped in
the office. ‘Slimmy,’ he says, ‘your work makes me
yawn, and the only job I can offer you is on the
door; but Boom, the Australian, is in town —I
met him at the Sports Club to-day—and is looking
for a Johnnie who can shake his legs about a bit.
Get on his track before the others beat you to
him.’ I went straight to the Sports Club, had the
good luck to find Boom in, and here I am. I saw
him fust.”
Interviewed' in her Russell-square hotel by the
representative of the Moon, Miss Highsea went into
raptures over the London stage-ladies. Jose Collins,
she said, was a peach, and Cicely Debenham, Delysia,
Phyllis Dare, that girl in “The Beggar’s Opera”—
she forgot her name —and half a dozen others were
dinkum actresses. As for Sybil Thorndike and Fay
Compton, they were great. Did she herself intend
tr try her luck on the London boards ? Not she!
“For one thing,” Miss Highsea confided, “I’d have
to take ,orf about 17 pounds—the people here likes
’em a lot slimmer than I am. Then I’d have to
Polish up me enunciation, which isn’t what it
oughter be. And where’s the London manager who’d
come to light with a hundred a week? Let me
tell y’, kiddo, your Highsea knows when she’s well
off. She’s goin’ back to dear ole Aussie where the
good mugs are.”
“No,” said Blithers, the manager, on his return
from the U.S.A., “I haven't bought the rights of
any of the reigning Broadway successes. Half of
those I saw would be above the heads of our audiences,
and the other half would cost so much to produce
supposing we could produce them 75 per cent,
below the Broadway standard—that we’d never get our
money back. No; I’ve got a couple of jazz-comedies
that have had a pretty good run in Cheyenne,
Wyoming, and Little Rock, Arkansas. And the
principals are coming direct from South Dakota—
they were doing rather well there till the crops
failed.”
“A.P.”: Melbourne Athenaeum, now re-
sounding to the ukulele and other Hawaiian
noises, harbored
the first attempts
at public music-
making by early
Melburnians. That
was. in 1843. The
original society paid
£270 for two half-
acre blocks in
Collins-street at a
Government land
sale in 1S40; it
retained 66 feet by
355 feet for build-
ing, and sold the
rest at a profit.
The old hall lasted
until 1872, and its
successor li a d a
musical history of
half a century be-
fore its light was
dimmed by the pre-
sent natty little
theatre.
“F.L.H.”: Men-
tion of Bland Holt
in recent pars,
prompted me to
dig up a pro-
gramme of Paul
Merritt’s “T h c
New Babylon,”
with Bland at the
head in his part of
Flotsam. T here
were 10 characters
in the prologue,
and 30 more in the
drama. Some were
doubled, of course,
but it took about
25 principals to
carry on, and then
there were extras:
Madame Franzini,
a cyclist, and James
Buproil with a
troupe of trained
dogs. I wonder
what it would cost
to stage a show
like that in these days of “award” rates and
hours. A cast that held the equals of Holt,
IT. H. Vincent, Searle, J. L. Hall, Myra
Kembi: and Laura Wiseman —to mention a
few —with its score of supporters, would
have present-day managers moaning that they
would never get their money back. Another
of those thrillers of the ’eighties, Dion
Boucicault’s “Formosa,” took 2(5 people to
work out its destiny, and the production had
Hoskins, Stoneham, Stuart O’Brien and
Marian Willis in it. If anyone wants to re-
light the ashes of bellowdrammer he must
write for a personnel of seven or eight and no
trained animals.
“Elephant's Breath”: Allow me to take
off a reverential hat to the chorus-ladies’ legs.
They are almost the last public spectacle
that remains to us as a relic of the Greek
Games, whose glorifying of healthy nudity
did _so much for art, science, surgery and
sanity in the ancient world. When this final
sturdy bulwark is torn down by the wowsers
we will doubtless be ripe for the invasion of
Chinese conceptions of beauty. The Chinese
regard a robust frame, indicating brute force,
as incompatible with the character of a
student and a gentleman, so they cultivate
a stooping gait and wear plain glass spec-
tacles, if they don’t need real ones, as a mark
of culture. They crumple the feet of their
girls from babyhood—the pain of the pro-
cess is so great that the victim is sometimes
relegated to an outhouse so that her cries
will not upset the household —and bind their
breasts tightly to give them a fragile appear-
ance ; the boys get off lightly by having the
backs of their heads flattened with boards
arranged like a vice. Chorus-girls, of course,
never existed on the Chinese stage: their
place was always taken by boys.
“Fouram” (London) : Frieda Hempel,
whom I heard in New York, is having great
success over here, her pure soprano and great
fluency being effectively used in the interpre-
tation of very varied and exacting pro-
grammes, ranging from Brahms and Bach to
“Dixie,” which latter number she sings with
extraordinary vim, making it difficult for the
people to keep their seats. She is a superb
artist. She has the advantage in London of
flute accompaniments by John Amadio, of
Melbourne, in my opinion the greatest flautist
I have ever heard. His lower notes are
quite organ-like, and in the upper range the
delicacy of his tone is indescribable.
YEAR-END CARNIVAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In all the rippling murmurs of the throng,
With outflung laughter rising softly sweet,
Whilst the light-spangled joyance speeds along
Rhythmed to the leaping pulse and dancing feet,
There sobs a note of sadness in my heart;
For old Regret, with harp beside his knees,
Sings me a song of dole to make it smart
Of days when simple joys were more than these.
It needed not the lilting of a band
To flood our hearts with music years ago;
But as we wandered softly, hand in hand,
Our hearts themselves made such a music flow
That all the world for us was carnival
And all the dazzling lanterns of the sky
Swing to its lilt. Like laughter seemed the fall
Of soft-blown breezes as they passed us by.
Music, joy, laughter rest within the soul.
When man first strung with strings his harp ol
gold
He sought again to bring to his control
Those raptures lost the heart should ever hold,
To coax again the ecstasies once known
When in himself gushed music like a spring;
But found a note of sadness in its tone,
An echo of his loss on every string.

Commence the New Year Well!
New Year resolutions are generally broken
and forgotten in the first week. There is
nothing substantial in mere resolve. The
farmer, however, who starts the year right—
in a practical way, by the purchase of a
“Ctctrac” has something really worth while —
and not for one year only! “Cletrac's”
durability is well known. Years of good
service is a feature of this wonderful TANK
TYPE TRACTOR. Its all round capacity is
amazing!—“Cletrac” actually replaces eight
horses, for every day in the year, if necessary.
By reason of its power pulley it is enabled
to saw wood, pump water, grind feed, thresh
the grain, and is fitted for endless use about
the farm. It runs on kerosene —the upkeep
being only about half the cost of horse feed
—and is ever ready for the job!

sentences won’t bear analysis. .. .Wanderer: Well, we
won’t swear that one of them ever carried a swag,
but we’ll swear that the other was many years at sea.
. ...T.O’D.: Before an indictment for perjury would
lie, the subject-matter would have to (1) be given
in evidence and (2) be relevant to the issue.
Apparently the statements admitted to be untrue
were not put in as evidence, but were amended and
truthful statements substituted for them... .Two Star:

Verse doesn’t strike us. .. .F.W. (Mary Valley Line) :
You have no idea of verse and a very poor notion
of using the Engl/ish language... .11.G.8.: ,The
recording of a few grunts and screeches from native
animals and the statement that night has started
is not exactly the sort of thing to move us to
ecstasy... .M.J. (Ouyeu) : You must find something
to write about; the best verses about nothing—•
and yours are only middling—are not worth print.
... .David M.: Doesn’t strike us... .D.E.8.: No good.
....Rita C.: You contrive to make that homestead
very dreary... .A.8.C.: Not up by a long way....
A.E.P.: Below par... .Alan W.: Doesn’t strike u 5....
G. : Your meaning is a deep mystery....
K. ; Both miss.. . .A.G.M.: It falls all over its
own feet both in metre and meaning.... D.M.G. :
Not up... .Ripponlea: It has a fine vigorous opening:
The young husband expressed nausea vile,
“Sardines again!” he said with a sardonic smile.
“Well, I played Mah Jongg with Mrs. Watson,
So I didn’t have time to put any pots on.”
“I feel like bally well putting your pot on,
For your method of housekeeping is dashed rotten.”
“Now, dearest,” she stammer’d, “don’t get sore or
I’ll feel you don’t love little wife any more.”
He said in disgust, “You do raise mine ire,
Why, I’d laugh like Hell if your hair was on fire.”
He gave a short laugh, then took a long breath ;
■ “Yes! I love you so much I could kick j r ou to death.”
She knelt on the hearthstone and did start to sob,
While her husband just called her a mutt and a blob;
Her slobb’ring sob in her arms did she smother
And croaked “Swelp me Bob, I’m going home to
Mother.” t
. ...Agart: Doesn’t suit us... .H.H.W.: The
Pommy’s lament, with its suggestion that Australian
girls can’t kiss without malice, is howded in very
poor verse Homfrey B.: The verse is not quite
well enough done....U.C. (Christchurch): “Dead”
doesn't move us... .A.P. (Tamworth): Not enough in
it... .D.P.M.: One held for inquest... .Inspiration:
Moves in a heavy and clumsy fashion... .Moyah K.:
Very bad verse... .F.J. (Lindfield): Well enougn
constructed, but not interesting....B.W. (Vic.) : No
good to us. ...A.J.: Can’t advise you to continue.
. ...E.C.D.: So many words to express so little....
T.K.M.: Ah, this was something like a find:—
Then we saw the ship of romance
Sail to us
Quite silently,
And we stepped aboard the dream ship,
Turned her prow unto the eastward
From the lea,
Sailing distant through the night
Glad we were when morning’s light
Shone upon us dazzling bright,
AVhile we joyfully saw the sunshine
’Cross the sea.
And we found the thing we came for
’Neath the sea,
By cold stones three,
And the treasure that we found there
More than recompensed our labors
O’er the sea;
For we found the crimson circlet,
Band of gold inlaid with sapphire,
That was all of our desire,
Left by old Melanesian peoples
’Neath the sea.
... .M.J.D.: Don’t touch them. It is a gamble, and,
on your own account, you can’t afford,to gamble....
Q.R.: No rhyme and less reason.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.S.: So you think Baldwin and Uncle Sam should
be represented as devils stirring up innocent Japan
with redhot pokers. In 30 years your peaceful little
nation has fitted herself with a first-class army and
the third largest navy; has tried them in two
foreign wars; has taken Formosa, Korea and the
Manchurian railway; has invaded Siberia, occupied
Shantung and Russian Sakhalien, and acquired the
Luehu, Marshall and other islands of immense
strategic value. By contrast, the Singapore base has
the bellicosity of a back-yard fence and the aggressive-
ness of a garden gate W.G. (Papua) : Your types
are good, but the lack of feeling in the shading
starves the promising drawing. Try again
J.A.McK.: It wrecked our New Year resolution to
refrain from angry words T.F.: Chinese ladies are
the only ones we know who have hands twice as
big as their feet.

“Associate B. J.A.” : What a nice seasonal ;
present the Australian banks get by being
closed for eight days at Christmas and New
Year! Interest on deposits that fall due
during the holidays stops the day the f.d.r.
matures, but interest on the overdraft or
other advance doesn’t cease. For the eight
days when a fellow can’t pay off either Ins
interest or his overdraft interest at 7 p.c.
on 271 million pounds of loans amounts to
£410,000!
* * * *
“Crank Shaft” : During 1923 the world’s
petrol supply was decreased by 38,000 million
gallons, of which Uncle Sam consumed two-
tliirds. It is a little surprising to find Maon-
land burning up 20.3 gallons per inhabitant
compar 1 with Australia’s 9.2 gallons, but
the figures are insignificant beside those of
the Yank, who consumes 226 gallons.
Local power-alcohol may come presently;
meanwhile every Australian pound which
goes to purchase imported petrol helps the
oil magnates to make money and the Ameri-
can citizen to get his oil for 7d. per gallon.
* * * *
“Clerk”: “Loco” (B. 18/12/’24) mentions
some of the privileges and advantages V ic.
railway head-office clerks have over the out-
side staff. Here are some more which lie has
omitted. Our hours are a straight shift, 9
to 4.30; most of us haven’t the faintest idea
what work is (I exclude those branches, such
as the Secretary’s and the Betterment Board,
which are closely connected with Clapp), and
the pen-pusher who contents himself with
the bare threequarters of an hour for dinner
is regarded as a harmless eccentric. “Loco
can console himself with the reflection, how-
ever, that the male junior clerk in the head
offices will soon be a thing of the past.
Already the premises, formerly aggressively
masculine, can boast quite a respectable
array of jazz garters and shingled heads,
and the desponding male juniors are menaced
by the probability of transfer to the utter-
most parts of the State, with gloomy pros-
pects of having to work. It’s a hard life.
“Percy Pawnticket”: Whoever can hit
upon a new form of fraud in a world where
most swindles have been worn threadbare is
likely to fare better than the copyist. Some-
thing fairly original was “put over” in
Melbourne by a well-dressed man in a motor-
coat, who casually blew in upon various
strangers with the story that lie had run out
of. cash for petrol, and borrowed five bobs
here and there. Impressed by.the belief that
they were doing a small service to an opu-
lent car-owner, at least two score people, by
police computation, parted with their cash;
and probably only a small proportion of the
crook’s victims squealed. Some details about
the fraud had leaked into print when a
portly suburbanite was made almost apo-
plectic by having the game tried upon him.
The police gathered in the plausible gent,
who had attempted it; but when all the
earlier victims declared that he was not their
man, they accepted his statement that he
had been inspired to work the trick by seeing
it reported in the press. The more astute
pioneer had probably sought a new field for
his activities long before.
* * * *
“Giniuba” : The rise in the price of mother-
of-pearl shell is welcome news for many
dinkum Aussies who have staked their all in
the industry. For over four years the dis-
organised condition of Europe has played
havoc with the market for both shell and
pearls ; Japanese “culture pearls” have further
decreased the demand for the genuine article.
But the Old World is beginning to sit up and
take notice again, and it will mean a good
deal to the big-liearted men who toil and sweat
along Australia’s northern rim, although for
many the recovery has come too late: their
luggers have been gobbled up by the better-
gilded folk who do their pearling behind
bank and store counters. The rise in price
has sent up the pearl production of Papua
also. Most of the gems in that quarter
are dredged from the Trobriand Lagoon,
which sent away £16.000 worth during the
first three months of 1924. Most of this money
was distributed amongst the half-dozen pearl
tradei’s located on Kiriwina Island, who buy
from the native fishers, Papua’s paternal Gov-
ernment having given these a monopoly of
pearling in this group. Trobriand pearls are
not the product of in.o.p., but are manufac-
tured by a small mussel known locally as
lapi. A peculiar feature about the Trobri-
ands is the prevalence of pearls in the shells
of varied species. I have a glorious, pink
pearl that came out of a giant helmet shell-;
and German Harry, a former Papuan trader,
had a collection of pink, red, brown, orange,
black, lead, slate and porcelain-white gems
picked up in these parts,
A CONSIDERATION OF WET WEATHER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Our Australian weather’s made
On a large, extensive plan ;
Orass shows either not a blade . ..
Or enough to hide a man.
ltain is l ain; and rain it can
Once the proper tune is played—
Our Australian weather’s made
On a most extensive plan.
When tne rain has reached the rock
It can go no farther down.
Save the surplus floods to mock
Every drought that tries to brown
The good green that is the crown
Of the year’s endeavor. Stock,
Though the rain has reached the reck,
Perish when the seasons frown.
Weather moist or warm and bland
On the average is kind;
If we want to save the land
We must bear the fact in mind.
British chance is hard and blind;
We must take our luck in hand,
Make the weather understand
That our own intent is kind.
When we really strike a drought
There is safety in a dam;
Hottest wind can’t blow us out
If we store up every dram
Of the rain that made salaam
To a land that felt no doubt
It was master of all drought.
Dam is safer far than damn!

“Billy See”: Westralia is also supplying
an outsize in claimants: tlio Horrocks bro-
thers sailed for England six months ago to
advance their title to an estate alleged to
be valued at something like 40 millions.
Bonds were sold at £lO each, redeemable at
£lOO “in the event,” etc., and the long onus
found takers. The pair are the sons ot a
Horrocks claimant who emigrated to Aus-
tralia, finally pulling up at Walhalla (Vic.),
where the present candidates for opulence
were born.
“Harold Hardupp”: The hopeful stow-
away has lost his old-time chance of working
his passage and having his sins wiped out
with sweat. To-day, unless he escapes dis-
covery (as he sometimes does), there is
almost certain gaol ahead of him. The posi-
tion was set forth in a recent case in whicli
a man stowed himself on the Niagara to get
from M.L. to Sydney without paying Ins
fare: had the man been put to work, it was
explained, the ship would be compelled to
pay compensation for any injury he might
receive. It is not merely that a raw hand
is more likely to be injured than a trained
seaman; the shipping cos. fear trickery.
Some months ago a man who had stowed
away and been allowed to work his passage
injured his hand and managed to malinger,
and so obtained compensation for a long
stretch of alleged incapacity.
“Centurion”: Lord Carson has been say-
ing a word or two in the House of Lords
about the extent to which junior civil ser-
vants in Britain are held in pawn by money-
lenders. It’s just about as true of the Aus-
tralian services, as anyone who has watched
the fortnightly vigil of Israel’s jackals in
the corridors of any Government office can
testify. Terms are probably lighter here,
though; a friend who recently borrowed £lO
has only to pay back £l5 in fortnightly
instalments of £l.
“Peecie”: The torturing properties of hot
water poured into the ear seem to have been
unknown to Torquemada. But at the Bruis-
ing of Beef inquiry held in Brisbane last
month one witness stated that he had seen
boiling water poured into the ear of a
bullock which would or could not'rise. Men-
tion was also made of the coal used by the
Queensland railways, which gives off large
cinders; these, falling into the trucks, are
liable to make the beasts lame. One station-
owner advocated closer packing of the hap-
less animals; this would make it impossible
for even an injured bullock to lie down
though the journey might be over a thou-
sand miles. Unfortunately dumb animals
cannot give evidence at Commissions, or we
might have had their view of this and other
proposals. Two humane suggestions were
that overhead tanks should be erected every
80 miles along the railway, so that in summer
the beasts could be douched; and that where
the journey lasted over a day the animals
should be detrucked.
“H.H.”: A Melbourne judgment regarding
the pursuit of outstanding fees by a trade
union will have a melancholy interest for
unionists who paid the levy for the Labor
Daily, believing they were legally liable.
The point raised in this case was that the
levy was never properly decided upon, and
the union confidently produced the minute-
book to show that it was. All the book
showed was that the Federal Council, of
which the union was a branch, had recom-
mended that a levy of 10s. per member should
be paid, and that the report of the delegates
to the Council had been adopted. Without
expressing an opinion as to whether that
sort of procedure would legalise ordinary
business, the Court decided that it was cer-
tainly no way to carry a special levy.
“Adamascus”: The Queensland inquiry
into the causes of bruising among trucked
cattle suggests that the trouble is caused
chiefly by horns. That once more points
to the value of dehorning. One hundred and
ninety steers which had been so treated
were trucked at Mundubbera and sent to
Brisbane, 280 miles away. They were all
practically unharmed, only one forequarter
and one hindquarter being rejected at the
meatworks. J. B. Cramsie says he is certain
meatworks will pay ss. per head more for
hornless cattle, and a similar amount more
for cattle which have been carefully branded.
There are a lot of graziers who believe, too,
that dehorned cattle fatten faster than
horned ones.
“Caloola” : The story of the goldfields store-
keeper who advertised that he sold “Bibles
and bacon, godly books and gimlets and all
sorts of hardware” may rank among the
chestnuts of past seasons, but the following
is a brand-new nut from the shop window of
a N.S.W. country storekeeper:—
The reason why I have been able to sell my goods
cheaper than anybody else is that I am a bachelor,
and do not need to make profit for the maintenance
of a wife and family. I now wish to inform the
public that this advantage will soon be withdrawn,
as I am about to be married. My advice is to lay
in a stock now before the prices rise.
“Lex” : Sydney Ferries takes its business
very seriously, and so it should, with so
many lives daily in its keeping. Recently,
however, it has introduced a little mild
humor of an unorthodox kind —unorthodox,
at least, for such a very respectable direc-
torate. Midway on the Cremorne ferry stage
it has erected an ingenious little advertising
show in which pictures and letterpress, all
highly colored, move in procession through
an electrically-lighted box. I had just missed
one boat and whilst waiting for the next
read the panorama as it passed. Came first
a “text” in which the sinner was urged to
repentance, followed by colored signs to
“Look!” and “Read!” another text, if any-
thing a little more urgent; and a third ar-
rived in which the sinner was reminded of
what would happen to him if he didn’t
hurry up and secure prompt salvation. Fol-
lowed a fourth, a sort of P.S., urging him
not to be late. All this, I reflected, the com-
pany is doing in atonement for its past sins:
what it is taking out of our pockets it is
putting into our souls. Then as the last cry
of “Salvation for sinners!” flicked past, up
jumped a scantily-skirted young woman flirt-
ing a pair of black-hosed legs in the air, and
across the picture in fine bold type the
words: “Pleasingly different.” I begin to
suspect there is scmethir.f Scotch somewhere
in this business.

Miss Dorothy Brunton,

She says her motto is
Rexona.
Girls! Why Not Enjoy
a Good Complexion?
You cannot if you do not care for the delicate skin of the face. When you
wash your face, do you realise that it is not enoirgh to simply remove the dirt,
but that your skin needs a soothing, healing influence to keep your complexion
fresh and free from blemish? Scented toilet soaps are often very pleasant, but
do not assert this influence, as you are well aware. Many of them contain free
alkali, which tends to dry up the skin and destroy its delicate texture.
Even the better class of such soaps do not in any way help to improve the
skin, but Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is not only an absolutely pure soap,
but is medicated on the same principle as the famous Rexona Ointment, which
is famous throughout all of Australasia as the Rapid Healer. That is why
Rexona Soap really does for the skin and face what cosmetics are supposed
to do, by ensuring not only a clean face, but a pure and healthy skin, and thus
gives you a clear complexion.

The House on the Hill.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WILLIAM’S house stands on a hill,
Where a big- man’s house should be,
Built for beauty with rare skill,
Head and shoulders o’er the sea.
Looking down, you take your fill
Of a valley low and long
Filled with magic. of bird-song.
William’s house from the hill-crown,
There aloof and there aloft
Like a brave man looking down.
Smiles on Vale and meadow croft,
Scrawny ridge and bracken-brown,
Meeting every storm that blows,
Resolute though in repose.
Something in the builder’s art,
Some white magic in the wood,
Fashioned it a human heart—
One of God’s make, clean and good
And from other homes apart
Even in windows and in floors
And in hospitable doors.
William’s house makes no great stir
When along the ribbon road
Thither wends this wanderer,
Weary, to the kind abode
Belted round with gum and fir.
Watching though without surprise,
Looking from its quiet eyes.
William’s house upon the peak
Seems, on coming round the turn,
Neither modern nor antique ;
Yet within its leafy urn
It has something of the Greek—
More suggested than defined—
Strength and beauty intertwined.
William’s house takes night and morn
With a cool philosophy,
Sees extinguished stars, re-born,
Hiving swarm above the sea,
Hears old Winter blow his horn,
Feels the green, insurgent Spring,
Tastes the Autumn’s garnering.
Terraces by flowers oppressed
Make an arbor all birds love;
Migrant wings find quiet rest
In the palms and gums above.
Such a happy place to nest,
Where, green-brinked with cress and clear,
Flows a creek through all the year.
Ho'-e the ivcka beats his drum
Nightly in the gully deeps.
Here the shining cuckoos come;
Here day-long the kiwi sleeps.
Here the moony n.opoke, dumb
Through the day forever keeps,
Telling night with punctual note
Of a blood-thirst in his throat.
Autumn comes with gold and red
Splashed upon the evergreen ;
Autumn grandly ceremented
Passes winterward, a queen.
Winter, with his muffled tread.
Leaves a trail but hardly seen;
All the seasons take their turn
Garnishing this leafy urn.
William’s house is good to scan.
For a soul looks from its eyes;
Though the architect was man,
Sure the architect was wise
In his estimate and plan.
It’s a shrine for William’s mate —
Living, yet inanimate.
William’s house is like the shrine
Where wise men and Mary met,
For within its Palestine
There’s the wife and Margaret.
Who wants more of the divine?
Who wants more at the day’s end
Than this trinity for friend?
MAORTLANP.
DARIUS.
Simons and Pauli.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
STMONS and Pauli worked together on
the east lode of the Ivanhoe. The
lode, which averaged 20ft. wide, was
very rich in pockets, but of only middling
grade in bulk. Still, with perseverance and
by keeping one eye on the shift-boss, they
managed to accumulate a very fair parcel
of specimens. Simons, a single man, living
in a camp, took charge of them, for Pauli,
having a wife with an aggressive conscience,
dared not take any to his home. lie had a fair
knowledge of assaying, and with the assist-
ance of a Dover stove, plenty of charcoal,
fluxes and crucibles, reduced the specimens
to marketable metal. After about a year of
such pilfering he made a sale which turned
in close on £550. He kept the five hundred
and gave Pauli the fifty.
The trick was a villainous one to play on
his mate; but Simons had a passion for a
woman, and for such cause men will betray
even their best friends. She lived in Ben-
digo. “Blue-eyed, with fair, gold-tinted hair,”
was Simons’s description. The daughter of
a prosperous grocer, her father, had laid
down the condition that, before claiming her
as his wife, Simons must show himself worth
at least five hundred pounds. As Simons
hadn’t got appreciably any nearer to fortune
by working on wages, his hand had closed
firmly on the five hundred acquired from the
specimens.
“Is this all it panned out?” Pauli asked
dubiously. He was a small, dark man, a
good little toiler, but at bottom had just a
touch of the coward.
“Yes,” replied Simons, a thick-set man,
short-legged, with a barrel of a chest and
arms like a gorilla. “How much did you
think it would pan out?”
“I thought it would be more than that.”
protested Pauli. “It appears to me, Jack,
you ain’t giving me a fair deal.”
Like nearly every crooked dealer, Simons
became unpleasant and resorted to bluff.
“That's what it panned out, Pauli. Take
it or leave it. If you're not satisfied you've
got your remedy. Go to the manager, or tell
the police; or." he added with a grin, “take
it out of my hide.”
“You know very well I can't do that. But
it doesn't alter the fact that I think you're
giving me a rotten deal.”
Then Simons flew into a rage. “You
blasted little hound ! Get out of my camp
or I'll kick you out!”
Pauli went; but, though Simons bluffed
with loud words and threatening fist. Pauli
knew that he had been robbed, and his
thoughts stopped not far short of murder.
Within a week Simons drew his time, sold
his camp, and with the congratulations of
friends sailed for the East to his promised
bride. Three weeks later an inquisitive de-
tective. nosing through the lists of gold-
sellers kept by the local banks, came across
the name “,T. Simons.” Being profession-
ally curious, he traced the bearer to the
Ivanhoe mine, where he interviewed the man-
agement. Simons had gone, but they concluded
that his twelve-months’ mate was probably
a partner in the robbery, and promptly sacked
him. The shift boss, who performed the
painful duty, being an old friend of Pauli's,
told him why; and so Pauli learned that in
addition to losing his job, he had been “done
in” for £2. r >o.
He found it hard to get another job. At
times he picked up an odd shift on one or
other of the big mines, but never secured
constant work. As soon as the time-
keeper collected his name he was sacked.
The stolen fifty pounds was soon
eaten up. Then bis savings started to
go. 11 is wife didn't make it any easier. She
knew well enough why he had lost his job,
and her continual reminders that “stolen
goods bring no profit” maddened him.
A couple of months later Simons, not yet
a married man, came back flash and swank-
ing. lie proposed to build a three-roomed
house for the bride who was to follow as
soon as their home was ready. Pauli, having
plenty of time on bis hands, watched the
progress of the'building. It was a nice house
—verandahs back and front, iron roof and
guttering, and a fine thousand-gallon tank.
When it was completed Simons went to live
in it—“waiting for the bride,” he explained.
He got work easily; by the simple expedient
of putting another “m” to his name—he
evaded the black-list. Pauli had thought of
this trick too late ; and his face was now as
well known as his name. He trudged day
after day around the dusty Golden Mile,
murder in his heart. True, he might have
sold up and sought another field, but ill-
fortune dogged him. His wife, worn with
w rry, fell sick; and other misfortunes befell
him.
One day Pauli stood outside the Lake View
battery-door watching a gang of laborers
erecting the new mill. Close at hand was a
stack of packing-cases labelled “Cyanide of
potassium.” Oue stood open wdiere a mill-
hand had been shovelling the stuff into a bar-
row and wdieeling it to the solution-room.
Harmless-looking, but Pauli knew the cases
held enough potential death to depopulate
a city. Nobody paid any attention to him
as he fingered the stuff, half-tempted to tak n
a lick and end his troubles. But he couldn’t
die and leave the old woman with a couple
of children. Then, as the stuff held and
fascinated him. a diabolical thought evolved.
Taking from his pocket an empty tobacco-
tin he filled it. That night he strolled past
Simons’s new house, and, pausing a
moment, threw the tin with its contents on
the iron roof. It rattled a little, then slid
gently down into the gutter. There it would
iie until, perhaps months later, rain came and
washed the poison into the thousand-gallon
tank. Thus, without risk to himself, he
would even-up the score with Mr. Jack
Simons.
Thinking it over in bed that night he
realised that if Simons were poisoned it
would cause inquiry, and he must be careful
to conceal any appearance of enmity between
them in the meantime. Keeping this in
mind he was apparently quite friendly with
Simons when they met in the street a few
days later. Hitherto he had avoided him,
as the mere sight of the man quickened his
blood and gave him a choking sensation in
the throat; but now, when he had him almost
in the grip of death, and revenge was on the
point of accomplishment, he assumed the
utmost geniality. Over a pot of beer they
discussed their old workmates of the Tvan-
boe and the misfortunes which had befallen
Pauli.
Simons was not, at heart, a really bad sort
of fellow r . and now that lie had practically
won his “golden girl” lie felt genuine regret,
at having double-crossed his old mate.
“I think I can help you, Pauli,” he said.
“I’m leader of a party sinking the West
Boulder shaft. We’ve got a swine with us
that’s always on the drunk. Loses shifts
after every pay-day, so that some of us have
to wmrk doublers. I’ll get the mob to pass
him out next pay-day and you’ll come right
in.”
Simons w r as true to his word ; the drunk
was passed out. and again Pauli became his
mate, this time in the West Boulder shaft,
sinking past the 500 ft., with the nearest
wmrking plat at No. 3, some 200 ft. above
their heads.
Simons found a strange restraint in Pauli.
The latter, in truth, w’earied of the ever-
lasting panegyrics on “the golden girl.” who
was not to come up till the long summer
was over and the rain had freshened up the
land. Pauli thought grimly of his own old
woman, stretched, unto the end seemingly,
on a bed of sickness; of her querulousness;
of the slovenliness and inefficiency of the
only help he could afford.
» * * •
They were firing out the shaft —twelve
holes with a couple of packets of dynamite
in each. All was ready. The enginedriver,
in obedience to the warning signal of five
knocks, had drawn the big iron kibble up
to the timber, then lowered it to the bottom
again. Simons had taken his stand on the
edge of the kibble, knocker-line in hand,
while Pauli hopped round, quick and lively,
lighting with a candle the little pieces of
gelignite inserted in the split fuses to give
them a good start. 't'he fuses hissed and
spat for a moment, then began to burn stead-
ily, pouring out volumes of smoke.

Why Kidney Disease Is so Serious?
“Every Picture
Tells a Story
The reason kidney disease is so serious is that it
comes on unnoticed, and often gains a firm hold of
the sufferer before he knows what is wrong with him.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills should be used
immediately there is any sign of Backache, Dizzy Spells,
Aching Pains in the Loins, Water Troubles, Gravel,
Rheumatic Pains, Sleeplessness, Irritability, Watery
Swellings in the Ankles or beneath the Eyes, Stiffness of
the Joints and Lumbago.
Doan’s Pills thoroughly cleanse the kidneys and
bladder, and assist them in their great work of filtering
the blood. But be careful to get the genuine Doan’s Pills.
TWO COMPLETE CURES.
Mrs. S. T. Burrows, 19 Springside Street, Bozelle, Sydney,
says:— “ln common with many others I have nothing but good
to say for Doan’s Backache Kidney Bills. Some few years ago
I was suffering a lot with my kidneys, and in consequence was
troubled with pains across the small of my back and dizzy
feelings, besides having no energy for anything. One day my
attention was called to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and in
the hope that they might benefit me I got a bottle. After taking
them for a few days my health began to improve, and by the
time I had used six bottles I was completely cured. I am
grateful to Doan’s Pills for the good they have done me, and
hope many will profit by my experience and use this splendid
remedy. I never suffer with backache now, in fact, feel splendid
in every way.”
Six years later Mrs. Burrows says:—“l have had no reason
to alter my good opinion of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They
cured me some years ago, and I am still well.”
TESTIMONY
FROM
SYDNEY.
Mr. W. .T. Frappell, who lias been in the employ of Messrs.
Wright, Heaton and Co., Sydney, for nearly thirty years, says:
“It gives me pleasure to testify to the curative value of Doan s
Backache Kidney Pills. I had been suffering with an aching
back for a number of years, and at times it was very severe.
After trying many remedies without getting any ease whatever,
I was advised to take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I did so,
and from the first few doses got relief, and after using three
bottles I was entirely free of backache. lam thoroughly cured,
and hope this statement will meet the eye of other sufferers and
be the means of them getting relief through the use of Doan s
Backache Kidney Pills.”
Twenty-two years later Mr. Frappell says:—“l am still
a great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured
me many years ago, and I find by taking this 'remedy now and
then that I am able to keep free from the torture of backache.

‘•Right,” said Pauli, as he climbed on to his
side of the kibble. ,
Simons pulled tiie knocker line, ana
then let go. Immediately the braceman on
the plat, two hundred feet above, started to
draw up the line, to prevent it be ing shot to
pieces.
"Right!” said Simons. One tense moment
and, with a slight jerk, the kibble started.
I'aull, with the carelessness of a man who
had done the thing a hundred times before,
was fiddling about, lighting his pipe with
the candle, His fingers slipped on the greasy
rope; he grabbed wildly, but the ascending
kibble overbalanced, throwing him back'
wards. He crashed down, his head striking
the jagged rock. Then he lay motionless
among the smoking fuses.
Like a flash Simons, acted. The knocker
line was out of reach; it was useless to
shout to the braceman above, for the rattle
of the ascending kibble would drown liis
voice. Leaping to the bottom of the shaft
lie seized the unconscious man by the waist-
belt with his left hand, then straightened up
and just mauaged to grasp the last ring of
the tail chain as it whipped upwards. I he
jerk of starting nearly dislocated Ins slioul-
der; but, setting liis teeth, lie* compelled Ins
thick hard fingers to retain their grip.
Very steadily the engine-driver lifted them
to where the timbering began, then com-
menced to wind a little faster. He was a
careful man, and, as there was no hurry
once the men were well up from the bottom,
he let her rock along gently.
Two hundred feet! To Simons the dis-
tance seemed endless. How lie kept his
fingers locked on that iron ring is incon-
ceivable. The tail chain, five feet long,
which was fastened to the bottom of the
kibble to facilitate tipping, did not hang
steadily, but swayed and swung like a pen-
dulum, often bringing Pauli’s head into con-
tact with the timber. At any moment he could
have relieved himself simply by loosing liis
grip on Pauli, letting him drop. Who could
have blamed him or called him coward^
Two hundred feet! Even when the kibble
reached the plat and stopped the agony was
not ended. The engine-driver, as usual
when landing men, brought the top rim of
the kibble level with the sill of the plat. The
braceman stared stupidly at the empty
bucket, until a voice, still eight feet down
the shaft, yelled up to him, “Hoist up! O
God ! Hoist up !”
In those last moments, while the puzzled
engine-driver slowly hoisted the necessary
distance, Simons almost let Pauli go; and
the flustered braceman nearly fell headlong
as he drew them in.
Simons, swung into safety, sat with
numbed arms while the man rang the acci-
dent signal.
Slowly consciousness returned to Pauli —-
at first as though it were a tiny speck float-
ing up from an abyss of unfathomable dark-
ness ; then he became aware of fierce pains-
in his head, of semi-darkness, witli queer
shapes he afterwards discovered to be the
cot beds of sufferers like himself, and at
the end of what seemed a long alleyway a
small light shining. He was in bed some-
where —safe. His last waking thoughts had
been full of terror —the slip, the futile clutch,
the bucket leaping upward. i lashing
thoughts of his wife and children mingled
with the sensation of falling and the horror
of coming death. Then came the smash as
his head struck the rock —and after that
darkness.
So. after all, he had not been killed, but,
somehow, had been saved, and was safe in the
hospital.
"How did I get here?” he whispered.
The nurse repeated the usual formula,
“You’re iu the hospital.”
“Yes, yes! But how did I get out of the
shaft?”
“Your mate saved you—held you with one
hand and clung to the bucket with the
other. Now be quiet and try to sleep.
Sleep! With his head throbbing like an
engine ! Sleep ! His fevered brain seized on
the whole episode, turning it over and over
in every aspect. So Simons had saved him.
As a miner he could picture every phase
of the rescue. Supposing the bucket had
been too quick and Jack hadn’t been able
to catch it: then both of them would have
been left in the bottom of the shaft to be
blown to bits, as had happened to many a
poor devil before. But the strength ot
the man —to hold him with one hand while
he clung to the bucket with the other!
Suddenly, as if with the twang of a tightly-
strung harpstring, sound struck him. llis
hearing clarified; the meaning of obscure
noises he had imagined were inside his head
became clear. It was raining ! Good God .
Raining! And the cyanide still on Simons’s
roof.
A murderer! When his children, climbed
upon his knee and questioned him, how
would he answer them? Could he look into
their young eyes, knowing that he had given
death to the man who had handed back to
them their father’s life? He loved these
children intensely, passionately. The thought
made him shudder. “O Christ, save him!”
he moaned. “Save him!”
“What’s the matter?” tho nurse asked
gently.
“The rain, the rain! Listen how it pours.
“Yes, thank God, it has come!” she
said fervently. “It was so wanted and will
do so much good.”
“How long has it been raining?” he asked.
“Oh, for hours. Now be quiet. Is there
anything you want?”
“My clothes. I must get up. I must go
and warn him. Where are my clothes?”
“Be quiet,” she commanded. “Your
clothes are not here. You must not get
up.”
“But I must! His life hangs on it. This
rain will bring him death.”
He tried to rise, but his head refused to
leave the pillow. “Send someone,” he
gasped. “Send someone to warn him. My
mate, Jack Simons. For God’s sake send
someone. Tell him not to drink the water
out of his tank —not to drink”
“Yes, yes! In the morning we will send.
But be quiet now, or you will wake the other
patients,” she replied soothingly.
“The morning will be too late! Someone
must go now,” he protested. But she shook
her head at the impossibility of it and went
away. , . , .
Half delirious, he pictured Simons drinking
the poisoned water. One mouthful would
be enough ; then swift death. No chance
for help! In a minute he would collapse;
in five minutes he would be dead.
Again and again the nurse came to him,
endeavoring to pacify, and promising to send
a messenger in the morning. “Too late, too
late! Oh. the cursed rain—how it pours .
Presently the charge nurse came through
on her night round. She stood with the
attendant nurse and listened to his ravings.
“I will take the responsibility,” she said, after
a short consultation ; and presently the nurse
returned with a soothing drink. He gulped
it down gratefully. It was warm and spicy,
and in five minutes he had forgotten his
troubles in a morphia sleep.
When he awoke it was broad daylight.
The rain had passed, the sun shone through
the windows.
The owner of a gruff voice noticed him.
“‘You’re awake, mate, I see. You a
lot of noise through the _ night, but yon ve
had a darned good sleep since.”
“What’s the time?”
“Well past ten o’clock,” replied the other.
“Ten o’clock,” Pauli gasped, stricken with
the shock. “Nurse! Nurse!” lie screamed,
and struggled to rise.
“Don’t get excited,” warned the gruff voice.
“You can’t get up, ’cos they’ve got you roped
down.” , , ,
They had. A stout twill sheet laced to the
bedstead held him bound lightly but firmly.
But his head was clearer now; he must
make them listen—force them to. Someone
must go to Simons’s —must go; even yet it
might be possible to save him.
“Nurse!” lie shouted again.
But when one came she was a stranger.
She knew nothing of any message to be sent.
But the charge-book had warned her of the
patient’s delirium, so she soothed him with
soft words, as if speaking to a child.
In utter despair he lapsed into silence. It
was too late, anyway. Simons was probably
dead by now. The affair was out of his
hands —he had laid the plot, and already God
had delivered the punishment. Dumb with
guilt and remorse he lay staring at the ceil-
ing.
A couple of hours later the nurse came to
his bedside. “Someone to see you, Pauli. If
you promise to be quiet I’ll let him come in.”
“Yes, yes,” he .promised eagerly, scenting
a messenger at last.
He watched the nurse pass down the ward
into the corridor. Who could it be? None
of his family—his wife was sick, and the
children were too young to come alone.
The nurse reappeared, shepherding a man
—Jack Simons!
“Well, how are you, old man?” he said as
he approached.
But Pauli didn’t hear the question. “Jack,
he cried, “don’t drink any water out of your
tank.”
Simons looked at the nurse and smiled; he
had been warned of Pauli’s delirium.
“Make you-rself easy, old chap. I’m not
likely to for a while. The rain came on
when I was in bed. and I expected to wake
up this morning with the tank half full. But
it wasn’t even full to the tap. When I
climbed up I found a round tobacco-tin had
got into the downpipe and plugged it up.
Some fool must have left it on the roof when
they built the house. I got no good from the
rain at all, and I needed the water be-
cause” —
He stopped short, for Pauli had slipped
into a swoon.
VILLY SEE.
The Pipe.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I SHALL dance to your piping never-
more,
So trim your tune for another’s feet.
My slioon are worn from your dancing-floor,
And I know where the moon falls ivory
sweet
And where the blossoming boughs swing low
It is barred with ebon and indigo.
I shall dance to your piping nevermore,
Though its strains may linger in memory;
I leave the hall and the lighted door
For the sound of winds in a budding tree
And the march of stars in the moon-washed
skies
That are too lofty to dream of lies.
I may go down to the silken surf
And follow the rune of the wandering sea;
I can lay me down on the springing turf,
Since the dance you piped for has wearied
me,
Or I may slip to some jungled place
Where the hunting moon cannot find my face.
Only the light of the toadstool lamp,
Burning blue in the scrub by chance,
Only the green moss, bossed and damp,
Where tired feet are not asked to dance,
Or the tree-frog thrumming in vine-thick
calms
To a sudden wind in a clash of palms.
I may seek the crest of a wooded hill,
With a valley fair as a sapphire cup;
I may wait when the eve is pale and still
And see how the fog comes rolling up;
I may follow the call of the sea or shore,
But I dance to your piping nevermore.
Mayhap, when you play, you will watch the
feet
In satin slippers go whirling by,
And find for a moment Life incomplete,
For no dancer steps with such zest as I.
For if Love mocked in your careless tune .
’Twas a heart that danced in my flickering
shoon!
You may lean to a window looking out
To the pirouette of a quivering reed,
You may see the waves in their silver rout
And a brown boat moored like a tethered
steed,
That in the flood-tide will plunge and prance;
But you will not pipe me again to dance.
I shall be high on an unknown hill
Or where sands are blue-lit and waters
hiss;
I shall not heed though the aria trill
From a lonely sigh to a calling kiss.
Though your pipe entice as in nights of yore,
I shall not return. I can dance no more.
