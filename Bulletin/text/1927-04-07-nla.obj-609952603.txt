Can Carlyle Come Back?
Will Carlyle ever again be widely read?
It Avould be strange, but there have been
many strange recoveries of popularity. In
our reversion to the Victorian writers, men
of letters begin to speak respectfuly even
of Longfellow. Carlyle is but a vague
memory of youthful inspiration and later
disappointment to the elderly, a word of
dubious association to the young. In those
who read him a long time ago his name
stirs a dim disquietude; those urged to
read him now murmur that he is out of
date. Yet at some points he is actually
nearer to the mind of to-day than to the
mind of the age in which he wrote, nearer
to the twentieth-century than to the nine-
teenth. In origin and in idea he belongs to
the awakened world of labor. Again he
extqls the hero, and the strong man has
to-day his opportunity in more than one
country, tired and confused by the partial
failure of democracies to work out their
own salvation and to remodel society.
Lord Morley thought that Carlyle’s
work had no promise of permanence, for
the reasons that it lacked the classic form
and was out of the main stream of
European thought and feeling. Yet the
Liberal ideas of half a century ago, which
Lord Morley himself represented, are
to-day less in touch with European
thought than Carlyle’s were. His style is
deterrent; those who come to the reading
of Carlyle for the first time may well
think it a wonder of artificiality and affec-
tation. But it is abundantly clear that a
generation which sits at the feet of Fried-
rich von Hiigel will not refuse the message
of a thinker because its expression presents
difficulties. A greater difficulty than his
style is Carlyle’s preoccupation with the
events of his day, the illustrations of his
theme, the symptoms of the social disease
of his time. Hudson, the railway king,
Peterloo, Governor Eyre, Morrison’s pills
and Miller’s mousetraps are, to the younger
reader, names and no more; he does not
Avant to be always looking them up. To
Carlyle they were tremendously important
texts, to be much labored with pompous
beatings of the pulpit-cushion.
It is probable that many will turn again
to Carlyle to find him offering a part at
least of the medicine for a sick world. He
denounced fiercely the world into Avhich he
was born, the ills in it which were of man’s
making; but he had for the world an invin-
cible hope. He was unmoved by the cold
science of, his day, with its Confidence that
the secrets of the physical universe were
finally disclosed. To Carlyle Nature was
preternatural—“this world after all our
science and sciences is still a miracle.”
Modern science has given back to the world
the sense of wonder of which Mid-Victorian
science strove to deprive it.
Seeing God as Truth, he was fierce
against all untruth, all conventional false-
hood and pretentiousness, injustice and in-
sincerity. As Richard Holt Hutton pointed
out, he was therefore more disposed to
sympathise with the great organs of des-
tructive than with those of constructive
force. He sympathised with Cromwell and
Frederick, with Mirabeau, Danton and
Goethe, because they destroyed what ho
deemed to be false. Yet he always strove
to sympathise with constructive work, to
bring men to see that only in justice and
strength and courage can a stable society
be organised to rebuild and refashion the
world more after the mind of its Creator.
He was an optimist, for he believed that
out of social chaos order would come at
last. It was the keynote of his philosophy
that in the long run good, and good only,
must prevail. Out of the bitter war peace
would gradually come. The wrong cause
might triumph for the moment, even for
a long time; injustice might express itself
in fact and law, but the elements of false-
ness and injustice in any evil system would
sooner or later destroy it from within. To
Carlyle the world was built on Truth and
Reason. He did not despair of progress
towards good, though progress was not uni-
form and continuous, and it seemed to
him that his own time was a period in
which progress was stayed. He saw, too,
that the cause of the check was the en-
franchisement of an uneducated populace.
It was a maxim of his hero, Frederick the
Great, that an educated people is easily
governed; the Australian Robert Lowe
(Lord Sherbrooke) cried, “Educate your
masters.” To Carlyle such an appeal must
have seemed a belated admission of crim-
inal neglect.
His achievement was not to have formu-
lated a philosophy, but to haA r e insisted on
a few fundamental ideas, parts of essential
truth, which in his age, as in many ages,
were but dimly remembered and ~ barely
operative, Philosophies may be super-
seded. Truth remains. Therefore it is
probable that Carlyle will be read again,
after that period of neglect through which
every writer passes.
He will be read, too, by those who are less
concerned with ideas than with their ex-
pression. His style was proper to himself
and his message, a thing unique in English,
almost studiously uncouth. Yet here and
there are passages of a rare charm: the
soliloquy of the philosopher in his attic,
the passing of a king to a scaffold, the pic-
tures of those whom he honored—the
Craftsman and the Thinker—passages of
translation from Richter and Novalis, arid,
scattered through every work, penetrating
and memorable phrases. No sensible
writer would dream of taking Carlyle for
his model, but no student of literature can
afford to neglect his crabbed and forceful
pages.
A. H. G.
Gallipoli To-day
“Few, indeed, of this generation will ever
see the beautiful but unobtrusive monu-
ments erected [at Gallipoli] to the memory
of 48,000 British soldiers and sailors. The
sacred plots have not been planned for the
curious gaze of man. That they lie in
silent, untrodden valleys and on the hills
where few men pass by makes them all the
more an act of faith and sacrament.”
Thus in Gallipoli To-day (London,
Ernest Benn) writes T. J. Pemberton, who
has been engaged in the erection of that
silent and solitary mausoleum which com-
memorates the superhuman effort in the
face of insuperable difficulties—a monu-
ment raised, as Sir lan Hamilton says, “not
to victory but to valor.” After a decade
“one may speak of the dead and the land
wherein they rest without the certainty of
reviving again the bitterness of despair, the
poignant grief, in the hearts of those who
suffered loss.” Yet, the author points out,
few of the living have a truthful impres-
sion of the sacred spot where some son of
England, Australia or Maoriland, once mov-
ing in the full pride of manhood, is buried.
For such parents this stirring book is writ-
ten. These cemeteries are not like any
other: they are bound to be different from
cemeteries where private people express
their own tastes in the headstones over the
graves of their friends. Here individual
taste has been eliminated except for a brief
text or quotation at the bottom of head-
stones. All men of whatever rank are com-
memorated alike. There is no unoccupied
space.
For the monuments of the dead a long-
unused quarry was found. No stone seemed
to have been taken from there for 50 years,
and there was no record of its first use.
The stone, however, was of the same class
as that of which the Homeric walls of Troy
were built. It has stood for centuries; it
will stand for many more. The recumbent
headstones and their foundations are of
concrete.
In no other part of the world is there
such a beautiful wilderness as on Gallipoli
hills iu spring. Spring comes early, and
with it a splendid array of wild flowers....
The asphodel, the cornflower, the wild thyme
and lavender, the yellow mustard-flower, mar-
guerite daisies and convolvulus, anemones,
rock roses, honeysuckle and a score of other
small flowers are overshadowed by the golden
glory of the broom. Then come the poppies
to paint the hills with scarlet.... 111 the
autumn the heather clothes the hillsides in
a hundred places with a glorious robe of
pink.
After the evacuation the battlefields re-
mained practically undisturbed for four
years. No burial could be accorded to vast
numbers; and there are comparatively' few
headstones over actual known graves. Our
dead on Gallipoli are, in thousands, “Un-
known Warriors.” There has been in many
cases no identification. The cemeteries are
on sloping ground, with the high side and
the two sloping sides enclosed by the belt
of trees. It was hoped to acclimatise many
Australian and Maoriland plants, but the
winters were too severe. As a background
to every cemetery there is a dark grove
of pine-trees (pinus maritimum) which
have a life of 500 years. Inside the ceme-
tery plots the chief shrubs in use are Japan-
ese laurel and rosemary, with blue and
white irises, the chief horticultural feature
of each plot being a row of cypress-trees
which will break the line of the back screen
wall and frame the central cross. The grass
is couch. Those who have been privileged
to gaze upon the scene exclaim “How
beautiful!”
“It is a steep climb up to the first
plateau, where a .massive pylon marks the
spot more sacred to the people of Aus-
tralia. It was at Lone Pine that the gal-
lant Australian men made their greatest
sacrifices. It was at Lone Pine that Aus-
tralians \von seven Victoria Crosses.” A
sapling pine has been planted on the spot
occupied by that famous tree. So, in the
end, the picture that will remain to those
who will never see that sacred plot of soil
is that of the luxuriant profusion of wild
flowers. “The pale yellow of the wild mus-
tard dominates the landscape To the
Maoriland eye most pleasant is the yellow
broom. Nature, having apparently lavished
all her richest colors on this vast canvas,
has not even then been content. She
has added to the picture the scarlet poppy.
Surely with, this little flower Nature has
done her utmost to clothe the earth with
things that are bright and beautiful.” And
for Maorilanders there is the picture at
Chanuk Bair of one manuka-tree, three feet
high, reared from seed in England, the only
manuka that has survived the Gallipoli
winter.
The book gains much value by the photo-
graphs showing every cemetery in the area
as it is to-day.

DAVID JONES’
The Six Best Modern Plays
While Arnold Bennett has been crying
down the quantity and quality of the work
of present-day English novel-writers, an
eminent theatrical critic has been making
high claims for .the British drama of the
hour. It is compared with the French
drama of the same period, much to the
detriment of the latter. In reply, St. John
Ervine, striking his chest, cries: “Where
are the French plays of to-day that will
compare with the English of the young
dramatists? The modern French drama is,”
he adds, “a lifeless thing, dull, mechanical,
boring.”
The challenge came from Mr. John
Palmer, the old-time critic of the Saturday
Review, who invited a list of six of the new
plays by English writers that will compare
with his own list, given therewith, of six
modern French plays. “Modern,” for the
purposes of the argument, is defined as
being “written within the last 10 years by
an author under 50, and reflecting tenden-
cies strictly contemporary.” His list of
French plays was:—
“Le Printemps des Autres,” Bernard.
“La Dent Rouge,” Lenormand.
“Le Paquebot Tenacite,” Vildrac.
“Le Tombeau sous l’Arc de Triompbe,”
Raynal.
“Tetes-de-Rechanges,” Pellerin.
“Jean de Maufranc,” Romaine.
St. John the Evangelist to the British
drama, thus challenged, got him to his list.
It was a brave response, especially as Shaw
and Galsworthy were out of the running,
though each has written “modern” plays
during the past 10 years. Ervine’s Irish
blood being up, his little lot ran to 14, end-
ing with the triumphant assertion that he
could have made it even longer had he
cared to (America is included, it is to be
noticed): —
“The Hairy Ape,” Eugene O’Neill.
“The Circle” and “Our Betters,” Somerset
Maugham.
“What Price Glory?” Anderson and
Stallings.
“Broadway,” Gunning and Abbott.
“Granite,” Clemence Dane.
“The Widowing of Mrs. Ilolroyd,” D. PI.
Lawrence.
“The White Headed Boy,” Lennox Robin-
son.
“The Man With a Load of Mischief,”
Ashley Dukes.
“This Woman Business,” Ben Levy.
“The Vortex.” Noel Coward.
“The Show Off,” George Kelly.
“At Mrs. Beam’s” and “The Rumor,”
C. Iv. Munro.
“Juno and the Paycock,” Sean O’Casey.
Modesty, or the age-limit, forbade the com-
piler to put into his list his own “Jane
Clegg,” a play worthy to be there.
Making lists does not lead to much,
especially when the contrast is one between
the art of two nations. The canons are
apt to vary. Even among people of one
nation no two lists are alike. I have seen
or read most of the plays mentioned by
Ervine, and some of them would not appear
in any list of mine. The sprightly contro-
versy between the two critics led, however,
to much compiling of lists among folk with
a taste that way. More than one merry
evening full of vehement controversy have
I spent at the business. A friendly bout
came of the matter put thus: “The best six
plays you have seen in London during the
last two years.” I found my own list had
it this way:—
“The Cherry Orchard,” Tcliekov.
“Uncle Vannya,” Tcliekov.
“The Three Sisters,” Tcliekov.
“Juno and the Paycock,” O’Casey.
“Outward Bound,” Sutton Vane.
“Granite,!’ Clemence Dane.
The last three got in probably because of
Tchekov’s plays I have seen only those
named.

Pestalozzi and Australian Education
This year marks the centenary of the
death of John Henry Pestalozzi, the once
obscure son of a Swiss doctor, now revered
by educationists the world over as the
father of modern education. After failing
as a pastor, a lawyer and a farmer, Pesta-
lozzi found his life work in teaching. His
first effort in that way was to transform his
farm into a home and training school for
foundlings, but it was not a success. He
tried again during the war period at the
close of the eighteenth century by father-
ing in a deserted convent some 80 orphans
from four to ten years old, the remnants
of the French attack on Stanz in 1798.
Within a year the French converted the
convent into a military hospital, but friends,
attracted by his efforts, rallied round,
and he was appointed head of a foundling
school. Here he was most successful in put-
ting his theories, now commonplace, into
practice, which together with his writings
gradually gained him a European reputa-
tion. But in a few years dissensions
caused him to transfer his school to
another canton, and finally to give up
teaching altogether. He died on February
17, 1827. Even after a century of edu-
cational progress we have not reached the
limit of his ideals. In our infant schools
his theories of self-activity and self-expres-
sion, together with hand and eye training,
reign supreme; but in the higher grades
we still have too much of the rule of
the big boss with a big strap.
Have Australian teachers, working under
btate administration, the same chances
to stimulate and initiate educational re-
forms that Pestalozzi had, faced with all
his difficulties?
We have no typical Australian school.
Officialdom points with pride to our rural
schools, but they work undler curricula
similar to those of town and city schools,
and do not combine, as they should, mental
tasks with manual activities, except to a
very limited extent. Our State education
systems, taken as a whole, are just copies
of British, Irish, German and American
ideas and methods, and even the best of
them are copied in a spasmodic and half-
hearted manner.
There is no Australian teacher noted
throughout the continent for any new and
improved methods of education. Bureau-
cratic control stifles such ambitions. Our
young teachers leave their respective train-
ing colleges eager to put the new idealistic
methods they have learned into instant
practice. One tries the Dalton plan,
another the project method, some other
classes his children according to intelli-
gence and psychological tests; and a Dis-
trict Inspector, long parted from the
enthusiasm of youth, comes along and
damns all such experiments with faint
praise, or none at all. And the young
enthusiast, to please his D.I. and secure
merited promotion, starts cramming his
young charges to pass qualifying, merit and
scholarship examinations. Any fine theories
of his own invention never receive practi-
cal exposition or official recognition.
All modern educational reforms seem
to come from schools and teachers who
are not under State control, but are either
self-controlled or else governed by local
bodies more amenable to the influence of a
reformer. For this reason, apparently,
Britain and America now lead the world
in educational experiments and reforms. The
Dalton plan that has proved so successful
in America and England finds few adher-
ents in Australia. One public-school in
Melbourne has adopted it, but no State,
high or elementary school uses it or its
modifications. An odd teacher here and
there tried the system, but received such
half-hearted encouragement that a leading
school-book publisher told me it would
not pay to publish text-books necessary for
its proper conduct and continuance.
Centralisation of educational control has
many good points, and teachers would be
loth to change the present State systems.
But any teacher who is willing and able to
’ experiment should be given every oppor-
tunity. This does not mean that he (or
she—it was a lady teacher who invented
the Dalton plan) should be sent to head-
quarters to work out his theories at a
teachers’ training college or similar institu-
tion. His own school, whether it be in
town or country, should be the scene of his
labors, for it is in his own school that the
heart of a zealous and true teacher lies.

The Apotheosis of the Cross-word
The man who produces a paper may
take every precaution to make the result
of his efforts the masterpiece of the cen-
turies ; he may gather his news re-
gardless of expense; he may have a
leader calculated to make Lang stop bor-
rowing and Bruce cease wearing spats; he
may be almost as proud of the principal
poem as the author—the pride of an
author it is impossible to surpass. In short,
he may be satisfied that his paper is
scintillating, and then some reader will dis-
cover that one of the unconsidered adver-
tisements is the cleverest thing in it.
This thought is inspired by the first num- .
bers of the London Weekly, a journal
issued to boost the cause of Empire unity.
In these numbers there are articles that are
portentously important; but to me the
greatest interest lies in the “Cross-word
Serial,” towards the end.
We all thought that the cross-word was
dead. Every paper that barks with the
pack ran competitions; all the big adver-
tising firms ran contests on cross-word
lines with bedroom suites and other super-
fluities as prizes; David McKee Wright
wrote a story showing how the boundaries
of an ancient empire were altered through a
conqueror’s conquest by the craze; numer-
ous light versifiers and literary humorists
wrote verses and jokes about it; and then
it suddenly died. The cross-word serial is
its ghost.
But the ghost is better than any of the
manifestations of the living craze) ever
were. There is a story attached instead of
a mere searching of dictionaries; and an
otherwise dull and unconvincing narrative
may be made interesting by this sort of
thing:—
The 2 across was 15 down above the
village of 7 down when a tall 31 down man
made his 35 down 42 across the 17 down.
It seems to lend excitement to the narra-
tive, too. You take a 4 down man who by
hard 29 across has been imprisoned in the
42 across; and all sorts of acrosses and
downs can happen to him. See how in-
triguingly the London Weekly’s serial
reads:—
There is not an 23 down of evidence
against him. It is a lie: that he came to
Tibet to 33 across into secrets, or to flirt
with the 5 dowm of a local chief —to force
him to seek a decree 19 across! Her 12
down is too noble.
“43 down!” she cried, when the executioner
14 down came to 45 across him to the stake.
“34 across!” said the Grand 5 across,
hushing her. “37 down an almost painless
operation.”
But 12 down, smiling bravely, put his
arm round her 36 across, pressed her 46
across, and gave her a passionate 22 across.
Then, in his most defiant 16 across, he
spoke to the 7 down around him:
“When a son of 30 down 5 down, he 5
down only once! May the 10 across dis-
solve in the 13 across; may your 28 across,
Grand 5 across, be turned into 45 across-
eushioKs; and may every child in Tibet be
made an 26 down, if you kill this Australian
16 down as well as myself! 31 down —
31 down,” he added brokenly to the girl,
then staggered with surprise.
“32 down !” It was the 5 across's order
to the executioner. “You are Australian?”
he jerked to the girl.
“44 across. From 19 down!” came her
answer proudly.
Spoken like that, the girl’s words are
unanswerable, compelling—all the things a
true heroine’s words ought to be. Really
(according to the cross-word) what she says
is “Yes. From New South Wales.” But
“44 across. From 19 down” sounds much
more impressive. Both the girl and her 5
down are able to make their 39 across. Yet
one feels that any number of downs and
acrosses are still likely to crop up in their
paths. It will be some 11 down before the
14 across is made 15 down and the 9
across takes 32 across. Or, in the poor
tongue that Shakspeare spoke, until the
way is made clear and the wedding takes
place.
In this cross-word serial a great Imperial
purpose is served. Even as the girl proudly
says that she comes from 19 down
(N.S.W.), so we learn that the hero comes
from S.A. (which may be South Australia
or South Africa); and Canada, India and
other fragments of the far-flung Empire
may be found amongst the acrosses and
downs. Anybody living in England, say,
will naturally look up “Vic.” when it
occurs in the cross-words to learn of dried
fruits, wool, police strikes and other native
industries. In this simple way is the cause
of Imperial unity helped on its dusty but
glorious way.
Harold Mercer.
A Satchel of Books
The Strange Adventure of Richard Con-
way Bowen, by C. R. Benstead (Hurst and
Blackett). “A comedy and a protest”—the
words of a whimsical dedication translate
its purport. A book of humor with mor-
dant touches.
The Carson Loan Mystery, by Aidan de
Brune (N.S.W. Bookstall Co.). The mys-
terious death of Ruth Carson, whose body
was found on the sandhills at Little Bay
(N.S.W.), sets in motion the machinery of
a well-constructed detective yarn that will
prop up the eyes of the “commercial” on his
Sunday-night trip back to the country.
Letters to America, by Bernard Gilbert
(Basil Blackwell). These letters are not
biographical, but may be regarded as sup-
plementary to the “Life” of the writer en-
trusted to G. K. Chesterton. The freedom
of the correspondence style gives a vividness
to the descriptions of character and scenery
and a wholeheartedness to the criticism con-
tained in the volume. Here is a characteris-
tic extract: “One thing is clear; whatever
England has in store, she has asked for.
We’ve done our national best to break tilings
up. We have been the asylum of all the
anarchists and terrorists and arch-rebels of
the world. Whenever in the world there has
been a rising up against authority we have
backed it heartily. Poland, Finland, Greece,
the Balkans, all had our support and good-
will.”
The Purple Shadow, by Edmund Snell
(Fisher Unwin). A fantastic tale with a
picturesque Malay background. It turns
upon a legend which told how a woman
stolen from a local village by a giant ape
became the mother of two children, one an
ape that threw the shadow of a man and
the other a creature resembling a man who
threw the shadow of an ape. The ape came
to his death but the man-beast found refuge
in a tree. The current belief among the
villagers was that once the tree was felled
the spirit of the long-before-dead refugee
would be set free to prey upon the world,
his first victims being those who had felled
the tree of refuge. Ilow Kennard of Tawau
laughed at the legend and put axe to the tree
and all that followed is the theme of an
exciting story.
Lawrence, Prince of Mecca, by David
Itoseler (Angus and Robertson). The pic-
turesque personality of Col. T. E. Lawrence,
“the uncrowned King of Arabia,” lias already
been presented to readers in a volume which
has been widely read. This new story will
appeal not only to those who have read the
larger volume, as supplementary to it, but
also to those who come fresh to the narra-
tion of the marvellous achievements of the
British officer. The story of this “infidel,”
clad in the flowing white robes of a Prince
of Mecca, leading and inspiring the leaders
of Mohammedan Arabia in the work of pin-
ning down or annihilating the Turkish posts,
field forces and garrisons at the time when
the Sinai campaign was launched, and sub-
sequently leading triumphantly to the city,
of Damascus an Arabian army numbering
many thousands, is full of color and move-
ment.
Solemn Boy, by Hector Bolitho (Chatto
and Windus). The young Maorilander lias
not written the Great Australian Novel which
we are all supposed to be awaiting open-
mouthed or tongue-tied or something. What he
did write is a quiet and simple story, almost
aggressively autobiographical. Australian
penmen who knew Bolitho before he left the
Sydney Evening News for London will re-
cognise at once the elements he has imported
into “Solemn Boy” from his own youth. As
a piece of writing it has one quality which
almost outweighs its glaring deficiencies as
a novel: it is written so simply and sincerely,
it is so free from the faintest endeavor to
be “clever” or “naughty” or “witty,” that
it impresses one favorably. Moreover, it is
evidence that its author commands a clear,
unaffected and attractive manner in prose.
Bolitho has had the good sense to be himself
and leave it at that, when he might so easily
have tried to be the clever young Australian
Prometheus attempting to ignite the Thames
with Roman candles. Apart from the style,
however, little enough can be commended in
“Solemn Boy.” The story (insofar as there
is a story at all) is inept, unreal and uncon-
vincing.

Two Sonnets of Futility.
I.
Beaten and broken in the toil for bread,
A man looked starward from the shadowed
lane,
Where, seen across the dusty window
pane,
Infinite night about him seemed to spread
A visioned splendor that the happy dead,
After long trial of the dust, might gain
And, counting earth and all its treasures
vain,
Live passion-purged, miraculously fed.
All round him laughed the spring in tender
green ;
Love went abroad with joy, on shining
feet;
And life was heedless as a morning sea.
Yet every hour had made his living lean ;
And, fearing death, he dreamt of life
complete
In sleepless, pulseless immortality.
11.
A pining angel, weary of his wings,
Looked from the balcony of amethyst
To where, all set about with silver mist,
Our planet in the heavenly concert sings.
Softly he sighed for tender dappled springs
And yellow summers and the warm lips
kist
By quiet death that comes before men wist
And sets the lowliest in the bed of kings.
All round him, white with life’s immortal
flame,
The brothers of his holy order went,
Treading wool-quiet steps in gentle zest
Of the great sweetness of a soundless
Name. .. .
Far downward through the breathless void
he bent
Knowing the dust, yet knowing not its
rest.

To an Old Pen.
This is our hour, old friend,
When every slcepv-head
In the house is long a-bed
And the clock ticks off swift minutes with-
out end!
Below, the great swamp teems
With myriad life; calls blent
The while a bass accompaniment
Throbs through the vast cantata; starlight
gleams.
But here, within the glow
Of th’ lamplight, you and I
Contented, high and dry,
Scribble on happily of things we know
And sometimes journeys take
In realms but little known,
Dream pastures all our own
Where is no longing that we may not slake.
Arcli-comforter alway,
What orgies we have shared,
What ventures we have dared,
And ne’er a meddling soul to say us nay!

“Did you never hear tell of that general
All on the plains of Mexico?”
Around the windlass, trampin’ slow,
We’ll sing a song of long ago.
Hurrah the plains of Mexico!
And hurrah for Santa Anna!
Did you ever hear tell of Grant and Lee,
Of Sherman marching his men to the sea:
Of Sheridan’s boys and of Hancock’s too,
And the old brigades in their coats of blue?
Hurrah for Santa Anna!
Did you never hear tell of good old Abe,
Strong as a lion but soft as a babe —
Did you never hear tell of Lincoln grand?
Ah, lie was the glory of Yankee-land!
Did you never hear tell?
You never heard tell of the Merrimac?
The little black Monitor broke her back.
You never heard tell how they set us free
From Canada’s line to Florida Sea?
Hurrah for Santa Anna!
You surely heard tell of the great Paul
Jones,
The dandiest fighter—Lord rest his bones !
He fought with the Serapis good and well—-
Of that John Paul Jones did you never hear
tell?
Did you never hear tell?
Hurrah for Santa Anna!

Round and round together,
Round the capstan head they go
Who sang of Santa Anna,
And the plains of Mexico.
Round and round a-singing
Of the brave men dead and pale,
Their tuneful chanty ringing.
And their tall ship breaking sail.
Round away for Sunset.
With her white sails dropping low,
The tall ship fades for ever.
But in echoes faintly flow
The songs of Santo Anna
And the plains of Mexico.

Struggle.
The body lay on the bed
Caught in a web of pain;
“Let me pass now,” the pale soul said;
“Set me free again!”
She beat her delicate wings
Like a bird in a net.
“O woe for the lovely things
I must needs forget!
“Not even when you were strong
Did you bind me so.
You do me hideous wrong—
Let me go ! Let me go!”
The body muttered and stirred
Through an age-long night,
But heeding never a word
Held its prisoner tight;
Till before the dawning was grey
Rose a little wind soft and chill;
Then pain and the soul fled away,
And the body lay still.

The Singer.
I would not weave my heart’s small histories
Into my song, lest haply one should say
“This liappy woman loved on such a day,
On such a day she wept,” and it should please
Some idle spirit to trace out my years,
Building wliat might have been from that
which seems;
My song shall only hold my gallant dreams,
My vagrant fancies, my forgotten tears.
The singing thought through long years
ripening,
Yesterday’s blossom to to-morrow’s fruit,
May hold my soul, too, where its deep heart
is,
From whence one may some sweet, some
bitter, bring;
But none thence takes my being by the
root,
Saying “This thing she is, nor more than
this!”

Heaven and Hell.
Moon-white in the garden wistaria falls,
Rose censers are swinging beside the dark
walls.
Afar in the shadows a lonely bird calls.
The primrose of afterglow pales in the skies,
By wind-ruffled reaches the whispering dies,
And my stars are only the grey of your eyes.
The creek’s frosted silver, now blurred by the
breeze,
The fairy lands leading away through the
trees,
Are sweet with moon-madness on nights such
as these.
This only is heaven, a heaven for two,
Forgetting the old things, forgetting the new.
In the mist and the moonshine, the shadows
—and you.
• • • • • •
This only is hell, in the white of the moon:
Wistaria trailing and shadows a-swoon,
The lonely bird’s call and the lazy creek -
rune.
While memory is writing, in letters of flame,
The records of sorrow, the reading of shame,
In the mist and the moonlight, repeating your
name.
The bitter cup’s draining is down to the lees,
And glamor’s gold portals, out under tue
trees, .
Are Hell’s twisted gateways on nights such
as these.

The Old Men.
Ours be the old lost places,
Grey ruins memory-haunted,
Seeking with careworn faces
And hearts that the years have daunted.
Lured by an echo of music
Where oft-times youth was fain;
For we are the old, the old men,
And none shall love us again.
Musing alone you find us
Quiet as we watch Life’s river,
Losing the years behind us
In the stream that runs forever;
Musing in fragrant gardens
Where love’s young; tale was told
Ere we knew that Time’s tread mouu
onward,
Or lovers must soon grow old.
Now the day of youth is olden
And the wonderful wheel is westing.
The hearts where love lay golden
Stilled in calm earth are resting;
Dark eyes that warmed to pleading
Where laughter chased the tears.
Who seeks must seek them vainly
In the lonely after-years.
A lilting bird calls low now
With love-notes richly throbbing,
Rut the dreams we dreamed must go 1
Like pale ghosts sobbing.
Not for us is the star-shine, _
Nor the moonlight’s silver stain;
For we arc the old, the old men,
And none shall love us again.

great reserve power
WHEN your way is obstru&ed when climbing a hill in
the Studebaker, lift your foot from the accelerator—
replace it when the road is clear, and drive serenely
on your way —without changing gears, without vibration no
knocks, no missing of cylinders, no strain on the engine.
This is one of the occasions when you realise and appreciate
the tremendous reserve power, the quick pick-up, the absolutely
vibrationless performance of the Studebaker. Excess power
liquid smooth ! There when you want it—arrow-swift! No
wonder Studebakers shoot to the top of steep hills without a
change of gears !
Studebaker alone in its price-class has a crankshaft and all
reciprocating parts fully machined and dynamically balanced
so that vibration is eliminated.
This practice of eliminating vibration by machining all recip-
rocating parts to accurate inherent balance is otherwise found
only in cars costing vastly more than the Studebaker.

THURSDAY, APRIL 7, 1927.
PARTY CONFUSION IN VICTORIA.
Party leaders and newspapers complain that
the Vic. public refuses to get excited about
the general election to be held on Saturday.
But there is really nothing to get excited
about. Since November, 1924, the State has
been governed after a fashion by a combina-
tion of Cockies and Nationalists, the former,
with 11 members in a House of 65, having
the Premiership and half the portfolios. The
alliance nominally ceased when Parliament
was dissolved, and in half a dozen cases
Nationalists and Cockies are out for the
same seats. But the Government has per-
suaded itself that things will so fall out that
its valuable services will be retained. In
that faith it remains in office and has issued
a declaration of policy. The Nationalists
have also come out with a policy, which
was unfolded by ex-Premier Lawson; and
H. W. Pickering, who is not a member of
Parliament, but hopes to become one, fol-
lowed suit on behalf of . the Cockies. An-
other policy speech was delivered by the
leader of the “Country Progressive party,”
which had one representative in the last
Parliament; and a fifth by the leader of
the “Australian Liberal party,” which had
none. Then, of course, there was the Labor
policy speech, Labor being the Opposition.
* * * *
Seven members have been returned un-
opposed, and 166 candidates have nomi-
nated for 58 seats. There were 48 Laborites,
44 Nationalists, 25 Cockies, 22 Liberals, 20
Independents, 11 Country Progs., 2 Ind.
Nats, and 1 Prog. Nat. In Upper Yarra
the electors have to choose from a Lab., a
Nat., a Lib., and three Inds. In Gippsland
West the combatants are a Lab., a Nat., a
Lib., an Ind., a C.P. and a C.P.P. The elec-
tion will be held under last year’s Electoral
Districts Act, which provided that metro-
politan constituencies should have approxi-
mately 22,000 electors, urban constituencies
15,000 and country constituencies 10,000,
and that Melbourne should thus get 26
seats instead of 21. Labor-leader Hogan is
making this measure the main count in his
indictment against the Government, de-
scribing it as “a political swindle devised to
cheat the electors, to handicap the Labor
party and to pack Parliament with reaction-
aries.” The Westralian Labor party, to
which Hogan belonged a few years ago, has
just consummated an electoral swindle
which gives 134 Labor voters a member in
Menzies and 422 a member in Hannans,
while 4549 Nationalist electors are denied
a representative in Canning and 4031 have
no representative in Leederville; but Hogan
is silent on that subject. His party says it
stands for the division of the 20 Federal
electorates into three State electorates, each
returning a member. The Nationalists reply
that- under such a scheme there would be
electorates with 13,000 people and others
with 22,000, and maintain that the plan they
supported, which did away with anomalies
such as one electorate having 16 or 17 times
the population of another, was “the best
obtainable.” The Libs, demand equal elec-
torates; the C. Progs, attack the Govern-
ment for “depriving the country of five
seats”; and Premier Allan insists that
without his scheme or something like it the
country would be delivered over to Mel-
bourne, to be run by that exorbitant city in
its own interest. This electoral argument
will go on until Victoria is divided into two
States in which the city’s craving for one-
vote-one-value and the country’s craving for
relief from city domination can be satisfied.
In Victoria, as in Westralia, the most
pressing problem is finance. Before the war
Victoria ordered its financial affairs better
than anj?- of the other States, but it has
spent loan money so wildly on land settle-
ment and the like that the public debt has
shot up from £79,000.000 in 1918 to
£144,000,000 or thereabouts, and the annual
interest bill from £2,715,000 to £6,500,000,
and consolidated revenue shows a deficit
which has apparently become chronic. All
parties profess to be alarmed at the situa-
tion v/hich has arisen, but none suggests
a remedy, although the Allancocks talk
hopefully of a tax on bookmakers, which
the Labor party, being friendly to book-
makers, opposes. Moreover, each of the
Vic. parties, like those of the States which
have just had elections, is short of good
administrators or men likely to become
good administrators, nor can any of them
hope to come back with a majority of its
own. It is a case which calls emphatically
for an elective Ministry. Victoria would
be far better served bv such a body than
it is likely to be by a Ministry composed of
Nationalists, or of Nationalists and Cockies,
or of Nats., Cockies and Progs., or of
Laborites, or of Laborites and Progs.
Whether the Progs, get one seat more or less
or the Nats, one less or one more matters
precious little. The division of the State
into two and the adoption of a system of
elective Ministries matters a great deal.
OLD PAWNSHOPS AND NEW.
An early event of the Federal session was
the Loan Bill. It was a small bill, for
rather over two millions, to keep things
going for three months; but Parliament
hasn’t settled down yet after its long recess.
No lavish detail was supplied, that being
reserved for the big oration which will
accompany the Budget; but eight depart-
ments were represented in the transaction,
including Trade and Customs, which wants
£2150 to avoid paying some small item out
of the huge Customs revenue, and Health,
which is in need of £2600. Straightway
there arose a warm debate about the rela-
tive advantages of raising the wind in Lon-
don or New York, and as the Government
didn’t snuff it out with the announcement
that Australia would serve its purpose, the
debate was in order. Theodore, the Queens-
land ex-Premier, who was provided with a
safe seat in Sydney, said that the Common-
wealth had badly mismanaged its business
when it floated its 5 per cent, loan of over
£20,000,000, one-quarter in London and three-
quarters in New York. He recommended
that a Permanent Official Borrower should be
attached to the Australian Commissioner’s
office in the U.S., and that the astute Yankee
money firms should be induced to enter into
cut-throat competition for this country’s
lOU, which the astute firms may possibly
refuse to do.
* * * *
The only reasonable deduction from all
this is that the Commonwealth is in the
same leaky financial boat as the States, and
has no more idea than they have how to be
anywhere else. Its Ministry has grandiose
schemes for providing homes and supply-
ing the States with roads and “migrants”;
it has knocked the per capita allowance
endways, and its general attitude of high
vision and lofty outlook is impressive to
a degree. But the financial problem which
overshadows all others and includes all others
is how to make exports exceed imports on
a steady average by sufficient to pay the
country’s outside liabilities for interest and
sinking funds. The surplus can only consist
in very small part of gold, but anything
that can be sold for gold will do as well.
It matters not at all whether the result is
achieved by increasing exports or by reduc-
ing imports, save that the former method is
impossible unless prices and seasons can be
fixed, and highly improbable even then,
while the latter is only a question of put-
ting up enough factories and doing enough
good work. To ship the Federal surplus
to the creditor’s land is useless. It consists
of bits of paper on which is printed Aus-
tralia’s promise to pay itself in gold, and
the inevitable query at the other end would
be: “Where the devil is the gold?” To
ship the country’s additional lOU S or, in
other words, to float more loans and pay
interest with the proceeds, and thus add it
to the principal, is an iniquity, but it has
become the invariable way. It is a gigantic
problem to solve after so many years of riot,
but the Bruces and Pages, and even the
Theodores, might at least keep it before the
fuddled country that there is a problem,
and that it calls for solution. They might
add, even if it wasn’t true, that they are
endeavoring, in their poor, humble, one-
horse fashion, to find a way out, and add
that suggestions and tenders would be wel-
come.
* * * *
Instead of following this unorthodox and
disturbing line of thought, the Federal Trea-
surer finally took up the attitude that it
wasn’t necessary to come to any decision
about the relative merits of London and
New York as centres of financial dissipa-
tion. “Co-ordination,” he said, “was neces-
sary in the case of a country which was
developing so fast as Australia.” The mean-
ing which emerged from this utterance was
that Dr. Page believes in borrowing at both
places, and has no objection to borrowing at
both simultaneously provided the difficult
operation is well handed. He gave no details
concerning the rapid “development,” nor did
he say how long it is since any part of any
loan raised abroad came here to develop
anything.
THE BEAM.
A five-candlepower lamp will dimly light
all the objects in a room, while the ray
from an electric-torch of the same strength
will vividly illumine any particular object.
The high-powered long-wave wireless, which
Australia narrowly escaped having to pay
for soon after the war, agitates the ether,
more or less dimly, in all directions. The
short-wave beam, using less power, directs
that power straight for its objective and
arrives in much greater strength.
The lighthouse, so to speak, for Aus-
tralia’s beam is situated 50 miles along the
Melbourne to Ballarat road and six miles
off that neglected thoroughfare. Ballan is
a small cow-country township which doesn't
dissemble its pride at having been raised to
strategic and commercial importance by the
arrival of the beam. Not that it was igno-
rant of the uses of radio. The proprietor
of the local hotel listens to 3LO’s orchestra
playing classical music while he polishes the
glasses in his bar. Scientifically-minded
cockies whose holdings are adjacent are.
also deeply interested. They claim that the
station has benefited their crops, and one
even Pears evidence to its power in an
increased fat content in his milk. Electricity
has been used to stimulate plant growth
before, but whether the beam is strong
enough to excite a lucerne patch a mile
away to more strenuous endeavors remains
to be seen.
A small forest of steel masts, each 250 feet
in height, makes the big power-house be-
neath it look dwarfish. One set of masts
stands at right angles to the course to
England; the other waits the completion of
the station in Canada. A set of aerials
behind the transmitting set performs electri-
cally the same function as the mirrors of a
searchlight. It turns back that portion of
the wave that would otherwise be dissi-
pated uselessly in all directions and con-
centrates it forward. To leap the globe
the beam is projected upwards. It follows
darkness, darkness being most kindly to it.
The theory is that it proceeds in a succes-
sion of gigantic leaps, rebounding from the
Heaviside layer which forms the invisible
ceiling to our atmosphere. It is interesting
to note its course. During part of the day
it takes the long way round, across the
Pacific and over the Atlantic, a distance of
12,369 miles. On the short way round it
leaves Australia at Derby, leaps Mount
Everest, looks momentarily down on Mos-
cow. and arrives in Britain after a journey
of 9231 nautical miles.
The loneliest men for miles round Mel-
bourne will be the engineering staff, now
that the preliminary tests have been passed
and the place must settle down to trans-
mitting traffic. Their job will merely be to
keep the big installation going. All the
signalling will be done from Melbourne,
Ballan being only a relay station. The
office, on the second floor of the Amal-
gamated Wireless building in Queen-street,
is much the same as any other telegraph
office. Although the receiving and trans-
mitting points are 30 miles apart, the re-
ceiving aerials being at Rockbank, 20 miles
from Melbourne, the operators who work
them sit at the same table. The two sec-
tions are brought together on land lines into
Melbourne, so that it is possible to tap out
a message for England and receive the
answer in the same room within a few
seconds. There is not much tapping of
keys, however. The system has shown a
capacity, when everything is favorable, of
300 words a minute, and a row of clerks
operating telegraph typewriters are required
to maintain this speed.
Although it is being asked a lot of search-
ing questions before the Wireless Commis-
sion, Amalgamated Wireless is very pleased
with itself these days, and none is more
pleased than G. Apperley. As superinten-
dent of the Melbourne end, he has had
the job of controlling the tests of the beam
(now accepted as successful) during the
last few weeks. For the human element is
as important as the mechanical in tele-
graphy. A stream of bogus messages passed
between the Queen-street office and the
English station and the staff of 30, all of
whom had been to London for intensive
training, played in grim earnest at sending
and receiving them, for the same accuracy
and expedition had to be displayed as if
the traffic was the genuine article. Apper-
ley was a recruit to Amalgamated Wire-
less in 1913, and has seen the concern grow
from babyhood to its present surprising
bidk. The service of land and sea radio
telegraphy now employs 800 Australians, and
it is inclined to regard the beam as merely a
stepping-stone to bigger things. The sta-
tion at Ballan works on a wave-length of
25.72 metres, and its engineers are of the
opinion that a difference of only half a
metre will be sufficient to cut out all inter-
ference between the English wave and the
one shortly to be projected towards Canada.
If this estimate proves to be correct, there
seems to be no reason why Ballan should
not become a great distributing centre,
levelling its beams at all the principal com-
mercial centres of the globe.
C.Q.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Soviet and the Railways.
The Lang Government’s scheme for the
demoralisation of the N.S.W. railways is
simple, effective and capable of being com-
pressed into few words. The Chief Com-
missioner’s salary is to be reduced by £lOOO
per annum (to £4000), while the Assistant-
Commissioners are to get £2OOO, which is
£5OO less than the old figure. One of the
Assistant-Commissioners is to be elected
by the employees, each of whom will thus
have three controls over the system, or
three votes in its management—through his
elected member of Parliament, through his
elected Commissioner, and through his
union. Commissioners are to be bound bv
a five years’ engagement, but the Minister
isn’t to be bound, having the right to sack,
or “victimise,” each official at three months’
notice. In practice this regulation won’t
apply to the employees’ Commissioner, for
to give him his walking ticket would almost
certainly result in a strike, but it is likely
to apply very seriously to the other Com-
missioners if they fail to do what the em-
ployees’ man wants.
All cases are to be tried by two Com-
missioners. The employees’ representative
will always be one. If the pair of judges
fail to agree, through the people’s man
taking risks and refusing to see things in
the same light as the union’s man, the
matter is to go before the whole Com-
mission, and if it fails to agree, through
one half of it taking more risks, the Mini-
ster is to decide—in the way most calculated
to avert trouble. In fact, the Minister is to
decide all matters of disagreement—fin the
way most calculated to avert trouble. In
order to keep the people’s representatives
lowly and humble the area commissioners
are to be reduced both in number, so that
each area man will have to do more work
and in salary, because he won’t have sc
much spare time to spend salary in. The
system of giving bonuses for good work is
to be abolished, partly because the Lanc
Government prefers the bad or medium work-
man and partly because recognition of a good
worker might inflate him with sinful pride
Further concessions are to be made to the
strikers of 1917, though they are not as yet
to be placed definitely on a higher plane
than the non-strikers.
It is provided that the Minister may, at
any time, instruct .the Commissioners, id
his own inexpert way, to prepare a plan fo;
doing any dashed thing, large or small
disastrous, impossible or otherwise, and
having got a plan, or drawn one up himself
he may order the dashed thing to be done
immediately. And they are to lose then
last, opportunity to practise a little economy
in construction through the transfer of the
construction business to the Public Works
Department, which is to say the Govern-
ment. If it is the sort of Government M
S. Wales and most other States have known
lately, the job will be done where votes are
most needed, even if it has to be undone
immediately afterwards. The number o.
things that call so loudly for undoing-
tramways and railways in particular —that
the cry cannot be unheeded is already quite
extensive.

Goitre in Australia.
By far the most important subject discussed
at the Australasian Medical Congress he
recently at Dunedin was goitre. Apart alto-
gether from the disfiguring nature °f J -
swelling in the neck of an affected P e,so
this disease of the thyroid gland has a P'.
found effect not only on the bodily hea


of the individual but on his mentality.
Though it is extraordinarily common in
both Australia and Maoriland, its incidence
is practically confined to certain definite
areas. In M.L. there is a well-recognised
goitre belt. In N. S. Wales it is seen in the
coastal plains, especially in the Hunter River
Valley and in the valleys and on the slopes
of the tableland to the west. Similar areas
are found in Victoria and Tasmania.
The whole story of the causation of goitre
has not been told, but the papers read at
Congress showed beyond any doubt that
the main underlying cause is an iodine
deficiency. It has been shown that fqod
grown in goitre areas is deficient in iodine.
It has also been shown by work among
school children that if small doses of iodine
are given to a group of individuals, the inci-
dence of goitre is less. The remedy would
appear obvious: give every one plenty of
iodine and eliminate goitre. Unfortunately
this cannot be done. Many people have
thyroid glands which are easily stimulated
by iodine to become abnormally active. In
these persons a grave condition known as
toxic goitre develops. On account of this fact
great emphasis has been laid on the danger to
the community of the so-called goitre cures.
The iodine in these remedies is so concen-
trated that their indiscriminate use results
in an increase of the worst form of goitre,
toxic goitre. The amount of iodine which
can be safely used is that contained in one
part of iodide of potash when mixed with
250,000 parts of common salt. Professor
Hkkcus, of Dunedin, recommends the uni-
versal adoption of salt of this composition
for general domestic use.
The Congress had no power to pass reso-
lutions recommending legislative action. But
it has asked the Federal Committee of the
B.M.A. to endeavor to secure the passage
of legislation in M.L. in regard to the uni-
versal adoption of a standardised iodised
salt; and in view of the fact that goitre is
present in Australia as well as in M.L., it
is to be hoped that the advisability of
recommending iodised salt to Australians
will be considered. If iodised salt can pre-
vent goitre in one place, it should do so in
another under similar conditions.
♦
The Piecework Problem.
Some valid reasons for the adoption of
piecework in the engineering trade were
given before the Federal Arbitration Court
in Melbourne last week. Marshall Eadie,
director of the engineering firm of Mac-
Pherson’s, Ltd., told Judge Beeby that the
44-hour week in Australia would tremen-
dously advantage the firm’s overseas com-
petitors unless extra production made up for
the weekly loss of four hours. In spite of
the tariff protection of 45 per cent., brought
up to nearly 60 per cent, by freight, insur-
ance, etc., English manufacturers were land-
ing their products in Australia at a price
14 per cent, lower than the Australian maker
could sell at. Britain pays the highest wages
of any European manufacturing country.
Nevertheless wages costs in Australia
were 114 per cent, higher, and more in com-
parison with such dangerous competitors as
Germany. Material costs also were lower
in Britain—in many cases 50 per cent,
lower. Between them these two factors
made a hurdle that even a soaring tariff
would find it difficult to negotiate; and the
hurdle was raised still higher by inter-State
freights, usually as high as those paid by
oversea shippers and often higher. The on J y
chance for the industry, as far as the firm’s
principal lines were concerned, was the con-
sent of the unions to payment by results.
If that was given, the witness’s firm could
not only increase its output of articles made
in “quantity lots,” but enter on the manu-
facture of many others which it was now
compelled to import.
It is an uncompromising statement of a
plain case, and one which must have the
considered attention of the skilled worker
and of fathers who desire that their boys
shall be something more than white coolies.
Of course the union boss will have to be
reckoned with. To him piecework spells too
much prosperity for the toiler, and a pros-
perous toiler is apt to rebel against union
tyranny masquerading as discipline. Behind
the union boss stand the loafers and incap-
ables, usually the noisiest section, who are un-
willing or unable to earn high pay on results,
and hate to think of better men doing so.
But in Australia these are a poor minority;
and once the majority rouses itself the
union boss will either accept the situation or
be replaced by a more intelligent official.
♦
White Fetish-Worshippers.
No amount of argument or example seems
to be able to convert the Australian Labor
party from its shibboleths. The minority
report of the Federal committee which has
been inquiring into mail and passenger facili-
ties between Australia and the Papuan-New
Guinea-Solomon groups is an instance.
Signed by the three Labor members of the
committee, it varies little from the majority
report, save in urging that only firms
employing white crews under the Navigation
Act should be given contracts. Yet on their
tour through the islands they must have
heard irrefutable evidence of the tragedy to
Papuan and New Guinea trade which the
Navigation Act proved, a tragedy which the
Australian seamen’s strike nearly brought to
a culmination. In addition, the latest
Papuan report shows that trade and indus-
try revived from the moment the provisions
of the Act were suspended, and that the
first year’s total of exports and imports
under the new regime reached a figure never
hitherto approached.
A return to the conditions which nearly
starved Papua out during the seamen’s
strike is unthinkable, save to fetish-worship-
pers. They cannot have it both ways.
Australia’s dependency must be permitted
to pay its way, as it now promises to do,
or it will become a costly burden on the
Federal taxpayer.

Ships that Sink in the Night.
Seabrook, of Tasmania, poured a tale about
the coastal shipping industry into the
inattentive ear of the House of Representa-
tives on a recent day, and moved that all
sections of the Navigation Act bearing on
the coastal trade should be scrapped. The
proposition wasr talked out, which was a
pity, for a division, if taken in a full House,
would have been instructive.
The principal points in Seabkook’s narra-
tive were these: —
There were 33 first-class ships trading on
the Australian coast in 1920, the pre-Navi-
gation Act year, and of these only eight
remained. When it was added that all the
overseas craft had been put out of the busi-
ness of carrying freight and passengers from
port to port, the loss of facilities for sea-
trade and sea-travel was tremendous.
If the Navigation Act was living up to
the promise that it would create a great
local marine manned by an ever-growing
race of sturdy Australian sea-dogs. Sea-
brook submitted that proof was dashed
hard to find, while disproof was lying round
in quantities.
Also freights are high as well as scarce,
and as an example it was pointed out that
it costs less to send canned fruits from Tas-
mania to England than from Tasmania to
North Queensland.
The loudest and most ridiculous voice raised
in reply was that of Laborite Yates, of S.
Australia, who embarked on three discor-
dant propositions. One was that the reduc-
tion of the number of first-class ships on the
Australian coast from 33 in 1920, just before
the Navigation Act arrived, to eight when
it had been five years in force, was due to
the war, which ended in November, 1918.
The war thus only began to be deadly after
it was dead. Yates’s second point was that
the immense Customs revenue, arising from
duties on goods arriving in ships which are
shut out of the coastal trade, showed that
said coastal trade was all right and flourish-
ing in an astonishing way. The third point
was that Seabrook’s motion was in reality a
brutal attack on the Australian seafaring
class, whose emplovmcnt was most uncon-
genial if not utterly horrible —which left it
an open question why the Labor men who
drafted the Navigation Act didn’t mend the
conditions, ,0 d why they so badly wanted
to reserve the allegedly disgusting occupa-
tion for Australians.
The inter-State shipping advertisements
are now very different from those of other
days. Those apnearing on the last day of
March mentioned 10 vessels to leave Sydney
during April on the long sea trail which ends
at Fremantle. Three are “cargo only,” and
three go no further than Melbourne. Ten
vessels were booked for the north during the
month. Six were listed for “cargo only,” and
one for “Brisbane only.” which left three
survivors of the 1920 fleet of 33 first-class
ships to carry on the old passenger-freight
service to places beyond the Queensland
capital. It is a very scanty fleet for a sea-
girt continent.
The foreigner profits. When it is possible
to get goods from abroad instead of from
another State, there is visible advantage,
especially in places handy to where the
overseas vessels call, in getting them from
abroad. This is especially the case with
duty-free or low-tariff imports. Ocean
freights are low for the distance, while
coastal and railway charges, including break-
of-gauge expenses, are high, and keep rising.
In addition the coastal ship is often hung
up by “industrial troubles” for longer than
the time involved in a voyage from England.
The Navigation Act and the semi-paralysis
in the local carrying trade which followed
may help a little to explain why Australia’s
imports since the Act arrived have averaged
about £140,000,000 per annum, while they
never even touched the £100,000,000-mark
before that event. The struggle to pay for
these great masses of goods, in great measure
with borrowed money, has been terrific and
disastrous, and the extent to which they
have elbowed out local products has been a
calamity.
The Public and the Medical Profession.
Dear Bulletin, —“S.N.R.” in his reply to
“Lawyer” (B. 24/3/’27) says: “For any
alleged technical, non-criminal breach, a
solicitor or barrister is entitled to be judged
by his occupational peers Doctors and
clergymen are unfortunately exempt from
this refinement of justice.” This is news
indeed. Let me assure “S.N.R.” that, in the
eyes of the law, doctors, solicitors and all
other professional men are in exactly the
same position as regards civil actions for
negligence in the performance of their pro-
fessional duties.
In practice, however, doctors are found
to stand on a different footing from men
in all other professions. If a man goes to a
lawyer, puts the facts of a transaction before
him, and asks to be advised whether the
lawyer who was previously employed acted
negligently or not, the traditions of the pro-
fession ensure that he will get advice as
candid and reliable as if a brother prac-
titioner’s interests did not enter into the
question. On the other hand, owing to the
policy of intimidation pursued by that super
trade-union the 8.M.A., it is practically
imnossible to get a doctor to admit that a
previous doctor’s treatment has been negli-
gent or unskilful, much less to give evidence
of it in a court of law.
“S.N.R.” says: “When every unsuccessful
client may take action against a lawyer for
negligence and lack of skill in the handling
of a case, I fancy my professional cousin
will bestir himself to have formed a Legal
Defence Association for his own and his
brethren’s protection.” For centuries clients
have been able to bring actions of negligence
against solicitors, and many such actions
have been brought, and won. Yet I have
not heard of any move to form a Legal
Defence Association.
It is not open to dispute that every reput-
able lawyer regards his client’s interests as
paramount. Can the same be said for the
doctor with his patient? I make the definite
charge that some of the very leaders of the
medical profession put their duty to that
profession on a higher level than their duty
to the community.—Yours, etc., Another
Lawyer.

Our Northern Products.
In some industries we are getting along very
nicely, but we are still terribly afraid of
tackling the manufacture of our own
northern raw products. Trochus-shell, for
instance, is used in the making of pearl-
buttons and other popular trifles; but thus
far we send all the trochus we get to
Japan, where the factories are. That is
bad enough at the best, but should rela-
tions become strained at any time, out will
go the bottom of our trochus market.
Thursday Island, or Cairns, should be able
to run factories for the home use of the shell,
so that reliance would not have to be en-
tirely upon a foreign buyer. Sisal hemp,
for the manufacture of rope, grows well in
the North; but rope-making is still one of
the industries of the future. Yet it would
seem to be just the thing to turn our own
Australian colored and half-caste labor to
account. In a recent National Geo-
graphical Magazine (U.S.A.) an article
dealing with Jamaica and its resources re-
ported the successful manufacture of rope
with native labor; and there seems to be no
better reason why it should succeed there
than here. At present most of the island
population of Torres Strait is engaged in
pearl or trochus fishing, or beche-de-mering;
but these activities have a thin period
whenever the Asiatic situation becomes
troubled, and there are years, too, when
heavy weather prevents work for long
stretches at a time. Industries which could
be developed on shore would be a good
thing for home and village life, and we
owe it to these people to help them to
establish a few.

The Right of Exclusion.
The amiable British practice of allowing
cranks and crooks of all creeds and com-
plexions to enter British territories un-
checked, and there wax fat on preaching
and practising sedition against their hosts,
seems to verge sometimes on imbecility. A
few years ago Fiji was the scene of serious
rioting among the Hindu coolies. Several
lives were lost, and the trouble was only
squelched when the cause of it was kicked
out of Fiji. The same situation is arising
again. Another venomous agitator has
arrived from India to take the place of the
first one, and has already got the Hindu
population on the move with stories of
British misrule. A Hindu rising in Fiji
would be a very serious matter for the
whites, for, though the Fiji native in the
mass is no lover of the intruder, he would
be of very little use against Doan Singh in
such an emergency. The Government will, no
doubt, deport the new disturber. It would
have saved a lot of trouble had it kept him
out. British people have got into the habit
of regarding exclusion as something rather
to be ashamed of. Yet we have only admi-
ration for the housefather who is careful
enough of his children to exclude any visi-
tor likely to corrupt them. And the mother
who has never warned off any undesirable
neighbors’ kids is the sort that generally
commands pity.

The Empty North Gets Emptier.
The go-slows of Darwin are doing their
best to abolish what scrap of trade remains
to the place, and it isn’t much. The last
half-year’s exports, for an area of over
half-a-million square miles, were worth
£17,088 as compared with £240,850 in 1918,
when the Navigation Act wasn’t working.
The usual pace of a stevedoring gang load-
ing a ship at Darwin is 12 tons per hour,
which isn’t much, but a recent grouch re-
duced this to 3f tons. As a result the
vessel went on, leaving most of Darwin’s
exports behind. Hearing that the grouch
was growing worse it was decided that the
next boat should save time by leaving Dar-
win’s imports behind at Melbourne. The
North Australia Commission and the two
Residents (at Darwin and Alice Springs)
can do nothing, but the Bruce-Page Gov-
ernment might do a lot, save for its fatal
knack of attending to other people’s jobs
and neglecting its own. If it would leave
off house-supplying fads and State road-
making freaks, it might then concentrate
its paper surpluses (paper being quite good
enough for local works) on pushing for-
ward in real earnest with a standard-gauge
line across the continent, working wholly
from the south end where fairly sane labor
is available. When it had got its main line
and some northern branches constructed
free of debt, which is perfectly feasible with
all these surpluses, and begun to settle the
Empty North on the freehold principle, it
would have such a name as no Federal or
State Ministry ever earned before, and
echoes of it might blow through the trump
of fame all the world over. What, at
present blows is the news that there is a
wonderful country up there —tens of thou-
sands of square miles —with nobody watch-
ing it.

Forestry in Victoria.
Dear Bulletin,— Re “Wanchai’s” remarks
(B. 17/3/’27) on bush-fires in East Gipps-
land. One pound deposit is required from
every cutter as a guarantee that he will
observe the conditions of his license, of
which burning off tops is one. In the first
week in October (not November, as stated)
he is given written notice to burn up, and
the forester makes sure that he does so.
He has thus a month to burn off before
the fire season commences, and, “Wanchai”
notwithstanding, all tops are burnt off, as
failure means cancellation of license. Less
that one-half per cent, of deposits are for-
feited, and even those usually for some
other breach of license.
Bushmen certainly smile at firebreaks
Nevertheless, the first step in combating a
busli-fire is to select a suitable starting-point,
and clear a track three or four feet wide from
which to bum back to meet the main fire.
Isn’t it better to have that break cut in
readiness, in winter, than to have to spend
valuable time on it when the fire is raging?
A limited but splendid forest of Gippsland
grey-box at Cann River has been kept free
from fire in recent seasons chiefly by means
of such fire-breaks. How such breaks act as
“very effective flues” is difficult to imagine,
when 100 yards is about the longest straight
stretch. The full value of fireguards can
never be realised. The Commission’s staff
is proving every day that most fires can be
stopped by men properly organised. There
are, of course, exceptional days when it is an
impossibility to stop a fire, and those are
the fires which are reported in the news-
papers.
What the Commission is doing with the
men and money at its disposal is to clean
up and thin out good belts of timber, and
surround them with a wide firebreak, with
the object of absolutely excluding fire
from them. It is a bold policy, and will
take considerable time, but there is no
alternative if we wish to pursue a sound
forestry practice in Victoria.—Yours, etc.,
VoFSA.

A Grazier Faces the Tariff.
Until J. P. Abbott arose at a conference of
N.S.W. graziers it was generally assumed by
the folk who watch flocks that tariffs were
an invention of the Devil, who had devised,
such things specially for their discomfiture.
Abbott, who had been thinking about the
buyers of wool as well as about the sellers
of it, discovered that the weavers of Rou-
baix, so often a prop and pillar to the wool
market, not to mention the good folk of
Bradford, admit Australian wool freely, but
have to moderate their enthusiasm because
a goodly proportion of Australian trade
goes to the nation that is doing its best to
keep Australian products out of its markets.
He therefore suggested that it ought to be a
rule with the people who frame Australian
tariffs to distinguish with no small percent-
age between folk like the French, who buy
£15,000,000 worth a year more from us than
we buy from them, and those like Uncle
Samuel, who sells us each year nearly
£30,000,000 worth more than he lets us seil
him. The logic of the argument appealed
to the wool-growers, and Abbott’s views got
unanimous support. One hot convert was
in favor of telling Sam to keep his motor-
cars and shearing-machines so long as the
Fordney-McCumber tariff contains the piece
about a duty of 30 cents a pound on scoured
wool. The spirit evinced may be a bit raw,
but it is infinitely preferable to the sort
of tearful moan that has usually accom-
panied a reference to the tariff on such
occasions.

“A.G.M.” (Lond.): Wandering from fron-
tier to frontier in France, as it has lately
been my privilege, I was again impressed by
the very decided change in the French
character as revealed in the bearing of its
people. As far as outward indications go
the masses of the French are now more
reticent than the English; and in the matter
of emotional display and irresponsible gaiety
there is much more of it in the region of
Piccadilly than on the heights of Mont-
martre. There is, I believe, a pretty general
idea that the whole world has changed—
that since the war men and women have be-
come less serious and more determined to
seize the joys of the moment. It is quite
true that this has been and is the case in
England, but I know it is not true of either
France or Italy, and I believe that it is
utterlv untrue of Germany.

“The Listener-In”: A few facts relative to
“Murkah’s” definite prophecy that “no
more cables will be laid” (B. 17/3/’27).
Last year British and foreign cos. constructed
and laidj or they are about to lay, 16,000
miles of cable. The Pacific Cable Board
has started duplicating its All-Red route.
The Eastern Extension has just laid a
cable of a new type from Cocos to Perth—
it cost £600.000. Last year the Western
Cable Co., the British pioneer in S. America,
earned £68,726 additional revenue, in spite
of competition from several radio concerns.
The Italian Government already owns a
radio system to S. America. Last year it
laid a competing cable, or paid a thump-
ing subsidy to the private firm which laid
it. Why? Probably because it isn’t as easily
satisfied as “Murkah” that wireless is “an
unbreakable link.” Australia is part-owner
of a cable system and a radio system. It
isn’t likely to scrap one in favor of the other
until its Defence authorities are certain that
radio in time of war can be neither tapped
nor jambed.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Some sort of a non-Labor coalition will
have to carry on in Vic. after the general
election, as there is no chance of any one
party securing even a bare majority of seats
(33). Nationalists and Cockies will per-
haps aggregate 37 members, and Laborites,
Country Progs., New Libs, and Independ-
ents muster 28, all told. There is no great
eagerness for office outside the Labor ranks,
as there was a deficit of £315,000 last year
and there will be at least as much this
year. Besides, people are clamoring for money
for all sorts of things, hospitals, bridges
and schools particularly. And the House of
Landlords is determined that its friends, who
are already pretty heavily hit, shall be safe-
guarded in the matter of new taxation. A
crusade against the Uppah Chambah
wouldn’t catch on. Football is much more
attractive.
Greenough having retained its Labor mem-
ber, the position in Westralia is exactly as
it was at the corresponding stage of the 1924
State election. Labor has 25 seats and the
Opposition 21, and Collier’s party has only
to win one of the four northern electorates to
get a majority of two in the House. As it
held Kimberley and Pilbara in the last Par-
liament and just missed getting Gascoyne,
the feat ought to be fairly easy. All the
came, there will be no credit in a victory
associated with the disgraceful business of
the electoral boundaries and the packing of
constituencies with day laborers brazenly
unloaded on alleged “Federal-aid” roads.
There would be credit had the party been
honest in these matters and taken its stand
on its record for the last three years and on
its decided superiority in point of ability to
the inept Opposition, which is as weak as
the one in Queensland, if not weaker.
The S. Ans. Labor Ministry has nose-
dived and come down in flames as the
result of the general election, and its wild
extravagance in loan expenditure is men-
tioned as an outstanding cause. After all, it
wasn’t madder than its immediate predeces-
sor, but it chose a worse time to be mad.
The debt increased by about £l2 10s. per
head between 1922 and 1924 under Barwell,
and by £l3 10s. between 1924 and 1926
under the next men. All this high finance
raised S. Australia's interest rate to the
highest point among the States, even though
the Commonwealth put its name on the
back of the bill to the extent of nearly nine
millions.
While N. S. Wales has been talking about
family endowment, Maoriland has done the
deed. From April 1 any child under 15
belonging to a family that can’t scare up
more than 80s. a week is sure of a florin to
enable it, or its parents, to withstand the slings
and arrows of outrageous fortune. The Re-
form party, which stopped reforming shortly
after it got the chance, and which has now
15 years of wasted opportunities to look
back on, seized on child endowment because
it had to have something fresh to put in
the shop window.
If one might judge by the robust butchery
which took place when the Cantonese entered
Shanghai, the Chinese hate each other as
badly as they do the British, and they don’t
seem to hate the British much worse than
the “militant” section of British Labor does.
Both hates were to some extent imported
from Moscow.
A gift for unconscious humor distinguishes
Jock Garden from the dull lads of N.S.W.
Labor, Jock’s latest is a glowing eulogy of
the liberties enjoyed
by British subjects,
and a stern con-
demnation of the
Bruce-Pages for
violating those
liberties by denying
him the right to
have a soul-feast
with the Chinese
comrades who are
twisting the Lion’s
tail.
Edmund Jowett,
who is trying to get
back into politics a 3
a Vic. M.L.A., has
been relating some
experiences. At one
time lie rented tw-o
unprofitable cattle-
stations in Queens-
land. He tried to
sell his leases for
£2OO, but getting
no offer he ex-
plained to the State
Government that he
surrendered the pro-
perty and threw
two runs at its
head. The Federal
Taxation Depart-
ment saw Jowett
off the premises by
sending him a bill
for £3OOO, and said
the fine would be
£3OO a year till
paid. His other
stations, Jowett
said, were rated on
a riotous basis also,
so he met the Gov-
ernment’s valua-
tions by sending in
valuations of his
own, and sat tight.
When the bill
mounted to £87.000
it was brought be
fore th e High
Court, and the de-
partment lost the
case with costs.
What adventures he
had, if any, with
Theodore’s ren t-
raising court, the
candidate didn’t
say.
Kew (Vic.) may deliver a surprise verdict
on Saturday. Reynolds, the chosen Nation-
alist, who is a Digger and a lawyer, is
opposed by Clark, a local Lib., Kent Hughes,
an unpledged Nat., and Riley, a Laborite,
who has had more than one try for Parlia-
mentary salary. Kent Hughes is also a
Digger and a Rhodes scholar, and every time
Reynolds thinks of his rival’s vote-catching
smile and persuasive address he feels uneasy.
Rhodes’s young man will command a big share
of the second preferences-—probably the
majority of Reynolds’s and Clark’s, and most
certainly three-quarters of those voting for
Riley.
A kind-hearted Labor Government made
the ferry across the Brisbane River from
Kangaroo Point to the city a free show.
Other Brisbane ferries were added to the
list, the City Council being told to recoup
itself out of rates. Recent statistics show
that the Kangaroo Point ferry cost the
council nearly £2OOO more than the rates
collected from the “Point” last year, and
that the free ferries cost £35,000 altogether.
It seems a pretty stiff “shout,” even for
Queensland.
With an unexpected display of energy, the
Bruce-Page Ministry refused Garden and
two other Sydney Trades and Labor Coun-
cillors passports to go to Canton and associ-
ate with the anti-British Chinese and intru-
sive Russians there. Then events began to
move. A meeting of Chinese “Nationalists”
was held in Sydney with a Chinaman in the
chair, and to his assemblage Garden hinted
darkly at reprisals :
The Duke has not yet left Australia, and we will
have something to say in this matter. Previously
we laid all our cards on the table, told the
Government what we wanted and what we intended
to do. Now we will do our own business in our own
way, and will not tell anybody.
It certainly read like a threat of stoppage,
and there is no hope of bailing up the 26,500-
ton battleship Renown by job-controJ
methods. Fifty-nine years ago a loony per-
son tried to prevent the departure of another
royal duke by the crude process of firing a
gun at him. If anything of the sort should
be attempted again, people will ponder hard
over the report of the imported Garden’s
remarks to that meeting of Chinese.
The right of Governments to set aside
commercial contracts entered into in good
faith has been tested by some of the Maori-
land dairy companies whose produce was
seized by the Dairy Control Board. The
Appeal Court, consisting of the Supreme
Court Bench, has decided that one of the
companies which had arranged to sell stuff
GENERAL MUDDLE—DIRECTOR OF CEREMONIES.
“The arrangements for the Ducal tour in Victoria are being hedged
around with secrecy to the accompaniment of acrimonious noises from the
neglected country centres and the E. S.A.”
through a private firm had entered into a
contract which was valid and enforceable
and not against the public interest. The
case will now go to the Privy Council,
whose decision will have a lot of interest for
Governments keen on compulsory pools—
Lang’s, among othei-s.
Last year, after promising J. Bull he
would reduce expenditure by 10 millions,
Winston Churchill increased outgoings by
30 millions and wound up with a deficit of
14 millions in place of a promised surplus of
five millions. His excuse was that Baldwin
had wished a coal subsidy on to him. This
year there is. a deficit of 36J millions in
place of a budgeted surplus of four millions.
There was a coal strike, of course, but even
Conservative newspapers like the Morning
Post are beginning to demand Churchill’s
head on a charger.
Even the Yankee was driven at last
through the unspeakable brutalities perpe-
trated by Bolshevised Chinese “Nationalists”
on white women and others at Nanking to
open fire. He and his British colleague are
said to have disposed of 7000 Chinese before
a rescue of the white population was effected,
It w-as a Moscow newspaper which set the
figure, and announced that “ten million
organised Soviet proletarians” called down
all the curses of all the gods of the atheists
on those concerned, and trusted they would
burn in the hereafter which has been form-
ally abolished. About this time, and with
no Aime to spare, the final squadrons of
U.b. missionaries, or the survivors of them
arrived at the coast with coat-tails streaming
in the wind.
The Royal party had a really truly taste
of country life in N. S. Wales. The Duke
and Duchess spent the week-end with the
Macarthur Onslows, at Camden- and the
faithful S. M. Herald reports with a
tremor in its voice that special motor-cars
ran out of the big bloated city with the
oysters, fish and other tucker—even the
frozen cream.
The Maoriland Liberals did themselves no
good by changing their name to Nationalists
on the eve of last election. Forbes, the
Nationalist leader, has won no laurels, and
will probably resign in favor of either Ward
(who refused to take the new label) or
Veitcli. Veitcli stands a show- because the
dairy-control fiasco is the best stick to wallop
the Coates crowd with, and Veitcli, who has
some sort of a cow-cocky following, is able
to say “Told you so!”
The fine work being done by Vic.'s
Licenses Reduction Board is making it more
and more difficult for Cold Tea to get fol-
lowers. Twenty years ago there were 3507
pubs in the State, one to every 360 people,
there are now 1870, one to every 905. And
the reductions have, as a rule, been made in
neighborhoods where the drinking saloons
were superfluous in more senses than on*-.
Licensees have been warned that if they
aim at running mere swill-shops, they’d better
try some other line of business. As a result,
premises have been improved to the extent
of £1,357,000 in five years. If Barr, I,ock
and Tanner keep on this sort of control, local
option will get a freezing reception when
it comes into the open in 1930 after a
forced spell of eight years.
Sources of recent “industrial trouble” have
been, among others: (1) Because the em-
ployer sacked a man; (2) because lie
refused to sack a man; (3) because lie
refused to employ a man; (4) because the
union refused to let a man in and refused
to work with him because he was out; and
(5) because two unionists couldn’t agree,
and some sided with one while some backed
the other. In about out of 22 instances,
it has been explained that the union officials
and the bulk of the union itself were dead
against the disturbance, but that they were
helpless because a small and violent section
had got out of hand; this was especially so
in the case of the great Yallourn (Vic. I
strike. When a small and violent section
gets out of hand and refuses to strike or to
pay a levy, the various steps are fine, sus-
pension and expulsion. There is no weak-
ness then, but it is amazing how flabby
union authority becomes when it is a striker
and not a worker who defies it.
Victorian Laborites faced the electors with
a simple device for making the railways pay
-—by putting the land revenue among the
receipts. Flow that would be making the
railways pay no one took the trouble to
explain. Victoria’s land revenue, from sales
and rentals, is about £430,000 p.a., so a
very ordinary railway deficit would eat it
up even if it was net, which it isn’t. Ex-
penses of the Crown Lands Office were
£268,216 in 1923-24, and if the losses on the
land-settlement jag were thrown in the
department would be hundreds of thousands
annually to the bad. In 1923-24 Victoria
spent about six times as much as its gross
land revenue in buying back land with loan
money.
The Queensland Government’s ewe . lamb
or white elephant, according to the point of
view of those regarding it, is the Dawson
Valley irrigation scheme. It has been drag-
ging on under consecutive Labor Ministries
until its actual worth is difficult to arrive
at. Last week a member of the Common-
wealth Migration Commission and a Britisli
Migration Commissioner set out with a Par-
liamentary party from Brisbane to inspect
the scheme at first hand; a favorable report
will probably result in the Dawson being
passed as suitable for British settlement
under the £34,000,000 agreement. The area
should be tested for tobacco-growing possibili-
ties, the home market for tobacco being so
great, but it has been heavily handicapped
by political and industrial interference.
William Demaine, president of the Queens-
land Labor party’s central executive, rue-
fully admitted at Maryborough the other
day that a contractor had offered to buib*
a local hospital for £37,000, whereas the
Government Works Department, which goes
in for day labor, quoted £49,000, and wasn t
keen on the job even then. “The people to
whom I belong,” said Demaine sadly, “are
pledged to day-labor; I’m pledged to it; but
the difference was too great.” This admis-
sion that you can drown your principles u
they threaten to drown you, will, no
doubt, result in the election of a new presi
dent of the Q.C.E.

The play was very bad—
very bad indeed, but the audience had suffered
it more or less patiently. In the third act a
terrific struggle took place between the
forlorn heroine and the heavy villain. A
lamp was overturned and the stage plunged
into darkness. An unearthly scream, a
moment of tense, dramatic silence, then,
from the villain, a cry “Good Heavens!
What have I done? ” A thick voice floated
from the ‘Gods’: “Strike a light, guv’nor.

“Cliloe”: One of those plausible persons
who pervade ihe suburbs and offer harassed
housekeepers cheap goods or cheaper labor
pushed his face round the kitchen lintel the
other day just as I was drying my hands
after strenuous hours of gardening. “I
say, Missus,” was his artful opening, “that
there garden of yours is a beauty. I’ve just
finished a bit of asphalting up above, and
I’ve just enough stuff left to do them paths
of yours.” “How much will it cost?” I
asked. “Well.” pursued the tempter, “any-
one else would charge you two quid, Missus,
but as the garden is so nice and I have the
stuff right here, say a quid.” I struck the
bargain, and, after assuring me that it
would improve the look of the garden 100
per cent., the cheerful soul got going, and
in an hour and a half, had tarred and
sanded the two paths. They seemed a
bit treacly, but he guaranteed that they
would be firm as cement in 24 hours,
and took his pound with profuse thanks,
after showering some further compli-
ments on my roses. That night my neighbor
came in to inquire about a barrel of fai-
th at was missing from his shed !
**■ * *
“Privateer”: Turned up in Hobart the
other day, after four months in the Antarc-
tic, the Norwegian whaler N. T. Nielsen-
Alonso. She looked the part, with hardly
a speck of paint left and some bad bruises
from the ice along the waterline. She
reported having caught the largest whale on
record, a cow blue whale measuring 110ft.*
weighing 115 tons and yielding 100 barrels
of the finest oil. I don’t know what the
record was before, but I know that the
skeleton of a whale for many years looked
upon as an outsize is preserved in a whal-
ing museum in Norway. It is also a blue
whale, measures 96 feet, and was caught
on the Iceland coast ’way back in the ’nine-
ties. The Nielsen-Alonso expedition brought
back 36.500 barrels of oil, a very hand-
some catch, with which she has proceeded
to Europe via tlie Horn. The four small
whalers remain at Hobart for the winter.
The mother ship landed, besides the 27 Tas-
manians who signed on in Ilobart. 10 Nor-
wegians, who have had enough of whaling
and want to try their luck in Australia.

“Cartot” : The real reason for the saluting
of the quarter-deck on a warship (B.
31/3/’27) has nothing whatever to do with
either the Sovereign or the White Ensign.
In olden days it was the custom to suspend
a crucifix in the stern of the vessel; the modern
salute is a survival of the obeisance to this,
MARMADUKE GET S A LESSON.
MARMADUKE: “Now, as soon as you feel bored, tell me and Ell take yon home.”
HIS NEW WIRE : “Not for worlds! When I feel bored I’ll send you home.”
and not a tribute to human rank or autho-
rity. When tlie British Navy was re-
organised during the Tudor regime, tlie
crucifix was placed there, probably in imita-
tion of tlie same custom in Spanish war-
ships. My authority is Fortescue, the naval
historian, who states that it remained in
some vessels right up to the latter part of
the eighteenth century. The gaff from which
the White Ensign is now flown is in all
likelihood the post from which the holy
symbol was suspended. In the Government
archives in London there is still extant an
order made by Cromwell, the Minister of
Henry VIII., for placing of the crucifix in
Royal ships.
* * * *
“Naklioda”: The old lady who tore the
corset advts. out of magazines intended for
Diggers in a Melbourne hospital (B.
31/3/’27) was depriving them of a lot of
quiet and wholesome pleasure. When I
lived with six other exiles in quarters on a
woman-forsaken islet off the coast of Borneo,
the productions of the female haberdashery
people were our only aesthetic pabulum.
There was one epicure amongst us who never
grew thin and morbid because of the lost
delights of Sydney town. He mixed with
the other sex in fancy as he dreamed over
tlie bundles of society journals that came
his way, and he dined sumptuously on the
pages of Mrs. Beaton’s Cookery Book. At
night he used to make out a choice menu
from its pages, garb himself carefully in
evening dress, and then, after a long scrutiny
of the glorious colored representations of
the various dishes, sit down in a sort of
gustatory trance to the foul mess of buffalo
meat and quia malacca prepared by our own
slant-eyed poisoner.
“J.H.M.A.”: “Narara” (B. 17/3/’27) and
“Biliai” (B. 31/3/’27) are both a little
vague as to the connection of the Rum
Corps with Wiseman's Ferry and the Great
Northern Road. Tlie original Corps was
sent back to England by Macquarie in 1810,
and it was finally broken up in 1823, after
serving in Guernsey and Bermuda. The War
Office, however, not knowing what to do
with the disbanded units of the regiment,
called for volunteers from among them for
colonial service, and in 1826 a body of
troops consisting of three captains, three
lieutenants, 10 sergeants and 130 privates
landed in Sydney under the revived title
of “The New South Wales Corps”—some-
times alluded to as “The Veteran Corps.”
It was distributed amongst seven stations
in N.S.W., one in Norfolk Island, and two
in V.D.L., and its ultimate dissolution took
place on the Ist of April, 1833. As the road
between Sydney and the Hunter Valley was
in course of construction a little before that
date, it is likely enough that small detach-
nieiits of this body—directly descended from
the Rum Corps—did duty at the convict
stockades located in the neighborhood of
Wiseman’s Ferry; but the famous, or infam-
ous, corps could never have been there itself.
I am inclined to doubt “Bihai’s” statement
that hangings took place at Judgment Rock,
on the north side of the Hawkesbury, for
even in those rough times persons capitally
charged had to be taken before a criminal
court; no commandant or magistrate could
string them up off-hand along the roadside.
But it is an old story of “the System” that
dies hard in N.S.W. and Tassy.
“Lao-dah” : Two huge draught-horses hang-
ing by their necks was a spectacle provided
in a Melbourne street the other day. A cap-
sizing lorry swung them up in their own
collars, and there they hung, looking as fool-
ish as two carcases of frozen mutton, until
an onlooker with a knife released them.
* * * *
“Russ”: While listening on his broad-
cast receiver on Christmas Kve, a wireless
enthusiast of Camberwell (Vic.) was
astounded to hear faintly but clearly the
announcement “2LO, London, speaking.” He
quickly gathered three reliable witnesses and
with them hung to the programme until
II p.m. Knowing the shout of disbelief his
story would evoke, he swore his witnesses to
secrecy until he had armed himself with
the B.C.C.’s official confirmation, which he
received a few days ago. His receiver is the
reverse of an up-to-date instrument, too.
* * * *
“Flagwagger” : The operator who collects
the garbage of our neighborhood leaves few,
if any, articles of value to enrich the attend-
ants at the local destructor. On the front
of his dray he carries many bags, into which
he carefully stows all bottles, rags, cast-iron
and other things worth keeping which he
comes across on emptying the tins. He has
wonderful eyes and a nose that has grown
hardened to the divers smells connected with
bis calling. The “find” he lingers over most
lovingly was a demijohn of ale; some drunk
must have planted it and forgotten its hiding-
place. He boasts that the sale of “rubbish”
provided him with sufficient money to build
liis five-roomed cottage. Incidentally, the
two chimneys are constructed of bricks and
half-bricks which he picked up here and
there in the course of five years.

“Strict Veg.”: The other day the Nortli-
cote (Vic.) magistrates wrestled with the
knotty problem whether a father should be
fined twice over for omitting to have his
twins vaccinated. Finally they decided
that one penalty would suffice. The
precedent which turned the scale was that
the Federal Treasury pays the baby bonus
only once for double events !
THE CON MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Most of the chiefs of the Sydney confidence
y an gs are in prison during the visit of the Duke
111(1° Duchess of York on the elastic charges which
ire so useful to the police on these occasions. How-
ver, men thus incarcerated cannot be kept for an
indefinite period; most of them will be at liberty
it Easter, and much keener than usual.” —Annus.
0, Sydney is a dinkum place when crowds
are surging round
ind pigeons waiting to be plucked in every
street are found.
Vt taking toll of simple souls we’ve risen to
be stars,
Wherefore the Johns have got us cooped be-
hind the prison bars.
V week or two for vagrancy or trumped-up
“evil fame,”
;)n hollow pretexts such as these they block
us from our game.
A spell inside is hard enough for any common
crook,
But it’s toughest on the con. man
Who feels a soured and wan man,
A crushed and woebegone man who cannot
“dook the Hook.”
We never watched her swinging through the
Heads, the grey Renown,
Or helped to swell the myriad shouts that
rose from Sydney town.
0, what to us were stately arch and bunting
fluttering free,
And what the crowds that lined the streets
from Newtown to the Quay!
Our nimble hands have nought to do, our
specious tongues are dumb,
And from the cheering world without only
faint echoes come.
We’d swap our possies cheerfully with quite
the humblest bloke
On whom the March sun shone. Man,
Free agent, liither-and-yon man,
Commiserate the con. man who’s stowed
away in soak!
The gorgeous pageant rolled along with frill
and pomp and fuss;
No Duke unbent, no Duchess smiled her
radiant smile for us.
HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES.
“That new boy of Nora’s looks an awful pill!”
“Yes; but when it comes to chocolates he’s worth a guinea a box.”
A harvest rich was there to reap, with many
a country mug
Prom his fat wad detachable —and we inside
the jug!
The affluent uncle from Fiji, the racecourse
certs as good
As gold, for once they never got the merry
spin they should.
The royal voyagers came and went, in loyal
noise there vied
The Dom. man and the don man,
All classes save the con. man,
He was a dies non man this trip—worse
luck!- —inside.
And yet we love you, Sydney, as oft and oft
we’ve showed,
As dearly as the bards who put their feelings
in an ode.
They cannot hold a chap for weeks, at any
’tec’s caprice.
Because lie’s managed to conceal his crimes
from the police.
'Tis hard we couldn’t greet the Yorks and
draw our quid pro quo
At such a piping time, but still you’ll see us
at the Show.
They’ll surely turn us loose before the Easter
joy-bells chime.
The leary up-and-on men,
The always-boat-the-John men.
The slyly wily con. men who’ve done their bit
of time.
N.s.w.
T. THE R.


“Oxmead”: A Sydney evening paper has
instituted a discussion whether the Duke
of York shouldn’t have “and Canberra” added
to his title by the Imperial Parlian’ent, and
we are assured that the idea has caught on
in England. Which recalls that early in the
sixties of last century it was seriously pro-
posed that Queen Victoria’s second and third
sons, Prince Alfred and Prince Arthur, should
be respectively ennobled as “Duke of
Canada” and “Duke of Australia.” The
Queen, one of her biographers records, was
rather favorable to the proposal, but for
some reason it was dropped, and Edinburgh
and Connaught supplied the. young gentle-
men with . titles. The discarded idea may
have, had its genesis in the fertile brain of
Benjamin Disraeli, who subsequently induced
Parliament to add “Empress of India” to
the Queen’s entitlements; there is something
Disraelian about it.
Queerly enough, two days before the Sun
began its newest crusade The Bulletin re-
ceived a mysterious unsigned cable from
England :—-
Suggest Bulletin start movement rename Can-
berra York or Albert. District name might be
Bettyland or Anzac.
The suggestion didn’t set the office bubbling
Avith enthusiasm. What Canberra wants is
not a new name as a neAV climate.
“Uramao”: Many years ago in Maoriland
an artist arrived from Sydney and set uo
his easel in a small town, where there was
scant demand for landscape or portraits.
Tiring of inactivity, he obtained a iob naint-
mg houses, but his Bohemian
habits proved distasteful to
his employer and he was
soon at a loose end again.
The stormy nature of his
final interview Avith the boss
left a rankling sore in his
artistic breast, and he deter-
mined to get even. He sought
odd jobs painting signs on
hoardings for traders, and it
soon began to be noticed that
many of the figures be por-
trayed bore a ludicrous re-
semblance to the employer
Avho had sacked him. The
climax arrived Avhen he exe-
cuted a sign for a specific
for regaining one’s appetite.
The artist depicted his late
boss as a lean and hungry
individual before using the
tonic, and after using it as
a typical gourmand. There
vvere some hurried negotia-
tions, conducted by a third
party, and the painter left
the township a fevv days later
Avith a wad of notes in his
pocket.
“Neirbo”: “Strict Veg.”
needn’t worry about the pros-
pect of feminine baldness
(B. 24/3/’27) ; cutting or
shaving has little or no effect
on. the natural groAvth of the
hair. The main reasons for
lack of thatch are dryness
of the scalp, germs, tighten-
ing of the skin, and in rare
cases insufficiency of certain
minerals in the blood. Why
Avomen preserve their hair so
much better than men is
merely because they give it
much more attention. A man
Avill wash liis hair any old
time with any old soap, and
not apply oil to compensate
for the natural oil that he
is “killing”; a woman, on
the other hand, makes some-
thing of a solemn rite of the
process, but the result is gen-
erally worth while. “Strict
Veg.” may feel further com-
forted to knoAv that hair
roots never really die, and
anyone under 55 may with
proper knowledge and perse-
verance re-cultivate his fal-
low to the satisfaction of
himself and the confusion of
the flies.

“1.D.8.” : Referring to the
Grasfontein (S. Africa) dia-
mond rush (B. 24/3/’27), a
curious find is reported from
the field. This is a quad-
ruple “stone” composed of
four distinct diamonds joined
together without apparent
flaw, the total being de-
scribed as of the size of a
small marble. Apparently, the stones
are not of first-class water, for it
is stated that they will prove only really
valuable from a collector’s point of view.
Nevertheless, that should be considerable,
for high prices ‘have been paid for similar
freaks in the past, as was the case with the
famous Westralian “Southern Cross” bar-
oque pearl. The combination of four dia-
monds, too, is probably a record. Twin
stones have more than once been an object
of curiosity among the South African and
Hatton Garden dealers, and a triplet or
two have been heard of. This seems to be
the first recorded instance of four of a kind.
“H.lv.”: Some well-intentioned person
recently advocated in the N.S.W. Assembly
that appropriately-worded signboards be
erected in the vicinity of the Middle Harbor
Suspension Bridge as a deterrent against
suicide. I would suggest as an alternative
the distribution by the Government of
copies of a melancholy work written by
George Barrington, that one-time famous
London pickpocket whom Governor King
made chief-constable at Parramatta. Com-
piled at the beginning of last century
the book is dolefully entitled “Biographical
Annals of Suicide, or Horrors of Self Mur-
der, whether impelled by Love, Penury,
Depravity, Melancholy, Bigotry, Remorse or
Jealousy; calculated to deter even the most
Avretehed from this Horrible Crime, and
enable them to Bear with Fortitude the Ills
of This Life by a Comparative View of the
Miseries of some of. their Fellow Creatures.”
The author notes in a foreword that “the
Demon Suicide has spread its baneful con-
tagion as far as the inhospitable shores of
NeAV Holland.” Incidentally, the first offi-
cially-recorded suicide in Australia occurred
at Sydney in 1803, when a prisoner, con-
demned to death for theft, deprived the pub-
lic executioner of a job by hanging himself
in gaol.
* * * *
“Pakiwi” : Have some Maori tohungas the
gift of second sight? The story is still told
that when the New Zealand, Joe Ward’s
gift ship to the Empire, was taken the round
of the Shaky Islands, an old chief came
aboard at Auckland, looked mysterious, and
wrote his autograph on one of the struts
of the foremast. He then took an officer by
the hand, prophesied that the ship would
be in action inside tivo years, that it would
be hit in four places—he showed the places
—and that there would be no casualties,
lie produced a greenstone necklace and a
plaited apron of flax, which, he said, would
protect the ship if the captain wore it in
action. The skipper, as a matter of fact, did
wear the apron, at Jutland, though he baulked
at the necklace, and things happened as the
(dd chap predicted. It isn’t incredible to me.
Timi Kari, who had been initiated into all
the deepest secrets of the Maori priestcraft,
used to have fits of prescience like that at
rare intervals, and he Avas always right.
* * * *
“Momokeni”: Although diseases such as
pneumonia, influenza and consumption kill
Papuans off like flies, they can stand, like
the Australian abo., an amount of physi-
cal injury that Avould kill any Avliite man.
There had been a fracas in one of the Delta
dubus. and a number of the participants
THE BLIND MAN’S DOG.
“The Victorian general election will take place on Saturday. The general body of electors,, confused by the half-dozen parties that
have been seeking their favor, have shown little interest in it.”
came to me for treatment. One man had
been slashed with a scrub-knife from the
shoulder to the buttock, a ghastly wound which
laid bare his ribs. x\.fter enduring a matter
of 14 stitches, the patient stood up, craned
his head over his shoulder and said to the
bystanders, in tones of pride, “Look, boys,
see what the Doketa has done. Sewn me up
like a piece of cloth.”
* * * *
“Lao-dah”: The world’s most easily dis-
couraged husband was mentioned in a Mel-
bourne court the other day. Having secured
a strong and energetic wife, aged 19, and a
mother-in-law prepared to pay the rent and
supply the food, he went to bed. After a
fortnight of married bliss he left in high
dudgeon, his disappointing bride having ven-
tured to propose that he should get up and
look for work.
* * * *
“Tamornie”: The paragraph about the
display of crockery, stamped with the names
of various steamship lines on the table of a
N.S.W. hoarding-house (B. 31/3/’27) reminds
me. A visit at meal time to any of the
bungalows in Rabaul between 1913 and 1918
would have suggested that Burns-Philp was
catering for the crowd, and every clothes-
line in the place flaunted towels with that
company’s name stamped thereon.
* * * *
“Bihai”: Traces of a higher civilisation
in New Guinea are not confined to dubious
potsherds found on the coast. On the Yodda
Goldfield, in the mountains, was found many
years ago a stone bowl nearly 4ft. across,
with a carved lip; this now reposes in the
British Museum. Some archaeologists con-
tend that this, like other fragments of pot-
tery that have been encountered, is of Malay
origin ; but no wandering navigators can have
been responsible for the system of irrigation
in the Taupote district, part of which is still
in use. Here are paved water-channels and
reservoirs of such extent that they must
have been made by a permanent population
and not by mere voyagers. The natives dis-
claim any knowledge of the origin of the
waterworks or the makers of the crockery,
nor have they any legends regarding these.
If they were of Malay origin it is strange
that no physical traces of Malay descent
occur in the population.

“Clerk”: Which is the fastest train in
Australia? _ Although the Geelong P!in-
takes 60 minutes to cover the 45 miles
between Melbourne and the seaside city, it
does 38 miles of it at a speed of more than
60 miles an hour. The slow pace demanded
until it gets out of the network of urban
lines explains where the other minutes go.
“Carisbrook, dun.”: Roasting a bullock
whole? It was done as recently as 1926, in
Cairns (Q.), during that city’s celebrations.
“Hi Makai” : In the N.Q. cane town where
I dwell, law and order are maintained in a
free-and-easy, give-and-take manner. All the
hotels, except the seaside one, close their front
bar doors at 8 p.m. and open the back ones
at one minute past. All the main street
s.-p. betting shops advertise in the local
paper; the two-up school is one of the first
local institutions pointed out to visitors, and
lias a much larger congregation than any of
the churches. The seaside Dub doesn’t even
trouble to close its bar on Sunday. And
when on a recent very thirsty Sabbath the
services of an assistant bar-tender were
found necessary, nobody was surprised to
find a constable had found a new job for
the afternoon.
* * * *
“Eao-dah” : The ghost of Batman, founder
of Melbourne, should be pleased to hear
that his name has been attached to the ghost
of a bridge. Gaud Mayor Morell has
approved of the suggestion that the Spencer-
street bridge, when built, shall be called
Batman’s. ivinety years ago the sturdy
•sheep-farmer landed only a few yards away
from the proposed site.
* * * *
“H.K.”: On April 2, 1868, the Duke of
Edinburgh planted a couple of trees in Syd-
ney Botanical Gardens. They weren’t oaks
or elms. One was a. Theophrasta imperialis,
a native of South America; the other
a Dammcira, something like a Norfolk Island
pine. The second is still standing.
“Senojo”: Snatches of pidgin English are
liable to slip from the tongue in moments
of tension years after the islands have been
left behind. In a Government department
the other day a dour, unsmiling “head,”
who was once an island official, rushed out
from the Minister’s sanctuary, waving an
official file which had suffered much delay
owing to the red jacket, which denotes
urgency, having parted with the papers.
Evidently well-rattled by the Minister’s re-
marks, the head yelled to the record clerk:
“Where coat belong this feller?” The clerk,
with his island days suddenly
it may have been pure mischief —replied:
“Coat belong him he blanker-up finish!”
But it cost him a severe reprimand.
“Senojo”: Some people can’t lose money.
An office-boy, on the run after having been
detected at pilfering from the firm’s mail,
Cropped a postal-note for a few shillings
down the nearest sewer culvert. Avoiding a
fuss the firm dismissed the matter and the
boy. A week later they received a note from
the postal authorities saying that a note pay-
able to them had been fished out at the pump-
ing station and would they kindly come round
and Collect? They did.
* * * #
"Borom” : It is in strict accordance with
a mysterious law of Nature that the majority
of the children of the fast-vanishing Victorian
aboriginals should lie males (B. 31/3/'2<).
When a population is moving towards the dis-
appearing point, or after it has been ravaged
by war or disease, male births are in the
preponderance. This was first observed by
Thomas Norden, an English writer of the
sixteenth century, who noticed the number of
male birth in periods succeeding the
visitations of the Black Death. The same
holds good after wars. For many years past
male births have been more numerous than
female, in Britain as well as France and
Germany; in all three countries this pre-
ponderance began to be manifested at the end
of 1915, only a little more than a year after
the slaughter began. Also, in New Guinea,
where the native population is now starting
to decline, there are more boys in the villages
than there are girls.
“Narara”: I know a
school-teacher, an enthusias-
tic numismatist, but a sane
and normal man neverthe-
less, who has a small coin
which he firmly believes is
one of those which Judas re-
ceived for the betrayal of
Christ. The piece of silver
has been a cherished posses-
sion in his family for some
hundreds of years, and no
amount of sceptical chatting
by his friends can shake his
faith in it. And there is
at least a possibility that the
false apostle handled it in
his blood-mqney. The pre-
sent holder has letters from
British Museum experts, to
whom the coin has been re-
ferred on several occasions,
certifying- that it is a piece
of Roman currency that was
almost certainly in circula-
tion about a.d. 33.
“X2X”: I predict that
Yankee chemists will soon
find a way of removing alde-
liol, the new denaturant,
from the cup that cheers (or
maddens), and providing the
man in the street with rea-
sonably palatable hooch
(B. 24/3/’27). When pro-
hibition first arrived, the
denaturant employed for in-
dustrial spirit was methyl
alcohol; the fact that the
boiling-point of this sub-
stance is almost the same as
that of alcohol suggested
that its removal might be
very difficult, if not impos;
sible. But the bootleggers'
chemists soon had the prob-
lem solved. Pyridine was
next tried, and the removal
of this proved even more
simple, the slight traces re-
maining being easily cloaked
by the addition of a flavor-
ing agent. The new de-
naturant has no properties
which are likely to render it
any more difficult from the
viewpoint of the bootleggers
find their specialists. It is
one of the most significant
things about prohibition that
those defying the law can
obtain better technical skill
and advice than the Govern-
ment.
* * *
“Sucre”: Strange things
find their way into the Dead
Letter Office. When I was
clerking in the Brisbane
branch, an irregularly-posted
newspaper came under my
dissection-knife. Inside it,
in flat defiance of regulations,
were a pair of what are
now called bloomers, a
. set of false-teeth and a £5 note. The paper
was a copy of the Toowoomba Chronicle,
but, even without its illicit cargo, it would
have never reached its English destination,
for no stamp had been affixed to it. The
enclosures eventually went to swell the con-
solidated revenue of the State.
* * * *
“F.S.”: The young lions of the Oxford
Union who roared against the champions
of Australian universities have set a
fashion. This year will probably see a Har-
vard (U.S.A.) team of debaters cutting the
atmosphere with the American College accent,
which is quite different from the music-
hall variety. Also the subjects for discus-
sion may be more enlivening. They argue
queer things in the U.S.A. A recent sub-
ject debated in an American University was
“Are negro souls white!”
* * * •
“C.Q.”: The Diggers left at least one
aesthetic memento behind them in France.
The children who attend the school presented
to Villers-Bretonneux by Victoria sing
“Australia Will Be There” in a French
translation. The ditty loses a good deal of d"
banality in the process.
* * • ♦
“E. Mudhook” : Alkaloid poisons may h a )
been known to the Borgias and the Medic!*,
but “E. Metic” (B. 17/3/’27) will find no
record of it in any authentic history of those
times. The infamous Voisin, the beautifn
Marquise de Brinvilliers find the unscrupu-
lous Catherine de Medici all stuck to mineral
poisons. It is harder to find facts about tno
Borgias; but the descriptions left of tlie
bodies of their victims point to minera
poisons.

. J-ony Veller” : The remorseless motor is
King of the road nowadays, but it is curious
that England’s last stage-coach—link with the
storied past of coaching inns, hot brandy
and water and husky-voiced Jehus of which
Dickens wrote —should have survived Austra-
lia's. For long after railway-lines began to
gridiron the U.K. old-style coaches were
kept on the road, mostly by wealthy amateurs,
for people who fancied a flavor of the past.
The last of these was the Berkeley, which
ran regularly from London to Brighton in
the summer months. But the whole string
of horses used on the run has at length been
auctioned at London Tattersall’s. It is close
on two years since Cobb and Co. withdrew’
the last horse-drawn coach in their service
from western Queensland and substituted a
motor.

“Ibn El Issar”: Fortune’s wheel took a
quaint turn last week, the cables recording
that Maharajah Hari Singh, of Kashmir, had
sumptuously entertained the Viceroy of
India. The Maharajah’s last public appear-
ance on the cable page was when, as “Mr.
A,” or “the potentate,” he figured as the
mug in one of the most amazing blackmail
cases that ever came before an English
court. It cost him, or rather his predecessor
on the throne of Kashmir, £lOO.OOO for husli-
monev alone, and another hundred thousand
SHEER EXTRAVAGANCE.
MRS. FYNN (to Auntie) : “Yes, Em real mad with Tim. ’Ere he (joes an’ buys a baro-
meter so as we can tell when it's goin' to rain! Now I ask you ’ what ’ s his
rheumatics for?"
would have followed if it had not been for a
bank-manager’s curiosity. Still, Hari is evi-
dently far from broke, for it is reported that
lie formally welcomed the viceroy with a
gold carpet and a gold throne.
u -lA .L. : It happened the other day in a
-Melbourne operating-theatre. The patient
was well under the anesthetic, and the
anaesthetist was, as is customary, watching
the patient's eye reactions. Suddenly he
announced that his charge was on the point
oi collapse. The operating surgeon, after
a wild bustle of oxygen applications, felt
the patient’s pulse and declared that he was
in good shape. The administrator of the
dope had unwittingly been watching a glass-
eye !
'‘Black Tracker” ; How's this for coals of
hre? In a country town in S. Aus. the
Salvation Army captain had a grudge against
the local brewer and never missed an oppor-
tunity of making vicious references to the
man of malt and his wares. Seldom a week
passed without a meeting being held in
front of the brewery, and prayers were fre-
quently offered up that the spring from
which the supply of God’s pure water was
taken to be converted into pernicious liquor
might give out. It hasn’t yet. but when the
brewer died h e left £4OO to the Army’s self-
denial fund.
“The Rumpus”: The tyres of a motor-
car railed to an up-country Westralian
station had been damaged, the consignee
alleged, by nails sticking up in the floor of the
truck. The department ordered an inquiry,
and the loader and stower had to toe the
line. The latter solemnly declared he had
swept the truck carefully and was positive
there wasn’t a nail left in it. “Well,” said the
officer, “you will have to be still more careful
in the future.” “I can’t be,” retorted the
other. Oh, yes you can,” said the investi-
gator. “The next time you have a car to
load, take off your boots and socks and
run your bare feet over the floor of it.”

“Wang”: Speaking of relics of the past
exhumed from buildings in the course of
destruction (B. 24/3/’27). A few days ago
workmen engaged in demolishing the spire of
the old Presbyterian Church in Ryrie-street,
Geelong, came on a stonemason’s chisel with
the initials N.B. stamped on it. It is thought
to have been the property of one Nath-
aniel Brown, who built the church in the
'fifties. Another relic, this time of the bad
old days, was dredged up by a contractor
engaged in excavations for the foundations of
a new picture-theatre at St. Kilda. It was
a pair of very rusty leg-irons, buried eight
feet deep.

“Carisbrook, Jun.”: Like everything else
in Queensland, the price for being caught
“jumping the rattler” has advanced till it
is becoming an almost prohibitive pastime.
In pre-war days the sundowner who was
caught travelling on the nod could rely on
escaping with a five-bob fine. Seven men
who faced the beak charged with the offence
at Dilly were called upon to pay £2, £3,
and in one case £6. with the alternative of
imprisonment. Most of the offenders pre-
ferred the latter.
“Linklater”: The flood that swept away
the Fossilbrook ( N.Q.) township was respon-
sible for the destruction of four bridges
and a long span of the railway-line be-
tween Almaden and
Forsayth. The jo
of getting food sup
plies to the peopl
on the western sidi
was tackled with
characteristic grit.
Motor-trolleys were
used on the good
sections; often the
loads had to b
carried across rag l
ing creeks, waist-
deep ip water, and
re-loaded on the
other side. At
Junction Creek re-
lief workers had to
swim, carrying with
them the ends of
long, light, wire
ropes. Heavier
ropes were then
hauled across, and
from stout trees
four chains apart
an aerial tramway
was constructed
On this the motor
trolley was slung,
and brought across.
Twice the cable
broke and had to
be repaired, but
the precious sup-
plies were recov-
ered, and reloaded
on to the trolley
that Einasleigii
might be fed.

“C.Q.”: Although
Melbourne needs at

never uses. In fact,
for fear a goat or
a boy should cross
it in error, it is
closed by a picket
fence. It was built
40 years ago to
join Ivew to Fair-
field, and for a week or so a railway-train
occasionally ran over it. It cost £60,000,
gets an occasional coat of paint and mulcts
the ratepayers for £3OOO a year in interest;
yet it hasn’t been used for 36 years.

“Xepa”: I know one place in Australia
where the fish go straight
from the water into the
frying-pan (B. 7/3/’27).
Drifting from Avon
Downs into Urandangie
(which is almost as far
out back in Queensland
as one can get) through
a sticky waste of black-
soil, we parked at the
only pub the place boasts.
Although it was about'
midnight Bung inquired
if we would eat, and
added that corned-beef
and fish wer > at our dis-
posal. We naturally
thought the fish would be
tinned, and were frankly
incredulous when he as-
sured us that they would
he as fresh as any we
had ever tasted. And
so it proved. The fish,
yellow-belly and black
perch, previously taken
in the Georgina, were
kept in ships’ tanks sunk
in the ground, and were
fed daily with beef. They
weighed from three to five
pounds.
Fcng-Shui’ : It isn't the first time the
Standard Oil house in Nanking lias been the
sole refuge of the white community of Hsia
Kuan, the foreign settlement. I foregathered
in its sitting-room with merchants, mission-
aries and officers from a British warship (the
Yarmouth, if I remember rightly) one Sun-
day morning in the summer of 1!)13. when
It was the only building left standing out-
side the Chinese city, where, after a siege
of several weeks, dogs were eating the corpses
and the inhabitants were wasting nothing
by eating the dogs. In those days anti-
Furopeanism wasn’t the fashion, and both
sides to the squabble were falling over them-
selves to curry favor with the whites. Con-
sequently nobody thought there was anything
incongruous in this party of neutrals'going
out to view the scrap. One end of the ramb-
ling city was already being looted systemati-
cally by the Peking troops, while the other
was being cleared of the Southern rebels.
One piquant picture was that of a soldi.-
sitting on a pile of domestic rubbish with h
rifle across his knee, being dragged in a
handcart by the owner of the ruhh ~
THE SWEET CHILD AGAIN.

THE KID (after reflection): “Mummy, why don't you wear bangles?"
Northern camp. That picture was repeated
until we wondered how the victorious army
would ever get on the march again. We
had a yarn with one of the rebel commanders
and then took rickshaws to the other side
and talked to a Northern colonel. Then, by
presenting our cards, we gained admission to
a fort, and the officer in charge threw a
shell across the landscape to satisfy the
curiosity of a war-office expert. Finally, one
of our party, who had been taking excessive
risks, got a bullet through a fleshy part of
his anatomy. He thought extra-territorialitj
conferred immunity from stray Chinese bul-
lets as well as from Chinese laws, and he was
most aggrieved.

“Narara”: Speaking of the vagaries of
old-time justices (B. 24/3/’27). Many years
ago I was in a Queensland town when :i
farmer was charged with stealing a maul
and iron wedges, the property of a neighbor-
ing cocky. Three local Shallows were on the
bench, all friends of the accused. The case
for the prosecution was that the maul and
wedges had been left alongside a log near
the fence which divided the two properties,
that they had disappeared and had subse-
quently been located in the other fellow’s
yard. The latter, asked to account for his
possession of the swore that he
found them floating down the river in a
bag. The bench, without calling any
further evidence, dismissed the case. Later
in the. afternoon I saw the magistrates and
tlie victim of unjust suspicion celebrating
together.

Or would you father’s admiration wake,

To be a beauty but for Beauty’s sake?

You bind those locks more golden than the

Merely to captivate some luckless chap
Who lately chanced to cross your willing

Did I but know your victim’s name, I vow
I’d go to him, and whisper in his ear
He'll find you later wdiat lie thinks you

In quite another sense—a little dear.

And lead him this temptation safely by;
I know your sort; indelibly you stand,
A costly picture in my fancy’s eye.
Indeed. I know you. Would that I might

For whom you have prepared this piteous

Hitherto the amount written off profits
against depreciation has been disclosed in
the accounts. In the introductory table the
sum was included as profit and then shown
as written off. On this occasion the amount
is not stated, and so what was the co.’s
greatest year makes a comparatively
poor showing in the table. As against that,
dividends on pref. shares (now a substantial
item) are for the first time included. The
change suggests that the management fore-
sees the necessity of hiding what it has
made or what it hopes to make-—which gives
insiders a pull that does not always conduce
to popularity on the market.
A feature of the 12 months was the end-
ing of the price war with the K. F. B. Co.
The way out of the difficulty was an
arrangement whereby through the purchase of
27,800 £1 fully-paid ordinary shares in
K.F.8., and an option over a further 92,000
at par, control passed into the hands of
Metters, the bigger co. being given
majority representation on the board. The
shares were purchased for £25,020, and as
K.F.B. ordinaries are quoted in the market
at 305., already the co. lias a nice
little reserve in that item alone. Greater
value, however, lies in the fact that produc-
tion will be freed of the burden which it
must have carried during the long term of
price-cutting. Tlie market views the release
as of great importance: 12 months ago
ordinaries were sold at 28s. 6d.; to-day the
stock is firm at 435. The virility which has
marked Metters from its inception was as
pronounced a.s ever last term. The com-
pany stepped across tlie Tasman and regis-
tered a subsidiary, Metters (N.Z.) Ltd.
Factory sites of 171 acres were secured at
Petone (Wellington), and a local co.
which had started manufacturing porcelain
enamelled products was absorbed. The pup
is to be developed along similar lines to the
parent. During tlie term a freehold property
was purchased in Brisbane, and distribu-
tion in the northern State is now completely
in the co.’s hands. The Sydney show-
rooms and offices were destroyed, by fire a
few days before tlie close of the accounts.
The loss, however, was fully covered by in-
surance, and already the erection of a new
building on the same site is under way. The
failure of the Federal Government to assist
the co. by increasing the tariff on
stamped steel hollow-ware and aluminium-
ware has been a disappointment, and that
section of the plant was silent for practi-
cally the whole term.

Naturally, the amount sunk in plant is
heavy, and if land and buildings bulk large
they at least are in at conservative figures.
The co. has always written off with a
heavy hand, and although it has twice in
the past eight years distributed bonus
shares, visible reserves have not been neg-
lected. Moreover, the accounts are clean;
goodwill of £29,656 was written out in 1925.
Altogether, the management has pursued a
bold policy in manufacturing, and has not
been afraid to enter new’ fields, but at no
time has it been other than very careful in
its finance. The liquid position still further
improved:—

Fixed assets.. 99,319 277,551 445,143 465,350
Prosperous conditions throughout Australia,
assisted by too-free loan expenditure, has
been reflected in the accounts of manufac-
turing companies no less than in those of
softgoods retailers and luxury sellers. The
remarkable run of good seasons and the no
less remarkable facility in raising loans may
both be rudely interrupted. Metters will
feel the bump when it comes, in common
with the rest. Meantime, it would seem
that the management is strengthening its
position in every way. Should present pro-
visions subsequently prove over-generous,
shareholders are hardly likely to complain,
and, in any case, such safeguards must in
the end be to their benefit. The solid sum
sunk in property is offset somewhat
by the comparatively cheap pref. capital
which the co. has found no difficulty
in obtaining. In addition to the run of 10
per cent, dividends, shareholders in the past
seven years have done well out of par issues,
and have participated in one gift issue—the
one-in-four distribution of four years ago.
The enterprise of the management is given
a flattering valuation, but past results jus-
tify the high opinion.

Brisbane City Council has decided to go
ahead with tlie erection of its own power
plant. The protracted negotiations with the
City Electric ended in nothing, although at
one time it looked as if the undertaking
would pass into the control of the municipal
body. However, the council, on tlie grounds
that the terms asked were excessive, ended
the parley; so Australia is to see another
venture in municipalisation. Greater Bris-
bane Council considers that the needs of the
huge areas which lie within its boundaries
and which arc not at present supplied by the
City Electric, as well as the growing needs
of the Tramway Trust, will be best served
by a municipal plant. It will, of course, take
over the areas at present covered by the City
Electric as the latter’s franchises fall in. The
most important expires in 1940, when the
City Council may take it over on paying a
reasonable sum for everything but goodwill.
Twelve months ago the Council decided not
to exercise its option to acquire from the
company its right to supply electricity to
South Brisbane. The co. wiil therefore con-
tinue in that area until 1931. Duplication
of plant, mains, etc., is, of course, now inevit-
able. That is uneconomic to start with, and
the waste will be larger as time goes on.
The co.’s profitable progress was held to be
justification for the high price it asked. Con-
versely it probably played no small part in
influencing the Council to enter the field
itself.
Demands for power throughout the area
the co. enters have been consistently strong,
necessitating continual increase in plant aiid
services. A clear indication is visible from
this comparison of figures:—

In August last 200,000 new shares were
issued to shareholders at par, a sweet gift,
seeing that the market price for the last 12
months has averaged about 265. Most of the
money went into new plant, although some
was used in reduction of bank overdraft. In
1916 paid capital was £231,037, and property,
plant, mains and other fixed assets were in
at £198,771. The progress represented by’
the figures quoted is amazing. Throughout
good divs. have been paid; there have been
issues of new capital to shareholders at
par; and £399,843 has been visibly accu-
mulated, which “purchase account, £62,723,”
reduces to the net £337,320 of the introduc-
tory table. With those striking figures
before them, it is not surprising
that the City Fathers are keen on having a
go for themselves. At the close of the
accounts there were liquids and semi-liquids
amounting to £123,515 to cover creditor items
amounting to £147,484, £37,776 being bank
overdraft (down £15,718). Liabilities, how-
ever, include consumers’ deposits, a more or
less fixed item. The preference shares are
in excellent position, both as to div. and
security. At December 31 net tangibles
were equal to 255. 3d. for every £ of capital
of all classes,

Net profit of £12,144 was made for the
12 mouths plus £783 surplus won from the
sale of one of the co.’s Newcastle properties,
which was carried direct to reserve. The
directors distributed £13,181. In the report
they expressed their confidence that the evi-
dence of continued improvement would afford
satisfaction to shareholders. It certainly
will be difficult for them to extract any
extraordinary degree of comfort from the
accounts, although the ninepeuny div. on the
325. 6d. shares will perhaps brighten their
outlook. The position after the distribution
of the final div. is weaker than it was a year
ago. Nor, despite the board’s optimism, does
there appear to be any remarkable improve-
ment in conditions generally, nor in pros-
pects. There has been a suggestion in recent
reports that strong measures had been taken
to get everything down to bedrock, but the
accounts failed to confirm the impression. In
3022, after a loss of £39,425 was registered,
3s. per share was written off. Again, follow-
ing the 3924 balance, a further 4s. 6d. was
written off each share. The net result
appeared to be that goodwill (£59,000) and
some other rubbish was cleared off the pre-
mises, but the accounts still looked far from
attractive. Stocks, for instance, although
the impression given was that they had been
carved back drastically, showed only slight
diminution in 1925 and have increased over
the past two years :■ —

items are grouped at £107,63.4, sundry credi-
tors accounting for the balance. Gross profits
on trading increased last year by a few hun-
dreds, but expenditure also increased. The
slightest upward movement in exes, needs to
be watched —with an axe. The market is
not keen about the scrip despite the div.,
and, inasmuch as the reserve strength is
verv slight, it is not likelv that the shares
will increase in popularity until such time
as there has been a decided building up. Last
sale of the shares (12s. 6d.) was at 9s. 3d.
and buyers are scarce.

Australian Natives' Association, Ltd.,
is a non-party political friendly society which
mixes insurance with its other activities.
The accounts presented to the 27th confer-
ence, which was held at Manly recently,
afford a striking example of how shockingly
loose is the insurance legislation of this
country. Consider these figures from the
revenue account: —
Ordinary Branch renewal premiums .. ..£2,18S
Ord. Branch first premiums . . . . . . 2,585
Industrial Branch weekly premiums . . . . 35,630
Claims .. . . . . . . . . . . 2,859
General expenses, including establishment
charges, printing, commissions, salaries,
rent, branch management, etc. .. .. 38,651
There is a choice lay-out. the items scream-
ing for comment. But first look at some
balance-sheet figures. Total tangible assets
at December 31 amounted to only £15,861,
of which field and office equipment, station-
ary and shares in other cos. accounted for
£2326. “Establishment” was in at £11,817,
£2430 having been added during the year!
Counting all the tangibles as being worth
their book values, there was at December
31 £15,861 to cover various creditor items
amounting to £4039 and to protect policy-
holders in both branches. Figures cover all
A.N.A. activities —an impossible condition of
affairs. Not only can no calculation of costs
be made from the published accounts, but
there is no means of ascertaining how the
insurance activities are likely to progress.
The management of the insurance dept,
might be 100 p.c. efficient, and its efforts be
swamped by expenditure incurred by other
departments. It is intolerable that policies
should be written under existing conditions.
If an organisation thinks it can do better
for itself, its members and its friends than
the established offices, it should divorce
policy-writinsr from any and every other
activity. And the State is negligent in giv-
ing it the option.

Murray Shipping was formed in 1919 to
amalgamate the principal cos. trading
on the Murray, Darling and Murrumbidgee.
These included the Gem Navigation and
Mercantile, Ter me wan Wright’s fleet, the
Arnold line, J. G. Arnold’s boats —all on
the basis of shares for assets. Later on
Knox and Downs and A. 11. Landseer’s were
absorbed, purchase consideration in these
cases being cash and shares. The plan be-
hind the amalgamation was to end the com-
petition which had rendered the trade along
the great inland waterway very patchy. In
its first year the co. did poorly. It
then had a profitable run until 1926, in
which year depression of trade along the
Murray and a low level in the river com-
bined to reduce earnings, which heavier ex-
penditure cut still further. As a result,
ordinaries missed their dividend. Last year
an early fall below navigation level again
played a low game. In addition the more
profitable freights were _ affected by the un-
satisfactory prices ruling for fruit; and
new railway extensions diverted much trade
from the boats. On the other hand the
new slip at Morgan was in use for the full
term, and that was a help. Not only was
the co. enabled to do its own repair
work, but it raked in a trifle from work
for other barge owners. Passenger traffic is
also steadily growing: a trip on the Murray
is now one of the popular ways of spending
a holiday in South Australia. Balance-sheet
figures have moved as follows: —
1922. 1924. 1926.
Capital £64,800 £64,800 £64,800
Creditors .. .. 4,090 2,819 1,<57
Shipping property .. 62,885 69,342 59,304
Buildings, etc. . . ~ 957 946 3,176
Stores 2,201 2,584 1,985
Book debts . . .. 9,5 4 4 8,219 5,950
Cash, etc. .. .. 3,073 * ,829
At January 31 net tangibles in sight
amounted to £72,562, most of it in the
co.’s fleet. The 21,600 prefs. _ could
see protection amounting to £3 7s. 6d. for
each share. The vicissitudes of a company
trading on our bjg inland rivers are sure
to be marked, but the co.’s experiences
indicate that, over a period of years, ordin-
aries should win a fair return. When the
Murray is made secure to water traffic by
a series of locks, Murray Shipping should do
almost handsomely. Shares are dealt in
infrequently.

Black and White Cab Co., Ltd—A
reported aggregate loss of £27,486 for the
first year is a bad start, but things are really
not quite so bad, because £2346 of it consists
of preliminary exes, written off. The primary
cause, according to report, was inability to
run the taxis without a heavy repair bill;
and an action with reference to the cars
is pending between the vendors and the co.
One of the chief fruits of recent experi-
ences is that the taxi concern operating a
cab which will stand heavy rough service
without continually laying off for repairs is
the only one likely to treat its shareholders
well over a term of years. The problem, of
course, is to find that cab; and only actual
experience can do it. There is this to be
said: no attempt has been made by tins
co. to understate last year’s bad results,
and a management which lias the courage
to face facts in that manner is the kind to
get the best out of any situation which

confronts it. Gross income, which includes
results of trading of the old Black and
White Co. from October 1 to December
9, 1925, amounted to £41,550; £316 was
received in interest and rents ; running costs
amounted to £52,148, including £2786
allowed for depreciation. That made a
trading loss for the period of £10,282; to
which the directors added £9164 additional
amounts written off the new cabs, £5693
written off assets taken over from the ven-
dor (goodwill of £3162 was mentioned in
the prospectus) and £2346 of preliminary
expenses, a total of £17,204. The idea behind
the writing off is to have the assets listed
at a price within their true value and “lo
enable the management to start the new
year on the soundest possible basis with a
reasonable prospect of profit earning.” As
a further evidence of their determination,
the number of directors was reduced to
three, and their fees cut back from £lOOO
to £5OO. At the close of the year the co.
was leaning on its bankers for £12,610 and
owed £8553. The garage was in at £24,684,
taxis and plant, etc., at £33,272, with stocks,
prepaid insurance and odds-and-ends, £3096.
The directors are optimistic: they consider
that profitable conduct of the business in
the future is possible. It remains to be
seen whether the co. can do better in the
current term. Changes made in the ears
may have worked wonders. But will the
public turn in great numbers from (axis
that have proved fairly satisfactory to other
taxis that have been admittedly so unfortu-
nate?

—This eo. lias decided to reconstruct. Last
year’s trading added to the difficulties which
were evident at the close of the previous
accounts, when to a profit and loss debit of
£5201 was added an item of £lO,OOO London
suspense account which, then accepted as a
very doubtful entry, proved on subsequent
investigation to be worthless. The loss for
the current term, is £58,175. To the total
of £73,376 the directors have added the
£50,000 goodwill which they have written
off, making £123,376 in all. At the annual
meeting on Friday the proposals were made
that the ordinary shares be written down
from 12s. 6d. to 55.; that ss. per share be
written off the pref. capital; that arrears
of pref. div. be written off and the pref. rate
be increased from 6J p.c. to 8 p.c. p.a. The
writing down of capital will account for
£135,625, and of the pref. divs. a contingent
liability of over £16,000. Stocks are said
to have been drastically reduced and adequate
provision made for bad and doubtful debts.
Shareholders appeared to be in agreement
as to the proposals and the special meetings
will be held in due course. A review of the
accounts will appear next week.

Pratten and Newman have certainly put
Australia on the map again as a factor in
(he world’s supplies of tin. Their Alluvial
group and Larut Tin Fields report recover-
ies during March totalling 270 tons, which
is 5 p.c. of the total Malayan output. They
treated 870.000 yards or tons of dirt, real-
ised £49,715 for the tin produced, at a cost
of £17,731, showing a profit of £31,984 for
the month. And even then three of the
Alluvial dredges are still teething—Malim
Nawar, Kuala Ivampar and Kundang.
There are big lieadines in the papers be-
cause an electrical ore finder lias discovered
big lodes, 50ft. and more wide, at the Pin-
nacles, near Broken Hill. Big ore bodies
have been known at the Pinnacles for 35
years past, and they have been tackled a
dozen times. One of the first smelters on
the _ Barrier was at _ the Pinnacles; and
Odling, a pioneer of zinc ore concentration,
spent years there probing into the complexi-
ties of the ore. That’s one of the two
troubles of the Pinnacles. The other is the
irregularity of the ore bodies.

The National Mining Corp. of London is
leaving nothing to chance in its explorations
at Captain’s Flat (N.S.W.), where the
embers of the defunct Lake George Co. are
being stirred. The Camp Bird, Ltd., with
mining interests in Mexico and other parts
of the world, participates in the Lake George
option to the extent of 45 per cent. Since
October an Australian, F. L. Thomas, one
of London’s best-known mining engineers,
has supervised operations at the Flat.
Thomas arrived back in Australia after
many years in foreign countries and some
time in Columbia. To date the National
Mining Corp. has spent some £20,000 in
drilling, sampling, and development at .Cap-
tain’s Flat. When the old company aban-
doned the place in 1899, recoveries were
limited to copper, with a small quantity of
gold and silver of a total vale of about
275. per ton only. Zinc wajs 'the bug-
bear. Now the lead and zinc at current
prices constitute the chief ore values and
are the objective of the present option-
holders. Thomas states that the exploration
carried out indicates a line of lode extending
for more than 4000 feet, actually proved
where exposed in the workings to be from
sft. to 40ft. in width. Investigations indi-
cate prospective tonnage equal to 300,000
tons per 100 ft. in depth, and production on
this basis would indicate a capacity of 15,000
tons a month. Results in England and
Australia by oil flotation process have shown
an 83 per cent, recovery of the lead and
zinc contents and a reasonable proportion
of the copper, silver and gold values. If
expectations are realised from the present
drilling and development campaign, a plant
and equipment for the treatment of 15,000
tons a month would cost in the neighborhood
of £400,000, it is alleged, though the Wild
Cat doubts it. Cartage of concentrates
by road would cost 11s. a ton more than
if there were a railway over the 27 miles
connecting Captain’s Flat with Bungendore.
This 11s. a ton extra impost on concentrates,
added to the extra cost of all mining material,
appears, in the words of Thomas, “an
almost prohibitive factor.”

Carpathia (N.S.W.) meetings are not so
lively as they used to be, but the board still
gets plenty of advice on such occasions. Last
week it was assailed by an indignant holder,
who condemned the abandonment of a tail-
ings dump at Barmedman containing £3OOO
worth of tin concentrates. A director
explained that when the dump was aban-
doned tin was much lower than it is now,
and that the heap had been bored at the
time and found unpayable. Reports of recent
returns from it were greatly exaggerated.
Holders wanted a second shift at the Ardle-
than mine, but directors considered that ore
available was insufficient. The report by
N. E. Giblin suggesting sinking to make
winze connection and thus securing direct
haulage to the surface, has been acted on
and will effect a saving in handling. The
mine is still unproductive because of the
failure of the water supply. Even the cookies
in the district have started water-carting.

Manna Hill, Stuart Town (N.S.W.)',
spent £1209 for the year to January 31 in
getting 218 oz. of gold valued at £709. The
deficit, for the year was £2311, inclusive of
£932 for preliminary exes, and £875 of
paid shares issued in lieu of cash. Develop-
ment account shows £1155 expended on No.
2 tunnel, oft. which the Mines Department
put up £lO9. The co. had £267 in cash
when the books were balanced, plant was
put in at £2152, and other “assets” were
chiefly in the picture as “mine a/c, £10,046.”
The working account relates to No. 1
tunnel, all the mine revenue being from this
upper working. The usual inflated fore-
casts of gold to be won turned into calls
and Government aid.
Flagstone, Emmaville (N.S.W.), has in-
formed holders that a ss. call will be inflicted
for April, and that the long-deferred annual
meeting will be held next week. No news
of yields or tonnages since Lonsdale Smith
took over six weeks ago has been vouch-
safed. but it is evident that Smith hasn’t
found the 28ft. wide of 3 p.c. ore described
so persistently as waiting to be shot down
in No. 1 tunnel, nor the 16ft. of similar
stuff anxious to be shifted to the battery
from No. 2 tunnel. A proposal calculated
to raise the ire of holders is that the co.
borrow £2500 from one of the directors and
retire the debenture by calls on the 4500
contribs. Not since Federation Mt. Owen
has there been such a sickening slump as
the Flagstone, which nose-dived from £5 to
waste' paper with scarce a ledge to rebound
from on the way.

An interesting Adelaide flotation is the
New Guinea Reef G.M. Co., with a capital
of £75,000 in £1 shares. Of these 4000 f.-p.
go to the promoter, James Hallion, and 2000
to Captain H. L. Stowcr. The co. has no-
thing to say about its objective, save that
it is to acquire mineral rights, etc., in New
Guinea “or elsewhere,” in search of “ores
and minerals.” There is a possibility that
the promoter has located a reefing proposi-
tion on the Waitut, which is in mountain
fastnesses at the back of the Bulolo field. A
Bulletin man says he hasn’t seen anything
like reef formation nearer in than that. The
only reef shows that have given any promise
hitherto in that part of the world have been
on the islands lying east of New Guinea
proper—the Kulamadau and Woodlark
shows and some attempts at Misima. An
option in the latter island has been hawked
round Sydney for some time. Possibly the
“or elsewhere” clause in the Adelaide 'flota-
tion’s articles may have some bearing on the
matter.

“Matakitaki’s” solution of Kalgoorlie’s
troubles:—
About four years ago I suggested through the
Wild Cat that one way to save Kalgoorlie mining
was to amalgamate the mines into either one or two
groups, or, as an alternative, to scrap all the plants,
the combined cos. to establish a central treatment
plant to handle ore on a customs basis, profit from
the mill to go to the cos. in the ratio of their
holdings. The only better scheme I can see now
is to amalgamate the whole field into one company,
erect a modern mill in a central position and feed
it by means of aerial ropeways from the mines.
All the mines that matter are in an area about
H miles by J mile, and there is a good mill site
almost in the centre. If this was done the Kal-
goorlie Electric Power Corporation could supply
all the power to drive the mill at a huge reduction
on the present power costs on the field.
It is amusing to read that the mines are practically
worked out. There are millions of tons of ore
still in the mines of a grade that anywhere else
in the world could be treated at a profit. Mining
and milling practice on the Golden Mile has not
advanced in the last 20 years. Indeed, it has gone
back. The report by Kingsley Thomas shows that.
Chairman Bell said at the Perseverance annual
meeting that, the difficulties of amalgamation are
almost insuperable. So they are —if the business is
left to the present boards and staffs. But let
the various boards appoint an absolutely disinterested
committee to go into ways and means on the spot
and a scheme will soon be propounded. Bell also
mentions the difficulty in getting a suitable man to
control the amalgamation. This is bunkum. Were
none available in Australia, 50 suitable men
could be got in South Africa and America to-morrow.
If the Federal Government gives assistance to
Kalgoorlie and Gwalia it should insist that the
money is spent on putting in up-to-date plants and
in bringing mining and milling methods out of the
Archaean Age. The fallacy of giving money to pro-
long present methods is shown by the negative
results obtained from the W.A. Government’s
£50,000 advance to Golden Horseshoe.
Most of the world’s tin is at present pro-
duced in the Federated Malay States from
ground which averages about lOoz. to the
yard. From N. Queensland comes a report
of an area for which as high as 2240 z. per yard
is claimed. The discovery belongs to a few
adventurous souls who have spent much time
and money during the past eight years pros-
pecting in the Gulf country. They are
now trying to interest southern capital, and
if the average yield is a fraction of the figure
quoted they should have a fairly easy task.
The mines are said to be easily accessible
by land and sea, and a line of steamers makes
regular visits past the spot where the find
is situated, safe, deep-water anchorage being
available.

Boulder Perseverance for the December
quarter put up the best performance, outside
the South Kalgurli, recorded at Kalgoorlie
for some time. For the three months a
net profit of £B5OO was shown, and, in addi-
tion, £5OOO from gold production was spent
on bringing mine and plant up-to-date. Wliat
is particularly necessary at the Perseverance
is a watchful eye on lenses and patches of
rich ore that have a habit of hiding them-
selves till the opening of the tributing season.
South Kalgurli lias for so long turned out
a regular profit of about £3OOO monthly that
some idea of the value and volume of its
rich stope may be obtained. This stope is
the regulator of the monthly output, and,
as such, is being well handled.
Monte Carlo Co., with plenty of assurance
but little cash, has taken an option on the
Glenelg Queen at Hollow’s Find (W.A.),
which previous option-holders, Jack Mc-
Dermott and Co., decided to leave alone.
Monte’s board has handed the vendors £5OO
deposit and 5000 paid shares, and pro-
mises, if everything is all right, to pay the
balance of purchase consideration, £5500, in
June. Meanwhile, in order to have the
whole or part of this sum in hand, if
wanted, the co. is sending 500 tons of sup-
posedly high-grade ore raised by McDermott
and Co. to a mill for treatment, and is paving
the way for another call.
Burmah-Malay and Sydney-Siam are
spending a lot of good Australian money
prospecting around Renong (Siam), the
graveyard of Teddy Miles’s aspirations in
the Deebook, Katoo Deebook and Bagnon
Valley days. All these Renong properties
were equipped with bucket-dredges, but, not-
withstanding disclosed bore values, found the
soil too tough, and were consequently dis-
mantled and removed to more friable land in
the F.M.S. Since then they have done good
work and paid their debts, with something
over for shareholders.

Sumatra Tin Concessions, an Adelaide co.,
has heard by cable from E. M. di Villa that
the titles to its tin areas are unsatisfactory.
Di Villa added that lie had other tin conces-
sions to offer the Adelaide people instead of
the faulty titles. A while ago it was
announced that the Netherlands Government
would welcome “outlanders” into the less
accessible of Dutch territories; but it is only
with great difficulty that the Hollander per-
suades himself to part with titles to anybody
but a Hollander.

Silaya Tin is a Sydney venture into the
Siamese wilds, in which T. C. McDowell,
A. Vickery and J. H. King are the ruling
spirits. The co. is still searching for a
property, and field-manager Marshall has
cabled that he is now looking over a couple.
Siamese options are plentiful, but prices
asked by vendors are generally high. It
behoves buyers to walk warily, and in this
respect Silaya seems to be doing well. Of
the £5OOO thrown in about £3400 is still safe.

New Guinea Gold, best-managed and
-equipped of the Bulolo Valley ventures, has
come along with data from manager C. J.
Levien of the Koranga Creek sluicings. The
wash being worked is 9ft. deep in the parti-
cular section with which the report deals,
known as the Dovercourt Plat. The area
is 1250 sq. yards, and the face being washed
down is estimated to contain 3500 cubic
yards. Then comes the bald statement that
values go 255. 3d. per c.y. There it stops.
Bulolo Valley gold is admittedly well under
£2 an ounce, unless Levien has struck higher
values on the terraces which he is now,
apparently, washing down. If this eo., now
well on to its job, would let the public
know just how much had to be cut out of
every ounce in the races to pay for getting
it, there would be a great deal more con-
fidence among Australians inclined to have
a shy at the New Guinea shows. The co.'s
aeroplane made its first trip last week, taking
4hr. 40min. from Rabaul to Lae, which is
at the inlet leading to the Markham.

MAJOR MARR, the new Minister
for Home and Territories.
Alec Peacock, Yic. Treasurer, announced
at Ballarat last week that lie had refused
the Agent-Generalship in succession to
George Fairbairn, who will retire on June
.‘>o. He found it necessary to scotch rumors
adroitly circulated in Allandale electorate
that he -was going to London. The accom-
panying suggestion, of course, had been that
it would be wise to elect his Labor opponent,
McGrath, to save an early by-election.
One man lias occasion to bless Bruce for
his choice of General Eyrie as High Com-
missioner. A pressman in the Federal Gal-
lery made a book on the probable successor
to Joe Cook, and, as things turned out, it
was a skinner.
The most distinguished-looking man with
the Yorks is Inspector Hay, of the Special
Service Branch, Scotland Yard. He is the
most unpoliceman-like policeman ever seen ;
not even his feet betray him. Hay has been
with the Duke for about five years, and his
most thrilling experience, he says, occurred
during the Maoriland tour. They were motor-
ing along a lonely road when an oblong
packet was thrown into the royal car. Hay
caught it, and confesses that as he did he
thought of infernal machines. When he
opened it he found a dozen tomatoes and a
note stating that they were the loyal tribute
of a district farmer.
The Australian Literature Society has
lost a good friend in John Bernard O’Hara,
who was once its vice-president. O’Hara was
Lecturer in Mathematics and Physics at
Ormond College, and became principal of
the South Melbourne College when he was
only 25, but he is better known as a writer
of verse, some of which reached a high stan-
dard. At the age of 16 he wrote the prize
poem for the 1880 Melbourne Industrial
Exhibition. A number of books of his verses
have been published, and a London Times
critic, reviewing the collected poems pub-
lished in 1918, reckoned that he was worthy
of a place in the company of representative
English poets. In his flights O’Hara showed
little trace of Australian influence.
Bill Mahony, till recently M. 11.8. for
Dailey, was told at a complimentary dinner in
Sydney on Saturday that his testimonial
fund had swollen to £1550. One of the hosts
was W. M. Hughes, who declared that the
life had gone out of politics, to which Theo-
dore, Maliony’s successor, replied that it
hadn’t. The luxury of comparative indolence
has put its spell upon Hughes, who now
enjoys long-drawn-out meals where he used
to munch an apple and some peanuts, and he
saunters through a round of golf or a game of
billiards where he used to rush feverishly
from deputation to deputation and read tele-
grams in between. Theodore is young enough
to expect that the best is yet to come.
Hughes knows that nothing that may come
will be better than a twice-told tale.
Ex-Minister W. J. George, who represents
Murray-Wellington, is the oldest member of
Westralia’s new Leg. Assembly. He arrived
there first at a by-election in 1895, during the
Forrest regime. In 1902, however, he re-
signed his seat to serve a term as paid Com-
missioner of Railways, and it was some
years before he re-appeared in Parliament.
For length of service and continuous service
“Mulga” Taylor, an ex-Speaker, leads.
“Mulga” arrived in 1901 with the initial
Labor contingent, and has held his seat for
Mount Margaret ever since, although lie is
no longer a Laborite. Taylor is a N. S.
Wales native and George a product of Bir-
mingham.
It is doubtful whether S. Australia has
reared a more brilliant son than Paris Nesbit,
who died last week, after an operation, aged
74. The number of things he did very well
at different periods of his life is amazing.
He was at one time brilliant at the Bar; he
was almost a match for Charles Kingston as
a draftsman; he wrote sound English verse,
and his translations from the German were
widely known (he was born at Angaston, in
the German part of South Aus.) ; he was a
fine horseman and rode to hounds as dash-
ingly as his old friend Glynn did in his day;
and he was a tremendously powerful walker
and swimmer. Of course, he was eccentric
—embarrassingly eccentric at times —and he
relentlessly pursued what other people re-
garded as trifles and fired whole batteries of
heavy guns at them. An early instance was
when he appeared before the Supreme Court
find sought to have his name declared to be
Paris Nesbit —until then it had been sup-
posed to be Pariss, but the brilliant Iv.C.
(he was one of the few living men at the
Bar who had also been a Q.C.) found out
somewhere that “Paris'’ was the family name.
The family had, by the way, included one
famous man—Nesbit the mathematician,
whose “Arithmetic” and “Mensuration” used
to be familiar textbooks.
There were six Macs in the last Vic-
torian Assembly, which was dissolved on
March s—two McDonalds. McAdam. Mc-
Lachlan, Mackrell and McPherson. So far
one of the McDonalds (the man from Pol-
wartli) has been re-elected. He got a walk-
over. It looks as if McLachlan, Mackrell,
and McPherson will secure another lease.
If the people want more than four, they
can take their pick from McDonald, Mc-
Adam, McSolvin, McGrath, McCracken,
McKee, McGregor and McKenzie.
W. M. Payne, dead at Ipswich last week,
was one of the boys of Queensland’s old
brigade. A Somerset man. he came to
Queensland 62 years ago, when Ipswich was
regarded as the metropolis of the State, in
spite of Brisbane’s upstart pretentions. He
was one of the first men on Gympie when
that once great field opened in the alluvial,
but did no good. Back at Ipswich, he settled
down as a bookseller, giving most of his
time and attention to the Wesleyan church,
of which he was a staunch prop. He was
79 when he answered the roll.
W. J. Carre Riddell, who succeeded White
Knight Fitzgibbon as Chairman of the
Metropolitan Board of Works (Melb.), will
be given another lease of four years from
April 14. He is a lawyer with a taste for
administrative work. He is fortunate in
having as chief executive officer the adapt-
able George Gibbs, who began life as a
reporter on a Bendigo paper, and then
became chief clerk in the locomotive branch
of the Vic. Railway Department. Fitz-
gibbon lured Gibbs from the railways 36
years ago.
Adelaide’s Mayor Bruce presides over an
experienced council. Five aldermen —Cohen,
Glover. Moulden, Bonython and Isaacs —-pre-
ceded him in the chair. Two of the, five are
perfectly willing to wear the chain again
when the customary two years are over, hut
there are also
one or two inex-
perienced aspi-
rants who don’t
conceal their
hopes. The
mayoral elections
in S.A. are de-
cided by tin 1
votes of the
ratepayers, but
in Adelaide there
have been only
four elections
this century.
Senior-Constable
JAMES GHEES
(Vic.), the new
chief president of
the A.N.A. —the
second member of
the Force to win
the honor The first
was Thomas
O'Callaghan, after-
wards Chief of
Police.
David Guthrie, dead in Maoriland at 71.
was Minister of Lands in the National
Cabinet, and proved himself a good, solid
administrator who eschewed frills and made
no silly mistakes. Like Massey, his chief,
lie was Irish by birth, and emigrated as a
young man. A schoolmaster for over a quar-
ter of a century, he then went on the land
and became a leading light in the Farmers’
Union. He entered Parliament as member
for Orua 19 years ago, and after his
first term became Whip for the Masseyites
on their elevation to the Treasury benches,
holding that job till the war came. A grey
man, and serious, he made few friends but
never lost one.
The secretaryship of the Royal Australian
Aero Club goes to Claude Smith, hitherto
assistant-secretary and accountant to the
New Sputh Wales R.S.L. As runner with
the 54th Battery, Claude was in that mighty
series .of stunts leading up to Passcliendaele.
He whs knocked out on the Menih-road. and
that ended his soldiering.
John Christopher Bradshaw, Mus. Doc.,
who has been organist of Christchurch
Cathedral (M.L.) since 1902, and who ever
since has been one of the mainsprings of
musical culture in the Shivery Isles, nearly
came to an end the other day when he missed
his footing at the 11,500 feet level of Mount
Tasman and dragged his roped-up guide with
him. The pair managed to get a foothold
lower down and scrambled back. Bradshaw
spends his holidays in the Alps, but he has
more pluck than brawn, and Peter Graham,
the veteran of the guides corps, has had to be
very firm to prevent him assaulting Mount
Cook. It isn’t likely that Bradshaw will be
daunted. Generations of sweet young things
who have met him as a lecturer or examiner
have come to the conclusion that he has no
heart to be daunted.
Ivon Morgan Phipps, of Melbourne, is a
quaintly ambitious young man. He wants to
be a statesman —not a politician, but a
statesman. He won two scholarships in a
fortnight and entered Xavier College at 13.
lie passed the Senior Public exam, at 14,
and to get into the University worked as a
coalminer, share-farmed at 17, owned his
own farm at 18, became an employer at 19,
entered Newman College, and while qualifying
for his Arts degree supported himself by
running a boot-repairing shop at Elsternwiek.
To gain the experience of international affairs
required of every statesman worthy of the
name, he has just left for Hamburg as deck-
hand on a German steamer.
All men tire of politics, sooner or later.
Dick Meagher, who for 30 years was never
out of a Ma State election, is reputed to
have said that he would not accept a seat
in the Legislative Assembly if they threw
open the doors and played him in with a
brass band. Tne last to sicken is strenuous little
J. C. L. Fitzpatrick, father of the N.S.W.
House. Fitz. reckons a man would he as
well entertained teaching a half-time school
in the country as in Macquarie-street under
present conditions.
J. G. White, who has just relinquished
the job of secretary to Victorian Treasury
Tender Board, has proved a champion of
Australian-made goods. If departments
didn’t order our own manufactures, he
wanted to know the reason why. lie was
in the Tender Board otiice for 42 years, and
was secretary for 15; in his spare time he
painted pictures and exhibited a few at
Victorian Artists’ Society displays. One
theme on which he tried liis brush was the
entry of the Yankee fleet into Ilohson's
Bay in August, 1908.
Poet Gordon s old home at Middle Brighton
(Vic.) is up for sale. It is a little tin-
roofed house of commonplace architecture,
with a spindly-legged verandah. A local
resident tells how lie bought it years ago for
£75 and sold it later for £l5O. This time
it will probably be demolished to make room
’or a modern dwelling—unless the Govern-
lent or somebody makes a move to buy it
; a memorial. A few hundred yards away
; the spot where Gordon ended his days
with a rifle of the Brighton Volunteer
Corps.
Len Johnson, one of the old brigade of
M.L. Ministerial secretaries, has ended a
life that had lost its savor by jumping down
a lift-well in Wellington. When a reporter
on the Timaru Post, Johnson came under
the eye of Hall-Jones, then Minister of
Works, and after a term as a typist he be-
came the Minister's private secretary. He
was successively in the entourage of Boli
McNab, Tammas Mackenzie and Bill Merries,
After doing a bit in the Big Scrap lie became
p.s. to Downie Stewart, later transferring to
Oswald Hawken, the new Minister of Agri-
culture. A pleasanter-spoken chap never
staved off an unwelcome caller.
H. H. Bourne, Queensland’s Superintend-
ent of Telegraphs, has been transferred to
the equivalent post in Victoria. A great
worker for lawn tennis in the North, he has
been president of the Metropolitan Associa-
tion in Brisbane for years past.
A. S. Winter, the new principal of the
Zeehan (Tas.) School of Mines, is a Ma
State product. He was born at Sunny Cor-
ner, where his father was foreman bricklayer
at the old silver-mine. The family moving
to Queensland, the elder Winter got a job on
the Silver Spur mine, and Arthur became
lab. boy in the assay office, rising by dint
of hard work and home study to the position
of full assayer. He completed his training
as chemist and assayer at Sydney Tech.;
was assistant-demonstrator there; and. being
appointed chemist to the Conrad mine ai
Howell, worked out a successful process for
dealing with the lead-tin alloy made in tin*
treatment of the stannite-galena ore of that
place. Of late years Winter has been in
Westralia, where lie has done good work on
new processes of dealing with low-grade gold
and copper ores.
MAJOR-GENERAL J. H. BRUCHE, C.B
Australia’s new Adjutant-General.
A. A. Peverill, who used to be Vic. Under-
Sec. for Lands and Chief President of the
A.N.A., is off for an eight months trip to
Europe and America. He delayed Ins de-
parture for a year to do honorary work w
re-establishing burnt-out settlers. The tass
was made easier by the generosity of the
Vic. people, Alio subscribed close on
£200,000.
THE BRIG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“General Eyrie said he was not easily knocked
over, but when Mr. Bruce offered him the High
Commissionership, his first words were ‘Holy Moses!
This is a staggerer! lam not a diplomat.’ Having
accepted the position he would do his best for
Australia. He was noted for his command of good
Australian language, and if anyone went bumping
him in England he would talk to them in good
Australian.”
There’s a big robustious man
Known as Brig.
To the pure merino clan
And the Dig.
Squatter, soldier, clubman, sport,
Politician of a sort,
Wise to ways of camp and Court,
Ain’t you, Brig.?
Tiptop judge of fleece and hide,
Crazier Brig.,
And of citizens inside
Khaki rig,
But unlikely to create
Any stir where men debate
Intricate affairs of State,
Ain't you, Brig?
Apt to speak your mind, sans flam,
Plain, blunt Brig.,
Caring not a tinker’s damn
Or a fig
Whether you offend or please,
Who dissents or who agrees,
Unlike previous High (Vs,
Ain’t you, Brig?
Change from Fisher, Cook and Reid,
Downright Brig.,
And the diff., we all concede.
Fairly big.
For you didn’t scheme, like they,
Didn't fish for place and pay.
All unsought it came your way.
Ain’t you, Brig?
Though with eloquence unblest.
Tuneful Brig.,
You can whistle with the best
Catch or jig.
And if bigwigs bother you,
They’ll in vite before they’re through
Pungent phrases not a few’.
That may make them whistle, too.
Won’t they, Brig.!

BARNES LINSEED OIL
“Bamac”: I was telling Lofty Jim, an old
bullocky, some of the feats of clever bullocks
in The Bulletin. “Yes,” said Lofty, pull-
ing at his pipe, “an’ there might be some-
thing in it, too. The cunningest bullick I
ever knoo was ole Whisky. I called ’im
that ’cos he was a black ’n’ white. Whisky ’d
never see a man stuck, but then that was
Whisky’s game. Things he never knoo about,
o’ course, had him beat, but still he never
useter worry.” Lofty had two or three draws
at his pipe. “ ’Member the time I got me
ribs broke? I’m carting wool from Merri-
windi, ’way up the Murchison, ’n’ we camped
be some good feed. Well, I falls off the top o’
me bloomin’ waggin, an’ breaks me ribs
nasty. I’m layin’ there groanin’, when round
walks ole Whisky, casual as the day, chew-
ing his cud. He looks at me for a while,
same as if he understood.” Here Jim pulled
on his old pipe again. “Well,” said I, "what
did he do?” “Do!” Jim snorted contemptu-
ously. “Do! why, what any other blamed
bullick would ha’ done—went on chewing ’is
cud.”
* * * *
“Bihai” : There is much evidence to con-
fute “E. M. Pyric’s” (B. 3/3/’27) asser-
tion that New Guinea natives poison their
spears and arrows in decomposing flesh.
Arthur Darling, prospecting on the Mark
ham River, had three spears in him, bul
escaped and recovered. Magistrate Ryan
was wounded three times by arrows on the
Upper Bamu River without being poisoned.
Frank I’ryke got a foot of arrow in him
whilst prospecting at the head of the Yailala
River, and is still going strong. These three
attacks were premeditated, and if the natives
had had poisoned weapons they would most
probably have used them. All over the coun-
try, so many natives, police and others have
recovered from arrow wounds that it appears
certain no poison is used, and that when
death occurs it is caused by neglect or the
breaking off of a barb in the flesh where it
cannot be removed.
“Jimmy Possum”: Like many others, I
have kept my skin-covering dry during a
rain-storm by peeling off and stowing my
rags into the cavity of a hollow log or a
scooped-out ant-hill. The first time I tried
this dodge I was timber-getting, and the
mosquitoes nearly skinned me. I had to
take a header into a waterhole after the
rain stopped to wash off the muck I had
plastered myself with in lashing at the blood-
suckers. The tree I happened to be work-
ing had recently been scorched by a buslx-
fire, and when the black became rain-
moistened it stuck to my hands like treacle.
I never knew before that rain was so cold.
* * * *
“Wang”: “Torkin’ of native-cats,” re-
marked Larry the Liar, “I reckon one of
them saved me life. I was crossin’ through
a paddick where ole Jennings kep’ his bull,
a wild devil, he was; fierce as a tiger. I’m
not thinkin’ of any danger, when I hears a
roar behind me, an’ lookin’ back sees th’
bull doin’ a gallop my way. Th’ nearest
fence wus half a mile off, an’ there wus
on’y one tree in th’ paddick, a young blue-
gum ’bout nine inches through th’ butt. I
makes fer it, with the bull no more’n twenty
yards behind me. I whips a red han’kerchev
I had outer me pockit, an’ slings it against
th’ side of th’ tree. It catches on a twig an’
hangs there. I slips round th’ back of th’
tree an’ waits. Up comes th’ bull, bellerin’
like hell, an’, seein’ th’ han’kerchev, puts
his head down an’ charges at it. He’s a
long-horned brute, an’ his horns stick out
on each side of th’ tree as he rams it. I
grab one in each hand, an’ hang on fer all
I’m worth. He tries ter pull back; but I’m
AT SEA.
MATE OF SCHOONER (to stowaway who is working his passage ): “Lower the jib there,
d—n you! Let go the jib!”
STOWAWAY: “Rouse on someone else, can’t per—l ain’t touching per jib!”
fightin’ fer me life, understand, an’ he can’t
get away. He pushes an’ pulls an’ twists
about fer near five minutes, an’ I’m gettin’
knocked out. I’m just about ter chuck in the
sponge when a s’prising thing happens. Th’
pushin’ an’ pullin’ has got th’ tree rockin'
back’ards an’ forrards like a cyclone’s at it.
Then somethin’ drops outer th’ tree on ter
th’ bull’s back, an’ hangs on, spittin’ an’
clawin’ a treat. It’s a tiger-cat what’s been
shook outer th’ tree. Th’ bull sets up a
awful beller, an’ gives a tremenjous pull
back’ards, an’ jerks his horns outer me
hands. Th’ last I seen of him he was goin’
like a steam ingine across that paddick with
th’ little spotted devil on top spurrin’ him.
Yes, I’ll never kill a native-cat. No, th’ tree
ain’t there now. It died soon afterwards.
Y’ see, it got ring-barked be th’ bull’s horns.”

“U.W.8.” : Spraying for woolly-aphis is out
of date in Maoriland. The Cawthron Insti-
tute imported an insect ( Aphelinus malt)
whose attacks have rendered this aphis
a thing of the past in the Dominion.
* * * *
“R.H.V.”: A miner near Royal’s Flat,
Papua, had left a dish lying near his work-
ing. In it was about 4oz. of gold. The
natives were hard at work on the box. Their
master returned and, noticing that the pan-
ning-dish was empty, asked the boys who
had taken the “gold
money.” T h e
natives denied all
knowledge of it,
and one boy said
he had seen a pup
near the dish, and
suggested that the
pup might have
taken it. A few
red-hot adjectives
were hurled at him
for the apparently
absurd suggestion.
The master, how-
ever, had another
look at the dish,
and discerned in it
the marks of paws.
The pup was
chased, caught,
given a large dose
of castor-oil, and
then tied up. The
missing gold was
duly recovered.
“Tasiriki”: Can
anyone tell me if
there is scientific
foundation for the
belief of many resi-
dents in the hurri-
cane belt that a
summer with more
than the usual
number of thunder-
storms will have no
cyclone ? My 20
years’ experience
in the New Heb-
rides to a great
extent bears *out the theory; but then
it also convinces me that the moon and the
weather work together, and in this men of

“Gregor” : The real explanation of the muti-
lated rat returning to the cheese-baited trap
(B. 3/3/’27) is that the animal’s memory
had not retained the record of its previous
misadventure. Rudimentary intelligence, in
the shape of the mental process known to
biologists as “ trial and error,” is much more
highly developed in animals than is gener-
ally believed. The majority of creatures
are able to connect cause and effect. Rut
they all fall short of being able to retain
in their brains the records of this connec-
tion. One of the chief differences between
man and the animals is that he is equipped
with the necessary cerebral mechanism for
storing up impressions of things learned
from his experiences. Animals are seldom
able to retain mental impressions of facts
for longer than a brief period after their
occurrence.

“James B.” : The latest fish story belongs
to the Turon. Two men landed a 981 b.
codfish. Nine hooks with pieces of line
were in his jaws, relics of former battles,
and in his stomach a rabbit-trap. Of course,
a cod of that size could easily take in a
rabbit and trap. The rabbit was digested,
but the trap was apparently beyond the
assimilating powers of even this patriarch of
the sea.

fowls? In my paddock there is a good growth

feasting on the seed. The fowl pecks the
seeds off one at a time, which is slow work:
the turkey gets the stem of the grass near
the base in its beak and runs this strip-
per along the whole length of the stalk, thus,
with one sweep cleaning off every seed. The
fowls and turkeys feed together, but the
chooks never adopt the more efficient method
of the gobblers.
LISTENING-IN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At Dooran’s they have wireless now; across
the timbered range
Come “items,” from the far-away, of music
weirdly strange.
The songs sung by the famous ones, the latest
jazzing things,
And melodies from distant choirs —all come
on mystic wings;
The classic and the highbrow stuff,
The rude, the rhymeless and the rough,
The wireless wonder brings.
The family gather in the room, they seem to
statues kin—
Mere mute receiving cyphers in the age of
listening-in.
Famed orchestras mad music make; the far-
off bands of brass
Project their “numbers” into space—we catch
them as they pass
(“Oh! wasn’t that last note sublime!”...
“Just listen to those bells a-chime!”...
“My oath, that bloke’s some class!”)
We bother not with lessons taught—their
ghosts have long been laid;
No need to study music now—we get it
ready-made!
It travels not by any tracks across the realms
of space,
And though it isn’t ordered—well, it comes,
in any case!
Oh ! wonderful it is, indeed—
The very thing we bush folk need —
It quite transforms the place!
ANOTHER FEARFUL FEMALE.
BLOGGS (who has asked that his wife shall be bound over to keep the peace): “Ever
since we’ve been married she’s pursued a policy of intimidation, your Worship.”
But as we crowd and listen-in to this allur-
ing craze,
The older folk are carried back to other nights
and days.
They hear a concertina played, they watch its
bellows blow,
They hear a fiddle’s lilting tune—“a reel
choon, don’t-yer-know.”
They hear accordeons full blast,
Mouth-organs, too, pervade the past
That musicked long ago.
And ancient eyes with mists grow dim; come
memories by the score
Of Irish jigs and Scottish reels upon a rough
wood flo»r.
They see the Lancers danced again by many
Kates and Bills —
A stirring scene of blucher boots, of trailing
skirts and frills.
They hear a lusty-voiced M.C.
Announcing that the next will be
The first set of quadrilles.
And there were sweet romances then (how
different from these!),
When moon and stars and frondage wove
nocturnal filagrees.
Inside someone a fiddle rasped (it’s now a
violin)
When there were love-tales to be told, and
fluttering hearts to win....
The old folk live it all again—
The lucky pleading or the vain—
With Cupid listening in.

“ J.G.”: If either “Bihai” (B. 3/3/’27)
or “Mug Gardener” can produce the three
primary colors in any of the plants men-
tioned by me there will be a fortune wait-
ing for him. A true yellow aster or sweet-
pea or a blue stock, blue gladiolus, blue pen-
stemon or yellow lobelia would be worth a
lot of money to the grower. There is a
pure yellow pea, a native of Australia, but
it belongs to an entirely different family
from the cultivated sweet-pea. Regarding
the salvia that both these Abo. correspond-
ents say has yellow flowers, its dirty white
or putty-shade of bloom cannot be termed
yellow. Probably both have fallen into
error in taking orange for either red or
yellow, or violet, purple and maroon for
blue or red. These, however, are secondary,
not primary, colors. Some pansies bear
bright orange-red blooms, but they are not
true red.

“Telor” : The official maps and records of
the Queensland Hands Department should
convince “Sucre” (B. 10/3/’27) that there
is no prickly-pear nearer the Cooper than
200 miles, but if he discredits them he
should go and see for himself. If he finds
any pear I'll pay exes., eat all lie spots,
raw, and then throw myself into his Hake
Yamma Yamma. There is occasionally as
great a depth as IS inches over a small part
of that richly-grassed depression.

“Gawn”: The boss engaged old Joe
Thompson to dig out rabbit burrows on the
station, and agreed to pay him 3d. per scalp.
One afternoon I came across Joe operating
on a warren. He had'dug a trench to reach
a burrow, and his dog, a huge half-bred
mastiff, with a mouth as big as a shark’s,
stood in the trench behind him, ready to
grab any bunny
that might chance
to holt between his
master’s legs. I
sat and watched
the m. Suddenly
the old man drop-
ped on his knees,
muttering, “A nest
of th’ blanks,” and
his dog became ex-
ceedingly alert and
watclif u 1. Joe
thrust in his hand,
and pulled out a
quarter - grown
bunny. He broke
its neck dexter-
ously. and tossed it
behind him. His
eye roamed over
the contents of the
next, and I heard
him mutter, “Nine
of th’ blanks, that’s
two-an’ yes,
thruppence.” As
Joe yanked out
each squealing kit-
ten and dislocated
its spinal column,
he tossed it, so he
thought, into the
trench behind him.
But the dog with
the prodigious
mouth opened it
wide, and each
threepennorth fell
into it and dis-
appeared. Joe rose
to his feet with a
pleased expression
on his face, and
turned round. The
half-breed was just
bolting the last bit of fur. That night, when
Joe asked the boss to recommend him a good
dog-emetic, that gentleman hurriedly agreed
to allow the nine swallowed rabbits to be
added to the tally.

“Ess”: John Chinaman, who is a common
wayfarer on the back tracks of Queensland,
carries his swag in the same way as he
carries his vegetables, the jonkin, or bamboo,
across his shoulder, with his wardrobe dang-
ling from one end of it, and his tucker and
campware from the other. It looks a good
way, too, and with his dog-like amble John
gets easily over long distances. I met one
on the Barcoo, however, who- seemed to be
in a hurry. He had the sole of an old boot
lashed to each foot with greenhide. His blue
dungarees were a bit short, but his hat was
a real Mongolian cart-wheel. “You savee
Tambo?” he inquired, dropping his load.
“How muchee far, how long?” “Twenty
miles,” I told him. “O Cli!” he exclaimed,
then shipped his cargo again, and went off
at a rapid jog-trot.
AN ENTHUSIASTIC HOME-COMING.
MRS. FINNIGAN : Does yer old man seem glad to he ’ome?”
MRS. HARRIGAN : “I never saw him so pleased before. Fact, ’e said it wouldn’t worry
’im if ’e never saw th’ inside of a gaol again.”
“Rob. P.”: During a rainy spell on the
South Coast (Q.), where red-oak grows pro-
fusely, a bullock will sometimes be missing
from its mob, and it isn’t unusual to find
it hitched by the tail to a sapling. In flick-
ing off flies and mosquitoes, the beast may
lap the hairy end of its tail round a red-oak,
and the strands, sinking into the crevices of
the rough bark, hold there until either bark
and hair dry or someone comes along and
effects a release. Occasionally the hitch is
so secure that the animal must either pull
off the first joint of its tail or die of starva-
tion. My pal and I once found a scrubber
so hitched, and our efforts to free it resulted
in a much infuriated cow careering madly
through the bush minus a portion of her
switcher.
* # * *
“Tongio West”: I have just watched a
most exciting chase. A shunting engine,
with a string of 30 trucks, was backing into
a mile-long siding at about eight miles an
hour. Five pigs being trucked at the yards
escaped, and, with a couple of cattle-dogs in
pursuit, started to run between the moving
trucks. In and out w T ent the squealing pigs
with the dogs after them, until the train
reached the end of the siding. Not one was
run over.
* * * *
“Up North”: A very handsome reptile
is the hooded lizard of the N.T. Four feet
in length, it grows eight inches wide, and
sports legs with muscles like a rabbit’s. Ants
are the fodder that gives it girth. Its chief
beauty is a broad hood which falls about the
neck in folds resembling a nun’s veil. When
at peace with the world it seeks a warm
log or grassy patch, and, pirouetting, raises
its hood like a peacock’s tail, vibrating it
slowly as the sun paints it with rainbow
colors. When on business it runs in digni-
fied fashion upon its hind legs with head
and forepaws held serenely in the air, look-
ing absurdly comical, with the centre of its
tail touching the ground and the remainder
mast high.
* # * *
“Bunkie” : Is the sense of smell normally
suspended during any considerable noise
(“X.0.D.,” B. 3/3/’27) ? I don’t think this
can be so, as in the Great War, no matter
how heavy and continuous a bombardment
happened to be, I always noticed that the
intrusion of one solitary gas-shell was speed-
ily sensed by smell, although its feeble
“plop” was drowned in the crashing of “coal-
boxes.” This was despite the air being
heavily charged with the fumes of high
explosives.
“Up North”: I believe the Melville
Islanders are the only abos. who erect
grotesquely-carved and -painted totem-posts
upon the graves of dead chiefs. The death is
commemorated by elaborate ceremonial rites
and a mourning dance. When possible, the
longer ceremonies take place during the wet
season, when there is abundance of game,
The warrior’s hair and beard, if any, are
first carefully dressed by liis lubra. It then
may be painted white or a variegated pat-
tern, or lie may prefer a barbaric plume of
cockatoo and parrot feathers. His face and
body also are streaked with ochres into
fantastic patterns. The dance starts with
the assembled crowd wild-eyed from sup-
pressed excitement. The singing and danc-
ing begin gently, the performers taking some-
times 10 hours to work themselves into the
final frenzy. I’ve seen them whirling until
long after their bodies dripped sweat, their
muscles quivering until they appeared to be
in a violent fit. Early in the piece the sing-
ing is sometimes strangely sweet. The voices
hum for all the world like a gradually-rising
windstorm amongst the trees, crescendoing
into falsetto notes until you could swear you
were listening to a hundred well-tuned bells.
* * * #
“Fly River”: It is time the idea that
recent explorations in the north-west district
of Papua failed to trace the source of the
Fly (“Bouragi,” B. 16/12/’26) was knocked
on the head. During the last 10 years only
three expeditions (or, rather, Government
patrols) have operated in that district, and
on none of these occasions was their objec-
tive the source of the Fly. As a matter of
fact, the 1924 patrol was given to clearly
understand that permission would not be
granted for it to cross into the Mandated
Territory, where the Fly has its source in
the Victor Emmanuel ranges. “Bouragi”
also states that the present expedition to the
source of the Fly is provided with more data
than its predecessors. It certainly is, and
it must not be forgotten that these data were
collected by its predecessors.
• * * •
“Morob”: The stingray does possess a
poison-gland (B. 3/3/’27), although not
situated close to the stinging point. Around
the base of the tail are glands of varying
size, and the probabilities are that one of
these secretes the venom injected,, although
it has not been definitely decided by which.
Nor is much known concerning the manner
in which the poison finds its way into the
wound, though it would appear to be by a
process of diffusion along the intervening
tissues. Proof of the fact that venom of
some sort is injected is found in cases
exhibiting symptoms of poisoning by some
substance exerting a paralysing and mildly-
convulsive action, which can be removed by
proper antidotes. When the sting is fol-
lowed by suppuration, however, it is much
more likely to have been caused by septic
matter.
THE WHALER'S ODYSSEY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I met him on the Hachlan side,
A nomad of the western crew;
His whiskers round his waist were tied,
For they were long—his Molong, too.
He gazed with eyes that searched the past
Through corks that dangled in a veil;
And from a store of mem’ries vast
Unloaded this peculiar talc:
"I mind the year—’twas ’ninety-four—
When first Weeopened Bogan Gate
(We’d closed the blanky Bungeiulore)
An’ me an’ Paroo Jack, my mate,
’Ad formed a big Cargellico
Among a Hotto coves we knoo
To find out where did Dorrigo
While chasin’ that there Gundaroo.
•‘lt's Odyar never heard of it —
’Twas Oberon the Condamine.
We couldn’t get a clue to fit,
So Wee Waa bushed all down the line.
Then we went Gunning for a pot,
As we were Broke an’ Gonn an’ done;
We saw Young Cunnamulla shot —
It must lia’ Bena Barringun !
"All lad, a hungry time we struck
Along Byrock an’ By long roads.
We’d not enough to Byaduk,
An’ ’ardly strength to ’ump our loads.
It knocked poor Dirranbandi, an’
Old Sandy Hollow ; for, yer see,
We lived on Coonabarabran,
An’ Hay, an’ Bunnan Capertee.
“We let Condobolin the joke
An’ Trida lot o’ points lie knoo.
An' then we struck a Bigga bloke-
A Coolamon than me or you.
'E seemed a likely sorter dag—
’Wilcannia do the trick?’ says I;
You look a Mogil of the swag,
A kind o’ clever Gundagai.’
'■ ‘Just Waitawliile,’ ’e answers gruff,
‘Euabalong an’ weary lead.’
(We Adelong one right enough!)
’You’ll Nevertire if you take ’eed
An’ fix them swags horsccollar way—
Roll ’em out long an’ Bendemeer,
I Barham short. Fralla stray;
Urana risk with dumpy gear.
“ ‘You’ve Picton me, so Cooma long.
No Eaggan for a Nowra so.
Just Toombalup an’ foot it strong,
We’ll soon find where did Dorrigo.
Don’t dream of Millie or of Maude;
Barellan, too, an’ Nim’tabel.
Cuddell your swags instead,’ he jawed—
Behind ’im in a group we fell.
THE COMFORTER.
“’Ow do ’ee faal, William John?”
“Very slight, m’ son. I doan’t Fleere I’m goin’ he ’ere much
longer.”
“Cheer up, hoay; thee might live another month or two.”
“There came a Breeza ’pon our face
While Moonan nast the One Tree (ah,
I always likes a Coolah place—
Especially a Coolabah!)
Then heavy rain the blacksoil smote;
We sank in claypans to the thigh.
’Twould surely Boggabilla goat—
’Twas bad enough to Boggabri!
“It Warren fair! That Burleigh coot
Trundled us on without a spell
Through miles o’ plain, an’ Parkes ter boot —
It gave poor old Morangorell!
Then Grenfell too, while black as pitch
Night drove across the gloomy sky.
And winds wailed like a Yarrowitch
As we watched ’im an’ Mungindi.
“That settled it! We dropped our swags
An’ camped till morn broke clear and fine;
An’ when the leader damned our rags
We slung ’im down a Narromine.
’E’s down there Yetman, I’ve no doubt,
Among the nuggets an’ the sludge—
Some day, perhaps, I’ll dig ’im out,
I ain’t the cove to bear a grudge.’
He sank to silence where he sat.
That whiskered nomad #f the west.
I could not gather more than that—
Although I begged to learn the rest.
Now nights of restlessness I know
Trying to work the problem through:
7 wonder where did Dorrigo
When he pursued that Gundaroo!

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
DISEASES IN WHEAT.
"R.J.N.”: Contrary to an occasionally
expressed opinion, plant diseases are not of
recent origin, but, like the poor, have been
with us for countless generations. Philoso-
phising scientists sometimes amuse themselves
by discussing tue probable mode of origin of
disease in plants, a problem as abstruse and
as far from solution as the manner of crea-
tion itself. The stone tablets of the Baby-
lonian era mention the blights and pestilences
which affected and often ruined crops in the
Babylonian backblocks. Moses warned his
people some 35 centuries ago that if they
failed to observe the Commandments, the
Lord would punish them by destroying their
crops “with smut and with rust.”
The ancient Greeks and Romans were also
seriously concerned, and tried various means
of placating the deities in charge of this
particular department of human welfare. To
such an extent did the practice develop that
April 25 was gazetted a national holiday for
the opening ceremonies of the Feasts of the
Robigalia. Ilobigus, the rust god, on this
occasion was finally implored to spare the
crops from visitation of the cereal red-
scourge during the ensuing season. These
early efforts do not appear to have been
uniformly successful, and effective commercial
control of some of our ancient plant enemies
is an accomplishment only of the present
century.
One trouble, well known as ball smut, bunt
or stinking smut, has sorely affected the
wheat cockies through the ages. The rela-
tion between the bunt fungus parasite and
the wheat plant was finally determined less
than 50 years ago, and since that time several
important changes have occurred in the ritual
for the control of this disease. The most
important of these is undoubtedly the dry
copper carbonate dust treatment of the
grain, which has largely replaced the old wet
pickling operations. The dust treatment was
developed to its present state of excellence
in the Biological Branch of the N.S.W.
Department of Agriculture some nine years
ago. Manufacturers throughout the world
have been delighted to find an output for
their dried verdigris, in quantity, at prices
from 9d. to Is. 6d. per lb. The dose is 2oz.
per bushel. The American wheatgrowers
have copied the Australian example and over
300,0001 b. of the product was used in that
country last year; and all other sections of
the wheatgrowing areas of the world have
already come in on the good thing. Sir
Frank Heath, of the Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research of Great Britain,
estimates that it has put a quarter of a.
bushel on to the average yield of the wheat
areas already. A simple calculation gives
an idea of its value to Australia during the
past season.
It all helps to meet the country’s over-
draft, and Sir William Crookes’s gloomy fore-
cast as to coming world-starvation has re-
ceived another jolt. The N.S.W. Department
of Agriculture is still in trim and is push-
ing on with the good work.
THE WOOL DEALER.
“Trepex” : We people in Australia do not
realise how well off we are, selling our wool
by auction to the highest bidder, who, iu
95 p.c. of cases, is the direct representative
of the manufacturer. In nearly every other
country in the world, the mill man gets his
supplies from the dealer. In the old world
they call him a wool stapler or merchant, and
lie goes around picking up his wool at country
fairs and such-like by private treaty. What
he buys he takes to a manufacturing centre
and sells again with his own profit attached.
In the U.S.A., again, the dealer buys all the
wool from the grower for re-sale on his own
account to the user. In South America specu-
lators get the greater portion of the clip, and
in South Africa mostly-Jew storekeepers
and merchants get their fingers into the wool
before it is off the sheep’s back. Then they
privately dispose of their produce, which
they have had no hand in raising, with very
considerable profit and such fraudulency that
it is as much a byword in Kobe as it is in
Bradford. Japanese wool-buyers, who were
chased over to S’Africa during the war, will
tell you with what relief they came back to
the clean, free, open markets of Australia.
Yorkshire buyers, now in Sydney, but once
over there, will tell you of the cheatings they
knew of but which never put money into the
pockets of the growers.
The greater part of our clip is shorn
within a space of three to four months. So
soon as possible a start is made to sell it,
but so great is the volume arriving at the
seaboard that the selling cannot keep pace
with it. Apart from the financial undesira-
bility of dumping fifty or sixty million
pounds’ worth of wool on the market in the
short space of time it takes to come off the
sheep’s back, it is physically impossible for
the buyers to value the produce. Therefore
some of it must be held awaiting the oppor-
tunity of sale. The selling season is thus
lengthened out to six or seven months. As
is only fair, the wool is sold in order of its
arrival into store, so that the men who
shear the latest have to wait the longest.
These men do not like it. They protest that
they have to wait too long for their money
and that they often miss good markets. True,
they have had some unhappy experiences,
but, over a period of years, the market
averages out about the same for early and
late offerings. As for waiting, that only
happens in the first year; after that, their
wool cheque comes at a 12-montli interval,
just the same as any other man’s. They do
not suffer on an average. This year, for
instance, in spite of selling our huge clip of
over two and a quarter million bales in the
space of seven months, the market is most
buoyant at the end of the season. It is • a
very coarse clip, too, and much of it unsuit-
able for the continent of Europe.
Yet a big section of the wool-growing
community is ill satisfied. Their biggest and
most dangerous departure from accepted
methods is to sell their own wool on their
stations to dealers who go around trading on
a well-advertised discontent. These dealers
seem to have had some bad reverses, but they
always come up smiling. They must make
profits most of the time, and, in some years
like the present, their gains are large indeed.
ANY PORT IN A STORM.
Prominent prohibition lecturer enters a public-house for the first time in his life.
One has heard of a Macquarie-street (Syd-
ney) medical specialist who financed an ex-
perienced man in this sort of business and
made £20,000 thereby.
This country-buying system is not a big
one, but it is growing. The recognised
buyers, representatives of overseas manufac-
turing houses, do hot generally practise it.
The members of their association are under
pledge not to do so nor to buy shorn wool
that has not been submitted to auction. But
a few buyers do not belong to the associa-
tion and their number is growing. Those who
are left look with some envy on the oppor-
tunities that are at present available to non-
associated buyers. If no check is formulated,
there is chaos ahead.
PARTICULARS AT STOCK SALES.
“Two Seas”: A recent discussion at
Bathurst (N.S.W.) re the necessity for com-
pelling stock salesmen at the yards to state
where the stock they are offering come fi’om
opens up a big question. When selling fur-
niture, jewellery, etc., the vendor may have
a good reason for asking the auctioneer not
to mention his name, and a reason that does
not affect the buyer. But with livestock it
is a very different matter. It is most im-
portant that the prospective buyer should
know if the sheep or cattle offered are off
sound country. Many properties once classed
as sound are now rotten with anthrax and
its twin brother, “black disease,” through
their owners buying sheep of whose origin
they were ignorant. As a rule, when the
auctioneer knows that the stock he is offer-
ing comes from properties beyond suspicion,
lie states the fact in no uncertain way. If
he is silent on the question, the prospective
buyer should satisfy himself upon that point
by inquiry or leave the stock alone.
FODDER CONSERVATION.
“J.D.C.” : Given a suitable district, for the
man who can afrard to wait for the drought
years there is probably more profit in grow-
ing hay than wheat; but the storekeeper and
machine agent are not prepared to extend
credit beyond the next crop, and so immediate
sale is often compulsory. A scheme to help
the man in this position would be of all-round
benefit, and should result in the gradual accu-
mulation of a huge reserve of fodder, to be
made available in periods of drought. A
fund established by the Government or the
Graziers’ Association from which advances to
the farmer could be made, to cover the cost of
stacking or pitting Ids produce, would have
the hay or ensilage as security and would
enable the grower to hold on to his stacks
until the demand warranted a profitable sale.
At the same time the grazier in the droughty
area could tackle the problem of handfeeding
with confidence, knowing that supplies were
assured. Under existing conditions the com-
paratively small quantity of reserve fodder
now produced finds its way into the hands of
the big dealers, who are able to scoop in a
harvest.
One of our biggest pastoral firms tried the
experiment of purchasing a centrally situated
farming property and producing reserves of
fodder for its various stations. Going care-
fully into costs after a few years’ farming,
this firm concluded that it was cheaper to buy
in good years than to grow its own hay, and
the farm was sold.
It frequently happens that a crop which
gives only a moderate yield of grain would
cut a bumper crop of hay, but the risks and
expense of a long wait result in the grain
being taken off as quickly as possible, and
a firestick shoved into the straw. Thousands
of tons of what would have been good fodder
thus go up in smoke every year. (this state
of affairs will continue until some scheme
is produced which will guarantee the farmer
an advance to cover at least the cost of cutting
and stacking his crop, and will enable him
to box on until the drought comes again.
.Drought years would then be harvest years
for the farmer, and would not carry so
much menace for the grazier, as the accumu-
lation of fodder would prevent prices hitting
the roof. Until something of the kind is
done we cannot expect the small farmer to
litter his property with stacks of fodder
which are expensive to make, and which, for
an indefinite period, are of very little value.

BERKSHIRE-TAMWORTH CROSS.
“Bendee”: I have watched closely for
~ i, *
years the comparative results of mating a
Berkshire boar with a Tamworth sow, and
a Tamworth boar with a Berkshire sow. I
favor the former cross, as I find the pigs
are usually more of the square Berk type,
and if the female progeny are crossed back
to a Berk boar, the result will be very hardy,
showy pigs which can be readily fattened for
porkers if renuired. I have also found the
progeny of Tamworth sows are better milk-
ors and mothers than those bred from Berk
sows. The cross from the Tamworth boar
seems to retain the less pleasing Tamworth
lines, even when crossed back to Berk, and
are harder to fatten in the early stages,
being most suitable for heavy baconers. The
cross either way produces a type of pig
which will stand Australian weather condi-
tions better than any other breed or cross,
It is surprising that a definite breed has not
been evolved out of this popular cross. It
might rank with the famous Illawarra cattle
in the annals of Australian stockbreeding.
PRICKLY-PEAR AS FODDER.
“Static” : My experience is confined to the
Darling Downs (Q.). Cattle which are
always within reach of growing pear develop
a depraved taste for it, and will eat pear
even when there is good grass about. So,
even if pear does save a few beasts in a
drought, this is more than balanced by the
harm it does in normal times. For dairy
herds pear may be treated by singeing, boil-
ing or chopping to a pulp by machines on
the market for that purpose. Strangely
enough cattle on pear land prefer' the grow-
ing, thorny stuff to the prepared. Cattle
out of reach of growing pear will live on
the prepared product, but the cost of hand-
ling and treating is prohibitive in most cases.
No good thing at all can be said of the
fruit. This ripens towards the end of
summer, and cattle and horses, too, eat it
to excess. They become weakened, and a
severe winter causes many casualties. I
have seen horses breaking down bunches to
get at the fruit. The only way to save a
horse which has taken to eating pear-fruit
is to lead him away from all pear till the
fruit has disappeared.
“R.P.”: My experience of cattle turned
loose in pear country is that it takes the
average beast six months to get the knack of
eating it, and many die before they do; but
the advantage is that the lot would pro-
bably have died without it. Of a mob of 300
young bullocks turned on to absolute pear
country during the T2-T6 drought 220
were mustered in all stages of condition.
They were put on to first-class grass land,
but in nine months showed hardly any
increase of condition. Many W.-Q. cattle-
men hold that “pear-chewers” will never
fatten, even on the best of grass. My experi-
ence does not carry me that far; but I
certainly haven’t had much luck in fattening
cattle which have been long in pear country.
“E. Mudhook” : Re stock fed on pear. It
is said that after a while a ball of prickles
is formed inside the beast and eventually
kills it. I have travelled every inch of the
district from Barringun to Toowoomba, but,
although constantly inquiring, never met any-
one who had seen a case of this sort, though
plenty had heard about it —apparently from
the people who also hadn’t seen it.
THE WASTE OF LEMONS.
“Croesus” : Many growers in Vic., N.S.W.
and S.A. citrus areas maintain that it does not
pay them to market their lemons, and hundreds
of tons go to waste every year. No attempt
is made to cure lemons (unless perhaps in
very small lots), though the process is quite
beyond the experimental stage, and at this
time of the year cured fruit would bring
good prices, for many places are calling for
it —Queensland loudly. In the very centre
of the biggest citrus districts along the
Murray, near the junction of the three
States, it has been almost impossible to buy
a lemon towards the end of this summer, and
when procurable they were 3d. each! Fur-
ther, the growers in these areas have made
no move to obviate the waste of fruit by
manufacturing citric acid or essential oil
from it, though citric recovery is so simple
that each grower could set up an individual
plant to process his crop whenever fresh-
fruit prices were unpayable; and if the
manufacture were undertaken on a _ slightly
larger scale essential oil and candied, peel
Avould be valuable by-products. The Bureau
of Science and Industry in S.A. and some
of the States’ Agricultural Departments have
done a fair amount of experimental work
on citrus, so that definite information on
the subject is available.
THE LIMITS OF AGRICULTURE.
“Penfield” : It is impossible for one genera-
tion to say what country subsequent genera-
tions will profitably use for agriculture.
Lands which could not have been worked 30
years ago are giving good results to-day.
It is not 40 years ago that a South Aus.
farmer of high standing was sent across to
Beulah, in the Victorian Mallee, to report
on an area under offer. His written opinion
came to me later. One sentence read: Ihe
majority of farmers in the district are there
because they do not know enough about
farming to keep away from it.” From that
very land not so long afterwards two crops
totalling 52 bushels were taken within two
years. In the early days of settlement m
South Aus. a number of trained German
farmers came and settled north and west ot
the Murray. There were not many of them
who did not at some time or other cross the
river looking for more land. All they found
was “desert.” Actually all that was the
matter with it was that it "was unlike any
land they had seen under cultivation else-
where, and it remained “desert ’ for nearly
50 years more. To-day it is full of prosper-
ous farms; and Tailem Bend, from which
the South Australian mallee lines gridiron
off the main southern line, has become so
important a junction that the railway work-
shops have been shifted to there from Murray
Bridge. Even later the country beyond 1 ort

disastrous fires
For many years fire appliances capable
of dealing with fires of an ordinary nature,
such as might occur in offices, have been
in general use, but the widespread in-
troduction of petrol and fuel oil saw the
advent of a fire risk demanding a new
extinguishing medium which would, in
addition, be adequate for dealing with
fires involving inflammable liquids. After
lengthy research, the last decade saw the
introduction of the FOAMITE method
of F re Protection with portable equip-
ment and fixed installations producing a
fire extinguishing medium (Firefoam)
which met this demand.
Fiercely blazing petrol, paint, tar —
which defy other extinguishing methods
—are easily smothered under Firefoam.
Ordinary fires die instantly. The foam
not only puts out the fire but prevents re-
ignition.

Lincoln was reckoned a wilderness, and a
terribly remote wilderness at that. To-day
it is an established wheat area. Of N. S.
Wales the same story can be told. When the
Wyalong goldfield was attracting people the
surrounding country was looked over by men
who had been farming elsewhere, and the
possibility of profitably growing wheat there
was generally scoffed at. To-day youngsters
are sent to the Wyaloug district to learn how
modern scientific farming is done in dry
areas.
Machinery is largely responsible, of course.
This is the age of iron, and with a header and
team a man can do as much as at least 40
men could have done with the implements
available when wheat-farming started in S.
Australia. Technical education and research
have been almost equal contributors. When
the \ic. Mallee was first taken up in farms
the majority of the men who went into
occupation certainly knew little about farm-
ing—the one thing they did know was that
d the land was any good at all it was cheap,
the soil was loose, and the idea of many of
them was to consolidate the surface, thus
making it look as much like the old, heavier
farming land as possible. To-day they know
that the great thing is to well work the land;
the best crop that was ever taken off land in
one \ ic. Mallee district was double-fallowed.
1 his suggests that. the time may yet come
when double-fallowing, to retain as much as
possible of the rain of .three years, will bring
into cultivation large areas even now thought
impossible. One crop in three years doesn’t
look enticing; but big cultivators and cheap
traction make all the difference.
GATES ON MOTOR TRACKS.
“Billabalong” : Repairs to gates smashed by
passing motorists is a big item in some pas-
toralists expense account nowadays. The
,1 teller brothers—who, by the way, made the
longest private road in the world (100 miles)
to connect two of their stations—use few
gates, though the many paddocks on Boola-
thana dre on the main Carnarvon-Onslow
road (W.A.). Instead they build a palisaded
approach from either side. The approaches
are built in the shape of crescents; stock
walking up to _ the opening cannot see the
outlet, the vision being, to them, a fence
made of saplings placed close together. But
motorists and other driven vehicles can pass
through without even slowing down
No. 48”: A Murchison ( W.A.) squatter,
exasperated by careless motor-drivers running
into and smashing his gates, has invented one
winch gets their greatest respect nowadays,
the gate is swung on an iron upright hinged
to the gate post. It has for a top rail a
length of 2in. iron piping. Attached to this
Piping and swinging downwards from it
is a jin. chain net, having meshes of about
a foot m size. When the motorist runs into
the gate the chain allows the car through a
certain distance, but then there are happen-
ings which astonish the gate-smasher. The
lower meshes engage his mudguards, ripping
them off; the middle meshes tear his lamps,
! c '' a ' Tay; and the iron pipe is liable to
carry away his wind-shield and hood. While
Wn^V, iary wood-and-wire gates are broken,
nn^ ent Ji y without any damage to the car or
th . € !f e dreadnought gates are now
treated with respect and no risks are taken.

aa arg ument with one of these gates
recently, and his car looked as though it had
been dropped from an aeroplane.
THE WONDERS OF LUCERNE.
Bad Australian”: Lucerne roots will go
down until they reach water but no farther. I
of™! Vn dd ° ° f . “ alfalfa ” in the Acon-
cagua I alley, S. America, abutting on a
deep quebrada down which flowed a small
arroyo. One night an exceptionally heavy
storm converted the purling brook into a
raging torrent which undermined and swept
away several acres of the alfalfa patch, leav-
mg a network of roots exposed in the face
ot the quebrada. With the exception of a
tew feet near the surface, these roots had
gone down through slate and granite rubble
a depth of 9<ft., where they formed a
layer of fibrous matter about 12in. thick
the under-surface of this layer conforming
approximately to the ordinary water level
ot the arroyo Incidentally, what a won-
devful doer alfalfa is! I have seen it flour-
ishing at altitudes varying from four feet
above sea-level to 14,(XX). A warm climate
suits it, and once fairly established it is so
tenacious and vigorous of growth that even
atter three or four months under snow' it
is the first herbage that affords a fair mouth-
tul to an old or broken-mouthed animal.
WOOL CAN BE TOO LONG.
“R. E. Combing” : Woolgrowers are learning
something new to them. They are finding
out, tor the first time, that they can grow
their wool too long, and the knowledge comes
as a great shock to them. Of course, the
thing is only relative. The finer the wool is,
the shorter it should be: the broader fibre re-
quires the greater length. This is a more or
Jess natural condition of growth, from which
departure can only be made by breeding.
Manufacturers require something of a stan-
za™ for each quality. The set of the carding
and other machines is adjusted to the quality
being handled, and wool which is noticeably
ahove the average makes an uneven ragged
top and a yarn with many faults which
cannot be tolerated in the delicate process
of manufacture. The fibre in some wools
may be of the required 70’s diameter, for
instance, but of a 64’s length. Almost
certainly it will be bought for a 64’s wool,
fins is disappointing news for those men who
try to grow a high-quality wool and plenty
ot if. 011 the sheep. The thing can’t be done !
lhe sheepman can’t have much of it both
ways—m weight of wool per head of sheep
and price for fine wool as well. He has to
go for one or the other; or, what is better,
a fair medium in each. The nature of his
land and district should determine him as
much as anything.
WHAT MILDURA HAS DONE.
„ . • Mildura shows what one new
settlement can do for a State. Until it was
surveyed, not another township had Vic-
;? ria £ \ OI I S * he Mur r a U from Swan Hill to
ae b.A. border. Police stations there were,
wnose troopers had to put their mail across
me Murray to, have it picked up by N.S W
coaches. The towns of Euston and Went-
worth (N.S.W.) provided the only places of
social intercourse for the Yic. population in
all that length of river. In these towns
were born the children of Victorians; not
having any ministers, Victorians had to boat
over the border to get married, N.S.W. par-
sons being legally unable to tie them on their
own heath. Same thing with doctors and
sickness. All made for these towns for aid,
if able; if not, they died. Same thing with
schooling. If near enough, the children
attended the State or private schools ; if not,
in most cases they went without. The whole
of that country, about one-fifth of Victoria,
depended upon N.S.W. The Chaffeys
changed all that. Their colony began as
far away from Melbourne as it could get,
and it used the Murray at both ends at
once for transport of supplies and machinery.
Their town sucked in all the movable popu-
lation of Euston and Wentworth, and of
towns and districts further than these. Such
towns are only now recovering from the blow
dealt them 40 years ago. Settlement and
towns have since spread, fanwise, towards
Melbourne and Adelaide from Mildura, and
to-day it is not possible to travel from the
South Aus. border to Swan Hill out of sight
of villages and settlers’ roofs.
HONEY AND BEES’ TREES.
“Bad Australian”: I put in several seasons
hunting wild honey, and always found the
white- and yellow-box country more produc-
tive than any other. The honey was of
excellent flavor and quite free from discolora-
tion by the chocolate-tinted dust usually
found in hollow red-gums. In yield, iron-
bark, apple-tree and peppermint were on a
par with red-gum, but the sample I refer to
was much clearer. The honey from pepper-
mint forests was always more or less impreg-
nated with the peculiar scent of the tree, at
times so much as to make it quite useless
except for compounding in cough-mixtures or
the like. Stringybark always gave poor
results, and those from white-gum, messmate
and swamp-gum were very little better.
“Wandi” : Some people who settle in the
bush have peculiar ideas about bees. They
w T ant to keep a hive or two, and the first
thing they do iS to clear the land of trees.
Then they wonder why their apiary is a
failure. Nearly all the eucalypts are rich
in honey, but some of the best flower only
every second year, and when the axe and fire-
stick have left but one here and there, and
stock have minimised the small flowering
plants in the paddocks, the noor bees have to
work hard to live. Some apiarists, even in
good country, have to take their bees away at
times when drought has prevented a living
crop of lioney-flowers, and place them on
agistment outside the drought area.
“Conscientious Cocky” : Stud ewes are not
taxable under the N.S.W. Income Tax Act,
being treated as capital. But when does a
ewe become a stud ewe? As soon as she
succumbs to the blandishments of a ram,
says Mr. Whiddon—he put it even more
bluntly than that. Last week our stud
ram escaped from the pen and found his
way to the ewes. Now I’m in a horrible
dilemma. How am I to know which of my
100 ewes have become untaxable, and which
remain taxable?
* * * *
“Adsum”: Accidents often lead to useful
discoveries. One happened in my garden
six months ago. The lawn sprinkler had been
left active near a sickly 20-year-old orange-
tree smothered with smut and scale and
adverse to fruiting. We were out for the
night and forgot the sprinkler. Next morning
the tree was nearly cleaned of pests; and
thereafter the sprinkler was used every now
and then. Being early springtime, the tree
got a move on, blossomed profusely, and is
bearing a lot of fruit. Simultaneously, a
friend left her hose spraying an apple-tree
badly affected with woolly-aphis and dis-
torted like a rheumatic victim. Next day a
heap of the pest was dislodged and on the
ground. After comparing notes she decided
to continue the water treatment, and that
tree is now clean and laden with fruit.
* *3f
“Dugong Johnnie”; Since the importation
of the cochineal insect native birds now’ per-
form a service which greatly counterbalances
the harm they are alleged to have done
through distributing the prickly-pear seed.
The cochineal immigrants are slowly but
surely preventing the pear from spreading,
both by attacking the young plants and by
affecting young fruit in a way that causes
it to ripen prematurely before the seed is
sufficiently developed to germinate. Birds
are very fond of the young ripe fruit and
carry it long distances, dropping the deposited
eggs of the cochineal as they go. By this
means thousands of acres of dense pear be-
come infested by the destroyer. In this
useful wmrk even the much abused crow
takes '■ part.
* * * *
“Trepex”: Australian pastoralists are not
the only people who have formed a habit of
exporting their real and potential assets.
Maoriland stud-sheep breeders are carrying
on quite a brisk trade with South America.
Only recently upwards of 550 stud-sheep
were exported from the Shivery Isles to
Patagonia, mostly of the Corriedale and
Romney Marsh types. These, of course, are
coarser than our Australian merinos, but finer
than the average of the Argentine sheep in
their wool. This will tend to bring the clip
from that country into competition with the
Maoriland and Victorian half-breeds, whicli
in fine and medium crossbreds are at present
a class to themselves.
“Bar Iv.”: To cockies on land containing
ironstone who have failed to get good results
from using superphosphate as a fertiliser, I
recommend basic super. The chemical action of
iron on super, destroys the value of the latter
except under certain suitable weather con-
ditions, but basic super, is more readily avail-
able for plant life, and resists the action of
the iron. It can be bought ready for use or
may be mixed by adding one part by weight
of air-slacked lime to four of super This
mixture will not keep, and should be used
as soon as it is cool enough to handle
* * * *
“Jesmond”: I saw a thistle pulled out of
the ground on Phillip Island (Vic.) wffiose
root taped 40in.; and much was left down
below. Incidentally, I’ve dug chicory in the
same locality that averaged 3ft. 6in. to 4ft. in
length, and the roots were broken off at that.

“J.1.M.”: My cook-boy at Rabaul had

for time by asking “And how’s the old

him doubtfully in King William-street, and
in puzzlement he tried the old plan. “And
how’s the old trouble?” “Just the same as

off, but that only showed him how much
they were in need of his plain speaking, and
he accepted their challenge. Next time he
went he borrowed one of his children’s
leather school-bags, stuffed some bread and
cheese in it and hung it conspicuously in
front of the pulpit. And to make sure that
nobody missed it, he wound up his sermon
with: “And what I’ve told you is true—
as true, brethren, as that my dinner is hang-
ing in that bag.”
The difference between repertory plays
and musical revues is that in one the hero-
ines bare their souls, and in the other their
knees.

she couldn’t tell which it was. She looked
down from one to the other; then lifting up
both she whispered : “Would you mind taking
your pick?”

“ain’t anything to the ’roos out West when
I was boundry ridin’ on Wongabingi. Soon
after the ’92 drought started, billies an'
buckets an’ spare kerosene tins began to dis-
appear wholesale. I lost two new billies an’
a bucket that I’d left hanging on the wind-
lass rope half-way down the well. One day
I was ridin’ down the river, lookin’ for
bogged sheep, an’ strike me if I don’t find the
river dammed off, an’ there on the other side
w r as a mob of ’roos waterin’ the grass on
the flat with billies an’ buckets.* The blamed
things had dammed off the river to make it
overflow, an’ when there wasn’t enough water
for that they’d gone around pinchin’ billies
an’ buckets to do the job with. I watched
’em for a while, then lets out a holler,
tliinkin’ to frighten them off an’ get me billies
back, an’ damn me if they don’t all hop off
and take every billy an’ bucket with ’em.”

THE SHOCK.
When with fiddle lovingly
Tucked beneath my chin,
Make I dreamy melody,
Thoughts all free from sin,
Then my soul in ecstasy
Soars to starry height,
Losing itself hopelessly
In enraptured flight.
But to earth it crashes down,
Hurt and quivering,
When my fiddle, old and brown,
Snaps a singing string.

HAY HELL AND BOOLIGAL.
“Hay, Hell and Booligal,”
I love the rhythmic rise and fall
Of syllables that, lightly flung,
Go trippingly upon the tongue.
I wish him joy and length of days
Whoever hit upon the phrase.
No dweller on the plains could be
Author of that fine irony.
Some poet from the timbers tall
First Coined “Hay, Hell and Booligal.”
People who live at Hay, you’ll find,
Consider it is much maligned.
The somnolent old ’Bidgee town
Asserts a pride drink cannot drown,
And any man you may accost
Will say, “Hot? Not at all! It’s frost!”
And see! A very sign of grace,
To prove how un-llell-like the place,
The flying ’bus from far S.A.
Drops gently down from Heaven at Hay.
If place of residence be free,
Consider then this last of three.
Shearers, teamsters and what-not
Find Booligal a restful spot,
Handy for those with parching necks
To start the knocking-down of cheques,
And whalers down the Lachlan banks
Dump bluey there with fervent thanks.
They say (a doubtful tale withal.)
It snowed last week at Booligal.
For Hell, too, something may be said,
Though devils stoke its fires of red,
And though its climate, cynics say,
Resembles Booligal and Hay;
It does not lack, so all agree,
Most entertaining company;
Maintaining strongly, none the less,
A dignified exclusiveness;
So Kipling says, who knows quite well
The rules and etiquette of Hell.
So if I’m sent on Judgment Day
To hump my blanket down that way
And find, like Mister Tomlinson,
I get no welcome there, as one
Whose sin is tame or out of date,
Rejected at the brimstone gate
Against the lock-out I’ll not kick,
Nor vainly argue with Old Nick.
I’ll promptly SOS the call:
“Oh, take me back to Booligal!”
S.A.
BILL O’C.

They Say the Dead
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f HEY say the dead sleep very sound;
but I—how could I sleep
With all these passions locked in me,
unseen, unslaked, unworn ;
With half life’s opal shoals untried, and half
its unplumbed deep?
No, I shall be a restless ghost to walk the
world till morix!
0 restless virgin, fret you not, though flesh
and blood be wild.
When flesh is cold as other clay and blood
has ceased to run,
You’ll find your narrow bed as soft as when
you were a child,
And you shall rot as meek as tens of
millions have done. »

DOROTHEA MACKELLAR.
The Resolutionists.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE captain of H.M.S. Emu—which
smart and efficient fighting ship owed
much of her efficiency and smartness
to the fact that Mr. Gregory Wicks was her
first _ lieutenant —was something of a dys-
peptic, to whom the due celebration of Yule-
tide was usually disastrous. So it came
about that on the last day of the year 1817
Mr. Wicks found himself temporarily in
command of the ship, whilst his unfortunate
commander, Captain Fletcher, lay gastri-
cally overwhelmed at the house of good Dr.
Hastings—up on the Rocks, in Sydney—
enduring agonies of remorse, calomel and
castor-oil, as his old shipmate endeavored
to effect some improvement in the function-
ing of his worn-out stomach and his liob-
mxiled liver.
So, too, it came about that on New Year’s
Eve Messrs. Wicks, Calder and Pilking-
ton slowly paced the poop of H.M.S. Emu
as she lay at anchor in the lovely lake of
Pittwater, the southern arm of the wide-
spread estuary of the Ilawkesbury, smoking
their after-dinner cigars while the yellow
sky faded into night behind the sombre
forests on the surrounding hills.
As the three friends came to the break of
the poop, Mr. Pilkington paused at the rail
and permitted his gaze to wander. “Panthy,
my boy,” he remarked in a tone of lazy grati-
tude, “ ’tith motht delightful of you, I vow,
to have invited Patwick and mythelf to share
with you the —ah —tlxylvan beautieth of thith
bewitching thpot. We are motht gwateful
to you—are we not, Patthy?”
“ ’M-m,” respoixded Ensign Calder. “Damn-
ably so, Brummell, my buck. But, for my
part, I’d be even more grateful 'for a taste
of that cold rum-punch the steward served
us with last night. I don’t suppose he’s
forgotten how to brew it, has he, Pansy?”
The acting-commander of the warship
turned towards the cabin skylight with a
laugh. “I’ll vouch for it he hasn’t,” he
answered. “A lake of rum-and-water, with
lemon islands in it, and an anchorage of
sugar for holding-ground, is far superior in
Patrick’s estimation to all the sylvan beauties
of sea or land that were ever displayed before
his eyes. Jenkins /” he bellowed down into
the cabin, “a bowl of sangaree as soon as
you can make it. We’ll be down in ten
minutes. Set it on the table in the captain’s
cabin, and see 'tis as cool as you made it
yestereve. Plenty of it —we’re pretty thirsty.
Egad!” he remarked, as they turned from
the rail and resumed their stroll, “I’d nigh
forgotten we had to see the New Year in
to-night. Lord, ’tis a strange wilderness in
which to celebrate it—and so d—d un-
natural to do it with cold punch! I’ll
wager we’d be wanting something for to
warm our chilly guts if we were at home
this evening, my lads. A big log fire on
the hearth, bumpers of steaming grog and
miles of snow all over the countryside with-
out —and you might do what you would with
all the Yankee pirates ever invented. I’ve
to thank you two good fellows for sharing
my exile in this God-forsaken place. Indeed,
I have to!”
“ ’Tis all that and more, Pansy,” assented
Mr. Calder ; and after further talk they went
below. Mr. Pilkington' reclined loosely in
his straight-backed armchair and delivered
himself of an opinion as to the spending of
New Year’s Eve in other places than Broken
Bay that was directly contrary to those
recently expressed on the poop by his com-
panions.
“Well, then, now, my dear fellowth,” he
drawled, “I can’t thay I agwee with either
of you ath to the undethirwability of Bwoken
Bay ath a plathe in which to thelebwate
the pathing of the old yeah into —ah—-the
limbo of thingth forgotten, and the birth
of a new ewa in the liveth of each of uth.
To my mind, no plathe could be more thuit-
able for the making of thothe good wetholu-
tionth which are thuppothed to mark for
mankind thith epoch in the flight of time.
Here we are, thet down amidth the glorwi-
outh, unthpoiled thenery of a virgin world—
a world which hath, ath yet, been uncon-
taminated by the villainieth of man. We
are wemoved”
He was interrupted by the sudden arrival
at the door of the boatswaiix —a typical
petty-officer of Nelson’s day, with two feet of
pigtail hanging down behind his broad
shoulders, the voice of a bxxll, and a fist like
a leg of mutton. Bill Miller was his name,
and he was beloved of Mr. Wicks.
“By y’r leave, sir!” he bellowed in the
doorway, tugging at his forelock. “Them
boats is a-comin’ back, an’ there’s a schooner’s
not long dropped her mud-’ook below tlx’ ’ead-
land at th’ hentrance wot them naygui’s
calls Barrenjoey. Hofficer o’ th’ watch sent
me to liinform y’r honor accordin’.”
Mr. Wicks jumped to his feet. “Right
you are, bos’n,” he cried joyously. “Gome
on, you fellows. They’ve got her—they’ve
taken th’ dam’ Yankee we were waiting for.
Come on—we’ll get back to the punch after-
wards. Good —oh, very good.”
Once more upon the poop, they found that
night had come down over the great bay,
whose surface mirrored the brigliter stars.
Out beyond the long sandy spit joining Bar-
renjoey to the mainland the round yellow
disc of a full moon was just appearing. Far
off, but coming closer, and momentxxrily in-
creasing in distinctness, the rhythmic sound
of oars in rowlocks drifted across the quiet
waters from the direction of the entrance.
The evening was still and breathless, and
the night-noises in the bush ashore —the
croak of a mopoke, sustained by a chirping
of crickets —were marvellously clear and
audible.
“Who is this fellow you’re after, Pansy?”
asked Mi-. Caldei-, as they stood by the
mizzen i-igging on the starboard side, strain-
ing their eyes to sight the boats. “You
haven’t told us yet.” ,
“ ’Tis supposed to be an American vessel
that’s been chartered by someone in Ireland
to come and carry off a couple of well-to-do
lags. They absconded from Windsor at the
beginning of the month —one named Rourke,
the other Driscoll. Political birds of some
sort, whom old Mac’s very anxious not to
lose. Well, it seems that Driscoll foi-got his
writing-desk, and they found letters and
papers in it giving tlie whole dam’ show
away. This craft —if she’s the right one —
was to cruise about off the coast and run in
here about the New Year, pick ’em up and
carry ’em off to the Philippines. Scotland
Island was the. rendezvous—but they’ve not
turned up on it as yet—for Bill Miller’s
seax-ched every inch of it. They’re on the
mainland, probably. That’s why we’re here.
I’ve orders to arrest the scliooixer and take
her round to Port Jaekson, and, if I’ve any
luck, to nab Messrs. Rourke and Driscoll.
Young Bullivant’s in charge of the boats
that have been waiting under Barrenjoey
since we came in, and I’ve given him orders
to bx-iixg the skipper here at once, leaving a
guard upon his vessel. Listen —they’re
getting closer now.”
The captain of the American schooxxtr
which had run in on the nor’-ea.ster and
anchored under the lee of Barrenjoey was
a blue-eyed Irishmaix named Costello, and
the three young gentlemen found him to be
a person of much friendliness and bonhomie,
well able to accept the fact that he was
cornered and captured with good-humored
pnilosophy. It was apparent that he saw
nothing was to be gained by being disagree-
able. So he accepted Mr. Wicks’s invitation
to share the bowl of cold punch resting
neglected on the table in the stern cabin,
with what might almost have been gratitude,
but most certainly was policy.
“Well, thin, sorr,” he said, as he followed
his captor into the poop from the quarter-
deck, “I’d not be afther denying ’tis a plea-
sure for to see the Ould Year out in th’
company of Christian gintlemin. Me mate’s
a buck naygur, an th’ crew’s all Chinks
what ain’t Malays. I’d looked for a couple
of me own soort to join me here, an’ cillv-
brate th’ sayson properly—but ’tis not to be,
so ’tis not, an’ ’tis little sinse a-cryin’ over
spilt milk.”
They sat themselves down about the table,
and Mr. Pilkington proceeded to put the
captive at his ease, feeling sorry for his
unfortunate position.
“Pway, my dear thir, do not contliider uth
in any way hothtile. Your mithadventure
doeth not in any thenthe incur our hothtility.
We feel deeply thympathetic. Pway con-
thider yourthelf one of uth. We were about
to indulge our fanthieth in the good old cixth-
tom of making wetholutionth thuitable for
the coming year. There ith no harm in
making them—however lax we may be about
keeping them. Will you not, my dear thir,
honor uth by opening thith meeting of—ah
—fervid good wetholutionth, by enunthiat-
ing the wetholve which theemth to you to be
motht nethetharwy in your own cathe. Come
now, thir—pway don’t be bashful.”
Captain Costello laughed good-naturedly.
“Well, thin, me good sir,” he said, “there’s
so many good resolutions I’ve made—iver
since I was a little spalpeen, so high—that
I’m afther thinkin’ there’s hardly a fresh one
left for me to be makin’ now. Howiver,
since ye press me, I’ll be a-tellin’ th’ lot
o' ye—an’ no ill-feelin’ about it, at all, at
all—that I’m raysolved niver again for to
be tuk a-nappin’ like I was be that young
midshipman at tlx’ harbor mouth this even-
ing. May I bust me bilge if iver I come
into anuy poort in tli’ wide worruld again
without knowin’ wliat’s inside it. ’Tis for
lack o’ such commonsinse me ship’s been
tuk, an’ me a pris’ner this night.”
“Don’t mind about that,” Mr. Wicks re-
assured him. "You’ll be all right, Captain.
I can tell ’em how you behaved reasoixably,
and I don’t suppose the Governor will do
much more than fine you a trifle, and let
you go. Of course, you’ll get the rough side
of his tongue—but we’re at peace with the
United States, and, after all, you haven’t
actually assisted any prisoners to escape,
whatever you might have been going to do.
Don’t worry.”
“Faith, thin, sorr, ’tis not Dan Costello’s
tlx’ wan for to worry. I’ll take another drop
o’ this grog for to prove it to ye—an’ mebbe
ye’d be afther sayin’ y’r own good resolution
what ye’re makin’ for th’ New Year.. ’Twill
be a foine oixe entoircly, I’ll go bail.”
Mr. Wicks ladled his prisoner out a fur-
ther liberal portion of the rum punch, frown-
ing a little in the effort of serious thought,
as he considered the amending of his ways.
He smiled, as he turned his eyes on Mr.
Pilkington.
“Look here, Brummell, old boy—l feel so
d—d perfect myself that I hardly seem to
realise any direction in which improvement
might be made. Maybe, though, you might
have noticed something? What d’ye think
I ought to make up my mind to do —or not
to do—in the coming twelve months? And
what about Patrick? You might”
Again the booming voice of the bos’n inter-
rupted the resolutionists. His announce-
meixt had a disastrous effect upon Mr. Wicks.
“Tli’ schooner, y’r honor,” bellowed Bill
Miller. “She’s done a bunk. Upped stick
and away. Cleared for furrin parts.”
“Hell, and suffering devils!” howled the
acting-commander of H.M.S. Emu. “What
the blazes has happened, Bill? Out with it,
your eyes, out with it !”
“If ye plaize, sir, them Yankees, or Chinks
—or whatever they is—they’ve been treatin’
th’ guard Mr. Bullivant left aboard, and got
’em as drunk as fiddlers, every one of ’em.
An’ put ’em over the side. They’ve just got
back-^—as pretty lookin’ a boat’s crew as ever
I’ve seed. An’ th’ schooner’s up-anchored
and away. This here gent.’s in it, too, sir.
A plot—that’s what it is, y’r honor.”
Mr. Wicks wheeled furiously round to face
the smiling Captain Costello. “What does
this mean, sir?”
The li'ishman was ixot abashed. He laughed
gently.
“Well, thin, me friend, ’twould be idleixess
for to play tlx’ game further. I am not the
captain of the schponer—that was your Mr.
Bullivant’s error. Maybe - the lad was a little
young for such work. Driscoll and Rourkc
were to be met outside Broken Bay this
evening. I’ve no doxxbt that anyone on top of
the headland might even now observe the
flare they will be burning in the ketch that
brought them down the river this afternoon.
’Tis no use taking your ship to sea after the
schooner—she’s the fastest thing was ever
launched in New England, and could sail
round and round yoxxr brig. ’Twould be
futile, sir—quite hopelessly fxxtile.”
“And you, sir—who the devil are you?”
“Oh me, sorr —I’m a United Irishman, and
what I’m doing is the work that was assigned
to me in New York. I’m here to xindergo
any consequences that may be coming as a
result of this little effort.”
“Miller, put this man in irons. You’ll pay
for this, sir—when Governor Macquarie gets
to hear of it.”
“Thank you, sorr, I’ve not a doubt of it.
But lam an American subject, sir. I’d like
you to remember that—in case of trouble.”
“H —n your eyes, sir! Take him away,
bos’n. Shove him in the fore-peak. I’ll”
Eight bells struck on the quarter-deck. Mr.
Pilkington checked his fiuend’s blasphemies
and profanities with uplifted hand.
“The New Year, Panthy, my boy. Pway
wewember your good wetholution. Pway”
J. H. M. ABBOTT.
The Pot.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FROM where Mrs. Hanley sat, in the
patch of sunlight behind her half-drawn
window curtains, she could see up and
down the short length of the narrow, asphal-
ted lane known as Mufking-street.
For eight years she had lived alone in this
tiny, old-fashioned cottage nestling timidly
between the tall brick factories on either
side. Her late husband had left her the
dingy little home and sufficient money to
keep her from want and the old-age pension.
She was very old now, nearly seventy, and
her chief diversion was watching the ebb and
flow of life around her, the children playing
in the gutters of Murking-street, the workers
homeward bound at dusk, the drunks and the
harlots beneath the wide awnings of the
corner pub.
Eight years is a long time to live alone—
a long time.
She knew that she was considered a child-
ish old crone; a woman who had never known
motherhood or mother-love. Only she could
have told her neighbors they were wrong.
The years of loneliness had brought back
to her anile mind, startlingly clear, recollec-
tions of a part of her life she had tried to
forget. Memories haunted her: memories of
a mad night beneath a country moon; of a
girl fleeing to the sheltering impersonality of
the city; of a sleeping baby boy, club-footed
and disfigured by a crescent-shaped birthmark
on the left side" of his face, placed at dawn
on the doormat of a charity home.
Fifty years had rolled away since that
'dawn in the long ago. During that time she
had met, and married, Torn Hanley, and
kept house for him, a quiet, staid and re-
spected wife, until the day he died.
Now, fruit of her lonely life, heartaches
and yearnings came to torment her. She
wanted her boy now, wanted him with a
fierce and hungry love made doubly strong
by the impossibility of indulgence. And
fifty years had swallowed him up, hiding
from her even the name the authorities of
the long-since-defunct home had given him.
From the kitchen came the rattle of a
saucepan lid. The sound brought her
abruptly back to reality. She shuffled into
the room and lifted the lid from the pot of
stew on the gas-stove. For a minute she
watched the bubbling mess.
A stew! That was Life. Love and hate,
laughter and tears, birth and death, all
boiled up together, the component parts ris-
ing and falling, seething and simmering, in
a mad race round and round, up and down,
within the pot.
She laughed, a shrill cackle of cynical
mirth. 'Would the boil of the pot ever throw
mother and son together again ?
Rather shakily she turned down the gas,
and returned to her rocking-chair behind the
window curtains. The children were still
playing on the opposite side of the street,
in the shade of a sickly kurrajong, which
fought for life in the alien, smoke-burthened
air. A man hobbled from the house three
doors down the street, a battered fibre suit-
case in his hand. He entered the verandah
of the house next towards her own, coming
out a few minutes later with a look of hope-
less disappointment on his weak face.
She clutched at her withered breasts. The
hawker was club-footed, and even from where
she sat she could see that his face was dis-
figured by a red crescent-shaped blotch. He
came hobbling past the factory on her right,
walking with the aid of a stick.
Mrs. Hanley stared with wide, incredulous
eyes. He was closer now, near enough for
her to note the puffed and unhealthy skin,
the sagging mouth, the watery blue eyes.
She knew the signs well. Twenty-five years
of life on the city boundary had given to her
an instinctive connoisseursliip in appear-
ances.
She had no doubt as to his identity. It
was impossible that two children should be
born with the distinguishing disfigurements
he carried. He passed her window and
shuffled on to the narrow strip of tiled veran-
dah. She heard the iron gate which barred
it off from the street clang behind him; then
the rataplan of the knocker thundered
through tne silent house.
Her mind was a-seethe, and again there
flashed upon her that comparison of the pot,
a stew of human emotions boiling madly on
some cosmic fire. Before her son’s advent
the issue had seemed clear and unclouded:
now other confusing considerations bubbled
up to fight her long cherished desire.
How could she explain his presence to the
neighbors, unless she owned to the shame
and agony of that furtive birth of fifty years
ago? She winced at the thought of their
knowing smiles and sly winks.
The knocker fell again, and she rose and
shuffled to the door.
“Can I sell y’ somethin’, missus? Pins,
soap, bootlaces, studs?”
He became conscious of the intentness of
her look and gave her back a curious stare.
Mrs. Hanley started. “Yes. Yes. A cake
of soap, please,” she said quickly.
He stooped to pick out the article, and her
hungry eyes ran from his disreputable clothes
to his malformed foot. A great longing
surged over her, and she half-raised her hands
towards him.
Then he stood erect with the soap out-
stretched towards her. and her eyes became
riveted on his flushed and puffy skin and
the blotchy crescent running from ear to
throat. She shuddered with distaste and took
a quick step away.
She knew suddenly, with horrible finality,
that it was not in her to acknowledge this
poor, deformed bit of human flotsam.
The man caught her glance and flushed
angrily.
“A shillin’, missus,” he said sharply.
She passed it to him with a hand she tried
in vain to keep, steady.
He took it with a muttered word of thanks,
and shuffled off, his club foot and stick clop-
clopping on the path.
Mrs. Hanley shut her front door quickly,
trying to bar from her ears the childish voices
from the other side of the street.

is just thrift. The farmer conserves fodder in the good years against the season
of drought or flood, and by his preparedness for such times his progress may
largely be estimated.
Thrift does not meian the mere hoarding of anything, but the wise use of
such material, whether it be foodstuff, money or other material.
The conservation of money is a necessity in all walks of life, and the Savings
account a simple, easy method of effecting it.
To the wise spending, the use of the facilities offered by a modern Bank will
contribute very largely.

Dolls for children are practically unknown
these days in London, Pans and on the
French Riviera. But for grown people with
the. brains of children dolls —or fetiches, as
they are now generally called —-are fashion-
able. No gay bachelor or smart woman is
now without one or more —generally more
of these toys for the lounge, the boudoir or
the automobile. They take all forms, from
hideous malformity to representations ot his-
toric personages or phases of national dress,
carried out in such elaboration as to run into
large sums of money.

The enormous increase in the number of
dogs kept by all classes in England and
France, and the quality and quantity of food
consumed by these canine gourmands, have
lately been indicated as a very solid reason
for a considerable part of the advance in
prices. In some cities the number of dogs
at large has become a nuisance. The foot-
paths are always in a state of filth; yapping
mongrels impede one’s footsteps on all sides;
and the barking at night has led to police
intervention. In London alone there are
150,000 more dogs than before the war; and
in the Isle of Wight, as lately officially indi-
cated, there are more dogs than children.
This cult of the dog has reached a ridiculous
extreme. Both in the English and French
capitals it is quite a common sight to see
stalwart men, as well as ancient ladies, driv-
ing or walking with grotesque little mon-
strosities called dogs, which are so feeble,
so mis-shapen in their absurd trappings, so
unsightly from their artificial life, as to be
positively nauseating.

A long time ago somebody innocently sug-
gested that a super-peal of bells —in short, a
carillon —should be the University’s mem-
orial to its dead sons in the Great War.
Sydney took to the idea. A carillon would
sweep out in triumphant harmony over the
city and drop balm on its old sores. And
then some little god of irony chuckled at the.
thought of the unholy joy he could get by
causing friction between the greybeards who
had the project in hand. The carillon was
ordered. Everybody smiled. It was a beau-
tiful carillon. It had an amazing number of
peals. Everybody was charmed. Where
shall we house it? “In the tower, for the
present,” said some, including the Senate of
the Uni. “Nonsense! Such a grand caril-
lon must be stowed in a tall, slim campanile,”
said a great number of carillon enthusiasts.
“Cost £60,000,” snapped the Towerists, “and
there’s a perfectly good tower that’s practi-
cally a lumber room.” The campanile back-
ers formed themselves into a committee, and
started a fund, and had a lunch at the Aus-
tralia (not out of the funds, but that will
show you they are men of affairs) and en-
gaged an organiser. Then the things which
the Towerists and the Campanilists had been
merely thinking about one another they
started to write to the papers. Now there’s
no Campanile Fund at all. It was busted
up, and the money returned, and men like
knight George Fuller and ex-Ohief Justice
Cullen, who is Chancellor of the Uni., and
Knight Mungo MacCallum, who is its Vice-
Chancellor and a small, determined Scot,
are doing a large laundry-job in public. The
little god of irony has spoiled the grand har-
mony of that carillon for many people.

“C.Q.” : It is a curious fact that, although
Victorians generally are credited with a fairly
constant devotion to soap and water, no
factory for the manufacture of cotton towels
has hitherto graced the State. A Melbourne
firm, H. B. Dickie and Co., is building a mill
at Yarraville and proposes to supply the lack.
Inside six months there will be 75 looms, and
30 skilled weavers from the Cold Land have
arrived to form the nucleus of an industry.
The raw material still has to journey to
England and return as yarn, but when Aus-
tralian yarn of the right absorbency is avail-
able, it is to be used.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: A Vic. motor firm hit on a bright
idea for marketing its flivvers. It enlisted
25 ’Varsity students during the late vacation,
paying them a weekly salary and commission.
They called on 55,560 householders, and
recorded 4411 actual and prospective buyers.
* * * *
“Penfield”: I had a train to myself the
other day, with two men on the engine, a
third to flap the flag and a fourth to collect
my ticket. And it wasn’t on a country line
either: it was between Adelaide and its chief
bathing-place, Glenelg. Fifty years ago some
people built a private railway to Glenelg, and
a little later some asses built a second line
that ran abreast of the other. The older
co. soon swallowed the younger, and when
the State decided that it must taken over the
Glenelg line it had to take over the Holdfast
Bay ditto as well. Perhaps that wouldn’t
have mattered much if the two lines hadn’t
struck the city at its opposite and remotest
ends; so that when the motor-’buses started
to carry their passengers into the city they
got practically all the traffic. In despera-
tion Railway Commissioner Webb slapped
on ’buses, too; and now, except for less
than an hour morning and evening, when
the ’buses can’t carry the peak traffic, Webb,
railway man, looks out from his empty car-
riages to see Webb, ’bus proprietor, compet-
ing furiously with private lines for the road
traffic. And the citizen remarks gloomily
that it cost him over £lOO,OOO last year, and
he’s darned if he knows what to do about it.
* * * *
“Centurion”: An unpleasant indication of
the evil influence that starting-price betting
exercises appeared in a recent police-court
case at Inverell (N.S.W.). Two telegraph
operators who worked on alternate Satur-
day afternoons when the racing wires were
coming through were convicted and fined £5
each for divulging the contents of telegrams
to unauthorised persons. These persons
were two bookmakers, who were convicted
for aiding and abetting the operators, and
fined £2O each on each charge—£Bo in all.
The two operators have been suspended, and
no doubt will be dismissed in the usual
course of things, but beyond a fine which
they are hardly likely to feel seriously, the
two “books,” who admittedly bribed the un-
happy operators to break their oath of
secrecy, go scot-free. There has been more
than one case of the sort within the last
12 mouths, and in every case the result has
been much the same—the official has been
unci thrown out of his job, while the
guiltier party, after a fine, has been left
free to continue his dubious occupation, and
hunt up fresh operators to corrupt.

“Lagani-Namo”: “Sucre” (B. 27/l/'27)
notwithstanding, sisal-hemp cultivation in
Queensland is out of the question owing to
high labor costs. An expert cutter can't cut
more than 1200 leaves a day, and it takes
40,000 leaves to produce a ton of fibre, which
ts worth, say, £43 in Sydney. Unless
“Sucre” can get the land cleared, planted and
maintained for nothing, and devise a miracu-
lous method of conveying the stuff to the mill,
to say nothing of baling it and transporting
if and marketing it, he will crash if h e takes
the hemp game on.

“P.X.” : Somebody made a bad mess of the
Broken Hill railway job. Two months ago
it was possible to get to the Darling from
Sydney, and to the opposite bank of it
from Broken Hill; but it will be six months
before the connecting bridge will be usable.
Of course, nobody takes the blame. Appa-
rently somebody who didn’t know told some-
body who didn’t care that the Darling was
a dry ditch in a desert, and the bridge was
planned accordingly. For months past
reports have been circulated that the “excep-
tional state” of the river has caused delay,
whereas actually there has been nothing
exceptional about the river at all. It refused
to be a ditch, and it declined to dry up. The
one thing certain is that the plans, both of
the bridge and of the manner of building
it, will have to be radically altered; and the
only scrap of consolation is that the longer
the opening is delayed the less the Trea-
sury will suffer, because the line isn’t at all
likely to pay working expenses.
* * * *
“Willyama”: The threatened opening of
the Sydney-Broken Hill railway—you can
send goods now, but you have to ferry them
over the Darling—sent Tooth’s, of Sydney,
turning up its atlas to find out where the
Great Barrier thirst is located. The big
brewing cos. of the States have a gentle-
man’s agreement not to poach with their
bottled goods on one another’s territory; but
the Sydney hop-merchants have not hitherto
troubled about Broken Hill, and the S.A.
Brewing Co. has had the run of it. Now,
however, the Sydney people want their own,
and Tooth’s general manager and sales man-
ager and architect have been exploring the
town. It is quite a friendly business —the
S.A. co.’s manager went with them, and it
looks as though Tooth’s will relieve the Adel-
aide people of some of their dusty invest-
ments. They evidently saw a cloud gather-
ing in the sky, for they closed their old-
established local brewery last year.
* * * *
“Avon” : Maoriland cow-cockies have been
a little excited recently over a letter from
an association of exporters in America sug-
gesting that there is a good market for their
cheese in the U.S.A. Local experts say that
the American demand is for cheeses of
tvpes that the Fernlanders can’t supply, but
that’s all bunkum. Tons of Maoriland cheese
have entered America in recent years, pur-
chased from London dealers, but of course
it isn’t retailed as such. It goes into the
highly-colored wrappers of cheese purveyors
who draw their supplies from all over the
world.
» * * *
“Bouragi”: The impetus given to Papua’s
half-strangled trade by the lifting of the
Navigation Act restrictions is seen in the
figures printed in the Territory’s latest
annual report. Total trade exports and im-
ports passed the £1,000,000-mark for the
first time in Papua’s history, exports exceed-
ing imports. The improvement in _ the rub-
ber market has helped the prosperity-even
the government plantations have turned out
a financial success, two of them showing a
profit of £BOOO.

“Two Seas” : Mysterious are the methods
of the N.S.W, Railway Department A man
trucked fat sheep at Marulan for Homebush.
The jumbucks were sent to Goulburn, -0
miles further south, and then back again to
their destination; it was explained that they
got to Homebush quicker by travelling the
extra 40 miles. Another sheepman who
wanted to put sheep into trucks at another
station for delivery at Homebush was told
there were no trucks available. \yhat
about those trucks over there ?” he inquired,
pointing to a lot of empties on the sunns;.
“Can’t have them; they have to go back
to Sydney.” was the reply. So the disgusted
owner had to wait until those empty trucks
went to Sydney and back so that the law
of red tape might be strictly observed.
* * * #
“X.D.” : A housebreaker, apparently in a
fair way of business, made a curious aduus-
sion in a Melbourne court the other day. He
said that he did not remember what places
he had burgled the night before until he
read the notices in the papers next day.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
“Short of a gallop” must have been Cave
Dweller’s complaint when he faded out in
the Renown Handicap at Rosehill on Satur-
day week. lie made every post a winner
in the first division of the Railway Handicap
at the same course on Saturday, and nothing
could pace it with him over the final stretch
of seven furlongs, run in lmin. 25fsec. Two
lengths behind the Peter the Hermit gelding
came Lausanne, who also improved greatly
on his previous exhibition, and Don Mooii.
finishing well, was another two lengths away,
with Bunting Wallace, Boaster, Waranton
and Hemisphere next. Boaster, whose show-
ing did not impress, was favorite at 7 to
2; Waranton and Plemisphere were quoted
at 6 to 1, Cave Dweller, Lausanne and Don
Moon at 7 to 1 and Bunting Wallace at 10
to 1. It was Cave Dweller’s fifth win in six
starts, and he seems to hold those he defeated
safe in the Doncaster, wherein the consistent
fellow will have 21b. off his back —he carried
Sst. 41b. in the Railway.
There were numerous withdrawals from
the second division, among them Grecian
Orator, whose poor track performances have
been puzzling the touts; and Fuji San (2
to 1) disposed of his seven opponents in
fine style. Bounding to the front as soon as
Pike gave him his head, the big fellow won
just as easily as Cave Dweller in the same
time, the weight (lOst. 41b., 71b. more than
in the Doncaster) troubling him not at all.
Wedding Eve (7 to 1) was second, nearly
three lengths away; the unlucky Highland
(9 to 2) was another length astern; and
then came Preposterer (5 to 1), whose exhi-
bition was anything but brilliant. On this
form Fuji San has a decided Doncaster
chance, and Wedding Eve, who is still a
bit backward in condition, is pretty certain
to improve.
“I’ll take six to four” was the cry of
McShortodds when betting opened on the
Rawson Stakes, and there was so much Vali-
care money in sight that presently it was
7 to 4 on. But all four starters had good
support, and at the close it was 5 to 4 on
Valicare, 9 to 2 Limerick, 5 to 1 Amounis
and 6 to 1 Windbag, about whom 10’s had
been offered in places. Looking them over
before the race, this Page was impressed with
Limerick’s condition, which was almost per-
fect, whereas Valicare seemed a trifle soft,
Windbag on the burly side and Amounis far
from fit. Condition proved the deciding fac-
tor, for after the bonny bay mare had set up
her usual long lead, being five lengths ahead
of Limerick and Amounis at the four-furlong
post, with Windbag 10 lengths in the rear,
Limerick left Amounis and went after the
leader, who was done with at the Leger.
Already thrilled by Valicare’s failure, which
w r as palpable at the entrance to the straight,
the crowd was roused to more enthusiasm by
seeing Munro get to work on Windbag with
great effect. The champion’s grand run took
him past Amounis and Valicare, but McCar-
ten hadn’t to ride Limerick out to get him
home with an advantage of three-quarters of
a length, Valicare beating Amounis by a
couple of lengths. Limerick left the nine
furlongs behind in lmin. 51jsoc. He imme-
diately became favorite for the Sydney Cup,
in which he has Sst. 41b.
It came on to rain at this stage and the
rest of the afternoon was very damp and
disagreeable. The Magpie filly Black Duchess
(6 to 1) did well to win the first division
of the Nursery Handicap after Prime Don
(9 to 2), a Sarcliedon colt, had seemed to
have her measure; and The Wensum (8
to 1), by carrying 9st. 21b. to victory in the
second division, defeating Glenariff among
others, suggested that Melbourne two-year-
old form is better than Sydney’s. With Vaals

scratched for the Tliree-and-Four-Year-Old
Handicap because of the now sloppy going,
Manacre (3 to 1) was the elect of backers,
but the Vic. horse steered an erratic course
and was downed by the useful 'Reonui (5
to 1), who would perhaps have been too
good for him anyhow. In the second division
of this race the well-bred Golden Curio (10
to 1) showed a fine turn of speed at the
right end, and the owner of Calmest (9 to 2)
had to put up with another second. Calmest,
who was burdened with lOst. lib., has had
nearly 40 races in 18 months, but apparently
she will be kept going until she drops dead.
Luddenham, who looks like a carthorse
and has been a sore, trial to his trainers,
condescended to do his best in the Autumn
Handicap, 12 furlongs, for which he was
favorite at 3 to 1. and he got there at last.
Thereby he completed a double for R. W.
Mackinnon, the Kogarali trainer, who has
Cave Dweller in his stable, and for Simpson,
one of the rising hopes of N.S.W. jockeydom,
who rode both. Johnnie Jones (12 to 1)
was a good second to Luddenham, whose
time was 2min. 34sec., nor did Spaghetti
(14 to 1) disgrace himself; but Octember,
Vitality and Murillo cut up badly. Two
other Sydney Cup candidates in Piastoon
(3 to 1) and Battlement (S to 1) earned
prize money for their owners in the Parra-
matta Mile, Piastoon (Pike) and North
Logan (Munro) dead-heating for first place
after a struggle in which two good riders
put forth their utmost skill. Piastoon is
back to his best Queensland form, and should
be worth following the next few weeks.

The A.J.C. meeting at Warwick Farm on
Saturday will be a curtain-raiser to the great
Easter round at Randwick, and if the
weather keeps fine a great crowd will visit
the pretty course. The principal events of
an uncommonly interesting programme are
briefly dissected hereunder: —
Chipping Norton Stakes, w.f.a. with penal-
ties and allowances, a mile and a quarter.
Windbag (9st. 91b.), Valicare, Limerick and
Amounis are engaged, each with 71b. more
than they had at Rosehill; Pantheon, Spear-
felt and Thracian are also in the list of
nominations. Windbag ought to win on
Saturday’s run; the additional 71b. will be
more of a handicap to Limerick than to any
of the others, and the sharp Warwick Farm
turns may not suit the youngster—they
didn’t when Rampion beat him there in Sep-
tember. Should there be six starters Vali-
care may be worth a tote bet; perhaps the
best wasn’t seen of her at Rosehill, and she
ran a pretty good mile and a quarter in
the A.J.C. Craven Plate.
Liverpool Handicap, six furlongs, with
Fuji San (lOst. 71b.) as topweiglit. Kelso
has a strong hand with Bairn (9st. 71b.),
Boaster (9st. 31b.) and Persuasion (Sst.
Sib.), the last-named especially; but this
Page will stick to Vaals (9st. lib.). Golden
Curio (7st. 61b.) is a lightweight with a
chance.
Fairfield Handicap, six furlongs, for two-
year-olds. The Wensum and Euston have
9st. 51b., Beckwith 9st. 21b., Greenline 9st.
lib., Ascalon 9st., Glenariff and Chromium
Sst. 111 b.. Black Duchess and Welina Sst. 91b.,
Sion Sst., Greenwich 7st. 131 b., Greensil
7st. 121 b., Prime Don and 1.0. U. 7st. 111 b.
These should provide a pretty race which
may be best left alone. Possibly Black
Duchess will be prominent again—a good
game filly this.
Warwick Farm Cup, a mile and a half,
with Pantheon (9st. 131 b.) in pride of place.
Here also Kelso commands attention with
Bacchus (Sst. 21b.) and Piastoon (Sst:.).
The course may not suit Bacchus or Nans
(also Sst. 21b.), who are both slow to get
going, but it should suit Piastoon down to
the ground. With a start, he ought to be
about the best tote bet of the day. Tibbie
looked pretty well at Rosehill and has a
handy weight (7st. 51b.) ; failing Piastoon,
she may succeed. Others in the picture are
Luddenham (7st.) and Firefly (6st. 101 b.).
Cabramatta Handicap, a mile. Waranton
heads the list with list. 31b.; there is a 7st.
71b. minimum. Buchanan (Sst. 41b.), who
did not start at Rosehill, may win one of the
divisions (there will probably be three), and
Pigeon Pie (Sst. lib.) should not be dis-
carded —he runs his best races at the Farm.
Other candidates who have shaped well on
this track and are not badly treated are
Hemisphere (9st. Cdb.), Cajole (Sst. 121 b.)
and Chris (Sst. 71b.).

Three favorites were among the winners
at Epsom (Vic.) on Saturday, and the
others were well backed, but the ringmen
protected themselves by cramping the prices.
They are enabled to do this in Victoria by
the absence of the tote; hence the aggres-
sive affluence of the tribe. The public picked
Red Shank (7 to 4), who has the 1925 Oaks
to her credit, as a good thing for the April
Handicap, 10 furlongs, but the Thrice mare
had no chance with T. M. Burke’s Bombard,
which Spearhead—Sabulite gelding beat her
in hollow fashion by three lengths, Lady
Ivingsburgh (11 to 2) being a close third.
Bombard, who has won over hurdles, is a
useful sort; he is trained for Burke by T.
•T. Hayes, and Scanlon rode him. The Epsom
Plate, six furlongs, was taken in good style
by that smart horse Threeasta (6 to 1), who
is a tough proposition in suburban company;
Flying Corn (9 to 2) was second and Coogee
Bay (2 to 1) third. Coogee Bay had a
very rough passage, and should repay his
followers before long.
There was a £lOOO handicap at Moonee
Valley (Vic.) on Monday, it being Eight
Hours Day. Tookarby, who was an even-
money favorite, gave his supporters a thrill
or two, as he was second last for a time, bur.
moving up smartly, he challenged Duckshot
(20 to 1), who had led nearly all the way,
and won brilliantly by a length and a half
from the Bucklaw gelding, with Longworthy
(10 to 1) half a length away, and Cyanate
(an early winner) a good fourth. Tookarby,
who had 9st. and was ridden bv Ashley Recti,
covered the 12 furlongs in 2min. 315 see., a
course record. He is still in the Sydney Cup,
in which he has Sst. 21b., but may stay in
Melbourne for the King’s Cup at Flemington,
as the two-mile journey has hitherto boon
a little too far for him.
Adelaide’s Amateur Turf Club served up a
novelty at Cheltenham on Saturday in _ the
shape of a triple dead-heat. It occurred in a
mile Welter, the horses being Glucose, Amber-
oid and Cadelgo. The last-named, a hardy
old Kenilworth gelding, won the run-off.
“Nakhoda”: It isn’t only theatre pro-
prietors who are feeling the pinch of wireless.
Several suburban racecourses round Mel-
bourne are recording lower attendances than
in previous years, and in Victoria the broad-
casting of descriptions of races is very
thorough. ,T. L. Reilly, the Epsom club
secretary, met four persons in one day who
said that they were going to stay at home
and listen-in. Melbourne clubs are so wor-
ried about it that some of them are talking
of discontinuing broadcasting.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
The 15-rounder at the ■ Sydney Stadium
on Saturday night brought to mind the
ancient refrain, “Darktown racecourse nine
miles long. Doodah!” Two coons occupied
the ring and used up a vast amount of space
in their efforts to avoid colliding with a
punch. The two were Tenario Pelkey,
American citizen of Manila (lOst. 3Mb.),
and .Toe Hall, U.S. negro (9st. 1341 b.). So
careful were the pair during the first five
rounds that the small, damp, dejected crowd
hooted and counted them out till the referee
had to prance in and warn them to fight or
b e outed. This had some effect; the affair
became more like a fight and less like a six-
days’ go-as-you-please. Pelkey pushed Hall s
face more often than Joe slapped Tenario s
lunch-bag, and got the verdict at the end of
the lugubrious journey; his second win out
of three contests with the little Kiwi chap.
“Snowy” Baker, who is still a shareholder
in the enterprise he managed for years, is
consigning another coon —Charlie Long, a
California middleweight—to Stadiums, Ltd.
It is not clear whether the new bird is com-
ing alone or as one of a crate, but it is a
million sterling to a monkey-nut that those
whose business it is to defend the White
Australia policy will enter no caveat. They
don’t seem to care how many of these
colored bruisers come or how long they stay.
The much-talked-of match between Bert
McCarthy (9st. 1341 b.) and Billy Samuels
(9st. 181 b.) at Melbourne was a complete
washout. The abo. landed a low right in
the first round, and before the big crowd
had awakened to what was happening, the

“DAFFERDH.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The wild-eyed stranger took my hand and
asked if I’d imbibe.
As I obliged, a singer rose—one of the tap-
room tribe.
Of love that strayed, or got mislaid, he sang
most dolefully;
And as he sang the stranger turned and
whispered thus to me:
"I ve got no time fer barmy coots who wail
of some lost love
With ‘golding ’air, an’ beauty rare, an’ eyes
like stars above.’
I d like to pulverise the cow that starts such
warblin’ ’ere—
It brings back mournful memories that spoil
the taste o’ beer!
“Each one of us 'as ‘mighterbeens’ that mock
us now an’ then,
Remembrances of other days w’en we was
diff’rent men—
To-night, ole man, since ’e began that
melerdy to spill
J/i/ thoughts ’ave started slewin’ back to
my lost Dafferdil.
"She lies beside a slie-oak clump ’way out
near Quartpot town.”
Sniffing romance, I asked if he could keep
another down.
To his lost love I raised my glass, and
he returned, “Here’s how!”
Then paused to add he felt inclined to
“spiflicate that cow!”
But when I spoke of “Dafferdil" his face
grew sad again.
"Ah, mate,” he sighed, “you’ve no ideer 'ow
I ’ave changed since then.
The plans I made is up the pole, my castle’s
on the floor;
I re done me Daff. —oh, spare me days. Vs
goin’ ter sing some more!—
“ Ei' big brown eyes, I see them now —
to-night they’re hauntin’ me!
Affection an’ intellergence— that fits ’em to
a T!
If she 'ad lived, I tell yer straight. I'd be
a diff’rent chap ;
She broke ’er neck, poor blighter, in the
Quartpot Handicap !
"A dark bay mare, stood sixteen ’ands”—-
Just there I said good-night.
But as I left I caught the sounds of blas-
phemy and fight.
My wild-eyed friend I knew had tried the
singer’s gore to spill—
Because his mournful songs inspired sad
thoughts of “Dafferdil” !

“C.C.E.”: Veteran pug. Joe Stokesbury
was third man in the ring when a lady-
like exhibition was inflicted on a howling
crowd at Richmond (Vic.). After enduring 11
rounds (there were to have been 15) Joe
climbed through the ropes. “I referee no
more,” he said laconically. “It’s crook. If
these boys call this boxing, then I’m a
goat.” And Joseph left.

“The Gaffer”: When Billy Edwards, Aus-
tralia’s middleweight champion (save the
mark!), was disqualified in the seventh round
i,f his fight at Brisbane with challenger
Hughio DAvyer, the. audience punctuated its
vocal disapproval with bottles hurled at the
"ref.” Ringsiders enjoyed a good imitation
of a shrapnel barrage while the glass was
flying, but no casualties were reported. This
surt of thing is not unknown in Brisbane,
for when M ax Gornik, now in South Africa,
fought Billy Shade a full bottle was chucked
over the ropes—in spite of the heroic efforts
of would-be rescuers, it was broken, to the
grief of all present. Dwyer was ahead on
points when the illegal blow landed and cost
Edwards his title.
“Shamrock” : Tom Heeney, the Maoriland
heavyweight, who couldn’t get matches at
the Stadium when in Sydney, there being
too many coons clamoring for dates, or some-
thing of the sort, has gone a long way since
and must have made a pile of money. A
heavy hitter and strong as a bull, Tom had
faith in himself, so he went to England and
the Continent, where he has beaten more
than have beaten him. Not long ago
he crossed the Atlantic, and the cable in-
forms us that on Friday night, at Madison
Square Garden, New York, he met the
Spanish giant, Paolino, Avho has been mak-
ing a big splash in Yankeeland. Heeney
knocked corners off the hidalgo for the first
three rounds, and looked a sure winner. But
the Don’s toughness told, and he received
the referee’s decision at the end of the bout,
which is described as one of the liveliest
ever seen at the Garden. Paolino is to be
matched with Tunney.
Racquet and Bawl
“15-30”: The prospects of Australia re-
gaining the Davis Cup within the next few
years grow dimmer as one contemplates the
current scene. Patterson and Hawkes are
the only two on the continent capable of
launching a vigorous assault on the Ameri-
can citadel, and as both are now men of
affairs with substantial business interests
whisking them frequently away from prac-
tice Ave cannot count on their racquets for
very much longer. And who is to replace
them when they settle doAvn ultimately, as
seems probable, to golf and wireless? There
is not a colt in sight who promises to possess
the necessary international equipment. I
have looked them all over and I can only see
in the deceptive languor and shrewd con-
cealment of direction shown by young Jack
Crawford, of N.S.W., the nucleus of a win-
ning game. But Crawford lacks pace, especi-
ally in his service, and I behold no evi-
dence of his cultivating this essential for
the surprise of his competitors. In fact,
everywhere I see the service neglected for
the development of the drive —a good enough
objective for beginners, but no sort of rule
for the man who is mo\ T ing up from A grade
pennant to inter-State rank. Yet the service
ought to be a player’s besetting vice, a
thing of violence and kick, spin and SAverve,
so delivered that it will enable a player to
amass a demoralising quantity of outright
points. No one can estimate the effect of
a powerful penetrating service. Patterson’s
3-sets-to-love defeat of Lacoste in America
two or three years ago is a case in point.
Lacoste is Patterson’s superior in ground
play; his stroke production is almost fault-
less; yet, under the hail of unplayable aces
—I think the Australian served the world’s
record of 16 during the match—the Gaul
crumpled up.

“Tennis Lyre”: How these court ladies
love one another! Suzanne Lenglen
recently announced that Helen Wills was
in-owing too fat to play tennis and would
have to take on some less exacting game.
Helen retorted that Suzanne w-as evidently
nettled at the report that she, Helen, was
about to publish a book of poems, whereas
Suzanne’s only essay in literature, apart
from a laborious book of tennis reminis-
cences, was an alleged novel. The implica-
tion is that Helen can lick Suzanne at either
sets or sonnets, when she gets fit again.
-Most people, one imagines, would prefer
watching their play to reading their books.
* * * *
“Bouragi” : The International Lawn Ten-
nis Federation, which had a conference
recently in Paris, gave a lot of attention to
the question of professionalism, and decided
that members of the Federation be left to
deal with the matter in their own territory
as each thought fit. South Africa, down on
professionalism in every branch of sport, was
all for barring the practice, but was out-
voted. This deliberate dodging of the
amateur-status question seems a grave error.
As it is, every country has its own ideas
on the subject, with the result that one sees
the “crimes of Clapham chaste at Marta-
ban,” as it were, and confusion becoming
worse confounded every week.
Australians for Amsterdam
People who remember how well Austra-
lians did, in adverse circumstances, at the
last Olympic Games and who are keen on
our representatives doing even better at the
next are wondering when the responsible
authorities are going to get a move on. There
is only a trifle over a year to go before the
big show opens at Amsterdam. In between
lies a long programme of selection and elimi-
nation work, to say nothing of the vastly
important matters of collecting funds and
of making arrangements for transporting,
housing and training the athletes. Britain,
America and nearly every other competitor
have long since completed these prelimin-
aries. Only the Federal Olympic Council
and the State committees which are sup-
posed to rouse the sleeping gods at the proper
time show no signs of moving.
There is an impression abroad that the
material available is not particularly good.
The truth is that this country has rarely
had such a choice of potential Olympic win-
ners as at present. Andrew Charlton, in
a class by himself as a swimmer at 440
yards, 880 yards and a mile, will probably
be available. Jones, of Westralia. is another
fine performer over a distance; and Grier, of
Queensland, is a good 220 man. These three,
with Doyle, Henry or Moore (N.S.W.),
would be very hard to beat in the team race.
Then Edna Davey, with her sensational wins
in the 150, 220, 300 and 880 yards N.S.W.
championships, and the 220 and 440 Aus-
tralian championships, is bidding fair to
eclipse the famous Fanny Durack. In the
300 yards State championship she put up
the world’s-record time of 3min. 54 4-ssec.;
the American, Gertrude Ederle, held the
previous record with 3min. 58 2-ssec., Fanny
Du rack’s best Australian figures being 4min.
2 l-ssec. Another girl with fine credentials
is 17-year-old Doris Thompson, of Queens-
land, who Avon the Australian 220 yards
breaststroke championship at Brisbane in
the world’s-record time of 3min. 27 2-ssec.
Add to that category Dick Eve, Olympic
champion at plain high diving—there is a
chance of his being reinstated as an amateur
—and we would have a more than useful
lot of swimmers.
Another Olympic champion is A. W. Win-
ter, of New South Wales; still our best at
the hop, step and jump, he may still be
the world’s best. Much, too, is hoped from
J. Carlton, who has clocked evens as a
schoolboy champion sprinter, and after a
spell, through illness, captured the State
100 on a heavy track in 10 l-ssoc. In Vic-
“A fellow just told me I look like you!”
“Where is he? I’ll knock his block off!”
“I’ve knocked it off.”
toria, Wilson, of the Ivanhoe club, recently
won the 440 hurdles championship of his
State in 54 9-10 sec., only a fraction worse
than the world’s record ; while G. R. Hyde,
the Australian one-mile and three-miles
champion, is another outstanding Cabbage
Gardener. L. C. Parker, of Queensland, who
last year won the Australasian 100 in D
4-ssec., may also be counted in.
A possibility in another direction is
“Fatty” Lamb, who has cleaned up practi-
cally everything in sight in Australasian
amateur cycling, with record times in nearly
every event. Then there is Harry Pearce,
the N.S.W. champion sculler, who is going
after the Australian title in Hobart next
month, and whom judges who have seen
both men in action rate at least equal to
Beresford, winner at Paris for England in
3924. Whether a rowing eight will go
depends on the decision of the Australian
Rowing Council at Hobart. That body has
already got the wind up. on the score of
expense. In this regard, Maoriland is rais-
ing £5OOO to send an eight to Amsterdam,
and isn’t making a fuss about it either.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Ploughman” : One of those inquisitive folk
who dissect work and play indifferently has
been inquiring into the effect of their occupa-
tions on golfers. Professors, artists, actors
and musicians, he avers, are the world’s
worst players. A close second come editors
and pressmen generally. Higher on the
scale are doctors, clergymen and stockbrokers,
though one would think that the language
question would handicap the cloth. Lawyers
“A WASTED GIFT."
“No, my friend, I don’t take whisky. If I
had a drink of whisky I would be able
to taste it for a couple of days ”
“Hoots, mon! Can ye no see but ye hae
been granted a precious an’ remarkable
prcevilege by th’ Almighty — an’ ye are
no availin’ yersel’ o’ it!”
are the best players of all professional men,
and when one reflects that there is a close
analogy between presenting a convincing case
and handing in a convincing card at the nine-
teenth hole it becomes unnecessary to wonder
at the fact. Government officials and mem-
bers of Parliament are rated as indifferent
performers, which Avill surprise no one who
follows form.
“Rub o’ the Green” : A Scotch wizard lias
walked over the links of Australia; and in
his steps bunkers have been smoothed out
and strange hazards have sprung up in the
middle of sacred fairways. In my club
whenever more hazards were required the
ground committee merely excavated another
bunker across the fairway. I had a theory
that when at last I had managed to do the
round in a hundred the committee hurriedly
called a meeting and either lengthened the
course or sprayed the fairway with more
bunkers. The McKenzie method is designed
to increase the interest in the game of both
long and short markers. The “dog-leg”
principle has been stressed: for the short
marker there is always a short cut, with
the concomitant risks ; but there is a longer
and safer way round, costing an extra stroke,
for the man with that stroke’s handicap.
Bunkers that have broken stout niblicks and
hearts, spoiling a stroke round at the outset,
are now to give way to depressions covered
with thick grass. In short, the canny Scot
promises us golf without tears. And inevit-
ably by-and-bye another Scot will come along
and alter our links all over again.

The annual Oxford-Cambridge golf match
was won by Cambridge, the Light Blues tak-
ing nine matches to six. Oxford won three
of the five foursomes, but Cambridge came
home, 7 to 3, in the singles. Australia was
represented on both sides, Grimwade, a Vic-
torian, playing for Cambridge, and Oppen-
heim for Oxford. A sensational duel between
the two was the feature of the match, Grim-
wade winning at the 41st hole.
* * * *
“Moreliead”: The troubles of the Moore
Park, Sydney, golfers (B. 31/3/’27) are
trifling compared with what they used to be.
Time was when larrikins from slum suburbs
congregated on the links and barracked play-
ers, pointing their remarks with clods and
cow manure when they thought it reasonably
safe. Also, cows and horses roamed over the
fairways unchecked. They stopped innumer-
able shots with their hides and at times clus-
tered about the greens in such numbers that
it was almost impossible to drive a ball
between them. I have seen many a lorn
female bailed up by some placid cow grazing
a few feet from her ball. There was one
particular steep hill up and over which a
drive had to be made. Often when a player
reached the crest he would find that an
urchin had nabbed the ball and was making
good time towards Surry ’llls. Gradually
the golfers have forced junior footballers and
cricketers, two-up schools, amorous couples
and livestock to other corners of the big park
—but it was a tough fight.
Footbrawl
Sydney’s Australian-football season will
open later than that of the other codes,
April 30 being set down for the kick-off. The
district scheme proved a success last season,
and has drawn a lot of new adherents; this
is most noticeable in the primary schools.
Hitherto the Aussie game has been confined
to the Alexandria, Redfern and part of the
Leichhardt school districts. There are no-
ticeable additions this season, and with the
game gaining ground in the schools there
is increased hope for its future in the Ma
State.
“Shrewsbury”: I see the old Pineapple
Rovers Club has been refused affiliation by
I lie Queensland Soccer executive because it
has refused to pay a, £l.O fine inflicted for
declining to play in a match last season,
since when it has been under suspension. The
club, which is about the oldest Soccer organ-
isation in Queensland, with the exception,
perhaps, of the Ipswich Bush Rats, took
its name from a little old pub named the
Pineapple Arms, on Kangaroo Point, which
was said to date back to convict days. iGlub
meetings were held there, and games played
over again in the days before early closing
cast its blighting mantle o’er the land; a
handball court at the back was an ideal spot
to settle a dispute over a referee’s ruling or
any other casus belli. The writer was once
invited to become a member, but a prelimi-
nary visit to an evening meeting and the
consequent bilious' attack next morning con-
vinced him that Queensland Soccer was better
without his assistance.
* * * *
“Past Grammar”: The N.S.W. Rugby
Union has re-elected its selectors of past
seasons —Bosward, Walker anti Griffin. There
is extra importance in the choice, since this
country’s Rugby reputation will rest with
the side to visit England in July. In the
past the selectors, and especially Bosward
and Griffin, have shown themselves inclined
to hang on to the old crocks—the alterations
of the N.S.W. backs in the second test
against Maoril.and last year, after the first
had been brilliantly won by N.S.W., was
a notable instance. The heavy British pro-
gramme will call for players with something
tougher than past reputations to carry them
through. Bosward, too, is obsessed with the
idea that “attack is the best defence.” He
has always had an eye to pace and been
careless of ruggedness. But there comes a
time on every tour when ruggedness is a
side’s last resort. By all accounts, the
English teams are likely to test our forwards
to their utmost. On their heavy grounds
weight and power and the willingness to
use them will be essential. It is a time
for picking forwards built for heavy weather,
and not the Miss Nancys of the open play.
* * * *
“Hotliam”: Some of the big Melbourne
football clubs are facing a “black out.”
The Theatrical Employees’ Union, which
includes people employed in connection with
the strenuous struggles that brighten Mel-
bourne winters, has served a notice on all
the League and Association clubs demand-
ing absolute preference for its members.
Fitzroy, Collingwood, Richmond and Foots-
cray are, so far, the only clubs that have
agreed, and the union threatens to declare
all the others “black” unless they come into
the fold. All unionists are to refrain from
attending matches, and players who are
union members are not to play on “black”
areas or with “black” clubs. If the stunt
comes off, it will be a good test of “soli-
darity.” Most Melbourne football barrackers
are unionists, but I can’t imagine the Mel-
bourne Cricket Ground, say, inhabited by no-
thing save a few members and a stray dog
when Geelong or Essendon goes up against
the Red Legs.

“Centurion”: Every player of field games
has known the man who takes a failure to
heart. No Australian has gone as far in
self-reproach, however, as M. Wisser, a
three-quarter in the Rugby club of Mont-
pellier, France. Wisser scored a last-
minute try which won the game for his
side, but the referee disallowed it, with the
result that the temperamental Provencal shot
himself, in the dressing-room, after the game.
In Australia, if anyone had been shot, it
would have been the referee.
“11. Hardupp”: The practice match
attracted me, and I found the players were
decorating the game, already willing enough,
with conversation of the ejaculatory type:
“Lor’ blime, Gawd damn y’r eyes,” and all
that kind of thing. To another bystander
I remarked that the ’bailers were fond of
calling on the Deity. “Yes,” he replied;
“but, y’ see, these are religious young blokes.
They plays in a church competition.”

“Past Grammar”: The annual report of
the N.S.W. Rugby League is much more
satisfactory than those for previous seasons.
Also, it is much more affable, the League
having tardily realised that the public finds
attraction in other pebbles on the football
beach, and must now be handled gently.
The 1926 receipts were £17,827 4s. Id., and
a credit of £9OBB 4s. 4d. goes forward. If
the League can only build up the shrinking
standard of its players from within, all
should go well.
* * * *
“Centurion”: Once more the proposed
visit to Australia and Maoriland of a
French Rugby Union side has been post-
poned. All was practically fixed up for this
season, but so many French cracks are due
for service with the colors under the new
army law that the arrangements had to
be cancelled. It is a pity, for the Frenchmen
play fiery football of the type the crowd loves,
and such authorities as manager Parata,
of the Maori team which lately toured
France, rank them as fit meat for any inter-
national side.
* * * «
“Amateur Pro.”: A pleasing little sidelight
is thrown on the life of a professional foot-
ball coach by the report of the Temora
(N.S.W.) Rugby League club as discussed
at the annual meeting. The section
dealing with the question of engaging pro-
fessional coaches elicited some illuminating
criticism. One “anti” pleaded that the engage-
ment of a crack metropolitan player didn’t
justify the outlay. As a coach, he
might be O.K. As a player, he was in
another category. The coach-player was so
“crowded” and “dumped” by opposition teams
that attrition marked him for its own. Half
the time he was out of action through injur-
ies and this made him a losing proposition.
There is a good deal in the contention, and
when one hears that the betting hardly re-
coups the backers of the show at the end
of the season, small wonder they desire the
simpler football life of local talent only.
The Ins and Outs
“B. Lauder”: To defeat New South Wales
and Victoria was no mean achievement for
Queensland in its first Sheffield season, and
its two best men were prominent in the
comparative individual returns. O’Connor’s
aggregate of 625 runs was beaten only by
Ponsford (1091), Hendry (780) and Kip-
pax (888) ; and his average, 69.44, was
seventh among those of the 77 players who
represented the States in the competition.
Ronnie Oxenliam made 514 runs, averaging
57.11, and took 18 wickets at 16.94. If
Oxenliam can maintain that form he will
be a certainty for the Tests against the
next team from England.
* * # #
A rare fighter dropped out of the manage-
ment of big cricket when E. E. Bean for-
mally retired from the executive of the Vic.
Cricket Association and from the Board of
iControl, to which he was a delegate. A fine
player himself in his day, Bean developed
into something of a martinet during his long
spell as general secretary of the V.C.A., but
Victorian cricket benefited. With his posi-
tion often threatened by opposing factions,
he invariably overcame them, and lived, in
a cricket sense, to peacefully pass from the
stage. His final warning to the V.C.A., to
fight any attempt to curtail the Sheffield
Shield games, was characteristic of the man.
* * * *
"Der Jong” : It isn’t often that the shadow
of the law invades the pleasaunces of cricket,
but something of the sort is brewing in
Africa. When Lionel Tennyson took an
M.C.C. team to ,S. Africa in 1924-25 the ex-
penses were said to have been guaranteed
by Solly Joel, the .Tewburg millionaire, on
behalf of the S. A. Cricket Association. There
was a loss of £lBOO on the tour, and this
lias been on the ice ever since. Now the
S.A.C.A. has asked Solly what about it,
and he has replied that he vill be damdt
if he vill. So Solly and the association are
getting set to clash in the courts.
* * * *
“Tuart”: A visiting S. Aus. team with
only five of the State’s Sheffield Shield XI
twice defeated the Westralians —by 93 runs
in the first match and by eight wickets in
the second. Inverarity and Evans did credit-
able things with the ball for the Jarrah-
landers, but the batting failed badly. The
standard of cricket has slipped in the
Western State since the days of Ernie
Parker, who fell in France, and Bobbie Selk.
There is some promising material among
the young fellows, but it needs coaching snch
as a man like Arthur Richardson could give.
With £2OOO available from the Board of
Control, the W.A.C.A. ought to be in a
position to buy the needful and give the
young chaps their chance.
* * * *
Queensland cricketers will wind up their
season in holiday fashion with a series of
games against a strong N.S.W. team, engi-
neered by E. R. Bubb. No matches will be
played in Brisbane, the side opening at
Innisfail on Saturday next, and playing south
through Cairns, Townsville. Rockhampton
and other coastwise towns to Nambour, which
is between Gympie and Brisbane. As the
team includes such stars as Jack Gregory,
Ivippax (skip.), Jackson, Morgan, McNamee,
E. L. Waddy and other inter-State and Shef-
field Shield players, the northerners are
likely to get good value for their entrance
money.
The good-looking stripling in this picture
is Archie Jackson, the Balmain (N.S.W.)
boy who has jumped in one season from
the comparative obscurity of grade matches
to a place in the front rank of Australian
cricket. Only 18, he is already a finished
batsman, as spectators in the capitals where
Sheffield Shield matches are played have
had delightful opportunities of seeing. In
Sydney grade cricket Jackson has scored 870
in 10 completed innings, and he might have
reached the 1000 runs mark, hitherto attained
only by Truinper (1021 in 1897-8), Mackay
(1041 in 1905-6) and Warren Bardsley (1145
in 1918-19), if rain had not interfered with
the last round. In addition to being a fast-
scoring batsman possessed of all the strokes,
lie is a smart and sure - outfield.
* * * *
“Te Kooti” : The Maoriland cricket eleven
has departed on its pioneer tour of England.
On their form in Australia in 1924-25, and
against the Melbourne C. C. XI last month,
the Maorilanders should have a good season,
for they are up to first-class county form.
Much is hoped of young Merritt, who is
that most unusual bowling type, a left-hand
“bosie.” If lie can reproduce the form that
has got him, at 19 years, into the All Black
XI, a lot of English averages will be the
poorer for him.
* * * *
“Bramall Lane” : The lot of the English
professional cricketer is not “roses, roses, all
the way,” even in these days. Cabled that
Root, the Worcestershire bowler, whose leg-
theory success against the Australians Lst
year made him, for a fleeting hour, the ’ 10l
of English cricket, has gone bankrupt. His
discharge was granted on a composition of lOd.
in the pound. Root, it seems, lost heavily on
his trip to the West Indies ; citing the heavy
expenses of the tour, he averred that he had
often had to pay Is. for a bottle of water.
The times have changed, and the “pros.”
with them. What old-timer in Britain can
visualise Tom Emmett and George Ulyett, say,
throwing away their substance buying water:
* * * *
“Centurion”: The retirement from regu-
lar cricket of Bill Howell, mighty left-hand
smiter and right-hand bowler of former days,
is announced. W.P., to give him his formal
prefix, was a curious example of an inter-
national bowler happened on by the merest
chance. Chosen as a batsman for N.S.W.
against Stoddart’s 1894-95 team, he was
only tried as a bowler as a last resort and at
his own request, and was an instantaneous
success. Though a regular bowler in the
N.S.W. side thereafter, he did not visit
England till 1899, when he proved one of
the star trundlers of Darling’s first team,
his capture of all 10 wickets in an innings
against Surrey putting the seal on his fame.
Bill’s test-match bowling average, 35 wickets
at 35.28 runs each, is not impressive, but
lie was wonderfully accurate, and deadly
with his fast off-break on a wicket which
“did a bit.” His test batting average. 8.11
with a h.s. of 35. was also far below
his general form. For years since leaving
tirst-class cricket he has been doing big
things in country matches up Richmond
(N.S.W.) way. ___
Car and Cycle
The notion, cherished in Britain and fost-
ered by literary gents who come here to
enhance their reputation as explorers, that
Australia is a wild and savage land teeming
with dangers is being severely dinted by
women who persist in driving motor-cars
quite peacefully and happily from one end
of the continent to the other. The latest
little trip of this kind, a ramble from Sydney
to Perth undertaken by Airs. G. Sandford
and Miss S. Christie, was done in a closed
car —an Essex coach —and was so enjoyable
that Mrs. Sandford now proposes to take
the ’bus from Adelaide to Darwin.
* * * *
Segrave, the English driver, proved in
Florida last week that, with careful atten-
tion to weight-distribution, additional power
can be made to produce additional speed up
to limits —in Segrave’s case—of 1000-h.p.
and close on 204 m.p.h. Since similar
speeds can he attained much more cheaply
and safely in the air, and maintained for
much longer periods, the practical value
of the experiment ends there. But the
advertisement of the skill of British engi-
neers and the daring of British drivers is
worth a lot. American makers spend more
in a month on speed experiments than Eng-
lish makers do in a year, but every epoch-
making record has been made by a Britisher.
Percy Lambert was the first driver to attain
100 m.p.h.. S. F. Edge was the first to hold
a mile-a-minute clip for 24 hours. In the
last year or so 40 m.p.h. has been added
to the maximum possible speed, and the
record-holders have been Parry Thomas, an
Australian, and Campbell and Segrave, born
in the Old Dart. The worst of the game is
that it kills so many good men.
* * * *
The young man in the picture is “Fatty”
Lamb, who, though not yet 21, has proved
himself one of the greatest amateur cyclists
who have ever straddled a bike. Born at
Newmarket (Vic.), he got into the first class
by winning the 10-miles championship of
Australia in Sydney three years ago. Next
year he annexed the five-miles laurels in
Brisbane, and since then he has gone from
triumph to triumph at all distances from
one to 10 miles. Crossing to Maoriland,
“Fatty” picked up the half-mile and three-
miles championships of the Shivery Isles, as
well as provincial titles for a mile and three
miles at Wanganui. He has won the Goul-
burn-Sydney road race twice in succession
—the only man who has done it —and holds
the record for that punishing 130 miles —
6 hours 17 minutes. Behind motor pace in
Melbourne he has been clocked to cover
10 miles in lOmin. 2-ssecs.
“Exhaust” : It's not all beer and skittles
running a speedway. The proprietors of a
Brisbane enterprise recently prosecuted a
blackmailer who sent them a copy of an
article with the covering information that
it hadn’t been printed yet but would he if
they failed to come to light with “something
substantial.” Under instructions, the pro-
prietary handed over £5O in marked notes;
then a detective arrived; the jury said
“Guilty.” and Blair, C.J., murmured some-
thing about “eighteen months’ hard labor,
to date from the third of February.” The
mildest part of the blackmailing scm-.l
affirmed that speedway motor-cyclists were
“poorly paid,” and that “another strike was
inevitable.” Sure enough, there was a strike
last week, though it was no outcome of the
Criminal Court proceedings; and the pro-
prietary moodily announced that the speed-
way would be closed “until the riders became
amenable to reason.”
* * # *
J. D. Rockefeller and liis associates move
in a mysterious way their wonders to per-
form. The cut of 2d. a gallon in petrol prices
in the Commonwealth, however, follows
a world-wide movement, said to be due to
the re-influx of supplies from Russian wells.
It’s a good wind that blows nobody any
harm, and the Commonwealth refineries are
sufferers by the latest cut. which robs them
of their price-advantage. Possibly that aspect
of the matter weighed with those who
allowed Australia to participate in the
latest fluctuation.
Miscellaneous
“Line”: There is not a .fisherman born
who will not argue long about the best bait
for black bream. Pippies, prawns and worms
are most in favor; but bream will not always
take any of them. When this happens mullet
gut may serve, and (if money is no object)
so may oysters scorched hard in the shells:
but on a recent visit to Narooma (N.S.W.),
where the bream run to four pounds, I found
the best catches being made on hunks of fresh
salmon. A new hook on the market, with
a barb half way up the back, is helpful tn
those inexpert in fixing bait.
The Oxford-Cambridge boatrace was rowed
over the Putney-Mortlake course on Satur-
day. the . Cantabs winning by three lengths
in 20min. 14sec. Of the 79 races rowed the
Light Blues have taken 38 and Oxford 40.
there having been one deadheat; Cambridge
has got away with seven of the eight races
held since the war. Report credits the Cam-
bridge men wdth being cleverer in the rough
water on Saturday, and Bell, the Geelong
oarsman, is singled out for special mention.
“Shrewsbury”: A section of the English
press has heen shedding tears because of
Oxford’s pronounced inferiority to Cam-
bridge at athletic sports and games. The
theory. is that the Dark Blues are getting
“feminised” because there are “too many
girls” in Oxford; the undergrads., it is
alleged, prefer tea parties to rowing and
Rugby, or even beer. Putting the girls on
one side, the tea-drinking theory is thin.
The Australian, in the bulk, cannot be
deemed “feminised” or unhandy at games,
yet he drinks more tea than any other human
on earth.
* * * *
The next race for the world’s professional
sculling championship may take place in San
Diego, California. Major Goodsell, now in
the U.S.A., has cabled Paddy Hannan, of
Maoriland, offering to give him a race there.
Provided a satisfactory date can be
arranged, Plannan is willing; he can get back-
ing (if any is needed), is always in pretty
. good condition, and is ready to start for
California by the next boat.
* * * *
“Outball”: Sydney polo men have been
interested in the form shown by the Re-
nown’s officers who were made free of the
Sydney club’s ground at Kensington and
supplied with ponies, sticks, etc. There is
an impression that the sailor is a dud on
a horse; as a matter of fact, many naval
men, especially those who have had a chance
to play the game seriously at Malta, are
cpiite in the front rank. One of the best
polo players Australia knew in the early
days of the game here, when N.S.W. players,
generally with “Banjo” Paterson, used to
invade Queensland, was Commander Wright,
who had been O.C. the then Queensland
Navy. Wright settled in Johannesburg after
the South African war, as a professional
horse-trainer. His eldest son, born in Queens-
land, was the stable’s leading jockey.
* * * *
“Count Drolatique” : Granville Ryrie is a
bridge addict. Barring swapping yarns with
Diggers he knows no happier moment than
when he is going for a real Hindenbury
slam, with a hand well stacked in three
suits and dummy supporting him strongly
in the fourth. Late strollers at the top end of
Bourke-street. Melbourne, have often had
their eyes caught by a solitary, well-lit
window in the bleak facade of Parliament
House. Most assumed that S. M. Bruce
was grappling with another despatch from
Downing-street: but others, better informed,
knew that a bridge school was in session,
and that in all probability the bluff old
soldier was trying not to qualify for the
dunce’s cap. The day Ryrie received notice
of his London appointment from Bruce, he
thanked the P.M. in unusually husky tones
and for a considerable time remained over-
come by the rain of congratulations from all
parties. But that night the pasteboards
were-flying round on the baize once more,
and the voice that Light-horsemen will never
forget was heard to say cheerfully: “I go
two hearts.” The Brig was himself again.

DA .803 —Andantino Lemare
Humoresque (Op. 10, No. 2)
Tschaikowsky—Kreisler 7/6
Lemare’s Andantino must be familiar to
most music lovers, whether tastes lean
towards the frankly “popular” or in another
direction. It has one of those melodies
which by virtue of their popularity becomes
known to the public in a number of forms,
and this particular melody has even figured
as the basis of an unusually successful fox-
trot.
JOHN McCORMACK (Tenor).

DA765 —Just a Cottage Small . .J. F. Hanley
Mother, My Dear Brycesson
Treharne 7/6
This great tenor has sung two delightful
ballads for this record. “Just a* Cottage
Small” is extremely popular just now, whilst
its companion is a “Mother” song of excep-
tionally appealing character.
A Marvellous Record.
LAWRENCE TIBBETT (Baritone).

cavallo 10/6
There are many recorded versions of the
Prologue from “Pagliacci,” but none like this
one, the orchestral accompaniment being a
revelation in itself. The orchestral volume
does not drown the voice, yet it is louder
and richer than any orchestral record made
by the old process. A truly magnificent,

The White Rose composed of 12,000 Aus-
tralian kiddies that bloomed on the Cricket
(Wound was the most fragrant greeting the
Royal tourists met. The Duchess, in chiffons
as ethereal as the plumbago, looked rather
like a school kid herself as she laughed and
talked with animation to Minister of Education
Tom Match. The Duke wasn't so lucky in
liis companion—Director-of-Education Smith :
his diet appeared to be solemn statistics. The
Duchess was half an hour late, and some of
the small girls in the minimum of clothing
who were to form the big “Welcome” as well
as the posy grew goose-fleshy, for the day
was grey and there was a nip in the air.
Hut after she had begged for and got a
whole week’s extra holiday at Easter, enthu-
siasm positively flared up among the scraps
of humanity in fluttering white.
While the Duke and his lady were meshed
in by a closely-woven net of kiddies a small
girl displayed those qualities which make
Napoleons. 11.R.H. came to a pause. It
was then lie felt a tug at his sleeve, and
heai'd a piping voice: “Please give us a holi-
day!” The Duke looked at Mr. Mutch, and
Mr. Mutch said something about a day.
“Oh,” cried the small girl, in the voice of one
who feels cheated, “but the Prince gave us a
week!” Then H.R.H. Elizabeth took a hand.
“You can’t let your unmarried brother beat
you!” she announced firmly, as though it
was almost a reflection on herself, and the
Duke declared it a fair thing.
For weeks past all the little women’s
societies of Sydney have been rushing to be-
come affiliated with the National Council.
This gave them the privilege of sending repre-
sentatives to bob to the Duchess at the party
organised by the council. At the Great Event,
therefore, there were hundreds of ladies
gathered together at the Uni., mostly elderly,
generally very firm-lipped, and representing
everything from the League of Nations to
the Back Creek Voters’ League. The
Duchess, her blue raiment putting to sham*
Sydney’s grey sky, sat under a tent-like
umbrella on the lawn outside the Union, and
smiled and smiled while Prof. Mungo Mac-
Callum’s lady, who is president of the Coun-
cil, made the announcements and the ladies
passed before her. The presentations fol-
lowed the reception of the Duchess in the
hall of the Union. Ilere the stage was set
with foliage, and was as drugged with the
scents of the earth as the songs of Solomon.
In the middle thereof, in a high-backed,
heavily-carved chair, satElizabcth of York, her
blue-and-gold brocaded coat wrapped around
her—you’ve seen how the Bondi flapper
folds her “bunny” firm about the hip-line. An
address engrossed and luscious with illumina-
tion, packed in a beautifully-tooled blue-
leather binding, was handed to the Duchess.
But the rarest bit of beauty was the bunch
of surprised Christmas-bush specially forced
to adorn H.R.H.’s lapel.
“Pinafore” was the opera chosen to be
performed before Royalty. For the occa-
sion the G. and S. bubble was blown about
the stage of Her Majesty’s, its former
moorings at the Royal being taken by “Tell
Me More.” Golden roses and golden lights
rained their splendor from on high: in
every nook and cranny about the stalls
and the dress-circle they glowed and lan-
guished. Great hanging baskets cascaded
from the ceiling; festoons of green softened
an effect that might easily have been garish.
Along the edges of the Royal and vice-
regal boxes grew real lily-of-the-valley and
white roses.
Before a quarter to eight the vast audience
was all seated—even Priminister Bruce and
his lady, who received an ovation as they
entered the d.-c. At eight o’clock four
heralds dressed out of the Firm’s wardrobe
blew a fanfare to the north, the south, the
east and the west of the Persian Garden
which on ordinary nights is the vestibule.
Then the Duchess came sparkling in like the
picture of a snow maiden, the hoar-frost
effect being diamentc over georgette. Her
tiara allied turquoise and diamonds, her
right arm was a fire of diamond bracelets
and she completed the Hails Andersen pic-
ture with a slim cloak befurred with white
fox. Twice during the evening the Royal-
ties gave the house a chance to gaze upon
them. After “Trial by Jury” they swapped
places with the De Chairs, who were boxed
opposite; and at half-time they changed
back again. They went behind and the
players were presented; they smiled, they
looked delighted. But once or twice the
Duke's hand went up to his head—he had
made rather a day of it. The Countess of
Cavan, with rubies in her hair, sat with
them; and Lady de Chair’s diamonds above
her rose brocades were not to be outwinked
by any. Daughter Elaine flew green and
gold taffetas, and was brave in a new coat
of blue and silver brocades. All the Army
and the Navy was present with its wife. So
was Mayor Mostyn, whose lady was in cycla-
men georgette. One box was dedicated to
Paderewski and Mrs. Paderewski, with
Claude Kingston as aide; opposite sat E. J.
Tait, surounded by his daughters.
Fifty thousand turned up to the. people’s
levee at the Town ITall. The poor darlings
were put through rather like meat in a
sausage-machine. ’Tention ! Quick march !
In at the east, out at the west, 20 deep, no
loitering— please! Every woman with a baby
thrust it forward as close to the Duchess as
possible. Women and men patted her hand
and the hand of the Duke. After a while the
Duke managed to be just beyond range, but
the Duchess let them pat as much as they
liked —and seemed to enjoy it.
On Thursday and Friday our blue-blooded
and other visitors saw what they could of the
Blue Mountains through a blur of politi-
cians. On Saturday and Sunday, as the
guests of the Macarthur On slows, they saw
what they could of Camden through.a blur
of rain. But they think that New South
Wales rain is not so pervasive as her poll
ticians.
On the way to the Caves. James Dooley,
Speaker of the House, made history by hold-
ing up the Royal car and luring its occu-
pants to the side of the road to unveil a. tab-
let in a soldiers’ memorial hospital. Mr.
Dooley’s smile seems to have more power to
persuade the Duchess than to charm Miss
Preston Stanley. The soldiers’ memorial is
in Mr. Dooley’s electorate, but unveiling the
tablet was not listed as one of the Duchess’s
official duties. The Earl of Cavan and
Brudenell White came back to Sydney with
more pleats than ever in their brows.
Wednesday night was the only one on
which the Ducal pair were free of the offi-
cial leash, so the State Ex. and daughter
Elaine ’phoned their intimates to come up
to the big house for a private party. The
Duchess retired early, leaving the Duke to
carry on—of course, only in a strictly official
capacity.
. Mrs. 11. C. S. Wilkinson is the pleasant
“lady of the house” at No. 1 Wharf, Circu-
lar Quay, and any sailor on the Renown will
smile widely at mention of that address. It
is the citizens’ canteen, and the cheeriest
spot in Sydney
for the 1200
Jack Tars of
the party. Mrs.
Wilkinson is
the energetic
and capable
organiser who
made this can-
teen possible.
Modelled o n
the one which
catered so well
for the Ameri-
can fleet, it is
perhaps the
one unalloyed
success of the
visit. Each day
a different host
and hostess are
the entertain-
ers, and this
privilege costs
them £5O. But
to tlie hospitable Harry Dransfield couple
the reckoning must have been nearer £lOO.
The Undergrads, run the canteen at night.
The Barnardo Ball, happening on the only
Ducal night off, had to revolve without the
smile of Vice-Royalty, _ although Lady de
Chair was president of its senior committee
and Elaine president of its younger-set com-
mittee. Of course, the vice-reine could not
leave the bridge when Royalty was aboard;
but, as, one of the younger set remarked:
“Even if the skipper couldn’t come, surely
the skipper’s little daughter could have
spared us half an hour!’’ The big expecta-
tion behind the 1200 tickets sold was the
appearance of T.R.H. at the frivol. And the
Wentworth that night was a fitting setting
for Royalty. Flowers everywhere massed in
profusion, a dais set with gilded throne-
chairs, rich dresses, jewels, and hearts stirred
by loyalty—though, to be sure, even among
the ladies these were under cover. No woman
could tell the other why she knew the Duke
and Duchess would turn up. No promise
had been made, but the hope persisted, and
it was only when the bandsmen finally corked
up their instruments that tin- North Shore
liners, who were thick as bees, gave up
watching the door, eagerly, feverishly as a
condemned man might the door of his cell
in hope of a reprieve. But the affair was
a success, and the girls, especially those danc-
ing with Renown officers, had a look of
ineffable bliss. These English Johns, by the
way, hold their partner’s right hand close
up to the left ear, as though listening-in
to a rare shell picked up on a golden strand.
One of them got the shock of his life when
his partner suddenly murmured up at him:
“What are the wild waves saying?”
Among other things the Duke found time
to do in Sydney was to become a Doctor of
Laws. He was assisted to this eminence
by Vice-Chancellor Mungo MacCallum,
Deputy-Chancellor Justice Street and a
group of solemn greybeards; and the under-
grads, letting off steam in the quadrangle,
gave him the final leg up. He lunched with
the Returned Soldiers’ League, and thereby
became a Digger. And he unveiled John
Longstaff's portrait of Surgeon-Knight
Alexander MacCormick in the Great Hall
of the Uni. One of the tasks that really
interested him was pinning the Albert Medal
on Stanley Gibbs, the hero who tried to
save his chum’s life at the risk of his own,
at Port Hacking, by fighting off with his
bare fists a man-eating shark.
This is the
wife of Gen-
eral Granville
Ryrie, who has
just been ap-
pointed Aus-
tralia’s High
G o mxnissioner
in London. The
soldier knight
and his lady
have a line
reputation for
h o s p i tality;
and they are
both of the
type that
mak e s firm
friendships.
It is true
that Mrs. Lang
was ill, but,
even so, was
there any other
of his Ministers
who could have resisted the lure of examining
the Caves in company with a Duke and a
Duchess? And put it to his credit, too, that
he refused to ask for one’ extra card for any
of the junketings.
When the Prince could really shake the
locusts off, lie got to the tennis court at
Government House; and here Noel Heath,
Ryder Swinson and young Reading were his
playfellows.
The Royal party didn’t run the risk of
lacking a change of linen while at Govern-
ment House. It took sweating sailors nearly
a day to transport their personal luggage
from the Renown to Macquarie-street; and
while the front entrance was all soldiers and
bauds and Boy Scouts, the back entrance was
blocked with motor-lorries. Trunks and bags
and cases were carried in in a seemingly
unending stream. Every cranny and corridor
of Government House was morocco-bound and
pig-skinned. The new wallpapers didn’t get
half a chance to show their design. After
that who can doubt that Queen Mary whis-
pered to her royal daughter-in-law the story of
the cruet stolen from the Opliir 26 years ago?
“Here is a gentlemap. Let us treat him
as such!” The phrase leaped out from a
novel last week at a mind bemused with
reading the fulsome exclamations of the
daily press on the behavior of the Duke.
Australia loses face by these outpourings of
astonishment over the Royalties’ acts of
courtesy and consideration. To comment
on an act of good breeding is an insult by
insinuation. It hints that the observer did
not credit the Duke and his lady with fine
feelings—or perhaps it hints that the
observer is himself so lacking in the fine feel-
ing which prompted the delicate action that
he would not have been capable of it himself.
Such an attitude is fair neither to the
Royalties nor to ourselves.
The Big Brother Ball netted a big fish,
though it wasn’t the Duke. Captain Sullivan,
of the Renown, flashed his uniform his
smile on the committee-women about supper-
time, and they felt that, short of Government
House, the Ambassadors held the most dis-
tinguished man in Australia. They may even
have voiced the thought, for this son of Nep-
tune wore a look of great content for the
rest of the evening. Mrs. Charles Hotham
was president of the committee that had
engineered this success.
The demand for Renown officers at Sydney
parties this week lias been keen. Shrewd
secretaries of charity functions have read
aloud such memos, as this: “Thirty officers
to be present. Who wishes to be hostess to
two?” Hands went up in a flash, and lest
there should be any disappointment over
delivery the ticket money for the sailor
guests was usually paid on the spot.
Really the most striking feature of the
visit has been the eclipse of the Duke by
liis partner. All the women want to see
the Duchess, and the men—well, naturally
the men would always prefer to eye a woman.
So wherever the crowds were lined up on
the chance of seeing the pair, there could
be heard the excited feminine murmurs of
“Here she comes!” much oftener than “Here
they come!”
The really select, the people who look as
though having a limousine on earth entitles
them to a box-seat in Heaven, put in an
appearance at the Rose Bay Golf Club on
Thursday. Wonderful clothes graced this
ball for the Renown officers, but there were
not nearly enough uniforms to partner the
expensively-dressed sex that gathered for the
event. Colonel Bertram and his staff had
made the club most attractive with pink
gladioli and roses and music—two bands, no
less. Mrs. Charlie Lempriere, Dame Nellie
Melba's youngest sister, who is over from
Victoria with her daughter, was quietly
resplendent in dull gold tissue with a Leng-
len bandeau of gold and turquoise on her
hair. The A. J. Warrys and Claud Readings
joined forces and dined a large company ai
the club prior to the dance. Mrs. Frank
McDonald was among their guests, wearing
a wonderful frock of black and blue and
steel sequins. Mrs. Willie Collins, in palest
maize color, was kept busy greeting friends;
with Mrs. McDonald, the Stephen dame,
Mrs. Sydney Jamieson and many other well-
known Sydney folk she had returned by the
Mooltan. Late in the evening the brides-
maids from the Farncomb-Ross Nott wed-
ding arrived with some of the guests. Their
frocks, which had ankle-length, transparent
lace flounces, were things of beauty, and
their little lace caps were quaint and becom-
ing. It was a pity, though, that many young
things had been deluded into leaving spaces
on their programmes for the men of the
sea; those wise virgins who arrived with
their own partners proved that a bird in
the hand is worth two in the crush.
Sydney’s veteran ex-Town Clerk Thomas
Nesbitt, now well forward in his seventies,
was married for the second time on Monday.
His bride was a Mrs. Jeffrey, widow and
one-time resident of Dunedin (Maoriland).
Olive Crane and Ken. McQueen have
decided to save expense and share a studio.
To this end the two clever young artists
were married on Saturday at the Wollstone-
craft home of the Cranes.
There was more gold braid served witli
flashing swords at Strathfield the other day
than the suburb could view without blinking.
The occasion was the wedding of Jean, third
bud of the Arthur Ross Notts, to Lieut.
Harold Farncomb, of H.M.A.S. Sydney.
Trinity Congregational Church purred over
the event, and the bride’s frock of rich satin
the shade of frangipanni-blossom caused a
whirlwind of excitement. The dress was
ankle length, its hem of cream tulle starting
about the bend of the knee, the whole thing
delicately embroidered in pearls and dull gold
thread. A tulle train and veil were added
graces. Three maids were fichued and mit-
tcned and lace-bonneted in pink and mauve
and powder-blue chiffons. _ A small train-
bearer strewed rose-leaves in the path, and
later, at Bickley, the bride’s mother hostessed
in black lace and melting blue chiffons. _
Other ring events attracting attention are
the plighting of “Bon” Hilliard to Keith
Anderson, a well-known flying man of Perth •
and of Kathleen Butler, the girl who helped
Dr. Bradfield with the North Shore Bridge,
to M. Hagaerty, of the northern State.
The Premier’s third daughter, Laura, ha>
been getting herself engaged. The young man
in. the case is Frederick Hill, of Auburn, too.
For her wedding, Tootles, only child of
the late J. C. Williamson, chose a mglu
when all the world was “dooking the Book.
St. Canice’s, in Darlinghurst, had the atmo-
sphere of some quiet haven. Tootles wore one
of those simple confections in white chitton
that only heiresses can wear, and
it with a train of rose point lace, also ot
great price. Her somewhat statuesque good
looks stood out with distinction against tin
mist of white tulle veiling, and the roses and
lilies-of-the-valley in her hands seemed a tit-
ting accompaniment. Only bridesman
Dorothy Coffee carried red roses against hei
froth of white lace and chiffon. The bride-
groom was Wallace Horsley, of xabtrei
station, and Padre Crowley tied the knot.
Bride’s mother, Mrs. .T. C. Williamson, latei
entertained the small wedding party at her
flat in Greenknowe-avenue, Potts Point.
Mrs. Elizabeth Ann Lassetter, stricken
with mortal illness, went back to Picton
her girlhood’s home —to die. She wanted t<
see the last sunsets glint behind the grov ,s
of eucalyptus that fringe the paddocks ot Jar
visfield, home of the late John Macquarn

accurately focus the picture up to
the instant of exposure. This is
valuable where the object is in
motion and the great range of
speeds—l-15th to l-1000th sec. —of
the Ensign focal plane shutter
ensures that there is practically
no moving subject outside its

Melbourne’s preparation for the Royal visi-
tors is proceeding languidly. The trappings
that did service ior Prince Teddy’s visit are
being; haled forth from dusty lumber-rooms,
•md the letters “G.R.,” that once stood for
"Government Railways,” have been raised
pm tem. to the dignity of representing George
Rex. About the only innovation noted so
far is an ebullition of shamrocky designs of
white, which look rather like tarts, but con-
form to the heraldic specifications of the Rose
of York. With the Ducal doings only a fort-
night a wav the shin Med sex is in a ferment
of uncertainty about clothes, for there is not
a card of invitation out yet, save for the
Canberra canter. Establishments for the
sewing together of glad rags are comfort-
ably busy at present with the usual winter
season’s work, and those who hesitate to
order the frock that may or may not be
wanted are filled with dire forebodings.
A section of Melbourne war memorial
committee has gone cold on the scheme for
establishing Anzac Square in Spring-street
at the top of Bourke-street. The idea involved
buying the annexe of the Hotel Windsor and
the Imperial, on the opposite corner. This
section now wants the site of the present
Melbourne High School, which fronts Spring,
Victoria, Evelyn and Lonsdale streets. Years
ago, Charles Summers, the artist, showed
that by taking in the portion of Lonsdale-
street fronting the high school and joining
on to the triangular block in front of that
thoroughfare, the north-western end of the
city could be transformed into a thing of
beauty. Of course he contemplated wiping
out the semi-slum buildings on the south
side of Spring-street between Little Bourke
and Latrobe streets. If those in authority or
semi-authority could only make up their
minds as to what they do want, something
could be done with the areas available in
the Spring-street locality. There are no
women on the war memorial committee or
the City Council, so mind-changing is not
due to the exercise of a privilege supposed to
attach to femininity.
It was an Americanised version of Francle
Anderson, who now answers to the name
o! Judith, that Melbournites welcomed home
at the Theatre Royal on Saturday night.
She brings back with her the intonation ant
mannerisms of the country that gave hei
stardom, and also a perfect figure. Hei
clothes in “Tea for Three” are beautifully
moulded to her supple form. The black
ensemble suit worn in the first act har
a couple of petunia-pink tassels of hugi
size dangling over a full front panel of peri
winkle-biue georgette, and coque feathers
curl from a tall sapphire-blue hat, brushing
one shoulder. Into the picturesque rooms
of her former admirer, where black candle.*
in brass candelabra glimmer over oak and
tapestry, the lady rushes in clinging raiment
of pink, sparkling beneath a gold wrap
Very filmy black lace is the gown l'or Act
11. Though almost lost to view behind tin
piles of flowers that greeted her, the re
turned Aussie could not be prevailed upon tc
murmur “Thank you.” so Leon Gordon had
to do it for her. In the stalls were the W. M.
Robins couple, Dr. and Mrs. Barry Thom-
son, she wearing the last whisper in theatri-
cal millinery, a toque of pink briar roses;
Mrs. Herbert Hewlett and daughter Nancy.
The Taits and others connected with the
f irm saw the show from boxes. Dr. Ethel
Osborne and her daughter were among d.-c.
patrons.
Most successful of the Shakspearean per-
formances at the Princess was “As You Like
It." a regular frolic, in which Miss Hunter-
Watts, as Rosalind, wore her masculine
attire, of green with much jauntiness. Her
feminine garb of blendings of blue and pink
flowered brocade, with pink roses wreathing
her auburn locks, worn in the last act, was
highly effective. The dressing, indeed, was
good throughout, and the Forest of Arden
} v as prettily depicted. The boys and girls
w the audience particularly enjoyed the
production, and parents feel themselves in-
debted to Allan Wilkie and his competent
company. “Henry VIII.” had a welcome
revival on Saturday night.
The old Argus office, purchased several
months ago by J. and N. Tait, since wliipli it
has been unoccupied, was put to use for. a
couple of days lately when it housed a sale
of goods in aid of the Free Kindergarten
holiday home at Blackburn. Past students
and the V.IJ.A. of the, Free Kindergarten
Union furnished the stalls. Mayoress
Morell, who is developing a talent for neat
speeches, declared that the sale was on, and
started off to do some marketing herself,
bearing a just-acquired posy of pink roses.
The Spencer lady, president of the union,
and Mrs. M. M. Phillips, hon. organiser of
“The Shop,” did the honors. Betty Fair-
bairn, Constance Burke and Miss Reynolds,
of* the Past-Students’ Association, lent a
hand. Among the wares were woollies for
infants, fancy goods, flowers, sweets and
home-made preserves and cakes. The pro-
moters aimed at netting £lOOO.
A bridge party held at the Wattle Path
Palais at St. Kilda the other afternoon was
a plank in a much bigger affair. The
Charities’ Auxiliary Association, which was
responsible, got it up to pay the expenses of
a dance on the 29th, and the proceeds of the
frivol, in turn, will be used to finance a season
at the Playhouse. The ultimate beneficiaries
include the Tweddle Hospital. Missions of St.
elude the Tweddle Hospital, Missions of St.
James and St. John, and other institutions.
The Theatre Association of Victoria will
produce a comedy. Phillips Curwen lent
the dance rendezvous for the occasion, and
Hoffman’s orchestra provided a not-too-
distracting tonal background for the grave
deliberations of the bridgeites. Of course
there were raffles, for articles donated by
friendly firms, and stalls of flowers, cakes
and confectionery. Aubrey Dye was hon.
ticket secretary ; Dr. Guy Springthorpe trea-
surer and G. F. Arnoldt hon. organiser.
Betty Ross Clarke and Laura Smithson
stepped off “The Ghost Train” to help with
the vending of goods. Elmer Pauly’s wife also
gave a hand, and told how real glad she was
her husband’s mission as U-S.A. Trade Com-
missioner had brought her back to Mel-
bourne.
Elise Steele, of Castlemaine, who put in
some years of violin study at the N.S.W.
Conservatorium and was under the Verbrug-
glien baton, has been doing a bit of advertis-
ing for Australia in the U.S.A. She has
been over there since June, 1925, had some
lessons from Leon Sametini in Chicago, and
has filled various concert engagements.
Leopold Auer, maestro of Mischa Elman,
Jascha Heifetz and Seidel, whom we have
heard here, and of Zimbalist, who is due
shortly, liked the maiden’s work so much
that lie took her as a pupil. She won his
Summer Scholarship and he gave her a debut
in New York in February last. Press notices
were very encouraging. In the audience
were Hugh Denison and his lady, who
brought along several friends. There were
lashings of flowers for the clever Australian
bow-wielder. Miss Steele hopes to go to
England ‘in May, returning to New York
in August to give a series of concerts.
Delightful to all booklovers and art appre-
ciators are the black-and-white drawings and
water-colors of
clever Ida
Rentoul Outlr-
waite. She has
introduced us
for many
years to fairy
sprites in the
shape of frail,
golden - haired
lassies with
butterfly
wings, who
float on cob-
webs, winged
insects of the
morning-glory
blooms; to
strange pi g-
mies, friendly
toads, bears
and other crea-
tures almost
human. Here
is a portrait
of the lady, who lately gladdened a few more
thousands of people here and abroad with
her beautiful Fairyland book. She is a
daughter of the late Professor Rentoul. and
in her own home she is Mrs. Grenbry Outh-
waite, but the world knows her creations
best as those of Ida Rentoul. Sister Annie’s
talents run to fascinating verse-making.
At the Assembly Hall last week the
British Music Society offered a tribute to
the deaf old man of Bonn who made such
mighty music. Specimens of the master’s
works were given by Rita Hope, Colin
Thomson, Jessie McMichael and the society’s
string quartette, which has now become an
“all-girl” affair i Bertha Jorgensen has been
raised to the post of first violin, and the
new member is violinist Hope Scott, of the
auburn locks. Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, hon. repre-
sentative of the B.M.S. in Victoria, was there
on the eve of a sojourn abroad. Mrs. Dyer
received a boat made of tiny pink roses,
having as sail a gold-stringed' treble stave,
with some wee buds picking out the air of
“Will Ye No Come Back Again?”
The latest Australian Anthem —libretto by
C. J. Dennis and music by pianist-composer
.Tames—will smite the welkin, impelled by
850 voices and 150 players on cunning in-
struments, at the Exhibition on April 28, as
part of the State Government’s entertainment
of the Yorks. Thirteen choral societies of
the city and suburbs will be implicated.
Contralto Phyllis Lett is due back in
Melbourne this week after her triumphal
march through Maoriland. The progress of
Albert and Elizabeth through the Common-
wealth is making the arrangement of Aus-
tralian dates a matter of careful study, and
so far decisions are reserved.
This is Bill Mclnnes’s picture of Mrs.
Jimmy Dyer, which might be catalogued as
“The Lady in Black.” The former chate-
laine of Kin-
noull, who sat
for her por-
trait in black
lace and velvet
with a slight
brocading o f
dull gold, re-
ceived the
work as a
farewell token
from friends,
o n li e r de-
parture to re-
side on the
other side of
the world.
Both she a n d
he r husband
str o ve vali-
antly for the
advancementof
music in this
city, and Mr.
Dyer’s gift of ■ .
flO,OOO will found a permanent orchestra in
Melbourne —when and if the city decides that
the idea is worth acting upon. His gift
of £5OO to Melbourne’s Symphony Orchestra,
in memory of its late conductor, Alberto
Zellman, has put that organisation on its
feet. The reproduction of the Mclnnes por-
trait is by Kriclieldorff.
The annual roll-call of the Housewives’
Association gave a tally of 27,000 members.
Lately a few men have been admitted as
associate members. The business of ensuring
that necessities are sold at a fair price and
turned out to standard isn’t, after all,
entirely women’s work. The association
puts Australia first and Britain next in its
preferences. President Glencross has suc-
ceeded lately in securing for members a sub-
stantial discount for cash at certain shops,
and a drapery firm, an optician, a chemist,
a jeweller and others have been given the
right to say they are under the patronage of
the H.A. The association intends to battle
for the appointment of a woman to super-
vise kerb markets, and is still agitating to
have eggs branded with the date of birth.
A course in Social Science has once again
been arranged at the University at the
modest fee of 6s. for 24 lectures. Officers
have been re-elected without exception, a
sincere compliment to their zeal. The presi-
dent, thanking the members for their con-
fidence, informed them that she could only
hold her office for one more year, and advised
them to have a successor selected by next
annual gathering. Secretary Rachel Robin-
son came in for some very-well-earned praise.
Artist Francis Rossiter Crozier is being
cheerfully hailed by fellow-dabblers in art
after two years’ absence in U.S.A., where
he found an adequate market for his talents
as a commercial artist. A former student
of the National Gallery under the late Fred
McCubbin and Bernard Hall, he was a con-
temporary of Charles Wheeler and Bill Mc-
lnnes. He was later a private in the 6th
Brigade, and after service in Gallipoli and
France was appointed one of the war-record
artists. Some of his work will be shown
at the new gallery in Elizabetli-street this
month.
Bill Mclnnes has completed a portrait
of Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, a parting gift to the
lady from her friends and admirers. The
picture was handed over at the Lyceum
Club on a recent evening by Thomas Brent-
nail, who enumerated the Dyer couple’s good
deeds, especially in the realm of music, and
produced a paper-weight of opal for Mr.
Jimmy. Mr. Elderson Smith, another old
family friend, also said nice things. The
honored matron murmured her thanks in
soft pink chiffon peeping from beneath filmy
black lace. Millie Osmond, Victoria Ander-
son and Viola Morris warbled songs by
British composers to accompaniments played
by Ida Scott and Mrs. Hutton, and Claude
Hall told a story. Solicitor-General Garran
and his lady, artist Streeton’s wife, Dr.
Douglas Stewart and his life partner, Mrs.
E. Barnes and Erica Elderson Smith, who
hon. secretaried the presentation, Mrs. Fritz
Hart and lots more musical people were
there.
Robert Garran was at the Athenaeum
gallery to hearten up painters Miss A. M.
E. Bale and Jo Sweatman, who are holding
a combined show under Edith Smart’s man-
agement. Many fellow-artists attended, in-
cluded in the group being flower-painter
C. Hampel, whose portrait appears in Jo
Sweatman’s little lot. During the after-
noon there was a gratifying eruption of red
spots on the pictures.
A new sort of art show is being brewed
for about the middle of the year by the
Royal Victorian Institute of Architects,
which proposes to stage an “international
exhibition of architectural drawings.” The
idea seems to be to improve the Australian
taste, and most of the exhibits will come
from other countries, though Australian
sculptors and architects will be represented.
That is something to be thankful for.
Three maids in taffetas frocks of pastel
hues —pink, blue and mauve —their felt
hats dangling corresponding colored velvet
strings, attended Priscilla Marian, eldest
daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Gerald Weigall.
when she wedded Captain J. W. Hosgood at
All Saints’ Church, St. Kilda. The bride
had a train of old Venetian point attached
to deep ivory satin, and billows of white tulle
depended from her coiffure.
Dr. John Barnaby, elder son of a Haw-
thorn clergyman, has given a golden circlet
to Edna McCormack, second daughter of the
late J. W. McCormack, of Kyneton, whose
widow still lives thereabouts.
Late Justice Weigall's son Theyre Hamil-
ton kept an important appointment with
tin da Douglas, a daughter of Mr. M. D.
Harden, of Hove, in England, a few weeks
ago. The young couple will make their
home in England, at least for a while.
Admiral King-Hall’s daughter Olga Louisa
was married in the Cold Country to Alstair
McLeod, younger son of the late Colonel and
Mrs. McLeod, of Hampshire. At the recep-
tion Lady King-Hall received a swarm of
guests, well sprinkled with an Australian
element.
Little Judith Fleming Dixon, who was
christened during last week at St. James’s
old cathedral, is au Aussie of some lineage.
Three generations of her family before her
have done their marrying and christening
at St. James’s. An ancestress married one
Robert Fleming, and the name is perpetuated
in the area of land that embraces our famous
racecourse. Little Judith will not spend
her early days in her native city. The
family are moving to Sydney.
English-Speaking Unionists lined up at:
the club-room during the week to hear a dis-
course on “Color and Form in Modern Archi-
tecture,” by Rodney Alsop. Lately returned
With his wife from a tour in Egypt arid other
old lands, the speaker was able to talk of
house and town-planning from both ancient
and modern angles. The most memorable
thing he said was that Melbourne needed
more color. Tea was handed round during
the after-discussion, secretary Mrs. Richard
Gipps, Mrs. Watson Robertson and other
members of the Common Interests Com-
mittee being the ladies-in-waiting.
St. Vincent’s has followed the lead of
other public hospitals and founded a band
of women workers. At the first meeting
Philadelphia Robertson, of the _ Red Cross,
put forward some arguments in favor of
sailing under the crusading banner, and the
new body therefore lias affiliations both with
the Red' Cross and the hospital. Spurred
by the good example of the townsfolk,
many suburbanites promised to add branches
to the parent tree.. Mrs. Merson Cooper
was elected president. Mrs. Maurice
Macgillicuddy is hon. treasurer, and Mrs.
George Boucher, who called the meeting, is
hon. sec. pro tem. The Mayoress and the
Tallis ladv sent along promises of help. Dr.
Barry Thomson’s wife has consented, quit *
willingly, to be the entrepreneur of concerts
and that sort of thing.
Victoria Leaguers rallied round the tea-
tables at Menzies’ to drink a farewell brew
with Dr. T. Walker Sinclair’s dark-eyed lady,
who has secretaried the hospitality section
of the V.L. for the last two years, and has
been a member since 1915. A souvenir and
some blossoms were the guest’s portion
handed over with many wishes. She said
thanks in a black gown, with a coat ot
taffetas quilted with squirrel fur, and a black
hat enlivened with pink rosebuls. The Masson
lady, Mrs. J. S. Fraser and Mrs. Dunbar
Hooper were joint hostesses.
Dr. Georgina Sweet and barrister Flos
Greig—Flos is a sister of the two well-
known women doctors of Collins-strcet are
due here shortly after 18 months’ explora-
tion of Asiatic parts. They intend travel-
ling home overland from Broome.
Mrs. Elizabeth Apperly and a company of
amateurs heard the SOS sent out by . Mel-
bourne Hospital, and put on A. A. Milne’s
comedy “To Have the Honor” at the Play-
house to help the funds. The State Gov-
ernor’s wife attended in a glimmer of crystal
on an apricot background, and was accom-
panied by Mrs. R. E. Sliuter and Mrs. E. A.
S powers. Mrs. J. Beacham Kiddle was hon.
sec. of the show, and Marjorie Aitken kept
an eye on the treasury. Sales of flowers,
sweets and programmes helped to make
money.
The Lawn Tennis Association has arranged
a hop at the Kooyong club house on Satur-
day, May 7. Twenty officers of the Renown
have said “thank yon and we’ll be there”
to the invitation.

Built for any Jot
Plentiful power under the bonnet, with more in reserve than you
can ever use —brute strength when sand or mud grips your
wheels—speed for every occasion, with absolute safety—and the
extra kick that counts when conditions seem to have you
stumped.
These are the Republic qualities that account for 175,000 satis-
fied owners in all quarters of the globe—that make Republic
known as the “Truck to stand the gaff.”
They are the direct result of (1) a powerful engine, with a
rigid five-bearing crankshaft and the full pressure oiling system;
(2) drop-forged steel I-Beam rear axle, which takes all the load;
(3) separate driving axle enclosed in oil; (4) the drive-shaft
brake, the most highly-perfected truck braking system ever
developed; (5) the strongest, toughest, most sturdy frame that
money can buy; a combination of super features not found in
any other truck.
Ask your local agent to demonstrate Republic to you—he will
gladly do so, without obligation, at any time to suit you.

THE LITTLE SISTERS.
QUEENSLAND.
Brisbane.
Social life is holding its breath before
the plunge into Ducal festivities, and every-
body is clamoring for a good view of the
Duchess. Mayor Jolly is looking after the
disabled soldiers, and seats are being erected
for them in advantageous positions.
Brisbane is to have its busy days from
the 6th to the 12tli. The United Press will
fete the visiting journalists on the 9th. M.
L. Reading, president of the Press Institute,
will be in the chair, and his wife will play
hostess.
Letters from Sir Matthew Nathan say
he is having the Goodwins down to his
Somerset home for a long talk before they
leave for Bananaland. Both Governor and
A.D.C. are married men this time. Sir
Matthew says he is making selections from
his Queensland speeches for the book which
the City Council wishes to bring out. It
will be an interesting volume.
Meantime Toowoomba is indulging in its
auuual show. Many beautiful dahlias decked
the official luncheon table, where several
Brisbane people were present in addition to
the leading local lights, including Littleton
Groom and his lady, and Brigadier-General
and Mrs. J. C. Robinson.
Ascot races were remarkable, among
other things, for the number of winter felts
which arose like mushrooms on the lawn.
Mrs. W. H. Buchanan and Mrs. Danagher
gave afternoon teas on the committee room
verandah. Mrs. R. J. McNab, just hack
from Sydney, wore Burgundy crepe de Chine
and black hat, and Mrs. E. K. Tully had
a red hat with her frock in navy, red, and
huff crepe de chine. Mrs. Don Chauvel
wore amethyst, Mrs. Ladbury’s lace dress
was worn over pink, Kathleen Hirschfeld
was in pale pink, Mrs. J. E. Stewart in
elierry and white, Ina Brown in navy, and
Elma White in sliell-pink.
Mrs. Jackson, whose photo from the Trissie

Norman Craigie, of Sydney, only son of
the W. H. Craigies. of Brisbane, married
Marion Wilcox, of Toowoomba, in the Ncil-
street church. The bride played her part in
ivory taffetas and silver, carrying white
heather, roses and dahlias. Her sister
'maided in sunset-gold brocaded taffetas with
a bandeau of yellow tulle; the other stand-
by was Alison Craigie, in blue taffetas and
sold lace, with a bouquet of pink and yellow
dahlias. The reception was at the Alex-
andra, Mrs. Wilcox receiving in black mari-
ette.
Beethoven’s centenary was kept up in the
Albert Hall. Vada Jeffries, Edith Larwill,
Bwen de Grant and Mary Jeffries, with
Adeline College at the piano, played the
opening string quartette. Les Edye sang
four Beethoven songs, and Vada Jeffries and
Adeline College played the “Kreutzer.”
Mrs. George Munro, who died a few days ago
in Sydney, spent all her early married life in
Queensland. Her husband was a tall, hand-
some Scot —he sometimes wore the tam-
o’-slianter—who died in ’95, whereupon
bis widow came to live in Brisbane. She
'vas in her ninetieth year.
For Brisbane Golf Club’s opening day the
dub-rooms were decorated with Oriental-
hued dahlias. Members from other clubs
were there, and there were competitions and
tea.
The Paul Dowds, who had the energetic
notion of spending a honeymoon on a walk-
ing tour, arrived from Victoria and ambled
through our city.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
. Winter is icumen in, and with it some
signs of stirring from our social somnolence.
Mrs. Mortloek and Mrs. R. M. Hawker were
joint hostesses at the first private, dance of
the season, staging it at the former’s home
at North Adelaide, in a setting of scarlet
and gold (gaillardias and chrysanthemums),
with balloons and massed blue-gum in the
dance-room. Mrs. Mortloek was in befringed
and silvered black, and her sister, just back
from England, was all gold and iridescent
sequins.
, Polo tournaments have left Mount Craw-
ford B winners of the Melrose Cp and given
the R. M. Cudmore Cup to Mid-Norths.
Attendances mostly have been small, but
made up for it in enthusiasm. The Governor
spent the best part of an afternoon watching
the semi-finals. Tea hosts included Mr. Barr
omith on the day that his Cup fell to
Mount Crawford A.
. For the rest, there has been music pro-
vided by Conservatorium students at their
hrst concert of the season. Outstanding
numbers were Schutt’s F Minor Concerto by
Jean Norman and a ’cello ensemble for
which Mrs. Edgar Savage, Helena Harris
an d Geoffrey Goldsworthy were responsible.
There is a Mary Packer Harris exhibition
nf pictures at the Society of Arts rooms.
'' °°dcuts, sketches of the Bellchambers sanc-
tuury at Humbug Scrub and the address that
De League of Empire is to present to the
Uuke of York were things that caught the
eye.
The Gordon Law Smiths were among the
Cathay's passengers; and the Whitmore
Carrs, who have sold their Glenelg home to
the E. W. Morrises, sail in May. Other
shuffles of well-known properties have been
tlie sale of Mrs. Tolley’s house at Medindie
to Dr. Sangster, and of Quambi to the
Sisters of the Church to add to the property
of St. Peter’s School for Girls.
A tangible sign of Liberal rejoicing in the
elections is the present of a six months’
holiday to W. B. Page, the Federation’s
secretary, plus a cheque that will take him to
England. Director of Education McCoy,
also bound on a mission overseas, takes with
him his daughter, Mrs. Guy Beresford.
Dame Margaret Greville spent a couple of
days with the Governor and Lady Bridges
at Government House before joining the
Cathay for London.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
Back from six months of English climate,
Anita Fitz Gerald, full of energy and new
ideas, and with a tail of extra letters for
her brass-plate. She pursues the study of
drama and voice production, is Westralia’s
only A.R.C.M. and the first elocutionist in
Australia to obtain the F.T.C.L. As a pro-
ducer of plays she has often made us pop-
eyed.
There’s an exodus going on. Mrs. W.
Tivey is off to South Africa this week. Mrs.
.T. Learmonth‘and daughter Molly are having
little time between the numerous parties
given in their honor to pack their trunks
for England, and last week Mrs. Franklin,
in lavender-silk crepe, assisted by Mrs. Mat-
ters and Mrs. Woodroffe, decorated the
Mayoress’s suite for an afternoon farewell
to Mrs. Arthur Loton, who, with daughter
Jean and son Maurice sail for a year
in Europe. Mrs. Loton greeted her friends
in champagne georgette, and Jean smiled in
taffetas of dull-red.
The rain came down in inches on the
night of the W. A. Rowing Club dance, but
intrepid youth* and beauty braved it in
scores. Owing to the deluge even the wise
little misses in last year’s dance frocks
didn’t sit out in boats. The usual cars
sufficed, with the draughty club-rooms
dressed in the club colors of black and
white.
The first cabaret of the season opened
at the Piccadilly among a whirl of colored
streamers and balloons. Punkahs with
paper puff-balls of every hue qnd size sus-
pended from them made the hot night cooler,
while a good floor and Sheridan’s band
gave followers of the Charleston an induce-
ment to be energetic.
Chuhaldin with his violin has been delight-
ing Perth audiences. Two years ago, when
he visited this State for the first time,
and knew no English, he made the acquaint-
ance of Miss Annette Hillliouse, and later
secured her as his accompanist. Cupid
proved a wonderful stimulant, and Chuhal-
din soon progressed sufficiently to put the
all-important question in Nettie’s own
language. Since his translation of the
hoped-for answer, he has made rapid strides,
and during the party given in his honor by
the Green Room Club, Nettie proudly mur-
mured : “Listen to Alec airing his English.”
Miss Hillhouse. who is only 24, received her
musical education from the Frank Robert-
son couple, and will wed her Russian in
Perth in the near future.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
Hobart is working up to the right pitch
of excitement, and D’Arcy Addison is exer-
cising his well-known social gifts, chief of
which is remembering the right people.
The visitors’ books at Government House
and the Town Hall have been rushed
by feverish .eleventh-hour optimists, and the
Launceston aldermen are very annoyed be-
cause, though they stand at Tassie’s Front
Door, they are to see and talk to the Ducal
ambassadors for only a few hours.
D’Arcy Addison’s wife (you remember her
as knight John Downer’s widow) found time
to give an at-home in honor of her sister, Mrs.
Moser, who has taken a house here for the
next 12 months or so. It was a fine, warm
day, so summer frocks were donned once
more, and the pretty garden of the hostess’s
new residence at Sandy Bay was enhanced
by the addition of chiffons and sunshades in
every color. Mrs. Douglas Nettlefold sang
entraneingly above the chink of the tea-cups.
Several of the more sporting of our younger
set ran up to Campbelltown to be present at
the Hunt dinner and dance given as a fare-
well to the Master of the Midland Hunt Club
and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. J. N. Archer, of
Brambletye. The dinner was quite in the
old-fashioned sporting-banquet style, the hall
being decorated with hunting trophies, and
each guest was ceremoniously invited to take
a sip of wine from the gold cup won during
the year by Mr. Lai Field at the Oakland
Hunt Club Races.
An intriguing title—“ Eve’s Treasury”—and
dinky little invitation cards drew a crowd to
the Theatre Royal last week, when Berlei,
Limited, held a picturesque display of their
wares. _ Why doesn’t some enterprising firm
of men’s outfitters adopt the same plan and
hold the Pageant of Pyjamas, or Revelations
of Rupert? Checucchi’s orchestra played
delightfully, and Mrs. Lucy Atkins, in splen-
did voice, contributed two solos.
The at-home given by our Chief Justice’s
lady at the Queen Mary Club was a smart
affair, and the scheme of decoration, in
autumn tints, set off the hostess’s own russet
coloring and flowered georgette frock emi-
nently. Her two daughters helped her—
they were fresh and charming, as usual.
That versatile lady, Mrs. Lloyd Oldmeadow.
who has been made official delegate to Lon-
don from this State’s Victorian League, sailed
for England in the Ceramic on the third, and
was given a farewell at the Lyceum Club by
Mrs. Stourton the preceding day.
The furnishings of the Lyceum Club have
been added to by the gift of a clock in
memory of one of its first members, Mrs.
Gerald Bailey, who lost her life in an aircraft
accident in England a few years ago, when
on a visit to her daughter Olive, who married
Commander Brian Stevenson, R.N. The
clock is Mrs. Stevenson’s gift.

“Amity” : The poets who specialise in loyal
odes are looking worried, and well they may.
"Duchess” and “Princess” are practically
without rhymes, and those for either
"Prince” or “Duke” are a sorry collection.
"Since,” “wince,” “mince,” “quince” and
"rinse” are bad enough; “fluke,” “puke,”
“rebuke” and “peruke” are worse. And, as
for the words that click with York, what
could even a Browning do with “cork,”
“stork,” “fork” and “pork”?
"Spare Sub.”: Jack McLaren, the one
time Bulletin contributor who specialises
in South Sea and Torres Strait yarns, has
achieved a distinction rare in the case of
Australian writers. His book, “My Crowded
Solitude,” lias been republished in a German
edition, while other editions in French,
Italian and Danish are due shortly. Henry
Lawson has been done into French, and, I
believe, into Swedish; and some scores of
his Bulletin verses have been translated by
Professor Danes, and published at Prague, in
Czech o-Slovakia.
"L.T.”: The advertiser who wants to
prove a theological theory by means of texts
and has a buck at it whenever he can spare
the coin, is familiar to most newspapers.
But it isn’t often they buy half a page at
a time. Wellington (M.L.) Dominion found
such an enthusiast the other day, an ancient
person named_ Nield, who filled four columns
with an erudite treatise to prove that there
isn t going to be any Millennium. The work
ends up with an advertisement for books and
pamphlets on the subject, some of which,
according to the advertiser, are “patronised
by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales.” Now we
know why Teddy couldn’t come on this trip :
lies too busy studying theological treatises.
“P.X.”: The Brisbane Courier's ’plane
service (B. 24/3/’27) has a big flier which
was sent down to Sydney for the Duke’s
landing. The_ idea was to get photos and
hurry home with them, and the back journey
was actually done in 41ir. 48min., flying-
time. Incidentally, of course, the service
hunted for and brought a couple
down at £25 a head. One of them was James
Ldmond, of The Bulletin, who began to
get enthusiastic about flying when he was
bo, and has since then, besides minor flights,
winged almost half-way round the Australian
coast. His last flutter was a disappointment
m one respect—he has been wanting a long
non-stop flight, and the Brisbane-Byd 11 cy pro-
gramme promised it. But something went
wrong with the plans, and they had to drop
m at Grafton for petrol and repairs.
Rue Turbigo”: “Pollio,” after a few
months’ stay in France (B. 24/3/’27), gives
his view of French journalism and some
examples of its “astounding frankness”
which strikes him as so wholesome, coupled
with an assurance that he is not quoting
from gutter-rags. It would be interesting
to know what papers he was quoting from,
trench journalism can be, and often is,
brutally frank; but the coarseness and vul-
garity which “Pollio” finds so stimulating
is mostly confined to the gutter-press. The
french weapon has ever been the rapier—
not the bludgeon. The standard of, say, Le
Journal Des Debats, Le Temps, Le Matin,
Laulois, Figaro, Gil Blas and others I
could name is equal to that of any news-
paper in the world for dignity and restraint.
If "Pollio’s” collection of quotations need
sub-editing or bowdlerising for English con-
sumption, I doubt if he was reading repre-
sentative French journals.
“Hamer”: The “local correspondent” of
the city daily who spreads himself on coun-
cil meetings, police-court cases and pleasing
social functions, has got a set-back in a test
case on the question of holidays brought
against the Melbourne Age. His lot has
always been a somewhat joyless one because
he is expected to write about everything that
happens within his ken and to be content
with a few odd pars., savagely cut down,
getting into type. If there is anything big.
like a murder, in his district a regular-staff
man is sent out to do it. The A.J.A. fixed con-
ditions for the. correspondents in 1917; but
the Age immediately circularised all those on
its staff notifying them that their services
m the old capacity were no longer required,
f heir copy was still accepted, however, and
the retaining salaries still paid; and on this
basis most of them carried on. But the other
day a superseded local newsgatherer claimed
that he was entitled to compensation for
not receiving holidays, and Lukin, of the
Commonwealth Arbitration Court, ruled
that, under the terms of his relationship
TLo A pa P ( *’.. t 1 ,16 claim could not stand,
fhe A.J.A. is likely to have more to say on
me point in its next conference with the
newspaper proprietors.
TO A SPLIT INFINITIVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘‘The English-speaking world may be divided into
those who neither know nor care what a split
infinitive is, those who know and condemn, and those
who know and distinguish.”
Misjudged and wholly miserable form,
Looked down upon with scorn by the ped-
antic,
Tis strange that you should always raise
a storm
Of protest, driving critics nearly frantic.
Why is a writer looked at with suspicion
For separating verb and preposition?
Your introduction into verse or prose
By amateurs is definitely banned,
For any young, ambitious author knows
The captious critic might not understand
That, sometimes, it may be of benefit
To sunder things not usually split.
Although thus often left in solitude,
Be thankful you’re not wholly ostracised ;
By certain folk, it’s true, you are eschewed,
By others you are never recognised.
The treatment you receive from most is
lenient,
For, though not elegant, you are con-
venient.
So lose not courage, there is still a place
For you, providing authors with solutions
To many problems which they have to face.
You save them many awkward substitu-
tions.
The best of them attempt, at any rate,
To—wisely and with taste—discriminate.

The process of living up to his motor-car
brings Richard Burton to the verge of ruin
in Act I of “Six-Cylinder Love,” which
opened operations at Sydney Criterion Theatre
on Saturday. There is a sectional view of
a portion of Suburbia divided in middle
stage by a back fence. On one side of it
Mrs. Burton and her daughter try to dis-
guise the heavy weather that has overtaken
them from the stylish friends who have
helped it along; and Burton explains the
position to William Donroy, who sold him
the car and, incidentally, did himself a bad
turn —Phyllis, whom he adores, having lost
her head in the society of the flash friends
who have helped to spend her father’s money,
and no longer considering the motor-salesman
class enough. Burton’s troubles are over-
come by Donroy ingeniously selling the car
to the newly-wed Sterlings, who, up to then,
had been living a billing and cooing exist-
ence on the other side of the fence, to the
amusement of their neighbors. The car, a
highly-polished and attractive villain, admir-
ably played by a Chandler-six, brings the
expensive friends to the Sterling menage,
with the usual disastrous consequences.
Sterling goes further than Barton, by embez-
zling money—of course, with the best inten-
tions —in the fever of the new life, and loses
his job. But the two families, having learnt
an admirable lesson about the danger of
living beyond their means, and allowing other
people to spend their money, find their feet
and happiness again in cheap city flats,
where they are once again neighbors, fight-
ing their way back to solvency.
* * * *
It is refreshing to receive such a play
from America; without any pretensions to
literary flavor, the story is told with a
clean, crisp humor and delightful homely
touches. The droll character work of Richard
Taber as Gilbert Sterling, Mary Ellen Han-
ley as his wife Merrilyn, and Hale Norcross
as Burton, are the main ingredients in the
pudding of success. John Fernside makes
an admirable Donroy, his nervy habit of
quick-firing his lines suiting the part of the
motor salesman ; due weight and importance
are given to George Stapleton, Sterling’s
employer, by Frederick Forrester; and Adele
Crane as Margaret Rogers and Douglas
Vigors as her husband present a good pair
of snide stylish friends, although the theft
of the whisky when the social leeches are
turned out of the Sterlings’ house is an
overdrawn bit. As another of the social
parasites Claude Saunders is less successful;
his use of a stock phrase does not come
naturally. The other characters, with the
exception of the Mary of Daphne Bairn,
are colorless. The piece nevertheless, judged
by and large, looks a winner.

The music made by Paderewski continued
to draw vast audiences to the Town Hall till
last Tuesday night. This was the final
Sydney appearance of the G.O.M. of the
piano; and the enthusiasm of the audience
broke out in a cataclysm of sound that might
have been a farewell to royalty.
❖
On Saturday “Six-Cylinder Love” moves
over to the Palace Theatre, where the experi-
ment of running the Repertory production,
“The Old Adam,” for a fortnight (it ends
to-morrow night) has not proved the success
the play and the players deserve. Nellie
Stewart is to reintroduce “Sweet Nell of
Old Drury” at the Criterion on Saturday
for a fortnight only; and producer George
Parker is busy now rehearsing “The Cradle
Snatchers,” which is to occupy the Cri. on
April 23.
There is an abrupt termination of “Tell
Me More” at Sydney Royal this week;
the same company will transfer its atten-
tion to “The Cousin from Nowhere” on
Saturday night. The Gilbert and Sullivan
season is running to a close, too; “Pinafore”
reached its finish last night, “The Gondo-
liers” is being revived for a matinee and
night performance to-day; “The Mikado,”
with Strella Wilson in it, prevails to-morrow,
followed by the “Pirates of Penzance”
(Saturday, with matinee), “Yeomen of the
Guard” (Monday) and “lolanthe” (Tues-
day, with matinee). A matinee and night
performance on Wednesday will bring sun-
set ; Her Majesty’s audiences are voting on
the piece to be staged. On the next Satur-
day, Marie Burke, with “Frasquita,” will
be back at Her Majesty’s. “Sunny” is con-
tinuing its bright career at the Empire; and
“The Nervous Wreck” still suffices at the
Grand Opera House. “Charley’s Aunt” is
not booked to raise laughs at that address
until Easter Saturday.
On Saturday Stiffy and Mo kept the
crowded audience at Fullers’ Theatre in a
roar of hilarity with matter which had few
objectionable features ; the stuff that calls for
managerial interference appears to creep in
on some of the week nights, in an endeavor
to play up to a section of the audience
that least deserves consideration. The pair
are good enough comedians to do without
stuff of this sort; and the management should
insist that they shall do without it.
Tom Kelly took only a couple of minutes
to make himself at home at the Tivoli last
Monday; fourteen years’ absence has not
dimmed his popularity. He does his turn
in dress clothes with nothing grotesque in
his make-up except the mouth that God has
given him ; consummate drollery and a solid,
clear voice give all the point needful to his
yarns and songs, though for at least one
item a substitute might be found. There is
an f.a.q. programme allied with his turn,
with the humors of “The Jovers” and the
dancing of the Cansinos, in the intervals
between whose strenuous exercises Byrl
Walkley sings very nicely.
** # *
The direct descendant of the show
with which Roman emperors regaled their
subjects maintains its spell at Wirths’
Hippodrome six times a week and on
matinees. There are performing lions on
the programme, but it is the bears who still
remain the lions of the performance, so to
speak, in spite of the arrival of a new turn
of child acrobats; and, sometimes, when the
older acrobats are at work, the shrill, small
voice of a child can be heard asking aunty
whether she can do that.
“THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WANTED,”
AT MELBOURNE KING’S.
Tony (Maurice Moscovitch) spends his wed-
ding eve in bed with a pair of broken
legs. Amy, his flapper wife (Ellen Pol-
lock).
The Playbox Theatre has got back to
“Business Is Business.” Octave Mirbeau’s
satiric comedy opened the fourth year of this
amazing little organisation in Rowe-street,
Sydney, last week. Just why Duncan
Macdougall selected this obviously “well-
made” play, and also why-he chose the part
of the gross, huge, piratical, modern business-
man, is a Rowe-street mystery. Faked rolls
of fat on his neck and a detachable “tummy”
failed to give the illusion of tremendous
stature and girth. The play hits the busi-
ness man of to-day—a type not peculiar to
France —with biting ferocity, but it seems
rather a pity that the ending of disaster is
foreseen long before the curtain falls. Lechat
was played by Macdougall with vigor and
flashes of brilliance, despite his lack of inches
and his habit of losing his lines in mutter-
in gs. R. Ivan Mitchell made a delightful
shady commission agent; Roland Berrill
gave a clever picture of the box-ed son of the
financier; Florence Whyte, as the long-
suffering wife, was forceful; but the part
of the daughter, played by Judy Watson, was
colorless. Anybody who wants a new theat-
rical sensation should attend one of the
regular Wednesday-evening performances.
It is saddening, after all the talk of the
triumphant revival of the British film indus-
try, that such a poor transcript of “The
Only Way,” the film adaptation of Dickens’s
“Tale of Two Cities,” should be brought
overseas. Sir John Martin Harvey, who has
been appearing in this stage play for many
years, realistically presents the famous Sid-
ney Carton on the screen; but the picture
is utterly unworthy of Dickens, the film
fiends having made of it something that but
faintly recalls the novel, with characters
changed out of recognition. Even the sin-
ister figure of Madame Defarge, with her
fateful knitting-needles, has been omitted.
The play is to be seen at the Lyceum and
the Haymarket.
THE SYDNEY REPERTORY THEATRE
SOCIETY IN “THE OLD ADAM”
AT SYDNEY PALACE.
Albert Collins as Admiral Joe Bunting, and
8. It. Irving as General Cunliffe.
Amongst the water-colorists :
A fairly even show at the N.S.W. Education Depart-
ment’s Gallery suffers through the smallness of the
contributions of some leading Australian artists who
are usually well in evidence; also, there is no cha :m
in the work of several contributions bv English water-
colorists. Blamire Young has seven pictures in his
usually imaginative style, but they are all smallish;
B. E. Minns stands out with a view of “Barington
Valley, North Coast,” and some exquisite work in
“Hydrangeas,” and the weird style of Kenneth Mac-
queen shows to real effectiveness in “Five-Mile
Creek,” whatever can be said about his others. R.
Sturgess is too imitative to count for much. There is
some attractive work by C. E. S. Tindall, Albert
Collins (whose “Princes Bridge” is particularlj
noticeable), R. Fizzle and A. H. Full wood ; John
D. Moore, as usual heavy in style, does well with a
mountain landscape; Harold Herbert’s contribution
is smaller and less distinguished than usual. “Le
Pont Neuf, Toulouse,” by Jessie Traill, is one of
the pictures that catch the eye amongst a multi-
tude that will make nice wall decorations.
❖ ■* ❖ H*
Tea-time Art:—
One has an impression that Miss Pearl Sheldon,
an exhibition of whose paintings is open at the
Fine Arts Gallery, King-street, is a lady who sacri-
fices tea-parties to chase the fine lights of afternoon
and evening. The artist has just returned from five
years in Europe, and the result is a multitude of
pictures in which the soft mellow tones of slanting
light and deep shadows are shown delicately and
without straining for effect, There is a note of
quiet composure; work for the day is done, and
dinner will be ready shortly, if it is not already
waiting. “A Canal in Venice” and “Midsummer
Night, Kirkcudbright,” attract most attention;
amongst the few ’that get away from the tea-
time suggestion “Morning Sunlight” deserves a
word.
On previous occasions the present Show-
man lias thoroughly enjoyed the robust
Wilkspcarean rendering of “Macbeth,” but he
found last week’s repetition at Melbourne
Princess a sour mess on his palate. In the
sombre atmosphere of this tragedy the worst
faults of the present company showed up
in sharp relief. The Wilkie Macbeth was
an even more deafening uproar than usual,
and, while urging her husband to aspire to
a higher position in the Scottish Civil Ser-
vice, Mrs. Macbeth (Miss Hunter-Watts)
was little more than a series of elocutionary
explosions, though she calmed down suffi-
ciently for the hand-washing episode, to thrill
her hearers. John Cairns delivered the lines
allotted to Macduff in the tone of an im-
prisoned miner shouting for assistance. Wil-
liam Lockhart made little of the Hcll’s-
gate scene, and the graceful Dennis Barry
was successfully obscured in the rags and
uncouth gambollings of the second witch.
The action proceeded rapidly and noisily
in a green Scotch mist of tragedy so dense
as to throw heavy strains upon the strongest
eyesight. If a Scandinavian seaman had
wandered in he might easily have imagined
himself in the intestines of a whale, listening
to the processes of cetacean indigestion.
As an antidote to witches and Scottish
assassination, Wilkie last week administered
three doses of “As You Like It,” giving his
own vocal organs a badly-needed rest in the
part of the melancholy Jacques. Ills com-
parative effacement threw into pleasant re-
lief the wholesome work of Dennis Barry,
who, as Orlando, gave a fresh grace and
interest to Sliakspearean amour. Portia's
garden at Belmont, after a brief trip to
Illyria in the service of Olivia, returned to
duty as the ducal demesne in Arden. Dulcie
Cherry realised her part of Celia and did
not forget it when she was not talking.
Youthful charm was represented very toler-
ably by Miss Hunter-Watts, and Vincent
Scully, as the venerable Adam, was all senile
fidelity and even a trifle over. Milton Sands,
as the Duke’s wrestler, allowed himself to
be scandalously easily overcome by a mere
chip of an antagonist in a contest that would
have got the bird in any self-respecting
stadium.

Judith Anderson, Leon Gordon and Wallis
Clark gathered round the table at Melbourne
Royal on Saturday when “Tea for Three”
was served. Miss Anderson, as the woman
whose husband is obliged to feed her with
homoeopathic doses of her lover in order to
save her from Sin’s hot infection, topdressed
the seemingly hard macadam of her tempera-
ment with theatrically effective jiirs and
graces, but the rather commonplace sensu-
ality of the lady’s style, expressed in volup-
tuous reclinings on cushioned couches and
frequent exhibition of details of her dorsal
anatomy, appeared to be aimed less at her
fellow workers on the stage than the bald-
heads in the stalls. Still, the spectacle was
gratefully received and Leon Gordon, as the
unusual libertine, content once a week to
sniff without tasting the dish of forbidden
love, got frequent plaudits for a sound dis-
play of histrionic intelligence. As the
accommodating husband, Wallis Clark corru-
gated his brows through the three acts in
a consistent ecstasy of marital imbecility.
“They Knew What They Wanted” at
Melbourne King’s is a sadly-neglected enter-
tainment these days. The first night went
off: with no more fizz than a leaky soda
siphon, and a lot of habitual playgoers went
home and told their friends it was repertory
stuff and had a pair of broken legs in it
and other unnatural disadvantages. Yet it
isn’t such a bad play and Moscovitch makes
it seem even better. Such is the vanity of
human hopes, however, that “The Fake,” by
Frederick Lonsdale, will replace it on Satur-
day.

The front stalls at Melbourne Tivoli are
not so popular as upual, owing to an annoy-
ing person on a swing who flings himself
about with seeming recklessness while oscil-
lating half-way across the auditorium. Olsen
and Johnson, the American comedians, re-
turned on Monday, and made no attempt to
conceal the fact that they had performed
before royalty in Sydney. Gerardo and
Adair are engaged in a dance after Pavlova
—and a long way after, too; and there is a
clog-dancer who is as tedious as a trans-
continental railway journey. But Frederick
Sylvester is worthy of consideration. He is
equipped .with three “nephews” capable at
any moment of _ turning themselves into
graven images which can be lifted about by
an arm or leg, precisely as if they were
ornamental bric-a-brac.

The Beethoven centenary passed off quietly
in Melbourne. Some vague remarks by
Fritz Hart incited the British Musical
Society to the three days’ festival at the
Assembly Hall, and Bertha Jorgensen, Hope
Scott, Dorothy Roxburgh and Tasma Tier-
nan dealt more or less justly with the Opus
18 (No. 4) quartette, but did not wake up
thoroughly until the last two movements,
when the frequent breaking of a string of
one young lady’s instrument introduced smme
new notes into the composer’s score. Rita
Hope played a sonata on the piano, but the
star performances of the session were vocal.
Colin Thomson singing “Adelaide” with
throaty feeling and Jessie McMichael giving
fretful and passionate utterance to the "A
Qual Furor” aria from “Fidelio.” Edward
Goll gave a pianoforte recital of some well-
known pieces. The cat which assisted Perci
Grainger in his concerts at the Auditorium
moved across to the Assembly Hall during
the week and joined in the celebrations.
Otherwise Melbourne failed to justify its
claim to being the musical Mecca of the
universe.

The film version of the Coronation of the
Pope at Melbourne Olympia was a pale
shadow of the ornate original. It was on .
dimly seen through a mist of Italian uni-
forms, poor nhotography and main ere
lighting. But the enthusiasm of the audi-
ence, mainly juvenile, was great; and when-
ever an Australian bishop entangled in
Roman palace anneared upon the screen, i
was simply deafening.

Walter Kirby’s golden voice will tell the

Auditorium on Good Friday afternoon and
evening. The vast and tawdry interior of
the Exhibition will be glorified by the Mel-
bourne Philharmonic Choir, assisted by Ray-
mond Ellis, of the British Opera Co., sing-
ing the “Elijah” oratorio. In the meantime
“Rose Marie” at His Majesty’s, “The Ghost
Train” at the Athenaeum, and “Gum-tree
Gully” at the Palace continue to give delight
to pagans. There is no truth in the rumor
that Phil Smith’s new reveue at the Bijou,
“Mary’s Lamb,” is an Australian version of
the passion-play of Oberammergau.
❖ * *
Impressionism tempered by discretion is
11. B. Harrison’s method in landscape, judg-
ing by his show of oils at the New Gallery,
Melbourne. Heidelberg, with its spacious
paddocks, cows and horses fattened by the
willow-logged Yarra, is his favorite stamp-
ing ground. A rougli-and-readiness about the
textures of his surfaces is sometimes notice-
able, but he handles sunshine with exuber-
ance and catches the silvery grey glimmer of
the stubble hillsides pleasantly. The animal
standing for its portrait in No. 10 hasn’t
the quality of horseflesh, but the condition
of the pony in No. 4 would satisfy a vet.
There are several stylish portraits in this
show and two that are delightful. A saucy,
laughing lady is wrapped up in “The Plaid
Shawl” (No. 31), and the variety and
liveliness of the lighting in No. 11 make
“Madame D.” a very personable creature.
A fresh Melbourne outbreak: —
Miss A. M. E. Bale paints flowers with rare
appreciation, landscape with caution and human
beings with familiarity bordering on contempt.
Miss Jo Sweatman considers Truth is none the worse
for having its lips rouged and its nose powderea.
The two ladies have been showing oils at Melbourne
Athenasum which exhibit little advance on then-
work of last year.
The Sedon Galleries are displaying oils, waters
and etchings bv Sydney artists, including N. Lindsay,
Gruner, John D. Moore, Robert Waden and W. R.
Johnson. Those that are new are not particularly
noteworthy.
It is a curious fact that Colin Colahan’s pen and
ink drawings ’ published in The Bulletin give more
effect of color than the paintings he has been hang-
ing in the Salon d’Automne and suchlike European
mausolea. When the present commentator last
drifted through the above-mentioned art museum the
sensations he experienced in no way differed from
those he had felt the previous day during a visit to
the Paris morgue. The prevailing flight from reality
which is characteristic of modern French art is
perfectly reflected in the show at the Fine Art
Gallery. Colahan has some feeling for large
simplicity, but before he begins to paint he tips
his landscapes up and carefully pours the color out
of them. In only one picture, and that the most-
pleasing, has he deigned to acknowledge the existence
of the sun. His composition is deliberately crude,
and suggests an endless panorama chopped into
handy sections. His foliage is dead stuff left over
from a Harvest thanksgiving and dipped into green
paint to cheer it up. A big lumpy nude priced at
500 guineas demonstrates that he has a nice eye for
flesh as flesh, but a shy one for abstract beauty.
One or two of the pictures, highly-priced and titled
in a foreign language, appear to be such consciously
infantile smearings that the present writer suspects
the artist of an irreverent attempt at legpull. Just
to confound the critics, however, Colahan in two
interesting studies has painted himself and his wife
as warm human beings, instead of exercises in
simple theory.

The Renee Kelly company opened at the
Adelaide Royal on Saturday night in “The
Last of Mrs. Clieyney,” and, the lady’s reputa-
tion having preceded her, there was a packed
house. In several instances there was a
gasp before a laugh, but the play has caught
on, and the season promises well. Emma
Temple has firmly established herself as
a favorite with one sex; the other is thrilled
by Alexander Onslow and the frocks worn
at the Charity concert. “Brown Sugar”
followed on April 2. William Anderson is
busy reviving J. C. Williamson’s successful
evergreens, and this week “Within the Law”
is getting good support. Hilda Dorrington
lias brought new blood into Anderson produc-
tions. At the York Theatre, in “The Wan-
ing Sex,” Nina Duane demonstrates that
modern woman can beat man when it comes
to brains. The Wondergraph is provid-
ing object-lessons in train-wrecking, with
11. B. Warner as the noble detective who
wins through without shedding a drop of
blood. At the Majestic Theatre “The Lady
Buccaneers,” by F. Gayle Wyer’s Band-box
Revue Company, is well above the average
both in singing and ballet work. Lorna
Lance and Co. are another good combina-
tion, while Leeds and Le-Mar and the Phil-
lip Sisters hold their own. Pauline Fred-
erick engages the screen at the Grand
Theatre in “The Glory of Clementina,” with
n supporting film of hair-raising properties
'Paling with the exploits of pirates in “A
Gaptain’s Courage.”

Point
“Caisar’s Ghost” : Royal visits are no good
to the theatrical business. With the excep-
tion of the Gilbert and Sullivan show, which
has given the Williamson management one of
the magnificent surprises of its long life,
Sydney amusements have felt the competition
of the Duke and Duchess and the pull of
the free shows outside —the city illumina-
tions and the chance of seeing royalty pass-
ing through the streets. The year has been
a remarkably good one for the vendors of
amusement; it is a curious irony that a
period of carnival should produce the first
bald patch.
“Lud”: E. J. Carroll has lately taken
a new partner in London —Harry Cohen,
sometime of Dunedin, who has struck oil
with “The Ghost Train,” and struck >'f rHi.
Carroll and Cohen are responsible for
Pauline Frederick’s appearance at the Lon-
don Lyceum ; and they have other theatrical
goods to cheer the Cockneys.
HE HAD HIS LIMITATIONS.
“That manager of yours seems to have a
great name as a producer. Nothing seems
to he beyond him.”
“Yes, he’s not had. There’s only one piece
of producing that beats him.”
“What’s that?”
“Our salaries.”
“Peter Pan” : It is not often that a show
comes to a Williamson theatre after a
previous presentation at the Newtown (Syd-
ney) Majestic, but such is the case with
“Six-Cylinder Love,” now at the Sydney Cri.
Frank Neil secured the thing from Ward
and did a week with it at Newtown a year
ago; also in Perth last September. Now it
is being presented as a J. C. Williamson
attraction “by arrangement with Ben and
John Fuller.”
“Flaming Youth”: The Sydney stage at
present holds one mummer who does very
well in rough parts but fails when he is
called upon to play a part that requires
good English. In one of these, as a baronet-
father, he one night tore open the usual tele-
gram and exclaimed: “Good ’Eavens . I here s
been a haccident.” Promptly came the
galieryite’s comment: “Yes, it appenea to
the liaitch!”
“N.K.C.”: The film called “The Woman
Pays” (B. 24/3/’27) was shown in Mel-
bourne in 1916 or ’l7. It was excellently
staged and acted. The story was of a young
station-owner whose sister is betrayed by
a city man. He goes to the city, meets pur-
posely the seducer’s sister, and seduces her.
The ending is, however, happy. The Mel-
bourne Cup was a feature of the film, also
an excellently-filmed thunderstorm. About
the same time another Australian film was
shown, a ghastly thing called “The Red
Plague.” One play apparently damned the
other.
“Caul Boy” : She
had brought her
small daughter to
see “Measure for
Measure” because
Shakespeare was
so educative, you
know, but as the
story of Vienna’s
underworld unfold-
ed itself, she grew
restless. By the
lime the first inter-
val arrived she had
determined to save
the young mind
from further con-
tamination and
started to drag her
to the exit. “But,
mummy,” said the
infant, “I want to
stay and see the
rest. I want to
know why Angelo
destroyed all the
boarding-houses!”
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Australia did not see
Edward Lloyd, the tenor, who has just died,
at 82, until years after he had taken his
farewell of English audiences. J. C. William-
son brought him here in 1903, but the voice
was not as great as it had been, and Aus-
tralia added little to his large fortune. As
a boy Lloyd sang in the Westminster Abbey
Choir. His three chums were Arthur Sulli-
van, John Stainer and Albert Cellier.
“Mars” : Gone where the' ghost walks every
day, Herbert Myers, manager of Adelaide
Theatre Royal ' for a quarter of a century.
Myers knew every mummer in Australia
and treated ’em all with terseness, from
Pavlova down to the most lowly member of
the chorus. -But though abrupt in manner
he was well liked. A very sick man for the
past 12 months, he had to abandon a
proposed world-tour with George Tallis. He
was only 47 at the finish.
“Mars”: C. R. Stanford has passed on.
Playing the part of Edward Gilger in
“Within the Law” at the Prince of Wales,
Adelaide, he was stricken with illness, but
insisted upon continuing. He collapsed after
the curtain-fall, and death followed in a few
days. Stanford was associated with George
Rignold, after which he was producer for
the Firm and Fullers’. He took his own
companies to Westralia and also toured N.Q.
He was a good fellow, and always a friend
to mummers down on their luck.
“Hamfat”: Although cheated by unfitness
of the warm welcome prepared fop him had
he been able to appear at the Sydney Royal
on Saturday in “The Cousin from Nowhere,”
Warde Morgan is due to get it soon. His
case is certainly unique. Coming out of the
Aberdeen (N.S.W.) train smash so badly
hurt that for days his death was expected,
he was pieced together by the doctors, but
they gave him a life sentence as a cripple.
Now, less than a year after the accident, he
is coming back to the stage. With infinite
patience and endurance of pain he has fought
a battle that commands admiration. The
“Christian Scientists,” a strong cult in the
profession, are claiming a great victory.
“Curtain-raiser”: Melbourne Argus got
itself into a sad impasse the other day over
its dramatic criticism. The young man who
went to “They Knew What They Wanted”
recorded the shock to his nerves in three-
quarters of a column of hushed protest that
a play with such a theme should be pre-
sented on the stage. The one who attended
to “Measure for Measure” applauded Sliaks-
peare for his courageous attack on an import-
ant social problem. Both plays deal with
the same obstetrical theme, the Bard’s being
the more gross in expression and unsatisfac-
tory in its solution. The Argus’s philosophy,
apparently, is that it is indecent to discuss
social problems until they are 300 years old.
“Irving Phelps” : Nobody appears to have
noticed that Norman Campbell’s version of
Lord Jeffreys in the recent Melbourne
revival of “Sweet Nell of Old Drury” was
facially and vocally reminiscent of J. B.
Atholwood. If I did not know that Camp-
bell preferred his own readings of characters,
I should say that his idea of Jeffreys w-as
a subtly-contrived burlesque of the older
mummer. Except for the fact that Campbell
did not reproduce Atholwood’s peculiar stoop,
it might have been Jimmy housing his intel-
lect under the Judge’s heavy brown wig.
But the excellent Atholwood is not permitted
to undertake such a succulent job as Jeffreys.
His talent is allowed a little freedom, but
it mustn’t go far —say, in minor, two-line
parts, of which his Chink in “They Knew
What They Wanted,” at thd Melbourne
King’s, is a most uneloquent example.
“A.G.M.” (Loud.) : The house could have
been sold out several times over for Pauline
Frederick’s London debut in “Madame X":
and Pauline had a great time. Her reception
was such that for some minutes after her
first entry she could not control her voice.
And after the final curtain the lady was so
overcome by the enthusiasm that she had to
be supported by two of the actors. All she
the man who out snored the saxophone.
could say were a few words of thanks and
even these were sobbed out rather than
spoken, and were punctuated by fervid inter-
jections from the gallery. On leaving, the
Daily Express man saw the stage door
“impassable with devotees and impossible
with hysteria.” Which all shows that even
the Cockneys are crazy about American
picture-actresses.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The faithful John Lem-
mone is again tootling the flute for Melba
at her concerts. As well as playing that
instrument, he has managed all the Dame’s
tours. He got into the way of' managing
when his concert party, which included
Marie Narelle, regularly toured Australia.
On one occasion, when John was making his
way to Sydney, a genial priest, with a deter-
mination to be affable, invaded the com-
partment at Goulburn and nodded to the
flautist. “You must excuse me, sir,” he
said, “your face is familiar to me, but I
can’t be after remembering where it was 1
met you.” “My name’s Lemmone,” said the
amused John. “I’m managing ' the Melba
tour.” The priest’s big hand came out for a
grip. “Why, there now!” he exclaimed. "1
knew that I knew ye! How do you do, Mr.
Maloney !”
“Eocali” : It is often said that Australian
publishers have no time for their country s
musical compositions. This is a slander on
men who have sunk thousands in publishing
Australian compositions. The list is growing
quite long. I pick my “Australian Eleven :
‘‘Break, Break, Break.” Louis Lavater ; ‘But-
terflies and Lilac,” Clifton Boanas; “Daffodils
in My Garden,” Clifton Boanas; “Gentlemen,
the King,” Horace Gleeson ; “God Be with
You,” Maggie Menzies Emblad; ‘ Ilome-
love,” Horace Richardson; “Persian Love-
Song,” Mona Mcßurney; “Queen’s Fifteen.
Rev. Canon Wheeler; “Remember Me No
More,” Gov. Robinson; “That’s All, May
Brahe; “To a Miniature,” May Brahe—but
there are hundreds of others.
“Up Stage” : In Wilkie’s newspaper adver-
tising no mention is made of the author. To
the contemporary flapper and cockerel
“Antony and Cleopatra” might be a new
sheik drama with an “alluring love-story,
“bacchanalian revels,” “Roman armor. ‘ mag-
nificent Eastern costumes,” and the like, cer-
tainly lie’s dead ; still it seems only a fair
thing to mention that one Will Shakspeai n
wrote the thing.
“Flaming Youth”: Jack F’anning, who be-
came a power in M.L. as a theatrical front-
of-the-house man, was expected to return
to Coates’s Islands with “The Best Peop e.
but decided to stay in Australia. Jack lias
been 50 years in the business. Even from
his birth he had stage associations • he was
horn in a house behind the old Princes,
Theatre in Melbourne. In the course of bis
long life he has handled entertainment pro-
positions ranging from musical stars am
Shakspearean companies down to tr&w
shows. Adelaide got its first sight of tw
pitchers” as a full show- when Fanning to

THE STAGE-DOOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It's hidden in an alley blind
And rather difficult to find;
For strangers it is not designed,
And there’s a Cerberus behind.
It leads to fortune and to fame.
Like dazzled moths into the flame
voung neophytes once shyly came
Whom now the public proudly claim.
And they who* slip inside that door
Will find their journey long and sore;
A few may hear the circle roar
And from the stalls the plaudits pour.
But one who won both fame and gold,
Whose name around the great world rolled,
By critics and the mob extolled.
Is now a cleaner, very old.
When you to that grim doorway go
With eager heart and eyes aglow:
That doorman grim—how could you know? —
Was once a famous Romeo!

The Bay-front.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A LL day long on yonder bay-front
Gulls have gathered, thither drawn
From long beaches and rock ledges
Since through drooping slie-oak tresses
Gleamed the gold of dewy dawn;
Seeking what the good sea sends them.
What the ripples inward bear —
Tossing flotsam, drifting flotsam—
Silver-pinioned, screaming, crowding,
Flock and flock have gathered there.
Restless always, ever noisy,
Through the air they dive and glide,
Keen of vision, quick of motion,
Watchers of the rising waters,
Watchers of the falling tide.
AVe that are not sea-bound creatures,
Dwelling on the land from birth
Till we fall asleep for ever,
Gather harvests, gather vintage,
From the lap of Mother Earth.
On the land we have our being,
AVake and slumber, dream and toil,
Grieving sometimes, sometimes mirthful;
Linked are we to her by ages,
Fed by sun and rain and soil.
Riches hidden in her bosom
AVe have learnt to see and seize—
Still are seeing, still are seizing—-
Plough and sickle we have fashioned,
But the sea-thiugs know not these.
Hers the giving, ours the taking,
Hers the bounty, ours the need;
Teeming o’er her spacious acres,
Many folk are hers to nurture,
Many mouths has she to feed.
Flying over azure spaces,
Coiled in caverns, cold and deep,
Clamped to walls of rock and coral,
Many lives, too, has the ocean—
Finned and winged and shelled —to keep.
Known to man, or still unvisioned,
On her floors of ooze and weed,
In her tides or tideless spaces,
Many folk are hers to nurture,
Many mouths has she to feed.
Though they lurk in quiet places,
Though they dwell where waves are
hurled,
Mindful is she of her charges ;
Twice a day with rich refreshment
Roll her tides around the world.
All day long on yonder bay-front
Gulls have gathered since the morn
A lade the ripples golden ripples,
All together, silver-pinioned,
Seeking flotsam landward borne.
All day long....and now at sunset,
Flock and flock, they homeward hie
Over beach and bay and headland,
O’er dune and cliff and river,
Rosy tinted ’neath the sky.

RODERIC QUINN.
Red Geraniums.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
NEXT to himself Chook Murty was
fondest of his wife Annie. Next to
Chook, Annie loved her red ger-
aniums. There was, although she herself
did not perceive it, some slight resemblance
between her husband and her plants. Both
were scarlet-faced and weedy, and continu-
ally demanding attention. Both lay warmly
at the core of Annie’s heart, irrespective of
the fact that, whereas the one gave out a
faint, sweet emanation, pitifully akin to
the fragrance of a garden, the other exhaled
robustly of stale beer and tobacco. And
both went their ways crookedly.
Annie Murty was a little woman. She
had shining black hair that spun itself into
a froth at her temples. Her eyes were
black, and her mouth was quiet. When she
smiled, which was seldom, she was almost
pretty. When she looked at Chook or the
geraniums, her eyes and her mouth were
beyond all question beautiful. These fea-
tures were—if such things may truly be—
index of Annie’s soul. In them one, as it
were, reached beyond heredity and environ-
ment to the savor of all things clean. Per-
haps this savor was the more sustained
because of Annie Murty’s knowledge that
a mother she might not be. Without hurt
she could look back to her one brief but
agonising essay in the kindly ward of the
Salvation Army Lying-in Hospital, with its
weak longing to join the tiny, still-born
clay hurriedly returned into the womb of
Eternity, its immense regret and self-pity,
its aftermath of empty baby clothes and
cheap trinkets so pathetically garnered
against the day that was not, and now
never could be. The mother-love in Annie
had reached blindly for the things that were
—Chook and the red geraniums.
The geraniums had been the gift of the
Army sister. Their scarlet finery cheered
Annie’s convalescing eye. They made such
brave showing against the white walls of
the ward—like health beginning to bloom
upon a wasted cheek—that Annie’s heart
went out to them. She carried the faded
stalks back with her to No. 3 Ulster-terrace,
with a large brown-paper bag of soil from
the plot fronting the hospital. The only
soil in Ulster-terrace was that which clung,
within and without, to the corroded brick
walls that once sheltered an early colonial
aristocracy. The scanty back yards were
paved with bricks also. The dust of their
disintegration lay, thickly over all, as
though blushing darkly at the drunken sag
of roof and chimney-pot. No cool, clean
shadow of earth showed anywhere.
Annie made a window-box of broken
cases and set it on the ledge of her bed-
room. With prayers and water she came
in due season to the triumph of securely-
rooted blooms. The consummation had in
it something of recompense for that other
miracle of her body’s planting, that neither
prayers nor tears had availed to save. From
the green, full-swelling buds Annie drew
exquisite happiness. She crooned oyer
them, scarcely conscious of Chook’s gaping
disgust. In Chook’s eyes the red gei’aniums
were merely weeds. Annie was batty—slob-
bering over a boxful of damned vegetables.
Strike him fat, she’d gone soft in the head
over losing her kid.
Chook himself, going about his unlawful
occasions, found no reason for l’egret.
Children, as he viewed them, were but
nxouths to feed and bodies to clothe. They
tied a man down. Ulster-terrace had more
kids already than the cracked footpaths
could find room for. Chook wasn’t iri l’egu-
lar work, so he had time to notice a lot
that was going on. Sometimes he brought
money into the house, and sometimes he
didn’t. But he always expected a full meal.
And he spat on the geraniums when Annie
wasn’t looking.
Annie used to wonder now and then why
Chook absented himself for days at a time.
She didn’t mind the loneliness of it so
much as the fact that Chook never con-
descended to explain what he had been
doing. She never questioned him. Annie
hated a woman to nag—to knock a man
about with her tongue. It was on a par
with a man who knocked a woman about
with his fists. Chook didn’t do that, any-
way; at least, not very often. Men weren’t
themselves when the drink was in them.
During these periods of isolation Annie
kept the pot boiling as best she could. She
was clever with her needle, and took in a
little white-work here and there when she
could get it. Since the episode of the baby
she had not been strong. As a charwoman
she was a dismal failure. The constant
stooping hurt her back and took away her
breath. She was become frail and tired.
She liked best to sew on the narrow veran-
dah, lifting her eyes now and then to rest
them on the friendly red of the geraniums,
and listening mechanically for Chook’s step
along the creaking passage.
He had been absent now for over a week.
Annie was feeling a little frightened lest
some ill had befallen him. As she sat stitching
she tried to think what it might be. Chook’s
manner of late had grown daily more irrit-
able and mysterious. There was something
furtive in his comings and goings that dis-
tressed her. He looked—Annie searched for
the word, and found it, unhappily—he
looked guilty. As if he’d been doing some-,
thing wrong. And Annie hated wrong. She
held herself apart as much as she could
from the indecencies of Ulster-teri’ace. She
shrank from the crafty atmosphere of the
quarter, with its sinister police record, its
intemperance, its eternal vendettas between
the Maltese and Italian colonies of West
and North Melbourne.
Two men came slowly down the street
in the odorous dusk. It seemed to Annie
that their brief glance towards her held
something of threat. For a second she had
the impression that they were turning in
at the rusted iron gate, but they passed on,
talking in an undertone. Annie’s heart
gave a sick beat or two. She had recog-
nised them as plain-clothes men, and an
immense pity pervaded her for the object
of their quest. It was so easy to go wrong
in a place like Ulster-terrace. And it wasn’t
the man —whoever he was—the police were
seeking that must suffer most, even if they
caught him. That was the hard part of it.
The law punished the innocent more than
the guilty. The blow fell heaviest upon the
women and childi’en. Annie had seen it
time and time again. The men sowed and
the women reaped.
She was conscious of a sharp pain in her
chest as she rose to put the light on in the
kitchen. Chook disliked a darkened house.
Mostly he needed some sort of a beacon
to steer by on these disproportionate home-
comings. The pain in her chest made Annie
gasp- and catch her lip between her teeth.
It had grown steadily worse since she had
wakened with it in the early morning. It
made her dizzy as she groped for the
cracked jug to give the geraniums their
evening drink. The red blooms were a
blur. She set the jug down presently, half-
emptied, and crept to her bed, trying to
fight the nausea in her throat.
Just then Slade was turning to McCaf-
ferty, half a block away, as they finished
their inspection of the long aisles of dark-
ness that bounded Ulster-terrace.
“A mighty decent little woman, Annie
Murty. Think she knows what’s what,
Mac?”
“Not about this, she don’t,” said McCaf-
ferty, spitting. “Chook covered himself
pretty well until this business. We’d have
been none the wiser—though I always had
my eye on him, mind you—only for
Meade’s watchman seeing his face. Chook
Murty was a packer at Meade’s a year
ago.”
“I know,” said Slade. He added incon-
sequentlv: “Well, but she looked sick to
me. I wish the chief had picked somebody
else for this job. To hell with Chook, I
say!”

CORENESS, spots and chafing are all
signs that the skin is losing its invis-
ible oil-bath supplied from glands inside
the tissues. Skin trouble is best remedied
by regular dressings with Zam-Buk,
because this herbal balm contains valu-
able aromatic oils that make good
Nature’s deficiency and quickly restore
the skin to its normal health and flexi-
bility.
Zam-Buk Reaches the Inner Tissues
Zam-Buk is so highly re-
fined as to be readily
absorbed by the pores or
tiny breathing holes shown
by this magnifying glass.
Thus Zam-Buk gets at the
root of obstinate and irritat-
ing disease beyond the reach
of fatty ointments and dress-
ings which only clog the
pores and lie useless on the
skin’s surface.
Zam-Buk Heals from Be-
low and generates real skin
health. It ends pain and
irritation, annihilates germs,
draws off all bad matter, and
grows new skin.
There are many ointments,
but only one Zam-Buk. Be
sure you use this bland pre-
paration daily to conquer
unhealthy tendencies. Use
it for healing cuts, insect
bites, bruises, burns and
scalds, eczema, pimples,
boils, abscesses, ulcers, bad
legs, piles, ringworm and
poisoned wounds.

“Once when you said that you’d mean
Pentridge,” McCafferty mourned. “Them
days is gone forever. We feed ’em on cigar-
ettes and Sunday concerts now. while their
folks mostly starve. I’m wondering if
Chook’s hiding in his own home all this
time? It wouldn’t hurt to look the place
over. This’ll be the third night.”
“No,” said Slade quietly. “No, Mac. For
one thing, I don’t believe he’s there. And,
for another, I won’t have us putting the
wind up that little woman before it’s time.
All West Melbourne knows who we want
—all except Annie. It shows what they
think of her in Ulster-terrace. If these
crooked runts won’t hurt her we’ll save
her as far as we can. Let’s see what the
morning brings.”
News, indeed; but not of Chook. Annie
Murty was dying. Old Mrs. Pringle, her
pendulous cheeks aquiver with the fame of
discovery, made garrulous outcry in the
ears of the policeman just going off night
duty.
“I goes in not five minutes ago, thinkin’
ter borrer er bit er tea fer Mike’s brekfus,
an’ there she was, poor dearie, tumblin’
over ther bed, like she was shickered a
treat. Orl of er fever, poor lamb. And
’er on ’er own.”
“Double pneumonia,” said the hastily
summoned doctor. He drew the attention
of the policeman to the grimy concourse
that struggled to invade the room. “Chase
that rabble away, and send for the district
nurse. No use worrying the poor thing
with hospitals. It’s a matter of hours.
What’s she saying?”
Mrs. Pringle, momentarily evading the
policeman’s ejecting hand, bent her shaking
head to Annie.
“Suthin’ erbout ’er gerainums, poor
dearie. Many er time I’ve ’eard ’er ’nd
Chook wordin’ each other over them
things. Proud ain’t the”
“Get on,” said the policeman sharply.
The doctor was gathering up his gloves
and hat. His eye rested vaguely for a
second upon the straggling red blooms. A
stalk had been crushed by a ruthless elbow
and hung limply over the edge of the box.
Somehow over the staled room a tiny
fragrance was born. The doctor frowned
and turned impatiently.
“Let that old woman stay till the nurse
comes. I’ll give an injection.”
Slade heard of it from McCafferty an
hour later. He broke a short silence by
saying abruptly: “I don’t know but what
Annie might do worse than die. All that
rottenness couldn’t touch her. Mac, we’ll
take Chook Murty this night. He’ll hear,
and he’ll make for home. Yes, that’s right.
I don’t mean because he’s fond of Annie,
but because she’s fond of him. She’ll
draw him. He couldn’t keep away if he
tried and, by God, he’ll try.”
At that moment Annie managed to
Chook’s name clearly, for the first time.
Mrs. Pringle, staring with puckered, hostile
eyes through the window-pane at the nurse
alighting from a taxi, winced at the painful
rasp of Annie’s breath.
“Yer ’usband. dearie, eh? Don’t yer
know where ’e is?”
“No,” Said Annie faintly. She added,
still more faintly, as though defending
Chook against the ugly twist of Mrs.
Pringle’s lips. “He’s got a new place. I
forget where.”
But if Annie did not know, others did.
By devious ways the news came to Chook
over the crooked wires of the underworld.
He was at first blasphemously incredulous;
then frightened. Annie croaking! Strike
him fat, he couldn’t believe it. It was a
trap, a lurk to get him back to Ulster-
terrace. He knew all about Slade and
McCafferty watching the house. This was
some of their play, damn them! Playing
him dirt! Well, he wouldn’t go. He’d
stay in smoke, and to hell with the lot
of them! Annie dying?
Chook spun with a snarl on the rat-face
lounging in the opium-haunted shadow.
• “You’re selling me!”
Rat-face stared and spat. “Yer wouldn’t
fetch enough. Aw, cut the rough, Chook.
It’s the dinkum oil. They had the doc in
’nd all. Mother Pringle’s with ’er now.
Say, Annie’s been askin’ fer yer.”
The sweat started on Chook’s forehead.
He made a gesture of dismissal and
searched sickishly for a cigarette. But the
smoke lay bitter against his parched mouth
and he spat the fag out, with an oath.
God’s truth, Annie dying! He was tremb-
ling with the shock of belief. He found
himself thinking of Annie with a tender-
ness that first surprised, then angered him.
Cripes, she had to pick this time, hadn’t
she? Couldn’t get crook any other time,
could she? Chook paced up and down in
the foetid heat. Strike him fat, the luck
was rotten. The job at Meade’s bungled,
an’ the john-hops fer ’im, and... .and Annie
dying!
Suddenly his mood changed. The fever-
ish groping of his mind was shot with
mawkish, half-forgotten melodies. His
stiff lips trembled on the ever-recurring
name “‘When the Springtime comes,
Gentle Annie-e’... .‘Little Annie Rooney is
my Sweet’art’... .‘Annie-e Laurie’—how
did it go? ‘An f’r bonnie Annie-e Laurie
I would lay me down.’ ”
But he wasn’t going back. Not back to
ULter-terrace; not him. Ulster-terrace—
and the red geraniums. He hated the ——
things. He’d always hated them, ever since
he seen Annie muckin’ round with ’em’....
because Annie loved ’em. That was the
truth of it. Jealous of a bunch of
stalks. As if they was any good to ’er.
Veg’ibles. ’Nd when she got sick, see, they
weren’t no use. She was askin’ fer ’im —
Chook. But he wasn’t going. Let ’er ’ave
’er red geraniums. You’d think ther things
"card all she said, the way she’d used to
talk at ’em. She wanted ’im gaoled....
Rat-face had somehow got back in among
the shadows. His voice came sibilantly to
Chook’s ears.
“What do I say ter Mother Pringle?
When yer cornin’?”
“Ternight,” said Chook hoarsely. His
fingers played at the stubble on his chin.
“Arter dark. Ther back way.”
He wished he hated Annie like—like he
hated the red geraniums. He could have
stayed then. Safe—they’d never find him.
Not where he was. But with Annie asking
for him! Only perhaps she didn’t know
about Meade’s warehouse. A good kid,
Annie. Never magged or put her oar in.
Chook supposed he’d have to tell her a
thing or two if she asked now she
was going. Well, a bloke must live.
Mother Pringle, alone with the dying
Annie, had strangely chosen the moment to
espouse an identical sophistry. The district
nurse had gone, after promising to return
very soon. And now Annie was staring
with glazing eyes at the cracks in the dirty
ceiling. Delirium had passed, leaving so
great inertia that only her brain held con-
sciousness of life. It spelled Chook’s name
with feeble persistence, linking it with that
of her Creator—and his. Mrs. Pringle’s
clumsily proffered truths, in explanation of
Chook’s continued absence, had drawn the
mist of Annie’s dying aside for one second
of superlative entreaty.
“’E ’ad to live, dearie,” Mother Pringle
answered.
The echoes of the mumbled response had
grown in Annie’s brain to an angelically
chanted prayer. Her hands were twitching
at her thin breasts, as though imploring
her man’s safety from man’s law. A smile
came on her lips as she saw a bloom of red
geranium change into a child’s face
Mother Pringle, still muttering, was
opening the door to the gentle knocking
of Slade.
“How’s Annie?”
“Sleepin’, poor lamb,” Mother Pringle
began, in garrulous whispers. “To ’ave
’eard ’er, Mister Slade, torkin’ ter them
geraniums, would break yer ’art. Like as
if, poor dearie, they was alivfe to ’elp ’er,
sayin’ ’ow she loved ’em. Out of ’er
mind like.”
“That’ll do,” said SDde. He looked
wretched. “Now listen to me. McCafferty’s
out in front. I’m going to the back. You
don’t know we’re here—-see. If Chook gets
in here, not a word. You know me.”
Mother Pringle cringed. She began to
whimper.
“Not -in ’ere, Mister Slade. You carn’t
take him in ’ere. Not with Annie”
“Hold your tongue,” said Slade, in a
harassed undertone. “D’yotl want Annie to
hear? Who said anything about taking him
in here? There won’t be a sound more than
I can help. Now, mind what I said.”
Far down the black avenues of night, as
Slade withdrew, a dog howled dismally.
Chook Murty, feeling his way through the
maze of boarded lanes, heard it and snarled,
doglike, under his laboring breath. His
fibres were attuned to instant flight; the
hair lay dank upon his narrow forehead.
The hand that fumbled for the sagging
gate was slimed with beads of fear.
He began to move inwards as a shadow
moves, treading the darkness like a cat.
The blind of Annie’s window was drawn,
but through the torn edge shone a jagged
line of gaslight. It threw into relief a row
of straggled stalks, and Chook knew a sud-
den moil of inward blasphemy. “The
red geraniums!” Only that Annie was ill
he would have torn the box from its ledge
and kicked it to bits. Only that Annie
was ill
He was at the window now holding his
breath. His cheek brushed the hated ger-
aniums as his eye sought the beyond.
Mother Pringle was huddled upon the one
chair. Her face was contorted. Chook’s
gaze, following hers, rested fearfully on the
bed. Something swelled in his throat, and
his heart leaped. He saw the body so
starkly outlined under the drawn sheet and
realisation smote him like a blow.
At that moment the creeping Slade
sprang. A cry—less of afraid surprise than
of unfathomed bereavement escaped
Chook. By a miracle, as it seemed, his
twisting body evaded the outflung hands
of the other. He rolled over into the black-
ness of the yard.
“I’ll shoot,” Slade warned between his
teeth.
He fell back a second, launching himself
for pursuit. As he did so something caught
the sleeve of his coat. He tugged side-
ways, stumbled and fell, a shower of earth
and broken boards about his head. Half-
blinded, he scrambled to his feet, furiously
aware of other feet that filled his ears with
mocking echoes. From round the side of
the house raced McCaffertv, open-mouthed.
“You called?”
“He got away,” Slade panted. He stared
incredulously at the darkness. “The win-
dow-box fell on me.”
He moved into the circle of light stream-
ing past Mother Pringle at the opened door,
and McCaffertv exclaimed sharply: “You’ve
cut your hand.”
Slade looked and laughed shortly: “No,
it’s all right.”
He was looking at Annie with commis-
eration as he brushed from his palm two
or three crushed petals of red geranium.
