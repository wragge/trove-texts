LITERARY NOTES.
Current English Literature.
Our literature of to-day has many charac-
teristics ; but its central note is the dominant
influence of Sociology—enthusiasm for social
truths as an instrument of social reform. It
is scientific, subjective, introspective, his-
jprical, archaeological — full of vitality,
versatility and diligence ; intensely personal,
defiant of all law, of standards, of conven-
tion ; laborious, exact, but often indifferent
to grace, symmetry or color; it is learned,
critical, cultured ; with all its ambition and
its fine feeling, it is unsympathetic to the
highest forms of the imagination, and quite
alien to the drama of action. . . .
• • • •
This predominance of Sociology, the rest-
less rapidity of modem life, the omnipre-
sence of material activity, fully account for
the special character of modern literature.
Literature is no longer “bookish” —but
practical, social, propagandist. It is full of
fife—but it is a dispersive, analytic, erratic
form of vitality. It has a most fastidious
taste in form—but it often flings the critical
spirit aside in its passion for doing, in its
ardour to convince and to inspire. It is in-
dustrious, full of learning and research—but
it regards its learning as an instrument of in-
fluence, not as an end of thought. It can
work up a poem or an essay as carefully as
Mieris or Breughel polished a cabinet pic-
ture —and it can “ tear a passion to tatters,”
or tumble its note-books into a volume all in
a heap. It has no “standard,” no “model,”
no “ best writer”—and yet it has a curious
faculty for reviving every known form, and
imitating any style. It is intensely histori-
cal, but so accurately historical that it is
afraid to throw the least color of imagination
around its history. Ifrhas consummate poetic
feeling, and copious poetic gifts —but it has
now no single poet of the first rank. It has
infinite romantic resources, and an army of
skilful novelists—and yet it has no single
living writer worthy to be named beside
she great romancers of the nineteenth cen-
tury.
* * * *
What is the cause % I do not hesitate to
say it is that we have over-trained our taste,
We are overdone with criticism, we are too
systematically drilled, there is far too much
moderate literature, and far too fastidious a
standard in literature. Every one is afraid
to let himself go, to offend the conventions,
dr to raise a sneer. It is the inevitable re-
sult of uniformity in education and discipline
in mental training. Millions can write good
grammar, easy and accurate sentences, and
imitate the best examples of the age. Educa-
tion has been driven at high pressure into
literary lines, and a monotonous correctness
in literary taste has been erected into a
moral code. Tens of thousands of us can
put the finger on a bit of exaggeration, or a
false light in the local colour, or a slip in
perfect realism. The result is a photographic
accuracy of detail, a bai’ren monotony of
commonplace, and the cramping of real in-
ventive genius. It is the penalty of giving
ourselves up to mechanical culture. . . .
* * * *
In all the ages of great productive work
there were intense individuality, great free-
dom, and plenty of failures. Tom Jones
delighted the town which was satiated with
gross absurdities, some of them, alas ! from
the pen of Fielding himself. Shakespeare
wrote happily before criticism had invented
the canons of the drama, and Sir Walter’s
stories had no reviews to expose his historical
blunders. In the great romance age which
began to decline some forty years ago, there
was not a tithe of such good average work as
we get now ; criticism had not become a fine
art; every one was free to like what he
pleased, and preposterous stuff was written
and enjoyed. Ox course it cannot be good
to like preposterous stuff, and an educated
taste ought to improve literature. But it is
almost a worse thing when general culture
produces an artificial monotony, when people
are taught what they ought to like, when to
violate the canons of taste is far worse than
to laugh at the Ten Commandments.
• * • *
With a very high average of fairly good
work, an immense mass of such work, and
an elaborate code of criticism, the produc-
tion of brilliant and inimitable successes
is usually arrested in every field. Having
thousands of graceful verse-writers, we have
no great poet; in a torrent of skilful fiction,
we have no great novelist; with many charm-
ing painters, who hardly seem to have a
fault, we have no great artist; with mises-en-
scene, make-up costumes, and accessories for
our plays such as the world never saw before,
we have no great actor ; and with ten thou-
sand thoughtful writers, we have not a single
genius of the first rank. Elaborate culture
easts chill looks on original ideas. Genius
itself is made to feel the crudeness and ex-
travagance of its first efforts and retires with
shame to take a lower plaee. We are all so
fastidious about form and have got such fixed
regulation views about form, we are so cor-
rect, so much like one another, such good
boys and girls, that the eccentricities and
idiosyncrasies of the inventive spirit are
taught from childhood to control themselves
and to conform to the decorum of good
society. A highly-organised code of culture
may give us good manners, but it is the
death of genius.— Frederic Harrison, in
“ Studies in Early Victorian Literature.’’
In Brief.
“ Isban Israel ” is the title of a novel by
G. H. Cossins, of S.A. Surveyor-General’s
office, to be published shortly in London by
Gay and Bird.
Victor Daley is busy revising his poems
for publication, and the book will be issued
by Angus and Robertson shortly. A per-
manent place in Australasian literature
awaits it. It was Daley who caught the lyre
that fell from Kendall’s relaxing fingers,
and he has sung for us in a manner worthy
of his master. Since Brunton Stephens
ceased to write, there has been no Austra-
lian to match the color, and brilliance, and
tender sentiment, and delicate imagery of
Daley’s verse.
Frederic Harrison’s ‘ ‘ Studies in Early
Victorian Literature ” contain some of the
sanest, most judicious criticism printed for a
long time. There is a trace of the old fogy
in Mr. Harrison, but it does not hinder him
from being perhaps the very best contem-
porary guide to appreciations of English
literature. Churton Collins is more learned
and more thorough, hardly so suggestive,
doubtfully so sound ; Saintsbury, beside
Harrison, is a mere beguiling gossip.
K.S. : “Ido not see, a propos of Edward
Maitland’s ‘Life of Anna Kingsford,’ any
allusion to his stay in Australia. Yet is he
not tho man who came to N.S. Wales years
ago, formed a platonic friendship with the
late Mrs. , and was reputed to have
‘ immortalised ’ her in one of his books—was
it ‘The Pilgrim and the Shrine’ 9 I remember
a dear old Sydney lady telling me, with many
shakes of the head, that he was a dreadful
man who ‘ believed in free-love ! ’ Poor old
lady ! She is at rest, and so spared the
modern woman and Hill-top novel.”
The death of Lady Wilde (“ Speranza,” of
The Nation) suggests mournful thoughts of
all the other impassioned bards who wrote
their hearts into the Young Ireland uprising
—wild hearts, scattered into dust of many
lands. Old Dr. O’Doherty, in Brisbane (he
married “Eva,” another well-known writer
for The Nation), and C. G. Duffy, in Nice,
are the only remnants of “the men of ’48.”
George Robertson and Co. issue a booklet
of illustrated • examples of English vowel
sounds, by Clarence Woodhouse, which may
fill an educational niche. The compiler
slips occasionally—-as in his identification of
the sound of u in true with the sound of u in
cube.
Leslie M. Oakes writes the first story in
Geo. Robertson’s “ Cooee ” series. (Recent
Australian “series,” by the way, seem to
consist of one volume only.) ‘ ‘ Ben Tillett’s
Fortune ” is a short tale of local mining life
which exhibits a good deal of crude vigor
and some inventive capacity.
“In modern literary language, man scarcely
exists save in his extremities. For wc take
the pubes as a centre, and we thence describe
a circle with a radius of some 18 inches—in
America the radius is rather longer—and we
forbid any reference to any organ within
that circle, save that maid-of-all-work the
stomach ; in other words, we make it im-
possible to say anything to the point con-
cerning the central functions of life.”—
Havelock Ellis.
“ Women, Love, and Life,” by William
Platt (Lond : Chas. Hirsch), is an unusual
book. One opinion of it is that it is “a rich
book—verse with the spring of the lion,
prose with sinews of steel.” That is the
author’s own opinion, printed at the end of
his essay, and so giving an excellent a priori
reason for disagreement. Numerous reasons
come a posteriori. William Platt seems to
have a soft spot in his cerebellum, and his
performance—a collection of thoughts on
sex-relationships—is mainly a tissue of erotic
incoherencies considerably more hysterical
than Whitman’s “ Children of Adam.” The
author’s intentions are apparently good ; his
inventions have occasional suggestive value ;
and his conventions —well, he hasn’t any.
And the gist of him is nothing like so new
or so true as he seems to think.
The New Review, distancing competitors,
prints a short story by Stephen Crane, whose
“Red Badge of Courage ” has won him a
rare literary vogue. It is a psychological
study of the effects of fear, with the re-
semblance of style and matter to Ambrose
Bierce’s more marked than ever. But
Bierce’s work—in “The Man and the Snake,”
for example—is more impressive, more con-
vincing. Again it is to be complained that
Crane’s brilliant epithets and similes do not
really give a vivid mental picture. They
seem always detached from the subject,
whose outlines are obscured in the dazzle,
and shimmer, and glare. You can’t see the
moon for the halo..
“The Red Badge,” by the way, isn’t
Crane’s first book, though it is the first to
make him known. He has published a col-
lection of verse, “The Black Riders,” and
The Bookman says he has a warm admirer
in Kipling.
According to Robert Sherard, the French
are as proud of Paul Verlaine as the English
of Tennyson, yet the most he ever received
in France for a poem was five francs.
Zola’s “ Rome ” will reach Austialia about
the beginning of July.
H.C.B. : Thanks ; but Heine (and especi-
ally “Es war ein alter Konig”) has been
done so often that you couldn’t detect spuri-
ous translation-coin. Can you lay hands on
a good, short, recent piece suitable ?
Frederic Harrison : “ The world is grow-
ing less interesting, less mysterious, less mani-
fold, at any rateto the outer eye. . . . Magnifi-
cence, squalor, oddity, historic and
picturesque personalities grow rarer year by
year. Everybody writes a grammatical letter
in conventional style, wears the clothes in
fashion, and conforms to the courtesies of
life. It is right, good, and wise : but a
little dull. . . . We live longer, but
in quiet, comfortable, oru. r'v ways. This
is not at all injurious to morality, politics,
industry, science, philosophy, or religion. It
is not necessarily injurious to poetry, at least
of the lower flight. But it is adverse to high
art. And it is asphyxiating to romance.’

Now Christ thee save, Paul Kruger 1
Now Christ thee save from harm ;
And may the God of Joshua
Bear up thy strong right arm.
May He who fought the battles
Of all thv hero sires,
When Orange William kindled
The blaze of Freedom’s fires ;
May He whose stern war-angel
The English pirate smote,
When Cromwell’s bloody talons
Were crooked at Holland’s throat;
May He who cast his aegis
O’er flooded dyke and dam,
When down ’mid roaring billows,
Went France’s oriflamme;
May He defend the children
Who kept the fathers’ cause,
Who raised the ocean ramparts,
And bade the spoiler pause.
No guardian surges round them
Laugh now the foe to scorn,
But swelling thews and sinews
Of men to freedom sworn ;
And breasts with Right thrice-plated
And hands that love the sword,
And hearts that count most holy
The drops for freedom poured ;
And brains that guide in wisdom
The arms that strain to smite;
And Mind, o’er all victorious,
That leads the van in fight;
And o’er them, and about them,
The rapture of a world
That hails the snapping fetters,
The tyrant downward hurled ;
Yea, o’er them, and about them,
The prayer of every slave.
The hopes of every champion, **
The blessings of the brave.
Lo ! these shall be the bu’warks
No redcoat robber scales,
Till once again his banner
Before the Dutchman’s trails !
Then bring the new-born infant,
The balie iu glory sent,
From War’s red font baptismal
His shining brow besprent;
And hold him well, Paul Kruger 1
And shield him with thy life,
And for his sake he hallowed
That bloody sweat and strife 1
And joy shall lash the pulses
O freeman and of slave,
To see the Young R public
Throned on a despot’s grave.
Then Christ thee keep, Paul Kruger 1
Then Christ thee keep from harm;
And may thy deathless story
Nerve many a patriot’s arm.
Ah ! Christ thee keep, Paul Kruger!
And shrine thee in the skies ;
No fairer spirit walketh (
The fields of Paradise;
No brighter Star hath heaven
’Mid all the flaming band,
Than he who lives and labors
And dies—for Fatherland.

Oh, the sweet dried lavender !
Oh, the more than scent in it 1
The butterflies and bees astir,
The pipe of linnets pent in it 1
Brick and smoke and mire have fled—
Time and space between drop dead—
Oh, the sweet dried lavender !
I can hear the pigeons whirr,
I can count the quarters chiming,
I can watch the ivy climbing
Clinging close from eave to basement,
Clasping, shadowing all the casement.
Within, against the raftered wall,
The oaken press stands black and tall,
I see its folded linen store
Gleam athwart its open door—
I smell the lavender, fresh-dried,
Strewing all the shelves inside.
Unmade is yet your shroud, mother—
Not yet you are in heaven —
You count the sheets aloud, mother,
And smooth and lay them even.
Your jingling keys, with music low,
Measure your steppings to and fro ;
And sorting, piling, still you croon
Some soft, half-uttered cradle tune.
Oh, the sweet dried lavender !
1 hear the wise old tabby purr,
Curled on the window-sill asleep,
When winter sunlights slant and creep.
I hear, without, familiar babel
Of turkeys at the barn-door,
I, perched upon the kitchen table
In socks and pinafore.
My head is all a golden mop;
Upon my cheek the round tears drop;
The frosty morning weather nips
My nose and toes and finger tips.
Mother, so quick you leave your sheets !
The shelf of sugars and of sweets
So well you rifle for my 'meal,
Almond and fig and candied peel!
You clap my little palms, mother —
You kiss away their cold—
You take me in your arms, mother—
And I am five years old.
MAY PROUIN.
A Contributors’ Commentary.
Maeterlinck and Rossetti.
Writes M.L.M. : I think that Maeterlinck, the
once-vaunted “ Dutch Shakespeare,’’ who is little
or nothing if not imitative, has filched the germ-
inspiration of his “ Et s’tl revenait” from Ros-
setti, and indirectly therefore from Hamlet. (In
“Princess Maleine” he shows further acquaint-
ance with Hamlet.) Ophelia’s snatch of ballad
song, “How shall I my true love know?” was
developed by the poet-painter in the following
verses, under the title
An Old Song Endf,d.
" How shall l your true love know
t rorn another one?”
" By his cockle-hat and staff,
And his sandal shoon.”
•• And what signs have told you DOW
That he hastens home?”
•* Lo ! the spring is nearly gone.
He is nearly come.”
“ For a token is there nought
Say, that he should bring ? ”
“ He will bear a ring I gave,
And another ring.”
“ How may I, when he shill ask,
Tell him who lies there?”
" Nay, but leave m,v face unveiled,
And unbound my hair.”
Uan you say to me some word
1 shall say to him ?
Say I'm looking in his eyes,
Though my eyes are dim.
* * * •
The key-note of the ballad as revived bv Ros-
setti is an intense, almost bold, simplicity of
rhythm, rhyme, and expression. This simplicity,
the outcome of labor, knowledge, consummate art,
deceives t..e ordinary poetry-reader into the belief
that he himself might have written so. II would
yield reverent admiration for the workman-hip of
Lancelot and Elaine, and smile toleratingly at
such a poem as Rossetti’s marvellously dramatic
ballad, “Sister Helen,” seeing nothing but child’s
play in
“ Why did you meet yon waxen man,
Sister Helen?
To-day is the third t-ince you hegan.”
“ The time was short, yet the time ran,
Little Brother.”
“But if you have done your work aright,
Sister Helen,
You will let me play, for you said I might.”
“ Be very stili in your play to-night,
Little Brother.”
• * * •
Another word about translation. A ballad is
perhaps the most difficult form of poetry to trans-
late into verse. The difficulty lies in the absence
of epithet, in the bare, unavoidable substantives
that have often no synonyms, yet refuse to accom-
modate their syllables to the metre chosen. In
“Et s’il revenait” there is no adjective until the
fourth verse. In the adjective lies the transla-
tor’s sal vation. He can always find synonyms of
different syllables, and adjust his metre thereby.
The Bush Story.
Writes R. A.F. : Re J.H.G. and the bush story.
Do not absence of acoessory scem-ry and frill
make this more true and more dramatic? The
bushman does not travel in tourist’s knickors
looking for the picturesque. When making his
way up a coastal gully he sniffs the scented gum,
and sees on the ridges the white shaft tower high
above its black neighbor, the ironbark, and under
both the grass-tree’s pendent green blades. The
beauty of the fern, shaded by granite boulders
over which threads of water shoot, appeals to him
as to others ; but it is not his reason for being
there. Tropical rams have left water for prospect-
ing ; and, naturally enough, he talks and writes
only of the tunnel and shaft. The Western man
watches thecluuds fly over siiver-gray downs driven
by ever restless winds, and miles away sees the
line of timber that marks a creek ; but he is on a
muster, and incidents on the clay-pan where
cutting-out is going on are the things that engross
him. The bushman is in direct and naked con-
flict with nature, and the revenges she takes upon
him by flood or drought, caving drive or falling
tree, are his subject. Art or no art, here is the
dominating point of view for him. W~hen the
bushman beoomes “introspective,” he lands in
the lunatic asylum of this particular province
(Queensland). He is no nearer a problem-play or
■ex-novel than were the early Welsh bards. His
compass is short, but if he reaches beyond it he
strikes a false note. Still, perhaps, a savage in
literature, would he look any better in a trade
shirt ?


Medical.
COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
UUKiIiD BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat,and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to .become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. VV. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. 1 write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a mo9t
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I be ante,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sidney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
m'uils. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cut e, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tainworth, N.S.W.’’
‘ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’B Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.’’- Signed

XT MAY BE SELDOM
That Medical Advertisements can be relied on, but we here assert the following facts, which can be
borne out from Testimonials in our possession. Thousands may see this, and treat it as some
announcements deserve, but in this they would make a great mistake,
AND FOR THIS REASON :
by taking notice of what we have already done and can do, as proved by thousands of grateful
acknowledgments of our skill which we hold, it may Save Your Life and that of your dear ones.

Dr. Gibbons
Having completed his New and Centrally-situated
Electrical Consulting Itooms
Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends
and Patients at
137 Elizabeth-street, SYDNEY.
Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILITY,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “ Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, yon experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances,
prescribes Mercury in any form.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
immediately they have been read and answered,
and that their cases and names will remain a
secret between the Doctor and themselves.
Dr. GIBBONS has documentary evidence of
having thoroughly CURED Thousands of Cases
during the extended time he has practised as a
Specialist in Australia.

The Wheels of the System.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Where is God, whilst all around us sounds the
jarring of the wheels,
W hen the cry of human anguish starwards thro’
his glory steals ?
there is neither hope nor pity underneath the
moving wheels.
Woe to him who slips and falters whilst the wheels
are moving on !
Woe to him who stays to breathe him when the
goal is nearly won !
There they lie—and lie for ever—over whom the
wheels have gone 1
O, my brothers, draw we nearer to the dream the
poet sings ?
War, red war, and rapine ruletli underneath the
shows of things.
Underneath the Masque of Mercy there are whips
of many stings.
Here in silence, reft of slumber, with sad heart I
dream and doubt,
Star by star the night is waning, star by star the
night goes out;
But the endless strife of all things ceases not within,
without.
Beat by beat the cold light groweth, beat by beat
the morn comes in
With his crimson robes about him like a royal
Paladin ;
But the endless strife of all things ceases not with-
out, within.
O er the peaceful face of Nature smiles serene the
gracious sun,
And men smile and hide their tactics when the
battle has begun.
dear the clumsy masks asunder and behold what
things are done !
For the wheels go on for ever, crushing thro’ the
human hives,
And the goal the victor reaches rests upon a million
lives,
And the motive shall not profit: it is only Power
survives !
Where weak women starve and sicken, dying in
the paths they trod,
Where strong men are bent and broken underneath
the System’s rod,
Will you smile and prate and tell me, “ This is
still the will of God ” ?
But I hear like distant thunder welling deep from
out the sky,
Tortured with the grief of ages, an exceeding
bitter cry:
‘ ‘ There is none can stay them ever, were he
mightier than I.”
“ Deeper laws than Love are hidden in the power
that runs through this.
All the fiery wheels of Heaven through the seas of
ether hiss,
Star and sun and planet rolling onward through
the black abyss.
“Wail no more, O fellow workers, for the aid He
fails to lend.”
Stricken with a deathless sorrow for the ills He
cannot mend,
God, the Worker, fights in silence for the good He
cannot send.
“Not the Lord of Love, creator of all grief, and
pain, and crime,
But a god-like soul ennobled, battling for a goal
sublime,
Thro’ the bloodshed of the asons forward to the
happier time.
“ Thine the world to mould and make it free for
all from rim to rim,
Thine to fight and toil and triumph over every
problem grim,
To create and cure and conquer, working onwards,
on with Him.
“ Face to face with iron systems, face to face with
endless odds,
Where the wheels of Heaven forever race beneath
His chariot-rods,
Soul of Man, whate'er thy sorrow, is thy burden
more than God’s ? ”

SATURDAY, APRIL 4,189 G.
Chamberlain on Federation.
Mr. Chamberlain said that it was essential that they
should seek for Imperial Federation on the line offerin'*-
the least resistance, and which would, at the same time”
establish common interests and obligations in the direc-
tion of defence and trade. This having- been accom-
plished, they could then create a representative authority.
It was imperative, however, that they should approach
the commercial side of the question. The colonies had
taken the initiative in this particular at the Imperial Con-
ference held at Ottawa.
The systems of commercial union hitherto suggested
had, Mr. Chamberlain said, offered Great Britain inade-
quate advantages for the loss and risks involved. The
dispatch of the Marquis of Ripon, the late .Secretary of
State for the Colonies, declaring that Imperial Federation
was impossible, did not debar the favorable consideration
of the question. Mr, Chamberlain thought, however,
that a better proposal would he the establishment of a
system of Freetrade throughout the Empire with revenue
duties only, This would probably lead to a satisfactory
scheme of Federation. The advantages of Freetrade
throughout the Empire were so enormous that the
colonies would be bound to carefully weigh and consider
the whole question. If the principle were once accepted,
It would then be reasonable for the Imperial Government
to convene a Council of the Empire to formulate a
definite scheme. —Cablegram,
The above represents the idea of Imperial
Federation as it presents itself to the shop-
keeping soul of J. Bull. It is propounded
by Chamberlain, the Birmingham screw-
maker, the essentially commercial man of
the Government. The British
commercial man of to-day lives in a perpetual
search for “new markets.” His own market,
under the Foreign-trade regime, is overrun
by the manufacturers and agriculturists, of
Continental Europe and America ; and, while
German and Belgian goods are swamping his
own cities, the British maker is hunting for
customers on the upper waters of the Nile
and the Congo, and around the Nyanzas and
the Mountains of the Moon. He can’t keep
hold of the customer in the next street, but
his energy in looking for the customer in
China or Borneo is unlimited. Chamber-
lain’s idea of commercial Federation is an-
pther phase of this constant search for new
markets. For many years past the depend-
encies of the Empire have been largely in-
creasing their imports, but the increase has
been principally in French, German, Bel-
gian, American, and other products, and the
demand for British goods has been practically
stationary. Chamberlain’s remedy for this
state of things, if the cablegram expresses
his views correctly, is beautifully simple and
effective. It is practically an agreement that
the “colonies ” are to buyfrom Bull, whether
it pays them to do so or not. In all points
of difference which hinder this beautiful con-
summation, the “ colonies ” are to give way ;
they are to surrender everything, while J.
Bull surrenders nothing ; and everything is
to be fixed just as J. Bull would like it to be.
* * * *
At present Great Britain travels on Foreign-
trade, or rather revenue tariff, principles
because she believes that these principles are
best for her interests, and for no other reason.
The self-governing provinces mostly travel
on protective principles tor exactly the same
reason. Before any commercial union of the
Empire can be arrived at there must be a
common fiscal system, and Chamberlain
suggests, as a simple and handy method of
arriving at this agreement, that the
“colonies” should adopt J. Bull’s system in
its entirety. Britain built her manufactures
and her commerce by many years of Protec-
tion, but for the sake of symmetry Australia
uid Canada are not to do likewise because
Britain has herself finished doing like-
wise. Also, Britain, as a country which
has a vast income from money lent abroad-,
is very differently situated from Aus-
ralia, which is drained by paying interest
>n money borrowed abroad. Britain is
protected from the aggressively cheap -
1 ibor nations the Hindoos, Chinamen,
md Japanese—by many thousands of miles
of sea-carriage, while Australia has them
practically at her door ; but these circum-
stances are by no means taken into account.
Britain did not expose her manufacturing
industries to the competition of all the
vorld until a long period of Protection
had helped to put her far ahead of all
:ompetitors. And, further, Britain, as
he principal carrier of the world’s com-
nerce, makes a large indirect profit out
f the Foreign-trade system which partly
aakes up for- the direct loss, for almost all
he cheap labor products which are humped
rom the uttermost ends of the globe to com-
»ete with her own workers pay toll to her on
he way in the shape of sea-freights, while if
Australia adopted Britain’s fiscal policy her
inports would pay freights not to herself,
>ut to Britain. Therefore, even if Freetrade
s good for Britain, which is doubtful, it no
nore follows that it is good for Australia,
vhich has not one circumstance in common
vith the alleged mother-country, than the
act that Britain requires a big navy proves
hat Switzerland, which has no sea-coast,
vants one also.
* * ♦ *
If the brief cablegram correctly repre-
sents Chamberlain’s scheme for the com-
mercial union of the empire, that scheme
practically, as regards Australia, boils
down as follows. Australia is to open
its ports to British, German, Chinese,
oid all other manufactured products,
and thereby wipe out its infant indus-
ries, furnish J. Bull with a magnifi-
cent market, and give him also the profits to
>e derived from the work of carrying this
great influx of goods across the ocean. In
return, J. Bull will continue to take Aus-
tralian wool, wine, &c., so long as he can’t
get them cheaper elsewhere, which he must
do in any case because his cold and narrow
isle doesn’t produce these things in anything
like sufficient quantity. Australia, for the
sake of falling in line with Britain, is to be
swamped by cheap Chinese and Japanese
goods (filtered through Hong Kong and
Singapore), from which Britain is largely
protected by its immense sea-distances,
and Britain is to be paid for carrying
these goods. Britain and the protected
provinces of Australia all follow their
own interests in their fiscal policy; for the
sake of uniformity these protected provinces
are to surrender what they believe to be their
interests on Britain’s unsupported assurance
that it will be well for them to do so. The
idea of Britain reversing her policy for the
sake of uniformity on, say, Victoria’s assur-
ance that it will be well for her to do so
doesn’t even enter into the calculation. It
is Britain, not Australia, which desires the
Customs Union ; nevertheless, Australia is
to make great sacrifices to gain what it doesn’t
want, while Britain gets what it does want
gratis. Altogether, there is a whole-souled
one-sidedness about Chamberlain’s ideas of
uniformity which is eminently British, and
his idea of reciprocity seems to be that
Australia should reciprocate while Britain
doesn’t.
* * * *
There is one way, and only one, by which
an Imperial Customs Union is possible—
whether it would be probable even in this way
is another question. If Britain is prepared to
accept a scheme by which there will be Free-
trade inside the Empire and high customs-
barriers against everybody outside, then there
would at least be a semblance of decency
about her proposals. In that case the wool
and wheat and wine and dairy produce and
frozen meat of this country would have a
long start in the British markets over the
produce of Argentina, the U.S., Russia,
Denmark, and all other dangerous competi-
tors. And, in return for this, Australia
might agree to let the British manufacturer
have the free run of the Australian markets,
seeing that his admission thereto would not
also mean the admission of the Chinaman,
Japanese, German, and all the cheap-labor
classes of the world. The Englishman works,
as a rule, moderate hours for a more or less
reasonable wage, and the Australian might,
in course of time, hold his own against him •
the Chinaman, who is prepared to work with
hands and feet and teeth for sixteen hours
per diem if necessary, is a totally different
circumstance. The contract would have to
apply to goods only ; the dark-skinned
races of the Empire might, possibly, be
permitted free access for their produce
to every part of the imperial territories
if there was any sufficient inducement
offered in return, but free access tor
themselves would be no part of the bargain.
And the bargain itself must be termma lie
on due notice by either party. Ihen tie
contract, so far as concerned Britain and
Australia, would simply be that each party
had the first claim on the markets of the
other as against all competitors from out-
side the Empire, and if the results weie
satisfactory the agreement might continue
indefinitely—or it might not, just as things
eventuated.
Such an agreement would be based on
purely business lines ; there would be no
provision for any aggressive loyalty about it,
or for any grandiloquent whooping concern-
ing “theF’iag.” Australia would be inter-
ested in the defence of Britain merely because
Britain was the most reliable purchaser of her
wool and butter, and because anything which
brought great disaster to Britain might
• destroy the league and thereby deprive this
country of its preferential rights in the wool
and butter trade. If these preferential
rights had proved of such value as to be
worth defending, then Australia might take
an active interest in the defence of Britain.
Britain would have equally good reason for
taking an interest in the defence of Aus-
tralia, as a country which gave it prac-
tically the exclusive right to supply it with
such manufactured goods as it didn’t make
for itself. Britain would lose nothing by the
bargain ; its exports to most foreign coun-
tries are already blocked by the highest tariff
barriers which these countries see lit, in their
own interests, to erect, and its condition
could hardly be made any worse in this
respect; and in any case, anything it might
lose in the matter of foreign trade would
probably be made good by the extra trade
done with the over-sea provinces of the
Empire. Also it would gain the inestimable
advantage of depending for its food supplies
on its own relatives, whereas it is now
mostly dependent on more or less reliable
enemies. The provinces would probably
gain as much as they lost or a little more—
at all events the balance would be about as
even as anything in this world is likely to be.
* * * *
So far, however, there appears to be no
definite reason why Australia should want
to take any chances by fooling around with
any Imperial Customs union, however per-
fect it may seem before it is tried. But if
anything of the kind ever does eventuate it
must be something wholly different from
Chamberlain’s proposals, or those of any
other British politician up to date. If
the gains and losses can’t be evenly
balanced and any sacrifice has to be made
for the sake of union it is Britain that
must make it; it is Britain, not Aus-
tralia, that desires a Customs union, and
in trading matters it is the person who wants
a thing that has to pay for it—not the one
who doesn t want it. * There is no earthly
use in appealing to Australia to federate
commercially on suicidal terms for the glory
of the empire—it is Britain’s empire, not
ours. Also, it is no use putting anything in
the negotiation about the noble traditions of
“ the Flag ” ; Australia doesn’t own the flag
and can t be expected to take anything more
than a passing interest in it. The Chamber-
lain variety of Customs Union, in fact—
always providing that the cable-liar has
correctly represented it —is too wildly
grotesque to be seriously considered by
any sane being. It is practically that
Australia should give' up its fiscal policy, a
large part of its revenues and almost all its
manufactures—that it should throw open its
ports to all the cheap products of Asia and
Europe, for even if it shut out the goods of
Germany, China and Japan, freetrade within
the empire would mean that these goods
could come in via Britain, or Hongkong,
or Singapore and that, in return, it
should get just what it has already, and what
it would have in any case. The average
British politician has so vast an idea of the
interests of England as to be incapable of
realising that any other interests can exist
anywhere to any serious extent, and Cham-
berlajn seems to have got this disease as
bactiy as his contemporaries.

authority in their own favor as not—if they
were honest they would never get credit for it
owing to the false position in which they also
are placed. If all the insurance co’s would
refuse to insure old, unseaworthy craft and
their cargoes, then no one would ship goods by
them, and they would become practically out-
lawed, and most of the companies would, in all
probability, be glad to do this ; only each one is
certain that, even if it kept faith, some “scab”
office would break the agreement at the last
moment, and insure all the coffin-ships in a
lump, and get all the good business in consider-
ation of doing so, and thereby leave its com-
petitors in the lurch. If there existed any
authority which would compel all the ship-
owners to keep their vessels up to a first-class
standard, probably even the shipowners would
not object very much when they got used to
the situation. The extra expense would fall on
them pretty equally all round, and the fares
and freights would be adjusted to cover it.
But while no such authority exists the co.
which saves money by not repairing its vessels
can thereby run a little cheaper than the one
which doesn’t save money, so wherever there is
competition there is inducement to economise
by letting ships take their chance provided the
rot and the- rust-holes and the leakages and the
general old age are not visible to passengers.
Starting with the assumption that the ship-
owner and the surveyor and the insurance co.
and the various boards don’t care anything in
particular for the lives of the sailor men, the
rest follows as the natural result of Free Com-
petition. And the results are so inextricably
mixed'up that it is practically impossible to say
where the trouble commenced. It may have
started with the frantic competition of the
marine insurance companies, whose desire to cut
each other’s throats led them to cover any kind
of vessel that would float; or with the owners
who starved the repairs account in good times
to pay bigger dividends than each other, and
did the same on a larger and larger scale in bad
times, so that they could offer lower fares and
freights than each other ; or, it may have begun
partly with the shipbuilders who cut each
other’s quotations to get business, and then
supplied vessels that were weak and jerry-
built at the outset because the prices wouldn’t
run to anything better; or more likely it was the
work of all these and other influences combined.
Anyhow, the reasons for the existence of coffin-
ships seem now to be so inextricably mixed up
that unless the State interferes by handing
over the surveying and licensing of all vessels
to some absolutely independent authority, re-
form seems very improbable. The great doc-
trine of Free Competition is like a python with
its tail in its mouth. It has no visible beginning
or end, and no one can attack one part of it
without infuriating all the rest of the animal,
and to expect Free Competition to produce any
remedy for its own ill-doings is just the same
as expecting the python to swallow itself bodily
and thus remove itself out of the way.
The Deceased Wife’s Sister.
What does Hogan, self-elected member for
Australia in the Commons, mean by his De-
ceased Wife’s Sister’s Children Legitimation
Bill? Premiers Reid and Turner have cabled
authority to support it (by the way, by what
right ?), but, for all the information they have
yet received concerning it, it may contain a
repeal of the constitution, a pension to Parkes,
or a toleration of polyandry'. We are told that
it is to legitimatise in England the offspring of
such alliances, when they are valid in the
colony to which the parties belong. But such
marriages of people domiciled in the colonies
are already valid in England, and their children
are already legitimate in England. The only
possible defect is that they may not be
able to succeed to intestate real property
in England. As to such marriages between
people not domiciled in the colonies, the
bishops of the House of Lords will never
allow it, for it would simply mean pass-
ing a Deceased Wife’s Sister’s Act with a con-
dition attached that the parties must undertake
a short sea-trip to get the ceremony performed.
Even if the Bill refers to the succession to
intestate real estate, it is a hasty and ill-con-
sidered, attempt to curry favor, or to justify
Hogan s colonial pose. For in several of the
colonies and in Scotland legitimation by subse-
quent marriage prevails, and, although the
children are legitimate in England, they are
certainly in this case prevented by an absurd
and technical rule of English law from inherit-
ing land. That rule is thus expressed : “ The
English heirship required not only that the
man should be legitimate, but, as it were
porphyro genitus, born within the narrowest
pale of English legitimacy.” If Hogan and co.
were really anxious to mend what is possibly a
wrong, and had properly studied before rushing
into a Bill, they would have framed a measure
to enable certain colonial legitimate children
to succeed to English land in intestacy.” But
if the Bill so hastily assented to by Reid and
lur,ner is really what its title expresses it to
be, it will probably cast serious doubt on the
validity of the marriages where there is none
at present, and may cause by implication
serious confusion as to the status of children
)orn before the Act comes into operation.
Again, what does Hogan mean ?
The Democratic “Argus.”
Melbourne Argus is in a pathetic quandary
over the Vic. Companies Act. It has system-
atically called for vengeance on the “crook”
ankers and company “ haves ” of Smellbourne,
mainly because it suspected the Age of trying
to smother investigation in the early stages of
ie jurst on behalf of its friend Munro and
o - iers. At the same time it urged the Vic.
Oounci l to throw out the Companies Bill (which
me at the root of the evil by making


directors personally responsible for the lying
balance-sheets and unreliable reports issued by
the concerns which they profess to manage, and
prohibited them selling their own properties to
tiieir own companies, and doing many other
shady things), mainly because it was introduced
by the Turner Government which the Age
supports. Now the City of Melbourne Bank
infamy having shown the dire necessity for the
measure which the Argus recently urged
the Council to reject, that paper again demands
the lost Bill in a truculent tone of voice, and
denounces the Turner Government for not sup-
plyinf?*L 1 he present attitude of the Argus is
peculiar. It alleges: (1) That the Companies Bill
is a much-wanted reform and should have been
passed; (2) I hat the Turner Government,
which passed this Bill through the Assembly
and did its best to get it through the Council,
is wholly wrong ; (3) That the Council, which
destroyed this valuable reform, isn’t opposed to
reform at all, and any such assertion is a base
invention by the Government ; (4) That it is
really the Council and not the Government
winch longs for the Bill ; the Council wanted
to pass the Bill (which was a right thing for it
to do), and only threw it out (which was also a
right thing to do) because it arrived at “ the
fag-end of the session ” and because the Upper
House would not be “ bluffed and bullied into
passing serious measures without due considera-
tion. Of course it is obvious that some
measure must be dealt with at the tag-end of
the session if the session is to have any end at
all ; and the Council is supposed to be as intel-
ligent at the end of the session as at any other
time ; and there was abundance of time
for consideration, seeing that the Council
knew what was in the Bill for weeks
before it formally arrived ; and though the
term “fag end” sounds very expressive, it
really means no more than the fag-beginning or
the fag-middle. Also, the Council didn’t de-
stroy the Companies Bill because it arrived at
the end of the session ; it considered it leis-
urely and at great length, and rejected all its
salient clauses because, as James Service
frankly stated, they would “ make a director
responsible for everything he put his name to,”
just like every other man, and the thirty direc-
tors in the House of Landlords flatly refused to
be responsible for the truth of their own state-
ments. The Argus, in its desire to prove that
the Bill was right, and the people who destroyed
it were right, and the people who supported it
were wrong, and that it was really the people
w'ho supported it that didn’t want it, and the
people who destroyed it that longed for it with
a great, unselfish longing, gets itself into a
lamentably mixed condition. The best plea it
can put in is that the 48 Rich Property-owners
can’t be expected to care for the interests of
the country towards the end of a session, and
they certainly don’t—so far, no one has found
them caring for any interests save their own,
either at the end of a session or at any other
time.
Melbourne University Too Much.
Dear Bulletin, —Melb. Age of 10th March
has the following par. :
A circumstantial statement was made at a meeting of
the University council, held on the 3rd ult., by the chan-
cellor, Sir A. C. Brownless, to the effect that “ the
council had refused an offer of .£30,000 from Dr. Grekves
to endow a scholarship for Oddfellows and their sons, and
that the Council had also declined an offer of £20,000 from
Mrs. Cameron to endow a scholarship for pupils from the
Western district.” An anonymous correspondent, signing
himself X.Z., now writes : “How the press came to state
these amounts I do not know, but I do know that the
press is at fault.” Our correspondent ventures to correct
the chancellor's figures, alleging that the amount offered
by Dr. Greeves was only £SOO, and by Mrs. Cameron
£2500.
In The Bulletin of March 14, “J.S.R.” ac-
cuses me of misquoting Chancellor Brownless,
just as “ X.Z.” accuses the Age. It is true
that “X.Z.” does not appear to lay serious
charges about spelling “ Graves ” “ Greeves,”
&c. , but in other respects there is a striking
similarity of tone. But it is of no importance
to the issue really involved whether the Chan-
cellor wrongly put the figures, or whether
“J.S.R.” is identical with “X.Z.” The prin-
ciple allegedly obtaining, “ that every Univer-
sity prize should be open to every student,
without, distinction,” is a mere chimera, be-
cause there are hundreds of students who
are prevented by the University time table
from taking advantage of University education.
Their poverty and the University’s will pre-
vents. As to close scholarships being neces-
sarily objectionable, it is obvious that neither
of the scholarships above-mentioned would
diminish the privileges of any person in the
province, while they would increase the privi-
leges of a few, at the same time bringing in
revenue. The “class” benefited would only
get what was paid for, and the University
would only have another customer for its com-
modity. “ J.S.R.” also says :
Were the University to grant a dozen scholarships to
State scholars only, they would certainly be class scholar-
ships, inasmuch as boys and girls educated at other
schools or at home would not be eligible to compete. No
true democrat would deliberately deprive a very large
section of the population of a share in the advantages of
a public institution half of whose income comes out of the
general revenue.
“ At the end of 1892,” says Coghlan in “ Seven
Colonies, 1894 ” (p. 118), “Victoria had 2140
State-schools, with an average attendance of
141,364 scholars out of a net enrolment of
215,020, or a gross enrolment of 249,786.” The
number of Vic. children in 1891 over five and
under 15 years of age was 244,436. If the
State scholars number 215,000 out of 245,000 it
is hard to determine where we shall find that
very large section of the population that is to be
deprived of its rights by the institution of
scholarships for State-school scholars. The
very fact that the University gets half of
its income out of the State funds, should
make it decently attentive to representations
by properly authorised officials —and Minister
»! Education Peacock may be depended on to
secure this attention. My critic gives a
grotesque distortion of my position in the
following passage :
“ F.” tries to make out that the University does all it
can to keep the working man’s boy down. Does “ F.”
know that a Melb. lady offered four “ Louise ” scholar-
ships of £4O a year each for girls wishing to enter the
medical profession, who had never attended a State school?
Does he know that the University refused them point-
blank? What a howl “ F.” and his like would have set
up had those been accepted !
My letter indicated that I saw no objection to
endowing scholarships for young ladies with
strawberry marks on their left elbows, and
much less objection to permitting special privi-
leges to be bought for young men in Vic.
estern district. In fact, I would have no
objection to a special endowment (paid for by,
say, “ X.Z.”) for the benefit of “ J.S.R.”—F.
The “Unfortunate Shareholder” Again.
Chief among the impudent fictions of James
Williamson —the City of Melbourne Bank
director who stated that “no gentlemen of stand-
ing and principle” would direct banks if they
were prohibited from deciding upon their own
claims to overdrafts—was the fiction that the
money absorbed by his colleagues belonged to the
shareholders, and not to depositors. William-
son is not the originator of this glaring untruth.
It was invented even prior to the reconstruc-
tion period, and served as the excuse for the
accursed Voluntary Liquidation Act of the
James Munro regime. The boomsters’ policy
was to deny as far as possible their responsi-
bility to the real dupes of their false balance-
sheets, and throw themselves upon the mercy
of shareholders, who consisted largely—in some
cases entirely—-of themselves, their relatives,
and friends. Matthew Davies, brother of
J. B. Davies, and pious James Balfour
wept more tears for the unfortunate share-
holders in their Freehold Investment Co.
than they shed for the depositors whose
money had furnished them (the directing
shareholders) with unearned divs. The Federal
and Mercantile Bank magnates, when called
upon to apologise for little indiscretions, mar-
shalled their troops of victims, figuratively
speaking, with the shareholders in the fore-
ground hiding the depositors from view. And
when the Commercial closed its doors and re-
construction became fashionable, the “gag”
which J. Williamson lately inflicted upon
Judge Molesworth was very popular among
financial mummers. Shareholders’ money was
said to have been unfortunately lost, whereas it
was in some cases solidly represented by bricks
and mortar. All that the shareholders did, per
medium of their directors, was to build a head
office and branches with the subscribed capital.
Directors didn’t vote bricks, stonework, and
fittings to themselves and other wholesale
borrowers. They operated upon the de-
posits, the money put into the trap which
the shareholders had constructed, and which
returned handsome dividends to the builders
for many years. The City of Melbourne Bank
shareholders, as a body, will lose by the
failure of their deplorable institution, no doubt,
but a good many of them, having drawn more
out in dividends and overdrafts than they ever
put into it, are emerging from their “ misfor-
fortune ” with a profit. Calls made upon them
now will not be met. On the other hand, all
plain, straightforward depositors will be vic-
timised. They are the people to whom defunct
manager Longmuir and his surviving co-bor-
rowers owe their bank-accounts. Director J.
Williamson had better paste this fact inside
his shiny black belltopper, and read it care-
fully every time he goes to church and mutters
a preliminary prayer into his headgear.
The latest outbreak of the illuminated-address
complaint is almost unique. Some time ago a
Sydney land-shark co. bought an “estate” on
deferred payment and cut it up and sold it,
also on deferred payment. The buyers, mostly
workmen, built houses on it with their savings,
and paid their instalments pretty regularly ;
the co. took the instalments, but it paid neither
principal nor interest to the original vendor.
Therefore, there came a time—as the co. must
have foreseen —when the original vendors started
to sell the property to recover their money,
and that sale meant the ejection of all the small
buyers, the loss of their homes and all the
money they had paid, and their utter ruin.
The situation was so utterly disgraceful that
the directors of the land-shark co. set to work
at last to repair their wicked negligence, and,
after a period of agonising suspense, the
buyers were informed that some kind of a
compromise had been effected, and they
wouldn’t be robbed after all. Then a meet-
ing was held, and gorgeous illuminated
addresses were presented to the directors
because they hadn’t ruined the people who
trusted them but had only come near doing it.
The addresses, in fact, wallowed in gratitude
to the directors because their miserable negli-
gence hadn’t been so disastrous as was expected.
Minister Gould, who presented them, took the
opportunity to make remarks to the effect that
similar accidents had happened before, and that
Parliament had been asked to pass a law to
prevent people selling to other people land they
hadn’t got, and taking the other people’s money,
and then failing to deliver the article paid for
or to return the cash ; but he explained that
Parliament had decided not to interfere with
the swindle lest it should thereby “sap the
independence and self-reliance” of the com-
munity. Then everybody slobbered over every-
body else, and there were votes of thanks and
“ cheers.”
The great difficulty under which Sangster,
M.L.A., labors in proving his Australian coffin-
ship allegations is that all his witnesses are
men who depend for their bread and meat on
the goodwill of the witnesses on the other side.
In other words, whoever gives evidence for him
is thereby giving evidence against somebody
who has power to summarily deprive him of his
means of livelihood for doing it, and it is very
hard to prove any case under such conditions.
Of course, no shipowner or other employer will
“sack ” any man for givingevidence against him,
but in such cases the witnesses for the prosecu-
tion generally “get the run” one by one, very
shortly afterwards, for incapacity, negligence,
or something else, or else they aren’t wanted
owing to scarcity of work, or something hap-
pens to them by the act of God or the Queen’s
enemies in a perfectly natural way that can’t
possibly be proved as animus on the part of the
boss. In this connection one significant inci-
dent occurred last week. A certain officer
whose business it is to see that only
qualified men are supplied as seamen, and
w'ho can consequently run out any man
w'ho, in his view, is not properly qualified,
seems to have been absent from his proper busi- -
ness for a whole week to sit persistently in the
court and watch the inquiry. He didn't inter-
fere with or threaten or intimidate anybody, but
his presence was an automatic reminder to each
nautical witness that he would know him
again, and that if he liked he might thereafter
run him persistently out of every ship in the
harbor as a man who wasn’t properly qualified.
And as there was no visible reason for his pre-
sence unless he was there to take stock of the
witnesses, they naturally, when they saw him,
showed a desire to leave the court by a side-
door and be seen in those parts no more. Under
conditions like these Sangster is engaged in an
uphill fight.
In the Tagliaferro cattle-goring case, at Melb.
Supreme Court, the Judge decided that the
barrier erected to keep the cattle within bounds
was insufficient owing to the negligence of the
captain and the chief officer of the ship, and
that through this insufficiency the plaintiff
(seaman) was injured. But, as here antici-
pated, he decided that, as the captain and chief
officer were fellow-servants of plaintiff, defend-
ants were not liable for their negligence. He
therefore found for defendants “ somewhat un-
willingly, as plaintiff had been injured without
any fault of his own.” The glaring anomaly of
such a law will appear all the more clearly
when it is remembered that if the owners
themselves had personally seen to the erection
of the barrier, they would have bqen liable.
Surely if there is a case where the doctrine of
“ alter ego ” or “ vice-principal ” can come in,
it is in the case of the captain of a ship !
Some democratic sympathy exists in Westralia
for Works-Commissioner Venn, thrown over-
board by Premier Forrest as a sacrifice to the
offended people who couldn’t get rolling-stock.
No doubt Venn’s department is shamefully
mismanaged, and John Forrest told com-
plainants in effect: “Oh, yes, it’s all that
chuckle-headed Venn —what can you expect? ”
Venn stood this for a long time, but at last
grew restive and informed the public that the
complications were wholly due to Forrest,
who cut down the railway estimates after being
informed that more trucks and engines were
absolutely necessary. Forrest was indignant
that one of his subordinate worms should turn,
and when Venn obstinately refused to resign
from the Cabinet he persuaded Gov. Smith to
throw him out. As the Venn crowd is pretty
nearly as mossy a lot of old W. A. shellbacks as
the Forrest crowd, this has led to an eminently
gratifying split among the Six Families. Now
that the Tories have fallen out there is some
chance that the public may come by its own.
Dear Bulletin, —The queries of “D.F.”anent
the uses to which hospital-patients are put “ in
the interests of science ” and the “ upper
classes ” are very pertinent. It is a damnable
thing that in the case of women, suffering from
ailments peculiar to the sex, and, although only
the wives or daughters of working men, as
keenly sensitive as the daughters of luxury,
they should, in scores of cases, be debarred the
privileges of our great institutions, because they
are unable to face the ordeal of an operation
under the eyes of half-a-dozen hard-faced medi-
cal students. Even when examinations are
being conducted, and the subject is not clothed
in chloroform, the students gather about, and
the patient enjoys the felicity of being com-
mented upon exactly as if she were a flayed dog
strapped to the operating-table. I know of
several instances of sufferers preferring to con-
tinue sufferers rather than tender their bodies
to be mauled by doctors for the edification
and enlightenment of a regiment of sucking
sawbones. The preliminary examination is
usually enough and to spare.—G.S.
The Q. elections are wriggling along, and will
continue to wriggle for another fortnight, in
accordance with the tortuous policy of Boodle-
wraith. The strength of parties is now esti-
mated at—Government, 32; Labor, 7 ; and
miscellaneous, 5. Two of these latter call
themselves Opposition members ; two claim to
be Independents ; and one alleges that he is a
Farmers’ Representative. In the Southern
agricultural constituencies half-a-dozen candi-
dates have come forward this time on the
“ farmers’ representative ” ticket, ostenta-
tiously crying “a plague on all your poli-
tical houses; ” but with little luck. In the
Canadian province of Ontario a very substantial
farmers’ party was formed at last elections; and
there is quite a good chance for a similar section
in Q. politics. This year’s candidates, how-
ever, didn’t recommend themselves, being
mostly, like miller Kates, defeated by Labor at
Warwick, shifty Ministerialists in disguise.
As a result of last week’s polling, Labor
barely holds its own. The loss of the
Gympie seat was counterbalanced by a win at
Woolloongabba, but there is a distinct loss of
prestige. It takes all the merit of North Bris-
bane to make up for Townsville and Gympie.
The general issue of the elections promises to
be a Parliament almost identical with the last
in strength of parties. The western and far
northern constituencies, in which is Labor’s
chief reliance, are still to poll—and the Go-
vernment, which put them last on the list in
order that they might have no influence on
weak-kneed brethren, is well aware of it.
The Christian Commonwealth lately com-
plained that no less than nine “ridiculous
and contemptible specimens of the clergy” were
represented on the London stage, and, inasmuch
as every parson is not “a cross between a fraud
and a fool,” the editor laid it down, as a religious
fact, that all stage characters are mischievous
and misleading caricatures. This is base in-
gratitude for past favors. Dramatic authors
have done a lot towards creating an exag-
gerated notion of parsonic manliness and virtue.
A long succession of Irish prastes in Bouci-
caultian dramas were rather mischievous and
misleading—in the opposite direction to that
mentioned by the Christian Commonwealth.
The noble hero of “ The New Magdalen ” was
a curate. Dear, delightful vicars have been
bestowing paternal blessings on the heroine as
long as the oldest playgoer can remember. In
short, prastes, curates, and vicars on the stage
have been, as a rule, sixteen times more truly
Kerristian than the average soul-saver in real
life. It was time for an epidemic of ridiculous
and contemptible specimens to be administered
as a corrective.
Trial by jury is not the perfection of human
reason, but, from trial by Judge, good Lord
deliver us ! Here is an object-lesson from ’Ome.
A certain action under the “ Employers’
Liability Act,” was brought in the County
Court. At the trial, the County Court Judge
—a Judge of fact as well as of law, a Judge-
cwm-jury—held that there was no evidence to
show that defendants were liable. On appeal,
two Justices of the Queen’s Bench upheld this
decision. On some more appeal, three Judges,
the Master of the Rolls, and two Lord Justices,
upheld it again ; one Lord Justice dissenting.
On some more appeal, this time to the House of
Lords, seven Judges—viz., the Lord Chan-
cellor, an ex-Lord Chancellor, and five Lords of
Appeal—disagreed unanimously with the three-
times-affirmed decision and reversed it. The
case sorts out thus : —On one side : A County
Court Judge (theoretically an infallible Judge
of fact), two Justices of the Q. 8., the Master of
the Rolls, two Lord Justices. On the other :
One Lord Justice, the Lord Chancellor, an ex-
Lord C., five Lords of Appeal. The Goddess
of Justice should be thankful she’s blind. She
can toss up for it.
The Lormer Board has sent in its report. It
finds J’s.P. Baxter and Rapiport guilty of
corruption, by taking bribes from litigants.
Also, it finds that old Bird, the gushful, fuzzy
gentleman who met girls at a late hour, for the
purpose of giving them good advice, “adjudi-
cated in the interests of women of bad fame and
character, with whom he had, at the time,
immoral relations.” Likewise, most of the
charges of bench-packing are found proved.
The accusations brought against Lormer are
found not proven ; but the general burden of
the report is that the unpaid J.P. system is a
blot and an infamy, and that the J.P. who
isn’t paid generally pays himself in some way
or other. The Board suggests, as a remedy,
that no J.P. should be allowed to adjudicate
in the courts of Melbourne or its suburbs,
Bendigo, Ballarat, or other large towns.
Outside these towns, he will apparently
be allowed to rage as usual, simply be-
cause the State cannot afford to appoint a
paid magistrate in every separate bush hamlet.
Therefore, the question of allowing the people
to elect their own honorary “ beak,” where the
honorary “ beak ” is inevitable, again crops up.
It other words, the question is whether the
bush J.P. should be elected for a fixed term by
the people who know him and who have to
suffer from his ignorance and incapacity if they
el ect an unfit person, or if he should be ap-
pointed by an authority in the capital, which
authority doesn’t know' him, and doesn’t suffer
by him, and has a direct interest in appointing
a bad man if he is a political supporter rather
than a good man who isn’t.
The Bulletin has received the following letter
from Maoriland re an article published some
time ago on the subject of Chinese girl mis-
sionaries :
Editor Bulletion. —Sir, —It is with fellings of panfm

This is the orthodox person all over. He never
proves or attempts to prove that his opponent
is wrong. He has no facts and no logic. If
anybody doesn’t agree with him he simply
waves his hair in the blast and says on his own
sole authority that that person will be damned.
The Bulletin will be glad to hear any facts
which its correspondent can adduce to show
that its view of the Chinese mission subject was
incorrect, but it flatly refuses to be damned by
Peter M‘Faklane or any other unauthorised
person who says that it will be chewed by
“ Bares.”
The Man that’s Dead.
(Respectfully dedicated to the directors of a certain Bank.)
The bank was broke and they all agreed
That somehow the money had fled away—
Had fled like a spirit that death had freed
From its tabernacle of earthly clay.
So they figured the lost coin up and said
That the assets were “ shook ” by the man
that’s dead.
They all agreed the accounts were mixed,
Though no one knew how it came to be ;
And no one could tell how the books were fixed
Or who was the cause of the mystery.
For these bulky tomes bound in brown and red
Had been muddled and mixed by the man that’s
dead.
They mostly had overdi’afts large or small,
Or middle-sized, as the case might be,
And these overdrafts, taking them all in all,
Were built on most shaky security.
And the board resolved that the coin it lent
To itself, and which it had “ blewed ” and
spent,
Had quite unaccountably melted and fled
Through the shameful neglect of the man that’s
dead.
The big reserve-fund was wholly gone,
Like last year’s dew on the wattle-tree ;
The capital went like a ghost at dawn,
The bills were as bad as such things could
be ;
And naught remained but a bad, bad smell,
For the big stone bank was an empty shell ;
So a sad, wet tear the directors shed
O’er the wickedness of the man that’s dead.

There is a Westralian claim called the
United Scotchman. Tautology ! The Scotchman
is always united.
Mrs. Arthur Kitson, formerly of Sydney,
has recovered <£12,000 (another account says
<£1200) damages from Dr. W. S. Playfair, of Lon-
don, who divulged secrets acquired during the
course of his professional duties which were
alleged to reflect on her character. The Bulletin
doesn’t remember any other case of the kind where
a doctor was concerned.
A N.S. Wales father who went to a dance
and left five little children alone in the house with
a lighted candle—and the usual result (all burnt
to death)— is quoted as telling a reporter that “ he
lost everything he possessed in the world. He
puts down the money value of his house and
effects at <£2oo. . . . He was fearfully cut up
at the loss not only of his property —he said he
would not have cared so much for that—but his
children. This was the heaviest blow.” Some
people—or some reporters—have a queer sense of
congruity.
The despatch of an Egyptian military force
to Dongola is about the boldest piece of British
foreign statesmanship since Disraeli’s time. It
displeases the German Government. Now is
Premier Salisbury’s time for “rubbing it into”
the Germans, who have discovered that their
chance of a military gain by a war with Great
Britain is small in comparison with the certainty
of a commercial disaster. And, though France
is also furious, the mutual antagonism of France
and Germany makes the move a pretty safe one.
Q. Ministerialists are aggrieved because
aftor Eidsvold election their opponents are alleged
to have chased and maltreated Govt, voters. The
ruling Q. party has murdered (per its Kanakas and
other colored laborers) 17 men in the last three
years: it has outraged several women and com-
mitted numberless assaults per the same medium ;
it lias infected the white population with leprosy;
it has robbed thousands of their votes; it has
discreditably manoeuvred the public funds and
demoralised political life; and now its supporters
complain because some bard words and a blow or
two pass in an election row !
The railway has reached Coolgardie at last,
and the opening was celebrated by five days of
awful official drunk and a universal hiccup that
blew sand-clouds out of the town east, west, north
and south. The train with the Government on
1 Hiard bumped in only four hours late, which was
Imld to augur well for the success of the line, and
the Ministers were met by an admiring crowd
which groaned and called rut “Rats!” A great
procession of drunks, dry-blowers, unemployed,
Afghans, camels, Chows, ladies of doubtful
character, publicans, and niggers escorted the
Governor into the town, and five leading Afghans
presented him with an address. A great political
meeting was held at which it was unanimously
agreed that the Ministry was a bloated fraud, and
the rest of the proceedings were mainly hard
drinking, profanity, dog-fights, and general uproar
through the length and breadth of the city of
bagging and galvanised iron. Also, there \yere the
usual speeches about “ the resourees of this great
country ” —a phrase which should oe put down by
act of Parliament.
One of the pleasantest, coolest, most
central and best-appointed restaurants in Sydney
is the Manhattan Dining Room, situated in the
basement of the great Equitable Building in
George-street, Sydney. It is in the middle of the
busiest portion of Sydney, and is in every respect
a high-class establishment with good cooking, good
attendance, a lavish bill of fare, and luxurious
fittings and furnishings.*

Sydney, March 31, 180 G.
Mr Dear Moorabtnda—
The team of (alleged) cricketing M’sP. from the
Cabbage Garden spent a festive week in Sydney,
but the ostensible “ raison ” of their jovial raid—
the cricket-match between N.S.W. and Vic. legis-
lators—was quite the most scamped item on their
programme. “Luncheon” was a protracted in-
terval, and consequently the farce-cricket was a
sur.ces de rire, at all events. From the loosely-
filled members’ stand echoes of Lauri’s famous
laugh in “ Nitoucho ” went up continuously, and
the gathering was so infectiously happy that fat,
top-hatted legislators shook their sides with appar-
ently causeless laughter.
The inter-Parliamentary cricket-match was a
most hilarious gathering—shockingly managed, so
far as the lady-visitors went (I took the neglect
as an augury that one-petticoat-one-vote is still in
the dim distance), but evidently a veritable
triumph of masculine hospitality. Perhaps the
most significant bit of by play daring the after-
noon was when a burly local M ( > . inarched into
the field with what the initiated call a “long-
sleever ” of—well, it might have been water —and
placed it on the grass within sight of the players
much as one holds out carrots to a pet horse. That
beckoning goblet supplied the keynote of the day’s
athletics.
Anrvnos politics—a deputation of Sydney tabbies
waited on Colonial Secretary lirunker the other
day, and held forth at length on their favorite
theme, “the age of consent.” The deputation
included 28 matrons and one spinster—all, appa-
rently, versed in the unsavory subject—and they
swooped d >wn under the aagis of .Mr. M'Miilan,
who said, hesitatingly that this was a matter of
great importance, but he would prefer the ladies
should mike their own representations. Then
the She-Gimletists waded in.
The deputation confessed, as a start, that it had
read the Maiden Tribute articles “ with great in-
terest.” Of course. There’s not much “spicy”
realism a “ Y ” woman misses, so long as it’s de-
scribed in a horrified but explicit tone, with names
and dates, and a parson’s picture on the top. 'I hen
a grim lady arose and remarked that they had
Come in the interests of trie lower classes more
than those of the higher—which was a tremendous
slur on the poor but virtuous, though I am willing
to believe the Giniletists would gladly exploit the
morals of the rich folks, too, if only they weren’t
sure of having gilded portals banged on their in-
ouisitive noses. It is one of poverty’s greatest
drawbacks that you are liable to have a areadful
female rushing into your humble cot and anxiously
inuuiring if your daughter is as good as she ought
to be. However, this assurance from head-quar-
ters that the social-purists mean to maintain their
masterly inactivity with regard to the morals of
I’otts Point, may be comforting news for ttas-
siety.
This seems to be the season for reforming people
off the face of the earth. The Council of the
Churches in Sydney held a conference on gambling
the other day, when one reverend youth appeared
to me to hit the bull’s-eye in saying that it was
first of all necessary for the church to cleanse her-
self, and he hoped for a pronouncement from the
heads of the church against lotteries and raffles
being permitted at bazaars. That’s just it. While
the little tin gee-gees are allowed to tear around
the cardboard course at church fairs in order to
nut a new chasuble on the vicar, l don’t quite see
how the clergy can reasonably object to the Tote.
And until the lucky-bag, fish-pond, spinning-
jenny, and other games of chance are heard of no
more in ecclesiastical circles I don’t quite see how
Mr. Chadband can jump with a clear conscience
on the worldling who backs his fancy. But the
watery church-bazaar will pan out a still more in-
significant div. than usual if they really take away
the lotteries and hunt out the fortune-tellers, and
insist on the flower-girls washing the paint off
their lips—but I don’t think they will. Unless
the church has something tricky in Society ser-
pentining or an entirely new and startling array of
living pictures up its full bishop’s sleeves, I am
afraid the Reformation is still a long way ahead.
Apropos parsons—a very, very free-and-easy
Sydney cleric, who used to make life hideous for
the joily Jack Tars when in port, always hunting
them up to services of sacred song, tea-and-scone
struggles, and secular entertainments, at which
t'.ie rawest talent in town would rend the air
with shrill songs or breathless recitations —1 hear
that this giddy philanthropist has turned up at the
Cape. Sailormen are therefore advised to look
out for themselves on Africa’s coral strand, or he
may catch ’em a<pin with black vocalists and
cocoanut suppers this time.
The first concert of the 15th season of .Sydney
Liedertafel was a reviving incident in Sydney
Town Hall. Vice-royalty occupied the centre of
the wide half-circle of patronage —placed as usual
in the very teeth of the music—but 1 suppose by
this time they know enough to put wadding in
their ears. I was rather amused at the way the
patrons had arranged themselves —all the men on
the one side like a synagogue, though, to be sure,
the president’s charming wife, who re-appeared in
Society for the first time (in a chiffoiiey-looking
white gown and diamonds) after her long )>eriod
of mourning, was sitting next to His Excellency,
and so broke the line of black coats. Lady
Hampden wore a matronly turn-out and a feather
in her hair, and the three vice-regal damsels were
in heliotrope and white. The stage was gracefully
dressed with feathery verdure, and the immense
audience had a bow in its hair, generally speaking.
By the wav, a group of girls with bows in their
hinder locks were so arranged that the effect of
the said bows was exactly that of the Southern
Cross, looking down from the gallery. Is this
going to be a fatality in Australian decoration ?
The Liedertafel sang with all the ease of vocalists
who have been rested during the summer and are
conscious that their voices are as fresh as their
shirt-fronts. The long, heavy item, “ The Luck
of Kdenhall,” was, T suppose, above criticism, as
the score was given to the society, and one must
not look a gift horse in the mouth. At any rate,
it was a good ad. for the lung powers of the
Liedertafeilers, who were in inspiriting form all
through the concert, and, with the Liedertafel
orchestra, made the real successes of the neatly-
compiled programme. Miss Ilossow and Signor
de Beau puis were the extraneous talent lending
variety to the show. Miss Rossow (who is going
’Ome) wore a canary-colored frock, and sang her
songs in a high, clear, but somewhat nasal soprano
and got wild encores for each number. Du
Beaupuis, of the horse's fetlock, contributed piano
soli.
A now contralto. Mrs. Truscott, made her debut
at Lawrence Campbell’s elocutionary and musical
entertainment at Sydney VALC.A. the other
Thursday. The stage was rigged up with sulphur-
yellow hangings, the contralto wore a tomato-red
frock, and her gown and the yellow draperies
made up into a blow between the eyes. The only
thing l liked about Mrs. T. is that I am sure she
doesn't intend going 'Ome on her vo ce, which is a
rather hard and not very big contralto of ordinary
compass. Besides Lawrence Campbell’s versatile
recitations, which were the most popular items on
the programmes, there were organ and piano solos
by Miss Lilian Frost, songs by a nervous, throaty
vocal tyro, cud a lovely nocturne by Edgar cello
Strauss which atoned for all raw places observable
on the bill
The much -anticipated “ Djin Djin,” which broke
out at Sydney Lyceum last Saturday, proved a
success of satin and scenery set to airy, friendly
music, and seasoned with legs and low comedians.
It seems just the spectacle for the festive Easter
season, when the hairy individual who has g<me-
cn the-land-young-man comes to town for the
horse-show, and really needs a large, gorgeous
spendthrift entertainment like “Djin Djin ” to
plaster over the arid places in his mortgaged and
grass-grown soul. The dresses, i'i Ut Jolly Japan,
are very tine—all of them, except the golden ballet,
being from designs by Mr. \V. R. Barnes, of
Melbourne, who displays his maiden attempt at
frock-planning in these expensive garments, and
who, I hear, shortly goes ’Ome. The scenery
broke the artistic and gorgeous record, Gordon
getting the lion’s share of applause—though 1
liked a realistic bamboo grove (Goatcher) as well
as anything. It wasn’t gorgeous, of course, but
the long stems and the silvery foliage wore ad-
mirably expressed. One could almost hear it
rustling.
Flo Young, as Prince Eucalyptus (the gorge of
this paper rises at the bare notion of the possi-
bility of such a title), cut a fine figure in a blaok-
and-silver pot-up, with hair poudre and a
“ Sappho ” hat—though black-and-silver always
reminds one of coffin-plates. Her second suit of
cinnamon-brown cloth and green velvet with
round cap and Home Rule hose also suited her to
aT. Flora Graupner was handsomely done as
the Princess Iris, her chiefest efforts being white
satin painted with purple irises and a pmk-and-
white satin brocade combination, the colors melt-
ing into one another like eoooanut-ice; but tle
tiny Flora hasn’t enough “ shop front on which
to display such goods to the fullest advantage.
However, her smallness enhanced the manly
stature of Flo Young, who cuddles her in a man-
ner that many a male beginner might do worse
than imitate.
The dainty danseuse, Mary Weir, seemed rather
wasted as Dede, with only one hoppy dance to
do, but her chief robe of pink brocade and Bur-
gundy velvet was fetching, and she toddled like a
native. The Fairy Queen was the Melbourne ex-
amateur, Miss Orelli, who is probably the nrst
impossibly-blonde fairy to take to the stage in her
very own undyed hair. Miss Orelli’s warble is a
sweet, though not extraordinary, soprano, but she
was too unaccustomed, on Saturday, to turn it full
on at the tap. The ballet-dresses (I believe they
go by that name) were sportive flights of fancy,
especially the Snow ballet, with white Jack 1 rost
caps and muffs ; though I confess the I' loral ballet
was garish in places, especially a green girl out-
lined in scarlet, like lettuce garnished with toma-
toes. I liked the whirling Umbrella ballet, under
the dome of lanterns— it was quite a valuable
object-lesson to those people who manage to catch
your back-hair on their gamps, even when there
are only two of von in the street; and a crowd of
youngsters fluttering about looked like butterflies
in a garden.
One thing surprises me in the low, not to say
vulgar, comedian who dresses up as a woman— he
always omits to pad himself where his Bloomers
ought to widen out. Surely this is a great over-
sight on the part of one who leaves no stone un-
turned to make a realistic sketch. I notice,
by the way, that the man-woman of the stage
deteriorates in the flight of ages. The Widow
T wan key, if you remember, was gav and frisky,
yet you felt she had some rude notions of self-
respect; but the latest he-female loiters in public
places and is wholly objectionable. I am sorry
for this fall from grace on the part of the he-she-
comcdian, who doesn't seem half so funny in the
new edition.
On dit that a certain Premier has made his
memory accursed throughout the stable-yards of
at least one northern district because, after being
driven miles and back behind the usual circus-
team of greys, he, on departing, tipped the groom
one shilling while that pampered menial was
counting on ten at least. But, lie should be thank-
ful for his luck —Premier Gillies only gave one
penny to a waiter. So it is recorded. If a Premier
who is poor did everything on the ten-shilling
scale ho wouldn't have enough cash to get his
laundry - bill receipted. After all, there are
precious few ha’pence in being a Minister of the
Grown. lam told that tiv the time an ordinary
Minister at -aMoOO jy-r annum (minus deductions)
has paid all tolls, charges and subscriptions, lie
has about .£7OO a 3 T e*r to live on. One can't help
wondering, then, why people become Ministers.
Chiefly though van.tv, I suppose. It is, as a
rule, only the second rate, cotton-one-way sort of
youth whom you find grafted on to professional
politics.
Sydney intends to send Miss Colboume-Baber
off to Fugland with hip-hip-hooray, judging by
the enthusiasm of the flown Hall meeting held to
arrange preliminaries of the complimentary fare-
well. Miss Baber uas never refused to lift up her
voice in the cause of charity, and if she reaps as
she has sown the farewell must be a bumper.
St. Vincent’s Ball, next Wednesday (April Xth),
at Sydney Town Hah, looks as if 'twould be the
ball of the year. The committee reports that the
tickets are selling like bicycles, and people who
can u hold their own in a crowd are advised to
keep away. A poultry supper- alas for the gross-
ness of this world ! is one of the attractions. On
1 lie-day next the Agricultural ball will happen.
On dr that the decorations for this new dance are
going to be something artistic not unconnected
with cobs of corn. It looks very handsome on the
part of the Agricultural Society—their bequeath-
ment of trimmings to St. Vincent's ball the next
e\ en ng. One is not accustomed to such magnani-
mity between ball committees, who usually tight
tO r a finish. In the undyingly active secretary
Webster the Society has got hol'd of a diplomatist.
Sydney sailing men mean to receive Gov.
Brassey with full nautical honors, and next
Saturday, April 11, every species of craft from
steam yachts to canvas dingies will be racing for
dear life up and down the harbour in honor of the
V ictonan Gov. A strong sub committee of well-
known yachting-men has the affair in hand, and
the Brassey regatta will practically end the sailing
season with a brilliancy equal to fireworks.
A new horror is observable in connection with
suburban mayoresses who are launching out into
otheial at-homes with free drinks and hand music
like the big mayoral receptions seen through the
wrong end of one s opera-glasses. A mayoress in
a W ostern suburb set the fashion last week. I
hear that the gnawmg fear of local munieipaldom
vas that there wouldn’t be enough people to eat
the retreshment, but, of course, the presentiment
uas groundless; the lady had quite a bumper
house, and not a bun left over for the parrot. But
the worst of it is that other mayoresses will fl.Jow
suit. I o stand by a pot-plant, with a street band

The Wild-Celt Column.
The Colonial Mutual, which ranks after the
A.M.P. and Maoriland .State Life Department as the third
largest life assurance office in Australasia, has finished a
good year. The premium income for ’95 was £803,983,
and £89,703 interest on investments made the total in-
come 4393,6-6. The death and endowment claims were
£121,3-14, nearly £BO9O less than last year; and £130,206
was added to the funds, making the splendid total of
£1,923,835. The working expens s are £77,583, equal to
2.) 4 per cent, on premiums, or about 19|j per cent, on the
total income. Despite the bad times, therefore, the
Colonial Mutual has El2uo more income than it had last
year ; its expenses, which have been gradually diminish-
ing for a number of years, have again declined, and have
now, for the first time in the society’s history, got below
2o per cent, of the gross income ; and the amount saved
out of the year's revenue, after allowing for sums
written off, is about £4OOO more than it was in ’94.
The assets also look better than they did a year
or two ago. “ Government and other debentures ” re-
present £163,666, which is £lOO,OOO more than they were
at the beginning of 94, and, considering the general ten-
dency to run too much into the treacherous mortgage
business, this is a move in the right direction. “ Rents
and interest outstanding and accrued ” are only £17,705,
against £55,0u0 two years ago—which is another great
improvement, and if the society would divide up this
item, as many other offices are now doing, and show ex-
actly how much rent and interest are in arrear, and how
far they are in arrear, and also embody in the auditors’
certificate a plain statement tiiat all the arrears taken
credit for are in this item, and none of them, by
any chance, included among the mortgages, it would make
a further distinct improvement. Also, concerning a small
item, “preference shares, £12,710” (presumably bank
shares), it would be gratifying to know that these' shares
are taken at present selling-price, and not at nominal
values. The Colonial Mutual's balance-sheet is very satis-
factory in most respects, hut still, like most such docu-
ments, it might he a trifle more explicit.
Why do not the Australasian life offices follow
the example of, say, the New York Life, in the matter of
their assets? That office publishes a list of all bonds,
debentures, and shares held by the society, showing their
book-values and their present selling-price, and every
separate item of its freehold and leasehold property, with
the value set a ainst each item. Under these conditions
any seriously inflated estimates can hardly fail to attract
the attention of somebody. It also gives a list of its mort-
gages with the estimated present value of the properties
mortgaged as compared with the amount lent. The
policy of keeping strictly dark about details, followed by
the Australasian insurance societies, doesn’t pay in the
long run.

The dreadful Real Estate Bank (Melbourne)
reports that the liabilities are c 1,229,333, or, leaving out
the shareholders’ capital, which is wholly gone, the amount
still owing to depositors and others' is £584,713. The
assets are reported as worth £23,636, and, considering the
pathetic smallness of the amount, one dismal liquidation
should he presently finished and the name of Munro’s in-
stitution be dropped into oblivion.

The National Mutual Life Association has
£169,694 to divide as the profits of the last three years.
Of this amount £85,090 goes to policy-ho’ders, providing
reversionary bonuses to the extent of about £200,060;
£70,000 goes to the reserve for depreciation of securities,
and £14,694 is carried forward. The £70,000 reserve for
depreciation makes a big hole in the bonus, but the wis-
dom of this move is unquestionable. In these days the
securities have such a dismal tendency to fall in value,
that large reserves are absolutely necessaiy. It is a
question now between large bonuses and a fair chance
of ultimate burst or smaller bonuses and safety, and
the first object of every life office should be safety. And
with this object in view there is a fair chance that the
bonuses will have to get still smaller before any improve-
ment sets in.

S.A. State Land Bank has started business by
iss ling at Adelaide £50,000 worth of 3.J per cent, bonds to
provide funds for loans, ful l her issues to follow when
more funds are required. This scheme is vastly more
business-like than that adopted in Maoriland. The M.L.
State Land Bank started by issuing a L 1,500,000 loan in
London, and as only about one-third of this amount has
been lent, the balance is costing the State in the mean-
time some 430,000 a year in interest to no purpose.

The Farmers’ Co-operative Fire and Marine In-
surance Co. (M.L.), though only five years old, seems to
be doing well. Last year it scooped in £6217 in premiums
and £2898 interest on investments, and its losses were
only £756. The total profit was £43lo—a figure wh'ch
must make many a luckless co. feel bad with envy ; and,
alter paying 6 per cent, to shareholders, returning 10
per cent, of shareholders’ premiums and carrying £lOOO
to reserves (making £2675), it has still a small balance left.

The United Australian Fire Insurance Co.
reports that its premium income for the year was £18,105
(about £5OO more than in ’O4), and the profit, after writing
off £893 for depi»ciation of securities, £2102. A 6 per
cent. div. absorbs £lBB4, and the b dance goes to profit
and loss, making it £2236. The United Australian has
been 16 years in existence, and hasn't even got a reserve-
fund started. Also, it has got a £27,000 mortgage on its
office property in Melbourne and Sydney—value of pro-
perty not stated, as it is lumped in with the “loans on
mortgage.” Its premium income is smaller than it was in
1887, and the amount received as interest on investments
is £699, whereas in 1887 it was £1570. Its investments
yield only 2 per cent, net on their alleged value, which is
a serious e lection on the alleged value, or on some-
th in g con in cted with them, and despite this state of things
the co. a vear ago paid away in dividend £5OO more than
its year’s receipts. The U. A. is a fine example of the hand-
to-mouth office which never seems to get any further
forward.

The Equitable Life Assurance Society of New

expansion of this colossal institution, whose business
keeps growing larger and larger through good times and
bad with unfailing regularity. It is announced that the

as did those which fell due in ’95, which, considering the
fall in the rate of interest and the general depression, is
highly satisfactory. * , *
Last year the value of coal exported from New-
castle (N.S.W.) was only £678,000. In 1891 the exports
were worth £1,160,000.
In 1890 the butter imports of the United King-
dom increased by 493,000 cwt. over those of 1893, and
Lb ,ooOcwt. of this was supplied by Victoria. The rest of
the Australias, put together, only increased their exports

Out of every eight fat men in Vic. Legislative
Council five are directors of one or more financial institu-
tions. Some of them are six-fold directors. Hence the
“° llnc 9 complaint voiced by J. William son at the City of
Melb. Bank enquiry, that “ no gentleman of standing and
principle ” will care to take office under the proposed
New Companies Act, which prohibits him from recklessly
operating on the firm’s till.

The peculiarity of the City of Melbourne Bank
case, as well as that of the Federal Bank of Australia and
the Mercantile Bank, is that no criminality on the part
of the directors has been m im'/este l,” says Smellbourne
Arous. Truthfully speaking, the peculiarity is not in the
cases, but in the interpretation of the precious Victorian
law. Criminality is a relative term. Some countries
recognise the burial of a live widow with her dead hus-
band as a strictly legal proceeding. Had the three banks
aforesaid been born in London, instead of Melbourne, the
Arous might have viewed one or more of the directorates
in quite a different light.

In the New Chum and Morning Star, which
latter includes the Easter Gift, Mount Magnet, W.A. (says
Geraldton Express) has two properties that for over two

New Chum, with a fair supply of stone, averages soz.
and over to the ton ; the Morning Star, with an im-
mense body of formation, which runs through the bat-
tery like sand, averages slightly under loz. to the ton.
Both these mines have declared enormous dividends com-
pared with the amount of labor employed. The dividends
have not been disclosed, but have been sliced up quietly
among the shareholders in buying machinery and other

If the Great Boulder is ever to pay back the
present market-value of its shares, saying nothing about
paying any interest on them, it will need to turn out 12A
tons of goid. And that is reckoning the expenses on the
narrowest possible margin.
* » • *
Stated that the Boulder—shares on their way
towards £8 at time of writing—could double its output
if it had the water and plant. With 2)0 men at work and
only crushing 209 to 309 tons fortnightly, the mine must
have an enormous accumulated tonnage at grass, or is
doing something extraordinary in the way of develop-
ment. Oti one hand it is said that the soz. and 6oz. stuff
is carefully dressed, and that the lode, beyond the shadow
of a doubt, is poorer below 150 ft. ; on the other, that the
ore is crushed as it is broken, and it is as rich at 209 ft. as
anywhere Anyhow, it is time that the public suspicion
on this point was removed by an official statement of
details. The Boulder is Lane’s magnificent mistake—it
can’t be forgotten that his original report of it was by no
means so glowing as those he made on other mines—the
Empress of Coolgardie to wit.
The Lake View lode is said to be as rich and
strong as ever 50ft. below the solid diorite.

Londonderry, 82 loads for 2G7oz. fldwt., is about

Editor Bulletin, — Re a recent par. in your
paper concerning jewellery-canvassers and the necessity
for their holding licenses as hawkers. A friend of mine
bought s ime jewellery from one of the fraternity, paying
10s. deposit. The principal repudiated the sale, and de-
manded the articles back, stating that the canvasser or
dealer had no instructions from him to sell anything. My
friend saw a lawyer, and was advised he would have to
return the articles, and could make no claim for what he
had paid. Now, if this canvasser had been licens3d, a
purchaser would have been protected to a great extent;
as it is, if a principal repudiates a sale, the buyer has no
claim on the sub-dealer.

are at present quite helpless in the matter. They have
the choice of an investing solicitor who may be a gambler
on stock exchange or turf, or even a regular church-goer,
or of a bank which will probably go bung, or of a trustee
co. which may possibly depend on an uncalled capital—
uncallable when it is wanted. With a luilic Trustee

little enough wage for a journeyman baker, but
that, if the sweater cannot be stifled, nothing less

extent covered, and the new edition has undergone

Gov. Brassey’s yacht Sunbeam arrived in
Sydney harbor the other day, with the millionaire
Governor—six millions is said to be about the
figure—himself on board, also madame and various
appendages. Comparing the accounts published,
■this loyal paper prefers, on the whole, the achieve-
ment of the Telegraph scribe, who gives most
details about the bedrooms and the bathrooms. A
lot of people like to read about lords’ bedrooms
and bathrooms. Generally speaking, the bedrooms
on the Sunbeam lie “ along a white lincrusta-lined
passage, past the bright and spotless little engine-
room ”:
Here is Lord Brassey’s dressing-room, remarkable for
the ingenious manner in which space has been utilised.
Opposite is a bath-room, all enamelled red for photo-
graphic purposes. . . . Beyond is a roomy white cabin
with wide brass bedstead and multitudes of little
drawers. . . . Lord Richard Neville’s cabin is next,
notable for some very fine etchings. . . . Lady Bras-
sey’s boudoir is a charming little room on deck. . . .
From here a stairway leads down to Lord and Lady
Brassey’s room, exactly beneath, with its big square bed-
stead. . . . The floor lifts up, and discloses a bath,
completely equipped, beneath.
The great Australian daily which knows its busi-
ness always sends a specialist round to poke a
Governor’s mattresses with a wise air and an
umbrella, and to peer into his cupboards, and to
lift up his trap-doors, and to smell his tooth-
brush. The great heart of this young demo-
cracy demands these things.

is true, but if charity covers a multitude of sins it
doesn’t abrogate the law, and The Bulletin calls
upon the pietists who have been so hot against,
charging for admission to theatres on the blessed
“ Sawbath ” to have a go at His Excellency.
Gov. Brassey was the other day invited to
visit a Castlemaine exhibition of exceeding great
turnips and oleaginous swine, and gratefully
accepted. Then along came an intimation from
Castlemaine Council that that body was on its
official uppers, and felt itself unequal financially
to the task of entertaining his Lordship as the
representative of Her Gracious should be enter-
tained ; wherefore it was hoped his Ex. would
repress his mad longing to visit Castlemaine till
the Council had saved up enough to buy bottled
beer and biscuits and cheese, also a new hat, and
to get its other shirt washed, and dust the town,
and fix things up generally. The Governor sorrow-
fully withdrew hvs acceptance of the invitation,
and the swelled melon, and the ram of ancient
lineage, also the prize poley-cow, are said to have
felt their loss keenly on missing the opportunity
of being informed by His Excellency that he
understood that their great joy on seeing him was
not for himself alone, but a manifestation of their
affection for their Gracious Queen and that dear
land, &c., &c.

Gov. Brassey’s want of tact is proverbial.
The unjovial mariner rolled up to a Melbourne
school function the other week, without the
slightest knowledge of the name of the principal,
his host. Before troubling to enquire as to the
identity of the person who had invited him to
lunch and speechify, His Ex. grabbed the hand of
caterer Skinner, and engaged him in a long yarn.
He knew Skinner, anyway, in connection with
chicken and champagne, and was probably moved
to congratulate him upon the quantity of refresh-
ments present. After which H.E. was heard
enquiring, in a ponderous stage-whisper, for infor-
mation re the giver of the feast. The Baron is
“ bad form.”

Premier Kingston’s unruly members aren’t
all in his Ministerial following. In referring to
his eternal dispute with the Adelaide hospital
management he so far unbridled his tongue as to
call one member of the lion, medical staff a “medi-
cal Jack the Ripper.” Consequence : Resignation
of the staff and many of the members of the
board of management—only appointed the other
day, after the Nurse Gordon riots.

Brassey’s faith in his own greatness is such
that he allowed his under-study. Chief Justice
Madden, to act a part in the Equitable Insurance
Society show at Melbourne last week. The Gover-
nor stumbled through a few opening remarks, and
finished up with a string of himperial platitudes,
spoken from memory with his eyes cast down in
the manner of one who is reading something from
a slate. Presently the Chief Justice took the
floor, head erect, cheerfully conscious of his Irish
fluency, and proceeded to extinguish the vice-
regal effort. Madden took up the rdle of advocate,
or chief canvasser, for the E. 1.5., in which, by the
way, he has a warm policy interest. It was sweet
to hear him “barrack,” whilst the clerical staff of
the institution stood around remarking that
Madden’s speech was worth a couple o’ ’undred
pounds to the business if it was worth a penny.

The little coal-mining township of Brunner,
on the west coast of the south island of Maoriland,
has achieved the sad fame of Creswick and Bulli.
By a gas explosion in the Brunner colliery, on
March 2(i, about GO miners were entombed, and,
though rescue parties toiled night and day to re-
lease them, the lives of all were lost.
Premier Seddon has been down the shaft with
the rescue-party, and offered to “do a shift him-
self, if necessary.” As there was plenty of trained
help available, and stout Seddon isn’t any longer
in the condition of a trained man, it obviously
wasn’t necessary ; and, considering the imminence
of the M.L. general-election, the offer might just
as well have been omitted. However, these con-
siderations may not have presented themselves to
the Premier, in the excitement of his manly
enthusiasm.
Even over such a terrible disaster is trailed the
slime of “patronage.” Gov. Glasgow has “con-
sented to become the patron of the relief fund.”
The “ patron ” of a spontaneous national impulse
to help distressed widows and orphans ; the bait
for Mrs. Grundy’s advertising guineas ; grotesque
conjunction ! Bid those agonised women at the
pit-mouth cease wringing their despairing hands !
Hearts are thrilling with sympathy for them, eyes
are filling with tears, men are risking their lives in
the work of rescue—“under the patronage of Gov.
Glasgow ! ”
A sturdy, prolific lot were those Brunner miners.
the list of names you read “ ten
children,” “nine children,’ “seven children,”
“ five children ” —hardly ever “two children” or
“onechild.” One man had a family of 12, the
eldest only 16 ! “He had lost his wife some
months ago.”
Comparatively blessed is the woman whose
husband is killed with 50 or 60 other women’s
husbands in a mining disaster ; for, in that event,
she is sure to be more or less provided for. But
if her husband were killed alone or slowly
petered out ’ through disease aided by starvation
she herself could follow suit as far as the public is
concerned. Advertisement and sensation and
patronage” are the life of Charity.
In point of sales the recent Sydney Artists’
Exhibition was but a moderate success—all Aus-
tralian art exhibitions are, from that standpoint,
but moderately successful. Only a couple of dozen
pictures, and those mostly very low-priced ones,
were disposed of.
The late official re-
port on Sydney street
noises confines itseh, un-
fortunately, to the racket
made by vehicular traffic.
Would it not be possible
to pass an Act or frame
a municipal by-law which
would cover all preven-
table noises by day or
night ? In many Euro-
pean towns piano-playirrr
after 10 p.m. is a legal
offence; in many places
in America the owner of
a yelping dog is liable to
fine. Australia’s reverence
for the liberty of one or
a few subjects acts as a
tyranny over the many.

object of bathing in the
Werribee at the “cross-

The police found deposit-
receipts for ,£1047 on this

A sentence from a
Sydney daily paper re
the phthisical cattle offered
locally for auction : “ The
seller offers his cattle for
consumption.” But it
should read: “The seller
offers his consumption for
cattle.”
The Sydney Irish Rifles, it seems, are v<>t
to be the “Irish Rifles,” but the “Union Volun-
teer Regiment.” What humorist is responsible
for this designation ? or was the “ Dis ” omitted
by accident? or was “the Governor with the
advice,” etc., afraid to trust the Hibernian
warriors with an appellation from which every
vestige of green hadn’t been carefully excluded ?

The other day, in the back-country, All
Cow, from China, married Mary Eliza Smith,
whereupon Mary Eliza’s justly-incensed brother
advertised in the marriage-column of the local
paper : “ At Billy-Billy, 20th March, Ah Cow to
Mary Eliza Smith. Aged 22 years.”

About half the ladies who followed
M'Millan in the appeal to Colonial Sec. Branker
to raise the age of consent in N.S.W. are natives
of Scotland, where, The Bulletin believes, it is
still the law that a girl can marry at 12 years of
age without her parents’ consent.
* * * *
The “age of consent ” being only 16 in
England, where girls mature late, why should it
be 18 in semi-tropical N.S. Wales, as proposed by
the Social Gimlet Brigade ?

Dear Bulletin, —You got home when you
Webstered dancing “a fleshly spree.” So, also,
are church picnics and the other social enjoyments
where the sexes play and paw and fool with each
other. Frequently carried beyond the moderation
of virility, this, too, becomes a sexual excess—
which is immorality. Dancing has, at least, the
merit of being graceful. Ponder this, ye saints !

Henniker Heaton, remarks Sydney D.T.’s
interesting London correspondent, has, through
his Parliamentary return of divorces in Great
Britain, Europe, and the colonies, ascertained that
N.S. Wales is the “divorciest” of British depen-
dencies. The number of divorces granted in 1894
in Great Britain was 230, whereas in N.S. Wales
391 divorces were granted in the same year. Yet
the population of England exceeded 30,000,000,
and the population of N.S. Wales was about one
million ! Now that people know that the marriage-
knot can be easily loosed in Botany Bay, it is
anticipated that the tide of emigration will flow
freely in that direction.

According to St. James's Gazette, Hogan’s
Legitimation Bill is only intended to smooth the
way for colonial dignitaries who desire to be re-
ceived into the arms of British “sassiety.” Wo-
men, already legal wives in England, and children
already legitimate in England, are, it seems, boy-
cotted for their concubinage and bastardy, and
Hogan appears to think that his new law, which
doesn’t enact anything new, will remedy this. The
absurdity of the real aims of the “ Colonial party ’
is sufficiently indicated by this measure, agreed to,
in pig-in-poke fashion, by the Australian Premiers.

guish the heartrending spectacle from 18 or 20
preceding ones.
The Sydney temperance demonstration the
other afternoon was a queer sight. Half-a-dozen
more or less seedy devil-dodgers, a few black-
dressed, winter-faced women, and some vacant-
looking prigs were the leaders. The balance was
composed of children mostly under the age of 14,
all certainly too young to know what they were
doing. One of the features was a man on a trolly
with a face painted a most inartistic red, who cer-
tainly comported himself as no respectable drunk
would think of doing.

A Victorian native recently died in Sydney,
leaving directions and cash for shipping his body
to Melb. for burial. When the mate, in tallying,
called from his manifest, “One coffin and corpse,”
the crew struck, and the consignment had to be
shoved back on the Quay before they would resume
work. Later in the day a packing-case was taken
on, and the mate yelled “One specimen natural
history in case. ” A ghost now cackles at mid-
night in Melb. general cemetery as it tells the yarn
to other shrieking spectres.

that Gov. Brassey’s wife, at said meeting, while
badgering Inspector Curlewis as to the amount
and quality of the needlework in State schools,
opined that singing and drawing might well be
curtailed in favor of needlework, considering the
“station in life” of the scholars. A plucky
woman present told her Excellency that ‘ that is

“RUBBING IT IN.”
An ingenious Adelaide woman has written
the Yic. Government, offering to journey to Mel-
bourne, and cure the sweating evil in two years, on
a pretty little principle of her own. She proposes
to conduct a crusade amongst factory-girls, with a
view to converting them into seraphic servants,
cooks, nursegirls, and kitchon-rouseabouts. All
she asks is that mistresses will aid her by making
the life of the hired girl a dream of happiness— by
putting on two shifts of servants, instead of work-
ing one poor, bedraggled slavey all the way round
the clock, and by allowing them to feed in the
'lining-room, and, it is to be presumed, to be
nursed, each by her pet-particular policeman, in
the drawing-room, and by giving them the use of
the piano and a latch-key. The would-be crusader
concludes with the assurance that her husband
“ would have no objection to her being away from
him for a year or two,” by which time she expects
to have made cheap and cheerful domestics of the
sweater’s victims. It is a bright idea, and, for its
accomplishment, only needs the conversion of the
average girl and the average mistress. The Bul-
letin would prefer to convert the average sweater
—it would be a smaller contract.

The N.S.W. farmer, in some districts, is
practically “chucking it up.” The Bulletin
knows one locality, within 70 miles of Sydney,
where the sole source of revenue for a very large
proportion of the farmers now
is road-mending. In the wild
and general desire to go road-
mending contract prices have
been cut down until the menders
have given up hoping for any-
thing for themselves, and only
expect to get enough out of the
work to buy horse-feed until the
grass grows again. Recently a
contract which occupied two
men and two horses for five
weeks was taken for £3 —six
shillings a week for each horse,
and the men thrown in. There
is a fixed annual grant for the
maintenance of that road, and it
goes so far now that the road is
better kept than it ever was
before —in fact, it is almost the
only local asset. The road-
mending population is doing no
agricultural work, for it takes it
and the horse all their time to
earn enough to keep the horse
alive. The rest of the population
is either away looking for road-
mending to do, or else arguing
with the storekeeper about a bag
of flour on credit. The only
solvent man in the parish is one who wisely lets
his selection rip and acts as gardener for a capitalist
six miles away. He is only home on Sundays, so
on the other days his wife goes forth and beats
out the chronic bush-fire single-handed, and per-
suades the horse (24 years old) to come out of the
waterhole ; and rescues the baby in between times
when it has gone into the bush to look for snakes,
or has sat down on an ant-bed.

“I am an anchorite, and the world is mv

This may be an explanation of Dr. Fiaschi’s
departure: In Sydney there are two Italian
factions, one ultra-Conservative, the other ultra-
Demooratic, between whom there has long been a
deadly feud. The doctor was amongst the
former. Ihe Conservatives, on hearing of the
defeat of the Italians in Abyssinia, held a meet-
ing, and passed a resolution that “the national
honor should be vindicated ” by continuing the
tight. Ihe ultra-Democrats met, and while pass-
ing a motion condemnatory of the war, seized the
occasion to scoff at the patriots, and to sneer
at their violent desire to send other men to
continue the fighting, while they urged them on
from a safe distance. Fiaschi was always a sensi-
tive man—good surgeons, it is said, generally are—
and the gibes of his old-time foes goaded him to
vindicate himself from their aspersions in the only
possible way. So away he goes to the war, while
many of those here whose sufferings he alleviated
—among others, the writer of this— send a little
prayer that so brave and skilful a man may not be
a victim to Quixotic ardor.

“ Djin-Djin ” opened in a burst of glory
at the Lyceum on Saturday, and asserted itself as
the most dazzlesome pantomime yet seen in
Sydney. This much may be said without fear of
contradiction, except from evil-disposed persons.
The money spent on more than one single scene
would have kept the staff of any ordinary paper
unsober for three weeks, and the Firm gets good
value for its expenditure, too. In some places it
has got the local coloring in strong, and a pleasant
flavor of Japan is wafted across the footlights ; at
other times it isn’t, but whether the scenery is
appropriate, or whether it is merely heaved in re-
gardless of time or place or circumstance, it is all
gorgeous. The earthquake is the most complete
thing that space could allow of. The big stage is
choke-full of old Japanese city just before the
catastrophe, and then the catastrophe comes along
with a great heave, and the city is left piled
several feet high on the stage. The earthquake,
in short, wrecks everything in sight, and no con-
vulsion could do more than that. The frozen forest,
and the Hall of the Thousand Storks, and the
Golden City, and the electric effects, and all the
rest of the magnificence, must be taken as read.
And with it all, if any one went away by himself
and read the book of the play in cold blood, he
would discover that “ Djin-Djin ” is a very ordi-
nary panto., with as little plot and literary merit
as the average ; there is one square inch of origi-
nal literature set in one square mile of expensive
frame and variety show. Pantomime in general
is spectacular drama gone out of its mind, only
“Djin Djin’’has gone out of its mind more ex-
pensively than the average.
* * * *
As regards the characters in the outbreak
proper/Florence Young is a fine, upstanding
sailor youth, and looks quite real in that male
garment which is best not mentioned. Flo. Graup-
ner is a good Jap. maid, and little Ivy Scott, if
possible, a still better one ; and Elton is reminis-
cent of the Insect and many other things. Also,
Edward Farley lifts up his splendid bass voice in
cavernous places as the Bogie Man, and a lot
of other capable people at large salaried come
and go without having time to leave a
decent-sized footprint on the show. Among
the people who rage on the outskirts of the
production, yet hardly belong to it, Coleman
is distinctly the best. As the usual objectionable
man in woman’s clothes he doesn’t amount to much,
but when he lets himself loose in his own proper
person he is a wildly hilarious scarecrow, and
makes more fun out of less material than any other
man in the show. This paper also desires to say
something fatherly and benevolent about several
of the crowd of child actresses, notably Carrie
Moore, Ida Ingersoll, and Isabel Hendley, who
may all consider themselves patted on the head
accordingly. Coleman, in his capacity as the
above-mentioned female, may consider himself
pounded on the head, which is a wholly different
thing.
** * *
Sydney Royal, Criterion, Her Majesty’s,
and the luckless Music Hall are all closed at time
of writing, but a great and general re-opening is
announced for Saturday. On that memorable
evening Bland Holt puts up his Highland-kilt
drama, “One of the Best,” at the Royal, and a
number of well-known people, whose faces are
sufficiently familiar, but whose knees the public
is not acquainted with, will exhibit these parts of
their anatomy for a change. The Bulletin’s
regret that Miss Elizabeth Watson doesn’t also
appear in kilts remains unabated, and it anxiously
suggests that perhaps some arrangement could be
made. On the same night, “ Called to Arms ”is
to blaze forth at Her Majesty’s. During last week
certain violent legal proceedings have been going
on, Bland Holt seeking to get an injunction, or
something, against the firm at H.M.’s on a ques-
tion of copyright, and it is understood that, if
things go wrong with the latter, they will fire the
Maxim gun intended for use in the battle-scene
promiscuously into the Full Court. Brough and
Boucicault also open their farewell season at the
Cri. on Saturday, with two nights of the “Pick-
pocket,” one of “ Rebellious Susan,” one of
“Dandy Dick,” and two of “Mrs. Tanqueray,”
to begin with. Then on Saturday (April 11), it is
proposed to stage “ The Importance of Being
Earnest,” written by a gentleman who is now
under a cloud and living on a light diet.
** * *
By way of further celebrating the hot-
cross-bun season, Harry Rickards and Alice
Leamar re-appear at Sydney Tivoli on Saturday,
and some other new people will be turned on at
the meter. At the Opera House “Trill-Bee,” a
burlesque on the heroine with the much-drivelled-
about feet, is to be staged, with Charles Cogill as
Svengali. Also, the Music Hall proposes to resume
its fitful existence, this time as a variety show.
In its dramatic capacity it died after a brief
struggle with “ East Lynne,” and thereby left a
great void. During its brief career it cast a com-
pletely new light on two dramas, and if fortune
had been more favorable it might have succeeded
in making “ Hamlet ” look so like “ Robbery
Under Arms,” and both of them so much like a
bush dog-fight, that no one would have known the
difference. The Music Hall, in this paper’s
opinion, should have been better supported.
** * #
Boucicault makes his valedictory Mel-
bourne appearance this evening (Thursday) dis-
guised in an Eton jacket. “ The Magistrate ” has
been selected for the farewell of the B. and B.
company, in order that a regretful audience may
be laughed out of any foolish determination to
drop a silent tear.
* * * »
Boucicault’s benefit speech at Melb. Prin-
cess’s last Saturday was disappointing. The actor,
who was obviously striving to make it appear im-
Eromptu, put no warmth into his words. Also,
is sidelong glance at Chief Justice Madden and
party, in the managerial box, when he attributed
the vast dimensions of his enthusiastic recep-
tion to the “ sympathy and loving kind-
ness of many personal friends,” was rather
distasteful to the stalls and amphitheatre.
Sympathy and loving kindness have very
little to do with the success of Saturday
night benefit performances. A popular bill, “ The
Amazons,” was offered to the public on this occa-
sion, and the public rolled up more freely than
they would have come under ordinary circum-
stances, mainly for the sake of hearing themselves
cheer more than usual in honor of a popular artist
and manager who was appearing for the last time
in his most humorous character. This was to be
a memorable occasion, with a speech added to the
programme. Therefore it appealed to the large
number of playgoers who like to be present when
something special is happening. Sympathy and
loving kindness, forsooth ! Boucicault and partner
Brough, when burnt out of the Bijou some
years ago, tried to repair the effects of their serious
calamity by resuming business immediately at the
Hibernian Hall. The new premises—out-of-the-
way and unsuitable for stage shows —put personal
friendship to a fair test, and found it quite
unequal to the strain.

On Easter Saturday Hie Firm’s new com-
pany from ’Murka, supplemented by evergreen
Harwood and a few other local recruits, will intro-
duce “ Trilby ”at the Princess’s. Everybody
seems to have either read Du Maurier’s hovel or
heard about its heroine’s feet, and the rush for
tickets is an assurance that “ Trilby ’’ will boom.

Melbourne Royal, after being submitted
to a scrubbing-out, will resume business on Satur-
day under C. B. Westmacott’s management. The
opening piece is “ The Enemy’s Camp,” and the
same people who lately earned a large amount of
respect for this gaudy spectacle at Sydney Royal
will give it another chance on the larger stage.
* * * * **
At the Opera House the course of true
variety business runs smooth. Charles Godfrey,
just now, chants praises to the Seventh Royal
Fusileers, and gets through three or four other
songs in particularly good style. Changes in
the second rank of the company are coming at
Easter.
** * *
Dan Barry’s cannibal feast is such an awful
attraction at Melbourne Alexandra that the
announcement of another lively horror for Satur-
day next seems uncalled-for. The gallery-boys
would gladly have listened to the drip, drip, drip
of blood from the Moocher’s heart until further
notice. Dora Mostyn imploring Gabbett to
appease his appetite with the stale fragments of
Moooher before starting to chop her (Dora) into
nice fresh joints, is a greater favorite than ever.
Herscreams, when Gabbett fondles his gory axe and
devours her lungs with his great goggle eyes, are
delightfully impressive. “The Sad and Solemn
Spectacle of a Quadruple Execution,” likewise a
“desperate sword combat between female con-
victs,” add to the well-deserved popularity of
“His Natural Life,” and, for these and other
reasons too numerous to specify, The Bulletin
recommends the Alexandra management not to
close Gabbett’s butchery establishment until after
Lent.

The fact that Brough is now taking music-lessons from
Benno Scherek, and is polishing up his vocal notes, points
strongly in the direction of his return to comic opera. In
the event of the B. and B. Co. dissolving, Titheradge, it is
thought, might retire awhile to his flower-garden at
Moonee Ponds. A dozen years’ mumming at a big salary
has enabled the steady Tith. to put by a few shekels. But
he should still have a long stage-career ahead. Look at
all the “ old ” parts he has to play !
The doll-like Ethel Haydon and her dog “ Smudgy ” fill
a page and a-half of a recent To-day with a drivelling
interview. The fair Ethel denounces “bikes” as un-
womanly ; and spiteful Melb. women will smile when they
remember the contour of the young lady’s legs as they
once appeared in Princess pantomime tights.
Mr. VV. T. Best, the organist, is reported to be hopelessly
ill at Liverpool, Eng. Mr. Best made many friends in
Australia, and was the only distinguished visitor to this
country who ever had the pluck (or acumen) to order two
whiskies-and-soda at once. The blackest aspect of Aus-
tralia, the eminent organist always said, was the slowness
of the hotel waiters.
Ada Crossle.v, writing on Jan. 30, already had 60

The Argus critic charges Brough (in his character of
the farcical insurance-agent in “ Niobe ”) with “ playing
to the gallery more sedulously than is permissible even in
so farcical a production as ‘Niobe.’” If the “gallery”
that attends a 8.-B. performance were the brainless
groundlings that the pawky one suggests, Brough and his
friends would have an excuse, almost a duty, to please
them —for it is the “ gallery ” that has given this splendid
band of comedians the only* consistent support they have
received in Melbourne. But the “gallery” is not the in-
ferior part of the audience —the “ gallery ” is cosmopolitan
and Bohemian, and throngs to all kinds of clever produc-
tions-the stalls and circle are only rei ' l , l V r "
thusiasm by leg-shows and operatic tnviahties. T h e time
is past when literal “ playing to the galleiy
garded as an offence. It is the gal ery that is thefinaland
just arbiter for the stage. The tact that Brou„I v D
the gallery in “ Niobe ” is a facer to the cntio.
Saturday Review on the gymnastic Hamburg's piano-
thumping His playing reveals a crowd of ju nblwl

sumes its dominion, and, to your great bewilderme ,
slaughters phrase on phrase, passage on passage, ‘ n ““

Melba’s terms for a recent concert-tour are said to ave

Phil Langdale, the bassoonist, is doing well again in
England, at Crystal Palace concerts and elsewhere, tne
absurdity of an expert specialist like Langdale staying

Melbourne Punch publishes a head-and-shoulders photo,

A stirring melodrama was recently played, the leading

The first gift in the distribution which wound up the

The “ Trilby ” madness has reached Melbourne. “ Her

The late General Ponsonby was very polite, and on

Once, the proprietor of a troupe of performing geese was
commanded to Court for the entertainment of Her
Majesty’s grandchildren. Next day, the impresario
received the following message “ Her Majesty would be
delighted to know if the members of your troupe are well,

Tommy Hudson,,who is closing his season in India prior
to returning to Australia, has beaten all past records this
trip. Mrs. Hudson goes to England in July, and Tommy,
for about the tenth time, threatens to retire. The Her-
mans have gone too; Harry Shine and the Bovis Bros,
follow.
Adelaide is promised a season of comic opera at Easter,
to be followed by “ Djin-Djin.” The announcement
nearly killed half the population. It is firmly believed
that the comic opera co. will turn out to be a troupe of
performing bears, after all.
Apropos the Watkins v. Marjoribanks breach of promise
of marriage, thus an English writer : “So far as one
knows, not a single marriage of the sort, except Lord
Orkney’s, has turned out satisfactorily. The Gaiety girl of
to-day is far from being (as ’twas customary to depict her
10 years ago) the victim of the aristocracy. She knows
the commercial value of virtue, and is as carefully
chaperoned as the well-shepherded Belgravian damsel.
She may call men by their Christian names, and she will
take all the jewellery she can ; but compromise herself,
never. The compromising is all on the masculine side.”
Decima Moore was on 20th Feb. married to the lengthy
Cecil Hope at Holy Trinity Church, Sloane-street, London.
Australia is woefully weak in actresses capable of doing
anything considerable with a big part, such as Fedora.
Mrs. Brough can, perhaps, play it rather more effectively
than Maud Williamson, whose throat complaint handicaps
her. And after Miss Williamson ?
Rumoured that “ Bob ” Brough will follow partner
Boucicault to England in about a year’s time. If true,
there is a poor look-out for serious drama and comedy in
Australia.
What a year of ’Murkan accent this will be in Austra-
lian theatres. Think of it: (1) “Trilby,” all ’Murkan;
(2) Potter-Bellew, half ’Murkan; (3) Hoyt’s “ Trip-to-
Chinatown” Co., all ’Murkan ; (4) Nat. Goodwin’s Co., all
’Murkan.
“ As You Like It” is to be the Potter-Bellew opening
piece at Sydney Lyceum. The pair will bring one or two
’Murkan players for leading parts, and the rest of the co.
will be drawn from local sources.
Veteran Harwood and Cyril Keightley are the only
local mummers who will figure in “ the firm’s ” “ Trilby.”
Harwood plays the serio-comedy part of the Rev. Thomas
Bagot. Phil. Goatcher has finished the scenery.
Out of the 100 plays produced in the ten vears of the
B. & B. partnership, Boucicault places the tollowing in
the order of the greatest pay-box successes “ Niobe ”
“ The Amazons,” “ The Second Mrs. Tanqueray,” “Dr
Bill,” “Caste,” “Dandy Dick,” and “The Village Priest.”
He regards “ Caste as the best all-round performance of
the co., “ Mrs. Ebbsmith ” as the best literary production
“ Diplomacy ” as the best acting play, and “ Mrs. Tan-
qimray” and “Fedora” as producing the finest individual
parts.
Mark Twain’s Indian tour, which R. S. Smythe intended
should last only five weeks, was prolonged because
Clemens, for the sake of his book, wanted to see the prin-
cipal historic cities, and because it was thought that the
Transvaal troubles might interfere with the South African
tour. The leading residents of Johannesburg are in "-aol •
and the Boers, who are not a humorous race mb-ht refuse
to allow them out even to hear Mark Twain. °
SPOUTING NOTIONS.
Lord Sheffield is a curious, not to say eccentrio
character. During several years he shut up his beautiful
cricket-ground in Sussex because after the matches the
lads and lasses evinced a fondness for sundry quiet nook*
wherein to while away the hours of gloaming—a thing
which the “ bachelor earl ” could not tolerate. Now he is
offended with good-natured Stoddart because Stoddy,
instead of writing thanks to his lordship for an invitation
to meet the Rest of England at Sheffield Park, was con-
tent with a cabled reply. To further mark his disap-
proval, the earl will, it is said, not have any of Stoddart’3
team in the eleven against whom the Australians are to
open their campaign.

Turner, during his first English season (1888), took 314

George Giffen’s sciatica is by no means to be
laughed over. He was warned about it months ago by an
Adelaide doctor, and underwent a course of massage
at the beginning of the season. He was' lately advised

presence in the Australian team means “gate,” and the
advisability of his retirement was not even considered.

by boat and second by train everywhere—he should, by
this time, have a nice little capital wherewith to start
the saloon which it is his ambition to run on returning
to the States.

Two cyclists who married at Young the other
day spent the honeymoon on wheels. A veracious country
chronicler says that “ after making due allowance for
stoppages they reached Dubbo in good time.”

The forthcoming benefit to Megson and Lewis is
a liberal move by the N.S.W. Wheelmen’s League, and
should pan out well. The cyclists named, having secured
the needful, will go to England on a racing trip. Both
are first-class riders who, for long past, have not been
seen at their best. In England they will doubtless be
retained by some firm as a machine advt., which should
make their living sure ; and provided neither gentleman
falls over-seriously in love, or gets married a la Ziin., they
should bring home a fair bagful of English oats.

Wallace has not yet won a race at Rand wick.
Last year he was downed by both Bob Ray and Georgie.
* * * »
Thus “ Scrip ” :—Doncaster mile, the chief
handicap tussle at Randwick to-day (Saturday), should
furnish a pleasant guessing competition. At time of
writing things bear a somewhat mixed aspect owing to
absence of acceptances, but where so many well-backed
neddies are in evidence, it will probably prove a case of
“But it on, and let us pray.” A much-of-a-muc ne s
characterises the leading lights, but on past form mid
breeding the Hotchkiss horse, True Blue, appears to be as
good as any. Albicore, if started, may show a true run,
but weight should anchor unlucky Gourallie. On Spring
efforts, if Te Whiti is M‘Sweeney’s best, his 6.12 ought to
see him through. Vagabond is the usual late rumor, but
the only other animal likely to cause consternation is
Laura, who has cost Oxenham a lot of money lately.
Knocking the crowd down to a trio, the writer goes for
Te Whiti, True Blue and Laura.
The public have put their little bank on Wallace
for Sydney Cup, and he may strike Ikey Mo’s note-chest,
but, as the weight has only once previously been carried
home by a three-year-old, the colt is just as likely to
cause blighted hopes. The Harvester is said to be not
quite “ fit,” but The Trier is if he doesn’t shirk the end-
up. Carmody may have Glenloth-luck with Music, who
has a pull in the weights, but so has Chesterman. It
doesn t generally matter, though, what rogues have to
carry. All the same, Chesterman may run the better.
Ihe writer has no special fancy for Toreador, who is a
certain starter. So is Damien, but a guess can only be
made at the rest, though perhaps Laura may emulate
her dam, Cerise and Blue. She can stay well enough at
a l>. v ' ra te. Wallace, Laura, and The Trier, therefore, is an
off-hand selection early* in the week.
A. J.C. St. Leger looks a paper moral for Wal-
lace, whose jock, will have his eyes skinned against a
repetition of the Flemington Leger hanky-panky. If the
colt loses this race, people will begin to think he was born
on a Friday.
Coil’s alleged return to form may put a different
complexion on Newhaven’s A.J.C. Champagne Stakes
prospects. The pair are the champions of their respective
provinces, and if the much-discussed Huret is saddled the
go should swarm with interest.

MAD!
He glowers within a padded cell,
A gentle youth, and fair to see,
And yet, from what the warders tell,
How very mad the lad must be.
He is a cricketer of might—
How past belief the tale must seem—
Who doesn’t think he’d any right
To go ’Ome with the Austral team.

The S.A. general elections take place on
Saturday, April 25. Already 110 candidates are
definitely out for 54 seats. In ’93 the number who
went to the poll was 128.
Last session of M.L. Parliament a Bill

No Government can last in Victoria which
will not fight to the bitter end for the rejected
Shopsand Factories, Companies’, and Employers’

is prepared to do battle.
All the R.C. candidates at Q. elections

From London Daily Telegraph leader :
“ England is so united that she need not be in the
least disconcerted even though two hemispheres at
once menace the Queen of Civilisation, the Ran-
somer of the Slave, the Mother of Free Govern-
ments, and the Mistress of the Seas.” One lie,
one hypocrisy, one self-delusion, and one empty
boast.
The Liquor
Bill of the Reid
Government pro-
mises to be an
interesting go-as-
you-please. The
Premier has inti-
mated his desire
to give the Goth-
enburg system a
trial. “ I per-
sonally hope,”
said Jacob Gar-
rard, the other
day, “ that the
day is far distant
when the Gothen-
burg system is
law here.” And
Joe Cook wants
total prohibition,
and Jack Want
will, if he can,
bring about free-
trade ‘in drink
and allow the
pubs. to stay
open all night.
Then, again, in
the body of the
House the Local
Optionists, be-
lieving they can
work their theory
best in munici-
palities, will coal-
esce with the
Gothenburgers,
and both together
will be opposed alliance of publicans and pro-
hibitionists. The bulletin holds, as it has ever
held, that the one thing necessary in the public
welfare is to eliminate all private interest in the
grog-traffic and make drink a State monopoly.
“Looking into the future, he saw
Federated Australia .... her waist bound with

He gave this girdle to the State —
And doubtless did so properly ;
For if all folk were of his breed,
Then modesty, ’twill be agreed,
-Would be a State monopoly !

The Turner Government is understood to
be hunting up democratic candidates to run against
the eleven Tory obstructionists who retire from
Vic. Council next August. There has been no
outward blaze of fury and large red adjectives so
far, but the general impression is that the Turner-
Isaacs-Peacock combination means to make a
bitter struggle to eject eleven of the forty-eight
dreadful fossils when election-time arrives.
PREMIER REID DECLARES WAR AGAINST THE RABBITS.
THE WAR MAY END THUS WISE—
OR THUS.
Speaking at Wellington, John Haynes
“ defended the N.S.W. land-tax as the first signal
victory of the country over the metropolis, and as
the first achievement in the programme of decen-
tralisation. He condemned the income-tax, and
said that he meant to give Premier Reid no
quarter on the subject. It was as unjust a tax on
industry and enterprise as protection was, and no
true liberal could defend it.” A straw showing
the direction of the Foreign-trade wind.
Attorney - General Byrnes, when inter-
rupted in Oddfellows’ Hall, Brisbane, on night
preceding election: “I only wish that the man
ri?l nll ' rru S- 8 with the cry of ‘Kanakas’ had
naif the intelligence of some of the Kanakas I have
met. And yet North Brisbane rejected Byrnes.
Premier Nelson, addressing Murilla, ad-
-o®c' figures showed that in ’9l
400 odd Kanakas died in Queensland ; in all, 1700
died in five years—say, 350 a year on an average -
or so “employed.” This compared
with 11 per 1000 of whites ! “The sugar industry
is flourishing ! ”
“Working Man” writes “to his fellow
workers ” m Brisbane Courier saying that he was
on a plantation where the Kanakas refused to
a sieept less than =£l per week, and went on strike.
White men got the job at 15s. This, in “Work-
ing Man’s ” opinion, is a proof the Kanaka is no
menace to the white man !
The S.A. Anglican Church-party
is industriously whipping up woman
voters, in view of the poll to be taken
in April re religious teaching in State
schools and the question of capitation
grants to private denominationa
schools. The dissenting churche
strongly oppose, so that the presen
democratic system seems to be safe
for the present, anyhow.
Ex-rail way-chairman Speight’s
supporters are now wondering if, afte
all, the Argus advocacy of his claims
has improved his chances of reinstate-
ment. One day the railway men’s ido
is lifted by the Tory organ on to a high
pedestal, and then left severely alone
for a week or two. On the other hand,
the attacks of the AGEhave been con-
sistent and bitter, to the terror oi
friendly-disposed politicians. With
these facts and the Ministry’s openly-
avowed antagonism, Speight’s hopes
are now below zero.
Old James Service, M.L.C.,
alleges that if the Turner Govern-
ment’s Companies Bill (now residing
in the waste-paper basket) had been
in force in ’93 every director of the
reconstructed banks would have been
ruined. Considering that the bill
would merely have made those direc-
tors personally liable for false or mis-
leading statements issued by them,
this would indicate that they were a
very misleading crowd, to say nothing
worse. As matters stood, however, it
was the public that was ruined instead
of the directors, and a good part of
the public was ruined by old James’s
own bank while old James himself is
still peacefully afloat. Under these
circumstances it would have been a
good deal more decent if Mr. Service
had left the subject alone. The spec-
tacle of an aged senator barracking
for a system under which he has kept
up while many of the people who be-
lieved in him and his system were
ruined is hardly respectable.
Attorney-General Byrnes was sure that
the blessing of God was with his crowd at North
Brisbane election ; and Macdonald Paterson,
addressing his little coterie after the poll, said
“he knew they had been actuated by tne purest
of motives and aided by the help of God. ” Fancy
invoking the presidency of the Deity for a contest
between Bulcock and Yellow Pup ! After all,
your true religionist is the only real blasphemer.
The Bulletin suggests that there shouM
be published quarterly, in the N.S.W. Govern-
ment Gazette, a list showing the names of all
persons imprisoned for debt in the various gaols of
the province ; the amount each prisoner is in gaol
for, giving the actual debt and the law-costs separ-
ately ; how long he (or she) has been in on this
occasion, and, if possible, how long he (or she) has
been in on any previous occasions ; the full name
and address of the person who put him (or her) in
P™™ ; the number and ages of the prisoner’s
children; and any other interesting particulars.
1 hen the pious elder who gaols a man with seven
children dependent on him fora few weeks’ arrears
°f woukl full credit for his action, instead
hiding himself under a bushel, as at present.
Ihe list should be a great deal more interesting
reading than a lot of things that find their way
ito the Gaz:;. . .j.

The report of the Employers’ Union (Vie.)
significantly states: —
The Employers’ Liability Bill was introduced in the early
part of the late session of Parliament, and the Executive
at once took steps with kindred associations to prevent
the measure becoming law. . . The Bill did not reach
the second reading*.
Minister Sydney Smith, of N.S.W. Mines
and Agriculture, is busily contemplating the early
production of sonic half-dozen different pamphlets
on tobacco, silk, and other commodities which fall
within his strikingly heterogeneous command,
oome applicants for the writing-up of the works
sent in, as vouchers of their ability, selections from
their printed verses.
William Copley, the S.A. politician who
has gone over to the Ass, and now opposes pay-
ment of members, thus spoke in S.A. Assembly in
August, 1887:
I maintain that payment of members will sound the
death knell of monopoly and Conservatism in the Council
—(Which it has done.—Ed. B.). . . Payment of mem-
bers is the only means by which the principles of the
Constitution can receive full effect. . . Payment of
members will, by widening the area from which'members
could be chosen, very much improve the legislation of the
future. /
Thomas Joseph Byrnes, Attorney-General
of Kanakaland, defeated at North Brisbane, bas
received no encouragement to stand for his once-
safe constituency of Cairns, where they take off
their hats and address the Kanaka
as “Sir.” No Govt, supporter offers to retire in
Thomas .Joseph’s favor, and he has expressed a
vague desire to wrap his toga round himself and
retire from Assembly politics, but all the same he
has been nominated for Warwick (without his
knowledge, it seems), though Warwick is already
provided with a Ministerial candidate. To this
gentleman Byrnes has given a pretty plain hint
by saying that he couldn’t think of taking a seat
at the expense of another Ministerial supporter ;
but, so far, the gentleman is deaf. So that, at
time of writing, T.J.B. hovers round with his
toga half-on and half-off.
One thing which Sangster, M.L.A., seems
to have proved definitely is that the marine sur-
veyors of the Vic. Underwriters’ Association hold
their offices solely at the discretion of the ship-
owners whose vessels they have to report upon.
Which raises the question: how long will any
average crowd of shipowners keep a surveyor who
tells them with brutal frankness when their ships
are rotten and unfit to put to sea ? Of course no
shipowners would sack a man for telling the
plain, unvarnished truth, but one surveyor, who
alleges that he condemned the Alert and the Julia
Percy as unsafe vessels, was “l’emoved” shortly
after for want of tact and various other things
possibly quite unconnected with any beastly otit-
spokenness on his part. Meanwhile, some other
surveyor apparently passed these vessels. The
Alert went forth and foundered, while the Julia
Percy got through one gale by the millionth part
of a hair—measuring the hair round the thick part,
or stomach.

THEFT OF A WINDSOR UNIFORM.
The gilt and glamor—especially the gilt—
that hedges round a Court costume, caused
the annexation on Friday by soma person
unknown of Sir Henry Parkc-s's Windsor
uniform. It is supposed that the parcel
containing the uniform was stolen from a
buggy in Pitt-street. A gentleman was
taking the parcel to a tailor to be attended
to, and it is supposed to have been ab-
stracted from the buggy when he pulled
up for a few minutes to speak to a Wend
tn Pltt-street. The police on Saturday
found the coat at a second-hand dealer's,
who stated that ha had paid a very mode-
rate price for It. The remainder of the
uniform has not as yet been found.

It is the pnde of the miller and baker to
produce white flour and white bread ; it is the pride
of the J rame Food Co. to restore to the public in
a cheap and palatable form those important con-
stituents of the grain which, in the production of
white flour, are simply wasted and thrown away.
Ihe mnermost kernel of the grain contains the
white starchy matter, while the husk is rich in
albuminoids and phosphates, which may be less
sightly but are of the greatest nutritious value.
I hey are however, firmly embedded in the woody
fibre of the husk, so much so that the human
system is powerless to extract them or obtain any
benefit from them when introduced in the shape of
whole-meal bread, which may even do positive

Fire Caused by Phosphorus.
Mr and Mrs. Stodart, of Ardonachie Station,
lately had an unpleasant experience. They
were returning home from Hamilton, when
Mrs. Stodart noticed smoke rising from under
the seat of the buggy and found that a parcel
of phosphorus, intended for poisoning rabbits,
was on fire. She at once seized the parcel and
flung it out of the buggy, and on' examination
ound that she had done so just in time to
prevent serious injury to herself and husband,
as the clothing of both was considerably burned.
Stationholders should use “ TOXA ” for
poisoning rabbits, as it will not ignite and is
safe amongst stock.*

Had someone stolen Parkes’s Windsor
uniform years ago the old man might have had

Dr. H. H. MEYERS, the missing N.S.W. medico.
Fred. Piesse, M.L.A., the new W.A.
Railway Commissioner, began life as a telegraph-
operator. He operated to advantage in sandal-
wood and kangaroo-skins.
J. F. Hogan’s belated impressions of Aus
tralia (the book is two years behind its date) come
in for a severe slating in the Saturday Review.
Hogan gushes about the charms of Lady Parkes
the Second, as if she were still alive, ignoring the
existence of No. 3. Also, he is one election behind
in his history of N.S.W. politics.
THE TI IRD VARIETY.
WORKMAN : “ Cushion-tyred or neumaiic-tyred? ”
CYCLIST: “ D-tired! !”
Isidor Lissner, Q. Govt, candidate for
Cairns: —“l am a bad speaker, but a good
Lissner.” Strange how Jewish wit runs to puns.
Zox, Salomons, and all the rest of them.
A N.S. W. counsel once closed an address
to a jury with : “ Eor God’s sake, gentlemen, for
Christ’s sake, for my sake, acquit the prisoner ! ”
Since then he has been known as the third person
in the Trinity.
William Holden, of S.A. Register, who
is seriously ill, is the oldest working journalist in
Australia. He is over 80 years of age, and has
been a newspaper-man for o ver CO years.
Melb. County Court Judge Hamilton, to a
hesitating barrister who was pleading before him
last week : “Go on, man ! Don’t be shivering on
the brink, like the gentleman in the hymn-book.”
Amongst the aristocratic visitors to Cool-
gardie is Viscount Avonmore—whose father,
years ago, was defendant in Threlfall v. Yel-
verton, known in legal history as the “ Yelverton
case. ”
Three brothers, triplets, are working
together at Swift’s Creek, Vic. Their respective
Christian names are Livewell, Dowell and Diewell.
They are known locally as “ Li.” and “ Do.” and
“ Die.”
Had Speight curled-up after his last defeat
at law, David Syme intended to restore the reduc-
tion made in his employes’ salaries when the
famous action was in its first battle. A proper
kind of thanksgiving—had it come off.
Dr. Bland, who in 1818 was convicted of
libelling the Governor, fined £5O, and sentenced
to a year’s imprisonment, was the first person
whose remains were taken to the Necropolis from
the Sydney Redfern mortuary station.
Ex-Sheriff Ellis was the most interesting
identity at the Melb. opening of the Equitable
Life Ass. Society’s splendid offices. He occupied
a little shanty on the same site, corner of Collins
and Elizabeth streets, half-a-century ago.
Some London dailies, served by the same
agency, in printing the Agent-Generals’ con-
dolences on Prince Battenberg’s death, made the
N.S.W. representative “Sir Samuel Smith.” Of
course, Saul was ramping. Corrections appeared
next day.
A Glen Wills publicaness to Vic. Mines
Minister Foster : “It is alwuz a good thing fer
the district t’ have yersilf spachifyin’ up here,
Misther Foster.” Foster beamed, and pulled
down his vest. “It do make the min so thirsty,”
continued Mrs. Publichouse.
Clever Pariss Nesbit’s contention that he
is only an amiable critic of Premier Kingston is
burst-up by a recent speech of his, wherein he
talked of Kingston “ thinking he was bigger than
God Almighty, and sitting on us with that fat,
unwieldy carcase of his.” You never talk of “the
unwieldy carcase ” of your friend.
Perhaps that conception of quaint minds,
the “disappearance disease,” which is said to un-
create a man as suddenly as Adam was created,
has caught Dr. Herbert Henry Meyers, 36 years
old, sft. Din. high, dark hair and skin, dark
whiskers and moustache—as per portrait adjacent.
Dr. Meyers formerly practised at Carlton, Melb.,
later at Ulverstone, Tas„ and recently at Pilliga,
N.S.W. On 29th Feb. he wired to his wife in
Melb. that he was going to Sydney to buy some
furniture ; and on the 6th March he was seen in
Sydney. Since then he has vanished—some sus-
pect to America ; but his friends think this im-
possible. Anyone who should run across him is
asked to communicate at once with the N.S.W
police for the sake of his anxious wife and
Mrs. Trait, the more or less insane woman
arrested on a charge of murder at Ballarat the
other week, is supposed to have become madder
than usual through the City of Melbourne Bank
closure. A bundle of the bank’s notes was found
sewn ' n one °f her petticoats.
Mr. Colin M‘Kav Smith who invite
+ -v ,• , , ® con-
tnbutions towards the preliminary expenses of
establishing in Sydney an anti-Socialistic morning-
paper, to be called the Sydney Times, is the
gentleman who is acting as “relator” in the
attempt to abolish payment of members in
N.S.W. Mr. Smith is a sexagenarian who writes
vigorous and accurate English, and is in thorough
touch with Conservative modes of thought.
Anarchist Andrews seems to have struck a
snag in Victoria. He complains of the inadequate
support given to his 3d. venture, Reason. “We
cannot pay for food, rent, paper, ink, postage, &c.,
out of the sum of 30s. per issue, which was about
the return upon our first number from the sales.”
THE SMARTEST OF SYDNEY
AUCTIONEERS.
Zimmerman, on arrival at ’Frisco, ascribed
ais three defeats in Australia not to meeting
superior men, but to his weakened condition
owing to the trying weather ; also, to the bad
tracks. But it was matrimony which beat Zim-
merman in Australia. The parson, not Parsons.
Mr. G. P. Slade, once well-known in
Sydney as a solicitor, and of late years resident in
London, who died a few weeks ago, had long
suffered from blood-poisoning after influenza, and
had undergone several operations which so weak-
ened him that he succumbed. He had not been
able to leave Margate for nearly a year before he
died.
The member of the Vic. parliamentary
cricket-team who scored 46 out of the total of 82
put up the first innings against N.S. W., addressed
each of his fellow-players as “ Sir,” and, although
Vic. parliamentary free passes frank holders over
N.S.W. tram-lines, regularly bought and paid for
his tram-tickets—a thing no self-respecting M.P.
ever does.
Archbishop Carr, in his recently-published
book, “ The Church and the Bible,” quotes in
large type, against the Protestant controversialists,
the phrase, “ Throw plenty of mud and some of it
is sure to stick.” The Archbishop has possibly-
forgotten that the phrase was coined by Voltaire,
the heretic, and applied to the prelates of Dr.
Carr’s own church !
Twenty aboriginals in full war-paint were
schooled to receive Gov. Lamington on his arrival
in Queensland. The Governor should have been
landed on a secluded spot and received by nigs,
significantly grouped about a fire, over which was
suspended a pot just about large enough for a man
of His Excellency’s size.
Spagnoletti : “When you talk about the
most delicious estate in Victoria I consider it is
this one: The place which a doting husband
wreathed around his lovely wife, after which she
bolted with the groom. I suppose he had beauti-
ful legs, in the buckskin, while hubby’s were of
the Hopetoun order, which the tar described as a
purser’s shirt on a marlinspike. ”
Hon. Tom Loader was most touching in
the witness-box when lie referred to his wondrous
faith in the dead manager of the City of Melb.
Bank. “I must confess, though,” said the ex-
chairman, with a sigh of new-born sorrow, “ that
that confidence has been considerably shaken as
the result of this examination.” It must be ter-
rible to feel obliged to kick a corpse.
Financial or social notoriety attaches to
each of the Melbourne directors of the Equitable
Life. James Balfour, Reggy Bright, the white-
haired damsel-killer, and Arthur Blackwood
Rather a strange combination of B’s—Balfour’
Bright, Blackwood! The first-named, one imagines'
must make a point of opening board-meetings with
a long and earnest prayer for the other two.
The most comical spectacle of the annual
Vie. military encampments is that of the rotund
and hairy Rev. Dr. Bevan, who is an honorary
chaplain. He wears the regulation little cap
perched on the top of his wild shock of white
hair, looking like a round match-box on a heap of
straw; andhis24-gallon-ca.sk iigure is enveloped
in a tight-fitting military frock-coat, liberally
l'rogged.
Somers Vine, having exhausted his Aus-
tralian stories and the variants thereof, is no
longer so frequent a visitor at Marlborough House
(writes a Bulletin correspondent from London) —
in fact, it is said that he has been cold-shouldered
lately by Tummy. The financial failure of the
Imperial Institute is partly attributed to his
mismanagement, and this is a dire offence.
But to do Vine justice, one must say that
he is not the only one who lias helped to muddle
the business ; his chief, little brain-slicking Abel,
is much more responsible than the brusque Somers,
who, with all his faults, has some originality as a
showman.
Gov. Hampden at Sydney blind-asylum
meeting:—
I had the advantage of a close acquaintance for many
years with the late Mr. Henry Fawcett. One Christmas-
time, at Cambridge, as we were walking out together in
the morning, he pointed out to me a tree that faced the
colleges, and said, “Is not that a fine cedar?” I could
not help turning round to him on the moment and say-
ing, “ Well, it is a very fine tree, but how is it that you
know it is so ? ” He said, “ Yer forget that I could see as
well as you can when 1 was an under; raduate at Cam-
bridge.” He lost his sight when he was 10 or 20 years of
age, his eyes having been shot out. I have taken the case
of Mr. Fawcett as an illustration to show you what is
possible to human endurance, and human ability, and
human courage.
Lord Richard Neville’s cabin library on
the Sunbeam “chiefly consists,” it is related in
the press, “of depressing works of the type of
‘ The Family Physician,’ ‘ Modern and Domestic
Medicine,’ ‘ Haydn’s Dictionary of Popular Medi-
cine,’ and other ponderous ton.es, calculated to
‘ give a name ’ and a gruesome significance to
every ache, real and imaginary.” After which
printed announcement, as it pouts to hypochon-
dria, Lord Richard will have a bad time at the
hands of the quacks. By every post he will be
asked “Young man, don’t you feel well?” and
whether he is suffering from “ symptoms akin to
the above.”
One of the most successful meetings Vic.
Freetrade apostle Max Hirsch (“made in Ger-
many ”) ever experienced was at Caledonia, a
Scotch mining township in Lilydale district. The
shire president, hight M‘Taggart, or words to
that effect, was in the chair, and introduced Max
as “Mr. M‘Hirsch,” whereat the concave upper-
lips of the assemblage softened palpably. But
when Max’s oratory got into full swing and he
reeled off his statistics and his well-known de-
nunciations of the Age and the Protective policy
and the landlord, the freckle-bespangled visages
warmed to the subject, and every one of Max’s
telling points was cheered to the echo. It was
the greatest conversion the Vic. Freetraders ever
effected. As the meeting broke up, a long, red-
haired, raw-boned Aberdonian remarked to his
mate, “ Aye, but it was a graund lecture, a graund
lecture.” “It was that,” responded. the other;
but whaur hae thees M‘Hirsch come frae? I
dinna ken a Seoatish ahkseent like hees at
a’, at a’.” “Aweel,” explained Rufus, “ Ah’m
theenking he’s frae Shutland.”
Another story of C. H. James’s prowess
with his hands. During the occasion of a visit t*
Queensland, James was sleeping at the homestead
of a prominent member of the Pastoralists’ As-oci-
tion, and in the middle of the night was awak< : d
by a sound as of someone breaking into his room.
James forgot for the instant that he was not in
his own 1 oorak mansion, and at once diagnosing
burglars, hopped out of bed, threw open the door,
and ‘ dealt it out ” to a roughly-clad person stand-
ing in the passage. The supposed burglar feH
heavily to take his lOsec., and James had just
dropped on top to secure the malefactor when he
remembered “ where he were,” and striking a
match revealed the recumbent form of a fat
capitalist weltering in his gore. The Melb. man
sneaked silently back to bed and said nothing,
his host spent all next day in bed getting over
the effects of a dastardly outrage by shearers.”
The truth leaked out soon, however, the squatter
taking his punching good-humoredly enough, but
telegraphing to every station on James’s route—
Look out for C. H. James ; he has burglar on
the brain.”

Advertisements in Sydney dailies for lost
black-and-tan dogs, &c., make bushmen smile.
Ihe other day a dog followed a mob of 7000
travelling sheep out of a Darling Diver town.
His owner walked after them the next day. At a
cross-road m the outskirts of the town he inquired
which road the sheep had taken. “Sheep?”
asked a sleepy-looking young woman, “ I don’t
remember any sheep passing by here yesterday.”
• 1’ 7/t’ m °th e r, ” interrupted a barefooted little
girl I saw sheep yesterday.” “Aye,” said the
mother, as I come to think of it, I believe the
sheep did pass here ; but I didn’t notice what
roa,d they took. ” The road crossed right in front
of her house, and 7000 sheep raise enough dust to
smother Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide !
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

Did Diana, the last of the Tooram (Vic.)
aborigines, had before her death joined the Salva-
tion Army and turned teetotaller. This to please
the popular Miss Mary Murray, who was then
canvassing hard for brother Jack in his parlia-
mentary campaign against the Conservative W.
Allan. At this time Jimmy Lee, a well-known
Irish J.P., “pegged out,” and Warrnambool
Society formed a select party to visit Lee’s house
in the evening and see for itself what a
wake was like. When Society had arrived and
drawn long faces, Miss Murray asked Diana to
show the ladies what she had learnt at the Army.
Diana at once held forth something like this
Lord say it prayer por Hitter Mully,
And pray por Mitter Lee ;
And say it prayer por Mary Mully,
And say it one por me.
Make it get him Mr. Mully
Belongin’ to plenty vote ;
Don’t let Allen beat it, Lord,
Him big one (blanky) goat.
Then Society left.
In our adveitising columns will be found
the announcement of three of the largest trade
exhibitions and markets in the world, which are
annually held at the Royal Agricultural Hall,
London, England, under the auspices and direct
patronage of all the leading firms in the respective
trades. It will be seen that the “Confectioners
and Bakers’ Exhibition ” takes place from Septem-
ber 18th to 25th ; the “ Grocery, Pro vision, Oil and
Italian Warehouse Traders’ Exhibition ” from
October 2nd to 9th ; and the “ Brewers’, Malt-
sters’, Mineral Water Manufacturers, ’ &0., Exhi-
bition and Market ” from Oct. 31st to Nov. Oth.
It will be readily understood that these gatherings
form the most favorable markets for all who desire
to purchase to the best advantage, and it would
be well for colonial and foreign firms to instruct
their various European agents to visit these Exhi-
bitions in due course and place their orders accord-
ingly. The Agricultural Hall is the largest build-
ing of its kind in England, and the volume of
commercial transactions effected during the pro-
gress of these three important organisations is
always phenomenal.

serve the hair; therefore use Rowlands’ Macassar
Oil ; also in a golden color for fair-haired children
and ladies.
ROWLANDS’ ODONTO.
A pure, fragrant, non-gritty tooth powder; it
whitens the teeth, prevents and arrests decay,
strengthens the gums and sweetens the breath.
Ask Druggists and Stores for Rowlands’ articles,

avoid cheap poisonous imitations.
THE JOHN BULL TEA
Now on the Market is acknowledged
by experts as the Finest and Purest
Blend in Australia.
In view of the many cueap and
impure teas now being sold, the public
should demand the “ John Bull ” blends,
and not be put off by anyone telling
them. they can supply as good at the
same price.
Shopkeepers may not make so much
profit on this tea, but they have the
satisfaction of knowing they have given
the best value.

How’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
How’s Dander on Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for rem >v-
mg all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and mver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.
Port Adelaide, October 30, 18s(i.
Baron Bsrzilius’
Buchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS' REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, niorhid Inila-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dv spepsia, in Cnronio
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant ; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Med ical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. :—The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions < f Bile, and correcting it
when deianged, and restores healthy evacuations in cases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.-8888 I find tinge Hitlers a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening ; a stimula t to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend tin m.
G. B. WOOD, M.D. —lt is the purest of Bitlers, and
exerts q, peculiar influence over the liver.

Attention, Please!
ASTONISHING, isn’t it, that eighty out of every hundred manufacturers of Hair Restorers are
positively bald ! Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that we are fast becoming a bald-
headed people ! “ Physician, heal thyself ! ” could be most appropriately applied to these impostors
and charlatans. I can destroy all parasital growth as it affects the hair directly, but THESE parasites
I cannot remove. Their life or death is in your hands. Hitherto they have reaped a rich harvest at
your expense. The result is the premature loss of your hair. You can stop their little game by
refusing to buy their nostrums. If you suffered from any ailment of body you would not consult a
bricklayer or a carpenter. You would go direct to a doctor who had made it a life’s study. Why
should you continue to use preparations that are manufactured by people who do not possess even an
elementary knowledge of the “ Hair and its treatment ?
Send two stamps for my Illustrated Pamphlet on the “Hair and its Treatment.” To all who
desire a good head of hair, it is worth its weight in gold. Every person who wishes to escape pre-
mature baldness cannot do better than use my
Marvellous Hair Restorer.
Thousands of Testimonials to hand prove that it contains all the essential elements necessary to
produce and to keep healthy a good head of hair.

How to rear a child is one of the greatest
problems that affect humanity ; full half the child-
ren die before reaching the early age of five years.
The obvious reason is, either that the children
have nothing to live for, or else that, although
wishing to live, there is not the proper sustenance
handy for them to live on. The fresh and lovely
child whose photo, appears in this issue has
clearly a great deal to live for, and muchly enjoys
her meals. She is the embodiment of innocence,
health, and happiness ; she lives on Arnott’s Milk
Arrowroot Biscuits —her mother, wise woman,
always saw that she got Arnott’s. Messrs. Arnott
have innumerable photos of lovely children
who, having all been reared on the famous bis-
cuits, combine plumpness with a heavenly ex-
pression. The firm, judged from this trustworthy
evidence, has solved the whole problem of rearing
beauteous infants in this country. And, since the
race that fills the cradle rules the world, mothers
are advised to keep Arnott’s biscuits, so that the
cradle will always remain full—that is, won’t be
prematurely empty. One fact which mothers
should remember is that all the milk used in the
manufacture of Arnott’s biscuits comes from the
firm’s own dairy, which is supervised by experts—
a circumstance which deserves the highest com-
mendation. As time goes on the photos of many
children, certified to be reared on Arnott’s biscuits,
will appear in this paper; and their names and
addresses will also appear as a guarantee of good
faith.*
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
quyer of all other Australian gems.*

PRESS NOTICES OF “IN THE DAYS WHEN THE
WORLD WAS WIDE.”
“ How graphic he is, hiw natural, how true, how strong!
. . . Lawson’s keen sympathy, his knack of observa-
tion, are characteristically feminine. His sense of humor,
his talent for vivid portrayal, are as characteristically
masculine. Yet it is the woman in him, as in others,
that makes his talent glow to the white heat of genius.”—
The Bulletin.
“ The verses have natural vigor, the writer has a rough,
true faculty of characterisation, and the book is racy of
the soil from cover to cover. . . Space forbids anything
in the way of quotation, and we can do no more than call
attention to the breezy sweep of such lines as those in
‘ln the Days when the World was Wide,’ the pitiless
realism of ‘ Out Back,’ the quaint moralising in ‘ For’ard,’
the grim fatalism of ‘Taking his Chance,’ the reflective
insight in ‘ Faces in the Street,’ the ring of ‘ The Roaring
Days,’and the hopeless note of monotony in ‘The Great
Grey Plain.’ ” — Sydney Morning Herald.
“ This is emphatically a book to buy, to read, and to
re-read with ever-recurring pleasure.”— New Zealand
Mail.
“It is difficult to select stanzas from a set in which all
are superb.”— The Champion.
“ There is a touch of deeper feeling and significance in
Mr. Lawson’s compositions which should ensure them
cordial acceptance by thoughtful readers.”—The Cosmos
Magazine.
“ There is much in this book that the world will be the
better and the richer for. Theie are grand songs in it,
with a cheery swing, that are full of the odor of the gum-
bush, that are resonant with the sounds of Australian life.
There are stories full of love, pathos and beaut}', such as

Gaul us, winner of Hawkesbury Handicap and
Rosehill Cup, was always regarded as a hot pickle. Under
the circs., his stable was lucky in getting long odds both
times. His dam, Industry (a Musket), was a good jigirer
in her day.

Four Australian jockeys practically killed within

W. R. Wilson is one of the few owners who like
chestnuts. Wallace is the best he ever bred. The St.
Alban's color-prejudice extends only to greys.
* * * *
Wallace eased to fives for Sydney Cup in the
week, consequent on a run on Toreador, who wont from
tens to sevens. Patroness and Acmeiia were the best
backed of the weaker sex. Weight of money has made
Courallie the Doncaster favorite at time of writing, touch-
ing eights. Stable commissions favored Jack o’ Lantern,
True Blue and Inspiration same dav.

The Hova crowd is very reticent as to its
horso’s in ivements. Should he come to Sydney the Mile
All-Aged Stakes is a moral if he can, as alleged, break
1.40. If Adelaide is decided on, he ought to'sweep the
w.f.a. hoard there.

Norton failed to place himself in Liverpool
Grand National, but, according to an advice last mail,
may shape better in the Prince of Wales steeple, run at
Sandown Park this week.

Lizette’s Caulfield record jump, 37ft., has been
equalled by Hopeful (half-brother to Mon Ami) at Hamil-
ton (Vic.). Chandler (Eng.) made such another leap once
over a water-jump.
* * * *
The highest Australian jump made by a lady,
in saddle, is sft. 9in., put up by Mrs. Stace on the Brisbane
horse Anyhow, at Tenterfield show on March 11.
* * * *
Certain it is that the bigger the owner the more
necessity for sweep-horse holders to lay a “ hit to no-
thing.” Perhaps it is that they can better afford to
“ bite their nose off to spite their face.”
* * * *
Strange that Mr. Figg’s two trotters, Tuxedo
and Lady Era, should each have the playful habit of
throwing the driver out of the sulky. Tuxedo came with
that reputation from England. Could the Lady have
learned the trick from him ?
* * * *
The steeplechasers entered for the A.J.C. meet-
ing are a very ragged lot, and there doesn’t seem much
prospect of N.S.W. neddies shining in the winter inter-
provincial contests. The only new name is Fishmonger,
a sturdy M.L. lepper, who has a better record than any,
bar Waterbury.
* * * *
Outside each of the “ closed ” Sydney tote-shops
you may still see a solitary figure with a bunch of tickets
m one hand and a pencil in the other. If you happen to
be a tall, hairy person with large flat feet, your application
for a half-crown ticket.will be met with a vacant stare;
but if you are an undersized, clean-shaved person with a
soft feit hat and bow legs, you may back your fancy to
your heart’s content.
* * ♦ *
People have a notion that it is impossible to live
by backing horses. How is it then that at every Sydney
race-meeting—and, counting the night meetings at' Lillie
Bridge, there are eight every week —you may see the
same faces from one year’s end to the other? They are
not bookmakers; they are mere punters. These people
must live, and do live, and, judging from appearances,
live well. Now, how do they do it ?
* » * *
A certain Q. bookie got a surprise the other day.
When double-laying he bawled into a passing owner’s ear,
“ This and the next!” getting a bang on the nose in
reply. “ What’s that for ?” he enquired furiously. “That’s
for ‘this,’ and this” (hitting again) “is for the next
blanky time you try to stiffen my jockey with a fiver.”
* * * *
The tote often can’t register the crowd that
compete in hack events on the West Coast of northern
M.L., so horses are bracketed together. If one so
bracketed wins, and the other runs last, the latter pays a
div. just the same. Backing a losing winner is new in its
way.
* * * *
Apropos of forestalling. When big books were
the vogue in M.L. two smarties with some ready money
rushed a certain horse for a handicap, got a few thousands
and made him favorite. The owner, being well-nigh
“broke,” had to start the neddy, which won. Not a
oopper was laid him by the clever pair. That owner,
however, now relates, apparently with grim satisfaction,
how one of the two died in M. L. through drink, while his
mate perished on a parched and thirsty Australian plain
for the want of it.
* * * *
How is it that Ikey Mo has not yet obtained a
footing on bowling-greens to wager on the singles, pairs,
handicaps, whisky pools and all the rest of it ?
» * * *
M.L. gambling-law. A welshed punter com-
plained of the disappearance of a mushroom-bookie, who
had laid him tote-odds. X 4110 told the victim to hold
his tongue : he had made himself liable to a £2O fine for
accepting tote-odds from anyone but the machine itself.
* * * *
Someone finds that there is a law of George 111.
which prohibits pony-racing, and this has not been
repealed in N.S. Wales. It may be used against the Ken-
sington and other clubs, but public opinion will not
support such tactics.
* * * *
A crowd of Adelaide “books” were recently
heavily fined for wagering in the streets, without even
.jailing the odds. As the courts now construe the Totali-
sator Act, any betting except through the machine is
absolutely illegal. In fact, if Moses Cohenstein merely
whispers through his nose to Ikey Goldsmidt that “ it’s
two to one it’ll rain to-morrow ” the police instantly hang
on to his collar and have him fined £5. Very soon an
Adelaide “ bookie ” will only be valuable as a specimen
for the museum.
* * * *
Griffo, the miniature Tom Sayers, must now be
very nearly at the end of his tether. He was not long
since run in for drunkenness in Yankeeland, and his
friends had to raise the 2dol. fine. Dissipation and im-
pending legal proceedings compelled him to refuse an
offer of £BOO to appear at the big Mexico boxing carnival,
from all which comfort may be derived with the thought
that each outbreak makes a return to his native city less
likely.
* * * *
The way Jim Hall played with Choynski while
his condition lasted shows what a pugilistic career the
long Australian threw away by a life of riotous living.
Hall was the coolest local boxer the writer ever saw-
reminding one much of Jem Mace in his palmy days,
never doing an ounce of superfluous work with head,
hand; or foot, always just out of distance for his adver-
sary’s blow, but timing his own to a nicety. And Hall
resembles Mace also in the possession of a remarkably
weak spot. As a stripling, the writer saw Hall lie down
before a man he was able to thrash out of hand, and from
that day could never stand the long fellow as a world-
beater.

There are some big Melb. football meetings in
May. Melbourne v. Essendon, on the 2nd, opens the
season ; Fitzroy (last year’s premiers) v. Essendon, on the
16th ; Fitzroy v. Melbourne, on the 25th (for Queen’s birth-
day). June 6th is set apart as a day for oharity matches
—a new departure.
* * * *
Though talked of last year, Sydney Rugby
Union has made no sign re adopting electorate football.
This hugger-mugger policy Is losing the Union much-
needed dollars. Were electorate the vogue, public inter-
est in strongly-contested amalgamated locality matches
would be trebled ; receipts accordingly. The scheme is
perfectly workable, and players would fall into line at
once. But the Union appears chary about leaving the old-
fashioned track. Under the new idea, too, clubs, enjoying
a much stronger membership, would be "able to acquire
professional teachers and proper appliances requisite for
an all-round athletic training, and scientific field exhibi-
tions would result. Also, young members would enjoy
all advantages, and secure promotion if merited. At
present, unless a rising player has committee-inliuence,
the first 15 is beyond his ken.
The amalgamation of the Balmain f.c’s will
enable that locality to be very strongly represented this
season. It is officially stated, too, that the Wentworth's
have “arranged ” to import three dandies from Maoriland.
Which is unique in the way of commercial enterprise,
though rough on local talent. There will be a few notice-
able eliminations from the Pirates, but plenty of good
material is obtainable North Shorewards. Other clubs are
also procuring the best kicking tackle available.
Sydney f. clubs aren’t noted for their “cash pro-
fessionalism.” Three last-season players used to receive
2s. each for a Saturday-night razzle —if their side won,
which wasn’t oiten. Otherwise, they merely got mono-
tonous street-corner sympathy.
* * * *
For the first time since its formation, Melb.
Mercantile R.C. succeeded in winning a senior eight-oar
contest, when on Saturday last the Vic. championship fell
to its crew. The race was a very open one, the Mercs.,
Yarra, Albert Park, and Tamar (Tas.) eig'hts being, as far
as practice was concerned, practically equal; and so little
money changed hands. The winners were stroked by A.
B. Sloan, the brilliant Fitzroy footballer ; and R. E.
Dawson, the “ cash amateur ” cyclist, rowed No. 3. Four
of the remaining six were junior and maiden oarsmen,
but they all pulled like a crew of years’ experience, and
won by a length and a-half, alter a two-mile tussle with
the Yarra, in 17min. 27sec. But the so-called champion-
ship is an empty honor, for the Wendouree R.O. (Ballarat)
could donkey-lick the winners.
* * * *
Tom Kelly, trainer of Beach and others, docs
not understand the statement that he was to go to
England with Stanbury. He never had any such
intention, and is strongly of opinion that Jim will
be beaten, owing to his tendency to make flesh
even here. Pearce and Kemp both lost in England to
men they “could carry and win from” here, by reason of
adiposity, and Kelly thinks Stanbury the hardest man to
train we have had. Jim’s day’s “ work ” has always been
phenomenal in its severity, and yet he had great trouble to
keep the flesh in abeyance. Veteran Kelly says that the
best man he ever did see was Donald M’Donald, of
Grafton, who, allowing for the fact that he only scaled
lOst. 41b., was, Kelly thinks, the fastest and certainly
the prettiest sculler ever known anywhere.

The trade gag “ that anybody without a bicycle
is nobody ” doesn’t quite fit the case ; “ anybody on a
bicycle is nobody” is the correct expression. Anyone
who doesn’t think so should watch the butcher-boy pass-
ing Gov. Hampden in the Centennial Park.

The whirligig of (the) time—the bicycle.

A Melb. biker the other day, in a three-and-a-
half-mile run on St. Kilda road, passed the Guvmenthouse
crowd (five), three doctors, four lawyers, four M. L.A’s,
six society ladies, a butcher in his blues, a lamplighter
with his pole, a carpenter with some joinery work on his
handles, and two Chinese —one of them a laundryman
taking home “welly ni’ iloned shirtee.” And the Chows
rode as well as any in the crowd.

COMPLETELY CURED HIM.
Mr. T. J. Clune, of Walkerville, Ade-

“Six years ago, I had an attack of
Indigestion and Liver Complaint
that lasted for weeks ; I was unahre
to do any hard work, had no appe-
tite, food distressed me, and I suf-
fered much from headache. My
skin was sallow and sleep did not
refresh me. I tried several reme-
dies and consulted a doctor, with-
out obtaining any relief; finally,
one of my customers recommended
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. It helped me
from the first, —in fact, after taking
six bottles I was completely cured,
and could eat anything and sleep
like a child.”

One of the most dismal courts ever held in
N.S.W. has been sitting at Broken Hill—the
Land Board Court, making new appraisements of
rabbit-smitten, drought-stricken, mortgage-laden
runs that, in any case, would have had a tough
struggle against the collapse in the market-values
of wool, sheep, &c. The witnesses have been
chiefly station-managers and representatives of
financial companies who have sought to show that
the rabbits converge on their own particular
station and stay there ; while, moreover, generally
speaking, wild dogs are worse on each man’s own
holding than anywhere else, and both rabbits and
dogs are particularly difficult to cope with just in
his neighborhood. Also, in nearly every case, the
country is a peculiarly bad one to water, because
of the tendency to silt ; one or two, according
to the reports, have added that duststorms fill
up the tanks and cause the fences to disappear
under drift. Every man of them says that all the
grass and most of the edible scrubs and bushes are
gone ; and every man of them is also assured that
the scrubs and bushes will never grow again.
There is scarcely one that cannot show that his
losses during the last few years have been either
greater than or about equal to his lambings ; and
most of them have observed that the fleeces and the
frames of the sheep are diminishing—through the
eating out of the country by rabbits, they say.
And some of them give actual figures in support
of their contention. On Mount Arrowsmith, for
instance, the average weight of scoured fleece in
18<J0 was 31b. 50z., ’9l 31b. 20z., ’92 31b. loz., ’93
31b., ’94 21b. 15g0z., and ’95 21b. 13|lb. Generally
speaking, the depreciation in the carrying capacity
of the West Darling country since the invasion of
rabbits —say in the last six or seven years— is de-
clared to be 50 per cent, or thereabouts (Crown
witnesses even admit that); while the fall in the
value of wool has been about 30 percent., and of
surplus sheep from 40 to 60 per cent. A hundred
and one other thingsjare also ascribed to the rabbit-
plague. Thus says one witness —“ The rabbits
have eaten out the grass roots, so that we get no
spring from an inch of rain like we used to do. It
takes over three inches now to do much good,
because the spring has to come from seed. ” And
another: “ The fleeces are getting dirtier and
dirtier. I attribute this to the eating out of the
scrubs. The dirtier the fleece the greater the loss
in carriage. The eating out of the scrubs and
grass-roots also increases the tendency of tanks to
silt.” Rabbit-net the country, of course, answers
the man who knows all about Eastern and Cen-
tral squattages. But men who have tried it on
this sand-drifty country, where the rains, when
they do come, are patchy and of tropical severity,
aver that the cost of maintenance reaches £5 per
mile per annum ; and yet this country will not in
its best state carry more than perhaps one sheep
to eight acres. On Gnalta, which was three years
ago wire-netted at a cost of about £5OOO, the
rabbits are almost as bad as they are outside, des-
pite continuous expense in poisoning and main-
tenance. Remembering that Ear Western fleeces
are light, the wool only of moderate character, and
the cost of carriage high, and that hundreds of
thousands of acres of country are unoccupied, this
“ net the paddocks ” solution of the problem will
be seen to have weak features about it.
A GRAND LITERARY INSTITUTION.
Cole’s Book Arcade now runs from the centre
of the block in Bourke-street to the centre of the
block in Collins-'street, Melb., a distance of 660 ft.,
and contains the following 17 departments, mostly
literary and artistic : 1, New Books ; 2, Second-
hand Books ; 3, Stationery ; 4, Music ; 5, Fancy
Goods ; 6, Toys ; 7, Perfumery; 8, Pictures ; 9,
Artists’ Materials ; 10, an Ornamental Exhibition ;
11, a Japanese Exhibition ; 12, a Wonderland ;
13, a Smiling Gallery ; 14, a Child’s Picture
Gallery ; 15, a Bargain Room ; 16, a Tea Room ;
17, a splendidly arranged new Wholesale Book
Department, containing half-a-million books. The
main walks of the establishment are half-a-mile
long. *
N.S.W. Railway * Commissioner Fehon’s
Corowa sheep-station, in the West Darling district,
is probably the best wild-dog run in Australasia.
The losses of sheep from the attacks of dogs are
estimated at 5 per cent, of the total flock per
annum. During the last five years 1452 of the
vermin have been killed and accounted for.
Messrs. D. Braham and Co. have removed
their cellular clothing depdt to much larger and
more convenient premises at 384 George-street,
Sydney, between King-street and the G.P.O.
The boom in cellular clothing had quite outgrown
the narrow limits of the firm’s old establishment,
but it is hoped that the new premises, which are
of great dimensions, and situate in the very centre
of the business part of the city, will accommodate
it for a long time to come.

—Yours very truly, B. BUTTON,

Mr. Button writes later:—“The Pills I had

In one case, when three hunters and trappers

the Rose River, one was taken very ill ; his mates
intended taking him in a waggon to Wangaratta
(about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor. I
gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to
inform you that having to pass their camp next

and looking well. This speaks volumes for your
valuable Remedies.”

It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform
you that your celebrated Alfaline Universal Pills

failed, of a stubborn case of Debility of 18 years’
standing. My wish is fulfilled at last, and I don’t
know how to thank you enough. Dear Sir, I

Skin and Blood Cured.
Canning: Mills, Canning, Western Australia.
To Herr Rassmussen,
lam pleased to inform you that your Alfaline
Lock Cure Pills completely cured me of a very
bad disease. Previous to taking your Lock Pills,
I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better; and I shall
never regret trying your Alfaline Pills, as they
had a wonderful effect on my complaint, which
several of my work-mates can testifv'to. I have
recommended your Alfaline Herbal "Remedies to
several of my friends, who have reason to be very
grateful for it, and I shall always do my best to
recommend them to any fellow sufferers. You
are authorised to publish this testimonial.
Yours gratefully, J. NERVIN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Hear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W, O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Eriday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did.

I am now eomplelely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your’

Johannesburg has got an unemp oyecl pro-
blem. Hundreds of men are seeking work of any
sort at Kafir wages.— Cape Argus.
Received, by a Melb. registry-keeper :
That cook you sent me last month was a fraud. She
came back from the township at one o’clock this morning
terribly tipsy and sinking like a maniac. When I asked
her to get up at 8 o’clock she said she would see me d d
nrst, and at dinner to-day, when I scolded her for burning
the custard, she threw it in the fire, and called me a
nagging old , and said all my brains were in my feet.
i wish you would be more careful in making your
selections.”
“I require an active man for hotel work. Duties —rise
at o a.m., clean boots, light fire for cook, and milk four
cows. After breakfast scrub out bar, passages, clean
windows and stables. After dinner chop wood and make
himself useful for the rest of the day. No work after
8 p.m. Wages, Bs. a week.”
“ I would like you to get me a respectable, educated
man used to farm work. He will have to milk 20 cows,
use scythe, split rails, and plough a little. I want him
also to teach my two boys (age 9 and 13) reading, writing,
and arithmetic at night; and as I am a widower I will
expect him to give a hand with the cooking. The wages
are 12s. a week. I would prefer a man that knows some-
thing about stump-grubbing.”
“ Will you kindly engage for me a married couple. Man
must be thoroughly competent to take charge of small
dairy farm ; wife to make butter, and look after pigs and
poultry. They will have to find their own bread, tea, &c.,
but can have milk, butter, and vegetables free. I expect
to get a reliable couple under these conditions for 17s. 6d.
a week.”
‘‘Will you please send me a respectable young man for
light work. He will have a comfortable home, and 12s. (id.
a wee k- He will be asked to wash the children and drive
them to school, and to assist in the kitchen, also to look
after two ponies, and keep things tidy.”
“ Will you please look me out a tutor for my three boys,
aged 10, 13, and 15 respectively. He must be a Protestant,
and will have to teach reading, writing, and book-keeping,
etc. He will live with us and not in the men's hut, but I
expect him to find his own blankets. Also, I expect him
to be civil and obliging, and to help with everything he
may be asked to. I can forgive most things but laziness,
that I can’t forgive. The last tutor I had was a new-chum
Englishman, a good teacher but the dirtiest blackguard
ever I met, and was so cunning that it took me a long
time to find him out, but when I did I kicked him off in
double-quick. So be sure and send me a respectable man.
Salary, £26 per year.”

Dear Bulletin, — The saw-mill industry
would form a training-school for Australia’s de-
fence-forces unequalled as a test of courage and
stoical endurance of wounds and abrasions. Gone
broke following a stringer on the diggings, I was
offered work at a local mill, to start next morning.
Surely the eye of man never saw a more battered
crew than those, my future mates. The hench-
man owned with honest pride that he had twice
been reported killed by timber flying off the saw —
once Maoriland way, and again in Echuca (Vic.)
His fingers, what there was of them, were hacked
about, and stuck out from the palm in every direc-
tion save that in which they had originally grown.
In recounting his various boxing-matches with the
circular, he always pointed out how lucky he was
not to have had more of himself sawn up. The
“ tailer-out ” didn’t have so many honorable scars
about his head, but the ends were off most of his
.fingers, and three were totally gone, ground to pieces
under the rack-bench. The hoppy gait of this
veteran was explained by the fact that all the toes
were gone from his right foot, also the big one on
the left. He explained it “ was lucky ” that his
foot was “ sort of turned,” or he would have had
no toes at all when the “ flitch ” fell off the “ skid.”
In the morning four of us mustered up ; one, a
new-chum, whom I had not previously seen, had
his head tied up in a blood-wet rag. He had been
getting out of the way of some other form of
sudden death, and had fallen into the sawdust
hole at the little bench. The saw had chawed a
bit out of his ear. The other two fellows thought
it “ was lucky ” that his head had not come fair
on to the saw, but the chum, being new to the
track, did not seem sufficiently thankful. He had
a “ Just before the battle, mother,” air about him
that was depressing. Gladiators saluting Caesar
is the only parallel to our ‘ ‘ good morning ! ” as
we filed past the boss. Saws had been running
about five minutes when a piece of timber 10ft.
long, 4in. x 2in., went like a spear over my head
and drove a hole through the iron roof. The new-
chum had allowed the scantling to touch the back
of the saw. As I put on my coat and left, I heard
the boss say “Some men don’t want work.”—

It, was at “old Paul’s” on the Murrum-
bidgee. Two bush youths, seated on a form in
the bar, were singing vociferously “Rule
Britannia,” when an old lag, half-seas over,
emerged from an inner recess. “What! Britons
never shall be slaves ! You dogs ! I’ve been
ploughing in Tasmania, yoked up like a
bullock, and you tell me Britons never shall be
slaves ! I’ll knock your heads together,
you —! ”
The New Guinea cigarette-holder, pipe or
“ bow-bow ” consists of a hollow bamboo from two
to three feet long, closed at one end and open at
the other. Near the closed end a small hole is
made in the bamboo, and in this a lighted cigarette
is inserted. From the open end the native takes
a long draught of smoke ; but, instead of blowing
it out, blows it back into the pipe ; hands the
calumet to his comrade, who then takes a whiff of
the already-used smoke through the hole in which
the cigarette was inserted. This operation is
repeated by the next pair of natives, and is con-
tinued in turn through the social circle—women
and children participating in the luxury. It is
only civilised man who is so unsociable as to want
a pipe all to himself.
Offenders sentenced to imprisonment under
14 days in Gidyatown do their time in the local
lock-up. The old lock-up keeper, Sergt. Mullarty,
is single and keeps no cook, and the prisoners get
three square meals a day from the opposite pub.
“Three Star Frank” came into the town with
a cheque, and wasn’t there long before he stood
before the magistrate charged with being drunk
and disorderly. “ ,£1 or 14 days.” Frank pre-
ferred to “ take it out.” He knew what sort of a
boarding-house he was going to. “ Your Wurr-
shop,” protested the sergeant, “he’s got the
money. Oi’ve got noine pounds of his at the
station.” “ Can’t help it,” said the Bench, “we
can’t make him pay; ” and the disappointed
sergeant was ordered to take the culprit away.
Arrived at the lock-up Mullarty gave up the £9,
opened the door and passed Frank out. “Get
out’er this, yer dirthy loafer ! It’s the loikes o’
you that gets the bleeding counthry into debt!
Go on away now ! ” That night Frank got
paralytically drunk again, and was “ performing”
when Sergeant Mullarty arrived upon the scene.
“If yer (hie) don’t leave me (hie) alone,”
stuttered the lover of “three stars,” “I’ll (hie)
come back for them (hie) 14 days yer owe me.”
Whereupon Sergeant Mullarty “gat.”
Essay on Yictoria by a nine-year-old Melb.
boy : —■
Victoria is the lowest colony of Australia. Some people
say the climate is salubrous, but these people are wrong
altogether. The sudden changes from heat to cold, and
vesa-versa, are awfull, the thermometer often dropping 50
degrease in a couple of hours. The soil is very fertile,
producing grain, fruit, gold, sheep and cattle in great
abundans. Victoria has many strange animals, including
the wonderfull kangeroo and platipuss. The platipus,
which lives mostly on eels, has a beutiful skin, softer than
a cat’s, a bill like a duck, and paws like a human-being.
The kangaro walks uprite, and can balance itself on the
tip of its tail, which is often 10 feet long. When chased,
it has been known to jump a river 20 yards wide. The
flying-fox is exactly like a bat, only 50 times larger, it lives
on gum leaves and bees, and has deadly poisonus claws.
Another queer animal is the native bear, which sleeps in
the day time hanging by its tale from a branch. It lives
mostly on lisards and is very prevalent in some parts.
Melbourne the capital is situate at the mouth of the Yarra
which smells awful, it has run up very quick and forty
years ago had only about 20 houses most of which were
tents. Now it has buildings 20 storys high. Much money
though has been wasted in useless buildings such as the
Exibition, Parliament and Govement houses. There
are many fine places of amusment, including theatres,
the Zoo, churches, waxwurks, hotels, the morgue, and
cathedrils. Most Melbourne people have little money
nowadays, having been swindeld out of it by the banks,
etsetera.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inforin our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ TZHUELZEIE CASTLES” and tc CAPS X’AAESL. 75
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to .the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “ Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“Three Castles” and “ Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

In an English paper we find a professor of
mathematics describing a theory thus :
If you bored a hole through the earth—say, roughly,
from New York to Melbourne —and dropped your gold
watch into that hole, it would go right through to Mel-
bourne, and immediately start on its return journey to you.
Would it? Is it possible in this so-called 19th
century, five years after the boom, that a learned
British professor knows so little of Melbourne? /

Time will prove even to the satisfaction of Mr.
Julius Price, the special artist and correspondent of Lon-
don Illustrated News, that in writing of the W.A. gold-
fields he has made an ass of himself. Pages of gold-gush
have already appeared, of which this childish, very-Eng-

rarely take to mining', but there is an
,°™ h s ® a Islander working as a hatter near Pyramid
(JN 8.W.). He says he has dreamt that there is rich gold
behind a hard bar of granite, and he has been blasting
away at it for some months past. He has some money in
the havings Bank and drives hard bargains at the store
for his explosives and “tucker.” Although there are
thousands of natives about the Thames goldfields (M L )
this writer only knew one Maori who worked under-

Te Aroha goldfield, and died of consumption contracted
through the hardships he had endured in his career as a
prospector.

A returning miner, writingto aN.S. Wales M.P.
describes Coolgardie as the goldfield of many disappoint-
ments ; sickness is the only thing that is plentiful; 90 per
cent, of the mines are duffers, and the balance will pay
only after big money for plant and water. He thinks the
Eastern Govts should do their best to stop the mad rush
The Bulletin thinks so, too. It rises to propose
that the Eastralian Premiers should send a joint cable to
Chamberlain warning the British public that more than
nine-tenths of the W.A. mines floated in London are
proved \v lid cats, and that there is every reason to
believe that evgn this proportion will be exceeded if the
boom is not stopped. What business of theirs? Well
Australasia will have to suffer for these gigantic robberies!
The fact that the bulk of the plunder remains in London
does not affect the issue.
* * * *
I lie latest Coolgardie writer warns everybody
to keep away save the trained miner, and even he is ur fr ed
to come in moderation. “ Even if a man has means there
is no business to engage in. The Chosen People are there
as plentiful as swallows in summer, and what they are
disposed to leave alone in the way of genteel easy occupa-
tions the Unchosen could not earn water au”

Broken Hill Water Supply Co. has received a
knock from which it will take many months to recover.
The Broken Hill municipality selected a sylvan retreat
among the hills for its nightsoil depot, said retreat being
between the town and the creek. Opinions have always
been divided as to whether the site did not actually form
P ar ri “*? watershed ; and, while holding that it didn’t,
the Council salved its conscience by building an embank-
ment at the bottom of the gully. But, a week or two
ago, heavy thunderstorms came, burst the embankment,
and carried the material for the trenches certainly in the
direction of the creek. The interested authorities pro-
claim that “ none of it reached the reservoir ” (which, by
the way, has more water in it than ever it had before,
these particular storms having added over 400 million
gallons), but that “it was deposited over the plains.”
That may be true ; but, whether it is or not, while people
have a drop of another brand of water they certainly
won t be taking any from the co.’s service.

The stacks of ore on the British grow steadily,
shipments having ceased as the finishing-touches are put
upon the big concentrating mill. But, though late
developments have been satisfactory, the ore is, com-
paratively speaking, patchy, both as to quantity and
quality.

Barrier miners are apparently recovering from
the defeat of ’92. They have had a little strike at the
Pinnacles dragging wearily on, over just some such
trumpery matter as has more than once hitherto brought
trouble to this unfortunate property. A good deaf of
pegging-out has, by the way, been done in the Pinnacles
district lately ; Pritchard Morgan has been introduced to
that part.
* * * *
Horn Island lies close to Thursday, and not a
rifle-shot from the well-advertised Hammond Island bat-
tery. Nine-tenths of the miners on Horn Island are backed
by Thursday Island business men, officials, &c. A five-head
stamper battery erected by Mr. A. Rodgers has done good
work there lately. The first noteworthy crushing came
from the Eclipse—ll2oz. from 30 tons ; the Triumph
crushed 100 tons for an average of l£oz. ; the Bonanza
turned out 15 tons for 450 z., while the Good Luck crushed
60 tons for 60oz. Working miners, unless they can lie
back a couple of months, need not go there, as prices are
stiff (corned beef sd. a lb., steak 6d.) and work for the
next month or two will be partially suspended.
* » * »
The colored-labor question is causing trouble at
Horn Island. A welt-known Indian applied to the
warden for a miner’s right, which was refused for the
time being. Ultimately the authorities decided it should
be granted, inasmuch as the applicant was a British sub-
wet. Affairs now stand thusly—any South Sea Islander
born under British rule may claim the “ right,” and, as
some of the claims on Horn Island are already manned
by Polynesians, there is trouble brewing for Northern
miners.

Re lucky diggers : When Gymoie broke out the
two Lords, Bob and Fred, bought a claim for £2 from a
party who had sunk 14ft. on the Caledonian line and got
nothing. The Lords set to work and sank a new shaft,
and one day, during a storm, the one who was on top
whilst his brother was working below, strolled up to the
old shaft, and on a heap of wet mullock lying at its
mouth he found some gold. He picked up a few oz., and
next day they began work at the old shaft and found that
the former owners had sunk right on to the gold before
abandoning it, and, in fact, had stripped a couple of feet
of the reef the whole length of the shaft. This reef had
been washed by the water when it ran down the shaft,
and gold was showing all over it. In three weeks the
u-u ~ o£ a bout 2000 oz. of specimens, and one of these,
which was sent to Sydney to be exhibited, contained over
" v! Sold. In a month this run of gold was worked out,
and besides the specimens they got 120 tons of crushing
stone which yielded lOoz. to the ton, making in all about
3200 oz.—won in about six weeks on an original investment
of £2.

Summary of Queensland’s gold productions:—
Charters Towers goldfield (area, 320 square miles) has,
since discovery, to 1895 yielded 3,363,0000 z., of the
value of £12,000,000 sterling. Gympie comes next
with 2,000,0000 z. ; then Rockhampton, with 1,470,0000 z. ;
Palmer, 1,350,0000 z. ; Etheridge (area, 400 square miles),
530,0000 z. ; Calliope, Hodgkinson, &c., 780,0000 z. Alto-
gether the record for Queensland up to 1895 equals
10,625,0000 z. of gold—value, £39,843,750. “ Westralia,”
said a Northern miner indignantly, the other day, “why,
we’ve got a Westralia in our tailings ! ”
* * # *
Gold has hitherto been the chief Victorian
mining 1 industry, and accordingly its mining acts have
been framed with especial reference to that branch. Now
that coal-mines are studding Gippsland, a more general
mining law is badly needed. The Regulation of Mines
Act happens to include coal-mines, but the phraseology of
the sections isn’t always apropos ; the Mines Act proper
only applies to mining on Crown lands, whereas nearly all
the coal is on private lands. A colliery explosion is not
the most desirable means of drawing attention to serious
omissions in a country’s legislation. Agitation is all the
more necessary, because the subject does not immediately
interest the purely mining M’sP., and only incidentally
the agricultural Gippsland members.
* * * *
The Chinese are rapidly eating up Gippsland.
Wherever there is a bit of alluvial in a creek there is a
settlement of Chows fossicking assiduously for the last
weight., and getting it. This is rough on white pro-
spectors, who have hitherto been able to fall back upon
the creeks for tucker when hard pressed in their hunt for
the reef. The obnoxious Chow does not prospect, he never
pioneers, and his depredations tremendously handicap the
whites who do.

With about half its batteries idle, Bendigo is
awaking to the idiocy of equipping each mine with
crushing machinery. Where haulage is easy, and at
Bendigo it generally is, a big central mill would do the
woik muchjnore cheaply and effectively,
Tasmania’s past five years’ mineral output :
Gold, 382,1380 z., £1,435,724; silver ore, 53,954 tons,
£557,030 ; tin, 15,198 tons, £1,207,776 ; coal, 177,154 tons,
£152,917 —’95 the lowest, £612,401; ’94 the best, £820,267.
February s yields were close on £50,000, an increase of
£BOOO on the previous month.
* * * *
Great interest is being displayed in the Glencoe
experiment at Croydon (Q.), which will settle the value of
the treatment there of big low-grade ore bodies by dry
crushing and cyanidation.
* * * *
Mt. Lyell railway due for opening in July next.

The agitation for State batteries grows in Vic-
toria with the spread of prospecting. It has been a Govt,
policy for years, since the first bitterness of boom after-
math, to rush men on to settlement, or set them gouging
mother-earth after quartz reefs. Now, those triers who
have been fortunate enough to hit stone are either on
their beam-ends for the want of a mill, or are compelled
to see all their profits scooped by carters and mill-owners.
Mines-Minister Foster declares he is anxious to dot the
country with little mills, but cannot see how it is
to be done on a business basis. Prospecting in good
districts would receive a tremendous impetus by the ap-
pearance of public mills, where crushing would be well
done at reasonable rates. Without such assistance, scores
of small reefs, in Gippsland particularly, must remain un-
workable for years, or until the gold-saving appliance
comes along.

The Benefit of Clergy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As Father Connolly reached the door of the
Squatters’ Rest a dozen arms were stretched out
to hold his horse and help him alight.
“It’s a hot ride you’ve ’ad, sure, father?” said
the buxom proprietress.
“ Faith, hot’s no name for it, Mrs. Dargan. Is
there anything left in my bottle ? ”
“ Well, it’s close on four months since you was
’ere, yer reverence; but I’ve got some good old
Irish tack ye’re welcome to.”
“That’s right, mother. Let’s have some, an a
bite, too, for I’m off again immediately.”
“ Yer won’t be stayin’ the night, then?”
“No. I’ve a sick-call at Bull-bull Station, and
I must start again at once and get there to-night. ”
“ I’m sorry for yer hurry, father, for there’s
some business for yer here. ” _
“ Indade ! And what moight it be ? ”
“ Well, father, there’s Mary. She be near her
toime to Ted Hogan, at Howlong; an’ they want’s
joinin’.”
“ Call ’em in, mother.”
Mrs. Dargan went out of the parlor, and soon
came back followed by Mary and her lover, a hard-
faced young boundary-rider, who, fortunately for
himself and the object of his affections, had ridden
over to the Squatters’ Rest that morning.
“So,” said the priest, sternly, “ so, you’ve not
had the dacency to wait my cornin’ ? ”
The young couple made no reply.
“ How do you expect to obtain a blessin’,” con-
tinued the priest, “when you stale the joys of
matrimony widout God’s leave? Kneel down, the
pair of you. Now, say the words afther me. Mrs.
Dargan, call all hands in as witnesses.”
For some minutes the ceremony proceeded; then
the priest asked, “ Mary O’Neill, do you take this
man for your husband ? ”
“ Yer ain’t asked ’im if ’e’ll ’ave me first,
Father.” . TT
“ Silence, you hussy. Will you have him < He
is going to marry you.”
“Yes, yer Riverince.”
“ That’s right. There now, you are man and
wife, and God bless you ! ”
“ Whisky all round, mother,” cried Ted Hogan,
and all joined in the toast which followed.
“ Is there anything else now, Mrs. Dargan ? ”
asked the priest,'pocketing the pound-note given
him by the newly-wedded man.
“ Yis, yer Riverence ; there’s a baptism.”
“Whose is the infant?”
“It’s Jane’s, father.”
“ Jane ! She’s not married ! ”
“Ah ! poor thing, father, she’s in a bad way,
an’ her man won’t be here this side Christmas.”
“ Who is he ? ”
“ Alick MTntyre, the bullocky.”
“ Heavens ! the sin, the sin of it all ! Fetch the
mother and child in at once.” _ .
A pale young woman was brought in, bearing m
her arms a fine little boy a month or two old.
“ Ah ! Jane, you’ve been in a devil of a hurry,”
said the priest, not unkindly. “ Who stand
sponsors for this child ? God bless him ! He’s a
beauty, too.” . ,
A toothless old raobiter in for a spree, and a
young fellow from a neighboring selection, stepped
forward, and the ceremony was soon over.
“ There, Jane, my girl, the little one is as pure
as snow now. But what’s all these tears for ?
Mrs. Dargan, what’s wrong ? ”
The women-folk, as if by magic, had all begun
to sob ; and the men stood here and there convers-
ing in whispers and looking very glum.
“Come now, mother, what’s the maning of it
all ? ” asked the priest again, and impatiently this
time.
“ Ah ! father, there’s pretty Nellie yet.”
“ An’ what, in heaven’s name, is wrong with
her—the angel of the flock? The pride of the
Big Gum Plain. The flower among so many
weeds.”
There was a ring of alarm in the old man’s
tones, and he looked anxiously from one to the
other.
“ Faith, father, it’s buryin’ she wants.”
“ Burying ? Nellie dead ! No, no. So bright,
so fair. The queen of you all ! Not dead ! ”
“ Indade, father.”
“ Take me to her.”
“ She’s all nicely laid out, wid a pretty coffin,
too, made by Ted, here. The poor lamb died
yester-morn.”
Mrs. Dargan led the priest into an adjoining
room where, on a stretcher, lay the body of poor
Nellie. She had been a very beautiful girl, and
even Death could not rob her perfect features of
their charm. The long golden hair had been care-
fully brushed and trained down each side of the
reclining figure. On her breast was a bunch of
wild flowers.
“ She’s bin ailin’ since your last visit, father.
The young gentleman from Mooraboo run was
after her, and Nellie was very fond of him. But
the dam blackguard, savin’ your presence, father,
wint away an’ got spliced to a lady in Adelaide,
an’ our girl here broke her poor heart an’ died. ”
Mrs. Dargan told her tale with many sobs.
“ And was she innocent, do you think, mother ? ”
asked the priest anxiously.
“ More’s the pity, no, Father. She ”
“God, God! The sin, the sin! Poor lamb,
to be wrecked by that son of the devil. Wait
until 1 meet him, which, plase Heaven, will be
soon ! Now bring all hands in, Mrs. Dargan, and
I’ll say prayers.”
And when it was over he spoke to them about
the savage way they were living, and said the
back-blocks should be called the Black-blocks, for
there was no light there. And an hour later,
after Nellie’s body had been placed in the rough
grave prepared for it, Father Connolly took his
leave of the shanty and its inmates, blessing them
all from his seat in the saddle. And as he rode
away a tear trickled down his face. “ Lord !” he
cried, “when will women know men?”
ALEX, ALLEN.
The North Melt), and Prahran branches of
the A.N.A. met the other night to contest the
final heat of a talking tournament. Subject :
“ Should Military Service be Compulsory in Aus-
tralia.” The judges were Sir Righteous Wrixon,
Dr. Embling, M.L.C., and a third gentleman who
is not yet renowned for blue toryism. North
Melbourne argued against compulsory soldiering,
and talked rings round the other fellows. Then
Wrixon and Embling wagged their heads vigor-
ously at the third judge, and the chairman decided
that Prahran had won by 18 points. Which
clearly proves that Australia must have a standing
army or perish—in the opinion of the patriot who
passed a Bill prohibiting radical Sunday news-
papers in Victoria. The Bulletin would like to
judge a debate on the question whether Wrixons
and Emblings are a worse disease for a young
country than small-pox.
A Licensed Pub.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I had come about twenty miles from the station,
and, reaching the top of the range, was reining in
my horse to listen to the music of the bell-birds
when the warning of the station hand came back
to me vividly : “ As the wind’s favorable, you 11
probably smell it on the top of the big range ;
that’s three miles away. ” , ,
“ It ” became more and more obvious as the
three miles turned to two, and the two to one.
Several tracks doubled in and out through the
trees of the sandy flat, and crossed each other here
and there. Earth, trees, and air were tainted.
The truth came to me : “ It ” comprised not only
a pub., but an extensive piggery. The grunting
and squealing drowned all other voices of nature
within a half-mile radius.
The pub. was of slabs, bark-and-log roofed. A
big boar was half asleep on the verandah ; a litter
was disporting in a large hole wherein a team had
sunk up to the axle a few days before and had
been dug out. I tied my horse to a verandah-post
and read the sign over the bar-door, “
— , to sell fermented and spirituous
liquors.” The bar which drinkers breasted was
painted white, and across its front and rudely
printed with a tar-brush was : “ I am a bit of a
liar meself, but ”
On the bar-floor sat a great, muscular ruffian,
naked but for a pair of trousers and one heavy
blucher boot. Pie looked so filthy that he might
have just come in from wallowing in the piggery.
He took no notice of my entrance, but with his
naked left foot in his lap and a butcher’s knife in
his right hand he went on cutting his toe-nails.
“ Where’s the boss ? ” I asked.
The animal raised a grisly face with matted,
filthy hair and beard, and looking out from two
small, cruel, bleary eyes, vented a half-drunken
grunt —“Can’t you blanky well see?”
“ Oh, you’re the boss ! I want a drink.”
The Boss arose, stuck his knife into a slab, and
went behind the bar. “ Whatelyouav ? ” His
tone and manner gave me to understand that his
stock was comprehensive and first-class.
‘ ‘ Lager beer ! ”
“ Ranhoutalager a week ago—won’t ’ave none
till the teams come back.”
“ Bottled English beer ! ”
“ Got no beer; sent last case away two days
hago to the station; big picnic’shon there. ”
“ Wine, then ! ”
“ Sent the last bottle to a sick selector’s wife last
night. ”
“Soda, lemonade !”
“ No call for them soft tack hout ’ere.”
He had only the dosed nicotine stuff—some of
it called rum, the rest whisky.
I asked him to have a whisky with me, and gave
him half-a-crown. We gulped down the liquid
lightning.
He kept the half-crown in the till. “ ’Ave
hanother,”he said. We had; he kept the half-
crown.
Suddenly loud words, followed almost instantly
by a fierce scuffle, burst upon us from the next
room. The publican rushed from behind his bar
and opened a side-door. On the floor of the room
two shearers, who had been playing cards on a
whisky-case, were struggling savagely. Their
drink-mad eyes were starting from their sockets ;
their teeth were clenched with fury ; white froth
was on one man’s lips. This madman grasped a
large, open clasp-knife, but the other held his
wrist in the grip of a vyce. The burly publican
dashed forward and kicked the man with the knife
on the point of the jaw, stretching him out sense-
less. Then he kicked the other in the ribs, with
such force that the wretch nearly went through
the door. Springing to his feet with a loud cry
of agony and fear, he ran out upon the track,
staggering like a mortally-wounded animal. After
going 50 yards his legs gave way, and he came
down with a thud. The publican took the uncon-
scious one from off the door by the nape of the
neck and seat of the trousers, and Hung him out
some yards in front of the bar. Then, standing
in the'bar door-way, with his arms folded across
liis Herculean chest, the boss of the shanty roared
in a voice of iron : “ I’ll ’ave harder in my ’ouse,
an’ no blanky fightin’.”
S.A.M.
Dear Bulletin, —A few curious names of
places: “ Come-bv Chance,” “Colley Blue,”
“Four Bob,” “Ward’s Mistake,” “Jumping
Sandhills,” “Holy Box,” “Mother of Ducks.”
And these aboriginal names of places, all within
cooee of the Murray : Adjintoothbong, Bringem-
bong, Thologolong, Tangambalanga, Thillinga-
langa, Mudgegonga, Murramurrangbong, Carra-
garmungee, Boomanamoonah ; also the birthplace
of the writer, Rowdy Flat, Yackandandah. —
How’s That.
The “ Lormer’s Board” enquiry main-
tained its reputation for revelations and humor
right up to the finish. “Beak” Bird, the clown
of the show, weighed in with a speech for his own
defence, in which he stated that, after receiving
the magisterial toga from the hands of the chair-
man’s revered sire, he rambled out into the Rich-
mond paddock, or somewhere, and meditated on
the duties of his position. After much meditation
he decided to become the champion of young girls
who might be tempted by Aspasia to their moral
death, and he has been championing them accord-
ingly. Barrister Maxwell, on behalf of the Crown,
didn’t think it worth while to show cause why
this nice old gentleman should be shoved off the
Bench, because the necessity for his immediate
removal was sticking out a mile. Mr. Maxwell,
however, went to a good deal of trouble in attack-
ing Lormer, the man for whom he had practically
held a Crown brief throughout the proceedings.
Having duly enlarged upon the unfitness of teeto-
tal Lormer to adjudicate in hotel cases, the strictly
impartial Maxwell turned round and administered
a very nasty jar to the Crown Law Office, from
which he got his brief. Maxwell, on this matter,
was very interesting. Hear him! “The Minister
of Justice called upon Mr. Lormer to supply him
with particulars of the matters (Bench scandals)
referred to, and, as a result, the Board was ap-
pointed. Objections had been raised to the
higgledy-piggledy manner in which the case was
presented, but, in justice to himself, he (Maxwell)
must say that the initial dilatoriness on the part
of the Crown had seriously hampered him through-
out the whole of the enquiry. He had been work-
ing against time all the while. ”

AYER’S SARSAPARILLA

Mr. Alfred 0. Jolliffs, of Granville, So. Australia, whose portrait we
give above, writes:
“I used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla in England for years before coming to
Australia. At times I was much troubled with boils and other eruptions
of the skin, caused, the doctors told me, by the running down of my
system and general debility. The only medicine that has ever done me
lasting good is Ayer's Sarsaparilla, which has always cured me—purifying
my blood, and giving me new life and health and vigour.”
The wonderful success of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla in purifying the blood and
restoring health and strength to systems enfeebled by disease, or the enervate
ing effect of a warm climate, has led to the placing on the market of other
preparations called Sarsaparilla. Remember that imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery, and be sure that you get AYER’S SARSAPARILLA
which has stood the test of time, has won the highest awards at the world’s
great expositions, and has been a blessing to the people of Australia, and
all civilized countries, for more than a generation. No other medicine operates
so effectually in removing general debility, languor, and all outward symp-
toms of the grave mischief caused by disordered nerves and impure blood.
